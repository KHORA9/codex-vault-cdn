E. R. [JANE ELIZABETH ROSCOE].\r\n\r\n     _The Winter's Wreath, 1832._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUDUBON THE NATURALIST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nEXPLORATIONS IN FLORIDA AND THE SOUTH ATLANTIC\r\n\r\n     Obituary published in London on day of his arrival in\r\n     New York—Assistance from the Government—John Bachman\r\n     becomes his friend—Winter in Charleston—His folios\r\n     as gifts—To Florida with two assistants—Letters to\r\n     Featherstonhaugh—St. Augustine—Misadventures in the\r\n     mud of East Florida—Audubon on Florida's future—At the\r\n     sources of the St. John's—Aboard the _Marion_—Return\r\n     from Key West—A merchant of Savannah—Disbanding of party\r\n     at Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1831 Audubon felt that he must again return to America\r\nand extend his researches to the north, south and west, as well as\r\nbegin a campaign for subscribers in the United States. His large folio\r\nwas now running into its second volume, and the first installment of\r\nhis text had been published; the time was favorable to his plans, and\r\nhe hoped to remain in the country two or three years.\r\n\r\nFor the second time the publication of his plates was entrusted to\r\nfriend Children, and with Mrs. Audubon he set sail for New York on\r\nAugust 2, 1831. From the American metropolis he wrote to Joseph B. Kidd\r\non September 7 as follows:[1]\r\n\r\n     We landed on the 3d ... [of September] after a\r\n     remarkably fine passage of 33 days. In two days more I\r\n     proceed to the woods, and away from white man's tracks\r\n     and manners. I hope you are going on well with your\r\n     work.... I have a new subscriber here. The papers and\r\n     scientific journals (we have not many,) are singing\r\n     the praises of my work, and, God willing, I may yet\r\n     come out at the broad end of the horn; at all events,\r\n     I will either _break it or make a spoon_! I shot\r\n     sixteen birds on the passage, which I got through the\r\n     kind attention of our commander. I killed fifty more,\r\n     when the \"Columbia\" was going too fast to stop for the\r\n     purpose of picking them up. My young man is now busily\r\n     engaged in skinning, and killed a bag-full of warblers\r\n     yesterday ... prices of peaches, first quality, 75 cents\r\n     per bushel,—apples, half that price;—water melons are\r\n     dull of sale, as also cantelopes and nutmeg melons. Fish\r\n     alive in the markets, and, _vive la joie_, no taxes on\r\n     shooting or fishing.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Audubon actually did was to proceed to Philadelphia, where Mrs.\r\nAudubon left him to visit her sons in Louisville, and where he laid\r\nhis plans for exploring the Southern States, especially the islands and\r\neastern coast of the Florida peninsula. For this expedition he engaged\r\ntwo assistants, one of whom was Henry Ward, the \"young man\" mentioned\r\nabove, an Englishman who had come with him to America as taxidermist,\r\nwhile the other was George Lehman, a Swiss landscape painter whom he\r\nseems to have found at Philadelphia. With them he soon started for\r\nWashington to obtain assistance from the Government.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that Audubon landed in New York, there appeared in\r\nthe _London Literary Gazette_ a serio-comic notice under the title\r\nof \"Wilson the Ornithologist,\" who, it may be remembered, had died in\r\nPhiladelphia eighteen years before. Said the editor of the _Gazette_:\r\n\r\n     We observe with sorrow an account of the death and\r\n     burial of poor Wilson, somewhere in the state of\r\n     Philadelphia, even while the Edinburgh journals\r\n     are anticipating his return, laden with scientific\r\n     treasures. We have now before us No. 1 of his\r\n     Illustrations of American Ornithology, on a reduced\r\n     scale, to sort with Professor Jameson's edition—a pretty\r\n     and attractive publication. The coloured prints are\r\n     extremely correct and well done.\r\n\r\nWhen on September 8 the Edinburgh _Caledonian Mercury_ had called\r\nattention to this egregious blunder regarding Wilson, the _Gazette_\r\nexplained that his name had been confused with that of Audubon,\r\nwhose obituary presently appeared in its issue of October 29, the\r\neditor remarking that this naturalist's death was equally, if not\r\nmore, to be deplored than that of Wilson. Captain Brown then sent\r\nto the _Caledonian Mercury_ Audubon's letter to Kidd, quoted above,\r\nwhich was written from New York four days after the naturalist's\r\ndeath was announced in England. \"What is the editor of the Literary\r\nGazette about,\" exclaimed a writer in the Edinburgh paper; \"he first\r\nresuscitates a man who has been dead 18 years, only to kill him again,\r\nand then, by way of correcting his error, kills another, who is now\r\nclearly proved to have been alive and well several days after the date\r\nof his obituary in London.\"\r\n\r\nAs was often the case, Audubon's ambitious hopes for exploring the\r\ncontinent far outran his means and powers of accomplishment. Colonel\r\nJohn James Abert, whose counsel he sought in Washington at this time;\r\nsaid:[2] \"His plan is first to examine the peninsula of Florida; then\r\nthe regions west of the Mississippi, Mexico, and if possible penetrate\r\ninto California. He also contemplates crossing the Rocky Mountains and\r\npursuing the Columbia River to its mouth, and thinks that he will be\r\nabsent from us about two years.\" In November G. W. Featherstonhaugh,\r\nthe geologist, also made this announcement in his _Monthly American\r\nJournal of Geology and Natural Science_:\r\n\r\n     We are authorized to state that information of the\r\n     progress of Mr. Audubon will be given, from time to\r\n     time, to the scientific world, in the pages of this\r\n     journal.\r\n\r\n     We are gratified in being able to state, that he was\r\n     received in the most cordial manner, at Washington, and\r\n     that the distinguished gentlemen in authority there,\r\n     have given him such letters to the military posts on the\r\n     frontiers, as will assure him the aid and protection\r\n     his personal safety may require. We anticipate the\r\n     most interesting reconnaisances, both geological and\r\n     zoölogical, from this enterprising naturalist, who is\r\n     accompanied by Mr. Lehman, as an assistant draftsman,\r\n     and by an assistant collector who came with him from\r\n     Europe.\r\n\r\nThe \"distinguished gentlemen\" at Washington who particularly aided\r\nAudubon at this time, besides Colonel Abert, were Edward Everett,\r\nLevi Woodbury, Secretary of the Navy, and Lewis McLane, Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury. He was particularly anxious to obtain accommodation for\r\nhis party aboard a government vessel, but it was some time before a\r\nsuitable one was available. They left Washington about October 15,\r\n1831, and went by steamer to Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia, where\r\nthe Governor, John Floyd, whom Audubon had known in his Kentucky\r\ndays, gave him numerous letters of introduction. At Charleston, their\r\nnext stopping-place, he had hardly begun work in the field when he\r\nwas sought out by the Rev. John Bachman, by inclination a naturalist\r\nof the old school and by profession a Lutheran minister, who at once\r\ntook the whole party under his hospitable roof, where they remained\r\na month. Thus began a life-long and almost ideal friendship between\r\nthese two men, so unlike in character, in temperament and in training,\r\nwhich was quite as important to the modest German-American divine\r\nas to the impulsive Franco-American painter and student of birds. It\r\nwas Audubon's infectious enthusiasm which kindled to an ardent flame\r\nthat love of nature which was innate in Bachman, and which eventually\r\nbrought his name and work to the attention of the scientific world.\r\n\r\nAudubon remained at Charleston with the Bachmans until November 15,\r\nwhen the opportunity which they had awaited came suddenly, and they\r\nsailed for St. Augustine, Florida, on the government schooner _Agnes_.\r\nOn that day Bachman wrote to Mrs. Audubon, in compliance \"with a\r\nrequest of your kind and worthy husband, who laid an injunction on me\r\nthis morning\":[3]\r\n\r\n     The last has been one of the happiest months of my life.\r\n     I was an enthusiastic admirer of nature from my boyhood,\r\n     and fond of every branch of Natural History. Ornithology\r\n     is, as a science, pursued by very few persons—and by\r\n     none in this city. How gratifying was it, then, to\r\n     become acquainted with a man, who knew more about birds\r\n     than any man now living—and who, at the same time, was\r\n     communicative, intelligent, and amiable, to an extent\r\n     seldom found associated in the same individual. He has\r\n     convinced me that I was but a novice in the study; and\r\n     besides receiving many lessons from him in Ornithology,\r\n     he has taught me how much can be accomplished by a\r\n     single individual, who will unite enthusiasm with\r\n     industry. For the short month he remained with my\r\n     family, we were inseparable. We were engaged in talking\r\n     about Ornithology—in collecting birds—in seeing them\r\n     prepared, and in laying plans for the accomplishment of\r\n     that great work which he has undertaken. Time passed\r\n     rapidly away, and it seems but as yesterday since we\r\n     met, and now, alas! he is already separated from me—and\r\n     in all human probability we shall never meet again....\r\n     I need not inform you that Mr. Audubon was a general\r\n     favorite in our city. His gentlemanly deportment, his\r\n     travels and experience, his information and general\r\n     talents, caused him to be sought after by all. But your\r\n     husband knew that the great objects before him required\r\n     his unremitted attention, and he was obliged to deny\r\n     himself to his friends, on many occasions, and devoted\r\n     to them only his evenings.\r\n\r\n     There seems quite a blank, in my house, since he has\r\n     gone, for we looked on him as one of our family. He\r\n     taught my sister, Maria, to draw birds; and she has now\r\n     such a passion for it, that whilst I am writing, she\r\n     is drawing a Bittern, put up for her at daylight by Mr.\r\n     Audubon.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: \"BEECHGROVE,\" WILLIAM GARRETT JOHNSON'S PLANTATION\r\n    HOUSE IN WEST FELICIANA PARISH, LOUISIANA, WHERE MRS. AUDUBON\r\n    LIVED AND TAUGHT FOR TWO YEARS, 1827-1829.\r\n\r\n    After a photograph by Mr. Stanley Clisby Arthur, 1916.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JOHN BACHMAN'S HOUSE IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n    After a photograph in possession of Mr. Ruthven Deane.]\r\n\r\nOn December 23 Bachman wrote to Audubon: \"Your visit to me gave me\r\nnew life, induced me to go carefully over my favorite study, and\r\nmade me and my family happy.\" His sister-in-law, Miss Maria Martin,\r\nwho possessed considerable artistic talent, became one of Audubon's\r\nenthusiastic helpers, and not only drew birds for him but painted many\r\nof the flowers and insects which were later used for the embellishment\r\nof his plates. John Bachman's serious contributions to natural history\r\nalso date from this visit. To repay him and his family for their\r\nhospitality, Audubon presented them with the first volume of _The Birds\r\nof America_, but the folio was not received until some time later; he\r\nwas referring to this when he wrote to Bachman, just before sailing\r\nfrom New York, on April 5, 1834, and asked him to accept \"the superbly\r\nbound book\" from \"your old Friend, in part atonement for the troubles\r\nI have given you, and the leatherings you may yet receive at my hands\r\nat chess.\" In a letter to Miss Martin, written also from New York on\r\nthe following day, he said: \"The Great Volume which Maj. Glassel did\r\nfortunately return into your hands, I give with all my heart to my\r\nvalued friends, the Bachmans, and shall try to furnish them the sequel\r\nin like binding.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAudubon scattered detached plates and numbers of his large work freely\r\namong his friends, and sometimes spoke of a gift of the whole. The\r\ncostly nature of such a present in most cases, no doubt, led to a\r\nchange of mind if not of heart, but not in all, for a number of his\r\npresentation copies still exist. One was given to David Eckley[5] of\r\nBoston, a noted sportsman who had aided Audubon in collecting materials\r\nfor his work. In a letter written at Charleston, January 1, 1837, to\r\nyoung Thomas M. Brewer, Audubon said: \"Please to call on my good friend\r\nDavid Eckley, Esq., present to him and to his family my very best\r\nregards, and ask of him whether he has collected any hawks or owls for\r\nme. If so, take them from him, and place them in the general receptacle\r\nof 'pale-faced rum.'\" Another copy is said to be in possession of the\r\nPublic Library of Manchester, England, and to have been bequeathed to\r\nthat institution by the Earl of Crawford. A complete set of the _Birds_\r\nwas also presented to his friends, the Rathbones of Liverpool, and\r\nis still in possession of the family.\r\n\r\nWe shall now return to our narrative and fulfill our promise of\r\nreproducing Audubon's own account of his journey from Richmond to\r\nFlorida:[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to G. W. Featherstonhaugh_\r\n\r\n     I am now seated in earnest to give you an unceremonious\r\n     summary of my proceedings up to this time, since we\r\n     left Richmond, in Virginia. As a geologist, I venture\r\n     to suppose you would have been but indifferently\r\n     amused, if you had been with us in our journey from\r\n     this latter place to Charleston, in South Carolina; and\r\n     as an ornithologist, I cannot boast of the enjoyment I\r\n     found; poor coaches, dragged through immense, deserted\r\n     pine forests, miserable fare, and neither birds\r\n     nor quadrupeds to be seen. We at length approached\r\n     Charleston, and the view of that city from across the\r\n     bay was hailed by our party with unfeigned delight.\r\n     Charmed, as we were, with having terminated our dreary\r\n     journey, it did not occur to us to anticipate the\r\n     extraordinary hospitality which awaited us there, and\r\n     which led to a residence of a few of the happiest weeks\r\n     I ever passed.\r\n\r\n     I had passed but one night in the city, when I was\r\n     presented to the Rev. Mr. ——. This benevolent man,\r\n     whom I am proud to call my friend would not suffer\r\n     the \"American Woodsman\" to repose any where but under\r\n     his roof; and not him alone—all his assistants too.\r\n     When I tell you that he was an old friend of Alexander\r\n     Wilson, that he shoots well, is an ornithologist, a\r\n     philosophical naturalist, and that during the time we\r\n     enjoyed his hospitality, he took us all over the country\r\n     with his carriages and servants, in search of specimens,\r\n     and that he was every thing a kind brother could be to\r\n     me, you may suppose that it is with great sincerity I\r\n     say, and ever shall say, God bless him! When I first\r\n     saw this excellent man, he was on horseback, but upon my\r\n     being named to him, he leaped from his saddle, suffered\r\n     his horse to stand at liberty, and gave me his hand\r\n     with a pressure of cordiality that electrified me. I\r\n     saw in his eyes that all he said was good and true; and\r\n     although he spoke of my labours in terms far exceeding\r\n     what is due to them, I listened to him pretty well\r\n     assured that he did not intend me to play the part of\r\n     Gil Blas over again; for myself, my assistants, George\r\n     Lehman and Henry Ward, were removed in a jiffy to his\r\n     own mansion, introduced to the family, and at work the\r\n     very next morning.\r\n\r\nAlthough the weather was \"shockingly hot,\" they prepared three hundred\r\nspecimens, embracing about sixty land and water birds, and sent all\r\nthe \"pickled specimens to our mutual friend H——\" [Dr. Harlan, of\r\nPhiladelphia] for safe keeping until their return.\r\n\r\n     I jumped at once into my wood-hunting habits. All\r\n     hands of us were up before day-break, and soon at work,\r\n     either in the way of shooting, taking views, or drawing\r\n     birds; after sunset—scribbling in our journals....\r\n     In the early part of November the alligators had gone\r\n     into their winter quarters; the migratory birds were\r\n     passing swiftly on towards the south, although we had\r\n     had no frost. The planters considered the country as\r\n     still unhealthy, and resorted to the city at night. If\r\n     I had been governed by the practice and advice of many,\r\n     I should not have put a foot in the mud, either salted\r\n     or fresh; but difficulties of this character must be\r\n     disregarded by the American woodsman, while success, or\r\n     the hope of it, is before him.\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to do justice to the generous feelings\r\n     of the Charlestonians, or to their extreme kindness\r\n     towards me. Many of the gentlemen took the greatest\r\n     interest in my pursuits; one, Dr. ——, presented me with\r\n     an excellent New Foundland dog, and other valuable\r\n     memorials of his regard. Another, Dr. ——, gave me a\r\n     collection of shells, from the adjacent waters. The\r\n     ladies presented me with a capital supply of snuff.[7]\r\n     Desirous of going to Cole's Island, distant about 25\r\n     or 30 miles, to look after some marine birds, a boat,\r\n     four hands and a pilot, were immediately offered to me,\r\n     free of all expense, with the liberty to detain them as\r\n     long as was agreeable to me. It is not possible for me\r\n     to express properly the sense I feel of the kindness I\r\n     received from that warm-hearted and intelligent people.\r\n\r\n     And now, as you have good naturedly listened to what\r\n     I have felt bound to say on the score of gratitude, I\r\n     will tell you what I know you are impatient to come\r\n     to—something about my proceedings at Cole's Island.\r\n     It lies south from Charleston about 25 or 30 miles;\r\n     there we arrived and encamped for the night: certain\r\n     beef-steaks we brought with us we roasted upon sticks,\r\n     and the adjacent shore provided us with excellent\r\n     oysters: gaiety, good appetites, and our hearts all\r\n     right, made the time pass pleasantly, and it was with\r\n     some reluctance we spread our blankets, and arranged\r\n     the fire preparatory to going to rest. Nothing is\r\n     more valuable to a naturalist, and particularly to\r\n     an ornithologist, than the first hours of the day;\r\n     therefore, long ere the sun had glowed over the broad\r\n     sea that lay before our camp, we had reached another\r\n     island where birds resort to roost by thousands; but,\r\n     notwithstanding these multitudes, not a new species did\r\n     we procure. We, however, had the pleasure of observing\r\n     two noble \"birds of Washington,\"[8] sailing majestically\r\n     over the broad watery face.\r\n\r\n     But it was necessary to bring my stay in Charleston\r\n     to a close, and it was somewhat difficult too. My\r\n     friends had increased in number; they were in the habit\r\n     of accompanying me in my shooting excursions; I was\r\n     becoming very much attached to them; invitations poured\r\n     in from various parts of the country; and I really\r\n     believe that had I been willing, we might have remained\r\n     there and in the neighborhood, if not all our lives, at\r\n     least as long as would have caused a rare scarcity of\r\n     the feathered tribes, in that portion of the Carolinas.\r\n     But my mind was among the birds farther south,—the\r\n     Floridas, Red River, the Arkansas, that almost unknown\r\n     country, California, and the Pacific ocean. I felt\r\n     myself drawn to the untried scenes of those countries,\r\n     and it was necessary to tear myself away from the\r\n     kindest friends.\r\n\r\n     We embarked on the schooner Agnes; the wind was fair,\r\n     and we hoisted all sails for the Floridas. Our passage\r\n     was not short; the wind changed, and we put back into\r\n     St. Simon's Island Bay. This was one of the few put\r\n     backs in life of a fortunate kind for me. I made for the\r\n     shore, met a gentleman on the beach, presented him my\r\n     card, and was immediately invited to dinner. I visited\r\n     his gardens, got into such agreeable conversation and\r\n     quarters, that I was fain to think that I had landed on\r\n     some one of those fairy islands said to have existed\r\n     in the golden age. But this was not all; the owner of\r\n     this hospitable mansion pressed me to stay a month with\r\n     him, and subscribed to my Birds of America in the most\r\n     gentlemanly manner. This was T. B. K., Esq.[9] But the\r\n     wind shifted; I was sent for, and our voyage to St.\r\n     Augustine resumed.\r\n\r\n     St. Augustine, whatever it may have been, is far from\r\n     being a flourishing place now. It lies at the bottom of\r\n     a bay, extremely difficult of access, even for vessels\r\n     of light draft, which seldom reach the \"city\" in less\r\n     than a day. I cannot say much for the market, nor for\r\n     the circumjacent country. Oranges and plenty of good\r\n     fish seem to contribute the wealth of the place. Sands,\r\n     poor pine forests, and impenetrable thickets of cactus\r\n     and palmettos form the undergrowth. Birds are rare,\r\n     and very shy; and with all our exertions, we have not\r\n     collected one hundred skins in a fortnight that we have\r\n     been here. I have received many kind attentions, and\r\n     numerous invitations to visit plantations, on our way to\r\n     the south, where I shall direct my steps in a few days.\r\n     I have drawn seventeen species, among which one _mongrel\r\n     vulture_, which I think will prove new. You will see it,\r\n     I hope, very soon.\r\n\r\n     I will give you a sketch of our manner of passing the\r\n     time. We are up before day, and our toilette is soon\r\n     made. If the day is to be spent at drawing, Lehman and\r\n     I take a walk, and Ward, his gun, dog, and basket,\r\n     returning when hungry or fatigued, or both. We draw\r\n     uninterruptedly till dusk, after which, another walk,\r\n     then write up journals, and retire to rest early. When\r\n     we have nothing on hand to draw, the guns are cleaned\r\n     over night, a basket of bread and cheese, a bottle\r\n     with old whiskey, and some water, is prepared. We get\r\n     into a boat, and after an hour of hard rowing, we find\r\n     ourselves in the middle of most extensive marshes, as\r\n     far as the eye can reach. The boat is anchored, and\r\n     we go wading through mud and water, amid myriads of\r\n     sand-flies and mosquitoes, shooting here and there a\r\n     bird, or squatting down on our hams for half an hour,\r\n     to observe the ways of the beautiful beings we are\r\n     in pursuit of. This is the way in which we spend the\r\n     day. At the approach of evening, the cranes, herons,\r\n     pelicans, curlews, and the trains of blackbirds are\r\n     passing high over our heads, to their roosting places;\r\n     then we also return to ours. If some species are\r\n     to draw the next day, and the weather is warm, they\r\n     are _outlined_ that same evening, to save them from\r\n     incipient putridity. I have ascertained that _feathers_\r\n     lose their brilliancy almost as rapidly as flesh or\r\n     skin itself, and am of opinion that a bird alive is 75\r\n     per cent more rich in colours than twenty-four hours\r\n     after its death; we therefore skin those first which\r\n     have been first killed, and the same evening. All this,\r\n     added to our other avocations, brings us into the night\r\n     pretty well fatigued. Such, my dear friend, is the life\r\n     of an active naturalist; and such, in my opinion, it\r\n     ought to be. It is nonsense ever to hope to see in the\r\n     closet what is only to be perceived—as far as the laws,\r\n     arrangements and beauties of ornithological nature is\r\n     concerned,—by that devotion of time, opportunities, and\r\n     action, to which I have consecrated my life, not without\r\n     hope that science may benefit by my labours.\r\n\r\n     As to geology, my dear Friend, you know as well as\r\n     myself, that I am not in the country for that. The\r\n     instructions you gave me are very valuable, and I\r\n     shall be vigilant. The aspect of the country will soon\r\n     begin to change, and as I proceed, I will write to\r\n     you about all we see and do.... Do not be afraid of\r\n     my safety; I take a reasonable care of my health and\r\n     life. I know how to guard against real difficulties,\r\n     and I have no time to attend to that worst of all kinds\r\n     of difficulties,—imaginary ones. Circumstances never\r\n     within my control, threw me upon my own resources, at\r\n     a very early period of my life. I have grown up in the\r\n     school of adversity, and am not an unprofitable scholar\r\n     there, having learnt to be satisfied with providing\r\n     for my family and myself by my own exertions. The life\r\n     I lead is my vocation, full of smooth and rough paths,\r\n     like every vocation which men variously try. My physical\r\n     constitution has always been good, and the fine flow of\r\n     spirits I have, has often greatly assisted me in some of\r\n     the most trying passages of my life. I know I am engaged\r\n     in an arduous undertaking; but if I live to complete it,\r\n     I will offer to my country a beautiful monument of the\r\n     varied splendour of American nature, and of my devotion\r\n     to American ornithology.\r\n\r\n          JOHN JAMES AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n          Ther., this day, at 2 p. m.,\r\n          78° Fahr.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, December 8, 1831, Audubon sent the following\r\nrequest to Dr. Harlan of Philadelphia: \"I wish you also to send me—to\r\nKey West—, 20 more pounds of powdered arsenic from Friend Wetherell's\r\nshop,[10] and also a double barelled gun of usual length, as good\r\nas you can procure for 30 dollars; probably a second hand one may be\r\nprocured; it must be _percussion_ and, if possible, _back action_.\" Dr.\r\nRichard Harlan, who often transmitted to Mrs. Audubon any news which\r\ncame direct from her husband, wrote to her on December 10, 1831, as\r\nfollows:[11]\r\n\r\n     I have just recd a letter from Mr Aud—dated St.\r\n     Augustine Nov. 24th they enjoy health amidst their\r\n     fatiguing avocations—has obtained another subscriber,\r\n     living on St. Simons island named Tho. Butler King—to\r\n     whom I am to send the work as soon as the Copies\r\n     exported arrive from London—he has good expectations\r\n     of adding some new birds to his list—have you seen the\r\n     Sonnet addressed to Mr Aud. in the \"Wreath\" a London\r\n     annual for 1832?—under the signature of J. E. R?—our\r\n     newspapers announce the arrival, departure & progress of\r\n     Mr Audubon, as if he was an _Embassador_—and so he is,\r\n     one of Natures——\r\n\r\nThe winter season at St. Augustine proved unfavorable for the\r\nnaturalist's work, and he anxiously awaited the coming of the\r\ngovernment vessel, the _Spark_, to the commander of which he bore\r\nletters from Washington. After spending about three weeks in the\r\nneighborhood of the city, the party proceeded through the inlet\r\nwhich divides Anastasia Island from the mainland, to the plantation\r\nof General Hernandez, thirty-five miles distant, where they were\r\nentertained for ten days. On Christmas morning they set out afoot for\r\nthe plantation of John Bulow, of Bulowville, fifteen miles away. To\r\nfollow the naturalist's account:\r\n\r\n     A wagon was sent for our baggage and horses for\r\n     ourselves were offered at the same time, but it was not\r\n     my desire to give unnecessary trouble, and above all\r\n     upon an occasion when I was glad to see the country in\r\n     as much detail as possible, and anxious to avail myself\r\n     of every occasion to get new birds.\r\n\r\n     During the whole long stay with Mr. Bulow, there was no\r\n     abatement of his kindness, or his unremitted efforts\r\n     to make me comfortable, and to promote my researches.\r\n     I shall ever feel grateful to one of the most deserving\r\n     and generous of men.\r\n\r\nOn December 28 their host proposed that they should descend the Halifax\r\nRiver in search of new and valuable birds to a point about forty miles\r\nfrom that place and eighty miles from St. Augustine.[12]\r\n\r\n     Accordingly, the boat, six hands, and \"_three white\r\n     men_,\" with some provisions, put off with a fair wind,\r\n     and a pure sky.... We meandered down a creek for about\r\n     eleven miles—the water torpid yet clear—the shore lined\r\n     with thousands of acres covered by fall grapes, marshes,\r\n     and high palm trees, rendering the shore quite novel to\r\n     my anxious eye. Some birds were shot, and secured so as\r\n     to be brought back, in order to undergo the _skinning\r\n     operation_. Before long we entered the Halifax river,\r\n     an inland arm of the sea, measuring in breadth from a\r\n     quarter to nearly a mile.\r\n\r\nThey reached a spot, called \"Live Oak Landing,\" where a schooner from\r\nNew York was then anchored, and there passed the night.\r\n\r\n     At sunrise the next morning, I and four negro servants\r\n     proceeded in search of birds and adventures. The fact\r\n     is, that I was anxious to kill some 25 brown Pelicans\r\n     ... to enable me to make a new drawing of an adult\r\n     male bird, and to procure the dresses of the others. I\r\n     proceeded along a narrow, shallow bay, where the fish\r\n     were truly abundant. Would you believe it, if I were\r\n     to say, that the fish nearly obstructed our head-way?\r\n     Believe it, or not, so it was; the waters were filled\r\n     with them, large and small. I shot some rare birds,\r\n     and putting along the shore, passed a point, when lo, I\r\n     came in sight of several hundred pelicans, perched on\r\n     the branches of mangrove trees, seated in comfortable\r\n     harmony, as near each other as the strength of the\r\n     boughs would allow. I ordered to back water gently; the\r\n     hands backed water. I waded to the shore under cover\r\n     of the rushes along it, saw the pelecans fast asleep,\r\n     examined their countenances and deportment well and\r\n     leisurely, and after all, levelled, fired my piece, and\r\n     dropped two of the finest specimens I ever saw. I really\r\n     believe I would have shot one hundred of these reverend\r\n     sirs, had not a mistake taken place in the reloading\r\n     of my gun. A mistake, however, did take place, and to\r\n     my utmost disappointment, I saw each pelecan, old and\r\n     young, leave his perch, and take to wing, soaring off,\r\n     well pleased, I dare say, at making so good an escape\r\n     from so dangerous a foe.\r\n\r\nAfter shooting more birds, and pushing or pulling their boat \"over\r\noyster banks sharp as razors,\" they made the schooner at the landing\r\nagain. \"The birds, generally speaking,\" he continues, \"appeared wild\r\nand few—you must be aware that I call birds few, when I shoot less than\r\none hundred per day.\"\r\n\r\nSuch remarks as we have just quoted might convey the impression that\r\nthe American woodsman, with whose name the cause of bird protection is\r\nnow associated in this country, was a reckless destroyer of all bird\r\nlife, but this was far from the case. It must be remembered that this\r\nwas over eighty years ago, when the unrivaled abundance of our birds\r\nwas such that the necessity of their conservation had hardly entered\r\nthe dreams of the most discerning. Audubon no doubt had gradually\r\nyielded to the prevalent mania for describing and figuring new species,\r\nand to make out all the minute specific differences a large series\r\nof specimens was necessary; still more were needed for the detection\r\nof individual variation, which did not escape him, and much less his\r\nassistant, William MacGillivray, who demanded large numbers for his\r\nanatomical studies. Furthermore, Audubon counted upon defraying a part\r\nof his expenses by collections of skins of American birds, which were\r\nthen desiderata among the museums of Europe.[13]\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed that they should return,\r\n\r\n     preparations were accordingly made, and we left the\r\n     schooner, with tide and wind in our teeth, and with the\r\n     prospect of a severe, cold night. Our hands pulled well,\r\n     and our bark was as light as our hearts. All went on\r\n     merrily until dark night came on. The wind freshening,\r\n     the cold augmenting, the provisions diminishing,\r\n     the waters lowering, all—all depreciating except our\r\n     enterprising dispositions. We found ourselves fast in\r\n     the mud about 300 yards from a marshy shore, without\r\n     the least hope of being able to raise a fire, for\r\n     no trees except palm trees were near, and the _grand\r\n     diable_ himself could not burn one of them. Our minds\r\n     were soon made up to do—what? Why, to roll ourselves\r\n     in our cloaks, and lay down, the best way we could,\r\n     at the bottom of our light and beautiful barque. Good\r\n     God, what a night! To sleep was impossible; the cold\r\n     increased with the breeze, and every moment seemed an\r\n     hour, from the time we stretched ourselves down until\r\n     the first glimpse of the morn; but the morn came, clear\r\n     as ever morn was, and the north-easter as cold as ever\r\n     wind blew in this latitude. All hands half dead, and\r\n     masters as nearly exhausted as the hands—stiffened with\r\n     cold, light-clothed, and but slight hope of our nearing\r\n     any shore; our only resort was, to leap into the mire,\r\n     waste-deep, and to push the barque to a point, some\r\n     five hundred or six hundred yards, where a few scrubby\r\n     trees seem to have grown to save our lives on this\r\n     occasion. \"Push, boys, push! Push for your lives!\", cry\r\n     the generous Bulow, and the poor Audubon.—\"All hands\r\n     push!\" Aye and well might we push: the mire was up to\r\n     our breasts, our limbs becoming stiffened at every step\r\n     we took. Our progress was slowly performed as if we had\r\n     been clogged with heavy chains. It took us two and a\r\n     half hours to reach the point, where the few trees of\r\n     which I have spoken were; but, thank God, we did get\r\n     there.\r\n\r\n      _We landed_ ... and well it was that we did; for on\r\n     reaching the margin of the marsh, two of the negroes\r\n     fell down in the marsh, as senseless as torpidity ever\r\n     rendered an alligator, or a snake; and had we, _the\r\n     white men_, not been there, they certainly would have\r\n     died. We had carried them into the little grove, to\r\n     which, I believe, all of us owe our lives. I struck\r\n     a fire in a crack; and, in five minutes, I saw, with\r\n     indescribable pleasure, the bright, warming blaze in\r\n     a log pile in the center of our shivering party. We\r\n     wrapped the negroes in their blankets—boiled some water,\r\n     and soon had some tea—made them swallow it, and with\r\n     care revived them into animation. May God preserve\r\n     you from being ever in the condition of our party at\r\n     this juncture; scarcely a man able to stand, and the\r\n     cold wind blowing as keenly as ever. Our men, however,\r\n     gradually revived—the trees, one after another, fell\r\n     under the hatchet, and increased our fire—and in two\r\n     hours I had the pleasure of seeing cheerful faces again.\r\n\r\nTheir predicament, however, was still serious, for, to continue the\r\nnarrative, they were\r\n\r\n     confined in a large salt marsh, with rushes head high,\r\n     and miry; no provisions left, and fifteen miles from the\r\n     house of their host.\r\n\r\n     Not a moment was to be lost, for I foresaw that the next\r\n     night would prove much colder still. The boat was manned\r\n     once more, and off through the mud we moved to double\r\n     the point, and enter the creek, of which I have spoken,\r\n     with the hope that in it we should find water enough to\r\n     float her. It did happen so, thank God! As we once more\r\n     saw our barque afloat, our spirits rose,—and rose to\r\n     such a pitch that we in fun set fire to the whole marsh:\r\n     crack, crack, crack! went the reeds, with a rapid blaze.\r\n     We saw the marsh rabbits, scampering from the fire by\r\n     the thousands, as we pulled our oars.\r\n\r\nTheir pleasure in being afloat was short-lived, for \"the northeaster\r\nhad well nigh emptied the creek of its usual quantum of water,\" and\r\nthey were again obliged to wade to effect a landing, their object being\r\nto gain the east Florida coast and thus make their escape. This was\r\nfinally attained after abandoning their boat, when began a long tramp\r\non the beach, in the teeth of the wind,\r\n\r\n     through sand that sent our feet back six inches at\r\n     every step of two feet that we made. Well, through this\r\n     sand we all _waded_, for many a long mile, picking\r\n     up here and there a shell that is nowhere else to be\r\n     found, until we reached the landing place of J. J.\r\n     Bulow. Now, my heart, cheer up once more, for the sake\r\n     of my most kind host.... I assure you, I was glad to\r\n     see him nearing his own comfortable roof; and as we saw\r\n     the large house opening to view, across his immense\r\n     plantation, I anticipated a good dinner with as much\r\n     pleasure as I ever experienced.\r\n\r\n     All hands returned alive; refreshments and good care\r\n     have made us all well again, unless it be the stiffness\r\n     occasioned in my left leg, by nearly six weeks of daily\r\n     wading through swamps and salt marshes, or scrambling\r\n     through the vilest thickets of scrubly live oaks and\r\n     palmitoes that appear to have been created for no other\r\n     purpose but to punish us for our sins.\r\n\r\nReaders of the following account who have visited eastern Florida may\r\nconclude that Audubon was not a good prophet, but probably at that\r\nearly day no one could have made a better forecast of the future:\r\n\r\n     The land, if land it can be called, is generally so\r\n     very sandy that nothing can be raised upon it. The\r\n     swamps are the only spots that afford a fair chance\r\n     for cultivation; the swamps, then, are positively the\r\n     only places where plantations are to be found. These\r\n     plantations are even few in number; along the coast\r\n     from St. Augustine to Cape Carnaveral, there are about\r\n     a dozen. These, with the exception of two or three,\r\n     are yet young plantations. General Hernandez's, J. J.\r\n     Bulow's, and Mr. Durham's are the strongest, and perhaps\r\n     the best. Sugar cane will prosper, and doubtless do\r\n     well; but the labour necessary to produce a good crop,\r\n     is great! great!! great!!! Between the swamps of which\r\n     I now speak, and which are found along the margin laying\r\n     west of the sea inlet, that divides _the main land_ from\r\n     the Atlantic, to the river St. John of the interior of\r\n     the peninsula, nothing exists but barren pine lands of\r\n     poor timber, and immense savannas, mostly overflowed,\r\n     and all unfit for cultivation. That growth, which in\r\n     any other country is called underwood, scarcely exists;\r\n     the land being covered with low palmitoes, or very low,\r\n     thickly branched dwarf oaks, almost impenetrable to man.\r\n     The climate is of a most unsettled nature, at least at\r\n     this season. The thermometer has made leaps from 30\r\n     to 89 degrees in 24 hours, cold, warm, sandy, muddy,\r\n     watery,—all these varieties may be seen in one day's\r\n     travelling.... Game and fish, it is true, are abundant;\r\n     but the body of valuable tillable land is too small to\r\n     enable the peninsula ever to become a rich state.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EARLY UNPUBLISHED DRAWING IN WATER-COLOR OF THE\r\n    CAROLINA PARROT, ON BRANCH OF THE HICKORY, DATED \"HENDERSON, JUNE\r\n    9TH, 1811.\" THE ORIGINAL BEARS THE NOTE: \"POOR IMITATION OF COLOR,\r\n    THE NATURAL BIRD BEING EXTREMELY GLOSSY AND RICH.\"\r\n\r\n    Published by courtesy of Mr. Joseph Y. Jeanes.]\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 1832, the party started to visit a famous spring near\r\nthe sources of the St. John's River, which was described in his third\r\nletter to Featherstonhaugh as well as in a later \"Episode.\"[14] There\r\nhis host, Colonel Rees, who utilized the abundant flow from this\r\ncurious spring for grinding the whole of his sugar cane, took them\r\ndown the Spring Garden Creek to a series of muddy lakes which emptied\r\ninto the St. John's. The mud on this occasion was the cause of great\r\ndisappointment to the naturalist, for it made it impossible for him to\r\nrecover what he believed to represent a new species of Ibis, which was\r\nshot in one of those bottomless pits. \"Being only a few yards distant\r\nfrom us,\" to quote from Audubon's third letter,[15] \"and quite near\r\nenough to ascertain the extent of my loss, I submitted to lose a fine\r\npair of a new species, the which if I ever fall in with it again, I\r\nshall call _Tantalus fuscus_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the borders of Woodruff's Lake, after noon,\r\nfatigued and hungry, he continued:\r\n\r\n     We landed on a small island of a few acres, covered\r\n     with a grove of sour orange trees, intermixed with not\r\n     a few live oaks. The oranges were in great profusion\r\n     on the trees—everything about us was calm and beautiful\r\n     and motionless, as if it had just come from the hand of\r\n     the Creator. It would have been a perfect Paradise for a\r\n     poet, but I was not fit to be in Paradise; the loss of\r\n     my ibis made me as sour as the oranges that hung about\r\n     me. I felt unquiet, too, in this singular scene, as if I\r\n     were almost upon the verge of creation, where realities\r\n     were tapering off into nothing. The general wildness the\r\n     eternal labyrinths of waters and marshes, interlocked,\r\n     and apparently never ending; the whole surrounded by\r\n     interminable swamps—all these things had a tendency\r\n     to depress my spirits, notwithstanding some beautiful\r\n     flowers, rich looking fruits, a pure sky, and ample\r\n     sheets of water at my feet. Here I am in the Floridas,\r\n     thought I, a country that received its name from the\r\n     odours wafted from the orange groves, to the boats of\r\n     the first discoverers, and which from my childhood I\r\n     have consecrated in my imagination as the garden of the\r\n     United States. A garden, where all that is not mud, mud,\r\n     mud, is sand, sand, sand; where the fruit is so sour\r\n     that it is not eatable, and where in place of singing\r\n     birds and golden fishes, you have a species of ibis that\r\n     you cannot get when you have shot it, and alligators,\r\n     snakes, and scorpions.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Bartram was the first to call this a garden, but\r\n     he is to be forgiven; he was an enthusiastic botanist,\r\n     and rare plants, in the eyes of such a man, convert a\r\n     wilderness at once into a garden.\r\n\r\n     When we had eaten our humble repast at the sweet little\r\n     Orange Grove Island, we left it \"alone with its glory,\"\r\n     but not without a name. It was determined, nolens\r\n     volens, that it should be called Audubon's Island, on\r\n     the St. John's river. Lat. 29° 42´.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, 1832, Lieutenant Piercy took Audubon and his\r\nassistants aboard the government schooner _Spark_ at St. Augustine,\r\nand sailed for the mouth of the St. John's River, which he had orders\r\nto ascend in the interests of the Revenue Service. On February 12,\r\nwhen they had reached a point one hundred miles from the mouth of the\r\nriver, the vessel, being in need of repairs, was suddenly recalled.\r\nAudubon, with two men, thereupon engaged a boat and attempted to return\r\nto St. Augustine across country, by a short cut to the eastward. They\r\nwere soon stranded and the party divided. Audubon with his dog and\r\none companion then endeavored to make their way by land to the town,\r\neighteen miles distant, but they were overtaken by a terrific gale and\r\nthunder-storm, and in order to keep to the trails were often obliged to\r\ngrope their way on hands and knees.[16]\r\n\r\nAt about this time the publishers of the _Journal of Geology\r\nand Natural Science_, from which we have quoted, failed, and\r\nFeatherstonhaugh, who assumed their debts to all subscribers, was\r\nobliged to bring it to a close with the completion of the first volume;\r\nAudubon's third and last letter appeared in the valedictory number for\r\nJune, 1832.\r\n\r\nAgain the naturalist applied to the government officials at Washington\r\nfor assistance, and, as the following letter shows, Edward Everett\r\nagain came to his aid, as did also Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the\r\nNavy, to whom Audubon later received a personal introduction from Chief\r\nJustice Taney of the Supreme Court:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Levi Woodbury to Louis McLane_\r\n\r\n          NAVY DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n          _February 24 1832_\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     The letter of the Honorable Mr. Everett of the 18th.\r\n     inst. relating to Mr. Audubon &c and referred by you to\r\n     this Department, has been received.\r\n\r\n     I regret that the impaired condition of the Spark made\r\n     it necessary some weeks ago, to order that vessel to\r\n     Norfolk to be refitted.\r\n\r\n     I have heretofore taken much pleasure in furnishing Mr.\r\n     Audubon with credentials to the officers of the Navy,\r\n     and requesting [them] to furnish every aid, in the\r\n     prosecution of [his] scientific researches: and shall be\r\n     happy to afford any further facilities within the power\r\n     of the Department.\r\n\r\n          I am very respectfully\r\n          &c &c\r\n\r\n          LEVI WOODBURY\r\n\r\n     HONORABLE. L. MC LANE\r\n     Secy of the Treasury\r\n\r\nFinally, on April 15, 1832, Audubon and his party were able to\r\nboard the revenue cutter _Marion_, commanded by Robert Day, and the\r\nopportunity thus afforded for exploring the dangerous east Florida\r\ncoast amply repaid them for their long and vexatious delays. They\r\nvisited the islands from St. Augustine to Key West, and examined every\r\npart of the shore which it was the duty of the _Marion_ to approach.\r\nAt Indian Key the deputy collector, Mr. Thurston, gave Audubon the\r\nservices of his pilot, a veteran sailor and hunter, who accompanied\r\nhim on the _Marion_ for a number of weeks and led many boat journeys\r\nto lonely islands, where vast colonies of sea fowl then dwelt in\r\nundisputed possession. The leisurely movements of the vessel also\r\nenabled the naturalist to produce many finished drawings, and to obtain\r\nmaterials for fresh \"Episodes.\"[17] At Key West Audubon was hospitably\r\nreceived by Major Classel,[18] and by Dr. Strobel, who was of great\r\nassistance both to him and to Bachman in procuring new birds from that\r\nlittle known point.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected delays experienced in Florida, and the expense\r\nwhich the presence of his assistants necessarily entailed, in all\r\nprobability, deterred the naturalist from the more hazardous and\r\nuncertain enterprise of attempting to reach the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe Pacific Coast, which for years had been the great object of his\r\nambition. At all events, after their work was finished at Key West,\r\nthe party returned to St. Augustine, and on the fifth day of March\r\nagain boarded the packet schooner _Agnes_, which was to bear them with\r\ntheir collections to Charleston. Audubon, however, left the vessel at\r\nSavannah, in order to deliver letters from the Rathbones of Liverpool\r\nto a number of their rich merchant friends in the former city. One of\r\nthese, named William Gaston,[19] at first declined to subscribe to _The\r\nBirds of America_, on the ground of its great expense and the demands\r\nmade upon his purse by charity, but his indifference was quickly\r\novercome: not only did he write his name on Audubon's list, but he\r\nimmediately went out and obtained three other subscribers; he even\r\ninsisted on becoming Audubon's agent at Savannah, and saw to it that\r\nnone of those subscriptions was ever allowed to lapse in after years.\r\nSavannah eventually gave him six subscribers, which was more than were\r\ncredited to either Philadelphia or Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAt Charleston the party disbanded. Lehman returned to Philadelphia,\r\nwhither Audubon later followed him, but Henry Ward obtained a position\r\nwith the Museum of Natural History, in which Bachman was interested,\r\nand he appears to have been of much assistance both to Bachman and to\r\nhis friend in procuring for them specimens of new or desirable birds\r\nand mammals; at a later day, however, he seems to have fallen into\r\ndisesteem on account of unpaid debts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nEASTERN VISIT AND EXPLORATIONS IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC\r\n\r\n     Bachman's success as a canvasser—Boston visit—Journey to\r\n     Portland—Ascent of the St. John's—Return overland—Victor\r\n     Audubon becomes his father's agent—Winter in Boston—The\r\n     Golden Eagle—Stricken with illness—Expedition to\r\n     Labrador planned—American support—Sails from Eastport\r\n     with five assistants—Discoveries and adventures on the\r\n     Labrador—Safe return—Another winter at Charleston—Sued\r\n     for old debts—Experience with vultures—Advice and\r\n     instruction to a son—Working habits—Return to England.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoiled in his attempt to see the Florida coast at the season best\r\nsuited to his purposes, and disappointed in his ambition to penetrate\r\nto the Far West, Audubon now turned his attention to the East and\r\ndetermined to follow the migratory birds to their summer homes in the\r\nNorth Atlantic. He left Charleston in early June, 1832, and went to\r\nPhiladelphia,[20] where he remained about a month, waiting, it seems,\r\nfor his wife and two sons to join him. In a letter to Edward Harris,\r\ndated at Philadelphia, June 9, 1832, he said that he had left the\r\n\"National hotel, on account of the too high price, I found I would\r\nhave to pay there, and removed to Camden, at a Mr. Armstrong's, where\r\nI formerly boarded\"; he asked Harris to send him \"a pair of fine\r\nwoodchucks,\" as he wished to secure a drawing of those animals.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that while Audubon had been absent in\r\nFlorida, his friend Bachman had busied himself in his behalf and\r\neventually succeeded in placing three copies of _The Birds of America_\r\nin public institutions in Charleston. On December 23, 1831, he wrote to\r\nAudubon, who was then at St. Augustine:\r\n\r\n     I arrived in Columbia, S. C., almost too late, for the\r\n     \"House\" had just resolved that the State was too poor\r\n     to subscribe for Audubon's work. I felt that it would\r\n     be a disgrace to the State; and, for the first time in\r\n     my life, I turned to electioneering. And now, behold\r\n     me among the back countrymen, spinning long yarns. The\r\n     thing however, took, and your book is subscribed for....\r\n     I read what was said in your favor with regard to the\r\n     \"Rattlesnake Story,\" and thus far, they have not found\r\n     a wrong twist in your yarn; but be careful in describing\r\n     the wonders of the South and West.\r\n\r\nAudubon wrote to Bachman from Philadelphia, July 1, 1832: \"G. Ord has\r\ncaused a most violent attack on my veracity to be inserted in a London\r\njournal; how will he stand _mine eye_, on Tuesday next at the Society,\r\nis more than I can at present tell.... Mr. Berthoud will ship you 3\r\nvolumes of the Birds of America, and the succeeding numbers; he will\r\nsend a bill of sale of those.\"\r\n\r\nHis plan was now to visit Boston and Maine, and he left Philadelphia\r\nwith his family in early August; they traveled by stage to New York,\r\nbut upon finding that the city was then suffering from a periodic\r\nscourge of the cholera, tarried but a day and hastened on. The\r\nfollowing letter which Richard Harlan sent after his friend in August\r\nof this year shows that his own city did not escape the pest:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard Harlan to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          [Addressed] J.

So warmly was he then welcomed by the leading public\r\nand professional men of the city that he could never say enough in\r\npraise of the Bostonians. Dr. George Parkman, Dr. George C. Shattuck,\r\nand Col. Thomas H. Perkins,[21] who was already one of his subscribers,\r\nwere among his most enthusiastic supporters. Of Parkman Audubon said:\r\n\"He it is, whose memory is most dear to me.\" It was doubtless Parkman,\r\nthen a professor in the Medical School, who introduced Audubon to the\r\npresident of Harvard University, Josiah Quincy, whose name was added to\r\nhis list.\r\n\r\nOn August 14, shortly after reaching Boston, Audubon wrote to his\r\nfriend Harris:\r\n\r\n     We left Camden, pushed by the season, and the desire\r\n     I have to fulfil towards my subscribers, the world,\r\n     and indeed myself, the task allotted me by nature,—the\r\n     completion of my work.... Allow me to say that with\r\n     my work, as in the days of '76, the Bostonians have\r\n     proved themselves the best supporters of a good cause\r\n     in the country. We expect the support of the Cambridge\r\n     University, that of the Natural History Society, & again\r\n     of the State! (Pray remember how anxious we are to have\r\n     all the States.)\r\n\r\n     I made drawings of 3 rare species; one is the Marsh\r\n     Wren, for which I searched in vain when near Salem; the\r\n     2d. is a Fly-catcher, described by Mr. Nuttall, and the\r\n     last a Thrush.\r\n\r\n     We leave tomorrow for Portland, in Maine, through which\r\n     we will merely pass, and ere one week expires, expect to\r\n     be at the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nThe Audubon family now traveled by carriage and mail-coach along the\r\nentire coast of Maine, but made no prolonged stay until they reached\r\nEastport, where excursions were taken into the surrounding country,\r\nand the woods and shores were thoroughly ransacked. At Dennisville\r\nthey made the acquaintance of Judge Lincoln's family, which rendered\r\ntheir stay of a number of weeks \"exceedingly agreeable\"; as will appear\r\nlater,[22] it was this agreeable family that furnished Audubon with\r\na valuable recruit for his expedition to Labrador. Towards the end of\r\nSeptember they entered New Brunswick and began to ascend the St. John's\r\nRiver. A week was passed at Fredericton, where they were hospitably\r\nreceived by Sir Archibald Campbell. Thence they continued in a small\r\nboat, which was towed upstream by mules, to Woodstock, Maine. There\r\na cart was procured, in which they proceeded overland to Houlton,\r\nin Aroostook County, then \"A neat village, consisting of some fifty\r\nhouses,\" and after a few days passed at this garrison town in looking\r\nfor new birds, they started for Bangor, following the old military road\r\nwhich led along the Penobscot River to Old Town. Said the ornithologist\r\nof this journey:\r\n\r\n     Autumn, with her mellow tints, her glowing fruits, and\r\n     her rich fields of corn, smiled in placid beauty. Many\r\n     of the fields had not been reaped; the fruits of the\r\n     forests and orchards hung clustering around us, and\r\n     as we came in view of the Penebscot river, our hearts\r\n     thrilled with joy....\r\n\r\n     The road which we followed from Old Town to Bangor was\r\n     literally covered with Penobscot Indians, returning from\r\n     market. On reaching the latter beautiful town, we found\r\n     very comfortable lodgings in an excellent hotel; and the\r\n     next day we proceeded by the mail to Boston.[23]\r\n\r\nAudubon felt that he ought to remain in America for at least another\r\nyear, and decided to send his son, Victor, to England to take charge\r\nof his publication. This work had now become a paramount family\r\ninterest, and for the nineteen years of life that remained to the\r\nelder Audubon, his two sons virtually became his assistants, John as an\r\nactive collector and companion in the field, and Victor as his business\r\nagent and secretary. In writing again to Edward Harris, from Boston,\r\nNovember 1, 1832, Audubon noted that they had found the Canada Grouse\r\nin abundance, and that he was assured of its breeding commonly within\r\nthe Union; Victor, he added, had sailed to England, \"on the tenth of\r\nlast month\" on the packet ship _South America_.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1832 and the following winter were spent in Boston, where\r\nthe naturalist was busily engaged in drawing and in laying plans for\r\nthe now famous expedition to the coast of Labrador. Meantime Bachman,\r\nwho was keenly interested in his success, was urging him to return to\r\nCharleston; on October 20, 1832, he wrote: \"A month in your society\r\nwould afford me greater pleasure than the highest prize in a lottery. I\r\ncannot, I find, feel myself at home with new birds without having the\r\nskins to refer to. My cabinet is enlarging every day. Henry Ward now\r\nprepares the skins—a pair of each.... What ducks, that are not likely\r\nto be obtained for you in Boston, would you like Maria to draw for\r\nyou?\" Writing again on the 26th of October, he said:[24]\r\n\r\n     I wish to know what you are doing—what progress your\r\n     work is making; and, whilst I feel deeply interested\r\n     for your fame ... I feel also a particular interest\r\n     in your personal welfare, and that of all that\r\n     belongs to you;... Besides, I want to see you once\r\n     more to ascertain whether you have stuck to your good\r\n     resolutions, viz., never to swear (which is a vulgar\r\n     practice for one who is conversant with the most\r\n     beautiful of God's works, the feathered race), and\r\n     never to work on Sundays. However, you are now under\r\n     the tutorage of your good wife, and, I doubt not, you\r\n     are as obedient to her in these things, as you ought to\r\n     be.... You say new birds are scarce. So they are, and\r\n     yet, in my opinion, we will occasionally find them for\r\n     half a century to come. (November 11) Maria has figured\r\n     for you the \"White Hibiscus,\" and, also, a red one, both\r\n     natives and beautiful; a Euonymus in seed, in which\r\n     our Sylvia is placed; the white Nondescript Rose; the\r\n     Gordonica, a Begonia.... She is prepared to send them\r\n     to you; shall she ship them at once to Boston?... Your\r\n     resolution to publish the 3rd. Vol. of Water Birds, you\r\n     will recollect was partly entered into here, and from\r\n     that moment, my mind was at ease. It will give you four\r\n     or five years in advance, and will enable you, in a 5th.\r\n     Vol., to add all recent discoveries of Land and Water\r\n     Birds. Should you yet be able to go to Florida and the\r\n     Pacific, I apprehend that you will extend our American\r\n     Ornithology to 460 or 470 species, perhaps more. Your\r\n     sons being able to skin birds and paint them, is a great\r\n     desideratum; it should be mentioned in the preface to\r\n     your next volume. The talents of the family combined\r\n     ... will now place the work beyond the fear of falling\r\n     through, even in case of your death, and the public\r\n     ought to know it. But you must push for subscribers. If\r\n     your son Victor can do nothing in Europe, you must go\r\n     there yourself, and sooner than let the work suffer,\r\n     you must go on a pilgrimage throughout all the great\r\n     cities of our Union. Should God spare your life, I want\r\n     to hear of you enjoying, in your old age \"_Otium cum\r\n     dignitate_,\" and to see your children reaping some of\r\n     your recompense.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JOHN BACHMAN\r\n\r\n    AFTER A RARE ENGRAVING BY CHARLES C.

You\r\n     give no account of that of The _Bartram Sandpiper_\r\n     and of The _Spotted Sandpiper_—; probably they have\r\n     escaped you—let me know so that I may renew these should\r\n     they be missing—, but I think my Friend Children has\r\n     them—enquire—\r\n\r\n     The Charlotte is not yet in.

HAVELL, Esqr.,\r\n          Engraver,\r\n          77 Oxford Street,\r\n          London.\r\n\r\nWhile at Boston in the winter of 1833, Audubon obtained from the\r\nproprietor of the New England Museum, in Court Street, a superb\r\nspecimen of the Golden Eagle, which had been caught in the White\r\nMountains in a trap set for foxes. Possessed with a desire to depict\r\nthis noble bird, he worked so hard at the drawing that, as he said,\r\nit nearly cost him his life; he was suddenly seized with \"a spasmodic\r\naffection,\" which prostrated him for a time and greatly alarmed his\r\nfamily, but thanks to a strong constitution and to the aid of his\r\nmedical friends, Doctors Parkman, Warren and Shattuck, the crisis was\r\naverted, and he was soon able to continue his labors. \"The drawing of\r\nthis Eagle,\" said the naturalist, \"took me fourteen days, and I had\r\nnever before laboured so incessantly excepting at that of the Wild\r\nTurkey.\" He was at work on this painting when the following letter[26]\r\nwas dispatched to his eldest son:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to his Son, Victor_\r\n\r\n          BOSTON.\r\n          _Feb. 5th 1833._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIENDS\r\n\r\n     I am just now quite fatigued by the drawing of a Golden\r\n     Eagle which although it will make a splendid plate\r\n     has cost me sixty hours of the severest labor I have\r\n     experienced since I drew the Wild Turkey. You shall I\r\n     hope see it through the care of Mr. Gordon.[27] Do not\r\n     ever ship any more Nos. to this port unless on vessels\r\n     that are intended as packets. The Charlotte has not\r\n     come and it will be a rubber if I can get enough cash\r\n     to establish our going to Labrador until she does.\r\n     Push Jos. B. Kidd of Edinburgh if he _can_ be pushed to\r\n     paint copies of our drawings. I look on that series as\r\n     of great importance to us all. Havell's blunder in not\r\n     having the numbers and paper on board the New York in\r\n     time, is one which, with him I can never correct. If\r\n     you can do more than I on this score of punctuality I\r\n     will be gratified. I shall proceed to New York as soon\r\n     as the weather moderates, on Sunday last the thermom.\r\n     was 12 below zero. The work is now I am assured free of\r\n     duty. When you write give a word of recollection to Dr.\r\n     Parkman who is a most desirable and worthy friend.\r\n\r\n          God bless you, forever yours\r\n\r\n          J. J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1833 Audubon was determined to carry out a long\r\ncherished desire to explore the coast of Labrador, where he hoped\r\nnot only to discover many new birds, but to ascertain the summer\r\nplumages and breeding habits of a host of water fowl that were known\r\nto resort in the milder season to that stern and rock-bound shore.\r\nAccordingly, he set about with characteristic energy to organize and\r\nfinance an expedition upon his own responsibility. The number of his\r\nAmerican subscribers was steadily increasing, and at that moment he\r\nfelt a degree of confidence in the future of his work to hazard almost\r\nany undertaking. In April, when his plans were fixed, he went to New\r\nYork to consult with his wife's brother-in-law and agent, Nicholas\r\nA. Berthoud, and to settle his business affairs before leaving the\r\ncountry. While there he wrote the following long letter[28] to his son,\r\nVictor, filled, as usual, with careful instructions and interesting\r\npersonal details. It will be noticed that when he took pen in hand the\r\nnumber of his American subscribers stood at 51, but before he laid it\r\ndown it had risen to 54; his belief that his efforts in the cause of\r\nnatural science would receive a hearty response in his own country was\r\nfully justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to his Son, Victor_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK _April 28th 1833_—\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR VICTOR—\r\n\r\n     On opening the box containing the numbers last sent to\r\n     this place for distribution, we found the contents Wet\r\n     and of course some of them damaged. We have however\r\n     dried them and made of them that could be done and\r\n     they will all go on Monday (tomorrow) to their Several\r\n     destinations—In future I recommend that Each parcel of\r\n     numbers for the different individuals are rolled up in\r\n     separate Parcel, inclosed in good stout brown Paper, and\r\n     each directed outside, enumerating the numbers therein\r\n     contained—then put all the Rolls in a Box—in this manner\r\n     they all will be less liable to Injury, will not need\r\n     to be undone here for we have no trouble at all at\r\n     the Custom House, and it will Save the handling of the\r\n     Plates at the Compting House.—\r\n\r\n     N.

AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nAudubon was particularly anxious to enlist a number of enthusiastic\r\nyoung men in the Labrador enterprise, and had hoped that his friend,\r\nEdward Harris, would join the party. Upon his return to Boston he\r\nstarted at once for Eastport, Maine, where he expected to charter\r\na vessel and complete his preparations. On May 9, 1833, he wrote to\r\nHarris from that point:\r\n\r\n     The more I approach the desired object of this voyage,\r\n     the more bouyant my spirits, and the greater my hopes\r\n     that when I return I will bring a cargo (not of codfish)\r\n     but of most valuable information. Make up your mind;\r\n     shoulder your firelock, and away to the fields where\r\n     science awaits us with ample stores, the contents of\r\n     which are the rarest materials ever employed by nature.\r\n\r\nTo this friend he wrote again from Eastport on the 14th of the same\r\nmonth:\r\n\r\n     As to my making use of your name in my letterpress, I\r\n     shall act as you desire, and yet I hope and fully expect\r\n     no denial on your part, on such occasions as will grant\r\n     me the pleasure of giving public notice of the treatment\r\n     I have received from you. I owe such a thing to you as\r\n     a trifling, very trifling, mark of my gratitude towards\r\n     one, whom I shall never cease to admire and esteem.\r\n\r\nThe _National Gazette_ of Philadelphia for May 2, 1833, devoted an\r\neditorial to Audubon and his prospective Labrador journey, in which\r\nthe writer said: \"We wish him a degree of success and prolongation of\r\nvigor equal to his great merits: indeed, for the past at least, success\r\nis fully assured.\" He added that between fifty and sixty subscribers\r\nto _The Birds of America_ had then been obtained in the United States;\r\nBoston had furnished eighteen; New York, eleven; Philadelphia, four;\r\nBaltimore, eight; Savannah, seven; Louisville, two, and New Orleans,\r\nthree; moreover, the legislatures of Massachusetts, New York, Maryland\r\nand South Carolina and the Congressional Library were subscribers for\r\none copy each. The writer continued:\r\n\r\n     A contribution to Mr. Audubon equal at least to that of\r\n     Boston or New York, would seem due from Philadelphia.\r\n     The subscription price may be considered as large ($\r\n     1,000), but how rich, ornamental, instructive, and\r\n     entertaining is the work, and how much preferable to the\r\n     merely personal gewgaws or transitory gratifications,\r\n     upon which greater sums are as frequently expended!\r\n     There are few minds of any refinement or elevation, to\r\n     which an act that rewards genius and fosters science,\r\n     would not yield higher and more durable pleasure than\r\n     any ordinary luxury.\r\n\r\n     We learn that Mr. Audubon will return to the United\r\n     States next autumn, and make a short sojourn before his\r\n     embarkation for Europe. Eight or nine more years, it is\r\n     supposed, will yet be necessary for the consummation of\r\n     his grand design. His constitution appears to be still\r\n     vigorous; his zeal is unabated; his powers of graphic\r\n     delineation have suffered no decay; we may, therefore,\r\n     expect that he will realize all his own laudatory hopes\r\n     and projects, and in so doing confer new obligations on\r\n     the votaries of natural history, and reflect additional\r\n     honor on his country.\r\n\r\nWhile Audubon was still at Eastport, and looking anxiously for\r\nyoung recruits, the following letter was received from Dr. George\r\nParkman:[30]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dr. George Parkman to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          BOSTON, _May 25th. 1833_.\r\n\r\n          J. J. AUDUBON Esqr.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR\r\n\r\n     Through the unceasing & active good-will of our Friend,\r\n     Dr. Shattuck, I present to you Mr. Ingalls, son of Dr.\r\n     Ingalls, one of our senior physicians & an experienced\r\n     public teacher of Anat.y & Surg.y—\r\n\r\n     The son is the father's pupil; & we have reason to\r\n     expect that he will prove a satisfactory disciple to\r\n     you.\r\n\r\n     The enclosed I claim for you the right to read, & for\r\n     myself to repossess, when we meet again.\r\n\r\n          respectfully\r\n\r\n          G. PARKMAN.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LETTER OF DR. GEORGE PARKMAN TO AUDUBON, MAY 25, 1833.\r\n\r\n    From the Howland MSS.]\r\n\r\nEdward Harris was unable to accompany his friend, and the four young\r\nmen eventually chosen were Joseph Coolidge,[31] William Ingalls, of\r\nBoston, Thomas Lincoln, of Dennisville, Maine, and George Cheyne\r\nShattuck,[32] the son of Dr. George C. Shattuck of Boston; these,\r\nwith John Woodhouse Audubon and the naturalist, made up the party. The\r\nschooner _Ripley_, a staunch new vessel of 106 tons, was chartered at\r\nEastport, and the expedition was ready to start by the latter part of\r\nMay. During his stay at Eastport Audubon visited Grand Manan Island,\r\na favorite resort for sea birds in the Bay of Fundy, and cruised about\r\nthe coast in a revenue cutter. On May 31, he wrote to Victor:[33]\r\n\r\n     I have been working hard at the Birds from Grand Menan,\r\n     as well as John, who is overcoming his habit of sleeping\r\n     late, as I call him every morning at four, and we have\r\n     famous long days....\r\n\r\n     The hull of the vessel has been floored, and our great\r\n     table solidly fixed in a tolerably good light under\r\n     the main hatch; it is my intention to draw whenever\r\n     possible, and that will be many hours, for the daylight\r\n     is with us nearly all the time in those latitudes, and\r\n     the fishermen say you can do with little sleep, the air\r\n     is so pure.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated delays the _Ripley_ sailed from Eastport for Labrador\r\non June 6, 1833, and the journey proved arduous and hazardous enough.\r\nAlthough disappointing in respect to the number of new species of\r\nbirds discovered, Audubon's visit was well timed; he was aided by a\r\nband of devoted and energetic youth, and they spent two months on the\r\ncoast of a wild country, then but little known save to a nefarious\r\ncrew of egg robbers and a few enterprising fishermen. His published\r\njournal of the voyage shows that he worked to the full limit of his\r\nphysical powers in studying and portraying the wonderful bird life\r\nwhich the party encountered. Despite the miseries of seasickness, an\r\nincompetent pilot, tempestuous weather, and the cramped quarters of\r\na small schooner, where all his drawings had to be done under an open\r\nhatch, he accomplished wonders, considering the shortness of his stay.\r\nBy rising at three o'clock in the morning and working for seventeen\r\nhours, he succeeded in completing many large drawings of birds, as well\r\nas studies of characteristic flowers; he also journalized voluminously\r\nand saw much of the coast and its adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nFrom Eastport they passed through the Gut of Canso and steered for the\r\nMagdalen Islands, where they landed and made collections. On June 14\r\nthey approached the famous Bird Rock, which at a distance seemed to be\r\ncovered with a mantle of new-fallen snow, an illusion soon dispelled\r\nas their vessel bore them nearer and a vast concourse of Gannets rose\r\nin great clouds from the rock; \"all stood astonished and amazed,\" said\r\nAudubon, and he felt that such a sight had of itself fully repaid them\r\nfor their journey. On June 17, the twelfth day out from Eastport, they\r\npassed Anticosti Island, and soon began to see what appeared like white\r\nsails on the horizon; these proved to be snow drifts on the Labrador,\r\nand on the 18th they landed at the mouth of the Natashquan River.\r\nDucks, Geese, Auks and Guillemots were there in great multitudes, as\r\nwell as Gulls and Terns; many were breeding, and all seemed wilder than\r\nat points farther south, a circumstance which was explained as soon as\r\nthey discovered the astounding proportions which the traffic in eggs of\r\nsea fowl had attained even at that time.[34]\r\n\r\nOn June 27 they procured a new bird[35] which Audubon named after\r\nhis young companion, Thomas Lincoln of Dennisville, Maine, and which\r\nis still known as \"Lincoln's Finch.\" This reference is found in his\r\njournal for the 4th of July: \"I have drawn all day, and have finished\r\nthe plate of the Fringilla lincolnii, to which I have put three plants\r\nof the country; to us they are very fitting to the purpose, for Lincoln\r\ngathered them.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Ripley_ left its anchorage at American Harbor or Natashquan\r\non June 28, and stood out to sea, their usual recourse to avoid\r\nthe intricacies of the coast. After proceeding fifty miles or more\r\nthey touched at numerous islands, where Guillemots, Puffins, and\r\nBlack-backed Gulls were breeding in vast numbers, and managed to anchor\r\nsafely, in spite of that \"ignorant ass\" of a pilot, at a wild and\r\ndesolate point which a recent traveler has identified as the harbor of\r\nWapitagun.[36] July the second was such a beautiful day for Labrador\r\nthat Audubon went on shore, where he drew this vivid picture of that\r\ndesolate land in sunshine:[37]\r\n\r\n     The country, so wild and grand, is of itself enough to\r\n     interest any one in its wonderful dreariness. Its mossy,\r\n     gray-clothed rocks, heaped and thrown together as if\r\n     by chance, in the most fantastical groups imaginable,\r\n     huge masses hanging on minor ones as if about to roll\r\n     themselves down from their doubtful-looking situations,\r\n     into the depths of the sea beneath. Bays without end,\r\n     sprinkled with rocky islands of all shapes and sizes,\r\n     where in every fissure a Guillemot, a Cormorant, or some\r\n     other wild bird retreats to secure its egg, and raise\r\n     its young, or save itself from the hunter's pursuit.\r\n     The peculiar cast of the sky, which never seems to be\r\n     certain, butterflies flitting over snow-banks, probing\r\n     beautiful dwarf flowerets of many hues [that are]\r\n     pushing their tender stems from the thick bed of moss\r\n     which everywhere covers the granite rocks. Then the\r\n     morasses, wherein you plunge up to your knees, or the\r\n     walking over the stubborn, dwarfish shrubbery, making\r\n     one think that as he goes he treads down the _forests_\r\n     of Labrador. The unexpected Bunting, or perhaps Sylvia,\r\n     which perchance, and indeed as if by chance alone, you\r\n     now and then see flying before you, or hear singing\r\n     from the creeping plants of the ground. The beautiful\r\n     fresh water lakes, on the ragged crests of greatly\r\n     elevated islands, wherein the Red and Black-necked\r\n     Divers swim as proudly as swans do in other latitudes,\r\n     and where the fish appear to have been cast as strayed\r\n     beings from the surplus food of the ocean. All—all is\r\n     wonderfully grand, wild—aye, and terrific. And yet how\r\n     beautiful it is now, when one sees the wild bee, moving\r\n     from one flower to another in search of food, which\r\n     doubtless is as sweet to it, as the essence of the\r\n     magnolia is to those of favored Louisiana. The little\r\n     Ring Plover rearing its delicate and tender young, the\r\n     Eider Duck swimming man-of-war-like amid her floating\r\n     brood, like the guardship of a most valuable convoy;\r\n     the White-crowned Bunting's sonorous note reaching the\r\n     ear ever and anon; the crowds of sea-birds in search of\r\n     places wherein to repose or to feed: how beautiful is\r\n     all this in this wonderful rocky desert at this season,\r\n     the beginning of July, compared with the horrid blasts\r\n     of winter which here predominate by the will of God,\r\n     when every rock is rendered smooth with snows so deep\r\n     that every step the traveller takes is as if entering\r\n     into his grave; for even should he escape an avalanche,\r\n     his eye dreads to search the horizon, for full well\r\n     does he know that snow,—snow, is all that can be seen. I\r\n     watched the Ring Plover for some time; the parents were\r\n     so intent on saving their young that they both lay on\r\n     the rocks as if shot, quivering their wings and dragging\r\n     their bodies as if quite disabled. We left them and\r\n     their young to the care of the Creator. I would not have\r\n     shot one of the old ones, or taken one of the young for\r\n     any consideration, and I was glad my young men were as\r\n     forbearing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE CXI\r\n    _Pileated Woodpecker_,\r\n    PICUS PILEATUS, Linn.\r\n    _Adult Male, 1. Adult Female, 2. Young Males, 3. 4. Racoon Grape.\r\n    Vitis astivalis._\r\n\r\n    Drawn from nature by J. J. Audubon, F.R.S. F.L.S.\r\n    Engraved, Printed & Coloured by R. Havell.]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of July he wrote:[38]\r\n\r\n     By dint of hard work and rising at three, I have drawn\r\n     a _Colymbus septemtrionalis_ [Great Northern Diver]\r\n     and a young one, and nearly finished a Ptarmigan; this\r\n     afternoon, however, at half-past five, my fingers could\r\n     no longer hold my pencil, and I was forced to abandon\r\n     my work and go ashore for exercise. The fact is that I\r\n     am growing old too fast; alas! I feel it,—and yet work\r\n     I will, and may God grant me life to see the last plate\r\n     of my mammoth work finished.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh there is this note:\r\n\r\n     Drawing all day; finished the female Grouse and five\r\n     young, and prepared the male bird. The captain, John,\r\n     and Lincoln, went off this afternoon with a view to camp\r\n     on a bay about ten miles distant. Soon after, we had a\r\n     change of weather, and, for a wonder, bright lightning\r\n     and something like summer clouds. When fatigued with\r\n     drawing I went on shore for exercise, and saw many\r\n     pretty flowers, amongst them a flowering Sea-pea, quite\r\n     rich in color.... The mosquitoes quite as numerous as in\r\n     Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOn July 14 the _Ripley_ took the party forty-three miles farther east\r\nto Little Maccatina, or Hare Harbor, as it is called today, where they\r\nremained until July 21, proceeding thence to Baie de Portage. Here\r\nthey were able to enter their small boats, and visited the captain\r\nof a whaling schooner from New Brunswick, a Canadian trapper, and a\r\nScotchman, Samuel Robertson by name, who was engaged in the sealing\r\nindustry at Sparr Point, all of whom Audubon pumped for information on\r\nthe country and its products. On July 25, they started for \"Chevalier's\r\nSettlement,\" but were caught in a storm, and came to in Bras d'Or\r\n(Bradore) Bay; there they found the Labrador Duck, which in 1875, but\r\nforty-two years later, had become totally extinct.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of August the brief Labrador summer, of barely one\r\nmonth, was drawing to a close, and Audubon was exerting his utmost\r\nefforts to accomplish his purposes. Under date of August 10 he\r\nwrote:[39]\r\n\r\n     My reason for not writing at night is that I have\r\n     been drawing so constantly, often seventeen hours a\r\n     day, that the weariness of my body at night has been\r\n     unprecedented, by such work at least. At times I felt\r\n     as if my physical powers would abandon me; my neck, my\r\n     shoulders, and, more than all, my fingers, were almost\r\n     useless through actual fatigue at drawing. Who would\r\n     believe this? Yet, nothing is more true. When at the\r\n     return of dawn my spirits called me out of my berth,\r\n     my body seemed to beg my mind to suffer it to rest a\r\n     while longer; and as dark forced me to lay aside my\r\n     brushes I immediately went to rest as if I had walked\r\n     sixty-five miles that day, as I have done _a few times_\r\n     in my stronger days. Yesternight, when I rose from my\r\n     little seat to contemplate my work and to judge of the\r\n     effect of it compared with the nature which I had been\r\n     attempting to copy, it was the affair of a moment;\r\n     instead of waiting, as I always like to do, until the\r\n     hazy darkness which is to me the best time to judge of\r\n     the strength of light and shade, I went at once to rest\r\n     as if delivered from the heaviest task I ever performed.\r\n     The young men think my fatigue is added to by the fact\r\n     that I often work in wet clothes, but I have done that\r\n     all my life with no ill effects. No! no! it is that I am\r\n     no longer young. But I thank God that I did accomplish\r\n     my task; my drawings are finished to the best of my\r\n     ability, (and) the skins well prepared by John.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of August all hands parted with Labrador without regret,\r\nand the captain of the _Ripley_ steered for Newfoundland, where they\r\nlanded in St. George's Harbor on the 13th. That region was searched\r\nfor five days, when a fresh start was made for Pictou, Nova Scotia,\r\nbut when they encountered head winds, Audubon and his party were\r\nlanded on the nearest shore and made their way overland to the town.\r\nThence they proceeded to Truro and Halifax, and after three days\r\nwent on to Windsor, where they watched the famous tides in the Bay of\r\nFundy—emptying and filling a broad river, and rising, in course, to a\r\nheight of sixty-five feet. From that point a steamboat was taken to St.\r\nJohns, New Brunswick, where the faithful Harris awaited the naturalist\r\nwith tidings of his wife and elder son;[40] this intelligence induced\r\nhim to abandon his contemplated course through the woods of Quebec and\r\nhasten back to the United States. The party finally reached Eastport on\r\nAugust 31, after being out nearly twelve weeks. When the _Ripley_ had\r\ndocked and their collections were securely packed, all but Coolidge and\r\nLincoln returned to Boston, and on September 7 Audubon was again in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThe Labrador experience was in a measure disappointing, but the\r\nnaturalist brought back twenty-three large drawings of birds, complete\r\nor nearly so, and seventy-three bird skins, as well as considerable\r\ncollections of marine animals and plants. The expenses of the journey\r\nhad been heavy, amounting, as he told his son, to \"about $2,000,\" but\r\none fine morning when they had flushed a Black Poll Warbler from its\r\nnest, Audubon felt that he was amply \"refunded in the sight,\" though\r\nthis bird was later found to have a much wider breeding range than he\r\nthen supposed.\r\n\r\nThe _National Gazette_ of Philadelphia[41] published a long editorial\r\nupon Audubon's return, as well as an extended account of his journey,\r\nextracted from the _Boston Patriot_. To quote the editor's comment:\r\n\r\n     The distinguished naturalist returned from his\r\n     northeastern excursion to Boston Wednesday last. We\r\n     believe that there is no one who will not be gratified\r\n     to learn the progress of his arduous and unremitted\r\n     labors in a branch of science, which he has made\r\n     peculiarly his own; and he has kindly favored us with\r\n     information on the subject of his recent tour, which we\r\n     are glad to lay before our readers; regretting only that\r\n     we are unable to present it in his own rich and animated\r\n     language, and to invest it with the attractions which it\r\n     would derive from his own descriptive powers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LETTER OF ROBERT HAVELL TO AUDUBON, JUNE 15, 1833.\r\n\r\n    From the Deane MSS.]\r\n\r\nWhile at Halifax Audubon received a congratulatory letter from\r\nBachman, who urged him to visit Charleston and to bring his family.\r\nThe invitation was accepted, and early in September Audubon returned to\r\nNew York, where he immediately prepared the new drawings for dispatch\r\nto London; thirteen of the land birds were for the completion of his\r\nsecond volume, and seventeen, representing water fowl, were to form the\r\ninitial series of the third; all, as usual, were heavily insured.\r\n\r\nAudubon left New York with his wife on September 25 and spent nearly a\r\nmonth _en route_ to Charleston, while John, who intended to accompany\r\nhis father to Florida, went direct by water. Dr. Thomas L. McKenney, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in a letter to Lewis Cass, Secretary of War, said:[42]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Audubon makes no more of tracking it in all\r\n     directions over this, and I may add other countries,\r\n     than a shot star does in crossing the heavens. He goes\r\n     after winged things, but sometimes needs the aid of—at\r\n     least a few feathers, to assist him better to fly.\r\n     He means to coast it again round Florida—make a track\r\n     through Arkansas—go up the Missouri—pass on to the Rocky\r\n     Mountains, and thence to the Pacific. He will require\r\n     some of your official aid.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to the warmth of Audubon's greeting in Philadelphia,\r\nwhile in that city he was arrested for debt, and was on the point of\r\nbeing taken to jail when he was offered bail by a friend. \"This event,\"\r\nhe said, \"brings to my mind so many disagreeable thoughts connected\r\nwith my former business transactions, in which I was _always_ the\r\n_single_ loser, that I will only add I made all necessary arrangements\r\nto have it paid.\"\r\n\r\nFour new subscribers were obtained at Baltimore, but when the\r\nnaturalist applied to Secretary Cass at Washington for the privilege of\r\naccompanying an expedition to the Rocky Mountains under the patronage\r\nof the Government, he met with a cool reception, and though he had\r\nforgotten his letter from Dr. McKenney, he was resolved not to trouble\r\nthat official further. At this juncture he met Washington Irving, who\r\ndid his best to save the situation, and thought that Audubon had been\r\nmistaken in his judgment of the Secretary; \"I might have been,\" he\r\nsaid, \"but those eyes of mine have discovered more truth in men's eyes\r\nthan their mouths were willing to acknowledge.\" Irving accompanied him\r\nto the offices of Mr. Taney, the Secretary of the Treasury, who at once\r\ngave the naturalist the privileges of the revenue cutter service on the\r\nsouthern coast.\r\n\r\nAt Richmond Audubon met Governor Floyd, who promised to try to induce\r\nthe legislature of his State to subscribe for a copy of the _Birds_.\r\nFrom that point to Charleston we shall follow their itinerary as given\r\nin his journal under date of October 16:[43]\r\n\r\n     We left Richmond this morning in a stage well crammed\r\n     with Italian musicians and southern merchants, arrived\r\n     at Petersburg at a late hour, dined, and were again\r\n     crammed in a car drawn by a locomotive, which dragged us\r\n     twelve miles an hour, and sent out sparks of fire enough\r\n     to keep us constantly busy in extinguishing them on our\r\n     clothes. At Blakely we were again crammed into a stage,\r\n     and dragged two miles an hour. We crossed the Roanoke\r\n     River by torchlight in a flatboat, passed through\r\n     Halifax, Raleigh, Fayetteville, and Columbia, where we\r\n     spent the night. Here I met Dr. Gibbs, at whose house\r\n     we passed the evening, and who assisted me greatly; at\r\n     his house I met President Thomas Cooper, who assured\r\n     me he had seen a rattlesnake climb a five-rail fence on\r\n     his land. I received from the treasury of the State four\r\n     hundred and fifty dollars on account of its subscription\r\n     for one copy of the \"Birds of America.\"\r\n\r\nFor a number of years Audubon's snake stories had subjected him to\r\nno little ridicule in certain quarters, and this notice of a climbing\r\nrattlesnake pleased him so much that he asked the venerable president\r\nto put his statement in writing; he willingly complied, and his\r\ninteresting letter on the subject will be given in a later chapter.[44]\r\n\r\nWhen Audubon and his wife reached the Bachman home on October 24,\r\nhe was prepared to push on to the South, but changed his plans, on\r\naccount, he said, \"of the removal of my good friend Captain Robert\r\nDay from his former station to New York, and I did not like to launch\r\non the Florida reefs in the care of a young officer unknown to me.\"\r\nThe winter of 1833-4 was passed under the hospitable rooftree of his\r\nfriend, in the usual occupations of painting, writing and hunting\r\nbirds. At this time an attachment sprang up between his younger son,\r\nJohn Woodhouse Audubon, and Maria Rebecca, the eldest daughter of the\r\nBachman household. Here Audubon wrote the first drafts of many of the\r\nbird biographies contained in the second volume of his letterpress,\r\nand with Bachman conducted a series of careful experiments on the\r\npower of smell in vultures, in order to settle a question which had\r\nthen become acute among naturalists.[45] This subject is referred to\r\nin the following intimate letter,[46] which reveals the confidence\r\nwhich Audubon felt in his sons and in their united ability to bring his\r\ngreat undertaking to a successful issue, as well as the infinite pains\r\nwhich he bestowed upon every part of it. Audubon, who was now in his\r\nforty-ninth year, felt that he was aging very fast, and declared that\r\none year then would be equal to three, three years from that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to his Son, Victor_\r\n\r\n          CHARLESTON, _Dc., 24, 1833_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR BELOVED VICTOR:—\r\n\r\n     Your last letter to us is dated at London, 7th. Octbr.\r\n     It has given us all ample and sincere pleasure. The\r\n     copy of your reply[47] to Mons. Waterton is excellent;\r\n     that from Swainson ought to prove a death-blow to the\r\n     Demerara Gent! I hope that these letters are now before\r\n     the world, for my mortification has been great enough\r\n     respecting the blackguardism of G. Ord and others, and\r\n     yet I am heartily glad that I never paid personally\r\n     any attention to them through the press or otherwise.\r\n     Here my friends are as much shocked as myself, and the\r\n     moment is at hand when these T... will be glad to find\r\n     some hiding place to resort to, and wait for time to\r\n     obliterate their obvious jealousy and falsehood.\r\n\r\n     John Bachman and myself have begun a second series of\r\n     experiments, such as I made before, connected with the\r\n     nose-smelling of Turkey Buzzards; as far as we have gone\r\n     through them, these experiments have proved _perfectly_\r\n     satisfactory to my good friend and myself, and depend\r\n     [upon] it, from next Wednesday, the American World will\r\n     know that Turkey Buzzards are first, Gregarious, as well\r\n     as the Carrion Crow [Black Vulture], that they eat fresh\r\n     meat in preference to putrid stuff; that they eat birds,\r\n     fresh killed, either plucked or not, _even of their own\r\n     species_; that they suck birds' eggs, and devour their\r\n     callow young; that they come to their food by their\r\n     sense of sight, and not that of smell, and lastly that\r\n     they cannot discover by any sense of smell the most\r\n     putrid matter, even when this putrid stuff is within\r\n     a few feet of them, out of sight of their eyes. Were\r\n     Snakes as abundant near Charleston as Buzzards, that\r\n     business would soon be also set at rest, but for this,\r\n     however, time is required, and the time I think will\r\n     come. The experiments we are making will be repeated in\r\n     the presence of the faculty of this city,[48] and their\r\n     Certificates attached to the whole, and immediately\r\n     published in the Annals of the Philosophical Society of\r\n     Phila.[49] those of the Lyceum of New York. A copy will\r\n     be sent to be read at the Linnean, or Royal Society of\r\n     London, and Royal Institute of France; then let those\r\n     laugh who win. We have attracted Turkey Buzzards with\r\n     pieces of fresh beef, not more than an inch square, and\r\n     we have seen others pass unnoticed the body of a hare or\r\n     fowl within 20 steps. We have now 3 fine birds of this\r\n     species to experiment upon, and their olfactory nerves\r\n     will be examined by the faculty here, where there are\r\n     some highly talented men.\r\n\r\n     Our friend Bachman has written a very fine paper for\r\n     Loudon's Mag.[50] which will be forwarded to you in a\r\n     few days by duplicate, and which I wish you to give to\r\n     our friend J. G. Children, and ask him to have it read\r\n     at the R. and L. Societies, and inserted in the above\r\n     mentioned Mag. afterwards. We hope all this will be\r\n     accomplished by the 1st. March next.\r\n\r\n     Now to other subjects. We are deeply at work. John\r\n     has drawn a few Birds, as good as any I ever made, and\r\n     in a few months I hope to give this department of my\r\n     duty up to him altogether; his improvements on other\r\n     subjects are equally pleasing. I write a [biography of\r\n     a] Bird or so every evening, and our friend grants me\r\n     all his knowledge of the habits of those with which he\r\n     has become well acquainted, belonging to this part of\r\n     the Union. I have nearly _one 100_ drawings of Water\r\n     Birds ready for publication & I pronounce them equal\r\n     to any previous ones. I am much pleased at the news\r\n     you give me respecting Havell; I hope he will continue\r\n     with hand and heart to do all in his power for the fame\r\n     of our work, and for himself. We have not seen Nos.\r\n     34, 35, tho. from your letter we suppose them to be\r\n     in New York. Wm. Oakes, I have written you, has paid\r\n     all, up to No. 33; Arnold, of New Bedford, for all he\r\n     has had; John Neal has his copy, but I do not know if\r\n     he has yet paid Dr. Parkman, who is our kind friend\r\n     and agent in that part of the Country. I wish you had\r\n     forwarded _first volumes_ bound, as you had those on\r\n     hand, as several would have been disposed of and paid\r\n     for by this time; do send all, or whatever of them you\r\n     have ready, as _soon as possible_. It will be well for\r\n     you to have friend Bachm's. paper published in _toto_,\r\n     in some _good circulating paper_ in London & Edinboro.\r\n     Brushes! Brushes! Brushes! I am glad to hear of Kidd &\r\n     Co.'s publication of Parrots, but I regret that my face\r\n     should have been there from Syme's picture, which in\r\n     my estimation is none of the best. Push Kidd with the\r\n     pictures; _have them, and take care of them_. Sell all\r\n     the Shells you please; write to John Adamson, of New\r\n     Castle, about them, but keep smug all the Bird Skins.\r\n     I cannot do without them when I write my Synopsis,\r\n     which will be when I am with you. Our voyage round the\r\n     Floridas, Gulph Mexico &c. will begin about the 1st.\r\n     February. This will be my last journey, after which\r\n     John and I will hunt for Subscribers, procure a round\r\n     number, and join you as soon as possible. Your dear Mama\r\n     will in all probability join you in May or June next.\r\n     In about a fortnight I shall send you more land Birds\r\n     for the end of the 2d. volume, extra small plates, and\r\n     several _numbers_ of _Water_ Birds. I am anxious to hear\r\n     something about the little edition. Do not omit to let\r\n     me know when you want money, for tho. our expenses are\r\n     always great, _the Work_ must not, and shall not suffer,\r\n     as long as my eyes and hands can work.\r\n\r\n     Dec. 23d., last evening, we had the pleasure of yours\r\n     of the 28 Oct, and one from Havell of the 9th. Regarding\r\n     Havell, we are glad that all is well with him, and hope\r\n     he will not trouble us about extra prices, not even for\r\n     the _Water Birds_. The safe arrival of my last drawings\r\n     has relieved me of that anxiety. You are quite right on\r\n     the score of _advice_. _You_ in England, will do best\r\n     to act as you may think proper. _We_, in America, are\r\n     trying to do equally well, and our little _Alliance_ is\r\n     as efficient as the Holy one at least. That Subscribers\r\n     should die is an event we cannot help; that such fellows\r\n     as V. should act so cannot be controlled, but depend\r\n     upon our _industry_, our _truth_, and the regular manner\r\n     in which we publish our work; this will always prove\r\n     to the world and to our Patrons that nothing more can\r\n     be done than what we do; nay, I doubt if any _family_,\r\n     with our pecuniary means, ever will raise for themselves\r\n     such a monument as the \"Birds of America\" is, over their\r\n     tomb.\r\n\r\n     How comes it that Harlan has not money enough to pay\r\n     his expenses in Europe? I shall remember the 20 £, and\r\n     the exchange. Chamley, of New Castle, was never prompt\r\n     pay; indeed, my dear Victor, were you fully acquainted\r\n     with the great difficulties which I had to surmount and\r\n     did surmount, it would give you less fear than you now\r\n     feel or experience. We shall be glad to receive the\r\n     Brushes that are, I hope, now under way for us. Mr.\r\n     Miesson resides [at] No. 2 Rue Pigalle, on the east\r\n     side of the grand Boulevards. Present my regards to Mr.\r\n     Yarrell, and thank him in my name for his kind offer\r\n     of eggs, and add that I shall have it in my power to\r\n     present him with many which I think he has not found,\r\n     that our two collections will most likely comprise the\r\n     whole of those published in my 4 volumes. I fear that\r\n     to give the eggs in the 2d. of Biography would render\r\n     that volume too large, and again too costly, and that\r\n     a few plates of eggs at the end of the large work will\r\n     answer better.[51] The _plates_ ought to be insured for\r\n     at least 4 or 5 times the cost, for should they by an\r\n     accident be destroyed, the amount of their cost would\r\n     prove a poor remuneration, when compared with the time\r\n     it would require to have them renewed. Attend to this\r\n     as soon as you can. Henry Ward has rendered himself\r\n     very obnoxious _here_. a letter came to Mr. B. on last\r\n     evening from St. Augustine, to inquire how a certain\r\n     amount left by him unpaid was to be settled. Mr. Bachman\r\n     will inform you of the particulars.\r\n\r\n     Do forward the bound volumes as soon as possible,\r\n     for with them I could at once make you a considerable\r\n     remittance, which would enable you to prepare the Nos.\r\n     of the 2d. Vol. for those who do not wish to have it\r\n     complete. I am trying to receive some money on Act.\r\n     of the 2d. Vol. through the mediums of Dr. Parkman, N.\r\n     Berthoud, John Bellonis, Wm. Gaston, and will let you\r\n     know the result. The Plate ... which you sent me is\r\n     _extremely well_ engraved, but let us keep to Havell as\r\n     long as he behaves with propriety, and does good work.\r\n\r\n     I have now replied to your letter fully, except on what\r\n     you say about my immediate _return_. The following are\r\n     my views, but if after all, you say—come on, _I shall\r\n     do so_. Our country is becoming more wealthy every day.\r\n     Science is looked upon with more congeniality every\r\n     year. Subscribers in this Dear Country of ours do not\r\n     drop off unless they die. They pay punctually on demand,\r\n     and to have more of them in this land than in Europe is\r\n     a thing that may prove of the greatest importance _to\r\n     us_. When I visited our woods on my first return from\r\n     England, I was absent about 12 months. The Rathbones\r\n     and Mr. Children wrote to me many times to return,\r\n     or expect the work to fall. I went back to Europe\r\n     before I was ready to go, and on my arrival there, to\r\n     my surprise and joy, I found everything going on as\r\n     well as usual; but I was again obliged to come to our\r\n     Country to renew my researches, and improve my head,\r\n     as well as my collection of drawings. I had then left\r\n     no one like you in England. Now you, my Dear Son, are\r\n     there; thank God for it! You prove to be a better man\r\n     at carrying on the publication than myself, and to tell\r\n     you more, I doubt if I could procure more subscribers\r\n     there than yourself. I am truly desirous for your sake,\r\n     and that of your dear Mother and Brother, to do all\r\n     in my power for the completion of this great work. I\r\n     wish to finish here all that is to be done both in the\r\n     way of drawing, and increase of knowledge, in _black\r\n     and white_, and also in Patrons, as much as possible,\r\n     ere I return to Europe, where, when I do go, I must\r\n     remain several years, if not until the completion of the\r\n     engraving. I am growing old very fast; in 3 or 4 years\r\n     my career as a traveller will be ended, and should I be\r\n     obliged to renew my field-labours, it is doubtful if my\r\n     constitution could bear it. One year now is equal to\r\n     3, 3 years hence. I receive much assistance from the\r\n     Government, and have John to accompany me. I am still\r\n     able to undergo some fatigue, and, as I have said, I am\r\n     anxious, _very anxious_, to do all that can be done ere\r\n     I return to Europe. Now the whole time which I conceive\r\n     necessary to enable me to perform these desideratums\r\n     cannot exceed 12 or 15 months. What pleasure it would\r\n     be to us all, when I take your hand and press you to my\r\n     heart, I should also have a list of _100 new names from\r\n     America!_; all the drawings and the manuscripts ready\r\n     for the completion of this our wonderful undertaking.\r\n     I would advise you to address a circular letter to\r\n     all those who may be concerned in Europe, to acquaint\r\n     them with what _I call_ the necessity of my being in\r\n     America, for the _sole purpose_ of increasing the value\r\n     of our publications, either Illustrative or graphical.\r\n     This, and the constant improvement now exhibited to\r\n     them with each new number of the work, could not fail,\r\n     I think, to render them quiet, if not pleased, that I\r\n     am now doing all I can for the advantage of the work.\r\n     Tell them the facts, that I have greatly added to the\r\n     Ornithology of the United States since my absence from\r\n     Europe, that the number of species which I now have,\r\n     and that are not given by Wilson or Bonaparte, combined,\r\n     amounts to nearly one hundred, and that the Water Birds\r\n     will be fully equal in point of interest and beauty, to\r\n     any of the land Birds that are published. And, not the\r\n     least part of this, my remaining in America has already\r\n     [given], and will continue, to give me the power of\r\n     portraying the habits of the Water Birds with more truth\r\n     and completeness than has ever yet been done. Next, have\r\n     extracts of my letter to you, before the world's eye,\r\n     through the medium of Papers. Visit such of our friends,\r\n     and ask them to say those things to their acquaintance;\r\n     go on yourself, as you have done, and depend upon it,\r\n     we shall all be _greatly benefitted_. In your most kind\r\n     letter to John you mention with unexampled modesty what\r\n     you are attempting to do in the way of self-improvement,\r\n     but my Dear Victor, you cannot convey more thoroughly\r\n     to us the _march_ of your improvement than you have done\r\n     by sending your letters, and the result of your actions,\r\n     so well delineated as this is, and _we all_ feel deeply\r\n     gratified and most happy. Cruickshank is _right_;\r\n     by _drawing_ you are enabled to study the lights and\r\n     shadows of bodies, again the beautiful mellowness with\r\n     which, altho. all powerful in _the effect_, these blend\r\n     themselves with each other. The _reflective power of\r\n     bodies_ will also strike your discerning attention, and\r\n     when these combinations of the true Materia are well\r\n     understood, the artist is a Master! Nature after all,\r\n     has done all for us; she groups, and most beautifully,\r\n     every thing that is presented to our eye or mind,\r\n     so completely also, that if one observes a number of\r\n     bodies, no matter what these bodies are, whether horses\r\n     or apes, he sees at once the general elegance of their\r\n     arrangement in _contour_, the force of the light and\r\n     shadows, the mellowness existing between these, and\r\n     as the eye passes on to the finishing of that natural\r\n     picture, it at once pronounces it complete.\r\n\r\n     Do not forget to take from Kidd whatever pictures of\r\n     ours he may have finished, and take good care of them.\r\n     We have pretty nearly kilt G. Ord and Waterton with our\r\n     Buzzard experiments. You say you wish you could see us\r\n     at friend Bachman's; I assure you my pleasure at such\r\n     an event would be equal to yours. We are indeed happy\r\n     in having such a friend. Miss Martin, with her superior\r\n     talents, assists us greatly in the way of drawing;\r\n     the insects she has drawn are, perhaps, the best I've\r\n     seen; at night we have some music and reading. When you\r\n     receive Bird Skins, perhaps it would be as well to form\r\n     a collection of each species in pairs, and variety of\r\n     age or color.\r\n\r\n     24 Dec. We have just received yours of 18th. October.\r\n     You are, my Dear Son, too low spirited respecting my\r\n     immediate appearance in England. Cheer up, my beloved\r\n     Victor! Believe me, when I repeat that our own Dear\r\n     Country will support the efforts of us all, and will\r\n     grant us more Patrons than the whole of Europe together;\r\n     by the way of a nightcap, let me give you the name of\r\n     Wm. J. Rees, of Sumpter district, Statesbury, South\r\n     Carolina, who put his name to my list this afternoon\r\n     at the moment when the Vultures lost their olfactory\r\n     powers, for I daubed the imitation of a sheep, and the\r\n     very first one that passed over the picture rounded and\r\n     came to it.\r\n\r\n     Respecting Kidd, and his prospectus, depend upon it,\r\n     nothing is to be feared from that quarter; that work is\r\n     _dead at the moment I write_, and as to his publishing\r\n     the intention of the pictures, it signifies nothing.\r\n     All you have to do is to _take all_ the pictures from\r\n     him, _by goodwill or otherwise_, and _give him no more\r\n     originals to copy_.\r\n\r\n     If I regret anything at this moment, it is that you\r\n     should have kept the 20 volumes in London, when, if I\r\n     had them in America, I should at once be enabled to make\r\n     you a valuable remittance. Ship them, ensured, as fast\r\n     as possible, and doubt not my disposing of them. Lewis\r\n     Atterbury writes me to night that all the numbers 34,\r\n     35, which Havell has shipped, are injured greatly by\r\n     salt water. I do not know yet if they were insured or\r\n     not. I write to him this evening. Do not ship anything\r\n     without insurance; it is better to lose time in this\r\n     case than money. I will write again in a few days, and I\r\n     shall forward you _Water Birds_ in good time. God bless\r\n     you, my dear fellow; keep up your spirits, and again may\r\n     God bless you.\r\n\r\n          Ever your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n          J. J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nHonest John Bachman, who had lived and worked with Audubon for months\r\nat a time, and who probably knew him better than did any one in America\r\noutside of the naturalist's own family, gave this account of his habits\r\nin 1834, when, at the age of forty-nine, he was still working at his\r\nbest:\r\n\r\n     He rises at the earliest dawn, and devotes the whole of\r\n     the day, in intense industry, to his favourite pursuit.\r\n     The specimens from which he makes his drawings are all\r\n     from nature; carefully noting the colors of the eye,\r\n     bill, and legs; measuring, with great accuracy, every\r\n     part of the bird. When differences exist, either in the\r\n     sexes or young, several figures are given on the same\r\n     plate; sparing no labour in retouching old drawings or\r\n     in making new ones, in all cases where he conceives\r\n     there may be a possibility of making an improvement.\r\n     In this way, he has already succeeded in figuring\r\n     nearly the whole of the birds necessary to complete his\r\n     splendid and important work.\r\n\r\n     He keeps a journal, and regularly notes down every\r\n     thing connected with natural history. This journal\r\n     is always kept in English: a language which, it must\r\n     be acknowledged he writes very correctly, when it is\r\n     taken into consideration that he spent nearly the first\r\n     seventeen years of his life in France. Besides this,\r\n     he keeps separate journals, in which he notes every\r\n     thing that he learns each day on the habits of every\r\n     bird. In all his travels, he carries these journals\r\n     with him; and he never suffers business, fatigue, or\r\n     pleasure to prevent him each evening from noting down\r\n     every interesting observation. In this way, a mass of\r\n     information has been accumulated from year to year. When\r\n     he sits down to write the history of a bird (which is\r\n     usually in the evening), he first reads over all the\r\n     memoranda which he has made with regard to its habits\r\n     and he is generally able to write an interesting paper\r\n     on the subject in the course of an evening. At some\r\n     leisure moment this is again revised and corrected: the\r\n     scientific details he leaves to the last.\r\n\r\nEarly in March, 1834, Audubon left his friends in Charleston, and with\r\nhis wife and son passed northward to Washington and Baltimore. From the\r\nlatter city, on March 9, he wrote to Edward Harris, in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     Friends such as you _have been_, and _are_ still, are\r\n     the only recompense such poor individuals such as I am\r\n     can enjoy in this world, and the more valued as they are\r\n     so very rare.\r\n\r\n     We came from Charleston by land to Norfolk; thence to\r\n     Washington City by steamer in 20 hours, and in 8 to the\r\n     city here, well fatigued but safely.... At Washington,\r\n     where we remained only an hour, Col. J. Abert told me\r\n     something connected with the climbing of Rattlesnakes\r\n     upon trees &c. that will make your mouth water, and your\r\n     generous heart leap with joy, _when you read_ [about]\r\n     them, which you shall do ere long, I give you my word\r\n     for it.\r\n\r\nAudubon was still in Baltimore on March 15, for on that day he gave\r\nHarris a letter of introduction to Edward Everett. New York was reached\r\nin April, when he wrote to Bachman that they had secured berths in\r\n\"that fine packet ship the _North America_,\" which was to sail on the\r\ntenth of that month.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: J.G. CHILDREN\r\n\r\n    AFTER AN ENGRAVING BY W. RADDON OF A PORTRAIT BY EDDIS, 1839.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EDWARD HARRIS\r\n\r\n    REPRODUCED FROM \"CASSINIA\" FOR 1902.]\r\n\r\nToward the close of Audubon's Charleston visit he had an unpleasant\r\nexperience; he was sued for an old debt, which no doubt dated from his\r\nHenderson period and the failure of his mill in 1819.[52] Apparently\r\nthe case was carried into court, where the naturalist was defended by\r\na lawyer named Dunkin, who, if my inference is correct, later became a\r\ndistinguished judge and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court[53] of South\r\nCarolina. The incident was referred to by Audubon in letters written\r\nfrom New York at this time; on April 6, he wrote to Miss Maria Martin\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     I told friend Bach. in my letter of yesterday that\r\n     I knew nothing of Mr. Pettigrue, connected with my\r\n     business at Charleston, and that if that gentleman had\r\n     presented himself before the court, it must have been\r\n     for charity's sake; indeed, from the conversations\r\n     that passed between Friend B. & I respecting Mr. Dunker\r\n     [Dunkin], it would have been absurd in me to think for\r\n     a moment of employing any other person than Mr. D.\r\n\r\nIn the letter just quoted Audubon said also that he had spent all of\r\nthe morning of the previous day in going from shop to shop with friend\r\nHarris to procure some models for \"the dear girls,\" but in vain; New\r\nYork with its two hundred and fifty thousand souls, possessed but two\r\ndrawing masters; \"these instruct in _3 months_,\" he added, \"and starve\r\nfor the nine of the year.\" In reference to financial matters, he said\r\nthat he had managed to collect about £600 sterling, and had sent 500\r\nto Victor in bills of exchange, so that when they reached London, they\r\nwould be tolerably well off, considering that they were \"naturalists\r\nfrom the wilds of America.\" \"Nothing starts the blues so effectually,\"\r\nhe continued, as \"constant unemployment; for myself who have done next\r\nto nothing since I left you, have had horrors all around me; dreams\r\nof sinking and burning ships at night, fears of lost drawings, &\r\nfailures of subscribers by day, have ever and anon been my companions.\"\r\n\"Victor,\" he added, \"has sent 6 boxes of pills, which will be divided\r\ninto 3 parts, the largest for G. Ord.\"\r\n\r\nThe Audubons finally sailed from New York on April 16, 1834. On the\r\npreceding day the naturalist sent his friend, Edward Harris, a parting\r\nletter, in which he said:\r\n\r\n     To tell you that I am surprised at your generous conduct\r\n     in remitting to me Four hundred, Ninety dollars in\r\n     advance, for all the numbers of my book, would be a\r\n     poor gratification to me. I feel your generosity, and I\r\n     cannot say any more. God bless you.\r\n\r\n     Nos. 36 & 37 have reached this place; my drawings\r\n     shipped from Charleston are safely in the hands of\r\n     Victor at London. I have been able to forward him 650\r\n     £, and I have 30 sovereigns to defray our expenses\r\n     from Liverpool to the Great Metropolis. In 1824, poor\r\n     J. had dreams, but how far was I then from believing\r\n     that I should ever have succeeded as I have; who will\r\n     believe my story? Only one or two besides yourself, have\r\n     _an Idea_ of what I have undergone, but, if God grants\r\n     me life, I shall publish that story, and send you the\r\n     sheets thereof, as they are struck by the printer.\r\n\r\nAudubon took with him to England all the collections which he\r\nhad accumulated during nearly three years of travel and search in\r\ndifferent parts of the United States and the British possessions.\r\nDuring this eventful period he had renewed one hundred of his older\r\ndrawings, executed many new ones, discovered new birds, extended his\r\nacquaintance, and added sixty-two names to his list of patrons.\r\n\r\nAfter they had reached Liverpool, he wrote to Bachman, May 8, 1834,\r\nthat they had returned on the \"superb packet of 650 tons, called the\r\n_North America_, commanded by an admirable gentleman, named Dixie of\r\nPhiladelphia\"; the voyage was made in not quite twenty days. A little\r\nlater they joined their son, Victor, in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHORNS ON THE ROSE\r\n\r\n     Contributions to magazines—Attacked in\r\n     Philadelphia—Statement to Sully—The rattlesnake\r\n     episode—Behavior of a Philadelphia editor—Mistaken\r\n     identity in account of the reptile—Lesson of\r\n     the serpent's tooth—Audubon's long lost lily\r\n     rediscovered—\"Nosarians and Anti-Nosarians\"—Bachman and\r\n     Audubon on vultures—Aim of the critics—Authorship in\r\n     the _Biography_—His most persistent heckler—Pitfall of\r\n     analogy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that John James Audubon had attended the school of\r\nadversity many years before he was known to the public in either\r\nAmerica or Europe. The difficulties inseparable from such colossal\r\nundertakings as that in which he engaged were well nigh insuperable;\r\nbut to these were added others which perhaps might have been avoided\r\nbut which could hardly have been foreseen. From the moment he began to\r\nwrite for publication, he was bitterly and persistently assailed by a\r\nnumber of detractors, who seemed bent upon ruining his reputation and\r\nthus undermining the work to which he was devoting his life and upon\r\nwhich he depended as a means of support.\r\n\r\nWere no worthy purpose to be served, it would be folly to resurrect the\r\nanimosities of a past generation, but since a few \"fed fat the ancient\r\ngrudge they bore him,\" and since this hostility, handed down through\r\nthe years, is occasionally echoed at the present day, the impartial\r\nhistorian is left no choice; he must weigh the merits of the case to\r\nthe best of his ability. The reader, I think, will find that the law of\r\ncompensation has worked fairly well in respect to all these matters,\r\nfor if Audubon possessed faults, he was not lacking in merits; if he\r\nwas assailed by a few bitter enemies, he was supported by a host of\r\njudicious friends.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Audubon became known in England, he was importuned to\r\ncontribute to the scientific magazines, and in response to this demand\r\nwrote five articles, which were published in Edinburgh and London\r\nin 1827. Some of these papers, which dealt with the habits of the\r\nTurkey Vulture, the Alligator, the Carrion Crow or Black Vulture,\r\nthe Wild Pigeon, and the Rattlesnake,[54] were roundly scored in the\r\nPhiladelphia press, and Audubon was called a romancer of the first\r\norder. Thomas Sully, the artist, who was then living in that city and\r\nwho had taken a deep interest in the naturalist since their meeting in\r\n1824, wrote in November, 1827, and told him what had occurred. Since\r\nAudubon's reply was practically the only answer which he ever made to\r\nattacks of this sort, and since his friend was given permission to make\r\nsuch use of it as he saw fit, we shall reproduce this letter nearly\r\nentire.[55] In writing to his wife on the same day Audubon said: \"Now\r\nmy Lucy, I am going to answer Sully's letter; it is no difficult task,\r\nso far as truth be connected with my answer, but as regards my feelings\r\nit is perhaps the severest one I have had to encounter for many years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Thomas Sully_\r\n\r\n          LIVERPOOL, _Decr 22, 1837_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. SULLY:—\r\n\r\n     I received from your truly friendly letter of the 7th.\r\n     of November the long wished for intelligence that you\r\n     and your family were well. I am not much astonished that\r\n     in Philadelphia, remarks such as you allude to, should\r\n     have been made respecting some papers on the habits\r\n     of objects of Natural History, read by me to different\r\n     institutions in this country, but I am grieved at it.\r\n\r\n     The greatest portion of my life has been devotedly spent\r\n     in the _active_ investigation of Nature, her beauties\r\n     & her objects in granting to different individuals,\r\n     classes, or species, such privileges as best suit\r\n     their form, situation, or habits. This arduous task I\r\n     have followed with unremitting diligence, and with a\r\n     degree of industry that has caused to my family and to\r\n     myself more troubles than any person in Philadelphia\r\n     can be aware of. For more than 20 years I have been\r\n     in _the regular habit_ of writing down every day all\r\n     the incidents of which I have been an _eye-witness_,\r\n     on the spot, & without confiding to my memory, as\r\n     many travellers have done and still do. You have read\r\n     some portion of this journal, and have also been an\r\n     eye-witness of many of the occurrences, and to this I\r\n     now owe the gratification of possessing your esteem,\r\n     but, My dear Mr. Sully, you are not the only evidence.\r\n     Mr. Joseph Mason, who is now, I believe, an artist\r\n     in your city, accompanied me on a hunting excursion,\r\n     beginning at Cincinati, and ending in the State of\r\n     Louisiana, which lasted 18 months. He drew with me; he\r\n     was my _daily companion_, and we both rolled ourselves\r\n     together on bufaloe robes at night. James Cummings,\r\n     Esq., past captain, the author of a treatise on the\r\n     navigation of the rivers Ohio and Mississippi, was one\r\n     of the party, and he saw me write in my Journal, and\r\n     read it frequently. Every member of my family has seen\r\n     the whole of those Diaries and could readily assert the\r\n     truth of the whole of their contents, to many of which\r\n     they were party, present and acting.\r\n\r\n     The papers alluded to in your estimable letter, are\r\n     merely copies from those journals; they were transcribed\r\n     in Edinburgh, and the style corrected by patrons, who\r\n     saw the originals, nearly worn out by time and the\r\n     casual dampness, which journals like mine must often\r\n     be exposed to. I read these papers to the different\r\n     societies, of which I have the honor to be a member, and\r\n     read them with a sensation of pleasure that nothing but\r\n     a full persuasion of their truth could bestow.\r\n\r\n     Those persons in Philadelphia that have felt a desire\r\n     to contradict my assertions cannot, without lowering\r\n     themselves very much indeed affect to conceive that the\r\n     members of the Wernerian Society would have listened to\r\n     my \"say so,\" without investigating the subject, even\r\n     if they had not been well versed in the habits of the\r\n     objects I treated of. Neither can they believe that\r\n     all my acquaintance and particular friends would permit\r\n     me to proceed in relating _Tales of Wonder_, which if\r\n     untrue, would load me with disgrace, ruin my family,\r\n     nay, prove me devoid of all honor! Could I suffer myself\r\n     to be so blinded at the very moment when I am engaged\r\n     in the publication of a work of unparalled magnitude, of\r\n     which the _greatest naturalists and best judges_ both in\r\n     America and in Europe have given the fullest praise and\r\n     firmest support, & from which my very means of pecuniary\r\n     comfort are to be drawn? It would certainly be highly\r\n     unfair to conceive & assert that at the time whilst\r\n     I was portraying individuals, animal and vegetable,\r\n     I should have rambled so wide and so far from facts\r\n     in a portion of science so intimately connected with\r\n     & necessary to the support of those delineations, as\r\n     well as to the general standing of my reputation! Mere\r\n     interest would suggest a very contrary line of conduct,\r\n     and I hope I am not so devoid of common sense as to\r\n     lose sight of all that can render life desirable in this\r\n     world or the world hereafter.\r\n\r\n     No, my dear Mr. Sully, I have written with care what\r\n     I have seen, and have felt a great desire to spread\r\n     the knowledge I have obtained in the great field of\r\n     Science for the benefit of the world at large, and I\r\n     rest content with this motto: \"Le temps découvrira\r\n     la vérité.\" To whom then, my dear Mr. Sully, can I\r\n     ascribe the birth of the animadversions expressed in\r\n     the papers of Philadelphia! Is their author one [who]\r\n     comes avowedly forward with a life spent in the woods,\r\n     loaded with facts differing in every respect from mine,\r\n     one who like me can bring forth vouchers, and who can\r\n     by respectable witnesses support what he says? Or, is he\r\n     one, who, writing at random and without any knowledge of\r\n     his subject, merely wishes to push himself into notice\r\n     by a blunt denial of my veracity, and would _edify_\r\n     & _please_ some of his friends, at the price of my\r\n     reputation. I think, my dear Mr. Sully, the latter much\r\n     more applicable, and must belong to the author of the\r\n     report current in your city.\r\n\r\n     I have not read any of the Philadelphia papers since I\r\n     came to England, and do not know the tone of the attacks\r\n     upon me, but judging from your friendly letter, I feel\r\n     assured that the pen that traced them must have been\r\n     dipped in venom more noxious than that which flows from\r\n     the jaws of the rattlesnake!\r\n\r\n     To you, my dear Friend, I solemly affirm that however\r\n     unnatural my observations may _appear_, they are all\r\n     _facts_, without a word of exaggeration. My fate in\r\n     this instance differs not from that of many others,\r\n     but believe me, will differ widely from that of the\r\n     illustrious Bruce; those attacks will not make me die of\r\n     sorrow!\r\n\r\n     With this, my dear Friend, I will close the subject,\r\n     giving you meanwhile full liberty to use this letter in\r\n     any manner that may best suit your feelings, and I will\r\n     now pass on to other things.\r\n\r\n     My success in the mother country continues to augment\r\n     apace. I have many most valuable friends and patrons,\r\n     and discovered soon after my landing that Science has\r\n     no particular country. The 5th. number of my work is\r\n     now published, & completes my labor for 1827. During\r\n     my progress I have often received letters from highly\r\n     distinguished characters, expressive of the highest\r\n     approbation, & I hope by regular industry to be able\r\n     to go on with the performance, with credit to myself &\r\n     benefit to my family.\r\n\r\n     I shall leave this town for London in a few days, when I\r\n     will convey your wishes to Robert Sully, & [when] there\r\n     I hope to see the picture which you have sent to the\r\n     Marquis of Wellesley....\r\n\r\nThe attack referred to in the letter just quoted was called forth by\r\nAudubon's unfortunate paper on the Rattlesnake,[56] which was read\r\nbefore the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh in the winter of 1827 and\r\npublished by Robert Jameson in the _New Philosophical Journal_ in April\r\nof that year. The controversy then started was long and bitter, while\r\nthe merits of neither side were ever fully established; in the history\r\nwhich follows we shall see that the naturalist was, on the whole, more\r\nsinned against than sinning.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1828, Dr. Thomas P. Jones[57] appropriated Audubon's\r\nRattlesnake article, and published it without acknowledgment in the\r\n_Franklin Journal and American Mechanics' Magazine_ at Philadelphia.\r\nIt should be noticed that at the close of 1827 Audubon's famous plate\r\nof the Mocking Birds defending their nest against the sinister designs\r\nof this formidable reptile had also been published in London. In this\r\nremarkable picture the rattlesnake was represented coiled about the\r\nnest, at the fatal moment when ready to strike its bold defenders,\r\nand in a tree. The anomaly was apparent, for the climbing habits of\r\nrattlesnakes were not then generally understood. This circumstance,\r\ntogether with some of Audubon's notes, repeated in certain cases from\r\nstories current in rural communities, furnished his detractors with\r\na powerful lever, which they seized with avidity; snakes coiled in\r\ntrees seemed suddenly to have produced a brood of another order which\r\nlurked in the grass, and it was many years before Audubon heard the\r\nlast of his snake stories. The attack in the American press was laid\r\nto the door of George Ord, and it was not long before it was renewed\r\nwith great vigor by his friend and correspondent in England, Charles\r\nWaterton, who proclaimed Audubon as a new and greater Münchhausen.[58]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n         JOHN BACHMAN                 GEORGE ORD\r\n     SAMUEL LATHAM MITCHELL        CHARLES WATERTON\r\n\r\n    BACHMAN FROM C. L. BACHMAN, \"JOHN BACHMAN, D.D., LL.D.\"; ORD FROM\r\n    \"CASSINIA\" FOR 1908; MITCHELL AFTER AN ENGRAVING BY GAMBER AND\r\n    DICK OF A PORTRAIT BY HENRY INMAN; WATERTON FROM MOORE'S EDITION OF\r\n    WATERTON'S \"ESSAYS.\"]\r\n\r\nDr. Jones immediately repudiated the article which he had\r\nunceremoniously appropriated, and under the title of \"The Romance of\r\nthe Rattlesnake\" inserted the following notice in the August number of\r\nhis magazine:[59]\r\n\r\n     Just as the Editor was leaving Philadelphia for\r\n     Washington, he was pressed for \"more copy\" by his\r\n     printer, and hastily marked some articles for insertion,\r\n     among which were \"Notes on the Rattlesnake,\" by John\r\n     James Audubon, F.R.S.E., M.W.S., &c. Time did not\r\n     admit of reading the article, but it was seen that the\r\n     writer professed to offer the \"fruits of many years'\r\n     observation, in countries where snakes abound.\" This\r\n     with his titles, and the bold and splendid assurances\r\n     which we had seen respecting the publication of\r\n     his works, served as a password to his tissues of\r\n     falsehoods, which would have been expunged from the\r\n     proof, but for absence from the press.\r\n\r\n     We had determined to publish a notice like the\r\n     foregoing, when we received a note from a scientific\r\n     friend, whose remarks are, at once, so pointed and\r\n     correct, and so fully express our own ideas upon the\r\n     subject, that we gladly adopt and insert them.\r\n\r\n     It is a tissue of the grossest falsehoods ever attempted\r\n     to be palmed upon the credulity of mankind, and it is\r\n     a pity that any thing like countenance should be given\r\n     to it, by reproducing it in a respectable Journal.\r\n     The romances of Audubon rival those of Münchausen,\r\n     Mandeville, or even Mendez de Pinto, in the total want\r\n     of truth, however short they may fall of them in the\r\n     amusement they afford.\r\n\r\nThis was rather a stiff charge to be made flatly against the reputation\r\nof any one without the most careful investigation, even upon the\r\nauthority of \"a scientific friend.\" Let us see, then, what basis, if\r\nany, really existed for such sweeping charges. In the paper which\r\ncaused the trouble Audubon had described in great detail how he\r\nhad seen a large rattlesnake pursue, capture, kill by constriction,\r\nand devour a gray squirrel. Before quoting his description of this\r\nsingular encounter, we shall recall a passage which Audubon wrote in\r\nhis journal at the time when it occurred,[60] when he was at \"Oakley,\"\r\nthe plantation of James Pirrie at St. Francisville, Bayou Sara, in the\r\nsummer of 1821: \"August 25. Finished drawing a very fine specimen of a\r\nrattlesnake, which measured five feet and seven inches, weighed six and\r\na quarter pounds, and had ten rattles. Anxious to give it a position\r\nmost interesting to a naturalist, I put it in that which the reptile\r\ncommonly takes when on the point of striking madly with its fangs.\"\r\nAfter describing a rough dissection which he made of the rattlesnake's\r\ndental arsenal and poison apparatus, he added: \"The heat of the weather\r\nwas such that I could devote only sixteen hours to the drawing.\" The\r\ndrawing thus referred to was undoubtedly used in the composition of his\r\ncelebrated plate.\r\n\r\nTo revert now to a mooted passage in Audubon's published paper:\r\n\r\n     Rattlesnakes hunt and secure for their prey, with ease,\r\n     grey squirrels that abound in our woods; therefore they\r\n     must be possessed of swiftness to obtain them. Having\r\n     enjoyed the pleasure of beholding such a chase in full\r\n     view in the year 1821, I shall detail its circumstances.\r\n     Whilst lying on the ground to watch the habits of a bird\r\n     that was new to me, previous to shooting it, I heard\r\n     a smart rustling not far from me, and turning my head\r\n     that way, saw, at the same moment, a grey squirrel full\r\n     grown, issuing from a thicket, and bouncing off in a\r\n     straight direction, in leaps of several feet at a time,\r\n     and, not more than twenty feet behind, a rattlesnake of\r\n     ordinary size, pursuing, drawn apparently out to its\r\n     full length, and sliding over the ground so rapidly\r\n     that, as they both moved away from me, I was at no\r\n     loss to observe the snake gain upon the squirrel. The\r\n     squirrel made for a tree, and ascended to its topmost\r\n     branches as nimbly as squirrels are known to do. The\r\n     snake performed the same task considerably more slowly,\r\n     yet so fast that the squirrel never raised its tail nor\r\n     barked, but eyed the enemy attentively as he mounted and\r\n     approached. When within a few yards the squirrel leaped\r\n     to another branch, and the snake followed by stretching\r\n     full two-thirds of its body, whilst the remainder held\r\n     it securely from falling. Passing thus from branch to\r\n     branch, with a rapidity that astonished me, the squirrel\r\n     went in and out of several holes, but remained in none,\r\n     knowing well that, wherever its head could enter, the\r\n     body of its antagonist would follow; and, at last, much\r\n     exhausted and terrified, took a desperate leap, and came\r\n     to the earth with legs and tail spread to the utmost to\r\n     ease the fall. That instant the snake dropt also, and\r\n     was within a few yards of the squirrel before it began\r\n     making off. The chase on land again took place, and\r\n     ere the squirrel could reach another tree, the snake\r\n     had seized it by the back near the occiput, and soon\r\n     rolled itself about it in such a way that, although\r\n     I heard the cries of the victim, I scarcely saw any\r\n     portion of its body. So full of its ultimate object\r\n     was the snake, that it paid no attention to me, and I\r\n     approached it to see in what manner it would dispose of\r\n     its prey. A few minutes elapsed, and I saw the reptile\r\n     loosening gradually and opening its folded coils, until\r\n     the squirrel was left entirely disengaged, having been\r\n     killed by suffocation. The snake then raised a few\r\n     inches of its body from the ground, and passed its head\r\n     over the dead animal in various ways to assure itself\r\n     that life had departed; it then took the end of the\r\n     squirrel's tail, swallowed it gradually, bringing first\r\n     one and then the other of the hind legs parallel with\r\n     it, and sucked with difficulty, and for some time, at\r\n     them and the rump of the animal, until its jaws became\r\n     so expanded, that, after this, it swallowed the whole\r\n     remaining parts with apparent ease.\r\n\r\nAudubon then described the appearance that the snake presently assumed,\r\nwhich suggested \"a rouleau of money, brought from both ends of a purse\r\ntowards its centre,\" and its ineffectual attempts to move off; \"when\r\nhaving cut a twig,\" he continued, \"I went up to it, and tapped it on\r\nthe head, which it raised, as well as its tail, and began for the first\r\ntime to rattle.\"\r\n\r\nNow every careful reader of this remarkable story, provided he is at\r\nall conversant with the habits of snakes, will perceive that it could\r\nnot possibly have been invented, for it is strictly and minutely in\r\naccord with facts, except in one important particular; the snake\r\nwhose behavior Audubon watched and so accurately described was\r\nnot the rattlesnake, but the blue racer or black snake (_Bascanion\r\nconstrictor_); substitute \"blue racer,\" for \"rattlesnake,\" and this\r\nrecord is photographically correct.[61] The black snake does all the\r\nthings which are here so minutely described—pursuing its prey with\r\nastounding agility, constricting about it as a prelude to swallowing\r\nit, ascending trees readily, coiling when brought to bay as if about\r\nto strike, and even vibrating the tip of its tail on the ground or\r\nleaves, as if in emulation of the genuine rattler, a kind of behavior\r\nwhich was looked upon by Darwin as a case of protective mimicry. No one\r\ncould have known the rattlesnake better than Audubon from his constant\r\nencounters with it in the field; he made drawings of it, dissected its\r\npoison apparatus, and had kept it for months in confinement in order to\r\nstudy its habits; but by some curious twist of his notes or his memory,\r\nor led astray by the record made of the rattling habit, the species\r\nbecame confused in his published account. His error was gross and he\r\npaid dearly for it, but it certainly does not prove him to be the king\r\nof nature fakirs.\r\n\r\nAudubon's critics were probably right in affirming that the rattlesnake\r\nnever ascends trees for the purpose of destroying birds, but some\r\novershot the mark by denying that the reptile was able to climb at all.\r\nNor could it have been said with greater justice that the brilliant\r\nbut sluggish coral snake (_Elaps fulvius_), which Audubon had also\r\nplaced in a tree,[62] really never aspires to this distinction.\r\nWhen the snake controversy was waxing warm in America, a number of\r\nAudubon's friends, including Colonel John J. Abert[63] and Richard C.\r\nTaylor,[64] investigated the question and proved that the rattlesnake\r\nwas a ready climber at certain times of the year and under certain\r\nconditions, a fact which is now better known. Mr. Taylor's party in\r\nthe course of explorations in the Alleghanies killed forty-one large\r\nrattlesnakes during the month of August on a single ridge bordering\r\nthe Lycoming Valley, and in rendering his report, this geologist said:\r\n\"I have repeatedly endeavored to verify Mr. Audubon's account of the\r\nrattlesnake ascending trees, which has been confirmed.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to Audubon's meeting with Thomas Cooper\r\nat Columbia, South Carolina, in October, 1833. This versatile man,\r\nsometime English lawyer, revolutionist in France, friend of Priestley,\r\njudge in the Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania, professor of\r\nchemistry in Dickinson College as well as in the University of\r\nPennsylvania, and at this time president of South Carolina College at\r\nColumbia, was able to confirm Audubon's account of the climbing habit\r\nof the rattlesnake, and probably wrote this statement at his request:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DR. THOMAS COOPER. After a contemporary silhouette.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Cooper to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          COLUMBIA S. CAROLINA\r\n          _Octr 21. 1833_\r\n\r\n          MR AUDUBON\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR\r\n\r\n     About three weeks ago, my son and two of my black\r\n     servants, observed a very large rattle snake climbing up\r\n     the fence that separates my garden from the road, at my\r\n     country house. The snake put himself in the attitude of\r\n     striking; whereupon one of the men ran for a gun, and\r\n     shot the snake on the last rail but one of the fence.\r\n     The snake was 4.3 long; as thick as my wrist, and had\r\n     seven rattles.\r\n\r\n          I am Dear Sir\r\n          Your obedient servant\r\n\r\n          THOMAS COOPER\r\n\r\nWaterton maintained that Audubon's drawing of the rattlesnake, to which\r\nwe have referred, was a monstrosity, \"a fabulous Hydra, with its eyes\r\nstarting out of their sockets,\" and a point repeatedly ridiculed was\r\nhis representation of the fangs as slightly recurved, or bent up at\r\ntheir tips. Who had ever heard of such an anomaly? Certainly not the\r\ndoughty lord of \"Walton Hall,\" who declared that the fangs of poisonous\r\nsnakes were always curved like a scythe, with their points bent\r\ndownwards. Waterton prided himself on his knowledge of these reptiles,\r\nand certainly was not lacking in self-confidence. According to his own\r\naccount, he went eleven months in the forests of Brazil without shoe or\r\nstocking to his foot, and on a certain occasion in London secured with\r\nhis hands and removed from its cage a live rattlesnake; but, like so\r\nmany sophisticated writers on natural history, he took to analogy like\r\na duck to water.\r\n\r\nWaterton's statement sounds plausible enough, but obviously could be\r\nproved only by extensive observations and comparisons. When Audubon\r\nwas proceeding up Galveston Bay to Houston, Texas, in the spring\r\nof 1837, with his son, John, and Edward Harris, they stopped at the\r\nplantation of Colonel James Morgan, near Red Fish Bar. \"There, among\r\nother rarities,\" said he, \"we procured a fine specimen of the climbing\r\nrattlesnake with _recurved_ fangs, which with several others of the\r\nsame kind, is now in my possession.\"[65] In writing to Thomas M.\r\nBrewer, from Charleston, on June 12 of this year, he alluded to this\r\nsubject as follows: \"I must not forget to say to you that I had the\r\ngood fortune to procure specimens of my 'Climbing Rattlesnake with\r\nDOUBLE _recurved fangs_' which, I am told, will prove a new genus! and\r\ntherefore the Messrs. Ord and Waterton—_good souls!_—will be perfectly\r\ndelighted at the sight of this strange reptile.\"[66] Unfortunately\r\na large part of Audubon's collections made upon this expedition were\r\nlost. I have seen no other reference to this extraordinary peculiarity,\r\nand there the matter seems to have rested until the present time.\r\n\r\nAudubon's judgment or memory might play him false, but his pencil, in\r\nsuch a matter, could be relied upon to tell the truth. It is therefore\r\na pleasure to be able to confirm his accuracy in reference to the\r\nserpent's tooth, for the true representation of which he was roundly\r\nabused during his lifetime. The reader will perceive the point by\r\nexamining the accompanying photograph, which represents the skull\r\nof a large diamond-backed specimen from Florida.[67] In the prairie\r\nrattlesnake, and probably in some others, the fangs are sickle-shaped,\r\nas Waterton maintained, but upwards of eleven species of rattlesnakes\r\nhave been found on the continent of North America, and, true to\r\nAudubon's disputed drawing and account, in this Florida specimen the\r\nfangs are _slightly_, but _very distinctly, bent upwards at their\r\ntips_! Let nature writers, inclined to the easy path of analogy,\r\nremember the rattlesnake's fang, for it teaches a salutary lesson.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: VINDICATION OF AUDUBON'S REPRESENTATION OF THE FANGS\r\n    OF THE SOUTHERN RATTLESNAKE: ABOVE, DETAIL OF THE \"MOCKING BIRDS,\"\r\n    PLATE XXI (UNCOLORED) OF \"THE BIRDS OF AMERICA\"; BELOW, THE SKULL\r\n    OF A RECENT FLORIDA SPECIMEN, SHOWING THE SAME RECURVATURE OF\r\n    FANG.]\r\n\r\nAs I have not hesitated to speak of Audubon's real or supposed\r\nmistakes, I will give another and more striking instance of his tardy\r\nvindication. In his plate of the American Swan (No. ccccxi), which was\r\npublished in 1838, there is represented a yellow water lily, under the\r\nname of _Nymphaea lutea_. Since this lily was then quite unknown to\r\nbotanists, it was ignored and treated as a fable, or as an extravagant\r\nvagary of the naturalist's imagination, until the summer of 1876, when\r\nit was rediscovered in Florida by Mrs. Mary Treat. Audubon's long lost\r\nlily was then identified and acknowledged by Professor Asa Gray, the\r\nbotanist, who, with poetic justice, proposed to rename it after the\r\ndiscredited enthusiast, in view of the fact that it had been originally\r\ndiscovered and faithfully depicted by him a generation before.\r\n\r\nWhile the snake controversy was acute in America, another of a purely\r\nacademic character, which assumed even wider proportions, was started\r\non the smelling powers of the vulture. We have already seen a reference\r\nto this in the naturalist's letter to his son, Victor, written at\r\nCharleston, where he was conducting with Bachman a new series of\r\nexperiments to settle the question.[68] The idea, commonly accepted,\r\nthat the scavengers of the Southern States were possessed of a keenness\r\nof scent comparable with that of a beagle hound, had been vigorously\r\ncombated by Audubon, who showed by numerous experiments[69] that they\r\nwere guided to their prey by the sense of sight only; thus it was found\r\nthat they would come readily to the effigy of a calf or sheep painted\r\non canvas and set up in plain view, or to a skin stuffed with straw,\r\nbut failed to detect their quarry when the dead bodies of these animals\r\nwere placed on the ground and screened from their eyes, if only by the\r\nthinnest cover, though the carrion was calling loudly to the nose but\r\na fraction of an inch away. An attack by Waterton,[70] who hurried to\r\nthe fray whenever a statement in his jealously guarded _Wanderings_\r\nwas called in question, led to a lively tilt, in which the advocates\r\nof the nose and the eyes were sometimes humorously referred to as\r\nthe \"Nosarians\" and the \"Anti-Nosarians,\" some of the most eminent\r\nanatomists of the day eventually taking part.\r\n\r\nBachman felt keenly the aspersions which were cast upon his friend,\r\nand in the winter of 1833 he undertook with Audubon the series of\r\nexperiments to which we have referred. The tests which were then made\r\nsupported Audubon's statements in every particular, and the faculty of\r\nthe Medical College of South Carolina were invited as a body to witness\r\nthem; this they did willingly, and the following memorial signed by all\r\nthe witnesses present was published by Bachman in 1834.[71]\r\n\r\n     We, the subscribers, having witnessed several of the\r\n     experiments made on the habits of the vultures of South\r\n     Carolina (_Cathartes aura_ and _C. atratus_), commonly\r\n     called the turkey buzzard and the carrion crow, feel\r\n     assured that these species respectively are gregarious,\r\n     the individuals of each species associating and feeding\r\n     together; that they devour fresh as well as putrid food\r\n     of any kind, and that they are guided to their food\r\n     altogether through their sense of sight, and not of\r\n     smell.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to Ord, on March 4, 1834, Waterton said:\r\n\r\n     You will see that the Charleston parson [Bachman],\r\n     Doctors, Surgeons and Professors are up in arms against\r\n     me and are determined to cut off the Vulture's nose.\r\n     But do not be alarmed for me, I promise you that I\r\n     will answer them to your heart's content and tomorrow\r\n     I shall send up a paper to Loudon for his May number\r\n     which will make your Philosophers appear very small and\r\n     put Audubon's claim to literature and ornithology in so\r\n     clear a light that no one will be in doubt hereafter....\r\n     Audubon's gulled friends and supporters in London are in\r\n     the highest spirits and feel sure that I cannot answer\r\n     the Charleston letter. By the first of May next their\r\n     crowing will cease.\r\n\r\nWhen anatomists came to consider the question and found that well\r\ndeveloped olfactory lobes and nerves were present in these birds,\r\nthey favored the theory of smell,[72] and Edinger has more recently\r\nexpressed the opinion that this consideration renders the possession\r\nof an olfactory sense in such birds highly probable. His contention is\r\nweakened, however, by the fact that granivorous and insectivorous birds\r\nalso possess true olfactory nerves, and yet are proved by experiment\r\nto have little or no effective sense of smell. It is a problem for\r\nstudents of behavior to solve, and so far as the American vultures are\r\nconcerned, Audubon's and Bachman's experiments, I believe, have never\r\nbeen repeated or extended with sufficient care to settle the question.\r\nThe little that has been done, however, suggests that while the vulture\r\nin its daily and never ending search for food is mainly guided by its\r\nkeen eyes, the nose, possibly, may be a coöperating factor when the\r\nwind and other conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nWhile critics were driving the pen, Audubon was hard at work in the\r\nfield, but his friends did not long remain silent. Favorable notices\r\nof his work, actual or prospective, had appeared in the scientific and\r\nliterary press of England, by David Brewster, Robert Jameson, William\r\nSwainson, and \"Christopher North\" of _Blackwood's Magazine_. The first\r\nAmerican notice appeared in the _American Journal of Science_ for\r\n1829, and this was followed by G. W. Featherstonhaugh, the English\r\ngeologist, in his recently established but short-lived _Monthly\r\nAmerican Journal of Geology and Natural Science_, to which we have\r\nalready referred.[73] A little later the London _Athenæum_ gave the\r\nfirst of eleven extended articles on Audubon's work; in reviewing his\r\nsecond volume of letterpress, which appeared in 1834, the writer said:\r\n\"There is amply sufficient remaining in Audubon's pages for fully a\r\ndozen more notices, were we disposed to follow the exhausting system.\r\nWe have admired Audubon's gorgeous drawings, but our interest in them\r\nhas been increased a thousand fold, in knowing that they are the spoils\r\nof a life's campaign.\"[74] Again a series of able articles was started\r\nby a just critic, W. B. O. Peabody, in the _North American Review_\r\nfor April, 1832.[75] Featherstonhaugh deserves credit for having given\r\nAudubon a fair hearing at a critical time, when baiting the American\r\nWoodsman was a popular pastime in certain circles at Philadelphia; in\r\nreviewing the _Ornithological Biography_ in 1832, this plain spokesman\r\ngave what he called \"a true history of a conspiracy, got up to utterly\r\nbreak down and ruin the reputation of one of the most remarkable men\r\nAmerica ever produced.\"[76]\r\n\r\nAudubon's silence under fire of hostile criticism tempted someone\r\nin the capacity of a reporter to call on him in London to obtain,\r\nif possible, a personal statement, but his lips were then sealed and\r\nhe would only say: \"Had I wished to invent marvels, I need not have\r\nstirred from my garret in New York or London.\" However, in writing\r\nto Featherstonhaugh from Bulowville, East Florida, December 31, 1831,\r\nAudubon made this comment:[77]\r\n\r\n     If I did not believe the day to be gone by when it was\r\n     necessary to defend my snake stories, I could send you\r\n     many curious accounts of the habits of those reptiles;\r\n     and I should do it, if it were not that I might be\r\n     thought to enjoy—too much that triumph which the\r\n     feeble hostility of three or four selfish individuals\r\n     has forced upon me. I receive so many acts of real\r\n     friendship and disinterested kindness, that, I thank\r\n     God, there is no room left in my heart to cherish unkind\r\n     feelings towards any one. Indeed, I am not now so much\r\n     surprised at the incredulity of persons who do not\r\n     leave cities, for I occasionally hear of things which\r\n     even stagger me, who am so often a denizen of woods\r\n     and swamps. What do you think of rattlesnakes taking\r\n     to the water, and swimming across inlets and rivers?\r\n     I have not seen this, but I believe it; since the most\r\n     respectable individuals assure me they have frequently\r\n     been eye-witnesses of this feat. I can conceive of\r\n     inducements which reptiles may have for traversing\r\n     sheets of water to gain dry land, especially in a\r\n     country much intersected by streams, and subject to\r\n     inundations, which compel them to be often in the water.\r\n     In such countries, it is not an uncommon occurrence\r\n     to find snakes afloat and at great distances from the\r\n     shore. This appears, no doubt, surprising to those\r\n     who live where there is almost nothing but dry land;\r\n     still they ought to be good natured, and believe what\r\n     others have seen. It has now been made notorious, that\r\n     numerous respectable individuals, whom duty, or the love\r\n     of adventure, have led into the woods of our country,\r\n     have often seen snakes—and the rattlesnake too—in trees;\r\n     the good people, therefore, who pass their lives in\r\n     stores and counting houses, ought not to contradict\r\n     these facts, because they do not meet with rattlesnakes,\r\n     hissing and snapping at them from the paper mulberries,\r\n     as they go home to their dinners....\r\n\r\nAudubon's most persistent heckler was Charles Waterton,[78] who during\r\ntwo of his most prolific years, 1833 and 1834, published no less\r\nthan fourteen lucubrations against the \"foreigner,\" and \"stranger\"\r\nas the American was called; all were characterized by quizzing\r\ninterrogatories, shallow criticism and personal vituperation, for\r\nthe most part unworthy of serious consideration. Long noted for his\r\neccentricities, Waterton had little or no standing among English\r\nzoölogists, against many of whom, from time to time, he issued\r\nbroadsides or breezy polemics, whenever their statements cast a shadow\r\non his _Wanderings_. Some of these accusing articles were answered\r\nby Victor Audubon and other friends of the naturalist, but they never\r\ndrew his own fire; probably they benefited him in the end, for when it\r\nappeared that the charges brought against him were in large measure the\r\nwork of envious calumniators, a strong current set in his favor on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWhen Audubon's name was first proposed for membership in the Academy of\r\nNatural Sciences at Philadelphia, it was rejected, according to report,\r\nthrough the influence of George Ord and a few of his partisans, while\r\nWaterton, who was Mr. Ord's close friend and correspondent, affirmed\r\nthat Audubon was rejected by the Society on the strength of Alexander\r\nWilson's personal diary,[79] a statement which appears to be utterly\r\nincredible.[80]\r\n\r\nIn 1833, two years after the first volume of Audubon's \"Biography of\r\nBirds\" had made its appearance, Waterton raised another controversy,\r\nin this instance with ammunition supplied by his friend, George Ord\r\nof Philadelphia. He boldly proclaimed[81] that Audubon was not the\r\nauthor of the work which bore his name, a charge similar to that which\r\nhad been brought to the door of the French ornithologist, Le Vaillant,\r\nwhose history resembled Audubon's in many ways. \"I request the English\r\nreader,\" said Waterton, \"to weigh well in his own mind what I have\r\nstated, and I flatter myself that he will agree with me, when I affirm\r\nthat the correct and elegant style of composition which appears through\r\nthe _whole of the Biography of Birds_ cannot possibly be that of him\r\nwhose name it bears.\" Waterton maintained that, while Audubon's earlier\r\npapers were the work of an illiterate person, his _Biography_ betrayed\r\nthe hand of a finished scholar from beginning to end. In a reply to\r\nVictor Audubon, written July 6, 1833,[82] Waterton declared, upon the\r\nauthority of George Ord, whom he quoted, that William Swainson had been\r\nimportuned to write Audubon's work for him, but declined when Audubon\r\ninsisted upon his own name being given to the world as author. This\r\ndirect accusation called forth an immediate explanation from Swainson,\r\nwho said:[83]\r\n\r\n     In reply to that gentleman (G. Ord, Esq.), regarding\r\n     the assistance it was expected I should have given my\r\n     friend, Mr. Audubon, in the _scientific_ details of\r\n     his work, my reply was, that the negotiation had been\r\n     broken off from an unwillingness that my name should\r\n     be printed on the title-page. I was not asked to write\r\n     the work, nor did Mr. Audubon \"insist upon his own name\r\n     being given to the world as the author\" of such parts as\r\n     he wished me to undertake.... I have read Mr. Audubon's\r\n     original manuscripts, and I have read Mr. Waterton's\r\n     original manuscripts. I think the English of one is as\r\n     good as the English of the other—but here the comparison\r\n     ends.\"\r\n\r\nThe controversy thus started did not reflect much credit on Audubon's\r\ndetractors, but reverberations of the charge were heard at a much later\r\nday.\r\n\r\nRobert Bakewell, the geologist, who was a relative of Mrs. Audubon,\r\nthen living at Hampstead, entered this controversy, and in June, 1833,\r\nreplied[84] to one of Waterton's fulminations, which he attributed to\r\nenvy and jealousy, saying that posterity would regard Audubon as \"the\r\nmost distinguished ornithologist of the present age.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Waterton began his travels at eighteen, but early settled\r\ndown to a life of leisurely independence on his ancestral estate\r\nin Yorkshire, where he studied birds to little purpose and wrote\r\nextensively on natural-history subjects; he is best known for his\r\n_Wanderings_,[85] which has passed through numerous editions and is\r\nstill read. From youth Waterton enjoyed exceptional advantages, and\r\naccording to one of his biographers, \"lived to extreme old age without\r\nhaving wasted an hour or a shilling.\" He was the twenty-seventh\r\n\"lord of Walton Hall,\" the manor house of the family, which stood on\r\nan island in a lake; the estate of 260 acres was mainly converted\r\ninto a preserve for wild birds. His young wife died in 1829, after\r\nhaving given birth to a son, and he lived on his paternal acres in\r\nsemi-retirement ever after. It was said that Waterton would never don\r\nevening clothes or a black coat, but insisted on wearing a blue frock\r\nwith gold buttons until an anxious policeman in the neighboring village\r\nof Wakefield persuaded him to make a change; he told the Reverend J.\r\nG. Wood in 1863 that he had been bled 160 times, mostly by his own\r\nhand. When, in his sixty-ninth year, he had the misfortune to fall from\r\na pear tree and break an elbow joint, the first remedy tried was the\r\nextraction of thirty ounces of blood; shortly after this a careless\r\nservant withdrew a chair as he was seating himself at table, and thirty\r\nmore ounces were immediately required. The wage of one of his laborers\r\nis said to have sufficed for his personal needs, and his sleeping\r\napartment had neither bed, chair, nor carpet; he lay on bare boards,\r\nwrapped in a blanket, with an oaken block for pillow; and he is said to\r\nhave never tasted fermented liquor and to have eaten but sparingly of\r\nmeat. His daily habit was to retire at eight and rise at three o'clock\r\nin the morning, and he was always dressed by four; an ardent Roman\r\nCatholic, he would spend an hour at devotion in his private chapel; he\r\nthen read Latin and Spanish authors, wrote his polemics against Audubon\r\nor any others with whom he came in conflict, and received the reports\r\nof his bailiff, all before breakfast, which was at eight o'clock; the\r\nremainder of the day was mostly devoted to his birds and other animals,\r\nto preserve which he surrounded his entire estate with a high rampart\r\nof stone, said to have cost, all told, $50,000.\r\n\r\nThough a devout Romanist, as someone has remarked, Waterton never\r\nhesitated to adopt the same mode of reasoning which Hume had employed\r\nin his argument against miracles. Thus he rejected with scorn Edward\r\nJenner's account of how the young parasitic Cuckoo, when but a day\r\nold and hardly able to stand, turned out of their nest its rightful\r\noccupants. This account, which was generally accepted then, and has\r\nbeen repeatedly verified and recorded by the camera since, \"carries,\"\r\nsaid Waterton, \"its own condemnation, no matter by whom related, or by\r\nwhom received.\" Trusting to analogy again, he maintained that Audubon's\r\ndescription of the Ruby-throated Hummingbird gluing bits of lichen to\r\nthe surface of its nest with saliva was false, because \"the saliva\r\nof all birds immediately mixes with water,\" and the first shower of\r\nrain would immediately undo the work of the bird. No account was taken\r\nof the Chimney Swift, which not only glues together the twigs of its\r\nnest but secures the whole to a support through an abundant salivary\r\nsecretion, although this habit had long been known. In the instance of\r\nthis hummingbird, however, both Audubon and Waterton were partly right\r\nand partly wrong, as a careful examination of the nests of five species\r\nof hummingbirds, including the Ruby-throat, has clearly shown.[86]\r\nIt proved that saliva was only casually used on the surface of the\r\nnest, the lichens in the case referred to being adherent by means of\r\nspiders' silk and fine vegetable fibers of various sorts; the saliva\r\nof the Ruby-throat, when dry, moreover, was found to be practically\r\ninsoluble in cold water, even after an immersion of several days; but\r\nmore interesting than this is the fact that the nest itself is _glued_\r\nto its supporting twig by a large _salivary wafer_, which represents\r\nthis hummingbird's first step in the work of nest construction.\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrival at Edinburgh, and before he had published\r\nanything, Audubon wrote in his journal on November 5, 1826: \"I returned\r\nhome early and found a note from Mr. John Gregg, who came himself\r\nlater, bringing me a scrubby letter from Charles Waterton,\" so it\r\nwould appear that the lord of \"Walton Hall\" had been warned to keep an\r\neye on the dangerous American, and Waterton's American correspondent\r\nwas Mr. Ord, of Philadelphia. Later on Waterton wrote to Swainson\r\nan extraordinary letter of some four thousand words,[87] afterwards\r\npublished in his _Essays on Natural History_, which for petty vanity\r\nand personal animosity has seldom been surpassed, but with this effort\r\nhis ammunition seems to have been exhausted.\r\n\r\nCharles Waterton, who lived to his eighty-third year, and who wrote\r\nnineteen polemics against Audubon and his friends, was probably sincere\r\nin his attacks upon the American Woodsman, whom he seems to have\r\nregarded as a dangerous charlatan. Waterton was a curious compound\r\nof fearless independence, kindness, credulity, pedantry, vanity, and\r\nintolerance. He should be given credit, however, for having done much\r\nto spread abroad a love of natural history and for his attitude towards\r\nan artificial system of classification, then much in vogue, which,\r\nthough only an amateur, he had the good sense to reject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSIDELIGHTS ON AUDUBON AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES\r\n\r\n     What was a Quinarian?—Controversy over the authorship\r\n     of the _Ornithological Biography_—Audubon's quaint\r\n     proposal—Swainson's reply—Friendship suffers a\r\n     check—Species-mongers—Hitting at one over the\r\n     shoulders of another—Swainson as a biographer—His\r\n     career—Bonaparte's grievance—A fortune in\r\n     ornithology—Labors of John Gould and his relations with\r\n     Audubon—The freemasonry of naturalists.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew, probably, ever attain marked success in their chosen field without\r\nexciting jealous rivalry or misrepresentation on the part of some of\r\ntheir contemporaries. Audubon was no exception to the rule, but in\r\nthis respect he has been subject to so much misunderstanding that the\r\nreader is entitled to know the truth, whenever it can be ascertained.\r\nAn instance of this sort was furnished by the English naturalist,\r\nWilliam Swainson, whose relations with Audubon have been touched upon\r\nin earlier chapters.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1828, Swainson published an eulogistic account of some of\r\nAudubon's plates, and shortly after they became good friends, as their\r\nfamiliar letters already reproduced amply testify;[88] in the autumn\r\nof that year, as we have related, they visited Paris together, and\r\nthey kept up a correspondence for a number of years. At this time\r\nSwainson was known as a systematic zoölogist of merit and an excellent\r\ndraughtsman, having published a series of \"Zoölogical Illustrations\"\r\nthat seem to have been well received. Moreover, as early as 1824, he\r\nhad adopted the notorious \"Circular System\" of the classification of\r\nanimals, and at this time was its most zealous advocate in England.\r\nThe tenets of this curious doctrine, often called \"Quinarianism\" from\r\nthe recurrence of the number _5_, was confused in a mystical jargon\r\nwhich conveys little meaning to a reader of today; it was derived from\r\nWilliam Sharp MacLeay, who had advocated a similar system in his _Horae\r\nEntomologicae_, published in 1821. According to Swainson's creed, \"all\r\nthings that have life have been created upon one plan, and this plan\r\nis founded on the principle of a series of affinities returning into\r\nthemselves; which can only be represented by a circle.\" \"This sublime\r\ndiscovery,\" which, as Swainson thought, was sufficient \"to immortalize\r\na name,\" was duly attributed to his \"illustrious countryman.\"[89]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1830, when Audubon was ready to prepare the\r\nletterpress of his mammoth plates and needed assistance in its\r\ntechnical details, he applied to his friend Swainson, who, as we have\r\nseen, was then living at a farmstead in the Hertfordshire country,\r\nnot far from St. Albans.[90] Some of the letters which passed between\r\nthe two naturalists after the return of the former to England, in the\r\nspring of that year, will now be given, without amelioration or change\r\nof any sort. It should be remembered that Swainson at this time was in\r\nan overwrought state, since he was dependent mainly upon his scientific\r\nwritings for the support of a family of five children, oppressed by\r\npecuniary difficulties, and, no doubt, irritated by lack of success and\r\nthe rebuffs which a leading part in the Quinarian movement was certain\r\nto entail. Audubon's letter[91] which follows served to answer that of\r\nSwainson, bearing date of January 30, 1830,[92] had been received in\r\nAmerica but too late for the fulfillment of its commissions. References\r\nto Audubon's \"book,\" which unfortunately proved a stumbling block in\r\nthe path of friendship, are noticed here and in Swainson's reply for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to William Swainson_\r\n\r\n          LONDON, _May 5th 1830_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR.

S.—you are mistaken, furthermore, you will be\r\n     surprised at knowing I have been fighting your battles\r\n     against a rising opposition which originated among\r\n     some of your _Ornithological friends_ (at least so I\r\n     strongly suspect) for the purpose of your name being\r\n     _blackballed_. But more of this when we meet, such\r\n     matters had better not be committed to paper.\r\n\r\n     The whole of your bundle of young trees reached me as\r\n     withered sticks, not a spark of life in any one of them.\r\n\r\n     So you are going to write a book 'tis a thing of little\r\n     moment for one who is not known, because they have no\r\n     reputation to loose, but much will be expected from\r\n     _you_, and you must, therefore, as the saying is, _put\r\n     your best leg foremost_. I am coming fast round to the\r\n     prejudice, as you may think it, against the Americans.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Richardson's and my own volume on the Arctic Birds,\r\n     is now in press. Not being able to refer to your plates,\r\n     I have not had the power to quote your work, you know\r\n     how repeatedly I have applied on this head, both to you\r\n     and Mr. Havell in vain.\r\n\r\n     Prince C. Bonaparte has long promised me his second &\r\n     third volume but they have never come. Ward[93] is a\r\n     regular _Scamp_ he has taught me a good lesson—fool that\r\n     he is—and that is, to steal my heart against distress\r\n     such as his was, and to consult, like all the rest of\r\n     the world, my own interest only. I am sick of the world\r\n     and of mankind, and but for my family would end my days\r\n     in my beloved forests of Brazil.\r\n\r\n     So Mr. Lea[94] did not settle my account with you? I\r\n     have found _him out_, also, to be no better than he\r\n     should be. He also is one of your _friends_ who would,\r\n     if he could, cut your throat. Another _friend_ of yours\r\n     has been in England, Mr. Ord and has been doing you\r\n     all the _good_ he can: if these are samples of American\r\n     Naturalists, defend me from ever coming in contact with\r\n     any of their whole race.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Swainson's health I am grieved to say, has suffered\r\n     much the last twelve months, she is now at Birmingham\r\n     with the children. I have not failed to mention your\r\n     kind inquiries after both, whenever Havell has a parcel\r\n     for me, I hope you will occasionally accompany it with\r\n     a few lines.\r\n\r\n          Yours my dear Sir very faith'ly\r\n\r\n          W. SWAINSON\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON\r\n          at MR. HAVELL'S\r\n          79 Newman St.\r\n          Oxford St.\r\n\r\nAs already noticed, Audubon started on a canvassing tour late in July,\r\n1830, as announced in the following letter to Swainson, but he changed\r\nhis plans, and instead of returning to London, went to Edinburgh, and\r\nagain settled there for the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to William Swainson_\r\n\r\n          _July 26th 1830._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n     I was particularly pleased at receiving yours of the\r\n     22nd this _morning_, I cannot well say where it has\r\n     rambled since it was dated, but certainly its migration\r\n     has not been that of a Swallow for instance.—\r\n\r\n     Thank you about the Jay—It has been my misfortune to\r\n     have been _rather_ misunderstood by you respecting what\r\n     you please to call \"Poor Nomenclators\" had I not _some_\r\n     regard for you all of that nobler breed I would not\r\n     borrow names in my work but would have like some others,\r\n     made new ones right out.—_If you have_ a new Woodpecker\r\n     from the _visited states_, a new species, I will feel\r\n     greatly honoured to have it dedicated to me, and the\r\n     more so by you who first dared _in good faith_ to write\r\n     respecting an unknown woodsman—one of my case[s] is come\r\n     to hand, I gave from it to the British Museum _thirty\r\n     skins_ several of which are very rare indeed and 3\r\n     of which I [_here a word is apparently omitted by the\r\n     writer_] as 3 new [_here another word is omitted_]—I\r\n     have males and females of the woodpecker you speak of\r\n     quite at your service for a few weeks—and I have also a\r\n     _few duplicates_ for you altogether as I promised.—Say\r\n     how I am to send them—I go to Bristol tomorrow in search\r\n     of subscribers for ten days—To Paris on the 15th of\r\n     August—have written to queen Adelaide this pleasant\r\n     morning & am glad to see that you are all well. Mr. A.\r\n     joins in respects to you all & I am as ever\r\n\r\n          your friend most truly\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON\r\n\r\n[The following note is written up the side of the page across the main\r\nletter:]\r\n\r\n     I cannot at present say When we can avail ourselves of\r\n     your kind invitation but will let you know in good time\r\n     should we but find it convenient to you when we return.—\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that the revolution in France which upset the\r\nBourbon dynasty occurred just as Audubon was leaving London, and that\r\nthe House of Orleans, in the person of Louis Philippe, was seated on\r\nthe throne the day the following letter[95] was written; very likely\r\nAudubon was not reluctant to change his plan of visiting Paris after\r\nhearing of these events, although he had enjoyed an interview with the\r\nnew king, who was his patron.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE CXII\r\n    _Bluebird_,\r\n    SYLVIA SIALIS,\r\n    _Male 1.

AUDUBON\r\n\r\n     as you was on the point of leaving London, when you\r\n     wrote your last letter, I did not reply to it. This will\r\n     probably find you returned from your excursion, and\r\n     I hope with every success, on the score of increased\r\n     subscribers, that you had anticipated, If you will be\r\n     so good as send me your specimens of the Woodpeckers\r\n     to Havell's, I shall be very glad to see them, and\r\n     they shall be returned to you after examination with\r\n     the Arctic ones. You will assist me very much by any\r\n     _Duplicates_ you can spare me, I particularly want a\r\n     pair of the Ivory billed Woodpecker, the No Am: Parrots.\r\n     Summer red birds and the Painted Buntlings also the\r\n     Pinecreeping Warbler. m & fem.\r\n\r\n     I do not expect that these most wonderful events in\r\n     France will deter you from going, seeing that everything\r\n     is now quiet. The french are certainly a great nation.\r\n     I never had such an opinion of them as I now have.\r\n\r\n     I suppose you will be at the Dinner to Cuvier on\r\n     Tuesday, when you will no doubt hear complements passing\r\n     about, and a long speech from Mr Vigors. I have neither\r\n     time nor health for such things.\r\n\r\n     Our united true regards to Mrs Audubon. In haste\r\n\r\n          very faithfully yours\r\n\r\n          W SWAINSON\r\n\r\n          J. J.

SWAINSON,—\r\n\r\n     At the time that I sent you the Woodpeckers skins, I\r\n     had not a moment to spare or be assured I would have\r\n     answered your note—When I opened my boxes of skins I\r\n     had the mortification to find most of them touched by\r\n     insects—I felt a desire that those nondescribed specimen\r\n     [s] which I had should go to a public institution & I\r\n     therefore presented them to the British Museum through\r\n     my friend Children—I sent others to New Castle upon Tyne\r\n     some to this place and some to our friends Selby & Sir\r\n     Wm Jardine.—respecting the Woodpeckers which you look\r\n     upon as knew I will merely say that if for instance\r\n     it differs from all others known by having the top of\r\n     the head entirely red that it may be a young bird, I\r\n     say this because I do not know if you are acquainted\r\n     with the fact that almost all the Woodpecker tribe have\r\n     this in their youth more or less extended but after the\r\n     first moult they assume the red in the form they are to\r\n     wear it during life. I sent you a young of the Downy\r\n     in that state—and if I recollect well also one of the\r\n     Golden Winged—had you sent me your specimen, I _think_ I\r\n     could assisted you in determining if or no it is a new\r\n     bird.—should you become satisfied on that head, and I\r\n     am honoured with its being named after me, I will feel\r\n     gratified and thankful to you.—Mrs. Audubon is with me &\r\n     we are bound to the Scotch Lakes & will return in about\r\n     2 months.—I am desirous to hear from you if you can have\r\n     the time to spare & the inclination to _Bear a hand_ in\r\n     the text of my work.—by my furnishing you with the ideas\r\n     & observations which I have and you to add _the science\r\n     which I have not_!—If it would suit you and Mrs Swainson\r\n     to take us as borders for few months when being almost\r\n     always together I could partake of your observations &\r\n     you of mine.—I would like to receive here your ideas on\r\n     this subject & if possible what amount you would expect\r\n     from us as remuneration.—My first volume will comprise\r\n     an introduction and _one hundred letters addressed\r\n     to the Reader_ referring to the 100 plates forming\r\n     the first volume of my illustrations.—I will enter\r\n     even on local descriptions of the country.—Adventures\r\n     and anecdotes, speak of the trees & the flowers the\r\n     reptiles or the fishes or insects as far as I know—I\r\n     wish if possible to make a _pleasing_ book as well as an\r\n     _instruction_ one.—In the event of my living with you we\r\n     will furnish our own wines, porter or ale.—\r\n\r\n     I hope you know me well enough to write to me your ideas\r\n     without fearing any offence done us should you find\r\n     it either disagreeable or inconvenient, indeed this\r\n     is simply to know from you if such a thing is at all\r\n     likely to be advantageous to all parties.—We leave this\r\n     on Saturday for Leeds and I will be glad to hear from\r\n     you then—I have a confounded steel pen that scratches\r\n     abominably.—Present Mrs Audubon's kind regards to your\r\n     good Lady & accept Yourself our united good wishes,\r\n\r\n          your friend\r\n\r\n          JOHN J.

AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n     I received your letter yesterday, and hasten to reply\r\n     to it. By some mistake or other, of Havell's, he has\r\n     not sent the birds to which you allude, and I did not of\r\n     course know that you had left them with him, now to your\r\n     two propositions.\r\n\r\n     First, as to boarding with us, you do not know\r\n     probably, that this is never done in England, except\r\n     as a matter of necessity or profession, in which case\r\n     the domestic establishment is framed accordingly. But\r\n     this consideration would have no influence with me,\r\n     in _your_ case did other circumstances allow of it.\r\n     It would however be attended with so many changes in\r\n     our every-day domestic arrangements, that it becomes\r\n     impossible.\r\n\r\n     Secondly, as to the proposition I once made to you, I am\r\n     fearful you have put it out of my power to do _so much_\r\n     as I _might_ have done, from your having distributed\r\n     the very birds which would have been the materials I\r\n     was to work upon; and upon which only, any scientific\r\n     observations truly original, (& therefore _worth_\r\n     putting into your book), must be founded. Fortunately,\r\n     however, my own collection is not poor in North American\r\n     Specimens, and these would still furnish a mass of\r\n     interesting information to _the Scientific_. It would\r\n     be, however, highly advisable that all these species\r\n     which I have not, but which you have brought home,\r\n     and given away, should be borrowed back again, without\r\n     delay.\r\n\r\n     Next as to plan. I have always told you that the plan\r\n     you mention, so far as your own narrative goes, is the\r\n     _very best_ which could possibly be chosen. _You_ have\r\n     to speak of the birds as they are alive, _I_ to speak\r\n     of their outward form, structure, and their place in the\r\n     great System of their Creator, for the true system, if I\r\n     have, or anybody else, has discovered is not a _Human_\r\n     System. If my views are correct, every observation you\r\n     make, _plain_, _unvarnished_, and strictly _accurate_,\r\n     will fully and perfectly harmonize. Our parts are\r\n     totally distinct, and we have no occasion to consult\r\n     with each other what we should say at every page.\r\n     Where our views may differ, I shall not, of course, say\r\n     anything. My own remarks had better be kept distinct,\r\n     in the form of \"Scientific Notes\" to each letter, at\r\n     the end, and in this way you will make the work, the\r\n     _standard authority_ on American Ornithology, which\r\n     without Science, it certainly would not be, however\r\n     interesting or valuable in other respects.\r\n\r\n     As to time, and remuneration, I shall have completed all\r\n     my portion of Dr. Richardson's works in two months. I\r\n     can then _devote_ a portion of each day to yours. The\r\n     terms of my remuneration will be those which I always\r\n     receive from the Booksellers, and which are fixed,\r\n     worth twelve guineas a sheet of the same size and Type\r\n     as the Zoölogical Journal, each sheet being 16 pages,\r\n     and each page averages 390 words, the calculation is\r\n     there brought to a nicety, and you may spend as much as\r\n     you choose. If I have to revise and correct the proofs,\r\n     make alterations etc. that will be something additional,\r\n     I always charge this by the _time_ each sheet takes\r\n     me, and would come to from 5/ to 7/6 a sheet but the\r\n     booksellers generally give me a round sum, which I name\r\n     after trying the three first sheets of a work, with Dr.\r\n     Richardson's the case was different, I there had 300\r\n     £ for my assistance and drawings. It would of course\r\n     be understood that my name stands in the title page as\r\n     responsible for such portion as concerns me.\r\n\r\n     Should we arrange this matter, it will be time enough\r\n     to fix on other minor points. But I should like to know\r\n     your decision soon, as I have been applied to in another\r\n     quarter. Indeed I am already so full of business, that\r\n     I have two years active employment ahead of me. I go\r\n     for two days to assist Burchell[97] in the arrangement\r\n     of his African Birds prior to publication, at the end\r\n     of the month, I shall bear in mind what you say on the\r\n     Woodpecker but I have peculiar notions on _Species_,\r\n     which, as I _believe_ them correct, so I do not suffer\r\n     to be influenced by others, you will see more of this in\r\n     my Book of American Birds.[98] Our kindest remembrance\r\n     to Mrs. Audubon, and always look upon me as your\r\n     sincere, but very plain spoken friend,\r\n\r\n          W. SWAINSON.\r\n\r\n     P. S. I had a long letter from Chas. Bonaparte the other\r\n     day, Vigors is gone to Rome!!\r\n\r\n          [Addressed] J. J. AUDUBON\r\n          c/o Mr. THOMAS FOWLER, Bookseller,\r\n          Manchester.\r\n\r\n          [Endorsed by Audubon:] Answered 29th Aug. 1830. J. J. A.\r\n\r\nAudubon's next letter, which was written from Manchester on August 29,\r\nmust have been distinctly provocative, to judge from the following\r\ncaustic reply[99] which it drew forth; this is dated, \"Tittenhanger\r\nGreen, 2d October, 1830\":\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Swainson to Audubon_\r\n\r\n     MY DR SIR\r\n\r\n     I have refrained from replying to your letter until I\r\n     thought you had returned to London.\r\n\r\n     Either you do not appear to have understood the nature\r\n     of my proposition on supplying scientific information\r\n     for your work, or you are very erroneously informed\r\n     on the matter in which such assistance is usually\r\n     given. Dr. Richardson, and a hundred others, similarly\r\n     situated, might with equal justice say that no name\r\n     should appear but their own; as it would rob them of\r\n     their fame, because notes are furnished by one or\r\n     two other persons, your friends would tell you, if\r\n     you enquired of them, that even _my_ name would _add_\r\n     something to the value of the \"The Birds of America\".\r\n     You pay me compliments on my scientific knowledge,\r\n     and wished you possessed a portion; & you liken the\r\n     acquisition of such a portion to purchasing the sketch\r\n     of an eminent painter—the simile is good, but allow me\r\n     to ask you, whether, after procuring the sketch, you\r\n     would mix it up with your own, and pass it off to your\r\n     friends as your production? I cannot possibly suppose\r\n     that such would be your duplicity and I therefore must\r\n     not suppose that you intended that I should give all\r\n     the scientific information I have laboured to acquire\r\n     during twenty years on ornithology—conceal my name,—and\r\n     transfer my fame to your pages & to your reputation.\r\n\r\n     Few have enjoyed the opportunity of benefiting by the\r\n     advice and assistance of a scientific friend so much\r\n     as yourself; and no one, I must be allowed to say, has\r\n     evinced so little inclination to profit by it. When\r\n     I call to mind the repeated offers I have made you to\r\n     correct the nomenclature of your birds, from the first\r\n     time of our acquaintance, and recollect the dislike you\r\n     appeared to have to receiving any such information or\r\n     correction, I cannot but feel perfect surprize at you\r\n     now wishing to profit by that aid, you have hitherto\r\n     been so indifferent about.\r\n\r\n     Let me however urge upon you one advise which, for\r\n     your own sake, I should be sorry you despised. It is to\r\n     characterize yourself, or get some friend to do so for\r\n     you, all your new species. The specimens, you tell me,\r\n     are now in England, & the task will be comparatively\r\n     easy. I urge this, because you may not be aware that a\r\n     new species, deposited in a museum, is of no authority\r\n     whatsoever, _until its name and its character are_\r\n     published. I have repeatedly set my face against such\r\n     authorities, so has Mr. Vigors, so has Ch. Bonaparte,\r\n     and on this head we are all perfectly unanimous. Unless,\r\n     therefore, this is done, you will, I am fearful, loose\r\n     the credit of discovering nearly all the new species you\r\n     possess, and this I again repeat, for your own sake I\r\n     should be sorry for. To me, individually, your not doing\r\n     so, would rather be advantageous.\r\n\r\n     The more a book is quoted, the more is its merits\r\n     admitted, and its authority established. it was on\r\n     this account I so repeatedly requested the _use_ only,\r\n     of a copy of your book, that it might have been cited\r\n     in \"Northern Zoölogy\"[100] not having it—I could not\r\n     therefore mention it.\r\n\r\n     I shall always be as thankful to you as formerly for\r\n     any information on the habits, economy, and manners of\r\n     birds; but, as to _species_, I want not, nor do I ever\r\n     ask, the opinions of any one. that is quite a different\r\n     matter, and entertaining peculiar ideas on that subject,\r\n     you must not feel surprised at my differing from you\r\n     in almost every instance. My reasons will always be\r\n     laid before the public. In the present case, we totally\r\n     differ about _species_ of Woodpeckers. I shall not,\r\n     however propitiate a favourable opinion from you, or any\r\n     one, by a compliment and therefore I will wait for some\r\n     species which you yourself will admit, which I shall\r\n     then give your name to, I am rather glad you did not\r\n     accept my offer, for I am _now_ assisting in bringing\r\n     out an Octavo edition of Wilson, by Sir W Jardine which\r\n     will be arranged according to _my_ nomenclature.\r\n\r\n          Yours my dr Sir\r\n          Very faithy\r\n\r\n          W SWAINSON\r\n\r\nThe letter just quoted naturally served as a check to their intimacy,\r\nbut Audubon did not withdraw his friendly hand, as shown by his letters\r\nto follow later, though his answer to this has not been preserved.[101]\r\n\r\nAudubon reached Edinburgh early in October, soon after receiving\r\nSwainson's decisive reply, and immediately made an arrangement with\r\nMacGillivray, as already related.[102] It is evident from Swainson's\r\nletter that when Audubon called upon him for editorial aid, he was\r\nby no means ready to defer to him wholly in the matter of naming his\r\nbirds, a subject in which Swainson regarded himself as the first of\r\nliving authorities. Swainson's pride was also wounded at Audubon's\r\napparent lack of appreciation of the weight which his name would carry\r\nif allowed to grace the title pages of his works, and he speaks of\r\nAudubon as if he were ready to bargain for scientific information but\r\ndetermined to withhold that credit which is every writer's just due.\r\nIt is only fair to say that Swainson's vanity seems to have outrun\r\nhis candor, for when the controversy over the authorship of Audubon's\r\n_Biography of Birds_ was started in 1833, he publicly denied that\r\nany such proposal had been made.[103] According to Swainson's own\r\nstatement, quoted earlier, Audubon was ready to grant him whatever\r\ncredit was due, but it is evident that he was not then disposed to\r\nadopt Swainson's peculiar ideas upon the classification of birds or to\r\nenter upon a thoroughgoing arrangement of joint authorship. Though no\r\nphilosopher himself, it seems clear that the American woodsman was by\r\nno means disposed to swallow all the vagaries of the \"Circular System\"\r\nto which his friend was committed, and which was later held up to\r\nridicule.\r\n\r\nThe craze for describing new species of animals was all too common in\r\nboth England and America at the time of which we write; the chief aim\r\nof many naturalists seems to have been to attach their names to as\r\nmany of nature's forms as possible. Swainson, who \"never went to bed\r\nwithout describing a new species,\" as Audubon said at a later time, had\r\nadmonished his friend above all else to hasten to publish descriptions\r\nof every new bird which he had obtained in America, lest he lose credit\r\nfor the discovery; but Audubon, who had not hesitated to poke fun\r\nat the species-mongering Rafinesque, was still inclined to look with\r\ndisdain upon work of this sort. He not only rejected Swainson's advice\r\nbut answered it rather tartly in the first volume of his letterpress,\r\nwhich appeared in the following year. A passage which caused the\r\nnaturalist no little annoyance on another score was as follows:[104]\r\n\r\n     Since I became acquainted with Mr. Alexander Wilson,\r\n     the celebrated author of the well known and duly\r\n     appreciated work on American Birds, and subsequently\r\n     with my excellent friend, Charles Lucien Bonaparte,\r\n     I have been aware of the keenness with which every\r\n     student of Natural History presses forward to describe\r\n     an object of his discovery, or that may have occurred\r\n     to travellers in distant countries. There seems to be a\r\n     pride, a glory in doing this, that thrusts aside every\r\n     other consideration; and I really believe that the ties\r\n     of friendship itself would not prevent some naturalists\r\n     from even robbing an old acquaintance of the merit of\r\n     first describing a previously unknown object. Although\r\n     I have certainly felt very great pleasure, when, on\r\n     picking up a bird, I discovered it to be new to me,\r\n     yet I have never known the desire above alluded to.\r\n     This feeling I still cherish; and in spite of the many\r\n     injunctions which I have received from naturalists far\r\n     more eminent than I can ever expect to be, I have kept,\r\n     and still keep, unknown to others, the species, which,\r\n     not finding portrayed in any published work, I look\r\n     upon as new, having only given in my Illustrations a\r\n     number of them proportionate to the drawings of already\r\n     known species that have been engraved. Attached to the\r\n     descriptions of these, you will find the place and date\r\n     of their discovery. I do not, however, intend to claim\r\n     any merit for these discoveries, and should have liked\r\n     as well that the objects of them had been previously\r\n     known, as this would have saved some unbelievers\r\n     the trouble of searching for them in books, and the\r\n     disappointment of finding them actually new. I assure\r\n     you, good reader, that, even at this moment, I should\r\n     have less pleasure in presenting to the scientific\r\n     world a new bird, the knowledge of whose habits I do\r\n     not possess, than in describing the peculiarities of one\r\n     long since discovered.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that Audubon did not maintain so admirable an attitude\r\ntowards the description of new species as was here expressed, but at\r\nthe close of his career in England, when he desired to make his work\r\non American ornithology as complete as possible, he appeared as keen to\r\ndescribe and publish new birds as any of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return to London in the spring of 1831, Audubon sent\r\nSwainson the following letter with a copy of the first volume of his\r\n_Biography_ of Birds, but his one-time friend was not the author of\r\nan extended and impartial review of the work, which appeared in the\r\n_Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal_ in the same year.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to William Swainson_\r\n\r\n          LONDON _April 28th 1830_ [1831]\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR SWAINSON,\r\n\r\n     We arrived here last evening & I found your favour\r\n     of the 17th instant for which I offer you my sincere\r\n     thanks—I had began to think that I was erased from your\r\n     list.—I have now the pleasure of sending you a copy\r\n     of my first volume of ornithological biography which\r\n     I hope you will accept as a small memento of the high\r\n     regard I have for your self & your talents.—My inserting\r\n     your name was not a matter merely of duty but of great\r\n     pleasure and believe when I say that I never will be\r\n     ungrateful to anyone who has been kind to me.—\r\n\r\n     We are going to Paris on Friday week & will be absent\r\n     about a month—on the first day of August next we sail\r\n     from Liverpool to America where I intend to beat the\r\n     bushes once more—my peregrinations will extend in all\r\n     probability & God willing to the Pacific Ocean into\r\n     California etc—After my return I wish to settle in\r\n     England somewhere, but where is yet undetermined.—\r\n\r\n     I have felt much grieved at reading the article of\r\n     yours respecting _French Naturalists_. I say _grieved_,\r\n     because I am always so when I see men of superior\r\n     talents employing their pen time and mind at sparring\r\n     instead of peacably giving to the world those results\r\n     of their investigations & experience at all times so\r\n     desired by everyone bent on studying the wonderful laws\r\n     & beauties of nature. I do not wish to read a _lecture_\r\n     to you but from my heart I am sorry you should be _à la\r\n     joute_ [?] with any one & will conclude by sincerely\r\n     hoping that you will have no more of this sort of\r\n     warfare.—\r\n\r\n     I am over head in business as you may well suppose after\r\n     an absence of 8 months but will be most happy to hear\r\n     from you. Have you heard from C. Bonaparte lately? Is he\r\n     still at Rome? it is now two months since I heard from\r\n     him.—\r\n\r\n     Present our united kind respects to your good Lady,\r\n     accept the same yourself & believe me your friend\r\n\r\n          J. J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n          77 Oxford Street.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that Swainson kept his promise about\r\nthe woodpeckers, and in 1831 named one, which had been obtained from\r\nLouisiana, _Picus auduboni_;[106] although Audubon later repudiated it,\r\nsaying that he believed it to represent only an immature state of the\r\ncommon Downy Woodpecker, he returned the compliment by dedicating to\r\nSwainson one of his warblers, _Sylvia_, now _Helinaria, swainsonii_.\r\n\r\nWhen William Swainson brought to a close his labors on the _Cabinet\r\nCyclopædia_ in 1840, a part of the eleventh volume was devoted to\r\na biography of naturalists.[107] In this little work Audubon was\r\naccorded a page, Alexander Wilson received eight, while the author\r\ndevoted fourteen pages to himself. The talented MacGillivray, whose\r\nmemorable _History of British Birds_ had then advanced to its third\r\nvolume, was studiously ignored, and was referred to only in a footnote\r\nas \"Mr. Gilvray\"; but he was of necessity a sharer in the following\r\ncriticism of Audubon's _Biography of Birds_: \"a want of precision in\r\nhis descriptions, and a general ignorance of modern ornithology sadly\r\ndisappoint the scientific reader.\" The technical descriptions in that\r\nwork were written, as Swainson must have known, by his young rival,\r\nWilliam MacGillivray, then one of the ablest exponents of the anatomy\r\nof birds in Great Britain; but anatomy, the master key to relationship,\r\nSwainson affected to regard with contempt, though overzealous friends\r\nhad compared him with Cuvier, one of the greatest masters of anatomy\r\nof all time. To follow the comment of a later critic,[108] Swainson\r\nprobably regarded the title of \"the British Cuvier\" as rather\r\nderogatory, since he had pronounced Cuvier to have been \"totally\r\nunacquainted with the very first principles of the natural system.\"\r\nTo Swainson, however, as the same commentator explains, \"the natural\r\nsystem\" implied the concept of a magical number and a circle, ideas\r\nwhich Cuvier would have been the first to repudiate or ignore.\r\n\r\nThe ardent MacGillivray was naturally scornful of Swainson's\r\nunscientific attitude, which he had roundly scored in the introduction\r\nto his _History of British Birds_ that had begun to appear in 1837; he\r\nthen said that Swainson could exclaim: \"How superficially do we study\r\nnature,\" while in anatomy his own studies were a century behind the\r\ntimes and his opinions on the subject worthy of the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nIn his biographical notice of Audubon, Swainson refers to their Paris\r\nexperience in the following words:\r\n\r\n     It is singular how two minds, possessing the same\r\n     tastes, can be so diversified, as to differ _in toto_\r\n     respecting the very same objects. During the whole of\r\n     Mr. Audubon's residence in Paris, he only visited the\r\n     Ornithological Gallery twice, (where I was studying\r\n     for hours, almost daily), for the purpose of calling\r\n     upon me; and even then he merely bestowed that sort of\r\n     passing glance at the magnificent cases of birds, which\r\n     a careless observer would do while sauntering in the\r\n     room.\r\n\r\nAudubon, to be sure, was never much of a closet naturalist or an\r\nadmirer of stuffed specimens; but in reading this criticism of an\r\nestranged friend, one wonders if the writer had really forgotten that\r\nwhile his own expressed desire in going to Paris in 1828 was to study\r\nin the Museum, Audubon's sole purpose was to extend his subscription\r\nlist; that after innumerable interviews with ministers of state and\r\nrunning from post to pillar for two months, his friend was obliged to\r\ncome away with but thirteen additional names or orders for his work.\r\nHad Swainson also forgotten that during all that time Audubon acted\r\nas his interpreter, assisting him in all his visits and purchases, and\r\nthat but shortly after, when hard pressed for money, he had called on\r\nAudubon for a considerable sum?\r\n\r\nAs a parting shot to his former friend, Swainson also said:\r\n\r\n     He can shoot a bird, and make it live again, as it were,\r\n     upon canvass; but he cannot describe it in scientific,\r\n     and therefore in perfectly intelligible terms. Hence he\r\n     found it necessary, in this part of his work, to call in\r\n     the aid of others; but being jealous that any other name\r\n     should appear on the title page than his own, he was\r\n     content with the assistance of some one who, very good\r\n     naturedly, would fall in with his humour.\r\n\r\nWhat was here said of Audubon might have been true in 1830, but it\r\nwas not true in 1840. Swainson could never understand that his friend\r\nwas a man who never stood still. Audubon drew heavily upon his more\r\nlearned associates, and he could give as well as take. When working\r\nunder the influence of a powerful motive, he improved as rapidly in\r\nhis use of English words as he had in the finish and composition of his\r\npictures; he soon came to write not only with fluency but at times with\r\neloquence, and the technicalities of his science did not remain to him\r\na sealed book, though for the drudgery of detailed description he had\r\nconfessedly no stomach.\r\n\r\nWe have referred to William Swainson's advocacy of the \"Circular\" or\r\n\"Quinarian\" system of the classification of animals, with him amounting\r\nalmost to a monomania, which was one of the most notorious examples\r\nof reasoning in a circle of which zoölogists have ever been guilty.\r\nIt was a serious attempt to rationalize nature in a wholly irrational\r\nmanner, and must be regarded as a curious by-product of minds fixed in\r\nthe belief of a special creation,—to whom every form of evolutionary\r\ndoctrine was sacrilegious and abhorrent. Its advocates, nevertheless,\r\nwere sincere, and Swainson probably regarded himself as a martyr to\r\nthe cause. As a later critic remarked, the system served him well by\r\ninvesting with a cloak of originality his treatises on those classes\r\nof animals with which he had little first-hand knowledge. His work on\r\nfishes is regarded as \"a literary curiosity, the appearance of which\r\nwas a misfortune to a man who, by his indefatigable industry under by\r\nno means favorable circumstances, had contributed as much as any of his\r\ncontemporaries to the advancement of Zoölogy and its diffusion among\r\nthe people.\"[109] This egregious doctrine, which its disciples called\r\n\"the natural system\" without grasping the true meaning of \"affinity,\"\r\nor \"homology,\" to use the more modern word, vitiated most of their\r\nwritings; abler men played with it for a time, only to cast it aside,\r\nand no one but a historian or a psychologist would now give it a\r\npassing thought.\r\n\r\nSo far as Swainson was concerned, Audubon's conduct appears to have\r\nbeen above reproach, and it must be regarded as fortunate that this\r\nardent \"Quinarian\" did not have a hand in the _Biography of Birds_,\r\nfor if it were really true that Audubon could have brought himself to\r\naccept the artificial system then in vogue, American ornithology, as\r\nElliott Coues remarked, escaped a great affliction.\r\n\r\nSwainson's early life affords a striking illustration of nepotism,\r\nand his later years reflected some of its disastrous consequences. At\r\nfourteen he was appointed as a junior clerk in the Liverpool Customs\r\nHouse at a salary of eighty pounds a year, to service under his father,\r\nwho had in turn succeeded his grandfather in the office of Collector.\r\nAt eighteen he received an appointment in the commissary department of\r\nthe English army and went to Sicily, where he remained eight years,\r\nduring which he worked industriously at natural-history pursuits.\r\nHaving attained the rank of Assistant Commissary-General, at twenty-six\r\nhe was retired on half-pay because of ill health. Upon returning to\r\nEngland he became a member of the Linnæan Society, in 1816, before his\r\ndeparture for Brazil, where with Henry Koster he collected birds for\r\nnearly two years. Having settled again at Liverpool, he entered the\r\nRoyal Society, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, in 1820, the\r\nyear in which he began to publish the results of his studies. Swainson\r\nwas married in 1825, but upon the death of his father in the following\r\nyear, his income so much reduced that he resorted to authorship as\r\na profession; of course he found it a poor crutch, though he worked\r\nwith indefatigable industry and produced from one to two illustrated\r\nvolumes each year. Eventually he became embittered against Audubon and\r\ntowards the world of men and things in general, especially after 1835,\r\nwhen domestic bereavement and trouble of many kinds pressed hard upon\r\nhim. He repeatedly applied to the Zoölogical Department of the British\r\nMuseum for a position which went to others; he tried to sell his\r\ncollections to the Museum and failed; he applied for an appointment on\r\nthe Civil List but was denied; then he decided to give up the struggle\r\nof authorship in England and leave the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Swainson emigrated with his family to New Zealand, where he\r\nseems to have met with no better success, although his scientific\r\nactivity did not wholly cease. Though four years younger than\r\nAudubon, he outlived him five years, dying in 1856. His excellent\r\ndraughtsmanship, tireless industry, and punctilious habits were\r\ndeserving of recognition, but he suffered from the lack of a liberal\r\neducation, and was rather too vain, too inclined to jealousy and to\r\nquarrel with his contemporaries, to have achieved great success.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n       WILLIAM SWAINSON              THOMAS NUTTALL\r\n     CHARLES L.

RUTHVEN DEANE, FIRST PUBLISHED IN \"CASSINIA\"; AND\r\n    RAFINESQUE FROM RICHARD ELLSWORTH CALL, \"RAFINESQUE.\"]\r\n\r\nIn a paragraph already quoted from the _Ornithological Biography_,\r\nin which Audubon portrayed the eagerness with which some naturalists\r\npressed forward to describe new species of birds, too often forgetting\r\nevery propriety in their eagerness to outstrip a rival, the name\r\nof his \"excellent friend, Charles Lucien Bonaparte,\"[110] had been\r\nindiscreetly mentioned. Though there was no evident intention of giving\r\noffense, this reference was keenly resented. Bonaparte, it may be\r\nrecalled, was still engaged upon his _American Ornithology_, the last\r\nvolume of which was not published until 1833, and was therefore, in a\r\ndegree, a rival of Audubon in the ornithological field. Audubon did his\r\nbest to smooth over the difficulty but with little success. In writing\r\nto his son, Victor, from New York in 1833,[111] he referred to the\r\nfollowing letter which he was about to send \"by duplicate, to try to\r\ncorrect that error\" of his early friend:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Charles Lucien Bonaparte_\r\n\r\n          TO CHARLES BONAPARTE,\r\n          Prince of Musignano, &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:—\r\n\r\n     I am sadly grieved to hear through our friend, Wm.\r\n     Cooper, of this city, that you have taken umbrage to\r\n     a passage in the Introduction to my first volume of\r\n     Ornithological Biographies.\r\n\r\n     To tell you that not even a thought of disparagement\r\n     ever existed in my mind towards you, would not be\r\n     enough. I have always repeated to all my Friends, nay,\r\n     to all persons who have ever spoken of you, of the\r\n     superior talents you possess, and of the Intrinsic value\r\n     connected with all your ornithological or otherwise\r\n     scientific productions.\r\n\r\n     I am a plain sailing man. You know full well that I\r\n     derive no knowledge from classical education, and that\r\n     being the case, connected with my being honest, I always\r\n     try to say what I think truth, at once. Could I have\r\n     praised you at one place, and attempted to lower you in\r\n     the estimation of the Scientific World at another? If\r\n     so—I would acknowledge myself unworthy the good wishes\r\n     of _any one_, much less of the good wishes of Charles\r\n     Bonaparte! the very being who brought me forward into\r\n     worldly notice by his kind advice. Nay, Nay; take me for\r\n     what I am in truth\r\n\r\n     Your Friend & ever your well wisher, as well as your\r\n     obt. Sert.\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nBonaparte was too much of a man of the world to permit such an incident\r\nto cause any sudden break in their relations. We know that they met in\r\nLondon in 1837, when, as Audubon said in a later letter to Harris[112]\r\nhe \"pumped him sadly too much\"; at his request Bonaparte then drew\r\nup a list of American birds, to the number of 425.[113] Although\r\nhis subscription to _The Birds of America_ was permitted to lapse,\r\nBonaparte's name was retained on the list to the end. When the business\r\nwas being closed up in London, however, Audubon wrote to Havell, from\r\nEdinburgh, under date of 15 May, 1839: \"As respects my _old_ Friend, C.\r\nBonaparte, _unless_ he pays the long standing balance which he owes me\r\nof £8.18.6, and also the price of the set of Nos. 81-87, _on the nail_,\r\nhe is not to receive the latter.\" Again on the thirtieth of June he\r\nwrote: \"I have no numbers for Charles Bonaparte, and no 5th. vol. of\r\nBiog. for Mr. Gould; let the Gentlemen purchase or procure what they\r\nwant where they can.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1838 Bonaparte published a paper[114] in which appeared this comment:\r\n\r\n     Throughout the list I have quoted, as types of the\r\n     species under consideration, the figures of the\r\n     great works of Mr. John Gould and Mr. Audubon on\r\n     the Ornithology of the two regions, as they must be\r\n     considered the standard works of the subject. The merit\r\n     of Mr. Audubon's work yields only to the size of his\r\n     book; while Mr. Gould's work on the _Birds of Europe_\r\n     though inferior in size to that of Mr. Audubon—is the\r\n     most beautiful work that has ever appeared in this or\r\n     any other country.\r\n\r\nA reviewer in America,[115] who could not repress his resentment at\r\nthe last remark, said: \"It would be invidious to make any comment\r\non this—to even insinuate a wonder that a personage bearing this\r\nworld renowned name would consent to resign his reputation as a man\r\nof science, through all time, to the doubtful association of such an\r\nexpression of mere professional spite.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Gould, to whom Bonaparte referred, was perhaps the only\r\nornithologist who ever grew rich at his profession. He was the author\r\nof forty large, illustrated folios, produced at the rate of about one\r\na year, on the birds of Great Britain, Europe, Asia, and Australia, as\r\nwell as those of numerous families of the tropical Orient. Audubon, in\r\nresponse to Bachman, thus referred to him when writing in London, April\r\n30, 1835: \"Gould is a man of great industry and has the advantage of\r\nthe Zoölogical Society, museums, gardens, &c., and is in correspondence\r\nwith Temminck, Jardine, Selby, James Wilson and the rest of the\r\nscientific gentry. His wife makes his drawings on stone. She is a\r\nplain, fine woman, and although their works are not quite up to nature,\r\nboth deserve great credit.\"\r\n\r\nActing no doubt upon this expressed belief, Audubon became a subscriber\r\nto Gould's _Century of Birds_, published in 1831, and also to his\r\n_Birds of Europe_ (1832-37). In the preface to the latter work, \"J. J.\r\nAudubon, Esq.,\" and twenty others are thanked \"for the warm interest\r\nwhich they have at all times taken in the present work\"; it was also\r\nsaid that the greater part of the plates of this series, those of his\r\n_Century of Birds from the Himalaya Mountains_ and his _Monograph on\r\nthe Trogons_, as well as three-quarters of those of the _Monograph on\r\nthe Toucans_, \"have been drawn and lithographed by Mrs. Gould, from\r\nsketches and designs by myself always taken from nature.\" It should\r\nbe noticed also that Gould appeared as a subscriber to _The Birds of\r\nAmerica_ in 1838, but his name was soon dropped.\r\n\r\nGould was preëminently a museum naturalist, of strong commercial\r\ninstincts, and spent but little time in the field. His books were\r\nmainly composed of illustrations made by artists from stuffed\r\nspecimens, with a text of so thin a quality as to possess little\r\nscientific value; but, as Alfred Newton has remarked, a scientific\r\ncharacter was so adroitly assumed that scientific men have often been\r\ndeceived. In his best work, that on the Humming Birds,[116] the plates\r\nare enlivened by numerous specimens of tropical flowers and fruits,\r\nan accessory not so noticeable in his early productions. It has been\r\nsaid that Gould sought and received Audubon's aid in the composition\r\nof some of his plates, and that thereafter his figures began to show\r\nmore vitality. The over-zealous writer quoted above[117] made the\r\ncharge that Gould not only received much unacknowledged aid from\r\nAudubon, but copied his drawings; he mentioned five cases of what he\r\ncalled \"picking and stealing,\" in one of which the Red-headed Pochard\r\nis declared to have been copied from Audubon's Scaup Duck: \"here the\r\ntrick is so shallow,\" he adds, \"that detection cannot for a moment be\r\nat fault. You see that the Scaup Ducks have been accurately outlined,\r\nthen lifted from the original 'grounding,' and let down upon a new one,\r\nby Gould, who found it safer for his pencil to adjust earth and water\r\ndifferently beneath them, than to tamper in the slightest degree with\r\nthe proportions of the figures themselves.\" Suffice it to say that\r\nthere is little or no substantial basis for such odious charges.\r\n\r\nGould is said to have possessed a kind heart under a rather gruff\r\nexterior. The following anecdote of his methods comes at second hand\r\nfrom his friend and collaborator, Mr. Bowlder Sharpe. Mr. Gould was\r\ninvited to dine at a well known country estate, where were gathered\r\nnumerous representatives of wealth and aristocracy. The attention\r\nof the ornithologist was soon directed from the guests to a bird on\r\nthe lawn, which he was watching intently when dinner was announced;\r\nabruptly leaving the table with the remark that dinner was of no\r\nconsequence to him when he could study a bird, he returned to the\r\nwindow and stood there munching a roll or piece of bread. Of course\r\nthe seated guests began to inquire who the peculiar individual was, and\r\nwere quietly informed by their host that it was \"Mr. Gould, the famous\r\nornithologist.\" The meal over, Gould selected a promising looking young\r\nnobleman and began to tell him about the habits of the bird which had\r\nso fascinated him; \"that species,\" he said, \"I have described in my\r\n_Birds of Europe_. Of course, you have seen my _Birds of Europe_.\" The\r\nnobleman was obliged to admit that he had not. \"Why,\" said Mr. Gould,\r\n\"you must have seen it; every country gentleman has it in his library.\r\nWon't you let me put you down for a copy?\" Naturally he could not\r\nrefuse a work which every country gentleman possessed, and down went\r\nhis name on the list; later he received the volumes and also a bill\r\nfor fifty pounds. John Gould is said to have left a fortune of eighty\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nProbably no class of men with kindred tastes are bound together\r\nwith stronger ties of good fellowship than the naturalists. Their\r\nfree-masonry extends to every clime and race, and knows no distinction\r\nof language, class or station; but, as with all serious workers,\r\noccasional jealousies or disputes occur to ruffle the serenity of\r\ntheir lives. Though we have been obliged to touch upon some of these\r\nincidents, they are nevertheless quite exceptional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nAUDUBON AND MACGILLIVRAY\r\n\r\n     In London once more—MacGillivray's assistance\r\n     continued—Return to Edinburgh—MacGillivray's character\r\n     and accomplishments—Audubon's acknowledgments—Tributes\r\n     of \"Christopher North\"—Results of overwork—Fusilades\r\n     from \"Walton Hall\"—Progress of the large plates.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudubon's return voyage, begun in mid-April, lasted twenty days, and\r\nwas one of the uneventful, \"not unpleasant sort.\" Liverpool was reached\r\nin early May, and later in the month the Audubons were again settled in\r\nLondon, where on June 1, 1834, the naturalist wrote to Edward Harris:\r\n\r\n     We found Victor at home in the evening of our arrival; I\r\n     thought that the very sight of him was a restoration of\r\n     life to me, and our happiness was as complete as it may\r\n     ever be expected on _this Earth_.\r\n\r\n     After all, I long to be in America again, nay, if I can\r\n     go home to return no more to Europe, it seems to me that\r\n     I shall ever enjoy more peace of mind, & even Physical\r\n     comfort than I can meet with in any portion of the world\r\n     beside.[118]\r\n\r\nWhile at Charleston in the previous winter, Audubon had worked\r\ndiligently at his letterpress, and no doubt, before returning to\r\nEurope had his \"biographical\" materials well in hand. We have seen\r\nthat at Edinburgh in the autumn of 1830 he entered upon a businesslike\r\narrangement with William MacGillivray to assist him with the technical\r\nportions of the _Ornithological Biography_. The part which his young\r\nassistant played in this work was long a subject of dispute, until\r\nletters of both which showed the precise character of the relations\r\nbetween them were finally published.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon his return to England Audubon again applied to his\r\nyoung friend, and received from him the following letter:[119]\r\n\r\n\r\n_William MacGillivray to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          EDINBURGH, 11 GILMORE PLACE.\r\n          _28th May 1834._\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     I am glad to hear of your safe arrival, which I did\r\n     not expect so soon, and pleased to find you in good\r\n     health and high spirits. As you have the kindness to\r\n     inquire respecting myself and family, I am happy to\r\n     inform you that we are all very well, contented and\r\n     busy. My head and hands are quite full—abundance of work\r\n     and sufficient pay—time to ramble now and then for the\r\n     purpose of hammering rocks, pulling plants, and shooting\r\n     birds.\r\n\r\n     You say you have accumulated a mass of materials which\r\n     you are desirous of seeing in print, and propose that I\r\n     should revise it as before. I shall be glad to do so, if\r\n     you please, and willing that you confer the benefit on\r\n     another, if you find it expedient. As to the terms, let\r\n     them be such as you please with respect to money; but as\r\n     time is valuable to me, I should like that arrangements\r\n     be made so as to prevent unnecessary loss of it, by\r\n     letting me have manuscripts, books, &c. in due array.\r\n\r\n     The skins of which you speak I apprehend cannot be\r\n     disposed of here to any great extent; but I believe\r\n     shells might be sold to advantage, and bring higher\r\n     prices than in London.\r\n\r\n     You ask if I draw Birds yet, with a view to publish.\r\n     My answer is that I dissect, describe, and draw Birds,\r\n     Quadrupeds, whales, reptiles, and fishes, with view of\r\n     astonishing the world, and bettering my condition. I\r\n     have about a hundred drawings, all the size of life,\r\n     excepting two dolphins. But I have determined nothing\r\n     as yet respecting publication. Some time ago a friend\r\n     of mine called on Mr. Havell with a letter in which\r\n     I desired that person to engrave for me a few of my\r\n     drawings, for the purpose of being exhibited at the\r\n     meeting of naturalists. I had no answer, and so Mr.\r\n     Havell may go to Jerico, or elsewhere, as he lists; but\r\n     further your correspondent saith not.\r\n\r\n     I am decidedly of opinion that, although you should\r\n     continue the publication of the Ornithological\r\n     Biography, you might bring out various other works which\r\n     could not fail to be popular; for example a biography of\r\n     yourself, and sketches of American scenery. But of these\r\n     matters it is impossible to speak to purpose unless I\r\n     had the pleasure of seeing you, a pleasure which I hope\r\n     I shall have at the time of the general assembly of the\r\n     naturalists.\r\n\r\n     With best respects to Mrs. Audubon, and best wishes for\r\n     the prosperity of all that bear that name, I have the\r\n     honour to be, Dear Sir, yours in sincerity,\r\n\r\n          W MACGILLIVRAY.\r\n\r\n          [Superscribed] JOHN J. AUDUBON, ESQR. MR. HAVELL,\r\n          77 Oxford St. London.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    AFTER THE ENGRAVING BY H. B. HALL OF THE PORTRAIT PAINTED BY\r\n    HENRY INMAN IN 1833.]\r\n\r\nA satisfactory arrangement was made and MacGillivray set to work on\r\nAudubon's second volume. On the 16th of June he wrote from Edinburgh:\r\n\r\n     If you send me twenty or twenty-five articles, I can\r\n     revise them without the books to which you refer, and\r\n     without your own presence, provided your descriptions be\r\n     full, and the drawings or plates sent to me. The skins\r\n     and books might be consulted afterwards, when we might\r\n     go over the articles in company. Should you come here\r\n     for the purpose, it would not, I believe, be necessary\r\n     for you to stay more than three weeks or so.... To be\r\n     methodical I should like twenty-five birds, that is\r\n     description of birds, by your first parcel; but I cannot\r\n     state precisely at what time they might be revised, only\r\n     I think were you to send them, you might make a trip to\r\n     France and be back before I should be done.[120]\r\n\r\nBy the 9th of July MacGillivray had received the twenty-five\r\ndescriptions of birds called for, and on the 18th of that month he\r\nwrote to report progress as follows:\r\n\r\n     I commenced my operations on the 1st of July, and have\r\n     transcribed and corrected eighteen articles, one _for_\r\n     each day, but not one _on_ each, the work of Sunday\r\n     being transferred to Monday. This volume will certainly\r\n     be much richer and more interesting.... You wish to know\r\n     my opinion as to the improvement of your style. It seems\r\n     to me to be much the same as before, but the information\r\n     which you give is more diversified & more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion MacGillivray urged Audubon to reduce the\r\nsize of his text, and in the letter just quoted he said: \"Had it been\r\nof the post 8vo size, in two volumes it would have gone off in style;\r\nbut your imperial size and regal price do not answer for radicals, or\r\nrepublicans either. Could you _sacrifice_ the first volume, reprint\r\nit of a small size and continue the series to the end?\" He remarked\r\nthat if twenty woodcuts or engravings were added to each volume, \"it\r\nwould spread over the land like a flock of migratory pigeons. Even\r\nwithout the embellishments it would fly, but were you to give it those\r\nadditional wings, it would sweep along in beautiful curves, like the\r\nnighthawk or the purplebreasted swallow.\" \"I have often thought,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"that your stories would sell very well by themselves, and I\r\nam sure that with your celebrity, knowledge, and enthusiasm, you have\r\nit in your power to become more _popular_ than your glorious pictures\r\ncan ever make you of themselves, they being too aristocratic and\r\nexclusive.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon kept MacGillivray supplied with materials, while he remained\r\nin London during the summer of 1834. On the 25th of August he wrote\r\nBachman that he had sold bird skins to the British Museum to the amount\r\nof fifty-two pounds sterling, and again for twenty-five pounds, while\r\nHavell had disposed of a goodly number more, so that \"he would not be\r\na loser in that way\"; he added: \"My own double collection I have in\r\ndrawers at home.\" Acting evidently upon Swainson's advice, Audubon\r\nbegan to accumulate a large and valuable collection of the skins of\r\nAmerican birds, which he brought with him to America in 1839.[121]\r\nThough rightly criticized for not having deposited in some museum\r\na complete series of the forms which he described, Elliott Coues\r\ncertainly was not justified in remarking that his interest in a bird\r\nceased from the moment he had made a drawing of it; on the contrary,\r\nhe spent no end of time and lavished large sums of money on collections\r\nto illustrate variation in every description, as well as for anatomical\r\ndissection.\r\n\r\nA hint thrown out by MacGillivray seems to have been well taken, for in\r\nthe letter just quoted Audubon said: \"This coming winter I will spend\r\nat writing my _own_ Biography, to be published as soon as possible, and\r\nto be continued, as God may be pleased to grant me life.\" As already\r\nnoticed,[122] this effort resulted only in a fragmentary sketch, which\r\nwas not published for over half a century.\r\n\r\nAudubon started for Edinburgh in September of 1834. He wrote to\r\nEdward Harris from Liverpool, on the 15th of that month, to inquire\r\ninto the truth of a report, which had circulated in London, of the\r\nfailure of the house in New Orleans \"in which our friend N. Berthoud is\r\nconcerned.\" \"I wish you would have the kindness to inform me,\" he adds,\r\n\"if he is a sufferer by this mishap, and I wish you to keep this quite\r\n_entre nous_.\"\r\n\r\nAt a slightly earlier day Audubon had entertained the idea of\r\nillustrating the birds of Great Britain on a scale commensurate with\r\nhis work on those of America, but on May 1, 1828, he wrote Swainson\r\nthat no one favored the project, and it was quickly given up. The\r\nsubject is referred to by MacGillivray, in a letter written from\r\nEdinburgh, May 7, 1831: \"As I understand your proposals respecting the\r\nBirds of Britain to have ended in nothing, and as you do not allude\r\nto the subject, I shall suppose all your ideas to have dispersed, and\r\nshall think of the matter myself.\" The first volume of MacGillivray's\r\n_History of British Birds_ appeared six years later.[123] It is evident\r\nthat he wished to obtain Audubon's criticism of some of the drawings\r\nsubsequently used in this work when he sent the following formal\r\nnote[124] to his lodgings at Edinburgh:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LETTER OF WILLIAM MACGILLIVRAY TO AUDUBON, OCTOBER\r\n     22. 1834.\r\n\r\n    From the Howland MSS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_William MacGillivray to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          EDINBURGH, _22d. october, 1834_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     I take the liberty of sending you a collection of\r\n     drawings made by myself, and intended for a work on the\r\n     vertebrate animals of Great Britain. The astonishing\r\n     success with which you have depicted a whole class of\r\n     the productions of your native land, as evinced in the\r\n     incomparable delineations of your \"Birds of America,\"\r\n     renders your opinions respecting ornithological\r\n     drawings of the very highest authority; and I have\r\n     been anxious to submit my attempts to your decision,\r\n     which, if unfavourable, will induce me to remedy my\r\n     defects, or, if otherwise, will encourage me to proceed\r\n     with an undertaking, which by its arduousness and\r\n     extent, is precisely suited to my disposition. I shall\r\n     therefore feel grateful for the expression of your\r\n     ideas respecting the Drawings, and I request that should\r\n     you favour me with it, you will not scruple to censure\r\n     freely, should you find occasion.\r\n\r\n          I have the honour to be, Dear Sir,\r\n          your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n          W. MACGILLIVRAY.\r\n\r\n          [Addressed] To J. J. AUDUBON, Esqe.\r\n          Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nAudubon and MacGillivray finished their work in November, and by\r\nthe first of December the manuscript of the second volume of the\r\n_Ornithological Biography_ was in the printer's hands. On the 10th of\r\nthe latter month Audubon wrote to Bachman from Edinburgh: \"I am quite\r\nsure I never have been half as anxious as I am at this moment to do\r\nall in my power to _compleat_ my vast enterprise, and sorrowful indeed\r\nwould be my dying moments if this book of mine were not finished ere my\r\neyes are for ever closed.\" The naturalist was thinking of materials for\r\nnew \"Episodes\" for the work when he added:\r\n\r\n     Try to study the habits of the alligator, the time of\r\n     its propagation, number of eggs, form of the nest, &c.,\r\n     &c., &c. I long to possess all respecting this reptile\r\n     (amphibian) [sic] for my article of the Wood Ibis and\r\n     Sand Hill Crane, for it will make a fine picture on\r\n     paper, and I can show Waterton the _bold_ astride of\r\n     one's bare back in great style.\r\n\r\n     By now Docr. Parkman has at least a portion of the\r\n     letter press and I hope has begun printing the second\r\n     vol. of Biog. 750 copies for America, and the same\r\n     number are printing here. I wish you would cut out from\r\n     all newspapers the pros and cons about me.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PART OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF AUDUBON'S MANUSCRIPT\r\n    FOR THE INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME II OF THE \"ORNITHOLOGICAL\r\n    BIOGRAPHY,\" GIVING NAMES OF PERSONS TO WHOM HE CARRIED LETTERS OF\r\n    INTRODUCTION ON HIS FIRST VISIT TO LONDON IN 1827. From the Howland\r\n    MSS.]\r\n\r\nWe thus have from Audubon himself a definite statement in regard to\r\nthe publication of his _Biography_ of Birds in America, and as to the\r\nnumber of copies issued.\r\n\r\nMacGillivray immediately agreed to \"revise and correct\" Audubon's\r\nforthcoming third and fourth volumes, and that he was quite satisfied\r\nwith their method of cooperation is shown by the following definite\r\nstatement of his contract:\r\n\r\n\r\n_William MacGillivray to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          EDINBURGH _15th December 1834_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     Agreeably to your request I hereby bind and oblige\r\n     myself to revise and correct the third and fourth\r\n     volumes of your work entitled \"Ornithological Biography\"\r\n     at the same rate as the two first volumes, namely at Two\r\n     Pounds Two Shillings per sheet; as well as to revise,\r\n     for a sum to be subsequently determined, any other work\r\n     which you may intend to publish.\r\n\r\n          I have the honour to be Dear Sir,\r\n          your most obedt. Servant\r\n\r\n          W. MACGILLIVRAY.\r\n\r\n          To JOHN J. AUDUBON Esq.\r\n\r\nWhen William MacGillivray first met Audubon, in the autumn of 1830, he\r\nwas an enthusiastic naturalist of four and thirty, young, but, as we\r\nhave seen, a thorough anatomist, who stood firmly on his own feet and\r\nwas destined to advance his favorite study in a notable degree. Audubon\r\nat this time was forty-five, but in anatomy the older man gladly sat at\r\nthe feet of the younger and acknowledged him master; while this young\r\nanatomist was dissecting, Audubon in the _rôle_ of student was seated\r\nby his side, and we may be sure that little escaped his penetrating\r\neye and keen intelligence. To MacGillivray, on the other hand, Audubon\r\nwas master of his art, and to him he looked for criticism of his own\r\nartistic efforts; after him he named a son, and to him dedicated a\r\nchild of his brain.[125] In short, MacGillivray looked upon Audubon\r\nas his best friend in the world, and the latter fully appreciated\r\nhis indebtedness to this able assistant. MacGillivray continued to\r\naid Audubon with his letterpress, revising and probably contributing\r\nmost of the technical details; in the fourth and concluding volumes,\r\npublished in 1838 and 1839, the large store of anatomical matter and\r\nmany excellent drawings were duly acknowledged as coming from his\r\nhand. His own writings were varied and numerous, but were generally\r\ncharacterized by a high degree of excellence. His _History of British\r\nBirds_, in five volumes (1837-1852), was too extended and too technical\r\never to become popular, but in that work, for the first time in the\r\nhistory of science, classification was placed on a strictly anatomical\r\nbasis. MacGillivray even followed Audubon to some extent by introducing\r\ninto this work \"delineations of British scenery and character,\" but\r\nunder another head. The sixth of his \"Lessons in Practical Ornithology\"\r\nrecounts in dialogue form the experiences of two friends in tramping\r\nthe Pentland Hills together; says \"Physiophilus\" [himself], \"You must\r\nhave many fine songsters in America\"; to which \"Ornithologus\" [Audubon]\r\nreplies:\r\n\r\n     That we have indeed. The Mocking Bird, of course, stands\r\n     first in my opinion, and is unrivalled. Then, perhaps\r\n     on account of my own sensitive nature, I would place\r\n     next the Wood Thrush, although the Cat Bird is far its\r\n     superior in many points, as is also the Turdus rufus.\r\n     Think of our Rose-breasted Pine and Blue Grosbeaks, how\r\n     mellow and sweet their continuous songs are, whether by\r\n     day or during calm nights. Watch the varied ditties of\r\n     the Orchard Oriole, and the loud and more musical notes\r\n     of its brother, the Golden Hangnest. You have never\r\n     heard the Tawny Thrush or the Hermit Thrush, otherwise,\r\n     believe me, you would have enjoyed much delicious\r\n     pleasure....\r\n\r\nWilliam MacGillivray was a man of the finest character and an honor\r\nto the best traditions of British scholarship; in his enthusiasm and\r\nindefatigable energy he was fully a match to Audubon. For nearly twelve\r\nyears (1841-1852) he was an honored lecturer and professor in Marischal\r\nCollege and University, Aberdeen, where he died, probably as a result\r\nof overwork in the field, in 1852, thus outliving his older friend\r\nbut one year. His last completed work, _Natural History of Deeside and\r\nBraemar_, was published under the patronage of Queen Victoria and by\r\nher command privately printed, under the editorship of E. Lancaster, in\r\n1855. MacGillivray's surviving son, whose career as a field naturalist\r\nwas also cut short by too strenuous work, accompanied Huxley, then an\r\nassistant surgeon in the Royal Navy, on the memorable voyage of the\r\n_Rattlesnake_ under Captain Owen Stanley in 1842. MacGillivray was\r\nhonored when alive, and though dead has not been forgotten; in 1890 a\r\nbeautiful tablet was dedicated to him in Aberdeen, and at the same time\r\na worthy monument was raised to his memory at Edinburgh.[126]\r\n\r\nIn authorship the public is mainly interested in seeing merit duly\r\nacknowledged. Said Audubon, in the introductory address to his first\r\nvolume:\r\n\r\n     There are persons whose desire of obtaining celebrity\r\n     induces them to suppress the knowledge of the assistance\r\n     which they have received in the composition of their\r\n     works. In many cases, in fact, the real author of the\r\n     drawings or the descriptions in books on Natural History\r\n     is not so much as mentioned, while the pretended author\r\n     assumes to himself all the merit which the world is\r\n     willing to allow him. This want of candour I could\r\n     never endure. On the contrary, I feel pleasure in here\r\n     acknowledging the assistance which I have received from\r\n     a friend, Mr. William MacGillivray, who being possessed\r\n     of a liberal education and a strong taste for the study\r\n     of the Natural Sciences, has aided me, not in drawing\r\n     the figures of my Illustrations, nor in writing the book\r\n     now in your hand, although fully competent for both\r\n     tasks, but in completing the scientific details, and\r\n     in smoothing down the asperities of my Ornithological\r\n     Biographies.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to Volume IV he added that the\r\n\r\n     anatomical descriptions, as well as the sketches by\r\n     which they are sometimes illustrated, have been executed\r\n     by my learned friend, William MacGillivray, who in the\r\n     most agreeable manner consented to undertake the labour,\r\n     by no means small, of such a task, and to whom those\r\n     who are interested in the progress of Ornithological\r\n     science, as well as myself, must therefore feel\r\n     indebted.\r\n\r\nAudubon evidently believed that this printed acknowledgment was just;\r\nMacGillivray was as plainly satisfied, so that complaints which have\r\nbeen made against the naturalist on this score seem to have been\r\nrather groundless. It might be noticed that bookmaking at that time\r\nwas regarded as more of a trade than at present; as Sir Walter Besant\r\nremarks, a traveler would often give his notes to a bookseller, who in\r\nturn would hand them over to a literary hack to be cast into suitable\r\nform.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUDUBON'S INSCRIPTION IN THE COPY OF THE\r\n    \"ORNITHOLOGICAL BIOGRAPHY\" PRESENTED TO WILLIAM MACGILLIVRAY]\r\n\r\nA fine token of the friendship which existed between these two men was\r\ndiscovered in the summer of 1903 in a London bookshop, where it was\r\nfound reflected in the pages of a handsomely bound copy of Audubon's\r\n_Biography of Birds_; on the title pages were inscribed the autographs\r\nof William MacGillivray, while on the first page of the introduction to\r\nthe first volume the hand of Audubon had written this dedication:\r\n\r\n     These volumes are presented to William MacGillivray with\r\n     sentiments of the highest esteem and best wishes by his\r\n     truly and sincerely attached friend\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON\r\n\r\n          Edinburgh July 1 t 1839.\r\n\r\nProfessor John Wilson gave the third volume of the _Ornithological\r\nBiography_ a very handsome notice in _Blackwood's Magazine_, and on New\r\nYear's Day, 1836, Audubon acknowledged the compliment in the following\r\nletter:[127]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to John Wilson_ (\"_Christopher North_\")\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND:—\r\n\r\n     The first hour of this new year was ushered to me\r\n     surrounded by my dear flock, all comfortably seated\r\n     around a small table in middle-sized room, where I\r\n     sincerely wished you had been also, to witness the\r\n     flowing gladness of our senses, as from one of us\r\n     \"Audubon's Ornithological Biography\" was read from your\r\n     ever valuable Journal. I wished this because I felt\r\n     assured that your noble heart would have received our\r\n     most grateful thanks with pleasure, the instant our\r\n     simple ideas had conveyed to you the grant of happiness\r\n     we experienced at your hands. You were not with us,\r\n     alas! but to make amends the best way we could, all of\r\n     a common accord drank to the health, prosperity, and\r\n     long life, of our generous, talented, and ever kind\r\n     friend, Professor John Wilson, and all those amiable\r\n     beings who cling around his heart! May those our\r\n     sincerest wishes reach you soon, and may they be sealed\r\n     by Him who granted us existence, and the joys heaped\r\n     upon the \"American woodsman\" and his family, in your\r\n     hospitable land, and may we deserve all the benefits we\r\n     have received in your ever dear country, although it\r\n     may prove impossible to us to do more than to be ever\r\n     grateful to her worthy sons.\r\n\r\n     Accept our respectful united regards, and offer them to\r\n     your family, whilst I remain, with highest esteem, your\r\n     truly thankful friend and most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nWilson had said in his earlier review:\r\n\r\n     We do not believe that till within these few years,\r\n     he had any practice in composition.... Yet Genius,\r\n     if from circumstances behindhand in any common\r\n     accomplishment, soon supplies it—soon makes up its\r\n     lee-way—or rather, it has only to try to do what it has\r\n     never done before, and it succeeds in it to admiration.\r\n     Audubon, who had written but little even in his native\r\n     tongue—French—under a powerful motive, took to writing\r\n     English; and he was not long in learning to write it\r\n     well, not only with fluency, but eloquence, as the fine\r\n     extracts we have quoted show in unfading colours.\r\n\r\nThe following comment on Audubon's second volume of the _Biography_\r\nappeared in the _Athenæum_ for 1835:\r\n\r\n     If only considered as evidence that it is in the power\r\n     of man to achieve whatever he _wills_, and that no\r\n     obstacles are too great to be overcome by energy and\r\n     devotion of purpose, it would claim our good will and\r\n     best wishes.\r\n\r\n     He has told what he has seen and undergone, not perhaps\r\n     in the smooth nicely balanced periods of a drawing-room\r\n     writer ... but with unstudied freedom, rising at times\r\n     to eloquence, nor been ashamed to utter the thousand\r\n     affectionate and benevolent feelings which a close and\r\n     enthusiastic communion with nature must nourish. The\r\n     work is full of the man.\r\n\r\nThe winter and spring of 1835 were spent in London, and though\r\nsuffering from the strain of overwork, Audubon kept doggedly at his\r\ntasks. On April 20 he wrote to Bachman:\r\n\r\n     Immediately on my arrival in London I set to writing,\r\n     and finished in one month, one 4th. of the Biographies\r\n     of my 3d. vol. This rendering me _puffy_, I could\r\n     scarcely breathe—my appetite was gone—my digestion\r\n     bad—in other words I was attacked by Dyspepsia as bad as\r\n     ever. Then I thought of a change of work—for in change\r\n     of labour the body and the mind undergo sure and certain\r\n     relief. I took to Drawing! and what do you think—I have\r\n     positively finished 33 drawings of American birds in\r\n     England. This has enabled me to swell my 3d. vol. of\r\n     Illustrations with 57 species not given by Wilson and\r\n     therefore forestalling my friend Charles Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of April Audubon wrote to Edward Harris, begging him\r\nto send specimens of certain birds which he needed, as well as a\r\ncircumstantial account of the shad fisheries of the Delaware River\r\nas material for an \"Episode\" for the third volume of his _Biography_;\r\nthe fiftieth number of his illustrations was then in the hands of the\r\ncolorist. He continued:[128]\r\n\r\n     I thought better to push my publication on account of\r\n     the woeful dulling of the times in this country, where\r\n     political strife engrosses the mind of every person so\r\n     much that arts and sciences are, as it were, put on\r\n     the shelves. Ministers are beings of six weeks lives\r\n     now-a-days. The Reformers are struggling against the\r\n     Tories, and vice versa. The Churchmen are aghast at the\r\n     prospect of the future, and all this puts a complete\r\n     stoppage to business, independent of such matters. Even\r\n     since my return to England I have obtained only two or\r\n     three subscribers, and have lost more than a dozen;\r\n     nay, I may safely say, two dozen. In America, on the\r\n     contrary, things appear to go on more prosperously.\r\n     May God's will grant a long continuation of this to our\r\n     _only Land_ of Liberty. France, you will have heard, has\r\n     at last passed an order for the payment of her debts\r\n     to the citizens of the United States, and I hope that\r\n     this may prove amply sufficient to save us from having\r\n     a war with that powerful nation.... I wrote you that\r\n     Dr. George Parkman, of Boston, would have my 2d. volume\r\n     of Biographies reprinted in his city. I have seen 100\r\n     pages of this reprint here, but do not know if the Vol.\r\n     (American Ed.) has appeared before the Public?\r\n\r\n     My—Friends—erton, Ord & Co. keep up their curious\r\n     animadversions against me still—methinks they must\r\n     be shockingly mortified at my stubborn silence toward\r\n     them. Some unknown friends now & then reply to their\r\n     absurdities.\r\n\r\nHis persistent heckler, Charles Waterton, was quite busy at this time,\r\nfour articles having been directed against Audubon or his friends in\r\n1835, though this was not his most prolific year. A similar reference\r\noccurs in a letter written to Bachman from Edinburgh on the 20th of\r\nJuly: \"As to the rage of Mr. Waterton, or the lucubrations of Mr. Neal,\r\nwho by the bye is a subscriber to the Birds of America (bona fide), I\r\nreally care not a fig—all such stuffs will soon evaporate, being mere\r\nsmoke from a Dung Hill.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1835 Audubon was again established in Edinburgh and\r\nworking with unremitting vigor at his _Biography_; some idea of the\r\nspeed which he maintained when able to devote himself unreservedly to\r\nthis task can be gathered from the fact that after the issue of his\r\nsecond volume, of 620 large pages, in December, 1834, the third, of 654\r\npages, was published in just a year from that time. He wrote to Edward\r\nHarris from Edinburgh on the 5th of July, when engaged in this work:\r\n\r\n     I intend to write a few [\"Episodes\"] of such\r\n     extraordinary men, now deceased, with whom I have been\r\n     acquainted—Thomas Bewick, and Baron Cuvier, for example.\r\n\r\n     We receive no new subscribers in Europe. The taste\r\n     is passing for Birds like a flitting shadow—Insects,\r\n     reptiles and fishes are now the rage, and these fly,\r\n     swim or crawl on pages innumerable in every Bookseller's\r\n     window. When this is also passed, naturalists will\r\n     have to turn over a new leaf and commence afresh, or go\r\n     to the antipodes in search of materials to please the\r\n     taste for novelty's sake.—However my work will I hope be\r\n     finished ere I leave this world, and must be appreciated\r\n     in years to come, when perhaps my childrens' children\r\n     will feel proud of their gone ancestor, \"The American\r\n     Woodsman.\" You see my Dear Friend how far enthusiasm\r\n     and a portion of the like for standing fame carries\r\n     even your humble servant a man with no other means\r\n     than his industry and prudence as a means of support,\r\n     and one with scarce the motive of education. There are\r\n     moments, and they are not far between, when thinking\r\n     of my present enormous undertaking, I wonder how I have\r\n     been able to support the extraordinary amount of monies\r\n     paid for the work alone, without taking cognizance\r\n     of my family and my expeditions, which ever and anon\r\n     travelling as we are from place to place and country\r\n     to country are also very great. When I publish my Life\r\n     and let the world know that Audubon like Wilson, was at\r\n     Phila. without the half of a Dollar, and that had it not\r\n     been for benevolent generosity of a certain Gentleman\r\n     whose name is Edward Harris, Audubon must have walked\r\n     off from one of the fairest of our Cities like a beggar\r\n     does in poor Ireland, left destitute of all things save\r\n     his humble talents, and his determination to produce\r\n     something worthy of the soul of man: I say my dear\r\n     Harris will not the world stare! Poor Wilson was only\r\n     better off than I on account of his superior talents\r\n     over me at driving the goose quill, but much similarity\r\n     still seems to have [existed] in both of us, as I could\r\n     drive the pencil, the brush, the Fiddle bow and even the\r\n     \"Fleuret\" [better] than he.\r\n\r\nAudubon wrote to Harris again from Edinburgh, on September 5, when he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Between you and I the measurements of different Birds\r\n     given by Wilson are hardly to be depended upon, as I\r\n     constantly discover a great deficiency in this part\r\n     of his descriptions which indeed in some cases are\r\n     otherwise slack, and given as if when fatigued or vexed.\r\n     Nay I even think at times that he has copied _Authors_\r\n     and not nature? as in the instance of the Oyster\r\n     Catcher, which I fear he made & figured from a European\r\n     one in the Philadelphia museum, took the descriptions\r\n     from _Latham_, and described the Habits of Palliartus\r\n     which is our own Bird and it seems the only species\r\n     to be met with in America, at least on our Atlantic\r\n     coast. Wilson committed the same blunder with the Rallus\r\n     elegans which he _figured_ and described the habits of\r\n     the R. capitans for it! I could enumerate more instances\r\n     of carelessness, but poor Wilson is dead and may God\r\n     bless his soul!\r\n\r\nThe third volume of his letterpress,[129] which dealt with the water\r\nbirds of America, made its appearance at the close of 1835; in the\r\nintroduction he said:\r\n\r\n     I look forward to the summer of 1838 with an anxious\r\n     hope that I may then be able to present you with the\r\n     last plate of my Illustrations, and the concluding\r\n     volume of my Biographies. To render these volumes as\r\n     complete as possible, I intend to undertake a journey to\r\n     the southern and western limits of the Union, with the\r\n     view of obtaining a more accurate knowledge of the birds\r\n     of those remote and scarcely inhabited regions. On this\r\n     tour I shall be accompanied by my youngest son, while\r\n     the rest of my family will remain in Britain to direct\r\n     the progress of my publication.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: EARLY UNPUBLISHED DRAWINGS OF AMERICAN BIRDS: ABOVE,\r\n    \"CAPRIMULGUS VOCIFERUS.

Jeanes.]\r\n\r\nAudubon returned to London with his family early in 1836, visiting\r\nNewcastle, York, Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield by the way, and took a\r\nhouse at Number 4, Wimpole Street, Cavendish Square. As Mrs. Audubon's\r\nhealth was anything but good, they were fortunate in having as a\r\nneighbor in this street an eminent surgeon, Benjamin Phillips,[130] and\r\nthis friend was also a subscriber to _The Birds of America_. \"Were I to\r\nmention,\" said Audubon,\r\n\r\n     the many occasions on which he has aided me by his\r\n     advice and superior knowledge of the world, you would\r\n     be pleased to find so much disinterestedness in human\r\n     nature. His professional aid too, valuable as it has\r\n     proved to us, and productive of much inconvenience to\r\n     him, has been rendered without reward, for I could never\r\n     succeed in inducing him to consider us his patients,\r\n     although for upwards of two years he never passed a day\r\n     without seeing my wife.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1836 Audubon's two sons made a tour of France and\r\nItaly; on the 9th of March he wrote to Harris that they expected\r\nto leave England in a week, be gone three and a half months, visit\r\nParis, Rome and Messina, and return by way of Marseilles and Paris.\r\nWith the passage of 1836 he had completed 70 numbers, of 350 plates,\r\nof his larger work, leaving but 85 plates yet to be engraved. Though\r\nanxious to see this greatest of his tasks brought to an end, he still\r\nlooked with longing eyes to the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast,\r\nand began preparations for his last journey to obtain materials and\r\nsubscribers in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHIRD AMERICAN TOUR, 1836-1837\r\n\r\n     In New York harbor—Collections from the Far\r\n     West—Audubon's efforts to secure them—Return to\r\n     Boston—Friendship of Daniel Webster—Renewed efforts to\r\n     obtain the Nuttall-Townsend collection—Expedition to the\r\n     west coast of Florida—Deferred governmental aid—Another\r\n     winter with Bachman—Overland journey to New Orleans—On\r\n     board the _Crusader_—Mistaken for pirates—With Harris\r\n     and his son explores the Gulf Coast—The Republic of\r\n     Texas—Visit to its capital and president—Meeting in\r\n     Charleston—Marriage of his son—Their return to England.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudubon left London with his son, John, July 30, 1836, and on the\r\nsecond day of August sailed from Portsmouth on the packet _Gladiator_,\r\nbound for New York. Two hundred and sixty live birds had preceded\r\nthem to the ship, while three dogs came as a present from the Earl of\r\nDerby, and \"a brace of tailless cats from our friend George Thackeray,\r\nD.D., provost of King's College\": all had suffered somewhat from\r\nlack of care, but the dogs, one of which was sent to John Bachman of\r\nCharleston, and some of the birds crossed the Atlantic in safety. Five\r\nweeks were spent at sea; when the Navesink Highlands at last hove into\r\nview the welcome news spread rapidly over the ship; rockets were sent\r\nup later to attract a pilot, and when anchor was grounded on American\r\nsoil, Audubon confessed that he cried like a child and devoutly thanked\r\nGod for their preservation. He continued:\r\n\r\n     All was now bustle and mutual congratulations; our\r\n     commander was praised for his skill by some, and others\r\n     praised his whisky, which the waiters handed about,\r\n     and the night was nearly spent in revelry; but John\r\n     and myself retired at two o'clock.... As a gleam of\r\n     daylight appeared, my eyes searched through the hazy\r\n     atmosphere to catch a glimpse of the land, and gradually\r\n     Staten Island opened to my view; then the boat of the\r\n     custom-house appeared, and soon he boarded us, arranged\r\n     the sailors and passengers on deck, and called their\r\n     names. Then followed breakfast, and soon another boat,\r\n     with a yellow flag flying, landed the health officer,\r\n     and there being no sickness on board, myself and John\r\n     returned to Staten Island in the doctor's boat, and were\r\n     taken by the steamer Hercules to the city.[131]\r\n\r\nAudubon remained in New York from the 7th to the 13th of September. On\r\nSunday, the 12th, he wrote to Edward Harris, in part as follows:[132]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Edward Harris_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND—\r\n\r\n     ... Whilst running over the interesting list of the\r\n     Species of Birds procured by Nuttall & Townsend in\r\n     the Rocky Mountains, and the shores of the Pacific, I\r\n     became so completely wrapt up with the desire to see\r\n     these as soon as possible that I have concluded to go\r\n     to Philadelphia tomorrow by the 10 o'clock boat. I will\r\n     stay at Harlan's for two or three days and hope that\r\n     you will meet me there, that I may have the pleasure of\r\n     pressing your hand and talking to you.\r\n\r\n     You well know how anxious I am to make my work on the\r\n     Birds of our Country as compleat as possible within my\r\n     power:—you know that to reach this end I have spared\r\n     neither time, labours or money: you are also aware that\r\n     although this undertaking may never remunerate me, I am\r\n     so enthusiastic as to indulge in the hope that God will\r\n     grant me life to effect all this; but I am becoming old,\r\n     and though very willing doubt whether I could support\r\n     the fatigues connected with a journey of several years,\r\n     and separated from my dear Family. Well the desiderata\r\n     has come to Philadelphia at least in part, and if I\r\n     could be allowed to pourtray the new species now there\r\n     as an appendix to the Birds of America, I should be\r\n     proud and happy to do so, but do you think that the\r\n     Academy is likely to indulge me in this my wish? Do\r\n     join me at Harlan's as soon as you can, and lend me a\r\n     hand and try to promote my views through mutual Friends\r\n     attatched to that Institution.\r\n\r\nAudubon also communicated at once with John Bachman, whom he had\r\nplanned to visit on his journey south, but soon learned that the\r\ncholera had broken out in Charleston and that the Seminoles were on the\r\nwarpath in Florida. Said Bachman, writing on September 14:\r\n\r\n     With regard to Florida, nothing will be done by\r\n     naturalists for at least two years. Your Indian friends,\r\n     the cut-throats, have scalped almost every woman and\r\n     child south of St. Augustine, save those on Key West.\r\n     They have burnt and plundered every plantation; and\r\n     although they will probably be, in a great measure, put\r\n     down next winter, yet there will, undoubtedly, remain\r\n     many small predatory bands that will make no bones of\r\n     scalping at Ornithologist _secundum artem_; and would\r\n     ask no questions whether he were the friend or enemy\r\n     of William Penn. Of Texas, I think better, and thither,\r\n     or along its borders, you may, I think, venture—for the\r\n     Texans are our friends. I suppose Genl. Gaines will keep\r\n     the Comanches quiet.[133]\r\n\r\nBachman kept his friends informed of the progress of the epidemic,\r\nwhich had placed an embargo over his city; at the same time he sent\r\nnews of the Anhingas, Caracara Eagles and Cormorants, which had\r\nbeen successfully held in captivity for the naturalist, and added:\r\n\"These are awful times in money matters, but of this you will hear\r\nenough when we meet. Everyone nearly has failed, but the Parsons and\r\nOrnithologists.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 13 Audubon started for Philadelphia, anxious to see\r\nwith his own eyes those western collections which had so stirred his\r\ncuriosity. It seems that in 1834, Dr. Thomas Nuttall and Dr. John Kirk\r\nTownsend set out on a journey to the mouth of the Columbia River;\r\nNuttall was first of all a botanist, and is said to have carried no\r\ngun, but Townsend was an experienced ornithologist and made extensive\r\ncollections of birds, a part of which he sent in care of Nuttall to\r\nPhiladelphia in 1835, although he himself did not return east until the\r\nclose of 1837. One of Audubon's great ambitions had been to explore the\r\nregions which they had recently visited, and in the circumstances we\r\ncan sympathize with his desire to acquire so valuable an acquisition\r\nfor the work upon which he had been long engaged. The object of his\r\nimmediate quest apparently had been entrusted to the Academy of Natural\r\nSciences, an institution which had not always shown itself friendly\r\nto his claims, and which in this instance is said to have assisted\r\nthe travelers with funds to prosecute their journey. The collection,\r\nsaid Audubon, contained \"about forty new species of birds, and its\r\nvalue cannot be described.\" Balked in his initial efforts to obtain\r\nthe coveted prize, after two days of fruitless efforts on the part of\r\nhis Philadelphia friends, he returned to New York; Edward Harris then\r\ncame forward with the offer of $500 for the purchase of the collection\r\noutright, but negotiations were not immediately successful.\r\n\r\nWith his hunger still unappeased, Audubon now visited Boston on a\r\ncanvassing tour, while his son remained with Nicholas Berthoud at New\r\nYork. Setting out on the 20th of September, he traveled by the steamer\r\n_Massachusetts_ and the Providence Railroad, paying seven dollars fare,\r\n\"which included supper and breakfast\"; the sail up Providence Bay in\r\nearly morning was like a \"fairy dream,\" and the locomotive in waiting\r\nthen pulled the passengers from \"Providence to Boston at the rate of\r\nfifteen miles an hour.\" We arrived, said he, at four in the afternoon:\r\n\"a cart took my trunk, and placing myself by the side of the owner, we\r\ndrove to the house of my friend, Dr. George C. Shattuck.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day after his arrival, Audubon visited Thomas M. Brewer, then\r\na young ornithologist living at Roxbury, to examine his collection\r\nof bird skins and eggs, and upon his return called on David Eckley,\r\n\"the great salmon fisher,\" to whom he later presented a copy of his\r\nfolio plates of _The Birds of America_.[134] Brewer, who later became\r\na physician and distinguished ornithologist, for many years was one of\r\nAudubon's valued correspondents and supplied him with much interesting\r\nmaterial. On the following day Audubon met Thomas Nuttall,[135] who at\r\nonce promised him duplicates of all the new birds which he had brought\r\nfrom the West. Colonel Thomas H. Perkins, an early subscriber, Edward\r\nEverett, who had befriended him in Washington, and who in 1836 became\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts, Josiah Quincy, president of Harvard College,\r\nDr. Bowditch, and other prominent characters, all extended a helping\r\nhand. He visited Salem to deliver his letters, and was successful in\r\nobtaining a number of subscribers; upon invitation of the curator of\r\nthe Natural History Society there, he examined \"the young collection\r\nof that newborn institution,\" and had \"the good fortune to find one\r\negg of the American bittern.\" On the 25th of September he wrote Harris:\r\n\"Nuttall has arrived—he breakfasted with me the other day—gave me 6 new\r\nspecies of Birds and tells me that he will urge both Townsend and the\r\nSociety at Philadelphia to allow me to portray all the species which\r\nthey have procured within the limits of our Territories.\"\r\n\r\nIn Boston, September 27, 1836, Audubon made this note in his\r\njournal:[136] \"The citizens are all excitement; guns are firing, flags\r\nflying, and troops parading and John Quincy Adams is delivering a\r\neulogy on the late President Madison. The mayor of Boston did me the\r\nhonor to invite me to join in the procession, but I am no politician\r\nand declined.\" He noted on the same day also that Dr. Shattuck had\r\ncompleted the subscription list of the Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory \"by presenting me to his lady, who subscribed for one-tenth,\r\nand the Dr. then put down his son George's name for one-twentieth,\r\nmaking his own family one-fourth of the whole, or two hundred and\r\ntwenty dollars, for which he gave me his cheque. Without the assistance\r\nof this generous man, it is more than probable that the Society never\r\nwould have had a copy of 'The Birds of America.'\" Two days later he\r\nmet Daniel Webster at the rooms of the Historical Society, and on the\r\nsame evening at the home of Isaac P. Davis, where, said Audubon, \"we\r\ntook tea, talked on ornithology and ornithologists; he promised to send\r\nme some specimens of birds, and finished by subscribing to my work.\"\r\nWebster also gave him a general note of recommendation, in which he\r\nsaid:[137] \"I take this mode of commending Mr. Audubon to any friends\r\nof mine he may meet in his journey to the west. I have not only great\r\nrespect for Mr. Audubon's scientific pursuits, but entertain for him\r\npersonally much esteem and hearty good wishes.\" Mr. Davis exerted\r\nhis influence in other directions, and in this instance acted as\r\nagent for the transmission of Audubon's plates to their distinguished\r\nfriend; on October 7, he wrote:[138] \"I received the half Nos of the\r\n'Birds of America' for the worthy and sublime Danl. Webster—they shall\r\nbe delivered safely on his return.\" After urging Audubon to visit\r\nBuffalo, where Dr. Bowditch and his friends thought that a number of\r\nnew subscribers might be procured, he appended a list of twelve likely\r\nnames of residents of that city, and added: \"Bowdoin College shall be\r\nremembered as the opportunity offers.\"\r\n\r\nWebster, who was an ardent sportsman and well acquainted with the water\r\nfowl of the coast, had volunteered to procure for Audubon specimens of\r\nthe Labrador Duck, which was even then extremely rare and has since\r\nbecome extinct, but was unable to fulfill his promise. Audubon had\r\nalready found that many American birds, like the common crow, which had\r\nbeen regarded as identical with those of the Old World, were in reality\r\ndistinct, and was now anxious, as he wrote to Thomas Brewer, \"to\r\ncompare the anatomy of all our birds with those of the same families\r\nin Europe.\" His letters to young Brewer at this time show how eager\r\nhe was to secure the promised specimens. On October 23 he wrote from\r\nPhiladelphia: \"I hope you will not forget to call on our enlightened\r\nstatesman D. Webster, and remind him of his kind promise to assist\r\nyou in the procuring of specimens for me. This winter and next spring\r\nare my only chances, and I beg you to do all you can for me.\" He wrote\r\nagain from Charleston, January 1, 1837: \"I am sorry that the Hon. D.\r\nWebster has not attended to his promises, and will write to him; yet I\r\nwould beg you, being on the spot, _to trouble him a good deal_.\"[139]\r\n\r\nAfter returning to New York, Audubon had a visitor for whom he\r\nexpressed the greatest admiration, Washington Irving, who had aided\r\nhim in 1833; he now received from his hands letters to Martin Van\r\nBuren, the President-elect, and Benjamin F. Butler, who then occupied\r\nthe post of Attorney-General. Irving called attention in his letter\r\nto the national character of Audubon's work, and warmly commended it\r\nto the patronage of the country at large. On October 8 Audubon wrote\r\nMacGillivray from New York that he had obtained twelve new subscribers,\r\ntwo at Salem, four at Boston, and six in New York, but a little later,\r\nthrough the aid of Nicholas Berthoud, in one week's time eighteen new\r\nnames were added to his subscription list in New York City alone.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Nuttall's and Townsend's birds had not been forgotten, and\r\non October 15 he started with his son for Philadelphia, where he was\r\nagain welcomed by Dr. Richard Harlan. No sooner, however, were efforts\r\nrenewed to gain permission to study the desired objects than new\r\nobstacles were encountered. To quote the naturalist:[140]\r\n\r\n     Having obtained access to the collection sent by Dr.\r\n     Townsend, I turned over and over the new and rare\r\n     species, but he was absent at Fort Vancouver, on the\r\n     shores of the Columbia River; Thomas Nuttall had not\r\n     yet come from Boston, and loud murmurs were uttered by\r\n     the _soi-disant_ friends of science, who objected to\r\n     my seeing, much less portraying and describing, those\r\n     valuable relics of birds, many of which had not yet been\r\n     introduced into our Fauna.\r\n\r\nAt length, \"it was agreed,\" to continue his account of the transaction,\r\n\r\n     that I might _purchase duplicates, provided_ the\r\n     specific names agreed upon by Mr. Nuttall and myself\r\n     were published in Dr. Townsend's name. This latter part\r\n     of the affair was perfectly agreeable to my feelings, as\r\n     I have seldom cared much about priority in the naming\r\n     of species. I therefore paid for the skins which I\r\n     received, and have now published such as proved to be\r\n     new, according to my promise. But, let me assure you,\r\n     Reader, that seldom, if ever in my life, have I felt\r\n     more disgusted with the conduct of any opponents of\r\n     mine, than I was with the unfriendly boasters of their\r\n     zeal for the advancement of ornithological science, who\r\n     at that time existed in the fair city of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhile still in Philadelphia, on October 23, Audubon wrote to Thomas\r\nBrewer that Dr. Morton, the corresponding secretary of the Academy,\r\nhad not only permitted him to portray the new birds but had sold him\r\n\"ninety odd of the skins, forming a portion of the collection,\" and\r\nadded that with his other acquisitions they would swell his \"catalogue\r\nto the number of 475, all of which must be introduced in my fourth\r\nvolume.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years Audubon had expressed great contempt for all seekers\r\nafter priority in the naming of new species of animals, but now he\r\nbegan to find the pressure from without too strong to be resisted.\r\nRivalry in this field had become keen on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nand in the commendable desire to render his work as complete as\r\npossible, he was inevitably drawn into a struggle in which the higher\r\naspirations of scientific men are all too apt to be obscured by petty\r\nvanities, suspicions and disputes.\r\n\r\nWhile at Philadelphia Audubon paid this fine tribute to the\r\nornithologist whom he had met at Louisville twenty-six years before,\r\nand whose name had long been a cover for the jealousies and animosities\r\nof supposititious friends: \"Passed poor Alexander Wilson's schoolhouse,\r\nand heaved a sigh. Alas, poor Wilson! Would that I could once more\r\nspeak to thee, and listen to thy voice!\"\r\n\r\nAudubon was planning during the coming year to explore the west coast\r\nof Florida, in company with his son and Edward Harris, and to proceed\r\nas far as possible along the coast of Texas. From Philadelphia he\r\nwent to Baltimore, and on November 8 he arrived at Washington. His\r\nsteadfast friend and supporter, Colonel John James Abert, then at the\r\nhead of the Topographical Bureau, took him to the White House to call\r\non President Andrew Jackson and present his letters. The General,\r\nsaid Audubon, looked well and was smoking a pipe; after reading his\r\nletters attentively, he said at once: \"Mr. Audubon, I will do all in\r\nmy power to serve you, but the Seminole war, will, I fear, prevent you\r\nfrom having a cutter; however, as we shall have a committee at twelve\r\no'clock, we will consider this, and give you an answer tomorrow.\"\r\nLevi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury, was as friendly as ever, and\r\noffered the party passage to Charleston on the _Campbell_, a vessel of\r\nfifty-five tons carrying three guns and twenty-one men, but Audubon,\r\nwho was a poor sailor, preferred to travel by land and await the\r\ncoming of this boat at the Bachman home. Before leaving the capital\r\nthe naturalist and his son were invited to dine informally at the White\r\nHouse, and he had the opportunity of studying at close range \"a man who\r\nhad done much good and much evil to our country.\" Said Audubon of this\r\ndinner:\r\n\r\n     I sat close to him; we spoke of olden times, and\r\n     touched slightly on politics, and I found him very\r\n     averse to the cause of the Texans.... The dinner was\r\n     what might be called plain and substantial in England;\r\n     I dined from a fine young turkey, shot within twenty\r\n     miles of Washington. The general drank no wine, but\r\n     his health was drunk by us more than once; and he ate\r\n     very moderately, his last dish consisting of bread and\r\n     milk.[141]\r\n\r\nAudubon, with his son, John, left Washington on the 10th of November,\r\nand after traveling six days on one of \"the most extraordinary\r\nrailroads in the world,\" they reached the city of Charleston, where,\r\nunder the hospitable roof of John Bachman, the party eventually passed\r\nthe winter, though momentarily expecting their vessel, which did not\r\narrive. During this long interval of waiting, Audubon made drawings\r\nof all the new birds in the Nuttall-Townsend collection, representing\r\nupwards of seventy figures, and Miss Maria Martin, Bachman's\r\nsister-in-law, again assisted him in drawing plants and insects.\r\n\r\nAs spring approached and the long awaited _Campbell_ had not arrived,\r\nAudubon, with Harris and John, started overland for New Orleans. After\r\nseveral days of hard traveling by coaches they reached Montgomery, and\r\ndescended the Alabama River by steamboat to Mobile. When that district\r\nhad been ransacked for birds, they went on to Pensacola, where they\r\nlearned that the Government cutter would soon be at their service at\r\nNew Orleans; accordingly they retraced their steps to Mobile, passed\r\nthrough the lakes, and entered the southern capital, the city in which\r\nthe naturalist had nearly starved, a penniless stranger, sixteen years\r\nbefore, but which, less than three-quarters of a century later, was\r\nto raise a monument to his memory. He was still destined to a degree\r\nof disappointment, when it was learned that the _Campbell_ could not\r\nbe put in readiness before the last of March, but he was delighted to\r\nfind that the old pilot of the _Marion_, Napoleon Coste, was to command\r\nthis vessel. At New Orleans Audubon met for the last time \"good M. Le\r\nSueur,\" artist and naturalist, who had spent many years at New Harmony,\r\nIndiana, and whose acquaintance he had first made at Philadelphia in\r\n1824.\r\n\r\nAudubon and his party finally left New Orleans on the 1st of April and\r\nentered the Gulf by the Southwest Pass, where, on the 3rd of the month,\r\nthey were joined by the _Crusader_, a schooner of twelve tons which was\r\nattached to the Revenue Service; on this journey she carried a crew of\r\nfour, with as many guns, and acted as a tender to the larger vessel.\r\nThe expedition was provisioned for two months, and aimed to explore\r\nthe keys, bayous and shoreline from the Mississippi to the Bay of\r\nGalveston. Some of Audubon's experiences on this cruise were described\r\nin a letter to William MacGillivray,[142] dated \"Côte Blanche, 18\r\nApril, 1837,\" which we will now reproduce:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to William MacGillivray_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND,—\r\n\r\n     Being just now snugly anchored in a bay, the description\r\n     of which may prove agreeable to you, I sit down to give\r\n     you an account of what I have been doing since I last\r\n     wrote to you.\r\n\r\n     After visiting \"Rabbit Island,\" on which, as I have\r\n     already told you, not a single Rabbit or Hare is to\r\n     be seen, we made our way between it and Frisky Point,\r\n     by a narrow and somewhat difficult channel leading to\r\n     the bay in which I now write. The shores around us are\r\n     entirely formed of a bank, from twenty to thirty feet\r\n     high, and composed of concrete shells of various kinds,\r\n     among which the Common Oyster, however, predominates.\r\n     This bank, which at present looks as if bleached by the\r\n     sunshine and rain of centuries, is so white that it well\r\n     might form a guiding line to the vessels which navigate\r\n     this bay even in the darkest nights. The bay, however,\r\n     is so shallow, that it is rarely entered by vessels\r\n     larger than schooners of about seventy tons burthen,\r\n     which visit its shores to take in the sugars and cottons\r\n     grown in the neighbouring country.\r\n\r\n     The \"Crusader\" is a somewhat curious craft, small,\r\n     snug withal, and considerably roguish looking. She has\r\n     not fewer than four \"grunters\" on her fore deck, her\r\n     sails are of pure white cotton, and although she bears\r\n     the lively flag of our country at the peak, her being\r\n     painted purely black gives her the aspect, not merely\r\n     of a smuggler, but of a pirate. But here she is, at the\r\n     entrance of a canal of a sugar plantation, and close to\r\n     another craft, much the worse for wear, and, for aught\r\n     I know to the contrary, belonging to the captain alone,\r\n     who, I would almost venture to assert, belongs to no\r\n     country at all.\r\n\r\n     It is now four weeks since a razor came in contact with\r\n     my chin. All my companions are equally hircine; or, if\r\n     you please, hirsute. As to our clothing, were you to\r\n     see us at this moment, you would be ready to exclaim,\r\n     \"What vagabonds these fellows are!\" Coats and trousers\r\n     plastered with mire, shirts no longer white, guns\r\n     exhibiting the appearance of being in constant use, and\r\n     all sorts of accoutrements that pertain to determined\r\n     hunters, complete our _tout ensemble_. But, as I have\r\n     said, here we are, and on shore must go. \"Man the gig,\"\r\n     quoth our captain. In a trice the gig is manned. One\r\n     after another, for there are five or six of us, we swing\r\n     ourselves into the after-sheets. The word is given, the\r\n     oars are plied, and now we are once more on terra firma.\r\n\r\n     The crossing of large bays, cumbered with shallow bars\r\n     and banks of oyster-shells, is always to me extremely\r\n     disagreeable, and more especially when all these bars\r\n     and banks do not contain a single living specimen of\r\n     that most delectable shell-fish. Nay, I am assured\r\n     by our pilot, who is no youngster, that ever since he\r\n     first visited this extensive waste, not an oyster has\r\n     been procured in these parts. But now, in single file,\r\n     like culprits or hungry travellers, we proceed along\r\n     the margin of the canal. Ah, my dear friend, would that\r\n     you were here just now to see the Snipes innumerable,\r\n     the Blackbirds, the Gallinules, and the Curlews that\r\n     surround us;—that you could listen as I now do, to the\r\n     delightful notes of the Mocking-bird, pouring forth\r\n     his soul in melody as the glorious orb of day is fast\r\n     descending towards the western horizon;—that you could\r\n     watch the light gambols of the Night Hawk, or gaze on\r\n     the Great Herons which, after spreading their broad\r\n     wings, croak aloud as if doubtful regarding the purpose\r\n     of our visit to these shores! Ah! how well do I know you\r\n     would enjoy all this; but, alas! we are more than four\r\n     thousand miles apart.\r\n\r\n     Hark! what's that? Nothing but a parcel of men coming\r\n     to greet us. Here they are, seven or eight Negroes. Who\r\n     lives here my good fellows? Major Gordy, massa. Well,\r\n     now show us the way to the house. Yes, gentlemen, come\r\n     along. So we follow our swarthy guides.\r\n\r\n     The plantations here are of great value, both on\r\n     account of their proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, and\r\n     the excellence of the soil, which, as in other parts\r\n     of Louisiana, is composed of a fat, black mould. The\r\n     Indian corn was at least six feet high, and looked\r\n     most beautiful. As we approached the mansion of Major\r\n     Gordy, I observed that it has a pleasant aspect, and was\r\n     furnished with a fine garden, and a yard well stocked\r\n     with cattle, together with a good number of horses and\r\n     mules, just let loose from labour. A mill for grinding\r\n     corn and making sugar particularly drew our notice to\r\n     it, as the Crusader happened just then to be destitute\r\n     of both articles; and as I saw some women milking the\r\n     cows, my heart fairly leaped with joy, and the hope\r\n     that ere long we might procure a full bowl of the\r\n     delightful and salubrious beverage. The short twilight\r\n     of our southern latitudes had now almost involved every\r\n     object in that dim obscurity so congenial to most living\r\n     creatures after the toils of the day, as allowing them\r\n     to enjoy that placid quiet which is required to restore\r\n     their faded energies.\r\n\r\n     Near the entrance of the mansion stood an elderly man,\r\n     of tall stature and firm aspect, leaning on what I\r\n     would call a desperate long gun. As I approached this\r\n     Côte Blanche planter, I thought that something not so\r\n     very friendly as I could have wished was expressed in\r\n     his countenance. As he rested his heavy frame on his\r\n     monstrous rifle, he neither moved his head, nor held\r\n     out his hand to me, until I presented mine to him,\r\n     saying, \"My good sir, how do you do?\" His answer was\r\n     a rather suspicious look at me and my companions; but\r\n     notwithstanding, and probably because he was on his own\r\n     ground, he asked us what was our wish, and then desired\r\n     us to walk in.\r\n\r\n     Côte Blanche Bay, you must be informed, has for a number\r\n     of years been infested by a set of rascally piratical\r\n     vagabonds, who have committed extensive depredations, in\r\n     consequence of which, a few years ago, a United States'\r\n     revenue cutter was sent to protect the coast. I have no\r\n     doubt that the major took us, to a man, for members of\r\n     the gang who had more than once visited, not his house,\r\n     but his plantation, on which they had played many wanton\r\n     and atrocious freaks.\r\n\r\n     We now, however, had entered the house. Candles were\r\n     lighted, and we at once came face to face, as it were.\r\n     It curiously happened that our captain was without his\r\n     uniform, and fully as rough looking otherwise as any\r\n     of us. I was, however, much pleased to see that the\r\n     major himself was not much superior to us in respect\r\n     of apparel; nor had his razor been employed for many\r\n     days. I happened to have about me some unequivocal\r\n     credentials, from the head departments of the United\r\n     States, which, on my observing that some degree of\r\n     suspicion still remained, I placed in his hands. He\r\n     read them, spoke kindly to us, promised to forward our\r\n     letters to the nearest post-town, and invited us to\r\n     consider his dwelling as our own. From that moment until\r\n     we returned to our vessel, we were all as comfortable\r\n     and merry as men can be when distant from their own dear\r\n     homes.\r\n\r\n     Next morning we received from Major Gordy a barrel of\r\n     sugar, another of corn meal, some pails of milk, and a\r\n     quantity of newly made butter, together with potatoes\r\n     and other needful articles—and all this without being\r\n     allowed so much as to offer him the least recompense.\r\n     The day after, we returned to breakfast by invitation,\r\n     and found in the house several strangers armed with\r\n     rifles and double-barrelled guns. After we had been\r\n     introduced to all around, we seated ourselves, and\r\n     made a vigorous attack upon our host's eggs and bacon,\r\n     coffee, tea, and milk. As this important business\r\n     was proceeding, I was delighted to hear the following\r\n     anecdotes, which I hope you, my dear friend, will relish\r\n     as much as I did.\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen,\" said our host, straightening himself up\r\n     in his chair, \"I am considerably suspicious as regards\r\n     the strangers who happen to anchor within the range of\r\n     my dominions. Indeed, gentlemen, I must acknowledge\r\n     that even after you returned on board last night, I\r\n     sent off some of my men in various directions, to let\r\n     my neighbours know that a strange craft had anchored\r\n     near the landing-place; and here, gentlemen, are those\r\n     neighbours of mine; but as it happens that the name of\r\n     the gentleman who calls himself a 'Naturalist' is well\r\n     known to some of them, I now feel quite satisfied as\r\n     respects the purposes you have in view. But let me tell\r\n     you what happened to me some years ago.\r\n\r\n     \"Such a shark-looking craft as the one you call the\r\n     Crusader happened to drop its anchor abreast of my\r\n     landing-place, about dusk one evening, and as I guessed\r\n     that the fellows on board were not better than they\r\n     should be, I watched their motions for a while from\r\n     my back piazza. But nothing happened that night. Next\r\n     morning, however, I heard the firing of guns down the\r\n     meadows where my cattle and hogs were in the habit of\r\n     feeding. So I took my rifle, walked towards the spot,\r\n     and soon found, sure enough, that the rascals had killed\r\n     a fine ox and several hogs, which they were dragging\r\n     to the shore. Indeed, gentlemen, I saw the yawl crammed\r\n     with the spoils of my plantation. Well, I took as good\r\n     an aim as I could at the nearest man, and cracked away,\r\n     but without hitting. At the report of my gun the fellows\r\n     all took to their heels, and getting on board hoisted\r\n     sail and went off. I have never heard of them since.\r\n     Well, gentlemen, about the same hour next morning, a\r\n     black-looking barge, hardly as large as your Crusader,\r\n     came to, off the very same spot, and although I watched\r\n     it and every one on board nearly the whole night, and\r\n     it was a beautiful moon-shining one, not a soul of them\r\n     came on shore until morning. Then, however, I saw some\r\n     bustle on board. Several men got off in a very small\r\n     affair, which was fastened astern of the large boat.\r\n     I saw them land, and deliberately walk towards the\r\n     meadows. No sooner had they reached the wettest part,\r\n     and that is where my hogs generally root for food,\r\n     than crack, crack, crack, went off their guns in all\r\n     directions. You may well suppose how vexed I was at\r\n     all this, and conceive how soon I mustered my men with\r\n     clubs, and armed myself with my rifle. On reaching the\r\n     ground, think, gentlemen, what were my thoughts, when I\r\n     saw the fellows all advancing towards me and my people,\r\n     as if they were the honestest men in the world. I was\r\n     so mad when they came close up, that I had a mind to\r\n     shoot the one in front, for he looked for all the world\r\n     as if he cared not a pin for any one. However, I did not\r\n     shoot, but asked him why he was shooting my hogs? 'Hogs!\r\n     good man, you are quite mistaken; we are shooting snipes\r\n     until we come in contact with the rascally pirates who\r\n     infest the coast, and lay waste your plantations. My\r\n     name, my good sir, is Captain ——, of the United States\r\n     Navy; and these are some of my men. Will you come on\r\n     board, and breakfast with us on your own snipes?'\" No\r\n     wonder that the major, having been subject to the visits\r\n     of these marauders, should have taken us in the dusk,\r\n     armed as we were, and withal not having precisely the\r\n     aspect of sober citizens, for persons not quite as good\r\n     as we should be. But I must now conclude, and in my next\r\n     you shall hear something of the result of my expedition\r\n     into the marshes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BUST OF AUDUBON BY WILLIAM COUPER IN THE\r\n    AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n    Published by courtesy of the American Museum of Natural\r\n    History.]\r\n\r\nAfter wading through mud for whole days, exposed to scorching heat,\r\nand constantly annoyed by myriads of insects in the course of their\r\nnumerous excursions on shore, they reached Galveston Bay on the 24th\r\nof April. The fort of Galveston returned their salute of \"26 fires,\"\r\ngiven by the big gun on the _Campbell_, and shortly after they received\r\na visit from the Secretary of the Navy of the Republic of Texas, which\r\nunder Sam Houston had declared its independence but a few weeks before\r\ntheir arrival, and were invited to proceed to the seat of government,\r\nat Houston, eighty miles distant, in the interior. They landed on\r\nthe 26th of April, and after three weeks had been spent in exploring\r\nGalveston Island and its adjacent shores for birds and animals of all\r\nsorts, they started for Houston on the 8th of May. After making about\r\ntwelve miles, their vessel grounded on Red Fish Bar, and the party then\r\ntook to tender and gig, reaching their destination on the 15th; wild\r\nturkeys, ibises, and ducks of many kinds were seen in great numbers\r\nalong their course.\r\n\r\nAudubon has left a graphic account[143] of what he then saw at the\r\ncapital of this short-lived infant Republic, including its picturesque\r\nPresident, the _mêlée_ of dejected Mexican prisoners then gathered\r\nthere, and its drunken Indians, \"halooing and stumbling about in\r\nthe mud in every direction.\" Houston's abode was a small log house,\r\n\"consisting of two rooms, with a passage through, after the Southern\r\nfashion.\"\r\n\r\n     The moment we stepped over the threshold, on the\r\n     right hand of the passage, we found ourselves ushered\r\n     into what in other countries would be called the\r\n     ante-chamber; the ground floor, however, was muddy and\r\n     filthy; a large fire was burning; a small table, covered\r\n     with paper and writing materials, was in the centre;\r\n     camp-beds, trunks, and different materials were strewn\r\n     around the room. We were at once presented to several\r\n     members of the cabinet, some of whom bore the stamp\r\n     of intellectual ability, simple though bold, in their\r\n     general appearance....\r\n\r\n     The President was engaged in the opposite room on\r\n     national business, and we could not see him for some\r\n     time. Meanwhile we amused ourselves by walking to the\r\n     capitol, which was yet without a roof, and the floors,\r\n     benches and tables of both houses of Congress were as\r\n     well saturated with water as our clothes had been in the\r\n     morning. Being invited by one of the great men of the\r\n     place to enter a booth to take a drink of grog with him,\r\n     we did so; but I was rather surprised that he offered\r\n     his name, instead of the cash, to the bar-keeper.\r\n\r\n     We first caught sight of President Houston as he walked\r\n     from one of the grog-shops, where he had been to prevent\r\n     the sale of ardent spirits. He was on his way to his\r\n     house, and wore a large gray coarse hat, and the bulk\r\n     of his figure reminded me of the appearance of General\r\n     Hopkins of Virginia, for like him he is upwards of six\r\n     feet high, and strong in proportion. But I observed a\r\n     scowl in the expression of his eyes, that was forbidding\r\n     and disagreeable. We reached his abode before him, but\r\n     he soon came, and we were presented to his excellency.\r\n     He was dressed in a fancy velvet coat, and trowsers\r\n     trimmed with broad gold-lace; around his neck was tied a\r\n     cravat somewhat in the style of seventy-six. He received\r\n     us kindly, was desirous of retaining us for awhile, and\r\n     offered us every facility within his power. He at once\r\n     removed us from the anteroom to his private chamber,\r\n     which by the way was not much cleaner than the former.\r\n     We were severally introduced by him to the different\r\n     members of his cabinet and staff, and at once asked to\r\n     drink grog with him, which we did, wishing success to\r\n     his new republic. Our talk was short; but the impression\r\n     which was made on my mind at the time by himself,\r\n     his officers, and his place of abode, can never be\r\n     forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe party left Texas on the 18th of May, and on the 27th reached New\r\nOrleans, which was then oppressively hot and nearly deserted. Here\r\nAudubon's collections and equipment were packed to be sent north;\r\nhis dog was given to his brother-in-law, William Bakewell, and on the\r\nlast day of the month the party began to retrace their steps of the\r\nprevious March. After more hard traveling by car, coach and railroad,\r\nCharleston was reached in eight and a half days, on June 10, 1837.\r\nEdward Harris, who ascended the Mississippi from New Orleans for the\r\npurpose of making further collections, later rejoined the party at\r\nBachman's home in Charleston. Audubon said that he lost twelve pounds\r\nin weight during this journey, which proved exceedingly trying, and\r\nthe hardships encountered were hardly commensurate with the returns in\r\nbird and animal lore; yet Audubon was by no means dissatisfied at the\r\nresults, as shown by the following account which he gave Thomas Brewer\r\ntwo days after his return:[144]\r\n\r\n     The weather during the principal portion of our absence\r\n     was unusually cold, even for the season, and this gave\r\n     us, perhaps, the very best opportunities ever afforded\r\n     to any student of nature to observe the _inward_\r\n     migrations of myriads of the birds that visit us from\r\n     the south and west when the imperative laws of nature\r\n     force them from their winter retreats towards other\r\n     countries to multiply. To tell you all regarding this\r\n     would be more by a thousand times than can be given\r\n     in a letter written in haste, and I will therefore at\r\n     once touch the spring with whose sound you are most\r\n     in harmony. We procured many eggs for you—ay, a great\r\n     number—and as soon as we reach New York I will make up\r\n     a large box, and take it to you myself.... One thing\r\n     that will interest you most, as it did me, is that we\r\n     found west of the Mississippi many species of ducks\r\n     breeding as contented as if in latitude 68° north. There\r\n     is, after all, nothing like seeing things or countries\r\n     to enable one to judge of their peculiarities, and I\r\n     now feel satisfied that through the want of these means\r\n     many erroneous notions remain in scientific works that\r\n     can not otherwise be eradicated. We found not one new\r\n     species, but the mass of observations that we have\r\n     gathered connected with the ornithology of our country,\r\n     has, I think, never been surpassed. I feel myself now\r\n     tolerably competent to give an essay on the geographical\r\n     distribution of the feathered tribes of our dear\r\n     country, and I promise that I will do so, with naught\r\n     but facts and notes made on the very spot, and at the\r\n     fitting time.\r\n\r\nMaria Rebecca Bachman, eldest of the nine Bachman children, was married\r\nat this time to John Woodhouse Audubon, and the entire party started\r\nnorth before the end of June. They went by steamer to Norfolk, and\r\nthence to Washington, where Audubon presented his letters to President\r\nVan Buren and tendered his thanks in person to the various officers of\r\nthe Government and friends who had aided his expedition; they passed\r\nrapidly through Baltimore and Philadelphia, to New York, where Audubon\r\nremained a fortnight, while his son and daughter-in-law were enjoying\r\na honeymoon at Niagara Falls. All sailed from New York on the packet\r\n_England_, and landed at Liverpool on the 2d of August. Five days later\r\nthe family was united in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nAUDUBON'S GREATEST TRIUMPH\r\n\r\n     Extension of his work—Financial panic and revolt of\r\n     patrons—New western collections—His \"Book of Nature\"\r\n     completed—Work on the letterpress in Edinburgh—Vacation\r\n     in the Highlands—Commissions to Harris—Parting\r\n     address to the reader—Dissolution of the Havell\r\n     engraving establishment—The residuum of _The Birds of\r\n     America_—Robert Havell, engraver, and his family—Lizars'\r\n     first edition and the Havell reissues of plates—Brief\r\n     manual for collectors—Appreciations—Total edition of\r\n     _The Birds of America_—Past and present prices—The\r\n     Rothschild incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Audubon's return to England in the summer of 1837, the completion\r\nof his _magnum opus_ occupied but two years. Certain now of the\r\nultimate success which would crown his efforts, he worked with a\r\nfurious ardor, determined not only to execute his original plans, but\r\nto extend them, if necessary, to include every bird which had been\r\ndiscovered in America, or, at least, in the United States.\r\n\r\nAudubon wrote Thomas Brewer in September that, for some unexplained\r\ncause, a large part of his collections made in Texas had probably\r\nbeen lost; when writing on October 29, the box containing all\r\nthe eggs collected on the Gulf of Mexico had not come to hand. He\r\ncontinued:[145]\r\n\r\n     I authorize you to offer and to pay as much as _five\r\n     dollars_ for an old _raven_, in the flesh, and perfect\r\n     as far as _internals_ are concerned. European writers\r\n     who a few years since were all agog to prove that our\r\n     apparently analogous species were identical with those\r\n     of Europe have suddenly \"faced about,\" and pronounce our\r\n     birds to be quite distinct species, and of course now\r\n     say that our raven is indeed our raven! and all this\r\n     because I proved that the _Corvus corone_ of Europe\r\n     existed not in America. All this induces the present\r\n     _natural_ student of nature to have his eyes and all his\r\n     senses fully open, and to see into things further than\r\n     we can into grindstones....\r\n\r\n     Charles Bonaparte, who has just this moment left me,\r\n     has kindly proffered me his new North American species,\r\n     and I hope to figure them all, thereby rendering my\r\n     work the more complete, if not quite perfect, as far as\r\n     truly well-known species are now thought to exist in the\r\n     limits of our country, or indeed those of North America.\r\n\r\nWhen writing his young friend again, on November 18, he implored him to\r\nproceed\r\n\r\n     with all possible industry, in procuring the birds of my\r\n     list, in rum. I hope you will have a pair of pied ducks\r\n     (_Fuligula labradora_) for me. Send me all the drawings\r\n     of eggs you can so that they reach me here by the 1st to\r\n     10th of March next. If the birds arrive in London by the\r\n     middle of April, it will do.... I send you inclosed the\r\n     copy of an advertisement of my work, which I wish you to\r\n     hand over to our most generous friend George Parkman,\r\n     Esq., M.D., and ask him to have it inserted in one or\r\n     more of the Boston newspapers as soon as convenient.\r\n\r\nAgain, on the 22nd, he admonished his friend not to send his \"drawings\r\nof eggs by _letter_,\" but to forward all such to N. Berthoud, \"and ask\r\nhim to send them by captains of London packets. The postages are very\r\nheavy these hard times, and I am not a _prince_.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Audubon's \"Prospectus\" called for only eighty parts of 400\r\nplates, by 1837 the number of new discoveries had multiplied to such\r\nan extent that he faced the dilemma of either enlarging his work or\r\nissuing it in an incomplete state. In the summer of that year large\r\nnumbers of his British patrons discontinued their subscriptions, a\r\nresult, no doubt, of the disastrous panic which had driven many into\r\nbankruptcy, and still more refused to take any plates in excess of\r\nthe stipulated number. To alleviate this anticipated difficulty, he\r\nhad already begun to admit composite plates, on which from two to six\r\ndifferent kinds of birds were grouped together, much in the older style\r\nwhich he abhorred; but, in spite of this concession and omission of the\r\neggs, colored figures of which he had hoped to give at the end, he was\r\nobliged to add seven parts, thus swelling the total number of large\r\nplates to 435, which represented 489 supposedly distinct species of\r\nAmerican birds.\r\n\r\nWhen Audubon was facing such protests in England, Dr. J. K.\r\nTownsend[146] returned to Philadelphia with a second great collection\r\nfrom the Far West. How eager he was, at this psychological moment, to\r\ngain access to these ornithological treasures is clearly shown in the\r\nfollowing letter[147] to Edward Harris:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Edward Harris_\r\n\r\n          [Outside address] TO EDD HARRIS Esqr.\r\n          Moorestown New Jersey\r\n          9 miles from Philadelphia Pennsylvania\r\n          U. S. A.\r\n\r\n          Duplicate\r\n\r\n          LONDON, _Oct. 26th., 1837_.\r\n\r\n     I have this moment received your dear letter of the 4.\r\n     instant, for the contents of which, I do indeed most\r\n     truly thank you, but the most important point contained\r\n     in it, Dr. Spencer is now at Paris quite well and happy.\r\n     I have not heard of his supposed intentions to visit\r\n     Russia, at least not until you have shown yourself\r\n     in Europe for awhile. When will you come? I have not\r\n     received one single letter from Dr. Morton since my\r\n     return to England, and have been the more surprised at\r\n     this, because I look upon _him_ as a worthy good man and\r\n     as one whom, since my last visit to him, I cannot but\r\n     consider as my friend.\r\n\r\n     The return of Dr. Townsend to our happy land has filled\r\n     me with joy, and trebly so when you tell me that he is\r\n     as friendly disposed to me as I ever have been towards\r\n     him. I congratulate you my dear friend, in the step\r\n     which you have so kindly taken in my favour, by first\r\n     selecting all such Bird-skins as you or Townsend have\r\n     considered as new, and also in having given freedom\r\n     to Dr. Morton to pay Dr. Townsend Fifty Dollars\r\n     for the skins selected by you, under the _prudent_\r\n     considerations or restrictions talked of in your letter.\r\n     May I receive all the Bird skins very soon, for depend\r\n     upon it, now or never is for me the period to push on\r\n     my publication. If I have any regret to express it is,\r\n     that Townsend or Dr. Morton or yourself did not at once\r\n     forward to me the _whole_ of the Bird skins brought\r\n     latterly by Townsend, for I can assure you that it has\r\n     become a matter of the _greatest niceity_ to distinguish\r\n     the slight though _positive_ species lines of\r\n     demarkation between our species of Birds—and if on this\r\n     reaching you, the least doubt exists amongst yourselves\r\n     respecting any one, why send it to me at once by the\r\n     very earliest conveyance. If by New York, with letter to\r\n     N. Berthoud to lose not a day, provided a packet, either\r\n     to _Liverpool_ or London, is ready to sail! Had Townsend\r\n     sent me the _whole_ of his disposible birds, I might now\r\n     have perhaps been able to have mad[e] him a remittance\r\n     in cash, which the single arrival of the German\r\n     Naturalists, who are now in California may hereafter\r\n     put an end to. Mention this to him, nay, shew him this\r\n     letter if you please and assure him that I am willing to\r\n     exert myself in his behalf. Indeed, I wish you to urge\r\n     him in forwarding me either his own manuscripts or a\r\n     copy of all such parts as appertain to Birds, as soon as\r\n     possible, knowing (I think) that he will not undertake\r\n     to publish them himself under his present (I am sorry\r\n     to say) embarrassed pecuniary circumstances. Tell him\r\n     that I want all about the habits of _any_ Birds which\r\n     he has written upon, especially, however, those found\r\n     from the beginning of his journeys until his return,\r\n     and appertaining to species belonging to our fauna or\r\n     otherwise. Their exact measurements, dates, localities,\r\n     migratories or vice versa inclinations, descriptions\r\n     of nests, eggs &c. periods of breeding; in a word all\r\n     that he can, or will be pleased to send me—and you may\r\n     assure Townsend, that all he will confide to me will be\r\n     published as coming from _him_, although I may think\r\n     fit to alter the phraseology in some instances. Tell\r\n     him to be extremely careful in naming his new species,\r\n     and that [if] he thinks of difficulties in this matter,\r\n     to leave it to me, as _here_ I am able to see all the\r\n     late published works (and they are not a few) and work\r\n     out the species with more advantage than any one can\r\n     at present in Philadelphia. Do not take this as egotism\r\n     far from it, it is in friendship and for his sake that\r\n     I venture on undertaking such an arduous task. I am\r\n     _exceedingly_ [anxious] to receive a letter from him\r\n     (for Nuttall, though an excellent friend of mine and\r\n     a most worthy man, will not answer me in time on this\r\n     subject) of _all_ the birds contained in the _plates_\r\n     now at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philada.,\r\n     _which he saw on the Rocky Mountains_, over those\r\n     mountains, _on the Columbia River_ and off _the coast_\r\n     of our _Western boundaries_. This I want much, and\r\n     if he would simply dictate to you plate 1, not there,\r\n     plate 2, there, plate 3 there &c. &c. this would amply\r\n     answer my purpose, and this I wish you not to neglect\r\n     to forward me _as soon as possible by duplicate_! Of\r\n     course I cannot speak upon any one of the new species of\r\n     which you speak until I have examined them all. To talk\r\n     of new species in London is a matter not now understood\r\n     in any part of America, and sorry will you be as well\r\n     as himself, when I assure you that out of the _twelve_\r\n     supposed to be, and published by Dr. Morton, from\r\n     Townsend's first cargo, not more than six are actually\r\n     undescribed, although I have taken upon myself the risk\r\n     of publishing _his_ names to the Birds on my plate, but\r\n     which of course I am obliged to correct in my letter\r\n     press. _The little beautiful owl_, I would venture to\r\n     say has been described by Vigors at least ten years ago,\r\n     &c. &c. Swainson never goes to bed without describing\r\n     some new species, and Charles Bonaparte, during his late\r\n     visit to London, has published as many as 20 of a night\r\n     at the Museum of the Zoological Society Insects &c. &c.\r\n     Stir, work hard, [be] _prompt_ in every thing. My work\r\n     _must_ soon be finished, and unless _all is received\r\n     here_ by the month of May next, why I shall have to\r\n     abandon to others what I might myself have accomplished.\r\n     God bless you, many happy years. We are all well, thank\r\n     God, just now. Remember me and us kindly to all around\r\n     and every friend and believe me ever your most truly and\r\n     sincerely attached friend,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n          TO EDWARD HARRIS, Esqre.\r\n\r\n          Addressed, care \"Messrs. Rathbone, Brothers & Co.\r\n          Liverpool.\"\r\n\r\n     When you send to Liverpool.\r\n\r\n     If Townsend has brought Birds Eggs, ask him to send them\r\n     me. I will return all to him that he may want. I greatly\r\n     regret that you did not find me the _water_ Birds\r\n     of which you speak, as I might have perchance found\r\n     something new or curious among them. The Golden Eye Duck\r\n     especially, if any be had?\r\n\r\nIn reference to the new species of birds which had come into his hands,\r\nAudubon said:\r\n\r\n     What was I to do? Why, to publish them, to be sure;\r\n     for this I should have done, to the best of my power,\r\n     even if every subscriber in Europe had refused to take\r\n     them. What! said I, shall the last volume of the \"Birds\r\n     of America\" be now closed, at a time when new species\r\n     are in my hands? No! And in spite of threats from this\r\n     quarter and that, that such and such persons would\r\n     discontinue their subscriptions (which indeed they have\r\n     done), and refuse to take the few numbers that would\r\n     have rendered their copies complete, my wish to do all\r\n     that was in my power has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nDoubtless we should hesitate to blame many of Audubon's subscribers\r\nfor wishing to be relieved from an obligation which for a period of\r\nten years had cost them from $50 to $100 per annum, not to speak of\r\nany who had met financial disaster in the panic of that day, but at\r\nthis juncture he really had no choice. When his eightieth Number,\r\noriginally intended to be the last, appeared in 1837, many important\r\nkinds of birds, including ducks, swan, tern, and the Flamingo, as\r\nwell as grouse, warblers and woodpeckers, were still calling loud for\r\nrecognition. So generous of space had he been in the earlier phase of\r\nhis undertaking that twenty species were each shown on two distinct\r\nplates, while in the end the need of compression compelled him to\r\nintroduce thirty-five composite plates.\r\n\r\nSubscribers to _The Birds of America_ at the beginning had been\r\npermitted to take a part or the whole, and many incomplete sets were\r\ncirculated, upwards of 120, as Audubon declared in 1839, having then\r\ndiscontinued their subscriptions. Towards the end of his undertaking,\r\nowing to the great expense and uncertainty involved, he was disinclined\r\nto supply any but regular subscribers, as shown by the following\r\nletter written from London, May 25, 1838, to William A. Colman of New\r\nYork:[148]\r\n\r\n     ... We find that six of the plates you want are not\r\n     only largest figs, but some of them extremely full and\r\n     difficult to colour, and he [Mr. Havell] says that\r\n     our Printers and our Colourers would not undertake\r\n     to go throu them without charging a most extravagant\r\n     price. I have no extra plates whatever on hand, and\r\n     in consequence of this must be obliged to decline\r\n     furnishing you with them.\r\n\r\n     If at the conclusion of my publication I find any of\r\n     the plates you want they will be sent to you forthwith,\r\n     but I wish you not to calculate upon this until you hear\r\n     again from me, or from my sons on this subject.\r\n\r\n     My work will [be] entirely finished by the end of next\r\n     month, when our engraving and Printing establishment\r\n     will be broken up, and few will indeed there be copies\r\n     to be had by any one, who has not subscribed to the\r\n     \"Birds of America.\"\r\n\r\n     Should you see any of my American subscribers who have\r\n     not as yet seen any portion of the work, please to\r\n     assure them that as soon as the fourth volume is quite\r\n     finished, and _bound_ according to their desires, their\r\n     copies will be forwarded at once to their respective\r\n     homes, or to whomsoever they have directed me to send\r\n     their copies.\r\n\r\nOn May 26 Audubon wrote Thomas M. Brewer that \"Edward Harris, one\r\nof the best men of this world,\" had reached his house \"yesterday at\r\nnoon, after a pleasant passage of fourteen days and a few hours.\" \"My\r\nillustrations,\" he said, \"will be finished on the 20th of next month,\r\nand the fourth volume of text shortly afterward\"; at the end he added:\r\n\"When I return to our beloved land, I intend to spend a full season\r\nabout the lakes in Northern Vermont, for, from what I hear, much\r\nknowledge is to be acquired there and thereabouts.\" After returning to\r\nNew York in September of the following year, he again alluded to the\r\nramble he would like to take \"along the borders of the famous lakes of\r\nNew Hampshire and Vermont,\" but was unable to bring it to pass at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTo depart but slightly from the chronological sequence, the last to be\r\npreserved of Audubon's letters to William Swainson,[149] written at a\r\ntime when his great work was drawing to a close, will be given at this\r\npoint:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to William Swainson_\r\n\r\n          LONDON _11th Jan 1838_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR SWAINSON,\r\n\r\n     The severe indisposition of my good wife which has\r\n     continued almost unabated now since I had the pleasure\r\n     of seeing you, is my excuse for not having ere this\r\n     answered your two notes, especially the last of the 8th\r\n     instant.—\r\n\r\n     Your box & contents came perfectly safe to hand, and\r\n     I think will soon again be in your possession in like\r\n     good order. I certainly should like to see the Buteo [?]\r\n     vulgaris to compare it with mine (that at the mouth of\r\n     the Columbia) and the one described by Nuttall before\r\n     the return from America of D. [Dr. John] Richardson\r\n     & of which it seems you were not aware.—I am glad\r\n     nevertheless that if differing from the European bird\r\n     of that name the Transatlantic bird will be honoured by\r\n     your own name.\r\n\r\n     Charles Bonaparte is at Paris & is to remain there.

And again I should like you to tell\r\n     me whether you have seen the Clangula vulgaris of Linn.\r\n     that in the months of April & May?\r\n\r\n     Many thanks for all your kind wishes & may you and\r\n     yours enjoy the like return of many many new & happy\r\n     years.—Call upon us when you come to Town and believe me\r\n     my dear Mr Swainson ever sincerily\r\n\r\n          yours attached friend\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON\r\n\r\n     I have had the jawache for nearly one week & have not\r\n     been out of the house\r\n\r\n     4 WIMPOLE STREET\r\n\r\nAudubon's day of greatest triumph came on June 20, 1838, when he\r\nhad the supreme satisfaction of seeing the last plate of his \"Book\r\nof Nature,\" _The Birds of America_, completed. Having been begun\r\nvirtually in the autumn of 1826, it was in press nearly twelve years.\r\nThe sumptuous character of this work, its commanding beauty, as well\r\nas its surprising accuracy, considering all the obstacles of time and\r\ncircumstance, mark it, when combined with its letterpress, as one of\r\nthe most remarkable and interesting undertakings in the history of\r\nliterature and science in the nineteenth century. Unique as it was in\r\nevery detail of its workmanship, it will remain for centuries a shining\r\nexample of the triumph of human endeavor and of the spirit and will of\r\nman. This is true in spite of any errors it may disclose, and even if\r\nit be conceded that bare bones and plain photographs are more valuable\r\nfor elucidating the technicalities of science than the most artistic\r\nproductions of the pen, pencil or brush.\r\n\r\nAudubon's labors in England, however, did not end with the completion\r\nof his plates, for two volumes of his \"Biographies\" still remained to\r\nbe published. He was in London during the early summer of 1838, when\r\nhe recorded a visit from John Bachman, who had come to Europe for the\r\nrecuperation of his health. He was then obliged to hasten to Edinburgh,\r\nwhere he was soon joined by both Bachman and Victor Audubon and later\r\nby other members of his family. For the convenience of work he took\r\nrooms near the museums, on the south side of the city, not far from\r\nLauriston Place and within easy reach of \"The Meadows,\" a well known\r\nrecreation ground.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LIFE MASK OF AUDUBON MADE BY ROBERT HAVELL IN LONDON\r\n    BEFORE 1839, NOW IN POSSESSION OF THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOÖLOGY\r\n    OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n    Published by courtesy of Dr. Samuel Henshaw, Director of the Museum\r\n    of Comparative Zoölogy.]\r\n\r\nThe following letter,[150] sent to his son John soon after his arrival\r\nat the Scottish capital, and addressed \"No. 4 Wimpole Street, London,\"\r\nabounds in interesting personal details, but the student of birds\r\nwould find more significant its clear statement of his relations\r\nwith MacGillivray; it shows us the anatomist at work, and Audubon as\r\nhis student and \"secretary.\" \"Under his kind tuition,\" he said, when\r\nwriting at a little later time, \"I think I have learned something\r\nof anatomy, which may enable me, at some future period, to produce\r\nobservations that may prove interesting....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to his Son, John_\r\n\r\n          EDINBURGH, _July 1st, 1838, Sunday_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAREST FRIENDS\r\n\r\n     Your joint letter of the 27th Wednesday, did not\r\n     reach me until yesterday afternoon, probably because\r\n     the steamer which brought it did not leave London on\r\n     that evening on a/c of the coronation etc., Here the\r\n     festivals were poor beyond description, and although\r\n     scarcely anything was to be seen, the whole population\r\n     was on foot the entire day, and nearly the whole night,\r\n     gazing at each other like lost sheep.—No illuminations\r\n     except at two shops, Mr. Henderson's and another close\r\n     by him.—The fireworks at the castle consisted merely\r\n     of about one hundred rockets, not a gun was fired\r\n     from the batteries. MacGillivray & I went to see the\r\n     fireworks at 10 p.m., and soon returned disgusted.—His\r\n     museum (College of Surgeons) and the Edinburgh Museum\r\n     were thrown open _gratis_, and were thronged to excess\r\n     Upwards of 20000 in the first, and about 25000 in\r\n     the other; all was however quite orderly. The day was\r\n     showery; cloudy and dismal at times, but the evening was\r\n     clear and fine.—Mr. Hill's father died on the morning of\r\n     the 27th and I have not seen Alexander H., since. Many\r\n     thanks to Maria for her bunch of letters, and the few\r\n     lines of her own to me, I hope that everything will go\r\n     on well with you all.\r\n\r\n     We begin printing _tomorrow 2d of July, 1838!!_ remember\r\n     that Mesdames et Messieurs! and I intend to proceed\r\n     with all possible despatch and care. _All_ the birds in\r\n     rum will be inspected as far as internal or digestive\r\n     organs, trachea &c are concerned, and as I am constantly\r\n     present in the dissecting room, I think I shall know\r\n     something about the matter anon.—I am almost in hopes\r\n     to see Victor tomorrow night but cannot be sure. There\r\n     are somewhere at home the nests of the birds found on\r\n     the Columbia by Nuttall and Townsend, I believe that\r\n     of Bewick's Wren is among them; send them _all_, very\r\n     carefully packed. I want the journal of my first trip\r\n     to the Floridas, which was cut out of my large leather\r\n     journal, previous to going to Labrador, also a letter on\r\n     the habits of the Yellow-bellied Cuckoo, by a gentleman\r\n     at Charleston. If it cannot be found perhaps Maria will\r\n     recollect his name, being a friend of John Bachman,\r\n     if so send me that, _in full_ if possible. It is the\r\n     gentleman in whose garden I procured the small and large\r\n     cuckoos in the same nest.—\r\n\r\n     I have written fortyfour articles for my appendix and\r\n     will continue whenever I am not otherwise engaged, so\r\n     as to save time at last.—I am sorry for the death of\r\n     poor Wickliffe but glad that his brother was with him at\r\n     New York previously, and that we, at least, have done\r\n     all that we could for him. MacGillivray is quite well,\r\n     and works very hard, poor fellow—I am glad of John's\r\n     repainting the head by VanDyke, two copies of such\r\n     heads are valuable to him, besides his improving by so\r\n     working—When Victor has left for this place, John must\r\n     pay much attention to the colourers and call also at the\r\n     bookbinder. Havell ought to exert himself in having some\r\n     4th vols; delivered as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n     My last letter which was written last Sunday, was put\r\n     too late in the office, which closed on that day at\r\n     two o'clock, and did not therefore leave this till four\r\n     o'clock on Monday afternoon; this one will have a better\r\n     chance, for I will take it myself to the general office.\r\n     I have seen no one hardly since my last, I am indeed\r\n     as busily engaged as ever, and rarely go to bed before\r\n     eleven—being with Mr. MacGillivray until generally past\r\n     ten, describing etc., I rise at four or earlier, he at\r\n     ten; but I go to bed at eleven, he at two. I discovered\r\n     that he was adverse to the examination of the intestinal\r\n     canals etc., because many of my birds which are common\r\n     to both countries will be published before his 2d vol.,\r\n     can now possibly be; but as soon as I told him that I\r\n     had already said in my introduction, that the anatomical\r\n     structure was declared to be _his_, he was much pleased\r\n     and began on the instant.\r\n\r\n     Today is very dismal, and it will rain probably until\r\n     night; I wish we had here some of the warm weather of\r\n     which dearest Mamma speaks. I have had but one walk to\r\n     Arthur's Seat, but now and then I stroll to the meadows\r\n     which are close to me, and now look well.—From the\r\n     window of my sitting room I overlook the garden of Mr.\r\n     Frazer our printer, and now and then speak to him there,\r\n     I have not yet however visited him.—I will recollect the\r\n     Queen's farthing when next I see Professor Wilson, but\r\n     doubt much if he will recollect the least idea of it.\r\n     Has Charley written or said anything to Victor about the\r\n     review of the work; remember me to Healey.—\r\n\r\n     I suppose that the crown of England sits very quietly\r\n     down, and that all was very superfine. I have not so\r\n     much as seen a paper since I left you.\r\n\r\n     God bless you all, dearest friends, and take good care\r\n     of Mamma and Maria,\r\n\r\n          Ever your firmly attached father and friend\r\n\r\n          J. J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n          No. 7 Archibald Place,\r\n          Lauriston.\r\n\r\nAudubon's fourth volume, the printing of which was announced in\r\nthis letter, was published in November, and at the conclusion of the\r\nintroduction he said:\r\n\r\n     I believe the time to be fast approaching when much of\r\n     the results obtained from the inspection of the exterior\r\n     alone will be laid aside; when museums filled with the\r\n     stuffed skins will be considered insufficient to afford\r\n     a knowledge of birds; and when the student will go forth\r\n     not only to observe the habits and haunts of animals,\r\n     but to procure specimens of them to be carefully\r\n     dissected.\r\n\r\nThese prophetic remarks, which were no doubt inspired by the studies\r\nof MacGillivray, have found ample justification in the later history\r\nof ornithology; to give a single illustration, it was through the aid\r\nof anatomy only, in this instance, of the vocal organs, that modern\r\nstudents have been able to define the true Passerine or Oscine birds,\r\nas distinguished from all others, and as the highest representatives of\r\nthe avian class.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1838, when Mrs. Audubon was still suffering from\r\nimpaired health, the naturalist paused in his work to indulge in a\r\nshort vacation, the first in many years. On September 14, he wrote to\r\nEdward Harris, who was then in Scotland:[151]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Edward Harris_\r\n\r\n          EDINBURGH, _14 Sep'., 1838_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\n     Not having heard anything from you in answer to my last,\r\n     I suppose that you may yet be away from Glasgow, but as\r\n     we ourselves are going off tomorrow to the \"Highlands,\"\r\n     with a view to be at Glasgow on Thursday next, I write\r\n     to you now, with the hope of meeting you _then_. Nothing\r\n     of importance has occurred here since my last, but _the\r\n     book_ has considerably swollen in its progress towards\r\n     completion.\r\n\r\n     We all unite in best wishes to you and I remain as ever\r\n     your most truly attached and sincere friend,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON\r\n\r\n     We intend being home again on Saturday next.\r\n\r\n          [Addressed] To EDWARD HARRIS Esqr.\r\n          Comrie's Royal Hotel,\r\n          Glasgow.\r\n\r\nWith MacGillivray as guide, Audubon and his family visited Stirling,\r\nDoun and Callander, where they \"marched in a body to the Falls of\r\nBracklin, guided by a rosy-cheeked Highland lassie, stopping now and\r\nthen by the way to pick up a wild flower,—a blue-bell, a 'gowan,' or a\r\ndog-rose, or to listen to the magpies and titmice.\" From Callander they\r\nascended to Loch Katrine, and explored the Trossachs, \"admired by many,\r\nchiefly or entirely on account of Scott's description of them\"; at\r\nthe tavern there, said Audubon, \"with that most curious innate desire\r\nwhich there is in us of becoming older, for the purpose of enjoying\r\nthe morrow, I went to rest, anxious to see the morn, and discover what\r\nexisted beyond the crags that had bounded my view.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the wild and beautiful scenes about Loch Katrine, which stirred\r\nthe naturalist's emotions and evoked the desire to remain until the\r\ncurtain of night had gradually and peacefully closed the landscape from\r\ntheir view, they proceeded to the rocky shores of Loch Lomond, where\r\nthey found \"a few small stone cabins, some fat bairns, abundance of\r\nale, and a sufficiency of capital whisky.\" After crossing to Tarbet\r\nand examining both the head and the foot of the lake, they went on from\r\nBalloch to Dumbarton by stage, and thence by steamer to Glasgow; there\r\nthey spent a few days, and returned to Edinburgh by way of Dumbarton\r\nand Lanark. Steamers and coaches, slow as they then were, were all too\r\nfast for Audubon on this journey, and he declared that if ever again he\r\nvisited the Highlands, it should be on foot, \"for no man, with nerve\r\nand will, and an admirer of the beauties of nature, can ever truly\r\nenjoy the pleasures of travelling, unless he proceed in this manner.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Audubon's health had not improved by the journey, for shortly\r\nafter their return she was again taken ill; she was placed in the\r\ncare of Dr. John Argyle Robertson, for whose efficient aid and \"kind\r\nand gentle treatment,\" said Audubon, \"we can never cease to cherish\r\nthe most lively feelings of affection.\" \"It is a curious part of\r\nmy history,\" he continues, \"that during the whole of my sojourn in\r\nBritain, none of the principal medical advisers whom we had occasion to\r\nemploy would receive any recompense from us.\"\r\n\r\nBy the 5th of November, 1838, but a few days after the issue of the\r\nfourth volume of his \"Biographies,\" the printing of the fifth and last\r\nhad already begun. The following letter[152] is interesting for its\r\npersonal details, and in showing that his confidence in the existence\r\nof the \"bird of Washington\"[153] had not been shaken:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Edward Harris_\r\n\r\n          EDINBURGH _December 19th., 1838_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND:\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the 13th. instant to Victor reached us\r\n     this morning, and glad were we all to hear from you.\r\n\r\n     My object in writing to you is, for the purpose of\r\n     assuring you that I feel great [pleasure] in preparing\r\n     a box of bird skins for you according to your desire. It\r\n     is true, however, that I am now on the eve of commencing\r\n     my synoptical arrangement of our birds, I shall not be\r\n     able to show you as many of my specimens [as] I could\r\n     otherwise have done, but you must take the will for the\r\n     deed. The Box will be taken as far as London by Victor,\r\n     who will leave us on the first of January. You will find\r\n     in it a list of the contents, and I trust such bird\r\n     skins as may answer your purpose well. Besides these\r\n     Victor will also attend to your request as soon as in\r\n     New York and will ship to you by way of Havre as you\r\n     direct.\r\n\r\n     I am glad that you should have seen what you conceive\r\n     to be the great rara avis F. Washingtonii. I am sorry\r\n     you could not have pocketed it, but who knows if it is\r\n     not left yet in store for you—and I to shoot a pair of\r\n     these noble birds at The West, and that, after having\r\n     satisfactorily examined its habits, its eggs, or its\r\n     young! _Bonaparte_, between you and I, is exceedingly\r\n     ignorant as regards our birds, as I found to my cost\r\n     when he was in London, and where he pumped me sadly too\r\n     much, but it is now over and I forgive him as I do all\r\n     others who have or who _may_ try to injure me.\r\n\r\n     John Bachman wrote to me that he had left in commission\r\n     to Trudeau, the purchase for me of a copy of Vieillot's\r\n     Oiseaux de l'Amérique Septentrionale, and also a copy\r\n     of Boié or Bojé work[154] on birds generally, but I have\r\n     received neither books or promises of them from Trudeau\r\n     as yet, perhaps you would undertake the task yourself,\r\n     and show to Havell as soon as possible, for I shall\r\n     be sadly in want of them in a few weeks more. I should\r\n     also like you to try to find Mr. Augustus Thorndike of\r\n     Boston, to whom Victor wrote a few days ago, with the\r\n     view to inquire from that Gentleman when he wished _his_\r\n     copy of the Birds of America to be delivered. Victor\r\n     addressed his letter to \"his Hotel\" or to the care\r\n     of the \"American Embassy.\" We are not sure, however,\r\n     whether he is in Paris at present, and let me know what\r\n     discoveries you have made as regards this.—Victor will\r\n     remain ten days in London and wishes you, should you\r\n     write to him there, to put your letter _under cover_ to\r\n     _Havell_ and request him to _keep_ it. Victor will write\r\n     you from thence.\r\n\r\n     I cannot account why Trudeau has not written to me in\r\n     answer to my last, now full two months old? Should\r\n     you _perchance_ discover a specimen of the Bird of\r\n     Washington in Paris and purchase the same, I should like\r\n     you to send it to me _on loan_ to enable me to compare\r\n     it with mine, and the Immature of the _F. Albicilla of\r\n     Europe_!\r\n\r\n     I have got twelve sheets of the 5th. Vol. of Biographies\r\n     already printed, and I expect to have quite finished by\r\n     the 1st. of April next. I have decided on the _Trichas_\r\n     resembling _Sylvia Philadelphia_ of Wilson. It is\r\n     a distinct species, but what will probably surprise\r\n     you more, the _S. Agilis_ of the same author is also\r\n     perfectly distinct from either. All this you will\r\n     plainly see when you read their separate descriptions\r\n     and compare the three species.\r\n\r\n     I wish you would ask Trudeau whether _he_ recollects\r\n     the specimen of an Eagle send by Townsend in his first\r\n     collection, numbering 54 and which the latter has\r\n     lost, though he considered it as a new species. It was\r\n     procured in California. Townsend speaks sorrowfully of\r\n     the loss of this specimen. It never came under my eye,\r\n     did it come under yours? Ask Trudeau whether he ever saw\r\n     my Hirundo Serripennis in America. Bachman wrote to me\r\n     that Trudeau thought he had in the skins of Frederick\r\n     Ward. I think Trudeau will be pleased with the anatomy\r\n     of our birds, as it opens misteries hitherto unknown\r\n     in connection with the relative affinities of some\r\n     species toward others and assists in the formation of\r\n     groups &c., in what some day or other, will be called a\r\n     _Natural arrangement_!\r\n\r\n     I wish I could have spent a few weeks in Paris with you\r\n     and Trudeau, as I readily imagine that some new species\r\n     of North American birds, may yet be found there unknown\r\n     to the World of Science. I have written to Mr. Chevalier\r\n     and to Townsend, but will not, I dare say, hear anything\r\n     more of the former until through Victor, who intends to\r\n     see him very shortly after his arrival in America.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Wife is much better than when you saw her, and\r\n     I hope that when once again she has been safely landed\r\n     on our shores and enjoyed the warmth of our own Summers,\r\n     her health will be quite restored.\r\n\r\n     The _Little_ Lucy has grown as fat as butter, and the\r\n     rest of us are well.\r\n\r\n     We all unite in kindest best wishes to you and to\r\n     Trudeau, and I remain as ever, my Dear Friend,\r\n\r\n          Yours,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n          6 Alva Street.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1839, Audubon's fifth and last volume of the _Ornithological\r\nBiography_, consisting of 704 pages, was issued. It was followed almost\r\nimmediately by _A Synopsis of the Birds of North America_, in which\r\nthe efficient aid of MacGillivray was again enlisted. On May 4 Audubon\r\nwrote to Havell that this work was in press and would be ready in about\r\na month's time; again, on the 30th of June he announced that it was\r\nfinished and in the hands of the binder. With this methodical catalogue\r\nof the birds of North America then known and described, to the number\r\nof 491, fifty-two of which were new, Audubon's life and labors in\r\nEngland were brought to a close.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to the last volume of his \"Biographies\" begins as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     How often, Good Reader, I have longed to see the day\r\n     on which my labours should be brought to an end! Many\r\n     times, when I had laid myself down in the deepest\r\n     recesses of the western forests, have I been suddenly\r\n     awakened by the apparition of dismal prospects that\r\n     have presented themselves to my mind. Now, sickness,\r\n     methought, had seized me with burning hand, and hurried\r\n     me away, in spite of all my fond wishes, from those\r\n     wild woods in which I had so long lingered, to increase\r\n     my knowledge of the objects which they offered to my\r\n     view. Poverty, too, at times walked hand in hand with\r\n     me, and on more than one occasion urged me to cast away\r\n     my pencils, destroy my drawings, abandon my journals,\r\n     change my ideas, and return to the world.\r\n\r\nLater on he says: \"You may well imagine how happy I am at this moment,\r\nwhen ... I find my journeys all finished, my anxieties vanished, my\r\nmission accomplished;\" and he concludes: \"I have pleasure in saying\r\nthat my enemies have been few, and my friends numerous. May the God\r\nwho granted me life, industry, and perseverance to accomplish my task,\r\nforgive the former, and forever bless the latter!\"\r\n\r\nAudubon's introductions to the five volumes of his \"Biographies,\" from\r\nwhich we have frequently quoted, are characteristic; in them he cheers\r\nhis subscribers, calls all his helpers and correspondents by name,\r\nand takes the public into his confidence by recording the acts which\r\nmarked the steady progress of his work. Frequent appeals to the \"good\"\r\nand \"gentle reader\" have gone out of fashion, but in this instance\r\nthey seem in keeping with the style and character of the man, and they\r\nwere not made in vain. Audubon's belief in his mission was so plainly\r\nsincere, his power so manifest and his enthusiasm so ardent, that there\r\nwere few who did not gladly acclaim the extraordinary success of the\r\nman who twelve years before had landed in Liverpool poor and unknown.\r\n\r\nIn the winter and spring of 1839, while Audubon was engaged in\r\nEdinburgh and Victor was in America, the settlement of his business\r\naffairs in London was entrusted mainly to Robert Havell, his engraver.\r\nAt that time Havell was also pulling up roots, for he had caught the\r\nspirit of his patron and had decided to emigrate with his family to\r\nthe United States; this involved disposing of his stock and breaking\r\nup his engraving and printing establishment at 77 Oxford Street.\r\nHavell had acquired distinction as well as a competence through his\r\nlong engagement with Audubon, and being then in his forty-sixth year,\r\nhe doubtless looked to America as a field for the fuller expression\r\nof his artistic aspirations and talents. How anxious Audubon was at\r\nthis juncture regarding the disposition of the residual stock of his\r\nplates, his drawings, and his books, then in Havell's hands, is seen by\r\nthe following letter,[155] written at Edinburgh, in the winter of this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Robert Havell_\r\n\r\n          EDINBURGH, _Feb. 20th, Monday, 1839._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. HAVELL\r\n\r\n     I perceive by the date of your letter of the 16th\r\n     instant that you must have been some days beyond my\r\n     expectations, in the receiving of my parcel to you, and\r\n     that on that account my letter of Saturday last crossed\r\n     yours of the same date. I thank you for what you say as\r\n     regards the balance in my favor at Wright and Co.\r\n\r\n     Does Henry sail from _London Docks_ or from\r\n     _Portsmouth_? and pray what is the name of the Captain\r\n     of the \"Wellington\"? I do not precisely understand what\r\n     you mean by the _loose sets_ which you desire to know\r\n     how they should be packed? let me hear what they are and\r\n     how many of them by return of mail. The _five_ perfect\r\n     sets I think might all go into one case, tinned as\r\n     usual and insured of course to the full amount of their\r\n     value, as well as all others and to which I pray you to\r\n     attend as if for your own self. It is impossible for me\r\n     to go to London at present and indeed I cannot exactly\r\n     tell when I will, and I trust to you entirely for the\r\n     seeing that all the volumes are fair and good and passed\r\n     through _your own_ inspection of them before they are\r\n     packed. No volumes of Biographies must be put in the\r\n     same boxes.\r\n\r\n     When you have disposed of your business, what will\r\n     you do with what you have on hand belonging to us?\r\n     This requires an answer from you at once. You have a\r\n     great number of volumes of Biographies, Pictures, &c.\r\n     &c., a regular list of which you ought to send me. I\r\n     cannot yet say when the 5th vol. of Biographies will\r\n     be finished, but will let you know as soon as I can.\r\n     I received yesterday morning a letter from a gentleman\r\n     who has procured a copy of the work through Mr. Eame the\r\n     bookseller, he says that he has called upon you to say\r\n     that he is missing _one plate_ and begs to have a copy\r\n     of the plate struck and remitted to Mr. Eame who will\r\n     pay you whatever price the extra trouble on this account\r\n     may amount to, but he does not say what plate it is,\r\n     and I therefor suppose that you do? If so as he is the\r\n     brother-in-law of Mr. Walker of Ravensfield Park, one\r\n     of our _good_ subscribers I would say do it for him! My\r\n     wife begs of you to save all the loose prints which were\r\n     returned to you by our son Victor, as well as any others\r\n     whatever, perhaps among them you might find one to send\r\n     Mr. Eame's subscriber?\r\n\r\n     On the 4th of this month the 'Great Western' was nearly\r\n     half way across the Atlantic!! Sir William Jardine has\r\n     published a capital review of the work! What a strange\r\n     world we do learn in! Be sure to let me know about the\r\n     original drawings at Henry's, if he has finished them,\r\n     where they are &c. &c. We all remain as usual with kind\r\n     good wishes to you all,\r\n\r\n          Your friend\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n          6 Alva St.\r\n\r\n          [Superscribed]\r\n          ROBERT HAVELL Esq.\r\n          Engraver.\r\n          77 Oxford st\r\n          London.\r\n\r\nHow fully Audubon's injunctions in regard to his residual stock, and\r\nparticularly to scattered plates of the _Birds_, were followed, is\r\nnot known, but it is certain that a part of this residuum remained in\r\nEngland, where it is occasionally turned up even at the present day.\r\nIn a considerable number of the original plates which were found in\r\na bookshop in New Oxford Street in August, 1912, twelve were in the\r\nuncolored state, and several had the appearance of rejects; moreover,\r\nin a collection of these plates received from England in 1910, there\r\nwere nine copies of the same subject, the Painted Bunting (No. 11,\r\nPlate 53). Though a complete set of the plain plates is known,[156] and\r\na considerable number were probably dispersed in America, they are very\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nAudubon wrote to Havell again on the 13th of March, when he complained\r\nof the gross mistakes made by the \"idle rascals\" who were employed in\r\nfilling orders in his shop, and who had so sadly mixed matters that no\r\nless than twelve numbers of his _Birds_ had come back to him, some of\r\nthem containing one, three, and five copies of the same plate, instead\r\nof a \"Number,\" and mixtures of the most incongruous sort; he thought\r\nthat \"a clever young man as a clerk was worth a hundred thick heads,\"\r\nand begged Havell again to send him \"a correct list of what he shipped\r\nto America on his account, and that list not made by any other person\r\nthan either himself or Mrs. Havell.\" His next injunction, on May 4,\r\nwas to insure his copper-plates of _The Birds of America_ for £5,000,\r\nand to send them to either Victor Audubon or Mr. N. Berthoud, Number\r\n2 Hanover Street, New York. At that moment Audubon was planning to\r\nreturn to America with his family by the _Great Western_ on July 6. In\r\nwriting again on June 30, he remarked that he was not at all certain\r\nthat Havell, who was then visiting at his native Reading, in Berkshire,\r\nwould really sail on the 25th of July, since he had already postponed\r\nthe journey so many times; he added that it would not even surprise him\r\nif his work on the _Quadrupeds_ of America might not be out before they\r\ncould fish and shoot together in his \"native land.\"\r\n\r\nHavell eventually came to America with his wife and daughter on the\r\nship _Wellington_, in September, 1839; they landed at New York after\r\nthe 15th of that month, and for a time were the guests of the Audubons\r\nat Number 86 White Street. His brother, Henry,[157] who visited the\r\nUnited States in 1829, returned at about this time and established a\r\nprint shop in Broadway, New York, but according to Robert's biographer,\r\nhis enterprise was ruined by a fire, when he went back to England and\r\nhe died there about 1840. After a brief residence in Brooklyn, Robert\r\nHavell settled at Sing Sing, now Ossining, at a beautiful spot on\r\nthe Hudson, overlooking the Palisades, which he named \"Rocky Mount.\"\r\nThere he devoted himself with characteristic energy to painting and\r\nsketching, but he also engraved and published a number of excellent\r\nviews of his favorite river, the Hudson, as well as of New York and\r\nother American cities. In 1857 he established himself at Tarrytown,\r\nwhere he built a house and studio, and where in his later years he\r\nproduced many meritorious works in oils. \"He never tired,\" says his\r\nbiographer, \"of the great, broad, sweeping Hudson, and propped up in\r\nbed, that he might gaze at will on this mighty river,\" he died at the\r\nage of eighty-five, November 11, 1878.[158]\r\n\r\nHavell has been described as quite the opposite of Audubon in many\r\nof his characteristics, calm, deliberate, not easily discouraged, and\r\nfully his equal in industry, perseverance and determination. Audubon\r\nsometimes complained of his friend's lax business habits, but their\r\nlong sustained and cordial relations were never broken during life,\r\nand their mutual debt was great. The engraver's first son, who lived\r\nbut a year, was named Robert Audubon, and the naturalist, who was\r\nhis godfather, held the child at its baptism at old St. James Church,\r\nOxford Street, in 1827. A descendant of Luke Havell, who was a drawing\r\nmaster at Reading, uncle of Robert the second, possesses a silver\r\nloving-cup which Audubon presented to his engraver upon the completion\r\nof the second volume of his illustrations; it is inscribed \"To Robert\r\nHavell, from his friend J. J. A. 1834.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the size of Audubon's plates, which required for\r\nthe portrayal of his largest subjects, such as the Whooping Crane or\r\nWild Turkey, an area of no less than five square feet, it will be\r\nseen that his engraver was compelled to adopt the most expeditious\r\nmethods. This and kindred difficulties were overcome by Havell's\r\nskillful union of aquatint with etching and line engraving, but some\r\nof his smaller figures, as the Snow Birds (Plate 13), appear to have\r\nbeen etched in the usual way, with but slight use of either aquatint,\r\ndry-point or burin. In aquatinting the plate was usually bitten to the\r\ndesired depth for the softer shading of feathers or foliage, or for\r\nthe entire expression of sky, water or landscape. Says George Alfred\r\nWilliams:[159]\r\n\r\n     Aquatint proper consists entirely of gradations of tone\r\n     produced by biting with aquafortis into the copper\r\n     through a resinous ground broken into a multitude\r\n     of fine granules, that render the personal touch\r\n     practically negligible, and in consideration of this we\r\n     can appreciate the exceptionally skillful use Havell,\r\n     Junior, made of the difficult process. The graining of\r\n     the aquatint grounds is produced by allowing fine dust\r\n     particles to settle upon the freshly prepared plate. It\r\n     is to these grainings of different degrees of fineness\r\n     that the engraver must look for the subtlety of the\r\n     tonal surfaces, but strength is obtained usually through\r\n     the use of the etched line. The chief limitation of the\r\n     aquatint process lies in the great difficulty of getting\r\n     more than a few differences of shade, as the ground\r\n     goes to pieces rather rapidly under successive bitings,\r\n     and the transitions from one tone to another are very\r\n     few, so that half tones are not readily obtainable.\r\n     It is in the economical use of these half tones that\r\n     Havell, Junior, achieved so much and thereby produced a\r\n     chiaroscuro seldom, if ever, equaled in aquatint.\r\n\r\nArtists have sometimes frowned upon this combination of aquatint with\r\nother forms of engraving, especially when executed with the burin, for\r\n\"like the permanent misery of a quarrelling married couple, they may\r\nruin everything with discord\"; but any such lack of harmony, when not\r\novercome by Havell's skill, was usually completely subdued by the color\r\nwhich was subsequently applied to the printed sheet. This is seen by\r\na comparison of the plain proof of such an elaborate plate as that of\r\nthe rattlesnake attacking the mocking birds (Plate xxi) with the result\r\nattained in the finished impression. In replying to a criticism of\r\nHavell's work in 1830, Audubon expressed his conviction that \"no birds\r\nwere ever so beautifully and softly represented on copper,\" and any\r\nhardness, which his plates rarely showed, was not due to aquatinting,\r\nthe inherent quality of which is softness. To quote our authority\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n     In Havell's hands aquatint gave the essential structure\r\n     of forms by a judicious use of the process called\r\n     \"feathering.\" This he often did upon the bare copper\r\n     plate without a ground, allowing the acid to bite its\r\n     own granular surface. In this way he produced the soft\r\n     gradations and telling accents so necessary to the\r\n     portrayal of birds, but by a further judicious use of\r\n     line the accurate forms of both bird and plant life were\r\n     given with great force and delicacy.\r\n\r\nWhen Audubon first proposed to present the Congressional Library at\r\nWashington with a copy of his _Birds_, he asked Havell to do all the\r\ncoloring himself; Havell\r\n\r\n     colored his prints in the usual manner by flowing washes\r\n     of pure water-color tints over the monochrome proof\r\n     which was printed from the copper plate. In this phase\r\n     of the process the great charm of his genuine talent\r\n     for water-color painting asserted itself. Aside from\r\n     the first crude washes, put on by artists or colorists\r\n     employed for the purpose, he himself applied the salient\r\n     tones and all the more delicate tints.\r\n\r\nMuch misunderstanding has arisen in regard to the engraving and\r\npublication of Audubon's earlier plates owing to the complex relations\r\nwhich existed between Lizars, the two Havells of the same name,\r\nand the naturalist himself; this involved the reissue of the first\r\ntwo numbers of the work, and a confusing series of legends upon the\r\nplates themselves, occasioned partly by a division of labor between\r\nfather and son, and by the death of Robert Havell, Senior, in 1832.\r\nThe errors into which some commentators have fallen, however, are\r\ndue to their examination of but one set of plates. The account which\r\nfollows is based upon a collation of complete copies at the British\r\nMuseum, the Radcliffe Library, Oxford, the Jardin des Plantes, Paris,\r\nand the Boston Society of Natural History, and of numerous scattered\r\nplates. Lizars engraved the first ten plates only of the large folio,\r\nbut before the summer of 1827 a considerable number of these early\r\nimpressions had been distributed. The Havells, as we have seen, started\r\nthe work anew, and Robert, the younger, retouched the greater part of\r\nLizars' plates, so that their reissue in London constitutes for the\r\nbibliophile a second, and in some cases a third, edition. Moreover,\r\nthe plates which were eventually executed by the younger Havell, to the\r\nnumber of 425, were repeatedly printed from to meet the requirements of\r\nnew subscribers; on such occasions errors were corrected, minor changes\r\nin the artist's or engraver's name introduced, and the nomenclature\r\nof the birds and plants more or less completely revised. Frequently\r\nthe Whatman water-marks, or, indirectly, Audubon's titles, postdate\r\nthe year of publication as printed on the plate itself. Conflicting\r\nlegends, particularly on the earlier plates, which have often puzzled\r\ncollectors, are mainly due to one or another of the conditions named.\r\nNearly every plate underwent alterations of some sort, but the various\r\nlegends show conclusively whether the print belongs to a first or a\r\nsubsequent impression. In the British Museum copy, the younger Havell's\r\nfirst independent legend appears on Plate lxxvi (Virginia Partridge),\r\nas \"Engraved, Printed, & Coloured by R. Havell Junr. 1830.\" The word\r\n\"London\" was later added, but was eventually discarded. After the\r\nsenior Havell's death in 1832, the son naturally dropped the suffix\r\nfrom his own name; thereafter his brief designation of name and date\r\nbecame gradually stereotyped. It should be noticed, however, that when\r\nRobert Havell needed to reprint from plates which were executed before\r\nhis father's death, he would frequently remove only the \"Junior,\" and\r\nlet the original date stand, so that legends like the following are not\r\nuncommon: \"Engraved, Printed, & Coloured by R. Havell, —— London—1831\";\r\nto avoid the lacuna, designation of place and date were, at times,\r\nerased also. The naturalist's name underwent a different evolution on\r\nthe plates, but after 1830, the date of his election to membership in\r\nthe Royal Society, his designation gradually settled into the phrase:\r\n\"Drawn from nature by J.J. Audubon, F.L.S. F.R.S.\" (as in Plate lxxxi,\r\n1830); accordingly, all plates which bear these titles, but an earlier\r\ndate, are second or later editions. The previous hints, with examples\r\nto be given presently, will enable collectors to determine whether a\r\ngiven plate is a first or subsequent impression.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _PLATE CCCI_\r\n    _Canvas backed Duck_\r\n    FULIGULA VALLISNERIA,\r\n    Steph. _1 2 Male, 3 Female_\r\n    View of Baltimore\r\n\r\n    Drawn from nature by J.J. Audubon F.R.S. F.L.S.\r\n    Engraved Printed & Coloured by R. Havell. 1836]\r\n\r\nLizars' first edition of plates, Numbers i to x, bore no dates, and,\r\nso far as known, the first date of the entire series was \"1828,\"\r\nwhich was added to Plate 31 (the White-headed Eagle), but was erased\r\nfrom later issues. When Robert Havell, Junior, retouched Lizar's\r\nengraving of the Turkey Hen (No. II, Plate vi), he added the date\r\n\"1829,\" but in a third or later edition the name was changed and the\r\ndate removed. This same date appears also on the retouched Plate ii,\r\nof the Yellow-billed Cuckoo, and on that of the Purple Grackle or Crow\r\nBlackbird (Plate vii). A curious error crept into the first impressions\r\nof the former plate, which was mislabeled \"Black-billed Cuckoo,\" a bird\r\nthen recognized as quite distinct.[160] Plates xxxi to lxxv (1828-29)\r\nwere all dated in the first issue, and bore the names of both Havells;\r\nthe legends are: \"Engraved, Printed & Coloured by R. Havell & Son,\r\nLondon, 1828,\" and \"Engraved by Robt. Havell, Junr. Printed & Coloured\r\nby R. Havell Senr. London, 1828,\" or \"1829\" (British Museum copy),\r\nbut when later printed by Robert, the younger, the dates were erased.\r\nAll subsequent dating of the plates was somewhat irregular until 1834\r\n(Plate ccii), but from that point to the end of the series, the year\r\nof issue was consistently added to each plate. Ornithologists are\r\nspecially interested in the time of publication, since forty-seven new\r\nspecific names occur on Audubon's large plates, and should date from\r\nthem and not from the letterpress which followed.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate what has been said of successive editions of Audubon's\r\nplates, we shall give the legends of two or three of the most famous,\r\ntaken from copies in the British Museum and Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory libraries or from detached plates obtained in London, in 1903:\r\n\r\n     Plate i (1st edit., Lizars; Brit.

Havell.\"\r\n\r\nPlates which were wholly the work of Lizars have naturally become\r\nextremely rare; they were evidently disregarded by Audubon when he\r\nrecorded on July 2, 1827, that he had given Mr. Children a proof\r\nof his first number, which he called \"the first in existence,\" and\r\ndeclared that the two guineas then received was the first money that\r\nhad been returned to his hands. Lizars' initial number had actually\r\nbeen finished in the previous winter, and a copy of this is recorded\r\nas having been given to the daughter of Sir Walter Scott on the 9th of\r\nMarch, 1827.\r\n\r\nWhen Audubon had finally closed all his business affairs in Edinburgh\r\nand London, late in the summer of 1839, he returned to America, with\r\nthe remaining members of his family, and settled in New York, where\r\nhe purchased a house at Number 84 White Street, then in the uptown\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous writer in the London _Athenæum_[161] in giving a final\r\nreview of Audubon's labors in 1839, paid this interesting tribute:\r\n\r\n     It seems but as yesterday that we were walking about\r\n     with a transatlantic stranger, picturesque enough in his\r\n     appearance and garb, to arrest the eye of every passing\r\n     gazer; a tall stalwart man, with hair sufficiently long\r\n     to qualify him to serve as a model to Gray's \"Bard,\" and\r\n     trousers ample almost as petticoats of \"good Harmony\r\n     cloth,\" so absorbed in the enthusiastic prosecution\r\n     of his gigantic plan—a life's labour—as to be heedless\r\n     of the singularity of those meteoric locks, and those\r\n     liberal nether garments. Some dozen of years, however,\r\n     have elapsed since that day; the American Woodsman's\r\n     hair—long since cut short—has grown white; his\r\n     magnificent undertaking is completed, and he is now on\r\n     the point of quitting England, to settle himself for the\r\n     remainder of his days whether by the side of a bayou, in\r\n     some forest clearing, or as an inhabitant of one of the\r\n     American cities which have learned to know his value,\r\n     report saith not.\r\n\r\n     We shake hands with the author, tendering him our hearty\r\n     congratulations on the completion of a task almost as\r\n     arduous as has ever been proposed to a literary man....\r\n\r\n     The confidential simplicity of Mr. Audubon's own\r\n     prefaces would make yet more personal leave-takings\r\n     and farewells, on the critic's part, natural and\r\n     graceful,—but it must suffice to say, that few have\r\n     quitted England, carrying with them a larger portion of\r\n     honest regard and sincere good wishes.\r\n\r\nPossibly it was the same writer who gave this striking picture of\r\nAudubon in the pages of the same journal, thirty years later:[162]\r\n\r\n     We can remember when his portfolio excited delight\r\n     in Edinburgh, London, and Paris, rivalling in smaller\r\n     circles a new Waverley novel. The man also was not a\r\n     man to be seen and forgotten, or passed on the pavement\r\n     without glances of surprise and scrutiny. The tall\r\n     and somewhat stooping form, the clothes not made by a\r\n     West-end but by a Far West tailor, the steady, rapid,\r\n     springing step, the long hair, the aquiline features,\r\n     and the glowing angry eyes,—the expression of a handsome\r\n     man conscious of ceasing to be young, and an air and\r\n     manner which told you that whoever you might be he was\r\n     John Audubon, will never be forgotten by anyone who knew\r\n     or saw him.\r\n\r\nWe will add to this the musings of an anonymous American writer[163] in\r\nthe _North American Review_ for the following year (1840):\r\n\r\n     It must have been with mingled and varied feelings\r\n     that Audubon published his concluding volume. He was\r\n     sure then that he had raised an imperishable monument\r\n     to commemorate his own renown. All anxieties and fears\r\n     which overshadowed his work in its beginning had passed\r\n     away. The prophecies of kind but overprudent friends,\r\n     who did not understand his self-sustaining energy, had\r\n     proved untrue; the malicious hope of his enemies, for\r\n     even the gentle lover of nature has enemies,—had been\r\n     disappointed; he had secured a commanding place in the\r\n     respect and gratitude of men; he had secured a treasure\r\n     of rich and glowing recollections, to warm his own heart\r\n     in his declining years, and to kindle enthusiasm in his\r\n     children's children....\r\n\r\n     On the other hand he had lost an employment which\r\n     for years had kept all the powers of body and mind\r\n     in healthy though intense exertion; whatever else he\r\n     might do, the great work of his intellectual life was\r\n     finished.... His trumpet of victory at the result must\r\n     have given an uncertain sound, partly exulting in his\r\n     success, and partly lamenting that his great work was\r\n     finished.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked, how many complete sets of Audubon's folio of\r\n_The Birds of America_ were distributed, and how many are in existence\r\ntoday. No definite answer can be given to either question. His final\r\nlists, appended to the last volume of his \"Biographies\" in 1839, and\r\nreproduced in Appendix III to the present work, gave the number of\r\nstanding names as 161 (calling for 166 copies), of which 79 (with 84\r\ncopies) pertained to Europe, and 82 were American; inasmuch as 118\r\nsubscribers had dropped off, with incompleted sets on their hands, this\r\nbrought the total number of original patrons at that time to 279, and\r\nthe number of copies which had been originally ordered to 284. On the\r\nother hand, the following advertisement, evidently from the hand of\r\nAudubon himself, appeared in _The Athenæum_, under date of \"London,\r\nNovember 1, 1837,\" and was reprinted in America a few weeks later:[164]\r\n\r\n     The number of perfect copies at present subscribed\r\n     for does not exceed 190, of which upwards of 80 are\r\n     subscribed for in America; and the expense of getting\r\n     them up is so great, that not more than ten or fifteen\r\n     copies, above the number subscribed for, will be\r\n     prepared.\r\n\r\n     The Establishment necessary for its publication will\r\n     be broken up when the last Number is coloured; and any\r\n     application for the Work must be made to the Author, 4,\r\n     Wimpole—street, London; or Mr. R. Havell, Engraver, 77\r\n     Oxford—street, before the first of May next, as after\r\n     that time no subscription can be received.\r\n\r\nAssuming that Audubon's final published lists, calling for 166 copies,\r\nwere correct, and that ten additional sets were prepared, this would\r\nbring the total original number known to have been complete to 176,\r\nwhich agrees with an estimate attributed to Victor Audubon, who once\r\nexpressed the belief that \"about 175 copies\" were in existence, of\r\nwhich about 80 were in America.[165] It is probable, however, that of\r\nthe 118 persons who allowed their subscriptions to lapse, a number\r\ncompleted their sets from the residual stock, which must have been\r\ngreat, though the later plates would be the hardest to obtain; in this\r\nevent the number of perfect sets of Audubon's _Birds_ probably never\r\nexceeded 190 or 200.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of a well known Philadelphia bookshop[166] has stated\r\nthat during his experience as an antiquary, he has had personal\r\nknowledge of forty or fifty copies of the folio edition of Audubon's\r\n_Birds_ in America, and he thought it probable that a single New\r\nEngland print dealer, in the course of twenty years, had broken up\r\nthirty or forty volumes for the purpose of selling the plates. This\r\nis not surprising, since from the sale of a single volume upwards of\r\n$1,500 might be realized in this way, but no reputable dealer would now\r\nthink of breaking up an unimpaired set.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruthven Deane, who has compiled a careful record of copies of _The\r\nBirds of America_ known to exist in the United States, recorded in\r\n1908 that he had ascertained the resting-place of seventy-five sets\r\nwhich, with few exceptions, were complete and in good condition. \"A set\r\nin the library of the Mechanics-Mercantile Institute, San Francisco,\r\nCalifornia, which had been there for some thirty years, and another\r\nset in the San Francisco Art Association, presented in 1894 by Mr.\r\nEdward F. Searles, Methuen, Massachusetts, were both destroyed by\r\nthe disastrous earthquake and fire which visited that city April 18,\r\n1906.\"[167]\r\n\r\nAudubon's own copy of his _Birds_, the plates of which were naturally\r\nselected with the greatest care, was sold by Mrs. Audubon after the\r\ndeath of her last surviving son, in 1862, to John T. Johnson, of New\r\nYork, for $1,200; the subsequent history of these volumes has not been\r\ntraced. Havell brought with him to America a copy, every plate of which\r\nis said to have been selected by himself, and it is undoubtedly one of\r\nthe finest sets in existence. It passed from the family's possession\r\nto the hands of the publishers and booksellers, Messrs. C. S. Francis\r\n& Company, of 554 Broadway, New York, who in 1856 had charge of the\r\nsale of all of Audubon's works,[168] and was later purchased by Dr. W.\r\nGurdon Russell, of Hartford, Connecticut, who presented it to Trinity\r\nCollege, July 10, 1900.[169]\r\n\r\nAfter recording the facts of the case, so far as they have been\r\nascertained, the following extract from the minutes of a meeting of the\r\nNew York Historical Society, held October 3, 1865, will be read with\r\ninterest:[170]\r\n\r\n     The Librarian presented the following copy of a\r\n     manuscript memorandum preserved in the first volume of\r\n     Audubon's Ornithological Biography, formerly belonging\r\n     to the late J. Prescott Hall,[171] and now in possession\r\n     of David G. Francis, Esq.:\r\n\r\n     \"This work is presented to J. Prescott Hall by his poor\r\n     Friend and sincerely attached servant\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON\"\r\n\r\n     \"New York April 4, 1844.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr Audubon told me in the year 184— that he did not\r\n     sell more than 40 copies of his great work in England,\r\n     Ireland, Scotland, and France, of which Louis Phillippe\r\n     took 10.\r\n\r\n     \"The following received their copies but never paid\r\n     for them: George IV., Dutchess of Clarence, Marquis of\r\n     Londonderry, Princess of Hesse Homburg.\r\n\r\n     \"An Irish lord whose name he would not give, took two\r\n     copies and paid for neither. Rothschild paid for his\r\n     copy, but with great reluctance.\r\n\r\n     \"He further said that he sold 75 copies in America, 26\r\n     in New York and 24 in Boston; that the work cost him\r\n     £27,000 and that he lost $25,000 by it.\r\n\r\n     \"He said that Louis Phillippe offered to subscribe for\r\n     100 copies if he would publish the work in Paris. This\r\n     he found could not be done, as it would have required\r\n     40 years to finish it as things were then in Paris. Of\r\n     this conversation I made a memorandum at the time which\r\n     I read over to Mr. Audubon and he pronounced it correct.\r\n\r\n          \"J. PRESCOTT HALL.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the subscription of Rothschild the following account of\r\nhis interview with the famous banker has been recorded by Audubon\r\nhimself.[172] The naturalist, it appears, received a letter to Baron\r\nRothschild from the American banking-house of Prime, Ward & King,\r\nand presented it in the summer of 1834. The banker was not in when\r\nAudubon and his son, Victor, called upon him, but \"soon a corpulent man\r\nappeared, hitching up his trousers, and a face red with the exertion\r\nof walking, and without noticing any one present, dropped his fat\r\nbody into a comfortable chair, as if caring for no one else in this\r\nwide world but himself.\" When Audubon presented his credentials, the\r\nbanker asked: \"Is this a letter of business, or is it a mere letter of\r\nintroduction?'\" As Audubon had not read the letter, he was obliged to\r\nanswer rather awkwardly that he could not tell. \"The banker then opened\r\nthe letter, read it with the manner of one who was looking only at\r\nthe temporal side of things, and after reading it said, 'This is only\r\na letter of introduction, and I expect from its contents that you are\r\nthe publisher of some book or other and need my subscription.'\" Audubon\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n     Had a man the size of a mountain spoken to me in that\r\n     arrogant style in America I should have indignantly\r\n     resented it; but where I then was it seemed best to\r\n     swallow and digest it as well as I could. So in reply\r\n     ... I said I should be _honored_ by his subscription to\r\n     the \"Birds of America.\" \"Sir,\" he said, \"I never sign\r\n     my name to any subscription list, but you may send in\r\n     your work and I will pay for a copy of it. Gentlemen,\r\n     I am busy, I wish you good morning.\" We were busy men,\r\n     too, and so bowing respectfully, we retired, pretty well\r\n     satisfied with the small slice of his opulence which our\r\n     labor was likely to obtain.\r\n\r\n     A few days afterwards I sent the first volume of my\r\n     work half bound, and all the numbers besides, then\r\n     published. On seeing them we were told that he ordered\r\n     the bearer to take them to his house, which was done\r\n     directly. Number after number was sent and delivered\r\n     to the Baron, and after eight or ten months my son made\r\n     out his account and sent it by Mr. Havell, my engraver,\r\n     to his banking-house. The Baron looked at it with\r\n     amazement, and cried out, \"What, a hundred pounds for\r\n     birds! Why, sir, I will give you five pounds, and not a\r\n     farthing more!\" Representations were made to him of the\r\n     magnificence and expense of the work, and how pleased\r\n     his Baroness and wealthy children would be to have\r\n     a copy; but the great financier was unrelenting. The\r\n     copy of the work was actually sent back to Mr. Havell's\r\n     shop, and as I found that instituting legal proceedings\r\n     against him would cost more than it would come to, I\r\n     kept the work, and afterwards sold it to a man with\r\n     less money but a nobler heart. What a distance there is\r\n     between two such men as Baron Rothschild of London and\r\n     the merchant of Savannah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nNEW ENTERPRISES AND LIFE AT \"MINNIE'S LAND\"\r\n\r\n     Settlement in New York—The _Birds_ in miniature,\r\n     and work on the _Quadrupeds_—Marriage of Victor\r\n     Audubon—Coöperation of Bachman in the _Quadrupeds_\r\n     secured—Prospectuses—History of the octavo edition\r\n     of the _Birds_—Baird's enthusiasm and efficient\r\n     aid—Parkman's wren—Baird's visit to Audubon in New\r\n     York—\"Look out for Martens!\" and wildcats—New home on\r\n     the Hudson—Godwin's pilgrimage to \"Minnie's Land\" in\r\n     1842.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter thirteen years of unmitigated labor, Audubon could have basked\r\nin a fame already secure, and could have enjoyed, for a time at least,\r\na leisure handsomely earned. But no sooner had he settled in New\r\nYork than he entered upon two formidable tasks: one of these was the\r\ncomplete revision of his _Birds of America_, to be issued with its text\r\nin \"miniature,\" as its reduced form was sometimes described; the other,\r\nwhich he did not live to see brought to completion, was an elaborate\r\nwork on the _Quadrupeds of North America_, eventually carried forward\r\nin collaboration with the Reverend John Bachman.\r\n\r\nIn his confident and characteristic manner, Audubon at once issued a\r\n\"Prospectus\" of both these undertakings. The more cautious Bachman,\r\nin writing on September 13, 1839, to congratulate him upon their safe\r\nreturn, \"in spite of storms, calms, and hurricane,\" said:\r\n\r\n     I am glad that you are about to do something with regard\r\n     to the \"_Small Edition of Birds_.\" But are you not\r\n     too fast in issuing your prospectus of _The Birds and\r\n     Quadrupeds_, without having numbers of both works, by\r\n     which the public can judge of their merits? My idea,\r\n     in regard to the latter, is that you should carefully\r\n     get up, in your best style, a volume about the size of\r\n     \"Holbrook's Reptiles.\" This would enable you to decide\r\n     on the terms of the book, I think that two thousand\r\n     subscribers at $1.00 for each number, might be obtained.\r\n     But it must be no half-way affair.\r\n\r\n     The animals have never been carefully described, and\r\n     you will find difficulties at every step. Books cannot\r\n     aid you much. Long journeys will have to be undertaken.\r\n     Several species remain to be added and their habits\r\n     ascertained. The drawings you can easily make, if you\r\n     can procure the specimens. I wish I had you here, if\r\n     only for two days. I think that I have studied the\r\n     subject more than you have. You will be bothered with\r\n     the Wolves and the Foxes, to begin with. I have two new\r\n     species of Bats and Shrews to add. The Western Deer are\r\n     no joke, and the ever varying Squirrels seem sent by\r\n     Satan himself, to puzzle the Naturalists.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this letter that Audubon was then intending to\r\nproceed with the work on the _Quadrupeds_ alone and that Bachman's\r\nactive coöperation was secured later. On September 15, shortly after\r\nhis return to America, he wrote to Thomas M. Brewer on this subject as\r\nfollows:[173]\r\n\r\n     Now that I am about to commence the publication of\r\n     the _Quadrupeds of North America_, I will expect your\r\n     assistance in the procuring for me of all such subjects\r\n     as may easily be obtained around you. John Bachman\r\n     is about to give the whole of his collections and his\r\n     notes to me; and as I intend to open a pretty general\r\n     correspondence in different parts of the Union, I\r\n     trust to be enabled to proceed roundly on this fresh\r\n     undertaking.\r\n\r\nVictor Gifford Audubon, who had preceded his father to America early in\r\n1839, was married in that year to Mary Eliza, second daughter of John\r\nand Harriet Bachman. This double union of the two naturalists' families\r\ncalled forth mutual congratulations, but Bachman, who was inconsolable\r\nat the departure of his children, preferred to talk of birds: \"By that\r\ntime,\" said he, \"four or five numbers [of the 'Small Edition of the\r\nBirds'] are published, you may turn over the work to your sons; but,\r\ntill then, you should carefully review every page and plate. The next\r\nthing will be to get subscribers. This would be purgatory to me; but\r\nit is necessary to success. While drumming up subscribers, you may\r\nobtain specimens for the Quadrupeds.\" When writing again January 13,\r\n1840, Bachman, whose cooperation in the proposed work had been sought,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n     The descriptions in the \"Small Edition of Birds\" will\r\n     have to be abridged—your \"_worthy friend_\" and other\r\n     humbugs may be left out to advantage. I am not at all\r\n     surprised at your success at getting subscribers; but\r\n     let me say, _cities_ are not the only places to obtain\r\n     them. Birds sing and nestle among the groves of the\r\n     _country_—The planters and farmers are the men to become\r\n     subscribers. An intelligent planter from the up country\r\n     said, a few days ago, that if the right person would\r\n     thoroughly canvass the whole State of South Carolina,\r\n     he would insure three hundred subscribers to the \"Small\r\n     Work.\" _Old Jostle_ would be the man, and when his legs\r\n     failed, the _Young Jostle_ should go forward. Get the\r\n     Editors to notice your work—this is a puffing world—from\r\n     the porpoise to the steamboat.\r\n\r\n     When we meet, we shall talk about the partnership in\r\n     the quadrupeds. I am willing to have my name stand\r\n     with yours, if it will help the sale of the book. The\r\n     expenses and the profits shall be yours or the boys'.\r\n     I am anxious to do something for the benefit of Victor\r\n     and John, in addition to the _treasures_ I have given\r\n     them—and this is all I can do.... Employ yourself now\r\n     in drawing every quadruped you can lay your hands upon.\r\n     If you can find me a live Ermine, buy it in New York. I\r\n     must once more examine and study its change of _pilage_.\r\n\r\n     Don't flatter yourself that the quadrupeds will be\r\n     child's play. I have studied them all my life. We have\r\n     much, both in Europe and America, to learn on this\r\n     subject. The skulls and the teeth must be studied, and\r\n     color is as variable as the wind; down, down in the\r\n     earth they grovel, while we, in digging and studying,\r\n     may grow old and cross. Our work must be thorough. I\r\n     would as soon stick my name to a _forged Bank Note_ as\r\n     to a mess of _soupmaigre_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: VICTOR GIFFORD AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    Published by courtesy of Charles Scribner's Sons.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JOHN WOODHOUSE AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    Published by courtesy Of Dr. R. W. Shufeldt.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Prospectus\" of Audubon's \"miniature\" edition of the Birds was as\r\nfollows:[174]\r\n\r\n     To those who have not seen any portion of Mr. Audubon's\r\n     Original Drawings, it may be proper to state, that their\r\n     superiority consists in the accuracy as to proportion\r\n     and outline, and the variety and truth of the attitudes\r\n     and positions of the figures, resulting from peculiar\r\n     means discovered and employed by him, and his attentive\r\n     examination of the objects portrayed, during a long\r\n     series of years. Mr. Audubon has not contented himself\r\n     with single profile views, but in many instances has\r\n     grouped his figures, so as to represent the originals\r\n     in their natural avocations, and has placed them on\r\n     branches of trees decorated with foliage, blossoms and\r\n     fruits, or amidst plants of numerous species—some are\r\n     seen pursuing their prey in the air, searching for food\r\n     amongst the leaves and herbage, sitting on their nests,\r\n     or feeding their young; whilst others, of a different\r\n     nature, swim, wade, or glide in or over their allotted\r\n     element. The insects, reptiles and fishes that form\r\n     the food of some of the birds, have now and then been\r\n     introduced in the drawings. In nearly every instance\r\n     where a difference of plumage exists between the\r\n     sexes, both male and female have been represented, and\r\n     the extraordinary changes which some species undergo\r\n     in their progress from youth to maturity, have been\r\n     depicted.\r\n\r\n     The plants are all copied from nature, and as many are\r\n     remarkable for their beauty, their usefulness, or their\r\n     rarity, the Botanist cannot fail to look upon them with\r\n     delight.\r\n\r\n     The particulars of the plan of the work can be reduced\r\n     to the following heads:\r\n\r\n     1. The size of the work is royal octavo, the paper being\r\n     of the finest quality.\r\n\r\n     2. The Plates representing the Birds are correctly\r\n     reduced from the original drawings, and are coloured in\r\n     the most careful manner.\r\n\r\n     3. The work will appear in numbers, on the first and\r\n     fifteenth of every month.\r\n\r\n     4. Each number will consist of Five Plates, accompanied\r\n     with full descriptions of the habits and localities of\r\n     the birds, their anatomy and digestive organs, (with\r\n     occasionally wood cuts representing the latter,) and\r\n     will be furnished to subscribers for one dollar, payable\r\n     on delivery.\r\n\r\n     5. The work will be published in accordance with a\r\n     scientific arrangement of the genera and species, and\r\n     will complete the Ornithology of our country, it is\r\n     believed, in the most perfect manner.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:     TITLE PAGE OF PAPER COVERS IN WHICH PARTS\r\n   OF THE FIRST AMERICAN (OCTAVO) EDITION OF \"THE BIRDS OF AMERICA\"\r\n   WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED.]\r\n\r\nThe octavo edition of Audubon's _Birds_ began to appear, in parts,\r\nlate in 1839, and was in press four years. It was illustrated with 500\r\nlithographic plates, which were reduced by John Woodhouse Audubon from\r\nhis father's old or new originals, with such changes as the breaking\r\nup of composite plates and other considerations rendered necessary.\r\nMany new flowers and trees made their appearance in these plates, and\r\nseventeen new birds were added to the last volume; the text was also\r\ngreatly improved by the process of addition and subtraction, as well\r\nas by the correction of many errors which it was then possible to\r\neffect: as twelve species were noticed without figures, this brought\r\nthe total number of American birds finally recognized by Audubon\r\nto 507.[175] The first considerable list of American birds with any\r\npretense to accuracy appeared in _Notes on Virginia_, published in\r\n1782, by Thomas Jefferson, who then named 109 species peculiar to\r\nthe United States; William Bartram, in 1791, gave 191; Alexander\r\nWilson, 278; Wilson and Ord, in 1808-14, 320, and Charles Bonaparte,\r\nin 1825-33, is said to have extended the number to 382. The present\r\nnumber of North American birds, omitting sub-species, admitted to the\r\nthird revised edition of the \"Check-List,\" prepared by a Committee of\r\nthe American Ornithologists' Union and published in New York in 1910,\r\nis 768. To this is added a hypothetical list of 26 names, the validity\r\nof which is still in doubt; these embrace Townsend's Bunting—_Spiza\r\ntownsendi_ (Audubon); Carbonated Warbler—_Dendroica carbonata_\r\n(Audubon), Blue Mountain Warbler—_Dendroica montana_ (Wilson), known\r\nonly in the works of Wilson and Audubon; the mysterious Small-headed\r\n\"Flycatcher,\" or Warbler—_Musicapa minuta_ (Wilson) or _Wilsonia_ (?)\r\n_microcephala_ (Ridgway), an account of which is given in Chapter XIV\r\nand which is known only in Wilson's and Audubon's works; and Cuvier's\r\nRegulus—_Regulus cuvieri_ (Audubon), which has never been seen beyond\r\nthe covers of _The Birds of America_, and its descriptive text: \"I\r\nshot _this_ bird,\" said Audubon, \"on my father-in-law's plantation of\r\nFatland Ford, on the Skuylkill River in Pennsylvania, on the 8th June\r\n1812, while on a visit to my honoured relative Mr. William Bakewell....\r\nI have not seen another since.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon was soon canvassing the principal cities for this work, with\r\nwhat success is shown by the following letter[176] to his family:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to his Family_\r\n\r\n          BALTIMORE, _Feb. 21. 1840_.\r\n          11 o'clock at night.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIENDS\r\n\r\n     So far so good, but alas! I am now out of numbers to\r\n     deliver to my subscribers here. Here! where I expected\r\n     to procure a good number more. This list is composed\r\n     of excellent men and all good pay. I have in my pocket\r\n     upwards of one hundred names, whom I am assured are\r\n     likely to subscribe. Therefor I will not leave Baltimore\r\n     for some days to come at least. I forward a copy of this\r\n     list to Chevalier by the same mail and yet you may as\r\n     well inquire if he has received it. More numbers I must\r\n     have as soon as possible as all my subscribers here are\r\n     anxious about receiving their copies, unfortunately I\r\n     had only 90 No. 2. I look upon this list as a capital\r\n     list. I have sent Mr. Ridgley of Annapolis a No. 1 and a\r\n     prospectus, and expect some names tomorrow evening from\r\n     that quarter.\r\n\r\n     I will remit money to Phila. and let you know how much\r\n     as soon as I can. The box has arrived here safely and\r\n     tomorrow or Monday I will deliver Biographies &c. D.\r\n     Potter is very ill and poor and yet I hope to get his\r\n     note before I leave here.\r\n\r\n     I received a note from dear Jonny dated at Norfolk, all\r\n     well and going on. I expect they are at this moment at\r\n     John Bachman's. I am fatigued beyond description and had\r\n     the misfortune last evening of skinning my shin bones,\r\n     they bled profusely however, and I hope will soon get\r\n     well, though feel rather sore at this very moment, but\r\n     I will take care of them.\r\n\r\n     The amount of attention which I have received here is\r\n     quite bewildering, the very streets resound with my\r\n     name, and I feel quite alarmed and queer as I trudge\r\n     along. Mess. _Meckle_, _Oldfield_ and the Brune family\r\n     have all assisted me in the most kind and brotherly\r\n     manner, indeed I may say that my success is mostly\r\n     derived from these excellent persons.\r\n\r\n     I have written to Mr. Mifflins. I feel that Theodore\r\n     Anderson will not live long. Mr. Morris has not yet\r\n     returned from Annapolis. See that the _notice_ in the\r\n     Baltimore Patriot which I sent you yesterday is inserted\r\n     in the _Albion_, the _New York Gazette_ and if possible\r\n     in the _Courrier_ and _Enquirer_.\r\n\r\n     I have sent one to Chevalier and another to Dr. Parkman.\r\n     I ought to have at this moment 300 copies Nos. 1, 2,\r\n     3, 4, for Washington City and really I think it would\r\n     be better to stop the publication of the work for _one\r\n     month_ to effect this. Therefor loose no time in urging\r\n     Mr. Bowen (write to him) and Chevalier also on this all\r\n     important subject.\r\n\r\n     If ever I was in want of assistance it is at this\r\n     moment and _you_ my dear Victor must be on the alert and\r\n     second my endeavors to render you all Happy! I would be\r\n     delighted to have a few lines from Mamma and Eliza at\r\n     the end of your next letter, which I hope to receive in\r\n     immediate answer to this, _Here_. I have marked all your\r\n     items in your last letter. Call from time to time at\r\n     the Mercantile Library. I am glad you have remitted to\r\n     the Rathbone's. Do write to Mr. Hoppenstall and see the\r\n     daughter of Capt. Brittan. I was invited last evening to\r\n     a great ball, and should have gone had not my accident\r\n     of shin bones prevented me. I am told that I would have\r\n     had some 20 names there.\r\n\r\n     Recollect that our agents name is Gideon B. Smith and\r\n     a most worthy man he is, highly recommended by Robert\r\n     Gilmor and others.\r\n\r\n          [No signature]\r\n\r\nTo the gratification of Audubon and his friends, the octavo edition\r\nof his _Birds of America_ was an immediate and great success. Only 300\r\ncopies of the plates of the first number, which was ready on December\r\n3, 1839, were printed, but in little more than a month 300 more were\r\ndemanded, and the number of plates required rose steadily until January\r\n9, 1841, when it stood at 1,475 copies.[177] The total number of\r\nsubscribers given in Audubon's published lists was 1,198, of which 198\r\nare credited to Boston, 164 to Baltimore, 141 to New York, sixty-five\r\nto Philadelphia, and forty-three to foreign countries, ten of which\r\nwent to England; Mr. George Oates of Charleston subscribed for seven\r\ncopies. Such a reception for an expensive work on natural history was\r\nunprecedented in the United States, and has had few parallels in any\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of this new undertaking, the hand of disease and\r\nbereavement rested heavily on the Audubon and Bachman families; they\r\nwere obliged to see first one and then another of their daughters swept\r\nby the same terrible malady, tuberculosis, to an early grave. Mrs. John\r\nWoodhouse Audubon died at her old home in Charleston, whither she had\r\ngone for the benefit of her health in the previous winter, on September\r\n23, 1840, at the age of twenty-three; and Mrs. Victor Audubon, after\r\na long sojourn in Cuba, and shortly after returning to her home in New\r\nYork, died there on May 25, 1841, at the age of twenty-two. Audubon was\r\nvery fond of his daughters-in-law, and his \"beloved Rosy,\" as Victor's\r\nwife was familiarly called, is said to have been a particular favorite\r\nand the life of his family circle. If work at this time brought no\r\npleasure, it at least afforded him relief from painful thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1840, a boy who lived in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, mustered\r\nup courage to write to the naturalist and give him an account of a\r\nnew bird, the Yellow-bellied Flycatcher, which he and his brother had\r\ndiscovered, under the very noses, as it were, of all the ornithologists\r\nin America. With that fine sense of modesty which characterized the man\r\nin after life, for his name was Spencer Fullerton Baird, he wrote:[178]\r\n\"You see Sir that I have taken (after much hesitation) the liberty of\r\nwriting you. I am but a boy, and very inexperienced, as you no doubt\r\nwill observe from my description of the Flycatcher.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon, who had just returned from the sick-bed of his\r\ndaughter-in-law, replied promptly as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK, _June 13, 1840_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     On my return home from Charleston S. C. yesterday, I\r\n     found your kind favor of the 4th inst. in which you\r\n     have the goodness to inform me that you have discovered\r\n     a new species of fly-catcher, and which, if the bird\r\n     corresponds to your description, is, indeed, likely\r\n     to prove itself hitherto undescribed, for although you\r\n     speak of yourself as being a youth, your style and the\r\n     descriptions you have sent me prove that an old head may\r\n     from time to time be found on young shoulders!\r\n\r\n     I wish you would send me one of the stuffed specimens as\r\n     well as the one preserved in spirits, and wish you also\r\n     to rest assured that if the little _Muscicapa_ stands as\r\n     a nondescript that I shall feel pleased to name it after\r\n     your friend.\r\n\r\n     I have never seen a male of the Cape May warbler with\r\n     the upper part of the head pure black. Have you compared\r\n     the _Regulus_ with the description of _Regulus Cuvieri_?\r\n     Could you not send me your bird to look at? Being on the\r\n     eve of publishing the Quadrupeds of our Country, I have\r\n     thought that you might have it in your power to procure\r\n     several of the smaller species for me, and thereby\r\n     assist me considerably. Please write to me again soon,\r\n     as I must resume my travels in 8 or 10 days. Have you\r\n     seen a copy of the small edition of The Birds of America\r\n     which I am now publishing? Believe me, dear sir,\r\n\r\n          With good wishes, your obt. sert.,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON\r\n\r\nThus began a correspondence between the youth of fifteen and the\r\nveteran of fifty-five, which led to an intimate friendship that lasted\r\nduring Audubon's active career, and was an undoubted stimulus to young\r\nBaird, whose talents, enthusiasm and industry were quickly appreciated\r\nby the older naturalist. Baird answered Audubon's letter on June 20,\r\nand proffered his services in collecting mammals, saying that while\r\nthey were more difficult to find than birds, he hoped \"by increased\r\nexertion to make up the difference\"; he also added: \"I have seen some\r\nnumbers of your work now publishing, and admire them very much. I have\r\nno doubt that it will do more to spread a love of Natural history,\r\nthan any work ever published. For my part I read the description of\r\nbirds and the episodes in your _Ornithological Biography_ with the same\r\nmotive of pleasure as I used to read a favorite novel.\" In Audubon's\r\nimmediate reply of the 22nd, he said:\r\n\r\n     It is impossible at present for me to give you any\r\n     precise idea of the work on our quadrupeds which I have\r\n     in contemplation to publish, any further than to say\r\n     to you, that it is my intention, as well as that of my\r\n     friend, the Revd John Bachman, of Charleston, S. C.,\r\n     assisted by several others of our best naturalists,\r\n     to issue a work on the Mammalia of North America\r\n     worthy of the naturalist's attention, both at home\r\n     and abroad.—Through our joint efforts, and assisted\r\n     as we hope and trust to be, by numerous friends and\r\n     acquaintances in different portions of our Wide Union,\r\n     we expect to collect, not only new species, but much of\r\n     valuable matter connected with their geographical range,\r\n     and particular habits. For instance, in your assistance\r\n     in this department as well as in ornithology, you may\r\n     be able to send us valuable intelligence respecting\r\n     the Shrews, Mice, Rats, Squirrels, etc., found in your\r\n     immediate vicinity &c.—and by saving and forwarding\r\n     specimens to us, be able also, in all probability, to\r\n     place into our hands, objects never before known to the\r\n     World of Science. Whatever information we thus receive\r\n     is sacredly published under the name of the friend\r\n     from whom we receive the information, etc. I have sent\r\n     you the Zoological report of Docr. De Kay. His _Corvus\r\n     cocolotle_ [cacolotl] is really our Raven. _Supposed_ by\r\n     some inexperienced European naturalists to be distinct\r\n     from the Raven of Europe, which, however, is a gross\r\n     error.[179]...\r\n\r\n     The thrush which you have described, and which you\r\n     kindly offer to send me, may be new, but perhaps you\r\n     are not acquainted with the Turdus Nanus of my work,\r\n     to which it appears, if not the same, probably a new\r\n     variety! _Nous verrons_....\r\n\r\n     Please to collect all the Shrews, Mice, (field or wood),\r\n     rats, bats, Squirrels, etc., and put them in a jar in\r\n     common Rum, not whiskey, brandy or alcohol. All of the\r\n     latter spirits are sure to injure the subjects.\r\n\r\nAudubon, who was now \"killing two birds with one stone\"—collecting\r\nsubscribers for one work and mammals for another, had found a strong\r\nand willing helper in the young naturalist of Carlisle. On December 10\r\nof the same year Baird wrote that he had discovered another Flycatcher,\r\nas well as a small Woodpecker, which was apparently new, and had shot a\r\n\"Bay Lynx or Wild Cat a mile & a quarter from Carlisle; the cat ... was\r\n2½ feet long & weighed 12½ pounds.... It was a source of great regret,\"\r\nsaid Baird, \"that I was not able to meet you in Philadelphia when I was\r\nthere during the latter part of September. I saw Mr. Chevalier[180]\r\nseveral times, and found him a very agreeable gentleman.\" Audubon\r\nreplied to this letter on Christmas Day, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK, _December 25, 1840_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     On my return yesterday from a tour of a month, I found\r\n     your kind favor of the 10th inst. at my house. I regret\r\n     exceedingly that you and I should not have met at\r\n     Philadelphia, as I feel sure by the style and contents\r\n     of your letters to me that you are fond of the study of\r\n     natural objects, as much as I am.\r\n\r\n     I have no doubt that your journey during the last\r\n     summer and autumn was a pleasing one to you, as I can\r\n     well conceive from the fresh recollections of my many\r\n     rambles.\r\n\r\n     You would oblige me much by sending me (through Mr.\r\n     Chevelier) the _Muscicapa_ you obtained Oct. 12th, and\r\n     also the small woodpecker \"with the very broad bill\".\r\n     I am anxious to see those birds, and will take especial\r\n     care of them, and also return them to you, free of all\r\n     expense.\r\n\r\n     I cannot at this moment return to the specimens you have\r\n     already sent me, but in my next letter, I will assure\r\n     you of the names of the subjects. I wish I could see\r\n     your Bay Lynx, as I feel somewhat confident that we have\r\n     more than two species within our limits.\r\n\r\n     Your anecdote connected with the sagacity of the\r\n     Weasel is quite pleasing to me, and will appear in my\r\n     biographies of quadrupeds bye and bye. I cannot, as yet,\r\n     give you any estimate of my work on the Quadrupeds of\r\n     our Country but will do so as soon as possible. With my\r\n     best wishes, for your health and prosperity, I pray you\r\n     to consider me as your friend and obt. servant,\r\n\r\n     JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nIn the following letter by William Yarrell,[181] English naturalist and\r\nsportsman, are interesting references to Audubon's smaller edition of\r\n_The Birds of America_ as well as to the writer's _History of British\r\nBirds_, which later became the standard work on the ornithology of\r\nGreat Britain:\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Yarrell to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          [Addressed] J.

The Prince of Musignano now P. of Canino\r\n     I hear of by report from others—He is quite well,\r\n     continually publishing, and we hear that he means to\r\n     visit London in the course of the present year—of Mr.\r\n     Lear we hear the most satisfactory accounts—generally\r\n     through Mr. Hullmandill—he is greatly improved in health\r\n     and finances—a favorite with every body, patronized by\r\n     all who go there—and he too, we hear, means to visit\r\n     England in the course of the present year. Mr. Gould\r\n     returned safe to England in August last, after an\r\n     absence of two years and 8 months—Two years of the time\r\n     were passed on Van Diemans land and various parts of New\r\n     Holland—he did not go to New Zealand—He has brought home\r\n     a very large collection of Birds, with, in many cases,\r\n     the eggs and nests—He has commenced the publication of\r\n     the Birds on the same scale as his Birds of Europe, but\r\n     improved in execution—two parts are out: it is to be\r\n     published every three months.

AUDUBON Esqr\r\n          New York—\r\n\r\nSpencer Baird and his brother, William, were soon able to announce\r\nanother discovery, now well known the country over as the Least\r\nFlycatcher, and in some sections by the onomatopœic name of Chebec. In\r\nreferring to it in his letter of June 21, 1841, Baird wrote:\r\n\r\n     There is one flycatcher respecting which we are in\r\n     doubt, and which was very abundant this spring. It is\r\n     the one we had considered _M. Pusilla_ but a thorough\r\n     examination of the Biography, has thrown doubt on this\r\n     supposition, it agrees pretty well with the _M. Acadica_\r\n     of Nuttall, but not with the _Acadica_, of the Synopsis.\r\n     I will send you one as soon as possible, as there is no\r\n     set of Plates in Carlisle to which we might refer.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Baird added: \"May we not expect to see you in Carlisle\r\nbefore a great while? It would give us very great pleasure indeed.\"\r\n\r\nThough Audubon gladly admitted this new-found species of bird at a\r\nlater day, he was not at first disposed to accept its validity, as will\r\nappear in the following interesting letter which he sent to his young\r\nfriend:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK, _July 29, 1841_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR,—\r\n\r\n     I have not had time to answer your interesting favor\r\n     of the 21st until this morning, being now constantly\r\n     engaged in the figuring, &c., of the Quadrupeds of\r\n     Our Country; by which I mean that I actually work from\r\n     daylight every day until I retire to my necessary repose\r\n     at night.\r\n\r\n     Your observations upon the birds of passage the last\r\n     spring are what they have been almost throughout the U.\r\n     S. The very backward spring which we have experienced\r\n     this year did no doubt retard the coming into the States\r\n     the millions of passenger birds that come to us from\r\n     beyond our limits. The Fly-catcher of which you are in\r\n     doubt is nevertheless the _M. Pusilla_, and you must not\r\n     be surprised to find _perhaps_ some discrepancy between\r\n     the specimens you have procured and the descriptions you\r\n     may have read, as among mine these differences are quite\r\n     obvious and belonging to either sex or age, as is indeed\r\n     the case with most of our birds as well as among many of\r\n     our quadrupeds....\r\n\r\n     I cannot at present tell you when I may have the\r\n     pleasure of meeting you at your own domicile, and yet\r\n     this may happen quite unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n     Do you pay attention to the quadrupeds around you? If\r\n     not, I wish you would!—and moreover I should be highly\r\n     pleased to hear of your procuring for us all such as may\r\n     be found in your vicinity. You have _Bats, Wood Rats,\r\n     & Mice, Weasels, &c., &c._, all of which I should like\r\n     to possess specimens at your hands. Could you not save\r\n     all that you come across with in this way, place them\r\n     in _common good Rum_, and forward them to me at once or\r\n     as soon as you have some 2 or three species. I will most\r\n     cheerfully pay all expenses to Philadelphia addressed to\r\n     _J. B. Chevalier_, No. 70 Dock Street.\r\n\r\n     I am now as anxious about the publication of the\r\n     Quadrupeds as I ever was in the procuring of our Birds,\r\n     indeed my present interest in Zoology is altogether\r\n     bent toward the Completion of this department of Natural\r\n     Science.\r\n\r\n     Do please write to me often as I am always glad to hear\r\n     from you, and when I am somewhat slow in answering your\r\n     letters, be assured that it is altogether on a/c of the\r\n     excess of Labour that I have to go through.\r\n\r\n          Believe me with sincere good wishes\r\n          Your friend and servant,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J.

PUBLISHED BY COURTESY OF THE AMERICAN\r\n    MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Audubon never went to Carlisle, young Baird, as we shall\r\nsee, repeatedly visited him in New York and became a favorite with his\r\nfamily. A description of the new Flycatchers was published by the Baird\r\nbrothers in 1843, and represented Spencer's first contribution to his\r\nfavorite science; Audubon included their discovery in the Appendix to\r\nthe seventh and last volume of _The Birds of America_ in 1844.\r\n\r\nAudubon's occupations in the summer of this year are clearly reflected\r\nin the following letter:[182]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Dr. George Parkman_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK, _June 20th 1841_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND.—\r\n\r\n     I intended having written to you yesterday by Miss\r\n     Shatuck, who was good enough to spend the day with\r\n     us, but I was so deeply engaged on a drawing of\r\n     Rocky Mountain Flying Squirrels, that the time of her\r\n     departure came suddenly and I could merely ask of her\r\n     to say to you, that your last letter and remittance had\r\n     reached us in safety, and with the unexampled promptness\r\n     shewn by you on the three occasions you have been\r\n     troubled with the delivery of 46 parts of our work to 46\r\n     of our Boston subscribers; and for which as I have said\r\n     before I am very sorry to have nought but our sincerest\r\n     thanks and gratitude to you for this, so remarkable,\r\n     proceeding. May God reward you and yours for all your\r\n     generous actions.\r\n\r\n     I thank you also for your memorandums about the\r\n     quadrupeds in the Boston Museum as I see that our animal\r\n     there may save me the trouble of going to the State of\r\n     Maine for it. When I was last under the hospitable roof\r\n     of our Friend Docr Shattuck, I saw in George's room a\r\n     No. of the \"Penny Magazine\" in which there is a plate\r\n     representing a family of Beavers at work, that reminded\r\n     me greatly of what I have seen in the ponds of Indiana\r\n     some thirty years ago, and which I should like to have\r\n     for a few days to assist in part in the making of the\r\n     background to my Drawing of these animals, drawn from\r\n     the Individual you procured for me. I will take good\r\n     care of the No. and will return it safely very soon.\r\n\r\n     Should George Shattuck have forwarded that No. to Mr. B.\r\n     of Baltimore, pray ask him to write to the later to send\r\n     it to me as soon as convenient. If per chance you could\r\n     procure for me a live _Hare in the Summer dress_ (It\r\n     is pure white in winter) pray do so and do not mind the\r\n     price or the cost of its conveyance to me. This animal\r\n     is abundant in the northern portions of your State and\r\n     is fully double the size of the common _Hare_ called the\r\n     \"Rabbit.\"\r\n\r\n     With sincerest regards and kindest remembrances to all\r\n     around you and our mutual Friends,\r\n\r\n          believe [me] yours always\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n          The \"Parkman Wren\"\r\n          well mounted will soon be\r\n          on your chimney mantle!\r\n\r\nThe unique specimen of the little Wren, referred to in the postscript\r\nof this letter, had been discovered on the Columbia River by Dr.\r\nTownsend some years before, and though Audubon had described it in\r\n1839, his figure of it had but just appeared; this was doubtless\r\nincluded, as Mr. Thayer remarks, in the parts of the octavo edition of\r\n_The Birds of America_, which Dr. Parkman distributed at Boston in the\r\nsummer of this year.\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the zeal and energy with which Audubon undertook\r\nhis work on the quadrupeds, the following letter (dated \"New York,\r\nAugust 15, 1841,\" and addressed to \"W. O. Ayres,[183] Esq., Miller's\r\nPlace, Suffolk county, Long Island, New York\") will be read with\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to W. O. Ayres_\r\n\r\n     I am now closely engaged in conjunction with my friend\r\n     the Revd. John Bachman—of Charleston, S. C., in the\r\n     preparing of a work on the viviparous quadrupeds of\r\n     North America, and I have already drawn about one\r\n     hundred figures of these, including thirty-six species.\r\n\r\n     Now knowing the interest you feel towards the\r\n     advancement of Natural Science, in every department, I\r\n     have thought that should you assist us in the procuring\r\n     specimens, whether in the flesh or skin, dead or alive;\r\n     that we would be much benefitted by such aid.—Long\r\n     Island possesses rare and valuable species, and although\r\n     many of them are plentiful they are rarely procured\r\n     unless accidentally as it were. In your Rambles after\r\n     the feathered Tribe, you surely come across at times\r\n     with quadrupeds, and if you were good enough to shoot\r\n     them or to catch them and send them to me in the manner\r\n     mentioned below, I personally would feel extremely\r\n     obliged to you.\r\n\r\n     Bats, Wood Rats and Wood Mice, Shrews, Shrew Moles and\r\n     all the smaller animals can be forwarded in an earthern\r\n     jar immersed in good Yankee Rum.—The larger kinds can\r\n     be skinned, preserving the skull entire, and also the\r\n     legbone and the clavicles. One fore & one hind foot\r\n     ought to be pinned on a board or cork until perfectly\r\n     dried, and actual measurements and weights forwarded\r\n     with the specimens. Nos. accordingly with the notes of\r\n     localities and dates. Young and old are wanted. The Cat\r\n     Squirrel is now and then procured about you of a very\r\n     large size—the Woodchuck &c. but it is unnecessary for\r\n     me to give you a list as we are anxious to procure every\r\n     thing we can from every portion of the Union with the\r\n     view to ascertain their geographical range.\r\n\r\nThe expense involved in producing the early numbers of the small\r\nedition of his _Birds_ must have been great, and Audubon was feeling\r\nthe strain, when the letter,[184] dated \"New York—April 29, 1841,\" from\r\nwhich the following extract is taken, was sent to his Boston agent:\r\n\"I doubt much if you are _actually aware_ that we have at this moment\r\nin this city and at Philadelphia upwards of _Seventy_ persons employed\r\nupon the present work, and that all these ... are to be paid regularly\r\neach Saturday evening, and that _when we are out of temper_ it is not\r\nwithout cause.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Baird visited the Audubons, in New York, in January, 1842, he was\r\nfascinated by the masterly drawings of birds and quadrupeds which were\r\nthen being produced, and was determined to pay more attention himself\r\nto an art for which presumably he had little natural aptitude; he seems\r\nalso to have received a hint for the improvement of his somewhat loose\r\nchirography. Upon leaving, Audubon presented his pupil with a copy of\r\nthe _Biography_ of Birds. After returning to his home, Baird wrote from\r\nCarlisle, on February 8 of that year:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spencer Fullerton Baird to Audubon_\r\n\r\n     After a trial of two weeks I begin to find that I am\r\n     getting over the shock caused by the sudden transition\r\n     from the bustle of Broadway to the lifelessness of\r\n     Carlisle, and hope that by the application of the proper\r\n     means I may in time perfectly recover. Philadelphia\r\n     seemed dull but Carlisle was death itself. My visit now\r\n     however seems but as a dream, and I have settled down\r\n     into my old regular monotonous life as if I had never\r\n     been absent a day. When I arrived my friends had a great\r\n     many questions to ask of course, but almost the first\r\n     ones on every lip were about Mr. Audubon,—how he looked?\r\n     What was his age, whether the idea they had formed of\r\n     him from his writings was correct, many queries also\r\n     were respecting Mrs. A. and her sons; and they all\r\n     said that they would be ever grateful to them for their\r\n     kindness, to one away from home....\r\n\r\n     For want of other objects I have commenced to draw the\r\n     sternal and shoulder apparatus of our birds, a pretty\r\n     large collection of which I have been making for a year\r\n     past.... Have you heard from Mr. Lyon of Bedford yet\r\n     about the money he owes you? I was asking about him the\r\n     other day, of an acquaintance of his, who told me that\r\n     he was as good as gold in all his debts, & expressed\r\n     some surprise at his not having paid, as he generaly is\r\n     very punctual.... Last week I walked up to Pinegrove an\r\n     iron works about sixteen miles in the mountains where\r\n     resides the Mr. Ege I have so often spoken about as\r\n     the mighty Nimrod of our county. On my arrival I found\r\n     a fine wild cat hanging in the stable which had been\r\n     killed a few days before. On returning the next day I\r\n     took the cat with me slung across my shoulders, and on\r\n     reaching home after measuring & weighing it skinned it.\r\n     I am in hopes of getting some more from here, as they\r\n     promised to catch all they could for me.\r\n\r\nBaird signed himself \"Your affectionate pupil,\" and added in a\r\npostscript: \"I forgot to say that I had a fine steak of the wild\r\ncat broiled and it tasted like a tender piece of fresh pork. I will\r\ncertainly eat the whole of the next one obtained. I intend to taste all\r\nthe Quadrupeds inhabiting this part of the country.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon's interesting reply was in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK, _Feby. 10, 1842_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND.\r\n\r\n     It is about half an hour since I had the real pleasure\r\n     of receiving your letter of the 8th inst. and my earnest\r\n     thanks to you for it and its contents; to all of which\r\n     I will try to answer at your request.\r\n\r\n     That beautiful Carlisle, its surrounding hills bordering\r\n     its valleys, all within the bosom of quiet nature should\r\n     appear to you as a small affair when compared to our\r\n     largest city in the Union, is not at all remarkable,\r\n     but let me ask you the following questions. Did you\r\n     meet all your dear Parents and Friends quite well? Did\r\n     they not receive you with the kindest of welcomes? Were\r\n     not their _hearts_ and feelings towards you the same as\r\n     ever? Surely all this was fact, and being so, would you\r\n     not after all prefer _Little Carlisle_ than _Great New\r\n     York_ with all its humbug, rascality, and immorality?\r\n     Surely or do I mistake your nature sadly, you do! It\r\n     is now a good long time since I was young, and resided\r\n     near Norristown in Pennsylvania. It was then and is now\r\n     a very indifferent place as compared with New York;\r\n     but still my heart and mind oftentime dwell in the\r\n     pleasure that I felt there, and it always reminds me\r\n     that within a few miles of that village, my Mother[185]\r\n     did live, and it was there also that my good fortune\r\n     led me to know and to marry the excellent Wife I have\r\n     yet, at whose hands yourself have tried to be rendered\r\n     comfortable. Say what you will. \"there is nothing like\r\n     home\"... I wish I could be with you, if only for one\r\n     week, for then I imagine that between your friends of\r\n     the mountains, yourself, and myself, we could Tree a\r\n     \"Catamount\" and soon untree him. The tugging part of\r\n     that far-famed animal, I would cheerfully give up to\r\n     your youthful shoulders, but not so with the figuring of\r\n     it, yet for a while. Is there such a Beast in existence?\r\n     Do let me know as soon as you can. I am heartily glad\r\n     that you have procured a wild cat from the mountainous\r\n     part of Pennsylvania, and that you have preserved its\r\n     skin, which I beg you to forward as soon as you please,\r\n     along with whatever other quadrupeds you may have\r\n     in hand, that we may say more on those Beasts of the\r\n     Central States, than has ever been before told....\r\n\r\n     _Look out for Martens_, and try to find me some youself!\r\n     I am glad that you find wild cat meat pretty good, as it\r\n     corroborates the sayings of many others, who pronounce\r\n     it equal to young veal.\r\n\r\n     Let me say to you (\"en passant\") that your handwriting\r\n     is considerably improved, and depend upon it that\r\n     your attention _to Drawing_ will soon enable you as of\r\n     \"copper plate.\" Go ahead!\r\n\r\n     I now wish you earnestly to offer our joint respects,\r\n     regards, and best wishes to all your family and friends,\r\n     and to believe me always,\r\n\r\n          Yours most truly,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n          86 White Street.\r\n\r\n     P. S. Thank you for what you say of the Bedford\r\n     gentleman. When I write next, I will mention him at\r\n     greater length. I wish you could let me know whether we\r\n     could procure first rate peach trees from your vicinity,\r\n     and how much 50 of them would cost. I should like to\r\n     have them assorted, soft, and clings yellow, or red, or\r\n     blood-red. We wish to plant these as early in March as\r\n     possible, if young trees, two years old could be had,\r\n     we might, perhaps, have fruit on some of them during\r\n     the next summer? Try what you can do for your New York\r\n     friend. [The following on outside of letter-sheet] I\r\n     will make up a box for you in a few days, and send it to\r\n     you through Mr. Chevalier.\r\n\r\nAudubon, who ever found city life irksome, as early as 1841 had begun\r\nto look about for a farm, or some retired spot within easy access to\r\nNew York, where he could establish the families of himself, of his two\r\nsons, and have about him many of the animals which he then wished to\r\nstudy and depict for his new work. Edward Harris would have been glad\r\nto have had him for a neighbor, and wrote from Moorestown, New Jersey,\r\non July 5, 1841, suggesting that he examine \"a small farm close to\r\n_his_ village, containing about 25 acres of very good land,\" which\r\nthe owner was then willing to sell for $3,500, though, added Harris,\r\n\"when Mr. Havell was here, he asked $5,000 for it.\" A spot more to his\r\nliking, however, was found on the Hudson River, in Carmansville, later\r\nknown as Washington Heights, where he purchased from thirty to forty\r\nacres of land which had a river frontage of a thousand feet, from the\r\npresent One Hundred and Fifty-fifth to One Hundred and Fifty-eighth\r\nStreets, and extended to the easterly limits of the village at the old\r\nBloomingdale Road, near the present Amsterdam Avenue. This tract was\r\nwell wooded, and among the grand forest trees on the place a large\r\ntulip or white wood attracted general attention from its great girth\r\nand commanding height. Audubon decided to place his house at the\r\nfoot of the river bluff, amid a cluster of fine oaks, chestnuts and\r\nevergreens, and a clearing had to be made before the site could be laid\r\noff; it was some years before the railroad came to mar his river view\r\nand interrupt access to the beach. Audubon began to build in 1841, and\r\non February 24, 1842, Victor wrote to Edward Harris: \"Our house in the\r\ncountry is going on well, and will probably be ready for us in about\r\ntwo months. John is at work out there every day\"; they were planning,\r\nhe said, to raise pigs and poultry, and he inquired after \"draining\r\ntiles, such as are made near Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nAudubon named his new estate \"Minnie's Land,\" in honor of his wife,\r\nLucy, to whom he deeded the property, the Scotch form of her name\r\nhaving no doubt come into familiar use during their residence abroad.\r\nIn April, 1842, they turned their backs on the city and occupied their\r\nnew home. Spencer Baird, when writing on May 3 of that year, said:\r\n\r\n     I have been in some doubt where this letter should be\r\n     addressed, since \"86 White St.\" will not reach you, and\r\n     you must by this time be snugly fixed I hope in your\r\n     beautiful place up the River. Do not laugh therefore if\r\n     I prefix \"Formerly\" to the old superscription....\r\n\r\n     I suppose that the First Number of the \"Quadrupeds of\r\n     North America\" is out by this time, I hope that it will\r\n     be hailed by a large list of subscribers, and will do\r\n     what I can for this desirable end.\r\n\r\nSubmerged as Audubon was, with painting the _Quadrupeds_, keeping the\r\nsmall edition of his _Birds_ in motion, and canvassing for subscribers\r\nto both works, which he published himself, he nevertheless found\r\ntime for an extraordinary number of letters, which were written with\r\nan elegance of chirography that diverts our attention from their\r\northographic defects. In the labor of drawing and in all his business\r\naffairs he was constantly aided by his sons.\r\n\r\nIn Audubon's time the center of Carmansville was a quarter of a mile to\r\nthe east of his house, while at a short distance below, on the river,\r\nlay Manhattanville, at the present One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street,\r\nfrom which men frequently came on summer evenings to help handle the\r\nseine, fish then being plentiful in that part of the Hudson. The place\r\ncame to possess a good garden and orchard, with stable, dairy, and\r\npoultry yards; enclosures also were made for deer, elk, wolves, foxes\r\nand other wild animals. The old barn of the Audubon place stood higher\r\non the slope where the naturalist built his studio or painting house,\r\nbut no traces of either now exist. Though standing low, the house\r\ncommanded a wide sweep of the river with the Palisades on its opposite\r\nshore, and such attractive surroundings were a never failing source of\r\ndelight and inspiration to the naturalist to his dying day.\r\n\r\nIn describing Audubon's activities, Parke Godwin made this note in the\r\nspring of 1842:[186]\r\n\r\n     During the last winter, which he spent in this city, he\r\n     has worked on an average fourteen hours a day, preparing\r\n     a work on the Quadrupeds of America, similar to his work\r\n     on the Birds. The drawings already finished, of the size\r\n     of life, are master-pieces in their way, surpassing if\r\n     that be possible, in fidelity and brilliancy, all that\r\n     he has done before. Early in the summer he will depart\r\n     to continue his labors in the woods.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: \"MINNIE'S LAND\" AS IT APPEARED IN 1865.\r\n\r\n    After a lithograph published in D. T. Valentine's _Manual of the\r\n    Council of the City of New York_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: \"MINNIE'S LAND\" AS IT APPEARS TO-DAY FROM THE RIVER\r\n    FRONT, POCKETED BY THE RETAINING WALL OF RIVERSIDE DRIVE.]\r\n\r\nBefore we glance at the half-submerged relic of Audubon's old house as\r\nit stands today in upper New York,[187] we shall follow the same writer\r\nin a visit which he made to \"Minnie's Land\" in the summer of 1842 but\r\ndid not describe until eleven years later;[188] we will only add that\r\nat this time Audubon was in his fifty-eighth year, and not over sixty,\r\nas this writer surmised. After passing beyond the outposts of the city\r\nof that day, and turning into a rustic road which led directly to the\r\nriver, his walk\r\n\r\n     soon brought a secluded country house into view,—a house\r\n     not entirely adapted to the nature of the scenery,\r\n     yet simple and unpretending in its architecture, and\r\n     beautifully embowered amid elms and oaks. Several\r\n     graceful fawns and noble elk were stalking in the shade\r\n     of the trees, apparently unconscious of the presence of\r\n     a few dogs, and not caring for the numerous turkeys,\r\n     geese, and other domestic animals that gabbled and\r\n     screamed among them....\r\n\r\n     \"Is the master at home?\" I asked of the pretty\r\n     maid-servant who answered my tap at the door, and who\r\n     after informing me that he was, led me into a room on\r\n     the left side of the broad hall. It was not, however,\r\n     a parlor, or any ordinary reception-room that I\r\n     entered, but evidently a room for work. In one corner\r\n     stood a painter's easel, with a half-finished sketch\r\n     of a beaver on paper; in the other lay the skin of an\r\n     American panther. The antlers of elks hung upon the\r\n     walls, stuffed birds of every description of gay plumage\r\n     ornamented the mantle-piece; and exquisite drawings\r\n     of field-mice, orioles, and woodpeckers were scattered\r\n     promiscuously in other parts of the room, across one end\r\n     of which a long rude table was stretched to hold artist\r\n     materials, scraps of drawing paper and immense folio\r\n     volumes filled with the delicious paintings of birds\r\n     taken in their haunts.\r\n\r\nThe master, who soon appeared,\r\n\r\n     was a tall, thin man, with a high arched and serene\r\n     forehead, and a bright penetrating gray eye; his white\r\n     locks fell in clusters upon his shoulders, but were\r\n     the only signs of age, for his form was erect, and his\r\n     step as light as that of a deer. The expression of his\r\n     face was sharp, but noble and commanding, and there was\r\n     something in it, partly derived from the aquiline nose\r\n     and partly from the shutting of the mouth, which made\r\n     you think of the imperial eagle.\r\n\r\n     His greeting, as he entered, was at once frank and\r\n     cordial, and showed you the sincere and true man. \"How\r\n     kind it is,\" he said with a slight French accent, and\r\n     in a pensive tone, \"to come and see me; and how wise,\r\n     too, to leave that crazy city!\" He then shook me warmly\r\n     by the hand. \"Do you know,\" he continued, \"how I wonder\r\n     that men can consent to swelter and fret their lives\r\n     away amid those hot bricks and pestilent vapors, when\r\n     the woods and fields are all so near?\"\r\n\r\nWhen writing in 1845, Godwin gave further intimations of the\r\nnaturalist's appearance: \"His forehead [was] high, arched, and\r\nunclouded; the hairs of the brow prominent, particularly at the root\r\nof the nose, which was long and aquiline; chin prominent, and mouth\r\ncharacterized by energy and determination. The eyes were deep-gray, set\r\ndeeply in the head, and as restless as the glance of an eagle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION TO THE UPPER MISSOURI\r\n\r\n     Ambitions at fifty-seven—Plans his last expedition\r\n     in the _rôle_ of naturalist—Credentials from public\r\n     men—Canvassing tour in Canada described—Baird's plans\r\n     to accompany Audubon west frustrated—Western expedition\r\n     begun—Ascent of the Missouri and Yellowstone—Discoveries\r\n     of new birds—A wilderness that howls—Buffalo\r\n     hunting—Passing of the great herds—Return from Fort\r\n     Union—Incident on the canal boat—Completion of the\r\n     octavo edition of the _Birds_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1842, when his two new undertakings were well in hand,\r\nAudubon was planning a journey which he felt would help them both, his\r\nlong cherished but ever deferred expedition to the Far West; in the\r\ndim perspective his mind's eye could trace the snowy summits of the\r\nRocky Mountains, a promised land he was never destined to see, though,\r\nwith true poetic justice, one of those grand peaks now bears his name.\r\nAt this time he was in his fifty-eighth year, and although his family\r\nthought him too old for so arduous a journey, he would not be thwarted,\r\nfor his eye was undimmed and his natural force unabated.\r\n\r\nThe letters which passed between Audubon and Baird at this time show\r\nhow eager was his young friend to attach himself to the party. While in\r\nWashington, July 27, 1842, Baird wrote:\r\n\r\n     After making several unsuccessful efforts to get a\r\n     second sight of you day before yesterday, I was obliged\r\n     to give up the attempt in despair. I went to the\r\n     Capitol at half past twelve and wandered over the whole\r\n     building, Library, Senate Chamber and House, without\r\n     being able to see or hear anything of your excellency.\r\n     In the evening as in the morning I was again at Fuller's\r\n     without avail, went up the street, listened awhile to\r\n     the Circus music, came back, you were in bed.\r\n\r\n     One thing I wanted to ask you about, was respecting\r\n     your proposed trip next spring.... Nothing would\r\n     delight me more than to go, if I can afford it. Next\r\n     what preparation would I have to make to fit myself\r\n     to accompany you. The journey ought to be a sort of\r\n     \"Humboldt & Bonpland\" one, for the purpose of increasing\r\n     the general sum of knowledge in every department of\r\n     science, physical as well as natural.... If there is\r\n     anything I can do for you here, do not hesitate to\r\n     command me.\r\n\r\nAudubon's interesting reply to this letter will be given in full:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK, _July 30, 1842_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND,—\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the 27th Inst. reached me yesterday. I am\r\n     truly vexed that I should have missed you at the Library\r\n     or the Congress Chambers, where I went (perhaps too\r\n     late) between 3 and 4 o'clock of the afternoon, having\r\n     been detained at the different Departments of State\r\n     where it was my duty to call, preparatory to the next\r\n     coming Great Western Journey.\r\n\r\n     Now it proves by your letter that you feel favorably\r\n     disposed to accompany me on this long thought-of and\r\n     contemplated Tour, and wish me to give you some idea\r\n     of the expenses, attached to such an undertaking; but\r\n     to this question I am quite unable to reply at present,\r\n     although I may do so in a few weeks, and which I shall\r\n     do, provided you write to me again on the subject.\r\n\r\n     I have no very particular desire to embark as deep in\r\n     the Cause of Science as the great Humboldt has done,\r\n     and that, simply because I am too poor in pecuniary\r\n     means and too incompetent; but I wish nevertheless _to\r\n     attempt_ to open the Eyes of naturalists to _Riches\r\n     untold_, and _facts hitherto untold_. The portions of\r\n     the country through which it is my intention to pass,\r\n     never having been trodden by white Man previously.\r\n\r\n     I have some very strong doubts whether the results of\r\n     the Antarctic Expedition will be published for some time\r\n     yet; for, alas, our Government has not the means, at\r\n     present, of paying some _half a Million of Dollars_ to\r\n     produce publications such as they should publish, and\r\n     connected with the vast stores of Information, collected\r\n     by so many Scientific Men in no less than Four Years of\r\n     Constant Toil and privation, and which ought to come\r\n     to the World of Science at least as brightly as the\r\n     brightest rays of the Orb of Day during the Mid-summer\r\n     Solstice. Oh, my dear young friend, that I did possess\r\n     the wealth of the Emperor of Russia, or of the King of\r\n     the French; then, indeed, I would address the Congress\r\n     of our Country, ask of them to throw open these stores\r\n     of Natural Curiosities, and Comply with mine every wish\r\n     to publish, and to _Give away_ Copies of the invaluable\r\n     Works thus produced to every Scientific Institution\r\n     throughout our Country, and throughout the World.\r\n\r\n     As you however appear desirous to present my thoughts\r\n     of your capabilities as one of the assistants in that\r\n     Stupendous undertaking, I send you enclosed what I hope\r\n     most sincerely may prove beneficial for such purposes.\r\n\r\n     Now as you have been kind enough to offer me your\r\n     services at Washington, I ask you to call upon Mr.\r\n     Cushing, M. C., of Mass.tts, and to ask him to have the\r\n     goodness to forward me the Letter promised me by the\r\n     President of the U. S., for, as I have not yet had it,\r\n     I somewhat fear that it has been missent.\r\n\r\n          Write me at once, and believe me,\r\n\r\n          Your friend, JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nAudubon enclosed with this letter a warm recommendation of his friend\r\nfor the position of curator of the rich collections made by the\r\nUnited States Exploring Expedition to the Antarctic, under command\r\nof Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, then stored at the Patent Office\r\nand National Institute, but nothing came of it and Baird went away\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, in accordance with his usual custom, Audubon had\r\ntaken pains to fortify himself with credentials from the Government,\r\nand had obtained excellent letters from President John Tyler, Daniel\r\nWebster, Secretary of State, General Winfield Scott, who then held the\r\nhighest commission in the Army, John C. Spencer, Secretary of War, and\r\nLord Ashburton, a member of a special commission to settle the disputed\r\nboundary between Maine and the British provinces. The letters given him\r\nby Daniel Webster and President Tyler were as follows:[189]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Daniel Webster to Whom it May Concern_\r\n\r\n          UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n          DEPARTMENT OF STATE.\r\n\r\n     TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME—GREETING.\r\n\r\n     Know Ye, that the bearer hereof, John James Audubon,\r\n     a distinguished naturalist and native citizen of the\r\n     United States, has made known to me his intention of\r\n     travelling on the continent with the view principally of\r\n     aiding the cause of science by extending his researches\r\n     and explorations in natural history, and as he is known\r\n     to me to be a man of character and honor and worthy of\r\n     all friendly offices and of all personal regard, these\r\n     are therefore to request all whom it may concern, to\r\n     permit him to pass freely, without let or molestation,\r\n     and to extend to him all such aid and protection as he\r\n     may need, and which becomes the hospitality of civilized\r\n     and friendly nations.\r\n\r\n     In testimony whereof I, Daniel Webster, Secretary of\r\n     State of the United States, have hereunto set my hand\r\n     and caused the seal of this department to be affixed at\r\n     the City of Washington, this the 24th day of July, A.

He is known to me to be a naturalist of\r\n     eminent acquirements and estimation, a man of character\r\n     and honor and worthy of all personal respect and regard.\r\n     I recommend him to my countrymen abroad and to the\r\n     authorities and inhabitants of other countries that he\r\n     may receive the friendly offices, aid and countenance\r\n     which are due to the interests of science and the rites\r\n     of hospitality among civilized nations.\r\n\r\n          JOHN TYLER,\r\n\r\n          President of the U.

I\r\n     have a season ticket on the railroad, and, on my weekly\r\n     visits, I do much of my writing on Natural History. The\r\n     moment the clock strikes four I am up, and soon at work.\r\n     From this hour until seven, I have no interruptions.\r\n     I hope in this way to steal time to write about\r\n     _Quadrupeds_. When I get fairly under way, as I am now,\r\n     I am not easily diverted from the object before me, and\r\n     nothing but ill health or domestic affliction will keep\r\n     me back.\r\n\r\n          J. B.\r\n\r\nOn September 12 Audubon set out on a canvassing tour of Canada, on\r\nwhich he went as far north as Quebec; as he passed his home, he hailed\r\nhis sons, who were sailing on the river, and the sight of them at this\r\nmoment brought tears to his eyes. Whitehall, New York, was reached on\r\nSeptember 13, St. Johns, Canada, on the following day, and on the 15th\r\nhe was in Montreal; three days were spent at Quebec (September 16-18),\r\nwhere, as at other points, he met with the most gratifying success.\r\nAfter reaching home in October, the following glowing account of this\r\ntour and of the attractions of his new estate on the Hudson was given\r\nin a letter to Dr. Benjamin Phillips of London,[191] dated from \"New\r\nYork, 7th Nov., 1842\":\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    AFTER A PORTRAIT PAINTED BY JOHN WOODHOUSE AUDUBON ABOUT 1841, NOW\r\n    IN POSSESSION OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, NEW YORK.\r\n    PUBLISHED BY COURTESY OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Dr. Benjamin Phillips_\r\n\r\n     I went on a tramp to the Canadas, leaving our\r\n     comfortable abode on the 12th of Sepr. last and was\r\n     absent for a whole month. My Journey extended to\r\n     something like 1500 miles: during which I visited for\r\n     the first time, the North-American Gibralter [Quebec],\r\n     the sight of which was as new to me as it was wonderful\r\n     in the days of old. The views (for I must speak in the\r\n     plural) from the Citadel, are as far as I have seen\r\n     the grandest and the most sublime I ever gazed upon.\r\n     The St. Laurence River, is noble indeed, and when we\r\n     know that that stream carried forth to the Atlantic the\r\n     congregating waters of all our sea-lakes, we must not\r\n     be astonished at her great breadth, depth, and strength\r\n     of current to about 60 miles below Montreal. About the\r\n     latter city that noble stream is intercepted by many\r\n     rapids, and a vast number of Islands, the latter of\r\n     which so intersect the view that in some instances it\r\n     would prove quite out of the question to discover with\r\n     certainty either of the main shores. I visited the falls\r\n     of Montmorency, those of the Rivierre Serria and of\r\n     La Chan[u]diere. I besides made many an acquaintance\r\n     and a few very valuable friends. At Quebec I sold a\r\n     copy of our large Work to the Earl of Caledon who also\r\n     subscribed to our quadrupeds. At Montreal I sold several\r\n     Copies of our Small Edition of the Birds of America\r\n     and procured several good names to the quadrupeds. At\r\n     Kingston where I had the pleasure of becoming acquainted\r\n     with Sir Charles Bagot and family (all delightful\r\n     persons) I sold two copies of the large work to both\r\n     Houses of Parliament, and also procured their double\r\n     subscriptions to the Animals. Thus I returned home\r\n     highly pleased with all that I had done and seen. The\r\n     more perhaps because I procured in the meantime most\r\n     valuable specimens of rare quadrupeds and a fund of\r\n     information that can never be met with unless on the\r\n     ground of action....\r\n\r\n     Our dear \"Minnie's Land\" is improving as fast as our\r\n     poor pecuniary means will allow. We have done a good\r\n     deal since our purchase of it, in a wild state as it\r\n     was, and next spring we will have a good garden and\r\n     probably some fruit from our own young trees, of which\r\n     we have planted nearly 200 of the very best description,\r\n     including pears, aples, quinces, apricote, plumbs,\r\n     vines, nectarines, apricotes, etc., etc.... We have fish\r\n     whenever we draw the seine, and this summer we have\r\n     caught one sturgeon that measured upwards of 8 feet\r\n     ... weight more than 200 pounds.... The \"Boys\" take\r\n     a sailing pretty frequently in their sail boat, but I\r\n     never join them in that, for attempts I have crossed the\r\n     Atlantic pretty frequently I have an inward dislike to\r\n     the water, after it is more than 2 or 3 fathoms deep!\r\n     We have now been enjoying that delightful season, which\r\n     our Americans call the \"Indian Summer\" and not a drop of\r\n     rain have we had for several weeks.... Would that you\r\n     all were here at this moment, at my elbow, from which\r\n     by a peep at the window, I gaze on the \"Pallisades\" and\r\n     the breath of the Hudson, between the trunks of the many\r\n     trees that stand at rest at present awaiting the return\r\n     of spring for a renewal of fragrant verdure, and fruits\r\n     innumerable....\r\n\r\n     We would be glad if you would ascertain whether a good\r\n     agent can be had to procure subscribers in England\r\n     for it [the _Quadrupeds_], or whether a responsible\r\n     bookseller would buy the copyright, & a certain number\r\n     of plates either coloured or plain.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Audubon wrote also to William Yarrell, hoping to\r\ninterest him in the foreign sale of his new publication, but as will be\r\nseen by his friend's reply, now to be given, with indifferent success:\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Yarrell to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          [Superscribed by Audubon]\r\n          Recd _28 Jany 1843_\r\n\r\n          [Addressed] J.

AUDUBON,\r\n\r\n     I have this morning received your letter of the 28th.\r\n     Novr. last, and as it is strictly a letter of business,\r\n     I reply to its various parts immediately.\r\n\r\n     About a month ago I received a note from Mr. Phillips\r\n     to say that he had received the Plates of the first\r\n     number of your work on the Quadrupeds of America—would\r\n     I come and look at them, and would I exhibit them at\r\n     the meetings of the Societies I belonged to for the\r\n     promotion of Natural History. I went to see them, and\r\n     have with pleasure exhibited them at the Linnean Society\r\n     on the third Tuesday in Novr. and at the Scientific\r\n     evening, as well as the monthly general meeting of\r\n     the Zoological Society, both of which occurred early\r\n     in Decr. and I then returned the 5 Plates to Mr.\r\n     Phillips—They were very much admired but I did not\r\n     obtain any request for a supply.\r\n\r\n     In reference to your next request, I must decline any\r\n     connection with the sale or publication of this, or\r\n     indeed any other foreign work, in this country. The\r\n     truth is, that having now been in the business nearly\r\n     forty years, I begin to be tired of work; the last part\r\n     of my History of British Birds will be published on the\r\n     1st of June 1843; with that part I shall give up my pen,\r\n     and write for money no more.\r\n\r\n     You are kind enough to give me some credit for\r\n     experience as a publisher, and some knowledge of the\r\n     persons who are likely to be purchasers of works on\r\n     Natural History here—My conviction is that you would\r\n     gain more by paying full commission to an established\r\n     Bookseller in London who would by advertising make your\r\n     works known, and where they might be obtained—than you\r\n     will by the best efforts of any private friend, even\r\n     though his kindness should induce him to take all the\r\n     trouble for nothing.\r\n\r\n     You say nothing about your family. I hope they are all\r\n     well.\r\n\r\n          I remain, Dear Sir,\r\n          Yours very truly\r\n\r\n          Wm YARRELL.\r\n\r\n          J. J. AUDUBON Esqr.\r\n\r\n          77 William Street.\r\n          New York.\r\n\r\nIn the following letter to Spencer Baird, Audubon was able to outline\r\nmore fully his final plans for the western journey:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird_\r\n\r\n          NEW YORK, _Nov. 29, 1842_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND,\r\n\r\n     It seems to me as if an age had already elapsed since\r\n     I have heard from you or your whereabouts. Neither do\r\n     I know clearly whether in the way of correspondence,\r\n     you are in my debt, or I am in yours. Nevertheless I\r\n     now write to you, and request you to read this letter\r\n     more than once, and think deeply on the purport of its\r\n     contents that you may be the [more] able to form a true\r\n     Idea of what I intend to say [to] you, and for yourself\r\n     to give me a true answer, on which I can depend, no\r\n     matter whether it is to my liking or not.\r\n\r\n     It is now determined that I shall go towards the Rocky\r\n     Mountains at least to the Yellowstone River, and up\r\n     the latter Stream four hundred miles, and _perhaps_ go\r\n     across the Rocky Mountains. I have it in my power to\r\n     proceed to the Yellowstone by Steamer from St. Louis on\r\n     the 1st day of April next; or to go to the \"_Mountains\r\n     of the Wind_\" in the very heart and bosom of the\r\n     Rocky Mountains in the company of Sir William Drommond\r\n     Stewart, Baronet who will leave on the 1st of May next\r\n     also from St. Louis.\r\n\r\n     It has occurred to me that perchance you would like\r\n     to spare a few months of your life, to visit the great\r\n     Western Wilderness, and perhaps again prefer going in\r\n     my Company in preference to that of any other person?\r\n     Of this of course I cannot Judge without your answer to\r\n     this. I thought that you would have been in New York\r\n     long ere this, but not a Word of you has reached any\r\n     friend of yours here for several months. I have had an\r\n     abundance of applications from different sections of the\r\n     country, from Young Gents who proffer much efficiency,\r\n     etc., but I do not know them as I know you, and if the\r\n     terms which I am about to propose to you will answer\r\n     your own views, I wish you to write to me at once\r\n     so that I may know how to prepare myself for such a\r\n     Journey, and under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n     Would you like to go with me at any rate? By which I\r\n     mean, whether by Land, or by Water, and undertake,\r\n     besides acting towards me as a friend, to prepare\r\n     whatever skins of Birds or Quadrupeds, I may think\r\n     fit for us to bring home. The Birds, you might have\r\n     one half as your own, the Quadrupeds, (should you wish\r\n     it) you might have a 4th or every 4th specimen of the\r\n     same species, reserving to myself all that is new or\r\n     exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\n     I will procure and furnish _all the materials_ for\r\n     skinning, preparing, and saving whatever we may find\r\n     in Ornithology and in Mammalia, and in all probability\r\n     (if you think it absolutely necessary) pay one half\r\n     your expenses from the time we leave St. Louis until\r\n     our return to that city. You will have to work hard,\r\n     of course, but then I trust to that the knowledge\r\n     alone which you must acquire would prove a sufficient\r\n     compensation, and as you already know me pretty well, I\r\n     need not say to you that I am not \"hard on the trigger.\"\r\n\r\n     It will be necessary for you to provide a good double\r\n     barrelled Gun, and an excellent Rifle, Shot bag, powder\r\n     flask, &c, a good hatchet, and a sufficiency of clothes\r\n     for something like a 12 month's Campaign. But if you\r\n     will write me at once upon the subject, I can give you\r\n     a more and a better a/c of all my intentions, than is at\r\n     present necessary.\r\n\r\n     If all goes on as I trust it will go on, we may be back\r\n     home by Octr. or Novr. next, 1843.\r\n\r\n     Do not lose a moment in writing to me in answer to this\r\n     after you have thought _deeply_ upon the matter.\r\n\r\n     Remember me kindly to all your friends, and believe me,\r\n\r\n          Yours Always,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n          77 Williams Street, New York.\r\n\r\nBaird was unable to reach a decision in the matter, and Audubon\r\nactually wrote five more letters on the subject and kept a place open\r\nfor his young friend for nearly three months. On January 2, 1843,\r\nhe said that while it was impossible to determine with any degree\r\nof accuracy the amount of money the journey might require, he could\r\n\"safely say that the sum of $500. would prove all sufficient, as our\r\npassages to the Yellow Stone will be granted us free; and the expenses\r\nfrom here or from Carlisle cannot exceed 50$ to St. Louis, and may\r\nbe less.\" \"I have given up,\" he added, \"all Idea of going South this\r\nseason, being determined to draw quadrupeds until a few days of my\r\nleaving home for this grand and Last Journey, I intend to make as a\r\nNaturalist.\" Again, on January 31, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     It appears from the whole tenure of your letter, that\r\n     that rascally article _cash_ is the cause which prevents\r\n     you from going along with me to the Yellowstone River\r\n     and back. Now, it happens that although we are far from\r\n     being rich, we are all desirous that you should go along\r\n     with me, because we all know you, and I particularly\r\n     so. Therefore, if you will go with me, and assist me all\r\n     you can, in the way of hunting, measuring and dissecting\r\n     Specimens when I am otherwise engaged, etc. etc. I will\r\n     furnish you with all that may be necessary for your\r\n     expenses, excepting your clothing and your gun or guns,\r\n     as you may have them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LETTER OF EDWARD HARRIS TO AUDUBON, REGARDING HIS\r\n    INTENTION OF JOINING THE EXPEDITION TO THE UPPER MISSOURI, JANUARY\r\n     31, 1843. From the Deane MSS.]\r\n\r\nIn still another letter, of February 10, Audubon said:\r\n\r\n     That your kind mother should feel great reluctance in\r\n     the premises, does not astonish me, as my own good Wife\r\n     was much against my going on so long a Journey; but her\r\n     Strong Sense of what is best for us all, and as well\r\n     as in myself, the perfect confidence that our Maker's\r\n     Will will be done, she has now no Scruples of any kind,\r\n     and as for myself I rely as much as I ever have done\r\n     in the Support of the Almighty Being who has supported\r\n     and secured me against evils of all sorts in my Various\r\n     undertakings, and with this Idea at my heart, I feel\r\n     confident that although an Old Man, I could undertake\r\n     any Journey whatever, and no matter of their lengths\r\n     or difficulties. But I wish you would assure your good\r\n     mother that to go to Yellow Stone River, in a good\r\n     Steamer, as passengers by the courteous offers of the\r\n     President of the American Fur Company who himself will\r\n     go along with us, that the difficulties that existed\r\n     some 30 years ago in such undertakings are now rendered\r\n     as Smooth and easy as it is to go to Carlisle and return\r\n     to N. Y. as many times as would make up the Sum in Miles\r\n     of about 3000: Our difficulties (if any there are) will\r\n     be felt on our return; when we must come back to St.\r\n     Louis in one or 2 open boats in Sepr and part of Octr\r\n     next. The passage being longer or shorter accordingly\r\n     with the state of the Missouri at that Season.[192]\r\n\r\nYoung Baird would gladly have accompanied Audubon, but the fears of\r\nhis friends for his health and safety interposed, and the party as\r\neventually made up comprised, beside the naturalist, John G. Bell, as\r\ntaxidermist, Isaac Sprague, artist, Lewis Squires, general assistant\r\nand secretary, and his old friend Edward Harris.\r\n\r\nAudubon left his home on March 11, 1843, with Victor, who accompanied\r\nhim as far as Philadelphia, where a rendezvous was made before\r\nstarting west. The party went first to Baltimore, and by steam cars to\r\nCumberland, then by coach through the Gap, and across the Alleghanies\r\nto Wheeling, where a steamer took them down river to Cincinnati. On\r\nMarch 19 they reached Louisville, where Audubon spent four days with\r\nhis brother-in-law, William G. Bakewell, and on the 28th they arrived\r\nat St. Louis, where the party completed their outfit. On April 25 they\r\nbegan their ascent to the Missouri, in the steamer _Magnet_, a small\r\nvessel belonging to the American Fur Company, with a motley crowd\r\nof trappers, employed by the Company, representing French creoles,\r\nCanadian French, Indians, and other nationalities.\r\n\r\nDuring this journey, which lasted eight months, Audubon kept a\r\nvoluminous journal, which was written in a fine hand on large sheets of\r\nlinen paper that could be easily rolled and carried in his pocket; this\r\nwas afterwards sent to Bachman, was returned, and was lost for fifty\r\nyears, or until 1896, when it was recovered from an old secretary by\r\nAudubon's granddaughters, one of whom published it in 1898.[193] It is\r\na highly interesting and spirited narrative from beginning to end, and\r\nabounds in graphic pictures of the Indians and trappers, the military\r\nposts and pioneer settlements, the abundant bird life and big game,\r\nthe biggest of which, the buffalo, was then seen by Audubon in a state\r\nof nature for the first time, the grand and turbulent rivers, and the\r\nsmiling or frowning face of the great wilderness so soon to be changed\r\nby the devastating hands of civilized man.\r\n\r\nWhat Audubon thought to be a new finch, discovered near the Snake\r\nHills in Missouri, was named for Edward Harris, and though it proved\r\nto have been previously described, the bird is still known as \"Harris'\r\nFinch\"; a few days later a new vireo, _Vireo bellii_, received the name\r\nof John G. Bell, his taxidermist, and similar honors were passed to\r\nartist Isaac Sprague, to whom was dedicated the little titlark, _Alauda\r\nspragueii_, now _Anthus spraguei_.\r\n\r\nIn those days of river navigation, the frequent tying up for fuel or\r\nnecessary repairs, not to speak of grounding in a treacherous channel,\r\ngave almost daily opportunities for the hunters to go ashore, and these\r\noccasions seldom failed to produce something interesting, new, or rare.\r\nIn the Indian country, at Bellevue, Nebraska, where they touched to\r\nland a part of their cargo, Audubon \"saw a trick of the trade, which\r\nmade _him_ laugh. Eight cords of wood were paid for with five tin\r\ncups of sugar and three of coffee—value at St. Louis about twenty-five\r\ncents.\"\r\n\r\nThey began to meet with buffalo about the mouth of the James River,\r\nin South Dakota, on May 20; the ground, said Audubon, was literally\r\ncovered with their tracks, and the bushes with their hair. On the same\r\nday they discovered \"Meadow Larks whose songs and single notes _were_\r\nquite different from those of the Eastern States,\" and this proved to\r\nbe the first notice of the Western Meadow Lark, which later appeared\r\nas the _Sturnella neglecta_ in the small edition of his _Birds of\r\nAmerica_, then in course of publication.\r\n\r\nAudubon's opinion of the Indian was modified considerably after having\r\nseen him in the western wilderness, and his confidence in George\r\nCatlin's descriptions was completely shattered; \"His book,\" he said,\r\n\"must, after all, be altogether a humbug. Poor devil! I pity him from\r\nthe bottom of my soul; had he studied, and kept up to the old French\r\nproverb that says, 'Bon Renommé vaut mieux que ceinture doré,' he might\r\nhave become an honest man—the quintessence of God's works.\"\r\n\r\nAfter forty-eight days and seven hours out of St. Louis, on the 12th\r\nof June, they reached Fort Union, at the mouth of the Yellowstone,\r\nwhere the _Omega_ left them and returned down river. The country proved\r\nso interesting that the naturalist remained two months at the fort,\r\nwhere he occupied the room which had been used by Maximilian, Prince\r\nof Neuwied, when traveling through the western parts of America ten\r\nyears before; here Audubon made many drawings. Buffalo were abundant\r\non all sides, and a favorite occupation was shooting wolves from the\r\nramparts of the fort. On June 18 they killed two antelope and two deer\r\nbefore noon, and \"immediately after dinner,\" he said, \"the head of the\r\nold male was cut off, and I went to work outlining it; first small,\r\nwith the camera lucida, and then by squares.\" On the 30th he wrote: \"I\r\nbegan drawing at five this morning, and worked almost without cessation\r\ntill after three, when becoming fatigued for want of practice, I took\r\na short walk, regretting that I could no longer draw twelve or fourteen\r\nhours without a pause, or thought of weariness.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of July they started up the shore of the Yellowstone in\r\na cart. The party soon had had enough of buffalo hunting, and on one\r\nday the naturalist was nearly speared by a charging bull that had been\r\nwounded. \"What a terrible destruction of life,\" he says, \"as it were\r\nfor nothing, or next to it, as the tongues only were brought in, and\r\nthe flesh of these fine animals was left to beasts and birds of prey,\r\nor to rot on the spots where they fell. The prairies are literally\r\n_covered_ with the skulls of the victims, and the roads the Buffalo\r\nmake in crossing the prairies have all the appearance of heavy wagon\r\ntracks.\" Foreseeing the departure of the buffalo, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     One can hardly conceive how it happens, notwithstanding\r\n     these many deaths and the immense numbers that are\r\n     murdered almost daily on these boundless wastes called\r\n     prairies, besides the hosts that are drowned in the\r\n     freshets, and the hundreds of young calves who die in\r\n     early spring, so many are yet to be found. Daily we see\r\n     so many that we hardly notice them more than the cattle\r\n     in our pastures about our homes. But this cannot last;\r\n     even now there is a perceptible difference in the size\r\n     of the herds, and before many years the Buffalo, like\r\n     the Great Auk, will have disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August he added: \"I have scarcely done anything but\r\nwrite this day, and my memorandum books are now crowded with sketches,\r\nmeasurements, and descriptions.\" Those who maintain that a \"howling\r\nwilderness\" is a place that never howls, should read his note for\r\nAugust 19: \"Wolves howling, and bulls roaring, just like the long\r\ncontinued roll of a hundred drums\"; or this for the 21st: \"Buffaloes\r\nall over the bars and prairies, and many swimming; the roaring can be\r\nheard for miles.\"\r\n\r\nAt Fort Union they built a Mackinaw barge forty feet long, which they\r\nchristened the \"Union,\" and on the 16th of August they started for\r\nSt. Louis, which was reached in safety on the 19th of October. There\r\nthey unloaded, and \"sent all things to Nicholas Berthoud's warehouse.\"\r\n\"Reached home,\" said Audubon, \"at 3 p. m., November 6th, 1843, and\r\nthank God, found all my family quite well.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Audubon was returning by the canal route from Pittsburgh to\r\nPhiladelphia, he was sought out by a young traveler, who afterwards\r\nrelated the following incident.[194] The naturalist, he was told, was\r\nunder \"a huge pile of green blankets and fur,\" which he had already\r\nnoticed on one of the benches, and had taken for the fat pile of some\r\nwestern trader. Having waived his choice of a berth in Audubon's favor,\r\nhe observed that \"the green bale stirred a little,—half turned upon its\r\nnarrow resting place, and after a while sat erect, and showed us, to\r\nour no small surprise, that a man was inside of it. A patriarchal beard\r\nfell white and wavy down his breast; a pair of hawk-like eyes glanced\r\nsharply out of a fuzzy shroud of cap and collar.\" When this stranger,\r\ndrawn by a sense of irrepressible curiosity, had ventured near enough\r\nto recognize the \"noble Roman countenance\" thus obscured, he saw that\r\nit was Audubon in his wilderness dress; he was \"hale and erect, with\r\nsixty winters upon his shoulders, and like one of his old eagles,\r\nfeathered to the heel.\" Audubon's conversation, said this writer, was\r\nimpulsive and fragmentary, but he showed him with pleasure some of his\r\noriginal drawings of animals, as well as a living collection of foxes,\r\nbadgers and Rocky Mountain deer, which he was bringing home.\r\n\r\nTo follow this narrator further:\r\n\r\n     The confinement we were subjected to on board the\r\n     canal-boat was very tiresome to his habits of freedom.\r\n     We used to get ashore and walk for hours along the\r\n     tow-path ahead of the boat; and I observed with\r\n     astonishment that, though over sixty, he could walk us\r\n     down with ease.... His physical energies seemed to be\r\n     entirely unimpaired.... Another striking evidence of\r\n     this he gave us. A number of us were standing grouped\r\n     around him on the top of the boat, one clear sunshiny\r\n     morning; we were at the time passing through a broken\r\n     and very picturesque region; his keen eyes, with an\r\n     abstracted, intense expression, peculiar to them, were\r\n     glancing over the scenery we were gliding through, when\r\n     suddenly he pointed with his finger towards the fence\r\n     of a field, about two hundred yards off. \"See! Yonder\r\n     is a Fox Squirrel, running along the top rail. It is\r\n     not often I have seen them in Pennsylvania.\" Now his\r\n     power of vision must have been singularly acute, to have\r\n     distinguished that it was a Fox Squirrel; for only one\r\n     other person ... detected the creature at all.\r\n\r\nThe second Mrs. Victor G. Audubon[195] said that on the day the\r\nnaturalist returned, \"the whole family, with his old friend, Captain\r\nCummings, were on the piazza waiting for the carriage to come from\r\nHarlem.... He had on a green blanket coat with fur collar and cuffs;\r\nhis hair and beard were very long, and he made a fine striking\r\nappearance. In this dress his son John painted his portrait.\"[196]\r\nThis interesting portrait, which is still in possession of the family,\r\nand which is reproduced by his granddaughter in the work from which\r\nwe have just quoted, shows a man whose apparent age, as suggested by\r\nhis flowing white hair and grayish white beard, overshoots the clearer\r\ntestimony of his smooth face and bright eye; as already noticed,\r\nAudubon had not then attained his sixtieth year.\r\n\r\nUpon his return at this time Audubon is said to have been mistaken for\r\na Dunker, or member of a sect of Quakers noted for their ample beards.\r\nOn November 29 Bachman wrote: \"I am glad to hear that your great beard\r\nis now cut off. I pictured you to myself, as I saw you in my home, when\r\nyou came from Florida, _via_ Savannah. You jumped down from the top\r\nof the stage. Your beard, two months old, was as gray as a Badger's. I\r\nthink a grizzly-bear, forty-seven years old, would have claimed you as\r\n'par nobile fratrum.'\" Bachman was apparently disturbed about Audubon's\r\npersonal habits at this time, for he added in the letter just quoted:\r\n\"I am a teatotaler. I drink _no wine_, and do not use _snuff_. I hope\r\nthat you are able to say the same.\"[197]\r\n\r\nSpencer Baird wrote to Audubon from Washington, November 24, 1843, to\r\ncongratulate him upon the safe return of his western party, saying:\r\n\"From time to time short notices of your whereabouts and doings\r\nappeared in the newspaper and a thousand times I wished that the fears\r\nof my friends had not prevented me from accompanying you to the scenes\r\nof action.\" Audubon thought that he might well regret the difficulties\r\nthat had stood in his way; in replying he said that he had seen \"not\r\none Rattlesnake and heard not a Word of bilious fever, or [experienced]\r\nanything more troublesome than Moschitoes and of these by no means\r\nmany\"; they had brought home a Swift Fox, an American Badger, and a\r\nlive Deer, which they thought might prove to be new, fifteen new birds,\r\nas well as a certain number of quadrupeds, besides \"many of the Birds\r\nprocured on the Western side of the Big Rocky Hills by Nuttall and\r\nTownsend.\" He felt that much still remained to be done, his only regret\r\nbeing that he was not what he \"was 25 Years ago, Strong and Active, for\r\nwilling he was as much as ever.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Audubon brought to a close his octavo edition of the\r\n_Birds_ by adding seventeen species, eleven of which were new and\r\nrepresented his discoveries on the Upper Missouri of the previous\r\nyear. The 500th plate, and last of the series which marked the end of\r\nAudubon's life-long labors in ornithology, was dedicated to \"Baird's\r\nBunting,\" _Emberiza bairdii_. \"If a trace of sentiment be permissible\r\nin bibliography,\" said Elliott Coues,[198] \"I should say that the\r\ncompletion of that splendid series of plates with the name _bairdii_\r\nwas significant; the glorious Audubonian sun had set indeed, but in\r\nthe dedicating of the species to his young friend Spencer F. Baird\r\nthe scepter was handed to one who was to wield it with a force that no\r\nother ornithologist of America has ever exercised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nFINAL WORK DAYS\r\n\r\n     Painting the _Quadrupeds_—Assistance of Bachman and\r\n     Audubon's sons—Copper plates of the _Birds_ go through\r\n     the fire in New York—Audubon a spectator at the\r\n     ruins—Bachman's ultimatum—Success of the illustrations\r\n     of the _Quadrupeds_—Bachman's letterpress—Recommendation\r\n     of Baird—John W. Audubon in London—Bachman's\r\n     assistants—His life and labors—Decline of Audubon's\r\n     powers—Dr. Brewer's visit—Audubon's last letters—His\r\n     death at \"Minnie's Land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 1844 Audubon's remaining energies were devoted exclusively to\r\nhis work on the _Quadrupeds_, in which it is necessary to discriminate\r\nbetween the large folio of illustrations, which began to appear, in\r\nparts, as early as 1842 and which was completed in 1846; the text, of\r\nwhich he lived to see but one volume finished; and lastly, the first\r\nand only composite edition of both text and plates, which was published\r\nby Victor Audubon in 1854.[199] This series of works, as already\r\nnoticed, was produced in collaboration with the Reverend John Bachman,\r\nof Charleston, South Carolina; Bachman assumed entire responsibility\r\nfor the text, but owing to his comparative isolation from large\r\nlibraries, and to the demands of professional duties, he depended on\r\nthe Audubons to supply him with specimens and books.\r\n\r\nHonest John Bachman, whose motto was, \"Nature, Truth, and no Humbug,\"\r\nwas suffering sadly, he said, from lack of tools, when he wrote to\r\nVictor Audubon in November, 1844:[200]\r\n\r\n     The books are to be found in New York and Philadelphia,\r\n     but are expensive. I would not have you buy them; but\r\n     could you not copy for me such articles as we need?\r\n\r\n     I enclose my plan. I wish always, a month before the\r\n     time, that you would give me notice of the species you\r\n     intend to put into the hands of the engraver, and send\r\n     me, at the same time, the specimen. I cannot describe\r\n     without it; I will guess at nothing.\r\n\r\n     I find the labor greater than I expected, and fear that\r\n     I may break down and, therefore, cry in time, \"Help\r\n     me Cassius or I sink!\" Writing descriptions is slow\r\n     and fatiguing work. I cannot, in the careful manner\r\n     that I am doing them write more than three in a week.\r\n     My son-in-law, Haskell, has copied forty-two closely\r\n     written pages for me. I cannot shorten the articles,\r\n     many of them I ought rather to lengthen. With patience\r\n     and the help of all, I hope, however, to get on—the work\r\n     may be lighter as we proceed.\r\n\r\n     The following is my daily practice: I am up at 4 A. M.,\r\n     and work till breakfast, and recently, when parochial\r\n     duties would permit, have kept on until 3 P. M.\r\n\r\n     The brush of my old friend, Audubon, is a truth-teller.\r\n     I regard his drawings as the best in the world. Let us\r\n     be very careful to correct any errors of description\r\n     that have crept in on the plates—I see a few in the\r\n     lettering—they can be corrected in the letter-press; and\r\n     let us be so cautious as to have nothing in the future\r\n     to correct. There is but one principle on which a just\r\n     man can act; that is, always to seek the truth and to\r\n     abide by it.\r\n\r\nBachman wrote again on the 29th of that month:\r\n\r\n     About the little mouse—I cannot see a needle in a\r\n     haystack; or give it a name without knowing what it\r\n     is. Friend, descriptions cannot be written, as a man\r\n     works at making Jews-harps—so many a dozen in a given\r\n     time. My credit, as well as your father's, is so deeply\r\n     concerned, that _I will not publish a day before I am\r\n     ready_....\r\n\r\n     I have such confidence in you, that I believe that you\r\n     will do all that I wish. In doing this, however, you\r\n     will have your hands full. Mine are so—God knows! Will\r\n     not my old friend, Audubon, wake up, and work as he used\r\n     to do, when we banged at the Herons and the fresh water\r\n     Marsh-hens?\r\n\r\nBachman explained that he was the \"schoolmaster,\" and when the boys\r\nwere a little lazy, he would have to apply the whip.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1844, Spencer Baird sent Audubon a live Pennant's Marten\r\nor Fisher, a rather rare animal even at that time, and now all but\r\nextinct. Said Baird:[201]\r\n\r\n     It was found in company with an older one, in Peter's\r\n     mountain, six miles above Harrisburg about five weeks\r\n     ago. After a most desperate resistance the old one\r\n     was killed, having beaten off a large pack of dogs, to\r\n     whose assistance the hunters were obliged to run. This\r\n     individual ran up a tree, and being stoned by the men,\r\n     jumped off to a distance of forty feet! when being a\r\n     little stunned by the leap they ran up quickly and threw\r\n     their coats over it, and then secured it. The old one\r\n     measured three feet and a half from nose to end of tail,\r\n     and was about one third larger than this.... It seems\r\n     to be in very good health, and is without exception the\r\n     most unmitigatedly savage beast I ever saw. The Royal\r\n     Bengal Tiger, or the Laughing Hyena are neither of them\r\n     circumstances to it.\r\n\r\nAudubon used this marten as the model for his illustration of the\r\nspecies (shown in natural size, Plate xli of the _Quadrupeds_); in\r\nnoticing its habits later, he said:[202]\r\n\r\n     We kept this individual alive for some days, feeding it\r\n     on raw meat, pieces of chicken, and now and then a bird.\r\n     It was voracious, and very spiteful, growling, snarling\r\n     and spitting when approached, but did not appear to\r\n     suffer much uneasiness from being held in captivity, as,\r\n     like many other predacious quadrupeds it grew fat, being\r\n     better supplied with food than when it had been obliged\r\n     to cater for itself in the woods.\r\n\r\nBaird also tried to secure for Audubon the \"far-famed catamount\" alive,\r\nwhich, from stories related by hunters, he thought might be different\r\nfrom the young of the panther or puma, and also a specimen of the\r\ntrue black fox in the flesh; though unsuccessful in either quest, his\r\nefficient aid was greatly appreciated by his friend. In February, 1845,\r\nBaird paid a visit to the Audubons at their Hudson River home, where\r\nhe was warmly received; as his biographer relates,[203] upon leaving\r\nhe was invited to select any duplicate bird skins he desired from the\r\nnaturalist's collection, then at John G. Bell's taxidermist shop in New\r\nYork; he accepted this generous offer, and chose about forty specimens.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that some trouble-maker had disturbed the serenity of\r\nJohn Bachman's mind when the following interesting letter was written\r\nby Audubon to balm the feelings of his old friend. It is evident that\r\nAudubon at this time expected to collaborate in the letterpress of\r\ntheir work, but that plan, according to Bachman's own statement, was\r\nnever carried out:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DRAWINGS FOR \"THE VIVIPAROUS QUADRUPEDS OF NORTH\r\n    AMERICA\": ABOVE, AMERICAN PORCUPINE, DATED \"NEW YORK, MARCH 6,\r\n    1842,\" AND PUBLISHED IN 1844; BELOW, RABBITS.\r\n\r\n    After the originals in water color in possession of the American\r\n    Museum of Natural History, New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to John Bachman_\r\n\r\n          [MINNIE'S LAND] _Jan. 8, 1845_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND\r\n\r\n     Never have I been so much astonished as I have been\r\n     at reading your letter to Victor, and to which I feel\r\n     myself bound to answer at once.\r\n\r\n     In the first place you must have been most unmercifully\r\n     misled by the \"mutual friend\" of whom you speak, when\r\n     saying that through that individual _you did_ understand\r\n     that I never used your name as a coadjutor in the work,\r\n     which is now publishing on the Quadrupeds of North\r\n     America under the names of both I and you—Why you should\r\n     have taken such a report or saying as truth is actually\r\n     beyond my most remote thought, and again, why did you\r\n     not long ago, write to me at once on this mysterious\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     But to put an end to all this stuff, let me assure you\r\n     that nothing of the kind has ever taken place, and this\r\n     I could well prove by upwards of one hundred of our\r\n     last subscribers, all of whom would be ready to testify\r\n     that before receiving their names on my list, I always\r\n     mentioned your name to each of them, and many that know\r\n     you were glad that I had so good and so learned a man\r\n     at my elbow—I should amazingly be glad to know who the\r\n     \"mutual friend\" is, as I think I could give him a lesson\r\n     on propriety, being a mutual friend, that would serve\r\n     that kind gentleman for the residue of his life—But\r\n     enough of this, and all that I am sorry for is that you\r\n     should not have answered \"my short letters,\" in some of\r\n     which I particularly requested you to forward me a fine\r\n     black bear and one or two wolves, by which you would\r\n     have saved me fully fifty dollars as I have had to pay\r\n     sixty dollars for two of these vile rascals, and two\r\n     hundred dollars for a pair of Elks besides paying the\r\n     highest of prices to draw other animals—\r\n\r\n     Now my friend I wish you would set in real earnest,\r\n     and whenever it is convenient to you in preparing the\r\n     letter-press for our work. I have made a beginning and\r\n     have written Ten articles already in — days, to wit all\r\n     the plates of No 1, and the first of No 2 which are as\r\n     follows—\r\n\r\n          Lynx Rufus—Wild-Cat\r\n          Arctomys monax—Maryland Marmot\r\n          Lepus Townsendii\r\n          Neotoma Floridana\r\n          Sciurus Richardsonii\r\n          Canis (Vulpes) fulvus\r\n          The Beaver\r\n          The history of the Bison 28 pages\r\n          and Fiber Zybethicus (muskrat) 12 pages,\r\n          Tamias quadrivittatus\r\n\r\n     This will shew you that I have not been very Idle since\r\n     I began and I should like to know from you, whether you\r\n     would like to see what I have said of these, as if you\r\n     do, I will have them copied as soon as I receive your\r\n     letter, and will forward the whole, and the additional\r\n     written in the interim, at the same time. I have a\r\n     beautiful drawing of a fine male moose, that of the Elk\r\n     is already engraved, and next week we will forward to\r\n     the engraver no less than five or six drawings of the\r\n     best quality. by the way I am sorry that you should\r\n     look upon the Texan Skunk as a bad figure.

A.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1845, a destructive fire devastated a large section of the\r\ncity of New York, including the warehouse in which the copperplates of\r\nAudubon's _Birds_ were stored; many believed that the plates had been\r\nruined, and one of these was the writer who after witnessing the event\r\ngave the following dramatic account:[204]\r\n\r\n     But who had lost most of all that pale crowd that hung\r\n     like ghosts around the scene, and gazed with watery\r\n     eyes, and blue compressed lips, over the ruin? An erect\r\n     old man, with long white hair, glanced his strong bright\r\n     eye as coldly over the glowing, smoking desolation, as\r\n     an eagle would, who watched the sunrise chasing mists up\r\n     from the valley. J. J. Audubon looks over the grave of\r\n     the labor of forty years!\r\n\r\n     _The Plates of the Birds of America_ are buried beneath\r\n     those smoldering piles! Ye money changers dare not\r\n     break the stillness with a sob, though the last cent of\r\n     your sordid hoards be gone! ... go away! Ye have lost\r\n     nothing!... Yet that dauntless old man is not dismayed;\r\n     he and Fate knew each other's faces in battle long\r\n     ago. Let those who know how to love and venerate such\r\n     labors—to sympathize with such grievous calamities,\r\n     exhibit it in their prompt patronage of the new work now\r\n     issuing—The Quadrupeds of America—and in the care which\r\n     shall be taken to preserve the volumes of the Plates of\r\n     the Birds, now in existence—the value of which will be\r\n     five-fold increased!\r\n\r\nWhen Baird heard the untoward news, he wrote from Carlisle, August 4,\r\n1845: \"It is with sincerest regret that I see by the papers that your\r\ncopper plates were injured or perhaps ruined by the fire which occurred\r\na few weeks ago. Various reports are circulated respecting your loss,\r\nand among so many contradictory ones it is difficult to get at the\r\ntruth of the case. Might I ask you to let me know the truth of the\r\nmatter.\" In a postscript to this letter he added: \"I forgot to say that\r\nI have been elected professor of Natural History in Dickinson College.\r\nThe situation is entirely nominal, nothing to do & no salary whatever.\"\r\nAudubon replied promptly on the 7th of August:[205] \"You have been too\r\nwell-informed about the plates of our large work. They have indeed\r\npassed through the great fire of the 19 ul°; but we are now engaged\r\nin trying to restore them to their wonted former existence; although\r\na few of them will have to be reingraved for use, if ever that work is\r\nrepublished in its original size at all.\"\r\n\r\nBachman, who paid a long visit to the Audubons in the late summer\r\nor early autumn of 1845, said that while he was at \"Minnie's Land,\"\r\nAudubon painted \"Le Conte's Pine Mouse\" with his usual facility and\r\nskill, but he detected a change in his mental powers. For a long time\r\nBachman had complained of the want of books, which the younger Audubons\r\nfailed to supply, and of lack of specimens, which no doubt their\r\nfather wished to retain for use in his own studies, until at length his\r\npatience was gone and he tried another form of appeal. The following\r\nletter[206] to their mutual friend, Edward Harris, shows that he was\r\nthen determined to throw up the responsibility which had been assumed\r\nin the _Quadrupeds_ unless what he regarded as \"reasonable requests\"\r\nwere complied with forthwith:\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Bachman to Edward Harris_\r\n\r\n          CHARLESTON, _Decem. 24_, 1845.\r\n\r\n     Friend Harris, you can be of service to me, to the\r\n     Audubons & the cause of science. I will tell you how.\r\n\r\n     I find the Audubons are not aware of what is wanted\r\n     in the publication of the Quadrupeds. All they care\r\n     about is to get out a No. of engravings in two months.\r\n     They have not sent me one single book out of a list of\r\n     100 I gave them and only 6 lines copied from a book\r\n     after having written for them for 4 years. When he\r\n     published his birds he collected hundreds of thousands\r\n     of specimens. In his Quadrupeds—tell it not in Gath—He\r\n     never collected or sent me one skin from New York to\r\n     Louisiana along the whole of the Atlantic States. Now\r\n     he is clamorous for the letter press—on many of the\r\n     Quadrupeds he has not sent me one line & and on others\r\n     he has omitted even the geographical range—I know\r\n     nothing of what he did in the West having never received\r\n     his journal & not twenty lines on the subject. I am\r\n     to write a book without the information he promised to\r\n     give—without books of reference & above all what is a\r\n     sine qua non to me without specimens. In the meantime my\r\n     name is attached to the book, and the public look to us\r\n     to settle our American species, and alas I have not the\r\n     materials to do so.\r\n\r\n     Now this you can do for me. I am willing to write every\r\n     description and every line of the book. I do it without\r\n     fee or reward. But—1. Books of reference or copies\r\n     of them he must obtain. 2. He must publish no species\r\n     without my approbation. He has made some sad mistakes\r\n     already. 3. He must procure such information as I\r\n     shall write for. 4. _He must send some person—say when\r\n     John returns—to make a tour for collecting specimens\r\n     through the states of the west especially._ I find the\r\n     smaller Rodentia differing every 600 miles. Richardson's\r\n     species differ from those of New York—ours are once more\r\n     different from those of N. Y. Leib [?] found a number\r\n     of new species in Illinois. The New Orleans squirrels\r\n     differ from ours—California once more new. Now on this\r\n     last particular—the necessity of giving me specimens\r\n     to describe from I wish you to speak to Audubon. I\r\n     cannot consent to impose on the public. I cannot settle\r\n     the species without specimens. [Tell] him what I have\r\n     written and [of what I have] complained. Show him this\r\n     letter if you should [think] it will accomplish the\r\n     end. I shall soon have the volume finished as well as\r\n     I am able from the scanty materials with which I am\r\n     furnished. Then they will be clamorous for the second\r\n     volume. Now I do not like to make any threats, but if my\r\n     reasonable requests are not complied with I have made\r\n     up my mind not to write another line at the end of the\r\n     first volume. I have not made up my mind hastily. It is\r\n     the result of four years remonstrance, mortification,\r\n     and disappointment. Once and for nearly a year I gave up\r\n     the matter in hopeless despair. I again resumed it on\r\n     the solemn promise of Victor to do all I wished. Three\r\n     months have since gone round and not one book sent—only\r\n     ten lines copied—and a constant clamor for the letter\r\n     press. But I am called off.\r\n\r\nIf Audubon was remiss in supplying the necessary materials, it is\r\npossible that Bachman, in turn, may have failed to appreciate the load\r\nwhich his friend's shoulders had carried for the five years then past.\r\nTo Bachman specimens and books were, of course, absolutely essential,\r\nbut Audubon needed them also, as well as subscribers and the large sums\r\nof money necessary to keep his great enterprises in orderly movement.\r\nAt all events, Bachman's ultimatum brought immediate results, and it\r\nmight not be wide of the mark to affirm that to the tactful Harris we\r\nvirtually owe the completion of that admirable work, _The Viviparous\r\nQuadrupeds of North America_. It should be noticed that at the time the\r\ncomplaining letter was sent, John W. Audubon was in Texas, engaged in\r\nmaking collections, though, as it proved, with little success; Victor\r\nsearched the country for the needed books, and his father's Missouri\r\nRiver journal was despatched to Charleston, without delay.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day, 1846, Bachman wrote to his friend:\r\n\r\n     As I do not like to disappoint you in anything, I send\r\n     you one of the articles. It is about a fair sample of\r\n     the whole.... I try to incorporate as much as I can of\r\n     your own, but, in most cases, your notes have come too\r\n     late.\r\n\r\n     You see how plain Haskell writes: I should think that\r\n     by this time, he has copied three hundred pages as\r\n     correctly as the inclosed.\r\n\r\nIn his letter of March 6 he said:\r\n\r\n     For the last four nights, I have been reading your\r\n     journal. I am much interested, though I find less about\r\n     the quadrupeds than I expected. The narratives are\r\n     particularly spirited, and often instructive, as well\r\n     as amusing. All that you write on the spot, I can depend\r\n     on, but I never trust to the memory of others, any more\r\n     than to my own....\r\n\r\n     To return to your Journal. I am afraid that the shadows\r\n     of the Elk, Buffalo, and Bighorn hid the little Marmots,\r\n     Squirrels and Jumping Mice. I wish you had engaged some\r\n     of the hunters to set traps. I should like to get the\r\n     Rabbit that led you so weary a chase. Write to C.[207]\r\n     and find out some way of getting—not his princess\r\n     brain-eating, horse-straddling squaw, but what is better\r\n     than such a specimen from the Blackfoot country—1st. The\r\n     Skunk; 2nd, Hares, in Winter colors; and 3rd, the Rabbit\r\n     that you chased. In your Journal your descriptions of\r\n     Buffalo hunts are first rate. I don't like my article\r\n     on the \"Beaver\"; I shall have to write it over again.\r\n     If I could only borrow _Temminck's_ large work. Every\r\n     library here is open to me, and you would be astonished\r\n     to see the number of books in my own library; but the\r\n     scientific works of close comparison are not among them.\r\n     I had written letter after letter, but might have saved\r\n     ten dollars postage.\r\n\r\nAudubon wrote to Baird on February 2, 1846, to remind him of the\r\nCatamount, which was thought not to be \"the Cougar,\" and of the Black\r\nFox: \"for the latter,\" he said, \"I do give you my word that I would\r\nwillingly pay you Twenty Dollars by a draft upon us at Sight.\" In\r\nanother letter from \"Minnie's Land, N. Y.,\" of March 14, he said:[208]\r\n\r\n     Could you procure a black and a Silver Fox for us, we\r\n     will be willing to give a good price for either in the\r\n     flesh, and preserved in common New England Rum, and\r\n     forwarded by express to 78 John St, N.Y.\r\n\r\n     We expect to see John at home in about Six or Seven\r\n     weeks. He has made a very poor Journey of this one, and\r\n     will have to go to Europe this summer, I have no doubt.\r\n\r\nConcerning his son's journey to Texas, Audubon had written Spencer\r\nBaird, September 30, 1845:[209]\r\n\r\n     My son John will leave this for the West and South-West,\r\n     as far as the confines of Texas, about the last of\r\n     next month, and intends being absent until the first of\r\n     March. Would you like to go with him provided you can\r\n     pay your own expenses? He will take one of our Servant\r\n     men along to help him in the procuring of Quadrupeds and\r\n     Birds, of which he hopes to procure some, if not a good\r\n     number of new Species.\r\n\r\nAs Baird gave no reply, Audubon sat down on Christmas Day, 1845, and\r\nwrote again to his young friend:[210]\r\n\r\n     I hope and trust that you were not offended at my\r\n     letter, when I wrote you on the Subject of accompanying\r\n     our son John to Texas where he is now I hope safe and\r\n     sound, and I believe at Corpus Christi....\r\n\r\n     ... I have at last received a fine Red Fox from our\r\n     Friend Ed. Harris, who although he did not kill it,\r\n     obtained the Cunning Animal very shortly after its\r\n     death. I have drawn it to the size of life, and I think\r\n     made a good figure of it.\r\n\r\n     I have been drawing pretty constantly these last past\r\n     weeks and have finished 6 plates for the Engravers....\r\n     We are all hard at Work preparing the letterpress for\r\n     the 1st Vol. of the Quadrupeds, a copy of which I hope\r\n     to send to you about the beginning of April.\r\n\r\nAudubon's prediction in regard to his son was correct, and after\r\nJohn's return from Texas, in April, 1846, he started for England on\r\nJune 10, with his wife and family; he remained in Europe until May,\r\n1847, engaged, as his father said, \"in making figures of those arctic\r\nanimals, of which accessible specimens exist only in the museums of\r\nthat quarter of the globe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Audubons, as we have seen, now tried to keep John Bachman better\r\nsupplied, and in the spring of 1846 sent him several boxes of skins,\r\nwith the urgent request that all which pertained to animals that had\r\nnot been figured be returned as soon as possible. On March 13 Victor\r\nwrote that Temminck's monograph could not be found in all America,\r\nnot in Boston, or Philadelphia, but that a copy would be ordered\r\nfrom Europe at once. In those days Charleston was farther removed in\r\ntime from New York than California is now from Boston; two weeks was\r\nrequired for a letter of one naturalist to reach the other, and the\r\ndifficulties of coöperation were correspondingly great. On May 31\r\nAudubon acknowledged the return of the skins, but said: \"Judge of my\r\nastonishment, when I could not find a single one of the small animals,\r\nShrews, and Scalops argentatus, the latter of which I am anxious to\r\ndraw at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe summer and autumn of 1846 bore heavily on John Bachman, subject\r\nas he then was to a \"thousand calls and interruptions,\" and \"bowed\r\ndown, and almost distracted, with anxieties and grief.\"[211] But the\r\nfirst volume of the letterpress which had given him so much trouble was\r\nfinished in November, and was published by Audubon at the close of this\r\nyear. It was at once recognized as a standard and authoritative work,\r\nwhich was then without a competitor in America, and as Louis Agassiz\r\naffirmed, without an equal in Europe. At the time of its issue the\r\ntwentieth number of the folio illustrations was nearly ready; the text\r\nitself had 271 subscribers, calling for 281 copies,[212] though only\r\nthe eastern cities had then been canvassed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TITLE PAGE OF VOLUME I OF THE ENGLISH EDITION OF\r\n   THE TEXT OF \"THE VIVIPAROUS QUADRUPEDS OF NORTH AMERICA.\"]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1846 Baird wrote to Audubon:[213] \"I have made drawings of\r\nthe sculls of our quadrupeds which are at your service if you want\r\nthem. They are Mink, Wild Cat, Ground Hog, _Lepus Sylvaticus_, _Neotoma\r\nFloridana_ and others. I have got a Camera Lucida now and intend\r\ntrying to draw with it. Anything I can do for you in this way will be\r\ncheerfully done.\" When he wrote again, towards the close of this year,\r\nsome important events had happened, as shown by this letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spencer Fullerton Baird to Audubon_\r\n\r\n          CARLISLE _Nov. 4, 1846_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MR. AUDUBON\r\n\r\n     I have been intending to write for a long time, to\r\n     find out how you all are at Minnie's Landing, and how\r\n     yourself is particularly, but have put it off from time\r\n     to time for various reasons. I can do so no longer, and\r\n     must beg you to let me know these particulars.\r\n\r\n     Since my last visit to you, two pretty important events\r\n     have happened to me. The first was getting married,\r\n     the second, settling down steadily in my Professional\r\n     chair.[214] My wife is the only daughter of Col.\r\n     Churchill Inspector Gen. of the Army, now with Gen. Wool\r\n     in Mexico. She suits me exactly, being as fond of birds\r\n     & snakes & fishes etc. as myself. I have even given her\r\n     a lesson or two in taxidermy.\r\n\r\n     My duties as professor consist in teaching Animal\r\n     Physiology, Natural Theology & Mathematics. My salary is\r\n     small $400 but I hope will be larger hereafter. I have\r\n     to work hard, but that is good for me.\r\n\r\n     Please let me know how the quadrupeds get along. Is\r\n     the first vol. published? How does John get along in\r\n     England? What has become of his Texas birds?\r\n\r\n     Please to tell me the address of your friend Ayres. I\r\n     have been collecting fishes for some weeks, and wish to\r\n     correspond & exchange with him on this subject. I can\r\n     send him a good many species.\r\n\r\n     Please give my love to all your kind family. My wife (to\r\n     whom two years ago I gave a picture of yourself, as the\r\n     most acceptable present) sends hers also, and desires\r\n     exceedingly to see one to whom her husband owes so many\r\n     obligations of every kind. Believe to be as ever\r\n\r\n          Yours most affectionately\r\n\r\n          SPENCER F. BAIRD.\r\n\r\nAudubon's immediate reply was as follows:[215]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Audubon to Spencer Fullerton Baird_\r\n\r\n          MINNIESLAND.\r\n          _Nov. 8th, 1846._\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND,\r\n\r\n     We were very happy to hear of your Success in obtaining\r\n     a Professorship. I wish you had been more minute as to\r\n     the amount of your Salary as I consider 400$ as a very\r\n     small sum. If you have not a house, fuel, and furniture,\r\n     &c &c &c to compensate for so small a sum, and having\r\n     so much to perform for it. We are all glad that you have\r\n     a good helpmate in the shape of a wife, and we would be\r\n     very glad to have you under our roof, even now; but as\r\n     the winter is now fast approaching we hope to see you\r\n     certainly some time next spring, or during the summer,\r\n     as you know that then our place is worthy to reside\r\n     at. The fishing is then Capital. The residence of our\r\n     Friend, W. O. Ayers, is on Long Island, and I think that\r\n     a letter addressed to him at Sag-Harbor, will be sure to\r\n     be received by that good Friend of ours.\r\n\r\n     He will be glad to receive the collection of fishes\r\n     which you have procured for him, and I know will be\r\n     most happy to exchange for other fishes or subjects\r\n     if you should desire any at his hands. Please to give\r\n     your Dear Lady our best love, and congratulations on\r\n     her having such a capitally perfect husband. We are all\r\n     well at present. I have not done anything with the Birds\r\n     which, indeed, my son Victor has sent to the Academy of\r\n     Philadelphia. I suppose I need not look any more for a\r\n     Black Fox in the flesh from you during the next winter.\r\n\r\n     Consider me always my Dear Friend,\r\n\r\n          Your most sincerely attached,\r\n\r\n          JOHN J. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n     Should you procure a black fox, be sure to forward him\r\n     uncut to our office New York 78 John Street. Adieu, and\r\n     God bless both you and your Dear Wife.\r\n\r\n     This is a mistake, I brought them back, V. G. A.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The letter press will be ready in a few days. I will\r\n     forward a Copy to you to Philada. from whence you can\r\n     no doubt easily get it. I will join my Father, dear Mr.\r\n     Baird, in congratulations, and in sincere wishes for\r\n     your happiness & welfare.\r\n\r\n          Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n          V. G. AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nVictor Audubon's gift of the volume was acknowledged by Baird on\r\nJanuary 19, 1847, when he said:\r\n\r\n     I have been trying for some time past to find time for\r\n     writing and thanking you for the copy of the Viviparous\r\n     text. Never had mortal man such a feast as I in turning\r\n     over the pages and reading the interesting and copious\r\n     accounts of the habits of animals, many of which\r\n     were unknown to me beyond the name. I was exceedingly\r\n     gratified by the kind terms I found myself mentioned\r\n     throughout the book, more so than I deserve. Be assured\r\n     that no effort of mine however humble shall be spared\r\n     to assist in the perfecting a labor so stupendous and\r\n     important as that in which you are engaged. Would that I\r\n     could be of more substantial aid by sending half a dozen\r\n     subscribers, I may do so yet, who knows.\r\n\r\nThere was soon another matter of vital importance which Baird wished to\r\nannounce to his friend, and, on February 8, he wrote Audubon:\r\n\r\n     Very much to my astonishment I received last Saturday\r\n     a letter from Mr. Dana saying that he had written to\r\n     Dr. Pickering that I would make a good curator of the\r\n     Smithsonian institute, and advising me if I wished\r\n     the place to write immediately to Prof. Henry and\r\n     enclose my credentials. Now I would like the situation\r\n     amazingly and write to ask you to make out a flaming\r\n     recommendation for the place & send me as soon as\r\n     possible. Say what you please about qualification &c. I\r\n     would be obliged to you for the exertion of any personal\r\n     influence you may have on the board of Regents. When\r\n     there I would hope to be materially useful to you in\r\n     your labors.\r\n\r\nThis was followed, on February 11, by a cordial letter from Audubon, in\r\nwhich he said:\r\n\r\n     I am quite convinced myself that no one can easily be\r\n     found so well adapted for such a trust as yourself\r\n     and if my testimoney as to your knowledge and high\r\n     character and industry, and your zeal in seeking a\r\n     perfect acquaintance with the various branches of\r\n     Natural History, and all the scientific and literary\r\n     pursuits which have heretofore occupied you, may be of\r\n     any service, please present this note to the Honorable\r\n     Board of Regents, who I trust will receive it as an\r\n     evidence of my ardent desire for your success, the more\r\n     readily as I have the honor, I think, of knowing some of\r\n     the Board personally.\r\n\r\nSpencer Fullerton Baird's subsequent career, following his appointment\r\nas Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in July, 1850,\r\nas successor to Professor Henry, its first Secretary, as the organizer\r\nof the United States National Museum and the Fish Commission, now the\r\nBureau of Fisheries, as one of the ablest students of birds and fishes\r\nwhich the country has ever produced, as well as the friend of science\r\nand scientific men everywhere, is now well known, and has been ably set\r\nforth by his most recent biographer.[216]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JOHN W. AUDUBON'S INSCRIPTION IN A COPY OF VOLUME I\r\n    OF THE TEXT OF THE \"QUADRUPEDS\" (ENGLISH EDITION) PRESENTED TO JOHN\r\n    E. GRAY.]\r\n\r\nJohn W. Audubon spent the winter of 1846-47 in London, where he was\r\nengaged in painting subjects for his father's work on the _Quadrupeds_.\r\nWhile he was there, arrangements were made for the publication in\r\nthat city of the first volume of the letterpress; this appeared in\r\nMay, 1847,[217] closely following the American edition of the previous\r\nyear, and it was the only European issue of the text of that work. At\r\nthis time also John Audubon made the acquaintance of the distinguished\r\nzoölogist, John Edward Gray, then in charge of the great collections\r\nwhich were being brought together under his direction at the British\r\nMuseum. Gray was asked to furnish descriptions of the animals which\r\nthe younger Audubon had painted, but, as will appear from the following\r\nletter, he declined:[218]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    AFTER THE ENGRAVING BY NORDHEIM OF A DAGUERREOTYPE MADE BY BRADY,\r\n    IN NEW YORK, ABOUT 1848.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    AFTER HIS LAST PORTRAIT, A DAGUERREOTYPE MADE IN NEW YORK ABOUT\r\n    1850.

MUSEUM\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR\r\n\r\n     I am very sorry that I am so occupied that I cannot\r\n     undertake to furnish you with the descriptions of the\r\n     American Mammalia which you have figured here but I\r\n     think you will find that Dr Richardsons descriptions are\r\n     so accurate and detailed that you had better copy them\r\n     for the work than have more imperfect descriptions by a\r\n     less experienced and minute describer.\r\n\r\n     at the same time should Dr Bachman on composing the Work\r\n     want any note or the distinction between any two species\r\n     or the description of any one wh have not contained in\r\n     Richardson Work & he will write to me I shall have great\r\n     pleasure in immediately replying to his request—\r\n\r\n     Wishing you and your family a pleasant voyage believe me\r\n\r\n          Yours truly\r\n\r\n          J. E. GRAY\r\n\r\nBachman was married in 1849 to Maria Martin,[219] his former wife's\r\nsister, who had aided Audubon in drawing the accessories of his\r\nlarge plates. While engaged upon the _Quadrupeds_, he wrote to Victor\r\nAudubon, from Madison Springs, Georgia, on June 30 of that year, as\r\nfollows:[220]\r\n\r\n     I began working four hours a day, now I can work for\r\n     twelve. I shall lessen the hours, should I find my\r\n     strength failing. This is my tenth working-day. I\r\n     have finished seventeen articles, and arranged notes\r\n     for another. I have used as many of your notes as I\r\n     could. Maria copies carefully. She lops off to the\r\n     right and the left with your notes and mine: she\r\n     corrects, criticizes, abuses, and praises us by turns.\r\n     Your father's notes, copied from his journal, are\r\n     valuable—they contain real information; some of the\r\n     others are humbug and rigmarole; but you have done so\r\n     well as to surprise us....\r\n\r\n     I hope that if nothing untoward happens, the Second\r\n     Volume will be finished in a month, and the Third Volume\r\n     next winter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LETTER OF JOHN BACHMAN, NOVEMBER 7, 1846, ADDRESSED TO\r\n    MR. GEORGE OATES, CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n    From the Jeanes MSS.]\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years later, when Victor Audubon's sister-in-law[221]\r\nwas making a disposition of his literary effects, a bundle of\r\nmanuscripts was saved and given to Mr. George Bird Grinnell. Included\r\nin it were a number of Audubon's letters, which are now reproduced,\r\nas well as a considerable section of the printer's copy of _The\r\nViviparous Quadrupeds of North America_, Volume I; this was in various\r\nhandwritings, including little of Bachman's himself, much of Victor's\r\nand of John G. Bell's; a little of this copy also was made by the\r\nsecond Mrs. Bachman and by other and unknown hands, possibly those\r\nof one of Bachman's daughters and of his son-in-law, Reverend John\r\nHaskell, all of whom are known to have assisted in this labor.\r\n\r\nWhen we recall the disadvantages under which John Bachman worked, it\r\nmust be acknowledged that he was deserving of all the credit which\r\nhe received. Born of Swiss and German stock at Rheinbeck, New York,\r\nin 1790, he clearly remembered walking in the mock funeral procession\r\nthat was held in his village when the country was mourning the death\r\nof Washington in 1799. From early boyhood he was an ardent enthusiast\r\nin the study of nature, at a time when such studies were generally\r\nfrowned upon in country districts as not only idle but positively\r\nharmful. He trapped the beaver, and from the sale of its skins was\r\nable to make his first purchase of books on natural history. While a\r\nyoung man he became acquainted with Alexander Wilson and learned to\r\nknow him well, having joined him in field excursions and collected\r\nbirds for him in northern New York; on Wilson's recommendation he\r\nsucceeded both him and his nephew, William Duncan, in the Elwood\r\nSchool, at Milestown, Pennsylvania, where he taught for a year. While\r\nthere, a youth of barely fifteen, he was invited, no doubt through\r\nthe influence of Wilson, to meet Alexander von Humboldt at a dinner\r\ngiven in honor of the great traveler at Philadelphia in 1804. From a\r\npastorate in Shagticoke, New York, Bachman in 1815 went to Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, where he presided over the Lutheran church for nearly\r\nsixty years, and became thoroughly identified with the South. Beloved\r\nas few men ever are in their community, he was widely honored for his\r\nattainments in natural science.\r\n\r\nIn an address on Humboldt, dictated by Bachman when in his eightieth\r\nyear, and too feeble to deliver it himself, he alluded to the event\r\nnoticed above to show \"how scanty, in those days, was the material in\r\nnatural science.\" Among the few naturalists who were present on the\r\noccasion of the dinner, which was held in Peale's Museum, were, he\r\nsaid:[222]\r\n\r\n     the two Bartrams, Wilson, the ornithologist, Lawson,\r\n     his engraver, George Ord and a few others.... Few\r\n     speeches were made and those were short—there was no\r\n     formality.... Humboldt was then, as he was afterwards,\r\n     in every society, \"the observed of all observers\"....\r\n     I saw him every day during the few days he remained in\r\n     Philadelphia. He inserted my name in his note-book,\r\n     and for the last sixty years we corresponded at long\r\n     intervals.... It would be very gratifying to me, and\r\n     interesting to your societies, if I could have exhibited\r\n     to you his autograph in some of his letters; but, alas!\r\n     my whole library and all my collections in Natural\r\n     History, the accumulation of the labors of a long life,\r\n     were burnt by Sherman's vandal army, and, with the\r\n     exception of a single letter, which, by accident, fell\r\n     into the hands of another member of my family, I possess\r\n     no memorials of one who condescended to speak of me as\r\n     a friend.\r\n\r\nAs we have noticed, Audubon's large illustrations of the _Quadrupeds_\r\nwere completed in 1846; this marked the ebb tide of his powers,\r\nand his son, John, who had painted nearly one-half of the originals\r\nof the large plates, like Victor, continued to aid Bachman in the\r\nprosecution of that work. The first number of this lithographic series\r\nwas introduced by the common American wildcat, or _Lynx rufus_, in\r\nthree-quarters natural size, followed by the proverbial ground hog,\r\n\"Maryland marmot,\" or woodchuck, shown in both young and adult state,\r\nin the size of life. Plate No. 4 reproduced an exquisite drawing\r\nof four Florida rats climbing over a pine branch. Some of the elder\r\nAudubon's plates of squirrels are particularly fine and recall the best\r\nof his more famous bird pictures; the gray fox (No. 3, Plate xxi) is\r\nsniffing at a feather blown from a farmer's yard; in another drawing\r\na rascally old black rat and its three young ones are robbing a hen's\r\nnest and breaking up the eggs; Hudson Bay squirrels reach after hazel\r\nnuts which hang in clusters from green boughs above; opossums, with\r\nsardonic grin, are making for the ripe, orange fruits of the persimmon,\r\nholding to the branch with their rat-like, coiled tails; the swift fox\r\n(_Vulpes velox_) sits on the ground, barking like a dog, with head\r\nup-turned, while the better known red fox (No. 18, Plate lxxxvii)\r\nstruggles in an old-fashioned steel trap, the toothed jaws of which\r\nhave gripped a paw above the heel, and you observe that his tail is\r\nwhere, in the circumstances, it is bound to be—between his legs. While\r\nmany of these plates are of the highest degree of excellence, the\r\ncolors are apt to be too vivid and the execution is far from uniform.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUDUBON'S LAST (?) LETTER TO EDWARD\r\n    HARRIS, FEBRUARY 22, 1847.\r\n\r\n    From the Jeanes MSS.]\r\n\r\nThomas M. Brewer, a valued friend and correspondent,[223] in response\r\nto an urgent request, \"ere it be too late,\" paid a visit to the famous\r\nnaturalist on the Fourth of July, 1846, of which he has given this\r\nrecord:[224]\r\n\r\n     I found him in a retreat well worthy of so true a lover\r\n     of nature. It was a lovely spot, on a well-wooded point\r\n     running out in the river. His dwelling was a large\r\n     old-fashioned wooden house, from the veranda of which\r\n     was a fine view, looking both up and down the stream,\r\n     and around the dwelling were grouped several fine old\r\n     forest trees of beech and oak. The grounds were well\r\n     stocked with pets of various kinds, both birds and\r\n     beasts, while his wild feathered favorites, hardly\r\n     less confiding, had their nests over his very doorway.\r\n     Through the grounds ran a small rivulet, over which was\r\n     a picturesque rural bridge.\r\n\r\n     The patriarch ... had greatly changed since I had last\r\n     seen him. He wore his hair longer, and it now hung in\r\n     locks of snowy whiteness over his shoulders. His once\r\n     piercing gray eyes, though still bright, had already\r\n     begun to fail him. He could no longer paint with his\r\n     wonted accuracy, and had at last, most reluctantly, been\r\n     forced to surrender to his sons the task of completing\r\n     his Quadrupeds of North America. Surrounded by his\r\n     large family, including his devoted wife, his two\r\n     sons, and their wives, his enjoyment of life seemed to\r\n     leave little to him to desire. He was very fond of the\r\n     rising generation, and they were as devoted in their\r\n     affectionate regards for him. He seemed to enjoy to the\r\n     utmost each moment of time, content at last to submit\r\n     to an inevitable and well earned leisure, and to throw\r\n     upon his gifted sons his uncompleted tasks. A pleasanter\r\n     scene or a more interesting household it has never been\r\n     the writer's good fortune to witness.\r\n\r\nAudubon's last (?) letter to Edward Harris, here reproduced, is dated\r\nat \"Minnie's Land, Feby 22, 1847,\" and refers to the letterpress\r\nof the _Quadrupeds_. His last published letter to Baird, in which\r\nhe recommended him to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution,[225] was written at \"Minnie's Land, Feb. 11, 1847.\"\r\nIn Spencer F. Baird's last published letter[226] to him, dated at\r\n\"Carlisle April 24, 1847,\" he refers to \"a fine specimen living of a\r\nRed Fox,\" and added: \"If you want him let me know _immediately_ and I\r\nwill send him on _immediately_.\" On July 16 of that year Baird entered\r\nthis note in his diary:[227] \"Went to Mr. Audubon's by stage. Found him\r\nmuch changed.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Audubon never became blind, as has been erroneously stated,\r\nit troubled him to use glasses, and when from failing powers he\r\ncould no longer paint, his heart seemed broken. Like Jonathan Swift,\r\nwho compared his own case with that of the proud forest tree whose\r\nwithering top showed to every passerby the first sign of decrepitude,\r\nso the mind of Audubon gave way before his splendid physique utterly\r\nbroke down.\r\n\r\nBachman, who visited his old friend in the spring of 1848, has given\r\nthis picture of the naturalist's household in a letter[228] from\r\n\"Minnie's Land, May 11, 1848\":\r\n\r\n     I found all well here, as far as health is concerned.\r\n     Mrs. Audubon is straight as an arrow, and in fine\r\n     health, but sadly worried. John has just come in from\r\n     feeding his dogs. Audubon has heard his little song sung\r\n     in French, and has gone to bed. Alas, my poor friend,\r\n     Audubon, the outlines of his countenance and his form\r\n     are there, but his noble mind is all in ruins.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written by Victor Audubon to his\r\nfather-in-law, John Bachman, before February 8, 1849, when his brother\r\nstarted on the ill-fated expedition to which he refers:\r\n\r\n     My brother will leave in a few days for California, he\r\n     will be absent, perhaps for eighteen months.\r\n\r\n     This journey is undertaken with the hope that he may\r\n     be able to get gold. What may be the result, God only\r\n     knows. John will be accompanied by Col. H. L. Webb,\r\n     as military leader; the party consists of about eighty\r\n     picked men. One of Dr. Mayer's sons wished to go with\r\n     John, but unluckily, his application came after the\r\n     party was made up, so they could not take him.\r\n\r\n     I should like much to see you all, but now it will be\r\n     impossible for me to go so far from home.\r\n\r\n     My dear old father is apparently comfortable, and enjoys\r\n     his little notions; but requires constant care and\r\n     attendance; the rest are well. Your granddaughters are\r\n     growing finely, and are well educated; soon we shall\r\n     call in a \"_Maitre de danse_,\" to polish them up and\r\n     _improve their understanding_.\r\n\r\n     I am just about to start for Washington, to get letters\r\n     from the President for John and I will try and see the\r\n     collection brought back by the exploring expedition,\r\n     including the famous Black-tail Deer. I am in a great\r\n     bustle, the office is full of Californians.\r\n\r\nThe California party, which eventually consisted of nearly one hundred\r\nyoung men, sought to reach the goldfields by way of Texas, Mexico\r\nand Arizona; attacked by cholera in the valley of the Rio Grande and\r\ndeserted by their leader, a remnant of the company chose in his stead\r\nyoung Audubon, who bravely conducted them to their destination. John\r\nAudubon returned in the following year, after thirteen of the members\r\nof the party and $27,000 had been lost in the venture.\r\n\r\nLike a patriarch of old, as a friend had once pictured him, Audubon\r\npassed the end of his days surrounded by loving and able retainers,\r\nwho, like \"ministers of state,\" were only too glad to execute his\r\nevery wish. Distinguished and handsome in age, appearing to many older\r\nthan he actually was, for years his snowy locks and benign countenance\r\nattracted every passer on the street, and for each he had a friendly\r\nlook, word, or greeting, until in him were fulfilled the words of the\r\nPsalmist: \"When thou art young thou goest whither thou willest, but\r\nwhen thou art old another shall lead thee, and thou shalt go whither\r\nthou willest not.\" On the 27th of January, 1851, Jean Jacques Fougère\r\nAudubon died, before attaining his sixty-seventh year, \"as gently as a\r\nchild composing himself for his beautiful sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nAFTERWORD: AUDUBON'S FAMILY IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n     Bachman completes his text on the _Quadrupeds_—Victor\r\n     Audubon's success in canvassing—John Woodhouse\r\n     Audubon's family—New houses at \"Minnie's Land\"—Second\r\n     octavo edition of the _Birds_—Victor Audubon's illness\r\n     and death—Attempt to reissue _The Birds of America_\r\n     in America—The residual stock of this imperfect\r\n     edition—Death of John Woodhouse Audubon—His career\r\n     and work as an artist and field collector—Mrs. Audubon\r\n     resumes her old vocation—Fate of \"Minnie's Land\"—Death\r\n     of Mrs. Audubon—Her share in her husband's fame—Story\r\n     written on Audubon's original drawings—Fate of the\r\n     original copper plates of the _Birds_—A boy comes to the\r\n     rescue—\"Minnie's Land\" today—The \"Cave\"—A real \"Audubon\r\n     Park.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the elder Audubon, his sons, under the leadership\r\nof Bachman, continued the work on the _Quadrupeds_ until the third and\r\nlast volume of the letterpress was completed in 1852. On March 13 of\r\nthat year Bachman wrote to Edward Harris:[229]\r\n\r\n     Rejoice with me, the book is finished. I did not expect\r\n     to have lived to complete it. But Victor Audubon came\r\n     on, and I made him hold the pen, while I dictated with\r\n     specimens and books before me, and we went on rapidly;\r\n     we worked hard, and now we are at the end of our labors.\r\n     I have, at last, prevailed on them to give the Bats. At\r\n     the end of the work, I intend to give a synopsis and\r\n     scientific arrangement of all our American species,\r\n     including seals, whales and porpoises. This will be\r\n     included in the letter-press of the Third Volume.\r\n\r\n     Here I will venture to consult you in regard to the\r\n     publication of additional plates of species, not figured\r\n     in the Large Work. A very small Arvicola and Shrews, we\r\n     may not obtain, and they cannot be figured; but nearly\r\n     all are within our reach. Some of the subscribers have\r\n     bound up their plates, and there cannot be a sufficient\r\n     number to make even half of another Volume. I propose,\r\n     as all these figures will be contained in the _Small\r\n     Work_, that they should be inserted in the letter-press\r\n     of the _Large Work_, so that subscribers, by merely\r\n     paying the cost of the small plates, would have the work\r\n     complete—what do you think of this?\r\n\r\n     What do you think of Victor's obtaining one hundred and\r\n     twenty-nine subscribers in about three days, and I think\r\n     he will double the number, next week; so, if the \"Large\r\n     Work\" will not pay, the \"Small\" one, and this is large\r\n     enough, is sure to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen Victor was canvassing the South for the second or composite\r\nedition of this work, Bachman wrote to a friend in Savannah, on March\r\n25, 1852:[230]\r\n\r\n     My son-in-law, Victor G. Audubon, is on a rapid visit to\r\n     the South, and has a week or two to spare, which he is\r\n     desirous of devoting to the obtaining of subscribers to\r\n     the \"American Quadrupeds.\" The Work (Miniature) will be\r\n     complete in about thirty numbers, furnished monthly at\r\n     $1.00 per number.\r\n\r\n     The figures were made by the Audubons, and the\r\n     descriptions and letter-press were prepared by myself.\r\n\r\n     I have no pecuniary interest in this work, as I have\r\n     cheerfully given my own labors without any other reward\r\n     than the hope of having contributed something toward\r\n     the advancement of the cause of Natural History in\r\n     our country. I am, however, anxious that the Audubons\r\n     should, by a liberal subscription, receive some\r\n     remuneration for the labors and heavy expenses incurred\r\n     in getting up this work. Of the character of the work it\r\n     does not become me to say much. I will only add that in\r\n     my department is summed up the result of investigations\r\n     pursued through a long life, and, I think, the figures\r\n     have never been equalled in any publication either in\r\n     Europe or America.\r\n\r\n     May I bespeak from you a little aid to my esteemed\r\n     son-in-law, Mr. Audubon, in assisting him to procure\r\n     subscribers. He is a stranger in your city; his time\r\n     is limited, and his stay among you will necessarily be\r\n     short.\r\n\r\n     By the aid of two friends here, he obtained two hundred\r\n     and fifty subscribers in a few days.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April Bachman wrote to his son-in-law: \"Will you not\r\nreturn to New York by the way of Charleston and sail from here, take a\r\nmanuscript volume in your pocket, and four hundred good and true names\r\non your list?\"\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded to the illustrations and text of this work had\r\nencouraged the brothers to do for the _Quadrupeds_ what their father,\r\nwith their aid, had so successfully accomplished for the _Birds_, by\r\npresenting text and plates, as Bachman said, in \"Miniature.\" In this\r\nthey succeeded as admirably as before, John reducing all the large\r\nplates, by the aid of the camera lucida, for the octavo edition which\r\nwas published in 1854.\r\n\r\nThe following historical evidence of the appreciation which Audubon's\r\nworks have received at the hands of the National Government I owe\r\nto Mr. Ruthven Deane, to whom the reader of these pages is already\r\nindebted for many illuminating facts. Dr. Theodore S. Palmer was\r\nrecently inspecting governmental records at Washington, when he\r\naccidentally came upon the following entry:\r\n\r\n     Chap. CXXIX.—An act making appropriations for certain\r\n     Civil Expenses of the Government for the Year ending the\r\n     thirtieth of June, eighteen hundred and fifty-seven.\r\n\r\n     To enable the Secretary of State to purchase one hundred\r\n     copies, each, of Audubon's \"Birds of America\" and\r\n     \"Quadrupeds of America,\" for presentation to foreign\r\n     governments, in return for valuable works sent by them\r\n     to the Government of the United States, sixteen thousand\r\n     dollars.\r\n\r\n     [Act of August 18, 1858 (LL State., 90).]\r\n\r\nIn John Woodhouse Audubon's family there were two sets of children,\r\ntwo by his former wife, Maria R. Bachman, and seven by Caroline Hall,\r\nto whom he was married on October 2, 1841. Victor Gifford Audubon, who\r\nhad no children by his first wife, May Eliza Bachman, was married on\r\nMarch 2, 1843, to Georgiana Richards Mallory, an Englishwoman, and six\r\nchildren were born to them between 1845 and 1854. Of the naturalist's\r\nfifteen grandchildren, six are believed to be now living (1917).[231]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOUSE FORMERLY BELONGING TO VICTOR GIFFORD AUDUBON,\r\n    EAST FRONT, AS IT APPEARS TO-DAY; MRS. JOHN JAMES AUDUBON KEPT HER\r\n    PRIVATE SCHOOL IN THE CORNER ROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOUSE FORMERLY BELONGING TO JOHN WOODHOUSE AUDUBON,\r\n    SOUTH FRONT, AS IT APPEARS TO-DAY; AT THE RIGHT IS \"THE CAVE,\"\r\n    WHERE THE COPPER PLATES OF \"THE BIRDS OF AMERICA\" WERE STORED.]\r\n\r\nIn 1852-3 Audubon's sons built houses for their growing families on\r\ntheir mother's estate; Victor's was placed just north of the original\r\nhomestead, and John's not far away. On the slope behind John Audubon's\r\nhouse, a small building, later known as the \"Cave,\" was specially\r\nconstructed for the safer keeping of the famous copper plates, which\r\nhad already passed through fire,[232] and not wholly unscathed. Mr.\r\nJohn Hardin, now (1915) a serene and clear-eyed man of eighty-four,\r\nwho settled in that neighborhood in 1852 and who was intermittently\r\nemployed by the younger Audubons for a decade, has told me that he\r\nboxed with his own hands all of the copper plates, after wrapping\r\neach in tissue paper, and stored them in that building; whenever John\r\nAudubon wanted a plate, John Hardin would go to the \"Cave\" and get it\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Victor Audubon published a second reduced edition of his\r\nfather's _Birds of America_, in which the text and plates of the first\r\noctavo were reproduced with little or no change. At about that time\r\nVictor suffered an injury to the spine,[233] and after 1857 he was\r\ncompletely invalided; he died in his own home, August 18, 1860.\r\n\r\nTo quote the daughter of John W. Audubon:[234]\r\n\r\n     During this long period of my uncle's illness all the\r\n     care of both families devolved on my father. Never a\r\n     \"business man,\" saddened by his brother's condition,\r\n     and utterly unable to manage, at the same time, a fairly\r\n     large estate, the publication of two illustrated works,\r\n     every plate of which he felt he must personally examine,\r\n     the securing of subscribers and the financial condition\r\n     of everything—what wonder that he rapidly aged, what\r\n     wonder that the burden was overwhelming! After my\r\n     uncle's death matters became still more difficult to\r\n     handle, owing to the unsettled condition of the southern\r\n     states where most of the subscribers to Audubon's\r\n     books resided, and when the open rupture came between\r\n     north and south, the condition of affairs can hardly\r\n     be imagined, except by those who lived through similar\r\n     bitter and painful experiences.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 or 1859 John W. Audubon entered upon an ambitious project,\r\nwhich the outbreak of the Civil War, aided, it is believed, by the\r\nunscrupulous dealings of business partners, rendered disastrous.\r\nIn association with Messrs. Roe Lockwood, & Son, New York, and the\r\nlithographers, Messrs. J. Bien & Company, Number 180 Broadway, with\r\nwhom considerable money had been invested, a second and American\r\nedition of his father's great folio on _The Birds of America_ was\r\nattempted. An atlas of 106 double elephant plates, reproduced in colors\r\non stone with slight but numerous changes from the original copper\r\nplates, was completed as Volume I in 1860;[235] the war, which broke\r\nimmediately afterwards, completely ruined the enterprise, so that but\r\nfew copies of the work were dispersed and an immense stock of plates\r\nwas rendered useless; the burden of debt was undoubtedly increased by\r\nthe issue of seven octavo volumes of text.[236]\r\n\r\nMany years later, hundreds of persons who knew of Audubon's work only\r\nthrough its great reputation, and who had never learned to discriminate\r\nbetween a hand-colored copper-plate engraving and a lithograph, were\r\ndeceived by an adroit, but essentially spurious advertisement of these\r\ninferior reproductions when they were being exploited by a firm of\r\nBoston book dealers. The original bulk of these large lithographs must\r\nhave been vast indeed, if the following story, which was attributed\r\nto a member of the firm in question, be true: \"We bought the entire\r\nstock of those plates, many years ago,\" so this man is reported to have\r\nsaid, \"and, though the sales of every succeeding year since have been\r\nsufficient to cover the original cost, the number of plates has not\r\nappreciably diminished.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this larger venture failed, one of the publishers, who was not\r\nsatisfied with the surplusage of books and plates left on his hands,\r\nis said to have placed encumbrances upon the Audubon estate. At\r\nabout this time John W. Audubon's health broke down; \"Worn out,\" as\r\nhis daughter has said,[237] \"in body and spirit, overburdened with\r\nanxieties, saddened by the condition of his country, it is no matter of\r\nsurprise that my father could not throw off a heavy cold which attacked\r\nhim early in 1862.\" He died at the age of forty-nine, on the 18th of\r\nFebruary of that year.\r\n\r\nJohn Woodhouse Audubon, like his brother, Victor, had inherited decided\r\nartistic abilities, and from a youth had been his father's assistant,\r\nfield companion and friend. Victor Audubon, on the other hand, was\r\nnever a field collector, but aided his father more in a financial and\r\nsecretarial capacity. Both in adult life were fond of music and good\r\ncheer, and at one time John was probably as devoted to adventure and\r\nsport as his father had ever been in his palmiest days. One of his\r\nyouthful pranks is thus guardedly referred to by the senior Audubon\r\nwhen writing at American Harbor, on the coast of Labrador, June 25,\r\n1833:[238] \"The young men, who are always ready for sport, caught a\r\nhundred codfish in half an hour, and _somewhere_ secured three fine\r\nsalmon, one of which was sent to the 'Gulnare' with some cod.\" Whether\r\nthe fishermen at American Harbor, who had obstinately refused to sell,\r\never missed those fine salmon from their pounds, is not recorded.\r\nAnother adventure has been related by Mr. Fraser,[239] whose family was\r\non intimate terms with the Audubons and MacGillivrays at Edinburgh,\r\nwhen John Audubon, John MacGillivray (William MacGillivray's eldest\r\nson), and himself were caught in the Ravelston woods while shooting\r\nbirds; the boys, he said \"were rather roughly handled,\" but got off by\r\ngiving up their guns.\r\n\r\nUnder his father's tuition John Audubon became an observant and\r\nself-reliant collector in the field, and an animal painter and\r\ndraughtsman of no mean powers. At twenty-one, as we have seen, he\r\naccompanied his father's expedition to Labrador, was with him and\r\nHarris in Florida and Texas in 1837, made successive visits to England,\r\nand traveled again in Texas and in Mexico, all in the interests of his\r\nfather's works. He painted nearly one-half of the large plates of the\r\n_Quadrupeds of North America_, besides reducing all the drawings for\r\nthe smaller editions of the _Birds_ and _Quadrupeds_, an enormous labor\r\nin itself, representing the redrawing, with numerous alterations, of\r\n655 elaborate octavo plates. After his return from California in 1850,\r\nhe began to bring out an account of his western travels, —projected\r\nfor ten monthly numbers, but this never advanced beyond the first\r\npart.[240]\r\n\r\nIf not a \"business man\" by instinct or training, John Audubon\r\nin emergencies could turn his hand to many things. For a time he\r\nsuperintended the building of houses, including his own and Victor's,\r\nwhich were completed in 1853, as well as another that was built on\r\nthe Audubon estate for Mr. Hall, a brother-in-law; he also took charge\r\nof lighting the streets, and at another time was superintendent of a\r\nquarry in Vermont. \"He was a bluff, gruff, but friendly man,\" writes\r\nGeorge Bird Grinnell,[241] and was always willing to talk about\r\nbirds, mammals, or, indeed, any natural history object, to any boy\r\nwho asked him questions.\" On the other hand, an ardent sportsman,\r\nwho had lived with the family for years,[242] has described him as a\r\nlovable companion, \"genial in speech, full of anecdote, and a capital\r\nconversationalist;... in person of more than median height, and of\r\ncommanding appearance, his face told plainly of the humanity of the\r\nman; he was as tender-hearted as a girl, and his expressive voice could\r\ncommand any key of which the vocal organs were capable; to the last he\r\nretained the Southern habit of softly clipping the ends of words.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Woodhouse Audubon will be remembered chiefly as his father's aid\r\nand companion, although in his _Western Journal_,[243] written in his\r\nthirty-eighth year but not published until forty-two years after his\r\ndeath, he has left a record of which anyone could be rightfully proud.\r\n\r\nMrs. John James Audubon was very active in body and mind for a long\r\nperiod after her husband's death, and in 1857, when in her seventieth\r\nyear, she returned in a degree to her old vocation of school teaching,\r\nwhich had been so successfully followed in Ohio and Louisiana when her\r\nhusband was on the threshold of his extraordinary career. Her pupils\r\nnow consisted of some of her numerous grandchildren and a few others\r\ndrawn from the neighborhood; among the latter was the well known writer\r\nand father of the original Audubon Society, George Bird Grinnell, who\r\npointed out to me the room in Victor Audubon's old house where his\r\nrevered and venerable teacher had gathered her little flock. \"She loved\r\nto read, to study, and to teach,\" said one who had known her, and \"she\r\nknew how to gain the attention of the young, and to fix knowledge in\r\ntheir minds. 'If I can hold the mind of a child to a subject for five\r\nminutes, he will never forget what I teach him,' she once remarked;\r\nand, acting upon this principle, she was as successful, at three score\r\nand ten years, in imparting knowledge, as she had been in early life\r\nwhen she taught in Louisiana.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Audubon's own house was rented and eventually sold. Meanwhile, it\r\nseems, she lived for a number of years with the family of her eldest\r\nson, and it was at Victor's house, as just noticed, that she started\r\na small school. Finally, in 1863, at the age of seventy-five, bereft\r\nof children and fortune, she left the scenes of her once happy home,\r\nthen \"Minnie's Land\" no longer, and for a considerable period lived\r\nwith a granddaughter at Washington Heights, as that section on the\r\nriver, including Carmansville, came to be called, and a little later\r\nat Manhattanville, a short distance below; there at the home of the\r\nReverend Charles Coffin Adams, who prepared the original draft of the\r\n_Life_ of her husband, the history of which has been given,[244] she\r\npassed a number of years after 1865.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to a relative from \"Washington Heights, N. Y., July\r\n11, 1865,\" Mrs. Audubon spoke thus of the present, while memories, not\r\nuntinged with sorrow, filled the retrospect:\r\n\r\n     We have passed through a very cold winter which tried\r\n     both my Granddaughter ... and myself much. I have hoped\r\n     until I almost despair that [she] would have a short\r\n     Holiday so that we could go up to Hudson for a week\r\n     and see you all and mingle with those who sympathize\r\n     and care for us, but in a Boarding house, one seems\r\n     a stranger in the world, and as I pass my days alone\r\n     generally from breakfast till our dinner hour six\r\n     o'clock evening when [my granddaughter] comes home from\r\n     her music Pupils of whom she has now ten, and from that\r\n     time I am glad when she is invited out to refresh her\r\n     mind.\r\n\r\n     I seldom leave home but to go up to see my other Grand\r\n     Daughter Lucy Williams, but being sixteen miles off we\r\n     do not go there often....\r\n\r\n     I have heard from my Sister Gordon lately of Orleans,\r\n     she has her Son at home! but they are likely to lose\r\n     all their Property on account of Sister's Son having\r\n     been engaged in the Confederate War. It does seem to me\r\n     ... as if we were a doomed family for all of us are in\r\n     pecuniary difficulty more or less. As to myself I find\r\n     it hard to look back patiently upon my great ignorance\r\n     of business and the want of a wise adviser who I now\r\n     find could have saved me half the property I have under\r\n     errour and ignorance sacrificed and have just enough\r\n     left to keep us but not enjoy life by any travelling\r\n     about in this beautiful World. I sat on Sunday night\r\n     after Church on the Piazza, contemplating the beautiful\r\n     Moon & its Creator, and I cannot yet say I wish to\r\n     leave it, notwithstanding all my disappointments and\r\n     mortifications. Excuse this long detail about myself. I\r\n     cannot help looking back as well as to the present and\r\n     future.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Audubon had passed her eightieth year she left New York and\r\nagain made her home in the West. In 1874, when with a granddaughter at\r\nLouisville, she dictated and signed the following letter to a gentleman\r\nwho had asked for an autograph of her husband:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Audubon to William R. Dorlan_\r\n\r\n     LOUISVILLE _Jan. 30 1874_\r\n\r\n     MR. WM. R. DORLAN\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR\r\n\r\n     I regret that your letter of Jan. 10th has remained\r\n     so long unanswered, but my granddaughter who usually\r\n     writes for me, is so constantly occupied with her pupils\r\n     that until to-day she has not been able to find time to\r\n     write to you. I regret that I cannot give you a letter\r\n     of my husband _John James Audubon_ with the autograph\r\n     attached.\r\n\r\n     The enclosed, the best I have to send you is one from\r\n     which the autograph and a portion of the letter were cut\r\n     off many years ago.\r\n\r\n     With many regrets that I cannot more fully grant your\r\n     request\r\n\r\n          I am dear Sir\r\n          Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n          LUCY AUDUBON\r\n\r\nMrs. Audubon's closing days were spent at the home of her\r\nsister-in-law, Mrs. William G. Bakewell, at Shelbyville, Kentucky,\r\nwhere she died, with her mental faculties unimpaired, at the age of\r\neighty-six, June 13, 1874, having outlived this sister-in-law and\r\nher younger sisters, Mrs. Alexander Gordon, of New Orleans, and Mrs.\r\nNicholas Augustus Berthoud, of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nNot long after John W. Audubon's death, his family disposed of\r\ntheir house on what had been the \"Minnie's Land\" estate, and lived\r\nsuccessively at Harlem, New Haven, Connecticut, and Salem, New York,\r\nwhere Mrs. John W. Audubon died, and where her daughter, Maria Rebecca,\r\nthe biographer of her father and grandfather, with a sister, still\r\nresides. Victor Audubon's family, with some of their kinsfolk, remained\r\nat the Hudson River place, which was included in the section known as\r\n\"Audubon Park,\" until May, 1878, when they took a house in New York,\r\nwhere Mrs. Victor Audubon died in 1882.\r\n\r\nA brother of Mrs. Victor Audubon, Mr. E. Mallory, in writing to a\r\nfriend in Buffalo from \"Audubon Park, August 31, 1874,\" said that it\r\nwas a source of deep regret to Mrs. John James Audubon that her last\r\nyears were not passed with them, under the shadow of her old home on\r\nthe Hudson; and he continued: \"She was a kind and good friend, very\r\nintelligent, and much beloved here; I remember her telling a young\r\nlady, who asked her if she had read some fashionable novel, that\r\nshe had no time; 'at my age,' said she, 'I must make the most of my\r\ntime.' As she was a wide reader, it was a great trial when, in age,\r\nher eyesight completely failed her. The minister who pronounced her\r\neulogy[245] said:\r\n\r\n     Many of you can recall that aged form and benignant\r\n     countenance, as she moved along these streets upon\r\n     errands of usefulness and benevolence, with benedictions\r\n     on her tongue, and smiles that were a blessing to all\r\n     who met her.\r\n\r\n     Madame Audubon interested herself in all that pertained\r\n     to the welfare of the neighborhood where she lived.\r\n     Although it was not without a pang that she saw her\r\n     sylvan home invaded by the growth of the city, and all\r\n     old associations broken up, she did not treat those who\r\n     came to live near her as strangers. She had a large\r\n     and generous heart, and with her husband had always\r\n     exercised a liberal hospitality and hearty kindness\r\n     towards all. In prosperity and adversity she was equally\r\n     sincere and humble, a friend of all worthy people....\r\n\r\nMrs. Audubon, during the period of her husband's greatest activity,\r\nhad traveled much and met people distinguished in every walk of life.\r\nIf, as some have thought, when Audubon was struggling for recognition,\r\nhe was somewhat oblivious of the privations which his wife endured, in\r\nthe sunshine of later years, when fame and fortune had smiled upon him,\r\nhe showed by every token of affection how fully he realized his debt.\r\nLet it also be remembered that the monument by which Americans have\r\nsignalized their appreciation of his labors, is honored by the ashes of\r\nhis beloved Lucy, which rest by his side.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LUCY BAKEWELL AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    AFTER AN UNPUBLISHED PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN 1871. PUBLISHED BY\r\n    COURTESY OF MISS FLORENCE AUDUBON.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LUCY BAKEWELL AUDUBON\r\n\r\n    AFTER A MINIATURE PAINTED BY FREDERICK CRUIKSHANK IN LONDON, ABOUT\r\n    1831. PUBLISHED BY COURTESY OF CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS.]\r\n\r\nThe original drawings of the plates of _The Birds of America_ were\r\nsold by Mrs. Audubon on June 2, 1863, to the Historical Society of New\r\nYork,[246] and a few of them are now displayed in its building in that\r\ncity; it is still hoped that a fire-proof and adequately lighted hall\r\ncan be constructed so that the whole of this great series of pictures\r\nmay be exhibited under more perfect conditions. The artistic beauty\r\nand historical value of these drawings, with the added charm which\r\npersonal association has so richly supplied, would render Audubon's\r\n\"Book of Nature\" one of the most unique and interesting exhibits in the\r\nNew World. The collection appears to be nearly complete, although some\r\nnotable pieces, such as the Wild Turkeys, are lacking, but there are\r\nother drawings, and some of early date, which were never reproduced;\r\nall are inclosed in the original portfolios, scarred by hard knocks\r\nand the tooth of time, massive, leather-bound containers, which two\r\nstrong arms would raise with difficulty from the ground. Most of these\r\noriginals are mounted on a gray backing, with plate margins in each\r\ncase indicated by ink lines. As was noticed in an earlier chapter,\r\nmany original legends and notes written by Audubon's pencil or pen\r\nstill remain on the drawings, though many have been trimmed off or\r\nerased; these include names of localities and dates, and directions to\r\nthe engraver for changes in the background and composition or for any\r\nimprovement of the whole or a part.\r\n\r\nAs a further illustration of the care which Audubon exercised over the\r\nminute details of his great undertaking, we will reproduce the penciled\r\norders on the drawing of the Great White Heron (Plate cclxxxi), which\r\nshows an adult male performing the gymnastic feat of seizing a large\r\nstriped fish, a view of Key West forming the background: \"Keep closely\r\nto the sky in depth & colouring! have the water a _Pea-green_ tint.\r\nKeep the division of the scales on the leg in fact white in your\r\nengraving—The colouring over these will subdue them enough! finish the\r\nhouses better from the original which you have; have the upper back\r\nportion very mellowing in the outline.\" Again, on the drawing of the\r\nGreat Cinereous Owl (Plate cccli), we read: \"Raise the bird about 4\r\ninches on the copper—higher than in the Drawing, and put in a landscape\r\nbelow of Wild Mountains,\" a direction which in this instance was not\r\nfollowed, for the bird was eventually shown on a branch against the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nIn many instances towards the end of his work, Audubon furnished Havell\r\nwith drawings of the birds only, with directions to supply \"an old\r\nrotten stick\" for perch, or to \"amend this rascally sky and water\"; as\r\nwe have already seen, he often depended upon him to combine several\r\ndetached pictures into one plate, but not always with happy results.\r\nThe following note was written on a drawing of the Carolina Parrot,\r\nreproduced in a very striking plate (No. xxvi), in which seven gaudy\r\nindividuals of this nearly extinct species are represented feeding on a\r\nfavorite weed, the cockle-bur: \"The upper specimen was shot near Bayou\r\nSarah, and appeared as very uncommon having 14 Tail feathers all very\r\ndistinct—uniformly affixed in 14 distinct receptacles that I drew it\r\nmore to exhibit one of those astonishing fits of nature than anything\r\nelse—it was a female.—The Green headed is also a Singular although not\r\nso uncommon a variety as the above one. Louisiana—December (1821?) J.\r\nJ. Audubon.\" The upper bird, which is here referred to, is noticed in\r\nhis \"Biography\" of the species as \"a kind of occasional variety.\"\r\n\r\nOn the drawing of the Swamp Sparrow (Plate lxiv), which was published\r\nin 1829, Audubon wrote, evidently with the wish of having his wife's\r\nname appear: \"Drawn from Nature by Lucy Audubon, Mr. Havell will please\r\nhave Lucy Audubon name on this plate instead of mine...!\"\r\n\r\nVandalism is always short-sighted, but seldom has its vision been more\r\nmyopic and sinister than in the case of the copper plates of _The Birds\r\nof America_, most of which were sold for old metal and converted into\r\ncopper bars. Had they been preserved to this day, their value would\r\nhave been an hundred-fold greater than that of the few paltry tons of\r\nmetallic copper which they were supposed to represent. Mr. Ruthven\r\nDeane, whose researches in the field of \"Auduboniana\" have added\r\ngreatly to this subject, has given a history of these plates,[247] and\r\nof the interesting way in which a remnant came to be snatched, as it\r\nwere, from the very mouth of the furnace, through the persistence and\r\nenthusiasm of a lad of fourteen. To follow this writer's account, it\r\nseems that shortly after the death of her son John, Mrs. Audubon sold\r\nthe copper plates to a firm in New York, where they remained until\r\nabout 1865, stored in the warehouse of Messrs. Phelps, Dodge & Company.\r\nNot far from that time the plates were sorted and a few were given\r\naway; the large remainder was sent to a brass and copper company, of\r\nwhich William E. Dodge was president, at Ansonia, Connecticut. How some\r\nof these were fortunately rescued, in about the year 1873, is told in\r\na letter to Mr. Deane from Mr. Charles A. Cowles, of Ansonia:\r\n\r\n     At that time I was about fourteen years old. I was\r\n     beginning the study of taxidermy, and was naturally\r\n     deeply interested in birds. I happened to be at the\r\n     refinery watching the process of loading one of the\r\n     furnaces, and noticed on one of the sheets of copper\r\n     that a man was throwing into the furnace, what appeared\r\n     to me to be the picture of a bird's foot. I took the\r\n     plate from him, cleaned it with acid, and thereupon\r\n     discovered the engraving, or as I termed it, the\r\n     picture, of a bird (Plate cvi, Black Vulture), I made\r\n     an immediate but unsuccessful request to the foreman of\r\n     the furnace not to melt the plates; and then I appealed\r\n     to the superintendent, but without avail. I next brought\r\n     the matter to the general manager of the concern, my\r\n     father, from whom I received no encouragement. This\r\n     sort of treatment was evidently what I needed, for\r\n     I hastened back to the works in a state of mind so\r\n     determined that I succeeded in having all the plates,\r\n     that had not been melted, removed to a place of safety.\r\n     This occurred in the spring of that year; and the plates\r\n     remained undisturbed until the annual inventory was\r\n     taken the first of the following year. At that time the\r\n     disposition of the plates was taken up. I appealed to\r\n     my mother and interested her to such an extent that she\r\n     drove to the factory and looked at one of the plates.\r\n     She of course recognized that they were Audubon plates;\r\n     and instructions were given by my father to keep them\r\n     intact. The plates were subsequently submitted to a\r\n     treatment which removed all oxidation and then taken to\r\n     the main office of the company, and to the best of my\r\n     recollection, distributed as follows: Mr. Wm. E. Dodge,\r\n     president of the company, had a few plates sent to the\r\n     American Museum of Natural History, New York City, and a\r\n     few plates to the Smithsonian Institution, Washington,\r\n     D. C., and I think he retained one or two for himself.\r\n     The remainder of them, with the exception of two, my\r\n     father kept; and they have since come into my possession\r\n     by purchase from the estate. The two plates just\r\n     excepted were Nos. xxii and lxxxii [Purple Martin and\r\n     Whippoorwill], and they particularly struck my fancy,\r\n     so much that when the plates were first discovered I\r\n     managed to secure them on the quiet, cleaned them myself\r\n     and hid them; and when the plates were distributed no\r\n     one knew of the existence of these two and they later\r\n     became my property.\r\n\r\nIt was thought possible that some of these plates had been sold in New\r\nYork City before the bulk of them were condemned as junk and sent to\r\nConnecticut, but in 1898 Mr. Deane was able to give the designation\r\nand resting place of only thirty-seven;[248] among these, however, were\r\nthe Wild Turkeys, Canada Goose, Great Northern Diver, Raven, American\r\nRobin, and Ruby-throated Hummingbird, all among the finest of the\r\noriginal 435.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of Mr. George Bird Grinnell, on April 6, 1916, I\r\npaid a visit to \"Audubon Park,\" now \"Minnie's Land\" no longer, where\r\ncountry roads have given way to business streets and forests to subways\r\nand skyscraper apartment houses. Notwithstanding the momentous changes\r\nwhich the extension of upper New York City has effected both above\r\nand below ground during the recent era of rapid transportation, the\r\nold Audubon houses still remain, like boulders amid stream, the impact\r\nof the city which has flowed around and beyond them being checked for\r\nthe moment by a rampart of solid masonry, the retaining wall of the\r\nfar-famed Riverside Drive, which rises above Audubon's old house close\r\nto its rear veranda and there makes a wide turn. For Mr. Grinnell this\r\nwas a return to the scenes of his boyhood; the home of his father,\r\nMr. George Blake Grinnell, stood on the hill just above the Audubon\r\nhouse, not far from the present \"Riviera\" building at One Hundred and\r\nFifty-Seventh Street; the Grinnell apartment house which towers aloft\r\nclose at hand stands in their old cow pasture, while their garden site\r\nis marked by the present entrance to the subway station on Broadway.\r\n\r\nThe first part of Audubon's original tract to be sold was the easterly\r\nsection, extending from what is now the east side of Broadway to the\r\nBloomingdale Road, and between the present One Hundred and Fifty-sixth\r\nand One Hundred and Fifty-seventh Streets; on that portion John\r\nWoodhouse Audubon built a large frame structure which, for a number\r\nof years, served as a boarding house for workmen employed in the sugar\r\nrefinery of Messrs. Plume & Lamont that stood on the river-bank, at the\r\nfoot of the present One Hundred and Sixtieth Street. Victor and John\r\nW. Audubon also built three houses on the hill, one of which, between\r\nOne Hundred and Fifty-sixth and One Hundred and Fifty-seventh Streets,\r\nwas occupied by Mr. Grinnell; another, at one time the dwelling of\r\nHenry A. Smythe, a former Collector of the Port of New York, was on\r\nland now covered by the Numismatic Building, while a third, which was\r\noccupied by Wellington Clapp, was on a part of the Archer M. Huntington\r\nestate, south of One Hundred and Fifty-sixth Street, and stood a little\r\neasterly of the present Riverside Drive; all of these houses have\r\ndisappeared. In September, 1842, the Corporation of Trinity Parish\r\nacquired from Richard F. Carman, in Carmansville, the tract of land\r\nlater known as \"Trinity Cemetery\"; this extended from Bloomingdale Road\r\nto the River, and between the present One Hundred and Fifty-third and\r\nOne Hundred and Fifty-fifth Streets.[249]\r\n\r\nThe original Audubon house, standing in the angle nearly opposite One\r\nHundred and Fifty-fifth Street, is all but concealed, except from the\r\nriver side, but may be approached by a lane which leads off from One\r\nHundred and Fifty-eighth Street. In 1913, when this old landmark was\r\nin imminent danger of demolition, the Commissioner of Public Parks\r\nmade an eloquent plea for its preservation to the Audubon Societies\r\nand to lovers of birds and nature everywhere. It was then suggested\r\nthat instead of permitting the historic structure to be destroyed,\r\nthe city should acquire it, float it up the Hudson River to Fort\r\nWashington Park, and re-establish it there as a permanent memorial\r\nto the naturalist; it was also noticed that the public interest was\r\nenhanced by the fact that the father of telegraphy, Samuel F. B. Morse,\r\nhad worked upon his invention while Audubon's guest, and that the first\r\nmessage to be received from Philadelphia came over a wire which entered\r\nhis room at the northwest corner of the building.\r\n\r\nAn early engraving[250] represents the naturalist's house essentially\r\nas it appeared during his lifetime, surrounded by goodly forest trees\r\nof oak and chestnut, but these, when standing at all, are now reduced\r\nto gaunt and scarred remnants. A later print[251] shows the three\r\nAudubon houses, the river, and between it and the lawn \"that eye-sore\r\nof a railroad,\"[252] which was built not long after Audubon settled\r\nupon his estate. The original house was sold before 1862,[253] and\r\nabout eight years later its new owner occupied it, after having given\r\nit a mansard roof and made numerous changes which were sanctioned\r\nby an era of bad taste. The naturalist's house overlooked the river\r\nand commanded a grand view from its high veranda on the front, while\r\nVictor's, which later adjoined it to the north, owing probably to\r\nthe encroachments of the railroad, was built to face the hill-slope\r\nopposite; a top studio, at a corner of its roof, is an addition of a\r\nlater purchaser.[254]\r\n\r\nAdjoining Victor's house on the north was that of his brother, John,\r\nand on the east side of this was built the \"Cave\" and a barn since\r\nconverted into a dwelling; at one time the loft of this barn was piled\r\nwith boxes of bird skins and the surplus stock of the _Ornithological\r\nBiography_, good copies of which now bring from $30 to $50.\r\n\r\nThe three houses which were built and occupied by the great nature\r\nlover and his two sons, though in dire neglect, are not beyond repair;\r\nif such a project were practicable, they should be converted into\r\na museum, and their walls once more ornamented with those beautiful\r\npictures of birds and beasts which father and sons united to create.\r\nThe triangle of ground between Riverside Drive and the Hudson River\r\nshould be spared by the proud city that for years was the home of\r\nAmerica's pioneer naturalist and animal painter, as well as the\r\nscene of his youthful experiments in trade, and converted into a true\r\n\"Audubon Park.\" Such a memorial would contribute to the instruction and\r\npleasure of all the people, for every generation of Americans that is\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nORIGINAL DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

This record proves that Audubon\r\n     upon his first return to France from the United States,\r\n     must have left \"Mill Grove\" on the 12th of January,\r\n     1805, or not more than a day later; three days were\r\n     required to walk to New York, which could not have\r\n     been reached later than the 15th, and probably as many\r\n     more were needed for a letter to go to \"Fatland Ford.\"\r\n     He probably sailed for Nantes shortly before January\r\n     18, the day when William Bakewell recorded that he\r\n     had sent his \"brother,\" Benjamin Bakewell, commission\r\n     merchant in New York, $150; this was undoubtedly in\r\n     payment of the loan which the brother in New York had\r\n     made to young Audubon for his passage to France. The\r\n     next item, of April 22, 1807, was for money advanced to\r\n     Ferdinand Rozier, probably when he was acting as clerk\r\n     to Laurence Huron, in Philadelphia; \"advertisements in\r\n     Philadelphia and Norristown\" possibly had reference to\r\n     the lease and final sale of \"Mill Grove\" of the year\r\n     before. Miers Fisher was the Quaker merchant, who for\r\n     many years served as Lieutenant Audubon's American agent\r\n     and attorney, and who was later the adviser of his son\r\n     and Ferdinand Rozier. Thomas W. Pears, a relative by\r\n     marriage of the Bakewells, was with Audubon in Benjamin\r\n     Bakewell's office in New York, and afterwards associated\r\n     with him and Thomas W. Bakewell in their disastrous mill\r\n     experiment at Henderson, Kentucky. The bill of William\r\n     Thomas, former Quaker tenant of \"Mill Grove,\" was\r\n     possibly in liquidation of his claim against Lieutenant\r\n     Audubon and Dacosta in their mining operations at this\r\n     farm (see the letters to Dacosta, Vol. I, p. 117). The\r\n     credit entry under May 12, 1808, \"formon—31.84,\" may\r\n     represent interest collected on an unsettled claim\r\n     of Lieutenant Audubon against Mr. Formon, a former\r\n     partner in Santo Domingo, in relation to the sale of\r\n     the ships, the _Count of Artois_ and the _Annette_ (see\r\n     Chapter II, p. 33). Dacosta had been urged to apply to\r\n     Mr. Formon's son-in-law, who appears to have lived at\r\n     Philadelphia, but was unable to obtain anything from the\r\n     Formon estate. The \"Cash of Dacosta 299.44\" possibly\r\n     represented interest on the mortgage which we have\r\n     assumed was given to Audubon and Rozier when Dacosta and\r\n     his mining company came into possession of \"Mill Grove,\"\r\n     September 15, 1806 (see Chapter XI, p. 148).\r\n\r\n\r\n8.

We shall take measures to improve the\r\nestablishment, or make an investigation of the lead mine discovered\r\n[on the property], and before continuing the work already begun we will\r\nascertain whether the expenditures made by Sr. Dacosta, have been, and\r\ncan still be, advantageous to us. Finally we shall prepare, or attempt\r\nto prepare, estimates of the expenses and the products which accrue\r\nfrom these, and we shall undertake nothing upon which we are not both\r\nperfectly agreed in principle; consequently we shall both subscribe\r\nto the project which we shall decide upon, in order that neither of us\r\nmay depart from it, and it will be the same for all new expenses which\r\nmight alter the plans that are reached.\r\n\r\nArt. 3.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that half the product of this plantation shall be\r\ndivided between us on a one half basis, and in order to recognize this\r\n[profit], as well as the loss, we shall keep a special book for the\r\npurpose; on one side shall be entered the items of expense, day by\r\nday, and, at the moment this is done, on the other side [shall also be\r\ngiven] the sales and products of the farms, and of all that can result\r\nfrom this business, in such a way that the profit shall be always\r\napparent by the addition of the items which compose the debit and the\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nArt. 4.\r\n\r\nThe house above mentioned [Mill-Grove farmhouse] shall be an object\r\nseparate from all business, in order that we may settle matters as\r\ncompletely as we desire. It is agreed that we shall add to the expenses\r\nof this exploitation, those necessary for life, and others of a common\r\ncharacter, so long as it shall suit us to live and dwell together.\r\n\r\nArt. 5.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be prevented from engaging in any other kind of business, but\r\nbefore undertaking it we shall remain six months in order to gather\r\nfrom the country information of a kind that would be advantageous\r\nto us; we shall then apply ourselves to some commercial occupation,\r\nwhether inland or maritime.\r\n\r\nArt. 6.\r\n\r\nWe are both at liberty to make any journey in order to procure\r\ninformation, and should it happen that we persuade any merchants to\r\nsend goods to Mr. Rozier, Senior, we would establish the condition that\r\nthe benefit which might result from these consignments would be divided\r\nbetween us and the Mr. F. Rozier, Senior.\r\n\r\nArt. 7.\r\n\r\nAll the benefits as well as the losses resulting from our commercial\r\ntransactions shall be divided equally between the partners.\r\n\r\nArt. 8.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the journey and others of a common nature shall make\r\nthe first item of our social expenses....\r\n\r\nArt. 9.\r\n\r\nWe both resolve to maintain friendship and mutual understanding, and\r\nwe agree very expressly that, upon the least difficulty, we shall each\r\nselect one arbitrator, who will be authorized to choose a third, and\r\nwe promise upon our honor to fully accept the decision that shall be\r\nreached, without ever having it in our power to make an appeal from it\r\nbefore any courts.\r\n\r\nArt. 10.\r\n\r\nIn case of the death of one or the other (which, God forbid), the\r\nsurvivor shall have sole charge of making a settlement, in order to\r\ngive an accounting to those entitled to it by law, that is to say to\r\nthe heirs of the deceased, but the partnership cannot be dissolved\r\nuntil after nine years, counting from the day of the date of the\r\npresent [instrument].

Decembre, qui n'est pas aussi avantageuse, Sous plusiers\r\nrapports que votre précédente, mais enfin il faut espérer que l'item\r\nvous prouvera que votre dernier sillon ne sera point déserteur, et que\r\nles occides de fer qui se trouvent se dissiperont en fouillant plus\r\navant, an moins c'est ce que je désire, vous faites bien de faire tous\r\nvos efforts pour avoir des associés & Si cela ne réussit pas, & que\r\nvous vouliez travailler pour notre compte Je trouverai toujours bon,\r\ntout ce que vous ferez, puisque vous avez ma confiance dans ce cas je\r\ncrois que vous s... igé[?], de faire faire des reparations les plus\r\nurgentes Surtout à la maison principale, Devant vous y loger. Quand\r\nà Mr W. Thomas, vous ferez bien de vous le garder, pour toutes les\r\nraisons, que vous me dites & Je crois qu'il ne doit pas sopiniatrer à\r\nse retirer, qu'il ne sache, s'il à mérité, oui ou non, sa récompense.\r\n\r\nJe suis Mr. on ne peut plus faché de ce que vous ayez à vous plaindre,\r\nde la conduite de mon fils, car le tout, bien considéré n'est\r\noccasionné, que par de mauvais conseils & un deffaut d'usage on a\r\naiguillonné son amour propre, et peut être avait-il été assez jeune\r\npour se vanter, dans la maison ou il va que cette plantation devait\r\nlui echoir, à lui seul; vous avez tous les moyens de detruire cette\r\nprésomption, on n' ignore point a philadelphie, que vous avez autant\r\nde droits que moi & que vous ne faites rien que pour notre mutuel\r\navantage.\r\n\r\nJe lui ecris a ce sujet, car il ne men parle point, et je lui donne la\r\ncémonce que mérite son indiscrétion; vous lirez cette lettre et voudrez\r\nbien avoir la complaisance de la cacheter avant de lui remettre. Vous\r\nme dites que je puis m'en rapporter sur son compte an rapport que m'en\r\nfait Mr. Meyers fisher, dans sa longue lettre du mois de Septembre que\r\nMalheureusement je n'ai pas reçu, car Mr fisher, ne me parle point\r\nde lui, ni en bien, ni en mal. Quand à venir dans le pays, cela me\r\nparraît presqu'impossible, rappeller mon fils n'est pas plus aisé, les\r\nraisons qui me l'en fait l'envoyer existent toujours; il ne faut qu'un\r\ninstant pour le faire changer du mal au bien, sa grande jeunesse et sa\r\npétulance sont tous ses torts et si vous avez la Bonté de lui donner\r\nl'indispensable, il sentira bientot la Nécessité de se rapprocher de\r\nvous et pourra vous être d'une grande utilité, si vous exploitez par\r\nvous même.\r\n\r\nIl faut donc Mon cher monsieur, que nous tachions de le ramener par la\r\ndouceur à son Devoir. Si vous avez de l'indulgence pour lui ce sera moi\r\nqui vous en aurai toute l'aubligation; j'espere que la lettre cy-jointe\r\noperera chez lui un changement. C'est mon seul fils, mon heritier, & je\r\nsuis vieux. Quand Mr Meiers fisher aura montré ma lettre au prétendu\r\nbeaupere, il verra qu'il s'est trompé dans son calcul sur le prétendu\r\nMariage de sa fille, car s'il avait lieu sans mon consentement tout\r\nsecours de ma part cesserait des cet instant; et c'est ce que vous\r\npouvez bien si vous voulez avoir cette bonté, dire an prétendu beau\r\npere, ne voulant pas que mon fils se marie aussi jeune; vos lettres du\r\n28 Octobre & 12 Novembre sont à la campagne. Je ne puis point répondre\r\ncategoriquement sur leurs contents; Je les examinerai & vous dirai\r\npar ma prochaine ce que J'en pense. Votre famille que J'ai vu se porte\r\nbien. Nos dames vous rémercient de votre bon souvenir. Je suis &.\r\n\r\n     [JEAN AUDUBON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21.

Prospectus of \"The Birds of America,\" as issued in 1828, when ten\r\nNumbers of the original folio were engraved. (Compare _Ornithological\r\nBiography_, vol. i, pp. 1-16, as supplementary text, at the end.)\r\n\r\n     Under the Particular Patronage and Approbation\r\n     of\r\n     His Most Gracious Majesty\r\n\r\n     BIRDS OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n     from\r\n     Drawings\r\n     made\r\n     During a Residence of Twenty-five Years\r\n     in\r\n     The United States and its Territories,\r\n     by\r\n     John James Audubon,\r\n     Citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\n     Member of the Lyceum of New York; Fellow of the Royal\r\n     Society of Edinburgh; of the Linnean Society of London;\r\n     Member of the Wernerian Natural History Society of\r\n     Edinburgh; of the Zoölogical Society, London; Fellow\r\n     of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries; Member of the\r\n     Society for promoting the useful Arts of Scotland; of\r\n     the Literary and Philosophical Societies of Cambridge,\r\n     Liverpool, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne; of the Horticultural\r\n     Society of Edinburgh; of the Natural History Society\r\n     of Manchester; of the Scottish Academy of Painting,\r\n     Sculpture and Architecture, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nPROSPECTUS.\r\n\r\nTo those who have not seen any portion of the Author's splendid\r\nCollection of Original Drawings it may be proper to explain, that their\r\nsuperiority consists in every specimen being of the full size of life,\r\nportrayed with a degree of accuracy as to proportion and outline, the\r\nresult of peculiar means discovered and employed by the Author, and\r\nlately exhibited to a meeting of the Wernerian Society. Besides, in\r\nevery instance where a difference of plumage exists between the two\r\nsexes, both the Male and Female Birds have been represented. The Author\r\nhas not contented himself with single profile views of the originals,\r\nbut in very many instances he has grouped them, as it were, at their\r\nnatural avocations, in all sorts of attitudes, either on branches\r\nof trees, or amidst plants and flowers: some are seen pursuing with\r\navidity their prey through the air, or searching diligently their food\r\namongst the fragrant foliage; whilst others of an aquatic nature swim,\r\nwade, or glide over their allotted element. The Insects, Reptiles, or\r\nFishes, that form the food of the birds, have been introduced into the\r\ndrawings; and the nests of the birds have been frequently represented.\r\nThe Plants are all copied from Nature, and the Botanist, it is hoped,\r\nwill look upon them with delight. The Eggs of most of the species will\r\nappear in the course of the publication.\r\n\r\nThe Particulars of the Plan of the Work will be found detailed below:—\r\n\r\n     1. The Engravings in every instance to be of the\r\n     exact dimensions of the Drawings, which, without any\r\n     exception, represent the Birds of their natural size.\r\n\r\n     2. The Plates will be Coloured, in the most careful\r\n     manner, from the original Drawings.\r\n\r\n     3. The Size of the work will be Double Elephant, and\r\n     printed on the finest Drawing Paper.\r\n\r\n     4. Five Plates will constitute a Number; one Plate from\r\n     one of the largest Drawings, one from one of the second\r\n     size, and three from the smaller Drawings.\r\n\r\n     5. There are 400 Drawings; and it is proposed that they\r\n     shall comprise Three Volumes, each containing about 133\r\n     Plates, to which an Index will be given at the end of\r\n     each, to be bound up with the Volume.\r\n\r\n     6. Five Numbers will come out annually.\r\n\r\n     7. The Price of each Number will be Two Guineas; payable\r\n     on delivery.\r\n\r\nTEN Numbers being now completed, will give an exact idea of the nature\r\nand style of the Work. All the other Numbers will at least equal these\r\nin interest and execution. It would be advisable for the Subscribers to\r\nprocure a Portfolio, to keep the Numbers till a Volume is completed.\r\n\r\n⁂Persons desirous of becoming Subscribers are requested to apply to\r\nMr. Audubon, or Mr. Robert Havell, Jun. (Engraver), 79, Newman Street,\r\nOxford Street, London.\r\n\r\nWhere Specimens of the Work may be seen: or, to any of the following\r\nAgents:—Messrs. Treuttel, Würz & Co., Soho Square, and Mr. S.\r\nHighly, Fleet Street, London; MM. Levrault and Pitois, Paris;\r\nMessrs. Robinsons, Liverpool; Mr. T. Sowler, Manchester; Mr. M. A.\r\nBarclay, York; Messrs. Hernaman and Robinson, Leeds; Mr. E. Charnley,\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne; and J. B. Kidd, Esq., Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n     NOTE BY THE AUTHOR. Audubon's first Prospectus was\r\n     issued on March 17, 1827, when two Numbers of his\r\n     large work were ready, and the last which I have seen\r\n     bears the date of 1831, when one hundred plates had\r\n     been published. The present citation is from a copy in\r\n     possession of the Boston Public Library; it is printed\r\n     on two sides of white paper, octavo, and bears the\r\n     autograph of \"Wm. Everett, Esq., Aug. 7, 1867.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Prospectus of the Second (partial) Edition of \"The Birds of\r\nAmerica,\" issued by John Woodhouse Audubon, through Messrs. Trübner &\r\nCompany, London, 1859. (See Bibliography, Nos. 9 and 10.)\r\n\r\n     AUDUBON'S\r\n     Celebrated Work\r\n\r\n     BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n     To be published in Numbers, by Subscription only,\r\n     at one half the original price.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned proposes to publish, by Subscription, this well-known\r\nWork of his late Father, J. J. Audubon, F.R.SS.L.&E., etc., from the\r\noriginal Copperplates transferred to stone.\r\n\r\nThis Edition, in softness, finish, and correctness of coloring, will\r\nbe superior to the first, and every Plate will be colored from the\r\noriginal Drawings, still in possession of the family.\r\n\r\nIt will contain all the Plates and Text of the original Work,\r\nembracing more than one thousand figures of Birds, all of the size of\r\nnature, represented in action amid the scenes or on the plants most\r\ncommon to their habits,—together with seven volumes royal octavo, of\r\nOrnithological Biography.\r\n\r\nThe Work will be issued in forty-five numbers viz., forty-four of\r\nPlates and one of Text, each number of Plates containing ten—printed\r\non seven sheets double-elephant paper, of the best quality for the\r\npurpose, 27 by 40 inches, and will be delivered to Subscribers Monthly,\r\nat £2, 8s. per number; the last Number, comprising seven volumes of\r\nText, to be delivered bound with the fifteenth number.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that each Number shall contain as follows: Viz. two\r\nlarge Plates, each occupying the whole sheet; two of a medium size,\r\neach occupying also the entire sheet; and six of the smaller size,\r\ntwo Plates on a sheet; thus presenting ten of the original Plates on\r\nseven sheets, giving a variety in each number. The text is properly\r\nand scientifically classified, and when the Work shall be completed the\r\nPlates can be placed and be bound corresponding with the order of the\r\nText, in either three or four Volumes. The regular issue of the Numbers\r\nwill commence so soon as the number of Subscribers will justify the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAs the Work will be published for Subscribers alone, few or none being\r\nprinted beyond the number subscribed for, it is not possible that\r\nits pecuniary value can ever be much reduced; on the other hand, the\r\nprobabilities are that it will rather be increased. Nor will there ever\r\nbe a time when it can be published at a less price than the present;\r\nfor in estimating the cost the mere expense of manufacturing has been\r\ntaken into consideration, without reference to the original cost of\r\nthe Copper-plates, which was nearly One hundred thousand Dollars; and\r\na very small profit has been charged on the expense thus estimated.\r\n\r\nThe first Number is considered superior in many respects to the\r\nsame Plates in the first Edition, and it is confidently hoped that\r\nsubsequent Numbers will exhibit still greater superiority as the\r\nArtists gain experience. A full list of Subscribers will be published\r\nwith the Work. The Numbers will not be sold separately, except the\r\nfirst, which will be sent, properly packed, as a Specimen, to any part\r\nof the country, free of expense, on the receipt of £2, 8s.\r\n\r\nOrders or communications to Trübner & Co., Booksellers, 60, Paternoster\r\nRow, London.\r\n\r\nNew York, March 31, 1859.\r\n\r\n     J.

For the citation of this rare\r\n     document, from the only copy known to exist, I am\r\n     indebted to the kindness of Mr. Ruthven Deane, who\r\n     writes: \"I found this Prospectus bound in the first\r\n     volume of _The Ibis_ (1859). This copy was previously\r\n     in possession of the late Pierre Verreaux, of Paris,\r\n     France, and is now in the John Crerar Library, Chicago,\r\n     Illinois.\"\r\n\r\n     Ornithologists will be pleased to find that it\r\n     immediately sets at rest numerous disputed questions\r\n     concerning the plates and text of this sole, but\r\n     ill-fated, attempt at the republication of the original\r\n     folio of _The Birds of America_ in America. (See\r\n     Bibliography, Nos. 9 and 10, and Chapter XXXVI, p. 296.)\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ruthven Deane has written me that an examination\r\n     of the account books kept by the Audubons during the\r\n     publication of the large and small editions of _The\r\n     Birds of America_ showed partial payments on the Folio\r\n     by 23 subscribers; the only name among those not listed\r\n     in the _Ornithological Biography_ was that of J. R.\r\n     Peters, who was credited with a payment of $412.00. Mr.\r\n     Deane adds: \"I have a list of the subscribers to the\r\n     1840, 8vo., edition, of 1,095 names, New York, Baltimore\r\n     and Boston taking 501; also a list of subscribers to the\r\n     _Quadrupeds of North America_, 3 volume, 8vo., edition,\r\n     of 2,004 names, New York, Boston and Charleston, South\r\n     Carolina, taking 1,102.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nAUTHENTIC LIKENESSES OF JEAN JACQUES FOUGÈRE AUDUBON\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _1824._—Oil portrait by himself; painted at \"Beech Grove,\"\r\n     William Garrett Johnson's plantation, West Feliciana, Louisiana;\r\n     presented by Audubon to Mrs. Johnson; inherited by her daughter\r\n     and granddaughter, and now in possession of Dr. D. G. Murrell,\r\n     Paducah, Kentucky. Size of original, 12 by 9 inches. Reproduced in\r\n     _The Auk_, vol. iii, 1886 (see Bibliography, No. 184).\r\n\r\n2. _1826_ (?).—Oil portrait by himself (?), 18 by 32 inches, West\r\n     Feliciana; presented by Audubon to Col. Edward Durrive's father,\r\n     later acquired by Mr. E. Curtis, and now in the possession of Mr.\r\n     Thomas P. Thompson, New Orleans.\r\n\r\nMy information concerning this doubtful portrait has been derived\r\nentirely from Mr. Ruthven Deane, to whom its present owner recently\r\nwrote: \"My Audubon, by himself, attracts much interest, and grows more\r\nreal as time makes it familiar.\"\r\n\r\n3. _1826._—Pencil sketch by himself; signed\r\n\r\n          \"Audubon at Green Bank\r\n          _Almost_, Happy!!—      Sepr 1826.\"\r\n\r\n     Made at the home of Mr. William Rathbone, Sr., and presented to\r\n     Mrs. Rathbone; now in possession of Mr. Richard R. Rathbone,\r\n     Glen-y-Menai, Anglesey; for reproduction see _The Life and\r\n     Adventures of John James Audubon_, edited by Robert Buchanan, and\r\n     Maria R. Audubon, _Audubon and His Journals_.\r\n\r\n4. _1826_ (?).—Oil portrait by W. H. Holmes, 36 by 28 inches; painted\r\n     for Audubon's friend, Walter Horton Bentley, Manchester, England,\r\n     and in possession of the Bentley family ever since. Audubon is\r\n     represented in a green coat, a crimson cloak with deep fur edging\r\n     thrown over one shoulder, and with portfolio in hand.\r\n\r\nFor information concerning this fine but little known portrait, as\r\nwell as for the photograph reproduced in Vol. I, p. 412, I am indebted\r\nto Mr. Ruthven Deane. In 1913, Mr. John Conway Bentley, a grandson of\r\nthe former owner, formerly of Glasgow, but then living in Cheshire,\r\nEngland, attempted to dispose of the Holmes portrait in this country.\r\n\r\n5. _1826._—Oil portrait by John Syme; painted at Edinburgh, November,\r\n     1826; supposed to have been engraved by W. H. Lizars, but no trace\r\n     of painting or engraving has been found. See Maria R. Audubon,\r\n     _op. cit._, vol. i, pp. 157 and 165.\r\n\r\nOn November 27, 1826, Audubon wrote: \"At twelve I went to _stand up_\r\nfor my picture, and sick enough I was of it by two; at the request of\r\nMr. Lizars I wear my wolf-skin coat, and if the head is not a strong\r\nlikeness, perhaps the coat may be.\" In writing to his son, Victor, in\r\n1833 (see Chapter XXVII, p. 57), Audubon said: \"I am glad to hear of\r\nKidd & Co.'s publication of Parrots, but I regret that my face should\r\nhave been there from Syme's picture, which in my estimation is none of\r\nthe best.\"\r\n\r\n6. _1828._—Oil portrait painted in London by an American artist named\r\n     Parker, in August, 1828; Parker subsequently accompanied Audubon\r\n     and Swainson to Paris, where he is said to have executed portraits\r\n     of Cuvier and Redouté. On August 25, a few days before starting\r\n     on this journey, Audubon wrote: \"Mr. Parker has nearly finished my\r\n     portrait, which he considers a good one, and _so do I_\" (Maria R.\r\n     Audubon, _op. cit._, vol. i, p. 303). No further mention of this\r\n     painting has been found.\r\n\r\n7. _1830-31._—Miniature painted on ivory by Frederick Cruikshank,\r\n     probably in London, and before Audubon's return to America on\r\n     August 2, 1831. This portrait has become well known through the\r\n     excellent engraving of it by C. Turner, A.R.A., first published\r\n     in London, \"Jany. 12, 1835, for the Proprietor, by Robert Havell,\r\n     Print-seller, 77, Oxford Street,\" with Audubon's characteristic\r\n     autograph. Good copies of the original engraving have become very\r\n     rare. (See Frontispiece, Vol. I.)\r\n\r\nMiss Maria R. Audubon possesses a very faint water-color sketch of the\r\noriginal, which, as she has recently written me, \"was destroyed by fire\r\nat Shelbyville, Kentucky, with many other rare and valuable belongings\r\nof my grandmother's, soon after her death [in 1874].\"\r\n\r\n8. _1833._—Portrait in oils by Henry Inman; half-length, natural\r\n     size; in possession of Miss Harriet B. Audubon. \"Mr. Inman\r\n     has painted my Portrait in Oil, and _I say_ that it is a truer\r\n     portrait of me than even the Miniature\" (see Chapter XXVII, p.\r\n     39). Engraved by H. B. Hall for the second Octavo Edition of _The\r\n     Birds of America_, published in 1856, and the same engraving has\r\n     appeared in later editions of _The Life of John James Audubon,\r\n     the Naturalist_, edited by Lucy Audubon; for reproduction of a\r\n     photograph of the original portrait, see Maria R. Audubon, _op.\r\n     cit._, vol. i, p. 206; and for reproduction of the Hall engraving,\r\n     Vol. II, p. 130, of the present work.\r\n\r\nThis portrait, like the Cruikshank miniature, has become well known\r\nthrough frequent reproduction; both represent the naturalist at\r\nthe full meridian of his working powers, and are among the finest\r\nlikenesses of him extant.\r\n\r\n9. _1834._—\"John J. Audubon\"; portrait drawn and engraved on steel\r\n     by J. Brown; published by Geo. Henderson, 2, Old Bailey, Ludgate\r\n     Hill, London, 1834. A poor drawing of Audubon, in hunting dress,\r\n     published with a biographical sketch, in an English edition\r\n     of Cuvier's _Le régne animal_ (see Bibliography, No. 56). This\r\n     drawing served as the basis of a wood engraving, in which Audubon\r\n     is represented as a much younger man, three-quarters length,\r\n     gun in hand, with thumb on trigger, which appeared in _Gleason's\r\n     Pictorial_ for 1852 (see Bibliography, No. 67.).\r\n\r\n10. (Before) _1839_.—Life Mask, made in London by Robert Havell,\r\n     Junior, and formerly in his possession; acquired from his\r\n     daughters, Mrs. Amelia Jane Lockwood and Miss Marion Elington\r\n     Havell, by Mr. John E. Thayer, and by him presented to Harvard\r\n     University. For reproduction of the mask, for excellent\r\n     photographs of which I am indebted to Dr. Samuel Henshaw, Director\r\n     of the Museum of Comparative Zoölogy, Harvard University, see Vol.\r\n     II, p. 188.\r\n\r\nThe original was made from a dark colored plaster (?), and has a\r\ndecidedly coarse texture. Mr. Harry P. Havell, who possesses a replica\r\nof the original in wax, writes that he obtained from the Misses Havell,\r\nhis cousins, the information that this mask was made while Audubon was\r\nat their home in London; the matter was treated in a jocular way, as\r\nAudubon lay upon a sofa with straws in his nose, while submitting to\r\nthe rather unpleasant ordeal of having a mold made of his countenance.\r\nMr. Havell, to whom I am indebted for the substance of this note, also\r\npossesses the silver loving cup, which Audubon presented to Robert\r\nHavell upon the completion of the second volume of his illustrations\r\nin 1834 (see Chapter XXXII, p. 192). For notice of another mask by\r\nO'Neill, Edinburgh, 1827, see Maria R. Audubon, _op. cit._, vol. i, p.\r\n205.\r\n\r\n11. _1838._—Portrait in oils, three-quarters length, by George P. A.\r\n     Healy; represents Audubon in hunting shirt, with flowing collar\r\n     open at neck, knapsack at side and gun in hand (see Frontispiece,\r\n     Vol. II); painted in London upon the initiative of the artist,\r\n     still struggling for recognition.\r\n\r\nThis portrait, with a number of other paintings, was raffled at Boston,\r\nat a later day, when it was won by the artist, who then gave it to\r\na former patron, Mr. Bradlee, by whom it was presented to the Boston\r\nSociety of Natural History, and it now hangs in the library of that\r\ninstitution. The present reproduction is from a photograph received\r\nthrough the kindness of Mr. Ruthven Deane, who still owns the negative,\r\nwhich was reproduced in Mr. Healy's _Reminiscences_ (see Bibliography,\r\nNo. 197).\r\n\r\n12. _1840-45_ (?).—Cameo, by John C. King; original intaglio, in shell,\r\n     a cast of which was given by the artist to Mr. Kennard, and is\r\n     now in possession of Mr. Frederic H. Kennard, of Boston; cast\r\n     first reproduced by C. Hart Merriam, in _The Auk_ for 1908 (see\r\n     Bibliography, No. 226).\r\n\r\nMr. King was a Scotch artist and sculptor, who died at Boston, April\r\n21, 1882.\r\n\r\n13. _1841_ (?).—Portrait in oils, full length and size, by John\r\n     Woodhouse Audubon; figure seated, with landscape background; gun\r\n     resting on arm, and dog at side. For reproduction, see Maria R.\r\n     Audubon, _op. cit._ This or the following used as the basis of a\r\n     painting by Alonzo Chappel (see No. 23).\r\n\r\n14. _1841_ (?).—Half-length portrait in oils, natural size, by John\r\n     Woodhouse and Victor Gifford Audubon. Original presented to the\r\n     American Museum of Natural History by Mr. Fordham Morris in 1900;\r\n     for reproduction, see Vol. II, p. 226.\r\n\r\n15. _1841_ (?).—Full-length portrait, in oils, by John Woodhouse\r\n     Audubon; original now in possession of the American Museum of\r\n     Natural History; for reproduction, see Vol. II, p. 250.\r\n\r\n16. _1842._—Pencil sketch by Isaac Sprague (1811-1895), an artist noted\r\n     for his paintings of plants and birds. Sprague accompanied Audubon\r\n     on his expedition to the Missouri River in 1843. According to Miss\r\n     Maria R. Audubon, the original drawing is still in possession\r\n     of the Sprague family, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts. For\r\n     reproduction, see Maria R. Audubon, _op. cit._\r\n\r\n17. _1843._—Half-length portrait in oils, by John Woodhouse Audubon,\r\n     representing the naturalist as he appeared when returning from his\r\n     expedition to the Missouri River in November, 1843, with flowing\r\n     white hair and beard; he wears a green overcoat, with fur collar,\r\n     and with both hands holds a favorite gun. The original, which was\r\n     never quite finished, is now in possession of his granddaughters,\r\n     at Salem, New York. For reproduction, see Maria R. Audubon, _op.\r\n     cit._, vol. i., frontispiece.\r\n\r\n18. _1844._—Cameo by John C. King, now known only from the photograph\r\n     made from a cast of the original intaglio, which the artist\r\n     presented to the father of Mr. O. A. Farwell, of Detroit, in 1871.\r\n\r\n\"My father and Mr. King were great friends, and on one occasion, when\r\nfather dropped into Mr. King's studio, he found Mr. Audubon sitting\r\nfor the cameo. Mr. King introduced the two gentlemen and asked them\r\nto start a conversation, which was continued during the sitting. The\r\ntwo men became so animated in their very interesting conversation that\r\nthey forgot where they were, and thus the artist was enabled to catch\r\nthe natural and striking expression of the great ornithologist.\" See\r\n\"The King Cameos of Audubon,\" by C. Hart Merriam (Bibl. No. 226), who\r\npublished the first account of this photograph, and of the previously\r\nmentioned Kennard cast, with reproductions, in 1908. No trace of the\r\noriginal cameos, which were cut in shell, has yet been found. The\r\nFarwell photograph has been reproduced as a medallion on the covers of\r\nthe present work.\r\n\r\n19. _1848-49_ (?).—A daguerreotype made by Brady, in New York,\r\n     probably before 1850, since it was published in that year, and a\r\n     considerable interval of time is clearly represented between this\r\n     first camera likeness and the last which was ever made of the\r\n     naturalist (see No. 20, and Vol. II, p. 280). This daguerreotype\r\n     was first published as a steel engraving by D'Avignon, in\r\n     Lester's _Gallery of Illustrious Americans_ (for which it was,\r\n     in all probability, originally made), in New York, 1850 (see\r\n     Bibliography, No. 62).\r\n\r\n     The same sun portrait was again engraved on steel (size 4¼ by 3¼\r\n     inches) by Nordheim, and published by Hermann J. Meyer, 164\r\n     William Street, New York. It also appeared as a wood engraving,\r\n     brought out by M. P.-A. Cap, in _Le Muséum D'Histoire Naturelle_,\r\n     p. 175, Paris, 1854: a better reproduction, by the same process,\r\n     was given in _Scribner's Magazine_, vol. xiii, p. 275 (see\r\n     \"Audubon's Story of his Youth,\" by Maria R. Audubon, Bibl. No.\r\n     40), in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe original daguerreotype was finally discovered in the collections at\r\nthe National Museum, at Washington, where it had been deposited by Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Berthoud Grimshaw, a daughter of Mrs. Nicholas Berthoud, and\r\nniece of Mrs. Audubon; it was again published by Dr. R. W. Shufeldt,\r\nand Miss M. R. Audubon, in 1894 (see \"The Last Portrait of Audubon,\"\r\nBibl. No. 196). According to the writers just cited, the daguerreotype\r\nwas formerly in possession of Mrs. Gordon, a sister of Mrs. J. J.\r\nAudubon, who gave it to the present owner.\r\n\r\n20. _1850_ (?).—A daguerreotype, representing Audubon as he appeared\r\n     at the close of his career; original in possession of Miss Mary\r\n     Eliza Audubon; for reproduction see _Audubon and his Journals_,\r\n     vol. I, p. 74, and Vol. II, p. 280, of the present work. As to the\r\n     probable date of this picture, see the preceding notice.\r\n\r\n21. _1851._—Death mask; profile from original, since destroyed by\r\n     fire, reproduced in _Scribner's Magazine_, vol. xiii, by Maria R.\r\n     Audubon (Bibl. No. 40), March, 1893.\r\n\r\n22. _1851._—Profile of head; pencil sketch, after death, made by John\r\n     W. Audubon; reproduced by Maria R. Audubon, _Audubon and his\r\n     Journals_, vol. ii, p. 526.\r\n\r\n23. _1861._—Oil portrait by Alonzo Chappel, engraved on steel for\r\n     Duyckinck's _National Portrait Gallery of Eminent Americans_ (see\r\n     Bibliography, No. 74), and published by Messrs. Johnson, Fry &\r\n     Company, New York, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe original of this portrait, which was evidently drawn, with slight\r\nchanges, from the large painting of the same subject by John Woodhouse\r\nAudubon, executed about 1841 (see No. 13), is now in possession of Mr.\r\nRuthven Deane, who has written me that it is done in black and white,\r\nlike all of Chappel's work which was designed for the purposes of steel\r\nengraving, and measures 12 by 17 inches. Concerning this artist, Mr.\r\nArthur Lumley wrote to Mr. Deane on April 26, 1905, as follows: \"I knew\r\nChappel in my boyhood days, when he ranked next to Felix O. C. Darley\r\nas an illustrator; at the same time he was a good portrait painter\r\nin oil. Chappel, in many ways, was a gifted man, and his historical\r\npictures were fine in composition and color. He held a high rank, and\r\nhad no occasion to seek orders, having all he could do, and at his\r\nown terms; most of his work was reproduced by steel-plate engravings\":\r\nChappel, he adds, who died about 1875, was \"a quiet, genial gentleman\r\nwho was ever ready to help and guide rising aspirants in the field of\r\nart.\"\r\n\r\n24. _1907_ (unveiled).—Bust by William Couper; unveiled at the American\r\n     Museum of Natural History, New York, December 29, 1906. Reproduced\r\n     through courtesy of the Museum, at p. 160 of Vol. II of the\r\n     present work.\r\n\r\n25. _1910_ (unveiled).—Statue, by Edward Virginius Valentine; unveiled\r\n     in Audubon Park, New Orleans, November 26, 1910; reproduced at p.\r\n     14 of Vol. I of the present work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the published writings of Audubon, I have included in this\r\nBibliography such references to his life and times as occur in the text\r\nor which possess some degree of merit; all other important literary and\r\nhistorical authorities are cited in footnotes to the text. The titles\r\nappear in a single numerical series, but the arrangement under each\r\nhead is strictly chronological. All references to this list in the text\r\nare indicated usually by title, with the name of the author, and always\r\nby Arabic numerals, in correspondence with the series which follows. If\r\nsome chaff has been admitted to this garner, no corn, I hope, has been\r\nthrown into the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\na. Principal Works\r\n\r\n1.

No. 164), _Monthly American\r\n     Journal of Geology and Natural Science_, vol. i, p. 229\r\n     (1831).\r\n\r\n     John James Abert (1788-1863), long associated with the\r\n     Bureau of Topographical Engineers of the United States\r\n     Army, became brevet lieutenant-colonel in charge of\r\n     that office in 1837; according to Ruthven Deane (see\r\n     Bibliography, No. 216), he was an organizer of the\r\n     National Institute of Science, afterwards merged with\r\n     the Smithsonian Institution at Washington; an ardent\r\n     friend of Audubon, he assisted him in many ways, and,\r\n     as Dr. Richard Harlan affirmed, paid dearly for his\r\n     support by being rejected for membership in the American\r\n     Philosophical Society at Philadelphia. Harlan wrote to\r\n     Audubon on January 27, 1832, that out of twenty-five\r\n     members present on the occasion referred to, five,\r\n     led by Mr. George Ord, Mr. Isaac Lea, and Dr. Hays,\r\n     had voted against him: in his opinion no possible\r\n     grounds could be found for opposing so desirable a\r\n     member excepting his friendship for Audubon and his\r\n     support of the snake \"Episode\" (see Chapter XXVIII).\r\n     In 1832 Abert's paper on the \"Habits of Climbing of\r\n     the Rattlesnake,\" which was written in the previous\r\n     year, had appeared in a Philadelphia journal (see\r\n     Bibliography, No. 107). To this friend Abert's Squirrel,\r\n     _Sciurus aberti_, was later dedicated; see Audubon, _The\r\n     Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America_ (Bibl. No. 6),\r\n     plate 153.\r\n\r\n     [3] C. L. Bachman, _John Bachman, D.D., LL.D., Ph.D._\r\n     (Bibl.

See C. L. Bachman, _op. cit._, p.\r\n     101.\r\n\r\n     [5] This unique copy of _The Birds of America_ bears the\r\n     inscription:\r\n\r\n          To my worthy Friend\r\n          D d.

AUDUBON.\r\n\r\n     The plates thus dedicated were unbound, and apparently\r\n     in their original covers, which consisted of plain\r\n     brown sheets. They passed through the hands of Messrs.\r\n     Burrows Brothers' Company, Cleveland, to Mr. Robert\r\n     H. Sayre of South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and were\r\n     originally received by the American dealers from the\r\n     Messrs. Sotheran & Company of London. Possibly this was\r\n     the set mentioned by Coues, who says \"Trübner ... quotes\r\n     the work with plain plates. I have never seen one in\r\n     that condition\" (_Birds of the Colorado Valley_, p. 612;\r\n     Bibl. No. 181). After Mr. Sayre's death, his library was\r\n     dispersed by public auction at Philadelphia, when this\r\n     complete set of Audubon plates, though in an uncolored\r\n     state, brought $3,200; see _Public Ledger_, November 9,\r\n     1907, and \"Bohemian\" (Bibl.

Two copies of a large plate,\r\n     possibly the only one produced, lithographed without\r\n     colors, were shown to me by Mr. Goodspeed, of Boston,\r\n     in the summer of 1910; these represented the \"Rallus\r\n     crepitans—Marsh Hen,\" and bore the following legends:\r\n     \"By John J.

Hays\r\n     managed to have it not read at Philosoph. Socy, but\r\n     the Lyceum of New York, after reading it, have sent\r\n     it to Professor Silliman, in whose Journal it will\r\n     appear. John Bachman may consider himself a member of\r\n     the Lyceum of New York, and 'mayhap,' a fellow of the\r\n     Linnean Society of London.\" Bachman's paper was actually\r\n     published in the _Journal of the Boston Society of\r\n     Natural History_ for 1834; see Bibliography, No. 125.\r\n\r\n     [50] This paper, entitled \"Remarks in Defense of [Mr.\r\n     Audubon] the author of the Birds of America,\" was\r\n     published in volume vii of _Loudon's Magazine of Natural\r\n     History_ for 1834, and is dated \"Charleston, Dec. 31,\r\n     1833\"; see Bibliography, No. 124.\r\n\r\n     [51] See Note, Vol. I., p. 426.\r\n\r\n     [52] See Vol. I, p. 260.\r\n\r\n     [53] See Audubon's statement of the case, given in Note,\r\n     Vol. I, p. 260.\r\n\r\n     [54] See Bibliography, Nos. 17-21.\r\n\r\n     [55] For this privilege I am indebted to Miss Maria R.\r\n     Audubon.\r\n\r\n     [56] See Bibliography, No. 21.\r\n\r\n     [57] At one time superintendent of the Patent Office at\r\n     Washington, and professor in the medical department of\r\n     Columbia College; he was later professor of mathematics\r\n     in the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia and editor of\r\n     the _Franklin Journal and American Mechanics' Magazine_.\r\n\r\n     [58] See Bibliography, No. 115.\r\n\r\n     [59] See Bibliography, No. 93.\r\n\r\n     [60] This episode was referred to in Chapter XX, p. 316.\r\n\r\n     [61] This was very clearly pointed out in 1908 in an\r\n     excellent article by Mr. George W.

Scott of Cleveland, measured 6 feet, and\r\n     showed eight rattles and a button; the skin and skeleton\r\n     are preserved in the Biological Laboratory of Western\r\n     Reserve University.\r\n\r\n     [68] See Vol. II, p. 55.\r\n\r\n     [69] Bachman's account of these experiments is\r\n     interesting: \"A coarse painting,\" he said, was made on\r\n     canvas, \"representing a sheep skinned and cut open. This\r\n     proved very amusing—no sooner was this picture placed\r\n     on the ground than the Vultures observed it, alighted\r\n     near, walked over it, and some of them commenced tugging\r\n     at the painting. They seemed much disappointed and\r\n     surprised, and after having satisfied their curiosity,\r\n     flew away. This experiment was repeated more than fifty\r\n     times, with the same result. The painting was then\r\n     placed within two feet of the place where the offal\r\n     was deposited—they came as usual, walked around it, but\r\n     in no instance evinced the slightest symptoms of their\r\n     having scented the offal which was so near them.\r\n\r\n     \"The most offensive portions of the offal were now\r\n     placed on the earth; these were covered over by a\r\n     canvass cloth—on this were strewn several pieces of\r\n     fresh beef. The Vultures came, ate the flesh that was\r\n     in sight, and although they were standing on a quantity\r\n     beneath them, and although their bills were frequently\r\n     within the eighth of an inch of the putrid matter,\r\n     they did not discover it. We made a small rent in the\r\n     canvass, and they at once discovered the flesh and began\r\n     to devour it. We drove them away, replaced the canvass\r\n     with a piece that was entire; again they commenced\r\n     eating the flesh exhibited to their view, without\r\n     discovering the hidden food they were trampling upon.\r\n\r\n     \"As it [the organ of smell] does however exist,\r\n     (although in an inferior degree,) I am not disposed\r\n     to deny to birds the power of smell altogether, nor\r\n     would I wish to advance the opinion that the Vulture\r\n     does not possess the power of smelling in the slightest\r\n     degree, (although it has not been discovered by our\r\n     experiments). All that I contend for is, that he is not\r\n     assisted by this faculty in procuring his food—that he\r\n     cannot smell better for instance, than Hawks or Owls,\r\n     who it is known are indebted altogether to their sight,\r\n     in discovering their prey.\"\r\n\r\n     [70] See Bibliography, No. 104, and Vol. II, p. 55; also\r\n     _Ornithological Biography_, vol. ii, p. 46.\r\n\r\n     [71] See Bibliography, No. 125, and for the quotation to\r\n     follow, Samuel N.

Swainson is said\r\n     to have been negotiating at this time with Charles L.\r\n     Bonaparte in reference to a joint compilation for a\r\n     work on the birds of the world; Bonaparte estimated\r\n     that there were then between 7,000 and 8,000 known\r\n     species to be characterized, but Swainson's terms were\r\n     not satisfactory, and nothing came of the project. To\r\n     the above list should be added the letter, evidently\r\n     misdated, of \"April 28th. 1831,\" soon to follow.\r\n\r\n     [102] See Vol. I, p. 438.\r\n\r\n     [103] See Vol. II, p. 88.\r\n\r\n     [104] _Ornithological Biography_ (Bibl.

To paint like Audubon,\r\n     will henceforth mean to represent Nature as she is....\r\n     To relieve, as Mr. Audubon says, the tedium of those who\r\n     may have imposed upon themselves the task of following\r\n     an author through the mazes of descriptive ornithology,\r\n     he has interspersed descriptions of American scenery\r\n     and manners, gloomy forests, tangled cane-brakes,\r\n     dismal swamps, majestic rivers, floods, tornadoes,\r\n     and earthquakes; the migration of the white man, the\r\n     retreat of the red; the character and pursuits of the\r\n     backwoodsman.... Much, therefore, is it to be wished\r\n     that Mr. Audubon would undertake the delineation of\r\n     the birds of Great Britain, which, with his matchless\r\n     talents, aided by those of Mr. Havell, would eclipse,\r\n     not only all other representations of these birds, but\r\n     even the 'Birds of America,' unrivalled as that work now\r\n     is.\"\r\n\r\n     [106] See _Ornithological Biography_, vol. v, p. 194;\r\n     and Theodore Gill (Bibl.

It seems that Dr. James Trudeau, out of ignorance\r\n     or disregard for Swainson's designation, later named a\r\n     woodpecker, obtained near New Orleans in 1837, _Picus\r\n     auduboni_, and by a strange coincidence, as Dr. Gill\r\n     has noticed, the same name was given by two different\r\n     naturalists to the same bird, now regarded as a variety\r\n     and known as _Dryobates villosus auduboni_.\r\n\r\n     [107] The _Cabinet Cyclopædia_ was published by Messrs.\r\n     Longman, Orme & Company, and edited by Rev. Dionysius\r\n     Lardner. Swainson wrote eleven of the twelve volumes\r\n     devoted to natural history. The volume to which\r\n     we refer is entitled _Taxidermy, Bibliography, and\r\n     Biography_, by William Swainson, A. C. G. [Assistant\r\n     Commissary-General], F. R. S. & L. S., Hon. F. C.\r\n     P. S. etc., and of several foreign societies (see\r\n     Bibliography, No. 169). The _Literary Gazette_ for\r\n     August 8, 1840, in noticing this work, said: \"Perhaps\r\n     the amusing and frequent illustration of his character\r\n     is to be found in the autobiographical sketch of\r\n     himself, which he has not only included in this portion\r\n     of his volume, but induced his publishers to forward on\r\n     a separate sheet with the subjoined note:\r\n\r\n     \"'Messrs.

Audubon, and J. B. Chevalier,\r\n     Philadelphia, in 100 parts, of five plates each, to be\r\n     bound in 7 volumes, 1840-44. Complete sets in parts\r\n     are now very rare; previous to 1907 a set is said to\r\n     have been sold for $500; in 1914 one was offered in\r\n     Philadelphia for $750. The introduction to No 1, is\r\n     dated \"New York, Nov. 1839,\" and the fifteenth number,\r\n     beginning volume ii, \"N. Y., Aug., 1840.\" The first\r\n     five volumes (1840-42) were issued with the coöperation\r\n     of J. B. Chevalier, lithographer, 70 Dock Street,\r\n     Philadelphia, but, according to Mr. Ruthven Deane,\r\n     he was an agent who received a commission on sales,\r\n     and, for a time, a share in the profits, but not a\r\n     co-publisher with Audubon; it is also stated that when\r\n     misfortune visited Chevalier in later life, he was cared\r\n     for by Audubon or his sons, up to the time of his death.\r\n     For fuller details, see Bibliography, No. 4.\r\n\r\n     [175] Of these, according to Mr. Witmer Stone (see\r\n     Bibliography, No. 221), 474 are sanctioned in the\r\n     present \"Check List\" of the American Ornithologists'\r\n     Union; seventeen have proved to be identical with\r\n     others; ten are extra-limital; two are hybrids; and five\r\n     have never been found since; of Audubon's suppressed\r\n     species, two have been resuscitated. Audubon is thought\r\n     to have been personally acquainted with 385 American\r\n     species, others being known to him only through\r\n     specimens sent by collectors, or discovered in museums.\r\n\r\n     [176] First published by Ruthven Deane (Bibl.

The total edition of the plates for\r\n     No. 2 was 1,345, and of No. 3, 1,339. No. 11 of the\r\n     plates was the first to run to 1,000 copies in the\r\n     first printing, and this issue was continued to No. 50,\r\n     inclusive, excepting Nos. 3, 28, 29, and 30, of which\r\n     1,500 seem to have been printed; the plates of these\r\n     numbers were done at the lithographic establishment\r\n     of Endicotts, New York, all others being the work of\r\n     J. T. Bowen, Philadelphia. When subscriptions began\r\n     to fall off with No. 51, the edition was reduced to\r\n     1,150, and again with No. 57, to 1,050, which remained\r\n     constant to No. 84, or as far as this record goes. Of\r\n     the text, printed by E. G. Dorsey, 1,200 copies formed\r\n     the first edition of No. 1, 1,000 copies that of No.\r\n     2, and of successive numbers to No. 23. With No. 24,\r\n     the edition was increased to 2,000, and in February,\r\n     1841, the earlier numbers were reprinted, thus forming\r\n     a second edition of these parts, and affording a chance\r\n     for correction of errors.
