There can be no doubt if this discovery is made to be easily\r\nacquired, that millions of dollars would be saved to the community by the\r\nimprovement of herds and a consequent reduction in the price of bovine\r\nproducts, on account of the increased yield and the lower cost of raising\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe State of Pennsylvania, in 1878, appointed a commission to test the\r\nsystem and report upon it. As a member of that commission, we found\r\nthere was with many a superficial knowledge of the subject, with others\r\nenough acquaintance with the system to destroy their faith in it, and\r\nwith nearly all a desire to obtain sufficient practical knowledge of the\r\nsystem to enable them to judge understandingly and to practice it.\r\n\r\nWith a view to fill these wants, we have undertaken the explanation\r\nof the system in the following pages to enable all to fill up their\r\nmeasure of knowledge of the system, so that the superficial shall become\r\nthorough, the doubting acquire new faith, and all see its merits _the\r\nmore they practice and apply it_.\r\n\r\nWe have accordingly given a sketch of M. Guenon and the progress of\r\nhis discovery; some extracts from his preface explaining his views; an\r\nexplanation of his system of escutcheon marks; a description of the\r\nvarious escutcheons and their indications of value and quantity, and\r\ndirections how to practically apply them, together with the report of the\r\nPennsylvania Guenon Commission.\r\n\r\nBelieving that we have thus presented a comprehensive view of this\r\ndiscovery, we trust every one into whose hands this work may come, will\r\npatiently, book in hand, go into the farm-yard and judge of the value\r\nof his stock by the rules here set forth, compare the results with his\r\nindividual knowledge of his stock, and fairly estimate the value of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of the escutcheons are photographed from Guenon’s\r\ndrawings in his last revised edition.\r\n\r\n                                                        WILLIS P. HAZARD.\r\n\r\nMAPLE KNOLL, WEST CHESTER, PA., _September, 1879_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURES ON THE GUENON SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of this work having been invited to lecture a number of\r\ntimes before agricultural societies, and being constantly in receipt\r\nof letters of inquiry about repeating his lectures, takes this public\r\nopportunity to announce that he will make arrangements to repeat his\r\nlecture on the Guenon system, illustrated with a series of large\r\ndrawings. Correspondence is solicited with officers of agricultural\r\nsocieties, granges, agricultural fairs, colleges, farmers’ clubs, and\r\ndairymen’s associations. His principal object being to disseminate widely\r\na knowledge of a system of such great value to his brother farmers, the\r\nterms will be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAt each lecture practical illustrations and instruction is given in the\r\nbarn-yard or field. Address him at\r\n\r\n    WEST CHESTER,\r\n    CHESTER COUNTY,\r\n    PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURE UPON THE CHANNEL ISLANDS, THEIR PEOPLE, AND THE CATTLE.\r\n\r\nThe author having recently spent several months in Guernsey and Jersey\r\nfor the purpose of studying the habits of the people, viewing the\r\nscenery, and acquiring a knowledge of the agriculture, and the breeding\r\nof their cattle, has embodied the results of his visits in a lecture,\r\nwhich he is now prepared to deliver before agricultural and other\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLECTURES UPON AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe author having been appointed Lecturer upon Agriculture to the\r\nDelaware State College, at Newark, Del., will repeat all or part of the\r\ncourse to farmers’ institutes, colleges, schools, &c. The lectures are\r\npopular in character, and not too scientific for general comprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUENON’S INTRODUCTION TO HIS NEW REVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nError is propagated with the rapidity of lightning; before it every\r\nobstacle disappears, and popular favor seems to welcome it. Truth, on\r\nthe contrary, is received with indifference, often even with doubt,\r\nsuspicion, and distrust. Indeed, how often have we not seen the author\r\nof a discovery which, having been accepted and realized ought to have\r\nadvanced the public good and increased the general welfare, come into\r\ncontact with the hatred, the ignorance, and the envy, and thus become\r\nthe laughter of fools and the jest of the wise. To some the inventor\r\nseemed without good sense; to others an ignoramus. Too feeble to struggle\r\nagainst all, he died broken hearted, and left to his powerful antagonists\r\nthe glory of having, perhaps for ages, buried his discovery, and to those\r\nwho bring to perfection cities and fields the deprivation of a good up to\r\nthat time unknown.\r\n\r\nIf more happy than those martyrs for a new idea, I should reach, at last,\r\nthat which concerns me, after twelve years of incessant struggles, to\r\ncause the truth to appear to the eyes of all, I should have nothing more\r\nto desire. Nothing would remain for me, except to bless the generous\r\nhearts which shall have aided me in triumphing over routine and error;\r\nthen on quitting this world, only to bequeath the worthy men who have\r\nso bravely encouraged and seconded my efforts, the task of simplifying\r\nmy discovery, and rendering my method popular to cause the analytical\r\nknowledge of cattle to penetrate even into the most obscure hamlet, and\r\nwhile dividing thus with me the glory of having done this good, their\r\nnames will be held in grateful remembrance by future generations; such\r\nhas been the idea which has guided every moment of my life, all the\r\nefforts of my mind.\r\n\r\nFor nearly twelve years, since I have given my method to the public,\r\nthrough a first edition of my “Treatise on Milch Cows,” the savants and\r\nthe practitioners have been greatly prepossessed with it. When they have\r\nseen me make a successful application before them of my system, by a\r\nsingle inspection of animals which I saw for the first time, they have\r\nexpressed a lively surprise.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom, skillful nurserymen have distinguished more\r\nthan eighty different orders of pears of summer, of autumn, and of\r\nwinter; each of these orders has its distinctive characteristics, as many\r\nfor the shape and the taste of the fruit, as for the time of ripening.\r\nAnd when a tree-grower or an amateur is sufficiently skillful, he\r\ndistinguishes marvelously all these species one from another by a single\r\ninspection, and at whatever time of year it may be. He knows equally well\r\nwhat exposure it is necessary to give to each of them to obtain exquisite\r\nfruits.\r\n\r\nMy first studies had been directed toward arboriculture. I have practiced\r\nwith my father during many years. My principal occupation was the cutting\r\nof trees, grafts, both splits and bandages, and by studying vegetables, I\r\nhad acquired the idea of and an insight into classifications.\r\n\r\nI was better prepared thus for my work of classifying the bovine race, a\r\nwork which no one had ever tried, either theoretically or practically.\r\n\r\nMy classification of the characteristic signs, embraces all the races of\r\nFrance and other countries, without distinction of sex or age.\r\n\r\nUnknown, up to this day, although they have always existed, these signs\r\nhave escaped all the world, even the sagacity of the most celebrated\r\npainters, as well as that of veterinary doctors of the highest\r\nreputations of all times.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of my method should mark an era, for it opposes and\r\noverturns all the prejudiced routines according to which people have\r\npracticed up to this time.\r\n\r\nIt opens a new era in an art in its infancy, in a science whose first\r\nprinciples even were unknown. I should then expound it with the greatest\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThis method is of the greatest simplicity, whatever has been possible\r\nto be said of it, and whoever will become thoroughly familiar with the\r\nescutcheon of the first order of each class, will be able to judge of all.\r\n\r\nEscutcheons are ten in number. They extend, according to their class,\r\nfrom the centre of the four teats to the level of the upper extremity\r\nof the vulva, and may extend in breadth from the middle of the hinder\r\nsurface of one leg, to the middle of the hinder surface of the other. By\r\ntheir form or configuration, escutcheons characterize and distinguish the\r\nten families which together constitute my classification. Behold, then,\r\nto what is reduced, in reality, this pretended immense complication.\r\n\r\nA special figure, placed at the end of each class, serves to indicate\r\nmongrel animals.\r\n\r\nEach of the _classes_ or families is characterized by an escutcheon of\r\nfixed form, always similar to itself, while one does not get out of that\r\nclass or that family, but variable in the dimensions of its surface. That\r\ndimension or that surface should be estimated by square centimeters, but\r\nthat would be too complicated for the practical man; since it depends\r\non the size of the individual, it is estimated by the limits of the\r\nescutcheon placed on the hinder part of the animal. The extreme limits\r\nare the hams, the interior surface of the legs and vulva. The surface of\r\nthe escutcheon, of which the extent varies, has permitted me to divide\r\neach class or family into _six orders_, for each one of which I assign,\r\nin taking account of the shape, the quantity, the continuation, and the\r\nquality of the milk.\r\n\r\nThe escutcheon of the first order is the most developed; is also\r\nthe best marked. The escutcheon of each of the five other orders is\r\nsimilar in form to that of the first order. It is, in some sort, only\r\na proportionate reduction—a diminutive. It is the escutcheon of the\r\nfirst order, with the dimensions reduced or brought within less extended\r\nlimits, reaching no longer the hock nor longer covering the interior of\r\nthe thighs, nor yet reaching up to the vulva, remaining consequently at a\r\ndistance greater or less from these boundaries.\r\n\r\nI have added to this new edition—\r\n\r\n    1st. Two new classes, sub-divided also into six orders, (the\r\n    Left Flanders and the Double Selvage.)\r\n\r\n    2d. Two varieties of escutcheons, having some similarity with\r\n    the others.\r\n\r\n    3d. Finally, the classification of the bull.\r\n\r\nThese three additions, unpublished until now, complete and generalize the\r\nsystem of characteristic signs, by which one can prove the absolute and\r\nrelative superiority or inferiority of each individual of the race.\r\n\r\nThese new forms of escutcheons were known to me at the time of the\r\npublication of my first issue, and which I had already announced; but\r\nthey occurred so rarely in the races which were familiar to me, that I\r\nthought they were not worth publishing.\r\n\r\nBut, now, since I have traveled so much, not only in France, but in\r\nforeign countries, I have convinced myself that these classes occur much\r\nmore commonly in certain races than I had thought at first. I have felt\r\nthe necessity of putting them in my method, and have given them their\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the two new varieties of escutcheons, they are like an\r\nappendix to the classification, and characterize the product of crossing\r\nbetween different classes.\r\n\r\nTo state precisely their signification and to value their corresponding\r\nmilk product, it is necessary to compare these escutcheons with the order\r\nof the class to which they are the most analogous.\r\n\r\nWhen I shall have described the different families of true cows, as well\r\nas their division into orders, the yield or the quantity of milk, their\r\nbutyraceous qualities, and the greater or less period of its duration of\r\nyield during gestation, I will pass to the bastard cows, which, though\r\nperfectly similar in form and color to others, differ essentially from\r\nthem, for they lose their milk as soon as they are pregnant.\r\n\r\nThis close resemblance is a source of errors to the most practiced judges.\r\n\r\nThus have I wished in the description of classification, to point out\r\nprecisely the distinctive signs by the aid of which one can easily\r\nrecognize them. After the study of bastard cows, comes the chapter of\r\nbull re-productors. I have made plain, that in the classifications\r\nof bulls, I have reduced to three the numbers of orders of each\r\nclass, in order to bring the application of the method to the most\r\nsimple expression. The first will comprehend all the bulls, the good\r\nre-producers; the second, the re-producers of middling quality; the\r\nthird, the bad re-producers. I mean by bad, those in which fails the\r\nability for the transmission of the lactiferous qualities. As one sees,\r\nthe characteristic signs with the males, as with the females, have a\r\nsignificant value of the highest importance. With the bull, they portray\r\nthe re-productive qualities, and with the cows the lactiferous qualities.\r\nThe observers who will apply my system of one kind, as rigorously for\r\nthe males as for the females, will observe in the passage of one order\r\nto the other, the same scale of proportion that this established in\r\nthe classification of the cows. Although the classification bears more\r\non the lactiferous or re-productive properties than on the others, it\r\nis important to take in consideration all the other qualities that\r\nthe individuals can and ought to possess to be of an irreproachable\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe cows of the first and second order of each class, in all the races,\r\nwill always give in the same country, a greater abundance of milk than\r\nthose of inferior orders. To recognize the lactiferous produce of cows,\r\nwhatever may be their class or the locality that they inhabit, it\r\nsuffices simply to know the quality of the food which makes the habitual\r\nnourishment of the cows in the place where they are kept.\r\n\r\nIn following in his appreciation, the degree of superiority or of\r\ninferiority of the escutcheon, one will judge close upon the daily\r\nquantity of milk that all the cows of the same country are apt to\r\ngive, for one will know then in what proportion all the figures of the\r\nclassification should be modified. A milk cow ought to be neither too fat\r\nnor too lean, to give her maximum of milk. All confinements in a period\r\nof thinness is prejudicial to the habitual produce. Even when the animal\r\nwould have recovered her strength, she will not recuperate so as to\r\nrestore the quantity of her milk; that can take place only after a year,\r\nand by means of a new calf. A great milk cow, whatever may be her aptness\r\nfor fattening, and her condition of fat at the time of calving, becomes\r\nthin about fifteen or twenty days after calving; the time of her rut\r\nis therefore less near than that of a poor milk cow, because her vital\r\nforces are weaker. Witness the quantity of her yield, which is only that\r\nof a cow of medium product.\r\n\r\nOne can compare a milch cow to a fruit tree, which gives more fruit\r\nthis year than the next. When the sap of the tree carries vigor to\r\nthe development of the fruit, the growth of the wood remains nearly\r\nstationary. When, on the contrary, the tree gives but little fruit, the\r\nsap turns to the profit of the wood, to give, after a repose of several\r\nyears, a greater quantity of fruit, and to continue thus by alternative\r\nsuccessions.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with the cow, for it is seldom that her produce keeps\r\nthe same during three consecutive years, for the reason that, when the\r\nnourishment absorbed by her turns to the profit of the milk, the milk is\r\nmore abundant; when, on the contrary, the nourishment goes to fat, the\r\nmilk diminishes.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the milk quantity should be justly attributed to the\r\ninfluence of atmospheric circumstances of the seasons, which react on\r\nthe quality of hay and fodder in augmenting or diminishing the nutritive\r\njuices of the food.\r\n\r\nCows which are fed in good pastures surpass the product which I have\r\nassigned to their class and their order, while those which are in poor\r\nand wet pastures have necessarily inferior produce, unless the latter\r\nhave in the stable nourishing food, more abundant and more succulent than\r\nthey are able to get for themselves out of doors.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, the well-fed cows, or those grazing on rich pasture\r\nlands, should give as much as twenty to twenty-five quarts of milk per\r\nday; these same cows, taken and fed on poor pasture, will give only about\r\nten or twelve quarts.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, one takes the cows raised on a poor soil, transfers\r\nthem to rich pastures, the milk produce of these same cows will be\r\nsuperior to that they gave in their original lands.\r\n\r\nMy readers should well understand that in the valuations of my\r\nclassifications that I have not pretended to assign a rigorous and\r\nabsolute amount. I have been only able to give an approximate figure to\r\neach class and to each order, adopting the medium limit of the ordinary\r\namount of the different breeds of various localities.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, the care, and the different foods of each country, all\r\nthese different things exercise upon the animal, an influence favorable\r\nor unfavorable, according to the nature of the soil.\r\n\r\nThere are many other circumstances which should be considered, and which\r\nwould disturb the harmony of the figures of my valuation and the normal\r\nquantity. Such are, for example, the case of sickness, accidents, &c.\r\nThat is the reason I have adopted, in determining the quantity of cows of\r\neach order, a medium figure, such as is shown in the classification.\r\n\r\nI will also observe, relative to those animals to which I assign\r\napproximate weight in the course of this work, that, following the\r\ncustoms of commerce, of sale, and of butchers, this weight is dead\r\nweight, the animal being deprived of the skin, intestines, head, feet, &c.\r\n\r\nIf, contrary to custom, I had acted otherwise, and had made the\r\ncalculation for the animal on the hoof, the figures given by me would\r\npresent a great difference, which would increase according to the amount\r\nof fat, sometimes to double the weight.\r\n\r\nThe discovery which I have made of the value of the escutcheon is\r\ndesignated by the contrary direction of the hair, and which had escaped\r\nthe attention of every one, even those most interested in gaining the\r\nknowledge of it. It is necessary also to avow the effect produced by\r\nthe change of direction of the hair is not glaring on the animal. It\r\nis merely a difference of luster, and the gloss on the surface of the\r\nescutcheon and the part of the skin surrounding it. The hair of the\r\nescutcheon is finer, shorter, more furry, and more silky. Its appearance,\r\nat the first glance, makes one think this part of the animal has been\r\nshaved. Compared with the ordinary hair, the skin of the udder appears\r\nto be more designed to be quicker seen on the part where appears the\r\nescutcheon.\r\n\r\nAll animals of the bovine species, without excepting even wild animals,\r\nare marked with an escutcheon, large, small, or medium, regular or\r\nirregular. Their characteristic sign is transmitted with the generating\r\ngerm.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it necessary to say much on that portion of the\r\nescutcheon which extends on the stomach of the beast towards the navel.\r\nThis addition has been thought useless. Enough is shown of the escutcheon\r\nwhen she is standing.\r\n\r\nIn order to see well the escutcheons with all the fullness which my\r\nsketches give them, it must be supposed that the udder of each cow is\r\nseen at its greatest plenitude of milk, such as would separate the hind\r\nlegs to the greatest extent. In this way the escutcheon is seen as if\r\nthe entire skin of the animal was placed flat, or as if the envelope of\r\nthe milk bearing apparatus formed a plain surface, on which are drawn\r\nthe elevations, the depressions, and all that is not visible to the eye,\r\nwithout the aid of hands or of movement of the cow, both that which is\r\nhidden at the further side and in the folds of the udder and of the\r\nthighs of the animal on foot.\r\n\r\nIn order to examine and to distinguish perfectly the escutcheon, one\r\nshould place himself behind the animal and make it advance some steps, in\r\nsuch manner that the movements which it makes in walking should show, one\r\nafter another, the parts which one needs to see.\r\n\r\nOne can also, in passing the nails over the space occupied by the\r\nescutcheon and leading the hand downward from above, in a manner contrary\r\nto the rising hair, and ruffling it, recognize without difficulty its\r\nform and its extent.\r\n\r\nTheoretical explanations are always abstract and diffuse in their\r\ndevelopment. My method may at first appear difficult and complicated,\r\nwhich, indeed, pretended savans have chosen to affirm. Nevertheless it is\r\nnot so, and in order to comprehend it, it is sufficient to study it. It\r\nis with this as with everything else, to know it is necessary to study\r\nand to practice.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful art which I am about to explain to agriculturists is most\r\neasily acquired. Its technical dictionary is composed only of certain\r\nwords, of which the readers should, first of all, know perfectly the\r\nprecise signification.\r\n\r\nThese words are _Escutcheons, Epis or Tufts ascending_, and _Epis or\r\nTufts_ descending. After he knows perfectly the different forms and the\r\nimportance of these characteristic signs, he will know the whole subject\r\nas well as I do myself.\r\n\r\nThe Epis or Tuft, as one will see, participates with the escutcheon\r\nin the distinction of the orders—it multiplies the sub-divisions. It\r\nseems at the same time to complicate my method and to render it less\r\naccessible; but I have not felt myself at liberty to omit it, since it\r\nhas an incontestible and important value.\r\n\r\nIf, among certain animals, the form and extent of characteristic signs\r\nare not exactly those of the drawings, but a sort of intermediate\r\nbetween the characteristic signs of two classes, he who applies the\r\nmethod should approximate them to the drawing of the classification from\r\nwhich they differ the least, and from that deduce the probable value.\r\n\r\nTo render my work perfectly clear, I had to enter into the developments\r\nvery much in detail. Nevertheless, so extensive are these details that\r\nI believe I have given neither too many nor too few, and have confined\r\nmyself simply within the limits of the possible, the indispensible and\r\nthe useful.\r\n\r\nAnd now, whoever my opponents may be, I proclaim boldly and without fear,\r\nthat the escutcheon is the only incontestible characteristic sign that\r\ncan enable one to discern, by simple inspection, the aptitude for milk\r\nproduction of each animal.\r\n\r\nAll animals of the bovine species in good state of health, to which no\r\naccident has happened, and whose escutcheons are of the first orders of\r\neach class, will manifest always, and without exception, as much for the\r\nproduction of milk as for generative ability.\r\n\r\nBeauty of form, to my thinking, represents but an ideal, and although one\r\nought to take it into consideration, it is a simple accessory without\r\nvalue of its own, when the question is that of the production of milk.\r\n\r\nMay I have been able to justify by this work the fruit of the experience\r\nof my whole life, the honor done me by many agricultural societies in\r\nadmitting me to their membership, and by the government which has shared\r\nthe expense of this new edition, with the twofold purpose of encouraging\r\nmy efforts and facilitating the propagation of my method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUENON’S METHOD OF JUDGING OF THE VALUE OF STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago there was dawning upon the world the first ray of a great\r\ndiscovery. A star was rising in the agricultural world, which was about\r\nto shed new light, and like many other valuable discoveries, it was made\r\nby one among the lowly, and partly by chance. The author of this new\r\ndiscovery has said, “Error flies with the rapidity of lightning, all\r\nobstacles vanish before it. Truth, on the contrary, is admitted coldly,\r\noften even with doubt, suspicion, and distrust.” It is owing partly to\r\nthis, partly to the fact that this new light was given to the world when\r\nthe mind of farmers were not ready to _receive_ new ideas of progress as\r\nthey now seek them, and much to the fact that it was the invention of a\r\nforeigner described in a foreign tongue. True a translation of it was\r\nmade through the medium of an American monthly magazine of agriculture;\r\nbut it was one of limited circulation. At that time the number of\r\nperiodicals devoted to that interest was few, and such new and important\r\nquestions were not thoroughly discussed and the knowledge of them placed\r\nin every farm-house in the land, as it is at the present day. Shortly\r\nafter the appearance of M. Guenon’s treatise in the magazine, it was\r\nreprinted in book form, and received the large circulation of sixty-five\r\nthousand copies, between that time and now, and the book most probably\r\nsells better to-day than it did then. By many who procured that book the\r\nsubject was studied, and advantage taken of its revelations, being stored\r\naway in the reader’s mind for actual practice. By the great majority it\r\nwas read, but not studied; driven from it by the apparent complications\r\nof the system and the two hundred sub-divisions of it; by many, perhaps,\r\nit was attempted to be put into practice, but without their having\r\ngiven the subject that close investigation which was needed to prove\r\nthe system correct. It was mostly by this class of persons, because the\r\nsystem was not found to be infallible, that it was denounced and given\r\nup, even by men otherwise intelligent; as if anything human could be\r\ninfallible. Thus it is that by the ignorant its revelations were received\r\nwith incredulity, and by many of the intelligent with doubt; but to the\r\nearnest seekers after practical information, it has unfolded a mine of\r\nwealth, and they have proved the system by continuous experience, and\r\nfound it to be the most reliable mode of judging of the value of every\r\nmember of the bovine species.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy thought that suggested itself to the Pennsylvania State\r\nBoard of Agriculture, to have the system tested by uninterested parties.\r\nBut extremely difficult, it was, to obtain persons to make the test.\r\nFor those to whom application was made declined it on various grounds,\r\nprincipally because, as Guenon himself has stated in his latest edition,\r\nmany pretended savans would endeavor to throw ridicule upon it; many\r\nothers would identify the gentlemen making the tests with it, as if it\r\nwas their system that they were testing; while not a few still more\r\nnarrow-minded, would think they were trying to humbug them. Thus it was\r\ndifficult to fill the places, which offered neither honor nor profit.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, by these extracts, that the Governor appointed three\r\nexperts to test the system. This they did in the summer of 1878,\r\nexamining two hundred cows, jotting down their opinion of the yield,\r\nquality, and time of each of them, and afterwards printing them alongside\r\nof the reports of their owners, so that the public could form their own\r\nestimate of the results of the examinations of the commission. They are\r\nhere reprinted, to show how it was carried out. Particular attention is\r\ncalled to the examinations _of the blanketed cows_ in Thomas Gawthrop’s\r\nherd.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn M. Guenon and his System.\r\n\r\nIt is proper we should inquire into M. Guenon, and the origin and\r\ndevelopment of his system.\r\n\r\nMonsieur François Guenon, a husbandman of Libourne, in France, was the\r\nson of a gardener, and followed for sometime his ancestor’s trade.\r\nHe seems to have had a mind above those in his position. As we look\r\nat his portrait, he appears to have a clear eye, a cool head, great\r\ndetermination, firmness of character, a well-balanced mind, and with\r\nit all, a vigor of constitution which buoys him up, and enables him to\r\nover-ride obstacles. He says himself, he was of an observant turn of\r\nmind, fond of comparing things, and deducing consequences from what he\r\nlearned by observation and comparison, particularly from the Book of\r\nNature. Young, ardent and healthy, with the vivacity of his race, he felt\r\nhimself destined for better things than those a gardener’s life would\r\ninsure him. What wonder then that his eye was keen to see, his mind to\r\ngrasp and analyze any new turn of thought that chance might throw in his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nLike most self-made men, who have made their mark in life’s pilgrimage,\r\nhe set himself to work to improve himself—to acquire that which would\r\nexpand his mind, and fit it to receive any new inspiration, and be\r\nable to develop it. He studied the works of the best writers on botany\r\nand agriculture; and applied his knowledge by following up all the\r\nramifications of the vegetable kingdom, and studied their external signs,\r\nthat distinguish the different sorts, and ascertained their qualities and\r\nproductiveness.\r\n\r\nIn France, they have few fences, and the cattle of a neighborhood are\r\ndriven to the grazing ground, and herded together, and, in turn, members\r\nof each or several families, (the younger portion,) are put to watch that\r\nthe cattle do not stray out of bounds. Such companionship with their\r\nstock makes the owners fond of them, and they are treated as pets, and\r\nbecome very docile. When young Guenon was about fourteen years of age, he\r\nwould drive their cow to graze. His cow he was very fond of, and could\r\nidentify her among any number. She was a good milker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Escutcheon or Mirror.\r\n\r\nIn his authorized account of the discovery and perfection of his system,\r\nGuenon uses the following language: “When fourteen years of age, I used,\r\naccording to country custom, to drive our only cow to the grazing ground.\r\nI was very fond of her, and could have identified her among ever so\r\nmany. One day as I was whiling away the time in cleaning and scratching\r\nmy old companion, I noticed that a sort of bran or dandruff detached\r\nitself in considerable quantities from certain spots on her hind parts,\r\nformed by the meeting of the hair as it grew in opposite directions,\r\nwhich spots I have since called _ears_, from the resemblance they often\r\nbear to the bearded ears or heads of wheat or rye. This first attracted\r\nmy attention, and I recollected having heard my grandfather say that it\r\nwas probable that there were external marks on cows whereby their good\r\nqualities or their defects might be known—just as we judge of the vital\r\nforce of a plant and its qualities by means of its leaves and lines in\r\nits skin. Reflecting on the subject, I arrived at the conclusion that\r\nif in the vegetable kingdom there exists external signs, whereby the\r\ngood and the bad qualities of a plant can be positively known, there\r\nought to exist in the animal, or its kingdom, also, marks whereby we may\r\njudge, by inspecting an animal, of its qualities, good and bad, and I\r\nthought I had discovered one of these signs. I sought the bearded ears\r\nor quirls, and scratched those spots in quest of dandruff, the abundance\r\nor scarcity of this being what first engaged my attention. Every new cow\r\nwas compared with my own as a standard, and her superiority, equality, or\r\ninferiority determined in my own mind. In the course of the comparisons\r\nthus instituted by me, with reference to the dandruff alone, which was\r\nat first the only thing that governed me, I had occasion to remark that\r\ngreat diversities existed among cows in respect to the shape of the\r\nbearded ears (quirls) which produced the dandruff. This suggested a\r\nnew train of reflection and observation, which resulted in my becoming\r\nconvinced that these _shapes_ were the signs by which to distinguish\r\ncows, and to know the good and bad qualities of every individual among\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Imported Jersey Cow BLACK BESS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Imported Jersey Cow TIBERIA.\r\n\r\nBelonging to C. L. Sharpless, Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nIn his original plan, Guenon divided these different shapes into\r\neight classes, each of which was sub-divided into eight orders. As he\r\nprogressed in his investigations, he afterwards added two more classes,\r\nand reduced the orders to six in each class. These he supposed would\r\ncover all cases which might come up for examination. He also divided\r\ncows into three grades, which, in accordance with their _size_, he\r\nstyled high, low, and medium. From this it will be noted that Guenon, in\r\nclassifying cows, was governed first by the class, second by the order\r\nin the class, and finally by their size. These _classes_ he divided and\r\nnamed as follows:\r\n\r\n     1st class, or Flanders.\r\n     2d    ”    ”  Left Flanders.\r\n     3d    ”    ”  Selvage.\r\n     4th   ”    ”  Curveline.\r\n     5th   ”    ”  Bicorn.\r\n     6th   ”    ”  Double Selvage.\r\n     7th   ”    ”  Demijohn.\r\n     8th   ”    ”  Square Escutcheon.\r\n     9th   ”    ”  Limousine.\r\n    10th   ”    ”  Horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe ten orders in each of these classes were simply designated by their\r\nappropriate numerals. Each _class_ was better than the succeeding one,\r\nand each _order_ better than the following one of the _same_ class, but\r\nmight be better than the preceding order of the _next_ class.\r\n\r\nOf this seeming multiplicity of classes, orders, and sizes, Chalkley\r\nHarvey, one of the commission appointed to test the system, writes thus:\r\n\r\n    “Now this may seem somewhat discouraging to your readers, but\r\n    with all due respect to Guenon, to whom all honor and praise\r\n    should be accorded for his brilliant discovery, I think that\r\n    it may be so simplified that every farmer, dairyman, and dealer\r\n    can learn it all in a short time, and may find the study\r\n    quite interesting. I began it laboriously, supposing that a\r\n    mastery of all the details was necessary to make it of any\r\n    use, but more than twenty years of constant application in\r\n    practice has simplified it to my mind, and has added a little,\r\n    I think, to the original discovery. The substance of Guenon’s\r\n    discovery is that the milking qualities of any cow, of any\r\n    breed, are indicated by an outward sign that all may see and\r\n    easily understand. The hair on a cow, as on other animals,\r\n    grows downward on the hind-quarters, but there is an exception\r\n    to this rule on the back part of the udder, where it usually\r\n    grows upward. The first lesson for a beginner is to notice this\r\n    fact. Let him stand behind a quiet cow, and rub the hair on the\r\n    udder both ways until he sees or feels just what I mean. Guenon\r\n    called the surface that is covered by this upward growth the\r\n    escutcheon; others have called it the milk-mirror; but this is\r\n    no improvement in any respect, and I shall name it as Guenon\r\n    did, for there is no real objection to that name, and there\r\n    is serious objection to making confusion by calling the same\r\n    thing by different names. The escutcheon, then, is that surface\r\n    on the cow’s udder where the hair grows upward. But it is not\r\n    confined to the udder, it extends upward above the udder, often\r\n    to the vulva, and outward upon the thighs on both sides of the\r\n    udder. (See Flanders cow, class first, order first.) These\r\n    escutcheons are different in size, in shape, and in quality,\r\n    (quality means the quality of the skin, and of the hair growing\r\n    on it,) and these differences indicate the different milking\r\n    qualities of the cows, including quantity and quality of\r\n    milk, and the length of time they will give milk after being\r\n    with calf. On the edges of the escutcheon where the upward\r\n    and the downward growths of hair meet, a feather is formed,\r\n    and this is most conspicuous on the back part of the thighs\r\n    where escutcheons extend that wide. If the hair is long, as it\r\n    generally is in winter time, the observer can define the limits\r\n    of the escutcheon better by applying his hand, and smoothing\r\n    the hair to its natural place. He will now perceive that the\r\n    hair on the escutcheon is shorter and softer than elsewhere,\r\n    as well as turned upward in its growth, and sometimes nearly\r\n    resembles fur.\r\n\r\n    “Let us now particularly consider the shapes and sizes of\r\n    these escutcheons. There is one general shape to which they\r\n    conform, and that is that they are wider below than above, and\r\n    at or near the top of the udder they narrow in abruptly; some\r\n    continue up as far as the vulva, and even above it, and others\r\n    but a little distance above the udder. The size and shape of\r\n    this upper part of the escutcheon is of less importance than\r\n    that of the lower part, but both must be considered—the larger\r\n    the escutcheon the better. All great milkers have very large\r\n    escutcheons. In large ones the upturned growth often begins\r\n    on the belly, in front of the udder, extends along between\r\n    the teats and up the back part of the udder, over the whole\r\n    width. Indeed, the udder is not wide enough for it, and it\r\n    encroaches on the thighs, where we may find the hair having\r\n    an upward growth on them, inside next the udder, beginning\r\n    not far above the hock joints, and running up as high as the\r\n    wide part of the escutcheon extends up the thighs, and which\r\n    often terminates with corresponding curls in the hair at the\r\n    outlines, and the higher up and wider these are apart the\r\n    better. Though the extension of the escutcheon to the front\r\n    part of the udder on the belly has been mentioned, that is not\r\n    a matter of practical interest in ordinary cases. All that\r\n    needs to be studied is plain to be seen by standing behind\r\n    the cow. When the escutcheon is small, it does not reach the\r\n    thighs, and often does not cover the whole of the back part\r\n    of the udder. These differences in size can be distinguished\r\n    at the first lesson taken in the cow-yard, and when that has\r\n    been done, the next thing is to consider their shapes. A good\r\n    escutcheon is symmetrical. The feathers on the two thighs\r\n    are at equal distance from the middle line of the body, and\r\n    extend up to equal heights on the back parts of the thighs.\r\n    A broad and high escutcheon, (speaking now only of the lower\r\n    broad part of it,) that is _alike on both sides_, certainly\r\n    indicates a superior milker. There is nearly always another\r\n    sign accompanying such an escutcheon, and that is one or two\r\n    _ovals_ just above the hind teats, on which a _fine_ coat of\r\n    hair grows downward. These may be large or small, may be one or\r\n    two, and may be alike in size, or unlike, but they are always\r\n    good signs. Two are better than one, and the larger and more\r\n    uniform they are the better; they are almost always present on\r\n    large and symmetrical escutcheons. No escutcheon is ever first\r\n    class if it has not one or both, and one, at least, of good\r\n    size. What constitutes ‘good size’ will be better learned by a\r\n    few observations than can be taught by inches, and I want to\r\n    leave something to the ingenuity of the learner, to make the\r\n    study interesting.\r\n\r\n    “Now, let us consider the shape and size of that part of the\r\n    escutcheon which I have spoken of as the upper part; that is,\r\n    the narrow portion that has its base on the top of the lower\r\n    and wider portions, and runs up toward the vulva. Sometimes,\r\n    though very rarely, this does not exist at all. Sometimes it\r\n    is broad, and extends all the way up, with perfect symmetry.\r\n    Sometimes it terminates in a curved line, at a greater or less\r\n    distance up; and, indeed, it may be seen of almost any shape.\r\n    As a sign of excellence, the larger and more symmetrical it\r\n    is, the better—but a good _lower_ part of the escutcheon is\r\n    the main thing, and that, as a sign, can hardly be vitiated\r\n    by any imperfection of the upper part. When the lower part is\r\n    very good, there is usually uniformity in the part. A poor\r\n    escutcheon is one that is small, or that is imperfect in form.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Progress of His System.\r\n\r\nWith his mind keenly alive to the pursuit of his investigations, he soon\r\nperceived the difference in the shape of these quirls or marks in the\r\nhair. We can imagine how, when he saw any cow with the same escutcheon\r\nas his own had, he would eagerly and closely question the owner, and\r\nthen make his comparisons and deductions. Then, again, when he would see\r\nvariations from his cow’s escutcheon, whether larger or smaller, though\r\nof similar shape, how he would study them over! When he would ask of the\r\nowner such questions, directed by his knowledge of the cow’s marks, the\r\nowner would stare, and think how the lad could know so well of _his_ cow.\r\nAnd then his secret exultation when the answers showed him that he had\r\njudged aright! We can imagine this young enthusiast going on, from step\r\nto step, filling up his leisure with his acquisitions of his new theory,\r\nwhich was becoming fact, and growing into a system.\r\n\r\nFrom his first step of discovering the dandruff, its scarcity or\r\nabundance, to his noticing the great diversity existing among cows as to\r\nthe shape of the bearded ears or quirls, and being convinced these shapes\r\nwere the signs by which to distinguish cows, and then to make sure that\r\nthe same mark might always be relied upon as a positive sign of the same\r\nperfection or defect; were all steps in the discovery that engrossed\r\nhis whole mind. He gave up his trade, traveled about, visiting cattle\r\nmarkets, fairs, and stables. Conversing and cross-questioning all whom\r\nhe could; fixing the results in his mind, and getting the classification\r\nshaped out. He talked with farmers, dealers, and veterinary men,\r\nascertained their modes of judging of the points of an animal, and found\r\nthey were all by their own favorite signs and marks. One looked to the\r\nudder, the horns, the hide, or the shape; others to the hair, the veins,\r\nor something else; but none judged by the signs which he had found\r\nout. All were uncertain. The most the best judges could do would be to\r\nguess rightly, perhaps, three times out of five, but none could tell\r\nhow long a cow would milk. Perfecting his judgment he would visit the\r\nsame places and the same cows several times in a year, to see how nature\r\nwas operating upon the animals, and their changes of character in the\r\ndifferent periods of gestation, their treatment and food.\r\n\r\nOf course, he soon began to put his theories to practical value, and he\r\ndealt in cattle on his own account. This brought before him cattle from\r\nHolland, Switzerland, Brittany, and other countries. This improved his\r\nopportunities by proving to him that, no matter what country gave them\r\nbirth, all individuals possessing the same marks belonged to the same\r\nclass and the same orders; in short, that nature acted through uniform\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nImperfections and Tufts.\r\n\r\nVariations would arise, from crossing two animals with different\r\nescutcheons, from some defect in marking at the birth, from lack of\r\ndevelopment, or from those freaks that nature sometimes plays. They\r\nalways prove stumbling-blocks in forming the judgment on some animals,\r\nand furnish texts to the opponents of the system.\r\n\r\nAs Guenon continued his examinations, he found that his classes did not\r\nafford a place for all animals, or rather that there were occasionally\r\nto be found cows whose escutcheons while apparently belonging to one of\r\nthese classes, had at the same time, certain distinguished features which\r\nhe styled imperfect escutcheons. These Mr. Hazard, the secretary of the\r\ncommission, described as follows:\r\n\r\n“The perfect escutcheon of each Class is the one which is in Order No. 1.\r\nAll variations from this are rated lower in the scale; these variations\r\nmay consist of a smaller size, therefore, the escutcheon would not be so\r\nbroad or high upon the thighs, nor so broad upon the vertical portion;\r\nthey may consist of the lack of ovals, which would place them below the\r\nfirst order; they may consist of blemishes, which are tufts of hair\r\ngrowing alongside of the vulva, or below it; or they may consist of\r\nstrongly marked imperfections, which may be cuts or slices taken out of\r\nthe escutcheon; or, coarse, harsh, wiry hair on the back and upper part\r\nof the udder. Finally, they may be so decided as to place the animal\r\namong the bastards.”\r\n\r\nOf the tufts, Guenon says all tufts encroaching on the escutcheon\r\ndiminish its value, except the oval ones on the udder; that is to say,\r\nthey indicate a diminished aptitude for yielding milk. The size and\r\nlocation of these tufts make the animals descend one or more orders in\r\nthe classification. It is, therefore, important to attend to all the\r\npatches of descending hairs which lessen the size of the escutcheon,\r\nwhether these occur in the middle of it or form indentations on the\r\nsides. These indentations, partly concealed by the folds of the skin,\r\nare sometimes perceived with difficulty. Many cows, which at first\r\nglance appear to be well-marked, on close examination display their\r\ndeficiencies, and want of this scrutiny often causes mistakes in\r\nestimating the value of cows, and thus the system suffers.\r\n\r\nGuenon says the cause of the defects, as exhibited by the tufts on the\r\nthighs, is that the veins situated beneath, on either side of the belly,\r\nhave a peculiarity; that they are contracted, and there is a small\r\nopening for it where it pierces the abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is an intermingling of two forms of escutcheons. This\r\ndepends upon the crossing between a cow of one class and a bull of\r\nanother. This is one of the difficulties to be encountered in precisely\r\nestimating the value of the animal.\r\n\r\nGuenon classified the seven tufts, into two kinds: Those on which the\r\nhair ascends, and those on which it descends. Those with ascending\r\nhairs are simply traces which encroach on the descending hair outside\r\nthe escutcheon, either on one side or beneath the vulva. Those with the\r\ndescending hair are on the escutcheon, and are five in number.\r\n\r\n1. _Epi ovale_, oval tuft. These are situated on the udder, like those\r\non class one, two, three, four, order first. They are good signs, if of\r\ndescending fine hair, small, and regular. They are mostly seen on only\r\nthe best cows, though occasionally to be met with in some of the lower\r\norders.\r\n\r\n2. _Epi fessard_, ischiatic tuft. These are found on the vertical\r\nescutcheon on one or both sides of the vulva, as in class four, five,\r\norders two, three, four; and very conspicuously in the bastards of class\r\nthree, four, five, six. They are of ascending hair, and never seen in\r\nfirst class cows, but in most others to a limited extent.\r\n\r\n3. _Epi babin_, lip-shaped tuft. This is only seen as a sign of\r\ndeterioration in the two first classes; it is made by descending hairs,\r\nand is a defect for milking qualities. It is like a string hanging over\r\nthe top of the vulva, and making its outline a little below it on each\r\nside. It is seldom seen.\r\n\r\n4. _Epi vulvé_, vulvan tuft. This is also a deteriorating sign; is a tuft\r\nof descending hair directly under the vulva, as in class one, orders\r\nthree and four.\r\n\r\n5. _Epi batard_, perinæal tuft. This is always a bad mark, as it exists\r\non otherwise good marked cows, and indicates a diminution of milk, as\r\nsoon as the cow becomes pregnant. It is seen on class one, bastard. A cow\r\nis to be looked upon with suspicion that has this mark largely developed.\r\n\r\n6. _Epi cuissard_, thigh tufts. These are diminutions of the escutcheon\r\nby encroachment of descending hair, and denote a diminishing of the\r\nquantity of milk, proportionate to their extent. See class one and two,\r\norder four.\r\n\r\n7. _Epi jonctif_, mesian tuft. The mesian or dart-like tuft, with soft\r\nsilky ascending hair, is rarely seen, and only in those classes in which\r\nthe escutcheon does not ascend to the vulva. It is like a V hanging\r\nbeneath the vulva, and is not fully represented in the plates, though\r\nclass ten, order two, shows it somewhat.\r\n\r\nIn these observations among cows, not only during their work as members\r\nof the commission, but also in preceding examinations, Messrs. Blight,\r\nHarvey, and Hazard noticed a series of marks, which they have denominated\r\n_thigh ovals_. The plate showing the escutcheon of Mr. Hazard’s Jersey\r\ncow furnishes one of the best illustration of these marks yet met with by\r\nthe commission. Where the vertical escutcheon joins and widens out into\r\nthe thigh escutcheon, there is usually a dip of a curved shape more or\r\nless in extent. In the plate above alluded to these thigh ovals descend\r\nnearly to the base of the udder. In their careful examination of more\r\nthan two hundred cows, the commission always found these marks only on\r\ngood cows.\r\n\r\nIn his examinations Guenon found cows of apparently each class with\r\ncertain variations in their markings which distinguished them and\r\nprevented their incorporation into any class, and, yet the similarity\r\ngives them a claim in their particular class. In all cases he claims to\r\nhave noted that cows thus marked would milk as well as other members\r\nof their class, until they were got with calf, but as soon as this was\r\naccomplished, the quantity of milk fell off rapidly. The commission\r\nclaim it is this style of marking which is most likely to deceive the\r\nsuperficial or amateur investigators, and that these have caused the\r\nassertion that a poor cow may be well marked, when in reality, if\r\nproperly understood, she was not well marked. This class of cows Guenon\r\nstyled _Bastards_, and he practically assigned to them a distinctive or\r\nseventh _order_ in each class.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Guenon seems to have first reduced his system to a classified\r\nbasis, and from that time until 1828 he appears to have given it much of\r\nhis time and attention. Having, as he deemed, sufficiently arranged and\r\ntested his system, he, in 1828, applied to the academy of Bordeaux for a\r\npublic test of the correctness of his mode of judging of cows and their\r\nmilking value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Escutcheon of ROSIE.\r\n\r\nThorough-bred Jersey Cow, belonging to Willis P. Hazard.]\r\n\r\nThe following, from the proceedings of the academy, shows that Guenon\r\ndid not make his system common property. The minutes of the academy,\r\nunder date of June 3, 1828, contains the following record: “Mr. Francis\r\nGuenon, of Libourne, possessor of a method which he deems infallible for\r\njudging, by mere visual examination, of the goodness of milch cows, and\r\nthe quantity of milk which each can yield, has solicited the Academy\r\nto cause the efficaciousness of this method to be tested by repeated\r\nexperiments. The case presented by this request was one of a secret\r\nmethod of judging, which the possessor was not willing to reveal. On the\r\nother hand, it seemed difficult to admit that the external sign, whatever\r\nit might be, by which Mr. Guenon judges, could always bear a proportional\r\nrelation to the quantity of milk yielded by a cow. Nevertheless, the\r\nacademy deemed it proper to appoint a committee charged with making the\r\nexamination. Trials have been made with care, and under precautions\r\nnecessary for precluding all collusion. The cows used for the purpose\r\nbelonged to three different herds, and amounted to thirty in number, and\r\nthe result has been to establish, to the satisfaction of the committee,\r\nthat Mr. Guenon really possesses great sagacity in this line. So long,\r\nhowever, as his method shall be kept secret, it cannot be judged of, nor\r\nrewarded by, the academy. Governed by these considerations, the academy,\r\nhaving ascertained from Mr. Guenon that he is willing to submit to every\r\ntest that may be proposed, and to disclose his secret, upon receiving\r\na just indemnity, has referred him to the prefect, and has engaged to\r\nrecommend him to the favorable notice of that magistrate, who is ever\r\ndisposed to promote all that tends to improve it.”\r\n\r\nFrom 1822 to 1827, it would seem that Guenon perfected and studied his\r\nsystem, but it does not seem to have come promptly before the public,\r\nuntil the agricultural society of Bordeaux took upon itself a careful\r\ninvestigation of the whole system. From the detailed report of this\r\ncommittee, appointed by this society to test the knowledge of Guenon, we\r\ntake the following as illustrating, not only the results reached by them,\r\nbut also the manner of conducting the examination:\r\n\r\n    “Every cow subjected to examination was separated from the\r\n    rest. What Mr. Guenon had to say in regard to her was taken\r\n    down in writing by one of the committee; and immediately after,\r\n    the proprietor, who had kept at a distance, was interrogated,\r\n    and such questions put to him as would tend to confirm or\r\n    disprove the judgment pronounced by Mr. Guenon. In this way we\r\n    have examined, in a most careful manner—note being taken of\r\n    every fact and every observation made by any one present—upward\r\n    of sixty cows and heifers, and we are bound to declare that\r\n    every statement made by Mr. Guenon, with respect to each of\r\n    them, whether it regarded the quantity of milk, or the time\r\n    during which the cow continued to give milk after being got\r\n    with calf, or finally, the quality of the milk as being more\r\n    or less creamy or serous, were confirmed, and its accuracy\r\n    established. The only discrepancies which occurred, were\r\n    some slight differences in regard to the _quantity_ of milk,\r\n    but these we afterward fully satisfied ourselves were caused\r\n    entirely by the food of the animal being more or less abundant.\r\n\r\n    “The result of this first test seems conclusive, but they\r\n    acquire new force from those of a second trial in which the\r\n    method was subjected to another test through M. Guenon and his\r\n    brother. Your committee, availing themselves of the presence\r\n    of the latter, caused the same cows to be examined by the\r\n    two brothers, but separately, so that after a cow had been\r\n    inspected, and her qualities as indicated by the signs in\r\n    question had been pronounced upon by one of the brothers, he\r\n    was made to withdraw; then the other brother, who had been\r\n    kept aloof, was called up, and desired to state the qualities\r\n    of the same animal. This mode of proceeding could not fail\r\n    to give rise to difference, to contradiction even, between\r\n    the judgments of the two brothers, unless their method was a\r\n    positive and sure one. Well, gentlemen, we must say it, this\r\n    last test was absolutely decisive. Not only did the judgment\r\n    of the two brothers accord perfectly together, but they were\r\n    in perfect accordance also with all that was said by the\r\n    proprietors in regard to the qualities, good or bad, of every\r\n    animal subject to this examination.”\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May, 1837, a similar test was made by the agricultural\r\nsociety of Aurillac, whose committee, in their report, use the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\n    “Each cow was examined separately by M. Guenon, who wrote his\r\n    notes upon her, and delivered the paper closed to one of us.\r\n    Immediately after, another member of the committee questioned\r\n    the owner of the cow, or the person in charge of her, in regard\r\n    to her daily yield of milk, its quality, and the time during\r\n    which she continued to give milk after being got with calf.\r\n    The answers were taken down in writing, and then compared with\r\n    the notes written by M. Guenon. They were generally found to\r\n    accord, and proved to the satisfaction of your committee and of\r\n    every one present, all of whom attended with lively interest\r\n    to these proceedings, that M. Guenon possesses great sagacity\r\n    in judging of cattle, and that his method rests upon a sure\r\n    foundation.”\r\n\r\nThe Bordeaux committee added: “To the proprietors and to the lookers-on,\r\nall this was very surprising for the examinations were as quickly made\r\nas the results were certain. As to ourselves to whom the method was no\r\nlonger a secret, it was with renewed interest and astonishment that we\r\nviewed the accuracy of the results. _This system we do not fear to say is\r\ninfallible._ We only regretted the whole society was not present.”\r\n\r\nThe committee further reported that Mr. Guenon had, after more than\r\ntwenty years observations and researches, discovered certain natural and\r\npositive signs that were proof against all error, while the writers and\r\nprofessors who have particularly occupied themselves with the bovine\r\nrace, can only indicate some vague signs for judging of the fitness of\r\ncows for secreting milk. That this method is valuable, whether it tells\r\nthe yield of milk only, or indicates the improvement of breeds, which\r\nare liable to deterioration from mismanagement in crossing, and that it\r\nis applicable not to full-grown animals alone, but also to calves at as\r\nearly an age as three months. Thus it affords a sure means of forming a\r\njudgment of full-grown animals, about which we might be misled on account\r\nof their form and their parentage, and secures the improvement of herds\r\nby enabling us to dispose of those calves which will not repay the cost\r\nof rearing them. We shall thus no longer rear calves at great expense\r\nfor two or three years that should have been consigned to the butcher,\r\nnor sell calves that would pay best to rear. If this system is pursued,\r\nonly cows and bulls of best quality will be kept, and in very few years\r\nhow great will be the improvement of our herds, and largely increased the\r\ncheapest and best of all foods, milk, and the production of butter and\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nThe committee of the Agricultural Society of Bordeaux, therefore, decreed\r\nMr. Guenon a gold medal, made him a member of the society, ordered fifty\r\ncopies of his work, and distributed one thousand copies of their full\r\nreport among all the agricultural societies of France.\r\n\r\nThe next public test Mr. Guenon submitted his system to, was that by the\r\nAgricultural Society of Aurillac, and that society reported that Mr.\r\nGuenon examined the herd of their president, of one hundred cows, from\r\nwhich were selected designedly, the best, the moderately good, and the\r\nmost indifferent of the establishment. Upon each, Mr. Guenon pronounced\r\nwith precision, and his decisions corresponded almost invariably with the\r\nstatements of the persons in charge. The only variations were very slight\r\nones, in regard to the quantity given. But this herd was fed unusually\r\nhigh, and Guenon was totally unaccustomed to the usages of the country in\r\nfeeding cattle, and this caused him to pronounce the yield a little less\r\nthan it really was. A proof of his system, for he declares the yield will\r\nvary according to the feed and management, which all observant farmers\r\nknow to be the case. Mr. Guenon examined some of the cows a second time,\r\nand also the calves, and those calves he assigned to the first orders the\r\ncowherds said were from their best cows, that gave a great deal of milk.\r\n\r\nThe notes of his reëxaminations corresponded exactly with his first\r\nstatements. The committee therefore awarded Mr. Guenon a gold medal, made\r\nhim a corresponding member, subscribed for twenty-five copies of his book\r\nfor each of the sub-societies, and distributed their report through all\r\nthe agricultural channels of France.\r\n\r\nWith these testimonials, the highest that could be procured in France,\r\nMr. Guenon went on with the publication of his book, which had a wide\r\ncirculation in every department of France. And he was finally granted\r\na pension for life of three thousand francs a year by the French\r\ngovernment, after the National Assembly’s committee on agriculture had\r\ngiven the system a thorough test. In the presence of fifty of the most\r\neminent agriculturists, M. Guenon made his examinations, and judged\r\ncorrectly of all but one of the quantity, of all but one of the time,\r\nand of all of the quality; and the committee reported the results were\r\naltogether conclusive, and that his discovery had reached to the dignity\r\nof a science. They also declared the daily production of milk in France\r\nmight be increased by several millions of pints daily, and that the\r\nabundance and quality of milk in the dams must contribute largely to\r\nthe improvement of the progeny. They voted him the pension, and invited\r\nhim to deliver lectures in the different veterinary, agricultural, and\r\nnormal schools of the kingdom, and before the different agricultural\r\nsocieties, as “the speediest and best means of spreading the knowledge\r\nof this discovery,” and “to repair the time lost in ridicule, doubt, or\r\nindifference—the inevitable preface to all under-takings beneficial to\r\nhumanity.”\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing account of Mr. Francis Guenon, it will be seen that,\r\nby his indomitable perseverance in perfecting his system or method,\r\nhe raised himself from the ranks of a poor gardener’s boy to the\r\nposition of a great benefactor, and was presented with various medals\r\nand decorations, and a large sum of money voted to him. Surely, such\r\na brilliant position must have been won entirely by merit, for he had\r\nneither means nor influence to advance him into notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Ovals.\r\n\r\nThe ovals on the udder are spoken of by Guenon, and our experience is\r\nthat they are always indicative of a good yield; particularly, when they\r\nare uniform in size and position, and of fine, soft hair, descending on\r\nthe udder. But there is another set of marks, which the Pennsylvania\r\nGuenon Commission have denominated thigh ovals, which are an invariable\r\nindication of a good cow, particularly when she is otherwise well-marked.\r\nOf these, Guenon does not speak. Eusebius H. Townsend and Chalkley Harvey\r\nwere the first to call attention to them, and Charles L. Sharpless has\r\nwritten of them. Our own cow, which took the premium over all the Jersey\r\ncows, at the fall exhibition, in 1878, of the Chester County Agricultural\r\nSociety, has them most extraordinarily developed. As she is a very\r\nthorough example of this marking, we have had the likeness made of her\r\nescutcheon, and request the reader’s attention to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Bastards.\r\n\r\nGuenon denominates those cows which give milk, much or little, so long\r\nas they are not got with calf; but, when impregnated, begin to fall off\r\nin their milk. The term he uses is _batard_, which means, in English,\r\nbastard, spurious, of a mixed breed, mongrel. We should have preferred\r\nto call them spurious cows, as the term bastard does not exactly express\r\nthe meaning we apply to that word; but, as it has before been translated\r\nbastard, and is so known by many, we retain it.\r\n\r\nThe bastards are often the best looking cows; have finely developed\r\nescutcheons, and many give a great deal of milk, some poor quality and\r\nsome rich; but, as soon as they are pregnant, they go dry very soon, or\r\nfall off rapidly in their milk, while others give very little milk at\r\nall. From their fine show, they deceive a great many, and Guenon cautions\r\nbuyers, as the most skillful will make mistakes. He has, however, given a\r\nseries of drawings, by which they can generally be discovered.\r\n\r\nThese bastards mostly conceive well, and the first time they are put to\r\nthe bull, they vary in the quality of milk they give like other cows. The\r\nflow of milk is at its height during the first eight days after calving,\r\nthough of bad quality. It then diminishes a little, and keeps on at about\r\nthe same yield until she conceives again, when it diminishes again, more\r\nor less rapidly.\r\n\r\nTo discover a bastard, consult the engravings which are given to each\r\nclass. To the first class, the Flanders, there are two kinds. The first,\r\nwhich is the most common, has on each edge of the vertical escutcheon,\r\na feathery appearance, and where this is strongly marked by the down-\r\nand up-growing hairs meeting, and they interlock and stand out from the\r\nskin, and, besides, are harsh and wiry, and generally shiny, glistening,\r\nand looking of lighter color, _beware of them_. The harsher, coarser\r\nthey are, the shorter time will the cow milk after getting with calf.\r\nThe second kind of bastards among the Flanders will have an oval on the\r\n_vertical_ escutcheon, generally near the middle part, of about two to\r\nthree inches in length, by one and a half to two inches wide, on which\r\nwill be found coarse wiry hair, and the harsher it is, and the larger\r\nthe oval is, the sooner the cow will cease to milk. It may often be\r\ndiscovered by the glistening appearance of the hair on it.\r\n\r\nOn all the other classes, the bastard marks consist of two oval patches\r\nof hair, one on each side of the vulva; and the larger they are, the more\r\npointed in shape, and the coarser and more wiry the hair on them, the\r\nsooner the cow will cease to milk.\r\n\r\nThe importance of learning the bastard marks is very great, as the buyer\r\ncan safely avoid them, and leave them to those less skilled. While he\r\nmay buy the less showy looking cow for much less money, and get a better\r\nanimal than the unskilled man will obtain even for the higher price.\r\n\r\nAll animals are more readily judged correctly, and the system can be\r\nlearned more easily, in summer than in winter, both on old and young;\r\nfor then the winter coat of hair is off, and the hair is shorter, and\r\nthe escutcheon is more easily perceived. The skin, also, is more natural\r\nand soft, and the hair is usually not so harsh to the feel; and the cows\r\nare cleaner, and all marks or blemishes more quickly seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Apply the System Practically.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to apply the foregoing rules and hints practically.\r\nIn doing so, we may repeat some that has been before said, but it will\r\nonly impress it the stronger in the mind of the learner.\r\n\r\nThis classification embraced all the kinds of cows known to Guenon, each\r\nindividual escutcheon corresponding with one of the orders of those\r\nclasses. The _class_, the _order_ and the _size_ of an animal indicate\r\nher yield of milk, and this will always be found to correspond with her\r\nescutcheon. Every cow has an escutcheon which can be recognized, and\r\naccording as it is free from blemish or imperfection, just in that degree\r\ndoes she approach perfection in her class.\r\n\r\nGuenon, in the last edition of his work, has altered and simplified\r\nhis classification somewhat, for he divided it into ten CLASSES, and\r\nsix ORDERS to each class. He maintained his three grades of size. But\r\nour experience shows that the cows in this country do not vary so much\r\nin size as they probably do in France, for there they have the little\r\nBrittany cow, which is very small but good, and, of course, they have\r\nalso cows as large as our Durhams or the Holsteins. Only this, bear in\r\nmind, that cows, as a general rule, all other things being equal, will\r\nvary in their yield somewhat according to their size; and in judging cows\r\napply that rule, for it is part of Guenon’s system, and they will vary in\r\nthe quality according to the breed. Well, then, for practical purposes,\r\nwe need only study sixty _escutcheons_, that is ten different shapes\r\ncalled _Classes_, and six grades to each of those shapes, more or less\r\nperfect, which are called _Orders_. To these must be added ten more for\r\na _Bastard_ to each class. And it is really necessary to study perfectly\r\nonly the first four orders of each class and the _Bastard_ marks, as it\r\nis not worth while to purchase or pay much attention to any cows lower in\r\nthe scale than the fourth order of any class. And to simplify it still\r\nmore, you will notice the thigh escutcheons of the first orders have all\r\nnearly the same shovel shape, so that by remembering this you need only\r\nstudy the vertical portions to readily place the animals in their proper\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Escutcheon.\r\n\r\nThe escutcheon was so-called, we presume, from its similarity to the\r\nshape of a shield or escutcheon, and on a first-class cow it will be very\r\nlike it, and somewhat like a round-pointed shovel. On this escutcheon,\r\nthe hair will generally be of a different color from that bordering\r\nit, most generally rather darker, always shorter, and more nearly\r\nresembling fur. This difference in color is produced by the UP-growing\r\nhair contrasting with the DOWN-growing surrounding it. The hair of the\r\nescutcheon should be short, soft, and fine; and the skin very soft, like\r\na kid glove, thin, and oleaginous. And if the cow gives good rich milk,\r\nthis skin will be of a rich, golden, or nankeen hue. Often where you\r\nhandle a skin of this character the hands will feel oily, and soiled with\r\nrich dandruff.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Shape of the Escutcheon.\r\n\r\nThe Escutcheon varies in shape, and Guenon named his ten classes from\r\ntheir shapes.\r\n\r\nThe first class, he called Flandrine or Flanders, because it is the best,\r\nand he named it from the best cows he knew, those from Flanders, or the\r\nFlemish breed, and they had more of this shaped escutcheon than any other\r\nbreed; a quiet but sure proof of the truth of his system.\r\n\r\nThe second class he called Flandrine à gauche, because although it had\r\nthe Flanders shape, it was on the _left_ flank, he called it therefore\r\nthe Left Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe third class are the Lisière, or The Selvage, from its appearance to a\r\nselvage, or binding of a piece of cloth.\r\n\r\nThe fourth class are the Courbe-Ligne, or the Curveline, because their\r\nescutcheon is lozenge-shaped, formed by a curved line which sides to the\r\nright and left, and rises to about five or six centimeters from the vulva.\r\n\r\nThe fifth class he denominated Bicorne, or the Bicorn cow, because the\r\nupper part of this escutcheon forks in two horns.\r\n\r\nThe sixth class, Double-Lisière, or Double Selvage, has an entirely\r\narbitrary name, and it is an odd freak of nature.\r\n\r\nThe seventh class is called Poitevine, or Demijohn, from a fancied\r\nresemblance to some kinds of demijohns.\r\n\r\nThe eighth class is Equerrine, or Square-Escutcheon, as it is square at\r\nthe upward part.\r\n\r\nThe ninth class is the Limousine, as it was on a cow from that Province\r\nthat Guenon first saw this shaped escutcheon.\r\n\r\nThe tenth class is called Carrésine, or Horizontal, because the upward\r\npart of the escutcheon is cut off squarely by a horizontal line.\r\n\r\nTo each of the above ten CLASSES, Guenon has placed six ORDERS, which are\r\nvariations of the escutcheon, formed by a reduced size and by various\r\nimperfections. If the reader will remember always, that the first class\r\nis better than the second class, and the second class better than the\r\nthird class, and so on down the scale, to the end of the classes, he\r\nwill have gained the first step in acquiring the system. Then the next\r\npoint to remember is similar, that is, that the first _order_ of every\r\n_class_ is better than the second order of that class, and so on down the\r\nscale of the orders, until the sixth. Then he must learn the different\r\nshapes; first, the characteristic shape of each class, as represented by\r\nthe first order of that class, and connect with this, in his mind, the\r\nnumber of quarts a first-class cow, in good feed and condition, should\r\ngive, as represented by that escutcheon, in her full flow of milk. Then\r\nhe can next learn the variations in size and shape from this pattern\r\nescutcheon, and that will enable him to tell which order of her class\r\nto put her in, and that will then inform him what quantity of milk she\r\nwill give, and how long she will give it when with calf. And we repeat\r\nhere, it is necessary only to acquire the knowledge of the first three or\r\nfour orders of each of the ten classes, as if the cow examined does not\r\ncome within those orders, she is not worth examining further nor keeping\r\nlonger, nor certainly worth purchasing. Then the learner must next\r\nacquire a knowledge of the distinguishing marks which point out a Bastard\r\ncow, for an account of which marks, see under that head.\r\n\r\nNow all of this knowledge must, to put it into profit practically, be\r\nsupplemented by the careful examination of the hair and the skin, of the\r\nescutcheon, and the udder: of the hair, whether it is short, fine, soft,\r\nand furry; of the skin, whether it is soft and close-grained like a kid\r\nglove, thin, oleaginous, and yellow or golden. For if the hair is harsh,\r\nand long, particularly on the back part of the udder, it will shorten\r\nthe time of giving milk, and indicates a poorer quality. The more oily\r\nor greasy to the feeling the skin of the udder and the perineum is, the\r\nmore it indicates good quality and richness of milk, for the oil or fat\r\nis there, showing it is in the nature of that animal to give butyraceous\r\nmilk. So with the color of the skin, if it is golden it is indicative of\r\nrich milk, and the majority think it will make a finer colored butter.\r\nThere is one point more in judging by the escutcheon, and that is its\r\nsize and position, and the general rule is, the higher up it is on the\r\nthighs, and the broader it is on the thighs, together with the higher\r\nand broader it is on the perineum, even up to the vulva, then the better\r\nit is. Then remember the escutcheon has two principal parts, called\r\nthe thigh escutcheon and the vertical escutcheon; the thigh escutcheon\r\nextends over the udder and the thighs; and the vertical is over the\r\nperineum or that part of the posterior which extends from the udder up to\r\nthe tail and above the vulva.\r\n\r\nIf the thigh escutcheon is high and broad, therefore very large, and\r\nextends far outward on to the thighs, it indicates a large flow of\r\nmilk. If the vertical or upper part is broad and smooth, it indicates a\r\nprolonged flow of milk.\r\n\r\nIf the thigh or lower portion of the escutcheon is narrow, the flow will\r\nbe proportionally small. If the vertical or upper part is narrow and\r\nirregular, it is unfavorable to a prolonged flow.\r\n\r\nChalkley Harvey says further of these marks: “Imperfections, that is\r\nblemishes of form, occur in considerable variety on both large and small\r\nescutcheons. They are all certain evidence of a diminished value of the\r\ncow as a milker. A small and imperfect escutcheon on a good cow, is\r\nsomething I have never yet seen. Any want of symmetry in the form of an\r\nescutcheon is an imperfection. The two sides should be alike. A small but\r\nperfect escutcheon may be better than a larger one that is imperfect. A\r\nvery good one is both large and perfect.\r\n\r\n“Thus far we have considered the escutcheon in reference to its form and\r\nsize alone, and may now say, that the quantity of milk depends on these,\r\nbut its quality is indicated by other signs, which we find to a great\r\nextent in the same place. It is too well known to require any assertion,\r\nthat some cows give a large quantity of very poor milk, and others an\r\nequally large quantity of rich milk. It is equally well known that some\r\ncows give but little milk, though they yield a good quantity of butter;\r\nand I repeat, that the signs indicative of these differences of quality\r\nare found in the escutcheon, and they are easily recognized. If the skin\r\nin the escutcheon is soft and oily, and particularly if it is of a rich\r\nyellow color, (though this is more easily seen by examining the end of\r\nthe tail,) suggestive of “gilt edged” butter, that cow will give good\r\nmilk. In such cases we will find her hair soft and short. There may be\r\nsome long hairs, too, but the undergrowth will be as mentioned, and often\r\nhas almost the quality of fur. But if, on the other hand, the skin is\r\nwhite and dry, and the hair thin and harsh, the cow gives poor milk. If\r\nher escutcheon is large and symmetrical, she may give a large quantity of\r\npoor milk. The form and size of the escutcheon indicate _quantity_, the\r\nskin and hair indicate _quality_. These signs are true also as applied\r\nto bulls, being in such cases a proper guide in the selection of animals\r\nto breed milkers from. My own experience and observation, which has been\r\nconsiderable in the matter, convinces me that cows inherit their milking\r\nqualities more from their sires than from their dams; and it is probable\r\nthat many who have been disappointed in heifers raised from some favorite\r\nmilkers, will be disposed to agree with me. If this be true, then the\r\nGuenon method has an application that must prove valuable to those who\r\nbreed cows for dairy purposes. Another interesting fact is, that we can\r\ndiscover all the signs on a calf, and are thereby enabled to select with\r\nmuch certainty those that are fit for the dairy, and to reject those that\r\nwould be only a disappointment, if raised for that purpose. Of course, a\r\nvery small cow, with ever so good an escutcheon, cannot be expected to\r\ngive a very large quantity of milk, and might be inferior in that respect\r\nto one having a less perfect one, where the animal is of greater size.\r\nBut in such cases, the small cow would give much more in proportion to\r\nthe cost of keeping. In all cases, therefore, the size should be taken\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\n“There is a sign that may be mentioned here, (though it does not properly\r\nbelong to the Guenon system,) which is a very certain evidence that a\r\ncow will give a large quantity of milk, though it expresses nothing in\r\nrelation to quality. It is the large size of the vein running forward\r\nfrom the udder, on the belly, and just under the skin. This is called the\r\nmilk vein, and when it is very large and crooked, and enters the abdomen\r\nthrough a hole that will allow the entrance of a man’s finger, it is, I\r\nrepeat, a sign that the cow will yield a large quantity of milk.\r\n\r\n“The time that a cow will continue to milk after she is with calf, varies\r\nin different cases—some ceasing almost as soon as pregnant, and others\r\nmilking up to calving. Generally the best milkers milk the longest. Hence\r\nit follows, that a good escutcheon usually indicates continued flow as\r\nwell as large quantity. Those escutcheons that are not large at the base,\r\nbut that run up to the vulva symmetrical all the way, and pretty wide,\r\nindicate a yield of milk up to the time of calving.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PERFECT COW—DUCHESS—Imported Jersey, belonging to Chas.\r\nL. Sharpless.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Mode of Judging Stock.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the Guenon system is, that _it is an aid to all other modes\r\nof selecting stock_, and therefore, it gives a decided advantage to the\r\nperson who understands it over the one who does not. For instance, let\r\ntwo buyers go into a herd, and let them be equal judges of stock, one of\r\nthem will be very apt to buy a bastard, while the other one would very\r\npositively leave her alone, simply because the latter has a knowledge\r\nof the best and surest mode of all modes of judging stock. And this\r\nknowledge does not prevent him from using his half a dozen other modes of\r\ndeciding its merits, but aids them. So, too, in selecting a bull for a\r\npropagator, the believer in Guenon will select one with a good escutcheon\r\nand a fine skin, while the other will decide almost entirely by the form.\r\nAnd so with calves, the one who selects calves by the Guenon marks will\r\nbe pretty sure to have a dairy of productive cows, while the other will\r\nhave to dispose of some unprofitable ones. The one makes money, because\r\nhe is working intelligently with every light of science, while the other\r\nis only _guessing_ pretty well.\r\n\r\nWe first look at a cow from the front, and see that she widens as she\r\ngets back to her hips, or is wedge-shaped. Next we look at her side, and\r\nwe again see that she rises on her back and descends on the belly as\r\nshe goes back to the tail, or in other words she is wedge-shaped, too,\r\nfrom this point of view. These two looks at her have enabled us to see\r\nthat she has a feminine appearance; that her head is small and neat in\r\nproportion to her body, with a waxy small horn, a mild but large eye,\r\na broad muzzle, and that it is well set on her neck; that she has a\r\ngood chest, and large deep paunch, with large full ribs, fuller below\r\nand joined to a rather high back bone; that is to say she has not the\r\nbreadth of back we look for in a beef animal. If the chine is double,\r\nit indicates a cow above the average; if the chine is single, sometimes\r\nwe can lay our three fingers in three depressions in it at about the\r\nmiddle of it, showing that she is a loose rangy cow, and fitted for her\r\nwork. Now we will look at her udder and see that it runs forward as level\r\nas possible to the belly, and that it is large, with four good-sized,\r\nwell-shaped teats slightly strutting from each quarter. Now we gently\r\napproach her, and pat her to gain her confidence, and get a chance to\r\nfeel her hide, her milk veins, and examine her escutcheon. If we find\r\nher skin is thin, soft, and greasy, with short fine hair, with rather\r\na furry nature, and showing the skin yellow under it; that her udder\r\nand her perineum have soft thin skin, with very short furry hair; that\r\nher milk veins are large, zig-zag, and knotty, entering the body with\r\ngood-sized holes, and particularly if this vein is double, extending and\r\nramifying over the udder well back in prominent veins, and if the veins\r\nextend over the perineum, we may then, with great confidence, look for a\r\nlarge well-shaped and formed escutcheon, marked first class, order first,\r\nby an oval on each side of the back of the udder, and perhaps two thigh\r\novals or dips where the vertical escutcheon rises from the broad or thigh\r\nescutcheon; and just to finish and find all points corroborating, we will\r\nlook on the vertical escutcheon for some spots of oily lemon colored\r\ndandruff, and at the end of her neat, lightly made tail to find some\r\nlarge yellow pieces of dandruff. We don’t like to see it dry and brown;\r\nand as we step back from her, we just give a parting look to see that her\r\nhips are rather large, bony, somewhat drooping, that her capacious udder\r\nhas room to project between her legs.\r\n\r\nThen, we feel sure that a loose, open made cow, rather pointed, or sharp\r\nand well-defined, and the contrary of what we would look for in a flesh\r\nor beef producing animal; with a skin mellow and yellow, covered with\r\nsoft, fine hair, and the nearer it comes to the quality and color of a\r\nfirst class Guernsey or Jersey cow, breeds which have for hundreds of\r\nyears been bred for butter making, then we repeat we know she must be a\r\ngood, rich milker and butter maker; for we never saw a thick, hard skin\r\ncow, with coarse, long hair, that was a good butter maker, or fit for\r\nanything but giving poor milk, _if_ a strong milker.\r\n\r\nOur preference is for a medium sized cow, one that will dress five\r\nhundred and fifty or six hundred pounds; and, as far as our observation\r\ngoes, a Jersey sire, with an Ayrshire dam, is the best cross for a milk\r\nand butter cow, and the most profitable for the amount of food consumed;\r\nthough a Jersey or Guernsey sire to the milking stock of Durhams, or a\r\nHolstein, or a large yielding native cow, will produce a better cow for\r\nbutter than the mother was.\r\n\r\nTo get thorough practice in valuing the escutcheon, take this book in\r\nhand, and go into your dairy-yard; compare the escutcheon of each cow\r\nwith her picture in this book; see what it calls for time and quantity,\r\nand then thoroughly test your cow; don’t guess at it, as most farmers\r\ndo; and make your own comparisons. Remember the size and class of the\r\nescutcheon will give you _the quantity and time_; the skin and hair will\r\ngive you _the quality_; and always remembering the size of the cow, and\r\nof what breed she is, for they must qualify your opinion somewhat.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinions of the System.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Country Gentleman_ of July 17, 1879, S. Hoxie, of\r\nWhitestown, New York, so thoroughly expresses our experience and\r\nconvictions, that we are led to quote it:\r\n\r\n“The writer has been acquainted with ‘the escutcheon theory’ ever since\r\nabout 1850. During this time he has been a practical dairyman in central\r\nNew York. At first he approached the study of the escutcheon as a\r\ndoubter. It seemed to him an absolute absurdity to claim a connection\r\nbetween the growing of the hair and the production of milk, two functions\r\nso entirely different.\r\n\r\n“At first he examined the herd of cows which he helped milk every night\r\nand morning, and was surprised to meet with so many proofs of the truth\r\nof the theory. He then observed it upon other herds, and finally extended\r\nhis observations to various breeds under various circumstances. He was at\r\nlast compelled to come to the final conclusion that the theory, in the\r\nmain, was true, but that other points and conditions of the animal must\r\nbe understood in order invariably to reach a correct judgment:\r\n\r\n“1. The breed modifies the quantity and quality of milk production. This\r\nis so manifestly true that it needs no argument. A particular order\r\nand class of escutcheon indicates a different quantity and a different\r\nquality of milk on a Jersey than it indicates on an Ayrshire cow.\r\n\r\n“2. The condition of care and feed to which different families of\r\nthe same breed have been accustomed during long periods modify milk\r\nproduction, and must be taken into consideration. For instance, certain\r\nfamilies of Short-Horns have been cared for and fed through several\r\ngenerations with the sole view of beef production; other families have\r\nbeen trained to milk production. Escutcheons upon the former indicate far\r\nless quantity of milk than upon the latter. Thus some families with very\r\nfine escutcheons give very little milk. The escutcheons in such cases\r\nno doubt indicate an original capacity that a few generations of proper\r\ntreatment might awaken and develop.\r\n\r\n“3. The capacity and health of the digestive organs modifies the\r\nquantity, and we also think the quality, of milk production. Cows with\r\nlarge, healthy digestive organs will eat and properly digest more food,\r\nand give good return at the pail, than one with opposite conditions of\r\nthe digestive organs. The former may sometimes give the larger quantity\r\nof milk, though, indeed, possessed of the poorer escutcheon.\r\n\r\n“4. The activity of the nervous system materially affects milk\r\nproduction. This is often seen when the animal is unduly excited. The\r\nquiet dispositioned cow that attends to feeding, and is not disturbed by\r\nany excitement in the herd or in the surrounding fields, may have the\r\npoorer escutcheon, yet give larger quantities of milk than the extremely\r\nexcitable cow, with the better escutcheon.\r\n\r\n“Other conditions will suggest themselves to the observing and reflecting\r\nman, that materially affect the quantity and quality of milk production.\r\n\r\n“These modifying conditions do not disturb the true theory of the\r\nescutcheon. _Other things being equal, the escutcheon is indicative\r\nof the quantity and quality of milk._ Many are misled in estimating\r\nthe value of the escutcheon, because they have not the patience or the\r\ncapacity to observe the varying conditions. The escutcheon is of immense\r\npractical value. It is easily seen the conditions of flesh do not\r\nchange it, and animals of all ages, above three months, may be examined\r\nby it, and their milking qualities determined with a good degree of\r\naccuracy. Other things being equal, the animal with the better escutcheon\r\nwill invariably make the butter maker. During nearly thirty years of\r\nobservation, the writer never observed a first class cow that had a\r\npoor escutcheon. The escutcheon must be of great value to those who are\r\nbreeding, and endeavouring to improve thorough-bred cattle of the various\r\nmilking breeds. It offers a test that may be applied before milking\r\nage, and it may be applied to males as well as females. _Though the\r\npedigree is ever so long, and though it contains many good ancestors, the\r\nanimal should be rejected from the breeding herd, unless it has a good\r\nescutcheon._”\r\n\r\n“One of the Farmers,” a regular correspondent of the _American\r\nAgriculturist_, writes in the number for November, 1878:\r\n\r\n“THE VALUE OF THE GUENON MILK MIRROR.—Taken with a good udder and\r\nmilk-veins, good digestive functions, and capacity for food, good health\r\nand thrift, the Guenon milk mirror is a valuable indication of both the\r\nquantity and duration of the flow of milk. This seems to be demonstrated\r\nby the experience of thousands who have given the subject careful\r\nstudy, and I have never yet met the man who ridiculed it, and called it\r\n“folly,” who was able intelligently even to outline the prominent types.\r\nThe number of calves which do well or ill as milkers, very nearly as\r\nindicated by their milk mirrors, is so large, that one of the principal\r\npractical uses to which a knowledge of the Guenon system can be applied\r\nis in selecting calves to raise, and, of course, to those who buy cows,\r\nit comes equally well in use.”\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF BREEDERS OF DUTCH FRIESIAN CATTLE, composed\r\nof some of the most practical and intelligent farmers of the dairy region\r\nof central New York, have adopted a new set of rules for entry into\r\nregistry in their Herd Book, wisely making the performance at the pail\r\none of the necessary requirements. Thus, for a period of not more than\r\ntwelve months from date of calving, the cow under 2½ years of age must\r\ngive 6,000 lbs. of milk; over 2½, and under 3½, 7,000 lbs; over 3½, and\r\nunder 4½, 8,000 lbs; over 4½, 9,000 lbs; also, rule 8: No animal shall\r\nbe admitted to registry unless of the “milk form,” or of the “combined\r\nmilk and beef form,” of medium or of large size, without coarseness,\r\nand if a female, having a well developed escutcheon, not below the 4th\r\norder of the 1st class, the 3d orders of the 2d, 3d 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,\r\nand 8th classes, the 2d order of the 9th class, or the 1st order of the\r\n10th class of the Pennsylvania Commission. With such a record, and with\r\nsuch marks, no one need take the trouble to see the stock, but may safely\r\norder it, knowing exactly what they are to receive.\r\n\r\nGeorge E. Waring, junior, says:\r\n\r\n    “If the escutcheon teaches anything it teaches _the duration\r\n    of the flow of milk_. This is its great value in connection\r\n    with the Jerseys—a race of small, rich, and _persistent_\r\n    milkers. It does indicate quantity, it is true, but not Dutch\r\n    quantity, nor Ayrshire quantity; only _Jersey_ quantity, which\r\n    is quite another affair. It indicates, in at least equal\r\n    degree, the continuance of the flow of milk. Indeed, this is\r\n    the great value of Guenon’s discovery. It is easy to judge of\r\n    the _present_ flow of milk in the case of any given cow, but,\r\n    so far as I know, there is nothing but the escutcheon to tell\r\n    us how long she will continue to milk after getting with calf.\r\n    If she has a _first class_ escutcheon, I think we are safe in\r\n    believing that she will hold out well in her milking. If she\r\n    has a very defective escutcheon, we may depend on her to fall\r\n    away very rapidly when a few months gone, and to shut down\r\n    entirely three or four months before calving.”\r\n\r\nFrom an exhaustive and admirable treatise on the Ayrshire breed, by John\r\nD. W. French, of North Andover, Mass., we make the following extracts\r\nfrom his remarks on the Guenon system:\r\n\r\n    “Pabst, a German farmer of large experience, with a view\r\n    to simplify the method of Guenon, and render it of greater\r\n    practical value, made five divisions, or classes:—\r\n\r\n        1. Very good, or extraordinary.\r\n        2. Good, or good middling.\r\n        3. Middling, and little below middling.\r\n        4. Small.\r\n        5. Very bad milkers.\r\n\r\n    “Magne, the French writer, made a still further simplification,\r\n    by making four classes instead of five:—\r\n\r\n        1. The very good.\r\n        2. The good.\r\n        3. The medium.\r\n        4. The bad.\r\n\r\n    “In the first class he places cows, both parts of whose\r\n    milk-mirror, the mammary and the perinean, are large,\r\n    continuous, uniform, covering at least a great part of the\r\n    perineum, the udder, the inner surface of the thighs, and\r\n    extending more or less out upon the legs with no interruptions,\r\n    or, if any, small ones, oval in form, and situated on the\r\n    posterior face of the udder. Cows of this class are very rare.\r\n    They give, even when small in size, from ten to fourteen quarts\r\n    per day, and the largest size from eighteen to twenty-six\r\n    quarts a day, and even more. They continue in milk for a long\r\n    period.\r\n\r\n    “The second class is that of good cows, and to this belong\r\n    the best commonly found in the market. They have the mammary\r\n    part of the milk-mirror well developed, but the perinean part\r\n    contracted or wholly wanting. Small cows of this class give\r\n    from seven to ten or eleven quarts a day, and the largest from\r\n    thirteen to seventeen quarts.\r\n\r\n    “The third class consists of middling cows. When the\r\n    milk-mirror really presents only the lower or mammary part\r\n    slightly developed or indented, and the perinean part\r\n    contracted, narrow, and irregular, the cows are middling. Cows\r\n    of this class, according to size, give from three or four to\r\n    ten quarts per day.\r\n\r\n    “The fourth class is composed of bad cows. No veins are to\r\n    be seen either on the perineum or the udder, while those of\r\n    the belly are very slightly developed, and the mirrors are\r\n    ordinarily small. These cows give only a few quarts of milk a\r\n    day, and dry up a short time after calving.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. C. L. Flint, in his work on ‘Milch Cows,’ says:—\r\n\r\n        “These classifications, adopted by Pabst, Magne, and\r\n        others, appear to be far more simple and satisfactory than\r\n        the more complicated classification of Guenon. Without\r\n        pretending to judge with accuracy of the quantity, the\r\n        quality, or the duration which a particular size or form\r\n        of the mirror will indicate, they give to Guenon the full\r\n        credit of his important discovery, as a new and valuable\r\n        element in forming our judgment of the milking qualities\r\n        of a cow, and simply assert, with respect to the duration\r\n        of the flow of milk, that the mirror that indicates the\r\n        greatest quantity will also indicate the longest duration.\r\n\r\n        “My own attention was called to Guenon’s method of judging\r\n        cows some eight or ten years ago, and since that time I\r\n        have examined many hundreds, with a view to ascertain the\r\n        correctness of its main features, inquiring, at the same\r\n        time, after the views and opinions of the best breeders\r\n        and judges of stock, with regard to their experience and\r\n        judgment of its merits; and the result of my observations\r\n        has been that cows with the most perfectly developed\r\n        milk-mirrors or escutcheons are, with rare exceptions, the\r\n        best milkers of their breed, and that cows with small and\r\n        slightly developed mirrors are, in the majority of cases,\r\n        bad milkers.\r\n\r\n        “I say the best milkers of _their breed_, for I do\r\n        not believe that precisely the same sized and formed\r\n        milk-mirrors on a Hereford, or a Devon and an Ayrshire, or\r\n        a native, will indicate anything like the same or equal\r\n        milking properties. It will not do, in my opinion, to\r\n        disregard the general and well-known characteristics of the\r\n        breed, and rely wholly on the milk-mirror; but I think it\r\n        may be safely said that, as a general rule, the best marked\r\n        Hereford will turn out to be the best milker among the\r\n        Herefords, all of which are poor milkers; the best marked\r\n        Devon, the best among the Devons; and the best marked\r\n        Ayrshire, the best among the Ayrshires; that is, it will\r\n        not do to compare two animals of entirely distinct breeds\r\n        by the milk-mirrors alone, without regard to the fixed\r\n        habits and education, so to speak, of the breed or family\r\n        to which they belong.”\r\n\r\n    “In my own herd of Ayrshire cows, the largest milkers have\r\n    the best escutcheons, and these cows have, in most cases,\r\n    transmitted these marks to their descendants. On the other\r\n    hand, the cows with medium or poor escutcheons have rarely\r\n    transmitted to their calves better ones; but, generally, of the\r\n    same or lower class than the dams.\r\n\r\n    “BULLS.—Guenon’s second and hardly less important discovery\r\n    was that the bull had the same marks as the cow, only somewhat\r\n    shorter and narrower. Guenon bestows upon these marks the same\r\n    name, ‘milk-mirror,’ which may be justified, in as far as the\r\n    bull has greater influence upon the sustaining or obtaining of\r\n    an abundant yield of milk, as well as the improvement of the\r\n    breed.\r\n\r\n    “SOME TESTIMONY.—Mr. L. A. Hansen, of Bay St. Louis, writes, in\r\n    a letter to the _Country Gentleman_:\r\n\r\n        “I served my apprenticeship for three years on a dairy\r\n        farm with two hundred cows, performing all the labor\r\n        appertaining to a farm, the same as one of the hired men.\r\n        After this, for twenty years, I had dairies of from eighty\r\n        to one hundred and seventy cows. Living in the best dairy\r\n        country then known, and our butter commanding the very\r\n        highest market prices in London, England, (taking the\r\n        premium at a butter exhibition in London,) we considered it\r\n        the best policy to buy our cows instead of raising them,\r\n        and I consequently had to purchase from twenty to thirty\r\n        cows every year. Having adopted the Guenon system as a\r\n        helping guide in my purchases, I necessarily examined more\r\n        than a hundred cows annually, besides having under daily\r\n        observation my own cows and those of the neighboring dairy\r\n        farms. Thus, I had continual practice through a number of\r\n        years. The classifications of the professor, mentioned in\r\n        my former article, were, with very rare exceptions, right.\r\n        In the first two classes, they did not fail once; in the\r\n        lower classes, more frequently; but as the lower classes,\r\n        with their sub-division, are of no importance to the\r\n        dairyman—only the two first being fit for a dairy—the study\r\n        of them becomes unnecessary, and it is of little avail if\r\n        they are minutely correct.\r\n\r\n        “As nothing in this world is perfect, we cannot reasonably\r\n        expect the Guenon system to be without defects; but, as\r\n        already stated above, the imperfection is to be looked for\r\n        in that part which is immaterial for practical application.\r\n        Under all circumstances, _as far as my experience goes,\r\n        the Guenon theory will always remain a valuable guide in\r\n        selecting milk cows_.”\r\n\r\n    “Mr. L. S. Hardin writes, in a prize essay:\r\n\r\n        “Very few, if any, modern writers upon cattle have accepted\r\n        the complicated theory of Guenon, while no two of them\r\n        agree as to the extent in value of the escutcheon. As\r\n        a point of beauty, it should certainly be cultivated\r\n        in the herd. As to its practical value for indicating\r\n        the milking qualities of the cow, my experience is that\r\n        a finely-developed escutcheon is rarely seen on a poor\r\n        milker, while many excellent milkers have very small or\r\n        no escutcheons at all. In other words, its presence is a\r\n        good sign, while its absence is not necessarily a cause\r\n        for distrust. Milk-veins, as an indication for milking\r\n        capacity, are of about the same value as the escutcheon.”\r\n\r\n    “The editor of the _Jersey Bulletin_, in commenting on this,\r\n    says:\r\n\r\n        “We should be very glad to know of a cow, worthy to be\r\n        called an ‘excellent milker’—duration of the flow after\r\n        becoming pregnant being one of the tests—which has no\r\n        escutcheon at all, or a very small one. As at present\r\n        advised, we don’t believe she exists. Most old cow men\r\n        would say that, if the escutcheon is as valuable an\r\n        indication as the milk-veins, too much effort can hardly be\r\n        made to extend knowledge concerning it.”\r\n\r\n    “Henry Tanner, professor of agriculture, Queen’s College,\r\n    Birmingham, England, says, in a volume of prize essays of the\r\n    Highland and Agricultural Society:\r\n\r\n        “Some attention has also been given, within a few years,\r\n        to a discovery, made by Mons. Guenon, respecting ‘the\r\n        escutcheon,’ as it is termed. Like many other persons,\r\n        he was carried beyond the boundary of discretion in his\r\n        speculations, and thus his valuable observations were for\r\n        a time lost in the mist with which he enveloped them.\r\n        Sufficient is already known of its value, at least, to lead\r\n        us to the conclusion that it is worthy of more general\r\n        knowledge.\r\n\r\n        “A very extended observation has proved that, other\r\n        conditions being equal, the modification of form presented\r\n        by the escutcheon will lead to an estimation, not only of\r\n        the quantity of milk which the animal will produce, but\r\n        also of the time during which the cow will keep up the\r\n        supply of milk.\r\n\r\n        “Without going into detail upon this point, I may briefly\r\n        state that the larger the extent of the escutcheon,\r\n        the greater is the promise of milk, and also of its\r\n        continuance, even after the cow is again in calf. A cow\r\n        may have a small escutcheon, and yet be a good milker; but\r\n        observation leads to the conclusion that, if she possessed\r\n        a more fully developed escutcheon, she would have been a\r\n        better milker. It may be considered a point of merit, not\r\n        as deciding whether or not the cow is a good milker, but\r\n        rather as an additional indication which may be taken into\r\n        consideration in conjunction with other characteristic\r\n        points. It is also desirable, in estimating the extent of\r\n        the escutcheon, to make full allowance for the folds in\r\n        the skin; otherwise, a large escutcheon may be taken for a\r\n        small one. Besides the escutcheon, there are tufts of hair\r\n        (epis) which have a certain degree of value when seen upon\r\n        the udder of the cow.”\r\n\r\n    “I presume there are many men who, although perhaps not caring\r\n    a pin for an escutcheon, yet consider themselves fully capable\r\n    of selecting a good milk cow. Now, although ignoring the\r\n    escutcheon in their judgment, are they not apt, in selecting\r\n    an ideal cow of any particular milk breed, to find a good\r\n    escutcheon developed of one class or another?\r\n\r\n    “Perhaps it may be asked, if the Guenon system is a true one,\r\n    why are not the Short-Horns a great milk breed, for in them we\r\n    often find very large and perfect escutcheons?\r\n\r\n    “This question may be answered as follows: The Short-Horns\r\n    were originally a good milking breed; but, having been\r\n    made particularly a beef breed, the milking propensity or\r\n    mammary system has in most families been changed or bred out.\r\n    Notwithstanding this change, they may retain the escutcheon,\r\n    not as a mark of quality, but as one of the characteristic\r\n    marks of the breed.\r\n\r\n    “All farmers are aware that a first-class milk cow may, by\r\n    injudicious feed and treatment, especially as regards milking,\r\n    become a second-class animal. Now, such a system, carried out\r\n    generation after generation, must certainly degenerate a milk\r\n    breed, however good their marks and quality.\r\n\r\n    “Among the Short-Horns, probably the best milkers have good\r\n    escutcheons; but an Ayrshire cow, with an inferior escutcheon,\r\n    might be found to give more milk than a Short-Horn with a\r\n    superior escutcheon, simply because one breed has been bred\r\n    especially for beef, the other especially for milk.\r\n\r\n    “To show how breeding for a purpose through many generations\r\n    may ultimately change qualities, let us compare the Short-Horns\r\n    with the Dutch or Holsteins. The early Short-Horns, or the\r\n    Teeswater breed, as it was called, was of Dutch origin, or\r\n    was certainly formed by crossing the native cattle of England\r\n    with stock imported from Holland. This breed was originally\r\n    considered remarkable for its milking qualities.\r\n\r\n    “The Dutch breed, bred for generations for the especial purpose\r\n    of milk, is to-day noted for large milkers, and among the cows\r\n    may be found extraordinarily developed escutcheons.\r\n\r\n    “The following extract, from a translation from the French of\r\n    Magne on milk cows, is _apropos_, as showing the difference\r\n    between characteristics of breeds and qualities of the animals:\r\n\r\n        “A long, fine head, narrow towards the horns, and a slender\r\n        chest are given by most writers as characteristics of a\r\n        good milk cow. Now, in Flemish, Danish, Dutch, and Brittany\r\n        cows the fineness of head and chest is a characteristic\r\n        of these races and not the indication of particularly\r\n        developed milking qualities, being met with alike in the\r\n        good and bad milkers of those races; whilst in some of\r\n        the Swiss breeds, and especially in those of St. Gervais,\r\n        nearly all the cows, whether good or indifferent, possess\r\n        a large head and heavy chest. The farmers of Ariege, while\r\n        showing us some remarkably good cows, drew our attention\r\n        to their strength of chest, ampleness of the dewlap, and\r\n        the volume of the head: these characteristics of race they\r\n        mistake for qualities, observing them in their best cows.\r\n        On the other hand, it is to be remarked that cows with fine\r\n        heads are often inferior milkers. If fineness of head were\r\n        a true proof of mammillary activity, would not the cows of\r\n        the Durham breed be amongst the best dairy animals in the\r\n        world? This characteristic cannot, therefore, be considered\r\n        absolutely appreciable, as much depends on the race to\r\n        which a cow may belong. It is indicative of milk only,\r\n        because it is a remarkable point in those races which have\r\n        produced milk cows. Thus a characteristic of race has been\r\n        mistaken for a sign of particular qualities.”\r\n\r\n    “If, then, we should regard the escutcheon, as well as a fine\r\n    head, one of the characteristics common in the Short-Horn,\r\n    it is not necessary to consider it as an indication of any\r\n    particularly developed quality. Although probably the best\r\n    milkers would have this sign, yet it might be regarded as\r\n    a latent sign of milking qualities which had been bred out\r\n    by disuse. The only fair way to judge of the value of the\r\n    escutcheon in determining milking qualities, is to consider its\r\n    influence in the different breeds separately, not comparing\r\n    one breed with another. In judging grade cows, characteristics\r\n    and blood must have a certain influence on the judgment. The\r\n    general type of the animal must be considered.\r\n\r\n    “In the Ayrshire cow, we must regard the escutcheon, not as a\r\n    special characteristic of the breed, but as one of the signs\r\n    denoting quality.\r\n\r\n    “If the time should come when it has become so universal a sign\r\n    of quality as to be considered a characteristic of the breed,\r\n    then we shall have approached much nearer perfection than at\r\n    present.\r\n\r\n    “Admitting that the escutcheon theory is a failure, or at least\r\n    that it has failed as a test-mark of milk, have we any other\r\n    mark or series of marks that have invariably given better\r\n    results?\r\n\r\n    “Magne says, that in Flanders, a cow is considered a good\r\n    milker, ‘especially when towards the middle of the spine the\r\n    apophyses (or projections) are separated or scattered so as\r\n    to leave a space between of about two finger-breadths,’ for\r\n    the reason that, when the spine is thus formed, the haunches\r\n    are better spread, and the thighs and croup larger. The other\r\n    members of the body are also better developed, the basin is\r\n    ampler, and the organs placed in this cavity, as well as the\r\n    udder, are more voluminous.\r\n\r\n    “Now, would our dairymen consider this a more certain\r\n    indication of milk, than a good escutcheon?\r\n\r\n    “Without regarding the escutcheon as an infallible sign of\r\n    quality and quantity of milk, I believe it to be one of the\r\n    best indications of milk, that nature has provided; but in the\r\n    use of this system, we must consider:—\r\n\r\n        1. The breed.\r\n        2. The age.\r\n        3. The feed.\r\n        4. The treatment (present and past.)\r\n        5. The health.\r\n\r\n    “A good, not to say a thorough, understanding of the Guenon\r\n    system, cannot be obtained by casual observation, but only by\r\n    the most painstaking examination of many animals, extending\r\n    over a long period of time.”\r\n\r\n\r\nObjections to the System and to the Report of the Commission.\r\n\r\nM. Guenon in his Treatise on Milk Cows, does not give any positive\r\nreasons why the escutcheon is indicative of the yield. He rested content\r\nwith the fact, that he had proved it so before many learned men, and\r\nrisked his reputation upon publishing the facts. The system as far as we\r\nhave been able to trace it, has always been verified by those who have\r\n_thoroughly studied it, and tested it by extended practice according to\r\nthe rules of Guenon_. The principal cavilers against it, either admit\r\nthey have not constantly pursued it, or show by their writings their lack\r\nof sufficient knowledge of it. The report of the Pennsylvania commission\r\nhas incited several to write against the system. The principal paper\r\nproduced was one read before a meeting of the State Board of Agriculture,\r\nby Eastburn Reeder, and which he had reprinted in several papers. Of\r\nthis essay, it is sufficient to say, he showed he had not studied nor\r\npracticed the system thoroughly, and because he could not understand it\r\nand got befogged, he quoted a large mass of scientific matter to show\r\nthe system could not be true. These attempts at argument are so quietly,\r\nbut completely, set aside in the essay of Prof. D. E. Salmon, D. V. M.,\r\non Contested Dairy Questions, quoted below, that we shall not discuss\r\nthem further. For we cannot any more tell _absolutely and positively_ why\r\nthe escutcheon reveals what it does, than we can tell why a _black_ cow\r\neating _green_ grass, converts _red_ blood into _white_ milk, than we can\r\ntell _why_ the green grass grows. In both questions at issue, we have\r\ncertain facts and theories to guide our reason and judgment about them,\r\nbut we know nothing _positive_, and because it is so, Mr. Reeder and Mr.\r\nHardin won’t believe it is so or can be so.\r\n\r\nIn addition to what Mons. Magne, the eminent French veterinarian, one of\r\nthe most celebrated medical professors in France has written, Professor\r\nArnold, of Rochester says, when indorsing what Magne writes:\r\n\r\n    “The size of the escutcheon is regarded as the measure of the\r\n    quantity of blood supplied to the milk-producing vessels, and\r\n    are evidence of their capability of elaborating milk. In the\r\n    same way, the veins take up the blood, and carry it back in the\r\n    milk veins which pass through the bag and along the belly, and\r\n    enter the body through one or more holes, on their way to the\r\n    heart. The size of these milk veins, and the holes where they\r\n    enter the body, vary with the escutcheon, and like it, give\r\n    evidence of the quantity of venous blood passing away, from and\r\n    through the udder, and they have the same significance with\r\n    reference to quantity, as the supply of arterial blood and the\r\n    size of the escutcheon.”\r\n\r\nMr. Reeder also quotes the weights of cattle given by Guenon, and\r\ntriumphantly exclaims, whoever saw such small cows in this country?\r\nGuenon distinctly quotes the weights, as net dead weight, or the animal\r\ndeprived of its head and horns, its hide, entrails, and feet, and gives\r\nthe excellent reason for it when he says: “If I had made the calculations\r\nfor the animal on the hoof, the figures given by me would present a\r\ngreat difference, which would increase according to the amount of fat,\r\nsometimes to double the weight.” Unfortunately, Mr. Reeder did not\r\nknow enough of Guenon’s facts to be aware of this clear statement, and\r\nsupposed the weights were live weight.\r\n\r\nAgain, he says the commission did not examine the stock correctly. _He_\r\nwould have looked at an animal, decided what escutcheon it had, or “to\r\nwhich class and order she belongs, and then append the figures of Guenon\r\nas the result. Any other mode of proceeding is not testing the Guenon\r\nsystem.” Here again his lack of knowledge of the system is shown; it\r\nwould be exceedingly unjust to the reputation of Guenon, as he distinctly\r\ndeclares the size, the age, the breed, the treatment, the season, the\r\nperiod of gestation, &c., shall be fully considered. It is the judgment\r\nof just such men passed upon the system, which have tended to throw any\r\ndoubt upon the merit of Guenon’s assertions. What would be thought of the\r\njudgment of such a person, if told by a physician to administer three\r\nthings to a patient, and he gave but one, and the patient died, and he\r\nexcused himself by saying, “you told me to give him medicine, and I gave\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Reeder denies the value of the system for pointing out the best\r\n_feeders_. The cow which gives the most butter, and which this system\r\nwill readily point out, will fatten the most rapidly when dried off; for\r\nthe butyraceous particles, which go to make the butter, will be diverted\r\nfrom the milk and turn to fat on the animal.\r\n\r\nMr. Reeder objects to the report of the commission, that they “in some\r\ncases failed to classify cows,” and “made incorrect classifications,”\r\nand “in some cases gave different results from Guenon,” and lastly “the\r\nterms employed to denote quantity, quality, and duration, are too vague,\r\nindefinite, and unsatisfactory.” In all these objections, Mr. R., it will\r\nbe readily seen by any practicer of the system, shows his utter ignorance\r\nof the mode of applying it.\r\n\r\nGuenon says it is sometimes impossible to properly classify an animal,\r\nowing to the effects of a cross, or some freak of nature. In such cases\r\nthey may be judged according to the escutcheon it the nearest resembles.\r\nThis the commission did, but of course could not classify them.\r\n\r\nHis judgment as to “incorrect classifications” we must pass by as of no\r\naccount, he not being any more capable of that than the commission.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of “giving different results from Guenon.” That is\r\nentirely a matter of judgment. Guenon says, judge of the cow by various\r\nthings and then the result will approximate the amount stated to each\r\nescutcheon. Mr. Reeder says the amount set down to each escutcheon is\r\ninflexible. We prefer to follow the skill of Guenon and not the ignorance\r\nof Reeder, as it was Guenon we were appointed to test.\r\n\r\nFinally, he objects to the terms employed to denote the significance\r\nof the escutcheon. The great difficulty of the commission was to find\r\nherds of which an accurate test of each animal had been made and kept.\r\nWe believe not one farmer in one hundred thousand has such a record. Yet\r\nthe commission are expected by such “infallible” advocates as Mr. R. to\r\ntell the exact character of each cow, and that record is to be set down\r\nalongside of the inaccurate record of the owner; and if they vary at all,\r\nthe commission are the ones at fault. The very terms Mr. R. objects to\r\nwere employed by us by special agreement with the owners, because they\r\nhesitated to say how many quarts or pounds each of their cows gave. But\r\nwhere there were such careful farmers as W. M. Large, M. Eastburn, J.\r\nPyle, and M. Conard, who gave quarts, and the commission gave quarts, we\r\nwould invite attention to the comparative reports as the best answer.\r\nAnd even in Mr. R.’s own case we ask comparison, for the reason why the\r\ncommission are on most of his cows one or two quarts higher is easily\r\naccounted for, because we did not learn until after the examination that\r\nhe was generally ranked by his neighbors a poor feeder, which would\r\ncertainly make the difference. In the cases of such fine herds as those\r\nof S. J. Sharpless, Thomas M. Harvey, Thomas Gawthrop, and H. Preston,\r\n&c., the accounts were highly satisfactory to their owners and confirmed\r\nthem in the merits of the system. For the same reasons we object to _his_\r\ntest of “the system in other herds” as any proof of the merits of Guenon,\r\nfor it was his interpretation of the escutcheons that is given, and it\r\nwould be very unfair to judge Guenon as interpreted by one who is not an\r\nexpert.\r\n\r\nMr. Hardin has written much against the system, but containing very\r\nlittle argument, and no valid objection. We will endeavor to sift out of\r\nthe mass, any points made:\r\n\r\nHe thought there should be one “non-believer” on the commission, so as\r\nto “make a fair and disinterested report.” What possible use he may have\r\nbeen is a mystery, except to cavil at what perhaps he did not understand.\r\nThe commission simply put down what they interpreted the escutcheons\r\nto indicate, and the owner stated what he knew of his stock. The two\r\naccounts were brought together and compared. What more a non-believer\r\ncould have done, we are at a loss to conceive.\r\n\r\nHis process of examination was laid down thus: “To take down in writing\r\n_before you see the cows_, the owners’ and milkers’ opinions of all the\r\ncows to be tested.” “Make the owners and milkers, _out of hearing of each\r\nother_, tell you the name of the cow, her age, how much milk she gives\r\nwhen fresh, how much milk she gives a year, is her milk rich or poor;\r\nhave you ever tested the milk by measure, or otherwise to determine the\r\namount or its richness; what breed is she?” “Get a non-believer to make\r\npencil sketches of each escutcheon.” “The Governor to appoint two more on\r\nthe committee who are not believers.”\r\n\r\nNow, having laid out this programme, he does not say what was to be\r\ndone with it. The inference was to be drawn, we suppose, that the many\r\nescutcheons were to be engraved, and the public were to draw their\r\nconclusions from them and the reports given by the owners and milkers,\r\nand see how Guenon would stand the test. And what were the believing or\r\nnon-believing commissioners to do? Supervise the taking down of all this?\r\nHow, at once, this shows Mr. Hardin to know little or nothing of the\r\nsystem! Like Mr. Reeder, he did not know that Guenon assigns many other\r\nthings to be thought of to form a correct opinion! Was it more proof to\r\nbe told by the owner all that any one could know about the cow, and then\r\nsay that corresponds with the escutcheon? Or did it put the system to a\r\nseverer test, to say to the owner, don’t tell me a word, and then proceed\r\nto tell him all about a cow you never saw, simply from examining her\r\nescutcheon? In one case, you are assisted to define the escutcheon by the\r\nknowledge given you. In the other case, you define the cow’s character by\r\nonly the knowledge you can get from the escutcheon. No better proof can\r\nbe given of Mr. Hardin’s lack of practical knowledge of the system.\r\n\r\nAnother objection he makes, and repeats several times, as being a\r\nvery strong one with him, is, why did not Guenon, and why do not the\r\ncommissioners, go to work and buy up all the best cows and sell them at\r\na profit, and thus get very rich. His cry is, why don’t they make plenty\r\nof money out of it, if it is so valuable? Simply, because neither of them\r\nare in that business, or care to be. But Mr. Harvey, a manager of the\r\nDelaware county almshouse, in one year from taking this position, changed\r\nthe cows there, and increased the yield twofold from the same number of\r\ncows, and has bought and sold all the steers and cows on his large farm\r\nfor many years solely by this system, and _has_ grown wealthy.\r\n\r\nHe says in another article “feeling the modesty that naturally attaches\r\nitself to benighted ignorance,” he “started out in the city in search of\r\nsome one who was learned on these subjects.” He found “a professor in\r\nour medical institute,” “one of our most learned physicians,” and they\r\nproceed together to canvass Professors Magne and Arnold’s theories and\r\nfacts about the formation of the escutcheon. The result of two such wise\r\nheads (or of “benighted ignorance”) coming together, was that neither\r\nof them ever heard of Professor Magne, and that his dictum was “opposed\r\nto all the teachings of physiology.” The learned professor knowing as\r\nmuch about a cow as he did of physiology. And it is such stuff as this\r\nwhich forms the arguments of Mr. Hardin. Professor Salmon in his essay on\r\nContested Dairy Questions effectually settles these “learned” men.\r\n\r\nWe have devoted enough space to a writer, who finds it so easy to tear\r\ndown, but is never able to build up, a doubting Thomas, whose only mode\r\nof judging a cow, he says is a crumple horn, a large udder, and to test\r\nthe milk every Monday for one year. What an amount of money the farmers\r\nof America would lose annually if they followed his rules, and what an\r\namount they would save by following Guenon’s rules!\r\n\r\nThe following valuable essay is from the _Country Gentleman_ of August 7,\r\n1879:\r\n\r\n    Contested Dairy Questions.\r\n\r\n    By D. E. SALMON, _D. V. M._\r\n\r\n    Several of our prominent dairy writers have been lately\r\n    discussing the more complicated questions of their department\r\n    in a very energetic and decided, if not in a scrupulously exact\r\n    manner. Now, if these questions are worth the time and space\r\n    necessary for their presentation at length, they are certainly\r\n    of sufficient importance to receive candid and perfectly\r\n    truthful treatment; and, though these writers may not have\r\n    intended to give wrong impressions, their teachings can hardly\r\n    be considered, in several respects, as representing the present\r\n    condition of knowledge on these points.\r\n\r\n    MAGNE’S THEORY OF THE ESCUTCHEON.—In Mr. Eastburn Reeder’s\r\n    essay on the escutcheon—which is a valuable paper, though\r\n    marred in the above respects—there is an attempt at scientific\r\n    argument in order to ridicule the accepted value of the\r\n    milk-mirror; and the assumed facts on which this argument is\r\n    based, are presented in such a positive manner that they will\r\n    probably be accepted, without further investigation, by the\r\n    majority of readers unless contested at once. The writer has\r\n    hesitated to do this in the hope that it would be done by some\r\n    one else; but the truth is of too much consequence to allow the\r\n    matter to pass entirely without notice.\r\n\r\n    The first point to which I will call attention is the attempt\r\n    to dispute Magne’s opinion that the hair turns in the direction\r\n    in which the arteries ramify, and that the reversed hair on\r\n    the udder and adjacent parts indicates the termination of the\r\n    arteries which supply the udder with blood. When these arteries\r\n    are large, he holds, they extend through the udder upward and\r\n    onward, ramifying on the skin beyond the udder, and giving the\r\n    hair the peculiar appearance which distinguishes it from the\r\n    rest of the surface. If these arteries are very small, they are\r\n    not likely to extend much beyond the udder, and, hence, form a\r\n    small escutcheon; consequently, a small escutcheon indicates a\r\n    feeble supply of blood, and little material to make milk of.\r\n\r\n    Now how is this combatted? The first argument is that “when Mr.\r\n    Hardin showed this paragraph to one of the most learned medical\r\n    professors at Louisville, Kentucky, he at once wanted to know\r\n    who this Magne was, and declared his name unknown in the annals\r\n    of medical science.” What are we to think of such a statement\r\n    as that? Magne—member of the French Academy of Medicine,\r\n    formerly director of the Alfort Veterinary School and professor\r\n    of Lyons—unknown in the annals of medicine!\r\n\r\n    We are then asked if the arteries are not the same in all\r\n    cows, and are told that we might as well expect more bones or\r\n    muscles as more arteries. If Mr. Reeder will turn to Chauveau’s\r\n    Anatomy—one of the best authorities in the world—he will find,\r\n    in general remarks on arteries, the following statement, which\r\n    I translate, not having the English edition: “Arteries very\r\n    often present variations in their deposition, which the surgeon\r\n    should keep in mind. These variations ordinarily concern the\r\n    number, the point of origin, and the volume of the vessels.”\r\n    And if he will go through the list of arteries, he will find\r\n    examples given of each of these variations.\r\n\r\n    Again, he asks, “how is it that the ramification of the\r\n    arterial circulation _causes_ the hair to grow in one direction\r\n    on one part of the cow’s body, and in the opposite on other\r\n    parts?” Not a very difficult question, if we admit that\r\n    arteries have such an effect, for they certainly do not all\r\n    ramify in the same direction.\r\n\r\n    In a revised edition of the essay, subsequently published,\r\n    some important points were added. Here we are told that\r\n    “the arteries supplying the udder with blood are called the\r\n    _mammary_ arteries, and their ramification _does not extend\r\n    beyond the outer surface of the udder_. Further down the\r\n    _aorta_, or main artery, another pair of arteries branches off,\r\n    called the _femoral_ arteries. These supply the muscles of the\r\n    thigh, or what we know as the _rounds of beef_, with blood,\r\n    and ramify upon the portion of the escutcheon lying between\r\n    them. Still further down, another pair of arteries, called the\r\n    _gluteal_ arteries, leave the _aorta_, and are distributed\r\n    through the pelvic region, and ramify upon the extreme upper\r\n    portion of the escutcheon. Here we have at least three distinct\r\n    systems of arteries ramifying upon the escutcheon, and _two_ of\r\n    them most certainly have no connection with the milk secretion\r\n    whatever.”\r\n\r\n    Without attempting to point out _all_ the errors of this\r\n    description, we will once more refer to Chauveau to settle the\r\n    more important points. The reader will find in that work that\r\n    the _femoral_ arteries have a branch called the _pre-pubic_,\r\n    which in turn has a branch called the _external pudic_, from\r\n    which the _mammary_ artery branches. It will also be found\r\n    that the mammary artery “sends several divisions to the\r\n    tissue of the udder, and is prolonged between the thighs by a\r\n    perineal branch, which terminates in the inferior commissure\r\n    of the vulva, after having furnished glandular and _cutaneous_\r\n    divisions.” Turning to the description of the gluteal arteries,\r\n    we find that they ramify in the gluteal muscles, which are at\r\n    a considerable distance from the perineum, and that nothing is\r\n    said of their going to the last named part.\r\n\r\n    Here, then, is complete and positive refutation of these\r\n    arguments—not by mere statements of my own, but by the words of\r\n    a standard work, of world-wide reputation, on the anatomy of\r\n    these animals. Magne’s _facts_ are correct, then, whether his\r\n    inferences are or not. _The same artery that supplies the udder\r\n    with blood supplies the skin on which the escutcheon is formed;\r\n    and, more than this, the artery ramifies in the direction\r\n    in which the hair of the escutcheon grows._ Is there any\r\n    connection between the two for all that? Who knows? A point or\r\n    two to show that such a connection is not beyond the possible\r\n    may still be in place.\r\n\r\n    Erasmus Wilson, who has made a specialty of the skin and its\r\n    diseases, shows that the direction of the hairs on the anterior\r\n    surface of the human body is, commencing at a point near the\r\n    arm-pit, downwards and slightly inwards towards the umbilicus,\r\n    and that below this point the direction is upwards and inwards;\r\n    so that the umbilicus “is the center of convergence of four\r\n    streams,” as he expresses it.\r\n\r\n    Now this disposition, complicated though it is, certainly\r\n    resembles that of the arteries—the branches from the _axillary_\r\n    artery passing downwards and inwards, while the _epigastric_\r\n    arteries branch from the _femorals_ near the groin, and have\r\n    a direction upwards and inwards. On the neck, the direction\r\n    of the hair is upwards and backwards; in front of the ear, it\r\n    is downwards and forwards; behind the ear, it is backwards—in\r\n    each case following the arterial ramifications. In addition,\r\n    Tisserant and others in France, who stand high as authorities,\r\n    admit that the escutcheon continues to increase in relative\r\n    surface till the second or third milking—that is, till the\r\n    development of the udder, and, consequently, of the vessels\r\n    supplying it have reached their highest point.\r\n\r\n    In some cases, it must be confessed, the correspondence in\r\n    question apparently does not exist, but rather the opposite;\r\n    and as the mammary artery has substantially the same\r\n    distribution with horses as with cattle, we cannot see why the\r\n    former should not be as plainly marked as the latter, if the\r\n    direction of the hair depends on the direction of the arteries.\r\n\r\n    But, it may be asked, in what possible manner could the one\r\n    condition influence the other? It must be remembered that\r\n    physiology is still a growing science, and that there are\r\n    many things yet to learn, so that it is still pardonable to\r\n    confess ignorance. We know, however, that the cavity in the\r\n    skin surrounding the hair (hair follicle) is set in an oblique\r\n    direction, as well as the hair that emerges from it; the\r\n    papilla at the bottom of this cavity must also be inclined,\r\n    and it is this that, in all probability, decides the direction\r\n    of the hair, as the growth of this takes place by additions\r\n    of cells from the surface of the papilla. Now, each papilla,\r\n    or elevation, has a vascular loop, or, as some say, a minute\r\n    artery and vein, and one can easily imagine how the direction\r\n    of this minute artery might influence the direction of the\r\n    papillary summit, and, consequently, of the hair that grows\r\n    from it.\r\n\r\n    I do not say that this is the proper explanation, but I suggest\r\n    it as one way in which the correspondence might be accounted\r\n    for. I do say, however, that the evidence brought to bear on\r\n    this point by Mr. Reeder can have no influence in deciding the\r\n    question, for the reason I have given.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Henry Stewart, the noted scientific and practical farmer\r\n    and writer, said lately; “I have for some time past been\r\n    studying the nature of the escutcheon physiogically and\r\n    anatomically.” And he has “recently discovered a still more\r\n    satisfactory connection between the milking capacity of a cow\r\n    and the development of the escutcheon.”\r\n\r\n    “The milk-vein is an important mark of the deep-milking cow.\r\n    But it is not the veins, but the arteries, which supply blood\r\n    to the system, either for the production of tissue or the\r\n    secretion of the milk. And yet the veins are important because\r\n    they bear a direct relation to the arteries, being the return\r\n    channels for the blood after it has fulfilled its functions;\r\n    and so the larger supply of blood conveyed by the arteries\r\n    requiring a vein of large capacity to return it, this vein is\r\n    an ultimate indication of the vigor of the circulation of the\r\n    lacteal organs. The main artery which supplies these organs\r\n    is the subcutaneous abdominal [what Mr. S. says is commonly\r\n    called the milk-vein.] This important artery supplies a large\r\n    part of the posterior portion of the system, furnishing blood\r\n    to the genital organs and the skin covering these and the\r\n    adjacent parts. The subcutaneous abdominal artery is one of the\r\n    two branches of the external pudic artery in the female, the\r\n    other being the mammary artery. This last is very voluminous\r\n    and distributes several main branches to the mammary glands\r\n    and tissue, and also by a prolongation between the thighs,\r\n    supplies the inferior commissure of the vulva and gives off\r\n    many smaller branches, which spread into a network among the\r\n    glandular tissue and the cutaneous structure. Here is the close\r\n    connection, then, between the skin of the posterior part of the\r\n    cow, from the lower point of the vulva down between the thighs\r\n    and around the udder, and the udder itself. The same artery\r\n    supplies all this portion of the skin, furnishes the subaceous\r\n    glands and the hair follicles, and the whole cutaneous\r\n    structure, and the hair also with blood, and also provides\r\n    for the demands of the milk-secreting organs. A vigorous\r\n    circulation through a voluminous arterial system ... gives a\r\n    relatively vigorous milk secretion, and, as well, a growth of\r\n    hair, which curls and forms the well-known peculiar structure\r\n    of the escutcheon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. L. SHARPLESS ON THE ESCUTCHEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe extract from our book on “The Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney Cow,”\r\nsome remarks on the escutcheon, by Charles L. Sharpless, of Philadelphia.\r\nWe consider him one of the best judges, a most intelligent breeder,\r\nand he has paid the highest price ever given for a Jersey cow in this\r\ncountry. The portraits of Duchess, Rosa, Black Bess, Tiberia, and the\r\nbull, Comet of M., bear out our assertion.\r\n\r\n    “There is no point in judging a cow so little understood as\r\n    the escutcheon. The conclusion of almost every one is, that\r\n    her escutcheon is good, if there be a broad band of up-running\r\n    hair from the udder to the vulva, and around it—see Fig. 1.\r\n    These cows, with the broad vertical escutcheon, are nearly\r\n    always parallel cows; that is, with bodies long, but not large,\r\n    and with the under line parallel with the back. Their thighs\r\n    are thin, and the thigh escutcheon shows on the inside of the\r\n    thigh, rather than on its rear.\r\n\r\n    “Next comes the wedge-shaped cow, with the body shorter, but\r\n    very large, deep in the flank, and very capacious. This form\r\n    does not usually exhibit the broad vertical escutcheon, running\r\n    up to the vulva, but with a broader thigh may exhibit a thigh\r\n    escutcheon, which is preferable to the other, thus—see Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n    “In both vertical and thigh mirrors, where the hair runs down,\r\n    intruding on the udder, (as low as above the dotted lines,) as\r\n    in Figs. 3 and 4, it damages the escutcheon. If you find a cow\r\n    with the hair all running down, and between the thighs—that is,\r\n    with no up-running hair—stamp her as a cipher for milk-yielding.\r\n\r\n    “The artist has made the udders to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 the\r\n    same size, while in reality they will vary according to the\r\n    escutcheon.\r\n\r\n    “There are times when the udder of a cow, with an escutcheon\r\n    like Fig. 4, will be enlarged by non-milking, for the purpose\r\n    of deception. It is always safer to judge by the escutcheon,\r\n    rather than by the large size of the udder.\r\n\r\n    “The escutcheons of the best cows—those yielding the most and\r\n    continuing the longest—will be found to be those which conform\r\n    to Fig. 2. [Mr. S. alludes to the selvage: one of the best, and\r\n    common among the best cows. H.]\r\n\r\n    “The vertical escutcheon of Fig. 1, would not injure it; but if\r\n    that ornamental feature has to be at the expense of the thigh\r\n    escutcheon, Fig. 2 is best as it is.\r\n\r\n    “Whenever an escutcheon is accompanied by a curl on each\r\n    hind-quarter of the udder, it indicates a yield of the highest\r\n    order....\r\n\r\n    “So far we have noticed only the rear escutcheon, or that\r\n    which represents the two hind-quarters of the udder. The two\r\n    front-quarters are just as important, and should be capacious,\r\n    and run well forward under the body—see A. If the udder,\r\n    in front, be concave, or cut up as in B, indicating small\r\n    capacity, it represents reduced yield.\r\n\r\n    “This front or level escutcheon is distinctly marked in the\r\n    young heifer or bull, and can be seen by laying the animal on\r\n    its back. The udder hair under the body all runs backward,\r\n    commencing at the forward line of the escutcheon—see dotted\r\n    lines in Figs. 6, 7, 8. This dividing line is very perceptible,\r\n    from the fact that the hair in front of it all runs forward\r\n    towards the head of the animal, while the escutcheon, or udder\r\n    hair, all runs backward over the forward quarters of the udder,\r\n    around and beyond the teats, and ceases at the markings of the\r\n    rear escutcheon, on and between the thighs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6. LOTTIE STARR.—10 mos. old.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7. SYLVA—10 mos. old.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8. COLUMBUS.—10 mos. old.]\r\n\r\n    “The breadth and extent forward of this front escutcheon,\r\n    indicates the capacity in the mature animal, of the front\r\n    quarters of her udder. In some cases this front escutcheon\r\n    will be found of twice the extent that it is in others, and is\r\n    evidence of that much more yield. The dimensions on Figs. 6, 7,\r\n    8, are actual measurements—the first two of heifers, and the\r\n    last of a bull. If Fig. 7 represents four quarts as the yield\r\n    per day of the front quarters, Fig. 6 will represent eight,\r\n    thus, if the rear yield is the same, say four quarts in each\r\n    cow, the total yield of Fig. 6 will be twelve quarts, while\r\n    that of Fig. 7 is but eight. This examination enables one to\r\n    see the size of the teats and their distance apart, and to test\r\n    the looseness and softness of the udder skin. It is marked\r\n    precisely the same in bulls, see Fig. 8, and can be easily\r\n    examined at any age between one and ten months.\r\n\r\n    “Udders of all shapes hold milk, and some homely ones hold\r\n    a large quantity. B, C, D, and E, at a glance explain their\r\n    deficiencies, both of shape, lack of capacity, and bad style of\r\n    teats. In udder A, we have the perfect shape....\r\n\r\n    “Many think that the escutcheon of the bull is of but little\r\n    moment, so that he is a good-looker. So far is this from being\r\n    the case, that a bull, with a mirror like Fig. 4. or worse,\r\n    will stamp his escutcheon on, and to that extent damage his\r\n    daughters, out of cows with escutcheons as choice as Fig. 2.\r\n    In this way the daughters of some of the best cows come very\r\n    ordinary, while, if you use a bull marked like Fig. 2, he will\r\n    make poor escutcheons better, and will improve the best. His\r\n    injury or benefit will be doubled, according to the escutcheon\r\n    markings under his body in front of his scrotum. Hence the\r\n    importance of the dam of a bull being unexceptionable in her\r\n    udder and escutcheon. Her qualities, inherited by her son, will\r\n    be transmitted to his daughters.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Sharpless’ bull Comet of M. is one of the finest Jersey bulls\r\nwe ever saw, and his escutcheon is unexceptionable, being a perfect\r\ncurveline, the one most commonly found on bulls.]\r\n\r\n    “While careful as to escutcheons, we must not neglect the\r\n    other essential features of a good cow—the buckskin hide, the\r\n    rich-colored skin, and the fine bone. Let the hair be soft and\r\n    thickly set, and let the skin be mellow. This latter quality is\r\n    easily determined by grasping between the thumb and forefinger\r\n    the skin at the rear of the ribs, or the double thickness at\r\n    the base of the flank that joins the stifle joint to the body,\r\n    or that on the inside of the rump-bone at the setting-on of\r\n    the tail. Let the teats be well apart; let them yield a full\r\n    and free stream, and be large enough to fill the hand without\r\n    the necessity in milking of pulling them between the thumb\r\n    and forefingers. And let us ever keep in mind that the large\r\n    yielder must be well fed.”\r\n\r\nThose who condemn Jersey cows as small yielders of milk and butter,\r\nshould listen to the story of “Rosa” as told by her owner, C. L.\r\nSharpless. She is five years old, is solid creamy fawn, and, combined\r\nwith great volume and bone, she is neat in the head and neck, and with\r\nfine legs. Her dam was a small mouse-colored cow, and her sire’s dam a\r\nsmall fawn-colored, neither of which would give over twelve quarts.\r\n\r\n    “We found we were making a good deal of butter, and as ‘Rosa’\r\n    looked superbly, we determined to test her butter quality. We\r\n    fed her per day twenty pounds of hay, eight quarts of meal, and\r\n    four quarts of carrots. The meal was a mixture of good wheat\r\n    bran and cornmeal, in the proportion of four bushels of the\r\n    former to one bushel of the latter. Her yield the first day was\r\n    sixteen quarts, the second day fifteen and a half quarts, the\r\n    third day sixteen quarts, and the next morning eight quarts;\r\n    being in all seven milkings, or half the week. Her milk was\r\n    kept separate; was skimmed after standing thirty-six hours, and\r\n    made six and three fourths pounds of butter, or thirteen and a\r\n    half pounds for the week.\r\n\r\n    “As you place Rosa and Duchess side by side there are some\r\n    points of agreement and of difference that are of interest to\r\n    notice. They are both wedge-shaped, with large body—Duchess\r\n    the more bony, but Rosa with the greater rear volume, (broader\r\n    hips, &c.) They both have neat heads and necks, and fine bone.\r\n    Duchess is, in winter, smoke-color, with brilliant white, but\r\n    not with black points. She has yellow hoofs and skin, and\r\n    her udder is rich yellow. Rosa has yellow hoofs, and yellow\r\n    inside her ears, but a pale skin and udder, and would be\r\n    called a butter cow inferior to Duchess, and yet she has just\r\n    proved herself one half pound greater. The color of it is the\r\n    deepest—no coloring matter being used. This upsets the theory\r\n    that a yellow skin is essential for deep-colored butter.\r\n    Perhaps a safer way to put it is, that though a rich yellow\r\n    skin is evidence of butter quality, yet equally good quality\r\n    may come from a pale skin, provided the cow has yellow inside\r\n    her ears.\r\n\r\n    “Again, as to vertical or rear escutcheons both these cows\r\n    exhibit, the broad part diminishes as it rises, until, when\r\n    within six to nine inches of the vulva, it is reduced to the\r\n    breadth of not over an inch wide. Thus they agree in their rear\r\n    escutcheons, and they agree also in udders of great capacity,\r\n    these being deep and broad, and running well forward under the\r\n    body.\r\n\r\n    “There is a point on which they differ. The hair on Duchess\r\n    is soft and furry as a mole; that of Rosa is fairly fine, but\r\n    still hair.\r\n\r\n    “So that in a word one can say soft hair, a large escutcheon,\r\n    and a yellow skin are desirable, but there may be choice cows\r\n    not conspicuous, for either.\r\n\r\n    “To show how we sometimes let our best animals slip, I will add\r\n    that when Rosa was a heifer I was tempted to part with her for\r\n    what seemed a great price—$500. In about two weeks she had a\r\n    heifer calf, for which her owner was offered $150. When three\r\n    years old she had a second heifer, which he sold for $180;\r\n    and when four years old she had a third heifer calf, which\r\n    he sold for $100. He then sold his place and all his stock,\r\n    and I bought her at public sale for $375 for her beauty. Her\r\n    pale skin deceived me as to her butter quality, and her, as I\r\n    thought, deficient escutcheon misled me as to her large yield.\r\n    She now, as a five-year old, has her fourth calf, which is a\r\n    bull, and some two months old.\r\n\r\n    “In giving above her yield, I gave also her feed. Such is her\r\n    constitution and appetite that I think she would have eaten\r\n    half as much more, and in that way her yield might have been\r\n    very much increased. It was good enough as it was, particularly\r\n    as there have been choice cows so forced that, though the\r\n    premium was won, the cow was lost. The winter yield, on dry\r\n    feed, of sixteen quarts is considered equivalent to eighteen on\r\n    grass.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSA.—Imported Jersey, belonging to C. L. Sharpless.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CLASSES AND ORDERS.\r\n\r\nPrepared by W. P. HAZARD, _Secretary of the Pennsylvania Guenon\r\nCommission_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following descriptions of the ten classes, and their sub-division\r\ninto six orders each, we give the quantity as stated, for a large-sized\r\ncow. Not thinking it worth while to enter so minutely into his\r\nsub-divisions of high, medium, and low cows. For instance, to class one,\r\norder one, he gives to the high cow twenty-four litres, which is about\r\nequal to our twenty-four quarts here; the litre being exactly two and one\r\neighth wine pints. To the medium cow he gives nineteen quarts, and to\r\nthe low cow, fourteen quarts, per day. The size of his high cow is five\r\nhundred and fifty to six hundred and fifty pounds, _dressed weight_; the\r\nmedium, three hundred and twenty-five to four hundred and fifty pounds\r\nand the low, one hundred and ten to two hundred and twenty-five pounds.\r\nAs most of our cows will range with the high cows, we have adopted the\r\nscale suitable to the size, only the reader who practices the system must\r\nkeep in mind that the larger and more developed the cow, the more she\r\nwill be likely to give than the cow of smaller size.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Class. The Flanders Cow.\r\n\r\nCows with this escutcheon are the most seldom found, except among the\r\nmost abundant milkers. In the first order they give twenty quarts per\r\nday, in the height of their flow; that is to say, from the time they\r\nhave calved until they are pregnant again. Then they diminish, little by\r\nlittle, until their next calving. It is best to dry them off from four to\r\nsix weeks before calving, to give them a needed rest, and it improves the\r\ncalf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCows of the first class have a soft udder, with fine hair on it, rising\r\nuntil it blends with similar hair growing upward on the thighs, above\r\nthe hock, and widening on the thick part of the thigh, then narrowing,\r\nlike in the engraving, until it reaches the vulva, and being about two\r\ninches on each side of it. The inner parts of the thigh, and the vertical\r\nmirror are usually of a yellowish or nankeen color, with dark spots on\r\nthem, from which can be detached the dandruff. There are two ovals on the\r\nudder, of fine short hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order of the first class are similar to the first, but the\r\nescutcheon is smaller; and on the right side of the vulva is a tuft\r\nof descending hair about two and one half inches long and one and one\r\nhalf inches broad, and there is but one oval on the udder. They yield\r\neighteen quarts of milk for a period of eight months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order of the first class is still smaller, and not quite so\r\ndecided in shape. It has also a semi-circular tuft below the vulva of\r\nsmall size, of descending hair, rather shining and of brighter color.\r\nThere is either only one oval on the udder, or generally none.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order yield sixteen quarts, and milk for six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order of the first class, besides being still smaller, has\r\nnarrower thigh escutcheons, and lower down; also the tuft under the\r\nvulva is quite long, about five or six inches, which sometimes make the\r\nvertical escutcheon terminate in a fork. This tuft has more lustre and is\r\nwhiter than the hair around it. There is also a thigh tuft of half oval\r\nshape on the right of the escutcheon, about five inches high.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order yield twelve quarts a day, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bastard Flanders have two marks which distinguish them: 1. Some have\r\non the vertical escutcheon an oval tuft, about the middle of it; this\r\ntuft has descending hair, is about three inches long and two inches wide,\r\nand the lustre of the hair makes it appear as if it was whiter than that\r\naround it. The larger the oval the sooner the milk will fail, and the\r\nsmaller it is the longer will she milk. 2. Other Bastards of this class\r\nare distinguished by the ascending and descending hair interfering with\r\neach other on the outlines of the vertical escutcheon, looking feathery,\r\nor bristling like the beard of wheat. The skin is fine and reddish, but\r\nthere is no dandruff. The larger the escutcheon, and the finer the hair,\r\nthe more abundant the milk; but when the hair is coarse, long, and thin,\r\nthe yield is small. Both kinds of Bastards of this class have every other\r\nappearance of the best cows. And all Bastards of the first classes have\r\nthe two ovals on the udder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Class. Left Flanders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cows of this class are very similar to those of the first class,\r\nthough their yield is rather less. The vertical escutcheon is entirely to\r\nthe left of the vulva, and the thigh escutcheon on the right is broader\r\nthan that on the left. By comparison with the first class, these will be\r\nseen to be very similar, but in each order smaller; therefore, it will\r\nnot be necessary to describe them separately, but simply to state the\r\nyield. Cows of the first order of the second class will yield eighteen\r\nquarts, and milk eight months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order of the second class have the lip-shaped tuft to the left\r\nof the vulva, and have one oval on the left of the udder. Cows of this\r\norder give sixteen quarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order has the same shaped escutcheon, but more contracted,\r\nand the lip-shaped tuft is larger and whiter. Cows of this order give\r\nfourteen quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order has two invasions of the thigh escutcheon by the\r\ndown-growing hair, a semi-oval one on the right, and a triangular one on\r\nthe left. These always indicate a reduced quantity of milk.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give ten quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe escutcheon of the Bastard Left Flanders is known by this peculiarity.\r\nThe developments are larger and more irregular on the top of the\r\nvertical escutcheon, and to the left of the vulva; on the right is the\r\nischiatic tuft, quite large, from which the hair is diverted in an almost\r\nhorizontal direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Class.—Selvage.\r\n\r\nThe escutcheon of this class commences above the hock, runs up on the\r\nthighs quite high, thence it descends somewhat from both sides to the\r\nvertical portion, which rises, gradually narrowing to the vulva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first order of the third class has an udder with soft skin, and fine\r\ndowny hair, which, as well as the thighs, are of a yellow or nankeen cast\r\nof color. There are two ovals on the udder. Cows of the first order give\r\nnineteen quarts, and milk eight months, and often will milk nine months,\r\nnot going dry unless made to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order is similar to the first, only of reduced size; it has\r\na tuft to the left of the vulva; and only one oval on the udder on the\r\nleft side; the hair of the escutcheon is generally more glossy than that\r\naround it. Cows of the second order give seventeen quarts, and milk seven\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order escutcheon curves downward on each side of the vertical\r\nmirror, which rises narrowing to a point at the vulva; to the right and\r\nleft of the vulva are tufts, the one on the left being the longest; on\r\nthe left of the udder is sometimes an oval. Cows of the third order give\r\nfifteen quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe escutcheon of the fourth order is of similar shape, but still\r\nsmaller; but the tuft on left of the vulva is much longer than on the\r\nright, and there is no oval on the udder.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give twelve quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe bastards of the third class have two tufts, one on the right, and one\r\non the left of the vulva, about four to five inches long, and one and one\r\nhalf inches wide. The smaller they are, and the finer the hair on them,\r\nthe less rapid is the loss of milk. But if they are large and have coarse\r\nhair, and are pointed at each end, they prove the milk to be poor and\r\nserous, and the cow will fail rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Class. Curveline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Curveline cows are very plenty, and are of a very good grade,\r\napproaching the first class. The escutcheon is broader than the last\r\ntwo classes, in the upper part. Their skin is of delicate texture, and\r\nnankeen shade of color on the escutcheon. The higher and broader the\r\ncurved line rises toward the vulva, which it never reaches, the better\r\nit is. There are two ovals on the udder. Cows of the first order of the\r\nfourth class give 19 quarts, and milk eight months, and sometimes up to\r\ntheir next calf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order have the same shape escutcheon, but more contracted.\r\nThere is but one, and sometimes no oval on the udder. On the left of the\r\nvulva is a small tuft.\r\n\r\nCows of the second order give seventeen quarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order has a smaller escutcheon, with two tufts by the vulva,\r\nthe left longer than the right, about four inches by one inch wide.\r\nSometimes an oval on the left side of the udder.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order give fifteen quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order has a much smaller escutcheon, reaching just above\r\nthe udder. The two tufts are larger alongside the vulva, and the hairs\r\nbristle to each side. On the right, the down-growing hair intrudes\r\nsomewhat upon the escutcheon.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give twelve quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bastards of the fourth class have a fine appearance of escutcheon,\r\nbut they are known by the tufts alongside the vulva. If they have coarse\r\nbristly hair, and of large size, say four to five inches long, and one\r\nand a half in width, they indicate a rapid loss of milk as soon as\r\npregnant, particularly if they are pointed at each end.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Class. The Bicorn.\r\n\r\nThe escutcheons of this class in the vertical portion end below the vulva\r\nin an indented shape, presenting the appearance of two upright horns.\r\nTheir udders are of a saffron color, delicate, with fine, soft hair, and\r\nhave much dandruff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first order has two tufts of small size along the vulva, and two\r\novals on the udder. They give seventeen quarts, and milk eight months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order are similar to the first, only smaller escutcheons, the\r\nvulva tufts are longer, and there is but one oval on the udder, on the\r\nleft. The right horn of the escutcheon is smaller than the left one.\r\n\r\nCows of the second order give fifteen quarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order have similar escutcheons to the last, but smaller, while\r\nthe vulva tufts are larger, there are no ovals, and there is an invasion\r\nof the descending hair on the right side. The right is two inches shorter\r\nthan the left.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order give thirteen quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order have the same shaped escutcheon, but smaller, with two\r\ntufts alongside the vulva, larger than those on the last. On the right of\r\nthe escutcheon is a triangular cut in the shape, made by encroachments of\r\nthe down-growing hair.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give ten quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bastards of the fifth class have the full escutcheon of the first\r\nor second orders, but with two large tufts alongside the vulva, which,\r\naccording to their size, and more or less pointed shape, and fine or\r\ncoarse hair, indicate the more or less stoppage of the flow of milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Class. Double Selvage.\r\n\r\nThe escutcheons of Double Selvage cows differ from those of Selvage, or\r\nthe third class, in that the escutcheon is marked in its whole length by\r\na strip of hair descending and dividing it into two equal portions. It\r\nis bordered in its whole length and at the extremity by a double line of\r\nascending hair, which extends the escutcheon up to the vulva. Otherwise\r\nit is like the selvage escutcheon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first order cows have a fine udder, soft, and covered with a silky\r\ndown; and its skin is yellowish or nankeen. Cows of the first order give\r\neighteen quarts, and milk full eight months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order have a similar escutcheon, but smaller, and the\r\nseparating strip ends higher up. Cows of the second order give sixteen\r\nquarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order have a still more reduced escutcheon, the descending\r\nstrip terminating at the udder.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order give fourteen quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order have an escutcheon more broken in appearance, the two\r\nside lines of the selvage terminate half way to the vulva, and end off in\r\nlines of a feathery appearance, the hair is coarser and more furry.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give ten quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBastards of the sixth class have the escutcheon similar to the first\r\nclass, but the selvage lines terminate on each side of the vulva in tufts\r\nof coarse and bristly hair; the larger and coarser they are, the sooner\r\nthe milk will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Class. Demijohn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first order of this class has the skin of the escutcheon of yellowish\r\ncolor. The udder is fine, and covered with a silky down to the inside of\r\nthe thighs; and the dandruff is soft and oily to the touch. The shape\r\nis similar to the selvage somewhat, only the vertical mirror rises\r\nbroader and straighter, and ends half way up to the vulva, cut square\r\noff. The broader and higher this part is, the better the escutcheon. The\r\nescutcheon is not so high up on the thighs as the previous classes. There\r\nare two ovals on the udder, and two small tufts of fine hair alongside\r\nthe vulva.\r\n\r\nCows of the first order give seventeen quarts, and milk eight months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order have the escutcheon lower down and, of course, smaller\r\nin every way. There are two tufts alongside the vulva, the left one as\r\nlarge as in the first order, (two and a half inches,) the right one only\r\nhalf as long. There is one oval on the left of the udder.\r\n\r\nCows of the second order give fifteen quarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order escutcheon is of different shape, the lines converging\r\ndownwards from the vertical mirror, which is short, and cut off square.\r\nThe right side frequently has a curved line from the descending hair\r\ninvading it. The vulva tufts are longer than in the second order.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order give thirteen quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order has the escutcheon still smaller. The tufts alongside\r\nthe vulva are not so plain, but the hair is coarse and bristly. There is\r\na triangular invasion on the right of the escutcheon.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give ten quarts and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bastards of this class have a good escutcheon, but the tufts are\r\nlarge and of coarse, bristly hair, and will fail according to the size.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Class. Square Escutcheon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first order of this class have the same yellowish color on the\r\nescutcheon as other first orders; the udder is flexible, covered with a\r\nshort, fine down. The escutcheon is much of the shape of the Demijohns,\r\nbut the vertical, as it rises, branches square off to the left, and\r\nascends, straight and narrow, to the left side of the vulva. There are\r\ntwo ovals on the udder. The more the square approaches the vulva, and the\r\nfiner the hair, the greater quantity is there of milk. Cows of the first\r\norder give seventeen quarts, and milk eight months.\r\n\r\nThe second order have a similar escutcheon, only smaller in every way.\r\nThey have two ovals on the udder, and a small tuft to the right of the\r\nvulva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCows of the second order give fifteen quarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order have the escutcheon still smaller; the lines curving\r\ndownward at the corners; one oval on the udder, and the tuft to the right\r\nof the vulva, larger and of coarser hair.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order give thirteen quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order have the escutcheon much smaller, the square is much\r\nlower, and the upper part of it is formed of bristly hair, and feathery\r\nlooking; as is also the tuft to the right. On the right side of the\r\nescutcheon is an invasion of triangular shape.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give ten quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bastards of the eighth class are distinguished from those of the\r\nfirst order by the tuft on the right, which is of coarse and bristly\r\nhair, and the square terminates also in the same hair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Class. Limousines.\r\n\r\nThe escutcheons of this class, in ascending toward the vulva, do so in\r\nthe shape of a spire, but stop short about half way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first order has the escutcheon of yellowish color, with flexible\r\nudder, covered with hair downy and silky. The shape is the same as the\r\nseventh and eighth class, except that the vertical escutcheon ends in a\r\nsharp point, like a spire or arrow head. There are tufts along each side\r\nof the vulva, and two ovals on the udder.\r\n\r\nCows of the first order give fifteen quarts, and milk eight months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order is similar in the escutcheon, but smaller, with but one\r\noval on the udder, and the vulva tufts larger, the left being longer than\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nCows of the second order give thirteen quarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order is again smaller; the corners rounded downward; the tufts\r\nlarger; no oval on the udder.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order give ten quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order same shape as the last, but still smaller and more\r\nrounding. The vulva tufts are of bristly hair, and the left one is seven\r\ninches long.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give eight quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Bastards of the ninth class have a good escutcheon, but are\r\ndistinguished by the large tufts of coarse, bristly hair alongside the\r\nvulva.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tenth Class.—Horizontal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first order have a dandruff of yellowish color; the hair is short,\r\nfine, and silky; the escutcheon is lower down from the vulva than the\r\nother classes, and is cut off by a horizontal line. There are two ovals\r\non the udder; and two tufts, about three and one half inches long, on the\r\nsides of the vulva.\r\n\r\nCows of the first order give thirteen quarts, and milk eight months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second order has a smaller escutcheon; the vulva tufts are larger,\r\nthe right shorter than the left; there is but one udder oval; in several\r\nof the orders of this class there is a small streak of ascending hair\r\ndirectly below the vulva.\r\n\r\nCows of the second order give ten quarts, and milk seven months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe third order have still smaller escutcheons; larger vulva tufts, the\r\none on the left of bristling hair, four to five inches in length. The\r\ndescending hair encroaches on the escutcheon on the right in a triangular\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nCows of the third order give eight quarts, and milk six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe fourth order have still smaller escutcheons; larger and coarser vulva\r\ntufts; and an invasion on the escutcheon on the right in triangular\r\nshape, and on the left of semi-circular shape.\r\n\r\nCows of the fourth order give seven quarts, and milk five months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe bastards of the tenth class have the escutcheons large and good\r\nshaped; but are distinguished by the tufts alongside the vulva, these\r\ntell how long she will milk, by their size and the grade of the hair on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects of Crossing two Escutcheons.\r\n\r\nCROSS BETWEEN THE SELVAGE AND LEFT FLANDERS.—The cows bearing this\r\ncharacter are easily recognizable in certain breeds, and notably on those\r\nof the north-east of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCROSS BETWEEN THE BICORN AND SELVAGE.—The _Epi_, or tuft, which I termed\r\n_jonctif_, or mesian tuft, and which is seen adhering under the vulva,\r\nis a favorable sign, and can be met with in those classes where the\r\nescutcheon does not reach as high as the vulva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCows which bear one or the other of these two escutcheons, are generally\r\ngood milkers, and preserve their milk as well as cows of the first order\r\nof each class. These are the new escutcheons alluded to in Guenon’s\r\nintroduction, showing the effect of crossing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESCUTCHEONS ON BULLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuenon applied his discovery to bulls to great advantage. He found that\r\nbulls belonged to the same classes as cows, and had escutcheons similar,\r\nbut much smaller; these extend from the testicles upward toward the anus.\r\nThe importance of having a good bull becomes apparent when we reflect\r\nthat he “gets” from fifty to one hundred, annually, while the cow is\r\nimpregnated but once in the year. The escutcheons of the progeny of a cow\r\nwith good escutcheon will be much improved if the cow is coupled with a\r\nbull well marked, and particularly if his escutcheon is the same as that\r\nof the cow. Better have the two of different breeds, but of similar or\r\ngood escutcheons, than to have the bull with inferior escutcheon.\r\n\r\nOf course, the higher up the escutcheon extends on a bull, and the\r\nbroader it is, the better it is, but we must not look for bulls to be\r\nso well-marked as cows are, for they never are. To distinguish the\r\nbastard bulls from the good ones, observe if there are any streaks of\r\ndescending hair, and mixing so as to be bristly. This indication will be\r\na certain one in proportion to the size of the blemish, and as that is in\r\nproportion to the whole escutcheon.\r\n\r\nGuenon says: After having described, as I have done, all the classes of\r\ncows, and taught to recognize the bastards, I pass to the characteristic\r\nsigns of the bulls re-producers, which can also be divided into orders\r\nand classes; the signs are the same as for the females, but they are much\r\nmore restricted and of less extent.\r\n\r\nWith the males the escutcheon commences on the inside below the hams and\r\nextends as far as the middle of the posterior surface of the leg, and\r\nextends sometimes even to the anus of the superior orders in certain\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nLike that of cows, the escutcheon of bulls is modified by tufts.\r\n\r\nThe bulls whose escutcheons are similar in their form and size to cows of\r\nthe first order, possess a great ability for procreating good milk cows,\r\nthose on the contrary whose escutcheons are but little developed, produce\r\nonly those of poor yield.\r\n\r\nA bull will be well marked, and a good reproducer when there is no\r\ninterruption of descending hair in the ascending hair on the escutcheon;\r\nwhen the shape of the escutcheon is of large dimensions in proportion to\r\nthe size of the animal, and it is covered with very fine hair.\r\n\r\nThe bulls of which the escutcheon is small and covered with coarse hair\r\nand irregular on the sides procreate bad milk cows, which give serous\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Escutcheon of Guernsey Bull RADLEY.\r\n\r\nNo. 209, A. G. H. B.]\r\n\r\nAll interruptions in the ascending hair of the escutcheon by\r\nencroachments of the descending hair on the right or left, in the lower\r\npart of the thigh, indicate for their get a lower grade, and at a glance\r\nthe inferiority of the milk production.\r\n\r\nThe yellow or nankeen color of the skin of the escutcheon is always a\r\nfavorable sign.\r\n\r\nThe good reproducing bull will prove fecund until ten or fifteen years of\r\nage, but it is a rare exception.\r\n\r\nAny one may be grossly deceived if he judges only by the appearance or\r\nthe shape of the prolific qualities of a bull. Experience or observation\r\nalone can show that he has maintained his early ability.\r\n\r\nA vigorous bull, well fed, can serve one or more cows each day, but it\r\nis of great importance that he shall not commence to serve until he is\r\nfifteen or eighteen months old, otherwise he will be speedily exhausted\r\nand deformed. The improving mark of his cross and his vigor will be\r\nspeedily shortened.\r\n\r\nWhen the bull has attained the age of two and a half or three years,\r\nthe form alters, the hind-quarters become attenuated, the front quarter\r\nbecomes much enlarged, his neck enlarges and thickens, &c.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, whether he is castrated or whether he is “twisted,” he\r\npreserves always the altered form of the bull, and is less sought for\r\nwork, and in less request for butchering.\r\n\r\nWhen the operations of castration and twisting are done too late, the\r\nanimal has less predisposition to fatten; his flesh is harder and\r\ntougher; he is, however, in appearance in the same conditions of age, of\r\nquality, and of nourishment, as those castrated earlier.\r\n\r\nOften bulls, whose character is docile and gentle, become wild and\r\nfurious when they are used to serve.\r\n\r\nIn certain regions, to tame them, they put a ring of iron in their nose;\r\nin others, where the good use of these rings is not known, they are\r\nobliged to castrate or twist them. This operation suffices, generally, to\r\ncontrol their passion; but, if not, they are sent to the butcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification of Bull Reproducers.\r\n\r\nThere are for bulls, as for cows, ten classes or families; each class\r\nsub-divided into several orders, and each order comprises three grades,\r\nhigh, medium, and low.\r\n\r\nI only admit, in each class, three orders. If one wishes to proceed in\r\nthe application with more rigor, he will follow the sub-divisions of the\r\nclassification of the cows. I will designate the three orders of each\r\nclass by the denominations of good, medium, and bad.\r\n\r\nThe signs indicating the qualities which render the bull likely to beget\r\ngood milk cows are placed, like those of the female, on the posterior\r\nparts. They start from the bag, and rise up to the anus, covering, also,\r\nthe genital parts, and the scrotum.\r\n\r\nWith bulls, the escutcheons start from the anterior part of the bag,\r\nextending inside, and upon the hams, projecting on the thighs; from\r\nthere, the curved lines, obtuse or acute, following the class, joining to\r\nthe right or the left under the anus.\r\n\r\nThe escutcheon, in all its extent, is shown by the fineness of the hair,\r\nand the skin; by the color, more or less yellow, of the epidermis, and of\r\nthe particles of dandruff which can be detached.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic secondary signs of the females will also be found in\r\nthe males.\r\n\r\nBulls, like cows, have four and, sometimes, six false teats, which are\r\nfound before the bag, in the direction of the navel. These teats are\r\nsmall and short.\r\n\r\nStarting from the bag, one notices to the right and the left of the\r\nstomach two veins resembling the two milk veins of cows. They are\r\nprolonged to and pass a little in the direction of the navel, and\r\nterminate in a small cavity.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the characteristic signs indicated above, the bull\r\nre-producers should unite all the essential conditions which in each\r\nlocality constitute the type of the pure race. These conditions are:\r\n\r\n1. The color of the hide preferred in that country.\r\n\r\n2. A size proportioned to the race that they are to continue. A shape and\r\na frame usually accepted.\r\n\r\n3. To be of the first order in each class, easily showing the power of\r\ntransmitting milking qualities.\r\n\r\n4. Aptitude for fattening.\r\n\r\n5. To be good for work.\r\n\r\n6. To have a docile and patient character.\r\n\r\nThe evils of conformation, like the good qualities, are transmitted\r\ngenerally by the act of generation. If it does not have the ability to do\r\nthis, one should quickly correct it.\r\n\r\nHere the bovine race has been much neglected in all these respects. A\r\njudicious choice, and a scrupulous attention is not always prevalent in\r\nselecting a breeding animal; thus it results in a fatal re-generation, to\r\nwhich it is time to put a stop.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the distinctive characteristics of the ten classes of\r\nbulls, it will be useful to mention those classes which are oftener met\r\nin French and foreign races; and also those which are more rare.\r\n\r\nThe classes which are most distributed, and which present the greatest\r\nnumber of bulls, are in all races these three classes: 1. The\r\nCurved-line; 2. The Limousine; 3. The Horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe classes on the contrary, which present but a very small number of\r\nsubjects are in the following order:\r\n\r\n    4. Demijohn.\r\n    5. Bicorne.\r\n    6. Square-cut.\r\n    7. Selvage.\r\n    8. Left Flanders.\r\n    9. Double Selvage.\r\n    10. Flanders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUERNSEY BULL RADLEY, No. 209.\r\n\r\nPROPERTY OF S. C. KENT, WEST GROVE, PA.]\r\n\r\nThe reason one finds so few good breeding bulls belonging to the first\r\nclass, is first, the small number of such animals compared to that\r\nof cows; and next, the lack of knowledge of the best ones to keep.\r\nOftentimes for want of this knowledge, the best bulls were castrated for\r\noxen or for fattening, thus by chance, the poorest are often kept.\r\n\r\nThe best individuals have generally at birth, all the qualities which\r\ncharacterize a superior animal. They are easily kept and fattened, for\r\nthe reason that their mother has much milk, and are soon ready for the\r\nbutcher. Inferior animals, on account of a smaller supply of milk, are\r\nthin, and often malicious, of little value, and remain oftener in the\r\nhands of the owner. Thus are sacrificed the good bulls, and the bad are\r\nkept. Therefore, always select the choicest when they are young, to\r\nimprove the race.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen, Guenon divided his bulls into three classes: The\r\ngood, the mediocre, and the bad. He also divided them into three sizes:\r\nThe high, the medium, and the low. But he makes no difference between the\r\nthree sizes of bulls in his description of the escutcheon. He describes\r\neach one of the three principal orders, leaving to the practitioner to\r\ndetermine the intermediate degrees between the good and the mediocre, and\r\nbetween the mediocre and the bad.\r\n\r\nWe do not repeat his descriptions, as they are based upon those of the\r\ncows of the same classes, and the engravings tell the whole story. We\r\nreproduce the engravings of the good and mediocre. But very occasionally\r\nis one of the “rare” ones observed, but he says the Curved-line is the\r\nmost usual, then the Limousine, and lastly the Horizontal. What we\r\ngive is quite sufficient for all practical purposes. We advise all to\r\ncarefully select their breeding animal, which will, in most cases, be\r\nfrom among what he calls the “mediocre.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class I.—Flanders Bull._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class II.—Left Flanders Bull._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class III.—Selvage Bulls._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class IV.—Curveline Bulls._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class V.—Bicorn Bulls._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class VI.—Double Selvage Bulls._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class VII.—Demijohn Bulls._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class VIII.—Square Bulls._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Class IX.—Limousine Bulls._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA GUENON COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the Board held January 2, 1878, it was\r\n\r\n“_Resolved_, That the president of the Board (His Excellency Governor\r\nJohn F.

HAZARD, _West Chester_.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Guenon Commission having been appointed “to investigate\r\nand test the Guenon or Milk Escutcheon theory, and report the result\r\nthereof,” respectfully report that they have examined two hundred\r\ncows, heifers, and bulls, and the result of their examinations has\r\nbeen to convince themselves and others of the merits of the system, of\r\nits exceeding value to the practical farmer; and they believe that if\r\ngenerally followed for twenty years, the value of the neat cattle of the\r\nState would be increased vastly, the amount of milk and butter produced\r\nwould be much larger, and the quality of both articles better, while the\r\nquality of the meat would be improved. Having believed in and practised\r\nthe system for many years, they would add that their recent extended and\r\ncareful examinations and contact with a number of owners of all grades of\r\nstock, has tended to confirm them more thoroughly in their belief. As an\r\nadjunct to previous knowledge to assist purchasers or breeders of cattle\r\nin getting or raising the best, and weeding out the poorest, they think\r\nit is worthy of being acquired by every farmer. And they would recommend\r\ntheir fellow farmers not to be dismayed at the apparent difficulties\r\nto be surmounted in obtaining a knowledge of the system, as it is only\r\nabsolutely necessary to acquire a knowledge of the first four orders\r\nof each class, and a few other points, to practically apply it, as all\r\nanimals below those grades are not worthy of being kept. Any intelligent\r\nman can readily master the system, and soon become proficient in it by\r\npractice. This knowledge, applied with the tests heretofore usually used,\r\nwill enable any one to become a good judge of cattle.\r\n\r\nThe manner of making up their account of each animal is to examine the\r\nescutcheon and the udder, from which they place her in the class and\r\norder nearest to those delineated by Guenon, and then estimate the\r\nquantity, quality, and time that she will milk. These estimates must be,\r\nof course, only _approximate_, as they are based upon the indications of\r\nthe escutcheon, the size of the cow, and her probable condition. As it\r\nis readily seen that where estimates are based upon what the cow should\r\ndo _within three months of her being fresh_, it would be impossible to\r\nalways grade the exact value of all the cows in a herd, each of which is\r\nat a different period of gestation, or in a different condition or state\r\nof health, and where also the cow is affected by the way in which she is\r\nfed and cared for, by the season, by the state of the temperature, and\r\nother circumstances. The estimates are based upon what the commission\r\nthinks the cow would do when all the conditions are favorable to her\r\ndevelopment, and where she is properly fed and cared for. A record is\r\nmade by the commission on the spot. An account of the qualities of each\r\nhead is drawn up by the owner. Each is made at separate times, and\r\nwithout the knowledge of the other party. Then the two accounts are\r\ncopied off into parallel columns for comparison. If the accounts agree in\r\nseventy-five per cent. out of one hundred, it certainly must be presumed\r\nthe system has sufficient value to make it worthy of adoption by all\r\nfarmers and breeders. As every farmer knows the yield is much influenced\r\nby the feed, the care, the exposure, and the treatment of the cows;\r\ntherefore, a certain amount of allowance must be made, for these various\r\nthings will so alter matters, that no one can tell to a quart, or a pound\r\nof butter, or to the week in time of milking. In fact, every farmer knows\r\nneither the owner himself, nor his man, can tell to a quart how much\r\nhis cow or cows actually give, unless a daily record is kept every day\r\nof every year. For even if he does keep such a record, he will find the\r\nvarious circumstances named above affecting the quantities in his record.\r\nTherefore the earnest seeker after truth, comparing the statements\r\nmade in the two columns, must not expect the two to tally without some\r\nvariations. The true spirit with which he must examine these statements,\r\nwill suggest itself in the question: Is this a system by which I can\r\njudge of the value and quantities of a cow correctly? Is this a system\r\nthat will tell me the points of a cow, good or bad, more correctly than\r\nby any other method? Let the candid inquirer weigh these statements,\r\nand think if he knows of any method by which he can go into a herd and\r\nsurely pick out the best cows, and leave the poor ones to those who judge\r\nnot by this system. Every farmer has his own mode of judging, but take\r\nthe shrewdest and most practiced, can he avoid often the bastards? What\r\nthe commission find they can do, is that in a large majority of the\r\npercentage of cases, they will give a good estimate of the qualities of\r\nany animal. Their opinions of the time a cow will go, is based upon what\r\nthey think should be the treatment of all cows, viz.: that every cow\r\nshould have a rest of from four to six weeks, at least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERSEY COW NIOBE, H.

Viewed May 10.\r\n\r\nPresent, Messrs.

And we are more confirmed in our previous\r\n    belief in the value of the system, as we never buy a cow for a\r\n    good one that is not well marked.

Harvey’s Stock of Jerseys and Guernseys, May 11,\r\n1878.\r\n\r\n    In this examination two cows which had already been examined\r\n    and reported upon by the commission were, without their\r\n    knowledge, afterwards brought up for another examination, in\r\n    which their opinion as recorded, agreed almost exactly with the\r\n    one previously recorded, thus affording a strong proof of the\r\n    value of the system. See reports of No. 1, Betsy, and Nos. 4\r\n    and 20, Beauty. (Secretary of Board of Agriculture.)\r\n\r\nThis herd is one of the finest in the State. The cows are kept in good\r\ncondition, and being well fed, the yield is very large per head. Their\r\nproduct is first class butter, and should bring the highest price in the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe commission examined, in addition to the twenty-five cows on this\r\nlist, Mr. Harvey’s Guernsey imported bull “Sir Champion,” which is\r\nthoroughly well marked; perhaps, the best marked bull in the country. The\r\nvalue of his get is, therefore, very decided. It shows most conclusively\r\nthe importance of a bull from good milking stock, and that he should have\r\na good escutcheon. The importance of a good sire to stamp his qualities\r\nupon his descendants was conclusively proved by Mr. Harvey’s younger\r\nstock. The commission examined a young bull of seven months age, which\r\nwas as perfectly and beautifully marked as his sire, and as nearly the\r\nsame shape escutcheon as his sire’s as could possibly be. Mr. Harvey has\r\nsince sold him for $100, to Colonel R. M. Hoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Escutcheon of Imported Guernsey Bull “Sir Champion.”]\r\n\r\nNos. 9½ and 9¾ prove also the gain to a herd from a well marked bull.\r\nThese were yearlings of Champion’s get. No. 9½ was a great improvement\r\nupon the mother, No. 9, Carrie, of this list.\r\n\r\nIn the statements of the commission as to quantity, they have not\r\nmentioned the number of quarts, as the amounts given by most of this herd\r\nare superior to the generality, even of Guernseys; and, owing to good\r\nselection and careful handling by their owner, the commission judge that\r\nthe number of quarts would be larger than usual.\r\n\r\n  STOCK OF THOMAS M.

His whole stock\r\nis well-fed and cared for, and are in fine condition. He supplies\r\nMiddletown with the best of milk. Colonel Young does not keep a record\r\nof the performances of his cows, and the commission were therefore\r\nobliged to examine the cows, and after making their record, to compare\r\nit, item by item of each cow separately, with the knowledge of them had\r\nby his very intelligent dairy-woman, who has charge of the cows and the\r\nmilk, and knows their characters as milk and butter producers well; also\r\nhas a record of the times of calving of all the cows. The estimates of\r\nthe commission agreed with hers, on all the hundred and eleven points,\r\nexcept nine points, and where they differed, that difference was in two\r\ncases on the quality, and in the other cases on the time. The commission\r\nattribute their unanimity on this herd, to the careful selection and\r\nbreeding of Colonel Young, to his good feeding, and the excellent care\r\nthat the animals have. These points constantly looked after, maintain the\r\nexcellence of the herd, and as a consequence the escutcheons correspond,\r\nfor, as the colonel says, “he never saw a good escutcheon without being\r\non a good animal, and never saw a good animal without a good escutcheon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    MIDDLETOWN, _November 1, 1878_.\r\n\r\n    “We were present when the commission visited our farms, and\r\n    examined the stock, and we think they judged rightly of it, in\r\n    nearly every case—we should say within five per cent. of being\r\n    entirely correct.\r\n\r\n    We have examined the account to be printed with the original\r\n    record, and find it to be correct and corresponding.\r\n\r\n                                                   JAMES YOUNG,\r\n                                                   JAMES S.

This gentleman has seven farms, containing nine hundred\r\nacres, and keeps a variety of stock. On the farm visited, near the\r\nreservoir, the commission examined eight head of grade stock, in very\r\ngood order, on good September pasturage. The dairyman, a very intelligent\r\nman, had no record of the exact quantity and quality of the stock, but,\r\nas he milked them himself, a knowledge of their general qualities; and\r\nupon hearing the decision of the commission upon each cow, assented to\r\nthe character given of all of them, except on two points: on one as to\r\nyield, and on another as to time. It was pleasing to notice the surprise\r\nand delight expressed by him at the exhibition, of entire strangers to\r\nthe herd, of such accurate knowledge of them as the system showed it\r\ncould give. And he determined to acquire it forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe commission saw a very fine black grade cow, with the calf by her side\r\na perfect specimen of the Belted stock, though sired by a thorough-bred\r\nJersey bull—to be accounted for only by the fact that the cow had been\r\nserved by a Belted bull the third time before this one.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamination of Several Herds near West Grove, Blanketed and Unblanketed,\r\nunder the Supervision of a Committee of the Experimental Farm Club.\r\n\r\nIt had been stated by some that the commission used the ordinary means of\r\njudging of the value of cows, in addition to the Guenon tests. This was,\r\nof course, entirely denied by the commission; and as it was repeated in\r\nthe public print, the commission, to settle the matter in the minds of\r\ncandid men, offered to have any number of cows blanketed, so that only\r\ntheir posteriors could be seen, and then judge of their escutcheons,\r\nprovided a committee should be present at the examination, view it\r\nclosely, and give a report. Thus pressed, the challenge was accepted, and\r\nthere was appointed a committee of five of some of the best farmers and\r\ndairymen residing near the Experimental farm. It was also understood that\r\nany could attend who wished to, and on the day of the examination three\r\nof the committee were present, as well as a number of other farmers. The\r\ncommission examined the first five in the stable, blanketed, then two\r\nunblanketed, then two blanketed, and the remaining four unblanketed. The\r\nreport of this committee is appended herewith. The cows were examined on\r\na farm of Thomas Gawthrop, near West Grove. Afterward a number of cows\r\nwere examined on several farms in the neighborhood, in the presence of\r\nthe committee. No longer time was required to form an opinion on the\r\nblanketed cows than on the others, and the comparative results can be\r\njudged from the accompanying tables.\r\n\r\nThe commission met them on the day appointed, at the farm of Thomas\r\nGawthrop, and in the presence of the committee (three being present,) and\r\nof others, examined seven cows blanketed, and would have examined more,\r\nbut the committee said it was useless, as they could see, and had full\r\nfaith that only the escutcheon was considered by the commission. On this\r\nfarm thirteen head were examined, and the results are herewith given. All\r\nthen adjourned to the farms of Mark Hughes, Howard Preston, and Everard\r\nConard, and examined other stock in the presence of the committee. The\r\ncommittee’s report will be found annexed, thus setting to rest the charge\r\nthat the commission were examining by any other than the Guenon test.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS GAWTHROP’S ACCOUNT OF COWS|THE GUENON COMMISSION’S ACCOUNT OF\r\n    EXAMINED AT THOMAS GAWTHROP’S  |  COWS EXAMINED AT THOMAS GAWTHROP’S\r\n    FARM, SEPTEMBER 20.            |  FARM, SEPTEMBER 20.\r\n                                   |\r\n  _No. 1._—VICTORIA.—Grade, Jersey |_No. 1._—VICTORIA.*—Grade, Jersey and\r\n      and Durham.                  |  Durham.

Darlington’s Cows, October 2d.\r\n\r\nThe commission visited the herds of Messrs. J. & J. Darlington, October\r\n2, at Darlington station, on Westchester road, Delaware county. These\r\ngentlemen make the finest butter and get the largest price in the market.\r\nTheir dairy is admirably arranged. They have farms of four hundred and\r\neighty acres, and have a herd of one hundred and sixty-seven cows. They\r\nhad selected about a fair sample of the herd in two lots of cows. The\r\nfirst lot, from No. 9 to 33, was on one farm, and those numbered from 1\r\nto 14 on the other farm. These gentlemen kept no test of the quality of\r\nany cow’s milk, and have no exact record of the quantity given by any\r\ncow; but as they are experienced dairymen, and thoroughly practical men,\r\nthey knew about what each cow was giving in milk, and about its general\r\nquality, and sufficient to pronounce the grade of each cow, whether\r\nfirst, second, or third class. Therefore, in their record they do not\r\ngive the exact record, as the committee would have desired, so as to\r\ncompare with their own estimates, but they give the general qualities\r\nof the cow, and the two records must be compared from that stand point.\r\nAnother matter must be taken into consideration. The Messrs. Darlington\r\nare liberal feeders, which accounts partly for their rich, tasty butter,\r\nand tends to make their cows do full work. A standard of quarts for\r\nfirst, second, and third class, upon which to estimate the qualities of\r\nthe cows, was agreed upon between the commission and Messrs. Darlington.\r\n\r\n  J. & J.

They, of course, expect that not only their report, but also the\r\ncorrectness of the system, will be criticised; but if this criticism is\r\nconducted with a spirit of fairness, and with a view to obtain the truth,\r\nthey fully believe the result will be favorable.\r\n\r\nBy direction of the commission.\r\n\r\n                                                  WILLIS P. HAZARD,\r\n                                                    _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a commission by Governor Hartranft, in 1878, to\r\ninvestigate and verify the theories of M. Guenon in judging and selecting\r\nmilch cows, has resulted in much good to the agricultural community. The\r\nmembers of that commission, including Mr. George Blight, who acted upon\r\na similar committee in 1853, thoroughly imbued with the accuracy of the\r\nsystem and the desire to extend its usefulness, have continued to explain\r\nthis mode of selecting cows whenever an opportunity offered. This has\r\nbeen very frequent, and many hundred cows have been examined in public,\r\nand the system explained in every section of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that all other modes of judging cows do not militate\r\nagainst M. Guenon’s views; they give the judge only a more certain mode,\r\nand, if he has had much practice, a nearly infallible one. There are some\r\npoints which are in full unison with Guenon’s views, but do not appear in\r\nhis work, and may be spoken of as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. All bovine animals have on the skin of the back a _quirl in the\r\nhair_, which seems to be a sort of dividing line or point between the\r\nhair on the front of the animal and that on the hinder portion. This\r\nshould be found in the center of the ridge of the animal, that is,\r\nequi-distant from the head as from the root of the tail, and should be\r\nwell defined, but of short fine hair. Frequently it is to be seen on the\r\nshoulder; when there, coarse hair is generally the accompaniment, and\r\nwith that, a thick or tough skin, and no great milking qualities, or if\r\nmuch milk is given, it is not for a long time, nor is the milk of rich\r\nquality. The heaviest milkers have this mark, usually on the middle of\r\nthe back, and the richest, with short fine hair. In short, the nearer the\r\nmiddle of the back, and the smaller the quirl and the finer the hair,\r\nthe most generally will the cow be the better milker and of the richest\r\nquality. This mark Mr. Blight and myself have been testing for a long\r\ntime, and we feel now that we can recommend it as a very good additional\r\npoint to judge from.\r\n\r\n2d. The tail should be long and squarely placed on the animal at the\r\nroot, and of thin fine quality, with a good curly or corkscrew switch,\r\nand the bone of the tail should extend fully down to the knee and as\r\nmuch below it as possible. The horns should be small, waxy, and crumpled\r\ninwards and downwards a little. If they are long, they should be thin and\r\nsometimes rather flat.\r\n\r\n3d. Bulls; the same remarks apply to these. Their hind legs should\r\nresemble, as much as possible, those of the cow, with great length\r\nbetween the hoof and the first joint; this indicates their aptitude to\r\nbeget heifer calves and good milkers.\r\n\r\n4th. On raising calves, proper nourishment should be given; if stinted,\r\nthe inferior parts develop to the injury of the better; the head and\r\nhorns will be out of proportion to the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Breeding and Value of well-selected Butter Cows.\r\n\r\nWe have frequently endeavored to show that one of the most important\r\nadvantages of Guenon’s system is, that it enables every owner of cows\r\nto tell the good from the bad cows, and that by weeding out the poor\r\nones, and raising the tone of his herd, he will increase his profits,\r\nand if every farmer in the State will do the same, the increased value\r\nof all herds, and the increased results in profits, would amount to many\r\nmillions yearly.\r\n\r\nPertinent to this subject, Mr. J. H. Walker, of Worcester, Massachusetts,\r\nthe owner of a very choice herd of Jerseys, embracing members of the\r\nAlphea, Victor, and Pansy families, has prepared an article on the\r\nBREEDING AND VALUE OF BUTTER COWS, which proves, by tables showing the\r\nnet results of good and bad cows, the theory that good cows will pay\r\nbetter than poor ones as an investment. We digest his remarks as follows:\r\n\r\nIn New England, a pound of butter can be made for less money than a pound\r\nand a half of beef, taking the animals at birth or beginning with animals\r\ntwo years old.\r\n\r\nTaking any good herd of Jersey cows, old and young, from the time the\r\nheifers first come in milk, and it will average to make two thirds as\r\nmany pounds of butter per annum as any person in New England can make in\r\npounds of beef, on any herd of any breed.\r\n\r\nThe beef is worth six to nine cents, and the butter from twenty to forty\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, every farmer should know what the difference is in the\r\nactual value of the different cows he owns, rating their value upon the\r\nmoney he gets for their product.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary cow will make about two hundred pounds of butter a year.\r\nThe tables are intended to show what the difference is in the value of\r\ndifferent cows for producing butter, taking as a basis the payment of\r\nthirty dollars for a cow that will make two hundred pounds of butter per\r\nannum, and for different amounts up to six hundred pounds per annum,\r\nassuming that the cow will die at twelve years of age. The interest\r\nupon the first cost of the cow, and on her product for each year, is\r\ncompounded at the rate of six per cent. per annum, up to the day it is\r\nassumed the cow will die, taking no account of the value of the stock\r\nbred from her.\r\n\r\nAs long as every business is done upon the basis of interest on\r\ninvestments, we must treat the question of values as applied to cows on\r\nthat basis. This is the only way to accurately prove the difference in\r\nvalue between one cow and another.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable A.\r\n\r\nIf the cow cost thirty dollars, the keeping per annum twenty-five\r\ndollars, and the butter sells for twenty-five cents a pound, the\r\n_profits_ on the cows will be as follows, viz:\r\n\r\n  Paying $30 00 for a 200 pound cow, he will get in ten years,  $170 00\r\n    ”    189 97  ”    300      ”        ”             ”          235 03\r\n    ”    348 86  ”    400      ”        ”             ”          299 89\r\n    ”    504 39  ”    500      ”        ”             ”          363 11\r\n    ”    671 61  ”    600      ”        ”             ”          428 39\r\n\r\n\r\nTable B.\r\n\r\n_Including interest_ on all items, a farmer will make on each cow as\r\nfollows, (made on a basis of twenty-five cents a pound for butter, and\r\ntwenty-five dollars a year for keeping,) viz:\r\n\r\n  Paying $30 00 for a 200 pound cow, he will get in ten years,  $195 73\r\n    ”    125 00  ”    300      ”        ”             ”          313 06\r\n    ”    250 00  ”    400      ”        ”             ”          374 15\r\n    ”    350 00  ”    500      ”        ”             ”          474 52\r\n    ”    450 00  ”    600      ”        ”             ”          595 91\r\n\r\n\r\nTable C.\r\n\r\nReckoning the annual cost of keeping at thirty-five dollars, and butter\r\nat thirty cents a pound, _reckoning interest_ on her cost, and on all\r\nreceipts from her, a farmer will make on each cow as follows, viz:\r\n\r\n  Paying $30 00 for a 200 pound cow, he will get in ten years,  $182 87\r\n    ”    125 00  ”    300      ”        ”             ”          354 78\r\n    ”    250 00  ”    400      ”        ”             ”          483 49\r\n    ”    350 00  ”    500      ”        ”             ”          654 17\r\n    ”    450 00  ”    600      ”        ”             ”          811 59\r\n\r\n\r\nTable D.\r\n\r\nOn an annual cost of keeping of fifty dollars, and price of butter at\r\nthirty-five cents:\r\n\r\n  Paying $30 00 for a 200 pound cow, he will get in ten years,   $95 76\r\n    ”    125 00  ”    300      ”        ”             ”          318 39\r\n    ”    250 00  ”    400      ”        ”             ”          507 46\r\n    ”    350 00  ”    500      ”        ”             ”          744 20\r\n    ”    450 00  ”    600      ”        ”             ”          960 90\r\n\r\nAssuming that each cow, costing at two years old the price named in\r\nthe tables, will die at twelve years old, the actual value of cows to\r\npractical farmers, making annually the different amounts of butter named,\r\nis shown.\r\n\r\nThey show what the cow will make in the ten years, and also what a farmer\r\ncan afford to pay for each cow making the different amounts of butter\r\nnamed. They show the different amounts the farmer, who buys one of each\r\nof the cows named, paying the prices named for each of the five, will\r\nmake on each, provided no interest is reckoned on the price paid for the\r\ncow, or on the butter made from her, during ten years.\r\n\r\nThese figures are certainly startling to any one who has not taken the\r\ntrouble to examine this subject, much more so to the farmer who never\r\nfigures carefully, and does exactly as his father did before him, without\r\nregard to the altered circumstances that surround him.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who shakes his head wisely at his more enterprising neighbor,\r\nand insists that cows making as much butter as is mentioned in these five\r\ntables do not live and never did, should know that the thorough-bred\r\nJersey cows, Jersey Belle of Scituate, of the Victor family, made 705\r\npounds of butter in twelve consecutive months; that Eurotas, of the\r\nAlphia family, made 778 pounds of butter between November 12, 1879,\r\nand October 15, 1880, and dropped a heifer calf on November 4, 1880;\r\nthat Pansy, sired by Living Storm, dam Dolly 2d, sired by Emperor 2d,\r\nmade in her four year old form 574 pounds of butter in one year; that\r\nimported Flora made 511 pounds of butter in fifty weeks; that Countess\r\nmade 16 pounds of butter on grass only, when fourteen years old. These\r\nwell-established facts no intelligent, fair-minded man now disputes,\r\nand it is confidently believed that many more Jerseys will make as much\r\nbutter as have any of those mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe question which at once suggests itself to farmers who are not\r\nsatisfied with their present animals, is that of capital. The answer is,\r\n“admitting the above figures to be correct, I have no capital to pay\r\nthe high prices demanded for the best Jersey cows, and I must therefore\r\nforego that improvement of my herd, which I know I ought to make.” Let us\r\nsee if this is so.\r\n\r\nBy any process of reasoning, the “bull is half the herd.” Each cow\r\ncontributes to one calf each year half its qualities. The bull\r\ncontributes to every calf produced in the herd half its qualities. Some\r\nhorse-breeders will talk only of the excellences of the stallion. Some\r\nfarmers will talk only of the excellences of the cows. Both are mistaken.\r\nThe sire and the dam, each contribute to their offspring, on the\r\naverage, exactly the same proportion of their excellences or defects.\r\n\r\nSome bulls are so powerfully organized as to be able to stamp their\r\nqualities, good or bad, on nearly every one of their progeny, as are some\r\ncows; but these are the rare exceptions. Each contribute the same, as\r\na rule. No scientific investigator of the breeding problem, or careful\r\nbreeder, would any sooner select the offspring of a 600 pound butter cow,\r\ngot by a bull from a 200 pound butter family, than he would a heifer got\r\nby a full brother to the 600 pound butter cow from a full sister to the\r\n200 pound butter bull.\r\n\r\nUsing a bull from a 400 pound butter family, on heifers from a 200 pound\r\nbutter family, is just as likely to produce heifers that will make from\r\ntwo hundred to four hundred pounds of butter annually, averaging a yield\r\nof three hundred pounds; as the using of a bull from a 200 pound butter\r\nfamily on cows of a 400 pound butter family, would be to reduce the yield\r\nof some of the heifers to two hundred pounds, and the average to three\r\nhundred pounds. The increasing the butter yield of the heifers from a\r\nherd of cows one half by using a bull on them from a family or breed that\r\nmake twice as much, or the reverse, can be relied upon as certainly as\r\nany expected result in the most uncertain of all business, namely: that\r\nof breeding.\r\n\r\nIf these statements are correct, what had a farmer better pay for a bull\r\nfrom a 400 pound butter family, to use on his herd of ten 200 pound\r\nbutter cows, rather than use a bull from a 200 pound butter family?\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the keeping would cost more, because the higher bred\r\nproduct must be kept better. There is some truth in this, but the better\r\nkeeping would affect favorably the poorer animals as well, and whatever\r\nthe extra feed would cost, it would carry the value of the average yield\r\nas much above the figures we are making, as the extra feed would cost.\r\n\r\nThe ten 200 pound butter cows, in ten years would pay a profit of $1,957\r\n30. If the ten cows bred from them, by using the 400 pound butter bull,\r\nwould make half as much again butter at the same cost, the general\r\nproduct would be increased by one half, and leave the sum to be deducted\r\nfor keeping the same, for if the two year old 200 pound butter heifer\r\ncould be raised for $30, so could the better bred one. The profit on\r\neach of them, deducting $54 18, cost of cow, will be $484 64—on the ten,\r\n$4,846 40, and on the 200 pound butter cows, the profits would be $1,957\r\n30. The advantages reaped by the farmer who has the product for ten years\r\nof heifers bred by using the better bull, will be $2,889 10 more than on\r\nthe 200 pound butter cows.\r\n\r\nIf he paid for his bull $1,500, and the bull and all his cows died at\r\ntwelve years old, the farmer would be as well off as he would have been\r\nto have used the 200 pound butter bull.\r\n\r\nBut there is no necessity of paying $1,500 for a 400 pound butter\r\nbull. One hundred dollars will buy a Jersey bull, six weeks old, from\r\na 400 pound butter family, and he will be old enough to use in twelve\r\nmonths. The $100 paid for him, at six per cent. compound interest,\r\nwould amount to $191 61, in eleven years. The profit on ten butter cows\r\nmaking three hundred pounds over the ten cows making two hundred pounds\r\nin ten years, being $2,800, by deducting the $191 61 for the bull that\r\nproduced them, (counting nothing for the 200 pound butter bull, for he\r\nis good-for-nothing,) the actual advantage reaped by the farmer with\r\nintelligence and enterprise enough to secure the better bull, in the ten\r\nyears after his heifers come in, is over $2,500 on the butter alone. The\r\nanimals are counted of no value when twelve years old, as the price got\r\nfor those living beyond that age would average to pay only for the losses\r\ncaused by accident to animals before reaching that age. These figures\r\ntake no account of the skim-milk or buttermilk, for they are nearly\r\nthe same in either case, and will pay the taxes and for the care of the\r\nanimals; but there is one very important source of profit that is not\r\nreckoned, and that is the extra value of the progeny, which is shown by\r\nthe following table, to be $17,424 48.\r\n\r\nThere must be no mistake made in procuring a Jersey bull calf.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as a breed, they are twice to three times as valuable for\r\nbutter as common cows, yet any farmer who buys or uses a Jersey bull,\r\nbecause he is a Jersey bull, will sorely repent his venture.\r\n\r\nBuy a bull only from the very best families of Jerseys. They are cheaper\r\nthan the gift of an average good one.\r\n\r\nThe idea that it costs more to keep Jersey cows than common cows, or that\r\nJersey cows will not take on flesh, for beef, as readily as other breeds,\r\nis true in one view, and very erroneous in another and more correct one.\r\n\r\nWhat a Jersey eats, beyond a limited amount, increases the quantity and\r\nrichness of her milk, not her flesh, and the amount of flesh she carries\r\nis proportionally less for any extra feed, because it does not make\r\nflesh, but increases the butter globules in her milk. Again, any other\r\nbreed can be readily dried off at any time, and being dry, or giving but\r\nlittle milk, and that of poor quality, they readily take on flesh, but a\r\ngood Jersey is “dried off” with great difficulty, and herein she greatly\r\nexcels all other breeds. Hundreds of Jerseys, milking twelve to sixteen\r\nquarts at their flush, hold out so evenly, that they will give many more\r\nquarts of milk, and of double the richness, in a year, than eighteen to\r\ntwenty-four quart cows, of other families, that are dry several months of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nIt is the experience of every breeder of Jerseys that, _being dry_, they\r\nwill take on flesh as fast, with a given quantity and quality of feed, as\r\nother breeds, not exclusively beef producers.\r\n\r\nThey are not good for beef, simply because they are good for butter.\r\n\r\nFrom Jersey cows, a farmer in New England can make a pound of butter\r\nworth thirty-five cents, with a less quantity of food than they now use\r\nto make a pound and one half of beef worth nine cents.\r\n\r\nIf farmers think there is some error in these statements, they will,\r\nlike sensible men whose prosperity depends upon the result, sit down and\r\nfigure out the results for themselves.\r\n\r\nThose who talk loudest against them, will hold on to a cow in their herd\r\nthat has a little Jersey blood in her; and if they put a price on her, it\r\nwill be from half as much again, to double that of the finer formed cow\r\nstanding beside her, guiltless of having any Jersey blood in her veins.\r\n\r\nIf there is an animal to be had any better than the bull any one is now\r\nusing, it ought to be secured at once. So with cows, but by all means\r\nchange at once for a better, any bull, however good.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed for any of the tables herewith presented, that they\r\nshow absolutely the value of any cow to any farmer, but only that they\r\nare relatively correct. Every man who consults them, must make his own\r\nadjustments as to cost and receipts on any cow he owns. It is clear, that\r\nadding a very little to the cost of keeping, and deducting a very little\r\nfrom the price of butter, will show that any 200 pound butter cow brings\r\nher owner in debt, each year. Again, there are probably hundreds of cows\r\nkept for the dairy, that will not make two hundred pounds of butter in\r\none year on the same feed Jersey Belle of Scituate, had when she made\r\nseven hundred and five pounds of butter in one year. It may be said\r\nthat no allowance is made for any accidents to which a cow is liable—to\r\nabort, to have a calf die at birth, to injury, &c., and the thought is\r\npresent that the loss on the poorer animal is not so much, in that case,\r\nas on the better; but the better is no more liable to such a case, and\r\nthe loss is nearly the same proportionally. But it is still true, that\r\nthe nearer to absolute worthlessness animals are, the less the loss,\r\nrelatively and absolutely, their owner suffers in their injury. Better\r\nremember, however, that “blessed be nothing” is not the ejaculation of\r\nthe healthful, the enterprising, and the successful, but of desperate\r\ndisease, incapacity, or idleness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable E.\r\n\r\nShowing the value of the progeny of a herd of 32 cows, that each make\r\n300 pounds of butter annually, at the expiration of ten years, together\r\nwith the value of the butter the progeny will have made during the ten\r\nyears. Also showing the same on a herd of 32 cows, each making 200 pounds\r\nof butter annually. No account is taken of the bull calves, for they are\r\nworth nothing. No one can afford to use a bull, however good, if one is\r\nto be had that is any better.\r\n\r\n    ================================================================\r\n

The arguments for and\r\nagainst are also set forth, with proofs of the value of the system. Our\r\ndairymen would do well to study the subject and be able to guess as well\r\nas the members of the commission on the value of the cows examined by\r\nthem.”—_American Dairymen._\r\n\r\n“In itself, the system is very simple, and, with care, easily understood;\r\nand, taking into consideration its great importance, should be studied\r\nand acquired by all who are directly or indirectly interested in farming,\r\nand as so many opportunities are offering to obtain a practical knowledge\r\nof the method, there can be no excuse for ignorance any longer. The\r\nsystem of judging the value of cows has become so thoroughly arranged\r\nthat with a little practice, enough can be learned from it in a short\r\ntime to serve any one making use of it, and thereby avoiding loss.\r\n\r\n“The bulls are found marked with corresponding designs, as far as the sex\r\npermits, which indicate unerringly their good and poor qualities; and\r\nthus by a wise use of the knowledge acquired through the Guenon method,\r\nstock breeders can judiciously, and with almost certainty, select their\r\ncattle for the purposes in view, either for milking, butter-making,\r\nor beef, according to their desire, for all these results follow its\r\nteachings.”—_State Fair Daily._\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hazard has given us a most interesting work upon a system that\r\nhas gained the respect and consideration of thinking farmers the world\r\nover.”—_Farm and Fireside, Springfield, Ohio._\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hazard is, no doubt, the best posted supporter of the system in this\r\ncountry, and may be regarded as authority. If his recommendations for\r\nthe selection of dairy stock are worthless then the whole Guenon system\r\nmay be condemned as being utterly fallacious. His book deserves careful\r\nattention from intelligent farmers.”—_Bucks County Intelligencer._\r\n\r\n“In a majority of cases, the marks have been reliable, and this should\r\nincite all dairy folks to know what is said about it.”—_Meehan’s\r\nGardner’s Monthly._\r\n\r\n“It embraces a sketch of Guenon, and the progress of his discovery;\r\nextracts from his preface explaining his views; an explanation of his\r\nsystem of escutcheon marks; descriptions of the various escutcheons and\r\ntheir indications of value and quantity, and directions how to apply them\r\nin practice, together with the report of the commission of which the\r\nauthor served as secretary. Nearly one hundred illustrations are given,\r\nthose of the escutcheons being photographed from the drawings in Guenon’s\r\nlast revised edition.”—_Country Gentleman and Cultivator._\r\n\r\n“Remarkable as was M. Guenon’s method, and although his discoveries were\r\nduly made known in this country, this is the first time that his methods\r\nhave been compiled for practical use. By the use of this little handbook,\r\nthere can be no doubt, but that farmers and stock raisers would save a\r\nvast amount of money. The explanations are simple and easily followed,\r\nthe numerous illustrations serving to elucidate the text.”—_Boston\r\nEvening Traveler._\r\n\r\n“Beginning with a little sketch of the method of the birth of the system\r\nin Guenon’s mind, the author goes on in a clear and concise manner to\r\nexplain by plain language and appropriate drawings, the various so\r\ncalled ‘milk mirrors’ and their values, being properly understood,\r\nas aids in selecting good dairy stock. The various opinions of those\r\nadverse to the ‘theory’ are fairly discussed, and the reports of various\r\nagricultural societies which have from time to time investigated it\r\nare given, together with the report of the Pennsylvania commission.\r\nTaken altogether, Mr. Hazard has succeeded in making a very readable,\r\ninteresting and valuable book, and one which, whatever may or may not\r\nbe the preconceived ideas of its reader, cannot fail to interest and\r\ninstruct him upon a subject which should be far better understood amongst\r\nfarmers generally, than it at present is.”—_New England Homestead._\r\n\r\n“A very valuable pamphlet. Mr. Hazard has devoted great attention and\r\nstudy to the subject, with a view of rendering the system popular, and we\r\nhappen to know that his work is largely appreciated, especially by the\r\nfarmers of New England, from the number of orders received for the book.\r\nThe discovery made by Mr. Guenon, and the practical principles founded on\r\nit are invaluable, and the saving to the country by its general knowledge\r\nwill be very great. The State of Pennsylvania, in 1878, appointed a\r\ncommission to test the system and report on it. Mr. Hazard was a member\r\nof the commission, and has added the results of much study and research.\r\nHe has been invited to lecture and present the subject at the annual\r\nmeeting of the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture, at Greenfield,\r\nand has many invitations and engagements in other places.”—_Massachusetts\r\nPloughman._\r\n\r\n“This volume embraces all the essential matters in Guenon’s treatise.\r\nIt is really a valuable contribution to dairy literature.”—_Southern\r\nCultivator._\r\n\r\n“Every farmer should study Guenon.”—_Farm Journal._\r\n\r\n“Dairymen and stock raisers should send for a copy.”—_Rural Nebraska._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM THE MUCH LARGER NOTICES OF THE WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO SELECT COWS; OR, THE GUENON SYSTEM EXPLAINED. By _Willis P.\r\nHazard_. In no way is the march of improvement in agriculture more\r\ndecided than in the new discoveries and new methods of developing its\r\nresources. It is owing to these that America is now the granary of the\r\nworld, and, as years roll by, if the developments of the next decade\r\nare as great in proportion as the last ones, no matter how extensive\r\nthe foreign demand, there will be an ample supply at still lower prices\r\nthan at the present. No branch of agricultural interests has changed\r\nso much and received such an impetus, especially within the last five\r\nyears, as the dairy. Entire new modes of making butter and cheese and\r\nof setting milk have largely taken place of the old ones. Competition\r\nin making dairy products becomes keener each year, and every process by\r\nwhich the labor can be lessened, or the products be cheapened, meets with\r\nrecompense.\r\n\r\nThe first step, however, is in the selection of good stock, for by it the\r\nproduct of the herd is increased from twenty-five to thirty-three per\r\ncent., and, therefore, the profits must be immensely greater. The old\r\nplan of our forefathers of judging of the value of a cow by a crumpled\r\nhorn and a large bag is now set aside by recent discoveries. The most\r\nimportant and most reliable one is that of Mons. François Guenon, of\r\nLibourne, France. After a series of experiments he was convinced there\r\nwere outward marks in the hair which were an indication of the yield and\r\nquality of all cows. Patiently for many years he labored at forming his\r\ndiscoveries into a system, with classes and orders of each variation.\r\nHe was finally rewarded by the approval of all the leading agricultural\r\nsocieties in France, and by that government with a pension of three\r\nthousand francs.\r\n\r\nThe work of Guenon was partially translated and published in this country\r\nyears ago, but it was his first crude effort, and it presented the new\r\nscience in so crude a form as rather to dismay the learner than to\r\ninvite him to master it. Last year the State of Pennsylvania appointed\r\na commission of three well-known agriculturists and experts to test the\r\nsystem and report upon it. That report was printed and published to the\r\nextent of twenty-five thousand copies, which but partially supplied the\r\ndemand. Messrs. Blight, Harvey, and Hazard examined the escutcheons of\r\ntwo hundred cows, and interpreted them as regards the quantity, quality,\r\nand time of the yield of each animal. Alongside of their statements the\r\nknowledge of the owner of each cow was printed, and it is truly wonderful\r\nhow accurately the character of each cow is given by these gentlemen who\r\nhad never seen the cattle before. The gist of their report was that the\r\nsystem was invaluable and worthy of adoption by every farmer, and such\r\nadoption would add millions of value to the improved herds of the country.\r\n\r\nUpon the publication of this report, discussions took place in the\r\nleading agricultural journals, and thus has been created a demand for\r\nmore easily to be acquired knowledge upon the whole subject. Willis P.\r\nHazard, the secretary of the commission, has prepared a complete treatise\r\nupon Guenon’s system, and it has been just issued in a cheap form, for\r\nwide circulation.\r\n\r\nMr. Hazard in his book gives a sketch of the life of M. Guenon and\r\nthe progress of his system, and then fully explains it, so that in\r\nthis simplified form any one can quickly learn all the points so as\r\nto readily apply it. The opinions of others, both pro and con, are\r\nintroduced, argued, and answered, so that in this volume one gets a full\r\nhistory and account of the system, and its practical application is made\r\neasy. There is a profusion of engravings, photographed from Guenon’s\r\ndesigns, which thoroughly elucidate the text and render it a valuable\r\nhandbook which no farmer can afford to do without, and which amateur\r\nagriculturists will find a most interesting development of a wonderful\r\ndiscovery.—_Philadelphia Inquirer._\r\n\r\n“A gentleman well known among the dairymen, and who was appointed by the\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania to investigate the value and practicability of\r\nthe Guenon system. He was induced to undertake the explanation of the\r\nsystem, which he has very ably performed in this volume. The low price\r\nat which it is offered should induce every one even in the smallest\r\nmanner engaged in breeding or management of cows to procure a copy of\r\nit.”—_American Farmer, Baltimore._\r\n\r\n“At the New York State fair, in September, 1879, Mr. Hazard applied\r\nthe Guenon system to a large number of cows of different breeds on\r\nexhibition, and told the amount of milk each gave, as indicated by the\r\nescutcheon theory. A committee, with Col. F. D. Curtis as chairman, was\r\nappointed to accompany him, and they state in their report that he was\r\ngenerally accurate, not varying in any instance more than two quarts in\r\nstating the daily average yield, and in most cases giving the amount\r\nexactly, and also the time the cows would give milk. He made his estimate\r\non the average daily yield for the first three months after calving,\r\non liberal feed. In one or two instances he over rated the cows, but\r\ngenerally where there was any difference he was under the amount stated\r\nby the owners. Mr. Hazard takes into consideration in his estimates the\r\nsize of the cow and her whole contour, as well as the character of the\r\nskin. His round of observation is first the shape of the escutcheon,\r\nthen the milk veins and quality of the skin. He offered to have the cows\r\nblanketed and then tell their milking capacity, but this was not done.\r\nIt is fair to say that he judges mainly by the escutcheon. The tests\r\nattracted a large circle of breeders, who were greatly interested on\r\naccount of the novelty and general accuracy.”—_Col. Curtis in New York\r\nTribune._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's How to Select Cows, by Willis Pope Hazard",
