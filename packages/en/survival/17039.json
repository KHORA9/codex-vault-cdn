A large majority of the\r\nowners of the salmon weirs and nets along both sides of the bay and\r\nriver were interviewed and accurate accounts of their fishing obtained,\r\ntogether with their observations as to the effect of artificial\r\npropagation on the supply.\r\n\r\nThe history and methods of the salmon fishery of this basin have been\r\nwell presented in papers by Mr. Charles G. Atkins, superintendent of\r\nthe Government hatchery at Craig Brook, Maine. [1,2] The present paper\r\nis primarily intended to show the extent and condition of the salmon\r\nfishery of Penobscot Bay and River in 1895 and 1896 and the influence\r\nof artificial propagation on the supply. The methods and apparatus of\r\nthe fishery are briefly considered. A chart of the Penobscot region,\r\ngiving the location of salmon weirs and traps in use in 1896, is\r\nappended, and illustrations of some of the types of salmon apparatus\r\nare shown.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 1: On the Salmon of Eastern North America, and\r\n   its artificial culture. In Report of Commissioner of Fish\r\n   and Fisheries 1872-3, pp. 226-337, 9 plates of apparatus and\r\n   methods, and map showing location of salmon weirs in\r\n   Penobscot region.]\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 2: The River Fisheries of Maine. In The Fisheries\r\n   and Fishery Industries of the United States, section V, vol.\r\n   I, pp. 673-728.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtent and condition of the fishery in 1895 and 1896.\r\n\r\nWhile the number of nets operated in these two years was practically\r\nthe same, the catch in 1896 was much greater than in 1895, and was one\r\nof the largest in the recent history of the fishery. A comparatively\r\nlarge number of fishermen reported that they took more salmon than in\r\nany previous year. The salmon, however, were smaller than usual, and\r\ntheir market value was but little more in 1896 than in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe traps set especially for salmon, or in which salmon were taken,\r\nnumbered 193 in 1895 and 184 in 1896. These, with the accessories,\r\nhad a value of $12,474 and $13,146, respectively. The boats and scows\r\nrequired in the construction and operation of the nets numbered 188\r\nin 1895, the same in 1896, and were valued at $3,576 and $3,599,\r\nrespectively. The number of men engaged in the fishery was 127 in\r\n1895 and 126 in 1896. In the comparatively unimportant branch of the\r\nfishery carried on with gill nets in the vicinity of Bangor, 10 nets,\r\nvalued at $189, were used in 1895, and 11 nets, worth $199, in 1896;\r\nthese were set by 6 men in the first year and 7 in the next. The boats\r\nnumbered 4 in 1895 and 5 in 1896, and were valued at $29 and $37,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe total number of salmon caught in 1895 was 4,395; these weighed\r\n65,011 pounds and yielded the fishermen $11,356; in gill nets 117\r\nsalmon were caught, weighing 1,985 pounds and valued at $323. In 1896\r\nthe result of the fishery was 6,403 salmon, weighing 80,175 pounds,\r\nwith a market value of $12,716; the gill-net catch this year was 246\r\nsalmon, with a weight of 3,444 pounds and a value of $492.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the fishery in 1896 exceeded that of 1895 by 2,008\r\nsalmon; increase in weight was 15,164 pounds, and in value $1,360. The\r\npercentage of increase in these items was as follows: Fish taken, 46\r\nper cent; weight of catch, 23 per cent; value of catch, 12 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the uniform increase in the number of salmon\r\ntaken in 1896, the following facts may be cited: The nets that were\r\nset in both years numbered 162; of these, 146 nets, or 90 per cent,\r\ntook more salmon in 1896 than in 1895; and only 16, or 10 per cent,\r\ntook the same number or less. The comparative figures for the nets\r\nthat secured more fish in 1896 were 3,449 salmon in 1895 and 5,681 in\r\n1896. The nets whose catch was the same or less in 1896 caught 295\r\nfish in 1895 and 289 in 1896.\r\n\r\nThe largest number of salmon taken by one fisherman in 1895 was 408;\r\nthese were caught in 3 nets on the lower side of Sears Island, in the\r\ntownship of Searsport. Other catches by single fishermen in 1895 were\r\n104 salmon in 4 nets in Stockton, 102 in 5 nets in Northport, 150 in 3\r\nnets in Islesboro, and 150 in 3 nets in Verona.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the 3 Searsport nets first mentioned took 426 salmon, and a\r\nlarge number of fishermen secured between 100 and 200 fish in 2 to 5\r\nnets. Thus, in Stockton 100 fish were caught in 2 nets, 105 in 3 nets,\r\nand 110 in 1 net; in Penobscot 192 salmon were taken in 2 nets, 105 in\r\n2 nets, and 127 in 2 nets; in Northport 5 nets obtained 204 fish and 4\r\nnets 125 fish; in Islesboro 3 nets took 130 fish, 3 nets 150 fish, 4\r\nnets 190 fish, and 2 nets 100 fish; in Verona 3 nets caught 174 fish,\r\n2 nets 106 fish, 3 nets 150 fish, 1 net 100 fish, and 2 nets 170 fish.\r\n\r\nAbout 80 per cent of the fishing is done in that part of the river\r\nbetween the northern end of Whitmore Island and Islesboro. While\r\nsingle weirs in that part of the river between Bucksport and Bangor\r\nmay take as many as 50 or 60 salmon some seasons, the average was only\r\n14 in 1895 and 26 in 1896, and the aggregate is comparatively small.\r\nIn the townships of Lincolnville and Camden, which are the lowest\r\npoints in the Penobscot region at which salmon fishing is done, the\r\naverage catch to a net in 1895 was only 16 salmon and in 1896 only 19\r\nsalmon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed statistics for 1895 and 1896.\r\n\r\nThe following tables show, by townships, the extent of the salmon\r\nfishery of Penobscot Bay and River in 1895 and 1896:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE.

The fishery\r\nyielded 169,894 pounds, valued at $32,800, in 1887; 192,177 pounds,\r\nworth $38,049, in 1888; 140,469 pounds, valued at $31,156, in 1889,\r\nand 92,282 pounds, worth $19,124, in 1892.\r\n\r\nAs previously shown, in 1895 193 traps and 10 gill nets took 4,395\r\nsalmon, weighing 65,011 pounds, valued at $11,356, and in 1896, 184\r\ntraps and 11 gill nets caught 6,403 salmon, weighing 80,175 pounds,\r\nvalued at $12,716.\r\n\r\nComparing 1896 with 1880, it appears that there was a reduction of 27\r\nper cent in the number of nets used and a decrease of 36 per cent in\r\nthe number of salmon caught. A relatively large catch was made in 1887\r\nto 1889, inclusive, and the decrease in 1896, as compared with those\r\nyears, was marked. From 1892 to 1895 the output declined nearly 30\r\nper cent, and the general tendency for the past eight years has been\r\ntoward a decrease, 1896 presenting a very pleasing contrast, of which\r\nthe fishermen all make mention.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a continuous record from 1874 to 1896 of two of the most\r\nsuccessful salmon weirs. These are located on the east side of the\r\nriver, in the town of Penobscot, a short distance from the southern\r\nend of Whitmore Island. The number of salmon taken in 1896 was 20 per\r\ncent greater than in any previous year and over 93 per cent greater\r\nthan the average for the preceding 22 years. Similar comparative\r\nstatements for other nets are at hand, showing the increase in 1896\r\nover previous seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE.

This is chiefly owing (1) to the character of the\r\nbottom, (2) to the fact that the fishing is a riparian privilege\r\nenjoyed only by those who own land fronting on the water,\r\n(3) to the circumstance that the fishing is almost entirely of a\r\nsemi-professional character, and has been taken up by generation after\r\ngeneration as a part of the regular duties connected with the small\r\nfarms, and (4) to the small number of food-fishes occurring in the\r\nriver, and the preponderating importance of two of them--the salmon\r\nand the alewife--for which the nets are exclusively set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalmon Net Types\r\n\r\n\r\n   Salmon weir, Penobscot.

In\r\nmost parts of the region this trap is used in the same form that it\r\nhad in the primitive days of the fishery, but in some sections the\r\nweir has undergone evolution into a combination brush and twine trap,\r\nand in places into a trap made wholly of netting.\r\n\r\nSome of the types of salmon nets used in this region are illustrated\r\nand described by the accompanying figures. In addition to these, which\r\nare wholly or partly of brush, a common apparatus is the floating\r\ntrap, constructed entirely of twine, such as is now generally employed\r\nin the New England States. This is the only salmon net in use at\r\nIslesboro and in some other sections. The local and individual\r\nvariations in the form of the nets depend on the topography of the\r\nbottom and shore and the habits of the salmon, and are the result of\r\nlong experience.\r\n\r\nThe fishing begins as soon as the ice moves out in spring and\r\ncontinues until some time in July. Fish are rarely taken before\r\nthe last two weeks in April. May and June are the best months. In\r\nthat part of the river adjacent to Bangor there is a small fishery\r\nprosecuted with set gill nets. The nets are from 100 to 200 feet long\r\nand have a 6-inch mesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Salmon weir, Castine.

It is in the route\r\nof salmon coming in from the sea to ascend the river, and nets set in\r\nfavorable positions would naturally be expected to intercept the fish.\r\nOn the western side of the island Messrs. R. Crie & Sons have operated\r\na trap for mackerel and herring for four years, and during that time\r\nhave incidentally taken a number of salmon. Between May 20 and July 10\r\nmarketable fish are caught, while in August and September salmon too\r\nsmall to utilize are taken in considerable quantities; in the opinion\r\nof the Messrs. Crie these small fish were on their way to sea from the\r\nPenobscot River. It has been observed that when an easterly wind is\r\nblowing very few salmon are taken, but during a westerly wind salmon\r\nare always obtained in the months named, and the quantity of salmon\r\nsecured in any given year bears a close relation to the direction of\r\nthe prevailing winds. In 1895 the number of marketable salmon caught\r\nwas 65; in 1896 the catch was 167. The largest fish taken in the two\r\nyears weighed 30 pounds, the smallest 1/2 pound. The largest daily\r\ncatch was 31 salmon, in 1896; the next largest, 27, in 1894.\r\n\r\nMr. W. B. Young, of Matinicus Island, has a herring weir on the\r\nsouthwestern part of Ragged Island, which lies a short distance south\r\nof Matinicus Island. In 1896 this weir during June and July caught 15\r\nsalmon with an aggregate weight of 200 pounds. The largest weighed\r\n24 1/2 pounds. No small, unmarketable ones were obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalmon at the Cranberry Isles.\r\n\r\nThe Cranberry Isles lie  a few miles south of Mount Desert Island\r\nand about 25 miles east of Penobscot Bay. They are in the track of\r\nmigrating salmon, as a few herring weirs set around the islands have\r\nfor several years taken one or more salmon almost annually. [3] Mr. W.\r\nI. Mayo, a correspondent at the islands, reports that in June, 1895,\r\nColonel Hadlock took a 17-pound salmon in a weir, and on May 5 of the\r\nsame year Mr. Mayo caught one weighing 19 pounds. None had been taken,\r\nhowever, in 1896 up to September 1.\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 3: See paper entitled \"Notes on the capture\r\n   of Atlantic salmon at sea and in the coast waters of\r\n   the Eastern States,\" Bull. U.S.F.C. 1894.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalmon caught with hook off Maine coast.\r\n\r\nInstances are multiplying of the taking of salmon at sea on trawl lines\r\non the New England coast. The salmon are usually taken during the time\r\nwhen the fish are running in the rivers, but occasionally one has been\r\ncaught in midwinter. The following data relate to fish that probably\r\nbelonged to the Penobscot school.\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 1896 a Gloucester fishing vessel brought into Rockland a\r\n10-pound salmon that had been caught on a cod trawl 20 miles southeast\r\nof Matinicus. The fish was sent home to Gloucester by the captain of\r\nthe vessel, through Mr. Charles E. Weeks, a Rockland fish-dealer.\r\n\r\nSeveral salmon have been taken on hooks off Frenchman Bay within a few\r\nyears. One 25-pound fish was caught on a cod trawl 3 miles off\r\nGouldsboro, in 20 fathoms of water, and another was taken southeast of\r\nMount Desert Island in 35 fathoms.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, on May 22, one of the crew of the schooner _Telephone_,\r\nof Orland, Me., while fishing for cod on German Bank, caught a 10-pound\r\nsalmon. German Bank lies about 50 miles southeast of Mount Desert\r\nIsland and has 65 to 100 fathoms of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDestruction of salmon by seals.\r\n\r\nSeals are known to kill a great many salmon in Penobscot Bay and\r\nthe lower river. They enter and leave the weirs and traps without\r\ndifficulty and cause great annoyance to the fishermen. When a seal\r\nenters a net, the fish are frightened and usually become meshed; the\r\nseal may then devour them at its leisure. The initial bite usually\r\nincludes the salmon's head.\r\n\r\nFishermen in some places report a noticeable increase in seals in the\r\npast few years, and a consequent increase in damage done to the salmon\r\nfishery. The State pays a bounty of $1 each for seal scalps, which\r\nserves to keep the seals somewhat in check, although the sagacity of\r\nthe animals makes it difficult to approach them with a rifle and to\r\nsecure them when shot. Within a few years some weir fishermen have been\r\nobliged at times to patrol the waters in the vicinity of their nets, in\r\norder to prevent depredations. In the Cape Rosier region, where some\r\nsalmon trap fishing is done, seals were very troublesome in the early\r\npart of the season of 1896. Mr. George Ames, who set three traps in\r\n1896 and took about 100 salmon, had knowledge of 13 other salmon that\r\nwere destroyed by seals while in his nets. Similar instances of\r\nrelatively large numbers of salmon killed by seals might be given. With\r\nsalmon worth 20 to 50 cents a pound the loss of 10 or 12 salmon by\r\nseals, in a total catch of 75 or 100, is a matter of importance to the\r\nfisherman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidences of results of propagation.\r\n\r\nThe opinion is now practically unanimous among the salmon fishermen of\r\nPenobscot River and Bay that the artificial hatching of salmon by the\r\nU.S. Fish Commission is producing beneficial results. About the same\r\narguments in support of their opinions are presented by all, and these\r\naccord well in the main with the observations of other persons who have\r\ngiven this matter attention:\r\n\r\n(1) The opportunities for natural reproduction are exceedingly limited,\r\nowing to the obstructions to the passage of the fish to their spawning\r\ngrounds in the headwaters of the Penobscot basin.\r\n\r\n(2) The salmon that are naturally hatched are, even under the most\r\nfavorable conditions prevailing at the present time, not numerous\r\nenough to keep up the supply of market and brood fish, with the\r\nfatalities incident to the long residence at sea and to the passage of\r\nimmature fish down from the spawning grounds to the sea.\r\n\r\n(3) The remarkable run in May and June, 1896, of fish of comparatively\r\nsmall size that had apparently just reached maturity and the relative\r\nscarcity of large fish that had evidently been in the river during one\r\nor two previous seasons seemed to show a tendency toward the depletion\r\nof the run of old fish and the substitution of a run of young,\r\nartificially hatched fish.\r\n\r\n(4) A feature of the salmon supply in recent years, on which the\r\nfishermen nearly all lay considerable stress, is that the runs in\r\nApril and July, which in former years were often quite important and\r\nremunerative, have of late been very poor, although the fish\r\nconstituting them are of large size, while the runs in May and June\r\nhave kept up, but have consisted chiefly of comparatively small fish.\r\nIn this the fishermen believe they see evidence of the work of the\r\nhatchery, for the young salmon artificially hatched have been from eggs\r\nof May and June fish, and the fishermen think that such young fish,\r\nwhen they return to the river to spawn, will come at about the same\r\ntime that their parents did.\r\n\r\nMany salmon fishermen might be quoted on the question of results of\r\npropagation. A few sample statements and records of salmon taken will\r\nbe given covering different parts of the bay and river.\r\n\r\nMr. Francis French, an experienced salmon fisherman of Stockton, on the\r\nwestern side of Penobscot Bay, reports that of the 61 salmon taken in\r\nhis weir in 1896, 56 were under 11 pounds in weight, and all evidently\r\nbelonged to the same year's brood. In 1895 the 29 salmon obtained by\r\nMr. French averaged 20 pounds each. According to his observations, a\r\nvery large percentage of the salmon in the Penobscot region in 1896\r\nwere hatchery fish that then entered the river for the first time.\r\n\r\nMr. A. H. Whitmore, a salmon fisherman of over thirty years'\r\nexperience, who fishes three weirs off the southern end of Whitmore\r\nIsland, states that in that part of the river the catch in 1896 was the\r\nlargest in thirty years, with the exception of one season. He thinks\r\nthere is no doubt whatever of the beneficial results of artificial\r\npropagation, as shown by the maintenance of the supply when\r\nobstructions to the passage of salmon to the upper waters must greatly\r\ncurtail natural spawning.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Hurd, of Winterport, has two weirs at Oak Point, which is\r\nthe upper limit of weir fishing for salmon on the west side of the\r\nriver; the nets are about 12 miles below Bangor; 25 salmon were taken\r\nin 1895, and 60 in the following year. The catch was better in 1896\r\nthan in a number of years. Eight years before, Mr. Hurd took 140\r\nsalmon, which was the best season in his experience; since then the\r\nfish have been decreasing until 1896. He thinks very few fish get to\r\ntheir spawning-grounds, owing to dams and other obstructions in the\r\nriver above Bangor, and has no doubt the small fish which were so\r\nconspicuous in 1896 were from the Government hatchery.\r\n\r\nMr. William F. Abbott, of Verona, who has two weirs on Whitmore Island,\r\ncaught 41 salmon in 1895, and 80 in 1896. He makes the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion, there would not enough salmon come into the river to\r\npay for building weirs if there had been no salmon artificially hatched;\r\nand I hope the Government will continue to keep the salmon fishing up,\r\nso it will pay to build our weirs. No person that knows anything about\r\nit can doubt that it is a good thing for the fishermen.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey Heath, of Verona, has two weirs on the eastern side of the\r\nsouthern end of Whitmore Island. He caught 62 salmon in 1895, and 100\r\nin 1896. He thinks that the removal of obstructions to the passage of\r\nfish to their spawning-grounds would be all that is necessary to secure\r\na good run of fish in the river, but believes that under present\r\nconditions the salmon-cultural work of the Government is very useful in\r\nsustaining the fishery.\r\n\r\nThree weirs of Mr. E. A. Bowden, located on the eastern side of\r\nWhitmore Island, above those of Mr. Heath, took, 31 salmon in 1895, and\r\n85 in 1896. Mr. Bowden says:\r\n\r\n\"I think that if it was not for the hatchery we would not have any\r\nsalmon to speak of, for all the school we have is in June.  April, May,\r\nand July salmon are very scarce.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Charles G. Atkins, superintendent of the government salmon hatchery\r\nin Orland, Me., informs the writer that he has been inclined to believe\r\nthat each year a great many salmon succeed in reaching their spawning\r\ngrounds; but recent observations have caused him to change his mind,\r\nand he is now of the opinion that only relatively few salmon elude the\r\ntraps, weirs, and gill nets, surmount the dams and fishways, escape the\r\npoachers, and succeed in depositing their eggs under conditions\r\nfavorable to their development. The dam at Bangor, while certainly a\r\nformidable obstruction to the passage of fish, is probably passable at\r\nhigh water. It is provided with a fishway, and some fish are known to\r\nsurmount the dam by this means. Above Bangor, in the main river, there\r\nare dams at Great Works and Montague, the dam at Montague being an\r\nespecially serious obstruction, although it is provided with a good\r\nfishway. Below the dam at Bangor there is little poaching, but below\r\nthe other dams--especially at Montague--comparatively large numbers of\r\nsalmon are sacrificed by the illegal use of the spear and drift net. In\r\n1896 all the salmon below Montague were at the mercy of poachers after\r\nJuly 15, when all wardens on the river were laid off. The supply of\r\nspawning fish was thus greatly reduced. The people above Bangor have no\r\ninterest in preserving the salmon supply of the river, as they receive\r\nnone of the benefits from fishing which are enjoyed by fishermen of the\r\nlower river.\r\n\r\nThis year Mr. Atkins, having this matter under consideration, visited\r\nthe east branch of the Penobscot River. A certain tributary of the east\r\nbranch, which was said to be one of the best spawning-grounds for\r\nsalmon in the Penobscot basin, was obstructed by a dam in the spawning\r\nregion. The dam was impassable to fish in July, and had been so during\r\nthe previous months. In a deep pool below the dam, which was reported\r\nto be a favorite resort for salmon each season, no salmon were found.\r\nIn other words, if the salmon had reached this stream they could not\r\nhave gotten above the dam, and would undoubtedly have congregated in\r\nthe pool mentioned and been noticed, but no fish had ascended even that\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtension of salmon-hatching operations on the Penobscot.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of branch hatcheries has been suggested in order to\r\nutilize the spawning salmon in the region which lies above commercial\r\nfishing, and thus increase by artificial means the production of young\r\nfish.  It is well known that even under the best conditions now\r\nprevailing in our streams the eggs of anadromous fishes like the salmon\r\nand shad are liable to numerous destructive agencies; that only a small\r\npercentage of the eggs laid under natural surroundings ever hatch, and\r\nthat the young are subject to heavy mortality up to the time when they\r\nleave the river and enter the salt water. Probably 5 per cent would\r\nbe much too large an estimate of the number of salmon eggs which in a\r\nstate of nature produce fish  that reach the ocean. Fish-culture, on\r\nthe other hand, hatches 95 per cent of the eggs and raises 75 per cent\r\nof the fry to the age of yearlings. Of 206,350 Atlantic salmon eggs\r\nobtained in 1895 at the government station at Craig Brook, 206,109\r\nwere hatched and 151,761 yearling fish were liberated in the fall.\r\nThe percentage of eggs hatched was thus 99.88 and the percentage of\r\nyearlings raised was 78.39. This is sufficient ground for interfering\r\nwith the salmon even after they have reached their spawning-beds, and\r\njustifies the establishment of hatcheries in the headwaters of the\r\nPenobscot, provided the supply of fish in any section is large enough\r\nto insure a reasonable take of eggs.\r\n\r\nNo examinations of the upper tributaries of the Penobscot thus far made\r\nhave disclosed the existence of any stream on which the construction of\r\na branch salmon hatchery is warranted, owing to the few salmon\r\nobtainable. The matter deserves further investigation, however, and\r\nwill receive due consideration at an early date. It is thought that a\r\nsatisfactory supply of fish may be secured by constructing a dam or\r\nrack which will intercept fish in the main stream and lead practically\r\nthe entire run into one tributary, where they may be retained.\r\n\r\nThe operation of a branch salmon hatchery in the river above Bangor\r\nwould of course depend on the successful working of the fishways and\r\nthe enforcement by the State of the anti-poaching laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanting of quinnat salmon and steelhead trout in Maine streams.\r\n\r\nThe United States Fish Commission is making the experiment of planting\r\nlarge numbers of non-indigenous salmon in the Penobscot Basin and other\r\nMaine waters with a view to test whether the fishes are adapted to\r\nthose streams. The species with which trials have thus far been made\r\nare the quinnat or chinook salmon (_Oncorhynchus tschawytscha_) and\r\nthe steelhead trout (_Salmo gairdneri_). It is intended to plant\r\nsufficiently large numbers of yearling fish to fully test the\r\nfeasibility of the project; and in the event of success two extremely\r\nvaluable species will have been added to the fishery resources of the\r\nMaine streams.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1896 and 1897 over 2,000,000 young quinnat salmon and\r\nsteelheads were deposited by the Commission in the Penobscot River and\r\nadjacent waters, several hundred thousand of which were four to six\r\nmonths old. The planting of additional fry and yearlings is\r\ncontemplated in order to thoroughly demonstrate whether their\r\nintroduction is possible.\r\n\r\nThe quinnat salmon ranges along practically the entire Pacific Coast\r\nof North America north of Mexico, entering all suitable streams. It is\r\nthe most valuable member of the salmon family, and is taken in very\r\nlarge quantities for canning, salting, and fresh consumption. Its\r\nflesh is very rich and of a deep-red color. It is caught in the rivers\r\nwith gill nets, seines, pound nets, traps, weirs, wheels, and other\r\nappliances. In Monterey Bay, California, large numbers are taken with\r\ntrolling hooks baited with small fish, and, although the fish abstains\r\nfrom food after entering the fresh waters, it may often be lured with\r\nartificial or other baits. The chinook salmon begins to enter the\r\nCalifornia rivers in February, the Columbia in March, and the Alaskan\r\nrivers in May and June. The spawning season covers six months,\r\nextending from June to December, although the spawning period in any\r\ngiven basin is more limited, seldom exceeding one or two months. The\r\nhighest accessible positions in the streams are sought by the spawning\r\nfish, which make rounded excavations in gravelly bottoms, in which the\r\neggs are deposited. The vitality of the fish rapidly decreases after\r\nspawning, their bodies become mutilated and diseased, and in a short\r\ntime they die.\r\n\r\nThe steelhead (_Salmo gairdneri_) also known by the names of salmon\r\ntrout, winter salmon, and Gairdner's trout, closely resembles the\r\nAtlantic salmon in size, form, and habits. It is found from southern\r\nCalifornia to Alaska, and enters the coast rivers in large numbers.\r\nIts flesh is light-colored, but is of excellent flavor, being not\r\ninferior to the eastern salmon. It is caught in large quantities with\r\ngill nets and traps, for canning and use in a fresh condition. As\r\na game fish the steelhead enjoys a high reputation in the Pacific\r\nStates. Its principal run in the rivers is during the fall and winter\r\nmonths, when it ascends the streams long distances, spawning in late\r\nwinter or early spring.\r\n\r\nIn order that anglers, fishermen, fish-dealers, and others may be\r\nable to distinguish from the Atlantic salmon and from each other\r\nany specimens of quinnat salmon and steelhead that come to their\r\nnotice, the following key [4] has been prepared to cover the principal\r\ndifferential characters, and illustrations of the three species are\r\nshown:\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 4: The parts referred to in the key may be defined\r\n   as follows: Anal fin, the single fin on the median line of\r\n   the body, between the vent and the tail; gillrakers, bony\r\n   protuberances on the concave side of the bones supporting\r\n   the gills; branchiostegals, small bones supporting the\r\n   lower margin of the  gill cover; pyloric coeca, worm-like\r\n   appendages of the lower end of the stomach; vomer, a bone in\r\n   the front part of the roof of the mouth.]\r\n\r\nI.
