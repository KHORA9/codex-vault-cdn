WYLIE: DEAR SIR: The essays submitted to us by Mr.\r\n     Bliss, according to your announcement, numbered about twenty.\r\n     Several could not be called essays from their brevity, and others\r\n     were exceedingly incomplete. About twelve, however, required and\r\n     were worthy of careful consideration. That of Mr. D. A. Compton, of\r\n     Hawley, Wayne County, Pa., was, in the opinion of your committee,\r\n     decidedly superior to the others as a practical treatise, sure to\r\n     be of use to potato-growers in every part of the country, and well\r\n     worthy the liberal prize offered by yourself.\r\n\r\n                  In behalf of the committee, sincerely yours,\r\n                                            MASON C. WELD, _Chairman_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO CULTURE.\r\n\r\nBY D. A. COMPTON, HAWLEY, PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe design of this little treatise is to present, with minuteness of\r\ndetail, that mode of culture which experience and observation have\r\nproved to be best adapted to the production of the Potato crop.\r\n\r\nIt is written by one who himself holds the plow, and who has, since his\r\nearly youth, been engaged in agriculture in its various branches, to the\r\nexclusion of other pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe statements which appear in the following pages are based upon actual\r\npersonal experience, and are the results of many experiments made to\r\ntest as many theories.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Northern States of our country the potato is the third\r\nof the three staple articles of food. It is held in such universal\r\nesteem as to be regarded as nearly indispensable. This fact is\r\nsufficient to render a thorough knowledge of the best varieties for use,\r\nthe character of soil best adapted to their growth, their cultivation\r\nand after-care, matters of the highest importance to the farmers of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe main object of this essay is so to instruct the novice in\r\npotato-growing that he may be enabled to go to work understandingly and\r\nproduce the potato in its highest perfection, and realize from his\r\nlabors bestowed on the crop the greatest possible profits.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL REQUIRED--ITS PREPARATION.\r\n\r\nThe potato is most profitably grown in a warm, dry, sandy, or gravelly\r\nloam, well filled with decayed vegetable matters. The famous potato\r\nlands of Lake County, Ohio, from which such vast quantities of potatoes\r\nare shipped yearly, are yellow sand. This potato district is confined to\r\nridges running parallel with Lake Erie, which, according to geological\r\nindications, have each at different periods defined its boundaries. This\r\nsand owes much of its potato-growing qualities to the sedimentary\r\ndeposit of the lake and to manural properties furnished by the\r\ndecomposition of the shells of water-snails, shell-fish, etc., that\r\ninhabited the waters.\r\n\r\nNew lands, or lands recently denuded of the forest, if sufficiently dry,\r\nproduce tubers of the most excellent quality. Grown on dry, new land,\r\nthe potato always cooks dry and mealy, and possesses an agreeable flavor\r\nand aroma, not to be attained in older soils. In no argillaceous soil\r\ncan the potato be grown to perfection as regards quality. Large crops\r\non such soil may be obtained in favorable seasons, but the tubers are\r\ninvariably coarse-fleshed and ill-flavored. To produce roots of the best\r\nquality, the ground must be dry, deep, and porous; and it should be\r\nremembered that, to obtain very large crops, it is almost impossible to\r\nget too much humus in the soil. Humus is usually added to arable land\r\neither by plowing under green crops, such as clover, buckwheat, peas,\r\netc., or by drawing and working in muck obtained from swamps and low\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe muck should be drawn to the field in fall or winter, and exposed in\r\nsmall heaps to the action of frost. In the following spring, sufficient\r\nlime should be mixed with it to neutralize the acid, (which is found in\r\nnearly all muck,) and the whole be spread evenly and worked into the\r\nsurface with harrow or cultivator.\r\n\r\nLeaves from the woods, buckwheat straw, bean, pea, and hop vines, etc.,\r\nplowed under long enough before planting to allow them time to rot, are\r\nvery beneficial. Sea-weed, when bountifully applied, and turned under\r\nearly in the fall, has no superior as a manure for the potato. No stable\r\nor barn-yard manure should be applied to this crop. If such nitrogenous\r\nmanure must be used on the soil, it is better to apply it to some other\r\ncrop, to be followed the succeeding year by potatoes. The use of stable\r\nmanure predisposes the tubers to rot; detracts very much from the\r\ndesired flavor; besides, generally not more than one half as many\r\nbushels can be grown per acre as can be obtained by using manures of a\r\ndifferent nature. Market gardeners, many of whom from necessity plant on\r\nthe same ground year after year, often use fine old stable manure with\r\nprofit. Usually they plant only the earlier varieties, crowd them with\r\nall possible speed, dig early, and sell large and little before they\r\nhave time to rot, thus clearing the ground for later-growing vegetables.\r\nThus grown, potatoes are of inferior quality, and the yield is not\r\nalways satisfactory. Flavor, however, is seldom thought of by the hungry\r\ndenizens of our cities, in their eagerness to get a taste of something\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\nMarket gardeners will find great benefit from the use of wood-ashes,\r\nlime, and the phosphates. Sprinkle superphosphate in the hill at the\r\nrate of two hundred pounds per acre; mix it slightly in the soil with an\r\niron rake or potato-hook, then plant the seed. Just before the last\r\nhoeing, sprinkle on and around the hill a large handful of wood-ashes,\r\nor an equal quantity of lime slacked in brine as strong as salt will\r\nmake it.\r\n\r\nBut for the generality of farmers, those who grow only their own supply,\r\nor those who produce largely for market, no other method of preparing\r\nthe soil is so good, so easy, and so cheap as the following; it requires\r\ntime, but pays a big interest: Seed down the ground to clover with wheat\r\nor oats. As soon as the grain is off, sow one hundred and fifty pounds\r\nof plaster (gypsum) per acre, and keep off all stock. The next spring,\r\nwhen the clover has made a growth of two inches, sow the same quantity\r\nof plaster again. About the tenth of July, harrow down the clover,\r\ndriving the same direction and on the same sized lands you wish to plow;\r\nthen plow the clover neatly under about seven inches deep. Harrow down\r\nthe same way it was plowed, and immediately sow and harrow in two\r\nbushels of buckwheat per acre. When it has grown two inches, sow plaster\r\nas before; and when the buckwheat has grown as large as it will, harrow\r\ndown and plow under about five inches deep. This, when cross-plowed in\r\nthe spring sufficiently deep to bring up the clover-sod, is potato\r\nground _first-class in all respects_.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly supposable that this mode of preparation of soil would meet\r\nwith favor among all farmers. There is a parsimonious class of\r\ncultivators who would consider it a downright loss of time, seed, and\r\nlabor; but any one who will take the trouble to investigate, will find\r\nthat these same parsimonious men never produced four hundred bushels of\r\npotatoes per acre; and that the few bushels of small tubers that they do\r\ndig from an acre, are produced at considerable loss. \"Men do not gather\r\ngrapes from thorns, nor figs from thistles.\"\r\n\r\nTo make potato-growing profitable in these times of high prices of land\r\nand labor, it is absolutely necessary that the soil be in every way\r\nfitted to meet any and all demands of the crop.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in the State of Maine, previous to the appearance of the\r\npotato disease, and before the soil had become exhausted by continued\r\ncropping, potatoes yielded an average of four hundred bushels per acre.\r\nNow, every observer is aware that the present average yield of the same\r\nvegetable is much less than half what it was formerly. This great\r\ndeterioration in yield can not be attributed to \"running out\" of\r\nvarieties; for varieties are extant which have not yet passed their\r\nprime. It can not be wholly due to disease; for disease does not occur\r\nin every season and in every place. True, we have more insects than\r\nformerly, but they can not be responsible for all the great falling off.\r\nIt is traceable mainly to poverty of the soil in certain ingredients\r\nimperatively needed by the crop for its best development, and to the\r\npernicious effect of enriching with nitrogenous manures. Any one who\r\nwill plant on suitably dry soil, enriched only with forest-leaves,\r\nsea-weeds, or by plowing under green crops until the whole soil to a\r\nproper depth is completely filled with vegetable matter, will find to\r\nhis satisfaction that the potato can yet be grown in all its pristine\r\nvigor and productiveness.\r\n\r\nTo realize from potato-growing the greatest possible profits, (and\r\nprofits are what we are all after,) the following conditions must be\r\nstrictly adhered to: First, the ground chosen _must be dry_, either\r\nnaturally or made so by thorough drainage; a gently sloping, deep, sandy\r\nor gravelly loam is preferable. Second, the land should be liberally\r\nenriched with humus by some of the means mentioned, if it is not already\r\npresent in the soil in sufficient quantities, and the soil should be\r\ndeeply and thoroughly plowed, rendering it light, porous, and\r\npulverulent, that the air and moisture may easily penetrate to any\r\ndesirable depth of it; and a proper quantity of either wood-ashes or\r\nlime, or both, mixed with common salt, should be harrowed into the\r\nsurface before planting, or be applied on top of the hills immediately\r\nafter planting. And, finally, the cultivation and after-care should be\r\n_prompt_, and given as soon as needed. Nothing is more conducive to\r\nfailure, after the crop is properly planted, than failure in promptness\r\nin the cultivation and care required.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS ON MANURING WITH GREEN CROPS.\r\n\r\nExperience proves that no better method can be adopted to bring up lands\r\npartially exhausted, which are remote from cities, than plowing under\r\ngreen crops. By this plan the farmer can take lot after lot, and soon\r\nbring all up to a high state of fertility. True, he gathers no crop for\r\none year, but the outlay is little; and if in the second year he gathers\r\nas much from one acre as he formerly did from three, he is still\r\nlargely the gainer.\r\n\r\nIt costs no more to cultivate an acre of rich, productive land than an\r\nacre of poor, unproductive land; and the pleasure and profit of\r\nharvesting a crop that abundantly rewards the husbandman for his care\r\nand labor are so overwhelmingly in favor of rich land as to need no\r\ncomment. Besides, manuring with green crops is not transitory in its\r\neffects; the land remembers the generous treatment for many years, and\r\nif at times lime or ashes be added to assist decomposition, will\r\ncontinue to yield remunerative crops long after land but once treated\r\nwith stable manure or guano fails to produce any thing but weeds. The\r\nskinning process, the taking off of every thing grown on the soil and\r\nreturning nothing to it, is ruinous alike to farm and farmer. Thousands\r\nof acres can be found in various parts of the country too poor to pay\r\nfor cultivating without manuring. Of the capabilities of their lands\r\nunder proper treatment the owners thereof have no idea whatever. Such\r\nmen say they can not make enough manure on the farm and are too poor to\r\nbuy. Why not, then, commence plowing under green crops, the only manure\r\nwithin easy reach? If fifty acres can not be turned under the first\r\nyear, put at least one acre under, which will help feed the rest. Why be\r\ncontented with thirty bushels of corn per acre, when eighty or one\r\nhundred may be had? Why raise eight or twelve bushels of wheat per acre,\r\nwhen forty may as well be had? Why cut but one half-ton of hay per acre,\r\nwhen the laws of nature allow at least three? Why spend precious time\r\ndigging only one hundred bushels of potatoes per acre, when with proper\r\ncare and culture three or four hundred may easily be obtained? And,\r\nfinally, why toil and sweat, and have the poor dumb beasts toil and\r\nsweat, cultivating thirty acres for the amount of produce that should\r\ngrow, may grow, can grow, and has grown on ten acres?\r\n\r\nThe poorest, most forsaken side-hills, cobble-hills, and knolls, if the\r\nsand or gravel be of moderate depth, underlaid by a subsoil rather\r\nretentive, by turning under green crops grow potatoes of the first\r\nquality. If land be so poor that clover will not take, as is sometimes\r\nthe case, seed to clover with millet very early in the spring, and\r\nharrow in with the millet thirty bushels of wood-ashes, or two hundred\r\npounds of guano per acre; then sow the clover-seed one peck per acre;\r\nbrush it in.\r\n\r\nIf neither ashes nor guano can be obtained at a reasonable price, sow\r\ntwo hundred pounds of gypsum per acre as soon as the bushing is\r\ncompleted. This will not fail in giving the clover a fair foothold on\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nBefore the millet blossoms, cut and cure it for hay. Keep all stock off\r\nthe clover, plaster it the following spring, plow it under when in full\r\nbloom; sow buckwheat immediately; when up, sow plaster; when in full\r\nbloom, plow under and sow the ground immediately with rye, to be plowed\r\nunder the next May. Thus three crops are put under within a year, the\r\nground is left strong, light, porous, free from weeds, ready to grow a\r\nlarge crop of potatoes, or almost any thing else.\r\n\r\nMuch is gained every way by having and keeping land in a high state of\r\nfertility. Some crops require so long a season for growth, that high\r\ncondition of soil is absolutely necessary to carry them through to\r\nmaturity in time to escape autumnal frosts. In the Western States manure\r\nhas hitherto been considered of but little value. The soil of these\r\nStates was originally very rich in humus. For a time wheat was produced\r\nat the rate of forty bushels per acre; but according to the statistics\r\ngiven by the Agricultural Department at Washington, for the year 1866,\r\nthe average yield in some of these States was but four and a half\r\nbushels per acre. It is evident from this that Mr. Skinflint has had\r\nthings pretty much his own way. His land now produces four and a half\r\nbushels per acre; what time shall elapse when it shall be four and one\r\nhalf acres per bushel? Who dare predict that manure will not at some day\r\nbe of value west of the Alleghanies? New-Jersey, with a soil naturally\r\ninferior to that of Illinois, contains extensive tracts that yearly\r\nyield over one hundred bushels of Indian corn per acre, while the\r\naverage of the State is over forty-three; and the average yield of the\r\nsame cereal in Illinois is but little over thirty-one bushels per acre.\r\nIn the Western States, where potatoes are grown extensively for Southern\r\nmarkets, the average yield is about eighty bushels per acre; while in\r\nold Pennsylvania could be shown the last year potatoes yielding at the\r\nrate of six hundred and forty bushels per acre. There are those who\r\nargue that manure is never necessary--that plant-food is supplied in\r\nabundance by the atmosphere; it was also once said a certain man had\r\ntaught his horse to live without eating; but it so happened that just as\r\nhe got the animal perfectly schooled, it died.\r\n\r\nGood, thorough cultivation and aeration of the soil undoubtedly do much\r\ntoward the production of crops; but mere manipulation is not all that is\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThat growing plants draw much nourishment from the atmosphere, and\r\nappropriate largely of its constituents in building up their tissue, is\r\ncertainly true; it is also certainly true that they require something of\r\nthe soil besides mere anchorage. All facts go to show that if the\r\nconstituents needed by the plant from the soil are not present in the\r\nsoil, the efforts of the plant toward proper development are abortive?\r\nWhat sane farmer expects to move a heavy load over a rugged road with a\r\nteam so lean and poverty-stricken that they cast but a faint shadow? Yet\r\nis he much nearer sanity when he expects farming to be pleasant and\r\nprofitable, and things to _move aright_, unless his land is strong and\r\nfat? Is he perfectly sane when he thinks he can skin his farm year after\r\nyear, and not finally come to the bone? The farmer on exhausted land\r\nmust of necessity use manure. Manure of _some_ kind must go under, or he\r\nmust go under; and to the great mass of cultivators no mode of enriching\r\nis so feasible, so cheap, and attended with such satisfactory results,\r\nas that of plowing under green crops.\r\n\r\nThe old plan of leaving an exhausted farm, and going West in search of\r\nrich \"government land,\" must soon be abandoned. Already the head of the\r\ncolumn of land-hunters have \"fetched up\" against the Pacific, and it is\r\ndoubtful whether their anxious gaze will discover any desirable\r\nunoccupied soil over its waters.\r\n\r\nThe writer would not be understood as saying that all farms are\r\nexhausted, or that there is _no_ way of recuperation but by plowing\r\nunder green crops. What he wishes understood is, that where poor, sandy,\r\nor gravelly lands are found, which bring but small returns to the owner,\r\nby subjecting them to the process indicated, such lands bring good crops\r\nof the kind under consideration. And further, that land in the proper\r\ncondition to yield a maximum crop of potatoes, is fitted to grow other\r\ncrops equally well. Neither would the writer be understood as arguing\r\nthat a crop of clover and one of buckwheat should be turned under for\r\neach crop of potatoes; where land is already in high condition, it may\r\nnot be necessary. A second growth of clover plowed under in the fall for\r\nplanting early kinds, and a clean clover sod turned in _flat_ furrows in\r\nthe spring, for the late market varieties, answer very well. To turn\r\nflat furrows, take the furrow-slice wide enough to have it fall\r\ncompletely inside the preceding one.\r\n\r\nPotatoes should not be planted year after year on the same ground;\r\ntrouble with weeds and rapid deterioration of quality and quantity of\r\ntubers soon render the crop unprofitable. Loamy soil planted\r\ncontinuously soon becomes compact, heavy, and lifeless. Where of\r\nnecessity potatoes must be grown yearly on the same soil, it is\r\nadvisable to dig rather early, and bury the vines of each hill in the\r\none last dug; then harrow level, and sow rye to be plowed under next\r\nplanting time.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent farmer, who grows large crops for market, will always so\r\narrange as to have a clover-sod on dry land in high condition each year\r\nfor potatoes. It is said by many, in regard to swine, that \"the breed is\r\nin the trough;\" though this is certainly untrue to a certain extent, yet\r\nit is undeniable that in potato-growing success or failure is in the\r\ncharacter of soil chosen for their production.\r\n\r\nWhy clover, or clover and buckwheat lands, are so strongly urged is,\r\nsuch lands have in them just what the tubers need for their best and\r\nhealthiest development; the soil is rendered so rich, light, and porous,\r\nand so free from weeds, that the cultivation of such land is rather a\r\npleasure than otherwise, and at the close of the season the tangible\r\nprofits in dollars and cents are highly gratifying.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the United States produce about 109,000,000 bushels\r\nof potatoes annually, it might be supposed a great many varieties would\r\nbe cultivated. Such, however, is not the fact. Of the varieties extant,\r\ncomparatively few are grown extensively.\r\n\r\nEvery grower's observation has established the fact that for quality the\r\nearly varieties are inferior to the late ones. The Early June is very\r\nearly, but its quality is quite indifferent. The Cherry Blow is early,\r\nattains good size, and yields rather well. In quality it is poor. The\r\nEarly Kidney, as to quality, is good, but will not yield enough to pay\r\nfor cultivation. The Cowhorn, said to be the Mexican yam, is quite\r\nearly, of first quality, but yields very poorly. The Michigan White\r\nSprout is early, rather productive, and good. Jackson White is in\r\nquality quite good, is early, and a favorite in some places. The Monitor\r\nis rather early, yields large crops; but as its quality is below par, it\r\nbrings a low price in market. Philbrick's Early White is one of the\r\nwhitest-skinned and whitest-fleshed potatoes known. It is about as early\r\nas Early Goodrich, is quite productive, and grows to a large size, with\r\nbut few small ones to the hill. Its quality is excellent. It has not yet\r\nbeen extensively tested. The Early Rose is said to be very early, of\r\nexcellent quality, and to yield extremely well. It has, however, not\r\nbeen very widely tested. Perhaps for earliness and satisfactory product,\r\nthe Early Goodrich has no superior. It is of fair quality, and though\r\nsome seasons it does not yield as well as others, yet, all things\r\nconsidered, it is a desirable variety. The old Neshannock, or Mercer, is\r\namong the latest of the early varieties. As to quality, it is the\r\nstandard of excellence of the whole potato family. But it yields rather\r\npoorly, and its liability to rot, except on soils especially fitted for\r\nit, has so discouraged growers that its cultivation in many sections is\r\nabandoned. On rather poor, sandy soil, manured in the hill with\r\nwood-ashes, common salt, and plaster only, it will produce in ordinary\r\nseasons two hundred bushels per acre of sound, merchantable tubers, that\r\nwill always command the highest market price. Any potato cultivated for\r\na long series of years will gradually become finer in texture and better\r\nin quality; but its liability to disease will also be greatly increased.\r\nAs an instance of this, it will be remembered that when the Merino and\r\nCalifornia varieties were first introduced, they were so coarse as to be\r\nthought fit only to feed hogs, and for this purpose, on account of their\r\ngreat yielding qualities, farmers continued to cultivate them, until\r\nfinally they became so changed as in many sections to be preferred for\r\nthe table. Their cultivation, however, is now nearly abandoned.\r\n\r\nOf the later varieties, the Garnet Chili, a widely-diffused and\r\nwell-known sort, deserves notice. It is not of so good quality as the\r\nPeach Blow; but its freedom from disease, and the large crop it\r\nproduces, make it a favorite with many growers. The chief fault with it\r\nis, the largest specimens are apt to be hollow at the centre. It ripens\r\nrather early; and, even when dug long before maturity, it has a dryness\r\nand mealiness, when prepared for the table, not found in many other\r\nsorts. The Buckeye is extensively grown for market; its yield is not\r\nsatisfactory, and its quality is only medium. The Dykeman is yet grown\r\nto some extent, but will soon be superseded.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Albert is a well-known and highly-esteemed variety,\r\napproaching very near the Peach Blow in quality. One peculiarity of\r\nthis potato is, the largest tubers appear to be of as good quality as\r\nthe small ones. With proper soil and culture, it yields a fair crop; is\r\nquite free from disease; and its smoothness, high flavor, and fine\r\nappearance make it much sought after in the market.\r\n\r\nThe Fluke, a very late potato, is a great favorite with many who produce\r\nfor market. Its yield is very large; and its smoothness and uniformity\r\nof size make it altogether a desirable variety. It is generally free\r\nfrom disease. In quality it is rather above medium.\r\n\r\nThe Harrison, if it should do as well in the future as it has done in\r\nthe past, bids fair to become _the_ potato for general cultivation. It\r\nhas yielded in this section, on soil of moderate fertility, with\r\nordinary culture, one peck to the hill of uniform-sized, merchantable\r\npotatoes. It is a strong, vigorous grower, and very healthy. Its\r\nquality, though not the very best, is good. The Willard, lately\r\noriginated by C. W. Gleason, of Massachusetts, is a half-early variety.\r\nIt is enormously productive, of a rich rose color, spotted and splashed\r\nwith white. The flesh is white. In form and size it closely resembles\r\nthe Early Goodrich, its parent. It has not been extensively tested, but\r\ncertainly promises well. The Excelsior is said, by those interested in\r\nits sale, to be very productive, and of most excellent quality,\r\nretaining its superior flavor all the year round. It is claimed that old\r\npotatoes of this variety are better than new ones of most early kinds,\r\nthus obviating the necessity of having early sorts. The Excelsior is\r\nsaid to cook very white and mealy; form nearly round, eyes prominent. It\r\nhas not been much tested out of the neighborhood where it originated.\r\n\r\nBut the potato-eater is yet unborn who can justly find fault with a\r\nproperly-grown Peach Blow. It is pronounced by many equal or superior to\r\nthe Mercer in quality, which is not the fact. It is emphatically a late\r\npotato; and, though it does not yield as well per acre as some other\r\nsorts, it is comparatively healthy; and its quality is such that it\r\nalways brings a high price in the market. In fact, but few other kinds\r\nof late sorts could find sale if enough of this kind were offered to\r\nsupply the demand. Planted ever so early, it keeps green through the\r\nheat of summer, and never matures its tubers until after the fall rains,\r\nand then no potato does it more rapidly.\r\n\r\nGrown on rich argillaceous soil, it will be hollow, coarse flesh, and\r\nill-flavored; but planted on such soil as is recommended, it is about\r\nall that could be desired. It is a strong, vigorous grower; and one\r\npeculiarity of it is, that insects will not attack vines of this variety\r\nif other kinds are within reach.\r\n\r\nPlanted on extremely poor ground, it will, perhaps, yield more bushels\r\nof tubers, and those of better quality, than any other variety that\r\ncould be planted on the same soil. Among all the old or new sorts,\r\nperhaps, no potato can be found that deteriorates so little in quality\r\nfrom maturity to maturity again. And, in fine, where only high quality\r\nwith moderate yield are desired, it has few if any superiors.\r\n\r\nMany other varieties might be mentioned; but the list given includes\r\nabout all of much merit. New varieties are constantly arising, clamoring\r\nfor public favor, many of which are wholly unworthy of general\r\ncultivation. One or two varieties, such as are adapted to the grower's\r\nlocality and market, are preferable to a greater number of sorts grown\r\nmerely for variety's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF SOIL ON SEEDLINGS.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of a potato, such as quality, productiveness,\r\nhealthfulness, uniformity of size, etc., depend much on the nature of\r\nthe soil on which it originated. These characteristics, some or all,\r\nimbibed by the minute potato from the ingredients of the soil, at its\r\nfirst growth from the seed of the potato-ball, adhere with great\r\ntenacity to it through all its generations. A seedling may, in size,\r\ncolor, and form resemble its parent; but its constitution and quality\r\nare in a great degree dependent on the nature of the soil, climatic\r\ninfluences, and other accidental causes.\r\n\r\nTrue crosses are generally more vigorous and healthy than others; and it\r\nis probably to accidental crosses we are indebted for many varieties\r\nthat differ so widely from their parents. A cross is most apparent to\r\nthe eye when the parents are of different colors, in which case the\r\noffspring will be striped or marked with the colors of each parent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CROSS VARIETIES.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend fully the principles of this subject, and their\r\napplication to practical operations, it will be necessary to take a\r\ngeneral view of the generative organs of the vegetable kingdom, and the\r\nmanner in which they act in the production of their species. If we\r\nexamine a perfect flower, we shall find that it consists essentially of\r\ntwo sets of organs, one called the pistils, the other the stamens. The\r\npistils are located in the centre of the flower, and the stamens around\r\nthem. The summit of the pistil is called the stigma; and on the top of\r\neach stamen is situated an anther--a small sack, which contains the\r\npollen, a dust-like substance, that fertilizes the ovules or young seeds\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\nThese organs are supposed to perform offices analogous to those of the\r\nanimal kingdom--the stamens representing the male, and the pistils the\r\nfemale organs.\r\n\r\nWhen the anthers, which contain the pollen, arrive at maturity, they\r\nopen and emit a multitude of minute grains of pollen; and these, falling\r\non the pistils of the flower, throw out hair-like tubes, which penetrate\r\nthrough the vascular tissue of the pistil, and ultimately reach the\r\novules, thus fertilizing them, and making them capable, when mature, of\r\nreproducing plants of their own kind.\r\n\r\nThe ovules are the rudimentary seeds, situated in a case at the base of\r\nthe pistils, each consisting of a central portion, called the nucleus,\r\nwhich is surrounded by two coats, the inner called the secundine, the\r\nouter the primine. When the hairlike tube of the pollen-grain passes\r\nthrough the orifice in the coatings of the ovule, and reaches the\r\nnucleus, or embryo sack, it is supposed to emit a spermatic or plantlet\r\ngerm, which passes through the wall of the embryo sack and enters the\r\ngerminal vesicle contained in it. The vesicle corresponds to the\r\nvesicle, or germinal spot, in the eggs of birds, and ovum of mammiferous\r\nanimals. The germ remains in the vesicle, and finally becomes the\r\nembryo, fully developed into a plantlet, as may be seen in many seeds.\r\n\r\nFlowers of plants are called perfect when the stamens and pistils are in\r\nthe same flower, as the apple; mon[oe]cious, when in different flowers\r\nand on the same plant, as the white oak; and di[oe]cious, when in\r\ndifferent flowers and on different plants, as in the hemp. In that class\r\nof plants in which the stamens, or males, are on one plant, and the\r\npistils, or females, on another, the males of course must always remain\r\nbarren; and the pistilates, to be fruitful, must have the pollen from\r\nthe anthers of the staminate brought in contact with its stigma by wind,\r\ninsects, or other means. In plants with perfect flower, the stamens are\r\ngenerally situated around and above the pistil, so that the pollen falls\r\nupon the stigma by mere force of gravity. In the potato, the pollen is\r\nconveyed from the anthers to the stigma by actual contact of the two\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nCross-breeding in plants consists in fertilizing one variety with the\r\npollen of another variety of the same species. The offspring is called a\r\ncross-breed, or variety. The process of cross-breeding consists in\r\ntaking the pollen of one variety and applying it to the stigma of\r\nanother variety, in such a way as to effect its fertilization. This is\r\ndone by cutting away (with scissors) the stamens of the flower to be\r\nfertilized, a short time before they arrive at maturity, and taking a\r\nflower in which the pollen is ripe, dry, and powdery, from the stalk of\r\nthe variety wished for the male parent; and holding it in the right\r\nhand, and then striking it on the finger of the left, held near the\r\nflower, thus scattering the pollen on the stigma of the pistil of the\r\nflower to be fertilized. The utmost care should be taken to apply the\r\npollen when the flower is in its greatest vigor, and the stigma is\r\ncovered with the necessary coating of mucus to insure a perfect\r\nconnection of the pollen with the pistil, and make the fertilization\r\nperfect. All flowers not wanted in the experiment should be removed\r\nbefore any pollen is formed.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to tie a thin piece of gauze over the flower to be\r\nfertilized, before and after crossing, to prevent insects from conveying\r\npollen to it, thus frustrating the labors of the operator. If the\r\noperation has been successful, the pistil will soon begin to wither; if\r\nnot perfect, the pistil will continue fresh and full for some days.\r\nThis _modus operandi_ is substantially the same in crossing fruits,\r\nflowers, and vegetables throughout the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nHybridizing differs from cross-breeding only in fertilizing one species,\r\nor one of its varieties, with the pollen of another species, or one of\r\nits varieties, of the same or a different _genus_. The offspring is\r\ncalled a hybrid, or mule. Hybrids, with very few exceptions, are\r\nsterile, they fail to propagate themselves from seed, and must, to\r\npreserve them, be propagated by grafts, layers, or suckers. No change is\r\nperceptible in the fruit produced from blossoms upon which the operation\r\nof cross-breeding or hybridizing has been performed; but the seed of\r\nfruits so obtained may be planted with the certainty of producing a\r\nfruit or tuber commingling the qualities, colors, and main\r\ncharacteristics of both parents.\r\n\r\nExperience, however, shows that the characteristics of the male\r\npredominate somewhat in the offspring. To judicious cross-breeding and\r\nhybridizing we owe most of our superior fruits and vegetables. If the\r\noperation were more generally known and practiced by farmers, the most\r\ngratifying results would be soon obtained, not only in the production of\r\nthe most valuable varieties of potatoes and other vegetables, but also\r\nin fruits, flowers, and grain of every description.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOOTH VS. ROUGH POTATOES.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, smooth potatoes are preferable to those with\r\ndeeply-sunken eyes. The starch being most abundant near the skin, not so\r\nmuch is lost by the thin paring of the former as by the necessarily\r\ndeeper paring of the latter.\r\n\r\nVarieties usually well formed sometimes grow so knobby and ill-shaped as\r\nto be scarcely recognized. This is caused by severe drought occurring\r\nwhen the tubers are about two thirds grown, causing them to partially\r\nripen. On the return of moisture, a new growth takes place, which shows\r\nitself in knobby protuberances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUT AND UNCUT SEED.\r\n\r\nMany growers argue that potatoes should be planted whole. The only\r\nplausible theory in support of whole seed is, that the few eyes that do\r\nstart have a greater supply of starch available from which to obtain\r\nnutriment until the plant can draw support from the soil and atmosphere.\r\nBut experiments also demonstrate that if all the eyes except one or two\r\nnear the middle be cut out of the seed-potato, such seed will push with\r\nthe greatest possible vigor.\r\n\r\nMany eyes of the uncut seed start, but the stronger soon overpower the\r\nweaker, and finally starve them out. A plot planted with three small,\r\nuncut potatoes to the hill, and another planted with three pieces of two\r\neyes each to the hill, will not show much difference in number of vines\r\nduring the growing season.\r\n\r\nThe poor results sometimes attending cut seed are almost always\r\ntraceable to improper seed improperly cut. Only large, mature, sound\r\ntubers should be used. Cut them in pieces of two or three eyes each,\r\ntaking pains to secure around each eye as much flesh as possible, also\r\nunder the eye to the centre of the tuber.\r\n\r\nExperiments prove that eyes from the \"seed end\" produce potatoes that\r\nmature earliest; they are also smallest. Those from the large or stem\r\nend are largest, latest, and least in numbers. Eyes from the middle\r\nproduce tubers of very uniform size.\r\n\r\nIf small, ill-shaped potatoes be planted on the same ground for three\r\nsuccessive years, the results will give the best variety a bad name.\r\n\r\nMuch is gained by changing seed. No two varieties are made up of the\r\nsame constituents exactly in the same proportion; hence, a soil may be\r\nexhausted for the best development of one, and still be fitted to meet\r\nthe demands of another. Even when the same variety is desired,\r\nexperience shows the great benefit of planting seed grown on a different\r\nsoil. The best and most extensive growers procure new seed every two or\r\nthree years, and many insist on changing seed every year; and\r\nundoubtedly the crop is often doubled by the practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING AND MANURING.\r\n\r\nEarly kinds should be planted as soon as the ground has become\r\nsufficiently dry and warm. Late market varieties should be planted about\r\ntwo weeks later than the early ones. Unquestionably more bushels can be\r\nobtained per acre by planting in drills than in hills, but the labor of\r\ncultivating in drills is much the greater.\r\n\r\nPrepare the ground by thorough plowing, making it decidedly mellow. Mark\r\nit out four feet apart each way, if to be planted in hills, by plowing\r\nbroad, flat-bottomed furrows about three inches deep. At the crossings\r\ndrop three pieces of potato, cut, as directed, in sections of two or\r\nthree eyes each. Place the pieces so as to represent the points of a\r\ntriangle, each piece being about a foot distant from each of the other\r\ntwo. If the cut side is put down, it is better; cover about two inches\r\ndeep. Where land is free from stone and sod, the covering may be well\r\nand rapidly done with a light plow. Immediately after planting, sprinkle\r\nover and around each hill a large handful of unleached wood-ashes and\r\nsalt, (a half-bushel of fine salt mixed with a barrel of ashes is about\r\nthe right proportion.) If ashes can not be obtained, as is sometimes the\r\ncase, apply instead about the same quantity of lime slacked in brine as\r\nstrong as salt will make it. The potato from its peculiar organization\r\nhas a hungering and thirsting after potash. Wood-ashes exactly meet its\r\nwants in this direction. Lime indirectly supplies potash by liberating\r\nwhat was before inert in the soil. Salt in small quantities induces\r\nvigorous, healthy growth. To obtain the best results, the ashes or lime\r\nshould be covered with about half an inch of soil. This plan of manuring\r\nin the hill is recommended only in cases where the fertilizers named are\r\nin limited supply, and it is desirable to make the most of them. Maximum\r\ncrops have been obtained by using the fertilizers named in the manner\r\ndescribed; but where they can be obtained at low prices, it is certainly\r\nadvisable, and requires less labor, to apply all three, ashes, lime, and\r\nsalt, broadcast in bountiful quantities, and harrow it in before the\r\nground is marked out for planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION.\r\n\r\nIf weeds are expected, pass a light harrow over the rows just before the\r\nvines are ready to burst through; this will disturb them and render them\r\nless troublesome. As soon as the tops are two inches high, run a\r\ncorn-plow five inches deep _close_ to the hills, turning the furrows\r\n_from_ the rows.\r\n\r\nPlow both ways twice between the rows, finishing on the rows running\r\neast and west, which will give the sun's rays a better chance to warm\r\nthe ground properly. Standing on the squares of earth, warmed on all\r\nsides by the air and sunlight, the potatoes will grow amazingly. Just as\r\nsoon as the tops have attained a height of six or seven inches, hitch a\r\nstrong horse to a two-horse plow, and turn furrows fully seven inches\r\ndeep midway between the rows _to_ the hills. Plow twice between the\r\nrows both ways; and if the ground be a side-hill, turn the first furrow\r\nbetween the rows up-hill, which will leave the rows in better shape.\r\nHoeing is often wholly unnecessary; but where, from weeds or poor\r\nplowing, it is needed, draw mellow earth to the plants with the hoe,\r\nkeeping the top of the hills somewhat hollow to catch the rains. Then,\r\nso far as stirring the soil is concerned, _let it alone_.\r\n\r\nAfter potatoes are fairly up, their cultivation should be crowded\r\nthrough with all possible speed, or at least as rapidly as the growth of\r\nthe tops will permit.\r\n\r\nIf the last plowing be deferred until the vines are large, a large\r\nproportion of small potatoes is sure to be the consequence. After a\r\ncertain stage of growth, new tubers are formed each time the soil is\r\ndisturbed; these never fully develop, they rob those first formed, and\r\nmake the crop much inferior to what it should be. By the mode of culture\r\ndescribed, the ground is made warm and mellow close up to the\r\nseed-potatoes, the roots soon fill the whole hill, and tubers are formed\r\nthat have nothing to do but to grow. The writer is aware flat culture\r\nhas strong advocates; but, after many experiments, he is convinced that\r\nhills are much the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLASTER.\r\n\r\nHowever much lime or other fertilizers may be applied to the soil, still\r\ngreat benefit is derived from the use of plaster, (sulphate of lime.)\r\n\r\nAfter all, plaster is the main dependence of the potato-grower, a help\r\non which he may rely with the utmost confidence. Astonishing results are\r\nobtained from its use, when applied in a proper manner. The writer has\r\nseen a field, all of the same soil, all prepared alike, and all planted\r\nwith the same variety at the same time, on one half of which, that had\r\nno plaster, the yield was but sixty bushels per acre, and many rotten;\r\nthe other part, to which plaster was applied in the manner hereafter\r\nexplained, yielded three hundred and sixty bushels per acre, and not an\r\nunsound one among them.\r\n\r\nThe action of plaster is often puzzling. From the fact that where land\r\nhas been strongly limed, a small quantity of plaster applied shows such\r\ndecided benefit, there would seem plausibility in Liebig's theory that\r\nits effects must be traceable not to the lime, but to the sulphuric\r\nacid. The ammonia in rain-water in the form of carbonate (a volatile\r\nsalt) is decomposed by plaster, the sulphuric acid having greater\r\naffinity for it, thus forming two new compounds, sulphate of ammonia and\r\ncarbonate of lime. But as arable soil has the same property of absorbing\r\nammonia from the air and rain-water, and fixing it in the same or even a\r\nhigher degree than lime, there is only the sulphuric acid left to look\r\nto for an explanation of the favorable action of plaster on the growth\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\nIt is found that plaster in contact with soil undergoes decomposition,\r\npart of the lime separating from the sulphuric acid, and magnesia and\r\npotash taking its place, quite contrary to the ordinary affinities.\r\n\r\nThese facts show that the action of plaster is very complex, and that it\r\npromotes the distribution of both magnesia and potash in the ground,\r\nexercising a chemical action upon the soil which extends to any depth of\r\nit; and that, in consequence of the chemical and mechanical\r\nmodifications of the earth, particles of certain nutritive elements\r\nbecome accessible and available to plants that were not so before.\r\n\r\nIt is said plaster is of most benefit in wet seasons; such is not\r\nalways the case. It is certainly beneficial to clover, wet or dry; so of\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nA few years since, when the drought was so intense in this section as to\r\nrender the general potato crop almost a total failure, the writer\r\nproduced a plentiful crop by the use of plaster alone. On examination at\r\nthe dryest time, the bottoms of the hills were found to be literally\r\ndust, yet in this dust the tubers were swelling finely: the leaves and\r\nvines were of a deep rich green, and remained so until frost, while\r\nother fields in sight, planted with the same variety, but not treated\r\nwith plaster, were brown, dead, and not worth digging. That gypsum\r\nattracts moisture may be proved by plastering a hill of corn and leaving\r\na hill by it unplastered; the dew will be found deposited in greater\r\nabundance on the plastered hill. But, according to Liebig, certain\r\nproducts of the chemical action of plaster enter into and are\r\nincorporated with the structure of the plant, closing its breathing\r\npores to such an extent that the plant is enabled to withstand a drought\r\nwhich would prove fatal to it unassisted.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that plaster renders plants less palatable to insects,\r\nand, so far as the writer's experiments extend, it is fatal to many of\r\nthe fungi family. To obtain the best results, the vines of potatoes\r\nshould be dusted with plaster as soon as they are fairly through the\r\nsoil, again immediately after the last plowing and hoeing, and, for\r\nreasons hereafter given, at intervals throughout the whole growing\r\nseason. The first application may be light, the second heavier, and\r\nthereafter it should be bountifully applied, say two hundred pounds per\r\nacre at one sowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POTATO-ROT--ITS CAUSE\r\n\r\nThe year 1845 will ever be memorable by its giving birth to a disease\r\nwhich threatened the entire destruction of the potato crop, and which\r\ncaused suffering and pecuniary ruin to an incredible extent throughout\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe potato, at the time of the appearance of the potato disease, was\r\nalmost the sole dependence of the common people of Ireland for food.\r\nThat over-populated country experienced more actual suffering in\r\nconsequence of the potato disease than has any other from the same\r\ncause. Although this disease has never, in this country, prevailed to\r\nthe same ruinous extent that it has in some others, yet we are yearly\r\nreminded of its existence, and in some seasons and localities its\r\ndestructive effects are seriously apparent.\r\n\r\nThe final or culminating cause of the disease known as the \"potato-rot\"\r\nis _Botrytis (peronospora) infestans_. This may be induced by many and\r\nvarious predisposing causes, such as feebleness of constitution of the\r\nvariety planted, rendering them an easy prey to the disease; by planting\r\non low, moist land, or on land highly enriched by nitrogenous manures,\r\ncausing a morbid growth which invites the disease; also by insects or\r\ntheir larvæ puncturing or eating off the leaves or vines. But by far the\r\nmost wide-spread and most common cause of the disease is sudden changes\r\nof atmospheric temperature, particularly when accompanied by rain.\r\nDrought, though quite protracted and severe, unless accompanied by\r\nstrong drying winds, and followed by sudden and great reduction of\r\ntemperature, seldom affects the potato seriously. It is not uncommon in\r\nthe Northern States, during the months of August and September, for\r\nstrong westerly winds to prevail for many days in succession. These\r\nwinds, coming from the great American desert, are almost wholly devoid\r\nof moisture, and their aridity is often such that vegetation withers\r\nbefore them as at the touch of fire. Evaporation is increased in a\r\nprodigiously rapid ratio with the velocity of wind. The effects of the\r\nexcessive exhalation from the leaves of plants exposed to the sweep of\r\nsuch drying winds are at once seriously apparent.\r\n\r\nWhen these winds finally cease, the atmosphere has a low relative\r\nhumidity, not enough moisture remains in the air to prevent radiation;\r\nthe heat absorbed by the earth through the day is, during the bright,\r\ncloudless night, rapidly radiated and lost in space, and a reduction in\r\ntemperature of twenty to thirty degrees is the consequence.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the potato-vines suffer by excessive exhalation; in\r\nthe second, by sudden reduction of temperature, and, though not frozen,\r\ntheir functions are much deranged, and their vitality greatly enfeebled.\r\nTo use a common expression, the plant \"has caught a violent cold that\r\nhas settled on the lungs.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaves (which are the lungs of plants) now fail to perform their\r\nfunctions properly. The points of many of the leaves turn brown, curl\r\nup, and die.\r\n\r\nThe ascending sap, not being fully elaborated by the diseased leaves,\r\noozes out through the skin of the stalk in a thick, viscous state, and\r\nthe plant to all appearance is in a state of consumption.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the ever-present minute spores of the _Botrytis infestans_\r\neagerly pounce on the sickly plant, fastening themselves on its most\r\ndiseased parts. The _Botrytis infestans_ is a cryptogamous plant, and is\r\nincluded in the Mucidineous family, (moulds.) It is a vegetable parasite\r\npreying upon the living potato plant, like lice or other animal\r\nparasites upon the animal species.\r\n\r\nAt first this mould forms webby, creeping filaments, known in botanical\r\nlanguage as mycelium. These root-like fibres then branch out, sending\r\nout straight or decumbent articulated stems. These bead-like joints fill\r\nup successively with seeds or spores, which are discharged at the proper\r\ntime to multiply the species.\r\n\r\nUnder favorable conditions of warmth and moisture, the mycelium spreads\r\nvery rapidly. Spores are soon formed and matured, to be carried to\r\nplants not yet infected. Rains also wash the seminal dust down the\r\nplant, causing it to fasten and grow on the vine near the ground. The\r\nroots of the parasite penetrate and split up the stalk even to the\r\nmedullary canal.\r\n\r\nThese roots exude a poisonous substance, which is carried by the\r\nelaborated descending sap down to the tubers, and as the largest tubers\r\nrequire the largest amount of elaborated sap for their development, they\r\nwill, consequently, receive the greatest quantity of the vitiating\r\nprinciple, and will, on digging, be found a mass of rottenness, when the\r\nsmaller ones are often but slightly affected. The _Botrytis infestans_\r\ncan not gain a lodgment on vines that are truly healthy and vigorous,\r\nhigh authority to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nHealthy varieties, growing in a sheltered situation on dry, new soil, to\r\nwhich no nitrogenous manures have been applied, can not be infected,\r\nthough brushed with other vines covered with the fungus. Different\r\nvarieties, and sometimes different members of the same variety, are not\r\nalways alike affected by the disease, though growing in the same hill.\r\n\r\nAs will be noticed, the potato disease is rather an effect than a cause,\r\nand appears to have been designed to prevent members enfeebled by\r\naccident or otherwise from propagating their species by putting such\r\nmembers out of existence. Ozone, supposed to be a peculiar form of\r\noxygen, is exhaled from every part of the green surface of plants in\r\nhealth, and effectually repels the attacks of mildew; but it is found\r\nthat when the atmosphere is very dry, or, on the other hand, very humid,\r\nplants cease to evolve ozone, and are therefore unprotected. Winds from\r\nthe ocean are strongly ozonic, and it is ascertained that plants growing\r\non soil to which salt has been applied evolve more ozone than others.\r\nHence the benefit derived from the use of salt on potato lands.\r\n\r\nThe \"Black knot,\" another species of fungus that attacks the branches of\r\nthe plum and Morello cherry, operates very similarly to the potato\r\nmildew. The roots of the parasite penetrate and split up the cellular\r\ntissue of the branch on which it fastens, and if the limb be not\r\npromptly amputated, the descending sap carries the deleterious principle\r\nthrough the whole system, and the following year the disease appears in\r\na greatly aggravated form in every part of the whole tree. The remedy in\r\nthis case is prompt amputation of the part diseased on its first\r\nappearance, and a judicious application of salt to the soil.\r\n\r\nCommon salt, to a certain extent, is as beneficial to some plants as to\r\nanimals; and every intelligent farmer knows that if salt be withheld\r\nfrom the bovine _genus_ for any considerable length of time, the general\r\nhealth droops and parasites are sure to abound. The object of nature in\r\nbringing into existence the large family of mildews, each member of\r\nwhich is a perfect plant in its way, and as capable of performing its\r\nfunctions as the oak of the forest, was undoubtedly to prevent\r\npropagation from sickly stock, and by the decomposition of feeble plants\r\nto make room and enrich the soil for the better development of\r\nhealthier plants. But it by no means follows that, because a plant is\r\nattacked by mildew, it must necessarily be left to die, any more than it\r\nfollows that, because an animal is infested with vermin, it should be\r\nlet alone to be eaten up by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDY FOR THE POTATO-ROT.\r\n\r\nIn treating for the potato-rot, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound\r\nof cure;\" for when leaves or vines are once dead, they ever remain so.\r\nAll that can be done for potatoes infested is to stop the mildew from\r\nspreading, by destroying it where it is, and by strengthening \"those\r\nthings which remain.\" The writer was led to the adoption of the remedy\r\nproposed by experiments made upon fruits.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has an apple or pear-orchard must have observed that\r\nmildew of fruit supervenes after some sudden change of temperature,\r\nespecially when accompanied by rain. Spots of mildew invariably form on\r\nthe young fruit immediately after a cold night, when the thermometer has\r\nindicated a change of twenty to twenty-five degrees. This growth of\r\nmildew takes place when the apples are of various sizes, from the\r\nearliest formation to the size of large marbles. These fungous growths\r\nappear as dark-colored spots, which arrest the growth of the apple\r\nimmediately beneath, causing it to become distorted, while the expansion\r\nand contraction bring on diseased action, which results in the cracking\r\nand general scabbiness of the fruit.\r\n\r\nKnowing that dry-rot (_Merulius Lachrymans_, Schum,) another species of\r\nfungus, was remedied by an application of sulphuric acid, I thought it\r\nmight possibly destroy the fruit mildew. An application of plaster,\r\n(gypsum,) which is composed of lime and sulphuric acid, was made with\r\nthe happiest results. It was found that an apple dusted with ground\r\nplaster at its first formation remained free from mildew and came to\r\nmaturity, while apples growing by it, but not so treated, became scabby\r\nand worthless. It was also ascertained that a thorough application of\r\nplaster destroyed the mildew after it had formed, and that such fruit\r\ncame to maturity. On the potato mildew, so far as the writer's\r\nexperience extends, plaster, if applied early, is a perfect prevention,\r\nand if not delayed too long after the disease appears, is a certain\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nThe vines should be watched closely, and on the first appearance of the\r\ndisease plaster should be applied; not merely sowing it broadcast, but\r\ndashing it over and under the vines, bringing it in contact with the\r\nstalks, using a handful to three or four hills. Plaster for this purpose\r\nshould be very dry and powdery, and should be applied when the air is\r\nstill. One application is seldom sufficient; it should be renewed as\r\noften as circumstances require. Examine the vines about three days after\r\na cold night, or about the same length of time after a heavy rain. If\r\nthe leaves begin to curl and wither, apply plaster at once; and, in\r\nshort, whenever the vines show any signs of drooping, be the cause bites\r\nof insects, excessive aridity, or excessive humidity of the atmosphere,\r\nor sudden change of temperature, drooping from any cause whatever\r\nindicates the approach of mildew, which should be promptly met with an\r\napplication of plaster. As before stated, plaster the vines as soon as\r\nthey are up, again after the last plowing and hoeing; after that, one,\r\ntwo, or three times, as circumstances indicate.\r\n\r\nBy this method the vines are kept of a bright lively green, and the\r\ntubers are kept swelling until growth is stopped by frost. Another point\r\ngained is, potatoes so grown are so sound and free from disease as to be\r\neasily kept for spring market without loss by rot.\r\n\r\nWhether the surprising effects of plaster on the potato mildew is\r\nattributable to the sulphuric acid, to the lime, or to its simply being\r\na dust, has not been determined. It is well known that the fruits of a\r\nvineyard or orchard in close proximity to a dusty and much frequented\r\nhighway are remarkably free from mildew, which can only be due to dust\r\nsettling on the trees and fruit. But in the case of plaster, the writer\r\nis inclined to believe its efficacy is mainly due to the sulphuric acid,\r\nprobably assisted by the lime in a state of dust. Be this as it may, it\r\nmatters not. The result is all that can be desired; the remedy is easily\r\napplied, costs but a trifle, and a single season's trial is all that is\r\nneeded to convince the most skeptical grower of its merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIGGING AND STORING\r\n\r\nIs full half the labor of growing and securing a crop of potatoes.\r\nDigging is a long, laborious task. Many small fortunes are sunk yearly\r\nby inventors in experimenting with and constructing \"potato-diggers;\"\r\nbut, so far, no machine has done the work properly except under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances. Stones, vines, and weeds are obstacles not yet\r\nfully overcome. Many tubers are left covered with earth, and so lost;\r\nand besides, some machines so bruise the potatoes in digging as to\r\ninjure their appearance and keeping qualities. Undoubtedly, the day will\r\ncome when the great bulk of potatoes will be dug well and rapidly by\r\nhorse-power; but until that day does come, the potato-hook must be used.\r\n\r\nMuch of the back-ache and general unpleasantness incident to digging is\r\navoided, or greatly mitigated, by having the potatoes large and sound,\r\nturning out a peck to the hill, especially if the digger is the owner\r\nof the crop.\r\n\r\nDigging should be done only when the ground is dry, that the potatoes\r\nmay come out clean and bright. A small plow, to turn a light furrow from\r\neach side of the rows, is some help. Pull up the vines, and lay them\r\ndown so that they will be covered by the dirt dug from the hill.\r\nCommence on one side of the hill; press the hook or hoe down, so that it\r\nwill reach a trifle below the potatoes, and draw the implement firmly\r\ntoward you. Repeat the operation, each time placing the tool a few\r\ninches further in or across the hill, until the whole hill is dug. By\r\nthis method the potatoes will not be bruised; whereas, if the digging be\r\ncommenced in the centre of the hill, many potatoes will be sacrificed\r\nand much injured. Potatoes should be picked up as soon and as fast as\r\ndug; and immediately covered with straw or other material, to protect\r\nthem from the light. A few hours' strong sunshine will ruin the best\r\npotato ever grown. Light changes the natural color to green, and renders\r\nthe potato so bitter and unpalatable as to be wholly unfit to eat.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inconsiderate way in which potatoes are often dug, and the\r\nlight to which they are exposed while being transported to and while in\r\nmarket, the denizens of our cities seldom, if ever, taste this vegetable\r\nin its greatest excellence. If to be stored in the cellar, the potatoes\r\nshould be left in the field, in heaps covered with straw, until the\r\nsweating is over, and then be removed to the cellar and lightly covered\r\nwith dry sand, or earth, just sufficient to exclude the light.\r\n\r\nIf to be buried in the field, choose a dry, sideling place; scrape out a\r\nslight hollow, by merely removing the surface soil with a hoe; into\r\nthis, pile ten to twelve bushels; place the potatoes properly, and\r\ncover them carefully with clean straw, six inches deep; cover over the\r\nstraw with four or five inches of earth, except a small opening at the\r\ntop; over this opening place a board or flat stone, elevated a little on\r\none side, to lead off the rain.\r\n\r\nLet them remain so until the sweating is completely over, or so long as\r\nprudence will permit; and when cold weather fairly sets in, add more\r\nearth to keep from freezing, leaving only a wisp of straw protruding\r\nthrough to carry off any foul air that may be generated.\r\n\r\nWhere the winters are intensely cold, it is best to cover but lightly\r\nwith earth, say five or six inches deep; and when freezing is becoming\r\nsevere, spread over the heap buckwheat straw, or coarse manure, to the\r\ndepth of six inches. There is danger in covering very deep at first,\r\nespecially if the autumn should prove warm. If kept too warm, rot is\r\nsure to ensue. Experience shows that any vegetable keeps better buried\r\nin pits that contain not more than ten or twelve bushels each.\r\n\r\nWhere large quantities are to be buried, it is advisable to open a long,\r\nshallow, broad trench, leading up and down a hill, if possible, to\r\nsecure good drainage. Commence, at either end, by placing a desirable\r\nquantity of potatoes as soon as dug; next to these put a little straw;\r\nagainst the straw place about six inches of earth; then more straw and\r\nmore potatoes; and so keep on until the trench is full. A few furrows\r\nplowed on each side assist in covering; and make a drain to lead off the\r\nrains, which is a matter of the first importance. By this method each\r\nlot of potatoes is kept separate; and any section can be opened at any\r\ntime to be taken to market, without endangering the others.\r\n\r\nPotatoes buried properly are usually of better flavor in the spring than\r\nit is possible for potatoes to be which are kept in a common cellar.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me add that, if leaves from the woods be used instead of\r\nstraw, to cover potatoes to be buried, such potatoes will be of better\r\nflavor; and further, if nothing but dry earth comes in contact with\r\nthem, they will be better still. Straw is used for the twofold purpose\r\nof securing an air-chamber to keep out frost, and to prevent the earth\r\nfrom mingling with the tubers on opening the pits.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS INJURIOUS TO THE POTATO.\r\n\r\nThere are ten distinct species of insects preying upon the potato-plant\r\nwithin the limits of the United States. Many of these ten species are\r\nconfined within certain geographical limits. Their habits and history\r\ndiffer very widely. Some attack the potato both in the larva state and\r\nin the perfect or winged state; others in the perfect or winged state\r\nalone; and others again in the larva state alone.\r\n\r\nIn the case of seven of these insects, there is but one single brood\r\nevery year; while of the remaining three there are every year from two\r\nto three broods, each of them generated by females belonging to\r\npreceding broods. Eight of the ten feed externally on the leaves and\r\ntender stems of the potato; while two of them burrow, like a borer,\r\nexclusively in the larger stalks.\r\n\r\nEach of these ten species has its peculiar insect enemies; and a mode of\r\nattack which will prove very successful against some of them will often\r\nturn out to be worthless when employed against the remainder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n~The Stalk-Borer~,[A] (_Gortyna nitela_, Guenee.)--This larva (Fig. 2,)\r\ncommonly burrows in the large stalks of the potato. It occurs also in\r\nthe stalks of the tomato, in those of the dahlia and aster, and other\r\ngarden flowers. It is sometimes found boring through the cob of growing\r\nIndian corn. It is particularly partial to the stem of the common\r\ncocklebur, (_Zanthium sirumarium_;) and if it would only confine itself\r\nto such noxious weeds, it might be considered more of a friend than an\r\nenemy. It is yearly becoming more numerous and more destructive. It is\r\nfound over a great extent of country; and is particularly numerous in\r\nthe valley of the Mississippi north of the Ohio River. The larva of the\r\nstalk-borer moth leaves the stalk in which it burrowed about the latter\r\npart of July, and descends a little below the surface of the earth,\r\nwhere in about three days it changes into the pupa, or chrysalis state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Where no hair-lines are given, the insects are represented\r\nlife-size.]\r\n\r\nThe winged insect (Fig. 1,) which belongs to the same extensive group of\r\nmoths (_Noctua_ family, or owlet moths) to which all the cut-worm moths\r\nappertain, emerges from under ground from the end of August to the\r\nmiddle of September. Hence it is evident that some few, at all events,\r\nof the female moths must live through the winter, in obscure places, to\r\nlay eggs upon the plants they infest the following spring; for\r\notherwise, as there is no young potato, or other plants, for them to lay\r\neggs upon in the autumn, the whole breed would die out in a single year.\r\nThis insect, in sections where it is numerous, does more injury to the\r\npotato crop than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Potato-Stalk Weevil,~ (_Baridius trinotatus_, Say.)--This insect is\r\nmore particularly a southern species, occurring abundantly in the Middle\r\nStates, and in the southern parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana.\r\nIt appears to be totally unknown in New-England.\r\n\r\nThe female of this beetle deposits a single egg in an oblong slit, about\r\none eighth of an inch long, which it has previously formed with its beak\r\nin the stalk of the potato. The larva subsequently hatches out, and\r\nbores into the heart of the stalk, always proceeding downward toward the\r\nroot. When full grown, it is a little more than one fourth of an inch in\r\nlength, and is a soft, whitish, legless grub, with a scaly head. Hence\r\nit can always be readily distinguished from the larva of the\r\nstalk-borer, which has invariably sixteen legs, no matter how small it\r\nmay be. Unlike this last insect, it becomes a pupa in the interior of\r\nthe potato-stalk which it inhabits: and it comes out in the beetle state\r\nabout the last of August or beginning of September.\r\n\r\nThe stalk inhabited by the larva wilts and dies. The perfect beetle,\r\nlike many other snout-beetles, must of course live through the winter,\r\nto reproduce its species the following spring. In Southern Pennsylvania,\r\nsome years, nearly every stalk of extensive fields is infested by this\r\ninsect, causing the premature decay of the vines, and giving them the\r\nappearance of having been scalded. In some districts of Illinois, the\r\npotato crop has, in some seasons, been utterly ruined by this\r\nsnout-beetle, many vines having a dozen larvæ in them. This insect\r\nattacks no plant but the potato.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Potato-Worm~, (_Sphinx 5-maculata_, Haworth.)--This well-known\r\ninsect, the larva of which (Fig. 3,) is usually called the potato-worm,\r\nis more common on the closely allied tomato, the leaves of which it\r\noften clears off very completely in particular spots in a single night.\r\nWhen full-fed, which is usually about the last of August, the\r\npotato-worm burrows under the ground, and shortly afterward transforms\r\ninto the pupa state, (Fig. 5.) The pupa is often dug up in the spring\r\nfrom the ground where tomatoes or potatoes were grown in the preceding\r\nseason, and most persons that meet with it suppose that the singular\r\njug-handled appendage at one end of it is its _tail_. In reality,\r\nhowever, it is the _tongue-case_, and contains the long, pliable tongue\r\nwhich the future moth will employ in lapping the nectar of flowers. The\r\nmoth itself (Fig. 4) was formerly confounded with the tobacco-worm moth,\r\n(_Sphinx Carolina_, Linnæus,) which it very closely resembles, having\r\nthe same series of orange-colored spots on each side of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe gray and black markings, however, of the wings differ perceptibly in\r\nthe two species; and in the tobacco-worm moth there is always a more or\r\nless faint white spat, or a dot, near the centre of the front wing,\r\nwhich is never met with in the other species. The potato-worm often\r\nfeeds on the leaves of the tobacco plant in the Northern States. In the\r\nSouthern States, in Mexico and the West-Indies, the true potato-worm is\r\nunknown, and it is the tobacco-worm that the tobacco-grower has to\r\nfight. The potato-worm, however, is never known to injure the potato\r\ncrop to any serious extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Striped Blister-Beetle~, (_Lytta vittata_, Fabr.) This insect (Fig.\r\n6) is almost exclusively a southern species, occurring in some years\r\nvery abundantly on the potato-vines in Southern Illinois, and also in\r\nMissouri, and according to Dr. Harris, it is occasionally found even in\r\nNew-England. In some specimens the broad outer black stripe on the\r\nwing-cases is divided lengthwise by a slender yellow line, so that,\r\ninstead of _two_, there are _three_ black stripes on each wing-case; and\r\noften in the same field may be noticed all the intermediate grades; thus\r\nproving that the four-striped individuals do not form a distinct\r\nspecies, as was supposed by the European entomologist Fabricius, but are\r\nmere varieties of the same species to which the sixth-striped individual\r\nappertains.\r\n\r\nThe striped blister-beetle lives under ground and feeds upon various\r\nroots during the larva state, and emerges to attack the foliage of the\r\npotato only when it has passed into the perfect or beetle state.\r\n\r\nThis insect, in common with our other blister-beetles, has the same\r\nproperties as the imported Spanish fly, and any of them will raise just\r\nas good a blister as that does, and are equally poisonous when taken\r\ninternally in large doses. Where the striped blister-beetle is numerous,\r\nit is a great pest and very destructive to the potato crop. It eats the\r\nleaves so full of holes that the plant finally dies from loss of sap and\r\nthe want of sufficient leaves to elaborate its juices. In some places\r\nthey are driven off the plants (with bushes) on a pile of hay or straw,\r\nand burned. Some have been successful in ridding their fields of them by\r\nplacing straw or hay between the rows of potatoes, and then setting it\r\non fire. The insects, it is said, by this means are nearly all\r\ndestroyed, and the straw burning very quickly, does not injure the\r\nvines.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Ash-Gray Blister-Beetle~, (_Lytta cinera_, Fabr.)--This species (Fig.\r\n7, male) is the one commonly found in the more northerly parts of the\r\nNorthern States, where it usually takes the place of the striped\r\nblister-beetle before mentioned. It is of a uniform ash-gray color. It\r\nattacks not only the potato-vines but also the honey locusts, and\r\nespecially the Windsor bean. In particular years it has been known, in\r\nconjunction with the rose-bug, (_Macrodactylus subspinosus_, Linn.,) to\r\nswarm upon every apple-tree in some orchards in Illinois, not only\r\neating the foliage, but gnawing into the young apples.\r\n\r\nThis beetle does considerable damage to the potato crop, especially in\r\nthe North-Western States. Like the other members of the (_Lytta_)\r\nfamily, it lives under ground while in the larva state, and is\r\ntroublesome only when in the perfect or winged state.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Black-Rat Blister-Beetle~, (_Lytta murina_, Le Conte.)--This species\r\n(Fig. 8,) is entirely black. There is a very similar species, the black\r\nblister-beetle, (_Lytta atrata_, Fabr.,) from which the black-rat\r\nblister-beetle is distinguishable only by having four raised lines\r\nplaced lengthwise upon each wing-case, and by the two first joints of\r\nthe antennæ being greatly dilated and lengthened in the males, of the\r\nlath species. It is asserted by some authors that the black\r\nblister-beetle is injurious to the potato; but I can not see how it\r\ncould do much damage to that crop, as the perfect insect does not appear\r\nuntil late in August, when the potato crop is nearly out of its reach.\r\nNot so, however, with the black-rat blister-beetle, which is on hand\r\nready for business early in the season. This insect does considerable\r\ndamage to the potato in Iowa, and neighboring States; it is also found,\r\nthough in not so great numbers, throughout the whole of the Northern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Margined Blister-Beetle~, (_Lytta marginata_, Fabr.)--This species\r\n(Fig. 9) maybe at once recognized by its general black color, and the\r\nash-gray edging to its wing-cases. It usually feeds on certain wild\r\nplants, but does not object to a diet of potato-leaves. Though found\r\nover a large extent of country, it seldom appears in numbers large\r\nenough to damage the potato crop materially. Like other blister-beetles,\r\nit goes under ground to pass into the pupa state, and attacks the potato\r\nonly when it is in the perfect or winged state.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Three-Lined Leaf-Beetle~, (_Lema trilineata_, Olivier.) The larva of\r\nthe three-lined leaf-beetle may be distinguished from all other insects\r\nwhich prey upon the potato by its habit of covering itself with its own\r\nexcrement. In Figure 10, _a_, this larva is shown in profile, both full\r\nand half grown, covered with the soft, greenish excrementitious matter\r\nwhich from time to time it discharges. Figure 10, _c_, gives a somewhat\r\nmagnified view of the pupa, and Figure 10, _b_, shows the last few\r\njoints of the abdomen of the larva, magnified and viewed from above. The\r\nvent of the larva, as will be seen from this last figure, is situated on\r\nthe upper surface of the last joint, so that its excrement naturally\r\nfalls upon its back, and by successive discharges is crowded forward\r\ntoward its head, till the whole upper surface is covered with it. There\r\nare several other larva, feeding upon other plants, which wear cloaks of\r\nthis strange material.\r\n\r\nMany authors suppose that the object of the larva in all these cases is\r\nto protect itself from the heat of the sun. In all probability the real\r\naim of nature in the case of all these larvæ is to defend them from the\r\nattacks of birds and of cannibal and parasitic insects.\r\n\r\nThere are two broods of this insect every year. The first brood of larvæ\r\nmay be found on the potato-vine toward the latter end of June, and the\r\nsecond in August.\r\n\r\nThe first brood stays under ground about a fortnight before it emerges\r\nin the perfect beetle state, and the second brood stays under ground all\r\nwinter, and only emerges at the beginning of the following June.\r\n\r\nThe perfect beetle (Fig. 11) is of a pale yellow color, with three black\r\nstripes on its back, and bears a strong resemblance to the cucumber-bug,\r\n(_Diabrotica vittata_, Fabr. Fig. 12.)\r\n\r\nFrom this last species, however, it may be distinguished by its somewhat\r\nlarger size, and by the remarkable pinching-in of the thorax, so as to\r\nmake quite a lady-like waist there, or what naturalists call a\r\n\"constriction.\" The female, after coupling, lays her yellow eggs (Fig.\r\n10,_d_) on the under surface of the leaves of the potato plant. The\r\nlarvæ hatching, when full grown descend into the ground, where they\r\ntransform to pupæ (Fig. 10, _c_) within a small oval chamber, from which\r\nin time the perfect beetle emerges.\r\n\r\nThis insect in certain seasons is a great pest in the Eastern and Middle\r\nStates, but has never yet occurred in the Mississippi Valley in such\r\nnumbers as to be materially injurious.\r\n\r\n~The Cucumber Flea Beetle~, (_Haltica cucumeris_, Harris.) This nimble\r\nminute beetle (Fig. 13) belongs to the flea-beetles, (_Haltica_ family,)\r\nthe same sub-group of the leaf-beetles (_Phytophaga_) to which also\r\nappertains the notorious steel-blue flea-beetle (_Haltica chalybea_,\r\nIlliger) that is such a pest to the vineyardist. Like all the rest of\r\nthe flea-beetles, it has its hind thighs greatly enlarged, which enables\r\nit to jump with much agility. It is not peculiar to the potato, but\r\ninfests a great variety of plants, including the cucumber, from which it\r\nderives its name. It eats minute round holes in the leaf of the plant it\r\ninfests, but does not always penetrate entirely through it.\r\n\r\nThe larva feeds internally upon the substance of the leaf, and goes\r\nunder ground to assume the pupa state. It passes through all its stages\r\nin about a month, and there are two or three broods of them in the\r\ncourse of the same season. This is emphatically the greatest insect pest\r\nthat the potato-grower has to contend with in Pennsylvania. It abounds\r\nthroughout most of the Northern, Middle, and Western States. Large\r\nfields of potatoes can any summer be seen in the Middle States much\r\ninjured by this minute insect, every leaf apparently completely riddled\r\nwith minute round holes, and the stalks and leaves appearing yellow and\r\nseared. Plaster frequently and bountifully applied is sure to prevent\r\nthe attacks of this insect, or to disperse it after it has commenced\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n~The Colorado Potato-Bug~, (_Doryphora_ 10--_lineata_, Say.)--This insect,\r\nwhich, according to Dr. Walsh, has in the North-West alone damaged the\r\npotato crop to the amount of one million seven hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars, came originally from the Rocky Mountains, where it was\r\nfound forty-five years ago, feeding on a wild species of potato peculiar\r\nto that region, (_Solanum rostratum_, Dunal.) When civilization marched\r\nup the Rocky Mountains, and potatoes began to be grown in that region,\r\nthis highly improved pest acquired the habit of feeding upon the\r\ncultivated potato. It went from potato-patch to potato-patch, moving\r\neast-ward at the rate of about sixty miles a year, and is now firmly\r\nestablished over all the country extending from Indiana to its old\r\nfeeding-grounds in the Rocky Mountains. In about twelve years it will\r\nhave reached the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThere is another very closely allied species, known as the Bogus\r\nColorado potato-bug, (_coryphora juncta_, Germor,) which has existed\r\nthroughout a great part of the United States from time immemorial. This\r\nlatter insect, however, feeds almost exclusively on the horse-nettle,\r\n(_Solanum carolinense_, Linn.,) and is never known to injure the potato.\r\nBoth insects are figured, so that one need not be mistaken for the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFigure 14, _b_, _b_, _b_, gives a view of the larva of the true Colorado\r\npotato-bug, in various positions and stages of its existence. Figure 15,\r\n_b_, _b_, of that of the bogus Colorado potato-bug. It will be seen at\r\nonce that the head of the former is black, and the first joint behind\r\nthe head is pale and edged with black behind only; that there is a\r\ndouble row of black spots along the side of the body; and that the legs\r\nare black. In the other larva, (Fig. 15, _b_,) on the contrary, the head\r\nis of a pale color, the first joint behind the head is tinged with dusk\r\nand edged all round with black; there is but a single row of spots along\r\nthe side of the body, and the legs are pale.\r\n\r\nFigure 14, _d_, _d_, exhibits the true Colorado potato-bug; Figure 15,\r\nthe bogus Colorado potato-bug; each of its natural size. Figure 14, _e_,\r\nshows the _left_ wing-case enlarged, and Figure 15, _e_, an enlarged leg\r\nof the latter. On a close inspection, it will be perceived that in the\r\nformer (Fig. 14, _e_) the boundary of each dark stripe on the wing-cases\r\ntoward the middle is studded with confused and irregular punctures,\r\npartly inside and partly outside the edge of the dark stripe; that it is\r\nthe third and fourth dark stripes, counting from the outside, that are\r\nunited behind, and that both the knees and feet are black.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 15, _d_, on the contrary, it is the second and third\r\nstripes--not the third and fourth--counting from the outside, that are\r\nunited behind, and the leg is entirely pale, except a black spot on the\r\nmiddle of the front of the thigh. The eggs (Fig. 14, _a_, _a_, and Fig.\r\n15, _d_, _d_) are yellow, and are always laid on the under side of the\r\nleaf in patches of from twenty to thirty; those of the bogus are of a\r\nlighter color. Each female of the true Colorado potato-bug lays,\r\naccording to Dr. Schirmer, about seven hundred eggs. In about six days\r\nthe eggs hatch into larvæ, which feed on the foliage of the potato plant\r\nabout seventeen days; they then descend to the ground, where they change\r\ninto pupæ at the surface of the earth. The perfect beetle appears about\r\nten to fourteen days after the pupa is formed, begins to pair in about\r\nseven days, and on the fourteenth day begins to deposit her eggs. There\r\nare three broods of this insect every year. Neither geese, ducks,\r\nturkeys, nor barn-yard fowl will touch the larva of the Colorado\r\npotato-bug when it is offered to them, and there are numerous authentic\r\ncases on record where persons who have scalded to death quantities of\r\nthese larvæ, and inhaled the fumes of their bodies, have been taken\r\nseriously ill, and even been confined to their beds for many days in\r\nconsequence. It is also reported to have produced poisonous effects on\r\nseveral persons who handled them incautiously with naked hands. Various\r\nplans have been tried to destroy this persistent enemy of the potato\r\nplant. Powdered hellebore is said to have been used with effect as a\r\nmeans of destroying the pest. It should be dusted on and under the\r\nfoliage when the plant is wet with dew. Hellebore, however, is a\r\ndangerous remedy on account of its poisonous qualities. A mixture of one\r\npart salt, ten parts soap, and twenty parts water, applied to every part\r\nof the plants with a syringe, is quite effectual. Several cannibal and\r\none parasitic insect are known to prey upon the larva of the Colorado\r\npotato-bug, and the eggs in vast numbers are eaten by several species of\r\nlady-birds and their larva.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS ON INSECTS.\r\n\r\nThe time is not far distant when the American farmer will be obliged to\r\nput forth greater efforts to destroy noxious insects than he has\r\nhitherto. It is a well-known fact that noxious insects are increasing in\r\na rapid rate throughout every part of our land. The country is becoming\r\nso \"buggy\" that eternal vigilance is the price of every thing produced\r\nfrom the soil.\r\n\r\nClose observers calculate that more fruits of various kinds and\r\nvarieties are annually destroyed or rendered worthless by insects than\r\nare gathered and used by man. The cotton-worm, the wheat-midge, the\r\ncanker-worms, the potato-bugs, are each every year increasing in numbers\r\nand destructiveness.\r\n\r\nThe \"curculio\" alone destroys millions of dollars' worth of fruit\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nIt is a safe estimate, all things considered, that, if noxious insects\r\nof all descriptions could at once be annihilated throughout our country,\r\nand mildews of various classes be effectually held in check, the cost of\r\nliving to our people would, in-a short time, be reduced to one third of\r\nits present amount. It is disheartening to see what a vast amount of\r\ngrains, fruits, and vegetables is annually eaten up by the larvæ, or\r\nappropriated by the perfect insects of various classes, merely for the\r\nsake of propagating their abominable species. Yet, in view of all the\r\ndevastation, but feeble effort is made to abate the evil. Birds, many\r\nspecies of which nature seemingly designed on purpose to keep insects in\r\ncheck, are wantonly shot by lazy boys and indolent men, who range the\r\nfields and forests, killing all, from the humming-bird to the crow.\r\nLegislative enactments made expressly to protect the insectivorous\r\nsongsters are every day violated with impunity. One man plants an\r\norchard and does all he can to destroy noxious insects; another man near\r\nhim also has an orchard, but his orchard serves no purpose but to\r\npropagate \"curculios,\" \"canker-worms,\" \"bark-lice,\" \"tent caterpillars,\"\r\n\"codling moths,\" etc., for his neighbors, and, as a matter of course,\r\nthe whole neighborhood swarms with noxious insects. If all cultivators\r\nwould act in concert and with a will, insects might be reduced in\r\nnumbers very rapidly. Most moths of night-flying insects are attracted\r\nto and destroyed by small bonfires kindled in still evenings during the\r\nsummer months.\r\n\r\nBottles half-filled with sweetened water, hung here and there, will trap\r\ncountless bugs. Strong soap-suds applied immediately after they hatch is\r\na sure remedy for plant lice. Molasses and water, to which a little\r\narsenic has been added, placed in shallow dishes among the vines, is\r\ngood medicine for potato-bugs, and all bugs in general. A lighted lamp\r\nplaced in the centre of a common milk-pan, partly filled with water, the\r\nwhole elevated a few feet from the ground, will, on a still evening,\r\nattract and destroy the wheat-midge and similar insects in great\r\nnumbers. The calculations of the \"curculio\" and \"codling moth\" are\r\nbrought to naught by turning hogs into the orchard to eat the stung\r\nfruit as it falls, and the larva that depastures upon the leaves of the\r\ncurrent and gooseberry is destroyed by syringing the plants with a\r\nmixture of soap, salt, and water.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF THE POTATO AS CATTLE FOOD.\r\n\r\nThe constituents of the potato are according to different authorities,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n   Water                 75.2\r\n   Casein                 1.4\r\n   Starch                15.5\r\n   Dextrine               0.4\r\n   Sugar                  3.2\r\n   Fat                    0.2\r\n   Fibre                  3.2\r\n   Mineral matter         0.9\r\n\r\n     Or economically:\r\n   Water                 75.2\r\n   Flesh-formers          1.4\r\n   Fat-formers           18.9\r\n   Accessories            3.6\r\n   Mineral matter         0.9\r\n\r\nOf the high value of potatoes, when used in connection with other food,\r\nthere is not a shadow of doubt. All experimenters and observers in the\r\neconomy of food agree in saying that they are of the highest utility;\r\nbut they must be used with other food whose constituents are different\r\nfrom those of the root.\r\n\r\nThe analysis shows that potatoes surpass in the fat-producing principles\r\nthe nutritious or flesh-forming in such proportions that they could not\r\nalone sustain the composition of the blood; for an animal fed alone on\r\nthese tubers would be obliged to consume such quantities to provide the\r\nblood with the requisite proportion of albumen that, even if the process\r\nof digestion were not discontinued, there would be a superabundance of\r\nfat accumulated beyond the power of the oxygen to consume, which would\r\nsuccessively absorb from the albuminous substance a part of its vital\r\nelements, and thus a check would be caused in the endless change of\r\nmatter in the tissues in the nutritive and regressive transformations.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, then, to be of most value as food for cattle, should be fed in\r\nconnection with grain, or with other roots in which the flesh-forming\r\nelement predominates. There seems to be no doubt that the tubers are of\r\nmost value when cooked, although some authors affirm to the contrary. It\r\nseems possible to prove this on philosophical principles; for it is well\r\nknown that the starch contained in the potato is incapable of affording\r\nnourishment until the containing globules are broken, and one of the\r\nmost efficient means of doing this seems to be by heat.\r\n\r\nBoussingault, in speaking of the economy of cooking potatoes, says, \"The\r\npotato is frequently steamed or boiled first; yet I can say positively\r\nthat horned cattle do extremely well upon raw potatoes, and at\r\nBechelbrunn our cows never have them otherwise than raw. They are never\r\nboiled, save for horses and hogs. The best mode of dealing with them is\r\nto steam them; they need never be so thoroughly boiled as when they are\r\nto serve for the food of man. The steamed or boiled potatoes are crushed\r\nbetween two rollers, or simply broken with a wooden spade, and mixed\r\nwith cut hay or straw or chaff, before being served out. It may not be\r\nunnecessary to observe that by steaming potatoes lose no weight; hence\r\nwe conclude that the nutritive equivalent for the boiled is the same as\r\nthat of the raw tuber.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it is possible that the amylaceous principle is rendered\r\nmore easily assimilable by boiling, and that by this means the tubers\r\nactually become more nutritious. Some have proposed to roast potatoes in\r\nthe oven, and there can be little question that heated in this way they\r\nanswer admirably for fattening hogs, and even oxen. Done in the oven,\r\npotatoes may be brought to a state in which they may perfectly supply\r\nthe place of corn in feeding horses and other cattle.\"\r\n\r\nThe apparent contradiction in the remarks will be observed; but the\r\nevident leaning in favor of cooked potatoes shows that Boussingault,\r\nalthough paying some attention to the theory that cooked food is not\r\ngenerally attended with the same benefit to ruminating as to other\r\nanimals, was evidently almost convinced that those which contained an\r\nabundance of starch in their constituents must be rendered more\r\nnutritious when exposed to the action of heat.\r\n\r\nPotatoes fed in a raw state to stock are laxative in their effects, and\r\nare often given to horses as a medicine in cases of \"hidebound\" with\r\ndecided benefit. Bots, which have been known to live twenty-four hours\r\nimmersed in spirits of turpentine, die almost instantly when placed in\r\npotato-juice; hence a common practice with horsemen, where bots are\r\nsuspected, is to first administer milk and molasses to decoy the\r\nparasites from the coating of the stomach, and then drench the animal\r\nwith the expressed juice of potatoes. A decoction made by boiling the\r\nparings of potatoes in a small quantity of water is often used as a wash\r\nto kill vermin on cattle. Raw potatoes, fed occasionally and in small\r\nquantities, are a good tonic for stock of any kind which is kept\r\nprincipally on hay; but all experiments show that when the potato is\r\nused for fattening purposes, the tubers should in some way be cooked,\r\nthat the animal to which they are fed may derive from them the greatest\r\npossible amount of nutriment. Repeated experiments demonstrate the fact\r\nthat horned cattle or hogs lay on as much fat from the consumption of\r\ntwo thirds of a given quantity of potatoes properly cooked as they will\r\nby eating the entire quantity in a raw state. In point of nutriment as\r\ncattle-food, two pounds of potatoes are considered equivalent to one\r\npound of hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO COOK THE POTATO.\r\n\r\nFURNISHED BY\r\n\r\nPROF. PIERRE BLOT, OF BROOKLYN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of a number of friends, I addressed the following note\r\nto Professor Blot, which, with his reply, is appended:\r\n\r\n                                                PROFESSOR PIERRE BLOT:\r\n                                              NEW-YORK, Feb. 15, 1870.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: In connection with a Prize Essay on the cultivation of the\r\npotato, I wish to publish an article on COOKING THE POTATO, to be taken\r\nfrom your _Hand-Book of Practical Cookery_. I write this note to ask\r\nwhether I can do this with your entire approval. Hoping that such\r\narticle may aid our American housekeepers to prepare the potato for the\r\ntable in a more palatable and wholesome manner, I remain yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\n                                                          W. T. WYLIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BROOKLYN, CENTRAL KITCHEN, Feb. 15, 1870.\r\n\r\n  REV. W. T. WYLIE:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: ~You are authorized, with the greatest pleasure.~ P. BLOT.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the above authority, the following selections have\r\nbeen made from the book named:\r\n\r\n~To Select.~--As a general rule, the smaller the eye the better the\r\npotatoes. By cutting off a piece from the larger end, you ascertain if\r\nthey are sound; they must be white, reddish, bluish, etc., according to\r\nthe species. If spotted, they are not sound, and therefore very\r\ninferior. There are several kinds, and all of them are good when sound\r\nor coming from a proper soil. Use the kind you prefer, or those that are\r\nbetter fit for the way they are intended to be served.\r\n\r\n~To Boil.~--Being naturally watery, potatoes should never be cooked by\r\nboiling except when wanted very white, as for _croquettes_. When boiled\r\nwhole, put them of an even size as much as possible, in order to cook\r\nthem evenly. They are better, more mealy, when steamed or baked; but\r\nthose who have no steamer must, of course, boil them. Cover them with\r\ncold water, set on the fire and boil till done, then pour off all the\r\nwater, put the pan back on a slow fire for five minutes and well\r\ncovered; then use the potatoes.\r\n\r\n~To Steam.~--Place them above a kettle of boiling water, in a kind of\r\ndrainer made for that purpose, and adapted to the kettle. The drainer\r\nmust be covered tight. They cook as fast as by boiling, the degree of\r\nheat being the same. When steamed the skin is very easily removed.\r\n\r\n~To Prepare.~--If they are to be boiled, or steamed, or baked, it is only\r\nnecessary to wash them. If wanted peeled, as for frying, etc., then\r\ncommence by cutting off the germs or eyes; if young and tender, take the\r\nskin off with a scrubbing-brush, and drop immediately in cold water to\r\nkeep them white; if old, scrape the skin off with a knife, for the part\r\nimmediately under the skin contains more nutriment than the middle, and\r\ndrop in cold water also. If wanted cut, either in dice, or like carpels\r\nof oranges, or any other way, cut them above a bowl of cold water, so\r\nthat they drop into it; for if kept exposed to the air, they turn\r\nreddish and lose their nutritive qualities.\r\n\r\n~A l'Allemande.~--Steam, peel, and slice the potatoes. Cut some bread in\r\nthin slices, and fry bread and potatoes with a little butter, and turn\r\nthe whole in a bowl, dust well with sugar, pour a little milk all over,\r\nand bake for about fifteen minutes; serve warm.\r\n\r\n~A l'Anglaise.~--Steam or boil about a quart of potatoes, and then peel\r\nand slice them. Put two ounces of butter in a frying-pan on the fire,\r\nand put the potatoes in when melted, toss them for about ten minutes,\r\nadd salt, pepper, a little grated nutmeg, and serve hot.\r\n\r\n~Broiled.~--Steam, peel, and slice the potatoes. Lay the slices on a\r\ngridiron, and place it over a rather slow fire; have melted butter, and\r\nspread some over the slices of potatoes with a brush; as soon as the\r\nunder part is broiled, turn each slice over and spread butter over the\r\nother side. When done, dish, salt, and serve them hot. A little butter\r\nmay be added when dished, according to taste.\r\n\r\n~Fried.~--To be fried, the potatoes are cut either with a vegetable spoon,\r\nin fillets, in slices, with a scalloped knife, or with an ordinary one,\r\nor cut in pieces like carpels of oranges, or even in dice. When cut,\r\ndrain and wipe them dry. This must be done quickly, so as not to allow\r\nthe potatoes to turn reddish. Have a coarse towel ready, then turn the\r\npotatoes into a colander, and immediately turn them in the towel, shake\r\nthem a little, and quickly drop them in hot fat. When done, turn them\r\ninto a colander, sprinkle salt on them, and serve hot. Bear in mind that\r\nfried potatoes must be eaten as hot as possible. Fry only one size at a\r\ntime, as it takes three times as long to fry them when cut in pieces as\r\nwhen sliced or cut in fillets.\r\n\r\n~To fry them light or swelled.~--When fried, turn into the colander, and\r\nhave the fat over a brisk fire; leave the potatoes in the colander only\r\nabout half a minute, then put them back in the very hot fat, stir for\r\nabout one minute, and put them again in the colander, salt them, and\r\nserve hot. If the fat is very hot, when dropped into it for the second\r\ntime they will certainly swell; there is no other way known to do it. It\r\nis as easily done as it is simple. Potatoes cut in fillets and fried are\r\nsometimes called _à la Parisienne_; when cut in slices or with a\r\nvegetable spoon, they are called _à la française_.\r\n\r\nPotatoes cut with a vegetable spoon and fried, make a good as well as a\r\nsightly decoration for a dish of meat or of fish. They may be fried in\r\noil also, but it is more expensive than in fat. They may be fried in\r\nbutter also, but it is still more expensive than oil, and is not better\r\nthan fat; no matter what kind of fat is used, be it lard, beef suet, or\r\nskimmings of sauces and gravy, it can not be tasted.\r\n\r\n~Lyonnaise.~--Potatoes _Lyonnaise_ are prepared according to taste, that\r\nis, as much onion as liked is used, either in slices or chopped. If you\r\nhave not any cold potatoes, steam or boil some, let them cool, and peel\r\nand slice them. For about a quart of potatoes, put two ounces of butter\r\nin a frying-pan on the fire, and when melted put as much onion as you\r\nplease, either sliced or chopped, into the pan, and fry it till about\r\nhalf done, when add the potatoes and again two ounces of butter; salt,\r\npepper, and stir and toss gently till the potatoes are all fried of a\r\nfine, light-brown color. It may require more butter, as no vegetable\r\nabsorbs more than potatoes.\r\n\r\n~Mashed.~--Peel and quarter about three pints of potatoes, as directed;\r\nput them in a saucepan with more water than is necessary to cover them,\r\nand a little salt; set on the fire and boil gently till done, drain, put\r\nthem back in the saucepan, mash them well and mix them with two ounces\r\nof butter, two yolks of eggs, salt, pepper, and milk enough to make them\r\nof a proper thickness. Set on the fire for two or three minutes,\r\nstirring the while, and serve warm. When on the dish, smooth them with\r\nthe back of a knife or scallop them, according to fancy.\r\n\r\n~Mashed and Baked.~--Put two ounces of butter in a stewpan and set it on\r\nthe fire; when hot, add a tea-spoonful of parsley chopped fine, and a\r\nlittle salt; five minutes after, put in it a quart of potatoes,\r\nprepared, cooked, peeled, and mashed, as directed; then pour on the\r\nwhole, little by little, stirring continually with a wooden spoon, a\r\npint of good milk; and when the whole is well mixed, and becoming rather\r\nthick, take from the fire, place on the dish, then set in a brisk oven\r\nfor five minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\n~Sautees.~--Take a quart of young and tender potatoes, peel them with a\r\nbrush, and cut in slices. Put two ounces of butter in a frying-pan on a\r\nquick fire; when hot, put the potatoes in, and fry them till of a golden\r\ncolor; place them on a dish without any butter, sprinkle chopped parsley\r\nand salt on, and serve. They may also be served without parsley,\r\naccording to taste.\r\n\r\n~Soufflees.~--Steam a quart of potatoes, then peel and mash them in a\r\nsaucepan and mix an ounce of butter with them; set on the fire, pour\r\ninto it, little by little, stirring the while, about half a pint of\r\nmilk, stir a little longer after the milk is in and until they are\r\nturning rather thick; dish the potatoes, smooth or scallop them with the\r\nback of a knife, and put them in a quick oven till of a proper color,\r\nand serve.\r\n\r\n~In Cakes.~--Prepare and cook by steam a quart and a half of potatoes,\r\npeel and mash them; mix with them the yolks of five eggs, half a\r\nlemon-rind grated, and four ounces of fine white sugar. Put four ounces\r\nof butter in a stewpan and set it on the fire; when melted, put the\r\nmixture in, stirring it with a wooden spoon continually; as soon as it\r\nis in the stewpan, add the whites of the five eggs, well beaten; leave\r\non the fire only the time necessary to mix the whole well together, and\r\ntake off; when nearly cold, add, if handy, and while stirring, a few\r\ndrops of orange-flower water; it gives a very good flavor; then put the\r\nwhole in a tin mould greased a little with butter; place in a quick oven\r\nfor about thirty-five minutes, and serve.\r\n\r\n~With Butter, or English Fashion.~--Put water on the fire with\r\nconsiderable salt in it; at the first boil, drop a quart of washed\r\npotatoes in and boil till done, when take off, peel, and put them whole\r\nin a saucepan, with butter, salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg; set on a\r\nrather slow fire, stirring gently now and then till they have absorbed\r\nall the butter. Serve warm. They absorb a great deal of butter.\r\n\r\n~With Bacon or Salt Pork.~--Peel and quarter about a quart of potatoes.\r\nSet a saucepan on the fire with about four ounces of fat salt pork cut\r\nin dice in it. When fried, put the potatoes in. Season with a bunch of\r\nseasonings composed of two sprigs of parsley, one of thyme, and a\r\nbay-leaf; salt and pepper to taste, and about half a pint of broth or\r\nwater. Boil gently till cooked, remove the bunch of seasonings; skim off\r\nthe fat, if any, and serve warm. It is served at breakfast, as well as\r\n_entremets_ for dinner.\r\n\r\n~With Cream or Milk.~--Peel and mash a quart of potatoes, when prepared\r\nand cooked. Put two ounces of butter in a stewpan and set it on a good\r\nfire; when melted, sprinkle in it a tea-spoonful of flour, same of\r\nchopped parsley, a pinch of grated nutmeg, and salt; stir with a wooden\r\nspoon five minutes; then add the potatoes, and half a pint of milk or\r\ncream; keep stirring ten minutes longer, take from the fire, sprinkle in\r\nthem half a table-spoonful of sugar, and serve as warm as possible.\r\n\r\n~With White Sauce.~--Clean, wash, and throw a quart of potatoes in boiling\r\nwater, with a sprig of thyme, two onions, a bay-leaf, two sprigs of\r\nsweet basil, two cloves, salt, and pepper; when cooked, take the\r\npotatoes out carefully, peel and cut them in two, place them on a warm\r\ndish, pour on them a white sauce, and serve warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POTATO:\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe propose to add a few pages of illustrations of the new varieties,\r\ntogether with descriptions of the same. A number of these were given in\r\nthe pamphlet issued last year, and are reproduced from that. In case a\r\nnew edition is called for, it is likely that a number of additional cuts\r\nwill be added to it.\r\n\r\nWe would call attention to the report of a series of experiments which\r\nhave been made on the farms connected with the Agricultural College of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThere are very many questions connected with the cultivation of the\r\npotato which can be answered satisfactorily only by careful and repeated\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Excelsior.]\r\n\r\nSeedling of Early Goodrich, now six years old, and is claimed to combine\r\nmore good qualities than any other potato.

Ripens from six to ten days\r\nearlier than the Rose, of uniform large size and but few small ones, and\r\nperfectly free from Core or Hollow Heart, and a superior Winter and\r\nSpring variety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brezee's Prolific._\r\n\r\nThis variety originated with Albert Brezee, Esq., of Hubbardton, Vt., in\r\n1861. Mr. Brezee was the originator of the Early Rose, the seed\r\nproducing both that and Brezee's Prolific being from the same seed-ball,\r\nand both are seedlings of the Garnet Chili.\r\n\r\nThe vines of Brezee's Prolific are of medium height, quite bushy, and\r\nsomewhat spreading, and with very large leaves; as yet they have\r\nproduced no seed-balls. Tubers large, regular in shape, and very smooth,\r\nslightly oblong, and very much flattened; skin dull white, inclined to\r\nbe russeted; eyes but little depressed and slightly pinkish; flesh\r\nwhite, rarely if ever hollow; cooks quickly, and is very mealy and of\r\nexcellent quality. Yield very large, maturing three weeks later than the\r\nEarly Rose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rules Worth Observing._--An experienced cultivator says, \"My experience\r\nleads me to lay down the following as _safe rules_:\r\n\r\n\"I. As early as possible, _lay your plans_ for the next season's\r\nplanting, and manure and work your ground accordingly, in advance.\r\n\r\n\"II. Secure the _best seed_, even if it cost you two or five times as\r\nmuch as a common and less valuable sort.\r\n\r\n\"III. _Always_ get a new, improved variety, as soon as it has been\r\ntested and proved. _Remember_ the profit is mainly made by the early\r\ncultivators. When it gets so common that _you_ can buy cheap, you will\r\nhave to _sell_ cheap, too.\r\n\r\n\"IV. Buy only from reliable dealers, and _be sure_ you get the _genuine_\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n\"V. BUY, or at least ORDER, if you possibly can, in the fall or winter;\r\nyou thus save the spring rise of prices.\r\n\r\n\"VI. Liberal outlay for _seed, manure, tools, and work_ gives ten-fold\r\nthe largest return in money, as well as satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLEASON.\r\n\r\nAlso a seedling of 1860, of the Pink Eye Rusty Coat, No. 15, which it\r\nclosely resembles. When two years old, Mr. Goodrich described it thus:\r\n\"Longish, rusty, coppery; leaves and vines dark green; flowers white; a\r\nvery hopeful sort.\" September 29th, 1863, at digging time, he added:\r\n\"Very nice; many in the hill; no disease.\" The two seasons, 1865 and\r\n1866, under Dr. Gray's cultivation, this variety yielded at the rate of\r\nfour hundred bushels to the acre, being more productive than the parent.\r\nThis variety gives the best satisfaction. The tubers are not overgrown,\r\nbut numerous; have fine-grained, solid flesh, that cooks white. For\r\nwinter use this kind is excellent. It is a good keeper, and has a fine,\r\nrich flavor, especially when baked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Willard._\r\n\r\nJ. J. H. Gregory says of this potato: \"The Willard is a seedling from\r\nthe Early Goodrich. It proves to be a half early variety, enormously\r\nproductive, and is a potato of good promise. It is of a rich rose color,\r\nspotted and splashed with white. The flesh is white.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY ROSE.\r\n\r\n\"It is a seedling of the Garnet Chili, that was originated in 1861, by\r\nAlbert Brezee, Esq., an intelligent farmer of Hortonville, Vt. I have\r\nexperimented with it for three years, and have been so well pleased with\r\nit that I have purchased all Mr. Brezee could spare for the last two\r\nyears, and have engaged the whole of his small crop for another year.\r\n\r\n\"It has a stout, erect stalk, of medium height; large leaves; flowers\r\nfreely; bears no fruit. The tuber is quite smooth, nearly cylindrical,\r\nvarying to flattish at the centre, tapering gradually toward each end.\r\nEyes shallow, but sharp and strongly marked. Skin thin, tough, of a dull\r\nbluish color. Flesh white, solid, and brittle; rarely hollow; boils\r\nthrough quickly; is very mealy, and of the best table quality. It is as\r\nhealthy and productive as the Early Goodrich, matures about ten days\r\nearlier, and is its superior for the table. The cut is a good outline of\r\nthis beautiful and excellent sort.\r\n\r\n\"I consider it the most promising very early potato with which I am\r\nacquainted, and I have tried nearly all the early sorts of the country.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_~How to Double Your Crop, when you have New and Rare Kinds.~_--In an\r\nordinary hot-bed or cold frame, put some six inches of good, loose, rich\r\nsoil; split your potato, and lay it cut side down about three inches\r\nunder the surface. When the sprouts are four or five inches high, lift\r\nthe potato, slip off the sprouts, and plant them.\r\n\r\nYou can then cut the tuber into single eyes, and plant as usual. The\r\ncrop from the sprouts will ripen two weeks before the others. I made $40\r\nthis year by trying this with a _handful_ of potatoes. Every reader is\r\nwelcome to it, and may make as much or more than I did, if he secures a\r\nfew pounds of the newer and costly but valuable kinds.\r\n                                                                    W.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early Goodrich._\r\n\r\nA seedling of the Cusco of 1860. In 1862, Mr. Goodrich described it:\r\n\"Round to longish; sometimes a crease at the insertion of the root;\r\nwhite; flowers bright lilac; (produces) many balls; yield large. Table\r\nquality is already very good. This sort is No. 1 every way.\" He said to\r\nme in the spring of 1864: \"This early sort gives me more satisfaction\r\nthan any other I have ever grown.\" This variety ripens as early as the\r\nAshleaf Kidney; on rich soil yields from 250 to 350 bushels per acre;\r\nhas never shown any disease; is white-fleshed, and of superior quality.\r\n\r\nThe above description by D. S. Heffron is fully sustained by my\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nI noticed at dinner to-day, (Nov. 17th,) every potato in a large dishful\r\nhad cracked its skin, and from most of them the skin had peeled itself\r\nhalf off.\r\n                                                                    W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Rev. W. F. Dixon_, of Pine Grove, gives the results of his experience\r\nin the following note:\r\n\r\n                                         \"PINE GROVE, MERCER CO., PA.,\r\n                                                   September 20, 1868.\r\n\r\n\"A year ago last spring, a friend gave me three early Goodrich potatoes,\r\nwhich I planted four eyes in a hill, and last fall I raised over one\r\nbushel. I had the Buckeye planted in the same lot. The Goodrich produced\r\nabout four times as much to the hill as the Buckeye.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur country may well honor the memory of Rev. C. E. Goodrich, who, by\r\npersevering experiments and patient toil, has produced such wonderful\r\nresults. His success should stimulate every farmer to make a similar\r\nline of experiments.\r\n\r\n_Potato Crop of New York State._--The total potato crop of the State of\r\nNew York, this year, is about 25,000,000 bushels. The six great potato\r\ncounties are Washington, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Monroe, St. Lawrence, and\r\nGenesee. Only one other county (Oneida) produces 300,000 bushels; three\r\nothers, 600,000; one, 500,000; six, 400,000. New York county returns a\r\ncrop of 1700 bushels. The entire crop of the State, 25,000,000 bushels,\r\nis raised on 254,403 acres of land. The three counties in the State\r\nwhich produce the most potatoes join each other, viz., Washington,\r\nRensselaer, and Saratoga--their aggregate production reaching within a\r\nfraction of 2,500,000 bushels, or more than one-eighth of the total\r\nproduct of the whole State.--_New York Observer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARISON.\r\n\r\nMr. Heffron gives the following account of this variety: \"It is a\r\nbrother of the Early Goodrich--a seedling of the Cusco of 1860. When two\r\nyears old, Mr. Goodrich described it thus: 'White, large, not so deep\r\neyes as the parent, nice.'\" In 1863, Mr. Goodrich had eleven and a half\r\nbushels; and though it was a bad year for disease, and this a young and\r\ntender seedling, when he overhauled his seedlings, January 29th, 1864,\r\nhe made this entry in his book: \"All perfect, fine.\"\r\n\r\nIt has a smooth white skin, white flesh, and is the most solid of large\r\npotatoes, having no hollow at the centre. It is enormously productive,\r\nyielding as well as the parent Cusco, and exceeds all others; its form\r\nis good, table quality excellent; keeps well; ripens ten days earlier\r\nthan the Garnet Chili, and thus far is as hardy as the Garnet Chili.\r\n\r\nAmong winter sorts this potato must soon hold as high a place as is\r\nconceded to the Early Goodrich among the early sorts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Keep Potatoes during Winter._--As soon as dry after digging, pick up\r\nand handle carefully; store in a dry, well-aired, cool cellar, free from\r\nfrost, either in bins raised a little from the bottom of the cellar, or\r\nin barrels having at least two holes bored through the staves near the\r\nbottom, and lay the top head on, over a lath, so as to exclude the light\r\nwithout preventing a free circulation of air. Also sprinkle among the\r\npotatoes about half a pint of recently slacked quick-lime to each\r\nbarrel. If bins are used, cover them over sufficiently to exclude the\r\nmost of the light. Air the cellar all winter, as often as the\r\ntemperature outside will admit of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMAX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt has a stout, erect stalk, of full medium height, internodes of medium\r\nlength, and very large leaves; the tuber is above medium in size, quite\r\nsmooth, in form of a short cylinder swelled out at the centre,\r\noccasionally slightly flattened, and terminating rather abruptly; eyes\r\nshallow, sharp, sometimes swelled out or projecting, and always strongly\r\ndefined; skin medium thickness, considerably netted or russet, tough,\r\nwhite; flesh entirely white, solid, heavy, brittle, and never hollow,\r\nand it boils through quickly, with no hard core at centre or stem, is\r\nmealy, of floury whiteness, and of superior table quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Early Prince._\r\n\r\nThe _Early Prince_ is a seedling of the Early York, and was propagated\r\nin 1864. It has proved to be from a week to ten days earlier than the\r\nEarly Rose, as far as size and solidity are concerned, and from two to\r\nthree weeks earlier in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHED IN 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Good, Cheap, and very Valuable Paper for Every Man, Woman, and Child\r\n\r\nIN CITY, VILLAGE, AND COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nAMERICAN AGRICULTURIST,\r\n\r\nFOR THE\r\n\r\nFarm, Garden, and Household,\r\n\r\nIncluding a Special Department of Interesting and Instructive Reading\r\nfor Children and Youth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE AGRICULTURIST is a large periodical of _forty-four_ quarto pages,\r\nbeautifully printed, filled with _plain, practical, reliable, original_\r\nmatter, and containing hundreds of _beautiful and instructive\r\nEngravings_ in every annual volume.\r\n\r\nIt contains each month a Calendar of Operations to be performed on the\r\n_Farm_, in the _Orchard_ and _Garden_, in and around the _Dwelling_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe thousands of hints and suggestions given in every volume are\r\nprepared by practical, intelligent _workingmen_, who know what they\r\nwrite about.\r\n\r\nThe _Household Department_ is valuable to every housekeeper, affording\r\nvery many useful hints and directions calculated to lighten and\r\nfacilitate indoor work.\r\n\r\nThe _Department for Children and Youth_ is prepared with special care,\r\nto furnish not only amusement, but also to inculcate knowledge and sound\r\nmoral principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS--English Edition.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of THE AMERICAN AGRICULTURIST is so large that it can be\r\nfurnished (_postage prepaid by the publishers_) at the low price of\r\n$1.50 a year; four copies, one year, for $5; six copies, one year, for\r\n$7; ten or more copies, one year, $1 each; single copies, 15 cents each.\r\n\r\n  TRY IT A YEAR.\r\n\r\n~A German Edition,~ containing all the principal articles and engravings\r\nof the English Edition, and other matter of special interest to\r\nGerman-Americans, is furnished at the same rates as above stated for the\r\nEnglish Edition, _postage prepaid by the publishers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ORANGE JUDD COMPANY, Publishers and Proprietors,\r\n  No. 751 Broadway, New York City.",
