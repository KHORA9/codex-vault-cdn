By a similar\r\narrangement made with the family since his decease, they will also\r\npublish his POSTHUMOUS WORKS, of which the present volume is the first.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrotyped by W. F. Draper, Andover, Mass.\r\n\r\nPrinted by Geo. C. Rand & Avery, Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturalists of every class know too well how HUGH MILLER died--the\r\nvictim of an overworked brain; and how that bright and vigorous spirit\r\nwas abruptly quenched forever.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May (1857) Mrs. Miller came to Malvern, after\r\nrecovering from the first shock of bereavement, in search of health and\r\nrepose, and evidently hoping to do justice, on her recovery, to the\r\nliterary remains of her husband. Unhappily the excitement and anxiety\r\nnaturally attaching to a revision of her husband's works proved over\r\nmuch for one suffering under such recent trial, and from an affection of\r\nthe brain and spine which ensued; and, in consequence, Mrs. Miller has\r\nbeen forbidden, for the present, to engage in any work of mental labor.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, and at Mrs. Miller's request, I have\r\nundertaken the editing of \"The Cruise of the Betsey, or a Summer Ramble\r\namong the Fossiliferous Deposits of the Hebrides,\" as well as \"The\r\nRambles of a Geologist,\" hitherto unpublished, save as a series of\r\narticles in the \"Witness\" newspaper. The style and arguments of HUGH\r\nMILLER are so peculiarly his own, that I have not presumed to alter the\r\ntext, and have merely corrected some statements incidental to the\r\ncondition of geological knowledge at the time this work was penned. \"The\r\nCruise of the Betsey\" was written for that well-known paper the\r\n\"Witness\" during the period when a disputation productive of much bitter\r\nfeeling waged between the Free and Established Churches of Scotland; but\r\nas the Disruption and its history possesses little interest to a large\r\nclass of the readers of this work, who will rejoice to follow their\r\nfavorite author among the isles and rocks of the \"bonnie land,\" I have\r\nexpunged _some_ passages, which I am assured the author would have\r\nomitted had he lived to reprint this interesting narrative of his\r\ngeological rambles. HUGH MILLER battled nobly for his faith while\r\nliving. The sword is in the scabbard: let it rest!\r\n\r\n W.S.

Chisels and hammers, and the bag for specimens, were taken\r\nfrom their corner in the dark closet, and packed up with half a stone\r\nweight of a fine _soft_ Conservative Edinburgh newspaper, valuable for a\r\nquality of preserving old things entire. At noon on St. Swithin's day\r\n(Monday the 15th), I was speeding down the Clyde in the Toward Castle\r\nsteamer, for Tobermory in Mull. In the previous season I had intended\r\npassing direct from the Oolitic deposits of the eastern coast of\r\nScotland, to the Oolitic deposits of the Hebrides. But the weeks glided\r\nall too quickly away among the ichthyolites of Caithness and Cromarty,\r\nand the shells and lignites of Sutherland and Ross. My friend, too, the\r\nRev. Mr. Swanson, of Small Isles, on whose assistance I had reckoned,\r\nwas in the middle of his troubles at the time, with no longer a home in\r\nhis parish, and not yet provided with one elsewhere; and I concluded he\r\nwould have but little heart, at such a season, for breaking into rocks,\r\nor for passing from the too pressing monstrosities of an existing state\r\nof things, to the old lapidified monstrosities of the past. And so my\r\ndesign on the Hebrides had to be postponed for a twelvemonth. But my\r\nfriend, now afloat in his Free Church yacht, had got a home on the sea\r\nbeside his island charge, which, if not very secure when nights were\r\ndark and winds loud, and the little vessel tilted high to the long roll\r\nof the Atlantic, lay at least beyond the reach of man's intolerance, and\r\nnot beyond the protecting care of the Almighty. He had written me that\r\nhe would run down his vessel from Small Isles to meet me at Tobermory,\r\nand in consequence of the arrangement I was now on my way to Mull.\r\n\r\nSt. Swithin's day, so important in the calendar of our humbler\r\nmeteorologists, had in this part of the country its alternate fits of\r\nsunshine and shower. We passed gaily along the green banks of the Clyde,\r\nwith their rich flat fields glittering in moisture, and their lines of\r\nstately trees, that, as the light flashed out, threw their shadows over\r\nthe grass. The river expanded into the estuary, the estuary into the\r\nopen sea; we left behind us beacon, and obelisk, and rock-perched\r\ncastle;--\r\n\r\n       \"Merrily down we drop\r\n Below the church, below the tower,\r\n       Below the light house top,\"\r\n\r\nand, as the evening fell, we were ploughing the outer reaches of the\r\nFrith, with the ridgy table-land of Ayrshire stretching away, green, on\r\nthe one side, and the serrated peaks of Arran rising dark and high on\r\nthe other. At sunrise next morning our boat lay, unloading a portion of\r\nher cargo, in one of the ports of Islay, and we could see the Irish\r\ncoast resting on the horizon to the south and west, like a long\r\nundulating bank of thin blue cloud; with the island of Rachrin--famous\r\nfor the asylum it had afforded the Bruce when there was no home for him\r\nin Scotland,--presenting in front its mass of darker azure. On and away!\r\nWe swept past Islay, with its low fertile hills of mica-schist and\r\nslate; and Jura, with its flat dreary moors, and its far-seen gigantic\r\npaps, on one of which, in the last age, Professor Walker, of Edinburgh,\r\nset water a-boil with six degrees of heat less than he found necessary\r\nfor the purpose on the plain below. The Professor describes the view\r\nfrom the summit, which includes in its wide circle at once the Isle of\r\nSkye and the Isle of Man, as singularly noble and imposing; two such\r\nprospects more, he says, would bring under the eye the whole island of\r\nGreat Britain, from the Pentland Frith to the English Channel. We sped\r\npast Jura. Then came the Gulf of Coryvrekin, with the bare mountain\r\nisland of Scarba overlooking the fierce, far-famed whirlpool, that we\r\ncould see from the deck, breaking in long lines of foam, and sending out\r\nits waves in wide rings on every side, when not a speck of white was\r\nvisible elsewhere in the expanse of sea around us. And then came an\r\nopener space, studded with smaller islands,--mere hill-tops rising out\r\nof the sea, with here and there insulated groups of pointed rocks, the\r\nskeletons of perished hills, amid which the tide chafed and fretted, as\r\nif laboring to complete on the broken remains their work of denudation\r\nand ruin.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of land and water on this coast suggests the idea that\r\nthe Western Highlands, from the line in the interior, whence the rivers\r\ndescend to the Atlantic, with the islands beyond to the outer Hebrides,\r\nare all parts of one great mountainous plane, inclined slantways into\r\nthe sea. First, the long withdrawing valleys of the main land, with\r\ntheir brown mossy streams, change their character as they dip beneath\r\nthe sea-level, and become salt-water lochs. The lines of hills that rise\r\nover them jut out as promontories, till cut off by some transverse\r\nvalley, lowered still more deeply into the brine, and that exists as a\r\nkyle, minch, or sound, swept twice every tide by powerful currents. The\r\nsea deepens as the plain slopes downward; mountain-chains stand up out\r\nof the water as larger islands, single mountains as smaller ones, lower\r\neminences as mere groups of pointed rocks; till at length, as we pass\r\noutwards, all trace of the submerged land disappears, and the wide ocean\r\nstretches out and away its unfathomable depths. The model of some Alpine\r\ncountry raised in plaster on a flat board, and tilted slantways, at a\r\nlow angle, into a basin of water, would exhibit, on a minute scale, an\r\nappearance exactly similar to that presented by the western coast of\r\nScotland and the Hebrides. The water would rise along the hollows,\r\nlongitudinal and transverse, forming sounds and lochs, and surround,\r\nisland-like, the more deeply submerged eminences. But an examination of\r\nthe geology of the coast, with its promontories and islands,\r\ncommunicates a different idea. These islands and promontories prove to\r\nbe of very various ages and origin. The _outer_ Hebrides may have\r\nexisted as the inner skeleton of some ancient country, contemporary with\r\nthe main land, and that bore on its upper soils the productions of\r\nperished creations, at a time when by much the larger portion of the\r\n_inner_ Hebrides,--Skye, and Mull, and the Small Isles,--existed as part\r\nof the bottom of a wide sound, inhabited by the Cephalopoda and\r\nEnaliosaurians of the Lias and the Oolite. Judging from its components,\r\nthe Long Island, like the Lammermoors and the Grampians, may have been\r\nsmiling to the sun when the Alps and the Himalaya Mountains lay buried\r\nin the abyss; whereas the greater part of Skye and Mull must have been,\r\nlike these vast mountain-chains of the Continent, an oozy sea-floor,\r\nover which the ligneous productions of the neighboring lands, washed\r\ndown by the streams, grew heavy and sank, and on which the belemnite\r\ndropped its spindle and the ammonite its shell. The idea imparted of\r\n_old_ Scotland to the geologist here,--of Scotland, proudly,\r\naristocratically, supereminently old,--for it can call Mont Blanc a mere\r\nupstart, and Dhawalageri, with its twenty-eight thousand feet of\r\nelevation, a heady fellow of yesterday,--is not that of a land settling\r\ndown by the head, like a foundering vessel, but of a land whose hills\r\nand islands, like its great aristocratic families, have arisen from the\r\nlevel in very various ages, and under the operation of circumstances\r\nessentially diverse.\r\n\r\nWe left behind us the islands of Lunga, Luing, and Seil, and entered the\r\nnarrow Sound of Kerrera, with its border of Old Red conglomerate resting\r\non the clay-slate of the district. We had passed Esdaile near enough to\r\nsee the workmen employed in the quarries of the island, so extensively\r\nknown in commerce for their roofing slate, and several small vessels\r\nbeside them, engaged in loading; and now we had got a step higher in the\r\ngeological scale, and could mark from the deck the peculiar character of\r\nthe conglomerate, which, in cliffs washed by the sea, when the binding\r\nmatrix is softer than the pebbles which it encloses, roughens, instead\r\nof being polished, by the action of the waves, and which, along the\r\neastern side of the Sound here, seems as if formed of cannon-shot, of\r\nall sizes, embedded in cement. The Sound terminates in the beautiful bay\r\nof Oban, so quiet and sheltered, with its two island breakwaters in\r\nfront,--its semi-circular sweep of hill behind,--its long white-walled\r\nvillage, bent like a bow, to conform to the inflection of the\r\nshore,--its mural precipices behind, tapestried with ivy,--its rich\r\npatches of green pasture,--its bosky dingles of shrub and tree,--and,\r\nperched on the seaward promontory, its old, time-eaten keep. \"In one\r\npart of the harbor of Oban,\" says Dr. James Anderson, in his \"Practical\r\nTreatise on Peat Moss,\" (1794), \"where the depth of the sea is about\r\ntwenty fathoms, the bottom is found to consist of quick peat, which\r\naffords no safe anchorage.\" I made inquiry at the captain of the\r\nsteamer, regarding this submerged deposit, but he had never heard of it.\r\nThere are, however, many such on the coasts of both Britain and Ireland.\r\nWe staid at Oban for several hours, waiting the arrival of the Fort\r\nWilliam steamer; and, taking out hammer and chisel from my bag, I\r\nstepped ashore to question my ancient acquaintance, the Old Red\r\nconglomerate, and was fortunate enough to meet on the pier-head, as I\r\nlanded, one of the best of companions for assisting in such work, Mr.\r\nColin Elder, of Isle Ornsay,--the gentleman who had so kindly furnished\r\nmy friend Mr. Swanson with an asylum for his family, when there was no\r\nlonger a home for them in Small Isles. \"You are much in luck,\" he said,\r\nafter our first greeting: \"one of the villagers, in improving his\r\ngarden, has just made a cut for some fifteen or twenty yards along the\r\nface of the precipice behind the village, and laid open the line of\r\njunction between the conglomerate and the clay-slate. Let us go and see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nI found several things worthy of notice in the chance section to which I\r\nwas thus introduced. The conglomerate lies uncomfortably along the edges\r\nof the slate strata, which present under it an appearance exactly\r\nsimilar to that which they exhibit under the rolled stones and shingle\r\nof the neighboring shore, where we find them laid bare beside the\r\nharbor, for several hundred yards. And, mixed with the pebbles of\r\nvarious character and origin of which the conglomerate is mainly\r\ncomposed, we see detached masses of the slate, that still exhibit on\r\ntheir edges the identical lines of fracture characteristic of the rock,\r\nwhich they received, when torn from the mass below, myriads of ages\r\nbefore. In the incalculably remote period in which the conglomerate base\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone was formed, the clay-slate of this district had\r\nbeen exactly the same sort of rock that it is now. Some long anterior\r\nconvulsion had upturned its strata, and the sweep of water, mingled with\r\nbroken fragments of stone, had worn smooth the exposed edges, just as a\r\nsimilar agency wears the edges exposed at the present time. Quarries\r\nmight have been opened in this rock, as now, for a roofing-slate, had\r\nthere been quarriers to open them, or houses to roof over; it was in\r\nevery respect as ancient a looking stone then as in the present late age\r\nof the world. There are no sermons that seem stranger or more impressive\r\nto one who has acquired just a little of the language in which they are\r\npreached, than those which, according to the poet, are to be found in\r\nstones; a bit of fractured slate, embedded among a mass of rounded\r\npebbles, proves voluble with ideas of a kind almost too large for the\r\nmind of man to grasp. The eternity that hath passed is an ocean without\r\na further shore, and a finite conception may in vain attempt to span it\r\nover. But from the beach, strewed with wrecks, on which we stand to\r\ncontemplate it, we see far out towards the cloudy horizon, many a dim\r\nislet and many a pinnacled rock, the sepulchres of successive eras,--the\r\nmonuments of consecutive creations: the entire prospect is studded over\r\nwith these landmarks of a hoar antiquity, which, measuring out space\r\nfrom space, constitute the vast whole a province of time; nor can the\r\neye reach to the open, shoreless infinitude beyond, in which only God\r\nexisted; and, as in a sea-scene in nature, in which headland stretches\r\ndim and blue beyond headland, and islet beyond islet, the distance seems\r\nnot lessened, but increased, by the crowded objects--we borrow a\r\nlarger, not a smaller idea of the distant eternity, from the vastness of\r\nthe measured periods that occur between.\r\n\r\nOver the lower bed of conglomerate, which here, as on the east coast, is\r\nof great thickness, we find a bed of gray stratified clay, containing a\r\nfew calcareo-argillaceous nodules. The conglomerate cliffs to the north\r\nof the village present appearances highly interesting to the geologist.\r\nRising in a long wall within the pleasure-grounds of Dunolly castle, we\r\nfind them wooded atop and at the base; while immediately at their feet\r\nthere stretches out a grassy lawn, traversed by the road from the\r\nvillage to the castle, which sinks with a gradual slope into the\r\nexisting sea-beach, but which ages ago must have been a sea-beach\r\nitself. We see the bases of the precipices hollowed and worn, with all\r\ntheir rents and crevices widened into caves; and mark, at a picturesque\r\nangle of the rock, what must have been once an insulated sea-stack, some\r\nthirty or forty feet in height, standing up from amid the rank grass, as\r\nat one time it stood up from amid the waves. Tufts of fern and sprays of\r\nivy bristle from its sides, once roughened by the serrated kelp-weed and\r\nthe tangle. The Highlanders call it M'Dougal's Dog-stone, and say that\r\nthe old chieftains of Lorne made use of it as a post to which to fasten\r\ntheir dogs,--animals wild and gigantic as themselves,--when the hunters\r\nwere gathering to rendezvous, and the impatient beagles struggled to\r\nbreak away and begin the chase on their own behalf. It owes its\r\nexistence as a stack--for the precipice in which it was once included\r\nhas receded from around it for yards--to an immense boulder in its\r\nbase--by far the largest stone I ever saw in an Old Red conglomerate.\r\nThe mass is of a rudely rhomboidal form, and measures nearly twelve feet\r\nin the line of its largest diagonal. A second huge pebble in the same\r\ndetached spire measures four feet by about three. Both have their edges\r\nmuch rounded, as if, ere their deposition in the conglomerate, they had\r\nbeen long exposed to the wear of the sea; and both are composed of an\r\nearthy amygdaloidal trap. I have stated elsewhere [\"Old Red Sandstone,\"\r\nChapter XII.], that I had scarce ever seen a stone in the Old Red\r\nconglomerate which I could not raise from the ground; and ere I said so\r\nI had examined no inconsiderable extent of this deposit, chiefly,\r\nhowever, along the eastern coast of Scotland, where its larger pebbles\r\nrarely exceed two hundred weight. How account for the occurrence of\r\npebbles of so gigantic a size here? We can but guess at a solution, and\r\nthat very vaguely. The islands of Mull and Kerrera form, in the present\r\nstate of things, inner and outer breakwaters between what is now the\r\ncoast of Oban and the waves of the Atlantic; but Mull, in the times of\r\neven the Oolite, must have existed as a mere sea-bottom; and Kerrera,\r\ncomposed mainly of trap, which has brought with it to the surface\r\npatches of the conglomerate, must, when the conglomerate was in forming,\r\nhave been a mere sea-bottom also. Is it not possible, that when the\r\nbreakwaters _were not_, the Atlantic _was_, and that its tempests, which\r\nin the present time can transport vast rocks for hundreds of yards along\r\nthe exposed coasts of Shetland and Orkney, may have been the agent here\r\nin the transport of these huge pebbles of the Old Red conglomerate?\r\n\"Rocks that two or three men could not lift,\" say the Messrs. Anderson\r\nof Inverness, in describing the storms of Orkney, \"are washed about even\r\non the tops of cliffs, which are between sixty and a hundred feet above\r\nthe surface of the sea, when smooth; and detached masses of rock, of an\r\nenormous size, are well known to have been carried a considerable\r\ndistance between low and high-water mark.\" \"A little way from the\r\nBrough,\" says Dr. Patrick Neill, in his 'Tour through Orkney and\r\nShetland,' \"we saw the prodigious effects of a late winter storm: many\r\ngreat stones, one of them of several tons weight, had been tossed up a\r\nprecipice twenty or thirty feet high, and laid fairly on the green\r\nsward.\" There is something farther worthy of notice in the stone of\r\nwhich the two boulders of the Dog-stack are composed. No species of rock\r\noccurs more abundantly in the embedded pebbles of this ancient\r\nconglomerate than rocks of the trap family. We find in it\r\ntrap-porphyries, greenstones, clinkstones, basalts, and amygdalolds,\r\nlargely mingled with fragments of the granitic, clay-slate, and quartz\r\nrocks. The Plutonic agencies must have been active in the locality for\r\nperiods amazingly protracted; and many of the masses protruded at a very\r\nearly time seem identical in their composition with rocks of the trap\r\nfamily, which in other parts of the country we find referred to much\r\nlater eras. There occur in this deposit rolled pebbles of a basalt,\r\nwhich in the neighborhood of Edinburgh would be deemed considerably more\r\nmodern than the times of the Mountain Limestone, and in the Isle of\r\nSkye, considerably more modern than the times of the Oolite.\r\n\r\nThe sunlight was showering its last slant rays on island and loch, and\r\nthen retreating upwards along the higher hills, chased by the shadows,\r\nas our boat quitted the bay of Oban, and stretched northwards, along the\r\nend of green Lismore, for the Sound of Mull. We had just enough of day\r\nleft, as we reached mid sea, to show us the gray fronts of the three\r\nancient castles,--- which at this point may be at once seen from the\r\ndeck,--Dunolly, Duart, and Dunstaffnage; and enough left us as we\r\nentered the Sound, to show, and barely show, the Lady Rock, famous in\r\ntradition, and made classic by the pen of Campbell, raising its black\r\nback amid the tides, like a belated porpoise. And then twilight\r\ndeepened into night, and we went snorting through the Strait with a\r\nstream of green light curling off from either bow in the calm, towards\r\nthe high dim land, that seemed standing up on both sides like tall\r\nhedges over a green lane. We entered the Bay of Tobermory about\r\nmidnight, and cast anchor amid a group of little vessels. An exceedingly\r\nsmall boat shot out from the side of a yacht of rather diminutive\r\nproportions, but tautly rigged for her size, and bearing an outrigger\r\nastern. The water this evening was full of phosphoric matter, and it\r\ngleamed and sparkled around the little boat like a northern aurora\r\naround a dark cloudlet. There was just light enough to show that the\r\noars were plied by a sailor-like man in a Guernsey frock, and that\r\nanother sailor-like man,--the skipper, mayhap,--attired in a cap and\r\npea-jacket, stood in the stern. The man in the Guernsey frock was John\r\nStewart, sole mate and half the crew of the Free Church yacht Betsey;\r\nand the skipper-like man in the pea-jacket was my friend the minister of\r\nthe Protestants of Small Isles. In five minutes more I was sitting with\r\nMr. Elder beside the little iron stove in the cabin of the Betsey; and\r\nthe minister, divested of his cap and jacket, but still looking the\r\nveritable skipper to admiration, was busied in making us a rather late\r\ntea.\r\n\r\nThe cabin,--my home for the greater part of the three following weeks,\r\nand that of my friend for the greater part of the previous\r\ntwelvemonth,--I found to be an apartment about twice the size of a\r\ncommon bed, and just lofty enough under the beams to permit a man of\r\nfive feet eleven to stand erect in his night-cap. A large table, lashed\r\nto the floor, furnished with tiers of drawers of all sorts and sizes,\r\nand bearing a writing desk bound to it a-top, occupied the middle space,\r\nleaving just room enough for a person to pass between its edges and the\r\nnarrow coffin-like beds in the sides, and space enough at its fore-end\r\nfor two seats in front of the stove. A jealously barred skylight opened\r\nabove; and there depended from it this evening a close lantern-looking\r\nlamp, sufficiently valuable, no doubt, in foul weather, but dreary and\r\ndim on the occasions when all one really wished from it was light. The\r\npeculiar furniture of the place gave evidence to the mixed nature of my\r\nfriend's employment. A well-thumbed chart of the Western Islands lay\r\nacross an equally well-thumbed volume of Henry's \"Commentary.\" There was\r\na Polyglot and a spy-glass in one corner, and a copy of Calvin's\r\n\"Institutes,\" with the latest edition of \"The Coaster's Sailing\r\nDirections,\" in another; while in an adjoining state-room, nearly large\r\nenough to accommodate an arm-chair, if the chair could have but\r\ncontrived to get into it, I caught a glimpse of my friend's printing\r\npress and his case of types, canopied overhead by the blue ancient of\r\nthe vessel, bearing, in stately six-inch letters of white bunting, the\r\nlegend, \"FREE CHURCH YACHT.\" A door opened, which communicated with the\r\nforecastle, and John Stewart, stooping very much, to accommodate himself\r\nto the low-roofed passage, thrust in a plate of fresh herrings,\r\nsplendidly toasted, to give substantiality and relish to our tea. The\r\nlittle rude forecastle, a considerably smaller apartment than the cabin,\r\nwas all a-glow with the bright fire in the coppers, itself invisible; we\r\ncould see the chain-cable dangling from the hatchway to the floor, and\r\nJohn Stewart's companion, a powerful-looking, handsome young man, with\r\nbroad bare breast, and in his shirt-sleeves, squatted full in front of\r\nthe blaze, like the household goblin described by Milton, or the\r\n\"Christmas Present\" of Dickens. Mr. Elder left us for the steamer, in\r\nwhich he prosecuted his voyage next morning to Skye; and we tumbled in,\r\neach to his narrow bed,--comfortable enough sort of resting places,\r\nthough not over soft; and slept so soundly, that we failed to mark Mr.\r\nElder's return for a few seconds, a little after daybreak. I found at my\r\nbedside, when I awoke, a fragment of rock which he had brought from the\r\nshore, charged with Liasic fossils; and a note he had written, to say\r\nthat the deposit to which it belonged occurred in the trap immediately\r\nabove the village-mill; and further, to call my attention to a house\r\nnear the middle of the village, built of a mouldering red sandstone,\r\nwhich had been found _in situ_ in digging the foundations. I had but\r\nlittle time for the work of exploration in Mull, and the information\r\nthus kindly rendered enabled me to economize it.\r\n\r\nThe village of Tobermory resembles that of Oban. A quiet bay has its\r\nsecure island-breakwater in front; a line of tall, well-built houses,\r\nnot in the least rural in their aspect, but that seem rather as if they\r\nhad been transported from the centre of some stately city entire and at\r\nonce, sweeps round its inner inflection, like a bent bow; and an\r\namphitheatre of mingled rock and wood rises behind. With all its beauty,\r\nhowever, there hangs about the village an air of melancholy. Like some\r\nof the other western coast villages, it seems not to have grown,\r\npiece-meal, as a village ought, but to have been made wholesale, as\r\nFrankenstein made his man; and to be ever asking, and never more\r\nincessantly than when it is at its quietest, why it should have been\r\nmade at all? The remains of the Florida, a gallant Spanish ship, lie off\r\nits shores, a wreck of the Invincible Armada, \"deep whelmed,\" according\r\nto Thompson,\r\n\r\n                           \"What time,\r\n Snatched sudden by the vengeful blast,\r\n The scattered vessels drove, and on blind shelve,\r\n And pointed rock that marks th' indented shore,\r\n Relentless dashed, where loud the northern main\r\n Howls through the fractured Caledonian isles.\"\r\n\r\nMacculloch relates, that there was an attempt made, rather more than a\r\ncentury ago, to weigh up the Florida, which ended in the weighing up of\r\nmerely a few of her guns, some of them of iron greatly corroded; and\r\nthat, on scraping them, they became so hot under the hand that they\r\ncould not be touched, but that they lost this curious property after a\r\nfew hours' exposure to the air. There have since been repeated instances\r\nelsewhere, he adds, of the same phenomenon, and chemistry has lent its\r\nsolution of the principles on which it occurs; but, in the year 1740,\r\nere the riddle was read, it must have been deemed a thoroughly magical\r\none by the simple islanders of Mull. It would seem as if the guns,\r\nheated in the contest with Drake, Hawkins, and Frobisher, had again\r\nkindled, under some supernatural influence, with the intense glow of the\r\nlost battle.\r\n\r\nThe morning was showery; but it cleared up a little after ten, and we\r\nlanded to explore. We found the mill a little to the south of the\r\nvillage, where a small stream descends, all foam and uproar, from the\r\nhigher grounds along a rocky channel half-hidden by brushwood; and the\r\nLiasic bed occurs in an exposed front directly over it, coped by a thick\r\nbed of amygdaloidal trap. The organisms are numerous; and, when we dig\r\ninto the bank beyond the reach of the weathering influences, we find\r\nthem delicately preserved, though after a fashion that renders difficult\r\ntheir safe removal. Originally the bed must have existed as a brown\r\nargillaceous mud, somewhat resembling that which forms in the course of\r\nyears, under a scalp of muscles; and it has hardened into a more\r\nsilt-like clay, in which the fossils occur, not as petrifactions, but\r\nas shells in a state of decay, except in some rare cases, in which a\r\ncalcareous nodule has formed within or around them. Viewed in the group,\r\nthey seem of an intermediate character, between the shells of the Lias\r\nand the Oolite. One of the first fossils I disinterred was the Gryphaea\r\nobliquata,--a shell characteristic of the Liasic formation; and the\r\nfossil immediately after, the Pholadomy aequalis, a shell of the Oolitic\r\none. There occurs in great numbers a species of small Pecten,--some of\r\nthe specimens scarce larger than a herring scale; a minute Ostrea, a\r\nsulcated Terebratula, an Isocardia, a Pullastra, and groups of broken\r\nserpulae in vast abundance. The deposit has also its three species of\r\nAmmonite, existing as mere impressions in the clay; and at least two\r\nspecies of Belemnite,--one of the two somewhat resembling the Belemnites\r\nabbreviatus, but smaller and rather more elongated: while the other, of\r\na spindle form, diminishing at both ends, reminds one of the Belemnites\r\nminimus of the Gault. The Red Sandstone in the centre of the village\r\noccurs detached, like this Liasic bed, amid the prevailing trap, and may\r\nbe seen _in situ_ beside the southern gable of the tall, deserted\r\nlooking house at the hill-foot, that has been built of it. It is a soft,\r\ncoarse-grained, mouldering stone, ill fitted for the purposes of the\r\narchitect; and more nearly resembles the New Red Sandstone of England\r\nand Dumfriesshire, than any other rock I have yet seen in the north of\r\nScotland. I failed to detect in it aught organic.\r\n\r\nWe weighed anchor about two o'clock, and beat gallantly out the Sound,\r\nin the face of an intermittent baffling wind and a heavy swell from the\r\nsea. I would fain have approached nearer the precipices of Ardnamurchan,\r\nto trace along their inaccessible fronts the strange reticulations of\r\ntrap figured by Macculloch; but prudence and the skipper forbade our\r\ntrusting even the docile little Betsey, on one of the most formidable\r\nlee shores in Scotland, in winds so light and variable, and with the\r\nswell so high. We could hear the deep roar of the surf for miles, and\r\nsee its undulating strip of white flickering under stack and cliff. The\r\nscenery here seems rich in legendary association. At one tack we bore\r\ninto Bloody Bay, on the Mull coast,--the scene of a naval battle between\r\ntwo island chiefs; at another, we approached, on the mainland, a cave\r\ninaccessible save from the sea, long the haunt of a ruthless Highland\r\npirate. Ere we rounded the headland of Ardnamurchan, the slant light of\r\nevening was gleaming athwart the green acclivities of Mull, barring them\r\nwith long horizontal lines of shadow, where the trap terraces rise step\r\nbeyond step, in the characteristic stair-like arrangement to which the\r\nrock owes its name; and the sun set as we were bearing down in one long\r\ntack on the Small Isles. We passed the Isle of Muck, with its one low\r\nhill; saw the pyramidal mountains of Rum looming tall in the offing; and\r\nthen, running along the Isle of Eigg, with its colossal Scuir rising\r\nbetween us and the sky, as if it were a piece of Babylonian wall, or of\r\nthe great wall of China, only vastly larger, set down on the ridge of a\r\nmountain, we entered the channel which separates the island from one of\r\nits dependencies, Eilean Chaisteil, and cast anchor in the tideway,\r\nabout fifty yards from the rocks. We were now at home,--the only home\r\nwhich the proprietor of the island permits to the islanders' minister;\r\nand, after getting warm and comfortable over the stove and a cup of tea,\r\nwe did what all sensible men do in their own homes when the night wears\r\nlate,--got into bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     The Minister's Larder--No Harbor--Eigg Shoes--_Tormentilla\r\n     erecta_--For the _Witness'_ Sake--Eilean Chaisteil--Appearance of\r\n     Eigg--Chapel of St. Donan--Shell-sand--Origin of Secondary\r\n     Calcareous Rock suggested--Exploration of Eigg--Pitchstone Veins--A\r\n     Bone Cave--Massacre at Eigg--Grouping of Human Bones in the\r\n     Cave--Relics--The Horse's Tooth--A Copper Sewing Needle--Teeth\r\n     found--Man a worse Animal than his Teeth show him to have been\r\n     designed for--Story of the Massacre--Another Version--Scuir of\r\n     Eigg--The Scuir a Giant's Causeway--Character of the\r\n     Columns--Remains of a Prostrate Forest.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had rich tea this morning. The minister was among his people; and our\r\nfirst evidence of the fact came in the agreeable form of three bottles\r\nof fine fresh cream from the shore. Then followed an ample baking of\r\nnice oaten cakes. The material out of which the cakes were manufactured\r\nhad been sent from the minister's store aboard,--for oatmeal in Eigg is\r\nrather a scarce commodity in the middle of July; but they had borrowed a\r\ncrispness and flavor from the island, that the meal, left to its own\r\nresources, could scarcely have communicated; and the golden-colored\r\ncylinder of fresh butter which accompanied them was all the island's\r\nown. There was an ample supply of eggs too, as one not quite a conjuror\r\nmight have expected from a country bearing such a name,--eggs with the\r\nmilk in them; and, with cream, butter, oaten cakes, eggs, and tea, all\r\nof the best, and with sharp-set sea-air appetites to boot, we fared\r\nsumptuously. There is properly no harbor in the island. We lay in a\r\nnarrow channel, through which, twice every twenty-four hours, the tides\r\nsweep powerfully in one direction, and then as powerfully in the\r\ndirection opposite; and our anchors had a trick of getting foul, and\r\ncanting stock downwards in the loose sand, which, with pointed rocks all\r\naround us, over which the current ran races, seemed a very shrewd sort\r\nof trick indeed. But a kedge and halser, stretched thwartwise to a\r\nneighboring crag, and jammed fast in a crevice, served in moderate\r\nweather to keep us tolerably right. In the severer seasons, however, the\r\nkedge is found inadequate, and the minister has to hoist sail and make\r\nout for the open sea, as if served with a sudden summons of ejectment.\r\n\r\nAmong the various things brought aboard this morning, there was a pair\r\nof island shoes for the minister's cabin use, that struck my fancy not a\r\nlittle. They were all around of a deep madder red color, soles, welts\r\nand uppers; and, though somewhat resembling in form the little yawl of\r\nthe Betsey, were sewed not unskilfully with thongs; and their peculiar\r\nstyle of tie seemed of a kind suited to furnish with new idea a\r\nfashionable shoemaker of the metropolis. They were altogether the\r\nproduction of Eigg, from the skin out of which they had been cut, with\r\nthe lime that had prepared it for the tan, and the root by which the tan\r\nhad been furnished, down to the last on which they had been moulded, and\r\nthe artisan that had cast them off, a pair of finished shoes. There are\r\nfew trees, and, of course, no bark to spare, in the island; but the\r\nislanders find a substitute in the astringent lobiferous root of the\r\n_Tormentilla erecta_, which they dig out for the purpose among the\r\nheath, at no inconsiderable expense of time and trouble. I was informed\r\nby John Stewart, an adept in all the multifarious arts of the island,\r\nfrom the tanning of leather and the tilling of land, to the building of\r\na house or the working of a ship, that the infusion of root had to be\r\nthrice changed for every skin, and that it took a man nearly a day to\r\ngather roots enough for a single infusion. I was further informed that\r\nit was not unusual for the owner of a skin to give it to some neighbor\r\nto tan, and that, the process finished, it was divided equally between\r\nthem, the time and trouble bestowed on it by the one being deemed\r\nequivalent to the property held in it by the other. I wished to call a\r\npair of these primitive-looking shoes my own, and no sooner was the wish\r\nexpressed, than straightway one islander furnished me with leather, and\r\nanother set to work upon the shoes. When I came to speak of\r\nremuneration, however, the islanders shook their heads. \"No, no, not\r\nfrom the _Witness_: there are not many that take our part, and the\r\n_Witness_ does.\" I hold the shoes, therefore, as my first retainer,\r\ndetermined, on all occasions of just quarrel, to make common cause with\r\nthe poor islanders.\r\n\r\nThe view from the anchoring ground presents some very striking features.\r\nBetween us and the sea lies Eilean Chaisteil, a rocky trap islet, about\r\nhalf a mile in length by a few hundred yards in breadth; poor in\r\npastures, but peculiarly rich in sea-weed, of which John Stewart used,\r\nhe informed me, to make finer kelp, ere the trade was put down by act of\r\nParliament, than could be made elsewhere in Eigg. This islet bore, in\r\nthe remote past, its rude fort or dun, long since sunk into a few grassy\r\nmounds; and hence its name. On the landward side rises the island of\r\nEigg proper, resembling in outline two wedges, placed point to point on\r\na board. The centre is occupied by a deep angular gap, from which the\r\nground slopes upward on both sides, till, attaining its extreme height\r\nat the opposite ends of the island, it drops suddenly on the sea. In the\r\nnorthern rising ground the wedge-like outline is complete; in the\r\nsouthern one it is somewhat modified by the gigantic Scuir, which rises\r\ndirect on the apex of the height, _i.e._, the thick part of the wedge;\r\nand which, seen bows-on from this point of view, resembles some vast\r\ndonjon keep, taller, from base to summit, by about a hundred feet, than\r\nthe dome of St. Paul's. The upper slopes of the island are brown and\r\nmoory, and present little on which the eye may rest, save a few trap\r\nterraces, with rudely columnar fronts; its middle space is mottled with\r\npatches of green, and studded with dingy cottages, each of which this\r\nmorning, just a little before the breakfast hour, had its own blue\r\ncloudlet of smoke diffused around it; while along the beach, patches of\r\nlevel sand, alternated with tracts of green bank, or both, give place to\r\nstately ranges of basaltic columns, or dingy groups of detached rocks.\r\nImmediately in front of the central hollow, as if skilfully introduced,\r\nto relieve the tamest part of the prospect, a noble wall of\r\nsemi-circular columns rises some eighty or a hundred feet over the\r\nshore; and on a green slope, directly above, we see the picturesque\r\nruins of the Chapel of St. Donan, one of the disciples of Columba, and\r\nthe Culdee saint and apostle of the island.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that first struck me, as I got on deck this morning,\r\nwas the extreme whiteness of the sand. I could see it gleaming bright\r\nthrough the transparent green of the sea, three fathoms below our keel,\r\nand, in a little flat bay directly opposite, it presented almost the\r\nappearance of pulverized chalk. A stronger contrast to the dingy\r\ntrap-rocks around which it lies could scarce be produced, had contrast\r\nfor effect's sake been the object. On landing on the exposed shelf to\r\nwhich we had fastened our halser, I found the origin of the sand\r\ninterestingly exhibited. The hollows of the rock, a rough trachyte, with\r\na surface like that of a steel rasp, were filled with handfuls of broken\r\nshells thrown up by the surf from the sea-banks beyond: fragments of\r\nechini, bits of the valves of razor-fish, the island cyprina, mactridae,\r\nbuccinidae, and fractured periwinkles, lay heaped together in vast\r\nabundance. In hollow after hollow, as I passed shorewards, I found the\r\nfragments more and more comminuted, just as, in passing along the\r\nsuccessive vats of a paper-mill, one finds the linen rags more and more\r\ndisintegrated by the cylinders; and immediately beyond the inner edge of\r\nthe shelf, which is of considerable extent, lies the flat bay, the\r\nultimate recipient of the whole, filled to the depth of several feet,\r\nand to the extent of several hundred yards, with a pure shell-sand, the\r\ngreater part of which had been thus washed ashore in handfuls, and\r\nground down by the blended agency of the trachyte and the surf. Once\r\nformed, however, in this way it began to receive accessions from the\r\nexuviae of animals that love such localities,--the deep arenaceous bed\r\nand soft sand-beach; and these now form no inconsiderable proportion of\r\nthe entire mass. I found the deposit thickly inhabited by spatangi,\r\nrazor-fish, gapers, and large, well-conditioned cockles, which seemed to\r\nhave no idea whatever that they were living amid the debris of a charnel\r\nhouse. Such has been the origin here of a bed of shell-sand, consisting\r\nof many thousand tons, and of which at least eighty per cent. was once\r\nassociated with animal life. And such, I doubt not, is the history of\r\nmany a calcareous rock in the later secondary formations. There are\r\nstrata, not a few, of the Cretaceous and Oolitic groups, that would be\r\nfound--could we but trace their beginnings with a certainty and\r\nclearness equal to that with which we can unravel the story of this\r\ndeposit--to be, like it, elaborations from dead matter, made through the\r\nagency of animal secretion.\r\n\r\nWe set out on our first exploratory ramble in Eigg an hour before noon.\r\nThe day was bracing and breezy, and a clear sun looked cheerily down on\r\nisland, and strait, and blue open sea. We rowed southwards in our\r\nlittle boat, through the channel of Eilean Chaisteil, along the\r\ntrap-rocks of the island, and landed under the two pitchstone veins of\r\nEigg, so generally known among mineralogists, and of which specimens may\r\nbe found in so many cabinets. They occur in an earthy, greenish-black\r\namygdaloid, which forms a range of sea-cliffs varying in height from\r\nthirty to fifty feet, and that, from their sad hue and dull fracture,\r\nseem to absorb the light; while the veins themselves, bright and\r\nglistening, glitter in the sun, as if they were streams of water\r\ntraversing the face of the rock. The first impression they imparted, in\r\nviewing them from the boat, was, that the inclosing mass was a pitch\r\ncaldron, rather of the roughest and largest, and much begrimmed by soot,\r\nthat had cracked to the heat, and that the fluid pitch was forcing its\r\nway outwards through the rents. The veins expand and contract, here\r\ndiminishing to a strip a few inches across, there widening into a\r\ncomparatively broad belt, some two or three feet over; and, as well\r\ndescribed by M'Culloch, we find the inclosed pitchstone changing in\r\ncolor, and assuming a lighter or darker hue, as it nears the edge or\r\nrecedes from it. In the centre it is of a dull olive green, passing\r\ngradually into blue, which in turn deepens into black; and it is exactly\r\nat the point of contact with the earthy amygdaloid that the black is\r\nmost intense, and the fracture of the stone glassiest and brightest. I\r\nwas lucky enough to detach a specimen, which, though scarce four inches\r\nacross, exhibits the three colors characteristic of the vein,--its bar\r\nof olive green on the one side, of intense black on the other, and of\r\nblue, like that of imperfectly fused bottle-glass, in the centre. This\r\ncurious rock,--so nearly akin in composition and appearance to\r\nobsidian,--a mineral which, in its dense form, closely resembles the\r\ncoarse dark-colored glass of which common bottles are made, and which,\r\nin its lighter form, exists as pumice,--constitutes one of the links\r\nthat connect the trap with the unequivocally volcanic rocks. The one\r\nmineral may be seen beside smoking crater, as in the Lipari Isles,\r\npassing into pumice; while the other may be converted into a substance\r\nalmost identical with pumice, by the chemist. \"It is stated by the\r\nHonorable George Knox, of Dublin,\" says Mr. Robert Allan, in his\r\nvaluable mineralogical work, \"that the pitchstone of Newry, on being\r\nexposed to a high temperature, loses its bitumen and water, and is\r\nconverted into a light substance in every respect resembling pumice.\"\r\nBut of pumice in connection with the pitchstones of Eigg, more anon.\r\n\r\nLeaving our boat to return to the Betsey at John Stewart's leisure, and\r\ntaking with us his companion, to assist us in carrying such specimens as\r\nwe might procure, we passed westwards for a few hundred yards under the\r\ncrags, and came abreast of a dark angular opening at the base of the\r\nprecipice, scarce two feet in height, and in front of which there lies a\r\nlittle sluggish, ankle-deep pool, half mud, half water, and matted over\r\nwith grass and rushes. Along the mural face of the rock of earthy\r\namygdaloid there runs a nearly vertical line, which in one of the\r\nstratified rocks one might perhaps term the line of a fault, but which\r\nin a trap rock may merely indicate where two semi-molten masses had\r\npressed against each other without uniting--just as currents of cooling\r\nlead, poured by the plumber from the opposite end of a groove, sometimes\r\nmeet and press together, so as to make a close, polished joint, without\r\nrunning into one piece. The little angular opening forms the lower\r\ntermination of the line, which, hollowing inwards, recedes near the\r\nbottom into a shallow cave, roughened with tufts of fern and bunches of\r\nlong silky grass, here and there enlivened by the delicate flowers of\r\nthe lesser rock-geranium. A shower of drops patters from above among the\r\nweeds and rushes of the little pool. My friend the minister stopped\r\nshort. \"There,\" he said, pointing to the hollow, \"you will find such a\r\nbone cave as you never saw before. Within that opening there lie the\r\nremains of an entire race, palpably destroyed, as geologists in so many\r\nother cases are content merely to imagine, by one great catastrophe.\r\nThat is the famous cave of Frances (_Uamh Fraingh_), in which the whole\r\npeople of Eigg were smoked to death by the M'Leods.\"\r\n\r\nWe struck a light, and, worming ourselves through the narrow entrance,\r\ngained the interior,--a true rock gallery, vastly more roomy and lofty\r\nthan one could have anticipated from the mean vestibule placed in front\r\nof it. Its extreme length we found to be two hundred and sixty feet; its\r\nextreme breadth twenty-seven feet; its height, where the roof rises\r\nhighest, from eighteen to twenty feet. The cave seems to have owed its\r\norigin to two distinct causes. The trap-rocks on each side of the\r\nvertical fault-like crevice which separates them are greatly decomposed,\r\nas if by the moisture percolating from above; and directly in the line\r\nof the crevice must the surf have charged, wave after wave, for ages ere\r\nthe last upheaval of the land. When the Dog-stone at Dunolly existed as\r\na sea-stack, skirted with algae, the breakers on this shore must have\r\ndashed every tide through the narrow opening of the cavern, and scooped\r\nout by handfuls the decomposing trap within. The process of\r\ndecomposition, and consequent enlargement, is still going on inside, but\r\nthere is no longer an agent to sweep away the disintegrated fragments.\r\nWhere the roof rises highest, the floor is blocked up with accumulations\r\nof bulky decaying masses, that have dropped from above; and it is\r\ncovered over its entire area by a stratum of earthy rubbish, which has\r\nfallen from the sides and ceiling in such abundance, that it covers up\r\nthe straw beds of the perished islanders, which still exist beneath as a\r\nbrown mouldering felt, to the depth of from five to eight inches. Never\r\nyet was tragedy enacted on a gloomier theatre. An uncertain twilight\r\nglimmers gray at the entrance, from the narrow vestibule; but all\r\nwithin, for full two hundred feet, is black as with Egyptian darkness.\r\nAs we passed onward with our one feeble light, along the dark mouldering\r\nwalls and roof, which absorbed every straggling ray that reached them,\r\nand over the dingy floor, ropy and damp, the place called to\r\nrecollection that hall in Roman story, hung and carpeted with black,\r\ninto which Domitian once thrust his senate, in a frolic, to read their\r\nown names on the coffin-lids placed against the wall. The darkness\r\nseemed to press upon us from every side, as if it were a dense jetty\r\nfluid, out of which our light had scooped a pailful or two, and that was\r\nrushing in to supply the vacuum; and the only objects we saw distinctly\r\nvisible were each other's heads and faces, and the lighter parts of our\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nThe floor, for about a hundred feet inwards from the narrow vestibule,\r\nresembles that of a charnel-house. At almost every step we came upon\r\nheaps of human bones grouped together, as the Psalmist so graphically\r\ndescribes, \"as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.\" They\r\nare of a brownish, earthy hue, here and there tinged with green; the\r\nskulls, with the exception of a few broken fragments, have disappeared;\r\nfor travellers in the Hebrides have of late years been numerous and\r\ncurious; and many a museum,--that at Abbotsford among the\r\nrest,--exhibits, in a grinning skull, its memorial of the Massacre at\r\nEigg. We find, too, further marks of visitors in the single bones\r\nseparated from the heaps and scattered over the area; but enough still\r\nremains to show, in the general disposition of the remains, that the\r\nhapless islanders died under the walls in families, each little group\r\nseparated by a few feet from the others. Here and there the remains of a\r\ndetached skeleton may be seen, as if some robust islander, restless in\r\nhis agony, had stalked out into the middle space ere he fell; but the\r\nsocial arrangement is the general one. And beneath every heap we find,\r\nat the depth, as has been said, of a few inches, the remains of the\r\nstraw-bed upon which the family had lain, largely mixed with the smaller\r\nbones of the human frame, ribs and vertebrae, and hand and feet bones;\r\noccasionally, too, with fragments of unglazed pottery, and various other\r\nimplements of a rude housewifery. The minister found for me, under one\r\nfamily heap, the pieces of a half-burned, unglazed earthen jar, with a\r\nnarrow mouth, that, like the sepulchral urns of our ancient tumuli, had\r\nbeen moulded by the hand, without the assistance of the potter's wheel;\r\nand to one of the fragments there stuck a minute pellet of gray hair.\r\nFrom under another heap he disinterred the handle-stave of a child's\r\nwooden porringer (_bicker_), perforated by a hole still bearing the mark\r\nof the cord that had hung it to the wall; and beside the stave lay a few\r\nof the larger, less destructible bones of the child, with what for a\r\ntime puzzled us both not a little,--one of the grinders of a horse.\r\nCertain it was, no horse could have got there to have dropped a\r\ntooth,--a foal of a week old could not have pressed itself through the\r\nopening; and how the single grinder, evidently no recent introduction\r\ninto the cave, could have got mixed up in the straw with the human\r\nbones, seemed an enigma somewhat of the class to which the reel in the\r\nbottle belongs. I found in Edinburgh an unexpected commentator on the\r\nmystery, in the person of my little boy,--an experimental philosopher in\r\nhis second year. I had spread out on the floor the curiosities of\r\nEigg,--among the rest, the relics of the cave, including the pieces of\r\nearthern jar, and the fragment of the porringer; but the horse's tooth\r\nseemed to be the only real curiosity among them in the eyes of little\r\nBill. He laid instant hold of it; and, appropriating it as a toy,\r\ncontinued playing with it till he fell asleep. I have now little doubt\r\nthat it was first brought into the cave by the poor child amid whose\r\nmouldering remains Mr. Swanson found it. The little pellet of gray hair\r\nspoke of feeble old age involved in this wholesale massacre with the\r\nvigorous manhood of the island; and here was a story of unsuspecting\r\ninfancy amusing itself on the eve of destruction with its toys. Alas,\r\nfor man! \"Should not I spare Nineveh, that great city,\" said God to the\r\nangry prophet, \"wherein are more than six score thousand persons that\r\ncannot discern between their right hand and their left?\" God's image\r\nmust have been sadly defaced in the murderers of the poor inoffensive\r\nchildren of Eigg, ere they could have heard their feeble wailings,\r\nraised, no doubt, when the stifling atmosphere within began first to\r\nthicken, and yet ruthlessly persist in their work of indiscriminate\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nVarious curious things have from time to time been picked up from under\r\nthe bones. An islander found among them, shortly before our visit, a\r\nsewing needle of copper, little more than an inch in length; fragments\r\nof Eigg shoes, of the kind still made in the island, are of\r\ncomparatively common occurrence; and Mr. James Wilson relates, in the\r\nsingularly graphic and powerful description of _Uamh Fraingh_, which\r\noccurs in his \"Voyage round the Coasts of Scotland\" (1841), that a\r\nsailor, when he was there, disinterred, by turning up a flat stone, a\r\n\"buck-tooth\" and a piece of money,--the latter a rusty copper coin,\r\napparently of the times of Mary of Scotland. I also found a few teeth;\r\nthey were sticking fast in a fragment of jaw; and, taking it for\r\ngranted, as I suppose I may, that the dentology of the murderous M'Leods\r\noutside the cave must have very much resembled that of the murdered\r\nM'Donalds within, very harmless looking teeth they were for being those\r\nof an animal so maliciously mischievous as man. I have found in the Old\r\nRed Sandstone the strong-based tusks of the semi-reptile Holoptychius; I\r\nhave chiselled out of the limestone of the Coal Measures the sharp,\r\ndagger-like incisors of the Megalichthys; I have picked up in the Lias\r\nand Oolite the cruel spikes of the Crocodile and the Ichthyosaurus; I\r\nhave seen the trenchant, saw-edged teeth of gigantic Cestracions and\r\nSqualidae that had been disinterred from the Chalk and the London Clay;\r\nand I have felt, as I examined them, that there could be no possibility\r\nof mistake regarding the nature of the creatures to which they had\r\nbelonged;--they were teeth made for hacking, tearing, mangling,--for\r\namputating limbs at a bite, and laying open bulky bodies with a crunch;\r\nbut I could find no such evidence in the human jaw, with its three\r\ninoffensive looking grinders, that the animal it had belonged to,--far\r\nmore ruthless and cruel than reptile-fish, crocodiles, or sharks,--was\r\nof such a nature that it could destroy creatures of even its own kind by\r\nhundreds at a time, when not in the least incited by hunger, and with no\r\nultimate intention of eating them. Man must surely have become an\r\nimmensely worse animal than his teeth show him to have been designed\r\nfor; his teeth give no real evidence regarding his real character. Who,\r\nfor instance, could gather from the dentology of the M'Leods the passage\r\nin their history to which the cave of Frances bears evidence?\r\n\r\nWe quitted the cave, with its stagnant damp atmosphere and its mouldy\r\nunwholesome smells, to breathe the fresh sea-air on the beach without.\r\nIts story, as recorded by Sir Walter in his \"Tales of a Grandfather,\"\r\nand by Mr. Wilson, in his \"Voyage,\" must be familiar to the reader; and\r\nI learned from my friend, versant in all the various island traditions\r\nregarding it, that the less I inquired into its history on the spot, the\r\nmore was I likely to feel satisfied that I knew something about it.\r\nThere seem to have been no chroniclers, in this part of the Hebrides, in\r\nthe rude age of the unglazed pipkin and the copper needle; and many\r\nyears seem to have elapsed ere the story of their hapless possessors was\r\ncommitted to writing; and so we find it existing in various and somewhat\r\nconflicting editions. \"Some hundred years ago,\" says Mr. Wilson, \"a few\r\nof the M'Leods landed in Eigg from Skye, where, having greatly\r\nmisconducted themselves, the Eiggites strapped them to their own boats,\r\nwhich they sent adrift into the ocean. They were, however, rescued by\r\nsome clansmen; and, soon after, a strong body of the M'Leods set sail\r\nfrom Skye, to revenge themselves on Eigg. The natives of the latter\r\nisland feeling they were not of sufficient force to offer resistance,\r\nwent and hid themselves (men, women, and children) in this secret cave,\r\nwhich is narrow, but of great subterranean length, with an exceedingly\r\nsmall entrance. It opens from the broken face of a steep bank along the\r\nshore; and, as the whole coast is cavernous, their particular retreat\r\nwould have been sought for in vain by strangers. So the Skye-men,\r\nfinding the island uninhabited, presumed the natives had fled, and\r\nsatisfied their revengeful feelings by ransacking and pillaging the\r\nempty houses. Probably the _movables_ were of no great value. They then\r\ntook their departure and left the island, when the sight of a solitary\r\nhuman being among the cliffs awakened their suspicion, and induced them\r\nto return. Unfortunately a slight sprinkling of snow had fallen, and the\r\nfootsteps of an individual were traced to the mouth of the cave. Not\r\nhaving been there ourselves at the period alluded to, we cannot speak\r\nwith certainty as to the nature of the parley which ensued, or the\r\nterms offered by either party; but we know that those were not the days\r\nof protocols. The ultimatum was unsatisfactory to the Skye-men, who\r\nimmediately proceeded to 'adjust the preliminaries' in their own way,\r\nwhich adjustment consisted in carrying a vast collection of heather,\r\nferns, and other combustibles, and making a huge fire just in the very\r\nentrance of the _Uamh Fraingh_, which they kept up for a length of time;\r\nand thus, by 'one fell smoke,' they smothered the entire population of\r\nthe island.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is Mr. Wilson's version of the story, which, in all its leading\r\ncircumstances, agrees with that of Sir Walter. According, however, to at\r\nleast one of the Eigg versions, it was the M'Leod himself who had landed\r\non the island, driven there by a storm. The islanders, at feud with the\r\nM'Leod's at the time, inhospitably rose upon him, as he bivouacked on\r\nthe shores of the Bay of Laig; and in a fray, in which his party had the\r\nworse, his back was broken, and he was forced off half dead to sea.\r\nSeveral months after, on his partial recovery, he returned, crook-backed\r\nand infirm, to wreak his vengeance on the inhabitants, all of whom,\r\nwarned of his coming by the array of his galleys in the offing, hid\r\nthemselves in the cave, in which, however, they were ultimately\r\nbetrayed--as narrated by Sir Walter and Mr. Wilson--by the track of some\r\nfootpaths in a sprinkling of snow; and the implacable chieftain, giving\r\norders on the discovery, to unroof the houses in the neighborhood,\r\nraised high a pile of rafters against the opening, and set it on fire.\r\nAnd there he stood in front of the blaze, hump-backed and grim, till the\r\nwild, hollow cry from the rock within had sunk into silence, and there\r\nlived not a single islander of Eigg, man, woman, or child. The fact that\r\ntheir remains should have been left to moulder in the cave is proof\r\nenough, of itself, that none survived to bury the dead. I am inclined\r\nto believe, from the appearance of the place, that smoke could scarcely\r\nhave been the real agent of destruction; then, as now, it would have\r\ntaken a great deal of pure smoke to smother a Highlander. It may be\r\nperhaps deemed more probable, that the huge fire of rafter and roof-tree\r\npiled close against the opening, and rising high over it, would draw out\r\nthe oxygen within as its proper food, till at length all would be\r\nexhausted; and life would go out for want of it, like the flame of a\r\ncandle under an upturned jar. Sir Walter refers the date of the event to\r\nsome time \"about the close of the sixteenth century;\" and the coin of\r\nQueen Mary, mentioned by Mr. Wilson, points at a period at least not\r\nmuch earlier; but the exact time of its occurrence is so uncertain, that\r\na Roman Catholic priest of the Hebrides, in lately showing his people\r\nwhat a very bad thing Protestantism is, instanced, as a specimen of its\r\naverage morality, the affair of the cave. The _Protestant_ M'Leods of\r\nSkye, he said, full of hatred in their hearts, had murdered, wholesale,\r\ntheir wretched brethren, the _Protestant_ M'Donalds of Eigg, and sent\r\nthem off to perdition before their time.\r\n\r\nQuitting the beach, we ascended the breezy hill-side on our way to the\r\nScuir,--an object so often and so well described, that it might be\r\nperhaps prudent, instead of attempting one description more, to present\r\nthe reader with some of the already existing ones. \"The Scuir of Eigg,\"\r\nsays Professor Jamieson, in his 'Mineralogy of the Western Islands,' \"is\r\nperfectly mural, and extends for upwards of a mile and a half, and rises\r\nto a height of several hundred feet. It is entirely columnar, and the\r\ncolumns rise in successive ranges, until they reach the summit, where,\r\nfrom their great height, they appear, when viewed from below,\r\ndiminutive. Staffa is an object of the greatest beauty and regularity;\r\nthe pillars are as distinct as if they had been reared by the hand of\r\nart; but it has not the extent or sublimity of the Scuir of Eigg. The\r\none may be compared with the greatest exertions of human power; the\r\nother is characteristic of the wildest and most inimitable works of\r\nnature.\" \"The height of this extraordinary object is considerable,\" says\r\nM'Culloch, dashing off his sketch with a still bolder hand; \"yet its\r\npowerful effect arises rather from its peculiar form, and the commanding\r\nelevation which it occupies, than from its positive altitude. Viewed in\r\none direction, it presents a long irregular wall, crowning the summit of\r\nthe highest hill, while in the other it resembles a huge tower. Thus it\r\nforms no natural combination of outline with the surrounding land, and\r\nhence acquires that independence in the general landscape which\r\nincreases its apparent magnitude, and produces that imposing effect\r\nwhich it displays. From the peculiar position of the Scuir, it must also\r\ninevitably be viewed from a low station. Hence it everywhere towers high\r\nabove the spectator; while, like other objects on the mountain outline,\r\nits apparent dimensions are magnified, and its dark mass defined on the\r\nsky, so as to produce all the additional effects arising from strong\r\noppositions of light and shadow. The height of this rock is sufficient\r\nin this stormy country frequently to arrest the passage of the clouds,\r\nso as to be further productive of the most brilliant effects in\r\nlandscape. Often they may be seen hovering on its summit, and adding\r\nideal dimensions to the lofty face, or, when it is viewed on the\r\nextremity, conveying the impression of a tower, the height of which is\r\nsuch as to lie in the regions of the clouds. Occasionally they sweep\r\nalong the base, leaving its huge and black mass involved in additional\r\ngloom, and resembling the castle of some Arabian enchanter, built on the\r\nclouds, and suspended in air.\" It might be perhaps deemed somewhat\r\ninvidious to deal with pictures such as these in the style the\r\nconnoisseur in the \"Vicar of Wakefield\" dealt with the old painting,\r\nwhen, seizing a brush, he daubed it over with brown varnish, and then\r\nasked the spectators whether he had not greatly improved the tone of the\r\ncoloring. And yet it is just possible, that in the case of at least\r\nM'Culloch's picture, the brown varnish might do no manner of harm. But a\r\nhomelier sketch, traced out on almost the same leading lines, with just\r\na little less of the aerial in it, may have nearly the same subduing\r\neffect; I have, besides, a few curious touches to lay in, which seem\r\nhitherto to have escaped observation and the pencil; and in these\r\nseveral circumstances must lie my apology for adding one sketch more to\r\nthe sketches existing already.\r\n\r\nThe Scuir of Eigg, then, is a veritable Giant's Causeway, like that on\r\nthe coast of Antrim, taken and magnified rather more than twenty times\r\nin height, and some five or six times in breadth, and then placed on the\r\nridge of a hill nearly nine hundred feet high. Viewed sideways, it\r\nassumes, as described by M'Culloch, the form of a perpendicular but\r\nruinous rampart, much gapped above, that runs for about a mile and a\r\nquarter along the top of a lofty sloping talus. Viewed endways, it\r\nresembles a tall massy tower,--such a tower as my friend, Mr. D.O. Hill,\r\nwould delight to draw, and give delight by drawing,--a tower three\r\nhundred feet in breadth by four hundred and seventy feet in height,\r\nperched on the apex of a pyramid, like a statue on a pedestal. This\r\nstrange causeway is columnar from end to end; but the columns, from\r\ntheir great altitude and deficient breadth, seem mere rodded shafts in\r\nthe Gothic style; they rather resemble bundles of rods than\r\nwell-proportioned pillars. Few of them exceed eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter, and many of them fall short of half a foot; but, though lost\r\nin the general mass of the Scuir as independent columns, when we view it\r\nat an angle sufficiently large to take in its entire bulk, they yet\r\nimpart to it that graceful linear effect which we see brought out in\r\ntasteful pencil sketches and good line engravings. We approached it this\r\nday from the shore in the direction in which the eminence it stands upon\r\nassumes the pyramidal form, and itself the tower-like outline. The\r\nacclivity is barren and stony,--a true desert foreground, like those of\r\nThebes and Palmyra; and the huge square shadow of the tower stretched\r\ndark and cold athwart it. The sun shone out clearly. One half the\r\nimmense bulk before us, with its delicate vertical lining, lay from top\r\nto bottom in deep shade, massive and gray; one half presented its\r\nmany-sided columns to the light, here and there gleaming with tints of\r\nextreme brightness, where the pitchstones presented their glassy planes\r\nto the sun; its general outline, whether pencilled by the lighter or\r\ndarker tints, stood out sharp and clear; and a stratum of white fleecy\r\nclouds floated slowly amid the delicious blue behind it. But the minuter\r\ndetails I must reserve for my next chapter. One fact, however,\r\nanticipated just a little out of its order, may heighten the interest of\r\nthe reader. There are massive buildings,--bridges of noble span, and\r\nharbors that abut far into the waves,--founded on wooden piles; and this\r\nhugest of hill-forts we find founded on wooden piles also. It is built\r\non what a Scotch architect would perhaps term a pile-_brander_ of the\r\n_Pinites Eiggensis_, an ancient tree of the Oolite. The gigantic Scuir\r\nof Eigg rests on the remains of a prostrate forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     Structure of the Scuir--A stray Column--The Piazza--A buried Pine\r\n     Forest the Foundation of the Scuir--Geological Poachers in a Fossil\r\n     Preserve--_Pinites Eiggensis_--Its Description--Witham's\r\n     Experiments on Fossil Pine of Eigg--Rings of the Pine--Ascent of\r\n     the Scuir--Appearance of the Top--White Pitchstone--Mr. Greig's\r\n     Discovery of Pumice--A Sunset Scene--The Manse and the Yacht--The\r\n     Minister's Story--A Cottage Repast--American Timber drifted to the\r\n     Hebrides--Agency of the Gulf Stream--The Minister's Sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we climbed the hill-side, and the Shinar-like tower before us rose\r\nhigher over the horizon at each step we took, till it seemed pointing at\r\nthe middle sky, we could mark peculiarities in its structure which\r\nescape notice in the distance. We found it composed of various beds,\r\neach of which would make a Giant's Causeway entire, piled over each\r\nother like stories in a building, and divided into columns, vertical, or\r\nnearly so, in every instance except in one bed near the base, in which\r\nthe pillars incline to a side, as if losing footing under the\r\nsuperincumbent weight. Innumerable polygonal fragments,--single stones\r\nof the building,--lie scattered over the slope, composed, like almost\r\nall the rest of the Scuir, of a peculiar and very beautiful stone,\r\nunlike any other in Scotland--a dark pitchstone-porphyry, which,\r\ninclosing crystals of glassy feldspar, resembles in the hand-specimen, a\r\nmass of black sealing-wax, with numerous pieces of white bugle stuck\r\ninto it. Some of the detached polygons are of considerable size; few of\r\nthem larger and bulkier, however, than a piece of column of this\r\ncharacteristic porphyry, about ten feet in length by two feet in\r\ndiameter, which lies a full mile away from any of the others, in the\r\nline of the old burying-ground, and distant from it only a few hundred\r\nyards. It seems to have been carried there by man: we find its bearing\r\nfrom the Scuir lying nearly at right angles with the direction of the\r\ndrift-boulders of the western coast, which are, besides, of rare\r\noccurrence in the Hebrides; nor has it a single neighbor; and it seems\r\nnot improbable, as a tradition of the island testifies, that it was\r\nremoved thus far for the purpose of marking some place of sepulture, and\r\nthat the catastrophe of the cave arrested its progress after by far the\r\nlonger and rougher portion of the way had been passed. The dry-arm bones\r\nof the charnel-house in the rock may have been tugging around it when\r\nthe galleys of the M'Leod hove in sight. The traditional history of\r\nEigg, said my friend the minister, compared with that of some of the\r\nneighboring islands, presents a decapitated aspect: the M'Leods cut it\r\noff by the neck. Most of the present inhabitants can tell which of their\r\nancestors, grandfather, or great-grandfather, or great-great-grandfather,\r\nfirst settled in the place, and where they came from; and, with the\r\nexception of a few vague legends about St. Donan and his grave, which were\r\npreserved apparently among the people of the other Small Isles, the island\r\nhas no early traditional history.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached the Scuir. There occur, intercalated with the\r\ncolumnar beds, a few bands of a buff-colored non-columnar trap,\r\ndescribed by M'Culloch as of a texture intermediate between a greenstone\r\nand a basalt, and which, while the pitchstone around it seems nearly\r\nindestructible, has weathered so freely as to form horizontal grooves\r\nalong the face of the rock, from two to five yards in depth. One of\r\nthese runs for several hundred feet along the base of the Scuir, just at\r\nthe top of the talus, and greatly resembles a piazza, lacking the outer\r\npillars. It is from ten to twelve feet in height, by from fifteen to\r\ntwenty in depth; the columns of the pitch stone-bed immediately above\r\nit seem perilously hanging in mid air; and along their sides there\r\ntrickles, in even the driest summer weather,--for the Scuir is a\r\ncondenser on an immense scale--minute runnels of water, that patter\r\nceaselessly in front of the long deep hollow, like rain from the eaves\r\nof a cottage during a thunder shower. Inside, however, all is dry, and\r\nthe floor is covered to the depth of several inches with the dung of\r\nsheep and cattle, that find, in this singular mountain piazza, a place\r\nof shelter. We had brought a pickaxe with us; and the dry and dusty\r\nfloor, composed mainly of a gritty conglomerate, formed the scene of our\r\nlabors. It is richly fossiliferous, though the organisms have no\r\nspecific variety; and never, certainly, have I found the remains of\r\nformer creations in a scene in which they more powerfully addressed\r\nthemselves to the imagination. A stratum of peat-moss, mixed with\r\nfresh-water shells, and resting on a layer of vegetable mould, from\r\nwhich the stumps and roots of trees still protruded, was once found in\r\nItaly, buried beneath an ancient tesselated pavement; and the whole gave\r\ncurious evidence of a kind fitted to picture to the imagination a\r\nbackground vista of antiquity, all the more remotely ancient in aspect\r\nfrom the venerable age of the object in front. Dry ground covered by\r\nwood, a lake, a morass, and then dry ground again, had all taken\r\nprecedence, on the site of the tesselated pavement, in this instance, of\r\nan old Roman villa. But what was antiquity in connection with a Roman\r\nvilla, to antiquity in connection with the Scuir of Eigg? Under the old\r\nfoundations of this huge wall we find the remains of a pine forest,\r\nthat, long ere a single bed of the porphyry had burst from beneath, had\r\nsprung up and decayed on hill and beside stream in some nameless\r\nland,--had then been swept to the sea,--had been entombed deep at the\r\nbottom in a grit of Oolite,--had been heaved up to the surface, and\r\nhigh over it, by volcanic agencies working from beneath,--and had\r\nfinally been built upon, as moles are built upon piles, by the architect\r\nthat had laid down the masonry of the gigantic Scuir, in one fiery layer\r\nafter another. The mountain wall of Eigg, with its dizzy elevation of\r\nfour hundred and seventy feet, is a wall founded on piles of pine laid\r\ncrossways; and, strange as the fact may seem, one has but to dig into\r\nthe floor of this deep-hewn piazza, to be convinced that at least it\r\n_is_ a fact.\r\n\r\nJust at this interesting stage, however, our explorations bade fair to\r\nbe interrupted. Our man who carried the pickaxe had lingered behind us\r\nfor a few hundred yards, in earnest conversation with an islander; and\r\nhe now came up, breathless and in hot haste, to say that the islander, a\r\nRoman Catholic tacksman in the neighborhood, had peremptorily warned him\r\nthat the Scuir of Eigg was the property of Dr. M'Pherson of Aberdeen,\r\nnot ours, and that the Doctor would be very angry at any man who meddled\r\nwith it. \"That message,\" said my friend, laughing, but looking just a\r\nlittle sad through the laugh, \"would scarce have been sent us when I was\r\nminister of the Establishment here; but it seems allowable in the case\r\nof a poor Dissenter, and is no bad specimen of the thousand little ways\r\nin which the Roman Catholic population of the island try to annoy me,\r\nnow that they see my back to the wall.\" I was tickled with the idea of a\r\nfossil preserve, which coupled itself in my mind, through a trick of the\r\nassociative faculty, with the idea of a great fossil act for the\r\nBritish empire, framed on the principles of the game-laws; and, just\r\nwondering what sort of disreputable vagabonds geological poachers\r\nwould become under its deteriorating influence, I laid hold of the\r\npickaxe and broke into the stonefast floor; and thence I succeeded in\r\nabstracting,--feloniously, I dare say, though the crime has not yet got\r\ninto the statute-book--some six or eight pieces of the _Pinites\r\nEiggensis_, amounting in all to about half a cubic foot of that very\r\nancient wood--value unknown. I trust, should the case come to a serious\r\nbearing, the members of the London Geological Society will generously\r\nsubscribe half-a-crown a-piece to assist me in feeing counsel. There are\r\nmore interests than mine at stake in the affair. If I be cast and\r\ncommitted,--I, who have poached over only a few miserable districts in\r\nScotland,--pray, what will become of some of them,--the Lyells,\r\nBucklands, Murchisons and Sedgwicks,--who have poached over whole\r\ncontinents?\r\n\r\nWe were successful in procuring several good specimens of the Eigg pine,\r\nat a depth, in the conglomerate, of from eight to eighteen inches. Some\r\nof the upper pieces we found in contact with the decomposing trap out of\r\nwhich the hollow piazza above had been scooped; but the greater number,\r\nas my set of specimens abundantly testify, lay embedded in the original\r\nOolitic grit in which they had been locked up, in, I doubt not, their\r\npresent fossil state, ere their upheaval, through Plutonic agency, from\r\ntheir deep-sea bottom. The annual rings of the wood, which are quite as\r\nsmall as in a slow-growing Baltic pine, are distinctly visible in all\r\nthe better pieces I this day transferred to my bag. In one fragment I\r\nreckon sixteen rings in half an inch, and fifteen in the same space in\r\nanother. The trees to which they belonged seem to have grown on some\r\nexposed hill-side, where, in the course of half a century, little more\r\nthan from two or three inches were added to their diameter. The _Pinites\r\nEiggensis_, or Eigg pine, was first introduced to the notice of the\r\nscientific world by the late Mr. Witham, in whose interesting work on\r\n\"The Internal Structure of Fossil Vegetables\" the reader may find it\r\nfigured and described. The specimen in which he studied its\r\npeculiarities \"was found,\" he says, \"at the base of the magnificent\r\nmural escarpment named the Scuir of Eigg,--not, however, _in situ_, but\r\namong fragments of rocks of the Oolitic series.\" The authors of the\r\n\"Fossil Flora,\" where it is also figured, describe it as differing very\r\nconsiderably in structure from any of the coniferae of the Coal Measures.\r\n\"Its medullary rays,\" says Messrs. Lindley and Hutton, \"appear to be\r\nmore numerous, and frequently are not continued through one zone of wood\r\nto another, but more generally terminate at the concentric circles. It\r\nabounds also in turpentine vessels, or lacunae, of various sizes, the\r\nsides of which are distinctly defined.\" Viewed through the microscope,\r\nin transparent slips, longitudinal and transverse, it presents, within\r\nthe space of a few lines, objects fitted to fill the mind with wonder.\r\nWe find the minutest cells, glands, fibres, of the original wood\r\npreserved uninjured. _There_ still are those medullary rays entire that\r\ncommunicated between the pith and the outside,--_there_ still the ring\r\nof thickened cells that indicated the yearly check which the growth\r\nreceived when winter came on,--_there_ the polygonal reticulations of\r\nthe cross section, without a single broken mesh,--_there_, too, the\r\nelongated cells in the longitudinal one, each filled with minute glands\r\nthat take the form of double circles,--_there_ also, of larger size and\r\nless regular form, the lacunae in which the turpentine lay: every nicely\r\norganized speck, invisible to the naked eye, we find in as perfect a\r\nstate of keeping in the incalculably ancient pile-work on which the\r\ngigantic Scuir is founded, as in the living pines that flourish green on\r\nour hill-sides. A net-work, compared with which that of the finest lace\r\never worn by the fair reader would seem a net-work of cable, has\r\npreserved entire, for untold ages, the most delicate peculiarities of\r\nits pattern. There is not a mesh broken, nor a circular dot away!\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Mr. Witham on the Eigg fossil, furnish an\r\ninteresting example of the light which a single, apparently simple,\r\ndiscovery may throw on whole departments of fact. He sliced his specimen\r\nlongitudinally and across, fastened the slices on glass, ground them\r\ndown till they became semi-transparent, and then, examining them under\r\nreflected light by the microscope, marked and recorded the specific\r\npeculiarities of their structure. And we now know, in consequence, that\r\nthe ancient Eigg pine, to which the detached fragment picked up at the\r\nbase of the Scuir belonged,--a pine alike different from those of the\r\nearlier carboniferous period and those which exist contemporary with\r\nourselves,--was, some _three creations_ ago, an exceedingly common tree\r\nin the country now called Scotland,--as much so, perhaps, as the Scotch\r\nfir is at the present day. The fossil trees found in such abundance in\r\nthe neighborhood of Helmsdale that they are burnt for lime,--the fossil\r\nwood of Eathie, in Cromartyshire, and that of Shandwick, in Ross,--all\r\nbelong to the _Pinites Eiggensis_. It seems to have been a straight and\r\nstately tree, in most instances, as in the Eigg specimens, of slow\r\ngrowth. One of the trunks I saw near Navidale measured two feet in\r\ndiameter, but a full century had passed ere it attained to a bulk so\r\nconsiderable; and a splendid specimen in my collection, from the same\r\nlocality, which measures twenty-one inches, exhibits even _more_ than a\r\nhundred annual rings. In one of my specimens, and one only, the rings\r\nare of great breadth. They differ from those of all the others in the\r\nproportion in which I have seen the annual rings of a young, vigorous\r\nfir that had sprung up in some rich, moist hollow, differ from the\r\nannual rings of trees of the same species that had grown in the shallow,\r\nhard soil of exposed hill-sides. And this one specimen furnishes curious\r\nevidence that the often-marked but little understood law, which gives us\r\nour better and worse seasons in alternate groups, various in number and\r\nuncertain in their time of recurrence, obtained as early as the age of\r\nthe Oolite. The rings follow each other in groups of lesser and larger\r\nbreadth. One group of four rings measures an inch and a quarter across,\r\nwhile an adjoining group of five rings measures only five-eighth parts;\r\nand in a breadth of six inches there occur five of these alternate\r\ngroups. For some four or five years together, when this pine was a\r\nliving tree, the springs were late and cold, and the summers cloudy and\r\nchill, as in that group of seasons which intervened between 1835 and\r\n1841; and then, for four or five years, more springs were early and\r\nsummers genial, as in the after group of 1842, 1843 and 1844. An\r\narrangement in nature,--first observed, as we learn from Bacon, by the\r\npeople of the Low Countries, and which has since formed the basis of\r\nmeteoric tables, and of predictions and elaborate cycles of the\r\nweather,--bound together the twelvemonths of the Oolitic period in\r\nalternate bundles of better and worse: vegetation throve vigorously\r\nduring the summers of one group, and languished, in those of another, in\r\na state of partial development.\r\n\r\nSending away our man shipwards, laden with a bag of fossil wood, we\r\nascended by a steep broken ravine to the top of the Scuir. The columns,\r\nas we pass on towards the west, diminish in size, and assume in many of\r\nthe beds considerable variety of direction and form. In one bed they\r\nbelly over with a curve, like the ribs of some wrecked vessel from which\r\nthe planking has been torn away; in another they project in a straight\r\nline, like muskets planted slantways on the ground to receive a charge\r\nof cavalry; in others the inclination is inwards, like that of ranges of\r\nstakes placed in front of a sea-dyke, to break the violence of the\r\nwaves; while yet in others they present, as in the eastern portion of\r\nthe Scuir, the common vertical direction. The ribbed appearance of every\r\ncrag and cliff, imparts to the scene a peculiar character; every larger\r\nmass of light and shadow is corded with minute stripes; and the feeling\r\nexperienced among the more shattered peaks, and in the more broken\r\nrecesses, seems near akin to that which it is the tendency of some\r\nmagnificent ruin to excite, than that which awakens amid the sublime of\r\nnature. We feel as if the pillared rocks around us were like the\r\nCyclopean walls of Southern Italy,--the erections of some old gigantic\r\nrace passed from the earth forever. The feeling must have been\r\nexperienced on former occasions, amid the innumerable pillars of the\r\nScuir; for we find M'Culloch, in his description, ingeniously analyzing\r\nit. \"The resemblance to architecture here is much increased,\" he says,\r\n\"by the columnar structure, which is sufficiently distinguishable, even\r\nfrom a distance, and produces a strong effect of artificial regularity\r\nwhen seen near at hand. To this vague association in the mind of the\r\nefforts of art with the magnitude of nature, is owing much of that\r\nsublimity of character which the Scuir presents. The sense of power is a\r\nfertile source of the sublime; and as the appearance of power exerted,\r\nno less than that of simplicity, is necessary to confer this character\r\non architecture, so the mind, insensibly transferring the operations of\r\nnature to the efforts of art where they approximate in character,\r\nbecomes impressed with a feeling rarely excited by her more ordinary\r\nforms, where these are even more stupendous.\"\r\n\r\nThe top of the Scuir, more especially towards its eastern termination,\r\nresembles that of some vast mole not yet levelled over by the workmen;\r\nthe pavement has not yet been laid down, and there are deep gaps in the\r\nmasonry, that run transversely, from side to side, still to fill up.\r\nAlong one of these ditch-like gaps, which serves to insulate the eastern\r\nand highest portion of the Scuir from all its other portions, we find\r\nfragments of a rude wall of uncemented stones, the remains of an\r\nancient hill-fort; which, with its natural rampart of rock on three of\r\nits four sides, more than a hundred yards in sheer descent, and with its\r\ndeep ditch and rude wall on the fourth, must have formed one of the most\r\ninaccessible in the kingdom. The masses of pitchstone a-top, though so\r\nintensely black within, are weathered on the surface into almost a pure\r\nwhite; and we found lying detached among them, fragments of common\r\namygdaloid and basalt, and minute slaty pieces of chalcedony that had\r\nformed apparently in fissures of the trap. We would have scrutinized\r\nmore narrowly at the time had we expected to find anything more rare;\r\nbut I did not know until full four months after, that aught more rare\r\nwas to be found. Had we examined somewhat more carefully, we might\r\npossibly have done what Mr. Woronzow Greig did on the Scuir about\r\neighteen years previous,--picked up on it a piece of _bona fide_ Scotch\r\npumice. This gentleman, well known through his exertions in statistical\r\nscience, and for his love of science in general, and whose tastes and\r\nacquirements are not unworthy the son of Mrs. Somerville, has kindly\r\ninformed me by letter regarding his curious discovery. \"I visited the\r\nisland of Eigg,\" he says, \"in 1825 or 1826, for the purpose of shooting,\r\nand remained in it several days; and as there was a great scarcity of\r\ngame, I amused myself in my wanderings by looking about for natural\r\ncuriosities. I knew little about Geology at the time, but, collecting\r\nwhatever struck my eye as uncommon, I picked up from the sides of the\r\nScuir, among various other things, a bit of fossil wood, and, nearly at\r\nthe summit of the eminence, a piece of pumice of a deep brownish-black\r\ncolor, and very porous, the pores being large and round, and the\r\nsubstance which divided them of a uniform thickness. This last specimen\r\nI gave to Mr. Lyell, who said that it could not originally have belonged\r\nto Eigg, though it might possibly have been washed there by the sea,--a\r\nsuggestion, however, with which its place on the top of the Scuir seems\r\nill to accord. I may add, that I have since procured a larger specimen\r\nfrom the same place.\" This seems a curious fact, when we take into\r\naccount the identity, in their mineral components, of the pumice and\r\nobsidian of the recent volcanoes; and that pitchstone, the obsidian of\r\nthe trap-rocks, is resolvable into a pumice by the art of the chemist.\r\nIf pumice was to be found anywhere in Scotland, we might _a priori_\r\nexpect to find it in connection with by far the largest mass of\r\npitchstone in the kingdom. It is just possible, however, that Mr.\r\nGreig's two specimens may not date farther back, in at least their\r\nexisting state, than the days of the hill-fort. Powerful fires would\r\nhave been required to render the exposed summit of the Scuir at all\r\ncomfortable; there is a deep peat-moss in its immediate neighborhood,\r\nthat would have furnished the necessary fuel; the wind must have been\r\nsufficiently high on the summit to fan the embers into an intense white\r\nheat; and if it was heat but half as intense as that which was employed\r\nin fusing into one mass the thick vitrified ramparts of Craig Phadrig\r\nand Knock Farril, on the east coast, it could scarce have failed to\r\nanticipate the experiment of the Hon. Mr. Knox, of Dublin, by converting\r\nsome of the numerous pitchstone fragments that lie scattered about,\r\n\"into a light substance in every respect resembling pumice.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now evening, and rarely have I witnessed a finer. The sun had\r\ndeclined half-way adown the western sky, and for many yards the shadow\r\nof the gigantic Scuir lay dark beneath us along the descending slope.\r\nAll the rest of the island, spread out at our feet as in a map, was\r\nbasking in yellow sunshine; and with its one dark shadow thrown from its\r\none mountain-elevated wall of rock, it seemed some immense fantastical\r\ndial, with its gnomon rising tall in the midst. Far below, perched on\r\nthe apex of the shadow, and half lost in the line of the penumbra, we\r\ncould see two indistinct specks of black, with a dim halo around\r\neach,--specks that elongated as we arose, and contracted as we sat, and\r\nwent gliding along the line as we walked. The shadows of two gnats\r\ndisporting on the edge of an ordinary gnomon would have seemed vastly\r\nmore important, in proportion, on the figured plane of the dial, than\r\nthese, our ghostly representatives, did here. The sea, spangled in the\r\nwake of the sun with quick glancing light, stretched out its blue plain\r\naround us; and we could see included in the wide prospect, on the one\r\nhand, at once the hill-chains of Morven and Kintail, with the many\r\nintervening lochs and bold jutting headlands that give variety to the\r\nmainland; and, on the other, the variously complexioned Hebrides, from\r\nthe Isle of Skye to Uist and Barra, and from Uist and Barra to Tiree and\r\nMull. The contiguous Small Isles, Muck and Rum, lay moored immediately\r\nbeside us, like vessels of the same convoy that in some secure roadstead\r\ndrop anchor within hail of each other. I could willingly have lingered\r\non the top of the Scuir until after sunset; but the minister, who, ever\r\nand anon, during the day, had been conning over some notes jotted on a\r\npaper of wonderfully scant dimensions, reminded me that this was the\r\nevening of his week-day discourse, and that we were more than a\r\nparticularly rough mile from the place of meeting, and within, half an\r\nhour of the time. I took one last look of the scene ere we commenced our\r\ndescent. There, in the middle of the ample parish glebe, that looked\r\nricher and greener in the light of the declining sun than at any former\r\nperiod during the day,--rose the snug parish manse; and yonder,--in an\r\nopen island channel, with a strip of dark rocks fringing the land\r\nwithin, and another dark strip fringing the barren Eilean Chaisteil\r\noutside,--lay the Betsey, looking wonderfully diminutive, but evidently\r\na little thing of high spirit, taut-masted, with a smart rake aft, and a\r\nspruce outrigger astern, and flaunting her triangular flag of blue in\r\nthe sun. I pointed first to the manse, and then to the yacht. The\r\nminister shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a time of strange changes,\" he said; \"I thought to have lived and\r\ndied in that house, and found a quiet grave in the burying-ground yonder\r\nbeside the ruin; but my path was a clear though a rugged one; and from\r\nalmost the moment that it opened up to me, I saw what I had to expect.\r\nIt has been said that I might have lain by here in this out-of-the-way\r\ncorner, and suffered the Church question to run its course, without\r\nquitting my hold of the Establishment. And so I perhaps might. It is\r\neasy securing one's own safety, in even the worst of times, if one look\r\nno higher; and I, as I had no opportunity of mixing in the contest, or\r\nof declaring my views respecting it, might be regarded as an unpledged\r\nman. But the principles of the Evangelical party were my principles; and\r\nit would have been consistent with neither honor nor religion to have\r\nhung back in the day of battle, and suffered the men with whom in heart\r\nI was at one to pay the whole forfeit of our common quarrel. So I\r\nattended the Convocation, and pledged myself to stand or fall with my\r\nbrethren. On my return I called my people together, and told them how\r\nthe case stood, and that in May next I bade fair to be a dependent for a\r\nhome on the proprietor of Eigg. And so they petitioned the proprietor\r\nthat he might give me leave to build a house among them,--exactly the\r\nsame sort of favor granted to the Roman Catholics of the island. But\r\nmonth after month passed, and they got no reply to their petition; and I\r\nwas left in suspense, not knowing whether I was to have a home among\r\nthem or no. I did feel the case a somewhat hard one. The father of Dr.\r\nM'Pherson of Eigg had been, like myself, a humble Scotch minister; and\r\nthe Doctor, however indifferent to his people's wishes in such a matter,\r\nmight have just thought that a man in his father's station in life, with\r\na wife and family dependent on him, was placed by his silence in cruel\r\ncircumstances of uncertainty. Ere the Disruption took place, however, I\r\ncame to know pretty conclusively what I had to expect. The Doctor's\r\nfactor came to Eigg, and, as I was informed, told the Islanders that it\r\nwas not likely the Doctor would permit a _third_ place of worship on the\r\nIsland: the Roman Catholics had one, and the Establishment had a kind of\r\none, and there was to be no more. The factor, an active\r\nmessenger-at-arms, useful in raising rents in these parts, has always\r\nbeen understood to speak the mind of his master; but the congregation\r\ntook heart in the emergency, and sent off a second petition to Dr.\r\nM'Pherson, a week or so previous to the Disruption. Ere _it_ received an\r\nanswer, the Disruption took place; and, laying the whole circumstances\r\nbefore my brethren in Edinburgh, who, like myself, interpreted the\r\nsilence of the Doctor into a refusal, I suggested to them the scheme of\r\nthe Betsey, as the only scheme through which I could keep up unbroken my\r\nconnection with my people. So the trial is now over, and here we are,\r\nand yonder is the Betsey.\"\r\n\r\nWe descended the Scuir together for the place of meeting, and entered,\r\nby the way, the cottage of a worthy islander, much attached to his\r\nminister. \"We are both very hungry,\" said my friend: \"we have been out\r\namong the rocks since breakfast-time, and are wonderfully disposed to\r\neat. Do not put yourself about, but give us anything you have at hand.\"\r\nThere was a bowl of rich milk brought us, and a splendid platter of\r\nmashed potatoes, and we dined like princes. I observed, for the first\r\ntime, in the interior of this cottage, what I had frequent occasion to\r\nremark afterwards, that much of the wood used in building in the smaller\r\nand outer islands of the Hebrides must have drifted across the Atlantic,\r\nborne eastwards and northwards by the great Gulf-stream. Many of the\r\nbeams and boards, sorely drilled by the _Teredo navalis_, are of\r\nAmerican timber, that, from time to time, has been cast upon the\r\nshore,--a portion of it, apparently, from timber-laden vessels\r\nunfortunate in their voyage, but a portion of it, also, with root and\r\nbranch still attached, bearing mark of having been swept to the sea by\r\ntransatlantic rivers. Nuts and seeds of tropical plants are occasionally\r\npicked up on the beach. My friend gave me a bean or nut of the _Dolichos\r\nurens_, or cow-itch shrub, of the West Indies, which an islander had\r\nfound on the shore sometime in the previous year, and given to one of\r\nthe manse children as a toy; and I attach some little interest to it, as\r\na curiosity of the same class with the large canes and the fragment of\r\ncarved wood found floating near the shores of Madeira by the\r\nbrother-in-law of Columbus, and which, among other pieces of\r\ncircumstantial evidence, led the great navigator to infer the existence\r\nof a western continent. Curiosities of this kind seem still more common\r\nin the northern than in the western islands of Scotland. \"Large exotic\r\nnuts or seeds,\" says Dr. Patrick Neill, in his interesting \"Tour,\"\r\nquoted in a former chapter, \"which in Orkney are known by the name of\r\nMolucca beans, are occasionally found among the _rejectamenta_ of the\r\nsea, especially after westerly winds. There are two kinds commonly\r\nfound: the larger (of which the fishermen very generally make\r\nsnuff-boxes) seem to be seeds from the great pod of the _Mimosa\r\nscandens_ of the West Indies; the smaller seeds, from the pod of the\r\n_Dolichos urens_, also a native of the same region. It is probable that\r\nthe currents of the ocean, and particularly that great current which\r\nissues from the Gulf of Florida, and is hence denominated the Gulf\r\nStream, aid very much in transporting across the mighty Atlantic these\r\nAmerican products. They are generally quite fresh and entire, and afford\r\nan additional proof how impervious to moisture, and how imperishable,\r\nnuts and seeds generally are.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening was fast falling ere the minister closed his discourse; and\r\nwe had but just light enough left, on reaching the Betsey, to show us\r\nthat there lay a dead sheep on the deck. It had been sent aboard to be\r\nkilled by the minister's factotum, John Stewart; but John was at the\r\nevening preaching at the time, and the poor sheep, in its attempts to\r\nset itself free, had got itself entangled among the cords, and strangled\r\nitself. \"Alas, alas!\" exclaimed the minister, \"thus ends our hope of\r\nfresh mutton for the present, and my hapless speculation as a sheep\r\nfarmer for evermore.\" I learned from him, afterwards, over our tea, that\r\nshortly previous to the Convocation he had got his glebe,--one of the\r\nlargest in Scotland,--well stocked with sheep and cattle, which he had\r\nto sell, immediately on the Disruption, in miserably bad condition, at a\r\nloss of nearly fifty per cent. He had a few sheep, however, that would\r\nnot sell at all, and that remained on the glebe, in consequence, until\r\nhis successor entered into possession. And he, honest man, straightway\r\nimpounded them, and got them incarcerated in a dark, dirty hole,\r\nsomewhat in the way Giant Despair incarcerated the pilgrims,--a thing he\r\nhad quite a legal right to do, seeing that the mile-long glebe, with its\r\nmany acres of luxuriant pasture, was now as much his property as it had\r\nbeen Mr. Swanson's a few months before, and seeing Mr. Swanson's few\r\nsheep had no right to crop his grass. But a worthy neighbor\r\ninterfered,--Mr. M'Donald, of Keil, the principal tenant in the island.\r\nMr. M'Donald,--a practical commentator on the law of kindness,--was\r\nsorely scandalized at what he deemed the new minister's gratuitous\r\nunkindness to a brother in calamity; and, relieving the sheep, he\r\nbrought them to his own farm, where he found them board and lodging on\r\nmy friend's behalf, till they could be used up at leisure. And it was\r\none of the last of this unfortunate lot that now contrived to escape\r\nfrom us by anticipating John Stewart. \"A black beginning makes a black\r\nending,\" said Gouffing Jock, an ancient border shepherd, when his only\r\nsheep, a black ewe, the sole survivor of a flock smothered in a\r\nsnow-storm, was worried to death by his dogs. Then, taking down his\r\nbroadsword, he added, \"Come awa, my auld friend; thou and I maun e'en\r\nstock Bowerhope-Law ance mair!\" Less warlike than Gouffing Jock, we were\r\ncontent to repeat over the dead, on this occasion, simply the first\r\nportion of his speech; and then, betaking ourselves to our cabin, we\r\nforgot all our sorrows over our tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     An Excursion--The Chain of Crosses--Bay of Laig--Island of\r\n     Rum--Description of the Island--Superstitions banished by pure\r\n     Religion--Fossil Shells--Remarkable Oyster Bed--New species of\r\n     Belemnite--Oolitic Shells--White Sandstone Precipices--Gigantic\r\n     Petrified Mushrooms--\"Christabel\" in Stone--Musical Sand--_Jabel\r\n     Nakous_, or Mountain of the Bell--Experiments of Travellers at\r\n     _Jabel Nakous_--Welsted's Account--_Reg-Rawan_, or the Moving\r\n     Sand--The Musical Sounds inexplicable--Article on the subject in\r\n     the North British Review.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been rain during the night; and when I first got on deck, a\r\nlittle after seven, a low stratum of mist, that completely enveloped the\r\nScuir, and truncated both the eminence on which it stands and the\r\nopposite height, stretched like a ruler across the flat valley which\r\nindents so deeply the middle of the island. But the fogs melted away as\r\nthe morning rose, and ere our breakfast was satisfactorily discussed,\r\nthe last thin wreath had disappeared from around the columned front of\r\nthe rock-tower of Eigg, and a powerful sun looked down on moist slopes\r\nand dank hollows, from which there arose in the calm a hazy vapor, that,\r\nwhile it softened the lower features of the landscape, left the bold\r\noutline relieved against a clear sky. Accompanied by our attendant of\r\nthe previous day, bearing bag and hammer, we set out a little before\r\neleven for the north-western side of the island, by a road which winds\r\nalong the central hollow. My friend showed me as we went, that on the\r\nedge of an eminence, on which the traveller journeying westwards catches\r\nthe last glimpse of the chapel of St. Donan, there had once been a rude\r\ncross erected, and another rude cross on an eminence on which he catches\r\nthe last glimpse of the first; and that there had thus been a chain of\r\nstations formed from sea to sea, like the sights of a land-surveyor,\r\nfrom one of which a second could be seen, and a third from the second,\r\ntill, last of all, the emphatically holy point of the island,--the\r\nburial-place of the old Culdee,--came full in view. The unsteady\r\ndevotion, that journeyed, fancy-bound, along the heights, to gloat over\r\na dead man's bones, had its clue to carry it on in a straight line. Its\r\ntrail was on the ground; it glided snake-like from cross to cross, in\r\nquest of dust; and, without its finger-posts to guide it, would have\r\nwandered devious. It is surely a better devotion that, instead of thus\r\ncreeping over the earth to a mouldy sepulchre, can at once launch into\r\nthe sky, secure of finding Him who once arose from one. In less than an\r\nhour we were descending on the Bay of Laig, a semi-circular indentation\r\nof the coast, about a mile in length, and, where it opens to the main\r\nsea, nearly two miles in breadth; with the noble island of Rum rising\r\nhigh in front, like some vast breakwater; and a meniscus of\r\ncomparatively level land, walled in behind by a semi-circular rampart of\r\ncontinuous precipice, sweeping round its shores. There are few finer\r\nscenes in the Hebrides than that furnished by this island bay and its\r\npicturesque accompaniments,--none that break more unexpectedly on the\r\ntraveller who descends upon it from the east; and rarely has it been\r\nseen, to greater advantage than on the delicate day, so soft, and yet so\r\nsunshiny and clear, on which I paid it my first visit.\r\n\r\nThe island of Rum, with its abrupt sea-wall of rock, and its\r\nsteep-pointed hills, that attain, immediately over the sea, an elevation\r\nof more than two thousand feet, loomed bold and high in the offing, some\r\nfive miles away, but apparently much nearer. The four tall summits of\r\nthe island rose clear against the sky like a group of pyramids; its\r\nlower slopes and precipices, variegated and relieved by graceful\r\nalternations of light and shadow, and resting on their blue basement of\r\nsea, stood out with equal distinctness; but the entire middle space from\r\nend to end was hidden in a long horizontal stratum of gray cloud, edged\r\natop with a lacing of silver. Such was the aspect of the noble\r\nbreakwater in front. Fully two-thirds of the semi-circular rampart of\r\nrock which shuts in the crescent-shaped plain directly opposite lay in\r\ndeep shadow; but the sun shone softly on the plain itself, brightening\r\nup many a dingy cottage, and many a green patch of corn; and the bay\r\nbelow stretched out, sparkling in the light. There is no part of the\r\nisland so thickly inhabited as this flat meniscus. It is composed almost\r\nentirely of Oolitic rocks, and bears atop, especially where an ancient\r\noyster-bed of great depth forms the subsoil, a kindly and fertile mould.\r\nThe cottages lie in groups; and, save where a few bogs, which it would\r\nbe no very difficult matter to drain, interpose their rough shag of dark\r\ngreen, and break the continuity, the plain around them waves with corn.\r\nLying fair, green and populous within the sweep of its inaccessible\r\nrampart of rock, at least twice as lofty as the ramparts of Babylon of\r\nold, it reminds one of the suburbs of some ancient city lying embosomed,\r\nwith all its dwellings and fields, within some roomy crescent of the\r\ncity wall. We passed, ere we entered on the level, a steep-sided narrow\r\ndell, through which a small stream finds its way from the higher\r\ngrounds, and which terminates at the upper end in an abrupt precipice,\r\nand a lofty but very slim cascade. \"One of the few superstitions that\r\nstill linger on the island,\" said my friend the minister, \"is associated\r\nwith that wild hollow. It is believed that shortly before a death takes\r\nplace among the inhabitants, a tall withered female may be seen in the\r\ntwilight, just yonder where the rocks open, washing a shroud in the\r\nstream. John, there, will perhaps tell you how she was spoken to on one\r\noccasion, by an over-bold, over-inquisitive islander, curious to know\r\nwhose shroud she was preparing; and how she more than satisfied his\r\ncuriosity, by telling him it was his own. It is a not uninteresting\r\nfact,\" added the minister, \"that my poor people, since they have become\r\nmore earnest about their religion, think very little about ghosts and\r\nspectres: their faith in the realities of the unseen world seems to have\r\nbanished from their minds much of their old belief in its phantoms.\"\r\n\r\nIn the rude fences that separate from each other the little farms in\r\nthis plain, we find frequent fragments of the oyster bed, hardened into\r\na tolerably compact limestone. It is seen to most advantage, however, in\r\nsome of the deeper cuttings in the fields, where the surrounding matrix\r\nexists merely as an incoherent shale; and the shells may be picked out\r\nas entire as when they lay, ages before, in the mud, which we still see\r\nretaining around them its original color. They are small, thin,\r\ntriangular, much resembling in form some specimens of the _Ostrea\r\ndeltoidea_, but greatly less in size. The nearest resembling shell in\r\nSowerby is the _Ostrea acuminata_,--an oyster of the clay that underlies\r\nthe great Oolite of Bath. Few of the shells exceed an inch and a half in\r\nlength, and the majority fall short of an inch. What they lack in bulk,\r\nhowever, they make up in number. They are massed as thickly together, to\r\nthe depth of several feet, as shells on the heap at the door of a\r\nNewhaven fisherman, and extend over many acres. Where they lie open we\r\ncan still detect the triangular disc of the hinge, with the single\r\nimpression of the abductor muscle; and the foliaceous character of the\r\nshell remains in most instances as distinct as if it had undergone no\r\nmineral change. I have seen nowhere in Scotland, among the secondary\r\nformations, so unequivocal an oyster-bed; nor do such beds seem to be at\r\nall common in formations older than the Tertiary in England, though the\r\noyster itself is sufficiently so. We find Mantell stating, in his\r\nrecent work (\"Medals of Creation\"), after first describing an immense\r\noyster bed of the London Basin, that underlies the city (for what is now\r\nLondon was once an oyster-bed), that in the chalk below, though it\r\ncontains several species of Ostrea, the shells are diffused\r\npromiscuously throughout the general mass. Leaving, however, these\r\noysters of the Oolite, which never net inclosed nor drag disturbed,\r\nthough they must have formed the food of many an extinct order of\r\nfish,--mayhap reptile,--we pass on in a south-western direction,\r\ndescending in the geological scale as we go, until we reach the southern\r\nside of the Bay of Laig. And there, far below tide-mark, we find a\r\ndark-colored argillaceous shale of the Lias, greatly obscured by\r\nboulders of trap,--the only deposit of the Liasic formation in the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nA line of trap-hills that rises along the shore seems as if it had\r\nstrewed half its materials over the beach. The rugged blocks lie thick\r\nas stones in a causeway, down to the line of low ebb,--memorials of a\r\ntime when the surf dashed against the shattered bases of the trap-hills,\r\nnow elevated considerably beyond its reach; and we can catch but partial\r\nglimpses of the shale below. Wherever access to it can be had, we find\r\nit richly fossiliferous; but its organisms, with the exception of its\r\nBelemnites, are very imperfectly preserved. I dug up from under the\r\ntrap-blocks some of the common Liasic Ammonites of the north-eastern\r\ncoast of Scotland, a few of the septa of a large Nautilus, broken pieces\r\nof wood, and half-effaced casts of what seems a branched coral; but only\r\nminute portions of the shells have been converted into stone; here and\r\nthere a few chambers in the whorls of an Ammonite or Nautilus, though\r\nthe outline of the entire organism lies impressed in the shale; and the\r\nligneous and polyparious fossils we find in a still greater state of\r\ndecay. The Belemnite alone, as is common with this robust fossil,--so\r\noften the sole survivor of its many contemporaries,--has preserved its\r\nstructure entire. I disinterred from the shale good specimens of the\r\nBelemnite _sulcatus_ and Belemnite _elongatus_, and found, detached on\r\nthe surface of the bed, a fragment of a singularly large Belemnite, a\r\nfull inch and a quarter in diameter, the species of which I could not\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nReturning by the track we came, we reach the bottom of the bay, which we\r\nfind much obscured with sand and shingle; and pass northwards along its\r\nside, under a range of low sandstone precipices, with interposing grassy\r\nslopes, in which the fertile Oolitic meniscus descends to the beach. The\r\nsandstone, white and soft, and occurring in thick beds, much resembles\r\nthat of the Oolite of Sutherland. We detect in it few traces of fossils;\r\nnow and then a carbonaceous marking, and now and then what seems a thin\r\nvein of coal, but which proves to be merely the bark of some woody stem,\r\nconverted into a glossy bituminous lignite, like that of Brora. But in\r\nbeds of a blue clay, intercalated with the sandstone, we find fossils in\r\nabundance, of a character less obscure. We spent a full half-hour in\r\npicking out shells from the bottom of a long dock-like hollow among the\r\nrocks, in which a bed of clay has yielded to the waves, while the strata\r\non either side stand up over it like low wharfs on the opposite side of\r\na river. The shells, though exceedingly fragile,--for they partake of\r\nthe nature of the clayey matrix in which they are imbedded,--rise as\r\nentire as when they had died among the mud, years, mayhap ages, ere the\r\nsandstone had been deposited over them; and we were enabled at once to\r\ndetect their extreme dissimilarity, as a group, to the shells of the\r\nLiasic deposit we had so lately quitted. We did not find in this bed a\r\nsingle Ammonite, Belemnite, or Nautilus; but chalky Bivalves, resembling\r\nour existing Tellina, in vast abundance, mixed with what seem to be a\r\nsmall Buccinum and a minute Trochus, with numerous rather equivocal\r\nfragments of a shell resembling an Oiliva. So thickly do they lie\r\nclustered together in this deposit, that in some patches where the\r\nsad-colored argillaceous ground is washed bare by the sea, it seems\r\nmarbled with them into a light gray tint. The group more nearly\r\nresembles in type a recent one than any I have yet seen in a secondary\r\ndeposit, except perhaps in the Weald of Moray, where we find in one of\r\nthe layers a Planorbis scarce distinguishable from those of our ponds\r\nand ditches, mingled with a Paludina that seems as nearly modelled after\r\nthe existing form. From the absence of the more characteristic shells of\r\nthe Oolite, I am inclined to deem the deposit one of estuary origin. Its\r\nclays were probably thrown down, like the silts of so many of our\r\nrivers, in some shallow bay, where the waters of a descending stream\r\nmingled with those of the sea, and where, though shells nearly akin to\r\nour existing periwinkles and whelks congregate thickly, the Belemnite,\r\nseared by the brackish water, never plied its semi-cartilaginous fins,\r\nor the Nautilus or Ammonite hoisted its membranaceous sail.\r\n\r\nWe pass on towards the north. A thick bed of an extremely soft white\r\nsandstone presents here, for nearly half a mile together, its front to\r\nthe waves, and exhibits, under the incessant wear of the surf, many\r\nsingularly grotesque combinations of form. The low precipices,\r\nundermined at the base, beetle over like the sides of stranded vessels.\r\nOne of the projecting promontories we find hollowed through and through\r\nby a tall rugged archway; while the outer pier of the arch,--if pier we\r\nmay term it,--worn to a skeleton, and jutting outwards with a knee-like\r\nangle, presents the appearance of a thin ungainly leg and splay foot,\r\nadvanced, as if in awkward courtesy, to the breakers. But in a winter\r\nor two, judging from its present degree of attenuation, and the yielding\r\nnature of its material, which resembles a damaged mass of arrow-root,\r\nconsolidated by lying in the leaky hold of a vessel, its persevering\r\ncourtesies will be over, and pier and archway must lie in shapeless\r\nfragments on the beach. Wherever the surf has broken into the upper\r\nsurface of this sandstone bed, and worn it down to nearly the level of\r\nthe shore, what seem a number of double ramparts, fronting each other,\r\nand separated by deep square ditches exactly parallel in the sides,\r\ntraverse the irregular level in every direction. The ditches vary in\r\nwidth from one to twelve feet; and the ramparts, rising from three to\r\nsix feet over them, are perpendicular as the walls of houses, where they\r\nfront each other, and descend on the opposite sides in irregular slopes.\r\nThe iron block, with square groove and projecting ears, that receives\r\nthe bar of a railway, and connects it with the stone below, represents\r\nnot inadequately a section of one of these ditches, with its ramparts.\r\nThey form here the sole remains of dykes of an earthy trap, which,\r\nthough at one time in a state of such high fusion that they converted\r\nthe portions of soft sandstone in immediate contact with them into the\r\nconsistence of quartz rock, have long since mouldered away, leaving but\r\nthe hollow rectilinear rents which they had occupied, surmounted by the\r\nindurated walls which they had baked. Some of the most curious\r\nappearances, however, connected with the sandstone, though they occur\r\nchiefly in an upper bed, are exhibited by what seem fields of petrified\r\nmushrooms, of a gigantic size, that spread out in some places for\r\nhundreds of yards under the high-water level. These apparent mushrooms\r\nstand on thick squat stems, from a foot to eighteen inches in height;\r\nthe heads are round like those of toad-stools, and vary from one foot to\r\nnearly two yards in diameter. In some specimens we find two heads\r\njoined together in a form resembling a squat figure of _eight_, of what\r\nprinters term the Egyptian type, or, to borrow the illustration of\r\nM'Culloch, \"like the ancient military projectile known by the name of\r\ndouble-headed shot;\" in other specimens three heads have coalesced in a\r\ntrefoil shape, or rather in a shape like that of an ace of clubs\r\ndivested of the stem. By much the greater number, however, are\r\nspherical. They are composed of concretionary masses, consolidated, like\r\nthe walls of the dykes, though under some different process, into a hard\r\nsiliceous stone, that has resisted those disintegrating influences of\r\nthe weather and the surf, under which the yielding matrix in which they\r\nwere embedded has worn from around them. Here and there we find them\r\nlying detached on the beach, like huge shot, compared with which the\r\ngreenstone balls of Mons Meg are but marbles for children to play with;\r\nin other cases they project from the mural front of rampart-like\r\nprecipices, as if they had been showered into them by the ordnance of\r\nsome besieging battery, and had stuck fast in the mason-work. Abbotsford\r\nhas been described as a romance in stone and lime; we have here, on the\r\nshores of Laig, what seems a wild but agreeable tale, of the extravagant\r\ncast of \"Christabel,\" or the \"Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner,\" fretted\r\ninto sandstone. But by far the most curious part of the story remains to\r\nbe told.\r\n\r\nThe hollows and fissures of the lower sandstone bed we find filled with\r\na fine quartzose sand, which, from its pure white color, and the\r\nclearness with which the minute particles reflect the light, reminds one\r\nof accumulations of potato-flour drying in the sun. It is formed almost\r\nentirely of disintegrated particles of the soft sandstone; and as we at\r\nfirst find it occurring in mere handfuls, that seem as if they had been\r\ndetached from the mass during the last few tides, we begin to marvel to\r\nwhat quarter the missing materials of the many hundred cubic yards of\r\nrock, ground down along the shore in this bed during the last century or\r\ntwo, have been conveyed away. As we pass on northwards, however, we see\r\nthe white sand occurring in much larger quantities,--here heaped up in\r\nlittle bent-covered hillocks above the reach of the tide,--there\r\nstretching out in level, ripple-marked wastes into the waves,--yonder\r\nrising in flat narrow spits among the shallows. At length we reach a\r\nsmall, irregularly-formed bay, a few hundred feet across, floored with\r\nit from side to side; and see it, on the one hand, descending deep into\r\nthe sea, that exhibits over its whiteness a lighter tint of green, and,\r\non the other, encroaching on the land, in the form of drifted banks,\r\ncovered with the plants common to our tracts of sandy downs. The\r\nsandstone bed that has been worn down to form it contains no fossils,\r\nsave here and there a carbonaceous stem; but in an underlying harder\r\nstratum we occasionally find a few shells; and, with a specimen in my\r\nhand charged with a group of bivalves resembling the existing conchifera\r\nof our sandy beaches, I was turning aside this sand of the Oolite, so\r\ncuriously reduced to its original state, and marking how nearly the\r\nrecent shells that lay embedded in it resembled the extinct ones that\r\nhad lain in it so long before, when I became aware of a peculiar sound\r\nthat it yielded to the tread, as my companions paced over it. I struck\r\nit obliquely with my foot, where the surface lay dry and incoherent in\r\nthe sun, and the sound elicited was a shrill, sonorous note, somewhat\r\nresembling that produced by a waxed thread, when tightened between the\r\nteeth and the hand, and tipped by the nail of the forefinger. I walked\r\nover it, striking it obliquely at each step, and with every blow the\r\nshrill note was repeated. My companions joined me; and we performed a\r\nconcert, in which, if we could boast of but little variety in the tones\r\nproduced, we might at least challenge all Europe for an instrument of\r\nthe kind which produced them. It seemed less wonderful that there should\r\nbe music in the granite of Memnon, than in the loose Oolitic sand of the\r\nBay of Laig. As we marched over the drier tracts, an incessant _woo_,\r\n_woo_, _woo_, rose from the surface, that might be heard in the calm\r\nsome twenty or thirty yards away; and we found that where a damp\r\nsemi-coherent stratum lay at the depth of three or four inches beneath,\r\nand all was dry and incoherent above, the tones were loudest and\r\nsharpest, and most easily evoked by the foot. Our discovery,--for I\r\ntrust I may regard it as such,--adds a third locality to two previously\r\nknown ones, in which what may be termed the musical sand,--no unmeet\r\ncounterpart to the \"singing water\" of the tale,--has now been found. And\r\nas the island of Eigg is considerably more accessible than _Jabel\r\nNakous_, in Arabia Petraea, or _Reg-Rawan_, in the neighborhood of Cabul,\r\nthere must be facilities presented through the discovery which did not\r\nexist hitherto, for examining the phenomenon in acoustics which it\r\nexhibits,--a phenomenon, it may be added, which some of our greatest\r\nmasters of the science have confessed their inability to explain.\r\n\r\n_Jabel Nakous_, or the \"Mountain of the Bell,\" is situated about three\r\nmiles from the shores of the Gulf of Suez, in that land of wonders which\r\nwitnessed for forty years the journeyings of the Israelites, and in\r\nwhich the granite peaks of Sinai and Horeb overlook an arid wilderness\r\nof rock and sand. It had been known for many ages by the wild Arab of\r\nthe desert, that there rose at times from this hill a strange,\r\ninexplicable music. As he leads his camel past in the heat of the day, a\r\nsound like the first low tones of an Aeolian harp stirs the hot\r\nbreezeless air. It swells louder and louder in progressive undulations,\r\ntill at length the dry baked earth seems to vibrate under foot, and the\r\nstartled animal snorts and rears, and struggles to break away. According\r\nto the Arabian account of the phenomenon, says Sir David Brewster, in\r\nhis \"Letters on Natural Magic,\" there is a convent miraculously\r\npreserved in the bowels of the hill; and the sounds are said to be those\r\nof the \"_Nakous_, a long metallic ruler, suspended horizontally, which\r\nthe priest strikes with a hammer, for the purpose of assembling the\r\nmonks to prayer.\" There exists a tradition that on one occasion a\r\nwandering Greek saw the mountain open, and that, entering by the gap, he\r\ndescended into the subterranean convent, where he found beautiful\r\ngardens and fountains of delicious water, and brought with him to the\r\nupper world, on his return, fragments of consecrated bread. The first\r\nEuropean traveller who visited _Jabel Nakous_, says Sir David, was M.\r\nSeetzen, a German. He journeyed for several hours over arid sands, and\r\nunder ranges of precipices inscribed by mysterious characters, that\r\ntell, haply, of the wanderings of Israel under Moses. And reaching,\r\nabout noon, the base of the musical fountain, he found it composed of a\r\nwhite friable sandstone, and presenting on two of its sides sandy\r\ndeclivities. He watched beside it for an hour and a quarter, and then\r\nheard, for the first time, a low undulating sound, somewhat resembling\r\nthat of a humming top, which rose and fell, and ceased and began, and\r\nthen ceased again; and in an hour and three quarters after, when in the\r\nact of climbing along the declivity, he heard the sound yet louder and\r\nmore prolonged. It seemed as if issuing from under his knees, beneath\r\nwhich the sand, disturbed by his efforts, was sliding downwards along\r\nthe surface of the rock. Concluding that the sliding sand was the cause\r\nof the sounds, not an effect of the vibrations which they occasioned, he\r\nclimbed to the top of one of the declivities, and, sliding downwards,\r\nexerted himself with hands and feet to set the sand in motion. The\r\neffect produced far exceeded his expectations; the incoherent sand\r\nrolled under and around in a vast sheet; and so loud was the noise\r\nproduced, that \"the earth seemed to tremble beneath him to such a\r\ndegree, that he states he should certainly have been afraid if he had\r\nbeen ignorant of the cause.\" At the time Sir David Brewster wrote\r\n(1832), the only other European who had visited _Jabel Nakous_ was Mr.\r\nGray, of University College, Oxford. This gentleman describes the noises\r\nhe heard, but which he was unable to trace to their producing cause, as\r\n\"beginning with a low continuous murmuring sound, which seemed to rise\r\nbeneath his feet,\" but \"which gradually changed into pulsations as it\r\nbecame louder, so as to resemble the striking of a clock, and became so\r\nstrong at the end of five minutes _as to detach the sand_.\" The Mountain\r\nof the Bell has been since carefully explored by Lieutenant J. Welsted,\r\nof the Indian navy; and the reader may see it exhibited in a fine\r\nlithograph, in his travels, as a vast irregularly conical mass of broken\r\nstone, somewhat resembling one of our Highland cairns, though, of\r\ncourse, on a scale immensely more huge, with a steep, angular slope of\r\nsand resting in a hollow in one of its sides, and rising to nearly its\r\napex. \"It forms,\" says Lieutenant Welsted, \"one of a ridge of low,\r\ncalcareous hills, at a distance of three and a half miles from the\r\nbeach, to which a sandy plain, extending with a gentle rise to their\r\nbase, connects them. Its height, about four hundred feet, as well as the\r\nmaterial of which it is composed,--a light-colored friable\r\nsandstone,--is about the same as the rest of the chain; but an inclined\r\nplane of almost impalpable sand rises at an angle of forty degrees with\r\nthe horizon, and is bounded by a semi-circle of rocks, presenting\r\nbroken, abrupt, and pinnacled forms, and extending to the base of this\r\nremarkable hill. Although their shape and arrangement in some respects\r\nmay be said to resemble a whispering gallery, yet I determined by\r\nexperiment that their irregular surface renders them but ill adapted for\r\nthe production of an echo. Seated at a rock at the base of the sloping\r\neminence, I directed one of the Bedouins to ascend; and it was not until\r\nhe had reached some distance that I perceived the sand in motion,\r\nrolling down the hill to the depth of a foot. It did not, however,\r\ndescend in one continued stream; but, as the Arab scrambled up, it\r\nspread out laterally and upwards, until a considerable portion of the\r\nsurface was in motion. At their commencement the sounds might be\r\ncompared to the faint strains of an Aeolian harp when its strings first\r\ncatch the breeze: as the sand became more violently agitated by the\r\nincreased velocity of the descent, the noise more nearly resembled that\r\nproduced by drawing the moistened fingers over glass. As it reached the\r\nbase, the reverberations attained the loudness of distant thunder,\r\ncausing the rock on which we were seated to vibrate; and our\r\ncamels,--animals not easily frightened,--became so alarmed that it was\r\nwith difficulty their drivers could restrain them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hill of _Reg-Rawan_ or the 'Moving Sand,'\" says the late Sir\r\nAlexander Burnes, by whom the place was visited in the autumn of 1837,\r\nand who has recorded his visit in a brief paper, illustrated by a rude\r\nlithographic view, in the \"Journal of the Asiatic Society\" for 1838, \"is\r\nabout forty miles north of Cabul, towards Hindu-kush, and near the base\r\nof the mountains.\" It rises to the height of about four hundred feet, in\r\nan angle formed by the junction of two ridges of hills; and a sheet of\r\nsand, \"pure as that of the sea-shore,\" and which slopes in an angle of\r\nforty degrees, reclines against it from base to summit. As represented\r\nin the lithograph, there projects over the steep sandy slope on each\r\nside, as in the \"Mountain of the Bell,\" still steeper barriers of rock;\r\nand we are told by Sir Alexander, that though \"the mountains here are\r\ngenerally composed of granite or mica, at _Reg-Rawan_ there is sandstone\r\nand lime.\" The situation of the sand is curious, he adds: it is seen\r\nfrom a great distance; and as there is none other in the neighborhood,\r\n\"it might almost be imagined, from its appearance, that the hill had\r\nbeen cut in two, and that the sand had gushed forth as from a sand-bag.\"\r\n\"When set in motion by a body of people who slide down it, a sound is\r\nemitted. On the first trial we distinctly heard two loud hollow sounds,\r\nsuch as would be given by a large drum;\"--\"there is an echo in the\r\nplace; and the inhabitants have a belief that the sounds are only heard\r\non Friday, when the saint of _Reg-Rawan_, who is interred hard by,\r\npermits.\" The phenomenon, like the resembling one in Arabia, seems to\r\nhave attracted attention among the inhabitants of the country at an\r\nearly period; and the notice of an eastern annalist, the Emperor Baber,\r\nwho flourished late in the fifteenth century, and, like Caesar, conquered\r\nand recorded his conquests, still survives. He describes it as the\r\n_Khwaja Reg-Rawan_, \"a small hill, in which there is a line of sandy\r\nground reaching from the top to the bottom,\" from which there \"issues in\r\nthe summer season the sound of drums and nagarets.\" In connection with\r\nthe fact that the musical sand of Eigg is composed of a disintegrated\r\nsandstone of the Oolite, it is not quite unworthy of notice that\r\nsandstone and lime enter into the composition of the hill of\r\n_Reg-Rawan_,--that the district in which the hill is situated is not a\r\nsandy one,--and that its slope of sonorous sand seems as if it had\r\nissued from its side. These various circumstances, taken together, lead\r\nto the inference that the sand may have originated in the decomposition\r\nof the rock beneath. It is further noticeable, that the _Jabel Nakous_\r\nis composed of a white friable sandstone, resembling that of the white\r\nfriable bed of the Bay of Laig, and that it belongs to nearly the same\r\ngeological era. I owe to the kindness of Dr. Wilson of Bombay, two\r\nspecimens which he picked up in Arabia Petraea, of spines of Cidarites of\r\nthe mace-formed type so common in the Chalk and Oolite, but so rare in\r\nthe older formations. Dr. Wilson informs me that they are of frequent\r\noccurrence in the desert of Arabia Petraea, where they are termed by the\r\nArabs petrified olives; that nummulites are also abundant in the\r\ndistrict; and that the various secondary rocks he examined in his route\r\nthrough it seem to belong to the Cretaceous group. It appears not\r\nimprobable, therefore, that all the sonorous sand in the world yet\r\ndiscovered is formed, like that of Eigg, of disintegrated sandstone; and\r\nat least two-thirds of it of the disintegrated sandstone of secondary\r\nformations, newer than the Lias. But how it should be at all sonorous,\r\nwhatever its age or origin, seems yet to be discovered. There are few\r\nsubstances that appear worse suited than sand to communicate to the\r\natmosphere those vibratory undulations that are the producing causes of\r\nsound: the grains, even when sonorous individually, seem, from their\r\ninevitable contact with each other, to exist under the influence of that\r\nsimple law in acoustics which arrests the tones of the ringing glass or\r\nstruck bell, immediately as they are but touched by some foreign body,\r\nsuch as the hand or finger. The one grain, ever in contact with several\r\nother grains, is a glass or bell on which the hand always rests. And the\r\ndifficulty has been felt and acknowledged. Sir John Herschel, in\r\nreferring to the phenomenon of the _Jabel Nakous_, in his \"Treatise on\r\nSound,\" in the \"Encyclopaedia Metropolitana,\" describes it as to him\r\n\"utterly inexplicable;\" and Sir David Brewster, whom I had the pleasure\r\nof meeting in December last, assured me it was not less a puzzle to him\r\nthan to Sir John. An eastern traveller, who attributes its production\r\nto \"a reduplication of impulse setting air in vibration in a focus of\r\necho,\" means, I suppose, saying nearly the same thing as the two\r\nphilosophers, and merely conveys his meaning in a less simple style.\r\n\r\nI have not yet procured what I expect to procure soon,--sand enough from\r\nthe musical bay at Laig to enable me to make its sonorous qualities the\r\nsubject of experiment at home. It seems doubtful whether a small\r\nquantity set in motion on an artificial slope will serve to evolve the\r\nphenomena which have rendered the Mountain of the Bell so famous.\r\nLieutenant Welsted informs us, that when his Bedouin first set the sand\r\nin motion, there was scarce any perceptible sound heard;--it was rolling\r\ndownwards for many yards around him to the depth of a foot, ere the\r\nmusic arose; and it is questionable whether the effect could be elicited\r\nwith some fifty or sixty pounds weight of the sand of Eigg, on a slope\r\nof but at most a few feet, which it took many hundred weight of sand of\r\n_Jabel Nakous_, and a slope of many yards, to produce. But in the\r\nstillness of a close room, it is just possible that it may. I have,\r\nhowever, little doubt, that from small quantities the sound evoked by\r\nthe foot on the shore may be reproduced: enough will lie within the\r\nreach of experiment to demonstrate the strange difference which exists\r\nbetween this sonorous sand of the Oolite, and the common unsonorous sand\r\nof our sea-beaches; and it is certainly worth while examining into the\r\nnature and producing causes of a phenomenon so curious in itself, and\r\nwhich has been characterized by one of the most distinguished of living\r\nphilosophers as \"the most celebrated of all the acoustic wonders which\r\nthe natural world presents to us.\" In the forthcoming number of the\r\n\"North British Review,\"--which appears on Monday first,[1]--the reader\r\nwill find the sonorous sand of Eigg referred to, in an article the\r\nauthorship of which will scarcely be mistaken. \"We have here,\" says the\r\nwriter, after first describing the sounds of _Jabel Nakous_, and then\r\nreferring to those of Eigg, \"the phenomenon in its simple state,\r\ndisembarrassed from reflecting rocks, from a hard bed beneath, and from\r\ncracks and cavities that might be supposed to admit the sand; and\r\nindicating as its cause, either the accumulated vibration of the air\r\nwhen struck by the driven sand, or the accumulated sounds occasioned by\r\nthe mutual impact of the particles of sand against each other. If a\r\nmusket-ball passing through the air emits a whistling note, each\r\nindividual particle of sand must do the same, however faint be the note\r\nwhich it yields; and the accumulation of these infinitesimal vibrations\r\nmust constitute an audible sound, varying with the number and velocity\r\nof moving particles. In like manner, if two plates of silex or quartz,\r\nwhich are but large crystals of sand, give out a musical sound when\r\nmutually struck, the impact or collision of two minute crystals or\r\nparticles of sand must do the same, in however inferior a degree; and\r\nthe union of all these sounds, though singly imperceptible, may\r\nconstitute the musical notes of the Bell Mountain, or the lesser sounds\r\nof the trodden sea-beach at Eigg.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a vigorous effort made to unlock the difficulty. I should,\r\nhowever, have mentioned to the philosophic writer,--what I inadvertently\r\nfailed to do,--that the sounds elicited from the sand of Eigg seem as\r\ndirectly evoked by the slant blow dealt it by the foot, as the sounds\r\nsimilarly evoked from a highly waxed floor, or a board strewed over with\r\nground rosin. The sharp shrill note follows the stroke, altogether\r\nindependently of the grains driven into the air. My omission may serve\r\nto show how much safer it is for those minds of the observant order,\r\nthat serve as hands and eyes to the reflective ones, to prefer incurring\r\nthe risk of being even tediously minute in their descriptions, to the\r\ndanger of being inadequately brief in them. But, alas! for purposes of\r\nexact science, rarely are verbal descriptions otherwise than inadequate.\r\nLet us look, for example, at the various accounts given us of _Jabel\r\nNakous_. There are strange sounds heard proceeding from a hill in\r\nArabia, and various travellers set themselves to describe them. The\r\ntones are those of the convent _Nakous_, says the wild Arab;--there must\r\nbe a convent buried under the hill. More like the sounds of a\r\nhumming-top, remarks a phlegmatic German traveller. Not quite like them,\r\nsays an English one in an Oxford gown;--they resemble rather the\r\nstriking of a clock. Nay, listen just a little longer and more\r\ncarefully, says a second Englishman, with epaulettes on his shoulder:\r\n\"the sounds at their commencement may be compared to the faint strains\r\nof an Aeolian harp when its strings first catch the breeze,\" but anon, as\r\nthe agitation of the sand increases, they \"more nearly resemble those\r\nproduced by drawing the moistened fingers over glass.\" Not at all,\r\nexclaims the warlike Zahor Ed-din Muhammed Baber, twirling his whiskers:\r\n\"I know a similar hill in the country towards Hindu-kush: it is the\r\nsound of drums and nagarets that issues from the sand.\" All we really\r\nknow of this often-described music of the desert, after reading all the\r\ndescriptions, is, that its tones bear certain analogies to certain other\r\ntones,--analogies that seem stronger in one direction to one ear, and\r\nstronger in another direction to an ear differently constituted, but\r\nwhich do not exactly resemble any other sounds in nature. The strange\r\nmusic of _Jabel Nakous_, as a combination of tones, is essentially\r\nunique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     Trap-Dykes--\"Cotton Apples\"--Alternation of Lacustrine with Marine\r\n     Remains--Analogy from the Beds of Esk--Aspect of the Island on its\r\n     narrow Front--The Puffin--Ru-Stoir--Development of Old Red\r\n     Sandstone--Striking Columnar character of Ru-Stoir--Discovery of\r\n     Reptilian Remains--John Stewart's wonder at the Bones in the\r\n     Stones--Description of the Bones--\"Dragons, Gorgons, and\r\n     Chimeras\"--Exploration and Discovery pursued--The Midway\r\n     Shieling--A Celtic Welcome--Return of the Yacht--\"Array of Fossils\r\n     new to Scotch Geology\"--A Geologist's Toast--Hoffman and his\r\n     Fossil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe leave behind us the musical sand, and reach the point of the\r\npromontory which forms the northern extremity of the Bay of Laig.\r\nWherever the beach has been swept bare, we see it floored with\r\ntrap-dykes worn down to the level, but in most places accumulations of\r\nhuge blocks of various composition cover it up, concealing the nature of\r\nthe rock beneath. The long semi-circular wall of precipice which,\r\nsweeping inwards at the bottom of the bay, leaves to the inhabitants\r\nbetween its base and the beach their fertile meniscus of land, here\r\nabuts upon the coast. We see its dark forehead many hundred feet\r\noverhead, and the grassy platform beneath, now narrowed to a mere talus,\r\nsweeping upwards to its base from the shore,--steep, broken, lined thick\r\nwith horizontal pathways, mottled over with ponderous masses of rock.\r\n\r\nAmong the blocks that load the beach, and render our onward progress\r\ndifficult and laborious, we detect occasional fragments of an\r\namygdaloidal basalt, charged with a white zeolite, consisting of\r\ncrystals so extremely slender that the balls, with their light fibrous\r\ncontents, remind us of cotton apples divested of the seeds. There\r\noccur, though more rarely, masses of a hard white sandstone, abounding\r\nin vegetable impressions, which, from their sculptured markings,\r\nrecalled to memory the Sigillaria of the Coal Measures. Here and there,\r\ntoo, we find fragments of a calcareous stone, so largely charged with\r\ncompressed shells, chiefly bivalves, that it may be regarded as a shell\r\nbreccia. There occur, besides, slabs of fibrous limestone, exactly\r\nresembling the limestone of the ichthyolite beds of the Lower Old Red;\r\nand blocks of a hard gray stone, of silky lustre in the fresh fracture,\r\nthickly speckled with carbonaceous markings. These fragmentary\r\nmasses,--all of them, at least, except the fibrous limestone, which\r\noccurs in mere plank-like bands,--represent distinct beds, of which this\r\npart of the island is composed, and which present their edges, like\r\ncourses of ashlar in a building, in the splendid section that stretches\r\nfrom the tall brow of the precipice to the beach; though in the slopes\r\nof the talus, where the lower beds appear in but occasional protrusions\r\nand land-slips, we find some difficulty in tracing their order of\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nNear the base of the slope, where the soil has been undermined and the\r\nrock laid bare by the waves, there occur beds of a bituminous black\r\nshale,--resembling the dark shales so common in the Coal Measures,--that\r\nseem to be of fresh water or estuary origin. Their fossils, though\r\nnumerous, are ill preserved; but we detect in them scales and plates of\r\nfishes, at least two species of minute bivalves, one of which very much\r\nresembles a Cyclas; and in some of the fragments, shells of Cypris lie\r\nembedded in considerable abundance. After all that has been said and\r\nwritten by way of accounting for those alternations of lacustrine with\r\nmarine remains, which are of such frequent occurrence in the various\r\nformations, secondary and tertiary, from the Coal Measures downwards, it\r\ndoes seem strange enough that the estuary, or fresh-water lake, should\r\nso often in the old geologic periods have changed places with the sea.\r\nIt is comparatively easy to conceive that the inner Hebrides should have\r\nonce existed as a broad ocean sound, bounded on one or either side by\r\nOolitic islands, from which streams descended, sweeping with them, to\r\nthe marine depths, productions, animal and vegetable, of the land. But\r\nit is less easy to conceive, that in that sound, the area covered by the\r\nocean one year should have been covered by a fresh-water lake in perhaps\r\nthe next, and then by the ocean again a few years after. And yet among\r\nthe Oolitic deposits of the Hebrides evidence seems to exist that\r\nchanges of this nature actually took place. I am not inclined to found\r\nmuch on the apparently fresh-water character of the bituminous shales of\r\nEigg;--the embedded fossils are all too obscure to be admitted in\r\nevidence; but there can exist no doubt that fresh water, or at least\r\nestuary formations, do occur among the marine Oolites of the Hebrides.\r\nSir R. Murchison, one of the most cautious, as he is certainly one of\r\nthe most distinguished, of living geologists, found in a northern\r\ndistrict of Skye, in 1826, a deposit containing Cyclas, Paludina,\r\nNeritina,--all shells of unequivocally fresh-water origin,--which must\r\nhave been formed, he concludes, in either a lake or estuary. What had\r\nbeen sea at one period had been estuary or lake at another. In every\r\ncase, however, in which these intercalated deposits are restricted to\r\nsingle strata of no great thickness, it is perhaps safer to refer their\r\nformation to the agency of temporary land-floods, than to that of\r\nviolent changes of level, now elevating and now depressing the surface.\r\nThere occur, for instance, among the marine Oolites of Brora,--the\r\ndiscovery of Mr. Robertson, of Inverugie,--two strata containing\r\nfresh-water fossils in abundance; but the one stratum is little more\r\nthan an inch in thickness,--the other little more than a foot; and it\r\nseems considerably more probable, that such deposits should have owed\r\ntheir existence to extraordinary land-floods, like those which in 1829\r\ndevastated the province of Moray, and covered over whole miles of marine\r\nbeach with the spoils of land and river, than that a sea-bottom should\r\nhave been elevated for their production, into a fresh-water lake, and\r\nthen let down into a sea-bottom again. We find it recorded in the\r\n\"Shepherd's Calendar,\" that after the thaw which followed the great\r\nsnow-storm of 1794, there were found on a part of the sands of the\r\nSolway Frith known as the Beds of Esk, where the tide disgorges much of\r\nwhat is thrown into it by the rivers, \"one thousand eight hundred and\r\nforty sheep, nine black cattle, three horses, two men, one woman,\r\nforty-five dogs, and one hundred and eighty hares, beside a number of\r\nmeaner animals.\" A similar storm in an earlier time, with a soft\r\nsea-bottom prepared to receive and retain its spoils, would have formed\r\na fresh-water stratum intercalated in a marine deposit.\r\n\r\nRounding the promontory, we lose sight of the Bay of Laig, and find the\r\nnarrow front of the island that now presents itself exhibiting the\r\nappearance of a huge bastion. The green talus slopes upwards, as its\r\nbasement, for full three hundred feet; and a noble wall of perpendicular\r\nrock, that towers over and beyond for at least four hundred feet more,\r\nforms the rampart. Save towards the sea, the view is of but limited\r\nextent; we see it restricted, on the landward side, to the bold face of\r\nthe bastion; and in a narrow and broken dell that runs nearly parallel\r\nto the shore for a few hundred yards between the top of the talus and\r\nthe base of the rampart,--a true covered way,--we see but the rampart\r\nalone. But the dizzy front of black basalt, dark as night, save where a\r\nbroad belt of light-colored sandstone traverses it in an angular\r\ndirection, like a white sash thrown across a funeral robe,--the\r\nfantastic peaks and turrets in which the rock terminates atop,--the\r\nmasses of broken ruins, roughened with moss and lichen, that have fallen\r\nfrom above, and lie scattered at its base,--the extreme loneliness of\r\nthe place, for we have left behind us every trace of the human\r\nfamily,--and the expanse of solitary sea which it commands,--all\r\nconspire to render the scene a profoundly imposing one. It is one of\r\nthose scenes in which a man feels that he is little, and that nature is\r\ngreat. There is no precipice in the island in which the puffin so\r\ndelights to build as among the dark pinnacles overhead, or around which\r\nthe silence is so frequently broken by the harsh scream of the eagle.\r\nThe sun had got far adown the sky ere we had reached the covered way at\r\nthe base of the rock. All lay dark below; and the red light atop, half\r\nabsorbed by the dingy hues of the stone, shone with a gleam so faint and\r\nmelancholy, that it served but to deepen the effect of the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe puffin, a comparatively rare bird in the inner Hebrides, builds, I\r\nwas told, in great numbers in the continuous line of precipice which,\r\nafter sweeping for a full mile round the Bay of Laig, forms the\r\npinnacled rampart here, and then, turning another angle of the island,\r\nruns on parallel to the coast for about six miles more. In former times\r\nthe puffin furnished the islanders, as in St. Kilda, with a staple\r\narticle of food, in those hungry months of summer in which the stores of\r\nthe old crop had begun to fail, and the new crop had not yet ripened;\r\nand the people of Eigg, taught by their necessities, were bold cragsmen.\r\nBut men do not peril life and limb for the mere sake of a meal, save\r\nwhen they cannot help it; and the introduction of the potato has done\r\nmuch to put out the practice of climbing for the bird, except among a\r\nfew young lads, who find excitement enough in the work to pursue it for\r\nits own sake, as an amusement. I found among the islanders what was\r\nsaid to be a piece of the natural history of the puffin, sufficiently\r\napocryphal to remind one of the famous passage in the history of the\r\nbarnacle, which traced the lineage of the bird to one of the\r\npedunculated cirripedes, and the lineage of the cirripede to a log of\r\nwood. The puffin feeds its young, say the islanders, on an oily scum of\r\nthe sea, which renders it such an unwieldy mass of fat, that about the\r\ntime when it should be beginning to fly, it becomes unable to get out of\r\nits hole. The parent bird, not in the least puzzled, however, treats the\r\ncase medicinally, and,--like mothers of another two-legged genus, who,\r\nwhen their daughters get over stout, put them through a course of\r\nreducing acids to bring them down,--feeds it on sorrel leaves for\r\nseveral days together, till, like a boxer under training, it gets\r\nthinned to the proper weight, and becomes able, not only to get out of\r\nits cell, but also to employ its wings.\r\n\r\nWe pass through the hollow, and, reaching the farther edge of the\r\nbastion, towards the east, see a new range of prospect opening before\r\nus. There is first a long unbroken wall of precipice,--a continuation of\r\nthe tall rampart overhead,--relieved along its irregular upper line by\r\nthe blue sky. We mark the talus widening at its base, and expanding, as\r\non the shores of the Bay of Laig, into an irregular grassy platform,\r\nthat, sinking midway into a ditch-like hollow, rises again towards the\r\nsea, and presents to the waves a perpendicular precipice of redstone.\r\nThe sinking sun shone brightly this evening; and the warm hues of the\r\nprecipice, which bears the name of _Ru-Stoir_,--the Red\r\nHead,--strikingly contrasted with the pale and dark tints of the\r\nalternating basalts and sandstones in the taller cliff behind. The\r\nditch-like hollow, which seems to indicate the line of a fault, cuts off\r\nthis red headland from all the other rocks of the island, from which it\r\nappears to differ as considerably in texture as in hue. It consists\r\nmainly of thick beds of a pale red stone, which M'Culloch regarded as a\r\ntrap, and which, intercalated with here and there a thin band of shale,\r\nand presenting not a few of the mineralogical appearances of what\r\ngeologists of the school of the late Mr. Cunningham term Primary Old Red\r\nSandstone, in some cases has been laid down as a deposit of Old Red\r\nproper, abutting in the line of a fault on the neighboring Oolites and\r\nbasalts. In the geological map which I carried with me,--not one of high\r\nauthority however,--I found it actually colored as a patch of this\r\nancient system. The Old Red Sandstone is largely developed in the\r\nneighboring island of Rum, in the line of which the _Ru-Stoir_ seems to\r\nhave a more direct bearing than any of the other deposits of Eigg; and\r\nyet the conclusion regarding this red headland merely adds one proof\r\nmore to the many furnished already, of the inadequacy of mineralogical\r\ntestimony, when taken in evidence regarding the eras of the geologist.\r\nThe hard red beds of _Ru-Stoir_ belong, as I was fortunate enough this\r\nevening to ascertain, not to the ages of the Coccosteus and Pterichthys,\r\nbut to the far later ages of the Plesiosaurus and the fossil crocodile.\r\nI found them associated with more reptilian remains, of a character more\r\nunequivocal than have been yet exhibited by any other deposit in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nWhat first strikes the eye, in approaching the _Ru-Stoir_ from the west,\r\nis the columnar character of the stone. The precipices rise immediately\r\nover the sea, in rude colonnades of from thirty to fifty feet in height;\r\nsingle pillars, that have fallen from their places in the line, and\r\nexhibit a tenacity rare among the trap-rocks,--for they occur in\r\nunbroken lengths of from ten to twelve feet,--lie scattered below; and\r\nin several places where the waves have joined issue with the precipices\r\nin the line on which the base of the columns rest, and swept away the\r\nsupporting foundation, the colonnades open into roomy caverns, that\r\nresound to the dash of the sea. Wherever the spray lashes, the pale red\r\nhue of the stone prevails, and the angles of the polygonal shafts are\r\nrounded; while higher up all is sharp-edged, and the unweathered surface\r\nis covered by a gray coat of lichens. The tenacity of the prostrate\r\ncolumns first drew my attention. The builder scant of materials would\r\nhave experienced no difficulty in finding among them sufficient lintels\r\nfor apertures from eight to twelve feet in width. I was next struck with\r\nthe peculiar composition of the stone; it much rather resembles an\r\naltered sandstone, in at least the weathered specimens, than a trap, and\r\nyet there seemed nothing to indicate that it was an _Old Red_ Sandstone.\r\nIts columnar structure bore evidence to the action of great heat; and\r\nits pale red color was exactly that which the Oolitic sandstones of the\r\nisland, with their slight ochreous tinge, would assume in a common fire.\r\nAnd so I set myself to look for fossils. In the columnar stone itself I\r\nexpected none, as none occur in vast beds of the unaltered sandstones,\r\nout of some one of which I supposed it might possibly have been formed;\r\nand none I found: but in a rolled block of altered shale of a much\r\ndeeper red than the general mass, and much more resembling Old Red\r\nSandstone, I succeeded in detecting several shells, identical with those\r\nof the deposit of blue clay described in a former chapter. There\r\noccurred in it the small univalve resembling a Trochus, together with\r\nthe oblong bivalve, somewhat like a Tellina; and, spread thickly\r\nthroughout the block, lay fragments of coprolitic matter, and the scales\r\nand teeth of fishes. Night was coming on, and the tide had risen on the\r\nbeach; but I hammered lustily, and laid open in the dark red shale a\r\nvertebral joint, a rib, and a parallelogramical fragment of solid bone,\r\nnone of which could have belonged to any fish. It was an interesting\r\nmoment for the curtain to drop over the promontory of _Ru-Stoir_; I had\r\nthus already found in connection with it well nigh as many reptilian\r\nremains as had been found in all Scotland before,--for there could exist\r\nno doubt that the bones I laid open were such; and still more\r\ninteresting discoveries promised to await the coming morning, and a less\r\nhasty survey. We found a hospitable meal awaiting us at a picturesque\r\nold two-story house, with, what is rare in the island, a clump of trees\r\nbeside it, which rises on the northern angle of the Oolitic meniscus;\r\nand after our day's hard work in the fresh sea-air, we did ample justice\r\nto the viands. Dark night had long set in ere we reached our vessel.\r\n\r\nNext day was Saturday; and it behooved my friend, the minister,--as\r\nscrupulously careful in his pulpit preparations for the islanders of\r\nEigg as if his congregation were an Edinburgh one,--to remain on board,\r\nand study his discourse for the morrow. I found, however, no unmeet\r\ncompanion for my excursion in his trusty mate John Stewart. John had not\r\nvery much English, and I had no Gaelic; but we contrived to understand\r\none another wonderfully well; and ere evening I had taught him to be\r\nquite as expert in hunting dead crocodiles as myself. We reached the\r\n_Ru-Stoir_, and set hard to work with hammer and chisel. The fragments\r\nof red shale were strewed thickly along the shore for at least three\r\nquarters of a mile; wherever the red columnar rock appeared, there lay\r\nthe shale, in water-worn blocks, more or less indurated; but the beach\r\nwas covered over with shingle and detached masses of rock, and we could\r\nnowhere find it _in situ_. A winter storm powerful enough to wash the\r\nbeach bare might do much to assist the explorer. There is a piece of\r\nshore on the eastern coast of Scotland, on which for years together I\r\nused to pick up nodular masses of lime containing fish of the Old Red\r\nSandstone; but nowhere in the neighborhood could I find the ichthyolite\r\nbed in which they had originally formed. The storm of a single night\r\nswept the beach; and in the morning the ichthyolites lay revealed _in\r\nsitu_ under a stratum of shingle which I had a hundred times examined,\r\nbut which, though scarce a foot in thickness, had concealed from me the\r\nichthyolite bed for five twelvemonths together!\r\n\r\nWherever the altered shale of _Ru-Stoir_ has been thrown high on the\r\nbeach, and exposed to the influences of the weather, we find it fretted\r\nover with minute organisms, mostly the scales, plates, bones, and teeth\r\nof fishes. The organisms, as is frequently the case, seem\r\nindestructible, while the hard matrix in which they are embedded has\r\nweathered from around them. Some of the scales present the rhomboidal\r\noutline, and closely resemble those of the _Lepidotus Minor_ of the\r\nWeald; others approximate in shape to an isosceles triangle. The teeth\r\nare of various forms: some of them, evidently palatal, are mere blunted\r\nprotuberances glittering with enamel,--some of them present the usual\r\nslim, thorn-like type common in the teeth of the existing fish of our\r\ncoasts,--some again are squat and angular, and rest on rectilinear\r\nbases, prolonged considerably on each side of the body of the tooth,\r\nlike the rim of a hat or the flat head of a scupper nail. Of the\r\noccipital plates, some present a smooth enamelled surface, while some\r\nare thickly tuberculated,--each tubercle bearing a minute depression in\r\nits apex, like a crater on the summit of a rounded hill. We find\r\nreptilian bones in abundance,--a thing new to Scotch geology,--and in a\r\nstate of keeping peculiarly fine. They not a little puzzled John\r\nStewart: he could not resist the evidence of his senses: they were\r\nbones, he said, real bones,--there could be no doubt of that: _there_\r\nwere the joints of a backbone, with the hole the brain-marrow had\r\npassed through; and _there_ were shank-bones and ribs, and fishes'\r\nteeth; but how, he wondered, had they all got into the very heart of the\r\nhard red stones? He had seen what was called wood, he said, dug out of\r\nthe side of the Scuir, without being quite certain whether it was wood\r\nor no; but there could be no uncertainty here. I laid open numerous\r\nvertebrae of various forms,--some with long spinous processes rising over\r\nthe body or _centrum_ of the bone,--which I found in every instance,\r\nunlike that of the Ichthyosaurus, only moderately concave on the\r\narticulating faces; in others the spinous process seemed altogether\r\nwanting. Only two of the number bore any mark of the suture which\r\nunites, in most reptiles, the annular process to the centrum; in the\r\nothers both centrum and process seemed anchylosed, as in quadrupeds,\r\ninto one bone; and there remained no scar to show that the suture had\r\never existed. In some specimens the ribs seem to have been articulated\r\nto the sides of the centrum; in others there is a transverse process,\r\nbut no marks of articulation. Some of the vertebrae are evidently dorsal,\r\nsome cervical, one apparently caudal; and almost all agree in showing in\r\nfront two little eyelets, to which the great descending artery seems to\r\nhave sent out blood-vessels in pairs. The more entire ribs I was lucky\r\nenough to disinter have, as in those of crocodileans, double heads; and\r\na part of a fibula, about four inches in length, seems also to belong to\r\nthis ancient family. A large proportion of the other bones are evidently\r\nPlesiosaurian. I found the head of the flat humerus so characteristic of\r\nthe extinct order to which the Plesiosaurus has been assigned, and two\r\ndigital bones of the paddle, that, from their comparatively slender and\r\nslightly curved form, so unlike the digitals of its cogener the\r\nIchthyosaurus, could have belonged evidently to no other reptile. I\r\nobserved, too, in the slightly curved articulations of not a few of the\r\nvertebrae, the gentle convexity in the concave centre, which, if not\r\npeculiar to the Plesiosaurus, is at least held to distinguish it from\r\nmost of its contemporaries. Among the various nondescript organisms of\r\nthe shale, I laid open a smooth angular bone, hollowed something like a\r\ngrocer's scoop; a three-pronged caltrop-looking bone, that seems to have\r\nformed part of a pelvic arch; another angular bone, much massier than\r\nthe first, regarding the probable position of which I could not form a\r\nconjecture, but which some of my geological friends deem cerebral; an\r\nextremely dense bone, imperfect at each end, which presents the\r\nappearance of a cylinder slightly flattened; and various curious\r\nfragments, which, with what our Scotch museums have not yet\r\nacquired,--entire reptilian fossils for the purposes of\r\ncomparison,--might, I doubt not, be easily assigned to their proper\r\nplaces. It was in vain that, leaving John to collect the scattered\r\npieces of shale in which the bones occurred, I set myself again and\r\nagain to discover the bed from which they had been detached. The tide\r\nhad fallen, and a range of skerries lay temptingly off, scarce a hundred\r\nyards from the water's edge: the shale beds might be among them, with\r\nPlesiosauri and crocodiles stretching entire; and fain would I have swum\r\noff to them, as I had done oftener than once elsewhere, with my hammer\r\nin my teeth, and with shirt and drawers in my hat; but a tall brown\r\nforest of kelp and tangle in which even a seal might drown, rose thick\r\nand perilous round both shore and skerries; a slight swell was felting\r\nthe long fronds together; and I deemed it better, on the whole, that the\r\ndiscoveries I had already made should be recorded, than that they should\r\nbe lost to geology, mayhap for a whole age, in the attempt to extend\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe water, beautifully transparent, permitted the eye to penetrate into\r\nits green depths for many fathoms around, though every object\r\npresented, through the agitated surface, an uncertain and fluctuating\r\noutline. I could see, however, the pink-colored urchin warping himself\r\nup, by his many cables, along the steep rock-sides; the green crab\r\nstalking along the gravelly bottom; a scull of small rock-cod darting\r\nhither and thither among the tangle-roots; and a few large medusae slowly\r\nflapping their continuous fins of gelatine in the opener spaces, a few\r\ninches under the surface. Many curious families had their\r\nrepresentatives within the patch of sea which the eye commanded; but the\r\nstrange creatures that had once inhabited it by thousands, and whose\r\nbones still lay sepulchred on its shores, had none. How strange, that\r\nthe identical sea heaving around stack and skerry in this remote corner\r\nof the Hebrides should have once been thronged by reptile shapes more\r\nstrange than poet ever imagined,--dragons, gorgons and chimeras! Perhaps\r\nof all the extinct reptiles, the Plesiosaurus was the most\r\nextraordinary. An English geologist has described it, grotesquely\r\nenough, and yet most happily, as a snake _threaded_ through a tortoise.\r\nAnd here on this very spot, must these monstrous dragons have disported\r\nand fed; here must they have raised their little reptile heads and long\r\nswan-like necks over the surface, to watch an antagonist or select a\r\nvictim; here must they have warred and wedded, and pursued all the\r\nvarious instincts of their unknown natures. A strange story, surely,\r\nconsidering it is a true one! I may mention in the passing, that some of\r\nthe fragments of the shale in which the remains are embedded have been\r\nbaked by the intense heat into an exceedingly hard, dark-colored stone,\r\nsomewhat resembling basalt. I must add further, that I by no means\r\ndetermine the rock with which we find it associated to be in reality an\r\naltered sandstone. Such is the appearance which it presents where\r\nweathered; but its general aspect is that of a porphyritic trap. Be it\r\nwhat it may, the fact is not at all affected, that the shores, wherever\r\nit occurs on this tract of insular coast, are strewed with reptilian\r\nremains of the Oolite.\r\n\r\nThe day passed pleasantly in the work of exploration and discovery; the\r\nsun had already declined far in the west; and, bearing with us our\r\nbetter fossils, we set out, on our return, by the opposite route to that\r\nalong the Bay of Laig, which we had now thrice walked over. The grassy\r\ntalus so often mentioned continues to run on the eastern side of the\r\nisland for about six miles, between the sea and the inaccessible rampart\r\nof precipice behind. It varies in breadth from about two to four hundred\r\nyards; the rampart rises over it from three to five hundred feet; and a\r\nnoble expanse of sea, closed in the distance by a still nobler curtain\r\nof blue hills, spreads away from its base: and it was along this grassy\r\ntalus that our homeward road lay. Let the Edinburgh reader imagine the\r\nfine walk under Salisbury Crags lengthened some twenty times,--the line\r\nof precipices above heightened some five or six times,--the gravelly\r\nslope at the base not much increased in altitude, but developed\r\ntransversely into a green undulating belt of hilly pasture, with here\r\nand there a sunny slope level enough for the plough, and here and there\r\na rough wilderness of detached crags and broken banks; let him further\r\nimagine the sea sweeping around the base of this talus, with the nearest\r\nopposite land--bold, bare and undulating atop--some six or eight miles\r\ndistant; and he will have no very inadequate idea of the peculiar and\r\nstriking scenery through which, this evening, our homeward route lay. I\r\nhave scarce ever walked over a more solitary tract. The sea shuts it in\r\non the one hand, and the rampart of rocks on the other; there occurs\r\nalong its entire length no other human dwelling than a lonely summer\r\nshieling; for full one-half the way we saw no trace of man; and the\r\nwildness of the few cattle which we occasionally startled in the\r\nhollows showed us that man was no very frequent visitor among them.\r\nAbout half an hour before sunset we reached the midway shieling.\r\n\r\nRarely have I seen a more interesting spot, or one that, from its utter\r\nloneliness, so impressed the imagination. The shieling, a rude\r\nlow-roofed erection of turf and stone, with a door in the centre some\r\nfive feet in height or so, but with no window, rose on the grassy slope\r\nimmediately in front of the vast continuous rampart. A slim pillar of\r\nsmoke ascends from the roof, in the calm, faint and blue within the\r\nshadow of the precipice, but it caught the sunlight in its ascent, and\r\nblushed, ere it melted into the ether, a ruddy brown. A streamlet came\r\npouring from above in a long white thread, that maintained its\r\ncontinuity unbroken for at least two-thirds of the way; and then,\r\nuntwisting into a shower of detached drops, that pattered loud and\r\nvehemently in a rocky recess, it again gathered itself up into a lively\r\nlittle stream, and, sweeping past the shieling, expanded in front into a\r\ncircular pond, at which a few milch cows were leisurely slaking their\r\nthirst. The whole grassy talus, with a strip mayhap a hundred yards\r\nwide, of deep green sea, lay within the shadow of the tall rampart; but\r\nthe red light fell, for many a mile beyond, on the glassy surface; and\r\nthe distant Cuchullin Hills, so dark at other times, had all their\r\nprominent slopes and jutting precipices tipped with bronze; while here\r\nand there a mist streak, converted into bright flame, stretched along\r\ntheir peaks or rested on their sides. Save the lonely shieling, not a\r\nhuman dwelling was in sight. An island girl of eighteen, more than\r\nmerely good-looking, though much embrowned by the sun, had come to the\r\ndoor to see who the unwonted visitors might be, and recognized in John\r\nStewart an old acquaintance. John informed her in her own language that\r\nI was Mr. Swanson's sworn friend, and not a _Moderate_, but one of their\r\nown people, and that I had fasted all day, and had come for a drink of\r\nmilk. The name of her minister proved a strongly recommendatory one: I\r\nhave not yet seen the true Celtic interjection of welcome,--the kindly\r\n\"O o o,\"--attempted on paper; but I had a very agreeable specimen of it\r\non this occasion, _viva voce_. And as she set herself to prepare for us\r\na rich bowl of mingled milk and cream, John and I entered the shieling.\r\nThere was a turf fire at the one end, at which there sat two little\r\ngirls, engaged in keeping up the blaze under a large pot, but sadly\r\ndiverted from their work by our entrance; while the other end was\r\noccupied by a bed of dry straw, spread on the floor from wall to wall,\r\nand fenced off at the foot by a line of stones. The middle space was\r\noccupied by the utensils and produce of the dairy,--flat wooden vessels\r\nof milk, a butter-churn, and a tub half-filled with curd; while a few\r\ncheeses, soft from the press, lay on a shelf above. The little girls\r\nwere but occasional visitors, who had come, out of a juvenile frolic, to\r\npass the night in the place; but I was informed by John that the\r\nshieling had two other inmates, young women, like the one so hospitably\r\nengaged in our behalf, who were out at the milking, and that they lived\r\nhere all alone for several months every year, when the pasturage was at\r\nits best, employed in making butter and cheese for their master, worthy\r\nMr. M'Donald of Keill. They must often feel lonely when night has closed\r\ndarkly over mountain and sea, or in those dreary days of mist and rain\r\nso common in the Hebrides, when nought may be seen save the few\r\nshapeless crags that stud the nearer hillocks around them, and nought\r\nheard save the moaning of the wind in the precipices above, or the\r\nmeasured dash of the wave on the wild beach below. And yet they would do\r\nill to exchange their solitary life and rude shieling for the village\r\ndwellings and gregarious habits of the females who ply their rural\r\nlabors in bands among the rich fields of the Lowlands, or for the\r\nunwholesome backroom and weary task-work of the city seamstress. The\r\nsunlight was fading from the higher hill-tops of Skye and Glenelg as we\r\nbade farewell to the lonely shieling and the hospitable island girl.\r\n\r\nThe evening deepened as we hurried southwards along the scarce visible\r\npathway, or paused for a few seconds to examine some shattered block,\r\nbulky as a Highland cottage, that had fallen from the precipice above.\r\nNow that the whole landscape lay equally in shadow, one of the more\r\npicturesque peculiarities of the continuous rampart came out more\r\nstrongly as a feature of the scene than when a strip of shade rested\r\nalong the face of the rock, imparting to it a retiring character, and\r\nall was sunshine beyond. A thick bed of white sandstone, as continuous\r\nas the rampart itself, runs nearly horizontally about midway in the\r\nprecipice for mile after mile, and, standing out in strong contrast with\r\nthe dark-colored trap above and below, reminds one of a belt of white\r\nhewn work in a basalt house front, or rather,--for there occurs above a\r\nsecond continuous strip, of an olive hue, the color assumed, on\r\nweathering by a bed of amygdaloid,--of a piece of dingy old-fashioned\r\nfurniture, inlaid with one stringed belt of bleached holly, and another\r\nof faded green-wood. At some of the more accessible points I climbed to\r\nthe line of white belting, and found it to consist of the same soft\r\nquartzy sandstone that in the Bay of Laig furnishes the musical sand.\r\nLower down there occur, alternating with the trap, beds of shale and of\r\nblue clay, but they are lost mostly in the talus. Ill adapted to resist\r\nthe frosts and rains of winter, their exposed edges have mouldered into\r\na loose soil, now thickly covered over with herbage; and, but for the\r\ncircumstance that we occasionally find them laid bare by a water-course,\r\nwe would scarce be aware of their existence at all. The shale exhibits\r\neverywhere, as on the opposite side of the _Ru-Stoir_, faint\r\nimpressions of a minute shell resembling a Cyclas, and ill-preserved\r\nfragments of fish-scales. The blue clay I found at one spot where the\r\npathway had cut deep into the hill-side, richly charged with bivalves of\r\nthe species I had seen so abundant in the resembling clay of the Bay of\r\nLaig; but the closing twilight prevented me from ascertaining whether it\r\nalso contained the characteristic univalves of the deposit, and whether\r\nits shells,--for they seem identical with those of the altered shales of\r\nthe _Ru-Stoir_,--might not be associated, like these, with reptilian\r\nremains. Night fell fast, and the streaks of mist that had mottled the\r\nhills at sunset began to spread gray over the heavens in a continuous\r\ncurtain; but there was light enough left to show me that the trap became\r\nmore columnar as we neared our journey's end. One especial jutting in\r\nthe rock presented in the gloom the appearance of an ancient portico,\r\nwith pediment and cornice, such as the traveller sees on the hill-sides\r\nof Petraea in front of some old tomb; but it may possibly appear less\r\narchitectural by day. At length, passing from under the long line of\r\nrampart, just as the stars that had begun to twinkle over it were\r\ndisappearing, one after one, in the thickening vapor, we reached the\r\nlittle bay of Kildonan, and found the boat waiting us on the beach. My\r\nfriend the minister, as I entered the cabin, gathered up his notes from\r\nthe table, and gave orders for the tea-kettle; and I spread out before\r\nhim--a happy man--an array of fossils new to Scotch Geology. No one not\r\nan enthusiastic geologist or a zealous Roman Catholic can really know\r\nhow vast an amount of interest may attach to a few old bones. Has the\r\nreader ever heard how fossil relics once saved the dwelling of a monk,\r\nin a time of great general calamity, when all his other relics proved of\r\nno avail whatever?\r\n\r\nThomas Campbell, when asked for a toast in a society of authors, gave\r\nthe memory of Napoleon Bonaparte; significantly adding, \"he once hung a\r\nbookseller.\" On a nearly similar principle I would be disposed to\r\npropose among geologists a grateful bumper in honor of the revolutionary\r\narmy that besieged Maestricht. That city, some seventy-five or eighty\r\nyears ago, had its zealous naturalist in the person of M. Hoffmann, a\r\ndiligent excavator in the quarries of St. Peter's mountain, long\r\ncelebrated for its extraordinary fossils. Geology, as a science, had no\r\nexistence at the time; but Hoffmann was doing, in a quiet way, all he\r\ncould to give it a beginning;--he was transferring from the rock to his\r\ncabinet, shells, and corals, and crustacea, and the teeth and scales of\r\nfishes, with now and then the vertebrae, and now and then the limb-bone,\r\nof a reptile. And as he honestly remunerated all the workmen he\r\nemployed, and did no manner of harm to any one, no one heeded him. On\r\none eventful morning, however, his friends the quarriers laid bare a\r\nmost extraordinary fossil,--the occipital plates of an enormous saurian,\r\nwith jaws four and a half feet long, bristling over with teeth, like\r\n_chevaux de frise_; and after Hoffmann, who got the block in which it\r\nlay embedded, cut out entire, and transferred to his house, had spent\r\nweek after week in painfully relieving it from the mass, all Maestricht\r\nbegan to speak of it as something really wonderful. There is a cathedral\r\non St. Peter's mountain,--the mountain itself is church-land; and the\r\nlazy canon, awakened by the general talk, laid claim to poor Hoffmann's\r\nwonderful fossil as _his_ property. He was lord of the manor, he said,\r\nand the mountain and all that it contained belonged to him. Hoffmann\r\ndefended his fossil as he best could in an expensive lawsuit; but the\r\njudges found the law clean against him; the huge reptile head was\r\ndeclared to be \"treasure trove\" escheat to the lord of the manor; and\r\nHoffmann, half broken-hearted, with but his labor and the lawyer's bills\r\nfor his pains, saw it transferred by rude hands from its place in his\r\nmuseum, to the residence of the grasping churchman. The huge fossil head\r\nexperienced the fate of Dr. Chalmer's two hundred churches. Hoffmann was\r\na philosopher, however, and he continued to observe and collect as\r\nbefore; but he never found such another fossil; and at length, in the\r\nmidst of his ingenious labors, the vital energies failed within him, and\r\nhe broke down and died. The useless canon lived on. The French\r\nRevolution broke out; the republican army invested Maestricht; the\r\nbatteries were opened; and shot and shell fell thick on the devoted\r\ncity. But in one especial quarter there alighted neither shot nor shell.\r\nAll was safe around the canon's house. Ordinary relics would have\r\navailed him nothing in the circumstances,--no, not \"the three kings of\r\nCologne,\" had he possessed the three kings entire, or the jaw-bones of\r\nthe \"eleven thousand virgins;\" but there was virtue in the jaw-bones of\r\nthe Mosasaurus, and safety in their neighborhood. The French _savans_,\r\nlike all the other _savans_ of Europe, had heard of Hoffmann's fossil,\r\nand the French artillery had been directed to play wide of the place\r\nwhere it lay. Maestricht surrendered; the fossil was found secreted in a\r\nvault, and sent away to the _Jardin des Plantes_ at Paris, maugre the\r\ncanon, to delight there the heart of Cuvier; and the French, generously\r\naddressing themselves to the heirs of Hoffmann as its legitimate owners,\r\nmade over to them a considerable sum of money as its price. They\r\nreversed the finding of the Maestricht judges; and all save the monks of\r\nSt. Peter's have acquiesced in the justice of the decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     Something for Non-geologists--Man Destructive--A Better and Last\r\n     Creation coming--A Rainy Sabbath--The Meeting House--The\r\n     Congregation--The Sermon in Gaelic--The Old Wondrous Story--The\r\n     Drunken Minister of Eigg--Presbyterianism without Life--Dr.\r\n     Johnson's Account of the Conversion of the People of Rum--Romanism\r\n     at Eigg--The Two Boys--The Freebooter of Eigg--Voyage Resumed--The\r\n     Homeless Minister--Harbor of Isle Ornsay--Interesting Gneiss\r\n     Deposit--A Norwegian Keep--Gneiss at Knock--Curious\r\n     Chemistry--Sea-cliffs beyond Portsea--The Goblin Luidag--Scenery of\r\n     Skye.\r\n\r\n\r\nI reckon among my readers a class of non-geologists, who think my\r\ngeological chapters would be less dull if I left out the geology; and\r\nanother class of semi-geologists, who say there was decidedly too much\r\ngeology in my last. With the present chapter, as there threatens to be\r\nan utter lack of science in the earlier half of it, and very little, if\r\nany, in the latter half, I trust both classes may be in some degree\r\nsatisfied. It will bear reference to but the existing system of\r\nthings,--assuredly not the last of the consecutive creations,--and to a\r\nspecies of animal that, save in the celebrated Guadaloupe specimens, has\r\nnot yet been found locked up in stone. There have been much of violence\r\nand suffering in the old immature stages of being,--much, from the era\r\nof the Holoptychius, with its sharp murderous teeth and strong armor of\r\nbone, down to that of the cannibal Ichthyosaurus, that bears the broken\r\nremains of its own kind in its bowels,--much, again, from the times of\r\nthe crocodile of the Oolite, down to the times of the fossil hyena and\r\ngigantic shark of the Tertiary. Nor, I fear, have matters greatly\r\nimproved in that latest-born creation in the series, that recognizes as\r\nits delegated lord the first tenant of earth accountable to his Maker.\r\nBut there is a better and a last creation coming, in which man shall\r\nre-appear, not to oppress and devour his fellow-men, and in which there\r\nshall be no such wrongs perpetrated as it is my present purpose to\r\nrecord,--\"new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\"\r\nWell sung the Ayrshire ploughman, when musing on the great truth that\r\nthe present scene of being \"is surely not the last,\"--a truth\r\ncorroborated since his day by the analogies of a new science,--\r\n\r\n \"The poor, oppressed, honest man,\r\n   Had never sure been born,\r\n Had not there been some recompense\r\n   To comfort those that mourn.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Sabbath, but the morning rose like a hypochondriac wrapped up in\r\nhis night-clothes,--gray in fog, and sad with rain. The higher grounds\r\nof the island lay hid in clouds, far below the level of the central\r\nhollow; and our whole prospect from the deck was limited to the nearer\r\nslopes, dank, brown, and uninhabited, and to the rough black crags that\r\nfrown like sentinels over the beach. Now the rime thickened as the rain\r\npattered more loudly on the deck; and even the nearer stacks and\r\nprecipices showed as unsolid and spectral in the cloud as moonlight\r\nshadows thrown on a ground of vapor; anon it cleared up for a few\r\nhundred yards, as the shower lightened; and then there came in view,\r\npartially at least, two objects that spoke of man,--a deserted boat\r\nharbor, formed of loosely piled stone, at the upper extremity of a sandy\r\nbay; and a roofless dwelling beside it, with two ruinous gables rising\r\nover the broken walls. The entire scene suggested the idea of a land\r\nwith which man had done for ever;--the vapor-enveloped rocks,--the waste\r\nof ebb-uncovered sand,--the deserted harbor,--the ruinous house,--the\r\nmelancholy rain-fretted tides eddying along the strip of brown tangle in\r\nthe foreground,--and, dim over all, the thick, slant lines of the\r\nbeating shower!--I know not that of themselves they would have furnished\r\nmaterials enough for a finished picture in the style of Hogarth's \"End\r\nof all Things;\" but right sure am I that in the hands of Bewick they\r\nwould have been grouped into a tasteful and poetic vignette. We set out\r\nfor church a little after eleven,--the minister encased in his\r\nample-skirted storm-jacket of oiled canvas, and protected atop by a\r\ngenuine _sou-wester_, of which the broad posterior rim eloped half a\r\nyard down his back; and I closely wrapped up in my gray maud, which\r\nproved, however, a rather indifferent protection against the penetrating\r\npowers of a true Hebridean drizzle. The building in which the\r\ncongregation meets is a low dingy cottage of turf and stone, situated\r\nnearly opposite to the manse windows. It had been built by my friend,\r\nprevious to the Disruption, at his own expense, for a Gaelic school, and\r\nit now serves as a place of worship for the people.\r\n\r\nWe found the congregation already gathered, and that the very bad\r\nmorning had failed to lessen their numbers. There were a few of the male\r\nparishioners keeping watch at the door, looking wistfully out through\r\nthe fog and rain for their minister; and at his approach nearly twenty\r\nmore came issuing from the place,--like carder bees from their nest of\r\ndried grass and moss,--to gather round him, and shake him by the hand.\r\nThe islanders of Eigg are an active, middle-sized race, with\r\nwell-developed heads, acute intellects, and singularly warm feelings.\r\nAnd on this occasion at least there could be no possibility of mistake\r\nrespecting the feelings with which they regarded their minister. Rarely\r\nhave I seen human countenances so eloquently vocal with veneration and\r\nlove. The gospel message, which my friend had been the first effectually\r\nto bring home to their hearts,--the palpable fact of his sacrifice for\r\nthe sake of the high principles which he has taught,--his own kindly\r\ndisposition,--the many services which he has rendered them, for not only\r\nhas he been the minister, but also the sole medical man, of the Small\r\nIsles, and the benefit of his practice they have enjoyed, in every\r\ninstance, without fee or reward,--his new life of hardship and danger,\r\nmaintained for their sakes amid sinking health and great\r\nprivation,--their frequent fears for his safety when stormy nights close\r\nover the sea,--and they have seen his little vessel driven from her\r\nanchorage, just as the evening has fallen,--all these are circumstances\r\nthat have concurred in giving him a strong hold on their affections.\r\n\r\nThe rude turf-building we found full from end to end, and all a-steam\r\nwith a particularly wet congregation, some of whom, neither very robust\r\nnor young, had travelled in the soaking drizzle from the farther\r\nextremities of the island. And, judging from the serious attention with\r\nwhich they listened to the discourse, they must have deemed it full\r\nvalue for all it cost them. I have never yet seen a congregation more\r\ndeeply impressed, or that seemed to follow the preacher more\r\nintelligently; and I was quite sure, though ignorant of the language in\r\nwhich my friend addressed them, that he preached to them neither heresy\r\nnor nonsense. There was as little of the reverence of externals in the\r\nplace as can well be imagined: an uneven earthen floor,--turf-walls on\r\nevery side, and a turf-roof above,--two little windows of four panes\r\na-piece, adown which the rain-drops were coursing thick and fast,--a\r\npulpit grotesquely rude, that had never employed the bred\r\ncarpenter,--and a few ranges of seats of undressed deal, such were the\r\nmere materialisms of this lowly church of the people; and yet here,\r\nnotwithstanding, was the living soul of a Christian\r\ncommunity,--understandings convinced of the truth of the gospel, and\r\nhearts softened and impressed by its power.\r\n\r\nMy friend, at the conclusion of his discourse, gave a brief digest of\r\nits contents in English, for the benefit of his one Saxon auditor; and I\r\nfound, as I had anticipated, that what had so moved the simple islanders\r\nwas just the old wondrous story, which, though repeated and re-repeated\r\ntimes beyond number, from the days of the apostles till now, continues\r\nto be as full of novelty and interest as ever,--\"God so loved the world,\r\nthat he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him\r\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life.\" The great truths which\r\nhad affected many of these poor people to tears, were exactly those\r\nwhich, during the last eighteen hundred years, have been active in\r\neffecting so many moral revolutions in the world, and which must\r\nultimately triumph over all error and all oppression. On this occasion,\r\nas on many others, I had to regret my want of Gaelic. It was my\r\nmisfortune to miss being born to this ancient language, by barely a mile\r\nof ferry. I first saw light on the southern shore of the Frith of\r\nCromarty, where the strait is narrowest, among an old established\r\nLowland community, marked by all the characteristics, physical and\r\nmental, of the Lowlanders of the southern districts; whereas, had I been\r\nborn on the northern shore, I would have been brought up among a Celtic\r\ntribe, and Gaelic would have been my earliest language. Thus distinct\r\nwas the line between the two races preserved, even after the\r\ncommencement of the present century.\r\n\r\nIn returning to the Betsey during the mid-day interval in the service,\r\nwe passed the ruinous two-gabled house beside the boat-harbor. During\r\nthe incumbency of my friend's predecessor, it had been the public-house\r\nof the island, and the parish minister was by far its best customer. He\r\nwas in the practice of sitting in one of its dingy little rooms, day\r\nafter day, imbibing whisky and peat-reek; and his favorite boon\r\ncompanion on these occasions was a Roman Catholic tenant who lived on\r\nthe opposite side of the island, and who, when drinking with the\r\nminister, used regularly to fasten his horse beside the door, till at\r\nlength all the parish came to know that when the horse was standing\r\noutside the minister was drinking within. In course of time, through the\r\nnatural gravitation operative in such cases, the poor incumbent became\r\nutterly scandalous, and was libelled for drunkenness before the General\r\nAssembly; but, as the island of Eigg lies remote from observation,\r\nevidence was difficult to procure; and had not the infatuated man got\r\nsenselessly drunk one evening, when in Edinburgh on his trial, and\r\nstaggered, of all places in the world, into the General Assembly, he\r\nwould probably have died minister of Eigg. As the event happened,\r\nhowever, the testimony thus unwittingly furnished in the face of the\r\nCourt that tried him was deemed conclusive;--he was summarily deposed\r\nfrom his office, and my friend succeeded him. Presbyterianism without\r\nthe animating life is a poor shrunken thing: it never lies in state when\r\nit is dead; for it has no body of fine forms, or trapping of imposing\r\nceremonies, to give it bulk or adornment: without the vitality of\r\nevangelism it is nothing; and in this low and abject state my friend\r\nfound the Presbyterianism of Eigg. His predecessor had done it only\r\nmischief; nor had it been by any means vigorous before. Rum is one of\r\nthe four islands of the parish; and all my readers must be familiar with\r\nDr. Johnson's celebrated account of the conversion to Protestantism of\r\nthe people of Rum. \"The inhabitants,\" says the Doctor, in his \"Journey\r\nto the Western Islands,\" \"are fifty-eight families, who continued\r\nPapists for some time after the laird became a Protestant. Their\r\nadherence to their old religion was strengthened by the countenance of\r\nthe laird's sister, a zealous Romanist; till one Sunday, as they were\r\ngoing to mass under the conduct of their patroness, Maclean met them on\r\nthe way, gave one of them a blow on the head with a yellow stick,--I\r\nsuppose a cane, for which the Erse had no name, and drove them to the\r\nkirk, from which they have never departed. Since the use of this method\r\nof conversion, the inhabitants of Eigg and Canna who continue Papists\r\ncall the Protestantism of Rum the religion of the yellow stick.\" Now,\r\nsuch was the kind of Protestantism that, since the days of Dr. Johnson,\r\nhad also been introduced, I know not by what means, into Eigg. It had\r\nlived on the best possible terms with the Popery of the island; the\r\nparish minister had soaked day after day in the public-house with a\r\nRoman Catholic boon companion; and when a Papist man married a\r\nProtestant woman, the woman, as a matter of course, became Papist also;\r\nwhereas, when it was the man who was a Protestant, and the woman a\r\nPapist, the woman remained what she had been. Roman Catholicism was\r\nquite content with terms, actual though not implied, of a kind so\r\ndecidedly advantageous; and the Roman Catholics used good-humoredly to\r\nurge on their neighbors the Protestants, that, as it was palpable they\r\nhad no religion of any kind, they had better surely come over to them,\r\nand have some. In short, all was harmony between the two Churches. My\r\nfriend labored hard, as a good and honest man ought, to impart to\r\nProtestantism in his parish the animating life of the Reformation; and,\r\nthrough the blessing of God, after years of anxious toil, he at length\r\nfully succeeded.\r\n\r\nI had got wet, and the day continued bad; and so, instead of returning\r\nto the evening sermon, which began at six, I remained alone aboard of\r\nthe vessel. The rain ceased in little more than an hour after, and in\r\nsomewhat more than two hours I got up on deck to see whether the\r\ncongregation was not dispersing, and if it was not yet time to hang on\r\nthe kettle for our evening tea. The unexpected apparition of some one\r\naboard the Free Church yacht startled two ragged boys who were\r\nmanoeuvring a little boat a stone-cast away, under the rocky shores of\r\n_Eilean Chaisteil_, and who, on catching a glimpse of me, flung\r\nthemselves below the thwarts for concealment. An oar dropped into the\r\nwater; there was a hasty arm and half a head thrust over the gunwale to\r\nsecure it; and then the urchin to whom they belonged again disappeared.\r\nMeanwhile the boat drifted slowly away: first one little head would\r\nappear for a moment over the gunwale, then another, as if reconnoitering\r\nthe enemy; but I still kept my place on deck; and at length, tired out,\r\nthe ragged little crew took to their oars, and rowed into a shallow bay\r\nat the lower extremity of the glebe, with a cottage, in size and\r\nappearance much resembling an ant-hill, peeping out at its inner\r\nextremity among some stunted bushes. I had marked the place before, and\r\nhad been struck with the peculiarity of the choice that could have fixed\r\non it as a site for a dwelling: it is at once the most inconvenient and\r\npicturesque on this side the island. A semi-circular line of columnar\r\nprecipices, that somewhat resembles an amphitheatre turned outside\r\nin,--for the columns that overlook the area are quite as lofty as those\r\nwhich should form the amphitheatre's outer wall,--sweeps round a little\r\nbay, flat and sandy at half-tide, but bordered higher up by a dingy,\r\nscarce passable beach of columnar fragments that have toppled from\r\nabove. Between the beach and the line of columns there is a bosky talus,\r\nmore thickly covered with brushwood than is at all common in the\r\nHebrides, and scarce more passable than the rough beach at its feet. And\r\nat the bottom of this talus, with its one gable buried in the steep\r\nascent,--for there is scarce a foot-breadth of platform between the\r\nslope and the beach,--and with the other gable projected to the\r\ntide-line on rugged columnar masses, stands the cottage. The story of\r\nthe inmate,--the father of the two ragged boys,--is such a one as Crabbe\r\nwould have delighted to tell, and as he could have told better than any\r\none else.\r\n\r\nHe had been, after a sort, a freebooter in his time, but born an age or\r\ntwo rather late; and the law had proved over strong for him. On at least\r\none occasion, perhaps oftener,--for his adventures are not all known in\r\nEigg,--he had been in prison for sheep-stealing. He had the dangerous\r\nart of subsisting without the ostensible means, and came to be feared\r\nand avoided by his neighbors as a man who lived on them without asking\r\ntheir leave. With neither character nor a settled way of living, his\r\nwits, I am afraid, must have been often whetted by his necessities: he\r\nstole lest he should starve. For some time he had resided in the\r\nadjacent island of Muck; but, proving a bad tenant, he had been ejected\r\nby the agent of the landlord, I believe a very worthy man, who gave him\r\nhalf a boll of meal to get quietly rid of him, and pulled down his\r\nhouse, when he had left the island, to prevent his return. Betaking\r\nhimself, with his boys, to a boat, he set out in quest of some new\r\nlodgment. He made his first attempt or two on the mainland, where he\r\nstrove to drive a trade in begging, but he was always recognized as the\r\nconvicted sheep-stealer, and driven back to the shore. At length, after\r\na miserable term of wandering, he landed in the winter season on Eigg,\r\nwhere he had a grown-up son, a miller; and, erecting a wretched shed\r\nwith some spars and the old sail of a boat placed slantways against the\r\nside of a rock, he squatted on the beach, determined, whether he lived\r\nor died, to find a home on the island. The islanders were no strangers\r\nto the character of the poor forlorn creature, and kept aloof from\r\nhim,--none of them, however, so much as his own son; and, for a time, my\r\nfriend the minister, aware that he had been the pest of every community\r\namong which he had lived, stood aloof from him too, in the hope that at\r\nlength, wearied out, he might seek for himself a lodgment elsewhere.\r\nThere came on, however, a dreary night of sleet and rain, accompanied by\r\na fierce storm from the sea; and intelligence reached the manse late in\r\nthe evening, that the wretched sheep-stealer had been seized by sudden\r\nillness, and was dying on the beach. There could be no room for further\r\nhesitation in this case; and my friend the minister gave instant orders\r\nthat the poor creature should be carried to the manse. The party,\r\nhowever, which he had sent to remove him found the task impracticable.\r\nThe night was pitch dark; and the road, dangerous with precipices, and\r\nblocked up with rough masses of rock and stone, they found wholly\r\nimpassable with so helpless a burden. And so, administering some\r\ncordials to the poor, hapless wretch, they had to leave him in the midst\r\nof the storm, with the old wet sail flapping about his ears, and the\r\nhalf-frozen rain pouring in upon him in torrents. He must have passed a\r\nmiserable night, but it could not have been a whit more miserable than\r\nthat passed by the minister in the manse. As the wild blast howled\r\naround his comfortable dwelling, and shook the casements as if some hand\r\noutside were assaying to open them, or as the rain pattered sharp and\r\nthick on the panes, and the measured roar of the surf rose high over\r\nevery other sound, he could think of only the wretched creature exposed\r\nto the fury of a tempest so terrible, as perchance wrestling in his\r\ndeath agony in the darkness beside the breaking wave, or as already\r\nstiffening on the shore. He was early astir next morning, and almost the\r\nfirst person he met was the poor sheep-stealer, looking more like a\r\nghost than a living man. The miserable creature had mustered strength\r\nenough to crawl up from the beach. My friend has often met better men\r\nwith less pleasure. He found a shelter for the poor outcast; he tended\r\nhim, prescribed for him, and, on his recovery, gave him leave to build\r\nfor himself the hovel at the foot of the crags. The islanders were aware\r\nthey had got but an indifferent neighbor through the transaction, though\r\nnone of them, with the exception of the poor creature's son, saw what\r\nelse their minister could have done in the circumstances. But the miller\r\ncould sustain no apology for the arrangement that had given him his\r\nvagabond father as a neighbor; and oftener than once the site of the\r\nrising hovel became a scene of noisy contention between parent and son.\r\nSome of the islanders informed me that they had seen the son engaged in\r\npulling down the stones of the walls as fast as the father raised them\r\nup; and, save for the interference of the minister, the hut,\r\nnotwithstanding the permission he gave, would scarce have been built.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Monday we unloosed from our moorings, and set out with\r\na light variable breeze for Isle Ornsay, in Skye, where the wife and\r\nfamily of Mr. Swanson resided, and from which he had now been absent for\r\na full month. The island diminished, and assumed its tint of diluting\r\nblue, that waxed paler and paler hour after hour, as we left it slowly\r\nbehind us; and the Scuir, projected boldly from its steep hill-top,\r\nresembled a sharp hatchet-edge presented to the sky. \"Nowhere,\" said my\r\nfriend, \"did I so thoroughly realize the Disruption of last year as at\r\nthis spot. I had just taken my last leave of the manse; Mrs. Swanson had\r\nstaid a day behind me in charge of a few remaining pieces of furniture,\r\nand I was bearing some of the rest, and my little boy Bill, scarce five\r\nyears of age at the time, in the yacht with me to Skye. The little\r\nfellow had not much liked to part from his mother, and the previous\r\nunsettling of all sorts of things in the manse had bred in him thoughts\r\nhe had not quite words to express. The further change to the yacht, too,\r\nhe had deemed far from an agreeable one. But he had borne up, by way of\r\nbeing very manly; and he seemed rather amused that papa should now have\r\nto make his porridge for him, and to put him to bed, and that it was\r\nJohn Stewart, the sailor, who was to be the servant girl. The passage,\r\nhowever, was tedious and disagreeable; the wind blew a-head, and heart\r\nand spirits failing poor Bill, and somewhat sea-sick to boot, he lay\r\ndown on the floor, and cried bitterly to be taken home. 'Alas, my boy!'\r\nI said, 'you have no home now: your father is like the poor\r\nsheep-stealer whom you saw on the shore of Eigg.' This view of matters\r\nproved in no way consolatory to poor Bill. He continued his sad wail,\r\n'Home, home, home!' until at length he fairly sobbed himself asleep; and\r\nI never, on any other occasion, so felt the desolateness of my condition\r\nas when the cry of my boy,--'Home, home, home!'--was ringing in my\r\nears.\"\r\n\r\nWe passed, on the one hand, Loch Nevis and Loch Hourn, two fine arms of\r\nthe sea that run far into the mainland, and open up noble vistas among\r\nthe mountains; and, on the other, the long undulating line of Sleat in\r\nSkye, with its intermingled patches of woodland and arable on the coast,\r\nand its mottled ranges of heath and rock above. Towards evening we\r\nentered the harbor of Isle Ornsay, a quiet, well-sheltered bay, with a\r\nrocky islet for a breakwater on the one side, and the rudiments of a\r\nHighland village, containing a few good houses, on the other. Half a\r\ndozen small vessels were riding at anchor, curtained round, half-mast\r\nhigh, with herring nets; and a fleet of herring-boats lay moored beside\r\nthem a little nearer the shore. There had been tolerable takes for a few\r\nnights in the neighboring sea, but the fish had again disappeared, and\r\nthe fishermen, whose worn-out tackle gave such evidence of a\r\nlong-continued run of ill-luck, as I had learned to interpret on the\r\neast coast, looked gloomy and spiritless, and reported a deficient\r\nfishery. I found Mrs. Swanson and her family located in one of the two\r\nbest houses in the village, with a neat enclosure in front, and a good\r\nkitchen-garden behind. The following day I spent in exploring the rocks\r\nof the district,--a primary region with regard to organic existence,\r\n\"without _form_ and void.\" From Isle Ornsay to the Point of Sleat, a\r\ndistance of thirteen miles, gneiss is the prevailing deposit; and in no\r\nplace in the district are the strata more varied and interesting than in\r\nthe neighborhood of Knockhouse, the residence of Mr. Elder, which I\r\nfound pleasingly situated at the bottom of a little open bay, skirted\r\nwith picturesque knolls partially wooded, that present to the surf\r\nprecipitous fronts of rock. One insulated eminence, a gun-shot from the\r\ndwelling-house, that presents to the sea two mural fronts of precipice,\r\nand sinks in steep grassy slopes on two sides more, bears atop a fine\r\nold ruin. There is a blind-fronted massy keep, wrapped up in a mantle of\r\nivy, perched at the one end, where the precipice sinks steepest; while a\r\nmore ruinous though much more modern pile of building, perforated by a\r\ndouble row of windows, occupies the rest of the area. The square keep\r\nhas lost its genealogy in the mists of the past, but a vague tradition\r\nattributes its erection to the Norwegians. The more modern pile is said\r\nto have been built about three centuries ago by a younger son of\r\nM'Donald of the Isles; but it is added that, owing to the jealousy of\r\nhis elder brother, he was not permitted to complete or inhabit it. I\r\nfind it characteristic of most Highland traditions, that they contain\r\nspeeches: they constitute true oral specimens of that earliest and\r\nrudest style of historic composition in which dialogue alternates with\r\nnarrative. \"My wise brother is building a fine house,\" is the speech\r\npreserved in this tradition as that of the elder son: \"it is rather a\r\npity for himself that he should be building it on another man's lands.\"\r\nThe remark was repeated to the builder, says the story, and at once\r\narrested the progress of the work. Mr. Elder's boys showed me several\r\nminute pieces of brass, somewhat resembling rust-eaten coin, that they\r\nhad dug out of the walls of the old keep; but the pieces bore no impress\r\nof the dye, and seemed mere fragments of metal beaten thin by the\r\nhammer.\r\n\r\nThe gneiss at Knock is exceedingly various in its composition, and many\r\nof its strata the geologist would fail to recognize as gneiss at all. We\r\nfind along the precipices its two unequivocal varieties, the schistose\r\nand the granitic, passing not unfrequently, the former into a true mica\r\nschist, the latter into a pale feldspathose rock, thickly pervaded by\r\nneedle-like crystals of tremolite, that, from the style of the grouping,\r\nand the contrast existing between the dark green of the enclosed\r\nmineral, and the pale flesh-color of the ground, frequently furnishes\r\nspecimens of great beauty. In some pieces the tremolite assumes the\r\ncommon fan-like form; in some, the crystals, lying at nearly right\r\nangles with each other, present the appearance of ancient characters\r\ninlaid in the rock; in some they resemble the footprints of birds in a\r\nthin layer of snow; and in one curious specimen picked up by Mr.\r\nSwanson, in which a dark linear strip is covered transversely by\r\ncrystals that project thickly from both its sides, the appearance\r\npresented is that of a minute stigmaria of the Coal Measures, with the\r\nleaves, still bearing their original green color, bristling thick around\r\nit. Mr. Elder showed me, intercalated among the gneiss strata of a\r\nlittle ravine in the neighborhood of Isle Ornsay, a thin band of a\r\nbluish-colored indurated clay, scarcely distinguishable, in the hand\r\nspecimen, from a weathered clay-stone, but unequivocally a stratum of\r\nthe rock. I have found the same stone existing, in a decomposed state,\r\nas a very tenacious clay, among the gneiss strata of the hill of\r\nCromarty; and oftener than once had I amused myself in fashioning it,\r\nwith tolerable success, into such rude pieces of pottery as are\r\nsometimes found in old sepulchral tumuli. Such are a few of the rocks\r\nincluded in the general gneiss deposit of Sleat. If we are to hold, with\r\none of the most distinguished of living geologists, that the stratified\r\nprimary rocks are aqueous deposits altered by heat, to how various a\r\nchemistry must they not have been subjected in this district! In one\r\nstratum, so softened that all its particles were disengaged to enter\r\ninto new combinations, and yet not so softened but that it still\r\nmaintained its lines of division from the strata above and below, the\r\ngreen tremolite was shooting its crystals into the pale homogeneous\r\nmass; while in another stratum the quartz drew its atoms apart in masses\r\nthat assumed one especial form, the feldspar drew its atoms apart into\r\nmasses that assumed another and different form, and the glittering mica\r\nbuilt up its multitudinous layers between. Here the unctuous chlorite\r\nconstructed its soft felt; there the micaceous schist arranged its\r\nundulating layers; yonder the dull clay hardened amid the intense heat,\r\nbut, when all else was changing, retained its structure unchanged.\r\nSurely a curious chemistry, and conducted on an enormous scale!\r\n\r\nIt had been an essential part of my plan to explore the splendid section\r\nof the Lower Oolite furnished by the line of sea-cliffs that, to the\r\nnorth of the Portree, rise full seven hundred feet over the beach; and\r\non the morning of Wednesday I set out with this intention from Isle\r\nOrnsay, to join the mail gig at Broadford, and pass on to Portree,--a\r\njourney of rather more than thirty miles. I soon passed over the gneiss,\r\nand entered on a wide deposit, extending from side to side of the\r\nisland, of what is generally laid down in our geological maps as Old Red\r\nSandstone, but which, in most of its beds, quite as much resembles a\r\nquartz rock, and which, unlike any Old Red proper I have ever seen,\r\npasses, by insensible gradations, into the gneiss.[2] Wherever it has\r\nbeen laid bare in flat tables among the heath, we find it bearing those\r\nmysterious scratches on a polished surface which we so commonly find\r\nassociated on the mainland with the boulder clay; but here, as in the\r\nHebrides generally, the boulder clay is wanting. To the tract of Red\r\nSandstone there succeeds a tract of Lias, which, also extending across\r\nthe island, forms by far the most largely-developed deposit of this\r\nformation in Scotland. It occupies a flat dingy valley, about six miles\r\nin length, and that varies from two to four miles in breadth. The dreary\r\ninterior is covered with mosses, and studded with inky pools, in which\r\nthe botanist finds a few rare plants, and which were dimpled, as I\r\npassed them this morning, with countless eddies, formed by myriads of\r\nsmall quick glancing trout, that seemed busily engaged in fly-catching.\r\nThe rock appears but rarely,--all is moss, marsh, and pool; but in a few\r\nlocalities on the hill-sides, where some stream has cut into the slope,\r\nand disintegrated the softer shales, the shepherd finds shells of\r\nstrange form strewed along the water-courses, or bleaching white among\r\nthe heath. The valley,--evidently a dangerous one to the night\r\ntraveller, from its bogs and its tarns,--is said to be haunted by a\r\nspirit peculiar to itself,--a mischievous, eccentric, grotesque\r\ncreature, not unworthy, from the monstrosity of its form, of being\r\nassociated with the old monsters of the Lias. Luidag--for so the goblin\r\nis called--has but one leg, terminating, like an ancient satyr's, in a\r\ncloven foot; but it is furnished with two arms, bearing hard fists at\r\nthe end of them, with which it has been known to strike the benighted\r\ntraveller in the face, or to tumble him over into some dark pool. The\r\nspectre may be seen at the close of evening hopping vigorously among the\r\ndistant bogs, like a felt ball on its electric platform; and when the\r\nmist lies thick in the hollows, an occasional glimpse may be caught of\r\nit even by day. But when I passed the way there was no fog: the light,\r\nthough softened by a thin film of cloud, fell equally over the heath,\r\nrevealing hill and hollow; and I was unlucky enough not to see this\r\ngoblin of the Liasic valley.\r\n\r\nA deep indentation of the coast, which forms the bay of Broadford,\r\ncorresponds with the hollow of the valley. It is simply a portion of the\r\nvalley itself occupied by the sea; and we find the Lias, from its lower\r\nto its upper beds, exposed in unbroken series along the beach. In the\r\nmiddle of the opening lies the green level island of Pabba, altogether\r\ncomposed of this formation, and which, differing, in consequence, both\r\nin outline and color, from every neighboring island and hill, seems a\r\nlittle bit of flat fertile England, laid down, as if for contrast's\r\nsake, amid the wild rough Hebrides. Of Pabba and its wonders, however,\r\nmore anon. I explored a considerable range of shore along the bay; but\r\nas I made it the subject of two after explorations ere I mastered its\r\ndeposits, I shall defer my description till a subsequent chapter. It was\r\nlate this evening ere the post-gig arrived from the south, and the night\r\nand several hours of the following morning were spent in travelling to\r\nPortree. I know not, however, that I could have seen some of the wildest\r\nand most desolate tracts in Skye to greater advantage. There was light\r\nenough to show the bold outlines of the hills,--lofty, abrupt,\r\npyramidal,--just such hills, both in form and grouping, as a profile in\r\nblack showed best; a low blue vapor slept in the calm over the marshes\r\nat their feet; the sea, smooth as glass, reflected the dusk twilight\r\ngleam in the north, revealing the narrow sounds and deep\r\nmountain-girdled lochs along which we passed; gray crags gleamed dimly\r\non the sight; birch-feathered acclivities presented against sea and sky\r\ntheir rough bristly edges; all was vast, dreamy, obscure, like one of\r\nMartin's darker pictures: the land of the seer and the spectre could not\r\nhave been better seen. Morning broke dim and gray, while we were yet\r\nseveral miles from Portree; and I reached the inn in time to see from my\r\nbed-room windows the first rays of the rising sun gleaming on the\r\nhill-tops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Exploration resumed--Geology of Rasay--An Illustration--Storr of\r\n     Skye--From Portree to Holm--Discovery of Fossils--An Island\r\n     Rain--Sir R. Murchison--Labor of drawing a Geological Line--Three\r\n     Edinburgh Gentlemen--_Prosopolepsia_--Wrong surmises corrected--The\r\n     Mail Gig--The Portree Postmaster--Isle Ornsay--An Old\r\n     Acquaintance--Reminiscences--A Run for Rum--\"Semi-fossil\r\n     Madeira\"--Idling on Deck--Prognostics of a Storm--Description of\r\n     the Gale--Loch Scresort--The Minister's lost _Sou-wester_--The Free\r\n     Church Gathering--The weary Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\nI breakfasted in the travellers' room with three gentlemen from\r\nEdinburgh; and then, accompanied by a boy, whom I had engaged to carry\r\nmy bag, set out to explore. The morning was ominously hot and\r\nbreathless; and while the sea lay moveless in the calm, as a floor of\r\npolished marble, mountain and rock, and distant island, seemed tremulous\r\nall over, through a wavy medium of thick rising vapor. I judged from the\r\nfirst that my course of exploration for the day was destined to\r\nterminate abruptly; and as my arrangements with Mr. Swanson left me, for\r\nthis part of the country, no second day to calculate upon, I hurried\r\nover deposits which in other circumstances I would have examined more\r\ncarefully,--content with a glance. Accustomed in most instances to take\r\nlong aims, as Cuddy Headrig did, when he steadied his musket on a rest\r\nbehind the hedge, and sent his ball through Laird Oliphant's forehead, I\r\nhad on this occasion to shoot flying; and so, selecting a large object\r\nfor a mark, that I might run the less risk of missing, I strove to\r\nacquaint myself rather with the general structure of the district than\r\nwith the organisms of its various fossiliferous beds.\r\n\r\nThe long narrow island of Rasay lies parallel to the coast of Skye,\r\nlike a vessel laid along a wharf, but drawn out from it as if to suffer\r\nanother vessel of the same size to take her berth between; and on the\r\neastern shores of both Skye and Rasay we find the same Oolitic deposits\r\ntilted up at nearly the same angle. The section presented on the eastern\r\ncoast of the one is nearly a duplicate of the section presented on the\r\neastern coast of the other. During one of the severer frosts of last\r\nwinter I passed along a shallow pond, studded along the sides with\r\nboulder stones. It had been frozen over; and then, from the evaporation\r\nso common in protracted frosts, the water had shrunk, and the sheet of\r\nice which had sunk down over the central portion of the pond exhibited\r\nwhat a geologist would term very considerable marks of disturbance among\r\nthe boulders at the edges. Over one sharp-backed boulder there lay a\r\nsheet tilted up like the lid of a chest half-raised; and over another\r\nboulder immediately behind it there lay another uptilted sheet, like the\r\nlid of a second half-open chest; and in both sheets, the edges, lying in\r\nnearly parallel lines, presented a range of miniature cliffs to the\r\nshore. Now, in the two uptilted ice-sheets of this pond I recognized a\r\nmodel of the fundamental Oolitic deposits Rasay and Skye. The mainland\r\nof Scotland had its representative in the crisp snow-covered shore of\r\nthe pond, with its belt of faded sedges; the place of Rasay was\r\nindicated by the inner, that of Skye by the outer boulder; while the\r\nice-sheets, with their shoreward-turned line of cliffs, represented the\r\nOolitic beds, that turn to the mainland their dizzy range of precipices,\r\nvarying from six to eight hundred feet in height, and then, sloping\r\noutwards and downwards, disappear under mountain wildernesses of\r\noverlying trap. And it was along a portion of the range of cliff that\r\nforms the outermost of the two uptilted lines, and which presents in\r\nthis district of Skye a frontage of nearly twenty continuous miles to\r\nthe long Sound of Rasay, that my to-day's course of exploration lay.\r\nFrom the top of the cliff the surface slopes downwards for about two\r\nmiles into the interior, like the half-raised chest-lid of my\r\nillustration sloping towards the hinges, or the uptilted ice-table of\r\nthe boulder sloping towards the centre of the pond; and the depression\r\nbehind forms a flat moory valley, full fifteen miles in length, occupied\r\nby a chain of dark bogs and treeless lochans. A long line of trap-hills\r\nrises over it, in one of which, considerably in advance of the others, I\r\nrecognized the Storr of Skye, famous among lovers of the picturesque for\r\nits strange group of mingled pinnacles and towers; while directly\r\ncrossing into the valley from the Sound, and then running southwards for\r\nabout two miles along its bottom, is the noble sea-arm, Loch Portree, in\r\nwhich, as indicated by the name (the King's Port) a Scottish king of the\r\nolden time, in his voyage round his dominions, cast anchor. The opening\r\nof the loch is singularly majestic;--the cliffs tower high on either\r\nside in graceful magnificence: but from the peculiar inward slope of the\r\nland, all within, as the loch reaches the line of the valley, becomes\r\ntame and low, and a black dreary moor stretches from the flat terminal\r\nbasin into the interior. The opening of Loch Portree is a palace\r\ngateway, erected in front of some homely suburb, that occupies the place\r\nwhich the palace itself should have occupied.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, no such mixture of the homely and the magnificent in\r\nthe route I had selected to explore. It lay under the escarpment of the\r\ncliff; and I purposed pursuing it from Portree to Holm, a distance of\r\nabout six miles, and then returning by the flat interior valley. On the\r\none hand rose a sloping rampart, full seven hundred feet in height,\r\nstriped longitudinally with alternating bands of white sandstone and\r\ndark shale, and capped atop by a continuous coping of trap, that lacked\r\nnot massy tower, and overhanging turret, and projecting sentry-box;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, spreading outwards in the calm from the line\r\nof dark trap-rocks below, like a mirror from its carved frame of black\r\noak, lay the Sound of Rasay, with its noble background of island and\r\nmain rising bold on the east, and its long mountain vista opening to the\r\nsouth. The first fossiliferous deposit which gave me occasion this\r\nmorning to use my hammer occurs near the opening of the loch, beside an\r\nold Celtic burying-ground, in the form of a thick bed of hard sandstone,\r\ncharged with Belemnites,--a bed that must at one time have existed as a\r\nwidely-spread accumulation of sand,--the bottom, mayhap, of some\r\nextensive bay of the Oolite, resembling the Loch Portree of the present\r\nday, in which eddy tides deposited the sand swept along by the tidal\r\ncurrents of some neighboring sound, and which swarmed as thickly with\r\nCephalopoda as the loch swarmed this day with minute purple-tinged\r\nMedusae. I found detached on the shore, immediately below this bed, a\r\npiece of calcareous fissile sandstone, abounding in small sulcated\r\nTerebratulae, identical, apparently, with the Terebratula of a specimen\r\nin my collection from the inferior Oolite of Yorkshire. A colony of this\r\ndelicate Brachiopod must have once lain moored near this spot, like a\r\nfleet of long-prowed galleys at anchor, each one with its cable of many\r\nstrands extended earthwards from the single _dead-eye_ in its umbone.\r\nFor a full mile after rounding the northern boundary of the loch, we\r\nfind the immense escarpment composed from top to bottom exclusively of\r\ntrap; but then the Oolite again begins to appear, and about two miles\r\nfurther on the section becomes truly magnificent,--one of the finest\r\nsections of this formation exhibited anywhere in Britain, perhaps in the\r\nworld. In a ravine furrowed in the face of the declivity by the headlong\r\ndescent of a small stream, we may trace all the beds of the system in\r\nsuccession, from the Cornbrash, an upper deposit of the Lower Oolite,\r\ndown to the Lias, the formation on which the Oolite rests. The only\r\nmodifying circumstance to the geologist is, that though the sandstone\r\nbeds run continuously along the cliff for miles together, distinct as\r\nthe white bands in a piece of onyx, the intervening beds of shale are\r\nswarded over, save where we here and there see them laid bare in some\r\nabrupter acclivity or deeper water-course. In the shale we find numerous\r\nminute Ammonites, sorely weathered; in the sandstone, Belemnites, some\r\nof them of great size; and dark carbonaceous markings, passing not\r\nunfrequently into a glossy cubical coal. At the foot of the cliff I\r\npicked up an ammonite of considerable size and well-marked\r\ncharacter,--the _Ammonites Murchisonae_, first discovered on this coast\r\nby Sir R. Murchison about fifteen years ago. It measures, when full\r\ngrown, from six to seven inches in diameter; the inner whorls, which are\r\nbroadly visible, are ribbed; whereas the two, and sometimes the three\r\nouter ones, are smooth,--a marked characteristic of the species. My\r\nspecimen merely enabled me to examine the peculiarities of the shell\r\njust a little more minutely than I could have done in the pages of\r\nSowerby; for such was its state of decay, that it fell to pieces in my\r\nhands. I had now come full in view of the rocky island of Holm, when the\r\naltered appearance of the heavens led me to deliberate, just as I was\r\nwarming in the work of exploration, whether, after all, it might not be\r\nwell to scale the cliffs, and strike directly on the inn. It was nearly\r\nthree o'clock; the sky had been gradually darkening since noon, as if\r\none thin covering of gauze after another had been drawn over it; hill\r\nand island had first dimmed and then disappeared in the landscape; and\r\nnow the sun stood up right over the fast-contracting vista of the Sound,\r\nround and lightless as the moon in a haze; and the downward\r\ncataract-like streaming of the gray vapor on the horizon showed that\r\nthere the rain had already broken, and was descending in torrents. We\r\nhad been thirsty in the hot sun, and had found the springs few and\r\nscanty; but the boy now assured me, in very broken English, that we were\r\nto get a great deal more water than would be good for us, and that it\r\nmight be advisable to get out of its way. And so, climbing to the top of\r\nthe cliffs, along a water-course, we reached the ridge, just as the fog\r\ncame rolling downwards from the peaked brow of the Storr into the flat\r\nmoory valley, and the melancholy lochans roughened and darkened in the\r\nrain. We were both particularly wet ere we reached Portree.\r\n\r\nIn exploring our Scotch formations, I have had frequent occasion, in\r\nRoss, Sutherland, Caithness, and now once more in Skye, to pass over\r\nground described by Sir R. Murchison; and in every instance have I found\r\nmyself immensely his debtor. His descriptions possess the merit of being\r\ntrue: they are simple outlines often, that leave much to be filled up by\r\nafter discovery; but, like those outlines of the skilful geographer that\r\nfix the place of some island or strait, though they may not entirely\r\ndefine it, they always indicate the exact position in the scale of the\r\nformations to which they refer. They leave a good deal to be done in the\r\nway of mapping out the interior of a deposit, if I may so speak; but\r\nthey leave nothing to be done in the way of ascertaining its place. The\r\nwork accomplished is _bona fide_ work,--actual, solid, not to be done\r\nover again,--work such as could be achieved in only the school of Dr.\r\nWilliam Smith, the father of English Geology. I have found much to\r\nadmire, too, in the sections of Sir R. Murchison. His section of this\r\npart of the coast, for example, strikes from the extreme northern part\r\nof Skye to the island of Holm, thence to Scrapidale in Rasay, thence\r\nalong part of the coast of Scalpa, thence direct through the middle of\r\nPabba, and thence to the shore of the Bay of Laig. The line thus taken\r\nincludes, in regular sequence in the descending order, the whole Oolitic\r\ndeposits of the Hebrides, from the Cornbrash, with its overlying\r\nfresh-water outliers of mayhap the Weald, down to where the Lower Lias\r\nrests on the primary red sandstones of Sleat. It would have cost\r\nM'Culloch less exploration to have written a volume than it must have\r\ncost Sir R. Murchison to draw this single line; but the line once drawn,\r\nis work done to the hands of all after explorers. I have followed\r\nrepeatedly in the track of another geologist, of, however, a very\r\ndifferent school, who explored, at a comparatively recent period, the\r\ndeposits of not a few of our Scotch counties. But his labors, in at\r\nleast the fossiliferous formations, seem to have accomplished nothing\r\nfor Geology,--I am afraid, even less than nothing. So far as they had\r\ninfluence at all, it must have been to throw back the science. A\r\ngeologist who could have asserted only three years ago (\"Geognostical\r\nAccount of Banffshire,\" 1842), that the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland\r\nforms merely \"a part of the great coal deposit,\" could have known\r\nmarvellously little of the fossils of the one system, and nothing\r\nwhatever of those of the other. Had he examined ere he decided, instead\r\nof deciding without any intention of examining, he would have found\r\nthat, while both systems abound in organic remains, they do not possess,\r\nin Scotland at least, a single species in common, and that even their\r\ntypes of being, viewed in the group, are essentially distinct.\r\n\r\nThe three Edinburgh gentlemen whom I had met at breakfast were still in\r\nthe inn. One of them I had seen before, as one of the guests at a\r\nWesleyan soiree, though I saw he failed to remember that I had been\r\nthere as a guest too. The two other gentlemen were altogether strangers\r\nto me. One of them,--a man on the right side of forty, and a superb\r\nspecimen of the powerful, six-feet two-inch Norman Celt,--I set down as\r\na scion of some old Highland family, who, as the broadsword had gone\r\nout, carried on the internal wars of the country with the formidable\r\nartillery of Statute and Decision. The other, a gentleman more advanced\r\nin life, I predicated to be a Highland proprietor, the uncle of the\r\nyounger of the two,--a man whose name, as he had an air of business\r\nabout him, occurred, in all probability, in the Almanac, in the list of\r\nScotch advocates. Both were of course high Tories,--I was quite sure of\r\nthat,--zealous in behalf of the Establishment, though previous to the\r\nDisruption they had not cared for it a pin's point,--and prepared to\r\njustify the virtual suppression of the toleration laws in the case of\r\nthe Free Church. I was thus decidedly guilty of what old Dr. More calls\r\na _prosopolepsia_,--_i.e._ of the crime of judging men by their looks.\r\nAt dinner, however, we gradually ate ourselves into conversation: we\r\ndiffered, and disputed, and agreed, and then differed, disputed and\r\nagreed again. I found first, that my chance companions were really not\r\nvery high Tories; and then, that they were not Tories at all; and then,\r\nthat the younger of the two was very much a Whig, and the more advanced\r\nin life,--strange as the fact might seem,--very considerably a\r\n_Presbyterian_ Whig; and finally, that this latter gentleman, whom I had\r\nset down as an intolerant Highland proprietor, was a respected writer to\r\nthe signet, a Free Church elder in Edinburgh; and that the other, his\r\nequally intolerant nephew, was an Edinburgh advocate, of vigorous\r\ntalent, much an enemy of all oppression, and a brother contributor of my\r\nown to one of the Quarterlies. Of all my surmisings regarding the\r\nstranger gentlemen, only two points held true,--they were both\r\ngentlemen of the law, and both had Celtic blood in their veins. The\r\nevening passed pleasantly; and I can now recommend from experience, to\r\nthe hapless traveller who gets thoroughly wet thirty miles from a change\r\nof dress, that some of the best things he can resort to in the\r\ncircumstances are, a warm room, a warm glass, and agreeable companions.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow I behooved to return to Isle Ornsay, to set out on the\r\nfollowing day, with my friend the minister, for Rum, where he purposed\r\npreaching on the Sabbath. To have lost a day would have been to lose the\r\nopportunity of exploring the island, perhaps forever; and, to make all\r\nsure, I had taken a seat in the mail gig, from the postman who drives\r\nit, ere going to bed, on the morning of my arrival; and now, when it\r\ndrove up, I went to take my place in it. The postmaster of the village,\r\na lean, hungry-looking man, interfered to prevent me. I had secured my\r\nseat, I said, two days previous. Ah, but I had not secured it from him.\r\n\"I know nothing of you,\" I replied; \"but I secured it from one who\r\ndeemed himself authorized to receive the fare; was he so?\" \"Yes.\" \"Could\r\nyou have received it?\" \"No.\" \"Show me a copy of your regulations.\" \"I\r\nhave no copy of regulations; but I have given the place in the gig to\r\nanother.\" \"Just so; and what say you, postman?\" \"That you took the place\r\nfrom me, and that _he_ has no right to give a place to any one: I carry\r\nthe Portree letters to him, but he has nothing to do with the\r\npassengers.\" A person present, the proprietor or stabler of the horse, I\r\nbelieve, also interfered on the same side; but what Carlyle terms the\r\n\"gigmanity\" of the postmaster was all at stake,--his whole influence in\r\nthe mail-gig of Portree; and so he argued, and threatened withal, and,\r\nwhat was the more serious part of the business, the person he had given\r\nthe seat to had taken possession of the gig; and so we had to compound\r\nthe matter by carrying a passenger additional. The incident is scarce\r\nworth relating; but the postmaster was so vehement and terrible, so\r\ndefiant of us all,--post, stabler, and simple passenger,--and so justly\r\nimpressed with the importance of being postmaster of Portree, that, as I\r\nam in the way of describing rare specimens at any rate, I must refer to\r\nhim among the rest, as if he had been one of the minor carnivorae of a\r\nSkye deposit,--a cuttlefish, that preyed on the weaker molluscs, or a\r\nhungry polypus, terrible among the animalculae.\r\n\r\nWe drove heavily, and had to dismount and walk afoot over every steeper\r\nacclivity; but I carried my hammer, and only grieved that in some one or\r\ntwo localities the road should have been so level. I regretted it in\r\nespecial on the southern and eastern side of Loch Sligachan, where I\r\ncould see from my seat, as we drove past, the dark blue rocks in the\r\nwater-courses on each side the road, studded over with that\r\ncharacteristic shell of the Lias, the _Gryphaea incurva_, and that the\r\ndry-stone fences in the moor above exhibit fossils that might figure in\r\na museum. But we rattled by. At Broadford, twenty-five miles from\r\nPortree, and nine miles from Isle Ornsay, I partook of a hospitable meal\r\nin the house of an acquaintance; and in little more than two hours after\r\nwas with my friend the minister at Isle Ornsay. The night wore\r\npleasantly by. Mrs. Swanson, a niece of the late Dr. Smith of\r\nCampbelton, so well known for his Celtic researches and his exquisite\r\ntranslations of ancient Celtic poetry, I found deeply versed in the\r\nlegendary lore of the Highlands. The minister showed me a fine specimen\r\nof Pterichthys which I had disinterred for him, out of my first\r\ndiscovered fossiliferous deposit of the Old Red Sandstone, exactly\r\nthirteen years before, and full seven years ere I had introduced the\r\ncreature to the notice of Agassiz. And the minister's daughter, a\r\nlittle chubby girl of three summers, taking part in the general\r\nentertainment, strove to make her Gaelic sound as like English as she\r\ncould, in my especial behalf. I remembered, as I listened to the\r\nunintelligible prattle of the little thing, unprovided with a word of\r\nEnglish, that just eighteen years before, her father had had no Gaelic;\r\nand wondered what he would have thought, could he have been told, when\r\nhe first sat down to study it, the story of his island charge in Eigg,\r\nand his Free Church yacht the Betsey. Nineteen years before, we had been\r\nengaged in beating over the Eathie Lias together, collecting Belemnites,\r\nAmmonites, and fossil wood, and striving in friendly emulation the one\r\nto surpass the other in the variety and excellence of our specimens. Our\r\nleisure hours were snatched, at the time, from college studies by the\r\none, from the mallet by the other: there were few of them that we did\r\nnot spend together, and that we were not mutually the better for so\r\nspending. I at least, owe much to these hours,--among other things,\r\nviews of theologic truth, that determined the side I have taken in our\r\necclesiastical controversy. Our courses at an after period lay diverse;\r\nthe young minister had greatly more important business to pursue than\r\nany which the geologic field furnishes; and so our amicable rivalry\r\nceased early. In the words in which an English poet addresses his\r\nbrother,--the clergyman who sat for the picture in the \"Deserted\r\nVillage,\"--my friend \"entered on a sacred office, where the harvest is\r\ngreat and the laborers are few, and left to me a field in which the\r\nlaborers are many, and the harvest scarce worth carrying away.\"\r\n\r\nNext day at noon we weighed anchor, and stood out for Rum, a run of\r\nabout twenty-five miles. A kind friend had, we found, sent aboard in our\r\nbehalf two pieces of rare antiquity,--rare anywhere, but especially\r\nrare in the lockers of the Betsey,--in the agreeable form of two bottles\r\nof semi-fossil Madeira,--Madeira that had actually existed in the grape\r\nexactly half a century before, at the time when Robespierre was\r\nstartling Paris from its propriety, by mutilating at the neck the busts\r\nof other people, and multiplying casts and medals of his own; and we\r\nfound it, explored in moderation, no bad study for geologists,\r\nespecially in coarse weather, when they had got wet and somewhat\r\nfatigued. It was like Landlord Boniface's ale, mild as milk, had\r\nexchanged its distinctive flavor as Madeira for a better one, and filled\r\nthe cabin with fragrance every time the cork was drawn. Old observant\r\nHomer must have smelt some such liquor somewhere, or he could never have\r\ndescribed so well the still more ancient and venerable wine with which\r\nwily Ulysses beguiled one-eyed Polypheme:--\r\n\r\n                       \"Unmingled wine,\r\n Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine,\r\n Which now, some ages from his race concealed,\r\n The hoary sire in gratitude revealed....\r\n Scarce twenty measures from the living stream\r\n To cool one cup sufficed: the goblet crowned,\r\n Breathed aromatic fragrances around.\"\r\n\r\nWinds were light and variable. As we reached the middle of the sound\r\nopposite Armadale, there fell a dead calm; and the Betsey, more actively\r\nidle than the ship manned by the Ancient Mariner, dropped sternwards\r\nalong the tide, to the dull music of the flapping sail. The minister\r\nspent the day in the cabin, engaged with his discourse for the morrow;\r\nand I, that he might suffer as little from interruption as possible,\r\n_mis_-spent it upon the deck. I tried fishing with the yacht's set of\r\nlines, but there were no fish to bite,--got into the boat, but there\r\nwere no neighboring islands to visit,--and sent half a dozen\r\npistol-bullets after a shoal of porpoises, which, coming from the Free\r\nChurch yacht, must have astonished the fat sleek fellows pretty\r\nconsiderably, but did them, I am afraid, no serious damage. As the\r\nevening began to close gloomy and gray, a tumbling swell came heaving in\r\nright ahead from the west; and a bank of cloud, which had been gradually\r\nrising higher and darker over the horizon in the same direction, first\r\nchanged its abrupt edge atop for a diffused and broken line, and then\r\nspread itself over the central heavens. The calm was evidently not to be\r\na calm long; and the minister issued orders that the gaff-topsail should\r\nbe taken down, and the storm-jib bent; and that we should lower our\r\ntopmast, and have all tight and ready for a smart gale ahead. At half\r\npast ten, however, the Betsey was still pitching to the swell, with not\r\na breath of wind to act on the diminished canvas, and with the solitary\r\ncircumstance in her favor, that the tide ran no longer against her, as\r\nbefore. The cabin was full of all manner of creakings; the close lamp\r\nswung to and fro over the head of my friend; and a refractory\r\nConcordance, after having twice travelled from him along the entire\r\nlength of the table, flung itself pettishly upon the floor. I got into\r\nmy snug bed about eleven; and at twelve, the minister, after poring\r\nsufficiently over his notes, and drawing the final score, turned into\r\nhis. In a brief hour after, on came the gale, in a style worthy of its\r\nprevious hours of preparation; and my friend,--his Saturday's work in\r\nhis ministerial capacity well over when he had completed his two\r\ndiscourses,--had to begin the Sabbath morning early as the morning\r\nitself began, by taking his stand at the helm, in his capacity of\r\nskipper of the Betsey. With the prospect of the services of the Sabbath\r\nbefore him, and after working all Saturday to boot, it was rather hard\r\nto set him down to a midnight spell at the helm, but he could not be\r\nwanted at such a time, as we had no other such helmsman aboard. The\r\ngale, thickened with rain, came down, shrieking like a maniac, from off\r\nthe peaked hills of Rum, striking away the tops of the long ridgy\r\nbillows that had risen in the calm to indicate its approach, and then\r\ncarrying them in sheets of spray aslant the furrowed surface, like\r\nsnow-drift hurried across a frozen field. But the Betsey, with her\r\nstorm-jib set, and her mainsail reefed to the cross, kept her weather\r\nbow bravely to the blast, and gained on it with every tack. She had been\r\nthe pleasure yacht, in her day, of a man of fortune, who had used, in\r\nrunning south with her at times as far as Lisbon, to encounter, on not\r\nworse terms than the stateliest of her neighbors in the voyage, the\r\nswell of the Bay of Biscay; and she still kept true to her old\r\ncharacter, with but this drawback, that she had now got somewhat crazy\r\nin her fastenings, and made rather more water in a heavy sea than her\r\none little pump could conveniently keep under. As the fitful gust struck\r\nher headlong, as if it had been some invisible missile hurled at us from\r\noff the hill-tops, she stooped her head lower and lower, like old\r\nstately Hardyknute under the blow of the \"King of Norse,\" till at length\r\nthe lee chain-plate rustled sharp through the foam; but, like a staunch\r\nFree Churchwoman, the lowlier she bent, the more steadfastly did she\r\nhold her head to the storm. The strength of the opposition served but to\r\nspeed her on all the more surely to the desired haven. At five o'clock\r\nin the morning we cast anchor in Loch Scresort,--the only harbor of Rum\r\nin which a vessel can moor,--within two hundred yards of the shore,\r\nhaving, with the exception of the minister, gained no loss in the gale.\r\nHe, luckless man, had parted from his excellent _sou-wester_; a sudden\r\ngust had seized it by the flap, and hurried it away far to the lee. He\r\nhad yielded it to the winds, as he had done the temporalities, but much\r\nmore unwillingly, and less as a free agent. Should any conscientious\r\nmariner pick up any where in the Atlantic a serviceable ochre-colored\r\n_sou-wester_, not at all the worse for the wear, I give him to wit that\r\nhe holds Free Church property, and that he is heartily welcome to hold\r\nit, leaving it to himself to consider whether a benefaction to its full\r\nvalue, deducting salvage, is not owing, in honor, to the Sustenation\r\nFund.\r\n\r\nIt was ten o'clock ere the more fatigued aboard could muster resolution\r\nenough to quit their beds a second time; and then it behooved the\r\nminister to prepare for his Sabbath labors ashore. The gale still blew\r\nin fierce gusts from the hills, and the rain pattered like small shot on\r\nthe deck. Loch Scresort, by no means one of our finer island lochs,\r\nviewed under any circumstances, looked particularly dismal this morning.\r\nIt forms the opening of a dreary moorland valley, bounded on one of its\r\nsides, to the mouth of the loch, by a homely ridge of Old Red Sandstone,\r\nand on the other by a line of dark augitic hills, that attain, at the\r\ndistance of about a mile from the sea, an elevation of two thousand\r\nfeet. Along the slopes of the sandstone ridge I could discern, through\r\nthe haze, numerous green patches, that had once supported a dense\r\npopulation, long since \"cleared off\" to the backwoods of America, but\r\nnot one inhabited dwelling; while along a black moory acclivity under\r\nthe hills on the other side I could see several groups of turf cottages,\r\nwith here and there a minute speck of raw-looking corn beside them,\r\nthat, judging from its color, seemed to have but a slight chance of\r\nripening. The hill-tops were lost in cloud and storm; and ever and anon,\r\nas a heavier shower came sweeping down on the wind, the intervening\r\nhollows closed up their gloomy vistas, and all was fog and rime to the\r\nwater's edge. Bad as the morning was, however, we could see the people\r\nwending their way, in threes and fours, through the dark moor, to the\r\nplace of worship,--a black turf hovel, like the meeting-house in Eigg.\r\nThe appearance of the Betsey in the loch had been the gathering signal;\r\nand the Free Church islanders,--three-fourths of the entire\r\npopulation--had all come out to meet their minister.\r\n\r\nOn going ashore, we found the place nearly filled. My friend preached\r\ntwo long energetic discourses, and then returned to the yacht, \"a worn\r\nand weary man.\" The studies of the previous day, and the fatigues of the\r\nprevious night, added to his pulpit duties, had so fairly prostrated his\r\nstrength, that the sternest teetotaller in the kingdom would scarce have\r\nforbidden him a glass of our fifty-year-old Madeira. But even the\r\nfifty-year-old Madeira proved no specific in the case. He was suffering\r\nunder excruciating headache, and had to stretch himself in his bed, with\r\neyes shut but sleepless, waiting till the fit should pass,--every pulse\r\nthat beat in his temples a throb of pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     Geology of Rum--Its curious Character illustrated--Rum famous for\r\n     Bloodstones--Red Sandstones--\"Scratchings\" in the Rocks--A\r\n     Geological Inscription without a Key--The Lizard--Vitality broken\r\n     into two--Illustrations--Speculation--Scuir More--Ascent of the\r\n     Scuir--The Bloodstones--An Illustrative Set of the Gem--M'Culloch's\r\n     Pebble--A Chemical Problem--The solitary Shepherd's House--Sheep\r\n     _versus_ Men--The Depopulation of Rum--A Haul of Trout--Rum Mode of\r\n     catching Trout--At Anchor in the Bay of Glenelg.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geology of the island of Rum is simple, but curious. Let the reader\r\ntake, if he can, from twelve to fifteen trap-hills, varying from one\r\nthousand to two thousand three hundred feet in height; let him pack them\r\nclosely and squarely together, like rum-bottles in a case-basket; let\r\nhim surround them with a frame of Old Red Sandstone, measuring rather\r\nmore than seven miles on the side, in the way the basket surrounds the\r\nbottles; then let him set them down in the sea a dozen miles off the\r\nland,--and he shall have produced a second island of Rum, similar in\r\nstructure to the existing one. In the actual island, however, there is a\r\ndefect in the inclosing basket of sandstone: the basket, complete on\r\nthree of its sides, wants the fourth: and the side opposite to the gap\r\nwhich the fourth should have occupied is thicker than the two other\r\nsides put together. Where I now write there is an old dark-colored\r\npicture on the wall before me. I take off one of the four bars of which\r\nthe frame is composed,--the end-bar,--and stick it on to the end-bar\r\nopposite, and then the picture is fully framed on two of its sides, and\r\ndoubly framed on a third, but the fourth side lacks framing altogether.\r\nAnd such is the geology of the island of Rum. We find the one loch of\r\nthe island,--that in which the Betsey lies at anchor,--and the long\r\nwithdrawing valley, of which the loch is merely a prolongation,\r\noccurring in the double sandstone bar: it seems to mark--to return to my\r\nillustration--the line in which the superadded piece of frame has been\r\nstuck on to the frame proper. The origin of the island is illustrated by\r\nits structure: it has left its story legibly written, and we have but to\r\nrun our eye over the characters and read. An extended sea-bottom,\r\ncomposed of Old Red Sandstone, already tilted up by previous\r\nconvulsions, so that the strata presented their edges, tier beyond tier,\r\nlike roofing slate laid aslant on a floor, became a centre of Plutonic\r\nactivity. The molten trap broke through at various times, and presenting\r\nvarious appearances, but in nearly the same centre; here existing as an\r\naugitic rock, there as a syenite, yonder as a basalt or amygdaloid. At\r\none place it uptilted the sandstone; at another it overflowed it; the\r\ndark central masses raised their heads above the surface, higher and\r\nhigher with every earthquake throe from beneath; till at length the\r\ngigantic Ben More attained to its present altitude of two thousand three\r\nhundred feet over the sea-level, and the sandstone, borne up from\r\nbeneath like floating sea-wrack on the back of a porpoise, reached in\r\nlong outside bands its elevation of from six to eight hundred. And such\r\nis the piece of history, composed in silent but expressive language, and\r\ninscribed in the old geological character, on the rocks of Rum.\r\n\r\nThe wind lowered and the rain ceased during the night, and the morning\r\nof Monday was clear, bracing, and breezy. The island of Rum is chiefly\r\nfamous among mineralogists for its heliotropes or bloodstones; and we\r\nproposed devoting the greater part of the day to an examination of the\r\nhill of Scuir More, in which they occur, and which lies on the opposite\r\nside of the island, about eight miles from the mooring ground of the\r\nBetsey. Ere setting out, however, I found time enough, by rising some\r\ntwo or three hours before breakfast, to explore the Red Sandstones on\r\nthe southern side of the loch. They lie in this bar of the frame,--to\r\nreturn once more to my old illustration,--as if it had been cut out of a\r\npiece of cross-grained deal, in which the annular bands, instead of\r\nranging lengthwise, ran diagonally from side to side; stratum leans over\r\nstratum, dipping towards the west at an angle of about thirty degrees;\r\nand as in a continuous line of more than seven miles there seem no\r\nbreaks or repetitions in the strata, the thickness of the deposit must\r\nbe enormous,--not less, I should suppose, than from six to eight\r\nthousand feet. Like the Lower Old Red Sandstones of Cromarty and Moray,\r\nthe red arenaceous strata occur in thick beds, separated from each other\r\nby bands of a grayish-colored stratified clay, on the planes of which I\r\ncould trace with great distinctness ripple markings; but in vain did I\r\nexplore their numerous folds for the plates, scales, and fucoid\r\nimpressions which abound in the gray argillaceous beds of the shores of\r\nthe Moray and Cromarty Friths. It would, however, be rash to pronounce\r\nthem non-fossiliferous, after the hasty search of a single\r\nmorning,--unpardonably so in one who had spent very many mornings in\r\nputting to the question the gray stratified beds of Ross and Cromarty,\r\nere he succeeded in extorting from them the secret of their organic\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nWe set out about half-past ten for Scuir More, through the Red Sandstone\r\nvalley in which Loch Scresort terminates, with one of Mr. Swanson's\r\npeople, a young active lad of twenty, for our guide. In passing upwards\r\nfor nearly a mile along the stream that falls into the upper part of the\r\nloch, and lays bare the strata, we saw no change in the character of\r\nthe sandstone. Red arenaceous beds of great thickness alternate with\r\ngrayish-colored bands, composed of a ripple-marked micaceous slate and a\r\nstratified clay. For a depth of full three thousand feet, and I know not\r\nhow much more,--for I lacked time to trace it further,--the deposit\r\npresents no other variety: the thick red bed of at least a hundred yards\r\nsucceeds the thin gray band of from three to six feet, and is succeeded\r\nby a similar gray band in turn. The ripple-marks I found as sharply\r\nrelieved in some of the folds as if the wavy undulations to which they\r\nowed their origin had passed over them within the hour. The\r\ncomparatively small size of their alternating ridges and furrows give\r\nevidence that the waters beneath which they had formed had been of no\r\nvery profound depth. In the upper part of the valley, which is bare,\r\ntrackless, and solitary, with a high monotonous sandstone ridge bounding\r\nit on the one side, and a line of gloomy trap-hills rising over it on\r\nthe other, the edges of the strata, where they protrude through the\r\nmingled heath and moss, exhibit the mysterious scratchings and\r\npolishings now so generally connected with the glacial theory of\r\nAgassiz. The scratchings run in nearly the line of the valley, which\r\nexhibits no trace of moraines; and they seem to have been produced\r\nrather by the operation of those extensively developed causes, whatever\r\ntheir nature, that have at once left their mark on the sides and summits\r\nof some of our highest hills, and the rocks and boulders of some of our\r\nmost extended plains, than by the agency of forces limited to the\r\nlocality. They testify, Agassiz would perhaps say, not regarding the\r\nexistence of some local glacier that descended from the higher grounds\r\ninto the valley, but respecting the existence of the great polar\r\nglacier. I felt, however, in this bleak and solitary hollow, with the\r\ngrooved and polished platforms at my feet, stretching away amid the\r\nheath, like flat tombstones in a graveyard, that I had arrived at one\r\ngeologic inscription to which I still wanted the key. The vesicular\r\nstructure of the traps on the one hand, identical with that of so many\r\nof our modern lavas,--the ripple-markings of the arenaceous beds on the\r\nother, indistinguishable from those of the sea-banks on our coasts,--the\r\nupturned strata and the overlying trap,--told all their several stories\r\nof fire, or wave, or terrible convulsion, and told them simply and\r\nclearly; but here was a story not clearly told. It summoned up doubtful,\r\never-shifting visions,--now of a vast ice continent, abutting on this\r\nfar isle of the Hebrides from the Pole, and trampling heavily over\r\nit,--now of the wild rush of a turbid, mountain-high flood breaking in\r\nfrom the west, and hurling athwart the torn surface, rocks, and stones,\r\nand clay,--now of a dreary ocean rising high along the hills, and\r\nbearing onward with its winds and currents, huge icebergs, that now\r\nbrushed the mountain-sides, and now grated along the bottom of the\r\nsubmerged valleys. The inscription on the polished surfaces, with its\r\ncareless mixture of groove and scratch, is an inscription of very\r\nvarious readings.\r\n\r\nWe passed along a transverse hollow, and then began to ascend a\r\nhill-side, from the ridge of which the water sheds to the opposite shore\r\nof the island, and on which we catch our first glimpse of Scuir More,\r\nstanding up over the sea, like a pyramid shorn of its top. A brown\r\nlizard, nearly five inches in length, startled by our approach, ran\r\nhurriedly across the path; and our guide, possessed by the general\r\nHighland belief that the creature is poisonous, and injures cattle,\r\nstruck at it with a switch, and cut it in two immediately behind the\r\nhinder legs. The upper half, containing all that anatomists regard as\r\nthe vitals, heart, brain, and viscera, all the main nerves, and all the\r\nlarger arteries, lay stunned by the blow, as if dead; nor did it\r\nmanifest any signs of vitality so long as we remained beside it; whereas\r\nthe lower half, as if the whole life of the animal had retired into\r\n_it_, continued dancing upon the moss for a full minute after, like a\r\nyoung eel scooped out of some stream, and thrown upon the bank; and then\r\nlay wriggling and palpitating for about half a minute more. There are\r\nfew things more inexplicable in the province of the naturalist than the\r\nphenomenon of what may be termed divided life,--vitality broken into\r\ntwo, and yet continuing to exist as vitality in both the dissevered\r\npieces. We see in the nobler animals mere glimpses of the\r\nphenomenon,--mere indications of it, doubtfully apparent for at most a\r\nfew minutes. The blood drawn from the human arm by the lancet continues\r\nto live in the cup until it has cooled and begun to coagulate; and when\r\nhead and body have parted company under the guillotine, both exhibit for\r\na brief space such unequivocal signs of life, that the question arose in\r\nFrance during the horrors of the Revolution, whether there might not be\r\nsome glimmering of consciousness attendant at the same time on the\r\nfearfully opening and shutting eyes and mouth of the one, and the\r\nbeating heart and jerking neck of the other. The lower we descend in the\r\nscale of being, the more striking the instances which we receive of this\r\ndivisibility of the vital principle. I have seen the two halves of the\r\nheart of a ray pulsating for a full quarter of an hour after they had\r\nbeen separated from the body and from each other. The blood circulates\r\nin the hind leg of a frog for many minutes after the removal of the\r\nheart, which meanwhile keeps up an independent motion of its own.\r\nVitality can be so divided in the earthworm, that, as demonstrated by\r\nthe experiments of Spalanzani, each of the severed parts carries life\r\nenough away to set it up as an independent animal; while the polypus, a\r\ncreature of still more imperfect organization, and with the vivacious\r\nprinciple more equally diffused over it, may be multiplied by its pieces\r\nnearly as readily as a gooseberry bush by its slips. It was sufficiently\r\ncurious, however, to see, in the case of this brown lizard, the least\r\nvital half of the creature so much more vivacious, apparently, than the\r\nhalf which contained the heart and brain. It is not improbable, however,\r\nthat the presence of these organs had only the effect of rendering the\r\nupper portion which contained them more capable of being thrown into a\r\nstate of insensibility. A blow dealt one of the vertebrata on the head\r\nat once renders it insensible. It is after this mode the fisherman kills\r\nthe salmon captured in his wear, and a single blow, when well directed,\r\nis always sufficient; but no single blow has the same effect on the\r\nearthworm; and here it was vitality in the inferior portion of the\r\nreptile,--the earthworm portion of it, if I may so speak,--that refused\r\nto participate in the state of syncope into which the vitality of the\r\nsuperior portion had been thrown. The nice and delicate vitality of the\r\nbrain seems to impart to the whole system in connection with it an\r\naptitude for dying suddenly,--a susceptibility of instant death, which\r\nwould be wanting without it. The heart of the rabbit continues to beat\r\nregularly long after the brain has been removed by careful excision, if\r\nrespiration be artificially kept up; but if, instead of amputating the\r\nhead, the brain be crushed in its place by a sudden blow of a hammer,\r\nthe heart ceases its motion at once. And such seemed to be the principle\r\nillustrated here. But why the agonized dancing on the sward of the\r\ninferior part of the reptile?--why its after painful writhing and\r\nwriggling? The young eel scooped from the stream, whose motions it\r\nresembled, is impressed by terror, and can feel pain; was _it_ also\r\nimpressed by terror, or susceptible of suffering? We see in the case of\r\nboth exactly the same signs,--the dancing, the writhing, the wriggling;\r\nbut are we to interpret them after the same manner? In the small\r\nred-headed earthworm divided by Spalanzani, that in three months got\r\nupper extremities to its lower part, and lower extremities, in as many\r\nweeks, to its upper part, the dividing blow must have dealt duplicate\r\nfeelings,--pain and terror to the portion below, and pain and terror to\r\nthe portion above,--so far, at least, as a creature so low in the scale\r\nwas susceptible of these feelings; but are we to hold that the leaping,\r\nwriggling tail of the reptile possessed in any degree a similar\r\nsusceptibility? _I_ can propound the riddle, but who shall resolve it?\r\nIt may be added, that this brown lizard was the only recent saurian I\r\nchanced to see in the Hebrides, and that, though large for its kind, its\r\nwhole bulk did not nearly equal that of a single vertebral joint of the\r\nfossil saurians of Eigg. The reptile, since his deposition from the\r\nfirst place in the scale of creation, has sunk sadly in those parts: the\r\nex-monarch has become a low plebeian.\r\n\r\nWe came down upon the coast through a swampy valley, terminating in the\r\ninterior in a frowning wall of basalt, and bounded on the south, where\r\nit opens to the sea, by the Scuir More. The Scuir is a precipitous\r\nmountain, that rises from twelve to fifteen hundred feet direct over the\r\nbeach. M'Culloch describes it as inaccessible, and states that it is\r\nonly among the debris at its base that its heliotropes can be procured;\r\nbut the distinguished mineralogist must have had considerably less skill\r\nin climbing rocks than in describing them, as, indeed, some of his\r\ndescriptions, though generally very admirable, abundantly testify. I am\r\ninclined to infer from his book, after having passed over much of the\r\nground which he describes, that he must have been a man of the type so\r\nwell hit off by Burns in his portrait of Captain Grose,--round, rosy,\r\nshort-legged, quick of eye but slow of foot, quite as indifferent a\r\nclimber as Bailie Nicol Jarvie, and disposed at times, like the elderly\r\ngentleman drawn by Crabbe, to prefer the view at the hill-foot to the\r\nprospect from its summit. I found little difficulty in scaling the sides\r\nof Scuir More for a thousand feet upwards,--in one part by a route\r\nrarely attempted before,--and in ensconcing myself among the\r\nbloodstones. They occur in the amygdaloidal trap of which the upper part\r\nof the hill is mainly composed, in great numbers, and occasionally in\r\nbulky masses; but it is rare to find other than small specimens that\r\nwould be recognized as of value by the lapidary. The inclosing rock must\r\nhave been as thickly vesicular in its original state as the scoria of a\r\nglass-house; and all the vesicles, large and small, like the retorts and\r\nreceivers of a laboratory, have been vessels in which some curious\r\nchemical process has been carried on. Many of them we find filled with a\r\nwhite semi-translucent or opaque chalcedony; many more with a pure green\r\nearth, which, where exposed to the bleaching influences of the weather,\r\nexhibits a fine verdigris hue, but which in the fresh fracture is\r\ngenerally of an olive green, or of a brownish or reddish color. I have\r\nnever yet seen a rock in which this earth was so abundant as in the\r\namygdaloid of Scuir More. For yards together in some places we see it\r\nprojecting from the surface in round globules, that very much resemble\r\ngreen peas, and that occur as thickly in the inclosing mass as pebbles\r\nin an Old Red Sandstone conglomerate. The heliotrope has formed among it\r\nin centres, to which the chalcedony seems to have been drawn, as if by\r\nmolecular attraction. We find a mass, varying from the size of a walnut\r\nto that of a man's head, occupying some larger vesicle or crevice of the\r\namygdaloid, and all the smaller vesicles around it, for an inch or two,\r\nfilled with what we may venture to term satellite heliotropes, some of\r\nthem as minute as grains of wild mustard, and all of them more or less\r\nearthy, generally in proportion to their distance from the first formed\r\nheliotrope in the middle. No one can see them in their place in the\r\nrock, with the abundant green earth all around, and the chalcedony, in\r\nits uncolored state, filling up so many of the larger cavities, without\r\nacquiescing in the conclusion respecting the origin of the gem first\r\nsuggested by Werner, and afterwards adopted and illustrated by\r\nM'Culloch. The heliotrope is merely a chalcedony, stained in the forming\r\nwith an infusion of green earth, as the colored waters in the\r\napothecary's window are stained by the infusions, vegetable and mineral,\r\nfrom which they derive their ornamental character. The red mottlings\r\nwhich so heighten the beauty of the stone occur in comparatively few of\r\nthe specimens of Scuir More. They are minute jasperous formations,\r\nindependent of the inclosing mass; and, from their resemblance to\r\nstreaks and spots of blood, suggest the name by which the heliotrope is\r\npopularly known. I succeeded in making up, among the crags, a set of\r\nspecimens curiously illustrative of the origin of the gem. One specimen\r\nconsists of white, uncolored chalcedony; a second, of a rich\r\nverdigris-hued green earth; a third, of chalcedony barely tinged with\r\ngreen; a fourth, of chalcedony tinged just a shade more deeply; a fifth,\r\ntinged more deeply still; a sixth, of a deep green on one side, and\r\nscarce at all colored on the other; and a seventh, dark and richly\r\ntoned,--a true bloodstone,--thickly streaked and mottled with red\r\njasper. In the chemical process that rendered the Scuir More a mountain\r\nof gems there were two deteriorating circumstances, which operated to\r\nthe disadvantage of its larger heliotropes: the green earth, as if\r\ninsufficiently stirred in the mixing, has gathered, in many of them,\r\ninto minute soft globules, like air-bubbles in glass, that render them\r\nvalueless for the purposes of the lapidary, by filling them all over\r\nwith little cavities; and in not a few of the others, an infiltration of\r\nlime, that refused to incorporate with the chalcedonic mass, exists in\r\nthin glassy films and veins, that, from their comparative softness, have\r\na nearly similar effect with the impalpable green earth in roughing the\r\nsurface under the burnisher.\r\n\r\nWe find figured by M'Culloch, in his \"Western Islands,\" the internal\r\ncavity of a pebble of Scuir More, which he picked up on the beach below,\r\nand which had been formed evidently within one of the larger vesicles of\r\nthe amygdaloid. He describes it as curiously illustrative of a various\r\nchemistry; the outer crust is composed of a pale-zoned agate, inclosing\r\na cavity, from the upper side of which there depends a group of\r\nchalcedonic stalactites, some of them, as in ancient spar caves,\r\nreaching to the floor; and bearing on its under side a large crystal of\r\ncarbonate of lime, that the longer stalactites pass through. In the\r\nvesicle in which this hollow pebble was formed three consecutive\r\nprocesses must have gone on. First, a process of infiltration coated the\r\ninterior all around with layer after layer, now of one mineral\r\nsubstance, now of another, as a plasterer coats over the sides and\r\nceiling of a room with successive layers of lime, putty, and stucco; and\r\nhad this process gone on, the whole cell would have been filled with a\r\npale-zoned agate. But it ceased, and a new process began. A chalcedonic\r\ninfiltration gradually entered from above; and, instead of coating over\r\nthe walls, roof, and floor, it hardened into a group of spear-like\r\nstalactites, that lengthened by slow degrees, till some of them had\r\ntraversed the entire cavity from top to bottom. And then this second\r\nprocess ceased like the first, and a third commenced. An infiltration\r\nof lime took place; and the minute calcareous molecules, under the\r\ninfluence of the law of crystallization, built themselves up on the\r\nfloor into a large smooth-sided rhomb, resembling a closed sarcophagus\r\nresting in the middle of some Egyptian cemetery. And then, the limestone\r\ncrystal completed, there ensued no after change. As shown by some other\r\nspecimens, however, there was a yet farther process: a pure quartzose\r\ndeposition took place, that coated not a few of the calcareous rhombs\r\nwith sprigs of rock-crystal. I found in the Scuir More several cellular\r\nagates in which similar processes had gone on,--none of them quite so\r\nfine, however, as the one figured by M'Culloch; but there seemed no lack\r\nof evidence regarding the strange and multifarious chemistry that had\r\nbeen carried on in the vesicular cavities of this mountain, as in the\r\nretorts of some vast laboratory. Here was a vesicle filled with green\r\nearth,--there a vesicle filled with calcareous spar,--yonder a vesicle\r\ncrusted round on a thin chalcedonic shell with rock-crystal,--in one\r\ncavity an agate had been elaborated, in another a heliotrope, in a third\r\na milk-white chalcedony, in a fourth a jasper. On what principle, and\r\nunder what direction, have results so various taken place in vesicles of\r\nthe same rock, that in many instances occur scarce half an inch apart?\r\nWhy, for instance, should that vesicle have elaborated only green earth,\r\nand the vesicle separated from it by a partition barely a line in\r\nthickness, have elaborated only chalcedony? Why should this chamber\r\ncontain only a quartzose compound of oxygen and silica, and that second\r\nchamber beside it contain only a calcareous compound of lime and\r\ncarbonic acid? What law directed infiltrations so diverse to seek out\r\nfor themselves vesicles in such close neighborhood, and to keep, in so\r\nmany instances, each to his own vesicle? I can but state the\r\nproblem,--not solve it. The groups of heliotropes clustered each around\r\nits bulky centrical mass seem to show that the principle of molecular\r\nattraction may be operative in very dense mediae,--in a hard amygdaloidal\r\ntrap even; and it seems not improbable, that to this law, which draws\r\natom to its kindred atom, as clansmen of old used to speed at the\r\nmustering signal to their gathering place, the various chemistry of the\r\nvesicles may owe its variety.\r\n\r\nI shall attempt stating the chemical problem furnished by the vesicles\r\nhere in a mechanical form. Let us suppose that every vesicle was a\r\nchamber furnished with a door, and that beside every door there watched,\r\nas in the draught doors of our coal-pits, some one to open and shut it,\r\nas circumstances might require. Let us suppose further, that for a\r\ncertain time an infusion of green earth pervaded the surrounding mass,\r\nand percolated through it, and that every door was opened to receive a\r\nportion of the infusion. We find that no vesicle wants its coating of\r\nthis earthy mineral. The coating received, however, one-half the doors\r\nshut, while the other half remained agap, and filled with green earth\r\nentirely. Next followed a series of alternate infusions of chalcedony,\r\njasper, and quartz; many doors opened and received some two or three\r\ncoatings, that form around the vesicles skull-like shells of agate, and\r\nthen shut; a few remained open, and became as entirely occupied with\r\nagate as many of the previous ones had become filled with green earth.\r\nThen an ample infusion of chalcedony pervaded the mass. Numerous doors\r\nagain opened; some took in a portion of the chalcedony, and then shut;\r\nsome remained open, and became filled with it; and many more that had\r\nbeen previously filled by the green earth opened their doors again, and\r\nthe chalcedony pervading the green porous mass, converted it into\r\nheliotrope. Then an infusion of lime took place. Doors opened, many of\r\nwhich had been hitherto shut, save for a short time, when the green\r\nearth infusion obtained, and became filled with lime; other doors\r\nopened for a brief space, and received lime enough to form a few\r\ncrystals. Last of all, there was a pure quartzose infusion, and doors\r\nopened, some for a longer time, some for a shorter, just as on previous\r\noccasions. Now, by mechanical means of this character,--by such an\r\narrangement of successive infusions, and such a device of shutting and\r\nopening of doors,--the phenomena exhibited by the vesicles could be\r\nproduced. There is no difficulty in working the problem mechanically, if\r\nwe be allowed to assume in our data successive infusions, well-fitted\r\ndoors, and watchful door-keepers; and if any one can work it\r\nchemically,--certainly without door-keepers, but with such doors and\r\nsuch infusions as he can show to have existed,--he shall have cleared up\r\nthe mystery of the Scuir More. I have given their various cargoes to all\r\nits many vesicles by mechanical means, at no expense of ingenuity\r\nwhatever. Are there any of my readers prepared to give it to them by\r\nmeans purely chemical?\r\n\r\nThere is a solitary house in the opening of the valley, over which the\r\nScuir More stands sentinel,--a house so solitary, that the entire\r\nbreadth of the island intervenes between it and the nearest human\r\ndwelling. It is inhabited by a shepherd and his wife,--the sole\r\nrepresentatives in the valley of a numerous population, long since\r\nexpatriated to make way for a few flocks of sheep, but whose ranges of\r\nlittle fields may still be seen green amid the heath on both sides, for\r\nnearly a mile upwards from the opening. After descending along the\r\nprecipices of the Scuir, we struck across the valley, and, on scaling\r\nthe opposite slope sat down on the summit to rest us, about a hundred\r\nyards over the house of the shepherd. He had seen us from below, when\r\nengaged among the bloodstones, and had seen, withal, that we were not\r\ncoming his way; and, \"on hospitable thoughts intent,\" he climbed to\r\nwhere we sat, accompanied by his wife, she bearing a vast bowl of milk,\r\nand he a basket of bread and cheese. And we found the refreshment most\r\nseasonable, after our long hours of toil, and with a rough journey still\r\nbefore us. It is an excellent circumstance, that hospitality grows best\r\nwhere it is most needed. In the thick of men it dwindles and disappears,\r\nlike fruits in the thick of a wood; but where man is planted sparsely,\r\nit blossoms and matures, like apples on a standard or espalier. It\r\nflourishes where the inn and the lodging-house cannot exist, and dies\r\nout where they thrive and multiply.\r\n\r\nWe reached the cross valley in the interior of the island about half an\r\nhour before sunset. The evening was clear, calm, golden-tinted; even\r\nwild heaths and rude rocks had assumed a flush of transient beauty; and\r\nthe emerald-green patches on the hill-sides, barred by the plough\r\nlengthwise, diagonally, and transverse, had borrowed an aspect of soft\r\nand velvety richness, from the mellowed light and the broadening\r\nshadows. All was solitary. We could see among the deserted fields the\r\ngrass-grown foundations of cottages razed to the ground; but the valley,\r\nmore desolate than that which we had left, had not even its single\r\ninhabited dwelling: it seemed as if man had done with it forever. The\r\nisland, eighteen years before, had been divested of its inhabitants,\r\namounting at the time to rather more than four hundred souls, to make\r\nway for one sheep-farmer and eight thousand sheep. All the aborigines of\r\nRum crossed the Atlantic; and at the close of 1828, the entire\r\npopulation consisted of but the sheep-farmer, and a few shepherds, his\r\nservants; the island of Rum reckoned up scarce a single family at this\r\nperiod for every five square miles of area which it contained. But\r\ndepopulation on so extreme a scale was found inconvenient; the place had\r\nbeen rendered too thoroughly a desert for the comfort of the occupant;\r\nand on the occasion of a clearing which took place shortly after in\r\nSkye, he accommodated some ten or twelve of the ejected families with\r\nsites for cottages, and pasturage for a few cows, on the bit of morass\r\nbeside Loch Scresort, on which I had seen their humble dwellings. But\r\nthe whole of the once-peopled interior remains a wilderness, without\r\ninhabitant,--all the more lonely in its aspect from the circumstance\r\nthat the solitary valleys, with their plough-furrowed patches, and their\r\nruined heaps of stone, open upon shores every whit as solitary as\r\nthemselves, and that the wide untrodden sea stretches drearily around.\r\nThe armies of the insect world were sporting in the light this evening\r\nby millions; a brown stream that runs through the valley yielded an\r\nincessant popling sound, from the myriads of fish that were ceaselessly\r\nleaping in the pools, beguiled by the quick glancing wings of green and\r\ngold that fluttered over them; along a distant hill-side there ran what\r\nseemed the ruins of a gray-stone fence, erected, says tradition, in a\r\nremote age, to facilitate the hunting of the deer; there were fields on\r\nwhich the heath and moss of the surrounding moorlands were fast\r\nencroaching, that had borne many a successive harvest; and prostrate\r\ncottages, that had been the scenes of christenings, and bridals, and\r\nblythe new-year's days;--all seemed to bespeak the place a fitting\r\nhabitation for man, in which not only the necessaries, but also a few of\r\nthe luxuries of life, might be procured; but in the entire prospect not\r\na man nor a man's dwelling could the eye command. The landscape was one\r\nwithout figures. I do not much like extermination carried out so\r\nthoroughly and on system;--it seems bad policy; and I have not succeeded\r\nin thinking any the better of it though assured by economists that there\r\nare more than people enough in Scotland still. There are, I believe,\r\nmore than enough in our workhouses,--more than enough on our\r\npauper-rolls,--more than enough huddled up, disreputable, useless, and\r\nunhappy, in the miasmatic alleys and typhoid courts of our large towns;\r\nbut I have yet to learn how arguments for local depopulation are to be\r\ndrawn from facts such as these. A brave and hardy people, favorably\r\nplaced for the development of all that is excellent in human nature,\r\nform the glory and strength of a country;--a people sunk into an abyss\r\nof degradation and misery, and in which it is the whole tendency of\r\nexternal circumstances to sink them yet deeper, constitute its weakness\r\nand its shame; and I cannot quite see on what principle the ominous\r\nincrease which is taking place among us in the worse class, is to form\r\nour solace or apology for the wholesale expatriation of the better. It\r\ndid not seem as if the depopulation of Rum had tended much to any one's\r\nadvantage. The single sheep-farmer who had occupied the holdings of so\r\nmany had been unfortunate in his speculations, and had left the island:\r\nthe proprietor, his landlord, seemed to have been as little fortunate as\r\nthe tenant, for the island itself was in the market; and a report went\r\ncurrent at the time, that it was on the eve of being purchased by some\r\nwealthy Englishman, who purposed converting it into a deer-forest. How\r\nstrange a cycle! Uninhabited originally save by wild animals, it became\r\nat an early period a home of men, who, as the gray wall on the hill-side\r\ntestified, derived, in part at least, their sustenance from the chase.\r\nThey broke in from the waste the furrowed patches on the slopes of the\r\nvalleys,--they reared herds of cattle and flocks of sheep,--their number\r\nincreased to nearly five hundred souls,--they enjoyed the average\r\nhappiness of human creatures in the present imperfect state of\r\nbeing,--they contributed their portion of hardy and vigorous manhood to\r\nthe armies of the country,--and a few of their more adventurous spirits,\r\nimpatient of the narrow bounds which confined them, and a course of\r\nlife little varied by incident, emigrated to America. Then came the\r\nchange of system so general in the Highlands; and the island lost all\r\nits original inhabitants, on a wool and mutton speculation,--inhabitants,\r\nthe descendants of men who had chased the deer on its hills five hundred\r\nyears before, and who, though they recognized some wild island lord as\r\ntheir superior, and did him service, had regarded the place as indisputably\r\ntheir own. And now yet another change was on the eve of ensuing, and the\r\nisland was to return to its original state, as a home of wild animals,\r\nwhere a few hunters from the mainland might enjoy the chase for a month or\r\ntwo every twelvemonth, but which could form no permanent place of human\r\nabode. Once more, a strange and surely most melancholy cycle!\r\n\r\nThere was light enough left, as we reached the upper part of Loch\r\nScresort, to show us a shoal of small silver-coated trout, leaping by\r\nscores at the effluence of the little stream along which we had set out\r\nin the morning on our expedition. There was a net stretched across where\r\nthe play was thickest; and we learned that the haul of the previous tide\r\nhad amounted to several hundreds. On reaching the Betsey, we found a\r\npail and basket laid against the companion-head,--the basket containing\r\nabout two dozen small trout,--the minister's unsolicited teind of the\r\nmorning draught; the pail filled with razor-fish of great size. The\r\npeople of my friend are far from wealthy; there is scarce any\r\ncirculating medium in Rum; and the cottars in Eigg contrive barely\r\nenough to earn at the harvest in the Lowlands money sufficient to clear\r\nwith their landlord at rent-day. Their contributions for ecclesiastical\r\npurposes make no great figure, therefore, in the lists of the\r\nSustentation Fund. But of what they have they give willingly and in a\r\nkindly spirit; and if baskets of small trout, or pailfuls of spout-fish,\r\nwent current in the Free Church, there would, I am certain, be a per\r\ncentage of both the fish and the mollusc, derived from the Small Isles,\r\nin the half-yearly sustentation dividends. We found the supply of\r\nboth,--especially as provisions were beginning to run short in the\r\nlockers of the Betsey,--quite deserving of our gratitude. The razor-fish\r\nhad been brought us by the worthy catechist of the island. He had gone\r\nto the ebb in our special behalf, and had spent a tide in laboriously\r\nfilling the pail with these \"treasures hid in the sand;\" thoroughly\r\naware, like the old exiled puritan, who eked out his meals in a time of\r\nscarcity with the oysters of New England, that even the razor-fish,\r\nunder this head, is included in the promises. There is a peculiarity in\r\nthe razor-fish of Rum that I have not marked in the razor-fish of our\r\neastern coasts. The gills of the animal, instead of bearing the general\r\ncolor of its other parts, like those of the oyster, are of a deep green\r\ncolor, resembling, when examined by the microscope, the fringe of a\r\ngreen curtain.\r\n\r\nWe were told by John Stewart, that the expatriated inhabitants of Rum\r\nused to catch trout by a simple device of ancient standing, which\r\npreceded the introduction of nets into the island, and which, it is\r\npossible, may in other localities have not only preceded the use of the\r\nnet, but may have also suggested it: it had at least the appearance of\r\nbeing a first beginning of invention in this direction. The islanders\r\ngathered large quantities of heath, and then tying it loosely into\r\nbundles, and stripping it of its softer leafage, they laid the bundles\r\nacross the stream on a little mound held down by stones, with the tops\r\nof the heath turned upwards to the current. The water rose against the\r\nmound for a foot or eighteen inches, and then murmured over and through,\r\noccasioning an expansion among the hard elastic sprays. Next a party of\r\nthe islanders came down the stream, beating the banks and pools, and\r\nsending a still thickening shoal of trout before them, that, on\r\nreaching the miniature dam formed by the bundles, darted forward for\r\nshelter, as if to a hollow bank, and stuck among the slim hard branches,\r\nas they would in the meshes of a net. The stones were then hastily\r\nthrown off,--the bundles pitched ashore,--the better fish, to the amount\r\nnot unfrequently of several scores, secured,--and the young fry returned\r\nto the stream, to take care of themselves, and grow bigger. We fared\r\nrichly this evening, after our hard day's labor, on tea and trout; and\r\nas the minister had to attend a meeting of the Presbytery of Skye on the\r\nfollowing Wednesday, we sailed next morning for Glenelg, whence he\r\npurposed taking the steamer for Portree. Winds were light and baffling,\r\nand the currents, like capricious friends, neutralized at one time the\r\nassistance which they lent us at another. It was dark night ere we had\r\npassed Isle Ornsay, and morning broke as we cast anchor in the Bay of\r\nGlenelg. At ten o'clock the steamer heaved-to in the bay to land a few\r\npassengers, and the minister went on board, leaving me in charge of the\r\nBetsey, to follow him, when the tide set in, through the Kyles of Skye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     Kyles of Skye--A Gneiss District--Kyle Rhea--A Boiling Tide--A\r\n     \"Take\" of Sillocks--The Betsey's \"Paces\"--In the Bay at\r\n     Broadford--Rain--Island of Pabba--Description of the Island--Its\r\n     Geological Structure--Astrea--Polypifers--_Gryphaea incurva_--Three\r\n     groups of Fossils in the Lias of Skye--Abundance of the\r\n     Petrifactions of Pabba--Scenery--Pabba a \"piece of smooth, level\r\n     England\"--Fossil Shells of Pabba--Voyage resumed--Kyle Akin--Ruins\r\n     of Castle Maoil--A \"Thornback\" Dinner--The Bunch of Deep Sea\r\n     Tangle--The Caileach Stone--Kelp Furnaces--Escape of the Betsey\r\n     from sinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sailing vessel attempts threading the Kyles of Skye from the south in\r\nthe face of an adverse tide. The currents of Kyle Rhea care little for\r\nthe wind-filled sail, and battle at times, on scarce unequal terms, with\r\nthe steam-propelled paddle. The Toward Castle this morning had such a\r\nstruggle to force her way inwards, as may be seen maintained at the door\r\nof some place of public meeting during the heat of some agitating\r\ncontroversy, when seat and passage within can hold no more, and a\r\ndisappointed crowd press eagerly for admission from without. Viewed from\r\nthe anchoring place at Glenelg, the opening of the Kyle presents the\r\nappearance of the bottom of a landlocked bay;--the hills of Skye seem\r\nleaning against those of the mainland: and the tide-buffeted steamer\r\nlooked this morning as if boring her way into the earth, like a\r\ndisinterred mole, only at a rate vastly slower. First, however, with a\r\nprogress resembling that of the minute-hand of a clock, the bows\r\ndisappeared amid the heath, then the midships, then the quarter-deck and\r\nstern, and then, last of all, the red tip of the sun-brightened\r\nunion-jack that streamed gaudily behind. I had at least two hours\r\nbefore me ere the Betsey might attempt weighing anchor; and, that they\r\nmight leave some mark, I went and spent them ashore in the opening of\r\nGlenelg,--a gneiss district, nearly identical in structure with the\r\ndistrict of Knock and Isle Ornsay. The upper part of the valley is bare\r\nand treeless, but not such its character where it opens to the sea; the\r\nhills are richly wooded; and cottages, and cornfields, with here and\r\nthere a reach of the lively little river, peep out from among the trees.\r\nA group of tall roofless buildings, with a strong wall in front, form\r\nthe central point in the landscape; these are the dismantled Berera\r\nBarracks, built, like the line of forts in the great Caledonian\r\nValley,--Fort George, Fort Augustus, and Fort William,--to overawe the\r\nHighlands at a time when the loyalty of the Highlander pointed to a king\r\nbeyond the water; but all use for them has long gone by, and they now\r\nlie in dreary ruin,--mere sheltering places for the toad and the bat. I\r\nfound in a loose silt on the banks of the river, at some little distance\r\nbelow tide-mark, a bed of shells and coral, which might belong, I at\r\nfirst supposed, to some secondary formation, but which I ascertained, on\r\nexamination, to be a mere recent deposit, not so old by many centuries\r\nas our last raised sea-beaches. There occurs in various localities on\r\nthese western coasts, especially on the shores of the island of Pabba, a\r\nsprig coral, considerably larger in size than any I have elsewhere seen\r\nin Scotland; and it was from its great abundance in this bed of silt\r\nthat I was at first led to deem the deposit an ancient one.\r\n\r\nWe weighed anchor about noon, and entered the opening of Kyle Rhea.\r\nVessel after vessel, to the number of eight or ten in all, had been\r\narriving in the course of the morning, and dropping anchor, nearer the\r\nopening or farther away, each according to its sailing ability, to await\r\nthe turn of the tide; and we now found ourselves one of the components\r\nof a little fleet, with some five or six vessels sweeping up the Kyle\r\nbefore us, and some three or four driving on behind. Never, except\r\nperhaps in a Highland river big in flood, have I seen such a tide. It\r\ndanced and wheeled, and came boiling in huge masses from the bottom; and\r\nnow our bows heaved abruptly round in one direction, and now they jerked\r\nas suddenly round in another; and, though there blew a moderate breeze\r\nat the time, the helm failed to keep the sails steadily full. But\r\nwhether our sheets bellied out, or flapped right in the wind's eye, on\r\nwe swept in the tideway, like a cork caught during a thunder shower in\r\none of the rapids of the High Street. At one point the Kyle is little\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile in breadth; and here, in the powerful eddy\r\nwhich ran along the shore, we saw a group of small fishing-boats\r\npursuing a shoal of sillocks in a style that blent all the liveliness of\r\nthe chase with the specific interest of the angle. The shoal, restless\r\nas the tides among which it disported, now rose in the boilings of one\r\neddy, now beat the water into foam amid the stiller dimplings of\r\nanother. The boats hurried from spot to spot wherever the quick\r\nglittering scales appeared. For a few seconds, rods would be cast thick\r\nand fast, as if employed in beating the water, and captured fish glanced\r\nbright to the sun; and then the take would cease, and the play rise\r\nelsewhere, and oars would flash out amain, as the little fleet again\r\ndashed into the heart of the shoal. As the Kyle widened, the force of\r\nthe current diminished, and sail and helm again became things of\r\npositive importance. The wind blew a-head, steady though not strong; and\r\nthe Betsey, with companions in the voyage against which to measure\r\nherself, began to show her paces. First she passed one bulky vessel,\r\nthen another: she lay closer to the wind than any of her fellows, glided\r\nmore quickly through the water, turned in her stays like Lady Betty in\r\na minuet; and, ere we had reached Kyle Akin, the fleet in the middle of\r\nwhich we had started were toiling far behind us, all save one vessel, a\r\nstately brig; and just as we were going to pass her too, she cast\r\nanchor, to await the change of the tide, which runs from the west during\r\nflood at Kyle Akin, as it runs from the east through Kyle Rhea. The wind\r\nhad freshened; and as it was now within two hours of full sea, the force\r\nof the current had somewhat abated; and so we kept on our course,\r\ntacking in scant room, however, and making but little way. A few vessels\r\nattempted following us, but, after an inefficient tack or two, they fell\r\nback on the anchoring ground, leaving the Betsey to buffet the currents\r\nalone. Tack followed tack sharp and quick in the narrows, with an\r\niron-bound coast on either hand. We had frequent and delicate turning:\r\nnow we lost fifty yards, now we gained a hundred. John Stewart held the\r\nhelm; and as none of us had ever sailed the way before, I had the\r\nvessel's chart spread out on the companion-head before me, and told him\r\nwhen to wear and when to hold on his way,--at what places we might run\r\nup almost to the rock edge, and at what places it was safest to give the\r\nland a good offing. Hurrah for the Free Church yacht Betsey! and hurrah\r\nonce more! We cleared the Kyle, leaving a whole fleet tide-bound behind\r\nus; and, stretching out at one long tack into the open sea, bore, at the\r\nnext, right into the bay at Broadford, where we cast anchor for the\r\nnight, within two hundred yards of the shore. Provisions were running\r\nshort; and so I had to make a late dinner this evening on some of the\r\nrazor-fish of Rum, topped by a dish of tea. But there is always rather\r\nmore appetite than food in the country;--such, at least, is the common\r\nresult under the present mode of distribution: the hunger overlaps and\r\noutstretches the provision; and there was comfort in the reflection,\r\nthat with the razor-fish on which to fall back, it overlapped it but by\r\na very little on this occasion in the cabin of the Betsey. The\r\nsteam-boat passed southwards next morning, and I was joined by my friend\r\nthe minister a little before breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe day was miserably bad: the rain continued pattering on the skylight,\r\nnow lighter, now heavier, till within an hour of sunset, when it ceased,\r\nand a light breeze began to unroll the thick fogs from off the\r\nlandscape, volume after volume, like coverings from off a\r\nmummy,--leaving exposed in the valley of the Lias a brown and cheerless\r\nprospect of dark bogs and of debris-covered hills, streaked this evening\r\nwith downward lines of foam. The seaward view is more pleasing. The deep\r\nrusset of the interior we find bordered for miles along the edge of the\r\nbay with a many-shaded fringe of green; and the smooth grassy island of\r\nPabba lies in the midst, a polished gem, all the more advantageously\r\ndisplayed from the roughness of the surrounding setting. We took boat,\r\nand explored the Lias in our immediate neighborhood till dusk. I had\r\nspent several hours among its deposits when on my way to Portree, and\r\nseveral hours more when on my journey across the country to the east\r\ncoast; but it may be well, for the sake of maintaining some continuity\r\nof description, to throw together my various observations on the\r\nformation, as if made at one time, and to connect them with my\r\nexploration of Pabba, which took place on the following morning. The\r\nrocks of Pabba belong to the upper part of the Lias; while the lower\r\npart may be found leaning to the south, towards the Red Sandstones of\r\nthe Bay of Lucy. Taking what seems to be the natural order, I shall\r\nbegin with the base of the formation first.\r\n\r\nIn the general indentation of the coast, in the opening of which the\r\nisland of Pabba lies somewhat like a long green steam-boat at anchor,\r\nthere is included a smaller indentation, known as the Bay or Cove of\r\nLucy. The central space in the cove is soft and gravelly; but on both\r\nits sides it is flanked by low rocks, that stretch out into the sea in\r\nlong rectilinear lines, like the foundations of dry-stone fences. On the\r\nsouth side the rocks are red; on the north they are of a bluish-gray\r\ncolor; their hues are as distinct as those of the colored patches in a\r\nmap; and they represent geological periods that lie widely apart. The\r\nred rocks we find laid down in most of our maps as Old Red, though I am\r\ndisposed to regard them as of a much higher antiquity than even that\r\nancient system; while the bluish-gray rocks are decidedly Liasic.[3] The\r\ncove between represents a deep ditch-like hollow, which occurs in Skye,\r\nboth in the interior and on the sea-shore, in the line of boundary\r\nbetwixt the Red Sandstone and the Lias; and it \"seems to have\r\noriginated,\" says M'Culloch, \"in the decomposition of the exposed parts\r\nof the formations at their junction.\" \"Hence,\" he adds, \"from the\r\nwearing of the materials at the surface, a cavity has been produced,\r\nwhich becoming subsequently filled with rubbish, and generally covered\r\nover with a vegetable soil of unusual depth, effectually prevents a view\r\nof the contiguous parts.\" The first strata exposed on the northern side\r\nare the oldest Liasic rocks anywhere seen in Scotland. They are composed\r\nchiefly of greenish-colored fissile sandstones and calciferous grits, in\r\nwhich we meet a few fossils, very imperfectly preserved. But the\r\norganisms increase as we go on. We see in passing, near a picturesque\r\nlittle cottage,--the only one on the shores of the bay,--a crag of a\r\nsingularly rough appearance, that projects mole-like from the sward upon\r\nthe beach, and then descending abruptly to the level of the other\r\nstrata, runs out in a long ragged line into the sea. The stratum, from\r\ntwo to three feet in thickness, of which it is formed, seems wholly\r\nbuilt up of irregularly-formed rubbly concretions, just as some of the\r\ngarden-walls in the neighborhood of Edinburgh are built of the rough\r\nscoria of our glass-houses; and we find, on examination, that every\r\nseeming concretion in the bed is a perfectly formed coral of the genus\r\nAstrea. We have arrived at an entire bed of corals, all of one species.\r\nTheir surfaces, wherever they have been washed by the sea, are of great\r\nbeauty: nothing can be more irregular than the outline of each mass, and\r\nyet scarce anything more regular than the sculpturings on every part of\r\nit. We find them fretted over with polygons, like those of a honeycomb,\r\nonly somewhat less mathematically exact, and the centre of every polygon\r\ncontains its many-rayed star. It is difficult to distinguish between\r\nspecies in some of the divisions of corals: one Astrea, recent or\r\nextinct, is sometimes found so exceedingly like another of some very\r\ndifferent formation or period, that the more modern might almost be\r\ndeemed a lineal descendant of the more ancient species. With an eye to\r\nthe fact, I brought with me some characteristic specimens of this\r\nAstrea[4] of the Lower Lias, which I have ranged side by side with the\r\nAstreae of the Oolite I had found so abundant a twelvemonth before in the\r\nneighborhood of Helmsdale. In some of the hand specimens, that present\r\nmerely a piece of polygonal surface, bounded by fractured sides, the\r\ndifference is not easily distinguishable: the polygonal depressions are\r\ngenerally smaller in the Oolitic species, and shallower in the Liasic\r\none; but not unfrequently these differences disappear, and it is only\r\nwhen compared in the entire unbroken coral that their specific\r\npeculiarities acquire the necessary prominence. The Oolitic Astrea is of\r\nmuch greater size than the Liasic one: it occurs not unfrequently in\r\nmasses of from two to three feet in diameter; and as its polygons are\r\ntubes that converge to the footstalk on which it originally formed, it\r\npresents in the average outline a fungous-like appearance; whereas in\r\nthe smaller Liasic coral, which rarely exceeds a foot in diameter, there\r\nis no such general convergency of the tubes; and the form in one piece,\r\nsave that there is a certain degree of flatness common to all, bears no\r\nresemblance to the form in another. Some of the recent Astreae are of\r\ngreat beauty when inhabited by the living zoophites whose skeleton\r\nframework they compose. Every polygonal star in the mass is the house of\r\na separate animal, that, when withdrawn into its cell, presents the\r\nappearance of a minute flower, somewhat like a daisy stuck flat to the\r\nsurface, and that, when stretched out, resembles a small round tower,\r\nwith a garland of leaves bound round it atop for a cornice. The _Astrea\r\nviridis_, a coral of the tropics, presents on a ground of velvety brown\r\nmyriads of deep green florets, that ever and anon start up from the\r\nlevel in their tower-like shape, contract and expand their petals, and\r\nthen, shrinking back into their cells, straightway became florets again.\r\nThe Lower Lias presented in one of its opening scenes, in this part of\r\nthe world, appearances of similar beauty widely spread. For miles\r\ntogether,--we know not how many,--the bottom of a clear shallow sea was\r\npaved with living Astreae: every irregular rock-like coral formed a\r\nseparate colony of polypora, that, when in motion, presented the\r\nappearance of continuous masses of many-colored life, and when at rest,\r\nthe places they occupied were more thickly studded with the living\r\nflorets than the richest and most flowery piece of pasture the reader\r\never saw, with its violets or its daisies. And mile beyond mile this\r\nscene of beauty stretched on through the shallow depths of the Liasic\r\nsea. The calcareous framework of most of the recent Astreae are white;\r\nbut in the species referred to,--the _Astrea viridis_,--it is of a\r\ndark-brown color. It is not unworthy of remark, in connection with these\r\nfacts, that the Oolitic Astrea of Helmsdale occurs as a white, or, when\r\ndarkest, as a cream-colored petrifaction; whereas the Liasic Astrea of\r\nSkye is invariably of a deep earthy hue. The one was probably a white,\r\nthe other a dingy-colored coral.\r\n\r\nThe Liasic bed of Astreae existed long enough here to attain a thickness\r\nof from two to three feet. Mass rose over mass,--the living upon the\r\ndead,--till at length, by a deposit of mingled mud and sand,--the\r\neffect, mayhap, of some change of currents, induced we know not\r\nhow,--the innumerable polypedes of the living surface were buried up and\r\nkilled, and then, for many yards, layer after layer of a calciferous\r\ngrit was piled over them. The fossils of the grit are few and ill\r\npreserved; but we occasionally find in it a coral similar to the Astrea\r\nof the bed below, and, a little higher up, in an impure limestone,\r\nspecimens, in rather indifferent keeping, of a genus of polypifer which\r\nsomewhat resembles the Turbinolia of the Mountain Limestone. It presents\r\nin the cross section the same radiated structure as the _Turbinolia\r\nfungites_, and nearly the same furrowed appearance in the longitudinal\r\none; but, seen in the larger specimens, we find that it was a branched\r\ncoral, with obtuse forky boughs, in each of which, it is probable, from\r\ntheir general structure, there lived a single polype. It may have been\r\nthe resemblance which these bear, when seen in detached branches, to the\r\nolder Caryophyllia, taken in connection with the fact that the deposit\r\nin which they occur rests on the ancient Red Sandstone of the district,\r\nthat led M'Culloch to question whether this fossiliferous formation had\r\nnot nearly as clear a claim to be regarded as an analogue of the\r\nCarboniferous Limestone of England as of its Lias; and hence he\r\ncontented himself with terming it simply the Gryphite Limestone. Sir R.\r\nMurchison, whose much more close and extensive acquaintance with fossils\r\nenabled him to assign to the deposit its true place, was struck,\r\nhowever, with the general resemblance of its polypifers to \"those of the\r\nMadreporite Limestone of the Carboniferous series.\" These polypifers\r\noccur in only the lower Lias of Skye.[5] I found no corals in its higher\r\nbeds, though these are charged with other fossils, more characteristic\r\nof the formation, in vast abundance. In not a few of the middle strata,\r\ncomposed of a mud-colored fissile sandstone, the gryphites lie as\r\nthickly as currants in a Christmas cake; and as they weather white,\r\nwhile the stone in which they are embedded retains its dingy hue, they\r\nsomewhat remind one of the white-lead tears of the undertaker mottling a\r\nhatchment of sable. In a fragment of the dark sandstone, six inches by\r\nseven, which I brought with me, I reckon no fewer than twenty-two\r\ngryphites; and it forms but an average specimen of the bed from which I\r\ndetached it. By far the most abundant species is that not inelegant\r\nshell so characteristic of the formation, the _Gryphaea incurva_. We find\r\ndetached specimens scattered over the beach by hundreds, mixed up with\r\nthe remains of recent shells, as if the _Gryphaea incurva_ were a recent\r\nshell too. They lie, bleached white by the weather, among the valves of\r\ndefunct oysters and dead buccinidae; and, from their resemblance to lamps\r\ncast in the classic model, remind one, in the corners where they have\r\naccumulated most thickly, of the old magician's stock in trade, who\r\nwiled away the lamp of Aladdin from Aladdin's simple wife. The _Gryphaea\r\nobliquita_ and _Gryphaea M'Cullochii_ also occur among these middle\r\nstrata of the Lias, though much less frequently than the other. We,\r\nbesides, found in them at least two species of Pecten, with two species\r\nof Terebratula,--the one smooth, the other sulcated; a bivalve\r\nresembling a Donax; another bivalve, evidently a Gervillia, though\r\napparently of a species not yet described; and the ill-preserved rings\r\nof large Ammonites, from ten inches to a foot in diameter. Towards the\r\nbottom of the bay the fossils again become more rare, though they\r\nre-appear once more in considerable abundance as we pass along its\r\nnorthern side; but in order to acquaint ourselves with the upper\r\norganisms of the formation, we have to take boat and explore the\r\nnorthern shores of Pabba. The Lias of Skye has its three distinct groups\r\nof fossils: its lower coraline group, in which the Astrea described is\r\nmost abundant; its middle group, in which the _Gryphaea incurva_ occurs\r\nby millions; and its upper group, abounding in Ammonites, Nautili,\r\nPinnae, and Serpulae.\r\n\r\nFriday made amends for the rains and fogs of its disagreeable\r\npredecessor: the morning rose bright and beautiful, with just wind\r\nenough to fill, and barely fill, the sail, hoisted high, with miser\r\neconomy, that not a breath might be lost; and, weighing anchor, and\r\nshaking out all our canvass, we bore down on Pabba, to explore. This\r\nisland, so soft in outline and color, is formidably fenced round by\r\ndangerous reefs; and, leaving the Betsey in charge of John Stewart and\r\nhis companion, to dodge on in the offing, I set out with the minister in\r\nour little boat, and landed on the north-eastern side of the island,\r\nbeside a trap-dyke that served us as a pier. He would be a happy\r\ngeologist who, with a few thousands to spare, could call Pabba his own.\r\nIt contains less than a square mile of surface; and a walk of little\r\nmore than three miles and a half along the line where the waves break at\r\nhigh water brings the traveller back to his starting point; and yet,\r\nthough thus limited in area, the petrifactions of its shores might of\r\nthemselves fill a museum. They rise by thousands and tens of thousands\r\non the exposed planes of its sea-washed strata, standing out in bold\r\nrelief, like sculpturings on ancient tombstones, at once mummies and\r\nmonuments,--the dead and the carved memorials of the dead. Every rock is\r\na tablet of hieroglyphics, with an ascertained alphabet; every rolled\r\npebble a casket with old pictorial records locked up within. Trap-dykes,\r\nbeyond comparison finer than those of the Water of Leith, which first\r\nsuggested to Hutton his theory, stand up like fences over the\r\nsedimentary strata, or run out like moles far into the sea. The entire\r\nisland, too, so green, rich, and level, is itself a specimen\r\nillustrative of the effect of geologic formation on scenery. We find its\r\nnearest neighbor,--the steep, brown, barren island of Longa, which is\r\ncomposed of the ancient Red Sandstone of the district,--differing as\r\nthoroughly from it in aspect as a bit of granite differs from a bit of\r\nclay-slate; and the whole prospect around, save the green Liasic strip\r\nthat lies along the bottom of the Bay of Broadford, exhibits, true to\r\nits various components, Plutonic or sedimentary, a character of\r\npicturesque roughness or bold sublimity. The only piece of smooth, level\r\nEngland, contained in the entire landscape, is the fossil-mottled island\r\nof Pabba. We were first struck, on landing this morning, by the great\r\nnumber of Pinnae embedded in the strata,--shells varying from five to ten\r\ninches in length,--one species of the common flat type, exemplified in\r\nthe existing _Pinna sulcata_, and another nearly quadrangular, in the\r\ncross section, like the _Pinna lanceolata_ of the Scarborough limestone.\r\nThe quadrangular species is more deeply crisped outside than the\r\nflat one. Both species bear the longitudinal groove in the centre,\r\nand when broken across, are found to contain numerous smaller\r\nshells,--Terebratulae of both the smooth and sulcated kinds, and a\r\nspecies of minute smooth Pecten resembling the _Pecten demissus_, but\r\nsmaller. The Pinnae, ere they became embedded in the original sea-bottom,\r\nlong since hardened into rock around them, were, we find, dead shells,\r\ninto which, as into the dead open shells of our existing beaches,\r\nsmaller shells were washed by the waves. Our recent Pinnae are all\r\nsedentary shells, some of them full two feet in length, fastened to\r\ntheir places on their deep-sea floors by flowing silky byssi,--cables of\r\nmany strands,--of which beautiful pieces of dress, such as gloves and\r\nhose, have been manufactured. An old French naturalist, the Abbe Le\r\nPluche, tells us that \"the Pinna with its fleshy tongue\" (foot),--a rude\r\ninefficient looking implement for work so nice,--\"spins such threads as\r\nare more valuable than silk itself, and with which the most beautiful\r\nstuffs that ever were seen have been made by Sicilian weavers.\" Gloves\r\nmade of the byssus of recent Pinnae may be seen in the British Museum.\r\nAssociated with the numerous Pinnae of Pabba we found a delicately-formed\r\nModiola, a small Ostrya, Plagiostoma, Terebratula, several species of\r\nPectens, a triangular univalve resembling a Trochus, innumerable groups\r\nof Serpulae, and the star-like joints of Pentacrinites. The Gryphae are\r\nalso abundant, occurring in extensive beds; and Belemnites of various\r\nspecies lie as thickly scattered over the rock as if they had been the\r\nspindles of a whole kingdom thrown aside in consequence of some such\r\nedict framed to put them down as that passed by the father of the\r\nSleeping Beauty. We find, among the detached masses of the beach,\r\nspecimens of Nautilus, which, though rarely perfect, are sufficiently so\r\nto show the peculiarities of the shell; and numerous Ammonites project\r\nin relief from almost every weathered plane of the strata. These last\r\nshells, in the tract of shore which we examined, are chiefly of one\r\nspecies,--the _Ammonites spinatus_,--one of which, considerably broken,\r\nthe reader may find figured in Sowerby's \"Mineral Conchology,\" from a\r\nspecimen brought from Pabba sixteen years ago by Sir R. Murchison. It is\r\ndifficult to procure specimens tolerably complete. We find bits of outer\r\nrings existing as limestone, with every rib sharply preserved, but the\r\nrest of the fossil lost in the shale. I succeeded in finding but two\r\nspecimens that show the inner whorls. They are thickly ribbed; and the\r\nchief peculiarity which they exhibit, not so directly indicated by Mr.\r\nSowerby's figure, is, that while the ribs of the outer whorl are broad\r\nand deep, as in the _Ammonites obtusus_, they suddenly change their\r\ncharacter, and become numerous and narrow in the inner whorls, as in the\r\n_Ammonites communis_.\r\n\r\nThe tide began to flow, and we had to quit our explorations, and return\r\nto the Betsey. The little wind had become less, and all the canvas we\r\ncould hang out enabled us to draw but a sluggish furrow. The stern of\r\nthe Betsey \"wrought no buttons\" on this occasion; but she had a good\r\ntide under her keel; and ere the dinner-hour we had passed through the\r\nnarrows of Kyle Akin. The village of this name was designed by the late\r\nLord M'Donald for a great seaport town; but it refused to grow; and it\r\nhas since become a gentleman in a small way, and does nothing. It forms,\r\nhowever, a handsome group of houses, pleasantly situated on a flat green\r\ntongue of land, on the Skye side, just within the opening of the Kyle;\r\nand there rises on an eminence beyond it a fine old tower, rent open, as\r\nif by an earthquake, from top to bottom, which forms one of the most\r\npicturesque objects I have almost ever seen in a landscape. There are\r\nbold hills all around, and rocky islands, with the ceaseless rush of\r\ntides in front; while the cloven tower, rising high over the shore, is\r\nseen, in threading the Kyles, whether from the south or north, relieved\r\ndark against the sky, as the central object in the vista. We find it\r\nthus described by the Messrs. Anderson of Inverness, in their excellent\r\n\"Guide Book,\"--by far the best companion of the kind with which the\r\ntraveller who sets himself to explore our Scottish Highlands can be\r\nprovided. \"Close to the village of Kyle Akin are the ruins of an old\r\nsquare keep, called Castle Muel or Maoil, the walls of which are of a\r\nremarkable thickness. It is said to have been built by the daughter of a\r\nNorwegian king, married to a Mackinnon or Macdonald, for the purpose of\r\nlevying an impost on all vessels passing the Kyles, excepting, says the\r\ntradition, those of her own country. For the more certain exaction of\r\nthis duty, she is reported to have caused a strong chain to be stretched\r\nacross from shore to shore; and the spot in the rocks to which the\r\nterminal links were attached is still pointed out.\" It was high time for\r\nus to be home. The dinner hour came; but, in meet illustration of the\r\nprofound remark of Trotty-Veck, not the dinner. We had been in a cold\r\nModerate district, whence there came no half-dozens of eggs, or whole\r\ndozens of trout, or pailfuls of razor-fish, and in which hard\r\ncabin-biscuit cost us sixpence per pound. And now our stores were\r\nexhausted, and we had to dine as best we could, on our last half-ounce\r\nof tea, sweetened by our last quarter of a pound of sugar. I had marked,\r\nhowever, a dried thornback hanging among the rigging. It had been there\r\nnearly three weeks before, when I came first aboard, and no one seemed\r\nto know for how many weeks previous; for as it had come to be a sort of\r\nfixture in the vessel, it could be looked at without being seen. But\r\nnecessity sharpens the discerning faculty, and on this pressing\r\noccasion I was fortunate enough to see it. It was straightway taken\r\ndown, skinned, roasted, and eaten; and, though rather rich in\r\nammonia,--a substance better suited to form the food of the organisms\r\nthat do not unite sensation to vitality, than organisms so high in the\r\nscale as the minister and his friend,--we came deliberately to the\r\nopinion, that on the whole, we could scarce have dined so well on one of\r\nMajor Bellenden's jack-boots,--\"so thick in the soles,\" according to\r\nJenny Dennison, \"forby being tough in the upper leather.\" The tide\r\nfailed us opposite the opening of Loch Alsh; the wind, long dying, at\r\nlength died out into a dead calm; and we cast anchor in ten fathoms\r\nwater, to wait the ebbing current that was to carry us through Kyle\r\nRhea.\r\n\r\nThe ebb-tide set in about half an hour after sunset; and in weighing\r\nanchor to float down the Kyle,--for we still lacked wind to sail down\r\nit,--we brought up from below, on one of the anchor-flukes, an immense\r\nbunch of deep-sea tangle, with huge soft fronds and long slender stems,\r\nthat had lain flat on the rocky bottom, and had here and there thrown\r\nout roots along its length of stalk, to attach itself to the rock, in\r\nthe way the ivy attaches itself to the wall. Among the intricacies of\r\nthe true roots of the bunch, if one may speak of the true roots of an\r\nalga, I reckoned from eighteen to twenty different forms of animal\r\nlife,--Flustrae, Sertulariae, Serpulae, Anomiae, Modiolae, Astarte, Annelida,\r\nCrustacea, and Radiata. Among the Crustaceans I found a female crab of a\r\nreddish-brown color, considerably smaller than the nail of my small\r\nfinger, but fully grown apparently, for the abdominal flap was loaded\r\nwith spawn; and among the Echinoderms, a brownish-yellow sea-urchin\r\nabout the size of a pistol-bullet, furnished with comparatively large\r\nbut thinly-set spines. There is a dangerous rock in the Kyle Rhea, the\r\nCaileach stone, on which the Commissioners for the Northern Lighthouses\r\nhave stuck a bit of board about the size of a pot-lid, which, as it is\r\nknown to be there, and as no one ever sees it after sunset, is really\r\nvery effective, considering how little it must have cost the country, in\r\nwrecking vessels. I saw one of its victims, the sloop of an honest\r\nMethodist, in whose bottom the Caileach had knocked out a hole,\r\nrepairing at Isle Ornsay; and I was told, that if I wished to see more,\r\nI had only just to wait a little. The honest Methodist, after looking\r\nout in vain for the bit of board, was just stepping into the shrouds, to\r\ntry whether he could not see the rock on which the bit of board is\r\nplaced, when all at once his vessel found out both board and rock for\r\nherself. We also had anxious looking out this evening for the bit of\r\nboard: one of us thought he saw it right a-head; and when some of the\r\nothers were trying to see it too, John Stewart succeeded in discovering\r\nit half a pistol-shot astern. The evening was one of the loveliest. The\r\nmoon rose in cloudy majesty over the mountains of Glenelg, brightening\r\nas it rose, till the boiling eddies around us curled on the darker\r\nsurface in pale circlets of light, and the shadow of the Betsey lay as\r\nsharply defined on the brown patch of calm to the larboard as if it were\r\nher portrait taken in black. Immediately at the water-edge, under a tall\r\ndark hill, there were two smouldering fires, that now shot up a sudden\r\ntongue of bright flame, and now dimmed into blood-red specks, and sent\r\nthick strongly-scented trails of smoke athwart the surface of the Kyle.\r\nWe could hear, in the calm, voices from beside them, apparently those of\r\nchildren; and learned that they indicated the places of two\r\nkelp-furnaces,--things which have now become comparatively rare along\r\nthe coasts of the Hebrides. There was the low rush of tides all around,\r\nand the distant voices from the shore, but no other sounds; and, dim in\r\nthe moonshine, we could see behind us several spectral-looking sails\r\nthreading their silent way through the narrows, like twilight ghosts\r\ntraversing some haunted corridor.\r\n\r\nIt was late ere we reached the opening of Isle Ornsay; and as it was\r\nstill a dead calm we had to tug in the Betsey to the anchoring ground\r\nwith a pair of long sweeps. The minister pointed to a low-lying rock on\r\nthe left-hand side of the opening,--a favorite haunt of the seal. \"I\r\ntook farewell of the Betsey there last winter,\" he said. \"The night had\r\nworn late, and was pitch dark; we could see before us scarce the length\r\nof our bowsprit; not a single light twinkled from the shore; and, in\r\ntaking the bay, we ran bump on the skerry, and stuck fast. The water\r\ncame rushing in, and covered over the cabin-floor. I had Mrs. Swanson\r\nand my little daughter aboard with me, with one of our servant-maids who\r\nhad become attached to the family, and insisted on following us from\r\nEigg; and, of course, our first care was to get them ashore. We had to\r\nland them on the bare uninhabited island yonder, and a dreary enough\r\nplace it was at midnight, in winter, with its rocks, bogs, and heath,\r\nand with a rude sea tumbling over the skerries in front; but it had at\r\nleast the recommendation of being safe, and the sky, though black and\r\nwild, was not stormy. I had brought two lanterns ashore: the servant\r\ngirl, with the child in her lap, sat beside one of them, in the shelter\r\nof a rock; while my wife, with the other, went walking up and down along\r\na piece of level sward yonder, waving the light, to attract notice from\r\nthe opposite side of the bay. But though it was seen from the windows of\r\nmy own house by an attached relative, it was deemed merely a\r\nsingularly-distinct apparition of Will o' the Wisp, and so brought us no\r\nassistance. Meanwhile we had carried out a kedge astern of the Betsey,\r\nas the sea was flowing at the time, to keep her from beating in over the\r\nrocks; and then, taking our few movables ashore, we hung on till the\r\ntide rose, and, with our boat alongside ready for escape, succeeded in\r\nwarping her into deep water, with the intention of letting her sink\r\nsomewhere beyond the influence of the surf, which, without fail, would\r\nhave broken her up on the skerry in a few hours, had we suffered her to\r\nremain there. But though, when on the rock, the tide had risen as freely\r\nover the cabin sole inside as over the crags without, in the deep water\r\nthe Betsey gave no sign of sinking. I went down to the cabin; the water\r\nwas knee-high on the floor, dashing against bed and locker, but it rose\r\nno higher;--the enormous leak had stopped, we knew not how; and, setting\r\nourselves to the pump, we had in an hour or two a clear ship. The Betsey\r\nis clinker-built below. The elastic oak planks had yielded inwards to\r\nthe pressure of the rock, tearing out the fastenings, and admitted the\r\ntide at wide yawning seams; but no sooner was the pressure removed, than\r\nout they sprung again into their places, like bows when the strings are\r\nslackened; and when the carpenter came to overhaul, he found he had\r\nlittle else to do than to remove a split plank, and to supply a few\r\ndozens of drawn nails.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     Isle Ornsay--The Sabbath--A Sailor-minister's Sermon for\r\n     Sailors--The Scuir Sermon--Loch Carron--Groups of Moraines--A sheep\r\n     District--The Editor of the _Witness_ and the Establishment\r\n     Clergyman--Dingwall--Conon-side revisited--The Pond and its\r\n     Changes--New Faces--The Stonemason's Mark--The Burying Ground of\r\n     Urquhart--An old acquaintance--Property Qualification for Voting in\r\n     Scotland--Montgerald Sandstone Quarries--Geological Science in\r\n     Cromarty--The Danes at Cromarty--The Danish Professor and the \"Old\r\n     Red Sandstone\"--Harmonizing tendencies of Science.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anchoring ground at Isle Ornsay was crowded with coasting vessels\r\nand fishing boats; and when the Sabbath came round, no inconsiderable\r\nportion of my friend's congregation was composed of sailors and\r\nfishermen. His text was appropriate,--\"He bringeth them into their\r\ndesired haven;\" and as his sea-craft and his theology were alike\r\nexcellent, there were no incongruities in his allegory, and no defects\r\nin his mode of applying it, and the seamen were hugely delighted. John\r\nStewart, though less a master of English than of many other things, told\r\nme he was able to follow the minister from beginning to end,--a thing he\r\nhad never done before at an English preaching. The sea portion of the\r\nsermon, he said, was very plain: it was about the helm, and the sails,\r\nand the anchor, and the chart, and the pilot,--about rocks, winds,\r\ncurrents, and safe harborage; and by attending to this simpler part of\r\nit, he was led into the parts that were less simple, and so succeeded in\r\ncomprehending the whole. I would fain see this unique discourse,\r\npreached by a sailor minister to a sailor congregation, preserved in\r\nsome permanent form, with at least one other discourse,--of which I\r\nfound trace in the island of Eigg, after the lapse of more than a\r\ntwelvemonth,--that had been preached about the time of the Disruption,\r\nfull in sight of the Scuir, with its impregnable hill-fort, and in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the cave of Frances, with its heaps of dead\r\nmen's bones. One note stuck fast to the islanders. In times of peril and\r\nalarm, said the minister, the ancient inhabitants of the island had two\r\nessentially different kinds of places in which they sought security;\r\nthey had the deep, unwholesome cave, shut up from the light and the\r\nbreath of heaven, and the tall rock summit, with its impregnable fort,\r\non which the sun shone and the wind blew. Much hardship might no doubt\r\nbe encountered on the one, when the sky was black with tempest, and\r\nrains beat, or snows descended; but it was found associated with no\r\nstory of real loss or disaster,--it had kept safe all who had committed\r\nthemselves to it; whereas, in the close atmosphere of the other there\r\nwas warmth, and, after a sort, comfort; and on one memorable day of\r\ntrouble the islanders had deemed it the preferable sheltering place of\r\nthe two. And there survived mouldering skeletons and a frightful\r\ntradition, to tell the history of their choice. Places of refuge of\r\nthese very opposite kinds, said the minister, continuing his allegory,\r\nare not peculiar to your island; never was there a day or a place of\r\ntrial in which they did not advance their opposite claims: they are\r\nadvancing them even now all over the world. The one kind you find\r\ndescribed by one great prophet as low-lying \"refuges of lies,\" over\r\nwhich the desolating \"scourge must pass,\" and which the destroying\r\n\"waters must overflow;\" while the true character of the other may be\r\nlearned from another great prophet, who was never weary of celebrating\r\nhis \"rock and his fortress.\" \"Wit succeeds more from being happily\r\naddressed,\" says Goldsmith, \"than even from its native poignancy.\" If\r\nmy friend's allegory does not please quite as well in print and in\r\nEnglish as it did when delivered _viva voce_ in Gaelic, it should be\r\nremembered that it was addressed to an out-door congregation, whose\r\nminds were filled with the consequences of the Disruption,--that the\r\nbones of _Uamh Fraingh_ lay within a few hundred yards of them,--and\r\nthat the Scuir, with the sun shining bright on its summit, rose tall in\r\nthe background, scarce a mile away.\r\n\r\nOn Monday I spent several hours in reexploring the Lias of Lucy Bay and\r\nits neighborhood, and then walked on to Kyle-Akin, where I parted from\r\nmy friend Mr. Swanson, and took boat for Loch Carron. The greater part\r\nof the following day was spent in crossing the country to the east coast\r\nin the mail-gig, through long dreary glens, and a fierce storm of wind\r\nand rain. In the lower portion of the valley occupied by the river\r\nCarron, I saw at least two fine groups of moraines. One of these, about\r\na mile and a half above the parish manse, marks the place where a\r\nglacier, that had once descended from a hollow amid the northern range\r\nof hills, had furrowed up the gravel and earth before it in long ridges,\r\nwhich we find running nearly parallel to the road; the other group,\r\nwhich lies higher up the valley, and seems of considerably greater\r\nextent, indicates where one of those river-like glaciers that fill up\r\nlong hollows, and impel their irresistible flood downwards, slow as the\r\nhour-hand of a time-piece, had terminated towards the sea. I could but\r\nglance at the appearances as the gig drove past, and point them out to a\r\nfellow passenger, the Establishment minister of----, remarking, at the\r\nsame time, how much more dreary the prospect must have seemed than even\r\nit did to-day, though the fog was thick and the drizzle disagreeable,\r\nwhen the lateral hollows on each side were blocked up with ice, and\r\noverhanging glaciers, that ploughed the rock bare in their descent,\r\nglistened on the bleak hill-sides. I wore a gray maud over a coat of\r\nrough russet, with waist-coat and trowsers of plaid; and the minister,\r\nwho must have taken me, I suppose, for a southland shepherd looking out\r\nfor a farm, gave me much information of a kind I might have found\r\nvaluable had such been my condition and business, regarding the various\r\ndistricts through which we passed. On one high-lying farm, the grass, he\r\nsaid, was short and thin, but sweet and wholesome, and the flocks throve\r\nsteadily, and were never thinned by disease; whereas on another farm,\r\nthat lay along the dank bottom of a valley, the herbage was rank and\r\nrich, and the sheep fed and got heavy, but braxy at the close of autumn\r\nfell upon them like a pestilence, and more than neutralized to the\r\nfarmer every advantage of the superior fertility of the soil. It was not\r\nuninteresting, even for one not a sheep-farmer, to learn that the life\r\nof the sheep is worth fewer years' purchase in one little track of\r\ncountry than in another adjacent one; and that those differences in the\r\nsalubrity of particular spots which obtain in other parts of the world\r\nin regard to our own species, and which make it death to linger on the\r\nluxuriant river-side, while on the arid plain or elevated hill-top there\r\nis health and safety, should exist in contiguous walks in the Highlands\r\nof Scotland in reference to some of the inferior animals. The minister\r\nand I became wonderfully good friends for the time. All the seats in the\r\ngig, both back and front, had been occupied ere he had taken his\r\npassage, and the postman had assigned him a miserable place on the\r\nnarrow elevated platform in the middle, where he had to coil himself up\r\nlike a hedgehog in its hole, sadly to the discomfort of limbs still\r\nstout and strong, but stiffened by the long service of full seventy\r\nyears. And, as in the case made famous by Cowper, of the \"softer sex\"\r\nand the old-fashioned iron-cushioned arm-chairs, the old man had, as\r\nbecame his years, \"'gan murmur.\" I contrived, by sitting on the edge of\r\nthe gig on the one side, and by getting the postman to take a similar\r\nseat on the other, to find room for him in front; and there, feeling he\r\nhad not to do with savages, he became kindly and conversible. We beat\r\ntogether over a wide range of topics;--the Scotch banks, and Sir Robert\r\nPeel's intentions regarding them,--the periodical press of\r\nScotland,--the Edinburgh literati,--the Free Church even: he had been a\r\nconsistent Moderate all his days, and disliked renegades, he said; and\r\nI, of course, disliked renegades too. We both remembered that, though\r\ncivilized nations give quarter to an enemy overpowered in open fight,\r\nthey are still in the habit of shooting deserters. In short, we agreed\r\non a great many different matters; and, by comparing notes, we made the\r\nbest we could of a tedious journey and a very bad day. At the inn at\r\nGarve, a long stage from Dingwall, we alighted, and took the road\r\ntogether, to straighten our stiffened limbs, while the post man was\r\nengaged in changing horses. The minister stopped short in the middle of\r\na discussion. We are not on equal terms, he said: you know who I am, and\r\nI don't know you: we did not start fair at the beginning, but let us\r\nstart fair now. Ah, we have agreed hitherto, I replied; but I know not\r\nhow we are to agree when you know who I am: are you sure you will not be\r\nfrightened? Frightened! said the minister sturdily; no, by no man. Then,\r\nI am the Editor of the _Witness_. There was a momentary pause. \"Well,\"\r\nsaid the minister, \"it's all the same: I'm glad we should have met. Give\r\nme, man, a shake of your hand.\" And so the conversation went on as\r\nbefore till we parted at Dingwall,--the Establishment clergyman wet to\r\nthe skin, the Free Church editor in no better condition; but both,\r\nmayhap, rather less out of conceit with the ride than if it had been\r\nridden alone.\r\n\r\nI had intended passing at least two days in the neighborhood of\r\nDingwall, where I proposed renewing an acquaintance, broken off for\r\nthree-and-twenty years, with those bituminous shales of Strathpeffer in\r\nwhich the celebrated mineral waters of the valley take their rise,--the\r\nOld Red Conglomerate of Brahan, the vitrified fort of Knockferrel, the\r\nancient tower of Fairburn, above all, the pleasure-grounds of\r\nConon-side. I had spent the greater portion of my eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth years in this part of the country; and I was curious to\r\nascertain to what extent the man in middle life would verify the\r\nobservations of the lad,--to recall early incidents, revisit remembered\r\nscenes, return on old feelings, and see who were dead and who were alive\r\namong the casual acquaintances of nearly a quarter of a century ago. The\r\nmorning of Wednesday rose dark with fog and rain, but the wind had\r\nfallen; and as I could not afford to miss seeing Conon-side, I sallied\r\nout under cover of an umbrella. I crossed the bridge, and reached the\r\npleasure-grounds of Conon-house. The river was big in flood: it was\r\nexactly such a river Conon as I had lost sight of in the winter of 1821;\r\nand I had to give up all hope of wading into its fords, as I used to do\r\nearly in the autumn of that year, and pick up the pearl muscles that lie\r\nso thickly among the stones at the bottom. I saw, however, amid a\r\nthicket of bushes by the river-side, a heap of broken shells, where some\r\nherd-boy had been carrying on such a pearl fishery as I had sometimes\r\nused to carry on in my own behalf so long before; and I felt it was just\r\nsomething to see it. The flood eddied past, dark and heavy, sweeping\r\nover bulwark and bank. The low-stemmed alders that rose on islet and\r\nmound seemed shorn of half their trunks in the tide; here and there an\r\nelastic branch bent to the current, and rose and bent again; and now a\r\ntuft of withered heath came floating down, and now a soiled wreath of\r\nfoam. How vividly the past rose up before me!--boyish day-dreams\r\nforgotten for twenty years,--the fossils of an early formation of mind,\r\nproduced at a period when the atmosphere of feeling was warmer than now,\r\nand the immaturities of the mental kingdom grew rank and large, like the\r\nancient Cryptogamiae, and bore no specific resemblance to the productions\r\nof a present time. I had passed in the neighborhood the first season I\r\nanywhere spent among strangers, at an age when home is not a country,\r\nnor a province even, but simply a little spot of earth inhabited by\r\nfriends and relatives; and the rude verses, long forgotten, in which my\r\njoy had found vent when on the eve of returning to that home,--a home\r\nlittle more than twenty miles away,--came chiming as freshly into my\r\nmemory as if scarce a month had passed since I had composed them beside\r\nthe Conon.[6]\r\n\r\nThree-and-twenty years form a large portion of the short life of\r\nman,--one-third, as nearly as can be expressed in unbroken numbers, of\r\nthe entire term fixed by the psalmist, and full one-half, if we strike\r\noff the twilight periods of childhood and immature youth, and of\r\nsenectitude weary of its toils. I found curious indications among the\r\ngrounds of Conon-side, of the time that had elapsed since I had last\r\nseen them. There was a rectangular pond in a corner of a moor, near the\r\npublic road, inhabited by about a dozen voracious, frog-eating pike,\r\nthat I used frequently to visit. The water in the pond was exceedingly\r\nlimpid; and I could watch from the banks every motion of the hungry,\r\nenergetic inmates. And now I struck off from the river-side by a narrow\r\ntangled pathway, to visit it once more. I could have found out the\r\nplace blindfold: there was a piece of flat brown heath that stretched\r\nround its edges, and a mossy slope that rose at its upper side, at the\r\nfoot of which the taste of the proprietor had placed a rustic chair. The\r\nspot, though itself bare and moory, was nearly surrounded by wood, and\r\nlooked like a clearing in an American forest. There were lines of\r\ngraceful larches on two of its sides, and a grove of vigorous beeches\r\nthat directly fronted the setting sun on a third; and I had often found\r\nit a place of delightful resort, in which to saunter alone in the calm\r\nsummer evenings, after the work of the day was over. Such was the scene\r\nas it existed in my recollection. I came up to it this day through\r\ndripping trees, along a neglected pathway; and found, for the open space\r\nand the rectangular pond, a gloomy patch of water in the middle of a\r\ntangled thicket, that rose some ten or twelve feet over my head. What\r\nhad been bare heath a quarter of a century before had become a thick\r\nwood; and I remembered, that when I had been last there, the open space\r\nhad just been planted with forest-trees, and that some of the taller\r\nplants rose half-way to my knee. Human lifetimes, as now measured, are\r\nnot intended to witness both the seed-times and the harvests of\r\nforests,--both the planting of the sapling, and the felling of the huge\r\ntree into which it has grown; and so the incident impressed me strongly.\r\nIt reminded me of the sage Shalum in Addison's antediluvian tale, who\r\nbecame wealthy by the sale of his great trees, two centuries after he\r\nhad planted them. I pursued my walk, to revisit another little patch of\r\nwater which I had found so very entertaining a volume three-and-twenty\r\nyears previous, that I could still recall many of its lessons; but the\r\nhand of improvement had been busy among the fields of Conon-side; and\r\nwhen I came up to the spot which it had occupied, I found but a piece\r\nof level arable land, bearing a rank swathe of grass and clover.[7]\r\n\r\nNot a single individual did I find on the farm who had been there twenty\r\nyears before. I entered into conversation with one of the ploughmen,\r\napparently a man of some intelligence; but he had come to the place only\r\na summer or two previous, and the names of most of his predecessors\r\nsounded unfamiliar in his ears: he knew scarce anything of the old laird\r\nor his times, and but little of the general history of the district. The\r\nfrequent change of servants incident to the large-farm system has done\r\nscarce less to wear out the oral antiquities of the country than has\r\nbeen done by its busy ploughs in obliterating antiquities of a more\r\nmaterial cast. The mythologic legend and traditionary story have shared\r\nthe same fate, through the influence of the one cause, which has been\r\nexperienced by the sepulchral tumulus and the ancient encampment under\r\nthe operations of the other. I saw in the pillars and archways of the\r\nfarm-steading some of the hewn stones bearing my own mark,--an anchor,\r\nto which I used to attach a certain symbolical meaning; and I pointed\r\nthem out to the ploughman. I had hewn these stones, I said, in the days\r\nof the old laird, the grandfather of the present proprietor. The\r\nploughman wondered how a man still in middle life could have such a\r\nstory to tell. I must surely have begun work early in the day, he\r\nremarked, which was perhaps the best way for getting it soon over. I\r\nremembered having seen similar markings on the hewn-work of ancient\r\ncastles, and of indulging in, I daresay, idle enough speculations\r\nregarding what was doing at court and in the field, in Scotland and\r\nelsewhere, when the old long-departed mechanics had been engaged in\r\ntheir work. When this mark was affixed, I have said, all Scotland was\r\nin mourning for the disaster at Flodden, and the folk in the work-shed\r\nwould have been, mayhap, engaged in discussing the supposed treachery of\r\nHome, and in arguing whether the hapless James had fallen in battle, or\r\ngone on a pilgrimage to merit absolution for the death of his father.\r\nAnd when this other more modern mark was affixed, the Gowrie conspiracy\r\nmust have been the topic of the day, and the mechanics were probably\r\nspeculating,--at worst not more doubtfully than the historians have done\r\nafter them,--on the guilt or innocence of the Ruthvens. It now rose\r\ncuriously enough in memory, that I was employed in fashioning one of the\r\nstones marked by the anchor,--a corner stone in a gate-pillar,--when one\r\nof my brother apprentices entered the work-shed, laden with a bundle of\r\nnewly sharpened irons from the smithy, and said he had just been told by\r\nthe smith that the great Napoleon Bonaparte was dead. I returned to the\r\nvillage of Conon Bridge, through the woods of Conon House. The day was\r\nstill very bad: the rain pattered thick on the leaves, and fell\r\nincessantly in large drops on the pathways. There is a solitary,\r\npicturesque burying-ground on a wooded hillock beside the river, with\r\nthick dark woods all around it,--one of the two burying-grounds of the\r\nparish of Urquhart,--which I would fain have visited, but the swollen\r\nstream had risen high around, converting the hillock into an island, and\r\nforbade access. I had spent many an hour among the tombs. They are few\r\nand scattered, and of the true antique cast,--roughened with death's\r\nheads, and cross-bones, and rudely sculptured armorial bearings; and on\r\na broken wall, that marked where the ancient chapel once had stood,\r\nthere might be seen, in the year 1821, a small, badly-cut sun-dial, with\r\nits iron gnomon wasted to a saw-edged film, that contained more oxide\r\nthan metal. The only fossils described in my present chapter are fossils\r\nof mind; and the reader will, I trust, bear with me should I produce\r\none fossil more of this somewhat equivocal class. It has no merit to\r\nrecommend it,--it is simply an organism of an immature intellectual\r\nformation, in which, however, as in the Carboniferous period, there was\r\nprovision made for the necessities of an after time.[8] If a young man\r\nborn on the wrong side of the Tweed for _speaking_ English, is desirous\r\nto acquire the ability of _writing_ it, he should by all means begin by\r\ntrying to write it in verse.\r\n\r\nI passed, on my return to Dingwall, through the village of Conon Bridge;\r\nand remembering that one of the masons who had hewn beside me in the\r\nwork-shed so many years before lived in the village at the time, I went\r\ndirect to the house he had inhabited, to see whether he might not be\r\nthere still. It was a low-roofed domicile beside the river, but in the\r\ndays of my old acquaintance it had presented an appearance of great\r\ncomfort and neatness; and as there now hung an air of neglect about it,\r\nI inferred that it had found some other tenant. I inquired, however, at\r\nthe door, and was informed that Mr. ---- now lived higher up the street.\r\nI would find him, it was added, in the best house on the right-hand\r\nside,--the house with a hewn front, and a shop in it. He kept the shop,\r\nand was the owner of the house, and had another house besides, and was\r\none of the elders of the Free Church in Urquhart. Such was the standing\r\nof my old acquaintance the journeyman mason of twenty-three years ago.\r\nHe had been, when I knew him, a steady, industrious, religious\r\nman,--with but one exception the only contributor to missionary and\r\nBible societies among a numerous party of workmen; and he was now\r\noccupying a respectable place in his village, and was one of the voters\r\nof the county. Let Chartism assert what it pleases on the one hand, and\r\nToryism what it may on the other, the property-qualification of the\r\nReform Bill is essentially a good one for such a country as Scotland. In\r\nour cities it no doubt extends the political franchise to a fluctuating\r\nclass, ill hafted in society, who possess it one year and want it\r\nanother; but in our villages and smaller towns it hits very nearly the\r\nright medium for forming a premium on steady industry and character, and\r\nfor securing that at least the mass of those who possess it should be\r\nsober-minded men, with a stake in the general welfare. In running over\r\nthe histories of the various voters in one of our smaller towns, I found\r\nthat nearly one-half of the whole had, like my old comrade at Conon\r\nBridge, acquired for themselves, through steady and industrious habits,\r\nthe qualification from which they derive their vote. My companion failed\r\nto recognize in the man turned of forty the smooth-cheeked stripling of\r\neighteen, with whom he had wrought so long before. I soon succeeded,\r\nhowever, in making good my claim to his acquaintance. He had previously\r\nestablished the identity of the editor of his newspaper with his quondam\r\nfellow-workman, and a single link more was all the chain wanted. We\r\ntalked over old matters for half an hour. His wife, a staid respectable\r\nmatron, who, when I had been last in the district, was exactly such a\r\nperson as her eldest daughter, showed me an Encyclopaedia, with colored\r\nprints, which she wished to send, if she knew but how, to the Free\r\nChurch library. I walked with him through his garden, and saw trees\r\nloaded with yellow-cheeked pippins, where I had once seen only\r\nunproductive heath, that scantily covered a barren soil of ferruginous\r\nsand, and unwillingly declining an invitation to wait tea,--for a\r\nprevious engagement interfered,--I took leave of the family, and\r\nreturned to Dingwall. The following morning was gloomy, and threatened\r\nrain; and giving up my intention of exploring Strathpeffer, I took the\r\nmorning coach for Invergordon, and then walked to Cromarty, where I\r\narrived just in time for breakfast.\r\n\r\nI marked, from the top of the coach, about two miles to the north-east\r\nof Dingwall, beds of a deep gray sandstone, identical in color and\r\nappearance with some of the gray sandstones of the Middle Old Red of\r\nForfarshire, and learned that quarries had lately been opened in these\r\nbeds near Montgerald. The Old Red Sandstone lies in immense development\r\non the flanks of Ben-Wevis; and it is just possible that the analogue of\r\nthe gray flagstones of Forfar may be found among its upper beds. If so,\r\nthe quarriers should be instructed to look hard for organic\r\nremains,--the broad-headed Cephalaspis, so characteristic of the\r\nformation, and the huge Crustacean, its contemporary, that disported in\r\nplates large as those of the steel mail of the later ages of chivalry.\r\nThe geologists of Dingwall,--if Dingwall has yet got its\r\ngeologists,--might do well to attempt determining the point. I found the\r\nscience much in advance in Cromarty, especially among the ladies,--its\r\ngreat patronizers and illustrators everywhere,--and, in not a few\r\nlocalities, extensive contributors to its hoards of fact. Just as I\r\narrived, there was a pic-nic party of young people setting out for the\r\nLias of Shandwick. They spent the day among its richly fossiliferous\r\nshales and limestones, and brought back with them in the evening,\r\nAmmonites and Gryphites enough to store a museum. Cromarty had been\r\nvisited during the summer by geologists speaking a foreign tongue, but\r\nthoroughly conversant with the occult yet common language of the rocks,\r\nand deeply interested in the stories which the rocks told. The vessels\r\nin which the Crown Prince of Denmark voyaged to the Faroe Isles had\r\nbeen for some time in the bay; and the Danes, his companions, votaries\r\nof the stony science, zealously plied chisel and hammer among the Old\r\nRed Sandstones of the coast. A townsman informed me that he had seen a\r\nDanish Professor hammering like the tutelary Thor of his country among\r\nthe nodules in which I had found the first Pterichthys and first\r\nDiplacanthus ever disinterred; and that the Professor, ever and anon as\r\nhe laid open a specimen, brought it to a huge smooth boulder, on which\r\nthere lay a copy of the \"Old Red Sandstone,\" to ascertain from the\r\ndescriptions and prints its family and name. Shall I confess that the\r\ncircumstance gratified me exceedingly? There are many elements of\r\nDiscord among mankind in the present time, both at home and abroad,--so\r\nmany, that I am afraid we need entertain no hope of seeing an end, in at\r\nleast our day, to controversy and war. And we should be all the better\r\npleased, therefore, to witness the increase of those links of\r\nunion,--such as the harmonizing bonds of a scientific sympathy,--the\r\ntendency of which is to draw men together in a kindly spirit, and the\r\nformation of which involves no sacrifice of principle, moral or\r\nreligious. I do not think that the foreigner, after geologizing in my\r\ncompany, would have had any very vehement desire, in the event of a war,\r\nto cut me down, or to knock me on the head. I am afraid this chapter\r\nwould require a long apology, and for a long apology space is wanting.\r\nBut there will be no egotism, and much geology, in my next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     Ichthyolite Beds--An interesting Discovery--Two Storeys of Organic\r\n     Remains in the Old Red Sandstone--Ancient Ocean of Lower Old\r\n     Red--Two great Catastrophes--Ancient Fish Scales--Their skilful\r\n     Mechanism displayed by examples--Bone Lips--Arts of the Slater and\r\n     Tiler as old as Old Red Sandstone--Jet Trinkets--Flint\r\n     Arrow-heads--Vitrified Forts of Scotland--Style of grouping Lower\r\n     Old Red Fossils--Illustration from Cromarty Fishing\r\n     Phenomena--Singular Remains of Holoptychius--Ramble with Mr. Robert\r\n     Dick--Color of the Planet Mars--Tombs never dreamed of by\r\n     Hervey--Skeleton of the Bruce--Gigantic Holoptychius--\"Coal money\r\n     Currency\"--Upper Boundary of Lower Old Red--Every one may add to\r\n     the Store of Geological Facts--Discoveries of Messrs. Dick and\r\n     Peach.\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent one long day in exploring the ichthyolite beds on both sides the\r\nCromarty Frith, and another long day in renewing my acquaintance with\r\nthe Liasic deposit at Shandwick. In beating over the Lias, though I\r\npicked up a few good specimens, I acquired no new facts; but in\r\nre-examining the Old Red Sandstone and its organisms I was rather more\r\nsuccessful. I succeeded in eliciting some curious points not yet\r\nrecorded, which, with the details of an interesting discovery made in\r\nthe far north in this formation, I may be perhaps able to weave into a\r\nchapter somewhat more geological than my last.\r\n\r\nSome of the readers of my little work on the Old Red Sandstone will\r\nperhaps remember that I described the organisms of that ancient system\r\nas occurring in the neighborhood of Cromarty mainly on one platform,\r\nraised rather more than a hundred feet over the great Conglomerate; and\r\nthat on this platform, as if suddenly overtaken by some wide-spread\r\ncatastrophe, the ichthyolites lie by thousands and tens of thousands,\r\nin every attitude of distortion and terror. We see the spiked wings of\r\nthe Pterichthys elevated to the full, as they had been erected in the\r\nfatal moment of anger and alarm, and the bodies of the Cheirolepis and\r\nCheiracanthus bent head to tail, in the stiff posture into which they\r\nhad curled when the last pang was over. In various places in the\r\nneighborhood the ichthyolites are found _in situ_ in their coffin-like\r\nnodules, where it is impossible to trace the relation of the beds in\r\nwhich they occur to the rocks above and below; and I had suspected for\r\nyears that in at least some of the localities, they could not have\r\nbelonged to the lower platform of death, but to some posterior\r\ncatastrophe that had strewed with carcasses some upper platform. I had\r\nthought over the matter many a time and oft when I should have been\r\nasleep,--for it is marvellous how questions of the kind grow upon a man;\r\nand now, selecting as a hopeful scene of inquiry the splendid section\r\nunder the Northern Sutor, I set myself doggedly to determine whether the\r\nOld Red Sandstone in this part of the country has not at least its two\r\nstoreys of organic remains, each of which had been equally a scene of\r\nsudden mortality. I was entirely successful. The lower ichthyolite bed\r\noccurs exactly one hundred and fourteen feet over the great\r\nConglomerate; and three hundred and eighteen feet higher up I found a\r\nsecond ichthyolite bed, as rich in fossils as the first, with its thorny\r\nAcanthodians twisted half round, as if still in the agony of\r\ndissolution, and its Pterichthyes still extending their spear-like arms\r\nin the attitude of defence. The discovery enabled me to assign to their\r\ntrue places the various ichthyolite beds of the district. Those in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the town, and a bed which abuts on the Lias at\r\nEathie, belong to the upper platform; while those which appear in Eathie\r\nBurn, and along the shores at Navity, belong to the lower. The chief\r\ninterest of the discovery, however, arises from the light which it\r\nthrows on the condition of the ancient ocean of the Lower Old Red, and\r\non the extreme precariousness of the tenure on which the existence of\r\nits numerous denizens was held. In a section of little more than a\r\nhundred yards there occur at least two platforms of violent\r\ndeath,--platforms inscribed with unequivocal evidence of two great\r\ncatastrophes which over wide areas depopulated the seas. In the Old Red\r\nSandstone of Caithness there are many such platforms: storey rises over\r\nstorey; and the floor of each bears its closely-written record of\r\ndisaster and sudden extinction. Pompeii in this northern locality lies\r\nover Herculaneum, and Anglano over both. We cease to wonder why the\r\nhigher order of animals should not have been introduced into a scene of\r\nbeing that had so recently arisen out of chaos, and over which the reign\r\nof death so frequently returned. In a somewhat different sense from that\r\nindicated by the poet of the \"Seasons,\"\r\n\r\n \"As yet the trembling _year_ was unconfirmed,\r\n And _winter_ oft at eve resumed the gale.\"\r\n\r\nLying detached in the stratified clay of the fish-beds, there occur in\r\nabundance single plates and scales of ichthyolites, which, as they can\r\nbe removed entire, and viewed on both sides, illustrate points in the\r\nmechanism of the creatures to which they belonged that cannot be so\r\nclearly traced in the same remains when locked up in stone. There is a\r\nvast deal of skilful carpentry exhibited--if carpentry I may term it--in\r\nthe coverings of these ancient ichthyolites. In the commoner fish of our\r\nexisting seas the scales are so thin and flexible,--mere films of\r\nhorn,--that there is no particularly nice fitting required in their\r\narrangement. The condition, too, through which portions of unprotected\r\nskin may be presented to the water, as over and between the rays of the\r\nfins, and on the snout and lips, obviates many a mechanical difficulty\r\nof the earlier period, when it was a condition, as the remains\r\ndemonstrate, that no bit of naked skin, should be exposed, and when the\r\nscales and plates were formed, not of thin horny films, but of solid\r\npieces of bone. Thin slates lie on the roof of a modern dwelling,\r\nwithout any nice fitting;--they are scales of the modern construction:\r\nbut it required much nice fitting to make thick flagstones lie on the\r\nroof of an ancient cathedral;--_they_, on the other hand, were scales of\r\nthe ancient type. Again, it requires no ingenuity whatever, to suffer\r\nthe hands and face to go naked,--and such is the condition of our\r\nexisting fish, with their soft skinny snouts and membranous fins; but to\r\ncover the hands with flexible steel gauntlets, and the face with such an\r\niron mask as that worn by the mysterious prisoner of Louis XIV., would\r\nrequire a very large amount of ingenuity indeed; and the ancient\r\nichthyolites of the Old Red were all masked and gauntleted. Now the\r\ndetached plates and scales of the stratified clay exhibit not a few of\r\nthe mechanical contrivances through which the bony coverings of these\r\nfish were made to unite--as in coats of old armor--great strength with\r\ngreat flexibility. The scales of the Osteolepis and Diplopterus I found\r\nnicely bevelled atop and at one of the sides; so that where they\r\noverlapped each other,--for at the joints not a needle-point could be\r\ninsinuated,--the thickness of the two scales equalled but the thickness\r\nof one scale in the centre, and thus an equable covering was formed. I\r\nbrought with me some of these detached scales, and they now lie fitted\r\ntogether on the table before me, like pieces of complicated hewn work\r\ncarefully arranged on the ground ere the workman transfers them to their\r\nplace on the wall. In the smaller-scaled fish, such as the\r\nCheiracanthus and Cheirolepis, a different principle obtained. The\r\nminute glittering rhombs of bone were set thick on the skin, like those\r\nsmall scales of metal sewed on leather, that formed an inferior kind of\r\narmor still in use in eastern nations, and which was partially used in\r\nour own country just ere the buff coat altogether superseded the coat of\r\nmail. I found a beautiful piece of jaw in the clay, with the enamelled\r\ntusks bristling on its brightly enamelled edge, like iron teeth in an\r\niron rake. Mr. Parkinson expresses some wonder, in his work on fossils,\r\nthat in a fine ichthyolite in the British Museum, not only the teeth\r\nshould have been preserved, but also the lips; but we now know enough of\r\nthe construction of the more ancient fish, to cease wondering. The lips\r\nwere formed of as solid bone as the teeth themselves, and had as fair a\r\nchance of being preserved entire; just as the metallic rim of a toothed\r\nwheel has as fair a chance of being preserved as the metallic teeth that\r\nproject from it. I was interested in marking the various modes of\r\nattachment to the body of the animal which the detached scales exhibit.\r\nThe slater fastens on his slates with nails driven into the wood: the\r\ntiler secures his tiles by means of a raised bar on the under side of\r\neach, that locks into a corresponding bar of deal in the framework of\r\nthe roof. Now in some of the scales I found the art of the tiler\r\nanticipated; there were bars raised on their inner sides, to lay hold of\r\nthe skin beneath; while in others it was the art of the slater that had\r\nbeen anticipated,--the scales had been slates fastened down by long\r\nnails driven in slantwise, which were, however, mere prolongations of\r\nthe scale itself. Great truths may be repeated until they become\r\ntruisms, and we fail to note what they in reality convey. The great\r\ntruth that all knowledge dwelt without beginning in the adorable Creator\r\nmust, I am afraid, have been thus common-placed in my mind; for at\r\nfirst it struck me as wonderful that the humble arts of the tiler and\r\nslater should have existed in perfection in the times of the Old Red\r\nSandstone.\r\n\r\nI had often remarked amid the fossiliferous limestones of the Lower Old\r\nRed, minute specks and slender veins of a glossy bituminous substance\r\nsomewhat resembling jet, sufficiently hard to admit of a tolerable\r\npolish, and which emitted in the fire a bright flame, I had remarked,\r\nfurther, its apparent identity with a substance used by the ancient\r\ninhabitants of the northern part of the country in the manufacture of\r\ntheir rude ornaments, as occasionally found in sepulchral urns, such as\r\nbeads of an elliptical form, and flat parallelograms, perforated\r\nedge-wise by some four or five holes a-piece; but I had failed hitherto\r\nin detecting in the stone, portions of sufficient bulk for the formation\r\nof either the beads or the parallelograms. On this visit to the\r\nichthyolite beds, however, I picked up a nodule that inclosed a mass of\r\nthe jet large enough to admit of being fashioned into trinkets of as\r\ngreat bulk as any of the ancient ones I have yet seen, and a portion of\r\nwhich I succeeded in actually forming into a parallelogram, that could\r\nnot have been distinguished from those of our old sepulchral urns. It is\r\ninteresting enough to think, that these fossiliferous beds, altogether\r\nunknown to the people of the country for many centuries, and which, when\r\nI first discovered them, some twelve or fourteen years ago, were equally\r\nunknown to geologists, should have been resorted to for this substance,\r\nperhaps thousands of years ago, by the savage aborigines of the\r\ndistrict. But our antiquities of the remoter class furnish us with\r\nseveral such facts. It is comparatively of late years that we have\r\nbecome acquainted with the yellow chalk-flints of Banffshire and\r\nAberdeen; though before the introduction of iron into the country they\r\nseem to have been well known all over the north of Scotland. I have\r\nnever yet seen a stone arrow-head found in any of the northern\r\nlocalities, that had not been fashioned out of this hard and splintery\r\nsubstance,--a sufficient proof that our ancestors, ere they had formed\r\ntheir first acquaintance with the metals, were intimately acquainted\r\nwith at least the mechanical properties of the chalk-flint, and knew\r\nwhere in Scotland it was to be found. They were mineralogists enough,\r\ntoo, as their stone battle-axes testify, to know that the best\r\ntool-making rock is the axe-stone of Werner; and in some localities they\r\nmust have brought their supply of this rather rare mineral from great\r\ndistances. A history of those arts of savage life, as shown in the\r\nrelics of our earlier antiquities, which the course of discovery sereved\r\nthoroughly to supplant, but which could not have been carried on without\r\na knowledge of substances and qualities afterwards lost, until\r\nre-discovered by scientific curiosity, would form of itself an\r\nexceedingly curious chapter. The art of the gun-flint maker (and it,\r\ntoo, promises soon to pass into extinction) is unquestionably a curious\r\none, but not a whit more curious or more ingenious than the art\r\npossessed by the rude inhabitants of our country eighteen hundred years\r\nago, of chipping arrow-heads with an astonishing degree of neatness out\r\nof the same stubborn material. They found, however, that though flint\r\nmade a serviceable arrow-head, it was by much too brittle for an adze or\r\nbattle-axe; and sought elsewhere than among the Banffshire gravels for\r\nthe rock out of which these were to be wrought. Where they found it in\r\nour northern provinces I have not yet ascertained. It is but a short\r\ntime since I came to know that they were beforehand with me in the\r\ndiscovery of the bituminous jet of the Lower Old Red Sandstone, and were\r\nexcavators among its fossiliferous beds. The vitrified forts of the\r\nnorth of Scotland give evidence of yet another of the obsolete arts.\r\nBefore the savage inhabitants of the country were ingenious enough to\r\nknow the uses of mortar, or were furnished with tools sufficiently hard\r\nand solid to dress a bit of sandstone, they must have been acquainted\r\nwith the _chemical_ fact, that with the assistance of fluxes, a pile of\r\nstones could be fused into a solid wall, and with the _mineralogical_\r\nfact, that there are certain kinds of stones which yield much more\r\nreadily to the heat than others. The art of making vitrified forts was\r\nthe art of making ramparts of rock through a knowledge of the less\r\nobstinate earths and the more powerful fluxes. I have been informed by\r\nMr. Patrick Duff of Elgin, that he found, in breaking open a vitrified\r\nfragment detached from an ancient hill-fort, distinct impressions of the\r\nserrated kelp-weed of our shores,--the identical flux which, in its\r\ncharacter as the kelp of commerce, was so extensively used in our\r\nglass-houses only a few years ago.\r\n\r\nI was struck, during my explorations at this time, as I had been often\r\nbefore, by the style of grouping, if I may so speak, which obtains among\r\nthe Lower Old Red fossils. In no deposit with which I am acquainted,\r\nhowever rich in remains, have all its ichthyolites been found lying\r\ntogether. The collector finds some one or two species very numerous;\r\nsome two or three considerably less so, but not unfrequent; some one or\r\ntwo more, perhaps, exceedingly rare; and a few, though abundant in other\r\nlocalities, that never occur at all. In the Cromarty beds, for instance,\r\nI never found a Holoptychius, and a Dipterus only once; the Diplopterus\r\nis rare; the Glyptolepis not common; the Cheirolepis and Pterichthys\r\nmore so, but not very abundant; the Cheiracanthus and Diplacanthus, on\r\nthe other hand, are numerous; and the Osteolepis and Coccosteus more\r\nnumerous still. But in other deposits of the same formation, though a\r\nsimilar style of grouping obtains, the proportions are reversed with\r\nregard to species and genera: the fish rare in one locality abound in\r\nanother. In Banniskirk, for instance, the Dipterus is exceedingly\r\ncommon, while the Osteolepis and Coccosteus are rare, and the\r\nCheiracanthus and Cheirolepis seem altogether awanting. Again, in the\r\nMorayshire deposits, the Glyptolepis is abundant, and noble specimens of\r\nthe Lower Old Red Holoptychius--of which more anon--are to be found in\r\nthe neighborhood of Thurso, associated with remains of the Diplopterus,\r\nCoccosteus, Dipterus, and Osteolepis. The fact may be deemed of some\r\nlittle interest by the geologist, and may serve to inculcate caution, by\r\nshowing that it is not always safe to determine regarding the place or\r\nage of subordinate formations from the per centage of certain fossils\r\nwhich they may be found to contain, or from the fact that they should\r\nwant some certain organisms of the system to which they belong, and\r\npossess others. These differences may and do exist in contemporary\r\ndeposits; and I had a striking example, on this occasion, of their\r\ndependence on a simple law of instinct, which is as active in producing\r\nthe same kind of phenomena now as it seems to have been in the earlier\r\ndays of the Old Red Sandstone. The Cromarty and Moray Friths, mottled\r\nwith fishing boats (for the bustle of the herring fishers had just\r\nbegun), stretched out before me. A few hundred yards from the shore\r\nthere was a yawl lying at anchor, with an old fisherman and a few boys\r\nangling from the stern for sillocks (the young of the coal-fish) and for\r\nsmall rock-cod. A few miles higher up, where the Cromarty Frith expands\r\ninto a wide landlocked basin, with shallow sandy shores, there was a\r\nsecond yawl engaged in fishing for flounders and small skate,--for such\r\nare the kinds of fish that frequent the flat shallows of the basin. A\r\nturbot-net lay drying in the sun: it served to remind me that some six\r\nor eight miles away, in an opposite direction, there is a deep-sea bank,\r\non which turbot, halibut, and large skate are found. Numerous boats were\r\nstretching down the Moray Frith, bound for the banks of a more distant\r\nlocality, frequented at this early stage of the herring fishing by\r\nshoals of herrings, with their attendant dog-fish and cod; and I knew\r\nthat in yet another deep-sea range there lie haddock and whiting banks.\r\nAlmost every variety of existing fish in the two friths has its own\r\npeculiar habitat; and were they to be destroyed by some sudden\r\ncatastrophe, and preserved by some geologic process, on the banks and\r\nshoals which they frequent, there would occur exactly the same phenomena\r\nof grouping in the fossiliferous contemporaneous deposits which they\r\nwould thus constitute, as we find exhibited by the deposits of the Lower\r\nOld Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Holoptychius occur, I have said, in the neighborhood of\r\nThurso. I must now add, that very singular remains they are,--full of\r\ninterest to the naturalist, and, in great part at least, new to Geology.\r\nMy readers, votaries of the stony science, must be acquainted with the\r\nmasterly paper of Mr. Sedgwick and Sir R. Murchison \"On the Old Red\r\nSandstone of Caithness and the North of Scotland generally,\" which forms\r\npart of the second volume (second series) of the \"Transactions of the\r\nGeological Society,\" and with the description which it furnishes, among\r\nmany others, of the rocks in the neighborhood of Thurso.\r\nCalcareo-bituminous flags, grits, and shales, of which the paving\r\nflagstones of Caithness may be regarded as the general type, occur on\r\nthe shores, in reefs, crags, and precipices; here stretching along the\r\ncoast in the form of flat, uneven bulwarks: there rising over it in\r\nsteep walls; yonder leaning to the surf, stratum against stratum, like\r\nflights of stairs thrown down from their slant position to the level; in\r\nsome places severed by faults; in others cast about in every possible\r\ndirection, as if broken and contorted by a thousand antagonist\r\nmovements; but in their general bearing rising towards the east, until\r\nthe whole calcareo-bituminous schists of which this important member of\r\nthe system is composed disappear under the red sandstones of Dunnet\r\nHead. Such, in effect, is the general description of Mr. Sedgwick and\r\nSir R. Murchison, of the rocks in the neighborhood of Thurso. It\r\nindicates further, that in at least three localities in the range there\r\noccur in the grits and shales, scales and impressions of fish. And such\r\nwas the ascertained geology of the deposit when taken up last year by an\r\ningenious tradesman of Thurso, Mr. Robert Dick, whose patient\r\nexplorations, concentrated mainly on the fossil remains of this deposit,\r\nbid fair to add to our knowledge of the ichthyology of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. Let us accompany Mr. Dick in one of his exploratory rambles.\r\nThe various organisms which he disinterred I shall describe from\r\nspecimens before me, which I owe to his kindness,--the localities in\r\nwhich he found them, from a minute and interesting description, for\r\nwhich I am indebted to his pen.\r\n\r\nLeaving behind us the town at the bottom of its deep bay, we set out to\r\nexplore a bluff-headed parallelogramical promontory, bounded by Thurso\r\nBay on the one hand, and Murkle Bay on the other, and which presents to\r\nthe open sea, in the space that stretches between, an undulating line of\r\niron-bound coast, exposed to the roll of the northern ocean. We pass two\r\nstations in which the hard Caithness flagstones so well known in\r\ncommerce are jointed by saws wrought by machinery. As is common in the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, in which scarce any stratum solid enough to be of\r\nvalue to the workmen, whether for building or paving, contains good\r\nspecimens, we find but little to detain us in the dark coherent beds\r\nfrom which the flags are quarried. Here and there a few glittering\r\nscales occur; here and there a few coprolitic patches; here and there\r\nthe faint impression of a fucoid; but no organism sufficiently entire to\r\nbe transferred to the bag. As we proceed outwards, however, and the\r\nfitful breeze comes laden with the keen freshness of the open sea, we\r\nfind among the hard dark strata in the immediate neighborhood of Thurso\r\nCastle, a paler-colored bed of fine-grained semi-calcareous stone,\r\ncharged with remains in a state of coherency and keeping better fitted\r\nto repay the labor of the specimen-collector. The inclosing matrix is\r\ncomparatively soft: when employed in the neighboring fences as a\r\nbuilding stone, we see it resolved by the skyey influences into\r\nwell-nigh its original mud; whereas the organisms which it contains are\r\ncomposed of a hard, scarce destructible substance,--bone steeped in\r\nbitumen; and the enamel on their outer surfaces is still as glossy and\r\nbright as the japan on a _papier-mache_ tray fresh from the hands of the\r\nworkman. Their deep black, too, contrasts strongly with the pale hue of\r\nthe stone. They consist chiefly of scales, spines, dermal plates,\r\nsnouts, skull-caps, and vegetable impressions. A little farther on, in a\r\nthick bed interposed between two faults, the same kind of remains occur\r\nin the same abundance, largely mingled with scales and teeth of\r\nHoloptychius, tuberculated plates, and coprolitic blotches; and further\r\non still, in a rubbly flagstone, near where a little stream comes\r\ntrotting merrily from the uplands to the sea, there occur\r\nskull-plates,--at least one of which has been disinterred entire,--large\r\nand massy as the helmets of ancient warriors. We have now reached the\r\nouter point of the promontory, where the seaward wave, as it comes\r\nrolling unbroken from the Pole, crosses, in nearing the shore, the\r\neastward sweep of the great Gulf-stream, and then casts itself headlong\r\non the rocks. The view has been extending with almost every step we have\r\ntaken, and it has now expanded into a wide and noble prospect of ocean\r\nand bay, island and main, bold surf-skirted headlands, and green\r\nretiring hollows. Yonder, on the one hand, are the Orkneys, rising dim\r\nand blue over the foam-mottled currents of the Pentland Frith; and\r\nyonder, on the other, the far-stretching promontory of Holborn Head,\r\nwith the line of coast that sweeps along the opposite side of the bay;\r\nhere sinking in abrupt flagstone precipices direct into the tide; there\r\nreceding in grassy banks formed of a dark blue diluvium. The fields and\r\ndwellings of living men mingle in the landscape with old episcopal ruins\r\nand ancient burying-grounds; and yonder, well-nigh in the opening of the\r\nFrith, gleams ruddy to the sun,--a true blood-colored blush, when all\r\naround is azure or pale,--the tall Red Sandstone precipices of Dunnet\r\nHead. It has been suggested that the planet Mars may owe its red color\r\nto the extensive development of some such formation as the Old Red\r\nSandstone of our own planet: the existing formation in Mars may, at the\r\npresent time, it is said, be a Red Sandstone formation. It seems much\r\nmore probable, however, that the red flush which characterizes the whole\r\nof that planet,--its oceans as certainly as its continents,--should be\r\nrather owing to some widely-diffused peculiarity of the surrounding\r\natmosphere, than to aught peculiar in the varied surface of land and\r\nwater which that atmosphere surrounds; but certainly the extensive\r\nexistence of such a red system might produce the effect. If the rocks\r\nand soils of Dunnet Head formed average specimens of those of our globe\r\ngenerally, we could look across the heavens at Mars with a disk vastly\r\nmore rubicund and fiery than his own. The earth, as seen from the moon,\r\nwould seem such a planet bathed in blood as the moon at its rising\r\nfrequently appears from the earth.\r\n\r\nWe have rounded the promontory. The beds exposed along the coast to the\r\nlashings of the surf are of various texture and character,--here tough,\r\nbituminous, and dark; there of a pale hue, and so hard that they ring to\r\nthe hammer like plates of cast iron; yonder soft, unctuous, and\r\ngreen,--a kind of chloritic sandstone. And these very various powers of\r\nresistance and degrees of hardness we find indicated by the rough\r\nirregularities of the surface. The softer parts retire in long\r\ntrench-like hollows,--the harder stand out in sharp irregular ridges.\r\nFossils abound: the bituminous beds glitter bright with glossy\r\nquadrangular scales, that look like sheets of black mica inclosed in\r\ngranite. We find jaws, teeth, tubercled plates, skull-caps, spines, and\r\nfucoids,--\"tombs among which to contemplate,\" says Mr. Dick, \"of which\r\nHervey never dreamed.\" The condition of complete keeping in which we\r\ndiscover some of these remains, even when exposed to the incessant dash\r\nof the surf, seems truly wonderful. We see scales of Holoptychius\r\nstanding up in bold relief from the hard cherty rock that has worn from\r\naround them, with all the tubercles and wavy ridges of their sculpture\r\nentire. This state of keeping seems to be wholly owing to the curious\r\nchemical change that has taken place in their substance. Ere the\r\nskeleton of the Bruce, disinterred entire after the lapse of five\r\ncenturies, was recommitted to the tomb, there were such measures taken\r\nto secure its preservation, that were it to be again disinterred even\r\nafter as many centuries more had passed, it might be found retaining\r\nunbroken its gigantic proportions. There was molten pitch poured over\r\nthe bones in a state of sufficient fluidity to permeate all their\r\npores, and fill up the central hollows, and which, soon hardening around\r\nthem, formed a bituminous matrix, in which they may lie unchanged for\r\nmore than a thousand years. Now, exactly such was the process of keeping\r\nto which nature resorted with these skeletons of the Old Red Sandstone.\r\nThe animal matter with which they were charged had been converted into a\r\nhard black bitumen. Like the bones of the Bruce, they are bones steeped\r\nin pitch; and so thoroughly is every pore and hollow still occupied,\r\nthat, when cast into the fire, they flamed like torches. In one of the\r\nbeds at which we have now arrived Mr. Dick found the occipital plates of\r\na Holoptychius of gigantic proportions. The frontal plates measured full\r\nsixteen inches across, and from the nape of the neck to a little above\r\nthe place of the eyes, full eighteen; while a single plate belonging to\r\nthe lower part of the head measures thirteen and a half inches by seven\r\nand a half. I have remarked, in my little work on the Old Red\r\nSandstone,--founding on a large amount of negative evidence, that a\r\nmediocrity of size and bulk seems to have obtained among the fish of the\r\nLower Old Red, though in at least the Upper formation, a considerable\r\nincrease in both took place. A single piece of positive evidence,\r\nhowever, outweighs whole volumes of a merely negative kind. From the\r\nentire plate now in my possession, which is identical with one figured\r\nin Mr. Noble of St. Madoes' specimen, and from the huge fragments of the\r\nupper plates now before me, some of which are full five-eighth parts of\r\nan inch in thickness, I am prepared to demonstrate that this\r\nHoloptychius of the Lower Old Red must have been at least thrice the\r\nsize of the _Holoptychius Nobilissimus_ of Clashbennie.\r\n\r\nStill we pass on, though with no difficulty, over the rough contorted\r\ncrags, worn by the surf into deep ruts and uneven ridges, gnarled\r\nprotuberances, and crater-like hollows. The fossiliferous beds are\r\nstill very numerous, and largely charged with remains. We see dermal\r\nbones, spines, scales, and jaws, projecting in high relief from the\r\nsea-worn surface of the ledges below, and from the weatherworn faces of\r\nthe precipices above; for an uneven wall of crags some thirty or forty\r\nfeet high, now runs along the shore. We have reached what seems a large\r\nmole, that sloping downwards athwart the beach from the precipices, like\r\na huge boat-pier, runs far into the surf. We find it composed of a\r\nsiliceous bed, so intensely compact and hard, that it has preserved its\r\nproportions entire, while every other rock has worn from around it. For\r\ncentury after century have the storms of the fierce north-west sent\r\ntheir long ocean-nursed waves to dash against it in foam; for century\r\nafter century have the never-ceasing currents of the Pentland chafed\r\nagainst its steep sides, or eddied over its rough crest; and yet still\r\ndoes it remain unwasted and unworn,--its abrupt wall retaining all its\r\nformer steepness, and every angular jutting all the original sharpness\r\nof edge. As we advance the scenery becomes wilder and more broken: here\r\nan irregular wall of rock projects from the crags towards the sea; there\r\na dock-like hollow, in which the water gleams green, intrudes from the\r\nsea upon the crags; we pass a deep lime-encrusted cave, with which\r\ntradition associates some wild legends, and which, from the supposed\r\nresemblance of the hanging stalactites to the entrails of a large animal\r\nwounded in the chase, bears the name of Pudding-Gno; and then, turning\r\nan angle of the coast, we enter a solitary bay, that presents at its\r\nupper extremity a flat expanse of sand. Our walk is still over\r\nsepulchres charged with the remains of the long-departed. Scales of\r\nHoloptychius abound, scattered like coin over the surface of the ledges.\r\nIt would seem--to borrow from Mr. Dick--as if some old lord of the\r\ntreasury, who flourished in the days of the coal-money currency, had\r\ntaken a squandering fit at Sanday Bay, and tossed the dingy contents of\r\nhis treasure-chest by shovelfuls upon the rocks. Mr. Dick found in this\r\nlocality some of his finest specimens, one of which--the inner side of\r\nthe skull-cap of a Holoptychius, with every plate occupying its proper\r\nplace, and the large angular holes through which the eyes looked out\r\nstill entire--I trust to be able by and by to present to the public in a\r\ngood engraving. There occur jaws, plates, scales spines,--the remains of\r\nfucoids, too, of great size and in vast abundance. Mr. Dick has\r\ndisinterred from among the rocks of Sanday Bay flattened carbonaceous\r\nstems four inches in diameter. We are still within an hour's walk of\r\nThurso; but in that brief hour how many marvels have we witnessed!--how\r\nvast an amount of the vital mechanisms of a perished creation have we\r\nnot passed over! Our walk has been along ranges of sepulchres, greatly\r\nmore wonderful than those of Thebes or Petraea, and mayhap a thousand\r\ntimes more ancient. There is no lack of life along the shores of the\r\nsolitary little bay. The shriek of the sparrow-hawk mingles from the\r\ncliffs with the hoarse deep croak of the raven; the cormorant on some\r\nwave-encircled ledge, hangs out his dark wing to the breeze; the spotted\r\ndiver, plying his vocation on the shallows beyond, dives and then\r\nappears, and dives and appears again, and we see the silver glitter of\r\nscales from his beak; and far away in the offing the sunlight falls on a\r\nscull of seagulls, that flutter upwards, downwards, and athwart, now in\r\nthe air, thick as midges over some forest-brook in an evening of\r\nmidsummer.\r\n\r\nBut we again pass onwards, amid a wild ruinous scene of abrupt faults,\r\ndetached fragments of rocks, and reversed strata: again the ledges\r\nassume their ordinary position and aspect, and we rise from lower to\r\nhigher and still higher beds in the formation,--for such, as I have\r\nalready remarked, is the general arrangement from west to east, along\r\nthe northern coast of Caithness, of the Old Red Sandstone. The great\r\nConglomerate base of the formation we find largely developed at Port\r\nSkerry, just where the western boundary line of the county divides it\r\nfrom the county of Sutherland; its thick upper coping of sandstone we\r\nsee forming the tall cliffs of Dunnet Head; and the greater part of the\r\nspace between, nearly twenty miles as the crow flies, is occupied\r\nchiefly by the shales, grits, and flagstones, which we have found\r\ncharged so abundantly with the strangely-organized ichthyolites of the\r\nsecond stage of vertebrate existence. In the twenty intervening miles\r\nthere are many breaks and faults, and so there may be, of course,\r\nrecurrences of the same strata, and re-appearances of the same beds;\r\nbut, after making large allowance for partial foldings and repetitions,\r\nwe must regard the development of this formation, with which the twenty\r\nmiles are occupied, as truly enormous. And yet it is but one of three\r\nthat occur in a single system. We reach the long flat bay of Dunnet, and\r\ncross its waste of sands. The incoherent coils of the sand-worm lie\r\nthick on the surface; and here a swarm of buzzing flies, disturbed by\r\nthe foot, rises in a cloud from some tuft of tangled sea-weed; and here\r\nmyriads of gray crustaceous sand-hoppers dart sidelong in the little\r\npools, or vault from the drier ridges a few inches into the air. Were\r\nthe trilobites of the Silurian system,--at one period, as their remains\r\ntestify, more than equally abundant,--creatures of similar habits? We\r\nhave at length arrived at the tall sandstone precipices of Dunnet, with\r\ntheir broad decaying fronts of red and yellow; but in vain may we ply\r\nhammer and chisel among them: not a scale, not a plate, not even the\r\nstain of an imperfect fucoid appears. We have reached the upper boundary\r\nof the Lower Old Red formation, and find it bordered by a desert devoid\r\nof all trace of life. Some of the characteristic types of the formation\r\nre-appear in the upper deposits; but though there is a reproduction of\r\nthe original works in their more characteristic passages, if I may so\r\nspeak, many of the readings are diverse, and the editions are all new.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the circumstances of peculiar interest with which Geology\r\nat its present stage is invested, that there is no man of energy and\r\nobservation who may not rationally indulge in the hope of extending its\r\nlimits by adding to its facts. Mr. Dick, an intelligent tradesman of\r\nThurso, agreeably occupies his hours of leisure, for a few months, in\r\ndetaching from the rocks in his neighborhood their organic remains; and\r\nthus succeeds in adding to the existing knowledge of palaeozoic life, by\r\ndisinterring ichthyolites which even Agassiz himself would delight to\r\nfigure and describe. Several of the specimens in my possession, which I\r\nowe to the kindness of Mr. Dick, are so decidedly unique, that they\r\nwould be regarded as strangers in the completest geological museums\r\nextant. It is a not uncurious fact, that when the Thurso tradesman was\r\npursuing his labors of exploration among rocks beside the Pentland\r\nFrith, a man of similar character was pursuing exactly similar labors,\r\nwith nearly similar results, among rocks of nearly the same era, that\r\nbound, on the coast of Cornwall, the British Channel. When the one was\r\nhammering in \"Ready-money Cove,\" the other, at the opposite end of the\r\nisland, was disturbing the echoes of \"Pudding-Gno;\" and scales, plates,\r\nspines, and occipital fragments of palaeozoic fishes rewarded the labors\r\nof both. In an article on the scientific meeting at York, which appeared\r\nin \"Chambers' Journal\" in the November of last year, the reading public\r\nwere introduced to a singularly meritorious naturalist, Mr. Charles\r\nPeach,[9] a private in the mounted guard (preventive service),\r\nstationed on the southern coast of Cornwall, who has made several\r\ninteresting discoveries on the outer confines of the animal kingdom,\r\nthat have added considerably to the list of our British zoophites and\r\nechinodermata. The article, a finely-toned one, redolent of that\r\npleasing sympathy which Mr. Robert Chambers has ever evinced with\r\nstruggling merit, referred chiefly to Mr. Peach's labors as a\r\nnaturalist; but he is also well known in the geological field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     Ichthyolite Beds of Clune and Lethenbarn--Limestone\r\n     Quarry--Destruction of Urns and Sarcophagi in the\r\n     Lime-kiln--Nodules opened--Beautiful coloring of the\r\n     Remains--Patrick Duff's Description--New Genus of Morayshire\r\n     Ichthyolite described--Form and size of the Nodules or Stone\r\n     Coffins--Illustration from Mrs. Marshall's Cements--Forest of\r\n     Darnaway--The Hill of Berries--Sluie--Elgin--Outliers of the Weald\r\n     and the Oolite--Description of the Weald at Linksfield--Mr. Duff's\r\n     _Lepidotus minor_--Eccentric Types of Fish Scales--Visit to the\r\n     Sandstones of Scat-Craig--Fine suit of Fossils at Scat-Craig--True\r\n     graveyard Bones, not mere Impressions--Varieties of pattern--The\r\n     Diker's \"Carved Flowers\"--_Stagonolepis_, a new genus--Termination\r\n     of the Ramble.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy term of furlough was fast drawing to a close. It was now Wednesday\r\nthe 14th August, and on Monday the 19th it behooved me to be seated at\r\nmy desk in Edinburgh. I took boat, and crossed the Moray Frith from\r\nCromarty to Nairn, and then walked on, in a very hot sun, over\r\nShakspeare's Moor to Boghole, with the intention of examining the\r\nichthyolite beds of Clune and Lethenbarn, and afterwards striking across\r\nthe country to Forres, through the forest of Darnaway, where the forest\r\nabuts on the Findhorn, at the picturesque village of Sluie. When I had\r\nlast crossed the moor, exactly ten years before, it was in a tremendous\r\nstorm of rain and wind; and the dark platform of heath and bog, with its\r\nold ruinous castle standing sentry over it, seemed greatly more worthy\r\nof the genius of the dramatist, as cloud after cloud dashed over it,\r\nlike ocean waves breaking on some low volcanic island, than it did on\r\nthis clear, breathless afternoon, in the unclouded sunshine. But the\r\nsublimity of the moor on which Macbeth met the witches depends in no\r\ndegree on that of the \"heath near Forres,\" whether seen in foul weather\r\nor fair; its topography bears relation to but the mind of Shakspeare;\r\nand neither tile-draining nor the plough will ever lessen an inch of its\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe limestone quarry of Clune has been opened on the edge of an\r\nextensive moor, about three miles from the public road, where the\r\nprovince of Moray sweeps upwards from the broad fertile belt of\r\ncorn-land that borders on the sea, to the brown and shaggy interior.\r\nThere is an old-fashioned bare-looking farm-house on the one side,\r\nsurrounded by a few uninclosed patches of corn; and the moorland, here\r\ndark with heath, there gray with lichens, stretches away on the other.\r\nThe quarry itself is merely a piece of moor that has been trenched to\r\nthe depth of some five or six feet from the surface, and that presents,\r\nat the line where the broken ground leans against the ground still\r\nunbroken, a low uneven frontage, somewhat resembling that of a ruinous\r\nstone-fence. It has been opened in the outcrop of an ichthyolite bed of\r\nthe Lower Old Red Sandstone, on which in this locality the thin moory\r\nsoil immediately rests, without the intervention of the common boulder\r\nclay of the country; and the fish-enveloping nodules, which are composed\r\nin this bed of a rich limestone, have been burnt, for a considerable\r\nnumber of years, for the purposes of the agriculturist and builder.\r\nThere was a kiln smoking this evening beside the quarry; and a\r\nfew laborers were engaged with shovel and pickaxe in cutting into\r\nthe stratified clay of the unbroken ground, and throwing up its\r\nspindle-shaped nodules on the bank, as materials for their next\r\nburning. Antiquaries have often regretted that the sculptured marble\r\nof Greece and Egypt,--classic urns, to whose keeping the ashes of\r\nthe dead had been consigned, and antique sarcophagi, roughened with\r\nhieroglyphics,--should have been so often condemned to the lime-kiln by\r\nthe illiterate Copt or tasteless Mohammedan; and I could not help\r\nexperiencing a somewhat similar feeling here. The urns and sarcophagi,\r\nmany times more ancient than those of Greece and Egypt, and that told\r\nstill more wondrous stories, lay thickly ranged in this strange\r\ncatacomb,--so thickly, that there were quite enough for the lime-kiln\r\nand the geologists too; but I found the kiln got all, and this at a time\r\nwhen the collector finds scarce any fossils more difficult to procure\r\nthan those of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. I asked one of the laborers\r\nwhether he did not preserve some of the better specimens, in the hope of\r\nfinding an occasional purchaser. Not now, he said: he used to preserve\r\nthem in the days of Lady Cumming of Altyre; but since her ladyship's\r\ndeath, no one in the neighborhood seemed to care for them, and strangers\r\nrarely came the way.\r\n\r\nThe first nodule I laid open contained a tolerably well-preserved\r\nCheiracanthus; the second, an indifferent specimen of Glyptolepis; and\r\nthree others, in succession, remains of Coccosteus. Almost every nodule\r\nof one especial layer near the top incloses its organism. The coloring\r\nis frequently of great beauty. In the Cromarty, as in the Caithness,\r\nOrkney, and Gamrie specimens, the animal matter with which the bones\r\nwere originally charged has been converted into a dark glossy bitumen,\r\nand the plates and scales glitter from a ground of opaque gray, like\r\npieces of japan-work suspended against a rough-cast wall. But here, as\r\nin the other Morayshire deposits, the plates and scales exist in nearly\r\ntheir original condition, as bone that retains its white color in the\r\ncentre of the specimens, where its bulk is greatest, and is often\r\nbeautifully tinged at its thinner edges by the iron with which the stone\r\nis impregnated. It is not rare to find some of the better preserved\r\nfossils colored in a style that reminds one of the more gaudy fishes of\r\nthe tropics. We see the body of the ichthyolite, with its finely\r\narranged scales, of a pure snow-white. Along the edges, where the\r\noriginal substance of the bone, combining with the oxide of the matrix,\r\nhas formed a phosphate of iron, there runs a delicately shaded band of\r\nplum-blue; while the out-spread fins, charged still more largely with\r\nthe oxide, are of a deep red. The description of Mr. Patrick Duff, in\r\nhis \"Geology of Moray,\" so redolent of the quiet enthusiasm of the true\r\nfossil-hunter, especially applies to the ichthyolites of this quarry,\r\nand to those of a neighboring opening in the same bed,--the quarry of\r\nLethenbarn. \"The nodules,\" says Mr. Duff, \"which in their external shape\r\nresemble the stones used in the game of curling, but are elliptical\r\nbodies instead of round, lie in the shale on their flat sides, in a line\r\nwith the dip. When taken out, they remind one of water-worn pebbles, or\r\nrather boulders of a shore. A smart blow on the edge splits them along\r\non the major axis, and exposes the interesting inclosure. The practised\r\ngeologist knows well the thrilling interest attending the breaking up of\r\nthe nodule: the uninitiated cannot sympathize with it. There is no time\r\nwhen a fossil looks so well as when first exposed. There is a clammy\r\nmoisture on the surface of the scales or plates, which brings out the\r\nbeautiful coloring, and adds brilliancy to the enamel. Exposure to the\r\nweather soon dims the lustre; and even in a cabinet an old specimen is\r\neasily known by its tarnished aspect.\"\r\n\r\nI found at Clune no ichthyolite to which the geologists have not been\r\nalready introduced, or with which I had not been acquainted previously\r\nin the Cromarty beds. The Lower Old Red of Morayshire furnishes,\r\nhowever, at least one genus not yet figured nor described, and of which,\r\nso far as I am aware, only a single specimen has yet been found. It\r\nseems to have been a small delicately-formed fish; its head covered with\r\nplates; its body with round scales of a size intermediate between those\r\nof the Osteolepis and Cheiracanthus; its anterior dorsal fin placed, as\r\nin the Dipterus, Diplopterus, and Glyptolepis, directly opposite to its\r\nventral fins; the enamelled surfaces of the minute scales were fretted\r\nwith microscopic undulating ridges, that radiated from the centre to the\r\ncircumference; similar furrows traversed the occipital plates; and the\r\nfins, unfurnished with spines, were formed, as in the Dipterus and\r\nDiplopterus, of thick-set, enamelled rays. The posterior fins and tail\r\nof the creature were not preserved. I may mention, for the satisfaction\r\nof the geologist, that I saw this unique fossil in the possession of the\r\nlate Lady Cumming of Altyre, a few weeks previous to the lamented death\r\nof her ladyship; and that, on assuring her it was as new in relation to\r\nthe Cromarty and Caithness fish-beds as to those of Moray, she intimated\r\nan intention of forthwith sending a drawing of it to Agassiz; but her\r\nuntimely decease in all probability interfered with the design, and I\r\nhave not since heard of this new genus of ichthyolite, or of her\r\nladyship's interesting specimen, hitherto apparently its only\r\nrepresentative and memorial. In the Morayshire, as in the Cromarty beds,\r\nthe limestone nodules take very generally the form of the fish which\r\nthey inclose: they are stone coffins, carefully moulded to express the\r\noutline of the corpses within. Is the fish entire?--the nodule is of a\r\nspindle form, broader at the head and narrower at the tail. Is it\r\nslightly curved, in the attitude of violent death?--the nodule has also\r\nits slight curve. Is it bent round, so that the extremities of the\r\ncreature meet?--the nodule, in conformity with the outline, is circular.\r\nIs it disjointed and broken?--the nodule is correspondingly irregular.\r\nIn nine cases out of ten, the inclosing coffin, like that of an old\r\nmummy, conforms to the outline of the organism which it incloses. It is\r\nfurther worthy of remark, too, that a large fish forms generally a\r\nlarge nodule, and a small fish a small one. Here, for instance, is a\r\nnodule fifteen inches in length, here a nodule of only three inches, and\r\nhere a nodule of intermediate size, that measures eight inches. We find\r\nthat the large nodule contains a Cheirolepis thirteen inches in length,\r\nthe small one a Diplacanthus of but two and a half inches in length, and\r\nthe intermediate one a Cheiracanthus of seven inches. The size of the\r\nfish evidently regulated that of the nodule. The coffin is generally as\r\ngood a fit in size as in form; and the bulk of the nodule bears almost\r\nalways a definite proportion to the amount of animal matter round which\r\nit had formed. I was a good deal struck, a few weeks ago, in glancing\r\nover a series of experiments conducted for a different purpose by a lady\r\nof singular ingenuity,--Mrs. Marshall, the inventor and patentee of the\r\nbeautiful marble-looking plaster, _Intonacco_,--to find what seemed a\r\nsimilar principle illustrated in the compositions of her various\r\ncements. These are all formed of a basis of lime, mixed in certain\r\nproportions with organic matter. The reader must be familiar with\r\ncements of this kind long known among the people, and much used in the\r\nrepairing of broken pottery, such as a cement compounded of quicklime\r\nmade of oyster shells, mixed up with a glue made of skim-milk cheese,\r\nand another cement made also of quicklime mixed up with the whites of\r\neggs. In Mrs. Marshall's cements, the organic matter is variously\r\ncompounded of both animal and vegetable substances, while the earth\r\ngenerally employed is sulphate of lime; and the result is a\r\nclose-grained marble-like composition, considerably harder than the\r\nsulphate in its original crystalline state. She had deposited, in one\r\nset of her experiments, the calcareous earth, mixed up with sand, clay,\r\nand other extraneous matters, on some of the commoner molluscs of our\r\nshores; and universally found that the mass, incoherent everywhere\r\nelse, had acquired solidity wherever it had been permeated by the\r\nanimal matter of the molluscs. Each animal, in proportion to its size,\r\nis found to retain, as in the fossiliferous spindles of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, its coherent nodule around it. One point in the natural\r\nphenomenon, however, still remains unillustrated by the experiments of\r\nMrs. Marshall. We see in them the animal matter giving solidity to the\r\nlime in immediate contact with it; but we do not see it possessing any\r\nsuch affinity for it as to form, in an argillaceous compound, like that\r\nof the ichthyolite beds, a centre of attraction powerful enough to draw\r\ntogether the lime diffused throughout the mass. It still remains for the\r\ngeologic chemist to discover on what principle masses of animal matter\r\nshould form the attracting nuclei of limestone nodules.\r\n\r\nThe declining sun warned me that I had lingered rather longer than was\r\nprudent among the ichthyolites of Clune; and so, striking in an eastern\r\ndirection across a flat moor, through which I found the schistose gneiss\r\nof the district protruding in masses resembling half-buried boulders, I\r\nentered the forest of Darnaway. There was no path, and much underwood,\r\nand I enjoyed the luxury of steering my course, out of sight of road and\r\nlandmark, by the sun, and of being not sure at times whether I had skill\r\nenough to play the part of the bush-ranger under his guidance. A sultry\r\nday had clarified and cooled down into a clear, balmy evening; the slant\r\nbeam was falling red on a thousand tall trunks,--here gleaming along\r\nsome bosky vista, to which the white silky wood-moths, fluttering by\r\nscores, and the midge and the mosquito dancing by myriads, imparted a\r\nmotty gold-dust atmosphere; there penetrating in straggling rays far\r\ninto some gloomy recess, and resting in patches of flame, amid the\r\ndarkness, on gnarled stem, or moss-cushioned stump, or gray beard-like\r\nlichen. I dislodged, in passing through the underwood, many a tiny\r\ntenant of the forest, that had a better right to harbor among its wild\r\nraspberries and junipers than I had to disturb them,--velvety\r\nnight-moths, that had sat with folded wings under the leaves, awaiting\r\nthe twilight, and that now took short blind flights of some two or three\r\nyards, to get out of my way,--and robust, well-conditioned spiders,\r\nwhose elastic, well-tightened lines snapped sharp before me as I pressed\r\nthrough, and then curled up on the scarce perceptible breeze, like\r\nbroken strands of wool. But every man, however Whiggish in his\r\ninclinations, entertains a secret respect for the powerful; and though I\r\npassed within a few feet of a large wasps' nest, suspended to a jutting\r\nbough of furze, the wasps I took especial care _not_ to disturb. I\r\npressed on, first through a broad belt of the forest, occupied mainly by\r\nmelancholy Scotch firs; next through an opening, in which I found an\r\nAmerican-looking village of mingled cottages, gardens, fields and wood;\r\nand then through another broad forest-belt, in which the ground is more\r\nvaried with height and hollow than in the first, and in which I found\r\nonly forest trees, mostly oaks and beeches. I heard the roar of the\r\nFindhorn before me, and premised I was soon to reach the river; but\r\nwhether I should pursue it upwards or downwards, in order to find the\r\nferry at Sluie, was more than I knew. There lay in my track a beautiful\r\nhillock, that reclines on the one side to the setting sun, and sinks\r\nsheer on the other, in a mural sandstone precipice, into the Findhorn.\r\nThe trees open over it, giving full access to the free air and the\r\nsunshine; and I found it as thickly studded over with berries as if it\r\nhad been the special care of half a dozen gardeners. The red light fell\r\nyet redder on the thickly inlaid cranberries and stone-brambles of the\r\nslope, and here and there, though so late in the season, on a patch of\r\nwild strawberries; while over all, dark, delicate blueberries, with\r\ntheir flour-bedusted coats, were studded as profusely as if they had\r\nbeen peppered over it by a hailstone cloud. I have seldom seen such a\r\nschool-boy's paradise, and I was just thinking what a rare discovery I\r\nwould have deemed it had I made it thirty years sooner, when I heard a\r\nwhooping in the wood, and four little girls, the eldest scarcely eleven,\r\ncame bounding up to the hillock, their lips and fingers already dyed\r\npurple, and dropped themselves down among the berries with a shout. They\r\nwere sadly startled to find they had got a companion in so solitary a\r\nrecess; but I succeeded in convincing them that they were in no manner\r\nof danger from him; and on asking whether there was any of them skilful\r\nenough to show me the way to Sluie, they told me they all lived there,\r\nand were on their way home from school, which they attended at the\r\nvillage in the forest. Hours had elapsed since the master had _let them\r\ngo_, but in so fine an evening the berries wouldn't, and so they were\r\nstill in the wood. I accompanied them to Sluie, and was ferried over the\r\nriver in a salmon coble. There is no point where the Findhorn,\r\ncelebrated among our Scotch streams for the beauty of its scenery, is so\r\ngenerally interesting as in the neighborhood of this village; forest and\r\nriver,--each a paragon in its kind,--uniting for several miles together\r\nwhat is most choice and characteristic in the peculiar features of both.\r\nIn no locality is the surface of the great forest of Darnaway more\r\nundulated, or its trees nobler; and nowhere does the river present a\r\nlivelier succession of eddying pools and rippling shallows, or fret\r\nitself in sweeping on its zig-zag course, now to the one bank, now to\r\nthe other, against a more picturesque and imposing series of cliffs. But\r\nto the geologist the locality possesses an interest peculiar to itself.\r\nThe precipices on both sides are charged with fossils of the Upper Old\r\nRed Sandstone: they form part of a vast indurated graveyard, excavated\r\nto the depth of an hundred feet by the ceaseless wear of the stream; and\r\nwhen the waters are low, the teeth-plates and scales of ichthyolites,\r\nall of them specifically different from those of Clune and Lethenbarn,\r\nand most of them generically so, may be disinterred from the strata in\r\nhandfuls. But the closing evening left me neither light nor time for the\r\nwork of exploration. I heard the curfew in the woods from the yet\r\ndistant town, and dark night had set in long ere I reached Forres. On\r\nthe following morning I took a seat in one of the south coaches, and got\r\non to Elgin an hour before noon.\r\n\r\nElgin, one of the finest of our northern towns, occupies the centre of a\r\nrichly fossiliferous district, which wants only better sections to rank\r\nit among the most interesting in the kingdom. An undulating platform of\r\nOld Red Sandstone, in which we see, largely developed in one locality,\r\nthe lower formation of the Coccosteus, and in another, still more\r\nlargely, the upper formation of the _Holoptychius Nobilissimus_, forms,\r\nif I may so speak, the foundation deposit of the district,--the true\r\ngeologic plane of the country; and, thickly scattered over this plane,\r\nwe find numerous detached knolls and patches of the Weald and the\r\nOolite, deposited like heaps of travelled soil, or of lime shot down by\r\nthe agriculturist on the surface of a field. The Old Red platform is\r\nmottled by the outliers of a comparatively modern time: the sepulchral\r\nmounds of later races, that lived and died during the reptile age of the\r\nworld, repose on the surface of an ancient burying-ground, charged with\r\nremains of the long anterior age of the fish; and over all, as a general\r\ncovering, rest the red boulder-clay and the vegetable mould. Mr. Duff,\r\nin his valuable \"Sketch of the Geology of Moray,\" enumerates five\r\nseveral localities in the neighborhood of Elgin in which there occur\r\noutliers of the Weald; though, of course, in a country so flat, and in\r\nwhich the diluvium lies deep, we cannot hold that all have been\r\ndiscovered. And though the outliers of the Oolite have not yet been\r\nascertained to be equally numerous, they seem of greater extent; the\r\nisolated masses detached from them by the denuding agencies lie thick\r\nover extensive areas; and in working out the course of improvement which\r\nhas already rendered Elginshire the garden of the north, the ditcher at\r\none time touches on some bed of shale charged with the characteristic\r\nAmmonites and Belemnites of the system, and at another on some\r\ncalcareous sandstone bed, abounding with its Pectens, its Plagiostoma,\r\nand its Pinnae. Some of these outliers, whether Wealden or Oolitic, are\r\nexternally of great beauty. They occur in the parish of Lhanbryde, about\r\nthree miles to the east of Elgin, in the form of green pyramidal\r\nhillocks, mottled with trees, and at Linksfield, as a confluent group of\r\nswelling grassy mounds. And from their insulated character, and the\r\nabundance of organisms which they inclose, they serve to remind one of\r\nthose green pyramids of Central America in which the traveller finds\r\ndeposited the skeleton remains of extinct races. It has been suggested\r\nby Mr. Duff, in his \"Sketch,\"--a suggestion which the late\r\nSutherlandshire discoveries of Mr. Robertson of Inverugie have tended to\r\nconfirm,--that the Oolite and Weald of Moray do not, in all probability,\r\nrepresent consecutive formations: they seem to bear the same sort of\r\nrelation to each other as that mutually borne by the Mountain Limestone\r\nand the Coal Measures. The one, of lacustrine or of estuary origin,\r\nexhibits chiefly the productions of the land and its fresh waters; the\r\nother, as decidedly of marine origin, is charged with the remains of\r\nanimals whose proper home was the sea. But the productions, though\r\ndissimilar, were in all probability contemporary, just as the crabs and\r\nperiwinkles of the Frith of Forth are contemporary with the frogs and\r\nlymnea of Flanders moss.\r\n\r\nI had little time for exploration in the neighborhood of Elgin; but that\r\nlittle, through the kindness of my friend Mr. Duff, I was enabled to\r\neconomize. We first visited together the outlier of the Weald at\r\nLinksfield. It may be found rising in the landscape, a short mile below\r\nthe town, in the form of a green undulating hillock, half cut through by\r\na limestone quarry; and the section thus furnished is of great beauty.\r\nThe basis on which the hillock rests is formed of the well-marked\r\ncalcareous band in the Upper Old Red, known as the Cornstone, which we\r\nfind occurring here, as elsewhere, as a pale concretionary limestone of\r\nconsiderable richness, though in some patches largely mixed with a green\r\nargillaceous earth, and in others passing into a siliceous chert. Over\r\nthe pale-colored base, the section of the hillock is ribbed like an\r\nonyx: for about forty feet, bands of gray, green, and blue clays\r\nalternate with bands of cream-colored, light-green, and dark-blue\r\nlimestones; and over all there rests a band of the red boulder-clay,\r\ncapped by a thin layer of vegetable mould. It is a curious circumstance,\r\nwell fitted to impress on the geologist the necessity of cautious\r\ninduction, that the boulder-clay not only _overlies_, but also\r\n_underlies_, this fresh-water deposit; a bed of unequivocally the same\r\norigin and character with that at the top lying intercalated, as if\r\nfilling up two low flat vaults, between the upper surface of the\r\nCornstone and the lower band of the Weald. It would, however, be as\r\nunsafe to infer that this intervening bed is older than the overlying\r\nones, as to infer that the rubbish which chokes up the vaulted dungeon\r\nof an old castle is more ancient than the arch that stretches over it.\r\nHowever introduced into the cavity which it occupies,--whether by\r\nland-springs or otherwise,--we find it containing fragments of the green\r\nand pale limestones that lie above, just as the rubbish of the castle\r\ndungeon might be found to contain fragments of the castle itself. When\r\nthe bed of red boulder-clay was intercalated, the rocks of the overlying\r\nWealden were exactly the same sort of indurated substances that they are\r\nnow, and were yielding to the operations of some denuding agent. The\r\nalternating clays and limestones of this outlier, each of which must\r\nhave been in turn an upper layer at the bottom of some lake or estuary,\r\nare abundantly fossiliferous. In some the fresh-water character of the\r\ndeposit is well marked: Cyprides are so exceedingly numerous in some of\r\nthe bands, that they impart to the stone an Oolitic appearance; while\r\nothers of a dark-colored limestone we see strewed over, like the oozy\r\nbottom of a modern lake, with specimens of what seem Paludina, Cyclas,\r\nand Planorbus. Some of the other shells are more equivocal: a Mytilus or\r\nModiola, which abounds in some of the bands, may have been either a sea\r\nor a fresh-water shell; and a small oyster and Astarte seem decidedly\r\nmarine. Remains of fish are very abundant,--scales, plates, teeth,\r\nichthyodorulites, and in some instances entire ichthyolites. I saw, in\r\nthe collection of Mr. Duff, a small but very entire specimen of\r\n_Lepidotus minor_, with the fins spread out on the limestone, as in an\r\nanatomical preparation, and almost every plate and scale in its place.\r\nSome of his specimens of ichthyodorulites, too, are exceedingly\r\nbeautiful, and of great size, resembling jaws thickly set with teeth,\r\nthe apparent teeth being mere knobs ranged along the concave edge of the\r\nbone, the surface of which we see gracefully fluted and enamelled. What\r\nmost struck me, however, in glancing over the drawers of Mr. Duff, was\r\nthe character of the Ganoid scales of this deposit. The Ganoid order in\r\nthe days of the Weald was growing old; and two new orders,--the Ctenoid\r\nand Cycloid,--were on the eve of taking its place in creation. Hitherto\r\nit had comprised at least two-thirds of all the fish that had existed\r\never since the period in which fish first began; and almost every Ganoid\r\nfish had its own peculiar pattern of scale. But it would now seem as if\r\nwell nigh all the simpler patterns were exhausted, and as if, in order\r\nto give the variety which nature loves, forms of the most eccentric\r\ntypes had to be resorted to. With scarce any exception save that\r\nfurnished by the scales of the _Lepidotus minor_, which are plain\r\nlozenge-shaped plates, thickly japanned, the forms are strangely complex\r\nand irregular, easily expressible by the pencil, but beyond the reach of\r\nthe pen. The remains of reptiles have been found occasionally, though\r\nrarely, in this outlier of the Weald,--the vertebra of a Plesiosaurus,\r\nthe femur of some Chelonian reptile, and a large fluted tooth, supposed\r\nSaurian.\r\n\r\nI would fain have visited some of the neighboring outliers of the\r\nOolite, but time did not permit. Mr. Duff's collection, however, enabled\r\nme to form a tolerably adequate estimate of their organic contents.\r\nViewed in the group, these present nearly the same aspect as the\r\norganisms of the Upper Lias of Pabba. There is in the same abundance\r\nlarge Pinnae, and well-relieved Pectens, both ribbed and smooth; the same\r\nabundance, too, of Belemnites and Ammonites of resembling type. Both the\r\nMoray outliers and the Pabba deposit have their Terebratulae, Gervilliae,\r\nPlagiostoma, Cardiadae, their bright Ganoid scales, and their\r\nimperfectly-preserved lignites. They belong apparently to nearly the\r\nsame period, and must have been formed in nearly similar\r\ncircumstances,--the one on the western, the other on the eastern coast\r\nof a country then covered by the vegetation of the Oolite, and now\r\nknown, with reference to an antiquity of but yesterday, as the ancient\r\nkingdom of Scotland. I saw among the Ammonites of these outliers at\r\nleast one species, which, I believe, has not yet been found elsewhere,\r\nand which has been named, after Mr. Robertson of Inverugie, the\r\ngentleman who first discovered it, _Ammonites Robertsoni_. Like most of\r\nthe genus to which it belongs, it is an exceedingly beautiful shell,\r\nwith all its whorls free and gracefully ribbed, and bearing on its back,\r\nas its distinguishing specific peculiarity, a triple keel. I spent the\r\nevening of this day in visiting, with Mr. Duff, the Upper Old Red\r\nSandstones of Scat-Craig. In Elginshire, as in Fife and elsewhere, the\r\nUpper Old Red consists of three grand divisions,--a superior bed of pale\r\nyellow sandstone, which furnishes the finest building-stone anywhere\r\nfound in the north of Scotland,--an intermediate calcareous bed, known\r\ntechnically as the Cornstone,--and an inferior bed of sandstone,\r\nchiefly, in this locality, of a grayish-red color, and generally very\r\nincoherent in its structure. The three beds, as shown by the fossil\r\ncontents of the yellow sandstones above, and of the grayish-red\r\nsandstones below, are members of the same formation,--a formation which,\r\nin Scotland at least, does not possess an organism in common with the\r\nMiddle Old Red formation; that of the Cephalaspis, as developed in\r\nForfarshire, Stirling, and Ayr, or the Lower Old Red formation; that of\r\nthe Coccosteus, as developed in Caithness, Cromarty, Inverness, and\r\nBanff shires, and in so many different localities in Moray. The\r\nSandstones at Scat-Craig belong to the grayish-red base of the Upper Old\r\nRed formation. They lie about five miles south of Elgin, not far distant\r\nfrom where the palaeozoic deposits of the coast-side lean against the\r\ngreat primary nucleus of the interior. We pass from the town, through\r\ndeep rich fields, carefully cultivated and well inclosed: the country,\r\nas we advance on the moorlands, becomes more open; the homely cottage\r\ntakes the place of the neat villa; the brown heath, of the grassy lea;\r\nand unfenced patches of corn here and there alternate with plantings of\r\ndark sombre firs, in their mediocre youth. At length we near the\r\nsouthern boundary of the landscape,--an undulating moory ridge,\r\npartially planted; and see where a deep gap in the outline opens a way\r\nto the upland districts of the province, a lively hill-stream descending\r\ntowards the east through the bed which it has scooped out for itself in\r\na soft red conglomerate. The section we have come to explore lies along\r\nits course: it has been the grand excavator in the densely occupied\r\nburial-ground over which it flows; but its labors have produced but a\r\nshallow scratch after all,--a mere ditch, some ten or twelve feet deep,\r\nin a deposit the entire depth of which is supposed greatly to exceed a\r\nhundred fathoms. The shallow section, however, has been well wrought;\r\nand its suit of fossils is one of the finest, both from the great\r\nspecific variety which they exhibit, and their excellent state of\r\nkeeping, that the Upper Old Red Sandstone has anywhere furnished.\r\n\r\nSo great is the incoherency of the matrix, that we can dig into it with\r\nour chisels, unassisted by the hammer. It reminds us of the loose\r\ngravelly soil of an ancient graveyard, partially consolidated by a\r\nnight's frost,--a resemblance still further borne out by the condition\r\nand appearance of its organic contents. The numerous bones disseminated\r\nthroughout the mass do not exist, as in so many of the Upper Old Red\r\nSandstone rocks, as mere films or impressions, but in their original\r\nforms, retaining bulk as well as surface: they are true graveyard bones,\r\nwhich may be detached entire from the inclosing mass, and of which, were\r\nwe sufficiently well acquainted with the anatomy of the long-perished\r\nraces to which they belonged, entire skeletons might be reconstructed.\r\nI succeeded in disinterring, during my short stay, an occipital plate of\r\ngreat beauty, fretted on its outer surface by numerous tubercles,\r\nconfluent on its anterior part, and surrounded on its posterior portion,\r\nwhere they stand detached, by punctulated markings. I found also a fine\r\nscale of _Holoptychius Nobilissimus_, and a small tooth, bent somewhat\r\nlike a nail that had been drawn out of its place by two opposite\r\nwrenches, and from the internal structure of which Professor Owen has\r\nbestowed on the animal to which it belonged the generic name Dendrodus.\r\nI have ascertained, however, through the indispensable assistance of Mr.\r\nGeorge Sanderson, that the genus Holoptychius of Agassiz, named from a\r\npeculiarity in the sculpture of the scale, is the identical genus\r\nDendrodus of Professor Owen, named from a peculiarity in the structure\r\nof the teeth. Those teeth of the genus Holoptychius, whether of the\r\nLower or Upper Old Red, that belong to the second or _reptile_ row with\r\nwhich the creature's jaws were furnished, present in the cross section\r\nthe appearance of numerous branches, like those of trees, radiating from\r\na centre like spokes from the nave of a wheel; and their arborescent\r\naspect suggested to the Professor the name Dendrodus. It seems truly\r\nwonderful, when one but considers it, to what minute and obscure\r\nramifications the variety of pattern, specific and generic, which nature\r\nso loves to preserve, is found to descend. We see great diversity of\r\nmode and style in the architecture of a city built of brick; but while\r\nthe houses are different, the bricks are always the same. It is not so\r\nin nature. The bricks are as dissimilar as the houses. We find, for\r\ninstance, those differences, specific and generic, that obtain among\r\nfishes, both recent and extinct, descending to even the microscopic\r\nstructure of their teeth. There is more variety of pattern,--in most\r\ncases of very elegant pattern,--in the sliced fragments of the teeth of\r\nthe ichthyolites of a single formation, than in the carved blocks of an\r\nextensive calico-print yard. Each species has its own distinct pattern,\r\nas if in all the individuals of which it consisted the same block had\r\nbeen employed to stamp it; each genus has its own general _type_ of\r\npattern, as if the same inventive idea, variously altered and modified,\r\nhad been wrought upon in all. In the genus Dendrodus, for instance, it\r\nis the generic type, that from a central nave there should radiate,\r\nspoke-like, a number of leafy branches; but in the several species, the\r\nbranches, if I may so express myself, belong to different shrubs, and\r\npresent dissimilar outlines. There are no repetitions of earlier\r\npatterns to be found among the generically different ichthyolites of\r\nother formations. We see in the world of fashion old modes of ornament\r\ncontinually reviving: the range of invention seems limited; and we find\r\nit revolving, in consequence, in an irregular, ever-returning cycle. But\r\nInfinite resource did not need to travel in a circle, and so we find no\r\nreturn or doublings in its course. It has appeared to me, that an\r\nargument against the transmutation of species, were any such needed,\r\nmight be founded on those inherent peculiarities of structure that are\r\nascertained thus to pervade the entire texture of the framework of\r\nanimals. If we find one building differing from another merely in\r\nexternal form, we have no difficulty in conceiving how, by additions and\r\nalterations, they might be made to present a uniform appearance;\r\ntransmutation, development, progression,--if one may use such\r\nterms,--seem possible in such circumstances. But if the buildings differ\r\nfrom each other, not only in external form, but also in every brick and\r\nbeam, bolt and nail, no mere scheme of external alteration can induce a\r\nreal resemblance. Every brick must be taken down, and every beam and\r\nbelt removed. The problem cannot be wrought by the remodelling of an old\r\nhouse: there is no other mode of solving it save by the erection of a\r\nnew one.\r\n\r\nAmong the singularly interesting Old Red fossils of Mr. Duff's\r\ncollection I saw the impression of a large ichthyolite from the superior\r\nyellow sandstone of the Upper Old Red, which had been brought him by a\r\ncountry diker only a few days before. In breaking open a building stone,\r\nthe diker had found the inside of it, he said, covered over with\r\ncuriously carved flowers; and, knowing that Mr. Duff had a turn for\r\ncuriosities, he had brought the flowers to him. The supposed flowers are\r\nthe sculpturings on the scales of the ichthyolite; and, true to the\r\nanalogy of the diker, on at least a first glance, they may be held to\r\nresemble the rather equivocal florets of a cheap wall-paper, or of an\r\nornamental tile. The specimen exhibits the impressions of four rows of\r\noblong rectangular scales. One row contains seven of these, and another\r\neight. Each scale averages about an inch and a quarter in length, by\r\nabout three quarters of an inch in breadth; and the parallelogramical\r\nfield which it presents is occupied by a curious piece of carving. By a\r\nsort of pictorial illusion, the device appears as if in motion: it would\r\nseem as if a sudden explosion had taken place in the middle of the\r\nfield, and as if the numerous dislodged fragments, propelled all around\r\nby the central force, were hurrying to the sides. But these seeming\r\nfragments were not elevations in the original scale, but depressions.\r\nThey almost seem as if they had been indented into it, in the way one\r\nsees the first heavy drops of a thunder shower indented into a platform\r\nof damp sea sand; and this last peculiarity of appearance seems to have\r\nsuggested the name which this sole representative of an extinct genus\r\nhas received during the course of the last few weeks from Agassiz. An\r\nElgin gentleman forwarded to Neufchatel a singularly fine calotype of\r\nthe fossil, taken by Mr. Adamson of Edinburgh, with a full-size drawing\r\nof a few of the scales; and from the calotype and the drawing the\r\nnaturalist has decided that the genus is entirely new, and that\r\nhenceforth it shall bear the descriptive name of Stagonolepis, or\r\ndrop-scale. As I looked for the first time on this broken fragment of an\r\nichthyolite,--the sole representative and record of an entire genus of\r\ncreatures that had been once called into existence to fulfil some wise\r\npurpose of the Creator long since accomplished,--I bethought me of\r\nRogers's noble lines on the Torso,--\r\n\r\n \"And dost thou still, thou mass of breathing stone,\r\n (Thy giant limbs to night and chaos hurled)\r\n Still sit as on the fragment of a world,\r\n Surviving all?\"\r\n\r\nHere, however, was a still more wonderful Torso than that of the\r\ndismembered Hercules, which so awakened the enthusiasm of the poet.\r\nStrange peculiarities of being,--singular habits, curious instincts, the\r\nhistory of a race from the period when the all-producing Word had spoken\r\nthe first individuals into being, until, in circumstances unfitted for\r\ntheir longer existence, or in some great annihilating catastrophe, the\r\nlast individuals perished,--were all associated with this piece of\r\nsculptured stone; but, like some ancient inscription of the desert,\r\nwritten in an unknown character and dead tongue, its dark meanings were\r\nfast locked up, and no inhabitant of earth possessed the key. Does that\r\nkey anywhere exist, save in the keeping of Him who knows all and\r\nproduced all, and to whom there is neither past nor future? Or is there\r\na record of creation kept by those higher intelligences,--the first-born\r\nof spiritual natures,--whose existence stretches far into the eternity\r\nthat has gone by, and who possess, as their inheritance, the whole of\r\nthe eternity to come? We may be at least assured, that nothing can be\r\ntoo low for angels to remember, that was not too low for God to create.\r\n\r\nI took coach for Edinburgh on the following morning; for with my visit\r\nto Scat-Craig terminated the explorations of my Summer Ramble. During\r\nthe summer of the present year I have found time to follow up some of\r\nthe discoveries of the last. In the course of a hasty visit to the\r\nisland of Eigg, I succeeded in finding _in situ_ reptile remains of the\r\nkind which I had found along the shores in the previous season, in\r\ndetached water-rolled masses. The deposit in which they occur lies deep\r\nin the Oolite. In some parts of the island there rest over it\r\nalternations of beds of trap and sedimentary strata, to the height of\r\nmore than a thousand feet; but in the line of coast which intervenes\r\nbetween the farm-house of Keill and the picturesque shieling described\r\nin my fifth chapter, it has been laid bare by the sea immediately under\r\nthe cliffs, and we may see it jutting out at a low angle from among the\r\nshingle and rolled stones of the beach for several hundred feet\r\ntogether, charged everywhere with the teeth, plates, and scales of\r\nGanoid fishes, and somewhat more sparingly, with the ribs, vertebrae, and\r\ndigital bones of saurians. But a full description of this interesting\r\ndeposit, as its discovery belongs to the Summer Ramble of a year, the\r\nramblings of which are not yet completed, must await some future time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY.\r\n\r\n     Supplementary--Isolated reptile Remains in Eigg--Small Isles\r\n     revisited--The Betsey again--Storm bound--Tacking--Becalmed--Medusae\r\n     caught and described--Rain--A Shoal of Porpoises--Change of\r\n     Weather--The bed-ridden Woman--The Poor Law Act for\r\n     Scotland--Geological Excursion--Basaltic Columns--Oolitic\r\n     Beds--Abundance of Organic Remains--Hybodus Teeth--Discovery of\r\n     reptile Remains _in situ_--Musical Sand of Laig\r\n     re-examined--Explanation suggested--Sail for Isle Ornsay--Anchored\r\n     Clouds--A Leak sprung--Peril of the Betsey--At work with Pump and\r\n     Pails--Safe in Harbor--Return to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is told of the \"Spectator,\" on his own high authority, that having\r\n\"read the controversies of some great men concerning the antiquities of\r\nEgypt, he made a voyage to Grand Cairo, on purpose to take the measure\r\nof a pyramid, and that, so soon as he had set himself right in that\r\nparticular, he returned to his native country with great satisfaction.\"\r\nMy love of knowledge has not carried me altogether so far, chiefly, I\r\ndare say, because my voyaging opportunities have not been quite so\r\ngreat. Ever since my ramble of last year, however, I have felt, I am\r\nafraid, a not less interest in the geologic antiquities of Small Isles\r\nthan that cherished by \"Spectator\" with respect to the comparatively\r\nmodern antiquities of Egypt; and as, in a late journey to these islands\r\nthe object of my visit involved but a single point, nearly as insulated\r\nas the dimensions of a pyramid, I think I cannot do better than shelter\r\nmyself under the authority of the short-faced gentleman who wrote\r\narticles in the reign of Queen Anne. I had found in Eigg, in\r\nconsiderable abundance and fine keeping, reptile remains of the Oolite;\r\nbut they had occurred in merely rolled masses, scattered along the\r\nbeach. I had not discovered the bed in which they had been originally\r\ndeposited, and could neither tell its place in the system, nor its\r\nrelation to the other rocks of the island. The discovery was but a\r\nhalf-discovery,--the half of a broken medal, with the date on the\r\nmissing portion. And so, immediately after the rising of the General\r\nAssembly in June last [1845], I set out to revisit Small Isles,\r\naccompanied by my friend Mr. Swanson, with the determination of\r\nacquainting myself with the burial-place of the old Oolitic reptiles, if\r\nit lay anywhere open to the light.\r\n\r\nWe found the Betsey riding in the anchoring ground at Isle Ornsay, in\r\nher foul-weather dishabille, with her topmast struck and in the yard,\r\nand her cordage and sides exhibiting in their weathered aspect the\r\ninfluence of the bleaching rains and winds of the previous winter. She\r\nwas at once in an undress and getting old, and, as seen from the shore\r\nthrough rain and spray,--for the weather was coarse and boisterous,--she\r\nhad apparently gained as little in her good looks from either\r\ncircumstance as most other ladies do. We lay storm-bound for three days\r\nat Isle Ornsay, watching from the window of Mr. Swanson's dwelling the\r\nincessant showers sweeping down the loch. On the morning of Saturday,\r\nthe gale, though still blowing right ahead, had moderated; the minister\r\nwas anxious to visit this island charge, after his absence of several\r\nweeks from them at the Assembly; and I, more than half afraid that my\r\nterm of furlough might expire ere I had reached my proposed scene of\r\nexploration, was as anxious as he; and so we both resolved, come what\r\nmight, on doggedly beating our way adown the Sound of Sleat to Small\r\nIsles. If the wind does not fail us, said my friend, we have little\r\nmore than a day's work before us, and shall get into Eigg about\r\nmidnight. We had but one of our seamen aboard, for John Stewart was\r\nengaged with his potato crop at home; but the minister was content, in\r\nthe emergency, to rank his passenger as an able-bodied seaman; and so,\r\nhoisting sail and anchor, we got under way, and, clearing the loch,\r\nstruck out into the Sound.\r\n\r\nWe tacked in long reaches for several hours, now opening up in\r\nsuccession the deep withdrawing lochs of the mainland, now clearing\r\npromontory after promontory in the island district of Sleat. In a few\r\nhours we had left a bulky schooner, that had quitted Isle Ornsay at the\r\nsame time, full five miles behind us; but as the sun began to decline,\r\nthe wind began to sink; and about seven o'clock, when we were nearly\r\nabreast of the rocky point of Sleat, and about half-way advanced in our\r\nvoyage, it had died into a calm; and for full twenty hours thereafter\r\nthere was no more sailing for the Betsey. We saw the sun set, and the\r\nclouds gather, and the pelting rain come down, and nightfall, and\r\nmorning break, and the noon-tide hour pass by, and still were we\r\nfloating idly in the calm. I employed the few hours of the Saturday\r\nevening that intervened between the time of our arrest and nightfall, in\r\nfishing from our little boat for medusae with a bucket. They had risen by\r\nmyriads from the bottom as the wind fell, and were mottling the green\r\ndepths of the water below and around far as the eye could reach. Among\r\nthe commoner kinds,--the kind with the four purple rings on the area of\r\nits flat bell, which ever vibrates without sound, and the kind with the\r\nfringe of dingy brown, and the long stinging tails, of which I have\r\nsometimes borne from my swimming excursions the nettle-like smart for\r\nhours,--there were at least two species of more unusual occurrence, both\r\nof them very minute. The one, scarcely larger than a shilling, bore the\r\ncommon umbiliferous form, but had its area inscribed by a pretty\r\norange-colored wheel; the other, still more minute, and which presented\r\nin the water the appearance of a small hazel-nut of a brownish-yellow\r\nhue, I was disposed to set down as a species of beroe. On getting one\r\ncaught, however, and transferred to a bowl, I found that the\r\nbrownish-colored, melon-shaped mass, though ribbed like the beroe, did\r\nnot represent the true outline of the animal; it formed merely the\r\ncentre of a transparent gelatinous bell, which, though scarce visible in\r\neven the bowl, proved a most efficient instrument of motion. Such were\r\nits contractile powers, that its sides nearly closed at every stroke,\r\nbehind the opaque orbicular centre, like the legs of a vigorous swimmer;\r\nand the animal, unlike its more bulky congeners,--that, despite their\r\nslow but persevering flappings, seemed greatly at the mercy of the tide,\r\nand progressed all one way,--shot, as it willed, backwards, forwards, or\r\nathwart. As the evening closed, and the depths beneath presented a\r\ndingier and yet dingier green, until at length all had become black, the\r\ndistinctive colors of the acelpha,--the purple, the orange, and the\r\nbrown,--faded and disappeared, and the creatures hung out, instead,\r\ntheir pale phosphoric lights, like the lanterns of a fleet hoisted high\r\nto prevent collision in the darkness. Now they gleamed dim and\r\nindistinct as they drifted undisturbed through the upper depths, and now\r\nthey flamed out bright and green, like beaten torches, as the tide\r\ndashed them against the vessel's sides. I bethought me of the gorgeous\r\ndescription of Coleridge, and felt all its beauty:--\r\n\r\n \"They moved in tracks of shining white,\r\n And when they reared, the elfish light\r\n   Fell off in hoary flakes.\r\n Within the shadow of the ship\r\n   I watched their rich attire,--\r\n Blue, glassy green, and velvet black:\r\n They curled, and swam, and every track\r\n   Was a flash of golden fire.\"\r\n\r\nA crew of three, when there are watches to set, divides wofully ill. As\r\nthere was, however, nothing to do in the calm, we decided that our first\r\nwatch should consist of our single seaman, and the second of the\r\nminister and his friend. The clouds, which had been thickening for\r\nhours, now broke in torrents of rain, and old Alister got into his\r\nwater-proof oil-skin and souwester, and we into our beds. The seams of\r\nthe Betsey's deck had opened so sadly during the past winter, as to be\r\nno longer water-tight, and the little cabin resounded drearily in the\r\ndarkness, like some dropping cave, to the ceaseless patter of the\r\nleakage. We continued to sleep, however, somewhat longer than we\r\nought,--for Alister had been unwilling to waken the minister; but we at\r\nlength got up, and, relieving watch the first from the tedium of being\r\nrained upon and doing nothing, watch the second was set to do nothing\r\nand be rained upon in turn. We had drifted during the night-time on a\r\nkindly tide, considerably nearer our island, which we could now see\r\nlooming blue and indistinct through the haze some seven or eight miles\r\naway. The rain ceased a little before nine, and the clouds rose,\r\nrevealing the surrounding lands, island and main,--Rum, with its abrupt\r\nmountain-peaks,--the dark Cuchullins of Skye,--and, far to the\r\nsouth-east, where Inverness bounds on Argyllshire, some of the tallest\r\nhills in Scotland,--among the rest, the dimly-seen Ben-Wevis. But long\r\nwreaths of pale gray cloud lay lazily under their summits, like shrouds\r\nhalf drawn from off the features of the dead, to be again spread over\r\nthem, and we concluded that the dry weather had not yet come. A little\r\nbefore noon we were surrounded for miles by an immense but\r\nthinly-spread shoal of porpoises, passing in pairs to the south, to\r\nprosecute, on their own behalf, the herring fishing in Lochfine or\r\nGareloch; and for a full hour the whole sea, otherwise so silent, became\r\nvocal with long-breathed blowings, as if all the steam-tenders of all\r\nthe railways in Britain were careering around us; and we could see\r\nslender jets of spray rising in the air on every side, and glossy black\r\nbacks and pointed fins, that looked as if they had been fashioned out of\r\nKilkenny marble, wheeling heavily along the surface. The clouds again\r\nbegan to close as the shoal passed, but we could now hear in the\r\nstillness the measured sound of oars, drawn vigorously against the\r\ngunwale in the direction of the island of Eigg, still about five miles\r\ndistant, though the boat from which they rose had not yet come in sight.\r\n\"Some of my poor people,\" said the minister, \"coming to tug us ashore!\"\r\nWe were boarded in rather more than half an hour after,--for the sounds\r\nin the dead calm had preceded the boat by miles,--by four active young\r\nmen, who seemed wonderfully glad to see their pastor; and then, amid the\r\nthickening showers, which had recommenced heavy as during the night,\r\nthey set themselves to tow us into the harbor. The poor fellows had a\r\nlong and fatiguing pull, and were thoroughly drenched ere, about six\r\no'clock in the evening, we had got up to our anchoring ground, and\r\nmoored, as usual, in the open tideway between _Eilan Chasteil_ and the\r\nmain island. There was still time enough for an evening discourse, and\r\nthe minister, getting out of his damp clothes, went ashore and preached.\r\n\r\nThe evening of Sunday closed in fog and rain, and in fog and rain the\r\nmorning of Monday arose. The ceaseless patter made dull music on deck\r\nand skylight above, and the slower drip, drip, through the leaky beams,\r\ndrearily beat time within. The roof of my bed was luckily water-tight;\r\nand I could look out from my snuggery of blankets on the desolations of\r\nthe leakage, like Bacon's philosopher surveying a tempest from the\r\nshore. But the minister was somewhat less fortunate, and had no little\r\ntrouble in diverting an ill-conditioned drop that had made a dead set at\r\nhis pillow. I was now a full week from Edinburgh, and had seen and done\r\nnothing; and, were another week to pass after the same manner,--as, for\r\naught that appeared, might well happen,--I might just go home again, as\r\nI had come, with my labor for my pains. In the course of the afternoon,\r\nhowever, the weather unexpectedly cleared up, and we set out somewhat\r\nimpatiently through the wet grass, to visit a cave a few hundred yards\r\nto the west of _Naomh Fraingh_, in which it had been said the\r\nProtestants of the island might meet for the purposes of religious\r\nworship, were they to be ejected from the cottage erected by Mr.\r\nSwanson, in which they had worshipped hitherto. We reexamined, in the\r\npassing, the pitch stone dike mentioned in a former chapter, and the\r\ncharnel cave of Frances; but I found nothing to add to my former\r\ndescriptions, and little to modify, save that perhaps the cave appeared\r\nless dark, in at least the outer half of its area, than it had seemed to\r\nme in the former year, when examined by torch-light, and that the\r\nstraggling twilight, as it fell on the ropy sides, green with moss and\r\nmould, and on the damp bone-strewn floor, overmantled with a still\r\ndarker crust, like that of a stagnant pool, seemed also to wear its tint\r\nof melancholy greenness, as if transmitted through a depth of sea-water.\r\nThe cavern we had come to examine we found to be a noble arched opening\r\nin a dingy-colored precipice of augitic trap,--a cave roomy and lofty as\r\nthe nave of a cathedral, and ever resounding to the dash of the sea; but\r\nthough it could have amply accommodated a congregation of at least five\r\nhundred, we found the way far too long and difficult for at least the\r\nweak and the elderly, and in some places inaccessible at full flood; and\r\nso we at once decided against the accommodation which it offered. But\r\nits shelter will, I trust, scarce be needed.\r\n\r\nOn our return to the Betsey, we passed through a straggling group of\r\ncottages on the hill-side, one of which, the most dilapidated and\r\nsmallest of the number, the minister entered, to visit a poor old woman,\r\nwho had been bed-ridden for ten years. Scarce ever before had I seen so\r\nmiserable a hovel. It was hardly larger than the cabin of the Betsey,\r\nand a thousand times less comfortable. The walls and roof, formed of\r\ndamp grass-grown turf, with a few layers of unconnected stone in the\r\nbasement tiers, seemed to constitute one continuous hillock, sloping\r\nupwards from foundation to ridge, like one of the lesser moraines of\r\nAgassiz, save where the fabric here and there bellied outwards or\r\ninwards, in perilous dilapidation, that seemed but awaiting the first\r\nbreeze. The low chinky door opened direct into the one wretched\r\napartment of the hovel, which we found lighted chiefly by holes in the\r\nroof. The back of the sick woman's bed was so placed at the edge of the\r\nopening, that it had formed at one time a sort of partition to the\r\nportion of the apartment, some five or six feet square, which contained\r\nthe fire-place; but the boarding that had rendered it such had long\r\nsince fallen away, and it now presented merely a naked rickety frame to\r\nthe current of cold air from without. Within a foot of the bed-ridden\r\nwoman's head there was a hole in the turf-wall, which was, we saw,\r\nusually stuffed with a bundle of rags, but which lay open as we entered,\r\nand which furnished a downward peep of sea and shore, and the rocky\r\n_Eilan Chasteil_, with the minister's yacht riding in the channel hard\r\nby. The little hole in the wall had formed the poor creature's only\r\ncommunication with the face of the external world for ten weary years.\r\nShe lay under a dingy coverlet, which, whatever its original hue, had\r\ncome to differ nothing in color from the graveyard earth, which must so\r\nsoon better supply its place. What perhaps first struck the eye was the\r\nstrange flatness of the bed-clothes, considering that a human body lay\r\nbelow: there seemed scarce bulk enough under them for a human skeleton.\r\nThe light of the opening fell on the corpse-like features of the\r\nwoman,--sallow, sharp, bearing at once the stamp of disease and of\r\nfamine; and yet it was evident, notwithstanding, that they had once been\r\nagreeable,--not unlike those of her daughter, a good-looking girl of\r\neighteen, who, when we entered, was sitting beside the fire. Neither\r\nmother nor daughter had any English; but it was not difficult to\r\ndetermine, from the welcome with which the minister was greeted from the\r\nsick-bed, feeble as the tones were, that he was no unfrequent visitor.\r\nHe prayed beside the poor creature, and, on coming away, slipped\r\nsomething into her hand. I learned that not during the ten years in\r\nwhich she had been bed-ridden had she received a single farthing from\r\nthe proprietor, nor, indeed, had any of the poor of the island, and that\r\nthe parish had no session-funds. I saw her husband a few days after,--an\r\nold worn-out man, with famine written legibly in his hollow cheek and\r\neye, and on the shrivelled frame, that seemed lost in his tattered\r\ndress; and he reiterated the same sad story. They had no means of\r\nliving, he said, save through the charity of their poor neighbors, who\r\nhad so little to spare; for the parish or the proprietor had never given\r\nthem anything. He had once, he added, two fine boys, both sailors, who\r\nhad helped them; but the one had perished in a storm off the Mull of\r\nCantyre, and the other had died of fever when on a West India voyage;\r\nand though their poor girl was very dutiful, and staid in their crazy\r\nhut to take care of them in their helpless old age, what other could she\r\ndo in a place like Eigg than just share with them their sufferings? It\r\nhas been recently decided by the British Parliament, that in cases of\r\nthis kind the starving poor shall not be permitted to enter the law\r\ncourts of the country, there to sue for a pittance to support life,\r\nuntil an intermediate newly-erected court, alien to the Constitution,\r\nbefore which they must plead at their own expense, shall have first\r\ngiven them permission to prosecute their claims. And I doubt not that\r\nmany of the English gentlemen whose votes swelled the majority, and made\r\nit such, are really humane men, friendly to an equal-handed justice, and\r\nwho hold it to be the peculiar glory of the Constitution, as well shown\r\nby De Lolme, that it has not one statute-book for the poor, and another\r\nfor the rich, but the same law and the same administration of law for\r\nall. They surely could not have seen that the principle of their Poor\r\nLaw Act for Scotland sets the pauper beyond the pale of the Constitution\r\nin the first instance, that he may be starved in the second. The\r\nsuffering paupers of this miserable island cottage would have all their\r\nwants fully satisfied in the grave, long ere they could establish at\r\ntheir own expense, at Edinburgh, their claim to enter a court of law. I\r\nknow not a fitter case for the interposition of our lately formed\r\n\"Scottish Association for the Protection of the Poor\" than that of this\r\nmiserable family; and it is but one of many which the island of Eigg\r\nwill be found to furnish.\r\n\r\nAfter a week's weary waiting, settled weather came at last; and the\r\nmorning of Tuesday rose bright and fair. My friend, whose absence at the\r\nGeneral Assembly had accumulated a considerable amount of ministerial\r\nlabor on his hands, had to employ the day professionally; and as John\r\nStewart was still engaged with his potato crop, I was necessitated to\r\nsally out on my first geological excursion alone. In passing\r\nvessel-wards, on the previous year, from the _Ru Stoir_ to the\r\nfarm-house of Keill, along the escarpment under the cliffs, I had\r\nexamined the shores somewhat too cursorily during the one-half of my\r\njourney, and the closing evening had prevented me from exploring them\r\nduring the other half at all; and I now set myself leisurely to retrace\r\nthe way backwards from the farm-house to the _Stoir_. I descended to the\r\nbottom of the cliffs, along the pathway which runs between Keill and the\r\nsolitary midway shieling formerly described, and found that the basaltic\r\ncolumns over head, which had seemed so picturesque in the twilight, lost\r\nnone of their beauty when viewed by day. They occur in forms the most\r\nbeautiful and fantastic; here grouped beside some blind opening in the\r\nprecipice, like pillars cut round the opening of a tomb, on some\r\nrock-front in Petraea; there running in long colonnades, or rising into\r\ntall porticoes; yonder radiating in straight lines from some common\r\ncentre, resembling huge pieces of fan-work, or bending out in bold\r\ncurves over some shaded chasm, like rows of crooked oaks projecting from\r\nthe steep sides of some dark ravine. The various beds of which the\r\ncliffs are composed, as courses of ashlar compose a wall, are of very\r\ndifferent degrees of solidity: some are of hard porphyritic or basaltic\r\ntrap; some of soft Oolitic sandstone or shale. Where the columns rest on\r\na soft stratum, their foundations have in many places given way, and\r\nwhole porticoes and colonnades hang perilously forward in tottering\r\nruin, separated from the living rock behind by deep chasms. I saw one of\r\nthese chasms, some five or six feet in width, and many yards in length,\r\nthat descended to a depth which the eye could not penetrate; and another\r\npartially filled up with earth and stones, through which, along a dark\r\nopening not much larger than a chimney-vent, the boys of the island find\r\na long descending passage to the foot of the precipice, and emerge into\r\nlight on the edge of the grassy talus half-way down the hill. It\r\nreminded me of the tunnel in the rock through which Imlac opened up a\r\nway of escape to Rasselas from the happy valley,--the \"subterranean\r\npassage,\" begun \"where the summit hung over the middle part,\" and that\r\n\"issued out behind the prominence.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the range of cliffs, on half-way to the\r\nshieling, I found the shore so thickly covered up by masses of trap, the\r\ndebris of the precipices above, that I could scarce determine the nature\r\nof the bottom on which they rested. I now, however, reached a part of\r\nthe beach where the Oolitic beds are laid bare in thin party-colored\r\nstrata, and at once found something to engage me. Organisms in vast\r\nabundance, chiefly shells and fragmentary portions of fishes, lie\r\nclosely packed in their folds. One limestone bed, occurring in a dark\r\nshale, seems almost entirely composed of a species of small oyster; and\r\nsome two or three other thin beds, of what appears to be either a\r\nspecies of small Mytilus or Avicula, mixed up with a few shells\r\nresembling large Paludina, and a few more of the gaper family, so\r\nclosely resembling existing species, that John Stewart and Alister at\r\nonce challenged them as _smurslin_, the Hebridean name for a well-known\r\nshell in these parts,--the _Mya truncata_. The remains of\r\nfishes,--chiefly Ganoid scales and the teeth of Placoids,--lie scattered\r\namong the shells in amazing abundance. On the surface of a single\r\nfragment, about nine inches by five, which I detached from one of the\r\nbeds, and which now lies before me, I reckon no fewer than twenty-five\r\nteeth, and twenty-two on the area of another. They are of very various\r\nforms,--some of them squat and round, like ill-formed small\r\nshot,--others spiky and sharp, not unlike flooring nails,--some straight\r\nas needles, some bent like the beak of a hawk,--some, like the palatal\r\nteeth of the Acrodus of the Lias, resemble small leeches; some, bearing\r\na series of points ranged on a common base, like masts on the hull of a\r\nvessel, the tallest in the centre, belong to the genus Hybodus. There is\r\na palpable approximation in the teeth of the leech-like form to the\r\nteeth with the numerous points. Some of the specimens show the same\r\nplicated structure common to both; and on some of the leech backs, if I\r\nmay so speak, there are protuberant knobs, that indicate the places of\r\nthe spiky points on the hybodent teeth. I have got three of each kind\r\nslit up by Mr. George Sanderson, and the internal structure appears to\r\nbe the same. A dense body of bone is traversed by what seem innumerable\r\nroots, resembling those of woody shrubs laid bare along the sides of\r\nsome forest stream. Each internal opening sends off on every side its\r\nmyriads of close-laid filaments; and nowhere do they lie so thickly as\r\nin the line of the enamel, forming, from the regularity with which they\r\nare arranged, a sort of framing to the whole section. It is probable\r\nthat the Hybodus,--a genus of shark which became extinct some time about\r\nthe beginning of the chalk,--united, like the shark of Port Jackson, a\r\ncrushing apparatus of palatal teeth to its lines of cutting ones. Among\r\nthe other remains of these beds I found a dense fragment of bone,\r\napparently reptilian, and a curious dermal plate punctulated with\r\nthick-set depressions, bounded on one side by a smooth band, and\r\naltogether closely resembling some saddler's thimble that had been cut\r\nopen and straightened.\r\n\r\nFollowing the beds downwards along the beach, I found that one of the\r\nlowest which the tide permitted me to examine,--a bed colored with a\r\ntinge of red,--was formed of a denser limestone than any of the others,\r\nand composed chiefly of vast numbers of small univalves resembling\r\nNeritae. It was in exactly such a rock I had found, in the previous year,\r\nthe reptile remains; and I now set myself, with no little eagerness, to\r\nexamine it. One of the first pieces I tore up contained a well-preserved\r\nPlesiosaurian vertebra; a second contained a vertebra and a rib; and,\r\nshortly after, I disinterred a large portion of a pelvis. I had at\r\nlength found, beyond doubt, the reptile remains _in situ_. The bed in\r\nwhich they occur is laid bare here for several hundred feet along the\r\nbeach, jutting out at a low angle among boulders and gravel, and the\r\nreptile remains we find embedded chiefly in its under side. It lies low\r\nin the Oolite. All the stratified rocks of the island, with the\r\nexception of a small Liasic patch, belong to the Lower Oolite, and the\r\nreptile-bed occurs deep in the base of the system,--low in its relation\r\nto the nether division, in which it is included. I found it nowhere\r\nrising to the level of high-water mark. It forms one of the foundation\r\ntiers of the island, which, as the latter rises over the sea in some\r\nplaces to the height of about fourteen hundred feet, its upper peaks and\r\nridges must overlie the bones, making allowance for the dip, to the\r\ndepth of at least sixteen hundred. Even at the close of the Oolitic\r\nperiod this sepulchral stratum must have been a profoundly ancient one.\r\nIn working it out, I found two fine specimens of fish jaws, still\r\nretaining their ranges of teeth;--ichthyodorulites,--occipital plates of\r\nvarious forms, either reptile or ichthyic,--Ganoid scales, of nearly the\r\nsame varieties of pattern as those in the Weald of Morayshire,--and the\r\nvertebrae and ribs, with the digital, pelvic, and limb-bones, of\r\nsaurians. It is not unworthy of remark, that in none of the beds of this\r\ndeposit did I find any of the more characteristic shells of the\r\nsystem,--Ammonites, Belemnites, Gryphites, or Nautili.\r\n\r\nI explored the shores of the island on to the _Ru Stoir_, and thence to\r\nthe Bay of Laig; but though I found detached masses of the reptile bed\r\noccurring in abundance, indicating that its place lay not far beyond the\r\nfall of ebb, in no other locality save the one described did I find it\r\nlaid bare. I spent some time beside the Bay of Laig in reexamining the\r\nmusical sand, in the hope of determining the peculiarities on which its\r\nsonorous qualities depended. But I examined, and cross-examined it in\r\nvain. I merely succeeded in ascertaining, in addition to my previous\r\nobservations, that the loudest sounds are elicited by drawing the hand\r\nslowly through the incoherent mass, in a segment of a circle, at the\r\nfull stretch of the arm, and that the vibrations which produce them\r\ncommunicate a peculiar titillating sensation to the hand or foot by\r\nwhich they are elicited, extending in the foot to the knee, and in the\r\nhand to the elbow. When we pass the wet finger along the edge of an\r\nale-glass partially filled with water, we see the vibrations thickly\r\nwrinkling the surface: the undulations which, communicated to the air,\r\nproduce sound, render themselves, when communicated to the water,\r\nvisible to the eye; and the titillating feeling seems but a modification\r\nof the same phenomenon acting on the nerves and fluids of the leg or\r\narm. It appears to be produced by the wrinklings of the vibrations, if I\r\nmay so speak, passing along sentient channels. The sounds will\r\nultimately be found dependent, I am of opinion, though I cannot yet\r\nexplain the principle, on the purely quartzose character of the sand,\r\nand the friction of the incoherent upper strata against under strata\r\ncoherent and damp. I remained ten days in the island, and went over all\r\nmy former ground, but succeeded in making no further discoveries.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Wednesday, June 25th, we set sail for Isle Ornsay,\r\nwith a smart breeze from the north-west. The lower and upper sky was\r\ntolerably clear, and the sun looked cheerily down on the deep blue of\r\nthe sea; but along the higher ridges of the land there lay long level\r\nstrata of what the meteorologists distinguish as parasitic clouds. When\r\nevery other patch of vapor in the landscape was in motion, scudding\r\nshorewards from the Atlantic before the still-increasing gale, there\r\nrested along both the Scuir of Eigg and the tall opposite ridge of the\r\nisland, and along the steep peaks of Rum, clouds that seemed as if\r\nanchored, each on its own mountain-summit, and over which the gale\r\nfailed to exert any propelling power. They were stationary in the middle\r\nof the rushing current, when all else was speeding before it. It has\r\nbeen shown that these parasitic clouds are mere local condensations of\r\nstrata of damp air passing along the mountain-summits, and rendered\r\nvisible but to the extent in which the summits affect the temperature.\r\nInstead of being stationary, they are ever-forming and ever-dissipating\r\nclouds,--clouds that form a few yards in advance of the condensing hill,\r\nand that dissipate a few yards after they have quitted it. I had nothing\r\nto do on deck, for we had been joined at Eigg by John Stewart; and so,\r\nafter watching the appearance of the stationary clouds for some little\r\ntime, I went below, and, throwing myself into the minister's large\r\nchair, took up a book. The gale meanwhile freshened, and freshened yet\r\nmore; and the Betsey leaned over till her lee chain-plate lay along in\r\nthe water. There was the usual combination of sounds beneath and around\r\nme,--the mixture of guggle, clunk, and splash,--of low, continuous rush,\r\nand bluff, loud blow, which forms in such circumstances the voyager's\r\nconcert. I soon became aware, however, of yet another species of sound,\r\nwhich I did not like half so well,--a sound as of the washing of a\r\nshallow current over a rough surface; and, on the minister coming below,\r\nI asked him, tolerably well prepared for his answer, what it might\r\nmean. \"It means,\" he said, \"that we have sprung a leak, and a rather bad\r\none; but we are only some six or eight miles from the Point of Sleat,\r\nand must soon catch the land.\" He returned on deck, and I resumed my\r\nbook. Presently, however, the rush became greatly louder; some other\r\nweak patch in the Betsey's upper works had given way, and anon the water\r\ncame washing up from the lee side along the edge of the cabin floor. I\r\ngot upon deck to see how matters stood with us; and the minister, easing\r\noff the vessel for a few points, gave instant orders to shorten sail, in\r\nthe hope of getting her upper works out of the water, and then to unship\r\nthe companion ladder, beneath which a hatch communicated with the low\r\nstrip of hold under the cabin, and to bring aft the pails. We lowered\r\nour foresail; furled up the mainsail half-mast high; John Stewart took\r\nhis station at the pump; old Alister and I, furnished with pails, took\r\nours, the one at the foot, the other at the head, of the companion, to\r\nhand up and throw over; a young girl, a passenger from Eigg to the\r\nmainland, lent her assistance, and got wofully drenched in the work;\r\nwhile the minister, retaining his station at the helm, steered right on.\r\nBut the gale had so increased, that, notwithstanding our diminished\r\nbreadth of sail, the Betsey, straining hard in the rough sea, still lay\r\nin to the gunwale; and the water, pouring in through a hundred opening\r\nchinks in her upper works, rose, despite of our exertions, high over\r\nplank, and beam, and cabin-floor, and went dashing against beds and\r\nlockers. She was evidently filling, and bade fair to terminate all her\r\nvoyagings by a short trip to the bottom. Old Alister, a seaman of thirty\r\nyears' standing, whose station at the bottom of the cabin stairs enabled\r\nhim to see how fast the water was gaining on the Betsey, but not how the\r\nBetsey was gaining on the land, was by no means the least anxious among\r\nus. Twenty years previous he had seen a vessel go down in exactly\r\nsimilar circumstances, and in nearly the same place, and the\r\nreminiscence, in the circumstances, seemed rather an uncomfortable one.\r\nIt had been a bad evening, he said, and the vessel he sailed in, and a\r\nsloop, her companion, were pressing hard to gain the land. The sloop had\r\nsprung a leak, and was straining, as if for life and death, under a\r\npress of canvas. He saw her outsail the vessel to which he belonged,\r\nbut, when a few shots a-head she gave a sudden lurch, and disappeared\r\nfrom the surface instantaneously as a vanishing spectre, and neither\r\nsloop nor crew were ever more heard of.\r\n\r\nThere are, I am convinced, few deaths less painful than some of those\r\nuntimely and violent ones at which we are most disposed to shudder. We\r\nwrought so hard at pail and pump,--the occasion, too, was one of so much\r\nexcitement, and tended so thoroughly to awaken our energies,--that I was\r\nconscious, during the whole time, of an exhilaration of spirits rather\r\npleasurable than otherwise. My fancy was active, and active, strange as\r\nthe fact may seem, chiefly with ludicrous objects. Sailors tell\r\nregarding the flying Dutchman, that he was a hard-headed captain of\r\nAmsterdam, who, in a bad night and head wind, when all the other vessels\r\nof his fleet were falling back on the port they had recently quitted,\r\nobstinately swore that, rather than follow their example, he would keep\r\nbeating about till the day of judgment. And the Dutch captain, says the\r\nstory, was just taken at his word, and is beating about still. When\r\nmatters were at the worst with us, we got under the lea of the point of\r\nSleat. The promontory interposed between us and the roll of the sea; the\r\nwind gradually took off; and, after having seen the water gaining fast\r\nand steadily on us for considerably more than an hour, we, in turn,\r\nbegan to gain on the water. It came ebbing out of drawers and beds, and\r\nsunk downwards along pannels and table-legs,--a second retiring deluge;\r\nand we entered Isle Ornsay with the cabin-floor all visible, and less\r\nthan two feet water in the hold. On the following morning, taking leave\r\nof my friend the minister, I set off, on my return homewards, by the\r\nSkye steamer, and reached Edinburgh on the evening of Saturday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n RAMBLES OF A GEOLOGIST;\r\n\r\n OR,\r\n\r\n TEN THOUSAND MILES OVER THE FOSSILIFEROUS\r\n DEPOSITS OF SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAMBLES OF A GEOLOGIST;\r\n\r\nOR,\r\n\r\nTEN THOUSAND MILES OVER THE FOSSILIFEROUS DEPOSITS OF SCOTLAND.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     Embarkation--A foundered Vessel--Lateness of the Harvest dependent\r\n     on the Geological character of the Soil--A Granite Harvest and an\r\n     Old Red Harvest--Cottages of Redstone and of Granite--Arable Soil\r\n     of Scotland the result of a Geological Grinding Agency--Locality of\r\n     the Famine of 1846--Mr. Longmuir's Fossils--Geology necessary to a\r\n     Theologian--Popularizers of Science when dangerous--\"Constitution\r\n     of Man,\" and \"Vestiges of Creation\"--Atop of the Banff Coach--A\r\n     Geologist's Field Equipment--The trespassing \"Stirk\"--Silurian\r\n     Schists inlaid with Old Red--Bay of Gamrie how\r\n     formed--Gardenstone--Geological Free-masonry illustrated--How to\r\n     break an Ichthyolite Nodule--An old Rhyme mended--A raised\r\n     Beach--Fossil Shells--Scotland under water at the time of the\r\n     Boulder Clays.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom circumstances that in no way call for explanation, my usual\r\nexploratory ramble was thrown this year (1847) from the middle of July\r\ninto the middle of September; and I embarked at Granton for the north\r\njust as the night began to count hour against hour with the day. The\r\nweather was fine, and the voyage pleasant. I saw by the way, however, at\r\nleast one melancholy memorial of a hurricane which had swept the eastern\r\ncoasts of the island about a fortnight before, and filled the provincial\r\nnewspapers with paragraphs of disaster. Nearly opposite where the Red\r\nHead lifts its mural front of Old Red Sandstone a hundred yards over the\r\nbeach, the steamer passed a foundered vessel, lying about a mile and a\r\nhalf off the land, with but her topmast and the point of her peak over\r\nthe surface. Her vane, still at the mast-head, was drooping in the calm;\r\nand its shadow, with that of the fresh-colored _spar_ to which it was\r\nattached, white atop and yellow beneath, formed a well-defined\r\nundulatory strip on the water, that seemed as if ever in the process of\r\nbeing rolled up, and yet still retained its length unshortened. Every\r\nrecession of the swell showed a patch of mainsail attached to the peak:\r\nthe sail had been hoisted to its full stretch when the vessel went down.\r\nAnd thus, though no one survived to tell the story of her disaster,\r\nenough remained to show that she had sprung a leak when straining in the\r\ngale, and that, when staggering under a press of canvas towards the\r\nstill distant shore, where, by stranding her, the crew had hoped to save\r\nat least their lives, she had disappeared with a sudden lurch, and all\r\naboard had perished. I remembered having read, among other memorabilia\r\nof the hurricane, without greatly thinking of the matter, that \"a large\r\nsloop had foundered off the Red Head,--name unknown.\" But the minute\r\nportion of the wreck which I saw rising over the surface, to certify,\r\nlike some frail memorial in a churchyard, that the dead lay beneath, had\r\nan eloquence in it which the words wanted, and at once sent the\r\nimagination back to deal with the stern realities of the disaster, and\r\nthe feelings abroad to expatiate over saddened hearths and melancholy\r\nhomesteads, where for many a long day the hapless perished would be\r\nmissed and mourned, but where the true story of their fate, though too\r\nsurely guessed at, would never be known.\r\n\r\nThe harvest had been early; and on to the village of Stonehaven, and a\r\nmile or two beyond, where the fossiliferous deposits end and the primary\r\nbegin, the country presented from the deck only a wide expanse of\r\nstubble. Every farm-steading we passed had its piled stack-yard; and the\r\nfields were bare. But the line of demarcation between the Old Red\r\nSandstone and the granitic districts formed also a separating line\r\nbetween an earlier and later harvest; the fields of the less kindly\r\nsubsoil derived from the primary rocks were, I could see, still speckled\r\nwith sheaves; and, where the land lay high, or the exposure was\r\nunfavorable, there were reapers at work. All along in the course of my\r\njourney northward from Aberdeen I continued to find the country covered\r\nwith shocks, and laborers employed among them; until, crossing the Spey,\r\nI entered on the fossiliferous districts of Moray; and then, as in the\r\nsouth, the champaign again showed a bare breadth of stubble, with here\r\nand there a ploughman engaged in turning it down. The traveller bids\r\nfarewell at Stonehaven to not only the Old Red Sandstone and the\r\nearly-harvest districts, but also to the rich wheat-lands of the\r\ncountry, and does not again fairly enter upon them until, after\r\ntravelling nearly a hundred miles, he passes from Banffshire into the\r\nprovince of Moray. He leaves behind him at the same line the\r\nwheat-fields and the cottages built of red stone, to find only barley\r\nand oats, and here and there a plot of rye, associated with cottages of\r\ngranite and gneiss, hyperstene and mica schist; but on crossing the\r\nSpey, the red cottages reappear, and fields of rich wheat-land spread\r\nout around them, as in the south. The circumstance is not unworthy the\r\nnotice of the geologist. It is but a tedious process through which the\r\nminute lichen, settling on a surface of naked stone, forms in the course\r\nof ages a soil for plants of greater bulk and a higher order; and had\r\nScotland been left to the exclusive operation of this slow agent, it\r\nwould be still a rocky desert, with perhaps here and there a strip of\r\nalluvial meadow by the side of a stream, and here and there an insulated\r\npatch of rich soil among the hollows of the crags. It might possess a\r\nfew gardens for the spade, but no fields for the plough. We owe our\r\narable land to that comparatively modern geologic agent, whatever its\r\ncharacter, that crushed, as in a mill, the upper parts of the\r\nsurface-rocks of the kingdom, and then overlaid them with their own\r\ndebris and rubbish to the depth of from one to forty yards. This debris,\r\nexisting in one locality as a boulder-clay more or less finely\r\ncomminuted, in another as a grossly pounded gravel, forms, with few\r\nexceptions, that subsoil of the country on which the existing vegetation\r\nfirst found root; and, being composed mainly of the formations on which\r\nit more immediately rests, it partakes of their character,--bearing a\r\ncomparatively lean and hungry aspect over the primary rocks, and a\r\ngreatly more fertile one over those deposits in which the organic\r\nmatters of earlier creations lie diffused. Saxon industry has done much\r\nfor the primary districts of Aberdeen and Banffshires, though it has\r\nfailed to neutralize altogether the effects of causes which date as\r\nearly as the times of the Old Red Sandstone; but in the Highlands, which\r\nbelong almost exclusively to the non-fossiliferous formations, and which\r\nwere, on at least the western coasts, but imperfectly subjected to that\r\ngrinding process to which we owe our subsoils, the poor Celt has\r\npermitted the consequences of the original difference to exhibit\r\nthemselves in full. If we except the islands of the Inner Hebrides, the\r\nfamine of 1846 was restricted in Scotland to the primary districts.\r\n\r\nI made it my first business, on landing in Aberdeen, to wait on my\r\nfriend Mr. Longmuir, that I might compare with him a few geological\r\nnotes, and benefit by his knowledge of the surrounding country. I was,\r\nhowever, unlucky enough to find that he had gone, a few days before, on\r\na journey, from which he had not yet returned; but, through the kindness\r\nof Mrs. Longmuir, to whom I took the liberty of introducing myself, I\r\nwas made free of his stone-room, and held half an hour's conversation\r\nwith his Scotch fossils of the Chalk. These had been found, as the\r\nreaders of the _Witness_ must remember from his interesting paper on the\r\nsubject, on the hill of Dudwick, in the neighborhood of Ellon, and were\r\nchiefly impressions--some of them of singular distinctness and\r\nbeauty--in yellow flint. I saw among them several specimens of the\r\nInoceramus, a thin-shelled, ponderously-hinged conchifer, characteristic\r\nof the Cretaceous group, but which has no living representative; with\r\nnumerous flints, traversed by rough-edged, bifurcated hollows, in which\r\nbranched sponges had once lain; a well-preserved Pecten; the impressions\r\nof spines of Echini of at least two distinct species; and the\r\nnicely-marked impression of part of a Cidaris, with the balls on which\r\nthe sockets of the club-like spines had been fitted existing in the\r\nprint as spherical moulds, in which shot might be cast, and with the\r\ncentral ligamentary depression, which in the actual fossil exists but as\r\na minute cavity, projecting into the centre of each hollow sphere, like\r\nthe wooden fusee into the centre of a bomb-shell. This latter cast, fine\r\nand sharp as that of a medal taken in sulphur, seems sufficient of\r\nitself to establish two distinct points: in the first place, that the\r\nsiliceous matter of which the flint is composed, though now so hard and\r\nrigid, must, in its original condition, have been as impressible as wax\r\nsoftened to receive the stamp of the seal; and, in the next, that though\r\nit was thus yielding in its character, it could not have greatly shrunk\r\nin the process of hardening. I looked with no little interest on these\r\nremains of a Scotch formation now so entirely broken up, that, like\r\nthose ruined cities of the East which exist but as mere lines of\r\nwrought material barring the face of the desert, there has not \"been\r\nleft one stone of it upon another,\" but of which the fragments, though\r\nwidely scattered, bear imprinted upon them, like the stamped bricks of\r\nBabylon, the story of its original condition, and a record of its\r\n_founders_. All Mr. Longmuir's Cretaceous fossils from the hill of\r\nDudwick are of flint,--a substance not easily ground down by the\r\ndenuding agencies.\r\n\r\nI found several other curious fossils in Mr. Longmuir's collection.\r\nGreatly more interesting, however, than any of the specimens which it\r\ncontains, is the general fact, that it should be the collection of a\r\nFree Church minister, sedulously attentive to the proper duties of his\r\noffice, but who has yet found time enough to render himself an\r\naccomplished geologist; and whose week-day lectures on the science\r\nattract crowds, who receive from them, in many instances, their first\r\nknowledge of the strange revolutions of which our globe has been the\r\nsubject, blent with the teachings of a wholesome theology. The present\r\nage, above all that has gone before, is peculiarly the age of physical\r\nscience; and of all the physical sciences, not excepting astronomy\r\nitself, geology, though it be a fact worthy of notice, that not one of\r\nour truly accomplished geologists is an infidel, is the science of which\r\ninfidelity has most largely availed itself. And as the theologian in a\r\nmetaphysical age,--when skepticism, conforming to the character of the\r\ntime, disseminated its doctrines in the form of nicely abstract\r\nspeculations,--had, in order that the enemy might be met in his own\r\nfield, to become a skilful metaphysician, he must now, in like manner,\r\naddress himself to the tangibilities of natural history and geology, if\r\nhe would avoid the danger and disgrace of having his flank turned by\r\nevery sciolist in these walks whom he may chance to encounter. It is\r\nthose identical bastions and outworks that are _now_ attacked, which\r\nmust be _now_ defended; not those which were attacked some eighty or a\r\nhundred years ago. And as he who succeeds in first mixing up fresh and\r\ncurious truths, either with the objections by which religion is assailed\r\nor the arguments by which it is defended, imparts to his cause all the\r\ninterest which naturally attaches to these truths, and leaves to his\r\nopponent, who passes over them after him as at second hand, a subject\r\ndivested of the fire-edge of novelty, I can deem Mr. Longmuir well and\r\nnot unprofessionally employed, in connecting with a sound creed the\r\npicturesque marvels of one of the most popular of the sciences, and by\r\nthis means introducing them to his people, linked, from the first, with\r\nright associations. According to the old fiction, the look of the\r\nbasilisk did not kill unless the creature saw before it was seen;--its\r\nmere _return_ glance was harmless; and there is a class of thoroughly\r\ndangerous writers who in this respect resemble the basilisk. It is\r\nperilous to give them a first look of the public. They are formidable\r\nsimply as the earliest popularizers of some interesting science, or the\r\nfirst promulgators of some class of curious little-known facts, with\r\nwhich they mix up their special contributions of error,--often the only\r\nportion of their writings that really belongs to themselves. Nor is it\r\nat all so easy to _counteract_ as to _confute_ them. A masterly\r\nconfutation of the part of their works truly their own may, from its\r\nsubject, be a very unreadable book: it can have but the insinuated\r\npoison to deal with, unmixed with the palatable pabulum in which the\r\npoison has been conveyed; and mere treatises on poisons, whether moral\r\nor medical, are rarely works of a very delectable order. It seems to be\r\non this principle that there exists no confutation of the \"Constitution\r\nof Man\" in which the ordinary reader finds amusement to carry him\r\nthrough; whereas the work itself, full of curious miscellaneous\r\ninformation, is eminently readable; and that the \"Vestiges of\r\nCreation,\"--a treatise as entertaining as the \"Arabian Nights,\"--bids\r\nfair, not from the amount of error which it contains, but from the\r\namount of fresh and interestingly told truth with which the error is\r\nmingled, to live and do mischief when the various solidly-scientific\r\nreplies which it has called forth are laid upon the shelf. Both the\r\n\"Constitution\" and the \"Vestiges\" had the advantage, so essential to the\r\nbasilisk, of taking the first glance of the public on their respective\r\nsubjects; whereas their confutators have been able to render them back\r\nbut mere _return_ glances. The only efficiently counteractive mode of\r\nlooking down the danger, in cases of this kind, is the mode adopted by\r\nMr. Longmuir.\r\n\r\nThere was a smart frost next morning; and, for a few hours, my seat on\r\nthe top of the Banff coach, by which I travelled across the country to\r\nwhere the Gamrie and Banff roads part company, was considerably more\r\ncool than agreeable. But the keen morning improved into a brilliant day,\r\nwith an atmosphere transparent as if there had been no atmosphere at\r\nall, through which the distant objects looked out as sharp of outline,\r\nand in as well-defined light and shadow, as if they had occupied the\r\nbackground, not of a Scotch, but of an Italian landscape. A few\r\nspeck-like sails, far away on the intensely blue sea, which opened upon\r\nus in a stretch of many leagues, as we surmounted the moory ridge over\r\nMacduff, gleamed to the sun with a radiance bright as that of the sparks\r\nof a furnace blown to a white heat. The land, uneven of surface, and\r\nopen, and abutting in bold promontories on the frith, still bore the\r\nsunny hue of harvest, and seemed as if stippled over with shocks from\r\nthe ridgy hill summits, to where ranges of giddy cliffs flung their\r\nshadows across the beach. I struck off for Gamrie by a path that runs\r\neastward, nearly parallel to the shore,--which at one or two points it\r\noverlooks from dark-colored cliffs of grauwacke slate,--to the fishing\r\nvillage of Gardenstone. My dress was the usual fatigue suit of russet,\r\nin which I find I can work amid the soil of ravines and quarries with\r\nnot only the best effect, but with even the least possible sacrifice of\r\nappearance: the shabbiest of all suits is a good suit spoiled. My\r\nhammer-shaft projected from my pocket; a knapsack, with a few changes of\r\nlinen, slung suspended from my shoulders; a strong cotton umbrella\r\noccupied my better hand; and a gray maud, buckled shepherd-fashion\r\naslant the chest, completed my equipment. There were few travellers on\r\nthe road, which forked off on the hill-side a short mile away, into two\r\nbranches, like a huge letter Y, leaving me uncertain which branch to\r\nchoose; and I made up my mind to have the point settled by a woman of\r\nmiddle age, marked by a hard, _manly_ countenance, who was coming up\r\ntowards me, bound apparently for the Banff or Macduff market, and\r\nstooping under a load of dairy produce. She too, apparently, had her\r\npurpose to serve or point to settle; for as we met, she was the first to\r\nstand; and, sharply scanning my appearance and aspect at a glance, she\r\nabruptly addressed me. \"Honest man,\" she said, \"do you see yon house wi'\r\nthe chimla?\" \"That house with the farm-steadings and stacks beside it?\"\r\nI replied. \"Yes.\" \"Then I'd be obleeged if ye wald just stap in as ye'r\r\ngaing east the gate, and tell _our_ folk that the stirk has gat fra her\r\ntether, an' 'ill brak on the wat clover. Tell them to sen' for her\r\n_that_ minute.\" I undertook the commission; and, passing the endangered\r\nstirk, that seemed luxuriating, undisturbed by any presentiment of\r\nimpending peril, amid the rich swathe of a late clover crop, still damp\r\nwith the dews of the morning frost, I tapped at the door of the\r\nfarm-house, and delivered my message to a young good-looking girl, in\r\nnearly the words of the woman:--\"The gude-wife bade me tell _them_,\" I\r\nsaid, \"to send that instant for the stirk, for she had gat fra her\r\ntether, and would brak on the wat clover.\" The girl blushed just a very\r\nlittle, and thanked me; and then, after obliging me, in turn, by laying\r\ndown for me my proper route,--for I had left the question of the forked\r\nroad to be determined at the farm-house,--she set off at high speed, to\r\nrescue the unconscious stirk. A walk of rather less than two hours\r\nbrought me abreast of the Bay of Gamrie,--a picturesque indentation of\r\nthe coast, in the formation of which the agency of the old denuding\r\nforces, operating on deposits of unequal solidity, may be distinctly\r\ntraced. The surrounding country is composed chiefly of Silurian schists,\r\nin which there is deeply inlaid a detached strip of mouldering Old Red\r\nSandstone, considerably more than twenty miles in length, and that\r\nvaries from two to three miles in breadth. It seems to have been let\r\ndown into the more ancient formation,--like the keystone of a bridge\r\ninto the ringstones of the arch when the work is in the act of being\r\ncompleted,--during some of those terrible convulsions which cracked and\r\nrent the earth's crust, as if it had been an earthen pipkin brought to a\r\nred heat and then plunged into cold water. Its consequent occurrence in\r\na lower tier of the geological edifice than that to which it originally\r\nbelonged has saved it from the great denudation which has swept from the\r\nsurface of the surrounding country the tier composed of its contemporary\r\nbeds and strata, and laid bare the grauwacke on which this upper tier\r\nrested. But where it presents its narrow end to the sea, as the older\r\nhouses in our more ancient Scottish villages present their gables to the\r\nstreet, the waves of the German Ocean, by incessantly charging against\r\nit, propelled by the tempests of the stormy north, have hollowed it\r\ninto the Bay of Gamrie, and left the more solid grauwacke standing out\r\nin bold promontories on either side, as the headlands of Gamrie and\r\nTroup.\r\n\r\nIn passing downwards on the fishing village of Gardenstone, mainly in\r\nthe hope of procuring a guide to the ichthyolite beds, I saw a laborer\r\nat work with a pickaxe, in a little craggy ravine, about a hundred yards\r\nto the left of the path, and two gentlemen standing beside him. I paused\r\nfor a moment, to ascertain whether the latter were not brother-workers\r\nin the geologic field. \"Hilloa!--here,\"--shouted out the stouter of the\r\ntwo gentlemen, as if, by some _clairvoyant_ faculty, he had dived into\r\nmy secret thought; \"come here.\" I went down into the ravine, and found\r\nthe laborer engaged in disinterring ichthyolitic nodules out of a bed of\r\ngray stratified clay, identical in its composition with that of the\r\nCromarty fish-beds; and a heap of freshly-broken nodules, speckled with\r\nthe organic remains of the Lower Old Red Sandstone,--chiefly occipital\r\nplates and scales,--lay beside him. \"Know you aught of these?\" said the\r\nstouter gentleman, pointing to the heap. \"A little,\" I replied; \"but\r\nyour specimens are none of the finest. Here, however, is a dorsal plate\r\nof Coccosteus; and here a scattered group of scales of Osteolepis; and\r\nhere the occipital plates of _Cheirolepis Cummingiae_; and here the spine\r\nof the anterior dorsal of _Diplacanthus striatus_.\" My reading of the\r\nfossils was at once recognized, like the mystic sign of the freemason,\r\nas establishing for me a place among the geologic brotherhood; and the\r\nstout gentleman producing a spirit-flask and a glass, I pledged him and\r\nhis companion in a bumper. \"Was I not sure?\" he said, addressing his\r\nfriend: \"I knew by the cut of his jib, notwithstanding his shepherd's\r\nplaid, that he was a wanderer of the scientific cast.\" We discussed the\r\npeculiarities of the deposit, which, in its mineralogical character, and\r\ngenerically in that of its organic contents, resembles, I found, the\r\nfish-beds of Cromarty (though, curiously enough, the intervening\r\ncontemporary deposits of Moray and the western parts of Banffshire\r\ndiffer widely, in at least their chemistry, from both); and we were\r\nright good friends ere we parted. To men who travel for amusement,\r\nincident is incident, however trivial in itself, and always worth\r\nsomething. I showed the younger of the two geologists my mode of\r\nbreaking open an ichthyolitic nodule, so as to secure the best possible\r\nsection of the fish. \"Ah,\" he said, as he marked a style of handling the\r\nhammer which, save for the fifteen years' previous practice of the\r\noperative mason, would be perhaps less complete,--\"Ah, you must have\r\nbroken open a great many.\" His own knowledge of the formation and its\r\nichthyolites had been chiefly derived, he added, from a certain little\r\ntreatise on the \"Old Red Sandstone,\" rather popular than scientific,\r\nwhich he named. I of course claimed no acquaintance with the work; and\r\nthe conversation went on.\r\n\r\nThe ill luck of my new friends, who had been toiling among the nodules\r\nfor hours without finding an ichthyolite worth transferring to their\r\nbag, showed me that, without excavating more deeply than my time\r\nallowed, I had no chance of finding good specimens. But, well content to\r\nhave ascertained that the ichthyolite bed of Gamrie is identical in its\r\ncomposition, and, generically at least, in its organisms, with the beds\r\nwith which I was best acquainted, I rose to come away. The object which\r\nI next proposed to myself was, to determine whether, as at Eathie and\r\nCromarty, the fossils here appear not only on the hill-side, but also\r\ncrop out along the shore. On taking leave, however, of the geologists, I\r\nwas reminded by the younger of what I might have otherwise\r\nforgotten,--a raised beach in the immediate neighborhood (first\r\ndescribed by Mr. Prestwich, in his paper on the Gamrie ichthyolites),\r\nwhich contains shells of the existing species at a higher level than\r\nelsewhere,--so far as is yet known,--on the east coast of Scotland. And,\r\nkindly conducting me till he had brought me full within view of it, we\r\nparted. The ichthyolites which I had just been laying open occur on the\r\nverge of that Strathbogie district in which the Church controversy raged\r\nso hot and high; and by a common enough trick of the associative\r\nfaculty, they now recalled to my mind a stanza which memory had somehow\r\ncaught when the battle was at the fiercest. It formed part of a satiric\r\naddress, published in an Aberdeen newspaper, to the not very respectable\r\nnon-intrusionists who had smoked tobacco and drank whisky in the parish\r\nchurch at Culsalmond, on the day of a certain forced settlement there,\r\nspecially recorded by the clerks of the Justiciary Court.\r\n\r\n \"Tobacco and whisky cost siller,\r\n   And meal is but scanty at hame;\r\n But gang to the stane-mason M----r,\r\n   Wi' Old Red Sandstone fish he'll fill your wame.\"\r\n\r\nRather a dislocated line that last, I thought, and too much in the style\r\nin which Zachary Boyd sings \"Pharaoh and the Pascal.\" And as it is wrong\r\nto leave the beast of even an enemy in the ditch, however long its ears,\r\nI must just try and set it on its legs. Would it not run better thus?\r\n\r\n \"Tobacco and whisky cost siller,\r\n   An' meal is but scanty at hame;\r\n But gang to the stane-mason M----r,\"\r\n   He'll pang wi' ichth'olites your wame,--\r\n Wi' _fish_!! as Agassiz has ca'ed 'em,\r\n   In Greek, like themsel's, _hard_ an' _odd_,\r\n That were baked in stane pies afore Adam\r\n   Gaed names to the haddocks and cod.\r\n\r\nBad enough as rhyme, I suspect; but conclusive as evidence to prove\r\nthat the animal spirits, under the influence of the bracing walk, the\r\nfine day, and the agreeable recounter at the fish-beds,--not forgetting\r\nthe half-gill bumper,--had mounted very considerably above their\r\nordinary level at the editorial desk.\r\n\r\nThe raised beach may be found on the slopes of a grass-covered eminence,\r\nonce the site of an ancient hill-fort, and which still exhibits, along\r\nthe rim-like edge of the flat area atop, scattered fragments of the\r\nvitrified walls. A general covering of turf restricted my examination of\r\nthe shells to one point, where a land-slip on a small scale had laid the\r\ndeposit bare; but I at least saw enough to convince me that the debris\r\nof the shell-fish used of old as food by the garrison had not been\r\nmistaken for the remains of a raised beach,--a mistake which in other\r\nlocalities has occurred, I have reason to believe, oftener than once.\r\nThe shells, some of them exceedingly minute, and not of edible species,\r\noccur in layers in a siliceous stratified sand, overlaid by a bed of\r\nbluish-colored silt. I picked out of the sand two entire specimens of a\r\nfull-grown Fusus, little more than half an inch in length,--the _Fusus\r\nturricola_; and the greater number of the fragments that lay bleaching\r\nat the foot of the broken slope, in a state of chalky friability, seemed\r\nto be fragments of those smaller bivalves, belonging to the genera\r\n_Donax_, _Venus_, and _Mactra_, that are so common on flat sandy shores.\r\nBut when the sea washed over these shells, they could have been the\r\ndenizens of at least no _flat_ shore. The descent on which they occur\r\nsinks downwards to the existing beach, over which it is elevated at this\r\npoint two hundred and thirty feet, at an angle with the horizon of from\r\nthirty-five to forty degrees. Were the land to be now submerged to where\r\nthey appear on the hill-side, the bay of Gamrie, as abrupt in its\r\nslopes as the upper part of Loch Lomond or the sides of Loch Ness,\r\nwould possess a depth of forty fathoms water at little more than a\r\nhundred yards from the shore. I may add, that I could trace at this\r\nheight no marks of such a continuous terrace around the sides of the bay\r\nas the waves would have infallibly excavated in the diluvium, had the\r\nsea stood at a level so high, or, according to the more prevalent view,\r\nhad the land stood at a level so low, for any considerable time; though\r\nthe green banks which sweep around the upper part of the inflection,\r\nunscarred by the defacing plough, would scarce have failed to retain\r\nsome mark of where the surges had broken, had the surges been long\r\nthere. Whatever may in this special case be the fact, however, I cannot\r\ndoubt that in the comparatively modern period of the boulder clays,\r\nScotland lay buried under water to a depth at least five times as great\r\nas the space between this ancient sea-beach and the existing tide-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     Character of the Rocks near Gardenstone--A Defunct Father-lasher--A\r\n     Geological Inference--Village of Gardenstone--The drunken\r\n     Scot--Gardenstone Inn--Lord Gardenstone--A Tempest threatened--The\r\n     Author's Ghost Story--The Lady in Green--Her Appearance and\r\n     Tricks--The Rescued Children--The murdered Peddler and his\r\n     Pack--Where the Green Dress came from--Village of Macduff--Peculiar\r\n     Appearance of the Beach at the Mouth of the Deveron--Dr. Emslie's\r\n     Fossils--_Pterichthys quadratus_--Argillaceous Deposit of\r\n     Blackpots--Pipe-laying in Scotland--Fossils of Blackpots Clay--Mr.\r\n     Longmuir's Description of them--Blackpots Deposit a Re-formation of\r\n     a Liasic Patch--Period of its Formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI lingered on the hill-side considerably longer than I ought; and then,\r\nhurrying downwards to the beach, passed eastwards under a range of\r\nabrupt, mouldering precipices of red sandstone, to the village. From the\r\nlie of the strata, which, instead of inclining coastwise, dip towards\r\nthe interior of the country, and present in the descent seawards the\r\noutcrop of lower and yet lower deposits of the formation, I found it\r\nwould be in vain to look for the ichthyolite beds along the shore. They\r\nmay possibly be found, however, though I lacked time to ascertain the\r\nfact, along the sides of a deep ravine, which occurs near an old\r\necclesiastical edifice of gray stone, perched, nest-like, half-way up\r\nthe bank, on a green hummock that overlooks the sea. The rocks, laid\r\nbare by the tide, belong to the bed of coarse-grained red sandstone,\r\nvarying from eighty to a hundred and fifty feet in thickness, which lies\r\nbetween the lower fish-bed and the great conglomerate, and which, in not\r\na few of its strata, passes itself into a species of conglomerate,\r\ndifferent only from that which it overlies, in being more finely\r\ncomminuted. The continuity of this bed, like that of the deposit on\r\nwhich it rests, is very remarkable. I have found it occurring at many\r\nvarious points, over an area at least ten thousand square miles in\r\nextent, and bearing always the same well-marked character of a more\r\nthoroughly ground-down conglomerate than the great conglomerate on which\r\nit reposes. The underlying bed is composed of broken fragments of the\r\nrocks below, crushed, as if by some imperfect rudimentary process, like\r\nthat which in a mill merely breaks the grain; whereas, in the bed above,\r\na portion of the previously-crushed materials seems to have been\r\nsubjected to some further attritive process, like that through which, in\r\nthe mill, the broken grain is ground down into meal or flour.\r\n\r\nAs I passed onwards, I saw, amid a heap of drift-weed stranded high on\r\nthe beach by the previous tide, a defunct father-lasher, with the two\r\ndefensive spines which project from its opercles stuck fast into little\r\ncubes of cork, that had floated its head above water, as the\r\ntyro-swimmer floats himself upon bladders; and my previous acquaintance\r\nwith the habits of a fishing village enabled me at once to determine why\r\nand how it had perished. Though almost never used as food on the eastern\r\ncoast of Scotland, it had been inconsiderate enough to take the\r\nfisherman's bait, as if it had been worthy of being eaten; and he had\r\navenged himself for the trouble it had cost him, by mounting it on cork,\r\nand sending it off, to wander between wind and water, like the Flying\r\nDutchman, until it died. Was there ever on earth a creature save man\r\nthat could have played a fellow-mortal a trick at once so ingeniously\r\nand gratuitously cruel? Or what would be the proper inference, were I to\r\nfind one of the many-thorned ichthyolites of the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nwith the spines of its pectorals similarly fixed on cubes of\r\nlignite?--that there had existed in these early ages not merely\r\n_physical death_, but also _moral evil_; and that the being who\r\nperpetrated the evil could not only inflict it simply for the sake of\r\nthe pleasure he found in it, and without prospect of advantage to\r\nhimself, but also by so adroitly reversing, fiend-like, the purposes of\r\nthe benevolent Designer, that the weapons given for the defence of a\r\npoor harmless creature should be converted into the instruments of its\r\ndestruction. It was not without meaning that it was forbidden by the law\r\nof Moses to seethe a kid in its mother's milk.\r\n\r\nA steep bulwark in front, against which the tide lashes twice every\r\ntwenty-four hours,--an abrupt hill behind,--a few rows of squalid\r\ncottages built of red sandstone, much wasted by the keen sea-winds,--a\r\nwilderness of dunghills and ruinous pig-styes,--women seated at the\r\ndoors, employed in baiting lines or mending nets,--groups of men\r\nlounging lazily at some gable-end fronting the sea,--herds of ragged\r\nchildren playing in the lanes,--such are the components of the fishing\r\nvillage of Gardenstone. From the identity of name, I had associated the\r\nplace with that Lord Gardenstone of the Court of Sessions who published,\r\nlate in the last century, a volume of \"Miscellanies in Prose and Verse,\"\r\ncontaining, among other clever things, a series of tart criticisms on\r\nEnglish plays, transcribed, it was stated in the preface, from the\r\nmargins and fly-leaves of the books of a \"small library kept open by his\r\nLordship\" for the amusement of travellers at the inn of some village in\r\nhis immediate neighborhood; and taking it for granted, somehow, that\r\nGardenstone was the village, I was looking around me for the inn, in the\r\nhope that where his Lordship had opened a library I might find a dinner.\r\nBut failing to discern it, I addressed myself on the subject to an\r\nelderly man in a pack-sheet apron, who stood all alone, looking out upon\r\nthe sea, like Napoleon, in the print, from a projection of the bulwark.\r\nHe turned round, and showed, by an unmistakable expression of eye and\r\nfeature, that he was what the servant girl in \"Guy Mannering\"\r\ncharacterizes as \"very particularly drunk,\"--not stupidly, but happily,\r\nfunnily, conceitedly drunk, and full of all manner of high thoughts of\r\nhimself. \"It'll be an awfu' coorse nicht,\" he said, \"fra the sea.\" \"Very\r\nlikely,\" I replied, reiterating my query in a form that indicated some\r\nlittle confidence of receiving the needed information; \"I daresay you\r\ncould point me out the public-house here?\" \"Aweel, I wat, that I can;\r\nbut what's that?\" pointing to the straps of my knapsack;--\"are ye a\r\nsodger on the Queen's account, or ye'r ain?\" \"On my own, to be sure; but\r\nhave ye a public-house here?\" \"Ay, twa; ye'll be a traveller?\" \"O yes,\r\ngreat traveller, and very hungry: have I passed the best public-house?\"\r\n\"Ay; and ye'll hae come a gude stap the day?\" A woman came up, with\r\nspectacles on nose, and a piece of white seam-work in her hand; and,\r\ncutting short the dialogue by addressing myself to her, she at once\r\ndirected me to the public-house. \"Hoot, gude-wife,\" I heard the man say,\r\nas I turned down the street, \"we suld ha'e gotten mair oot o' him. He's\r\na great traveller yon, an' has a gude Scots tongue in his head.\"\r\n\r\nTravellers, save when, during the herring season, an occasional\r\nfish-curer comes the way, rarely bait at the Gardenstone inn; and in the\r\nlittle low-browed room, with its windows in the thatch, into which, as\r\nher best, the land-lady ushered me, I certainly found nothing to\r\nidentify the _locale_ with that chosen by the literary lawyer for his\r\nopen library. But, according to Ferguson, though \"learning was scant,\r\nprovision was good;\" and I dined sumptuously on an immense platter of\r\nfried flounders. There was a little bit of cold pork added to the fare;\r\nbut, aware from previous experience of the pisciverous habits of the\r\nswine of a fishing village, I did what I knew the defunct pig must have\r\nvery frequently done before me,--satisfied a keenly-whetted appetite on\r\nfish exclusively. I need hardly remind the reader that Lord\r\nGardenstone's inn was not that of Gardenstone, but that of\r\nLaurence-kirk,--the thriving village which it was the special ambition\r\nof this law-lord of the last century to create; and which, did it\r\nproduce only its famed snuff-boxes, with the invisible hinges, would be\r\nrather a more valuable boon to the country than that secured to it by\r\nthose law-lords of our own days, who at one fell blow disestablished the\r\nnational religion of Scotland, and broke off the only handle by which\r\ntheir friends the politicians could hope to _manage_ the country's old\r\nvigorous Presbyterianism. Meanwhile it was becoming apparent that the\r\nman with the apron had as shrewdly anticipated the character of the\r\ncoming night as if he had been soberer. The sun, ere its setting,\r\ndisappeared in a thick leaden haze, which enveloped the whole heavens;\r\nand twilight seemed posting on to night a full hour before its time. I\r\nsettled a very moderate bill, and set off under the cliffs at a round\r\npace, in the hope of scaling the hill, and gaining the high road atop\r\nwhich leads to Macduff, ere the darkness closed. I had, however,\r\nmiscalculated my distance; I, besides, lost some little time in the\r\nopening of the deep ravine to which I have already referred as that in\r\nwhich possibly the fish-beds may be found cropping out; and I had got\r\nbut a little beyond the gray ecclesiastical ruin, with its lonely\r\nburying-ground, when the tempest broke and the night fell.\r\n\r\nOne of the last objects which I saw, as I turned to take a farewell look\r\nof the bay of Gamrie, was the magnificent promontory of Troup Head,\r\noutlined in black on a ground of deep gray, with its two terminal stacks\r\nstanding apart in the sea. And straightway, through one of those tricks\r\nof association so powerful in raising, as if from the dead, buried\r\nmemories of things of which the mind has been oblivious for years, there\r\nstarted up in recollection the details of an ancient ghost-story, of\r\nwhich I had not thought before for perhaps a quarter of a century. It\r\nhad been touched, I suppose, in its obscure, unnoted corner, as Ithuriel\r\ntouched the toad, by the apparition of the insulated stacks of Troup,\r\nseen dimly in the thickening twilight over the solitary burying-ground.\r\nFor it so chances that one of the main incidents of the story bears\r\nreference to an insulated sea-stack; and it is connected altogether,\r\nthough I cannot fix its special locality, with this part of the coast.\r\nThe story had been long in my mother's family, into which it had been\r\noriginally brought by a great-grandfather of the writer, who quitted\r\nsome of the seaport villages of Banffshire for the northern side of the\r\nMoray Frith, about the year 1718; and, when pushing on in the darkness,\r\nstraining as I best could, to maintain a sorely-tried umbrella against\r\nthe capricious struggles of the tempest, that now tatooed furiously upon\r\nits back as if it were a kettle-drum, and now got underneath its stout\r\nribs, and threatened to send it up aloft like a balloon, and anon\r\ntwisted it from side to side, and strove to turn it inside out, like a\r\nKilmarnock night-cap,--I employed myself in arranging in my mind the\r\ndetails of the narrative, as they had been communicated to me half an\r\nage before by a female relative.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the story, though it existed long ere the times of Sir\r\nWalter Scott or the Waverly novels, bears some resemblance to the\r\nopening in the \"Monastery,\" of the story of the White Lady of Avenel.\r\nThe wife of a Banffshire proprietor of the minor class had been about\r\nsix months dead, when one of her husband's ploughmen, returning on\r\nhorseback from the smithy, in the twilight of an autumn evening, was\r\naccosted, on the banks of a small stream, by a stranger lady, tall and\r\nslim, and wholly attired in green, with her face wrapped up in the hood\r\nof her mantle, who requested to be taken up behind him on the horse, and\r\ncarried across. There was something in the tones of her voice that\r\nseemed to thrill through his very bones, and to insinuate itself, in the\r\nform of a chill fluid, between his skull and the scalp. The request,\r\ntoo, appeared a strange one; for the rivulet was small and low, and\r\ncould present no serious bar to the progress of the most timid\r\ntraveller. But the man, unwilling ungallantly to offend a lady, turned\r\nhis horse to the bank, and she sprang up lightly behind him. She was,\r\nhowever, a personage that could be better seen than felt; she came in\r\ncontact with the ploughman's back, he said, as if she had been an\r\nill-filled sack of wool; and when, on reaching the opposite side of the\r\nstreamlet, she leaped down as slightly as she had mounted, and he turned\r\nfearfully round to catch a second glimpse of her, it was in the\r\nconviction that she was a creature considerably less earthly in her\r\ntexture than himself. She had opened, with two pale, thin arms, the\r\nenveloping hood, exhibiting a face equally pale and thin, which seemed\r\nmarked, however, by the roguish, half-humorous expression of one who had\r\njust succeeded in playing off a good joke. \"My dead mistress!!\"\r\nexclaimed the ploughman. \"Yes, John, _your mistress_,\" replied the\r\nghost. \"But ride home, my bonny man, for it's growing late: you and I\r\nwill be better acquainted ere long.\" John accordingly rode home and told\r\nhis story.\r\n\r\nNext evening, about the same hour, as two of the laird's servant-maids\r\nwere engaged in washing in an out-house, there came a slight tap to the\r\ndoor. \"Come in,\" said one of the maids; and the lady entered, dressed,\r\nas on the previous night, in green. She swept past them to the inner\r\npart of the washing-room; and, seating herself on a low bench, from\r\nwhich, ere her death, she used occasionally to superintend their\r\nemployment, she began to question them, as if still in the body, about\r\nthe progress of their work. The girls, however, were greatly too\r\nfrightened to make any reply. She then visited an old woman who had\r\nnursed the laird, and to whom she used to show, ere her departure,\r\ngreatly more kindness than her husband. And she now seemed as much\r\ninterested in her welfare as ever. She inquired whether the laird was\r\nkind to her, and looking round her little smoky cottage, regretted she\r\nshould be so indifferently lodged, and that her cupboard, which was\r\nrather of the emptiest at the time, should not be more amply furnished.\r\nFor nearly a twelvemonth after, scarce a day passed in which she was not\r\nseen by some of the domestics; never, however, except on one occasion,\r\nafter the sun had risen, or before it had set. The maids could see her,\r\nin the gray of the morning flitting like a shadow round their beds, or\r\npeering in upon them at night through the dark window-panes, or at\r\nhalf-open doors. In the evening she would glide into the kitchen or some\r\nof the out-houses,--one of the most familiar and least dignified of her\r\nclass that ever held intercourse with mankind,--and inquire of the girls\r\nhow they had been employed during the day; often, however, without\r\nobtaining an answer, though from a cause different from that which had\r\nat first tied their tongues. For they had become so regardless of her\r\npresence, viewing her simply as a troublesome mistress, who had no\r\nlonger any claim to be heeded, that when she entered, and they had\r\ndropped their conversation, under the impression that their visitor was\r\na creature of flesh and blood like themselves, they would again resume\r\nit, remarking that the entrant was \"only the green lady.\" Though always\r\ncadaverously pale, and miserable looking, she affected a joyous\r\ndisposition, and was frequently heard to laugh, even when invisible. At\r\none time, when provoked by the studied silence of a servant girl, she\r\nflung a pillow at her head, which the girl caught up and returned; at\r\nanother, she presented her first acquaintance, the ploughman, with what\r\nseemed to be a handful of silver coin, which he transferred to his\r\npocket, but which, on hearing her laugh, he drew out, and found to be\r\nmerely a handful of slate shivers. On yet another occasion, the man,\r\nwhen passing on horseback through a clump of wood, was repeatedly struck\r\nfrom behind the trees by little pellets of turf; and, on riding into the\r\nthicket, he found that his assailant was the green lady. To her husband\r\nshe never appeared; but he frequently heard the tones of her voice\r\nechoing from the lower apartments, and the faint peal of her cold,\r\nunnatural laugh.\r\n\r\nOne day at noon, a year after her first appearance, the old nurse was\r\nsurprised to see her enter the cottage; as all her previous visits had\r\nbeen made early in the morning or late in the evening; whereas\r\nnow,--though the day was dark and lowering, and a storm of wind and rain\r\nhad just broken out,--still it _was_ day. \"Mammie,\" she said, \"I cannot\r\nopen the heart of the laird, and I have nothing of my own to give you;\r\nbut I think I can do something for you now. Go straight to the White\r\nHouse [that of a neighboring proprietor], and tell the folk there to set\r\nout with all the speed of man and horse for the black rock in the sea,\r\nat the foot of the crags, or they'll rue it dearly to their dying day.\r\nTheir bairns, foolish things, have gone out to the rock, and the tide\r\nhas flowed around them; and, if no help reach them soon, they'll be all\r\nscattered like sea-ware on the shore ere the fall of the sea. But if you\r\ngo and tell your story at the White House, mammie, the bairns will be\r\nsafe for an hour to come, and there will be something done by their\r\nmother to better you, for the news.\" The woman went, as directed, and\r\ntold her story; and the father of the children set out on horseback in\r\nhot haste for the rock,--a low, insulated skerry, which, lying on a\r\nsolitary part of the beach, far below the line of flood, was shut out\r\nfrom the view of the inhabited country by a wall of precipices, and\r\ncovered every tide by several feet of water. On reaching the edge of the\r\ncliffs, he saw the black rock, as the woman had described, surrounded by\r\nthe sea, and the children clinging to its higher crags. But, though the\r\nwaves were fast rising, his attempts to ride out through the surf to the\r\npoor little things were frustrated by their cries, which so frightened\r\nhis horse as to render it unmanageable; and so he had to gallop on to\r\nthe nearest fishing village for a boat. So much time was unavoidably\r\nlost in consequence, that nearly the whole beach was covered by the sea,\r\nand the surf had begun to lash the feet of the precipices behind; but\r\nuntil the boat arrived, not a single wave dashed over the black rock;\r\nthough immediately after the last of the children had been rescued, an\r\nimmense wreath of foam rose twice a man's height over its topmost\r\npinnacle.\r\n\r\nThe old nurse, on her return to the cottage, found the green lady\r\nsitting beside the fire. \"Mammie,\" she said, \"you have made friends to\r\nyourself to-day, who will be kinder to you than your foster-son. I must\r\nnow leave you. My time is out, and you'll be all left to yourselves; but\r\nI'll have no rest, mammie, for many a twelvemonth to come. Ten years\r\nago, a travelling peddler broke into our garden in the fruit season, and\r\nI sent out our old ploughman, who is now in Ireland, to drive him away.\r\nIt was on a Sunday, and everybody else was in church. The men struggled\r\nand fought, and the peddler was killed. But though I at first thought of\r\nbringing the case before the laird, when I saw the dead man's pack, with\r\nits silks and its velvets, and this unhappy piece of green satin\r\n(shaking her dress), my foolish heart beguiled me, and I made the\r\nploughman bury the peddler's body under our ash tree, in the corner of\r\nour garden, and we divided his goods and money between us. You must bid\r\nthe laird raise his bones, and carry them to the churchyard; and the\r\ngold, which you will find in the little bowl under the tapestry in my\r\nroom, must be sent to a poor old widow, the peddler's mother, who lives\r\non the shore of Leith. I must now away to Ireland to the ploughman; and\r\nI'll be e'en less welcome to him, mammie, than at the laird's; but the\r\nhungry blood cries loud against us both,--him and me,--and we must\r\nsuffer together. Take care you look not after me till I have passed the\r\nknowe.\" She glided away, as she spoke, in a gleam of light; and when the\r\nold woman had withdrawn her hand from her eyes, dazzled by the sudden\r\nbrightness, she saw only a large black gray-hound crossing the moor. And\r\nthe green lady was never afterwards seen in Scotland. The little hoard\r\nof gold pieces, however, stored in a concealed recess of her former\r\napartment, and the mouldering ruins of the peddler under the ash tree,\r\ngave evidence to the truth of her narrative. The story was hardly wild\r\nenough for a night so drear and a road so lonely; its ghost-heroine was\r\nbut a homely ghost-heroine, too little aware that the same familiarity\r\nwhich, according to the proverb, breeds contempt when exercised by the\r\ndenizens of this world, produces similar effects when too much indulged\r\nin by the inhabitants of another. But the arrangement and restoration of\r\nthe details of the tradition,--for they had been scattered in my mind\r\nlike the fragments of a broken fossil,--furnished me with so much\r\namusement, when struggling with the storm, as to shorten by at least\r\none-half the seven miles which intervene between Gamrie and Macduff.\r\nInstead, however, of pressing on to Banff, as I had at first intended,\r\nI baited for the night at a snug little inn in the latter village, which\r\nI reached just wet enough to enjoy the luxury of a strong clear fire of\r\nNewcastle coal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Longmuir had furnished me with a note of introduction to Dr. Emslie\r\nof Banff, an intelligent geologist, familiar with the deposits of the\r\ndistrict; and, walking on to his place of residence next morning, in a\r\nrain as heavy as that of the previous night, I made it my first business\r\nto wait on him, and deliver the note. Ere, however, crossing the\r\nDeveron, which flows between Banff and Macduff, I paused for a few\r\nminutes in the rain, to mark the peculiar appearance presented by the\r\nbeach where the river disembogues into the frith. Occurring as a\r\nrectangular spit in the line of the shore, with the expanded stream\r\nwidening into an estuary on its upper side, and the open sea on the\r\nlower, it marks the scene of an obstinate contest between antagonist\r\nforces,--the powerful sweep of the torrent, and the not less powerful\r\nwaves of the stormy north-east; and exists, in consequence, as a long\r\ngravelly prism, which presents as steep an angle of descent to the waves\r\non the one side as to the current on the other. It is a true river bar,\r\nbeaten in from its proper place in the sea by the violence of the surf,\r\nand fairly stranded. Dr. Emslie obligingly submitted to my inspection\r\nhis set of Gamrie fossils, containing several good specimens of\r\nPterichthys and Coccosteus, undistinguishable, like those I had seen on\r\nthe previous day, in their state of keeping, and the character of the\r\nnodular matrices in which they lie, from my old acquaintance the\r\nCephalaspians of Cromarty. The animal matter which the bony plates and\r\nscales originally contained has been converted, in both the Gamrie and\r\nCromarty ichthyolites, into a jet-black bitumen; and in both, the\r\ninclosing nodules consist of a smoke-colored argillaceous limestone,\r\nwhich formed around the organisms in a bed of stratified clay, and at\r\nonce exhibits, in consequence, the rectilinear lines of the\r\nstratification, mechanical in their origin, and the radiating ones of\r\nthe sub-crystalline concretion, purely a trick of the chemistry of the\r\ndeposit. A Pterichthys in Dr. Emslie's collection struck me as different\r\nin its proportions from any I had previously seen, though, from its\r\nstate of rather imperfect preservation, I hesitated to pronounce\r\nabsolutely upon the fact. I cannot now doubt, however, that it belonged\r\nto a species not figured nor described at the time; but which, under the\r\nname of _Pterichthys quadratus_, forms in part the subject of a still\r\nunpublished memoir, in which Sir Philip Egerton, our first British\r\nauthority on fossil fish, has done me the honor to associate my humble\r\nname with his own; and which will have the effect of reducing to the\r\nranks of the Pterichthyan genus the supposed genera _Pamphractus_ and\r\n_Homothorax_. A second set of fossils, which Dr. Emslie had derived from\r\nhis tile-works at Blackpots, proved, I found, identical with those of\r\nthe Eathie Lias. As this Banffshire deposit had formed a subject of\r\nconsiderable discussion and difference among geologists, I was curious\r\nto examine it; and the Doctor, though the day was still none of the\r\nbest, kindly walked out with me, to bring under my notice appearances\r\nwhich, in the haste of a first examination, I might possibly overlook,\r\nand to show me yet another set of fossils which he kept at the works. He\r\ninformed me, as we went, that the Grauwacke (Lower Silurian) deposits of\r\nthe district, hitherto deemed so barren, had recently yielded their\r\norganisms in a slate quarry at Gamrie-head; and that they belong to that\r\nancient family of the Pennatularia which, in this northern kingdom,\r\nseems to have taken precedence of all the others. Judging from what now\r\nappears, the Graptolite must be regarded as the first settler who\r\nsquatted for a living in that deep-sea area of undefined boundary\r\noccupied at the present time by the bold wave-worn headlands and blue\r\nhills of Scotland; and this new Banffshire locality not only greatly\r\nextends the range of the fossil in reference to the kingdom, but also\r\nestablishes, in a general way, the fossiliferous identity of the Lower\r\nSilurian deposits to the north of the Grampians with that of\r\nPeebles-shire and Galloway in the south,--so far as I know, the only\r\nother two Scottish districts in which this organism has been found.\r\n\r\nThe argillaceous deposit of Blackpots occupies, in the form of a green\r\nswelling bank, a promontory rather soft than bold in its contour, that\r\nprojects far into the sea, and forms, when tipped with its slim column\r\nof smoke from the tile-kiln, a pleasing feature in the landscape. I had\r\nset it down on the previous day, when it first caught my eye from the\r\nlofty cliffs of Gamrie-head, at the distance of some ten or twelve\r\nmiles, as different in character from all the other features of the\r\nprospect. The country generally is moulded on a framework of primary\r\nrock, and presents headlands of hard, sharp outline, to the attrition of\r\nthe waves; whereas this single headland in the midst,--soft-lined,\r\nundulatory, and plump,--seems suited to remind one of Burns's young Kirk\r\nAlloway beauty disporting amid the thin old ladies that joined with her\r\nin the dance. And it _is_ a greatly younger beauty than the Cambrian and\r\nmica-schist protuberances that encroach on the sea on either side of it.\r\nThe sheds and kilns of a tile-work occupy the flat terminal point of the\r\npromontory; and as the clay is valuable, in this tile-draining age, for\r\nthe facility with which it can be moulded into pipe-tiles (a purpose\r\nwhich the ordinary clays of the north of Scotland, composed chiefly of\r\nre-formations of the Old Red Sandstone, are what is technically termed\r\ntoo _short_ to serve), it is gradually retreating inland before the\r\npersevering spade and mattock of the laborer. The deposit has already\r\nbeen drawn out into many hundred miles of cylindrical pipes, and is\r\ndestined to be drawn out into many thousands more,--such being one of\r\nthe strange metamorphoses effected in the geologic formations, now that\r\nthat curious animal the Bimana has come upon the stage; and at length it\r\nwill have no existence in the country, save as an immense system of\r\nveins and arteries underlying the vegetable mould. Will these veins and\r\narteries, I marvel, form, in their turn, the _fossils_ of another\r\nperiod, when a higher platform than that into which they have been laid\r\nwill be occupied to the full by plants and animals specifically\r\ndifferent from those of the present scene of things,--the existences of\r\na happier and more finished creation? My business to-day, however, was\r\nwith the fossils which the deposit now contains,--not with those which\r\nit may ultimately form.\r\n\r\nThe Blackpots clay is of a dark-bluish or greenish-gray color, and so\r\nadhesive, that I now felt, when walking among it, after the softening\r\nrains of the previous night and morning, as if I had got into a bed of\r\nbird-lime. It is thinly charged with rolled pebbles, septaria, and\r\npieces of a bituminous shale, containing broken Belemnites, and\r\nsorely-flattened Ammonites, that exist as thin films of a white chalky\r\nlime. The pebbles, like those of the boulder-clay of the northern side\r\nof the Moray Frith, are chiefly of the primary rocks and older\r\nsandstones, and were probably in the neighborhood, in their present\r\nrolled form, long ere the re-formation of the inclosing mass; while the\r\nshale and the septaria are, as shown by their fossils, decidedly Liasic.\r\nI detected among the conchifers a well-marked species of our northern\r\nLias, figured by Sowerby from Eathie specimens,--the _Plagiostoma\r\nconcentrica_; and among the Cephalopoda, though considerably broken,\r\nthe _Belemnite elongatus_ and _Belemnite lanceolata_, with the _Ammonite\r\nKoenigi_ (_mutabilis_),--all Eathie shells. I, besides, found in the\r\nbank a piece of a peculiar-looking quartzose sandstone, traversed by\r\nhard jaspedeous veins of a brownish-gray color, which I have never\r\nfound, in Scotland at least, save associated with the Lias of our\r\nnorth-eastern coasts. Further, my attention was directed by Dr. Emslie\r\nto a fine Lignite in his collection, which had once formed some eighteen\r\ninches or two feet of the trunk of a straight slender pine,--probably\r\nthe _Pinites Eiggensis_,--in which, as in most woods of the Lias and\r\nOolite, the annual rings are as strongly marked as in the existing firs\r\nor larches of our hill-sides.[11] The Blackpots deposit is evidently a\r\nre-formation of a Liasic patch, identical, both in mineralogical\r\ncharacter and in its organic remains, with the lower beds of the Eathie\r\nLias; while the fragments of shale which it contains belong chiefly to\r\nan upper Liasic bed. So rich is the dark-colored tenacious argil of the\r\nInferior Lias of Eathie, that the geologist who walks over it when it is\r\nstill moist with the receding tide would do well to look to his\r\nfooting;--the mixture of soap and grease spread by the ship-carpenter\r\non his launch-slips, to facilitate the progress of his vessel seawards,\r\nis not more treacherous to the tread: while the Upper Liasic deposit\r\nwhich rests over it is composed of a dark slaty shale, largely charged\r\nwith bitumen. And of a Liasic deposit of this compound character,\r\nconsisting in larger part of an inferior argillaceous bed, and in lesser\r\npart of a superior one of dark shale, the tile-clay of Blackpots has\r\nbeen formed.\r\n\r\nI had next to determine whether aught remained to indicate the period of\r\nits re-formation. The tile-works at the point of the promontory rest on\r\na bed of shell-sand, composed exclusively, like the sand so abundant on\r\nthe western coast of Scotland, of fragments of existing shells. These,\r\nhowever, are so fresh and firm, that, though the stratum which they form\r\nseems to underlie the clay at its edges, I cannot regard them as older\r\nthan the most modern of our ancient sea-margins. They formed, in all\r\nprobability, in the days of the old coast line, a white shelly beach,\r\nunder such a precipitous front of the dark clay as argillaceous deposits\r\nalmost always present to the undermining wear of the waves. On the\r\nrecession of the sea, however, to its present line, the abrupt, steep\r\nfront, loosened by the frosts and washed by the rains, would of course\r\ngradually moulder down over them into a slope; and there would thus be\r\ncommunicated to the shelly stratum, at least at its edges, an underlying\r\ncharacter. The true period of the re-formation of the deposit was, I can\r\nhave no doubt, that of the boulder-clay. I observed that the septaria\r\nand larger masses of shale which the bed contains, bear, on\r\nroughly-polished surfaces, in the line of their larger axes, the\r\nmysterious groovings and scratchings of this period,--marks which I have\r\nnever yet known to fail in their chronological evidence. It may be\r\nmentioned, too, simply as a fact, though one of less value than the\r\nother, that the deposit occurs in its larger development exactly where,\r\nin the average, the boulder-clays also are most largely developed,--a\r\nlittle over that line where the waves for so many ages charged against\r\nthe coast, ere the last upheaval of the land or the recession of the sea\r\nsent them back to their present margin. There had probably existed to\r\nthe west or north-west of the deposit, perhaps in the middle of the open\r\nbay formed by the promontory on which it rests,--for the small\r\nproportion of other than Liasic materials which it contains serves to\r\nshow that it could be derived from no great distance,--an outlier of the\r\nLower Lias. The icebergs of the cold glacial period, propelled along the\r\nsubmerged land by some arctic current, or caught up by the gulf-stream,\r\ngradually grated it down, as a mason's laborer grates down the surface\r\nof the sandstone slab which he is engaged in polishing; and the\r\ncomminuted debris, borne eastwards by the current, was cast down here.\r\nIt has been stated that no Liasic remains have been found in the\r\nboulder-clays of Scotland. They are certainly rare in the boulder-clays\r\nof the northern shores of the Moray Frith; for there the nearest Lias,\r\nbearing in a western direction from the clay, is that of Applecross, on\r\nthe other side of the island; and the materials of the boulder-deposits\r\nof the north have invariably been derived in the line, westerly in its\r\ngeneral bearing, of the grooves and scratches of the iceberg era. But on\r\nthe southern shore of the frith, where that westerly line passed athwart\r\nthe Liasic beds of our eastern coast, organisms of the Lias are\r\ncomparatively common in the boulder-clays; and here, at Blackpots, we\r\nfind an extensive deposit of the same period formed of Liasic materials\r\nalmost exclusively. Fragments of still more modern rocks occur in the\r\nboulder-clays of Caithness. My friend Mr. Robert Dick, of Thurso, to\r\nwhose persevering labors and interesting discoveries in the Old Red\r\nSandstone of his locality I have had frequent occasion to refer, has\r\ndetected in a blue boulder-clay, scooped into precipitous banks by the\r\nriver Thorsa, fragments both of chalk-flints and a characteristic\r\nconglomerate of the Oolite. He has, besides, found it mottled from top\r\nto bottom, a full hundred feet over the sea-level, and about two miles\r\ninland, with comminuted fragments of existing shells. But of this more\r\nanon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     From Blackpots to Portsoy--Character of the Coast--Burn of\r\n     Boyne--Fever Phantoms--Graphic Granite--Maupertuis and the Runic\r\n     Inscription--Explanation of the _quo modo_ of Graphic\r\n     Granite--Portsoy Inn--Serpentine Beds--Portsoy Serpentine\r\n     unrivalled for small ornaments--Description of it--Significance of\r\n     the term _serpentine_--Elizabeth Bond and her \"Letters\"--From\r\n     Portsoy to Cullen--Attritive Power of the Ocean illustrated--The\r\n     Equinoctial--From Cullen to Fochabers--The Old Red again--The old\r\n     Pensioner--Fochabers--Mr. Joss, the learned Mail-guard--The Editor\r\n     a sort of Coach-guard--On the Coach to Elgin--Geology of\r\n     Banffshire--Irregular paging of the Geologic Leaves--Geologic Map\r\n     of the County like Joseph's Coat--Striking Illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\nI parted from Dr. Emslie, and walked on along the shore to Portsoy,--for\r\nthree-fourths of the way over the prevailing grauwacke of the county,\r\nand for the remaining fourth over mica schist, primary limestone,\r\nhornblende slate, granitic and quartz veins, and the various other\r\nkindred rocks of a primary district. The day was still gloomy and gray,\r\nand ill suited to improve homely scenery; nor is this portion of the\r\nBanff coast nearly so striking as that which I had travelled over the\r\nday before. It has, however, its spots of a redeeming character,--rocky\r\nrecesses on the shore, half-beach, half-sward, rich in wild-flowers and\r\nshells,--where one could saunter in a calm sunny morning, with one's\r\n_bairns_ about one, very delightfully; and the interior is here and\r\nthere agreeably undulated by diluvial hillocks, that, when the sun falls\r\nlow in the evening, must chequer the landscape with many a pleasing\r\nalternation of light and shadow. The Burn of Boyne,--which separates,\r\nabout two miles from Portsoy, a grauwacke from a mica-schist\r\ndistrict,--with its bare, open valley, its steep limestone banks, and\r\nits gray, melancholy castle, long since roofless and windowless, and\r\nsurrounded by a few stunted trees, bears a deserted and solitary\r\nshagginess about it, that struck me as wildly agreeable. It is such a\r\nvalley as one might expect to meet a ghost in, in some still, dewy\r\nevening, as gloamin was darkening into uncertainty the outlines of the\r\nancient ruin, and the newly-kindled stars looked down upon the stream.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, however, that my only story connected with either ruin\r\nor valley was as little a ghost story as might be. I remember that, when\r\nlying ill of fever on one occasion,--indisposed enough to see apparition\r\nafter apparition flitting across the bed-curtains, like the figures of a\r\nmagic lantern posting along the darkened wall, and yet self-possessed\r\nenough to know that they were but mere pictures in the eye, and to watch\r\nthem as they rose,--I set myself to determine whether they were in any\r\ndegree amenable to the will, or connected by the ordinary associative\r\nlinks of the metaphysician. Fixing my mind on a certain object, I strove\r\nto call it up in the character, not of an image of the conceptive\r\nfaculty, but of a fever-vision on the retina. The image which I pictured\r\nto myself was that of a death's head, yellow and grim, and lighted up,\r\nas if from within, amid the darkness of a burial vault. But the death's\r\nhead obstinately refused to rise. I had no control, I found, over the\r\nfever imagery. And the picture that rose instead, uncalled and\r\nunexpected, was that of a coal-fire burning brightly in a grate, with a\r\nhuge tea-kettle steaming cheerily over it.\r\n\r\nIn traversing the bare height which, rising on the western side of the\r\nvalley of the Boyne, owes its comparatively bold relief in the landscape\r\nto the firmness of the primary rock which composes it, I picked up a\r\npiece of graphic granite, bearing its inlaid characters of dark quartz\r\non a ground of cream-colored feldspar. This variety, however, though\r\noccasionally found in rolled boulders in the neighborhood of Portsoy, is\r\nnot the graphic granite for which the locality is famous, and which\r\noccurs in a vein in the mica schist of the eminence I was now\r\ntraversing, about a mile to the east of the town. The prevailing ground\r\nof the granite of the vein is a flesh-colored feldspar; and the\r\nthickly-marked quartzose characters with which it is set, greatly\r\nsmaller and paler than in the cream-colored stone, bear less the antique\r\nHebraic look, and would scarce deceive even the most credulous\r\nantiquary. Antiquarians, however, _have_ been sometimes deceived by\r\nweathered specimens of this graphic rock, in which the characters were\r\nof considerable size, and restricted to thin veins, covering the surface\r\nof a schistose groundwork. Maupertuis, during his famous journey to\r\nLapland, undertaken in 1737, to establish, from actual measurement, that\r\nthe degrees of latitude are longer towards the pole than at the equator,\r\nand which demonstrated, of consequence, the true figure of the earth,\r\ntravelled thirty leagues out of his way, through a wild country covered\r\nwith snow, to examine an ancient monument, of which, he says, \"the Fins\r\nand Laplanders frequently spoke, as containing in its inscription the\r\nknowledge of everything of which they were ignorant.\" He found it on the\r\nside of a mountain, buried in snow; and ascertained, after kindling a\r\ngreat fire around it, in order to lay it bare, that it was a stone of\r\nirregular form, composed of various layers of unequal hardness, and that\r\nthe characters, which were rather more than an inch in length, were\r\nwritten on \"a layer of a species of flint,\" chiefly in two lines, with a\r\nfew scattered signs beneath, while the rest of the mass was composed of\r\na rock more soft and foliated. Graphic granite, it may be mentioned,\r\ngenerally occurs, not in masses, but in veins and layers. The\r\ninscription had been described in a previously published dissertation of\r\nimmense erudition, as Runic; but a Runic scholar of the party found he\r\ncould make nothing of it. The philosopher himself was struck by the\r\nfrequent repetition of characters of nearly the same form on the stone;\r\nbut he was ingenious enough to get over the difficulty, by remembering\r\nthat in our notation, after the Arabic manner, characters shaped exactly\r\nalike may be very frequently repeated,--nay, as in some of the lines of\r\nthe Lapland inscription, may succeed each other, as in the sums I. II.\r\nIII. IIII. or X. XX. XXX.,--and yet very distinct and definite ideas\r\nattach to them all. Still, however, he could not, he says, venture on\r\nauthoritatively deciding whether the inscription was a work of man or a\r\nsport of nature. He stood between his two conclusions, like our\r\nEdinburgh antiquarians between the two fossil Maries of Gueldres; and,\r\nricher in eloquence than most of the philosophers his contemporaries,\r\nwas quite prepared, in his uncertainty, to give gilded mounting and a\r\npurple pall to both.\r\n\r\n\"Should it be no other than a sport of nature,\" he concludes, \"the\r\nreputation which the stone bears in this country deserves that we should\r\nhave given a description of it. If, on the other hand, what is on it be\r\nan inscription, though it certainly does not possess the beauty of the\r\nsculpture of Greece or Rome, it very possibly has the advantage of being\r\nthe oldest in the universe. The country in which it is found is\r\ninhabited only by a race of men who live like beasts in the forests. We\r\ncannot imagine that they can have ever had any memorable event to\r\ntransmit to posterity, nor, if ever they had had, that they could have\r\ninvented the means. Nor can it be conceived that this country, with its\r\npresent aspect, ever possessed more civilized inhabitants. The rigor of\r\nthe climate and the barrenness of the land have destined it for the\r\nretreat of a few miserable wretches, who know no other. It seems,\r\ntherefore, that the inscription must have been cut at a period when the\r\ncountry was situated in a different climate, and before some one of\r\nthose great revolutions which, we cannot doubt, have taken place on our\r\nglobe. The position that the earth's axis holds at present with respect\r\nto the ecliptic, occasions Lapland to receive the sun's rays very\r\nobliquely: it is therefore condemned to a long winter, adverse to man,\r\nas well as to all the productions of nature. No great movement,\r\npossibly, in the heavens was necessary, however, to cause all its\r\nmisfortunes. These regions may formerly have been those on which the sun\r\nshone most favorably; the polar circles may have been what now the\r\ntropics are, and the torrid zone have filled the place occupied by the\r\ntemperate.\" Pretty well, Monsieur, for a philosopher! The various\r\nattempts made to unriddle the real history of graphic granite are,\r\nhowever, scarce less curious than the speculations connected with what\r\nmay be termed its romance. It seems to be generally held, since the days\r\nof old Hutton, who, in his \"Theory of the Earth,\" discussed the subject\r\nwith his usual ingenuity, that the feldspathic basis of the stone first\r\ncrystallized, leaving interstices between the crystals, partaking of a\r\ncertain regularity of form,--a consequence of the regularity of the\r\ncrystals themselves,--and of a certain irregularity from the eccentric\r\ndispositions which these manifest in their position and relations to\r\neach other; and that these interstices, being afterwards filled up with\r\nquartz, form the characters of the rock,--characters partaking enough of\r\nthe first element of _regularity_ to present their peculiar graphic\r\nappearance, and enough of the second element of _irregularity_ to\r\nexhibit forms of an alphabet-like variety of outline. The chemist,\r\nhowever, in cross-questioning the explanation, has his puzzle to\r\npropound regarding it. Quartz, he says, being considerably less fusible\r\nthan feldspar, would naturally consolidate first, and so would give form\r\nto the more fusible substance, instead of deriving form from it. On what\r\nprinciple, then, is it that, reversing its ordinary character, it should\r\nhave been the last of the two substances to consolidate in the graphic\r\ngranite?--a query to which there seems to be no direct reply, but which\r\nas little affects the fact that it _was_ the substance which last\r\nconsolidated, and which took form from the other, as the decision of the\r\nlearned Strasburgers, which determined the impossibility of the long\r\nnose in Slawkenbergius's Tale, affected the actual existence of that\r\nremarkable feature. \"It happens _to be_, notwithstanding your\r\nobjection,\" said the controversialists on the pro-nose side of the\r\nquestion. \"But it _ought not_,\" replied their opponents.\r\n\r\nThe rain again returned as I was engaged in examining the graphic\r\ngranite of the Portsoy vein; the breeze from the sea heightened into a\r\ngale, that soon fringed the coast with a broad border of foam; and I\r\nentered the town, which looked but indifferently well in its gray\r\ndishabille of haze and spray, tolerably wet and worn, with but the\r\nprospect before me of being weather-bound for the rest of the day. I\r\nfound an old-fashioned inn, kept by somewhat old-fashioned people, who\r\nhad lately come from the country to \"open a public;\" and ensconced\r\nmyself by the fireside, in a huge many-windowed room, that must have\r\nwitnessed the county dinners of at least a century ago. Soon wearying,\r\nhowever, of hearing the rain beating mad-like ratans upon the panes, and\r\navailing myself of a comparatively \"lucid interval,\" I sallied out,\r\nwrapped up in my plaid, to examine the serpentine beds in the\r\nneighborhood, which produce what is so extensively known as the Portsoy\r\nmarble. The _beds_ or _veins_ of this substance,--for it is still a moot\r\npoint whether they occur here as mere insulated masses of contemporary\r\norigin with the primary formations which surround them, or as Plutonic\r\ndykes injected into fissures at a later period,--are of very\r\nconsiderable extent, one of them measuring about twenty-five yards\r\nacross, and another considerably more than a quarter of a mile; and, had\r\nthey but the solidity of the true marbles, they would scarce fail to be\r\nregarded as valuable quarries of a highly ornamental stone, admirably\r\nsuited for the interior decorations of the architect. But they are\r\nunluckily what the quarrier would term rubbly,--traversed by an infinity\r\nof cracks and fissures; and it is rare indeed to find a continuous mass\r\nout of which a chimney-jamb or lintel could be fashioned. The serpentine\r\nwas wrought here considerably more than a century and a half ago, and\r\nexported to France for the magnificent Palace of Versailles; which,\r\nthough regarded by the French nation, says Voltaire, as \"a favorite\r\nwithout merit,\" Louis the Fourteenth persisted at the time in lavishly\r\nbeautifying, and looked as for abroad as Portsoy for materials with\r\nwhich to adorn it. I have, however, seen it stated that the greater part\r\nof a ship's cargo, brought afterwards to Paris on speculation, was\r\nsuffered to lie unwrought for years in the stone-dealer's yard, and was\r\nultimately disposed of as rubbish,--a consequence, probably, of its\r\nunfitness, from its shaky texture, for ornamental purposes on a large\r\nscale, though for ornaments of the smaller kind, such as boxes, vases,\r\nand plates, it has been pronounced unrivalled. \"At Zoeblitz, in Upper\r\nSaxony,\" says Professor Jamieson, \"several hundred people are employed\r\nin quarrying, cutting, turning, and polishing the serpentine which\r\noccurs in that neighborhood; and the various articles into which it is\r\nmanufactured are carried all over Germany. The serpentine of Portsoy,\"\r\nhe adds, \"is, however, far superior to that of Zoeblitz, in color,\r\nhardness, and transparency, and, when cut, is very beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nIt is really a pretty stone; and, bad as the evening was, it was by no\r\nmeans one of the worst of evenings for seeing it to advantage _in situ_,\r\nor among the rolled pebbles on the shore. The varnish-like gloss of the\r\nwet imparted to the undressed masses all the effect of polish, and\r\nbrought out in their proper variegations of color, every cloud, streak,\r\nand vein. Viewed in the mass, the general hue is green; so much so, that\r\nan insulated stack, which stands abreast of one of the beds, a\r\nstone-cast in the sea, has greatly the appearance, at a little distance,\r\nof an immense mass of verdigris. But red, gray, and brown are also\r\nprevailing colors in the rock; occasional veins and blotches of white\r\ngive lightness to the darker portions; and veins of hematitic and deep\r\numbry tints, variety to the portions that are lighter. The greens vary\r\nfrom the palest olive to the deepest black-green of the mineralogist;\r\nthe reds and browns, from blood-red to dark chocolate, and from\r\nwood-brown to brownish-black; and, thus various in shade, they occur in\r\nalmost every possible variety of combination and form,--dotted, spotted,\r\nclouded, veined,--so that each separate pebble on the shore seems the\r\nrepresentative of a rock different from the rocks represented by almost\r\nall the others. Though not much of a mineralogist, I could have spent\r\nconsiderably more time than the weather permitted me to employ this\r\nevening, in admiring the beauties of this beach of _marbles_, or\r\nrather,--as the real name, derived from those gorgeous, many-colored\r\ncloudings, that impart a terrible splendor to the skins of the snake and\r\nviper family, is not only the more correct, but also the more poetical\r\nof the two,--this beach of _serpentines_. I had, however, to compromise\r\nmatters between the fierce wind and rain and the pretty rocks and\r\npebbles, by adjourning to the workshop of the Portsoy lapidary, Mr.\r\nClark, and examining under cover his polished specimens, of which I\r\npurchased for a few shillings a characteristic and elegant little set.\r\nPortsoy is peculiarly rich in minerals; and hence it reckons among its\r\nmechanics of the ordinary class, what perhaps no other village in\r\nScotland of the same size and population possesses,--a skilful lapidary.\r\nMr. Clark's collection of the graphic granites, serpentines, and talcose\r\nand mica schists, of the district, with their associated minerals, such\r\nas schorl, talc, asbestos, amianthus, mountain cork, steatite, and\r\nschiller spar, will be found eminently worthy a visit by the passing\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\nI made several inquiries in the village, though not, as it proved, in\r\nthe right direction, regarding a poor old lady, several years dead, of\r\nwhom I had known a very little considerably more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury before, and whose grave I would have visited, bad as the night\r\nwas, had I met any one who could have pointed it out to me. But\r\nungrateful Portsoy seemed to have forgotten poor Miss Bond, who, in all\r\nher printed letters and little stories, so rarely forgot _it_. Have any\r\nof my readers ever seen the work (in two slim volumes), \"Letters of a\r\nVillage Governess,\" published in 1814 by Elizabeth Bond, and dedicated\r\nto Sir Walter Scott? If not, and should they chance to see, as I lately\r\ndid, a copy on a stall (with uncut leaves, alas! and selling dog cheap),\r\nthey might possibly do worse things than buy it.[12]\r\n\r\nWith better weather I could have spent a day or two very agreeably in\r\nPortsoy and its neighborhood; but the rain dashed unceasingly, and made\r\nexploration under the cover of the umbrella somewhat resemble that of a\r\nsea-bottom under cover of the diving-bell. I could see but little at a\r\ntime, and the little imperfectly. Miss Bond, in her \"Letters,\" refers,\r\nin her light, pleasing style, to what in more favorable circumstances\r\n_might_ be seen. \"My troop of _light infantry_,\" she says, \"keeps me so\r\nwell employed here during the day, that the silence and repose of the\r\nevening is very delightful. In fine weather I walk by the sea-side, and\r\nscramble among the rugged rocks, many of which are inaccessible to human\r\nfeet, forming a fine retreat for foxes. These animals often may be seen\r\nfrom the heights, sporting with their cubs in perfect safety. This day I\r\nwent to see the works of an old _virtuoso_, who turns in marble, or\r\nrather granite [serpentine] all kinds of chimney-piece ornaments, rings,\r\near-rings, etc. Several specimens of his work, which must have cost him\r\na vast deal of trouble, I thought very beautiful. It was in this\r\nneighborhood that the celebrated Ferguson spent so much of his time. The\r\nglobular stones on the gate of Durn are still to be seen, on which he\r\nmapped out the figuring of the terrestrial and celestial globes. I was\r\ntold it was forbidden ground to approach the premises of Durn; but I\r\ncould not resist the temptation of visiting the spot where the young\r\nphilosopher had shown such early proofs of his genius; and I accordingly\r\npaid the forfeit of an _impertinent_, for the gentleman who resides\r\nthere caught the prowler, and in genteel terms bade her go about her\r\nbusiness, and never return. How ungracious! She was doing no harm.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning arose as gloomily as the evening had fallen; and I walked on\r\nin the rain to Cullen, fully disposed to sympathize by the way with the\r\n\"hardy Byron,\"--he of the \"Narrative,\"--who, from his ill-luck in\r\nweather, went among his sailors by the name of \"Foul-weather Jack.\" In\r\nthe sandy bay of Cullen, where the road, after inflecting inland for\r\nsome five or six miles, comes again upon the sea, I found the surf\r\ncharging home in long white lines six waves deep,--\r\n\r\n \"Each stepping where his comrade stood,\r\n The instant that he fell.\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance was such as to impart no inadequate idea of the vast\r\nattritive power of ocean in wearing down the land. When pausing for a\r\nlittle abreast of the fishing village, partially sheltered by an old\r\nboat, to mark the fierce turmoil, it suddenly occurred to me,--as the\r\ntempest weltered around reef and skerry, and roared wildly, mile after\r\nmile, along the beach,--that the day and night were now just equal, and\r\nthat it was the customary equinoctial storm that had broken out to\r\naccompany me on my journey. And so, calculating on a few days more of\r\nit, instead of waiting on in the hope of a fair afternoon to examine the\r\noutlier of Old Red which occurs in the neighborhood of Cullen, I was\r\ncontent to see at a distance its mural-sided cliffs rising like broken\r\nwalls through the flat sand; and, taking the road for Fochabers, with\r\nthe intention of leaving exploration till fairer weather set in, I\r\nresolved on posting straight on, to join my relatives on the opposite\r\nside of the Frith. The deep-red color of the boulder-clay, as exhibited\r\nby the way-side, in the water-courses and the water,--for every runnel\r\nwas tumbling down big and turbid with the rains,--intimated, when, after\r\nleaving Cullen some six or seven miles behind me, I passed from a bare\r\nmoory region of quartz rock into a region of woods and fields, that I\r\nwas again upon my ancient acquaintance, the Old Red Sandstone. And the\r\nsection furnished by the Burn of Tynet showed me shortly after that the\r\nintimation was a correct one, and how generally it may be laid down as a\r\nrule, that at least the more impalpable portions of the boulder-clay are\r\nderived from the rocks on which it rests. The ichthyolite beds appear in\r\nthe course of the burn. They have furnished several good\r\nspecimens,--among the others, the specimen of Coccosteus figured by Mr.\r\nPatrick Duff in his \"Sketches of the Geology of Moray;\" and they are,\r\nbesides, curious, as being the first to exhibit to the traveller who\r\nexplores from Gamrie westwards, that peculiar style of coloring which\r\ncharacterizes the Old Red ichthyolites of the shires of Moray and Nairn,\r\nand which differs so strikingly from the more sombre style exhibited by\r\nthe other ichthyolites of Banffshire, with those of Cromarty, Ross,\r\nCaithness, and Orkney. Instead of bearing, like these, one uniform hue,\r\nas if deeply shaded with Indian ink, they are gorgeously attired,\r\nespecially when newly laid open, in white, red, purple, and blue. The\r\nday, however, was ill-suited for fishing Pterichthyes and Osteolepi out\r\nof the Tynet: the red water was roaring from bank to brae; here eddying\r\nalong the half-submerged furze,--there tearing down the boulder-days in\r\nraw, red land-slips; and so, casting but one eager glance at the bed\r\nwhere the fish lay, I travelled on, and entered the tall woods to the\r\neast of Fochabers. The rain ceased for a time; and I met in the woods an\r\nold pensioner, who had been evidently weather-bound in some\r\npublic-house, and had now taken the opportunity of the fair interval to\r\nstagger to his dwelling. He was eminently, exuberantly happy,--there\r\ncould not be two opinions on that head,--full of all manner of bright\r\nsunshiny thoughts and imaginations, rendered just a little tremulous and\r\nuncertain by the _summer-heat_ exhalations of the imbibed moisture, like\r\ndistant objects in a hot noonday landscape in July seen through volumes\r\nof rising vapor; and a sheep's head and trotters, which he carried under\r\nhis arm, was, I saw, to serve as a peace-offering to his wife at home.\r\nTrue, he had been taking a dram, but he was mindful of the family for\r\nall that. He confronted me with the air of an old acquaintance; gave the\r\nmilitary salute; and then, laying hold of a corner of my plaid with his\r\nthumb and forefinger,--\"I know you,\" he said, \"I know _your kind_ well;\r\nye're a Highland-Donald. Od, I've seen ye in the _thick o't_. Ye're\r\n_reugh_ fellows when ye're bluid's up!\" He had taken me for a grenadier\r\nof the 42d; and I lacked the moral courage to undeceive him. I met\r\nnothing further on my way worthy of record, save and except a sheep's\r\ntrotter, dropped by the old pensioner in one of his zig-zaggings to the\r\nextreme left; but having no particular use for the trotter at the time\r\nand in the circumstances, I left it to benefit the next passer-by. I\r\nfinished my journey of eighteen miles in capital style, and was within\r\nfive minutes' walk of Fochabers when the horn of the mail-guard was\r\nsounding up the street. And, entering the village, I found the vehicle\r\nstanding opposite the inn door, minus the horses.\r\n\r\nThe _insides_ and _outsides_ were sitting down to dinner together as I\r\nentered the inn; and I felt, after my long walk, that it would be rather\r\nan agreeable matter to join with them. But in the hope of meeting my old\r\nfriend Mr. Joss, I requested to be shown, not into the passengers' room,\r\nbut into that of the coachman and guard; and with them I dined. It so\r\nchanced, however, that Mr. Joss was not _out_ that day; and the man in\r\nthe red long coat was a stranger whom I had never seen before. I\r\ninquired of him regarding Mr. Joss,--one of perhaps the most remarkable\r\nmail-guards in Europe. I have at least never heard of another who, like\r\nhim, amuses his leisure on the coach-top with the \"Principia\" of Newton,\r\nand understands it. And the man, drawing his inference from the interest\r\nin Mr. Joss which my queries evinced, asked me whether I myself was not\r\na coach-guard. \"No,\" I rather thoughtlessly replied, \"I am not a\r\ncoach-guard.\" Half a minute's consideration, however, led me to doubt\r\nwhether I had given the right answer. \"I am not sure,\" I said to\r\nmyself, on second thoughts, \"but the man has cut pretty fairly on the\r\npoint;--I daresay _I am_ a sort of coach-guard. I have to mount my\r\ntwice-a-week coach in all weathers, like any mail-guard among them all;\r\nI have to start at the appointed hour, whether the vehicle be empty or\r\nfull; I have to keep a sharp eye on the opposition coaches; I am\r\nresponsible, like any other mail-guard, for all the parcels carried,\r\nhowever little I may have had to do with the making of them up; I have\r\nalways to keep my blunderbuss full charged to the muzzle,--not wishing\r\nharm to any one, but bound in duty to let drive at all and sundry who\r\nwould make war upon the passengers, or attempt running the conveyance\r\noff the road; and, finally, as my friend Mr. Joss takes the \"Principia\"\r\nto _his_ coach-top, I take pockets full of fossils to the top of mine,\r\nand amuse myself in fine days by working out, as I best can, the\r\nproblems which they furnish. Yes, I rather think _I am_ a coach-guard.\"\r\nAnd so, taking my seat beside my red-coated brother, who had guessed the\r\ntrue nature of my occupation so much more shrewdly than myself, I rode\r\non to Elgin, where I passed the night.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to arrange in the mind the geologic formations of\r\nBanffshire in their character as a series of deposits. The pages of the\r\nstony record which the county composes, like those of an\r\nunskilfully-folded pamphlet, have been strangely mixed together, so that\r\npage last succeeds in some places to page first, and, of the\r\nintermediate pages, some appear at the beginning of the work, and some\r\nat the end. It is not until we reach the western confines of the county,\r\nsome two or three miles short of the river Spey, its terminal boundary\r\nin this direction, that we find the beds comparatively little disturbed,\r\nand arranged chronologically in their original places. In the eastern\r\nand southern parts of the shire, rocks widely separated by the date of\r\ntheir formation have been set down side by side in patches,\r\noccasionally of but inconsiderable extent. Now the traveller passes over\r\na district of grauwacke, now over a re-formation of the Lias; anon he\r\nfinds himself on a primary limestone,--gneiss, syenite, clay-slate, or\r\nquartz-rock; and yet anon amid the fossils of some outlier of the Old\r\nRed. The geological map of the county is, like Joseph's coat, of many\r\ncolors. I remember seeing, when a boy, more years ago than I am inclined\r\nto specify, some workmen engaged in pulling down what had been a\r\nhouse-painter's shop, a full century before. The painter had been in the\r\nsomewhat slovenly habit of cleaning his brushes by rubbing them against\r\na hard-cast wall, which was covered, in consequence, by a many-colored\r\nlayer of paint, a full half-inch in thickness, and as hard as a stone.\r\nTaking a little bit home with me, I polished it by rubbing the upper\r\nsurface smooth; and, lo! a geological map. The _strata_ of variously\r\nhued pigment, spread originally over the surface of the hard-cast wall,\r\nwere cut open, by the _denudation_ of the grindstone, into all manner of\r\nfantastic forms, and seemed thrown into all sorts of strange\r\nneighborhoods. The _map_ lacked merely the additional perplexity of a\r\nfew bold _faults_, with here and there a decided _dike_, in order to\r\nrender it on a small scale a sort of miniature transcript of the geology\r\nof Banff; and I have very frequently found my thoughts reverting to it,\r\nin connection with deposits of this broken character. On a rough\r\n_hard-cast_ basis of granite I have laid down in imagination, as if by\r\nway of priming, coat after coat of the primary rocks,--gneiss, and\r\nstratified hornblend, and mica-schist, and quartz-rock, and day-slate;\r\nand then, after breaking the coatings well up, and rubbing them well\r\ndown, and so spoiling and crumpling up the work as to make their\r\noriginal order considerably a puzzle, I have begun anew to paint over\r\nthe rough surface with thick coatings of grauwacke and grauwacke-slate.\r\nWhen this part of the operation was completed, I have again begun\r\nto break up and grind down,--here letting a tract of grauwacke\r\nsink into the broken primary,--there wearing it off the surface\r\naltogether,--yonder elevating the original granitic _hard-cast_ till it\r\nrose over all the coatings, Primary and Palaeozoic. And then I have begun\r\nto paint yet a third time with thick Old Red Sandstone pigment; and yet\r\nagain to break up and wear down,--here to insert a tenon of the Old Red\r\ndeep into a mortise of the grauwacke, as at Gamrie,--there to dovetail\r\nit into the clay-slate, as at Tomantoul,--yonder, after laying it across\r\nthe upturned quartz-rock, as at Cullen, to rub by much the greater part\r\nof it away again, leaving but mere remainder-patches and fragments, to\r\nmark where it had been. Lastly, if I had none of the superior Palaeozoic\r\nor Secondary formations to deal with, I have brushed over the whole, by\r\nway of finish, with the variously-derived coatings of the superficial\r\ndeposits; and thus, as I have said, I have often completed, in idea,\r\nafter the chance suggestion of the old painter's shop, my portable\r\nmodels of the geology of disturbed districts like the Banffshire one.\r\nThe deposits of Moray are greatly less broken. Denudation has partially\r\nworn them down; but they seem to have almost wholly escaped the previous\r\ncrumpling process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     Yellow-hued Houses Of Elgin--Geology of the Country indicated by\r\n     the coloring of the Stone Houses--Fossils of Old Red north of the\r\n     Grampians different from those of Old Red south--Geologic\r\n     Formations at Linksfield difficult to be understood--Ganoid Scales\r\n     of the Wealden--Sudden Reaction, from complex to simple, in the\r\n     Scales of Fishes--Pore-covered Scales--Extraordinary amount of\r\n     Design exhibited in Ancient Ganoid Scales--Holoptychius Scale\r\n     illustrated by Cromwell's \"fluted pot\"--Patrick Duff's Geological\r\n     Collection--Elgin Museum--Fishes of the Ganges--Armature of Ancient\r\n     Fishes--Compensatory Defences--The Hermit-crab--Spines of the\r\n     Pimelodi--Ride to Campbelton--Theories of the formation of\r\n     Ardersier and Fortrose Promontories--Tradition of their\r\n     construction by the Wizard, Michael Scott--A Region of Legendary\r\n     Lore.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prevailing yellow hue of the Elgin houses strikes the eye of the\r\ngeologist who has travelled northwards from the Frith of Forth. He takes\r\nleave of a similar stone at Cupar-Fife,--a warmly-tinted yellow\r\nsandstone, peculiarly well-suited for giving effect to architectural\r\nornament; and after passing along the deep-red sandstone houses of the\r\nshires of Angus and Kincardine, and the gneiss, granite, hyperstene, and\r\nmica-schist houses of Aberdeen and Banff shires, he again finds houses\r\nof a deep red on crossing the Spey, and houses of a warm yellow tint on\r\nreaching Elgin,--geologically the Cupar-Fife of the north. And the story\r\nthat the colored buildings tell him is, that he has been passing, though\r\nby a somewhat circuitous route of a hundred and fifty miles, over an\r\nanticlinal geological section,--_down_ in the scale till he reached\r\nAberdeen and had gone a little beyond it, and then _up_ again, until at\r\nElgin he arrives at the same superior yellow bed of Old Red Sandstone\r\nwhich he had quitted at Cupar-Fife. Both beds contain the same\r\norganisms. The Holoptychius of Dura Den, near Cupar, must have sprung\r\nfrom the same original as the Holoptychius of the Hospital and\r\nBishop-Mill quarries near Elgin; and it seems not improbable that the\r\ntwo beds, thus identical in their character and contents, may have\r\nexisted, ere the upheaval of the Grampians broke their continuity, as an\r\nextended deposit, at the bottom of the same sea. But with this last and\r\nnewest of the formations of the Old Red Sandstone the identity of the\r\ndeposits to the south and north ceases. The strata which in the south\r\noverlie the yellow bed of the Holoptychius represent the Carboniferous\r\nperiod, the overlying strata in the north represent the Oolitic one. On\r\nthe one side the miner sinks his shaft, and finds a true coal, composed\r\nof the Stigmaria, Calamites, Club-mosses, Ferns, and Araucarians of the\r\nPalaeozoic era; he sinks his shaft on the other side, and finds but thin\r\nseams of an imperfect lignite, composed of the Cycadeae, Pines,\r\nSphenopteri, and Clathraria of the Secondary period. The flora which\r\nfound its subsoil in the Old Red Sandstone north of the Grampians,\r\nbelonged to a scene of things so much more modern than the flora which\r\nfound its subsoil in the Old Red Sandstone of the south, that all its\r\nproductions were green and flourishing, waving beside lake, river, and\r\nsea, at a time when the productions of the other were locked up, as now,\r\nin sand and shale, lime and clay,--the dead mummies of ages long\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nAnother thoroughly wet morning! varied only from the morning of the\r\npreceding day by the absence of wind, and the greater weight of the\r\npersevering vertical rain, that leaped upwards in myriads of little\r\ndancing pyramids from the surface of every pool. I walked out under\r\ncover of my umbrella, to renew my acquaintance with the outlier of the\r\nWeald at Linksfield, and ascertain what sort of section it now presented\r\nunder the quarrying operations of the limeburners. There was, however,\r\nlittle to be seen; the bands of green and blue clays, alternating with\r\nstrata of fossiliferous limestone, and layers of a gray shade, thickly\r\ncharged with minute shells of Cypris, were sadly blurred this morning by\r\nthe trail of numerous slips from above, which had fallen during the\r\nrains, and softened into mud as they rushed downwards athwart the face\r\nof the quarry: and the arched band of boulder-clay which so mysteriously\r\nunderlies the deposit was, save in a few parts, wholly covered up by the\r\ndebris. The occurrence of the clay here as an inferior bed, with but the\r\ncornstone of the Old Red beneath, and all the beds of the Weald resting\r\nover it, forms a riddle somewhat difficult of solution; but it is\r\npalpably not reading it aright to regard the deposit, with at least one\r\ngeologist who has written on the subject, as older than the rocks above.\r\nIt is, on the contrary, as a vast amount of various and unequivocal\r\nevidence demonstrates, incalculably more modern; nay, we find proof of\r\nthe fact here in that very bed which has been instanced as rendering it\r\ndoubtful; the clay of which the interpolation is composed is found to\r\ncontain fragments, not only of the cornstone on which it rests, but also\r\nof the Wealden limestone and shales which it underlies. It forms the\r\nmere filling up of a flat-roofed cavern, or rather of two flat-roofed\r\ncaverns,--for the limestone roof dipped in the centre to the cornstone\r\nfloor,--which, previous to the times of the boulder-clay, had lain open\r\nin what was then, as now, an old-world deposit, charged with long\r\nextinct organisms, but which, during the iceberg period, was penetrated\r\nand occupied by the clay, as run lime penetrates and occupies the\r\ninterstices of a dry-stone wall. It was no day for gathering fossils. I\r\nsaw a few ganoid scales, washed by the rain from the investing rubbish,\r\nglittering on fragments of the limestone, with a few of the\r\ncharacteristic shells of the deposit, chiefly Unionidae; but nothing\r\nworth bringing away. The adhesive clay of the Weald, widely scattered\r\nby the workmen, and wrought into mortar by the beating rains, made it a\r\nmatter of some difficulty for the struggling foot to retain the shoe,\r\nand, sticking to my soles by pounds at a time, rendered me obnoxious to\r\nthe old English nickname of \"rough-footed Scot.\" And so, after\r\ntraversing the heaps, somewhat like a fly in treacle, I had to yield to\r\nthe rain above and the mud beneath, and to return to do in Elgin what\r\ncannot be done equally well in almost any other town of its size in\r\nScotland,--pursue my geological inquiries under cover.\r\n\r\nOn this, as on other occasions, I was struck by the complex and very\r\nvarious forms assumed by the ganoid scales of the Wealden. Throughout\r\nthe Oolitic system generally, including the Lias, there obtains a\r\nsingular complexity of type in these little glittering tiles of\r\nenamelled bone, which contrasts strongly with the greatly more simple\r\nstyle which obtained among the ganoids of the Palaeozoic period. In many\r\nof these last, as in the Coelacanth family, including the genera\r\nHoloptychius, Asterolepis, and Glyptolepis, in all their many species,\r\nwith at least one genus of Dipterians, the genus Dipterus, the external\r\noutline and arrangement of scale was as simple as in any of the Cycloid\r\nfamily of the present time. Like slates on a roof, each single scale\r\ncovered two, and was covered by two in turn; and the only point of\r\ndifference which existed in relation to the _laying down_ of these massy\r\n_slates_ of _bone_, and the laying down of the very thin ones of _horn_\r\nwhich cover fish such as the carp or salmon, was, that in the massier\r\n_slates_, the sides, or _cover_,--nicely bevelled, in order to preserve\r\nan equability of thickness throughout,--were so adjusted, that two\r\nscales at their edges, where they lay the one over the other, were not\r\nthicker than one scale at its centre. Even in the other ganoids, their\r\ncontemporaries, such as the Osteolepis and Diplopterus, where the\r\nscales were ranged more in the tile fashion, side by side, there was,\r\nwith much ingenious carpentry in the fitting, a general simplicity of\r\nform. It would almost appear, however, that ere the ganoid order reached\r\nthe times of the Weald, the simple forms had been exhausted, and that\r\nnature, abhorring repetition, and ever stamping upon the scales some\r\nspecific characteristic of the creature that bore them, was obliged to\r\nhave recourse to forms of a more complex and involved outline. These\r\nlatter-day scales send out nail-like spikes laterally and atop, to lay\r\nhold upon their neighbors, and exhibit in their undersides grooves that\r\naccommodated the nails sent out, in turn, by their neighbors, to lay\r\nhold upon _them_. Their forms, too, are indescribably various and\r\nfantastic. It seems curious enough, that immediately after this\r\nextremely _artificial_ state of things, if I may so speak, the two\r\nprevailing orders of the fish of the present day, the Cycloids and\r\nCtenoids, should have been ushered upon the scene, and more than the\r\noriginal simplicity of scale restored. There took place a sudden\r\nreaction, from the fantastic and the complex to the simple and the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nIt is further worthy of notice, that though many of the ganoid scales of\r\nthe Secondary systems, including those of the Wealden, glitter as\r\nbrightly in burnished enamel as the more splendent scales of the Old Red\r\nSandstone and Coal Measures, there is a curious peculiarity exhibited in\r\nthe structure of many of the older scales of the highly enamelled class,\r\nwhich, so far as I have yet seen, does not extend beyond the Palaeozoic\r\nperiod. The outer layer of the scale, which lies over a middle layer of\r\na cellular cancellated structure, and corresponds, apparently, with that\r\nscarf-skin which in the human subject overlies the _rete mucosum_, is\r\nthickly set over with microscopic pores, funnel-shaped in the transverse\r\nsection, and which, examined by a good glass, in the horizontal one\r\nresemble the puncturings of a sieve. The Megalichthys of the Coal\r\nMeasures, with its various carboniferous congeners, with the genera\r\nDiplopterus, Dipterus, and Osteolepis of the Old Red Sandstone,--all\r\nbrilliantly enamelled fish,--are thickly pore-covered. But whatever\r\npurpose these pores may have served, it seems in the Secondary period to\r\nhave been otherwise accomplished, if, indeed, it continued to exist. It\r\nis a curious circumstance, that in no case do the pores seem to pass\r\n_through_ the scale. Whatever their use, they existed merely as\r\ncommunications between the cells of the middle cancellated layer and the\r\nsurface. In a fish of the Chalk,--_Macropoma Mantelli_,--the exposed\r\nfields of the scales are covered over with apparently hollow, elongated\r\ncylinders, as the little tubes in a shower-bath cover their round field\r\nof tin, save that they lie in a greatly flatter angle than the tubes;\r\nbut I know not that, like the pores of the Dipterians and the\r\nMegalichthys, they communicated between the interior of the scale and\r\nits external surface. Their structure is at any rate palpably different,\r\nand they bear no such resemblance to the pores of the human skin as that\r\nwhich the Palaeozoic pores present.\r\n\r\nThe amount of design exhibited in the scales of some of the more ancient\r\nganoids,--design obvious enough to be clearly read,--is very\r\nextraordinary. A single scale of _Holoptychius Nobilissimus_,--fast\r\nlocked up in its red sandstone rock,--laid by, as it were, for\r\never,--will be seen, if we but set ourselves to unravel its texture, to\r\nform such an instance of nice adaptation of means to an end as might of\r\nitself be sufficient to confound the atheist. Let me attempt placing one\r\nof these scales before the reader, in its character as a flat counter of\r\nbone, of a nearly circular form, an inch and a half in diameter, and an\r\neighth-part of an inch in thickness; and then ask him to bethink\r\nhimself of the various means by which he would impart to it the greatest\r\npossible degree of strength. The human skull consists of two tables of\r\nsolid bone, an inner and an outer, with a spongy cellular substance\r\ninterposed between them, termed the _diploe_; and such is the effect of\r\nthis arrangement, that the blow which would fracture a continuous wall\r\nof bone has its force broken by the spongy intermediate layer, and\r\nmerely injures the outer table, leaving not unfrequently the inner one,\r\nwhich more especially protects the brain, wholly unharmed. Now, such\r\nalso was the arrangement in the scale of the _Holoptychius\r\nNobilissimus_. It consisted of its two well-marked tables of solid bone,\r\ncorresponding in their dermal character, the outer to the cuticle, the\r\ninner to the true skin, and the intermediate cellular layer to the _rete\r\nmucosum_; but bearing an unmistakable analogy also, as a mechanical\r\ncontrivance, to the two plates and the _diploe_ of the human skull. To\r\nthe strengthening principle of the two tables, however, there were two\r\nother principles added. Cromwell, when commissioning for a new helmet,\r\nhis old one being, as he expresses it, \"ill set,\" ordered his friend to\r\nsend him a \"_fluted pot_,\" _i.e._, a helmet ridged and furrowed on the\r\nsurface, and suited to break, by its protuberant lines, the force of a\r\nblow, so that the vibrations of the stroke would reach the body of the\r\nmetal deadened and flat. Now, the outer table of the scale of the\r\nHoloptychius was a \"fluted pot.\" The alternate ridges and furrows which\r\nornamented its surface served a purpose exactly similar with that of the\r\nflutes and fillets of Cromwell's helmet. The inner table was\r\nstrengthened on a different but not less effective principle. The human\r\nstomach consists of three coats; and two of these, the outermost or\r\nperitoneal coat, and the middle or muscular coat, are so arranged, that\r\nthe fibres of the one cross at nearly right angles those of the other.\r\nThe violence which would tear the compact sides of this important organ\r\nalong the fibres of the outer coat, would be checked by the transverse\r\narrangement of the fibres of the middle coat, and _vice versa_. We find\r\nthe cotton manufacturer weaving some of his stronger fabrics on a\r\nsimilar plan;--they also are made to consist of two _coats_; and what is\r\ntechnically termed the _tear_ of the upper is so disposed that it lies\r\nat an angle of forty-five degrees with the _tear_ of the coat which lies\r\nunderneath. Now, the inner table of the scale of the Holoptychius was\r\ncomposed, on this principle, of various layers or coats, arranged the\r\none over the other, so that the fibres of each lay at right angles\r\nwith the fibres of the others in immediate contact with it. In\r\nthe inner table of one scale I reckon nine of these alternating,\r\nvariously-disposed layers; so that any application of violence, which,\r\nin the language of the lath-splitter, would _run lengthwise along the\r\ngrain_ of four of them, would be checked by the _cross grain_ in five.\r\nIn other words, the line of the _tear_ in five of the layers was ranged\r\nat right angles with the line of the _tear_ in four. There were thus in\r\na single scale, in order to secure the greatest possible amount of\r\nstrength,--and who can say what other purposes may have been secured\r\nbesides?--three distinct principles embodied,--the principle of the two\r\ntables and _diploe_ of the human skull,--the principle of the variously\r\narranged coats of the human stomach,--and the principle of Oliver\r\nCromwell's \"fluted pot.\" There have been elaborate treatises written on\r\nthose ornate flooring-tiles of the classical and middle ages, that are\r\noccasionally dug up by the antiquary amid monastic ruins, or on the\r\nsites of old Roman stations. But did any of them ever tell a story half\r\nso instructive or so strange as that told by the incalculably more\r\nancient ganoid _tiles_ of the Palaeozoic and Secondary periods?\r\n\r\nI called, on my way back from Linksfield, upon my old friend Mr. Patrick\r\nDuff, and was introduced once more to his exquisite collection, with its\r\nunique ichthyolites of at least two genera of fishes of the Old\r\nRed,--the _Stagonolepis_ and _Placothorax_ of Agassiz,--which up to the\r\npresent time are to be seen nowhere else; and various other fine\r\nspecimens of rare species, which, having sat for their portraits, have\r\ntheir forms preserved in the great work of the naturalist of Neufchatel.\r\nHe showed me, with some triumph, one of his later acquisitions,--a fine\r\nspecimen of Holoptychius from the upper yellow sandstone of Bishop-Mill,\r\nwhich exhibits the dorsal ridge covered with a line of large overlapping\r\nscales, not at all unlike those overlapping plates which cover the tail\r\nof the lobster; for which, by the way, they were mistaken by the workman\r\nwho first laid the fossil open. I examined, too, with some interest,\r\nfragments of a gigantic species of Pterichthys, belonging to an inferior\r\ndivision of the same Upper Old Red formation as the yellow stone,\r\ndesignated by Agassiz _Pterichthys major_, which must have attained to\r\nat least thrice the size, linearly, of even its bulkier congeners of the\r\nLower formation of the Coccosteus. After examining many a drawer,\r\nstored, from the deposits of the neighborhood, with characteristic\r\nfossils of the Lias, the Weald, and the Oolite, and of the Upper and\r\nLower Old Red, we set out together to expatiate amid the treasures of\r\nthe Town Museum.\r\n\r\nAmong other recent additions to the Museum, there is an interesting set\r\nof the fishes of the Ganges, the donation of a gentleman long resident\r\nin India, to which Mr. Duff called my attention, as illustrative, in\r\nsome of the specimens, of the more characteristic ichthyolites of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone. One numerous family, the Pimelodi, abundantly\r\nrepresented in the Gangetic region, in not only the rivers, but also the\r\nponds, tanks, and estuaries of the district, is certainly worthy the\r\ncareful study of the geologist. It approaches nearer, in some of its\r\nmore strongly-marked genera, to the Coccosteus of the Lower Old Red,\r\nthan any other tribe of existing fishes which I have yet seen. The body\r\nof the Pimelodus, from the anterior dorsal downwards, is as naked as\r\nthat of the eel; whereas the head, and in several of the species the\r\nback, is armed with strong plates of naked bone, curiously fretted, as\r\nin many of the ichthyolites of the Lower, and more especially of the\r\nUpper Old Red Sandstone, into ridges of confluent tubercles, that\r\nradiate from the centre to the edges of the plates. The dorsal plate,\r\ntoo, when detached, as in many of the species, from the plates of the\r\nhead, bears upon its inner side a strong central ridge, that deepens as\r\nit descends, till it abruptly terminates a little short of the\r\ntermination of the plate, exactly as in the dorsal plate of Coccosteus,\r\nwhich sunk its central ridge deep into the back of the animal. The point\r\nof resemblance to be mainly noticed, however, is the contrast furnished\r\nby the powerful armature of the head and back, with the unprotected\r\nnakedness of the posterior portions of the creature;--a point specially\r\nnoticeable in the Coccosteus, and apparent also, though in a lesser\r\ndegree, in some of the other genera of the Old Red, such as the\r\nPterichthyes and Asterolepides. From the snout of the Coccosteus down to\r\nthe posterior termination of the dorsal plate, the creature was cased in\r\nstrong armor, the plates of which remain as freshly preserved in the\r\nancient rocks of the country as those of the Pimelodi of the Ganges on\r\nthe shelves of the Elgin Museum; but from the pointed termination of the\r\nplate immediately over the dorsal fin, to the tail, comprising more\r\nthan one half the entire length of the animal, all seems to have been\r\nexposed, without the protection of even a scale, and there survives in\r\nthe better specimens only the internal skeleton of the fish and the\r\nray-bones of the fins. It was armed, like a French dragoon, with a\r\nstrong helmet and a short cuirass; and so we find its remains in the\r\nstate in which those of some of the soldiers of Napoleon's old guard,\r\nthat had been committed unstripped to the earth, may be dug up in the\r\nfuture on the fatal field of Borodino, or along the banks of the Dwina\r\nor the Wap. The cuirass lies still attached to the helmet, but we find\r\nonly the naked skeleton attached to the cuirass. The Pterichthys to its\r\nstrong helmet and cuirass added a posterior armature of comparatively\r\nfeeble scales, as if, while its upper parts were shielded with plate\r\narmor, a lighter covering of ring or scale armor sufficed for the less\r\nvital parts beneath. In the Asterolepis the arrangement was somewhat\r\nsimilar, save that the plated cuirass was wanting: it was a strongly\r\nhelmed warrior in slight scale armor; for the disproportion between the\r\nstrength of the plated head-piece and that of the scaly coat was still\r\ngreater than in the Pterichthys. The occipital star-covered plates are,\r\nin some of the larger specimens, fully three-quarters of an inch in\r\nthickness, whereas the thickness of the delicately-fretted scales rarely\r\nexceeds a line.\r\n\r\nWhy this disproportion between the strength of the armature in different\r\nparts of the same fish should have obtained, as in Pterichthys and\r\nAsterolepis, or why, while one portion of the animal was strongly armed,\r\nanother portion should have been left, as in Coccosteus, wholly exposed,\r\ncannot of course be determined by the mere geologist. His rocks present\r\nhim with but the fact of the disproportion, without accounting for it.\r\nBut the natural history of existing fish, in which, as in the Pimelodi,\r\nthere may be detected a similar peculiarity of armature, may perhaps\r\nthrow some light on the mystery. In Hamilton's \"Fishes of the Ganges\" I\r\nfind but little reference made to the instincts and habits of the\r\nanimals described: their deep-river haunts lie, in many cases, beyond\r\nthe reach of observation; and of the observations actually made, the\r\ndescriptive naturalist, intent often on mere peculiarities of structure,\r\nis not unfrequently too careless. Hamilton describes the habitats of the\r\nvarious Indian species of Pimelodi, whether brackish estuaries, ponds,\r\nor rivers, but not their characteristic instincts. Of the Silurus,\r\nhowever, a genus of the same great family, I read elsewhere that some of\r\nthe species, such as the _Silurus glanis_, being unwieldy in their\r\nmotions, do not pursue their prey, which consists of small fishes, but\r\nlie concealed among the mud, and seize on the chance stragglers that\r\ncome their way. And of the _Pimelodus gulio_, a little, strongly-helmed\r\nfish, with a naked body, I was informed by Mr. Duff, on the authority of\r\nthe gentleman who had presented the specimens to the Museum, that it\r\nburrowed in the holes of muddy banks, from which it shot out its armed\r\nhead, and arrested, as they passed, the minute animals on which it\r\npreyed. The animal world is full of such compensatory defences: there is\r\na half-suit of armor given to shield half the body, and a wise instinct\r\nto protect the rest. The _Pholas crispata_ cannot shut its valves so as\r\nto protect its anterior parts, without raising them from off those parts\r\nwhich lie behind: like the Irishman in the haunted house, who attempted\r\nlengthening his blanket by cutting strips from the top and sewing them\r\non to the bottom, it loses at the one end what it gains at the other;\r\nbut, hemmed round by the solid walls of the recess which it is its\r\nnature to hollow out for itself in shale or stone, the anterior parts,\r\nthough uncovered by the shell, are not exposed. By closing its valves\r\nanteriorly, it shuts the door of its little house, made like that of the\r\nconey-folk of Scripture, in the rock; and then, of the entire cell in\r\nwhich it dwells so secure, what is not shut door is impregnable wall.\r\nThe remark of Paley, that the \"human animal is the only one which is\r\nnaked, and the only one which can clothe itself,\" is by no means quite\r\ncorrect. One half the hermit crab is as naked as the \"human animal,\" and\r\neven less fitted for exposure; for it consists of a thin-skinned, soft,\r\nunmuscular bag, filled with delicate viscera; but not even the human\r\nanimal is more skilful in clothing himself in the spoils of other\r\nanimals than the hermit crab in wrapping up its naked bag in the strong\r\nshell of some dead fusus or buccinum, which it carries about with it in\r\nall its peregrinations, as at once clothes, armor, and house. Nature\r\narms its front, and it is itself wise enough to arm its rear. Now, it\r\nseems not improbable that the half-armed Coccosteus, a heavy fish,\r\nindifferently furnished with fins, may have burrowed, like the recent\r\n_Silurus glanis_ or _Pimelodus gulio_, in a thick mud,--of the existence\r\nof which in vast quantity, during the times of the Old Red Sandstone,\r\nthe dark Caithness flagstones, the fetid breccia of Strathpeffer, and\r\nthe gray stratified clays of Cromarty, Moray, and Banff, unequivocally\r\ntestify; and that it may have thus not only succeeded in capturing many\r\nof its light-winged contemporaries, which it would have vainly pursued\r\nin open sea, but may have been enabled also to present to its enemies,\r\nwhen assailed in turn, only its armed portions, and to protect its\r\nunarmed parts in its burrow. It is further worthy of notice, that many\r\nof the Pimelodi are furnished with spines, not, like those\r\nichthyodorulites which occur so frequently in the older Secondary and\r\nPalaeozoic divisions, unfinished in appearance at their lower extremity,\r\nas if, like the spines of the ancient Acanthodi, or those of the recent\r\ndog-fish (_Spinax acanthias_), they had been simply embedded in the\r\nflesh, but bearing, like the wings of the Pterichthys, an articulated\r\naspect. Those of the _Pimelodus rita_ and _Pimelodus gagata_ are of\r\nsingular beauty; and when the creatures have no further use for them,\r\nand the mud of the Ganges has been consolidated into shale or baked into\r\nflagstone around them, they will make very exquisite fossils. A correct\r\ndrawing of the plates and spines of some of the members of the Pimelodi\r\nfamily, with a portion of the internal skeletons, arranged in their\r\nproper places, but divested of those more destructible parts to which\r\nthey are attached, would serve admirably to show what strange forms fish\r\nnot greatly removed from the ordinary type may assume in the fossil\r\nstate, and might throw some light on the extraordinary appearance\r\nassumed, as ichthyolites, by the old family of the Cephalaspians.\r\n\r\nThe geological department of the Elgin Museum is not yet very complete.\r\nThe private collections of the locality, by forestalling, greatly\r\nrestrict the supply from the rich deposits in the neighborhood, and have\r\nan unquestioned right to do so. The Museum contains, however, several\r\ninteresting organisms. I saw, among the others, a specimen of\r\nDiplopterus, that showed the form and position of the fins of this\r\nrather rare ichthyolite much better than any of the Morayshire specimens\r\nportrayed by Agassiz in his great work; and beside it, one of the two\r\nspecimens of _Pterichthys oblongus_ which he figures, and on which he\r\nestablishes the species. The other individual,--a Cromarty\r\nspecimen,--graces my little collection. The gloomy day passed pleasantly\r\nin deciphering, with so accomplished a geologist as Mr. Duff, these\r\ncurious hieroglyphics of the old world, that tell such wonderful\r\nstories, and in comparing _viva voce_, as we were wont to do long years\r\nbefore in lengthy epistles, our respective notions regarding the true\r\nkey for laying open their more occult meanings. And, after sharing with\r\nhim in his family dinner, I again took my seat on the mail, as a chill,\r\nraw evening was falling, and rode on, some six or eight and twenty\r\nmiles, to Campbelton. The rain pattered drearily through the night on my\r\nbed-room window; and as frequent exposure to the wet had begun to tell\r\non a constitution not altogether so strong as it had once been, I\r\nawakened oftener than was quite comfortable, to hear it. The morning,\r\nhowever, was dry, though gray and sunless; and, taking an early\r\nbreakfast at the inn, I traversed the flat gravelly points of Ardersier\r\nand Fortrose, that, projecting like moles far into the Frith, narrow the\r\nintervening ferry to considerably less than one-third the width which it\r\nwould present were they away. The origin of these long detrital\r\npromontories, which form, when viewed from the heights on either side,\r\nso peculiar a feature in the landscape, and which, were they directly\r\nopposite, instead of being set down a mile awry, would shut up the\r\nopening altogether, has not yet been satisfactorily accounted for. One\r\nspecial theory assigns their formation to the agency of the descending\r\ntide, striking in zig-gig style, in consequence of some peculiarity of\r\nthe coast-line or of the bottom, from side to side of the Frith, and\r\ndepositing a long trail of sand and gravel, at nearly right angles with\r\nthe beach, first on the one shore and then on the other. But why the\r\ntide, which runs in various zig-zag crossings in the course of the\r\nFrith, should have the effect here, and nowhere else, of raising two\r\nvast mounds, each a full mile and a quarter in length, with an average\r\nbreadth of from two to five furlongs, is by no means very apparent.\r\nCertainly the present tides of the Frith could not have formed them, nor\r\ncould they have been elevated to their present average height of ten or\r\ntwelve feet over the flood-line in a sea standing at the existing level.\r\nIf they in reality originated in this cause, it must have been ere the\r\nlatter upheavals of the land or recessions of the sea, when the great\r\nCaledonian Valley existed as a narrow ocean sound, swept by powerful\r\ncurrents. Upon another and entirely different hypothesis, these flat\r\npromontories have been regarded as the remains, levelled by the waves,\r\nand gapped direct in the middle by the tide, of a vast transverse morain\r\nof the great valley, belonging to the same glacial age as the lateral\r\nmorains some ten or fifteen miles higher up, that extend from the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of Inverness to the mansion-house of Dochfour.\r\nBut this hypothesis, like the other, is not without its difficulties.\r\nWhy, for instance, should the promontories be a mile awry? There is,\r\nhowever, yet another mode of accounting for their formation, which I am\r\nnot in the least disposed to criticise.\r\n\r\nThey were constructed, says tradition, through the agency of the\r\narch-wizard Michael Scott. Michael had called up the hosts of Faery to\r\nerect the cathedral of Elgin and the chanonry kirk of Fortrose, which\r\nthey completed from foundation to ridge, each in a single\r\nnight,--committing, in their hurry, merely the slight mistake of\r\nlocating the building intended for Elgin in Fortrose, and that intended\r\nfor Fortrose in Elgin; but, their work over and done, and when the\r\nmagician had no further use for them, they absolutely refused to be\r\n_laid_; and, like a _posse_ of Irish laborers thrown out of a job, came\r\nthronging round him, clamoring for more employment. Fearing lest he\r\nshould be torn in pieces,--a catastrophe which has not unfrequently\r\nhappened in such circumstances in the olden time, and of which those\r\nrecent philanthropists who engage themselves in finding work for the\r\nunemployed may have perhaps entertained some little dread in our own\r\ndays,--he got rid of them for the time by setting them off in a body to\r\nrun a mound across the Moray Frith from Fortrose to Ardersier. Toiling\r\nhard in the evening of a moonlight night, they had proceeded greatly\r\nmore than two-thirds towards the completion of the undertaking, when a\r\nluckless Highlander passing by bade God-speed the work, and, by thus\r\nbreaking the charm, arrested at once and forever the construction of the\r\nmound, and saved the navigation of Inverness.\r\n\r\nI stood for a few seconds at the Burn of Rosemarkie undecided whether I\r\nshould take the Scarfs-Craig road,--a break-neck path which runs\r\neastwards along the cliffs, and which, though the rougher, is the more\r\ndirect Cromarty line of the two,--or the considerably better though\r\nlonger line of the White Bog, which strikes upwards along the burn in a\r\nwesterly direction, and joins the Cromarty and Inverness highway on the\r\nmoor of the Maolbuie. I had got into a part of the country where every\r\nlittle locality, and every more striking feature in the landscape, has\r\nits associated tradition; and the pause of a few moments at the two\r\nroads recalled to my memory the details of a ghost-story, long regarded\r\nin the district in which it was best known as one of the most authentic\r\nof its class, but which seems by no means inexplicable on natural\r\nprinciples.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     Rosemarkie and its Scaurs--Kaes' Craig--A Jackdaw\r\n     Settlement--\"Rosemarkie Kaes\" and \"Cromarty Cooties\"--\"The Danes,\"\r\n     a Group of Excavations--At Home in Cromarty--The Boulder-clay of\r\n     Cromarty \"begins to tell its story\"--One of its marked Scenic\r\n     Peculiarities--Hints to Landscape Painters--\"Samuel's Well\"--A\r\n     Chain of Bogs geologically accounted for--Another Scenic\r\n     Peculiarity--\"_Ha-has_ of Nature's digging\"--The Author's earliest\r\n     Field of Hard Labor--Picturesque Cliff of Boulder-clay--Scratchings\r\n     on the Sandstone--Invariable Characteristic of true\r\n     Boulder-clay--Scratchings on Pebbles in the line of the longer\r\n     axis--Illustration from the Boulder-clay of Banff.\r\n\r\n\r\nRosemarkie, with its long narrow valley and its red abrupt _scaurs_,[14]\r\nis chiefly interesting to the geologist for its vast beds of the\r\nboulder-clay. I am acquainted with no other locality in the kingdom\r\nwhere this deposit is hollowed into ravines so profound, or presents\r\nprecipices so imposing and lofty. The clay lies thickly over most part\r\nof the Black Isle and the peninsula of Easter Ross,--both soft sandstone\r\ndistricts,--bearing everywhere an obvious relation, as a deposit, to\r\nboth the form and the conditions of exposure of the existing land,--just\r\nas the accumulated snow of a long-lying snow-storm, exposed to the\r\ndrifting wind, bears relation to the heights and hollows of the tracts\r\nwhich it covers. On the higher eminences the clay forms a comparatively\r\nthin stratum, and in not a few instances it has been wholly worn away;\r\nwhile on the lower grounds, immediately over the old coast line, and in\r\nthe sides of hollow valleys,--exactly such places as we might expect to\r\nsee the snow occupying most deeply after a night of drift,--we find it\r\naccumulated in vast beds of from eighty to an hundred feet in thickness.\r\nOne of these occurs in the opening of the narrow valley along which my\r\ncourse this morning lay, and is known far and wide,--for it forms a\r\nmarked feature in the landscape, and harbors in its recesses a countless\r\nmultitude of jackdaws,--as the \"Kaes' Craig of Rosemarkie.\" It presents\r\nthe appearance of a hill that had been cut sheer through the middle from\r\ntop to base, and exhibits in its abrupt front a broad red perpendicular\r\nsection of at least a hundred feet in height, barred transversely by\r\nthin layers of sand, and scored vertically by the slow action of the\r\nrains. Originally it must have stretched its vanished limb across the\r\nopening like some huge snow-wreath accumulated athwart a frozen rivulet;\r\nbut the incessant sweep of the stream that runs through the valley has\r\nlong since amputated and carried it away; and so only half the hill now\r\nremains. The Kaes' Craig resembles in form a lofty chalk cliff, square,\r\nmassy, abrupt, with no sloping fillet of vegetation bound across its\r\nbrow, but precipitous direct from the hill-top. The little ancient\r\nvillage of Rosemarkie stretches away from its base on the opposite side\r\nof the stream; and on its summit and along its sides, groups of\r\nchattering jackdaws, each one of them as reflective and philosophic as\r\nthe individual immortalized by Cowper, look down high over the chimneys\r\ninto the streets. The clay presents here, more than in almost any other\r\nlocality with which I am acquainted, the character of a stratified\r\ndeposit; and the numerous bands of sand by which the cliff is\r\nhorizontally streaked from top to bottom we find hollowed, as we\r\napproach, into a multitude of circular openings, like shot-holes in an\r\nold tower, which form breeding-places for the daw and the sand-martin.\r\nThe biped inhabitants of the cliff are greatly more numerous than the\r\nbiped inhabitants of the quiet little hamlet below; and on Fortrose\r\nfair-days, when, in virtue of an old feud, the Rosemarkie boys were wont\r\nto engage in formidable bickers with the boys of Cromarty, I remember,\r\nas one of the invading belligerents, that, in bandying names with them\r\nin the fray, we delighted to bestow upon them, as their hereditary\r\nsobriquet, given, of course, in allusion to their feathered neighbors,\r\nthe designation of the \"_Rosemarkie kaes_.\" Cromarty, however, is\r\ntwo-thirds surrounded by the waters of a frith abounding in sea-fowl;\r\nand the little fellows of Rosemarkie, indignant at being classed with\r\ntheir _kaes_, used to designate us with hearty emphasis, in turn, as the\r\n\"_Cromarty cooties_,\" _i.e._, coots.\r\n\r\nA little higher up the valley, on the western side, there occurs in the\r\nclay what may be termed a _group_ of excavations, composing a piece of\r\nscenery ruinously broken and dreary, and that bears a specific character\r\nof its own which scarce any other deposit could have exhibited. The\r\nexcavations are of considerable depth and extent,--hollows out of which\r\nthe materials of pyramids might have been taken. The precipitous sides\r\nare fretted by jutting ridges and receding inflections, that present in\r\nabundance their diversified alternations of light and shadow. The steep\r\ndescents form cycloid curves, that flatten at their bases, and over\r\nwhich the ferruginous stratum of mould atop projects like a cornice.\r\nBetween neighboring excavations there stand up dividing walls, tall and\r\nthin as those of our city buildings, and in some cases broken at their\r\nupper edges into rows of sharp pinnacles or inaccessible turf-coped\r\nturrets; while at the bottom of the hollows, washed by the runnels\r\nwhich, in the slow lapse of years, have been the architects of the\r\nwhole, we find cairn-like accumulations of water-rolled stones,--the\r\ndisengaged pebbles and boulders of the deposit. The boulders and pebbles\r\nproject also from the steep sides, at all heights and of all sizes,\r\nlike the primary masses inclosed in our ancient conglomerates, when\r\nexhibited in wave-worn precipices,--forcing upon the mind the conclusion\r\nthat the boulder-clay is itself but an unconsolidated conglomerate of\r\nthe later periods, which occupies nearly the same relative position to\r\nthe existing vegetable mould, with all its recent productions, that the\r\ngreat conglomerate of the Old Red Sandstone occupies in relation to the\r\nlower ichthyolite beds of that system, with their numerous extinct\r\norganisms. But its buried stones are fretted with hieroglyphic\r\ninscriptions, in the form of strange scratchings and polishings,\r\ngrooves, ridges, and furrows,--always associated with the\r\nboulder-clays,--which those of the more ancient conglomerates want, and\r\nwhich, though difficult to read, seem at length to be yielding up the\r\nstory which they record. Of this, however, more anon. Viewed by\r\nmoonlight, when the pale red of the clay where the beam falls direct is\r\nrelieved by the intense shadows, these excavations of the valley of\r\nRosemarkie form scenes of strange and ghostly wildness: the projecting,\r\nbuttress-like angles,--the broken walls,--the curved inflections,--the\r\npointed pinnacles,--the turrets, with their masses of projecting\r\ncoping,--the utter lack of vegetation, save where the heath and the\r\nfurze rustle far above,--all combine to form assemblages of dreary\r\nruins, amid which, in the solitude of night, one almost expects to see\r\nspirits walk. These excavations have been designated, from time\r\nimmemorial, by the neighboring town's-people, as \"the Danes;\" but\r\nwhether the name be, as is most probable, merely a corruption of an\r\nappropriate enough Saxon word, \"the dens,\" or derived, as a vague\r\ntradition is said to testify, from the ages of Danish invasion, it is\r\nnot quite the part of the geologist to determine. It may be worth\r\nmentioning, however, from its bearing on the point, that there are two\r\nexcavations in the boulder-clay near Cromarty, one of which has been\r\nlong known by the name of \"the Morial's Den,\" while the other, greatly\r\nsmaller in size, rejoices in the double diminutive of \"the Little\r\nDennie.\" For an hour or so the Danes proved agreeable though somewhat\r\nsilent companions; and then, climbing the opposite side of the valley, I\r\ngained the high road, and, walking on to Cromarty, found myself once\r\nmore among \"the old familiar faces.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few days the storm blew by; and as the prolonged rains had cleared\r\nout the deep ravines of the district, and given to the boulder-clay in\r\nwhich they are scooped a freshness in its section analogous to fresh\r\nfracture in rocks of harder consistency, I availed myself of the\r\nfacilities afforded me in consequence, for exploring it once more. It\r\nhas long constituted one of the hardest of the many riddles with which\r\nour Scottish deposits exercise the patience and ingenuity of the\r\ngeologist. I remember a time when, after passing a day under its barren\r\n_scaurs_, or hid in its precipitous ravines, I used to feel in the\r\nevening as if I had been travelling under the cloud of night, and had\r\nseen nothing. It was a morose and taciturn companion, and had no\r\nspeculation in it. I might stand in front of its curved precipices, red,\r\nyellow or gray, according to the prevailing average color of the rocks\r\non which it rests, and mark their water-rolled boulders, of all\r\nqualities and sizes, sticking out in bold relief from the surface, like\r\nthe rock-like protuberances that roughen the rustic basements of the\r\narchitect, from the line of the wall; but I had no _open sesame_ to form\r\nvistas through them into the recesses of the past. I saw merely the\r\nstiff pastry matrix of which they are composed, and the inclosed\r\npebbles. But the boulder-clay has of late become more sociable; and,\r\nthough with much hesitancy and irresolution, like old Mr. Spectator on\r\nthe first formal opening of his mouth,--a consequence, doubtless, in\r\nboth cases of previous habits of silence long indulged,--it begins to\r\ntell its story. And a most curious story it is.\r\n\r\nThe morning was clear, but just a little chill; and a soft covering of\r\nsnow, that had fallen during the storm on the flat summit of Ben-Wevis,\r\nand showed its extreme tenuity by the paleness of its tint of watery\r\nblue, was still distinctly visible at the distance of full twenty miles.\r\nThe sun, low in the sky,--for the hour was early,--cast its slant rays\r\nathwart the prospect, giving to each nearer bank and hillock, and to the\r\nmore distant protuberances on the mountain-sides, those well-defined\r\naccompaniments of shadow that serve by throwing the minor features of a\r\nlandscape upon the eye in bold relief, to impart to it an air of higher\r\nfinish and more careful filling up than it ever bears under a more\r\nvertical light. I took the road which, leading westward from the town\r\ntowards Invergordon Ferry, skirts the Frith on the one hand, and runs\r\nimmediately under the noble escarpment of green bank formed by the old\r\ncoast line on the other. Fully two-thirds of the entire height of the\r\nrampart here, which rises in all about a hundred feet over the\r\nsea-level, is formed of the boulder-clay; and I am acquainted with no\r\nlocality in which the deposit presents more strongly, for at least the\r\nfirst half mile, one of its marked scenic peculiarities. It is furrowed\r\nvertically on the slope, as if by enormous flutings in the more antique\r\nDoric style; and the ridges by which these are separated,--each from a\r\nhundred to a hundred and fifty feet in length, and from five-and-twenty\r\nto thirty feet in average height,--resemble those burial mounds with\r\nwhich the sexton frets the churchyard turf; with this difference,\r\nhowever, that they seem the burial mounds of giants, tall and bulky as\r\nthose that of old warred against the gods. They are striking enough to\r\nhave caught the eye of the children of the place, and are known among\r\nthem as the Giants' Graves. I could fain have taken their portrait in a\r\ncalotype this morning, as they lay against the green bank,--their feet\r\nto the shore, and their heads on the top of the escarpment,--like\r\npatients on a reclining bed, and strongly marked, each by its broad bar\r\nof yellow light and of dark shadow, like the ebon and ivory buttresses\r\nof the poet. This little vignette, I would have said to the landscape\r\npainter, represents the boulder-clay, after its precipitous banks--worn\r\ndown, by the frosts and rains of centuries, into parallel runnels, that\r\ngradually widened into these hollow grooves--had sunk into the angle of\r\ninclination at which the disintegrating agents ceased to operate, and\r\nthe green sward covered all up. You must be studying these peculiarities\r\nof aspect more than ever you studied them before. There is a time coming\r\nwhen the connoisseur will as rigidly demand the specific character of\r\nthe various geologic rocks and deposits in your hills, _scaurs_, and\r\nprecipices, as he now demands specific character in your shrubs and\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy the notice of the young geologist, who has just set himself\r\nto study the various effects produced on the surface of a country by the\r\ndeposits which lie under it, that for about a quarter of a mile or so,\r\nthe base of the escarpment here is bordered by a line of bogs, that bear\r\nin the driest weather their mantling of green. They are fed with a\r\nperennial supply of water, by a range of deep-seated springs, that come\r\nbursting out from under the boulder-clay; and one of their number, which\r\nbears I know not why, the name of Samuel's Well, and yields its equable\r\nflow at an equable temperature, summer and winter, into a stone trough\r\nby the way-side, is not a little prized by the town's-people, and the\r\nseamen that cast anchor in the opposite roadstead, for the lightness and\r\npurity of its water. What is specially worthy of notice in the case is,\r\nthe very definite beginning and ending of the chain of bogs. All is dry\r\nat the base of the escarpment, up to the point at which they commence;\r\nand then all is equally dry at the point at which they terminate. And of\r\nexactly the same extent,--beginning where the bogs begin, and ending\r\nwhere they end,--we may trace an ancient stratum of pure sand,--of\r\nconsiderable thickness, intercalated between the base of the clay and\r\nthe superior surface of the Old Red Sandstone. It is through this\r\npermeable sand that the profoundly seated springs find their way to the\r\nsurface,--for the clay is impermeable; and where it comes in contact\r\nwith the rock on either side of the arenaceous stratum, the bogs cease.\r\nThe chain of green bogs is a consequence of the stratum of permeable\r\nsand. I have in vain sought this ancient layer of sand,--decidedly of\r\nthe same era with the argillaceous bed which overlies it,--for aught\r\norganic. A single shell, so unequivocally of the period of the\r\nboulder-clay as to occur at the base of the deposit, would be worth, I\r\nhave said, whole drawerfuls of fossils furnished by the better-known\r\ndeposits. But I have since seen in abundance shells of the boulder-clay.\r\n\r\nThere is another scenic peculiarity of the clay, which the neighborhood\r\nof Cromarty finely illustrates, and of which my walk this morning\r\nfurnished numerous striking instances. The Giants' Graves--to borrow\r\nfrom the children of the place--occur on the steep slopes of the old\r\ncoast line, or in the sides of ravines, where the clay, as I have said,\r\nhad once presented a precipitous front, but had been gradually moulded,\r\nunder the attritive influences of the elements, into series of\r\nalternating ridges and furrows, which, when they had flattened into the\r\nproper angle, the green sward covered up from further waste. But the\r\ndeep dells and narrow ravines in which many ranges of these graves occur\r\nare themselves peculiarities of the deposit. Wherever the boulder-clay\r\nlies thick and continuous, as in the parish of Cromarty, on a sloping\r\ntable-land, every minute streamlet cuts its way to the solid rock at the\r\nbottom, and runs through a deep dell, either softened into beauty by the\r\ndisintegrating process, or with all its precipices standing up raw and\r\nabrupt over the stream. Four of these ravines, known as the \"Old Chapel\r\nBurn,\" the \"Ladies' Walk,\" the \"Morial's Den,\" and the \"Red Burn,\" each\r\nof them cutting the escarpment of the ancient coast line from top to\r\nbase, and winding far into the interior, occur in little more than a\r\nmile's space; and they lie still more thickly farther to the west. These\r\ndells of the boulder clay, in their lower windings,--for they become\r\nshallower and tamer as they ascend, till they terminate in the uplands\r\nin mere _drains_, such as a ditcher might excavate at the rate of a\r\nshilling or two per yard,--are eminently picturesque. On those gentler\r\nslopes where the vegetable mould has had time and space to accumulate,\r\nwe find not a few of the finest and tallest trees of the district. There\r\nis a bosky luxuriance in their more sheltered hollows, well known to the\r\nschoolboy what time the fern begins to pale its fronds, for their store\r\nof hips, sloes, and brambles; and red over the foliage we may see, ever\r\nand anon as we wend upwards, the abrupt frontage of some precipitous\r\n_scaur_, suited to remind the geologist, from its square form and flat\r\nbreadth of surface, of the cliffs of the chalk. When viewed from the\r\nsea, at the distance of a few miles, these ravines seem to divide the\r\nsloping tracts in which they occur into large irregular fields, laid out\r\nconsiderably more in accordance with the principles of the landscape\r\ngardener than the stiffly squared rectilinear fields of the\r\nagriculturist. They are _ha-has_ of Nature's digging; and their bottom\r\nand sides in this part of the country we still find occupied in a few\r\ncases--though in many more they have been ravaged by the wasteful\r\naxe--by noble forest-_hedges_, tall enough to overtop, in at least their\r\nmiddle reaches, the tracts of table-land which they divide.\r\n\r\nI passed, a little farther on, the quarry of Old Red Sandstone, with a\r\nhuge bank of boulder-clay resting over it, in which I first experienced\r\nthe evils of hard labor, and first set myself to lessen their weight by\r\nbecoming an observer of geological phenomena. It had been deserted\r\napparently for many years; and the debris of the clay partially covered\r\nup, in a sloping talus, the frontage of rock beneath. Old Red Sandstone\r\nand boulder-clay, a broad bar of each!--such was the compound problem\r\nwhich the excavation propounded to me when I first plied the tool in\r\nit,--a problem equally dark at the time in both its parts. I have since\r\ngot on a very little way with the Old Red portion of the task; but alas\r\nfor the boulder-clay portion of it! A bar of impenetrable shadow has\r\nrested long and obstinately over the newer deposit; and I scarce know\r\nwhether the light which is at length beginning to play on its pebbly\r\nfront be that of the sun or of a delusive meteor. But courage, patient\r\nhearts! the boulder-clay will one day yield up _its_ secret too. Still\r\nfurther on by a few hundred yards, I could have again found use for the\r\ncalotype, in transferring to paper the likeness of a protuberant\r\npicturesque cliff, which, like the Giants' Graves, could have belonged,\r\nof all our Scotch deposits, to only the boulder-clay. It stands out, on\r\nthe steep acclivity of a furze-covered bank, abrupt as a precipice of\r\nsolid rock, and yet seamed by the rain into numerous divergent channels,\r\nwith pyramidal peaks between; and, combining the perpendicularity of a\r\ntrue cliff with the water-scooped furrows of a yielding clay, it\r\npresents a peculiarity of aspect which strikes, by its grotesqueness,\r\neyes little accustomed to detect the picturesque in landscape. I\r\nremember standing to gaze upon it when a mere child; and the fisher\r\nchildren of the neighboring town still tell that \"_it has been\r\nprophesied_\" it will one day fall, \"and kill a man and a horse on the\r\nroad below,\"--a legend which shows it must have attracted _their_ notice\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nI selected as the special scene of exploration this morning, a deep\r\nravine of the boulder-clay, which had been recently deepened still more\r\nby the waters of a mill-pond, that had burst during a thunder-shower,\r\nand, after scooping out for themselves a bed in the clay some twelve or\r\nfifteen feet deep, where there had been formerly merely a shallow drain,\r\nhad then tumbled into the ravine, and bared it to the rock. The\r\nsandstones of the district, soft and not very durable, show the\r\nscratched and polished surfaces but indifferently well, and, when\r\nexposed to the weather, soon lose them; but in the bottom of the runnel\r\nby which the ravine is swept I found them exceedingly well marked,--the\r\npolish as decided as the soft red stone could receive, and the lines of\r\nscratching running in their general bearing due east and west, at nearly\r\nright angles with the course of the stream. Wherever the rock had been\r\nlaid bare during the last few months, _there_ were the markings;\r\nwherever it had been laid bare for a few twelvemonths, they were gone. I\r\nnext marked a circumstance which has now for several years been\r\nattracting my attention, and which I have found an invariable\r\ncharacteristic of the true boulder-clay. Not only do the rocks on which\r\nthe deposit rests bear the scratched and polished surfaces, but in every\r\ninstance the fragments of stone which it incloses bear the scratchings\r\nalso, if from their character capable of receiving and retaining such\r\nmarkings, and neither of too coarse a grain nor of too hard a quality.\r\nIf of limestone, or of a coherent shale, or of a close, finely-grained\r\nsandstone, or of a yielding trap, they are scratched and\r\npolished,--invariably on one, most commonly on both their sides; and it\r\nis a noticeable circumstance, that the lines of the scratchings occur,\r\nin at least nine cases out of every ten, in the lines of their longer\r\naxes. When decidedly oblong or spindle-shaped, the scratchings run\r\nlengthwise, preserving in most cases, on the under and upper sides, when\r\nboth surfaces are scratched, a parallelism singularly exact; whereas,\r\nwhen of a broader form, so that the length and breadth nearly\r\napproximate,--though the lines generally find out the longer axis, and\r\nrun in that direction,--they are less exact in their parallelism, and\r\nare occasionally traversed by cross furrows. Of such certain occurrence\r\nis this longitudinal lining on the softer and finer-grained pebbles of\r\nthe boulder-clay, that I have come to regard it as that special\r\ncharacteristic of the deposit on which I can most surely rely for\r\npurposes of identification. I am never quite certain of the boulder-clay\r\nwhen I do not detect it, nor doubtful of the true character of the\r\ndeposit when I do. When examining, for instance, the accumulation of\r\nbroken Liasic materials in the neighborhood of Banff, I made it my first\r\ncare to ascertain whether the bank inclosed fragments of stone or shale\r\nbearing the longitudinal markings; and felt satisfied, on finding that\r\nit did, that I had discovered the period of its re-formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     Organisms of the Boulder-clay not unequivocal--First Impressions of\r\n     the Boulder-clay--Difficulty of accounting for its barrenness of\r\n     Remains--Sir Charles Lyell's reasoning--A Fact to the\r\n     contrary--Human Skull dug from a Clay-bank--The Author's Change of\r\n     Belief respecting Organic Remains of the Boulder-clay--Shells from\r\n     the Clay at Wick--Questions respecting them settled--Conclusions\r\n     confirmed by Mr. Dick's Discoveries at Thurso--Sir John Sinclair's\r\n     Discovery of Boulder-clay Shells in 1802--Comminution of the Shells\r\n     illustrated--_Cyprina islandica_--Its Preservation in larger\r\n     Proportions than those of other Shells accounted for--Boulder-clays\r\n     of Scotland reformed during the existing Geological Epoch--Scotland\r\n     in the Period of the Boulder-clay \"merely three detached groups of\r\n     Islands\"--Evidence of the Subsidence of the Land in\r\n     Scotland--Confirmed by Rev.

I had ascertained that it\r\ncontains in Ross and Cromarty nodules of the Old Red Sandstone, which\r\nbear inside, like so many stone coffins, their well laid out skeletons\r\nof the dead; but then the markings on their surface told me that when\r\nthe boulder-clay was in the course of deposition, they had been exactly\r\nthe same kind of nodules that they are now. In Moray, it incloses, I had\r\nfound, organisms of the Lias; but _they_ also testify that they present\r\nan appearance in no degree more ancient at the present time than they\r\ndid when first enveloped by the clay. In East and West Lothian too, and\r\nin the neighborhood of Edinburgh, I had detected in it occasional\r\norganisms of the Mountain Limestone and the Coal Measures; but these,\r\nnot less surely than its Liasic fossils in Moray, and its Old Red\r\nichthyolites in Cromarty and Ross, belonged to an incalculably more\r\nancient state of things than itself; and--like those shrivelled\r\nmanuscripts of Pompeii or Herculaneum, which, whatever else they may\r\nrecord, cannot be expected to tell aught of the catastrophe that buried\r\nthem up--they throw no light whatever on the deposit in which they\r\noccur. I at length came to regard the boulder-clay--for it is difficult\r\nto keep the mind in a purely blank state on any subject on which one\r\nthinks a good deal--as representative of a chaotic period of death and\r\ndarkness, introductory, mayhap, to the existing scene of things.\r\n\r\nAfter, however, I had begun to mark the invariable connection of the\r\nclay, as a deposit, with the dressed surfaces on which it rests, and the\r\nlongitudinal linings of the pebbles and boulders which it incloses, and\r\nto associate it, in consequence, with an ice-charged sea and the Great\r\nGulf Stream, it seemed to me extremely difficult to assign a reason why\r\nit should be thus barren of remains. Sir Charles Lyell states, in his\r\n\"Elements,\" that the \"stranding of ice-islands in the bays of Iceland\r\nsince 1835 has driven away the fish for several successive seasons, and\r\nthereby caused a famine among the inhabitants of the country;\" and he\r\nargues from the fact, \"that a sea habitually infested with melting ice,\r\nwhich would chill and freshen the water, might render the same\r\nuninhabitable by marine mollusca.\" But then, on the other hand, it is\r\nequally a fact that half a million of seals have been killed in a single\r\nseason on the meadow-ice a little to the north of Newfoundland, and that\r\nmany millions of cod, besides other fish, are captured yearly on the\r\nshores of that island, though grooved and furrowed by ice-floes almost\r\nevery spring. Of the seal family it is specially recorded by\r\nnaturalists, that many of the species \"are from choice inhabitants of\r\nthe margins of the frozen seas towards both poles; and, of course, in\r\nlocalities in which many such animals live, some must occasionally die.\"\r\nAnd though the grinding process would certainly have disjointed, and\r\nmight probably have worn down and partially mutilated, the bones of the\r\namphibious carnivora of the boulder period, it seems not in the least\r\nprobable, judging from the fragments of loose-grained sandstone and soft\r\nshale which it has spared, that it would have wholly destroyed them. So\r\nit happened, however, that from North Berwick to the Ord Hill of\r\nCaithness, I had never found in the boulder-clay the slightest trace of\r\nan organism that could be held to belong to itself; and as it seems\r\nnatural to build on negative evidence, if very extensive, considerably\r\nmore than mere negative evidence, whatever the circumstances, will\r\ncarry, I became somewhat skeptical regarding the very existence of\r\nboulder-fossils,--a skepticism which the worse than doubtful character\r\nof several supposed discoveries in the deposit served considerably to\r\nstrengthen. The clay forms, when cut by a water-course, or assailed on\r\nthe coast by some unusually high tide, a perpendicular precipice, which\r\nin the course of years slopes into a talus; and as it exhibits in most\r\ninstances no marks of stratification, the clay of the talus--a mere\r\nre-formation of fragments detached by the frosts and rains from the\r\nexposed frontage--can rarely be distinguished from that of the original\r\ndeposit. Now, in these consolidated slopes it is not unusual to find\r\nremains, animal and vegetable, of no very remote antiquity. I have seen\r\na human skull dug out of the reclining base of a clay-bank once a\r\nprecipice, fully six feet from under the surface. It might have been\r\ndeemed the skull of some long-lived contemporary of Enoch,--one of the\r\naccursed race, mayhap,\r\n\r\n \"Who sinned and died before the avenging flood.\"\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the laborer dug a little further, and struck his pickaxe\r\nagainst an old rybat that lay deeper still. There could be no mistaking\r\nthe character of the champfered edge, that still bore the marks of the\r\ntool, nor that of the square perforation for the lock-bolt; and a rising\r\ntheory, that would have referred the boulder-clay to a period in which\r\nthe polar ice, set loose by the waters of the Noachian deluge, came\r\nfloating southwards over the foundered land, straightway stumbled\r\nagainst it, and fell. Both rybat and skull had come from an ancient\r\nburying-ground, that occupies a projecting angle of the table-land\r\nabove. I must now state, however, that my skepticism has thoroughly\r\ngiven way; and that, slowly yielding to the force of positive evidence,\r\nI have become as assured a believer in the _comminuted recent shells_ of\r\nthe boulder-clay as in the belemnites of the Oolite and Lias, or the\r\nganoid ichthyolites of the Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nI had marked, when at Wick, on several occasions, a thick boulder-clay\r\ndeposit occupying the southern side of the harbor, and forming an\r\nelevated platform, on which the higher parts of Pulteneytown are built;\r\nbut I had noted little else regarding it than that it bears the average\r\ndark-gray color of the flagstones of the district, and that some of the\r\ngranitic boulders which protrude from its top and sides are of vast\r\nsize. On my last visit, however, rather more than two years ago, when\r\nsauntering along its base, after a very wet morning, awaiting the Orkney\r\nsteamer, I was surprised to find, where a small slip had taken place\r\nduring the rain, that it was mottled over with minute fragments of\r\nshells. These I examined, and found, so far as, in their extremely\r\nbroken condition, I dared determine the point, that they belonged in\r\nsuch large proportion to one species,--the _Cyprina islandica_ of Dr.\r\nFleming,--that I could detect among them only a single fragment of any\r\nother shell,--the pillar, apparently, of a large specimen of _Purpura\r\nlapillus_. Both shells belong to that class of old existences,--long\r\ndescended, without the pride of ancient descent,--which link on the\r\nextinct to the recent scenes of being. _Cyprina islandica_ and _Purpura\r\nlapillus_ not only exist as living molluscs in the British seas, but\r\nthey occur also as crag-shells, side by side with the dead races that\r\nhave no place in the present fauna. At this time, however, I could but\r\nthink of them simply in their character as recent molluscs; and as it\r\nseemed quite startling enough to find them in a deposit which I had once\r\ndeemed representative of a period of death, and still continued to\r\nregard as obstinately unfossiliferous, I next set myself to determine\r\nwhether it really _was_ the boulder-clay in which they occurred. Almost\r\nthe first pebble which I disengaged from the mass, however, settled the\r\npoint, by furnishing the evidence on which for several years past I have\r\nbeen accustomed to settle it;--it bore in the line of its longer axis,\r\non a polished surface, the freshly-marked grooves and scratchings of the\r\niceberg era. Still, however, I had my doubts, not regarding the deposit,\r\nbut the shells. Might they not belong merely to the talus of this bank\r\nof boulder-clay?--a re-formation, in all probability, not _more_ ancient\r\nthan the elevation of the most recent of the old coast lines,--perhaps\r\ngreatly less so. Meeting with an intelligent citizen of Wick, Mr. John\r\nCleghorn, I requested him to keep a vigilant eye on the shells, and to\r\nascertain for me, when opportunity offered, whether they occurred deep\r\nin the deposit, or were restricted to merely the base of its exposed\r\nfront. On my return from Orkney, he kindly brought me a small collection\r\nof fragments, exclusively, so far as I could judge, of _Cyprina\r\nislandica_, picked up in fresh sections of the clay; at the same time\r\nexpressing his belief that they really belonged to the deposit as such,\r\nand were not accidental introductions into it from the adjacent shore.\r\nAnd at this point for nearly two years the matter rested, when my\r\nattention was again called to it by finding, in the publication of Mr.\r\nKeith Johnston's admirable Geological Map of the British Islands, edited\r\nby Professor Edward Forbes, that other eyes than mine had detected\r\nshells in the boulder-clay of Caithness. \"Cliffs of Pleistocene,\" says\r\nthe Professor, in one of his notes attached to the map, \"occur at Wick,\r\ncontaining boreal shells, especially _Astarte borealis_.\"\r\n\r\nI had seen the boulder-clay characteristically developed in the\r\nneighborhood of Thurso; but, during a rather hurried visit, had lacked\r\ntime to examine it. The omission mattered the less, however, as my\r\nfriend Mr. Robert Dick is resident in the locality; and there are few\r\nmen who examine more carefully or more perseveringly than he, or who can\r\nenjoy with higher relish the sweets of scientific research. I wrote him\r\nregarding Professor Forbes's decision on the boulder-clay of Wick and\r\nits shells; urging him to ascertain whether the boulder-clay of Thurso\r\nhad not its shells also. And almost by return of post I received from\r\nhim, in reply, a little packet of comminuted shells, dug out of a\r\ndeposit of the boulder-clay, laid open by the river Thorsa, a full mile\r\nfrom the sea, and from eighty to a hundred feet over its level. He had\r\ndetected minute fragments of shell in the clay about a twelvemonth\r\nbefore; but a skepticism somewhat similar to my own, added to the dread\r\nof being deceived by mere surface shells, recently derived from the\r\nshore in the character _of_ shell-sand, or of the edible species carried\r\ninland for food, and then transferred from the ash-pit to the fields,\r\nhad not only prevented him from following up the discovery, but even\r\nfrom thinking of it as such. But he eagerly followed it up now, by\r\nvisiting every bank of the boulder-clay in his locality within twenty\r\nmiles of Thurso, and found them all charged, from top to bottom, with\r\ncomminuted shells, however great their distance from the sea, or their\r\nelevation over it. The fragments lie thick along the course of the\r\nThorsa, where the encroaching stream is scooping out the clay for the\r\nfirst time since its deposition, and laying bare the scratched and\r\nfurrowed pebbles. They occur, too, in the depths of solitary ravines far\r\namid the moors, and underlie heath, and moss, and vegetable mould, on\r\nthe exposed hill-sides. The farm-house of Dalemore, twelve miles from\r\nThurso as the crow flies, and rather more than thirteen miles from Wick,\r\noccupies, as nearly as may be, the centre of the county; and yet there,\r\nas on the sea-shore, the boulder-clay is charged with its fragments of\r\nmarine shells. Though so barren elsewhere on the east coast of Scotland,\r\nthe clay is everywhere in Caithness a shell-bearing deposit; and no\r\nsooner had Mr. Dick determined the fact for himself, at the expense of\r\nmany a fatiguing journey, and many an hour's hard digging, than he found\r\nthat it had been ascertained long before, though, from the very\r\ninadequate style in which it had been recorded, science had in scarce\r\nany degree benefited by the discovery. In 1802 the late Sir John\r\nSinclair, distinguished for his enlightened zeal in developing the\r\nagricultural resources of the country, and for originating its\r\nstatistics, employed a mineralogical surveyor to explore the underground\r\ntreasures of the district; and the surveyor's journal he had printed\r\nunder the title of \"Minutes and Observations drawn up in the course of a\r\nMineralogical Survey of the County of Caithness, ann. 1802, by John\r\nBusby, Edinburgh.\" Now, in this journal there are frequent references\r\nmade to the occurrence of marine shells in the blue clay. Mr. Dick has\r\ncopied for me the two following entries,--for the work itself I have\r\nnever seen:--\"1802, Sept. 7th.--Surveyed down the river [Thorsa] to\r\nGeize; found blue clay-marl, _intermixed with marine shells_ in great\r\nabundance.\" \"Sept. 12th.--Set off this morning for Dalemore. Bored for\r\nshell-marl in the 'grass-park;' found it in one of the quagmires, but to\r\nno great extent. Bored for shell-marl in the 'house-park.' Surveyed by\r\nthe side of the river, and found blue clay-marl in great plenty,\r\n_intermixed with marine shells, such as those found at Geize_. This\r\nplace is supposed to be about twenty miles from the sea; and is one\r\ninstance, among many in Caithness, of _the ocean's covering the inland\r\ncountry at some former period of time_.\"\r\n\r\nThe state of keeping in which the boulder-shells of Caithness occur is\r\nexactly what, on the iceberg theory, might be premised. The ponderous\r\nice-rafts that went grating over the deep-sea bottom, grinding down its\r\nrocks into clay, and deeply furrowing its pebbles, must have borne\r\nheavily on its comparatively fragile shells. If rocks and pebbles did\r\nnot escape, the shells must have fared but hardly. And very hardly they\r\nhave fared: the rather unpleasant casualty of being crushed to death\r\nmust have been a greatly more common one in those days than in even the\r\npresent age of railways and machinery. The reader, by passing half a\r\nbushel of the common shells of our shores through a barley-mill, as a\r\npreliminary operation in the process, and by next subjecting the broken\r\nfragments thus obtained to the attritive influence of the waves on some\r\nstorm-beaten beach for a twelvemonth or two, as a finishing operation,\r\nmay produce, when he pleases, exactly such a water-worn shelly debris as\r\nmottles the blue boulder-clays of Caithness. The proportion borne by the\r\nfragments of one species of shell to that of all the others is very\r\nextraordinary. The _Cyprina islandica_ is still by no means a rare\r\nmollusc on our Scottish shores, and may, on an exposed coast, after a\r\nstorm, be picked up by dozens, attached to the roots of the deep-sea\r\ntangle. It is greatly less abundant, however, than such shells as\r\n_Purpura lapillus_, _Mytilus edule_, _Cardium edule_, _Littorina\r\nlittorea_, and several others; whereas in the boulder-clay it is, in the\r\nproportion of at least ten to one, more abundant than all the others put\r\ntogether. The great strength of the shell, however, may have in part led\r\nto this result; as I find that its stronger and massier portions,--those\r\nof the umbo and hinge-joint,--are exceedingly numerous in proportion to\r\nits slimmer and weaker fragments. \"The _Cyprina islandica_,\" says Dr.\r\nFleming, in his \"British Animals,\" \"is the largest British bivalve\r\nshell, measuring sometimes thirteen inches in circumference, and,\r\nexclusively of the animal, weighing upwards of nine ounces.\" Now, in a\r\ncollection of fragments of Cyprina sent me by Mr. Dick, disinterred from\r\nthe boulder-clay in various localities in the neighborhood of Thurso,\r\nand weighing in all about four ounces, I have detected the broken\r\nremains of no fewer than _sixteen_ hinge joints. And on the same\r\nprinciple through which the stronger fragments of Cyprina were preserved\r\nin so much larger proportion than the weaker ones, may Cyprina\r\nitself have been preserved in much larger proportion than its\r\nmore fragile neighbors. Occasionally, however,--escaped, as if by\r\naccident,--characteristic fragments are found of shells by no means\r\nvery strong,--such as _Mytilus_, _Tellina_, and _Astarte_. Among the\r\nunivalves I can distinguish _Dentalium entale_, _Purpura lapillus_,\r\n_Turritella terebra_, and _Littorina littorea_, all existing shells, but\r\nall common also to at least the later deposits of the Crag. And among\r\nthe bivalves Mr. Dick enumerates,--besides the prevailing _Cyprina\r\nislandica_,--_Venus casina_, _Cardium edule_, _Cardium echinatum_,\r\n_Mytilus edule_, _Astarte danmoniensis_ (_sulcata_), and _Astarte\r\ncompressa_, with a _Mactra_, _Artemis_, and _Tellina_.[15] All the\r\ndetermined species here, with the exception of _Mytilus edule_, have,\r\nwith many others, been found by the Rev. Mr. Cumming in the\r\nboulder-clays of the Isle of Man; and all of them are living shells at\r\nthe present day on our Scottish coasts. It seems scarce possible to fix\r\nthe age of a deposit so broken in its organisms, on the principle that\r\nwould first seek to determine its per centage of extinct shells as the\r\ndata on which to found. One has to search sedulously and long ere a\r\nfragment turns up sufficiently entire for the purpose of specific\r\nidentification, even when it belongs to a well-known living shell; and\r\ndid the clay contain some six or eight per cent. of the extinct in a\r\nsimilarly broken condition (and there is no evidence that it contains a\r\nsingle per cent. of extinct shells), I know not how, in the\r\ncircumstances, the fact could ever be determined. A lifetime might be\r\ndevoted to the task of fixing their real proportion, and yet be devoted\r\nto it in vain. All that at present can be said is, that, judging from\r\nwhat appears, the boulder-clays of Caithness, and with them the\r\nboulder-clays of Scotland generally, and of the Isle of Man,--for they\r\nare all palpably connected with the same iceberg phenomena, and occur\r\nalong the same zone in reference to the sea-level,--were formed during\r\nthe _existing_ geological epoch.\r\n\r\nThese details may appear tediously minute; but let the reader mark how\r\nvery much they involve. The occurrence of recent shells largely diffused\r\nthroughout the boulder-clays of Caithness, at all heights and distances\r\nfrom the sea at which the clay itself occurs, and not only connected\r\nwith the iceberg phenomena by the closest juxtaposition, but also\r\ntestifying distinctly to its agency by the extremely comminuted state in\r\nwhich we find them, tell us, not only according to old John Busby, \"that\r\nthe ocean covered the inland country at some former period of time,\" but\r\nthat it covered it to a great height at a time geologically recent, when\r\nour seas were inhabited by exactly the same mollusca as inhabit them\r\nnow, and so far as yet appears, by none others. I have not yet detected\r\nthe boulder-clay at more than from six to eight hundred feet over the\r\nlevel of the sea; but the travelled boulders I have often found at more\r\nthan a thousand feet over it; and Dr. John Fleming, the correctness of\r\nwhose observations few men acquainted with the character of his\r\nresearches or of his mind will be disposed to challenge, has informed me\r\nthat he has detected the dressed and polished surfaces at least four\r\nhundred feet higher. There occurs a greenstone boulder, of from twelve\r\nto fourteen tons weight, says Mr. M'Laren, in his \"Geology of Fife and\r\nthe Lothians,\" on the south side of Black Hill (one of the Pentland\r\nrange), at about fourteen hundred feet over the sea. Now fourteen or\r\nfifteen hundred feet, taken as the extreme height of the dressings,\r\nthough they are said to occur greatly higher, would serve to submerge in\r\nthe iceberg ocean almost the whole agricultural region of Scotland. The\r\ncommon hazel (_Corylus avellana_) ceases to grow in the latitude of the\r\nGrampians, at from one thousand two hundred to one thousand five hundred\r\nfeet over the sea level; the common bracken (_Pteris aquilina_) at about\r\nthe same height; and corn is never successfully cultivated at a greater\r\naltitude. Where the hazel and bracken cease to grow, it is in vain to\r\nattempt growing corn.[16] In the period of the boulder-clay, then, when\r\nthe existing shells of our coasts lived in those inland sounds and\r\nfriths of the country that now exist as broad plains or fertile valleys,\r\nthe sub-aerial superficies of Scotland was restricted to what are now\r\nits barren and mossy regions, and formed, instead of one continuous\r\nland, merely three detached groups of islands,--the small Cheviot and\r\nHartfell group,--the greatly larger Grampian and Ben Nevis group,--and a\r\ngroup intermediate in size, extending from Mealfourvonny, on the\r\nnorthern shores of Loch Ness, to the Maiden Paps of Caithness.\r\n\r\nThe more ancient boulder-clays of Scotland seem to have been formed when\r\nthe land was undergoing a slow process of subsidence, or, as I should\r\nperhaps rather say, when a very considerable area of the earth's\r\nsurface, including the sea-bottom, as well as the eminences that rose\r\nover it, was the subject of a gradual depression; for little or no\r\nalteration appears to have taken place at the time in the _relative_\r\nlevels of the higher and lower portions of the sinking area: the\r\nfeatures of the land in the northern part of the kingdom, from the\r\nsouthern flanks of the Grampians to the Pentland Frith, seemed to have\r\nbeen fixed in nearly the existing forms many ages before, at the close,\r\napparently, of the Oolitic period, and at a still earlier age in the\r\nLammermuir district, to the south. And so the sea around our shores must\r\nhave deepened in the ratio in which the hills sank. The evidence of this\r\nprocess of subsidence is of a character tolerably satisfactory. The\r\ndressed surfaces occur in Scotland, most certainly, as I have already\r\nstated on the authority of Dr. Fleming, at the height of fourteen\r\nhundred feet over the present sea-level; it has been even said, at\r\nfully twice that height, on the lofty flanks of Schehallion,--a\r\nstatement, however, which I have had hitherto no opportunity of\r\nverifying. They may be found, too, equally well marked, under the\r\nexisting high-water line; and it is obviously impossible that the\r\ndressing process could have been going on at the higher and lower levels\r\nat the same time. When the icebergs were grating along the more elevated\r\nrocks, the low-lying ones must have been buried under from three to\r\nseven hundred fathoms of water,--a depth from three to seven times\r\ngreater, be it remembered, than that at which the most ponderous iceberg\r\ncould possibly have grounded, or have in any degree affected the bottom.\r\nThe dressing process, then, must have been a bit-and-bit process,\r\ncarried on during either a period of elevation, in which the rising land\r\nwas subjected, zone after zone, to the sweep of the armed ice from its\r\nhigher levels _downwards_, or during a period of subsidence, in which it\r\nwas subjected to the ice, zone after zone, from its lower levels\r\n_upwards_. And that it was the lower, not the higher levels, that were\r\nfirst dressed, appears evident from the circumstance, that though on\r\nthese lower levels we find the rocks covered up by continuous beds of\r\nthe boulder-clay, varying generally from twenty to a hundred feet in\r\nthickness, they are, notwithstanding, as completely dressed under the\r\nclay as on the heights above. Had it been a rising land that was\r\nsubjected to the attrition of the icebergs, the debris and dressings of\r\nthe higher rocks would have protected the lower from the attrition; and\r\nso the thick accumulation of boulder-clay which overlies the old coast\r\nline, for instance, would have rested, not on dressed, but on undressed\r\nsurfaces. The barer rocks of the lower levels might of course exhibit\r\ntheir scratchings and polishings, like those of the higher; but wherever\r\nthese scratchings and polishings occurred in the inferior zones, no\r\nthick protecting stratum of boulder-clay would be found overlying them;\r\nand, _vice versa_, wherever in these zones there occurred thick beds of\r\nboulder-clay, there would be detected on the rock beneath no scratchings\r\nand polishings. In order to _dress_ the entire surface of a country from\r\nthe sea-line and under it to the tops of its hills, and at the same time\r\nto cover up extensive portions of its low-lying rocks with vast deposits\r\nof clay, it seems a necessary condition of the process that it should be\r\ncarried on piece-meal from the lower level upwards,--not from the higher\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nIt interested me much to find, that while from one set of appearances I\r\nhad been inferring the gradual subsidence of the land during the period\r\nof the boulder-clay, the Rev. Mr. Cumming of King William's College had\r\narrived, from the consideration of quite a different class of phenomena,\r\nat a similar conclusion. \"It appears to me highly probable,\" I find him\r\nremarking, in his lately published \"Isle of man,\" \"that at the\r\ncommencement of the boulder period there was a gradual sinking of this\r\narea [that of the island]. Successively, therefore, the points at\r\ndifferent degrees of elevation were brought within the influence of the\r\nsea, and exposed to the rake of the tides, charged with masses of ice\r\nwhich had been floated off from the surrounding shores, and bearing on\r\ntheir under surfaces, mud, gravel, and fragments of hard rock.\" Mr.\r\nCumming goes on to describe, in his volume, some curious appearances,\r\nwhich seem to bear direct on this point, in connection with a boss of a\r\npeculiarly-compounded granite, which occurs in the southern part of the\r\nisland, about seven hundred feet over the level of the sea. There rise\r\non the western side of the boss two hills, one of which attains to the\r\nelevation of nearly seven hundred, and the other of nearly eight hundred\r\nfeet over it; and yet both hills to their summits are mottled over with\r\ngranite boulders, furnished by the comparatively low-lying boss. One of\r\nthese travelled masses, fully two tons in weight, lies not sixty feet\r\nfrom the summit of the loftier hill, at an altitude of nearly fifteen\r\nhundred feet over the sea. Now, it seems extremely difficult to conceive\r\nof any other agency than that of a rising sea or of a subsiding land,\r\nthrough which these masses could have been rolled up the steep slopes of\r\nthe hills. Had the boulder period been a period of elevation, or merely\r\na stationary period, during which the land neither rose nor sank, the\r\ntravelled boulders would not now be found resting at higher levels than\r\nthat of the parent rock whence they were derived. We occasionally meet\r\non our shores, after violent storms from the sea, stones that have been\r\nrolled from their place at low ebb to nearly the line of flood; but we\r\nalways find that it was by the waves of the rising, not of the falling\r\ntide, that their transport was effected. For whatever removals of the\r\nkind take place during an ebbing sea are invariably in an opposite\r\ndirection;--they are removals, not from lower to higher levels, but from\r\nhigher to lower.\r\n\r\nThe upper subsoils of Scotland bear frequent mark of the elevatory\r\nperiod which succeeded this period of depression. The boulder-clay has\r\nits numerous intercalated arenaceous and gravelly beds, which belong\r\nevidently to its own era; but the numerous surface-beds of stratified\r\nsand and gravel by which in so many localities it is overlaid belong\r\nevidently to a later time. When, after possibly a long protracted\r\nperiod, the land again began to rise, or the sea to fall, the superior\r\nportions of the boulder-clay must have been exposed to the action of the\r\ntides and waves; and the same process of separation of parts must have\r\ntaken place on a large scale, which one occasionally sees taking place\r\nin the present time on a comparatively small one, in ravines of the same\r\nclay swept by a streamlet. After every shower, the stream comes down\r\nred and turbid with the finer and more argillaceous portions of the\r\ndeposit; minute accumulations of sand are swept to the gorge of the\r\nravine, or cast down in ripple-marked patches in its deeper pools; beds\r\nof pebbles and gravel are heaped up in every inflection of its banks;\r\nand boulders are laid bare along its sides. Now, a separation, by a sort\r\nof washing process of an analogous character, must have taken place in\r\nthe materials of the more exposed portions of the boulder-clay, during\r\nthe gradual emergence of the land; and hence, apparently, those\r\nextensive beds of sand and gravel which in so many parts of the kingdom\r\nexist, in relation to the clay, as a superior or upper subsoil; hence,\r\ntoo, occasional beds of a purer clay than that beneath, divested of a\r\nconsiderable portion of its arenaceous components, and of almost all its\r\npebbles and boulders. This _washed_ clay,--a re-formation of the boulder\r\ndeposit, cast down, mostly in insulated beds in quiet localities, where\r\nthe absence of currents suffered the purer particles held in suspension\r\nby the water to settle,--forms, in Scotland at least, with, of course,\r\nthe exception of the ancient fire-clays of the Coal Measures, the true\r\nbrick and tile clays of the agriculturist and architect.\r\n\r\nIt is to these superior beds that all the recent shells yet found above\r\nthe existing sea-level in Scotland, from the Dornoch Frith and beyond\r\nit, to beyond the Frith of Forth, seem to belong. Their period is much\r\nless remote than that of the shells of the boulder-clay, and they rarely\r\noccur in the same comminuted condition. They existed, it would appear,\r\nnot during the chill twilight period, when the land was in a state of\r\nsubsidence, but during the after period of cheerful dawn, when hill-top\r\nafter hill-top was emerging from the deep, and the close of each passing\r\ncentury witnessed a broader area of dry land in what is now Scotland,\r\nthan the close of the century which had gone before. Scandinavia is\r\nsimilarly rising at the present day, and presents with every succeeding\r\nage a more extended breadth of surface. Many of the boulder-stones seem\r\nto have been cast down where they now lie, during this latter time. When\r\nthey occur, as in many instances, high on bare hill-tops, from five to\r\nfifteen hundred feet over the sea-level, with neither gravel nor\r\nboulder-clay beside them, we of course cannot fix their period. They may\r\nhave been dropped by ice-floes or shore-ice, where we now find them, at\r\nthe commencement of the period of elevation, after the clay had been\r\nformed; or they may have been deposited by more ponderous icebergs\r\nduring its formation, when the land was yet sinking, though during the\r\nsubsequent rise the clay may have been washed from around them to lower\r\nlevels. The boulders, however, which we find scattered over the plains\r\nand less elevated hill-sides, with beds of the washed gravel or sand\r\ninterposed between them and the clay, must have been cast down where\r\nthey lie, during the elevatory ages. For, had they been washed out of\r\nthe clay, they would have lain, not _over_ the greatly lighter sands and\r\ngravels, but _under_ them. Would that they could write their own\r\nhistories! The autobiography of a single boulder, with notes on the\r\nvarious floras which had sprung up around it, and the various classes of\r\nbirds, beasts, and insects by which it had been visited, would be worth\r\nnine-tenths of all the autobiographies ever published, and a moiety of\r\nthe remainder to boot.\r\n\r\nA few hundred yards from the opening of this dell of the boulder-clay,\r\nin which I have so long detained the reader, there is a wooded\r\ninflection of the bank, formed by the old coast line, in which there\r\nstood, about two centuries ago, a meal-mill, with the cottage of the\r\nmiller, and which was once known as the scene of one of those\r\nsupernaturalities that belong to the times of the witch and the fairy.\r\nThe upper anchoring-place of the bay lies nearly opposite the\r\ninflection. A shipmaster, who had moored his vessel in this part of the\r\nroadstead, some time in the latter days of the first Charles, was one\r\nfine evening sitting alone on deck, awaiting the return of his seamen,\r\nwho had gone ashore, and amusing himself in watching the lights that\r\ntwinkled from the scattered farm-houses, and in listening, in the\r\nextreme stillness of the calm, to the distant lowing of cattle, or the\r\nabrupt bark of the herdsman's dog. As the hour wore later, the sounds\r\nceased, and the lights disappeared,--all but one solitary taper, that\r\ntwinkled from the window of the miller's cottage. At length, however, it\r\nalso disappeared, and all was dark around the shores of the bay, as a\r\nbelt of black velvet. Suddenly a hissing noise was heard overhead; the\r\nshipmaster looked up, and saw what seemed to be one of those meteors\r\nknown as falling stars, slanting athwart the heavens in the direction of\r\nthe cottage, and increasing in size and brilliancy as it neared the\r\nearth, until the wooded ridge and the shore could be seen as distinctly\r\nfrom the ship-deck as by day. A dog howled piteously from one of the\r\nout-houses,--an owl whooped from the wood. The meteor descended until it\r\nalmost touched the roof, when a cock crew from within; its progress\r\nseemed instantly arrested; it stood still, rose about the height of a\r\nship's mast, and then began again to descend. The cock crew a second\r\ntime; it rose as before; and, after mounting considerably higher than at\r\nfirst, again sank in the line of the cottage, to be again arrested by\r\nthe crowing of the cock. It mounted yet a third time, rising higher\r\nstill; and, in its last descent, had almost touched the roof, when the\r\nfaint clap of wings was heard as if whispered over the water, followed\r\nby a still louder note of defiance from the cock. The meteor rose with a\r\nbound, and, continuing to ascend until it seemed lost among the stars,\r\ndid not again appear. Next night, however, at the same hour, the same\r\nscene was repeated in all its circumstances: the meteor descended, the\r\ndog howled, the owl whooped, the cock crew. On the following morning the\r\nshipmaster visited the miller's, and, curious to ascertain how the\r\ncottage would fare when the cock was away, he purchased the bird; and,\r\nsailing from the bay before nightfall, did not return until about a\r\nmonth after.\r\n\r\nOn his voyage inwards, he had no sooner doubled an intervening headland,\r\nthan he stepped forward to the bows to take a peep at the cottage: it\r\nhad vanished. As he approached the anchoring ground, he could discern a\r\nheap of blackened stones occupying the place where it had stood; and he\r\nwas informed on going ashore, that it had been burnt to the ground, no\r\none knew how, on the very night he had quitted the bay. He had it\r\nre-built and furnished, says the story, deeming himself what one of the\r\nold schoolmen perhaps term the _occasional_ cause of the disaster. He\r\nalso returned the cock,--probably a not less important benefit,--and no\r\nafter accident befel the cottage. About fifteen years ago there was a\r\nhuman skeleton dug up near the scene of the tradition, with the skull,\r\nand the bones of the legs and feet, lying close together, as if the body\r\nhad been huddled up twofold in a hole; and this discovery led to that of\r\nthe story, which, though at one time often repeated and extensively\r\nbelieved, had been suffered to sleep in the memories of a few elderly\r\npeople for nearly sixty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Relation of the deep red stone of Cromarty to the Ichthyolite Beds\r\n     of the System--Ruins of a Fossil-charged Bed--Journey to Avoch--Red\r\n     Dye of the Boulder-clay distinct from the substance\r\n     itself--Variation of Coloring in the Boulder-clay Red Sandstone\r\n     accounted for--Hard-pan how formed--A reformed Garden--An ancient\r\n     Battle-field--Antiquity of Geologic and Human History\r\n     compared--Burn of Killein--Observation made in boyhood\r\n     confirmed--Fossil-nodules--Fine Specimen of _Coccosteus\r\n     decipiens_--Blank strata of Old Red--New View respecting the Rocks\r\n     of Black Isle--A Trip up Moray and Dingwall Friths--Altered color\r\n     of the Boulder-clay--Up the Auldgrande River--Scenery of the great\r\n     Conglomerate--Graphic Description--Laidlaw's Boulder--_Vaccinium\r\n     myrtillus_--Profusion of Travelled Boulders--The Boulder _Clach\r\n     Malloch_--Its zones of Animal and Vegetable Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ravine excavated by the mill-dam showed me what I had never so well\r\nseen before,--the exact relation borne by the deep red stone of the\r\nCromarty quarries to the ichthyolite beds of the system. It occupies the\r\nsame place, and belongs to the same period, as those superior beds of\r\nthe Lower Old Red Sandstone which are so largely developed in the cliffs\r\nof Dunnet Head in Caithness, and of Tarbet Ness in Ross-shire, and which\r\nwere at one time regarded as forming, north of the Grampians, the\r\nanalogue of the New Red Sandstone. I paced it across the strata this\r\nmorning, in the line of the ravine, and found its thickness over the\r\nupper fish-beds, though I was far from reaching its superior layers,\r\nwhich are buried here in the sea, to be rather more than five hundred\r\nfeet. The fossiliferous beds occur a few hundred yards below the\r\ndwelling-house of Rose Farm. They are not quite uncovered in the ravine;\r\nbut we find their places indicated by heaps of gray argillaceous shale,\r\nmingled with their characteristic ichthyolitic nodules, in one of which\r\nI found a small specimen of Cheiracanthus. The projecting edge of some\r\nfossil-charged bed had been struck, mayhap, by an iceberg, and dashed\r\ninto ruins, just as the subsiding land had brought the spot within reach\r\nof the attritive ice; and the broken heap thus detached had been shortly\r\nafterwards covered up, without mixture of any other deposit, by the red\r\nboulder-clay. On the previous day I had detected the fish-beds in\r\nanother new locality,--one of the ravines of the lawn of Cromarty\r\nHouse,--where the gray shale, concealed by a covering of soil and sward\r\nfor centuries, had been laid bare during the storm by a swollen runnel,\r\nand a small nodule, inclosing a characteristic plate of Pterichthys,\r\nwashed out. And my next object in to-day's journey, after exploring this\r\nravine of the boulder-clay, was to ascertain whether the beds did not\r\nalso occur in a ravine of the parish of Avoch, some eight or nine miles\r\naway, which, when lying a-bed one night in Edinburgh, I remembered\r\nhaving crossed when a boy, at a point which lies considerably out of the\r\nordinary route of the traveller. I had remarked on this occasion, as the\r\nresuscitated recollection intimated, that the precipices of the Avoch\r\nravine bore, at the unfrequented point, the peculiar aspect which I\r\nlearned many years after to associate with the ichthyolitic member of\r\nthe system; and I was now quite as curious to test the truth of a sort\r\nof vignette landscape, transferred to the mind at an immature period of\r\nlife, and preserved in it for full thirty years, as desirous to extend\r\nmy knowledge of the fossiliferous beds of a system to the elucidation of\r\nwhich I had peculiarly devoted myself.\r\n\r\nAs the traveller reaches the flat moory uplands of the parish, where the\r\nwater stagnates amid heath and moss over a thin layer of peaty soil, he\r\nfinds the underlying boulder-clay, as shown in the chance sections,\r\nspotted and streaked with patches of a grayish-white. There is the same\r\nmixture of arenaceous and aluminous particles in the white as in the red\r\nportions of the mass; for, as we see so frequently exemplified in the\r\nspots and streaks of the Red Sandstone formations, whether Old or New,\r\nthe coloring matter has been discharged without any accompanying change\r\nof composition in the substance which it pervaded;--evidence enough that\r\nthe red dye must be something distinct from the substance itself, just\r\nas the dye of a handkerchief is a thing distinct from the silk or cotton\r\nyarn of which the handkerchief has been woven. The stagnant water above,\r\nacidulated by its various vegetable solutions, seems to have been in\r\nsome way connected with these appearances. In every case in which a\r\ncrack through the clay gives access to the oozing moisture, we see the\r\nsides bleached, for several feet downwards, to nearly the color of\r\npipe-clay; we find the surface, too, when it has been divested of the\r\nvegetable soil, presenting for yards together the appearance of sheets\r\nof half-bleached linen: the red ground of the clay has been acted upon\r\nby the percolating fluid, as the red ground of a Bandanna handkerchief\r\nis acted upon through the openings in the perforated lead, by the\r\ndischarging chloride of lime. The peculiar chemistry through which these\r\nchanges are effected might be found, carefully studied, to throw much\r\nlight on similar phenomena in the older formations. There are quarries\r\nin the New Red Sandstone in which almost every mass of stone presents a\r\ndifferent shade of color from that of its neighboring mass, and quarries\r\nin the Old Red the strata of which we find streaked and spotted like\r\npieces of calico. And their variegated aspect seems to have been\r\ncommunicated, in every instance, not during deposition, nor after they\r\nhad been hardened into stone but when, like the boulder-clay, they\r\nexisted in an intermediate state. Be it remarked, too, that the red clay\r\nhere,--evidently derived from the abrasion of the red rocks beneath,--is\r\nin dye and composition almost identical with the substance on which, as\r\nan unconsolidated sandstone, the bleaching influences, whatever their\r\ncharacter, had operated in the Palaeozoic period, so many long ages\r\nbefore;--it is a repetition of the ancient experiment in the Old Red,\r\nthat we now see going on in the boulder-clay. It is further worthy of\r\nnotice, that the bleached lines of the clay exhibit, viewed\r\nhorizontally, when the overlying vegetable mould has been removed, and\r\nthe whitened surface in immediate contact with it paired off, a\r\npolygonal arrangement, like that assumed by the cracks in the bottom of\r\nclayey pools dried up in summer by the heat of the sun. Can these\r\npossibly indicate the ancient rents and fissures of the boulder-clay,\r\nformed, immediately after the upheaval of the land, in the first process\r\nof drying, and remaining afterwards open enough to receive what the\r\nuncracked portions of the surface excluded,--the acidulated bleaching\r\nfluid?\r\n\r\nThe kind of ferruginous pavement of the boulder-clay known to the\r\nagriculturist as _pan_, which may be found extending in some cases its\r\niron cover over whole districts,--sealing them down to barrenness, as\r\nthe iron and brass sealed down the stump of Nebuchadnezzar's tree,--is,\r\nlike the white strips and blotches of the deposit, worthy the careful\r\nnotice of the geologist. It serves to throw some light on the origin of\r\nthose continuous bands of clayey or arenaceous ironstone, which in the\r\nolder formations in which vegetable matter abounds, whether Oolitic or\r\nCarboniferous, are of such common occurrence. The _pan_ is a stony\r\nstratum, scarcely less indurated in some localities than sandstone of\r\nthe average hardness, that rests like a pavement on the surface of the\r\nboulder-clay, and that generally bears atop a thin layer of sterile\r\nsoil, darkened by a russet covering of stunted heath. The binding cement\r\nof the _pan_ is, as I have said, ferruginous, and seems to have been\r\nderived from the vegetable covering above. Of all plants, the heaths are\r\nfound to contain most iron. Nor is it difficult to conceive how, in\r\ncomparatively flat tracts of heathy moor, where the surface water sinks\r\nto the stiff subsoil, and on which one generation of plants after\r\nanother has been growing and decaying for many centuries, the minute\r\nmetallic particles, disengaged in the process of decomposition, and\r\ncarried down by the rains to the impermeable clay, should, by\r\naccumulating there, bind the layer on which they rest, as is the nature\r\nof ferruginous oxide, into a continuous stony crust. Wherever this _pan_\r\noccurs, we find the superincumbent soil doomed to barrenness,--arid and\r\nsun-baked during the summer and autumn months, and, from the same cause,\r\novercharged with moisture in winter and spring. My friend Mr. Swanson,\r\nwhen schoolmaster of Nigg, found a large garden attached to the\r\nschool-house so inveterately sterile as to be scarce worth cultivation;\r\na thin stratum of mould rested on a hard impermeable pavement of _pan_,\r\nthrough which not a single root could penetrate to the tenacious but not\r\nunkindly subsoil below. He set himself to work in his leisure hours, and\r\nbit by bit laid bare and broke up the pavement. The upper mould, long\r\ndivorced from the clay on which it had once rested, was again united to\r\nit; the piece of ground began gradually to alter its character for the\r\nbetter; and when I last passed the way, I found it, though in a state of\r\nsad neglect, covered by a richer vegetation than it had ever borne under\r\nthe more careful management of my friend. This ferruginous pavement of\r\nthe boulder-clay may be deemed of interest to the geologist, as a\r\ncurious instance of deposition in a dense medium, and as illustrative\r\nof the changes which may be effected on previously existing strata,\r\nthrough the agency of an overlying vegetation.\r\n\r\nI passed, on my way, through the ancient battle-field to which I have\r\nincidentally referred in the story of the Miller of Resolis.[17] Modern\r\nimprovement has not yet marred it by the plough; and so it still bears\r\non its brown surface many a swelling tumulus and flat oblong mound,\r\nand--where the high road of the district passes along its eastern\r\nedge--the huge gray cairn, raised, says tradition, over the body of an\r\nancient Pictish king. But the contest of which it was the scene belongs\r\nto a profoundly dark period, ere the gray dawn of Scottish history\r\nbegan. As shown by the remains of ancient art occasionally dug up on the\r\nmoor, it was a conflict of the times of the stone battle-axe, the flint\r\narrow-head, and the unglazed sepulchral urn, unindebted for aught of its\r\nsymmetry to the turning-lathe,--times when there were heroes in\r\nabundance, but no scribes. And the cairn, about a hundred feet in length\r\nand breadth, by about twenty in height, with its long hoary hair of\r\novergrown lichen waving in the breeze, and the trailing club-moss\r\nshooting upwards from its base along its sides, bears in its every\r\nlineament full mark of its great age. It is a mound striding across the\r\nstream of centuries, to connect the past with the present. And yet,\r\nafter all, what a mere matter of yesterday its extreme antiquity is! My\r\nexplorations this morning bore reference to but the later eras of the\r\ngeologist; the portion of the geologic volume which I was attempting to\r\ndecipher and translate formed the few terminal paragraphs of its\r\nconcluding chapter. And yet the _finis_ had been added to them for\r\nthousands of years ere this latter antiquity began. The boulder-clay had\r\nbeen formed and deposited; the land, in rising over the waves, had had\r\nmany a huge pebble washed out of its last formed red stratum, or dropped\r\nupon it by ice-floes from above; and these pebbles lay mottling the\r\nsurface of this barren moor for mile after mile, bleaching pale to the\r\nrains and the sun, as the meagre and mossy soil received, in the lapse\r\nof centuries, its slow accessions of organic matter, and darkened around\r\nthem. And then, for a few brief hours, the heath, no longer solitary,\r\nbecame a wild scene of savage warfare,--of waving arms and threatening\r\nfaces,--and of human lives violently spilled, gushing forth in blood;\r\nand, when all was over, the old weathered boulders were heaped up above\r\nthe slain, and there began a new antiquity in relation to the pile in\r\nits gathered state, that bore reference to man's short lifetime, and to\r\nthe recent introduction of the species. The child of a few summers\r\nspeaks of the events of last year as long gone by; while his father\r\nadvanced into middle life, regards them as still fresh and recent.\r\n\r\nI reached the Burn of Killein,--the scene of my purposed\r\nexplorations,--where it bisects the Inverness road; and struck down the\r\nrocky ravine, in the line of the descending strata and the falling\r\nstreamlet, towards the point at which I had crossed it so many years\r\nbefore. First I passed along a thick bed of yellow stone,--next over a\r\nbed of stratified clay. \"The little boy,\" I said, \"took correct note of\r\nwhat he saw, though without special aim at the time, and as much under\r\nthe guidance of a mere observative instinct as Dame Quickly, when she\r\ntook note of the sea-coal fire, the round table, the parcel-gilt goblet,\r\nand goodwife Keech's dish of prawns dressed in vinegar, as adjuncts of\r\nher interview with old Sir John when he promised to marry her. These\r\nare unequivocally the ichthyolitic beds, whether they contain\r\nichthyolites or no.\" The first nodule I laid open presented inside\r\nmerely a pale oblong patch in the centre, which I examined in vain with\r\nthe lens, though convinced of its organic origin, for a single scale.\r\nProceeding farther down the stream, I picked a nodule out of a second\r\nand lower bed, which contained more evidently its organism,--a\r\nfinely-reticulated fragment, that at first sight reminded me of some\r\ndelicate festinella of the Silurian system. It proved, however, to be\r\npart of the tail of a Cheiracanthus, exhibiting--what is rarely\r\nshown--the interior surfaces of those minute rectangular scales which in\r\nthis genus lie over the caudal fin, ranged in right lines. A second\r\nnodule presented me with the spines of _Diplacanthus striatus_; and\r\nstill farther down the stream,--for the beds are numerous here, and\r\noccupy in vertical extent very considerable space in the system,--I\r\ndetected a stratum of bulky nodules charged with fragments of\r\nCoccosteus, belonging chiefly to two species,--_Coccosteus decipiens_\r\nand _Coccosteus cuspidatus_. All the specimens bore conclusive evidence\r\nregarding the geologic place and character of the beds in which they\r\noccur; and in one of the number, a specimen of _Coccosteus decipiens_,\r\nsufficiently fine to be transferred to my knapsack, and which now\r\noccupies its corner in my little collection, the head exhibits all its\r\nplates in their proper order, and the large dorsal plate, though\r\ndissociated from the nail-like attachment of the nape, presents its\r\ncharacteristic breadth entire. It was the plates of this species, first\r\nfound in the flagstones of Caithness, which were taken for those of a\r\nfresh-water tortoise; and hence apparently its specific name,\r\n_decipiens_;--it is the _deceiving_ Coccosteus. I disinterred, in the\r\ncourse of my explorations, as many nodules as lay within reach,--now and\r\nthen longing for a pickaxe, and a companion robust and persevering\r\nenough to employ it with effect; and after seeing all that was to be\r\nseen in the bed of the stream and the precipices, I retraced my steps up\r\nthe dell to the highway. And then, striking off across the moor to the\r\nnorth,--ascending in the system as I climbed the eminence, which forms\r\nhere the central ridge of the old Maolbuie Common,--I spent some little\r\ntime in a quarry of pale red sandstone, known, from the moory height on\r\nwhich it has been opened, as the quarry of the Maolbuie. But here, as\r\nelsewhere, the folds of that upper division of the Lower Old Red in\r\nwhich it has been excavated contain nothing organic. Why this should be\r\nso universally the case,--for in Caithness, Orkney, Cromarty, and Ross,\r\nwherever, in short, this member of the system is unequivocally\r\ndeveloped, it is invariably barren of remains,--cannot, I suspect, be\r\nvery satisfactorily explained. Fossils occur both over and under it, in\r\nrocks that seem as little favorable to their preservation; but during\r\nthat intervening period which its blank strata represent, at least the\r\n_species_ of all the ichthyolites of the system seem to have changed,\r\nand, so far as is yet known, the _genus_ Coccosteus died out entirely.\r\n\r\nThe Black Isle has been elaborately described in the last Statistical\r\nAccount of the Parish of Avoch as comprising at least the analogues of\r\nthree vast geologic systems. The Great Conglomerate, and the thick bed\r\nof coarse sandstone of corresponding character that lies over it,\r\ncompose all which is not primary rock of that south-eastern ridge of the\r\ndistrict which forms the shores of the Moray Frith; and _they_ are\r\nrepresented in the Account as Old Red Sandstone proper. Then, next in\r\norder,--forming the base of a parallel ridge,--come those sandstone and\r\nargillaceous bands to which the ichthyolite beds belong; and these\r\nthough at the time the work appeared their existence in the locality\r\ncould be but guessed at, are described as representatives of the Coal\r\nMeasures. Last of all there occur those superior sandstones of the Lower\r\nOld Red formation in which the quarry of the Maolbuie has been opened,\r\nand which are largely developed in the central or _backbone_ ridge of\r\nthe district. \"And these,\" says the writer, \"we have little hesitation\r\nin assigning to the _New_ Red, or variegated Sandstone formation.\" I\r\nremember that some thirteen years ago,--in part misled by authority, and\r\nin part really afraid to represent beds of such an enormous aggregate\r\nthickness as all belonging to one inconsiderable formation,--for such\r\nwas the character of the Old Red Sandstone at the time,--I ventured,\r\nthough hesitatingly, and with less of detail, on a somewhat similar\r\nstatement regarding the sandstone deposits of the parish of Cromarty.\r\nBut true it is, notwithstanding, that the stratified rocks of the Black\r\nIsle are composed generally, not of the analogues of three systems, but\r\nof merely a fractional portion of a single system,--a fact previously\r\nestablished in other parts of the district, and which my discovery of\r\nthis day in the Burn of Killein served yet farther to confirm in\r\nrelation to that middle portion of the tract in which the parish of\r\nAvoch is situated. The geologic records, unlike the Sybilline books,\r\ngrow in volume and number as one pauses and hesitates over them;\r\ndemanding, however, with every addition to their bulk, a larger and yet\r\nlarger sum of epochs and of ages.\r\n\r\nThe sun had got low in the western sky, and I had at least some eight or\r\nnine miles of rough road still before me; but the day had been a happy\r\nand not unsuccessful one, and so its hard work had failed to fatigue.\r\nThe shadows, however, were falling brown and deep on the bleak Maolbuie,\r\nas I passed, on my return, the solitary cairn; and it was dark night\r\nlong ere I reached Cromarty. Next morning I quitted the town for the\r\nupper reaches of the Frith, to examine yet further the superficial\r\ndeposits and travelled boulders of the district.\r\n\r\nI landed at Invergordon a little after noon, from the Leith steamer,\r\nthat, on its way to the upper ports of the Moray and Dingwall Friths,\r\nstops at Cromarty for passengers every Wednesday; and then passing\r\ndirect through the village, I took the western road which winds along\r\nthe shore towards Strathpeffer, skirting on the right the ancient\r\nprovince of the Munroes. The day was clear and genial; and the\r\nwide-spreading woods of this part of the country, a little touched by\r\ntheir autumnal tints of brown and yellow, gave a warmth of hue to the\r\nlandscape, which at an earlier season it wanted. A few slim streaks of\r\nsemi-transparent mist, that barred the distant hill-peaks, and a few\r\ntowering piles of intensely white cloud, that shot across the deep blue\r\nof the heavens, gave warning that the earlier part of the day was to be\r\nin all probability the better part of it, and that the harvest of\r\nobservation which it was ultimately to yield might be found to depend on\r\nthe prompt use made of the passing hour. What first attracts the\r\nattention of the geologist, in journeying westwards, is the altered\r\ncolor of the boulder-clay, as exhibited in ditches by the way-side, or\r\nalong the shore. It no longer presents that characteristic red\r\ntint,--borrowed from the red sandstone beneath,--so prevalent over the\r\nBlack Isle, and in Easter Ross generally; but is of a cold leaden hue,\r\nnot unlike that which it wears above the Coal Measures of the south, or\r\nover the flagstones of Caithness. The altered color here is evidently a\r\nconsequence of the large development, in Ferindonald and Strathpeffer,\r\nof the ichthyolitic members of the Old Red, existing chiefly as fetid\r\nbituminous breccias and dark-colored sandstones: the boulder-clay of\r\nthe locality forms the dressings, not of red, but of blackish-gray\r\nrocks; and, as almost everywhere else in Scotland, its trail lies to the\r\neast of the strata, from which it was detached in the character of an\r\nimpalpable mud by the age-protracted grindings of the denuding agent. It\r\nabounds in masses of bituminous breccia, some of which, of great size,\r\nseem to have been drifted direct from the valley of Strathpeffer, and\r\nare identical in structure and composition with the rock in which the\r\nmineral springs of the Strath have their rise, and to which they owe\r\ntheir peculiar qualities.\r\n\r\nAfter walking on for about eight miles, through noble woods and a lovely\r\ncountry, I struck from off the high road at the pretty little village of\r\nEvanton, and pursued the course of the river Auldgrande, first through\r\nintermingled fields and patches of copsewood, and then through a thick\r\nfir wood, to where the bed of the stream contracts from a\r\nboulder-strewed bottom of ample breadth, to a gloomy fissure, so deep\r\nand dark, that in many places the water cannot be seen, and so narrow,\r\nthat the trees which shoot out from the opposite sides interlace their\r\nbranches atop. Large banks of the gray boulder-clay, laid open by the\r\nriver, and charged with fragments of dingy sandstone and dark-colored\r\nbreccia, testify, along the lower reaches of the stream, to the near\r\nneighborhood of the ichthyolitic member of the Old Red; but where the\r\nbanks contract, we find only its lowest member, the Great Conglomerate.\r\nThis last is by far the most picturesque member of the system,--abrupt\r\nand bold of outline in its hills, and mural in its precipices. And\r\nnowhere does it exhibit a wilder or more characteristic beauty than at\r\nthe tall narrow portal of the Auldgrande, where the river,--after\r\nwailing for miles in a pent-up channel, narrow as one of the lanes of\r\nold Edinburgh, and hemmed in by walls quite as perpendicular, and\r\nnearly twice as lofty,--suddenly expands, first into a deep brown pool,\r\nand then into a broad tumbling stream, that, as if permanently affected\r\nin temper by the strict severity of the discipline to which its early\r\nlife had been subjected, frets and chafes in all its after course, till\r\nit loses itself in the sea. The banks, ere we reach the opening of the\r\nchasm, have become steep, and wild, and densely wooded; and there stand\r\nout on either hand, giant crags, that plant their iron feet in the\r\nstream; here girdled with belts of rank succulent shrubs, that love the\r\ndamp shade and the frequent drizzle of the spray; and there hollow and\r\nbare, with their round pebbles sticking out from the partially\r\ndecomposed surface, like the piled-up skulls in the great underground\r\ncemetery of the Parisians. Massy trees, with their green fantastic roots\r\nrising high over the scanty soil, and forming many a labyrinthine recess\r\nfor the frog, the toad, and the newt, stretch forth their gnarled arms\r\nathwart the stream. In front of the opening, with but a black deep pool\r\nbetween, there lies a midway bank of huge stones. Of these, not a few of\r\nthe more angular masses still bear, though sorely worn by the torrent,\r\nthe mark of the blasting iron, and were evidently tumbled into the chasm\r\nfrom the fields above. But in the chasm there was no rest for them, and\r\nso the arrowy rush of the water in the confined channel swept them down\r\ntill they dropped where they now lie, just where the widening bottom\r\nfirst served to dissipate the force of the current. And over the sullen\r\npool in front we may see the stern pillars of the portal rising from\r\neighty to a hundred feet in height, and scarce twelve feet apart, like\r\nthe massive obelisks of some Egyptian temple; while, in gloomy vista\r\nwithin, projection starts out beyond projection, like column beyond\r\ncolumn in some narrow avenue of approach to Luxor or Carnac. The\r\nprecipices are green, with some moss or byssus, that like the miner,\r\nchooses a subterranean habitat,--for here the rays of the sun never\r\nfall; the dead, mossy water beneath, from which the cliffs rise so\r\nabruptly, bears the hue of molten pitch; the trees, fast anchored in the\r\nrock, shoot out their branches across the opening, to form a thick\r\ntangled roof, at the height of a hundred and fifty feet overhead; while\r\nfrom the recesses within, where the eye fails to penetrate, there issues\r\na combination of the strangest and wildest sounds ever yet produced by\r\nwater: there is the deafening rush of the torrent, blent as if with the\r\nclang of hammers, the roar of vast bellows, and the confused gabble of a\r\nthousand voices. The sun, hastening to its setting, shone red, yet\r\nmellow, through the foliage of the wooded banks on the west, where, high\r\nabove, they first curve from the sloping level of the fields, to bend\r\nover the stream; or fell more direct on the jutting cliffs and bosky\r\ndingles opposite, burnishing them as if with gold and fire; but all was\r\ncoldly-hued at the bottom, where the torrent foamed gray and chill under\r\nthe brown shadow of the banks; and where the narrow portal opened an\r\nuntrodden way into the mysterious recesses beyond, the shadow deepened\r\nalmost into blackness. The scene lacked but a ghost to render it\r\nperfect. An apparition walking from within like the genius in one of\r\nGoldsmith's essays \"along the surface of the water,\" would have\r\ncompleted it at once.\r\n\r\nLaying hold of an overhanging branch, I warped myself upwards from the\r\nbed of the stream along the face of a precipice, and, reaching its\r\nsloping top, forced my way to the wood above, over a steep bank covered\r\nwith tangled underwood, and a slim succulent herbage, that sickened for\r\nwant of the sun. The yellow light was streaming through many a shaggy\r\nvista, as, threading my way along the narrow ravine as near the steep\r\nedge as the brokenness of the ground permitted, I reached a huge mass\r\nof travelled rock, that had been dropped in the old boulder period\r\nwithin a yard's length of the brink. It is composed of a characteristic\r\ngranitic gneiss of a pale flesh-color, streaked with black, that, in the\r\nhand specimen, can scarce be distinguished from a true granite, but\r\nwhich, viewed in the mass, presents, in the arrangement of its intensely\r\ndark mica, evident marks of stratification, and which is remarkable,\r\namong other things, for furnishing almost all the very large boulders of\r\nthis part of the country. Unlike many of the granitic gneisses, it is a\r\nfine solid stone, and would cut well. When I had last the pleasure of\r\nspending a few hours with the late Mr. William Laidlaw, the trusted\r\nfriend of Sir Walter Scott, he intimated to me his intention,--pointing\r\nto a boulder of this species of gneiss,--of having it cut into two\r\noblong pedestals, with which he purposed flanking the entrance to the\r\nmansion-house of the chief of the Rosses,--the gentleman whose property\r\nhe at that time superintended. It was, he said, both in appearance and\r\nhistory, the most remarkable stone on the lands of Balnagown; and so he\r\nwas desirous that it should be exhibited at Balnagown Castle to the best\r\nadvantage. But as he fell shortly after into infirm health, and resigned\r\nhis situation, I know not that he ever carried his purpose into effect.\r\nThe boulder here, beside the chasm, measures about twelve feet in length\r\nand breadth, by from five to six in height, and contains from eight to\r\nnine hundred cubic feet of stone. On its upper table-like surface I\r\nfound a few patches of moss and lichen, and a slim reddening tuft of the\r\n_Vaccinium myrtillus_, still bearing, late as was the season, its\r\nhalf-dozen blaeberries. This pretty little plant occurs in great\r\nprofusion along the steep edges of the Auldgrande, where its delicate\r\nbushes, springing up amid long heath and ling, and crimsoned by the\r\nautumnal tinge, gave a peculiar warmth and richness this evening to\r\nthose bosky spots under the brown trees, or in immediate contact with\r\nthe dark chasm on which the sunlight fell most strongly; and on all the\r\nmore perilous projections, I found the dark berries still shrivelling on\r\ntheir stems. Thirty years earlier I would scarce have left them there;\r\nand the more perilous the crag on which they had grown, the more\r\ndeliciously would they have eaten. But every period of life has its own\r\nplaythings; and I was now chiefly engaged with the deep chasm and the\r\nhuge boulder. Chasm and boulder had come to have greatly more of\r\ninterest to me than the delicate berries, or than even that sovereign\r\ndispeller of ennui and low spirits, an adventurous scramble among the\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nIn what state did the chasm exist when the huge boulder,--detached,\r\nmayhap, at the close of a severe frost, from some island of the\r\narchipelago that is now the northern Highlands of Scotland,--was\r\nsuffered to drop beside it, from some vast ice-floe drifting eastwards\r\non the tide? In all probability merely as a fault in the Conglomerate,\r\nsimilar to many of those faults which in the Coal Measures of the\r\nsouthern districts we find occupied by continuous dikes of trap. But in\r\nthis northern region, where the trap-rocks are unknown, it must have\r\nbeen filled up with the boulder-clay, or with some still more ancient\r\naccumulation of debris. And when the land had risen, and the streams,\r\nswollen into rivers, flowed along the hollows which they now occupy, the\r\nloose rubbish would in the lapse of ages gradually wash downwards to the\r\nsea, as the stones thrown from the fields above were washed downwards in\r\na later time; and thus the deep fissure would ultimately be cleared out.\r\nThe boulder-stones lie thickly in this neighborhood, and over the\r\neastern half of Ross-shire, and the Black Isle generally; though for\r\nthe last century they have been gradually disappearing from the more\r\ncultivated tracts on which there were fences or farm-steadings to be\r\nbuilt, or where they obstructed the course of the plough. We found them\r\noccurring in every conceivable situation,--high on hill-sides, where the\r\nshepherd crouches beside them for shelter in a shower,--deep in the open\r\nsea, where they entangle the nets of the fisherman,--on inland moors,\r\nwhere in some remote age they were painfully rolled together, to form\r\nthe Druidical circle or Picts'-house,--or on the margin of the coast,\r\nwhere they had been piled over one another at a later time, as\r\nprotecting bulwarks against the encroachments of the waves. They lie\r\nstrewed more sparingly over extended plains, or on exposed heights, than\r\nin hollows sheltered from the west by high land, where the current, when\r\nit dashed high on the hill-sides, must have been diverted from its\r\neasterly course, and revolved in whirling eddies. On the top of the fine\r\nbluff hill of Fyrish, which I so admired to-day, each time I caught a\r\nglimpse of its purple front through the woods, and which shows how noble\r\na mountain the Old Red Sandstone may produce, the boulders lie but\r\nsparsely. I especially marked, however, when last on its summit, a\r\nponderous traveller of a vividly green hornblende, resting on a bed of\r\npale yellow sandstone, fully a thousand feet over the present high-water\r\nlevel. But towards the east, in what a seaman would term the _bight_ of\r\nthe hill, the boulders have accumulated in vast numbers. They lie so\r\nclosely piled along the course of the river Alness, about half a mile\r\nabove the village, that it is with difficulty the waters, when in flood,\r\ncan force their passage through. For here, apparently, when the tide\r\nswept along the hill-side, many an ice-floe, detained in the shelter by\r\nthe revolving eddy, dashed together in rude collision, and shook their\r\nstony burdens to the bottom. Immediately to the east of the low\r\npromontory on which the town of Cromarty is built there is another\r\nextensive accumulation of boulders, some of them of great size. They\r\noccupy exactly the place to which I have oftener than once seen the\r\ndrift-ice of the upper part of the Cromarty Frith, set loose by a thaw,\r\nand then carried seawards by the retreating tide, forced back by a\r\nviolent storm from, the east, and the fragments ground against each\r\nother into powder. And here, I doubt not, of old, when the sea stood\r\ngreatly higher than now, and the ice-floes were immensely larger and\r\nmore numerous than those formed, in the existing circumstances, in the\r\nupper shallows of the Frith, would the fierce north-east have charged\r\nhome with similar effect, and the broken masses have divested themselves\r\nof their boulders.\r\n\r\nThe Highland chieftain of one of our old Gaelic traditions conversed\r\nwith a boulder-stone, and told to it the story which he had sworn never\r\nto tell to man. I too, after a sort, have conversed with boulder-stones,\r\nnot, however, to tell them any story of mine, but to urge them to tell\r\ntheirs to me. But, lacking the fine ear of Hans Anderson, the Danish\r\npoet, who can hear flowers and butterflies talk, and understand the\r\nlanguage of birds, I have as yet succeeded in extracting from them no\r\nsuch articulate reply\r\n\r\n \"As Memnon's image, long renowned of old\r\n By fabling Nilus, to the quivering touch\r\n Of Titan's ray, with each repulsive string\r\n Consenting, sounded through the warbling air.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, who can doubt that, were they a little more communicative,\r\ntheir stories of movement in the past, with the additional circumstances\r\nconnected with the places which they have occupied ever since they gave\r\nover travelling, would be exceedingly curious ones? Among the boulder\r\ngroup to the east of Cromarty, the most ponderous individual stands so\r\nexactly on the low-water line of our great Lammas tides, that though its\r\nshoreward edge may be reached dry-shod from four to six times every\r\ntwelvemonth, no one has ever succeeded in walking dry shod round it. I\r\nhave seen a strong breeze from the west, prolonged for a few days,\r\nprevent its drying, when the Lammas stream was at its point of lowest\r\nebb, by from a foot to eighteen inches,--an indication, apparently, that\r\nto that height the waters of the Atlantic may be heaped up against our\r\nshores by the impulsion of the wind. And the recurrence, during at least\r\nthe last century, of certain ebbs each season, which, when no disturbing\r\natmospheric phenomena interfere with their operation, are sure to lay it\r\ndry, demonstrate, that during that period no change, even the most\r\nminute, has taken place on our coasts, in the relative levels of sea and\r\nshore. The waves have considerably encroached, during even the last\r\nhalf-century, on the shores immediately opposite; but it must have been,\r\nas the stone shows, simply by the attrition of the waves, and the\r\nconsequent lowering of the beach,--not through any rise in the ocean, or\r\nany depression of the land.\r\n\r\nThe huge boulder here has been known for ages as the _Clach Malloch_, or\r\naccursed stone, from the circumstance, says tradition, that a boat was\r\nonce wrecked upon it during a storm, and the boatmen drowned. Though\r\nlittle more than seven feet in height, by about twelve in length, and\r\nsome eight or nine in breadth, its situation on the extreme line of ebb\r\nimparts a peculiar character to the various productions, animal and\r\nvegetable, which we find adhering to it. They occur in zones, just as on\r\nlofty hills the botanist finds his agricultural, moorland, and alpine\r\nzones rising in succession as he ascends, the one over the other. At its\r\nbase, where the tide rarely falls, we find two varieties of _Lobularia\r\ndigitata_, dead man's hand, the orange colored and the pale, with a\r\nspecies of sertularia; and the characteristic vegetable is the\r\nrough-stemmed tangle, or cuvy. In the zone immediately above the lowest,\r\nthese productions disappear; the characteristic animal, if animal it be,\r\nis a flat yellow sponge,--the _Halichondria papillaris_,--remarkable\r\nchiefly for its sharp siliceous spicula and its strong phosphoric smell;\r\nand the characteristic vegetable is the smooth-stemmed tangle, or\r\nqueener. In yet another zone we find the common limpet and the vesicular\r\nkelp-weed; and the small gray balanus and serrated kelp-weed form the\r\nproductions of the top. We may see exactly the same zones occurring in\r\nbroad belts along the shore,--each zone indicative of a certain\r\noverlying depth of water; but it seems curious enough to find them all\r\nexisting in succession on one boulder. Of the boulder and its story,\r\nhowever, more in my next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     Imaginary Autobiography of the _Clach Malloch_ Boulder--Its\r\n     Creation--Its long night of unsummed Centuries--Laid open to light\r\n     on a desert Island--Surrounded by an Arctic Vegetation--Undermined\r\n     by the rising Sea--Locked up and floated off on an Ice-field--At\r\n     rest on the Sea-bottom--Another Night of unsummed Years--The\r\n     Boulder raised again above the waves by the rising of the\r\n     Land--Beholds an altered Country--Pine Forests and Mammals--Another\r\n     Period of Ages passes--The Boulder again floated off by an\r\n     Iceberg--Finally at rest on the Shore of Cromarty Bay--Time and\r\n     Occasion of naming it--Strange Phenomena accounted for by\r\n     Earthquakes--How the Boulder of Petty Bay was moved--The Boulder of\r\n     Auldgrande--The old Highland Paupers--The little Parsi Girl--Her\r\n     Letter to her Papa--But one Human Nature on Earth--Journey\r\n     resumed--Conon Burying Ground--An aged Couple--Gossip.\r\n\r\nThe natural, and, if I may so speak, topographical, history of the\r\n_Clach Malloch_,--including, of course, its zoology and botany, with\r\nnotes of those atmospheric effects on the tides, and of that stability\r\nfor ages of the existing sea-level, which it indicates,--would of itself\r\nform one very interesting chapter: its geological history would furnish\r\nanother. It would probably tell, if it once fairly broke silence and\r\nbecame autobiographical, first of a feverish dream of intense molten\r\nheat and overpowering pressure; and then of a busy time, in which the\r\nfree molecules, as at once the materials and the artisans of the mass,\r\nbegan to build, each according to its nature, under the superintendence\r\nof a curious chemistry,--here forming sheets of black mica, there rhombs\r\nof a dark-green hornblende and a flesh-colored feldspar, yonder\r\namorphous masses of a translucent quartz. It would add further, that at\r\nlength, when the slow process was over, and the entire space had been\r\noccupied to the full by plate, molecule, and crystal, the red fiery\r\ntwilight of the dream deepened into more than midnight gloom, and a\r\nchill unconscious night descended on the sleeper. The vast Palaeozoic\r\nperiod passes by,--the scarce less protracted Secondary ages come to a\r\nclose,--the Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene epochs are ushered in and\r\nterminate,--races begin and end,--families and orders are born and die;\r\nbut the dead, or those whose deep slumber admits not of dreams, take no\r\nnote of time; and so it would tell how its long night of unsummed\r\ncenturies seemed, like the long night of the grave, compressed into a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe marble silence is suddenly broken by the rush of an avalanche, that\r\ntears away the superincumbent masses, rolling them into the sea; and the\r\nponderous block, laid open to the light, finds itself on the bleak shore\r\nof a desert island of the northern Scottish archipelago, with a wintry\r\nscene of snow-covered peaks behind, and an ice-mottled ocean before. The\r\nwinter passes, the cold severe spring comes on, and day after day the\r\nfield-ice goes floating by,--now gray in shadow, now bright in the sun.\r\nAt length vegetation, long repressed, bursts forth, but in no profuse\r\nluxuriance. A few dwarf birches unfold their leaves amid the rocks; a\r\nfew sub-arctic willows hang out their catkins beside the swampy runnels;\r\nthe golden potentilla opens its bright flowers on slopes where the\r\nevergreen _Empetrum nigrum_ slowly ripens its glossy crow-berries; and\r\nfrom where the sea-spray dashes at full tide along the beach, to where\r\nthe snow gleams at midsummer on the mountain-summits, the thin short\r\nsward is dotted by the minute cruciform stars of the scurvy-grass, and\r\nthe crimson blossoms of the sea-pink. Not a few of the plants of our\r\nexisting sea-shores and of our loftier hill-tops are still identical in\r\nspecies; but wide zones of rich herbage, with many a fertile field and\r\nmany a stately tree, intervene between the bare marine belts and the\r\nbleak insulated eminences; and thus the alpine, notwithstanding its\r\nidentity with the littoral flora, has been long divorced from it; but in\r\nthis early time the divorce had not yet taken place, nor for ages\r\nthereafter; and the same plants that sprang around the sea-margin rose\r\nalso along the middle slopes to the mountain-summits. The landscape is\r\ntreeless and bare, and a hoary lichen whitens the moors, and waves, as\r\nthe years pass by, in pale tufts, from the disinterred stone, now\r\ncovered with weather-stains, green and gray, and standing out in bold\r\nand yet bolder relief from the steep hill-side as the pulverizing frosts\r\nand washing rains bear away the lesser masses from around it. The sea is\r\nslowly rising, and the land, in proportion, narrowing its flatter\r\nmargins, and yielding up its wider valleys to the tide; the low green\r\nisland of one century forms the half-tide skerry, darkened with algae, of\r\nanother, and in yet a third exists but as a deep-sea rock. As its summit\r\ndisappears, groups of hills, detached from the land, become islands,\r\nskerries, deep-sea rocks, in turn. At length the waves at full wash\r\nwithin a few yards of the granitic block. And now, yielding to the\r\nundermining influences, just as a blinding snow-shower is darkening the\r\nheavens, it comes thundering down the steep into the sea, where it lies\r\nimmediately beneath the high-water line, surrounded by a wide float of\r\npulverized ice, broken by the waves. A keen frost sets in; the\r\nhalf-fluid mass around is bound up for many acres into a solid raft,\r\nthat clasps fast in its rigid embrace the rocky fragment; a stream-tide,\r\nheightened by a strong gale from the west, rises high on the beach; the\r\nconsolidated ice-field moves, floats, is detached from the shore, creeps\r\nslowly outwards into the offing, bearing atop the boulder; and,\r\nfinally, caught by the easterly current, it drifts away into the open\r\nocean. And then, far from its original bed in the rock, amid the\r\njerkings of a cockling sea, the mass breaks through the supporting\r\nfloat, and settles far beneath, amid the green and silent twilight of\r\nthe bottom, where its mosses and lichens yield their place to stony\r\nencrustations of deep purple, and to miniature thickets of arboraceous\r\nzoophites.\r\n\r\nThe many-colored Acalephae float by; the many-armed Sepiadae shoot over;\r\nwhile shells that love the profounder depths,--the black Modiola and\r\ndelicate Anomia,--anchor along the sides of the mass; and where thickets\r\nof the deep-sea tangle spread out their long, streamer-like fronds to\r\nthe tide, the strong Cyprina and many-ribbed Astarte shelter by scores\r\namid the reticulations of the short woody stems and thick-set roots. A\r\nsudden darkness comes on, like that which fell upon Sinbad when the\r\ngigantic roc descended upon him; the sea-surface is fully sixty fathoms\r\nover head; but even at this great depth an enormous iceberg grates\r\nheavily against the bottom, crushing into fragments in its course,\r\nCyprina, Modiola, Astarte, with many a hapless mollusc besides; and\r\nfurrows into deep grooves the very rocks on which they lie. It passes\r\naway; and, after many an unsummed year has also passed, there comes\r\nanother change. The period of depression and of the boulder-clay is\r\nover. The water has shallowed as the sea-line gradually sank, or the\r\nland was propelled upwards by some elevatory process from below; and\r\neach time the tide falls, the huge boulder now raises over the waters\r\nits broad forehead, already hung round with flowing tresses of brown\r\nsea-weed, and looks at the adjacent coast. The country has strangely\r\naltered its features: it exists no longer as a broken archipelago,\r\nscantily covered by a semi-arctic vegetation, but as a continuous land,\r\nstill whitened, where the great valleys open to the sea, by the pale\r\ngleam of local glaciers, and snow-streaked on its loftier hill-tops. But\r\nvast forests of dark pine sweep along its hill-sides or selvage its\r\nshores; and the sheltered hollows are enlivened by the lighter green of\r\nthe oak, the ash, and the elm. Human foot has not yet imprinted its\r\nsward; but its brute inhabitants have become numerous. The cream-colored\r\ncoat of the wild bull,--a speck of white relieved against a ground of\r\ndingy green,--may be seen far amid the pines, and the long howl of the\r\nwolf heard from the nearer thickets. The gigantic elk raises himself\r\nfrom his lair, and tosses his ponderous horns at the sound; while the\r\nbeaver, in some sequestered dell traversed by a streamlet, plunges\r\nalarmed into his deep coffer-dam, and, rising through the submerged\r\nopening of his cell, shelters safely within, beyond reach of pursuit.\r\nThe great transverse valleys of the country, from its eastern to its\r\nwestern coasts, are still occupied by the sea,--they exist as broad\r\nocean-sounds; and many of the detached hills rise around its shores as\r\nislands. The northern Sutor forms a bluff high island, for the plains of\r\nEaster Ross are still submerged; and the Black Isle is in reality what\r\nin later times it is merely in name,--a sea-encircled district, holding\r\na midway place between where the Sound of the great Caledonian Valley\r\nand the Sounds of the Valleys of the Conon and Carron open into the\r\nGerman Ocean. Though the climate has greatly softened, it is still, as\r\nthe local glaciers testify, ungenial and severe. Winter protracts his\r\nstay through the later months of spring; and still, as of old, vast\r\nfloats of ice, detached from the glaciers, or formed in the lakes and\r\nshallower estuaries of the interior, come drifting down the Sounds every\r\nseason, and disappear in the open sea, or lie stranded along the shores.\r\n\r\nAges have again passed: the huge boulder, from the further sinking of\r\nthe waters, lies dry throughout the neaps, and is covered only at the\r\nheight of each stream-tide; there is a float of ice stranded on the\r\nbeach, which consolidates around it during the neap, and is floated off\r\nby the stream; and the boulder, borne in its midst, as of old, again\r\nsets out a voyaging. It has reached the narrow opening of the Sutors,\r\nswept downwards by the strong ebb current, when a violent storm from the\r\nnorth-east sets in; and, constrained by antagonist forces,--the sweep of\r\nthe tide on the one hand, and the roll of the waves on the other,--the\r\nice-raft deflects into the little bay that lies to the east of the\r\npromontory now occupied by the town of Cromarty. And there it tosses,\r\nwith a hundred more jostling in rude collision; and at length bursting\r\napart, the _Clach Malloch_, its journeyings forever over, settles on its\r\nfinal resting-place. In a period long posterior it saw the ultimate\r\nelevation of the land. Who shall dare say how much more it witnessed, or\r\ndecide that it did not form the centre of a rich forest vegetation, and\r\nthat the ivy did not cling round it, and the wild rose shed its petals\r\nover it, when the Dingwall, Moray, and Dornoch Friths existed as\r\nsub-aerial valleys, traversed by streams that now enter the sea far\r\napart, but then gathered themselves into one vast river, that, after it\r\nhad received the tributary waters of the Shin and the Conon, the Ness\r\nand the Beauly, the Helmsdale, the Brora, the Findhorn, and the Spey,\r\nrolled on through the flat secondary formations of the outer Moray\r\nFrith,--Lias, and Oolite, and Greensand, and Chalk,--to fall into a gulf\r\nof the Northern Ocean which intervened between the coasts of Scotland\r\nand Norway, but closed nearly opposite the mouth of the Tyne, leaving a\r\nbroad level plain to connect the coasts of England with those of the\r\nContinent! Be this as it may, the present sea-coast became at length the\r\ncommon boundary of land and sea. And the boulder continued to exist for\r\ncenturies still later as a nameless stone, on which the tall gray heron\r\nrested moveless and ghost-like in the evenings, and the seal at mid-day\r\nbasked lazily in the sun. And then there came a night of fierce tempest,\r\nin which the agonizing cry of drowning men was heard along the shore.\r\nWhen the morning broke, there lay strewed around a few bloated corpses,\r\nand the fragments of a broken wreck; and amid wild execrations and loud\r\nsorrow the boulder received its name. Such is the probable history,\r\nbriefly told, because touched at merely a few detached points, of the\r\nhuge _Clach Malloch_. The incident of the second voyage here is of\r\ncourse altogether imaginary, in relation to at least this special\r\nboulder; but it is to second voyages only that all our positive evidence\r\ntestifies in the history of its class. The boulders of the St. Lawrence,\r\nso well described by Sir Charles Lyell, voyage by thousands every\r\nyear;[18] and there are few of my northern readers who have not heard of\r\nthe short trip taken nearly half a century ago by the boulder of Petty\r\nBay, in the neighborhood of Culloden.\r\n\r\nA Highland minister of the last century, in describing, for Sir John\r\nSinclair's Statistical Account, a large sepulchral cairn in his parish,\r\nattributed its formation to an _earthquake_! Earthquakes, in these\r\nlatter times, are introduced, like the heathen gods of old, to bring\r\nauthors out of difficulties. I do not think, however,--and I have the\r\nauthority of the old critic for at least half the opinion,--that either\r\ngods or earthquakes should be resorted to by poets or geologists,\r\nwithout special occasion: they ought never to be called in except as a\r\nlast resort, when there is no way of getting on without them. And I am\r\nafraid there have been few more gratuitous invocations of the earthquake\r\nthan on a certain occasion, some five years ago, when it was employed by\r\nthe inmate of a north-country manse, at once to account for the removal\r\nof the boulder-stone of Petty Bay, and to annihilate at a blow the\r\ngeology of the Free Church editor of the _Witness_. I had briefly stated\r\nin one of my papers, in referring to this curious incident, that the\r\nboulder of the bay had been \"borne nearly three hundred yards outwards\r\ninto the sea by an enclasping mass of ice, in the course of a single\r\ntide.\" \"Not at all,\" said the northern clergyman; \"the cause assigned is\r\nwholly insufficient to produce such an effect. All the ice ever formed\r\nin the bay would be insufficient to remove such a boulder a distance,\r\nnot of three hundred, but even of _three_ yards.\" The removal of the\r\nstone \"_is referrible to an_ EARTHQUAKE!\" The country, it would seem,\r\ntook a sudden lurch, and the stone tumbled off. It fell athwart the flat\r\nsurface of the bay, as a soup tureen sometimes falls athwart the table\r\nof a storm-beset steamer, vastly to the discomfort of the passengers,\r\nand again caught the ground as the land righted. Ingenious, certainly!\r\nIt does appear a little wonderful, however, that in a shock so\r\ntremendous nothing should have fallen off except the stone. In an\r\nearthquake on an equally great scale, in the present unsettled state of\r\nsociety, endowed clergymen would, I am afraid, be in some danger of\r\nfalling out of their charges.\r\n\r\nThe boulder beside the Auldgrande has not only, like the _Clach\r\nMalloch_, a geologic history of its own, but, what some may deem of\r\nperhaps equal authority, a _mythologic_ history also. The inaccessible\r\nchasm, impervious to the sun, and ever resounding the wild howl of the\r\ntortured water, was too remarkable an object to have escaped the notice\r\nof the old imaginative Celts; and they have married it, as was their\r\nwont, to a set of stories quite as wild as itself. And the boulder,\r\noccupying a nearly central position in its course, just where the dell\r\nis deepest, and narrowest, and blackest, and where the stream bellows\r\nfar underground in its wildest combination of tones, marks out the spot\r\nwhere the more extraordinary incidents have happened, and the stranger\r\nsights have been seen. Immediately beside the stone there is what seems\r\nto be the beginning of a path leading down to the water; but it stops\r\nabruptly at a tree,--the last in the descent,--and the green and dewy\r\nrock sinks beyond for more than a hundred feet, perpendicular as a wall.\r\nIt was at the abrupt termination of this path that a Highlander once saw\r\na beautiful child smiling and stretching out its little hand to him, as\r\nit hung half in air by a slender twig. But he well knew that it was no\r\nchild, but an evil spirit, and that if he gave it the assistance which\r\nit seemed to crave, he would be pulled headlong into the chasm, and\r\nnever heard of more. And the boulder still bears, it is said, on its\r\nside,--though I failed this evening to detect the mark,--the stamp,\r\nstrangely impressed, of the household keys of Balconie.[19]\r\n\r\nThe sun had now got as low upon the hill, and the ravine had grown as\r\ndark, as when, so long before, the lady of Balconie took her last walk\r\nalong the sides of the Auldgrande; and I struck up for the little alpine\r\nbridge of a few undressed logs, which has been here thrown across the\r\nchasm, at the height of a hundred and thirty feet over the water. As I\r\npressed through the thick underwood, I startled a strange-looking\r\napparition in one of the open spaces beside the gulf, where, as shown by\r\nthe profusion of plants of _vaccinium_, the blaeberries had greatly\r\nabounded in their season. It was that of an extremely old woman,\r\ncadaverously pale and miserable looking, with dotage glistening in her\r\ninexpressive, rheum-distilling eyes, and attired in a blue cloak, that\r\nhad been homely when at its best, and was now exceedingly tattered. She\r\nhad been poking with her crutch among the bushes, as if looking for\r\nberries; but my approach had alarmed her; and she stood muttering in\r\nGaelic what seemed, from the tones and repetition, to be a few\r\ndeprecatory sentences. I addressed her in English, and inquired what\r\ncould have brought to a place so wild and lonely, one so feeble and\r\nhelpless. \"Poor object!\" she muttered in reply,--\"poor object!--very\r\nhungry;\" but her scanty English could carry her no further. I slipped\r\ninto her hand a small piece of silver, for which she overwhelmed me with\r\nthanks and blessings; and, bringing her to one of the broader avenues,\r\ntraversed by a road which leads out of the wood, I saw her fairly\r\nentered upon the path in the right direction, and then, retracing my\r\nsteps crossed the log-bridge. The old woman,--little, I should suppose\r\nfrom her appearance, under ninety,--was I doubt not, one of our\r\nill-provided Highland paupers, that starve under a law which, while it\r\nhas dried up the genial streams of voluntary charity in the country and\r\npresses hard upon the means of the humbler classes, alleviates little,\r\nif at all, the sufferings of the extreme poor. Amid present suffering\r\nand privation there had apparently mingled in her dotage some dream of\r\nearly enjoyment,--a dream of the days when she had plucked berries, a\r\nlittle herd-girl, on the banks of the Auldgrande; and the vision seemed\r\nto have sent her out, far advanced in her second childhood, to poke\r\namong the bushes with her crutch.\r\n\r\nMy old friend the minister of Alness,--uninstalled at the time in his\r\nnew dwelling,--was residing in a house scarce half a mile from the\r\nchasm, to which he had removed from the parish manse at the Disruption;\r\nand, availing myself of an invitation of long standing, I climbed the\r\nacclivity on which it stands, to pass the night with him. I found,\r\nhowever, that with part of his family, he had gone to spend a few weeks\r\nbeside the mineral springs of Strathpeffer, in the hope of recruiting a\r\nconstitution greatly weakened by excessive labor, and that the entire\r\nhousehold at home consisted of but two of the young ladies his\r\ndaughters, and their ward, the little Buchubai Hormazdji.\r\n\r\nAnd who, asks the reader, is this Buchubai Hormazdji? A little Parsi\r\ngirl, in her eighth year, the daughter of a Christian convert from the\r\nancient faith of Zoroaster, who now labors in the Free Church Mission at\r\nBombay. Buchubai, his only child, was on his conversion, forcibly taken\r\nfrom him by his relatives, but restored again by a British court of law;\r\nand he had secured her safety by sending her to Europe, a voyage of many\r\nthousand miles, with a lady, the wife of one of our Indian missionaries,\r\nto whom she had become attached, as her second but true mamma, and with\r\nwhose sisters I now found her. The little girl, sadly in want of a\r\ncompanion this evening, was content, for lack of a better, to accept of\r\nme as a playfellow; and she showed me all her rich eastern dresses, and\r\nall her toys, and a very fine emerald, set in the oriental fashion,\r\nwhich, when she was in full costume, sparkled from her embroidered\r\ntiara. I found her exceedingly like little girls at home, save that she\r\nseemed more than ordinarily observant and intelligent,--a consequence\r\nmayhap, of that early development, physical and mental, which\r\ncharacterizes her race. She submitted to me, too, when I had got very\r\nmuch into her confidence, a letter she had written to her papa from\r\nStrathpeffer, which was to be sent him by the next Indian mail. And as\r\nit may serve to show that the style of little girls whose fathers were\r\nfire-worshippers for three thousand years and more differs in no\r\nperceptible quality from the style of little girls whose fathers in\r\nconsiderably less than three thousand were Pagans, Papists, and\r\nProtestants by turns, besides passing through the various intermediate\r\nforms of belief, I must, after pledging the reader to strict secrecy,\r\nsubmit it to his perusal:--\r\n\r\n\"My dearest Papa,--I hope you are quite well. I am visiting mamma at\r\npresent at Strathpeffer. She is much better now than when she was\r\ntravelling. Mamma's sisters give their love to you, and mamma, and Mr.\r\nand Mrs. F. also. They all ask you to pray for them, and they will pray\r\nalso. There are a great many at water here for sick people to drink out\r\nof. The smell of the water is not at all nice. I sometimes drink it.\r\nGive my dearest love to Narsion Skishadre, and tell her that I will\r\nwrite to her.--Dearest papa,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple thought, which required no reach of mind whatever to\r\ngrasp,--and yet an hour spent with little Buchubai made it tell upon me\r\nmore powerfully than ever before,--that there is in reality but one\r\nhuman nature on the face of the earth. Had I simply read of Buchubai\r\nHormazdji corresponding with her father Hormazdji Pestonji, and sending\r\nher dear love to her old companion Narsion Skishadre, the names so\r\nspecifically different from those which we ourselves employ in\r\ndesignating our country folk, would probably have led me, through a\r\nfalse association, to regard the parties to which they attach as\r\nscarcely less specifically different from our country folk themselves. I\r\nsuspect we are misled by associations of this kind when we descant on\r\nthe peculiarities of race as interposing insurmountable barriers to the\r\nprogress of improvement, physical or mental. We overlook, amid the\r\ndiversities of form, color, and language, the specific identity of the\r\nhuman family. The Celt, for instance, wants, it is said, those powers of\r\nsustained application which so remarkably distinguish the Saxon; and so\r\nwe agree on the expediency of getting rid of our poor Highlanders by\r\nexpatriation as soon as possible, and of converting their country into\r\nsheep-walks and hunting-parks. It would be surely well to have\r\nphilosophy enough to remember what, simply through the exercise of a\r\nwise faith, the Christian missionary never forgets, that the\r\npeculiarities of race are not specific and ineradicable, but mere\r\ninduced habits and idiosyncracies engrafted on the stock of a common\r\nnature by accident of circumstance or development; and that, as they\r\nhave been wrought into the original tissue through the protracted\r\noperation of one set of causes, the operation of another and different\r\nset, wisely and perseveringly directed, could scarce fail to unravel and\r\nwork them out again. They form no part of the inherent design of man's\r\nnature, but have merely stuck to it in its transmissive passage\r\ndownwards and require to be brushed off. There was a time, some four\r\nthousand years ago, when Celt and Saxon were represented by but one man\r\nand his wife, with their children and their children's wives; and some\r\nsixteen or seventeen centuries earlier all the varieties of the\r\nspecies,--Caucasian and Negro, Mongolian and Malay,--lay close packed up\r\nin the world's single family. In short, Buchubai's amusing prattle\r\nproved to me this evening no bad commentary on St. Paul's sublime\r\nenunciation to the Athenians, that God has \"made of one blood all\r\nnations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth.\" I was amused to\r\nfind that the little girl, who listened intently as I described to the\r\nyoung ladies all I had seen and knew of the Auldgrande, had never before\r\nheard of a ghost, and could form no conception of one now. The ladies\r\nexplained, described, defined; carefully guarding all they said,\r\nhowever, by stern disclaimers against the ghost theory altogether, but\r\napparently to little purpose. At length Buchubai exclaimed, that she now\r\nknew what they meant, and that she herself had seen a great many ghosts\r\nin India. On explanation, however, her ghosts, though quite frightful\r\nenough, turned out to be not at all spiritual: they were things of\r\ncommon occurrence in the land she had come from,--exposed bodies of the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nNext morning--as the white clouds and thin mist-streaks of the preceding\r\nday had fairly foretold--was close and wet; and the long trail of vapor\r\nwhich rises from the chasm of the Auldgrande in such weather, and is\r\nknown to the people of the neighborhood as the \"smoke of the lady's\r\nbaking,\" hung, snake-like, over the river. About two o'clock the rain\r\nceased, hesitatingly and doubtfully, however, as if it did not quite\r\nknow its own mind; and there arose no breeze to shake the dank grass, or\r\nto dissipate the thin mist-wreath that continued to float over the river\r\nunder a sky of deep gray. But the ladies, with Buchubai, impatient to\r\njoin their friends at Strathpeffer, determined on journeying\r\nnotwithstanding; and, availing myself of their company and their\r\nvehicle, I travelled on with them to Dingwall, where we parted. I had\r\npurposed exploring the gray dingy sandstones and fetid breccias\r\ndeveloped along the shores on the northern side of the bay, about two\r\nmiles from the town, and on the sloping acclivities between the\r\nmansion-houses of Tulloch and Fowlis; but the day was still unfavorable,\r\nand the sections seemed untemptingly indifferent; besides, I could\r\nentertain no doubt that the dingy beds here are identical in place with\r\nthose of Cadboll on the coast of Easter Ross, which they closely\r\nresemble, and which alternate with the lower ichthyolitic beds of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone; and so, for the present at least, I gave up my\r\nintention of exploring them.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the sun, far gone down towards its place of setting,\r\nburst forth in great beauty; and, under the influence of a kindly breeze\r\nfrom the west, just strong enough to shake the wet leaves, the sky flung\r\noff its thick mantle of gray. I sauntered out along the high-road, in\r\nthe direction of my old haunts at Conon-side, with, however, no\r\nintention of walking so far. But the reaches of the river, a little in\r\nflood, shone temptingly through the dank foliage, and the cottages under\r\nthe Conon woods glittered clear on their sweeping hill-side, \"looking\r\ncheerily out\" into the landscape; and so I wandered on and on, over the\r\nbridge, and along the river, and through the pleasure grounds of\r\nConon-house, till I found myself in the old solitary burying-ground\r\nbeside the Conon, which, when last in this part of the country, I was\r\nprevented from visiting by the swollen waters. The rich yellow light\r\nstreamed through the interstices of the tall hedge of forest-trees that\r\nencircles the eminence, once an island, and fell in fantastic patches on\r\nthe gray tombstone and the graves. The ruinous little chapel in the\r\ncorner, whose walls a quarter of a century before I had distinctly\r\ntraced, had sunk into a green mound; and there remained over the sward\r\nbut the arch-stone of a Gothic window, with a portion of the moulded\r\ntransom attached, to indicate the character and style of the vanished\r\nbuilding. The old dial-stone, with the wasted gnomon, has also\r\ndisappeared; and the few bright-colored _throch-stanes_, raw from the\r\nchisel, that had been added of late years to the group of older\r\nstanding, did not quite make up for what time in the same period had\r\nwithdrawn. One of the newer inscriptions, however, recorded a curious\r\nfact. When I had resided in this part of the country so long before,\r\nthere was an aged couple in the neighborhood, who had lived together, it\r\nwas said, as man and wife, for more than sixty years: and now, here was\r\ntheir tombstone and epitaph. They had lived on long after my departure;\r\nand when, as the seasons passed, men and women whose births and baptisms\r\nhad taken place since their wedding-day were falling around them well\r\nstricken in years, death seemed to have forgotten _them_; and when he\r\ncame at last, their united ages made up well nigh two centuries. The\r\nwife had seen her ninety-sixth and the husband his hundred and second\r\nbirthday. It does not transcend the skill of the actuary to say how many\r\nthousand women must die under ninety-six for every one that reaches it,\r\nand how many tens of thousands of men must die under a hundred and two\r\nfor every man who attains to an age so extraordinary; but he would\r\nrequire to get beyond his tables in order to reckon up the chances\r\nagainst the woman destined to attain to ninety-six being courted and\r\nmarried in early life by the man born to attain to a hundred and two.\r\n\r\nAfter enjoying a magnificent sunset on the banks of the Conon, just\r\nwhere the scenery, exquisite throughout, is most delightful, I returned\r\nthrough the woods, and spent half an hour by the way in the cottage of a\r\nkindly-hearted woman, now considerably advanced in years, whom I had\r\nknown, when she was in middle life, as the wife of one of the Conon-side\r\nhinds, and who not unfrequently, when I was toiling at the mallet in the\r\nburning sun, hot and thirsty, and rather loosely knit for my work, had\r\nbrought me--all she had to offer at the time--a draught of fresh whey.\r\nAt first she seemed to have wholly forgotten both her kindness and the\r\nobject of it. She well remembered my master, and another Cromarty man\r\nwho had been grievously injured, when undermining an old building, by\r\nthe sudden fall of the erection; but she could bethink her of no third\r\nCromarty man whatever. \"Eh, sirs!\" she at length exclaimed, \"I daresay\r\nye'll be just the sma' prentice laddie. Weel, what will young folk no\r\ncome out o'? They were amaist a' stout big men at the wark except\r\nyoursel'; an' you're now stouter and bigger than maist o' them. Eh,\r\nsirs!--an' are ye still a mason?\" \"No; I have not wrought as a mason for\r\nthe last fourteen years; but I have to work hard enough for all that.\"\r\n\"Weel, weel, it's our appointed lot; an' if we have but health an'\r\nstrength, an' the wark to do, why should we repine?\" Once fairly entered\r\non our talk together, we gossipped on till the night fell, giving and\r\nreceiving information regarding our old acquaintances of a quarter of a\r\ncentury before; of whom we found that no inconsiderable proportion had\r\nalready sunk in the stream in which eventually we must all disappear.\r\nAnd then, taking leave of the kindly old woman, I walked on in the dark\r\nto Dingwall, where I spent the night. I could fain have called by the\r\nway on my old friend and brother-workman, Mr. Urquhart,--of a very\r\nnumerous party of mechanics employed at Conon-side in the year 1821 the\r\nonly individual now resident in this part of the country; but the\r\nlateness of the hour forbade. Next morning I returned by the Conon road,\r\nas far as the noble old bridge which strides across the stream at the\r\nvillage, and which has done so much to banish the water-wraith from the\r\nfords; and then striking off to the right, I crossed, by a path\r\ncomparatively little frequented, the insulated group of hills which\r\nseparates the valley of the Conon from that of the Peffer. The day was\r\nmild and pleasant, and the atmosphere clear; but the higher hills again\r\nexhibited their ominous belts of vapor, and there had been a slight\r\nfrost during the night,--at this autumnal season the almost certain\r\nprecursor of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     The Great Conglomerate--Its Undulatory and Rectilinear\r\n     Members--Knock Farril and its Vitrified Fort--The old Highlanders\r\n     an observant race--The Vein of Silver--Summit of Knock Farril--Mode\r\n     of accounting for the Luxuriance of Herbage in the ancient Scottish\r\n     Fortalices--The green Graves of Culloden--Theories respecting the\r\n     Vitrification of the Hill-forts--Combined Theories of Williams and\r\n     Mackenzie probably give the correct account--The Author's\r\n     Explanation--Transformations of Fused Rocks--Strathpeffer--The\r\n     Spa--Permanent Odoriferous Qualities of an ancient Sea-bottom\r\n     converted into Rock--Mineral Springs of the Spa--Infusion of the\r\n     powdered rock a substitute--Belemnite Water--The lively young\r\n     Lady's Comments--A befogged Country seen from a\r\n     hill-top--Ben-Wevis--Journey to Evanton--A Geologist's\r\n     Night-mare--The Route Home--Ruins of Craighouse--Incompatibility of\r\n     Tea and Ghosts--End of the Tour.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was once more on the Great Conglomerate,--here, as elsewhere, a\r\npicturesque, boldly-featured deposit, traversed by narrow, mural-sided\r\nvalleys, and tempested by bluff abrupt eminences. Its hills are greatly\r\nless confluent than those of most of the other sedimentary formations of\r\nScotland; and their insulated summits, recommended by their steep sides\r\nand limited areas to the old savage Vaubans of the Highlands, furnished,\r\nere the historic eras began, sites for not a few of the ancient\r\nhill-forts of the country. The vitrified fort of Craig Phadrig, of the\r\nOrd Hill of Kessock, and of Knock Farril,--two of the number, the first\r\nand last, being the most celebrated erections of their kind in the north\r\nof Scotland,--were all formed on hills of the Great Conglomerate. The\r\nConglomerate exists here as a sort of miniature Highlands, set down at\r\nthe northern side of a large angular bay of Palaeozoic rock, which\r\nindents the _true_ Highlands of the country, and which exhibits in its\r\ncentral area a prolongation of the long moory ridge of the Black Isle,\r\nformed, as I have already had occasion to remark, of an _upper_ deposit\r\nof the same lower division of the Old Red,--a deposit as noticeable for\r\naffecting a confluent, rectilinear character in its elevations, as the\r\nConglomerate is remarkable for exhibiting a detached and undulatory one.\r\nExactly the same features are presented by the same deposits in the\r\nneighborhood of Inverness; the _undulatory_ Conglomerate composing, to\r\nthe north and west of the town, the picturesque wavy ridge comprising\r\nthe twin-eminences of Munlochy Bay, the Ord Hill of Kessock, Craig\r\nPhadrig, and the fir-covered hill beyond in the line of the Great\r\nValley; while on the south and east the _rectilinear_ ichthyolitic\r\nmember of the system, with the arenaceous beds that lie over it, form\r\nthe continuous straight-lined ridge which runs on from beyond the moor\r\nof the Leys to beyond the moor of Culloden. There is a pretty little\r\nloch in this dwarf Highlands of the Brahan district, into which the old\r\nCeltic prophet Kenneth Ore, when, like Prospero, he relinquished his\r\nart, buried \"deep beyond plummet sound\" the magic stone in which he was\r\nwont to see the distant and the future. And with the loch it contains a\r\nnarrow, hermit-like dell, bearing but a single row of fields, and these\r\nof small size, along its flat bottom, and whose steep gray sides of\r\nrustic Conglomerate resemble Cyclopean walls. It, besides, includes\r\namong its hills the steep hill of Knock Farril, which, rising bluff and\r\nbold immediately over the southern slopes of Strathpeffer, adds so\r\ngreatly to the beauty of the valley, and bears atop perhaps the finest\r\nspecimen of the vitrified fort in Scotland; and the bold frontage of\r\ncliff presented by the group to the west, over the pleasure grounds of\r\nBrahan, is, though on no very large scale, one of the most\r\ncharacteristic of the Conglomerate formation which can be seen\r\nanywhere. It is formed of exactly such cliffs as the landscape gardener\r\nwould make if he could,--cliffs with their rude prominent pebbles\r\nbreaking the light over every square foot of surface, and furnishing\r\nfooting, by their innumerable projections, to many a green tuft of moss,\r\nand many a sweet little flower. Some of the masses, too, that have\r\nrolled down from the precipices among the Brahan woods far below, and\r\nstand up, like the ruins of cottages, amid the trees, are of singular\r\nbeauty,--worth all the imitation-ruins ever erected, and obnoxious to\r\nnone of the disparaging associations which the mere show and\r\nmake-believe of the artificial are sure always to awaken.\r\n\r\nWhatever exhibited an aspect in any degree extraordinary was sure to\r\nattract the notice of the old Highlanders,--an acutely observant race,\r\nhowever slightly developed their reflective powers; and the great\r\nnatural objects which excited their attention we always find associated\r\nwith some traditionary story. It is said that in the Conglomerate cliffs\r\nabove Brahan, a retainer of the Mackenzie, one of the smiths of the\r\ntribe, discovered a rich vein of silver, which he wrought by stealth,\r\nuntil he had filled one of the apartments of his cottage with bars and\r\ningots. But the treasure, it is added, was betrayed by his own\r\nunfortunate vanity, to his chief, who hanged him in order to serve\r\nhimself his heir; and no one since his death has proved ingenious enough\r\nto convert the rude rock into silver. Years had, I found, wrought their\r\nchanges amid the miniature Highlands of the Conglomerate. The sapplings\r\nof the straggling wood on the banks of Loch Ousy,--the pleasant little\r\nlake, or lochan rather, of this upland region,--that I remembered having\r\nseen scarce taller than myself, had shot into vigorous treehood; and the\r\nsteep slopes of Knock Farril, which I had left covered with their dark\r\nscreen of pine, were now thickly mottled over with half-decayed stumps,\r\nand bore that peculiarly barren aspect which tracts cleared of their\r\nwood so frequently assume in their transition state, when the plants\r\nthat flourished in the shade have died out in consequence of the\r\nexposure, and plants that love the open air and the unbroken sunshine\r\nhave not yet sprung up in their place. I found the southern acclivities\r\nof the hill covered with scattered masses of vitrified stone, that had\r\nfallen from the fortalice atop; and would recommend to the collector in\r\nquest of a characteristic specimen, that instead of laboring, to the\r\ngeneral detriment of the pile, in detaching one from the walls above, he\r\nshould set himself to seek one here. The blocks, uninjured by the\r\nhammer, exhibit, in most cases, the angular character of the original\r\nfragments better than those forcibly detached from the mass, and\r\npreserve in fine keeping those hollower interstices which were but\r\npartially filled with the molten matter, and which, when shattered by a\r\nblow, break through and lose their character.\r\n\r\nOne may spend an hour very agreeably on the green summit of Knock\r\nFarril. And at almost all seasons of the year a green summit it\r\nis,--greener considerably than any other hill-top in this part of the\r\ncountry. The more succulent grasses spring up rich and strong within the\r\nwalls, here and there roughened by tufts of nettles, tall and rank, and\r\nsomewhat perilous of approach,--witnesses, say the botanists, that man\r\nhad once a dwelling in the immediate neighborhood. The green luxuriance\r\nwhich characterizes so many of the more ancient fortalices of Scotland\r\nseems satisfactorily accounted for by Dr. Fleming, in his \"Zoology of\r\nthe Bass.\" \"The summits and sides of those hills which were occupied by\r\nour ancestors as _hill-forts_,\" says the naturalist, \"usually exhibit a\r\nfar richer herbage than corresponding heights in the neighborhood with\r\nthe mineral soil derived from the same source. It is to be kept in view,\r\nthat these positions of strength were at the same time occupied as\r\n_hill-folds_, into which, during the threatened or actual invasion of\r\nthe district by a hostile tribe, the cattle were driven, especially\r\nduring the night, as to places of safety, and sent out to pasture in the\r\nneighborhood during the day. And the droppings of these collected herds\r\nwould, as takes place in analogous cases at present, speedily improve\r\nthe soil to such an extent as to induce a permanent fertility.\" The\r\nfurther instance adduced by the Doctor, in showing through what\r\nprotracted periods causes transitory in themselves may remain palpably\r\ninfluential in their effects, is curiously suggestive of the old\r\nmetaphysical idea, that as every effect has its cause, \"recurring from\r\ncause to cause up to the abyss of eternity, so every cause has also its\r\neffects, linked forward in succession to the end of time.\" On the bleak\r\nmoor of Culloden the graves of the slain still exist as patches of green\r\nsward, surrounded by a brown groundwork of stunted heather. The animal\r\nmatter,--once the nerves, muscles, and sinews of brave men,--which\r\noriginated the change, must have been wholly dissipated ages ago. But\r\nthe effect once produced has so decidedly maintained itself, that it\r\nremains not less distinctly stamped upon the heath in the present day\r\nthan it could have been in the middle of the last century, only a few\r\nyears after the battle had been stricken.\r\n\r\nThe vitrification of the rampart which on every side incloses the grassy\r\narea has been more variously, but less satisfactorily, accounted for\r\nthan the green luxuriance within. It was held by Pennant to be an effect\r\nof volcanic fire, and that the walls of this and all our other vitrified\r\nstrongholds are simply the crater-rims of extinct volcanoes,--a\r\nhypothesis wholly as untenable in reference to the hill-forts as to the\r\nlime-kilns of the country: the vitrified forts are as little volcanic as\r\nthe vitrified kilns. Williams, the author of the \"Mineral Kingdom,\" and\r\none of our earlier British geologists, after deciding, on data which his\r\npeculiar pursuits enabled him to collect and weigh, that they are _not_\r\nvolcanic, broached the theory, still prevalent, as their name testifies,\r\nthat they are artificial structures, in which vitrescency was designedly\r\ninduced, in order to cement into solid masses accumulations of loose\r\nmaterials. Lord Woodhouselee advocated an opposite view. Resting on the\r\nfact that the vitrification is but of partial occurrence, be held that\r\nit had been produced, not of design by the builders of the forts, but in\r\nthe process of their demolition by a besieging enemy, who, finding, as\r\nhe premised, a large portion of the ramparts composed of wood, had\r\nsucceeded in setting them on fire. This hypothesis, however, seems quite\r\nas untenable as that of Pennant. Fires not unfrequently occur in cities,\r\namong crowded groups of houses, where walls of stone are surrounded by a\r\nmuch greater profusion of dry woodwork than could possibly have entered\r\ninto the composition of the ramparts of a hill-fort; but who ever saw,\r\nafter a city fire, masses of wall from eight to ten feet in thickness\r\nfused throughout? The sandstone columns of the aisles of the Old\r\nGreyfriars in Edinburgh, surrounded by the woodwork of the galleries,\r\nthe flooring, the seating, and the roof, were wasted, during the fire\r\nwhich destroyed the pile, into mere skeletons of their former selves;\r\nbut though originally not more than three feet in diameter, they\r\nexhibited no marks of vitrescency. And it does not seem in the least\r\nprobable that the stonework of the Knock Farril rampart could, if\r\nsurrounded by wood at all, have been surrounded by an amount equally\r\ngreat, in proportion to its mass, as that which enveloped the\r\naisle-columns of the Old Greyfriars.\r\n\r\nThe late Sir George Mackenzie of Coul adopted yet a fourth view. He\r\nheld that the vitrification is simply an effect of the ancient\r\nbeacon-fires kindled to warn the country of an invading enemy. But how\r\naccount, on this hypothesis, for ramparts continuous, as in the case of\r\nKnock Farril, all round the hill? A powerful fire long kept up might\r\nwell fuse a heap of loose stones into a solid mass; the bonfire lighted\r\non the summit of Arthur Seat in 1842, to welcome the Queen on her first\r\nvisit to Scotland, particularly fused numerous detached fragments of\r\nbasalt, and imparted, in some spots to the depth of about half an inch,\r\na vesicular structure to the solid rock beneath. But no fire, however\r\npowerful, could have constructed a rampart running without break for\r\nseveral hundred feet round an insulated hill-top. \"To be satisfied,\"\r\nsaid Sir George, \"of the reason why the signal-fires should be kindled\r\non or beside a heap of stones, we have only to imagine a gale of wind to\r\nhave arisen when a fire was kindled on the bare ground. The fuel would\r\nbe blown about and dispersed, to the great annoyance of those who\r\nattended. The plan for obviating the inconvenience thus occasioned which\r\nwould occur most naturally and readily would be to raise a heap of\r\nstones, on either side of which the fire might be placed to windward;\r\nand to account for the vitrification appearing all round the area, it is\r\nonly necessary to allow the inhabitants of the country to have had a\r\nsystem of signals. A fire at one end might denote something different\r\nfrom a fire at the other, or in some intermediate part. On some\r\noccasions two or more fires might be necessary, and sometimes a fire\r\nalong the whole line. It cannot be doubted,\" he adds, \"that the rampart\r\nwas originally formed with as much regularity as the nature of the\r\nmaterials would allow, both in order to render it more durable, and to\r\nmake it serve the purposes of defence.\" This, I am afraid, is still\r\nvery unsatisfactory. A fire lighted along the entire line of a wall\r\ninclosing nearly an acre of area could not be other than a very\r\nattenuated, wire-drawn line of fire indeed, and could never possess\r\nstrength enough to melt the ponderous mass of rampart beneath, as if it\r\nhad been formed of wax or resin. A thousand loads of wood piled in a\r\nring round the summit of Knock Farril, and set at once into a blaze,\r\nwould wholly fail to affect the broad rampart below; and long ere even a\r\nthousand, or half a thousand, loads could have been cut down, collected,\r\nand fired, an invading enemy would have found time enough to moor his\r\nfleet and land his forces, and possess himself of the lower country.\r\nAgain, the unbroken continuity of the vitrified line militates against\r\nthe signal-system theory. Fire trod so closely upon the heels of fire,\r\nthat the vitrescency induced by the one fire impinged on and mingled\r\nwith the vitrescency induced by the others beside it. There is no other\r\nmode of accounting for the continuity of the fusion; and how could\r\ndefinite meanings possibly be attached to the various parts of a line so\r\nminutely graduated, that the centre of the fire kindled on any one\r\ngraduation could be scarce ten feet apart from the centre of the fire\r\nkindled on any of its two neighboring graduations? Even by day, the\r\nexact compartment which a fire occupied could not be distinguished, at\r\nthe distance of half a mile, from its neighboring compartments, and not\r\nat all by night, at any distance, from even the compartments farthest\r\nremoved from it. Who, for instance, at the distance of a dozen miles or\r\nso, could tell whether the flame that shone out in the darkness, when\r\nall other objects around it were invisible, was kindled on the east or\r\nwest end of an eminence little more than a hundred yards in length? Nay,\r\nwho could determine,--for such is the requirement of the\r\nhypothesis,--whether it rose from a compartment of the summit a hundred\r\nfeet distant from its west or east end, or from a compartment merely\r\nninety or a hundred and ten feet distant from it? The supposed signal\r\nsystem, added to the mere beacon hypothesis, is palpably untenable.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Williams, however, which is, I am inclined to think, the\r\ntrue one in the main, seems capable of being considerably modified and\r\nimproved by the hypothesis of Sir George. The hill-fort,--palpably the\r\nmost primitive form of fortalice or stronghold originated in a\r\nmountainous country,--seems to constitute man's first essay towards\r\nneutralizing, by the art of fortification, the advantages of superior\r\nforce on the side of an assailing enemy. It was found, on the discovery\r\nof New Zealand, that the savage inhabitants had already learned to erect\r\nexactly such hill-forts amid the fastnesses of that country as those\r\nwhich were erected two thousand years earlier by the Scottish aborigines\r\namid the fastnesses of our own. Nothing seems more probable, therefore,\r\nthan that the forts of eminences such as Craig Phadrig and Knock Farril,\r\noriginally mere inclosures of loose, uncemented stones, may belong to a\r\nperiod not less ancient than that of the first barbarous wars of\r\nScotland, when, though tribe battled with tribe in fierce warfare, like\r\nthe red men of the West with their brethren ere the European had landed\r\non their shores, navigation was yet in so immature a state in Northern\r\nEurope as to secure to them an exemption from foreign invasion. In an\r\nafter age, however, when the roving Vikings had become formidable, many\r\nof the eminences originally selected, from _their inaccessibility_, as\r\nsites for hill-forts, would come to be chosen, from _their prominence in\r\nthe landscape_, as stations for beacon-fires. And of course the\r\npreviously erected ramparts, higher always than the inclosed areas,\r\nwould furnish on such hills the conspicuous points from which the fires\r\ncould be best seen. Let us suppose, then, that the rampart-crested\r\neminence of Knock Farril, seen on every side for many miles, has become\r\nin the age of northern invasion one of the beacon-posts of the district,\r\nand that large fires, abundantly supplied with fuel by the woods of a\r\nforest-covered country, and blown at times into intense heat by the\r\nstrong winds so frequent in that upper stratum of air into which the\r\nsummit penetrates, have been kindled some six or eight times on some\r\nprominent point of the rampart, raised, mayhap, many centuries before.\r\nAt first the heat has failed to tell on the stubborn quartz and feldspar\r\nwhich forms the preponderating material of the gneisses, granites,\r\nquartz rocks, and coarse conglomerate sandstones on which it has been\r\nbrought to operate; but each fire throws down into the interstices a\r\nconsiderable amount of the fixed salt of the wood, till at length the\r\nheap has become charged with a strong flux; and then one powerful fire\r\nmore, fanned to a white heat by a keen, dry breeze, reduces the whole\r\ninto a semi-fluid mass. The same effects have been produced on the\r\nmaterials of the rampart by the beacon-fires and the alkali, that were\r\nproduced, according to Pliny, by the fires and the soda of the\r\nPhoenician merchants storm-bound on the sands of the river Belus. But\r\nthe state of civilization in Scotland at the time is not such as to\r\npermit of the discovery being followed up by similar results. The\r\nsemi-savage guardians of the beacon wonder at the _accident_, as they\r\nwell may; but those happy accidents in which the higher order of\r\ndiscoveries originate occur in only the ages of cultivated minds; and so\r\nthey do not acquire from it the art of manufacturing glass. It could not\r\nfail being perceived, however, by intellects at all human, that the\r\nconsolidation which the fires of one week, or month, or year, as the\r\ncase happened, had effected on one portion of the wall, might be\r\nproduced by the fires of another week, or month, or year, on another\r\nportion of it; that, in short, a loose incoherent rampart, easy of\r\ndemolition, might be converted, through the newly-discovered process,\r\ninto a rampart as solid and indestructible as the rock on which it\r\nrested. And so, in course of time, simply by shifting the beacon-fires,\r\nand bringing them to bear in succession on every part of the wall, Knock\r\nFarril, with many a similar eminence in the country, comes to exhibit\r\nits completely vitrified fort where there had been but a loosely-piled\r\nhill-fort before. It in no degree militates against this compound\r\ntheory,--borrowed in part from Williams and in part from Sir\r\nGeorge,--that there are detached vitrified masses to be found on\r\neminences evidently never occupied by hill-forts; or that there are\r\nhill-forts on other eminences only partially fused, or hill-forts on\r\nmany of the less commanding sites that bear about them no marks of fire\r\nat all. Nothing can be more probable than that in the first class of\r\ncases we have eminences that had been selected as beacon-stations, which\r\nhad not previously been occupied by hill-forts; and in the last,\r\neminences that had been occupied by hill-forts which, from their want of\r\nprominence in the general landscape, had not been selected as\r\nbeacon-stations. And in the intermediate class of cases we have probably\r\nramparts that were only partially vitrified, because some want of fuel\r\nin the neighborhood had starved the customary fires, or because fires\r\nhad to be less frequently kindled upon them than on the more important\r\nstations; or, finally, because these hill-forts, from some disadvantage\r\nof situation, were no longer used as places of strength, and so the\r\nbeacon-keepers had no motive to attempt consolidating them throughout by\r\nthe piecemeal application of the vitrifying agent. But the old Highland\r\nmode of accounting for the present appearance of Knock Farril and its\r\nvitrified remains is perhaps, after all, quite as good in its way as any\r\nof the modes suggested by the philosophers.[20]\r\n\r\nI spent some time, agreeably enough, beside the rude rampart of Knock\r\nFarril, in marking the various appearances exhibited by the fused and\r\nsemi-fused materials of which it is composed,--the granites, gneisses,\r\nmica-schists, hornblendes, clay-slates, and red sandstones of the\r\nlocality. One piece of rock, containing much lime, I found resolved into\r\na yellow opaque substance, not unlike the coarse earthenware used in the\r\nmaking of ginger-beer bottles; but though it had been so completely\r\nmolten that it had dropped into a hollow beneath in long viscid trails,\r\nit did not contain a single air-vesicle; while another specimen,\r\napparently a piece of fused mica-schist, was so filled with air-cells,\r\nthat the dividing partitions were scarcely the tenth of a line in\r\nthickness. I found bits of schistose gneiss resolved into green glass;\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone basis of the Conglomerate, which forms the hill,\r\ninto a semi-metallic scoria, like that of an iron-smelter's furnace;\r\nmica into a gray, waxy-looking stone, that scratched glass; and pure\r\nwhite quartz into porcellanic trails of white, that ran in one instance\r\nalong the face of a darker-colored rock below, like streaks of cream\r\nalong the sides of a burnt china jug. In one mass of pale large-grained\r\ngranite I found that the feldspar, though it had acquired a vitreous\r\ngloss on the surface, still retained its peculiar rhomboidal cleavage;\r\nwhile the less stubborn quartz around it had become scarce less\r\nvesicular and light than a piece of pumice. On some of the other masses\r\nthere was impressed, as if by a seal, the stamp of pieces of charcoal;\r\nand so sharply was the impression retained, that I could detect on the\r\nvitreous surface the mark of the yearly growths, and even of the\r\nmedullary rays, of the wood. In breaking open some of the others, I\r\ndetected fragments of the charcoal itself, which, hermetically locked up\r\nin the rock, had retained all its original carbon. These last reminded\r\nme of specimens not unfrequent among the trap-rocks of the Carboniferous\r\nand Oolitic systems. From an intrusive overlying wacke in the\r\nneighborhood of Linlithgow I have derived for my collection pieces of\r\ncarbonized wood in so complete a state of keeping, that under the\r\nmicroscope they exhibit unbroken all the characteristic reticulations of\r\nthe coniferae of the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nI descended the hill, and, after joining my friends at\r\nStrathpeffer,--Buchubai Hormazdji among the rest,--visited the Spa, in\r\nthe company of my old friend the minister of Alness. The thorough\r\nidentity of the powerful effluvium that fills the pump-room with that of\r\na muddy sea-bottom laid bare in warm weather by the tide, is to the\r\ndweller on the sea-coast very striking. It _is_ identity,--not mere\r\nresemblance. In most cases the organic substances undergo great changes\r\nin the bowels of the earth. The animal matter of the Caithness\r\nichthyolites exists, for instance, as a hard, black, insoluble bitumen,\r\nwhich I have used oftener than once as sealing-wax; the vegetable mould\r\nof the Coal Measures has been converted into a fire-clay, so altered in\r\nthe organic pabulum, animal and vegetable, whence it derived its\r\nfertility, that, even when laid open for years to the meliorating\r\neffects of the weather and the visits of the winged seeds, it will not\r\nbe found bearing a single spike or leaf of green. But here, in smell, at\r\nleast, that ancient mud, swum over by the Diplopterus and the\r\nDiplacanthus, and in which the Coccosteus and Pterichthys burrowed, has\r\nundergone no change. The soft ooze has become solid rock, but its\r\nodoriferous qualities have remained unaltered. I next visited an\r\nexcavation a few hundred yards on the upper side of the pump-room, in\r\nwhich the gray fetid breccia of the Strath has been quarried for\r\ndyke-building, and examined the rock with some degree of care, without,\r\nhowever, detecting in it a single plate or scale. Lying over that\r\nConglomerate member of the system which, rising high in the Knock Farril\r\nrange, forms the southern boundary of the valley, it occupies the place\r\nof the lower ichthyolitic bed, so rich in organisms in various other\r\nparts of the country; but here the bed, after it had been deposited in\r\nthin horizontal laminae, and had hardened into stone, seems to have been\r\nbroken up, by some violent movement, into minute sharp-edged fragments,\r\nthat, without wear or attrition, were again consolidated into the\r\nbreccia which it now forms. And its ichthyolites, if not previously\r\nabsorbed, were probably destroyed in the convulsion. Detached scales and\r\nspines, however, if carefully sought for in the various openings of the\r\nvalley, might still be found in the original laminae of the fragments.\r\nThey must have been amazingly abundant in it once; for so largely\r\nsaturated is the rock with the organic matter into which they have been\r\nresolved, that, when struck by the hammer, the impalpable dust set loose\r\nsensibly affects the organs of taste, and appeals very strongly to those\r\nof smell. It is through this saturated rock that the mineral springs\r\ntake their course. Even the surface-waters of the valley, as they pass\r\nover it contract in a perceptible degree its peculiar taste and odor.\r\nWith a little more time to spare, I would fain have made this breccia of\r\nthe Old Red the subject of a few simple experiments. I would have ground\r\nit into powder, and tried upon it the effect both of cold and hot\r\ninfusion. Portions of the water are sometimes carried in casks and\r\nbottles, for the use of invalids, to a considerable distance; but it is\r\nquite possible that a little of the _rock_, to which the water owes its\r\nqualities, might, when treated in this way, have all the effects of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the _spring_. It might be of some interest,\r\ntoo, to ascertain its qualities when crushed, as a soil, or its effect\r\non other soils; whether, for instance, like the old sterile soils of the\r\nCarboniferous period, it has lost, through its rock-change, the\r\nfertilizing properties which it once possessed; or whether it still\r\nretains them, like some of the coprolitic beds of the Oolite and\r\nGreensand, and might not, in consequence, be employed as a manure. A\r\ncourse of such experiments could scarce fail to furnish with agreeable\r\noccupation some of the numerous annual visitants of the Spa, who have to\r\nlinger long, with but little to engage them, waiting for what, if it\r\nonce fairly leave a man, returns slowly, when it returns at all.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning at the dinner-table of my friend my scheme of infusing\r\nrock in order to produce Spa water, I referred to the circumstance that\r\nthe Belemnite of our Liasic deposits, when ground into powder, imparts\r\nto boiling water a peculiar taste and smell, and that the infusion,\r\ntaken in very small quantities, sensibly affects both palate and\r\nstomach. And I suggested that Belemnite water, deemed sovereign of old,\r\nwhen the Belemnite was regarded as a thunderbolt, in the cure of\r\nbewitched cattle, might be in reality medicinal, and that the ancient\r\nsuperstition might thus embody, as ancient superstitions not\r\nunfrequently do, a nucleus of fact. The charm, I said, might amount to\r\nno more than simply the administration of a medicine to sick cattle,\r\nthat did harm in no case, and good at times. The lively comment of one\r\nof the young ladies on the remark amused us all. If an infusion of stone\r\nhad cured, in the last age, cattle that were bewitched, the Strathpeffer\r\nwater, she argued, which was, it seems, but an infusion of stone, might\r\ncure cattle that were sick now; and so, though the biped patients of\r\nthe Strath could scarce fail to decrease when they knew that its infused\r\nstone contained but the strainings of old mud, and the juices of dead\r\nunsalted fish, it was gratifying to think that the poor Spa might still\r\ncontinue to retain its patients, though of a lower order. The pump-room\r\nwould be converted into a rustic, straw-thatched shed, to which long\r\ntrains of sick cattle, affected by weak nerves and dyspepsia, would come\r\nstreaming along the roads every morning and evening, to drink and gather\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe following morning was wet and lowering, and a flat ceiling of gray\r\ncloud stretched across the valley, from the summit of the Knock Farril\r\nridge of hills on the one side, to the lower flanks of Ben-Wevis on the\r\nother. I had purposed ascending this latter mountain,--the giant of the\r\nnorth-eastern coast, and one of the loftiest of our second-class\r\nScottish hills anywhere,--to ascertain the extreme upper line at which\r\ntravelled boulders occur in this part of the country. But it was no\r\nmorning for wading knee-deep through the trackless heather; and after\r\nwaiting on, in the hope the weather might clear up, watching at a window\r\nthe poorer invalids at the Spa, as they dragged themselves through the\r\nrain to the water, I lost patience, and sallied out, beplaided and\r\numbrellaed, to see from the top of Knock Farril how the country looked\r\nin a fog. At first, however, I saw much fog, but little country; but as\r\nthe day wore on, the flat mist-ceiling rose together, till it rested on\r\nbut the distant hills, and the more prominent features of the landscape\r\nbegan to stand out amid the more general gray, like the stronger lines\r\nand masses in a half-finished drawing, boldly dashed off in the neutral\r\ntint of the artist. The portions of the prospect generically distinct\r\nare, notwithstanding its great extent and variety, but few; and the\r\npartial veil of haze, by glazing down its distracting multiplicity of\r\nminor points, served to bring them out all the more distinctly. There\r\nis, first stretching far in a southern and eastern direction along the\r\nlandscape, the rectilinear ridge of the Black Isle,--not quite the sort\r\nof line a painter would introduce into a composition, but true to\r\ngeologic character. More in the foreground, in the same direction, there\r\nspreads a troubled cockling sea of the Great Conglomerate. Turning to\r\nthe north and west, the deep valley of Strathpeffer, with its expanse of\r\nrich level fields, and in the midst its old baronial castle, surrounded\r\nby coeval trees of vast bulk, lies so immediately at the foot of the\r\neminence, that I could hear in the calm the rush of the little stream,\r\nswollen to thrice its usual bulk by the rains of the night. Beyond rose\r\nthe thick-set Ben-Wevis,--a true gneiss mountain, with breadth enough of\r\nshoulders, and amplitude enough of base, to serve a mountain thrice as\r\ntall, but which, like all its cogeners of this ancient formation, was\r\narrested in its second stage of growth, so that many of the slimmer\r\ngranitic and porphyritic hills of the country look down upon it, as\r\nAgamemnon, according to Homer, looked down upon Ulysses.\r\n\r\n \"Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,\r\n Though great Atrides overtops his head.\"\r\n\r\nAll around, as if topling, wave-like, over the outer edges of the\r\ncomparatively flat area of Palaeozoic rock which composes the middle\r\nground of the landscape, rose a multitude of primary hill-peaks, barely\r\ndiscernible in the haze; while the long withdrawing Dingwall Frith,\r\nstretching on towards the open sea for full twenty miles, and flanked on\r\neither side by ridges of sandstone, but guarded at the opening by two\r\nsquat granitic columns, completed the prospect, by adding to its last\r\ngreat feature. All was gloomy and chill; and as I turned me down the\r\ndescent, the thick wetting drizzle again came on; and the mist-wreaths,\r\nafter creeping upwards along the hill-side, began again to creep down.\r\nWhen I had first visited the valley, more than a quarter of a century\r\nbefore, it was on a hot breathless day of early summer, in which, though\r\nthe trees in fresh leaf seemed drooping in the sunshine, and the\r\nsucculent luxuriance of the fields lay aslant, half-prostrated by the\r\nfierce heat, the rich blue of Ben-Wevis, far above, was thickly streaked\r\nwith snow, on which it was luxury even to look. It gave one iced\r\nfancies, wherewithal to slake, amid the bright glow of summer, the\r\nthirst in the mind. The recollection came strongly upon me, as the fog\r\nfrom the hill-top closed dark behind, like that sung by the old blind\r\nEnglishman, which\r\n\r\n        \"O'er the marish glides,\r\nAnd gathers ground fast at the lab'rer's heel,\r\nHomeward returning.\"\r\n\r\nBut the contrast had nothing sad in it; and it was pleasant to feel that\r\nit had not. I had resigned many a baseless hope and many an idle desire\r\nsince I had spent a vacant day amid the sunshine, now gazing on the\r\nbroad placid features of the snow-streaked mountain; and now sauntering\r\nunder the tall ancient woods, or along the heath-covered slopes of the\r\nvalley; but in relation to never-tiring, inexhaustible nature, the heart\r\nwas no fresher at that time than it was now. I had grown no older in my\r\nfeelings or in my capacity of enjoyment; and what then was there to\r\nregret?\r\n\r\nI rode down the Strath in an omnibus which plies between the Spa and\r\nDingwall, and then walked on to the village of Evanton, which I reached\r\nabout an hour after nightfall, somewhat in the circumstances of the\r\n\"damp stranger,\" who gave Beau Brummel the cold. There were, however, no\r\nBeau Brummels in the quiet village inn in which I passed the night, and\r\nso the effects of the damp were wholly confined to myself. I was soundly\r\npummelled during the night by a frightful female, who first assumed the\r\nappearance of the miserable pauper woman whom I had seen beside the\r\nAuldgrande, and then became the Lady of Balconie; and, though\r\nsufficiently indignant, and much inclined to resist, I could stir\r\nneither hand nor foot, but lay passively on my back, jambed fast behind\r\nthe huge gneiss boulder and the edge of the gulf. And yet, by a strange\r\nduality of perception, I was conscious all the while that, having got\r\nwet on the previous day, I was now suffering from an attack of\r\nnightmare: and held that it would be no very serious matter even should\r\nthe lady tumble me into the gulf, seeing that all would be well again\r\nwhen I awoke in the morning. Dreams of this character, in which\r\nconsciousness bears reference at once to the fictitious events of the\r\nvision and the real circumstances of the sleeper, must occupy, I am\r\ninclined to think, very little time,--single moments, mayhap, poised\r\nmidway between the sleeping and waking state. Next day (Sunday) I\r\nattended the Free Church in the parish, where I found a numerous and\r\nattentive congregation,--descendants, in large part, of the old devout\r\nMunroes of Ferindonald,--and heard a good solid discourse. And on the\r\nfollowing morning I crossed the sea at what is known as the Fowlis\r\nFerry, to explore, on my homeward route, the rocks laid bare along the\r\nshore in the upper reaches of the Frith.\r\n\r\nI found but little by the way: black patches of bitumen in the sandstone\r\nof one of the beds, with a bed of stratified clay, inclosing nodules, in\r\nwhich, however, I succeeded in detecting nothing organic; and a few\r\nfragments of clay-slate locked up in the Red Sandstone, sharp and\r\nunworn at their edges, as if derived from no great distance, though\r\nthere be now no clay-slate in the eastern half of Ross; but though the\r\nrocks here belong evidently to the ichthyolitic member of the Old Red,\r\nnot a single fish, not a \"nibble\" even, repaid the patient search of\r\nhalf a day. I, however, passed some time agreeably enough among the\r\nruins of Craighouse. When I had last seen, many years before, this old\r\ncastle,[21] the upper stories were accessible; but they were now no\r\nlonger so. Time, and the little herdboys who occasionally shelter in its\r\nvaults, had been busy in the interval; and, by breaking off a few\r\nprojecting corners by which the climber had held, and by effacing a few\r\nnotches into which he had thrust his toe-points, they had rendered what\r\nhad been merely difficult impracticable. I remarked that the huge\r\nkitchen chimney of the building,--a deep hollow recess which stretches\r\nacross the entire gable, and in which, it is said, two thrashers once\r\nplied the flail for a whole winter,--bore less of the stain of recent\r\nsmoke than it used to exhibit twenty years before; and inferred that\r\nthere would be fewer wraith-lights seen from the castle at nights than\r\nin those days of _evil spirits_ and illicit stills, when the cottars in\r\nthe neighborhood sent more smuggled whiskey to market than any equal\r\nnumber of the inhabitants of almost any other district in the north. It\r\nhas been long alleged that there existed a close connection between the\r\nmore ghostly spirits of the country and its distilled ones. \"How do you\r\naccount,\" said a north country minister of the last age (the late Rev.\r\nMr. M'Bean of Alves) to a sagacious old elder of his Session, \"for the\r\nalmost total disappearance of the ghosts and fairies that used to be so\r\ncommon in your young days?\" \"Tak my word for 't, minister,\" replied the\r\nshrewd old man, \"it's a' owing to the _tea_; when the _tea_ cam in, the\r\nghaists an' fairies gaed out. Weel do I mind when at a' our neeborly\r\nmeetings,--bridals, christenings, lyke-wakes, an' the like,--we\r\nentertained ane anither wi' rich nappy ale; an' whan the verra dowiest\r\no' us used to get warm i' the face, an' a little confused in the head,\r\nan' weel fit to see amaist onything whan on the muirs on our way hame.\r\nBut the tea has put out the nappy; an' I have remarked, that by losing\r\nthe nappy we lost baith ghaists an' fairies.\"\r\n\r\nQuitting the ruin, I walked on along the shore, tracing the sandstone as\r\nI went, as it rises from lower to higher beds; and where it ceases to\r\ncrop out at the surface, and gravel and the red boulder-clays take the\r\nplace of rock, I struck up the hill, and, traversing the parishes of\r\nResolis and Cromarty, got home early in the evening. I had seen and done\r\nscarcely half what I had intended seeing or doing: alas, that in\r\nreference to every walk which I have yet attempted to tread, this\r\nspecial statement should be so invariably true to fact!--alas, that all\r\nmy full purposes, should be coupled with but half realizations! But I\r\nhad at least the satisfaction, that though I had accomplished little, I\r\nhad enjoyed much; and it is something, though not all, nor nearly all,\r\nthat, since time is passing, it should pass happily. In my next chapter\r\nI shall enter on my tour to Orkney. It dates one year earlier (1846)\r\nthan the tour with which I have already occupied so many chapters; but I\r\nhave thus inverted the order of _time_, by placing it last, that I may\r\nbe able so to preserve the order of _space_ as to render the tract\r\ntravelled over in my narrative continuous from Edinburgh to the northern\r\nextremity of Pomona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     Recovered Health--Journey to the Orkneys--Aboard the Steamer at\r\n     Wick--Mr. Bremner--Masonry of the Harbor of Wick--The greatest\r\n     Blunders result from good Rules misapplied--Mr. Bremner's Theory\r\n     about sea-washed Masonry--Singular Fracture of the Rock near\r\n     Wick--The Author's mode of accounting for it--\"Simple but not\r\n     obvious\" Thinking--Mr. Bremner's mode of making stone Erections\r\n     under Water--His exploits in raising foundered Vessels--Aspect of\r\n     the Orkneys--- The ungracious Schoolmaster--In the Frith of\r\n     Kirkwall--Cathedral of St. Magnus--Appearance of Kirkwall--Its\r\n     \"perished suppers\"--Its ancient Palaces--Blunder of the Scotch\r\n     Aristocracy--The patronate Wedge--Breaking Ground in Orkney--Minute\r\n     gregarious Coccosteus--True Position of the Coccosteus' Eyes--Ruins\r\n     of one of Cromwell's Forts--Antiquities of Orkney--The\r\n     Cathedral--Its Sculptures--The Mysterious Cell--Prospect from the\r\n     Tower--Its Chimes--Ruins of Castle Patrick.\r\n\r\n\r\nA twelvemonth had gone by since a lingering indisposition, which bore\r\nheavily on the springs of life, compelled me to postpone a\r\nlong-projected journey to the Orkneys, and led me to visit, instead,\r\nrich level England, with its well-kept roads and smooth railways, along\r\nwhich the enfeebled invalid can travel far without fatigue. I had now\r\ngot greatly stronger; and, if not quite up to my old thirty miles per\r\nday, nor altogether so bold a cragsman as I had been only a few years\r\nbefore, I was at least vigorous enough to enjoy a middling long walk,\r\nand to breast a tolerably steep hill. And so I resolved on at least\r\nglancing over, if not exploring, the fossiliferous deposits of the\r\nOrkneys, trusting that an eye somewhat practised in the formations\r\nmainly developed in these islands might enable me to make some amends\r\nfor seeing comparatively little, by seeing well. I took coach at\r\nInvergordon for Wick early in the morning of Friday; and, after a weary\r\nride, in a bleak gusty day, that sent the dust of the road whirling\r\nabout the ears of the sorely-tossed \"outsides,\" with whom I had taken my\r\nchance, I alighted in Wick, at the inn-door, a little after six o'clock\r\nin the evening. The following morning was wet and dreary; and a tumbling\r\nsea, raised by the wind of the previous day and night, came rolling into\r\nthe bay; but the waves bore with them no steamer; and when, some five\r\nhours after the expected time, she also came rolling in, her darkened\r\nand weather-beaten sides and rigging gave evidence that her passage from\r\nthe south had been no holiday trip. Impatient, however, of looking out\r\nupon the sea for hours, from under dripping eaves, and through the\r\ndimmed panes of streaming windows, I got aboard with about half-a-dozen\r\nother passengers; and while the Wick goods were in the course of being\r\ntransferred to two large boats alongside, we lay tossing in the open\r\nbay. The work of raising box and package was superintended by a tall\r\nelderly gentleman from the shore, peculiarly Scotch in his\r\nappearance,--the steam company's agent for this part of the country.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said an acquaintance, pointing to the agent, \"is a very\r\nextraordinary man,--in his own special walk, one of the most\r\noriginal-minded, and at the same time most thoroughly practical, you\r\nperhaps ever saw. That is Mr. Bremner of Wick, known now all over\r\nBritain for his success in raising foundered vessels, when every one\r\nelse gives them up. In the lifting of vast weights, or the overcoming\r\nthe _vis inertiae_ of the hugest bodies, nothing ever baffles Mr.\r\nBremner. But come, I must introduce you to him. He takes an interest in\r\nyour peculiar science, and is familiar with your geological writings.\"\r\n\r\nI was accordingly introduced to Mr. Bremner, and passed, in his company\r\nthe half-hour which we spent in the bay, in a way that made me wish the\r\ntime doubled. I had been struck by the peculiar style of masonry\r\nemployed in the harbor of Wick, and by its rock-like strength. The gray\r\nponderous stones of the flagstone series of which it is built, instead\r\nof being placed on their flatter beds, like common ashlar in a building,\r\nor horizontal strata in a quarry, are raised on end, like staves in a\r\npail or barrel, so that at some little distance the work looks as if\r\nformed of upright piles or beams jambed fast together. I had learned\r\nthat Mr. Bremner had been the builder, and adverted to the peculiarity\r\nof his style of building. \"You have given a vertical tilt to your\r\nstrata,\" I said: \"most men would have preferred the horizontal position.\r\nIt used to be regarded as one of the standing rules of my old\r\nprofession, that the 'broad bed of a stone' is the best, and should be\r\nalways laid 'below.'\" \"A good rule for the land,\" replied Mr. Bremner,\r\n\"but no good rule for the sea. The greatest blunders are almost always\r\nperpetrated through the misapplication of good rules. On a coast like\r\nours, where boulders of a ton weight are rolled about with every storm\r\nlike pebbles, these stones, if placed on what a workman would term their\r\nbest beds, would be scattered along the shore like sea-wrack, by the\r\ngales of a single winter. In setting aside the prejudice,\" continued Mr.\r\nBremner, \"that what is indisputably the best bed for a stone on dry land\r\nis also the best bed in the water on an exposed coast, I reasoned\r\nthus:--The surf that dashes along the beach in times of tempest, and\r\nthat forms the enemy with which I have to contend, is not simply water,\r\nwith an onward impetus communicated to it by the wind and tide, and a\r\nreactive impetus in the opposite direction,--the effect of the backward\r\nrebound, and of its own weight, when raised by these propelling forces\r\nabove its average level of surface. True, it is all this; but it is also\r\nsomething more. As its white breadth of foam indicates, it is a subtile\r\nmixture of water and _air_, with a powerful _upward_ action,--a\r\nconsequence of the air struggling to effect its escape; and this upward\r\naction must be taken into account in our calculations, as certainly as\r\nthe other and more generally recognized actions. In striking against a\r\npiece of building, this subtile mixture dashes through the interstices\r\ninto the interior of the masonry, and, filling up all its cavities, has\r\nby its upward action, a tendency to _set the work afloat_. And the\r\nbroader the beds of the stones, of course the more extensive are the\r\nsurfaces which it has to act upon. One of these flat flags, ten feet by\r\nfour, and a foot in thickness, would present to this upheaving force, if\r\nplaced on end, a superficies of but _four_ square feet; whereas, if\r\nplaced on its broader base, it would present to it a superficies of\r\n_forty_ square feet. Obviously, then, with regard to this aerial\r\nupheaving force, that acts upon the masonry in a direction in which no\r\nprecautions are usually adopted to bind it fast,--for the existence of\r\nthe force itself is not taken into account,--the greater bed of the\r\nstone must be just ten times over a worse bed than its lesser one; and\r\non a tempestuous foam-encircled coast such as ours, this aerial\r\nupheaving force is in reality, though the builder may not know it, one\r\nof the most formidable forces with which he had to deal. And so, on\r\nthese principles, I ventured to set my stones on end,--on what was\r\ndeemed their _worst_, not their _best_ beds,--wedging them all fast\r\ntogether, like staves in an anker; and there, to the scandal of all the\r\nold rules, are they fast wedged still, firm as a rock.\" It was no\r\nordinary man that could have originated such reasonings on such a\r\nsubject, or that could have thrown himself so boldly, and to such\r\npractical effect, on the conclusions to which they led.\r\n\r\nMr. Bremner adverted, in the course of our conversation, to a singular\r\nappearance among the rocks a little to the east and south of the town\r\nof Wick, that had not, he said, attracted the notice it deserved. The\r\nsolid rock had been fractured by some tremendous blow, dealt to it\r\nexternally at a considerable height over the sea-level, and its detached\r\nmasses scattered about like the stones of an ill-built harbor broken up\r\nby a storm. The force, whatever its nature, had been enormously great.\r\nBlocks of some thirty or forty tons weight had been torn from out the\r\nsolid strata, and piled up in ruinous heaps, as if the compact precipice\r\nhad been a piece of loose brickwork, or had been driven into each other,\r\nas if, instead of being composed of perhaps the hardest and toughest\r\nsedimentary rock in the country, they had been formed of sun-dried clay.\r\n\"I brought,\" continued Mr. Bremner, \"one of your itinerant geological\r\nlecturers to the spot, to get his opinion; but he could say nothing\r\nabout the appearance: it was not in his books.\" \"I suspect,\" I replied,\r\n\"the phenomenon lies quite as much within your own province as within\r\nthat of the geological lecturer. It is in all probability an\r\nillustration, on a large scale, of those floating forces with which you\r\noperate on your foundered vessels, joined to the forces, laterally\r\nexerted, by which you drag them towards the shore. When the sea stood\r\nhigher, or the land lower, in the eras of the raised beaches, along what\r\nis now Caithness, the abrupt mural precipices by which your coast here\r\nis skirted must have secured a very considerable depth of water up to\r\nthe very edge of the land;--your coast-line must have resembled the side\r\nof a mole or wharf: and in that glacial period to which the thick\r\ndeposit of boulder-clay immediately over your harbor yonder belongs,\r\nicebergs of very considerable size must not unfrequently have brushed\r\nthe brows of your precipices. An iceberg from eighty to a hundred feet\r\nin thickness, and perhaps half a square mile in area, could not, in\r\nthis old state of things, have come in contact with these cliffs without\r\nfirst catching the ground outside; and such an iceberg, propelled by a\r\nfierce storm from the north-east, could not fail to lend the cliff with\r\nwhich it came in collision a tremendous blow. You will find that your\r\nshattered precipice marks, in all probability, the scene of a collision\r\nof this character: some hard-headed iceberg must have set itself to run\r\ndown the land, and got wrecked upon it for its pains.\" My theory, though\r\nmade somewhat in the dark,--for I had no opportunity of seeing the\r\nbroken precipice until after my return from Orkney,--seemed to satisfy\r\nMr. Bremner; nor, on a careful survey of the phenomenon, the solution of\r\nwhich it attempted, did I find occasion to modify or give it up.\r\n\r\nWith just knowledge enough of Mr. Bremner's peculiar province to\r\nappreciate his views, I was much impressed by their broad and practical\r\nsimplicity; and bethought me, as we conversed, that the character of the\r\nthinking, which, according to Addison, forms the staple of all writings\r\nof genius, and which he defines as \"simple but not obvious,\" is a\r\ncharacter which equally applies to _all_ good thinking, whatever its\r\nspecial department. Power rarely resides in ingenious complexities: it\r\nseems to eschew in every walk the elaborately attenuated and razor-edged\r\nmode of thinking,--the thinking akin to that of the old metaphysical\r\npoets,--and to select the broad and massive style. Hercules, in all the\r\nrepresentations of him which I have yet seen, is the _broad_ Hercules. I\r\nwas greatly struck by some of Mr. Bremner's views on deep-sea founding.\r\nHe showed me how, by a series of simple, but certainly not obvious\r\ncontrivances, which had a strong air of practicability about them, he\r\ncould lay down his erection, course by course, inshore, in a floating\r\ncaisson of peculiar construction, beginning a little beyond the low-ebb\r\nline, and warping out his work piecemeal, as it sank, till it had\r\nreached its proper place, in, if necessary, from ten to twelve fathoms\r\nwater, where, on a bottom previously prepared for it by the diving-bell,\r\nhe had means to make it take the ground exactly at the required line.\r\nThe difficulty and vast expense of building altogether by the bell would\r\nbe obviated, he said, by the contrivance, and a solidity given to the\r\nwork otherwise impossible in the circumstances: the stones could be laid\r\nin his floating caisson with a care as deliberate as on the land. Some\r\nof the anecdotes which he communicated to me on this occasion, connected\r\nwith his numerous achievements in weighing up foundered vessels, or in\r\nfloating off wrecked or stranded ones, were of singular interest; and I\r\nregretted that they should not be recorded in an autobiographical\r\nmemoir. Not a few of them were humorously told, and curiously\r\nillustrative of that general ignorance regarding the \"strength of\r\nmaterials\" in which the scientific world has been too strangely suffered\r\nto lie, in this the world's most mechanical age; so that what ought to\r\nbe questions of strict calculation are subjected to the guessings of a\r\nmere common sense, far from adequate, in many cases, to their proper\r\nresolution. \"I once raised a vessel,\" said Mr. Bremner,--\"a large\r\ncollier, chock-full of coal,--which an English projector had actually\r\nengaged to raise with huge bags of India rubber, inflated with air. But\r\nthe bags, of course taxed far beyond their strength, collapsed or burst;\r\nand so, when I succeeded in bringing the vessel up, through the\r\nemployment of more adequate means, I got not only ship and cargo, but\r\nalso a great deal of good India rubber to boot.\" Only a few months after\r\nI enjoyed the pleasure of this interview with the Brindley of Scotland,\r\nhe was called south, to the achievement of his greatest feat in at least\r\none special department,--a feat generally recognized and appreciated as\r\nthe most herculean of its kind ever performed,--the raising and warping\r\noff of the Great Britain steamer from her perilous bed in the sand of an\r\nexposed bay on the coast of Ireland. I was conscious of a feeling of\r\nsadness as, in parting with Mr. Bremner, I reflected, that a man so\r\nsingularly gifted should have been suffered to reach a period of life\r\nvery considerably advanced, in employments little suited to exert his\r\nextraordinary faculties, and which persons of the ordinary type could\r\nhave performed as well. Napoleon,--himself possessed of great\r\ngenius,--could have estimated more adequately than our British rulers\r\nthe value of such a man. Had Mr. Bremner been born a Frenchman, he would\r\nnot now be the mere agent of a steam company, in a third-rate seaport\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased, but the evening was gloomy and chill; and the\r\nOrcades, which, on clearing the Caithness coast, came as fully in view\r\nas the haze permitted, were enveloped in an undress of cloud and spray,\r\nthat showed off their flat low features to no advantage at all. The\r\nbold, picturesque Hebrides look well in any weather; but the level\r\nOrkney Islands, impressed everywhere, on at least their eastern coasts,\r\nby the comparatively tame character borne by the Old Red flagstones,\r\nwhen undisturbed by trap or the primary rocks, demand the full-dress\r\nauxiliaries of bright sun and clear sky, to render their charms patent.\r\nThen, however, in their sleek coats of emerald and purple, and\r\nsurrounded by their blue sparkling sounds and seas, with here a long\r\ndark wall of rock, that casts its shadow over the breaking waves, and\r\nthere a light fringe of sand and broken shells, they are, as I\r\nafterwards ascertained, not without their genuine beauties. But had they\r\nshared in the history of the neighboring Shetland group, that, according\r\nto some of the older historians, were suffered to lie uninhabited for\r\ncenturies after their first discovery, I would rather have been\r\ndisposed to marvel this evening, not that they had been unappropriated\r\nso long, but that they had been appropriated at all. The late member for\r\nOrkney, not yet unseated by his Shetland opponent, was one of the\r\npassengers in the steamboat; and, with an elderly man, an ambitious\r\nschoolmaster, strongly marked by the peculiarities of the genuine\r\ndominie, who had introduced himself to him as a brother voyager, he was\r\npacing the quarter-deck, evidently doing his best to exert, under an\r\nunintermittent hot-water _douche_ of queries, the patient courtesy of a\r\nMember of Parliament on a visit to his constituency. At length, however,\r\nthe troubler quitted him, and took his stand immediately beside me; and,\r\ntoo sanguinely concluding that I might take the same kind of liberty\r\nwith the schoolmaster that the schoolmaster had taken with the Member, I\r\naddressed to him a simple query in turn. But I had mistaken my man; the\r\nschoolmaster permitted to unknown passengers in humble russet no such\r\nsort of familiarities as those permitted by the Member; and so I met\r\nwith a prompt rebuff, that at once set me down. I was evidently a big,\r\nforward lad, who had taken a liberty with the master. It is, I suspect,\r\nscarce possible for a man, unless naturally very superior, to live among\r\nboys for some twenty or thirty years, exerting over them all the while a\r\ndespotic authority, without contracting those peculiarities of character\r\nwhich the master-spirits,--our Scots, Lambs, and Goldsmiths,--have\r\nembalmed with such exquisite truth in our literature, and which have\r\nhitherto militated against the practical realization of those\r\nunexceptionable abstractions in behalf of the status and standing of the\r\nteacher of youth which have been originated by men less in the habit of\r\nlooking about them than the poets. It is worth while remarking how\r\ninvariably the strong common sense of the Scotch people has run every\r\nscheme under water that, confounding the character of the \"village\r\nschoolmaster\" with that of the \"village clergyman,\" would demand from\r\nthe schoolmaster the clergyman's work.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the opening of the Pentland Frith, with its white surges and\r\ndark boiling eddies, and saw its twin lighthouses rising tall and\r\nghostly amid the fog on our lee. We then skirted the shores of South\r\nRonaldshay, of Burra, of Copinshay, and of Deerness; and, after doubling\r\nMoul Head, and threading the sound which separates Shapinshay from the\r\nMainland, we entered the Frith of Kirkwall, and caught, amid the\r\nuncertain light of the closing evening, our earliest glimpse of the\r\nancient Cathedral of St. Magnus. It seems at first sight as if standing\r\nsolitary, a huge hermit-like erection, at the bottom of a low bay,--for\r\nits humbler companions do not make themselves visible until we have\r\nentered the harbor by a mile or two more, when we begin to find that it\r\noccupies, not an uninhabited tract of shore, but the middle of a gray\r\nstraggling town, nearly a mile in length. We had just light enough to\r\nshow us, on landing, that the main thoroughfare of the place, very\r\nnarrow and very crooked, had been laid out, ere the country beyond had\r\ngot highways, or the proprietors carts and carriages, with an exclusive\r\neye to the necessities of the foot-passenger,--that many of the older\r\nhouses presented, as is common in our northern towns, their gables to\r\nthe street, and had narrow slips of closes running down along their\r\nfronts,--and that as we receded from the harbor, a goodly portion of\r\ntheir number bore about them an air of respectability, long maintained,\r\nbut now apparently touched by decay. I saw, in advance of one of the\r\nbuildings, several vigorous-looking planes, about forty feet in height,\r\nwhich, fenced by tall houses in front and rear, and flanked by the\r\ntortuosities of the street, had apparently forgotten that they were in\r\nOrkney, and had grown quite as well as the planes of public\r\nthoroughfares grow elsewhere. After an abortive attempt or two made in\r\nother quarters, I was successful in procuring lodgings for a few days in\r\nthe house of a respectable widow lady of the place, where I found\r\ncomfort and quiet on very moderate terms. The cast of faded gentility\r\nwhich attached to so many of the older houses of Kirkwall,--remnants of\r\na time when the wealthier Udallers of the Orkneys used to repair to\r\ntheir capital at the close of autumn, to while away in each other's\r\nsociety their dreary winters,--reminded me of the poet Malcolm's \"Sketch\r\nof the Borough,\"--a portrait for which Kirkwall is known to have\r\nsat,--and of the great revolution effected in its evening parties, when\r\n\"tea and turn-out\" yielded its place to \"tea and turn-in.\" But the\r\nchurchyard of the place, which I had seen, as I passed along, glimmering\r\nwith all its tombstones in the uncertain light, was all that remained to\r\nrepresent those \"great men of the burgh,\" who, according to the poet,\r\nused to \"pop in on its card and dancing assemblies, about the eleventh\r\nhour, resplendent in top-boots and scarlet vests,\" or of its\r\n\"suppression-of-vice sisterhood of moral old maids,\" who kept all their\r\nneighbors right by the terror of their tongues. I was somewhat in a\r\nmood, after my chill and hungry voyage, to recall with a hankering of\r\nregret the vision of its departed suppers, so luxuriously described in\r\nthe \"Sketch,\"--suppers at which \"large rounds of boiled beef smothered\r\nin cabbage, smoked geese, mutton hams, roasts of pork, and dishes of\r\ndog-fish and of Welsh rabbits melted in their own fat, were diluted by\r\ncopious draughts of strong home-brewed ale, and etherealized by gigantic\r\nbowls of rum punch.\" But the past, which is not ours, who, alas, can\r\nrecall! And, after discussing a juicy steak and a modest cup of tea, I\r\nfound I could regard with the indifferency of a philosopher, the\r\nperished suppers of Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nI quitted my lodgings for church next morning about three-quarters of an\r\nhour ere the service commenced; and, finding the doors shut, sauntered\r\nup the hill that rises immediately over the town. The thick gloomy\r\nweather had passed with the night; and a still, bright, clear-eyed\r\nSabbath looked cheerily down on green isle and blue sea. I was quite\r\nunprepared by any previous description, for the imposing assemblage of\r\nancient buildings which Kirkwall presents full in the foreground, when\r\nviewed from the road which ascends along this hilly slope to the\r\nuplands. So thickly are they massed together, that, seen from one\r\nspecial point of view, they seem a portion of some magnificent city in\r\nruins,--some such city though in a widely different style of\r\narchitecture, as Palmyra or Baalbec. The Cathedral of St. Magnus rises\r\non the right, the castle-palace of Earl Patrick Stuart on the left, the\r\nbishop's palace in the space between; and all three occupy sites so\r\ncontiguous, that a distance of some two or three hundred yards abreast\r\ngives the proper angle for taking in the whole group at a glance. I know\r\nno such group elsewhere in Scotland. The church and palace of Linlithgow\r\nare in such close proximity, that, seen together, relieved against the\r\nblue gleam of their lake, they form one magnificent pile; but we have\r\nhere a taller, and, notwithstanding its Saxon plainness, a nobler\r\nchurch, than that of the southern burgh, and at least one palace more.\r\nAnd the associations connected with the church, and at least one of the\r\npalaces ascend to a remoter and more picturesque antiquity. The\r\ncastle-palace of Earl Patrick dates from but the time of James the\r\nSixth; but in the palace of the bishop, old grim Haco died, after his\r\ndefeat at Largs, \"of grief,\" says Buchanan, \"for the loss of his army,\r\nand of a valiant youth his relation;\" and in the ancient Cathedral, his\r\nbody, previous to its removal to Norway, was interred for a winter. The\r\nchurch and palace belong to the obscure dawn of the national history,\r\nand were Norwegian for centuries before they were Scotch.\r\n\r\nAs I was coming down the hill at a snail's pace, I was overtaken by a\r\ncountryman on his way to church. \"Ye'll hae come,\" he said, addressing\r\nme, \"wi' the great man last night?\" \"I came in the steamer,\" I replied,\r\n\"with your Member, Mr. Dundas.\" \"O, aye,\" rejoined the man; \"but I'm no\r\nsure he'll be our Member next time. The Voluntaries yonder, ye see,\"\r\njerking his head, as he spoke, in the direction of the United Secession\r\nchapel of the place, \"are awfu' strong and unco radical; and the Free\r\nKirk folk will soon be as bad as them. But I belong to the\r\nEstablishment; and I side wi' Dundas.\" The aristocracy of Scotland\r\ncommitted, I am afraid, a sad blunder when they attempted strengthening\r\ntheir influence as a class by seizing hold of the Church patronages.\r\nThey have fared somewhat like those sailors of Ulysses who, in seeking\r\nto appropriate their master's wealth, let out the winds upon themselves;\r\nand there is now, in consequence, a perilous voyage and an uncertain\r\nlanding before them. It was the patronate wedge that struck from off the\r\nScottish Establishment at least nine-tenths of the Dissenters of the\r\nkingdom,--its Secession bodies, its Relief body, and, finally, its Free\r\nChurch denomination,--comprising in their aggregate amount a great and\r\ninfluential majority of the Scotch people. Our older Dissenters,--a\r\ncircumstance inevitable to their position as such,--have been thrown\r\ninto the movement party: the Free Church, in her present transition\r\nstate, sits loose to all the various political sections of the country;\r\nbut her natural tendency is towards the movement party also; and\r\nalready, in consequence, do our Scottish aristocracy possess greatly\r\nless political influence in the kingdom of which they own almost all\r\nthe soil, than that wielded by their brethren the Irish and English\r\naristocracy in their respective divisions of the empire. Were the\r\nrepresentation of England and Ireland as liberal as that of Scotland,\r\nand as little influenced by the aristocracy, Conservatism, on the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill, might have taken leave of office for\r\nevermore. And yet neither the English nor Irish are naturally so\r\nConservative as the Scotch. The patronate wedge, like that appropriated\r\nby Achan, has been disastrous to the people, for it has lost to them the\r\ngreat benefits of a religious Establishment, and very great these are;\r\nbut it threatens, as in the case of the sons of Carmi of old, to work\r\nmore serious evil to those by whom it was originally coveted,--\"evil to\r\nthemselves and all their house.\" As I approached the Free Church, a\r\nsquat, sun-burned, carnal-minded \"old wee wifie,\" who seemed passing\r\ntowards the Secession place of worship, after looking wistfully at my\r\ngray maud, and concluding for certain that I could not be other than a\r\nSouthland drover, came up to me, and asked, in a cautious whisper, \"Will\r\nye be wantin' a coo?\" I replied in the negative; and the wee wifie,\r\nafter casting a jealous glance at a group of grave-featured Free Church\r\nfolk in our immediate neighborhood, who would scarce have tolerated\r\nSabbath trading in a Seceder, tucked up her little blue cloak over her\r\nhead, and hied away to the chapel.\r\n\r\nIn the Free Church pulpit I recognized an old friend, to whom I\r\nintroduced myself at the close of the service, and by whom I was\r\nintroduced, in turn, to several intelligent members of his session, to\r\nwhose kindness I owed, on the following day, introductions to some of\r\nthe less accessible curiosities of the place. I rose betimes on the\r\nmorning of Monday, that I might have leisure enough before me to see\r\nthem all, and broke my first ground in Orkney as a geologist in a quarry\r\na few hundred yards to the south and east of the town. It is strange\r\nenough how frequently the explorer in the Old Red finds himself\r\nrestricted in a locality to well nigh a single organism,--an effect,\r\nprobably, of some gregarious instinct in the ancient fishes of this\r\nformation, similar to that which characterizes so many of the fishes of\r\nthe present time, or of some peculiarity in their constitution, which\r\nmade each choose for itself a peculiar habitat. In this quarry, though\r\nabounding in broken remains, I found scarce a single fragment which did\r\nnot belong to an exceedingly minute species of Coccosteus, of which my\r\nfirst specimen had been sent me a few years before by Mr. Robert Dick,\r\nfrom the neighborhood of Thurso, and which I at that time, judging from\r\nits general proportions, had set down as the young of the _Coccosteus\r\ncuspidatus_. Its apparent gregariousness, too, quite as marked at Thurso\r\nas in this quarry, had assisted, on the strength of an obvious enough\r\nanalogy, in leading to the conclusion. There are several species of the\r\nexisting fish, well known on our coasts, that, though solitary when\r\nfully grown, are gregarious when young. The coal-fish, which as the\r\nsillock of a few inches in length congregates by thousands, but as the\r\ncolum-saw of from two and a half to three feet is a solitary fish, forms\r\na familiar instance; and I had inferred that the Coccosteus, found\r\nsolitary, in most instances, when at its full size, had, like the\r\ncoal-fish, congregated in shoals when in a state of immaturity. But a\r\nmore careful examination of the specimens leads me to conclude that this\r\nminute gregarious Coccosteus, so abundant in this locality that its\r\nfragments thickly speckle the strata for hundreds of yards together--(in\r\none instance I found the dorsal plates of four individuals crowded into\r\na piece of flag barely six inches square)--was in reality a distinct\r\nspecies. Though not more than one-fourth the size, measured linearly, of\r\nthe _Coccosteus decipiens_, its plates exhibit as many of those lines\r\nof increment which gave to the occipital buckler of the creature its\r\ntortoise-like appearance, and through which plates of the buckler\r\nspecies were at first mistaken for those of a Chelonian, as are\r\nexhibited by plates of the larger kinds, with an area ten times as\r\ngreat; its tubercles, too, some of them of microscopic size, are as\r\nnumerous;--evidences, I think,--when we take into account that in the\r\nbulkier species the lines and tubercles increased in number with the\r\ngrowth of the plates, and that, once formed, they seem never to have\r\nbeen affected by the subsequent enlargement of the creature,--that this\r\nichthyolite was not an _immature_, but really a _miniature_ Coccosteus.\r\nWe may see on the plates of the full-grown Coccosteus, as on the shells\r\nof bivalves, such as _Cardium echinatum_, or on those of spiral\r\nunivalves, such as _Buccinum undatum_, the diminutive markings which\r\nthey bore when the creature was young; and on the plates of this species\r\nwe may detect a regular gradation of tubercles from the microscopic to\r\nthe minute, as we may see on the plates of the larger kinds a regular\r\ngradation from the minute to the fall-sized. The average length of the\r\ndwarf Coccosteus of Thurso and Kirkwall, taken from the snout to the\r\npointed termination of the dorsal plate, ranges from one and a-half to\r\ntwo inches; its entire length from head to tail probably from three to\r\nfour. It was from one of Mr. Dick's specimens of this species that I\r\nfirst determined the true position of the eyes of the Coccosteus,--a\r\nposition which some of my lately-found ichthyolites conclusively\r\ndemonstrate, and which Agassiz, in his restoration, deceived by\r\nill-preserved specimens, has fixed at a point considerably more lateral\r\nand posterior, and where eyes would have been of greatly less use to the\r\nanimal. About a field's breadth below this quarry of the _Coccosteus\r\nminor_,--if I may take the liberty of extemporizing a name, until such\r\ntime as some person better qualified furnishes the creature with a more\r\ncharacteristic one,--there are the remains, consisting of fosse and\r\nrampart, with a single cannon lying red and honeycombed amid the ruins,\r\nof one of Cromwell's forts, built to protect the town against the\r\nassaults of an enemy from the sea. In the few and stormy years during\r\nwhich this ablest of British governors ruled over Scotland, he seems to\r\nhave exercised a singularly vigilant eye. The claims on his protection\r\nof even the remote Kirkwall did not escape him.\r\n\r\nThe antiquities of the burgh next engaged me; and, as became its dignity\r\nand importance, I began with the Cathedral, a building imposing enough\r\nto rank among the most impressive of its class anywhere, but whose\r\npeculiar _setting_ in this remote northern country, joined to the\r\nassociations of its early history with the Scandinavian Rollos, Sigurds,\r\nEinars, and Hacos of our dingier chronicles, serve greatly to enhance\r\nits interest. It is a noble pile, built of a dark-tinted Old Red\r\nSandstone,--a stone which, though by much too sombre for adequately\r\ndeveloping the elegancies of the Grecian or Roman architecture, to which\r\na light delicate tone of color seems indispensable, harmonizes well with\r\nthe massier and less florid styles of the Gothic. The round arch of that\r\nancient Norman school which was at one time so generally recognized as\r\nSaxon, prevails in the edifice, and marks out its older portions. A few\r\nof the arches present on their ringstones those characteristic toothed\r\nand zig-zag ornaments that are of not unfamiliar occurrence on the round\r\nsquat doorways of the older parish churches of England; but by much the\r\ngreater number exhibit merely a few rude mouldings, that bend over\r\nponderous columns and massive capitals, unfretted by the tool of the\r\ncarver. Though of colossal magnificence, the exterior of the edifice\r\nyields in effect, as in all true Gothic buildings,--for the Gothic is\r\ngreatest in what the Grecian is least,--to the sombre sublimity of the\r\ninterior. The nave, flanked by the dim deep aisles, and by a double row\r\nof smooth-stemmed gigantic columns, supporting each a double tier of\r\nponderous arches, and the transepts, with their three tiers of small\r\nNorman windows, and their bold semi-circular arcs, demurely gay with\r\ntoothed or angular carvings, that speak of the days of Rolf and\r\nTorfeinar, are singularly fine,--far superior to aught else of the kind\r\nin Scotland; and a happy accident has added greatly to their effect. A\r\nrare Byssus,--the _Byssus aeruginosa_ of Linnaeus,--the _Leprasia\r\naeruginosa_ of modern botanists,--one of those gloomy vegetables of the\r\ndamp cave and dark mine whose true habitat is rather under than upon the\r\nearth, has crept over arch, and column, and broad bare wall, and given\r\nto well nigh the entire interior of the building a close-fitted lining\r\nof dark velvety green, which, like the Attic rust of an ancient medal,\r\nforms an appropriate covering to the sculpturings which it enwraps\r\nwithout concealing, and harmonizes with at once the dim light and the\r\nantique architecture. Where the sun streamed upon it, high over head,\r\nthrough the narrow windows above, it reminded me of a pall of rich green\r\nvelvet. It seems subject, on some of the lower mouldings and damper\r\nrecesses, especially amid the tombs and in the aisles, to a decomposing\r\nmildew, which eats into it in fantastic map-like lines of mingled black\r\nand gray, so resembling Runic fret-work, that I had some difficulty in\r\nconvincing myself that the tracery which it forms,--singularly\r\nappropriate to the architecture,--was not the effect of design. The\r\nchoir and chancel of the edifice, which at the time of my visit were\r\nstill employed as the parish church of Kirkwall, and had become a \"world\r\ntoo wide\" for the shrunken congregation, are more modern and ornate than\r\nthe nave and transepts; and the round arch gives place, in at least\r\ntheir windows, to the pointed one. But the unique consistency of the\r\npile is scarce at all disturbed by this mixture of styles. It is truly\r\nwonderful how completely the forgotten architects of the darker ages\r\ncontrived to avoid those gross offences against good taste and artistic\r\nfeeling into which their successors of a greatly more enlightened time\r\nare continually falling. Instead of idly courting ornament for its own\r\nsake, they must have had as their proposed object the production of some\r\ndefinite effect, or the development of some special sentiment. It was\r\nperhaps well for them, too, that they were not so overladen as our\r\nmodern architects with the _learning_ of their profession. Extensive\r\nknowledge requires great judgment to guide it. If that high genius which\r\ncan impart its own homogeneous character to very various materials be\r\nwanting, the more multifarious a man's ideas become, the more is he in\r\ndanger of straining after a heterogeneous patch-work excellence, which\r\nis but excellence in its components, and deformity as a whole. Every new\r\nvista opened up to him on what has been produced in his art elsewhere\r\npresents to him merely a new avenue of error. His mind becomes a mere\r\ndamaged kaleidoscope, full of little broken pieces of the fair and the\r\nexquisite, but devoid of that nicely reflective machinery which can\r\nalone cast the fragments into shapes of a chaste and harmonious beauty.\r\n\r\nJudging from the sculptures of St. Magnus, the stone-cutter seems to\r\nhave had but an indifferent command of his trade in Orkney, when there\r\nwas a good deal known about it elsewhere. And yet the rudeness of his\r\nwork here, much in keeping with the ponderous simplicity of the\r\narchitecture, serves but to link on the pile to a more venerable\r\nantiquity, and speaks less of the inartificial than of the remote. I saw\r\na grotesque hatchment high up among the arches, that, with the uncouth\r\ncarvings below, served to throw some light on the introduction into\r\necclesiastical edifices of those ludicrous sculptures that seem so\r\nincongruously foreign to the proper use and character of such places.\r\nThe painter had set himself, with, I doubt not, fair moral intent, to\r\nexhibit a skeleton wrapped up in a winding-sheet; but, like the unlucky\r\nartist immortalized by Gifford, who proposed painting a lion, but\r\nproduced merely a dog, his skill had failed in seconding his intentions,\r\nand, instead of achieving a Death in a shroud, he had achieved but a\r\nmonkey grinning in a towel. His contemporaries, however, unlike those of\r\nGifford's artist, do not seem to have found out the mistake, and so the\r\nbetowelled monkey has come to hold a conspicuous place among the\r\nsolemnities of the Cathedral. It does not seem difficult to conceive how\r\nunintentional ludicrosities of this nature, introduced into\r\necclesiastical erections in ages too little critical to distinguish\r\nbetween what the workman had purposed doing and what he had done, might\r\ncome to be regarded, in a less earnest but more knowing age, as\r\nprecedents for the introduction of the intentionally comic and\r\ngrotesque. Innocent accidental monkeys in towels may have thus served to\r\nusher into serious neighborhoods monkeys in towels that were such with\r\nmalice _prepense_.\r\n\r\nI was shown an opening in the masonry, rather more than a man's height\r\nfrom the floor, that marked where a square narrow cell, formed in the\r\nthickness of the wall, had been laid open a few years before. And in the\r\ncell there was found depending from the middle of the roof a rusty iron\r\nchain, with a bit of barley-bread attached. What could the chain and bit\r\nof bread have meant? Had they dangled in the remote past over some\r\nnorthern Ugolino? or did they form in their dark narrow cell, without\r\nair-hole or outlet, merely some of the reserve terrors of the\r\nCathedral, efficient in bending to the authority of the Church the\r\nrebellious monk or refractory nun? Ere quitting the building, I scaled\r\nthe great tower,--considerably less tall, it is said, than its\r\npredecessor, which was destroyed by lightning about two hundred years\r\nago, but quite tall enough to command an extensive, and, though bare,\r\nnot unimpressive prospect. Two arms of the sea, that cut so deeply into\r\nthe mainland on its opposite sides as to narrow it into a flat neck\r\nlittle more than a mile and a half in breadth, stretch away in long\r\nvista, the one to the south, and the other to the north; and so\r\nimmediately is the Cathedral perched on the isthmus between, as to be\r\nnearly equally conspicuous from both. It forms in each, to the\r\ninward-bound vessel, the terminal object in the landscape. There was not\r\nmuch to admire in the town immediately beneath, with its roofs of gray\r\nslate,--almost the only parts of it visible from this point of\r\nview,--and its bare treeless suburbs; nor yet in the tract of mingled\r\nhill and moor on either hand, into which the island expands from the\r\nnarrow neck, like the two ends of a sand-glass; but the long withdrawing\r\nocean-avenues between, that seemed approaching from south and north to\r\nkiss the feet of the proud Cathedral,--avenues here and there enlivened\r\non their ground of deep blue by a sail, and fringed on the lee--for the\r\nwind blew freshly in the clear sunshine--with their border of dazzling\r\nwhite, were objects worth while climbing the tower to see. Ere my\r\ndescent, my guide hammered out of the tower-bells, on my special behalf,\r\nsomewhat, I daresay, to the astonishment of the burghers below, a set of\r\nchimes handed down entire, in all the notes, from the times of the\r\nmonks, from which also the four fine bells of the Cathedral have\r\ndescended as an heirloom to the burgh. The chimes would have delighted\r\nthe heart of old Lisle Bowles, the poet of\r\n\r\n \"Well-tun'd bell's enchanting harmony.\"\r\n\r\nI could, however, have preferred listening to their music, though it\r\nseemed really very sweet, a few hundred yards further away; and the\r\nquiet clerical poet,--the restorer of the Sonnet in England, would, I\r\ndoubt not, have been of the same mind. The oft-recurring tones of those\r\nbells that ring throughout his verse, and to which Byron wickedly\r\nproposed adding a _cap_, form but an ingredient of the poetry in which\r\nhe describes them; and they are represented always as distant tones,\r\nthat, while they mingle with the softer harmonies of nature, never\r\noverpower them.\r\n\r\n \"How sweet the tuneful bells responsive peal!\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n And, hark! with lessening cadence now they fall,\r\n   And now, along the white and level tide\r\n   They fling their melancholy music wide!\r\n Bidding me many a tender thought recall\r\n Of happy hours departed, and those years\r\n   When, from an antique tower, ere life's fair prime,\r\n   The mournful mazes of their mingling chime\r\n First wak'd my wondering childhood into tears!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Cathedral I passed to the mansion of Old Earl Patrick,--a\r\nstately ruin, in the more ornate castellated style of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It stands in the middle of a dense thicket of what are _trying_\r\nto be trees, and have so far succeeded, that they conceal, on one of the\r\nsides, the lower story of the building, and rise over the _spring_ of\r\nthe large richly-decorated turrets. These last form so much nearer the\r\nbase of the edifice than is common in our old castles, that they exhibit\r\nthe appearance rather of hanging towers than of turrets,--of towers with\r\ntheir foundations cut away. The projecting windows, with their deep\r\nmouldings, square mullions, and cruciform shot-holes, are rich\r\nspecimens of their peculiar style; and, with the double-windowed turrets\r\nwith which they range, they communicate a sort of _high-relief_ effect\r\nto the entire erection, \"the exterior proportions and ornaments of\r\nwhich,\" says Sir Walter Scott, in his Journal, \"are very handsome.\"\r\nThough a roofless and broken ruin, with the rank grass waving on its\r\nwalls, it is still a piece of very solid masonry, and must have been\r\nrather stiff working as a quarry. Some painstaking burgher had, I found,\r\nmade a desperate attempt on one of the huge chimney lintels of the great\r\nhall of the erection,--an apartment which Sir Walter greatly admired,\r\nand in which he lays the scene in the \"Pirate\" between Cleveland and\r\nJack Bunce, but the lintel, a curious example of what, in the exercise\r\nof a little Irish liberty, is sometimes termed a _rectilinear arch_,\r\ndefied his utmost efforts; and, after half-picking out the keystone, he\r\nhad to give it up in despair. The bishop's palace, of which a handsome\r\nold tower still remains tolerably entire, also served for a quarry in\r\nits day; and I was scarce sufficiently distressed to learn, that on\r\nalmost the last occasion on which it had been wrought for this purpose,\r\none of the two men engaged in the employment suffered a stone, which he\r\nhad loosed out of the wall, to drop on the head of his companion, who\r\nstood watching for it below, and killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     The Bishop's Palace at Orkney--Haco the Norwegian--Icelandic\r\n     Chronicle respecting his Expedition to Scotland--His Death--Removal\r\n     of his Remains to Norway--Why Norwegian Invasion\r\n     ceased--Straw-plaiting--The Lassies of Orkney--Orkney Type of\r\n     Countenance--Celtic and Scandinavian--An accomplished\r\n     Antiquary--Old Manuscripts--An old Tune-book--Manuscript Letter of\r\n     Mary Queen of Scots--Letters of General Monck--The fearless\r\n     Covenanter--Cave of the Rebels--Why the tragedy of \"Gustavus Vasa\"\r\n     was prohibited--Quarry of Pickoquoy--Its Fossil Shells--Journey to\r\n     Stromness--Scenery--Birth-place of Malcolm, the Poet--His\r\n     History--One of his Poems--His Brother a Free Church Minister--New\r\n     Scenery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"upper story\" of the bishop's palace, in which grim old Haco\r\ndied,--thanks to the economic burghers who converted the stately ruin\r\ninto a quarry,--has wholly disappeared. Though the death of this last of\r\nthe Norwegian invaders does not date more than ten years previous to the\r\nbirth of the Bruce, it seems to belong, notwithstanding, to a different\r\nand greatly more ancient period of Scottish history; as if it came under\r\nthe influence of a sort of aerial perspective, similar to that which\r\nmakes a neighboring hill in a fog appear as remote as a distant mountain\r\nwhen the atmosphere is clearer. Our national wars with the English were\r\nrendered familiar to our country folk of the last age, and for centuries\r\nbefore by the old Scotch \"_Makkaris,_\" Barbour and Blind Harry, and in\r\nour own times by the glowing narratives of Sir Walter Scott,--magicians\r\nwho, unlike those ancient sorcerers that used to darken the air with\r\ntheir incantations, possessed the rare power of dissipating the mists\r\nand vapors of the historic atmosphere, and rendering it transparent. But\r\nwe had no such chroniclers of the time, though only half an age further\r\nremoved into the past,\r\n\r\n \"When Norse and Danish galleys plied\r\n Their oars within the Frith of Clyde,\r\n And floated Haco's banner trim\r\n Above Norweyan warriors grim,\r\n Savage of heart and large of limb.\"\r\n\r\nAnd hence the thick haze in which it is enveloped. Curiously enough,\r\nhowever, this period, during which the wild Scot had to contend with the\r\nstill wilder wanderers of Scandinavia in fierce combats that he was too\r\nlittle skilful to record, and which appears so obscure and remote to his\r\ndescendants, presents a phase comparatively near, and an outline\r\nproportionally sharp and well-defined to the intelligent peasantry of\r\nIceland. _Their_ Barbours and Blind Harries came a few ages sooner than\r\nours, and the fog, in consequence, rose earlier; and so, while Scotch\r\nantiquaries of no mean standing can say almost nothing about the\r\nexpedition or death-bed of Haco, even the humbler Icelanders, taught\r\nfrom their Sagas in the long winter nights, can tell how, harassed by\r\nanxiety and fatigue, the monarch sickened, and recovered, and sickened\r\nagain; and how, dying in the bishop's palace, his body was interred for\r\na winter in the Cathedral, and then borne in spring to the burying-place\r\nof his ancestors in Norway. The only clear vista on the death of Haco\r\nwhich now exists is that presented by an Icelandic chronicler: to which,\r\nas it seems so little known even in Orkney that the burying-place of the\r\nmonarch is still occasionally sought for in the Cathedral, I must\r\nintroduce the reader. I quote from an extract containing the account of\r\nHaco's expedition against Scotland, which was translated from the\r\noriginal Icelandic by the Rev. James Johnstone, chaplain to his\r\nBritannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary at the court of Denmark, and\r\nappeared in the \"Edinburgh Magazine\" for 1787.\r\n\r\n\"King Haco,\" says the chronicler, \"now in the seven and fortieth year of\r\nhis reign, had spent the summer in watchfulness and anxiety. Being often\r\ncalled to deliberate with his captains, he had enjoyed little rest; and\r\nwhen he arrived at Kirkwall, he was confined to his bed by his disorder.\r\nHaving lain for some nights, the illness abated, and he was on foot for\r\nthree days. On the first day he walked about in his apartments; on the\r\nsecond he attended at the bishop's chapel to hear mass; and on the third\r\nhe went to Magnus Church, and walked round the shrine of St. Magnus,\r\nEarl of Orkney. He then ordered a bath to be prepared, and got himself\r\nshaved. Some nights after, he relapsed, and took again to his bed.\r\nDuring his sickness he ordered the Bible and Latin authors to be read to\r\nhim. But finding his spirits were too much fatigued by reflecting on\r\nwhat he had heard, he desired Norwegian books might be read to him night\r\nand day: first the lives of saints; and, when they were ended, he made\r\nhis attendants read the Chronicles of our Kings, from Holden the Black,\r\nand so of all the Norwegian monarchs in succession, one after the other.\r\nThe king still found his disorder increasing. He therefore took into\r\nconsideration the pay to be given to his troops, and commanded that a\r\nmerk of fine silver should be given to each courtier, and half a merk to\r\neach of the masters of the lights, chamberlain, and other attendants on\r\nhis person. He ordered all the silver-plate belonging to his table to be\r\nweighed, and to be distributed if his standard silver fell short....\r\nKing Haco received extreme unction on the night before the festival of\r\nSt. Lucia. Thorgisl, Bishop of Stravanger, Gilbert, Bishop of Hainar,\r\nHenry, Bishop of Orkney, Albert Thorleif and many other learned men,\r\nwere present; and, before the unction, all present bade the king\r\nfarewell with a kiss.... The festival of the Virgin St. Lucia happened\r\non a Thursday; and on the Saturday after, the king's disorder increased\r\nto such a degree, that he lost the use of his speech; and at midnight\r\nAlmighty God called King Haco out of this mortal life. This was matter\r\nof great grief to all those who attended, and to most of those who heard\r\nof the event. The following barons were present at the death of the\r\nking:--Briniolf Johnson, Erling Alfson, John Drottning, Ronald Urka, and\r\nsome domestics who had been near the king's person during his illness.\r\nImmediately on the decease of the king, bishops and learned men were\r\nsent for to sing mass.... On Sunday the royal corpse was carried to the\r\nupper hall, and laid on a bier. The body was clothed in a rich garb,\r\nwith a garland on its head, and dressed out as became a crowned monarch.\r\nThe masters of the lights stood with tapers in their hands, and the\r\nwhole hall was illuminated. All the people came to see the body, which\r\nappeared beautiful and animated; and the king's countenance was as fair\r\nand ruddy as while he was alive. It was some alleviation of the deep\r\nsorrow of the beholders to see the corpse of their departed sovereign so\r\ndecorated. High mass was then sung for the deceased. The nobility kept\r\nwatch by the body during the night. On Monday the remains of King Haco\r\nwere carried to St. Magnus Church, where they lay in state that night.\r\nOn Tuesday the royal corpse was put in a coffin, and buried in the choir\r\nof St. Magnus Church, near the steps leading to the shrine of St.\r\nMagnus, Earl of Orkney. The tomb was then closed, and a canopy was\r\nspread over it. It was also determined that watch should be kept over\r\nthe king's grave all winter. At Christmas the bishop and Andrew Plytt\r\nfurnished entertainments, as the king had directed; and good presents\r\nwere given to all the soldiers. King Haco had given orders that his\r\nremains should be carried east to Norway, and buried near his fathers\r\nand relatives. Towards the end of winter, therefore, that great vessel\r\nwhich he had in the west was launched, and soon got ready. On Ash\r\nWednesday the corpse of King Haco was taken out of the ground: this\r\nhappened the third of the nones of March. The courtiers followed the\r\ncorpse to Skalpeid, where the ship lay, and which was chiefly under the\r\ndirection of the Bishop Thorgisl and Andrew Plytt. They put to sea on\r\nthe first Saturday in Lent; but, meeting with hard weather, they steered\r\nfor Silavog. From this place they wrote letters to Prince Magnus,\r\nacquainting him with the news, and then sailed for Bergen. They arrived\r\nat Laxavog before the festival of St. Benedict. On that day Prince\r\nMagnus rowed out to meet the corpse. The ship was brought near to the\r\nking's palace, and the body was carried up to a summer-house. Next\r\nmorning the corpse was removed to Christ's Church, and was attended by\r\nPrince Magnus, the two queens, the courtiers, and the town's people. The\r\nbody was then interred in the choir of Christ's Church; and Prince\r\nMagnus addressed a long and gracious speech to those who attended the\r\nfuneral procession. All the multitude present were much affected, and\r\nexpressed great sorrow of mind.\"\r\n\r\nSo far the Icelandic chronicle. Each age has as certainly its own mode\r\nof telling its stories as of adjusting its dress or setting its cap; and\r\nthe mode of this northern historian is somewhat prolix. I am not sure,\r\nhowever, whether I would not prefer the simple minuteness with which he\r\ndwells on every little circumstance, to that dissertative style of\r\nhistory characteristic of a more reflective age, that for series of\r\nfacts substitutes bundles of theories. Cowper well describes the\r\nhistorians of this latter school, and shows how, on selecting some\r\nlittle-known personage of a remote time as their hero,\r\n\r\n \"They disentangle from the puzzled skein\r\n In which obscurity has wrapped them up,\r\n The threads of politic and shrewd design\r\n That ran through all his purposes, and charge\r\n His mind with meanings that he never had,\r\n Or, having, kept concealed.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen it elaborately argued by a writer of this class, that those\r\nwasting incursions of the Northmen which must have been such terrible\r\nplagues to the southern and western countries of Europe, ceased in\r\nconsequence of their conversion to Christianity; for that, under the\r\nhumanizing influence of religion, they staid at home, and cultivated the\r\narts of peace. But the hypothesis is, I fear, not very tenable.\r\nChristianity, in even a purer form than that in which it first found its\r\nway among the ancient Scandinavians, and when at least as generally\r\nrecognized nationally as it ever was by the subjects of Haco, has failed\r\nto put down the trade of aggressive war. It did not prevent honest,\r\nobstinate George the Third from warring with the Americans or the\r\nFrench: it only led him to enjoin a day of thanksgiving when his troops\r\nhad slaughtered a great many of the enemy, and to ordain a fast when the\r\nenemy had slaughtered, in turn, a great many of his troops. And Haco,\r\nwho, though he preferred the lives of the saints, and even of his\r\nancestors, who could not have been very great saints, to the Scriptures,\r\nseems, for a king, to have been a not undevout man in his way, and yet\r\nappears to have had as few compunctions visitings on the score of his\r\nScottish war as George the Third on that of the French or the American\r\none. Christianity, too, ere his invasion of Scotland, had been for a\r\nconsiderable time established in his dominions, and ought, were the\r\ntheory a true one, to have operated sooner. The Cathedral of St. Magnus,\r\nwhen he walked round the shrine of its patron saint, was at least a\r\ncentury old. The true secret of the cessation of Norwegian invasion\r\nseems to have been the consolidation, under vigorous princes, of the\r\ncountries which had lain open to it,--a circumstance which, in the later\r\nattempts of the invaders, led to results similar to those which broke\r\nthe heart of tough old Haco, in the bishop's palace at Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nFrom the ruins I passed to the town, and spent a not uninstructive\r\nhalf-hour in sauntering along the streets in the quiet of the evening,\r\nacquainting myself with the general aspect of the people. I marked, as\r\none of the peculiar features of the place, groups of tidily-dressed\r\nyoung women, engaged at the close-heads with their straw plait,--the\r\nprevailing manufacture of the town,--and enjoying at the same time the\r\nfresh air and an easy chat. The special contribution made by the lassies\r\nof Orkney to the dress of their female neighbors all over the empire,\r\nhas led to much tasteful dressing among themselves. Orkney, on its gala,\r\ndays, is a land of ladies. What seems to be the typical countenance of\r\nthese islands unites an aquiline but not prominent nose to an oval face.\r\nIn the ordinary Scotch and English countenance, when the nose is\r\naquiline it is also prominent, and the face is thin and angular, as if\r\nthe additional height of the central feature had been given it at the\r\nexpense of the cheeks, and of lateral shavings from off the chin. The\r\nhard Duke-of-Wellington face is illustrative of this type. But in the\r\naquiline type of Orkney the countenance is softer and fuller, and, in at\r\nleast the female face, the general contour greatly more handsome. Dr.\r\nKombst, in his ethnographic map of Britain and Ireland, gives to the\r\ncoast of Caithness and the Shetland Islands a purely Scandinavian\r\npeople, but to the Orkneys a mixed race, which he designates the\r\nScandinavian-Gaelic. I would be inclined, however,--preferring rather to\r\nfound on those traits of person and character that are still patent,\r\nthan on the unauthenticated statements of uncertain history,--to regard\r\nthe people as essentially one from the northern extremity of Shetland to\r\nthe Ord Hill of Caithness. Beyond the Ord Hill, and on to the northern\r\nshores of the Frith of Cromarty, we find, though unnoted on the map, a\r\ndifferent race,--a race strongly marked by the Celtic lineaments, and\r\nspeaking the Gaelic tongue. On the southern side of the Frith, and\r\nextending on to the Bay of Munlochy, the purely Scandinavian race again\r\noccurs. The sailors of the Danish fleet which four years ago accompanied\r\nthe Crown Prince in his expedition to the Faroe Islands were astonished\r\nwhen, on landing at Cromarty, they recognized in the people the familiar\r\ncast of countenance and feature that marked their country folk and\r\nrelatives at home; and found that they were simply Scandinavians like\r\nthemselves, who, having forgotten their Danish, spoke Scotch instead.\r\nRather more than a mile to the west of the fishing village of Avoch\r\nthere commences a Celtic district, which stretches on from Munlochy to\r\nthe river Nairne; beyond which the Scandinavian and Teutonic-Scandinavian\r\nborder that fringes the eastern coast of Scotland extends unbroken\r\nsouthwards through Moray, Banff, and Aberdeen, on to Forfar, Fife, the\r\nLothians, and the Mearns. These two intercalated patches of Celtic people\r\nin the northern tract,--that extending from the Ord Hill to the Cromarty\r\nFrith, and that extending from the Bay of Munlochy to the Nairne,--still\r\nretaining, as they do, after the lapse of ages, a sharp distinctness of\r\nboundary in respect of language, character, and personal appearance, are\r\nsurely great curiosities. The writer of these chapters was born on the\r\nextreme edge of one of these patches, scarce a mile distant from a\r\nGaelic-speaking population; and yet, though his humble ancestors were\r\nlocated on the spot for centuries, he can find trace among them of but one\r\nCeltic name; and their language was exclusively the Lowland Scotch. For\r\nmany ages the two races, like oil and water, refused to mix.\r\n\r\nI spent the evening very agreeably with one of the Free Church elders of\r\nthe place, Mr. George Petrie, an accomplished antiquary; and found that\r\nhis love of the antique, joined to an official connection with the\r\ncounty, had cast into his keeping a number of curious old papers of the\r\nsixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries,--not in the least\r\nconnected, some of them, with the legal and civic records of the place,\r\nbut which had somehow stuck around these, in their course of\r\ntransmission from one age to another, as a float of brushwood in a river\r\noccasionally brings down along with it, entangled in its folds, uprooted\r\nplants and aquatic weeds, that would otherwise have disappeared in the\r\ncataracts and eddies of the upper reaches of the stream. Dead as they\r\nseemed, spotted with mildew, and fretted by the moth, I found them\r\ncuriously charged with what had once been intellect and emotion, hopes\r\nand fears, stern business and light amusement. I saw, among the other\r\nmanuscripts, a thin slip of a book, filled with jottings, in the antique\r\nsquare-headed style of notation, of old Scotch tunes, apparently the\r\nwork of some musical county-clerk of Orkney in the seventeenth century;\r\nbut the paper, in a miserable state of decay, was blotted crimson and\r\nyellow with the rotting damps, and the ink so faded, that the notation\r\nof scarce any single piece in the collection seemed legible throughout.\r\nLess valuable and more modern, though curious from their eccentricity,\r\nthere lay, in company with the music, several pieces of verse, addressed\r\nby some Orcadian Claud Halcro of the last age, to some local patron, in\r\na vein of compliment rich and stiff as a piece of ancient brocade. A\r\nperemptory letter, bearing the autograph signature of Mary Queen of\r\nScots, to Torquil McLeod of Dunvegan, who had been on the eve, it would\r\nseem, of marrying a daughter of Donald of the Isles, gave the Skye\r\nchieftain, \"to wit\" that, as he was of the blood royal of Scotland, he\r\ncould form no matrimonial alliance without the royal permission,--a\r\npermission which, in the case in point, was not to be granted. It served\r\nto show that the woman who so ill liked to be thwarted in her own amours\r\ncould, in her character as the Queen, deal despotically enough with the\r\nlove affairs of other people. Side by side with the letter of Mary there\r\nwere several not less peremptory documents of the times of the\r\nCommonwealth, addressed to the Sheriff of Orkney and Shetland, in the\r\nname of his Highness the Lord Protector, and that bore the signature of\r\nGeorge Monck. I found them to consist chiefly of dunning letters,--such\r\nletters as those duns write who have victorious armies at their\r\nback,--for large sums of money, the assessments laid on the Orkneys by\r\nCromwell. Another series of letters, some ten or twelve years later in\r\ntheir date, form portions of the history of a worthy covenanting\r\nminister, the Rev. Alexander Smith of Colvine, banished to North\r\nRonaldshay from the extreme south of Scotland, for the offence of\r\npreaching the gospel, and holding meetings for social worship in his own\r\nhouse; and, as if to demonstrate his incorrigibility, one of the\r\nseries,--a letter under his own hand, addressed from his island prison\r\nto the Sheriff-Depute in Kirkwall,--showed him as determined and\r\npersevering in the offence as ever. It was written immediately after his\r\narrival. \"The poor inhabitants,\" says the writer, \"so many as I have\r\nyet seen, have received me with much joy. _I intend, if the Lord will,\r\nto preach Christ to them next Lord's day_, without the least mixture of\r\nanything that may smell of sedition or rebellion. If I be farther\r\ntroubled for yt, I resolve to suffer with meekness and patience.\" The\r\nGalloway minister must have been an honest man. Deeming preaching his\r\ntrue vocation,--a vocation from the exercise of which he dared not\r\ncease, lest he should render himself obnoxious to the woe referred to by\r\nthe apostle,--he yet could not steal a march on even the Sheriff, whose\r\nprofessional duty it was to prevent him from doing _his_; and so he\r\nfairly warned him that he proposed breaking the law. The next set of\r\npapers in the collection dated after the Revolution, and were full\r\ncharged with an enthusiastic Jacobitisin, which seems to have been a\r\nprevalent sentiment in Orkney from the death of Queen Anne, until the\r\ndisastrous defeat at Culloden quenched in blood the hopes of the party.\r\nThere is a deep cave still shown on the shores of Westray, within sight\r\nof the forlorn Patmos of the poor Covenanter, in which, when the sun got\r\non the Whig side of the hedge, twelve gentlemen, who had been engaged in\r\nthe rebellion of 1745, concealed themselves for a whole winter. So\r\nperseveringly were they sought after, that during the whole time they\r\ndared not once light a fire, nor attempt fishing from the rocks to\r\nsupply themselves with food; and, though they escaped the search, they\r\nnever, it is said, completely recovered the horrors of their term of\r\ndreary seclusion, but bore about with them, in broken constitutions, the\r\neffects of the hardships to which they had been subjected. They must\r\nhave had full time and opportunity, during that miserable winter, for\r\ntesting the justice of the policy that had sent poor Smith into exile,\r\nfrom his snug southern parish in the Presbytery of Dumfries, to the\r\nremotest island of the Orkneys. The great lesson taught in Providence\r\nduring the seventeenth and part of the eighteenth century to our\r\nScottish country folk seems to have been the lesson of toleration; and\r\nas they were slow, stubborn scholars, the lash was very frequently and\r\nvery severely applied. One of the Jacobite papers of Mr. Petrie's\r\ncollection,--a triumphal poem on the victory of Gladsmuir,--which, if\r\nless poetical than the Ode of Hamilton of Bangour on the same subject,\r\nis in no degree less curious,--serves to throw very decided light on a\r\npassage in literary history which puzzled Dr. Johnson, and which scarce\r\nany one would think of going to Orkney to settle.\r\n\r\nJohnson states, in his Life of the poet Thomson, that the \"first\r\noperation\" of the act passed in 1739 \"for licensing plays\" was the\r\n\"prohibition of 'Gustavus Vasa,' a tragedy of Mr. Brook.\" \"Why such a\r\nwork should be obstructed,\" he adds, \"it is hard to discover.\" We learn\r\nelsewhere,--from the compiler of the \"Modern Universal History,\" if I\r\nremember aright,--that \"so popular did the prohibitory order of the Lord\r\nChamberlain render the play,\" that, \"on its publication the same year,\r\nnot less than a thousand pounds were the clear produce.\" It was not,\r\nhowever, until more than sixty years after, when both Johnson and Brook\r\nwere in their graves, that it was deemed safe to license it for the\r\nstage. Now, the fact that a drama, in itself as little dangerous as\r\n\"Cato\" or \"Douglas,\" should have been prohibited by the Government of\r\nthe day, in the first instance, and should have brought the author, on\r\nits publication, so large a sum in the second, can be accounted for only\r\nby a reference to the keen partisanship of the period, and the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of parties. The Jacobites, taught by the rebellion of 1715\r\nat once the value of the Highlands and the incompetency of the\r\nChevalier St. George as a leader, had begun to fix their hopes on the\r\nChevalier's son, Charles Edward, at that time a young but promising lad;\r\nand, with the tragedy of Brook before them, neither they, nor the\r\nEnglish Government of the day could have failed to see the foreigner\r\nGeorge the Second typified--unintentionally, surely, on the part of\r\nBrook, who was a \"Prince of Wales\" Whig--in the foreigner Christiern\r\nthe Second, the Scotch Highlanders in the Mountaineers of Dalecarlia,\r\nand the young Prince in Gustavus. In the Jacobite manuscript of Mr.\r\nPetrie's collection, the parallelism is broadly traced; nor is it in the\r\nleast probable, as the poem is a piece of sad mediocrity throughout,\r\nthat it is a parallelism which was originated by its writer. It must\r\nhave been that of his party; and led, I doubt not, five years before, to\r\nthe prohibition of Brook's tragedy, and to the singular success which\r\nattended its publication. The passage in the manuscript suggestive of\r\nthis view takes the form of an address to the victorious prince, and\r\nruns as follows:--\r\n\r\n \"Meanwhile, unguarded youth, thou stoodst alone;\r\n The cruel Tyrant urged his Armie on;\r\n But Truth and Goodness were the Best of Arms;\r\n And, fearless Prince, Thou smil'd at Threatened harms.\r\n Thus, Glorious Vasa worked in Swedish mines,--\r\n Thus, Helpless, Saw his Enemy's Designs,--\r\n Till, roused, his Hardy Highlanders arose,\r\n And poured Destruction on their foreign foes.\"\r\n\r\nI rose betimes next morning, and crossed the Peerie [little] Sea, a\r\nshallow prolongation of the Bay of Kirkwall, cut off from the main sea\r\nby an artificial mound, to the quarry of Pickoquoy, somewhat notable,\r\nonly a few years ago, as the sole locality in which shells had been\r\ndetected in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland. But these have since been\r\nfound in the neighborhood of Thurso, by Mr. Robert Dick, associated\r\nwith bones and plates of the Asterolepis, and by Mr. William Watt on the\r\nopposite side of the Mainland of Orkney, at Marwick Head. So far as has\r\nyet been ascertained, they are all of one species, and more nearly\r\nresemble a small Cyclas than any other shell. They are, however, more\r\ndeeply sulcated in concentric lines, drawn, as if by a pair of\r\ncompasses, from the umbone, and somewhat resembling those of the genus\r\nAstarte, than any species of Cyclas with which I am acquainted. In all\r\nthe specimens I have yet seen, it appears to be rather a thick dark\r\nepidermis that survives, than the shell which it covered; nay, it seems\r\nnot impossible that to its thick epidermis, originally an essentially\r\ndifferent substance from that which composed the calcareous case, the\r\nshell may have owed its preservation as a fossil; while other shells,\r\nits contemporaries, from the circumstance of their having been\r\nunfurnished with any such covering, may have failed to leave any trace\r\nof their existence behind them. It seems at least difficult to conceive\r\nof a sea inhabited by many genera of fishes, each divided into several\r\nspecies, and yet furnished with but one species of shell. I found the\r\nquarry of Pickoquoy,--a deep excavation only a few yards beyond the\r\nhigh-water mark, and some two or three yards under the high-water\r\nlevel,--deserted by the quarrymen, and filled to the brim by the\r\noverflowing of a small stream. I succeeded, however, in detecting its\r\nshells _in situ_. They seem restricted chiefly to a single stratum,\r\nscarcely half an inch in thickness, and lie, not thinly scattered over\r\nthe platform which they occupy, but impinging on each other, like all\r\nthe gregarious shells, in thickly-set groups and clusters. There occur\r\namong them occasional scales of Dipteri; and on some of the fragments of\r\nrock long exposed around the quarry-mouth to the weather I found them\r\nassuming a pale nacreous gloss,--an effect, it is not improbable, of\r\ntheir still retaining, attached to the epidermis, a thin film of the\r\noriginal shell. The world's history must be vastly more voluminous now,\r\nand greatly more varied in its contents, than when the stratum which\r\nthey occupy formed the upper layer of a muddy sea-bottom, and they\r\nopened their valves by myriads, to prey on the organic atoms which\r\nformed their food, or shut them again, startled by the shadow of the\r\nDipterus, as he descended from the upper depths of the water to prey\r\nupon them in turn. The palate of this ancient ganoid is furnished with a\r\ncurious dental apparatus, formed apparenly, like that of the recent\r\nwolf-fish, for the purpose of crushing shells.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-day I set out by the mail-gig for Stromness. For the first few\r\nmiles the road winds through a bare solitary valley, overlooked by\r\nungainly heath-covered hills of no great altitude, though quite tall\r\nenough to prevent the traveller from seeing anything but themselves. As\r\nhe passes on, the valley opens in front on an arm of the sea, over which\r\nthe range of hills on the right abruptly terminates, while that on the\r\nleft deflects into a line nearly parallel to the shore, leaving a\r\ncomparatively level strip of moory land, rather more than a mile in\r\nbreadth, between the steeper acclivities and the beach. A tall naked\r\nhouse rises between the road and the sea. Two low islands immediately\r\nbehind it, only a few acres in extent,--one of them bearing a small ruin\r\non its apex,--give a little variety to the central point in the prospect\r\nwhich the naked house forms; but the arm of the sea, bordered, at the\r\ntime I passed, by a broad brown selvage of sea-weed, is as tame and flat\r\nas a Dutch lake; the background beyond, a long monotonous ridge, is bare\r\nand treeless; and in front lies the brown moory plain, bordered by the\r\ndull line of hills and darkened by scattered stacks of peat.\r\n\r\nThe scene is not at all such a one as a poet would, for its own sake,\r\ndelight to fancy; and yet, in the recollection of at least one very\r\npleasing poet, its hills, and islands, and blue arm of the sea, its\r\nbrown moory plain, and tall naked house rising in the midst, must have\r\nbeen surrounded by a sunlit atmosphere of love and desire, bright enough\r\nto impart to even its tamest features a glow of exquisiteness and\r\nbeauty. Malcolm the poet was born, and spent his years of boyhood and\r\nearly youth, in the tall naked house; and the surrounding landscape is\r\nthat to which he refers in his \"Tales of Flood and Field,\" as rising in\r\nimagination before him, bright in the red gleam of the setting sun,\r\nwhen, on the steep slopes of the Pyrenees, the \"silent stars of night\r\nwere twinkling high over his head,\" and the \"tents of the soldiery\r\nglimmering pale through the gloom.\" The tall house is the manse of the\r\nparish of Frith and Stennis; and the poet was the son of the Rev. John\r\nMalcolm, its minister. Here, when yet a mere lad, dreaming, in the quiet\r\nobscurity of an Orkney parish, far removed from the seat of war and the\r\nliterary circles, of poetic celebrity and military renown, he addressed\r\na letter to the Duke of Kent, the father of our Sovereign Lady the\r\nreigning Monarch, expressing an ardent wish to obtain a commission in\r\nthe army then engaged in the Peninsula. The letter was such as to excite\r\nthe interest of his Royal Highness, who replied to it by return of post,\r\nrequesting the writer to proceed forthwith to London; for which he\r\nimmediately set out, and was received by the Duke with courtesy and\r\nkindness. He was instructed by him to take ship for Spain, in which he\r\narrived as volunteer; and, joining the army, engaged at the time in the\r\nsiege of St. Sebastian, under General Graham, he was promoted shortly\r\nafter, through the influence of his generous patron, to a lieutenancy in\r\nthe 42d Highlanders. He served in that distinguished regiment on to the\r\nclosing campaign of the Pyrenees; but received at the battle of Toulouse\r\na wound so severe as to render him ever after incapable of active bodily\r\nexertion; and so he had to retire from the army on half-pay, and a\r\npension honorably earned. The history of his career as a soldier he has\r\ntold with singular interest, in one of the earlier volumes of\r\n\"Constable's Miscellany;\" and his poems abound in snatches of\r\ndescription painfully true, drawn from his experience of the military\r\nlife,--of scenes of stern misery and grim desolation, of injuries\r\nreceived, and of sufferings inflicted,--that must have contrasted sadly\r\nin his mind, in their character as gross realities, with the dreamy\r\nvisions of conquest and glory in which he had indulged at an earlier\r\ntime. The ruin of St. Sebastian, complete enough, and attended with\r\ncircumstances of the horrible extreme enough, to appal men long\r\nacquainted with the trade of war, must have powerfully impressed an\r\nimaginative susceptible lad, fresh from the domesticities of a rural\r\nmanse, in whose quiet neighborhood the voice of battle had not been\r\nheard for centuries, and surrounded by a simple people, remarkable for\r\nthe respect which they bear to human life. In all probability, the power\r\nevinced in his description of the siege, and of the utter desolation in\r\nwhich it terminated, is in part owing to the fresh impressibility of his\r\nmind at the time. Such, at least, was my feeling regarding it, as I\r\ncaught myself muttering some of its more graphic passages, and saw, from\r\nthe degree of alarm evinced by the boy who drove the mail-gig, that the\r\nsounds were not quite lost in the rattle of that somewhat rickety\r\nvehicle, and that he had come to entertain serious doubts respecting the\r\nsanity of his passenger:--\r\n\r\n \"Sebastian, when I saw thee last,\r\n   It was in Desolation's day,\r\n As through thy voiceless streets I passed,\r\n   Thy piles in heaps of rubbish lay;\r\n The roofless fragments of each wall\r\n Bore many a dent of shell and ball;\r\n With blood were all thy gateways red,\r\n And thou,--a city of the dead!\r\n\r\n   With fire and sword thy walks were swept:\r\n Exploded mines thy streets had heaped\r\n In hills of rubbish; they had been\r\n Traversed by gabion and fascine,\r\n With cannon lowering in the rear\r\n In dark array,--a deadly tier,--\r\n Whose thunder-clouds, with fiery breath,\r\n Sent far around their iron death;\r\n The bursting shell, in fragments flung\r\n Athwart the skies, at midnight sung,\r\n Or, on its airy pathway sent,\r\n Its meteors sweep the firmament.\r\n Thy castle, towering o'er the shore,\r\n Keeled on its rock amidst the roar\r\n Of thousand thunders, for it stood\r\n In circle of a fiery flood;\r\n And crumbling masses fiercely sent\r\n From its high frowning battlement,\r\n Smote by the shot and whistling shell,\r\n With groan and crash in ruin fell.\r\n   Through desert streets the mourner passed,\r\n Midst-walls that spectral shadows east,\r\n Like some fair spirit wailing o'er\r\n The failed scenes it loved of yore;\r\n No human voice was heard to bless\r\n That place of waste and loneliness.\r\n\r\n   I saw at eve the night-bird fly,\r\n And vulture dimly flitting by,\r\n To revel o'er each morsel stolen\r\n From the cold corse, all black and swoln\r\n That on the shattered ramparts lay,\r\n Of him who perished yesterday,--\r\n Of him whose pestilential steam\r\n Rose reeking on the morning beam,--\r\n Whose fearful fragments, nearly gone,\r\n Were blackening from the bleaching bone.\r\n\r\n   The house-dog bounded o'er each scene\r\n Where cisterns had so lately been:\r\n Away in frantic haste he sprung,\r\n And sought to cool his burning tongue.\r\n He howled, and to his famished cry\r\n The dreary echoes gave reply;\r\n And owlet's dirge, through shadows dim,\r\n Rolled back in sad response to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe father was succeeded in his parish by the brother of Malcolm,--a\r\ngentleman to whom, during my stay in Orkney, I took the liberty of\r\nintroducing myself in his snug little Free Church manse at the head of\r\nthe bay, and in whose possession I found the only portrait of the poet\r\nwhich exists. It is that of a handsome and interesting looking _young_\r\nman, though taken not many years before his death; for, like the greater\r\nnumber of his class, he did not live to be an old one, dying under\r\nforty. His brother the clergyman kindly accompanied me to two quarries\r\nin the neighborhood of his new domicil, which I found, like almost all\r\nthe dry-stone fences of the district, speckled with scales, occipital\r\nplates, and gill-covers, of Osteolepides and Dipteri, but containing no\r\nentire ichthyolites. He had taken his side in the Church controversy, he\r\ntold me, firmly, but quietly; and when the Disruption came, and he found\r\nit necessary to quit the old manse, which had been a home to his family\r\nfor well nigh two generations, and in which both he and his brother had\r\nbeen born, he scarce knew what his people were to do, nor in what\r\nproportion he was to have followers among them. Somewhat to his\r\nsurprise, however, they came out with him almost to a man; so that his\r\nsuccessor in the parish church had sometimes, he understood, to preach\r\nto congregations scarcely exceeding half a dozen. I had learned\r\nelsewhere how thoroughly Mr. Malcolm was loved and respected by his\r\nparishioners; and that unconsciousness on his own part of the strength\r\nof their affection and esteem, which his statement evinced, formed, I\r\nthought, a very pleasing trait, and one that harmonized well with the\r\nfinely-toned unobtrusiveness and unconscious elegance which\r\ncharacterized the genius of his deceased brother. A little beyond the\r\nFree Church manse the road ascends between stone walls, abounding in\r\nfragments of ichthyolites, weathered blue by exposure to the sun and\r\nwind; and the top of the eminence forms the water-shed in this part of\r\nthe Mainland, and introduces the traveller to a scene entirely new. The\r\nprospect is of considerable extent; and, what seems strange in Orkney,\r\nnowhere presents the traveller,--though it contains its large inland\r\nlake,--with a glimpse of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     Hills of Orkney--Their Geologic Composition--Scene of Scott's\r\n     \"Pirate\"--Stromness--Geology of the District--\"Seeking\r\n     beasts\"--Conglomerate in contact with Granite--A palaeozoic Hudson's\r\n     Bay--Thickness of Conglomerate of Orkney--Oldest Vertebrate yet\r\n     discovered in Orkney--Its Size--Figure of a characteristic plate of\r\n     the Asterolepis--Peculiarity of Old Red Fishes--Length of the\r\n     Asterolepis--A rich Ichthyolite Bed--Arrangement of the\r\n     Layers--Queries as to the Cause of it--Minerals--An abandoned\r\n     Mine--A lost Vessel--Kelp for Iodine--A dangerous Coast--Incidents\r\n     of Shipwreck--Hospitality--Stromness Museum--Diplopterus mistaken\r\n     for Dipterus--Their Resemblances and Differences--Visit to a\r\n     remarkable Stack--Paring the Soil for Fuel, and consequent\r\n     Barrenness--Description of the Stack--Wave-formed Caves--Height to\r\n     which the Surf rises.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Orkneys, like the mainland of Scotland, exhibit their higher hills\r\nand precipices on their western coasts: the Ward Hill of Hoy attains to\r\nan elevation of sixteen hundred feet; and there are some of the\r\nprecipices which skirt the island of which it forms so conspicuous a\r\nfeature, that rise sheer over the breakers from eight hundred to a\r\nthousand. Unlike, however, the arrangement on the mainland, it is the\r\nnewer rocks that attain to the higher elevations; the heights of Hoy are\r\ncomposed of that arenaceous upper member of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone,--the last formed of the Palaeozoic deposits of Orkney,--which\r\noverlies the ichthyolitic flagstones and shales of Caithness at Dunnet\r\nHead, and the ichthyolitic nodular beds of Inverness, Ross, and\r\nCromarty, at Culloden, Tarbet Ness, within the Northern Sutor, and along\r\nthe bleak ridge of the Maolbuie. It is simply a tall upper story of the\r\nformation, erected along the western line of coast in the Orkneys, which\r\nthe eastern line wholly wants. Its screen of hills forms a noble\r\nbackground to the prospect which opens on the traveller as he ascends\r\nthe eminence beyond the Free Church manse of Frith and Stennis. A large\r\nlake, bare and treeless, like all the other lakes and lochs of Orkney,\r\nbut picturesque of outline, and divided into an upper and lower sheet of\r\nwater by two low, long promontories, that jut out from opposite sides,\r\nand so nearly meet as to be connected by a threadlike line of road, half\r\nmound, half bridge, occupies the middle distance. There are moory hills\r\nand a few cottages in front; and on the promontories, conspicuous in the\r\nlandscape, from the relief furnished by the blue ground of the\r\nsurrounding waters, stand the tall stones of Stennis,--one group on the\r\nnorthern promontory, the other on the south. A gray old-fashioned house,\r\nof no very imposing appearance, rises between the road and the lake. It\r\nis the house of Stennis, or Turmister, in which Scott places some of the\r\nconcluding scenes of the \"Pirate,\" and from which he makes Cleveland and\r\nhis fantastic admirer Jack Bunce witness the final engagement, in the\r\nbay of Stromness, between the Halcyon sloop of war and the savage Goffe.\r\nNor does it matter anything that neither sea nor vessels can be seen\r\nfrom the house of Turmister: the fact which would be so fatal to a\r\ndishonest historian tells with no effect against the honest \"_maker_,\"\r\nresponsible for but the management of his tale.\r\n\r\nI got on to Stromness; and finding, after making myself comfortable in\r\nmy inn, that I had a fine bright evening still before me, longer by some\r\nthree or four degrees of north latitude than the July evenings of\r\nEdinburgh, I set out, hammer in hand, to explore. Stromness is a long,\r\nnarrow, irregular strip of a town, fairly thrust by a steep hill into\r\nthe sea, on which it encroaches in a broken line of wharf-like bulwarks,\r\nalong which, at high water, vessels of a hundred tons burden float so\r\nimmediately beside the houses, that their pennants on gala days wave\r\nover the chimney tops. The steep hill forms part of a granitic axis,\r\nabout six miles in length by a mile in breadth, which forms the backbone\r\nof the district, and against which the Great Conglomerate and lower\r\nschists of the Old Red are upturned at a rather high angle. It is\r\nwrapped round in some places by a thin caul of the stratified primary\r\nrocks. Immediately over the town, on the brow of the eminence, where the\r\ngranitic axis had been laid bare in digging a foundation for the Free\r\nChurch manse, I saw numerous masses of schistose-gneiss, passing in some\r\nof the beds into a coarse-grained mica-schist, and a lustrous\r\nhornblendic slate, that had been quarried from over it, and which may be\r\nstill seen built up into the garden-wall of the erection. I walked out\r\ntowards the west, to examine the junction of the granite and the Great\r\nConglomerate, where it is laid bare by the sea, little more than a\r\nquarter of a mile outside the town. There was a horde of noisy urchins a\r\nlittle beyond the inn, who, having seen me alight from the mail-gig, had\r\ndetermined in their own minds that I was engaged in the political\r\ncanvass going forward at the time, but had not quite ascertained my\r\nside. They now divided into two parties; and when the one, as I passed,\r\nset up a \"Hurra for Dundas,\" the other met them from the opposite side\r\nof the street, with a counter cry of \"Anderson forever.\" Immediately\r\nafter clearing the houses, I was accosted by a man from the country.\r\n\"Ye'll be seeking beasts,\" he said: \"what price are cattle gi'en the\r\nnoo?\" \"Yes, seeking _beasts_,\" I replied, \"but very old ones: I have\r\ncome to hammer your rocks for petrified fish.\" \"I see, I see,\" said the\r\nman; \"I took ye by ye'er gray plaid for a drover; but I ken something\r\nabout the stane fish too; there's lots o' them in the quarries at\r\nSkaill.\"\r\n\r\nI found the great Conglomerate in immediate contact with the granite,\r\nwhich is a ternary of the usual components, somewhat intermediate in\r\ncolor between that of Peterhead and Aberdeen, and which at this point\r\nbears none of the caul of stratified primary rock by which it is\r\noverlaid on the brow of the hill. When the great Conglomerate, which is\r\nmainly composed of it here, was in the act of forming, this granite must\r\nhave been one of the surface rocks of the locality, and in no respect a\r\ndifferent stone from what it is now. The widely-spread Conglomerate base\r\nof the Old Red Sandstone, which presents, over an area of so many\r\nthousand square miles, such an identity of character, that specimens\r\ntaken from the neighborhood of Lerwick, in Shetland, can scarce be\r\ndistinguished from specimens detached from the hills which rise over the\r\ngreat Caledonian Valley, contains in various places, as under the\r\nNorthern Sutor, for instance, and along the shores of Navity, fragments\r\nof rock which have not been detected _in situ_ in the districts in which\r\nthey occur as agglomerated pebbles. In general, however, we find it\r\ncomposed of the debris of those very granites and gneisses which, as in\r\nthe case of the granitic axis here, were forced through it, and through\r\nthe overlying deposits, by deep-seated convulsions, long posterior in\r\ndate to its formation. It appears to have been formed in a vast oceanic\r\nbasin of primary rock,--a Palaeozoic Hudson's or Baffin's Bay,--partially\r\nsurrounded, mayhap, by bare primary continents, swept by numerous\r\nstreams, rapid and headlong, and charged with the broken debris of the\r\ninhospitable regions which they drained. The graptolite-bearing\r\ngrauwacke of Banffshire seems to have been the only fossiliferous rock\r\nthat occurred throughout the extent of this ancient northern basin. The\r\nConglomerate of Orkney, like that of Moray and Ross, varies from fifty\r\nto a hundred yards in thickness. It is not overlaid in this section by\r\nthe thick bed of coarse-grained sandstone, so well-marked a member of\r\nthe formation at Cromarty, Nigg, and Gamrie, and along the northern\r\nshores of the Beauly Frith; but at once passes into those gray\r\nbituminous flagstones so immensely developed in Caithness and the\r\nOrkneys. I traced the formation upwards this evening, walking along the\r\nedges of the upheaved strata, from where the Conglomerate leans against\r\nthe granite, till where it merges into the gray flagstones, and then\r\npursued these from older and lower to newer and higher layers, anxious\r\nto ascertain at what distance over the base the more ancient organisms\r\nof the system first appear, and what their character and kind. And\r\nlittle more than a hundred _yards_ over the granite, and somewhat less\r\nthan a hundred _feet_ over the upper stratum of the great Conglomerate,\r\nI found what I sought,--a well-marked bone, perhaps the oldest\r\nvertebrate remain yet discovered in Orkney, embedded in a light\r\ngrayish-colored layer of hard flag.\r\n\r\nWhat, asks the reader, was the character of the ancient denizen of the\r\nPalaeozoic basin of which it had formed a part? Was it a large or small\r\nfish, or of a high or low order? Not certainly of a low order, and by no\r\nmeans of a small size. The organism in the rock was a specimen of that\r\ncurious nail-shaped bone of the Asterolepis which occurs as a central\r\nridge in the single plate that occupies in this genus the wide curve of\r\nthe under jaw, and as it was fully five inches in length from head to\r\npoint, the plate to which it belonged must have measured ten inches\r\nacross, and the frontal occipital buckler with which it was associated,\r\none foot two inches in length (not including the three accessory plates\r\nat the nape), by ten inches in breadth. And if built, as it probably\r\nwas, in the same massy proportions as its brother Coelacanths the\r\nHoloptychius or Glyptolepis, the individual to which the nail-shaped\r\nbone belonged must have been, judging from the size of the corresponding\r\nparts in these ichthyolites, at least twice as large an animal as the\r\nsplendid Clashbennie Holoptychius of the Upper Old Red, now in the\r\nBritish Museum. The bulkiest icthyolites yet found in any of the\r\ndivisions of the Old Red system are of the genus Asterolepis; and to\r\nthis genus, and to evidently an individual of no inconsiderable size,\r\nthis oldest of the organisms of the Orkney belonged. I was so interested\r\nin the fact, that before leaving this part of the country, I brought Dr.\r\nGarson, Stromness, and Mr. William Watt, jun., Skaill, both very\r\nintelligent palaeontologists, to mark the place and character of the\r\nfossil, that they might be able to point it out to geological visitors\r\nin the future, or, if they preferred removing it to their town Museum,\r\nto indicate to them the stratum in which it had lain. For the present, I\r\nmerely request the reader to mark, in the passing, that the most ancient\r\norganic remain yet found in the Old Red of this part of the country,\r\nnay, judging from its place, one of the most ancient yet found in\r\nScotland,--so far as I know, absolutely the _most_ ancient,--belonged to\r\na ganoid as bulky as a large porpoise, and which, as shown by its teeth\r\nand jaws, possessed that peculiar organization which characterized the\r\nreptile fish of the Upper Devonian and Carboniferous periods. As there\r\nare, however, no calculations more doubtful or more to be suspected than\r\nthose on which the size and bulk of the extinct animals are determined\r\nfrom some surviving fragment of their remains,--plate or bone,--I must\r\nattempt laying before the scientific reader at least a portion of the\r\ndata on which I found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis figure represents not inadequately one of the most characteristic\r\nplates of the Asterolepis. A very considerable fragment of what seems to\r\nbe the same plate has been figured by Agassiz from a cast of one of the\r\nhuge specimens of Professor Asmus (\"Old Red,\" Table 32, Fig. 13); but\r\nas no evidence regarding its true place had turned up at the time it was\r\nsupposed by the naturalist to form part of the opercular covering of the\r\nanimal. It belonged, however, to a different portion of the head. In\r\nalmost all the fish that appear at our tables the space which occurs\r\nwithin the arched sweep of the lower jaws is mainly occupied by a\r\ncomplicated osseous mechanism, known to anatomists as the hyoid bone and\r\nbranchiostegous rays; and which serves both to support the branchial\r\narches and the branchiostegous membrane. Now, in the fish of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, if we except some of the Acanthodians, we find no trace of\r\nthis piece of mechanism: the arched space is covered over with dermal\r\nplates of bone, as a window is filled up with panes. Three plates,\r\nresembling very considerably the three divisions of a pointed Gothic\r\nwindow, furnished with a single central mullion, divided atop into two\r\nbranches, occupied the space in the genera Osteolepis and Diplopterus;\r\nand two plates resembling the divisions of a pointed Gothic window,\r\nwhose single central mullion does _not_ branch atop, filled it up in the\r\ngenera Holoptychius and Glyptolepis. In the genus Asterolepis this\r\narch-shaped space was occupied, as I have said, by a single plate,--that\r\nrepresented in the wood-cut; and the nail-shaped bone rose on its\r\ninternal surface along the centre,--the nail-head resting immediately\r\nbeneath the centre of the arch, and the nail-point bordering on the\r\nisthmus below, at which the two shoulder-bones terminated. Now, in all\r\nthe specimens which I have yet examined, the form and proportions of\r\nthis plate are such that it can be very nearly inscribed in a\r\nsemi-circle, of which the length of the nail is the radius. A nail five\r\ninches in length must have belonged to a plate ten inches in its longer\r\ndiameter. I have ascertained further, that this longer diameter was\r\nequal to the shorter diameter of the creature's frontal buckler,\r\nmeasured across about two thirds of its entire length from the nape; and\r\nthat a transverse diameter of ten inches at this point was associated in\r\nthe buckler with a longitudinal diameter of fourteen inches from the\r\nnape to the snout. Thus five inches along the nail represent fourteen\r\ninches along the occipital shield. The proportion, however, which the\r\nlatter bore to the entire body in this genus has still to be determined.\r\nThe corresponding frontal shield in the Coccosteus was equal to about\r\none-fifth the creature's entire length, and in the Osteolepis and\r\nDiplopterus, to nearly one-seventh its length; while the length of the\r\n_Glyptolepis leptopterus_, a fish of the same family as the Asterolepis,\r\nwas about five and a half times that of its occipital shield. If the\r\nAsterolepis was formed in the proportions of the Diplopterus, the\r\nancient individual to which this nail-like bone belonged must have been\r\nabout eight feet two inches in length; but if moulded, as it more\r\nprobably was, in the proportions of the Glyptolepis, only six feet five\r\ninches. All the Coelacanths, however, were exceedingly massive in\r\nproportion to their length; they were fish built in the square,\r\nmuscular, thick-set, Dirk-Hatterick and Balfour-of-Burley style; and of\r\nthe Russian specimens, some of the larger bones must have belonged to\r\nindividuals of from twice to thrice the length of the Stromness one.\r\n\r\nPassing upwards along the strata, step by step, as along a fallen stair,\r\neach stratum presenting a nearly perpendicular front, but losing, in the\r\ndownward slant of the _tread_, as a carpenter would say, the height\r\nattained in the _rise_, I came, about a quarter of a mile farther to the\r\nwest, and several hundred feet higher in the formation, upon a fissile\r\ndark-colored bed, largely charged with ichthyolites. The fish I found\r\nranged in three layers,--the lower layer consisting almost exclusively\r\nof Dipterians, chiefly Osteolepides; the middle layer, of Acanthodians,\r\nof the genera Cheiracanthus and Diplacanthus; and the upper layer, of\r\nCephalaspides, mostly of one species, the _Coccosteus decipiens_. I\r\nfound exactly the same arrangement in a bed considerably higher in the\r\nsystem, which occurs a full mile farther on,--the Dipterians at the\r\nbottom, the Acanthodians in the middle, and the Cephalaspides atop; and\r\nwas informed by Mr. William Watt, a competent authority in the case,\r\nthat the arrangement is comparatively a common one in the quarries of\r\nOrkney. How account for the phenomenon? How account for the three\r\nstoreys, and the apportionment of the floors, like those of a great\r\ncity, each to its own specific class of society? Why should the first\r\nfloor be occupied by Osteolepides, the second by Cheiracanthi and their\r\ncongeners, and the third by Coccostei? Was the arrangement an effect of\r\nnormal differences in the constitutions of the several families,\r\noperated upon by some deleterious gas or mineral poison, which, though\r\nit eventually destroyed the whole, did not so simultaneously, but\r\nconsecutively,--the families of weakest constitution first, and the\r\nstrongest last? Or were they exterminated by some disease, that seized\r\nupon the families, not at once, but in succession? Or did they visit the\r\nlocality serially, as the haddock now visits our coasts in spring, and\r\nthe herring towards the close of summer; and were then killed off,\r\nwhether by poison or disease, as they came? These are questions which\r\nmay never be conclusively answered. It is well, however, to observe, as\r\na curious geological fact, that peculiar arrangement of the fossils by\r\nwhich they are suggested, and to record the various instances in which\r\nit occurs. The minerals which I remarked among the schists here as most\r\nabundant are a kind of black ironstone, exceedingly tough and hard,\r\noccurring in detached masses, and a variety of bright pyrites\r\ndisseminated among the darker flagstones, either as irregularly-formed,\r\nbrassy-looking concretions of small size, or spread out on their\r\nsurfaces in thin leaf-like films, that resemble, in some of the\r\nspecimens, the icy-foliage with which a severe frost encrusts a\r\nwindow-pane. Still further on I came upon a vein of galena; but a\r\nminer's excavation in the solid rock, a little above high-water mark,\r\nquite as dark and nearly as narrow as a fox-earth, showed me that it had\r\nbeen known long before, and, as the workings seemed to have been\r\ndeserted for ages, known to but little purpose. The crystals of ore,\r\nsmall and thinly scattered, are embedded in a matrix of barytes,\r\nstromnite, and other kindred minerals, and the thickness of the entire\r\nvein is not very considerable. I have since learned, from the\r\n\"Statistical Account of the Parish of Sandwick,\" that the workings of\r\nthe mine penetrate into the rock for about a hundred yards, but that it\r\nhas been long abandoned, \"as a speculation which would not pay.\"\r\n\r\nI observed scattered over the beach, in the neighborhood of the lead\r\nmine, considerable quantities of the hard chalk of England; and, judging\r\nthere could be no deposits of the hard chalk in this neighborhood, I\r\naddressed myself on my way back, to a kelp-burner engaged in wrapping up\r\nhis fire for the night with a thick covering of weed, to ascertain how\r\nit had come there. \"Ah, master,\" he replied, \"that chalk is all that\r\nremains of a fine large English vessel, that was knocked to pieces here\r\na few years ago. She was ballasted with the chalk; and as it is a light\r\nsort of stone, the surf has washed it ashore from that low reef in the\r\nmiddle of the tideway where she struck and broke up. Most of the\r\nsailors, poor fellows, lie in the old churchyard, beside the broken ruin\r\nyonder. It is a deadly shore this to seafaring-men.\" I had understood\r\nthat the kelp-trade was wholly at an end in Orkney; and, remarking that\r\nthe sea-weed which he employed was chiefly of one kind,--the long brown\r\nfronds of tang dried in the sun,--I inquired of him to what purpose the\r\nsubstance was now employed, seeing that barilla and the carbonate of\r\nsoda had supplanted it in the manufacture of soap and glass, and why he\r\nwas so particular in selecting his weed. \"It's some valuable medicine,\"\r\nhe said, \"that's made of the kelp now: I forget its name; but it's used\r\nfor bad sores and cancer; and we must be particular in our weed, for\r\nit's not every kind of weed that has the medicine in't. There's most of\r\nit, we're told, in the leaves of the tang.\" \"Is the name of the drug,\" I\r\nasked, \"iodine?\" \"Ay, that must be just it,\" he replied,--\"iodine; but\r\nit doesn't make such a demand for kelp as the glass and the soap.\" I\r\nafterwards learned that the kelp-burner's character of this strip of\r\ncoast, as peculiarly fatal to the mariner, was borne out by many a sad\r\ncasualty, too largely charged with the wild and the horrible to be\r\nlightly forgotten. The respected Free Church clergyman of Stromness, Mr.\r\nLearmonth, informed me that, ere the Disruption, while yet minister of\r\nthe parish, there were on one sad occasion eight dead bodies carried of\r\na Sabbath morning to his manse door. Some of the incidents connected\r\nwith these terrible shipwrecks, as related with much graphic effect by a\r\nboatman who carried me across the sound, on an exploratory ramble to the\r\nisland of Hoy, struck me as of a character considerably beyond the reach\r\nof the mere dealer in fiction. The master of one hapless vessel, a young\r\nman, had brought his wife and only child with him on the voyage destined\r\nto terminate so mournfully; and when the vessel first struck, he had\r\nrushed down to the cabin to bring them both on deck, as their only\r\nchance of safety. He had, however, unthinkingly shut the cabin-door\r\nafter him; a second tremendous blow, as not unfrequently happens in\r\nsuch cases, so affected the framework of the sides and deck, that the\r\ndoor was jammed fast in its frame. And long ere it could be cut\r\nopen,--for no human hand could unfasten it,--the vessel had filled to\r\nthe beams, and neither the master nor his wife and child were ever seen\r\nmore. In another ship, wrecked within a cable-length of the beach, the\r\nmate, a man of Herculean proportions, and a skilful swimmer, stripped\r\nand leaped overboard, not doubting his ability to reach the shore. But\r\nhe had failed to remark what in such circumstances is too often\r\nforgotten, that the element on which he flung himself, beaten into foam\r\nagainst the shallows, was, according to Mr. Bremner's shrewd definition,\r\nnot water, but a mixture of water and air, specifically lighter than the\r\nhuman body; and so at the shore, though so close at hand, he never\r\narrived, disappearing almost at the vessel's side. \"The ground was\r\nrough,\" said my informant, \"and the sea ran mountains high; and I can\r\nscarce tell you how I shuddered on finding, long ere his corpse was\r\nthrown up, his two eyes detached from their sockets, staring from a\r\nwreath of sea-weed.\" There is in this last circumstance, horrible enough\r\nsurely for the wildest German tale ever written, a unique singularity,\r\nwhich removes it beyond the reach of invention.\r\n\r\nAt my inn I found a pressing invitation awaiting me from the Free Church\r\nmanse, which I was urged to make my home so long as I remained in that\r\npart of the country. A geologist, however, fairly possessed by the\r\nenthusiasm without which weak man can accomplish nothing,--whether he be\r\na deer-stalker or mammoth-fancier, or angle for live salmon or dead\r\nPterichthyes,--has a trick of forgetting the right times of dining and\r\ntaking tea, and of throwing the burden of his bodily requirements on\r\nearly extempore breakfasts and late suppers; and so reporting myself a\r\nman of irregular habits and bad hours, whose movements could not in the\r\nleast be depended upon, I had to decline the hospitality which would\r\nfain have adopted me as its guest, notwithstanding the badness of the\r\ncharacter that, in common honesty, I had to certify as my own. Next\r\nmorning I breakfasted at the manse, and was introduced by Mr. Learmonth\r\nto two gentlemen of the place, who had been kindly invited to meet with\r\nme, and who, from their acquaintance with the geology of the district\r\nenabled me to make the best use of my time, by cutting direct on those\r\ncliffs and quarries in the neighborhood in which organic remains had\r\nbeen detected, instead of wearily re-discovering them for myself. There\r\nis a small but interesting museum in Stromness, rich in the fossils of\r\nthe locality; and I began the geologic business of the day by devoting\r\nan hour to the examination of its organisms, chiefly ichthyolites. I saw\r\namong them several good specimens of the genus Pterichthys, and of what\r\nis elsewhere one of the rarer genera of the Dipterians,--the\r\nDiplopterus. A well-marked individual of the latter genus had, I found,\r\nbeen misnamed Dipterus by some geological visitor who had recently come\r\nthe way,--a mistake which, as in both ichthyolites the fins are\r\nsimilarly placed, occasionally occurs, but which may be easily avoided,\r\nwhen the specimens are in a tolerable state of preservation, by taking\r\nnote of a few well-marked characteristics by which the genera are\r\ndistinguished. In both Dipterus and Diplopterus the bright enamel of the\r\nscales was thickly punctulated by microscopic points,--the exterior\r\nterminations of funnel-shaped openings, that communicated between the\r\nsurface and the cells of the middle table of the scale; but the form of\r\nthe scales themselves was different,--that of the Dipterus being nearly\r\ncircular, and that of the Diplopterus, save on the dorsal ridge,\r\nrhomboidal. Again, the lateral line of the Diplopterus was a raised\r\nline, running as a ridge along the scales; whereas that of the Dipterus\r\nwas a depressed one, existing as a furrow. Their heads, too, were\r\ncovered by an entirely dissimilar arrangement of plates. The rounded\r\nsnout-plate of the Diplopterus was suddenly contracted to nearly\r\none-half its breadth by two semi-circular inflections, which formed the\r\norbits of the eyes; full in the centre, a little above these, a minute,\r\nlozenge-shaped plate seemed as if inlaid in the larger one, the\r\nanalogue, apparently, of the anterior frontal; and over all there\r\nexpanded a broad plate, the superior frontal, half divided vertically by\r\na line drawn downwards from the nape, which, however, stopped short in\r\nthe middle; and fretted transversely by two small but deeply-indented\r\nrectangular marks, which, crossing from the central to two lateral\r\nplates, assumed the semblance of connecting pins. The snout of the\r\nDipterus was less round; it bore no mark of the eye-orbits; and the\r\nfrontal buckler, broader in proportion to its length than that of the\r\nDiplopterus, consisted of many more plates. I may here mention that the\r\nfrontal buckler of Diplopterus has not yet been figured nor described;\r\nwhereas that of Dipterus, though unknown as such, has been given to the\r\nworld as the occipital covering of a supposed Cephalaspian,--the\r\nPolyphractus. Polyphractus is, however, in reality a synonym for\r\nDipterus,--the one name being derived from a peculiarity of the animal's\r\nfins: the other, from the great number of its occipital plates. There is\r\nno science founded on mere observation that can be altogether free, in\r\nits earlier stages, from mistakes of this character,--mistakes to which\r\nthe palaeontologist, however skilful, is peculiarly liable. The teeth of\r\nthe two genera were essentially different. Those of the Dipterus,\r\nexclusively palatal, were blunt and squat, and ranged in two\r\nrectangular patches;[22] while those of the Diplopterus bristled along\r\nits jaws and were slender and sharp. Their tails, too, though both\r\nheterocercal, were diverse in their type. In each, an angular strip of\r\ngradually-diminishing scales,--a prolongation of the scaly coat which\r\nprotected the body, and which covered here a prolongation of the\r\nvertebral column,--ran on to the extreme termination of the upper lobe;\r\nbut there was in the Diplopterus a greatly larger development of fin on\r\nthe superior or dorsal side of the scaly strip than on that of the\r\nDipterus. If the caudal fin of the Osteolepis be divided longitudinally\r\ninto six equal parts, it will be found that one of these occurs on the\r\nupper side of the vertebral prolongation, and five on the under; in the\r\ncaudal fin of the Diplopterus so divided, rather more than _two_ parts\r\nwill be found to occur on the upper side, and rather less than four on\r\nthe under; while in the caudal fin of the Dipterus the development seems\r\nto have been restricted to the under side exclusively; at least, in none\r\nof the many individuals which I have examined have I found any trace of\r\ncaudal rays on the upper side. These are minute and somewhat trivial\r\nparticulars; but the geologist may find them of use; and the\r\nnon-geologist may be disposed to extend to them some little degree of\r\ntolerance, when he considers that they distinguished two largely\r\ndeveloped genera of animals, to which the Author of all did not deem it\r\nunworthy his wisdom to impart, in the act of creation, certain marked\r\npoints of resemblance, and other certain points of dissimilarity.\r\n\r\nFrom the Museum, accompanied by one of the gentlemen to whom Mr.\r\nLearmonth had introduced me at breakfast, and who obligingly undertook\r\nto act as my guide on the occasion, I set out to visit a remarkable\r\nstack on the sea-coast, about four miles north and west of Stromness. We\r\nscaled together the steep granitic hill immediately over the town, and\r\nthen cut on the stack, straight as the bird flies, across a trackless\r\ncommon, bare and stony, and miserably pared by the _flaughter_ spade.\r\nThe landed proprietors in this part of the mainland are very numerous,\r\nand their properties small; and there are vast breadths of undivided\r\ncommon that encircle their little estates, as the Atlantic encircles the\r\nOrkneys. But the state in which I found the unappropriated parts of the\r\ndistrict had in no degree the effect of making me an opponent of\r\nappropriation or the landholders. Our country, had it been left as a\r\nwhole to all its people, as the Communist desiderates, would ere now be\r\nof exceedingly little value to any portion of them. The soil of the\r\nOrkney commons has been so repeatedly pared off and carried away for\r\nfuel, that there are now wide tracts on which there is no more soil to\r\npare, and which present, for the original covering of peaty mould, a\r\ncontinuous surface of pale boulder-clay, here and there mottled by\r\ndetached tufts of scraggy heath, and here and there roughened by\r\nprojections of the underlying rock. All is unredeemable barrenness. On\r\nthe other hand, wherever a bit of private property appears, though in\r\nthe immediate neighborhood of these ruined wastes, the surface is\r\nswarded over, and the soil is the better, not the worse, for the\r\nservices which it has rendered to man in the past. Whatever the Chartist\r\nand the Leveller may think of the matter, it is, I find, virtually on\r\nbehalf of the many that the soil has been appropriated by the few. After\r\npassing from off the tract of moor which overlies the granitic axis of\r\nthe district, to a tract equally moory which spreads over the gray\r\nflagstones, I marked, more especially in the hollows and ravines, where\r\nminute springs ooze from the rock, vast quantities of bog-iron embedded\r\nin the soil, and presenting greatly the appearance of the scoria of a\r\nsmith's forge. The apparent scoria here is simply a reproduction of the\r\niron of the underlying flagstones, transferred, through the agency of\r\nwater, to that stratum of vegetable mould and boulder-clay which\r\nrepresents the recent period.\r\n\r\nI found the stack which I had been brought to see forming the\r\npicturesque centre of a bold tract of rock scenery. It stands out from\r\nthe land as a tall insulated tower, about two hundred feet in height,\r\nsorely worn at its base by the breakers that ceaselessly fret against\r\nits sides, but considerably broader atop, where it bears a flat cover of\r\nsward on the same level with the tops of the precipices which in the\r\nlapse of ages have receded from around it. Like the sward-crested\r\nhammock left by a party of laborers, to mark the depth to which they\r\nhave cut in removing a bank or digging a pond, it remains to indicate\r\nhow the attrition of the surf has told upon the iron-bound coast;\r\ndemonstrating that lines of precipices hard as iron, and of giddy\r\nelevation, are in full retreat before the dogged perseverance of an\r\nassailant that, though baffled in each single attack, ever returns to\r\nthe charge, and gains by an aggregation of infinitesimals,--the result\r\nof the whole. From the edge of a steep promontory that commands an\r\ninflection of the coast, and of the wall of rock which sweeps round it,\r\nI watched for a few seconds the sea,--greatly heightened at the time by\r\nthe setting in of the flood-tide,--as it broke, surge after surge,\r\nagainst the base of the tall dark precipices; and marked how it\r\naccomplished its work of disintegration. The flagstone deposit here\r\nabounds in vertical cracks and flaws; and in the line of each of the\r\nmany fissures which these form the waves have opened up a cave; so that\r\nfor hundreds of yards together the precipices seem as if founded on\r\narch-divided piers, and remind one of those ancient prints or drawings\r\nof Old London Bridge in which a range of tall sombre buildings is\r\nrepresented as rising high over a line of arches; or of rows of lofty\r\nhouses in those cities of southern Europe in which the dwellings\r\nfronting the streets are perforated beneath by lines of squat piazzas,\r\nand present above a dingy and windowless breadth of wall. In course of\r\ntime the piers attenuate and give way; the undermined precipices topple\r\ndown, parting from the solid mass behind in those vertical lines by\r\nwhich they are traversed at nearly right angles with their line of\r\nstratification; the perpendicular front which they had covered comes to\r\nbe presented, in consequence, to the sea; its faults and cracks\r\ngradually widen into caves, as those of the fallen front had gradually\r\nwidened at an earlier period; in the lapse of centuries, it too,\r\nresigning its place, topples over headlong, an undermined mass; the\r\nsurge dashes white and furious where the dense rock had rested before;\r\nand thus, in its slow but irresistible march, the sea gains upon the\r\nland. In the peculiar disposition and character of the prevailing strata\r\nof Orkney, as certainly as in the power of the tides which sweep athwart\r\nits coasts, and the wide extent of sea which, stretching around it,\r\ngives the waves scope to gather bulk and momentum, may be found the\r\nsecret of the extraordinary height to which the surf sometimes rises\r\nagainst its walls of rock. During the fiercer tempests, masses of foam\r\nshoot upwards against the precipices, like inverted cataracts, fully two\r\nhundred feet over the ordinary tide-level, and, washing away the looser\r\nsoil from their summits, leaves in its place patches of slaty gravel,\r\nresembling that of a common sea-beach. Rocks less perpendicular,\r\nhowever great the violence of the wind and sea, would fail to project\r\nupwards bodies of surf to a height so extraordinary. But the low angle\r\nat which the strata lie, and the rectangularity maintained in relation\r\nto their line of bed by the fissures which traverse them, give to the\r\nOrkney precipices,--remarkable for their perpendicularity and their\r\nmural aspect,--exactly the angle against which the waves, as broken\r\nmasses of foam, beat up to their greatest possible altitude. On a tract\r\nof iron-bound coast that skirts the entrance of the Cromarty Frith I\r\nhave seen the surf rise, during violent gales from the north-west\r\nespecially, against one rectangular rock, known as the White Rock, fully\r\nan hundred feet; while against scarcely any of the other precipices,\r\nmore sloping, though equally exposed, did it rise more than half that\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     Detached Fossils--Remains of the Pterichthys--Terminal Bones of the\r\n     Coccosteus, etc., preserved--Internal Skeleton of Coccosteus--The\r\n     shipwrecked Sailor in the Cave--Bishop Grahame--His Character, as\r\n     drawn by Baillie--His Successor--Ruins of the Bishop's\r\n     Country-house--Sub-aerial Formation of Sandstone--Formation near\r\n     New Kaye--Inference from such Formation--Tour resumed--Loch of\r\n     Stennis--Waters of the Loch fresh, brackish, and salt--Vegetation\r\n     varied accordingly--Change produced in the Flounder by fresh\r\n     water--The Standing Stones, second only to Stonehenge--Their\r\n     purpose--Their Appearance and Situation--Diameter of the\r\n     Circle--What the Antiquaries say of it--Reference to it in the\r\n     \"Pirate\"--Dr. Hibbert's Account.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe returned to Stromness along the edge of the cliffs gradually\r\ndescending from higher to lower ranges of prepices, and ever and anon\r\ndetecting ichthyolite beds in the weathered and partially decomposed\r\nstrata. As the rock moulders into an incoherent clay, the fossils which\r\nit envelops become not unfrequently wholly detached from it, so that, on\r\na smart blow dealt by the hammer, they leap out entire, resembling, from\r\nthe degree of compression which they exhibit, those mimic fishes carved\r\nout of plates of ivory or of mother-of-pearl, which are used as counters\r\nin some of the games of China or the East Indies. The material of which\r\nthey are composed, a brittle jet, though better suited than the stone to\r\nresist the disintegrating influences, is in most cases greatly too\r\nfragile for preservation. One may, however, acquire from the fragments a\r\nknowledge of certain minute points in the structure of the ancient\r\nanimals to which they belonged, respecting which specimens of a more\r\nrobust texture give no evidence. The plates of Coccosteus sometimes\r\nspring out as unbroken as when they covered the living animal, and, if\r\nthe necessary skill be not wanting, may be set up in their original\r\norder. And I possess specimens of the head of Dipterus in which the\r\nnearly circular gill-covers may be examined on both surfaces, interior\r\nand exterior, and in which the cranial portion shows not only the\r\nenamelled plates of the frontal buckler, but also the strange mechanism\r\nof the palatal teeth, with the intervening cavities that had lodged both\r\nthe brain and the occipital part of the spine. The fossils on the top of\r\nthe cliffs here are chiefly Dipterians of the two closely allied genera,\r\nDiplopterus and Osteolepis.\r\n\r\nA little farther on, I found, on a hill-side in which extensive\r\nslate-quarries had once been wrought, the remains of Pterichthys\r\nexisting as mere patches, from which the color had been discharged, but\r\nin which the almost human-like outline of both body and arms were still\r\ndistinctly traceable; and farther on still, where the steep wall of\r\ncliffs sinks into a line of grassy banks, I saw in yet another quarry,\r\nichthyolites of all the three great ganoid families so characteristic of\r\nthe Old Red,--Cephalaspians, Dipterians, and Acanthodians,--ranged in\r\nthe three-storied order to which I have already referred as so\r\ninexplicable. The specimens, however, though numerous, are not fine.\r\nThey are resolved into a brittle bituminous coal, resembling hard pitch\r\nor black wax, which is always considerably less tenacious than the\r\nmatrix in which they are inclosed; and so, when laid open by the hammer,\r\nthey usually split through the middle of the plates and scales, instead\r\nof parting from the stone at their surfaces, and resemble, in\r\nconsequence, those dark, shadow-like profiles taken in Indian ink by the\r\nlimner, which exhibit a correct outline, but no details. We find,\r\nhowever, in some of the genera, portions of the animal preserved that\r\nare rarely seen in a state of keeping equally perfect in the\r\nichthyolites of Cromarty, Moray, or Banff,--those terminal bones of the\r\nCoccosteos, for instance, that were prolonged beyond the plates by which\r\nthe head and upper parts of the body were covered. Wherever the\r\nichthyolites are inclosed in nodules, as in the more southerly counties\r\nover which the deposit extends, the nodule terminates, in almost every\r\ncase, with the massier portions of the organism; for the thinner parts,\r\ntoo inconsiderable to have served as attractive nuclei to the stony\r\nmatter when the concretion was forming, were left outside its pale, and\r\nso have been lost; whereas, in the northern districts of the deposit,\r\nwhere the fossils, as in Caithness and Orkney, occur in flagstone, these\r\nslimmer parts, when the general state of keeping is tolerably good, lie\r\nspread out on the planes of the slabs, entire often in their minutest\r\nrays and articulations. The numerous Coccostei of this quarry exhibit,\r\nattached to their upper plates, their long vertebral columns, of many\r\njoints, that, depending from the broad dorsal shields of the\r\nichthyolite, remind one of those skeleton fishes one sometimes sees on\r\nthe shores of a fishing village, in which the bared backbone joints on,\r\ncord-like, to the broad plates of the skull. None of the other fishes of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone possessed an internal skeleton so decidedly\r\nosseous as that of the Coccosteus, and none of them presented externally\r\nso large an extent of naked skin,--provisions which probably went\r\ntogether. For about three-fifths of the entire length of the animal the\r\nsurface was unprotected by dermal plates; and the muscles must have\r\nfound the fulcrums on which they acted in the internal skeleton\r\nexclusively. And hence a necessity for greater strength in their\r\ninterior framework than in that of fishes as strongly fenced round\r\nexternally by scales or plates as the coleoptera by their elytrine, or\r\nthe crustacea by their shells. Even in the Coccosteus, however, the\r\nossification was by no means complete; and the analogies of the skeleton\r\nseem to have allied it rather with the skeletons of the sturgeon family\r\nthan with the skeletons of the sharks or rays. The processes of the\r\nvertebrae were greatly more solid in their substance than the vertebrae\r\nthemselves,--a condition which in the sharks and rays is always\r\nreversed; and they frequently survive, each with its little sprig of\r\nbone, formed like the letter Y, that attached it to its centrum,\r\nprojecting from it, in specimens from which the vertebral column itself\r\nhas wholly disappeared. I found frequent traces, during my exploratory\r\nlabors in Orkney, of the dorsal and ventral fins of this ichthyolite;\r\nbut no trace whatever of the pectorals or of the caudal fin. There seem\r\nto have been no pectorals; and the tail, as I have always had occasion\r\nto remark, was apparently a mere point, unfurnished with rays.\r\n\r\nIn descending from the cliffs upon the quarries, my companion pointed to\r\nan angular notch in the rock-edge, apparently the upper termination of\r\none of the numerous vertical cracks by which the precipices are\r\ntraversed, and which in so many cases on the Orkney coast have been\r\nhollowed by the waves into long open coves or deep caverns. It was up\r\nthere, he said, that about twelve years ago the sole survivor of a\r\nship's crew contrived to scramble, four days after his vessel had been\r\ndashed to fragments against the rocks below, and when it was judged that\r\nall on board had perished. The vessel was wrecked on a Wednesday. She\r\nhad been marked, when in the offing, standing for the bay of Stromness;\r\nbut the storm was violent, and the shore a lee one; and as it was seen\r\nfrom the beach that she could scarce weather the headland yonder, a\r\nnumber of people gathered along the cliffs, furnished with ropes, to\r\nrender to the crew whatever assistance might be possible in the\r\ncircumstances. Human help, however, was to avail them nothing. Their\r\nvessel, a fine schooner, when within forty yards of the promontory, was\r\nseized broadside by an enormous wave, and dashed against the cliff, as\r\none might dash a glass-phial against a stone-wall. One blow completed\r\nthe work of destruction; she went rolling in entire from keel to\r\nmast-head, and returned, on the recoil of the broken surge, a mass of\r\nshapeless fragments, that continued to dance idly amid the foam, or were\r\nscattered along the beach. But of the poor men, whom the spectators had\r\nseen but a few seconds before running wildly about the deck, there\r\nremained not a trace; and the saddened spectators returned to their\r\nhomes to say that all had perished. Four days after,--on the morning of\r\nthe following Sabbath,--the sole survivor of the crew, saved, as if by\r\nmiracle, climbed up the precipice, and presented himself to a group of\r\nastonished and terrified country people, who could scarce regard him as\r\na creature of this world. The fissure, which at the top of the cliff\r\nforms but a mere angular inflection, is hollowed below into a low-roofed\r\ncave of profound depth, into the farther extremity of which the tide\r\nhardly ever penetrates. It is floored by a narrow strip of shingly\r\nbeach; and on this bit of beach, far within the cave, the sailor found\r\nhimself, half a minute after the vessel had struck and gone to pieces,\r\nwashed in, he knew not how. Two pillows and a few dozen red herrings,\r\nwhich had been swept in along with him, served him for bed and board; a\r\ntin cover enabled him to catch enough of the fresh-water droppings of\r\nthe roof to quench his thirst; several large fragments of wreck that had\r\nbeen jammed fast athwart the opening of the cave broke the violence of\r\nthe wind and sea; and in that doleful prison, day after day, he saw the\r\ntides sink and rise, and lay, when the surf rolled high at the fall of\r\nthe tide, in utter darkness even at mid-day, as the waves outside rose\r\nto the roof, and inclosed him in a chamber as entirely cut off from the\r\nexternal atmosphere as that of a diving bell. He was oppressed in the\r\ndarkness, every time the waves came rolling in and compressed his\r\nmodicum of air, by a sensation of extreme heat,--an effect of the\r\ncondensation; and then, in the interval of recession, and consequent\r\nexpansion, by a sudden chill. At low ebb he had to work hard in clearing\r\naway the accumulations of stone and gravel which had been rolled in by\r\nthe previous tide, and threatened to bury him up altogether. At length\r\nhe succeeded, after many a fruitless attempt, in gaining an upper ledge\r\nthat overhung his prison-mouth; and, by a path on which a goat would\r\nscarce have found footing, he scrambled to the top. His name was\r\nJohnstone; and the cave is still known as \"Johnstone's Cave.\" Such was\r\nthe narrative of my companion.\r\n\r\nA little farther on, the undulating bank, into which the cliffs sink,\r\nprojects into the sea as a flat green promontory, edged with hills of\r\nindurated sand, and topped by a picturesque ruin, that forms a pleasing\r\nobject in the landscape. The ruin is that of a country residence of the\r\nbishops of Orkney during the disturbed and unhappy reign of Scotch\r\nEpiscopacy, and bears on a flat tablet of weathered sandstone the\r\ninitials of its founder, Bishop George Grahame, and the date of its\r\nerection, 1633. With a green cultivated oasis immediately around it, and\r\na fine open sound, overlooked by the bold, picturesque cliffs of Hoy, in\r\nfront, it must have been, for at least half the year, an agreeable, and,\r\nas its remains testify, a not uncomfortable habitation. But I greatly\r\nfear Scottish clergymen of the Establishment, whether Presbyterian or\r\nEpiscopalian, when obnoxious, from their position or their tenets, to\r\nthe great bulk of the Scottish people, have not been left, since at\r\nleast the Reformation, to enjoy either quiet or happy lives, however\r\nextrinsically favorable the circumstances in which they may have been\r\nplaced. Bishop Grahame, only five years after the date of the erection,\r\nwas tried before the famous General Assembly of 1638; and, being\r\nconvicted of having \"all the ordinar faults of a bishop,\" he was\r\ndeposed, and ordered within a limited time \"to give tokens of\r\nrepentance, under paine of excommunication.\" \"He was a curler on the ice\r\non the Sabbath day,\" says Baillie,--\"a setter of tacks to his sones and\r\ngrandsones, to the prejudice of the Church; he oversaw adulterie;\r\nslighted charming; neglected preaching and doing of anie good; and held\r\nportions of ministers' stipends for building his cathedral.\" The\r\nconcluding portion of his life, after his deposition, was spent in\r\nobscurity; nor did his successor in the bishoprick, subsequent to the\r\nreestablishment of Episcopacy at the Restoration,--Bishop\r\nHoneyman,--close his days more happily. He was struck in the arm by the\r\nbullet which the zealot Mitchell had intended for Archbishop Sharp; and\r\nthe shattered bone never healed; \"for, though he lived some years\r\nafter,\" says Burnet, \"_they_ were forced to lay open the wound every\r\nyear, for an exfoliation;\" and his life was eventually shortened by his\r\nsufferings. All seemed comfortable enough, and quite quiet enough, in\r\nthe bishop's country-house to-day. There were two cows quietly chewing\r\nthe cud in what apparently had been the dignitary's sitting-room, and\r\npatiently awaiting the services of a young woman who was approaching at\r\nsome little distance with a pail. A large gray cat, that had been\r\nsunning herself in a sheltered corner of the court-yard, started up at\r\nour approach, and disappeared through a slit hole. The sun, now gone far\r\ndown the sky, shone brightly on shattered gable-tops, and roofless,\r\nrough-edged walls, revealing many a flaw and chasm in the yielding\r\nmasonry; and their shadows fell with picturesque effect on the loose\r\nlitter, rude implements, and gapped dry-stone fence, of the neglected\r\nfarm-yard which surrounds the building.\r\n\r\nI have said that the flat promontory occupied by the ruin is edged by\r\nhills of indurated sand. Existing in some places as a continuous bed of\r\na soft gritty sandstone, scooped wave-like a-top, and varying from five\r\nto eight feet in thickness, they form a curious example of a sub-aerial\r\nformation,--the sand of which they are composed having been all blown\r\nfrom the sea-beach, and consolidated by the action of moisture on a\r\ncalcareous mixture of comminuted shells, which forms from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of their entire mass. I found that the sections of\r\nthe bed laid open by the encroachments of the sea, were scarce less\r\nregularly stratified than those of a subaqueous deposit, and that it was\r\nhollowed, where most exposed to the weather, into a number of spherical\r\ncells, which gave to those parts of the surface where they lay thickest,\r\nsomewhat the aspect of a rude Runic fret-work,--an appearance not\r\nuncommon in weathered sandstones. With more time to spare, I could fain\r\nhave studied the deposit more carefully, in the hope of detecting a few\r\npeculiarities of structure sufficient to distinguish sub-aerially-formed\r\nfrom subaqueously-deposited beds of stone. Sandstones of sub-aerial\r\nformation are of no very unfrequent occurrence among the recent\r\ndeposits. On the coast of Cornwall there are cliffs of considerable\r\nheight that extend for several miles, and have attained a degree of\r\nsolidity sufficient to serve the commoner purposes of the architect,\r\nwhich at one time existed as accumulations of blown sand. \"It is around\r\nthe promontory of New Kaye,\" says Dr. Paris, in an interesting memoir on\r\nthe subject, \"that the most extensive formation of sandstone takes\r\nplace. Here it may be seen in different stages of induration, from a\r\nstate in which it is too friable to be detached from the rock upon which\r\nit reposes, to a hardness so considerable, that it requires a violent\r\nblow from a sledge-hammer to break it. Buildings are here constructed of\r\nit; the church of Cranstock is entirely built with it; and it is also\r\nemployed for various articles of domestic and agricultural uses. The\r\ngeologist who has previously examined the celebrated specimen from\r\nGuadaloupe will be struck with the great analogy which it bears to this\r\nformation.\" Now, as vast tracts of the earth's surface,--in some parts\r\nof the world, as in Northern Africa, millions of square miles\r\ntogether,--are at present overlaid by accumulations of sand, which have\r\nthis tendency to consolidate and become lasting sub-aerial formations,\r\ndestined to occupy a place among the future strata of the globe, it\r\nseems impossible but that also in the old geologic periods there must\r\nhave been, as now, sand-wastes and sub-aerial formations. And as the\r\nrepresentatives of these may still exist in some of our sandstone\r\nquarries, it might be well to be possessed of a knowledge of the\r\npeculiarities by which they are to be distinguished from deposits of\r\nsubaqueous origin. In order that I might have an opportunity of studying\r\nthese peculiarities where they are to be seen more extensively developed\r\nthan elsewhere on the eastern coast of Scotland, I here formed the\r\nintention of spending a day, on my return south, among the sand-wastes\r\nof Moray,--a purpose which I afterwards carried into effect. But of that\r\nmore anon.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, availing myself of a kind invitation, through\r\nDr. Garson, from his brother, a Free Church minister resident in an\r\ninland district of the Mainland, in convenient neighborhood with the\r\nnorthern coasts of the island, and with several quarries, I set out\r\nfrom Stromness, taking in my way the Loch and Standing Stones of\r\nStennis, which I had previously seen from but my seat in the mail-gig as\r\nI passed. Mr. Learmonth, who had to visit some of his people in this\r\ndirection, accompanied me for several miles along the shores of the\r\nloch, and lightened the journey by his interesting snatches of local\r\nhistory, suggested by the various objects that lay along our\r\nroad,--buildings, tumuli, ancient battle-fields, and standing stones.\r\nThe loch itself, an expansive sheet of water fourteen miles in\r\ncircumference, I contemplated with much interest, and longed for an\r\nopportunity of studying its natural history. Two promontories,--those\r\noccupied by the Standing Stones, shoot out from the opposite sides, and\r\napproach so near as to be connected by a rustic bridge. They divide the\r\nloch into two nearly equal parts, the lower of which gives access to the\r\nsea, and is salt in its nether reaches and brackish in its upper ones,\r\nwhile the higher is merely brackish in its nether reaches, and fresh\r\nenough in its upper ones to be potable. The shores of both were strewed,\r\nat the time I passed, by a line of wrack, consisting, for the first few\r\nmiles, from where the lower loch opens to the sea, of only marine\r\nplants, then of marine plants mixed with those of fresh-water growth,\r\nand then, in the upper sheet of water, of lacustrine plants exclusively.\r\nAnd the fauna of the loch, like its flora, is, I was led to understand,\r\nof the same mixed character; the marine and fresh-water animals having\r\neach their own reaches, with certain debatable tracts between, in which\r\neach expatiates with more or less freedom, according to its nature and\r\nconstitution,--some of the sea-fishes advancing far on the fresh water,\r\nand others, among the proper denizens of the lake, encroaching far on\r\nthe salt. The common fresh-water eel strikes out, I was told, farthest\r\ninto the sea-water; in which, indeed, reversing the habits of the\r\nsalmon, it is known in various places to deposit its spawn; it seeks,\r\ntoo, impatient of a low temperature, to escape from the cold of winter,\r\nby taking refuge in water brackish enough in a climate such as ours to\r\nresist the influence of frost. Of the marine fishes; on the other hand,\r\nI found that the flounder got greatly higher than any of the others,\r\ninhabiting reaches of the lake almost entirely fresh. A memoir on the\r\nLoch of Stennis and its productions, animal and vegetable, such as a\r\nGilbert White of Selborne could produce, would be at once a very\r\nvaluable and very curious document. By dividing it into reaches, in\r\nwhich the average saltness of the water was carefully ascertained, and\r\nits productions noted, with the various modifications which these\r\nunderwent as they receded upwards or downwards from their proper habitat\r\ntowards the line at which they could no longer exist, much information\r\nmight be acquired, of a kind important to the naturalist, and not\r\nwithout its use to the geological student. I have had an opportunity\r\nelsewhere of observing a curious change which fresh-water induces on the\r\nflounder. In the brackish water of an estuary it becomes, without\r\ndiminishing in general size, thicker and more fleshy than when in its\r\nlegitimate habitat the sea; but the flesh loses in quality what it gains\r\nin quantity;--it is flabby and insipid, and the margin-fin lacks always\r\nits delicious strip of transparent fat. I fain wish that some\r\nintelligent resident on the shores of Stennis would set himself\r\ncarefully to examine its productions, and that then, after registering\r\nhis observations for a few years, he would favor the world with its\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\nThe Standing Stones,--second in Britain of their kind, to only those of\r\nStonehenge,--occur in two groups; the smaller group (composed, however,\r\nof the taller stones) on the southern promontory; the larger on the\r\nnorthern one. Rude and shapeless, and bearing no other impress of the\r\ndesigning faculty than that they are stuck endwise in the earth, and\r\nform, as a whole, regular figures on the sward, there is yet a sublime\r\nsolemnity about them, unsurpassed in effect by any ruin I have yet seen,\r\nhowever grand in its design or imposing in its proportions. Their very\r\nrudeness, associated with their ponderous bulk and weight, adds to their\r\nimpressiveness. When there is art and taste enough in a country to hew\r\nan ornate column, no one marvels that there should also be mechanical\r\nskill enough in it to set it up on end; but the men who tore from the\r\nquarry these vast slabs, some of them eighteen feet in height over the\r\nsoil, and raised them where they now stand, must have been ignorant\r\nsavages, unacquainted with machinery, and unfurnished, apparently, with\r\na single tool. And what, when contemplating their handiwork, we have to\r\nsubtract in idea from their minds, we add, by an involuntary process, to\r\ntheir bodies: we come to regard the feats which they have accomplished\r\nas performed by a power not mechanical, but gigantic. The consideration,\r\ntoo, that these remains,--eldest of the works of man in this\r\ncountry,--should have so long survived all definite tradition of the\r\npurposes which they were raised to serve, so that we now merely know\r\nregarding them that they were religious in their uses,--products of that\r\nineradicable instinct of man's nature which leads him in so many various\r\nways to attempt conciliating the Powers of another world,--serves\r\ngreatly to heighten their effect. History at the time of their erection\r\nhad no existence in these islands: the age, though it sought, through\r\nthe medium of strange, unknown rites, to communicate with Heaven, was\r\nnot knowing enough to communicate, through the medium of alphabet or\r\nsymbol, with posterity. The appearance of the obelisks, too, harmonizes\r\nwell with their great antiquity and the obscurity of their origin. For\r\nabout a man's height from the ground they are covered thick by the\r\nshorter lichens,--chiefly the gray-stone parmelia,--here and there\r\nembroidered by golden-hued patches of the yellow parmelia of the wall;\r\nbut their heads and shoulders, raised beyond the reach alike of the\r\nherd-boy and of his herd, are covered by an extraordinary profusion of a\r\nflowing beard-like lichen of unusual length,--the lichen _calicarus_\r\n(or, according to modern botanists, _Ramalina scopulorum_), in which\r\nthey look like an assemblage of ancient Druids, mysteriously stern and\r\ninvincibly silent and shaggy as the bard of Gray, when\r\n\r\n \"Loose his beard and hoary hair\r\n Streamed like a meteor on the troubled air.\"\r\n\r\nThe day was perhaps too sunny and clear for seeing the Standing Stones\r\nto the best possible advantage. They could not be better placed than on\r\ntheir flat promontories, surrounded by the broad plane of an extensive\r\nlake, in a waste, lonely, treeless country, that presents no bold,\r\ncompeting features to divert attention from them as the great central\r\nobjects of the landscape; but the gray of the morning, or an atmosphere\r\nof fog and vapor, would have associated better with the mystic obscurity\r\nof their history, their shaggy forms, and their livid tints, than the\r\nglare of a cloudless sun, that brought out in hard, clear relief their\r\nrude outlines, and gave to each its sharp dark patch of shadow.\r\nGray-colored objects, when tall and imposing, but of irregular form, are\r\nseen always to most advantage in an uncertain light,--in fog or\r\nfrost-rime, or under a scowling sky, or, as Parnell well expresses it,\r\n\"amid the living gleams of night.\" They appeal, if I may so express\r\nmyself, to the sentiment of the ghostly and the spectral, and demand at\r\nleast a partial envelopment of the obscure. Burns, with the true tact of\r\nthe genuine poet, develops the sentiment almost instinctively in an\r\nexquisite stanza in one of his less-known songs, \"The Posey,\"--\r\n\r\n \"The hawthorn I will pu', _wi' its locks o' siller gray_,\r\n Where, _like an aged man, it stands at break o' day_.\"\r\n\r\nScott, too, in describing these very stones, chooses the early morning\r\nas the time in which to exhibit them, when they \"stood in the gray light\r\nof the dawning, like the phantom forms of antediluvian giants, who,\r\nshrouded in the habiliments of the dead, come to revisit, by the pale\r\nlight, the earth which they had plagued with their oppression, and\r\npolluted by their sins, till they brought down upon it the vengeance of\r\nlong-suffering heaven.\" On another occasion, he introduces them as\r\n\"glimmering, a grayish white, in the rising sun, and projecting far to\r\nthe westward their long gigantic shadows.\" And Malcolm, in the exercise\r\nof a similar faculty with that of Burns and of Scott, surrounds them, in\r\nhis description, with a somewhat similar atmosphere of partial dimness\r\nand obscurity:--\r\n\r\n \"The hoary rocks, of giant size,\r\n That o'er the land in circles rise,\r\n Of which tradition may not tell,\r\n Fit circles for the wizard's spell,\r\n Seen far _amidst the scowling storm_,\r\n Seem each a tall and phantom form,\r\n _As hurrying vapors o'er them flee,_\r\n Frowning in grim security,\r\n While, like a dread voice from the past,\r\n Around them moans the autumnal blast.\"\r\n\r\nThere exist curious analogies between the earlier stages of society and\r\nthe more immature periods of life,--between the savage and the child;\r\nand the huge circle of Stennis seems suggestive of one of these. It is\r\nconsiderably more than four hundred feet in diameter, and the stones\r\nwhich compose it, varying from three to fourteen feet in height, must\r\nhave been originally from thirty-five to forty in number, though only\r\nsixteen now remain erect. A mound and fosse, still distinctly\r\ntraceable, run round the whole; and there are several mysterious-looking\r\ntumuli outside, bulky enough to remind one of the lesser morains of the\r\ngeologist. But the circle, notwithstanding its imposing magnitude, is\r\nbut a huge child's house, after all,--one of those circles of stones\r\nwhich children lay down on their village green, and then, in the\r\nexercise of that imaginative faculty which distinguishes between the\r\nyoung of the human animal and those of every other creature, convert, by\r\na sort of conventionalism, into a church or dwelling-house, within which\r\nthey seat themselves, and enact their imitations of their seniors,\r\nwhether domestic or ecclesiastical. The circle of Stennis was a circle,\r\nsay the antiquaries, devoted to the sun. The group of stones on the\r\nsouthern promontory of the lake formed but a half-circle, and it was a\r\nhalf-circle dedicated to the moon. To the circular sun the great rude\r\nchildren of an immature age of the world had laid down a circle of\r\nstones on the one promontory; to the moon, in her half-orbed state, they\r\nhad laid down a half-circle on the other; and in propitiating these\r\nmaterial deities, to whose standing in the old Scandinavian worship the\r\nnames of our _Sun_day and _Mon_day still testify, they employed in their\r\nrespective inclosures, in the exercise of a wild unregulated fancy,\r\nuncouth irrational rites, the extremeness of whose folly was in some\r\nmeasure concealed by the horrid exquisiteness of their cruelty. We are\r\nstill in the nonage of the species, and see human society sowing its\r\nwild oats in a thousand various ways, very absurdly often, and often\r\nvery wickedly; but matters seem to have been greatly worse when, in an\r\nage still more immature, the grimly-bearded, six-feet children of Orkney\r\nwere laying down their stone-circles on the green. Sir Walter, in the\r\nparting scene between Cleveland and Minna Troil, which he describes as\r\nhaving taken place amid the lesser group of stones, refers to an immense\r\nslab \"lying flat and prostrate in the middle of the others, supported\r\nby short pillars, of which some relics are still visible,\" and which is\r\nregarded as the sacrificial stone of the erection. \"It is a current\r\nbelief,\" says Dr. Hibbert, in an elaborate paper in the \"Transactions of\r\nthe Scottish Antiquaries,\" that upon this stone a victim of royal birth\r\nwas immolated. Halfdan the Long-legged, the son of Harold the\r\nFair-haired, in punishment for the aggressions of Orkney, had made an\r\nunexpected descent upon its coasts, and acquired possession of the\r\nJarldom. In the autumn succeeding Halfdan was retorted upon, and, after\r\nan inglorious contest, betook himself to a place of concealment, from\r\nwhich he was the following morning unlodged, and instantly doomed to the\r\nAsae. Einar, the Jarl of Orkney, with his sword carved the captive's back\r\ninto the form of an eagle, the spine being longitudinally divided, and\r\nthe ribs being separated by a transverse cut as far as the loins. He\r\nthen extracted the lungs, and dedicated them to Odin for a perpetuity of\r\nvictory, singing a wild song,--'I am revenged for the slaughter of\r\nRognvalld: this have the Nornae decreed. In my fiording the pillar of the\r\npeople has fallen. Build up the cairn, ye active youths, for victory is\r\nwith us. From the stones of the sea-shore will I pay the Long-legged a\r\nhard seat.' There is certainly no trace to be detected, in this dark\r\nstory, of a golden age of the world: the golden age is, I would fain\r\nhope, an age yet to come. There at least exists no evidence that it is\r\nan age gone by. It will be the full-grown _manly_ age of the world when\r\nthe race, as such, shall have attained to their years of discretion.\r\nThey are at present in their froward boyhood, playing at the mischievous\r\ngames of war, and diplomacy, and stock-gambling, and site-refusing, and\r\nit is not quite agreeable for quiet honest people to be living amongst\r\nthem. But there would be nothing gained by going back to that more\r\ninfantine state of society in which the Jarl Einar carved into a red\r\neagle the back of Halfdan the Long-legged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     On Horseback--A pared Moor--Small Landholders--Absorption of small\r\n     holdings in England and Scotland--Division of Land favorable to\r\n     Civil and Religious Rights--Favorable to social Elevation--An\r\n     inland Parish--The Landsman and Lobster--Wild Flowers of\r\n     Orkney--Law of Compensation illustrated by the Tobacco\r\n     Plant--Poverty tends to Productiveness--Illustrated in\r\n     Ireland--Profusion of Ichthyolites--Orkney a land of Defunct\r\n     Fishes--Sandwick--A Collection of Coccostean Flags--A Quarry full\r\n     of Heads of Dipteri--The Bergil, or Striped Wrasse--Its Resemblance\r\n     to the Dipterus--Poverty of the Flora of the Lower Old Red--No true\r\n     Coniferous Wood in the Orkney Flagstones--Departure for Hoy--The\r\n     intelligent Boatman--Story of the Orkney Fisherman.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile yet lingering amid the Standing Stones, I was joined by Mr.\r\nGarson, who had obligingly ridden a good many miles to meet me, and now\r\ninsisted that I should mount and ride in turn, while he walked by my\r\nside, that I might be fresh, he said, for the exploratory ramble of the\r\nevening. I could have ventured more readily on taking the command of a\r\nvessel than of a horse, and with fewer fears of mutiny; but mount I did;\r\nand the horse, a discreet animal, finding he was to have matters very\r\nmuch his own way, got upon honor with me, and exerted himself to such\r\npurpose that we did not fall greatly more than a hundred yards behind\r\nMr. Garson. We traversed in our journey a long dreary moor, so entirely\r\nruined, like those which I had seen on the previous day, by belonging to\r\neverybody in general, as to be no longer of the slightest use to anybody\r\nin particular. The soil seems to have been naturally poor; but it must\r\nhave taken a good deal of spoiling to render it the sterile, verdureless\r\nwaste it is now; for even where it had been poorest, I found that in the\r\nisland-like appropriated patches by which it is studded, it at least\r\nbears, what it has long ceased to bear elsewhere, a continuous covering\r\nof green sward. But if disposed to quarrel with the commons of Orkney, I\r\nfound in close neighborhood with them that with which I could have no\r\nquarrel,--numerous small properties farmed by the proprietors, and\r\nforming, in most instances, farms by no means very large. There are\r\nparishes in this part of the mainland divided among from sixty to eighty\r\nlandowners.\r\n\r\nA nearly similar state of things seems to have obtained in Scotland\r\nabout the beginning of the eighteenth century, and for the greater part\r\nof the previous one. I am acquainted with old churchyards in the north\r\nof Scotland that contain the burying-grounds of from six to ten landed\r\nproprietors, whose lands are now merged into single properties. And, in\r\nreading the biographies of our old covenanting ministers, I have often\r\nremarked as curious, and as bearing in the same line, that no\r\ninconsiderable proportion of their number were able to retire, in times\r\nof persecution, to their own little estates. It was during the\r\ndisastrous wars of the French Revolution,--wars from the effects of\r\nwhich Great Britain will, I fear, never fully recover,--that the smaller\r\nholdings were finally absorbed. About twenty years ere the war began,\r\nthe lands of England were parcelled out among no fewer than two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand families; before the peace of 1815, they had fallen\r\ninto the hands of thirty-two thousand. In less than half a century, that\r\nbase of actual proprietorship on which the landed interest of any\r\ncountry must ever find its surest standing, had contracted in England to\r\nless than one-seventh its former extent. In Scotland the absorption of\r\nthe great bulk of the lesser properties seems to have taken place\r\nsomewhat earlier; but in it also the revolutionary war appears to have\r\ngiven them the final blow; and the more extensive proprietors of the\r\nkingdom are assuredly all the less secure in consequence of their\r\nextinction. They were the smaller stones in the wall, that gave firmness\r\nin the setting to the larger, and jammed them fast within those safe\r\nlimits determined by the line and plummet, which it is ever perilous to\r\noverhang. Very extensive territorial properties, wherever they exist,\r\ncreate almost necessarily--human nature being what it is--a species of\r\ndespotism more oppressive than even that of great unrepresentative\r\ngovernments. It used to be remarked on the Continent, that there was\r\nalways less liberty in petty principalities, where the eye of the ruler\r\nwas ever on his subjects, than under the absolute monarchies.[23] And in\r\na country such as ours, the accumulation of landed property in the hands\r\nof comparatively a few individuals has the effect often of bringing the\r\nterritorial privileges of the great landowner into a state of\r\nantagonism with the civil and religious rights of the people, that\r\ncannot be other than perilous to the landowner himself. In a district\r\ndivided, like Orkney, among many owners, a whole country-side could not\r\nbe shut up against its people by some ungenerous or intolerant\r\nproprietor,--greatly at his own risk and to his own hurt,--as in the\r\ncase of Glen Tilt or the Grampians; nor, when met for purposes of public\r\nworship, could the population of a parish be chased from off its bare\r\nmoors, at his instance, by the constable or the sheriff-officer, to\r\nworship God agreeably to their consciences amid the mire of a\r\ncross-road, or on the bare sea-beach uncovered by the ebb of the tide.\r\nThe smaller properties of the country, too, served admirably as\r\nstepping-stones, by which the proprietors or their children, when\r\npossessed of energy and intellect, could mount to a higher walk of\r\nsociety. Here beside me, for instance, was my friend Mr. Garson, a\r\nuseful and much-esteemed minister of religion in his native district;\r\nwhile his brother, a medical man of superior parts, was fast rising into\r\nextensive practice in the neighboring town. They had been prepared for\r\ntheir respective professions by a classical education; and yet the\r\nstepping-stone to positions in society at once so important and so\r\nrespectable was simply one of the smaller holdings of Orkney, derived to\r\nthem as the descendants of one of the old Scandinavian Udallers, and\r\nwhich fell short, I was informed, of a hundred a-year.\r\n\r\nMr. Garson's dwelling, to which I was welcomed with much hospitality by\r\nhis mother and sisters, occupies the middle of an inclined hollow or\r\nbasin, so entirely surrounded by low, moory hills, that at no\r\npoint,--though the radius of the prospect averages from four to six\r\nmiles,--does it command a view of the sea. I scarce expected being\r\nintroduced in Orkney to a scene in which the traveller could so\r\nthoroughly forget that he was on an island. Of the parish of Harray,\r\nwhich borders on Mr. Garson's property, no part touches the sea-coast;\r\nand the people of the parish are represented by their neighbors, who\r\npride themselves upon their skill as sailors and boatmen, as a race of\r\nlubberly landsmen, unacquainted with nautical matters, and ignorant of\r\nthe ocean and its productions. A Harray man is represented, in one of\r\ntheir stories, as entering into a compact of mutual forbearance with a\r\nlobster,--to him a monster of unknown powers and formidable\r\nproportions,--which he had at first attempted to capture, but which had\r\nshown fight, and had nearly captured him in turn. \"Weel, weel, let a-be\r\nfor let a-be,\" he is made to say; \"if thou does na clutch me in thy\r\ngrips, I'se no clutch thee in mine.\" It is to this primitive parish that\r\nDavid Vedder, the sailor-poet of Orkney, refers, in his \"Orcadian\r\nSketches,\" as \"celebrated over the whole archipelago for the\r\npeculiarities of its inhabitants, their singular manners and habits,\r\ntheir uncouth appearance, and homely address. Being the most landward\r\ndistrict in Pomona,\" he adds, \"and consequently having little\r\nintercourse with strangers, it has become the stronghold of many ancient\r\ncustoms and superstitions, which modern innovation has pushed off from\r\ntheir pedestals in almost all the other parts of the island. The\r\npermanency of its population, too, is mightily in favor of 'old use and\r\nwont,' as it is almost entirely divided amongst a class of men yelept\r\n_pickie_, or petty lairds, each ploughing his own fields and reaping his\r\nown crops, much in the manner their great-great-grandfathers did in the\r\ndays of Earl Patrick. And such is the respect which they entertain for\r\ntheir hereditary beliefs, that many of them are said still to cast a\r\nlingering look, not unmixed with reverence, on certain spots held sacred\r\nby their Scandinavian ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an early dinner I set out for the barony of Birsay, in the\r\nnorthern extremity of the mainland, accompanied by Mr. Garson, and\r\npassed for several miles over a somewhat dreary country, bare, sterile,\r\nand brown, studded by cold, broad, treeless lakes, and thinly mottled by\r\ngroups of gray, diminutive cottages, that do not look as if there was\r\nmuch of either plenty or comfort inside. But after surmounting the hills\r\nthat form the northern side of the interior basin, I was sensible of a\r\nsudden improvement on the face of the country. Where the land slopes\r\ntowards the sea, the shaggy heath gives place to a green luxuriant\r\nherbage; and the frequent patches of corn seem to rejoice in a more\r\ngenial soil. The lower slopes of Orkney are singularly rich in wild\r\nflowers,--richer by many degrees than the fat loamy meadows of England.\r\nThey resemble gaudy pieces of carpeting, as abundant in petals as in\r\nleaves: their luxuriant blow of red and white, blue and yellow, seems as\r\nif competing, in the extent of surface which it occupies, with their\r\ngeneral ground of green. I have remarked a somewhat similar luxuriance\r\nof wild flowers in the more sheltered hollows of the bleak north-western\r\ncoasts of Scotland. There is little that is rare to be found among these\r\nlast, save that a few Alpine plants may be here and there recognized as\r\noccurring at a lower level than elsewhere in Britain; but the vast\r\nprofusion of blossoms borne by species common to the greater part of the\r\nkingdom imparts to them an apparently novel character. We may detect, I\r\nam inclined to think, in this singular profusion, both in Orkney and the\r\nbleaker districts of the mainland of Scotland, the operation of a law\r\nnot less influential in the animal than in the vegetable world, which,\r\nwhen hardship presses upon the life of the individual shrub or\r\nquadruped, so as to threaten its vitality, renders it fruitful in behalf\r\nof its species. I have seen the principle strikingly exemplified in the\r\ncommon tobacco plant, when reared in a northern country in the open air.\r\nYear after year it continued to degenerate, and to exhibit a smaller\r\nleaf and a shorter stem, until the successors of what in the first year\r\nof trial had been vigorous plants of from three to four feet in height,\r\nhad in the sixth or eighth become mere weeds of scarce as many inches.\r\nBut while the more flourishing, and as yet undegenerate plant, had\r\nmerely borne a-top a few florets, which produced a small quantity of\r\nexceedingly minute seeds, the stunted weed, its descendant, was so\r\nthickly covered over in its season with its pale yellow bells, as to\r\npresent the appearance of a nosegay; and the seeds produced were not\r\nonly bulkier in the mass, but also individually of much greater size.\r\nThe tobacco had grown productive in proportion as it had degenerated and\r\nbecome poor. In the common scurvy grass, too, remarkable, with some\r\nother plants, as I have already had occasion to mention, for taking its\r\nplace among both the productions of our Alpine heights and of our\r\nsea-shores, it will be found that in proportion as its habitat proves\r\nungenial, and its stems and leaves become dwarfish and thin, its little\r\nwhite cruciform flowers increase, till, in localities where it barely\r\nexists, as if on the edge of extinction, we find the entire plant\r\nforming a dense bundle of seed-vessels, each charged to the full with\r\nseed. And in the gay meadows of Orkney, crowded with a vegetation that\r\napproaches its northern limit of production, we detect what seems to be\r\nthe same principle, chronically operative; and hence, it would seem,\r\ntheir extraordinary gaiety. Their richly-blossoming plants are the poor\r\nproductive _Irish_ of the vegetable world;[24] for Doubleday seems to\r\nbe quite in the right in holding that the law extends to not only the\r\ninferior animals, but to our own species also. The lean, ill-fed sow and\r\nrabbit rear, it has been long known, a greatly more numerous progeny\r\nthan the same animals when well cared for and fat; and every horse and\r\ncattle breeder knows, that to over-feed his animals proves a sure mode\r\nof rendering them sterile. The sheep, if tolerably well pastured,\r\nbrings forth only a single lamb at a birth; but if half-starved and\r\nlean, the chances are that it may bring forth two or three. And so it is\r\nalso with the greatly higher human race. Place them in circumstances of\r\ndegradation and hardship so extreme as almost to threaten their\r\nexistence as individuals, and they increase, as if in behalf of the\r\nspecies, with a rapidity without precedent in circumstances of greater\r\ncomfort. The aristocratic families of a country are continually running\r\nout; and it requires frequent creations to keep up the House of Lords;\r\nwhile our poor people seem increasing in some districts in almost the\r\nmathematical ratio. The county of Sutherland is already more populous\r\nthan it was previous to the great clearings. In Skye, though fully\r\ntwo-thirds of the population emigrated early in the latter half of the\r\nlast century, a single generation had scarce passed ere the gap was\r\ncompletely filled; and miserable Ireland, had the human family no other\r\nbreeding-place or nursery, would of itself be sufficient in a very few\r\nages to people the world.\r\n\r\nWe returned, taking in our way the cliffs of Marwick Head, in which I\r\ndetected a few scattered plates and scales, and which, like nine-tenths\r\nof the rocks of Orkney, belong to the great flagstone division of the\r\nformation. I found the dry-stone fences on Mr. Garson's property still\r\nricher in detached fossil fragments than the cliffs; but there are few\r\nerections in the island that do not inclose in their walls portions of\r\nthe organic. We find ichthyolite remains in the flagstones laid bare\r\nalong the way-side,--in every heap of road-metal,--in the bottom of\r\nevery stream,--in almost every cottage and fence. Orkney is a land of\r\ndefunct fishes, and contains in its rocky folds more individuals of the\r\nwaning ganoid family than are now to be found in all the existing seas,\r\nlakes, and rivers of the world. I enjoyed in a snug upper room a\r\ndelectable night's rest, after a day of prime exercise, prolonged till\r\nit just touched on toil, and again experienced, on looking out in the\r\nmorning on the wide flat basin around, a feeling somewhat akin to\r\nwonder, that Orkney should possess a scene at once so extensive and so\r\nexclusively inland.\r\n\r\nTowards mid-day I walked on to the parish manse of Sandwick, armed with\r\na letter of introduction to its inmate, the Rev. Charles Clouston,--a\r\ngentleman whose descriptions of the Orkneys, in the very complete and\r\ntastefully written Guide-Book of the Messrs. Anderson of Inverness, and\r\nof his own parish in the \"Statistical Account of Scotland,\" had, both\r\nfrom the high literary ability and the amount of scientific acquirement\r\nwhich they exhibit, rendered me desirous to see. I was politely\r\nreceived, though my visit must have been, as I afterwards ascertained,\r\nat a rather inconvenient time. It was now late in the week, and the\r\ncoming Sabbath was that of the communion in the parish; but Mr. Clouston\r\nobligingly devoted to me at least an hour, and I found it a very\r\nprofitable one. He showed me a collection of flags, with which he\r\nintended constructing a grotto, and which contained numerous specimens\r\nof Coccosteus, that he had exposed to the weather, to bring out the fine\r\nblue efflorescence,--a phosphate of iron which forms on the surface of\r\nthe plates. They reminded me, from their peculiar style of coloring, and\r\nthe grotesqueness of their forms, of the blue figuring on pieces of\r\nbuff-colored china, and seemed to be chiefly of one species, very\r\nabundant in Orkney, the _Coccosteus decipiens_. We next walked out to\r\nsee a quarry in the neighborhood of the manse, remarkable for containing\r\nin immense abundance the heads of Dipteri,--many of them in a good state\r\nof keeping, with all the multitudinous plates to which they owe their\r\npseudo-name, Polyphractus, in their original places, and bearing unworn\r\nand untarnished their minute carvings and delicate enamel, but existing\r\nin every case as mere detached heads. I found three of them lying in one\r\nlittle slaty fragment of two and a half inches by four, which I brought\r\nalong with me. Mr. Clouston had never seen the curious arrangement of\r\npalatal plates and teeth which distinguishes the Dipterus; and, drawing\r\nhis attention to it in an ill-preserved specimen which I found in the\r\ncoping of his glebe-wall, I restored, in a rude pencil sketch, the two\r\nangular patches of teeth that radiate from the elegant dart-head in the\r\ncentre of the palate, with the rhomboidal plate behind. \"We have a fish,\r\nnot uncommon on the rocky coasts of this part of the country,\" he\r\nsaid,--\"the Bergil or Striped Wrasse (_Labras Balanus_),--which bears\r\nexactly such patches of angular teeth in its palate. They adhere\r\nstrongly together; and, when found in our old Picts' houses, which\r\noccasionally happens, they have been regarded by some of our local\r\nantiquaries as artificial,--an opinion which I have had to correct,\r\nthough it seems not improbable that, from their gem-like appearance,\r\nthey may have been used in a rude age as ornaments. I think I can show\r\nyou one disinterred here some years ago.\" It interested me to find, from\r\nMr. Clouston's specimens that the palatal grinders of this recent fish\r\nof Orkney very nearly resemble those of its _Dipterus_ of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. The group is of nearly the same size in the modern as in the\r\nancient fish, and presents the same angular form; but the individual\r\nteeth are more strongly set in the Bergil than in the Dipterus, and\r\nradiate less regularly from the inner rectangular point of the angle to\r\nits base outside. I could fain have procured an Orkney Bergil, in order\r\nto determine the general pattern of its palatal dentition with what is\r\nvery peculiar in the more ancient fish,--the form of the lower jaw; and\r\nto ascertain farther, from the contents of the stomach, the species of\r\nshell-fish or crustaceans on which it feeds; but, though by no means\r\nrare in Orkney, where it is occasionally used as food, I was unable,\r\nduring my short stay, to possess myself of a specimen.\r\n\r\nMr. Clouston had, I found, chiefly directed his palaeontological\r\ninquiries on the vegetable remains of the flagstones, as the department\r\nof the science in which, in relation to Orkney, most remained to be\r\ndone; and his collection of these is the most considerable in the number\r\nof its specimens that I have yet seen. It, however, serves but to show\r\nhow very extreme is the poverty of the flora of the Lower Old Red\r\nSandstone. The numerous fishes of the period seem to have inhabited a\r\nsea little more various in its vegetation than in its molluscs. Among\r\nthe specimens of Mr. Clouston's collection I could detect but two\r\nspecies of plants,--an imperfectly preserved vegetable, more nearly\r\nresembling a club-moss than aught I have seen, and a smooth-stemmed\r\nfucoid, existing as a mere coaly film on the stone, and distinguished\r\nchiefly from the other by its sharp-edged, well-defined outline, and\r\nfrom the circumstance that its stems continue to retain the same\r\ndiameter for a considerable distance, and this, too, after throwing off\r\nat acute angles numerous branches, nearly equal in bulk to the parent\r\ntrunk. In a specimen about two and a half feet in length, which I owe to\r\nthe kindness of Mr. Dick of Thurso, there are stems continuous\r\nthroughout, that, though they ramify into from six to eight branches in\r\nthat space, are quite as thick atop as at bottom. They are the remains,\r\nin all probability, of a long flexible fucoid, like those fucoids of the\r\nintertropical seas that, streaming slantwise in the tide, rise not\r\nunfrequently to the surface in fifteen and twenty fathoms water. I saw\r\namong Mr. Clouston's specimens no such lignite as the fragment of true\r\nconiferous wood which I had found at Cromarty a few years previous, and\r\nwhich, it would seem, is still unique among the fossils of the Old Red\r\nSandstone. In the chart of the Pacific attached to the better editions\r\nof \"Cook's Voyages,\" there are several entries along the track of the\r\ngreat navigator that indicate where, in mid-ocean, trees, or fragments\r\nof trees, had been picked up. The entries, however, are but few, though\r\nthey belong to all the three voyages together: if I remember aright,\r\nthere are only five entries in all,--two in the Northern and three in\r\nthe Southern Pacific. The floating tree, at a great distance from land,\r\nis of rare occurrence in even the present scene of things, though the\r\nbreadth of land be great, and trees numerous; and in the times of the\r\nOld Red Sandstone, when probably the breadth of land was _not_ great,\r\nand trees _not_ numerous, it seems to have been of rarer occurrence\r\nstill. But it is at least something to know that in this early age of\r\nthe world trees there were.\r\n\r\nI walked on to Stromness, and on the following morning, that of\r\nSaturday, took boat for Hoy,--skirting, on my passage out, the eastern\r\nand southern shores of the intervening island of Graemsay, and, on the\r\npassage back again, its western and northern shores. The boatman, an\r\nintelligent man,--one of the teachers, as I afterwards ascertained, in\r\nthe Free Church Sabbath-school,--lightened the way by his narratives of\r\nstorm and wreck, and not a few interesting snatches of natural history.\r\nThere is no member of the commoner professions with whom I better like\r\nto meet than with a sensible fisherman, who makes a right use of his\r\neyes. The history of fishes is still very much what the history of\r\nalmost all animals was little more than half a century ago,--a matter of\r\nmere external description, heavy often and dry, and of classification\r\nfounded exclusively on anatomical details. We have still a very great\r\ndeal to learn regarding the character, habits and instincts of these\r\ndenizens of the deep,--much, in short, respecting that faculty which is\r\nin them through which their natures are harmonized to the inexorable\r\nlaws, and they continue to live wisely and securely, in consequence,\r\nwithin their own element, when man, with all his reasoning ability, is\r\nplaying strange vagaries in his;--a species of knowledge this, by the\r\nway, which constitutes by far the most valuable part,--the _mental_\r\ndepartment of natural history; and the notes of the intelligent\r\nfisherman, gleaned from actual observation, have frequently enabled me\r\nto fill portions of the wide hiatus in the history of fishes which it\r\nought of right to occupy. In passing, as we toiled along the Graemsay\r\ncoast, the ruins of a solitary cottage, the boatman furnished us with a\r\nfew details of the history and character of its last inmate, an Orkney\r\nfisherman, that would have furnished admirable materials for one of the\r\ndarker sketches of Crabbe. He was, he said, a resolute, unsocial man,\r\nnot devoid of a dash of reckless humor, and remarkable for an\r\nextraordinary degree of bodily strength, which he continued to retain\r\nunbroken to an age considerably advanced, and which, as he rarely\r\nadmitted of a companion in his voyages, enabled him to work his little\r\nskiff alone, in weather when even better equipped vessels had enough ado\r\nto keep the sea. He had been married in early life to a\r\nreligiously-disposed woman, a member of some dissenting body; but,\r\nliving with him in the little island of Graemsay, separated by the sea\r\nfrom any place of worship, he rarely permitted her to see the inside of\r\na church. At one time, on the occasion of a communion Sabbath in the\r\nneighboring parish of Stromness, he seemed to yield to her entreaties,\r\nand got ready his yawl, apparently with the design of bringing her\r\nacross the Sound to the town. They had, however, no sooner quitted the\r\nshore than he sailed off to a green little Ogygia of a holm in the\r\nneighborhood, on which, reversing the old mythologic story of Calypso\r\nand Ulysses, he incarcerated the poor woman for the rest of the day till\r\nevening. I could see, from the broad grin with which the boatman greeted\r\nthis part of the recital, that there was, unluckily, almost fun enough\r\nin the trick to neutralize the sense of its barbarity. The unsocial\r\nfisherman lived on, dreaded and disliked, and yet, when his skiff was\r\nseen boldly keeping the sea in the face of a freshening gale, when every\r\nother was making for port, or stretching out from the land as some\r\nstormy evening was falling, not a little admired also. At length, on a\r\nnight of fearful tempest, the skiff was marked approaching the coast,\r\nfull on an iron-bound promontory, where there could be no safe landing.\r\nThe helm, from the steadiness of her course, seemed fast lashed, and,\r\ndimly discernible in the uncertain light, the solitary boatman could be\r\nseen sitting erect at the bows, as if looking out for the shore. But as\r\nhis little bark came shooting inwards on the long roll of a wave, it was\r\nfound that there was no speculation in his stony glance: the\r\nmisanthropic fisherman was a cold and rigid corpse. He had died at sea,\r\nas English juries emphatically express themselves in such cases, under\r\n\"the visitation of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n     Hoy--Unique Scenery--The Dwarfie Stone of Hoy--Sir Walter Scott's\r\n     Account of it--Its Associations--Inscription of Names--George\r\n     Buchanan's Consolation--The mythic Carbuncle of the Hill of Hoy--No\r\n     Fossils at Hoy--Striking Profile of Sir Walter Scott on the Hill of\r\n     Hoy--Sir Walter, and Shetland and Orkney--Originals of two\r\n     Characters in \"The Pirate\"--Bessie Millie--Garden of Gow, the\r\n     \"Pirate\"--Childhood's Scene of Byron's \"Torquil\"--The Author's\r\n     Introduction to his Sister--A German Visitor--German and Scotch\r\n     Sabbath-keeping habits contrasted--Mr. Watt's Specimens of Fossil\r\n     Remains--The only new Organism found in Orkney--Back to\r\n     Kirkwall--to Wick--Vedder's Ode to Orkney.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe landed at Hoy, on a rocky stretch of shore, composed of the gray\r\nflagstones of the district. They spread out here in front of the tall\r\nhills composed of the overlying sandstone, in a green undulating\r\nplatform, resembling a somewhat uneven esplanade spread out in front of\r\na steep rampart. With the upper deposit a new style of scenery\r\ncommences, unique in these islands: the hills, bold and abrupt, rise\r\nfrom fourteen to sixteen hundred feet over the sea-level; and the\r\nvalleys by which they are traversed,--no mere shallow inflections of the\r\ngeneral surface, like most of the other valleys of Orkney,--are of\r\nprofound depth, precipitous, imposing, and solitary. The sudden change\r\nfrom the soft, low, and comparatively tame, to the bold, stern, and\r\nhigh, serves admirably to show how much the character of a landscape may\r\ndepend on the formation which composes it. A walk of somewhat less than\r\ntwo miles brought me into the depths of a brown, shaggy valley, so\r\nprofoundly solitary, that it does not contain a single human habitation,\r\nnor, with one interesting exception, a single trace of the hand of man.\r\nAs the traveller approaches by a path somewhat elevated, in order to\r\navoid the peaty bogs of the bottom, along the slopes of the northern\r\nside of the dell, he sees, amid the heath below, what at first seems to\r\nbe a rhomboidal piece of pavement of pale Old Red Sandstone, bearing\r\natop a few stunted tufts of vegetation. There are no neighboring objects\r\nof a known character by which to estimate its size; the precipitous\r\nhill-front behind is more than a thousand feet in height: the greatly\r\ntaller Ward Hill of Hoy, which frowns over it on the opposite side, is\r\nat least five hundred feet higher; and, dwarfed by these giants, it\r\nseems a mere pavior's flag, mayhap some five or six feet square, by from\r\neighteen inches to two feet in depth. It is only on approaching it\r\nwithin a few yards that we find it to be an enormous stone, nearly\r\nthirty feet in length by almost fifteen feet in breadth, and in some\r\nplaces, though it thins, wedge-like, towards one of the edges, more than\r\nsix feet in thickness,--forming altogether such a mass as the quarrier\r\nwould detach from the solid rock to form the architrave of some vast\r\ngateway, or the pediment of some colossal statue. A cave-like\r\nexcavation, nearly three feet square, and rather more than seven feet in\r\ndepth, opens on its gray and lichened side. The excavation is widened\r\nwithin, along the opposite walls, into two uncomfortably short beds,\r\nvery much resembling those of the cabin of a small coasting vessel. One\r\nof the two is furnished with a protecting ledge and a pillow of stone,\r\nhewn out of the solid mass, while the other, which is some five or six\r\ninches shorter than its neighbor, and presents altogether more the\r\nappearance of a place of penance than of repose, lacks both cushion and\r\nledge. An aperture, which seems to have been originally of a circular\r\nform, and about two and a half feet in diameter, but which some unlucky\r\nherd-boy, apparently in the want of better employment, has considerably\r\nmutilated and widened, opens at the inner excavation of the extremity\r\nto the roof, as the hatch of a vessel opens from the hold to the deck;\r\nfor it is by far too wide in proportion to the size of the apartment to\r\nbe regarded as a chimney. A gray, rudely-hewn block of sandstone, which,\r\nthough greatly too ponderous to be moved by any man of the ordinary\r\nstrength, seems to have served the purpose of a door, lies prostrate\r\nbeside the opening in front. And such is the famous Dwarfie Stone of\r\nHoy, as firmly fixed in our literature by the genius of Sir Walter\r\nScott, as in this wild valley by its ponderous weight and breadth of\r\nbase, and regarding which--for it shares in the general obscurity of the\r\nother ancient remains of Orkney--the antiquary can do little more than\r\nrepeat, somewhat incredulously, what tradition tells him, viz., that it\r\nwas the work, many ages ago, of an ugly, malignant goblin, half-earth\r\nhalf-air,--the Elfin Trolld,--a personage, it is said, that even within\r\nthe last century, used occasionally to be seen flitting about in its\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in a fine breezy day, clear and sunshiny, save where the\r\nshadows of a few dense piled-up clouds swept dark athwart the landscape.\r\nIn the secluded recesses of the valley all was hot, heavy and still;\r\nthough now and then a fitful snatch of a breeze, the mere fragment of\r\nsome broken gust that seemed to have lost its way, tossed for a moment\r\nthe white cannach of the bogs, or raised spirally into the air, for a\r\nfew yards, the light beards of some seeding thistle, and straightway let\r\nthem down again. Suddenly, however, about noon, a shower broke thick and\r\nheavy against the dark sides and gray scalp of the Ward Hill, and came\r\nsweeping down the valley. I did what Norna of the Fitful Head had,\r\naccording to the novelist, done before me in similar circumstances,\r\ncrept for shelter into the larger bed of the cell, which, though rather\r\nscant, taken fairly lengthwise, for a man of five feet eleven, I found,\r\nby stretching myself diagonally from corner to corner, no very\r\nuncomfortable lounging-place in a thunder-shower. Some provident\r\nherd-boy had spread it over, apparently months before, with a littering\r\nof heath and fern, which now formed a dry, springy conch; and as I lay\r\nwrapped up in my plaid, listening to the rain-drops as they pattered\r\nthick and heavy atop, or slanted through the broken hatchway to the\r\nvacant bed on the opposite side of the excavation, I called up the wild\r\nnarrative of Norna, and felt all its poetry. The opening passage of the\r\nstory is, however, not poetry, but good prose, in which the curious\r\nvisitor might give expression to his own conjectures, if ingenious\r\nenough either to form or to express them so well. \"With my eyes fixed on\r\nthe smaller bed,\" the sorceress is made to say, \"I wearied myself with\r\nconjectures regarding the origin and purpose of my singular place of\r\nrefuge. Had it been really the work of that powerful Trolld to whom the\r\npoetry of the Scalds referred it? or was it the tomb of some\r\nScandinavian chief, interred with his arms and his wealth, perhaps also\r\nwith his immolated wife, that what he loved best in life might not in\r\ndeath be divided from him? or was it the abode of penance chosen by some\r\ndevoted anchorite of later days? or the idle work of some wandering\r\nmechanic, whom chance, and whim, and leisure, had thrust upon such an\r\nundertaking?\" What follows this sober passage is the work of the poet.\r\n\"Sleep,\" continues Norna, \"had gradually crept upon me among my\r\nlucubrations, when I was startled from my slumbers by a second clap of\r\nthunder, and when I awoke, I saw through the dim light which the upper\r\naperture admitted, the unshapely and indistinct form of Trolld the\r\ndwarf, seated opposite to me on the lesser couch, which his square and\r\nmisshapen bulk seemed absolutely to fill up. I was startled, but not\r\naffrighted; for the blood of the ancient race of Lochlin was warm in my\r\nveins. He spoke, and his words were of Norse,--so old, that few save my\r\nfather, or I myself could have comprehended their import,--such language\r\nas was spoken in these islands ere Olave planted his cross on the ruins\r\nof heathenism. His meaning was dark also, and obscure, like that which\r\nthe pagan priests were wont to deliver, in the name of their idols, to\r\nthe tribes that assembled at the _Helgafels_.... I answered him in\r\nnearly the same strain, for the spirit of the ancient Scalds of our race\r\nwas upon me; and far from fearing the phantom with whom I sat cooped\r\nwithin so narrow a space, I felt the impulse of that high courage which\r\nthrust the ancient champions and Druidesses upon contests with the\r\ninvisible world, when they thought that the earth no longer contained\r\nenemies worthy to be subdued by them.... The Demon scowled at me as if\r\nat once incensed and overawed; and then, coiling himself up in a thick\r\nand sulphurous vapor, he disappeared from his place. I did not till that\r\nmoment feel the influence of fright, but then it seized me. I rushed\r\ninto the open air, where the tempest had passed away, and all was pure\r\nand serene.\" Shall I dare confess, that I could fain have passed some\r\nstormy night all alone in this solitary cell, were it but to enjoy the\r\nluxury of listening, amid the darkness, to the clashing rain and the\r\nroar of the wind high among the cliffs, or to detect the brushing sound\r\nof hasty footsteps in the wild rustle of the heath, or the moan of\r\nunhappy spirits in the low roar of the distant sea. Or, mayhap,--again\r\nto borrow from the poet,--as midnight was passing into morning,\r\n\r\n \"To ponder o'er some mystic lay,\r\n Till the wild tale had all its sway;\r\n And in the bittern's distant shriek\r\n I heard unearthly voices speak,\r\n Or thought the wizard priest was come\r\n To claim again his ancient home!\r\n And bade my busy fancy range\r\n To frame him fitting shape and strange;\r\n Till from the dream my brow I cleared,\r\n And smiled to think that I had feared.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dwarfie Stone has been a good deal undervalued by some writers, such\r\nas the historian of Orkney, Mr. Barry; and, considered simply as a work\r\nof art or labor, it certainly does not stand high. When tracing, as I\r\nlay a-bed, the marks of the tool, which, in the harder portions of the\r\nstone, are still distinctly visible, I just thought how that, armed with\r\npick and chisel, and working as I was once accustomed to work, I could\r\ncomplete such another excavation to order in some three weeks or a\r\nmonth. But then, I could not make my excavation a thousand years old,\r\nnor envelop its origin in the sun-gilt vapors of a poetic obscurity, nor\r\nconnect it with the supernatural, through the influences of wild ancient\r\ntraditions, nor yet encircle it with a classic halo, borrowed from the\r\nundying inventions of an exquisite literary genius. A half-worn pewter\r\nspoon, stamped on the back with the word _London_, which was found in a\r\nmiserable hut on the banks of the Awatska by some British sailors, at\r\nonce excited in their minds a thousand tender remembrances of their\r\ncountry. And it would, I suspect, be rather a poor criticism, and\r\nscarcely suited to grapple with the true phenomena of the case, that,\r\nwholly overlooking the magical influences of the associative faculty,\r\nwould concentrate itself simply on either the-workmanship or the\r\nmaterials of the spoon. Nor is the Dwarfie Stone to be correctly\r\nestimated, independently of the suggestive principle, on the rules of\r\nthe mere quarrier who sells stones by the cubic foot, or of the mere\r\ncontractor for hewn work who dresses them by the square one.\r\n\r\nThe pillow I found lettered over with the names of visitors; but the\r\nstone,--an exceedingly compact red sandstone,--had resisted the\r\nimperfect tools at the command of the traveller,--usually a nail or\r\nknife; and so there were but two of the names decipherable,--that of an\r\n\"H. Ross, 1735,\" and that of a \"P. FOLSTER, 1830.\" The rain still\r\npattered heavily overhead; and with my geological chisel and hammer I\r\ndid, to beguile the time, what I very rarely do,--added my name to the\r\nothers, in characters which, if both they and the Dwarfie Stone get but\r\nfair play, will be distinctly legible two centuries hence. In what state\r\nwill the world then exist, or what sort of ideas will fill the head of\r\nthe man who, when the rock has well-nigh yielded up its charge, will\r\ndecipher the name for the last time, and inquire, mayhap, regarding the\r\nindividual whom it now designates, as I did this morning, when I asked,\r\n\"Who was this H. Ross, and who this P. Folster?\" I remember when it\r\nwould have saddened me to think that there would in all probability be\r\nas little response in the one case as in the other; but as men rise in\r\nyears they become more indifferent than in early youth to \"that life\r\nwhich wits inherit after death,\" and are content to labor on and be\r\nobscure. They learn, too, if I may judge from experience, to pursue\r\nscience more exclusively for its own sake, with less, mayhap, of\r\nenthusiasm to carry them on, but with what is at least as strong to take\r\nits place as a moving force, that wind and bottom of formed habit\r\nthrough which what were at first acts of the will pass into easy\r\nhalf-instinctive promptings of the disposition. In order to acquaint\r\nmyself with the fossiliferous deposits of Scotland, I have travelled,\r\nhammer in hand, during the last nine years, over fully ten thousand\r\nmiles; nor has the work been in the least one of dry labor,--not more so\r\nthan that of the angler, or grouse-shooter, or deer-stalker: it has\r\noccupied the mere leisure interstices of a somewhat busy life, and has\r\nserved to relieve its toils. I have succeeded, however, in\r\naccomplishing but little: besides, what is discovery to-day will be but\r\nrudimentary fact to the tyro-geologists of the future. But if much has\r\nnot been done, I have at least the consolation of George Buchanan, when,\r\naccording to Melvill, \"fand sitting in his chair, teiching his young man\r\nthat servit him in his chalmer to spell a, b, ab; e, b, eb. 'Better\r\nthis,' quoth he, 'nor stelling sheipe.'\"\r\n\r\nThe sun broke out in great beauty after the shower, glistening on a\r\nthousand minute runnels that came streaming down the precipices, and\r\nrevealing, through the thin vapory haze, the horizontal lines of strata\r\nthat bar the hill-sides, like courses of ashlar in a building. I failed,\r\nhowever, to detect, amid the general many-pointed glitter by which the\r\nblue gauze-like mist was bespangled, the light of the great carbuncle\r\nfor which the Ward Hill has long been famous,--that wondrous gem,\r\naccording to Sir Walter, \"that, though it gleams ruddy as a furnace to\r\nthem that view it from beneath, ever becomes invisible to him whose\r\ndaring foot scales the precipices whence it darts its splendor.\" The\r\nHill of Hoy is, however, not the only one in the kingdom that, according\r\nto tradition, bears a jewel in its forehead. The \"great diamond\" of the\r\nNorthern Sutor was at one time scarce less famous than the carbuncle of\r\nthe Ward Hill. \"I have been oftener than once interrogated on the western\r\ncoast of Scotland regarding the diamond rock of Cromarty; and have been\r\ntold, by an old campaigner who fought under Abercrombie, that he has\r\nlistened to the familiar story of its diamond amid the sand wastes of\r\nEgypt.\" But the diamond has long since disappeared; and we now see only\r\nthe rock. Unlike the carbuncle of Hoy, it was never seen by day; though\r\noften, says the legend, the benighted boatmen has gazed, from amid the\r\ndarkness, as he came rowing along the shore, on its clear beacon-like\r\nflame, which, streaming from the precipice, threw a fiery strip across\r\nthe water; and often have the mariners of other countries inquired\r\nwhether the light which they saw so high among the cliffs, right over\r\ntheir mast, did not proceed from the shrine of some saint or the cell of\r\nsome hermit. At length an ingenious ship-captain determined on marking\r\nits place, brought with him from England a few balls of chalk, and took\r\naim at it in the night-time with one of his great guns. Ere he had\r\nfired, however, it vanished, as if suddenly withdrawn by some guardian\r\nhand; and its place in the rock front has ever since remained as\r\nundistinguishable, whether by night or by day, as the scaurs and clefts\r\naround it. The marvels of the present time abide examination more\r\npatiently. It seems difficult enough to conceive, for instance, that the\r\nupper deposit of the Lower Old Red in this locality, out of which the\r\nmountains of Hoy have been scooped, once overlaid the flag stones of all\r\nOrkney, and stretched on and away to Dunnet Head, Tarbet Ness, and the\r\nBlack Isle; and yet such is the story, variously authenticated, to which\r\ntheir nearly horizontal strata, and their abrupt precipices lend their\r\ntestimony. In no case has this superior deposit of the formation of the\r\nCoccosteus been known to furnish a single fossil; nor did it yield me on\r\nthis occasion, among the Hills of Hoy, what it had denied me everywhere\r\nelse on every former one. Sly search, however, was by no means either\r\nvery prolonged or very careful.\r\n\r\nI found I had still several hours of day-light before me; and these I\r\nspent, after my return on a rough tumbling sea to Stromness, in a second\r\nsurvey of the coast, westwards from the granitic axis of the island, to\r\nthe bishop's palace, and the ichthyolitic quarry beyond. From this point\r\nof view the high terminal Hill of Hoy, towards the west, presents what\r\nis really a striking profile of Sir Walter Scott, sculptured in the rock\r\nfront by the storms of ages, on so immense a scale, that the Colossus of\r\nRhodes, Pharos and all, would scarce have furnished materials enough to\r\nsupply it with a nose. There are such asperities in the outline as one\r\nmight expect in that of a rudely modelled bust, the work of a master,\r\nfrom which, in his fiery haste, he had not detached the superfluous\r\nclay; but these interfere in no degree with the fidelity, I had almost\r\nsaid spirit, of the likeness. It seems well, as it must have waited for\r\nthousands of years ere it became the portrait it now is, that the human\r\nprofile, which it preceded so long, and without which it would have\r\nlacked the element of individual truth, should have been that of Sir\r\nWalter. Amid scenes so heightened in interest by his genius as those of\r\nOrkney, he is entitled to a monument. To the critical student of the\r\nphilosophy and history of poetic invention it is not uninstructive to\r\nobserve how completely the novelist has appropriated and brought within\r\nthe compass of one fiction, in defiance of all those lower probabilities\r\nwhich the lawyer who pleaded before a jury court would be compelled to\r\nrespect, almost every interesting scene and object in both the Shetland\r\nand Orkney islands. There was but little intercourse in those days\r\nbetween the two northern archipelagos. It is not yet thirty years since\r\nthey communicated with each other, chiefly through the port of Leith,\r\nwhere their regular traders used to meet monthly; but it was necessary,\r\nfor purposes of effect, that the dreary sublimities of Shetland should\r\nbe wrought up into the same piece of rich tissue with the imposing\r\nantiquities of Orkney,--Sumburgh Head and Roost with the ancient\r\nCathedral of St. Magnus and the earl's palace, and Fitful Head and the\r\nsand-enveloped kirk of St. Ringan with the Standing Stones of Stennis\r\nand the Dwarfie Stone of Hoy; and so the little jury-court probabilities\r\nhave been sacrificed without scruple, and that higher truth of\r\ncharacter, and that exquisite portraiture of external nature, which give\r\nsuch reality to fiction, and make it sink into the mind more deeply than\r\nhistoric fact, have been substituted instead. But such,--considerably to\r\nthe annoyance of the lesser critics,--has been ever the practice of the\r\ngreater poets. The lesser critics are all critics of the jury-court\r\ncast; while all the great masters of fiction, with Shakspeare at their\r\nhead, have been asserters of that higher truth which is not letter, but\r\nspirit, and contemners of the mere judicial probabilities. And so they\r\nhave been continually fretting the little men with their extravagances,\r\nand they ever will. What were said to be the originals of two of Sir\r\nWalter's characters in the \"Pirate\" were living in the neighborhood of\r\nStromness only a few years ago. An old woman who resided immediately\r\nover the town, in a little cottage, of which there now remains only the\r\nroofless walls, and of whom the sailors, weather-bound in the port, used\r\noccasionally to purchase a wind, furnished him with the first conception\r\nof his Norna of the Fitful Head; and an eccentric shopkeeper of the\r\nplace, who to his dying day used to designate the \"Pirate,\" with much\r\nbitterness, as a \"lying book,\" and its author as a \"wicked lying man,\"\r\nis said to have suggested the character of Bryce Snailsfoot the peddler.\r\nTo the sorceress Sir Walter himself refers in one of his notes. \"At the\r\nvillage of Stromness, on the Orkney main island, called Pomona, lived,\"\r\nhe says, \"in 1814, an aged dame called Bessie Millie, who helped out her\r\nsubsistence by selling favorable winds to mariners. Her dwelling and\r\nappearance were not unbecoming her pretensions: her house, which was on\r\nthe brow of the steep hill on which Stromness is founded, was only\r\naccessible by a series of dirty and precipitous lanes, and, for\r\nexposure, might have been the abode of Aeolus himself, in whose\r\ncommodities the inhabitant dealt. She herself was, as she told us,\r\nnearly one hundred years old, withered and dried up like a mummy. A\r\nclay-colored kerchief, folded round her head, corresponded in color to\r\nher corpse-like complexion. Two light-blue eyes that gleamed with a\r\nlustre like that of insanity, an utterance of astonishing rapidity, a\r\nnose and chin that almost met together, and a ghastly expression of\r\ncunning, gave her the effect of Hecate. She remembered Gow the pirate,\r\nwho had been a native of these islands, in which he closed his career.\r\nSuch was Bessie Millie, to whom the mariners paid a sort of tribute,\r\nwith a feeling betwixt jest and earnest.\"\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of Stromness, where the arm of the sea, which forms\r\nthe harbor, is about a quarter of a mile in width, there is, immediately\r\nover the shore, a small square patch of ground, apparently a\r\n_planticruive_, or garden, surrounded by a tall dry-stone fence. It is\r\nall that survives--for the old dwelling-house to which it was attached\r\nwas pulled down several years ago--of the patrimony of Gow the \"Pirate;\"\r\nand is not a little interesting, as having formed the central nucleus\r\nround which,--like those bits of thread or wire on which the richly\r\nsaturated fluids of the chemist solidify and crystallize,--the entire\r\nfiction of the novelist aggregated and condensed under the influence of\r\nforces operative only in minds of genius. A white, tall, old-fashioned\r\nhouse, conspicuous on the hill-side, looks out across the bay towards\r\nthe square inclosure, which it directly fronts. And it is surely a\r\ncurious coincidence, that while in one of these two erections, only a\r\nfew hundred yards apart, one of the heroes of Scott saw the light, the\r\nother should have proved the scene of the childhood of one of the heroes\r\nof Byron,\r\n\r\n \"Torquil, the nursling of the northern seas.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember, that in Byron's poem of \"The Island,\" one of\r\nthe younger leaders of the mutineers is described as a native of these\r\nnorthern isles. He is drawn by the poet, amid the wild luxuriance of an\r\nisland of the Pacific, as\r\n\r\n           \"The blue-eyed northern child,\r\n Of isles more known to man, but scarce less wild,--\r\n The fair-haired offspring of the Orcades,\r\n Where roars the Pentland with his whirling seas,--\r\n Rocked in his cradle by the roaring wind,\r\n The tempest-born in body and in mind,--\r\n His young eyes, opening on the ocean foam,--\r\n Had from that moment deemed the deep his home.\"\r\n\r\nJudging from what I learned of his real history, which is well known in\r\nStromness, I found reason to conclude that he had been a hapless young\r\nman, of a kindly, genial nature; and greatly \"more sinned against than\r\nsinning,\" in the unfortunate affair of the mutiny with which his name is\r\nnow associated, and for his presumed share in which, untried and\r\nunconvicted, he was cruelly left to perish in chains amid the horrors of\r\na shipwreck. I had the honor of being introduced on the following day to\r\nhis sister, a lady far advanced in life, but over whose erect form and\r\nhandsome features the years seemed to have passed lightly, and whom I\r\nmet at the Free Church of Stromness, to which, at the Disruption, she\r\nhad followed her respected minister. It seemed a fact as curiously\r\ncompounded as some of those pictures of the last age in which the thin\r\nunsubstantialities of allegory mingled with the tangibilities of the\r\nreal and the material, that the sister of one of Byron's heroes should\r\nbe an attached member of the Free Church.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the inn, I found in the public room a young German of\r\nsome one or two and twenty, who, in making the tour of Scotland, had\r\nextended his journey into Orkney. My specimens, which had begun to\r\naccumulate in the room, on chimney-piece and window-sill, had attracted\r\nhis notice, and led us into conversation. He spoke English well, but not\r\nfluently,--in the style of one who had been more accustomed to read than\r\nto converse in it; and he seemed at least as familiar with two of our\r\ngreat British authors,--Shakspeare and Sir Walter Scott,--as most of the\r\nbetter-informed British themselves. It was chiefly the descriptions of\r\nSir Walter in the \"Pirate\" that had led him into Orkney. He had already\r\nvisited the Cathedral of St. Magnus and the Stones of Stennis; and on\r\nthe morrow he intended visiting the Dwarfie Stone; though I ventured to\r\nsuggest that, as a broad sound lay between Stromness and Hoy, and as the\r\nmorrow was the Sabbath, he might find some difficulty in doing that. His\r\ncircle of acquirement was, I found, rather literary than scientific. It\r\nseemed, however, to be that of a really accomplished young man, greatly\r\nbetter founded in his scholarship than most of our young Scotchmen on\r\nquitting the national universities; and I felt, as we conversed\r\ntogether, chiefly on English literature and general politics, how much\r\npoorer a figure I would have cut in his country than he cut in mine. I\r\nfound, on coming down from my room next morning to a rather late\r\nbreakfast, that he had been out among the Stromness fishermen, and had\r\nreturned somewhat chafed. Not a single boatman could he find in a\r\npopulous seaport town that would undertake to carry him to the Dwarfie\r\nStone on the Sabbath,--a fact, to their credit, which it is but simple\r\njustice to state. I saw him afterwards in the Free Church, listening\r\nattentively to a thoroughly earnest and excellent discourse, by the\r\nDisruption minister of the parish, Mr. Learmonth; and in the course of\r\nthe evening he dropped in for a short time to the Free Church\r\nSabbath-school, where he took his seat beside one of the teachers, as if\r\ncurious to ascertain more in detail the character of the instruction\r\nwhich had operated so influentially on the boatmen, and which he had\r\nseen telling from the pulpit with such evident effect. What would not\r\nhis country now give,--now, while drifting loose from all its old\r\nmoorings, full on the perils of a lee shore,--for the anchor of a faith\r\nequally steadfast! He was a Lutheran, he told me; but, as is too common\r\nin Germany, his actual beliefs appeared to be very considerably at\r\nvariance with his hereditary creed. The creed was a tolerably sound one,\r\nbut the living belief regarding it seemed to do little more than take\r\ncognizance of what he deemed the fact of its death.\r\n\r\nI had carried with me a letter of introduction to Mr. William Watt, to\r\nwhom I have already had occasion to refer as an intelligent geologist;\r\nbut the letter I had no opportunity of delivering. Mr. Watt had learned,\r\nhowever, of my being in the neighborhood, and kindly walked into\r\nStromness, some six or eight miles, on the morning of Monday, to meet\r\nwith me, bringing me a few of his rarer specimens. One of the number,--a\r\nminute ichthyolite, about three inches in length,--I was at first\r\ndisposed to set down as new, but I have since come to regard it as\r\nsimply an imperfectly-preserved specimen of a Cromarty and Morayshire\r\nspecies,--the _Glyptolepis microlepidotus_; though its state of keeping\r\nis such as to render either conclusion an uncertainty. Another of the\r\nspecimens was that of a fish, still comparatively rare, first figured in\r\nthe first edition of my little volume on the \"Old Red Sandstone,\" from\r\nthe earliest found specimen, at a time while it was yet unfurnished with\r\na name, but which has since had a place assigned to it in the genus\r\nDiplacanthus, as the species longispinus. The scales, when examined by\r\nthe glass, remind one, from their pectinated character, of shells\r\ncovering the walls of a grotto,--a peculiarity to which, when showing my\r\nspecimen to Agassiz, while it had yet no duplicate, I directed his\r\nattention, and which led him to extemporize for it, on the spot, the\r\ngeneric name Ostralepis, or shell-scale. On studying it more leisurely,\r\nhowever, in the process of assigning to it a place in his great work,\r\nwhere the reader may now find it figured (Table XIV., fig. 8), the\r\nnaturalist found reason to rank it among the Diplacanthi. Mr. Watt's\r\nspecimen exhibited the outline of the head more completely than mine;\r\nbut the Orkney ichthyolites rarely present the microscopic minutiae; and\r\nthe shell-like aspect of the scales was shown in but one little patch,\r\nwhere they had left their impressions on the stone. His other specimens\r\nconsisted of single plates of a variety of Coccosteus, undistinguishable\r\nin their form and proportions from those of the _Coccosteus decipiens_,\r\nbut which exceeded by about one-third the average size of the\r\ncorresponding parts in that species; and of a rib-like bone, that\r\nbelonged apparently to what few of the ichthyolites of the Lower Old Red\r\nseem to have possessed,--an osseous internal skeleton. This last\r\norganism was the only one I saw in Orkney with which I had not been\r\npreviously acquainted, or which I could regard as new, though possibly\r\nenough it may have formed part, not of an undiscovered genus, but of the\r\nknown genus Asterolepis, of whose inner framework, judging from the\r\nRussian specimens at least, portions must have been bony. After parting\r\nfrom Mr. Watt, I travelled on to Kirkwall, which, after a leisurely\r\njourney, I reached late in the evening, and on the following morning\r\ntook the steamer for Wick. I brought away with me, if not many rare\r\nspecimens or many new geological facts, at least a few pleasing\r\nrecollections of an interesting country and a hospitable people. In the\r\nprevious chapter I indulged in a brief quotation from Mr. David Vedder,\r\nthe sailor-poet of Orkney, and I shall make no apology for availing\r\nmyself in the present, of the vigorous, well-turned stanzas in which he\r\nportrays some of those peculiar features by which the land of his\r\nnativity may be best recognized and most characteristically remembered.\r\n\r\n TO ORKNEY.\r\n\r\n Land of the whirlpool,--torrent,--foam,\r\n   Where oceans meet in madd'ning shock;\r\n The beetling cliff,--the shelving holm,--\r\n   The dark insidious rock.\r\n Land of the bleak, the treeless moor,--\r\n   The sterile mountain, sered and riven,--\r\n The shapeless cairn, the ruined tower,\r\n   Scathed by the bolts of heaven,--\r\n The yawning gulf,--the treacherous sand,--\r\n love thee still, MY NATIVE LAND.\r\n\r\n Land of the dark, the Runic rhyme,--\r\n   The mystic ring,--the cavern hoar,--\r\n The Scandinavian seer, sublime\r\n   In legendary lore.\r\n Land of a thousand sea-kings' graves,--\r\n   Those tameless spirits of the past,\r\n Fierce as their subject arctic waves,\r\n   Or hyperborean blast,--\r\n Though polar billows round thee foam,\r\n I love thee!--thou wert once my home.\r\n\r\n With glowing heart and island lyre,\r\n   Ah! would some native bard arise\r\n To sing, with all a poet's fire,\r\n   Thy stern sublimities,--\r\n The roaring flood,--the rushing stream,--\r\n   The promontory wild and bare,--\r\n The pyramid, where sea-birds scream,\r\n   Aloft in middle air,--\r\n The Druid temple on the heath,\r\n Old even beyond tradition's birth.\r\n\r\n Though I have roamed through verdant glades,\r\n   In cloudless climes, 'neath azure skies,\r\n Or plucked from beauteous orient meads,\r\n   Flowers of celestial dies,--\r\n Though I have laved in limpid streams,\r\n   That murmur over golden sands,\r\n Or basked amid the fulgid beams\r\n   That flame o'er fairer lands,\r\n Or stretched me in the sparry grot,--\r\n My country! THOU wert ne'er forgot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] March 31, 1845.\r\n\r\n[2] Professor Nicol of Aberdeen believes the Red Sandstones of the West\r\nHighlands are of Devonian age, and the quartzite and limestone of Lower\r\nCarboniferous.--_See Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,\r\nFebruary 1857._--W.S.\r\n\r\n[3] Sir R.

Mr. Longmuir of Aberdeen\r\ndescribes a visit to the Lias clay at Blackpots. Mr. Longmuir seems to\r\nhave given more time to his researches than I found it agreeable, in a\r\nvery indifferent day to devote to mine; and his list of fossils is\r\nconsiderably longer. Their evidence, however, runs in exactly the same\r\ntract with that of the shorter list. He had been told at Banff that the\r\nclay contained \"petrified tangles;\" and the first organism shown him by\r\nthe workmen, on his arrival at the deposit, were some of the \"tangles\"\r\nin question. \"These\" he goes on to say, \"we found, as may have already\r\nbeen anticipated, to be pieces of Belemnites, well known on the other\r\nside of the Frith as 'thunderbolts,' and esteemed of sovereign efficacy\r\nin the cure of bewitched cattle.\" Though still wide of the mark, there\r\nis here an evident descent from the supernatural to the physical, from\r\nthe superstitious to the true. \"Satisfied that we had a mass of Lias\r\nclay before us, we set vigorously to work, in order either to find\r\nadditional characteristic fossils, or obtain data on which to form a\r\nconjecture as to the history of this out-of-the-way deposit; and our\r\nlabor was not without its reward. We shall now present a brief account\r\nof the specimens we picked up. Observing a number of stones of different\r\nsizes, that had been thrown out, as they were struck, by the workman's\r\nshovel, we immediately commenced, and, like an inquisitor of old,\r\nknocked our victims on the head, that they might reveal their secrets;\r\nor, like a Roman haruspex, examined their interior,--not, however, to\r\nobtain a knowledge of the future, but only to take a peep into the past.\r\n1. Here, then, we take up, not a regular Lias lime nodule, but what\r\nappears to have formed part of one; and the first blow has laid open\r\npart of a whorl of an Ammonite, which, when complete, must have measured\r\nthree or four inches in diameter, and it is perfectly assimilated to the\r\ncalcareous matrix. 2. Here is a mass of indurated clay; and a gentle\r\nblow has exposed part of two Ammonites, smaller than the former, but\r\ntheir shells are white and powdery like chalk. 3. Another fragment is\r\nlaid open; and there, quite unmistakably, lie the umbo and greater\r\nportion of the _Plagiostoma concentricum_. 4. Another fragment of a\r\ngranular gritty structure presents a considerable portion of the\r\ninterior of one of the shells of a Pecten, but whether the attached\r\nfragment is part of one of its ears, or of the other valve turned\r\nbackward, is not so easily determined. 5. Here is a piece of Belemnite\r\nin limestone, and the fracture in the fossil presents the usual\r\nglistening planes of cleavage. 6. Next we take up a piece of distinctly\r\nlaminated Lias, with Ammonites as thick as they can lie on the pages of\r\nthis black book of natural history. 7. Once more we strike, and we have\r\nthe cast and part of the shell of another bivalve; but the valves have\r\nbeen jerked off each other, and have suffered a severe compound\r\nfracture; nevertheless we can have little hesitation in pronouncing it a\r\nspecies of _unio_. 8. Here is another piece of limestone, with its small\r\nfragment of another shell, of very delicate texture, with finely marked\r\ntraverse striae. We are unwilling to decide on such slight evidence, but\r\nfeel inclined to refer it to some species of Plagiostoma. 9. Here is a\r\npiece of pyrites, not quite so large as the first, and so vegetable-like\r\nin its markings, that it might be mistaken for part of a branch of a\r\ntree. This is also characteristic of the Lias; for when the shales are\r\ndeeply impregnated with bitumen and pyrites, they undergo a slow\r\ncombustion when heaped up with faggots and set on fire; and in the\r\ncliffs of the Yorkshire coast, after rainy weather, they sometimes\r\nspontaneously ignite, and continue to burn for several months. 10. As we\r\npassed through the works, on our way to the clay, we observed a sort of\r\nreservoir, into which the clay, after being freed from its impurities,\r\nhad been run in a liquid state; the water had evaporated, and the drying\r\nclay had cracked in every direction. Here we find its counterpart in\r\nthis large mass of stone; only the clay here, mixed with a portion of\r\nlime is petrified, and the fissures filled up with carbonate of lime;\r\nthus forming the septaria, or cement stone. We have dressed a specimen\r\nof it for our guide, who has a friend that will polish it, when the dark\r\nLias will be strikingly contrasted with the white lime, and form rather\r\na pretty piece of natural mosaic. 11. Coming to a simple piece of\r\nmachinery for removing fragments of shale and stone from the clay, we\r\nexamined some of the bits so rejected, and found what we had no doubt\r\nwere fish-scales. 12. We have yet to notice certain long slender bodies,\r\noutwardly brown, but inwardly nearly black, resembling whip-cord in\r\nsize. Are we to regard these as specimens of a fucus, perhaps the\r\n_filum_, or allied to it, which is known in some places by the\r\nappropriate name of sea-laces? 13. Passing on to the office, we were\r\nshown a chop of wood that had been found in the clay, and was destined\r\nfor the Banff Museum. It is about eighteen inches in length, and half as\r\nmuch in breadth; and although evidently water-worn, yet we could count\r\nbetween twenty-five and thirty concentric rings on one of its ends,\r\nwhich not only enabled us to form some conjecture of its age previous to\r\nits overthrow, but also justified us in referring it to the coniferae of\r\nthe _vorwelt_, or ancient world.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Longmuir makes the following shrewd remarks, in answering the\r\nquestion, \"Whether have we here a mass of Lias clay, as originally\r\ndeposited, or has it resulted from the breaking up of Lias-shale?\" \"The\r\nformer alternative,\" says Mr. Longmuir, \"we have heard, has been\r\nmaintained; but we are inclined to adopt the latter, and that for the\r\nfollowing reasons: 1. This clay, judging from other localities, is not\r\n_in situ_, but has every appearance of having been precipitated into a\r\nbasin in the gneiss on which it rests, having apparently under it,\r\nalthough it is impossible to say to what extent, a bed of comminuted\r\nshells. 2. The fossils are all fragmentary and water-worn. This is\r\nespecially the case with regard to the Belemnites, the pieces averaging\r\nfrom one to two inches in length, no workman having ever found a\r\ncomplete specimen, such as occurs in the Lias-shale at Cromarty, in\r\nwhich they may be found nine inches in length. 3. But perhaps the most\r\nsatisfactory proof, and one that in itself may be deemed sufficient, is\r\nthe frequent occurrence of pieces of Lias-shale, with their embedded\r\nAmmonites; which clearly show that the Lias had been broken up, tossed\r\nabout in some violent agitation of the sea, and churned into clay, just\r\nas some denudating process of a similar nature swept away the chalk of\r\nAberdeenshire, leaving on many of its hills and plains the water-worn\r\nflints, with the characteristic fossils of the Cretaceous formation.\"\r\n\r\n[12] A description of Miss Bond and of her \"Letters\" here referred to,\r\nis given in the fifth chapter of \"My Schools and Schoolmasters.\"\r\n\r\n[13] The story here referred to is narrated in \"Scenes and Legends of\r\nthe North of Scotland,\" chap. XXV.\r\n\r\n[14] _Scaur_, Scotice, a precipice of clay. There is no single English\r\nword that conveys exactly the same idea.\r\n\r\n[15] Mr. Dick has since disinterred from out the boulder-clays of the\r\nBurn of Freswick, _Patella vulgata_, _Buccinum undatum_, _Fesus\r\nantiquus_, _Rostellaria_, _Pes pelicana_, a _Natica_, _Lutraria_, and\r\n_Balanus_.\r\n\r\n[16] That similarity of condition in which the hazel and the harder\r\ncerealia thrive was noted by our north-country farmers of the old\r\nSchool, long ere it had been recorded by the botanist. Hence such\r\nremarks, familiarized into proverbs, as \"A good _nut_ year's a good\r\n_ait_ year;\" or, \"As the _nut_ fills the _ait_ fills.\"\r\n\r\n[17] For this story, see \"Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland,\"\r\nchap. XXV.\r\n\r\n[18] \"In the River St. Lawrence,\" says Sir Charles Lyell, \"the loose ice\r\naccumulates on the shoals during the winter, at which season the water\r\nis low. The separate fragments of ice are readily frozen together in a\r\nclimate where the temperature is sometimes thirty degrees below zero,\r\nand boulders become entangled with them; so that in the spring, when the\r\nriver rises on the melting of the snow, the rocks are floated off,\r\nfrequently conveying away the boulders to great distances. A single\r\nblock of granite, fifteen feet long by ten feet both in width and\r\nheight, and which could not contain less than fifteen hundred cubic feet\r\nof stone, was in this way moved down the river several hundred yards,\r\nduring the late survey in 1837. Heavy anchors of ships, lying on the\r\nshore, have in like manner been closed in and removed. In October 1836,\r\nwooden stakes were driven several feet into the ground, at one point on\r\nthe banks of the St. Lawrence, at high-water mark, and over them were\r\npiled many boulders as large as the united force of six men could roll.\r\nThe year after, all the boulders had disappeared, and others had\r\narrived, and the stakes had been drawn out and carried away by the\r\nice.\"--'Elements,' first edition, p. 138.\r\n\r\n[19] The story of the Lady of Balconie and her keys is narrated in\r\n\"Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland.\" chap.

IV.\r\n\r\n[21] See \"My Schools and Schoolmasters,\" chap XI.\r\n\r\n[22] I can entertain no doubt that the angular groups of palatal teeth\r\nfigured by Agassiz and the Russian geologists as those of a supposed\r\nPlacoid termed the Ctenodus, are in reality groups of the palatal teeth\r\nof Dipterus. In some of my specimens the frontal buckler of Polyphractus\r\nis connected with the gill-covers and scales of Dipterus, and bears in\r\nits palate what cannot he distinguished from the teeth of Ctenodus. The\r\nthree genera resolve themselves into one.\r\n\r\n[23] There is a very admirable remark to this effect in the \"Travelling\r\nMemorandums\" of the late Lord Gardenstone, which, as the work has been\r\nlong out of print, and is now scarce, may be new to many of my readers:\r\n\"It is certain, and demonstrated by the experience of ages and nations,\"\r\nsays his Lordship, in referring to the old principalities of France,\r\n\"that the government of petty princes is less favorable to the security\r\nand interests of society than the government of monarchs, who possess\r\ngreat and extensive territories. The race of great monarchs cannot\r\npossibly preserve a safe and undisturbed state of government, without\r\nmany delegations of power and office to men of approved abilities and\r\npractical knowledge, who are subject to complaint during their\r\nadministration, and responsible when it is at an end; or yet without an\r\nestablished system of laws and regulations; so that no inconsiderable\r\ndegree of security and liberty to the subject is almost inseparable\r\nfrom, and essential to, the subsistence and duration of a great\r\nmonarchy. But it is easy for petty princes to practise an arbitrary and\r\nirregular exercise of power, by which their people are reduced to a\r\ncondition of miserable slavery. Indeed, very few of them, in the course\r\nof ages, are capable of conceiving any other means of maintaining the\r\nostentatious state, the luxurious and indolent pride, which they mistake\r\nfor greatness. I heartily wish that this observation and censure may\r\nnot, in some instances, be applicable to great landed proprietors in\r\nsome parts of Britain.\"--Travelling Memorandums, vol. i. p. 123. 1792.\r\n\r\n[24] The exciting effects of a poor soil, or climate, or of severe\r\nusage, on the productive powers of various vegetable species, have been\r\nlong and often remarked. Flavel describes, in one of his ingenious\r\nemblems, illustrative of the influence of affliction on the Christian,\r\nan orchard tree, which had been beaten with sticks and stones, till it\r\npresented a sorely stunted and mutilated appearance; but which, while\r\nthe fairer and more vigorous trees around it were rich in only leaves,\r\nwas laden with fruit,--a direct consequence, it is shown, of the hard\r\ntreatment to which it had been subjected. I have heard it told in a\r\nnorthern village, as a curious anecdote, that a large pear tree, which\r\nduring a vigorous existence of nearly fifty years, had borne scarce a\r\nsingle pear, had, when in a state of decay, and for a few years previous\r\nto its death, borne immense crops of from two to three bolls each\r\nseason. And the skilful gardener not unfrequently avails himself of the\r\nprinciple on which both phenomena seem to have occurred,--that exhibited\r\nin the beaten and that in the decaying tree,--in rendering his barren\r\nplants fruitful. He has recourse to it even when merely desirous of\r\nascertaining the variety of pear or apple which some thriving sapling,\r\nslow in bearing, is yet to produce. Selecting some bough which may be\r\nconveniently lopped away without destroying the symmetry of the tree, he\r\ndraws his knife across the bark, and inflicts on it a wound, from which,\r\nthough death may not ensue for some two or three twelvemonths, it cannot\r\nultimately recover. Next spring the wounded branch is found to bear its\r\nbunches of blossoms; the blossoms set into fruit; and while in the other\r\nportions of the plant all is vigorous and barren as before, the dying\r\npart of it, as if sobered by the near prospect of dissolution, is found\r\nfulfilling the proper end of its existence. Soil and climate, too,\r\nexert, it has been often remarked, a similar influence. In the united\r\nparishes of Kirkmichael and Culicuden, in the immediate neighborhood of\r\nCromarty, much of the soil is cold and poor, and the exposure ungenial;\r\nand \"in most parts, where hardwood has been planted,\" says the Rev. Mr.\r\nSage of Resolis, in his \"Statistical Account,\" \"it is stinted in its\r\ngrowth, and bark-bound. Comparatively young trees of ash,\" he shrewdly\r\nadds, \"_are covered with seed_,--_an almost infallible sign that their\r\nnatural growth is checked_. The leaves, too, fall off about the\r\nbeginning of September.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUABLE\r\n\r\nLITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC WORKS,\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED BY\r\n\r\nGOULD AND LINCOLN,\r\n\r\n59 WASHINGTON STREET, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY FOR 1859; or, Year-Book of Facts in\r\nScience and Art, exhibiting the most important Discoveries and\r\nImprovements in Mechanics, Useful Arts, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry,\r\nAstronomy, Meteorology, Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, Geology, Geography,\r\nAntiquities, &c., together with a list of recent Scientific\r\nPublications; a classified list of Patents; Obituaries of eminent\r\nScientific Men; an Index of Important Papers in Scientific Journals,\r\nReports, &c.
