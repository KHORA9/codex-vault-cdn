But the industry as\r\n     existing there to-day is a vastly different matter, being already\r\n     of great importance, and promising rapid and extensive development.\r\n     It is a young industry, so recently out of its infancy that if this\r\n     report had been written fifteen years ago the section on dairying\r\n     might have been almost as brief as the famous chapter on snakes in\r\n     Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cream Carts at the Factory.]\r\n\r\n     \"The live stock brought to Sydney by Captain Phillip in 1788, and\r\n     sent to propagate their kind at Farm Cove, consisted of one bull,\r\n     four cows, one calf, and seven pigs. Their descendants in 1908\r\n     included about ten and a-half millions of cattle, of which nearly\r\n     two millions were dairy cows. This is about one cow for every two\r\n     persons in the Commonwealth, which seems a large proportion, but as\r\n     it means only one cow for every two square miles in Australia,\r\n     there is ample room for expansion. In Great Britain we have about\r\n     twenty-six cows for every square mile, and only one cow for every\r\n     fifteen people. These figures indicate that in proportion to its\r\n     population Australia is much more of a dairying country than Great\r\n     Britain, but that in proportion to its area, it has developed the\r\n     industry much less extensively, and is still capable of making\r\n     enormous growth. Until within comparatively recent years there was\r\n     little dairying anywhere in the Commonwealth, and what little there\r\n     was appears to have been carried on by somewhat primitive methods.\r\n     Modern developments, the spread of scientific knowledge, the\r\n     fostering care of Government, and, above everything, the advent of\r\n     the separator, of the milking machine, and of the freezer have\r\n     changed all that. To-day the industry is prospering and full of\r\n     promise....\r\n\r\n     \"There is no denying the fact that every State in the Commonwealth\r\n     has extensive districts where dairying could be carried on very\r\n     profitably. Indeed there must be very few parts of the world where\r\n     Nature does so much to help and so little to hinder the provident\r\n     and industrious producer of milk.\r\n\r\n     \"The most important advantage of all is undoubtedly the climate,\r\n     and that, like many another thing of value, is a good servant, but\r\n     a bad master. It would not be easy to overstate the benefit a\r\n     dairyman receives from being relieved of the need for housing,\r\n     hand-feeding, and tending his cows during a long winter. His cows\r\n     are healthier, their feeding costs less, there is no cleaning of\r\n     byres, no washing of floors, no preparing of food, no never-ending\r\n     carting of turnips, no filling of sheds with hay or straw. His\r\n     anxiety, his work, and his expense are reduced by half, through the\r\n     simple agency of a friendly climate. And yet this same climate is\r\n     also his most dangerous enemy.\r\n\r\n     \"There are certainly also adverse influences which must not be\r\n     forgotten, but a careful examination of the whole position will\r\n     probably lead to the conclusion that Australia is, on the whole, a\r\n     good dairyman's country.\r\n\r\n     \"The advantages include:--(1) Cheap land, (2) cheap cows, (3)\r\n     inexpensive buildings, (4) a climate permitting cows to be in the\r\n     open all the year round, (5) a convenient market and a fair price\r\n     at the factories, (6) helpful Government supervision.\r\n\r\n     \"The disadvantages are:--(1) Dear and scarce labour, (2) an\r\n     inferior stock of milk cows, (3) occasional dry seasons, and (4)\r\n     the farmer's inexperience and ignorance of scientific dairying.\"\r\n\r\nThese several points are touched on in this pamphlet in the chapters\r\ndealing with the individual States, but some general remarks are offered\r\nhere in regard to the four points mentioned as operating\r\ndisadvantageously.\r\n\r\n(1) _Dear and Scarce Labour._--Every young country at times experiences\r\nthe difficulty of procuring sufficient skilled assistance to keep pace\r\nwith the rapid expansion of its industries. Australia is no exception.\r\nDairy farmers there have not always been able to obtain experienced\r\nmilkers. The farmer with children old enough to assist him is at a great\r\nadvantage, and some of the most successful dairy farms in the\r\nCommonwealth are worked mainly by the owners and their families. But\r\nwhere the herd is too large, or the family too small, the milking\r\nmachine, which is really a valuable aid to the dairyman, has been\r\npressed into use, with satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fine herd of Holsteins.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that rapid as has been the expansion of this industry\r\nin Australia, its development has been distinctly retarded by the want\r\nof reliable milkers.\r\n\r\nBut what is the farmer's bane is the farm labourer's boon. The scarcity\r\nof labour has checked the farmer's operations, but it gives the man\r\nseeking employment a wider field.\r\n\r\nCompetent milkers readily find employment at $4.80 to $6.00 per week and\r\nkeep. In every important district good dairy hands also have facilities\r\nextended to them for entering into arrangements for dairying on shares,\r\nwith profit to themselves (see pp. 16-18).\r\n\r\n(2) _An Inferior Stock of Milk Cows._--The fact that while in many\r\ndistricts there are to be found dairy herds averaging barely 300 gallons\r\nper cow per annum, with a butter fat percentage of little over 3.5,\r\ncarried on the same class of land as herds which average over 500\r\ngallons per cow, with over 4 per cent. butter fat, will enable any dairy\r\nfarmer to realise how much room there is for improvement in this\r\nthriving young industry, and what scope there is for the man accustomed\r\nto get the best results from his land and his herd. But the Governments\r\nof the respective States afford special facilities by way of importing\r\nand placing at the disposal of farmers stud cattle of the highest\r\nstandards. Private persons are also doing a great deal in importing and\r\nbreeding high-class animals. Herd-testing associations are becoming more\r\nnumerous. Farmers are learning that it is profitable to keep milk\r\nrecords and to cull out of their herds the cows that do not give payable\r\nyields, and pronounced advancement is being made in this direction.\r\n\r\n(3) _Occasional Dry Seasons._--The effects of dry spells, which\r\nsometimes occur even in the best-watered dairying districts, can be\r\ngreatly minimised by the conservation of fodder, by cheap and easy\r\nmethods of silage. So rich is the country in succulent natural grasses,\r\nand so congenial is the climate, that farmers exhibit a tendency to rely\r\ntoo much on the bounty of the seasons. This is what the Scottish\r\nCommission meant when they referred to the friendly climate as being the\r\ndairyman's most dangerous enemy. It is true that in normal years milch\r\ncows may depasture the whole year long on the natural pastures, and on\r\nthis food alone yield milk of magnificent flavour, producing butter and\r\ncheese of the highest quality. But there should be put by to supplement\r\nthe natural fodder during dry times a supply of food either as hay or\r\nsilage. The experts of the various agricultural departments strongly\r\nadvocate the use of the silo, but the advice has not yet been generally\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nAs the loss in the silo is insignificant, it can be realised how cheaply\r\nample stores of the best class of stand-by fodder can be conserved.\r\nSilos to hold 100 tons cost about $480.00 to construct, and a cutter and\r\nelevator about $144.00. To this would have to be added the cost of a\r\nhorse-works or engine, but until a settler is in a position to indulge\r\nin the most up-to-date outfit, he can follow the usual practice of\r\nserving his greenstuff in the form of stack silage, which entails a very\r\nmoderate outlay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Silos, Victoria.]\r\n\r\nMany crops excellent for silage are easily grown, and the cultivation\r\nareas need never be idle for a day at any time of the year. As one crop\r\nbecomes fit to use, the land can be replanted irrespective of weather\r\nconditions. For instance, in spring (September) maize or sorghum can be\r\nsown, either over the whole area at once or at intervals of a week or a\r\nmonth up to January. In three to three and a-half months, during which\r\ntime the pastures are at their best, and there is no need for\r\nsupplementary fodder, the first of the areas will be ready for use as\r\ngreen fodder, or for conversion into silage to serve as a cheap and\r\njuicy winter fodder. In many districts as soon as the earliest-sown\r\nmaize crop is harvested a second maize or sorghum crop is planted, and\r\nby the time that is ready to cut, barley and vetches or field peas can\r\nbe planted to come in to supplement the stores of winter fodder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fine growth of Sorghum--Victoria.--An excellent fodder\r\ncrop.]\r\n\r\nMaize is harvested for silage when the cobs are well filled, and the\r\ngrain is beginning to glaze; at this stage a normal crop will yield\r\nabout 20 tons greenstuff per acre. Sorghum will produce about 15 tons,\r\nand barley and vetches or peas about 10 tons per acre. Wheat and oats\r\nare often grown in order to be cut for hay, and make an excellent\r\nfodder.\r\n\r\nAnother most valuable crop to the dairyman is lucerne, which will keep\r\nin a well-built stack for an indefinite time.\r\n\r\n(4) _The Farmer's inexperience and ignorance of Scientific\r\nDairying._--To this last point the Scottish Commissioners furnish a\r\nreply in their report.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical Australian Dairy Farm.]\r\n\r\n\"A great many,\" the report states, \"of those engaged in producing milk\r\nhave had no training in the business. If a man can milk a cow, or is\r\nwilling to learn, he thinks himself quite able to run a dairy farm. In\r\ntime, if he is intelligent and observant, he becomes as expert at his\r\ntrade as if he had never done anything else; but his experience has\r\ncertainly cost him a good deal. The men who are neither intelligent nor\r\nobservant learn little from experience, and their dairy methods leave\r\nmuch to be desired. It is they who breed their cows anyhow, who keep no\r\nkind of milk records, who think it economy to bring in their cows to the\r\ncalving as hard as wood, who depend entirely on pasture for food, who\r\nmake no provision for drought, who have nothing to learn from anybody,\r\nand who are keeping the reputation of the Australian cow at a level much\r\nbelow respectability. By-and-by, no doubt, this type of man will become\r\nscarcer. The State Governments are doing what is possible to spread\r\nabroad scientific knowledge in dairying matters, and a younger\r\ngeneration is growing up that has been made familiar both with the\r\npractice and the theory of milk production. When their time comes it is\r\ncertain they will make dairying highly profitable. The fact that, with\r\nan average milk yield of 'something under 250 gallons per annum,' the\r\nindustry as a whole is in a prosperous condition affords the most\r\nremarkable testimony possible to the excellence of Australia as a\r\ndairyman's country. What will happen when the average doubles itself,\r\nand attains, as it surely will, the moderate figure of 500 gallons per\r\nannum?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Phenomenal Growth.\r\n\r\nStarting out with splendid natural advantages--a wide range of soils of\r\ngreat fertility, indigenous grasses of high food value, and a congenial\r\nclimate--the dairying industry in Australia has made phenomenal strides.\r\n\r\nThe establishment throughout the chief districts of co-operative\r\nfactories, owned and managed by the farmers themselves, and the\r\nintroduction of cold storage greatly stimulated its growth. During the\r\nlast decade its advancement has been remarkable. The Australian dairy\r\nindustry is based on the world's markets. Every year the demand in\r\nvarious countries for Australian and other dairy and farmyard products\r\nincreases, and the large home market is also expanding.\r\n\r\nThe facilities for supervision, handling, and transportation are\r\nimproving, and Australian dairymen to-day obtain high prices in both\r\nlocal and outside markets for their produce. It is stated that in South\r\nAustralia dairymen who delivered good cream were able to secure from the\r\nfactories an average of $0.22 per lb. from the butter made therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows at once the advance of the dairying industry\r\n(including poultry farming and bee culture):--\r\n\r\n                                       TEN YEARS.\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n    |                         |      1902.     |      1912.     |Increase.|\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n    |Dairy Cows          No   | 1,113,911      |  2,086,885     | 87.34 % |\r\n    |Pigs                No   |   777,289      |    845,255     |  8.88 % |\r\n    |Hives               No   |    80,111      |    167,441     |109.01 % |\r\n    |Production (quantity)--  |                |                |         |\r\n    |  Butter                 |79,572,327 lbs. |187,194,161 lbs.|135.25 % |\r\n    |  Cheese                 |10,005,787 lbs. | 16,160,491 lbs.| 61.50 % |\r\n    |  Bacon and Ham          |30,608,345 lbs. | 54,192,175 lbs.| 77.05 % |\r\n    |  Honey                  | 2,873,763 lbs. |  8,007,492 lbs.|178.63 % |\r\n    |  Beeswax                |    68,243 lbs. |    130,959 lbs.| 91.90 % |\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n\r\n                                       FIVE YEARS.\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n    |                         |      1907.     |      1912.     |Increase.|\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n    |Production (total value) |$74,803,200.00  |$97,344,000.00  | 30.13 % |\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n\r\n                                       TEN YEARS.\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n    |                         |      1902.     |      1912.     |Increase.|\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n    |Exports (Value)--        |                |                |         |\r\n    |  Butter                 | 1,820,371.20   | 16,044,681.60  |         |\r\n    |  Cheese                 |    20,592.00   |     27,648.00  |         |\r\n    |  Condensed Milk         |    55,689.60   |     92,308.80  |         |\r\n    |  Bacon and Hams         |    37,060.80   |    328,814.40  |         |\r\n    |  Lard                   |     6,100.80   |    177,902.40  |         |\r\n    |  Frozen Pork            |    70,339.20   |     79,972.80  |         |\r\n    |  Honey                  |     7,891.20   |      9,235.20  |         |\r\n    |  Other items            |   269,246.40   |     78,859.20  |         |\r\n    |-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n    |        Total            |$2,287,291.20   |$16,839,422.40  |636.21 % |\r\n    +-------------------------+----------------+----------------+---------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Butter Factory.]\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom purchases the great bulk of Australian butter--about\r\n88 per cent.--but considerable quantities also go to Canada, Ceylon,\r\nChina, the Dutch East Indies, Egypt, Hongkong, the Islands of the\r\nPacific, Japan, Philippine Islands, the Straits Settlements and South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nBesides the co-operative factories there are many proprietary concerns,\r\nand the farmer is benefited by the keen competition between them. The\r\nestablishments in the Commonwealth where the manufacture of butter,\r\ncheese, and condensed milk is carried on number several hundreds. They\r\nare distributed throughout all the States, but they are larger and more\r\nnumerous in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Cheese Factory.]\r\n\r\nCream separation and butter-making are often carried on together under\r\nthe co-operative system. The creation of large central butter factories,\r\nsupplied by numerous separating establishments or \"creameries,\" has\r\nresulted in a considerable reduction in the cost of manufacture, since\r\nimproved appliances, such as refrigerators, may be profitably worked at\r\nthe larger establishments. The product is also of a more uniform\r\nquality. The number of farmers who adhere to hand processes is rapidly\r\ndiminishing. Formerly the average quantity of milk used per lb. of\r\nhand-made butter was about 3 gallons, but separator butter requires only\r\nabout 2.6 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Supervision.\r\n\r\nEach of the State Agricultural Departments exercises considerable\r\nsupervision in regard to the industry. Dairy experts are employed to\r\ngive instruction in approved methods of production, to examine animals,\r\nto inspect the buildings used for milking, separating and butter-making,\r\nand to examine the marketable produce. A high standard of dairy hygiene,\r\ncleanliness of _personnel_ and _materiel_ and purity of produce have\r\nalso been insisted upon under State laws. Financial assistance has been\r\ngiven to facilitate the economic handling of dairy products, and much\r\nbenefit has resulted, the advances having generally been promptly\r\nrepaid.\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of the purity and quality of Australian butter and\r\nother dairy produce, the Commerce Act passed by the Commonwealth\r\nGovernment requires that each of these articles shall conform to certain\r\nstandards. Butter intended for shipment oversea must be covered with a\r\ntrue trade description, and that the following information should appear\r\non each box:--The word \"Australia,\" the name of the State in which it\r\nwas produced, net weight, manufacturer's or exporter's name or\r\nregistered brand, and the words \"pure creamery butter,\" \"pastry butter,\"\r\n\"milled butter\" (that is, butter which is a mixture or blend of two or\r\nmore butters ordinarily packed alone and under separate names or\r\nbrands), or \"repacked butter,\" as the case may require. Other matters\r\nmay be added, but must be true, and not liable to mislead. Margarine\r\nmust be so stamped or marked. All butter and other dairy products\r\nintended for export must be sent for inspection to appointed places. The\r\ninspecting officer issues a certificate on the authorised form that it\r\nis up to the standard.\r\n\r\nThe regulations now in force contain important provisions in regard to\r\nthe standard for export dairy products. By means of these provisions\r\npurity and quality are guaranteed. Trade is also facilitated, since\r\nquantities of butter are purchased solely on the certificate issued,\r\nwithout inspection. The standard for butter, the most important dairy\r\narticle, is as follows:--Butter which contains only--No fat other than\r\nbutter fat, not more than 16 per cent. of water, 3 per cent. of casein,\r\n0.5 per cent. of boric acid, 4 per cent. of salt, or less than 82 per\r\ncent. of butter fat; or any colouring matter deemed by the Minister for\r\nTrade and Customs to be harmless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lucerne Hay.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsidiary Industries.\r\n\r\n_Pig-Raising._--Not least among the rural industries awaiting a far\r\nwider development in Australia is that of pig raising. For very many\r\nyears the number of these animals raised in the different States showed\r\nno appreciable increase, though of more recent years improvements in\r\nthis direction have been noticeable. Yet the rate of progress is quite\r\nunequal to the requirements of local demand and of the export business.\r\n\r\nPig raising for years has been a kind of subsidiary industry to\r\ndairying, and as such has seldom received the attention warranted by the\r\nreturns yielded. To some extent it has been the ease with which these\r\nprofits have been obtained that has brought about the condition of\r\naffairs existent to within a few years ago. Pig raising now, instead of\r\nbeing regarded merely as an adjunct to dairying, is being looked upon\r\nmuch in the same light as is a main line whether connected with dairying\r\nor general farming. This is indicated by the fact that where previously\r\nany description of boar or sow was good enough to produce a litter, now\r\nboth farmers and dairymen are using chiefly the pedigree stock, and are\r\ngiving attention to the different crosses most likely to give the\r\nlargest litters suitable for bacon production, which can be brought into\r\ncondition for market in the quickest time. The introduction of these\r\nbusinesslike methods has naturally resulted in greater gains, and has\r\nfurther given a stimulus to the pig-raising industry.\r\n\r\nThe policy of closer settlement which is entering freely into the rural\r\ndevelopment of the various States is furthermore causing farmers and\r\nsettlers to give more careful attention to any side industry which can\r\nbe made to return a good margin of profit on the labour expended. In\r\nother words, the modern farmer is becoming more alive to the business\r\npossibilities of what may be termed specialised production. It is in\r\nthis fact that the future development of the pig-raising industry\r\ndepends. A dairyman, general farmer, irrigationist, and even the\r\nfruitgrower finds the pig of inestimable value in using up the waste\r\nproduce, and turning it into a commodity which will return high interest\r\nin a remarkably short space of time.\r\n\r\nThis turn of events is making itself felt in other directions.\r\nBacon-curing establishments and co-operative factories are coming into\r\nexistence where formerly supplies would never have justified their\r\npresence, and the result is that those who have suitable classes of pigs\r\nto dispose of find no difficulty in turning them over at lucrative\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nThis, however, can only be regarded as a commencement in the turn of\r\naffairs, for with the increased demand and added facilities of\r\nmarketing, the sound establishment of the industry is each year becoming\r\nmore assured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. A Modern Piggery.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. Feeding pigs with corn grown on the farm.]\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the value of this side line to the settler, the\r\nexperience of a Victorian irrigated block owner, as related in the\r\ncolumns of the Melbourne \"Argus,\" is worth recording. Writing from\r\nRochester, Vic., the local correspondent reported as follows:--\"The pig\r\nindustry is becoming of great and growing importance on our irrigation\r\nholdings, and that settlers are recognising its great value as an\r\nadjunct to dairying is proved by the fact that there are now on the\r\nsettlements four times as many pigs as there were a year ago. A leading\r\nauctioneer estimates that, with improved facilities, the sales in\r\nRochester would in the near future amount to 1000 a month. The methods\r\nadopted on the irrigation farm of Messrs. Jacob and Kennedy, at\r\nNannulla, show that pig raising is a leading factor in their success.\r\nMr. Jacob demonstrated that $192 per acre a year can be realised from\r\npigs reared almost wholly on lucerne, for half an acre suffices for the\r\nsustenance of a brood sow and her progeny of about 20 per annum till\r\nthey are fit for market. Well-bred animals pay best, especially in the\r\ncase of the sire, for which a Yorkshire is recommended. Mr. Jacob is\r\nprepared to submit his books and returns to those interested, as he did\r\nto the writer.... It has to be observed that pig raising does not\r\nrequire either the capital or experience demanded in the case of sheep.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts relate in a general way to the industry as it is possible to\r\nbe carried on in all parts of the Commonwealth. A dairy man or mixed\r\nfarmer finds that the carrying on of his work at a maximum of profit\r\ninvolves the growth of a number of different crops with which to\r\nsupplement the rations of his dairy herd. Peas, barley, wheat, maize,\r\npumpkins, carrots, mangolds, lucerne, rape, and other crops are more or\r\nless used for a succession. Each one of these is of special value from\r\nthe pig-raiser's standpoint. Both peas and barley have a high value for\r\nfattening purposes, and some of the successful breeders maintain that\r\nthe addition of wheat contributes largely towards rapid development.\r\nSimilarly the root crops play an important part in the general rations,\r\nwhereas lucerne and rape make an admirable pasture for the running of\r\nstores and breeding sows. General experience has shown that when pigs\r\nwhich are being fattened for market have the run of a good pasture of\r\nthese crops they do better and fatten on much less food. Consequently\r\nwith some one or another or several of these crops to supplement the\r\nskim milk provided by the dairying operations, no more favourable\r\nconditions could well exist for the development of this adjunct to the\r\ndairying industry.\r\n\r\nWith suitable root and pasture crops there is no reason why pig raising\r\nshould remain merely as an offshoot of dairying and farming operations.\r\nIt is sufficiently remunerative even when all food has to be purchased\r\non the open market to justify attention being devoted to raising alone.\r\nBut such circumstances do not enter into the operation of the industry\r\nas managed in Australia. The close proximity of separating factories\r\nwould in many districts make it possible for a breeder to entirely\r\nignore the dairying side of the question. From these sources such\r\nsupplies of skim milk as were considered an advisable supplement to the\r\nordinary rations might easily be obtained. With only very limited\r\nsupplies of skim milk pig raising and fattening affords wide scope for\r\nthe investments of men with limited capital. F. C. Grace, of\r\nWarrnambool, Victoria, who recently went into the matter of the cost of\r\nproducing pork, indicates the possibilities of the bacon industry in a\r\nreport furnished to the State Department of Agriculture. In this account\r\nhe states:--\"Over 6 tons of live pork have been produced, and the\r\naverage cost per pound for all rations with pigs of all ages has been 4\r\ncents. The actual selling price has been 10 cents per pound, but a\r\nnumber of the pigs were sold as studs, somewhat above market price.\r\nTaking the average of all pigs sold in the open yards for bacon\r\npurposes, about 4-1/2 tons, the selling price was 10 cents per pound--a\r\nmargin of over 6 cents per pound over and above the cost of feed.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement is of interest as showing the position of the industry\r\nwhen everything has been paid for at well above market rates for the\r\nproduce, and in a degree serves to emphasise the much-improved position\r\nof the breeder who, with root crops and pasture land, is able to\r\ndispense with the costs incurred in purchasing foods for fattening\r\npurposes on the open market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Happy Family.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the Commonwealth there is a difference of opinion regarding\r\nthe relative value of the manner in which the predominating breeds, the\r\nBerkshire and Yorkshire, are crossed in raising pigs for market. This no\r\ndoubt will always exist, owing to predilection of breeders towards\r\nparticular types, and to the relative merits resulting from the various\r\ncrosses. The main point is that both breeds are wonderfully well suited\r\nto Australian conditions, and that they are prolific. Brood sows will,\r\nif kept in an ordinarily thrifty condition, farrow two litters of pigs\r\nin the year, which will number from eight to twelve pigs to the litter.\r\nIf anything, the predominating cross favours the use of the Yorkshire\r\nboar with the Berkshire sow. The cross has this advantage that the\r\nlitters will consist of all white pigs. The boar used should be pure and\r\nthe sow of good type, preferably three-quarter bred. The average litter\r\nfrom such a cross is eight. These, if kept until about five months, will\r\nweigh out at about 140 lbs., and at 12 cents per lb., the ruling price,\r\nwill return approximately $16.80 apiece, or $268.80 per year from each\r\nsow. In some instances as many as five litters may be obtained during a\r\nperiod of two years, but when this is done too much is taken out of the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect worth considering in the choice of crossing these two\r\nbreeds is that the Yorkshire sow is a better mother than the Berkshire,\r\nand the litters produced are larger. In this case there is a lack of\r\nuniformity in the colour of the litters, a fact which no doubt must\r\noften cause slight depreciation when the marketing of large numbers of\r\npigs is taken into consideration. From experience in the Commonwealth\r\nthe middle Yorkshire of a pure strain is more favoured for breeding\r\npurposes. He is a quicker grower, of hardy constitution, and as a rule a\r\nbetter shaped pig for market requirements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Typical Dairy Country.]\r\n\r\nBut while there are differences of opinion in the matter of breeds for\r\ncrossing purposes, it is clear that this subject has never been\r\nexhaustively determined. For example, while there are advocates for the\r\nmaintenance of pure strains, and the crossing of the Tamworth with both\r\nthe black and white pigs, the large white Yorkshire is practically an\r\nunknown quantity. Both in Great Britain and in Denmark this breed has\r\ndone more to establish the bacon industry than any other breed. Its\r\nvalue is indorsed by experience at Dookie College, where the only pure\r\nstrain of the breed in Victoria is located. The Berkshire sow used with\r\nthe large white boar produces a shapely offspring, which takes on the\r\nshort snout of the sow with the pure white colouring of the boar. The\r\ncross is a longer pig than the Berkshire, cleaner in the shoulder, but\r\nwith much the same conformation elsewhere. A common plan is to use all\r\nthe longest and deepest sows of the first cross for breeding baconers.\r\nThe pure large Yorkshire is not as economical as the Berkshire if\r\ngrowing pigs for the pork trade, as it takes longer to mature. The sows,\r\nhowever, average about ten to the litter, and some have fifteen or\r\nsixteen. Only the fine-haired ones seem to scald, otherwise they stand\r\nthe sun as well as the Berks. They are good doers under a wide range of\r\nconditions, prolific, vigorous, and more likely to do well under the\r\nrough circumstances to which they are accustomed on most farms than the\r\nmore delicate Berkshires. When sold at the same time as other breeds and\r\ncrosses, they always top the market; and a half-truck realised over\r\n$20.00 per head when sold in Melbourne under six months old.\r\n\r\nSo far as Australian experience has gone there is everything to indicate\r\nthat pig raising, while an extremely profitable occupation, has not yet\r\nattained the results which may be expected to follow as more attention\r\nis given to the choice of breeds, the selection of the hogs, and\r\nfecundity on the part of the sow. These are all matters which from the\r\nordinary farming standpoint have never been gone into thoroughly. That\r\npig raising will pay and does yield handsome returns is admitted, yet\r\nwhen so many avenues of improvement are open, it cannot be said that the\r\nindustry is receiving the attention it deserves. Up to the present\r\nfarmers and dairymen have been chiefly concerned with raising the pigs,\r\ndisposing of them perhaps at two months, or, as more often is the case,\r\nof keeping them on till four months, when they are topped off and sent\r\nto market to bring what can be realised. Many send away their pigs too\r\nfat, and few engaged in the general branches of agriculture really give\r\nthe animals full attention over the growing period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dam, Western Australia.]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the factories which are springing up in all the\r\nStates, this condition of things will no doubt give place to better\r\nmethods. In the first place breeders will be assured of markets for all\r\nthe pigs produced, and, secondly, the differences in values of prime\r\nbaconers will direct more attention to the greater profits for this\r\nclass of produce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A well-established Dairy Farm, New South Wales Coast.]\r\n\r\nThat there is opportunity for a great increase in pig raising is shown\r\nby the fact that Great Britain pays annually to foreign countries\r\n$91,200,000.00 for pig products. Statistics show that two great sources\r\nof supply to the British market (United States and Canada) are gradually\r\nbut surely declining, and before long must cease altogether on account\r\nof the rapid increase in population, and the consequent increased food\r\nrequirements in those countries. In Denmark we cannot expect to see any\r\ngreat increase in production, as the limit also has been nearly reached.\r\nHolland and Sweden are the only other European countries from which we\r\nmay anticipate competition. The rapid growth of the population in\r\nCentral Europe increases the food requirements of those countries, where\r\nthere is already a short supply of animal foods generally. The present\r\ncondition of the industry shows that there is a possibility of the\r\nCommonwealth building up a large export trade, even though local demands\r\nare increasing, at prices which are higher than they were ten or twelve\r\nyears ago, when the number of pigs in the Commonwealth was scarcely a\r\nthousand head more than at the present time. At the Franco-British\r\nExhibition the grand champion prize against the world was secured by\r\nAustralia for pig products in the form of frozen pork, as well as in\r\nhams and bacon.\r\n\r\n_Poultry-farming._--The fact that Australian hens and ducks have broken\r\nall records in laying competitions serves to indicate the suitability of\r\nthe country for poultry-raising. On general farms, where the birds live\r\non food that may otherwise be wasted, poultry are a source of\r\nconsiderable profit. The opinion of the Scottish Commission was that\r\n\"Australia possesses natural conditions of almost unequalled value for\r\nthe profitable keeping of poultry. In climate, soil, shelter, and in\r\nnatural food she has the essential attributes to success.\"\r\nPoultry-farming is carried on together with wheat or dairying or pig\r\nfarming, but in many places the raising of poultry is carried on as a\r\nsingle line. Poultry for consumption is extensively reared, and the\r\negg-producing qualities of the birds have also been greatly improved by\r\ncareful breeding. Egg collecting circles have been formed in some\r\ncountry districts, to develop (under Government supervision and with\r\nGovernment aid until the organisation is self-supporting) the industry\r\non co-operative lines. A member of the circle is elected to act as\r\nsecretary, and he receives all the eggs from the members, tests, packs,\r\nand forwards them to the metropolitan depot for shipment. Only clean and\r\nfresh eggs are to be delivered to the secretary under penalty of fine\r\nand expulsion from the circle. Another method of collecting and\r\nmarketing the eggs is through the local butter factories, where eggs are\r\ndelivered by the suppliers of milk and cream a number of times each\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Government Farm.--Pens at Burnley, Victoria, for\r\nEgg-laying Competition.]\r\n\r\n_Bee-farming._--Bee-farming has ordinarily been an adjunct to the\r\nagricultural or dairying industries, and can hardly yet be said to have\r\nbeen organised as a distinct industry. There are many prosperous bee\r\nfarms in the Commonwealth. The indigenous flora is rich in nectar, and\r\nthe quantities of honey stored in single hives are astonishingly large,\r\nsometimes reaching 400 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Leghorns.]\r\n\r\nWith the farmyard and dairy products of the Commonwealth standing now at\r\nover $96,000,000.00 per annum, the industry may be said to be well in\r\nits infancy.\r\n\r\nUnder the large irrigation projects being carried out in several of the\r\nStates there are splendid opportunities opening up for the carrying on\r\nof all these industries, either separately or in conjunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nShare Farming.\r\n\r\nThe system of farming on shares is common in several branches of\r\nAustralian farming, including dairying. To the intelligent and\r\nindustrious man with a limited amount of capital, the system offers many\r\nopportunities for success. Practical dairymen, and especially those with\r\nchildren over fourteen years of age, may obtain a farm on shares. The\r\narrangements made between landlords and their tenants on shares are not\r\nuniform. They differ considerably in individual cases, but the following\r\nbroad outlines of the arrangements made between the parties may be set\r\ndown as having a more or less universal application.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the landlord provides--\r\n\r\n     (a) The land cleared and fenced into convenient paddocks.\r\n     (b) The dairy herd.\r\n     (c) Cowbails and piggeries.\r\n     (d) All necessary utensils and implements.\r\n     (e) Dwelling.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the tenant supplies--\r\n\r\n     (a) All the labour--milks the cows, separates the cream and carts\r\n          it to the nearest butter factory.\r\n     (b) His own horse and cart.\r\n     (c) Cultivates sufficient land to grow green fodder for the winter.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the share farmer buys his own dairy utensils, but in\r\nthe greater number of cases the landowner provides them and keeps them\r\nin repair. The sharing of the profits depends largely upon the character\r\nof the farm. As a general rule the tenant receives from one-third to\r\none-half of the proceeds of all cream or butter sold. He also receives\r\nfrom one-third to one-half the value of the pigs raised, and from $1.20\r\nto $1.80 per head for each calf reared to the age of six months. A man\r\nis generally given as many cows to milk as he can conveniently manage\r\nand care for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Cheese Factory.]\r\n\r\nThere are cases which can be pointed to where a tenant farmer after even\r\npaying for assistance, makes a profit of from $67.20 to $96.00 every\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to state definitely the size of herd that any\r\nindividual can manage, but it is by no means uncommon to see a herd of\r\nforty head, with from twenty-five to thirty cows in milk at a time,\r\nmanaged comfortably by a man and his wife and one sturdy boy or girl of\r\nfifteen or sixteen years of age. The average returns from a fairly good\r\nherd, in the majority of districts, may be stated at $4.80 per head per\r\nmonth, and as each cow will be milking for seven to eight months at\r\nleast, and there will be the calves and ample separated milk for a good\r\nmany pigs, it will be seen that there is at least a fair living to be\r\nmade, especially when it is remembered that the share dairy farmer,\r\nunder the ordinary arrangements, is living rent free and under\r\nconditions which enable him to keep household expenses at a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe conditions regarding cropping and keeping the farm implements in\r\nrepair and caring for the dairy herd are not onerous, and are such as no\r\ngood tenant could object to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Extensive Milking Shed.]\r\n\r\nMen who contemplate undertaking this class of farming should submit the\r\nfullest possible details of their experience and qualification to enable\r\nthe officers of the Government Information Bureau to make arrangements\r\nwhich will permit of settlement immediately on arrival. It is needless\r\nto remind experienced dairymen that any owner of dairy cows naturally\r\nfeels it necessary to know a good deal about anyone to whom he is to\r\nentrust the sole management of a good herd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Young Dairy Stock.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMonetary Aid to Settlers.\r\n\r\nBesides aiding the settler in the various ways already mentioned, viz.,\r\nby providing the expert personal instruction and advice of officers of\r\nthe Agricultural Departments, in regard to feeding, breeding,\r\nmanagement, and other matters, by the importation of high-class stud\r\ncattle, and making them available at cheap rates for herd improvement,\r\nand in the granting of facilities for the transportation and marketing\r\nof his produce, the Governments of the Australian States assist the\r\ndairyman with loans of cheap money. The Advances to Settlers' Board or\r\nAgricultural Bank in each of the States, lend money to settlers for the\r\npurpose of repaying existing debts, for building homes, for purchasing\r\nstock, or for improving and developing their holdings. The sums which\r\nmay be advanced and the terms and conditions of the loans vary in\r\ndifferent States. Broadly speaking, however, a settler may obtain on the\r\nsecurity of his land or of his improvements sums ranging from $120.00 to\r\n$9600.00 at rates of interest varying from 4 per cent. to 6 per cent. on\r\neasy terms of repayment extending over a long period of years up to, as\r\nin the States of New South Wales and South Australia, thirty-one years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SOUTH WALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the coastal districts of New South Wales and throughout a vast extent\r\nof the northern and central tableland districts dairy farming is a\r\nprofitable and constantly-expanding industry.\r\n\r\nIn the older settled district of Illawarra, comprising the greater\r\nportion of the south coast district, dairying has been the main industry\r\nfor many years, and there is not much first-class land unoccupied. There\r\nis, however, in this district ample scope for tenant farmers and for\r\ndairying on shares on several large estates where the experienced man of\r\nsmall means with children old enough to help in the work can make a good\r\nliving, and save with the object of later on obtaining a farm of his\r\nown. In the north coast district the strides being made in dairying are\r\nphenomenal. There is a fair amount of first-class unimproved bush\r\ncountry available for settlement on the upper reaches of the Tweed and\r\nRichmond Rivers, and large estates have been subdivided by private\r\nowners, and offered for sale on very easy terms at from $19.20 to $28.80\r\nper acre. Many farmers who find that better returns can be obtained by\r\ncarrying a decreased number of specially good cows on a small area\r\nintensively worked are ready to dispose of areas, so that a new-comer\r\nwith capital necessary to acquire land in this highly-favoured district\r\ncan soon be suited. Owing to the big returns from dairying in the best\r\nparts of the settled portions of the north coast, land values are high,\r\nranging to over $96.00 per acre.\r\n\r\nSuitable areas of Crown lands are brought forward from time to time in\r\ndistricts adapted for dairying at prices, as a rule, lower than the\r\nlands in private subdivisions.\r\n\r\nIn the central and north coast district there are several large private\r\nsubdivisions of excellent dairy land. In the tableland districts, where\r\nthe rainfall averages 30 in. per annum, dairy farming has taken firm\r\nhold. Private owners are also cutting up tracts of splendid\r\npartially-improved land, and offering it at from $19.20 to $28.80 per\r\nacre, on liberal terms.\r\n\r\nThe natural grasses of New South Wales, especially in the well-watered\r\ndistricts along the coast, grow in great luxuriance, and are rich in\r\nmilk-producing qualities. In many districts imported grasses, such as\r\nRhodes, Paspalum dilatatum, and Philaris, rye grass and red clover have\r\nbeen introduced, and soon become well established. In the most\r\nfavourable portions of the State farmers are able to depend almost\r\nsolely on the grazing qualities of their farms, although the experts of\r\nthe Department strongly assert the wisdom of growing winter feed.\r\n\r\nNew South Wales has many fine herds of all the approved breeds. The\r\nJersey is perhaps the most popular, but there are also many good herds\r\nof Ayrshires, Guernseys, Holsteins, and other approved breeds.\r\n\r\nThe co-operative system flourishes in New South Wales. Every important\r\ncentre has its own co-operative butter, cheese or bacon factory. The\r\nByron Bay Co-operative Company, situated in the heart of the rich north\r\ncoast district, has an enormous turnover in the neighbourhood of\r\n$4,800,000.00 sterling each year, and is at least one of the largest\r\nconcerns of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Calm II.--Champion Jersey Cow.]\r\n\r\nTo stock a dairy farm of 100 acres, the detailed cost of stock and plant\r\nnecessary to make a good start, exclusive of a bull, is given by\r\npractical farmers as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                                    $\r\n     30 Cows at $31.20                                          936.00\r\n     10 Heifers, springing, at $24.00                           240.00\r\n     2 Plough Horses at $86.40                                  172.80\r\n     Harness for plough horses                                   31.20\r\n     Pigs--2 sows at $10.08; one hog at $15.60                   35.28\r\n     Separator, cans, buckets, etc.                             240.00\r\n     Cart and harness                                            86.40\r\n     Plough, $21.60; harrow, $14.40; cultivator, $12.00          48.00\r\n     Sundry tools, etc.                                          24.00\r\n                                                              --------\r\n                                                              $1813.68\r\n\r\n     Including the bull the cost might roughly be put down at $1920.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the past twenty years dairy farming in Victoria has been steadily\r\nadvancing. The industry has proved very successful, so that thousands of\r\nfarmers are not only making a comfortable living from it, but in many\r\ncases it has raised hard-working families into positions of comparative\r\nwealth. The principal markets supplied are those of Great Britain,\r\nSouth Africa, India, and the East. At present the industry is only in\r\nits infancy. It is capable of almost unlimited expansion. So far,\r\nfarmers have confined their attention almost exclusively to butter, but\r\nthe first steps have also been successfully taken to manufacture cheese\r\nand condensed milk, and to open up a regular market for fresh pork,\r\nhams, and bacon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How the Dairy Fodder Question is Settled in Australia.]\r\n\r\nA large portion of Victoria is suitable for dairy farming on account of\r\nthe suitability of soil for the production of pasture and fodder crops,\r\nand the mild climatic conditions. For the most part the cows are fed\r\nsolely on the natural pastures, little provision either in the way of\r\nfood or shelter being thought necessary. Progressive farmers, however,\r\nfind that it pays them to grow fodder for their herd and to shelter the\r\nanimals in the winter, and anyone beginning in Victoria is advised to\r\nmake up his mind to cultivate a certain area of his land from the first,\r\ninstead of trusting to grazing alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shorthorn Cattle.]\r\n\r\nThe southern half of Victoria is divided, roughly speaking, into the\r\nWestern District and Gippsland. Two-thirds of the dairy cows are kept in\r\nthese portions of the State. The Western District is famed for its rich\r\nsoil of volcanic origin. Every town and hamlet has its butter factory.\r\n\r\nGippsland is a district of rolling hills and downs, and of a\r\ncomparatively heavy rainfall. Many parts were once covered with dense\r\nforests, but these are rapidly passing away before the pioneer.\r\nPractically every railway station has become a centre of the dairying\r\nindustry, and cans of cream are always in evidence on the platforms.\r\nOwing to its suitable climate Gippsland has become the centre of maize\r\ngrowing in the State, and much of this crop reaches the market in the\r\nform of butter and pork.\r\n\r\nIn the north the summers are warmer and drier, but the soil is perhaps\r\neven more prolific than in the southern parts of Victoria. Large areas\r\nare suitable for dairy farming under ordinary conditions, and extensive\r\nwater storage works have been provided for the irrigation of large\r\ntracts of country which is being made available in suitable areas for\r\ndairying under very liberal conditions.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing and marketing of the butter is carried on, to a very\r\nlarge extent, on a co-operative basis, the factories being owned and\r\nmanaged by the farmers who supply the cream. Two hundred factories are\r\nscattered throughout the State, the largest of them producing upwards of\r\n40 tons of butter per week in the height of the season. Where the farm\r\nis close to the factory the milk is taken to the creamery, where it is\r\nseparated, and the corresponding quantity of skim milk is returned to\r\nthe farmer. In other cases the farmer owns his separator, the milk is\r\npassed through the machine as soon as the cows are milked, and the cream\r\nis sent to the factory by road or rail every day or two, according to\r\nthe size of the farm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dairy Factory--Refrigerating Butter Train.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment Assistance to the Farmer.\r\n\r\nEvery branch of the producing interests is steadily fostered by the\r\nGovernment of Victoria in a way that may sound strange to the British\r\nfarmer. Besides the facilities for acquiring farms and homes, the\r\nGovernment employs dairy supervisors, who assist the farmer with\r\ninformation and advice on matters relating to the farm and herd. The\r\nproduce is conveyed by the railways (which belong to the Government) at\r\nspecial low rates. It is received into the Government cool stores, where\r\nit is graded and frozen ready for export. The State has contracts with\r\nthe principal lines of steam-ships, securing regular despatch, a minimum\r\ntemperature, and a very low rate of freight for the British markets. It\r\ncosts less to send butter from a farm in Victoria to London than it does\r\nto send it from a farm in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Miss Prim,\" Champion Ayrshire Cow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEENSLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueensland as a Dairying Country.\r\n\r\nQueensland, especially in its southern portions and along its coastal\r\nareas, is particularly well adapted for dairying. Large areas of\r\nmagnificent soil exist, such as the Darling Downs, Lockyer, Stanley,\r\nRosewood, Fassifern, Logan, Albert, Wide Bay, Burnett, and other\r\ndistricts, which, in addition to being well watered by rivers and\r\ncreeks, enjoy a perfect winter climate. It is in these localities that\r\ndairying principally flourishes.\r\n\r\nWhile in Southern Queensland and on some of the northern tablelands it\r\nis desirable to rug milch cows during the winter months, up north, along\r\nthe eastern coastland, it is not necessary.\r\n\r\nAlong the eastern seaboard, which is well watered by running rivers and\r\ncreeks, the Blackall Range is becoming an important dairy centre. This\r\ndistrict lies to the north of Brisbane, and is a mountainous region\r\ncontaining exceedingly fertile soil.\r\n\r\nFurther north again, on the coast, there are large areas in the Burnett,\r\nGladstone, Rockhampton, and Bowen districts suitable for dairying, and\r\nin these localities it is rapidly extending. Despite this, there still\r\nremain immense tracts as yet untouched by the dairy farmer, which are\r\ncapable of being successfully brought under the Butter Industry.\r\nConsiderable portions of the northern tablelands, and parts of Central\r\nQueensland, are also suitable for dairying, and a beginning has already\r\nbeen made in these localities. Large numbers of dairy cattle are being\r\nimported into the Atherton district in the North.\r\n\r\nAs yet, only a fractional part of the country able to support a large\r\ndairying population has been touched.\r\n\r\n\r\nDairy Land and Stock.\r\n\r\nThe class of land chiefly used for dairying is open forest country,\r\nplain scrub land, and rich alluvial flats. The scrub lands have first to\r\nbe cleared by felling the scrub and burning it off when dry. When\r\ncleared, scrub soils are more prolific than any other. Cost of clearing\r\nis about $7.20 to $9.60 per acre, and in some cases more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ayrshire Dairy Cows Grazing.]\r\n\r\nThe price varies according to locality. Remoteness or proximity to\r\nmarket have to be considered. It is essential for the dairy farmer to be\r\nnear a railway. The intending settler can either select Crown lands from\r\nthe Government, at prices varying from $0.60 to $4.80 and upwards, or if\r\nhe has some capital he can purchase a freehold farm. Good dairy freehold\r\nland can be bought from $14.40 to $24.00 per acre, but close to the\r\nrailway in the older farming districts it reaches up to $96.00 per acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Ladylike,\" Ayrshire Dairy Cow.]\r\n\r\nIn ordinary times $24.00 to $38.40 is paid for a good average cow;\r\nheifers up to $21.60. Similar prices rule, generally speaking, in regard\r\nto all the States. An ordinary cow would earn from $2.40 to $4.20; and a\r\ngood cow from $4.80 to $6.00 a month, whilst in profit, on an eight\r\nmonths' average milking.\r\n\r\n\r\nDairy Breeds in Use.\r\n\r\nThe milking breeds most in use in Queensland are the Ayrshire, Jersey,\r\nand Milking Shorthorns. Herds of Holsteins, Guernseys, and other breeds\r\nhave also been established. Some fine specimens of these dairy cattle\r\nare to be seen throughout the State, and at the large annual shows of\r\npure-bred stock, held at Brisbane, Toowoomba, and other centres.\r\n\r\nThe Queensland Agricultural College, a State institution, breeds\r\nhigh-class dairy bulls for sale to farmers, and herds are being also\r\nraised on the State Farms.\r\n\r\nCows should bring in not less than $3.00 per month, or be turned out as\r\nuseless. The average is about $3.72. Up-to-date men will not keep a cow\r\nwho does not average this for her milking.\r\n\r\n\r\nCost of Starting on 160 Acres.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, varies with the circumstances of the case, and depends\r\nlargely on whether a man has the capital to push forward his operations,\r\nor is content to gradually get his land into working order. A man with\r\n$720.00 to $1032.00 could make a good start. If the land was taken up at\r\n$2.40 per acre from the Crown, his first year's deposit would be $18.24,\r\nand he would have sufficient to fence the land, buy some cows, and put\r\nup some sort of a house. Necessarily a settler does not spend much on\r\nhis house at first until he has made some money. On the other hand, many\r\nof the most prosperous farmers in Queensland have started with only a\r\nfew pounds, sufficient to pay their first year's rent. By fencing his\r\nland himself, the settler can save a good deal of expense. And by\r\nworking for neighbouring farmers, he can gradually acquire money to buy\r\nstock from time to time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if he wishes to begin straight away, and has a little\r\nmoney, he can get assistance from the Agricultural Bank, a Government\r\ninstitution, which advances $0.60 in the $ towards improvements, and\r\n$0.50 in the $ for stock, machinery, and implements, charging 5 per\r\ncent. simple interest.\r\n\r\n              COST OF STARTING A DAIRY FARM ON 160 ACRES.\r\n                                                                $\r\n     Rent--1st year's deposit and survey fee                  18.24\r\n     Fencing--2 miles at 96.00 per mile\r\n       (posts 12 feet apart and 3 barbs)                     192.00\r\n     12 Cows at $28.80 per cow                               345.60\r\n     2 Horses at $72.00                                      144.00\r\n     Plough                                                   28.80\r\n     Harness                                                  24.00\r\n     Swingle bars and chains                                   6.00\r\n     House--24 × 12 feet, slabbed and floored,\r\n       at $4.80 per foot                                     115.20\r\n     Milking-shed                                             24.00\r\n     Yard                                                     48.00\r\n     30-gallon Separator                                      60.00\r\n     Cart (second-hand)                                       24.00\r\n\r\nSome small items, such as rations, milk-room, tinware, &c., have not\r\nbeen included in the estimate. If the fencing were erected personally,\r\nthe cost would be materially reduced. If the settler built his own\r\nhouse, it would cost him little more than his own labour and the iron\r\nfor the roof.\r\n\r\nMany beginners put up cheap sapling yards for a start, and at a nominal\r\ncost. This would materially reduce this estimate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Average Herd.\r\n\r\nThe average herd is about thirty head, but many farmers milk from 80 to\r\n150 cows daily. The number of cows that could be kept on an average farm\r\nof, say, 160 acres depends entirely on the land, and the amount of\r\ncultivation or area under artificial grasses. From thirty to eighty head\r\nwould be about a fair estimate that good land would carry.\r\n\r\nOne dairy farmer in the West Moreton, who landed in Queensland\r\ntwenty-five years ago with $0.36 in his pocket, now has 160 acres of\r\nfreehold, of which he cultivates 50 acres for feed for his cows and\r\npigs. He began by working for his neighbours for the first few years,\r\nand thus gained both cash and experience. He now milks thirty to fifty\r\ncows the whole year round, and he makes from $720.00 to $864.00 a year\r\nfrom his pigs. His income from all sources is from $1920.00 to $2400.00\r\nper annum. Six or seven years ago he paid $5280.00 for the place, but\r\nto-day he would not take $14,400.00 for it, and there is not a penny of\r\ndebt on the property.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An up-to-date Milking Shed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGrasses.\r\n\r\nThe natural grasses of Queensland are sufficient in ordinary seasons\r\nduring the summer months for the dairy stock, but no farmer can\r\nsuccessfully carry on dairy operations in dry times, or in winter, by\r\nmeans of the grass alone. He requires to supplement the grass by growing\r\nfodder for the winter months.\r\n\r\nSplendid results have been obtained by sowing artificial grasses, such\r\nas Paspalum dilatatum, Rhodes, Prairie, Guinea, and Giant Couch grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter Feed.\r\n\r\nBarley, lucerne, wheat, rye, sorghum, &c., can be grown for winter feed.\r\nOn land which will grow lucerne, a certain supply of fodder can be\r\nconserved. Lucerne (or alfalfa, as it is called in America), once\r\nplanted, will last from five to ten years.\r\n\r\nThe butter factories were first started by proprietary companies, and\r\ntheir cream depots were scattered all over the farming districts.\r\nCompetition was exceedingly keen, and in some of the townships there\r\nwere four or five rival cream depots, all endeavouring to get the\r\nbiggest shares of the cream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jersey Cows.]\r\n\r\nOf late, a number of co-operative factories run by the farmers have\r\nstarted, and proved very successful, enabling their shareholders to get\r\na higher price for their cream than hitherto. They are admirably\r\nmanaged, are essentially popular institutions, and have done splendid\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe farmers establish, manage, and work them, and the profits, instead\r\nof going into the pockets of the middlemen, are distributed among the\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Aid to Co-operative Factories.\r\n\r\nUnder a vote by Parliament the State makes advances to farmers to\r\nestablish co-operative dairy factories. The loans extend over a period\r\nof fourteen years, and 4 per cent. interest is charged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCondensed Milk.\r\n\r\nThe Preserved and Condensed Milk Industry promises to become important\r\nin the near future. Six factories are now in operation.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Nestle and Co., the world-renowned firm, have invested\r\n$480,000.00 in their Preserved Milk Industry in Queensland. It speaks\r\nwell for a country when an old-world firm such as this is prepared to\r\ninvest so largely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large area of South Australia is eminently adapted to successful\r\ndairying, and while the summer is dry, rendering it necessary to make\r\nprovision for succulent feed for several months, the temperate nature of\r\nthe climate enables the dairyman to keep his cows in the open right\r\nthrough the year, the natural shelter in timber country being\r\nsufficient, except on a limited number of days of extreme wet and cold.\r\nStall feeding for weeks at a time is unknown; the necessary shelter\r\nsheds can be cheaply provided, while the labour of feeding is, under\r\nthese conditions, reduced to a minimum. In the northern districts\r\nconditions are not so favourable as in the south, but even here dairying\r\ncan be profitably carried on; the fact that land is much cheaper\r\ncompensates for the shorter period during which the natural herbage\r\nsupplies practically all the feed required. In some of the driest of our\r\nfarming areas dairying has largely replaced wheat-growing, and, although\r\nthe yield per cow is naturally not so high as under more favourable\r\nconditions, still low rents and large areas of natural pasture enable\r\nthe farmer to make a fair profit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cream Cart, North Coast, N.S.W.]\r\n\r\nThe Dairy Industry, though of considerable magnitude, has not made as\r\nmuch progress as was anticipated. This is probably due to the fact that\r\nwheat-growing and sheep-breeding combined offer greater attractions to\r\nthe farmer. These industries require a great deal less labour than\r\ndairying, besides which the work is not so continuous. So long as highly\r\nprofitable returns can be obtained from the production of cereals and\r\nthe breeding of lambs, the Dairying Industry is hardly likely to make\r\nthe progress that would otherwise be possible, though there has of late\r\nyears been steady and continued development in the industry, especially\r\nin the northern districts. In the south and south-east, where conditions\r\nare more suitable, there has, on the other hand, been very little\r\nextension.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of butter are exported to Broken Hill and West\r\nAustralia throughout the year, while during the spring months shipments\r\nare made to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nButter is exported in increasing quantities to Great Britain each year.\r\nIn normal years from 1400 to 1600 tons are shipped.\r\n\r\nCheese is not made on such an extensive scale proportionately to butter;\r\nindeed, in some seasons sufficient for local consumption is not\r\nproduced. Practically all the cheese is manufactured on the Cheddar\r\nsystem, and an article of very high quality is produced in the best\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\nSpecial facilities are afforded by the railways for the conveyance of\r\nperishable goods, and cream is forwarded by the dairyman to the city\r\nfactories from districts 300 miles distant. Payment is usually made on\r\nthe butter-fat percentages; and in order to afford suppliers an\r\nopportunity of checking the returns received from private factories the\r\nGovernment established a butter factory in connection with the export\r\nfreezing works at Port Adelaide. At this factory every can of cream is\r\nsampled, and the quantity of butter it will produce is ascertained by\r\nthe usual methods, and the supplier is paid accordingly.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of butter factories have been erected in South\r\nAustralia, and the butter produced is generally of high quality. The\r\nbutter made from the milk of cows grazing on the natural herbage of the\r\ncountry is of splendid quality and colour. Hand separators are in\r\ngeneral use, the cream being sent to the factories for treatment. The\r\npercentage of butter-fat in the milk of cows grazing on the natural\r\npastures is unusually high.\r\n\r\nPractically the whole of the midland, central, and south-east districts,\r\nexcepting that portion east of the Murray, are suitable for dairying\r\npractice when carried out on systematic lines. The prices for such land\r\nfor dairying would range from $24.00 to $240.00 per acre according to\r\nlocation, soil, and rainfall. No special terms are offered by the\r\nGovernment for the occupation of dairy lands. Most of the repurchased\r\nestates are in districts suitable for dairying, and these are allotted\r\nunder covenant to purchase. The purchase money is paid off in seventy\r\nhalf-yearly instalments (the first ten bearing interest only at the rate\r\nof 4 per cent. on purchase money). Purchase money may be completed at\r\nany time after nine years. Reliable particulars of successful dairying\r\nare difficult to obtain. It is safe to say that there are many hundreds\r\nof dairymen making comfortable livings throughout the State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fodder Crops--Lucerne, Mangels, Rape.]\r\n\r\nCapital may be safely expended for dairy practice, especially by careful\r\nand intelligent men who have families, and they may depend upon making a\r\ngood living, especially when they combine dairy practice with\r\npig-raising. There are many instances where gross returns are obtained\r\nof from $38.40 to $72.00 per cow per annum, and this in districts where\r\nthe milk is sold to the local co-operative or private factories, but\r\nwhere they are situated within forty miles of Adelaide, and are able to\r\ntake advantage of a good train service, they can deliver their milk to\r\nthe capital and obtain gross returns equal to about $76.80 to $96.00 per\r\ncow per annum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior of a Cheese Factory.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dairying Industry has not developed as rapidly as other branches of\r\nfarming in the State during recent years. The cause of this is\r\nattributable to various reasons, one of the number of which has been the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining suitable farm labourers. The majority of young\r\nmen who have embarked in farming in the Western State during the last\r\ndecade have favoured the lightly-timbered belts more suitable for wheat\r\nand sheep raising in preference to the heavily-timbered land suitable\r\nfor dairying situated in the coastal districts of the south-west. That\r\nthere is in the State an enormous area of land which is eminently\r\nadaptable to the growing of fodders necessary for successful dairying\r\nhas been amply demonstrated. Since 1905 indefatigable efforts to advance\r\nthe Dairying Industry have been made. An estate at Brunswick, in the\r\nvicinity of Bunbury, about 100 miles south of Perth, was purchased by\r\nthe Government, and 800 acres of it was vested in the Department of\r\nAgriculture for the purpose of a State Dairy Farm, on lines that could\r\nbe copied by a practical dairy farmer; also--\r\n\r\n     (1) For supplying stud stock of the best strains procurable at\r\n          reasonable prices to dairy farmers.\r\n     (2) To demonstrate that with the assistance of irrigation a small\r\n          acreage of land can be made to carry a large number of stock.\r\n     (3) Where a variety of fodder crops can be introduced, and\r\n          experimented with so as to ascertain their value for feeding-off,\r\n          both in a green state for curing into hay or for preserving into\r\n          big silos in a succulent form.\r\n\r\nCapacious cow and calf stables, suitable sheds, and piggeries were\r\ndesigned and constructed as an example to be followed in starting an\r\nup-to-date dairy farm. A herd of dairy cows, of some of the best\r\nAyrshire strains in Australia, was collected, as well as a fine number\r\nof Berkshire pigs, purchased from the most successful breeders and\r\nimporters. Three large tub silos, capable of holding 250 tons of fodder,\r\nwere erected in which to store winter-grown crops as well as the summer\r\ncrops under irrigation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Crown Prince,\" Guernsey Bull.]\r\n\r\nAn irrigation scheme was carried out, and the results have been most\r\nsuccessful. The following dairy fodder crops have yielded\r\nprolifically:--Oats, rye, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, vetches, field\r\npeas, cow peas, lucerne, mustard, Jersey kale, field cabbage, turnips,\r\nswedes, mangel wurzel, silver beet, buckwheat, potatoes, linseed, pig\r\nmelon, paspalum, Italian canary grass. The irrigation plant is capable\r\nof dealing with 80 acres of land in the summer months. Some of the land\r\nthus treated is the rich dark alluvial on the river bank, while a\r\nportion is on the higher clay plateau, and consists of land typical of\r\nmany thousands of acres in the same locality. The land in its virgin\r\nstate was timbered with red gum and flooded gum, and cost about $38.40\r\nan acre to grub and clear, and on such land with irrigation in the\r\nsummer two heavy crops a year can be depended on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Milking Shed.]\r\n\r\nShortly after the State Farm was established the Government purchased\r\nover 500 dairy cows in the eastern States, and these were sold to\r\nWestern Australian farmers in lots of ten at cost price on two-year\r\nterms, with 5 per cent. interest added.\r\n\r\nThe Government engaged a highly-qualified dairy expert in the person of\r\nMr. Kinsella, of New Zealand, to visit the districts most likely to give\r\nattention to the dairying industry in the immediate future, and by means\r\nof personal interviews, addresses, leaflets, and concisely-written\r\npamphlets, Mr. Kinsella did valuable work in distributing information\r\nand directing the beginner on the right road to successful dairying. Mr.\r\nKinsella subsequently severed his connection with the department, and he\r\nhas been recently succeeded by Mr. Abernethy, who has obtained the very\r\nhighest diplomas in England in connection with dairying. Mr. Abernethy\r\nrecently arrived from Great Britain, and has now entered upon his\r\nduties, and it is confidently believed that his efforts will result in a\r\nnumber of farmers being induced to embark in the industry on sound and\r\npractical lines. The new selector will also have the benefit and the\r\nadvice of the Director of Agriculture, Mr. McNulty, on all matters\r\nconcerning his soil, his stock, and the marketing of his produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nLands for Dairy Farming.\r\n\r\nWith a view to settling practical farmers with limited means on the rich\r\nand heavily-timbered lands in the southern portion of the State the\r\nGovernment have a large number of surveyors at work surveying the land\r\ninto suitable sized blocks, ranging from 200 to 700 acres each. Main\r\nroads have been cleared to serve these areas, and a proposal to clear 10\r\nacres on each block for the plough is now under consideration. Railways\r\nwill be pushed through this country as rapidly as possible. The annual\r\naverage rainfall over this country averages from 35 in. to 40 in., and\r\nthe land contains some of the richest soil in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrice of Land.\r\n\r\nThe price of land ranges from about $4.80 to $19.20 an acre, and each\r\nnew selector over sixteen years of age will have the right to\r\npractically a free grant of 160 acres, additional land being available\r\nat approximately the prices quoted, the payments for which will be\r\nspread over twenty years without interest. The selector will also have\r\nthe privilege of borrowing from the State Agricultural Bank for\r\nringbarking, clearing, water conservation, and subsequently for stock\r\nand implements, the loan being repaid over a term of thirty years, for\r\nthe first five years of which interest only at the rate of 5 per cent.\r\nper annum will be payable. Prior to the blocks being thrown open the\r\nprices will be advertised and the amount of loan the bank is prepared to\r\nadvance to suitable applicants on each block will be fixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Devon Cattle in Australia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prime Herd of Jerseys.]\r\n\r\n\r\nButter Factories.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there are three butter factories operating in the\r\nState, and no doubt when the Dairying Industry has developed\r\nsufficiently a number of co-operative factories will be started.\r\n\r\nThe men who decide to devote their energies to the Dairying Industry\r\nwill have the advantage of a magnificent local market to start on, as at\r\nthe present time Western Australia is sending something like $4800.00 a\r\nday to the eastern States for dairy produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTASMANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conditions of Tasmania are eminently favourable for dairy farming.\r\nUp till recent years the industry did not receive much attention, but\r\nnow that a start has been made butter production is advancing rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Land Required.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Dairying Industry is grass, and to get grass, good\r\nland and plenty of moisture is required. Therefore anyone proposing to\r\ngo into this business should endeavour to secure the very best land\r\nobtainable. There is a large quantity available, especially in the\r\nnorth-western and north-eastern parts of the island. There is a great\r\ndeal also in the southern districts. Information can always be obtained\r\nfrom the Lands Department and the district surveyors, and no difficulty\r\nshould be experienced by the intending dairy farmer in finding land\r\nsuitable for his purpose. The more open parts of the State, such as the\r\nmidlands and the east coast, where there is natural grass, have largely\r\npassed into private hands, and later selectors have had to take up,\r\nclear, and lay down in pasture the more heavily-timbered portions. This,\r\nhowever, is not altogether the handicap it appears at first sight, as\r\nthe returns from the very rich scrub lands are by far the highest. It is\r\neasy to judge of the quality of land by the indigenous timber upon it.\r\nRich land, suitable for laying down in grass, is covered with a dense\r\ngrowth of sassafras, tree-fern, musk, and pear tree, with large blue or\r\nswamp gums, and an underbush of what are known as cathead ferns.\r\nStringy-bark trees mean a poorer soil, and any land bearing them should\r\nbe avoided if possible.\r\n\r\nAny person of eighteen years of age and upwards may select an area not\r\nexceeding 200 acres of first-class land, provided he does not hold land\r\non credit under any previous Act. He is required to pay a cash deposit\r\nof $0.04 an acre at the time of sale, an instalment of $0.06 an acre for\r\neach of the two following years, $0.24 an acre annually for the next\r\nfour years, $0.36 an acre for the next four years, and $0.48 per acre\r\nfor the next eight years. The survey fee is paid, one-fifth in cash and\r\nthe balance by four equal annual payments, with interest added, unless\r\nthe selector elects to pay it off at once, when interest is remitted.\r\nEvery encouragement short of giving the fee simple of the land away for\r\nnothing is afforded the intending settler, and he can acquire a freehold\r\non easier terms in Tasmania than anywhere else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ayrshire Herd, New South Wales.]\r\n\r\n\r\nClearing the Land.\r\n\r\nClearing a selection for dairy farming is a very different operation\r\nfrom the clearing required for fruit-growing. Where the land is to be\r\nlaid down in pasture, no ploughing has to be done, consequently the\r\ncost is very much less. In clearing land for grass it is the best plan\r\nto first of all \"ring\" all the eucalyptus trees. This consists in\r\ncutting a ring round the tree with axes through the bark and sapwood, or\r\nalburnum, into the brown wood beneath. The crude sap, bearing in\r\nsolution the various organic matters which the roots have extracted from\r\nthe soil, ascends by the outer layer of wood immediately beneath the\r\nbark to the leaves, where it is elaborated into plant food. When this\r\nlayer is cut through, the food supply is immediately stopped, and the\r\ntree dies. The operation of ringing is best done during the winter, when\r\nthe sap is down, and if properly performed at the right time the tree\r\nalways dies very soon. If possible, the ringing should be done a year or\r\ntwo before the general clearing is commenced, as all the dead leaves,\r\nsmall branches, and dead bark have time to fall, and are then burned off\r\nwith the rest of the scrub. The next operation is to cut down all the\r\nbrushwood and smaller growths with bill-hooks, and then the rest of the\r\nscrub is felled with axes, and allowed to lie until quite dry, when it\r\nis burned off. A good burn should leave very little to be cleared up,\r\nbut sometimes, where there is such vegetation as sassafras or fallen\r\ntree-ferns, a good deal of \"picking-up\" has to be done. This means that\r\nall the unburnt timber on the ground has to be rolled together and\r\nburnt. Tree-ferns should not be felled, as they do not burn well. The\r\nbest way of killing them is to cut off the fronds just below where they\r\nspring from the stem. Some knack is required to cut in just the right\r\nplace, but it is easily acquired. There are certain precautions to be\r\nobserved in burning-off, which the settler should make himself\r\nacquainted with. Information on this point and in regard to any matters\r\nof practical interest to the beginner will be furnished gladly and\r\nwithout charge by experienced officers of the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clearing the Land.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the land is burnt off the grass may be sown upon it. No\r\ncultivation is usually given, the grass-seed being sown upon the ashes\r\nremaining from the burnt scrub, which forms very effective manure.\r\nCocksfoot is the grass par excellence for this work, as it is very hardy\r\nand nutritious, and not attacked by insect pests to the same extent as\r\nothers. Sometimes a mixture of cocksfoot, English rye-grass, and white\r\nclover is used, or the two grasses alone are planted. Local information\r\nis the best guide obtainable as to what it is best to plant. Dairying\r\nthus becomes practicable in a year or two, and returns are received much\r\nsooner than from any other branch of agriculture. It will, of course, be\r\nnecessary to clear a certain amount of the selection for cultivation, so\r\nthat crops may be grown, and it is often better and cheaper in the end\r\nto devote the poorer and less heavily timbered parts of the holding to\r\nthis purpose, and buy manure. Some selectors clean up a part of the\r\nground of roots and logs, leaving all the big ringed timber standing,\r\nand plough it up. It requires some skill to steer a plough under these\r\nconditions, but very good crops can be grown in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nButter Factories.\r\n\r\nProperly equipped butter factories are situated at Launceston (2),\r\nDeloraine, Burnie, Emu Bay, Wynyard, Stanley, Smithton, Wilmot,\r\nRingarooma, Derby, and Pyengana. In the south there are only two of any\r\nmagnitude, one in Hobart, and the other at Bream Creek. A well-equipped\r\nfactory has been established on King Island, in Bass Straits, a locality\r\nthat has been found very suitable for dairying.\r\n\r\n\r\nDairy Herds.\r\n\r\nThe dairy herds of the State until a few years ago were of a somewhat\r\nnondescript type, very few farmers having realised the necessity of\r\nimproving the butter-yielding capacity of their stock. Recently,\r\nhowever, great improvements have taken place, as the dairying industry\r\nhas advanced, until now many Tasmanian dairymen own herds of the highest\r\nstandard. The work of improving the milking strains of cattle is in the\r\nhands of the farmers themselves, but advice and assistance are always\r\nobtainable from the Government Dairy Expert.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheese-making.\r\n\r\nThis is a highly profitable branch of dairy farming, and the product is\r\nso small in bulk compared with its value that it is eminently portable.\r\nCheese-making can therefore be carried on under conditions where other\r\nforms of production would be difficult. Some skill and knowledge are\r\nrequired, but the Dairy Expert regularly gives lectures and\r\ndemonstrations on the subject in all the principal agricultural centres,\r\nso that any intelligent person can easily obtain all the information he\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nThe principal cheese factories in the State are situated at St. Mary's,\r\nPyengana, Emu Bay, Devonport, and Circular Head.\r\n\r\nThe cheese produced is very good in quality, and a considerable export\r\ntrade will soon be developed in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacon-curing.\r\n\r\nThe production of hams and bacon is one of the collateral industries\r\nconnected with dairying, as the skim-milk and waste products form a very\r\nvaluable food for fattening pigs. Excellent bacon is produced in\r\nTasmania, and a good deal is exported, but not nearly what might be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Group of Prize Bulls.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDairy Factories.\r\n\r\nIt is the introduction of the dairy factory system that has solved the\r\nproblem of success or failure for the dairy farmer. These institutions\r\nare becoming fairly numerous throughout the State, and are all equipped\r\nwith the most modern machinery and managed by expert men. The farmer\r\nnearly always, nowadays, has his cream separator, and all he has to take\r\nto the factory is the cream, which does not occupy much space, while the\r\nskimmed milk remains on the farm for feeding pigs or calves. Some of the\r\ndairy factories in the State are proprietary, but others are on the\r\nco-operative system, under which the farmers are the owners, and share\r\nin the general profits, as well as being paid for their cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCARRON, BIRD & CO., Printers, 479 Collins Street, Melbourne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The personnel of the Commission was as follows:--Sir T.\r\nCarlaw Martin, Edinburgh (Chairman); Sir John R.
