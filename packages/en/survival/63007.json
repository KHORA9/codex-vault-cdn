They are not picked\r\nseparately, but in spikes or bunches, and are then placed on mats to\r\ndry. At night the berries are placed under cover.\r\n\r\nThe average yield per vine is eight to ten pounds each year.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of Black Pepper derive their name from the\r\nlocalities in which they are grown or the ports whence they are shipped,\r\nas Singapore, Lampong, Sumatra, Tellicherry, Acheen, Malabar, Trang,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              White Pepper\r\n\r\nThis is obtained by decorticating or removing the skin from the fully\r\nripened black peppercorns—accomplished by maceration.\r\n\r\nWhite Whole Pepper grains are grayish white. They are more nearly\r\nspherical in shape than the Black Pepper berries, and have light-colored\r\nlines running from top to bottom. The more common varieties are known as\r\nSiam, Singapore and Penang.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Red Pepper\r\n\r\nThe U. S. Standards describe Red Pepper as the dried ripe fruit of any\r\nspecies of capsicum, a genus of the _nightshade family_ indigenous to\r\nthe American tropics. It is now cultivated in nearly all warm and\r\ntemperate countries, both commercially and in the kitchen-garden. The\r\nleading commercial varieties are Zanzibar, Africa, Indias, and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Paprika\r\n\r\nPaprika is botanically described as _Capsicum annuum_. The pods are\r\nlarge and brilliant to dark red. It grows in the temperate and torrid\r\nzones. It is cultivated principally in Spain (_Pimiinton_) and Hungary.\r\nThe Spanish-grown product is sweet and mild, the Hungarian usually of a\r\nmildly pungent flavor. Paprika is used in cooking for its color as well\r\nas flavor. It is rapidly finding favor among American housewives.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Cinnamon or Cassia)]\r\n\r\n  Ceylon Cinnamon\r\n  Batavia Cinnamon\r\n  Chinese Cassia (Cinnamon)\r\n  Saigon Rolls\r\n  China Cassia Rolls\r\n  Cassia Buds\r\n    Buds Natural size, all others ½ Natural size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Cassia and Cinnamon\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terms Cassia and Cinnamon, although they represent two separate\r\nspecies of the genus _Cinnamomum_ belonging to the Laurel family, in\r\ncommerce are interchangeable.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A Corner of One of the Warerooms]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Cinnamon\r\n\r\nIs the thin, inner bark of the tree, of a pale yellowish brown color,\r\nand is found on the market in long, quill-like rolls, the smaller rolls\r\nbeing incased in the larger. The small dark spots on the outer surface\r\ncorrespond to points where the leaves were attached to the stem.\r\n\r\nTrue Cinnamon is native to the Island of Ceylon, but is cultivated in\r\ntropical Asia, Sumatra and Java. The yield of Ceylon Cinnamon is\r\nrelatively small. Its use in the United States is limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Cassia\r\n\r\nThe ordinary commercial Cassia is the bark of the _Cinnamomum Cassia_,\r\nwhich comes from China, Japan, Indo-China and India. It is usually\r\ndarker in color than true Cinnamon, rougher, and about four times as\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nCinnamon and Cassia range in value according to type and quality,\r\nalthough much depends on actual flavoring strength. They are chiefly\r\nvalued in the order named—Saigon, Batavia or Java and China.\r\n\r\nThose desiring a pure Ceylon Cinnamon can secure it from McCormick &\r\nCompany of Baltimore, Importers and Grinders of Spices. Choicest Cassia,\r\nin rolls or ground, is put up under their Bee Brand and Banquet Brand\r\nTrade Marks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bee Brand Select Stick Cinnamon]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Mace or Nutmeg)]\r\n\r\n  Mace\r\n  Nutmeg Plant\r\n  Green Fruit\r\n  Macassar\r\n  Nutmeg\r\n  Cross section of Fruit\r\n  Ripe Fruit in act of bursting\r\n  Nutmeg, in shell\r\n  Shell partly removed\r\n  Cross section of Nutmeg\r\n  Penang Nutmegs\r\n    ½ Natural size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Nutmegs and Mace\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nutmeg-tree, genus _Myristica_ (natural order _Myristicaceæ_),\r\nnative of the Malay Archipelago, usually grows to a height of twenty to\r\nthirty feet. While the greater part of the world’s supply of both\r\nNutmegs and Mace comes from the Banda Islands, the West Indies are by no\r\nmeans to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Nutmeg fruit is about three inches long and about two inches in\r\ndiameter. It includes, first, the outer or fleshy membranous part;\r\nsecond, the substance covering the outer shell of the Nutmeg, known as\r\nMace, next the shell, and finally the kernel or commercial Nutmeg.\r\n\r\nAfter harvesting, which in some places is done with long forked sticks\r\nor bamboo poles, the red colored network (Mace) is removed and the nuts\r\nare placed over a fire in mesh bottom receptacles, where they remain for\r\nperhaps a month, being kept about ten feet away from the flames. They\r\nare next exposed to the sun for two or three hours daily for several\r\ndays, or until the kernels rattle within the shell. They are then\r\nremoved from the shell and assorted into three general grades.\r\n\r\nAmong the many varieties of Nutmegs the Singapore, Penang, West Indian\r\nand Macassars are most esteemed, the price being regulated by the type,\r\nsize and quality of the nut.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years ground Nutmeg has been placed on the market\r\nand is steadily finding favor with American housewives.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: McCormick’s Bee Brand Pepper]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Mace\r\n\r\nMace is carefully removed from the shell surrounding the kernel of the\r\nNutmeg by hand, although a knife is sometimes employed. It is then\r\nplaced on mats or trays to dry in the sunshine. Of late years, however,\r\nartificial drying has proven so successful that it is rapidly\r\nsupplanting the old method in which the sunshine dissipated some of the\r\nvirtues of the Mace. Several months are required to cure it. During this\r\ntime it changes from a crimson to a blood red and later to the yellowish\r\nor golden brown color, in which state it is found on the market here.\r\n\r\nThe Penang or Banda Mace is probably the most desirable, with the Siauw\r\nand Batavia following in the order named.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be exercised in the grinding of Mace, as it is very rich\r\nin volatile oil. Bee Brand Ground Mace is prepared in mills especially\r\ndesigned for the purpose. Nutmegs and Mace imported by McCormick &\r\nCompany are marketed as Bee and Banquet Brands.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Ginger)]\r\n\r\n  Ginger Plant, Flower and Root\r\n  African Ginger Root\r\n  Jamaica\r\n  Japan\r\n    ⅔ Natural size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Ginger\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the Spices treated in this series, Ginger is the root-stock of a\r\nplant known botanically as _Zingiber officinale_, an annual herb, three\r\nor four feet high. It is a native of India and China, but is grown\r\nextensively in tropical America, Africa and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe plant endures a wide range of climate. It may be grown at sea level\r\nor in mountainous regions, provided the rainfall be abundant or\r\nirrigation adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is found cultivated from the Himalaya Mountains, 5000 feet above sea\r\nlevel, to Cape Comarin.\r\n\r\nThe root is dug when the plant is a year old and after the stalk has\r\nwithered.\r\n\r\nBlack Ginger, of which Calcutta and African are the common varieties, is\r\nproduced by scalding the freshly dug roots. This prevents sprouting.\r\n\r\nWhite Ginger is the decorticated product, the chief varieties being\r\nJamaica, Cochin and Japan. Jamaica is the most esteemed. Jamaica Ginger\r\nis best known and most used here, although both Cochin and African\r\nGinger are imported in a large way.\r\n\r\nThe different varieties of Ginger are imported by McCormick & Company,\r\nwho distribute them under the Bee Brand and Banquet Brand guarantee.\r\nGreen Ginger is the undried root. That received in the United States is\r\nthe Jamaica variety.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: McCormick’s Bee Brand Ground Ginger]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Mrs. King’s Bee Brand Ginger Bread\r\n\r\n  1 cup brown sugar\r\n  1 cup Porto Rico molasses\r\n  1 cup sour milk\r\n  1 (rounded) teaspoon soda in 2 tablespoons boiling water\r\n  1 cup boiling water\r\n  2 teaspoons Bee Brand Powdered Ginger\r\n  2 eggs and 3 cups flour\r\n  1 teaspoon Bee Brand Powdered Cinnamon\r\n  ½ teaspoon Bee Brand Nutmeg\r\n  2 tablespoons lard\r\n  2 tablespoons butter\r\n  ⅛ teaspoon salt\r\n  1 teaspoon baking powder\r\n  1 tablespoon baking powder\r\n\r\nMix and sift dry ingredients.

Add a cup of currants if desired.—_From Bee\r\nBrand Manual of Cookery._\r\n\r\nThe mixture should be the consistency of Muffin Batter, add a little\r\nmore flour, if necessary.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Pimento or Allspice)]\r\n\r\n  Jamaica Fruit\r\n  Mexican\r\n  Flower\r\n    ⅔ Natural size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Pimento, or Allspice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pimento (_Pimenta officinalis_), an evergreen tree belonging to the\r\nMyrtle family, is a native of the West Indies, but is found in Mexico,\r\nCosta Rica and Venezuela as well. The highest quality Pimento comes from\r\nthe Island of Jamaica. The Mexican berry, while handsome in appearance,\r\nis inferior in flavoring quality.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Packeting Spices]\r\n\r\nThe trees usually grow in groups of from five to twenty, but are\r\nsometimes found in forests. After the tree has attained a certain\r\ngrowth, the underbrush and other Pimentos are cut away, leaving the\r\ntrees about twenty-five feet apart.\r\n\r\nThe Pimento flowers twice each year, but bears only one crop of berries.\r\n\r\nThe problem of harvesting is the most serious with which the planter has\r\nto contend. It is difficult to secure help among the indolent natives,\r\nand as the harvest season is short—because the berries must be picked\r\njust before they ripen—the loss from over-ripening is very great. After\r\nharvesting, the berries are exposed daily to the sun for a period of\r\nfrom seven to twelve days, being placed under cover each night.\r\n\r\nPimento, or Allspice, as it is generally known, is exported principally\r\nfrom Kingston, Jamaica, in 120 to 130 lb. bags, about one-third of the\r\ncrop coming to the United States, while the remainder finds its way to\r\nEngland, whence it is exported to other countries.\r\n\r\nAs its common name implies, Allspice has a flavor which is suggestive of\r\nthe combined flavors of many spices.\r\n\r\nMcCormick & Company import only the choicest Allspice grown and market\r\nit under their Bee Brand and Banquet Brand trade marks. It may be had\r\neither ground or whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Waldorf Salad\r\n\r\n  2 cups diced tart apples\r\n  2 cups diced celery\r\n  1 cup English walnuts, chopped\r\n\r\nMix and pour over all mayonnaise dressing.

The Clove-tree is cultivated\r\nin Ceylon, India, Mauritius, the West Indies and Zanzibar. The different\r\nvarieties derive their names from the district of origin or the city of\r\nexportation. Cloves from Amboyna, Penang and Zanzibar are perhaps best\r\nknown and are in greatest demand.\r\n\r\nThe flowers grow in clusters. The green buds change to a reddish hue, at\r\nwhich stage they are removed from the tree, spread in the sun and\r\nallowed to dry. When allowed to fully fruit, the bud develops into a\r\nhard seed an inch long, with a pulpy cover. This is called Mother of\r\nCloves.\r\n\r\nThe tree yields only one crop a year, the yield under normal conditions\r\nbeing about 300 pounds to the acre. The average consumption is estimated\r\nat 11,000,000 pounds per year.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of varieties of Cloves resembling each other in\r\nappearance, but vastly different in pungency and flavoring value.\r\n\r\nThe slender stems bearing the closed buds have, to a limited degree, the\r\naromatic clove flavor, and as they sell for a very small fraction of the\r\ncost of Cloves, are frequently powdered and used for reducing the cost\r\nof Powdered Cloves, at the expense of quality and of common honesty.\r\n\r\nMcCormick & Company do not import, buy or sell Clove stems. Their Bee\r\nand Banquet Brands Cloves, whole or ground, are carefully selected for\r\nsuperior quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PRATT INSTITUTE\r\n                             BROOKLYN, N.Y.\r\n                  SCHOOL OF HOUSEHOLD SCIENCE AND ARTS\r\n                      Isabel Ely Lord, _Director_\r\n\r\n                                                           May 22, 1913.\r\n\r\nMr. W.

The report is that no one of the flavorings\r\nand spices was found unsatisfactory, and that the Orange Tipped Pekoe\r\nTea was especially praised. We shall be very glad to know if you put\r\nyour products on sale in New York, as in that case we shall certainly\r\nuse them.\r\n                           Yours very truly,\r\n                                                        Isabel Ely Lord.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Herbs)]\r\n\r\n  Marjoram\r\n  Sage\r\n  Caraway\r\n  Caraway Cross section Fruit\r\n  Tender Sage Leaves\r\n  Manioc or Cassava\r\n  Fruit\r\n  Yellow Mustard\r\n  Pearl Tapioca\r\n  Pod\r\n  English\r\n  Granulated Tapioca\r\n  German\r\n  Cross section Cardamon Seed\r\n  Brown Mustard\r\n  German\r\n  Bari\r\n  Pod\r\n  Cardamon\r\n  Seed\r\n    Plants—½ Natural size—fruit—Natural size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Seed, Herbs, Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Caraway\r\n\r\nThe Seed of the _Carum Carui_ is indigenous to Northern Europe and\r\ncultivated to some extent in the United States. The seed is used as a\r\nflavor in the preparation of many foods.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bee Brand Rubbed Sage]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Cardamom\r\n\r\nCommonly spelled Cardamon. The Cardamoms of Java, Ceylon and Madagascar\r\nare much alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Tapioca\r\n\r\nThe product of the roots or tubers of the Manioc or Cassava is known as\r\nTapioca. The plant is native to Brazil, but is cultivated in Jamaica and\r\nthe Far East. There are two kinds of Tapioca—Pearl and Granulated. Both\r\nare made from the same rootstock under a slightly different process.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Marjoram\r\n\r\nThe leaf of a shrubby plant, a genus of the Mint family, native to the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean; usually called Sweet Marjoram.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Mustard\r\n\r\nMustard-Seed comes from Russia, Germany, England and Holland, and to\r\nsome extent from California. There are two chief divisions, yellow and\r\nbrown. The brown seed comes largely from Italy and is known as Bari. The\r\nterm Trieste is frequently applied to all brown Mustard-Seeds.\r\n\r\nMustard-Seed contains two oils, known as Essential and Fatty. The\r\nEssential Oil is soluble in water. In flavor and odor it closely\r\nresembles horseradish. The Fatty Oil is mild and tasteless, insoluble in\r\nwater, and is sometimes used in place of olive oil.\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing Mustard-Flour the seed is warmed, subjected to\r\nhydraulic pressure, which releases from fifteen to twenty-five per cent\r\nof the fatty oil. The residue is called Mustard-Cake. It is ground and\r\nbolted on fine sieves, separating the Mustard bran or hulls from the\r\ninterior, making ground mustard or flour. Brown seed contains a larger\r\npercentage of the essential oil, and, therefore, makes a hotter or\r\nstronger flour than the yellow variety, and must be blended with flour\r\nfrom yellow seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Sage\r\n\r\nA perennial shrub about two feet high, native to Southern Europe, but\r\ncultivated in this country as a garden plant. Bee Brand Rubbed Sage is\r\nthe finest Sage imported. It is rubbed and ready for use.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Vanilla)]\r\n\r\n  Aerial Root of Vanilla\r\n  Vanilla Bean\r\n  Green Bean\r\n    ⅔ Natural size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Vanilla-Bean\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla-Bean is the fruit of the _Vanilla planifolia_ or flat-leaved\r\nVanilla vine and is the source from which pure or true Vanilla Extract\r\nis made. This climbing perennial belongs to the Orchid family and is\r\nindigenous to Central and South America, but reaches its perfection of\r\nflavor in Mexico. The Mexican bean sometimes attains a length of ten\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: One of the Extract Stills]\r\n\r\nWhen gathered, the beans are yellowish green, fleshy and without odor.\r\nTheir color and odor is developed by a process of fermentation or\r\nsweating, which differs in various countries. The best method consists\r\nof sun-drying for about a month, the beans being pressed alternately\r\nbetween the folds of blankets and exposed to the air. After curing they\r\nare tied in bundles. Vanilla-Beans when cured exude and become covered\r\nwith fine frostlike crystals of vanillin, the important active flavoring\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nNext in value to the Mexican bean comes the Bourbon, which term is\r\napplied to all the Vanilla-Beans grown in the islands of the Indian\r\nOcean, off the east coast of Africa, of which Madagascar, Réunion, the\r\nComores, Mauritius and the Seychelles are most important. These beans\r\nare shorter than the Mexican, decidedly inferior in flavoring quality,\r\nand, therefore, less expensive. They more nearly resemble the Tonka bean\r\nin odor. The cheapest beans are the Tahitis and so-called vanillons or\r\nbeans of the wild Vanilla (_Vanilla pompona_). They are little used in\r\nextract making, and properly so, as they have neither strength nor\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nThe Tonka bean is here mentioned simply because it is so largely used in\r\nthe manufacture of imitation Vanilla Extracts. It is the seed of the\r\n_Dipterix odorata_, native to Guiana. The pod is almond shaped and\r\ncontains a single seed shaped like a kidney-bean. This bean is dark in\r\ncolor, having a thin, shiny, brittle skin, containing a two-lobed oily\r\nkernel. A hundred years ago these beans were found in the snuffbox of\r\nevery gentleman and in the handkerchief case of every lady.\r\n\r\nFurther information regarding the Vanilla-Bean may be found under\r\nFlavoring Extracts on page 22.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Tea)]\r\n\r\n  Chinese Tea Plant and Flowers\r\n  Chinese Tea Leaf\r\n  Japanese Tea Leaf\r\n  Ceylon Tea Leaf\r\n  India Tea Leaf\r\n  Seeds\r\n    Natural size\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Tea\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial tea is the prepared leaf or leaf-bud of an evergreen,\r\nindigenous to Asia, which in its wild state attains the general\r\nproportions of the American peach-tree. Botanically, it is known as\r\n_Camellis Thea_ or _Thea Chinensis_. Under cultivation, it is kept\r\npruned to within three to five feet high. The constant pruning\r\nencourages the growth of new branches and new leaves. The value of the\r\nTea is in the young tender leaf.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Testing Tea]\r\n\r\nTeas are divided into two groups, which differ chiefly in the method of\r\ncuring. A tea-plant may produce a leaf which commercially may be either\r\nblack or green, depending on the treatment.\r\n\r\nGreen tea is prepared by steaming the fresh green leaf and then drying\r\nit. In this way the bright color is preserved.\r\n\r\nBlack Tea is the result of oxidization or fermentation, caused by\r\nexposing the leaves to the sun, which turns them black.\r\n\r\nThe best Teas are made from the young leaves, the different varieties\r\nbeing graded according to their age and position on the shoot.\r\n\r\nTea is produced in large quantities in China, Japan, India and the\r\nislands of Ceylon, Java and Formosa.\r\n\r\nThere are about 200 varieties of Teas, and, perhaps, ten times as many\r\nflavors. Tea ranges in value from a few cents per pound for stems up to\r\n$10.00 for the very finest leaf.\r\n\r\nThe Government inspects all teas entering the United States, and those\r\nbelow a certain standard are not allowed to enter the country.\r\n\r\nTea drinking in the United States is increasing, but the consumption is\r\nstill far behind that of many other countries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Banquet Extra Fancy Blended Tea]\r\n\r\nThe average American housewife has not given to the brewing of tea the\r\nsame careful consideration she gives to the preparation of other\r\nbeverages. Good Tea brewed right is a delicious beverage, but certain\r\nrules must be observed.\r\n\r\nComplete directions for the perfect brewing of Tea appear on each\r\npackage of Banquet Brand. Under this brand all the desirable varieties\r\nare packed as well as a remarkable blend.\r\n\r\nOur publication, “Tea, Its Early History, and the Three Colonial\r\nAmerican Tea Parties,” will be mailed free upon request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Flavoring Extracts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States Agricultural Department, Circular No. 19, contains the\r\nstandards for foods. Among these are standards for Flavoring Extracts.\r\nBy this regulation Extract of Lemon must contain at least 6.4 ounces of\r\nOil of Lemon to 1 gallon of finished product, or, as the circular puts\r\nit, 5 per cent Oil of Lemon by volume, and Vanilla Extract the\r\nextractive matter from at least 13.35 ounces of the bean to the gallon\r\nof finished product. The flavor is extracted from the bean by a mixture\r\nof alcohol and water, as the resins in the Vanilla-Bean will not impart\r\ntheir flavor to alcohol alone or to water alone, but to a mixture\r\ncontaining from 40 to 60 per cent of alcohol, according to character of\r\nbean. Long experience is required to accomplish the results desired.\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla-Beans brought into this country range in price about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Mexican, $3.50 to $6.00 per pound.\r\n  Bourbon, $3.00 to $5.50 per pound.\r\n  Guadalupe, $3.00 to $5.50 per pound.\r\n  Seychelles, $3.25 to $4.50 per pound.\r\n  Tahiti, $1.75 to $2.50 per pound.\r\n\r\nAnd a large variety, such as Java, South American and others, ranging in\r\nprice from $2.75 to $5.00 per pound.\r\n\r\nThese prices represent wholesale prices and vary from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe use of Tahiti Beans, coming from the Islands of Tahiti, has grown\r\nvery largely in the last few years. They are much used by manufacturers\r\nmaking the cheaper extracts.\r\n\r\nThe Vanilla-Bean dries out very quickly, but if properly cared for and\r\nprotected does not lose its strength. In fact, the flavor greatly\r\nimproves with age.\r\n\r\nThe same beans can be treated for extract by different persons and an\r\nentirely different quality of goods produced, just as two cooks can take\r\nthe same kind of flour and one will produce a delightful loaf of bread\r\nwhile the bread of the other will not be fit to eat.\r\n\r\nWe age our Bee Brand Extracts for two years in white oak casks before\r\nplacing them on the market. Thus they become mellow and have a rich,\r\ndainty bouquet, which cannot be obtained by any other process. The\r\nminimum cost of carrying large vats of Vanilla is about 12 to 15 per\r\ncent per year. A fine, properly aged Extract of Vanilla, such as Bee\r\nBrand, made from the best beans, would cost from $8.00 to $9.00 a gallon\r\nto manufacture, and yet “Strictly Pure U. S. Standard Extracts” can be\r\nmade to cost not over $3.50 per gallon.\r\n\r\nFrequently you will find that a cheap pure Extract of Vanilla is almost\r\nas strong as the fine, or high priced, Bee Brand goods, but its flavor\r\nis rank and it has not the same bouquet and delicacy of flavor, the\r\ncomparison between the two being the same as that between cheap cigars\r\n(three for 5 cents), which may be just as strong as a fine Havana, or\r\nstronger, which costs 25 cents, but the latter has a flavor and quality\r\nwhich the former do not approach.\r\n\r\nThe average consumer thinks if an Extract is pure it must be good, and\r\nis satisfied with that statement. This belief on the part of the\r\nconsumer is largely due to the fact that many jobbers and large\r\nretailers want their goods under their own names, requesting the\r\nmanufacturer to put up the cheapest Extract that will comply with the\r\nlaw, regardless of the kind of beans or other materials used in its\r\nmanufacture. They simply ask for goods that comply with State and\r\nNational laws, but you can readily see what the word “pure” means under\r\nthis condition.\r\n\r\nThese jobbers and retailers think when they have complied with the law\r\nthey have done all that is necessary. We refuse positively to sell our\r\nBee Brand goods, or any other Flavoring Extracts, under any other name\r\nthan our own.\r\n\r\nThe consumer must realize that purity is one thing, strength another,\r\nbut _quality_, the cardinal feature by which to judge, can be obtained\r\nonly by buying goods under the name of a reputable manufacturer.\r\n\r\nAt one time the use of the ground or pulverized Vanilla-Bean directly in\r\nthe article to be flavored was considered by bakers and ice-cream\r\nmanufacturers a strong card to feature in their advertising.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of Domestic Science into so many of our\r\neducational institutions, with the subsequent general interest which the\r\nmovement has aroused, the American housewife has come to learn that by\r\nthe use of the ground bean only one of the several flavoring principles\r\nis obtained, _i. e._, vanillin.\r\n\r\nThe other active agents may be obtained only by intensive processing,\r\nand thus a full-toned extract is secured.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of “Vanilla Compound,” or “Imitation Vanilla,”\r\nsold. This is made always from manufactured Vanillin or Coumarin, or\r\nboth. The natural Vanillin comes from Vanilla-Beans themselves. Put a\r\nfresh Vanilla-Bean where it is very cold and crystals will form on the\r\noutside. These crystals are pure Vanillin. For a long time this was\r\nthought to be the only flavoring principle of the Vanilla-Bean, but it\r\nhas been proven to be only one of a number.\r\n\r\nThe Vanillin in general use is manufactured by artificial means. It is a\r\nwhite powdery substance with a strong Vanilla-like flavor, but it lacks\r\nthat softness which only Vanilla-Beans produce. In the process of making\r\ncheap Extracts, Vanillin is frequently toned up in strength and pungency\r\nwith Coumarin.\r\n\r\nCoumarin occurs naturally in Tonka Beans and Deer Tongue. The Tonka Bean\r\nis a short, stumpy bean about 1½ to 2 inches long by ½ inch wide, and is\r\nused for flavoring tobacco. Coumarin is made commercially from the\r\nleaves of Virginia Deer Tongue and is manufactured in very large\r\nquantities, as it is cheaper than that made from Tonka Beans.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to know that Bee Brand Flavoring Extracts were\r\nawarded the only Gold Medal at the Jamestown Exposition, and that we now\r\nhave the only Gold Medal awarded Flavoring Extracts since the National\r\nPure Food laws have been in existence.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Awards had no connection with the Exposition Company,\r\nas it was appointed personally by Ex-President Roosevelt, who named Dr.\r\nHarvey T. Wiley as chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Bee Brand Manual of Cookery\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is the result of many years of conscientious effort to produce\r\na work which would be worthy of the title—The Blue Book of the Culinary\r\nArt.\r\n\r\nThe old Colonial homes of Maryland and Virginia, long famous for their\r\n“Southern Cooking,” have yielded most of the recipes. Graduates of\r\nleading Schools of Domestic Science have thoroughly tested and in some\r\ninstances revised the recipes, so that in the new edition we offer the\r\nPerfect Cook Book. The following pages are selected at random:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fish Salad\r\n\r\n  Some cold cooked fish\r\n  1 lettuce\r\n  3 tablespoons olive oil\r\n  1 tablespoon vinegar\r\n  1 hard boiled egg\r\n  ½ lemon\r\n  3 pickled gherkins\r\n  1 slice of cooked beet\r\n  Bee Brand pepper and salt\r\n  Few grains of Bee Brand ground red pepper\r\n\r\nFree the fish from bones; separate the pieces into small flakes; mix\r\nwith the lettuce, which must be well washed, wiped, and divided into\r\nshreds, season with salt, pepper and red pepper. Mix the oil and vinegar\r\nso that both are well incorporated; then pour over the fish and lettuce;\r\nmix carefully, and dish up in a pile on a china dish or salad bowl.\r\n\r\nGarnish with slices of lemon, sliced gherkins, or other green pickles,\r\nslices of beet, slices of hard cooked eggs, and some chopped parsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chiffonale Salad\r\n\r\n  1 cup diced celery\r\n  1 cup pulp of grapefruit\r\n  5 sliced and peeled tomatoes\r\n  4 chicory leaves\r\n  French dressing\r\n  McCormick’s Mayonnaise dressing\r\n  Chopped olives\r\n  Chopped parsley\r\n  Green peppers cut in thin strips\r\n\r\nBreak the chicory leaves into pieces for serving.

When well set and\r\nfirm, turn out on lettuce leaves, and serve with McCormick’s Mayonnaise.\r\n\r\nFor an added garnish, half of an English walnut may be placed carefully\r\nin the bottom of each cup before it is filled with the mixture, or may\r\nbe fastened to finish mould by means of a few drops of the liquid jelly\r\nand allowed to harden before sending to table.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Cream of Potato Soup\r\n\r\n  1 cup mashed potatoes\r\n  1 pint hot milk\r\n  1 extra cup milk\r\n  2 tablespoons butter\r\n  2 tablespoons flour\r\n  ½ teaspoon Bee Brand white pepper\r\n  ¼ teaspoon Bee Brand celery salt\r\n  ½ teaspoon Bee Brand onion extract\r\n\r\nMake a white sauce of the flour, butter and extra cup of milk as in\r\nabove recipes and add seasoning. Mix the mashed potatoes with the hot\r\nmilk, combine with white sauce and serve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Cream of Green Pepper Soup\r\n\r\n  1 quart clarified soup stock\r\n  2 onions\r\n  2 large or 4 small green peppers\r\n  Yolk of one egg\r\n  1 teaspoon salt\r\n  ½ teaspoon Bee Brand celery salt\r\n  ½ teaspoon Bee Brand white pepper\r\n\r\nChop onion fine, cut green peppers in strips about ¼ inch long.

Just before serving pour through the slits in the\r\ncrust one tablespoon of fine brandy. Serve mince pie warm.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly good served with plain vanilla ice cream.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Date Pudding\r\n\r\n  ½ lb. dates\r\n  3 tablespoons butter\r\n  ½ cup molasses\r\n  ½ cup milk\r\n  1⅔ cups flour\r\n  ½ teaspoon baking soda\r\n  ¼ teaspoon each of Bee Brand Cloves, Allspice, and Nutmeg\r\n\r\nStone dates and cut into small pieces. Melt the butter, add molasses and\r\nmilk. Mix the dry ingredients and sift to blend them thoroughly. Add\r\nthese to the butter mixture and lastly add the dates.\r\n\r\nPour into a buttered mold, cover with buttered paper and steam for one\r\nand one-half hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Salmon Loaf\r\n\r\n  1 can salmon\r\n  1 cup stale bread crumbs\r\n  2 well beaten eggs\r\n  ½ cup milk\r\n  1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley\r\n  2 tablespoons melted butter\r\n  Seasoning and salt—Bee Brand black pepper and Bee Brand paprika\r\n\r\nPick one salmon, discard bones and pieces of skin.

Cook to a smooth,\r\nthick cream, add seasonings, then the fish, picked over and shredded\r\nwith a silver fork; then egg yolks beaten until thick, then fold in\r\nwhites beaten stiff and dry. Turn into a buttered baking dish, and bake\r\nuntil firm and delicately colored—it will require about 45 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Quality vs. Purity\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enactment of the National Pure Food Law in 1906 did much toward\r\nawakening an interest in the purity of Foods and Drugs, and while it has\r\nbeen beneficial in a general way, it has had its disadvantages because\r\nit is not complete.\r\n\r\nThe people have been taught by the laws and the Pure Food propagandists\r\nto believe that the word “Pure” upon a package ensures that its contents\r\nare all right. Nothing can be further from the truth.\r\n\r\nAn article may be Pure and yet be of very Poor Quality; Purity means\r\nlittle. Quality means much. For instance, a Keifer pear is a Pure pear,\r\nyet in Quality it cannot be compared to the Bartlett pear. Consider the\r\ndifference in the quality of butter. Take a number of samples of butter\r\nand you will find that some of them will be unfit to eat, and others a\r\ndelight to use, yet they are all Pure butter, and the difference is in\r\nthe Quality. The tobacco in a “five-for-a-nickel” stogie may be a Pure\r\ntobacco, but it cannot be placed in a class with that of an imported\r\nHavana cigar selling at twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\nA Spice may be Pure, and yet come from a country known to produce\r\ninferior Spices. It may be Pure and yet inert. Consider the difference\r\nin Quality between Acheen Pepper and Tellicherry. They are both Pure\r\npeppers.\r\n\r\nA Vanilla Flavoring Extract made from rank Tahiti Beans costing $1.50 a\r\npound is a pure Extract of Vanilla, but how does its quality compare\r\nwith that made from high-grade Mexican beans, costing $6.00 a pound? So\r\nit goes all down the line.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: McCormick’s Bee Brand Celery and Salt]\r\n\r\nThe time is coming when consumers will realize that the important thing\r\nto look for in the purchasing of foodstuffs is not the word “Pure”—but\r\nthe name of the reputable manufacturer whose dealings are beyond\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE COLANNADE\r\n                       1332-1339 MT. ROYAL AVENUE\r\n\r\n                                           Baltimore, Md., Dec. 1, 1914.\r\n\r\nMessrs. McCormick & Co.\r\nBaltimore, Md.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: For twenty years past I’ve been using Bee Brand Extracts and\r\nSpices, and ever since you’ve added Teas to your products, I’ve used\r\nBanquet Blend.\r\n\r\nIt’s the finest tea I know of and it pleases all our guests.\r\n\r\nIf you care to use this letter, you have my permission.\r\n                           Yours very truly,\r\n                             The Colannade,\r\n                                                           M. E. McConn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Banquet Brand Tea\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this big drum all the dust and foreign matter is removed from Banquet\r\nTea.\r\n\r\nIt’s a vacuum process, and it acts in such a way as to thoroughly mix\r\nand blend the Teas when two or more are worked together.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Vacuum Tea Cleaner]\r\n\r\nThere are few Tea houses similarly equipped. Among the 2000 flavors in\r\nTea, the problem of selection and combining is big. It takes expert\r\nknowledge to produce a Tea like Banquet Blend. Four successive\r\ngenerations of Tea experts produced the man who weened Banquet Blend\r\nfrom among the many flavors.\r\n\r\nTeas from the highlands of Ceylon, from the interior of China and from\r\nthe hillsides of Japan—all blended in one masterful creation—the triumph\r\nof the tea-blender’s art.\r\n\r\nIn Banquet Blend there is a delicacy of flavor, a richness of bouquet, a\r\ncertain subtle softness, and none of that rankness which is found in so\r\nmany brands of tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Bee Brand Extracts\r\n\r\nThere are few houses engaged in the manufacture of Flavoring extracts\r\nwhich have at their disposal a laboratory such as this.\r\n\r\nEarly in their business career McCormick & Company realized that eternal\r\nvigilance in extract making would be the keynote of success.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A Corner of the Laboratory]\r\n\r\nThe services of expert chemists were engaged, a modern laboratory\r\nequipped and the work of producing the world’s finest flavors begun. The\r\ntask was not easy, nor has the expense been light, but today, and for a\r\nnumber of years past, these pioneers in the field of purer foodstuffs\r\nhave been reaping the harvest of seed sown years ago.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years which are required to “process” most Bee Brand\r\nFlavoring Extracts the goods are sealed in big white oak casks, where\r\nmuch of their characteristic mellowness is acquired.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Percolating Vanilla]\r\n\r\nThe making of Flavoring Extracts has long since been reduced to a\r\nscience, or, if you prefer, elevated to the station of an art. For\r\ntwenty-five years the manufacturers of Bee Brand Flavoring Extracts have\r\nbeen the first to experiment with whatever innovations which have\r\noffered for the betterment of the trade. In spite of many experiments,\r\nthe changes have not been drastic—the process remains much the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Bee Brand Spices\r\n\r\nThe rows of spice-mills, illustrated on page 5, are always of interest\r\nto the guest. Long before one comes to the spice department the\r\nfragrant, pungent aroma drifts out in friendly greeting. Big\r\nelectrically-driven mills pound away hour after hour, day after day,\r\nturning out savory Bee Brand Spices to tempt the fickle appetite of a\r\nbusy work-a-day world.\r\n\r\nIn this building one finds the products of the four corners of the\r\nglobe. It is, indeed, easy to understand Sheba’s tribute to Solomon when\r\nshe selected spices from among all the good things the world affords and\r\nsent them to his court.\r\n\r\nHere is the atmosphere of the Old World mingled with the commercialism\r\nof the New.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cordial invitation is extended you to visit the Bee Brand Plant when\r\nyou are in Baltimore. Courteous guides are at your disposal from 10 A.\r\nM. to 4 P. M. each day. Every nook and corner of this great institution\r\nis open for your inspection—there is nothing under cover, nothing to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\nThe management wants you personally to see the sanitary manner in which\r\nthe plant is run—the smiling faces of contented employees, who find\r\ntheir pleasure in their work. No note of discord here! Occasionally a\r\n“kicker” drifts in, but not for long. He has no place in “the spirit of\r\nthe hive.”\r\n\r\nTelephone Connections.\r\n\r\n                        THE INTERNATIONAL MUTUAL\r\n                   COOKS AND PASTRY COOKS ASSOCIATION\r\n                              OF NEW YORK\r\n                          154 WEST 44TH STREET\r\n\r\n  Societe Culinaire Philanthropique\r\n  Cooks and Pastry Cooks Association\r\n  Culinary Alimentary Association\r\n  Culinary Club\r\n  International Cooks Association\r\n\r\n                                                New York.

Gentlemen:—\r\n\r\n      To obtain the best results, we use and recommend for use “BEE\r\nBRAND EXTRACT OF VANILLA.” We find it an excellent Vanilla of a superior\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE INTERNATIONAL MUTUAL COOKS AND PASTRY COOKS\r\n    ASSOCIATION OF N.Y.

They have tried and tested them in\r\ncomparison with all other brands of extracts worthy of any consideration\r\nat all. There was only one possible verdict! Bee Brand was found\r\nsuperior in mellowness of flavor, in quality of ingredients; in fact, in\r\nevery way.\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen, Bee Brand Extracts were found to cook out less readily\r\nthan any other extract and to impart a finer fruit flavor than could be\r\nsecured in any other way.\r\n\r\nThis is as it should be. Bee Brand Extracts are the perfected result of\r\ntwenty-five years’ experience in scientific Extract Making. The highest\r\nquality raw materials are used exclusively and after intensive\r\nprocessing, Bee Brand Extracts are aged in white oak casks to bring out\r\ntheir distinctive mellowness of flavor.\r\n\r\nBee Brand Extracts were awarded the only Gold Medal at the Jamestown\r\nExposition and have been endorsed by “Good Housekeeping Magazine,”\r\nWestfield Board of Health and the highest authorities in Domestic\r\nScience.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: McCORMICK and COMPANY]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: IMPORTERS of SPICES]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  A Partial List of Bee Brand Products\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Spices, Etc.\r\n\r\n  Bee Brand Powdered Cinnamon\r\n  Bee Brand Saigon Cinnamon\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Nutmegs\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Ginger\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Allspice\r\n  Bee Brand Pickling Spice\r\n  Bee Brand Whole Cloves\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Cloves\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Mace\r\n  Bee Brand Turmeric\r\n  Bee Brand Whole White Pepper\r\n  Bee Brand Ground White Pepper\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Black Pepper\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Red Pepper\r\n  Bee Brand Ground Mustard\r\n  Bee Brand Celery Seed\r\n  Bee Brand Celery Salt\r\n  Bee Brand Onion Salt\r\n  Bee Brand Curry Powder\r\n  Bee Brand Rubbed Sage\r\n  Bee Brand Thyme\r\n  Bee Brand Marjoram\r\n  Bee Brand Tapioca, Granulated\r\n  Bee Brand Paprika\r\n  Bee Brand Tapioca, Pearl\r\n  Green Seal Salad Dressing\r\n  Green Seal Table Relish\r\n  Bee Brand Gelatine\r\n  McCormick’s Mayonnaise Dressing\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Flavoring Extracts\r\n\r\n  Bee Brand Almond\r\n  Bee Brand Banana\r\n  Bee Brand Cinnamon\r\n  Bee Brand Cloves\r\n  Bee Brand Jamaica Ginger\r\n  Bee Brand Lemon\r\n  Bee Brand Nutmeg\r\n  Bee Brand Orange\r\n  Bee Brand Peppermint\r\n  Bee Brand Peach\r\n  Bee Brand Pineapple\r\n  Bee Brand Raspberry\r\n  Bee Brand Strawberry\r\n  Bee Brand Rose\r\n  Bee Brand Vanilla\r\n  Bee Brand Wintergreen\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Confectioner’s Colors\r\n\r\n  Bee Brand Green\r\n  Bee Brand Blue\r\n  Bee Brand Yellow\r\n  Bee Brand Strawberry Red\r\n  Bee Brand Pink\r\n  Bee Brand Violet\r\n  Bee Brand Brown\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Banquet Brand Tea\r\n\r\nAll the leading varieties are packed under this brand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Bee Brand Gelatine\r\n                          Acidulated or Plain\r\n\r\nThis is the Gelatine which Dr. Vulté selected from among twenty samples\r\nsubmitted as being the very finest possible to procure.\r\n\r\nThe Dietetic Department of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, uses\r\nBee Brand exclusively.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: McCormick’s Bee Brand Gelatine]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
