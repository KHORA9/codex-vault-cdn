HOPKINS.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Illinois, Urbana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY JOHNSTON stood waiting on the broad veranda of an old-style\r\nSouthern home, on a bright November day in 1903. He had just come\r\nfrom Blue Mound Station, three miles away, with suit-case in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Would it be possible for me to secure room and board here for a few\r\ndays?\" he inquired of the elderly woman who answered his knock.\r\n\r\n\"Would it be possible?\" she repeated, apparently asking herself the\r\nquestion, while she scanned the face of her visitor with kindly eyes\r\nthat seemed to look beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, my name is Johnston,--Percy Johnston--\" he said\r\nwith some embarrassment and hesitation, realizing from her speech\r\nand manner that he was not addressing a servant.\r\n\r\n\"No pardon is needed for that name,\" she interrupted; \"Johnston is a\r\nname we're mighty proud of here in the South.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am from the West,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We're proud of the West, too; and you should feel right welcome\r\nhere, for this is 'Westover,'\" waving her hand toward the inroad\r\nfields surrounding the old mansion house. \"I am Mrs. West, or at\r\nleast I used to be. Perhaps the title better belongs to my son's\r\nwife at the present time; while I am mother, grandma, and\r\ngreat-grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir, you will be very welcome to share our home for a few days\r\nif you wish; and we'll take you as a boarder. We used to entertain\r\nmy husband's friends from Richmond,--and from Washington, too,\r\nbefore the sixties; but since then we have grown poor, and of late\r\nyears we take some summer boarders. They have all returned to the\r\ncity, however, the last of them having left only yesterday; so you\r\ncan have as many rooms as you like.\r\n\r\n\"Adelaide!\" she called.\r\n\r\nA rugged girl of seventeen entered the hall from a rear room.\r\n\r\n\"This is my granddaughter, Adelaide, Mr. Johnston.\"\r\n\r\nPercy looked into her eyes for an instant; then her lashes dropped.\r\nHe remembered afterward that they were like her grandmother's, and\r\nhe found himself repeating, \"The eye is the window of the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Dear, will you ask Wilkes to show Mr. Johnston to the southwest\r\nroom, and to put a fire in the grate and warm water in the pitcher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, that will not be necessary,\" said Percy. \"I wish to see\r\nand learn as much as possible of the country hereabout, and\r\nparticularly of the farm lands; and, if I may leave my suit-case to\r\nbe sent to my room when convenient, I shall take a walk,--perhaps a\r\nlong walk. When should I be back to supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"At six or half past. My son Charles has gone to Montplain, but he\r\nwill be home for dinner. He knows the lands all about here and will\r\nbe glad, I am sure, to give you any information possible.\"\r\n\r\nWith rapid strides Percy followed the private lane to the open\r\nfields of Westover.\r\n\r\n\"Is he a cowboy, Grandma?\" asked Adelaide, in a tone which did not\r\nsuggest a very high regard for cowboys. \"Anyway,\" she continued,\r\ndetecting a shade of disapproval in the grandmother's face, \"he has\r\na cowboy's hat, but he doesn't wear buckskin trousers or spurs.\"\r\n\r\nPercy's hat was a relic of college life. Two years before he had\r\ncompleted the agricultural course at one of the state universities\r\nin the corn belt. Somewhat above the average in size, well\r\nproportioned, accustomed to the heaviest farm work, and trained in\r\nfootball at college, he was a sturdy young giant,--\" strong as an ox\r\nand quick as lightning,\" in the exaggerated language of his football\r\nadmirers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFORTY ACRES IN THE CORN BELT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY JOHNSTON'S grandfather had gone west from \"York State\" and\r\nsecured from the federal government a 160-acre \"Claim\" of the rich\r\ncorn belt land. His father had received through inheritance only 40\r\nacres of this; and, marrying his choice from the choir of the local\r\nLutheran congregation, he had farmed his forty and an adjoining\r\neighty acres, \"rented on shares,\" for only three years, when he was\r\ntaken with pneumonia from exposure and overwork, and died within a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nPercy was scarcely a year old when his father was laid in the grave;\r\nbut to the sorrowing mother he was all that life held dear.\r\nExistence seemed possible to her only because she could bestow upon\r\nhim her double affection, and because the double duties which she\r\ntook upon herself completely occupied her time.\r\n\r\nShe was not in immediate financial need, for her husband had been\r\nable to put some money in the bank during the last year, after\r\nhaving paid for his \"outfit;\" the forty-acre farm was free from\r\ndebt, but under the law it must remain the joint property of mother\r\nand child for twenty years.\r\n\r\nWisely or unwisely she rejected every opportunity presented that\r\nwould have given Percy a stepfather. As daughter and wife she had\r\nlearned much of the art of agriculture, and, after some consultation\r\nwith a neighbor who seemed to be successful, she made her own plans.\r\n\r\nIn her make up, sentiment was balanced with sense. Even as a young\r\nwife she had sometimes driven the mower or the self-binder to\r\n\"help-out,\" and she had found pleasure and health in such hours of\r\nout-door life. \"I can work and not overwork,\" she said to her\r\nfriends; and in any case the crops seemed to grow better under the\r\neye of the mistress.\r\n\r\nSome years she employed a neighbor boy or girl, and always hired\r\nsuch other help as she needed. Prices were sometimes low and crops\r\nwere not always good; and only widowed mothers can know the full\r\nstory of her labor, love and sacrifice. With Percy's help he was\r\nsent to school and finally to the university, choosing for himself\r\nthe agricultural college, much to the surprise and disappointment of\r\nhis devoted mother.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" she asked, \"why should my son go to college to study\r\nagriculture? Have you not studied farming in the practical school of\r\nexperience all your life? Surely we have done as much as could be\r\ndone on our own little farm; and you have also had the benefit of\r\nthe longer experience of our best farmers hereabout, and of the\r\naccumulated wisdom of our ancestors. Oh, I had hoped and truly\r\nbelieved that you would become interested in engineering, or in\r\nmedicine, or may be in the law. I cannot understand why you should\r\nthink of going to college to study farming. Surely you already know\r\nmore than the college professors do about agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nPercy's mother had too much good sense to have raised a spoiled boy.\r\nHe had been taught to work and to think for himself. She loved her\r\nboy far better than her own life,--loved as only a widowed mother\r\ncan who has risked her life for him, and who has given to him all\r\nher thought and all her energy from the best twenty years of her own\r\nlife; but she had never let herself enjoy that kind of selfishness\r\nwhich prompts a mother to do for her child what he should be taught\r\nto do for himself. Despite his natural love of sport and the severe\r\ntrials he had often brought to her patience and perseverance during\r\nhis boyhood days, he had reached a development with the advance of\r\nyouth that satisfied her high ideal. His love and appreciation and\r\ntender care for her repaid her every day, she told herself, for all\r\nthe years of watching, working, waiting. Never before had he\r\nwithstood her positive wish and final judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was she who had told him that he alone must choose his\r\nlife work and his college course in preparation for that work; but,\r\nafter the years of toil, she had not dreamed that he would choose\r\nthe farm life.\r\n\r\n\"My darling boy,\" she continued, \"it leads to nothing. This little\r\nfarm is poorer to-day than it was when your dear father and I came\r\nhere to live and labor. To be sure, the lower field still grows as\r\ngood or better crops than ever; but I can remember when that field\r\nwas so wet and swampy that it could not be cultivated, and it was in\r\nthe work of ditching and tiling that field,\" she sobbed, \"that your\r\nfather took the sickness that caused his death.\"\r\n\r\nTears were in Percy's eyes as he put his arm about his mother and\r\nwiped her tears away.\r\n\r\n\"But I must tell you what I know to be the truth,\" she went on\r\nquickly. \"The older fields that your grandfather cultivated are less\r\nproductive now than when he received them from our generous\r\ngovernment. Indeed, it was your father's plan to continue to farm\r\nhere only for a few years longer until he could save enough to\r\nenable him, with what we could have gotten from the sale of our own\r\nforty, to go farther west and purchase a large farm of virgin soil.\r\nHe realized, my Son, that even that part of his father's farm that\r\nwas first put under cultivation was becoming distinctly reduced in\r\nproductiveness. He remembered, too, the stories often repeated by\r\nyour grandfather of the run-down condition of the once exceedingly\r\nfertile soils of the Mohawk Valley and other parts of New York\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\"And you know, Percy, there were many Dutch farmers settled in New\r\nYork. They were probably the best farmers among all who came to\r\nAmerica from the Old World. I have heard your grandfather explain\r\ntheir use of crop rotation, and they understood well the value of\r\nclover and farm fertilizers. But with all of their skill and\r\nknowledge, the land grew poor, and now the very farm upon which\r\nGrandpa was born is not worth as much as the actual cost of the farm\r\nbuildings. I hope you will consider all of this. The farm life is so\r\nunpromising for you, and there are such great opportunities for\r\nsuccess in other lines. Still I feel that you must decide this\r\nquestion for yourself my Son, but tell me why you would choose the\r\nlife and work of a farmer?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLINCOLN S VIEW OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY had listened without interrupting, grieved at her\r\ndisappointment, and open to any reasoning that might change his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"Mother dearest,\" he said, \"it was a year ago that you said I would\r\nhave only till this fail to decide upon my college course and that\r\nit should be a special preparation for my life work. I have given\r\nmuch thought to it. You said that I should choose for myself, and I\r\nhave not consulted much with others, but I have tried to consider\r\nthe matter from different points of view.\r\n\r\n\"You know the Christmas present you gave me of the Lincoln books?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know, and you have read them so much. I could not get you\r\nmany books, but I knew there could be nothing better for my boy to\r\nread than the thoughts of that noble man. But, Percy dear, Lincoln\r\nwas a lawyer, and he rose from the lowest walk in life to the\r\nhighest position in the country, and with much less preparation than\r\nmy own boy will have. Suppose he had remained a farmer! Surely no\r\nsuch success could ever have been reached. I am not so foolish as to\r\nhave any such high hopes for you. Percy; but if you can only put\r\nyourself in the way of opportunity; and make such preparation as you\r\ncan to fill with credit some position of responsibility that may be\r\noffered you! I had truly hoped that your study of Lincoln's life\r\nwould influence yours. To me Lincoln was the noblest of all the\r\nnoble men of our history, and I doubt not of all history, save Him\r\nwho came to redeem the world.\"\r\n\r\nPercy stepped to his little homemade bookcase and took a volume from\r\nthe Lincoln set.\r\n\r\n\"May I read you some words of Lincoln?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" she answered wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"On September 30th, 1859,\" said Percy, \"Lincoln gave an address at\r\nMilwaukee, before the State Agricultural Society of Wisconsin, and\r\nof all the addresses of Lincoln it seems to me that this is the\r\ngreatest, because it deals with the greatest material problem of the\r\nUnited States. I think I have scarcely heard a public address in\r\nwhich the speaker has not dwelt upon the fact that the farmer must\r\nfeed and clothe the world; and it seems to me that the missionaries\r\nalways speak of the famines and starvation of so many people in\r\nIndia and other old countries. Do you remember the lecture by the\r\nmedical missionary? Well, would it not he better to send\r\nagricultural missionaries to India and China to teach those people\r\nhow to raise crops?\r\n\r\n\"I have read and reread this address more than any other in the\r\nLincoln set. Let me read you some of the paragraphs I have marked.\r\n\r\n\"After making some introductory remarks about the value of\r\nagricultural fairs, Lincoln began his address as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'I presume I am not expected to employ the time assigned me in the\r\nmere flattery of the farmers as a class. My opinion of them is that,\r\nin proportion to numbers, they are neither better nor worse than\r\nother people. In the nature of things they are more numerous than\r\nany other class; and I believe there are really more attempts at\r\nflattering them than any other, the reason of which I cannot\r\nperceive, unless it be that they can cast more votes than any other.\r\nOn reflection, I am not quite sure that there is not cause of\r\nsuspicion against you in selecting me, in some sort a politician and\r\nin no sort a farmer, to address you.\r\n\r\n\"'But farmers being the most numerous class, it follows that their\r\ninterest is the largest interest. It also follows that that interest\r\nis most worthy of all to be cherished and cultivated--that if there\r\nbe inevitable conflict between that interest and any other, that\r\nother should yield.\r\n\r\n\"'Again, I suppose that it is not expected of me to impart to you\r\nmuch specific information on agriculture. You have no reason to\r\nbelieve, and do not believe, that I possess it; if that were what\r\nyou seek in this address, any one of your own number or class would\r\nbe more able to furnish it. You, perhaps, do expect me to give some\r\ngeneral interest to the occasion, and to make some general\r\nsuggestions on practical matters. I shall attempt nothing more. And\r\nin such suggestions by me, quite likely very little will be new to\r\nyou, and a large part of the rest will be possibly already known to\r\nbe erroneous.\r\n\r\n\"'My first suggestion is an inquiry as to the effect of greater\r\nthoroughness in all the departments of agriculture than now prevails\r\nin the Northwest--perhaps I might say in America. To speak entirely\r\nwithin bounds, it is known that fifty bushels of wheat, or one\r\nhundred bushels of Indian corn, can be produced from an acre.'\"\r\n\r\nPercy paused: \"You know, Mother, that our corn has averaged some\r\nless than fifty bushels per acre for the last five years, and, as\r\nyou say, the lower field has been much better than the old land, and\r\nI think you are quite right in your belief that as an average the\r\nland is growing poorer, although we cultivate better than we used to\r\ndo, and our seed corn is of the best variety and saved with much\r\ncare. But let me read further:\r\n\r\n\"'Less than a year ago I saw it stated that a man, by extraordinary\r\ncare and labor, had produced of wheat what was equal to two hundred\r\nbushels from an acre. But take fifty of wheat, and one hundred of\r\ncorn, to be the possibility, and compare it with the actual crops of\r\nthe country. Many years ago I saw it stated, in a patent office\r\nreport, that eighteen bushels was the average crop throughout the\r\nUnited States; and this year an intelligent farmer of Illinois\r\nassured me that he did not believe the land harvested in that State\r\nthis season had yielded more than an average of eight bushels to the\r\nacre; much was cut, and then abandoned as not worth threshing, and\r\nmuch was abandoned as not worth cutting.\"'\r\n\r\n\"I know it is true,\" said the mother, \"that wheat was once very much\r\ngrown in Central and Northern Illinois, but 1859 must have been an\r\nunusually poor year, for it was grown for twenty years after that,\r\nalthough it finally failed so completely that its cultivation has\r\nbeen practically abandoned in those sections for nearly twenty\r\nyears. However, the chinch bugs were a very important factor in\r\ndiscouraging wheat growing and the land has been very good for corn,\r\nespecially since the tile-drainage was put in; but on the whole is\r\nit not as I told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"But note these statements,\" said Percy, turning again to the book:\r\n\r\n\"'It is true that heretofore we have had better crops with no better\r\ncultivation, but I believe that it is also true that the soil has\r\nnever been pushed up to one-half of its capacity.\r\n\r\n\"'What would be the effect upon the farming interest to push the\r\nsoil up to something near its full capacity?'\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can he mean,\" said the mother. \"How can anyone do better\r\nthan we have done? We change our crops, and sow clover with the\r\noats, and return as much as we can to the land. But let me hear\r\nfurther what Lincoln said:\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mother, this is what he said:\r\n\r\n\"'Unquestionably it will take more labor to produce fifty bushels of\r\nwheat from an acre than it will to produce ten bushels from the same\r\nacre; but will it take more labor to produce fifty bushels from one\r\nacre than from five? Unquestionably thorough cultivation will\r\nrequire more labor to the acre; but will it require more to the\r\nbushel? If it should require just as much to the bushel, there are\r\nsome probable, and several certain, advantages in favor of the\r\nthorough practice. It is probable it would develop those unknown\r\ncauses which of late years have cut down our crops below their\r\nformer average. It is almost certain, I think, that by deeper\r\nplowing, analysis of the soils, experiments with manures and\r\nvarieties of seeds, observance of seasons, and the like, these\r\ncauses would be discovered and remedied. It is certain that thorough\r\ncultivation would spare half, or more than half, the cost of land,\r\nsimply because the same produce would be got from half, or from less\r\nthan half, the quantity of land. This proposition is self-evident,\r\nand can be made no plainer by repetitions or illustrations. The cost\r\nof land is a great item, even in new countries, and it constantly\r\ngrows greater and greater, in comparison with other items, as the\r\ncountry grows older.'\"\r\n\r\nPercy paused and said: \"If I understand correctly these words of\r\nLincoln, the land need not become poor. But I do not know why land\r\nbecomes poor. I do not know what the soil contains, nor do I know\r\nwhat corn is made of. We plow the ground and plant the seed and\r\ncultivate and harvest the crop, but I do not know what the corn\r\ncrop, or any crop, takes from the soil. I want to learn how to\r\nanalyze the soil and crop and to find out, if possible, why soils\r\nbecome poor, in order, as Lincoln suggests, that the cause may be\r\ndiscovered and remedied.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be that the college professors could teach you in that way,\"\r\nsaid the mother, \"but you know the farm life is so full of work and\r\nso empty of mental culture.\"\r\n\r\n\"I used to think so too,\" said Percy, \"but I fear we have worked too\r\nmuch with our hands and too little with our minds; that we have done\r\nmuch work in blindness as to the actual causes that control our crop\r\nyields; and that we have not found the mental culture that may be\r\nfound in the farm life. Let me read again. These are Lincolns words:\r\n\r\n\"'No other human occupation opens so wide a field for the profitable\r\nand agreeable combination of labor with cultivated thought, as\r\nagriculture. I know nothing so pleasant to the mind as the discovery\r\nof anything that is at once new and valuable--nothing that so\r\nlightens and sweetens toil as the hopeful pursuit of such discovery.\r\nAnd how vast and how varied a field is agriculture for such\r\ndiscovery! The mind, already trained to thought in the country\r\nschool, or higher school, cannot fail to find there an exhaustless\r\nsource of enjoyment. Every blade of grass is a study; and to produce\r\ntwo where there was but one is both a profit and a pleasure. And not\r\ngrass alone. but soils, seeds, and seasons--hedges, ditches, and\r\nfences--draining, droughts, and irrigation--plowing, hoeing, and\r\nharrowing--reaping, mowing, and threshing--saving crops, pests of\r\ncrops, diseases of crops, and what will prevent or cure\r\nthem--implements, utensils, and machines, their relative merits, and\r\nhow to improve them--hogs, horses, and cattle--sheep, goats and\r\npoultry--trees, shrubs, fruits, plants, and flowers--the thousand\r\nthings of which these are specimens--each a world of study within\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"'In all this book learning is available. A capacity and taste for\r\nreading gives access to whatever has already been discovered by\r\nothers. It is the key, or one of the keys, to the already solved\r\nproblems. And not only so; it gives a relish and facility for\r\nsuccessfully pursuing the unsolved ones. The rudiments of science\r\nare available, and highly available. Some knowledge of botany\r\nassists in dealing with the vegetable world--with all growing crops.\r\nChemistry assists in the analysis of soils, selection and\r\napplication of manures, and in numerous other ways. The mechanical\r\nbranches of natural philosophy are ready help in almost everything,\r\nbut especially in reference to implements and machinery.\r\n\r\n\"'The thought recurs that education--cultivated thought--can best be\r\ncombined with agricultural labor, on the principle of thorough work;\r\nthat careless, half-performed, slovenly work makes no place for such\r\ncombination; and thorough work, again, renders sufficient the\r\nsmallest quantity of ground to each man; and this, again, conforms\r\nto what must occur in a world less inclined to wars and more devoted\r\nto the arts of peace than heretofore. Population must increase\r\nrapidly, more rapidly than in former times, and ere long the most\r\nvaluable of all arts will be the art of deriving a comfortable\r\nsubsistence from the smallest area of soil. No community whose every\r\nmember possesses this art, can ever be the victim of oppression in\r\nany of its forms. Such community will be alike independent of\r\ncrowned kings, money kings, and land kings.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLIFE'S CHOICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY read these words as though they were his own; and perhaps we\r\nmay say they were his own, for, as Emerson says: \"Thought is the\r\nproperty of him who can entertain it.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother listened, first with wonder; then with deepened interest,\r\nwhich changed to admiration for the language and for her son, who\r\nseemed to be filled with the spirit which had led Lincoln to see the\r\nproblems and the possibilities of the farm life in a light that was\r\nwholly new.\r\n\r\n\"Surely those are noble thoughts,\" she said, \"from a noble and wise\r\nman. I shall only hope that you will find some opportunity to make\r\nthe best possible of your life. We have such a small farm, and the\r\nland hereabout is all so high in price that to enlarge the farm\r\nseems almost hopeless. In part because of this difficulty it had\r\nseemed to me that greater opportunities might be open for you in\r\nother lines. Don't you feel that you will be greatly handicapped in\r\nthe beginning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Percy, \"in some ways; but not in other ways. We hear\r\non every hand that this is an age of specialists, that the most\r\nsuccessful man cannot take time to prepare himself well for many\r\ndifferent lines of work; that he must make the best possible\r\npreparation in some one line for which he may have special talent or\r\nspecial interest; and then endeavor to go farther in that line than\r\nany one has gone before. When I first wrote to the State University\r\nI asked how long a time would likely be required for me to complete\r\nall the subjects that are taught there, and the registrar replied\r\nthat, if I could carry heavy work every year, I might hope to take\r\nall the courses now offered in about seventy years. In considering\r\nthis point of preparation for future work, it has seemed to me that\r\nif I leave the farm life and devote myself to law or to engineering,\r\nI must in large measure sacrifice about ten years of valuable\r\nexperience in practical agriculture. I have learned enough about\r\nfarming so that I can manage almost as well as the neighbors; and\r\nwithout this knowledge, gathered, as you say, in the school of\r\nexperience, I can see that serious mistakes would often be made.\r\n\r\n\"You know that Doctor Miller bought the Bronson farm two years ago.\r\nWell, he has been giving some directions himself concerning its\r\nmanagement. He has had no experience in farming, and last year,\r\nafter he had the new barn built, he directed his men to put the\r\nsheaf oats in the barn so they would be safe from the weather. He\r\ndid not understand that oats must stand in the shock for two or\r\nthree weeks to become thoroughly \"cured\" before they can safely be\r\neven stacked out of doors; and the result was that his entire oat\r\ncrop rotted in the barn.\r\n\r\n\"People who have lived always in the city sometimes express the most\r\namusing opinions of farm conditions so well understood even by a\r\nten-year-old country boy. I recently overheard two traveling men\r\nremarking about the differences which they could plainly observe\r\nbetween the corn crops in different fields as they rode past in the\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n\"'Some fields have twice as good corn as other adjoining fields,'\r\none remarked. 'How do you account for the difference,' asked the\r\nother. 'oh, I suppose the one farmer was too stingy of his seed,'\r\nwas the reply.\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced that there are hundreds or perhaps thousands of\r\nvaluable facts that have been acquired through experience and\r\nobservation by the average farm boy of eighteen or twenty years that\r\nwould be of little or no value to him in most other occupations; and\r\nin this respect I should be handicapped if I leave the farm life and\r\nbegin wholly at the bottom in some other profession. Perhaps\r\nagriculture is not a profession, but I think it should be if the\r\nhighest success is to be attained.\"\r\n\r\n\"I surely hope you will be successful, Percy, and your reasoning\r\nsounds all right; but other occupations seem to lead to greater\r\nwealth than farming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I very much doubt,\" replied Percy, \"if there is any other\r\noccupation that is so uniformly successful as farming, in the truest\r\nsense. It provides constant employment, a good living, and a\r\ncomfortable home for nearly all who engage in it; and as a rule they\r\nhave made no such preparation as is required for most other lines of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"But there is still another side to the farm life, Mother dear, or\r\nto any life for that matter. Your own life has taught me that to\r\nwork for the love of others is a motive which directs the noblest\r\nlives. If agricultural missionaries are needed in India, they are\r\nalso needed in parts of our own country where farm lands that were\r\nonce productive are now greatly depleted and in some cases even\r\nabandoned for farming; and. if the older lands of the corn belt are\r\nalready showing a decrease in productive power, we need the\r\nmissionary even here. If I can learn how to make land richer and\r\nricher and lead others to follow such a system, I should find much\r\nsatisfaction in the effort.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWORN OUT FARMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WELL, you found some mighty poor land, I reckon,\" was the greeting\r\nPercy received from Grandma West as he returned from his walk over\r\nWestover and some neighboring farms.\r\n\r\n\"I found some land that produces very poor crops,\" he replied, \"but\r\nI don't know yet whether I should say that the land is poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know it's about as poor as poor can be; but it was not\r\nalways poor, I can tell you. When I was a girl, if this farm did not\r\nproduce five or six thousands bushels of wheat, we thought it a poor\r\ncrop; but now, if we get five or six hundred bushels, we think we\r\nare doing pretty well. My husband's father paid sixty-eight dollars\r\nan acre for some of this land, and it was worth more than that a few\r\nyears later and, mind you, in those days wheat was worth less and\r\nniggers a mighty sight more than they are nowadays; but, somehow,\r\nthe land has just grown poor. We don't know how. We have worked\r\nhard, and we have kept as much stock as we could, but we could never\r\nproduce enough fertilizer on the farm to go very far on a thousand\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir, we have just about a thousand acres here and we still own\r\nit,--and with no mortgage on it, I'm mighty glad to say. But, laws,\r\nthe land is poor, and you can get all the land you want about here\r\nfor ten dollars an acre. There comes Charles, now. He can tell you\r\nall about this country for more than twenty miles, I reckon.\r\n\r\n\"Wilkes!\" A negro servant answered the call, and took the horse as\r\nCharles West stopped at the side gate.\r\n\r\n\"Wilkes was born here in slave times, nigh sixty years ago,\" she\r\ncontinued. \"He is three years older than my son Charles. He has\r\nremained with us ever since the war, except for a few months when he\r\nwent away one time just to see for sure that he was free and _could\r\n_go. But he came back mighty homesick and he'll want to stay here\r\ntill he dies, I reckon.\r\n\r\n\"Charles, this is Mr. Johnston, Percy Johnston, as he says; but he\r\nthinks he is no kin of General Joe or Albert Sidney. He's been\r\nlooking at the land hereabout, but I don't think he'll want any of\r\nit after seeing the kind of crops we raise.\"\r\n\r\nWith this introduction, the mother disappeared within the house, and\r\nCharles took her seat on the vine-covered veranda.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that I owe an apology to you, Sir,\" said Percy, \"for\r\npresenting myself here with bag and baggage, and asking to share the\r\nhospitality of your home, with no previous arrangements having been\r\nmade; but by chance I met your friend, Doctor Goddard, on the train,\r\nand, in answer to my inquiry as to whom I could go to for correct\r\ninformation concerning the history and present condition and value\r\nof farm lands in this section of the country, he advised me to stop\r\noff at Blue Mound Station and consult with you. Had I known that you\r\nwere to be in Montplain to-day, of course I should have gone\r\ndirectly there. Your mother very graciously consented to receive me\r\nas a belated summer boarder, a kindness which I greatly appreciate,\r\nI assure you.\r\n\r\n\"My mother and I have a small farm in Illinois,--so small that it\r\nwould be lost in such an estate as Westover, but the price of land\r\nis very high in the West at the present time; and I am really\r\nconsidering the question of selling our little forty-acre farm and\r\npurchasing two or three hundred acres in the East or South. My\r\nthought is that I might secure a farm that was once good land, but\r\nthat has been run down to such an extent that it can be bought for\r\nperhaps ten or twenty dollars an acre. I should want the land to be\r\nnearly level so that it would not be difficult to prevent damage\r\nfrom surface washing. I should prefer, of course, to purchase where\r\nthere is a good road and not more than five miles from a railway\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n\"If I secure such a farm, it would be my purpose to restore its\r\nfertility. If possible I should want to make the land at least as\r\nproductive as it ever was, even in its virgin state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir,\" said Mr. West, \"if you could accomplish your purpose\r\nand ultimately show a balance on the right side of the ledger, it\r\nwould be a work of very great value to this country. There will be\r\nno difficulty in securing such land as you want with location and\r\nprice to suit you; but I think that you should know in advance that\r\nolder men than you have purchased farms hereabout with very similar\r\nintentions, but with the ultimate result that they have lost more,\r\nfinancially, than we who are native to the soil; for, while we were\r\nonce well-to-do and are now poor, we still own our land,\r\nimpoverished as it is. However, the farm still furnishes us a\r\ncomfortable living, supplemented, to be sure, with some income from\r\nother sources.\r\n\r\n\"I am very willing to give as much information as I can regarding\r\nour lands and the agricultural conditions and common practices,\r\nalthough I fear that this knowledge will discourage you from making\r\nany investments in our worn-out farms. If you still decide to make\r\nthe trial, I surely hope you will be successful, for we need such an\r\nobject lesson above all else.\r\n\r\n\"I assume that you will wish to locate near a town of considerable\r\nsize, in order that you can haul manures from town, and perhaps some\r\nfeed also; and have a good market for your milk and other products.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir,\" said Percy, \"I should prefer not to engage in dairying,\r\nand I do not wish to make use of fertilizer made from my neighbors'\r\ncrops. We have some object lessons of that kind in my own state; and\r\nI have no doubt that some can be found in this state who feed all\r\nthey produce on their own land and perhaps even larger amounts of\r\nfeed purchased from their neighbors, or hauled from town, and who,\r\nin addition to using all of the farm fertilizer thus produced, haul\r\nconsiderable amounts of such materials from the livery stables in\r\ntown. With much hard work, with a good market for the products of\r\nthe dairy and truck garden, and with business skill in purchasing\r\nfeed from their neighbors when prices are low, such men succeed as\r\nindividuals; but do they furnish an object lesson which could be\r\nfollowed by the general farmer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not looked at the matter from that point of view,\" said Mr.\r\nWest, \"but it is plain to see that on the whole there can be only a\r\nsmall percentage of such farmers; and in reality they are a\r\ndetriment to their neighbors who permit their own hay and grain to\r\nbe hauled off from their farms; but certainly these are the methods\r\nfollowed by our most successful farmers, and these are they who live\r\non the fat of the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they farmers or are they manufacturers?\" asked Percy. \"It seems\r\nto me that, in large measure, their business is to manufacture a\r\nfinished product from the raw materials produced upon other farms,\r\neither in the immediate neighborhood or in the newer regions of the\r\nWest. As you know, much of our surplus produce from the farms of the\r\ncorn belt is shipped into the eastern and southern states, there to\r\nbe used as food for man and beast, not only in the cities, but also\r\nto a considerable extent in the country. Instead of living on the\r\nfat of the land, such manufacturers live in the country at the\r\nexpense of special city customers who may have fat jobs and are able\r\nto pay fancy prices for country produce made by the impoverishment\r\nof many farms. In most cases, if such a 'successful farmer' were\r\ncompelled to pay average prices for what he buys and allowed to\r\nreceive only average prices for what he sells, his fat would have\r\nplenty of lean streaks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MUSICALE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDINNER was served at the family table, with Mr. West at the head and\r\nhis mother at the foot.\r\n\r\n\"The eye is the window of the soul,\" thought Percy, as he met the\r\nglance of Adelaide sitting opposite. Certain he was that he had\r\nnever before looked into such alluring eyes.\r\n\r\nAdelaide was neither a girl nor a woman and yet at times she was\r\nboth. With the other children she was a child that still loved to\r\nromp and play with the rest, free as a bird. Her mother, a\r\nsweet-faced woman, some years her husband's junior, made sisters of\r\nall her daughters, the more naturally perhaps, because the\r\ngrandmother was still so active and so interested in all phases of\r\nhomemaking that she seemed mother to them all. Adelaide's two older\r\nsisters were married and her brother Charles, also older than\r\nherself, by three years, was a senior in college. Adelaide had just\r\nfinished her course in the Academy where the long service of a\r\nmaiden aunt as a teacher had secured certain appreciated privileges,\r\nwithout which it is doubtful if both Charles and Adelaide could have\r\nbeen sent away to school at the same time. A boy of fourteen and the\r\neight-year old baby brother with two sisters between comprised the\r\nyounger members of the family.\r\n\r\nMiss Bowman, the teacher of the district school, also occupied a\r\nplace at the table. The evening meal was disposed of without delay,\r\nfor there was something of greater importance to follow. A musicale\r\nin the near-by country church had been in preparation and Percy\r\nheartily accepted an invitation to accompany the family to the\r\nevening's entertainment. Or rather he accompanied Mr. and Mrs. West\r\nand the grandmother, for all the children had walked the distance\r\nbefore the carriage arrived.\r\n\r\nWithout having specialized in music, nevertheless Percy had improved\r\nthe frequent opportunities he had had, especially while at the\r\nuniversity, and he had learned to appreciate quality in the musical\r\nworld. Consequently he was not a little surprised and greatly\r\npleased to sit and listen to a class of music that he had never\r\nbefore heard rendered in country places; but, as he listened for\r\nAdelaide's singing in chorus, duet, and solo, he found himself\r\nwondering whether the eye or the voice more clearly revealed the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed like the old times,\" said the grandmother, with something\r\nlike a sigh, as she took her place in the carriage. \"If our land was\r\nonly like it used to be! but it's become so mighty poor our children\r\ncan't have many advantages these days. The Harcourt's and Staunton's\r\nwhom you met are descendants of ancestors once well known in this\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that the land need not have grown poor,\" said\r\nPercy. \"If the land was once productive, its fertility ought to be\r\nmaintained by the return of the essential materials removed in crops\r\nor destroyed by cultivation. Surely land need not become poor; but\r\nof course I know too little about this land to suggest at the\r\npresent time what method could best be adopted for its improvement.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can tell you what the best method is,\" she quickly replied.\r\n\"Just put on plenty of ordinary farm fertilizer, but, laws, we don't\r\nhave enough to cover fifty acres a year.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time each seemed lost in thought, or listening to the husband\r\nand wife who sat in the front seat quietly talking of the evening's\r\nperformances. Percy recognized some of the names they mentioned as\r\nbelonging to persons to whom he had been presented at the church. It\r\ngradually dawned upon him that he had spent the evening with the\r\naristocracy of the Blue Mound neighborhood. Culture, refinement, and\r\npoverty were the chief characteristics of the people who had been\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\n\"It need not have been,\" he repeated to himself; \"surely, it need\r\nnot have been, \"and then he wondered if these were not much sadder\r\nwords than the oft repeated \"it might have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask where your people came from, Mrs. West?\" he questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Where we came from?\" she repeated, \"I don't quite understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said Percy, \"but in the West it is so common to ask\r\npeople where they are from. You know the West is settled with people\r\nfrom all sections of the East, and many from Europe and from Canada,\r\nand I thought your ancestors may have moved here from some other\r\nstate, as from Pennsylvania for example, where my mother's people\r\nonce lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me advise you, Young Man,\" said the grandmother briskly, and in\r\na tone that reminded Percy of the twinkle he had at times noticed in\r\nher eyes when she seemed young again--\"Let me advise you never to\r\nask a Virginian if he was born in Pennsylvania. That's more than\r\nmost Virginians can stand. Once a Virginian, always a\r\nVirginian,--both now, hereafter, and hitherto. It's mighty hard to\r\nfind a Virginian who came from anywhere except from the royal blood\r\nof England; although some may condescend to acknowledge kinship to\r\nthe Scottish royalty.\"\r\n\r\nThe grandmother's voice was raised to a pitch which commanded the\r\nattention of the other members in the carriage and a hearty laugh\r\nfollowed her jovial wit, to the full relief of Percy's temporary\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she continued, \"to answer your question: my husband and my\r\nchildren are direct descendants of Colonel Charles West, a brother\r\nof Lord Delaware, who was Sir Thomas West, whose ancestry goes back\r\nto Henry the Second, of England, and to David the First, of\r\nScotland; and my granddaughter is the great-granddaughter of Patrick\r\nHenry. So now you know where _we _came from,\" and she laughed again\r\nlike a girl. \"Yes,\" she added, \"we have a family tree six feet from\r\nbranch to branch, but it is stored in a back room where I am sure it\r\nis covered with cobwebs, for we have no time to live with the past\r\nwhen the summer boarders are here.\"\r\n\r\nAs the carriage stopped at the side gate, the children's voices\r\ncould be heard in the rear; for Mr. West had been living over again\r\nhis younger days with his sweet-faced wife, and the farm team had\r\ntaken its own time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA BIT OF HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NOW, I shall be at home to-day and glad to assist you in any way\r\npossible,\" announced Mr. West at the breakfast table.\r\n\r\n\"That is very kind of you,\" Percy replied. \"I want especially to\r\nlearn some of the things you know about the soils of Westover. Can\r\nyou show me the best land and the poorest land on the estate?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can.\" said Mr. West. \"We have some land that has not\r\ngrown a crop in fifty years, and we have other land that still\r\nproduces a very fair crop if properly rotated.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what rotation do you practice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the system we have finally settled into and have followed for\r\nmany years is to plow up the run-out pasture land and plant to corn.\r\nThe second year we usually raise a crop of wheat or oats and seed\r\ndown to clover and timothy. We then try to cut hay from the land for\r\ntwo years, and afterward we use the field for pasture for six or\r\neight years, or until finally it produces only weeds and foul grass.\r\nThen we cover it with farm manure, so far as we can, and again plow\r\nthe land for corn. Wheat and cattle are the principal products sold\r\nfrom the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this way,\" said Percy, \"you grow one crop of corn on the same\r\nfield about once in ten or twelve years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about that, and also one, or sometimes two, crops of small\r\ngrain. We usually have about seventy-five acres of corn, nearly a\r\nhundred acres of small grain, and we cut hay from somewhat more than\r\nhundred acres, thus leaving perhaps five hundred acres of pasture\r\nland, besides about two hundred acres of timber land which has not\r\nbeen cultivated for many years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the timber land that we see about here formerly cultivated?\"\r\nasked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, nearly all of it was under cultivation when I was a boy,\r\nalthough some had been allowed to go back to timber even before I\r\nwas born. On our own farm we have some timber land that, so far as I\r\nhave been able to learn, was never under cultivation; and the\r\ncharacter of the trees is different on that land. There you will\r\nfind original pine, but on the worn-out land the 'old-field' pine\r\nare found. They are practically worthless, while the original pine\r\nmakes very valuable lumber.\r\n\r\n\"With our system of rotation we keep about all of our farm under\r\ncontrol; but the smaller farms were necessarily cropped more\r\ncontinuously to support the family, and they became so unproductive\r\nthat many of them have been completely abandoned for agricultural\r\npurposes; and even some of the large plantations were poorly\r\nmanaged, one part having been cropped continuously until too poor to\r\npay for cropping, while the remainder was allowed to grow up in\r\nscrub brush and 'old-field' pine; and, of course, the expense of\r\nclearing such land is about as much as the net value of the crops\r\nthat could be grown until it again becomes too poor for cropping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the recleared lands are not as productive as when they were\r\nfirst cleared from the virgin forest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, by no means. In the virgin state these lands grew bountiful\r\ncrops almost continuously for a hundred years or more. Virginia was\r\nfamed at home and abroad for her virgin fertility. Great crops of\r\ncorn, wheat, and tobacco were grown. Tobacco was a valuable export\r\ncrop, and there were many Virginians whose mothers came to America\r\nwith passage paid for in tobacco. History records, you may remember,\r\nthat it was the custom for a time to permit a young man to pay into\r\na general store house a hundred pounds of tobacco,--and this was\r\nlater increased to one hundred fifty pounds,--to be used in payment\r\nof passage for young women who were thus enabled to come to America;\r\nand there was a very distinct understanding that only those who had\r\ncome forth with the tobacco were eligible as suitors for the hand of\r\nany 'imported' maiden. As a matter of fact some such arrangement as\r\nthis was almost a necessity,\" said Mr. West, as he noted Adelaide's\r\nalmost incredulous look. \"Among the first settlers in Virginia,\r\nyoung men greatly predominated; and in the main the people in the\r\nhome country were themselves in poverty. Under the hereditary laws\r\nof England the father's estate and title became the possession of\r\nhis eldest son; and in large measure the other children of the\r\nfamily were thrown absolutely upon their own resources, so that\r\nmany, even with royal blood in their veins, were very glad to\r\nembrace any opportunity offered to seek a new home in this land of\r\nvirgin richness.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he continued, smilingly and in direct answer to\r\nAdelaide's inquiring look, \"those young women were in no sense bound\r\nto accept the attention or the offer of any man; but naturally most\r\nof them did become the wives of those who were able to offer them a\r\nhusband's love and a home with more of life's comforts perhaps than\r\nthey had ever known before. They were at perfect liberty, however,\r\nto remain in the enjoyment of single blessedness if they chose, and\r\nI doubt not,\" he added, with a twinkle in his eyes, \"that some of\r\nthem had no other choice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWESTOVER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH an auger in his hand, by means of which a hole could be quickly\r\nbored into the soil to a depth of three or four feet, Percy joined\r\nMr. West for the tramp over the plantation.\r\n\r\nIn general the estate called Westover consists of undulating upland.\r\nA small stream crosses one corner of the farm bordered by some\r\ntwenty acres of bottom land which is subject to frequent overflow,\r\nand used only for permanent pasture. Several draws or small valleys\r\nare tributary to the stream valley, thus furnishing excellent\r\nsurface drainage for the entire farm. In some places the sides of\r\nthese valleys are quite sloping and subject to moderate erosion when\r\nnot protected by vegetation. Above and between these slopes the\r\nupland is nearly level. As they came upon one of these level areas,\r\ngrown up with small forest trees, Mr. West stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now right here is probably as poor a piece of land as there is on\r\nthe farm. This land will positively not grow a crop worth harvesting\r\nunless it is well fertilized.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we were in the Illinois corn belt,\" replied Percy, \"I should\r\nexpect to find the land in this position to be the most productive\r\non the farm. Our level uplands are now valued at from one hundred\r\nfifty to two hundred dollars an acre. A farm of one hundred eighty\r\nacres, five miles from town, sold for two hundred and fourteen\r\ndollars an acre a few days before I started east.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. West, \"this may have been good land once, but if so\r\nit was before my time. Of course most of our uplands here have been\r\ncropped for upwards of two hundred years; and about all that has\r\never been done to keep up the fertility of the soil has been to\r\nrotate the crops. To be sure, the farm manure has always been used\r\nas far as it would go, but the supply is really very small compared\r\nto the need for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that the proper rotation of crops would maintain the\r\nfertility of the soil?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"No, I have tried too many rotations to think that, but I suppose it\r\nis a help in that direction, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would say that crop rotation may help to maintain the supply of\r\nsome important constituents of a fertile soil, but it will certainly\r\nhasten the depletion of some other equally essential constituents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's a new idea to me. I may not quite grasp your meaning;\r\nbut first tell me about these tests you are making.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they stopped on the area of poor land as designated by Mr.\r\nWest, Percy had turned his auger into the earth and drawn out a\r\nsample of moist soil, which he molded into the form of a ball. He\r\nbroke this in two, inserted a piece of blue paper, and pressed it\r\nfirmly together. He then laid the ball of soil aside, secured\r\nanother sample with the auger, and formed it into a cake with a\r\nhollow in the upper surface. He took from his pocket a slender box\r\nor tube of light wood, removed the screw cap, and drew out a\r\nglass-stoppered bottle.\r\n\r\n\"This bottle contains hydrochloric acid,\" said Percy. \"It is often\r\nincorrectly called 'muriatic acid.' It consists of two elements,\r\nhydrogen and chlorin, from which its name is derived. But you are\r\nperhaps already familiar with the chemical elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I heard lectures at William and Mary for four years, and they\r\nincluded some chemistry as it was then taught; but they certainly\r\ndid not include the application of chemistry to agriculture, and I\r\nam greatly interested to know the meaning of these tests you are\r\nmaking here on our own farm under my own eyes. You may take it for\r\ngranted that I know absolutely nothing of such use of chemistry as\r\nyou are evidently turning to some practical value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any other farmer can make these tests as well as I can,\" said\r\nPercy. \"This bottle of acid cost me fifteen cents and it can be\r\nduplicated for the same price at almost any drug store. The acid is\r\nvery concentrated, in fact about as strong as can easily be\r\nproduced, but it need not be especially pure. Some care should be\r\ntaken not to get it on the clothing or on the fingers, although it\r\nis not at all dangerous to handle, but it tends to burn the fingers\r\nunless soon removed, either by washing with water or by rubbing it\r\noff with the moist soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I use this acid to test the soil for the presence or absence of\r\nlimestone. Ordinary limestone consists of calcium carbonate. Here,\r\nagain the chemical name alone is sufficient to indicate the elements\r\nthat compose this compound. It is only necessary to keep in mind the\r\nfact that the ending _-ate_ on the common chemical names signifies\r\nthe presence of oxygen Thus calcium carbon_ate_ is composed of the\r\nthree primary elements, calcium, carbon and oxygen.\r\n\r\n\"Of course the chemical element is the simplest form of matter. An\r\nelement is a primary substance which cannot be divided into two or\r\nmore substances All known matter consists of about eighty of these\r\nprimary elements; and, as a matter of fact, most of these are of\r\nrare occurence--many of them much more rare than the element gold.\r\n\r\n\"About ninety-eight per cent. of the soil consists of eight elements\r\nunited in various compounds or combinations; and only ten elements\r\nare essential for the growth and full development of corn or other\r\nplants. If any one of these ten elements is lacking, it is\r\nimpossible to produce a kernel of corn, a grain of wheat, or a leaf\r\nof clover; and in the main the supply is under the farmer's own\r\ncontrol. But we can discuss this matter more fully later. Let us see\r\nwhat we have here.\"\r\n\r\nPercy poured a few drops of the hydrochloric acid into the hollow of\r\nthe cake of soil.\r\n\r\n\"What should it do?\" asked Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"If the soil contains any limestone, the acid should produce\r\nfoaming, or effervescence,\" replied Percy; \"but it is very evident\r\nthat this soil contains no limestone. You see the hydrochloric acid\r\nhas power to decompose calcium carbonate with the formation of\r\ncarbonic acid and calcium chlorid, a kind of salt that is used to\r\nmake a brine that won't freeze in the artificial ice plants. The\r\ncarbonic acid, if produced at once decomposes into water and carbon\r\ndioxid. Now, the liberated carbon dioxid is a gas and the rapid\r\ngeneration or evolution of this gas constitutes the bubbling or\r\nfoaming we are looking for; but since there is no appearance of\r\nfoaming we know that this soil contains no limestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have already found that those three elements,--calcium,\r\ncarbon, and oxygen, you called them, I think--you find that those\r\nelements are all lacking in this soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, this test does not prove that,\" said Percy. \"It only proves\r\nthat they are not present as limestone. Calcium may be present in\r\nother compounds, especially in silicates, which are the most\r\nabundant compounds in the soil and in the earth's crust; and, as\r\nindicated by the ending _-ate, _oxygen is contained in calcium\r\nsilicate as well as in calcium carbonate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see; the subject is much more complicated than I thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewhat, perhaps,\" Percy replied; \"but yet it is quite simple and\r\nvery easily understood, if we only keep in mind a few well\r\nestablished facts. Certainly the essential science of soil fertility\r\nis much less complicated than many of the political questions of the\r\nday, such as the gold standard or free-silver basis, the tariff\r\nissues, and reciprocity advantages, regarding which most farmers are\r\nfairly well informed,--at least to such an extent that they can\r\nargue these questions for hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are quite right in that,\" said Mr. West. \"Of course, it\r\nis important that every citizen entitled to the privilege of voting\r\nin a democracy like ours should be able to exercise his franchise\r\nintelligently; but the citizen who is responsible for the management\r\nof farm lands ought surely to be at least as well informed\r\nconcerning the principles which underlie the maintenance of soil\r\nfertility; provided, of course, that such knowledge is within his\r\nreach; and from what you say I am beginning to believe that such is\r\nthe case. At any rate this simple test seems to show conclusively\r\nthat this soil contains no limestone, and it is common knowledge\r\nthat limestone soils are good soils.\"\r\n\r\nPercy took up the ball of soil containing the slip of blue paper,\r\nbroke it in two again, and it was seen that the paper had changed in\r\ncolor from blue to red\r\n\r\n\"There's a change, for certain,\" said Mr. West, \"that has some\r\nmeaning to you I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is litmus paper,\" said Percy. \"It is prepared by moistening\r\nspecially prepared paper with a solution of a coloring matter called\r\nlitmus, and the paper is then dried. This coloring matter has the\r\nproperty of turning blue in the presence of alkali and red in the\r\npresence of acid. The blue paper is prepared with a trace of alkali,\r\nand the red paper with a trace of acid. If more than a trace were\r\npresent the litmus paper would not be sufficiently sensitive for the\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n\"This little bottle containing two dozen slips of paper cost me five\r\ncents, and it can be obtained at most drug stores.\r\n\r\n\"Alkali and acid are exactly opposite terms, like hot and cold. The\r\none neutralizes the other. This test with litmus paper is a test for\r\nsoil acidity, and the fact that the moisture of the soil has turned\r\nthe litmus from blue to red shows that this soil is acid, or sour.\r\nThe soil moisture contained enough acid to neutralize the trace of\r\nalkali contained in the blue paper and to change the paper to a\r\ndistinctly light red color; and the fact that the paper remains red\r\neven after drying, shows that the soil contains fixed acids or acid\r\nsalts, and not merely carbonic acid, which if present would\r\ncompletely volatilize as the paper dries.\r\n\r\n\"Now, these two tests are in harmony. The one shows the absence of\r\nlimestone, and the other shows the presence of acidity, and\r\nconsequently the need of limestone to correct or neutralize the\r\nacidity, for limestone itself is an alkali.\"\r\n\r\n\"But limestone soils are not alkali soils, are they?\" asked Mr.\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the sense of containing injurious alkali, like sodium\r\ncarbonate, the compound which is found in the 'black alkali' lands\r\nof the arid regions of the far West; but chemically considered\r\nlimestone is truly an alkali; and, as such, it has power to\r\nneutralze this soil acidity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the acidity harmful to the crops?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not particularly harmful to the common crops of the grass\r\nfamily, such as wheat, corn, oats, and timothy; but some of the most\r\nvaluable crops for soil improvement will not thrive on acid soils.\r\nThis is especially true of clover and alfalfa.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is certainly correct for clover so far as this kind of soil is\r\nconcerned,\" said Mr. West. \"Clover never amounts to much on this\r\nkind of land, except where heavily fertilized. When fertilized it\r\nusually grows well. Does the farm fertilizer neutralize the acid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only to a small extent. It is true that farm manures contain very\r\nappreciable amounts of lime and some other alkaline, or basic,\r\nsubstances, but in addition to this, and perhaps of greater\r\nimportance, is the fact that such fertilizer has power to feed the\r\nclover crop as well as other crops. In other words it furnishes the\r\nessential materials of which these crops are made. In addition to\r\nthis the decaying organic matter has power to liberate some plant\r\nfood from the soil which would not otherwise be made available\r\nalthough to that extent the farm manure serves as a soil stimulant,\r\nthis action tending not toward soil enrichment but toward the\r\nfurther depletion of the store of fertility still remaining in the\r\nsoil.\"\r\n\r\n\"This seems a complicated problem,\" said Mr. West, \"but may I now\r\nshow you some of our more productive land?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I collect a sample of this,\" replied Percy, and to Mr.\r\nWest's surprise he proceeded to bore about twenty holes in the space\r\nof two or three acres. The borings were taken to a depth of about\r\nseven inches, and after being thoroughly mixed together an average\r\nsample of the lot was placed in a small bag bearing a number which\r\nPercy recorded in his note book together with a description of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to have an analysis made of this sample,\" remarked Percy, as\r\nthey resumed their walk.\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you had analyzed this soil,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I only tested for limestone and acidity,\" explained Percy. \"I\r\nwish to have exact determinations made of the nitrogen and\r\nphosphorus, and perhaps of the potassium, magnesium, and calcium.\r\nAll of these are absolutely essential for the growth of every\r\nagricultural plant; and any one of them may be deficient in the\r\nsoil, although\" the last three are not so likely to be as the other\r\ntwo.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take to make this analysis?\" was asked.\r\n\r\n\"About a week or ten days. Perhaps I shall collect two or three\r\nother samples and send them all together to an analytical chemist.\r\nIt is the only way to secure positive knowledge in advance as to\r\nwhat these soils contain. In other words, by this means we can take\r\nan absolute invoice of the stock of fertility in the soil, just as\r\ntruly as the merchant can take an invoice of the stock of goods\r\ncarried on his shelves.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as we are concerned, this would not be an invoice in\r\nadvance,\" remarked Mr. West, with a shade of sadness in his voice.\r\n\"If we knew the contents of the crops that have been sold from this\r\nfarm during the two centuries past, we would have a fairly good\r\ninvoice, I fear, of what the virgin soil contained; but can you\r\ncompare the invoice of the soil with that of the merchant's goods?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite fairly so,\" Percy replied. \"The plant food content of the\r\nplowed soil of an acre of normal land means nearly, if not quite, as\r\nmuch in the making of definite plans for a system of permanent\r\nagriculture, as the merchant's invoice means in the future plans of\r\nhis business.\r\n\r\n\"It should not be assumed that the analysis of the soil will give\r\ninformation the application of which will always assure an abundant\r\ncrop the following season. In comparison, it may also be said,\r\nhowever, that the merchant's invoice of January the first may have\r\nno relation to the sales from his store on January the second. Now,\r\nthe year with the farmer is as a day with the merchant. The farmer\r\nharvests his crop but once a year; while the merchant plants and\r\nharvests every day, or at least every week. But I would say that the\r\ninvoice of the soil is worth as much to the farmer for the next year\r\nas the merchant's invoice is to him for the next month.\r\n\r\n\"It should be remembered, however, that both must look forward, and\r\nplans must be made by the merchant for several months, and by the\r\nfarmer for several years. Your twelve-year rotation is a very good\r\nexample of the kind of future planning the successful farmer must\r\ndo. On the other hand, some of your neighbors, who have not\r\npracticed some such system of rotation now have 'old-field' pine on\r\nland long since abandoned, and soil too poor to cultivate on land\r\nlong cropped continuously.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a kind soil,\" remarked Mr. West, as he paused on a gently\r\nundulating part of the field.\r\n\r\n\"That is a new use of the word to me,\" said Percy. \"Just what do you\r\nmean by a 'kind' soil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we apply manure here it will show in the crop for many\r\nyears. It is easy to build this soil up with manure; but, of course,\r\nwe have too little to treat it right.\"\r\n\r\n\"The soil is almost neutral,\" said Percy, testing with litmus and\r\nacid. \"Does clover grow on this soil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little, except where we put manure.\"\r\n\r\nAnother composite sample of the soil was collected, and they walked\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"Now, here,\" said Mr. West, \"is about the most productive upland on\r\nthe farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that possible?\" asked Percy, the question being directed more to\r\nhimself than to his host.\r\n\r\n\"That is according to my observation for about fifty years,\" he\r\nreplied. \"Where we spread the farm fertilizer over this old pasture\r\nland and plow it under for corn, we often harvest a crop of eight\r\nbarrels to the acre, while the average of the field will not be more\r\nthan five barrels.--A barrel of corn with us is five bushels.\"\r\n\r\nThey had stopped on one of the steepest slopes in the field.\r\n\r\n\"These hillsides would be considered the poorest land on the farm if\r\nwe were in the corn belt,\" said Percy, \"but I think I understand the\r\ndifference. Your level uplands when once depleted remain depleted,\r\nbecause the soil that was plowed two hundred years ago is the same\r\nsoil that is plowed to-day; but these slopes lose surface soil by\r\nerosion at least as rapidly as the mineral plant food is removed by\r\ncropping; and to that extent they afford the conditions for a\r\npermanent system of agriculture of low grade, unless, of course, the\r\nerosion is more rapid than the disintegration of the underlying bed\r\nrock, which I note is showing in some outcrops in the gullies.\r\n\r\n\"I want some samples here,\" he continued, and at once proceeded to\r\ncollect a composite sample of the surface soil and another of the\r\nsub-soil.\r\n\r\n\"In the main this soil is slightly acid,\" said Percy, after several\r\ntests, with the hydrochloric acid and the litmus paper; \"although\r\noccasionally there are traces of limestone present. The mass of soil\r\nseems to be faintly acid, but here and there are little pieces of\r\nlimestone which still produce some localized benefit, and probably\r\nprevent the development of more marked acidity throughout the soil\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n\"If I can get to an express office this afternoon,\" he continued, \"I\r\nshall be glad to forward these four composite samples to an\r\nanalyst.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wouldn't mind riding to Montplain with Adelaide when she\r\ngoes for her music lesson this afternoon, it would be very\r\nconvenient,\" said Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"With your daughter's permission that would suit me very well,\" he\r\nreplied. \"I shall be glad to spend one or two days more in this\r\nvicinity, and then I wish to visit other sections for a week or two,\r\nafter which I would be glad to stop here again on my return trip and\r\nprobably I shall have the report of the chemist concerning these\r\nsamples.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK PERIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAS Percy stepped out of the house in the early afternoon upon the\r\nannouncement from Wilkes that \"De ca'age is ready,\" he noted that\r\nthe \"ca'age\" was the two-seated family carriage and that Adelaide\r\nhad already taken her place in the front seat, as driver, with her\r\nmusic roll and another bundle tucked in by her side. Her glance at\r\nPercy and at the rear seat was also sufficient to indicate his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"This does not seem right to me, Miss West,\" said Percy. \"Unless you\r\nprefer to drive I shall be very glad to do so and let you occupy\r\nthis more comfortable seat.\"\r\n\r\n\"No thank you,\" she replied, in a tone that left no room for\r\nargument. \"I often drive our guests to and from the station, and I\r\nmuch prefer this seat.\"\r\n\r\nThe rear seat was roomy and low, so that Percy could scarcely see\r\nthe road ahead even by sitting on the opposite side from the driver.\r\n\r\nAside from an occasional commonplace remark both the driver and the\r\npassenger were allowed to use the time for meditation.\r\n\r\nWhile Adelaide was already an experienced horsewoman, she was rarely\r\npermitted to drive the colts to the village, although she enjoyed\r\nriding the more spirited horses, or driving with her brother in the\r\n\"buck board.\"\r\n\r\nA mile from the village the road wound through a wooded valley, and\r\nthen climbed the opposite slope, passing the railway station a\r\nquarter of a mile from town and the \"depot hotel\" near by. Here\r\nPercy left the carriage with the bags of soil, it being arranged\r\nthat he would be waiting at the hotel when Adelaide returned from\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nAdelaide's \"hour\" was from four to five, and being the last pupil\r\nfor the day, the teacher was not prompt to close.\r\n\r\n\"I did not realize the days were becoming so short,\" said Miss\r\nKonster as she opened the door. \"I'm sorry you have so far to\r\ndrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" said Adelaide, \"I know the way home well enough.\r\nYou see I have the double carriage, for I brought a guest to the\r\ndepot as usual, although he is to return with me, and is probably\r\nvery tired of waiting at the 'depot hotel.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark as Percy took his place in the rear seat,\r\nAdelaide having again declined to yield her position as driver, and\r\nnow she had more packages nearly filling the seat beside her.\r\n\r\nThe team leisurely took the homeward way and nothing more was said\r\nexcept an occasional word of encouragement to the horses. They\r\npassed the lowest point in the valley and began to ascend the gentle\r\nslope, when the carriage suddenly stopped, and Adelaide uttered a\r\nmuffled scream. \"Come, Honey, said a masculine voice.\"\r\n\r\nAs Percy half rose to his feet, he saw that a negro had grasped\r\nAdelaide in an effort to drag her from the carriage. A blow from\r\nPercy staggered the brute and he released his hold of Adelaide, but,\r\nas he saw Percy jump from the carriage on the opposite side, he\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n\"De's a man heah. Knock him, Geo'ge,\" he yelled, as he turned to\r\nagain grapple with Adelaide\r\n\r\n\"Coward,\" cried Adelaide, as she saw Percy jump from the carriage\r\nand dart up the road. Facing this black brute, she was standing\r\nalone now with one hand on the back of the seat. As the negro sprang\r\nat her the second time he uttered a scream like the cry of a beast\r\nand fell sprawling on his face. Almost at the same moment his\r\ncompanion was fairly lifted from his feet and came down headlong\r\nbeside the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Look out for the horses,\" called Percy, as he drove the heels of\r\nhis heavy shoes into the moaning mass on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Lie there, you brute,\" he cried, \"don't you dare to move.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the lines,\" said Adelaide hoarsely, \"but can't I do\r\nsomething more?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. they're both down,\" he answered. \"Wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe found himself between the negroes lying with their faces to the\r\nground. Instantly he grasped each by the wrist and with an inward\r\ntwist he brought forth cried for mercy. It was a trick he had\r\nlearned in college, that, by drawing the arm behind the back and\r\ntwisting, a boy could control a strong man.\r\n\r\n\"Can't I help you?\" Adelaide called again, and Percy saw that she\r\nwas out of the carriage and standing near.\r\n\r\n\"Will the horses stand?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, they're quiet now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take the tie rope and tie their feet together. Use the slip\r\nknot just as you do for the hitching post,\" he directed. \"If they\r\ndare to move I can wrench their arms out in this position. Right\r\nthere at the ankles. Tie them tight and as closely together as you\r\ncan. Wrap it twice around if it's long enough.\"\r\n\r\nAdelaide tied one end of the rope around the ankle of one negro and\r\nwrapped the other end around the ankle of the other, drawing their\r\nfeet together and fastening the ends of the rope with a double\r\nhitch, which she knew well how to make.\r\n\r\nPercy gave the rope a kick to tighten it.\r\n\r\n\"Now get onto your feet and I'll march you to town,\" he ordered,\r\nadding pressure to the twist upon their wrists and drawing them back\r\nupon their knees Thus assisted, they struggled to their feet.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you will have to drive home alone, Miss West,\" began\r\nPercy, when Adelaide interrupted with:\r\n\r\n\"No, no, if you are going back to town, I will follow you. I can\r\neasily turn the team and I will keep close behind.\"\r\n\r\nThus tied together, Percy almost ran his prisoners toward the\r\nvillage, still holding each firmly by the wrist. As they reached the\r\n\"depot hotel,\" he called for assistance, and several men quickly\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nPercy made a brief report of the attack as they moved on to the town\r\nhouse, where the villians were placed in shackles and left in charge\r\nof the marshall.\r\n\r\n\"Will you drive, please, Mr. Johnston?\" asked Adelaide as he stepped\r\nto the carriage; for Adelaide had followed almost to the door of the\r\njail house.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, please,\" he replied, taking the seat beside her.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will pardon my calling you a coward, I felt so\r\ndesperate, and it seemed to me for the moment that you were leaving\r\nme.\" Adelaide's voice still had an excited tremor to it.\r\n\r\n\"I heard you say 'coward,'\" said Percy, \"but I didn't realize that\r\nyou referred to me. I saw the two brutes almost at the same time,\r\nthe one who attacked you and the other on the same side near the\r\nhorses' heads. I struck the one as best I could from my position,\r\nand as he yelled and the horses reared, I ran up the slope ahead of\r\nthe team and came down at the other brute with a blow in the neck,\r\nbut I was surprised to find them both sprawling on the ground; and\r\nunder the street lights I saw that one of them had an eye\r\nfrightfully jammed. I am sure I struck neither of them in the eye.\"\r\n\r\nAdelaide made no reply, but she knew now that the piercing, beastly\r\ncry from the negro reaching for her was brought forth because the\r\nheel of her shoe had entered the socket of the brute's eye.\r\n\r\n\"You're mighty nigh too late for supper, said grandma West, as they\r\nstopped at the side gate. Adelaide hurried to her father who took\r\nher in his arms as he saw how she trembled.\r\n\r\n\"My child!\" he said.\r\n\r\nYes, child she was as she relaxed from the tension of the last hour\r\nand related the experience of the evening.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot express our gratitude to you, Sir,\" said Mr. West: \"I am\r\nglad you landed the devils in jail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only thankful I was there when it happened,\" replied Percy. \"I\r\nam sure no man could have done less. I have promised to return to\r\ntown in the morning to serve as legal witness in the case. I hope\r\nyour daughter need not be called upon for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably that will not be necessary,\" Mr. West replied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE AND THE FREEDMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE others had retired but Percy and his host continued their\r\nconversation far into the night.\r\n\r\n\"There are almost as great variations among the negroes as among\r\nwhite people,\" Mr. West was saying. \"To a man like Wilkes who was\r\nborn and raised here on the farm, I would entrust the protection of\r\nmy wife and children as readily as to any white man. He has been\r\neducated, so to speak, to a sense of duty and honor; and negroes of\r\nhis class have almost never been known to violate a trust. Of course\r\nthere are bad niggers, but as a rule such negroes have grown up\r\nunder conditions that would develop the evil in any race of men.\r\n\r\n\"During the Secession it was the most common thing for the men to go\r\nto war and leave their defenseless women and children wholly in the\r\ncare of their slaves; and, even though the federal soldiers were\r\nfighting to free the slaves and their masters to keep them in\r\nslavery, rarely did a negro fail to remain faithful to his trust.\r\nThey hid from the northern soldiers the horses and mules, cotton and\r\ncorn, clothing and provisions, and all sorts of valuables; and in\r\nmost cases were ready to suffer themselves before they would reveal\r\nthe hidden property. To be sure there were masters who abused their\r\nslaves, and some of these were naturally ready to desert at the\r\nfirst opportunity; but in the main the slave owner was more kind to\r\nhis human property than the considerate soldier was to his horse,\r\nand the negro as a race is appreciative of kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the depreciation in soil fertility and crop yields dates\r\nlargely from the freeing of the slaves does it not?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was one factor, but not the most potential factor. Much\r\nland in the south had been abandoned agriculturally long before the\r\nwar, and much land in New York and New England has been abandoned\r\nsince the war. The freeing of the negroes produced much less effect\r\nin the economic conditions of the south than many have supposed. The\r\ngreat injury to the South from the war was due to the war itself and\r\nnot to the freeing of slaves. In the main it cost no more to hire\r\nthe negro after the war than it cost to feed and clothe him before;\r\nand the humane slave owner had little difficulty in getting plenty\r\nof negro help after the war. Very commonly his own slaves remained\r\nwith him and were treated as servants, not particularly differently\r\nthan they had been treated as slaves. Of course there were some\r\nbrutal slave holders, just as there are brutal horse owners, and\r\nsuch men suffered very much from the loss of slave labor.\r\n\r\n\"The southern people have no regrets for the freeing of the slaves.\r\nProbably it was the best thing that ever happened to us; and the\r\nSouth would have less regret for the war itself, except that our\r\nrecovery from it was greatly delayed by the reconstruction policy\r\nwhich was followed after the war. The immediate enfranchisement of\r\nthe negro, especially in those sections where this resulted in\r\nplacing all the power of the local government in the hands of the\r\nnegro, was a worse blow to the South than the war itself.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that this would not have been done if Lincoln had\r\nlived. Lincoln was always the President of all the people of the\r\nUnited States, and his death was a far greater loss to the South\r\nthan to the North. To place the power to govern the intelligent\r\nwhite of the South absolutely in the hands of their former ignorant\r\nslaves was undoubtedly the most abominable political blunder\r\nrecorded in history; and even this was intensified by the\r\nunprincipled white-skinned vultures who came among us to fatten upon\r\nour dead or dying conditions. Those years of so-called\r\nreconstruction, constitute the blackest page in the history of\r\nmodern civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said Percy, \"and so far as I know them the\r\nsoldiers of the northern armies also agree with you. Several of my\r\nown relatives fought to free the negro slave; but none of them\r\nfought to enslave their white brothers of the South by putting them\r\nabsolutely under negro government. And yet there is one possible\r\njustification for that abominable reconstruction policy. It may have\r\naverted a subsequent war which might have lasted not for four years,\r\nbut for forty years. Even if this be true, perhaps there is no\r\ncredit in the policy for any man who helped to enforce it, but you\r\nwill grant that there were two important results from those bitter\r\nyears of reconstruction:\r\n\r\n\"First, the negro learned with certainty at once and forever that he\r\nwas a free man.\r\n\r\n\"Second, he at once acquired a degree of independence effectually\r\npreventing the development of a situation throughout the South, in\r\nwhich the negro, though nominally free, would have remained\r\nvirtually a slave, a situation which, if once established, might\r\nhave required a subsequent war of many years for its complete\r\neradication. Even under the conditions which have prevailed, there\r\nhave been isolated instances of peonage in the southern states since\r\nthe war; and if the education and gradual enfranchisement of the\r\nnegro had been left wholly in the hands of their former masters,\r\nfrom the immediate close of the war, I can conceive of conditions\r\nunder which slavery would essentially have been continued.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a possibility is, of course, conceivable,\" said Mr. West, \"and\r\nwe must all admit that there were some slave holders who would have\r\ntaken advantage of any such opportunity; but had Lincoln lived the\r\nterms made would probably have been such that the South would have\r\nfelt in honor bound to enforce them. Probably the enfranchisement\r\nwould have been based upon some sort of qualification such as the\r\nsouthern states have very generally adopted in subsequent years; but\r\nthe idea of social equality of slave and master was so repulsive to\r\nthe white people of the South that it could not be tolerated under\r\nany sort of government.\"\r\n\r\n\"This question of social equality,\" remarked Percy, \"has probably\r\nbeen the cause of more misunderstanding between the North and the\r\nSouth than all other questions relating to the negro problem. I have\r\nrarely, if ever, talked with a southern man who did not have it\r\nfirmly fixed in his mind that the common idea of the northern people\r\nis that the negro race should be made the social equal of the white\r\nrace. This I have heard from southern lecturers; I have read it in\r\nsouthern newspapers; and I have found it in books written by\r\nsouthern authors; but, Mr. West, I have never yet heard that idea\r\nadvanced by a man or woman of the North.\r\n\r\n\"Of course there have been visionary theorists or 'cranks' in all\r\nages, and there must have been some basis for this almost universal\r\nerroneous opinion in the South that the people of the North\r\nadvocated social equality or social intercourse between the white\r\nand colored races; and yet nothing could be farther from the truth.\r\nIn all my life in the North, I think I have never seen a colored\r\nperson dining with a white man. This does not prove that there are\r\nno such occurrences, but it certainly shows that they are extremely\r\nrare. On the other hand, in traveling through the South I have seen\r\na white woman bring her colored maid or nurse, to the dining car and\r\nsit at the same table with herself and husband. Of course there is\r\nno suggestion of social equality or social intercourse in this, but\r\nthere is a much closer relationship than is common or would be\r\nallowed in the North.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be true,\" said Mr. West, \"and there was in slave times a\r\nvery intimate relationship between the negro nurses and the white\r\nchildren of the South. Some of our people are ready to take offense\r\nat the suggestion that we talk negro dialect, and perhaps we would\r\nall prefer to say that the negroes have learned to talk as we talk;\r\nbut the truth is that the negroes were brought to America chiefly as\r\nadults; and, as is usually the case when adult people learn a new\r\nlanguage, they modified ours because their own African language did\r\nnot contain all of the sounds of the English tongue. Similarly we\r\nhear and recognize the other nationalities when they learn to speak\r\nEnglish. Thus we have the Irish brogue, the German brogue, and the\r\nFrench brogue, or dialect.\r\n\r\n\"The negro children learned to speak the dialect as spoken by their\r\nown parents; and as a very general rule the white children learned\r\nto talk as their negro nurses talked. So far as there is a southern\r\ndialect it is due to the modification of our language by the negro.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have mentioned several things,\" said Percy, \"that are much to\r\nthe credit of the negro who has had a fair chance to be trained\r\nalong right lines; and I think the modficaton of our language which\r\nhis presence has brought about in the South is not without some\r\ncredit. It is generally agreed that the most pleasing English we\r\nhear is that of the Southern orator.\r\n\r\n\"Referring to social conditions, the most marked difference which I\r\nhave noticed between the North and South, and really, it seems to\r\nme, the only difference of importance, is that the South has\r\nseparate schools for white and colored, whereas in the North the\r\nschool is not looked upon as a social institution.\r\n\r\n\"As a rule no more objection is raised to white and colored children\r\nsitting on separate seats in the same school room than to their\r\nsitting on separate seats in the same street car. The school is\r\nregarded as a place for work, where each has his own work to do,\r\nmuch the same as in the shop or factory where both white and colored\r\nare employed. The expense of the single school system is, of course,\r\nmuch less than where separate schools are maintained; and perhaps an\r\nequally important point is that in the single system the same moral\r\nstandards are held up by the teachers for both white and colored\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"That point is worthy of consideration,\" said Mr. West. \"It is very\r\ncertain that a class of negroes has grown up in these more recent\r\nyears that was practically unknown in slave times when white men\r\nwere more largely responsible for their moral training. The vile\r\nwretches who made the attack this evening probably never received\r\nany moral training. It is conceivable that the moral influence of\r\nthe white children over the negroes in the same school might exert a\r\nlasting benefit, even aside from the influence of the teacher; and\r\nthe relationship of the school room could not be any real\r\ndisadvantage to the white child. But this could only be brought\r\nabout where white teachers were employed. Some such arrangement\r\nwould doubtless have been made had the mind of Lincoln directed the\r\ngeneral policy of reconstruction; but it is doubtful now if the\r\nnegro teacher will ever be wholly replaced, although time has\r\nwrought greater changes in political lines since the black years of\r\nthe reconstruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Percy, \"and those changes which have been brought about\r\nin the South have the full sympathy and approval of the great\r\nmajority of the Northern people. Indeed, it is extremely doubtful if\r\nthe North will be able to completely banish such a source of vice\r\nand corruption as the open saloon until limitation is placed upon\r\nthe franchise by an educational qualification.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nJUDGMENT IS COME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE goddess of sleep seemed to have deserted Westover. Adelaide lay\r\nin her mother's arms, either awake and restless or in fitful sleep\r\nfrom which she frequently awoke with a muffled scream or a physical\r\ncontortion. Once, as she nestled closer, her mother heard her\r\nmurmur: \"You must pardon me.\"\r\n\r\nPercy, from the southwest room, was sure he heard horses feet at the\r\nside gate. The murmur of low voices reached his ear, and then he\r\nrecognized that horsemen were riding away.\r\n\r\nThe house was astir at early dawn; and as soon as breakfast was over\r\nMr. West had the colts hitched to the \"buckboard\" and he drove with\r\nPercy to Montplain.\r\n\r\n\"I think your testimony will not be needed this morning,\" said Mr.\r\nWest, \"but it may be needed later, and it is well that you should\r\nreport to the officers at any rate, since you promised to be there\r\nthis morning.\"\r\n\r\nPercy pointed out the place where the attack had been made, and he\r\nlooked for a stump of a small tree or for any other object upon\r\nwhich the negro could have fallen with such force as to mash his\r\neye; but he saw nothing.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reached the village, Mr. West drove directly to the\r\ntown house; and there two black bodies were seen hanging from the\r\nlimb of an old tree in the courthouse yard. Percy noted that his\r\ncompanion showed no sign of surprise; and, after the first shock of\r\nhis complete realization of the work of the night, he looked calmly\r\nupon the scene. They had stopped almost under the tree.\r\n\r\n\"Are these the brutes who made the attack and whom you captured and\r\ndelivered to the officer?\" asked Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"They are,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"In your opinion have they received justice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" Percy replied, \"but I fear without due process of law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you, Sir, there is no law on the statutes under which\r\njustice could be meted out to these devils for the nameless crime\r\nwhich ends in death by murder or by suicide of the helpless victim,\r\na crime which these wretches committed only in their black\r\nhearts--thanks to you, Sir.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the town marshall approached followed by the negro\r\npastor of the local church and a few of his followers. Silently they\r\nlowered the bodies to the ground, placed them upon improvised\r\nstretchers, and carried them to the potters field outside the\r\nvillage, where rough coffins and graves were ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. West and Percy returned to Westover they discussed the lands\r\nwhich in the main were lying abandoned on either side of the road.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said Mr. West, as he paused on the brow of a sloping\r\nhillside, \"was as near to Westover as the Union army came. The\r\nposition of the breastworks may still be seen. The Southern army lay\r\nacross the valley yonder. These two trees are sprouts from an old\r\nstump of a tree that was shot away. About seventeen hundred\r\nconfederate dead were buried in trenches in the valley, but they\r\nwere later removed. The federal dead were carried away as the Union\r\narmy retreated. We never learned their number. For three days\r\nWestover was made headquarters of the confederate officers, and my\r\nmother worked day and night to prepare food for them.\"\r\n\r\nThey stopped at Westover for a few moments, Percy remaining in the\r\n\"buckboard\" while Mr. West reported to his family what they had seen\r\nin Montplain.\r\n\r\n\"Our report,\" said Mr. West, \"hideous and horrible as it is, will\r\nhelp to restore the child to calm and quiet. To speak frankly, Sir,\r\noccurrences of this sort, sometimes with the worst results, are\r\nsufficiently frequent in the South so that we constantly feel the\r\nadded weight or burden whenever the sister, wife, or daughter is\r\nleft without adequate protection.\"\r\n\r\nThe remaining hours of the morning were devoted to a drive over the\r\ncountry surrounding Westover; and Mr. West consented to Adelaide's\r\nrequest that she be allowed to drive Percy to the station at\r\nMontplain, where he was to take the afternoon train for Richmond.\r\nShe chose the \"buckboard\" but insisted upon driving.\r\n\r\nThey talked of their school and college days, of the books they had\r\nread, of anything in fact except of the experiences of the past\r\ntwenty-four hours. Even when they entered the valley no shadow\r\ncrossed Adelaide's face; but as they neared the station her voice\r\nchanged, and as Percy looked into her winsome, frankly upturned\r\nface, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Have I truly been pardoned for my cruel words last evening? I am\r\nsure you were as manly and noble as any man could have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am sure you were the bravest little woman I have ever known,\"\r\nreplied Percy, \"and I admire you the more for calling me a coward\r\nwhen you thought I was running away; so there is nothing to pardon I\r\nam sure.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand as a child at parting, but he thought as he\r\nlooked into her eyes that he saw the soul of a woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY carried with him a most interesting and attractive circular of\r\ninformation concerning the rapid restoration of the farm lands of the\r\nSouth. It also stated that further information could be secured from a\r\ncertain real estate agent in Richmond, who was found to be still in his\r\noffice when Percy arrived in the city late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe agent was delighted to receive a call from the Western man, and\r\nassured him that he would gladly show him several plantations not far\r\nfrom the city which could be purchased at very reasonable prices. Indeed\r\nhe could have his choice of these old southern homesteads for the very\r\nlow price of forty dollars an acre. A map of an adjoining county showed\r\nthe exact location of several such farms, some of which were of great\r\nhistorical interest. At what time in the morning could he be ready to be\r\nshown one of these rare bargains?\r\n\r\n\"What treatment do these lands require to restore their productiveness?\"\r\nasked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"No treatment at all, Sir, except the adoption of your western methods\r\nof farming and your system of crop rotation. I tell you the results are\r\nmarvelous when western farmers get hold of these famous old plantations.\r\nJust good farming and a change of crops, that's all they need.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does clover grow well?\" asked Percy. \"We grow that a good deal in the\r\nWest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, clover will grow very well, indeed, but cowpeas is a much\r\nbetter crop than clover. Our best farmers prefer the cowpea; and after a\r\ncrop of cowpeas, you can raise large crops of any kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you know of those who have been successful in restoring some\r\nof these old farms,\" Percy suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, Sir, many of them, and they are making money hand over fist,\r\nand their lands are increasing in value, and no doubt will continue to\r\nincrease just as your western lands have done. Yes, Sir, the greatest\r\nopportunity for investment in land is right here and now, and these old\r\nplantations are being snapped up very rapidly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to know of some of these successful farmers who are\r\nusing the improved methods. Will you name one, just as an example, and\r\ntell me about what he has done to restore his land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the agent, \"There's T. O. Thornton, for example. Mr.\r\nThornton bought an old plantation of a thousand acres only six years ago\r\nat a cost of six dollars an acre. He has been growing cowpeas in\r\nrotation with other crops; and, as I say, he is making money hand over\r\nfist. A few months ago he refused to consider fifty dollars an acre for\r\nhis land, but still there are some of these old plantations left that\r\ncan be bought for forty dollars, because the people don't really know\r\nwhat they are worth. However, our lands are all much higher than they\r\nwere a few years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where does Mr. Thornton live?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he lives at Blairville, nearly a hundred miles from Richmond. Yes,\r\nhe lives on his farm near Blairville. I tell you he's making good all\r\nright, but I don't know of any land for sale in that section.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I will go out to Blairville to see Mr. Thornton's farm,\" said\r\nPercy. \"Do you know when the trains run?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry to say that the train service is very poor to\r\nBlairvile. There is only one train a day that reaches Blairville in\r\ndaylight, and that leaves Richmond very early in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all right,\" said Percy, \"it will probably get me there in time\r\nso that I shall be sure to find Mr. Thornton at home. I thank you very\r\nmuch, Sir. Perhaps I shall be able to see you again when I return from\r\nBlairville.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you return from Blairville is about the most uncertain thing in\r\nthe world. As I said, the train service is mighty poor to Blairville,\r\nand it's still poorer, you'll find, when you want to leave Blairville.\r\nWhy, a traveling man told me he had been on the road for fifteen years,\r\nand he swore he had spent seven of 'em at Blairville waiting for trains.\r\nBetter take my advice and look over some of the fine old plantations\r\nright here in the next county and then you can take all the rest of the\r\nmonth if you wish getting in and out of Blairville.\"\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock the following morning Percy might have been seen\r\nwalking along the railroad which ran through Mr. Thornton's farm about\r\ntwo miles from Blairvile. He saw a well beaten path which led from the\r\nrailroad to a nearby cottage and a knock brought to the door a negro\r\nwoman followed by several children.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me where Mr. Thornton's farm is?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Suh,\" she replied. \"This is Mistah Tho'nton's place, right heah,\r\nSuh. Leastways, it was his place; but we done bought twenty acahs of it\r\nheah, wheah we live, 'cept tain all paid fo' yit. Mistah Tho'nton lives\r\nin the big house over theah 'bout half a mile.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what you have to pay for land here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we have to pay ten dollahs an acah, cause we can't pay cash. My ol'\r\nman he wo'ks on the railroad section and we just pay Mistah Tho'nton foh\r\ndollahs every month. My chil'n wo'k in the ga'den and tend that acah\r\npatch o' co'n.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you fertilize the corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Suh. We can't grow nothin' heah without fe'tilizah. We got two\r\nhundred pounds fo' three dollahs last spring and planted it with the\r\nco'n.\"\r\n\r\nAs Percy turned in at Mr. Thornton's gate he saw a white man and two\r\nnegroes working at the barn. \"Pardon me, but is this Mr. Thornton?\"\r\nasked Percy as he approached.\r\n\r\n\"That is my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my name is Johnston. I am especially interested in learning all I\r\ncan about the farm lands in this section and the best methods of\r\nfarming. I live in Illinois, and have thought some of selling our little\r\nfarm out there and buying a larger one here in the East where the land\r\nis much cheaper than with us. A real estate agent in Richmond has told\r\nme something of the progress you are making in the improvement of your\r\nlarge farm. I hope you will not let me interfere with your work, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this work is not much. I've had a little lumber sawed at a mill\r\nwhich is running just now over beyond my farm, and I am trying to put a\r\nshed up here over part of the barn yard so we can save more of the\r\nmanure. I shall be very glad to give you any information I can either\r\nabout my own farming or about the farm lands in this section.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have about a thousand acres in your farm I was told.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we still have some over nine hundred acres in the place, but we\r\nare farming only about two hundred acres, including the meadow and\r\npasture land. The other seven hundred acres are not fenced, and, as you\r\nwill see, the land is mostly grown up to scrub trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your corn appears to be a very good crop. About how many acres of corn\r\ndo you have this year?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only fourteen acres. That is all I could cover with manure, and\r\nit is hardly worth trying to raise corn without manure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you use any commercial fertilizer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've been using some bone meal. I've no use for the ordinary\r\ncomplete commercial fertilizer. It sometimes helps a little for one\r\nyear; but it seems to leave the land poorer than ever. Bone meal lasts\r\nlonger and doesn't seem to hurt the land. I see from the agricultural\r\npapers that some of the experiment stations report good results from the\r\nuse of fine-ground raw rock phosphate; but they advise using it in\r\nconnection with organic matter, such as manure or clover plowed under. I\r\nam planning to get some and mix it with the manure here under this shed.\r\nDo you use commercial fertilizers in Illinois?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to speak of, but some of our farmers are beginning to use the raw\r\nphosphate. Our experiment station has found that our most extensive soil\r\ntypes are not rich in phosphorus, and has republished for our benefit\r\nthe reports from the Maryland and Ohio experiment stations showing that\r\nthe fine-ground natural rock phosphate appears to be the most economical\r\nform to be used and that it is likely to prove much more profitable in\r\nthe long run, although it may not give very marked results the first\r\nyear or two. May I ask what products you sell from your farm, Mr.\r\nThornton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I sell cream. I have a special trade in Richmond, and I ship my cream\r\ndirect to the city. I also sell a few hogs and some wheat. I usually put\r\nwheat after corn, and have fourteen acres of wheat seeded between the\r\ncorn shocks over there. Sometimes I don't get the wheat seeded, and then\r\nI put the land in cowpeas. I usually raise about twenty-five acres of\r\ncowpeas, and the rest of the cleared land I use for meadow and pasture.\r\nI usually sow timothy after cowpeas, and I like to break up as much old\r\npasture land for corn as I can put manure on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was told that you had been offered fifty dollars an acre for your\r\nfarm, Mr. Thornton, but that you would not consider the offer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton laughed heartily at this remark.\r\n\r\n\"That must have come from the Richmond land agent,\" he said. \"Someone\r\nelse was telling me that story a short time ago. The fact is one of\r\nthose real estate agents was out here last spring and he asked me if I\r\nwould consider an offer of fifty dollars an acre for our land. I told\r\nhim that I didn't think that I would as long as any one who wishes to\r\nbuy can get all the land he wants in this section for five or ten\r\ndollars an acre. That's as near as I came to having an offer of fifty\r\ndollars an acre for this land. The land adjoining me on the south is is\r\nfor sale, and I am sure you could buy that farm of about seven hundred\r\nacres for four dollars an acre after they get the timber off. Some of\r\nthe land has not been cropped for a hundred years, I guess; and there\r\nare a few trees on it that are big enough for light saw-stuff. A man has\r\nbought the timber that is worth cutting, and he is running a saw over\r\nthere now; but he'll get out all that's good for anything in a few\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask how long you have been farming here, Mr. Thornton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelve years on this farm,\" he replied. \"You see this estate was left\r\nto my wife and her sister who still lives with us. We were married\r\ntwelve years ago and I have been working ever since to make a living for\r\nus on this old worn-out farm. Of course I have made some little\r\nimprovements about the barns, but we've sold a little land too. The\r\nrailroad company wanted about an acre down where that little stream\r\ncrosses, for a water supply, and I got twelve hundred dollars for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I've already taken too much of your time,\" said Percy. \"I thank\r\nyou for your kindness in giving me so much information. If there is no\r\nobjection I shall be glad to take a walk about over your farm and the\r\nadjoining land, and perhaps I can see you again for a few moments when I\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" Mr. Thornton replied. \"There is no objection whatsoever. We\r\nare going to Blairville this morning, but we shall be back before noon\r\nand I shall be glad to see you then. I fear you have been given some\r\nmisinformation by the real estate agents. Some of them, by the way, are\r\nNorthern men who came down here and bought land and when they found they\r\ncould not make a living on it, they sold it to other land hunters, and I\r\nsuppose that they made so much in the deal that they stayed right here\r\nas real estate agents. They are great advertisers; but I reckon our\r\nSouthern real estate men can just about keep even. The agent who was out\r\nhere last spring told me he showed one Northern man a farm for $12 an\r\nacre and he was afraid to buy. Then he took him into another county and\r\nshowed him a poorer farm for $45 and he bought that at once.\r\n\r\n\"The road there runs out through the fields. Our land runs back to the\r\nother public road and beyond that is the farm I told you of where the\r\nsaw mill is running. I've got some pretty good cowpeas you'll pass by. I\r\nhaven't got them off the racks yet.\"\r\n\r\nPercy found the cowpea hay piled in large shocks over tripods made of\r\nshort stout poles which served to keep the hay off the ground to some\r\nextent, and this permitted the cowpeas to be cured in larger piles and\r\nwith less danger of loss from molding.\r\n\r\n\"I find that the soil on your farm and on the other farm is very\r\ngenerally acid,\" said Percy a few hours later when Mr. Thornton asked\r\nwhat he thought of the condititons of farming. \"Have you used any lime\r\nfor improving the soil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I tried it about ten years ago, and it helped some, but not enough\r\nto make it pay. I put ten barrels on about three acres. I thought it\r\nhelped the corn and wheat a little, and it showed right to the line\r\nwhere I put cowpeas on the land, but I don't think it paid, and it's\r\nmighty disagreeable stuff to handle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember how much it cost?\" Percy asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir. The regular price was a dollar a barrel, but by taking ten\r\nbarrels I got the ton for eight dollars; but I'd rather have eight\r\ndollars' worth of bone meal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think the lime would be a great help to clover,\" said Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that might be. They tell me that they used to grow lots of clover\r\nhere; but it played out completely, and nobody sows clover now, except\r\noccasionally on an old feed lot which is rich enough to grow anything.\r\nIt takes mighty good land to grow clover; but cowpeas are better for us.\r\nThey do pretty well for this old land, only the seed costs too much, and\r\nthey make a sight of work, and they're mighty hard to get cured. You see\r\nthey aren't ready for hay till the hot weather is mostly past. If we\r\ncould handle them in June and July, as we do timothy we'd have no\r\ntrouble; but we don't get cowpeas planted till June, and September is a\r\npoor time for haying.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that clover is a much more satisfactory crop,\" said\r\nPercy. \"One can sow clover with oats in the spring, or on wheat land in\r\nthe late winter, and there is no more trouble with it until it is ready\r\nfor haying about fifteen months later, unless the land is weedy or the\r\nclover makes such a growth the first fall that we must clip it to\r\nprevent either the weeds or the clover from seeding. This means that\r\nwhen you are planting your ground for cowpeas the next year after wheat\r\nor oats, we are just ready to begin harvesting our clover hay; and\r\nbesides the regular hay crop we usually have some growth the fall before\r\nwhich is left on the land as a fertilizer, and then we get a second crop\r\nof clover which we save either for hay or seed. Even after the seed crop\r\nis harvested there is usually some later fall growth, and some let the\r\nclover stand till it grows some more the next spring and then plow it\r\nunder for corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see that clover would be much better than cowpeas if we could\r\ngrow it; but, as I said, it's played out here. Our land simply won't\r\ngrow it any more. Not having to plow for clover would save a great deal\r\nof the work we must do for our cowpeas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of our farmers follow a three-year rotation and plow the ground\r\nonly once in three years,\" said Percy. \"They plow the ground for corn,\r\ndisk it the next spring when oats and clover are seeded, and then leave\r\nthe land in clover the next year. In that way they regularly harvest\r\nfour crops, including the two clover crops, from only one plowing; and\r\nin exceptional seasons I have known an extra crop of clover hay to be\r\nharvested in the late fall on the land where the oats were grown.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the lime question,\" Percy continued, \"I wonder if you know\r\nof the work the Pennsylvania Experiment Station has been doing with the\r\nuse of ground limestone in comparison with burned lime.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never heard of ground limestone being used. I supposed it had to\r\nbe burned. I should think it would be very expensive to grind\r\nlimestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it costs much less to grind it than to burn it,\" Percy replied.\r\n\"Mills are used for grinding rock in cement manufacture, and the rock\r\nphosphate and bone meal must all be ground before using them either for\r\ndirect application or for the manufacture of acidulated fertilizers; and\r\nlimestone is not so hard to grind as some other rocks. Furthermore it\r\ndoes not need to be so very finely ground. If fine enough so that it\r\nwill pass through a sieve with ten meshes to the inch it does very well.\r\nThat you see would be a hundred meshes to the square inch; and, of\r\ncourse, a great deal of it will be much finer than that. In fact the\r\nground limestone used in the Pennsylvania experiments was only fine\r\nenough so that about ninety per cent. of it would pass a sieve with ten\r\nmeshes to the inch, and yet the limestone gave decidedly better results\r\nthan the burned lime, and it is not nearly so disagreeable to handle.\r\nBesides this, the ground limestone is much less expensive. It can be\r\nobtained at most points in Illinois for about a dollar and fifty cents a\r\nton.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dollar and fifty cents a ton!\" exclaimed Mr. Thornton. \"Well, that is\r\ncheap, but how about the freight and the barrels and bags? Freight is a\r\nbig item with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dollar and fifty cents includes the freight,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Includes the cost and the freight both?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the Illinois farmers have it shipped in bulk, so there is no\r\nexpense for barrels or bags. Of course the supplies of both coal and\r\nlimestone are very abundant, and with a well-equipped plant the actual\r\ncost of grinding does not exceed twenty-five cents a ton. The original\r\ncost of the material ground and on board cars at the works varies from\r\nabout sixty cents to one dollar a ton, and this leaves a very fair\r\nmargin of profit.\r\n\r\n\"The men who furnish the ground limestone realize that very large\r\nquantities of it are needed if the soils of Illinois are to be kept\r\nfertile, and they also realize that the ultimate prosperity of the\r\ncountry depends upon agricultural prosperity. Their far-sightedness and\r\npatriotism combine to lead them to try to sell carloads of limestone\r\ninstead of tons of burned lime. As a matter of fact five or ten dollars\r\nprofit on a car of limestone, the use of which in large quantities is\r\nthus made possible in systems of positive soil improvement, is very much\r\nbetter for all concerned than a profit of half that much on a single ton\r\nof burned lime which is used as a soil stimulant in systems of soil\r\nexhaustion.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly true,\" said Mr. Thornton, \"that all other great\r\nindustries depend upon agriculture, directly or indirectly. I have\r\nthought of it many times. It seems to me that fishing is about the only\r\nexception of importance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton requested that Percy remain for lunch in order that they\r\nmight return to the field to let him see the soil acidity tests made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nWHY PERCY WENT TO COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I AM interested to know where you learned these things about acid\r\nsoils and lime and limestone,\" said Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Mostly in the agricultural college,\" replied Percy, \"but much of\r\nthe information really comes from the investigations that are\r\nconducted by the experiment stations. For example, the best\r\ninformation the world affords concerning the comparative value of\r\nburned lime and ground limestone is furnished by the Pennsylvania\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station. Those experiments have been carried\r\non continuously since 1882, and the results of twenty years' careful\r\ninvestigations have recently been published. A four-year rotation of\r\ncrops was practiced, including corn, oats, wheat, and hay, the hay\r\nbeing clover and timothy mixed. With every crop the limestone has\r\ngiven better results than the burned lime. In fact the burned lime\r\nseems to have produced injurious results of late years, and the\r\nanalysis of the soil shows that there has been large loss of humus\r\nand nitrogen where the burned lime has been used, the actual loss\r\nbeing equivalent to the destruction of more than two tons of farm\r\nmanure per acre per annum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we surely need this information,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"I have\r\nalways supposed that the teachers in the agricultural college knew\r\nlittle or nothing of practical farming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not go to college to learn practical farming, if we mean by\r\nthat the common practice of agriculture,\" replied Percy. \"I already\r\nknew what we call practical farming; that is, how to do the ordinary\r\nfarm work, including such operations as plowing, planting,\r\ncultivating, and harvesting; but it seems to me, Mr. Thornton, that\r\nthis sort of practical farming has resulted in practical ruin for\r\nmost of these Eastern lands. The fact is there is a side to\r\nagriculture that I knew almost nothing about as a so-called\r\npractical farmer, and I am coming to believe that what we commonly\r\ncall practical farming is often the most impractical\r\nfarming,--certainly this is true if it ultimately results in\r\ndepleted and abandoned lands. The truly practical farmer is the man\r\nwho knows not only how to do, but also what to do and why he does\r\nit. The Simplon railroad tunnel connecting Switzerland with Italy is\r\ntwelve miles long,--the longest in the world. It was dug from the\r\ntwo ends, but under the mountain, six miles from either end, the two\r\nholes came together exactly, within a limit of error of less than\r\nsix inches, and made one continuous tunnel twelve miles long. Now,\r\nthis was not all accomplished by the practical men who knew how to\r\nhandle a spade in digging a ditch. The work was controlled by\r\nscience, and it was known in advance what the results would be. I do\r\nnot mean that it was known how hard the digging would be, nor how\r\nmuch trouble would be caused by caving or by water; but it was known\r\nthat if the practical work was done, the final outcome would be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is even more important that we understand enough of the\r\nsciences which underlie the practice of agriculture so we may know\r\nin advance that when the practical farm work is done the soil will\r\nbe richer and better rather than poorer and less productive because\r\nof our impractical farming.\r\n\r\n\"As I said, I did not go to the agricultural college to learn the\r\npractice or art of farming; I went to learn the science of\r\nagriculture; but, as a matter of fact, I found the college professor\r\nknew about as much of practical agriculture as I did and a great\r\ndeal of science that I did not know. I found that the Dean of the\r\ncollege, who is also Director of the Experiment Station, had been\r\nborn and raised on the farm, had done all kinds of farm work, the\r\nsame as other farm boys, had gone through an agricultural college,\r\nand after his graduation had returned to the farm and remained there\r\nfor ten years doing his own work with his own hands. He has had as\r\nmuch actual farm experience as you have had, Mr. Thornton, and ten\r\nyears more than I have had. He was finally called from the farm to\r\nbecome an assistant in the college from which he was graduated, and\r\nin a few years he was advanced to head professor in agriculture.\r\nAbout ten years ago he was made dean and director of the\r\nagricultural college and experiment station in my own state; and I\r\nhave been told that he will not recommend any one for a responsible\r\nposition in an agricultural college unless he has had both farm\r\nexperience and scientific training. He and most of his associates\r\nare owners of farms and would return to them again if they did not\r\nfeel that they are of more service to agriculture as teachers and\r\ninvestigators.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to know about this,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"Certainly\r\nyour opinion, based upon such knowledge as you have of your own\r\ncollege, is worth more than all the common talk I have ever heard\r\nfrom those who never saw an agricultural college. I wish you would\r\ntell me something more in regard to what crops are made of and about\r\nthe methods of making land better even while we are taking crops\r\nfrom it every year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA LESSON IN FARM SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE subject is somewhat complicated,\" Percy replied, \"yet it\r\ninvolves no more difficult problems than have been solved in many\r\nother lines. The chief trouble is that we have done too little\r\nthinking about our own real problems. Even in the country schools we\r\nhave learned something of banking and various other lines of\r\nbusiness, something of the history and politics of this and other\r\ncountries, something of the great achievements in war, in discovery\r\nand exploration, in art, literature, and invention; but we have not\r\nlearned what our soils contain nor what our crops require. Not one\r\nfarmer in a hundred knows what chemical elements are absolutely\r\nrequired for the production of our agricultural plants, and one may\r\nwork hard on the farm from four o'clock in the morning till nine\r\no'clock at night for forty years and still not learn what corn is\r\nmade of.\r\n\r\n\"All agricultural plants are composed of ten chemical elements, and\r\nthe growth of any crop is absolutely dependent upon the supply of\r\nthese plant food elements. If the supply of any one of these plant\r\nfood elements is limited, the crop yield will also be limited. The\r\ngrain and grass crops, such as corn, oats, wheat, and timothy, also\r\nthe root crops and potatoes, secure two elements from the air, one\r\nfrom water, and seven from the soil.\r\n\r\n\"The supply of some elements is constantly renewed by natural\r\nprocesses, and iron, one of the ten, is contained in all normal\r\nsoils in absolutely inexhaustible amount; while other elements\r\nbecome deficient and the supply must be renewed by man, or crop\r\nyields decrease and farming becomes unprofitable.\r\n\r\n\"Matter is absolutely indestructible. It may change its form, but\r\nnot a pound of material substance can be destroyed. Matter moves in\r\ncycles, and the key to the problem of successful permanent\r\nagriculture is the circulation of plant food. While some elements\r\nhave a natural cycle which is amply sufficient to meet all\r\nrequirements for these elements as plant food, other elements have\r\nno such cycle, and it is the chief business of the farmer to make\r\nthese elements circulate.\r\n\r\n\"Take carbon, for example. This element is well represented by hard\r\ncoal. Soft coal and charcoal are chiefly carbon. The diamond is pure\r\ncrystallized carbon, and charcoal made from pure sugar is pure,\r\nuncrystallized carbon. This can easily be made by heating a lump of\r\nsugar on a red hot stove until only a black coal remains. Now these\r\ndifferent solid materials represent carbon in the elemental form or\r\nfree state. But carbon may unite with other elements to form\r\nchemical compounds, and these may be solids, liquids, gases.\r\n\r\n\"Thus carbon and sulfur are both solid elements, one black and the\r\nother yellow, as generally found. If these two elements are mixed\r\ntogether under ordinary conditions no change occurs. The result is\r\nsimply a mixture of carbon and sulfur. But, if this mixture is\r\nheated in a retort which excludes the air, the carbon and sulfur\r\nunite into a chemical compound called carbon disulfid. This compound\r\nis neither black, yellow, nor solid; but it is a colorless, limpid\r\nliquid; and yet it contains absolutely nothing except carbon and\r\nsulfur.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems strange,\" remarked Mr. Thornton. \"Yes, but similar\r\nchanges are going on about us all the time,\" replied Percy. \"We put\r\nten pounds of solid black coal in the stove and an hour later we\r\nfind nothing there, except a few ounces of ashes which represent the\r\nimpurities in the coal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the coal is burned up and destroyed, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"The carbon is burned and changed, but not destroyed. In this case,\r\nthe heat has caused the carbon to unite with the element oxygen\r\nwhich exists in the air in the form of a gas, and a chemical\r\ncompound is formed which we call carbon dioxid. This compound is a\r\ncolorless gas. This element oxygen enters the vent of the stove and\r\nthe compound carbon dioxid passes off through the chimney. If there\r\nis any smoke, it is due to small particles of unburned carbon or\r\nother colored substances.\r\n\r\n\"As a rule more or less sulfur is contained in coal, wood, and other\r\norganic matter, and this also is burned to sulfur dioxid and carried\r\ninto the air, from which it is brought back to the soil in rain in\r\nample amounts to supply all of the sulfur required by plants.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere over the earth the atmosphere contains some carbon\r\ndioxid and this compound furnishes all agricultural plants their\r\nnecessary supply of both carbon and oxygen. In other words, these\r\nare the two elements that plants secure from the air. The gas,\r\ncarbon dioxid, passes into the plant through the breathing pores on\r\nthe under side of the leaves. These are microscopic openings but\r\nvery numerous. A square inch of a corn leaf may have a hundred\r\nthousand breathing pores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, as we go on, I am especially anxious to get at this question\r\nof supply and demand,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"I think I understand\r\nabout iron and sulfur, and also that these two elements, carbon and\r\noxygen, are both contained in the air in the compound called carbon\r\ndioxid, and that this must supply our crops with those two elements\r\nof plant food. I'd like to know about the supply. How much is there\r\nin the air and how much do the crops require?\"\r\n\r\n\"As you know,\" said Percy, \"the atmospheric pressure is about\r\nfifteen pounds to the square inch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I've heard that, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that means, of course, that there are fifteen pounds of air\r\nresting on every square inch of the earth's surface; in other words,\r\nthat a column of air one inch square and as high as the air goes,\r\nperhaps fifty miles or more, weighs fifteen pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is very clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one pound of carbon in ten thousand pounds of\r\nordinary country air. Now, there are one hundred and sixty square\r\nrods in an acre, and since there are twelve inches in a foot and\r\nsixteen and one-half feet in a rod, it is easy to compute that there\r\nare nearly a hundred million pounds of air on an acre, and that the\r\ncarbon in this amounts to only five tons. A three-ton crop of corn\r\nor hay contains one and one-fourth tons of the element carbon; so\r\nthat the total amount of the carbon in the air over an acre of land\r\nis sufficient for only four such crops; while a single crop of corn\r\nyielding a hundred bushels to the acre, such as we often raise in\r\nIllinois on old feed-lots or other pieces of well treated land would\r\nrequire half of the total supply of carbon contained in the air over\r\nan acre. However, the largest crop of corn ever grown, of which\r\nthere is an established authentic record, was not raised in\r\nIllinois, but in the state of South Carolina, in the county of\r\nMarlborough, in the year 1898, by Z. J. Drake; and, according to the\r\nauthentic report of the official committee that measured the land\r\nand saw the crop harvested and weighed, and awarded Drake a prize of\r\nfive hundred dollars given by the Orange Judd Publishing\r\nCompany,--according to this very creditable evidence, that acre of\r\nland yielded 239 bushels of thoroughly aid-dried corn; and such a\r\ncrop, Mr. Thornton, would require as much carbon as the total amount\r\ncontained in the air over an acre of land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is astonishing! Then there must be some other source of\r\nsupply besides the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no other direct source from which plants secure carbon;\r\nbut of course the air is in constant motion. Only one-fourth of the\r\nearth's surface is land, and perhaps only one-fourth of this land is\r\ncropped, and the average crop is about one-fourth of three tons; so\r\nthat the total present supply of carbon in the air would be\r\nsufficient for about two hundred and fifty years. But as a matter of\r\nfact the supply is permanently maintained by the carbon cycle. Thus\r\nthe carbon of coal that is burned in the stove returns to the air in\r\ncarbon dioxid; and all combustion of coal and wood, grass and weeds,\r\nand all other vegetable matter returns carbon to the atmosphere. All\r\ndecay of organic matter, as in the fermentation of manure in the\r\npile and the rotting of vegetable matter in the soil, is a form of\r\nslow combustion and carbon dioxid is the chief produce of such\r\ndecay. Sometimes an appreciable amount of heat is developed, as in\r\nthe steaming pile of stable refuse lying in the barnyard, while the\r\nheat evolved in the soil is too quickly disseminated to be apparent.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to all this, every animal exhales carbon dioxid. The\r\nbody heat and the animal force or energy are supplied by the\r\ncombustion of organic food within the body, and here, too, carbon\r\ndioxid is the chief product of combustion.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, as a general average, the amount of carbon removed from the\r\natmosphere by growing plants is no greater than the amount returned\r\nto the air by these various forms of combustion or decay. In like\r\nmanner the supply of combined oxygen is maintained, both carbon and\r\noxygen being furnished to the plant m the carbon dioxid.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of fact, the air consists very largely of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen, both in the free state, but in this form these elements\r\ncannot be utilized in the growth of agricultural plants. The only\r\napparent exception to this is in case of legume crops, such as\r\nclover, alfalfa, peas, beans, and vetch, which have power to utilize\r\nthe free nitrogen by means of their symbiotic relationship with\r\ncertain nitrogen-fixing bacteria which live, or may live, in\r\ntubercles on their roots.\r\n\r\n\"Carbon and oxygen constitute about ninety per cent. of the dry\r\nmatter of ordinary farm crops, and with the addition of hydrogen\r\nvery important plant constituents are produced; such as starch,\r\nsugar, fiber, or cellulose, which constitute the carbohydrate group.\r\nAs the name indicates, this group contains carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen, the last two being present in the same proportion as in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Water is composed of the two elements, hydrogen and oxygen, both of\r\nwhich are gases in the free state. Water is taken into the plant\r\nthrough the roots and decomposed in the leaves in contact with the\r\ncarbon dioxid under the influence of sunlight and the life\r\nprinciple. The oxygen from the water and part of that from the\r\ncarbon dioxid is given off into the air through the breathing pores,\r\nwhile the carbon, hydrogen, and part of the oxygen, unite to form\r\nthe carbohydrates. These three elements constitute about ninety-five\r\nper cent. of our farm crops, and yet every one of the other seven\r\nplant food elements is just as essential to the growth and full\r\ndevelopment of the plant as are these three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then so long as we have air above and moisture below, our crops\r\nwill not lack for carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Is that the summing\r\nup of the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" Percy replied.\r\n\r\n\"And those three elements make up ninety-five per cent. of our farm\r\ncrops. Is that correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir, as an average.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now it seems to me, if nature thus provides ninety-five per\r\ncent. of all we need, we ought to find some way of furnishing the\r\nother five per cent. It makes me think of the young wife who told\r\nher husband she could live on bread and water, with his love, and he\r\ntold her that if she would furnish the bread he'd skirmish around\r\nand get the water. But, say, did that South Carolina man use any\r\nfertilizer for that immense crop of corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some fertilizer, yes. He applied manure and fertilizer from\r\nFebruary till June. In all he applied 1000 bushels (about 30 tons)\r\nof farm manure, 600 bushels of whole cotton seed, 900 pounds of\r\ncotton seed meal, 900 pounds of kainit, 1100 pounds of guano, 200\r\npounds of bone meal, 200 pounds of acid phosphate, and 400 pounds of\r\nsodium nitrate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would also like to know the facts about this nitrogen business,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Thornton. \"I've understood that one could get some of it\r\nfrom the air, and I would much rather get it that way than to buy it\r\nfrom the fertilizer agent at twenty cents a pound. Cowpeas don't\r\nseem to help much, and we don't have the cotton seed, and we never\r\nhave sufficient manure to cover much land.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a remarkable fact,\" said Percy, \"that of the ten essential\r\nelements of plant food, nitrogen is the most abundant, measured by\r\ncrop requirements, and at the same time the most expensive. The air\r\nabove an acre of land contains enough carbon for a hundred bushels\r\nof corn per acre for two years, and enough nitrogen for five hundred\r\nthousand years; and yet the nitrogen in commercial fertilizers costs\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty cents a pound. At commercial prices for\r\nnitrogen, every man who owns an acre of land is a millionaire.\r\n\r\n\"You mean he has millions in the air,\" amended Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the better way to put it,\" Percy admitted, \"but the\r\nfact is he can not only get this nitrogen for nothing by means of\r\nlegume crops, but he is paid for getting it, because those crops are\r\nprofitable to raise for their own value. Clover, alfalfa, cowpeas,\r\nand soy beans are all profitable crops, and they all have power to\r\nuse the free nitrogen of the air.\r\n\r\n\"There are a few important facts to be kept in mind regarding\r\nnitrogen:\r\n\r\n\"A fifty-bushel crop of corn takes 75 pounds of nitrogen from the\r\nsoil. Of this amount about 50 pounds are in the grain, 24 pounds are\r\nin the stalks, and 1 pound in the cobs. A fifty-bushel crop of oats\r\ntakes 48 pounds of nitrogen from the soil, 33 pounds in the grain,\r\nand 15 in the straw. A twenty-five bushel crop of wheat also takes\r\n48 pounds of nitrogen from the soil, 36 pounds in the grain and 12\r\nin the straw.\r\n\r\n\"These amounts will vary to some extent with the quality of the\r\ncrops, just as the weight of a bushel of wheat varies from perhaps\r\n56 to 64 pounds, although as an average wheat weighs 60 pounds to\r\nthe bushel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely remember figures well,\" remarked Mr. Thornton as he made\r\nsome notations.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to remember what we think about much and often,\" said\r\nPercy; \"as easy to remember that a ton of cowpea hay contains 43\r\npounds of nitrogen as that Blairville is 53 miles from Richmond.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have added those figures together,\" continued Mr. Thornton, \"and\r\nI find that the three crops, corn, oats, and wheat, would require\r\n171 pounds of nitrogen. Now suppose we raise a crop of cowpeas the\r\nfourth year, how much nitrogen would be added to the soil in the\r\nroots and stubble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that the roots and stubble of the cowpeas would\r\nadd no nitrogen to the soil? Surely that does not agree with the\r\ncommon talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is even worse than that,\" said Percy. \"The cowpea roots and\r\nstubble would contain less nitrogen than the cowpea crop takes from\r\na soil capable of yielding thirty bushels of corn or oats. Only\r\nabout one-tenth of the nitrogen contained in the cowpea plant is\r\nleft in the roots and stubble when the crop is harvested. Suppose\r\nthe yield is two tons per acre of cowpea hay! Such a crop would\r\ncontain about 86 pounds of nitrogen, and about 10 pounds of nitrogen\r\nper acre would be left in the roots and stubble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that wouldn't go far toward replacing the 171 pounds removed\r\nfrom the soil by the corn, oats, and wheat, that's sure,\" was Mr.\r\nThornton's comment.\r\n\r\n\"It is worse than that,\" Percy repeated. \"Land that will furnish 48\r\npounds of nitrogen for a crop of oats or wheat will furnish more\r\nthan 10 pounds for a crop of cowpeas. At the end of such a four-year\r\nrotation such a soil would be about 200 pounds poorer in nitrogen\r\nper acre than at the beginning, if all crops were removed and\r\nnothing returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much would it cost to put that nitrogen back in commercial\r\nfertilizer?\" asked Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"That depends, of course, upon what kind of fertilizer is used.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, most people around here who use fertilizer buy what the agent\r\ncalls two-eight-two, and its costs about one dollar and fifty cents\r\na hundred pounds; but it can be bought by the ton for about\r\ntwenty-five dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Two-eight-two' means that the fertilizer is guaranteed to contain\r\ntwo per cent. of ammonia, eight per cent. of available 'phosphoric\r\nacid,' and two per cent. of potash.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ammonia is the same as nitrogen, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not the same,\" replied Percy. \"Ammonia is a compound of\r\nnitrogen and hydrogen. In order to have a clear understanding of the\r\nrelation between ammonia and nitrogen we only need to know the\r\ncombining weights of the elements. The smallest particle of an\r\nelement is called an atom. Hydrogen is the lightest of all the\r\nelements and the weight of the hydrogen atom is used as the standard\r\nor unit for the measure of all other atomic weights; thus the atom\r\nof hydrogen weighs one.\"\r\n\r\n\"One what?\" interrupted Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"No one knows,\" replied Percy. \"The atom is extremely small, much\r\ntoo small to be seen with the most powerful microscope; but you know\r\nall things are relative and we always measure one thing in terms of\r\nanother. We say a foot is twelve inches and an inch is one-twelfth\r\nof a foot, and there we stop with a definition of each expressed in\r\nterms of the other, and both depending upon an arbitrary standard\r\nthat somebody once adopted; and yet, while the foot is known in most\r\ncountries, it is rare that two countries have exactly the same\r\nstandard for this measure of length.\r\n\r\n\"We do not know the exact weight of the hydrogen atom, but we do\r\nknow its relative weight. If the hydrogen atom weighs one then other\r\natomic weights are as follows:\r\n\r\n12 for carbon\r\n14 for nitrogen\r\n16 for oxygen\r\n24 for magnesium\r\n31 for phosphorus\r\n32 for sulfur\r\n39 for potassium\r\n40 for calcium\r\n56 for iron\r\n\r\n\"This means that the iron atom is fifty-six times as heavy as the\r\nhydrogen atom. These atomic weights are absolutely necessary to a\r\nclear understanding of the compounds formed by the union or\r\ncombination of two or more elements.\r\n\r\n\"One other thing is also necessary. That is to keep in mind the\r\nnumber of bonds, or hands, possessed by each atom. The atom of\r\nhydrogen has only one hand, and the same is true of potassium. Each\r\natom of oxygen has two hands; so that one oxygen atom can hold two\r\nhydrogen atoms in the chemical compound called water (H-O-H or H20).\r\nOther elements having two-handed atoms are magnesium and calcium.\r\nStrange to say, the sulfur atom has six hands but sometimes uses\r\nonly two, the others seemingly being clasped together in pairs. I\r\nwill write it out for you, thus:\r\n\r\nHydrogen sulfid: H-S-H or H2S\r\n\r\nSulfur dioxid: O=S=0 or S02\r\n\r\n\"The carbon atom has four hands, and atoms of nitrogen and\r\nphosphorus have five hands, but sometimes use only three. Thus, in\r\nthe compound called ammonia, one atom of nitrogen always holds three\r\natoms of hydrogen; so, if you buy seventeen pounds of ammonia you\r\nwould get only fourteen pounds of nitrogen and three pounds of\r\nhydrogen. This means that, if the two-eight-two fertilizer contains\r\ntwo per cent. of ammonia, it contains only one and two-thirds per\r\ncent. of the actual element nitrogen, and a ton of such fertilizer\r\nwould contain thirty-three pounds of nitrogen. In other words it\r\nwould take six tons of such fertilizer to replace the nitrogen\r\nremoved from one acre of land in four years if the crop yields were\r\nfifty bushels of corn and oats, twenty-five bushels of wheat, and\r\ntwo tons of cowpea hay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Six tons! Why, that would cost a hundred and fifty dollars! Well,\r\nwell, I thought I knew we couldn't afford to keep up our land with\r\ncommercial fertilizer; but I didn't think it was that bad. Almost\r\nforty dollars an acre a year!\"\r\n\r\n\"It need not be quite that bad,\" said Percy. \"You see this\r\ntwo-eight-two fertilizer contains eight per cent. of so-called\r\n'phosphoric acid' and two per cent. of potash, and those\r\nconstituents may be worth much more than the nitrogen; but, so far\r\nas nitrogen is concerned, the two hundred pounds would cost from\r\nthirty to forty dollars in the best nitrogen fertilizers in the\r\nmarket, such as dried blood or sodium nitrate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, even that would be eight or ten dollars a year per acre, and\r\nthat is as much as the land is worth, and this wouldn't include any\r\nother plant food elements, such as 'phosphoric acid' and potash.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that much would be required for the nitrogen alone if bought in\r\ncommercial form. I understand that the farmers who use this common\r\ncommercial fertilizer, apply about three hundred pounds of it to the\r\nacre perhaps twice in four years. That would cost about eight\r\ndollars for the four years, and the total nitrogen applied in the\r\ntwo applications would amount to 10 pounds per acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not quite correct to call 'phosphoric acid' and potash plant\r\nfood elements. They are not elements but compounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like ammonia, which is part nitrogen and part hydrogen?\"\r\n\r\n\"The problem is somewhat similar, but not just the same,\" Percy\r\nreplied. \"These compounds contain oxygen and not hydrogen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I understand that both oxygen and hydrogen are furnished by\r\nnatural processes, the oxygen from carbon dioxid in the carbon\r\ncycle, and the hydrogen from the water which falls in rain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all true, but you really do not buy the hydrogen or oxygen.\r\nWhile they are included in the two-eight-two guarantee, the price is\r\nadjusted for that. Thus the cost of nitrogen would be just the same\r\nwhether you purchase the fertilizer on the basis of seventeen cents\r\na pound for the actual element nitrogen, or fourteen cents a pound\r\nfor the ammonia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see how that might be, but I don't see why the guarantee\r\nshould be two per cent. of ammonia instead of one and two-thirds per\r\ncent. of nitrogen, when the nitrogen is all that gives it value.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no good reason for it,\" said Percy. \"It is one of those\r\ncustoms that are conceived in ignorance and continued in\r\nselfishness. It is very much simpler to consider the whole subject\r\non the basis of actual plant food elements, and I am glad to say\r\nthat many of the state laws already require the nitrogen to be\r\nguaranteed in terms of the actual element, a few states now require\r\nthe phosphorus and potassium also to be reported on the element\r\nbasis.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is hopeful, at least,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"Now, if I am not\r\nasking too many questions or keeping you here too long, I shall be\r\nglad to have you explain two more points that come to my mind:\r\nFirst, how much of that two hundred pounds of nitrogen can I put\r\nback in the manure produced on the farm; and, second, just what is\r\nmeant by potash and phosphoric acid?\"\r\n\r\nPercy made a few computations and then replied: \"If you sell the\r\nwheat; feed all the corn, oats, and cowpea hay and half of the straw\r\nand corn fodder, and use the other half for bedding; and, if you\r\nsave absolutely all of the manure produced, including both the solid\r\nand liquid excrement; then it would be possible to recover and\r\nreturn to the land about 173 pounds of nitrogen during the four\r\nyears, compared with the 200 pounds taken from the soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't understand that,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"How can that be when\r\none of the crops is cowpeas?\"\r\n\r\n\"In average live-stock and dairy farming,\" Percy continued, \"about\r\none-fourth of the nitrogen contained in the food consumed is\r\nretained in the milk and animal growth, and you can make the\r\ncomputations for yourself. It should be kept in mind, moreover, that\r\nmuch of the manure produced on the average farm is wasted. More than\r\nhalf of the nitrogen is in the liquid excrement, and it is extremely\r\ndifficult to prevent loss of the liquid manure. There is also large\r\nloss of nitrogen from the fermentation of manure in piles; and when\r\nyou smell ammonia in the stable, see the manure pile steaming, or\r\ncolored liquid soaking into the ground beneath, or flowing away in\r\nrainy weather, you may know that nitrogen is being lost. How many\r\ntons of manure can you apply to your land under such a system of\r\nfarming as we have been discussing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've figured a good deal on manure,\" was the reply, \"and I\r\nthink with four fields producing such crops as you counted on, that\r\nI could possibly put ten or twelve tons to the acre on one field\r\nevery year.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would return from 100 to 120 pounds of nitrogen;\" said Percy,\r\n\"instead of the 173 pounds possible to be returned if there is no\r\nloss. There are three methods that may be used to reduce the loss of\r\nmanure: One of these is to do the feeding on the fields. Another is\r\nto haul the manure from the stable every day or two and spread it on\r\nthe land. The third is to allow the manure to accumulate in deep\r\nstalls for several weeks, using plenty of bedding to absorb the\r\nliquid and keep the animals clean, and then haul and spread it when\r\nconvenient.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid that last method would not do at all for the dairy\r\nfarmer,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"You see we have to keep things very\r\nclean and in sanitary condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most often the cleanest and most sanitary method the average farmer\r\nhas of handling the manure in dairying,\" said Percy, \"is to keep it\r\nburied as much as possible under plenty of clean bedding; and one of\r\nthe worst methods is to overhaul it every day by 'cleaning' the\r\nstable, unless you could have concrete floors throughout, and flush\r\nthem well once or twice a day, thus losing a considerable part of\r\nthe valuable excrement. If you allow the manure to accumulate for\r\nseveral weeks at a time, it is best to have sufficient room in the\r\nstable or shed so that the cows need not be tied. If allowed to run\r\nloose they will find clean places to lie down even during the night.\r\n\r\n\"In case of horses, the manure can be kept buried for several weeks\r\nif some means are used to prevent the escape of ammonia. Cattle\r\nproduce what is called a 'cold' manure, while it is called 'hot'\r\nfrom horses because it decomposes so readily. One of the best\r\nsubstances to use for the prevention of loss of ammonia in horse\r\nstables is acid phosphate, which has power to unite with ammonia and\r\nhold it in a fixed compound. About one pound of acid phosphate per\r\nday for each horse should be sprinkled over the manure. Of course\r\nthe phosphorus contained in the acid phosphate has considerable\r\nvalue for its own sake, and care should be taken that you do not\r\nlose more phosphorus from the acid phosphate applied than the value\r\nof all the ammonia saved by this means. Porous earth floors may\r\nabsorb very considerable amounts of liquid from wet manure lying\r\nunderneath the dry bedding, and the acid phosphate sometimes injures\r\nthe horses' feet; so that, as a rule, it is better to clean the\r\nhorse stables every day and supply phosphorus in raw phosphate at\r\none-fourth of its cost in acid phosphate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before we leave the nitrogen question,\" said Mr. Thornton, \"I want\r\nto ask if you can suggest how we can get enough of the several\r\nmillion dollars' worth we have in the air to supply the needs of our\r\ncrops and build up our land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grow more legumes, and plow more under, either directly or in\r\nmanure.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds easy, but can you suggest some practical system?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. I know too little of your conditions to think I could\r\nsuggest the best system for you to adopt; but I can surely suggest\r\none that will supply nitrogen for such crop yields as we have\r\nconsidered: Suppose we change the order of the crops and grow wheat,\r\ncorn, oats, and cowpeas, and grow clover with the wheat and oats,\r\nplowing the clover under in the spring as green manure for corn and\r\ncowpeas. If necessary to prevent the clover or weeds from producing\r\nseed, the field may be clipped with the mower in the late summer\r\nwhen the clover has made some growth after the wheat and oats have\r\nbeen removed. Leave this season's growth lying on the land. As an\r\naverage it should amount to more than half a ton of hay per acre.\r\nThe next spring the clover is allowed to grow for several weeks. It\r\nshould be plowed under for corn on one field early in May and two or\r\nthree weeks later the other field is plowed for cowpeas. The spring\r\ngrowth should average nearly a ton of clover hay per acre. In this\r\nway clover equivalent to about three tons of hay could be plowed\r\nunder. Clover hay contains 40 pounds of nitrogen per ton; so this\r\nwould supply about 120 pounds of nitrogen in addition to the 173\r\npounds possible to be supplied in the manure. This would make\r\npossible a total return of 293 pounds, while we figured some 200\r\npounds removed. Of course if you save only 100 pounds in the manure\r\nthe amount returned would be reduced to 220 pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two questionable points in this plan,\" said Mr. Thornton,\r\n\" one is the impossibility, or at least the difficulty, of growing\r\nclover on this land. The other point is, How much of that 120 pounds\r\nof nitrogen returned in the clover is taken from the soil itself? I\r\nremember you figured 86 pounds of nitrogen in two tons of cowpea\r\nhay, but you also assumed that about 29 pounds of it would be taken\r\nfrom the soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is true,\" Percy replied, \"at least 29 pounds and\r\nprobably more. You see the cowpeas grow during the same months as\r\ncorn and on land prepared in about the same manner. If the soil will\r\nfurnish 75 pounds of nitrogen to the corn crop, and 48 pounds to the\r\noats and wheat, it would surely furnish 29 pounds to the cowpeas. Of\r\ncourse this particular amount has no special significance, but the\r\nother definite amounts removed in corn, oats, and wheat aggregate\r\n171 and the 29 pounds were added to make the round 200 pounds.\r\nPerhaps 210 pounds would be nearer the truth, in which case the soil\r\nwould furnish about half as much nitrogen to the cowpea crop as to\r\nthe corn crop. This is reasonable considering that corn is the first\r\ncrop grown after the manure is applied. You will remember that only\r\none-tenth of the total nitrogen of the cowpea plant remains in the\r\nroots and stubble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what we figured on.\"\r\n\r\n\"The cowpea is an annual plant. It is planted, produces its seed,\r\nand dies the same season. It has no need to store up material in the\r\nroots for future use. Consequently the substance of the root is\r\nlargely taken into the tops as the plan approaches maturity. It is\r\ndifferent with the clover plant. This is a biennial with some\r\ntendency toward the perennial plant. It lives long and develops an\r\nextensive root system, and its stores up material in the roots\r\nduring part of its life for use at a later period. About one-third\r\nof the total nitrogen content of the clover plant is contained in\r\nthe roots and stubble. This means that the roots and stubble of a\r\ntwo-ton crop of clover would contain about forty pounds of nitrogen,\r\nor more than we assumed was taken from the soil by the cowpeas. But\r\nthere is still another point in favor of the clover. The cowpeas\r\nmake their growth during the summer months when nitrification is\r\nmost active, whereas the clover growth we have counted on occurs\r\nchiefly during the fall and spring when nitrification is much less\r\nactive, consequently the clover probably takes even a larger\r\nproportion of its nitrogen from the air than we have counted on.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is rather confusing,\" said Mr. Thornton, \"you say the cowpea\r\ngrows when nitrification is most active, and yet you say that it\r\ntakes less nitrogen from the air than clover. Isn't that somewhat\r\ncontradictory?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" said Percy.\" Let me see.--Just what do you understand\r\nby nitrification?\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting nitrogen from the air, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. That explains it. Getting nitrogen from the air is called\r\nnitrogen fixation. This action is carried on by the nitrogen-fixing\r\nbacteria, such as the clover bacteria, the soy bean bacteria, the\r\nalfalfa bacteria, which, by the way, are evidently the same as the\r\nbacteria of sweet clover, or mellilotus. Then we also have the\r\ncowpea bacteria, and these seem to be the same as the bacteria of\r\nthe wild partridge pea, a kind of sensitive plant with yellow\r\nflowers, and a tiny goblet standing upright at the base of each\r\ncompound leaf,--the plant called Cassia Chamaecrista by the\r\nbotanist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nitrification is an altogether--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare! Excuse me, Sir, but that's Charlie calling the\r\ncows. Scotts, I don't see where the time has gone! You'll excuse me,\r\nSir, but I must look after separating the cream. You will greatly\r\noblige me, Mr. Johnston, if you will have dinner with us and share\r\nour home to-night. In addition to the pleasure of your company, I\r\nconfess that I am mightily interested in this subject; and I would\r\nlike especially to get a clear understanding of that nitrification\r\nprocess, and we've not had time to discuss the potash and\r\n'phosphoric acid,' which I know cost some of our farmers a good part\r\nof all they get for their crops, and still their lands are as poor\r\nas ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate very much your kind invitation, Mr. Thornton. I came\r\nto you for correct information regarding the agricultural conditions\r\nhere, and you were very kind and indulgent to answer my blunt\r\nquestions, even concerning your own farm practice and experience. I\r\nfeel, Sir, that I am already greatly indebted to you, but it will\r\ncertainly be a great pleasure to me to remain with you to-night.\"\r\n\r\nFor more than two hours they had been standing, leaning, or sitting\r\nin a field beside a shock of cowpea hay, Percy toying with his soil\r\nauger, and Mr. Thornton making records now and then in his pocket\r\nnote book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCOEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY took a lesson in turning the cream separator and after dinner\r\nMrs. Thornton assured him that she and her sister were greatly\r\ndisappointed that they had not been permitted to hear the discussion\r\nconcerning the use of science on the farm.\r\n\r\n\"We have never forsaken our belief that these old farms can again be\r\nmade to yield bountiful crops,\" she said, \"as ours did for so many\r\nyears under the management of our ancestors. 'Hope springs eternal\r\nin the human breast.' I stop with that for I do not like the rest of\r\nthe couplet. We can see that some marked progress has been made\r\nunder my husband's management, although he feels that it is very\r\nslow work building up a run-down farm. But he has raised some fine\r\ncrops on the fields under cultivation,--as much as ten barrels of\r\ncorn to the acre, have you not, Dear?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, fully that much, but even ten barrels per acre on one small\r\nfield is nothing compared to the great fields of corn Mr. Johnston\r\nraises in the West. and it makes a mighty small show here on a\r\nnine-hundred-acre farm, most of which hasn't been cropped for more\r\nthan twenty years; and even then it was given up because the negro\r\ntenants couldn't raise corn enough to live on.\r\n\r\n\"I've talked some with the fertilizer agents, but they don't know\r\nmuch about fertilizers, except what they read in the testimonials\r\npublished in the advertising booklets. I have had some good help\r\nfrom the agricultural papers, but most that is written for the\r\npapers doesn't apply to our farm, and it's so indefinite and\r\nincomplete, that I've just spent this whole evening asking Mr.\r\nJohnston questions; and I haven't given him a chance to answer them\r\nall yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you have not asked more questions this afternoon than I\r\ndid this forenoon,\" Percy remarked; \"and all your answers were based\r\non authentic history or actual experience, while my answers were\r\nonly what I have learned from others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we were more ready to learn from others, it would be\r\nbetter for all of us,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"Experience is a mighty\r\ndear teacher and, even if we finally learn the lesson, it may be too\r\neverlasting late for us to apply it. Now we all want to learn about\r\nthat process called nitrification.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an extremely interesting and important process,\" said Percy.\r\n\"It includes the stages or steps by which the insoluble organic\r\nnitrogen of the soil is converted into soluble nitrate nitrogen, in\r\nwhich form it become available as food for all of our agricultural\r\nplants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excepting the legumes?\" asked Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Excepting none,\" Percy replied. \"The legume plants, like clover,\r\ntake nitrogen from the soil so far as they can secure it in\r\navailable form, and in this respect clover is not different from\r\ncorn. The respect in which it is different is the power of clover to\r\nsecure additional supplies of nitrogen from the air when the soil's\r\navailable supply becomes inadequate to meet the needs of the growing\r\nclover. If the conditions are suitable for nitrogen-fixation, then\r\nthe growth of the legume plants need not be limited by lack of\r\nnitrogen; whereas, nitrogen is probably the element that first\r\nlimits the growth and yield of all other crops on your common\r\nsoils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, what do you think of that, Girls? With millions of dollars'\r\nworth of nitrogen in the air over every acre, our crops are poor\r\njust because we don't use it. I wish you would tell me something\r\nabout the suitable conditions for nitrogen-fixation, Mr. Johnston.\r\nYou understand, Girls, that nitrogen-fixation is simply getting\r\nnitrogen from the inexhaustible supply in the air by means of little\r\nmicroscopic organisms called bacteria, which live in little balls\r\ncalled tubercles attached to the roots of certain plants called\r\nlegumes, like cowpeas and clover. Corn and wheat and such crops\r\ncan't get this nitrogen. Now, Mr. Johnston is telling about\r\nnitrification, a process which is entirely different from\r\nnitrogen-fixation. Excuse me, Mr. Johnston, but I wanted to make\r\nthis plain to Mrs. Thornton and Miss Russell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you did so,\" Percy replied. \"As I was saying,\r\nnitrification has no connection whatever with the free nitrogen of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n\"All plants take their food in solution; that is, the plant food\r\ntaken from the soil must be dissolved in the soil water or moisture.\r\nOf the essential elements of plant food, seven are taken from the\r\nsoil through the roots into the plant. These seven do not include\r\nthose of which water itself is composed. Now, these seven plant food\r\nelements exist in the soil almost exclusively in an insoluble form.\r\nIn that condition they are not available to the plant for plant\r\nfood; and it is the business of the farmer to make this plant food\r\navailable as fast as is needed by his growing crops.\r\n\r\n\"The nitrogen of the soil exists in the organic matter; that is, in\r\nsuch materials as plant roots, weeds, and stubble, that may have\r\nbeen plowed under, or any kind of vegetable maker incorporated with\r\nthe soil, including all sorts of crop residues, green manures, and\r\nthe common farm fertilizers from the stables. When these organic\r\nmaterials are decomposed and disintegrated to such an extent that\r\ntheir structure is completely destroyed, the resulting mass of\r\npartially decayed black organic matter is called humus. The nitrogen\r\nof the soil is one of the constituents of this humus or other\r\norganic matter. It is not contained in the mineral particles of the\r\nsoil. On the other hand the other six elements of plant food are\r\ncontained largely in the mineral part of the soil, as the clay,\r\nsilt, and sand. thus the iron, calcium, magnesium, and potassium,\r\nall of which are called abundant elements, are contained in the\r\nmineral matter, and usually in considerable amounts, while they are\r\nfound in the organic matter in very small proportion. The phosphorus\r\nand sulfur are found in very limited quantities in most soils, but\r\nthey are present in both organic and mineral form.\r\n\r\n\"Practically the entire stock or store of all of the elements in the\r\nsoil is insoluble and consequently unavailable for the use of\r\ngrowing plants; and, as I said, some of the chief plans and efforts\r\nof the farmer should be directed to the business of making plant\r\nfood available.\r\n\r\n\"The nitrogen contained in the insoluble organic matter of the soil\r\nis made soluble and available by the process called nitrification.\r\nThree different kinds of bacteria are required to bring about the\r\ncomplete change.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are these bacteria different from the nitrogen fixing bacteria?\"\r\nasked Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Entirely different,\" Percy replied, \"and there are three distinct\r\nkinds, one for each of the three steps in the process.\r\n\r\n\"The first may be called ammonia bacteria. They have power to\r\nconvert organic nitrogen into ammonia nitrogen; that is, into the\r\ncompound of nitrogen and hydrogen; and this step in the process is\r\ncalled ammonification.\r\n\r\n\"The other two kinds are the true nitrifying bacteria. One of them\r\nconverts the ammonia into nitrites, and the other changes the\r\nnitrites into nitrates. These two kinds are known as the nitrite\r\nbacteria and the nitrate bacteria.\r\n\r\n\"Technically the last two steps in the process are nitrification\r\nproper; but, speaking generally, the term nitrification is used to\r\ninclude the three steps, or both ammonification and nitrification\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n\"Now, the nitrifying bacteria require certain conditions, otherwise\r\nthey will not perform their functions. Among these essential\r\nconditions are the presence of moisture and free oxygen, a supply of\r\ncarbonates, certain food materials for the bacteria themselves, and\r\na temperature within certain limits.\r\n\r\n\"You may remember, Mr. Thornton, that more soil nitrogen is made\r\navailable for cowpeas during the summer weather than for clover\r\nduring the cooler fall and spring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember that distinction.\"\r\n\r\n\"I declare,\" said Miss Russell, \"Tom talks as though he had been\r\nthere and seen the things going on. I haven't seen you using any\r\nmicroscope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I tell you, I've mighty near seen 'em,\" was the reply. \"Mr.\r\nJohnston makes everything so plain that I can mighty near see what\r\nhe saw when he looked through the microscope.\"\r\n\r\n\"I greatly enjoyed my microscopic work,\" said Percy, \"and still more\r\nthe work in the chemical laboratory where we finally learned to\r\nanalyze soils, to take them apart and see what they contain,--how\r\nmuch nitrogen how much phosphorus, how much limestone, or how much\r\nsoil acidity, which means that limestone is needed. Then I also\r\nenjoyed the work in the pot-culture laboratory, where we learned not\r\nto analyze but to synthesize; that is, to put different materials\r\ntogether to make a soil. Thus, we would make one soil and put in all\r\nof the essential plant food elements except nitrogen, and another\r\nwith only phosphorus lacking, and still another with both nitrogen\r\nand phosphorus present, and all of the other essential elements\r\nprovided, except potassium, or magnesium, or iron. These prepared\r\nsoils were put in glass jars having a hole in the bottom for\r\ndrainage, and then the same kind of seeds were planted in each jar\r\nor pot. Some students planted corn, others oats or wheat or any kind\r\nof farm seeds. I grew rape plants in one series of pots, and I have\r\na photograph with me which shows very well that all of the plant\r\nfood elements are essential.\r\n\r\n\"You see one pot contained no plant food and one was prepared with\r\nall of the ten essential elements provided. Then the other pots\r\ncontained all but one of the necessary soil elements, as indicated\r\nin the photograph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I never saw anything like that,\" said Mrs. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"But I have many a time,\" said her husband, \"right here on this old\r\nfarm; I don't know what's lacking, of course, but some years I've\r\nthought most everything was lacking. But, according to this\r\npot-culture test, you can't raise any crops if just one of these ten\r\nelements is lacking, no matter how much you have of the other nine;\r\nand it seems to make no difference which one is lacking, you don't\r\nget any crop. Is that the fact, Mr. Johnston?\"\r\n\r\nOne pot with no plant food, and one with all the essential elements\r\nprovided, and still others with but one element lacking. All planted\r\nthe same day and cared for alike.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" Percy replied. \"Where all of the elements are provided,\r\na fine crop is produced, but in each case where a single element is\r\nomitted that is the only difference, and in some cases the result is\r\nworse than where no plant food is supplied. It seems to hurt the\r\nplant worse to throw its food supply completely out of balance than\r\nto leave it with nothing except what it draws from the meager store\r\nin the seed planted. Of course all the pots were planted with the\r\nsame kind of seed at the same time, and they were all watered\r\nuniformly every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those results are very striking, indeed,\" said Miss Russell,\" but I\r\nsuppose one would never see such marked differences under farm\r\nconditions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only under unusual or abnormal conditions,\" Percy replied, \"but the\r\nfact is that as a very general rule our crop yields are limited\r\nchiefly because the supply of available plant food is limited.\r\nSometimes the clover crop is a complete failure on untreated land,\r\nwhile it lives and produces a good crop if the soil is properly\r\ntreated; and in such cases the difference developed in the field is\r\njust as marked as in the pot-cultures. In general we may set it down\r\nas an absolute fact that the productive power of normal land depends\r\nprimarily upon the ability of the soil to feed the crop.\r\n\r\n\"I have here a photograph of a corn field on very abnormal soil.\r\nThey had the negative at the Experiment Station and I secured a\r\nprint from it, in part because I became interested in a story\r\nconnected with this experiment field, which our professor of soil\r\nfertility reported to us.\r\n\r\n\"This shows a field of corn growing on peaty swamp land, of which\r\nthere are several hundred thousand acres in the swamp regions of\r\nIllinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. This peaty soil is extremely rich\r\nin humus and nitrogen, well supplied with phosphorus and other\r\nelements, except potassium; but in this element it is extremely\r\ndeficient. This land was drained out at large expense, and produced\r\ntwo or three large crops because the fresh grass roots contained\r\nsome readily available potassium; but after three or four years the\r\ncorn crop became a complete failure, as you see from the untreated\r\ncheck plot on the right; while the land on the left, where potassium\r\nwas applied, produced forty-five bushels per acre the year this\r\nphotograph was taken, and with heavier treatment from sixty to\r\nseventy-five bushels are produced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventy-five bushels would be fifteen barrels of corn per acre.\r\nHow's that, Little Wife?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n\"It's even more wonderful than the pot culture,\" replied Mrs.\r\nThornton; \"but how much did the potassium cost, Mr. Johnston.\"\r\n\r\n\"About three dollars an acre,\" replied Percy; \"but of course the\r\nland has almost no value if not treated; and as a matter of fact the\r\nthree dollars is less than half the interest on the difference in\r\nvalue between this land and our ordinary corn belt land. These peaty\r\nswamp lands are to a large extent in scattered areas, and commonly,\r\nif a farmer owns some of this kind of land, he also owns some other\r\ngood land, perhaps adjoining the swamp; but this is not always the\r\ncase, and was not with the man in the story I mentioned. This man\r\nlived a few miles away and his farm was practically all of this\r\npeaty swamp land type. He heard of this experiment field and came\r\nwith his family to see it.\r\n\r\n\"As he stood looking, first at the corn on the treated and untreated\r\nland, and then at his wife and large family of children, he broke\r\ndown and cried like a child. Later he explained to the\r\nsuperintendent who was showing him the experiments, that he had put\r\nthe best of his life into that kind of land. 'The land looked rich,'\r\nsaid he,--'as rich as any land I ever saw. I bought it and drained\r\nit and built my home on a sandy knoll. The first crops were fairly\r\ngood, and we hoped for better crops; but instead they grew worse and\r\nworse. We raised what we could on a small patch of sandy land, and\r\nkept trying to find out what we could grow on this black bogus land.\r\nSometimes I helped the neighbors and got a little money, but my wife\r\nand I and my older children have wasted twenty years on this land.\r\nPoverty, poverty, always! How was I to know that this single\r\nsubstance which you call potassium was all we needed to make this\r\nland productive and valuable? Oh, if I had only known this twenty\r\nyears ago, before my wife had worked like a slave,--before my\r\nchildren had grown almost to manhood and womanhood, in poverty and\r\nignorance!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why wasn't the matter investigated sooner?\" asked Miss Russell.\r\n\"Why didn't the government find out what the land needed long\r\nbefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a Yankee,\" said Percy. \"Why have American statesmen ridden\r\nback and forth to the national capitol through a wilderness of\r\ndepleted and abandoned farms in the eastern states for half a\r\ncentury or more before the first appropriation was made for the\r\npurpose of agricultural investigation? and why, even now, does not\r\nthis rich federal government appropriate to the agricultural\r\nexperiment station in every state a fund at least equal to the\r\naggregate salaries of the congressmen from the same state, this fund\r\nto be used exclusively for the purpose of discovering and\r\ndemonstrating profitable systems of permanent agriculture on every\r\ntype of soil? Why do we as a nation expend five hundred million\r\ndollars annually for the development of the army and navy, and only\r\nfifteen millions for agriculture, the one industry whose ultimate\r\nprosperity must measure the destiny of the nation?\r\n\r\n\"Moralists sometimes tell us that the fall of the Babylonian Empire,\r\nthe fall of the Egyptian Empire, of the Grecian Empire, and the\r\nRoman Empire, were all due to the development of pride and\r\nimmorality among those peoples; whereas, we believe that\r\ncivilization tends rather toward peace, security, and higher\r\ncitizenship. Is not the chief explanation for the ultimate and\r\nsuccessive fall of those great empires to be found in the exhausted\r\nor wasted agricultural resources of the country?\r\n\r\n\"The land that once flowed with milk and honey might then support a\r\nmighty empire, with independent resources sufficient for times of\r\ngreat emergencies, but now that land seems almost barren and\r\nsupports a few wandering bands of marauding Arabs and villages of\r\nbeggars.\r\n\r\n\"The power and world influence of a nation must pass away with the\r\npassing of material resources; for poverty is helpless, and\r\nignorance is the inevitable result of continued poverty. Only the\r\nprosperous can afford education or trained intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"Old land is poorer than new land. There are exceptions, but this is\r\nthe rule. The fact is known and recognized by all America.\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean? It means that the practice of the past and\r\npresent art of agriculture leads toward land ruin,--not only in\r\nChina, where famine and starvation are common, notwithstanding that\r\nthousands and thousands of Chinese are employed constantly in saving\r\nevery particle of fertilizing material, even gathering the human\r\nexcrements from every house and by-place in village and country, as\r\ncarefully as our farmers gather honey from their hives; not only in\r\nIndia where starvation's ghost is always present, where, as a rule,\r\nthere are more hungry people than the total population of the United\r\nStates; not only in Russia where famine is frequent; but, likewise\r\nin the United States of America, the present practice of the art of\r\nagriculture tends toward land ruin.\r\n\r\n\"Nations rise and fall; so does the productive power of vast areas\r\nof land. Better drainage, better seed, better implements, and more\r\nthorough tillage, all tend toward larger crops, but they also tend\r\ntoward ultimate land ruin, for the removal of larger crops only\r\nhastens soil depletion.\r\n\r\n\"To bring about the adoption of systems of farming that will restore\r\nour depleted Eastern and Southern soils, and that will maintain or\r\nincrease the productive power of our remaining fertile lands of the\r\nGreat Central West, where we are now producing half of the total\r\ncorn crop of the entire world, is not only the most important\r\nmaterial problem of the United States; but to bring this about is\r\nworthy of, and will require, the best thought of the most\r\ninfluential men of America. Without a prosperous agriculture here\r\nthere can be no permanent prosperity for our American institutions.\r\nWhile some small countries can support themselves by conducting\r\ntrade, commerce, and manufacture, for other countries, American\r\nagriculture must not only be self-supporting, but, in large degree,\r\nagriculture must support our other great industries.\r\n\r\n\"Without agriculture, the coal and iron would remain in the earth,\r\nthe forest would be left uncut, the railroads would be abandoned,\r\nthe cities depopulated, and the wooded lands and water-ways would\r\nagain be used only for hunting and fishing. Shall we not remember,\r\nfor example, that the coal mine yields a single harvest--one\r\ncrop--and is then forever abandoned; while the soil must yield a\r\nhundred--yes, a thousand crops, and even then it must be richer and\r\nmore productive than at the beginning, if those who come after us\r\nare to continue to multiply and replenish the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Even the best possible system of soil improvement, we must admit,\r\nis not the absolute and final solution of this, the most stupendous\r\nproblem of the United States. If war gives way to peace and\r\npestilence to science, then the time will come when the soils of\r\nAmerica shall reach the limit of the highest productive power\r\npossible to be permanently maintained, even by the general adoption\r\nof the most practical scientific methods; and before that limit is\r\nreached, if power, progress, and plenty are to continue in our\r\nbeloved country, there must be developed and enforced the law of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest; otherwise there is no ultimate future for\r\nAmerica different from that of China, India, and Russia, the only\r\ngreat agricultural countries comparable to the United States. An\r\nenlightened humanity must grant to all the right to live, but the\r\nreproduction and perpetuation of the unfit can never be an absolute\r\nand inalienable right.\r\n\r\n\"Under the present laws and customs, a man may spend half his life\r\nin the insane asylum or in the penitentiary, and still be the father\r\nof a dozen children with degenerate tendencies. There should be no\r\nreproduction from convicted criminals, insane persons, and other\r\ndegenerates. Thieves, grafters, bribers and bribe-takers all belong\r\nin the same class, and it should not be left possible for them to\r\nreproduce their kind. They are a burden upon the public which the\r\npublic must bear, but the public is under no obligation to permit\r\ntheir multiplication. The children of such should never become the\r\nparents of others. It is a crime against both the child and the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you will consider this extremely visionary, and so it is;\r\nbut unless America can see a vision somewhat like this, a population\r\nthat is doubling three or four times each century, and an area of\r\ndepleted soils that is also increasing at a rapid rate will combine\r\nto bring our Ship of State into a current against which we may\r\nbattle in vain; for there is not another New World to bring new\r\nwealth, new prosperity, and new life and light after another period\r\nof 'Dark Ages.'\r\n\r\n\"Whether we shall ever apply any such intelligence to the possible\r\nimprovement of our own race as we have in the great improvement of\r\nour cattle and corn is, of course, an open question; but to some\r\nextent you will agree that the grafter and the insane, like the\r\npoet, are born and not made. Of course there are, and always will\r\nbe, marked variations, mutants, or 'sports,' but, nevertheless,\r\nnatural inheritance is the master key to the improvement of every\r\nform of life; and it is an encouraging fact that some of the states,\r\nas Indiana, for example, have already adopted laws looking toward\r\nthe reduction of the reproduction of convicted degenerates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPAST SELF REDEMPTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BUT I have rambled far from the subject assigned me,\" Percy\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\"That's only because I interrupt and ask so many side questions,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Thornton, \"but I hope yet to learn more about those\r\n'suitable conditions' for nitrogen-fixation and nitrification. It\r\nbegins to look as though the nitrogen cycle deviates a good deal\r\nfrom a true circle, and nature seems to need some help from us to\r\nmake that element circulate as fast as we need it. I confess, too,\r\nthat this method appeals to me much more than the\r\ntwenty-cent-a-pound proposition of the fertilizer agent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" added Miss Russell; \"and if we had to spend three\r\ndollars an acre on this farm our 'Slough of Despond' would be worse\r\nthan the slough, or swamp, Mr. Johnston has told us about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear the practical and profitable improvement of an acre of this\r\nland is more likely to cost thirty dollars than three,\" said Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for the land's sake!\" came the ejaculation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, 'for the land's sake,'\" repeated Percy; \"and for the sake of\r\nthose who must depend upon the land for their support for all time\r\nhereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"How ridiculous! Thirty dollars an acre for the improvement of land\r\nthat will not bring ten dollars to begin with!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is better to look at the other end of the undertaking,\" said\r\nPercy. \"Suppose you invest thirty dollars an acre and in a few years\r\nmake your ten-dollar land produce as much as our two-hundred dollar\r\nland!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Johnston; do you realize how much money it would require\r\nto expend thirty dollars an acre on nine hundred acres?\" continued\r\nMiss Russell, with stronger accentuation.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-seven thousand dollars,\" was the simple reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir,\" she said, \"you are welcome to this whole farm for ten\r\nthousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not wishing for it,\" he answered. \"In fact I would not take\r\nthis farm as a gift, if I were obliged to keep it and pay the taxes\r\nand had no other property or source of income.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just the kind of talk I've been putting up to these girls,\"\r\nsaid Mr. Thornton. \"By the time we live and pay about two hundred\r\ndollars a year taxes on all this land, I tell you, there is nothing\r\nleft; and we'd been worse off than we are, except for the sale we\r\nmade to the railroad company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Russells lived here very well for more than a hundred\r\nyears,\" she retorted, \"and my grandfather supported one nigger for\r\nevery ten acres of the farm, but I would like to know any farmers\r\nabout here who can put thirty dollars an acre, or even ten dollars\r\nan acre, back into their soil for improvement.\"\r\n\r\n\"The problem is indeed a serious one,\" said Percy. \"Unquestionably\r\nmuch of the land in these older states is far past the point of\r\npossible self-redemption under the present ownership. Land from\r\nwhich the fertility has been removed by two hundred years of\r\ncropping, until it has ceased to return a living to those who till\r\nit, cannot have its fertility restored sufficiently to again make\r\nits cultivation profitable, except by making some considerable\r\ninvestment in order to replace those essential elements the supply\r\nof which has become so limited as to limit the crop yields to a\r\npoint where their value is below the cost of production. Even on the\r\nremaining productive lands in the North Central States, if we are\r\never to adopt systems of permanent agriculture, it must be done\r\nwhile the landowners are still prosperous. If the people of the corn\r\nbelt repeat the history of the Eastern States until their lands\r\ncease to return a profit above the total cost of production, then\r\nthey, too, will have nothing left to invest in the improvement of\r\ntheir lands.\"\r\n\r\n\"But their fertility could still be restored by outside capital?\"\r\nsuggested Mr. Thornton. \"I know very well that is the only solution\r\nof our problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tom, I would like to know where the outside capital is coming\r\nfrom,\" said Miss Russell.\r\n\r\n\"Marry rich,\" he replied. \"Don't make such a blunder as your sister\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear that Mr. Johnston will suggest that we sell some more land,\"\r\nremarked Mrs. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied her sister; \"and we will sell it to him. If he\r\nwon't take the whole farm as a gift, we'll cut it to any length he\r\nwishes. Do you consider 'Ten Acres Enough,' Mr. Johnston; or would\r\nyou prefer 'Three Acres and Liberty?' We'll do our best to enable\r\nyou to enjoy 'The Fat of the Land.' Just tell us how large a farm\r\nyou want, I know already that you do not want nine hundred acres.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Russell,\" said Percy. \"This is so sudden\"; whereupon\r\nMr. Thornton nearly fell from his chair and Mrs. Thornton laughed\r\nheartily at the sister's expense who blushed as she might have done\r\ntwenty years before.\r\n\r\n\"However,\" Percy resumed, \"if you should decide to dispose of about\r\nhalf of that seven hundred acres which you use only as a safety bank\r\nfor most of your two hundred dollars in taxes, please consider me a\r\nprospective taker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take her,\" said Mr. Thornton, and again confusion reigned.\r\n\r\n\"Tom is so anxious to get rid of his sister-in-law that he reminds\r\nme of the man whose mother-in-law died,\" said Miss Russell. \"He was\r\ntoo far from home to return to the usual funeral, and they\r\ntelegraphed him the sad news and asked if they should embalm,\r\ncremate, or bury the remains. He wired back: 'Embalm, cremate, and\r\nbury'\"\r\n\r\n\"That matter of outside capital is by no means so substantial as it\r\nmight seem,\" said Percy. \"It is worth while to consider how little\r\nreal wealth there would be in America if the remaining rich lands\r\nshould become impoverished. The railroads would at once cease to pay\r\ndividends, and those who are now millionaires in railroad stock\r\nwould find themselves on the rapid road to poverty. The manufacturer\r\nof finished products from the raw materials raised on the farm, the\r\nmanufacturer of agricultural implements, and the great urban\r\npopulation whose income is from the trade in raw materials and\r\nmanufactured goods would soon see their wealth shrivel. The great\r\nsky scrapers of the cities would be left for the owls and bats to\r\nharbor in, if our agricultural lands ceased to yield their great\r\nharvests. Meanwhile the farming people would continue to live upon\r\nthe meager products still produced from the impoverished soil, even\r\nthough they had no surplus food to ship into the cities. Human labor\r\nwould replace that of domestic animals on the farm, just as it has\r\ndone in China and India, in part because man's labor is worth more\r\nthan that of the beast, when measured only by the amount of food\r\nconsumed, and in part because a thousand bushels of grain will\r\nsupport five times as many people can be supported for the same time\r\nupon the animal products that could be produced by feeding the\r\ngrain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is such a gloomy view to take of it,\" said Miss Russell.\r\n\r\n\"And all the world loves an optimist,\" replied Percy laughingly.\r\n\"Soils do not wear out; there is no poor land; the farms are better\r\nand the crops larger than ever before; and we are the people of the\r\nworld's greatest nation, with an assured future glory which\r\nsurposses all conception.\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as we get the canal dug,\" suggested Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we will surely be able to dig that Panama ditch,\" said Percy;\r\n\"and probably our resources will last to cut a gash or two in our\r\nown interior, if we don't build too many battle ships. You know\r\nEgypt built three great pyramids before her resources became reduced\r\nto such an extent that the people required all their energies to\r\nsecure a living.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nMORE PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NOW let us give Mr. Johnston a chance to tell us about the nitrogen\r\nproblem,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"I'm pretty well satisfied with the\r\nnatural circulation of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen; but I want to\r\nunderstand all I can of the practical methods of securing and\r\nutilizing nitrogen; and we have heard almost nothing about the other\r\nsix essential elements which the soil must furnish. Let me see.--I\r\nthink you said that iron, calcium, magnesium and potassium are\r\nusually abundant in the soil, while phosphorus and sulfur are very\r\nlimited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the rule under general or average conditions, but it\r\nshould be stated that the amount of sulfur required by plants is\r\nvery small as compared with phosphorus, a difference which places a\r\ngreat distinction between them. Besides considerable quantities of\r\nsulfur are returned to the air in the combustion of coal and organic\r\nmatter, and this returns to the soil in rain. The information thus\r\nfar secured shows that sulfur rarely if ever limits the crop yields\r\nunder field conditions; and the same may be said of iron, which is\r\nrequired by plants in very small amount and is contained in\r\npractically all soils in enormous quantities.\r\n\r\n\"While normal soils contain abundance of potassium, with about half\r\nas much calcium and one-fourth as much magnesium; yet, when measured\r\nby crop requirements for plant food, the supplies of these three\r\nelements are not markedly different. On the other hand, about 300\r\npounds of calcium are lost per acre per annum by leaching from good\r\nsoils in humid climates, compared with about 10 pounds of potasssium\r\nand intermediate amounts of magnesium; so that, of these three\r\nelements, calcium requires by far the most consideration and\r\npotassium the least, even aside from the use of limestone to correct\r\nor prevent soil acidity.\r\n\r\n\"Among the conditions essential for nitrification may be mentioned\r\nthe presence of free oxygen and limestone; and of course all\r\nbacteria require certain food materials, resembling other plants in\r\nthis respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they plants?\" asked Mrs. Thornton. \"I thought they were tiny\r\nlittle animals.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are classified as plants,\" replied Percy; \"but the\r\nscientists have difficulty with some of the lower organism to decide\r\nwhether they are plants or animals. The college boys used to say\r\nthat some animals were plants in the botanical department and\r\nanimals again when they studied zoology. Orton says it is easy to\r\ntell a cow from a cabbage, but impossible to assign any absolute,\r\ndistinctive character which will divide animal life from plant life.\r\n\r\n\"The oxygen is essential for nitrification, because that is an\r\noxidation process. That is, it is a kind of combustion, so to speak.\r\nThe organic matter is oxidized or converted into substances\r\ncontaining more oxygen than in the original form. In ammonification\r\nthe carbon is separated or divorced from the nitrogen and united\r\nwith oxygen. Some of the hydrogen of the organic matter remains\r\ntemporarily with the carbon, and some is held temporarily with the\r\nnitrogen in the form of ammonia.\r\n\r\n\"The nitrite bacteria replace two of the hydrogen atoms in ammonia\r\nwith one of oxygen, and insert another oxygen atom between the\r\nnitrogen and the remaining hydrogen, thus forming nitrous acid;\r\nH-O-N=O, or HNO2.\r\n\r\n\"The nitrate bacteria then cause the direct addition of another\r\noxygen atom, which is held by the two extra bonds of the nitrogen\r\natom, which you will remember is a five-handed atom.\r\n\r\n\"Thus you will see the absolute need of free oxygen in the\r\nnitrification process; and we can control the rate of nitrification\r\nto a considerable extent by our methods of tillage. In soils\r\ndeficient in organic matter, excessive cultivation may still\r\nliberate sufficient nitrogen for a fairly satisfactory crop; and the\r\nbenefits of such excessive cultivation for potatoes and other\r\nvegetables is more often due to increased nitrification than to the\r\nconservation of moisture, to which it is frequently ascribed by\r\nagricultural writers.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the more we cultivate, the more we hasten the nitrification,\r\noxidation, or destruction of the organic matter or humus of the\r\nsoil. Where the soil is well supplied with decaying organic matter,\r\nwe rarely need to cultivate in a humid section like this, except for\r\nthe purpose of killing weeds.\r\n\r\n\"The presence of carbonates in the soil is essential for\r\nnitrification, because the bacteria will not continue the process in\r\nthe presence of their own product. Nitrification ceases if the\r\nnitrous or nitric acid remains as such; but, in the presence of\r\ncarbonates such as calcium carbonate (ordinary limestone) or the\r\ndouble carbonate of magnesium and calcium (magnesian limestone, or\r\ndolomite), the nitrous acid or nitric acid is converted into a\r\nneutral salt of calcium or magnesium, one of these atoms taking the\r\nplace of two hydrogen atoms and forming, say, calcium nitrate:\r\nCa(NO3)2. At the same time the hydrogen atoms take the place of the\r\ncalcium in limestone ( CaC03), and form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which\r\nat once decomposes into water (H2O) and carbon dioxid (CO2), which\r\nthus escapes as a gas into the air or remains in the pores of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\"The fact that nitrification will not proceed in the presence of\r\nacid reminds us that only a certain degree of acidity can be\r\ndeveloped in sour milk. Here the lactic acid bacteria produce the\r\nacid from milk sugar, but the process stops when about seven-tenths\r\nof one per cent. of lactic acid has developed. If some basic\r\nsubstance, such as lime, is then added, the acid is neutralized and\r\nthe fermentation again proceeds.\r\n\r\n\"In the general process of decay and oxidation of the organic matter\r\nof the soil, the nitrogen thus passes through the forms of ammonia,\r\nnitrous acid, and nitric acid, and at the same time the carbon\r\npasses into various acid compounds, including the complex humic and\r\nulmic acids, and smaller amounts of acetic acid (found in vinegar),\r\nlactic acid, oxalic acid (found in oxalic), and tartaric acid (found\r\nin grapes). The final oxidation products of the carbon and hydrogen\r\nare carbon dioxid and water, which result from the decomposition of\r\nthe carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n\"Now the various acids of carbon and nitrogen constitute one of the\r\nmost important factors in soil fertility. They are the means by\r\nwhich the farmer can dissolve and make available for the growing\r\ncrops the otherwise insoluble mineral elements, such as iron,\r\ncalcium, magnesium, and potassium, all of which are contained in\r\nmost soils in great abundance. These elements exist in the soil\r\nchiefly in the form of insoluble silicates. Silicon itself is a\r\nfour-handed element which bears somewhat the same relation to the\r\nmineral matter of the soil as carbon bears to the organic matter.\r\nQuartz sand is silicon dioxid (SiO2). Oxygen, which is present in\r\nnearly all substances, including air, water, and most solids,\r\nconstitutes about one-half of all known matter. Silicon is next in\r\nabundance, amounting to more than one-fourth of the solid crust of\r\nthe earth. Aluminum is third in abundance (about seven per cent),\r\naluminum silicate being common clay. Iron, calcium, potassium,\r\nsodium, and magnesium, in this order, complete the eight abundant\r\nelements, which aggregate about ninety-eight per cent. of the solid\r\ncrust of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"It is worth while to know that about two and one-half per cent. of\r\nthe earth's crust is potassium, while about one-tenth of one per\r\ncent. is phosphorus; also that when a hundred bushels of corn are\r\nsold from the farm, seventeen pounds of phosphorus, nineteen of\r\npotassium, and seven of magnesium are carried away.\r\n\r\n\"The acids formed from the decaying organic matter not only liberate\r\nfor the use of crops the mineral elements contained in the soil in\r\nabundance, but they also help to make available the phosphorus of\r\nraw phosphate, when naturally contained in the soil, as it is to\r\nsome extent in all soils, or when applied to the soil in the\r\nfine-ground natural phosphate from the mines.\r\n\r\n\"Now the increase or decrease of organic matter in the soil is\r\nmeasured with a very good degree of satisfaction by the element\r\nnitrogen, which is a regular constituent of the organic matter of\r\nthe soil; and you are already familiar, Mr. Thornton, with the\r\namounts of nitrogen contained in average farm manure and in some of\r\nour most common crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir, I have some of the figures in my note book and I mean to\r\nhave them in my head very soon. But, say, that organic matter seems\r\nto be a thing of tremendous importance, and I'm sure we've got\r\nmighty little of it. I think about the only thing we'll need to do\r\nto make this old farm productive again is to grow the vegetation and\r\nplow it under. As it decays, it will furnish the nitrogen, and\r\nliberate the phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium; and we\r\nmay have plenty of all of them just waiting to be liberated.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is altogether possible,\" said Percy; \"but it must be\r\nremembered that your soil is acid and consequently will not grow\r\nclover or alfalfa successfully, or even cowpeas very satisfactorily.\r\nA liberal use of ground limestone and large use of clover may be\r\nsufficient to greatly improve your soil; but if I am permitted to\r\nseparate Miss Russell and the Thorntons \"--Mr. Thornton's hilarious\r\n\"Ha, ha\" cut Percy short. He crimsoned and the ladies smiled at each\r\nother with expressions that revealed nothing whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Now let me finish,\" Percy continued, when Mr. Thornton had somewhat\r\nsubsided. \"I say, if I am permitted to separate Miss Russell and the\r\nThorntons from about three hundred acres of their land, I shall\r\ncertainly wish to know its total content of phosphorus, potassium,\r\nmagnesium, and calcium, before I make any purchase; and, if you will\r\nremember the pot cultures and the peaty swamp land, I think you'd\r\nagree with me.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shall be mighty glad to know that myself,\" said Mr.\r\nThornton, \"and we shall much appreciate it if you can tell us how\r\nto secure that information.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can collect some soil to-morrow,\" Percy replied, \"and send it to\r\na chemist for analysis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Mr. Thornton; \"now just one more question, and I think\r\nI shall sleep better if I have it answered to-night. Just what is\r\nmeant by potash and phosphoric acid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Potash,\" said Percy, \"is a compound of potassium and oxygen. The\r\nproportions are one atom of oxygen and two atoms of potassium, which\r\nyou may remember are single-handed and weigh thirty-nine, so that\r\nseventy-eight of potassium unite with sixteen of oxygen. A better\r\nname for the compound is potassium oxid: K20. The Latin name for\r\npotassium is kalium, and K is the symbol used for an atom of that\r\nelement. If you were to purchase potassium in the form of potassium\r\nchlorid, which in the East is often called by the old incorrect name\r\n'muriate of potash,' the salt might be guaranteed to contain a\r\ncertain percentage of potash, which, however, consists of\r\neighty-three per cent. of potassium and seventeen of oxygen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what is this potassium chlorid, or 'muriate of potash'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pure potassium chlorid contains only the two elements, potassium\r\nand chlorin.\"\r\n\r\n\"But didn't you say that it was guaranteed to contain potash and\r\nthat potash is part oxygen? Now you say it contains only potassium\r\nand chlorin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am sorry to say, that this is one of those blunders of our\r\nsemi-scientific ancestors for which we still suffer. The chemist\r\nunderstands that the meaning of the guarantee of potash is the\r\namount of potash that the potassium present in the potassium chlorid\r\ncould be converted into. The best you can do is to reduce the potash\r\nguarantee to potassium by taking eighty-three per cent. of it; or,\r\nto be more exact, divide by ninety-four and multiply by\r\nseventy-eight, in order to eliminate the sixteen parts of oxygen.\r\n\r\n\"It may be well to keep in mind that when the druggist says potash\r\nhe means potassium hydroxid, KOH, a compound of potassium, hydrogen,\r\nand oxygen, as the name indicates.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mentioned the word chlorin,\" said Mr. Thornton. \"That is\r\nanother element?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is a very common element. Ordinary table salt is sodium\r\nchlorid: NaCl. Sodium is called natrium in Latin, and Na is the\r\nsymbol used in English to be in harmony with all other languages,\r\nfor practically all use the same chemical symbols. Sodium and\r\npotassium are very similar elements in some respects, and in the\r\nfree state they are very peculiar, apparently taking fire when\r\nthrown into water. Chlorin in the free state is a poisonous gas.\r\nThus the change in properties is well illustrated when these two\r\ndangerous elements, sodium and chlorin, unite to form the harmless\r\ncompound which we call common salt.\r\n\r\n\"It is a shame,\" continued Percy, \"that agricultural science has so\r\nlong been burdened with such a term as 'phosphoric acid,' which\r\nserves to complicate and confuse what should be made the simplest\r\nsubject to every American farmer and landowner. As agriculture is\r\nthe fundamental support of America and of all her other great\r\nindustries, so the fertility of the soil is the absolute support of\r\nevery form of agriculture. Now, if there is any one factor that can\r\nbe the most important, where so many are positively essential, then\r\nthe most important factor in the problem of adopting and maintaining\r\npermanent systems of profitable agriculture on American soils is the\r\nelement phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\"Phosphorus in very appreciable amount is positively necessary for\r\nthe growth of every organism. It is an absolutely essential\r\nconstituent of the nucleus of every living cell, whether plant or\r\nanimal. Nuclein, itself, which is the substance nearest to the\r\nbeginning of a new cell, contains as high as ten per cent. of the\r\nelement phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, phosphorus is the most limited of all the plant\r\nfood elements, measured by supply and demand and circulation.\r\n\r\n\"What is phosphoric acid? Well, the professor of chemistry says it\r\nis a compound containing three atoms of hydrogen, one of phosphorus,\r\nand four of oxygen. It is a syrupy liquid and one of the strongest\r\nmineral acids. In concentrated form it is as caustic as oil of\r\nvitriol. Why, here you have a Century dictionary. That should tell\r\nwhat phosphoric acid is. This is what the Century says:\r\n\r\n\"'It is a colorless, odorless syrup, with an intensely sour taste.\r\nIt is tribasic, forming three distinct classes of metallic salts.\r\nThe three atoms of hydrogen may in like manner be replaced by\r\nalcohol radicles, forming acid and neutral ethers. Phosphoric acid\r\nis used in medicine as a tonic.'\r\n\r\n\"That,\" continued Percy, \"is the complete definition as given by the\r\nCentury dictionary as to what phosphoric acid is, and I note that\r\nthis is the latest edition of the Century, copyrighted in 1902.\"\r\n\r\n\"We bought it less than a month ago,\" said Mrs. Thornton. \"We can\r\nhave so few books that we thought the Century would be a pretty good\r\nlibrary in itself; Mr. Thornton has had too little time to use it\r\nmuch as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, even if I had used it,\" said Mr. Thornton, \"you see there are\r\nfive volumes before I'd get to the P's. But, joking aside, I don't\r\nget much out of that definition except that phosphoric acid is a\r\nsour liquid and is used in medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The definition is entirely correct,\" said Percy \"Any text on\r\nchemistry will give you a very similar definition, and your\r\nphysician and druggist will give you the same information.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know the fertilizer agents claim to sell phosphoric acid in\r\ntwo-hundred-pound bags which wouldn't hold any kind of liquid.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied Percy, \"and I consider it a shame that the farm boy\r\nwho goes to the high school or college and is there taught exactly\r\nwhat phosphoric acid is, must. when he returns to the farm, try to\r\nread bulletins from his agricultural experiment station in which the\r\nterm 'phosphoric acid' is used for what it is not. At the state\r\nagricultural college, the professor of chemistry correctly teaches\r\nthe farm boy that phosphoric acid is a liquid compound containing\r\nthree atoms of hydrogen, one of phosphorus, and four of oxygen in\r\nthe molecule; and then the same professor, as an experiment station\r\ninvestigator, goes to the farmers' institutes and incorrectly\r\nteaches the same boy's father that phosphoric acid is a solid\r\ncompound pound containing two atoms of phosphorus and five atoms of\r\noxygen in the molecule.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why do they continue to teach such confusion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir, if they know, they never tell. In some manner this\r\nmisuse of the name was begun, and every year doubles the difficulty\r\nof stopping it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the man that was too lazy to stop work when he had once\r\nbegun,\" remarked Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Percy, \"but it is true that some of the States have\r\nadopted the practice of reporting analyses of soils and fertilizers\r\non the basis of nitrogen instead of ammonia; and in the Corn Belt\r\nStates, phosphorus and potassium are the terms used to a large\r\nextent instead of 'phosphoric acid,' and potash. The agricultural\r\npress is greatly assisting in bringing about the adoption of the\r\nsimpler system, and the laws of some States now require that the\r\npercentages of the actual plant food elements, as nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus, and potassium, shall be guaranteed in fertilizers\r\noffered for sale. It is one of those questions that are never\r\nsettled until they are settled right; and it is only a question of\r\ntime until the simple element basis will be used throughout the\r\nUnited States, or at least in the Central and Western States.\"\r\n\r\n\"The so-called 'phosphoric acid' of the fertilizer agent is a\r\ncompound whose molecule contains two atoms of phosphorus and five\r\natoms of oxygen; and, since the atomic weight of phosphorus is\r\nthirty-one and that of oxygen sixteen, this compound contains\r\nsixty-two parts of phosphorus and eighty parts of oxygen. In other\r\nwords, this phosphoric acid, falsely so-called, contains a trifle\r\nless than forty-four per cent. of the actual element phosphorus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the bone phosphate of lime that the agents talk about the same\r\nas the 'phosphoric acid'?\" asked Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"No, by 'bone phosphate of lime,' which is often abbreviated B. P.\r\nL., is meant tricalcium phosphate, a compound which contains exactly\r\ntwenty per cent. of phosphorus. Thus, you can always divide the\r\nguaranteed percentage of 'bone phosphate of lime' by five, and the\r\nresult will be the per cent. of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\"As stated in your Century dictionary, true phosphoric acid forms\r\nthree distinct classes of salts, because either one, two, or all of\r\nthe three hydrogen atoms may be replaced by a metallic element.\r\nThus, we have phosphoric acid itself containing the three hydrogen\r\natoms, one phosphorus atom, and four oxygen atoms. This might be\r\ncalled trihydrogen phosphate (H3PO4). Now if one of the hydrogen\r\natoms is replaced by one potassium atom, we have potassium\r\ndihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4); with two potassium atoms and one\r\nhydrogen, we have dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4); and if\r\nall hydrogen is replaced by potassium the compound is tripotassium\r\nphosphate (K3PO4). To make similar salts with two-handed metallic\r\nelements, like calcium or magnesium, we need to start with two\r\nmolecules of phosphoric acid H6(PO4)2; because each atom of calcium\r\nwill replace two hydrogen atoms. Thus we have mono calcium\r\nphosphate, CaH4(PO4)2, dicalcium phosphate, Ca2H2(PO4)2, and\r\ntricalcium phosphate, Ca3(PO4)2. It goes without saying that\r\nmonocalcium phosphate contains four atoms of hydrogen and that\r\ndicalcium phosphate contains two hydrogen atoms. By knowing the\r\natomic weights (40 for calcium, 31 for phosphorus, and 16 for\r\noxygen), it is easy to compute that the molecule of tricalcium\r\nphosphate weighs 310 of which 62 is phosphorus. This is exactly\r\none-fifth, or twenty per cent. This compound you will remember is\r\nsometimes called 'bone phosphate of lime'. It is also called simply\r\n'bone phosphate'; because it is the phosphorus compound contained in\r\nbones. It is sometimes called lime phosphate, although it contains\r\nno lime in the true sense, for it has no power to neutralize acid\r\nsoils, except when the phosphorus is taken up by plants more rapidly\r\nthan the calcium, which in such case might remain in the soil to act\r\nas a base to neutralize soil acids; but even then the effect of the\r\nsmall amount of calcium thus liberated from the phosphate would be\r\nvery insignificant compared with a liberal application of ground\r\nlimestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Thornton, stretching himself, \"orange phosphate is\r\nmy favorite drink but I fear some of these phosphate you have just\r\nbeen giving me are too concentrated. I ought to have the dose\r\ndiluted; but I like the taste of it, and if you'll write a book\r\nalong this line, in this plain way just about as you have been\r\ngiving it to me straight for almost twelve hours, I tell you I'll\r\nread it over till I learn to understand it a heap better than I do\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCLOSER TO MOTHER EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following day Percy collected soil samples to represent the\r\ncommon type of soil on the farm. In the main the land was nearly\r\nlevel and very uniform, although here and there were small areas\r\nwhich varied from the main type, and in places the variation was\r\nmarked. Percy and his host devoted the entire day to an examination\r\nof the soils of the farm and the collection of the samples.\r\n\r\n\"The prevailing soil type is what would be called a loam,\" said\r\nPercy, \"and a single set of composite samples will fairly represent\r\nat least three-fourths of the land on this farm.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that it is enough for the present to sample this\r\nprevailing type, and later, if you desire, you could collect samples\r\nof the minor types, of which there are at least three that are quite\r\ndistinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"A loam soil is one that includes a fair proportion of the several\r\ngroups of soil materials, including silt, clay, and sand.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is silt?\" asked Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Silt consists of the soil particles which are finer than sand,--too\r\nsmall in fact to be felt as soil grains by rubbing between the\r\nfingers, and yet it is distinctly granular, while clay is a mere\r\nplastic or sticky mass like dough. What are commonly called clay\r\nsoils consist largely of silt, but contain enough true clay to bind\r\nthe silt into a stiff mass. In the main such soils are silt loams,\r\nbut when deficient in organic matter they are yellow in color as a\r\nrule, and all such material is usually called clay by the farmers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I had no idea that it would take us a whole day to get enough\r\ndirt for an analysis,\" remarked Mr. Thornton, as they were\r\ncollecting the samples late in the afternoon. \"Five minutes would\r\nhave been plenty of time for me, before I saw the holes you've bored\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" replied Percy, \"that the most difficult work of the\r\nsoil investigator is to collect the samples. Of course any one could\r\nfill these little bags with soil in five minutes, but the question\r\nis, what would the soil represent? It may represent little more than\r\nthe hole it came out of, as would be the case where the soil had\r\nbeen disturbed by burrowing animals, or modified by surface\r\naccumulations, as where a stack may sometime have been burned. In\r\nthe one case the subsoil may have been brought up and mixed with the\r\nsurface, and in the other the mineral constituents taken from forty\r\nacres in a crop of clover may have been returned to one-tenth of an\r\nacre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly such things have occurred on many farms,\" agreed Mr.\r\nThornton, \"and they may have occurred on this farm for all any one\r\nknows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty tons of clover hay,\" continued Percy, after making a few\r\ncomputations, \"would contain 400 pounds of phosphorus, 2400 pounds\r\nof potassium, 620 pounds of magnesium, and 2340 pounds of calcium.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you keep all those figures in your head,\" said Mr.\r\nJohnston.\r\n\r\n\"How many pounds are there in a ton of hay?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Two thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many pounds in a bushel of oats?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty in Virginia, but thirty-two in Carolina.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many in a bushel of wheat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty\"\r\n\r\n\"Corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty-six pounds of shelled corn, or seventy pounds of ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Potatoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eighty-six pounds,--both kinds the same, but most States require\r\nsixty pounds for the Irish potatoes.\"\r\n\r\nPercy laughed. \"You see,\" he said, \"you have more figures in your\r\nhead than I have in mine. You have mentioned twice as many right\r\nhere, without a moment's hesitation, as I try to remember for the\r\nplant food contained in clover. I like to keep in mind the\r\nrequirements of large crops, such as it is possible to raise under\r\nour climatic conditions if we will provide the stuff the crops are\r\nmade of, so far as we need to, and do the farm work as it should be\r\ndone. I never try to remember how much plant food is required for\r\ntwenty-two bushels of corn per acre, which is the average yield of\r\nVirginia for the last ten years, while an authentic record reports a\r\nyield of 239 bushels from an acre of land in South Carolina. On our\r\nlittle farm in Illinois we have one field of sixteen acres, which\r\nwas used for a pasture and feed lot for many years by my grandfather\r\nand has been thoroughly tile-drained since I was born, that has\r\nproduced as high as 2,015 bushels of corn in one season, thus making\r\nan average of 126 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n\"What I try to remember is the plant food requirements for such\r\ncrops as we ought to try to raise, if we do what ought to be done. I\r\ntry to remember the plant food required for a hundred-bushel crop of\r\ncorn, a hundred-bushel crop of oats, a fifty-bushel crop of wheat,\r\nand four tons of clover hay. It is an easy matter to divide these\r\namounts by two, as I have really been doing here in the East where\r\nit is hard for people to think in terms of such crops as these lands\r\nought to be made to produce.\r\n\r\n\"The requirements of the clover crop I certainly want to have in\r\nmind as a part of my little stock of ever-ready knowledge. It is not\r\nvery hard to remember that a four-ton crop of clover hay, which we\r\nought to harvest from one acre in two cuttings, contains:\r\n\r\n160 pounds of nitrogen,\r\n31 pounds of magnesium,\r\n20 pounds of phosphorus,\r\n120 pounds of potassium,\r\n117 pounds of calcium.\r\n\r\n\"It is just as easy to think in these terms as in per cent. or\r\npounds of butter fat, which I understand is the basis on which you\r\nsell your cream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I believe you are right in this matter, Mr. Johnston, but I\r\nhave never been able to see how we could apply the figures reported\r\nfrom chemical analysis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I see how any one but a chemist could make much use of\r\nthe reports which the analyst usually publishes. Such reports will\r\nusually show the percentages of moisture and so-called 'phosphoric\r\nacid,' for example, in a sample of clover hay, and perhaps the\r\npercentages of these constituents in a sample of soil; but to\r\nconnect the requirements of the clover crop with the invoice of the\r\nsoil demand more of a mental effort than I was prepared for before I\r\nwent to the agricultural college.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand we were taught in college that the plowed soil of\r\nan acre of our most common Illinois corn belt land contains only\r\n1200 pounds of phosphorus, and that a hundred-bushel crop of corn\r\ntakes twenty-three pounds of phosphorus out of the soil. Furthermore\r\nthat about one pound of phosphorus per acre is lost annually in\r\ndrainage water in humid regions. By dividing 1200 by 24 it is easy\r\nto see that fifty corn crops such as we ought to try to raise would\r\nrequire as much phosphorus as the present supply in our soil to a\r\ndepth of about seven inches. Of course there is some phosphorus\r\nbelow seven inches, but it is the plowed soil we must depend upon to\r\na very large extent. The oldest agricultural experiment station in\r\nthe world is at Rothamsted, England. On two plots of ground in the\r\nsame field where wheat has been grown every year for sixty years,\r\nthe soil below the plow line has practically the same composition,\r\nbut on one plot the average yield for the last fifty years has been\r\nthirteen bushels per acre, while on the other the yield of wheat has\r\naveraged thirty-seven bushels for the same fifty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same kind of wheat?\" inquired Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and great care has always been taken to have these two plots\r\ntreated alike in all respects, save one.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plant food was regularly incorporated with the plowed soil of the\r\nhigh-yielding plot.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that farm manure was used?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not a pound of farm manure has been used on that plot for more\r\nthan sixty years; and, furthermore, the two plots were very much\r\nalike at the beginning; but, to the high-yielding plot, nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sulfur have all been\r\napplied in suitable compounds every year.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say,\" observed Mr. Thornton, \"that the land itself has\r\nproduced thirteen bushels of wheat per acre and the plant food\r\napplied has produced twenty four bushels, making the total yield\r\nthirty-seven bushels on the fertilized land.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is certainly a fair way to state it,\" replied Percy.\r\n\r\n\" Well, that sounds as though something might be done with run-down\r\nlands. About what part of the twenty-four bushels increase would it\r\ntake to pay for the fertilizers?\"\r\n\r\n\"About 150 per cent. of it,\" Percy replied.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred and fifty per cent! Why, you can't have more than a\r\nhundred per cent. of anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, you can. The twenty-four bushels are one hundred per cent.\r\nof what the fertilizers produced, and the land itself increased this\r\nby fifty per cent., so that the fertilized land produced one hundred\r\nand fifty per cent. of the increase from the plant food applied.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's too much college mathematics for me; but do you mean\r\nto say that it would take the whole thirty-seven bushels to pay for\r\nthe plant food that produced the increase of twenty-four bushels?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly what I mean. I see that you do not like percentage\r\nany better than I do. Really the acre is the best agricultural unit.\r\nWe buy and sell the land itself by the acre; we report crop yields\r\nat so many bushels or tons per acre; we apply manure at so many\r\nloads or tons per acre; we apply so many hundred pounds of\r\nfertilizer per acre; sow our wheat and oats at so many pecks or\r\nbushels per acre; and we ought to know the invoice of plant food in\r\nthe plowed soil of an acre and the amounts carried off in the crops\r\nremoved from an acre.\r\n\r\n\"Now, referring again to these figures from the forty acres of\r\nclover at two tons per acre. If the eighty tons were burned and the\r\nashes mixed with the surface soil on a tenth of an acre the increase\r\nper acre would be as follows:\r\n\r\n4,000 pounds of phosphorus\r\n24,000 pounds of potassium\r\n6,200 pounds of magnesium\r\n23,400 pounds of calcium.\r\n\r\n\"These, remember, are the amounts per acre that would be added to\r\nthe soil by burning the eighty tons of clover on one-tenth of an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\"Now compare these figures with the total amounts of the same\r\nelements contained in the common corn belt prairie soil of Illinois,\r\nwhich are as follows:\r\n\r\n1,200 pounds of phosphorus\r\n35,000 pounds of potassium\r\n8,600 pounds of magnesium\r\n5,400 pounds of calcium.\r\n\r\n\"From these figures you will see that the analysis of a single\r\nsample of soil collected from a spot of ground that had sometimes\r\nreceived such an addition as this would be positively worse than\r\nworthless, because it would give false information, and that is much\r\nworse than no information.\r\n\r\n\"The methods of chemical analysis have been developed to a high\r\ndegree of accuracy, and it is not a difficult matter to find a\r\nchemist who can make a correct analysis of the sample placed in his\r\nhands; but the chief difficulties lie, first, in securing samples of\r\nsoil that will truly represent the type or types of soil on the\r\nfarm; and, second, in the interpretation of the results of analysis\r\nwith reference to the adoption of methods of soil improvement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the report of the analysis as confusing with respect to other\r\nelements as with potassium and phosphorus, which, I understand, are\r\nlikely to be reported in terms of potash and a 'phosphoric acid'\r\nthat is not true phosphoric acid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still worse,\" Percy replied. \"The calcium is commonly reported in\r\nterms of lime, or, as you would say, quick lime; and vet the soil\r\nmay be an acid soil, like yours, and contain no lime whatever,\r\nneither as quick lime nor limestone. I have seen an analysis\r\nreporting half a per cent. of calcium oxid, which would make five\r\ntons of quick lime in the plowed soil of an acre; whereas the soil\r\nnot only contained no lime whatever, but was so acid that it needed\r\nfive tons of ground limestone per acre to correct the acidity.\r\n\r\n\"The trouble is that when the chemist found calcium in the soil\r\nexisting in the form of acid silicate, or calcium hydrogen silicate,\r\nhe reported calcium oxid, or lime, in his analytical statement,\r\nassuming apparently that the farmer would understand that the\r\nanalytical statement did not mean what it said.\"\r\n\r\n\"But some soils do contain lime, do they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some soils contain limestone,\" replied Percy, \"and the analysis of\r\nsuch a soil should report the amount of limestone, or calcium\r\ncarbonate, based upon the actual determination of carbonate carbon\r\nor carbon dioxid, which is a true measure of the basic property of\r\nthe soil, even though the limestone may be somewhat magnesian in\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nFor a set of soil samples. Percy collected soil from three different\r\nstrata. The first sample represented the surface stratum from the\r\ntop to six and two-third inches; the second sample represented the\r\nsubsurface stratum from six and two-thirds to twenty inches; and the\r\nthird sample represented the subsoil from twenty to forty inches,\r\neach sample being a composite of about twenty borings.\r\n\r\nIn collecting these the hole was bored to six and two-third inches\r\nand somewhat enlarged by scraping up and down with the auger, all of\r\nthe soil being put into a numbered bag. Then, the hole was extended\r\nand the subsurface boring removed without touching the surface soil.\r\nThis boring to a depth of twenty inches was put into a second bag.\r\nThe hole was then enlarged to the twenty-inch depth but the\r\nadditional soil removed was discarded as a mixture of the surface\r\nand subsurface strata. Finally the hole was extended to the\r\nforty-inch depth and the subsoil from one groove of the auger was\r\nput into a third bag. In this manner about an equal quantity of soil\r\nwas bagged from each stratum; and twenty such borings taken with an\r\nauger about one inch in diameter make a sufficient quantity to\r\nfurnish to the chemist.\r\n\r\n\"Of course the surface soil is by far the most important,\" Percy\r\nexplained. \"It represents just about the depth of earth that is\r\nturned by the plow in good farming on normal soils; and it weighs\r\nabout two million pounds per acre. The subsurface stratum extending\r\nfrom six and two-thirds to twenty inches in depth represents the\r\npractical limit of subsoiling; and this stratum weighs about four\r\nmillion pounds; while the subsoil stratum weighs about six million\r\npounds, where the soil is normal, such as loam, silt loam, clay\r\nloam, or sandy loam. Pure sand soil weighs about one-fourth more,\r\nwhile pure peat soil weighs only half as much as normal soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would tell me,\" said Mr. Thornton, \"what the fertilizers\r\ncost that have been used on that Rothamsted wheat field.\"\r\n\r\n\"The annual application of nitrogen has been one hundred twenty-nine\r\npounds per acre,\" said Percy. \"What will it cost?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at twenty cents a pound, it would cost $25.80,\" was Mr.\r\nThornton's reply after he had figured a moment. \"But why didn't they\r\ngrow clover and get the nitrogen from the air?\"\r\n\r\n\"For two reasons,\" replied Percy. \"First, when those classic\r\nexperiments were begun by Sir John Lawes and Sir Henry Gilbert in\r\n1844, it was not known that clover could secure the free nitrogen\r\nfrom the air; and, second, the experiment was designed to discover\r\nfor certain whether wheat must be supplied with combined nitrogen,\r\nby ascertaining the actual effect upon the yield of wheat of the\r\nnitrogen applied.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was the actual effect of the nitrogen?\" questioned Mr.\r\nThornton. \"How much did the wheat yield when they left out the\r\nnitrogen and applied all the other elements?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only fifteen bushels,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Only fifteen bushels! Only two bushels increase for all the other\r\nelements, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and calcium,--and I\r\nremember you said that sulfur also was applied. Why didn't they\r\nleave off all these other elements, and just use the nitrogen\r\nalone?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did on another plot in the same field.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they did do that? What was the yield on that plot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only twenty bushels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only twenty bushels! Well, that s mighty queer. How do you account\r\nfor that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does Mrs. Thornton sometimes make dough out of flour and milk?\"\r\nasked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Another Yankee question, eh?\" said Mr. Thornton. \"I told my wife\r\nonce that I wished she could make the bread my mother used to make,\r\nand she said she wished I could make the dough her father used to\r\nmake. Yes, my wife makes dough, a good deal more than I do, and she\r\nmakes it of flour and milk, when we aren't reduced to corn meal and\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can she make dough of flour alone?\" continued Percy.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Nor of milk alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, wheat cannot be made of nitrogen alone, nor can it be made\r\nwithout nitrogen. On Broadbalk field at Rothamsted, where the wheat\r\nis grown, the soil is most deficient in the element nitrogen. In\r\nother words, nitrogen is the limiting element for wheat on that\r\nsoil; and practically no increase can be made in the yield of wheat\r\nunless nitrogen is added. However, some other elements are not\r\nfurnished by this soil in sufficient amount for the largest yield of\r\nwheat, and these place their limitation upon the crop at twenty\r\nbushels. To remove this second limitation requires that another\r\nelement, such as phosphorus, shall be supplied in larger amount than\r\nis anually liberated in the soil under the system of farming\r\npracticed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see that,\" said Mr. Thornton, \"it's like eating pancakes and\r\nhoney; the more cakes you have the more honey you want. I think I\r\ncan almost see my way through in this matter; we are to correct the\r\nacid with limestone, to work the legumes for nitrogen, and turn\r\nunder everything we can to increase the organic matter, and if we\r\nfind that the soil won't furnish enough phosphorus, potassium,\r\nmagnesium, or calcium, even with the help of the decaying organic\r\nmatter to liberate them, why then it is up to us to increase the\r\nsupply of those elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must remember that the calcium will be supplied in the\r\nlimestone;\" cautioned Percy. \"And, if you use magnesian limestone,\r\nyou will thus supply both calcium and magnesium. Keep in mind that\r\n_magnesian _only means that the limestone contains some _magnesium._\r\nand that it is not a pure calcium carbonate. The purest magnesian\r\nlimestone consists of a double carbonate of calcium and magnesium,\r\ncalled dolomite.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have heard that magnesian lime is bad for soils,\" said Mr.\r\nThornton.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" Percy replied, \"and so is ordinary lime bad for\r\nsoils. The Germans say: 'Lime makes the fathers rich but the\r\nchildren poor.' The English saying is:\r\n\r\n'Lime and lime without manure\r\nWill make both farm and farmer poor.'\r\n\r\n\"Both of these national proverbs are correct for common, every-day\r\nlime; but you know, do you not, that limestone soils are usually\r\nvery good and very durable soils?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I've always heard,\" replied Mr. Thornton.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is no danger whatever from using too much limestone;\r\nand all the information thus far secured shows that magnesian\r\nlimestone is even better than the pure calcium limestone. I know two\r\nIllinois farmers who are using large quantities of ground magnesian\r\nlimestone, and one of them has applied as much as twenty tons per\r\nacre. On that land his corn crop was good for eighty bushels per\r\nacre this year. Of course that heavy application was more than was\r\nneeded, but initial applications of four or five tons are very\r\nsatisfactory, and these should be followed by about two tons per\r\nacre every four to six years.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton took his guest to Blairville that evening as they had\r\nplanned and he assured Percy that should he decide to purchase land\r\nin that section they would let him have three hundred acres of their\r\nland at ten dollars an acre.\r\n\r\n\"I will let you know after I get the samples analyzed for you,\" said\r\nPercy. \"The price is low enough and the location ideal, but still I\r\nwant to have the invoice before I buy the goods. I will write you\r\nabout sending the samples to the chemist after I hear from some I\r\nsent him from Montplain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nFROM RICHMOND TO WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next day Percy spent a few hours at the State Capitol in\r\nRichmond, where he found the records of the State of much interest.\r\n\r\nThus he found that in practically every county there was more or\r\nless land owned by the commonwealth, because of its complete\r\nabandonment by former owners, and the failure of any one to buy when\r\nsold by the state for taxes.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions the title to the land returns to the State,\r\nand after two years it may be sold by the State to any one desiring\r\nto purchase and the former owner has no further right of redemption.\r\nSome of these lands which are owned by the State, and on which the\r\nState has received no taxes for many years, are still occupied by\r\ntheir former owners or by \"squatters\"' and may continue to be so\r\noccupied unless the land should be purchased from the State by some\r\none else who would demand full possession. Such purchasers, however,\r\nare likely to be unpopular residents in the community, if the\r\ntransaction forces poor people from a place they have called home,\r\neven though they had no legal right to occupy it.\r\n\r\nPercy found that the report of the State Auditor showed that the\r\nclerk of the court of Powhatan county had returned to the State\r\n$1.05 \"for sales of lands purchased by the commonwealth at tax\r\nsales,\" while from Prince Edward county the State received a similar\r\nrevenue amounting to $17.39 for the same year. The total revenue to\r\nthe commonwealth from this source amounted to $667.85 for the year.\r\nContrasted with this was the revenue from \"Redemption of Land,\"\r\namounting to $27,436.38, suggesting something of the struggle of the\r\nman to retain possession of his home before it becomes legally\r\npossible for another to take it from him beyond redemption.\r\n\r\nAccording to the records about a million acres of land are owned by\r\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia alone.\r\n\r\nPercy decided to go to Washington to learn what definite information\r\nhe might obtain from the United States Department of Agriculture. On\r\nthe train for Washington he found himself sitting beside a Virginia\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n\"These lands remind me of our Western prairies,\" Percy remarked.\r\n\"You have some extensive areas of level or gently undulating\r\nuplands.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't remind me of the Western prairies, I can tell you,\" was\r\nthe reply. \"I am a Westerner myself, or I was until eight years ago.\r\nThese lands look all right from the train when the crops are all\r\noff, but I find that every patch of the earth's surface doesn't\r\nalways make a good farm. Why you can go from Danville, Illinois, to\r\nOmaha, Nebraska, and stop anywhere in the darkest night and you're\r\nmighty near sure to light on a good farm where one acre is worth ten\r\nof this land along here.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what is this land worth?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought six hundred acres of it was worth $5,000 about\r\neight years ago, especially as the buildings on the place were in\r\ngood repair and couldn't be built to-day for less than $6,000: but\r\nright now I think I paid a plenty for my land. It's just back a few\r\nmiles at the station where I got on.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is that from Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"About fifteen miles, I reckon, as the crow flies. My boy has a\r\ntelescope his uncle sent him and we can see the Monument on a clear\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"What monument?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Washington's monument. Haven't you ever been to Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, this is my first visit. I am really thinking of buying a farm\r\nsomewhere here in the East. I have been in Richmond and learned a\r\ngreat deal from the state reports, and I thought I might get more\r\ninformation from the Department of Agriculture in Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said the man, \"but my advice is to keep in mind that\r\nthere is a difference between buying land and buying a farm. I've\r\ngot land to sell, by the way. I thought I'd need it all when I\r\nbought, but I can see now that I'll not need more'n half of it at\r\nthe most; so, if you want two or three hundred acres of this kind of\r\nland right close here where you kind o' neighbor with the senators\r\nand other upper tens, and run back and forth from the City in an\r\nhour or so, why I think I can accommodate you. My name is\r\nSunderland, J. R. Sunderland, and you'll find me at home any day.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much would you sell part of your land for?\" inquired Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'd kind o' hate to take less than ten dollars an acre for\r\nit; but I think we can make a deal all right if you like the\r\nlocation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA LESSON IN OPTIMISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT nine o'clock the day following Percy's arrival in Washington\r\nhe sent his card into the office of the Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\"Just step this way,\" said the boy on his return. \"The Secretary\r\nwill see you at once.\"\r\n\r\nA gentleman who appeared to be sixty, but was really several years\r\nolder, arose from his desk and greeted Percy very kindly.\r\n\r\n\"I see you are from Illinois, Mr. Johnston. I am an Iowa man myself,\r\nand I am always glad to see any one from the corn belt. Do you know\r\nwe are going to beat the records this year? It is wonderful what\r\ncrops we grow in this country, and they are getting better every\r\nyear. We are growing more than two-thirds of the entire corn crop of\r\nthe globe, right here in these United States. Yes, Sir, and we are\r\njust beginning to grow corn; and corn is only one of our important\r\nagricultural products. Do you know that eighty-six per cent. of all\r\nthe raw materials used in all the manufactured products of this\r\ncountry come from the farms of the United States; yes, Sir,\r\neighty-six per cent.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what can I do for you? I am very glad you called, and I will\r\nbe glad to serve you in any way you desire. By the way, how is the\r\ncorn turning out in your part of Illinois? Bumper crop, I have no\r\ndoubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" said Percy, \"after seeing the crops here in the East.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I thought,\" continued the Secretary.\" A bumper crop,\r\nthe biggest we ever raised. Oh, they don't know how to raise corn\r\nhere in the East. They just grow corn, corn, corn, year after year;\r\nand that will get any land out of fix. I found that out years ago in\r\nIowa. I am a farmer myself, as I suppose you know. I found you\r\ncouldn't grow corn on the same land all the time. But just rotate\r\nthe crops; put clover in the rotation; and then your ground will\r\nmake corn again, as good as ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I understand that clover refuses to grow on most of this\r\neastern land,\" said Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nonsense. They don't sow it. I tell you they don't sow it, and\r\nthey don't know how to raise it. It takes a little manure sometimes\r\nto start it, but it will grow all right if they would only give it\r\nhalf a chance. Why, for years the Iowa farmers said blue grass\r\nwouldn't grow in Iowa. Yes, Sir, they just knew it wouldn't grow\r\nthere; and then I showed them that blue grass was actually growing\r\nin Iowa,--actually growing along the roadsides almost\r\neverywhere,--blue grass that would pasture a steer to the acre--just\r\ncame in of itself without being seeded. No, I tell you they don't\r\nsow clover down here. They just say it won't grow and keep right on\r\nplanting corn, corn, corn, until the corn crop amounts to nothing,\r\nand then they let the land grow up in brush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I do not wish to take up more of your time,\" said Percy, \"for\r\nI know how busy a man you must be, but I am thinking of buying a\r\nfarm, or some land, here in the East and have come to you for\r\ninformation. We have a small farm in Illinois and land is rather too\r\nhigh-priced there to think of buying more; but I thought I could\r\nsell at a good price, and buy a much larger farm here in the East\r\nwith part of the money and still have enough left to build it up\r\nwith; and, with the high price of all kinds of farm produce here, we\r\nought to make it pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do it,\" said the Secretary. \"No doubt of it. Any land that\r\never was any good is all right yet if you'll grow clover, and you\r\ncan start that with a little manure if you need it. I have done it\r\nin Iowa, and I know what I am talking about.\r\n\r\n\"Now my Bureau of Soils can give you just the information you want.\r\nWe are making a soil survey of the United States, and we have soil\r\nmaps of several counties right here in Maryland. You can take that\r\nmap and pick out any kind of land you want,--upland or bottom\r\nland,--sandy soil, clay soil, loam, silt loam, or anything you\r\nwant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nIN THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SHOW this gentleman to the Bureau of Soils,\" said the Secretary to\r\nthe boy who came as he pushed a button.\r\n\r\n\"All the world loves an optimist,\" said Percy to himself as he\r\nfollowed the boy to another office where he met the Chief of the\r\nBureau of Soils, who kindly furnished him with copies of the soil\r\nmaps of several counties, including two in Maryland, Prince George,\r\nwhich adjoins the District of Columbia, and St. Mary county, which\r\nalmost adjoins Prince George on the South.\r\n\r\nThese maps were accompanied by extensive reports describing in some\r\ndetail the agricultural history of the counties and the general\r\nobservations that had been made by the soil surveyors.\r\n\r\n\"I desire to learn as much as I can regarding the most common upland\r\nsoils,\" Percy explained. \"Not the rough or broken land, but the\r\nlevel or undulating lands which are best suited for cultivation. I\r\nam sure these maps and reports will be a very great help to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you will find just what you are looking for,\" said the\r\nChief. \"You can spread the maps out on the table there and let me\r\nknow if I can be of any assistance. You see the legend on the margin\r\ngives you the name of every soil type, and the soils are fully\r\ndescribed in the reports. One of the most common uplands soils in\r\nsouthern Prince George county is the Leonardtown loam, and this type\r\nis also the most extensive soil type in St. Mary county.\r\n\r\n\"The same type is found in Virginia to some extent. While the soil\r\nhas been run down by improper methods of culture, it has a very good\r\nmechanical composition and is really an excellent soil; but it needs\r\ncrop rotation and more thorough cultivation to bring it back into a\r\nhigh state of fertility. The farmers are slow to take up advanced\r\nmethods here in the East. We have told them what they ought to do,\r\nbut they keep right on in the same old rut.\"\r\n\r\nFor two hours Percy buried himself with the maps and reports.\r\nFinally the Chief came from his inner office, and finding Percy\r\nstill there asked if he had found such information as he desired.\r\n\r\n\"I find much of interest and value, but I do not find any complete\r\ninvoice of the plant food contained in these different kinds of\r\nsoil.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean an ultimate chemical analysis of the soil?\" asked the\r\nChief.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a chemical analysis to ascertain the absolute amount of plant\r\nfood in the soil. I think of it as an invoice; but I see that you do\r\nnot report any such analyses.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we do not,\" answered the Chief. \"We have been investigating the\r\nmechanical composition of soils, the chemistry of the soil solution,\r\nand the adaptation of crop to soil. We find that farmers are not\r\ngrowing the crops they should grow; namely, the crops to which their\r\nsoils are best adapted. For example, they try to grow corn on land\r\nthat is not adapted to corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Percy, \"that our farmers are always trying to\r\nfind a crop that is adapted to their soil. Down in 'Egypt,' which\r\ncovers about one-third of Illinois, the farmers once raised so much\r\ncorn that the people from the swampy prairie went down there to buy\r\ncorn, and hence the name 'Egypt' became applied to Southern\r\nIllinois. But there came a time when the soil refused to grow such\r\ncrops of corn; the farmers then found that wheat was adapted to the\r\nsoil. Later the wheat yields decreased until the crop became\r\nunprofitable; and the farmers sought for another crop adapted to a\r\nstill more depleted soil. Timothy was selected, and for many years\r\nit proved a profitable crop; but of late years timothy likewise has\r\ndecreased in yield until there must be another change; and now whole\r\nsections of 'Egypt' are growing red top as the only profitable crop.\r\nAfter red top, then what? I don't know, but it looks as though it\r\nwould be sprouts and scrub brush, and final land abandonment, a\r\nrepetition of the history of these old lands of Virginia and\r\nMaryland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, can't they grow corn after red top?\" asked the Chief.\r\n\r\n\"Many of them try it many times,\" replied Percy, \"and the yield is\r\nabout twenty bushels per acre, whereas the virgin soil easily\r\nproduced sixty to eighty bushels.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they can't grow wheat as they once did?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, wheat after timothy or red top now yields from five to twelve\r\nbushels per acre, while they once grew twenty to thirty bushels of\r\nwheat per acre year after year.\r\n\r\n\"If they rotate their crops, they would probably yield as well as\r\never,\" said the Chief.\r\n\r\n\"No, that, too, has been tried,\" replied Percy. \"The Illinois\r\nExperiment Station has practiced a four-year rotation of corn,\r\ncowpeas, wheat, and clover on an experiment field on the common\r\nprairie soil down in 'Egypt,' and the average yield of wheat has\r\nbeen only twelve bushels per acre during the last four years, but\r\nwhen legume crops were plowed under and limestone and phosphorus\r\napplied, the average yield during the same four years was\r\ntwenty-seven bushels per acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably the increase was all produced by the green manure,\"\r\nsuggested the Chief. \"Organic matter has a great influence on the\r\ncontrol of the moisture supply.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was tested,\" said Percy. \"The green manure alone increased the\r\naverage yield to only fourteen bushels while the green manure and\r\nlimestone together raised the average wheat yield to nineteen\r\nbushels, the further increase to twenty-seven bushels having been\r\nproduced by the addition of phosphorus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir,\" said the Chief, \"we have made both extensive intensive\r\ninvestigations concerning the chemistry of the soil solution by very\r\ndelicate and sensitive methods of analysis we have developed, and we\r\nhave also conducted culture experiments for twenty-day periods with\r\nwheat seedlings in the water extract of soils from all parts of the\r\nUnited States, and the results we have obtained have changed the\r\nthought of the world as to the cause of the infertility of soils.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have not made analyses for total plant food in the soils or\r\nconducted actual field experiments with crops grown to maturity?\"\r\nasked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"No, we have not done that,\" answered the Chief. \"Those are old\r\nmethods of investigation which have been tried for many years and\r\nyet no chemist can tell in advance what will be the effect of a\r\ngiven fertilizer upon a given crop on a given soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Percy, \"but neither can any merchant tell in\r\nadvance just what effect will be produced on the next day's business\r\nby the addition of a given number of a given kind of shoes to a\r\ngiven stock on his shelves. There are many factors involved in both\r\ncases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are right in that,\" said the Chief, \"we are just beginning\r\nto understand the chemistry of the soil, and we hope soon to have\r\nvery complete proof of the advanced ideas we already have concerning\r\nthe causes of the fertility and infertility of soils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Referring to the specific case of the Leonardtown loam of\r\nMaryland,\" said Percy, \"I find the following statement on page 33 of\r\nthe Report of the Field Operations of the Bureau of Soils for 1900.\r\nAfter describing the Norfolk loam of St. Mary County, the writer\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"'The Leonardtown loam is a very much heavier type of soil. It\r\ncovers about forty-one per cent. of St. Mary County. The soil is a\r\nyellow silty soil, resembling loess in texture, underlaid by a clay\r\nsubsoil with layers or pockets of sand. This soil has been\r\ncultivated for upward of two hundred years, but it is now little\r\nvalued and is covered with oak and pine over much of its area. It is\r\nworth from $1 to $3 per acre. The cultivated areas produce small\r\ncrops of corn, wheat, and an inferior grade of tobacco.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The generally low estimation in which this land is held is probably\r\nwholly unjustified,\" replied the Chief. \"There are two or three\r\nfarms in the area which, under a high state of cultivation with\r\nintelligent methods, will produce from twenty to thirty bushels of\r\nwheat per acre and corresponding crops of corn. Those farmers are a\r\ncredit to the country. They furnish the towns with good milk and\r\nbutter and vegetables, and they also help to keep the towns clean\r\nand sanitary by hauling out the animal excrements, and other waste\r\nand garbage that tend to pollute the air and water of the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see how that might maintain the fertility of those farms,\"\r\nsaid Percy. \"It seems that the general condition of this kind of\r\nland is about the same in Prince George County. On page 45 of the\r\n1901 Report of the Field Operations of the Bureau of Soils, I have\r\nnoted the following statement:\r\n\r\n\"'The Leonardtown loam, covering 45,770 acres of the area, is the\r\nnearest approach among the Maryland Coastal Plain Soils to the heavy\r\nclays of the limestone regions of Western Maryland and Pennsylvania.\r\nThe surface is generally level and the drainage fair. The soil is\r\nnot adapted to tobacco, and has consequently been allowed to grow up\r\nto scrub forest, so that large portions of it are at present\r\nuncleared. Such unimproved lands can be bought for $1.50 to $5.00 an\r\nacre, even within a few miles of the District line. The soil has\r\nbeen badly neglected, and when cultivated the methods have not been\r\nsuch as to promote fertility. When properly handled, as it is in a\r\nfew places, good yields of wheat, corn and grass are obtained.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said the Chief, \"exactly right. Upon the whole it is\r\none of the most promising soils of the locality, although it is not\r\nconsidered so by the resident farmers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that it should be handled the same as is done by the\r\nsuccessful farmers of St. Mary County?\" inquired Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it needs thorough cultivation and the rotation of crops; and\r\nthe physical condition of the soil needs to be improved by the\r\naddition of lime and manure, or green crops turned under.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been looking over some of the other Reports of Field\r\nOperations,\" said Percy.\" I became interested in the description of\r\na Virginia soil called Porters black loam. I find the following\r\nstatements on page 210 of the Report for 1902:\r\n\r\n\"'The Porters black loam occurs in all the soil survey sheets,\r\nextending along the top of the main portion of the Blue Ridge\r\nMountains in one continuous area. This type consists of the broad\r\nrolling tops and the upper slopes of the main range of the Blue\r\nRidge Mountains. Locally the Porters black loam is called \"black\r\nland\" and \"pippin\" land, the latter term being applied because, of\r\nall the soils of the area, it is pre-eminently adapted to the\r\nNewtown and Albermarle Pippin. This black land has long been\r\nrecognized as the most fertile of the mountain soils. It can be\r\nworked year after year without apparent impairment of its fertility.\r\nWheat winter kills, the loose soils heaving badly under influence of\r\nfrost. The areas lie at too high elevations for corn. Oats do well,\r\nmaking large yields. Irish potatoes, even under ordinary culture,\r\nwill yield from two hundred to three hundred bushels per acre. It\r\nseeds in blue grass naturally, which affords excellent pasturage.\r\nClover and other grasses will also grow luxuriantly upon it. The\r\nareas occupied by this soil are mostly cleared.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" said the Chief, \"the Potters black loam is a fine\r\nsoil--loose and porous as stated in the Report. You see it has a\r\ngood physical condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one other description in this Report for 1903 that is of\r\nspecial interest to me,\" said Percy. \"This relates to a type of soil\r\nwhich the surveyors found in the low level areas of prairie land in\r\nMcLean County, Illinois, and which they have called Miami black clay\r\nloam. I think we have several acres of the same kind of soil on our\r\nown little farm. I found the following statements on page 787:\r\n\r\n\"'When the first settlers came to McLean County they found the areas\r\noccupied by the Miami black clay loam wet and swampy, and before\r\nthese areas could be brought under cultivation it was necessary to\r\nremove the excess of moisture. With the exception of a few large\r\nditches for outlets, tile drains have taken the place of open\r\nditches. Drainage systems in some instances have cost as much as $25\r\nan acre, but the very productive character of the soil, and the\r\nincrease in the yields fully justify the expense. There are few\r\nsoils more productive than the Miami black clay loam. Some areas\r\nhave been cropped almost continuously in corn for nearly fifty years\r\nwithout much diminution in the yields.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Now there you are again,\" said the Chief. \"Drainage, that's all it\r\nneeded. You see it's a simple matter; and that's what the\r\nLeonardtown loam needs in places. Give it good drainage and good\r\ncultivation with a rotation of crops, and you'll get results all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the Bureau of Soils tried these methods on any of this soil\r\nnear Washington?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" replied the Chief. \"We've got the scientific facts and\r\nbesides, as I told you, some few farms are kept up in both Prince\r\nGeorge and St. Mary counties and they are as good demonstrations as\r\nanyone could want. Now I suggest that you meet some of our\r\nscientists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMIST'S LABORATORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Chief showed Percy into the laboratories of the Bureau and\r\nintroduced him to the soil physicist and the soil chemist. Percy was\r\ngreatly interested in the various lines of work in progress and\r\ngladly accepted an invitation to return after lunch and become\r\nbetter acquainted with the methods of investigation used.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the physicist showed him how the soil water could\r\nbe removed from an ordinary moist soil by centrifugal force, and the\r\nchemist was growing wheat seedlings in small quantities of this\r\nwater and in water extracts contained in bottles. The seedlings were\r\nallowed to grow for twenty days and then other seedlings were\r\nstarted in the same solution and also in fresh solution, and it was\r\nvery apparent that in some cases the wheat grew better in the fresh\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nThe chemist explained that he also analyzed the soil solutions and\r\nwater extracts from different soils and that there was no relation\r\nbetween the crop yields and the chemical composition of the soils.\r\n\r\n\"But it seems to me,\" said Percy, \"that your analysis refers to the\r\nplant food dissolved in the soil water only at the time when you\r\nextract it. How long a time does it require to make the extraction?\"\r\n\r\n\"As a rule we shake the soil with water for three minutes and then\r\nit takes twenty minutes to separate the water from the soil. This\r\ngives us the plant food in solution and with the addition of more\r\nwater the nitrates, phosphoric acid, and potash in the soil\r\nimmediately dissolve sufficiently give us a nutrient solution of the\r\nsame concentration as we had before. Thus there is always sufficient\r\nplant food in the soil so long as there is any of the original\r\nstock.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is surely quick work,\" said Percy, \"but I wonder if the corn\r\nplant might not get somewhat different results from the soil\r\nanalysis which it makes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever plant a field of corn and then cultivate it and watch\r\nit grow with increasing rapidity, until along about the Fourth of\r\nJuly every leaf seemed to nod its appreciation and thanks as you\r\nstirred the soil; and to show its gratitude, too, by growing about\r\nfive inches every twenty-four hours when the nights were warm?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Chemist, \"I have never had any experience of that\r\nsort. I am devoting my life to the more scientific investigations\r\nrelating to the fundamental laws which underlie these soil fertility\r\nproblems.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was only thinking,\" Percy continued, \"that you analyze a\r\nfraction of a pound of soil in a few minutes, while the corn plant\r\nanalyzes about a ton of soil by a sort of continuous process, which\r\ncovers twenty-four hours every day for about one hundred and twenty\r\ndays, and it takes into account every change in temperature and\r\nmoisture, the aeration with any variation produced by cultivation,\r\nand also the changes brought about by the nitrifying bacteria and\r\nall other agencies that promote the decomposition of the soil and\r\nthe liberation of plant food, including the action upon the\r\ninsoluble phosphates and other minerals of the carbonic acid exhaled\r\nby the roots of the corn plants, the nitric acid produced by the\r\nprocess of nitrification, and the various acids resulting from the\r\ndecay of organic matter contained in the soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very familiar with the literature of the whole subject of soil\r\nfertility,\" replied the Chemist, \"and our theories are being\r\naccepted everywhere. I have just returned from a lecture tour\r\nextending from Florida to Michigan, and our ideas and methods are\r\nbeing very generally adopted, not only in this country but also in\r\nEurope.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Chief of the Bureau very kindly permitted me to look over the\r\nmaps and reports relating to the soils of Maryland and Virginia,\"\r\nsaid Percy, \"but in this literature I found no data as to the amount\r\nof plant food contained in the various soil types that have been\r\nfound in the surveys. May I ask if the Bureau has made any analyses\r\nto ascertain the total amounts of the different essential plant food\r\nelements contained in these different soils?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the Chemist replied, \"a chemical analysis gives practically no\r\ninformation concerning the fertility of the soil. We have made no\r\nultimate analyses of soils, although we have used the same methods\r\nof analysis in a study of the partial composition of the soil\r\nseparates, or particles of different grades, such as the sand, the\r\nsilt, and the clay.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you also determined the percentages of sand, silt, and\r\nclay in the soils themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, the physical composition of the soil is a matter of very\r\ngreat importance, and this is always determined and reported for\r\nevery soil. Did you not see that in the Reports you examined this\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I did notice it,\" Percy replied, \"but it is so easy for the\r\nfarmer himself to tell a sandy soil from a clay soil that I did not\r\nappreciate the value of those physical analyses.\r\n\r\n\"In any case, I shall be very glad to know what results were\r\nobtained from the chemical analysis of the soil separates to which\r\nyou referred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those results are all reported in Bulletin No. 54 of the Bureau of\r\nSoils,\" said the Chemist, \"and I have extra copies right here and\r\nwill be glad to present you with one. And let me give you our\r\nBulletin 22 also. This will enable you to get a clear idea of the\r\nprinciples we are developing which are solving the soil fertility\r\nproblems that have completely baffled the scientists heretofore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICS APPLIED TO AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY left the Bureau of Soils with a feeling of deep appreciation\r\nfor the uniform courtesy and kindness that had been accorded him,\r\nbut with a firm conviction that the laboratory scientists were too\r\nfar removed from the actual conditions existing in the cultivated\r\nfield. He sought the quiet of his room at the hotel in order to\r\nstudy the bulletins he had received.\r\n\r\nEven with his college training he found it difficult to form clear\r\nmental conceptions of the results of investigations reported in the\r\nbulletins. Sometimes the data were reported in percentages and\r\nsometimes in parts per million. No reports gave the amounts of the\r\nelement phosphorus; but PO4 was given in some places and P2O5 in\r\nothers. In Bulletin No. 22, the potassium and calcium were reported\r\nas the elements and the nitrogen in terms of NO3, while potash\r\n(K20), quicklime (CaO), and magnesia (MgO) were reported in Bulletin\r\n54.\r\n\r\nBy a somewhat complicated mathematical process, he finally succeeded\r\nin making computations from the percentages of the various compounds\r\nreported in the soil separates and from the percentages of these\r\ndifferent separates contained in the soils themselves and from the\r\nknown weights of normal soils, until he reduced the data to amounts\r\nper acre of plowed soil.\r\n\r\nHe was especially pleased to find that the essential data were at\r\nhand not only for both the Leonardtown loam and the Porter's black\r\nloam, but also for the Norfolk loam, which he had learned from one\r\nof the soil maps was the principal type of soil southwest of\r\nBlairville on Mr. Thornton's farm; and, furthermore, the Miami black\r\nclay loam of Illinois was included. Percy knew the black clay loam\r\nwas a rich soil, for the teacher in college had said that the more\r\ncommon prairie land and most timber lands were much less durable and\r\nneeded thorough investigation at once, while the flat recently\r\ndrained heavy black land could wait a few years if necessary.\r\n\r\nPercy first worked out the data for the Miami black clay loam. The\r\nchemist had analyzed the soil separates for only four constituents,\r\nand they showed the following amounts per acre of plowed soil to a\r\ndepth of six and two-thirds inches, averaging two million pounds in\r\nweight:\r\n\r\n2,970 pounds of phosphorus\r\n\r\n38,500 pounds of potassium\r\n\r\n18,440 pounds of magnesium\r\n\r\n46,200 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\nHe then made the computations for the average of the Leonardtown\r\nloam of St. Mary County, Maryland, with results as follows:\r\n\r\n160 pounds of phosphorus\r\n\r\n18,500 pounds of potassium\r\n\r\n3,480 pounds of magnesium\r\n\r\n1,000 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\nPercy stared at these figures when he brought them together for\r\ncomparison. He then checked up his computations to be sure they were\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\"Almost twenty times as much phosphorus!\" he said to himself. \"Is it\r\npossible? And more than forty times as much calcium! Let me see! It\r\ntakes one hundred and seventeen pounds of calcium for four tons of\r\nclover hay. The total amount in the plowed soil of the Leonardtown\r\nloam would not be sufficient for eight such crops; and six crops of\r\ncorn such as we raised one year on our sixteen acres would take more\r\nphosphorus from the land than is now left in the plowed soil of this\r\nLeonardtown loam. The magnesium is not quite so bad--about one-fifth\r\nas much as in our black soil, and the potassium is almost one-half\r\nas much as we have.\"\r\n\r\nPercy next turned to the Porters black loam, which he had noticed\r\nwas to be found not many miles from Montplain. He thought he might\r\ninduce Mr. West to drive with him to the upper mountain slope in\r\norder that they might see that land. His computations for the\r\nPorters black loam gave the following results:\r\n\r\n4,630 pounds of phosphorus\r\n\r\n48,300 pounds of potassium\r\n\r\n12,360 pounds of magnesium\r\n\r\n23,700 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\nHe viewed these figures a moment with evident satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of everything in this wonderful 'pippin land,'\" he thought.\r\n\"Big yields reported for everything suited to that altitude. 'Can be\r\nworked year after year without apparent impairment of its\r\nfertility,' so the Report stated. I should think it might,\r\nespecially since clover is one of the crops grown. Both phosphorus\r\nand potassium are way above our best black land. Magnesium\r\ntwo-thirds and calcium one-half of our flat land, but still greater\r\nthan our common prairie, according to the average they gave us at\r\ncollege. And no doubt there is plenty of magnesian limestone in\r\nthese mountains which could be had if ever needed. The soil surveyor\r\ncertainly did not say too much in praise of the Porters black loam,\r\nconsidering that its physical composition is also all right.\"\r\n\r\nHe worked out the Norfolk loam to see what he would get if he\r\naccepted Miss Russell's dare. The following are the figures:\r\n\r\n610 pounds of phosphorus\r\n\r\n13,200 pounds of potassium\r\n\r\n1,200 pounds of magnesium\r\n\r\n3,430 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\n\"Rather low in everything,\" said Percy, \"compared with any soil I\r\nknow that has a good reputation. More uniformly poor but not so\r\nextremely poor as the Leonardtown loam.\"\r\n\r\nHe wished that the nitrogen had been determined by the chemist, even\r\nthough he knew the organic matter and the nitrogen must be very low\r\nin the poor soils, but nowhere was any such record to be found in\r\nthe bulletin. He found the statement, however, that all data were\r\nreported on the basis of ignited soil.\r\n\r\n\"That will reduce some of these amounts about one-tenth,\" he said to\r\nhimself. \"In our physics work in college, good soils generally lost\r\nabout ten per cent. in weight by ignition, even after all\r\nhygroscopic moisture had been expelled; but these very poor soils\r\nhaven't much to lose, I guess. They surely contain no carbonates and\r\nvery little organic matter, although they may contain some combined\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE NATION'S CAPITOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY spent three days in Washington.\r\n\r\n\"If I lived here long,\" he wrote his mother, \"I think I should\r\nbecome as optimistic as the Secretary of Agriculture, even though\r\nthe total produce of the original thirteen states should supply a\r\nstill smaller fraction of the necessities of life required by their\r\npopulation. The Congressional Library is by far the finest structure\r\nI have ever seen. I cannot help feeling proud that I am an American\r\nwhen I walk through its halls and look upon the portraits of the\r\ngreat men who helped to make our country truly great.\r\n\r\n\"As I shook hands with the President of the United States at one of\r\nhis public receptions held in the 'East Room' of the White House, I\r\nwondered if there was another country on the earth where the\r\nhumblest subject could thus come face to face with the head of a\r\nmighty nation. In the Treasury Building I was permitted to join a\r\nsmall party of some distinction and shared with each of them the\r\nprivilege of holding in my hands for a moment eight million dollars\r\nin government bonds.\r\n\r\n\"I have visited many of the great buildings, the Capitol, of course,\r\nand Washington's monument, which rises to a height of 555 feet above\r\nthe surrounding land, or practically 600 feet above low-water level\r\nin the Potomac. There are many smaller monuments erected in honor of\r\nAmerican heroes in various squares, circles, and parks throughout\r\nthe City.\r\n\r\n\"The zoological garden took a full half-day, and I could have spent\r\na much longer time there. They told me of a frightful occurrence\r\nthat happened only last week. In a pool of water a very large\r\nalligator is kept confined by a low stout iron fence. A negro woman\r\nwas leaning over the fence holding her baby in her arms and looking\r\nat the monster who seemed to be asleep; when, without a moment's\r\nwarning, he thrust himself half out of the water and snapped the\r\nbaby from her arms, swallowing it at one gulp as he settled back\r\ninto the water. I fear the report is true enough, for they have made\r\nthe fence higher in a very temporary manner, and I heard it\r\nmentioned by a dozen or more.\r\n\r\n\"I leave Washington by boat at five o'clock this afternoon, and I\r\nexpect to land at Leonardtown, St. Mary county, Maryland, about six\r\no'clock in the morning, when the boat will be ready to leave that\r\nport. It is a freight boat and stops for hours at large towns.\r\n\r\n\"I am planning for a trip into New England next week. I did not\r\nrealize how easy it is to go there until I looked up the train\r\nservice. In less than twelve hours' time, one can make the trip from\r\nthe Virginia line, through the District of Columbia, Maryland,\r\nDelaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode\r\nIsland, and into Massachusetts,--ten different states, including the\r\nDistrict. The trip from Galena to Cairo can hardly be made in so\r\nshort a time, not even on the limited Illinois Central trains.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour before leaving the Washington hotel Percy chanced to meet a\r\nCongressman whom he had seen on several occasions at the University\r\nand who had spoken at the alumni banquet at the time of Percy's\r\ngraduation.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very glad you introduced yourself, Mr. Johnston,\" said he.\r\n\"Want to get a place down here, do you? Very likely I can help you\r\nsome. I've helped several friends of mine to get good places. What\r\nare you after ?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of getting a place of about three hundred acres,\"\r\nsaid Percy, \"and I shall certainly appreciate any assistance or\r\ninformation you can give me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whe-e-ew. What are you up to? Want to sell us a site for the new\r\nGovernment insane hospital, or going to lay out another addition to\r\nthe city?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" replied Percy. \"I am looking for a piece of cheap land\r\nthat I can build up and make into a good farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ho!\" said the Congressman. \"That's it, is it? Well, now let me\r\ntell you that you've struck the wrong neck of the woods to find land\r\nthat you can make a good farm out of. The land about here is cheap\r\nenough all right--cheaper than the votes of some politicians, but it\r\ncan't be built up into good farms. Don't attempt the impossible, my\r\nfriend. If you want cheap land for town sites or insane hospitals,\r\nright here's the country to land in; but if you want a good farm,\r\nyou stay right in Illinois, or else follow Horace Greeley's advice\r\nand 'go West.'. That's a good suggestion for you, too. Just go West\r\nand get three hundred and twenty acres of the richest soil lying out\r\nof doors.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not much land left in the West where the rainfall is\r\nsufficient for good crops,\" said Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Then take irrigated land. The Government is getting under way some\r\nbig irrigation projects, and you ought to get in on the ground floor\r\non one of those tracts. It is a fact that the apples from some of\r\nthose irrigated farms sometimes bring more than $500 an acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't doubt that,\" said Percy. \"An illustration or example can\r\nusually be found to prove almost anything. I know that the Perrine\r\nBrothers, who conduct a fruit farm down in 'Egypt,' actually\r\nreceived $800 per acre for the apples grown on thirteen acres one\r\nyear; and there is plenty of such land in Egypt that can be bought\r\nfor less than $40 an acre, and near to the great markets. I am told,\r\nhowever, that there are from a dozen to a hundred applicants for\r\nevery farm opened to settlement in the West in these years, and it\r\nis estimated that all of the arid lands that can ever be put under\r\nirrigation in the United States will provide homes for no more than\r\nour regular increase in population in five years, and that the only\r\nother remaining rich lands--the swamp areas--will be occupied by the\r\nincrease of ten years in our population. It has seemed to me that it\r\nis high time we came back to these partially worn-out Eastern lands\r\nand begin to build them up. Here the rainfall is abundant, the\r\nclimate is fine, and the markets are the best, and there are\r\nmillions of acres of these Eastern lands that lie as nicely for\r\nfarming as the Western prairies. Why should they not be built up\r\ninto good farms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, let me give you a little fatherly advice,\" said the\r\nCongressman, laying his hand on Percy's shoulder. \"I tell you this\r\nland never was any good. If the East and South hadn't been settled\r\nfirst, they never would have been settled. Poor land remains poor\r\nland, and good land remains good land; and if you want to farm good\r\nland, you better stay right in the corn belt. You can't grow\r\nanything on these Eastern lands without fertilizer and the more you\r\nfertilize the more you must, and still the land remains as poor as\r\never. Just leave off the fertilizer one year and your crop is not\r\nworth harvesting. These lands never were any good and they never\r\nwill be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is hardly in accord with what the people now living on\r\nthese old Eastern farms report for the conditions of agriculture in\r\nthe times of their ancestors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know people are always talking about their ancestors,\r\nand especially Virginians; but, Caesar! I wonder what their\r\nancestors would think of them! You can't afford to take any stock in\r\nthe ancestry of these old Virginians.\"\r\n\r\n\"I call to mind that the historical records give much information\r\nalong this line,\" said Percy. \"It is recorded that mills for\r\ngrinding corn and wheat were common, that the flour of Mount Vernon\r\nwas packed under the eye of Washington, and we are told that barrels\r\nof flour bearing his brand passed in the export markets without\r\ninspection. History records that the plantations of Virginia usually\r\npassed from father to son, according to the law of entail, and that\r\nthe heads of families lived like lords, keeping their stables of\r\nblooded horses and rolling to church or town in their coach and six,\r\nwith outriders on horseback. Their spacious mansions were sometimes\r\nbuilt of imported brick; and, within, the grand staircases, the\r\nmantles, and the wainscot reaching from floor to ceiling, were of\r\nsolid mahogany, elaborately carved and paneled. The sideboards shone\r\nwith gold and silver plate, and the tables were loaded with the\r\nluxuries from both the New and the Old World, and plenty of these\r\nold mansions still exist in dilapidated condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"That all sounds good for history,\" said the Congressman, \"but the\r\nhistorian probably got his information from some of these old\r\nVirginians whose only religion is ancestral worship. If the lands\r\nwere ever any good they'd be good now. Good lands stay good. As an\r\nIllinois man, you ought to know that. My father settled in Illinois\r\nand I tell you his land is better to-day than it was the day he took\r\nit from the Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"My grandfather also took land from the Government,\" said Percy,\r\n\"but the land that he first put under cultivation is not producing\r\nas good crops now as it used to, even though--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it must be you don't farm it right. Of course you don't want\r\nto corn your land to death. I lived on the farm long enough to learn\r\nthat; but if you'll only grow two or three crops of corn and then\r\nchange to a crop of oats, you'll find your land ready for corn\r\nagain; and, if you'll sow clover with the oats and plow the clover\r\nunder the next spring, you'll find the land will grow more corn than\r\never your grandfather grew on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can we maintain the supply of plant food in the soil by\r\nmerely substituting oats for corn once in three or four years and\r\nturning under perhaps a ton of clover as green manure. That amount\r\nof clover would contain no more nitrogen than 40 bushels of corn\r\nwould remove from the soil, and of course the clover has no power to\r\nadd any phosphorus or other mineral elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I've heard all about that sort of talk. You know I'm a U.\r\nof I. man myself. I studied chemistry in the University under a man\r\nwho knew more in a minute than all the 'tommy rot' you've been\r\nfilled up with. I also lived on an Illinois farm, and I speak from\r\npractical experience. I know what I am talking about, and I don't\r\ncare a rap for all the theories that can be stacked up by your\r\nmodern college professor, who wouldn't know a pumpkin if he met one\r\nrolling down hill. I tell you God Almighty never made the black corn\r\nbelt land to be worn out, and he doesn't create people on this earth\r\nto let 'em starve to death. Don't you understand that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that I do not,\" replied Percy. \"I have received no such\r\ndirect communication; but I saw a letter written from China by a\r\nmissionary describing the famine-stricken districts in which he was\r\nlocated. He wrote the letter in February and said that at that time\r\nthe only practical thing to do in that district was to let four\r\nhundred thousand people starve and try to get seed grain for the\r\nremainder to plant the spring crops. I have a \"Handbook of Indian\r\nAgriculture\" written by a professor of agriculture and agricultural\r\nchemistry at one of the colleges in India. I got it from one of the\r\nHindu students who attended the University when I was there. This\r\nbook states that famine, local or general, has been the order of the\r\nday in India, and particularly within recent years. It also states\r\nthat in one of the worst famines in India ten million people died of\r\nstarvation within nine months. The average wage of the laboring man\r\nin India, according to the Governmental statistics, is fifty cents a\r\nmonth, and in famine years the price of wheat has risen to as high\r\nas $3.60 a bushel. This writer states that the most recent of all\r\nfamines; namely, that prevailing in most parts of India from 1897 to\r\n1900, was severer than the famine of 1874 to 1878. No, Sir, I am not\r\nsure that I understand just what God's intentions are concerning the\r\ncorn belt, but it is recorded that the Lord helps him who helps\r\nhimself, and that man should earn his bread by the sweat of his\r\nbrow. If God made the common soil in America with a limited amount\r\nof phosphorus in it, He also stored great deposits of natural rock\r\nphosphate in the mines of several States, and perhaps intended that\r\nman should earn his bread by grinding that rock and applying it to\r\nthe soil. Possibly the Almighty intended--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I'm very sorry, Mr. Johnston, but I have an engagement which I\r\nmust keep, and you'll have to excuse me just now. I'm mighty glad to\r\nhave met you and I'd like to talk with you for an hour more along\r\nthis line; but you take my advice and stick to the corn belt land.\r\nAbove all, don't begin to use phosphates or any sort of commercial\r\nfertilizer; they'll ruin any land in a few years; that's my opinion.\r\nBut then, every man has a right to his own opinion. and perhaps you\r\nhave a different notion. Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think no man has a right to an opinion which is contrary to\r\nfact,\" Percy replied. \"This whole question is one of facts and not\r\nof opinions. One fact is worth more than a wagonload of incorrect\r\nopinions. But I must not detain you longer. I am very glad to have\r\nmet you here. In large measure the statesmen of America must bear\r\nthe responsibility for the future condition of agriculture and the\r\nother great industries of the United States, all of which depend\r\nupon agriculture for their support and prosperity. Good bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll agree with you there all right; the farmer feeds them all.\r\nGood bye.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nA LESSON ON TOBACCO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY found Leonardtown almost in the center of St. Mary county,\r\nsituated on Breton bay, an arm of the lower Potomac.\r\n\r\nFrom the data recorded on the back of his map of Maryland, Percy\r\nnoted that a population of four hundred and fifty-four found support\r\nin this old county seat, according to the census of I 900. After\r\nspending the day in the country, he found himself wondering how even\r\nthat number of people could be supported, and then remembered that\r\nthere is one industry of some importance in the United States which\r\nexists independent of agriculture, an industry which preceded\r\nagriculture, and which evidently has also succeeded agriculture to a\r\nvery considerable extent in some places; namely, fishing.\r\n\r\n\"Clams, oysters and fish, and in this order,\" he said to himself,\r\n\"apparently constitute the means of support for some of these\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet the country was not depopulated, although very much of the\r\narable land was abandoned for agricultural purposes. A farm of a\r\nhundred acres might have ten acres under cultivation, this being as\r\nmuch as the farmer could \"keep up,\" as was commonly stated. This\r\nmeant that all of the farm manure and other refuse that could be\r\nsecured from the entire farm or hauled from the village, together\r\nwith what commercial fertilizer the farmer was able to buy, would\r\nnot enable him to keep more than ten acres of land in a state of\r\nproductiveness that justified its cultivation. Tobacco, corn, wheat\r\nand cowpeas were the principal crops. Corn was the principal article\r\nof food, with wheat bread more or less common. The cowpeas and corn\r\nfodder usually kept one or more cows through the winter when they\r\ncould not secure a living in the brush. Tobacco, the principal \"money\r\ncrop,\" was depended on to buy clothing, and \"groceries,\" which\r\nincluded more or less fish and pork, although some farmers \"raised\r\ntheir own meat,\" in part by fattening hogs on the acorns that fell\r\nin the autumn from the scrub oak trees.\r\n\r\nOne farm of one hundred and ninety acres owned by an old lady, who\r\nlived in the nearby country village was rented for $100 a year,\r\nwhich amounted to about fifty-two and one-half cents an acres as the\r\ngross income to the landowner. After the taxes were paid, about\r\nthirty cents an acre remained for repairs on buildings and fences\r\nand interest on the investment.\r\n\r\nPercy spent some time on a five hundred acre farm belonging to an\r\nold gentleman who still gave his name as F. Allerton Jones, a man\r\nwhose father had been prominent in the community. According to the\r\ncounty soil map which had been presented to Percy by the Bureau of\r\nSoils, the soil of this farm was all Leonardtown loam, except about\r\nforty acres which occupied the sides of a narrow valley a bend of\r\nwhich cut the farm on the south side.\r\n\r\n\"My father had this whole farm under cultivation,\" said Mr. Jones,\r\n\"except the hillsides. But what's the use? We get along with a good\r\ndeal less work, and I've found it better to cultivate less ground\r\nduring the forty odd years I've had to meet the bills. But I've kept\r\nup more of my land than most of my neighbors. I reckon I've got\r\nabout eighty acres of good cleared land yet on this farm, and the\r\nleaves and pine needles we rake up where the trees grow on the old\r\nfields make a good fertilizer for the land we aim to cultivate, and\r\nI get a good many loads of manure from friends who live in the\r\nvillage and keep a cow or a horse.\r\n\r\n\"The last crop I raised on that east field, where you see those\r\nscrub pines, was in 1881. I finished cultivating corn there the day\r\nI heard about President Garfield being shot; and it was a mighty hot\r\nJuly day too. My neighbor, Seth Whitmore, who died about ten years\r\nago, came along from the village and waited for me to come to the\r\nend of the row down by the road and he told me that Garfield was\r\nshot. We both allowed the corn would be a pretty fair crop and when\r\nI gathered the fodder that fall there was a right smart of a corn\r\ncrop. Yes, Sir, it's pretty good land, but we don't need much corn,\r\nno how, and we can make more money out of tobacco. Of course it\r\ntakes lots of manure and fertilizer to grow a good patch of tobacco,\r\nbut good tobacco always brings good money.\"\r\n\r\n\"About how much money do you get for an acre of tobacco?\" asked\r\nPercy.\r\n\r\n\"That varies a lot with the quality and price--sometimes\r\n$100--sometimes $300, when the trust don't hold the price down on\r\nus. We can raise good tobacco and good tobacco brings us good money.\r\nWe can always manure an acre or two for tobacco and get our\r\ngroceries and some clothes now and then, and that's about all\r\nanybody gets in this world, I reckon. But taxes are mighty high, I\r\ntell you. About $75 to $80 I have to pay. Are taxes high out West?\"\r\n\r\n\"We pay about forty to fifty cents an acre in the corn belt,\" Percy\r\nreplied; \"but, in a course I took in economics, I learned that the\r\ntaxes do not vary in proportion to land values. Poor lands, if\r\ninhabited, must always pay heavy taxes; whereas, large areas of good\r\nland carry lighter taxes compared with their earning capacity. You\r\nmust provide your regular expenses for county officers, county\r\ncourthouse, jail, and poorhouse, about the same as we do. Your roads\r\nand bridges cost as much as ours; and the schools in the South must\r\ncost more than ours, for a complete double system of schools is\r\nusually provided.\r\n\r\n\"But did you say that you paid fifty cents an acre in taxes?\" asked\r\nMr. Jones.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about that, in the corn belt,\" replied Percy, \"but not so much\r\nin Southern Illinois where the land is poor. I think the farmers in\r\nthat section pay taxes as low as yours. Perhaps twenty cents an\r\nacre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that you have poor land in Illinois?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the common prairie land of Southern Illinois must be called\r\npoor as compared with the corn belt land. There is a good deal of\r\nland in Southern Illinois that was put under cultivation before\r\n1820, and eighty crops must have made a heavy draft upon the store\r\nof plant food originally contained in those soils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only since 1820? Why, we began to till the soil right here, Young\r\nMan, in St. Mary County, in 1634 and don't you know, Sir, that we\r\nhad a rebellion here as early as 1645? Yes, Sir, that was one\r\nhundred and seventy-five years before 1820. So you've raised only\r\neighty crops and the land is already getting poor, and we've raised\r\ntwo hundred and fifty crops--well, maybe, not quite so many, for\r\nwe've been giving our land a good deal of rest for the last fifty or\r\nsixty years; but my grandfather used to raise twenty-five bushels of\r\nwheat to the acre with the help of a hundred pounds of land-plaster,\r\nand I've no doubt I could do it again today if I cared to raise\r\nwheat, but one acre of tobacco is worth ten of wheat, so why should\r\nI bother with wheat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five bushels of wheat per acre,\" repeated Percy, half to\r\nhimself. \"The total supply of phosphorus still remaining in the\r\nplowed soil would be sufficient for only twenty more crops like\r\nthat. Two hundred years of such crops would require 1600 pounds of\r\nphosphorus, making nearly 1800 pounds at the beginning, if it all\r\ncame from the plowed soil. That is one and a half times as much as\r\nis now contained in our common corn belt prairie land.\"\r\n\r\n\"More stuff in our land than in yours, did you say?\" questioned the\r\nold man. \"I told you we had pretty good soil here, but I've always\r\nallowed your soil was better, but maybe not. I tell you manure lasts\r\non this land. You can see where you put it for nigh twenty years.\r\nThen we rest our land some and that helps a sight, and if the price\r\nstays up we make good money on tobacco. I'm sorry your land is\r\ngetting so poor out West, especially if you can't raise tobacco.\r\nEver tried tobacco, Young Man?--gosh, but you remind me of one of\r\nthem Government fellows who came driving along here once when Bob\r\nand his brothers were plowing corn right here about three years ago.\r\nBob's my tenant's nigger, and he ain't no fool either, even if he is\r\ncolored; but then, to tell the truth, he ain't much colored. Well, I\r\nwas sitting under a tree right here smoking and keeping an eye on\r\nthe niggers unbeknownst to them when one of them Government fellows\r\nstopped his horse as Bob was turning the end, and says he to Bob:\r\n\r\n\"'Your corn seems to be looking mighty yellow?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, suh,' says Bob. 'Yes, suh, we done planted yellow corn.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, I mean it looks as though you won't get more than half a\r\ncrop,' says he.\r\n\r\n\"'I reckon not,' says Bob. 'The landlord, he done gets the other\r\nhalf.'\r\n\r\n\"With that the fellow says to Bob:\r\n\r\n\"'It seems to me you're mighty near a fool.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, suh,' says Bob, 'and I'm mighty feared I'll catch it if I\r\ndon't get a goin'.'\r\n\r\n\"The fellow just gave his horse a cut and drove on, but I liked to\r\ndied. He'd been here two or three times pestering me with questions\r\nabout raising tobacco. Say, you ain't one of them Government\r\nfellows, are you? They were travelling all around over this county\r\nthree years ago, learning how we raised tobacco and all kinds of\r\ncrops. They had augers and said they were investigating soils, but I\r\nnever heard nothing of 'em since. Have you got an auger to\r\ninvestigate soils with?\"\r\n\r\nPercy was compelled to admit that he had an auger and that he was\r\ntrying to learn all he could about the soil.\r\n\r\nHe had driven to Mr. Jones' farm because his land happened to be\r\nsituated in a large area of Leonardtown loam, and he felt free to\r\nstop and talk with him because he had found him leaning against the\r\nfence, smoking a cob pipe, apparently trying to decide what to do\r\nwith some small shocks of corn scattered over a field of about\r\nfifteen acres.\r\n\r\nPercy stepped to the buggy and drew out his soil auger, then\r\nreturned to the corn field and begun to bore a hole near where Mr.\r\nJones was standing.\r\n\r\n\"That's the thing,\" said he, \"the same kind of an auger them\r\nfellows had three years ago. Still boring holes, are you? Want to\r\nbore around over my farm again, do you?\"\r\n\r\nPercy replied that he would be glad to make borings in several\r\nplaces in order that he might see about what the soil and subsoil\r\nwere like in that kind of land.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Young Man. Just bore as many holes as you please.\r\nI suppose you'd rather do that than work; but you'll have to excuse\r\nme. I've got a lot to do today, and it's already getting late. I\r\ncan't take time again to tell you fellows how to raise tobacco. Good\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nANOTHER LESSON ON TOBACCO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE old man had stuck his cob pipe in a pocket and filled his mouth\r\nwith a chew of tobacco.\r\n\r\nHe walked by Percy's buggy with the tobacco juice drizzling from the\r\ncorners of his mouth, and turned down the road toward the house.\r\n\r\nPercy finished boring the hole and then returned to the buggy.\r\n\r\n\"Christ, that old man eats tobacco like a beast!\" exclaimed the\r\ndriver as Percy approached.\r\n\r\n\"Are you speaking to me?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not my name, please,\" admonished Percy, \"but I can tell\r\nyou that I know Him well and that He is my best friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, old Al Jones?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--Christ,\" replied Percy, with a grieved expression plainly\r\ndiscernible.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the driver.\r\n\r\nThey drove past the Jones residence and out into the field beyond.\r\nThe house one might have thought deserted except for the well-beaten\r\npaths and the presence of chickens in the yard. It was a large\r\nstructure with two and a half stories. The cornice and window\r\ntrimmings revealed the beauty and wealth of former days. Rare shrubs\r\nstill grew in the spacious front yard, and gnarled remnants of\r\norchard trees were to be seen in the rear. A dozen other buildings,\r\nlarge and small, occupied the background, some with the roofs partly\r\nfallen, others evidently still in use.\r\n\r\n\"How old do you suppose these buildings are?\" asked Percy of the\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n\"About a hundred years,\" he replied, \"and I reckon they've had no\r\npaint nor fixin' since they was built, 'cept they have to give some\r\nof 'em new shingles now and then or they'd all fall to pieces like\r\nthe old barns back yonder.\"\r\n\r\nPercy examined the soil in several places on the Jones farm and on\r\nother farms in the neighborhood. They lunched on crackers and canned\r\nbeans at a country store and made a more extended drive in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\"It is a fine soil,\" Percy said to the driver, as they started for\r\nLeonardtown. \"It contains enough sand for easy tillage and quick\r\ndrainage, and enough clay to hold anything that might be applied to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" said the driver. \"Where they put plenty of manure\r\nand fertilizer they raise tobacco three foot high and fifteen\r\nhundred pounds to the acre, but where they run the tobacco rows\r\nbeyond the manured land so's to be sure and not lose any manure, why\r\nthe stuff won't grow six inches high and it just turns yellow and\r\nseems to dry up, no matter if it rains every day. Say, Mister, would\r\nyou mind telling me if you're a preacher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" replied Percy, \"--I am not a preacher, any more than every\r\nChristian must be loyal to the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway, I've learned a lesson I'll try to remember. I never\r\nthought before about how it might hurt other people when I swear. I\r\ndon't mean nothing by it. It's just a habit; but your saying Christ\r\nis your friend makes me feel that I have no business talking about\r\nanybody's friend, any more than I'd like to hear anybody else use my\r\nmother's name as a by-word. I reckon nobody has any right to use\r\nChrist's name 'cept Christians or them as wants to be Christians. I\r\nreckon we'd never heard the name if it hadn't a been for the\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't have so many bad habits. I don't drink, nor smoke, nor\r\nchew; and I don't want to. My father smoked some and chewed a lot,\r\nand I know the smell of tobacco used to make my mother about as sick\r\nas she could be; but she had to stand it, or at least she did stand\r\nit till father died; and now she lives with me, and I'm mighty glad\r\nshe don't have to smell no more tobacco\r\n\r\n\"She often speaks of it--mother does; and she says she's so thankful\r\nshe's got a boy that don't use tobacco. She says men that use\r\ntobacco don't know how bad it is for other folks to smell 'em. Why,\r\nsometimes I come home when I've just been driving a man some place\r\nin the country, riding along like you and I are now, and he a\r\nsmoking or chewing, or at least his clothes soaked full of the vile\r\nodor; and when I get home mother says, 'My! but you must have had an\r\nold stink pot along with you to-day.' She can smell it on my\r\nclothes, and I just hang my coat out in the shed till the scent gets\r\noff from it.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir, I don't want any tobacco for me, and I don't know as I'd\r\ncare to raise the stuff for other folks to saturate themselves with\r\neither; and every kid is allowed to use it nowadays, or at least\r\nmost of them get it. It's easy enough to get it. Why, a kid can't\r\nkeep away from getting these cigarettes, if he tries. They're\r\neverywhere. Every kid has hip pockets full; and I know blamed well\r\nthat some smoke so many cigarettes they get so they aren't more than\r\nhalf bright. It's a fact, Sir,--plenty of 'em too; and some old men,\r\nlike Al Jones, are just so soaked in tobacco they seem about half\r\ndead. Course it ain't like whiskey, but I think it's worse than beer\r\nif beer didn't make one want whiskey later.\r\n\r\n\"But as I was saying, I feel that I have no business saying things\r\nabout,--about anybody you call your friend, and I think I'll just\r\nswear off swearing, if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can if you will just let Him be your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know much about that,\" was the slow reply. \"That\r\ntakes faith, and I don't have much faith in some of the church\r\nmembers I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That used to trouble me also,\" said Percy, \"until one time the\r\nthought impressed itself upon me that even Christ himself did all\r\nHis great work with one of the twelve a traitor; and this thought\r\nalways comes to me now when self-respecting men object to uniting\r\nwith organized Christianity because of those who may be regarded as\r\ntraitors or hypocrites, but not of such flagrant character as to\r\ninsure expulsion from the Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in miracles?\" asked the driver.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Percy, \"in such miracles as the growth of the corn\r\nplant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that isn't any miracle. Everybody understands all about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not everybody,\" replied Percy. \"There is only One who understands\r\nit. There is only one great miracle, and that is the miracle of\r\nlife. It is said that men adulterate coffee, even to the extent of\r\nmaking the bean or berry so nearly like the natural that it requires\r\nan expert to detect the fraud; but do you think an imitation seed\r\nwould grow?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it wouldn't grow,\" said the driver.\r\n\r\n\"Not only that,\" said Percy, \"but we may have a natural and perfect\r\ngrain of corn and it can never be made to grow by any or all of the\r\nknowledge and skill of men, if for a single instant the life\r\nprinciple has left the kernel, which may easily result by changing\r\nits temperature a few degrees above or below the usual range. The\r\nspark of life returns to God who gave it, and man is as helpless to\r\nrestore it as when he first walked the earth.\r\n\r\n\"What miracle do you find hard to accept?\" asked Percy.\r\n\r\n\"How could Jesus know that Lazarus had died when he was on the other\r\nside of the mountain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Percy replied; \"perhaps by some sort of wireless\r\nmessage which his soul could receive. I don't know how, but it was\r\nno greater miracle than it would have been then to have done what I\r\ndid last week.\"\r\n\r\nThe driver turned to look squarely at Percy as though in doubt of\r\nhis sanity, but a kindly smile reassured him.\r\n\r\n\"Our train coming into Cincinnati ran in two sections,\" Percy\r\ncontinued, \"and the section behind us was wrecked, three travellers\r\nbeing killed and about fifteen others wounded. I was sure my mother\r\nwould hear of the wreck before I could reach her with a letter, and\r\nso I talked with her from Cincinnati over the long distance 'phone,\r\nwith which we have always had connection since I first went away to\r\ncollege. Yes, I talked with her, and, though separated by a distance\r\nthree times the entire length of Palestine, I distinctly heard and\r\nrecognized my mother's voice. Oh, yes, I believe in miracles; but\r\nthat is a matter of small consequence. The important thing is that\r\nwe have faith in God and faith in Jesus Christ, his Son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what troubles me,\" said the driver. \"How's one to get\r\nfaith?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two methods of receiving faith,\" replied Percy. \"Faith\r\ncometh by prayer.\" \"Yes, Sir, I believe that.\" \"And, faith cometh by\r\nhearing.\" \"Hearing what?\" \"Hearing by the Word of God; hearing those\r\nwho have studied His Word and who testify of Him; and hearing with\r\nan ear ready to receive the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nEIGHTEEN TO ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO days later Percy was in Rhode Island visiting a farm owned by\r\nSamuel Robbins, one of the most progressive and successful farmers\r\nof that State.\r\n\r\nMr. Robbins' farm lay in what appeared to be an ancient valley,\r\nseveral miles in width, although only a small stream now winds\r\nthrough it to the sea seven miles away.\r\n\r\n\"So you are from Illinois,\" said Mr. Robbins, after Percy had\r\nintroduced himself and explained the nature of his visit. \"The\r\npapers have a good deal to say about the corn you grow in Illinois;\r\nbut have you noticed that the Government reports show our average\r\nyield of corn in New England is higher than yours in Illinois?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" Percy replied, \"I have noticed that and I have come to\r\nRhode Island to learn how to raise more corn per acre. I have\r\nnoticed, however, that New England corn does not occupy a large\r\nacreage.\"\r\n\r\nWell, now, we count corn as one of our big crops, next to hay.\r\nYou'll see plenty of corn fields right here in Rhode Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you believe that we actually raise more corn on one farm in\r\nIllinois than the total corn crop of Rhode Island?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't tell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Percy, \"the Isaac Funk farm in McLean County grows more\r\ncorn on seven thousand acres a year, with an average yield certainly\r\nabove fifty bushels per acre, and surely making a total above\r\n350,000 bushels; while the State of Rhode Island grows corn on\r\nnearly ten thousand acres with an average yield of thirty-two\r\nbushels, making a total yield of about 320,000 bushels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll give it up; but I'd like to know how much corn you raise\r\nin the whole State of Illinois.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our average production,\" said Percy, \"is about equal to the total\r\nproduction of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,\r\nAlabama, and Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen of us!\" exclaimed Mr. Robbins, who had counted on his\r\nfingers from New York to Mississippi. \"And you come to Rhode Island\r\nto learn how to raise corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I came to learn how you raise more than thirty-five bushels of\r\ncorn per acre as an average for New England, while we raise less\r\nthan thirty-five bushels as an average in Illinois, and while\r\nGeorgia, a larger State than Illinois, raises only eleven bushels\r\nper acre as a ten year average. Illinois is a new State, but I call\r\nto mind that Roger Williams settled in Rhode Island in 1636 and that\r\nhe was joined by many others coming not only from Massachusetts but\r\nalso from other sections. I assume that much of the land in Rhode\r\nIsland has been farmed for 250 years, and the fact that you are\r\nstill producing more than thirty bushels of corn per acre, as an\r\naverage, is, it seems to me, a fact of great significance. I suppose\r\nyou use all the manure you can make from the crops you raise and\r\nperhaps use some commercial fertilizer also. I should like to know\r\nwhat yield of corn you produce without any manure or fertilizer?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't produce any,\" said Mr. Robbins; \"at least we know we\r\nwouldn't produce any corn without fertilizing the land in one way or\r\nanother. If you will walk over here a little ways you can see for\r\nyourself. I didn't have quite enough manure to finish this field and\r\nI had no more time to haul seaweed so I planted without getting any\r\nmanure on a few rods in one corner, and the corn there wouldn't make\r\nthree bushels from an acre. I didn't bother to try to cut it, but\r\nthe cows will get what little fodder there is as soon as I can get\r\nthe shocks out of the field and turn 'em in for a few days to pick\r\nup what they can.\"\r\n\r\nPercy examined the corn plants still standing in the corner of the\r\nfield. They had grown to a height of about two feet. Most of them\r\nhad tassels and many of them appeared to have little ears, but\r\nreally had only husks containing no ear. In a few places where the\r\nhill contained only one plant a little nubbin of corn could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to let any of my land get as poor as this field was,\"\r\ncontinued Mr. Robbins, \"but I just couldn't get to it, and I left it\r\nin hay about two years longer than I should have done. Last year was\r\nfirst class for hay but this field had been down so long it was\r\nhardly worth cutting.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what yield do you get from the manured land?\" inquired Percy.\r\n\r\n\"In a fair year I get about forty bushels, and that's about what I\r\nam getting this year from my best fields. You see there's lots of\r\ncorn in these shocks. There's about an average ear, and we get five\r\nor six ears to the hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight-row flint,\" said Percy, as he took the ear in his hand and\r\ndrew a celluloid paper knife from his vest pocket with a six-inch\r\nscale marked on one side.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir, our regular Rhode Island White Cap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just five inches long. Weight about three ounces?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps. We count on about four hundred ears to the bushel. If we\r\nget four thousand hills to the acre one ear to the hill would give\r\nus ten bushels per acre, so you see we only have to have four ears\r\nto the hill to make our forty bushels. A good many hills have five\r\nto six ears, but then of course, some hills don't have much of any,\r\nso I suppose my corn makes an average of four ears about like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you feed all of the corn you raise in order to produce as\r\nmuch manure as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feed that corn! Not much we don't. Why, corn like that brings us\r\nclose on to a dollar a bushel. No, Sir, we don't feed this corn.\r\nIt's all used for meal. It makes the best kind of corn meal. No, we\r\nbuy corn for feed; western corn. Oh, we feed lots of corn; three\r\ntimes as much as we raise; but we don't feed dollar corn, when we\r\ncan buy western corn for seventy-five or eighty cents.\r\n\r\n\"I sell corn and I sell potatoes; that's all except the milk. I keep\r\nmost of my land in meadow and pasture and feed everything I raise\r\nexcept the corn and potatoes. And milk is a good product with us. We\r\naverage about sixty cents a pound for butter fat, and it's ready\r\nmoney every month; and, of course, we need it every month to pay for\r\nfeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you produce on the farm all the manure you use,\" suggested\r\nPercy, \"but I think you mentioned hauling seaweed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I haul some manure, too, when I can get it; but usually\r\nthere are three or four farmers ready to take every load of town\r\nmanure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You get it from town for the hauling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess not,\" said Mr. Robbins emphatically and with apparent\r\nastonishment at such a question. \"I don't think I would haul seaweed\r\nseven miles if I could get manure in town for nothing. Manure is\r\nworth $1.50 a ton Iying in the livery stable, and there are plenty\r\nto take it at that right along. I'd a little rather pay that than\r\nhaul seaweed; but the manure won't begin to go around, and so\r\nthere's nothing left for us but seaweed; and, if we couldn't get\r\nthat, the Lord only knows what we could do.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much seaweed can you haul to a load, and about how many loads\r\ndo you apply to the acre?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the roads are good we haul a cord and a quarter, and we put\r\nten or twelve loads to the acre for corn and then use some\r\ncommercial fertilizer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how much a cord of the seaweed would weigh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a cord weighs about a ton and a half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you apply about twenty tons of seaweed to the acre for corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but some use less and some more; probably that's about an\r\naverage. Hauling seaweed's a big job and a bad job. We have to start\r\nfrom home long before daylight so as to get there and get the weed\r\nwhile the tide is out, and then we get back with our load about two\r\no'clock in the afternoon; and, by the time we eat and feed the team,\r\nand get the load to the field and spread, there isn't much time left\r\nthat day, especially when you've got to pile out of bed about two\r\no'clock the next morning and hike off for another load.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you use some fertilizer in addition to the seaweed? May I ask\r\nhow much fertilizer you apply to the acre and about how much it\r\ncosts per ton?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where we spread seaweed for corn, we add about four hundred and\r\nfifty pounds per acre of fertilizer that costs me $26 a ton, but I\r\nhave the agency and get it some cheaper than most have to pay. Then\r\nfor potatoes we apply about 1500 pounds of a special potato\r\nfertilizer that costs me $34 a ton.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fertilizer costs you about $6 an acre for the corn crop and $25\r\nfor potatoes,\" said Percy; \"and then you have the cost of the\r\nseaweed. I should think you would need to count about $25 or $30 an\r\nacre for the expense of hauling seaweed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all of that if we had to pay for the work, but of course we\r\ncan haul seaweed more or less when the farm work isn't crowding, and\r\nwe don't count so much on the expense. It doesn't take the cash,\r\nexcept may be a little for a boy to drive one team when we haul two\r\nloads at a time; and we don't use seaweed for potatoes. The corn\r\ncrop will generally more'n pay for it and the fertilizer too; and\r\nthe seaweed helps for three or four years, especially for grass.\r\nThere's good profit in potatoes, too, when we get a crop, but\r\nthey're risky, considering the money we have to pay for fertilizer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nFARMER OR PROFESSOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER leaving Rhode Island, Percy spent two days in and about\r\nBoston, and then returned to Connecticut for a day. The weather had\r\nturned cold; the ground had frozen and the falling snow reminded him\r\nthat it was the day before Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nFrom New London he took a night boat to New York, and then took\r\npassage on a Coast Line vessel from New York to Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe weather had cleared and the wind decreased until it was scarcely\r\ngreater than the speed of the ship.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the dining room service was extraordinary because of\r\nthe day, Percy was soon convinced that the only way to travel was by\r\nboat. He regretted only that his mother was not with him to enjoy\r\nthat day. For hours they coasted southward within easy view of the\r\nNew Jersey shore, dotted here and there with cities, towns, and\r\nvillages. Light houses marked the rocky points where danger once\r\nlurked for the men of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe sea itself was of constant interest; and hundreds of craft were\r\npassed or met. Here a full-rigged sailing vessel lazily drifting\r\nwith the wind; there a giant little tug puffing in the opposite\r\ndirection with a string of barges in tow loaded almost to the\r\nwater's edge.\r\n\r\nNorfolk was reached early the next morning, and before noon Percy\r\npassed through Petersburg on his way to Montplain. He changed cars\r\nat Lynchburg and arrived at Montplain before dark. In accordance\r\nwith a promise to Mr. West he had notified him of his plans.\r\n\r\nWould Adelaide met him, and if so would she have the family carriage\r\nand again insist upon his riding in the rear seat? He had found\r\nthese questions in his mind repeatedly since he left New London,\r\nwith no very definite purpose before him except to arrive at\r\nMontplain at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nYes, it was the family carriage. He saw the farm team tied across\r\nthe street from the depot. As he left the train he caught a glimpse\r\nof Adelaide standing with the group of people who were waiting to\r\nboard the train. She extended her hand as he reached her side.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnston, meet my cousin, Professor Barstow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to meet you, Professor,\" said Percy, as he shook hands\r\nwith a tall young man about his own age. Percy noted his handsome\r\nface and gentlemanly bearing.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Adelaide calls me cousin,\" said Barstow, \"because my aunt\r\nmarried her uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir, if we're not cousins, then I'm Miss West and not Miss\r\nAdelaide. Is that too much for an absent-minded professor to\r\nremember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid it is,\" said Barstow, \"and I am sure I would rather be\r\ncousins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor Barstow leaves on this train,\" Adelaide explained to\r\nPercy; \"excuse me, please.\"\r\n\r\nPercy raised his hat as he stepped back from the crowd and waited\r\nfor the parting of the two. He was sure that Barstow held her hand\r\nlonger than was necessary, and he also noticed that her face flushed\r\nas she rejoined him after the train started.\r\n\r\n\"Will you take the rear seat?\" she asked. as they reached the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n\"If you so prefer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seat is for our guests, so I don't prefer,\" came her reply,\r\nwhich left Percy wholly in the dark as to her wishes.\r\n\r\n\"Then let me be your coachman rather than your guest.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you so prefer,\" she repeated, and without waiting for assistance\r\nquickly mounted to the front seat, leaving him to occupy the\r\ndriver's seat beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Captain and Mrs. Stone of Montplain were with us for Thanksgiving\r\nand I came with the carriage to take them home. Professor Barstow\r\nhas also been spending his Thanksgiving vacation visiting with\r\npapa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Percy, as he took the lines and turned the horses\r\ntoward Westover.\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly welcome to drive this team if you enjoy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for that also,\" said Percy. Adelaide noted the word\r\n_also, _but she only remarked that she hoped he had enjoyed his\r\ntravels, though she could not understand what pleasure he could find\r\nin visiting old worn-out farms.\r\n\r\n\"Of all things,\" she continued, \"it seems to me that farming is the\r\nlast that anyone would want to undertake.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is both the first and the last,\" said Percy. \"As you know, when\r\nour ancestors came to America, agriculture was the first great\r\nindustry they were able to develop. Other industries and professions\r\nfollow agriculture and must be supported in large measure by the\r\nagricultural industry. Merchants, lawyers, doctors and teachers are\r\nin a sense agricultural parasites.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour before he would not have included teachers in this class;\r\nfor, next to the mother in the home, he felt that the teacher in the\r\nschool is the greatest necessity for the highest development of the\r\nagricultural classes.\r\n\r\n\"Without agriculture,\" he continued, \"America could never have been\r\ndeveloped, and, unless the prosperity of American agriculture can be\r\nmaintained, poverty is the only future for this great nation. The\r\nsoil is the greatest source of wealth, and it is the most permanent\r\nform of wealth. The Secretary of Agriculture at Washington told me a\r\nfew days ago that eighty-six per cent. of the raw materials used in\r\nall our manufacturing industry are produced from the soil.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, agriculture is certainly the first industry in this country;\r\nand I am fully convinced that to restore the fertility of the\r\ndepleted soils of the East and South, and even to maintain the\r\nproductive power of the great agricultural regions of the West,\r\ndeserves and will require the best thought of the most influential\r\npeople of America.\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the length and breadth of this land, the almost\r\nuniversal purpose of the farmers is to work the land for all they\r\ncan get with practically no thought of permanency. The most common\r\nremark of the corn belt farmer is that his land doesn't show much\r\nwear yet; and it is holding up pretty well, or as well as could be\r\nexpected; or that he thinks it will last as long as he does. All\r\nrecognize that the land cannot hold up under the systems of farming\r\nthat are being practiced, and these systems are essentially the same\r\nas have been followed in America since 1607. What the Southern\r\nfarmer did with slave labor, the Western farmer is now doing with\r\nthe gang plow, the two-row cultivator, and the four-horse disks and\r\nharrows. In addition he tile-drains his land which helps to insure\r\nlarger crops and more rapid soil depletion. He even uses clover as a\r\nsoil stimulant, and spreads the farm fertilizer as thinly as\r\npossible with a machine made for the purpose in order to secure both\r\nits plant food value and its stimulating effect. Positive soil\r\nenrichment is practically unknown in the great corn belt.\r\n\r\n\"Robbery is a harsh word; and yet the farmers and landowners of\r\nAmerica are and always have been soil robbers; and they not only rob\r\nthe nation of the possibility of permanent prosperity, but they even\r\nrob themselves of the very comforts of life in their old age and\r\ntheir children and grandchildren of a rightful inheritance.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than all this, or at least more lamentable, is the fact that\r\nit need not be. The soils of Virginia need not have become worn out\r\nand abandoned; because the earth and the air are filled with the\r\nelements of plant food that are essential to the restoration and\r\npermanent maintenance of the high productive capacity of these\r\nsoils. Moreover there is more profit and greater prosperity for the\r\npresent landowner in a possible practicable system of positive soil\r\nimprovement than under any system which leads to ultimate depletion\r\nand abandonment of the land.\r\n\r\n\"The profit in farming lies first of all in securing large crop\r\nyields. It costs forty bushels of corn per acre in Illinois to raise\r\nthe crop and pay the rent for the land or interest and taxes on the\r\ninvestment. With land worth $150 an acre, it will require $8 to pay\r\nthe interest and taxes. Another $8 will be required to raise the\r\ncrop and harvest and market it, even with very inadequate provision\r\nmade for maintaining the productive power of the soil, such as a\r\ncatch crop of clover, or a very light dressing of farm fertilizer. A\r\nforty-bushel crop of corn at forty cents a bushel, which is about\r\nthe ten year average price for Illinois, would bring only $16 an\r\nacre, and this would leave no profit whatever.\r\n\r\n\"A crop of fifty bushels would leave only ten bushels as profit;\r\nbut, if we could double the yield and thus produce a hundred bushels\r\nper acre, the profit would not be doubled only, but it would be six\r\ntimes as great as from the fifty bushel crop. In other words, 100\r\nbushels of corn from one acre would yield practically the same\r\nprofit as fifty bushels per acre from six acres, simply because it\r\nrequires the first forty bushels from each acre to pay for the fixed\r\ncharges or regular expense.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the amount of crop the farmer handles, but the amount of\r\nactual profit that determines his prosperity. It requires profit to\r\nbuild the new home or repair the old one, to provide the home with\r\nthe comforts and conveniences that are now to be had in the country\r\nas well as in the city; to send the boys and girls to college; to\r\nprovide for the expense of travel and the luxuries of the home.\"\r\n\r\nPercy stopped himself with an apology.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will pardon me, Miss West. I forget that this subject\r\nmay be of no interest to you, and I have completely monopolized the\r\nconversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have told me so much,\" she replied. \"I am deeply\r\ninterested in what you have been saying. I never realized that\r\nagriculture could involve such very important questions in regard to\r\nour national prosperity. I only know that our farm has furnished us\r\nwith a living but there has been very little of what you call\r\nprofit. We children could never have gone away to school except that\r\nwe were enabled to take advantage of some unusual opportunities. My\r\nbrother almost earned his expenses as commissary in a boarding club\r\nat college. He felt that he could not come home for Thanksgiving\r\nbecause he had a chance to earn something and I have missed him so\r\nmuch. Most farmers get barely enough from their farms in these parts\r\nto furnish them a modest living and pay their taxes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me of your statement that farming is the last thing\r\nthat you would expect anyone to undertake. In a large sense that is\r\nin accordance with the history of all great agricultural countries.\r\nAfter the great wave of easy spoilation of the land has passed, and\r\nthe farmers reach a condition under which they need most of what\r\nthey produce for their own consumption, the parasites are themselves\r\nforced to produce their own food. The lands become divided into\r\nsmaller holdings and the agricultural inhabitants increase rapidly\r\nin proportion to the urban population which must depend upon the\r\nprofits from secondary pursuits for a living. Thus ninety-five per\r\ncent. of the three hundred million people of India belong\r\nprincipally to the agricultural classes, and the farms of India\r\naverage about two to three acres in size. Farming there is in no\r\nsense a profit-yielding business, but it is only a means of\r\nexistence. The people live upon what they raise, so far as they can,\r\nalthough, as you must know, India is almost never free from famine.\r\nIn Russia, the situation is but little better, for famine follows if\r\nthe yield of wheat falls two bushels below the average. Special\r\nagents of the Bureau of Statistics of the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture report that at least one famine year occurs in each\r\nfive year period, and sometimes even two; that the famine years are\r\nso frequent they are recognized as a permanent feature of Russian\r\nagriculture.\"\r\n\r\n\"But couldn't those poor starving people do some other kind of work\r\nand thus earn a better living?\" asked Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"No. Agriculture is the only hope,\" said Percy. \"The soil is the\r\nbreast of Mother Earth, from which her children must always draw\r\ntheir nourishment, or perish. It is the 'last thing,' as you truly\r\nsaid. Aside from hunting and fishing, there is no source of food\r\nexcept the soil, and, when this is insufficient for the people who\r\nproduce it in the country, God pity the poor people who live in the\r\ncities. But let us not talk of this more. I ought not to have taken\r\nup the time of our ride through this beautiful scenery with a\r\nsubject which tends always toward the serious. The leaves are all\r\ngone in New England, but here they have only taken on their most\r\nbeautiful colors. 'What is so rare as a day in June?' could now well\r\nbe answered, 'a day in November in Piedmont, Virginia.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know if your father received a letter for me from the\r\nchemist to whom I sent the soil samples?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it came in Wednesday's mail, and there is a letter from the\r\nUniversity of Illinois and two others that Grandma says must be from\r\na lady. Papa says he is anxious to know what results would be found\r\nin the chemist's report. May I listen while you tell papa about it?\r\nIndeed, I am extremely interested to know if anything can be done to\r\nmake our farm produce such crops as it used to when grandmother was\r\na little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still I fear you will find it a very tiresome subject,\" said Percy.\r\n\"It is, as a rule, not an easy matter to adopt a system of permanent\r\nimprovement on land that has been depleted by a century or more of\r\nexhaustive husbandry. but you will be very welcome not only to\r\nlisten but to counsel also. My mother can measure difficulties in\r\nadvance better than most men; and I believe it is true that women\r\nwill deliberately plan and follow a course involving greater\r\nhardship and privation than men would undertake. I cannot conceive\r\nof any man doing what my mother has done for me.\"\r\n\r\nAdelaide glanced at Percy as he spoke of his mother. Something in\r\nhis words or voice seemed to reveal to her a depth of feeling, a\r\nwealth of affection akin to reverence, such as she had never\r\nrecognized before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE ULTIMATE COMPARISON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILKES was at the side gate to meet Adelaide and Percy, and the\r\ngrandmother stood at the door as they reached the veranda.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for us you got back before the Thanksgiving scraps are all\r\ngone,\" she said to Percy, \"but I suppose even our Thanksgiving fare\r\nwill be poor picking after you've been living in Washington and\r\nBoston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even the Thanksgiving dinner on the boat was not equal to this,\"\r\nsaid Percy, as they sat down to the table loaded with such an\r\nabundance of good things as is rarely seen except on the farmer's\r\ntable. The \"scraps,\" if such there were, had no appearance of being\r\nleft-overs, and there was monster turkey, browned to perfection and\r\nsizzling hot, placed before Mr. West ready for the carving knife.\r\n\r\nPercy had opened the letter from the chemist, but said to Mr. West\r\nthat it would take him an hour or more to compute the results to the\r\nform of the actual elements and reduce them to pounds per acre in\r\norder to make possible a direct comparison between the requirements\r\nof crops, on the one hand, and the invoice of the soil and\r\napplication of plant food in manure and fertilizers, on the other\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"Please let me help you make the computations,\" said Adelaide, much\r\nto the surprise of her parents, who knew that she took no interest\r\nin affairs pertaining to farming. \"I like mathematics and will\r\npromise not to make any mistakes if you will tell me how to do some\r\nof the figuring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Percy. \"With your help it will take only half the\r\ntime that I should require alone.\"\r\n\r\nThis proved to be correct, for in half an hour after supper they had\r\nthe results in simplified form. Even the mother and grandmother\r\njoined the circle as Percy began to discuss the results with Mr.\r\nWest\r\n\r\n\"Now here is the invoice,\" said Percy, \"of the surface soil from an\r\nacre of land where we collected the first composite sample,--the\r\nland which you said had not been cropped since you could remember.\r\nThis soil contains plant food as follows:\r\n\r\n1,440 pounds of nitrogen\r\n380 pounds of phosphorus\r\n15,760 pounds of potassium\r\n3,340 pounds of magnesium\r\n10,420 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know how these amounts compare with what your Illinois\r\nsoil contains,\" said Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"We have several different kinds of soil in Illinois,\" replied\r\nPercy. \"The common corn belt prairie soil is called brown silt loam.\r\nIt contains, as an average, 5000 pounds of nitrogen and 1200 pounds\r\nof phosphorus, or nearly four times as much of each of those\r\nelements as this Virginia soil which you say is too poor to\r\ncultivate.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote to the Illinois Experiment Station before I left Washington\r\nto see if I could get the average composition of the heavier prairie\r\nsoil, which occupies the very flat areas that were originally\r\nswampy, and one of the letters you had received for me gives 8000\r\npounds of nitrogen and 2000 pounds of phosphorus as the general\r\naverage for that soil. That is our most productive land, and it\r\ncontains about five times as much of these two very important\r\nelements as your poorest land.\r\n\r\n\"Our more common Illinois prairie contains about 35,000 pounds of\r\npotassium, 9,000 pounds of magnesium, and I 1,000 pounds of calcium.\r\nThis is more than twice as much potassium and nearly three times as\r\nmuch magnesium as in your poorest land, but the calcium content is\r\nabout the same in your soil as in ours. However, as you will\r\nremember, your soil is distinctly acid and consequently markedly in\r\nneed of lime, the magnesium and calcium evidently being contained in\r\npart in the form of acid silicates with no carbonates; whereas, our\r\nbrown silt loam is a neutral soil and our black clay loam contains\r\nmuch calcium carbonate, the same compound as pure limestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious to know about our best land,\" said Mr. West. \"What\r\ndid the chemist find in the soil from the slope where we get the\r\nbest corn after breaking up the old pastures?\"\r\n\r\n\"He found the following amounts in the surface soil,\" said Percy.\r\n\r\n800 pounds of nitrogen\r\n\r\n1,660 pounds of phosphorus\r\n\r\n34, 100 pounds of potassium\r\n\r\n8,500 pounds of magnesium\r\n\r\n13,100 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\n\"Rich in everything but nitrogen,\" Percy continued, \"richer than our\r\ncommon prairies in phosphorus and calcium, and nearly as rich in\r\npotassium and magnesium; but very, very poor in nitrogen. Legume\r\nplants ought to grow well on that land, because the minerals are\r\npresent in abundance, and, while lack of nitrogen in the soil will\r\nlimit the yield of all grains and grasses, there is no nitrogen\r\nlimit for the legume plants if infected with the proper\r\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria, provided, of course, that the soil is not\r\nacid. You will remember, however, that even this sloping land is\r\nmore or less acid, although here and there we found pieces of\r\nundecomposed limestone. With a liberal use of ground limestone, any\r\nlegumes suited to this soil and climate ought to grow luxuriantly on\r\nthose slopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me that we are greatly troubled with Japan clover on\r\nthose slopes,\" said Mr. West. \"Of course it makes good pasture for a\r\nfew months, but it doesn't come so early in the spring as blue grass\r\nand it is killed with the first heavy frost in the fall. We like\r\nblue grass much better for that reason, but when we seed down for\r\nmeadow and pasture, the Japan clover always crowds out the timothy\r\nand blue grass on those slopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you plow under the Japan clover, you get one or two good\r\ncrops of grain,\" said Percy, \"because this clover has stored up some\r\nmuch needed nitrogen and the soil is rich in all other necessary\r\nelements. Have you ever tried alfalfa on that kind of land? That is\r\na crop that ought to do well there, especially if limestone were\r\napplied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have tried alfalfa,\" replied Mr. West, \"and I tried it on a\r\nstrip that ran across one of those steep slopes; but it failed\r\ncompletely, and, as I remember it, it was poorer on that hillside\r\nthan on the more level land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you inoculate it?\" Percy asked.\r\n\r\n\"Inoculate it? No. I didn't do anything to it, but just sow it the\r\nsame as I sow red clover.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean to inoculate it?\" asked Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"It means to put some bugs on it,\" said the grandmother; \"some germs\r\nor microbes, or whatever they are called. Don't you remember,\r\nAdelaide, that I told you about that when I read it in the magazine\r\na while ago? Don't you remember that somebody was making it and a\r\nman could carry enough in his vest pocket to fertilize an acre and\r\nhe wanted $2 a package. Charles said that $1.50 a hundred was more\r\nthan he could afford to pay for fertilizer, and he didn't care to\r\npay $2 for a vest pocket package. Isn't that the stuff, Mr.\r\nJohnston?\"\r\n\r\n\"It listens like it, as the Swedes say,\" said Percy, \"but the\r\nadvertisements of these germ cultures put out by commercial\r\ninterests are usually very misleading. The safest and best and least\r\nexpensive method of inoculating a field for alfalfa is to use\r\ninfested soil taken from some old alfalfa field or from a patch of\r\nground where the common sweet clover, or mellilotus, has been\r\ngrowing for several years. I saw the sweet clover growing along the\r\nrailroad near Montplain, and there is one patch on the roadside\r\nright where--when you enter the valley on the way to the station.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right where Adelaide smashed that nigger's eye with her heel and\r\nhelped Mr. Johnston capture them both,\" broke in the grandmother.\r\n\"That's the only good thing I can say for her peg heeled shoes.\"\r\n\r\nAdelaide colored and Percy now understood what had been a puzzle to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"The same bacteria,\" he went on quickly, \"live upon both the sweet\r\nclover and the alfalfa, or at least they are interchangeable. These\r\nbacteria are not a fertilizer in any ordinary sense, but they are\r\nmore in the nature of a disease, a kind of tuberculosis, as it were;\r\nexcept that they do much more good than harm. They attack the very\r\ntender young roots of the alfalfa and feed upon the nutritious sap,\r\ntaking from it the phosphorus and other minerals and also the sugar\r\nor other carbohydrates needed for their own nourishment, since they\r\nhave no power to secure carbon and oxygen from the air, as is done\r\nby all plants with green leaves. On the other hand, these bacteria\r\nhave power to take the free nitrogen of the air, which enters the\r\npores of the soil to some extent, and cause it to combine with food\r\nmaterials which are secured from the alfalfa sap, and thus the\r\nbacteria secure for themselves both nitrogen and the other essential\r\nplant foods. The alfalfa root or rootlet becomes enlarged at the\r\npoint attacked by the bacteria, and a sort of wart or tubercle is\r\nformed which resembles a tiny potato, as large as clover seed on\r\nclover or alfalfa, and, singularly, about as large as peas on\r\ncowpeas or soy beans. On plants that are sparsely infected, these\r\ntubercles develop to a large size and often in clusters. While the\r\nbacteria themselves are extremely small and can be seen only by the\r\naid of a powerful microscope, the tubercles in which they live are\r\neasily seen, and they are sufficient to enable us to know whether\r\nthe plants are infected.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would tell me the difference between the words\r\ninoculated and infected,\" said Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"Inoculated is used in the active sense and infected in the\r\npassive,\" said Percy. \"Thus the red clover growing in the field is\r\ninfected if there are tubercles on its roots, although it may never\r\nhave been inoculated; and we inoculate alfalfa because it would not\r\nbe likely to become infected without direct inoculation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Under favorable conditions,\" continued Percy, \"these bacteria\r\nmultiply with tremendous rapidity, somewhat as the germs of small\r\npox or yellow fever multiply if allowed to do so. A single tubercle\r\nmay contain a million germs which if distributed uniformly over an\r\nacre would furnish more than twenty bacteria for every square foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Charles,\" said the grandmother, \"wouldn't a vest pocketful\r\nof those bugs or germs be a big enough dose for one acre?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but they're not a fertilizer, Mother,\" said Mr. West, \"and\r\nbesides Mr. Johnston says it is better to use the infected sweet\r\nclover soil and there is no need of paying $2 an acre for something\r\nwe knew nothing about, and especially on land that is not worth more\r\nthan $2 an acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care what it's worth,\" she replied, \"some of it cost your\r\ngrandfather $68 an acre, and it will never be sold for any $2, while\r\nI have any say so about it.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited for Percy to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"The individual bacteria are very short-lived,\" he continued, \"and\r\nproducts of decay soon begin to accumulate in the tubercles. These\r\nproducts contain, in combined form, nitrogen which the bacteria have\r\ntaken from the air, and in this form it is taken from the tubercles\r\nand absorbed through the roots into the host plant and thus serves\r\nas a source of nitrogen for all of the agricultural legumes.\r\n\r\n\"It should be kept in mind, of course, that the red clover has one\r\nkind of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, that the cowpea has a different\r\nkind, and that the soy bean bacteria are still different, while a\r\nfourth kind lives on the roots of alfalfa and sweet clover.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much infected sweet clover soil would I need to inoculate an\r\nacre of land for alfalfa?\" asked Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"If the soil is thoroughly infected, a hundred pounds to the acre\r\nwill do very well if applied at the same time the alfalfa seed is\r\nsown and immediately harrowed in with the seed. If allowed to lie\r\nfor several hours or days exposed to the sunshine after being spread\r\nover the land the bacteria will be destroyed, for like most\r\nbacteria, such as those which lurk in milk pails to sour the milk,\r\nthey are killed by the sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\" That's right,\" said the grandmother. \"That's the way to sterilize\r\nmilk pails and pans and crocks. I like crocks better than pans. They\r\ndon't have any sort of joints to dig out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" continued Percy, \"a wagon load of infected soil will\r\nmake a more perfect inoculation than a hundred pounds, and where it\r\ncosts nothing but the hauling it is well to use a liberal amount.\"\r\n\r\n\"How deep should it be taken?\" asked Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"About the same depth as you would plow. The tubercles are mostly\r\nwithin six or eight inches of the surface. The bacteria depend upon\r\nthe nitrogen of the air and this must enter the surface soil.\r\nSometimes in wet weather the tubercles can be found almost at the\r\nsurface of the ground, and when the ground cracks one can often find\r\ntubercles sticking out in the cracks an inch or two beneath the\r\nsurface but protected from direct sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"These bacteria have power to furnish very large amounts of nitrogen\r\nto such a crop as alfalfa. The Illinois Station reports having grown\r\neight and one-half tons of alfalfa per acre in one season. It was\r\nharvested in four cuttings. The hay itself was worth at least $6 a\r\nton above all expenses, which would bring $51 an acre net profit for\r\none year. Of course this was above the average, which is only about\r\nfour and one-half tons over a series of several years. But suppose\r\nyou can save only three tons and get $6 a ton net for it, as you\r\ncould easily do by feeding it to your cattle and sheep. That would\r\nbring $18 an acre or six per cent. interest on $300 land. I am\r\naltogether confident that this could be done on your sloping\r\nhillsides, with their rich supplies of phosphorus and other mineral\r\nfoods, provided, of course, that you use plenty of ground limestone\r\nand thoroughly inoculate the soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I shall certainly try alfalfa again,\" said Mr. West, \"and if\r\nI can grow such crops of alfalfa as you think on the hillsides, I\r\ncan have much more farm manure produced for the improvement of the\r\nrest of the land. By the way what did that chemist find in that\r\nsample you took of the other land where it does not wash so much as\r\non the steeper slopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He found the following:\r\n\r\n1,030 pounds of nitrogen\r\n1,270 pounds of phosphorus\r\n16,500 pounds of potassium\r\n7,460 pounds of magnesium\r\n16,100 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\n\"Well, the phosphorus is not so low,\" said Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"Fully equal to that in our $150 Illinois prairie,\" replied Percy,\r\n\"and again the calcium is more than ours, with magnesium not far\r\nbelow, and potassium half our supply. Nitrogen is plainly the most\r\nserious problem on most of this farm, and limestone and legumes must\r\nsolve that problem if properly used.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think this land could be made as valuable as the Illinois\r\nland just by a liberal use of limestone and legumes?\" asked\r\nAdelaide.\r\n\r\n\"I should have some doubt about that,\" Percy replied. \"Your very\r\nlevel uplands that neither lose nor receive material from surface\r\nwashing are very deficient in phosphorus and much poorer than ours\r\nin potassium and magnesium; and your undulating and steeply sloping\r\nlands are more or less broken, with many rock outcrops on the points\r\nand some impassable gullies, which as a rule compel the cultivation\r\nof the land in small irregular fields. A three-cornered field of\r\nfrom two to fifteen acres can never have quite the same value per\r\nacre as the land where forty or eighty acres of corn can be grown in\r\na body with no necessity of omitting a single hill. Then there is\r\nsome unavoidable loss from surface washing, so that to maintain the\r\nsupply of organic matter and nitrogen will require a larger use of\r\nlegumes than on level land of equal richness. In addition to this is\r\nthe initial difference in humus content. This is well measured by\r\nthe nitrogen content. While your soil contains eight hundred pounds\r\nof nitrogen on the steeper slopes and one thousand pounds on the\r\nmore gently undulating areas, ours contains five thousand pounds in\r\nthe brown silt loam and eight thousand pounds in the heavier black\r\nclay loam. This means that our Illinois prairie soil contains from\r\nfive to ten times as much humus, or organic matter, as your best\r\nupland soil. To supply this difference in humus would require the\r\naddition of from four hundred to eight hundred tons per acre of\r\naverage farm manure, or the plowing under of one hundred to two\r\nhundred tons of air-dry clover. This represents the great reserve of\r\nthe Illinois prairie soils above the total supplies remaining in\r\nyour soils.\r\n\r\n\"Our farmers are still producing crops very largely by drawing on\r\nthis reserve. Of course most of this great supply of humus is very\r\nold. It represents the organic residues most resistant to\r\ndecomposition; and, where corn and oats are grown exclusively, the\r\nsoil has reached a condition on many farms under which the\r\ndecomposition of the reserve organic matter is so slow that the\r\nnitrogen liberated from its own decay and the minerals liberated\r\nfrom the soil by the action of the decomposition products are not\r\nsufficient to meet the requirements of large crops, and for this\r\nreason alone some of our lands that are still rich are said to be\r\nrun down; but they only require a moderate use of clover or farm\r\nmanure or other fresh and active organic matter to at once restore\r\ntheir productiveness to a point almost equal to the yields from the\r\nvirgin soil. Some Illinois farmers who have discovered this apparent\r\nrestoration have jumped to the conclusion that they have solved the\r\nproblem of permanently maintaining the fertility of the soil; and I\r\njudge from a remark made by the Secretary of Agriculture that some\r\nIowa farmers have the same mistaken notions.\r\n\r\n\"These fresh supplies of active organic matter serve primarily as\r\nsoil stimulants, hastening the liberation of nitrogen from the\r\norganic reserve and of minerals from the inorganic soil materials.\r\n\r\n\"Where one of the Eastern farmers has managed a farm under the\r\nrotation system with the occasional use of clover or light\r\napplications of farm manure,--where this has been continued until\r\nthe great reserve is largely gone, and the phosphorus supply greatly\r\ndepleted, then the land is truly run down, but not until then.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, land-plaster and quick-lime, still more powerful soil\r\nstimulants, are often brought into the system to bring about a more\r\ncomplete exhaustion of the soil reserves, and lastly the use of\r\nsmall amounts of high-priced commercial fertilizers serves to put\r\nthe land in suitable condition for ultimate abandonment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that commercial fertilizers injure the soil?\" asked Mr.\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to some extent they injure the soil because they tend to\r\ndestroy the limestone and increase the acidity of the soil, and also\r\nbecause they contain more or less manufactured land-plaster and thus\r\nserve as soil stimulants; but the chief point to keep in mind\r\nconcerning the use of the common so-called complete commercial\r\nfertilizer is that they are too expensive to permit their use in\r\nsufficient quantities to positively enrich the soil. Thus the farmer\r\nmay apply two hundred pounds of such a fertilizer at a cost of $3.00\r\nan acre, and then harvest a crop of wheat, two crops of hay, pasture\r\nfor another year or two, plow up the grounds for corn, apply another\r\ntwo hundred pounds for the corn crop, follow with a crop of oats,\r\nand then repeat. He thus harvests five crops and pastures a year or\r\ntwo and applies perhaps four hundred pounds of fertilizer at a cost\r\nof $6.00.\r\n\r\n\"As an average of the most common commercial fertilizers sold to the\r\nfarmers in the Eastern and Southern States, the four hundred pounds\r\nwould add to the soil seven pounds of nitrogen, fourteen pounds of\r\nphosphorus and seven pounds of potassium, while a single\r\nfifty-bushel crop of corn will remove from the soil ten times as\r\nmuch nitrogen, five times as much potassium, and nearly as much\r\nphosphorus as the total amounts applied in this six-year or\r\nseven-year rotation.\r\n\r\n\"In this manner the farmer extends the time during which he can take\r\nfrom the soil crops whose value exceed their cost. He applies only\r\none-fourth or possibly one-half as much of the most deficient\r\nelement as the crops harvested require, and thus he continues for a\r\nlonger time to 'work the land for all that's in it! '\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, isn't that the limit?\" said Adelaide, with emphasis on the\r\n\"isn't,\" for which she received a disapproving look from her mother,\r\nso far as her almost angel-face could give such a look.\r\n\r\n\"So far as human ingenuity has yet devised,\" replied Percy, \"this\r\nsystem appears to be the limit; but this limit has not yet been\r\nreached on any Westover soil. If anyone can devise a method for\r\nextending this limit he should apply it on a type of soil covering\r\nmore than two-fifths of the total area of St. Mary County and more\r\nthan 45,000 acres of Prince George County, Maryland, some of which\r\nalmost adjoins the District of Columbia. This soil has been reduced\r\nin fertility until it contains only one-third as much phosphorus as\r\nyour poorest land. I found a Western man who had come down to\r\nMaryland a few years ago. He saw that beautiful almost level upland\r\nsoil, and it looked so good to him that he bought and kept buying\r\nuntil he had 'squared out' a tract of eleven hundred acres. He\r\nstill had left money enough to fence the farm and to put the\r\nbuildings in good repair. He was a live-stock farmer from the West\r\nwho just knew from his own experience and from that of the Secretary\r\nof Agriculture, in the use of a little clover or farm manure in\r\nunlocking the great reserves of an almost virgin soil, that all his\r\nMaryland farm needed was clover seed and live stock. Sheep\r\nespecially he knew to be great producers of fertility.\r\n\r\n\"He sowed the clover and grass seed and they germinated well. He\r\neven secured a fine catch, but it failed to hold, as we say out\r\nWest. He tried again and again, and failed as often as he tried. He\r\nshowed me his best clover on a field that had received some manure\r\nmade from feed part of which was purchased, and that had also\r\nreceived five hundred pounds per acre of hydrated lime, which he was\r\nfinally persuaded to use, after becoming convinced that\r\nclover-growing on old abandoned land was not exactly as easy as\r\nclover-growing on a 'run-down' farm of almost virgin soil in the\r\nWest.\"\r\n\r\n\"And was the clover good after that treatment?\" asked Mr. West.\r\n\r\n\"No, not good,\" said Percy, \"but in some places where the manure had\r\nbeen applied to the high points, as is the custom of the Western\r\nfarmer, the yield of clover, weeds, and foul grass together must\r\nhave been nearly a half ton to the acre. Fortunately he waited to\r\nfully stock his farm with cattle and sheep until he should have some\r\nassurance of producing sufficient feed to keep them for a time at\r\nleast, instead of making the common mistake of the less experienced\r\nfarmer who goes to the country from the city, and who imagines that,\r\nif he has plenty of stock on the farm, they must of necessity\r\nproduce abundance of manure with which to enrich his land for the\r\nproduction of abundant crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now you'll have to show me,\" said the grandmother. \"To my\r\nway of thinking that's a pretty good kind of a notion for a farmer\r\nto have, and I'd like to know what's wrong with it.\"\r\n\r\nAgain a shadow seemed to cross the sweet face as the mother's glance\r\nturned from grandma to Adelaide.\r\n\r\n\"The system has some merit,\" replied Percy, \"but it starts at the\r\nwrong point in the circle. Cattle and sheep must first have feed\r\nbefore they can produce the fertilizer with which to enrich the\r\nsoil; and people who would raise stock on poor land should always\r\nproduce a good supply of food before they procure the stock\r\nrequiring to be fed. There is probably no more direct route to\r\nfinancial disaster than for one to insist upon over-stocking a farm\r\nthat is essentially worn out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But doesn't pasturing enrich the soil?\" asked the grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"Pasturing may enrich the soil only in a single element of plant\r\nfood,\" said Percy. \"In all other elements simple pasturing must\r\nalways contribute toward soil depletion. If the pasture herbage\r\ncontains a sufficient proportion of legume plants so that the\r\nfixation of free nitrogen exceeds the utilization of nitrogen in\r\nanimal growth, then the soil will be enriched in that element,\r\nalthough with the same growth of plants it would be enriched more\r\nrapidly without pasturing; for animals are not made out of nothing.\r\nMeat, milk, and wool are all highly nitrogenous products.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand no amount of pasturing can add to the soil a\r\nsingle pound of any one of the six mineral elements, and phosphorus,\r\nwhich is normally the most limited of all these elements, is\r\nabstracted from the soil and retained by the animals in very\r\nconsiderable amounts. As an average one-fourth of the phosphorus\r\ncontained in the food consumed is retained in the animal products,\r\nespecially in bone, flesh, and milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I didn't know that milk contained phosphorus,\" said Mr. West,\r\n\"although I did know, of course, that phosphorus must be contained\r\nin bone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, as you know,\" said Percy, \"milk is the only food of young\r\nanimals, and they must secure their bone food from the milk.\r\nFurthermore, the complete analysis of milk shows that it contains\r\nvery considerable quantities. There are also records of digestion\r\nexperiments in which less than one-half of the phosphorus in the\r\nfood consumed was recovered in the total manural excrements. As a\r\nmatter of fact there is a time in the life of the young mother, as\r\nwith the two-year old cow, for example, when she must abstract from\r\nthe food she consumes sufficient phosphorus for the nourishment of\r\nthree growing animals,--her own immature body, a suckling calf, and\r\nanother calf as yet unborn.\r\n\r\n\"Of course the organic matter of the soil should increase under\r\npasturing, especially under conditions that make possible an\r\naccumulation of nitrogen; but here too the animals make no\r\ncontribution toward any such accumulation. With the same growth of\r\nplants the accumulation of organic matter would be much more rapid\r\nwithout live stock.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is known absolutely but not generally that live stock destroy\r\nabout two-thirds of the organic matter contained in the food they\r\nconsume. With grains the proportion is higher, and with coarse\r\nforage it is lower, but as an average about two-thirds of the dry\r\nmatter in tender young grass or clover or in a mixed, well-balanced\r\nration of grain and hay is digested and thus practically destroyed\r\nso far as the production of organic matter is concerned.\r\n\r\n\"This you could easily verify yourself, Mr. West, by feeding two\r\nthousand pounds of any suitable ration, such as corn and clover hay,\r\ncollecting and drying the total excrement, which will be found to\r\nweigh about seven hundred pounds, if it contains no higher\r\npercentage of moisture than was contained in the two thousand pounds\r\nof food consumed.\r\n\r\n\"Of course one should not forget that the liquid excrement contains\r\nmore nitrogen and more potassium than the solid, and that much of\r\nthis can be saved and returned to the land by use of plenty of\r\nabsorbent bedding, and in pasturing there is no danger of any loss\r\nfrom this source.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is one great trouble with us,\" said Mr. West. \"We never have\r\nas much bedding as we could use to advantage, and it is altogether\r\ntoo expensive to permit us to think of buying straw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably it would be much less expensive for you to buy ground\r\nlimestone and then use good alfalfa hay for bedding,\" said Percy. \"I\r\nmean exactly what I say,\" he continued. \"Of course I do not advise\r\nyou to use good alfalfa hay in that way, but it would be a cheap\r\nsource of very valuable bedding, and it would make an extremely\r\nvaluable manure. However, I should not hesitate to make liberal use\r\nof partially spoiled alfalfa hay for bedding, and you are quite\r\nlikely to have more or less such hay; for under favorable\r\nconditions, such as you can easily have with your soil and climate,\r\nalfalfa comes on with a rush in the spring, and often the first crop\r\nshould be cut before the weather is suitable for making hay. There\r\nshould be very little or no delay at this time, because the first\r\ncutting should be removed in order that it may be out of the way of\r\nthe second crop, which comes forward still more rapidly under normal\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\"Some of our Illinois farmers make strenuous objection to taking\r\ncare of an alfalfa field that produces $50 worth of the richest and\r\nmost valuable hay, because it interferes too much with the proper\r\ncare of a $25 corn crop, which they somehow feel requires and\r\ndeserves all their time and attention.\r\n\r\n\"Some of our Virginia farmers have sent to Illinois for their seed\r\ncorn,\" said Mr. West; \"and they report very good results as a rule,\r\nespecially on land that has been kept up. On our poor land I think\r\nthe native corn does better than the Western seed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is because it is used to it,\" suggested Percy, \"used\r\nto making the struggle for itself on poor land. Fighting for all it\r\ngets, so to speak. You know the high-bred animals cannot hold their\r\nown with the scrubs when it comes to pawing the snow off the dead\r\nwild grass for a living in the winter, as cattle must do sometimes\r\non the plains of the Northwest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there may be something in that,\" responded Mr. West, \"but the\r\nwestern seed corn certainly looks fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is true,\" said Percy. \"Our farmers have made marked\r\nimprovement in seed corn; they also understand very well how to grow\r\ncorn. They know how and when to prepare the ground, how and when to\r\nplant; and how and when to cultivate. When Illinois farmers go to\r\nIowa to buy land, the Iowa real estate men usually take them to see\r\na farm that is owned and operated by a former Illinoisan, and they\r\ninsist that there are no other farmers who know how to raise corn\r\nquite so well as the Illinois farmer. Perhaps the Illinois real\r\nestate man would tell a similar story to the Iowa farmer if he ever\r\ncame there to buy land, but 'Westward the Course of Empire takes its\r\nWay' and the man once gone west knows the east no more, except as a\r\nmarket for his surplus products or a good place in which to spend\r\nhis surplus cash.\r\n\r\n\"But, here. We must finish our study of the data that Miss Adelaide\r\nso kindly helped me to compute.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that he had spoken her name in her presence;\r\nand she met his glance as she raised her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat's in a name? What's in a glance?\r\n\r\nPercy proceeded without delay; and Adelaide listened as before, her\r\ndrooping lashes protecting her eyes almost entirely from the view of\r\nothers. The father and mother heard no name spoken and saw no eyes\r\nmeet, and yet as Percy continued speaking a second self seemed to be\r\nthinking different thoughts and he was conscious of a strong desire\r\nto look longer than an instant into those captivating eyes.\r\n\r\nA side glance, as she let her lashes droop, revealed to Adelaide\r\nthat grandma alone had heard and seen. But Percy was a very\r\ncommon-place man. Certainly he had no such face as had held her\r\nglance for more than an instant as the afternoon train began to move\r\nfrom the depot platform. Percy was slightly above the average height\r\nand solidly built, but he was not tall. His face had often been\r\ndescribed as a \"perfect blank.\" No one saw anything of what lay\r\nwithin by merely looking into his eyes, and yet there was a certain\r\nindescribable something that appealed to one from those eyes. An\r\nelderly German lady once remarked to his mother: \"Ihr Sohn hat so\r\netwas gutes im Auge.\"\r\n\r\nPercy was not polished in manner, Adelaide admitted. Professor\r\nBarstow had said that he deliberated for half an hour as to whether\r\nhe should bring his \"cawds,\" for use on Thanksgiving day, because he\r\nfeared that the custom in \"Vi'ginia\" might not be the same as in\r\n\"No'th Cahlina\"; while she doubted very much if Percy had any cards\r\nwhatever. She had never heard it said that he was \"strong as an ox\r\nand quick as lightning,\" but perhaps she knew it as well as his\r\nschoolmates ever had. She had not heard that one of the college\r\nprofessors, noted for his short-cut expressions, had once told his\r\nclass that he wished they would all \"keep their thinking apparatus\r\nin as good repair as Johnston's.\" One thing she did know was that\r\nPercy's voice had been trained to talk to a woman, and that no other\r\nvoice had ever spoken her name as he did. Reserve force? depth of\r\nmanhood? confidence in his own words? absolute decision? wealth of\r\ntenderness? persistent endurance? unfailing loyalty? boundless\r\naffection? Deep in her heart Adelaide felt that these were among the\r\nattributes revealed in Percy's voice. When he spoke all listened.\r\nHis voice was low-pitched but rich in tone and volume and\r\nsincerity,--that was the word.--The whole man seemed to feel and\r\nspeak when he spoke. He surely can have no secrets. His mother must\r\nknow all that he knows of his own self; but were those letters from\r\nhis mother? The handwriting was very modern. Even her father made an\r\nold-fashioned C and W in signing his own name. Had he not looked at\r\nthe writing on both those letters before he noticed the others? and\r\nwhy did he remain so long in his room before coming down to dinner?\r\nHad he not been in college--in a great University where there were\r\nhundreds of the brightest girls of his own State? But why should any\r\ngirl be interested in farming? Teaching is such a cultured\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nOnly a moment--just while he was sorting the papers upon which they\r\nhad made the computations, but a hundred thoughts had passed through\r\nher mind. Now he was speaking.\r\n\r\n\"You remember we took a sample of the subsoil on the sloping land.\r\nThis soil is evidently residual, formed in place from the\r\ndisintegration of the underlying rock. The soil may represent only a\r\nsmall part of the original rock, because of the loss by leaching.\r\nHere are the amounts of plant food found in two million pounds of\r\nthe subsoil:\r\n\r\n590 pounds of nitrogen\r\n1,980 pounds of phosphorus\r\n37,940 pounds of potassium\r\n24,808 pounds of magnesium\r\n31,320 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\n\"A splendid subsoil,\" Percy continued. \"I know of none better in\r\nIllinois, except that we sometimes have more calcium in the form of\r\ncarbonate, and even somewhat more potassium in places; but this must\r\nbe a fine subsoil for alfalfa, where the bed rock is not too near\r\nthe surface. Of course there is but little nitrogen in the subsoil,\r\nbut that is true of all normal soils, because the nitrogen is\r\ncontained only in the organic matter, and that decreases rapidly\r\nwith depth and usually becomes insufficient to color the soil below\r\n18 inches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" began Mr. West, \"from these different analyses or invoices,\r\nand from your discussion of these results, I take it that you would\r\nnot advise me to purchase any commercial fertilizer for use on the\r\nland we are still using in my rotation; but you think we should make\r\nlarge use of limestone and legume crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir. Phosphorus is markedly deficient only in the very level\r\nupland which has been allowed to remain uncleared for fifty years or\r\nmore, and nitrogen is certainly the limiting element on the land you\r\nare trying to keep in your rotation. While you cannot hope to put\r\ninto your soil any such reserve of slow-acting organic matter as we\r\nstill have in our comparatively new soils of the West, we may keep\r\nin mind that a small amount of quick-acting fresh organic matter is\r\nmore effective than a large supply of what we might call embalmed\r\nmaterial that decomposes very, very slowly unless assisted by the\r\naddition of more active organic matter. It frequently happens that\r\none soil containing a large reserve of old humus, and hence showing\r\nmore organic carbon and more nitrogen, by the ultimate invoice, than\r\nanother soil, is, nevertheless, less productive, because the other\r\nsoil contains a larger amount of fresh organic matter which decays\r\nquickly and thus furnishes more nitrogen and liberates more of the\r\nother elements from the insoluble minerals of the soil because of\r\nthe greater abundance of the active products of organic decay.\r\n\r\n\"I think you should keep in mind, however, that, for every\r\ntwenty-five bushels of corn you wish to produce, you should return\r\nto the soil one ton of clover or four tons of average farm manure,\r\nand that for one ton of produce hauled to the barns and fed, you\r\nwill probably not return to the land more than one ton of manure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\"STONE SOUP\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next forenoon Percy and Mr. West spent some time making some\r\nfurther tests with hydrochloric acid and litmus paper in different\r\nplaces on the farm; but the result only confirmed the previous\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\"I never before saw any such light as now appears,\" said Mr. West.\r\n\"It seems to me that for the first time in the history of Westover,\r\ncovering about two centuries, a real plan can be intelligently made\r\nbased upon definite information looking toward the positive\r\nimprovement of the soil. While you have been away, I have been\r\nlooking up the lime matter. I find that a lime is being advertised,\r\nand sold in small amounts, that is called hydrated lime, and it is\r\nespecially prepared as an agricultural lime. It is recommended by\r\nsome dealers as being fully equal to the ordinary commercial\r\nfertilizer which sells at about $25 a ton, while this hydrated\r\nagricultural lime can be bought for $8 a ton, and I think for a\r\nlittle less in larger amounts. You mentioned also that you had seen\r\nsome one who had used hydrated lime, but it didn't seem to make much\r\nof a clover crop. Of course, I understand from what you said that\r\nhis soil contained only one hundred and sixty pounds of phosphorus,\r\nand I take it that lime alone could not markedly improve his soil;\r\nbut still I would like to know why, if he has one hundred and sixty\r\npounds of phosphorus in his plowed soil, he could not produce a few\r\ngood crops of clover. HOW much phosphorus does it require for a ton\r\nof clover?\"\r\n\r\n\"One ton of clover contains only five pounds of phosphorus,\" Percy\r\nreplied, \"and of course the roots must also require some phosphorus,\r\nalthough after the crop is produced and removed, the phosphorus\r\ncontained in the roots remains for the benefit of subsequent crops.\r\nThus we might suppose the land which contains one hundred and sixty\r\npounds of phosphorus ought to furnish the phosphorus needed for a\r\nthree ton crop of clover every year for ten years; but in actual\r\npractice no such results are secured. The invoice of the plant food\r\nin the soil is a matter of very great importance, for it reveals the\r\nmathematical possibilities, but another matter of almost equal\r\nimportance is the problem of liberating plant food from this supply\r\nsufficient for the crops to be produced year by year.\r\n\r\n\"Decaying or active organic matter is one of the great factors in\r\nthe liberation of plant food, and undoubtedly the extension or\r\ndistribution of the root system of the growing plant is another very\r\npotent factor. If the root surfaces come in contact with one per\r\ncent. of the total surface of the soil particles in the plowed soil,\r\nthen we might conceive of a relationship whereby one per cent. of\r\nthe phosphorus in that soil would be dissolved or liberated from the\r\ninsoluble minerals and thus become available as food for the growing\r\ncrop. We know that the rate of liberation varies greatly, with\r\ndifferent soils and seasons, and crops also differ in their power to\r\nassist themselves in the extraction of mineral plant food from the\r\nsoil. The presence of limestone encourages the development of\r\ncertain soil organisms which tend to hasten some decomposition\r\nprocess. But, all things considered, it may be said, speaking very\r\ngenerally, that the equivalent of about one per cent. of the total\r\nphosphorus contained in the plowed soil does become available for\r\nthe crops under average conditions. On this basis one hundred and\r\nsixty pounds of phosphorus would furnish about one and one-half\r\npounds for the crops during one season. But in such a soil the\r\nphosphorus still remaining may be the most difficultly soluble, and\r\nthe supply of decaying organic matter may be extremely low, so that\r\npossibly less than one pound per acre would become available, and\r\nthis would meet the needs of less than four hundred pounds per acre\r\nof clover hay. Furthermore, the supply grows less and less with\r\nevery crop removed.\r\n\r\n\"With your ordinary soil, carrying twelve hundred and seventy pounds\r\nof phosphorus, perhaps you may be able by a liberal use of decaying\r\norganic matter to liberate ten or fifteen pounds of phosphorus, or\r\nsufficient for a crop of forty to sixty bushels of corn; and, with a\r\nsubsoil richer in phosphorus than the surface, and with more or less\r\nof the partially depleted surface removed by erosion year by year,\r\nthe supply of phosphorus is thus permanently provided for unless the\r\nbed rock is brought too near the surface. It is doubtful if the\r\ndirect addition of phosphorus to your sloping lands will ever be\r\nnecessary or profitable. Certainly such addition is not advisable\r\nuntil you have brought the land to as high a state of fertility as\r\nis practicable by means of limestone, legumes, and manure.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems clearly to be the case with most of the land now under\r\ncultivation on this farm,\" said Mr. West \"Can you tell me anything\r\nabout this hydrated lime?\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you it is correctly named,\" Percy replied. \"_Hydrated_\r\nmeans _watered,_ and an investment in hydrated lime is properly\r\nclassed with other watered investments. If you prefer to use\r\nhydrated lime I would suggest that you buy fresh burned lump lime\r\nand do the hydrating yourself, which only requires that you add\r\neighteen pounds of water to each fifty-six pounds of quick lime; in\r\nother words, that you slack the lime by adding water in the proper\r\nproportion. Both quick lime and hydrated lime are known as caustic\r\nlime. Webster says that the word _caustic_ means 'capable of\r\ndestroying the texture of anything or eating away its substance by\r\nchemical action.'\r\n\r\n\"This definition is correct for caustic lime, as you can easily\r\ndetermine by keeping your hand in a bucket of slacked lime a few\r\nminutes. Caustic lime eats away the organic matter of the soil. In\r\nan experiment conducted by the Pennsylvania Experiment Station,\r\nduring a period of sixteen years, eight tons of hydrated lime\r\ndestroyed organic matter equivalent to thirty-seven tons of farm\r\nmanure, as compared with the use of equivalent applications of\r\nground limestone; and, as an average of the sixteen years, every ton\r\nof caustic lime applied liberated seven dollars' worth of organic\r\nnitrogen, as compared with ground limestone. That this much\r\nliberated nitrogen was essentially wasted and lost is evidenced by\r\nthe fact that larger crops were produced where ground limestone was\r\nused than where burned lime was applied.\r\n\r\n\"The limestone must be quarried whether used for grinding or for\r\nburning, and the grinding can be done for twenty-five cents a ton\r\nwhere a large equipment with powerful machinery is used and where\r\ncheap fuel is provided, as near the coal mining districts. It need\r\nnot be very finely ground. If ground to pass a sieve with twelve\r\nmeshes to the linear inch, it is very satisfactory, provided that\r\nall of the fine dust produced in the grinding is included in the\r\nproduct. You see the soil acids are slightly soluble and they attack\r\nthe limestone particles and are thus themselves destroyed or\r\nneutralized. If, however, you ever wish to use raw rock phosphate,\r\ninsist upon its being sufficiently fine-ground that at least ninety\r\nper cent. of it will pass through a sieve with ten thousand meshes\r\nto the square inch, this being no finer than is required for the\r\nbasic slag phosphate, of which several million tons are now being\r\nused each year in the European countries. Like the raw rock\r\nphosphate, the slag gives the best results only when used in\r\nconnection with plenty of decaying organic matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me,\" said Mr. West, \"of what one of the fertilizer\r\nagents said about raw phosphate. He said the use of raw phosphate\r\nwith farm manure reminded him of 'stone soup,' which was made by\r\nputting a clean round stone in the kettle with some water. Pepper\r\nand salt were added, then some potatoes and other vegetables, a\r\npiece of butter and a few scraps of meat. 'Stone soup,' thus made,\r\nwas a very satisfactory soup. He said that in practically all of the\r\ntests of raw phosphate conducted by the various State Experiment\r\nStations, manure has been used as a means of supplying organic\r\nmatter to liberate the phosphorus from the raw rock, but in such\r\nlarge quantity as to be entirely impracticable for the average\r\nfarmer to use on his own fields; and his opinion was that the entire\r\nbenefit was due to the manure. He had a little booklet entitled\r\n'Available or Unavailable Plant Food--Which?' published by the\r\nNational Fertilizer Association, and said I could get a copy by\r\naddressing the Secretary at Nashville, Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately,\" said Percy, \"this is not a question of opinion but\r\none of fact; and it has been discovered that the fertilizer agents\r\nwho are long on opinions and short on facts prefer to sell four tons\r\nof complete fertilizer for $80, or even two tons of acid phosphate\r\nfor $30, rather than to sell one ton of raw phosphate, containing\r\nthe same amount of phosphorus, for $7.50. In the manufacture of\r\nacidulated fertilizers, one ton of raw phosphate, containing about\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds of the element phosphorus, is mixed\r\nwith one ton of sulfuric acid to make two tons of acid phosphate;\r\nand, as a rule, these two tons of acid phosphate are mixed with two\r\ntons of filler to make four tons of complete fertilizer. A favorite\r\nfiller is dried peat, which is taken from some of the peat bogs, as\r\nat Manito, Illinois, and shipped in train loads to the fertilizer\r\nfactories. The peat is not considered worth hauling onto the land in\r\nIllinois, even where the farmers can get it for nothing; but it\r\ncontains some organic nitrogen, and, by the addition of a little\r\npotassium salt, the agent is enabled to call the product a\r\n'complete' fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\"Experiments with the use of raw rock phosphate have been conducted\r\nby the State Agricultural Experiment Stations over periods of twelve\r\nyears in Maryland, eleven years in Rhode Island, twenty-one years\r\n(in two series) in Massachusetts, fourteen years (in two series) in\r\nMaine, twelve years in Pennsylvania, thirteen years in Ohio, four\r\nyears in Indiana, and from four to six years on a dozen different\r\nexperiment fields in different parts of Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"I have here some quotations taken from the directors of several of\r\nthese experiment stations which fairly represent the opinions which\r\nthey have expressed concerning their own investigations. Thus the\r\nMaryland director says:\r\n\r\n\"'The results obtained with the insoluble phosphates has cost\r\nusually less than one-half as much as that with the soluble\r\nphosphates. Insoluble South Carolina phosphate rock produced a\r\nhigher total average yield than dissolved South Carolina rock.'\r\n\r\n\"The Rhode Island director comments as follows:\r\n\r\n\"' With the pea, oat, summer squash, crimson clover, Japanese\r\nmillet, golden millet, white podded Adzuka bean, soy bean, and\r\npotato, raw phosphate gave very good results; but with the flat\r\nturnip, table beet, and cabbage it was relatively very inefficient.'\r\n\r\n\"The following statement is from the Massachusetts director:\r\n\r\n\"'It is possible to produce profitable crops of most kinds by\r\nliberal use of natural phosphates, and in a long series of years\r\nthere might be a considerable money saving in depending at least in\r\npart upon these rather than upon the higher priced dissolved\r\nphosphates.'\r\n\r\n\"The director of the Maine State Experiment Station gives us the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"'For the first year the largest increase of crop was produced by\r\nsoluble phosphate. For the second and third years without further\r\naddition of fertilizers, better results were obtained from the plots\r\nwhere stable manure and insoluble phosphates had been used.'\r\n\r\n\"The stable manure and insoluble phosphates here referred to were\r\nnot applied together, but on separate plots. In deed, the raw\r\nphosphate was not used in connection with manure either in Maryland,\r\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, or Indiana; and in\r\nthe extensive experiments in progress in Illinois the raw phosphate\r\nhas been used, as a rule, not with farm manure, but with green\r\nmanures; and wherever manure has been used in connection with the\r\nraw phosphate, as in Ohio, the comparison is made with the same\r\namounts of manure applied without phosphate.\r\n\r\n\"The Pennsylvania Report for 1895, page 210, contains the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"'The yearly average for the twelve years gives us a gain per acre\r\nof $2.83 from insoluble ground bone, $2.45 from insoluble South\r\nCaroline rock, $1.61 from reverted phosphate, and 48 cents from\r\nsoluble phosphate, thus giving us considerably better results from\r\nthe two forms of insoluble phosphate than from the reverted or\r\nsoluble forms.'\r\n\r\n\"The Indiana director reports as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'It will be seen that during the first and second years the rock\r\nphosphate produced little effect, while the acid phosphate very\r\nmaterially increased the yields. During the third and fourth\r\nseasons, however, the rock produced very striking results, even\r\nforging ahead of the acid. This and very similar investigations in\r\nprogress lead us to believe that rock phosphate is a cheap and\r\neffective source of phosphorus where immediate returns are not\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\"In the Ohio experiments eight tons of manure per acre were applied\r\nonce every three years in a three-year rotation of corn, wheat, and\r\nclover, three different fields being used, so that every crop might\r\nbe grown every year. The average yields for the thirteen years where\r\nmanure alone was used were:\r\n\r\n53.1 bushels of corn\r\n20.6 bushels of wheat\r\n1.63 tons of hay\r\n\r\n\"The average yields on the unfertilized land were:\r\n\r\n32.2 bushels of corn\r\n11.4 bushels of wheat\r\n1.16 tons of hay\r\n\r\n\"If the corn is worth 35 cents a bushel, the wheat 70 cents, and the\r\nhay $6 a ton, in addition to the expense of harvesting and\r\nmarketing, then the total value of the manure spread on the land is\r\n$2.07 a ton.\r\n\r\n\"Where $1.20 worth of raw phosphate (320 pounds) were added in\r\nconnection with the manure the average yields were as follows:\r\n\r\n61.4 bushels of corn\r\n26.3 bushels of wheat\r\n2.23 tons of hay\r\n\r\n\"And where $2.40 worth of acid phosphate (320 pounds) were used with\r\nthe same amount and kind of manure the following average yields were\r\nsecured:\r\n\r\n60.4 bushels of corn\r\n26.5 bushels of wheat\r\n2.16 tons of hay\r\n\r\n\"These are the actual yield, and by any method of computation yet\r\nproposed, each dollar invested in raw phosphate has paid back much\r\nmore than has a dollar invested in acid phosphate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And was the use of the raw phosphate really profitable?\" asked Mr.\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you might figure that out for yourself,\" Percy replied,\r\n\"preferably using the average prices for your own locality for corn,\r\nwheat and clover. As I figure it at prices below the ten-year\r\naverage for Illinois, the raw phosphate paid about eight hundred per\r\ncent. net on the investment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight hundred per cent! You must mean eight per cent. net.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir, I mean eight hundred per cent. net, but you had better\r\ntake the data and make your own computations. But does it not seem\r\nstrange that, with such positive knowledge as this available, many\r\nof the Illinois landowners who have managed to sell off enough of\r\ntheir original stock of fertility in grain or stock at good prices\r\nto enable them to more than pay for their lands, should continue to\r\ninvest their surplus in more land with hope that it will pay them\r\neight per cent. interest, when they could secure many times that\r\nmuch interest from investing in the permanent improvement of the\r\nland they already own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is not so strange,\" replied Mr. West. \"I fear that some\r\nof their ancestors did the same thing in Virginia and other Eastern\r\nStates until the land became poor, and then of course they were\r\n'land poor.' But, say, that 'stone soup' wouldn't be so bad for\r\nthose Ohio landowners, would it? I should think they would avail\r\nthemselves of the positive information from their experiment\r\nstation. Speaking of soup, I wonder if it isn't time for lunch! But\r\ntell me; are the Illinois farmers doing anything with raw\r\nphosphate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are doing something, but by no means as much as they\r\nought. About two months ago a group of the leading farmers from our\r\nsection of the State went up to Urbana to look over the experiment\r\nfields, some of which have been carried on since 1870. The land is\r\nthe typical corn belt prairie, and consequently the results should\r\nbe of very wide application. Well, as a result of that day's\r\ninspection of the actual field results, an even twelve carloads of\r\nraw phosphate were ordered by those farmers upon their return home;\r\nand I learned of another community where ten carloads were ordered\r\nat once after a similar visit. As an average of the last three years\r\nthe yield of corn on those old fields has been 23 bushels per acre\r\nwhere corn has been grown every year without fertilizing, 58 bushels\r\nwhere a three-year rotation of corn, oats and clover is followed,\r\nand in the same rotation where organic matter, limestone, and\r\nphosphorus have been applied the average yield has been 87 bushels\r\nin grain farming and 92 bushels in live-stock farming.\r\n\r\n\"I attended the State Farmers' Institute last February, and there I\r\nmet many men who have had several years' experience with the raw\r\nrock. Usually they put on one ton per acre as an initial application\r\nand plow it under with a good growth of clover; and, afterward,\r\nabout one thousand pounds per acre every four years will be ample to\r\ngradually increase the absolute total supply of phosphorus in the\r\nsoil, even though large crops are removed.\r\n\r\n\"A good many of our thinking farmers are now using one or two cars\r\nof raw phosphate every year, and they are figuring hard to keep up\r\nthe organic matter and nitrogen. The most encouraging thing is the\r\nvery marked benefit of the phosphate to the clover crop, and of\r\ncourse more clover means more corn in grain farming, and more corn\r\nand clover means more manure in live-stock farming.\r\n\r\n\"On the Illinois fields advantage is taken of these relations in the\r\ndeveloping of systems of permanent agriculture. You see, if the\r\nphosphate produces more clover, then more clover can be plowed under\r\non that land; or, if the crops are fed, then more manure can be\r\nreturned to the phosphated land than to the land not treated with\r\nphosphate and not producing so large crops. Really the phosphate is\r\nnot given full credit for what it has accomplished in the Ohio\r\nexperiments; because, while the land receiving phosphated manure has\r\nproduced about one-fourth larger crops than the land receiving the\r\nuntreated manure, the actual amounts of manure applied have been the\r\nsame, whereas one-fourth more manure can be produced from the\r\nphosphated land and if this increased supply of manure were returned\r\nto the land it would increase the supply of nitrogen and thus make\r\nstill larger crop yields possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is surely the way it would work out in practical farming,\"\r\nsaid Mr. West. \"I think I did not tell that $4.80 a ton is the\r\nlowest quotation I have been able to get as yet for ground limestone\r\ndelivered at Blue Mound Station.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would make its use prohibitive,\" said Percy. \"You ought to get\r\nit for just one-fourth of that, or for $1.20 a ton. In Illinois we\r\ncan get it delivered a hundred miles from the quarry for $1.20 a\r\nton. It costs no more for a thirty-ton car of ground limestone than\r\nthe farmer receives for a cow; and the cost of a car of fine-ground\r\nnatural phosphate is about equal to the price of one horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, our limestone supplies are essentially inexhaustible,\"\r\nsaid Mr. West, \"but is that also true of our natural phosphate\r\ndeposits?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not true of the high-grade phosphate,\" replied Percy; \"for,\r\naccording to the information furnished by the United States\r\nGeological Survey, it is evident that the known supplies of our\r\nhigh-grade phosphate will be practically exhausted in fifty years if\r\nour exportation continues to increase at the prevailing rate. After\r\nthat is gone we may then draw upon our low-grade phosphate deposits,\r\nwhich though probably not inexhaustible are known to be exceedingly\r\nextensive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHEORIES VERSUS FACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERCY planned to walk to Blue Mound to take the three-thirty train\r\nthat Saturday afternoon; but Adelaide's parents both insisted that\r\nshe would willingly drive to the station, and the grandmother\r\ndiscovered that she needed a certain kind of thread which Adelaide\r\ncould then also get at the store.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Adelaide, with some merriment, \"I always enjoy our\r\ndeparting guests to the train.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Percy. \"If you must go to get the thread and\r\nwill permit me to be the coachman, I shall be satisfied, for you\r\nwill be home early.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will take the colts and buckboard, and I shall be home in\r\nless than twenty minutes after your train leaves the station.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have missed several days of your beautiful 'Indian\r\nSummer,' because of my trip to the North,\" Percy remarked to Mr.\r\nWest as they sat on the broad veranda waiting for the hour of two\r\nthirty when the colts were to be ready for the drive.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you might have been with us while Professor Barstow was\r\nhere,\" replied Mr. West, \"not only because of the mild autumn\r\nweather we have had, but also because Professor Barstow has some\r\nideas about questions of soil fertility that are very different from\r\nthose you hold. He says a young man from Washington gave a lecture\r\nat his college down in North Carolina, in which he informed them\r\nthat the cause of infertility of soils is a poisonous substance\r\nexcreted by the plant itself, and that this can be overcome by\r\nchanging from one crop to another because the excrete of one plant,\r\nwhile poisonous to that plant, will not be poisonous to other plants\r\nof a different kind. Thus, by rotation of crops, good crops could be\r\ngrown indefinitely on the same land without the addition of plant\r\nfood. He said that the soil water alone dissolved plenty of plant\r\nfood from all soils for the production of good crops, and that the\r\nsupply of plant food will be permanently maintained, because the\r\nplant food contained in the subsoil far below where the roots go is\r\nbeing brought to the surface by the rise of the capillary moisture,\r\nand that there is in fact a steady tendency toward an accumulation\r\nof plant food in the surface soil. He said that it is never\r\nnecessary to apply fertilizing material to any soil for the purpose\r\nof increasing the supply of plant food in that soil. He admitted\r\nthat applications of fertilizers sometimes produce increased crop\r\nyields, but that the effect was due to the power of the fertilizer\r\nto destroy the toxic substances excreted by the plants, and this is\r\nreally the principal effect of potash, phosphates, and nitrates, and\r\nalso of farm manure and green manures. Humus, he said, is one of the\r\nvery best substances for destroying these toxic excrete although\r\nthey had some other things which were as good or better than any\r\nsore of fertilizing materials. He mentioned especially a substance\r\ncalled pyrogallol, which cost $2.00 a pound, and of course it could\r\nnot be applied on a large scale; but it was as good a fertilizer as\r\nanything, although it contains nothing but carbon, oxygen, and\r\nhydrogen, which, as you explained to me when you were here before,\r\nthe plants secure in abundance from air and water. This information\r\nhad been secured in the laboratories at Washington by growing wheat\r\nseedlings in water culture for twenty-day periods.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already heard something of those theories,\" said Percy, \"but\r\nI shall be glad to have you tell me more about them. As I understand\r\nthem, we need only to rotate and cultivate and our lands should\r\nalways continue to produce bountiful crops. Is that correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that is the theory,\" replied Mr. West, \"but I know it\r\nis not correct for my grandfather used to grow two or three times as\r\nmuch wheat per acre as I can grow, and I rotate much more than he\r\ndid. In fact I can grow only ten to fifteen bushels of wheat per\r\nacre once in ten years, whereas he grew from twenty-five to forty\r\nbushels per acre in a five-year rotation; and I don't see that there\r\nis any particular connection between the growing of wheat seedlings\r\nin small pots or bottles for a few twenty-day periods and the\r\ngrowing of crops in soils during successive seasons. No, I don't\r\ntake any stock in their theories. I think they are _watered, _or\r\nperhaps I should say _hydrated, _in deference to science. But I\r\nwould like to know about this question of plant food coming up from\r\nbelow. That would be a happy solution of the fertilizer problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Percy, \"that soluble salts are brought to the\r\nsurface in the rise of moisture by capillarity in times of partial\r\ndrouth; and in the arid regions where the small amount of water that\r\nfalls in rain or snow leaves the soil only by evaporation, because\r\nthere is never enough to produce underdrainage, the salts tend to\r\naccumulate at the surface. The alkali conditions in the arid or\r\nsemiarid regions of the West are thus produced. But in humid\r\nsections where more or less of the rainfall leaves the soil as\r\nunderdrainage the regular loss by leaching is so much in excess of\r\nthe rise by capillarity that soils which are not affected by erosion\r\nor overflow steadily decrease in fertility even under natural\r\nconditions, with no cultivation and no removal of crops. Of course\r\nthis applies at first only to the mineral plant foods, as phosphorus\r\npotassium, magnesium, and calcium. While mineral supplies are\r\nabundant in the surface soil, there may be a large acumulation of\r\norganic matter and nitrogen, especially because of the growth of\r\nwild legumes, which are very numerous and in places very abundant,\r\nespecially on some of the virgin prairies of the West. However, as\r\nthe process of leaching proceeds there comes a time when the growth\r\nof the native vegetation is limited because of a deficiency in some\r\nessential mineral plant food, such as phosphorus, or the limestone\r\ncompletely disappears and soil acidity develops which greatly\r\nlessens the growth of the legumes.\r\n\r\n\"Decomposition of organic matter begins almost as soon as any part\r\nof the plant ceases to live, and there is certain to come a time\r\nwhen the rate of decomposition and loss exceeds the rate of fixation\r\nand accumulation; and from that time on the organic matter and\r\nnitrogen as well as the mineral plant foods continue to decrease in\r\nthe surface, until finally the natural barrens are developed, such\r\nas are found in different sections of the World and in some places\r\neven where the rainfall is sufficient for abundant crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir,\" said Mr. West. \"I know that is true. I have visited\r\nTennessee and I know there are some extensive areas there of\r\npractically level upland which have always been considered too poor\r\nto justify putting under cultivation, and they are called the\r\n'Barrens'.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know about those barren lands, too,\" said Percy. \"Our teacher of\r\nsoil fertility in college told us that a farm is more than a piece\r\nof the earth's surface. He said if we only wanted to get a large\r\nlevel tract of upland where the climate is mild and the rainfall\r\nabundant and where all sorts of crops do well on good soil,\r\nincluding the wonderful cotton crop which brings a hundred dollars\r\nfor a thousand pounds, while corn brings forty dollars for a hundred\r\nbushels,--well, he said we could go to the Highland Rim of Tennessee\r\nwhere, according to analyses reported in 1897 by the Tennessee\r\nExperiment Station, the surface soil of the 'Barrens' contains\r\neighty-seven pounds of phosphorus and the subsoil sixty-one pounds\r\nof phosphorus per acre, counting two million pounds of soil in each\r\ncase. He said, if we didn't like that we might go into the Great\r\nCentral Basin of Tennessee or the famous Blue Grass Region of\r\nKentucky and find land that is still extremely productive and more\r\nvaluable than ever, even after a hundred years of cultivation, and\r\nbuy land containing from three thousand to fifteen thousand pounds\r\nof phosphorus per acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know both of those sections very well,\" said Mr. West. \"But\r\ndoesn't it seem strange that the scientists at Washington would\r\nteach as they do? Why doesn't the plant food accumulate in the\r\nsurface soil of those barrens? Surely they have been lying there\r\nlong enough, with no crops whatever removed, so that they ought to\r\nhave become very rich. I wish I had known about their phosphorus\r\ncontent so I could have told Professor Barstow. He was quite carried\r\naway with the Washington theory.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought not for a moment call it the 'Washington' theory,\" said\r\nPercy; \"and neither is it promulgated by scientists, but rather by\r\ntwo or three theorists who are upheld by our greatest living\r\noptimist. Science, Sir, is a word to be spoken of always with the\r\ngreatest respect. Of course you know its meaning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know it comes from the Latin _scire, _to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then _science _means _knowledge; _it does not mean theory or\r\nhypothesis, but absolute and positive knowledge. Is there any\r\nuncertainty as to the instant when the next eclipse will appear? No,\r\nnone whatever. Science means knowledge, and men are scientists only\r\nso far as they have absolute knowledge, and to that extent every\r\nfarmer is a scientist.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless the erroneous teaching so widely promulgated by the\r\nfederal Bureau of Soils is undoubtedly a most potent influence\r\nagainst the adoption of systems of positive soil improvement in the\r\nUnited States, because it is disseminated from the position of\r\nhighest authority. Other peoples have ruined other lands, but in no\r\nother country has the powerful factor of government influence ever\r\nbeen used to encourage the farmers to ruin their lands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nGUESSING AND GASSING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAS we were riding to Montplain yesterday,\" said Adelaide to Percy,\r\nsoon after they started for Blue Mound, \"Professor Barstow told me\r\nthat in his opinion all that was needed to redeem these old lands of\r\nVirginia and the Carolinas is plenty of efficient labor, such as he\r\nthinks we had before the war. I know papa does not agree with him in\r\nthat, but Professor said that soils do not wear out if well\r\ncultivated, that in New England they grow as large crops as ever,\r\nand that in Europe, on the oldest lands the crop yields are very\r\nmuch larger than in the United States; and in fact that the European\r\ncountries are producing about twice as large crops as they did a\r\nhundred years ago. He thinks it is because they do their work more\r\nthoroughly than we do. He says that 'a little farm well tilled' is\r\nthe key to the solution of our difficulties.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might seem to be a good guess as to the probable relation of\r\ncause and effect,\" replied Percy, \"but we ought not to overlook some\r\nwell known facts that have an important bearing. It is exactly a\r\nhundred years since DeSaussure of France, first gave to the world a\r\nclear and correct and almost complete statement concerning the\r\nrequirements of plants for plant food and the natural sources of\r\nsupply. Sir Humphrey Davy, Baron von Liebig, Lawes and Gilbert, and\r\nHellriegel followed DeSaussure and completely filled the nineteenth\r\ncentury with accumulated scientific facts relating to soils and\r\nplant growth.\r\n\r\n\"Sir John Bennett Lawes, the founder of the Rothamsted Experiment\r\nStation, the oldest in the world, on his own private estate at\r\nHarpenden, England, began his investigations in the interest of\r\npractical agricultural science soon after coming into possession of\r\nRothamsted in 1834. In 1843 he associated with him in the work\r\nDoctor Joseph Henry Gilbert, and for fifty-seven years those two\r\ngreat men labored together gathering agricultural facts. Sir John\r\ndied in 1900, and Sir Henry the following year.\r\n\r\n\"That the people of Europe have made some use of the science thus\r\nevolved is evident from the simple fact that they are taking out of\r\nthe United States every year about a million tons of our best\r\nphosphate rock for which they pay us at the point of shipment about\r\nfive millions dollars; whereas, if this same phosphate were applied\r\nto our own soils that already suffer for want of phosphorus, it\r\nwould make possible the production of nearly a billion dollars'\r\nworth of corn above what these soils can ever produce without the\r\naddition of phosphorus. And our phosphate is only a part of the\r\nphosphate imported into Europe. They also produce rock phosphate\r\nfrom European mines, and great quantities of slag phosphate from\r\ntheir phosphatic iron ores.\r\n\r\n\"They feed their own crops and large amounts of imported food\r\nstuffs, and utilize all fertilizing materials thus provided for the\r\nimprovement of their own lands. Legume crops are grown in great\r\nabundance and are often plowed under to help the land.\r\n\r\n\"Do you wonder why the wheat yield in England is more than thirty\r\nbushels per acre while that of the United States is less than\r\nfourteen bushels? Because England produces only fifty million\r\nbushels of wheat, while she imports two hundred million bushels of\r\nwheat, one hundred million bushels of corn, nearly a billion pounds\r\nof oil cake, and other food stuffs, from which large quantities of\r\nmanure are made; and, in addition to this, England imports and uses\r\nmuch phosphate and other commercial plant food materials.\r\n\r\n\"Germany imports great quantities of wheat, corn, oil cake, and\r\nphosphates, and thus enriches her cultivated soil, and Germany's\r\nprincipal export is two billion pounds of sugar, which contains no\r\nplant food of value, but only carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, secured\r\nfrom air and water by the sugar beet.\r\n\r\n\"Denmark produces four million bushels of wheat, imports five\r\nmillion bushels of wheat, fifteen million bushels of corn, fifteen\r\nmillion bushels of barley, eight hundred million pounds of oil cake,\r\neight hundred million pounds of mill feed, and other food stuffs,\r\nphosphate, etc., and exports one hundred and seventy-five million\r\npounds of butter, which contains no plant food of value, but sells\r\nfor much more than these imports cost.\r\n\r\n\"Italy applies to her soils every year about a million tons of\r\nphosphates, which contain nearly twice as much phosphorus as is\r\nremoved from the land in all the crops harvested and sold from the\r\nfarms of Italy.\r\n\r\n\"The very good yields of the crops of New England are attributable\r\nto large use of fertilizing materials, in part made from food stuffs\r\nshipped in from the West; and the high development of certain lands\r\nof Europe and New England has been possible under the system\r\nfollowed only because the areas concerned are small. Thus, the\r\naverage acreage of corn in Rhode Island and Connecticut is less than\r\nthree townships, or less than one-tenth as much corn land in the two\r\nStates as the area of single counties in the Illinois corn belt.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of the 'Egypt' we have out West, Miss West?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out West, Miss West,\" she repeated. \"That is too much repetition\r\nof the same word to make a good sentence. I like 'Miss Adelaide'\r\nbetter; I do get tired of hearing West and Westover over and over.\r\nYes, I have heard of the 'Egypt' you have out West. Is it near\r\nIllinois?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near Illinois? Why, Miss Adelaide, I am surprised that you should\r\neven know about the crop yields of Rhode Island and not know where\r\n'Egypt' is. Let me inform you that 'Egypt' is in Illinois, and our\r\n'Egypt' is a country as large as thirteen states the size of Rhode\r\nIsland. Cairo is the Capital, and Alexandria, Thebes, and Joppa are\r\nall near by. Tamm and Buncombe, and Goreville and Omega are also\r\namong our promising cities of 'Egypt,' although you may not so\r\neasily associate them with the ancient world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well I know where Cairo is,\" Adelaide replied, \"but if your 'Egypt'\r\nis on the map you will have to show me. I know now that 'Egypt' is\r\nin Southern Illinois, but how do you separate 'Egypt' from the rest\r\nof the State?\"\r\n\r\n\"We make no such separation,\" said Percy. \"But to find 'Egypt' on\r\nthe map, you need only take the State of Illinois and subtract\r\ntherefrom all that part of the corn belt situated between the\r\nMississippi River and the west line of Indiana. The southern point\r\nof 'Egypt' is at Cairo, the Capital, and it is bounded on the east,\r\nsouth, and west, by the Wabash, the Ohio, and the Mississippi; but\r\nthe north line is not only imaginary, but it is movable. In fact it\r\nis always just a few miles farther south, but I think all\r\n'Egyptians' will agree that a sand bar which is being formed below\r\nCairo between the Ohio and the Mississippi is truly 'Egyptian '\r\nterritory. If you ever visit in the West do not fail to see 'Egypt.'\r\n\r\n\"I really hope I may, sometime,\" she replied. \"We have relatives who\r\nclaim to live in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri, but I think\r\npossibly they may all be 'Egyptians,' from what you have told me\r\nabout the vast area of that great fairy empire. I know I would\r\ndearly love to go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Egypt' is the wheat belt and the fruit belt of Illinois,\" Percy\r\ncontinued. \"One of the grand old men of Illinois, Colonel N. B.\r\nMorrison, who was for years a trustee of the State University, used\r\nto be called upon for an address whenever he was present at\r\nConvocation. He always stated proudly that he lived in the 'Heart of\r\nEgypt.' He said the soil there was not so rich perhaps as in the\r\ncorn belt, but that with plenty of hard work they were able to live\r\nand to produce the finest fruit and the greatest men in America. He\r\nsaid they had to work both the top and bottom of their soil, and he\r\nexplained that they harvested wheat and apples from the top, and\r\nthen went down about 600 feet and harvested ten thousand tons of\r\ncoal to the acre, and still left enough to support the earth. I have\r\nheard him say that when he was born there was not a mile of railroad\r\nin the United States, and that he had during his own lifetime,\r\nwitnessed the practical agricultural ruin of almost whole States. He\r\nused to plead for the University to send some of her scientific men\r\nto help them to solve the problem of restoring the fertility of\r\ntheir soils down in 'Egypt'; and I am glad to say that finally the\r\nState appropriated sufficient funds so that the Illinois Experiment\r\nStation is rapidly securing the exact information needed to make\r\nthose Southern Illinois lands richer than they ever were.\r\n\r\n\"I spent several days in 'Egypt' last month and I am planning to\r\nmake another trip down there next week before deciding definitely\r\nabout purchasing our poor land farm. I am not sure but the land of\r\n'Egypt' is as poor as we ought to try to build up considering our\r\nlimited means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you think so? But Papa's land is not so poor is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not so poor in mineral plant food on the sloping areas,\r\nbut even there it is extremely poor in humus and nitrogen. However,\r\nI fear I could not enjoy farming in irregular patches of five or ten\r\nacres, and the level lands of Virginia and Maryland are so\r\nexceedingly poor, that much time and money and work will be required\r\nto put them on a paying basis. There would be no pleasure or\r\nsatisfaction in merely robbing other farms to build up mine, as some\r\nof the prosperous truck farmers and dairymen are doing. I should\r\nwant to practice a system of soil improvement of unlimited\r\napplication so that it would not be a curse to the agricultural\r\npeople, as is the case with the man who builds up his farm only at\r\nthe expense of other farms.\r\n\r\n\"We have been speaking of the development of agriculture on the\r\nsmall tracts of cultivable land in the great manufacturing States of\r\nNew England. But, if we would make a fair comparison with a State\r\nlike Illinois, we should consider some great agricultural State, as\r\nGeorgia, for example, which is also one of the original thirteen.\r\nGeorgia is a larger State than Illinois, and Georgia cultivates as\r\nmany acres of corn and cotton as we cultivate in corn. But Georgia\r\nland cannot be covered with fertilizer made from Illinois corn, nor\r\neven with seaweed and fish-scrap from the ocean. Her agriculture\r\nmust be an independent agriculture, just as the agriculture of\r\nRussia, India, and China must be, just as the agriculture of\r\nIllinois must be, and as the agriculture of all the great\r\nagricultural States must be. What is the result to date? The average\r\nyield of corn in Georgia is down to 11 bushels per acre. This is not\r\nfor half of one township, but the average of four million acres for\r\nthe last ten years; and this in spite of the fact that Georgia out\r\nmore for the common acidulated manufactured so-called complete\r\ncommercial fertilizer than any other State.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is appalling,\" said Adelaide, \"but still some larger countries\r\nare building up their lands, such as those of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"In large part by the same methods as the New England truckers and\r\ndairymen are following,\" he replied, \"and in comparison with the\r\narea and resources of their colonies and of the other great new\r\ncountries upon which they draw for food and fertilizer, they are\r\nfairly comparable with the New England States in this country. Even\r\nthe Empire of Germany is only four-fifths as large as Texas. The\r\nonly country of Europe at all comparable with the United States is\r\nRussia, and in that great country the average yield of wheat for the\r\nlast twenty years is eight and one-fourth bushels per acre, even\r\nthough, as a general practice, the land is allowed to lie fallow\r\nevery third year. The average yield for the five famine years that\r\nhave occurred during the twenty-year period was six and one-quarter\r\nbushels of wheat per acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is wretched,\" said Adelaide, \"I know about the Russian famines\r\nfor we have made contributions through our church for their relief,\r\nbut that condition can surely never come to this great rich new\r\ncountry, can it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will come just as certainly as we allow our soil fertility to\r\ndecrease and our population to increase. As a nation we have\r\nscarcely lifted a hand yet to stop the waste of fertility or to\r\nrestore exhausted lands; practically every effort put forth by the\r\nFederal government along agricultural lines having been directed\r\ntoward better seeds, control of injurious insects and fungous\r\ndiseases, exploitation of new lands by drainage and irrigation,\r\npopularly called 'reclamation,' although applied only to rich virgin\r\nsoils which can certainly be brought under cultivation at any future\r\ntime either by the Government or by private enterprise. But why\r\nshould not the Federal government make all necessary provisions to\r\nfurnish ground limestone and phosphate rock at the actual cost of\r\nquarrying, grinding, and transporting, in order that farmers on\r\nthese old depleted soils may be encouraged to adopt systems of soil\r\nimprovement; or even compelled to adopt such systems, just as they\r\nare compelled to build school houses, bridges, and battleships?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the Government would do this,\" said Adelaide, \"if the\r\nSecretary of Agriculture would recommend it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of the '_big if,'\" _Percy replied slowly, \"but I am\r\nafraid this _if _will beat the record for bigness. His soil\r\ntheorists continue to assure him that soils do not wear out, no\r\nmatter how heavily cropped, if they are only rotated and cultivated;\r\nand to support their theories they have forsaken the data from the\r\nmost carefully conducted and long continued scientific\r\ninvestigations, and indulged in a game of guessing that the\r\nincreasing productiveness of a few small countries of Europe is not\r\ndue to any necessary addition of plant food.\r\n\r\n\"But here is the depot, and I have taken almost an hour to drive\r\nthree miles. If I had hurried, you might have been back home by this\r\ntime. I am afraid I have been selfish in allowing the team to walk\r\nnearly all of the way, but they will at least be fresh for the home\r\ntrip which you promised to make in less than twenty minutes, I\r\nremember. Now if you will hold the lines, I will run into the store\r\nto get the thread. I remember the kind; I often do such errands for\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will wait while you get your ticket and find out if the train is\r\non time,\" said Adelaide, as Percy returned with the thread.\r\n\r\n\"At least fifty minutes late,\" he reported, \"and the agent said he\r\nwas glad of it for he would need about that time to make out such a\r\nlong-jointed ticket as I want. I am rather glad too, for I can watch\r\nyou to the turn in the road on the hill, which must be a mile or\r\nmore, and I will time you. You can have six minutes to make that\r\ncorner.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean I can have six minutes to get out of sight,\" she\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are out of sight,\" he ventured.\r\n\r\nAdelaide reddened. \"I shall have to tell mother what slang you use,\"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will,\" he retorted, \"for I have watched her watch you\r\nand I am sure she will agree with me. But I do feel that I owe you a\r\nsincere apology for taking up the time we have had together with\r\nthis long discussion of the things that are of such special interest\r\nto me. I have been alone with my mother so much and she is always so\r\nready and so able, I may add, to discuss any sort of business matter\r\nthat I fear I have been forgetful of your forbearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you really have not,\" Adelaide replied. \"I keep books for papa,\r\nand I am very much interested in these social and economic questions\r\nwhich are so fundamental to the perpetuity of our State and National\r\nprosperity. I have been both entertained and instructed by these\r\ndiscussions; and I might say, honored, too, that you do not consider\r\nme too young and foolish to talk of serious subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it is kind of you to make good excuses for me. You have\r\nat any rate relieved my mind of some burden, but I am sure you are\r\nthe only woman I have ever known, except my mother, who could endure\r\ndiscussions of this sort. I have so greatly enjoyed the few short\r\nvisits I have had with you. I wish I might write to you and I shall\r\nbe so much interested to learn what success your father has if he\r\nbegins a system of soil improvement. Would it be presuming to hope\r\nthat I might hear from you also?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am papa's stenographer,\" she replied, \"and perhaps he will\r\ndictate and I will write. We will be glad to hear of your safe\r\nreturn,--and you,--you might ask papa. Now, I shall soon be out of\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't,\" begged Percy. \"It is still forty-five minutes 'at\r\nleast,' before the train comes. Let me go a piece with you. I will\r\nleave my suit case here and with nothing to carry I shall easily\r\nwalk a mile in twenty minutes. May I drive, please?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will drive. I want to ask you another question, and I am\r\nafraid you would drive too fast.\r\n\r\n\"You mentioned some long-continued scientific investigations which I\r\nassumed referred to the yield of crops. What were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant such investigations as those at Rothamsted and also those\r\nconducted at Pennsylvania State College. I have some of the exact\r\ndata here in my note book.\r\n\r\n\"In 1848, Sir John Lawes and Sir Henry Gilbert began at Rothamsted,\r\nEngland, two four-year rotations. One was turnips, barley, fallow,\r\nand wheat; and the other was turnips, barley, clover, and wheat.\r\nWhenever the clover failed, which has been frequent, beans were\r\nsubstituted, in order that a legume crop should be grown every\r\nfourth year.\r\n\r\n\"The average of the last twenty years represents the average yields\r\nabout fifty years from the beginning of this rotation.\r\n\r\n\"In the legume system, as an average of the last twenty years, the\r\nuse of mineral plant food has increased the yield of turnips from\r\nless than one-half ton to more than twelve tons; increased the yield\r\nof barley from thirteen and seven-tenths bushels to twenty-two and\r\ntwo-tenths bushels; increased the yield of clover (when grown) from\r\nless than one-half ton to almost two tons; increased the yield of\r\nbeans (when grown) from sixteen bushels to twenty-eight and\r\nthree-tenths bushels; and increased the yield of wheat from\r\ntwenty-four and three-tenths bushels to thirty-eight and four-tenths\r\nbushels per acre.\r\n\r\n\"In the legume system the minerals applied have more than doubled\r\nthe value of the crops produced, have paid their cost, and made a\r\nnet profit of one hundred and forty per cent. on the investment, in\r\ndirect comparison with the unfertilized land.\r\n\r\n\"If we compare the average yield of turnips, barley, clover, and\r\nwheat of the last twenty years with the yield of turnips in 1848,\r\nbarley in 1849, clover in 1850 and wheat in 1851 we find that on the\r\nunfertilized land in this rotation of crops in fifty years the yield\r\nof turnips has decreased from ten tons to one-half ton, and the\r\nyield of barley has decreased from forty-six to fourteen bushels,\r\nthe yield of clover has decreased from two and eight-tenths tons per\r\nacre to less than one-half ton, while the yield of wheat has\r\ndecreased only from thirty bushels to twenty-four bushels. As a\r\ngeneral average the late yields are only one-third as large as they\r\nwere fifty years before on the same land. Wheat grown once in four\r\nyears has been the only crop worth raising on the unfertilized land\r\nduring the last twenty years, and even the wheat crop has distinctly\r\ndecreased in yield; although where mineral plant food was applied\r\nthe yield has increased from thirty bushels, in 18851 to\r\nthirty-eight bushels as an average of the last twenty years. In the\r\nfallow rotation on the unfertilized land the yield of wheat averaged\r\nthirty-four and five-tenths bushels during the first twenty years\r\n(1848 to 1867) and twenty-three and five-tenths bushels during the\r\nlast twenty years.\r\n\r\n\"On another Rothamsted field the phosphorus actually removed in\r\nfifty-five crops from well-fertilized land is two-thirds as much as\r\nthe total phosphorus now contained in the plowed soil of adjoining\r\nuntreated land.\r\n\r\n\"In the early 80's the Pennsylvania Agricultural Experiment Station\r\nbegan a four-year crop rotation, including corn, oats, wheat, and\r\nmixed clover and timothy.\r\n\r\n\"There are five plots in each of four different fields that have\r\nreceived no applications of plant food from the beginning. Thus,\r\nevery year the crops are carefully harvested and weighed from twenty\r\nmeasured plots of ground that receive no treatment except the\r\nrotation of crops. The difference between the average of the first\r\ntwelve years and the average of the second twelve years should\r\nrepresent the actual change in productive power during a period of\r\ntwelve years. These averages show that the yield of corn has\r\ndecreased from forty-one and seven-tenths bushels to twenty-seven\r\nand seven-tenths bushels; that the yield of oats has decreased from\r\nthirty-six and seven-tenths bushels to twenty-five bushels; that the\r\nyield of wheat has decreased only from thirteen and three-tenths\r\nbushels to twelve and eight-tenths bushels; and that the yield of\r\nhay has decreased from three thousand seventy pounds to two thousand\r\none hundred and eighty pounds.\r\n\r\n\"As a general average of these four crops the annual value of\r\nproduce from one acre has decreased from $11.05 to $8.18. Here we\r\nhave information which is almost if not quite equal in value to that\r\nfrom the Agdell rotation field at Rothamsted. While the Rothamsted\r\nexperiments cover a period of sixty years, each crop was grown but\r\nonce in four years; whereas, in the Pennsylvania experiments, there\r\nhave been four different series of plots, so that in twenty-four\r\nyears there have been twenty-four crops of corn, twenty-four crops\r\nof oats, twenty-four crops of wheat, and twenty-four crops of hay.\r\n\r\n\"Under this four-year rotation the value of the crops produced has\r\ndecreased twenty-six per cent. in twelve years. What influence will\r\nimpress that fact upon the minds of American landowners? A loss\r\namounting to more than one-fourth of the productive power of the\r\nland in a rotation with clover seeded every fourth year! This one\r\nfact is the mathematical result of four hundred and eighty other\r\nfacts obtained from twenty different pieces of measured land during\r\na period of twenty-four years.\r\n\r\n\"As an average of these twenty-four years, the addition of mineral\r\nplant food produced increases in crop yields above the unfertilized\r\nland as follows:\r\n\r\nCorn increased forty-five per cent.\r\nOats increased thirty-two per cent.\r\nWheat increased forty-two per cent.\r\nHay increased seventy-seven per cent.\r\n\r\n\"As a general average of the four crops for the twenty-four years,\r\nthe produce where mineral plant food is applied, was forty-nine per\r\ncent. above the yields of the unfertilized land, although the same\r\nrotation of crops was practiced in both cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are some of the absolute facts of science secured from\r\npractical application in the adoption and development of definite\r\nsystems of permanent prosperous agriculture, and they should be made\r\nto serve this greatest and most important industry just as the\r\nestablished facts of mathematical and physical science are made to\r\nserve in engineering.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to know about those long-continued experiments,\" said\r\nAdelaide. \"They are of fascinating interest. I have been so sorry\r\nfor grandma, and for papa and mamma, because of their increasing\r\ndiscouragement over our farm. I do hope we may profit from this fund\r\nof accumulated information which has already been secured from long\r\nyears of investigation. Surely we must endeavor to avoid in America\r\nthe awful conditions that already exist in the older agricultural\r\ncountries, where the lands are depleted and the people are brought\r\nto greater poverty than even here in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"But we have already reached the turn, and you have a mile to walk.\r\nHow much time have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty minutes yet,\" said Percy. \"Wait just a moment. Have you read\r\nLincoln's stories?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many of them, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the best one he ever told; I have copied it on a card. He\r\ntold it to a meeting of farmers at the close of an address in which\r\nhe urged them to study the science of agriculture and to adopt\r\nbetter methods of farming:\r\n\r\n\"'An Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a\r\nsentence to be ever in view, and which should be true and\r\nappropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the\r\nwords, \"And this, too, shall pass away.\" How much it expresses! How\r\nchastening in the hour of pride! How consoling in the depths of\r\naffliction! \"And this, too, shall pass away.\" And yet, let us hope,\r\nit is not quite true. Let us hope, rather, that by the best\r\ncultivation of the physical world beneath and around us, and the\r\nbest intellectual and moral world within us, we shall secure an\r\nindividual, social, and political prosperity and happiness, whose\r\ncourse shall be onward and upward, and which, while the earth\r\nendures, shall not pass away.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you that it is his best story,\" said Adelaide, as\r\nPercy finished reading and placed the card in her hand. \"Now you\r\nmust go or I shall insist upon taking you back to the station.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall stand here and time you till you reach the next turn,\" he\r\nreplied. \"Then you will be in sight of Westover. One! Two! Three!\r\nGo!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE DIAGNOSIS AND PRESCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTERBINE, ILLINOIS,\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1 903\r\n\r\nMr. T. O. Thornton, Blairville, VA.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I beg to report that I returned home a few days ago\r\nand found my mother well and busy as usual. We have definitely\r\ndecided that we will not accept your kind offer to sell us a part of\r\nyour farm, but we appreciate nevertheless the sacrifice, at least\r\nfrom the standpoint of sentiment, which Mrs. Thornton and Miss\r\nRussell were willing to make, in order to permit us to secure such a\r\nfarm as we might want in a splendid situation.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact we are thinking very seriously of purchasing a\r\nfarm in Southern Illinois. My mother much prefers to remain in\r\nIllinois, and for some reasons I have the same preference on her\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nWhile in Washington I was fortunate enough to find that a soil\r\nsurvey had been completed for your county and also that a partial\r\nultimate analysis had been made of the common loam soil of your\r\nfarm, such as we sampled. Following are the number of pounds per\r\nacre for the surface soil to a depth of six and two-thirds\r\ninches,--that is, for two million pounds of soil.\r\n\r\n610 pounds of phosphorus\r\n\r\n13,200 pounds of potassium\r\n\r\n1,200 pounds of magnesium\r\n\r\n3,430 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\nAs compared with a normal fertile soil, your land is very deficient\r\nin phosphorus and magnesium, and, as you know, the soil is acid. It\r\nis better supplied with potassium than with any other important\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that you make liberal use of magnesian\r\nlimestone,--at least two tons per acre every four or five\r\nyears,--and the initial application might better be five or even ten\r\ntons per acre if you are ready to make such an investment.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that the nitrogen content of the soil was not determined,\r\nor at least not published in the bulletin. There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that your soil is extremely deficient in organic matter and\r\nnitrogen, and you will understand that liberal use should be made of\r\nlegume crops. The known nitrogen content of legumes and other crops\r\nwill be a help to you in planning your crop rotation and the\r\ndisposition of the crops grown.\r\n\r\nAs to phosphorus, it is safe to say that in the long run fine-ground\r\nrock phosphate will prove the best investment; but for a few years\r\nit might be best to make some use of acid phosphate in addition to\r\nthe raw rock, at least until you are ready to begin turning under\r\nmore organic matter with the phosphate.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other suggestion: If you wish to make a start\r\ntoward better crops as soon as possible, you may well use some\r\nkainit,--say six hundred pounds per acre every four or five years,\r\npreferably applied with the phosphate. In the absence of decaying\r\norganic matter, the potassium of the soil becomes available very\r\nslowly. The kainit furnishes both potassium and magnesium in soluble\r\nform and it also contains sulfur and chlorin. As soon as you can\r\nprovide plenty of decaying organic matter you will probably\r\ndiscontinue the use of both kainit and acid phosphate. If you sell\r\nonly grains and animal products, the amount of potassium sold from\r\nthe farm is very small compared with your supply of that element,\r\nwhich would be sufficient for one hundred bushels of corn per acre\r\nfor seven hundred years.\r\n\r\nI have some doubt if it will be worth the expense involved to have\r\nthe samples of subsurface and subsoil analyzed at this time; but you\r\nmight save them for future use if desired.\r\n\r\nI shall always appreciate the kindness shown me by being permitted\r\nto enjoy your hospitality and to profit from the information you\r\nwere so able to give me concerning the history and general character\r\nof your lands.\r\n\r\nMy mother asks to have her kind regards extended to you and yours.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nPERCY JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\nWESTOVER, January 2, 1904. Percy Johnston, Esq., Winterbine, Ill.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND:--We were all pleased to receive your letter\r\ninforming us of your safe journey back to Illinois. I had hoped that\r\nyou might find a piece of land here in the East which would suit\r\nyou; but I am not surprised that you and your mother should prefer\r\nto remain in Illinois, because of your former associations and your\r\nbetter knowledge of the Western conditions. Northern men who come\r\nSouth often have serious difficulty to manage our negro labor.\r\n\r\nI am surprised, however, that you were able to purchase, even in\r\nSouthern Illinois, such prairie land as you describe for the price\r\nof $18 per acre. I supposed $190 an acre for your corn belt farm was\r\na good price, although it is commonly reported to us that Illinois\r\nland is selling for $150 to $200 an acre.\r\n\r\nNow, in regard to correspondence with Adelaide, let me say that we\r\ncould have no objection whatever, except that it might be\r\nmisunderstood, more especially, of course, by Professor Barstow. I\r\ndo not think I mentioned it to you, but the fact is that the\r\nProfessor and Adelaide are essentially betrothed. I do not know that\r\nthe final details are perfected, but doubtless they are, for they\r\nhave been much together during the Christmas weeks. The Barstows, as\r\nyou probably know, are still among the most prominent people of\r\nNorth Carolina. Adelaide is young yet and we respect her reticence,\r\nbut her mother and I have both given our consent and Professor\r\nBarstow has every reason to be satisfied with the reception he\r\ninvariably receives from Adelaide.\r\n\r\nI only mention this matter to you that you may understand why\r\nmisunderstanding might arise in case of such correspondence as you\r\nsuggest, even though, as Adelaide has explained, she has very\r\nnaturally become interested temporarily in some of the economic and\r\nsocial questions relating to agriculture, and would unquestionably\r\nread your letters concerning these state and national problems with\r\ncontinued interest. I shall hope, however, that she may still have\r\nthat satisfaction, for I am very deeply interested in all such\r\nquestions, and I am particularly interested to know more of the\r\ndetails of your southern Illinois farm, including the invoice of the\r\nsoil, which you say has been taken by your Experiment Station, and\r\nespecially your definite plans for the improvement of the land. I\r\nhope the name you have chosen for your farm is not so appropriate as\r\nit would be for some of our old Virginia farms.\r\n\r\nI shall also be under renewed obligation to you if I may\r\noccasionally submit questions concerning the best plans for the\r\nrestoration of Westover to its former productiveness. I have decided\r\nat least to make another trial with alfalfa next summer, following\r\nthe valuable suggestions you gave me.\r\n\r\nIn closing let me renew my assurance of our deep gratitude for the\r\nspecial service you so nobly rendered when fiendish danger\r\nthreatened my daughter. We shall always regard you as a gentleman of\r\nthe highest type. Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\nCHARLES WEST.\r\n\r\nPercy read this letter hurriedly to the end, and then slowly reread\r\nit. His mother noticed that he absent-mindedly replaced the letter\r\nin the envelope instead of reading it to her as was his custom.\r\nHowever, he laid the letter by her plate and talked with her about\r\nthe corn-shelling which was to begin as soon as the corn sheller\r\ncould be brought from the neighbor's where Percy had been helping to\r\nhaul the corn from the sheller to elevator at Winterbine. Dinner\r\nfinished, he hurried out to complete the preparations for the\r\nafternoon's work. We have no right to follow him. His mother only\r\nsaw that he went to the little granary where a few loads of corn\r\nwere to be stored for future use. Yes, she saw that he closed the\r\ndoor as he entered. Not even his mother could see her son again a\r\nchild. Women and children weep, not men. The heart strings draw\r\ntight and tighter until they tear or snap. The body is racked with\r\nthe anguish of the mind. The form reels and sinks to the floor. The\r\nhead bows low. Pent up tears fall like rain.--No, that cannot be.\r\nMen do not shed tears. If they are mental cowards and physical\r\nbrutes they pass from hence by a short and easy route and leave the\r\nburdens of life to their wives and mothers and disgraced families.\r\nIf they are Christian men they seek the only source of help.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnston watched and waited--it seemed an hour, but was only a\r\nquarter of that time till the granary door opened and she saw Percy\r\npass to the barn with a step which satisfied her mother's eye.\r\n\r\nShe drew out the letter, and from a life habit of making sure,\r\npressed the envelope to see that it contained nothing more. She\r\nnoted a slip of crumpled paper and drew it out. Upon it was written\r\nin a penciled scrawl:\r\n\r\n_\"Her grandma has not consented.\"_\r\n\r\nShe read the letter, stood for a moment as in meditation, then\r\nreplaced the slip and letter in the envelope, and laid it on Percy's\r\ndesk. The letter was plainly a man's handwriting. The envelope was\r\naddressed in a bold hand that was clearly not Mr. West's writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nPLANNING FOR LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEART-OF-EGYPT, ILLINOIS, June 16, 1904.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles West,\r\n\r\nBlue Mound, Va.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have delayed writing to you in regard to the plans\r\nfor Poorland Farm, until I could feel that we are able at least to\r\nmake an outline of tentative nature. The labor problem of a farm of\r\nthree hundred and twenty acres is of course very different from that\r\non forty acres, and we are not yet fully decided regarding our crop\r\nrotation and the disposition of the crops produced (or hoped for). I\r\nrealize that to rebuild in my life what another has torn down during\r\nhis life is a task the end of which can hardly be even dimly\r\nforeshadowed. Some friends are already beginning to ask me what\r\nresults I am getting, and they apparently feel that we must succeed\r\nor fail with a trial of a full season. I have said to them that I\r\nhave no objection whatever to discussing our plans at any time, so\r\nfar as we are yet able to make plans, but that I shall not be ready\r\nto discuss results with anyone until we begin to secure crop yields\r\nin the third rotation. This means that I am not expecting the\r\nbenefits of a six-year rotation of crops before the rotation has\r\nbeen actually practiced. You will understand of course that, if all\r\nyour land had been cropped with little or no change, for all its\r\nhistory, you would require six or eight years' time before you would\r\nbe able to grow a crop of corn on land that had been pastured for\r\nsix or eight years; but some people seem to take it for granted that\r\none can adopt a six-year rotation and enjoy the full benefits of it\r\nthe first season.\r\n\r\nI remember that you were surprised that I could buy a level upland\r\nfarm even in this part of Illinois for $18 an acre; but you will\r\nprobably be more surprised to learn that this farm had not paid the\r\nprevious owners two per cent. interest on $18 an acre as an average\r\nof the last five years. In fact, sixty acres of it had grown no\r\ncrops for the last five years. It was largely managed by tenants on\r\nthe basis of share rent, and because of this I have been able to\r\nsecure the records of several years.\r\n\r\nI at least had some satisfaction in purchasing this farm, for the\r\nreal estate men were left without a single \"talking point.\" I\r\ninsisted that I wanted the poorest prairie farm in \"Egypt,\" and\r\nwhenever they began to tell me that the soil on a certain farm was\r\nreally above the average, or that the land had been well cared for\r\nuntil recently, or that it had been fertilized a good deal, etc., I\r\nat once informed them that any advantage of that sort completely\r\ndisqualified any farm for me; and that they need not talk to me\r\nabout any farms except those that represented the poorest and most\r\nabused in Southern Illinois.\r\n\r\nI may say, however, that $20 an acre is about the average price of\r\nthe average land. I had an option on a three hundred and sixty acre\r\nfarm cornering the corporation limits of the County Seat for $30 an\r\nacre, and all agreed that the farm was above the average in quality.\r\n\r\nHeart-of-Egypt is a small station on the double track of the\r\nChicago-New Orleans line of the Illinois Central, and there are\r\nthree other railroads passing through our County Seat. Poorland Farm\r\nis less than two miles from Heart-of-Egypt and only five miles from\r\nthe County Seat, with level roads to both.\r\n\r\nAs to the soil, I may say that in some respects it is poorer than\r\nyours, but in others not so poor. The amount of plant food contained\r\nin six and two-thirds inches of the surface soil of an acre,\r\nrepresenting two million pounds of soil, are as follows:\r\n\r\n2,880 pounds of nitrogen\r\n\r\n840 pounds of phosphorus\r\n\r\n24,940 pounds of potassium\r\n\r\n6,740 pounds of magnesium\r\n\r\n14,660 pounds of calcium\r\n\r\nBy referring to the invoice of your most common land, you will see\r\nthat Westover is richer in phosphorus, in magnesium, and in calcium,\r\nthan Poorland Farm. But, while your soil contains a half more of\r\nthat rare element phosphorus, ours contains a half more of the\r\nabundant element potassium. In the supply of nitrogen we have a\r\ndistinct advantage, because our soil contains nearly three times as\r\nmuch as your most common cultivated land, and even twice as much as\r\nyour level upland soil, which you consider too poor for farming, but\r\nin which phosphorus and not nitrogen must be the first limiting\r\nelement, the same as with ours.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the nitrogen problem in the East was one of the\r\nreasons why we have chosen to locate in Southern Illinois. I am\r\nconfident that the level lands I saw about Blairville and over in\r\nMaryland are more deficient in organic matter and nitrogen than your\r\nuncultivated level upland, and probably even more deficient than\r\nyour common gently sloping cultivated lands, because of your long\r\nrotation with much opportunity for nitrogen fixation by such legumes\r\nwill grow in your meadows and pastures, including the red clover\r\nwhich you regularly sow, the white clover, which is very persistent,\r\nand the Japan clover, which it seems to me has really benefited you\r\nmore than the others.\r\n\r\nTo me a difference in nitrogen content of two thousand pounds per\r\nacre signifies a good deal. It plainly signifies a hundred years' of\r\n\"working the soil for all that's in it,\" beyond what has yet been\r\ndone to our \"Egypt.\" The cost of two thousand pounds of nitrogen in\r\nsodium nitrate would be at least $300 and even that would not\r\ninclude the organic matter, which has value for its own sake because\r\nof the power of its decomposition products to liberate the mineral\r\nelements from the soil, as witness the most common upland soils of\r\nSt. Mary county, Maryland, with a phosphorus content reduced to one\r\nhundred and sixty pounds per acre in two million pounds of the\r\nignited soil. The ten-inch plows of Maryland, the twelve-inch of\r\nSouthern Illinois, the fourteen-inch of the corn belt, and the\r\nsixteen-inch of the newer regions of the Northwest, signify\r\nsomething as to the influence of organic matter upon the horsepower\r\nrequired in tillage; and the organic matter also has a value because\r\nit increases the power of the soil to absorb and retain moisture and\r\nto resist surface washing and \"running together\" to form the hard\r\nsurface crust.\r\n\r\nTo think of applying two thousand pounds of nitrogen by plowing\r\nunder two hundred tons of manure or forty tons of clover per acre at\r\nleast requires a \"big think,\" as my Swede man would say.\r\n\r\nOf course, with our western life and cosmopolitan population, where\r\n\"a man's a man for a' that,\" mother feels that it would not be easy\r\nfor us to fit into your somewhat distinctly stratified society. We\r\nwould not be \"colored\" if we could, and perhaps we could not be\r\naristocratic if we would; and the opportunity to become, or, perhaps\r\nI should say, to remain, \"poor white trash,\" though wide open, is\r\nnot very alluring. I realize, of course, that there are some\r\nwhole-souled people like the West's and Thornton's, but I also found\r\nsome of the tribe of Jones, and I have much doubt as to the social\r\nstanding of one who would feel obliged to demonstrate that he could\r\nspread more manure in a day than his hired nigger.\r\n\r\nMy Swede and I are like brothers; we clean stables together and talk\r\npolitics, science, and agriculture. In fact he is as much interested\r\nas I am in the building up of Poorland Farm, and has already\r\ncontributed some very practical suggestions. I pay him moderate\r\nwages and a small percentage of the farm receipts after deducting\r\ncertain expenses which he can help to keep as low as possible, such\r\nas for labor, repairs, and purchase of feed and new tools, but\r\nwithout deducting the taxes or interest on investment or the cost of\r\nany permanent improvements, such as the expense for limestone,\r\nphosphate, new fences and buildings, and breeding stock.\r\n\r\nReferring again to the invoice of the soil, I may say that the\r\npercentage of the mineral plant foods increases with depth, the same\r\nas in your soil, but not to such an extent, and with one exception.\r\nThe phosphorus content of our surface soil is greater than that of\r\nthe subsurface, but below the subsurface the phosphorus again\r\nincreases. This is probably due to the fact that the prairie grasses\r\nthat grew here for centuries extracted some phosphorus from the\r\nsubsurface in which their roots fed to some extent, and left it in\r\nthe organic residues which accumulated in the surface soil.\r\n\r\nAside from the difference in organic matter, the physical character\r\nof our soil is distinctly inferior to the loam soils about\r\nBlairville and Leonardtown. We have a very satisfactory silt loam\r\nsurface, but the structure of our subsoil is quite objectionable. It\r\nis a tight clay through which water passes very slowly, so slowly\r\nthat the practicability of using tile-drainage is still questioned\r\nby the State University, although the experiments which the\r\nUniversity soil investigators have already started in several\r\ncounties here in \"Egypt\" will ultimately furnish us positive\r\nknowledge along this line.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I purpose making no experiments, whatever. I do not see\r\nhow I or any other farmer can afford to put our limited funds into\r\nexperiments, especially when we often lack the facilities for taking\r\nthe exact and complete data that are needed. It takes time and labor\r\nand some equipment to make accurate measurements, to weigh every\r\npound of fertilizer applied and every crop carefully harvested from\r\nmeasured and carefully seeded areas, especially selected because of\r\ntheir uniform and representative character. I think this is public\r\nbusiness and it is best done by the State for the benefit of all.\r\n\r\nI have heard narrow politicians call it class legislation to\r\nappropriate funds for such agricultural investigations, but the fact\r\nis that to investigate the soil and to insure an abundant use of\r\nlimestone, phosphate, or other necessary materials required for the\r\nimprovement and permanent maintenance of the fertility of the soil\r\nis legislation for all the people, both now and hereafter. Would\r\nthat our Statesmen would think as much of maintaining this most\r\nimportant national resource, as they do of maintaining our national\r\nhonor by means of battleships and an army and navy supported at an\r\nexpense of three hundred million dollars a year, sufficient to\r\nfurnish ten tons of limestone to every acre of Virginia land, an\r\namount twenty times the Nation's appropriation for agriculture; and\r\neven this is largely used in getting new lands ready for the\r\nbleeding process, instead of reviving those that have been\r\npractically bled to death.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I shall simply take the results which prove profitable on\r\nthe accurately conducted experiment fields of the University of\r\nIllinois, one of which is located only seven miles from Poorland\r\nFarm, and on the same type of soil, I shall try to profit by that\r\npositive information, and await the accumulation of conclusive data\r\nrelating to tile-drainage and other possible improvements of\r\nuncertain practicability for \"Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nSay, but our soil is acid! The University soil survey men say that\r\nthe acidity is positive in the surface, comparative in the\r\nsubsurface, and superlative in the subsoil. Two of them insisted\r\nthat the subsoil has an acid taste. The analysis of a set of soil\r\nsamples collected near Heart-of-Egypt shows that to neutralize the\r\nacidity of the surface soil will require seven hundred and eighty\r\npounds of limestone per acre, while three tons are required for the\r\nfirst twenty inches, and sixteen tons for the next twenty inches.\r\nThe tight clay stratum reaches from about twenty to thirty-six\r\ninches. Above this is a flour-like gray layer varying in thickness\r\nfrom an inch to ten inches, but below the tight clay the subsoil\r\nseems to be more porous, and I am hoping that we may lay tile just\r\nbelow the tight clay and then puncture that clay stratum with red\r\nclover roots and thus improve the physical condition of the soil. I\r\nasked Mr. Secor, a friend who operates a coal mine,--and farms for\r\nrecreation,--if he thought alfalfa could be raised on this type of\r\nsoil. He replied: \"That depends on what kind of a gimlet it has on\r\nits tap root.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the farmers down here tell me confidentially that \"hardpan\"\r\nhas been found on their neighbors' farms, but I have not talked with\r\nany one who has any on his own farm. I am very glad the University\r\nhas settled the matter very much to the comfort of us \"Egyptians,\"\r\nby reporting that no true \"hardpan\" exists in Illinois, although\r\nthere are extensive areas underlain with tight clay, \"of whom, as it\r\nwere, we are which.\"\r\n\r\nI am glad that the nitrogen-fixing and nitrifying bacteria do\r\nbusiness chicfly in the surface soil, because we are not prepared to\r\ncorrect the acidity to any very great depth.\r\n\r\nThe present plan is to practice a six-year rotation on six\r\nforty-acre fields, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst year--Corn (and legume catch crop).\r\n\r\nSecond year--Part oats or barley, part cowpeas or soy beans.\r\n\r\nThird year--Wheat.\r\n\r\nFourth year--Clover, or clover and timothy.\r\n\r\nFifth year--Wheat, or clover and timothy.\r\n\r\nSixth year--Clover, or clover and timothy.\r\n\r\nThis plan may be a grain system where wheat is grown the fifth year,\r\nonly clover seed being harvested the fourth and sixth years, or it\r\nmay be changed to a live-stock system by having clover and timothy\r\nfor pasture and meadow the last three years, which may be best for a\r\ntime, perhaps, if we find it too hard to care for eighty acres of\r\nwheat on poorly drained land.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat greater detail the system may be developed we hope about\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nFirst year: Corn, with mixed legumes, seeded at the time of the last\r\ncultivation, on perhaps one-half of the field. These legumes may\r\ninclude some cowpeas and soy beans and some sweet clover, but that\r\nis not yet fully decided upon.\r\n\r\nSecond year: Oats (part barley, perhaps) on twenty acres, cowpeas on\r\nten acres, and soy beans on ten acres. The peas and beans are to be\r\nseeded on the twenty acres where the catch crop of legumes is to be\r\nplowed under as late in the spring as practicable.\r\n\r\nThird year: Wheat with alsike on twenty acres and red clover on the\r\nother twenty, seeded in the early spring. If necessary to prevent\r\nthe clover or weeds from seeding, the field will be clipped about\r\nthe last of August.\r\n\r\nFourth year: Harvest the red clover for hay and the alsike for seed,\r\nand apply limestone after plowing early for wheat.\r\n\r\nFifth year: Wheat, with alsike and red clover seeded and clipped as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nSixth year: Pasture in early summer, then clip if necessary to\r\nsecure uniformity, and later harvest the red clover for seed. Manure\r\nmay be applied to any part of this field from the time of wheat\r\nharvest the previous year until the close of the pasture period.\r\nThen it may be applied to the alsike only until the red clover seed\r\ncrop is removed, and then again to any part of the field, which may\r\nalso be used for fall pasture. To this field the threshed clover\r\nstraw and all other straw not needed for feed and bedding will be\r\napplied. The application of raw phosphate will be made to this\r\nfield, and all of this material plowed under for corn.\r\n\r\nThe second six years is to be a repetition of the first, except that\r\nthe alsike and red clover will be interchanged, so as to avoid the\r\ndevelopment of clover sickness if possible; and to keep the soil\r\nuniform we may interchange the oats with the peas and beans.\r\n\r\nThis system provides for the following crops each year:\r\n\r\n40 acres of corn;\r\n\r\n20 acres of oats;\r\n\r\n10 acres of cowpeas for hay\r\n\r\n10 acres of soy beans for seed\r\n\r\n80 acres of wheat\r\n\r\n20 acres of red clover for hay\r\n\r\n20 acres of alsike for seed\r\n\r\n20 acres of red clover for seed\r\n\r\n20 acres of alsike for pasture, except from June to August.\r\n\r\nWe also have some permanent pasture which we may use at any time\r\nthat may seem best. If necessary we may cut all the clover for hay\r\nthe fourth year, and we may pasture all summer the sixth year. We\r\ncan pasture the corn stalks during the fall and winter when the\r\nground is in suitable condition.\r\n\r\nWe plan to raise our own horses and perhaps some to sell. In\r\naddition we may raise a few dairy cows for market, but will do\r\nlittle dairying ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe expect to sell wheat and some corn, and if successful we shall\r\nsell some soy beans, alsike seed, and red clover seed.\r\n\r\nHow soon we shall be able to get this system fully under way I shall\r\nnot try to predict; but we shall work toward this end unless we\r\nthink we have good reason to modify the plan.\r\n\r\nI hope to make the initial application of limestone five tons per\r\nacre, but after the first six years this will be reduced to two or\r\nthree tons. I also plan to apply at least one ton per acre of\r\nfine-ground raw phosphate every six years until the phosphorus\r\ncontent of the plowed soil approaches two thousand pounds per acre,\r\nafter which the applications will probably be reduced to about\r\none-half ton per acre each rotation.\r\n\r\nThere are three things that mother and I are fully decided upon:\r\n\r\nFirst, that we shall use ground limestone in sufficient amounts to\r\nmake the soil a suitable home for clover.\r\n\r\nSecond, that we shall apply fine-ground rock phosphate in such\r\namounts as to positively enrich our soil in that very deficient\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nThird, that we shall reserve a three-rod strip across every\r\nforty-acre field as an untreated check strip to which neither\r\nlimestone nor phosphate shall ever be applied, and that we shall\r\nreserve another three-rod strip to which limestone is applied\r\nwithout phosphate, while the remaining thirty-seven acres are to\r\nreceive both limestone and phosphate.\r\n\r\nThus we shall always have the satisfaction of seeing whatever\r\nclearly apparent effects are produced by this fundamental treatment,\r\neven though we may not be able to bother with harvesting these check\r\nstrips separate from the rest of the field.\r\n\r\nWe have based our decision regarding the use of ground limestone\r\nvery largely upon the long-continued work of the Pennsylvania\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station as to the comparative effects of\r\nground limestone and burned lime, which is supported, to be sure, by\r\nall comparative tests so far as our Illinois soil investigators have\r\nbeen able to learn.\r\n\r\nThe practicability and economy of using the fineground natural\r\nphosphate has been even more conclusively established, as you\r\nalready know, by the concordant results of half a dozen state\r\nexperiment stations. There are only two objections to the use of the\r\nraw phosphate. One of these is the short-sighted plan or policy of\r\nthe average farmer, and the other is the combined influence of about\r\nfour-hundred fertilizer manufacturers who prefer to sell, quite\r\nnaturally, perhaps, two tons of acid phosphate for $30, or four tons\r\nof so-called \"complete\" fertilizer for $70 to $90, rather than to\r\nsee the farmer buy direct from the phosphate mine one ton of\r\nfine-ground raw rock phosphate in which he receives the same amount\r\nof phosphorus, at a cost of $7 to $9.\r\n\r\nUntil we can provide a greater abundance of decaying organic matter\r\nwe may make some temporary use of kainit, in case the experiments\r\nconducted by the state show that it is profitable to do so.\r\n\r\nIn a laboratory experiment, made at college it was shown that when\r\nraw phosphate was shaken with water and then filtered, the filtrate\r\ncontained practically no dissolved phosphorus; but, if a dilute\r\nsolution of such salts as exist in kainit was used in place of pure\r\nwater, then the filtrate would contain very appreciable amounts of\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this benefit, the kainit will furnish some readily\r\navailable potassium, magnesium, and sulfur; and, by purchasing\r\nkainit in carload lots, the potassium will cost us less than it\r\nwould in the form of the more expensive potassium chlorid or\r\npotassium sulfate purchased in ton lots. Of course we do not need\r\nthis in order to add to our total stock of potassium, but more\r\nespecially I think to assist in liberating phosphorus from the raw\r\nphosphate which is naturally contained in the soil and which we\r\nshall also apply to the soil, unless the Government permits the\r\nfertilizer trusts to get such complete control of our great natural\r\nphosphate deposits that they make it impossible for farmers to\r\nsecure the fine-ground rock at a reasonable cost, which ought not, I\r\nwould say, to be more than one hundred per cent. net profit above\r\nthe expense of mining, grinding, and transportation. We may feel\r\nsafe upon the matter of transportation rates, for the railroads are\r\noperated by men of large enough vision to see that the positive and\r\npermanent maintenance of the fertility of the soil is the key to\r\ntheir own continued prosperity, and some of them are already\r\nbeginning to understand that the supply of phosphorus is the master\r\nkey to the whole industrial structure of America; for, with a\r\nfailing supply of phosphorus, neither agriculture nor any dependent\r\nindustry can permanently prosper in this great country.\r\n\r\nIf we retain the straw on the farm and sell only the grain, the\r\nsupply of potassium in the surface soil of Poorland Farm is\r\nsufficient to meet the needs of a fifty bushel crop of wheat per\r\nacre every year for nineteen hundred and twenty years, or longer\r\nthan the time that has passed since the Master walked among men on\r\nthe earth; whereas, the total phosphorus content of the same soil is\r\nsufficient for only seventy such crops, or for as long as the full\r\nlife of one man. Keep in mind that Poorland Farm is near\r\nHeart-of-Egypt, and that this is the common soil of our \"Egyptian\r\nEmpire,\" which contains more cultivable land than all New England,\r\nhas the climate of Virginia, and a network of railroads scarcely\r\nequalled in any other section of this country, and in addition it is\r\nmore than half surrounded by great navigable rivers.\r\n\r\nOn Poorland Farm there are seven forty-acre fields which are at\r\nleast as nearly level as they ought to be to permit good surface\r\ndrainage, and there is no need that a single hill of corn should be\r\nomitted on any one of these seven fields; and I am confident that\r\nwith an adequate supply of raw phosphate rock and magnesian\r\nlimestone and a liberal use of legume crops this land can be made to\r\npay interest on $300 an acre.\r\n\r\nWhy not? At Rothamsted, England, they have averaged thirty-eight and\r\nfour-tenths bushels of wheat per acre during the last twenty years\r\nin an experiment extending over sixty years, and they have done this\r\nwithout a forkful of manure or a pound of purchased nitrogen. Why\r\nnot? The wheat alone from eighty acres of land, if it yielded forty\r\nbushels per acre and sold at $1 a bushel, would pay nearly five per\r\ncent. interest on $300 an acre for the entire two hundred and forty\r\nacres used in my suggested rotation.\r\n\r\nAye, but there is one other very essential requirement: To wit, a\r\nworld of work.\r\n\r\nHoping to hear from you, and especially about your alfalfa, I am,\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nPERCY JOHNSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nSEALED LIPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one realized more than Percy Johnston that toleration of life\r\nitself was possible to him only because of the world of work that he\r\nfound always at hand in connection with his abiding faith and\r\ninterest in the upbuilding of Poorland Farm. He had accepted\r\nAdelaide's sweet smile and lack of apparent disapproval with\r\nconfidence that he might at least have an opportunity to try to win\r\nher love. As he was permitted at the parting to look for more than\r\nan instant into those alluring eyes, he felt so sure that they\r\nexpressed something more than friendship or gratitude for him. He\r\nhad felt the more confidence because he thought he knew that she\r\nwould not permit him to humiliate himself by asking and failing to\r\nreceive from her father permission to write to her, when she could\r\neasily in her own womanly way have discouraged such a thought at\r\nonce. Had she not insisted upon driving slowly back to the turn in\r\nthe road, and did he not feel the absence of a previous reserve?\r\n\r\nOh, misleading imagination. The will is truly the father of thought\r\nand faith. Percy knew as he parted from Adelaide that he had left\r\nwith her the love of heart and mind of one whose life had developed\r\nin him the character which does nothing by halves. His love had\r\nmultiplied with the distance as he journeyed westward, with a great\r\nnew pleasure which life seemed to hold before him and with a\r\npardonable confidence in its achievement.\r\n\r\nHe had written Mr. West a week after his return in a way which would\r\nnot fail of understanding if his hopes were justified. The belated\r\nreply which reached him after holidays was accepted as final. His\r\npride was humiliated and the sweetest dream of his life abruptly\r\nended. He felt the more helpless and the more deeply wounded because\r\nof Mr. West's reference to his special service in the protection he\r\nhad once rendered to Adelaide. It continually reminded him that, as\r\nthe highest type of gentleman, he should do nothing that could be\r\nconstrued as an endeavor to take advantage of the consideration to\r\nwhich that act might seem to entitle him. Bound and buried in the\r\ndeepest dungeon, waiting only for the announcement from his of the\r\nday of his execution. This was his mental attitude as the months\r\npassed and he began to receive an occasional letter from Mr. West,\r\nin each of which he looked for the news of Adelaide's marriage.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Johnston a feeling of hatred had developed for Adelaide. She\r\nwas certain that she had marred the happiness of her son. The\r\nheartlessness of a flirt who could trifle with the affection of one\r\nwho had a right to assume in her an honor equal to his own deserved\r\nonly to be hated with even righteous hatred. She saw the scrawled\r\nnote which she knew Percy had not seen, but what did it signify? An\r\neccentric old lady's penchant for match making? Perhaps she was\r\neven more guilty than the girl in attempting to lead Percy to see in\r\nAdelaide more than he ought. She might even take an old flirt's\r\ndelight in the mere number of conquests made by her granddaughter.\r\nOr was the scrawled note slipped into the envelope by a prank-\r\nplaying fourteen-year-old brother? In any case was it wise that\r\nPercy should see the note? She could probably do nothing better than\r\nto leave it with the letter. Even if the girl were worthy, Percy\r\ncould never hope to win one of her class, whose pride of ancestry is\r\ntheir bread of life. It might not have been quite so, perhaps, if\r\nPercy had only selected some more respected profession. Why should\r\nnot he have become a college professor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nHARD TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Percy and his mother reached Poorland Farm in March they found\r\na small frame house needing only shingles, paint, and paper to make\r\nit a fairly comfortable home, until they should be able to add such\r\nconveniences as Percy knew could be installed in the country as well\r\nas in the city. From the sale of corn and some other produce they\r\nwere able to add to the residue of $1,840, which represented the\r\ndifference between the cost of three hundred and twenty acres in\r\nEgypt and the selling price of forty acres in the corn belt. An even\r\n$3,000 was left in the savings bank at Winterbine.\r\n\r\n\"If we can live,\" said Percy, \"just as the other 'Egyptians' must\r\nlive, and save our $3,000 for limestone and phosphate, I believe we\r\nshall win out. Through the efforts of the Agricultural College and\r\nthe Governor of the State the convicts in the Southern Illinois\r\nPenitentiary have been put to quarrying stone, and large crushers\r\nand grinders have been installed, and the State Board of Prison\r\nIndustries is already beginning to ship ground limestone direct to\r\nfarmers at sixty cents a ton in bulk in box cars. The entire\r\nIllinois Freight Association gave an audience to the Warden of the\r\nPenitentiary and representatives from the Agricultural College and a\r\nuniform freight rate has been granted of one-half cent per ton per\r\nmile. This will enable us to secure ground limestone delivered at\r\nHeart-of-Egypt for $1.22-1/2 per ton.\r\n\r\n\"Now, to apply five tons per acre on two hundred and forty acres\r\nwill require one thousand two hundred tons and that will cost us\r\n$1,570 in cash, less perhaps the $70, which we save on roads and the\r\nuntreated check strips which I want to leave. To apply one ton of\r\nphosphate per acre to the same six fields will cost about $1,600. Of\r\ncourse, I shall not begin to apply phosphate until after I have\r\napplied the limestone and get some clover or manure to mix with the\r\nphosphate when I plow it under; and I hope with the help of the\r\nlimestone we shall get some clover and some increase in the other\r\ncrops. In any case the $3,000 and interest we will get for what we\r\ncan leave in the bank during the six or eight years it will take to\r\nget the rotation and treatment under way will pay for the initial\r\ncost of the first applications of both limestone and phosphate; and\r\nwe shall hope that by that time the farm will bring us something\r\nmore than a living.\"\r\n\r\nThe carload of effects shipped from Winterbine to Heart-of-Egypt\r\nincluded two horses, a cow, a few breeding hogs, and some chickens;\r\nalso a supply of corn and oats sufficient for the summer's feed\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nAfter the expenses of shipping were paid, less than $350 were\r\ndeposited in the bank at the County Seat. Of this $250 were used for\r\nthe purchase of another team. Hay was bought from a neighbor and\r\nsome old hay that had been discarded by the balers, who had\r\npurchased, baled, and sold the previous hay crop from Poorland Farm,\r\nPercy gathered up and saved for bedding.\r\n\r\nHe plowed forty acres of the land that had not been cropped for five\r\nyears, and, after some serious delays on account of wet weather,\r\nplanted the field in corn, using the Champion White Pearl variety,\r\nbe cause the Experiment Station had found it to be one of the best\r\nvarieties for poor land.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't plant that corn if you would give me the seed,\" a\r\nneighbor had said to him. \"See how big the cob is; and the tip is\r\nnot well filled out, and there is too much space between the rows. I\r\ntell you there's too much cob in it for me. I want to raise corn and\r\nnot corn cob.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly is not a good show ear,\" said Percy, \"but what I want\r\nmost is bushels of shelled corn per acre. Perhaps these big kernels\r\nwill help to give the young plant a good start, and perhaps the\r\npiece of cob extending from the tip will make room for more kernels\r\nif the soil can be built up so as to furnish the plant food to make\r\nthem. The cob is large but it is covered with grains all the way\r\naround; and, if those kernels of corn were putty, we could mash them\r\ndown a little and have less space between the rows, but it would\r\nmake no more corn on the ear. However, my chief reason for planting\r\nthe Champion White Pearl is that this variety has produced more\r\nshelled corn per acre than any other in the University experiments\r\non the gray prairie soil of 'Egypt.'\"\r\n\r\nThere were only sixteen acres of corn grown on the entire farm in\r\n1903 and this yielded thirteen bushels per acre, as Percy learned\r\nfrom the share of the crop received by the previous landowner.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the Champion White Pearl yielded twenty bushels per acre, as\r\nnearly as could be determined by weighing the corn from a few shocks\r\non a small truck scale Percy had brought from the north. He numbered\r\nhis six forty-acre fields from one to six. Forty No. 7 was occupied\r\nby twelve acres of apple orchard, eight acres of pasture, and twenty\r\nacres of old meadow. By getting eighty rods of fencing it was\r\npossible to include twenty-eight acres in the pasture, although one\r\nhundred and ninety-two rods of fencing had been required to surround\r\nthe eight-acre pasture. The remainder of the farm was in patches,\r\nincluding about fifteen acres on one corner crossed by a little\r\nvalley and covered with trees, a tract which Percy and his mother\r\ntreasured above any of the forty-acre fields. While the week was\r\nalways filled with work, there were many hours of real pleasure\r\nfound in the wood's pasture on the Sunday afternoons.\r\n\r\nForty No. I was left to \"lie out,\" and No. 2 raised only twelve\r\nacres of cowpeas. No. 3 was plowed during the summer and seeded to\r\ntimothy in the early fall. No. 4 was in corn and Nos. 5 and 6 were\r\nleft in meadow, two patches of nine and sixteen acres previously in\r\ncowpeas and corn having been seeded to timothy in order, as Percy\r\nsaid, to \"square out\" the forty-acre fields. About fifty acres of\r\nland were cut over for about sixteen tons of hay. The corn was all\r\nput in shock, and the fodder as well as the grain used for feed, the\r\nrefuse from the fodder and poor hay serving as bedding. About three\r\ntons of cowpea hay of excellent quality were secured from the twelve\r\nacres, and fifty barrels of apples were put in storage.\r\n\r\nAnother cow and eight calves were bought, and during the winter,\r\nsome butter, two small bunches of the last spring's pigs, and the\r\napple crop were sold. A few eggs had been sold almost every week\r\nsince the previous March.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 No. 1 was rented for corn on shares and produced about six\r\nhundred bushels of which Percy received one-third. No. 2 yielded\r\nfour hundred and eighty-four bushels of oats. No. 3 produced\r\nfourteen tons of poor hay. No. 4 was \"rested\" and prepared for\r\nwheat, ground limestone having been applied. No. 5 was fall-plowed\r\nfrom old meadow and well prepared and planted to corn in good time;\r\nbut, after the second cultivation, heavy rains set in and continued\r\nuntil the corn was seriously damaged on the flat areas of the field,\r\nthe more so as he had not fully understood the importance of keeping\r\nfurrows open with outlets at the head-lands through which the excess\r\nsurface water could pass off quickly under such weather conditions.\r\nPatches of the field aggregating at least five acres were so poorly\r\nsurface drained that the corn was \"drowned out,\" and fifteen acres\r\nmore were so wet as to greatly injure the crop. However, on the\r\nbetter drained parts of the field where the corn was given further\r\ncultivation the yield was good and about 1,000 bushels of sound corn\r\nwere gathered from the forty acres.\r\n\r\nA mixture of timothy, redtop and weeds was cut for hay on No. 6, the\r\nyield being better than half a ton per acre.\r\n\r\nThe apples were a fair crop, and the total sales from that crop\r\namounted to $750, but about half of this had been expended for\r\ntrimming and spraying the trees, a spraying outfit, barrels,\r\npicking, packing, freight and cold storage. A good bunch of hogs\r\nwere sold.\r\n\r\nAnother year passed. Oats were grown on No. 1 and on part of No. 2,\r\nyielding eleven bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 yielded one-third of a ton of hay per acre.\r\n\r\nWheat was grown on No. 4, and clover, the first the land had known\r\nin many years, if ever, was seeded in the spring,--twenty acres of\r\nred clover and twenty of alsike.\r\n\r\nThe fifty-four acres of wheat, including fourteen acres on No. 2,\r\nyielded seven and one-half bushels per acre. Soy beans were planted\r\non No. 5, but wet weather seriously interferred and only part of the\r\nfield was cut for hay. Limestone was applied, but heavy continued\r\nrains prevented the seeding of wheat.\r\n\r\nNo. 6 produced about twenty-seven bushels per acre of corn.\r\n\r\nTwo lots of hogs were sold for about $800, and some young steers\r\nincreased the receipts by nearly $100.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johnston continued to buy the groceries with eggs and butter;\r\nbut it was necessary to buy some hay, and the labor bill was heavy.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 joined the twenty-eight acre pasture and on two other sides it\r\njoined neighbors' farms where line fences were up, and on the other\r\nside lay No. 4.\r\n\r\nPercy was trying to get ready to pasture the clover on No. 4, and a\r\nmile of new fencing was required. The materials were bought and the\r\nfence built, and when finished it also completed the fencing\r\nrequired to enclose No. 5. The twenty-eight acre pasture was\r\ninadequate for sixteen head of cattle and the young stock was kept\r\nin a hired pasture. Unless he could produce more feed, Percy saw\r\nthat the farm would soon be overstocked, for some colts were growing\r\nand eight cows were now giving milk.\r\n\r\nHis hope was in the clover, but as the fall came on the red clover\r\nwas found to have failed almost completely, and the alsike was\r\none-half a stand. As the red clover had been seeded on the unlimed\r\nstrip there was no way of knowing whether the limestone had even\r\nbenefited the alsike. The neighbors had \"seen just as good clover\r\nwithout putting on any of that stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThere were no apples, but the spraying had cost as much as ever, and\r\nsome team work had been hired.\r\n\r\nThree years of the hardest work; limestone on two forties, but only\r\ntwenty acres of poor clover on one and no wheat seeded on the other.\r\nThe neighbors \"knew the clover would winter kill.\" The bills for\r\npasturing amounted to as much as the butter had brought; for the\r\ntwenty-eight-acre pasture had been very poor. The feed for the cows\r\nfor winter consisted of corn fodder, straw and poor hay, and not\r\nenough of that.\r\n\r\nThey had to do it--draw $150 from the Winterbine reserve, besides\r\nwhat had been used for limestone. Part of it must go for clover\r\nseed, for clover must be seeded before it could be grown. The small\r\nbarn must also be enlarged, but with the least possible expense.\r\n\r\nIt was February. Wet snow, water, and almost bottomless mud covered\r\nthe earth. With four horses on the wagon, Percy had worked nearly\r\nall day bringing in two \"jags\" of poor hay from the stack in the\r\nfield. It was all the little mow would hold.\r\n\r\nHe had finished the chores late and came in with the milk.\r\n\r\n\"Put on some dry clothes and your new shoes,\" said his mother,\r\n\"while I strain the milk and take up the supper. There is a letter\r\non the table. I hardly see how the mail man gets along through these\r\nroads. They must be worse than George Rogers Clark found on his trip\r\nfrom Kaskaskia to Vincennes. They say his route passed across only a\r\nfew miles from the present site of Heart-of-Egypt. I suppose the\r\nletter is from Mr. West.\"\r\n\r\nPercy finished washing his hands, and opened the letter. Two cards\r\nfell to the table as he drew the letter from the envelope.\r\n\r\nHe picked up one of the cards, and read it aloud to his mother:\r\n\r\n_Mr. and Mrs. Strongworth Barstow\r\n\r\n__At home after March I, 1907\r\n\r\n1422 College Avenue\r\n\r\nRaleigh, N. C._\r\n\r\n_\"With Grandma's Compliments,\"_ was penciled across the top of the\r\ncard. Percy glanced at the other card and read the plain lines:\r\n\r\n_Announce the marriage of their daughter_\r\n\r\nDid his eyes blurr? He laid the one card over the other, scanned Mr.\r\nWest's letter hurriedly, replaced it with the cards in the envelope,\r\nand laid the letter at his mother's plate.\r\n\r\nPercy replaced his rubber boots with shoes, and his wet, heavy coat\r\nwith a dry one.\r\n\r\n\"You remember the letter I had from the College?\" he asked, as he\r\ntook his seat at the table.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember,\" she replied, \"but the Institute was to begin\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Percy, \"but Hoard and Terry both speak\r\nto-morrow,--Terry in the morning and the Governor in the afternoon,\r\nand they are the men the Professor especially wanted me to hear, if\r\nI could. I think I'll 'phone to Bronson's and ask Roscoe to come\r\nover and do the chores to-morrow noon. I can get back by nine\r\nto-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Dear, how in the world can you get to Olney to hear Mr. Terry\r\nspeak to-morrow morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a train east about eight o'clock,\" he replied. \"Of course\r\nthe roads are too awful to think of driving to the station,\r\nespecially since the mares ought not to be used much. I put four on\r\nthe wagon to-day and tried to be as careful as possible but it does\r\nnot seem right to use them. I can manage all right. I will get up a\r\nlittle early in the morning and get things in shape so I can leave\r\nhere by daylight and I am sure I can make the B. & O. station by\r\neight o'clock easily. I will wear my rubber boots and carry my shoes\r\nin a bundle. I can change at the depot and put my boots on again\r\nwhen I get back there at seven at night. If it clears up, I will\r\nhave the moon to help coming home.\"\r\n\r\nBut, Percy, you do not mean to walk five miles and back through all\r\nthis mud and water?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would not worry, Mother. There is grass along the sides\r\nmost of the way, and I am used to the mud and water. I will spy out\r\nthe best track as I go in the morning and just follow my own trail\r\ncoming back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is time we were asleep,\" replied the mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nHARDER TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE State Superintendent of Farmers' Institutes called the meeting\r\nto order soon after Percy entered the Opera House at Olney about ten\r\no'clock the next morning.\r\n\r\n\"Divine blessing will be invoked by Doctor T. E. Sisson, pastor of\r\nthe First Methodist Church of Olney:\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Thou, whose presence bright all space doth occupy and all\r\nmotion guide, all life impart, we come this morning in the capacity\r\nof this Farmers' Institute to thank thee for Thy mercies and for Thy\r\nblessings, and to invoke Thy presence and Thy continued favor. As\r\nThou with Thy presence hast surrounded all forms of creation and all\r\nstages of being with the providences of welfare and development and\r\ngrace, so we pray, our Father, for guidance through the sessions of\r\nthis institute, for the providences of Thy love and Thy wisdom\r\ndivine as it reveals itself in the open field, in the orchard, in\r\nthe garden, bringing forth those things which replenish the earth\r\nwith food and fill the mouths of our hungry ones with bread.\r\n\r\n\"We thank Thee for this larger knowledge which has come to the minds\r\nof men, because they have been learning to study Thy works and to\r\nwalk closer to Thee. Wilt Thou, Heavenly Father, continue to\r\nenlighten this body of men and women that are represented in this\r\ngreat field of the world's busy hive so that the starving millions\r\nof the world, now in our cities rioting for bread, and in the vast\r\nnations where they are crying for food, may be fed. We pray Thee,\r\nreveal such improvement of knowledge to these who are willing to get\r\nclose to Thee to learn Thy secrets and know Thy wisdom, as that unto\r\nall shall be given plenty, for replenishing our physical needs. And\r\nhelp us to know, our Father, as we learn Thy will and seek to do Thy\r\nwill and live in the higher courts of knowledge and wider circles of\r\nthought, so shall God reveal himself unto us.\r\n\r\n\"Our Father, we thank Thee for all the developments and great\r\nsources of utility that come through the means of this institute in\r\nthe development of the resources of this country, this great State\r\nand adjoining states through the length and breadth of this favored\r\nnation. We pray, Heavenly Father, while studying all these\r\nreplenishments and seeking to defend them from the inroads of evil,\r\nof the rust and the mildew and the worm, we pray also for the\r\nbeautiful homes, for the souls of the children given to our homes,\r\nthat we may study their mental and spiritual being in such a way as\r\nshall keep all harm and evil and wrong from this life of ours, and\r\nso to work in the field of Thy providences, revealed in hand and\r\nmind and heart and relationships, of school and church and state and\r\nfarm, and all the activities of this life's great work, as that good\r\nshall be our inheritance.\r\n\r\n\"We pray Thee, Heavenly Father, to be with the officers of this\r\ninstitute. Give Thy strength, Thy presence, and Thy discernment to\r\nthese who participate in the work, the membership and onlookers, and\r\nthose who come to learn. We pray Thee, give us the revelation of Thy\r\nwisdom to replenish and build up every human family, and to Thee all\r\npraise shall be given to-day for this blessing and for Thy continued\r\nfavor; and not only to-day but to-morrow and the day after and\r\nthrough all eternity the praise shall be Thine, in the name of Him\r\nwho came into this world to give us the life of the knowledge of\r\nGod. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" said the Chairman, \"that a State Farmers' Institute\r\nsometimes exercises a little arbitrary power in selecting subjects\r\nwe want to speak of. I think county institutes might adopt the same\r\nplan to advantage, and assign the topic they wish discussed.\r\n\r\n\"The topic assigned our speaker to-day is 'What I did and how I did\r\nit.' It may sound egotistical, but I want to relieve the speaker of\r\nthat imputation, because the subject was selected by the Institute.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to present Mr. Terry, who needs no introduction to an\r\naudience of American farmers:\"\r\n\r\nMr. Terry began to speak:\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-six years ago last fall,\" he said, \"my wife and I bought and\r\nmoved onto the farm where we now reside. We went on there in debt\r\n$3,700, on which we had to pay seven per cent. interest. I had one\r\nhorse, an old one, and it had the heaves, a one-horse harness, and a\r\none-horse wagon, three tillage implements, and nine cows that were\r\npaid for; and a wife and two babies, but no money. Now that was the\r\ncondition in which we started on this farm, thirty-six years ago, in\r\ndebt heavily, and no money; but that is not the worst of it. If it\r\nhad been as good soil as you have in some parts of this State, we\r\nshould have been all right. How about the soil? For sixty years\r\nfarmers had been running it down until it could scarcely produce\r\nanything. We had a tenant on the place one year, before we could\r\narrange to move on, after we got it. They got eight bushels of wheat\r\nper acre, and he said to me, 'That is a pretty good yield, don't you\r\nthink, for this old farm?' Oh, friends, I didn't think so;--never\r\nought to have bought this farm;--didn't know any better,--born and\r\nbrought up in town, my father a minister, and I thought a farm was a\r\nfarm. But I learned some things after awhile. That tenant mowed over\r\nprobably forty acres of land. (We originally bought one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five.) He put the hay in the barn. It measured twelve tons.\r\nHalf of that was weeds. Most of the hay he cut down in a swale.\r\nThere wasn't anything worth considering on the upland. That was the\r\ncondition of the land.\r\n\r\n\"How about the buildings? The house had been used about sixty years,\r\nan old story-and-a-half house. Dilapidated, oh, my! Every time the\r\nrain came, we had to take every pan upstairs and set it to catch the\r\nwater. We did not have any money to put on more shingles. It was out\r\nof the question, we couldn't do it. How about the dooryard? It was a\r\ncow yard. They used it for a milking yard, for years and years. You\r\ncan imagine how it looked. The barn was in such condition that\r\ncattle were just as well off outdoors as in. The roof leaked\r\nterribly. The tenants had burned up the doors and any boards they\r\ncould take off easily. They were too lazy to take off any that came\r\noff hard. They burned all the fences in reach.\r\n\r\n\"Now friends, that was the farm we moved onto and the condition it\r\nwas in. Some of you will know we saw some pretty hard times for a\r\nwhile. Time and again I was obliged to take my team, after we got\r\ntwo horses (the second I borrowed of a relative, it was the only way\r\nI could get one), and go to town to do some little job hauling to\r\nget some money to get something to eat. That is the way we started\r\nfarming. I remember, after three or four years, meeting Dr. W. I.\r\nChamberlain. Some of you know him. He said: 'Terry, if you should\r\nget a new hat, there wouldn't anybody know you. Your clothes wear\r\nlike the children of Israel's.' They had to wear. No one knew how\r\nhard up we were. It was not best to let them know. That money was\r\nborrowed of a friend in Detroit, secured on a life insurance policy.\r\nWe did not let anybody know how hard up we really were. My wife rode\r\nto town (to church when she went), in the same wagon we hauled out\r\nmanure in, for a time. Time and again she had been to town when she\r\nsaid she could not do without something any longer and came back\r\nwithout it. Credit was good. We could have bought it. We didn't dare\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\"Now, friends, a dozen years from the time we started on that farm,\r\nunder these circumstances, we were getting from one hundred and\r\nfifty to two hundred and fifty bushels of merchantable potatoes per\r\nacre right along--not a single year, but on the average--varying, of\r\ncourse, somewhat with the season. We were getting from four to five\r\ntons of clover hay in a season, from two cuttings, of course, per\r\nacre. We were getting from thirty-three to thirty-eight bushels of\r\nwheat per acre, not one year, but for five years we averaged\r\nthirty-five bushels per acre, and right on that same farm. No\r\nfertility had been brought on to it, practically, from the outside.\r\nA man without any money, in debt for the land $3,700, was able to do\r\nthis. Now, how did he do it? That is the question I have been asked\r\nto talk upon. I have told you briefly something like what we have\r\naccomplished. I might say, further, the old house I told you that we\r\nlived in for fourteen years while we were building up the fertility\r\nof this soil, we sold for $10, after we got through with it. It is\r\nnow a horse barn on the farm of our next neighbor and has been\r\ncovered over.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven years from the time we started we paid the last $500 of our\r\ndebt, all dug out of that farm, not $25 from any other source.\r\nThirteen years from the time we started, we carried off the first\r\nprize of $50 offered by the State Board of Agriculture of Ohio, for\r\nthe best detailed report of the best and most profitably managed\r\nsmall farm in the state,--only thirteen years from the time we\r\nstarted on that rundown land, and no fertility brought from the\r\noutside; without any money; and meanwhile we had to live.\r\n\r\n\"Now I had arranged with the tenant the first year, before we went\r\non there, to seed down a certain field. It had been under the plow\r\nfor some time. I wanted it seeded so I could have some land to mow\r\nand he seeded half of it. It was only a little lot, about five\r\nacres. He seeded half with timothy and left the other half. That was\r\nhis way of doing things, anyway. When we moved onto the farm later I\r\nnaturally wanted to finish that seeding and get that field in some\r\nsort of shape for mowing. I went to my next neighbor, who lives\r\nthere yet, and asked him what I had better use. I didn't know\r\nanything, practitically, about farming, and he advised me to try\r\nsome clover seed. He said: 'So far as I know, none was ever sown on\r\nthat farm. They have sowed timothy everlastingly, everybody, because\r\nit is cheap. I knew timothy wouldn't grow there to amount to\r\nanything If I were in your place I would try some clover.'\r\n\r\n\"I got the land prepared and sowed that clover alone, so as to give\r\nit a chance. I did have sense enough to mow off the weeds when they\r\ngot six or eight or ten inches high perhaps, so that the clover\r\ncould have a little better chance to grow. It happened to be a very\r\nwet season. I remember that distinctly. This was a lot near to the\r\nbarn. I suppose what little manure they had hauled out had been\r\nmostly put on this land. With these favoring conditions the result\r\nwas fairly good. Of course not half what we got later, but we got\r\nquite a little clover and when I came to mow it, and to mow that\r\ntimothy at the other end, I could see I could draw the rake two or\r\nthree times as far in the timothy as in the clover. There was more\r\nclover on an acre. A load of timothy would go in and a load of\r\nclover. When I fed it to the cows in winter I noticed when feeding\r\nclover for a number of days they gave more milk. I didn't know why.\r\nI don't know as anybody knew why then. There wasn't an experiment\r\nstation in the land. We were following our own notions. But the cows\r\ngave more milk; I could see that plainly.\r\n\r\n\"A little later I had an experiment forced on me by accident. I tell\r\nyou just how it came about. It resulted in putting a good many\r\nthousands in our pockets and I hope millions in the pockets of the\r\nfarmers of America. Later I wanted to plant corn on this field, and,\r\nas I wanted to grow just as good corn as I could, I got out what\r\nmanure we saved and put it on the land preparing for plowing. I knew\r\nthere wouldn't be more than half enough to go over the field. I said\r\nto myself, if there was any good corn, I would like it next to the\r\nroad where people would see it. Wouldn't any of you do it? I didn't\r\nhave a dollar to hire any help. I paid one dollar that year for\r\nhelp, and it was awful hard to get that dollar. I began spreading\r\nthat manure next to the road. The back half of the field was nearly\r\nout of sight. When I got half way back there wasn't any manure left\r\nand the back half didn't get any. Now it so happened that the\r\ntimothy was on the front end of the field, and it got the manure.\r\nThe clover on the back half didn't get any. It came about in the\r\nsimple way I told you of. Naturally I didn't expect much corn where\r\nI hadn't put any manure, but what was my surprise to find it was\r\njust about as good on that clover end of the field without any\r\ndressing as on the timothy end with what I had been able to put on.\r\nIt is only right I should say there wasn't much of the manure It was\r\npoor in quality because we couldn't get grain for the cows when we\r\ncouldn't get enough for ourselves to eat. There wasn't much manure\r\nand it was pretty poor, but such as it was that was the result. More\r\nhay to the acre, better hay, increased fertility, some way, by\r\ngrowing this clover!\r\n\r\n\"Now let us go back a little. I think it was the second spring after\r\nwe moved onto the place that I happened to be crossing the farm of\r\nmy next neighbor, Mr. Holcombe, now dead. I found him plowing. He\r\nhad been around a piece of land, I should judge five acres, half a\r\ndozen times. He was sitting on the plow, tired out,--too old to work\r\nanyway. He said, 'I wish you would take this land and put in some\r\ncrop on the shares; I want to get rid of the work; I can't do it,\r\nand would like to let you have it in some way. All I want is that it\r\nshould be left so I can seed it down in the fall again.'\r\n\r\n\"It was an old piece of sod he had mowed in the old eastern way\r\nuntil it wouldn't grow anything any longer. I don't suppose he got a\r\nquarter of a ton of hay to the acre. He wanted it plowed so he could\r\nre-seed it. I didn't know the value of the land, but, foolishly\r\nperhaps, as most people thought, offered him five dollars an acre\r\nfor the use of it. I hadn't enough to do at home. I didn't have my\r\nland in shape so I could do much. We were working along as fast as\r\nwe could. I thought I could do well if I had this job, and could\r\nperhaps make something off it. He agreed to it.\r\n\r\n\"I went home and got my team and plow, and finished the plowing. I\r\nremember making those furrows narrow and turning the ground well, a\r\nlittle deeper than it had been plowed before. I didn't realize what\r\nI was doing, then. I simply had been brought up to do my work well.\r\nI thought I was doing a good job, that was all. When I was through\r\nplowing I got my old harrow, a spike-tooth, and harrowed the ground.\r\nI had a roller. They were manufactured in our town. The firm bursted\r\nand I had a chance to buy one very cheap. I had a roller, harrow,\r\nand plow. That was all the tillage implements. The harrow had moved\r\nthe lumps around a little. I ran the roller over the lumps; then\r\nharrowed, rolled, and harrowed. When the harrow would not take hold,\r\nI put a plank across and rode on it. I worked that land alternately\r\nuntil I had the surface as fine and nice as I could make it, two or\r\nthree inches deep. The harrow would not take hold any longer and I\r\nhad to quit. By and by a rain came. I didn't know anything about how\r\nto till land,--this spring fallow business--but I happened to hit it\r\nright. After it rained, I said that harrow will take hold better\r\nnow. I loaded the harrow and got on it, and tore that ground up\r\nthree or four inches deep.\r\n\r\n\"The harrow teeth were sharp. I harrowed and rolled it and my\r\nneighbor said, 'Terry, you are ruining that land, it will never grow\r\nanything any more, it will all blow away.' I reminded him of his\r\nbargain; I should raise what I pleased and take the crop home. Every\r\nlittle while, I can't remember how often, I would go over and harrow\r\nand roll that land. I probably plowed it the first week in April.\r\nFor two months that was a sort of savings bank for my work. I would\r\nrun over and work that land, occasionally, until, about the first\r\nweek in June, I had it prepared just as mellow and fine and nice as\r\nit was possible to make it. It was nice enough for flower seeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I builded better then than I knew. I had no idea what the result\r\nwas going to be. When it was all ready, I sowed Hungarian grass\r\nseed. I wish you could have seen the crop. It grew four and a half\r\nor five feet high, as thick as it could stand on the land. I believe\r\nif I had thrown my straw hat, it would have staid on the top. It was\r\nenormous for that land. I had four big loads to the acre. You know\r\nwhat you can put on a load of Hungarian. When I went by the owner's\r\nhouse with those loads and took them to our barn, he was out there\r\nand he looked awfully sour. That man, to my knowledge, had never\r\ngrown half as much to the acre since I had known of his being on the\r\nland, probably never more than one-third as much. Old run-out\r\ntimothy sod; no manure, no fertilizer, nothing but the work,--this\r\nspring fallowing. I enjoyed the matter more, because he had told\r\nsome of the neighbors he had got the start of that town fellow; I\r\nwould never see five dollars an acre back, out of the land. That was\r\nhis opinion of what I could raise.\r\n\r\n\"Hay was hay that fall, after a dry season. We live in a dairy\r\nsection. The cows were there and had to be fed. I got $18 a ton for\r\nthat hay in our barn, something like $70 per acre. I think the laugh\r\nwas on the other side. That was my first awakening, along this line\r\nof tillage. Didn't know how it came about, didn't know anything\r\nabout the fertility locked up in the soil, just the plain facts. I\r\ndid so and so, and got such and such results. The next year Charlie\r\nHarlow, still living there, said, 'I wish you would put in some\r\nHungarian for me this spring.' I said, 'What part of the crop?--I\r\nshould want two-thirds.' He said he had an offer for half. I said,\r\n'Then let him have it.' He replied, 'One-third of what you will\r\nraise is more than half of what he will raise.' He saw what I did on\r\nhis brother-in-law's farm.\r\n\r\n\"The following year I had a piece of land ready to grow corn, I had\r\ncleared out the stumps and done the best I could to get it in shape.\r\nI plowed it just as soon as the ground was dry enough, about the\r\nfirst of April, that is. I worked it every little while just as\r\nnearly as I could as the Hungarian land had been worked, I harrowed\r\nand rolled, let it rest a while, then harrowed and rolled. I kept it\r\nup until my next door neighbor, Mr. Croy, had planted his corn, and\r\nit was four inches high and growing pretty well. Ours wasn't\r\nplanted. A neighbor came and said, 'I am sorry for you, Terry, you\r\ndon't know what you are about. You are fooling away your time. Your\r\ncorn ought to have been in before this.' I was harrowing and\r\nrolling. I was determined to see whether I could do it over again.\r\nSome of the neighbors said it couldn't be done again.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth or fifth of June--too late, ordinarily, to plant corn\r\nwith us--I put in the crop. I wish you could have seen it grow! It\r\ncame up and grew from the word 'Go.' In four weeks it was ahead of\r\nany corn about. It went ahead of my neighbor's corn that was three\r\nor four inches high when ours was planted. We had a crop that, the\r\nfarm in the condition that it was, was considered as something\r\nremarkable. They couldn't account for it, neither could I. All I\r\nknew was I had been working the ground so and so and getting such\r\nand such results.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go back once more. The first year that I moved onto that\r\nfarm, the first fall, we had nine cows, and I wanted to save all of\r\nthe manure. Now, there wasn't an experimental station in the land. I\r\ndidn't know anything about the potassium or nitrogen in the liquid\r\nmanure, but I had seen where it dropped on the land and how the\r\ngrass grew. I thought it was plant food, and our land was hungry. I\r\nsaid, I must try and save this manure, and not have it wasted. I\r\nhadn't a dollar. What did I do? There was an old stable there that\r\nwould hold ten cows. It was in terrible shape. It had a plank floor\r\nthat was all broken. I tore it out. I hauled some blue clay. I\r\nfilled the stable four or five inches deep with the blue clay, wet\r\nit, pounded it down, shaped it off and got it level, fixed it up\r\naround the sides, saucer shape, so it would hold water. Then I laid\r\ndown some old boards (I couldn't buy new ones), and put in a lot of\r\nstraw there and put my cows in. I saved all that manure the first\r\nyear, all that liquid. I had twice as much, probably more, from the\r\nsame number of cows as had been saved on that farm before, and it\r\nwas much more valuable. That was the beginning the first winter,\r\nwhen I hadn't anything.\r\n\r\n\"For the horse stable I went to town and found some old billboards.\r\nIt was new lumber, but had been used for billboards. After the\r\ncircus the owner offered to sell the boards cheap, and to trust me.\r\nHe was a carpenter, and he jointed them. We put them crosswise on\r\nthe old plank floor, and when they got wet they swelled and became\r\npractically water tight. I even crawled under and saw that there was\r\nno liquid manure dropping down there. I drew sawdust and used for\r\nbedding. I saved the liquid of the horse stable. I didn't know it\r\nwas worth three times as much, pound for pound, as the solid. I\r\ndidn't know it was worth two times as much in the cow stable, pound\r\nfor pound, as the solid. I found it out by experience.\r\n\r\n\"Now, when I was in town, before going on this farm, I worked for S.\r\nStraight & Son, the then great cheese and butter kings of the\r\nWestern Reserve. I was getting over a thousand dollars a year in\r\ntheir office. They didn't want me to leave at all, but my wife and I\r\ntook a notion to be independent, to work for ourselves, and we\r\nbought this old farm. We had a chance to work for ourselves, all\r\nright. The first year we worked from early in the morning until nine\r\nor ten o'clock at night, and then we tumbled into bed, too tired to\r\nthink, to get up and do it over again. I worked in the field, taking\r\nout stumps and doing something, as long as I could see, and then\r\nhelped my wife to milk. We would get our supper along about nine or\r\nten o'clock. At the end of the year we had not one single dollar,\r\nafter paying our interest and taxes,--not one dollar to show for our\r\nwork. Do you wonder we were pretty discouraged?\r\n\r\n\"I met Mr. Straight one day. He said: 'Terry, things are not going\r\nvery well in the office since you left. I wish you would come back.\r\nYou are not doing much over on that farm that I can see. You are\r\nhaving a hard time. I will gladly give you $1,200 a year if you will\r\ncome back into our office.' It was a great temptation. Think what it\r\nmeant. To move back to town and have $100 a month. But I said, 'No,\r\nMr. Straight; I can't do it.' I don't deserve any credit for it,\r\nfriends: but I wasn't built that way. I can't back out. When I\r\nundertake anything I have got to go through. I would have been\r\nwilling enough to leave that farm, if I had made a success of it,\r\nafter I made a success of it, as I thought then; but I wasn't\r\nwilling to give up, whipped--to acknowledge that I had undertaken\r\nthat job and had to back out and go back to town to make a living.\r\n\r\n\"Some little incident sometimes will change the whole character of a\r\nman's life. I remember, when we were in very hard conditions, we\r\nwere sitting under an apple tree in our door yard one evening. It is\r\nthere yet. Two men from town went by. One of them said to the other,\r\n'What is Terry going to do?' The other said, 'If Terry sticks to it\r\nhe will make something out of that old farm.' Just as quick as a\r\nflash, friends, I said, 'Terry will stick to it.'\r\n\r\n\"You see what condition we were in. I began to put all these matters\r\ntogether. I had been taught how to. In college I had been trained to\r\nstudy and think, of course,--not to work with my hands. When I got\r\nonto the work at first I worked myself almost to death with my\r\nhands, and had no time to think or study; but gradually old methods\r\ncame around again and I began to think and study. I said: 'Here,\r\nmore hay to the acre, better hay, increased fertility by growing\r\nthat clover, increased fertility by working that soil so much.' I\r\ndidn't know why, but there was the fact. 'Now, isn't it possible to\r\nput these matters together and so work them out as to build up the\r\nfertility of this farm and make it blossom like the rose?'\r\n\r\n\"I began to work it out. What was the first step? I sold eight or\r\nnine cows to get a little money to start, thus cutting off\r\npractically our whole source of income. There was no other way I\r\ncould get any money. We had to do some draining. A part of the land\r\nwe could not do anything with until it was tile-drained. It took\r\nmoney to buy tile. I had to have a little help about the digging,\r\nalthough I like to boast that I laid every tile on my farm with my\r\nown hands. I buried every one and know it will stay there. They were\r\nall sound and hard and good. In all these years not one has ever\r\nfailed, not one drain or tile. I worked day after day, in the rain,\r\nwet to the skin, because it had to be done. It was the foundation of\r\nour success.\r\n\r\n\"As I was coming here yesterday, and passed so much of your flat\r\nland, in need of drainage, I thought, drainage is the foundation of\r\nsuccess for lots of these people, down here in southern Illinois.\r\nYou can't do much until you have the water out of the land. Then you\r\nhave a chance to do something with tillage and manure-saving and\r\nclover. But you throw away your efforts when you try to do this work\r\non land that is in need of drainage.\r\n\r\n\"As fast as possible we fixed up this land. Of course, it took\r\nyears. We hadn't money, and there were many things that had to be\r\ndone,--changing fields, getting out stumps, doing drainage,--it all\r\ntook time. I had my plans made and was working as fast as I could.\r\n\r\n\"Two things I did, to keep life in our bodies until we got ready to\r\nmake some money. One was to cut off every bit of timber on the farm.\r\nOur neighbors laughed at us and prophesied rain and all that. There\r\nwere two things in my mind. We had to have money to live on, and I\r\nmanaged to get quite a little of it in that way. In the next place\r\nwe didn't have much of a farm, and I wanted the land for tillage. We\r\ncan buy wood of the neighbors to-day, cheaper than we sold ours, so\r\nwe never lost anything.\r\n\r\n\"Another way we got some money, as we went along, that helped us,\r\nwas raising forage crops. I did not attempt to put in crops that\r\nrequired much hand labor. I raised Hungarian, and everything I could\r\nto be fed to cows. In our dairying section, with feed often scarce\r\nin the fall, farmers often had more stock than they could winter. We\r\ncould pick up cows cheaply on credit and hold them. I could winter\r\nthem for people, and the manure we used as a top dressing, to make\r\nthe clover grow. Starting with a little piece of land, we spread out\r\nmore and more, and got more and more enriched, and more and more\r\ngrowing clover, and by and by we got all the cultivated land growing\r\nit. Then we were ready for business.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid to tell you Illinois farmers, with your great big\r\nfarms, how large our farm was. We bought one hundred and twenty-five\r\nacres. We sold off all but fifty-five. That didn't help us, for the\r\nman who bought it was so poor he didn't pay us for over thirty\r\nyears. Then the land went up in price and he was able to sell it for\r\na good price and we got our money. Fifty-five acres were selected,\r\nthe best we could for our purpose. Twenty acres were so situated as\r\nto have no value. Thirty-five acres were fairly good, tillable land,\r\nthe best we could pick out. I began a system of rotation, after we\r\ngot the land ready for it, of clover, potatoes, and wheat. My idea\r\nwas to have the clover gather fertility to grow potatoes and wheat.\r\nI was going to make use of the tillage to help out all I could, and\r\nsold the potatoes and wheat, and then had clover again, and so on\r\naround the circle. Everybody said, of course I would fail. I didn't\r\nknow but I would. It was the only chance and I had to take it.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it took quite a while to get this thing going. The first\r\nthree or four years didn't amount to much. After six or eight years\r\nwe were surprised at the result. We were getting more than we hoped\r\nfor. In a dozen years the whole country was surprised. I remember\r\nwhen a reporter was sent from Albany, New York, to see what we were\r\ndoing, and reported in the \"Country Gentlemen.\" We had visitors by\r\nthe score from various states, it made such a stir. They couldn't\r\nbelieve it was possible for a man to take land as poor as that, and\r\nmake it produce so well. We had some they could see that had not\r\nbeen touched. As I told you, in eleven years we were out of debt.\r\nAfter about ten or eleven years we were laying up a thousand dollars\r\na year, above all living and running expenses, from this land,\r\nraising potatoes and wheat. It doesn't seem possible to you, large\r\nfarmers, but you can't get around the facts. In 1883 we laid up\r\n$1,700 from the land. But this was a little extra.\r\n\r\n\"We wanted to build a new house. We had lived in the old shell long\r\nenough. We had the money to pay cash down for the new house and to\r\npay for the furniture that went into it. We paid $3,500 cash down,\r\nthat fall, for the house and furniture, and every dollar taken out\r\nof the land. Only two or three years before that we paid the last of\r\nour debt. I had not done any talking or writing to speak of, at that\r\ntime. I did not begin until 1882 I never went to an institute, and\r\nnever wrote an article for a paper, except when called upon to do\r\nit. I never sought such a job and prefer to stay at home on my farm.\r\nIt was only because I was called to do this work that I got into it.\r\nFor twenty-one years I was never at home one week during the winter\r\nseason. Farmers called for me and I didn't feel that I could refuse\r\nto go.\r\n\r\n\"Now, how did we do it? I told some of the things. Let us go down to\r\nthe science of the matter little, now. I didn't know anything about\r\nthe science at the time. That came later. Practice came first. We\r\nknow now--of course, you all know--that clover has the ability,\r\nthrough the little nodules that grow on the roots, to take the free\r\nnitrogen out of the air to grow itself. You know about four-fifths\r\nof the air you are breathing is nitrogen in the form of gas, and\r\nclover has the ability to feed on that and make use of it. The other\r\nplants have not. I might illustrate it in this way: You can't eat\r\ngrass; at least, you wouldn't do very well on it. But the steer eats\r\ngrass and you eat the steer, so you get the grass, don't you? Your\r\ncorn, wheat, oats, timothy, potatoes, so far as we know, can't touch\r\nfree nitrogen in the air, but clover can and then feed it to those\r\nother crops.\r\n\r\n\"Let us look into how we got the phosphorus. On land that would not\r\ngrow over six to eight bushels of wheat per acre we have succeeded\r\nonce in growing forty-seven and three-fourths bushels to the acre,\r\non all the land sowed, of wheat that sold away above the market\r\nprice and weighed sixty-four pounds to the measured bushel, and\r\nnever put on a pound of phosphorus. We got it from that tillage we\r\ntold you about. Our land in northeastern Ohio is not very good\r\nnaturally. It is nothing like what you have in this state. Most of\r\nyou know that is the poorest land we have in the state in general,\r\nbut we have a fair share of clay and sand in ours. That has helped\r\nus wonderfully. We have clay enough so that with our tillage we can\r\nmake so far all the plant food available we want.\r\n\r\n\"Now, a little more about the tillage. I told you how we worked the\r\nsurface of that ground and made it fine and nice. After five or six\r\nyears, perhaps, of this kind of work, I got to thinking if I had\r\nsome tool that would stir that ground to the bottom of the plowed\r\nfurrow and mix it very deeply and thoroughly, I might get still\r\nbetter results out of the tillage. I happened to be in town one\r\nmorning in the fall, when we had some wheat land (clover sod) plowed\r\nand prepared for wheat. I had harrowed and rolled it and made it as\r\nnice as I could.--It was what the neighbors would call all ready for\r\nsowing and more than ready. In town I saw a man trying to sell a\r\ntwo-horse cultivator. I think it was made in this State. It was the\r\nfirst one I ever saw--you can judge how long ago. It was a big,\r\nheavy, cumbersome thing,--a horse-killer. I thought, if I only had\r\nthat, I knew I could increase the fertility of our soil still more.\r\nI hadn't any money. We hadn't got far enough that there was a dollar\r\nto spare. What did I do? I gave my note for $50 and took that\r\ncultivator home with me. I could have bought it for $35 in money,\r\nbut I didn't have it. My wife didn't say a word when I got home. I\r\nhave heard since that she did a lot of crying to think I would go in\r\ndebt $50 more, and all for that thing.\r\n\r\n\"I got home about eleven o'clock and you can well suspect that I\r\ncouldn't eat any dinner that day. I hitched up and went right to\r\nwork, and told my wife I couldn't stop for any dinner. I rode that\r\ncultivator that day and tore up that field in a way land was never\r\ntorn up in our section before. There was nothing to do it with. The\r\nsoil would roll up and tumble over. After going lengthwise I went\r\ncrosswise. A thousand hogs couldn't have made it rougher. The\r\nneighbors looked on and said that 'Terry would do 'most anything if\r\nyou would only let him ride.' The worst of it was, I really didn't\r\nknow but what they were right, and all he would get out of it was\r\nthe riding. It was a serious thing. I had to wait until the harvest\r\ntime before I could know.\r\n\r\n\"What was the result? I got ten bushels of wheat more per acre than\r\nhad ever grown on the land before, without any manure or fertilizer\r\nhaving been applied since it grew the previous crop in the rotation.\r\nClover had been grown. It was a clover sod. I didn't know how much\r\ncame from the clover and how much from the tillage. I didn't care,\r\nthey went together to get that result. I asked some of the old\r\nsettlers how much had been grown there per acre during their\r\nrecollection. They said twenty-three bushels was the most they had\r\nknown. I got thirty-three. The neighbors said, 'It happened so, you\r\ncan't do it again.' You know how they talk, to make out nothing can\r\nbe done with an old farm. I was interested in doing it again. I paid\r\nthat note and had a large margin of profit left, you see, out of the\r\nextra wheat. It all came right.\r\n\r\n\"The next year I took the next field in rotation and worked it in\r\nthe same way, probably more. I got thirteen bushels more wheat per\r\nacre than ever grew before. Thirty-six bushels of wheat! Such a\r\nthing was never heard of in our section before; land that would not\r\ngrow anything a dozen years ago. Do you wonder I have been an\r\nenthusiast on tillage since then? Why, they call me a crank\r\nsometimes. It is a good crank, as it has turned out prosperity for\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"After a time I began to think, can't we carry this matter a little\r\nfurther? People generally don't cultivate their crops more than two\r\nor three times in a season. Can I cultivate more to advantage? I\r\nbegan to try it, six or eight times, eight or ten. I think there\r\nhave been dry years when I have cultivated our potatoes as many as\r\nfifteen times. I don't believe we ever went through them when it\r\ndidn't pay.\r\n\r\n\"I remember one fall, when it was a wet season. When the tops began\r\nto die and got to the point where I could see the space between the\r\nrows, I started the cultivators again. I had money then to hire men\r\nand I hired plenty of them. I started to cultivate between the rows.\r\nPeople said, ' What is the idiot doing now?' I said, 'He is going\r\nto raise five bushels more by doing that work, that it what he is\r\nafter.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, remember, more hay to the acre, better hay, increased\r\nfertility by growing clover, increased fertility by working this\r\nland over and over in the different ways I have told you of. They\r\nused to send for me to talk on this subject, before I knew anything\r\nabout it, except that I had done it. In Wisconsin, some twenty years\r\nago, I helped at the first institute held in the state. They sent\r\nfor me to come up. I told them what I was doing and how I thought it\r\ncame about, what I thought clover was doing for me. When I was\r\nthrough I asked Professor Henry, who was in the audience, to tell\r\nme, honestly, what he thought about my talk. He said, 'As a farmer I\r\nbelieve you are right, but as a scientific man I dare not say so in\r\npublic.'\r\n\r\n\"Professor Roberts came to my place one time, to investigate a\r\nlittle. I knew what he came for. I showed him around, and showed him\r\nthe land we had not touched, not to this day. He was a surprised\r\nman. I remember the second crop of clover was at its best. It was\r\nabove his knees. He says, 'This will make two tons of hay to the\r\nacre, and it is the second crop.' He didn't say but very little. I\r\ncouldn't get him to talk much. He went home and began that system of\r\nexperiments at Ithaca that has practically revolutionized the\r\nagriculture of the east--experiments in tillage. Pretty soon we had\r\nhis book on the fertility of the soil. I think he got his\r\ninspiration from what he saw. He said to himself, seems to me,\r\n'Terry has something that scientific men do not know.' He got\r\nsamples of soil all over the state. They analyzed the soil and found\r\nwhat the average soil of New York contained. They found about four\r\nthousand five hundred pounds of nitrogen, six thousand three hundred\r\npounds of phosphoric acid, and twenty-four thousand pounds of potash\r\nin an average acre eight inches deep; and they had been buying\r\npotash largely. (Laughter.)\r\n\r\n\"The farm we moved onto was the old Sanford homestead. Old Mr.\r\nSanford lived there and brought up a large family. I think five of\r\nthem boys. Every one of these boys left the farm just as soon as\r\nthey could get away. There wasn't anything in farming for them.\r\nAfter we had been at work a dozen years or more and got things going\r\nnicely, they came back (one of them lives in Connecticut) and\r\nvisited the old homestead. I remember Lorenzo said, 'It seems like a\r\nmiracle. I don't know how you did it. We worked from daylight to\r\ndark, from one year's end to another, and never had anything. We\r\nboys used to be promised a holiday on the Fourth of July if the corn\r\nwas all hoed. That was all we got. How on earth have you done these\r\nthings?'\r\n\r\n\"Friends, there were three farms we bought. Old Mr. Sanford didn't\r\nknow anything about but one. There was the air and the soil and\r\nthere was the subsoil. He had been working only the soil, plowing it\r\nthree or four inches deep, scratching it over, taking what came, and\r\nevery year less and less came. The land had run down until the\r\nsurface had quit producing. We took the same soil, put in clover and\r\ntook the fertility out of the upper farm, the air, and out of the\r\nlower one, the subsoil, and put it into the second one. We plowed\r\nthe surface soil a little deeper and deeper until we got it eight or\r\nnine inches deep instead of four. We worked it more and more,\r\nsetting more and more of the available plant food in the soil free.\r\nThat is how we did it.\r\n\r\n\"I say 'we' advisedly, because, friends, if I hadn't had a wife\r\nfully able and willing to do her part, and more, I would not have\r\nthis story to tell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nAN AWAKENING DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE chores are all done,\" said Mrs. Johnston, as Percy began to\r\ntake down his heavy work-coat about nine o'clock that evening.\r\n\r\n\"You ought not to have done them,\" he chided as he slipped his arm\r\naround her and drew her to the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about the Institute,\" she said, stroking the hair from his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nHe told her of the professors who were there from the University and\r\nbriefly reported the addresses he had heard.\r\n\r\n\"And I verily believe,\" he added, \"that if Terry were to wake up\r\nsome morning and find himself located on the \"Barrens\" of the\r\nHighland Rim of Tennessee, he would start out with the firm\r\nconviction that all he would need to do to become a successful\r\nfarmer there would be to sow clover and then 'work the land for all\r\nthat's in it.' But, after all, it is not so strange, perhaps, that\r\none who has himself discovered and then utilized the power of clover\r\nand tillage to restore and increase the productive power of land\r\nrich in limestone, phosphorus and all other essential mineral plant\r\nfood, should jump to the fixed and final conclusion that the same\r\nsystem of treatment is all that is needed to make any and all land\r\nproductive. The fact that Terry's land (if equal to the nearby New\r\nYork land) contained two thousand three hundred pounds of phosphorus\r\nin the plowed soil of an acre when he began to work it out, while\r\nthe soil of the Tennessee \"Barrens\" contains only about one\r\nhundred pounds, does not disturb him or modify his opinion so long\r\nas his personal experience is limited to his own land.\r\n\r\n\"Terry's problem was easier than Mr. West's on his Virginia farm,\r\nwhere the soil is acid and hence limestone must be used liberally in\r\norder that clover and other legumes may be grown successfully. Even\r\nthe supply of phosphorus and other mineral elements is probably\r\ngreater in Terry's farm in northeastern Ohio than in the soil of\r\nWestover.\r\n\r\n\"Our problem is even more difficult, because we must not only\r\nincrease the supply of active organic matter, although we have a\r\nreserve of old humus far above that contained in the Terry or West\r\nfarms; but in addition we need more limestone than Mr. West and then\r\nwe must add the phosphorus. Of course the surface washing is a\r\nserious factor on Westover, but perhaps our tight clay subsoil is\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n\"But I learned at least two things that I shall try to profit by.\r\nOne of these was from Governor Hoard's lecture on 'Cows Versus Cows,\r\nand the man behind the cow'; and the other is that we must do more\r\nwork on the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Percy, I am so sorry you went. How can you possibly do more\r\nwork than you have been doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I may need to hire more,\" he replied; \"and, of course, that will\r\nfurther increase our expenses, but, it will surely pay to do well\r\nwhat we try to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"When does my boy expect to get married?\" she asked, softly, as\r\nshe gently stroked his hair.\r\n\r\n\"I am married,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Mother mine, I thought that you knew I was married.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your face is blank sincerity, as usual,\" she said smiling, \"but you\r\nnever deceive me with your voice. Your voice reveals every attempt\r\nat deception. Tell me what you mean.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was sincere now. \"I am married to a farm and laboring\r\ntogether with God. After hearing Terry's talk, I am more than ever\r\ndetermined to continue to do my part, working in the light as He\r\ngives me the power to see the light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Percy, dear,\" she asked, \"did you know the bride whose wedding\r\ncards you received yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember what I told you of Adelaide West, Mr. West's\r\ndaughter?\" he queried.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said the mother. She stepped to Percy's home-made\r\ndesk, and from one of the pigeon holes, drew out a bunch of letters,\r\nand selected the top and bottom letters from the pile.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the first and last letters you have received from Mr.\r\nWest. Did you ever see this?\" She drew out a crumpled piece of\r\npaper and placed it in his hand.\r\n\r\n_\"Her Grandma had not consented,\"_ he read. \"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know and I did not know when I read it three years ago. It\r\ncame in your first letter from Mr. West. I thought you had not found\r\nit in the envelope, but you gave me the letter to read and I found\r\nit. I left it in the letter, but never till to-day did I feel that I\r\nought to mention it to you. Yesterday you received a letter with two\r\ncards; but you read only one of them to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I saw the other was only the wedding announcement, and I left\r\nthem both in the letter for you to read.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I read them both,\" she said. \"Read this.\"\r\n\r\nPercy took the card and slowly read:\r\n\r\n_Mr. and Mrs. Clarance Voit\r\n\r\nAnnounce the marriage of their daughter\r\n\r\nAmeila Louise\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nProfessor Paul Strongworth Barstow_\r\n\r\nShe watched his face but saw no sign. She kissed his forehead and\r\nthen pointed to the writing, _\"With Grandma's Compliments,\"_ saying,\r\n\"I do not know what this means, but I thought my boy might be\r\ngetting too careless, when he fails to read even the wedding\r\nannouncement of college professors, sent to him by such a good\r\nfriend as Grandma West may intend to be.\"\r\n\r\nPercy looked into his mother's face as if to read her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"I think I understand what you have in mind,\" he said. \"Mr. West has\r\nmentioned once or twice that Adelaide was teaching school, but I\r\nsupposed that she was trying to earn enough to buy her own wedding\r\noutfit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is true,\" replied the mother, \"and perhaps she is\r\nalready married or soon to be married; but I thought you ought to\r\nknow that she had not married Professor Barstow, lest you might\r\nallude to it in your letters to Mr. West.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nHONEY WITHOUT WAX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WELL, I reckon the cowboy's gone back to 'tend to his cows,\" remarked\r\nthe grandmother to Adelaide, as she returned from taking Percy to\r\nBlue Mound and found the old lady sitting on the lawn bench\r\napparently enjoying the mild late November weather. \"Did you leave\r\nhim at the station or see him off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" Adelaide replied, sitting down beside her. \"The train was\r\nlate, and he insisted on coming back with me to the first turn, and\r\nthen stood and watched till I came within sight of home at the next\r\nturn. I doubt if he is back to the station yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"He reminds me, Pet, of the Latin definition you gave for _sincere,\"\r\n_remarked the grandmother. \"Pure honey without wax, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Grandma. Not pure honey. It says nothing about honey. Sine\r\nis the Latin for _without, _and _cera _means _wax; _so that our word\r\n_sincere, _taken literally from the Latin, means _without wax.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I see now; but let me tell you, Adelaide, I think that\r\nprofessor of yours is right smart wax.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Grandma! I never heard you say such a thing. You know papa and\r\nmamma like Professor Barstow and I think I like him too, and,--and\r\nhe has papa's consent, and mamma's consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you never heard me say such a thing before and you won't ever\r\nhear it again, but he hasn't got my consent. I think he's some wax,\r\nbut I reckon you think he's some honey, and I know he thinks he's\r\nsome punk'ns. Of course, your father would like an English or\r\nScottish nobleman for a son-in-law, or at least a college professor\r\nwith a string of ancestry reaching across the water; but the Henry's\r\nprefer to make their own reputations as they go along, and I doubt\r\nif Patrick ever saw England or Scotland. I tell you, Adelaide, a\r\npound of gumption will make a better husband than a shipload of\r\nancestry, and I just hope you will more than like your husband,\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\nWith that the old lady arose and walked to the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nINSPIRATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTOVER,\r\n\r\nMarch 14, 1907.\r\n\r\nMr. Percy Johnston,\r\n\r\nHeart-of-Egypt, Ill.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR Friend:--We were delighted to receive your interesting\r\nletter of March 2, describing the Farmer's Institute. I have been to\r\ntwo such meetings in Virginia, but they are devoted to fruit and\r\ntruck and dairying, and no one seems to know much about our soils. I\r\nappreciate more and more every year the absolute knowledge you\r\nhelped me to secure concerning Westover, where we had been working\r\nin the dark for two centuries. I am sure you will succeed on\r\nPoorland Farm,--just as confident as any one can be in advance of\r\nactual achievement; and I expect to see the time when Richland Farm\r\nwill be a more appropriate name.\r\n\r\nI only wish you could see my alfalfa. I have been seeding more every\r\nyear and now have sixty acres. It has come through winter in fine\r\ncondition and it will be a fine sight by Easter. Here's a standing\r\ninvitation to take Easter dinner with us, or any other dinner, for\r\nthat matter, if you ever come East.\r\n\r\nI am planning to sow about forty acres more alfalfa this year. A\r\nwriter for the _Breeder's Gazette _visited us last summer, and he\r\nsaid some of our alfalfa was as good as any he had ever seen in\r\nCalifornia. He said ground limestone was plainly what we need for\r\nalfalfa at Westover, but he thought some phosphorus would also help\r\non the less rolling areas, where the alfalfa is not so good as where\r\nyou found more phosphorus.\r\n\r\nLime and raw rock phosphate make the difference between clover and\r\nno clover.\r\n\r\nI can get ground limestone for $2.90 a ton now, delivered at Blue\r\nMound in bulk in carload lots. We are hoping to get it still lower,\r\nand I think we will, for some of the big lime manufacturers, such as\r\nthe company at Riverton, are making plans to furnish ground\r\nlimestone; and the railroad companies are likely to make better\r\nrates, or the State will do so for them.\r\n\r\nIt is truly a lamentable situation, when our hills and mountains are\r\nfull of all sorts of limestone, and our exhausted lands are crying\r\nfor that more than anything else. We understand, even better than\r\nyou, that everybody is poor in a country where the land is poor; and\r\nit should be to the greatest interest of the railroad companies as\r\nwell as to all other industries, to unite in an effort to make it\r\npossible for every landowner to apply large amounts of limestone to\r\nhis land,--the more the better,--and no one should expect any large\r\nprofit from the business; but wait till the benefit is produced on\r\nthe land,--wait till the farmer has his increased crops, and some\r\nmoney from the sale of those crops. Then the railroads can make\r\nprofit hauling those crops to market and hauling back the necessary\r\nsupplies, and even the luxuries, which the farmer's money will\r\nenable him to buy and pay for. Then the factory wheels will turn;\r\nfor, as you told us, the Secretary of Agriculture reports that\r\neighty-six per cent. of all the manufactured products are made from\r\nagricultural raw materials.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger but what the railroads and manufacturers and\r\ncommercial people will get their share out of the produce from the\r\nfarms; but it is absolutely sure that, when the farms fail to\r\nproduce, then there is no profit for any of them, and the last man\r\nto starve out will be the farmer himself, for he can live on what he\r\nraises even though he has nothing left to sell.\r\n\r\nWe are all well. My son Charles is still bookkeeping for a Richmond\r\nfirm, but he is becoming greatly interested in my alfalfa, and says\r\nhe sometimes wishes he had taken an agricultural course instead of\r\nthe literary at college. His grandmother says she reckons the\r\nagricultural college could give him about all the literature he\r\nneeds keeping books for a hides and tallow wholesale company; and I\r\nam coming to believe that she is about right. I still remember that\r\nthe dative of indirect object is used with most Latin verbs\r\ncompounded with _ad, ante, con, in, inter, ob, post, pre, pro, sub,\r\n_and _super, _and sometimes _circum; _but it would have been just as\r\neasy for me to have learned forty years ago that the essential\r\nelements of plant food are carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen; nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus, and potassium; magnesium, calcium, iron and sulfur; and\r\npossibly chlorin; and I am sure that the culture of Greek roots and\r\na knowledge of Latin compounds have been of less value to me during\r\nthe forty years than the culture of alfalfa roots and even a meager\r\nknowledge of plant-food compounds have been during the last three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAdelaide is teaching; Frank is in the academy; and the younger\r\nchildren are all in school.\r\n\r\nWe shall always be glad to hear from you.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully yours,\r\n\r\nCHARLES WEST.\r\n\r\n\"That is an exceptionally good letter,\" said Mrs. Johnson, as Percy\r\nfinished reading.\r\n\r\n\"Not for Mr. West,\" he replied. \"His letters are always good, always\r\nhelpful and encouraging, almost an inspiration to me. Mr. West is in\r\nmany ways a very exceptional man. If he had not been tied down all\r\nhis life to a so-called worn-out farm of a thousand acres, he might\r\njust as well have been the Governor of the State. Even in spite of\r\nhimself he has been practically forced to accept some very\r\nresponsible public offices, but the financial sacrifice was too\r\ngreat to permit his retaining them very long. I never realized until\r\nI was nearly through college that the trustees of our own University\r\ndevoted a large amount of time to that public service with no\r\nfinancial remuneration whatever. They are merely reimbursed for\r\ntheir actual and necessary travelling expenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I were a young man about your age, this letter would be an\r\ninspiration to me,\" said his mother.\r\n\r\n\"You mean his suggestion about changing the name of our farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I mean his possible suggestion about changing the name of his\r\ndaughter.\"\r\n\r\nPercy was silent.\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell anything from your blank face? Why do you not\r\nspeak?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have to show me,\" said Percy.\r\n\r\n\"Will you accept his invitation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. West always closes his letters with an invitation for me to\r\nvisit them if I ever come East. There is nothing exceptional or\r\nunusual in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter is very exceptional,\" she repeated, \"insomuch that if\r\nthere is no understanding there is no misunderstanding, and if there\r\nis some misunderstanding there was no intention. When Mrs. Barton\r\nsays: 'Do come over when you can,' there is no invitation intended\r\nand no acceptance expected; but when Mrs. McKnight says: 'Can't you\r\nand your son come over and take supper with us Thursday\r\nevening,'--well that is an invitation to come. In the case of Mr.\r\nWest's letter, perhaps you had an invitation to spend the Easter\r\nvacation at Westover when his daughter will be at home,--and perhaps\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nPercy was silent and his mother quietly waited.\r\n\r\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"I cannot afford to go this spring. We never\r\nwere so short of funds. I almost begrudged the railroad fare I paid\r\nto go to the Institute.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have agreed to agree with you regarding the matter of hiring more\r\nhelp on the farm if you need it,\" she said; \"for it is easily\r\npossible to lose by saving. There are some things which should never\r\nbe influenced by financial considerations. It is more than three\r\nyears since your Eastern trip. You need a rest and a change. It\r\nwould be entirely commonplace for you to spend the Easter time in\r\nVirginia. You ought to see the country in the spring; and you ought\r\nespecially to be interested in Mr. West's sixty acres of alfalfa.\r\nExpectations are always followed either by realization or by\r\ndisappointment, either of which my noble son can bear.\"\r\n\r\nHer fingers passed through his hair as she kissed his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"The only question is, whether you would enjoy a visit to Westover,\"\r\nshe continued. \"You have insisted that the Winterbine deposit\r\nremain in my name, but I have written and signed a check against\r\nthat reserve for $100, and you have only to fill in the date and\r\ndraw the amount at the County Seat whenever you wish. If you go,\r\nexpress my regards to the ladies, and especially remember me to the\r\ngrandmother.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE KINDERGARTEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEART-OF-EGYPT, ILLINOIS,\r\n\r\nNovember 9, 1909.\r\n\r\nHon. James J. Hill,\r\n\r\nGreat Northern Railroad Company, St. Paul, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR:--I have read with very great interest your article in\r\nthe November _World's Work _on \"What We Must Do to be Fed.\" I wonder\r\nif you read _The American Farm Review!_ In the editorial columns of\r\nthat journal, issue of October 28, 1909, occurs the following:\r\n\r\n\"The pessimist always assumes that every man who quits farming for\r\nsome other business does so because there is something the matter\r\nwith the farm. Mr. James J. Hill has recently considered the\r\nquestion and decided that, unless the farmer and his family can be\r\nconfined on the land and be compelled to do better work than they\r\nhave been doing, the balance of the population must starve to death.\r\nThe bug-aboo of impending decadence raised by such talk is based\r\nupon a wrong assumption, inadequate statistics, and a failure to\r\ncomprehend the evolutional movement in agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nThe evolutional movement means, of course, that we are different\r\nfrom other people. Have not England, Germany and France run their\r\nlands down until they produce only fourteen bushels of wheat per\r\nacre and have we not steadily built ours up to an average yield of\r\nthirty bushels? Other peoples wear out their soil because they fail\r\nto have part in the evolutional movement; whereas, did we not come\r\nto America and at once begin to make our rich land richer than it\r\never was in the virgin state? Do you not know, Sir, that the oldest\r\nlands in America are now the richest, most productive, and most\r\nvaluable? We admit, of course, that the Bureau of Soils of the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture reports the common level\r\nupland loam soil of St. Mary country, Maryland, to be valued at $1\r\nto $3 an acre, and the same kind of land in Prince George county,\r\nadjoining the District of Columbia, to be worth $1.50 to $5; but do\r\nyou not know the American evolutional movement could easily move all\r\nthose decimal points two places and at once make those values read\r\nfrom $100 to $500 an acre. And likewise, it would be a very simple\r\nmatter to change the yield of corn in Georgia from eleven bushels\r\nper acre and have it read one hundred and ten bushels. Why not, if\r\nan acre of corn in the adjoining State of South Carolina has\r\nproduced two hundred and thirty-nine bushels in one season? Do you\r\nnot see that this simple evolution would also put plate glass in the\r\nthousands of windowless homes now inhabited by human beings, both\r\nwhite and colored, in the state of Georgia?\r\n\r\nThere is another phase of this evolutional movement which should not\r\nbe overlooked. There is already fast developing in this country a\r\nclass of people who can live and grow fat on hot air, and they will\r\ntell you that your only trouble is poor digestion, and they are glad\r\nthat they can see the bright side of things and enjoy life in this\r\nglorious country, assured that the future will take care of itself.\r\nHave not all other great agricultural countries rapidly gotten into\r\nthis evolutional movement until all their people live on Easy\r\nStreet?\r\n\r\nI have a letter from a missionary in China, a former schoolmate,\r\nClarence Robertson, who resigned the position of Assistant Professor\r\nof mechanical engineering in Purdue University in order to accept in\r\nthe largest sense the Master's specific invitation to \"Go ye,\r\ntherefore, and teach all nations.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was written in February, 1907 and contained the\r\nfollowing statement regarding the famine district in which the\r\nwriter was located:\r\n\r\n\"At the present time the only practical thing to do is to let four\r\nhundred thousand people starve, and try to get seed grain for the\r\nremainder to plant their spring crops.\"\r\n\r\nI think we have failed utterly, Mr. Hill, to lay special emphasis\r\nupon either the evolutional or the emotional in agriculture. Is it\r\nnot probable that a superabundance of emotion would even permit the\r\nconstitution to wave the bread requirement in the\r\nbread-and-water-with-love diet? As a cure for pessimism the\r\nemotional tonic is strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some people who are even too emotional,\r\npeople who are inclined to sit up and take notice when the\r\nmathematics and statistics are spread out in clear light and plainly\r\nreveal the fact that the time is near at hand when their children\r\nmay lack for bread. (They already lack for meat and milk and eggs in\r\nmany places). To ally any feeling of this sort that might tend to\r\nexcite those who are so emotional as even to love their own\r\ngrandchildren, some sort of soothing syrup should be administered. A\r\npreparation put out by the Chief of the United States Bureau of\r\nSoils and fully endorsed by the great optimist, the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture, is recommended as an article very much superior to Mrs.\r\nWinslow's. As a moderate dose for an adult, read the following\r\nextracts from pages 66, 78, and 80 of Bureau of Soils Bulletin 55\r\n(1909), by the Chief of the Bureau:\r\n\r\n\"The soil is the one indestructible, immutable asset that the nation\r\npossesses. It is the one resource that cannot be exhausted; that\r\ncannot be used up.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the modern conception of the nature and purpose of the soil it\r\nis evident that it cannot wear out, that so far as the mineral food\r\nis concerned it will continue automatically to supply adequate\r\nquantities of the mineral plant foods for crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"As we see it now, the main cause of infertile soils or the\r\ndeterioration of soils is the improper sanitary conditions\r\noriginally present in the soil or arising from our injudicious\r\nculture and rotation of crops. It is, of course, exceedingly\r\ndifficult to work out the principles which govern the proper\r\nrotation for any particular soil.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a national asset the soil is safe as a means of feeding mankind\r\nfor untold ages to come. So far as our investigations show, the soil\r\nwill not be exhausted of any one or all of its mineral plant food\r\nconstituents. If the coal and iron give out, as it is predicted they\r\nwill before long, the soil can be depended on to furnish food,\r\nlight, heat, and habitation not only for the present population but\r\nfor an enormously larger population than the world has at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Personally, I take a most hopeful view of the situation as respects\r\nthe soil resources of our country and of the world at large. I\r\ncannot bring myself to believe that the discouraging reports that\r\nhave been issued from time to time as to the threatened\r\ndeterioration of our soils, as to the exhaustion of any particular\r\nelement of fertility, will ever be realized.\"\r\n\r\nSweeten to taste, and repeat the dose if necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you desire mathematical proof that we can always continue to take\r\ndefinite and measurable amounts of plant food away from the limited\r\nsupplies still remaining in our American soils and still have enough\r\nleft to supply the needs of all future crops, let it be understood:\r\n\r\nThat y = x\r\n\r\nThen xy = X3\r\n\r\nAnd xy-y2 = x3-y2\r\n\r\nOr y(x-y)=(x + y) (x-y)\r\n\r\nHence, y = x + y\r\n\r\nThus, y = 2y\r\n\r\nTherefore, 1=2\r\n\r\nNow cube both sides of the last equation and:\r\n\r\n1=8\r\n\r\nMultiply by one hundred and sixty, the number of pounds of\r\nphosphorus still remaining in the common upland soil of Southern\r\nMaryland, and behold:\r\n\r\n160 =1280\r\n\r\nThus the soil again becomes the equal of the $200 corn belt\r\nland,--Q. E. D.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Mr. Hill, you have not found it \"exceedingly difficult\r\nto work out the principles which govern the proper rotation\" that\r\n\"actually enriches the land.\"\r\n\r\nSeriously, I hope you will permit me to take this opportunity to say\r\nthat I deplore, as must all right-minded and clear-thinking men, the\r\noccasional petty criticisms which attribute to you some selfish\r\nmotive for the honest and noble stand you have taken concerning the\r\nimportance of immediate action and of a widespread, far-reaching,\r\nand generally effective movement looking toward, not the\r\nconservation, but the restoration, and permanent preservation of\r\nAmerican soils. According to the Scriptures, there is a sin which\r\nGod, Himself, will not forgive; namely, the sin of imputing bad\r\nmotives to the one who does right from motives only good and pure.\r\n\r\nThoughts that deserve a place of honor in American history you have\r\nexpressed in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"The farm is the basis of all industry, but for many years this\r\ncountry has made the mistake of unduly assisting manufacture,\r\ncommerce, and other activities that center in cities, at the expense\r\nof the farm. The result is a neglected system of agriculture and the\r\ndecline of the farming interest. But all these other activities are\r\nfounded upon the agricultural growth of the nation and must continue\r\nto depend upon it. Every manufacturer, every merchant, every\r\nbusiness man, and every good citizen is deeply interested in\r\nmaintaining the growth and development of our agricultural\r\nresources. Herein lies the true secret of our anxious interest in\r\nagricultural methods; because, in the long run, they mean life or\r\ndeath to future millions; who are no strangers or invaders, but our\r\nown children's children, and who will pass judgment upon us\r\naccording to what we have made of the world in which their lot is to\r\nbe cast.\"\r\n\r\nTrue and noble thoughts are these, from the master mind of a great\r\nstatesman; for there are statesmen who neither grace nor disgrace\r\nthe Halls of Congress.\r\n\r\nYour article contains twenty-eight pages of wholesome reading matter\r\nand instructive illustrations, and, in addition, about one page, I\r\nregret to say, of misinformation that will do much to destroy your\r\notherwise valuable contribution to agricultural literature.\r\n\r\nBriefly you have shown very clearly and very correctly that the\r\npresent practice of agriculture in America tends toward land ruin,\r\nand that, with our rapidly increasing population, with continued\r\ndepletion of our vast areas of cultivated soils, and with no\r\npossibility of any large extension of well-watered arable lands, we\r\nare already facing the serious problem of providing sufficient food\r\nfor our own people.\r\n\r\nYou summarize your conclusions along this line in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"We have to provide for a contingency not distant from us by nearly\r\na generation, but already present. The food condition presses upon\r\nus now. The shortage has begun. Witness the great fall in wheat\r\nexports and the rise of prices. Obviously it is time to quit\r\nspeculating about what may occur even twenty or thirty years hence,\r\nand begin to take thought for the morrow. As far as our food supply\r\nis concerned, right now the lean years have begun.\"\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the time is near when our food supplies shall\r\nbecome inadequate if our present practices continue, but the\r\nenforced reduction in animal products will at least postpone the\r\ntime of actual famine in America. I keep in mind always that we are\r\nfeeding much grain to domestic animals, an extremely wasteful\r\npractice so far as economy of human food is concerned; because, as\r\nan average, animals return in meat and milk not more than onefifth\r\nas much food value as they destroy in the corresponding grain\r\nconsumed; and, as we gradually reduce the amounts of grain that are\r\nfed to cattle, sheep, and swine, we shall also gradually increase\r\nour human food supply. Ultimately our milk-producing and\r\nmeat-producing animals will be fed only the grass grown upon the\r\nnon-arable lands and possibly some refuse forage not suitable for\r\nhuman food or more valuable for green manure, unless we modify our\r\npresent practice and tendency, which we can do if the proper\r\ninfluences are exerted by the intelligent people of this country,\r\nand thus make possible the continuation of high standards of living\r\nfor all our people.\r\n\r\nI keep in mind, too, that much of the food taken into the average\r\nAmerican kitchen is wasted, and that progress in the science of\r\nfeeding the man will ultimately prevent this waste and, by adding to\r\nthis better preparation and combination of foods, will increase to\r\nsome extent the nutritive value of our present food supply.\r\n\r\nThe serious fact remains, however, that our older lands are\r\ndecreasing in productive power and, in spite of what may be\r\naccomplished by such methods of conservation, we are now facing a\r\nrapidly approaching shortage of food supplies for the rapidly\r\nincreasing population of these United States; and you have put me\r\nand all other American citizens under lasting obligations to you for\r\nyour frankness, good sense, and true patriotism in thus pointing out\r\nn advance our great national weakness.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statistics of the United States Government, a\r\ncomparison of the last five years reported in this century with the\r\nlast five years of the old century, shows, by these two five-year\r\naverages, that our annual production of wheat has increased from\r\nabout five hundred million to seven hundred million bushels: that\r\nour annual production of corn has increased from two and one-quarter\r\nbillion to two and three-quarter billion bushels; that our wheat\r\nexports have decreased from thirty-seven per cent. to seventeen per\r\ncent. of our total production; that our corn exports have decreased\r\nfrom nine per cent. to three per cent. of our total production; and\r\nyet the average price of wheat, by the five-year periods, has\r\nincreased thirty-one per cent., and the average price of corn has\r\nincreased ninety-one per cent., during the same period.\r\n\r\nThe latest Year Book of the Department of Agriculture (1908 )\r\nfurnishes the average yields of wheat and corn for four successive\r\nten-year periods, from 1866 to 1905. By combining these into two\r\ntwenty-year periods this record of forty years shows that the\r\naverage yield of wheat for the United States increased one bushel\r\nper acre, while the average yield of corn decreased one and one-half\r\nbushels per acre, according to these two twenty-year averages.\r\n\r\nIf we consider only the statistics for the North-Central states,\r\nextending from Ohio to Kansas and from \"Egypt\" to Canada, the same\r\nforty-year record shows the average yield of wheat to have increased\r\none-half bushel per acre, while the average yield of corn decreased\r\ntwo bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThus, notwithstanding the great areas of rich virgin soils brought\r\nunder cultivation in the West and Northwest during the last forty\r\nyears, notwithstanding the abandonment of great areas of wornout\r\nlands in the East and Southeast during the same years,\r\nnotwithstanding the enormous extension of dredge ditching and tile\r\ndrainage, and, notwithstanding the marked improvement in seed and in\r\nthe implements of cultivation, the average yield per acre of the two\r\ngreat grain crops of the United States has not even been maintained,\r\nthe decrease in corn being greater than the increase in wheat, and\r\nnot only for the entire United States, but also for the great new\r\nstates of the corn belt and wheat belt.\r\n\r\n( Seasonal variations are so great that shorter periods than\r\ntwenty-year averages cannot be considered trustworthy for yield per\r\nacre.)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the total population of the United States increased from\r\nthirty-eight millions in 1870 to seventy-six millions in 1900, or an\r\nincrease of one hundred per cent. in thirty years; and the only\r\nmeans by which we have been able to feed this increase in population\r\nhas been by increasing our acreage of cultivated crops and by\r\ndecreasing our exportation of foodstuffs; and I need not remind you\r\nthat the limit to our relief is near in both of these directions.\r\nBut have we decreased our exportation of phosphate? Oh, no. On the\r\ncontrary, under the soothing influence of the most pleasing and\r\nacceptable doctrine that our soil is an indestructible, immutable\r\nasset, which cannot be depleted, our exportation of rock phosphate\r\nhas increased during the years of the present century from six\r\nhundred and ninety thousand tons in 1900, to one-million three\r\nhundred and thirty thousand tons in 1908, an increase of practically\r\none hundred per cent., in accordance with the published reports of\r\nthe United States Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nBut I am writing to you, Mr. Hill, not only to thank you for what\r\nyou have said and shown in the twenty-eight pages above referred to,\r\nbut also in part to repay my obligation to you by giving you some\r\ncorrect information, which I am altogether confident you will\r\nappreciate; namely, that, while you are a graduate student or past\r\nmaster in your knowledge of the supply and demand of the world's\r\nmarkets, you are just entering the kindergarten class in the study\r\nof soil fertility, as witness the following extracts from the one\r\nerroneous page of your article.\r\n\r\n\"Right methods of farming, without which no agricultural country\r\nsuch as this can hope to remain prosperous, or even to escape\r\neventual poverty, are not complicated and are within the reach of\r\nthe most modest means. They include a study of soils and seeds, so\r\nas to adapt the one to the other; a diversification of industry,\r\nincluding the cultivation of different crops and the raising of live\r\nstock; a careful rotation of crops, so that the land will not be\r\nworn out by successive years of single cropping; intelligent\r\nfertilizing by the system of rotation, by cultivating leguminous\r\nplants, and, above all, by the economy and use of every particle of\r\nfertilizing material from stock barns and yards; a careful selection\r\nof grain used for seed; and, first of all perhaps in importance, the\r\nsubstitution of the small farm, thoroughly tilled, for the large\r\nfarm, with its weeds, its neglected corners, its abused soil, and\r\nits thin product. This will make room for the new population whose\r\nadded product will help to restore our place as an exporter of\r\nfoodstuffs. Let us set these simple principles of the new method out\r\nagain in order:\r\n\r\n_\"First--_The farmer must cultivate no more land than he can till\r\nthoroughly. With less labor he will get more results. Official\r\nstatistics show that the net profit from one crop of twenty bushels\r\nof wheat to the acre is as great as that from two of sixteen, after\r\noriginal cost of production has been paid.\r\n\r\n_\"Second--_There must be rotation of crops. Ten years of single\r\ncropping will pretty nearly wear out any but the richest soil. A\r\nproper three or fiveyear rotation of crops actually enriches the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_\"Third--_There must be soil renovation by fertilizing; and the best\r\nfertilizer is that provided by nature herself--barnyard manure.\r\nEvery farmer can and should keep some cattle, sheep, and hogs on his\r\nplace. The farmer and his land cannot prosper until stock raising\r\nbecomes an inseparable part of agriculture. Of all forage fed to\r\nlive stock at least one-third in cash value remains on the land in\r\nthe form of manure that soon restores worn-out soil to fertility and\r\nkeeps good land from deteriorating. By this system the farm may be\r\nmade and kept a source of perpetual wealth.\"\r\n\r\nYour _first principle _will be agreed to and emphasized by all; but\r\nit should be kept in mind that the large farms are frequently better\r\ntilled than the small farms. The $200 land in the corn belt is\r\nusually \"worked for all that's in it.\" It is tile-drained and well\r\ncultivated, and the best of seed is used. If more thorough tillage\r\nwould increase the profits, these corn-belt farmers would certainly\r\npractice it.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be known (1) that as an average of six years the\r\nIllinois Experiment Station produced seventy and three-tenths\r\nbushels of corn per acre with the ordinary four cultivation, and\r\nonly seventy-two and eight-tenths bushels with additional\r\ncultivation even up to eight times; and (2) that the average yield\r\nof corn in India on irrigated land varies from seven bushels in poor\r\nyears to twelve bushels in good seasons, and this is where the\r\naverage farm is about three acres in size.\r\n\r\nOne Illinois farmer with a four-horse team raises more corn than ten\r\nGeorgia farmers with a mule a piece on the same total acreage\r\nFertile soil and competent labor are the great essentials in crop\r\nproduction. A mere increase in country population does not increase\r\nthe productive power of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe farms down here in \"Egypt\" average much smaller than those in\r\nthe corn belt of Illinois, but our \"Egyptian\" farms are nevertheless\r\npoorly tilled as a rule and some of them are already becoming\r\nabandoned for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nCertainly the land should always be well tilled, but tillage makes\r\nthe soil poorer, not richer. Tillage liberates plant food but adds\r\nnone. \"A little farm well tilled\" is all right if well manured, but\r\nit should not be forgotten that the men who consider \"Ten Acres\r\nEnough\" are market gardeners, or truck farmers, who are not\r\nsatisfied until in the course of six or eight years they have\r\napplied to their land about two hundred tons of manure per acre, all\r\nmade from crops grown on other lands.\r\n\r\nAll the manure produced in all the states would provide only thirty\r\ntons per acre for the farm lands of Illinois. In round numbers there\r\nare eighty million cattle and horses in the United States, and our\r\nannual corn crop is harvested from one hundred million acres. All\r\nthe manure produced by all domestic animals would barely fertilize\r\nthe corn lands with ten tons per acre if none whatever were lost or\r\nwasted; and, if all farm animals were figured on the basis of\r\ncattle, there is only one head for each ten acres of farm land in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nYour _second principle _is, that \"a proper three or five-year\r\nrotation of crops actually enriches the land.\"\r\n\r\nI hope the God of truth and a long-suffering, misguided people will\r\nforgive you for that false teaching. If there is any one practice\r\nthe value of which is fully understood by the farmers and landowners\r\nin the Eastern states and in all old agricultural countries, it is\r\nthe practice of crop rotation. Indeed, the rotation of crops is much\r\nmore common and much better understood and much more fully\r\nappreciated in the East than it is in the corn belt. Practically all\r\nwe know of crop rotation we have learned from the East. Every old\r\ndepleted agricultural country has worn out the soil by good systems\r\nof crop rotation. I once took a legal option of an \"abandoned\" farm\r\nin Maryland (beautiful location, two miles from a railroad station,\r\ngently undulating upland loam, at $10 per acre) that had been worn\r\nout under a four-year rotation of corn, wheat, meadow and pasture. A\r\nfew acres of tobacco were usually grown in one corner of the corn\r\nfield, and clover and timothy were regularly used for meadow and\r\npasture. Wheat, tobacco and livestock were sold, and manure was\r\napplied for tobacco and so far as possible for corn also. In the\r\nlater years of the system the ordinary commercial fertilizer was\r\nalso applied for the wheat at the usual rate of two hundred pounds\r\nper acre, this having become a \"necessity\" toward the end of this\r\nslow but sure system of land ruin.\r\n\r\nThe \"simple principles\" of your \"new method\" were understood and\r\npracticed in Roman agriculture two thousand years ago; and they\r\nincluded not only thorough tillage, careful seed selection, regular\r\ncrop rotation, and the use of farm manure, but also the use of green\r\nmanures. Thus Cato wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Take care to have your wheat weeded twice--with the hoe, and also\r\nby hand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again Cato wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Wherein does a good system of agriculture consist? In the first\r\nplace, in thorough plowing; in the second place, in thorough\r\nplowing; and, in the third place, in manuring.\"\r\n\r\nVarro, who lived at the same time as Cato, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The land must rest every second year, or be sown with lighter kinds\r\nof seeds, which prove less exhausting to the soil. A field is not\r\nsown entirely for the crop which is to be obtained the same year,\r\nbut partly for the effect to be produced in the following; because\r\nthere are many plants which, when cut down and left on the land,\r\nimprove the soil. Thus lupines, for instance, are plowed into a poor\r\nsoil in lieu of manure. Horse manure is about the best suited for\r\nmeadow land, and so in general is that of beasts of burden fed on\r\nbarley; for manure made from this cereal makes the grass grow\r\nluxuriantly.\"\r\n\r\nVirgil wrote in his _Georgics:_\r\n\r\n\"Still will the seeds, tho chosen with toilsome pains, Degenerate,\r\nif man's industrious hand Cull not each year the largest and the\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in 1859 that Baron von Liebig wrote as follows, regarding\r\nthese and similar _ancient _teachings:\r\n\r\n\"All these rules had, as history tells us, only a temporary effect;\r\nthey hastened the decay of Roman agriculture; and the farmer\r\nultimately found that he had exhausted all his expedients to keep\r\nhis fields fruitful and reap remunerative crops from them. Even in\r\nColumella's time, the produce of the land was only fourfold. It is\r\nnot the land itself that constitutes the farmer's wealth, but it is\r\nin the constituents of the soil, which serve for the nutrition of\r\nplants, that this wealth truly consists.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose, Mr. Hill, that a successful American farmer should tell you\r\nthat your bank account will actually increase if you will give from\r\nthree to five members of your family the privilege of writing checks\r\ninstead of following the single checking system. \"But,\" you will\r\nask, \"doesn't rotation produce a larger aggregate yield of crops\r\nthan the single crop system?\" Certainly, and, likewise, a rotation\r\nof the check book will produce a larger aggregate of the checks\r\nwritten; but the ultimate effect on the bank deposit is the same as\r\non the natural deposit of plant food in the soil, and finally the\r\nchecks will not be honored. Indeed, it would be a fine sort of\r\nperpetual motion if we could actually enrich the soil by the simple\r\nrotation of crops, and thus make something out of nothing.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, the common three-year rotation, corn, wheat,\r\nand clover. A fifty-bushel crop of corn removes twelve pounds of\r\nphosphorus from the soil; the twenty-five bushel wheat crop draws\r\nout eight pounds; and then the two-ton crop of clover withdraws ten\r\npounds, making thirty pounds required for this simple rotation. The\r\nmost common type of land in St. Mary county, Maryland, after two\r\nhundred years of farming, contains phosphorus enough in the soil for\r\nfive rotations of this simple sort. Mathematically that is all the\r\nfurther traffic in rotations that soil can bear. Agriculturally that\r\nsoil has refused to bear any sort of traffic, whether single or in\r\nrotations, and has been abandoned for farm use except where\r\nfertilized.\r\n\r\nThese crops would remove from the soil one hundred and twenty-four\r\npounds of nitrogen in the corn and wheat, and the roots and stubble\r\nof the clover would contain forty pounds of nitrogen. Now, if the\r\nsoil furnishes seventy-six pounds of nitrogen to the corn crop and\r\nforty-eight pounds to the wheat crop, will it furnish forty pounds\r\nto the clover crop, or as much as remains in the roots and stubble?\r\nIf so, how does the rotation actually enrich the soil in nitrogen?\r\n\r\nYou will be interested to know that there are many exact records of\r\nthe effect upon the soil of the rotation of crops. This particular\r\nthree-year rotation has been followed at the Ohio Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station for thirteen years, and the average yield of\r\nwheat has been, not twenty bushels, not sixteen bushels, but eleven\r\nbushels per acre, where no plant food was applied; although where\r\nfarm manure was used the wheat yielded twenty bushels, and with\r\nmanure and fine-ground natural rock phosphate added the average\r\nyield of wheat for the thirteen years has been more than twenty-six\r\nbushels per acre. The corresponding yields for corn are thirty-two,\r\nfifty-three and sixty-one bushels, and for clover they are one and\r\ntwo-tenths, one and six-tenths and two and two-tenths tons of hay\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nYou will wish to know also that the Ohio Station has conducted a\r\nfive-year rotation of corn, oats, wheat, clover, and timothy for the\r\nlast fifteen years, both with and without the application of\r\ncommercial plant food. As an average of the fifteen years the\r\nunfertilized and fertilized tracts have produced, respectively:\r\n\r\n30 and 48 bushels of corn\r\n\r\n32 and 50 bushels of oats and 27 bushels of wheat .9 and 1.6 tons of\r\nclover\r\n\r\n1.3 and 1.8 tons of timothy\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the unfertilized land produced nine-tenths ton of clover,\r\nwhile land treated with farm manure produced three and two-tenths\r\ntons per acre.\r\n\r\nYou will welcome the information that the average yield of wheat on\r\nan Illinois experiment field down here in \"Egypt,\" in a four-year\r\nrotation, including both cowpeas and clover, has been eleven and\r\none-half bushels on unfertilized land, fourteen bushels where legume\r\ncrops have been plowed under, and twenty-seven bushels where\r\nlimestone and phosphorus have been added with the legume crops\r\nturned under; and that the aggregate value of the four crops, corn,\r\noats, wheat, and clover, from another \"Egyptian\" farm, has been\r\n$25.97 per acre on unfertilized land, and $54.24 where limestone and\r\nphosphorus have been applied.\r\n\r\nIn your very busy and very successful railroad experience, you may\r\nhave overlooked the reports of the Pennsylvania Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, showing the results of a four-year rotation of\r\ncrops that has been conducted with very great care for more than a\r\nquarter of a century. These, you will agree, are exactly such\r\nabsolute data as we sorely need just now when facing the stupendous\r\nproblem of changing from an agricultural system whose equal has\r\nnever been known for rapidity of soil exhaustion to a system which\r\nshall actually enrich the land. By averaging the results from the\r\nfirst twelve years and also those from the second twelve years, in\r\nthis rotation of corn, oats, wheat, and hay (clover and timothy), we\r\nfind that the yields have decreased as follows:\r\n\r\nCorn decreased 34 per cent.\r\n\r\nOats decreased 31 per cent.\r\n\r\nWheat decreased 4 per cent.\r\n\r\nHay decreased 29 per cent.\r\n\r\nAppalling, is it not? It is the best information America affords in\r\nanswer to the question, Will the rotation of crops actually enrich\r\nthe land?\r\n\r\nNo, Sir. We cannot make crops nor bank accounts out of nothing. The\r\nrotation of crops does not enrich the soil, does not even maintain\r\nthe fertility of the soil. On the contrary, the rotation of crops,\r\nlike the rotation of your check book, actually depletes the soil\r\nmore rapidly than the single system; and, if you ever have your\r\nchoice between two farms of equal original fertility, one of which\r\nhas been cropped with wheat only, and the other with a good three or\r\nfive-year rotation, for fifty years, take my advice and choose the\r\n\"worn-out\" wheat farm. Then adopt a good system of cropping with a\r\nmoderate use of clover, and you will soon discover that your land is\r\nnot worn out, but \"almos' new lan\" as a good Swede friend of mine\r\nreported who made a similar choice. But beware of the land that has\r\nbeen truly worn out under a good rotation, which avoids the insects\r\nand diseases of the single crop system, and also furnishes regularly\r\na moderate amount of clover roots which decay very rapidly and thus\r\nstimulate the decomposition of the old humus and the liberation of\r\nmineral plant food from the soil.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have heard of Rothamsted. If not, your kindergarten\r\nteacher is at fault. A four-year rotation of crops has been followed\r\non Agdell field for more than sixty years. An average of the crop\r\nyields of the last twenty years reveals:\r\n\r\n(1) That the yield of turnips has decreased from ten tons to\r\none-half ton per acre since 1848.\r\n\r\n(2) That the yield of barley has decreased from forty-six bushels to\r\nfourteen bushels since 1849.\r\n\r\n(3) That the yield of clover has decreased from two and eight-tenth\r\ntons to one-half ton since 1850.\r\n\r\n(4) That the yield of wheat has decreased from thirty bushels to\r\ntwenty-four bushels since 1851, wheat, grown once in four years,\r\nbeing the only crop worth raising as an average of the last twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNo, Sir. Neither optimism, nor ignorance, nor bigotry, nor deception\r\ncan controvert these facts.\r\n\r\nDo you know that the people of India rotate their crops? They do;\r\nand they use many legumes; and some of their soils now contain only\r\na trace of phosphorus, too small to be determined in figures by the\r\nchemist. Do you know there are more of our own Aryan Race hungry in\r\nIndia than live in the United States?\r\n\r\nDo you know that Russia regularly practices a three-year rotation\r\nand actually harvests only two crops in three years, with one year\r\nof green manuring? Yes, and the average yield of wheat for twenty\r\nyears is only eight and one-quarter bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThink on these things.\r\n\r\nYour _third principle _is, that \"of all forage fed to live stock at\r\nleast one-third in cash value remains on the land in the form of\r\nmanure that soon restores worn-out soil to fertility and keeps good\r\nland from deteriorating. By this system the farm may be made and\r\nkept a source of perpetual wealth.\"\r\n\r\nI grieve with you; pity 'tis, 'tis not true.\r\n\r\nNo, Sir. Neither crops nor animals can be made out of nothing, and\r\nno independent system of livestock farming can add to the soil a\r\npound of any element of plant food, aside from nitrogen, and even\r\nthis addition is due to the legume crops grown and not to the live\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nUnder the best system of live-stock farming about three-fourths of\r\nthe nitrogen, three-fourths of the phosphorus, and one-third of the\r\norganic matter contained in the food consumed can be returned to the\r\nland if the total excrements, both solid and liquid, are saved\r\nwithout loss. Of course, the produce used for bedding can all be\r\nreturned, but it could also be returned without live stock.\r\n\r\nUnder a good system of crop rotation with all grain sold from the\r\nfarm it is possible to return to the soil more than one-third of the\r\nphosphorus and more than one-half of the organic matter contained in\r\nthe crops, and even as much nitrogen as all of the crops remove from\r\nthe land in the grain sold. Thus, with a four-year rotation of\r\nwheat, corn, oats, and clover, and a catch crop of clover grown with\r\nthe wheat and turned under late the following spring for corn, we\r\nmay plow under three tons of clover containing one hundred and\r\ntwenty pounds of nitrogen, in return for the one hundred and\r\nnineteen pounds removed from the soil for the twenty-five bushels of\r\nwheat, fifty bushels of corn, and fifty bushels of oats. These\r\namounts of grain and the two bushels of clover seed might be sold\r\nfrom the farm, while the two and one-half tons of straw, one and\r\none-half tons of stalks, and three tons of clover might be returned\r\nto the land. These amounts aggregate seven tons of organic matter,\r\nor the equivalent of seventeen tons of manure, measured by the\r\nnitrogen content, or of twenty-four tons, measured by the content of\r\norganic matter. To replace the twenty-two pounds of phosphorus sold\r\nfrom the farm in the grain of these four crops would require the\r\nexpenditure of sixty-six cents at the present prices for raw\r\nphosphate delivered at Heart-of-Egypt.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt you will be glad to have your attention called to\r\nthe fact that the world does not live wholly, or even largely, upon\r\nmeat and milk. Bread is the staff of life, and I note from your\r\n_World's Work _article that you prefer to have the bread made of\r\nwheat. Thus, most farmers must raise and sell grain and vegetables.\r\n\r\nIf no independent system of live-stock farming can add a pound of\r\nphosphorus to the one hundred and sixty pounds still remaining in\r\nthe great body of the level uplands constituting forty-one per cent.\r\nof St. Mary county, and forty-five thousand seven hundred and\r\nseventy acres of Prince George county, Maryland, adjoining the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, nor even maintain the phosphorus supply in our\r\ngood lands, then what must we do to be fed?\r\n\r\nManifestly, we should make large use of legume crops for the\r\nproduction of farm manure or green manure; and, manifestly, America\r\nshould stop selling every year for five million dollars enough raw\r\nphosphate for the production of more than a billion dollars' worth\r\nof wheat. How long can we afford to give away a thousand millions\r\nfor five millions?\r\n\r\nOur annual corn crop is nearly three billion bushels, while the\r\nestimated value of all the timber on the still remaining federal\r\nlands is only one billion dollars. Again, our three trillion tons of\r\ncoal is sufficient for an annual consumption of half a billion tons\r\nfor six thousands years, whereas the United States Geological Survey\r\nhas estimated that at the present rate of increase in mining and\r\nexportation our total supply of high-grade phosphate will be\r\nexhausted in fifty years. It seems to me that about ninety per cent.\r\nof the talk about conservation of natural resources is directed\r\ntoward ten per cent. of the resources, when we remember the soil as\r\nthe foundation of all agriculture and all industry.\r\n\r\nDo you know, Mr. Hill, that, at the Second Conservation Conference\r\ncalled by the President of the United States, Doctor Van Hise, of\r\nthe University of Wisconsin, was the only man to raise his voice in\r\nthe interests of the common soils of America? For three days the\r\nstatesman and experts discussed the forests, forests, forests, and\r\nthe waters, waters, and the coal and iron; and for fifteen minutes\r\nPresident Van Hise pleaded for the conservation of phosphate, _the\r\nmaster key to all our material prosperity; _and he was called a\r\ncrank with a hobby.\r\n\r\nWith deep respect, I am,\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nPERCY JOHNSTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nADVANCE INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEART-OF-EGYPT, November 14, 1909.\r\n\r\nDEAR father and mother: I can scarcely realize that I have been an\r\n\"Egyptian\" for almost two years. I feel that the time has been\r\nshorter than two months of school-teaching.\r\n\r\nPercy is so encouraged with the crops that I rejoice with him,\r\nalthough I could never weep with him unless I weep for joy. He says\r\nthe crops needed only that I should stroll over the fields with him;\r\nthat they would grow rapidly if I only looked at them. Think of\r\nit--I drove the mower to cut hay,--not all of the 80 acres, to be\r\nsure, but I cut where it yielded two tons per acre. That is on No.\r\n4, where Percy applied his first cars of limestone. I wish you could\r\nhave seen the untreated strips--no clover and only half a ton of\r\nweedy timothy, while the rest of No. 4 and No. 6 were clean hay of\r\nmixed alsike and timothy. Percy says that No. 4 produced as much\r\nreal hay last year as all the rest of the farm has produced since he\r\ncame, and that the hay crop this year is worth as much for feed as\r\nall that has been harvested during the previous five years; and the\r\ncattle and horses seem to agree with him.\r\n\r\nWe sold our main lot of hogs for $654, and have another lot to go\r\nlater. We are getting so many horses and cattle on the place, that\r\nwe are going out of the hog business.\r\n\r\nPercy says that hogs belong more properly in the corn belt, than in\r\nthe wheat and fruit belt. You know the year I came the corn crop was\r\non No. I, which had never grown anything but corn, oats, and wheat,\r\nso far as we can learn; and the corn was so poor the hogs ate most\r\nof it in two months' time. During the same two months the price of\r\nhogs dropped from 7 to 4-1/2 cents, so that the hogs were worth no\r\nmore after eating the corn crop than they were before.\r\n\r\nNext year we are to have corn on No. 4, and Percy says it will be\r\nthe first time that corn has had a \"ghost of a show to make a decent\r\ncrop\" since he bought the place. The spring before we were married\r\nhe reseeded that forty, sowing mixed alsike and timothy. The clover\r\ncame on finely, evidently because the scanty growth of clover the\r\nyear before had at least allowed the field to become thoroughly\r\ninfected with the clover bacteria. There was no clover on the\r\nunlimed strip. So we say that limestone and bacteria brought clover.\r\nThe hay and other feed has made manure enough so that No. 4 has been\r\ncompletely covered with six tons per acre, and the phosphate has\r\nalso been applied; so with manure and phosphate on clover ground we\r\nhope to grow corn next year, if we have good weather.\r\n\r\nThe phosphate has also been put on some of the other forties. I\r\nconvinced him that the money will pay a higher rate of interest in\r\nphosphate than it would in the savings bank, even if he put it on\r\nbefore manure and clover could be plowed under. The experiments of\r\nseveral states show this very conclusively.\r\n\r\nThe corn is on No. 3 this year and it is the best crop in the six\r\nyears. Percy says the \"Terry Act\" (which means lots of work in\r\npreparing the land) is some help, but he thinks the phosphate shows\r\nagainst the check strips. The young wheat on No. 2 is looking fine,\r\nand with both limestone and phosphate on that field and the extra\r\nwork on the seed bed, we hope for a better crop than we have ever\r\ngrown on a full forty; even though we must depend solely upon our\r\nreserve stock of nitrogen for the crop. We are all about as jealous\r\nof that reserve stock of organic matter and nitrogen as we are of\r\nthe Winterbine bank account.\r\n\r\nI cannot forget how Percy tried to persuade me to postpone our\r\nwedding for a year because, as he said, the hogs had taken his corn\r\ncrop and given nothing in return for it; and above all how he\r\nobjected to my reimbursing the Winterbine reserve from my teacher's\r\nwages to the extent of $250, which he had drawn in part to tide over\r\nthe hard times, and in part to come to see me that Easter. But I am\r\nglad to have him still insist upon it that that uncertain venture\r\nproved his best investment, even if he does tease by adding that it\r\npaid one hundred and fifty per cent. net profit at Winterbine.\r\n\r\nWe are selling some cows this fall,--trying to weed out our herd by\r\nthe Babcock test which shows that \"some cows don't pay their board\r\nand keep,\" to quote Governor Hoard's lecture on \"Cows versus Cows,\"\r\nwhich Percy heard at Olney the winter Professor Barstow was married.\r\nThe \"versus cows\" are worth only $45.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you how I have enjoyed the summer. Sir Charles Henry\r\nis the dearest child, and his grandmother insists upon it that it is\r\nbetter for me to help Percy in the field with such light work as I\r\ncan do, and I am out for a few hours every day when the weather is\r\ngood. Percy's mother is such a dear. I am sure she could be no more\r\nsweet and loving to an own daughter. She had Percy all to herself\r\nfor so long that I was really afraid she might not like to share him\r\nwith me, but Percy says that it was his mother who persuaded him to\r\nmake us that Easter visit. We tell her that she hasn't much use for\r\neither of us now, and that we are likely to get jealous because\r\nCharles Henry gets so much of her affection.\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you of Percy's four-acre patch of wheat. He said it\r\nis so long to wait till 1912 for his first wheat crop on land that\r\nhad grown clover at least once during historic times that he thought\r\nhe would fix up a little patch to grow a crop of wheat, just to see\r\nhow real wheat would look; or, as he sometimes says, to see how\r\nwheat grows in \"Egypt\" when it has a ghost of a chance.\r\n\r\nHe treated a four-acre patch down by the wood's pasture with\r\nlimestone, phosphorus, and farm manure, did the \"Terry Act\" in\r\npreparing the seed bed, and drilled in a good variety of wheat, on\r\nOctober 17,--a little later than he likes to finish sowing wheat. It\r\ncame up with a good stand but did not make very much fall growth,\r\npartly owing to the dry weather. In the spring the man came across\r\nthe patch and reported to Percy that the wheat was mighty small and\r\nhe guessed it was \"gone up,\" although it seemed to be all alive.\r\nPercy said that he would not worry about it if it were alive because\r\nthe wheat would find something to please it when it really woke up\r\nin the spring. I reckon it did, for a neighbor passed on his way to\r\ntown in early May and called over the fence to Percy that his patch\r\nof rye down by the woods was looking fine. Well the four acres\r\nyielded 129-1/2 bushels, or a little more than thirty-two bushels\r\nper acre. Percy said if he could have eighty acres of it and sell it\r\nfor $1.18 a bushel, the same as he got for the last he sold, it\r\nwould amount to twice the original cost of the land--and then some.\r\n\r\nMr. Barton asked him if he could not raise \"just as good crops with\r\ngood old farm manure,\" and if he could not build up his whole farm\r\nwith farm manure. Percy said yes, but he would need three thousand\r\ntons for the first application. Mr. Barton then suggested that that\r\nwas more than the whole township produced.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 has been in pasture for three years, clover and grass having\r\nbeen seeded in 1906, even though the wet weather had prevented the\r\nseeding of wheat the fall before, and the ground was left too rough\r\nfor the mower. Percy hopes to have that forty completely covered\r\nwith manure by the time he will be ready to apply the phosphate and\r\nplow it under for the 19 I I corn crop.\r\n\r\nNow your \"Egyptian\" son has just read over this long, long letter,\r\nand he says that if I were a real wise old farmer I would not begin\r\nto talk about results before a single forty acres of grain had had a\r\nghost of a chance to make a crop. He says that every bushel of corn,\r\noats, and wheat that this old farm has produced during the last six\r\nyears has been wholly at the expense of the meager stock of reserve\r\nnitrogen still left in the soil after seventy-five years of almost\r\ncontinuous effort to \"work the land for all that's in it\" He says\r\nthat we have no right to expect really good crops until after the\r\nsecond rotation is completed, because the clover grown during the\r\nfirst rotation does not have a fair show, the limestone not yet\r\nbeing well mixed with the soil, the phosphorus supply being\r\ninadequate, the inoculation or infection being imperfect, and no\r\nprovision whatever having been made to supply decaying organic\r\nmatter in advance of the first clover crop. I think he is right as\r\nusual and I promise to give no more advance information hereafter\r\nexcept upon inquiry, at least not until 1918, when the first wheat\r\ncrop will be grown on land which has been twice in clover. We are\r\nmighty sorry not to be able to be with you for Thanksgiving or\r\nChristmas, but really we cannot go to the expense; our house is so\r\nsmall (we just must build a larger barn) and our home equipment is\r\nso meager that, in the words which you will remember Percy told us\r\nhis mother credited to Mrs. Barton, I feel that as yet I must say,\r\n\r\n\"Do come over when you can.\"\r\n\r\nYour happy, loving daughter,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Three big oil wells, belonging to the class called \"gushers,\"\r\nhave been struck about seven or eight miles from Poorland Farm. We\r\nare all getting interested except Percy. He says he does not want\r\nany oil wells on his six rotation forties or in the wood's pasture,\r\nbut he might let them bore in the twelve-acre orchard, which has\r\nnever produced but one crop that paid for itself, and the profit\r\nfrom that is about all gone for the later years of spraying.\r\n\r\nThe first oil boom in Illinois was at Casey where they struck oil\r\nsix or eight years ago, but they say the wells there are dry already\r\nand they have to go back to farming again to get a living. Of course\r\nif we could get a hundred-barrel well on every ten acres and get a\r\nroyalty of $400 a day for a few years, it would help out nicely, but\r\nthe oil business is uncertain and short-lived, whereas, to quote\r\nPercy \"the soil is the breast of Mother Earth, from which her\r\nchildren must always draw their nourishment.\"\r\n\r\nSome have spoken to Percy about the coal right, but he says if there\r\nare ten thousand tons of coal per acre under Poorland Farm, he will\r\nsave it for Charles Henry before he will allow anyone else to take\r\nit out for less than ten cents a ton. He says that just because the\r\nUnited States Government was generous enough to give the settler\r\nthree hundred and twenty acres of land, and foolish enough to throw\r\nin with it three million tons of coal if it happened to lie beneath,\r\nis no reason why he should sell it to any coal company or coal trust\r\nat the rate of ten tons for one cent, which is the same as ten\r\ndollars per acre for the coal right. He says if Uncle Sam ever wants\r\nto assume his rightful ownership of all coal, phosphate deposits, or\r\nother minerals whose conservation and proper use is essential to the\r\ncontinued prosperity of all the people, then our coal shall be his;\r\nbut, if he does not want it then he will consider nothing less than\r\nleasing on the basis of a royalty of ten cents a ton to be paid to\r\nhim, his heirs, and assigns, etc.; but even then he wants enough\r\ncoal left to hold up the earth, so that there will be no\r\ninterference with the tile drains which he expects sometime to put\r\ndown at an expense exceeding the original cost of the land. With\r\nmuch love,\r\n\r\nADELAIDE.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Percy sends his love to grandma and a photograph for Papa,\r\nfrom which you will see that on such land as ours no limestone or\r\nphosphate means no clover.--A. W. J.\r\n\r\nThe author takes this occasion to say to the kind reader who has had\r\nthe patience and the necessary interest in the stupendous problem\r\nnow confronting the American people, of devising and adopting into\r\ngeneral practice independence systems of farming that will restore,\r\nincrease, and permanently maintain the productive power of American\r\nfarm lands,--to those who have read thus far the _Story of the Soil\r\n_and who may have some desire for more specific and more complete or\r\ncomprehensive information upon the subject,--to all such he takes\r\nthis occasion to say that this volume is based scientifically upon\r\n\"Soil Fertility and Permanent Agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nThis little book is intended as an introduction to the subject; the\r\nother may be classed as technical, but nevertheless can be\r\nunderstood by any one who gives it serious thought. This book tells\r\nthe true story of the soil, for which the other gives a thousand\r\nproofs.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgment is here expressed that even the measure of\r\nsuccess thus far attained on Poorland Farm has been possible largely\r\nthrough the co-operation of a beloved brother, Carl Edwin, the man\r\nwho does a world of work, ably assisted by \"Adelaide.\"",
