Much less have\r\nthe questions that concern rural social advancement found the popular\r\nmind; in truth, the general city public has not been deeply interested\r\nin the farmer.\r\n\r\nBut there seem to be recent indications that the sentiment is changing.\r\nThe heated discussions in New England about Mr. Hartt's interesting\r\nclinic over a decadent hill-town, the suggestive fast-day proclamation\r\nof Governor Rollins of New Hampshire a few years ago, the marvelous\r\ndevelopment of agricultural education, the renewed study of the rural\r\nschool, the widespread and growing delight in country life, have all\r\naroused an interest in and presage a new attention to rural conditions.\r\nThis is well. The sociologist can hardly afford to omit the rural\r\nclasses from the scope of his study, especially if he desires to\r\ninvestigate the practical phases of his subject. Moreover, no one with\r\nintelligent notions of affairs should be ignorant of the forces that\r\ncontrol rural life.\r\n\r\nIn view of this apparent change in the attitude of people toward the\r\nfarm problem, it may not be idle to suggest some possible errors that\r\nshould be avoided when we are thinking of rural society. The student\r\nwill doubtless approach his problem fortified against misconceptions--he\r\nprobably has thoughtfully established his view-point. But the average\r\nperson in the city is likely to call up the image of his ancestral home\r\nof a generation ago, if he were born in the country, or, if not, to draw\r\nupon his observations made on a summer vacation or on casual business\r\ntrips into the interior. Or he takes his picture from _Shore Acres_ and\r\nthe _Old Homestead_. In any case it is not improbable that the image may\r\nbe faulty and as a consequence his appreciation of present conditions\r\nwholly inadequate. Let us consider some of these possible sources of\r\nmisconception.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is not fair to compare country life as a whole\r\nwith the best city conditions. This is often done. The observer usually\r\nhas education, culture, leisure, the experience of travel, more or less\r\nwealth; his acquaintance is mostly with people of like attainments.\r\nWhen he fails to find a rural environment that corresponds in some\r\ndegree to his own and that of his friends, he is quick to conclude that\r\nthe country has nothing to offer him, that only the city ministers to\r\nthe higher wants of man. He forgets that he is one of a thousand in the\r\ncity, and does not represent average city life. He fails to compare the\r\naverage country conditions with the average city conditions, manifestly\r\nthe only fair basis for comparison. Or he may err still more grievously.\r\nHe may set opposite each other the worst country conditions and the\r\nbetter city conditions. He ought in all justice to balance country slum\r\nwith city slum; and certainly so if he insists on trying to find\r\npalaces, great libraries, eloquent preachers, theaters, and rapid\r\ntransit in each rural community. City life goes to extremes; country\r\nlife, while varied, is more even. In the country there is little of\r\nlarge wealth, luxury, and ease; little also of extreme poverty, reeking\r\ncrime, unutterable filth, moral sewage. Farmers are essentially a middle\r\nclass and no comparison is fair that does not keep this fact ever in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes hear the expression, \"Country life is so barren--that to me\r\nis its most discouraging aspect.\" Much country life is truly barren;\r\nbut much more of it is so only relatively and not essentially. We must\r\nadmit that civilization is at least partially veneer; polish does\r\nwonders for the appearance of folks as well as of furniture. But while\r\nthe beauty of \"heart of oak\" is enhanced by its \"finish,\" its utility is\r\nnot destroyed by a failure to polish it. Now, much of the so-called\r\nbarrenness of country life is the oak minus the polish. We come to\r\nregard polish as essential; it is largely relative. And not only may we\r\napply the wrong standard to the situation, but our eyes may deceive us.\r\nTo the uninitiated a clod of dry earth is the most unpromising of\r\nobjects--it is cousin to the stone, and the type of barrenness. But to\r\nthe elect it is pregnant with the possibilities of seed-time and\r\nharvest, of a full fruitage, of abundance and content for man and beast.\r\nAnd there is many a farm home, plain to an extreme, devoid of the\r\nveneer, a home that to the man of the town seems lacking in all the\r\nthings that season life, but a home which virtue, intelligence, thrift,\r\nand courage transform into a garden of roses and a type of heaven. I do\r\nnot justify neglect of the finer material things of life, nor plead for\r\ndrab and homespun as passports to the courts of excellence; but I insist\r\nthat the plainness, simple living, absence of luxury, lack of polish\r\nthat may be met with in the country, do not necessarily accompany a\r\ncondition barren of the essentials of the higher life.\r\n\r\nSometimes rural communities are ridiculed because of the trivial nature\r\nof their gossip, interests, and ambitions. There may be some justice in\r\nthe criticism, though the situation is pathetic rather than humorous.\r\nBut is the charge wholly just? In comparing country with town we are\r\ncomparing two environments; necessarily, therefore, objects of gossip,\r\ninterests, and ambitions differ therein. We expect that. It is no\r\ncriticism to assert that fact. The test is not that of an existing\r\ndifference, but of an essential quality. Is not Ben Bolt's new top buggy\r\nas legitimate a topic for discussion as is Arthur John Smythe's new\r\nautomobile? Does not the price of wheat mean as much to the hard-working\r\ngrower as to the broker who may never see a grain of it? May not the\r\ngrove at Turtle Lake yield as keen enjoyment as do the continental\r\nforests? Is the ambition to own a fine farm more ignoble than the desire\r\nto own shares in a copper mine? It really does not matter so much what\r\none gossips about or what one's delights are or what the carving of the\r\nrungs on ambition's ladder; the vital question is the effect of these\r\nthings on character. Do they stunt or encourage the inner life? It must\r\nbe admitted that country people do not always accept their environing\r\nopportunities for enjoying the higher life of mind and heart. But do\r\nthey differ in this respect from their cousins of the town?\r\n\r\nWe must remember, too, that this is a large country, and that a study of\r\nrural conditions in a certain community, township, county, state, or\r\nsection may not give us the correct basis upon which to determine the\r\nagricultural status of the country.\r\n\r\nNor must we make the mistake of confusing conservatism and decadence.\r\nThat the city will in many particulars always progress more rapidly than\r\nthe country is inevitable. But speed is not the ultimate criterion of a\r\nfull life. Again must we apply the test whether the gain is relative or\r\nessential. Telephones, free mail delivery, electric car lines, operas,\r\ngreat libraries, cathedrals--all come to the city first, some of them\r\nsolely to the city. The country cannot hope to be other than inherently\r\nconservative as regards such institutions. But may there not be found\r\nsuch adaptations of or substitutes for these institutions as shall not\r\nonly preserve the rural community from decadence, but, indeed, build it\r\nup into strength, beauty, and purity?\r\n\r\nComparative lack of identical resources need not mean poverty of\r\nattainment. Let us agree that relatively the country will lag behind the\r\ntown. Is the country continually gaining in those things that are\r\nfundamentally important and that minister to its best life? is the\r\nkernal question.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most common error in studying rural conditions is the\r\nfailure to distinguish the vital difference between the urban problem\r\nand the rural problem. _Sociologically the city problem is that of\r\ncongestion; the rural problem is that of isolation._ The social\r\nconditions of country and city are wholly different. Institutions that\r\nsucceed in alleviating social disorders in the town may or may not\r\nsucceed in the country--in any event they must be adapted to country\r\nneeds. This applies to organizations, schools, libraries, social\r\nsettlements. And the adaptation must be one not only of form but of\r\nspirit. In other words, the farm problem is a peculiar problem,\r\ndemanding special study, a new point of view, and sometimes unique\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThose accustomed to large cities make a pretty broad classification of\r\n\"country.\" A town of five thousand people is to them \"country.\" But it\r\nis not country. The problem of the village and the small town is not the\r\nrural problem, take it the nation over. The smaller the town, the more\r\nnearly it approaches to rural conditions, but its essential problem is\r\nnot that of the farm.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, let no one suppose that philanthropy is the chief medicine\r\nfor the social ill-health of the country. The intelligent student who\r\npossesses the true spirit of helpfulness may find in the rural problem\r\nample scope for both his brain and his heart. But he will make a\r\nfundamental and irreparable error if he starts out with the notion that\r\npity, charity, and direct gifts will win the day. You may flatter the\r\nAmerican farmer; you cannot patronize him. He demands and needs, not\r\nphilanthropy, but simple justice, equal opportunity, and better\r\nfacilities for education. He is neither slave nor pauper.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: There is a farm problem, and it is worth solving. But it\r\ndiffers from the city problem. And if, as is to be hoped, the recently\r\nrenewed interest in this question is to be permanent, we trust that\r\nthose who desire to make it a special study, as well as those whose\r\ninterest in it is general and widely human, may from the start avoid the\r\nerrors that are likely to obscure rural conditions when viewed through\r\ncity eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEMS OF PROGRESS[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to acquire a keen and permanent interest in the rural\r\nproblem unless one first of all is cognizant of its significance. And\r\nlack of knowledge at this point may in part account for the fact already\r\nalluded to that in America the farm problem has not been adequately\r\nstudied. So stupendous has been the development of our manufacturing\r\nindustries, so marvelous the growth of our urban population, so pressing\r\nthe questions raised by modern city life, that the social and economic\r\ninterests of the American farmer have, as a rule, received minor\r\nconsideration. We are impressed with the rise of cities like Chicago,\r\nforgetting for the moment that half of the American people still live\r\nunder rural conditions. We are perplexed by the labor wars that are\r\nwaged about us, for the time unmindful that one-third of the workers of\r\nthis country make their living immediately from the soil. We are\r\nastounded, and perhaps alarmed, at the great centralization of capital,\r\npossibly not realizing that the capital invested in agriculture in the\r\nUnited States nearly equals the combined capital invested in the\r\nmanufacturing and railway industries. But if we pause to consider the\r\nscope and nature of the economic and social interests involved, we\r\ncannot avoid the conclusion that the farm problem is worthy of serious\r\nthought from students of our national welfare.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that agriculture does not hold the same relative rank among\r\nour industries that it did in former years, and that our city population\r\nhas increased far more rapidly than has our rural population. We do not\r\nignore the fact that urban industries are developing more rapidly than\r\nis agriculture, nor deny the seriousness of the actual depletion of\r\nrural population, and even of community decadence, in some portions of\r\nthe Union. But these facts merely add to the importance of the farm\r\nquestion. And it should not be forgotten that there has been a large and\r\nconstant growth both of our agricultural wealth and of our rural\r\npopulation. During the last half-century there was a gain of 500 per\r\ncent. in the value of farm property, while the non-urban population\r\nincreased 250 per cent. Agriculture has been one of the chief elements\r\nof America's industrial greatness, it is still our dominant economic\r\ninterest, and it will long remain at least a leading industry. The\r\npeople of the farm have furnished a sturdy citizenship and have been the\r\nprimary source of much of our best leadership in political, business,\r\nand professional life. For an indefinite future, a large proportion of\r\nthe American people will continue to live in a rural environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE FARM PROBLEM?\r\n\r\nCurrent agricultural discussion would lead us to think that the farm\r\nproblem is largely one of technique. The possibilities of the\r\nagricultural industry, in the light of applied science, emphasize the\r\nneed of the farmer for more complete knowledge of soil and plant and\r\nanimal, and for increased proficiency in utilizing this knowledge to\r\nsecure greater production at less cost. This is a fundamental need. It\r\nlies at the basis of success in farming. But it is not the farm problem.\r\n\r\nBusiness skill must be added, business methods enforced. The farmer must\r\nbe not only a more skilful produce-grower, but also a keener\r\nproduce-seller. But the moment we enter the realm of the market we step\r\noutside the individualistic aspect of the problem as embodied in the\r\ncurrent doctrine of technical agricultural teaching, and are forced to\r\nconsider the social aspect as emphasized, first of all, in the economic\r\ncategory of price. Here we find many factors--transportation cost,\r\ngeneral market conditions at home and abroad, the status of other\r\nindustries, and even legislative activities. The farm problem becomes an\r\nindustrial question, not solely one of technical and business skill.\r\nMoreover, the problem is one of a successful industry as a whole, not\r\nmerely the personal successes of even a respectable number of individual\r\nfarmers. The farming class must progress as a unit.\r\n\r\nBut have we yet reached the heart of the question? Is the farm problem\r\none of technique plus business skill, plus these broad economic\r\nconsiderations? Is it not perfectly possible that agriculture as an\r\nindustry may remain in a fairly satisfactory condition, and yet the\r\nfarming class fail to maintain its status in the general social order?\r\nIs it not, for instance, quite within the bounds of probability to\r\nimagine a good degree of economic strength in the agricultural industry\r\nexisting side by side with either a peasant regime or a\r\nlandlord-and-tenant system? Yet would we expect from either system the\r\nsame social fruitage that has been harvested from our American yeomanry?\r\n\r\nWe conclude, then, that _the farm problem consists in maintaining upon\r\nour farms a class of people who have succeeded in procuring for\r\nthemselves the highest possible class status, not only in the\r\nindustrial, but in the political and the social order--a relative\r\nstatus, moreover, that is measured by the demands of American ideals._\r\nThe farm problem thus connects itself with the whole question of\r\ndemocratic civilization. This is not mere platitude. For we cannot\r\nproperly judge the significance and the relation of the different\r\nindustrial activities of our farmers, and especially the value of the\r\nvarious social agencies for rural betterment, except by the standard of\r\nclass status. It is here that we seem to find the only satisfactory\r\nphilosophy of rural progress.\r\n\r\nWe would not for a moment discredit the fundamental importance of\r\nmovements that have for their purpose the improved technical skill of\r\nour farmers, better business management of the farm, and wiser study and\r\ncontrol of market conditions. Indeed, we would call attention to the\r\nfact that social institutions are absolutely necessary means of securing\r\nthese essential factors of industrial success. In the solution of the\r\nfarm problem we must deliberately invoke the influence of quickened\r\nmeans of communication, of co-operation among farmers, of various means\r\nof education, and possibly even of religious institutions, to stimulate\r\nand direct industrial activity. What needs present emphasis is the fact\r\nthat there is a definite, real, social end to be held in view as the\r\ngoal of rural endeavor. The highest possible social status for the\r\nfarming class is that end.\r\n\r\nWe may now, as briefly as possible, describe some of the difficulties\r\nthat lie in the path of the farmers in their ambition to attain greater\r\nclass efficiency and larger class influence, and some of the means at\r\nhand for minimizing the difficulties. A complete discussion of the farm\r\nproblem should, of course, include thorough consideration of the\r\ntechnical, the business, and the economic questions implied by the\r\nstruggle for industrial success; for industrial success is prerequisite\r\nto the achievement of the greatest social power of the farming class.\r\nBut we shall consider only the social aspects of the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL ISOLATION\r\n\r\nPerhaps the one great underlying social difficulty among American\r\nfarmers is their comparatively isolated mode of life. The farmer's\r\nfamily is isolated from other families. A small city of perhaps twenty\r\nthousand population will contain from four hundred to six hundred\r\nfamilies per square mile, whereas a typical agricultural community in a\r\nprosperous agricultural state will hardly average more than ten families\r\nper square mile. The farming class is isolated from other classes.\r\nFarmers, of course, mingle considerably in a business and political way\r\nwith the men of their trading town and county seat; but, broadly\r\nspeaking, farmers do not associate freely with people living under urban\r\nconditions and possessing other than the rural point of view. It would\r\nbe venturesome to suggest very definite generalizations with respect to\r\nthe precise influence of these conditions, because, so far as the writer\r\nis aware, the psychology of isolation has not been worked out. But two\r\nor three conclusions seem to be admissible, and for that matter rather\r\ngenerally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe well-known conservatism of the farming class is doubtless largely\r\ndue to class isolation. Habits, ideas, traditions, and ideals have long\r\nlife in the rural community. Changes come slowly. There is a tendency to\r\ntread the well-worn paths. The farmer does not easily keep in touch with\r\nrapid modern development, unless the movements or methods directly\r\naffect him. Physical agencies which improve social conditions, such as\r\nelectric lights, telephones, and pavements, come to the city first. The\r\natmosphere of the country speaks peace and quiet. Nature's routine of\r\nsunshine and storm, of summer and winter, encourages routine and\r\nrepetition in the man who works with her.\r\n\r\nA complement of this rural conservatism, which at first thought seems a\r\nparadox, but which probably grows out of these same conditions of\r\nisolation, is the intense radicalism of a rural community when once it\r\nbreaks away from its moorings. Many farmers are unduly suspicious of\r\nothers' motives; yet the same people often succumb to the wiles of the\r\ncharlatan, whether medical or political. Farmers are usually\r\nconservative in politics and intensely loyal to party; but the Populist\r\nmovement indicates the tendency to extremes when the old allegiance is\r\nleft behind. Old methods of farming may be found alongside\r\nill-considered attempts to raise new crops or to utilize untried\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\nOther effects of rural isolation are seen in a class provincialism that\r\nis hard to eradicate, and in the development of minds less alert to\r\nseize business advantages and less far-sighted than are developed by the\r\nintense industrial life of the town. There is time to brood over wrongs,\r\nreal and imaginary. Personal prejudices often grow to be rank and\r\ncoarse-fibered. Neighborhood feuds are not uncommon and are often\r\nvirulent. Leadership is made difficult and sometimes impossible. It is\r\neasy to fall into personal habits that may mark off the farmer from\r\nother classes of similar intelligence, and that bar him from his\r\nrightful social place.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be distinctly unfair to the farm community if we did\r\nnot emphasize some of the advantages that grow out of the rural mode of\r\nlife. Farmers have time to think, and the typical American farmer is a\r\nman who has thought much and often deeply. A spirit of sturdy\r\nindependence is generated, and freedom of will and of action is\r\nencouraged. Family life is nowhere so educative as in the country. The\r\nwhole family co-operates for common ends, and in its individual members\r\nare bred the qualities of industry, patience, and perseverance. The\r\nmanual work of the schools is but a makeshift for the old-fashioned\r\ntraining of the country-grown boy. Country life is an admirable\r\npreparation for the modern industrial and professional career.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, rural isolation is a real evil. Present-day living is so\r\ndistinctively social, progress is so dependent upon social agencies,\r\nsocial development is so rapid, that if the farmer is to keep his status\r\nhe must be fully in step with the rest of the army. He must secure the\r\nsocial view-point. The disadvantages of rural isolation are largely in\r\nthe realm of the social relations, its advantages mostly on the\r\nindividual and moral side. Farm life makes a strong individual; it is a\r\nserious menace to the achievement of class power.\r\n\r\nA cure for isolation sometimes suggested is the gathering of the farmers\r\ninto villages. This remedy, however, is of doubtful value. In the first\r\nplace, the scheme is not immediately practicable. About three and\r\none-half billions of dollars are now invested in farm buildings, and it\r\nwill require some motive more powerful than that inspired by academic\r\nlogic to transfer, even gradually, this investment to village groups.\r\nMoreover, it is possible to dispute the desirability of the remedy. The\r\nfarm village at best must be a mere hamlet. It can secure for the farmer\r\nvery few of the urban advantages he may want, except that of permitting\r\ncloser daily intercourse between families. And it is questionable if the\r\npetty society of such a village can compensate for the freedom and\r\npurity of rural family life now existing. It may even be asserted with\r\nsome degree of positiveness that the small village, on the moral and\r\nintellectual sides, is distinctly inferior to the isolated farm home.\r\n\r\nAt the present time rural isolation in America is being overcome by the\r\ndevelopment of better means of communication among farmers who still\r\nlive on their farms. So successful are these means of communication\r\nproving that we cannot avoid the conclusion that herein lies the remedy.\r\nImproved wagon roads, the rural free mail delivery, the farm telephone,\r\ntrolley lines through country districts, are bringing about a positive\r\nrevolution in country living. They are curing the evils of isolation,\r\nwithout in the slightest degree robbing the farm of its manifest\r\nadvantages for family life. The farmers are being welded into a more\r\ncompact society. They are being nurtured to greater alertness of mind,\r\nto greater keenness of observation, and the foundations are being laid\r\nfor vastly enlarged social activities. The problem now is to extend\r\nthese advantages to every rural community--in itself a task of huge\r\nproportions. If this can be done and isolation can be reduced to a\r\nminimum, the solution of all the other rural social problems will become\r\nvastly easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS' ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nOrganization is one of the pressing social problems that American\r\nfarmers have to face. The importance of the question is intrinsic,\r\nbecause of the general social necessity for co-operation which\r\ncharacterizes modern life. Society is becoming consciously\r\nself-directive. The immediate phase of this growing self-direction lies\r\nin the attempts of various social groups to organize their powers for\r\ngroup advantage. And if, as seems probable, this group activity is to\r\nremain a dominant feature of social progress, even in a fairly coherent\r\nsociety, it is manifest that there will result more or less of\r\ncompetition among groups.\r\n\r\nThe farming class, if at all ambitious for group influence, can hardly\r\navoid this tendency to organization. Farmers, indeed more than any\r\nother class, need to organize. Their isolation makes thorough\r\norganization especially imperative. And the argument for co-operation\r\ngains force from the fact that relatively the agricultural population is\r\ndeclining. In the old days farmers ruled because of mere mass. That is\r\nno longer possible. The naive statement that \"farmers must organize\r\nbecause other classes are organizing\" is really good social philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn the group competition just referred to there is a tendency for class\r\ninterests to be put above general social welfare. This is a danger to be\r\navoided in organization, not an argument against it. So the farmers'\r\norganization should be guarded, at this point, by adherence to the\r\nprinciple that organization must not only develop class power, but must\r\nbe so directed as to permit the farmers to lend the full strength of\r\ntheir class to general social progress.\r\n\r\nOrganization thus becomes a test of class efficiency, and consequently a\r\nprerequisite for solving the farm problem. Can the farming class secure\r\nand maintain a fairly complete organization? Can it develop efficient\r\nleaders? Can it announce, in sound terms, its proposed group policy? Can\r\nit lend the group influence to genuine social progress? If so, the\r\norganization of farmers becomes a movement of pre-eminent importance.\r\n\r\nOrganization, moreover, is a powerful educational force. It arouses\r\ndiscussion of fundamental questions, diffuses knowledge, gives practice\r\nin public affairs, trains individuals in executive work, and, in fine,\r\nstimulates, as nothing else can, a class which is in special need of\r\nsocial incentive.\r\n\r\nOrganization is, however, difficult of accomplishment. While it would\r\ntake us too far afield to discuss the history of farmers' organizations\r\nin America, we may briefly suggest some of the difficulties involved.\r\nFor forty years the question has been a prominent one among the farmers,\r\nand these years have seen the rise and decline of several large\r\nassociations. There have been apparently two great factors contributing\r\nto the downfall of these organizations. The first was a misapprehension,\r\non the part of the farmers, of the feasibility of organizing themselves\r\nas a political phalanx; the second, a sentimental belief in the\r\npossibilities of business co-operation among farmers, more especially in\r\nlines outside their vocation. There is no place for class politics in\r\nAmerica. There are some things legislation cannot cure. There are\r\nserious limitations to co-operative endeavor. It took many hard\r\nexperiences for our farmers to learn these truths. But back of all lie\r\nsome inherent difficulties, as, for instance, the number of people\r\ninvolved, their isolation, sectional interests, ingrained habits of\r\nindependent action, of individual initiative, of suspicion of others'\r\nmotives. There is often lack of perspective, and unwillingness to invest\r\nin a procedure that does not promise immediate returns. The mere fact of\r\nfailure has discredited the organization idea. There is lack of\r\nleadership; for the farm industry, while it often produces men of strong\r\nmind, keen perception, resolute will, does not, as a rule, develop\r\nexecutive capacity for large enterprises.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently asserted that farmers are the only class that has not\r\norganized. This is not strictly true. The difficulties enumerated are\r\nreal difficulties and have seriously retarded farm organization. But if\r\nthe progress made is not satisfactory, it is at least encouraging. On\r\nthe purely business side, over five thousand co-operative societies\r\namong American farmers have been reported. In co-operative buying of\r\nsupplies, co-operative selling of products, and co-operative insurance\r\nthe volume of transactions reaches large figures. A host of societies\r\nof a purely educational nature exists among stock-breeders,\r\nfruit-growers, dairymen. It is true that no one general organization of\r\nfarmers, embracing a large proportion of the class, has as yet been\r\nperfected. The nearest approach to it is the Grange, which, contrary to\r\na popular notion, is in a prosperous condition, with a really large\r\ninfluence upon the social, financial, educational, and legislative\r\ninterests of the farming class. It has had a steady growth during the\r\npast ten years, and is a quiet but powerful factor in rural progress.\r\nThe Grange is perhaps too conservative in its administrative policy. It\r\nhas not at least succeeded in converting to its fold the farmers of the\r\ngreat Mississippi Valley. But it has workable machinery, it disavows\r\npartisan politics and selfish class interests, and it subordinates\r\nfinancial benefits, while emphasizing educational and broadly political\r\nadvantages. It seems fair to interpret the principles of the Grange as\r\nwholly in line with the premise of this paper, that the farmers need to\r\npreserve their status, politically, industrially, and socially, and that\r\norganization is one of the fundamental methods they must use. The\r\nGrange, therefore, deserves to succeed, and indeed is succeeding.\r\n\r\nThe field of agricultural organization is an extensive one. But if the\r\nfarm problem is to be solved satisfactorily, the American farmers must\r\nfirst secure reasonably complete organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to assert that the education of that portion of\r\nthe American people who live upon the land involves a question of the\r\ngreatest significance. The subject naturally divides itself into two\r\nphases, one of which may be designated as rural education proper, the\r\nother as agricultural education. Rural education has to do with the\r\neducation of people, more especially of the young, who live under rural\r\nconditions; agricultural education aims to prepare men and women for the\r\nspecific vocation of agriculture. The rural school typifies the first;\r\nthe agricultural school, the second. Rural education is but a section of\r\nthe general school question; agricultural education is a branch of\r\ntechnical training. These two phases of the education of the farm\r\npopulation meet at many points, they must work in harmony, and together\r\nthey form a distinct educational problem.\r\n\r\nThe serious difficulties in the rural school question are perhaps\r\nthree: first, to secure a modern school, in efficiency somewhat\r\ncomparable to the town school, without unduly increasing the school tax;\r\nsecond, so to enrich the curriculum and so to expand the functions of\r\nthe school that the school shall become a vital and coherent part of the\r\ncommunity life, on the one hand translating the rural environment into\r\nterms of character and mental efficiency, and on the other hand serving\r\nperfectly as a stepping-stone to the city schools and to urban careers;\r\nthird, to provide adequate high-school facilities in the rural\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe centralization of district schools and the transportation of pupils\r\nwill probably prove to be more nearly a solution of all these\r\ndifficulties than will any other one scheme. The plan permits the\r\npayment of higher wages for teachers and ought to secure better\r\ninstruction; it permits the employment of special teachers, as for\r\nnature-study or agriculture; it increases the efficiency of\r\nsuperintendence; it costs but little, if any, more than the district\r\nsystem; it leaves the school amid rural surroundings, while introducing\r\ninto the schoolroom itself a larger volume, so to speak, of\r\nworld-atmosphere; it contains possibilities for community service; it\r\ncan easily be expanded into a high school of reputable grade.\r\n\r\nThere are two dangers, both somewhat grave, likely to arise from an\r\nurgent campaign for centralization. Even if the movement makes as great\r\nprogress as could reasonably be expected, for a generation to come a\r\nlarge share, if not a major portion, of rural pupils will still be\r\ntaught in the small, isolated, district school; there is danger that\r\nthis district school may be neglected. Moreover, increased school\r\nmachinery always invites undue reliance upon machine-like methods.\r\nCentralization permits, but does not guarantee, greater efficiency. A\r\nsystem like this one must be vitalized by constant and close touch with\r\nthe life and needs and aspirations of the rural community itself.\r\n\r\nWherever centralization is not adopted, the consolidation of two or\r\nthree schools--a modified form of centralization--may prove helpful.\r\nWhere the district school still persists, there are one or two\r\nimperative requirements. Teachers must have considerably higher wages\r\nand longer tenure. There must be more efficient supervision. The state\r\nmust assist in supporting the school, although only in part. The small\r\nschools must be correlated with some form of high school. The last\r\npoint is of great importance because of the comparative absence in\r\ncountry communities of opportunity near at hand for _good_ high-school\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nAgricultural education is distinctively technical, not in the restricted\r\nsense of mere technique, or even of applied science, but in the sense\r\nthat it must be frankly vocational. It has to do with the preparation of\r\nmen and women for the business of farming and for life in the rural\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nAgricultural education should begin in the primary school. In this\r\nschool the point of view, however, should be broadly pedagogical rather\r\nthan immediately vocational. Fortunately, the wise teaching of\r\nnature-study, the training of pupils to know and to love nature, the\r\nconstant illustrations from the rural environment, the continual appeal\r\nto personal observation and experience, absolute loyalty to the farm\r\npoint of view, are not only sound pedagogy, but form the best possible\r\nbackground for future vocational study. Whether we call this early work\r\n\"nature-study\" or call it \"agriculture\" matters less than that the\r\nfundamental principle be recognized. It must first of all _educate_. The\r\ngreatest difficulty in introducing such work into the primary school is\r\nto secure properly equipped teachers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most stupendous undertaking in agricultural education is the\r\nadequate development of secondary education in agriculture. The\r\noverwhelming majority of young people who secure any agricultural\r\nschooling whatever must get it in institutions that academically are of\r\nsecondary grade. This is a huge task. If developed to supply existing\r\nneeds, it will call for an enormous expenditure of money and for the\r\nmost careful planning. From the teaching view-point it is a difficult\r\nproblem. Modern agriculture is based upon the sciences; it will not do,\r\ntherefore, to establish schools in the mere art of farming. But these\r\nagricultural high schools must deal with pupils who are comparatively\r\nimmature, and who almost invariably have had no preparation in science.\r\nNor should the courses at these schools be ultra-technical. They are to\r\nprepare men and women for life on the farm--men and women who are to\r\nlead in rural development, and who must get some inkling at least of the\r\nreal farm question and its solution. The agricultural school, therefore,\r\npresents a problem of great difficulty.\r\n\r\nA perennial question in agricultural education is: What is the function\r\nof the agricultural college? We have not time to trace the history of\r\nthese colleges, nor to elaborate the various views relative to their\r\nmission. But let us for a moment discuss their proper function in the\r\nlight of the proposition that the preservation of the farmers' status is\r\nthe real farm problem; for the college can be justified only as it finds\r\nits place among the social agencies helpful in the solution of the farm\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the agricultural college, through its experiment station or\r\notherwise, is an organ of research, it should carry its investigations\r\ninto the economic and sociological fields, as well as pursue experiments\r\nin soil fertility and animal nutrition.\r\n\r\nIn the teaching of students, the agricultural college will continue the\r\nimportant work of training men for agricultural research, agricultural\r\nteaching, and expert supervision of various agricultural enterprises.\r\nBut the college should put renewed emphasis upon its ability to send\r\nwell-trained men to the farms, there to live their lives, there to find\r\ntheir careers, and there to lead in the movements for rural progress. A\r\ndecade ago it was not easy to find colleges which believed that this\r\ncould be done, and some agricultural educators have even disavowed such\r\na purpose as a proper object of the colleges. But the strongest\r\nagricultural colleges today have pride in just such a purpose. And why\r\nnot? We not only need men thus trained as leaders in every rural\r\ncommunity, but, if the farming business cannot be made to offer a career\r\nto a reasonable number of college-trained men, it is a sure sign that\r\nonly by the most herculean efforts can the farmers maintain their status\r\nas a class. If agriculture must be turned over wholly to the untrained\r\nand to the half-trained, if it cannot satisfy the ambition of strong,\r\nwell-educated men and women, its future, from the social point of view,\r\nis indeed gloomy.\r\n\r\nThe present-day course of study in the agricultural college does not,\r\nhowever, fully meet this demand for rural leadership. The farm problem\r\nhas been regarded as a technical question, and a technical training has\r\nbeen offered the student. The agricultural college, therefore, needs\r\n\"socializing.\" Agricultural economics and rural sociology should occupy\r\na large place in the curriculum. The men who go from the college to the\r\nfarm should appreciate the significance of the agricultural question,\r\nand should be trained to organize their forces for genuine rural\r\nprogress. The college should, as far as possible, become the leader in\r\nthe whole movement for solving the farm problem.\r\n\r\nThe farm home has not come in for its share of attention in existing\r\nschemes of agricultural education. The kitchen and the dining-room have\r\nas much to gain from science as have the dairy and the orchard. The\r\ninspiration of vocational knowledge must be the possession of her who is\r\nthe entrepreneur of the family, the home-maker. The agricultural\r\ncolleges through their departments of domestic science--better, of\r\n\"home-making\"--should inaugurate a comprehensive movement for carrying\r\nto the farm home a larger measure of the advantages which modern science\r\nis showering upon humanity.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural college must also lead in a more adequate development\r\nof extension teaching. Magnificent work has already been done through\r\nfarmers' institutes, reading courses, co-operative experiments,\r\ndemonstrations, and correspondence. But the field is so immense, the\r\nnumber of people involved so enormous, the difficulties of reaching them\r\nso many, that it offers a genuine problem, and one of peculiar\r\nsignificance, not only because of the generally recognized need of\r\nadult education, but also because of the isolation of the farmers.\r\n\r\nIt should be said that in no line of rural betterment has so much\r\nprogress been made in America as in agricultural education. Merely to\r\ndescribe the work that is being done through nature-study and\r\nagriculture in the public schools, through agricultural schools, through\r\nour magnificent agricultural colleges, through farmers' institutes, and\r\nespecially through the experiment stations and the federal Department of\r\nAgriculture in agricultural research and in the distribution of the best\r\nagricultural information--merely to inventory these movements properly\r\nwould take the time available for this discussion. What has been said\r\nrelative to agricultural education is less in way of criticism of\r\nexisting methods than in way of suggestion as to fundamental needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS PROBLEM\r\n\r\nWide generalizations as to the exact moral situation in the rural\r\ncommunity are impossible. Conditions have not been adequately studied.\r\nIt is probably safe to say that the country environment is extremely\r\nfavorable for pure family life, for temperance, and for bodily and\r\nmental health. To picture the country a paradise is, however, mere\r\nsilliness. There are in the country, as elsewhere, evidences of\r\nvulgarity in language, of coarseness in thought, of social impurity, of\r\ndishonesty in business. There is room in the country for all the ethical\r\nteaching that can be given.\r\n\r\nNor is it easy to discuss the country church question. Conditions vary\r\nin different parts of the Union, and no careful study has been made of\r\nthe problem. As a general proposition, it may be said that there are too\r\nmany churches in the country, and that these are illy supported.\r\nConsequently, they have in many cases inferior ministers. Sectarianism\r\nis probably more divisive than in the city, not only because of the\r\nnatural conservatism of the people and a natural disinclination to\r\nchange their views, but because sectarian quarrels are perhaps more\r\neasily fomented and less easily harmonized than anywhere else. Moreover,\r\nin the city a person can usually find a denomination to his liking. In\r\nthe country, even with the present overchurched condition, this is\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution of the country church problem is to have in each\r\nrural community one strong church adequately supported, properly\r\nequipped, ministered to by an able man--a church which leads in\r\ncommunity service. The path to the realization of such an ideal is rough\r\nand thorny. Church federation, however, promises large results in this\r\ndirection and should be especially encouraged.\r\n\r\nWhatever outward form the solution of the country church question may\r\ntake, there seem to be several general principles involved in a\r\nsatisfactory attempt to meet the issue. In the first place, the country\r\nchurch offers a problem by itself, socially considered. Methods\r\nsuccessful in the city may not succeed in the country. The country\r\nchurch question must then be studied thoroughly and on the ground.\r\n\r\nAgain, the same principle of financial aid to be utilized in the case of\r\nthe schools must be invoked here. The wealth of the whole church must\r\ncontribute to the support of the church everywhere. The strong must help\r\nthe weak. The city must help the country. But this aid must be given by\r\nco-operation, not by condescension. The demand cannot be met by home\r\nmissionary effort nor by church-building contributions; the principle\r\ngoes far deeper than that. Some device must be secured which binds\r\ntogether the whole church, along denominational lines if must be, for a\r\nfull development of church work in every community in the land.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is supreme necessity for adding dignity to the\r\ncountry parish. Too often at present the rural parish is regarded either\r\nas a convenient laboratory for the clerical novice, or as an asylum for\r\nthe decrepit or inefficient. The country parish must be a parish for our\r\nablest and strongest. The ministry of the most Christlike must be to the\r\nhill-towns of Galilee as well as to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThere is still another truth that the country church cannot afford to\r\nignore. The rural church question is peculiarly interwoven with the\r\nindustrial and social problems of the farm. A declining agriculture\r\ncannot foster a growing church. An active church can render especially\r\nstrong service to a farm community, in its influence upon the religious\r\nlife, the home life, the educational life, the social life, and even\r\nupon the industrial life. Nowhere else are these various phases of\r\nsociety's activities so fully members one of another as in the country.\r\nThe country church should co-operate with other rural social agencies.\r\nThis means that the country pastor should assume a certain leadership in\r\nmovements for rural progress. He is splendidly fitted, by the nature of\r\nhis work and by his position in the community, to co-operate with\r\nearnest farmers for the social and economic, as well as the moral and\r\nspiritual, upbuilding of the farm community. But he must know the farm\r\nproblem. Here is an opportunity for theological seminaries: let them\r\nmake rural sociology a required subject. And, better, here is a\r\nmagnificent field of labor for the right kind of young men. The country\r\npastorate may thus prove to be, as it ought to be, a place of honor and\r\nrare privilege. In any event, the country church, to render its proper\r\nservice, not alone must minister to the individual soul, but must throw\r\nitself into the struggle for rural betterment, must help solve the farm\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERATION OF FORCES\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the country church should ally itself with other\r\nagencies of rural progress may be carried a step farther. Rural social\r\nforces should be federated. The object of such federation is to\r\nemphasize the real nature of the farm problem, to interest many people\r\nin its solution, and to secure the co-operation of the various rural\r\nsocial agencies, each of which has its sphere, but also its limitations.\r\nThe method of federation is to bring together, for conference and for\r\nactive work, farmers--especially representatives of farmers'\r\norganizations, agricultural educators, rural school-teachers and\r\nsupervisors, country clergymen, country editors; in fact, all who have a\r\ngenuine interest in the farm problem. Thus will come clearer views of\r\nthe questions at issue, broader plans for reform, greater incentive to\r\naction, and more rapid progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn this brief analysis of the social problems of American farmers it has\r\nbeen possible merely to outline those aspects of the subject that seem\r\nto be fundamental. It is hoped that the importance of each problem has\r\nbeen duly emphasized, that the wisest methods of progress have been\r\nindicated, and that the relation of the various social agencies to the\r\nmain question has been clearly brought out. Let us leave the subject by\r\nemphasizing once more the character of the ultimate farm problem. This\r\nproblem may be stated more concretely, if not more accurately, than was\r\ndone at the opening of the paper, by saying that the ideal of rural\r\nbetterment is to preserve upon our farms the typical American farmer.\r\nThe American farmer has been essentially a middle-class man. It is this\r\ntype we must maintain. Agriculture must be made to yield returns in\r\nwealth, in opportunity, in contentment, in social position, sufficient\r\nto attract and to hold to it a class of intelligent, educated American\r\ncitizens. This is an end vital to the preservation of American\r\ndemocratic ideals. It is a result that will not achieve itself; social\r\nagencies must be invoked for its accomplishment. It demands the\r\nintelligent and earnest co-operation of all who love the soil and who\r\nseek America's permanent welfare.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] The material for this chapter is taken from an address entitled\r\n\"Social Problems of American Farmers,\" which was read before the\r\nCongress of Arts and Science, section of The Rural Community, at St.\r\nLouis, September, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE EXPANSION OF FARM LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrowness is perhaps the charge most often brought against American\r\nfarm life. To a certain extent this charge may be just, though the\r\ncomparisons that usually lead up to the conclusion do not always\r\ndiscriminate. It must be remembered that there are degrees of\r\ndesirability in farm life, and that at the least there are multitudes of\r\nrural communities where bright flowers still bloom, where the shade is\r\nrefreshing, and the waters are sweet. But, granting for the time that in\r\nthe main rural life is less pleasant, less rich, less expansive than\r\ncity life, we shall urge that this era of restriction is rapidly drawing\r\nto a close. There are forces at work that are molding rural life by new\r\nstandards, and the old regime is passing. We shall soon be able to say\r\nof the country that \"old things have passed away; all things have become\r\nnew.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement may seem too optimistic to some who can marshal an array\r\nof facts to prove that bigotry, narrowness, and the whole family of ills\r\nbegotten by isolation still thrive in the country. It is true that our\r\npicture is not all of rose tints. But what of that? If it were not true\r\nthere would be no farm problem; the country would have to convert the\r\ntown. The fact remains that rural life is undergoing a rapid expansion.\r\nMaterially, socially, and intellectually, the farmer is broadening. Old\r\nprejudices are fading. The plowman is no longer content to keep his eye\r\nforever on the furrow. The revival has been in slow progress for some\r\ntime and has not yet reached its zenith; indeed, the movement is but\r\nwell under way. For while the new day came long ago to some rural\r\ncommunities and they are basking in a noonday sun, yet in far too many\r\nlocalities the faintest gray of dawn is all that rouses hope.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental change that is taking place is the gradual adoption of\r\nthe new agriculture. \"Book-farmin'\" is still decried, and many\r\n\"perfessers\" have a rocky road to travel in their attempts to guide the\r\nmasses through the labyrinth of scientific knowledge that has been\r\nconstructed during the last decade or two. This difficulty has not been\r\nwholly the farmer's fault--the scientist would often have been more\r\npersuasive had his wings been clipped. But there is a decided \"getting\r\ntogether\" nowadays--the farmer and the man of science have at last\r\nfound common ground. And while the pendulum of agricultural prosperity\r\nshall always swing to and fro, there are, to change the figure, reasons\r\nfor believing that an increasing number of farmers have rooted the tree\r\nof permanent success.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate some of these reasons: (1) Thousands of farmers are farming\r\non a scientific basis. They use the results of soil and fertilizer\r\nanalysis; they cultivate, not to kill weeds so much as to conserve\r\nmoisture; horticulturists spray their trees according to formulas laid\r\ndown by experimenters; dairymen use the \"Babcock test\" for determining\r\nthe fat content of milk; stock-feeders utilize the scientists' feeding\r\nrations. (2) The number of specialists among farmers is increasing. This\r\nis a sign of progress surely. More and more farmers are coming to push a\r\nsingle line of work. (3) New methods are being rapidly adopted. Fifteen\r\nyears ago hardly a fruit-grower sprayed for insect and fungus pests;\r\ntoday it is rare to find one who does not. The co-operative creamery has\r\nnot only revolutionized the character of the butter product made by the\r\nfactory system, but it has set the pace for thousands of private\r\ndairymen who are now making first-class dairy butter. (4) In general\r\nthe whole idea of _intensive_ farming is gaining ground.\r\n\r\nThis specialization, or intensification, of agriculture makes a new\r\ndemand, upon those who pursue it, in the way of mental and business\r\ntraining. This training is being furnished by a multitude of agencies,\r\nand the younger generation of farmers is taking proper advantage of the\r\nopportunities thus offered. What are some of these regular agencies? (1)\r\nAn alert farm press, containing contributions from both successful\r\nfarmers and scientific workers. (2) Farmers' institutes, which are\r\ntraveling schools of technical instruction for farmers. (3) The\r\nbulletins issued by the government experiment stations located in every\r\nstate, and by the federal Department of Agriculture. (4) Special winter\r\ncourses (of from two to twelve weeks), offered at nearly all the\r\nagricultural colleges of the country, for instruction in practical\r\nagriculture. (5) Regular college courses in agriculture at these same\r\ncolleges. (6) Extension instruction by lectures and correspondence. (7)\r\nA growing book literature of technical agriculture. (8) More encouraging\r\nthan all else is the spirit of inquiry that prevails among farmers the\r\ncountry over--the recognition that there is a basis of science in\r\nagriculture. No stronger pleas for the advancement of agricultural\r\neducation can be found than those that have recently been formulated by\r\nfarmers themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this regeneration of farm life were wholly material it would be worth\r\nnoting; for it promises a prosperity built on foundations sufficiently\r\nstrong to withstand ordinary storms. Yet this is but a chapter of the\r\nstory. Not only are our American farmers making a study of their\r\nbusiness, bringing to it the resources of advancing knowledge and good\r\nmental training, and hence deriving from it the strong, alert mental\r\ncharacter that comes to all business men who pursue equally intelligent\r\nmethods, but the farmers are by no means neglecting their duty to\r\nbroaden along general intellectual lines. Farmers have always been\r\ninterested in politics; there is no reason to think that their interest\r\nis declining. The Grange and other organizations keep their attention on\r\ncurrent problems. Traveling libraries, school libraries, and Grange\r\nlibraries are giving new opportunities for general reading, and the\r\nfarmer's family is not slow to accept the chance. Low prices for\r\nmagazines and family papers bring to these periodicals an increasing\r\nlist from the rural offices. Rural free mail delivery promises, among\r\nmany other results of vast importance, to enlarge the circulation of\r\ndaily papers among farmers not less than tenfold.\r\n\r\nThe really great lesson that farmers are rapidly learning is to work\r\ntogether. They have been the last class to organize, and jealousy,\r\ndistrust, and isolation have made such organizations as they have had\r\ncomparatively ineffective. But gradually they are learning to\r\ncompromise, to work in harmony, to sink merely personal views, to trust\r\ntheir own leaders, to keep troth in financially co-operative projects.\r\nThere will be no Farmers' Party organized; but the higher politics is\r\ngaining among farmers, and more and more independent voting may be\r\nexpected from the rural precincts. Farmers are learning to pool such of\r\ntheir interests as can be furthered by legislation.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that the whole aspect of social life in the country is\r\nundergoing a profound evolutionary movement. Farmers are meeting one\r\nanother more frequently than they used to. They have more picnics and\r\nholidays. They travel more. They go sight-seeing. They take advantage of\r\nexcursions. Their social life is more mobile than formerly. Farmers\r\nhave more comforts and luxuries than ever before. They dress better\r\nthan they did. More of them ride in carriages than formerly. They buy\r\nneater and better furniture. The newer houses are prettier and more\r\ncomfortable than their predecessors. Bicycles and cameras are not\r\nuncommon in the rural home. Rural telephone exchanges are relatively a\r\nnew thing, but the near future will see the telephone a part of the\r\nordinary furniture of the rural household; while electric car lines\r\npromise to be the final link in the chain of advantages that is rapidly\r\ntransforming rural life--robbing it of its isolation, giving it balance\r\nand poise, softening its hard outlines, and in general achieving its\r\nthorough regeneration.\r\n\r\nThis sketch is no fancy tale. The movement described is genuine and\r\npowerful. The busy city world may not note the signs of progress.\r\nWell-minded philanthropists may feel that the rural districts are in\r\nspecial need of their services. Even to the watchers on the walls there\r\nis much of discouragement in the advancement that _isn't_ being made.\r\nYet it needs no prophet's eye to see that a vast change for the better\r\nin rural life and conditions is now in progress.\r\n\r\nNo student of these conditions expects or desires that the evolution\r\nshall be Acadian in its results. It is to be hoped indeed that country\r\nsweets shall not lose their delights; that the farmer himself may find\r\nin his surroundings spiritual and mental ambrosia. But what is wanted,\r\nand what is rapidly coming, is the breaking down of those barriers which\r\nhave so long differentiated country from urban life; the extinction of\r\nthat social ostracism which has been the farmer's fate; the obliteration\r\nof that line which for many a youth has marked the bounds of\r\nopportunity: in fact, the creation of a rural society whose advantages,\r\nrewards, prerogatives, chances for service, means of culture, and\r\npleasures are representative of the best and sanest life that the\r\naccumulated wisdom of the ages can prescribe for mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE NEW FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nAll farmers may be divided into three classes. There is the \"old\"\r\nfarmer, there is the \"new\" farmer, and there is the \"mossback.\" The old\r\nfarmer represents the ancient regime. The new farmer is the modern\r\nbusiness agriculturist. The mossback is a mediaeval survival. The old\r\nfarmer was in his day a new farmer; he was \"up with the times,\" as the\r\ntimes then were. The new farmer is merely the worthy son of a noble\r\nsire; he is the modern embodiment of the old farmer's progressiveness.\r\nThe mossback is the man who tries to use the old methods under the new\r\nconditions; he is not \"up\" with the present times, but \"back\" with the\r\nold times. Though he lives and moves in the present, he really has his\r\nbeing in the past.\r\n\r\nThe old farmer is the man who conquered the American continent. His axe\r\nstruck the crown from the monarchs of the wood, and the fertile farms of\r\nOhio are the kingdom he created. He broke the sod of the rich prairies,\r\nand the tasseling cornfields of Iowa tell the story of his deeds. He\r\nhitched his plow to the sun, and his westward lengthening furrows fill\r\nthe world's granary.\r\n\r\nThe new farmer has his largest conquests yet to make. But he has put his\r\nfaith in the strong arm of science; he has at his hand the commercial\r\nmechanism of a world of business. He believes he will win because he is\r\nin league with the ongoing forces of our civilization.\r\n\r\nThe mossback cannot win, because he prefers a flintlock to a Mauser. He\r\nhas his eyes upon the ground, and uses snails instead of stars for\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nThe old farmer was a pioneer, and he had all the courage, enterprise,\r\nand resourcefulness of the pioneer. He was virile, above all things\r\nelse. He owned and controlled everything in sight. He was a\r\nstate-builder. Half a century ago, in the Middle West, the strong men\r\nand the influential families were largely farmers. Even professional men\r\nowned and managed farms, frequently living upon them. The smell of the\r\nsoil sweetened musty law books, deodorized the doctor's den, and floated\r\nas incense above the church altars.\r\n\r\nThe new farmer lives in a day when the nation is not purely an\r\nagricultural nation, but is also a manufacturing and a trading nation.\r\nHe belongs no longer to the dominant class, so far as commercial and\r\nsocial and political influence are concerned. But none of these things\r\nmove him. For he realizes that out of this seeming decline of\r\nagriculture grow his best opportunities. He discards pioneer methods\r\nbecause pioneering is not now an effective art.\r\n\r\nThe mossback sees perhaps clearly enough these changes, but he does not\r\nunderstand their meaning, nor does he know how to meet them. He is\r\ndazzled by the romantic halo of the good old times, dumfounded by the\r\nelectric energy of the present, discouraged and distracted by the\r\npressure of forces that crush his hopes and stifle his strength.\r\n\r\nEconomically, the old farmer was not a business man, but a barterer. The\r\nrule of barter still survives in the country grocery where butter and\r\neggs are traded for sugar and salt. The old farmer was industrially\r\nself-sufficient. He did not farm on a commercial basis. He raised apples\r\nfor eating and for cider, not for market--there was no apple market. He\r\nhad very little ready money, he bought and sold few products. He traded.\r\nEven his grain, which afterward became the farmer's great cash crop, was\r\nraised in small quantities and ground at the nearest mill--not for\r\nexport, but for a return migration to the family flour-barrel.\r\n\r\nThe new farmer has always existed--because he is the old farmer growing.\r\nHe has kept pace with our industrial evolution. When the regime of\r\nbarter passed away, he ceased to barter. When the world's market became\r\na fact, he raised wheat for the world's market. As agriculture became a\r\nbusiness, he became a business man. As agricultural science began to\r\ncontribute to the art of farming, he studied applied science. As\r\nindustrial education developed, he founded and patronized institutions\r\nfor agricultural education. As alertness and enterprise began to be\r\nindispensable in commercial activity, he grew alert and enterprising.\r\n\r\nThe mossback is the man who has either misread the signs of the times,\r\nor who has not possessed the speed demanded in the two-minute class. He\r\nis the old farmer gone to seed. He tries to fit the old methods to the\r\nnew regime.\r\n\r\nBut it is not sufficient to picture the new farmer. You must explain\r\nhim. What is it that makes the new farmer? Who is he? What are his\r\ntools? In the first place, you cannot explain the new farmer unless you\r\nknow the old farmer. You cannot have the new farmer unless you also\r\nhave the mossback. The new farmer is a comparative person, as it were.\r\nYou have to define him in terms of the mossback. The contrast is not\r\nbetween the old farmer and the new, for that is merely a question of\r\nrelative conditions in different epochs of time. The contrast is between\r\nthe new farmer and the mossback, for that is a question of men and of\r\ntheir relative efficiency as members of the industrial order. Then, of\r\ncourse, you must observe the individual traits that characterize the new\r\nfarmer, such as keenness, business instinct, readiness to adopt new\r\nmethods, and, in fact, all the qualities that make a man a success today\r\nin any calling. For the new farmer, in respect to his personal\r\nqualities, is not a sport, a phenomenon. He does not stand out as a\r\ndistinct and peculiar specimen. He is a successful American citizen who\r\ngrows corn instead of making steel rails.\r\n\r\nBut you have not yet explained the new farmer. These personal traits do\r\nnot explain him. It may be possible to explain an individual and his\r\nsuccess by calling attention to his characteristics, and yet you cannot\r\ncompletely analyze him and his career unless you understand the\r\nconditions under which he works--the industrial and social environment.\r\nMuch less can you explain a class of people by describing their personal\r\ncharacteristics. You must reach out into the great current of life that\r\nis about them, and discern the direction and power of that current.\r\n\r\nNow, the conditions that tend to make the new farmer possible may be\r\ngrouped in an old-fashioned way under two heads. In the old scientific\r\nphrases the two forces that make the new farmer are the \"struggle for\r\nlife\" and \"environment,\" or, to use other words, competition and\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nCompetition has pressed severely upon the farmer, competition at home\r\nand competition from other countries. At one time the heart of the\r\nwheat-growing industry of this country was near Rochester, N. Y., in the\r\nGenesee Valley; but the canal and the railway soon made possible the\r\noccupation of the great granary of the west. A multitude of ambitious\r\nyoung men soon took possession of that granary, and the flour-mills were\r\nmoved from Rochester to Minneapolis. This is an old story, but the same\r\nforces are still at work. There has been developed a world-market. The\r\nsheep of the Australian bush have become competitors of the flocks that\r\nfeed upon the green Vermont mountains and the Ohio hills. The plains of\r\nArgentina grow wheat for London. Russia, Siberia, and India pour a\r\nconstant stream of golden grain into the industrial centers of Western\r\nEurope, and the price of American wheat is fixed in London. These forces\r\nhave produced still another kind of competition; namely, specialization\r\namong farmers. Localities particularly adapted to special crops are\r\nbecoming centers where skill and intelligence bring the industry to its\r\nheight. The truck-farming of the South Atlantic region, the fruit\r\ngrowing of western Michigan, the butter factories of Wisconsin and\r\nMinnesota, have crowded almost to suffocation the small market-gardener\r\nof the northern town, the man with a dozen peach trees, and the farmer\r\nwho keeps two cows and trades the surplus butter for calico. These\r\nthings have absolutely forced progress upon the farmer. It is indeed a\r\n\"struggle for life.\" Out of it comes the \"survival of the fittest,\" and\r\nthe fittest is the new farmer.\r\n\r\nBut along with competition has come opportunity. Indeed, out of these\r\nvery facts that have made competition so strenuous spring the most\r\nmarvelous opportunities for the progressive farmer. Specialization\r\nbrings out the best that there is in the locality and the man. It gives\r\na chance to apply science to farming. Our transportation system permits\r\nthe peach growers of Grand Rapids to place their crops at a profit in\r\nthe markets of Buffalo and Pittsburg; the rich orchards and vineyards of\r\nSouthern California find their chief outlet in the cities of the\r\nmanufacturing Northeast--three thousand miles away. During the forty\r\nyears, from 1860, the exports of wheat from this country increased from\r\nfour million bushels annually to one hundred and forty million bushels;\r\nof corn, from three and one-third million bushels to one hundred and\r\nseventy-five million bushels; of beef products, from twenty million\r\npounds to three hundred and seventy million pounds; of pork products,\r\nfrom ninety-eight million pounds to seventeen hundred million pounds.\r\nAnd not only do the grain and stock farmers find this outlet for their\r\nsurplus products, but we are beginning to ship abroad high-grade fruit\r\nand first-class dairy products in considerable quantities. Low rates of\r\nfreight, modern methods of refrigeration, express freight trains, fast\r\nfreight steamers--the whole machinery of the commercial and financial\r\nworld are at the service of the new farmer. Science, also, has found a\r\nworld of work in ministering to the needs of agriculture, and in a\r\nhundred different ways the new farmer finds helps that have sprung up\r\nfrom the broadcast sowing of the hand of science.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps even more remarkable opportunities come to the new farmer in\r\nthose social agencies that tend to remove the isolation of the country;\r\nthat assist in educating the farmer broadly; that give farmers as a\r\nclass more influence in legislature and congress, and that, in fine,\r\nmake rural life more worth the living. The new farmer cannot be\r\nexplained until one is somewhat familiar with the character of these\r\nrural social agencies. They have already been enumerated and classified\r\nin a previous chapter; they will be more fully described in subsequent\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that every successful farmer is necessarily a\r\nsupporter of all of these social agencies. He may be a prosperous farmer\r\njust because he is good at the art of farming, or because he is a keen\r\nbusiness man. But more and more he is coming to see that these things\r\nare opportunities that he cannot afford to disregard. Indeed, some of\r\nthese institutions are largely the creation of the new farmer himself.\r\nHe is using them as tools to fashion a better rural social structure.\r\n\r\nBut they also fashion him. They serve to explain him, in great part.\r\nCompetition inspires the farmer to his best efforts. The opportunity\r\noffered by these new and growing advantages gives him the implements\r\nwherewith to make his rightful niche in the social and industrial\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIt would be erroneous to suppose that the new farmer is a _rara avis_.\r\nHe is not. The spirit pervading the ranks of farmers is rapidly\r\nchanging. We have been in a state of transition in agriculture. But the\r\nfarther shore has been reached and the bridge is possible. The army of\r\nrural advancement is being recruited with great rapidity. The advance\r\nguard is more than a body of scouts, it is an effective brigade.\r\n\r\nI want also to make a plea for the mossback. He must not be condemned\r\nutterly. Remember that competition among farmers has been intense; that\r\nrural environment breeds conservatism. Remember also that the farmer\r\ncannot change his methods as rapidly as can some other business men.\r\nRemember, too, that there is comparatively small chance for speculation\r\nin agriculture; that large aggregates of capital cannot be collected for\r\nfarming, and consequently, that the approved means for securing immense\r\nwealth, great industrial advancement, and huge enterprises are nearly\r\nabsent in agriculture. Remember that the voices calling from the city\r\ndeplete the country of many good farmers as well as of many poor ones.\r\nMoreover, there are many men on farms who perhaps don't care for\r\nfarming, but who for some reason cannot get away. On the farm a man need\r\nnot starve; he can make a livelihood. Doubtless this simple fact is\r\nresponsible for a multitude of mossbacks. They can live without\r\nstrenuous endeavor. Possibly a good many of us are strenuous because we\r\nare pushed into it. So I have a good deal of sympathy for the mossback,\r\nand a mild sort of scorn for some of his critics, who probably could not\r\ndo any better than he is doing if they essayed the gentle art of\r\nagriculture. I also have sympathy for the mossback particularly because\r\nhe is the man that needs attention. The new farmer takes the initiative.\r\nHe patronizes these opportunities that we have been talking about. But\r\nthe mossback, because he is discouraged, or because he is ignorant, or\r\nperhaps merely because he is conservative, takes little interest in\r\nthese things. About one farmer in ten belongs to some sort of farmers'\r\nassociation. Thousands of farmers do not take an agricultural paper, and\r\nperhaps millions of them have not read an agricultural book. Right here\r\ncomes in another fact. Every \"new\" farmer when full grown competes with\r\nevery mossback. The educated farmer makes it still harder for the\r\nignorant farmer to progress.\r\n\r\nThe future of the American farmer is one of the most pregnant social\r\nproblems with which we have to deal. There is indeed an issue involved\r\nin the success of the new farmer that is still more fundamental than any\r\nyet mentioned. The old farmer had a social standing that made him\r\nessentially a middle-class man. He was a landholder, he was independent,\r\nhe was successful. He was the typical American citizen. The old farmer\r\nwas father to the best blood of America. His sons and his sons' sons\r\nhave answered to the roll call of our country's warriors, statesmen,\r\nwriters, captains of industry.\r\n\r\nCan the new farmer maintain the same relative social status? And if he\r\ncan, is he to be an aristocrat, a landlord, a captain of industry, and\r\nto bear rule over the mossback? And is the tribe of mossbacks destined\r\nto increase and become a caste of permanent tenants or peasants? Is the\r\nfuture American farmer to be the typical new farmer of the present, or\r\nare we traveling toward a social condition in which the tillers of the\r\nsoil will be underlings? Is there coming a time when the \"man with the\r\nhoe\" will be the true picture of the American farmer, with a low\r\nstandard of living, without ideals, without a chance for progress?\r\n\r\nWe must eliminate the mossback. It is to be done largely by education\r\nand by co-operation. There must be a campaign for rural progress. There\r\nmust be a union of the country school teacher, of the agricultural\r\ncollege professor, of the rural pastor, of the country editor, with the\r\nfarmers themselves, for the production of an increased crop of new\r\nfarmers. Anything that makes farm life more worth living, anything that\r\nbanishes rural isolation, anything that dignifies the business of\r\nfarming and makes it more prosperous, anything that broadens the\r\nfarmer's horizon, anything that gives him a greater grasp of the rural\r\nmovement, anything that makes him a better citizen, a better business\r\nman, or a better _man_, means the passing of the mossback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCULTURE FROM THE CORN LOT[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of questions that the college student asks himself is, What\r\nam I going to be? The surface query is, What am I going to _do_? But in\r\nhis heart of hearts he ponders the deeper questions: What may I become\r\nin real intellectual and moral worth? How large a man, measured by the\r\ndivine standards, will it be possible for me to grow into?\r\n\r\nThese are the great questions because growth is the great end of life.\r\nThat is what we are here for, to grow. To develop all our talents, all\r\nour possibilities, to increase our native powers of body, mind, and\r\nsoul--this is life. It is important that we have a vocation. We must do\r\nsomething, and do it well. But the real end is not in working at a\r\nprofession but in developing our abilities. Our symmetrical growth is\r\nthe measure of our success as human beings.\r\n\r\nAs the student looks out over the ocean of life and scans the horizon\r\nfor signs of the wise course for him to take, he should decide whether\r\nthe particular mode of life that now appeals to him will yield the\r\ngreatest possible measure of growth. He must consult his tastes, his\r\ntalents, his opportunities, his training. And the test question is, Will\r\nthis line of work yield me the growth, the culture, I desire?\r\n\r\nBut what are the elements that yield culture to an individual? Using\r\nculture in a very broad sense as a synonym for growth, we may say that\r\nthe things contributing most to the culture of the average person are\r\nhis work, his leisure, and his service to others. We may now try to\r\nanswer the question we started with, as it presents itself to many a\r\nstudent in the agricultural colleges of our country. Will agriculture as\r\na business, will the farm life and environment, contribute to the growth\r\nwhich I desire for myself? Can I extract culture from the corn lot?\r\n\r\nLet us first see if the work or vocation of farming gives culture. My\r\nanswer would be that there is scarcely an occupation to be named that\r\nrequires broader knowledge, more accurate observation, or the exercise\r\nof better judgment than does modern farming. The farmer deals with the\r\napplication of many sciences. He must be an alert business man. He\r\nrequires executive talent of no mean order. The study of his occupation\r\nin its wider phases leads him into direct contact with political\r\neconomy, social movements, and problems of government. The questions\r\nconfronting him as a farmer relate themselves to the leading realms of\r\nhuman knowledge and experience. I speak of course of the progressive\r\nfarmer, who makes the best use of his opportunities. He can hardly hope\r\nto become immensely wealthy, but he can maintain that modest standard of\r\nliving that usually is the lot of our most useful and cultured people\r\nand that ministers as a rule most fully to the ideal family life. The\r\ntruly modern farmer cannot help growing.\r\n\r\nThere is much hard work on the farm. Yet on the whole there is fully as\r\nmuch leisure as in most other occupations. There is time to read, and\r\nbooks are today so easily accessible that living in the country is no\r\nbar to the bookshelf. Better than time to read is time to think. The\r\nfarmer has always been a man who pondered things in his heart. He has\r\nhad a chance to meditate. No culture is sound except it has been bought\r\nby much thinking; all else is veneer. Farm life gives in good measure\r\nthis time to think. But it is in nature that the farmer finds or may\r\nfind his most fertile field for culture. Here he is at home. Here he\r\nmay revel if he will. Here he may find the sources of mind-liberation\r\nand of soul-emancipation. He may be the envy of everyone who dwells in\r\nthe city because he lives so near to nature's heart. Bird and flower,\r\nsky and tree, rock and running brook speak to him a various language. He\r\nmay read God's classics, listen to the music of divine harmonies, and\r\nroam the picture galleries of the Eternal. So too in his dealings with\r\nhis kind, he lives close to men and women who are frank, virile, direct,\r\nclean, independent. The culture coming from such associations is above\r\nprice. One learns to pierce all shams, to honor essential manhood, to\r\nkeep pure the fountains of sympathy, ambition, and love. Thus on the\r\nfarm one may find full opportunity for that second means of culture,\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nAnother powerful agency for cultivating the human soul is service.\r\nIndeed, service is the dynamic of life. To be of use is the ambition\r\nthat best stimulates real growth. Culture is the end of life, the spirit\r\nof service the motive power. So it is of this I would speak perhaps most\r\nfully, not only because it is a vital means of culture, but because it\r\nis also peculiarly the privilege and duty of the college man and the\r\ncollege woman. For let it be said that if any college student secures a\r\ndiploma of any degree without having been seized upon by a high ambition\r\nto be of some use in the work of helping humanity forward, then have\r\nthat person's years of study been in vain, and his teaching also vain.\r\nThe college man comes not to be ministered unto but to minister. He has\r\nbeen poorly taught if he leaves college with no thought but for his\r\nmaterial success. He must have had a vision of service, his lips touched\r\nwith a coal from the altar of social usefulness, and his heart\r\ncultivated to respond to the call for any need he can supply, \"Here am\r\nI, send me.\"\r\n\r\nI think it may safely be said that there is no field which offers better\r\nchance for leadership to the average college man or woman than does the\r\nfarm. Take, for instance, politics. The majority of our states are\r\nagricultural states. The majority of our counties are agricultural\r\ncounties. The agricultural vote is the determining factor in a large\r\nproportion of our elections. It follows inevitably that honest, strong\r\nfarmers with the talent for leadership and the ability to handle\r\nthemselves in competition with other political leaders have a\r\nmarvelously fine chance for useful service.\r\n\r\nSo is it in educational questions. Nowhere may the citizen come into\r\ncloser contact with the educational problems of the day than through\r\nservice on the rural school board. If he brings to this position trained\r\nintelligence, some acquaintance with educational questions, and a desire\r\nto keep in touch with the advancement of the times, he can do for his\r\ncommunity a service that can hardly be imagined.\r\n\r\nTake another field--that of organization for farmers, constituting a\r\nproblem of great significance. As yet this class of people is relatively\r\nunorganized, but the movement is growing and the need of well-trained\r\nleadership is vital. I cannot speak too strongly of the chance here\r\noffered for active, intelligent, masterful men and women in being of use\r\nas leaders and officials in the Grange and other farmers' organizations.\r\n\r\nSo with the church question. One of the reasons for the slow progress of\r\nthe country church is the conservatism in the pews as well as in the\r\npulpit. The ardent member of the Young Men's Christian Association in\r\ncollege may feel that, in the country, there will be no outlet for his\r\nambition to be of religious use to his fellow-men. This is a mistake.\r\nThe work of the Young Men's Christian Association itself in the country\r\ndistricts is just beginning, and promises large growth. Wider service in\r\nthe church, a community federation or union of different churches, the\r\nwork of young people's societies and of the Sunday schools--all these\r\nafford abundant opportunity for the man or the woman qualified and\r\nwilling.\r\n\r\nThere are other lines of usefulness. Although I have stated that on the\r\nfarm the opportunities for personal culture are great, it must be\r\nconfessed that these opportunities are not fully utilized by the average\r\nfarmer's family. Here then is a very wide field, especially for the\r\nfarmer's wife. For if she is a cultivated college woman, she can through\r\nthe woman's club, the Grange, the school, the nature-study club, the\r\ntraveling library, and in scores of ways exercise an influence for good\r\non the community that may have far greater results than would come from\r\nher efforts if expended in the average city. The farm home too has\r\nlatent capacities that are yet to be developed. It ought to be the ideal\r\nhome and, in many cases, it is. But there are not enough of such ideal\r\nhomes in the country. No college woman with a desire to do her full\r\nservice in the world ought for an instant to despise the chance for\r\nservice as it exists on the farm.\r\n\r\nAll of these opportunities so briefly suggested might be enlarged upon\r\nalmost indefinitely, but the mere mention of them emphasizes the call\r\nfor this service and this leadership. Nowhere are leaders more needed\r\nthan in the country. The country has been robbed of many of its\r\nstrongest and best. The city and perhaps the nation are gainers: but the\r\ncountry has suffered. From one point of view, the future of our farming\r\ncommunities depends upon the quality of leadership that we are to find\r\nthere during the next generation.\r\n\r\nSo we come back to our question, Can the farm be made to yield to the\r\nman or woman, residing upon it and making a living from it, that measure\r\nof growth and all-round development that the ambitious person wishes to\r\nattain? And our answer is, Yes. In its work, its leisure, its field for\r\nservice, it may minister to sound culture. If you love the life and work\r\nof the farm, do not hesitate to choose that occupation for fear of\r\nbecoming narrow or stunted. You can live there the full, free life. You\r\ncan grow to your full stature there. You can get culture from the corn\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] Addressed to students in an agricultural college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGENCIES OF PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nEDUCATION FOR THE FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two generations living subsequent to the year 1875 are to be\r\nwitnesses of an era in American history that will be known as the age of\r\nindustrial education. These years are to be the boundaries of a period\r\nwhen the general principle that every individual shall be properly\r\ntrained for his or her occupation in life is to receive its practical\r\napplication. Future generations will doubtless extend marvelously the\r\nlimits to which the principle can be pushed in its ministrations to\r\nhuman endeavor, but we are in the time when the principle is first to\r\nreceive general acceptation and is to be regarded as a fundamentally\r\nnecessary fact of human progress.\r\n\r\nWe are already \"witnesses of the light.\" Even within the memory of young\r\nmen has it come to pass that the old wine skins of the old educational\r\ninstitutions have been filled with the new wine of science and of\r\nknowledge and training applied to the industries and businesses of life.\r\n\r\nAgriculture has perhaps been slow to feel the current of the new wine\r\nas it flows from the wine press of fast-growing industrial and social\r\nneed. But the least hopeful of us can, I am sure, already see signs of a\r\nvast awakening. The farm, as well as the pulpit, the bar, the\r\nschoolroom, the shop, the counting-room, is breathing in the new idea\r\nthat knowledge and training can be made of use to every man.\r\n\r\nThis awakening is due not merely to the desire of agriculturists to be\r\nin fashion, nor to the efforts of agricultural pedagogues, but to a real\r\nneed. It is common knowledge that in America we have not farmed, but\r\nhave mined the soil. We have \"skimmed the cream\" of fertility, and\r\npassed on to conquer new areas of virgin soil. This pioneer farming has\r\nrequired hard work, enterprise, courage, and all the noble traits of\r\ncharacter that have made our American pioneers famous and that have\r\nwithin a century subdued a wilderness to civilization. But the farmer of\r\ntoday faces a new situation. The fertile lands are fairly well occupied.\r\nThe old lands are depleted. These old lands must be handled skilfully if\r\nthey are to produce profitably. They must be used because there is\r\nlittle else to use, and because they are near the best markets.\r\nMeantime, scientists have been studying the deep things of nature, and\r\nhave been learning the laws that govern soil, plant, and animal. Thus we\r\nhave the farmer's need met by the theorist's discoveries. The farmer, to\r\navail himself of these discoveries must know their meaning and be able\r\nto apply the general principle to the specific case. This means\r\nagricultural education.\r\n\r\nThen again, the consumption of high-class products increases at least as\r\nrapidly as does our wealth. The demand comes not alone from the rich,\r\nbut from the middle classes of our cities. Skilled artisans are large\r\nconsumers of choice meats, fruits, and vegetables. To grow these\r\nhigh-grade products means skill, and skill means training, and training\r\nin the large sense means education.\r\n\r\nThe need for agricultural education, is, then, a real and vital one. It\r\nis pressed upon us by economic and social conditions. It is in line with\r\nthe movement of the age.\r\n\r\nIn discussing agricultural education, we must not forget that the farmer\r\nis also a citizen and a man. He should be an intelligent citizen, and\r\nshould therefore study questions of government. As a man, he should be\r\nthe equal of other men of his same social rank. He therefore needs a\r\ngood general education. He is more than mere farmer. While as farmer he\r\nmust connect his business with its environment and out of his\r\nsurroundings gain sound culture; while he should know nature, not only\r\nas its master, but as its friend; he should also be in sympathy with all\r\nthat makes modern civilization worth while. And even as mere farmer, he\r\nfinds himself face to face with grave social problems. He must not only\r\nproduce but he must sell, and his selling powers are governed by\r\nconditions of the market, by transportation facilities and practices,\r\nand are affected by the laws of the land. Hence he must be a student of\r\nthese problems and must know the broad phases of agriculture and its\r\nrelations to other industries.\r\n\r\nNo intelligent man doubts the need of agricultural education. Let us,\r\nthen, say a word about the kind of education demanded. This question is\r\nsettled very largely by the discussion we have just had about the need\r\nof this education. First of all, this education will give a fair mastery\r\nof the principles that govern proper soil management and plant and\r\nanimal growth. This is fundamental. The farmer is dealing with natural\r\nlaws, and he must know in them their applications. He cannot be blind\r\nto their dominance. They insist on recognition. They are jealous masters\r\nand good servants. Nature serves only the man who obeys her. To obey he\r\nmust know. The truth shall make him free. How to secure larger crops of\r\nbetter products at less cost and still maintain soil fertility, is the\r\nfirst demand of modern agriculture, and its solution depends in large\r\nmeasure upon education.\r\n\r\nBut education does not stop here. The farmer is also a seller as well as\r\na producer. He is a business man. He is manager of an industry. He is an\r\ninvestor of capital. So the question will arise, Can he get any help\r\nfrom education in the handling of the business phases of his farm? He\r\ncertainly can. You cannot teach a man business in the sense of supplying\r\nhim with good sense, business judgment, ability to handle men, and so\r\non. But you can study the general conditions that govern the business of\r\nagriculture, and you can report the results of your researches to the\r\npractical farmer; and he, if he is willing, may learn much that will be\r\nhelpful to him in deciding the many difficult questions that confront\r\nhim as a business man. Farm administration in its largest sense will,\r\nthen, be a most important phase of agricultural education.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible for the individual farmer to succeed admirably if\r\nhe is equipped with a sound training in the principles of production and\r\nin farm management. But there are still larger questions that farmers as\r\na class must meet if agriculture is to have its full success and if the\r\nfarmer himself is to occupy the social position he ought to have.\r\nAgriculture is an industry among industries. Farmers are a class among\r\nclasses. As an industry, agriculture has relations to other industries.\r\nIt is subject to economic laws. It involves something more than growing\r\nand selling. The nature of the market, railroad rates, effects of the\r\ntariff and of taxation, are questions vital to agriculture. So with the\r\nfarmers socially considered. Their opportunities for social life, their\r\nschool facilities, their church privileges, their associations and\r\norganizations--all these are important matters. So agricultural\r\neducation will not fail to call attention to these larger questions.\r\n\r\nThe well-educated farmer will, then, be trained in three lines of\r\nthought--first, that which deals with the growth of products; second,\r\nthat which deals with the selling of products; and third, that which\r\ndeals with agriculture as an industry and farmers as a class of people.\r\n\r\nWe may next discuss as briefly as possible the methods by which\r\nagricultural education may be advanced. We may not consider all of them,\r\nbut rather attend only to some of those agencies that seem of peculiar\r\ninterest just at this time.\r\n\r\nThere is one underlying requisite of successful agricultural education\r\nthat is all-important. It is faith in agriculture. Any man to succeed\r\ngrandly must have absolute faith in his business. So the farmer must\r\nbelieve in agriculture. Agriculture cannot attain its highest rank\r\nunless the men engaged in it believe in it most profoundly. They must\r\nbelieve that a man can make money in farming. They must love the farm\r\nlife and surroundings. They must believe that the best days of\r\nagriculture are ahead of us, not behind us. They must believe that men\r\ncan find in agriculture a chance to use brains and to develop talents\r\nand to utilize education. Agricultural education rests on this faith.\r\nGive us a state filled with such farmers and we can guarantee a strong\r\nsystem of agricultural education. But the seeds of education cannot grow\r\nin a soil barren of the richness of sentiment for and confidence in the\r\nfarm. Our agricultural colleges have been criticized because they have\r\ngraduated so few farmers. But the fault is not all with the colleges.\r\nThe farmers also are to blame. They have not had faith enough in the\r\nfarm to advise young men to go to college to prepare for farming. They\r\nadmit the value of education for the law, for building railroads, but\r\nnot for farming. This must be changed, is being changed. The last ten\r\nyears have seen a revolution in this respect, and the result is a mighty\r\nincrease in agricultural educational interest.\r\n\r\nOne powerful means of agricultural education is the farmers'\r\norganization or association. All our dairy, horticultural, poultry, and\r\nlive-stock associations are great educators. So of an organization like\r\nthe Grange, its chief work is education. It brings mind in contact with\r\nmind; it gives chance for discussion and interchange of ideas; it trains\r\nin power of expression; it teaches the virtue of co-operation. Farmers\r\nblunder when they fail to encourage organization. Sometimes, out of\r\nfoolish notions of independence, they neglect to unite their forces.\r\nThey are utterly blind to their best interests when they do so. They\r\nshould encourage organization if for no other reason than for the\r\nsplendid educational advantages that flow from it.\r\n\r\nHowever, our chief interest is, perhaps, in those institutions that are\r\nformed purposely and especially for agricultural education and which are\r\nusually supported out of public funds. There are three great fields of\r\nendeavor in which these institutions are working. The first step is to\r\nknow--to know the truth. So in agriculture we must know. Know what? Know\r\nhow nature works. So the man of science studies the soil and finds out\r\nwhat plant-food it contains, how the water acts in it, what heat and air\r\ndo, and the inter-relation of all these elements. He studies the plant\r\nand its habits and tries to discover how it grows and how it can be\r\nimproved for man's use. He studies the animal and endeavors to learn\r\nwhat are the best foods for it and what laws govern its adaptation to\r\nhuman food. He studies climate and tries to find out what plants and\r\nanimals are most appropriate to different locations. He studies\r\ninjurious insects and diseases and devises remedies for them. He\r\ndiscovers, experiments. So we have research as the first term in\r\nagricultural education. The institutions of research are our experiment\r\nstations and United States Department of Agriculture. Their work may be\r\nlikened to the plowing of the field. They strive to know how nature\r\nworks, and how man can make use of her laws in the growing of plant and\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to teach. The farmer too must know. Knowledge confined\r\nto the scientist has little practical use. It is the farmer who can use\r\nit. Moreover, new teachers must be trained, new experimenters equipped,\r\nand leaders in every direction prepared. So we have agricultural\r\ncolleges and schools. If experiment is to be likened to plowing, the\r\nwork of the schools may be compared to sowing and cultivating.\r\n\r\nAgricultural colleges have been in existence in America almost fifty\r\nyears. Their careers have been both inspiring and disappointing. They\r\nhave had to train their own teachers, create a body of knowledge, break\r\ndown the bars of educational prejudice. This work has taken time. The\r\nresults justify the time and effort. For today agricultural education is\r\nbecoming organized, the subjects of study are well planned, and\r\ncompetent men are teaching and experimenting. The disappointment is\r\ntwofold. They have not graduated as many farmers as they should have.\r\nThis is due not wholly to wrong notions in the colleges. It is, as\r\nsuggested before, partly due to the lack of faith in agriculture on the\r\npart of the farmers themselves. But the colleges are in part to blame.\r\nMany of them have not been in close touch with the farmers. They have\r\noften been out of sympathy with the interests of the farmers. They have\r\ntoo frequently been servile imitators of the traditions of the older\r\ncolleges, instead of striking out boldly on a line of original and\r\nhelpful work for agriculture. Today, however, we see a rapid change\r\ngoing on in most of our agricultural colleges. They are seeking to help\r\nsolve the farmers' difficulties. They are training young men for farm\r\nlife. The farmers are responding to this new interest and are beginning\r\nto have great confidence in the colleges.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that most farmers who get an agricultural education\r\ncannot be trained in the colleges. Doubtless this is true. Probably a\r\nvery small proportion even of educated farmers can or will graduate from\r\na full course in an agricultural college. Many will do so. There is no\r\nreason why a large proportion of the graduates of our college courses in\r\nagriculture may not go to the farm. I have no sympathy with the idea\r\nthat those courses are too elaborate for those young men who want to\r\nfarm. It must be recognized, however, that even if our agricultural\r\ncolleges shall graduate hundreds and thousands every year who return to\r\nthe farm, it still leaves the great majority of farmers untouched in an\r\neducational way unless other means are devised. But there are other\r\nmeans at hand.\r\n\r\nWe have first the agricultural school. The typical agricultural high\r\nschool gives a course of two or three years, offering work of\r\nhigh-school grade in mathematics and English, with about half the time\r\ndevoted to teaching in agriculture. Many young men want to get an\r\ninsight into the principles of modern agriculture, but cannot afford\r\ntime or money for college work. This course fits their need. A splendid\r\nschool of this design has been in successful operation in Minnesota for\r\nmore than a dozen years, and has nearly five hundred students. In\r\nWisconsin there are two county schools of agriculture for a similar\r\npurpose. Other schools could be named.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural colleges also offer shorter courses of college grade,\r\nperhaps of two years. These are very practical and useful courses. Not\r\nonly that, but nearly all the colleges give special winter courses of\r\nfrom ten days to fourteen weeks. These are patronized by thousands of\r\nyoung men. So in many ways are the colleges meeting the need. We all\r\nagree that it is desirable for a young man to take a full college\r\ncourse, even in agriculture. But it is better to have a half-loaf than\r\nno bread. Yes, better to have a _slice_ than no bread. The colleges\r\nfurnish the whole loaf, the half-loaf, and the slice. And young men are\r\nnourished by all.\r\n\r\nOne reason why agricultural education has not made more rapid progress\r\nis because the children of the country schools have been taught in such\r\na manner as to lead them to think that there is no chance for brains in\r\nfarming. Both their home influence and their school atmosphere have, in\r\nmost cases perhaps, been working against their choice of agriculture as\r\na vocation. It therefore becomes important that these children shall be\r\nso taught that they can see the opportunity in farming. They must,\r\nmoreover, be so trained that they will be nature students; for the\r\nfarmer above all men must be a nature student. So we see the need of\r\nintroducing into our rural schools nature-study for the young pupils and\r\nelementary agriculture for the older ones. This is being successfully\r\naccomplished in many cases, and is arousing the greatest interest and\r\nmeeting with gratifying success. We shall within ten years have a new\r\ngeneration of young men and women ready for college who have had their\r\neyes opened as never before to the beauties of nature and to the\r\nfascination there is in the farmer's task of using nature for his own\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nBut when we have increased the attendance at our agricultural colleges\r\ntenfold; when we have hundreds of agricultural schools teaching\r\nthousands of our youth the fundamentals of agriculture; when each rural\r\nschool in our broad land is instilling into the minds of children the\r\nnearness and beauty of nature and is teaching the young eyes to see and\r\nthe young ears to hear what God hath wrought in his many works of land\r\nand sea and sky, in soil, and plant, and living animal--even when that\r\nhappy day shall dawn will we find multitudes of men and women on our\r\nfarms still untouched by agricultural education. These people must be\r\nreached. The mere fact that their school days are forever behind them is\r\nno reason why they shall not receive somewhat of the inspiration and\r\nguidance that flow from the schools. So we have an imperative demand for\r\nthe extension of agricultural teaching out from the schools to the farm\r\ncommunity. The school thus not only sheds its light upon those who are\r\nwithin its gates, but sets out on the beautiful errand of carrying this\r\nsame light into every farm home in the land. This work is being done\r\ntoday by thousands of farmers' institutes, by demonstrations in spraying\r\nand in many other similar lines, by home-study courses and\r\ncorrespondence courses, by co-operative experiments, by the distribution\r\nof leaflets and bulletins, by lectures at farmers' gatherings, by\r\ntraveling schools of dairying. These methods and others like them are\r\nbeing invoked for the purpose of bringing to the farmers in their homes\r\nand neighborhoods some of the benefits that the colleges and schools\r\nbestow upon their pupils.\r\n\r\nWe have seen something of the need of agricultural education, of the\r\nkind of education required, and of the means used to secure it. Does not\r\nthis discussion at least show the supreme importance of the question?\r\nWill not the farmers rally themselves to and league themselves with the\r\nmen who are trying to forward the best interests of the farm? Shall we\r\nnot all work together for the betterment both of the farm and of the\r\nfarmer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFARMERS' INSTITUTES\r\n\r\n\r\nA decade and a half ago, there was a vigorous campaign for the\r\nestablishment of university extension throughout the United States.\r\nGenerally speaking the campaign was a losing one--with but a few\r\nsuccesses amid general failure. But many years before this agitation,\r\nthere was begun a work among farmers, which in form and spirit was\r\nuniversity extension, and which has constantly developed until it is\r\ntoday one of the most potent among the forces making for rural progress.\r\nThis work has been done chiefly by what are now universally known as\r\nfarmers' institutes.\r\n\r\nThe typical farmers' institute is a meeting usually lasting two days,\r\nheld for the purpose of discussing subjects that relate to the interests\r\nof farmers, more particularly those of a practical character. As a rule,\r\nthe speakers to whom set topics are assigned are composed of two\r\nclasses: the first class is made up of experts, either professors or\r\nexperimenters in agricultural colleges and similar institutions, or\r\npractical farmers who have made such a study of, and such a conspicuous\r\nsuccess in, some branch of agriculture that they may well be called\r\nexperts; the second class comprises farmers living in the locality in\r\nwhich the institute is held. The experts are expected to understand\r\ngeneral principles or methods, and the local speakers the conditions\r\npeculiar to the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe meeting usually begins in the forenoon and ends with the afternoon\r\nsession of the second day--five sessions being held. As a rule, not over\r\ntwo or three separate topics are treated in any one session, and in a\r\nwell-planned institute topics of a like character are grouped together,\r\nso that there may be a fruit session, a dairy session, etc. Each topic\r\nis commonly introduced by a talk or paper of twenty to forty minutes'\r\nlength. This is followed by a general discussion in which those in the\r\naudience are invited to ask questions of the speaker relevant to the\r\ntopic under consideration, or to express opinions and give experiences\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\nThis is a rough outline of the average farmers' institute, but of course\r\nthere are many variations. There are one-day meetings and there are\r\nthree-day meetings, and in recent years the one-day meetings have grown\r\nin favor; in some states local speakers take little part; in some\r\ninstitutes a question-box is a very prominent feature, in others it is\r\nomitted altogether; in some cases the evening programme is made up of\r\neducational topics, or of home topics, or is even arranged largely for\r\namusement; in other instances the evening session is omitted. In most\r\ninstitutes women are recognized through programme topics of special\r\ninterest to them.\r\n\r\nIt is not important to trace the early history of the farmers' institute\r\nmovement, and indeed it is not very easy to say precisely when and where\r\nthe modern institute originated. Farmers' meetings of various sorts were\r\nheld early in the century. As far back as 1853 the secretary of the\r\nMassachusetts Board of Agriculture recommended that farmers' institutes\r\nbe made an established means of agricultural education. By 1871 Illinois\r\nand Iowa held meetings called farmers' institutes, itinerant in\r\ncharacter, and designed to call together both experts and farmers, but\r\nneither state kept up the work systematically. Both Vermont and New\r\nHampshire have held institutes annually since 1871, though they did not\r\nbear that name in the early years. Michigan has a unique record, having\r\nheld regularly, since 1876, annual farmers' institutes, \"so known and\r\ndesignated,\" which always have contained practically the essential\r\nfeatures of the present-day institute. The Michigan legislature passed a\r\nlaw in 1861 providing for \"lectures to others than students of the\r\nAgricultural College,\" and has made biennial appropriations for\r\ninstitutes since 1877. Ohio, in 1881, extended the institute idea to\r\ninclude every county in the state.\r\n\r\nMore important than the origin of the farmers' institute movement is the\r\npresent status. Practically every state and territory in the Union\r\ncarries on institutes under some form or other. In somewhat more than\r\nhalf the states, the authorities of the land-grant colleges have charge\r\nof the work. In the other states, the board of agriculture or the\r\ndepartment of agriculture has control.\r\n\r\nIn 1905-6 there were held 3,500 institutes, in 45 states and\r\nterritories, with a total reported attendance of 1,300,000 people, at a\r\ncost of nearly $350,000. The work is largely supported by the state\r\ntreasuries, some of the states showing a most generous spirit. The\r\nannual state appropriations for the work in leading institute states are\r\nas follows: Pennsylvania, $20,500; New York, $20,000; Minnesota,\r\n$18,000; Illinois, $17,150; Ohio, $16,747; Wisconsin, $12,000; Indiana,\r\n$10,000. In these states practically every county has annually from one\r\nto five institutes.\r\n\r\nInstitutes in no two states are managed in the same way, but the system\r\nhas fitted itself to local notions and perhaps to local needs. A rough\r\ndivision may be made--those states which have some form of central\r\ncontrol and those which do not have. Even among states having a central\r\nmanagement are found all degrees of centralization; Wisconsin and Ohio\r\nmay be taken as the extremes. In Wisconsin the director of institutes,\r\nwho is an employee of the university, has practically complete charge of\r\nthe institutes. He assigns the places where the meetings are to be held,\r\nbasing his decision upon the location of former institutes in the\r\nvarious counties, upon the eagerness which the neighborhoods seem to\r\nmanifest toward securing the institute, etc. He arranges the programme\r\nfor each meeting, suiting the topics and speakers to local needs,\r\nprepares advertising materials, and sets the dates of the meeting. A\r\nlocal correspondent looks after a proper hall for meeting, distributes\r\nthe advertising posters, and bears a certain responsibility for the\r\nsuccess of the institute. Meetings are arranged in series, and a corps\r\nof two or three lecturers is sent by the director upon a week's tour.\r\nOne of these lecturers is called a conductor. He usually presides over\r\nthe institute and keeps the discussions in proper channels. Practice\r\nmakes him an expert. The state lecturers do most of the talking. Local\r\nspeakers do not bear any large share in the programme. Questions are\r\nfreely asked, however.\r\n\r\nOhio has an institute society in each county, and this society largely\r\ncontrols its own institutes. The secretary of the State Board of\r\nAgriculture, who has charge of the system, assigns dates and speakers to\r\neach institute. After that everything is in the hands of the local\r\nsociety, which chooses the topics to be presented by the state speakers,\r\nadvertises the meeting, and the society president acts as presiding\r\nofficer. Local speakers usually occupy half the time.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem as if either of these plans in its entirety were\r\nideal--the one an extreme of centralized control, the other an extreme\r\nof local management. Yet in practice both plans work well. No states in\r\nthe Union have better institutes nor better results from institute work\r\nthan Wisconsin and Ohio. Skill, intelligence, and tact count for more\r\nthan particular institutions.\r\n\r\nNew York may be said to follow the Wisconsin plan. Minnesota goes even a\r\nstep farther; instead of holding several series of institutes\r\nsimultaneously in different parts of the state, attended by different\r\n\"crews,\" the whole corps of state speakers attends every institute. No\r\nset programmes are arranged. Everything depends upon local conditions.\r\nThis system is expensive, but under present guidance very effective.\r\nMichigan, Indiana, and Pennsylvania have adopted systems which are a\r\nmean between the plan of centralization and the plan of localization.\r\nIllinois has a plan admirably designed to encourage local interest,\r\nwhile providing for central management.\r\n\r\nFew other states have carried institute work so far as the states\r\nalready named, and in some cases there seems to be a prejudice against a\r\nwell-centralized and fully-developed system--a feeling that each\r\nlocality may be self-sufficing in institute work. But this attitude is\r\nwearing away, for experience serves to demonstrate fully the value of\r\nsystem. The danger of centralization is bureaucracy; but in institute\r\nwork, if the management fails to provide for local needs, and to furnish\r\nacceptable speakers, vigorous protests soon correct the aberration.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that in America we have no educational _system_--that\r\nspontaneity is the dominant feature of American education. This is\r\ncertainly true of farmers' institutes. So it has transpired that\r\nnumerous special features have come in to use in various\r\nstates--features of value and interest. It may be worth while to suggest\r\nsome of the more characteristic of these features, without attempting an\r\nexact category.\r\n\r\nFormerly the only way in which women were recognized at the institutes\r\nwas by home and social topics on the programme, though women have always\r\nattended the meetings freely. Some years ago Minnesota and Wisconsin\r\nadded women speakers to their list of state speakers, and in the case of\r\nWisconsin, at least, held a separate session for women, simultaneously\r\nwith one or two sessions of the regular institute, with demonstration\r\nlectures in cooking as the chief features. Michigan holds \"women's\r\nsections\" in connection with institutes, but general topics are taken\r\nup. In Ontario separate women's institutes have been organized. In\r\nIllinois a State Association of Domestic Science has grown out of the\r\ninstitutes. Thus institute work has broadened to the advantage of farm\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAt many institutes there are exhibits of farm and domestic products--a\r\nsort of midwinter fair. Oftentimes the merchants of the town in which\r\nthe institute is held offer premiums as an inducement to the farmers.\r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin an educational feature of much value takes the form of\r\nstock-judging--usually at the regular autumn fairs. The judges give\r\ntheir reasons for their decisions, thus emphasizing the qualities that\r\ngo to make up a perfect or desirable animal.\r\n\r\nIn several states there is held an annual state institute called a\r\n\"round-up,\" \"closing institute,\" or the like. It is intended to be a\r\nlargely attended and representative state convention of agriculturists,\r\nfor the purpose of discussing topics of general interest to men and\r\nwomen from the farms. These meetings are frequently very large and\r\nenthusiastic gatherings.\r\n\r\nThe county institute society is a part of the organization in some\r\ninstances very well developed. It gives permanency to the work and\r\narouses local interest and pride.\r\n\r\nThe development of men and women into suitable state speakers is an\r\ninteresting phase. As a rule the most acceptable speakers are men who\r\nhave made a success in some branch of farming, and who also have\r\ncultivated the gift of clear and simple expression. Not a few of these\r\nmen become adepts in public speaking and achieve a reputation outside of\r\ntheir own states. In several states there is held a \"normal\r\ninstitute\"--an autumn meeting lasting a week or two weeks, and bringing\r\ntogether, usually at the state college of agriculture, the men who are\r\nto give the lectures at the institutes of the winter to follow. The\r\nobject of the gathering is to bring the lecturers into close contact\r\nwith the latest things in agricultural science, and to train them for\r\nmore effective work.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the United States Department of Agriculture employed an\r\nexperienced institute director to give all his time to the study and\r\npromotion of farmers' institutes. This incident is suggestive of the\r\nimportant place which institutes have secured in the work for better\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\nThe results of a generation of institute work are not easy to summarize.\r\nIt is safe to make a broad generalization by asserting that this form\r\nof agricultural education has contributed in a remarkable degree to\r\nbetter farming. The best methods of farming have been advocated from the\r\ninstitute platform. Agricultural college professors, and agricultural\r\nexperimenters have talked of the relations of science to practical\r\nfarming. The farmers have come to depend upon the institute as a means\r\nfor gaining up-to-date information.\r\n\r\nAnd if institutes have informed, they have also done what is still\r\nbetter--they have inspired. They have gone into many a dormant farm\r\ncommunity and awakened the whole neighborhood to a quicker life. They\r\nhave started discussions, set men thinking, brought in a breath of fresh\r\nair. They have given to many a farmer an opportunity for\r\nself-development as a ready speaker.\r\n\r\nOther educational agencies, such as the agricultural colleges and\r\nexperiment stations, have profited by institutes. No one thing has done\r\nmore than the institutes to popularize agricultural education, to stir\r\nup interest in the colleges, to make the farmers feel in touch with the\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nFarmers' institutes are a phase of university extension, and it is as a\r\npart of the extension movement that they are bound to increase in value\r\nand importance. Reading-courses and correspondence-courses are growing\r\nfactors in this extension movement, but the power of the spoken word is\r\nguarantee that the farmers' institute cannot be superseded in fact. And\r\nit is worth noting again, that while university extension has not been\r\nthe success in this country which its friends of a decade ago fondly\r\nprophesied for it, its humbler cousin--agricultural college\r\nextension--has been a conspicuous success, and is acquiring a constantly\r\nincreasing power among the educational agencies that are trying to deal\r\nwith the farm problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE HESPERIA MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gulf between parent and teacher is too common a phenomenon to need\r\nexposition. The existence of the chasm is probably due more to\r\ncarelessness, to the pressure of time, or to indolence than to any more\r\nserious delinquencies; yet all will admit the disastrous effects that\r\nflow from the fact that there is not the close intellectual and\r\nspiritual sympathy that there should be between the school and the home.\r\nIt needs no argument to demonstrate the value of any movement that has\r\nfor its purpose the bridging of the gulf. But it is an omen of\r\nencouragement to find that there are forces at work designed to bring\r\nteacher and school patron into a closer working harmony. A statement of\r\nthe history and methods of some of these agencies may therefore well\r\nhave a place in a discussion of rural progress. For the movements to be\r\ndescribed are essentially rural-school movements. Of first interest is\r\nan attempt which has been made in the state of Michigan to bridge the\r\ngulf--to create a common standing-ground for both teacher and\r\nparent--and on that basis to carry on an educational campaign that it is\r\nhoped will result in the many desirable conditions which, a priori,\r\nmight be expected from such a union. At present the movement is confined\r\npractically to the rural schools. It consists in the organization of a\r\ncounty Teachers and Patrons' Association, with a membership of teachers\r\nand school patrons, properly officered. Its chief method of work is to\r\nhold one or more meetings a year, usually in the country or in small\r\nvillages, and the programme is designed to cover educational questions\r\nin such a way as to be of interest and profit to both teachers and\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nThis movement was indigenous to Michigan--its founders worked out the\r\nscheme on their own initiative, and to this day its promoters have never\r\ndrawn upon any resources outside the state for suggestion or plan. But\r\nif the friends of rural education elsewhere shall be attracted by this\r\nmethod of solving one of the vexed phases of their problem, I hope that\r\nthey will describe it as \"the Hesperia movement.\" For the movement\r\noriginated in Hesperia, was developed there, and its entire success in\r\nHesperia was the reason for its further adoption. Hesperia deserves any\r\nrenown that may chance to come from the widespread organization of\r\nTeachers and Patrons' Associations.\r\n\r\nAnd where is Hesperia? It lies about forty miles north and west of Grand\r\nRapids--a mere dot of a town, a small country village at least twelve or\r\nfifteen miles from any railroad. It is on the extreme eastern side of\r\nOceana County, surrounded by fertile farming lands, which have been\r\npopulated by a class of people who may be taken as a type of\r\nprogressive, successful, intelligent American farmers. Many of them are\r\nof Scotch origin. Partly because of their native energy, partly,\r\nperhaps, because their isolation made it necessary to develop their own\r\ninstitutions, these people believe in and support good schools, the\r\nGrange, and many progressive movements.\r\n\r\nFor several years there had existed in Oceana County the usual county\r\nteachers' association. But, because Hesperia was so far from the center\r\nof the county, and because it was not easily accessible, the teachers\r\nwho taught schools in the vicinity could rarely secure a meeting of the\r\nassociation at Hesperia; and in turn they found it difficult to attend\r\nthe meetings held in the western part of the county. A few years ago it\r\nchanced that this group of teachers was composed of especially bright,\r\nenergetic, and original young men and women. They determined to have an\r\nassociation of their own. It occurred to someone that it would add\r\nstrength to their organization if the farmers were asked to meet with\r\nthem. The idea seemed to \"take,\" and the meetings became quite popular.\r\nThis was during the winter of 1885-86. Special credit for this early\r\nventure belongs to Mr. E. L. Brooks, still of Hesperia and an\r\nex-president of the present association, and to Dr. C. N. Sowers, of\r\nBenton Harbor, Mich., who was one of the teachers during the winter\r\nnamed, and who was elected secretary of the Board of School Examiners in\r\n1887. Mr. Brooks writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     The programmes were so arranged that the participants in\r\n     discussions and in the reading of papers were about equally divided\r\n     between teachers and patrons. An active interest was awakened from\r\n     the start. For one thing, it furnished a needed social gathering\r\n     during the winter for the farmers. The meetings were held on\r\n     Saturdays, and the schoolhouse favored was usually well filled. The\r\n     meetings were not held at any one schoolhouse, but were made to\r\n     circulate among the different schools. These gatherings were so\r\n     successful that similar societies were organized in other portions\r\n     of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1892, Mr. D. E. McClure, who has since (1896-1900) been deputy\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction of Michigan, was elected\r\ncounty-school commissioner of Oceana County. Mr. McClure is a man of\r\ngreat enthusiasm and made a most successful commissioner. He conceived\r\nthe idea that this union of teachers and patrons could be made of the\r\ngreatest value, in stimulating both teachers and farmers to renewed\r\ninterest in the real welfare of the children as well as a means of\r\nsecuring needed reforms. His first effort was to prepare a list of books\r\nsuitable for pupils in all grades of the rural schools. He also prepared\r\na rural lecture-course, as well as a plan for securing libraries for the\r\nschools. All these propositions were adopted by a union meeting of\r\nteachers and farmers. His next step was to unite the interests of\r\neastern Oceana County and western Newaygo County (Newaygo lying directly\r\neast of Oceana), and in 1893 there was organized the \"Oceana and Newaygo\r\nCounties Joint Grangers and Teachers' Association,\" the word \"Granger\"\r\nbeing inserted because of the activity of the Grange in support of the\r\nmovement. Mr. McClure has pardonable pride in this effort of his, and\r\nhis own words will best describe the development of the movement:\r\n\r\n\r\n     This association meets Thursday night and continues in session\r\n     until Saturday night. Some of the best speakers in America have\r\n     addressed the association. Dr. Arnold Tompkins, in speaking before\r\n     the association, said it was a wonderful association and the only\r\n     one of its character in the United States.\r\n\r\n     What was my ideal in organizing such associations?\r\n\r\n     1. To unite the farmers who pay the taxes that support the schools,\r\n     the home-makers, the teachers, the pupils, into a co-operative work\r\n     for better rural-school education.\r\n\r\n     2. To give wholesome entertainment in the rural districts, which\r\n     from necessity are more or less isolated.\r\n\r\n     3. To create a taste for good American literature in home and\r\n     school, and higher ideals of citizenship.\r\n\r\n     4. Summed up in all, to make the rural schools character-builders,\r\n     to rid the districts of surroundings which destroy character, such\r\n     as unkept school yards, foul, nasty outhouses, poor, unfit\r\n     teachers. These reforms, you understand, come only through a\r\n     healthy educational sentiment which is aroused by a sympathetic\r\n     co-operation of farm, home, and school.\r\n\r\n     What results have I been able to discover growing out of this work?\r\n     Ideals grow so slowly that one cannot measure much progress in a\r\n     few years. We are slaves to conditions, no matter how hard, and we\r\n     suffer them to exist rather than arouse ourselves and shake them\r\n     off. The immediate results are better schools, yards,\r\n     out-buildings, schoolrooms, teachers, literature for rural people\r\n     to read.\r\n\r\n     Many a father and mother whose lives have been broken upon the\r\n     wheel of labor have heard some of America's orators, have read some\r\n     of the world's best books, because of this movement, and their\r\n     lives have been made happier, more influential, more hopeful.\r\n\r\n     Thousands of people have been inspired, made better, at the\r\n     Hesperia meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn western Michigan the annual gathering at Hesperia is known far and\r\nwide as \"the big meeting.\" The following extract from the Michigan\r\n_Moderator-Topics_ indicates in the editor's breezy way the impression\r\nthe meeting for 1906 made upon an observer:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Hesperia scores another success. Riding over the fourteen miles\r\n     from the railroad to Hesperia with Governor Warner and D. E.\r\n     McClure, we tried to make the latter believe that the crowd would\r\n     not be forthcoming on that first night of the fourteenth annual\r\n     \"big meeting.\" It was zero weather and mighty breezy. For such a\r\n     movement to succeed two years is creditable, to hold out for five\r\n     is wonderful, to last ten is marvelous, but to grow bigger and\r\n     better for fourteen years is a little short of miraculous. McClure\r\n     is recognized as the father of the movement and his faith didn't\r\n     waver a hair's breadth. And sure enough there was the\r\n     crowd--standing room only, to hear the governor and see the great\r\n     cartoonist J. T. McCutcheon of the _Chicago Tribune_. For three\r\n     evenings and two days the big hall is crowded with patrons, pupils\r\n     and teachers from the towns and country round. During the fourteen\r\n     years that these meetings have been held, the country community has\r\n     heard some of the world's greatest speakers. The plan has been\r\n     adopted by other counties in Michigan and other states both east\r\n     and west. Its possibilities are well-nigh unlimited and its power\r\n     for good is immeasurable. Everyone connected with it may well feel\r\n     proud of the success attending the now famous \"Hesperia Movement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1897, Kent County, Michigan (of which Grand Rapids is the county\r\nseat), organized a Teachers and Patrons' Association that is worth a\r\nbrief description, although in more recent years its work has been\r\nperformed by other agencies. It nevertheless serves as a good example of\r\na well-organized association designed to unite the school and home\r\ninterests of rural communities. It was for several years signally\r\nsuccessful in arousing interest in all parts of the county. Besides, it\r\nmade a departure from the Oceana-Newaygo plan which must be considered\r\nadvantageous for most counties. The Hesperia meeting is an annual\r\naffair, with big crowds and abundant enthusiasm. The Kent County\r\nassociation was itinerant. The membership included teachers, school\r\nofficers, farmers generally, and even pupils. An attempt was made to\r\nhold monthly meetings during the school year, but for various reasons\r\nonly five or six meetings a year were held. The meetings usually\r\noccurred in some Grange hall, the Grange furnishing entertainment for\r\nthe guests. There were usually three sessions--Friday evening and\r\nSaturday forenoon and afternoon. The average attendance was nearly five\r\nhundred, about one-tenth being teachers; many teachers as well as\r\nfarmers went considerable distances to attend.\r\n\r\nThe Kent County association did not collect any fees from its members,\r\nthe Teachers' Institute fund of the county being sufficient to provide\r\nfor the cost of lectures at the association meetings. Permission for\r\nthis use of the fund was obtained from the state superintendent of\r\npublic instruction. Some counties have a membership fee; at Hesperia,\r\nthe fee is 50 cents, and a membership ticket entitles its holder to a\r\nreserved seat at all sessions. The Kent County association also\r\nsuggested a reading-course for its members.\r\n\r\nThe success of the work in Kent County was due primarily to the fact\r\nthat the educators and the farmers and their leaders are in especially\r\nclose sympathy. And right there is the vital element of success in this\r\nwork. The initiative must be taken by the educators, but the plan must\r\nbe thoroughly democratic, and teacher and farmer must be equally\r\nrecognized in all particulars. The results of the work in Kent County\r\nwere thus summarized by the commissioner of schools of the county:\r\n\r\n\r\n     To teachers, the series of meetings is a series of mid-year\r\n     institutes. Every argument in favor of institutes applies with all\r\n     its force to these associations. To farmers they afford a near-by\r\n     lecture course, accessible to all members of the family, and of as\r\n     high grade as those maintained in the larger villages. To the\r\n     schools, the value is in the general sentiment and interest\r\n     awakened. The final vote on any proposed school improvement is\r\n     taken at the annual school meeting, and the prevailing sentiment in\r\n     the neighborhood has everything to do with this vote. And not only\r\n     this, but the general interest of patrons may help and cheer both\r\n     teacher and pupils throughout the year. On the other hand,\r\n     indifference and neglect may freeze the life out of the most\r\n     promising school. There is no estimating the value to the schools\r\n     in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kent County association had a very simple constitution. It is\r\nappended here for the benefit of any who may desire to begin this\r\nbeneficent work of endeavoring to draw more closely together rural\r\nschools and country homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE I.--NAME\r\n\r\n     This association shall be known as \"The Kent County Teachers and\r\n     Patrons' Association.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE II.--MEMBERSHIP\r\n\r\n     Any person may become a member of this association by assenting to\r\n     this constitution and paying the required membership fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE III.--OBJECTS\r\n\r\n     The object of this association shall be the promotion of better\r\n     educational facilities in all ways and the encouragement of social\r\n     and intellectual culture among its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IV.--MEETINGS\r\n\r\n     At least five meetings of the association shall be held each year,\r\n     during the months of October, November, January, February, and\r\n     March, the dates and places of meetings to be determined and\r\n     announced by the executive committee. Special meetings may be\r\n     called at the election of the executive committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE V.--OFFICERS\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. The officers of the association shall be a president, a\r\n     vice-president, a secretary, a treasurer, and an executive\r\n     committee composed of five members to be appointed by the\r\n     president.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2. The election of officers shall occur at the regular meeting\r\n     of the association in the month of October.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 3. The duties of each officer shall be such as parliamentary\r\n     usage assigns, respectively, according to Cushing's Manual.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 4. It shall be the duty of the executive committee to arrange\r\n     a schedule of meetings and to provide suitable lecturers and\r\n     instructors for the same on or before the first day of September of\r\n     each year. It shall be the further duty of this committee to devise\r\n     means to defray the expenses incurred for lecturers and\r\n     instructors. All meetings shall be public, and no charge for\r\n     admission shall be made, except by order of the executive\r\n     committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VI.--COURSE OF READING\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. The executive committee may also recommend a course of\r\n     reading to be pursued by members, and it shall be their duty to\r\n     make such other recommendations from time to time as shall have for\r\n     their object the more effective carrying out of the purposes of the\r\n     association.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the Oceana County plan of a set annual meeting or the Kent\r\nCounty plan of numerous itinerant meetings is the better one depends\r\nmuch on the situation. It is not improbable that itinerant meetings,\r\nwith an annual \"round-up\" meeting of the popular type as the great event\r\nof the school year, would be very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOther counties in the state have taken up the Hesperia idea. In some\r\ncases associations similar to the Kent County association have been\r\ndeveloped. More recently the work has frequently been carried on by the\r\ncounty commissioner of schools directly. \"Institutes on wheels\" have\r\nbecome a factor in the campaign for better rural schools. One\r\ncommissioner writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n     My aim has been to bring into very close relationship teachers,\r\n     patrons, and pupils. This is done, in part, in the following\r\n     manner: I engage, for a week's work at a time, some educator of\r\n     state or national reputation to ride with me on my visitation of\r\n     schools. Through the day, schools are visited, pupils' work\r\n     inspected, and in the evening, a rally is held in the locality\r\n     visited in that day. A circuit is made during the week, and Friday\r\n     evening and the Saturday following a general round-up is held. The\r\n     results of this work have been far reaching. Teachers, patrons, and\r\n     pupils are brought into close relationship and a higher standard of\r\n     education is developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form of organization matters little. The essential idea of the\r\n\"Hesperia movement\" was to bring together the teacher and the school\r\npatron on a common platform, to a common meeting-place, to discuss\r\nsubjects of common interest. This idea must be vitalized in the rural\r\ncommunity before that progress in rural-school matters which we desire\r\nshall become a fact.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to say that administrators of rural-school systems in\r\nseveral states are attempting in one way or another, and have done so\r\nfor some years, to bring together teachers and school patrons. In Iowa\r\nthere are mothers' clubs organized for the express purpose of promoting\r\nthe best interests of the schools. In many of the communities the county\r\nsuperintendent organizes excursions, and holds school contests which are\r\nlargely attended by patrons of the schools.\r\n\r\nOhio has what is known as the \"Ohio School Improvement Federation.\" Its\r\nobjects are: (1) to create a wholesome educational sentiment in the\r\ncitizenship of the state; (2) to remove the school from partisan\r\npolitics; (3) to make teaching a profession, protected and justly\r\ncompensated. County associations of the federation are being organized\r\nand the effort is being made to reach the patrons of the schools and to\r\ncreate the right public sentiment. In many of the teachers' institutes\r\nthere is one session devoted entirely to subjects that are of special\r\ninterest to the school-board members and to the patrons of the schools.\r\nEducational rallies are held in many of the townships, at which effort\r\nis made to get together all the citizens and have an exhibit of school\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, a law was passed recently to the effect that school\r\nofficers within a county may attend one educational convention a year\r\nupon call of the county superintendent. They receive therefor, three\r\ndollars for one day's services and five cents mileage each way for\r\nattendance. Already a number of very successful conventions have been\r\nheld, wherein all school districts in the counties have been\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nThe county institutes in Pennsylvania are largely attended by the public\r\nand are designed to reach patrons as well as teachers.\r\n\r\nIn Kansas, county superintendents have organized school-patrons'\r\nassociations and school-board associations, both of which definitely\r\npurpose to bring together the school and the home and the officers of\r\nthe school into one body and to co-operate with individuals for the\r\npurpose of bettering the school conditions.\r\n\r\nDoubtless other states are carrying on similar methods.\r\n\r\nAn interesting movement wholly independent of the Hesperia plan has\r\nrecently been put into operation under the leadership of Principal Myron\r\nT. Scudder of the State Normal School, New Paltz, N. Y. He has organized\r\na series of country-school conferences. They grew out of a recognized\r\nneed, but were an evolution rather than a definite scheme. The school\r\ncommissioner, the teachers, and the Grange people of the community have\r\njoined in making up the conference. An attempt is also made to interest\r\nthe pupils. At one conference there was organized an athletic league for\r\nthe benefit of the boys of the country school. The practical phases of\r\nnature-study and manual training are treated on the programme, and at\r\nleast one session is made a parents' meeting. There is no organization\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nDr. A. E. Winship, of the _Journal of Education_, Boston, had the\r\nfollowing editorial in the issue of June 21, 1906:\r\n\r\n\r\n     It is now fourteen years since D. E. McClure spoke into being the\r\n     Hesperia movement, which is a great union of educational and farmer\r\n     forces, in a midwinter Chautauqua, as it were. Twelve miles from\r\n     the railroad, in the slight village of Hesperia, a one-street\r\n     village, one side of the street being in one county and the other\r\n     side in another, for three days and evenings in midwinter each\r\n     year, in a ramshackle building, eight hundred people from all parts\r\n     of the two counties sit in reserved seats, for which they pay a\r\n     good price, and listen to one or two notable speakers and a number\r\n     of local functionaries. One-half of the time is devoted to\r\n     education and the other to farm interests.\r\n\r\n     It is a great idea, well worked out, and after fourteen years it\r\n     maintains its lustiness, but I confess to disappointment that the\r\n     idea has not spread more extensively. It is so useful there, and\r\n     the idea is so suggestive, that it should have been well-nigh\r\n     universal, and yet despite occasional bluffs at it, I know of no\r\n     serious effort to adopt it elsewhere, unless the midwinter meeting\r\n     at Shelby, in one of these two counties, can be considered a spread\r\n     of the idea. This child of the Hesperia movement, in one of the two\r\n     counties, and only twenty miles away, had this year many more in\r\n     attendance than have ever been at Hesperia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work of uniting more closely the interests, sympathies, and\r\nintelligence of the teachers and patrons of the rural school has had a\r\ntest in Michigan of sufficient length to prove that it is a practicable\r\nscheme. No one questions the desirability of the ends it is prepared to\r\ncompass, and experience in Michigan shows not only that where the\r\neducators have sufficient enterprise, tact, enthusiasm, and persistence\r\nthe necessary organizations can be perfected, but that substantial\r\nresults follow. For the sake of better rural schools, then, it is\r\nsincerely to be hoped that the \"Hesperia movement\" may find expression\r\nin numerous teachers and patrons' associations in at least the great\r\nagricultural states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE RURAL SCHOOL AND THE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the great phenomena of our time is the growth of the school\r\nidea--the realization of the part that the school plays in our\r\ncivilization and in the training of our youth for life. Our New England\r\nfathers started the school in order that their children might learn to\r\nread the Scriptures, and thus that they might get right ideas of their\r\nreligious duty. Even after this aim was outgrown, our schools for\r\ngenerations did little more than to teach the use of the mere tools of\r\nknowledge; to read, to write, and to cipher were the great gains of the\r\nschoolroom. Even geography and grammar were rather late arrivals. Then\r\ncame the idea that the school should train children for citizenship, and\r\nit was argued that the chief reason why schools should be supported at\r\npublic expense was in order that good citizens should be trained there.\r\nHistory and civil government were put into the course in obedience to\r\nthis theory. Another step was taken when physiology was added, because\r\nit was an acknowledgment that the schools should do something to train\r\nyouth in the individual art of living. Still another step was taken when\r\nmanual training and domestic science were brought into our city schools,\r\nbecause these studies emphasize the fact that the schools must do\r\nsomething to train workers. And finally we have at present the idea\r\ngaining a strong foothold that the schools must train the child to fill\r\nits place in the world of men; to see all the relations of life; to be\r\nfitted to live in human society. This idea really embraces all of the\r\nother ideas. It implies that the schools shall not only teach each\r\nindividual the elements of knowledge, that they shall train for\r\ncitizenship, that they shall train men in the art of living, that they\r\nshall aid in preparing for an occupation, but that they shall do _all_\r\nof these things, and do them not merely for the good of the individual,\r\nbut for the good of society as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is there a feeling that the pupil in school can be brought\r\ninto closer touch with the life of the community, but that the school as\r\nan institution can be made more useful to the community as a whole. This\r\ndouble thought has been expressed in the phrase, \"Make the school a\r\nsocial center,\" and practically it is being slowly worked out in\r\nnumerous city schools. How far can this idea be developed in the country\r\nschool?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this chapter is not to deal in the theory of the subject,\r\nnor to argue particularly for this view of the function of the school,\r\nbut rather to try to show some methods by which the rural school and the\r\nfarm community actually can be brought into closer relations. In this\r\nway we may perhaps indicate that there is a better chance for\r\nco-operation between the rural school and the farm community than we\r\nhave been accustomed to believe, and that this closer relation is worth\r\nstriving for. Five methods will be suggested by which the rural school\r\ncan become a social center. Some of these have already been tried in\r\nrural communities, some of them have been tried in cities, and some of\r\nthem have not been tried at all.\r\n\r\n1. The first means of making the rural school a social center is through\r\nthe course of study. It is here that the introduction of nature-study\r\ninto our rural schools would be especially helpful. This nature-study\r\nwhen properly followed approves itself both to educators and to farmers.\r\nIt is a pedagogical principle recognized by every modern teacher that in\r\neducation it is necessary to consider the environment of the child, so\r\nthat the school may not be to him \"a thing remote and foreign.\" The\r\nvalue of nature-study is recognized not only in thus making possible an\r\nintelligent study of the country child's environment, but in teaching a\r\nlove of nature, in giving habits of correct observation, and in\r\npreparing for the more fruitful study of science in later years. Our\r\nbest farmers are also coming to see that nature-study in the rural\r\nschools is a necessity, because it will tend to give a knowledge of the\r\nlaws that govern agriculture, because it will teach the children to love\r\nthe country, because it will show the possibilities of living an\r\nintellectual life upon the farm. Nature-study, therefore, will have a\r\nvery direct influence in bringing the child into close touch with the\r\nwhole life of the farm community.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much a matter of introducing new studies--the old\r\nstudies can be taught in such a way as to make them seem vital and\r\nhuman. Take, for instance, geography. It used to be approached from the\r\nstandpoint of the solar system. It now begins with the schoolhouse and\r\nthe pupils' homes, and works outward from the things that the child sees\r\nand knows to the things that it must imagine. History, writing,\r\nreading, the sciences, and even other subjects can be taught so as to\r\nconnect them vitally and definitely with the life of the farm community.\r\nTo quote Colonel Parker, who suggests the valuable results of such a\r\nmethod of teaching:\r\n\r\n\r\n     It would make a strong, binding union of the home and the school,\r\n     the farm methods and the school methods. It would bring the farm\r\n     into the school and project the school into the farm. It would give\r\n     parent and teacher one motive in the carrying out of which both\r\n     could heartily join. The parent would appreciate and judge fairly\r\n     the work of the school, the teacher would honor, dignify and\r\n     elevate the work of the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the landscape of the near-by country, the study of the\r\nstreams, the study of the soils, studies that have to do with the\r\nlocation of homes, of villages, the study of the weather, of the common\r\nplants, of domestic animals--all of these things will give the child a\r\nbetter start in education, a better comprehension of the life he is to\r\nlive, a better idea of the business of farming, a better notion about\r\nthe importance of agriculture, and will tend to fit him better for\r\nfuture life either on the farm or anywhere else, than could any amount\r\nof the old-fashioned book knowledge. Is it not a strange fact that so\r\nmany farmers will decry book knowledge when applied to the business of\r\nfarming, and at the same time set so much store by the book learning\r\nthat is given in the common arithmetic, the old-fashioned reader, and\r\nthe dry grammar of the typical school? Of course anyone pleading for\r\nthis sort of study in the rural schools must make it clear that the\r\nordinary accomplishments of reading, writing, and ciphering are not to\r\nbe neglected. As a matter of fact, pupils under this method can be just\r\nas well trained in these branches as under the old plan. The point to be\r\nemphasized, however, is that a course of study constructed on this\r\ntheory will tend to bring the school and the community closer together,\r\nwill make the school of more use to the community, will give the\r\ncommunity more interest in the school, while at the same time it will\r\nbetter prepare pupils to do their work in life.\r\n\r\n2. A second way of making the rural school a social center is through\r\nthe social activities of the pupils. This means that the pupils as a\r\nbody can co-operate for certain purposes, and that this co-operation\r\nwill not only secure some good results of an immediate character,\r\nresults that can be seen and appreciated by everyone, but that it will\r\nteach the spirit of co-operation--and there is hardly anything more\r\nneeded today in rural life than this spirit of co-operation. The schools\r\ncan perform no better service than in training young people to work\r\ntogether for common ends. In this work such things as special day\r\nprogrammes, as for Arbor Day, Washington's Birthday, Pioneer Day; the\r\nholding of various school exhibitions; the preparation of exhibits for\r\ncounty fairs, and similar endeavors, are useful and are being carried\r\nout in many of our rural schools. But the best example of this work is a\r\nplan that is being used in the state of Maine, and is performed through\r\nthe agency of what is called a School Improvement League. The purposes\r\nof the league are: (1) to improve school grounds and buildings; (2) to\r\nfurnish suitable reading-matter for pupils and people; (3) to provide\r\nworks of art for schoolrooms. There are three forms of the league, the\r\nlocal leagues organized in each school; the town leagues, whose\r\nmembership consists of the officers of the local leagues; and a state\r\nleague, whose members are delegates from the town leagues and members of\r\nthe local leagues who hold school diplomas. Any pupil, teacher, school\r\nofficer, or any other citizen may join the league on payment of the\r\ndues. The minimum dues are one cent a month for each pupil, for other\r\nmembers not less than ten cents a term. But these dues may be made\r\nlarger by vote of the league. Each town league sends a delegate to the\r\nmeeting of the state league. Each league has the usual number of\r\nofficers elected for one term. These leagues were first organized in\r\n1898 and they have already accomplished much. They have induced school\r\ncommittees to name various rural schools for distinguished American\r\ncitizens, as Washington, Lincoln, and so forth. They give exhibitions\r\nand entertainments for the purpose of raising funds. Sometimes they use\r\nthese funds to buy books for the schoolroom. The books are then loaned\r\nto the members of the league; at the end of the term this set of books\r\nis exchanged for another set of books from another school in the same\r\ntownship. In this way, at a slight expense, each school may have the use\r\nof a large number of books every year. The same thing is done with\r\npictures and works of art, these being purchased and exchanged in the\r\nsame way. Through the efforts of the league schoolhouses have been\r\nimproved, inside and out, and the school grounds improved. It is not so\r\nmuch the doing of new things that has been attempted by this league.\r\nThe important item is that the school has been _organized_ for these\r\ndefinite purposes, and the work is carried on systematically from year\r\nto year. It needs no argument to show the value of this sort of\r\nco-operation to the pupil, to the teacher, to the school, to the\r\nparents, and ultimately to the community as a whole.\r\n\r\n3. A third method is through co-operation between the home and the\r\nschool, between the teacher and pupils on one side, and parents and\r\ntaxpayers on the other side. Parents sometimes complain that the average\r\nschool is a sort of mill, or machine, into which their children are\r\nplaced and turned out just so fast, and in just such condition. But if\r\nthis is the case, it is partly the fault of the parents who do not keep\r\nin close enough touch with the work of the school. It is not that\r\nparents are not interested in their children, but it is rather that they\r\nlook at the school as something separate from the ordinary affairs of\r\nlife. Now, nothing can be more necessary than that this notion should be\r\ndone away with. There must be the closest co-operation between the home\r\nand school. How can this co-operation be brought about? Frequently\r\nparents are urged to visit the schools. This is all right and proper,\r\nbut it is not enough. There must be a closer relation than this. The\r\nteacher must know more about the home life of her pupils, and the\r\nparents must know far more about the whole purpose and spirit, as well\r\nas the method, of the school. A great deal of good has been done by the\r\njoint meeting of teachers and school officers. It is a very wise device,\r\nand should be kept up. But altogether the most promising development\r\nalong this line is the so-called \"Hesperia movement,\" described in\r\nanother chapter. These meetings of school patrons and teachers take up\r\nthe work of the school in a way that will interest both teachers and\r\nfarmers. They bring the teachers and farmers into closer touch socially\r\nand intellectually. They disperse fogs of misunderstanding. They inspire\r\nto closer co-operation. They create mutual sympathy. They are sure to\r\nresult in bringing the teacher into closer touch with community life and\r\nwith the social problems of the farm. And they are almost equally sure\r\nto arouse the interest of the entire community, not only in the school\r\nas an institution and in the possibilities of the work it may do, but\r\nalso in the work of that teacher who is for the time being serving a\r\nparticular rural school.\r\n\r\n4. A fourth method is by making the schoolhouse a meeting-place for the\r\ncommunity, more especially for the intellectual and aesthetic activities\r\nof the community. A good example of this kind of work is the John Spry\r\nSchool of Chicago. In connection with this school there is a lecture\r\ncourse each winter; there is a musical society that meets every Tuesday\r\nevening; there is a men's club that meets every two weeks to discuss\r\nmunicipal problems and the improvement of home conditions; there is a\r\nwoman's club to study for general improvement and social service; there\r\nis a mothers' council meeting every two weeks; there is a literary and\r\ndramatic society, meeting every week, composed of members of high-school\r\nage, and studying Shakespeare particularly; there is a dressmaking and\r\naid society meeting two evenings a week, to study the cutting of\r\npatterns, garment-making, etc.; a food-study and cooking club, also\r\nmeeting two evenings a week; an inventive and mechanical club, meeting\r\ntwo evenings a week, and tending to develop the inventive and mechanical\r\ngenius of a group of young men; an art club; and a boy's club, with\r\nmusic, games, reading-lessons, reading of books and magazines, intended\r\nfor boys of fourteen or fifteen years of age. These things are all\r\nunder the direction of the school, they are free, they are designed to\r\neducate. It will not be feasible for the rural school to carry out such\r\na programme as this, but do we realize how large are the possibilities\r\nof this idea of making the rural school a community center? No doubt one\r\nof the advantages of the centralized rural school will be to give a\r\ncentral meeting-place for the township, and to encourage work of the\r\ncharacter that has been described. Of course, the Grange and farmers'\r\nclubs are doing much along these lines, but is it not possible for the\r\ndistrict school also to do some useful work of this character?\r\nSinging-schools and debating clubs were quite a common thing in the\r\nrural schools forty years ago, and there are many rural schools today\r\nthat are doing work of this very kind. Is there any reason, for example,\r\nwhy the country schoolhouse should not offer an evening school during a\r\nportion of the winter, where the older pupils who have left the regular\r\nwork of the school can carry on studies, especially in agriculture and\r\ndomestic science? There is need for this sort of thing, and if our\r\nagricultural colleges, and the departments of public instruction, and\r\nthe local school supervisors, and the country teachers, and the farmers\r\nthemselves, could come a little closer together on these questions the\r\nthing could be done!\r\n\r\n5. Fifth and last, as a method for making the school a social center, is\r\nthe suggestion that the teacher herself shall become something of a\r\nleader in the farm community. The teacher ought to be not only a teacher\r\nof the pupils, but in some sense a teacher of the community. Is there\r\nnot need that someone should take the lead in inspiring everyone in the\r\ncommunity to read better books, to buy better pictures, to take more\r\ninterest in the things that make for culture and progress? There are\r\nspecial difficulties in a country community. The rural teacher is\r\nusually a transient; she secures a city school as soon as she can; she\r\nis often poorly paid; she is sometimes inexperienced; frequently the\r\nlabor of the school absorbs all her time and energy. Unfortunately these\r\nthings are so, but they ought not to be so. And we shall never have the\r\nideal rural school until we have conditions favorable to the kind of\r\nwork just described. The country teacher ought to understand the country\r\ncommunity, ought to have some knowledge of the problems that the farmers\r\nhave to face, ought to have some appreciation of the peculiar\r\nconditions of farm life. Every teacher should have some knowledge of\r\nrural sociology. The normal schools should make this subject a required\r\nsubject in the course, especially for country teachers. Teachers'\r\ninstitutes and reading-circles should in some way provide this sort of\r\nthing. This is one of the most important means of bringing the rural\r\nschool into closer touch with the farm community. Ten years ago Henry\r\nSabin, of Iowa, one of the keenest students of the rural-school problem,\r\nin speaking of the supervision of country schools, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n     The supervisor of rural schools should be acquainted with the\r\n     material resources of his district. He should know not only what\r\n     constitutes good farming, but the prevailing industry of the region\r\n     should be so familiar to him that he can converse intelligently\r\n     with the inhabitants, and convince them that he knows something\r\n     besides books. The object is not alone to gain influence over them,\r\n     but to bring the school into touch with the home life of the\r\n     community about. It is not to invite the farmer to the school, but\r\n     to take the school to the farm, and to show the pupils that here\r\n     before their eyes are the foundations upon which have been built\r\n     the great natural sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme needed to unite rural school and farm community is then,\r\nfirst, to enrich the course of study by adding nature-study and\r\nagriculture, and about these co-ordinating the conventional school\r\nsubjects; second, to encourage the co-operation of the pupils,\r\nespecially for the improvement of the school and its surroundings;\r\nthird, to bring together for discussion and acquaintance the teachers\r\nand the patrons of the school; fourth, so far as possible to make the\r\nschoolhouse a meeting-place for the community, for young people as well\r\nas for older people, where music, art, social culture, literature, study\r\nof farming, and in fact, anything that has to do with rural education,\r\nmay be fostered; and fifth, to expect the teacher to have a knowledge of\r\nthe industrial and general social conditions of agriculture, especially\r\nthose of the community in which her lot is cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE GRANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of uniting the farmers of America for any form of\r\nco-operative endeavor long ago became proverbial. The business of\r\nfarming encouraged individualism; comparative isolation bred\r\nindependence; and restricted means of communication made union\r\nphysically difficult, even among those who might be disposed to unite.\r\nIt was not strange, therefore, that the agricultural masses developed a\r\nstate of mind unfavorable for organization--that they became suspicious\r\nof one another, jealous of leadership, unwilling to keep the pledges of\r\nunion, and unable to sink personal views and prejudices.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that the farmers themselves have\r\nfailed to realize the situation, or that no genuinely progressive steps\r\nhave been taken to remedy it. During the last four decades at least, the\r\nstrongest men that the rural classes have produced have labored with\r\ntheir fellows, both in season and out of season, for union of effort;\r\nand their efforts have been by no means in vain. It is true that some of\r\nthe attempts at co-operation have been ill-judged, even fantastic. It\r\nis true that much of the machinery of organization failed to work and\r\ncan be found on the social junk-pile, in company with other discarded\r\nimplements not wholly rural in origin. But it is also true that great\r\nprogress has been made; that the spirit of co-operation is rapidly\r\nemerging as a factor in rural social life; and that the weapons of rural\r\norganization have a temper all the better, perhaps, because they were\r\nfashioned on the anvil of defeat.\r\n\r\nAmong all these efforts to unite the farming classes, by far the most\r\ncharacteristic and the most successful is the Grange. The truth of this\r\nstatement will immediately be questioned by those whose memory recalls\r\nthe early rush to the Grange, \"Granger legislation,\" and similar\r\nphenomena, as well as by those whose impressions have been gleaned from\r\nreading the periodicals of the late seventies, when the Grange tide had\r\nbegun to ebb. Indeed, it seems to be the popular impression that the\r\nGrange is not at present a force of consequence, that long ago it became\r\na cripple, if not a corpse. Only a few years ago, an intelligent\r\nmagazine writer, in discussing the subject of farmers' organizations,\r\nmade the statement, \"The Grange is dead.\" But the assertion was not\r\ntrue. The popular impression must be revised. The Grange has\r\naccomplished more for agriculture than has any other farm organization.\r\nNot only is it at the present time active, but it has more real\r\ninfluence than it has ever had before; and it is more nearly a\r\n_national_ farmers' organization than any other in existence today.\r\n\r\nThe Grange is also the oldest of the general organizations for farmers.\r\nThough the notion of organizing the farmers was undoubtedly broached\r\nearly in the history of the country, the germ idea that actually grew\r\ninto the Grange is about forty years old, and should be credited to Mr.\r\nO. H. Kelley, a Boston young man who settled on a Minnesota farm in\r\n1849. He wrote considerably for the agricultural press; and this\r\nexperience helped to bring him to the conclusion that the great need of\r\nagriculture was the education of the agriculturist. He soon came to feel\r\nthat existing agencies for this purpose--farm papers and fairs--were\r\ninsufficient. In 1866, as agent for the Department of Agriculture, Mr.\r\nKelley made a tour of the South, with the view of gaining a knowledge of\r\nthe agricultural and mineral resources of that section. On this tour he\r\nbecame impressed with the fact that politicians would never restore\r\npeace to the country; that if it came at all, it would have to come\r\nthrough fraternity. As his thought ripened he broached to friends the\r\nidea of a \"secret society of agriculturists, as an element to restore\r\nkindly feelings among the people.\"\r\n\r\nThus the Grange was born of two needs, one fundamental and the other\r\nimmediate. The fundamental need of agriculture was that farmers should\r\nbe better educated for their business; and the immediate need was that\r\nof cultivating the spirit of brotherhood between the North and the\r\nSouth. The latter need no longer exists; but the fundamental need still\r\nremains and is sufficient excuse for the Grange's existence today. Mr.\r\nKelley interested six other men in the new idea; and in December, 1867,\r\nthese \"seven founders of the order\" organized the National Grange of\r\nPatrons of Husbandry. Mr. Kelley is the only one of these seven men now\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nThus was begun a movement for organization that had resulted by 1873 in\r\nthe formation of over 20,000 Granges in 28 states, comprising not less\r\nthan 750,000 members; and in that year the National Grange, as a\r\nrepresentative body, was officially organized. For four or five years\r\nthis unexampled prosperity continued; then the reports show a feeling of\r\nweakness creeping in. In fact, the order as a whole steadily declined in\r\nnumbers and prestige during the whole of the decade following 1880. The\r\nlosses were most serious, however, in the South and West; for in New\r\nEngland and the Middle States it retained its vitality, and, indeed,\r\ngrew steadily.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifteen years there has been a widespread revival of\r\ninterest in the organization and the outlook is exceedingly promising.\r\nDuring the decade following 1890 the membership increased not less than\r\n75 per cent. During the last few years the rate of gain has been even\r\ngreater. The following table gives the official records in the five\r\nleading Grange states:\r\n\r\n\r\n     =========================================================\r\n                  |        1900          |        1905\r\n                  | ------------------------------------------\r\n                  | Granges  |  Members  | Granges  |  Members\r\n     -------------|-------------------------------------------\r\n     New York     |   550    |   43,000  |   582    |   66,500\r\n     Maine        |   275    |   29,000  |   387    |   49,000\r\n     Michigan     |   420    |   25,000  |   731    |   45,000\r\n     Pennsylvania |   526    |   20,000  |   560    |   34,000\r\n     New Hampshire|   260    |   24,000  |   263    |   28,000\r\n     ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThese states lead, but the order is also active and strong in Vermont,\r\nConnecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts. Thirty states pay dues to the\r\nNational Grange treasury, and twenty-six were represented by delegates\r\nat the last National Grange. Since 1905 there has been substantial\r\ngrowth in most of these twenty-six states, both in numbers of Granges\r\nand in membership.\r\n\r\nThe official title of the Grange is \"Patrons of Husbandry,\" of the\r\nmembers, \"Patrons,\" and of the various divisions, \"Granges.\" The\r\n\"subordinate Grange,\" or local lodge, is the Grange unit. Its area of\r\njurisdiction has, nominally, a diameter of about five miles; more\r\nroughly, \"a Grange to a township\" is the working ideal among the\r\norganizers. The membership consists of men and women, and of young\r\npeople over fourteen years of age, who may apply and by vote be\r\naccepted. Constitutionally, those whose interests are not immediately\r\nwith agriculture are ineligible to membership; and care is also\r\nexercised that only those who are of good repute shall be recommended.\r\nThe presiding officer of each Grange is the \"master;\" while among the\r\ntwelve other officers the \"lecturer\" is the most important, and\r\nvirtually acts as programme committee, with charge of the educational\r\nwork of the body. Meetings are held weekly or fortnightly. Each regular\r\nmeeting has first its business session, and then its \"lecturer's hour,\"\r\nor literary session, usually with an intervening recess for social\r\ngreetings, etc. The programmes are prepared by the lecturer, and consist\r\nof general discussions, essays, talks, debates, readings, recitations,\r\nand music; an attempt being made to suit the tastes and talents of all\r\nmembers, young and old. Many Granges have built and own their halls,\r\nwhich are usually equipped with kitchen and dining-room, in addition to\r\naudience rooms; for periodical \"feasts\" are as regular a feature of the\r\nassociation as are the initiations of new members.\r\n\r\nThe Granges of a county or other given district often organize\r\nthemselves into a \"Pomona Grange.\" The \"State Grange\" is a delegate\r\nbody, meeting annually; delegates being chosen by the subordinate and\r\nPomona Granges. The \"National Grange\" is composed of the masters of\r\nState Granges and their wives, and is also an annual gathering. The\r\nNational Grange is the legislative body of the order, and has full\r\nauthority in all matters of doctrine and practice. But to State Granges\r\nis left the determination of policy and administration for the states.\r\nThe State Granges, in turn, legislate for the subordinate Granges, while\r\nalso passing down to them ample local powers. The machinery is thus\r\nstrongly centralized, and subordinate Granges are absolutely dependent\r\nunits of a great whole. Yet the principle of home rule pervades the\r\norganization; and local associations are responsible for their own\r\nmethods and the results of their work, though their officers usually\r\nwork in harmony with the State and National Granges.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the clearest conception of what the order originally meant to do\r\ncan be gained from a few quotations from the Declaration of Purposes of\r\nthe National Grange, which was promulgated over thirty years ago, and is\r\nstill in force:\r\n\r\n\r\n     We shall endeavor to advance our cause by laboring to accomplish\r\n     the following objects:\r\n\r\n     To develop a better and higher manhood and womanhood among\r\n     ourselves. To enhance the comfort and attractions of our homes and\r\n     to strengthen our attachments to our pursuits. To foster mutual\r\n     understanding and co-operation. To maintain inviolate our laws, and\r\n     to emulate each other in labor, to hasten the good time coming. To\r\n     reduce our expenses, both individual and corporate. To buy less and\r\n     produce more, in order to make our farms self-sustaining. To\r\n     diversify our crops and crop no more than we can cultivate. To\r\n     condense the weight of our exports, selling less in the bushel and\r\n     more on hoof and in fleece; less in lint and more in warp and woof.\r\n     To systematize our work, and calculate intelligently on\r\n     probabilities. To discountenance the credit system, the mortgage\r\n     system, the fashion system, and every other system tending to\r\n     prodigality and bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n     We propose meeting together, talking together, working together,\r\n     buying together, selling together, and, in general, acting together\r\n     for our mutual protection and advancement, as occasion may require.\r\n     We shall avoid litigation, as much as possible, by arbitration in\r\n     the Grange. We shall constantly strive to secure entire harmony,\r\n     good will, vital brotherhood, among ourselves, and to make our\r\n     order perpetual. We shall earnestly endeavor to suppress personal,\r\n     local, sectional, and national prejudices, all unhealthy rivalry,\r\n     all selfish ambition. Faithful adherence to these principles will\r\n     insure our mental, moral, social, and material advancement.\r\n\r\n     For our business interests we desire to bring producers and\r\n     consumers, farmers and manufacturers, into the most direct and\r\n     friendly relations possible. Hence we must dispense with a surplus\r\n     of middle-men, not that we are unfriendly to them, but we do not\r\n     need them. Their surplus and their exactions diminish our profits.\r\n\r\n     We wage no aggressive warfare against any other interests whatever.\r\n     On the contrary, all our acts and all our efforts, so far as\r\n     business is concerned, are not only for the benefit of the producer\r\n     and consumer, but also for all other interests that tend to bring\r\n     these two parties into speedy and economical contact. Hence we hold\r\n     that transportation companies of every kind are necessary to our\r\n     success, that their interests are intimately connected with our\r\n     interests.\r\n\r\n     We are opposed to such spirit and management of any corporation or\r\n     enterprise as tends to oppress the people, and rob them of their\r\n     just profits. We are not enemies to capital, but we oppose the\r\n     tyranny of monopolies. We long to see the antagonism between\r\n     capital and labor removed by common consent, and by an enlightened\r\n     statesmanship worthy of the nineteenth century. We are opposed to\r\n     excessive salaries, high rates of interest, and exorbitant\r\n     per-cent. profits in trade.\r\n\r\n     We shall advance the cause of education among ourselves and for our\r\n     children, by all just means within our power. We especially\r\n     advocate for our agricultural and industrial colleges that\r\n     practical agriculture, domestic science, and all the arts which\r\n     adorn the home be taught in their courses of study.\r\n\r\n     We emphatically and sincerely assert the oft-repeated truth taught\r\n     in our organic law, that the Grange--national, state, or\r\n     subordinate--is not a political or party organization. No Grange,\r\n     if true to its obligations, can discuss political or religious\r\n     questions, or call political conventions, or nominate candidates,\r\n     or even discuss their merits at its meetings.\r\n\r\n     We always bear in mind that no one, by becoming a Patron of\r\n     Husbandry, gives up that inalienable right and duty which belongs\r\n     to every American citizen, to take a proper interest in the\r\n     politics of his country. On the contrary, it is his duty to do all\r\n     he can in his own party to put down bribery, corruption, and\r\n     trickery; to see that none but competent, faithful, and honest men,\r\n     who will unflinchingly stand by our industrial interests, are\r\n     nominated for all positions of trust; and to have carried out the\r\n     principle which should characterize every Patron, that the office\r\n     should seek the man, and not the man the office.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo enumerate the achievements of the Grange would be to recall the\r\nprogress of agriculture during the past third of a century. It has been\r\na motor force in many helpful movements, and in many ways has organized\r\nand incorporated the best thought of the most intelligent farmers, about\r\nmeans for rural advancement. It has been an integral part of, and a most\r\npotent factor in, the expansion of American farm life.\r\n\r\nThe greatest achievement of the order is that it has taught the farmers\r\nof America the value of co-operation and the power of organized effort.\r\nThe lesson has not been fully learned, it is true; but the success of\r\nthe institution testifies that it is possible for farmers to work in\r\nharmony. It is worth observing that this result has been achieved on\r\nconservative lines. It is comparatively easy to organize on radical\r\nlines; easy to generate enthusiasm by promising some great reform; easy\r\nto inflame self-interest by picturing millennial conditions, especially\r\nwhen the pocket is touched. But quite different is it to arouse and\r\nsustain interest in a large popular organization whose object is\r\neducation, whose watchword is self-culture. Of course, it would be but\r\na half-truth to assert that the order places all its emphasis on the\r\nsober problems of education. Agitation has had its place; the hope of\r\nbetter things for the farmer, to be achieved through legislation and\r\nbusiness co-operation, has been an inspiration to activity; but the\r\nnoteworthy fact remains that it has secured a fair degree of\r\norganization and co-operation among farmers chiefly by appeals to their\r\nlarger and nobler interests.\r\n\r\nThat the association has vastly improved the social opportunities of\r\nfarmers is a trite saying among old observers of its work. It forces\r\nisolation out of the saddle. The regular meetings of the local bodies\r\nrapidly and surely develop the social instinct among the members. Pomona\r\nGranges bring together members from all parts of the county and make\r\nthem acquainted with one another. The State Grange draws its membership\r\nfrom every corner of the state; and as its personnel changes each year,\r\nthousands are in the course of a few years given the wider outlook, the\r\nmore extended acquaintance, and the broader view that participation in\r\nsuch a gathering affords. Special social features add their influence.\r\n\r\nAs an educator on public questions the Grange has done a noble work. At\r\nnearly every meeting in this country, some topic of public concern is\r\nbrought up by essay, talk, general discussion, or formal debate. The\r\nviews of the \"village Hampdens\" may not always be economically\r\nscientific or scholarly. But it might surprise many people to see how\r\nwell read the members are and how clearly they can express their ideas.\r\nTheir discussions are not seldom informative, and that they make public\r\nopinion in rural communities is beyond cavil. The persistent advocacy of\r\nspecific reforms has directed the thought of the members toward the\r\nlarger issues that so often rise above the haze of partisan politics.\r\n\r\nThe order has prepared the soil for adequate agricultural education.\r\nWhile the agricultural colleges formerly had many enemies among the\r\nfarmers, and received scornful opprobrium from those whom they were\r\nendeavoring to help, almost without exception the Granges have praised\r\nthe colleges, welcomed their work, and urged farmers to educate their\r\nsons at these institutions. Farmers' institutes, the agricultural\r\nexperiment stations, and the federal Department of Agriculture have been\r\nequally welcomed by the Grange sentiment. The Grange has always taught\r\nthe need of better rural education. It has also tended to develop its\r\nmembers, so that they may not only appreciate education, but that they\r\nmay be themselves living examples of the value of such education.\r\nFarmers' institute lecturers frequently say, \"You can always tell when\r\nyou reach a community where a Grange exists.\" In that meeting will be\r\nfound men who have read and thought on farm and public themes, men who\r\nare not only ready in discussion, apt in statement, and eager to\r\nquestion, but men acquainted with parliamentary law, who know how such\r\nassemblages should be conducted, and who can preside with dignity and\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nThe order has undoubtedly aided materially in obliterating sectionalism.\r\nThat achievement was one of its avowed objects. There is no question but\r\nit assisted in cementing North and South; and that it has brought East\r\nand West into closer sympathy is equally true. Other farm organizations\r\nhave found their incentive in the order. These it has never frowned on,\r\nthough believing and always hoping that it might attract the majority of\r\nfarmers to its own ranks, and by this unity become a more powerful\r\nfactor in securing the rights and developing the opportunities of the\r\nrural classes of America. It has always discountenanced the credit\r\nsystem; and that cash payments by farmers to merchants are far more\r\ncommon than a quarter-century ago may be fairly credited, in part at\r\nleast, to its influence.\r\n\r\nTo describe the many specific legislative achievements which the Granges\r\nof the nation and of the several states have accomplished would be\r\ntedious. Merely to enumerate a few of them must suffice here. A\r\nconvenient summary is made from an official circular recently issued by\r\nthe National Grange. The order has had a large influence in securing the\r\nfollowing: The separation of certain agricultural colleges from\r\nuniversities which were receiving the land-grant funds, but were not, in\r\nthe opinion of the farmers, duly contributing to agricultural education;\r\nthe confining of the appropriations under the second Morrill act of 1890\r\nstrictly to instruction in agriculture and mechanical arts; the Hatch\r\nAct of 1887, establishing an experiment station in each state and\r\nterritory; making the head of the Department of Agriculture a cabinet\r\nofficial; the agitation resulting in the famous Iowa court decision,\r\nthat railroad franchises are subject to the power that created them; the\r\nestablishment of the Inter-State Commerce Commission; tax reform in\r\nmany states; laws favoring pure food and dairy products; preventing\r\nextension of patents on sewing machines; the establishment of rural free\r\nmail delivery.\r\n\r\nThe methods of work are many and varied. In addition to the regular\r\nliterary and social programmes previously mentioned, socials are held at\r\nthe homes of members, entertainments of various kinds occur at the\r\nGrange hall, and in many ways the association becomes the center of the\r\nsocial and intellectual interest of the community. It is debating\r\nsociety, club, lecture course, parliamentary society, theater, and\r\ncirculating library. In fact, it lends itself to almost any function\r\nthat will instruct, entertain, benefit, or assist its members\r\nfinancially, morally, intellectually, or socially. Of course, not every\r\nGrange is awake to its opportunities; but as a rule, where a live one\r\nexists it is the acknowledged leader in social movements.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for Granges to hold fairs for the exhibition of\r\nagricultural and domestic products. The State Fair of New Hampshire has\r\nbeen largely managed by the Grange. In many cases Granges as\r\norganizations will exhibit at the ordinary county or district fair.\r\nPicnics and field meetings are coming to be very popular in some\r\nstates. They are held during the summer season, at a time when work is\r\nleast pressing, and are usually attended by speakers of prominence in\r\nthe order. Many subordinate Granges give public lecture courses during\r\nthe winter, securing speakers on general themes. They also arrange for\r\nentertainments of a popular character.\r\n\r\nThe order also participates in activities that are not strictly Grange\r\nwork. For instance, in Michigan, the State Grange for several years\r\ncarried on a \"Fresh-Air Work,\" by which over 1,000 working-girls,\r\nchildren, and hard-working mothers with babies, from the larger cities,\r\nwere given a two-weeks' vacation in country homes. The philanthropic\r\nagencies of the cities arranged for transportation and secured the\r\nbeneficiaries, while the Grange obtained the places for them. Granges\r\nare always active in the organization of farmers' institutes,\r\nagricultural fairs, etc. In Michigan they have assisted in the\r\norganization of associations which are designed to bring together both\r\nteachers and parents for discussion of rural-school problems.\r\n\r\nOn two important matters the Grange has been misunderstood, not only by\r\nthe public, but more unfortunately, sometimes by its own members. In\r\nhis _Division and Reunion_, President Woodrow Wilson speaks of it under\r\nthe sub-title of \"New Parties.\" Professor Alexander Johnston, in his\r\n_American Politics_ was more discriminating, for he said of it: \"In its\r\nnature it is not political.\" But he also said: \"Its object is\r\nco-operation among farmers, in purchasing and in other business\r\ninterests.\" The first conception of the character of the order is wholly\r\nmisleading; the second is inadequate.\r\n\r\nThe Grange is not a party. It never was a party. During the \"Granger\r\nlegislation\" period, many members doubtless misconceived the true\r\nfunction of the Grange, and abused the power organization gave them,\r\nwhile the popular mind credited the association with many notions for\r\nwhich it was not responsible. It has never organized itself as a\r\nfarmers' party. The National Grange has endeavored to keep strictly\r\naloof from partisan politics. It is possible that in some states the\r\ninfluence of the organization was, in the early days, used for partisan\r\npurposes; but the penalty was fully paid in the disruption of the order\r\nin those states. The Grange today regards partisanship as poisonous to\r\nits life, and does not allow it on its shelves.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the Grange makes no appeal to legislation. It\r\nis possible that in some cases it places too much faith in law as a\r\nmeans of emancipation from economic bondage; but, in the main, its\r\nlegislative point of view is sane and conservative. It believes that\r\nsuch ills as are due to bad or imperfect legislation can be, at least\r\npartly, relieved by good or more perfect legislation. Nor does it limit\r\nits interest to measures that concern the farmer alone. It is\r\nunalterably opposed to class legislation, and aims to keep its own\r\nskirts clear--to avoid even the suspicion of offence in this particular.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, How does the order manage to advocate public measures\r\nwithout becoming involved in partisan squabbles? Simply by ceasing to\r\ndiscuss a question the moment it becomes a party football. For instance:\r\nthe monetary policy of the government was warmly discussed until the\r\nconventions of 1896 made it clear that it was to be a party issue.\r\nAgain: the Grange has consistently urged the construction and ownership\r\nof the Interoceanic Canal by the United States government; but it was\r\nsilent on the larger question of \"imperialism,\" not because the question\r\nwas not of importance, but because it became a subject of party\r\ncontroversy. This neutral policy as to party questions imposes certain\r\nlimitations on the influence of the organization; but experience has\r\ndemonstrated that this, more than any other thing, is responsible for\r\nthe fact that the Grange still lives and thrives.\r\n\r\nThe other misconception lies in the sentence quoted from Professor\r\nJohnston, that the Grange has for its object \"co-operation among farmers\r\nin purchasing and in other business interests;\" the implication being\r\nthat business was the chief function. It is generally admitted that in\r\nthe early days thousands joined the order \"for what there was in it;\"\r\nbelieving that the organization furnished a means for abolishing the\r\nmiddlemen, and putting ready money into the pockets of the farmers. When\r\nthese sordid souls were disillusioned, their enthusiasm went down to the\r\nzero of activity. They misunderstood, or interpreted too radically, a\r\nwell-defined, conservative, legitimate purpose of the Grange to\r\nco-operate on business lines. The order did believe that farmers could\r\ndo without the surplus of middlemen; it did purpose to aid the farmer\r\nfinancially, though this purpose was not its main function. In the\r\nearlier period Grange stores were organized. A few of these are in\r\nsuccessful operation today, but the policy as a whole has been\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nAnother plan, discussed over thirty years ago, has during the past\r\ndecade come to assume practical importance as a method of co-operation\r\non business lines. The plan, in brief, is that various State Granges\r\ncontract with manufacturing and jobbing houses to furnish members of the\r\norder with goods at practically wholesale rates. Goods are ordered by\r\nthe subordinate Granges, under seal of the order; are purchased on a\r\ncash basis; and are shipped to the purchasing agent of the Grange, and\r\nby him distributed to the individual buyers. Such materials as binder\r\ntwine, salt, harness, Paris green, all kinds of farm implements,\r\nvehicles, sewing-machines, and fruit trees are purchased advantageously.\r\nEven staple groceries, etc., are sometimes bought in this way. Members\r\noften save enough in single purchases to pay all their expenses for the\r\nGrange. There is no capital invested; there are no debts imposed upon\r\nhimself by the purchaser; and there has not been extreme difficulty in\r\nsecuring favorable contracts. The plan seems destined to continued\r\nenlargement and usefulness as a legitimate phase of business\r\nco-operation. Michigan Granges purchased not less than $350,000 worth\r\nof goods during 1905, under such a plan. The estimate for Maine is over\r\nhalf a million dollars.\r\n\r\nIn several states the organization successfully conducts mutual fire\r\ninsurance companies; active membership in the Grange being an essential\r\nrequisite for membership in the insurance company. Wherever these\r\ncompanies have become well established, it is asserted that they\r\nmaintain a lower rate of assessment than even the popular \"farmers'\r\nmutuals.\" In New York there are twenty-three Grange companies, with\r\npolicies aggregating $85,000,000, the average cost for the year 1905\r\nbeing $1.96 per thousand. Single companies claim to have secured even\r\nbetter rates. This insurance not only pays individuals, but it attracts\r\nand holds members. In New Hampshire a fairly successful Grange life\r\ninsurance company exists.\r\n\r\nIn co-operative selling, the order has so far accomplished very little,\r\nexcept locally and among individuals or Granges. There is a supreme\r\ndifficulty in the way of successful transfers among patrons themselves,\r\nas members desiring to buy wish the very lowest prices; those desiring\r\nto sell, the very highest prices. Arbitration under such circumstances\r\nis not easy. The fundamental obstacle to members selling together on\r\nthe general market is that, in most cases, all members do not have the\r\nsame things to sell. A co-operative creamery, for instance, is organized\r\non the basis of a _product_--butter; the Grange is organized on the\r\nbasis of _manhood_--and each man may have his crop or stock specialty.\r\nThis difficulty, though grave, is not, perhaps, insuperable, and will\r\ntend to disappear as membership enlarges. But it is only fair to state\r\nthat, so far, the Grange has not been able to devise any successful plan\r\nfor co-operative selling, applicable on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three features that deserve further mention. One is the\r\nposition of the family in the Grange. It is stated that the Grange was\r\nthe first secret organization to place woman on a plane of perfect\r\nequality with man. In every association each female member has a vote.\r\nWoman has four special offices assigned to her sex, and is eligible to\r\nany office in the gift of the order. The majority of subordinate\r\nlecturers are women; many subordinate and even Pomona masters are women;\r\nMichigan's state lecturer is a woman who is revolutionizing the\r\neducational work of the order in that state; while Minnesota had for\r\nsome years a competent and earnest woman as state master. Every\r\ndelegate to every State Grange is a dual delegate--man and wife. The\r\nstate master and his wife are delegates to the National Grange. Women\r\nserve on all committees in these gatherings, and a woman's voice is\r\nfrequently heard in debates. And not only the wife, but, as previously\r\nstated, the children above fourteen years of age may attain full\r\nmembership. A large proportion of every healthy Grange consists of young\r\npeople, who have their share in the active work. Thus it will be seen\r\nthat the order conserves the family life. It is doubtful if any other\r\nsocial institution in rural communities, not excepting the church, so\r\ncompletely interests the entire family.\r\n\r\nThe organization is also a conservator of morals. While sectarian\r\ndiscussions are as foreign to its purposes as is partisan politics, and\r\nwhile it does not even pretend to take the place of the church, it is\r\nbuilt on a truly religious foundation. Its ritual is permeated, in word\r\nand in sentiment, by the religious spirit. Every meeting opens and\r\ncloses with prayer. Moral character is constantly eulogized and\r\nglorified in Grange esoteric literature. The membership comes almost\r\nexclusively from that large class of farmers who are moral,\r\nhigh-minded, God-fearing men and women.\r\n\r\nThe Grange has been opposed, both by farmers and by others, because\r\nsecrecy is not a desirable attribute; but the experience of forty years\r\nand the uniform testimony of all leaders in the work declare that this\r\nwas a wise provision. No influential member has, so far as it is known,\r\nproposed that the order should be dismantled of its secret features. The\r\nritualistic work is not burdensome. Occasionally the processes of\r\ninitiation may take time that ought to be allotted to educational work;\r\nbut, if the initiation is properly conducted, it has of itself a high\r\neducational value.\r\n\r\nThe financial status of the Grange itself is worth noting. The fees for\r\njoining are merely nominal, while the dues are only ten cents a month\r\nper member. These fees and dues support the subordinate Granges, the\r\nState Grange, and the National Grange. There are no high-salaried\r\nofficials in the order, and few salaried positions of any kind. The\r\nNational Grange today has nearly $100,000 in its treasury, and several\r\nState Granges have substantial reserves. This policy is pursued, not for\r\nthe love of hoarding, but because it is believed that it tends to the\r\npermanency and solidarity of the order.\r\n\r\nThe Grange is a live institution; it has within itself the capacity for\r\nsatisfying a great need in rural society; and it is destined to growth\r\nand larger and more permanent usefulness. It is based on correct\r\nprinciples: organization, co-operation, education. It is neither a\r\npolitical party nor a business agency. It is progressively\r\nconservative--or conservatively progressive. It is neither ultra-radical\r\nnor forever in the rut. Its chief work is on cultural lines. It includes\r\nthe entire family. It is now growing, and there is every reason for\r\nthinking that this growth is of a permanent character.\r\n\r\nThe Grange is ambitious to take its place beside the school and the\r\nchurch, as one of a trinity of forces that shall mold the life of the\r\nfarmer on the broadest possible basis--material, intellectual, social,\r\nand ethical. Is there any good reason why this ambition is not worthy,\r\nor why its goal should not be won?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR FARM WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile rural life is often supposed to be fatally deficient in facilities\r\nfor growth because of its isolation, the women living on our farms are\r\nthought to be the especial victims of this lack of social opportunity.\r\nNo doubt there is much of truth in the popular opinion. Modern city life\r\nunquestionably tends to enliven, to sharpen, to put a razor-edge on\r\ncapacity. Naturally the women as well as the men of the city are thus\r\nstimulated. An instance of the opportunities constantly presented to the\r\ncity women is the rapid multiplication of women's clubs, which,\r\nespecially in smaller towns, are absolutely revolutionizing the life of\r\nwomankind. But have not the women of the country some resources of a\r\nsimilar character? Can they not in some way break the bonds of\r\nisolation? Are there not for them some of the blessings that come from a\r\nhighly organized society? Are there not, in the country also,\r\nopportunities for the co-operation of mind and heart for common service?\r\nI think all these questions can be answered in the affirmative. It is\r\nat least worth while to endeavor to describe several means by which the\r\nwoman of the farm can keep pace with her urban sister, and under\r\nconditions not so discouraging as many may suppose.\r\n\r\nProbably no movement has had such a profound significance for the farm\r\nwomen of America as has the Grange movement. We have already discussed\r\nthe general aspects of Grange work. It must be remembered that the\r\nfarmer's wife is practically equal with her husband in Grange law and\r\npractice. She votes, she may hold office, even the higher executive\r\noffices. A delegate to the State Grange is always two--a man and his\r\nwife if he has one. The wife serves on committees and votes as she\r\npleases. This equality extends throughout the order. The woman bears her\r\nshare of work; she reads papers; she directs the social phases of the\r\nGrange; she talks on farm topics if she wants to; she debates school\r\naffairs; she visits neighboring Granges. All this means education, and\r\neducation of a very valuable sort, the effects of which permeate so\r\nthoroughly those communities where the Grange has long been established\r\nthat one hardly realizes the work that has been accomplished. For it is\r\nnot at all an exaggeration to assert that a positive revolution often\r\ncomes about from the planting of a Grange in a neighborhood where no\r\nsuch organization has ever existed. It finds most of the women\r\ndiffident, many of them with restricted views, few of them with the\r\ninstinct for social service developed beyond the needs of friendly\r\nneighbors. In the Grange these women find new acquaintances, learn the\r\npower of concerted action, meet the responsibility of office, get to\r\ntheir feet for a few words--unheard-of courage! Such speech is usually\r\nbrief and perhaps not ready, but it is likely to be cogent, because it\r\nis born of experience and \"stops when through.\" County and perhaps State\r\nGranges add their experiences. And so on through the years these shy,\r\nreserved, possibly narrow, lives come to flower. And the Grange has\r\nfurnished the dynamic. Strong leaders among farm women have been\r\ndeveloped by the opportunities the Grange has afforded them. And\r\nthousands of other women in all parts of the country have by this same\r\nmeans grown out of their narrowness, \"discovered themselves,\" and become\r\ncomparatively cultured, well read, able to take a woman's place in this\r\nday of woman's power as a public factor. It is safe to say that the\r\nGrange has been the greatest single influence in America with respect to\r\nthe development of the women of the farm.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in the life of farm women which has arisen in more recent\r\nyears is the farmers' institute. The audiences in some cases are largely\r\nof men, but as a rule the attendance of women averages one-third to\r\none-half. Until very recent years the women joined with the men in all\r\nsessions of the institute, and their presence was recognized by\r\nappropriate subjects on the programme, frequently presented by women\r\nthemselves. Several years ago Minnesota and Wisconsin initiated separate\r\nmeetings for women, held simultaneously with the main meeting, for\r\npurposes of instruction in domestic science. Michigan, a little later,\r\ndeveloped the \"women's section\" of the farmers' institute. This is held\r\none afternoon of the usual two-day session of the institute in a hall\r\nseparate from the general meeting, and only women attend. Two topics are\r\npresented for discussion, one by a woman sent by the state, the other by\r\na woman from the town or a neighboring farm. Topics concerning\r\nchild-training, making housework easier, home life on the farm, and even\r\nthemes relating to the problems that center about the sex question, are\r\nthoroughly discussed. Women take part much more freely than they do in\r\nthe general sessions of the institute. Across the border, in Ontario,\r\nthe women have formed separate institutes, as they have also in Indiana.\r\n\r\nAll this means a new opportunity for the farm woman. The Grange is an\r\norganization, and its members gain all the development that comes from\r\nengaging in the work required to maintain a semi-literary and social\r\norganization. The institute, on the other hand, is an event, and there\r\ncluster about it all the inspiration and suggestion that can come from\r\nany notable convention for which one will sacrifice not a little in\r\norder to attend. Institute work for women is in its beginnings.\r\n\r\nSo far we have found that existing institutions for women in rural\r\ndistricts bring together merely the women of the farm. In the women's\r\nsection of the institutes half the audience is usually from the town.\r\nThis meeting occurs, however, but once a year, and the social effect of\r\nthe commingling of city and farm women can prove only suggestive of the\r\ndesirability of further opportunity for similar gatherings. At a\r\nMichigan institute some years ago this desire fructified, and the\r\nproduct was a \"Town and Country Club.\" This club secured a majority of\r\nits membership, of some ninety, from among women residing on farms. Its\r\nmeetings are bi-weekly. It is to be hoped that this sort of club may be\r\norganized in large numbers. It represents another step in the\r\nemancipation of the farm woman, because it brings her into contact with\r\nher city sister--and contact that is immediate, vital, inspiring,\r\ncontinuous, and mutually helpful. It may be thought unnecessary to form\r\na new set of clubs for the purpose indicated, but the fact seems to be\r\nthat the ordinary women's club even in small towns has failed to reach\r\nthe woman who makes her home upon the farm.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of this idea of the Town and Country Club is the \"rest\r\nroom\" for farmers' wives. In a number of cases where this has been\r\ntried, the women of the village or town provide a room as near the\r\nshopping center of the town as possible, where the country women can\r\nfind a place to rest, to lunch, and to leave their children. These rooms\r\nare fitted up in a neat but inexpensive manner with the necessary\r\nconveniences, and are entirely free to those for whom they were\r\nintended. If these rooms are well managed, they offer not only a very\r\npractical form of assistance to the women of the farm, but they may be\r\nthe means of developing a form of co-operation between the women of the\r\nvillage and the farm, and eventually leading to some permanent scheme of\r\nmutual work. Possibilities of this sort of thing are easily recognized.\r\n\r\nIn the realms of higher education the girl who is to stay upon the farm\r\nhas not been wholly neglected. In Kansas, Iowa, Connecticut, Illinois,\r\nOhio, and Michigan, at least, and in connection with the agricultural\r\ncolleges of those states, courses for women (including domestic science)\r\nhave been provided. They are well patronized by girls from the farm.\r\nMany of these girls do not marry farmers; many of them do. And their\r\ncollege training having thus been secured in an atmosphere more or less\r\nagricultural, they must inevitably take rank among their sisters of the\r\nfarm as leaders in demonstrating what farm life for women may be.\r\n\r\nNor should it be forgotten that the tremendous movement of recent years\r\nwhich has so multiplied standard reading-matter, both periodicals and\r\nbooks, has reached the farm. A census of country post-offices will\r\nreveal the fact that the standard magazines go regularly to thousands\r\nof farm homes. Agricultural papers, religious papers, and even dailies\r\nfind multitudes of intelligent readers among farmers.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of better highways, electric car lines, rural free\r\ndelivery, and the rural telephone, each of which is looming on the\r\nhorizon as an important feature of American farm life; with the Grange\r\nor similar organization in every school district; with the development\r\nof courses for women at all our colleges of agriculture, and the logical\r\ncomplement of such courses in the form of college extension--farmers'\r\ninstitutes, reading-courses, traveling libraries, lecture and\r\ncorrespondence courses--we shall find farm life taking on a new dress,\r\nand perhaps farmers' wives may come to enjoy the envy of those women who\r\nare unfortunate enough not to have married farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY CHURCH AND PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only way to an understanding of the relation of the church to rural\r\nprogress is through an appreciation of the place which the church as a\r\nsocial institution may have among other social institutions affecting\r\nrural life. Moreover, to know the value of these institutions one must\r\nfirst know the rural social needs. May we not then, even at the risk of\r\nrepetition, take a brief survey of these needs and institutions, in\r\norder that we may more clearly attain the proper point of view?\r\n\r\nAt the outset let us be sure that we have sympathy with the countryman\r\nas such. It is often argued that the rural question, or any phase of it,\r\nas for instance the question of the rural church, is important because\r\nthe country supplies the best blood to the city--and a roll-call of the\r\nfamous country-born is read to prove the point. This may be all true.\r\nBut it is only a partial view, for it places the emphasis upon the\r\nleaving of the farm, whereas the emphasis should be placed upon the farm\r\nand those who stay there. We may praise the country because it\r\nfurnishes brain and brawn for the world's work; we may argue for country\r\nlife because it possesses a good environment in which to rear a family;\r\nwe may demand a school system that shall give the country child as good\r\na chance as the city child has. In all this we do well. But we do not\r\nyet stand face to face with the rural problem.\r\n\r\nFor the rural problem is the problem of those who farm. It is the\r\nproblem of the man behind the plow. It is he that is the center of\r\ninterest. His business, his success, his manhood, his family, his\r\nenvironment, his education, his future--these constitute the problem of\r\nthe farm. Half our people make their living from the brown soil. In\r\nvirtue, in intelligence, in real worth, this half compare favorably with\r\nthe other half who saw wood, and shovel sand, and pull throttles, and\r\nprepare briefs, and write sermons. The business of agriculture provides\r\ndirectly for the material welfare of nearly forty millions of our\r\npeople. It supports gigantic railway systems, fills the hulls of immense\r\nships, furnishes raw material for thousands of industries. This rural\r\nhemisphere of American economic and social life is surely worthy the\r\nthought of the captain of industry, of the statesman, of the economist,\r\nof the educator, of the preacher. We may also, without danger of being\r\nput to confusion, assume that the tiller of the soil is in essential\r\ncharacter very much like other people. Farmer nature is usually a fair\r\nspecimen of human nature. Nevertheless the environment of the farmer is\r\na peculiar one. Individually as well as socially he is comparatively\r\nisolated. He meets but little social friction. The class to which he\r\nbelongs is largely a segregated class, physically and socially.\r\n\r\nAll these things give to the rural social problem a distinctive\r\ncharacter and give rise to the great social needs of the farmer. What\r\nare these needs? I name three: (1) _Completer organization._ Farmers do\r\nnot co-operate easily. They never had to co-operate largely under the\r\nold regime, for pioneer farming placed a premium on individualism. The\r\npresent century however, with its emphasis upon organization and\r\nco-operation, calls the farmer to the task with the warning cry that\r\nunless he does organize he is in danger of losing his present\r\nindustrial, political, and social status. (2) _Better education._ The\r\nrural schools may not be so deficient as to deserve all the scorn heaped\r\nupon them by educational reformers; but it is little enough to say that\r\nthey can be vastly improved. They are not keeping up with city schools.\r\nThe country is especially lacking in good high-school privileges. Of\r\ntechnical training too, in spite of forty years of agricultural\r\ncolleges, the country is sadly in need. Neither in primary grades, in\r\nhigh schools, in special schools, is there an adequate amount of study\r\nof the principles of agriculture--principles which an age of science\r\ndemands must be mastered if the independent farmer is to be a success.\r\n(3) _Quicker communication._ Isolation has been the bugbear of farm\r\nlife. It must be overcome partly by physical means. There must be a\r\ncloser touch between individuals of the class, and between farmers and\r\nthe dwellers in the town and city.\r\n\r\nThese social needs are in some degree met by the farmers' organizations,\r\nby the rural and agricultural schools, and by the development of new\r\nmeans of communication. There is a host of minor agencies. In other\r\nchapters I have tried to show how these various institutions are\r\nendeavoring to meet these rural needs. So important are these factors of\r\nrural life that we may now raise the question, What should be the\r\nrelation of the rural church to these needs and to the agencies designed\r\nto meet them? In dealing with this phase of the subject, we may best\r\nspeak of the church most frequently in terms of the pastor, for reasons\r\nthat may appear as we go on.\r\n\r\nThere are three things the country pastor may do in order to bring his\r\nchurch into vital contact with these great sociological movements. Of\r\ncourse he _may_ ignore them, but that is church suicide. (1) He may\r\nrecognize them. This means first of all to understand them, to\r\nappreciate their influence. There is a law of the division of labor that\r\napplies to institutions as well as to individuals. This law helps us to\r\nunderstand how such institutions as the Grange and farmers' institutes\r\nare doing a work that the church cannot do. They are doing a work that\r\nneeds doing. They are serving human need. No pastor can afford to ignore\r\nthem, much less in sneer at them as unclean; he may well apply the\r\nlesson of Peter's vision, and accept them as ministers of the kingdom.\r\n(2) He may encourage and stimulate them. The rural pastor may throw\r\nhimself into the van of those who strive for better farming, for a\r\nquicker social life, for more adequate educational facilities. He can\r\nwell take up the role of promoter--a promoter of righteousness and peace\r\nthrough so-called secular means. Thus shall he perform the highest\r\nfunction of the prophet--to spiritualize and glorify the common. But the\r\nrural pastor can go even farther. (3) He may co-operate with them. He\r\nmay thus assist in uniting with the church all of those other agencies\r\nthat make for rural progress, and thus secure a \"federation,\" if not \"of\r\nthe world,\" at least of all the forces that are helping to solve the\r\nfarm problem; and he may thus found a \"parliament,\" if not \"of man,\" at\r\nleast of all who believe that the rural question is worth solving and\r\nthat no one movement is sufficient to solve it.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the most practical part of our subject, which is, how the\r\nproposed relation between church and other rural social forces may be\r\nsecured. There are four suggestions along this line.\r\n\r\n1. Sociological study by the rural pastor. This is fundamental. In\r\ngeneral it means a fairly comprehensive study of sociological\r\nprinciples, some study of sociological problems, and some practice in\r\nsociological investigation. As it relates to the rural pastor, it means\r\nalso a knowledge of rural sociology. It implies a grasp of the\r\nprinciples and significance of modern agricultural science, an\r\nunderstanding of the history, status, and needs of rural and\r\nagricultural education, an appreciation of and sympathy for the\r\nco-operative movements among farmers. Does one say, this is asking too\r\nmuch of the burdened country pastor with his meager salary and\r\nwidespread parish? Let me ask if the pastor has any other road to power\r\nexcept _to know_? Moreover, the task is not so formidable as first\r\nappears. The pastor is supposed to be a trained student, and since he\r\nneeds to know these things only in broad lines, the acquiring of them\r\nneed not compel the midnight oil. I would, however, urge that every\r\npastor have a course in general sociology, either in college or in\r\nseminary, and if he has the slightest intimation that his lines will be\r\ncast in country places, that he add a course in rural sociology.\r\nInasmuch as the latter course is at present offered in few academic\r\ninstitutions in the United States, it might well be urged that brief\r\ncourses in rural sociology be offered at the many summer schools.\r\n\r\nBut sociological study by the pastor means more than knowledge of the\r\ngeneral principles of sociology and of the problems of rural sociology;\r\nit means a minute and comprehensive sociological study of his particular\r\nparish. This in its simplest form consists of a religious canvass such\r\nas is frequently made both in country and city. But even this is not\r\nenough. It should at once be supplemented by a very careful and indeed a\r\ncontinuous sociological canvass, in which details about the whole\r\nbusiness and life of the farm shall be collected and at last assimilated\r\ninto the vital structure of the pastor's knowledge of his problem.\r\n\r\n2. The second suggestion looks toward the establishment of a\r\nsocial-service church, or an institutional church, or again, as one has\r\nphrased it, a \"country church industrial.\" There seems to be a growing\r\nfeeling that the country church may become not only the distinctively\r\nreligious center of the neighborhood, but also the social, the\r\nintellectual, and the aesthetic center. No doubt there is untold power\r\nin such an idea. No doubt the country church has a peculiarly rich and\r\ninviting field for community service. It would be gratifying if every\r\ncountry pastor would study the possibilities of this idea and endeavor\r\nto make an experiment with it. I have, however, a supplemental\r\nsuggestion, at this point. It is not possible to make of every rural\r\nchurch an institutional church. The church is notably a conservative\r\ninstitution. The rural church is in this respect \"to the manner born.\"\r\nRural church members are likely to be ultra-conservative, especially as\r\nto means and methods. Even if this were not true, we might well lament\r\nany attempt to establish a social-service church that endeavored to make\r\nthe church the sole motive power in rural regeneration, that failed to\r\nrecognize, to encourage, and to co-operate with the other social forces\r\nwhich we have mentioned. But if every country pastor cannot have a\r\nsocial-service church, is it not possible that every country church\r\nshall have a social-service pastor? There are some things the church\r\ncannot _do_; there is nothing it may not through its pastor _inspire_.\r\nThere are some uses to which the country church cannot be put; there are\r\nno uses to which the country pastor may not be put--as country pastors\r\nknow by experience. The pastor ought to be an authority on social\r\nsalvation as well as on personal salvation. He ought to be guide,\r\nphilosopher, and friend in community affairs as well as in personal\r\naffairs. Is he not indeed the logical candidate for general social\r\nleadership in the rural community? He is educated, he is trained to\r\nthink, he is supposed to have broad grasp of the meaning of affairs, he\r\nusually possesses many of the qualities of leadership. He is\r\n_relatively_ a fixture. He is less transient than the teacher. He is the\r\nonly man in the community whose tastes are sociological and who is at\r\nthe same time a paid man--all this aside from the question of the\r\nmunificence of his stipend. Let us then have the social-service rural\r\nchurch if we can; but let us have the social-service rural pastor at all\r\nhazards, as the first term in the formula for solving the sociological\r\nproblem of the country church.\r\n\r\n3. Co-operation among rural churches. The manifest lack of co-operation\r\namong churches seems to many laymen to result in a tremendous waster of\r\npower. Of course it is a very hard problem. But is it insoluble? It\r\nwould seem not. One would think that the plan of union suggested by Dr.\r\nStrong in _The New Era_ is wholly practicable. But the burden of the\r\nsuggestion at this point is this: Cannot the churches unite sufficiently\r\nfor a thorough religious and sociological canvass? If they cannot\r\nfederate on a theological platform, can they not unite on a statistical\r\nplatform? If they cannot unite for religious work, can they not join\r\nhands long enough to secure a more intelligent basis for their separate\r\nwork? It seems to me that this sort of union is worth while, and that it\r\nis something in which there could be full union, in which \"there is\r\nneither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free.\"\r\n\r\n4. The pastor may aid if not lead in the federation of rural social\r\nforces. The idea involved is substantially this: Given a farmers'\r\norganization that ministers chiefly to industrial and economic ends,\r\nthough incidentally to moral and educational ones; a school system that\r\nfeeds chiefly the accepted educational needs, though acting perhaps as a\r\nmoving force in industrial and social betterment; a church which is\r\nchiefly a religious institution, but which touches the life of the\r\ncommunity at many other points--given these things and the obvious next\r\nstep is co-operation among them all, in order that a well-balanced kind\r\nof social progress may result. This form of federation means the attempt\r\nto solve the farm problem at all points. It suggests that the army of\r\nrural progress shall march with the wings abreast the center. It means\r\nthat the farmer, the editor, the educator, the preacher--all, shall see\r\nthe work that needs doing, in all its fulness, and, seeing, shall\r\nresolve to push ahead side by side.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: The rural problem is a neglected but exceedingly important\r\nquestion. Out of the peculiar environment of the farmer grow his\r\npeculiar social needs, namely, better organization, fuller and richer\r\neducation, quicker communication. To meet these supreme needs we find a\r\ngrowing and already powerful coterie of farmers' organizations, somewhat\r\nheterogeneous but rapidly developing plans of agricultural education,\r\nand a marvelous evolution of the means of transportation for body,\r\nvoice, and missive. These needs and these agencies are selected as the\r\nconspicuous and vital element in the sociological problem that confronts\r\nthe rural pastor. What shall be his attitude toward them? He _may_\r\nignore them; but we assume that he will seek to work with them and to\r\nuse them for the greater glory of God. He must then recognize them,\r\nencourage them, and co-operate with them. To do this successfully he\r\nmust first be a student of sociology; he can then well afford to\r\nmeditate upon the possibilities of making his church in some measure a\r\nsocial-service church or at least of making of himself a social-service\r\npastor; he can work for church union at least on sociological lines; and\r\nfinally he can do his best to secure an active federation of all the\r\nforces involved in the rural problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY OF RECENT PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some respects the most notable recent advance in rural matters\r\nconsists in the improved means of communication in rural districts. The\r\ncountry is relatively isolated, and it is this isolation in its extreme\r\nforms that is the bane of country living. Undue conservatism, lack of\r\nconformity to progressive views, undue prominence of class feeling, and\r\na tendency to be less alert are things that grow out of this isolation;\r\nbut better means of communication decrease these difficulties, and the\r\nlast few years have seen a remarkable advance in this respect. For\r\ninstance, the rural free mail delivery system is only ten years old, and\r\nyet today there are more than twenty-five thousand routes of this\r\ncharacter in the United States serving possibly twenty million people\r\nwith daily mail, a great proportion of whom before had very irregular\r\nmail service. Results are patent and marked. Time is saved in going for\r\nmail; market reports come daily; farmers are more prompt in their\r\nbusiness dealings; roads are kept in better shape; there is an\r\nincreased circulation of papers and magazines. Thus the farmer is in\r\ncloser touch with affairs and much more alert to business opportunities,\r\nto political activities, and to social movements. The circulation of\r\ndaily papers in country districts has increased at a marvelous rate. The\r\namount of letter-writing has increased. Rural delivery of mail arouses\r\nthe spirit of \"being in the world.\" Its results have been almost\r\nrevolutionary.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the rural telephone. Recent investigation in the states of\r\nOhio, Michigan, and Indiana showed that out of 200,000 subscribers to\r\nthe independent telephone companies of those states about one-sixth were\r\nin farm homes. A few years ago, hardly a telephone could be found in a\r\nfarmer's family. This business is constantly increasing. The established\r\ntelephone companies are pushing their work into the country districts,\r\nsmall local exchanges are being formed, and soon the farmers, in the\r\nNorth at least, will be almost as well served by the telephone as are\r\npeople of the smaller cities.\r\n\r\nInterurban electric railways are being built very rapidly and their\r\nadvantage to the farmer is obvious. It is doubtful if their effect has\r\nbeen quite so far-reaching as some have suggested. At present they very\r\nlargely parallel existing steam railways, and while they give better\r\nfreight and passenger service and assist materially in diminishing rural\r\nisolation in the areas which they traverse, their influence does not\r\nextend very far from the line itself, and they reach relatively small\r\nareas of the country. However, their value to the farmer is very large,\r\nand, as they increase in number and in efficiency of service, they will\r\nbecome a powerful factor in rural progress.\r\n\r\nThe good-roads movement is beginning to take on large proportions. It\r\nis, however, a complicated question. To make first-class roads is a\r\ncostly business, and while a few such roads are of great value in a\r\ngeneral social way, they do not quite make general country conditions\r\nideal. To accomplish this, every road in the country should be a good\r\nroad the year through, and this is an ideal very difficult of\r\nrealization. However, in general, the roads are improving and as rapidly\r\nas the wealth of the country will permit the road system of the United\r\nStates will be developed. Of course, good roads are a prime requisite\r\nfor rural betterment.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that during the past decade the improvement\r\nof means of communication in rural districts has gone forward at a\r\nmarvelously rapid pace. Nor is it exaggerating to say that the movements\r\nnamed are re-creating farm life.\r\n\r\nDuring this same period, there has been an almost equally wonderful\r\nadvance in the means of agricultural education. Just twenty years ago\r\nthe experiment-station system of this country was established. It took\r\nten years for the stations to organize their work and to gain the\r\nconfidence of the farmers. At present however, they are looked upon with\r\ngreat favor by the farming class and are doing a magnificent work. Their\r\nfunction is that of research chiefly, although they attempt some control\r\nservice, such as inspection of fertilizers, stock foods, etc. In\r\nresearch they aim both to study the more intricate scientific questions\r\nthat relate to agriculture and to carry on experiments that are of more\r\nobvious and more immediate practical application to existing conditions\r\nin the various states. There is one of these stations in each state and\r\nterritory, besides a number of stations supported by state funds. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture at Washington has also developed during the\r\nlast ten years until it is performing very large service for\r\nagriculture. Its annual expenditures aggregate eight or ten million\r\ndollars, and it has in its employment hundreds of experts carrying on\r\nlaboratory and field research, scouring the world for plants and seeds\r\nthat may be of economic value, and assisting to control plant and animal\r\ndiseases. It is also distributing a vast amount of practical\r\ninformation, put in readable form and adapted to the average farmer. Its\r\nwork of seeking to extend the markets of our agricultural products is\r\none of its notable successes.\r\n\r\nAgricultural schools have been talked about for a century, and during\r\nthe early part of the last century several were started. The first\r\npermanent agricultural college was opened in 1857, in Michigan. The\r\nMorrill Act of 1862 gave rise to a system of such colleges and today\r\nthere will be found one in every state and territory, besides several\r\nfor the colored people of the South. Up to 1890, these colleges had been\r\nnot wholly satisfactory and the farming class was not patronizing very\r\nfully their agricultural courses. The fault belonged both to the college\r\nand to the farmers. The farmers were skeptical of the value of\r\nagricultural education, and the colleges were often out of sympathy with\r\nthe real needs of the farmers, and in fact found it difficult to break\r\naway from the pedagogical ideals of the old educational regime. Since\r\n1890, however, there has been a complete change of sentiment in this\r\nrespect, particularly in the Middle West. There the \"land-grant\"\r\ncolleges, whether separate colleges or whether organized as colleges of\r\nstate universities, are securing magnificent buildings for agriculture,\r\nare offering fully equipped courses, and are enrolling as students some\r\nof the best men in college, whom they are educating not only for\r\nagricultural teachers and experimenters but also for practical farmers.\r\nOf course, there are many grave problems connected with this subject,\r\nmany farmers who do not yet respond to the call for educated\r\nagriculturists, and some colleges that do not yet appreciate their\r\nopportunity. But the change for the better has been so marked that all\r\nagricultural educators are extremely optimistic.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult and most important phases of agricultural\r\neducation is that of a secondary grade. The great proportion of educated\r\nfarmers will probably be trained for their business in secondary\r\nschools. This problem is being approached from many standpoints. The\r\nUniversity of Minnesota established, some fourteen years ago, a school\r\nof agriculture, which now enrols several hundred pupils of both sexes.\r\nWisconsin is trying the experiment of two county schools of agriculture.\r\nOccasionally the public high school will be found offering a course in\r\nagriculture. Several states are experimenting in one or more of these\r\nlines, and during the next few years we shall see a large development of\r\nthis phase of agricultural education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting movements in agricultural education has been\r\nan attempt to introduce nature-study and even the elements of\r\nagriculture into the country schools. Cornell University has taken the\r\nlead in advocating \"nature-study\" purely, for the schools; and the\r\nUniversity of Missouri has perhaps been the leader in advocating that\r\nthe work be made even more definite and practical, and that the country\r\npupils shall be taught, during their early years even, \"the elements of\r\nagriculture.\" Both plans are being worked out with a fair degree of\r\nsuccess, and many other states are carrying out the work in some form or\r\nother. Of course the idea is not a new one, but its present practical\r\napplication is a timely one, and it will not be long before this branch\r\nof agricultural education will become a prominent factor in rural\r\nbetterment.\r\n\r\nA most suggestive phase of agricultural education is college extension\r\nwork. University extension has had a rather meteoric career in this\r\ncountry, in so far as it has been connected with educational\r\ninstitutions; although the extension idea is spreading rapidly and is\r\nbeing worked out through home study and correspondence courses of all\r\nsorts. But I think there is scarcely any field in which the real college\r\nextension idea is today being more successfully applied than in\r\nagriculture. The work started with farmers' institutes, which were\r\ninstituted about twenty-five years ago and which have been adopted in\r\npractically all the states of the Union. It has broadened within ten\r\nyears, until now it is carried on not only by farmers' institutes, but\r\nthrough home-correspondence courses, the introduction of millions of\r\npamphlets into farm homes, demonstrations in spraying, butter-making,\r\nsoil testing, milk testing, and so on.\r\n\r\nOntario presents a good illustration of how a new agriculture can be\r\ncreated, in a dozen years, by co-operating methods of agricultural\r\neducation. Her provincial department of agriculture, her experiment\r\nstation, her agricultural college, her various forms of extension work,\r\nand her various societies of agriculturists have all worked together\r\nwith an unusual degree of harmony for the deliberate purpose of inducing\r\nCanadian agriculturists to produce the things that will bring the most\r\nprofit. The results have been most astonishing and most gratifying.\r\n\r\nThe recent progress in the organization of farmers has been less marked\r\nthan has been the development of rural communication and agricultural\r\neducation. Organization is a prime requisite for farmers. They feel this\r\ntruth themselves. For the last forty years, many attempts--some large,\r\nsome small, some successful, some great failures--have been made to this\r\nend. The problem is an extremely difficult one. Business co-operation\r\namong farmers is especially difficult and, while co-operation has\r\ndeveloped quite largely--so much so that the Department of Agriculture\r\nwas able to report, a year ago, a list of five thousand co-operative\r\nsocieties of various kinds among farmers--still it cannot be said that\r\nthe farmers are co-operating industrially in a relatively large way.\r\nThey have, however, a multitude of associations and societies. They have\r\nalso the Grange, which is the most successful of all the general\r\norganizations of farmers in the country. Contrary to public belief, the\r\nGrange is not defunct, but has been growing at a very rapid pace during\r\nthe last few years and has a large influence especially in the East and\r\nMiddle West. It has practically no existence in the far West and in the\r\nSouth. It has a national organization, however, representing some\r\ntwenty-six states. Its influence in Congress is said to be marked. The\r\nlocal Granges are doing a very large work, socially, educationally, and\r\nsometimes financially. The Grange seems to understand itself now. Its\r\nideals have been worked out pretty carefully, and its future growth is\r\nquite certain.\r\n\r\nWe have suggested that the significant rural social movements of the\r\npast few years have been the improvement of rural communication, the\r\nwonderful development of agricultural education, and the fairly\r\nsatisfactory development of organization among farmers. It seems also\r\napparent that there is a fourth line of development that might be\r\nmentioned as being significant, and it may be expressed in a somewhat\r\ngeneral statement that the interest in agricultural questions has\r\nincreased in a very marked way. There is undoubtedly a new emphasis upon\r\ncountry life generally. The people of the cities have been going to the\r\ncountry more than ever before. A walk, the length of Beacon Street in\r\nBoston, at any time from the middle of June to late autumn, convinces\r\none that the majority of the people are somewhere in the country. All\r\nover the North, city people are making country homes for at least a\r\nportion of the year. There is also a growing interest in the farm and\r\nfarm problems among the general public. Just now the country schools are\r\nattracting special attention from the educators--so much so that the\r\nlate President Harper stated, not long ago, that the rural-school\r\nquestion is the coming question in education. Even the country church is\r\nbeing made a subject of discussion in religious circles. It is conceded\r\nthat agriculture presents \"problems.\" And while the throbbing, busy,\r\nintense life of the city brings perplexing questions to our\r\ncivilization, our people are coming to realize that the agricultural\r\npopulation and the agricultural industry are still tremendous factors in\r\nour national life and success, and that both social and industrial\r\nconditions in the country are such that there also are grave questions\r\nto be settled.\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts which have been given, I think if one were asked to\r\ngive a direct answer to the question, Is the farmer keeping up? one\r\ncould reply, Yes. In some sections of the country, the farmers have not\r\nresponded to these forward movements. The countryman is naturally\r\nconservative. Not only that, but there are some serious questions that\r\nhe has to meet in his business and in his life. He finds it extremely\r\nand increasingly difficult to get adequate labor. He has not been able\r\nto take sufficient advantage of the power of co-operation. The\r\nindustrial and social development of the city has lured away his\r\nchildren. And yet one cannot help feeling that these really remarkable\r\nadvances of the past decade are prophetic of a steady improvement in\r\nrural conditions, of a larger development of rural life, of a greater\r\nprosperity for agriculture.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the future, it seems to me that, on the social side, the\r\nprogress of the next few years is to be along the lines, indicated\r\nabove, which have characterized the past ten or a dozen years. Still\r\nfurther improved means of communication will tend to banish isolation\r\nand its drawbacks. Realization of the benefits of organization and\r\nability to co-operate will vastly strengthen class power. The means of\r\nagricultural education will be developed very rapidly, with the ideal in\r\nmind of being able to furnish some sort of agricultural training for\r\nevery individual who lives upon the farm. The country question, as a\r\nwhole, will attract increasing attention. Gradually it will be seen that\r\nthe rural problem is one of the greatest interest to all our citizens.\r\nThe spirit of co-operation will grow until not only the farmers\r\nthemselves unite for their own class interests but the various social\r\nagencies--industrial, religious, educational--ministering to rural\r\nbetterment will find themselves also co-operating. Thus, it seems to me,\r\nthe outlook for the future is full of hope. A genuine forward movement\r\nfor rural betterment has had its beginning, is now gathering volume, and\r\nwill soon attain very large proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORWARD STEPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL SIDE OF THE FARM QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a proverb in Grange circles which expresses also the\r\nfundamental aim of all agricultural education--\"The farmer is of more\r\nconsequence than the farm and should be first improved.\" The first term\r\nin all agricultural prosperity is the man behind the plow. Improved\r\nagriculture is a matter of fertile brain rather than of fertile field.\r\nMind culture must precede soil culture.\r\n\r\nBut if the improved man is the first term in improved agriculture, if he\r\nis the effective cause of rural progress, he is also the last term and\r\nthe choice product of genuine agricultural advancement. We may\r\nparaphrase the sordid, \"raise more corn to feed more hogs to buy more\r\nland to raise more corn, etc.,\" into the divine, \"train better farmers\r\nto make better farming to grow better farmers, etc.\" We want trained men\r\nthat we may have an advancing agricultural art, that we may make every\r\nagricultural acre render its maximum. The improved acre, however, must\r\nyield not only corn but civilization, not only potatoes but culture,\r\nnot only wheat but effective manhood.\r\n\r\nBut we may carry the point a step farther. The individual farmer is the\r\nstarting-point and the end of agriculture, it is true. But the lone\r\nfarmer is an anomaly, either as a cause or as a product, as the lone man\r\nis everywhere. As an effective cause we must have co-operating\r\nindividuals, and as an end we desire an improved community and a\r\nhigher-grade _class_ of farmers.\r\n\r\nThe farm question then is a social question. Valuable as are the\r\ncontributions of science to the problems of soil and plant and animal,\r\nthe ultimate contribution comes from the development of improved men. So\r\nthe real end is not merely to utilize each acre to its utmost, nor to\r\nprovide cheap food for the people who do not farm, nor yet to render\r\nagriculture industrially strong. The gravest and most far-reaching\r\nconsideration is the social and patriotic one of endeavoring to develop\r\nand maintain an agricultural class which represents the very best type\r\nof American manhood and womanhood, to make the farm home the ideal home,\r\nto bring agriculture to such a state that the business will always\r\nattract the keen and the strong who at the same time care more for home\r\nand children and state and freedom than for millions. In other words,\r\nthe maintenance of the typical American farmer--the man who is\r\nessentially middle class, who is intelligent, who keeps a good standard\r\nof living, educates his children, serves his country, owns his\r\nmedium-sized farm, and who at death leaves a modest estate--the\r\nmaintenance of the typical American farmer is the real agricultural\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nIf this analysis is a correct one, it will vitally affect our plans for\r\nagricultural training. The student will be taught not only soil physics,\r\nbut social psychology. He will learn not only the action of bacteria in\r\nmilk fermentation, but the underlying causes of the social ferment among\r\nthe farmers of the last thirty years. He will concern himself with the\r\nvalue of farmers' organizations as well as with the co-operating\r\ninfluences of high-bred corn and high-bred steers. The function and\r\norganization of the rural school will be as serious a problem to him as\r\nthe building and management of the co-operative creamery. The country\r\nchurch and its career will interest him fully as much as does the latest\r\nsuccessful device for tying milch cows in the stable. He will want to\r\nget at the kernel of the political questions that confront agriculture\r\njust as fully and thoroughly as he wishes to master the formulae for\r\ncommercial fertilizers. No man will have acquired an adequate\r\nagricultural education who has not been trained in rural social science,\r\nand who does not recognize the bearing of this wide field of thought\r\nupon the business of farming as well as upon American destiny.\r\n\r\nResearch, too, will be touched with the social idea. The men who study\r\nconditions existing in rural communities which have to do with the real\r\nlife of the people--the effects of their environment, the tendencies of\r\ntheir habits and customs--will need as thorough preparation for their\r\nwork, and the result of their efforts will be as useful as that of the\r\nmen who labor in field and laboratory.\r\n\r\nBut the most profound consequence of recognizing the social side of the\r\nfarm question will be the new atmosphere created at the agricultural\r\ncolleges. These institutions are fast gaining leadership in all the\r\ntechnical questions of agriculture--leadership gladly granted by\r\nprogressive farmers whenever the institution is managed with\r\nintelligence and in the spirit of genuine sympathy with farming. But\r\nthese colleges must minister to the _whole farmer_. They must help the\r\nfarmer solve all his problems, whether these problems are scientific, or\r\neconomic, or social, or political. And let it be said in all earnestness\r\nthat in our rapidly shifting industrial order, the farmer's interest in\r\nthe political, social, and economic problems of his calling is fully as\r\ngreat as it is in those purely scientific and technical. And rightly so.\r\nA prime steer is a triumph. But it will not of itself keep the farmer\r\nfree. The 50-bushels-of-wheat acre is a grand business proposition\r\nprovided the general industrial conditions favor the grower as well as\r\nthe consumer. When our agricultural colleges enter into the fullest\r\nsympathy with all the rural problems, when the farm home and the rural\r\nschool and the country church and the farmer's civic rights and duties\r\nand all the relations of his business to other industries--when these\r\nquestions are \"in the air\" of our agricultural colleges, then and then\r\nalone will these colleges fulfil their true mission of being _all things\r\nto all farmers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE NEEDS OF NEW ENGLAND AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne might name a score of important activities that should be encouraged\r\nin order to better New England agriculture. But the two fundamental\r\nneeds are (1) adaptation and (2) co-operation.\r\n\r\nBy adaptation is meant such development of agriculture as shall more\r\nfully utilize existing physical and commercial conditions. The West has\r\nfor seventy-five years pressed hard upon New England farming. But along\r\nwith this western competition has come a new opportunity for the eastern\r\nfarmer. New England farmers as a whole have not quickly enough responded\r\nto this new opportunity. Many of their troubles may be traced to the\r\nfailure to adapt themselves to the new conditions. The men in New\r\nEngland who have met the new opportunity are succeeding.\r\n\r\nWhat does this adaptation consist in? It means, first, the adaptation of\r\nthe New England farmer to his markets. In most parts of the country the\r\ntype of farming is perhaps more dependent upon physical conditions of\r\nsoil and climate than upon the immediate market. In New England the\r\nreverse is now true, and the type of New England farming must be\r\nadapted, absolutely and completely, to the demands of its market. New\r\nEngland farmers have the most superb markets in the country. Of the six\r\nmillion people in New England, approximately 75 per cent. live in the\r\ncities and villages. There are, in New England, thirty cities having a\r\npopulation of twenty-five thousand or more. The great majority of these\r\ncities are manufacturing cities peopled by the best class of consumers\r\nin the world--the American skilled artisan. They constitute a nearby\r\nmarket that demands fresh products which cannot be transported across a\r\ncontinent. New England is also especially favored in its nearness to the\r\nEuropean market. The New England farmer then must adapt his crops, his\r\nmethods, and his style of farming to his peculiar market.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, this adaptation must be one of soil, just as\r\nanywhere else, only the problem here becomes more complicated because of\r\nthe varied character of the farming lands. How to make the valleys and\r\nthe hills, the rocky ridges and the sand plains of New England yield\r\ntheir largest possibilities in agriculture is a problem of the greatest\r\nscientific and industrial interest, and it is the problem that New\r\nEngland agriculture has to face. In this connection comes also the need\r\nof special varieties adapted not only to the market but to the soil and\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThis principle of adaptation is the industrial key to future\r\nagricultural development in New England. But to achieve this adaptation,\r\nto make the key work, there is needed the force of social organization.\r\nThe farmer must be reached before the farm can be improved. The man who\r\ntreads the furrow is a greater factor than nitrogen or potash. How is\r\nthis man to be reached, inspired, instructed? Largely by some form of\r\norganization. The second and greater need therefore is co-operation.\r\n\r\nCo-operation means faith in agriculture--a faith too seldom found in the\r\nIsrael of New England's yeomanry. Co-operation means ideals--ideals of\r\nrural possibilities too seldom dreamed of in the philosophy of the\r\nYankee farmer. Co-operation means power--power that cannot be acquired\r\nby the lone man, not even by the resolute individualism so dominant in\r\nNew England character.\r\n\r\nThere are three forms of co-operation, all of which are desirable and\r\neven essential if the most rapid agricultural progress in New England is\r\nto be secured--co-operation among individuals, among organizations,\r\namong states.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of New England must work together. The Grange is stronger in\r\nNew England than in any other portion of the country of similar\r\narea--yet not one farmer in ten belongs to the Grange. We need not dwell\r\non this point, for it is a truth constantly preached through the Grange\r\nand through other means. Let me suggest two ideas relative to\r\nco-operation which have not received so much attention.\r\n\r\nEach organization has its peculiar work. The school is to train the\r\nyoung, the agricultural college to prepare the youth, the farmers'\r\ninstitute to instruct and inspire the middle-aged and mature. The\r\nexperiment station seeks to discover the means by which nature and man\r\nmay better work together. The producers' unions endeavor to secure a\r\nfair price for their goods. The Grange enlarges the views of its members\r\nand brings the power which comes from working together, buying together,\r\nmeeting together, talking together, acting together. Boards of\r\nagriculture control conditions of health and disease among animals and\r\nplants. The country fair educates and interests. The church crowns all\r\nin its ministrations of spiritual vision, moral uplift, and insistence\r\nupon character as the supreme end of life.\r\n\r\nBut no institution can do the work of the others. They are members one\r\nof another. The hand cannot say to the foot, I have no need of thee. All\r\nthese things make for rural progress. None can be spared. The Grange\r\ncannot take the place of the church. The institute cannot supplant the\r\nGrange. The college course cannot reach the adult farmer. The experiment\r\nstation cannot instruct the young. The church cannot secure reforms in\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nThese agencies may however co-operate. Indeed the most rapid and most\r\nsecure rural progress, the broadest and soundest agricultural growth,\r\ncan not take place unless there be this form of co-operation. There will\r\ncome added interest, increased efficiency, larger views, greater\r\nambitions in our agricultural development, if, in each state, all of\r\nthese forces work together.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore welcome most cordially the proposed plan of federating\r\nthe various agricultural societies of each state into one grand\r\ncommittee organized for the purpose of forwarding all the agricultural\r\ninterests of that state. Let there be, moreover, a \"League for Rural\r\nProgress,\" in each state or, at least, an annual conference on rural\r\nprogress, in each state, in which the representatives of the farmers'\r\nsocieties, of the schools, of the churches, and indeed all other people\r\nwho have the slightest interest in rural advancement may meet to discuss\r\nplans and methods which shall better agriculture and the farmer.\r\n\r\nBut this is not enough. There ought to be co-operation among these\r\nvarious social institutions without respect to state lines. The farm\r\nproblem in New England is one problem, although differing in details, it\r\nis true, in different states. Co-operation should not stop with the\r\nfederating of the organizations of a state. There is no reason, for\r\ninstance, why the agricultural colleges and experiment stations of New\r\nEngland should not co-operate. It is not practicable to prevent all\r\nduplication of work. I do suggest the desirability and the feasibility\r\nof genuine co-operation.\r\n\r\nWhy should not those in charge of the rural schools of all New England\r\nmeet together and discuss the difficulties and achievements as they\r\nexist in different states? Why not have a \"New England Society for\r\nAgricultural Education,\" in which all organizations and all individuals\r\nwho are interested in any phase of this subject may meet for discussing\r\nNew England problems? Could not boards of agriculture co-operate to some\r\nextent, especially in farmers' institute work with general plans and\r\nideas? Certainly conferences between these boards ought to yield most\r\nvaluable results. Is the idea of a genuine New England fair a mere\r\ndream?\r\n\r\nCannot the Granges of New England profitably co-operate more fully? It\r\nis true that there is considerable intervisitation, and yet the rank and\r\nfile of members in one state know comparatively little of the progress\r\nand methods of the Grange in an adjoining state; this knowledge is\r\nconfined to a few leaders. Would it not be worth while to attempt an\r\noccasional New England assemblage of Grange members, a representative\r\ngathering for discussing Grange work and for enthusing the Grange people\r\nof New England with the possibilities of still further Grange\r\ndevelopment?\r\n\r\nThe idea of New England as a unit of interest in church matters is\r\nalready exemplified by the appointment of a New England secretary of the\r\nfederation of churches. It is not too much to expect that, in the near\r\nfuture, all the means for church federation in New England shall work\r\ntogether, because it is evident that co-operation and unity are demanded\r\nby the nature of the field.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, is it idle to think that there might be a New England\r\nLeague for Rural Progress or, at least, a New England Conference on\r\nRural Progress, which shall bring from every corner of New England\r\nrepresentatives of the agricultural colleges, of the Granges, of the\r\ncountry church, of the rural school, of the country press, and all other\r\nindividuals who believe in the possibilities of New England agriculture,\r\nand in the efficiency of the fullest and freest co-operation?\r\n\r\nThere are several powerful reasons why an attempt to better New England\r\nagriculture will be greatly aided by co-operation that includes every\r\ninch of New England soil from Boston harbor to the Berkshires, and from\r\nMt. Katahdin to Point Judith.\r\n\r\n(1) The importance of New England agriculture. In the appended table is\r\nattempted a comparison between New England as a unit, the state of\r\nMichigan representing an average agricultural state, and the state of\r\nIowa representing the foremost agricultural state. The figures, taken\r\nfrom the Census of 1900, are given in round numbers. Such a table is not\r\nconclusive as to agricultural conditions. But it is very suggestive as\r\nto the importance of New England agriculture both industrially and\r\nsocially. It will be seen that, with an area only a little larger than\r\nMichigan, New England compares in every respect favorably with that\r\naverage state and, in some respects, excels it, while it excels both\r\nMichigan and Iowa by 65 per cent. in gross value of product per acre of\r\nimproved land.\r\n\r\n(2) Agricultural conditions all over New England are quite similar.\r\nSpeaking broadly, the soil and climate of one state are the soil and\r\nclimate of another. The people are of the same stock, the same views,\r\nthe same habits, the same traditions. The demand of the market is fairly\r\nuniform for different sections. The New England city is the New\r\nEnglander's special possession as a market. Farm labor conditions are\r\nmuch the same. In fact, there is hardly a portion of our country, of the\r\nsame area, which in all these respects yields itself more completely to\r\nthe idea of unity.\r\n\r\n(3) The hopefulness of the farm problem. Nearly four millions of city\r\npeople live in New England. They must be fed. The nearness of the\r\nmarket means high-class products. This means intensive agriculture.\r\nIntensive agriculture means education and intelligence. The cities are\r\ngrowing. Their power of consumption is steadily and rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\n(4) The unusual social equipment. It must be remembered that in an area\r\nbut little larger than Iowa, which has one agricultural college and one\r\nagricultural experiment station and no Granges to speak of, New England\r\nhas, in comparison, six agricultural colleges, six experiment stations,\r\nsix boards of agriculture, over a thousand Granges, and numerous\r\nagricultural societies. The means of agricultural education in New\r\nEngland are more numerous and may be more efficient than in any other\r\nportion of this country of similar area. Moreover, the cities are now in\r\na position to help solve the problem in New England. They have leaders.\r\nThere are in them men with leisure and talent who are interested in this\r\nproblem and who are willing to help solve it.\r\n\r\n(5) The sentimental side. A campaign for rural progress, with New\r\nEngland as the unit, ought to arouse the pride and enthusiasm of all the\r\nsons and daughters of New England who still have the privilege of living\r\nwithin her borders, as well as the interest and sympathy of all her\r\ngrandsons who, though living under western skies, still cherish in their\r\nhearts the deepest affection for their Fatherland. Shall not the idea of\r\nuniting all the forces of agricultural betterment that exist in New\r\nEngland be a stimulus to every farmer in the six states, and, indeed,\r\nattract the sympathy and practical aid of every lover of New England\r\nsoil?\r\n\r\nAdaptation, co-operation: these are the primary needs of New England\r\nagriculture; an adaptation of the farmer and his farm to existing\r\nconditions, a co-operation that unites individual farmers into various\r\nassociated efforts, that federates the work and influence of the\r\ndifferent social agencies within the state, and that ultimately secures\r\nthe unity of all New England in a great movement for rural advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n   ===================================================================\r\n                        |  New England |   Michigan   |      Iowa\r\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Total land area--    |              |              |\r\n     square miles       |       62,000 |       57,500 |         55,500\r\n   Number of farms      |      192,000 |      203,000 |        229,000\r\n   Acreage in farms     |   20,500,000 |   17,500,000 |     34,600,000\r\n   Acres of improved    |              |              |\r\n     land               |    8,135,000 |   11,800,000 |     29,900,000\r\n   Value of farms       | $640,000,000 | $690,000,000 | $1,835,000,000\r\n   Value of farm        |              |              |\r\n     products           | $170,000,000 | $147,000,000 |   $365,000,000\r\n   Persons engaged in   |              |              |\r\n     agriculture        |      290,000 |      312,000 |        372,000\r\n   Rural population     |    1,500,000 |    1,200,000 |      1,260,000\r\n   Value of products per|              |              |\r\n     acre of improved   |              |              |\r\n     land               |         $20  |         $12  |           $12\r\n   Number of Granges    |       1,200  |         725  |\r\n   Number of Grange     |              |              |\r\n     members            |     120,000  |      45,000  |\r\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nAN UNTILLED FIELD IN AMERICAN EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural education in this country has thus far been an attempt to\r\napply a knowledge of the laws of the so-called \"natural\" sciences to the\r\npractical operations of the farm. Comparatively little attention has\r\nbeen paid to the application of the principles of the \"social\" sciences\r\nto the life of the farmer. All this is partly explained by the fact that\r\nthe natural sciences were fairly well developed when the needs of the\r\nfarmer called the scientist to work with and for the man behind the\r\nplow, when a vanishing soil fertility summoned the chemist to the\r\nservice of the grain grower, when the improvement of breeds of stock and\r\nraces of plants began to appeal to the biologist. Moreover, these\r\npractical applications of the physical and biological sciences are, and\r\nalways will be, a fundamental necessity in the agricultural question.\r\n\r\nBut in the farm problem we cannot afford to ignore the economic and\r\nsociological phases. While it may be true that the practical success of\r\nthe individual farmer depends largely upon his business sense and his\r\ntechnical education, it is folly to hope that the success of agriculture\r\nas an industry and the influence of farmers as a class can be based\r\nsolely upon the ability of each farmer to raise a big crop and to sell\r\nit to advantage. General intelligence, appreciation of the trend of\r\neconomic and social forces, capacity to co-operate, ability to voice his\r\nneeds and his rights, are just as vital acquirements for the farmer as\r\nknowing how to make two blades of grass grow where but one grew before.\r\nIt finally comes to this, that the American farmer is obliged to study\r\nthe questions that confront him as a member of the industrial order and\r\nas a factor in the social and political life of the nation, with as much\r\nzeal and understanding as he is expected to show in the study of those\r\nnatural laws governing the soil and the crops and the animals that he\r\nowns.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is significant to note that farmers themselves are\r\nalready quite as interested in the social problems of their particular\r\ncalling and in the general economic and political questions of the day,\r\nas they are in science applied to their business of tilling the soil.\r\nNot necessarily that they minimize the latter, but they seem\r\ninstinctively to recognize that social forces may work them ill or work\r\nthem good according to the direction and power of those forces. This\r\nstatement is illustrated by the fact that the aims, purposes, labors,\r\nand discussions of the great farmers' organizations like the Grange are\r\nsocial in character, having to do with questions that are political,\r\neconomic, sociological.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we turn to those public educational agencies that are\r\nintended to assist in the solution of the farm problem, we discover that\r\nthey are giving slight attention to the social side of the question. An\r\nexamination of the catalogues of the agricultural colleges, whether\r\nseparate institutions or colleges of state universities, reveals the\r\nfact that, beyond elementary work in economics, in civics, and\r\noccasionally in sociology, little opportunity is given students to study\r\nthe farm question from its social standpoint. With a few exceptions,\r\nthese institutions offer no courses whatever in rural social problems,\r\nand even in these exceptional cases the work offered is hardly\r\ncommensurate with the importance of the subject. Nearly all our other\r\ncolleges and universities are subject to the same comment. The average\r\nstudent of problems in economics and sociology and education gains on\r\nconception whatever of the importance and character of the rural phases\r\nof our industrial and social life.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged in explanation of this state of affairs that the liberal\r\nstudy of the social sciences in our colleges and universities and\r\nespecially any large attention to the practical problems of economics\r\nand sociology, is a comparatively recent thing. This is true and is a\r\ngood excuse. But it does not offer a reason why the social phases of\r\nagriculture should be longer neglected. The purpose of this article is\r\nless to criticize than to describe a situation and to urge the\r\ntimeliness of the large development, in the near future, of rural social\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the queries may arise, What is meant by rural social\r\nscience? and, What is there to be investigated and taught under such a\r\nhead? The answer to the first query has already been intimated. Rural\r\nsocial science is the application of the principles of the social\r\nsciences, especially of economics and sociology, to the problems that\r\nconfront the American farmer. As a reply to the second query there are\r\nappended at the end of this chapter outlines of possible courses in\r\nagricultural economics and rural sociology, which were prepared by the\r\nwriter for the exhibit in \"rural economy\" at the St. Louis exposition.\r\nThere are also subjects that have a political bearing, such as local\r\ngovernment in the country, and primary reform in rural communities,\r\nwhich perhaps ought not to be omitted. So, too, various phases of home\r\nlife and of art might be touched upon. The subjects suggested and others\r\nlike them could be conveniently grouped into from two to a dozen\r\ncourses, as circumstances might require.\r\n\r\nWhat classes of people may be expected to welcome and profit by\r\ninstruction of this character? (1) The farmers themselves. Assuming that\r\nour agricultural colleges are designed, among other functions, to train\r\nmen and women to become influential farmers, no argument is necessary to\r\nshow how studies in rural social science may help qualify these students\r\nfor genuine leadership of their class of toilers. On the other hand, it\r\nmay be remarked that no subjects will better lend themselves to college\r\nextension work than those named above. Lectures and lecture courses for\r\ngranges, farmers' clubs, farmers' institutes, etc., on such themes would\r\narouse the greatest interest. Correspondence and home study courses\r\nalong these lines would be fully as popular as those treating of soils\r\nand crops. (2) Agricultural educators. The soil physicist or the\r\nagricultural chemist will not be a less valuable specialist in his own\r\nline, and he certainly will be a more useful member of the faculty of an\r\nagricultural college, if he has an appreciative knowledge of the\r\nfarmer's social and economic status. This is even more true of men\r\ncalled to administer agricultural education in any of its phases. (3)\r\nRural school administrators and the more progressive rural teachers. The\r\ncountry school can never become truly a social and intellectual center\r\nof the community until the rural educators understand the social\r\nenvironment of the farmer. (4)Country clergymen. The vision of a\r\nsocial-service church in the country will remain but a dream unless,\r\nadded to the possession of a heart for such work, the clergyman knows\r\nthe farm problem sufficiently to appreciate the broader phases of the\r\nindustrial and social life of his people. (5) Editors of farm papers,\r\nand of the so-called \"country\" papers. Probably the editors of the\r\nbetter class of agricultural papers are less in need of instruction such\r\nas that suggested than is almost anyone else. Yet the same arguments\r\nthat now lead many young men aspiring to this class of journalism to\r\nregard a course in scientific agriculture as a vestibule to their work\r\nmay well be used in urging a study of rural social science, especially\r\nat a time when social and economic problems are pressing upon the\r\nfarmer. As for the country papers, the work of purveying local gossip\r\nand stirring the party kettle too often obscures the tremendous\r\npossibilities for a high-class service to the rural community which such\r\npapers may render. No men, in the agricultural states at least, have\r\nmore real influence in their community than the trained, clean, manly,\r\ncountry editors--and there is a multitude of such men. If as a class\r\nthey possessed also a wider appreciation of the farmer's industrial\r\ndifficulties and needs, hardly anyone could give better service to the\r\nsolution of the farm problem than could they. (6) Everybody else! That\r\nis to say, the agricultural question is big enough and important enough\r\nto be understood by educated people. The farmers are half our people.\r\nFarming is our largest single industrial interest. The capital invested\r\nin agriculture is four-fifths the capital invested in manufacturing and\r\nrailway transportation combined. Whether an individual has a special\r\ninterest in business, in economics, in education, or in religious\r\ninstitutions, he ought to know the place of the farm and the farmer in\r\nthat question. No one can have a full appreciation of the social and\r\nindustrial life of the American people who is ignorant of the\r\nagricultural status.\r\n\r\nThe natural place to begin work in rural social science is the\r\nagricultural college. Future farmers and teachers of farmers are\r\nsupposed to be there. The subjects embraced are as important in solving\r\nthe farm problem as are biology, physics, or chemistry. No skilled\r\nfarmer or leader of farmers should be without some reasonably correct\r\nnotions of the principles that determine the position of agriculture in\r\nthe industrial world. A brief study of the elements of political\r\neconomy, of sociology, of civics, is not enough; no more than the study\r\nof the elements of botany, of chemistry and of zoology is enough. The\r\nspecific problems of the farmer that are economic need elucidation\r\nalongside the study of soils and crops, of plant-and stock-breeding. And\r\nthese economic topics should be thoroughly treated by men trained in\r\nsocial science, and not incidentally by men whose chief interest is\r\ntechnical agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe normal schools may well discuss the propriety of adding one or two\r\ncourses which bear on the social and economic situation of the rural\r\nclasses. While these schools do not now send out many teachers into\r\nrural schools, they may do so under the system of centralized schools;\r\nand in any event they furnish rural school administrators, as well as\r\ninstructors of rural teachers. There seems to be a growing sentiment\r\nwhich demands of the school and of the teacher a closer touch with life\r\nas it is actually lived. How can rural teachers learn to appreciate the\r\nsocial function of the rural school, except they be taught?\r\n\r\nNor is there any reason why the theological seminaries, or at least the\r\ninstitutions that prepare the men who become country clergymen, should\r\nnot cover some of the subjects suggested. If the ambition of some people\r\nto see the country church a social and intellectual center is to be\r\nrealized, the minister must know the rural problem broadly. The same\r\narguments that impel the city pastor to become somewhat familiar with\r\nthe economic, social, and civic questions of the day hold with equal\r\nforce when applied to the necessary preparation for the rural ministry.\r\n\r\nThe universities may be called upon to train teachers and investigators\r\nin rural social science for service in agricultural colleges, normal\r\nschools, and theological seminaries. Moreover, there is no good reason\r\nwhy any college or university graduate should not know more than he does\r\nabout the farm problem. There can be little doubt that the interest in\r\nthe farm question is very rapidly growing, and that the universities\r\nwill be but meeting a demand if they begin very soon to offer courses in\r\nrural social science.\r\n\r\nThe arguments for rural social science rest, let us observe, not only\r\nupon its direct aid to the farmers themselves, but upon its value as a\r\nbasis for that intelligent social service which preacher, teacher, and\r\neditor may render the farming class. It is an essential underlying\r\ncondition for the successful federation of rural social forces. Indeed\r\nit should in some degree be a part of the equipment of every educated\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to add, in conclusion, that instruction in\r\nrural social problems should be placed in the hands of men who are\r\nthoroughly trained in social science as well as accurate, experienced,\r\nand sympathetic observers of rural conditions. It would be mischievous\r\nindeed if in the desire to be progressive any educational institution\r\nshould offer courses in rural social science which gave superficial or\r\nerroneous ideas about the scientific principles involved, or which\r\nencouraged in any degree whatever the notion that the farmer's business\r\nand welfare are not vitally and forever bound up with the business and\r\nwelfare of all other classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE FOR A BRIEF COURSE IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.

The federation or co-operation of rural social agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nFEDERATION FOR RURAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is almost trite to assert the need of the \"socialization\"--to use a\r\nmuch-worked phrase--of the country. It is possible that this need is not\r\ngreater than in the cities, but it is different. Among no class of\r\npeople is individualism so rampant as among farmers. For more than a\r\ncentury the American farmer led the freest possible social life. His\r\nindependence was his glory. But, when the day of co-operation dawned, he\r\nfound himself out of tune with the movement, was disinclined to join the\r\nranks of organized effort, and he prefers even yet his personal and\r\nlocal independence to the truer freedom which can be secured only\r\nthrough co-operative endeavor. Moreover, the social aspect of the rural\r\nproblem is important not merely because the farmer is slow to\r\nco-operate. The farm problem is to be met by the activities of social\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nWe may say (assuming the home life, of course) that the church, the\r\nschool, and the farmers' organization are the great rural social\r\ninstitutions. They are the forces now most efficient, and the ones that\r\npromise to abide. This classification may appear to be a mere truism,\r\nwhen we suggest that under the church should be placed all those\r\nmovements that have a distinctively religious motive, under the school\r\nall those agencies that are primarily educational in design, and under\r\nfarmers' organizations those associations whose chief function is to\r\nsettle questions which concern the farmer as a business man and a\r\ncitizen. But the classification answers fairly well. It includes\r\npractically every device that has been suggested for rural betterment.\r\n\r\nThere are two interesting facts about these rural institutions: (1) None\r\nof them is doing a tithe of what it ought to be doing to help solve the\r\nfarm problem. The church is apparently just about holding its own,\r\nthough that is doubted by some observers. Rural schools are not, as a\r\nrule, keeping pace with the demands being made upon them; comparatively\r\nfew students in the whole country are studying scientific agriculture.\r\nNot one farmer in twenty belongs to a strong farmers' organization. (2)\r\nAll these institutions are awakening to the situation. Progress during\r\nthe last decade has been especially gratifying. Co-operative efforts\r\namong farmers are more cautious, but more successful. The Grange has\r\nnearly doubled its membership since 1890; and it, as well as other farm\r\norganizations, has more real power than ever before. The rural-school\r\nquestion is one of the liveliest topics today among farmers as well as\r\neducators. Opportunities for agricultural education have had a marvelous\r\ndevelopment within a decade. Discussion about rural church federation,\r\nthe rural institutional church, rural social settlements, and even\r\nexperiments in these lines are becoming noticeably frequent. The Young\r\nMen's Christian Association has, its officers think, found the way to\r\nreach the country young man.\r\n\r\nThe institutions which we have just discussed, together with the\r\nimprovement that comes from such physical agencies as assist quicker\r\ncommunication (good wagon roads, telephones, rural mail delivery,\r\nelectric roads), constitute the social forces that are to be depended\r\nupon in rural betterment. None can be spared or ignored. The function of\r\neach must be understood and its importance recognized. To imagine that\r\nsubstantial progress can result from the emphasis of any one agency to\r\nthe exclusion of any other is a mistake. To assert this is not to\r\nquarrel with the statement we frequently hear nowadays that \"the\r\n_church_ should be the social and intellectual center of the\r\nneighborhood;\" or that \"the _school_ should be the social and\r\nintellectual center of the neighborhood;\" or that \"the _Grange_ should\r\nbe the social and intellectual center of the neighborhood.\" It is\r\nfortunate that these statements have been made. They show an\r\nappreciation of a function of these agencies that has been neglected.\r\nThe first item in rural social progress is that the country preacher,\r\nthe rural teacher, the country doctor, the country editor, the\r\nagricultural editor, the agricultural college professor, and especially\r\nthe farmer himself, shall see the social need of the farm community. But\r\nto assert, for instance, that the church shall be _the_ social center of\r\nthat community may lead to a partial and even to a fanatical view of\r\nthings. I would not restrain in the slightest the enthusiasm of any\r\npastor who wants to make his church occupy a central position in\r\ncommunity life, nor of the teacher who wants to bring her school into\r\nrelation with all the economic and social life of the farm, nor of the\r\nleader of the farmers' organization who sees the good that may be done\r\nthrough the social and intellectual training which his organization can\r\ngive. But if there is danger that the preacher in the pursuit of this\r\nideal, shall ignore the social function of the school and of the\r\nfarmers' organization, or that the teacher, or the farmer, or anybody\r\nelse who is interested, shall fail to see that there is a logical\r\ndivision of labor among rural social forces, and that it is only the\r\nintelligent and efficient and harmonious co-operation of all these\r\nforces that will insure the best progress, then to such I appeal with\r\nall the power at my command to recognize not only the breadth of the\r\nwhole movement, but to appreciate the limitations of their own special\r\ninterests. There are things that the church cannot do and should not\r\nattempt to do. There are things the school cannot do and should not\r\nattempt to do. Accepting our conventional division of social agencies,\r\nwe may say that efficient rural progress stands upon a tripod of forces,\r\nand that balance can be maintained only when each is used in its proper\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nWe reach now the heart of the topic, which is how these various social\r\nforces may be brought into co-operation--a co-operation that is\r\nintelligent and real. I would suggest, first of all, the encouragement\r\nof all efforts along this line that are already under way. For\r\ninstance, there are scattered all over this country individual pastors\r\nwho are seeking to make their churches the social and intellectual\r\nbeacon-lights of the community. There are other individuals who are\r\nendeavoring to apply the social-settlement idea to the needs of the\r\ncountry. There are associations which attempt to bring together the\r\nteachers and the school patrons for mutual discussion of educational\r\ntopics. In numerous instances the farmers' organizations include in\r\ntheir membership the country pastor, the district school teacher and\r\nperhaps the country doctor. In these and doubtless in other ways the\r\nidea we are dealing with is being promulgated, and up to a certain point\r\nthis fact of promiscuous initiative is entirely satisfactory and\r\ndesirable. So long as the work is done it makes little difference who\r\ndoes it. Every attempt to bring any of these agencies into closer touch\r\nwith the farm community is to be welcomed most heartily. But beyond a\r\ncertain limit this promiscuous work must be unsatisfactory. The efforts\r\nand interests of any one social agency are bound to be partial. Indeed\r\nthe more effective such an agency is, the more partial it is likely to\r\nbe. Intensity is gained at the expense of breadth. The need for\r\nfederation exists in the desirability of securing both the intensity and\r\nthe breadth.\r\n\r\nThe precise method of securing this federation of effort is not easy to\r\nforesee. It can be determined only by trial. It must be worked out in\r\nharmony with varying conditions. Some very general plans at once suggest\r\nthemselves: (1) Let the agricultural college in each state take the lead\r\nin the movement, acting not so much as an organization as a\r\nclearing-house and a go-between. Let it direct conferences on the\r\nsubject, and seek to bring all who are interested in rural affairs into\r\ntouch and sympathy. (2) Have a \"League for Rural Progress,\" made up of\r\nrepresentatives from the churches, the agricultural colleges, the\r\ndepartments of public instruction, the farm press, various farmers'\r\norganizations, etc. (3) Enlarge the \"Hesperia movement,\" which now seeks\r\nto secure co-operation between school and farmers' organization, by\r\nincluding in it the church.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to note that this idea of a federation of rural\r\nsocial forces is getting a foothold and has indeed already crystallized\r\ninto organization. A brief description of what has actually been done\r\nwill therefore not be out of place.\r\n\r\nSo far as the writer is aware, the first meeting based on the definite\r\nidea of co-operation between school, church, and Grange was held at\r\nMorris, Connecticut, in the summer of 1901 and was organized by Rev. F.\r\nA. Holden, then pastor at Morris. This meeting was a very successful\r\nlocal affair, held in connection with \"Old Home Week\" celebration.\r\n\r\nProbably the first attempt to hold a similar meeting on a large scale\r\nwas the conference at the Agricultural College, Michigan, in February,\r\n1902. It was a joint meeting of the Michigan Political Science\r\nAssociation and the Agricultural College and farmers' institutes. The\r\npractical initiative was taken by the Political Science Association\r\nunder the leadership of its secretary, Professor Henry C. Adams, who had\r\nthe cordial co-operation of President Snyder of the Agricultural College\r\nand Professor C. D. Smith, then superintendent of farmers' institutes.\r\nIt was a notable gathering, and its promoters were rejoiced to see the\r\nsplendid attendance of farmers particularly; teachers and clergymen did\r\nnot attend as freely as might have been expected. The programme was a\r\nstrong one and included men of national reputation and topics covering a\r\nwide range of interests.\r\n\r\nThe addresses were published in the _Michigan Farmers' Institute\r\nBulletin_ for 1901-02, and were also gathered into a publication of the\r\nMichigan Political Science Association under the title _Social Problems\r\nof the Farmer_.\r\n\r\nThe state of Rhode Island has organized on a permanent basis. In 1904\r\nthere was held in Kingston, at the College of Agriculture and Mechanic\r\nArts, a \"Conference on Rural Progress.\" It was a one-day meeting, well\r\nattended by representative farmers, clergymen, and educators. A\r\ncommittee was appointed to discuss further procedure, and the next year\r\nthere was held in the halls of Brown University a two-days' conference.\r\nThe programme included addresses on: The Grange, The Country Church,\r\nSchool Gardens, and several phases of practical agriculture. Among the\r\nspeakers were the assistant secretary of agriculture, Hon. N. J.\r\nBachelder, now Master of the National Grange, and Dr. Josiah Strong.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1906 there was organized \"The Rhode Island League for\r\nRural Progress,\" which was constituted through representation from the\r\nfollowing organizations: State Board of Agriculture; Rhode Island\r\nCollege of Agriculture; State Federation of Churches; State Grange;\r\nState Association of School Superintendents; State League of Improvement\r\nSocieties; Washington County Agricultural Society; Newport Agricultural\r\nSociety; Rhode Island Horticultural Society; Newport Horticultural\r\nSociety; Rhode Island Poultry Association; Florists and Gardeners' Club;\r\nKingston Improvement Association.\r\n\r\nThis league held the Third Annual Conference on Rural Progress, April 10\r\nand 11, 1906, the first day's session being at Brown University,\r\nProvidence, and the second day's at East Greenwich. Its fourth meeting\r\nwas held in Newport in March, 1907. In Rhode Island the idea lying back\r\nof this conference has certainly approved itself to all who are\r\ninterested in rural matters.\r\n\r\nThe following is the constitution of the league:\r\n\r\n\r\n     CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n     Rhode Island League for Rural Progress\r\n\r\n     I. NAME.--The name of this body shall be the \"Rhode Island League\r\n     for Rural Progress.\"\r\n\r\n     II. OBJECT.--The object of the League shall be to secure the\r\n     co-operation of the various individuals, organizations, and\r\n     agencies which are working for any phase of rural advancement in\r\n     this state.\r\n\r\n     III. MEMBERSHIP.--Any organization interested in rural advancement,\r\n     which may desire to co-operate with the work of the League, may be\r\n     represented in the League.\r\n\r\n     Any individual in the state interested in rural progress may become\r\n     a member of the League upon the payment of one dollar annual fee.\r\n\r\n     IV. OFFICERS.--The administrative work of the League shall be\r\n     conducted by a council, to be composed of one delegate from each\r\n     organization represented in the League, to serve until superseded.\r\n     The council at the time of each annual conference shall choose from\r\n     among its members a president, a vice-president, and a\r\n     secretary-treasurer, and these officers shall act as an executive\r\n     committee.\r\n\r\n     V. MEETINGS.--The meetings of the League shall be held at the call\r\n     of the executive committee. There shall, however, be at least one\r\n     annual Conference on rural progress held under the auspices of the\r\n     League.\r\n\r\n     VI. FINANCES.--The funds necessary to forward the work of the\r\n     League may come from three sources:\r\n\r\n     _a_) Contributions made by organizations belonging to the League\r\n     and represented on the council, such contributions to be voluntary\r\n     and in such amount as the respective organizations may designate.\r\n     The council may, however, make up a schedule of desired\r\n     contributions from the various organizations and present it to the\r\n     different organizations.\r\n\r\n     _b_) Membership fees from individual members, $1.00 per year from\r\n     each member.\r\n\r\n     _c_) Private subscriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the first successful attempt to organize a permanent league for\r\nrural progress was accomplished in 1904 through the efforts of Rev. G.\r\nT. Nesmith, of Hebron, Ill. It was called \"The McHenry County\r\nFederation,\" and has held three annual meetings and seems to be on a\r\nsolid basis. Mr. Nesmith has endeavored to keep the purpose of the\r\nleague on a high plane by endeavoring to state clearly the object of the\r\nfederation, which is, \"that the people of McHenry County might have\r\nlife, and have it more abundantly, and this life was not to be a narrow\r\nlife. It was the largest aggregate and highest symmetry of the sixfold\r\nends of individual and community action, viz., health, wealth,\r\nknowledge, sociability, beauty, and righteousness.\" He also endeavored\r\nto make it clear that \"the federation does not seek to supplant the\r\nother forces. It rather seeks to be a clearing-house of the ideas of all\r\nthe federated organizations; to be a mount of vision from which each may\r\nlook and get a complete vision of life; to be a fraternal bond which\r\nshall link all together in common ties of sympathy, fellowship, and\r\nco-operation.\"\r\n\r\nThe results thus far obtained are perhaps best described by quoting the\r\nwords of Mr. G. W. Conn, Jr., superintendent of schools of McHenry\r\nCounty:\r\n\r\n\r\n     There is one noticeable omission in the constitution--a provision\r\n     for the proper financing of the federation. This is partially\r\n     explained by the fact that the federation has largely centered\r\n     about the county Teachers' Association and the county Farmers'\r\n     Institute, organizations that are supported in a financial way by\r\n     the county and the state appropriations. These appropriations, in\r\n     addition to some voluntary gifts, have been sufficient to meet the\r\n     necessary expenses of the meetings.\r\n\r\n     I think that I am safe in saying that the interest and also the\r\n     attendance has probably increased 100 per cent. at each session.\r\n     Each year has also seen a much larger percentage of our local men\r\n     and women helping out on the programme. It is a little early in its\r\n     history to expect much evidence of material results, but I believe\r\n     that results are already putting in an appearance, especially from\r\n     the esthetic standpoint. Without doubt more trees have been planted\r\n     about the country homes and along the country roadsides of this\r\n     county than in any two preceding years. In a great many places\r\n     roads have been cleaned. Refuse and weeds have been removed and\r\n     burned. Landscape gardening on a simple scale is putting in an\r\n     appearance in places where it was little expected. The naming of\r\n     farms is another feature that is rapidly growing. Boys' country\r\n     clubs are being formed and this year, for the first time, three of\r\n     these clubs met with the federation, had a banquet, and formed a\r\n     county organization.\r\n\r\n     Of course not all of these movements are rightfully to be\r\n     attributed to the direct influence of the county federation. The\r\n     public schools of the county have been largely instrumental in\r\n     stirring the public conscience to a livelier appreciation of the\r\n     beautiful. The regular observance of Arbor and Bird Days in our\r\n     schools has done much toward initiating this movement. However, the\r\n     federation has been the great factor in uniting otherwise\r\n     independent organizations into one large machine for stirring the\r\n     social consciousness and molding public sentiment. It has proved to\r\n     be an efficient association in at least three ways, in\r\n     co-ordinating our efforts, harmonizing our methods, and broadening\r\n     the field of operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitution of this league is given herewith in full:\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. NAME.--The name of this organization shall be, The McHenry\r\n     County Federation of Rural Forces.\r\n\r\n     2. OBJECT.--The object of the Federation is to gain a higher\r\n     symmetry and a larger aggregate of health, wealth, knowledge,\r\n     sociability, beauty, and righteousness to the citizens of McHenry\r\n     County.\r\n\r\n     3. ELEMENTS OF THE FEDERATION.--The Federation shall consist of the\r\n     following organizations: The Farmers' Institute, Teachers'\r\n     Association, Domestic Science Association, Pastors' Association,\r\n     Women's Christian Temperance Union, and the Young Men's Christian\r\n     Association.\r\n\r\n     4.

Its object is \"to contribute to\r\nthe formation of a strong, definite, and united purpose among the forces\r\nworking for the improvement of civic and social conditions in\r\nMassachusetts, by bringing together all town and village improvement\r\nsocieties, citizen's associations, civic clubs, and other organizations\r\ninterested in this purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Agricultural College, in celebrating the fortieth\r\nanniversary of its opening to students, October 2, 1907, held a four\r\ndays' conference on rural progress. The programme covered nearly the\r\nwhole field of rural development and was made possible by the\r\nco-operation of the State Board of Agriculture, the State Grange, the\r\nMassachusetts Civic League, the Connecticut Valley Congregational Club,\r\nthe State Committee of the Y. M. C. A., the Western Massachusetts\r\nLibrary Club, and the Head-Masters' Club of the Connecticut Valley. No\r\npermanent organization was formed, but the general idea of federation of\r\nrural social forces was fully emphasized and thoroughly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made in the spring of 1907 to bring together the various\r\nelements of rural progress in all the New England states. Under the\r\ninitiative of the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture there was\r\nheld in March, 1907, a New England Conference on Rural Progress. This\r\nmeeting was held very largely for the purpose of discovering the\r\nsentiment among the leaders of New England agriculture with respect to\r\nthe desirability and practicability of federating on so large a scale.\r\nIn addition to the main meeting, the presidents of the agricultural\r\ncolleges of New England were called together in a special section, and\r\nthe same was true of the directors of the New England experiment\r\nstations, the masters of the various state granges, the secretaries of\r\nthe various state boards of agriculture, and the leaders in the New\r\nEngland Federation of Churches.\r\n\r\nThe idea of federation was clearly approved by the delegates present,\r\nand a temporary organization was effected. It was voted to hold a\r\nsimilar conference in Boston in the spring of 1908.\r\n\r\nIt is probably true that the first and most important step in bringing\r\nabout a federation of rural social forces is to educate all concerned to\r\nthe _desirability_ of such a federation--to sow the seeds of the idea.\r\nSo far as machinery is concerned it may not be necessary to form any new\r\norganization. Indeed, what is chiefly necessary is a sort of\r\n_clearing-house_ for an exchange of ideas and plans among all who are at\r\nwork on any phase of the rural social problem. There is need of a\r\ncentral bureau that shall emphasize the necessity of a study of\r\nagricultural economics and rural sociology, and press the value of\r\nco-operation in the work of social progress in the country. There is\r\nneed that somewhere \"tab\" shall be kept on the whole rural social\r\nmovement. We need a directing force to assure a comprehensive view and\r\nstudy of the whole rural problem. It is important that some\r\ninvestigations should be carried on that are not likely to be taken up\r\nby some other agency. It would be desirable to have a certain amount of\r\npublication, and in various other ways to carry on a campaign of\r\neducation. Above all, it would be desirable to initiate local, state,\r\nand national conferences pervaded by the spirit and purpose of securing\r\nthe hearty co-operation of all rural social forces, of all the\r\norganizations that have any rural connection whatever, and of all\r\nindividuals who have the slightest genuine interest in any phase of the\r\nfarm problem.\r\n\r\nSuch a bureau should keep in constant touch with, secure the confidence\r\nof, and supply appropriate literature to, country teachers, preachers,\r\neditors, doctors, and business men, and, more than all, to intelligent\r\nand progressive farmers. And let me add at this point, that it must be\r\nfully understood that the work contemplated cannot possibly achieve\r\nlarge success unless it is done _with_ the farmers, rather than _for_\r\nthe farmers. The problem is far from that of doing a missionary work for\r\na down-trodden and ignorant class. It is a much less heroic, a much more\r\ncommonplace task. It is simply carrying the idea of co-operation of\r\nindividuals a step farther, and endeavoring to secure the co-operation\r\nof interests that have precisely the same goal, although traveling upon\r\ndifferent roads. The prime purpose of the movement is to bring the\r\nspecialist into close touch with the more general phases of the problem,\r\nto secure breadth and wholeness, to assure well-balanced effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [NOTE.--A paper with the title of this chapter was read before the\r\n     American Civic Association in 1901, at Minneapolis. A portion of\r\n     the paper is retained here. The history of the development of the\r\n     idea of federation is brought down to the present time.]",
