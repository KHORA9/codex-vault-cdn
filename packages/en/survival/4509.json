Published March, 1907.\r\n\r\nReprinted April, July, 1907; March, 1908; June,\r\n\r\nSeptember, 1910; April, 1912; April 1914.\r\n\r\nNew edition, revised February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are not tied to a desk or to a bench; we stay there only because\r\nwe think we are tied.\r\n\r\nIn Montana I had a horse, which was hobbled every night to keep him\r\nfrom wandering; that is, straps joined by a short chain were put\r\naround his forefeet, so that he could only hop. The hobbles were\r\ntaken off in the morning, but he would still hop until he saw his\r\nmate trotting off.\r\n\r\nThis book is intended to show how any one can trot off if he will.\r\n\r\nIt is not a textbook; there are plenty of good textbooks, which are\r\nreferred to herein. Intensive cultivation cannot be comprised in any\r\none book.\r\n\r\nIt shows what is needed for a city man or woman to support a family\r\non the proceeds of a little bit of land; it shows how in truth, as\r\nthe old Book prophesied, the earth brings forth abundantly after its\r\nkind to satisfy the desire of every living thing. It is not\r\nnecessary to bury oneself in the country, nor, with the new\r\nfacilities of transportation, need we, unless we wish to, pay the\r\nextravagant rents and enormous cost of living in the city. A little\r\nbit of land near the town or the city can be rented or bought on\r\neasy terms; and merchandising will bring one to the city often\r\nenough. Neither is hard labor needed; but it is to work alone that\r\nthe earth yields her increase, and if, although unskilled, we would\r\nsucceed in gardening, we must attend constantly and intelligently to\r\nthe home acres.\r\n\r\nEvery chapter of this book has been revised by a specialist, and the\r\nauthors wish to express their appreciation of the aid given them,\r\nparticularly by Mr. E. H. Moore, Arboriculturist in the Brooklyn\r\nDepartment of Parks; Mr. Collingwood of the Rural New Yorker and Mr.\r\nGeorge T. Powell; and to thank Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, and also\r\nMr. Joseph Morwitz, for many valuable suggestions; also all those\r\nfrom whom we have quoted directly or in substance.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavored in the text to give full acknowledgment to all,\r\nbut in some cases it has been impossible to credit to the originator\r\nevery paragraph or thought, since these have been selected and\r\nplaced as needed, believing that all true teachers and gardeners are\r\nmore anxious to have their message sent than to be seen delivering\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn truth, teaching is but another department of gardening.\r\n\r\nPractical points and criticisms from practical men and women,\r\nespecially from those experiences in trying to get to the land, will\r\nbe welcomed by the authors. Address in care of the publishers.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Country Life Commission, with Special Message from\r\nthe President of the United States, is especially important as\r\nshowing the connection of Intensive Cultivation with Thrift for war\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt tells us that:\r\n\r\n\"The handicaps (on getting out of town) that we now have specially\r\nin mind may be stated under four heads: Speculative holding of\r\nlands; monopolistic control of streams; wastage and monopolistic\r\ncontrol of forests; restraint of trade.\r\n\r\n\"Certain landowners procure large areas of agricultural land in the\r\nmost available location, sometimes by questionable methods, and hold\r\nit for speculative purposes. This not only withdraws the land itself\r\nfrom settlement, but in many cases prevents the development of an\r\nagricultural community. The smaller landowners are isolated and\r\nunable to establish their necessary institutions or to reach the\r\nmarket. The holding of large areas by one party tends to develop a\r\nsystem of tenantry and absentee farming. The whole development may\r\nbe in the direction of social and economic ineffectiveness.\r\n\r\n\"A similar problem arises in the utilization of swamp lands.\r\nAccording to the reports of the Geological Survey, there are more\r\nthan 75,000,000 acres of swamp land in this country, the greater\r\npart of which are capable of reclamation at probably a nominal cost\r\nas compared to their value. It is important to the development of\r\nthe best type of country life that the reclamation proceed under\r\nconditions insuring subdivision into small farms and settlement by\r\nmen who would both own them and till them.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these lands are near the centers of population. They become\r\na menace to health, and they often prevent the development of good\r\nsocial conditions in very large areas. As a rule they are extremely\r\nfertile. They are capable of sustaining an agricultural population\r\nnumbering many millions, and the conditions under which these\r\nmillions must live are a matter of national concern. The Federal\r\nGovernment should act to the fullest extent of its constitutional\r\npowers in the reclamation of these lands under proper safeguards\r\nagainst speculative holding and landlordism.\r\n\r\n\"The rivers are valuable to the farmers as drainage lines, as\r\nirrigation supply, as carriers and equalizers of transportation\r\nrates, as a readily available power resource, and for raising food\r\nfish. The wise development of these and other uses is important to\r\nboth agricultural and other interests; their protection from\r\nmonopoly is one of the first responsibilities of government. The\r\nstreams belong to the people; under a proper system of development\r\ntheir resources would remain an estate of all the people, and become\r\navailable as needed.\r\n\r\n\"River transportation is not usually antagonistic to railway\r\ninterests. Population and production are increasing rapidly, with\r\ncorresponding increase in the demands made on transportation\r\nfacilities. It may be reasonably expected that the river will\r\neventually carry a large part of the freight that does not require\r\nprompt delivery, while the railway will carry that requiring\r\nexpedition. This is already foreseen by leading railway men; and its\r\nimportance to the farmer is such that he should encourage and aid,\r\nby every means in his power, the large use of the rivers. The\r\ncountry will produce enough business to tax both streams and\r\nrailroads to their utmost.\r\n\r\n\"In many regions the streams afford facilities for power, which,\r\nsince the inauguration of electrical transmission, is available for\r\nlocal rail lines and offers the best solution of local\r\ntransportation problems. In many parts of the country local and\r\ninterurban lines are providing transportation to farm areas, thereby\r\nincreasing facilities for moving crops and adding to the profit and\r\nconvenience of farm life. However, there seems to be a very general\r\nlack of appreciation of the possibilities of this water-power\r\nresource as governing transportation costs.\r\n\r\n\"The streams may be also used as small water power on thousands of\r\nfarms. This is particularly true of small streams. Much of the labor\r\nabout the house and barn can be performed by transmission of power\r\nfrom small water wheels running on the farms themselves or in the\r\nneighborhood. This power could be used for electric lighting and for\r\nsmall manufacture. It is more important that small power be\r\ndeveloped on the farms of the United States than that we harness\r\nNiagara.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, the tendency of the present laws is to encourage the\r\nacquisition of these resources on easy terms, or on their own terms,\r\nby the first applicants, and the power of the streams is rapidly\r\nbeing acquired under conditions that lead to the concentration of\r\nownership in the hands of the monopolies. This constitutes a real\r\nand immediate danger, not to the country-life interests alone, but\r\nto the entire nation, and it is time that the whole people become\r\naroused to it.\r\n\r\n\"The forests have been exploited for private gain not only until the\r\ntimber has been seriously reduced, but until streams have been\r\nruined for navigation, power, irrigation, and common water supplies,\r\nand whole regions have been exposed to floods and disastrous soil\r\nerosion. Probably there has never occurred a more reckless\r\ndestruction of property that of right should belong to all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\"The wood-lot property of the country needs to be saved and\r\nincreased. Wood-lot yield is one of the most important crops of the\r\nfarms, and is of great value to the public in con trolling streams,\r\nsaving the run-off, checking winds, and adding to the attractiveness\r\nof the region. [Taken up in a special chapter of this book.]\r\n\r\n\"In many regions where poor and hilly lands prevail, the town or\r\ncounty could well afford to purchase forest land, expecting thereby\r\nto add to the value of the property and to make the forests a source\r\nof revenue. Such communal forests in Europe yield revenue to the\r\ncities and towns by which they are owned and managed.\"\r\n\r\nThese revenues would furnish good roads even in the poorest and most\r\nsparsely settled districts.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other reasons why people do not like to live\r\noutside of cities--or do not succeed in farm work. There is the\r\ndifficulty of finding help. This, however, rejoices the heart of\r\nthe modern sociologist. Consider--we first teach our children\r\nindependence and train them for everything but farm help or\r\nhousehold services. Then we degrade the \"help\" below a mill \"hand\"\r\nso that people will not even sit at table with them at an hotel.\r\nNext we fix a theory of conduct for them that keeps them constantly\r\nunder orders and pay them wages that make it hardly possible for\r\nthem to rise above the station to which we have appointed them.\r\n\r\nFinally, when we move away from the haunts of men out to\r\nSandtown-by-the-Puddle we blame them that they do not rush to join\r\nus. Most of them would be happier in penal servitude than in the\r\ncountry. The work is as hard and requires as much skill as a\r\nmechanic's work, besides personal qualities that are demanded of no\r\nmechanic, and commands half its wages.\r\n\r\nThose who, like Henry Ford, can afford to pay mechanics' wages for\r\nhelp can get all they want.\r\n\r\nMany people go to the country without plan, preparation, or\r\nvocation, to make a living. They usually start to build a bungalow\r\nbut seldom get further than the bungle. Don't build anything without\r\nplan. Get a comfortable house proof against cold and heat as soon as\r\npossible and, above all, well ventilated. At present the air in the\r\ncountry is good, because the farmers shut all the bad air up in\r\ntheir bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThey say\r\n\r\n  \"The farmer works from sun to sun\r\n  For the summer's work is never done.\"\r\n\r\nWe might add, it's never even half done--naturally. A donkey engine\r\ncan work like that, but then it hasn't any brains. No man can work\r\nfrom sun to sun all summer and think at all or be good for anything\r\nat the end of it.\r\n\r\nAbove all things don't work long hours, even in learning, with the\r\nidea of saving that way. All up-to-date employers are agreed that an\r\neight-hour day produces more and better results than a ten-hour day\r\nand that a twelve-hour day brings sheriffs and suicides instead of\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nThat's just as true of the individual worker as it is of the factory\r\n\"hand.\" Yet most men and a few women proudly say that they \"work\r\nlike a horse\" (it's usually not true). They don't; a horse won't\r\nwork and can't work over eight hours a day steadily. Neither can\r\nyou: you may keep buzzing around much longer--but the best work\r\nrequires the best conditions and the best hours. You think, or you\r\nflatter yourself that you think, that it is necessary; but nothing\r\nis necessary that is stupid and wrong. It is hardly too much to say\r\nthat when we are tired out or ill either we have been doing the\r\nwrong thing or doing it wrong.\r\n\r\nThere is besides, as an anti-rusticant, railroad discrimination in\r\nfavor of long hauls, but the main reason that the small farms of the\r\nEastern Coast are less settled than those farther west is the great\r\ndifficulty in getting farm loans or loans on farm buildings. New\r\nYork companies and others in the great cities will loan on farms\r\nwest of the Alleghenies, but even the otherwise excellent eastern\r\nBuilding Loan Associations usually restrict themselves to places\r\nwithin twenty-five miles of a city. The Jewish Agricultural and\r\nIndustrial Aid Society will help approved Jewish farmers to buy and\r\nbuild: and there is a Federal Land Bank in Springfield, Mass., which\r\nlends to some Farmers' Associations, of which some four thousand are\r\nalready formed. It is hoped that the State Land Bank of New York\r\nCity may improve the situation in New York for Farmers'\r\nOrganizations, but \"generally nearly all available funds of the\r\nlocal banks seem to be drawn off for investments in Wall Street.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not to be forgotten that this difficulty is reflected\r\nin the lower prices of eastern Land.\r\n\r\nOne more thing that keeps many people from the country and drives\r\nsome people back to the city is the mosquito (of course there are\r\nmosquitoes in town, but we are not out as much, so we notice them\r\nless). Mosquitoes breed or rather we breed them, in still water in\r\nwhich there are no fish, in pools, hollows in trees, wells, etc.,\r\nand above all in old tin cans. They can no more breed without water\r\nthan sharks could.\r\n\r\nMosquitoes do not breed in grass, but rank growths of weeds or grass\r\nmay conceal small breeding puddles, and form a favorite nursery for\r\nMamma Skeet. A teacupful of water standing ten days is enough for\r\n250 wrigglers; their needs are modest.\r\n\r\nDifferent species of mosquitoes have as well-defined habits as other\r\nbirds and are classified as follows: Domestic, Migratory, and\r\nWoodland.\r\n\r\nThe common domestic or pet species breed in fresh water, usually in\r\nthe house yard, fly comparatively short distances, and habitually\r\nenter houses. They winter in cellars, barns, and outhouses. Some of\r\nthem are conveyors of malaria.\r\n\r\nThe Migratory Species breed on the salt marshes, fly long distances,\r\ndo not habitually enter houses, and are not carriers of diseases so\r\nfar as known.\r\n\r\nCertain varieties of Woodland Mosquitoes breed only in woodland\r\npools, appearing in the early spring, and travel a greater distance\r\nthan the domestic species. They are not usually troublesome indoors.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that malaria is transmitted only by certain\r\nspecies of Anopheles, one of which is the domestic mosquito.\r\nEliminate this one species of mosquito and the disease will\r\ndisappear as a direct consequence. So if you hear that pretty little\r\nsong in the house, don't swear, thank the Lord that effects always\r\nfollow causes. You need never be without a bite in the house if you\r\nhave a nice cesspool handy for Sis Mosquito, for each one will have\r\na first-class feed with you every second or third day.\r\n\r\nThey are needless and dangerous pests or pets. Their propagation can\r\nbe prevented by draining or filling wet areas, by emptying or\r\nscreening water receptacles, and by spraying with oil where better\r\nmeasures are not available. Oil should be sprinkled in any\r\ncesspools, sewers, and catch basins, rain barrels, water troughs,\r\nroof gutters, marshes, swamps, and puddles that cannot be done away\r\nwith. All ponds and large bodies of water should have clean sharp\r\nedges, because in shallow, grassy edges larvae of the malarial\r\nspecies are commonly found. Large ponds with clean edges, inhabited\r\nby fish or predatory insects, are safe; smaller ponds, if wind\r\nswept, and all ponds in the \"ripple area\" are safe. All rain pools,\r\nstagnant gutters, overgrown edges of large ponds, and all\r\nreceptacles holding water not constantly renewed, are dangerous. You\r\nraise most of your own mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nNow a word specially concerning this revised edition.\r\n\r\nThe farm papers are supported mainly by men with large acreage, it\r\nis the rise in value of these acres more than the rise in farm\r\nproducts that has pulled the land-owning farmers out of the hole\r\nthat they were in up to about the year 1900. Farmers' knowledge,\r\nliking, and equipment was for big fields, half cultivated, and at\r\nfirst they did not like to hear that they had been wasting so much\r\nof the labor that had bent their backs. Nor did they want to hear\r\nthat it would have been far more profitable to them to have\r\ncultivated a few acres and left the goats and hogs or sheep to\r\nattend to the rest as wild land until the long-expected settlers\r\ncame along to buy the land at dreamland prices.\r\n\r\nConsequently, all the faults in the book there were, and some more\r\nbesides, have been picked out by these critics. It is surprising as\r\nwell as a notable compliment to the agricultural experts who revised\r\nthe first edition that, with one exception, no material error or\r\nomission has been pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe more so because there is absolutely no limit to the advances in\r\nmethods and results in doing things, and in growing things, all born\r\nof intelligent toil. Your suggestions may help the world to better\r\nand bigger things. If you will listen at the 'phone you may sometime\r\nhear a conversation like this:\r\n\r\n\"Hello, this is Mrs. Wise, send me two strawberries, please.\" \"You'd\r\nbetter take three, Madam, I've none larger than peaches to-day.\"\r\n\"All right; good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nYou may sometime see that kind of strawberry in New Jersey at\r\nKevitt's Athenia, or Henry Joralamon's, or in the berry known by\r\nvarious names, such as Giant and different Joe's. But lots of people\r\nhave failed in their war garden work even on common things; lots\r\nmore ought to have failed but haven't--yet. Years ago, we, the book\r\nand its helpers, started the forward-to-the-land movement which has\r\nresulted in probably two million extra garden patches this war year.\r\nI have had carloads of letters, at least hand carloads, about the\r\nbook, but not one worker who even tried to follow its counsels has\r\nreported failure.\r\n\r\nSo don't let us have a wail from you because your \"garden stuff\r\nnever comes up.\" Of course it doesn't; you have to bring it up, just\r\nlike a baby. That's what I've been crying for long years in the\r\nwilderness ever since the first edition of this book. The Three\r\nAcres may be bought on credit but eternal vigilance is the price of\r\nLiberty and crops. To raise good crops costs time and attention and\r\nsweat of body and of brains.\r\n\r\nHere is a chunk of wisdom out of the excellent Garden Primer (which\r\nyou can get free by asking me for it):\r\n\r\n\"One hour a day spent in a garden ten yards long by seven wide will\r\nsupply vegetables enough for a family of six\"; but the value of this\r\nremark lies in the application of it. If you figure a bit on that\r\nyou will find that ten minutes a day will provide enough for one\r\nperson, but six hours once a week won't do. Six hours a day will\r\nbring up a baby; but two days a week is criminal neglect for the\r\nother five days. If you once let the weeds get a good start, say\r\nafter a rain, they will make even the angels swear. It's regular\r\nattention that the baby and the garden and your education and your\r\nbest girl will require.\r\n\r\nIf you want more minute instructions about how to grow each\r\nvegetable, put in words that anybody can understand without getting\r\na headache or a dictionary, look up \"The Garden Yard\" by the Author.\r\nIt is in nearly all libraries now, and it is the only book that\r\nmakes perfectly plain everything that a plain man needs to know\r\nabout growing plain things.\r\n\r\nSo there is little to add in this new edition except to reinforce\r\nwhat was not strong enough. In the present jumping market to revise\r\nthe prices quoted would be absurd, but it may be noted that, as in\r\nthe prices of 'cowers, the minimum prices are still about correct,\r\nbut the maximum prices have jumped almost out of sight. Every year\r\nthere are more and more very wealthy people who will pay nearly any\r\nprice for the very best. The world seems to be dividing into those\r\nwho have to count their pennies and those who couldn't count their\r\nthousands. Of course, where war has prohibited the importation of\r\nthe strong bulbs and roots needed for forcing flowers, the prices\r\nare about what any one who has any chooses to ask. Monopoly can\r\nalways get its own price.\r\n\r\nThis New Edition does not attempt to bring prices quoted up to date.\r\nIn these times not even a stock exchange telegraph ticker can do\r\nthat. Prices of goods in general have advanced at least 80 per cent.\r\nBy the day that this book is off the press they may have decreased,\r\nor more likely advanced some more. The next day they may slump.\r\nPrices of labor advance more slowly and do not slump so fast. Wages\r\nof men gardeners have risen perhaps 50 per cent in the last ten\r\nyears, but women and children have learned to do much of the work.\r\nThey do the work cheaper because most of them have some one on whom\r\nthey can partly depend for support.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when an example of total product given in the earlier\r\nedition is still typical and has stood investigation, it is not\r\ndiscarded in favor of a more modern instance.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy to have revised all the figures, but of\r\nlittle advantage to our readers. For example, it is encouraging to\r\nthe citizen to know that the average wheat yield per acre has\r\nincreased more than two bushels since the first edition of this\r\nbook, but it would not help the garden maker. The increase of\r\npossible products tends to counterbalance the increased cost of\r\nlabor. So only the musty parts have been cut out of the book, which\r\nis more needed now than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I: Making a Living--Where and How\r\n\r\nChapter II: Present Conditions\r\n\r\nChapter III: How To Buy The Farm\r\n\r\nChapter IV: Vacant City Lot Cultivation\r\n\r\nChapter V: Results To Be Expected\r\n\r\nChapter VI: What An Acre May Produce\r\n\r\nChapter VII: Some Methods\r\n\r\nChapter VIII: The Kitchen Garden\r\n\r\nChapter IX: Tools And Equipment\r\n\r\nChapter X: Advantages From Capital\r\n\r\nChapter XI: Hotbeds And Greenhouses\r\n\r\nChapter XII: Other Uses Of Land\r\n\r\nChapter XIII: Fruits\r\n\r\nChapter XIV: Flowers\r\n\r\nChapter XV: Drug Plants\r\n\r\nChapter XVI: Novel Live Stock\r\n\r\nChapter XVII: Where To Go\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII: Clearing The Land\r\n\r\nChapter XIX: How To Build\r\n\r\nChapter XX: Back To The Land\r\n\r\nChapter XXI: Coming Profession For Boys\r\n\r\nChapter XXII: The Wood Lot\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII: Some Practical Experiments\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV: Some Experimental Foods\r\n\r\nChapter XXV: Dried Truck\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI: Home Cold Pack Canning\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII: Retail Cooperation\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII: Summer Colonies For City People\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMAKING A LIVING--WHERE AND HOW\r\n\r\n\r\nBy thought and courage, we can help ourselves to own a home,\r\nsurrounded by acres of fruit and vegetables, flowers and poultry,\r\nand learn the best methods so as to insure success.\r\n\r\nIn olden times any one could \"farm,\" but it is necessary to-day to\r\nteach people to obtain a livelihood directly from the earth.\r\nScientific methods of agriculture have revealed possibilities in the\r\nsoil that make farming the most fascinating occupation known to man.\r\nPeople in every city are longing for the freedom of country life,\r\nyet hesitate to enter into its liberty because no one points the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMost sociologists are agreed that the great problem of our day is to\r\nstop the drift of population toward the cities. Seeing the\r\novercrowding, the want and misery of our great towns, the\r\nphilanthropist chimes in with \"Get the people to the country, that\r\nis the need.\"\r\n\r\nBut there is no such need. Man is a social animal, he naturally goes\r\nin flocks, he earns more and learns more in crowds. To transport him\r\nto the country, even if he would stay, which happily he won't, would\r\nbe to doctor a symptom. As in typhoid, what is needed is not to\r\nsuppress the fever, that is easy, but to remove the cause of it.\r\n\r\nIt is not the growth of the cities that we want to check, but the\r\nneedless want and misery in the cities, and this can be done by\r\nrestoring the natural condition of living, and among other things,\r\nby showing that it is easier and making it more attractive to live\r\nin comfort on the outskirts of the city as producers, than in the\r\nslums as paupers.\r\n\r\nWe know already that the natural and healthy life is, that in the\r\nsweat of our faces we should eat bread. We observe that everything\r\nwe eat or use or make comes from the earth by labor; but no one\r\nknows how abundantly the Mother can supply her children. It is well\r\nsaid that no man yet knows the capacity of a square yard of earth.\r\n\r\nThe farmer thinks that he has done well if he gets a hundred and\r\nfifty or two hundred bushels of potatoes from an acre; he does not\r\nknow that others have gotten 1284 bushels.\r\n\r\n(\"Mr. Knight, whose name is well known to every horticulturist in\r\nEngland, Once dug out of his fields no less than 1284 bushels of\r\npotatoes, or thirty-four tons and nine hundreds weight (about 34\r\nbushels to the ton), on a single acre; and at a recent competition\r\nin Minnesota, 1120 bushels, or thirty tons, could be ascertained as\r\nhaving been grown on one acre.\" P. Kropotkin's \"Fields, Factories\r\nand Workshops,\" page 114.)\r\n\r\nLet us realize what an acre means. An acre is a square about 209\r\nfeet each way, 4840 square yards of land. A New York City avenue\r\nblock is about 200 feet long from house corner to house corner. It\r\nhas eight city lots 25 X 100 in its front; about double that space\r\n(17-2/5 lots) makes an acre.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary one-horse cart holds twenty bushels, so then a full crop\r\nof potatoes from that space would fill 56 carts.\r\n\r\nTo raise potatoes as an ordinary farmer raises them, requires him to\r\ngo over the ground not less than a dozen times, plowing, harrowing,\r\nmarking, planting, cultivating, three times weeding, three times for\r\nbugs, and digging; it would pay him to go over it much oftener.\r\n\r\nIf he plants his rows of potatoes three feet apart, to allow for\r\nhorse cultivation, he has 69 rows of 200 feet each; which makes him\r\nwalk at least thirty-three miles over each acre. If he has a\r\ntwenty-acre lot in potatoes, he walks each year more than 650 miles\r\nover the field and gets, let us say, 150 bushels of poor potatoes\r\nper acre, or 3000 bushels off his twenty-acre field.\r\n\r\nNow suppose he cultivates the soil, instead of just \"raising a\r\ncrop,\" and gets 600 bushels of fine potatoes to the acre, he need\r\nplant only five acres, walk only 200 miles, and, because his\r\npotatoes are choice and early, get many times the price that his\r\npedestrian neighbor gets. It is much easier to grow 200,000 lb. of\r\nfeed on one acre than to grow them on ten acres.\r\n\r\nTo cultivate is to watch the soil as you would watch your cooking\r\nand to tend the crop as you would tend your animals. The crop is as\r\nalive as the stock and as easily gets sick.\r\n\r\nIf an ordinary farmer rents 60 acres at $5.00 per acre, a moderate\r\nrent for good land, he pays out in cash $300, besides farm wages. If\r\nhe buys it, his interest and taxes will amount to nearly as much;\r\nbut if he tills but five acres intelligently, he can get as much out\r\nof it as out of an ordinary farm, and even if his rent be as high as\r\n$30 per acre for well situated land, he is $150 to the good;\r\nbesides, doing the work himself, he has no drain of capital for\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nLarge barns and shelter for help being unnecessary, he can live in a\r\ncheap shack till he accumulates enough for proper buildings. Many of\r\nthe successful vacant lot farmers live in a tent or in shanties made\r\nof old boxes and such like.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we have the knowledge and ability and the capital and\r\ncan give it the attention, it is more profitable to cultivate on a\r\nlarge scale than on a small one, because in that case each worker\r\nnecessarily produces more than he gets as wages--and we pocket the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nMost American farmers are holding land that somebody ought to pay\r\nthem a bonus for working, else they must come out of the little end\r\nof the horn. They get poor or poorly situated land, because it costs\r\nless, and then put three or four hundred dollars' worth of labor and\r\nmoney a year into the land and take out four or five hundred\r\ndollars' worth of crops.\r\n\r\nThe farmer thinks he must have big fields to feed his cattle, and\r\nthat he must have cattle to keep the big fields fertilized, so he\r\nraises hay.\r\n\r\nIn that he makes two mistakes; hay, like most other low-priced\r\ncrops, is risky--the cost of harvesting is high and the margin of\r\nprofit small. A week of wet weather at cutting time or the\r\nimpossibility of getting enough men and machines in the week when it\r\nshould be cut, may make a loss.\r\n\r\nBut the scientific dairy man does not take that risk, nor let his\r\ncattle use up this fodder by wandering over the fields in search of\r\ntid-bits of grass or clover, or, goaded by the flies, trampling more\r\ngrass than they eat and wasting their manure.\r\n\r\nHe keeps the cows in cool sheds, feeds them on cut fodder, and saves\r\nevery ounce of the manure.\r\n\r\nThe modern cow is a ruminating machine for producing milk and cares\r\nlittle for exercise and needs little. To exploit the cattle as\r\nemployers exploit the factory hands, he gives the cows a cool, shady\r\nplace and food, and they stand there all day long to their profit\r\nand his.\r\n\r\n(United States Agricultural Bulletin No. 22 says: \"The New Jersey\r\nExperiment Station has been conducting a practical trial in soiling\r\ndairy cows for a number of years past, and finds that complete\r\nsoiling is entirely practicable, i.e. that green foliage crops may\r\nserve as the sole food of the dewy herd, aside from the grain\r\nration, without injury to the animals and with a considerable saving\r\nin the cost of milk.\r\n\r\n\"Under the soiling system a large number of animals can be kept upon\r\na given acreage and by allowing open-air exercises in a large yard\r\nor pasture the practice has been demonstrated as entirely feasible\r\nfor dairy animals.\r\n\r\n\"One acre of soiling crops produced sufficient fodder for an\r\nequivalent of 3 cows for six months. Rye, corn, crimson clover,\r\nalfalfa, oats and peas, and millets have been found to furnish food\r\nmore economically than any other green crops in that locality. A\r\ngrain rotation was always fed in addition to the soiling crops.\")\r\n\r\nAlthough we can feed a cow on less than an acre by raising forage\r\ncrops, she needs to be milked every day at regular hours, and the\r\nmilk, as well as the cans and the cow, need to be cared for--and she\r\ncannot wait.\r\n\r\nThe stock-raiser has a different proposition; he needs fields and\r\ngrass; but if time and available labor is limited, we had better\r\nspecialize on the garden--unlike the farmers.\r\n\r\nThe farmers are not to blame that they do not usually cultivate the\r\nland intelligently. They are mostly cut off from the educational\r\nadvantages of the cities by distance and by bad roads.\r\n\r\nUsually, that is because, desirable land being held at speculative\r\nprices, they are forced to places where the farm itself is worth\r\nless than the good improvements on it cost. Sometimes it is because,\r\nalso, the land is poor or worn out; more often because it is\r\nthoughtlessly managed, nearly always because the land-hungry farmer\r\nhas taken ten times as much land as he needs for farming. In the\r\nhope of a rise that often does not come, nearly all have bought more\r\nland than they can take good care of with limited capital and\r\nscarcity of help.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the farms have held out such poor prospects of fortune\r\nthat the smarter and more enterprising boys and girls have left them\r\nfor the towns, leaving behind the duller and more conservative to\r\nthe mercy of the railroads and other monopolies. What wonder, then,\r\nthat the overworked and struggling farmer finds little chance to\r\nstudy, or to investigate and invest in fertilizers or even in modern\r\nmethods of agriculture.\r\n\r\nNo wonder farming does not pay if a \"farmer\" means a stupid man with\r\nneither training for, nor knowledge of, his business. Those who have\r\nthe knowledge seldom have the experience and those who have the\r\nexperience seldom have the knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe bonanza farms of the West are other samples of great areas of\r\nthe most productive land in the United States being used most\r\nunscientifically. By the methods used, the land produces less per\r\nacre than land in the East which is not so good. Accordingly, we\r\nfind that the bonanza farm plan, where great areas of wheat are\r\nworked by machines with labor employed only in the seed time and\r\nharvest, is rapidly breaking up. As the land becomes valuable and is\r\ntaxed, such wasteful, wholesale methods do not pay as well as it\r\npays to rent or sell the land to farmers, who each for themselves\r\nattend to details of the business. Consequently, most of those farms\r\nare being sold off. The whole amount of wheat ever raised on them,\r\nhowever, is small compared to the rice, millet, and wheat raised in\r\nChina, India, and Russia, and is insignificant compared to the\r\namount of produce grown on the myriad little farm plots.\r\n\r\nA comparison of productions as taken from the 12th and 13th United\r\nStates Censuses in the bonanza farm states shows that the yield of\r\nwheat was:\r\n\r\nwhile New England shows 23.5 bu. per acre.\r\n\r\n                    In 1899                In 1909\r\n\r\n  Minnesota         14.5 bu. per acre      17.4\r\n  North Dakota      13.5 bu. per acre      14.3\r\n  South Dakota      10.5 bu. per acre      14.6\r\n\r\nBy 1917 these largely increased, but the differences remain.\r\n\r\n\"The average extent of land tilled by one family in Japan does not\r\nexceed one hectare\" (2.471 acres), less than two and a half acres.\r\n(\"Japan in the Beginning of the Twentieth Century,\" page 89.\r\nPublished by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce of Japan.)\r\n\r\n\"Farm households contain on an average 5.8 persons, of whom two and\r\na half persons per family may be regarded of an age capable of doing\r\neffective work.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that here we have more than one person working on each acre and\r\neach acre supporting more than two persons, notwithstanding that\r\ntheir 22,000,000 tenant farmers pay sometimes four fifths of their\r\nproduct as rent.\" (Same, page 103.)\r\n\r\nDenmark, one of the best agricultural countries and probably one of\r\nthe happiest communities on earth, reported\r\n\r\n  1,900 farms of 250-300 acres,\r\n  74,000 farms averaging 100 acres,\r\n  150,000 farms averaging 7 to 10 acres,\r\n  1,050 cooperative dairies, and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd so impressed has the ruling class there become with the\r\nadvantage of this that the Government will supply the poor worker\r\nnine tenths of the means necessary to buy a small farm.\r\n\r\nSays Kropotkin, \"the small island of Jersey, eight miles long and\r\nless than six miles wide, still remains a land of open field\r\nculture; but, although it comprises only 28,707 acres (nearly 45\r\nsquare miles), rocks included, it nourishes a population of about\r\ntwo inhabitants to each acre, or 1300 inhabitants to the square\r\nmile, and there is not one writer on agriculture who, after having\r\npaid a visit to this island, does not praise the well-being of the\r\nJersey peasants and the admirable results which they obtain in their\r\nsmall farms of from five to twenty acres--very often less than five\r\nacres--by means of a rational and intensive culture.\r\n\r\n\"Most of my readers will probably be astonished to learn that the\r\nsoil of Jersey, which consists of decomposed granite, with no\r\norganic matter in it, is not at all of surprising fertility, and\r\nthat its climate, though more sunny than the climate of the British\r\nIsles, offers many drawbacks on account of the small amount of sun\r\nheat during the summer and of the cold winds in spring.\"\r\n\r\n(\"The successes accomplished lately in Jersey are entirely due to\r\nthe amount of labor which a dense population is putting on the land;\r\nto a system of land-tenure, land-transference, and inheritance very\r\ndifferent from those which prevail elsewhere; to freedom from State\r\ntaxation; and to the fact that communal institutions have been\r\nmaintained down to quite a recent period, while a number of communal\r\nhabits and customs of mutual support, derived there-from, are alive\r\nto the present time.\" (\"Fields, Factories and Workshops.\")\r\n\r\n\"It will suffice to say that on the whole the inhabitants of Jersey\r\nobtain agricultural products to the value of $250 to each acre of\r\nthe aggregate surface of land.\" (Same, page 113.))\r\n\r\nIn a small plot the character of the soil is of little consequence.\r\nWe hear of one garden in New York City on the roof of a big building\r\nwhere the janitor smuggled up the needed soil in baskets.\r\n\r\nThe school gardens in New York City, some in a space as small as a\r\nhearth rug, one yard by two, show how to use a very small patch of\r\nland to the best advantage. Nor need it take more time than you can\r\nafford.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the cultivators of city lots on Long Island who kept count\r\nof the number of days they worked, show the surprising conclusion\r\nthat they earned, not farm wages (seventy-five cents a day with\r\nboard and lodging for the worker), but mechanics' wages (four\r\ndollars per day) for every working day; as, for instance, a\r\nstone-cutter, assisted by his two boys, worked fifty hours and made\r\n$120.23.\" (\"Cultivation of Vacant Lots, New York,\" page 12); and\r\nfour city lots is a very little farm.\r\n\r\nBut though one may not own even a little farm, almost any one who\r\nwants to can have a home garden--it needs but a small plot of land.\r\nNor need we be discouraged because acquaintances who play at\r\ngardening tell us that their vegetables cost them more than if they\r\nbought them.\r\n\r\nThey naturally would, with thoughtless methods of cultivation, with\r\nthe selection of crops and the purchase of seeds left to an\r\nuneducated man who does all his work the way he saw his grandfather\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\nNor are we to be discouraged even by the \"gentleman farmer\" who\r\nruns a model farm, a model of how not to do it, for, notwithstanding\r\nits large capital, it seldom pays.\r\n\r\nI am passing such a farm now as I write in the train--it is\r\nsurrounded by a cut stone wall. Do you suppose the owner business\r\nwould pay if it were run in the same way that his farm is run? We\r\nknow the story of the white sparrow to find which would bring luck\r\nto the farm--but it was out only at daybreak; the farmer got up each\r\nmorning to find the sparrow and found a lot of other things to\r\nattend to, which did bring luck to the farm. I don't think the owner\r\nof that wall worked at it, at daybreak.\r\n\r\nThe time is not far distant when the builders of homes in our\r\nAmerican cities will be compelled to leave room for a garden, in\r\norder to meet the requirements of the people In the mad rush for\r\nwealth we have overlooked the natural state, but we see a healthy\r\nreaction setting in. With the improvements in steam and electricity,\r\nthe revolutionizing of transportation, the cutting of the arbitrary\r\ntelephone charges, it is becoming possible to live at a distance\r\nfrom our business. May we not expect in the near future to see one\r\nportion of our cities devoted entirely to business, with the homes\r\nof the people so separated as to give light, sunshine, and air to\r\nall, besides a piece of ground for a garden sufficient to supply the\r\ntable with vegetables?\r\n\r\nYou raise more than vegetables in your garden: you raise your\r\nexpectation of life.\r\n\r\nLife belongs in the garden. Do you remember--the first chapters of\r\nGenesis show us our babyhood in a garden--the garden that all\r\nbabyhood remembers, and the last chapter of the Apocalypse leaves us\r\nwith the vision of the garden in the Holy City, on either side of\r\nthe river, where the trees yield their fruits every month and bear\r\nleaves of universal healing. Just so will it be in our holy cities\r\nof the future--the garden will be right there \"in the midst.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPRESENT CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the Civil War and for some years after, our people were almost\r\nwholly agricultural. National activity contented itself with\r\nsettling and developing the vast areas of the public lands, whose\r\nvirgin richness cried aloud in the wilderness for men.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the government, framed to stimulate rapid occupation\r\nof the public lands, had attracted hordes of settlers over the\r\nmountains from the older states, and immigration flowed in a steady\r\nstream into the valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nA system had grown up in the South almost patriarchal, based upon\r\ncultivation by slave labor of enormous areas devoted exclusively to\r\ncotton. In the North, New England had developed some few centers of\r\nindustry, drawing their support from the manufacture of the great\r\nSouthern staple. New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were growing as\r\noutlets for foreign commerce, but as yet manufacturing flourished\r\nbut feebly and in few localities.\r\n\r\nSuch manufacturing and commercial enterprises as existed had been\r\nlaboriously built up by long years of honest working. The free lands\r\nof the government, by giving laborers an alternative, kept up wages,\r\nforcing employers to bid against each other for labor; and monopoly\r\nthus being checked, individual equality was possible.\r\n\r\nThe mineral resources of Pennsylvania and Ohio were all but\r\nunsuspected, and the calm of a people devoted to the peaceful\r\npursuits of agriculture rested over the country.\r\n\r\nRailroads were few and inefficient: telegraph lines but in their\r\ninfancy. Intercourse among the people, outside of a narrow fringe on\r\nthe Atlantic coast, was cumbersome, and impeded by many obstacles.\r\nPrimitive conditions everywhere prevailed, and communities brooded\r\nin silence, growing stragglingly in sluggish indifference, content\r\nwith coarse food and coarser living.\r\n\r\nSuch, in general, were the conditions up to 1861. Then came the\r\nstorm of shot and shell, the rain of blood, the elemental rage of\r\npassion called the Civil War. There was a total upset of business.\r\nSuch periods of hard times as had occurred prior to that time had\r\nbeen caused by the tinkering of untrained minds with the money\r\nsystem or by land speculation, and not by lack of access to the\r\nriches of nature. After four years our people awoke, as from a\r\nnightmare, to find the old life swept away forever. In the South,\r\nthe Confederates, bitter and sullen, groping amid the ruins of their\r\ninstitutions, sought to find some substitute for the agricultural\r\ndespotism exercised for generations by their slaveholding families.\r\nIn the East, the first families of the Revolution, secure in their\r\npreeminence, assumed again the manufacturing-banking-social\r\nprestige. The far West was still almost unknown, and remained in\r\npossession of the buffalo and the Indian. Settlers poured, in\r\nincreasing numbers on to the unappropriated lands still left in the\r\nstates of the central West, and the center of political power\r\nshifted rapidly to this fertile region.\r\n\r\nAlready men of keen insight foresaw a time when oil, timber, coal,\r\nand iron must become the stay of a vastly expanding industrial\r\nsystem, and bent their energies to secure the chief sources of\r\nsupply. From the nature of their work the men who built railways\r\nfirst became aware of the riches of nature, and aided by an enormous\r\npublic sympathy with their efforts, monopolized all the natural\r\nopportunities of value. Coupled with industrial development was the\r\ngradual appropriation of the land. The time soon arrived when the\r\nlate comers either stayed in the manufacturing centers at the\r\nrailways terminals or were pushed farther and farther away from the\r\ncenters. As the landowning families multiplied, the young men were\r\nconfined to the same choice. Forced off the land, the tendency has\r\nbeen to crowd the brainiest blood of America into the cities. In\r\naddition, the competition of the new Western lands, brought into use\r\nby railway development, has exiled the youth of New England, who\r\nfound in their rocky acres no incentive to toil. They, too, joined\r\nthe ever-increasing flow to the cities, and entered into the savage\r\ncompetition of our great towns.\r\n\r\nIn our time the pendulum has swung to its extreme. At every\r\ndepression of business, armies of the unemployed perish in sight of\r\nthe land they abandoned in the hope of a brighter future. Their\r\nchildren have forgotten the traditions of the soil, and the energies\r\nof our people must now be concentrated to reverse the aimless tide\r\nof human sufferers, which under stress continues to flow city-ward,\r\nand to send it to repeople the silent places whence it came. The\r\nfight will not be easily won. Changes in the national land policy\r\nare imperative. To give one generation privileges which enslave all\r\nwho succeed it, is intolerable and will not be permanently endured.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to determine upon a policy in the quiet of the study;\r\ndifferent is the problem of applying a comprehensive scheme to\r\nrepeople the idle land. In the first place, where is the idle land?\r\nIn all parts of our country it exists in abundance. Almost every\r\nstate in the Union has lands which either have never been alienated,\r\nor which have reverted to the state through nonpayment of taxes. In\r\nthe East, particularly, the competition of Western lands, aided by\r\ndiscriminating freight rates, now so notorious, has resulted in the\r\nabandonment to the mortgagee of vast areas in New York, Connecticut,\r\nNew Hampshire, Maine, and to some extent in New Jersey. These are\r\nnow largely resold.\r\n\r\nDeclining fertility and exorbitant and oppressive transportation\r\ncharges have helped to keep these lands out of use, and some still\r\nlie idle and neglected, to excite the wonder of the social and\r\neconomic student. To use the abandoned lands of the East, equal\r\nrates on agricultural products is a basic necessity.\r\n\r\nThe first step, now well under way, is railroad control by the\r\nGovernment. Equal access to transportation is as essential as equal\r\naccess to land, for transportation is indeed an attribute of land.\r\n\r\nExtending the inquiry westward, the coal and oil areas of\r\nPennsylvania and Ohio are all controlled by a few hands. The\r\noriginal fertility of the farming areas of these states, together\r\nwith the fact that they have been producing for only about a\r\ncentury, has enabled them to hold their own until recently, but now\r\nonly the best located tracts are in maximum production, and this can\r\nbe maintained only by the most advanced agricultural science. In\r\nspite of greater advantages, the crowded cities and deserted country\r\ndistricts are beginning to repeat in the fertile alluvial valleys of\r\nthe interior, the tragic story of the East.\r\n\r\nIn the Mississippi valley, conditions seem better. Values of farming\r\nlands are increasing rapidly; the farms are rich and growing richer;\r\nfood products are cheap and abundant; certain staples are produced\r\nin enormous quantities and sent to feed the cities of the East and\r\nthe industrial population of Europe. The railroads transport these\r\nproducts nearly one thousand miles for the same prices as they\r\ncharge in the East for transporting them one hundred miles. Wealth,\r\nactivity, and political power concentrate at the inlet and outlet of\r\nthe railway funnel, leaving vast areas of unused and unusable land\r\nbetween the terminals. Access to markets determines value. That is\r\nwhy the favored lands of Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin, one to two thousand miles from market, have risen in\r\nvalue to as high as three hundred dollars per acre, and the lands of\r\nNew England, New York, and New Jersey go begging at twenty to sixty\r\ndollars per acre, unless they lie within the artificial prosperity\r\nof the cities.\r\n\r\nFarther west in the irrigated regions of Colorado and Utah,\r\nrestricted areas are held for special fruit crops, at prices ranging\r\nfrom three hundred to two thousand dollars and up, per acre. But\r\nhere, again, monopoly, now a monopoly of natural opportunity, is a\r\nfactor in creating prices; on this, however, the vast irrigation\r\nprojects of the government, bringing into use larger and larger\r\nareas of these favored lands, were expected to exercise a check. Up\r\nto 1918 little has been sold. Their reclamation cost too much.\r\n\r\nThe willingness of the Southern planters to sell their lands, and so\r\nto release them for intensive cultivation, has partly turned the\r\ntide of immigration from the Eastern ports to the South, and the\r\nmarket garden system is reaching increasing areas. The development\r\nof factories to make cotton fabrics and to utilize the formerly\r\nwasted cotton seed by turning it into meal for cattle and other\r\nanimals, as well as into the various food products, such as\r\ncotton-seed oil, cottolene, etc., has stimulated the use of the\r\nwaste land around these budding factory centers, thus tending to\r\nencourage intensive use of small, well-located tracts.\r\n\r\nWith a climate much milder and more equable than that of the\r\nNorthern states, with a potential fertility of soil, equally great\r\nunder proper management, the South is making greater strides than\r\nany other part of the country.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing shows that in every section opportunities of getting\r\nthe people to the land exist. Where a man should go is determined by\r\na variety of things. If he be a newly arrived immigrant used to land\r\nwork in Southern Europe, he would find his best chance in the South;\r\nif a German or Russian, or from any of the Northern European\r\ncountries, he would find the beet-sugar sections of Michigan\r\nColorado, or California more to his liking; if American born,\r\nwithout much knowledge of out-door work, and feeling the need of\r\nsocial life, the cheap farms of New York, New Jersey, and New\r\nEngland would probably be most attractive.\r\n\r\nMany persons write me that I say it is necessary to get good land\r\nnear population or with cheap and assured transportation\r\nfacilities--and that it must not cost more than it is worth for\r\ngardening. \"I find,\" they say, \"that such acres are held as 'lots'\r\nat wildly speculative prices\" and they ask \"Where can I find such\r\nland?\" But this is a book on agricultural use of land. Why land\r\ncosts too much and where the remedy lies are other questions, dealt\r\nwith in my \"Things as They Are.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, probably the best chances now for intensive cultivation are\r\nin New Jersey, in the backwoods of the Middle states now made\r\naccessible by cheap autos--and in the South.\r\n\r\nWhat can be undertaken with good prospects of success will be\r\noutlined in the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUY THE FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the purchase of the land for a home in the country, some\r\nconsideration ought to be given to probable increase in land values.\r\nEven if you are primarily interested in your early sales of produce,\r\nyou will not object to reaping an additional profit from the\r\npresence of other people.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as density of population determines land values, it follows\r\nthat vacant land near a large city at $100 per acre may be cheaper\r\nthan similar land at a distance would be at $10 per acre. If you buy\r\nreal estate, you become a silent partner who does nothing, but takes\r\nmost of the profits of the business of others.\r\n\r\nSome persons see so clearly that money is often easily gotten by\r\ninvesting in land, that sometimes they make mistakes, in trying to\r\nget in. It is as easy to be a lamb in the real estate market as it\r\nis in the stock market.\r\n\r\nForesight, judgment, and experience or luck are essential to success\r\nin real estate dealing, but help, at least in keeping out of danger,\r\nmay be had by following a few simple rules, if one can command a\r\nlittle capital, borrowed or owned.\r\n\r\nThe following points, suggested by a professional land shark, will\r\ncertainly be of interest and possibly of profit to the intending\r\nbuyer. I believe myself that they contain the whole philosophy of\r\nland speculation.\r\n\r\nFor a sure profit buy low-priced land, keeping as near the \"raw\r\nmaterial\" as possible; high-priced property is risky and expensive\r\nto carry. An acre which costs one or two hundred dollars, or ten\r\ndollars per lot, will cost but six to twelve dollars per year to\r\ncarry and half a dollar for taxes, and if a stable does come next\r\nyou, why, you can sell your land for a blacksmith shop.\r\n\r\nBesides this, a ten-dollar lot, if restricted for residence or\r\navailable for business, often advances to $100 in a year; one good\r\nhouse which some one else built near it may raise its value that\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nIf the land _is_ high priced, see that there is some kind of a\r\nbuilding on it; even a shanty will usually bring in enough or save\r\nyou enough by its use to pay the taxes; so you will have that\r\nworking for you whilst you are away.\r\n\r\nIf possible, buy at auction and of reputable people who are not\r\nboomers, or at least buy at forced sale; that is how real estate is\r\nsold when it must be sold. Choose lots level with the curb and on\r\nhigh ground, lest the expense of grading and sewering eat up your\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that in buying land for speculation one really buys the\r\nopportunity to tax other people, by taking part of their earnings in\r\nthe shape of rent or price. Do not then be deluded by boom schemes\r\nin inaccessible or desolate places; choose rather that land which in\r\nthe natural course of events others must have in order to work or to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nHome buying in small communities is safer than in the outskirts of a\r\nlarge city, because public improvements are much less costly. If you\r\nput $500 in a $5000 home and carry the balance on mortgage, an\r\nassessment of $1000 for streets or sewers, which helps the vacant\r\nlots, will probably put you out of business. Whether for use or\r\nspeculation, buy in an established neighborhood or where the\r\ncircumstances and neighbors are such that restrictions or\r\nexpenditures will make its character sure. The increase in your land\r\nvalue depends first upon the presence, then upon the efforts, of\r\nothers; it is by their labor you hope to profit.\r\n\r\nTherefore, buy property on leading thoroughfares; except in a very\r\nsmall section devoted to the residence of millionaires, the price of\r\nresidence property has a limit; even there the merest accident or\r\nthe whim of fashion may destroy the value, but there is no telling\r\nwhat figure business property may reach.\r\n\r\nDo not build unless you have to. It is rare that a building pays\r\nfive per cent net on the value of the land and the cost of the\r\nhouse. \"Who buys a house already wrought, gets many a brick and nail\r\nfor naught.\" If, however, you can get a piece of ground in a growing\r\nneighborhood and live on it till you can sell at an advance, that is\r\nthe safest, and surest of investments. It delivers you from the\r\npower of the landlord.\r\n\r\nLastly--in real estate--don't bite off more than you can chew.\r\n\r\nMost of these rules apply to the purchase of suburban land. In farm\r\nbuying, keep as close to your market as you can. See that railway\r\nfacilities are all right; get land likely to be needed for other\r\npurposes. The best way to begin is by securing all information\r\npossible from state agricultural departments. Write to the\r\nindustrial agents of important railroads traversing the section in\r\nwhich you want to locate. They have detailed information regarding\r\nland, markets, social conditions, etc.; get from the United States\r\nAgricultural Department a map showing the soil survey of the section\r\nof your choice. It must be borne in mind that personal aid is not to\r\nbe expected from State Agricultural Departments, Bureaus of\r\nImmigration, railway companies, or any public agency.\r\n\r\nFrom the big farm agencies run for profit you can get lists of\r\nthousands of properties for sale. Some State Agricultural\r\nDepartments cooperate with real estate men in their own states, by\r\nreferring inquiries for farms to them. Some states issue from time\r\nto time lists of \"abandoned farms,\" but these change so constantly\r\nthat they help but little except in the way of suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhen you start farm-hunting take along a good map. Then you will\r\nknow a few things on your own account. Verify railroad maps and\r\n\"facts,\" as they are often biased. Don't waste your time wandering\r\naround a strange locality by yourself. The local real estate man\r\nknows more about his community than you can learn in five years. In\r\ntrying to find out things for yourself you will waste in aimless\r\njourneys, undertaken in ignorance of real conditions, more time and\r\nmoney than a real estate man's commission amounts to.\r\n\r\nThe only way to form a correct idea of the production of any given\r\nsection is to examine a particular farm in detail. Within\r\nwell-recognized limits, all the farms thereabouts will be found of\r\nsimilar character. Before spending money to look at land, learn all\r\nyou can by correspondence. Whether it is more profitable in the long\r\nrun to buy that good plot of land in a high state of cultivation\r\nwith good buildings on it, at a high price, than to buy this\r\nexhausted piece of land with poor buildings or none at all, is a\r\nquestion for the individual to decide. It depends on your energy,\r\ngrit, age, and how much money you have. It is much easier to take\r\nadvantage of what the other fellow has done, than it is to build\r\nfrom the stump. You must bear in mind, however, that well kept land\r\nin a high state of cultivation seldom goes begging in the market. On\r\nthe whole, if you have the capital to do it, you can make the\r\nbiggest wages by buying rough or neglected land, and hewing it into\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nIf you have a knowledge of soils, you may be able to find land that\r\nwill grow something that no one supposes it will grow. This will be\r\nparticularly useful in the case of land thought to be valueless. The\r\nlands about Miles, Michigan, were considered sterile until some one\r\nfound out that they would grow mint, a valuable crop, which made the\r\nland salable at high prices.\r\n\r\nGet hold of a desirable bit of the earth. All that men wear or eat\r\nor use; everything--shelter, food, tools, and toys comes from the\r\nland by labor. Even the capital used to make more of those things is\r\ntaken from the land. The employer and the capitalist are, at bottom,\r\nonly men who control the land or its products, who own rights of\r\nway, mining rights, or the fee of valuable lands. Thousands have\r\n\"made\" money by finding unexpected products in their land or of\r\ntheir lands, oil, coal, mineral, plants; thousands more because\r\ntheir land was needed by some one else, and they were paid to get\r\nout of the way.\r\n\r\nTo speculate on these chances is risky business; to keep land that\r\nenables you to make good pay while you wait, is profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nVACANT CITY LOT CULTIVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this book, necessarily, we have to take much upon the reports of\r\nothers, checking them by our own judgment and experience. The\r\nstartling accounts of what has been done and is being done on plots\r\nof about a quarter acre to each family, however, can be easily\r\nre-verified by any one who will go or write to Philadelphia, or\r\nexamine any present experiment or model gardens. These show what can\r\nbe done even by unskilled labor, with hardly any capital, on small\r\nplots where the soil was poor, but which are well situated.\r\n\r\nThe directors say: \"The first Vacant Lot Cultivation Associations\r\nwere organized when relief agencies were vainly striving to provide\r\nadequate assistance for the host of unemployed. The cultivation of\r\nvacant city lots by the unemployed had already been tried\r\nsuccessfully in other cities. The first year we provided gardens,\r\nseeds, tools, and instruction only, for about one hundred families\r\non twenty-seven acres of ground. At a total cost to contributors of\r\nabout $1800, our gardeners produced $46,000 worth of crops.\"\r\n\r\nThe applicant is allowed a garden on the sole condition that he\r\ncultivate it well through the season, and that he do not trespass\r\nupon his neighbors. He must respect their right to what their labor\r\nproduces. A failure to observe these rules forfeits his privilege.\r\n\r\nDuring twenty years, more than eight thousand families have been\r\nassisted, many old people who could no longer keep up the rapid pace\r\nof our industrial life, cripples whose physical condition held them\r\nback in the race for work, persons who on account of sickness or\r\nother misfortunes have been thrown out of the competition in modern\r\nbusiness, and unfortunate beings who, though clear in mind and\r\nstrong in muscle, have been forced to the ranks of the\r\nunemployed--these have all had an opportunity opened to them:\r\nopportunity to enjoy all of the fruits from nature's great\r\nstorehouse which their own labor and skill might secure.\r\n\r\nThe war has forced France, Italy, and England similarly to utilize\r\nnatural opportunities for subsistence in their enormous tracts of\r\nunproductive lands. In Mexico all proprietors will be required to\r\ndesignate what they propose to cultivate and the remainder will\r\neither be allotted temporarily for agricultural purposes to those\r\ndesiring them or it will be cultivated under government management.\r\nThere is no remedy like that for poverty.\r\n\r\nThe first man who applied for a vacant lot garden came to the\r\nPhiladelphia office after the announcement in the papers, so weak\r\nand emaciated that the doctor was afraid the poor fellow would be\r\nunable to get out of his office without assistance. He was a widower\r\nwith three girls and a boy, the oldest girl about seventeen.\r\n\r\nHe received a garden which contained only about one fifth of an\r\nacre. Later he observed that a part of another little farm was left\r\nuntouched on account of being very rough, full of holes, and covered\r\nwith stone and bricks. Part of this farm was below the street grade\r\nand subject to overflow, but it was larger than the others--nine\r\ntenths of an acre. He offered to exchange, saying he did not mind\r\nthe extra work.\r\n\r\nHis offer was accepted. In a few days the stones and bricks had been\r\nthrown into the holes and covered with dirt. The low places had been\r\nfilled in. It was a work in which the whole family joined. A small\r\nhouse was rented in the immediate neighborhood in lieu of their one\r\nroom near the foul alleys of the city slum.\r\n\r\nEvery inch of the soil was utilized. A rosy hue took the place of\r\nthe pale, wan cheek of a few months before. And now the harvest has\r\ncome, and the winter's store can be enumerated. Thirty bushels of\r\npotatoes, four bushels of turnips, one bushel of carrots, thirty\r\ngallons of sauerkraut, fifteen gallons of catsup, five gallons of\r\npickled beans, one hundred quarts of canned tomatoes, fifty quarts\r\nof canned corn, twenty quarts of beans, one thousand or more fine\r\ncelery stalks, and many other things. Warm clothing has replaced the\r\nbadly worn garments of nine months ago. A few pieces of furniture\r\nhave been added. The boy has been provided with a small capital for\r\nhis little business. (\"Vacant Lot Cultivation,\" Reprint from N. Y.\r\n_Charities Review._) Better labor would of course get even better\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe personal benefits that have come to a few individual cases, are\r\nlargely the same that all the gardeners enjoyed in New York and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAn old colored woman--a grandmother--who had just been released from\r\none of the hospitals where she had been treated for a long time for\r\npleurisy, asked for a garden. It was more than a mile to the nearest\r\nplot, but she was quite willing to go even that distance if she\r\ncould get a garden. At first, owing to her weakened condition, she\r\nwas forced to work slowly and for short periods only, but a little\r\nassistance enabled her to get a garden started. The work proceeded\r\nso well that more land was added to her small holding, and most of\r\nher waking hours were now spent either in or near the garden,\r\nworking among the tender plants or watching them grow. Before the\r\nseason was half spent she had developed one of the best gardens in\r\nthe whole plot. Her surplus produce became so large that she had to\r\ndevote most of her time to gathering and selling it. Finally she\r\nrented a small shed on a prominent street and passers-by often\r\nstopped, and regular customers came to buy the freshly gathered\r\nproduce, the supply being not only abundant, but of great variety.\r\n\r\nOne of the best gardens, from the standpoint of value of produce as\r\nwell as for the varieties of products it contained and the artistic\r\narrangement, was worked by a man who had but one arm. Many other\r\nsuccessful and profitable gardens were cultivated by men and women\r\nof an age when we generally expect them to depend entirely upon\r\nothers for support.\r\n\r\nMany incidents were found where such habits as drinking and loafing\r\naround saloons and clubs and abusing the family have been checked on\r\naccount of the gardener's time and attention being occupied in the\r\nlittle farm.\r\n\r\nOne of the workers came for work in a condition of mind and body\r\nwhich rendered his services almost worthless. He was scarcely able\r\nto carry on his work for a minute beyond what he was shown. Each new\r\nmove had to be explained constantly, and even then he was often\r\nfound doing the work in the wrong way only a few minutes afterwards.\r\nBefore long, however, he began to see that his place had its\r\nresponsibilities and that the work of Mother Nature depended on his\r\ndoing his part and doing it well. By the time the crops were ready\r\nto gather and market he came to realize that the cost of production\r\nmust come under the amount received from the sale of the produce so\r\nas to prevent loss. By the end of the season he had learned so to\r\nutilize his time and to organize his work and execute our plans that\r\nwe were able to recommend him to a farmer who was looking for a\r\nhandy man about the place.\r\n\r\nIn twenty years our Associations have made demonstrations of the\r\nfollowing facts, each demonstration proving more clearly than the\r\nformer ones:\r\n\r\nFirst. That many people out of employment must have help of some\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nSecond. That a great majority of them prefer self-help, and many\r\nwill take no other. Nearly all are able and willing to improve any\r\nopportunities open to them.\r\n\r\nThird. That to open opportunities to them does not pauperize or\r\ndegrade, but has the opposite effect of elevating and ennobling. It\r\nquickly establishes self-respect and self-confidence. The best and\r\nmost effective way of helping people in need is to open a way\r\nwhereby they may help themselves. The most effective charity is\r\nopportunity accompanied with kindly advice and a personal interest\r\nin those less fortunate than ourselves.\r\n\r\nFourth. That the offering of gardens to the unemployed with proper\r\nsupervision and some assistance by providing seeds, fertilizers, and\r\nplowing accompanied with instruction, is the cheapest and easiest\r\nway of opening opportunities yet devised.\r\n\r\nFifth. That it possesses many advantages in addition to providing\r\nprofitable employment; among others, that the worker must come out\r\ninto the open air and sunshine; must exercise, and put forth\r\nexertion,--all of which are conducive to health, and, most important\r\nof all, he knows that all he raises is to be his own. This is the\r\ngreatest incentive to industry.\r\n\r\nThe Vacant Lot Cultivation system is a school wherein gardeners are\r\ntaught a trade (to most of them a new trade), farming, which offers\r\nemployment for more people than all the other trades and professions\r\ncombined: a trade susceptible of wide diversification and offering\r\nmany fields for specializing. But little capital is required; any\r\nother field would require large outlay. Its greatest advantage,\r\nhowever, is that the idle men and the idle land are already close to\r\neach other--the men can reach their gardens without changing their\r\ndomiciles or being separated from their families.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after several years that the full effect of the\r\nwork was realized. A few gardeners each year from the beginning\r\nhave, after one or two years' experience, taken small farms or plots\r\nof land to cultivate on their own account, or have sought employment\r\non farms near the city; but the number is quite small compared to\r\nthe whole number helped. Now more than ten per cent of those that\r\nhad gardens previously have for the last two years been working on\r\ntheir own account. Out of nearly eight hundred gardeners, more than\r\neighty-five either rented or secured the loan of gardens that season\r\nand cultivated them wholly at their own expense, and many others\r\nwould have done so had suitable land been available. The number of\r\ngardens forfeited on account of poor cultivation or trespassing was\r\nonly two out of 800 plots given out.\r\n\r\nThe first important advance was early in the spring of 1904, when it\r\nbecame known that a large tract of land that had been in gardens for\r\nseveral years would be withdrawn from use. A number of the gardeners\r\ncame together to talk over the situation. One proposed that they\r\nform a club to lease a tract of land and divide it up among\r\nthemselves. The plan was readily agreed to, and a nine-acre tract on\r\nLansdowne Avenue was rented at $15 per acre per annum. Some sixteen\r\nfamilies became interested' and Mr. D. F. Rowe, who had been one of\r\nthe most successful gardeners, became manager They had the land\r\nthoroughly fertilized and plowed, and then subdivided. Some took\r\nseparate allotments, as under the Vacant Lot Association's plan, and\r\nothers worked for the manager at an agreed rate of wages per hour.\r\nThe whole nine acres were thoroughly well cultivated, and a\r\nmagnificent crop harvested.\r\n\r\nAs soon as there was produce for sale, a market was established on\r\nthe ground and a regular delivery system organized which later\r\nattracted much attention. It was carried on by the children, of nine\r\nto twelve years of age, from the various families. Each child was\r\nprovided with a pushcart. There were many and various styles, made\r\nfrom little express wagons, baby coaches, and produce boxes.\r\n\r\nThe children built up their own routes, and went regularly to their\r\ncustomers for orders. They made up the orders, loaded them into\r\ntheir little pushcarts, charged themselves up with the separate\r\namounts in a small book, and at the end of each day's sales each\r\nchild settled with the manager and was paid his commission (twenty\r\nper cent of the receipts) in cash. These little salesmen and\r\nsalesgirls often took home four to five dollars per week and yet\r\nnever worked more than three to five hours per day. The work was\r\ndone under such circumstances that to them it was not work but play.\r\nYou can get the full report from the Philadelphia \"Vacant Lot\r\nCultivation Associations.\" It's interesting.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest value that our little garden has brought us,\" said a\r\nFrench woman, mother of a goodly number of rather small children,\r\n\"has not been in the fine vegetables it has yielded all summer, or\r\nthe good times that I and the children have had in the open air, but\r\nin the glasses of beer and absinthe that my husband hasn't taken.\"\r\n\"Quite right, mother, quite right,\" came from a man near by. \"The\r\nworld can never know the evil we men don't do while we are busy in\r\nour little gardens.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, pillage of crops, which was always urged as an objection to\r\nraising fruits or truck on open grounds, has proved to be a baseless\r\nfear. Where any of the gardeners are allowed to camp or put up\r\nshacks on the patches, theft does not occur and various\r\nsuperintendents repeat that \"the few and trivial cases of stealing\r\nfrom vacant lot plots or school gardens were almost all at the\r\nplaces that were fenced.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps our locks and bolts tend to suggest breaking in.\r\n\r\nThe Garden Primer issued by the New York City Food Supply Committee\r\ngives simple but incomplete directions for planting and tending a\r\nvegetable garden. For those who need that sort of thing, these are\r\njust the sort of thing they need. They will be useful if you do not\r\nfollow them. The Primer tells you how to get some kind of parsnips,\r\nchard, spinach, common onions, radishes, cabbage, lettuce, beets,\r\ntomatoes, beans, turnips, peas, peppers, egg plants, cucumbers,\r\ncorn, and potatoes.\r\n\r\nDon't grow these things, unless it be for your own immediate use.\r\nEvery one grows them and ripens them all at the same time. In many\r\nplaces these are given away or thrown away this year. Grow anything\r\nthat every one wants and has not got, like okra, small fruits, etc.;\r\nyou can get a much better return in cash or in trade than by\r\nspending your time \"like other folks\" who do not think.\r\n\r\nSo I refer to these directions for their instruction, and for your\r\nwarning However, they give the following admirable injunctions.\r\n\r\n\"Help Your Country and Yourself by Raising Your Own Vegetables.\"\r\n\r\nAs we will likely have to send to Europe in coming years as much or\r\neven more food than we did last year, there is only one way to avoid\r\na shortage among our own people, that is by raising a great deal\r\nmore than usual. To do this we must plant every bit of available\r\nland. (Of course, we can't; the owners won't let us. Ed.)\r\n\r\nIf you have a back yard, you can do your part and help the world and\r\nyourself by raising some of the food you eat. The more you raise the\r\nless you will have to buy, and the more there will be left for some\r\nof your fellow countrymen who have not an inch of ground on which to\r\nraise anything.\r\n\r\nIf there is a vacant lot in your neighborhood, see if you cannot get\r\nthe use of it for yourself and your neighbors, and raise your own\r\nvegetables. An hour a day spent in this way will not only increase\r\nwealth and help your family, but will help you personally by adding\r\nto your strength and well-being and making you appreciate the Eden\r\njoy of gardening. An hour in the open air is worth more than a dozen\r\nexpensive prescriptions by an expensive doctor.\r\n\r\nThe only tools necessary for a small garden are a spade or spading\r\nfork, a hoe, a rake, and a line or piece of cord.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, clear the ground of all rubbish, sticks, stones,\r\nbottles, etc. (especially whisky bottles).\r\n\r\nChoose the sunniest spot in the yard for your garden.\r\n\r\nDig up the soil to a depth of 6 to 10 inches, using a spade or\r\nspading fork. (Deeper for parsnips and some other roots. Ed.) Break\r\nup all the lumps with the spade or fork.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a section where your neighbors have gardens, you\r\nmight club together to hire a teamster for a day to do the plowing\r\nand harrowing for you all, thus saving a large amount of labor.\r\n\r\nAfter your garden has been well dug, it must be fertilized before\r\nany planting is done. In order to produce large and well-grown crops\r\nit is often necessary to fertilize before each planting. Very good\r\nprepared fertilizers can be bought at seed stores, but horse or cow\r\nmanure is much better, as it lightens the soil in addition to\r\nsupplying plant food. Use street sweepings if you can get them.\r\n\r\nThe manure should be well dug into the ground, at least to the full\r\ndepth of the top soil. The ground should then be thoroughly raked,\r\nas seeds must be sown in soil which has been finely powdered.\r\n\r\nLay out the garden, keeping the rows straight with a line. Straight\r\nrows are practically a necessity, not only for easier culture but\r\nfor economy in space.\r\n\r\nAfter you have marked all of your rows, the next step is opening the\r\nfurrow. (A furrow is a shallow trench.) That is done with the hoe.\r\n(Best and quickest with a wheel hoe. Ed.) After the furrow is\r\nopened, it is necessary that the seed be sown and immediately\r\ncovered before the soil has dried In covering the seeds the soil\r\nmust be firmly pressed down with the foot. This is important.\r\n\r\nIn buying seed it is best to go to some well-established seed house,\r\nor, if that can't be done, to order by mail rather than to take\r\nneedless chances. With most kinds of seeds a package is sufficient\r\nfor a twenty-foot row.\r\n\r\nBegin to break up the hard surface of the soil between the plants\r\nsoon after they appear, using a hand cultivator or hoe, and keep it\r\nloose throughout the season. This kills weeds; it lets in air to the\r\nplant roots and keeps the moisture in the ground.\r\n\r\nBy constantly stirring the top soil after your plants appear, the\r\nnecessity of watering can be largely avoided except in very dry\r\nweather. An occasional soaking of the soil is better than frequent\r\nsprinkling. Water your garden either very early in the morning or\r\nafter sundown. It is better not to water when the sun is shining\r\nhot.\r\n\r\nThe planting scheme can be altered to suit your individual taste.\r\nFor instance, peas and cabbage are included because almost everybody\r\nlikes to have them fresh from their garden; but they occupy more\r\nspace in proportion to their value than beets and carrots. Therefore\r\na small garden could be made more profitable by omitting them\r\naltogether, or cutting them down in amount and increasing the amount\r\nof carrots, beets, and turnips planted; or any of the vegetables\r\nmentioned which may not be in favor with the family can be left out.\r\n\r\nThe kind of season we have would change the date of planting. In\r\nraising vegetables, as in everything else, one should use one's\r\ncommon (or garden variety of) sense. A good rule is to wait until\r\nthe ground has warmed up a bit. Never try to work in soil wet enough\r\nto be sticky, or muddy; wait until it dries enough to crumble\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\nGardening is not a rule of thumb business. Each gardener must bring\r\nhis plants up in his own way in the light of his own experience and\r\nin accordance with the conditions of his own garden. A garden lover\r\nwho has a bit of land will speedily learn if his eyes and his mind,\r\nas well as his hands, are always busy, no matter how meager his\r\nknowledge at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of land--if you can only get it.\r\n\r\nSays Carl Vrooman, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, in regard to\r\nthe food problem:\r\n\r\n\"Millions of acres of farm land are being held out of use and other\r\nmillions of acres are being cultivated on a wasteful and inefficient\r\nbasis. Land values have risen at an unprecedented rate. They are\r\nbased not upon what the farm will earn at the present time, but on\r\nan expectancy of what it will be worth in the future. The farmer's\r\nson or the tenant farmer, with little or no capital, cannot hope to\r\nacquire possession of a farm w hen the price of land is SO high that\r\nhis earnings would not pay the interest on the investment. The\r\nresult is that land remains idle or in the hands of tenants, and\r\nthousands of farmers' boys desert the country for the city.\r\n\r\n\". . . . What we need, and need badly, is a program of taxation\r\nwhich, without throwing additional burdens on the bona fide farmer,\r\nwill place land now idle within the reach of men of limited means\r\nwho possess the ambition and the ability to cultivate it.\"\r\n\r\nYou can see that poor ignorant people, women, boys, cripples, old\r\nmen, often on less than 100 X 150 feet each, not only in\r\nPhiladelphia, but as war gardeners in New York, and most other\r\ntowns, have been able to support themselves by their work on the\r\nland. You can do much better.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, they had valuable land and often seeds free, but for\r\nsuch little pieces of land these are small items, and many of them\r\nhad no certainty of having the land even for a second year,\r\nconsequently they could not have hotbeds or any permanent\r\nimprovement. You can make all these things.\r\n\r\nThen what can you do? Only remember they had intelligent instruction\r\nand did the work themselves, and got the whole product; often the\r\nchildren helped--they thought it fun. It does not pay to farm a\r\nsmall piece of land where all the workers have to be hired. Nor does\r\nit pay if one calculates merely to stick in seeds with one hand and\r\npull out profits with the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nRESULTS TO BE EXPECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If we get every one out on the farms, then there will be an\r\nover-production of farm products and a fall in prices.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, but there are farmers who could do better in towns; what we\r\nwant to do is to make it easy for people to get on the land about\r\nthe cities, then it would be equally easy for those farmers who are\r\nbetter adapted for city life to get near the cities.\r\n\r\nUnder present conditions, where the worker is forced out fifteen or\r\ntwenty miles from the town by the high price of land and the large\r\namount of land required, the farmer is as much cut off from the city\r\nas the city dweller is cut off from rural life.\r\n\r\nWe need not be afraid to teach men better ways; there will always be\r\nplenty too stupid or too old or too isolated to learn; these will\r\nremain a bulwark against too sudden change.\r\n\r\nDr. Engel, former head of the Prussian Statistical Bureau, informs\r\nus that \"Scientific farming succeeds because a given amount of\r\neffort, when more intelligently directed, produces greater results.\r\nInasmuch, then, as the amount of food which the world can consume is\r\nlimited, the smaller will be the number of farmers required to\r\nproduce the needed supply, and the larger will be the number driven\r\nfrom the country to the city. It has already been observed that if\r\n34 scientific methods were universally adopted in the United States,\r\ndoubtless one half of those now engaged in agriculture could produce\r\nthe present crops, which would compel the other half to abandon the\r\nfarm.\" This is \"Engel's Law.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"argument\" assumes that we are now utilizing all the land\r\npossible and that every one is fully supplied with food. But when we\r\nconsider the great masses of people in the slums of all cities who\r\nare always underfed and whose constant thought is about their next\r\nmeal; when we see hundreds of able-bodied men waiting in line until\r\nmidnight for half a loaf of stale bread, surely it seems that there\r\nis a possibility of keeping all of the present farmers at work, if\r\nnot of finding new fields for others, if we make our conditions such\r\nthat there will be opportunities for every able-bodied worker to\r\nlabor at remunerative employment.\r\n\r\nProfessor L. H. Bailey, a most industrious and accurate observer,\r\nsays: \"Dr. Engel's argument rests on the assumption that\r\nagriculture produces only or chiefly food; but probably more than\r\nhalf of the agricultural products of the United States is not food.\r\nIt is cotton, flax, hemp, wool, hides, timber, tobacco, dyes, drugs,\r\nflowers, ornamental trees and plants, horses, pets, and fancy stock,\r\nand hundreds of other non-edible commodities. The total food produce\r\nof the United States, according to the twelfth census, was\r\n$1,837,000. The cost of material used in the three industries of\r\ntextile, lumber and leather manufactories alone was $1,851,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Engel thinks that the outlay for subsistence diminishes as\r\nincome increases; but comforts and luxuries increase in intimate\r\nratio with the income, and the larger part of these come from the\r\nfarm and forest. Dr. Engel, in fact, allows this, for he says that\r\n'sundries become greater as income increases.\"'\r\n\r\nWe have already abundance of information about almost every county\r\nin the Union, published by Boards of Trade and land boomers, like\r\nthe following about \"Oxnard, Ventura County, the center of the\r\nfamous lima bean district in California. For a year the returns from\r\nfarm products alone, in this vicinity, are estimated at over\r\n$2,000,000. The sugar factory, which uses 2000 tons of beets every\r\ntwenty-four hours, requires the yield of about 1900 acres every\r\nseason. The beet crop is rotated with beans, and the factory's\r\nsupply is kept good by systematic methods. Two thousand head of\r\ncattle are being fattened at the present time in the company's yard\r\non the beet pulp. Much of the pulp is also sold to local stockmen,\r\nwho value it highly for feed. The factory turns out 5000 bags of\r\nsugar every day.\" And again:\r\n\r\n\"Eastern farm lands steadily declined in price up to about 1902, so\r\nthat Eastern land sold for less than Western land of the same\r\nquality and of like situation; but the tide seems at last to have\r\nturned, and much money is now being made in buying up cheap farms\r\nand especially in sub-dividing them for small cultivators.\"\r\n\r\nThat sort of thing is interesting; but it is not what a man wants to\r\nknow--he is anxious to learn how much he can make and where and how\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nThe man who seeks a comfortable living will do better to rent on\r\nlong lease or buy a few acres convenient to trolley or railroad\r\ncommunication with a city; besides the returns which will come to\r\nthe farmer from the use of a few acres, if he is the owner he will\r\nget a constant increase in the value of the land, due to the growth\r\nof the city. If the city grows out so that the land becomes too\r\nvaluable to farm, he will be well paid for leaving.\r\n\r\n(Although progress is continually forcing laborers back upon less\r\ndesirable land, their loss, unless they are the owners, is the\r\nlandowner's gain.)\r\n\r\nThe amount of product to be grown for one's own use depends on the\r\nsize of the family and its fondness for vegetables.\r\n\r\n\"An area of 150X100 feet [about two fifths of an acre] is generally\r\nsufficient to supply a family of five persons with vegetables, not\r\nconsidering the winter supply of potatoes; but the acres must be\r\nwell tilled and handled.\" (Bailey, \"Principles of Vegetable\r\nGardening.\")\r\n\r\n\"The produce that could thus be obtained from an acre of land well\r\nsituated would abundantly supply with nearly all the vegetables\r\nnamed, nineteen families, comprising in all 114 individuals.\"\r\n\r\nIn our garden we must know what we want and know how to get it.\r\n\r\n(It is impossible to treat exhaustively of the various crops in a\r\nbook of this kind. On onion culture alone there are four standard\r\nbooks, besides seven or eight recent experimental station bulletins.\r\n\r\n\"In a family garden 100 X 150 feet (which equals six New York City\r\nlots), the rows running the long way of the area, eight or ten feet\r\nmay be reserved along one side for asparagus, rhubarb, sweet herbs,\r\nflowers, and possibly a few berry bushes. A strip twenty feet wide\r\nmay be reserved for vines, as melons, cucumbers and squashes. There\r\nremains a strip seventy feet wide, or space for twenty rows three\r\nand one half feat apart. This area is large enough to allow of\r\nappreciable results in rotation of crops; and i! it is judiciously\r\nmanaged, it should maintain high productiveness for a lifetime.\"\r\n(Bailey, \"Principles of Vegetable Gardening.\"))\r\n\r\n\"The things to be considered in the home garden are: (1) a\r\nsufficient product to supply the family; (2) continuous succession\r\nof crops; (3) ease and cheapness of cultivation; (4) maintenance of\r\nthe productivity of the land year after year.\r\n\r\n\"The ease and efficiency of cultivation are much enhanced if\r\nall crops are in long rows, to allow of wheel-tool tillage either by\r\nhorse or wheel-hoe.\"\r\n\r\nThe experience of the Vacant Lot Gardeners (Chapter IV) shows that\r\nif the land be near a large market where the product can be peddled\r\nor sold by the producers or by those (as in Mr. Rowe's case), with\r\nwhom he directly deals, more than twenty-five dollars capital is not\r\nnecessary, but Peter Henderson (\"Gardening for Profit\") estimates\r\nthat to get the best results, $300 capital per acre is required for\r\nanything less than ten acres.\r\n\r\nWhere the land is favorably situated a fortune may be made in\r\ncultivation of a few acres--with brains.\r\n\r\nQuinn says (\"Money in the Garden\") that he knows a large number of\r\nmarket gardeners worth from ten to forty thousand dollars each, none\r\nof whom had five hundred dollars to begin with.\r\n\r\nIf one has not enough money to get all that can be gotten out of his\r\nplot, it is best to put part of the land into clover to fit it for\r\nlater use or to use it for raising grass.\r\n\r\nResults undoubtedly come from hard work; but it is not necessary, in\r\norder to cultivate a little land successfully, that you should work\r\nall day on your hands and knees; if you can raise fruit or nuts,\r\nthis is not needed at all.\r\n\r\nBut for vegetables a certain amount of it is necessary--when there\r\nis a large job of that kind of weeding to be done, you can hire\r\nItalians or other foreigners to do it better and cheaper than you\r\ncan do it yourself. Those who will read this book can earn more with\r\ntheir heads than their hands; but when weeding is needed after a\r\nsudden shower and there is no one else, you must do some of it\r\nyourself; the weather will not wait for you to \"get a man,\" and if\r\nyou are not willing to do such things, your chances of success are\r\ngreatly lessened.\r\n\r\nHere is the experience of one who \"got a man\":\r\n\r\n\"My garden, to begin with, was in the most rudimentary condition,\r\nhaving been allowed to run to grass. After digging up a spot about\r\nten feet square in the turf, taking the early morning for the work,\r\nI decided that it would require all summer to get the garden fairly\r\nspaded up, so I hired a stalwart Irishman to do the work for me,\r\nwhich he did in a week, charging me nine dollars for the job. As he\r\nprofessed to be also an expert in planting vegetables, I bought a\r\nsupply of seeds in the city and intrusted them to him, assuring\r\nmyself that once in the ground the rest of the work would fall to\r\nme; if I could not keep a garden patch fifty feet square clear of\r\nweeds, I had better abandon the business at once, and all hopes of\r\nmaking a living out of scientific gardening. The beginning was an\r\nunfortunate one. The weather happened to be first very wet, and then\r\nso dry and hot that my vegetables were unable to break their way\r\nthrough the baked earth. When my peas and beans still gave no signs\r\nafter being in the ground for two weeks, I discovered that the whole\r\nwork would have to be done over again. A Presidential campaign was\r\nbeginning, which kept me in town often late at night, so that the\r\nchief labor of the garden fell to my faithful Irishman, who got far\r\nmore satisfaction out of it than I did. The vegetables finally did\r\ncome up above the surface, and many an evening I finished a hard\r\nday's work by pumping and carrying hundreds of gallons of water to\r\npour upon potato plants, tomatoes, beans, and other things which a\r\nfriend of mine, an expert in such matters, assured me were\r\ncuriosities of malformation and backwardness. My Irishman told me\r\nthat it was all for want of manure, and by his advice I bought six\r\ndollars' worth of manure from a neighboring stable, and had it\r\nspread over the ground. The bills for my garden were meanwhile\r\nmounting up. I had begun the spring with a garden ledger, keeping an\r\naccurate account of every penny spent, and hoping to put on the\r\nother side of the page a tremendous list of fine vegetables. The\r\naccounts are before me now, and I presume that every one who has\r\nbeen through the same experience has preserved some such record.\"\r\n(Naturally, if he began that way.) (\"Liberty and a Living,\" by P. G.\r\nHubert.)\r\n\r\nIf your idea of farming is to bury \"some seeds\" in untilled ground,\r\nregardless of suitability, and \"wait till they come up,\" you will\r\nwait in vain for a decent crop.\r\n\r\nSays Professor Roberts in the \"Farmstead\" (Macmillan), \"Mushrooms\r\nsell at fifty cents per pound; maize for one half cent per pound.\r\nWhy? Because anybody, even a squaw, can raise maize, but only a\r\nspecially skilled gardener can succeed in mushroom culture.\"\r\n\r\nBut enough has been said to show that you must cultivate with\r\nbrains. The Germans say, \"What your head won't do, your legs have\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n  \"We'll have a little farm,\r\n  A pig, a horse and cow\r\n  And you will drive the wagon\r\n  While I drive the plow,\"\r\n\r\nis very pretty. The horse and the pigs are practical, if you can\r\ntake care of them yourself; pigs are good farm catch-alls. If you\r\nhave to pay a man to do it, you had better hire your horses and buy\r\nyour pork.\r\n\r\nTwo well-groomed, healthy cows, one calving in the spring and one in\r\nthe autumn, can be made a source of profit, and of valuable manure,\r\nif you have land enough in a neighborhood where up-to-date parents\r\nare willing to pay ten to twenty cents a quart for pure milk for\r\ntheir infants or even for family use. But your land and your own\r\nbaby's care and milk will probably be enough for you to attend to\r\npromptly and thoroughly every day--and night.\r\n\r\nIt is an age-old experience that if we take care of a little land,\r\nthe land will take care of us. In Ferrero's \"Grandezza e Decadenza\r\ndi Roma\" is an interesting account of Marcus Terentius Varro's \"De\r\nRe Rustica.\" Varro wrote in the year 37 B.C., and as he was then\r\neighty years old, he had seen the transformation of Italy from an\r\nagricultural to a manufacturing, trading community and the\r\naccompanying wreck of the old agricultural system, which, of course,\r\nhe laments.\r\n\r\nThe growth of vast landed estates largely held by imperial\r\nfavorites, as Pliny said, destroyed Italy. So fearful has the\r\ndestruction been that it is only in our generation that the Campagna\r\nat Rome, which was once an intensely fruitful quilt of garden\r\npatches, has been reclaimed from the fever-smitten swamp to which\r\nvast landlordism had reduced it.\r\n\r\nIn the third book of \"De Re Rustica,\" Varro recommends as his\r\nremedy, intensive cultivation close to the cities, and the breeding\r\nof \"fancy stock,\" including pigeons' snails, peacocks, deer, and\r\nwild boars.\r\n\r\nHe tells how an aunt of his made 60,000 sesterces ($3000) in one\r\nyear by raising thrushes for the Roman market, at a time when an\r\nexcellent farm of about 200 acres only yielded 30,000 sesterces per\r\nannum. He quotes another case of one who made 40,000 sesterces per\r\nannum from a flock of one hundred peacocks, by selling the eggs and\r\nthe young. Those old Roman women weren't so slow.\r\n\r\nFerraro calls Varro's work one of the most important for the history\r\nof ancient Italy and says historians have made a mistake in not\r\nreading it.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the migration of the barbarians (350 to 750 A.D.),\r\nthe lot of each able-bodied man was about thirty morgen (equal to\r\ntwenty acres) on average lands, on very good ground only ten to\r\nfifteen morgen (equal to seven or ten acres), four morgen being\r\nequal to one hectare. Of this land, at least a third, and sometimes\r\na half, was left uncultivated each year. The remainder of the\r\nfifteen to twenty morgen sufficed to feed and fatten into giants the\r\nimmense families of these child-producing Germans, and this in spite\r\nof the primitive technique, whereby at least half the productive\r\ncapacity of a day was lost. (From \"The State,\" by Franz\r\nOppenheimer, p. 11.)\r\n\r\nIn the Orange Judd prize contest, merely for the clearest account of\r\na garden, not for results at all, a number of the contestants raised\r\nproduce at the rate of $150 to $400 per acre and over, even in\r\nsemi-arid regions; for instance, L. E. Burnham says that he raised\r\non his first garden of about one third of an acre in eastern\r\nMassachusetts, garden stuff which he sold to summer cottagers for\r\n$61.69.\r\n\r\nThis took about eight days' work, nearly all with a wheel hoe.\r\n\r\nRemember about the present increased and changing prices and costs?\r\nAt the present writing, 1917, the advances in costs and prices would\r\nprobably average about three quarters, and those of common labor\r\nperhaps one third over those given in the text. In other respects,\r\nthe instances and authorities, still pertinent, have been retained\r\nin this revision.\r\n\r\nIt would have been waste, not thrift, to get a new authority to tell\r\nus that straw makes the cleanest mulch for strawberries; that's the\r\nreason they were called strawberries; and they grew just the same\r\nway ten years ago.\r\n\r\nL. E. Dimosh of Connecticut raised on one quarter of an acre\r\n$146.21, of which over $85 was profit.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the profits were $142 (Gianque, Nebraska) per acre;\r\nand over $295 (Dora Dietrich, Pennsylvania); with the rather\r\nexceptional profit at the rate of $570 (Mrs. Hall, Connecticut).\r\nSome showed a loss.\r\n\r\nSome of the town or city lots yielded very high profits; one of a\r\nthird of an acre gave a profit of $224.33 (Edge Darlington, Md.).\r\n\r\nThe summary \"based upon the reports of five hundred and fifteen\r\ngardens in nearly every state and territory and in Canada and the\r\nprovinces, may be considered accurate and reliable. Covering such a\r\nvast territory local conditions are avoided.\" It shows that \"the\r\naverage size of farm gardens was 24,372 square feet, or about half\r\nan acre, the average labor cost $26.34, the average value of product\r\nwas at the rate of $170 per acre, and the net profit over $80 per\r\nacre.\"\r\n\r\nTo get results we must first learn and then teach what we know. The\r\nfinest game in the world is to teach. No one ever knows anything\r\nthoroughly till he tries to teach it.\r\n\r\nWhen you tell a person how to do a thing, he doesn't know how to do\r\nit himself. When you show him how to do it, still he doesn't know\r\nthat he could do it himself. But when you get him to do it himself,\r\nthen he knows.\r\n\r\nCountry boys will believe that early tomatoes can be raised by\r\nstarting them in the house; but like the rest of us they don't know\r\nhow to do it, and when spring comes and it is time to do such\r\nthings, they are busy on the farm. There are several schools trying\r\nthe experience of allowing the children to plant in window boxes in\r\nearly April and are showing them how to do it. But as there is not\r\nroom for all the children to plant in these window boxes, there is a\r\nnew idea which originated in the country, where the children are\r\nengaged in the fall and the spring assisting their parents at\r\nagricultural work.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to get up any interest in school gardens, but it was all\r\nthe more important that they should have agricultural instruction in\r\nthe winter time.\r\n\r\nAt Berkeley Heights, N. J., we devised this simple plan, and it\r\nworks. We made a number of wooden boxes, one foot wide, two feet\r\nlong, so they will just fit on the ledge of a school desk. They are\r\nonly three inches deep, with a bottom of tin, turned up at the\r\nedges, or of well painted pine, white-leaded at the joints. There is\r\nno drainage, since we discovered that if they are not watered too\r\nmuch, they do better without drainage. The holes usually made in the\r\nbottoms of flower boxes carry off a lot of plant food with the water\r\nthat runs through.\r\n\r\nNow, how to store these boxes when they are not in the sunny places\r\nnear the windows? Why, we set up four posts of one-inch stuff at the\r\nfour corners, so that the box looks like a kitchen table turned\r\nupside down (see illustration). Now the boxes filled with earth and\r\nwith the young plants growing can be stored at night, one on top of\r\nthe other, by the wall of the schoolroom.\r\n\r\nIf it is going to be cold, and over Sundays, the pile of them can be\r\ncovered with newspapers, which keep them from getting chilled and\r\nfrom drying up, or the boxes can be covered and carried home by the\r\nchildren. We found that for most plants nine inches is high enough\r\nfor the posts, and that well-seasoned one-inch lumber is heavy\r\nenough not to warp if it is painted inside and out, and it is not\r\ntoo heavy to lift.\r\n\r\nBy the way, better paint the joints before the sides are nailed\r\ntogether. It makes them more water-tight. Four screws at the corners\r\nwill make them still tighter.\r\n\r\nThe scholars raise lettuce, parsley, onions, and strawberries, and\r\nall kinds of small plants, as well as flowers, in the winter; and\r\nwhen the plants get too big or two crowded for the boxes, they are\r\nseparated and transplanted into other boxes to be taken home.\r\n\r\nThis was so successful that we devised a big window box which is\r\nsuited for home use also; it is just as wide as the window and half\r\nas long again as it is wide. But this box does not stand outside on\r\nthe window sill; if it did, the plants would freeze. One end only\r\nrests on the inside window sill where it gets the sun; the end is\r\nsupported by two legs of the same height that the window sill is\r\nfrom the floor.\r\n\r\nWhen a nice warm day comes, the other end of the box is pushed out\r\nof the window and the sash closed down on it to keep it from falling\r\nout. A couple of cleats or nails in the window jamb help to hold it\r\nin place.\r\n\r\nOf course, the box has to be watched and taken in if it turns cold,\r\nbut it's astonishing how much can be raised and how much more can be\r\nlearned out of season by the school desk boxes and the home window\r\nsliding boxes.\r\n\r\nTry it and see for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe children can learn as much about some things from a box 2X1 ft.\r\nas they can from a children's garden. Here are a couple of samples\r\nof what the kids themselves in a city school think of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\r\n\r\n_\"Office of the Principal of Public School No. 7_\r\n\r\n\"VAN ALST AVE., ASTORIA, QUEENS\r\n\r\n\"I inclose a few compositions that were written by some of our boys\r\nand girls of the Fourth Year.

No. 7\r\n\r\nGrade 4 A--April 2l, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Miller, Age 10\r\n\r\nOUR GARDEN\r\n\r\nAt first we planted radishes then onions and lettuce and beans and\r\nsunflowers. Each one of us have 1/4 of a box. When we had finished\r\nthat we brought them up to the front of the room and then watered\r\nthem and went home.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Duerr, Age 8\r\n\r\nMY GARDEN\r\n\r\nI have a garden. It is a box. I have a quarter of a box for my very\r\nown. My garden has five rows. In the first there are radishes, in\r\nthe second lettuce, in the third onions, in the fourth beans, in the\r\nfifth sunflowers. I hope my garden grows up.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course these are only preparatory for profitable work. We have\r\ncases in which $2000 has been recorded from sales in one year from\r\none acre, and many cases in which at least $1000 worth of produce\r\nhas been sold from an acre. These are sales, not profits.\r\n\r\nSuch results are not due to the boundless and fertile soil of the\r\nnew world nor to small farming alone--they are due to intelligence.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ronna gives the following figures of crops per acre at\r\nRomford (Breton's Farm): 28 tons of potatoes (say 952 bushels), 16\r\ntons of marigold, 105 tons of beets, 110 tons of carrots, 9 to 20\r\ntons of various cabbages, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to the Agricultural Department that it might fix\r\nstandards of what is a good attainable crop.\r\n\r\nOn every golf links we have what is called a Bogie score posted up.\r\nThat is a score that a certain mythical Captain Bogie, supposed to\r\nbe an average good player, could make on those links. On one typical\r\nclub-course, for instance, the Bogie score is 42. Though it has been\r\ndone in 37, the ordinary player congratulates himself when he gets\r\ndown to the Bogie score.\r\n\r\nNow, if there were standards attainable to ordinary intelligent and\r\ngood cultivation set in each section, it would enormously encourage\r\nfarmers to reach them, which may be of great importance.\r\n\r\nOne of the heads of the Department replied as follows:\r\n\r\n'\"In regard to fixing a standard for each farmer to strive to\r\nattain, I think that a very good idea; but the standard for each\r\ncrop in each particular locality would necessarily be somewhat\r\ndifferent from that in every other locality. Persons who have had\r\nexperience in experimental work keenly appreciate these points. The\r\nwork which is done upon one soil formation under different climatic\r\nconditions in one season, does not necessarily find a duplicate in\r\nany other locality, and the experience is that what is accomplished\r\nin one year would not be duplicated on the same soil and under the\r\nsame management again in several years, for the conditions under\r\nwhich agriculture is carried on are so many of them outside of the\r\ncontrol of the operator that it is very difficult to predict results\r\nor to attain any fixed standard. This is necessarily so with an\r\noperation which has so many uncertain factors to deal with as\r\nagriculture. Humidity of the atmosphere and of the soil, the\r\navailable plant food in the soil, methods of tillage, fertilizers\r\nused, recurrence of frosts, amount of sunlight, the altitude and\r\nlatitude of different localities, all have a bearing upon crop\r\nproduction. It is, therefore, very difficult to fix any approximate\r\nstandard or average production for any particular locality without\r\nbasing it upon a long series of years. I think, however, that it is\r\na subject worthy of agitation, and it might inspire agriculturists\r\nto better work were such an ideal fixed upon.\"\r\n\r\nThis indicates that each experiment station or progressive farmer or\r\nteacher of agriculture might advantageously establish the local\r\n\"Bogie score\" of what might fairly be expected.\r\n\r\nWe know how misleading averages are. The man who tried to wade\r\nacross a stream whose average depth was two feet, was drowned. \"The\r\nwriter used to go to a fishing club of which Cornelius Vanderbilt\r\nwas a member. One of the standard jokes there was that the thirty\r\nmembers are worth on an average over two million apiece, that is,\r\nCornelius sixty millions, and the rest of us (comparatively)\r\nnothing. Which are you to be? A Vanderbilt among cultivators, or\r\nthe other fellow who makes the 'average'?\" (\"Money Making in Free\r\nAmerica,\" by the Author.)\r\n\r\nBut even making all allowances we see that we must cultivate much\r\nbetter than the \"average,\" to make anything more than the farmer's\r\nhard living off the land. Peter Dunne tells us what kind of a grind\r\nthat is.\r\n\r\n\"This pa-aper says th' farmer niver sthrikes. He hasn't got th' time\r\nto. He's too happy. A farmer is continted with his farm lot. There's\r\nnawthin' to take his mind off his wurruk. He sleeps at night with\r\nhis nose against th' shingled roof iv his little frame home an'\r\ndhreams iv cinch bugs.

You must figure out for\r\nyourself what you can make your acres produce and what the product\r\ncan be sold for.\r\n\r\nAll progress in agriculture has come heretofore through experiments,\r\nmade mostly by uninformed and untrained men. What may not be done by\r\npractical learning and applied intelligence?\r\n\r\nThe wonderful recent advances have been made in just that way.\r\n\r\n\"The modern improved methods in agriculture, known collectively as\r\nintensive farming, have nearly all had their origin in the hands of\r\ntruck farmers and market gardeners. No class of the rural population\r\nis more alert in utilizing the newest researches and discoveries in\r\nall lines of agricultural science, and none keeps in closer touch\r\nwith the agricultural colleges and experiment stations.\"\r\n(\"Development of the Trucking Interests,\" by F. S. Earle.)\r\n\r\nStill, it is not advisable for the ordinary city dweller, however\r\nintelligent, without other means and without either experience or\r\nstudy, to cast himself upon a small patch of ground for a living;\r\nbut if he can give it most of his time mornings and evenings, or if\r\nhe sees, as many do, that he will be forced out of a position, it\r\nwould be well for him seriously to consider intensive cultivation as\r\na resource.\r\n\r\nIt would be the greatest blessing to our day laborers if they could\r\nsecure an acre of land which they could till in conjunction with\r\ntheir other labor. If time and change 90 works upon society as to\r\nput the laborer out of a job, he will be safe in his acre home and\r\ncan live from it and be happy and contented.\r\n\r\nThe time required to cultivate an acre is much less than is\r\ngenerally supposed.\r\n\r\nThe maximum time required seems to be that given in the University\r\nof Illinois Experiment Station at Urbana, Bulletin 61, by J. W.\r\nLloyd, at the rate of 140 hours (say 14 days) with one horse and 250\r\nhours (say 25 days) for hand labor. With a great variety of crops,\r\nor with poor labor add one half to this time allowance. The results\r\nvary greatly.\r\n\r\nAn acre of northeastern Long Island will produce 250 to 400 bushels\r\nof potatoes at a selling price of fifty to seventy five cents per\r\nbushel, which wholesale, at those figures much below present prices,\r\nbring an income of $125 to $300 to the grower. The actual cash\r\noutlay in one instance was:\r\n\r\n  Seed Potatoes                           $10.00\r\n  Commercial Fertilizer                    13.00\r\n  Spraying for blight and pests             4.00\r\n\r\n  TOTAL                                   $27.00\r\n\r\n  250 bu. selling at the minimum price   $125.00\r\n\r\n  Less the cash outlay                     27.00\r\n\r\n  Income to the grower from an acre       $98.00\r\n\r\n\r\nA production of 400 bushels costs no more cash outlay per acre,\r\nwhile the income is big wages to the farmer.\r\n\r\nIf but one acre be grown and hand labor is used, the labor might\r\ncost an average of $40 per acre, with wages at $1.35 to $1.50 per\r\nday, and if the produce is shipped any distance by rail and\r\nconsigned, it would cost $40 to $50 to pay selling charges, leaving\r\nyou a profit of about $30 per acre on this crop. Other crops in the\r\nrotation might not be so profitable, hence it is not fair to figure\r\nan income on one. But, of course, in the above estimate, we are\r\nconsidering mainly the cases where the gardener does the work and\r\nearns the wages himself.\r\n\r\nAn acre will bear if devoted to each crop, of:\r\n\r\n  Blackberries, 10,000 qt., which at 7 cent a qt., would bring $700.00\r\n  Dewberries, 9,000 qt., say at 7 cent a qt. 630.00\r\n  Gooseberries, 250 bu. at $2.00 a bu. 500.00\r\n  Strawberries, 8,000 qt. at 5 cent a qt. 400.00\r\n  Currants, 3000 plants yield 6000 bu. 200.00\r\n  Raspberries, per acre 200.00 to 600.00\r\n  Peaches, per acre 200.00 to 400.00\r\n  Pears, per acre 200.00 to 500.00\r\n  Apples, per acre 100.00 to 500.00\r\n  Grapes 100.00\r\n\r\nFive, or even three acres will give a good living if this can be\r\napproximated:\r\n\r\nAn acre will produce in vegetables--either\r\n\r\n  Asparagus, 3000 bunches at 20 cent a bunch, would be $600.00\r\n  Cauliflower, 100 to 300 bbl. at $1.50, say 450.00\r\n  Onions, 600 bu. at 75 cent per bu. 450.00\r\n  Cabbage Seed, 1000 lb., at 40 cent a lb. 400.00\r\n  Brussels sprouts, 3000 qt. at 10 cent a qt. 300.00\r\n  Celery, 600 bunches at 5 cent a bunch 300.00\r\n  Parsnips, 300 bu. at 1.00 a bu. 300.00\r\n  Lettuce, 9000 heads at 3 cent a head 270.00\r\n  Lima Beans, 50 bu. at $5.00 a bu. 250.00\r\n\r\nWe may hope to get from an acre, respectively in\r\n\r\n  Potatoes, 300 bu. at 75 cent a bu, would be $225.00\r\n  Cabbages, 20 tons at $10.00 a ton 200.00\r\n  Carrots and Beets, 200 to 400 bu 150.00\r\n  Tomatoes, 200 crates at 75 cent a crate 150.00\r\n  Early Peas, 50 bu. at $2000 a bu. 100.00\r\n  Turnips, 400 bu. at 25 cent a bu 100.00\r\n  Spinach, 100 bbl. at 50 cent a bbl. 50.00\r\n\r\nMr. D. L. Hartman, whose experience in the North is given on a later\r\npage, has since moved to Little River, Florida. He writes in 1917:\r\n\r\n\"I have recently sold the last strawberries of a small plot. Owing\r\nto a combination of circumstances it produced, I think, the largest\r\nvalue per area of any crop I have ever cultivated. The main factors\r\nwere high prices realized and heavy yield.\r\n\r\nArea of plot, a trifle over one fifth acre. Total yield, 2295\r\nquarts, total receipts, $ 4703.80.\r\n\r\nFirst berries picked January 2nd; last berries picked June 26th;\r\nVariety, Brandywine.\r\n\r\n\"This shows a yield of 11,107 quarts per acre worth at the same\r\nrate, $3398.00.\r\n\r\n\"The fruit was all sold to stores in Miami (five miles distant) and\r\nbrought an average you notice of 30-2/3 cents per quart for the\r\ncrop, the highest bringing fifty cents per quart. The average price\r\nduring the ordinary seasons is about twenty cents per quart. My\r\nordinary average yield is less than half of this yield or about 5000\r\nquarts per acre, and that is much above the average of most yields\r\nof other growers. The crop was started with northern plants, set\r\njust as for matted rows in the North, then early in November plants\r\nwere dug up and set out in order in rows 12 inches apart and 8-1/2\r\ninches apart in the row, leaving every fifth row vacant for paths.\r\nIt is super close culture; one plant per square foot for the total\r\narea or a little more.\r\n\r\n\"I often think that if I were operating in the North again I would\r\nlike to try strawberries the same way, except that I would do the\r\ntransplanting September 1st instead of November 1st as here, since I\r\nwould expect them to grow larger and of course I would plan to mulch\r\nthem during the winter. It would take a lot of planting but I think\r\nit would insure a tremendous yield. I find that the digging and\r\nplanting including watering of 1500 plants makes ten hours' work\r\nwith elimination of all waste motion.\"\r\n\r\nYou will not get as good results as Mr. Hartman's average, unless\r\nyou learn as much as he has learned; he has succeeded by\r\nwell-directed work in different places and circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe South and West are not the only places in the United States\r\nwhere a man can live on one acre of ground, by intensive culture and\r\nwith irrigation. The Eastern and Middle States can present just as\r\ngood, if not better, opportunities, especially where land in small\r\ntracts is available near the large cities.\r\n\r\n_The Farmers' Advocate_ (Topeka, Kansas) says of lands which ten\r\nyears ago were among the much advertised \"abandoned farms\" of the\r\neastern states: \"All over the eastern states where farming twenty\r\nyears ago was pronounced a failure under Western competition there\r\nhas sprung up this intensive cultivation. Violets are grown in one\r\nplace and tuberoses by the acre in another. Celery is making one\r\nman's large profit near Williamsburg. Special fruits are cultivated.\r\nCurrants are grown by the ton and sold by the pound, yielding a\r\nprofit. This is in progress over the entire range of farming.\"\r\n\r\nAt Hyde Park, a little village three miles north of Reading, Pa.,\r\nthere is a small farm owned by Oliver R. Shearer, who may be said to\r\nbe one of the most successful farmers in the United States. This\r\nfarm contains 3-1/2 acres, only 2-1/2 of which are cultivated, but\r\nthey yield the owner annually from $1200 to $1500. From the profits\r\nof his intensive farming, Mr. Shearer has paid $3800 for his\r\nproperty, which, besides the land, consists of a modern two-story\r\nbrick house, with barn, chicken-yard, and orchard, the whole\r\nsurrounded by a neat fence. He has also raised and educated a family\r\nof three children.\r\n\r\nThere are no secrets, Mr. Shearer says, about his method of farming.\r\nA study of conditions, the application of common-sense methods and\r\nuntiring energy, he asserts, will enable others to do what he has\r\ndone, but that most men would kill themselves with the work.\r\n\r\nIn an agricultural exchange a small farmer tells that he makes a\r\nliving and saves some money from a ten-acre farm. Before he was\r\nthrough paying for his land, which cost $100 an acre, building his\r\nhouse, fences, and outbuildings, he went in debt $1300, having about\r\nthe same amount to start with. He is near a good market, and in five\r\nyears has paid off the debt, and has been getting ahead ever since.\r\nHe raises poultry and small fruits, and says that it is a good\r\ncombination, as most of the work with poultry comes in winter, while\r\nhe can do nothing out of doors. He maintains that a ten-acre farm\r\nrightly managed will bring a good living, including the comforts and\r\nsome of the luxuries of life, and says: \"This I have fully\r\ndemonstrated, and what I have done others may do.\"\r\n\r\n_Maxwell's Talisman_ says:\r\n\r\n\"E. J. O'Brien of Citronelle, Alabama, received $170 clear from an\r\nacre of cucumbers shipped to the St. Louis market. He was two weeks\r\nlate in getting them on the market. He says those two weeks would\r\nhave meant nearly double the net returns. He does not consider this\r\nan extraordinary return and hopes to do better next year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor Thomas Shaw writes of a plot of ordinary ground in\r\nMinnesota comprising the nineteenth part of an acre, which for years\r\nkept a family of six matured persons abundantly supplied with\r\nvegetables all the year, with the exception of potatoes, celery, and\r\ncabbage. In addition, much was given away, more especially of the\r\nearly varieties, and in many instances much was thrown away.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the market-gardens of Florida we see such crops as 445 to 600\r\nbushels of onions per acre, 400 bushels of tomatoes, 700 bushels of\r\nsweet potatoes; which testify to a high development of culture.\"\r\n\r\nWe select from Bailey's \"Principles of Vegetable Gardening\" the\r\nfollowing general estimates:\r\n\r\n_Beets--_Average crop is 300-400 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n_Carrots--_Good crop is 200-300 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n_Cabbage--_8000 heads per acre.\r\n\r\n_Potatoes--_The yield of potatoes averages about 75 bushels per\r\nacre, but with forethought and good tillage and some fertilizer the\r\nyield should run from 200 to 300 bushels, and occasionally yields\r\nwill much exceed the latter figure.\r\n\r\n_Rhubarb--_From 2 to 5 stalks are tied in a bunch for market, and an\r\nacre should produce 3000 dozen bunches.\r\n\r\n_Salsify--_Good crop 200-300 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n_Onions--_A good crop of onions is 300-400 bushels to the acre, but\r\n600-800 are secured under the very best conditions.\r\n\r\nThe price per ton for horseradish varies from ten to fifty dollars,\r\nand from two to four tons should be raised on an acre, the latter\r\nquantity when the ground is deep and rich and when the plants do not\r\nsuffer for moisture.\r\n\r\nAverages are very misleading and it would be better to pay little\r\nattention to them. They are like the average wealth possessed by a\r\nclass of twenty schoolchildren. The schoolmaster who had $20 asked\r\nwhat was the average wealth of each, if the total wealth of the\r\nclass was $20. The brightest boy answered, \"One dollar.\" The\r\nschoolmaster asked Tommy at the foot of the class if he did not\r\nthink they would be a prosperous class. He answered, \"It depends on\r\nwho has the 'twenty.'\"\r\n\r\nBut, all the more, good averages imply some wonderful yields. The\r\nfollowing are actual averages in the United States Twelfth and\r\nThirteenth Census Report, respectively.\r\n\r\nFlowers and plants, $2014 and $1911; nursery products, $170 and\r\n$261; sugar cane, $87 (4 tons per acre) and $5540; small fruits, $81\r\nand $110; hops, $72 (885 lb. per acre) and $175; sweet potatoes, $37\r\n(79 but per acre) and $55; hemp, $34 (794 lb. per acre) and $54;\r\npotatoes, $33 (96 bu. per acre) and $45; sugar beets, $30 (7 tons\r\nper acre) and $54; sorghum cane, $21 (1 ton per acre) and $23;\r\ncotton, $15 (4-10 bale per acre) and $25.70 flaxseed, $9 (9 bu. per\r\nacre) and $14; cereals, $8 and $11.40.\r\n\r\nSpecialties, however, often do much better. For example, R. B.\r\nHandy, in Farmers' Bulletin No. 60, United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, tells us that a prominent and successful New Jersey\r\ngrower says:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot give the cost in detail of establishing asparagus beds, as\r\nso much would depend upon whether one had to buy the roots, and upon\r\nother matters. Where growers usually grow roots for their own\r\nplanting the cost is principally the labor, manure, and the use of\r\nland for two years upon which, however, a half crop can be had.\r\n\r\n\"The cost of maintaining a bed can only be estimated per acre as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Manure (applied in the spring) $25.00\r\n  Labor, plowing, cultivating, hoeing, etc 20.00\r\n  Cutting and bunching 40.00\r\n  Fertilizer (applied after cutting) 15.00\r\n\r\n  Total $100.00\r\n\r\n\"An asparagus bed well established, say five years after planting,\r\nwhen well cared for should, for the next ten or fifteen years, yield\r\nfrom 1800 to 2000 bunches per annum, or at 10 cents per bunch\r\n(factory price) $180 to $200.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the rent, labor, etc., for a crop of asparagus is $200 per acre,\r\nand the crop is three tons of green shoots at $100 per ton, on the\r\nfarm, the profit is $100 per acre. If we get six tons at $100 per\r\nton, the profit, less the extra cost of labor and manure, is $400\r\nper acre.\" (\"Food for Plants,\" by Harris and Myers, page 19.)\r\n\r\nAround Bethlehem, Indiana, the farmers raise hundreds of tons of\r\nsunflower seed every year, and the industry pays better than\r\nanything else in the farming line. A good deal of the seed is made\r\ninto condition powder for stock, occasionally some is made into\r\nso-called \"olive oil\" which is said to surpass cotton-seed oil.\r\nLarge quantities are used for feeding parrots and poultry, or\r\nconsumed by the Russian Hebrews who eat them as we would eat\r\npeanuts.\r\n\r\nA careful investigation made in 1898 of the value of certain\r\nproductions taken from farms in New York State shows that the\r\nculture of apples is very profitable. From twenty adjoining farms in\r\none neighborhood in western New York, the report gave an average\r\nannual return of $85 per acre at the orchard, covering a period of\r\nfive years. Another report gave an average of $110 annual income per\r\nacre for three years, and these results were obtained where only\r\nordinary care was given to the orchard. But note this.--\r\n\r\nOne orchard, where the trees had been well sprayed to protect the\r\nfruit from insect injuries, and the soil well cultivated and\r\nproperly fertilized, gave a return in one year of $700 per acre, and\r\nfor three years an average income of $400 per acre.\r\n\r\nOne man bought a farm of 100 acres in Central New York with a\r\nmuch-neglected orchard upon it of 30 acres, paying $5000 for the\r\nwhole. He cultivated the orchard, pruned and sprayed the trees\r\nthoroughly, and in seven months from the time he purchased the farm,\r\nsold the apple crop from it for $6000 cash.\r\n\r\n\"Peanuts: Culture and Uses,\" by R. B. Handy in Farmers' Bulletin No.\r\n25 of the United States Department of Agriculture says:\r\n\r\n\"According to the Census the average yield of peanuts in the United\r\nStates was 17.6 bushels per acre, the average in Virginia being\r\nabout 20, and in Tennessee 32 bushels per acre. This appears to be a\r\nlow average, especially as official and semiofficial figures give 50\r\nto 60 bushels as an average crop, and 100 bushels is not an uncommon\r\nyield. Fair peanut land properly manured and treated to intelligent\r\nrotation of crops should produce in an ordinary season a yield of 50\r\nbushels to the acre and from 1 to 2 tons of excellent hay. (Of\r\ncourse better land with more liberal treatment and a favorable\r\nseason will produce heavier crops, the reverse being true of lands\r\nwhich have been frequently planted with peanuts without either\r\nmanuring or rotation of crops.) Besides the amount of peanuts\r\ngathered, there are always large quantities left in the ground which\r\nhave escaped the gathering, and on these the planter turns his herd\r\nof hogs, so that there is no waste of any part of the plant.\"\r\n\r\nTobacco is a paying crop if the soil is just right. Two thousand\r\npounds per acre can be raised on favorable sites. Connecticut\r\ntobacco brings, in ordinary times, from twenty to thirty cents a\r\npound; from four to over six hundred dollars being the possible\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nSome Connecticut soils raise Sumatra tobacco equal to the imported\r\ncrop that sells in this country at fancy prices. The Department of\r\nAgriculture claims that the Cuban type of tobacco can be closely\r\napproximated in Pennsylvania and Ohio. But it must be remembered\r\nthat the soil is of paramount importance in tobacco raising. The\r\nDepartment has prepared soil maps of most of the important tobacco\r\ndistricts of the United States. If you think your land may be suited\r\nto tobacco, apply there for information. You may make your land\r\ninvaluable.\r\n\r\nD. L. Hartman, _Rural New Yorker,_ gave the following facts and\r\nfigures: \"During last season the sales from one acre of early\r\ntomatoes amounted to $454, and from a trifle more than two and one\r\nhalf acres, including the acre of 'earlies,' the remainder\r\nmid-season and late plantings, the total sales amounted to over\r\n$900. From a little less than one acre and a half $555 worth of\r\nstrawberries were sold, while the returns from early cabbages during\r\nthe last few years have been at the rate of about $300 per acre.\r\nThese statements are not made in the spirit of challenge. The\r\nresults are gratifying to me, because larger than anticipated; but\r\nmuch greater values can be and are produced. In fact, the limit of\r\nvalue that may be grown on an acre of land no one can tell. I have a\r\nsmall plot of ground containing less than one sixth of an acre,\r\nplanted one year with radishes and lettuce, followed by eggplant and\r\ncauliflower, and the next year to radishes alone, followed by\r\negg-plant, and each year the total sales amounted to over $200, at\r\nthe rate of $1200 per acre. Greatly exceeding even this was a\r\nsmaller plot, measuring 20 X 65 feet, last year, planted first to\r\npansies, plants sold when in bloom, followed by radishes, of which\r\none half proved to be a worthless variety (it lay idle long enough\r\nto have produced another crop of radishes), then half was planted to\r\nlate lettuce, the other half being sown for winter cabbage, plants\r\nyielding no cash return. Yet the total sales for the season from\r\nthis small plot, less than one thirty-second of an acre, was $86.78\r\nat the rate of the surprising sum of $2780 per acre, and could\r\neasily have been raised to the rate of $4,000, and that without the\r\nuse of any glass whatever, Truly the possibilities of the soil are\r\nunknown.\"\r\n\r\nThe cooperative features used by Northeastern Long Island intensive\r\nfarmers are worthy of imitation. In the community of Riverhead a\r\nclub buys at wholesale rates commodities which the farm and\r\nhousehold require. The club does a large business, and has a high\r\nrating in the commercial agencies. In another instance at Riverhead\r\nan association markets the crop of cauliflower, sending cars of such\r\nproduce to Cincinnati and Chicago. These are the best forms of\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\n\"In the market-gardening sections the banks show prosperity. In the\r\ntowns of Riverhead and Southold there are savings banks with\r\ndeposits of $4,000,000 each, and five business banks which are doing\r\na thriving business. In this stretch of thirty miles on eastern Long\r\nIsland the farms are mostly free from encumbrance of any kind.\r\n\r\n\"It should be noted, however, that their towns have the open Sound\r\nwith its bays which furnish open ways for transportation and an\r\nunowned field for work.\" (From circular of the Long Island Guild of\r\nNew York City.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSOME METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not put all our time into one crop unless we are rich enough\r\nto do our own insurance; for drought, or damp; or accident,\r\nill-adapted seed, or general unfavorable conditions may make\r\nfailures of one or more crops. But in variety and succession of\r\ncrops is safety and profit. In order to succeed, crop must be made\r\nto follow crop, so that the ground is used to its full capacity. To\r\nleave it fallow for even a week is to invite weeds and to lose much\r\nof the advantage of tillage, as well as so much time.\r\n\r\nIn the North, seeds of many kinds should be sown from the first of\r\nMarch to the first of August; in the South they should be sown in\r\nevery month.\r\n\r\nBy following the simple time tables for planting you will find work\r\nready and crops maturing and ready for sale in every month in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThere is an admirable table of the time to plant, given in \"How to\r\nMake a Vegetable Garden,\" though it does embrace some weird\r\nvegetables, explaining, for instance, that pats-choi is used like\r\nchards, and that \"Scolymus is sowed like Scorzonera.\"\r\n\r\nOne can live while waiting for the crops to come up, for many crops\r\nmature rapidly.\r\n\r\nSpecialties give employment only during a few months of each year\r\nand bring returns only at periods of the year, but the returns can\r\nbe made almost immediate and the work almost continuous.\r\n\r\nLong Island and Jersey farmers in marketing their crops sell\r\n\r\n  Spinach and Radishes in April\r\n  Peas, Early Onions, and Lettuce in May\r\n  Asparagus and Strawberries in June\r\n  Tomatoes, Cucumbers, and Cabbage Seeds in July\r\n  Early Potatoes, Peaches, and Beans in August\r\n  Onions and Potatoes in September\r\n  Celery in October\r\n  Cauliflower in November\r\n  Cauliflower and Brussels Sprouts in December\r\n  Cauliflower and Brussels Sprouts in January\r\n  Brussels Sprouts in February\r\n  Brussels Sprouts in March\r\n\r\nThis order of crops can be varied to suit conditions.\r\n\r\n\"The old practice of growing vegetables in beds usually entails more\r\nlabor and expense than the crop is worth; and it has had the effect\r\nof driving more than one boy from the farm. These beds always need\r\nweeding on Saturdays, holidays, circus days, and the Fourth of July.\r\nEven if the available area is only twenty feet wide, the rows should\r\nrun lengthwise and be far enough apart (from one to two feet for\r\nsmall stuff) to allow of the use of the hand wheelhoes, many of\r\nwhich are very efficient. If land is available for horse tillage,\r\nnone of the rows should be less than thirty inches apart, and for\r\nlate growing things, as large cabbage, four feet is better. If the\r\nrows are long, it may be necessary to grow two or three kinds of\r\nvegetables in the same row; in this case it is important that\r\nvegetables requiring the same general treatment and similar length\r\nof season be grown together. For example, a row containing parsnips\r\nand salsify, or parsnips, salsify, and late carrots would afford an\r\nideal combination; but a row containing parsnips, cabbages, and\r\nlettuce would be a very faulty combination. One part of the area\r\nshould be set aside for all similar crops. For example, all root\r\ncrops might be grown on one side of the plot, all cabbage crops in\r\nthe adjoining space, all tomato and eggplant crops in the center,\r\nall corn and tall things on the opposite side. Perennnial crops, as\r\nasparagus and rhubarb, and gardening structures, as hotbeds and\r\nframes, should be on the border, where they will not interfere with\r\nthe plowing and tilling.\" (\"Principles of Vegetable Gardening,\" page\r\n31.)\r\n\r\nUsually where large acreages are worked there is a tendency to\r\ndevote a greater portion of the land to one crop and sometimes a\r\nfailure in this crop will mean ruin to the farmer, whereas, where\r\nsmall areas are used, there is generally a diversity of the\r\nhigher-priced crops and a failure in one is not so likely to be\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nTo get the greatest production from the soil two crops can be grown\r\nin the same soil at the same time--one of which will mature much\r\nearlier than the other, thereby giving its place up just about the\r\nperiod of growth when the second crop would need more room. This is\r\nknown as companion cropping.\r\n\r\n\"In companion cropping there is a main crop and a secondary crop.\r\nOrdinarily the main crop occupies the middle part and later part of\r\nthe season. The secondary crop matures early in the season, leaving\r\nthe ground free for the main crop. In some cases the same species is\r\nused for both crops, as when late celery is planted between the rows\r\nof early celery.\r\n\r\nFollowing are examples of some companion crops:\r\n\r\n  Radishes with beets or carrots. The radishes can be sold before the\r\n  beets need the room.\r\n\r\n  Corn with squashes, citron, pumpkin, or beans in hills.\r\n  Early onions and cauliflower or cabbage.\r\n  Horseradish and early cabbage.\r\n  Lettuce with early cabbage.\"\r\n\r\n  (\"Principles of Vegetable Gardening,\" page 184.)\r\n\r\nIf fruit trees be planted, vegetables may be grown in rows. As soon\r\nas the early vegetables mature they are removed, and a midsummer\r\ncrop planted. These are followed by a fall or winter crop.\r\n\r\nRadishes, lettuce, and cabbage grow at the same time and on the area\r\nformerly used for one crop. Early potatoes and early cauliflower are\r\nfollowed by Brussels sprouts and celery, two crops being as easily\r\ngrown as one by intelligent handling. The best beans are grown among\r\nfruit trees.\r\n\r\nThe principles of \"double-cropping\" are summarized by Professor\r\nThomas Shaw, in _The Market Garden._\r\n\r\n\"Onion sets may be planted early in the season and onion seeds may\r\nthen be sown. Between the rows cauliflower may be planted. Later\r\nbetween the cauliflower, two or three cucumber seeds may be dropped.\r\nThe onion sets up around the cauliflower may be taken out first, and\r\nthe cauliflowers in turn may be removed in time to let the cucumbers\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n\"Midway between the rows of onions grown from seeds, we can plant\r\nradishes, lettuce, peppergrass, spinach, or some other early relish,\r\nwhich will have ample time to grow and to be consumed before harm\r\ncan come to the onions from the shade of any one of these crops.\r\nWhen the onions are well grown, turnips can be sown midway between\r\ntheir rows.\"\r\n\r\nSo we get two crops of onions, besides cauliflowers, cucumbers, and\r\nturnips off the same place. Weeds won't have much chance in soil\r\ntreated like that.\r\n\r\n\"Multum in Parvo Gardening\" (Samuel Wood) claims L 620 ($3100)\r\nfrom one acre by the expenditure of considerable capital in growing\r\nfruit against brick walls--it cost over $3100 to prepare the land,\r\nof which the walls cost $2300. In this system the fruit trees are\r\npruned and trained till they look like firemen's ladders.\r\n\r\n\"In the suburbs of Paris, even without such costly things with only\r\nthirty-six yards of frames for seedlings, vegetables are grown in\r\nthe open air to the value of L 200 per acre.\" (\"Fields,\r\nFactories and Workshops,\" page 80.)\r\n\r\n\"At the present time, for fully 100 miles along the Rhone, and in\r\nthe lateral valleys of the Ardeche and the Drome, the country is an\r\nadmirable orchard, from which millions worth of fruit is exported,\r\nand the land attains the selling price of from L 325 ($1625) to\r\nL 400 ($2000) the acre. Small plots of land are continually\r\nreclaimed for culture upon every crag.\" (Same, page 133.)\r\n\r\nIn California we hear (from George P. Keeney) that while good truck\r\nand fruit lands usually sell for $25 to $350 per acre, the land with\r\nfull-bearing fruit or nut trees often sells at $1000, and even up to\r\n$2000 per acre. There is no reason why any intelligent persons\r\nshould not make their land increase in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe London Daily News reports that in one year, which was not a good\r\nseason for all crops, on a half acre of land, Mr. Henry Vincent, of\r\nBrighton, England, raised the following products:\r\n\r\n2660 cabbages, 70 bushels spinach, 950 cauliflowers, parsley, 1460\r\nlettuces, 660 broccoli, 16 bushels potatoes, 19-1/4 bushels Brussels\r\nsprouts, 106-1/2 gallons peas, 120 gallons artichokes, flowers, 267\r\nvegetable marrows, 2976 carrots, 264 bundles radishes, 14 gallons\r\nFrench beans, 12 gallons currants' 95-1/2 punnets mustard, 27 pounds\r\nmushrooms, rhubarb, 948 bushels sprout tops, 38 dozen leeks, 1150\r\nplants, 11-1/4 gallons broad beans, 97 bundles sea-kale, 978 bundles\r\nof asparagus-kale, 504 beet roots, 2913 gallons gooseberries, 219\r\nbundles mint, 20 bundles sage, 18 bundles of fennel, thyme, besides\r\none cartload of stones.\r\n\r\nMr. Vincent explains how he came to go into intensive cultivation:\r\n\"A few years ago the doctors said if I did not go out more I could\r\nnot live. Very well, just at that time there was an outcry about the\r\nland not paying for cultivation. I could not understand this, for as\r\na boy at seven years of age I had to go out to farm work, therefore\r\nI never went to school. Anyhow I thought something was very wrong if\r\nthe land would not pay; so, to compel myself to go out in the fresh\r\nair, I took an allotment on the Sussex Downs to work in the early\r\nmorning before my daily duties began. I might say that I am a\r\nwaiter, and have been in my present situation forty years, so you\r\ncan understand I could not know much of land or garden work I could\r\nnot see my way clear in the few spare hours I get to take more than\r\nhalf an acre of land to garden early, especially as I started\r\nknowing practically nothing about such work, but I can manage to do\r\nmy half acre all alone.\r\n\r\n\"My garden is situated on the Brighton Race Hill ridge, and twelve\r\nyears ago it was but four inches of soil on chalk, but I now have a\r\nfoot of soil on the whole of the half acre, and year by year my\r\nprofits increase.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, get the men to stop on the land in this country. We ought not\r\nto have workhouses. Every man could live, and live well, if he could\r\nget the land, and would work it as it should be worked.\r\n\r\n\"Farmers and landowners grumble because the land does not pay. Now\r\nfor the fault. It is quite evident it is not the land, therefore, it\r\nmust be the fault of the man. Very well, get the land from these\r\nlanded proprietors, by sale preferred, and let it out to men, not by\r\n1000 acres, as no man can farm well a thousand acres in England; let\r\nthe farms be greatly reduced, and then the land can be treated as it\r\nshould be. Most of us have children, and we all know how we love and\r\ntreat them. Treat the land in the same manner, feed it, and keep it\r\nclean, and you will have no cause to complain. The land of old\r\nEngland is as good as it ever was.\r\n\r\n\"I have serious thoughts of opening a kind of school for people who\r\nwould like to make $500 a year on an acre. It is to be done, and\r\ndone easily. I do know that one man alone can manage two acres, and\r\nat the end of this year I shall be able to tell how much more he can\r\nmanage alone, so under my system one can gain L 4 a week off two\r\nacres and do all one's self.\r\n\r\n\"If the land will produce over one hundred pounds per year per acre,\r\nis it not wrong for a man to have, say, 500 or 1000 acres which in\r\nno way can he properly manage; as, in the first place, he cannot\r\nfeed such an acreage, let alone keep it clean and gather in his\r\ncrops?\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, what an acre may produce depends on time, place, and\r\ncircumstances The product of the best acre of land so situated that\r\nits product could be sold at retail in a near-by market, and which\r\nhas been cultivated under the best management for a term of years,\r\nwould provide a very comfortable living. The product of other acres,\r\nmeasured by what they produce to the cultivator in living, declines\r\nthrough various grades down to almost nothing on the acre far from\r\nrailroads or difficult of access.\r\n\r\nWhile in quantity and quality the least favored acre could be made\r\nto produce as much as one best situated, yet, almost none of its\r\nproduction would be available to sell, while the product of the\r\nfavorably located acre could be sold as rapidly as grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the kitchen garden is to provide an abundance and variety\r\nof food for the family. As the object of the cultivator is to get\r\nthe largest product for his labor, he ought to produce all that he\r\ncan consume on the least possible area. Though one may go into\r\nmushrooms or frog raising as a money crop, the kitchen garden is the\r\nfirst indispensable and should first be given attention.\r\n\r\nFor a garden choose a piece of land with a southern exposure,\r\nsheltered on the north and west by woods, buildings, hedge, or any\r\nkind of a windbreak. This arrangement will give the earliest garden,\r\nfor it gets all the sun there is. By running the rows north and\r\nsouth, the rays of the sun strike the eastern side of the row in the\r\nmorning, and the western side in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe best time to take hold of a piece of land is in the fall,\r\nbecause then it can be plowed ready for the spring planting. The\r\nalternate freezing and thawing during the winter breaks up the sod\r\nand the stiff lumps thrown up by the plow, so rendering the soil\r\npliable and easily worked. This is especially true of land that has\r\nbeen reclaimed from the forest, or which has not been farmed for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nBefore the plowing is done, the land for the garden should be\r\nmanured at the rate of twenty-five large wagon loads to the acre. If\r\nyou can get a suitable plot that has been in red clover, alfalfa,\r\nsoy beans, or cowpeas for a number of years, so much the better.\r\nThese plants have on their roots nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which\r\ndraw nitrogen from the air. Nitrogen is the great meat-maker and\r\nforces a prolonged and rapid growth of all vegetables.\r\n\r\nAfter manuring and plowing, harrow repeatedly with a disk or cutaway\r\nharrow until the soil is as fine as dust. Then you have a seed bed\r\nwhich will give the fine roots a chance to grow as soon as the seeds\r\nsprout. Too much stress cannot be laid upon the importance of\r\nthoroughly working the soil at this time. Every stone, weed, or clod\r\nthat is left in the soil destroys to that extent the source from\r\nwhich the plants can get their food.\r\n\r\nA quarter-acre garden, which is big enough to supply the whole\r\nfamily with a succession of vegetables for summer and fall, as well\r\nas some potatoes and turnips for winter, will take a diligent\r\nworkman about four days to dig over and three days to plant. The\r\nfour days' work of digging will need to be done only once. The time\r\nspent upon planting succession crops will depend upon the amount of\r\nthe garden reserved for rotation. The part kept for lettuce,\r\nradishes, spinach, beets, Swiss chard, peas, string and wax beans\r\nmay be digged over in a favorable season for three successive\r\nplantings, while the part devoted to early potatoes would need to be\r\ndigged only twice--once when the planting is done, and again when\r\ncrop is gathered and the ground be prepared for a crop of late\r\ncabbage or turnips. A planting table for vegetables, which is\r\ncomplete and comprehensive, is distributed free by the National\r\nEmergency Food Garden Commission at Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nIt is far more important to plant seeds at the proper depth than\r\nthat they should be planted thinly or thickly, for if they are\r\nplanted too thin, it makes a sort of advantage by giving the\r\nindividual plants ample room to develop to large size; and if\r\nplanted too thick, the evil can easily be remedied by thinning or\r\ntransplanting.\r\n\r\nAfter the seeds come up, the size of almost all the vegetables can\r\nbe increased by transplanting, in favorable soil, which gives each\r\nplant room for complete development.\r\n\r\nIt is too expensive to risk part of the land being unused or half\r\nused on account of seeds dying, or to put in so many seeds in order\r\nto insure growth that they will crowd one another. Where possible,\r\ntherefore, seeds should be sprouted and planted, not \"sown.\"\r\n\r\nLima beans planted on edge with eye down will come up much sooner\r\nthan if dropped in carelessly so they have to turn themselves over.\r\nIn a small garden the time saved by such planting will repay the\r\nextra trouble.\r\n\r\nIn some things like onions and radishes, however, it is better to\r\nsow them thick, and then thin them out, so as to get the effect of\r\ntransplanting without so much labor. In others, like lettuce and all\r\nthe salad plants, transplanting gives new life and energy and\r\ndevelops the individual plants in a way that will astonish those not\r\nfamiliar with what free development means.\r\n\r\nIt is wise to plant corn after lettuce and radishes are gathered,\r\nand more lettuce, corn, or salad, after the beans are picked. Then\r\nlate crops, cabbage, cauliflower or spinach, can go where early corn\r\ngrew, so that the small patch may earn your living and pay big\r\ndividends.\r\n\r\nDo not let two vegetables of the same botanical family follow each\r\nother. For instance, lima beans should not follow green beans or\r\npeas, as all the family draw about the same elements from the soil,\r\nand are likely to have the same insects and diseases.\r\n\r\nDo not plant cucumbers, squash, or pumpkins too near each other, as\r\nthey will often inter-impregnate and produce uneatable hybrids.\r\n\r\nDecide what you are going to do with your crop before you plant it,\r\nwhether to sell it, at wholesale or at retail, to eat it, or to feed\r\nit to stock.\r\n\r\nC. E. Hunn, in the Garden Magazine, gives the following arrangement:\r\n\"For the beginner who wants to get fresh vegetables and fruits from\r\nMay until midwinter, a space 100 X 200 feet is enough.\r\n\r\n\"1. Plant in rows, not beds, and avoid the backache.\r\n\r\n\"2. Plant vegetables that mature at the same time near one another.\r\n\r\n\"3. Plant vegetables of the same height near together--tall ones\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"4. Run the rows the short way, for convenience in cultivation and\r\nbecause one hundred feet of anything is enough.\r\n\r\n\"5. Put the permanent vegetables (asparagus, rhubarb, sweet herbs)\r\nat one side, so that the rest will be easy to plow.\r\n\r\n\"6. Practice rotation. Do not put vines where they were last. Put\r\ncorn in a different place. The other important groups for rotation\r\nare root crops (including potatoes and onions); cabbage tribe, peas\r\nand beans, tomatoes, eggplant and pepper, salad plants.\r\n\r\n\"7. Don't grow potatoes in a small garden. They aren't worth the\r\nbother.\r\n\r\n\"By training on trellis or wire, the smaller fruit plantings can be\r\nmade much closer.\r\n\r\n\"If fruits are wanted in the garden, plant a row of apple trees\r\nalong the northern border, plums and pears on the western sides,\r\ncherries and peaches on the eastern side. Next the apple trees run a\r\ngrape trellis; and then in succession east and west, run a row of\r\nblackberries, raspberries, gooseberries, and currants. These rows,\r\nwith the apple trees, form a windbreak, and besides adding to the\r\nincome, protect the vegetables. Next to the bush fruits, between\r\nthem and the ends of the vegetable rows, put rhubarb, asparagus, and\r\nstrawberries.\"\r\n\r\nInsect pests must be watched for and their destructive work checked.\r\nAshes, slaked lime, or any kind of dust or powder destroy most\r\ninsects which prey on the leaves of plants. The reason for this is\r\nthat the dust closes the pores through which the insects breathe. It\r\nshould therefore be applied when the leaves are dry.\r\n\r\nCutworms can be destroyed by winter plowing. Rotation of vegetables\r\nwill reduce the damage from insects, because each family has its\r\npeculiar bugs. By constant change to new soil, the pests have no\r\nopportunity to get a foothold.\r\n\r\nWith bugs, as with boys, only those who are interested in them and\r\ntherefore understand them can manage them. It is fun to study the\r\ninsects--and it pays.\r\n\r\nHere's another use of \"land.\" Maybe a pool in your garden or a dam\r\nin a little brook in it may help out your home garden bank account.\r\nOf course a pond a few square yards in extent will give even better\r\nreturns if you can sell its produce at retail near by.\r\n\r\nW. B. Shaw, a seventy-year-old veteran who lost his right arm during\r\nthe Civil War, lives in Kenilworth, D. C., and clears $1500 an acre\r\nevery year out of mud puddles--if mud puddles can be measured by the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw is a pond lily farmer, and despite his lack of his good\r\nright arm, he poles his boat about his mud puddles and gathers in\r\nthe pond lilies. His is not exactly a \"dry farm\" and neither wet nor\r\ncloudy weather bothers him. Furthermore, the demand for his pond\r\nlilies in Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and even New York,\r\nand Chicago, is greater than he can supply.\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw secured this swamp for almost nothing, as it was considered\r\nworthless. He divided it into fifteen pools with little dams between\r\nthem, and rollers on the dams to enable him to drag his boat from\r\none to the other. From May to late in September he is busy every\r\nmorning gathering lilies. His average is about 500 a morning, which\r\nhe ships in little galvanized iron tanks with wet moss.\r\n\r\nMany school children know how to get results on a little land. Mr.\r\nMahoney, Superintendent of the Fairview Garden School, Yonkers, New\r\nYork, estimates that the total value of produce grown on the 250\r\ngardens, composing the school plot, in all about one and one quarter\r\nacres of land, was $1308, or at the rate of more than a thousand\r\ndollars per acre. When it is taken into consideration that all the\r\nlabor was done by boys ranging in age from eight to twelve years,\r\nthis result is truly astonishing.\r\n\r\nWhat may not adult skilled labor produce when applied freely to the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTOOLS AND EQUIPMENT--SPECIALIZED CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo subdue the land with an ax, a plow and a spade is possible;\r\nmillions of acres have been so subdued. This method, however, is the\r\nmost expensive of all, as in our times, markets won't wait, and the\r\nman who wants to get on must produce as quickly as possible. To do\r\nso, he must have the best tools. They will pay for themselves many\r\ntimes over in a single year. For the farm, the following list, in\r\naddition to a well-stocked tool chest (hammer, saw, plane, ax, etc.)\r\ncovers the indispensible:\r\n\r\n  1 team horses (these may be hired) $200.00\r\n  1 walking plow 10.00\r\n  1 disk or cutaway harrow 25.00\r\n  1 farm wagon 50.00\r\n  1 cultivator (two horse) 25.00\r\n  1 one-horse cultivator 8.00\r\n  Shovels, pick, mattock or grubbing hoe 10.00\r\n  Work harness for two horses 25.00\r\n\r\n  TOTAL $353.00\r\n\r\nThese things you must have to get the land in proper shape for seeds\r\nor plants; but special crops require special tools. A scythe is good\r\nto keep weeds away from fences. A sickle is handy to keep down\r\ngrass. To reduce living expenses, a cow for $60, and fifty hens at\r\nfifty cents each, say $25, will supply a large family with milk and\r\neggs. Most people make the mistake of buying too many things and\r\nthese poorly selected. It is better to have too few tools than too\r\nmany, for tools are often dropped where last used, and so are lost.\r\nThen if money is scarce, you may not be able to make a shelter for\r\nyour machines and tools, and they will rust through the winter. Many\r\nfarmers, through neglect, have to replace their tool equipment every\r\nfour or five years, but with attention and care, the original\r\nequipment, even to the team, ought still to be in use twenty years\r\nafter their purchase. I know many instances where this is true. The\r\nabove equipment is the minimum for beginning work. The character of\r\nadditions to it will depend much upon the crops which you select as\r\nthe money getters.\r\n\r\nFor general market gardening and the kitchen garden too, the\r\nfollowing tool list, together with the above, will include\r\neverything absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n  Wheel hoe $6.00\r\n  Spade and fork, each $1.00 2.00\r\n  Push hoe .65\r\n  Watering can .60\r\n  Rake and common hoe 1.00\r\n  Bulb sprayer .25\r\n  Trowel .10\r\n\r\n  TOTAL $10.60\r\n\r\nThe wheel hoe is a great saver--of backache, especially to the\r\nbeginner; as Warner says, \"at the best you will conclude that for\r\ngardening purposes a cast-iron back with a hinge in it is preferable\r\nto the ones now in use.\"\r\n\r\nThe dibble, an old tool handle, or a bit of broomstick sharpened,\r\nand garden lines to get the rows straight, labels, tomato supports,\r\nplant protectors and stakes earl all be homemade out of old\r\nmaterial. The full outfit would include the following:\r\n\r\n  Roller $8.00\r\n  Wheel-hoe with seeder 8.50\r\n  Sprayer 3.75\r\n  Wheelbarrow 4.00\r\n  Crowbar 1.50\r\n  Weeder .35\r\n\r\nFor such crops as admit of horse cultivation a horse hoe will save a\r\ngreat deal of time.\r\n\r\nThe weeder is a cousin to the push hoe and has a zigzag blade for\r\ncutting off young weeds which are just starting above ground. It is\r\npushed backward and forward and cuts both ways. It is very good for\r\nsoft ground; on a harder patch use the push hoe.\r\n\r\nA market garden is really a big kitchen garden, from which the\r\ncultivator supplies not only his own family, but his neighbors, the\r\npublic. To run a successful market garden for profit, land suitably\r\nsituated near transportation and markets, a large supply of stable\r\nmanure, hotbeds for raising plants, crates for shipping, wagons for\r\ndelivering, and a complete outfit of tools are necessary. You must\r\nraise all sorts of vegetables and salad plants in quantities\r\nsufficiently large to justify you in giving your whole time to the\r\nwork. An acre devoted to general market gardening could be attended\r\nto by two men with some extra help for marketing.\r\n\r\nTo get a place fully established on new, rich land requires two or\r\nthree years. On worn-out land it would take longer to build it up to\r\nthe high fertility needed for maximum production. Crops like\r\nasparagus and rhubarb take two years to establish on a remunerative\r\nbasis. If bush fruits are raised, three years are required to get\r\nmaximum results. So in starting, land should be bought outright or\r\nleased for ten years.\r\n\r\nIn market gardening for profit, one acre might be devoted to\r\nvegetables, one acre to small fruits; strawberries, raspberries,\r\nblackberries, currants, gooseberries, etc. and one acre kept for\r\nbuildings, poultry, etc. An energetic man could clear one thousand\r\ndollars a year besides his living, after he got a start, and be\r\nabsolutely independent; that is, unless some predatory railroad\r\ncorporation could confiscate his profits before his product reached\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nSome persons are just naturally so successful with plants that if\r\nthey stuck an umbrella in the ground we should expect to see it\r\nblossom out into parasols--but they don't know why it does, and they\r\ncan't teach any one else how to do it.\r\n\r\nAny fool can sneer at \"book farming\" or at anything else, but you\r\ncan hardly succeed without the best books by practical men. Do not\r\nlet some experienced ignoramus talk you out of experimenting under\r\ntheir guidance. You will learn little without experience, and unless\r\nyou have the grower's instinct, you will learn less without books.\r\n\r\nDon't be hypnotized by long experience or by success. Hardly anybody\r\nknows his own business. You must have noticed that few of the people\r\nyou buy of or sell to, know any more of their goods than you do.\r\n\r\nIt is just the same with trades. Hardly a barber knows that he\r\nshould not shave you against the grain of the skin. Even the cat\r\nwon't stand being rubbed up the wrong way; but the barber never\r\nthought of that.\r\n\r\nWe lawyers and the doctors are supposed to be thorough in our own\r\nfield--I said lately to one of the ablest men at the New York Bar,\r\n\"About one lawyer in a hundred knows his business.\" He said, \"That\r\nis a gross overestimate.\" Shortly after I talked with three Judges,\r\none of the City Court, one of the Supreme Court, and one of the\r\nUnited States Circuit, and they each agreed that my friend's remark\r\nwas about true, and that in most cases litigants would do as well\r\nwithout lawyers as with them.\r\n\r\nIf that is true, what chance is there that an uneducated man who has\r\n\"raised garden sass ever since he was a boy, and seen his father do\r\nit before him,\" can teach you correctly?\r\n\r\nMen learn very slowly by experience, because no two experiences are\r\nexactly alike, unless they perceive and apply the principles under\r\nthe experience.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent man accustomed to investigation can learn more about\r\na specialty in a week's study than an untrained practitioner can\r\nbelieve in a year.\r\n\r\nWhat the untrained teacher can tell us is of little account; what he\r\nshows us is another matter.\r\n\r\nTherefore get help who know that they don't know anything about a\r\ngarden and who consequently will do with a will exactly what you\r\ntell them to do; such labor is cheap--why should you pay extravagant\r\nprices for skill to a man who has succeeded so poorly that he can\r\nonly earn day's wages? You can get much better knowledge at less\r\ncost from a book. Study and put your knowledge into practice\r\nyourself, where you see promise of a profit.\r\n\r\nAlmost every crop can be made a specialty. In proportion as special\r\ncrops are profitable when conditions are right, so are they sources\r\nof loss when things go wrong. If, after your first season in the\r\ncountry, some special crop takes your fancy, give extra space and\r\ntime to it the second year and see if you are successful in handling\r\nan eighth or a quarter acre. If so, you may extend your operations\r\nas rapidly as purse and market permit.\r\n\r\nBefore concentrating upon any crop as the chief source of income, a\r\ncareful study must be made of all the conditions surrounding its\r\nproduction; a crop is not produced in the broad meaning of that term\r\nuntil it is actually in the hands of the consumer.\r\n\r\nPotatoes, for instance, are grown by the hundred acres in sections\r\nadapted to their growth, and special machinery costing hundreds of\r\ndollars is used in planting, cultivating, and harvesting the crop.\r\nThe good shipping and keeping qualities of the potato enable it to\r\nbe raised far from markets and so brings into competition cheap land\r\nworked in large areas, with large capital. In spite of this,\r\nhowever, the small cultivator can usually make money if he can sell\r\nhis potatoes directly to the consumer.\r\n\r\nIf your land is so situated that you can put your individuality into\r\nthe crop and can control all the circumstances, preparation of land,\r\nplanting, cultivation, harvesting, and marketing, your chances of\r\nsuccess are immeasurably increased. As soon as any important part\r\nmust be trusted to some one beyond your control, danger arises.\r\nAssiduous care in planting, cultivating, and packing will avail\r\nnothing if the product falls into the hands of transportation\r\ncompanies or commission merchants indifferent as to what becomes of\r\nit. It is therefore better to be quite independent, sell your own\r\ncrop, and have the whole operation in your own hands from the very\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, seed growing for the market is a highly\r\ndeveloped special business which is usually carried on by companies\r\noperating with large capital, able to employ the best experts, and\r\nto avail themselves of all the advantages of scientific methods in\r\nculture, regardless of expense. So uncertain is the business, that\r\neven with all these facilities, they rarely guarantee seeds. It is\r\nobvious that the amateur has little chance of succeeding in such a\r\ndifficult business. Nevertheless, he will be able after a few\r\nseasons of increasing experience to gather seeds from selected\r\nplants and so furnish his own supply. It must be borne in mind,\r\nhowever, that plants can be improved by cross breeding and that by\r\nkeeping a variety too long on the same ground its quality\r\ndeteriorates, and the plant tends to revert to the type natural to\r\nit before domestication.\r\n\r\nWhen land is cropped every season, the nitrogen, potash, and\r\nphosphorus removed from the soil must be replaced in some form,\r\notherwise you have diminishing returns, while the expense for labor\r\nis the same. In farming small areas for specialties you cannot\r\neasily invoke the principle of rotation by enriching the land with\r\nlegumes, to be plowed under while green, the bacteria on the roots\r\nof which gather nitrogen from the air, but you must get stable\r\nmanure or buy chemical fertilizers to maintain the fertility.\r\n\r\nSpecial crops divide themselves naturally into two classes: those\r\nraised for immediate shipment to market, and those to be hauled to\r\ncanneries. The first type are generally prepared in a more expensive\r\nway, and need more care and attention. Each class requires its own\r\nspecial forms of packing to conform to market peculiarities fixed by\r\nthe taste of consumers.\r\n\r\nFor the cultivation of all specialties, many items of preparation\r\nare identical. Land must be well drained, it must contain a\r\nsufficient amount of humus, or decaying vegetable matter, to make it\r\nloose and porous; it must be free from sticks and stones or any\r\nforeign matter likely to impede cultivation or obstruct growth. The\r\nproper formation of a seed bed is a prime prerequisite to successful\r\ncropping. After the land is manured and plowed it should be gone\r\nover in all directions with a disk and smoothing harrow, until it is\r\nof a dustlike fineness.\r\n\r\nIn thorough cultivation before the crop is planted, lies the secret\r\nof many a success, and in its neglect the cause of many failures.\r\nIntelligent handling of crops is in a large measure knowledge of the\r\ninfluence of wind and rain, sunshine and darkness, on the particular\r\nnature of the plant Delicate plants, for example, ought to be grown\r\nwhere buildings or forests break the force of prevailing winds.\r\nSheltered valleys in irrigated sections have proved the best for\r\nintensive cultivation. For thousands of years in China and Japan the\r\nconditions of successful intensive cultivation have been well\r\nunderstood, and to-day the most efficient gardeners are the Chinese.\r\nIn some parts of Mexico, for the same reasons, intensive cultivation\r\nhas reached a high development. In our own West we are catching up\r\non vegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANTAGES FROM CAPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen what a worker with very little money can do and how he\r\ncan succeed. A small capital, however, can be used to increase the\r\nreturns to as great advantage on a small farm as large capital can\r\nbe used on a large farm and with much less risk.\r\n\r\nStable manure is still the favorite article with the masses of\r\ngardeners. One ton of ordinary stable manure contains about 1275\r\npounds of organic matter, carrying eight pounds of nitrogen, ten\r\npounds of potash, and four pounds of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nWhen thoroughly rotted, the manure acquires a still larger\r\npercentage of plant food; it is more valuable, not only for that\r\nreason, but also on account of its immediate availability. Further,\r\nthe mechanical effect of this manure in opening and loosening the\r\nsoil, allowing air and warmth to enter more freely, adds greatly to\r\nits value.\r\n\r\nIt is easily gotten and often goes wholly or in part to waste. On\r\nthe outskirts of some towns may be seen a collection of manure piles\r\nthat have been hauled out and dumped in waste places. The plant food\r\nin each ton of this manure is worth at least two dollars--that is\r\nthe least Eastern farmers pay for similar material, and they make\r\nmoney doing it. Yet almost every liveryman has to pay some one for\r\nhauling the manure away. This is simply because farmers living near\r\nthese towns are missing a chance to secure something for\r\nnothing--because, perhaps, the profit is not directly in sight. But\r\nfrom most soils there is a handsome profit possible from a very\r\nsmall application of stable manure.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this, I saw a man in New Rochelle, N. Y.; dumping a\r\nload of street sweepings into a hole in a vacant lot. It would have\r\nbeen less wasteful to have dumped a bushel of potatoes into the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nCommercial fertilizers are coming more and more in use by market\r\ngardeners, and with reason. If we examine a good fertilizer,\r\nanalyzing five per cent available nitrogen, six per cent phosphoric\r\nacid, and 8 per cent potash, we shall find that one ton of it\r\ncontains, besides less valuable ingredients: 100 lb. nitrogen, 120\r\nlb. phosphoric acid, 160 lb. potash.\r\n\r\nSuch fertilizers probably retail at forty to sixty dollars per ton,\r\nand are fully worth it. All this plant food, and perhaps one half\r\nmore, can be drawn in a single load, while it will take ten such\r\nloads of stable manure to supply the same amount of plant food.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to be afraid of too much fertilizer, provided it\r\nis evenly distributed and thoroughly mixed through properly prepared\r\nsoil. Stinginess in this item is poor economy.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is the most essential food for plant growth. It is an\r\nimportant element of plant food in manure. In ordinary manure most\r\nof the value is due to the nitrogen, although phosphoric acid and\r\npotash are also present. It is found in the most available form in\r\nnitrate of soda. Nitrate of soda will benefit all crops, but it does\r\nnot follow that it will pay to use it on all crops. Its cost makes\r\nit unprofitable to use on cheap crops; but on those that yield a\r\nlarge return nitrate of soda is a very profitable investment.\r\n\r\n\"It is shown in the experiments conducted with nitrate of soda on\r\ndifferent crops that in the case of grain and forage crops, which\r\nutilized the nitrate quite as completely as the market garden crops,\r\nthe increased value of crops due to nitrate does not in any case\r\nexceed $14 per acre, or a money return at the rate of $8.50 per 100\r\npounds of nitrate used, while in the case of the market-garden crops\r\nthe value of the increased yield reaches, in the case of one crop,\r\nthe high figure of over $263 per acre, or at the rate of about $66\r\nper 100 pounds of nitrate.\" (New Jersey Agricultural Experiment\r\nStations, page 8, No. 172.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Voorhees, of the same station, experimented with tomatoes,\r\nwith these results:\r\n\r\n  Manure and Fertilizer Used Cost Per Acre Value of Crop\r\n\r\n  No manure $271.88\r\n  30 tons barnyard manure $30.00 291.75\r\n  8 tons manure and 400 lb. fertilizer 15.00 317.63\r\n  160 pounds nitrate of soda alone 4.00 361.13\r\n\r\nSuch common crops as tomatoes, cabbage, turnips, beets, etc., in\r\norder to be highly profitable, must be grown and harvested early;\r\nany one can grow them in their regular season; their growth must be\r\npromoted or forced as much as possible, at the time when the natural\r\nagencies are not active in the change of soil nitrogen into\r\navailable forms, and the plants must, therefore, be supplied\r\nartificially with the active forms of nitrogen, if a rapid and\r\ncontinuous growth is to be maintained.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to have a return of $50 per acre from the use\r\nof $5 worth of nitrate of soda on crops of high value, as, for\r\nexample, early tomatoes, beets, cabbage, etc. This is an\r\nextraordinary return for the money and labor invested; still, if the\r\nincreased value of the crop were but $10, or even $8, it would be a\r\nprofitable investment, since no more land and but little additional\r\ncapital was required in order to obtain the extra $5 or $8 per acre.\r\n\r\nThe results of all the experiments conducted in different parts of\r\nthe country and in different seasons, show an average gain in yield\r\nof early tomatoes of about fifty per cent, with an average increased\r\nvalue of crop of about $100 per acre. The rest of the report shows\r\nsimilar results with other crops. (New Jersey Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, Bulletin 172.)\r\n\r\nJoseph Harris says, \"Some years ego we used nitrate of soda\r\ncautiously as a top dressing on the celery plants. The effect was\r\nastonishing. The next year, having more confidence, we spread the\r\nnitrate at the time we sowed the seed, and again after the plant\r\ncame up, and twice afterward during a rain.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of finding it difficult to get the plants early enough for\r\nthe celery growers who set them out, they were ready three weeks\r\nbefore the usual time of transplanting.\r\n\r\n\"At the four applications, we probably used 1600 lb. of nitrate of\r\nsoda per acre, and this would probably furnish more nitric acid to\r\nthe plants than they could get from five hundred tons of manure per\r\nacre, provided it had been possible to have worked such a quantity\r\ninto the soil. Never were finer plants grown. As compared with the\r\nincreased value of the plants, the cost of the nitrate is not worth\r\ntaking into consideration.\"\r\n\r\nAs a means of fertilization without the use of artificial\r\nfertilizer, soil inoculation has come. It has grown out of the\r\ndiscovery of the dependence of leguminous plants on bacteria which\r\nlive on their roots. The discovery is one of the most important of\r\nthose made in modern agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt has received its greatest impetus in America, under the\r\nexperiments of Professor Moore of the United States Agricultural\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe Department supplied free to farmers the bacteria for\r\ninoculation. Now they supply it only for experimental purposes. A\r\nlaboratory has been fitted up for the work. The method is to\r\npropagate bacteria for each of the various leguminous plants such as\r\nclover, alfalfa, soy beans, cow peas, tares, and velvet beans. All\r\nof these plants are of incalculable value in different sections of\r\nthe country as forage for farm animals. In the West, alfalfa is the\r\nmain reliance for stockraisers. The farmers of the East are trying\r\nto establish it, but meet with difficulty chiefly for want of the\r\nspecial bacteria which should be found on the roots.\r\n\r\nThe function of these bacteria is to gather the nitrogen of the air\r\nand supply it as plant food. Without the bacteria the plant can get\r\nonly the nitrogen which is supplied from the soil in fertilizers.\r\nWith the aid of the bacteria the growing plant can derive the\r\ngreater part of its food from the air.\r\n\r\nHere is one of the results of the use of inoculated seed as reported\r\nby the United States Agricultural Bulletin No. 214.\r\n\r\nG. L. Thomas, experimenting with field peas on his farm near Auburn,\r\nMe., made a special test with fertilized and unfertilized strips,\r\nand stated that \"inoculated seed did as much without fertilizers of\r\nany kind, as uninoculated seed supplied with fertilizer (phosphate)\r\nat the rate of 800 pounds and a ton of barnyard manure per acre.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to be only in its infancy. The Department warns us that\r\nnitrogen inoculation is useless where the soil already has enough\r\nnitrogen and where other plant foods are absent.\r\n\r\nThe experiments are most important, and we are probably on the eve\r\nof as great advances in agriculture as in electricity, but the human\r\nrace has a great love for \"inoculation,\" and indeed for all\r\nunnatural processes.\r\n\r\nYou remember the story of the wonderful coon that Chandler Harris\r\ntells? No? They were constantly seeing this enormous coon, but\r\nalways just as they almost got their hands on him, he disappeared.\r\nOne night the boys came running in to say that the wonderful coon\r\nwas up in a persimmon tree in the middle of a ten-acre lot; so they\r\ngot the dogs and the lanterns and guns and ran out, and sure enough\r\nthey saw the wonderful big coon up in a fork of the tree. It was a\r\nbright moonlight night, but to make doubly sure they cut down the\r\ntree and the dogs ran in--the coon wasn't there.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but, Uncle Remus,\" said the little boy, \"I thought you said\r\nyou saw the coon there.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we did, Honey,\" said the old man, \"so we did; but it's very\r\neasy to see what ain't there when you're looking for it.\"\r\n\r\nAnother method of increasing fertility at increased expense deserves\r\nnotice. The vacant public lands are for the most part desert-like,\r\nand their utilization can come about only through irrigation.\r\n\r\nThis land can be made to produce the finest crops in the world; and\r\nthe tremendous volumes of water that flow from the mountains to the\r\nsea, once harnessed and piped or ditched to this land, will\r\ntransform it into beautiful gardens and farms.\r\n\r\nWith the work being done by the United States Government, and that\r\nof the various states, we may look forward in the not distant future\r\nto this land being made habitable to man.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that with the dry, even climate and with an\r\nabundance of water applied as vegetation needs, this now arid waste\r\nis far more productive than the Eastern states, where the crops are\r\nat the mercy of the elements, sometimes having too much moisture and\r\nat other times not having enough.\r\n\r\n\"Irrigation offers control of conditions such as is found nowhere\r\nexcept in greenhouse culture. The farmer in the humid country cannot\r\ncontrol the amount of starch in potatoes, sugar in beets, protein in\r\ncorn, gluten in wheat, except by planting varieties which are\r\nespecially adapted to the production of the desired quality. The\r\nirrigation farmer, on the other hand, can produce this or that\r\ndesirable quality by the control of the moisture supply to the\r\nplant. He can hasten or retard maturity of the plant, produce early\r\ntruck or late truck on the same soil, grow wheat or grow rice as he\r\ndeems advisable.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the irrigated fields of the Vosges, Vaucluse, etc., in France,\r\nsix tons of dry hay becomes the rule, even upon ungrateful soil; and\r\nthis means considerably more than the annual food of one milch cow\r\n(which can be taken as a little less than five tons) grown on each\r\nacre.\"\r\n\r\n\"The irrigated meadows round Milan are another well known example.\r\nNearly 22,000 acres are irrigated there with water derived from the\r\nsewers of the city, and they yield crops of from eight to ten tons\r\nof hay as a rule; occasionally some separate meadows will yield the\r\nfabulous amount--fabulous to-day but no longer fabulous\r\nto-morrow--of eighteen tons of hay per acre; that is, the food of\r\nnearly four cows to the acre, and nine times the yield of good\r\nmeadows in this country.\" (\"Fields, Factories, and Workshops,\" pages\r\n116-117.)\r\n\r\n\"If irrigation pays\"--and no one now questions that--\"the whole\r\nWestern country of rich soil, which asks but a drink now and then,\r\nwill be turned into a Garden of Eden.\" _(Maxwell's Talisman.)_\r\n\r\nAgriculture may be revolutionized with the advent of irrigation.\r\n\r\nA new method of disposing of sewage and at the same time irrigating\r\nthe soil, has come into use recently, and will be found valuable to\r\nthose who are situated so that they can make use of it.\r\n\r\nThe sewage from buildings is drained into a large tank where the\r\nheavier matter can settle to the bottom. When the water rises nearly\r\nto the top of the tank it is siphoned into another tank, and from\r\nthere it is piped about the field.\r\n\r\nThe piping is very simple--ordinary drain tile conveys the water.\r\nBeginning at the highest point of the field to be irrigated, a\r\nsix-inch (or larger) line of tile should be laid along the highest\r\nground with a fall of not over one inch to each ten feet. From this\r\nmain trunk should be branch lines of \"laterals,\" laid from eight to\r\ntwelve feet apart, as they would be laid for draining a field. These\r\nbranch lines may be laid at an angle to the main trunk as may be\r\nmost convenient; all the joints must be covered so as to keep out\r\nthe flirt. The whole system should be laid deep enough in the ground\r\nto be secure from frost; but to be most effective it should not be\r\nover fourteen to sixteen inches below the surface, hence\r\nsub-irrigation cannot be used very successfully in the Northern\r\nstates. In a sandy loam soil with a clay subsoil it works best at\r\nsixteen to twenty-four inches.\r\n\r\nThis is substantially Colonel Waring's method of sewage disposal. To\r\nget the best use of it for plants, the water should be assembled and\r\nkept in the sun for ten to twelve days, then turned into the pipes\r\nuntil the ground is well soaked, and then shut off and not allowed\r\nin the pipes again for ten to fifteen days, according to the weather\r\nand condition of moisture in the soil. The crop should be cultivated\r\nbetween each watering.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Bailey says, \"Evidently in all regions in which crops\r\nwill yield abundantly without irrigation, as in the East, the main\r\nreliance is to be placed on good tillage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most vegetable gardeners in the East do not find it profitable to\r\nirrigate. Now and then a man who has push and the ability to handle\r\na fine crop to advantage, finds it a very profitable undertaking.\"\r\n(\"Principles of Vegetable Gardening,\" page 174.) Bailey, however,\r\nwas not thinking of \"overhead irrigation.\"\r\n\r\nThe late J. M. Smith, Green Bay, Wisconsin, was one of the expert\r\nmarket gardeners of his region. \"The longer I live,\" wrote Mr.\r\nSmith, then in the midst of a serious drought, \"the more firmly am I\r\nconvinced that plenty of manure and then the most complete system of\r\ncultivation make an almost complete protection against ordinary\r\ndroughts.\" (Same, page 330.)\r\n\r\nIf the soil is cultivated carefully and intensively, it will hold\r\nwater within itself and carry a storage reservoir underneath the\r\ngrowing crop. Finely pulverizing and packing the seed bed, makes it\r\nretain the greatest possible percentage of the moisture that falls,\r\njust as a tumbler full of fine sponge or of birdshot will retain\r\nmany times the amount of water that a tumbler full of buckshot will.\r\nThe atmosphere quickly drinks up the moisture from the soil unless\r\nwe Prevent it. This we do by means of a soil \"blanket,\" called a\r\n\"mulch\" This finely pulverized surface largely prevents the\r\nmoisture below from evaporating, and at the same time keeps the\r\nsurface in such condition that it readily absorbs the dew and the\r\nshowers. Water moves in the soil as it does in a lamp wick, by\r\ncapillary attraction; the more deeply and densely the soil is\r\nsaturated with moisture, the more easily the water moves upward,\r\njust as oil \"climbs up\" a wet wick faster than it does a dry one.\r\nOne can illustrate the effect of this fine soil \"mulch\" in\r\npreventing evaporation by placing some powdered sugar on a lump of\r\nloaf sugar and putting the lump sugar in water. The powdered sugar\r\nwill remain dry even when the lump has become so thoroughly\r\nsaturated that it crumbles to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"We have no useless American acres,\" said Secretary Wilson. \"We\r\nshall make them all productive. We have agricultural explorers in\r\nevery far corner of the world; and they are finding crops which have\r\nbecome so acclimated to dry conditions, similar to our own West,\r\nthat we shall in time have plants thriving upon our so-called arid\r\nlands. We shall cover this arid area with plants of various sorts\r\nwhich will yield hundreds of millions of tons of additional forage\r\nand grains for Western flocks and herds. Our farmers will grow these\r\nupon land now considered practically worthless.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way it has been estimated that in the neighborhood of one\r\nhundred million acres of the American desert can be reclaimed to the\r\nmost intensive agriculture. (See a study of the possible additions\r\nto available land in Prof. W. S. Thompson's \"Population, a Study of\r\nMalthusianism\": Col. U, 1915.) Frederick V. Coville, the chief\r\nbotanist of the Department of Agriculture, does not hesitate to say\r\nthat in the strictly arid regions there are many millions of acres,\r\nnow considered worthless for agriculture, which are as certain to be\r\nsettled in small farms as were the lands of Illinois.\r\n\r\nLand that was thought to be absolute desert has been made to yield\r\nheavy crops of grain and forage by this method without irrigation.\r\n\r\nMacaroni wheat will grow with ten inches of rainfall, and yield\r\nfifteen bushels to the acre. This however is less than the average\r\nwheat yield in the United States.\r\n\r\nMuch can be done by dry farming; that is, by plowing the soil very\r\ndeep and cultivating six or eight times a season, thus retaining all\r\nthe moisture for the crops and reducing evaporation to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of acres in different sections of Montana that\r\ngrow good crops without irrigation. In Fergus County, for instance,\r\nthe wonderful yield of 45 bushels of wheat per acre is grown without\r\nirrigation. Heavy crops of grain and vegetables are grown in the\r\nvicinity of Great Falls by the dry farming system.\r\n\r\nThe money and time spent in spraying is also well invested. The New\r\nYork Agricultural Experiment Station began a ten-year experiment in\r\npotato-spraying to determine how much the yield can be increased by\r\nspraying with Pyrox or with Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the gain due to spraying was larger than ever before. Five\r\nsprayings with Bordeaux increased the yield 233 bushels per acre,\r\nwhile three sprayings increased it 191 bushels. The gain was due\r\nchiefly to the prolongation of growth through the prevention of late\r\nblight. The sprayed potatoes contained one ninth more starch and\r\nwere of better quality.\r\n\r\nThe average increase of profit per acre from spraying potatoes was\r\nfigured to be about $22 on each acre. The result was arrived at from\r\nexperiment, two thirds of which was by independent farmers.\r\n(Particulars will be found In Bulletin No. 264, issued by the\r\nDepartment.)\r\n\r\nIn fourteen farmers' business experiments, including 18 acres of\r\npotatoes, the average gain due to spraying was 62-1/2 bushels per\r\nacre, the average total cost of spraying 93 cents per acre; and the\r\naverage net profit, based on the market price of potatoes at digging\r\ntime, $24.86 per acre.\r\n\r\n\"One class of gardeners,\" Burnet Landreth explains, \"may be termed\r\nexperimental farmers, men tired of the humdrum rotation of farm\r\nprocesses and small profits, men looking for a paying\r\ndiversification of their agricultural interests. Their expenses for\r\nappliances are not great, as they have already on hand the usual\r\nstock of farm tools, requiring only one or two seed drills, a small\r\naddition to their cultivating implements, and a few tons of\r\nfertilizers. Their laborers and teams are always on hand for the\r\nworking of moderate areas. In addition to the usual expense of the\r\nfarm, they would not need to have a cash capital of beyond 20 to 25\r\ndollars per acre for the area in truck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Other men, purchasing or renting land, especially for market\r\ngardening, taking only improved land of suitable aspect, soil, and\r\nsituation, and counting in cost of building, appliances, and labor,\r\nwould require a capital of $80 to $100 per acre. For example, a\r\nbeginner in market gardening in South Jersey, on a five-acre patch,\r\nwould need $500 to set up the business, and run it until his\r\nshipments began to return him money. With the purpose of securing\r\ninformation on this interesting point, the writer asked for\r\nestimates from market gardeners in different localities, and the\r\nresult has been that from Florida the reports of the necessary\r\ncapital per acre, in land or its rental (not of labor), fertilizers,\r\ntools, implements, seed and all the appliances, average $95, from\r\nTexas $45, from Illinois $70, from the Norfolk district of Virginia\r\nthe reports vary from $75 to $125, according to location, and from\r\nLong Island, New York, the average of estimates at the east end is\r\n$75, and at the west end $150.\"\r\n\r\nI have before me now one of the roseate advertisements, which we so\r\noften see in the newspapers, telling how fortunes can be made by\r\ninvesting a few dollars in a tropical plantation in Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt gives what are supposed to be startling yields per acre, and yet\r\nthe returns, which must necessarily be taken with considerable\r\nallowance, are only from $580 to $1087 per acre on various\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nThere are market gardeners and nurserymen near New York City who are\r\nmaking their acres produce better returns than this. It is not\r\nnecessary to go off into the tropical wilderness seeking a fortune\r\nwhich is usually a gold brick that some fellow is trying to sell\r\nyou, when as good results can be secured right at home.\r\n\r\nMarket gardeners in and near Philadelphia pay $25 to $50 an acre and\r\nupwards rent for land, and work from five to forty acres. This is as\r\nmuch as similar land in many parts of the country could be bought\r\nfor. But it is not a high rent when they are right at the\r\nmarket--one man makes the round trip in two and one half\r\nhours--manure costs them nothing--for years they have been using the\r\nexcavations from the old style privy wells, which has been hauled to\r\ntheir farm and deposited where they wished it, free. They have\r\nmodern facilities, such as trolley and telephone, and are as much\r\ncity men as any clerk in an office. They clear far higher profits\r\nfrom an acre than the average farmer, raising never less than two,\r\nand often three crops in a season. They employ several men to the\r\nacre, and at certain times many more, working the men in gangs. Only\r\nthe difficulty of getting good help at their prices prevents them\r\nfrom using twice the number.\r\n\r\nHowever, the possibilities of putting capital into land at a profit\r\nare still infinite.\r\n\r\nWhat chiefly attracts the gardener to the great cities is stable\r\nmanure; this is not wanted so much for increasing the richness of\r\nthe soil--one ninth part of the manure used by the French gardeners\r\nwould do for that purpose--but for keeping the soil at a certain\r\ntemperature. Early vegetables pay best, and in order to obtain early\r\nproduce, not only the air, but the soil as well, must be warmed;\r\nthat is done by putting great quantities of properly mixed manure\r\ninto the soil; its fermentation heats it. But with the present\r\ndevelopment of industrial skill, heating the soil could be done more\r\neconomically and more easily by hot-water pipes. Consequently, the\r\nFrench gardeners begin more and more to make use of portable pipes,\r\nor thermosiphons, provisionally established in the cool frames.\r\n\r\nCompetition that stands in with the railroads can be met only by\r\nbeing near the market or having water transportation. Indeed, the\r\nerect of water transportation in getting manure, and in delivering\r\nthe produce from the railroads, appears in the early history of\r\ntrucking. The railroads often crush out boat competition by\r\nabsorbing docks and standing in with the commission men. This could\r\nbe met by such cooperative selling agencies as the flower growers\r\nalready have.\r\n\r\n\"One of the earliest centers for the development of truck farming in\r\nits present sense was along the shores of Chesapeake Bay, where fast\r\nsailing oyster boats were employed for sending the produce to the\r\nneighboring markets of Baltimore and Philadelphia. In a similar way\r\nthe gardeners about New York early began pushing out along Long\r\nIsland, using the waters of the Sound for transporting their\r\nproduce. The trucking region on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan\r\nis another sample of the effect of convenient water transportation\r\nin causing an early development of this industry. The building of\r\nthe Illinois Central railroad opened up a region in southern\r\nIllinois that was supposed to be particularly adapted to fruit\r\ngrowing.\" (\"Development of the Trucking Interests,\" by F. S. Earle,\r\npage 439.)\r\n\r\nIf one goes into the trucking business on so large a scale as to be\r\nable to make deals with the railroads, such as The Standard Oil\r\nCompany has made, of course additional prices could be gotten, owing\r\nto the possibility of putting competitors at a disadvantage. That\r\nbusiness is a large one.\r\n\r\nIn doing business on this scale, much will depend on your ability as\r\na merchant.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless to grow good crops unless they can be sold at a\r\nprofit; yet it is safe to say that ten men grow good truck crops for\r\none who markets them to the best advantage.\"\r\n\r\nThree Acres and Liberty: Ch. XI-XV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHOTBEDS AND GREENHOUSES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether to get an early start on the garden or for raising plants\r\nfor field crops, a hotbed is all but indispensable. In making a\r\nhotbed what we seek to do is to imitate Nature at her best, so get\r\nthe best soil and the sunniest spot you can find.\r\n\r\nIn all hotbeds the underlying principle is the same: They are\r\nright-angled boxes covered with glass panes set in movable frames\r\nand placed over heated excavations. The bed may be of any size or\r\nshape, but the standard one is six feet wide, since the stock glass\r\nframes are usually six feet long by three feet wide. You can have\r\nany length needed to supply your requirements. \"Tomato Culture,\" by\r\nA. J. Root, tells us that the cheapest plan is to get some old\r\nplanks, broken brickbats or stone, and piece together a box-like\r\naffair in proper shape: to provide drainage, the front should be at\r\nleast ten inches above the ground and the rear fourteen inches. A\r\nhotbed knocked together in this way is all right to start with, if\r\nyou cannot do any better, but will last only two or three seasons.\r\nFor a permanent bed, probably the best way is to make cement walls\r\nextending to the bottom of the manure. The bed ought to face south\r\nor southeast and be well protected on the north. It should be banked\r\nall around with earth or straw to keep out the cold, and mats or\r\nshutters should be provided for extra cold weather. The best\r\nmaterial for heating the bed and the most easily obtained, is fresh\r\nhorse manure in which there is a quantity of straw or litter. This\r\nwill give out a slow, moist heat and will not burn out before the\r\ncrops or the plants mature. Get all the manure you need at one time.\r\nPile it in a dry place and let it ferment; every few days work the\r\npile over thoroughly with a dung fork; sometimes two turnings of the\r\nmanure are enough, but it is better to let it stand and heat three\r\nor four times.\r\n\r\n\"You can make a hotbed also on top of the ground without any\r\nexcavation. Spread a layer of manure evenly one foot in depth and\r\nlarge enough to extend around the frame three feet each way. Pack\r\nthis down well, especially around the edge, put on a second and\r\nthird layer until you have a well-trodden and compact bed of manure\r\nat least two and one half feet in depth. Place the frame in the\r\ncenter of this bed and press it down well.\" A two-inch layer of\r\ndecayed leaves, cut straw, or corn fodder, spread over the manure in\r\nthe frame and well packed down, will help to retain the heat.\r\nVentilate the bed every day to allow steam and ammonia fumes to pass\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"The soil inside should be equal parts of garden loam and\r\nwell-rotted barnyard manure. Tramp well the first layer of three\r\ninches. To make it entirely safe for the plant seeds in the hotbed,\r\nadd another layer of the same depth. Use no water with garden loam\r\nand manure if you can possibly help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before sowing any seeds put a thermometer in the bed three inches\r\ndeep in the soil. If it runs over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, do not sow.\r\nIf below 55 degrees it is too cold; you will have to fork it over\r\nand add more manure. If the bed gets too hot, you can ventilate it\r\nwith a sharp stick by thrusting it down into the soil.\"\r\n\r\nAnother way that the old gardeners have to make a hot bed is with\r\nfire. On a large scale this is cheaper, though more complicated than\r\nthe fermentation of manure. In making this kind choose your location\r\nand build the frames as before. \"Cut a trench with a slight taper\r\nfrom the east end of the plot to the end of the hotbed, and on under\r\nthe ground to about four feet beyond the end of the bed. This taper\r\nto the outlet will create a draught and so keep a better fire. Arch\r\nthis over with vitrified tile. The furnace end where the fire is\r\nshould be about six feet away from the bed. When the trenches are\r\ncompleted, cover over with the dirt that was taken out of them. Two\r\nsuch trenches under the frames will make a good hotbed. Anyone can\r\ndo this sort of work.\"\r\n\r\nA hotbed can also be heated by running steam pipes through the\r\nground, but unless you happen to be where exhaust steam could be\r\nused, this method is not economical except for big houses. The care\r\nand expense of a separate steam plant would be too great to pay,\r\nunless for growing winter vegetables for market or flower culture.\r\nIf you go into that on a scale large enough to pay, new problems at\r\nonce demand solution.\r\n\r\nVegetables under glass have kept pace with other crops. Within\r\nfifteen miles of Boston are millions of square feet of glass devoted\r\nto vegetables, chiefly lettuce. There are more than five million\r\nfeet in the United States used for other crops. Ordinarily, under\r\nfavorable conditions, glass devoted to this work will yield an\r\naverage of fifty cents per year per square foot.\r\n\r\nAbout the lowest estimate of cost per sash is five dollars; this\r\namount includes the cost of one fourth of the frame and covers.\r\nThere are usually four sashes to one frame. A well-made mortised\r\nplank frame costs four to six dollars. A sash, unglazed, costs from\r\none to two dollars. Glazing costs seventy-five cents. Mats and\r\nshutters cost from fifty cents to two dollars per sash, depending\r\nupon the material used. Double thick glass pays better in the end as\r\nbeing less liable to breakage. These prices vary greatly, however.\r\n\r\nThe following sample estimate by a gardener is for a market garden\r\nof one acre, in which it is desired to grow a general line of\r\nvegetables. It supposes that half of the acre is to be set with\r\nplants from hotbeds.\r\n\r\nOne eighth acre to early cauliflower and cabbage, about 2000 plants,\r\nif transplanted, would require two 6 X 12 frames, from two hundred\r\nto two hundred and fifty plants being grown under each sash.\r\n\r\nThese frames may be used again for tomato plants for the same area,\r\nusing about 450 plants. This will allow a sash for every 55 plants.\r\n\r\nOne frame should be in use at the same time for eggplants and\r\npeppers, two sashes of each, growing fifty transplanted plants under\r\neach sash.\r\n\r\nTwo frames will be required for cucumbers, melons, and early\r\nsquashes; for extra early lettuce, an estimate of sixty to seventy\r\nheads should be made to a sash. It is assumed that celery and late\r\ncabbages are to be started in seed beds in the open.\r\n\r\nIn the fashionable suburbs of Boston \"one hotbed 3 X 6 feet was used\r\nin which to start the seeds of early vegetables. Plantings were made\r\nin the open ground as soon as the weather permitted, and were\r\ncontinued at intervals throughout the season whenever there was a\r\nvacant spot in the garden. The following varieties of vegetables,\r\nmostly five-and ten-cent packets, were planted: Pole and wax beans,\r\nbeets, kale, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, corn, cucumbers,\r\ncorn salad, endive, eggplant, kohlrabi, lettuce, muskmelon, onions,\r\npeppers, peas, salsify, radish, spinach, squash, tomatoes, turnips,\r\nrutabagas, escarole, chives, shallot, parsley, sweet and Irish\r\npotatoes, and nearly a dozen different kinds of sweet herbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the larger garden, tomatoes followed peas, turnips the wax\r\nbeans, early lettuce for fall use took the place of Refugee beans.\r\nCorn salad succeeded lettuce.\"\r\n\r\n\"The spinach was followed by cabbage, while turnips, beets, carrots,\r\ncelery, and spinach gave a second crop in the plot occupied by\r\nGardus peas and Emperor William beans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Winter radishes came after telephone peas, Paris Golden celery was\r\nplanted in between the hills of Stowell's blanching. The plot of\r\nearly corn was sown to turnips. The hotbed was used during the late\r\nfall and winter to store some of the hardy vegetables, and the\r\nlatter part of October there was placed in it some endive, escarole,\r\nceleriac, and the remaining space was filled up by transplanting\r\nleeks, chives, and parsley.\" (Bailey, \"Principles of Vegetable\r\nGardening,\" page 38.)\r\n\r\n\"If spinach is grown in frames, the sash used for one of the late\r\ncrops above may be used through the following winter.\r\n\r\n\"This, like the last case, makes a total of five frames, the cost,\r\ndepending on make and material, from one to five dollars; twenty\r\nsash and covers, at, say, $2.75, $55; manure at market price,\r\ncalculating at least three or four loads per frame. This is a\r\nliberal estimate of space, and should allow for all ordinary loss of\r\nplants, and for discarding the weak and inferior ones. It supposes\r\nthat most or all of the plants are to be transplanted once or more\r\nin the frames. Many gardeners have less equipment of glass.\" (Same,\r\npages 49-50 )\r\n\r\nGrowing vegetables under glass gives smaller returns than flowers;\r\nas, for instance, a head of lettuce brings much less than a plant of\r\ncarnations, and suffers more from the competition of southern crops.\r\nNevertheless, the greenhouse-grown vegetables have come into\r\nprominence lately because they can be raised in houses that are not\r\ngood enough for flowers. Lettuce and tomatoes are the principal\r\ncrops; some growers raise thousands of dollars' worth each year. The\r\ngreenhouse is also used for forcing plants which are afterwards\r\ntransplanted to the open air. This develops them at a time when they\r\ncould not grow outdoors and gives them such a start that they are\r\nvery early on the market, thereby realizing the highest prices.\r\n\r\n\"Nearness to market is the most important feature in a greenhouse.\r\nIn large cities, manure, which is the chief fertilizer, can be had\r\nin most cases for the hauling. The short haul is an important item,\r\nand, most important of all, the gardener who is near the market can\r\ntake advantage of high prices, if the grower is near enough to the\r\ncity to make two or three trips; in such a fluctuating market as New\r\nYork, it is to his advantage.\"\r\n\r\nSome kind of a greenhouse is necessary, but one large enough to\r\nproduce a living would cost a very large sum. Vegetable raising\r\nunder glass has been made profitable in special localities where\r\nnearly the whole community gives its time to building up the\r\nindustry, but complete success can be attained only by having\r\nabsolute control of all the conditions entering into production, and\r\ngiving assiduous and undivided attention to detail.\r\n\r\nLeonard Barron, in the _Garden Magazine,_ says: \"The best type of\r\ngreenhouse for all-round purposes is unquestionably what is known as\r\nthe even span--that is, a house in which the roof is in the form of\r\nan inverted V, so as to be exposed as much as possible to sunlight,\r\nand having the ridge-pole in the center. All other types of houses\r\nare modifications from the simplest form, and are designed in some\r\nway or other to fit some special requirements. These requirements\r\nmay be: the cultural necessities for some particular crop; a desire\r\nto have the atmospheric conditions inside more or less abnormal at\r\ngiven seasons (as in a forcing house); or an adaptation to some\r\npeculiarity of the situation, as when a greenhouse is built as an\r\nadjunct to other buildings.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is plain common sense that the ideal greenhouse is one in which\r\nthe light is most nearly that which exists outside, and in which the\r\nheat is as evenly distributed. It is practical experience that a\r\nstructure with as few angles and turns m it as possible and with a\r\nminimum of woodwork in its superstructure, best answers these\r\nconditions.... Greenhouse building has developed into a special\r\nindustry, and the modern American greenhouse is the highest type of\r\nconstruction. It is built with as careful calculation to its\r\nsituation and its requirements as is the country dwellinghouse. Such\r\na thing naturally is not cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"The low-priced 'cheap greenhouse' is a makeshift of some sort.\r\nPerhaps its roof is constructed of hotbed sash, a perfectly feasible\r\nmethod of construction, which for ordinary, commonplace gardening\r\nwill answer admirably. Or, its foundation is merely the plain earth.\r\nSuch a building does admirably in the summer time, and even in the\r\nlate spring and early autumn; but woe betide the enthusiastic\r\namateur in winter, who, being possessed of one of these light\r\ngreenhouse structures, has indulged in a few costly, exotic plants.\r\nThey will be frozen, to a certainty! It is economy to pay a fair\r\nprice in the beginning to secure a properly built greenhouse that\r\nwill withstand the trials of winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"If iron frame is used instead of wood there is greater durability,\r\nand the structure being more slender, will admit more light, but the\r\ncost will be increased.\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes very little difference in cost what shape of house is to\r\nbe erected. The cost per lineal foot for an even span is practically\r\nthe same as for a lean-to of the same length and width. In the\r\nlean-to, in order to get the sufficient bench and walk space inside,\r\nit is necessary to carry the roof to a point much higher than in the\r\neven span. The extra framework and material for the roof cost a good\r\ndeal, yet add practically nothing to the efficiency of the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heating of greenhouses is best done by hot water, and in a small\r\nhouse the pipes may well be connected with the heating system used\r\nfor the dwelling, if the greenhouse and the home are within any sort\r\nof reasonable distance from each other. For large houses, or ranges\r\nof several houses together, the independent heating plant is\r\nnecessary. Steam is used for heating by commercial florists, but it\r\nis economical only on a large scale.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a uniform temperature must be maintained in the house, the\r\nfires, where steam is used, need watching continuously during cold\r\nweather, for the moment the water ceases to boil, the pipes cool off\r\nand a considerable time is consumed in starting the heat running\r\nagain. With hot water there is much more latitude in attention, for\r\nthough the fires dwindle' the water which fills the pipes will carry\r\nheat for a long time, and it will circulate until the last degree is\r\nradiated. But a hot-water system costs in the installation about one\r\nfourth more than steam. Very small houses may be successfully heated\r\nby kerosene stoves, which may be placed inside the house. A much\r\nbetter way would be to use oil heaters for an inside water\r\ncirculation, carrying off all products of combustion by means of a\r\nflue. Coal stoves should never be installed inside the house. It has\r\nbeen done successfully by some amateurs, but the danger of coal gas\r\nbeing driven back into the house by a down draft in the chimney is\r\ntoo great a risk. Coal gas and illuminating gas are two virulent\r\npoisons to plants.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the amateur must proceed with great caution in\r\nundertaking intensive cultivation under glass. Build at first the\r\nsimplest and least expensive kind of hotbeds or greenhouses. It\r\ntakes three to five seasons to train even an experienced farmer\r\nalong these special lines. Separate crops require special treatment.\r\nDo not experiment, but follow well-tried procedure. It is\r\ncomparatively easy to farm an acre under glass, but it should be\r\nworked up to, each step being taken only after a solid foundation is\r\nready to build on. Learn by your mistakes. Don't get discouraged by\r\nfailure. By not making the same mistake twice, you will soon learn\r\nby experience just what is essential to production. The more you\r\nlearn about the way nature does things, the more likely you will be\r\nto succeed when you seek to imitate her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nOTHER USES OF LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had intended to write an interesting chapter on the use of a few\r\nacres of land for poultry, and another on raising a vast drove of\r\nrabbits, both from practical men, but a good average man, just such\r\nas this book is written for, sent the following:\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry that I cannot comply with your request to write a\r\nchapter on poultry for your new book. It is true that I am\r\nphysically and mentally capable of performing that feat, and it\r\nwould be possible for me to prepare an essay that might entertain\r\nthe reader, and even make him believe that there is money in\r\ncommercial poultry. I prefer, however, to leave that sort of\r\nromancing to the poultry journals who, by much practice, are adepts\r\nin the art. The fact is, I did not make poultry raising pay, and had\r\nI remained on my chicken ranch, I would have gone broke. I do not\r\nmean to say, however, that there is no money in poultry, but merely\r\nthat I could not get it out. Perhaps others who are better equipped\r\nfor the work can make a success of such an undertaking, but I could\r\nnot. The numerous poultry journals are filled with instructions how\r\nto do it and with letters from people who assert that they have done\r\nwell with poultry; but, really, during the four years that I was in\r\nthe business I cannot recall a single case of success, and, on the\r\nother hand, I learned of failures without end. I had the reputation\r\nof having the best planned and most completely equipped in this part\r\nof Washington, and perhaps in the entire state. My stock was\r\nthoroughbred and healthy, and they seemed to attend to business\r\nstrictly. I devoted about all my waking hours to them, did\r\neverything that seemed necessary that was suggested by my own\r\nsuccess, and yet I could not make it go, am glad I am clear of it,\r\nand have no desire to try it again. I am perfectly willing to admit\r\nmy possible unfitness for the business, but I am also compelled to\r\nadmit that I could not succeed and that no advice of mine could help\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough many, either under exceptional circumstances or because of\r\nexceptional ability, have made a success of wholesale poultry\r\nraising, it seems on reflection that Mr. Wolf's ideas are in the\r\nmain correct.\r\n\r\nThe price of chickens is fixed, like all other prices, by supply and\r\ndemand, and toward the supply every farmer contributes his chickens\r\nand their eggs which cost him practically nothing; at least he\r\ncounts that they cost him nothing.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that if you considerably increase the supply at any\r\nplace, the price will fall, and the farmer, whose chickens and eggs\r\ncost him almost nothing in money, will sell them low enough to\r\ncommand a market and will continue to raise them, however little he\r\ngets for them.\r\n\r\nSo you are against inexhaustible competitors who can neither be\r\ndriven out nor combined with. It is worse than competing with\r\nbankrupt dealers. To make much money you must have at least some\r\nmonopoly, and even a little bit of the earth that is well suited to\r\nyour purpose where there is no unreasonable and unreasoning\r\ncompetition, will give you a chance.\r\n\r\nBut while it is true that the farmer's subsidized hens have a very\r\ndisastrous effect at times upon the market, the fact is that,\r\nnotwithstanding the tariff, we import millions of dozens of eggs\r\nlaid each year by the pauper hens of Canada and often of Denmark.\r\n\r\nAnother fact to be considered is, that it is when eggs are most\r\nplentiful that the farmers depress the market. With their ways of\r\nhandling their poultry, their hens lay only when conditions are most\r\nfavorable, and in the winter when eggs are as high as fifty cents a\r\ndozen in cities, they have no eggs to market. Like the market\r\ngardener, to be timely in market is to succeed. A week may mean an\r\nannihilation of profits.\r\n\r\nIt is a different proposition to raise a few chickens as a side line\r\nas the farmers do.\r\n\r\nA workman at the Connecticut place of one of the experts who has\r\nrevised this book had a bit of land not more than 100 X 200 feet,\r\nand for several years cleared $100 a year by raising eggs and\r\nbroilers, doing the work together with that of a little garden of\r\nsmall fruits before and after working hours The chickens fed largely\r\non green food in summer.\r\n\r\nIn selling your surplus at a profit, the same principles apply as in\r\nraising a surplus to sell at a profit.\r\n\r\nWhile poultry and egg raising does not require that you must be\r\nfirst, it does require that you market your produce at a time when\r\nthe prices are highest.\r\n\r\nYou must hatch at a time which will allow the young hens to begin\r\nlaying as winter approaches; the food must keep up animal heat and\r\nthe house must be warm enough to make the hens comfortable, and the\r\nconditions must be such as to keep them laying.\r\n\r\nAs an experiment, we once raised six pullets. They were hatched in\r\nMay, and in December they began laying. All during the winter they\r\nlaid never less than four and some times six eggs a day, and kept\r\nthis up until spring.\r\n\r\nThey were fed on wheat and corn and plenty of meat scraps and green\r\nfood. They were kept in what was practically a glass house,\r\nreceiving the benefit of the sun during the day, and were protected\r\nfrom the winds. The effect was to bring as near as possible the\r\ncondition of the warm months; these paid very well.\r\n\r\nDucks are less frequently raised than chickens and often realize\r\ngood returns.\r\n\r\nThe popular fallacy that ducks require a stream or pond is gradually\r\npassing away. There was a time when nearly all ducks were raised in\r\nthis way, feeding on fish as the principal diet, but experience has\r\nproved that ducks raised without a stream or pond tend to put on\r\nflesh instead of feathers, and they have not the oily, fishy flavor\r\nof those raised on the water. Nearly all of the successful duck\r\nraisers now use this method.\r\n\r\nThis is bringing the duck more into prominence as an article of\r\nfood; as James Rankin says in \"Duck Culture,\" \"People do not care to\r\neat fish and flesh combined. They would rather eat them separate.\"\r\n\r\nThe white pekins are the popular birds, because they are larger,\r\nhave white meat, and are splendid layers. They lay from 100 to 165\r\neggs in a season and are the easiest to raise. They can do entirely\r\nwithout water; and Rankin tells of selling a flock to a wealthy man,\r\nwho afterwards wrote asking him to take them back, because he had\r\nbought them for an artificial lake in front of his house, so that\r\nhis wife and children could watch them disporting in the water. He\r\ncomplained that they would not go into the water unless he drove\r\nthem in and would remain only so long as he stood over them.\r\n\r\nDucks are easier to raise than any other fowl and are freer from\r\ndisease. They are ready for market when eight weeks old.\r\n\r\nThe industry is assuming large proportions, and ranches are now\r\nraising ducks by the tens of thousands and are finding better\r\nmarkets each year.\r\n\r\nIn starting any poultry business, it is better to begin with\r\ntwenty-five fowls and master details with those, then double the\r\nnumber as fast as they have been made to return profits.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Squab Company, of Hammonton, N. J., says \"it is a\r\nsimple matter for the beginner to figure out on paper net profits of\r\nfour or five dollars per year from each pair of breeders, but we\r\ndoubt if it can be made. It is, however, 'pigeon nature' to lay ten\r\nor eleven times a year, but hardly natural to presume that each and\r\nevery egg will ultimately mean a Jumbo squab in the commission man's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"A loft [that is, a pair] of high-class Homers, properly mated,\r\nshould average six pair of squabs per year. For one year our squabs\r\naveraged us a fraction over 60 cent per pair; say $3.60 has been\r\nthe returns from each pair of breeders. It has cost us 90 cent per\r\npair to feed for twelve months; remember, we buy in large\r\nquantities; it would cost the small breeder $1 a year per pair to\r\nfeed. It would be well to allow 60 cent a pair for labor and\r\nsupplies, such as grit, charcoal, tobacco stems, etc., although the\r\nbird manure, which we find ready sale for at 55 cent. per bushel,\r\nhas covered these incidental expenses for us. The inexperienced\r\nbeginner, with good management and close attention to details,\r\nshould clear $2 a year from each pair of birds, provided he starts\r\nwith well-mated pure Homer stock.\" Pigeons are particular about\r\ntheir mates, and will rather go single than take a disagreeable\r\npartner.\r\n\r\nRaising Belgian hares at one time promised to be a most profitable\r\nindustry. The Belgian hare is a distant relation of the ordinary\r\nrabbit. Its flesh is white, close-grained, and tender, resembling\r\nthe legs of the frog, and has a very savory flavor. It is considered\r\nby many superior to poultry, and the rapidity with which they breed\r\ngave promise of fortunes. The doe brings forth a litter of about\r\neleven every sixty days, and with prices ranging from $1.50 to\r\n$2.50, as they were about the year 1900, with the cost of raising\r\nfrom thirty to forty cents, the reason for this promise is evident.\r\nIn Southern California thousands turned their attention to it, and\r\nsome firms entered the business with equipment to the value of fifty\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary market prices realized for the hares, some went\r\nextensively into breeding fancy stock, and realized from $50 to $250\r\napiece for them.\r\n\r\nThis industry had indications of becoming extensive and enduring,\r\nbut by 1900 so many went into the business that the markets became\r\nglutted and prices fell with disastrous effect.\r\n\r\nWhether it will pay you depends largely on the attitude of your\r\ncustomers toward the hare as a food product.\r\n\r\nBee-keeping offers an interesting and remunerative field of\r\nemployment. More than the average living awaits those only who will\r\nmake a careful and intelligent study of bees and their habits and\r\nwill give them the proper care and attention.\r\n\r\nOne need not be a practical bee-keeper to enter this field. He can\r\npurchase even one hive and, while increasing from this, he can gain\r\nan experience that he could get in no other way.\r\n\r\nHow shall one start bee-keeping?\r\n\r\nGet one hive or a few hives. If you have no room in the yard, put\r\nthem upon the roof. One man in Cincinnati, Ohio, makes his living\r\nfrom bees kept on the roof of his house.\r\n\r\nWm. A. Selzer, a large dealer in bee-keepers' supplies, in\r\nPhiladelphia, established many colonies on the roof of his place\r\nright in the heart of the business district, where it would seem\r\nimpossible for bees to find a living.\r\n\r\nVery little space is required for bee-keeping; hives can be set two\r\nfeet apart in rows, and the rows six to ten feet apart. No pasture\r\nneed be provided for them. There are always fields of flowers to\r\nsupply the nectar.\r\n\r\nWhite clover produces a large yield of nectar of very fine flavor.\r\nThe basswood or linden tree blossom produces a fine nectar which\r\nsome consider better than white clover. Buckwheat also gives a good\r\nyield of nectar, but it is dark in color and brings a lower price\r\nfor that reason. There are other plants which yield large quantities\r\nof nectar, and it would be necessary to know the locality to say\r\nwhat would be the best plants; but as white clover is found almost\r\neverywhere in the northern states, it is safe to say this will be\r\nthe best producer in the spring, and goldenrod, where found, the\r\nbest for the fall supply.\r\n\r\nFrank Benton, in United States Department of Agriculture Bulletin\r\n59, says: \"It may be safely said that any place where farming,\r\ngardening, or fruit raising can be successfully followed is adapted\r\nto the profitable keeping of bees.\"\r\n\r\nThere is always a farmer here and there who keeps a few hives of\r\nbees. These often can be purchased at a very reasonable price, but\r\nunless they are Italian bees and are in improved hives, it would be\r\nbetter to purchase from some dealer. He may sell you a very weak\r\ncolony, but after the first year these ought to be as strong as any.\r\nStart in the spring; when you have your bees, read good literature\r\non the subject. A. I. Root's \"A B C of Bee Culture\" is good for\r\nbeginners; subscribe for the _American Bee Journal,_ of Chicago, or\r\n_Gleanings in Bee Culture,_ Medina, Ohio. They are full of the\r\nlatest ideas on the subject.\r\n\r\nA yield of fifty pounds of honey in a season can be obtained from\r\none hive of bees in almost any locality. In fact, this is often done\r\nwhere bees are kept in built up cities. One hundred pounds would be\r\nconsidered a very small yield by many apiarists, and twice this\r\namount is often gathered in favored localities where up-to-date\r\nmethods are followed.\r\n\r\nOne man can take care of two hundred hives or colonies, as they are\r\ntermed, if he is working for comb honey, and perhaps twice that\r\nnumber if for extracted honey.\r\n\r\nComb honey is stored usually in one-pound boxes set in a super or\r\nsmall box over the main hive body, which is itself a box about\r\nseventeen inches long, eleven inches wide, and ten inches deep into\r\nwhich frames of comb are slid side by side. These combs are\r\naccessible and can be lifted out, exposing to view the inner\r\nworkings of the hive. It is in these combs that the queen lays as\r\nmany as three thousand eggs some days, and in which the young bees\r\nare hatched. They are also used for storing honey for winter use.\r\n\r\nThe extractor has been invented to remove this honey without\r\ndamaging the comb. The economy of this can readily be seen, as ten\r\npounds of honey can be stored while one pound of comb is being\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the bees free to gather honey instead of using a portion\r\nof their force to build comb, as is necessary when comb honey is\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe extractor is a round tin can on a central pivot with a revolving\r\nmechanism. Into this the full combs of honey are placed and are\r\nwhirled around, throwing the honey out into the can by centrifugal\r\nforce. It is then run out at the bottom into bottles or barrels, and\r\nthe empty combs are replaced in the hive for the bees to fill again.\r\n\r\nTwice as many pounds of honey can be produced by this method; but\r\nthe price of extracted honey is much less than that of comb honey.\r\nAdulteration of extracted honey with glucose is becoming so\r\nprevalent that it threatens to ruin this branch of the industry. But\r\nthere will always be a good market for honey sold direct by the\r\nproducer to residents, or even through storekeepers, in medium size\r\ntowns, where customers can be sure that the honey is pure.\r\n\r\nThe average wholesale prices of honey are about fifteen cents a\r\npound for extracted and twenty cents for fancy comb, so if the\r\napiarist with two hundred hives produces the small average of fifty\r\npounds of comb honey and sells it at fifteen cents a pound, he will\r\nreceive $1500 for his season's work. If he goes in for extracted\r\nhoney and produces one hundred pounds per hive, he will receive even\r\nmore. Of course, expenses will have to come out of this.\r\n\r\nThat this has been done over and over again is proved by men who\r\nstarted in with only a few hives and have accumulated considerable\r\nproperty from the business.\r\n\r\nBut no one need expect to do this unless he is willing to give the\r\nbees the attention which they will require. To neglect them once\r\nmeans often a total loss. Most of the work will have to be done\r\nduring the swarming season in May, June, and July. There has been so\r\nmuch written on the subject and so many inventions and improvements\r\nmade in the hives that bee-keeping more than any other branch of\r\nsimilar employment has been reduced to a science, and any one can\r\nthoroughly master it in two or three years. It is because its\r\npossibilities are not generally recognized that so few are now\r\nengaged in it.\r\n\r\nThe fear of stings will always deter many from entering this\r\nbusiness and so check competition from forcing prices down.\r\n\r\nThe price of honey makes it a luxury, and there will be an unlimited\r\nopportunity in the crop as long as the price does not get near the\r\ncost of producing, which is far below the present prices.\r\n\r\nTo use land directly is to open almost infinite opportunities.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Farmers' Bulletin 204, says: \"In the\r\nUnited States the term 'mushroom' refers commercially to but a\r\nsingle species _(Agaricus Campestris)_ of the fleshly fungi, a plant\r\ncommon throughout most of the temperate regions of the world, and\r\none everywhere recognized as edible.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the commercial use of the term \"mushroom\"\r\nrestricts it to a single species. There are about twenty-five common\r\nvarieties of edible fungi in the Northern states.\r\n\r\nThe successful cultivation of mushrooms in America has not been so\r\ngeneral as in most European countries. It is in France and in\r\nEngland that the mushroom industry has been best developed. France\r\nis the home of the industry. Unusual interest has been shown in the\r\nUnited States in the growth of mushrooms within the past few years,\r\nand it is to be hoped and expected that within the next ten years\r\nthe industry will develop to the fullest limit of the market\r\ndemands. The demand will, of course, be stimulated by the increasing\r\npopular appreciation of this product. In some cities and towns there\r\nis already a good market for mushrooms, while in others they may be\r\nsold directly to special customers. This should be borne in mind by\r\nprospective growers.\r\n\r\nWhile many American growers have been successful, a much larger\r\nnumber have failed. In most cases their failures have been due to\r\none or more of the following causes:\r\n\r\n(1) Poor spawn, or spawn which has been killed by improper storage.\r\n\r\n(2) Spawning at a temperature injuriously high.\r\n\r\n(3) Too much water either at the time of spawning or later.\r\n\r\n(4) Unfavorable temperature during the growing period. It is\r\ntherefore important to the prospective grower that careful attention\r\nbe given to the general discussion of conditions which follow.\r\n\r\nMushrooms may be grown in any place where the conditions of\r\ntemperature and moisture are favorable. A shed, cellar, cave, or\r\nvacant space in a greenhouse may be utilized to advantage for this\r\npurpose. The most essential factor, perhaps, is that of temperature.\r\nThe proper temperature ranges from 53 degree to 60 degree F., with\r\nthe best from 55 degree to 58 degree F. It is unsafe to attempt to\r\ngrow mushrooms on a commercial basis, according to our present\r\nknowledge of the subject, in a temperature much less than 50 degree\r\nor greater than 63 degree F.\r\n\r\nAny severe changes of temperature would entirely destroy\r\nthe profits of the mushroom crop. From this it is evident that in\r\nmany places mushrooms may not be grown as a summer crop. With\r\nartificial heat they may be grown almost anywhere throughout the\r\nwinter. Moreover, it is very probable that in this country open-air\r\nculture must be limited to a few sections.\r\n\r\nA second important factor is moisture. The place should not be very\r\ndamp, or constantly dripping with water. Under such conditions\r\nsuccessful commercial work is not possible. A place where it is\r\npossible to maintain a fairly moist condition of the atmosphere, and\r\nhaving such capability for ventilation as will cause at least a\r\ngradual evaporation, is necessary. With too rapid ventilation and\r\nthe consequent necessity of repeated applications of water to the\r\nmushroom bed, no mushroom crop will attain the highest perfection.\r\n\r\nEven a little iron rust in the soil is reported as fatal to the\r\nCampestris, the only fungus so far successfully propagated.\r\n\r\nIf other fungi than the Campestris come up wild, don't throw them\r\naway as worthless. Many are better eating than the one you seek, and\r\nyou can avoid the risk of poisonous ones by learning to recognize\r\nthe dangerous family--send for the Agricultural Department's\r\nBulletin No. 204. Meanwhile, (1) all mushrooms with pink gills, (2)\r\nall coral-like fungi, (3) all that grow on wood, and (4) all\r\npuffballs, are good to eat if they are young and tender--only don't\r\nmistake an unspread Aminita for a puffball.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious person may find other sources of income in the country.\r\nA young hotel porter in Ulster County, New York, bought seventy\r\nacres of mountain woodland four miles from the railroad for two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars, and puts in his winters cutting barrel\r\nhoops, at which he makes two dollars a day. Meanwhile the land is\r\nmaturing timber. That is hard work, but to gather wild mushrooms or\r\nto cut willows, or sweet pine needles to make cushions, or to catch\r\nyoung squirrels for sale, is lighter, if less steady employment.\r\n\r\nAnd with all our uses of land, we must not forget a little corner\r\nfor the hammock and the croquet hoops for the wife and the children.\r\nIn the Province of Quebec, where the land is held in great tracts\r\nunder the Seigniors, I have seen croquet grounds no bigger than a\r\nbed quilt in front of the little one-room cottages.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman knows the importance of such things as that, has meals\r\nout of doors in fine weather, goes on little picnics, and keeps\r\nmadame contented in the country.\r\n\r\nA swing, or a seesaw, and a tether ball (a ball swinging from the\r\ntop of a pole eight feet high) for the children will help to keep\r\nthe family peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFRUITS\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit raising can succeed in either of two ways. Either planting the\r\norchard in some one fruit and specializing thereon, or diversifying\r\nthe operation to cover many varieties. In the first way it is usual\r\nto establish orchards in favorable localities without special regard\r\nto nearness to market; because in these days of refrigerator car\r\nlines the product of an orchard in any part of the country can be\r\nsent to market quickly enough to avoid loss. Where many varieties\r\nare grown, the best site is usually near a large city where the\r\ngrower can market his own product on wagons and get the benefit of\r\nretail prices.\r\n\r\nRemember that it is far more profitable to raise twenty baskets of\r\nfine, well-shaped, clean, handsome apples or peaches or any other\r\nhand-eaten fruit, than to raise a hundred barrels of stuff that is\r\ngood only for the common drier or for the mill or hogpen.\r\n\r\nCare and common sense are the jackscrews to use in raising fine\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nThe apple is the great American fruit for extensive orcharding. The\r\nquestion is whether there is a profit in apple growing. The answer\r\nis, where the conditions are favorable and when the business is well\r\nconducted there is. Under average conditions, with poor business\r\nmanagement, there is little or none.\r\n\r\nAs Professor S. T. Maynard in _Suburban Life_ tells us, \"In a\r\nsuburban garden of one of our Eastern cities are seven Astrachan\r\ntrees, about twenty years old, from which have been sold in a single\r\nseason over one hundred dollars' worth of fruit. A friend near\r\nBoston put three thousand barrels of picked Baldwins into cold\r\nstorage. None of the fancy apples sold for less than three dollars a\r\nbarrel, and the others netted more than two dollars. They were the\r\nproduct of less than forty acres of trees which had been planted\r\nabout twenty-five years. Another fruit grower showed me several\r\nreturns of commission men of five, six, and even seven dollars a\r\nbarrel for fancy Baldwins. At such prices, and under such\r\nconditions, there is a large profit in apple growing.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other side of the picture, however, is the more common one. A\r\nfriend sent fifty barrels of fancy Baldwins to a commission house,\r\nto be shipped to European markets, the returns for which were just\r\nenough to pay for the barrels. The majority of apples grown in the\r\nUnited States are sold to buyers, one buyer in each section, for a\r\ndollar to two dollars for No. 1 quality, and a dollar for No. 2.\r\nWith the cost of barrels at about forty cents, labor for picking,\r\nsorting, and packing, these prices leave little or nothing for the\r\nuse of the land, cost of fertilizers, spraying, thinning, etc., all\r\nof which are necessary for growing fruit of the best quality.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes further says, in substance, that we must make the trees grow\r\nvigorously, whether upon poor or good soil. Growth is the first\r\nrequirement. To do this, we need a strong, deep, moist soil,--good\r\ngrass land well underdrained makes the best. If this is on an\r\nelevation with a northern or western exposure, it will be better\r\nthan a southern or an eastern one. While apple trees will grow on a\r\nthin soil, so much care and fertilizing is required that the crop\r\nwill be of little or no profit upon such land. Lastly, we must\r\nprotect our fruit from insect and fungous pests.\r\n\r\nOn land that is free from stones and not too steep, thorough and\r\nfrequent cultivation will give the quickest and largest returns. On\r\nsuch land, hoed garden or farm crops may be profitable while the\r\ntrees are small, but after five or six years it will generally be\r\nfound best to cultivate it entirely for the growth of trees. Organic\r\nmatter in the form of stable manure or cover crops will be needed,\r\nand must be applied in the fall or very early in the spring to keep\r\nup the supply of humus in the soil.\r\n\r\nStony land that cannot be plowed or cultivated except at a great\r\ncost may be made to grow good crops of fruit.\r\n\r\nWhile the trees are young, the soil should be worked about them for\r\nthe space of a few feet and then the moisture retained by a mulch\r\nsystem, making use of any waste organic matter like straw, leaves,\r\nmeadow hay, brush, and weeds cut before they seed. Most of the first\r\nprize apples at the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo were grown\r\nunder the \"turf-culture\" system.\r\n\r\nUnless you have trees already on your land, it is too long to wait\r\nsix or seven years for a crop. We can graft good fruit on almost any\r\ntree, though the new dwarf trees will bear much sooner, and if we\r\nhave trees we need not even wait for the harvest of our crop, since\r\nthe windfalls will keep us in apple sauce, jellies, and pies, for no\r\napple is too green for apple sauce, not even the ones that the boys\r\ncan't bite.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty in the profitable growth of the apple is the\r\nmarket. Much of the profit in apple growing, whether in the East or\r\nthe West, will depend upon the extent of the business done,\r\nespecially if one is a considerable distance from markets. The above\r\nare the essentials noted by this practical scientist. Next to the\r\napple crop, perhaps the most important fruit crop for shipping is\r\nthe peach. The locality is perhaps the most important consideration\r\nin a peach orchard. In the Eastern and Southern states, and in\r\nConnecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia, and, of\r\nlate years, Georgia, peaches flourish and produce enormous crops. As\r\na general rule, the nearer the orchard is to large bodies of water,\r\nthe more likely one is to get a crop, as the temperature of the\r\nwater prevents a too early budding out in the spring and delays\r\nkilling autumn frosts.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, a sandy, porous soil is best for peaches, but\r\nthey may be raised on clay lands if provided with plenty of humus.\r\n\r\nAnother fruit which is profitable in districts suited to its growth\r\nis the grape. Bulletin No. 153, Cornell Experiment Station, says:\r\n\"Grapes are a dessert fruit. They are not used to a large extent in\r\nthe kitchen (though they might be), so there are few incidental or\r\nsecondary products; that is, they are not dried, canned, made into\r\njellies, and the like, to any extent, that is, in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe grape is peculiarly a sectional product. Central New York has a\r\nlarge area devoted to it. In northern Ohio, a strip along Lake Erie,\r\nand some of its islands, are devoted almost exclusively to grape\r\nvineyards. In districts where grapes are intensively grown, a great\r\npart of the crop is used for wine, and American wine is extensively\r\nsold m our home markets, although it frequently has foreign labels.\r\n\r\nAny one purchasing a farm should plant some grapevines for home use.\r\nGrape juice is easily made and kept and is a pleasing beverage.\r\nGrape jelly is excellent and could be readily marketed in any nearby\r\ntown, since there is very little, comparatively, on sale. A grape\r\narbor gives shade, needs little care, and can be planted near the\r\nhouse where it will not interfere with the crops. For you cannot\r\ncultivate all of your land; some grassy space must be left around\r\nthe house if only for drying clothes. But if ground is scarce, vines\r\nor lima beans can be trained up the back porch or up the sunny side\r\nof the house; or a few climbing nasturtiums will give decorations\r\nwithout care, while the young leaves make a good salad.\r\n\r\nOf home orchard fruits, the plum, pear, and quince are all\r\nprofitable specialties, especially for intensive acre raising. In\r\ngeneral, the same remark may be made of them as of the other fruits,\r\nthat they need careful selection of land to get the best results.\r\nThe cherry has recently come to be recognized as a good commercial\r\nspecialty. Mr. George T. Powell, in _The American Agriculturist,_\r\nsays: \"The crop is a precarious one to market.... The risk and loss\r\nmay be largely reduced by making a proper selection of site for the\r\norchard. This should be on high ground where the air generally\r\ncirculates freely. This is especially necessary for sweet varieties.\r\nThe soil should be rich, with naturally good drainage.\"\r\n\r\nHe says: \"I have had Rockport trees produce four hundred pounds each\r\nand the fruit net ten cents a pound for the entire crop. The English\r\nMorello trees may be grown fifteen feet apart each way, which will\r\nallow two hundred trees to the acre. The larger trees ought to be\r\nplanted somewhat thinner.... Cherries are packed largely in\r\neight-pound baskets and in strawberry quarts. Each basket is filled\r\nwith carefully assorted fruit, every imperfect specimen being taken\r\nout, after which they are faced by placing the stems downward so\r\nthat the cherry shows in regular rows upon the face. Girls and women\r\ndo this work. The Eastern fruit grower must bear in mind that he has\r\nto meet in his market the competition of the Pacific coast growers,\r\nwho excel in fine packing; and although our Eastern grown cherries\r\nare of a finer flavor, they are sent to the market in such a crude\r\nmanner and in such unattractive condition that they sell for much\r\nless than the California fruit.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding bush berries, he says, you will get a small crop the\r\nsecond year after planting and for the third and subsequent years a\r\nfull crop. The important thing is to keep the dead canes well pruned\r\nout, as the cane borer is one of the worst insect pests. When they\r\nappear they can be stopped by cutting off the shoot several inches\r\nbelow the puncture as soon as it begins to droop, and burning the\r\npart cut off. Again, Mr. Powell says, \"Currants require rich soil.\r\nA clay or heavy loam is better than a heavy dry soil. They should be\r\nplanted in the fall. The average from ten thousand bushes should be\r\nabout four quarts each. The cherry currant is perhaps the largest in\r\nsize, but not so prolific as some others. Currants are shipped and\r\nsold in thirty-two quart crates and have to be carefully packed to\r\nget to market in good condition.\"\r\n\r\nGooseberries are raised by the acre. Mr. A. M. Brown, Kent County,\r\nDelaware, in _The American Agriculturist,_ tells of a plantation in\r\nCentral Delaware where over twenty four thousand pounds were\r\ngathered from a scant four acres. The product was sold to the\r\nBaltimore canners for six cents a pound, making $1440 in all. In\r\naddition to the gooseberries grown on six acres, a large crop each\r\nof apples and pears were grown on the same ground. Like currants,\r\nthe gooseberry must be sprayed to destroy the worms, and cut back\r\nand burnt to destroy the cane borer.\r\n\r\nThere is little special knowledge required, however, in raising this\r\nfruit, and it is well adapted for growers with small acreage and\r\nlittle money.\r\n\r\nIn going into the cultivation of bush fruits, it is usually best to\r\ngrow them in great variety near the market where they are to be\r\nsold. The bush fruits are then uniformly profitable. In _Suburban\r\nLife_ Mr. E. C. Powell tells us that the spring is the best time for\r\nplanting raspberries and blackberries, just as soon as the ground is\r\ndry enough to work. The first season the plots should be well\r\ntilled. It is possible to grow vegetables between the rows the first\r\nyear before the berries begin to bear, but unless pressed for space,\r\nit probably doesn't pay.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best of small fruits, however, and most largely used is\r\nthe strawberry. The strawberry can be planted by the acre. The\r\nground must be rich loam and plenty of humus, well drained, with a\r\nsouthern exposure. Well-grown plants set out in the open will bear a\r\nsmall crop the first season, but will not become of maximum bearing\r\ntill the second year. After the crop is taken off in the fall a\r\nmulch of straw or leaves should be placed over the plants to protect\r\nthem during the winter. The strawberries are picked by boys and\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nThe strawberry is an exceedingly profitable crop if properly\r\nhandled, and is one of the best small fruits for people with little\r\ncapital. While the price in the general market varies from fifteen\r\nto thirty cents per quart, they sometimes run as high as fifty in\r\nthe early spring; yet it is possible to grow strawberries worth six\r\ndollars a quart by intensive culture in greenhouses. Mr. S. W.\r\nFletcher, in _Country Life in America,_ says: \"The forcing of\r\nstrawberries is a specialized industry of the highest type.\r\nEverybody cannot make it pay everywhere.... Strawberries are forced\r\nin pots or in benches. The pot method is preferred by those who find\r\na demand for the highest quality of fruit regardless of expense....\r\nIf fruit is desired for Christmas, the plants are not checked to any\r\nextent, but are kept in continuous growth. The conditions of\r\nspringtime are simulated as far as possible. At Christmas time a\r\nquart box of forced Marshall strawberries sells at from one-fifty to\r\neight dollars per quart, averaging about four dollars.\"\r\n\r\nOur most valuable allies against the insect armies are toads, bats,\r\nwasps, dragon flies, and birds; they enjoy the battle.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be too many toads or bats. Toads will eat all sorts of\r\nflies, potato bugs, squash bugs, rose bugs, caterpillars, and almost\r\nanything that crawls.\r\n\r\nIf the wasps become a nuisance, it is easy to poison them; but the\r\nbirds are often a nuisance--the robins eat the strawberries and\r\ncherries the instant they are ripe. They soon get used to\r\nscarecrows; and to cover the fruit with nets gives the insects a\r\nfree hand. Some growers raise sweet cherries or other fruits\r\nspecially to feed up the birds so that they will let the rest alone.\r\nEarly rising and a plenty of cats is about the best remedy. A man,\r\nor even a woman, working on the land is the best scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other fruits that grow wild in certain sections and\r\nare gathered and sent to market. Among these the cranberry is the\r\nmost important. It grows in nearly inaccessible bogs, principally in\r\nNew Jersey, and the usual custom is for owners of land on which\r\nthere are cranberry bogs to let out the bog to pickers on a\r\npercentage basis. Cranberries can be cultivated, and there is a\r\nconsiderable profit in the business. The swampy nature of the ground\r\nneeded, however, will deter all except the most persistent from this\r\nindustry. Some cranberry bogs bring as high as a thousand dollars an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nThe blueberry or huckleberry, or, as we call it in Ireland, the\r\nbilberry, or frohen, grows wild in the northerly states, and is much\r\nsought after in the market. Many efforts have been made to grow the\r\nblueberry commercially; but, as is well said by Mr. J. H. Hale in\r\nthe _Rural New Yorker,_ \"The blueberry proved to be a good deal like\r\nIndians--it would not stand civilization, and was never\r\nsatisfactory, although I monkeyed with it for a period of about ten\r\nyears.\" Mr. Fred W. Card, of Rhode Island, in the same issue reports\r\na similar experience. With our present knowledge of the blueberry,\r\nit is doubtful if it can be made a commercially cultivated crop.\r\nLately, however, it is claimed that it can be grown in very poor,\r\nnon-nitrogenous soil.\r\n\r\nA variety, however, called the Garden Blueberry, gives almost\r\nincredible yields, five bushels being reported from sixty plants. It\r\nkeeps all winter _on the branches,_ if stored in a cellar, and is of\r\nfine flavor and especially good for preserves. A little frost\r\nimproves it.\r\n\r\nBut wild berries, crab apples, and elderberries and others, are good\r\nto preserve and find a ready sale if attractively put up; they also\r\nhelp out the table greatly. Then think of the fun!\r\n\r\nIn recent years, certain varieties of nuts, like the English walnut,\r\nthe pecan, and the hickory nuts have been grown commercially. In the\r\nSouth particularly, the pecan has been found a good crop to plant on\r\ncotton plantations which have been overworked. In the _Rural New\r\nYorker,_ Mr. H. E. Vandevan gives an account of an old cotton\r\nplantation of 2250 acres Iying on the west bank of the Mississippi\r\nRiver in Louisiana. The pecan tree was indigenous to the land, and\r\nthe wooded portion of the plantation has thousands of giant pecan\r\ntrees growing on it. The previous owners of this plantation had done\r\nall in their power to destroy these trees, but they flourished in\r\nspite of that. Mr. Vandevan, however, saw in the pecan a large\r\nprofit, and he has planted ten thousand trees on six hundred acres,\r\nall in a solid block. The trees are set fifty feet apart both ways,\r\nexcept where a roadway is left. Between the pecan trees Mr. Vandevan\r\nhas planted fig trees for early returns, with the intention of\r\ncanning the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is grown principally in California. Its value has\r\nbeen recognized only recently, as all of the nut crops take a good\r\nmany years before the trees begin to bear. Nut growing on a small\r\nscale is not of much value to a man with a little bit of land,\r\nexcept as an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nIf you find a sweet chestnut tree or a shell-bark hickory or two in\r\nyour wood lot, they will well repay protection and careful\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nIf you don't, why--there are great promises in quick maturing nut\r\ntrees. There is now an English walnut which is claimed to bear the\r\nthird or even the second year after setting out. My own small\r\nexperience with these in New Jersey, however, has not been a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFLOWERS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery city in the United States affords an opportunity for flower\r\ngardening and nurseries, but a study must be made of the market in\r\norder to know what is best to raise and where to raise it.\r\n\r\nThe choice of crops depends on the popular taste. The flowers which\r\nare now in greatest demand are the rose, carnation, violet, and\r\nchrysanthemum.\r\n\r\nNear every large city there are hundreds of florists with glass\r\nhouses, some covering twenty acres or more. There were over 2000\r\nacres of flower land under glass reported at the last census. As\r\nalmost all industries to-day are specialized, so is floriculture; in\r\none place we see ten acres of glass given over to the rose, in\r\nanother thousands of dollars devoted to the carnation or the violet,\r\nwhile one grower in Queens, Long Island, has 75,000 square feet of\r\nglass for carnations.\r\n\r\nThe specialist who devotes his thoughts and energies to raising one\r\nflower can produce better results than if he raised a variety. He\r\nhas only one crop to market, and can do it more successfully than\r\nwith a number of crops. If he raises enough to make himself a factor\r\nin the market, he can sell direct instead of sending his product to\r\na commission man, thereby receiving better prices.\r\n\r\nLittle capital is required to start; intelligent effort is the road\r\nto success. Very few, indeed, who are now leaders in floriculture,\r\nstarted with more than $500 capital, and many with much less. One of\r\nthe largest growers of roses in the United States, whose plant\r\ncovers more than ten acres, did not have $500 when he started, and\r\nmany others not so well known are making handsome livings and have\r\naccumulated thousands of dollars of property from a start of less\r\nthan $500.\r\n\r\nBut practical knowledge is much more necessary than in raising\r\nvegetables, as small mistakes will have more serious results.\r\nTherefore, if you have some capital and wish to go into flower\r\nraising, it will pay you, if circumstances permit, to hire out to a\r\nflorist, even at small wages, till you have learned the\r\nbusiness--even though you have raised flowers successfully in a home\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nMr. Frank Hamilton, manager of C. W. Ward's of Queens, tells of at\r\nleast a dozen men, who have been in their employ during his\r\ntwenty-five years' experience, some of whom got only twenty dollars\r\na month at first, and afterwards started in a small way for\r\nthemselves, who are now making a substantial living.\r\n\r\nAlthough the market depends largely on the wealthy class in the\r\nlarge cities, many florists devote considerable time and space to\r\nflowers which are bought by the poorer class of city dwellers who\r\nhave no space or time to raise their own.\r\n\r\nThere are always good markets somewhere for the crop, and it is not\r\nan uncommon thing to ship flowers from New York to Chicago, Buffalo,\r\nBoston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, or vice versa. The\r\nchances of success for a lover of flowers are better in this\r\nbusiness than in any in which one with a like amount of capital can\r\nengage. If the business at first is not large enough to use all his\r\ntime he will find no trouble in securing employment in his immediate\r\nvicinity. There are always some who want such a person to care for\r\ntheir lawns or to give some time to their conservatories.\r\n\r\nIn the last ten years the business has doubled, and while many have\r\ngone into it, the profit they are making indicates that supply has\r\nnot kept pace with demand, and that it is not likely to be overdone\r\nthe near future.\r\n\r\nProfessor B. T. Galloway, in an article in _The World's Work,_ says,\r\n\"An acre of soil under glass pays fifty times as much as an acre\r\noutdoors. There are annually sold in this country six to seven\r\nmillion dollars' worth of carnation flowers There are no less than\r\neight to ten million square feet of glass in the United States\r\ndevoted to this flower alone.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Rockefeller's place at Tarrytown is the largest\r\ncompetitor in the New York market for violets, there is no local\r\nmonopoly in that, and the local producer with personal attention can\r\ndo well.\r\n\r\nIn the _Country Gentleman_ an account is given of a violet farm on\r\nthe north shore of Illinois, where two women are supplying local\r\nflorists.. One of them says: \"We started our farm last spring in the\r\nface of most discouraging prophecies from our friends and the\r\nkeenest competition of violet growers of New York. But we believed\r\nwe could be successful. We had studied the best scientific methods\r\nof growing the plants, had imported the best soil obtainable, and\r\nbuilt a greenhouse fully adapted to our needs, so we just went ahead\r\nand we found it to be a paying proposition.\r\n\r\n\"Our first experiment was in using cuttings from the violet farm of\r\na lady at Lansing, Michigan, who has been a most successful grower.\r\nThese did not thrive, and we next imported 3000 cuttings from the\r\nTarrytown neighborhood, where violet culture has been most\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\"The first rule is to keep the temperature of the greenhouse between\r\nforty-five and fifty degrees. Violets are spring flowers, and wither\r\nand droop if the temperature is not at the right degree. Most people\r\nthink the double violets have no fragrance because most of those\r\nthat we get lose their fragrance in transit.\r\n\r\n\"We supply 2000 flowers a week, and as they reach our patrons within\r\ntwo or three hours at the most from the time of cutting, they retain\r\ntheir fragrance. They are also larger and of a deeper color than the\r\nNew York flowers. Next year we hope to go in on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\n\"While the work is not hard, it requires infinite care and vigilance\r\nwhen the little plants are growing. As a career for a woman, violet\r\ngrowing offers greater inducements than anything I can think of.\"\r\n\r\nThen, surely, others can succeed in other flowers at other places.\r\nWhile there is little choice between the standard styles of\r\ngreenhouses for violets, there should be abundant provision for\r\nsupplying fresh air, either from the sides or top, whichever is\r\nchosen. The system of ventilation should admit of operation either\r\nfrom the inside or the outside of the house, as fumigation with\r\nhydrocyanic acid gas is sometimes necessary, in the fumes of which\r\nit is impossible to enter, unless with a gas mask.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the house should secure the greatest possible\r\nsupply of sunshine in December and January, and the least possible\r\nduring the growing season, when, as Miss Howard points out, it is\r\nnecessary to secure as low a temperature as possible, so as to\r\nobtain good, vigorous, healthy-growing plants. The best site is a\r\nlevel piece of ground, or one sloping gently to the south.\r\n\r\nOf the diseases to which cultivated violets are subject Mr. P. H.\r\nDorsett, of the Department of Agriculture, names four as especially\r\ndangerous: Spot disease, producing whitish spots on the foliage;\r\nroot rot, apt to attack young plants transplanted in hot, dry\r\nweather; wet rot, a fungus apt to appear in too moist air or where\r\nventilation is insufficient; and yellowing, of the cause of which\r\nlittle is known. Any of these diseases is difficult to exterminate\r\nwhen it once gains a foothold. The best thing to do is to get\r\nstrong, vigorous cuttings, and then to give careful attention to\r\nwatering, cultivation, and ventilation, and the destruction of dead\r\nand dying leaves and all runners as fast as they appear.\r\n\r\nAmong insect enemies, the aphids, red spiders, eel worms, gall\r\nflies, and slugs may be mentioned. Most of these can be easiest\r\ncontrolled by hydrocyanic acid gas treatment.\r\n\r\nChrysanthemums, especially of preternatural size and bizarre\r\ncolors--the college colors at football games, for instance--are in\r\ngreat demand. They are extremely decorative, and their remarkable\r\nlasting quality insures their permanent popularity. I have heard\r\nthat the unexpanded bud can be cooked like cauliflower for the\r\ntable; but we have not learned to use them in that way. In Japan and\r\nChina the leaves of the chrysanthemum are esteemed as a salad. One\r\nattempt has been made by English gardeners to introduce this use of\r\nthem into England, but it was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe annual shows of chrysanthemums and of roses indicate the\r\nimportance of the business.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known, but the poppies are coming into favor for\r\ncut flowers in spite of the fact that they do not keep very well.\r\nMiss Edith Granger avoids this difficulty, as she explains in the\r\n_Garden Magazine,_ \"by picking off all blooms that have not already\r\nlost their petals in the evening, so that in the morning all the\r\nopen flowers will be new ones. These are cut as early as possible,\r\neven while the dew is still upon them, and plunged immediately into\r\ndeep water.\"\r\n\r\nYou need not be discouraged by the low prices at which flowers,\r\nespecially violets and roses, are often offered in the streets.\r\nThose flowers are the discarded stock or delayed shipments of the\r\nswell florists. You will find that those flowers are fading, or\r\nrevived with salt, and will not keep.\r\n\r\nThat they are so peddled, shows that everybody, at hotels, dinners,\r\nfunerals, weddings, in the home, and the young men for the young\r\nwomen, want flowers, the loveliest things ever made without souls.\r\nWe have only to supply such a want to find our place in life.\r\n\r\nAs a side line the common flowers will bring good prices;\r\nmignonette, bachelor buttons, cosmos, and even nasturtiums, which\r\nyou can't keep from growing if you just stick the seed in the\r\nground, or lilies of the valley, which you can hardly get rid of\r\nonce they start, never go begging, if they are fresh.\r\n\r\nA favorite flower with many is the sweet pea, which can be grown out\r\nof doors in the summer time where you have a good depth and quality\r\nof soil.\r\n\r\nI have seen May blossoms and autumn leaves on the branch and even\r\ngoldenrod brought into town and sold at good prices.\r\n\r\nEnterprises often look attractive at a distance; for instance,\r\nraising orchids, especially as some of the flowers remain on the\r\nplants ready for market for weeks and bring high prices. But to ship\r\nflowers at a profit they must be in quantities, else the expenses\r\neat up the returns, and they must be shipped with considerable\r\nregularity, else you lose your customers. To get such a supply of\r\norchids would take a very large capital and involve so much labor\r\nthat it is doubtful if more than good interest could be realized on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMany florists make money by keeping constantly on hand ferns, palms,\r\nand other plants like rubber trees, which they rent out for social\r\nfunctions, weddings, and other occasions. Most florists in the\r\nlarger cities have also quite a thriving business in tree planting,\r\nwhich is everywhere on the increase. A highly specialized department\r\nof horticulture is that of raising young trees and plants to sell\r\nfor improving grounds, planting orchards, or similar uses. The\r\nnursery business bears much the same relation to the commercial\r\nflorist or orchardist as seed growing does to the market gardener.\r\n\r\nCertain communities, through favorable soil or climate, are best\r\nadapted to the production of nursery stock. Consequently, one finds\r\nthis industry most highly developed in scattered localities. It is\r\ntrue that people with small capital should not tackle a business so\r\ntechnical as this.\r\n\r\nThe business of bulb production is another highly specialized\r\ndepartment. In certain sections of Holland large areas of the rich\r\nlowlands are given over to bulbs of various kinds of lilies, nearly\r\nall of which are propagated in that manner. To attain perfection, at\r\nleast in the North, most bulbs require deep, rich, warm, and highly\r\nmanured soils; and assiduous attention at every stage. In many plant\r\nspecialties, the gardeners of Europe still far surpass our own,\r\nbecause conditions there have forced them to make use of every\r\navailable means to increase production. The immense price that\r\nEuropean gardeners have to pay for land has been a most potent\r\nfactor in forcing them to seek out and apply the most ingenious\r\nforcing methods. The time is upon us here in America also when we\r\nmust find out the highest use of land and apply it to that use.\r\n\r\nAs the aesthetic qualities of our people become more highly\r\ndeveloped, the business of raising flowers must become of increasing\r\nimportance, and will readily reward any one who goes into it\r\nconscientiously. Flower growing is peculiarly adapted to women,\r\nsince the work is light There are few disagreeable features, unless\r\nit be the handling of the manure incidental to the best results.\r\n\r\nStill, the enjoyments of agriculture depend upon individual tastes.\r\nI have seen \"lady gardeners\" picking strawberries with the footman\r\nholding up an umbrella to screen them from the sun.\r\n\r\nSome women would like that, some not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDRUG PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nA source of profit from land to which little attention has been\r\ngiven in the United States is collecting or raising plants, some\r\npart of which may be used for medicinal purposes. We condense from\r\nFarmers' Bulletin No. 188, United States Department of Agriculture:\r\n\r\nCertain well-known weeds are sources of crude drugs at present\r\nobtained wholly or in part from abroad. Roots, leaves, and flowers\r\nof several of the species most detrimental in the United States are\r\ngathered, cured, and used in Europe, and supply much of the demands\r\nof foreign lands. Some of these plants are in many states subject to\r\nanti-weed laws, and farmers are required to take measures toward\r\ntheir extermination.\r\n\r\nThe prices paid for crude drugs from these sources save in war time\r\nare not great and would rarely tempt any one to this work as a\r\nbusiness. Yet if in ridding the farm of weeds and thus raising the\r\nvalue of the land the farmer can at the same time make these pests\r\nthe source of a small income instead of a dead loss, something is\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nOne rather alluring fact contained in an article by Dr. True, is\r\nthat a shortage has become keenly felt in \"Golden Seal,\" which the\r\nearly American settlers learned from the Indians to use as a\r\ncurative for sore and inflamed eyes, as well as for sore mouth. The\r\nplant grows in patches in high open woods, and was formerly found in\r\ngreat abundance in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia, but\r\nis now so rare that its price has risen from thirty-five cents\r\nwholesale in 1898 to over seventy-five cents a pound. Persons in\r\ndifferent parts of the country have undertaken the production of\r\nGolden Seal on a commercial scale. More than six hundred dollars'\r\nworth can be grown on an acre: so a crop this year would be a\r\nfortune. The methods of raising it can be ascertained upon\r\napplication to the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nGinseng is one of the drug crops which paid handsome returns a few\r\nyears ago, perhaps because it takes from five to seven years to grow\r\nfrom seeds; but so many went into that line that few men to-day make\r\nanything at it. Furthermore, the Chinese, who use a large part of\r\nit, will buy only the wild roots--and they know the difference.\r\nThose who control the trade have burned quantities in the effort to\r\nkeep up the price.\r\n\r\nThere are some drug plants which might be raised with success by\r\nthose who would specialize in one plant, but the lesson we learn\r\nfrom ginseng should act as a warning.\r\n\r\nRaising drugs is one of those things that seems to be more\r\nprofitable to teach others to do than to do yourself. A well known\r\nProfessor said to me: \"If I were twenty-five and knew what I know\r\nabout drugs and the market for them, I should go into the\r\ndrug-raising business. But I should expect to lose money for some\r\nyears. If I were a small clerk, say, or an old man who wanted to get\r\nout of city life, and I had $500 I really wanted to venture in drug\r\nraising, I should divide it in half--half I should put in the bank\r\nand the other half I should throw into the Hudson River. Then I\r\nshould be sure of $250 instead of being drawn on to spend it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of the people who have been in the business, notably the\r\nShakers, who used to do the most of it, are gradually getting out of\r\nit. The few men who make money raising drugs keep it to themselves.\"\r\n\r\nIn many cases when weeds have been dug the work of handling and\r\ncuring them is not excessive and can readily be done by women and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nToo much emphasis cannot be placed upon the importance of carefully\r\nand thoroughly drying all crude drugs, whether roots, herbs, leaves,\r\nbarks, flowers, or seeds, and putting them under cover at nightfall.\r\nIf poorly dried, they will heat and become moldy in shipping, and\r\nthe collector will find his goods rejected by the dealer and have\r\nall his trouble for nothing. Leaves, herbs, and flowers should never\r\nbe washed.\r\n\r\nIt is important also to collect in proper season only, as drugs\r\ncollected out of season are unmarketable on account of inferior\r\nmedicinal qualities, and there will also be a greater shrinkage in a\r\nroot dug during the growing season than when it is collected after\r\ngrowth has ceased.\r\n\r\nThe roots of annual plants should be dug in the autumn of the first\r\nyear just before the flowering period, and those of biennial and\r\nperennial plants in the fall of the second or third year, after the\r\ntops have dried.\r\n\r\nAfter the roots have been dug the soil should be well shaken from\r\nthem, and all foreign particles, such as dirt, roots, and parts of\r\nother plants, should be removed. If the roots cannot be sufficiently\r\ncleared of soil by shaking, they should be thoroughly washed in\r\nclean water. Drugs must look wholesome at least. It does not pay to\r\nbe careless in this matter. The soil increases the weight of the\r\nroots, but the purchaser is not willing to pay by weight for dirt,\r\nand grades the uncleaned or mixed drugs accordingly. It is the\r\nbright, natural looking root, leaf, or plant that will bring a good\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nAfter washing, the roots should be carefully dried by exposing them\r\nto light and air, on racks or shelves, or on clean well-ventilated\r\nbarn floors, or lofts. They should be spread out thinly and turned\r\noccasionally from day to day until completely cured. When this point\r\nis reached, in perhaps three to six weeks, the roots will snap\r\nreadily when bent. If dried out of doors they should be placed under\r\nshelter at night and upon the approach of rain.\r\n\r\nSome roots require slicing and removing fibrous rootless. In\r\ngeneral, large roots should be split or sliced when green in order\r\nto facilitate drying.\r\n\r\nBarks of trees should be gathered in spring, when the sap begins to\r\nflow, but may also be peeled in winter. In the case of the coarser\r\nbarks (as elm, hemlock, poplar, oak, pine, and wild cherry) the\r\nouter layer is shaved off before the bark is removed from the tree,\r\nwhich process is known as \"rossing.\" Only the inner bark of these\r\ntrees is used medicinally. Barks may also be cured by exposure to\r\nsunlight, but moisture must be avoided.\r\n\r\nLeaves and herbs should be collected when the plants are in full\r\nflower. The whole plant may be cut and the leaves may be stripped\r\nfrom it, rejecting the coarse and large stems as much as possible,\r\nand keeping only the flowering tops and more tender stems and\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nBoth leaves and herbs should be spread out in thin layers on clean\r\nfloors, racks, or shelves, in the shade, but where there is free\r\ncirculation of air, and turned frequently until thoroughly dry.\r\nMoisture will darken them.\r\n\r\nFlowers are collected when they first open or immediately after, not\r\nwhen they are beginning to fade. Seeds should be gathered just as\r\nthey are ripening, before the seed pods open, and should be winnowed\r\nin order to remove fragments of stems, leaves, and shriveled\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nThe collector should be sure that the plant is the right one. Many\r\nplants closely resemble one another, and some \"yarbs,\" contrary to\r\nthe popular impression, are deadly poison--nightshade (belladonna)\r\nand the wild variety of parsnips, for instance. Therefore, where any\r\ndoubt exists, send a specimen of the entire plant, including leaves,\r\nflowers, and fruits, to a drug dealer or to the nearest state\r\nexperiment station for identification.\r\n\r\nSamples representative of the lot of drugs to be sold should be sent\r\nto the nearest commission merchant, or drug store, for inspection\r\nand for quotation on the amount of drug that can be furnished, or\r\nfor information as to where to send the article.\r\n\r\nIn writing to the different dealers for information and for prices,\r\nwhich vary greatly, it should be stated how much of a particular\r\ndrug can be furnished and how soon this can be supplied, and postage\r\nshould always be inclosed for reply. The collector should bear in\r\nmind that freight is an important item, and it is best, therefore,\r\nto address the dealers accessible to the place of production. The\r\npackage containing the sample should be plainly marked with contents\r\nand the name and address of the sender. When ready for shipment\r\ncrude drugs may be tightly packed in burlap or gunny sacks, or in\r\ndry, clean barrels.\r\n\r\nBurdock root brings from three to eight cents per pound, and seed\r\nfive to ten cents. About fifty thousand pounds of the root is\r\nimported annually, and the best has come from Belgium. Of dock\r\nroots, about 125,000 pounds are imported annually, at from two to\r\neight cents.\r\n\r\nThe field for the sale of dandelion root is large.\r\n\r\nOf couch grass, the roots of which cause much profanity in this\r\ncountry, there are some 250,000 pounds annually imported at from\r\nthree to seven cents per pound.\r\n\r\nA common weed with which there is a considerable trouble is the\r\npokeweed, the root of which brings from two to five cents per pound\r\nand the dried berries five cents per pound.\r\n\r\nForty to sixty thousand pounds of foxglove are imported from Europe.\r\nAnalysis has shown that the leaves of the wild American foxglove are\r\nas good as the European article, the price of which per pound ranges\r\nfrom six to eight cents.\r\n\r\nOf mullein flowers about five thousand pounds used to be imported,\r\nchiefly from Germany. The leaves are also imported.\r\n\r\nDried leaves and tops of lobelia bring from three to eight cents per\r\npound, while the seed commands fifteen to twenty cents per pound.\r\n\r\nOf tansy about thirty-five thousand pounds have been imported\r\nannually at a price rallying from three to six cents.\r\n\r\nThe flowering tops and leaves of the gum plant are used as drug.\r\nThey bring from five to twelve cents per pound.\r\n\r\nBoneset leaves and tops bring from two to eight cents per pound.\r\nCatnip tops and leaves two to eight cents per pound.\r\n\r\nOf horehound about 125,000 pounds are imported annually, prices\r\nbeing three to eight cents per pound.\r\n\r\nBlessed thistle is cultivated in Germany, and it is imported to a\r\nlimited extent.\r\n\r\nYarrow is a weed common from the New England states to Missouri. It\r\nis imported in small quantities, and brings from two to five cents\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\nCanada fleabane brings from six to eight cents per pound. Of\r\njimsonweed, leaves are imported, from 100,000 to 150,000 pounds\r\nannually, and 10,000 pounds of seed. Leaves bring two and one half\r\nto eight cents per pound, and seeds from three to seven cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nOf poison hemlock, seeds are imported from ten to twenty thousand\r\npounds annually. Price for the seed is three cents per pound, for\r\nthe leaves about four cents. The flowers are also used.\r\n\r\nThe American wormseed has been naturalized from tropical America to\r\nNew England; the seed commands from six to eight cents per pound;\r\nthe oil distilled from this seed brings one dollar and a half per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nBlack mustard, which is a troublesome weed in almost every state in\r\nthe Union, is nevertheless imported in enormous quantities, the\r\ntotal imports of the seeds of the black and white mustard amounting\r\nannually to over five million pounds, the prices being from three to\r\nsix cents per pound. All these prices and quantities were before the\r\nwar and may greatly change after it.\r\n\r\nIn studying the wild drug plants, one may learn the immense variety\r\nof field salads and greens. On a visit to the Spirit Fruit Society\r\nat Ingleside, Illinois, one of the girls took me out to gather wild\r\nvegetables for dinner. We pulled up about a dozen varieties out of\r\nthe corners of a field; two or three of the nice looking ones that I\r\ngathered the young lady threw out, saying she did not know them; but\r\nit seemed to me that she took almost anything that was not too\r\ntough. The following are commonly used as salads: Dandelion, yellow\r\nracket, purslane (pusley), watercress, nasturtium; and the following\r\nas greens for cooking: narrow or sour dock, stinging nettle,\r\npokeweed, pigweed or lamb's quarters, black mustard. Young milkweed\r\nis better than spinach, and also makes an excellent salad. Probably\r\nall the salad leaves could be cooked to advantage. Rhubarb leaves\r\nand horseradish tops are garden greens usually neglected most\r\nunfairly.\r\n\r\nOsage Orange _(maclura aurantiaca)_ is generally supposed to be\r\npoison, and is described in Webster's dictionary as \"a hard and\r\ninedible fruit,\" but I have found one kind, at least, superior to\r\nquinces.\r\n\r\nCapsicum or red pepper, licorice (the imports of which have all been\r\nin the hands of one person), camphor, belladonna, henbane, and\r\nstramonium are possible fields for culture; but they are all\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nIf you are growing poppies for the flowers it might be worth while\r\nto gather some opium, especially if the new process succeeds in\r\nseparating morphine directly from the plant.\r\n\r\nCaraway seeds, anise, coreander, and sage are common garden plants\r\nthat may be sold as drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nNOVEL LIVE STOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nOccasionally we hear stories of the wealth which is being made on a\r\nfrog farm here or there. But as a rule little commercial success has\r\nattended attempts in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty lies in feeding them. A single frog can be fed by\r\ndangling a piece of meat before it, but it would be impossible to\r\nfeed thousands this way. There are so many enemies that few tadpoles\r\nbecome adult frogs; besides, the frog is a cannibal and will eat not\r\nonly the larvae or eggs, but the tadpoles and young frogs as well.\r\n\r\nFrog culture is successful in some places where ponds are large\r\nenough to be partitioned, separating the tadpoles and young frogs\r\nfrom the old ones, and where insects are abundant enough to supply\r\nfood naturally for them. Near San Francisco there are a number of\r\nfrog ranches. Even in 1903, according to Mary Heard in _Out West,_\r\none ranch sold to San Francisco markets 2600 dozen frogs' legs,\r\nnetting $1800. This was considered poor. Frogs' legs are sold to\r\nhotels and restaurants, and bring in New York, according to size and\r\nseason, from fifty cents to a dollar a pound.\r\n\r\nTons of frogs come to New York markets each year from Canada,\r\nMichigan, and from the South and West. Few people outside of the\r\ncities eat them. The United States Fish Commissioners reported the\r\nproduct in one year: Arkansas, 58,800 lb., valued at $4162; Indiana,\r\n24,000 lb., valued at $5026; Ohio, 14,000 lb., valued at $2340;\r\nVermont, 5500 lb., valued at $825, etc.--a total of $22,953.\r\n\r\nThe enormous and increasing prices of large diamond backed turtles,\r\nand the cheapness of little ones shows that maturing, at least, if\r\nnot actually breeding them, would be well worth investigation. Many\r\nwealthy New Yorkers send direct to Maryland for their supplies.\r\nWhere turtle meat is bottled or canned, the snapping turtle and the\r\ncommon box tortoise are sometimes used as \"substitutes.\" Both are\r\ncapital eating.\r\n\r\nThe carp is one of the most excellent fresh water fish, and is of\r\ngreat value on account of the facility of culture and the enormous\r\nextent to which this is carried on. \"In Europe some artificial ponds\r\ncomprise an area of no less than 20,000 acres, and the proceeds\r\namount to about 500,000 pounds of carp per annum.\" (Hessel, in \"Carp\r\nand Its Culture.\")\r\n\r\nIt attains the weight of three to four pounds in three years without\r\nartificial feeding, and much more under more favorable conditions.\r\nIt lives to a great age and continues to grow all the while.\r\n\r\n\"In Europe it is common to see carp weighing from thirty to forty\r\npounds and more, measuring nearly three and one half feet in length\r\nand two and three quarters feet in circumference.\"\r\n\r\nIt lives on vegetable food, insects, larvae, and worms, and will not\r\nattack other fishes or their spawn. It is easy to raise, and,\r\nprovided certain general rules are followed, success will attend its\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe localities best adapted to a carp pond are those in which there\r\nis sufficient water at hand for the summer as well as the winter. A\r\nmud or loam soil is best adapted for such a pond. A rocky, gravelly\r\nground is not suited for carp; the water should be the same depth\r\nall the year, as variation has an injurious effect on the fish.\r\n\r\nCarp spawn in the spring. In stocking a pond three females are\r\ncalculated to two males. The females lay a great number of eggs, but\r\nonly a small number are impregnated. The most liberal estimate will\r\nnot exceed from 800 to 1000 to one spawner, the aggregate per acre\r\namounting to from 4000 to 5000.\r\n\r\nThe large cities containing large numbers of Europeans furnish the\r\nprincipal markets for carp. The Jewish people will not, as a rule,\r\nbuy carp unless they are alive, so it is not an uncommon thing to\r\nsee fish dealers in the Hebrew quarters pushing through the streets\r\ncarts constructed as tanks and peddling the carp alive.\r\n\r\nSome years ago carp ponds were quite a fad among farmers of the\r\nCentral West. Americans have been slow to adopt the German carp as a\r\nfood fish.\r\n\r\nTrout, of course, can be raised, and the high prices which they\r\nbring, both in market and for fishing privileges, make them very\r\nattractive; but the cold running water needed makes opportunity for\r\nbreeding them with access to a good market generally unavailable to\r\nowners of five acres.\r\n\r\nThere is another fish, famous for its eating qualities, which well\r\nrepays effort put upon its production. I refer to the black bass. It\r\nis indigenous to the waters of the Eastern states, where it is\r\nusually found in creeks or rivers. It can be successfully bred in\r\nproperly constructed ponds.\r\n\r\nMr. Dwight Lyell, in Forest and Stream, has this to say about a\r\nbreeding place for the small-mouthed black bass. \"The pond should be\r\nsix feet deep in the center and two feet around the edge; the bottom\r\nshould be of natural sand; water plants should be growing in\r\nprofusion, particularly such aquatic plants as the Daphnia, Bosmina,\r\nand the Corix, to furnish food for the young bass. A good size for a\r\nbreeding pond is 100 X 100 feet.\" For spawning, artificial nest\r\nframes are built in rectangular form. They are made two feet square\r\nwithout bottoms. On two adjoining sides these frames are four inches\r\nhigh and on the other two adjoining sides sixteen inches high. These\r\nframes are made because the bass needs a barrier behind which the\r\nspawning may be done and which will protect the nest when made. For\r\nraising the fish to a size large enough for food, ponds can be of\r\nany convenient size. In order to keep the water in healthful\r\ncondition the pond must be fed by a flowing brook with some\r\nprovision to prevent the water being disturbed by freshets. This can\r\nusually be arranged by a sluice to carry off the surplus water\r\nduring heavy rains. Black bass raised in shallow ponds will take the\r\nfly all summer, so that considerable may be made from fishing\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of minnows, which are the food of the bass, they must\r\nbe fed on fresh liver cut in threads like an angle worm to tempt the\r\nfish. Even then the liver diet must be varied by feeding minnows\r\nfrom September until the bass goes into winter quarters. In no other\r\nway can fertile eggs be assured for the spring hatching. Minnows\r\nleft in the pond all winter will breed and so furnish fry on which\r\nthe young bass can feed the next summer.\"\r\n\r\nWhat has been said refers particularly to the small-mouthed black\r\nbass. The conditions are substantially the same for the\r\nlarge-mouthed bass (which grows to a much larger size), except that\r\nthe bottom may be made of Spanish moss imbedded in cement.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing market for the young bass or fingerlings to stock\r\nstreams and ponds. The relation between the producer of stock fish\r\nand those who expect to raise bass of a marketable size is about the\r\nsame as exists between the professional seed grower and the market\r\ngardener. It is much better for the small farmer who has or can make\r\nan artificial pond to buy his fingerlings from the professional\r\nbreeder, who has facilities which are too elaborate to be duplicated\r\non a small scale.\r\n\r\nFish culture, except under government auspices, is little known in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n_American Homes and Gardens_ has an account of the breeding of\r\npheasants, which is of interest. That it is possible to breed\r\npheasants, even around an ordinary suburban home, is shown by Mr.\r\nHomer Davenport, the famous cartoonist, who succeeded in breeding\r\nand raising some of the choicest pheasants on his place at Morris\r\nPlains, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nA great variety of species are commonly bred, but all of them came\r\nfrom China or India. The pheasant can be tamed by careful handling,\r\nbut cats and dogs and other small animals must be kept away. The\r\npheasantry should be placed on high, well-drained ground with a\r\nsouthern exposure, where the soil is good enough to raise clover,\r\noats, and barley. The quarters for pheasants and the management are\r\nvery much like those for fancy chickens. The yard should be inclosed\r\nby wire netting both on sides and top to keep the birds from\r\nwandering away; and there should be houses for roosting and breeding\r\nwith nesting quarters attached.\r\n\r\nIn Central Park, New York, the running space allotted to three or\r\nfour birds is not more than ten by twenty feet, and Mr. George\r\nEthelbert Walsh tells of a case where sixty pheasants were kept in\r\nexcellent condition in a house ten by fifty feet, with five yards\r\nattached, averaging 10 X 25 feet. However, with pheasants, as with\r\nall the bird family, especially turkeys, the more ground they have\r\nfor ranging the less liable they will be to disease. The chief\r\ndifficulty in breeding game birds like the pheasant is to secure the\r\ninsects, such as flies, maggots, and ant eggs, which are the natural\r\nfood of the young. Sufficient green food like lettuce, turnip tops,\r\ncabbage, etc., must also be provided. There is always a market at\r\nfancy prices for more of the matured birds than can possibly be\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nSome people make money in breeding or training fancy birds like\r\ncanaries, mocking birds, finches, parrots, and so on; but this\r\nindustry can be carried on almost as well in rooms in the city as in\r\nthe country. Specializing on any kind of animal rearing must be gone\r\ninto with extreme caution, because in the breeding of animals there\r\nare many factors to be dealt with which do not confront the breeder\r\nof plants. Make haste slowly, and before branching out be sure that\r\nyou master each step in its turn.\r\n\r\nAn industry which is practically unknown in this country, but which\r\nflourishes in Burgundy, France, is the raising of snails for food.\r\nThose who are shocked by this will be surprised to learn that snail\r\nculture was practiced by the Romans at the time of the Civil War\r\nbetween Caesar and Pompey, as Jacques Boyer says in_ American Homes\r\nand Gardens._ The snail lays from fifty to sixty eggs annually. They\r\nare deposited in a smooth hole prepared for them in the ground and\r\nhatched within twenty days. So rapidly do they grow that they are\r\nready for market six or eight weeks after hatching. The snail park\r\nis made by inclosing a plot of damp, limy soil with smooth boards\r\ncoated with tar to prevent the snails climbing out, and held in\r\nplace by outside stakes strong enough to withstand the wind. The\r\nboards must penetrate the soil to the depth of eight inches at\r\nleast, and at a level with the ground they must have a sort of shelf\r\nto prevent the snails from burrowing under them. When the snail\r\nencounters an obstacle in its path, it lays its eggs, sensible\r\nbeast. Ten thousand snails can be raised on a plot of land one\r\nhundred by two hundred feet. The ground is plowed deeply in the\r\nspring, the snails are placed on it and covered with from two to\r\nfour inches of moss or straw which is kept damp. They must be fed\r\ndaily with lettuce, cabbage, vine leaves, or grass; as they eat at\r\nnight, they are fed shortly before sunset. Aromatic herbs, like\r\nmint, parsley, etc., are planted in the inclosure to improve the\r\nflavor of the snails.\r\n\r\nIn October, the snails having become fat through the summer, retire\r\ninto their shells, the mouths of which they close with a thin\r\ngelatinous covering. They are now ready for picking, and are put on\r\nscreens or trays which are piled together in storehouses, where they\r\nremain several months without food. When the fast has been\r\nsufficiently prolonged, the shells are brushed up and the snails\r\ncooked in salt water in a great pot holding about ten thousand. When\r\ncooked, they are immediately sent to the consumer in wooden boxes\r\nholding from fifty to two hundred. The business is a very profitable\r\none, as the snail is considered a great delicacy by epicures.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the silkworm is not exactly in place in a chapter on Novel\r\nLive Stock. It is at present not much more than an interesting\r\nexperiment, but there will be money in silkworm culture as soon as a\r\nmarket for the product is developed. The main difficulty is lack of\r\nfood, as the worm thrives best on the leaf of the white mulberry\r\ntree. Until a substitute is found, it will be necessary therefore to\r\nset out young trees, which in two years will bear enough leaves to\r\nsupply food. The labor of silkworm rearing all comes in one month.\r\nIt can be carried on in any large, airy room The eggs are hatched by\r\nthe summer heat, and the worm does not become a heavy eater until\r\nthe last two weeks. It sheds its skin four times, and after the\r\nfinal moult it climbs into loose brush prepared for it and spins the\r\ncocoon. These are then dried and shipped.\r\n\r\nAt the South, where the climate is well suited for silk culture, an\r\nobstacle has been found in the unadaptability of the cheap labor,\r\nparticularly colored labor, to the delicate handling, and especially\r\nwinding of the silk from the cocoons.\r\n\r\nMany people make money by breeding dogs. Not much land is required\r\nand very little capital, as kennels can be multiplied as demand\r\nincreases. There is always a profitable market for dogs, and some of\r\nthe lap species, like the King Charles spaniel, bring fabulous\r\nprices. Hunting dogs, such as setters, pointers, retrievers, really\r\nrequire a game country and a practical hunter who can train the\r\npuppies, to make much of a success of it; with these, if properly\r\nhandled, the business is a safe one, as there is little other\r\ntechnical skill required beyond ordinary care, such as is given to\r\ndomestic animals.\r\n\r\nCats are a better venture than dogs because they are sold to women\r\nwho will pay any price for what strikes their fancy. Fashions in\r\ncats change about as fast as fashions in coats, but cats breed\r\nfaster than coats wear out, so it is quick business.\r\n\r\nJust now, coon cats, tortoise-shell cats, and bizarre colors of\r\nPersian cats are mostly in vogue, but the tailless Manx cat, and\r\neven freaks like the six-toed cat and Iynx cats always find a ready\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nOf course, these can be raised in the city, but if it is done in a\r\nlarge enough way to make a living out of it, the Board of Health and\r\nthe neighbors will raise--something else.\r\n\r\nFishing and hunting are primitive industries of which we think only\r\nin connection with wild land. But every bay and pond and wood will\r\nsupply at least some subsistence or profit to the intelligent\r\nseeker.\r\n\r\nOysters, clams, crabs, mussels, frogs, and common fish are found in\r\nabundance in many places, and help out with table expenses. Even\r\nEnglish sparrows are delicious.\r\n\r\nAlmost any wild animal is much more wholesome to eat than pork.\r\nSquirrels and even weasels are cleaner feeders than pigs, and the\r\nIndians eat them with great relish, while everybody knows the\r\nkeenness of the darkies for \"coon.\" Most snakes are better eating\r\nthan eels and not near so repulsive--when you get used to them.\r\n\r\nThe woodchuck is a nuisance to the farmer, covering his field with\r\nloads of subsoil from the burrow and then eating the tender sprouts;\r\nand the farmer does not know enough to eat his tender corpse, but he\r\nis good to eat. If a rabbit and a chicken could have young, it would\r\ntaste like a woodchuck.\r\n\r\nMuskrats, mink, raccoons, and gray and fox squirrels are easily\r\ntrapped; and the skins of those killed in that way find a steady\r\nmarket. Skins of poisoned animals do not sell so well, as they are\r\nrough and dry.\r\n\r\nIn order to be profitable, these do not need to pay very well in\r\nproportion to the time they take, since they are hunted as\r\nrecreation and at odd times.\r\n\r\nBut there is a larger field in raising wild animals, which our\r\nWestern people have not been slow to avail themselves of, and we\r\nhear of men being prosecuted for breeding wolves, coyotes, and\r\nbobcats, a kind of lynx, to get the government bounty for the snouts\r\nor scalps.\r\n\r\nIn a legitimate way profit may be had from such animals.\r\n\r\nErnest Thompson Seton has an article in _Country Life in America,_\r\non raising fur-bearing animals for profit; this offers a good\r\nchance for small capital and large intelligence. He suggests the\r\nbeaver, mink, otter, skunk, and marten, and says that whoever would\r\nbegin fur farming is better off with five acres than with five\r\nhundred. He describes two fox ranches at Dover, Maine. They raise\r\ntwenty to forty silver foxes a year, on a little more than half an\r\nacre of land. The silver fox's fur is one of the most valuable on\r\nthe market and sells at an average of $150 a pelt, that is, $3000 to\r\n$6000 gross for the year's work. Foxes are not expensive to breed,\r\ntheir food consisting chiefly of sour milk and cornmeal or flour\r\nmade into a cake, and a little meat about once a week.\r\n\r\nThe capital required is small. A fence for the inclosure should be\r\nof one and a half inch mesh No. 16 galvanized wire, ten feet high,\r\nwith an overhang of eighteen inches to keep the foxes from escaping,\r\nand is about the only outlay except for purchase of stock.\r\n\r\nStakes should be driven close to the fence to keep them from\r\nburrowing out.\r\n\r\nThey are naturally clean animals, and with careful attention are\r\nfree from disease. Mr. Stevens reports that in his two years'\r\nexperience he has had twenty to thirty foxes and lost none by\r\ndisease, while Mr. Norton, with five years' experience, carrying\r\nthirty to forty, reports that one to two die each year.\r\n\r\nThey breed as well in captivity as in their wild state, usually\r\nbringing forth a litter of six or seven in the spring. These breed\r\nthe following spring and their fur is ready for market the following\r\nDecember. And now breeders sell fine stock to other breeders who are\r\nentering the industry, sometimes getting three to four hundred\r\ndollars per pair. Mr. Seton remarks, \"I am satisfied that any man\r\nwho has made a success of hens can make a success of foxes, with\r\nthis advantage for the latter a fox requires no more space or care\r\nthan a hen, but is worth twenty times as much, and so gives a chance\r\nfor returns twenty times as large.\"\r\n\r\nThis is an infant industry, but if others can get the same results,\r\nit will pay handsomely. To get the best furs, however, requires a\r\ndistrict where the winters are cold and long.\r\n\r\nThere are a few skunk farms in the West. It is said that the scent\r\ngland can be taken out, though that is not necessary, and that the\r\nfarms do well. Their oil is also said to be valuable. But while\r\nskunks are so common there cannot be much in breeding them.\r\n\r\nIf your fancy goes to \"critters\" rather than crops it is much better\r\nto raise game birds. Wild turkeys raised under a hen or in an\r\nincubator and made pretty tame (if too tame they do not thrive so\r\nwell in a small area), \"wild\" ducks, grouse, partridges, quails,\r\neven wood ducks which build their nests in trees are no longer\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nAll the common enemies you have to contend against are foxes, dogs,\r\ncats, rats, mink, skunks, hawks, owls, crows, frogs, turtles,\r\nsnakes, poachers, game legislators, and disease.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that one pair of quails and its\r\nprogeny would produce five or six million birds in eight years if\r\nthere were no losses. But so would chickens; and probably you will\r\nnot get that many.\r\n\r\nAll about these game birds is set forth in an advertising booklet\r\ncalled, \"Game Farming\" of the Hercules Powder Co., which has offices\r\nin a dozen cities, so we need not enlarge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nWHERE TO GO\r\n\r\n\r\nIntensive cultivation, raising a big crop on little land, can be\r\ncarried on most profitably near areas of dense population; for\r\nperishable products, like fruits and vegetables, can be best\r\nmarketed near the consumer. The limit for delivery by auto is about\r\nfifteen to twenty miles, and then only if roads are good; if the\r\nland selected lies on the line of a railroad which gives equal terms\r\nto way freight and to through freight, you will fare nearly as well.\r\nRailroads control agricultural development. Sparsely settled regions\r\nalways practice extensive cultivation, raising light crops on big\r\nfarms, because only such crops can be grown as can be raised on\r\nlarge areas by machinery, and are not perishable. Staples like corn,\r\nwheat, pork, and beef are transported at low prices for long\r\ndistances by the railroads. This forces the settlers in newly opened\r\nportions of the country to sell in a market created by the\r\nrailroads, in competition with what is produced within the areas of\r\nintensive cultivation, that is, with access to adjacent markets.\r\n\r\nSo we find the bonanza wheat farms of California, the Dakotas, and\r\nthe Canadian Northwest, the pampas of the Argentine, the Steppes of\r\nRussia, and the Indian uplands devoted to wheat raising; in the\r\nUnited States corn belt, fields of from five to twenty thousand\r\nacres are still not uncommon. Conversely, intensive cultivation is\r\nmost advanced in China, where a dense population forced the people\r\nlong ago to bring into use every foot of tillable soil that is left\r\nopen to them.\r\n\r\nNear the towns of the United States a few market gardeners supply\r\nsuch vegetables as the people do not raise for themselves. The\r\nstates along the Atlantic seaboard have all the facilities for\r\nsuccessful intensive cultivation--a dense population and idle,\r\ncultivable land. In choosing a location, the home crofter should\r\nwell consider his experience, and try to enter a community where he\r\ncan engage in analogous pursuits. Dairy regions never have enough\r\nmen who understand cattle and horses; fruit-growing districts always\r\nneed experienced pickers; market garden regions need men who\r\nunderstand rotating crops and making hotbeds, transplanting, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you have a little money, you can probably do best by buying and\r\ndraining some swamp land, which is the most productive of all, as it\r\ncontains the washings of the upland for centuries. Swamp land can\r\nusually be cleared and drained for from thirty to forty dollars per\r\nacre. It can be bought very cheap and when ready to cultivate will\r\nhave increased many times in value.\r\n\r\nThe next best is the \"abandoned\" or worn-out farm. Proper methods of\r\ncultivation will bring it back to more than its original fertility.\r\nThe Eastern states from Maine to Virginia abound with them at from\r\nfive to twenty-five dollars per acre. In many cases the buildings\r\nare worth more than the whole price asked.\r\n\r\nThe nearest land easily available in the East is in the state of New\r\nYork. The writer believes it is true that \"there are twenty thousand\r\nfarms for sale in this state, and nearly, all at such low prices and\r\nupon such favorable terms as to make them available for any one\r\ndesiring to engage in agriculture or have a farm home. The soil of\r\nthese farms is not exhausted, but on the contrary is, with proper\r\ncultivation, very productive. Nearly all have good buildings and\r\nfences, are supplied with good water and plenty of wood for farm\r\npurposes, and in nearly all cases have apple and other fruit trees\r\nupon them.\" (List of Farms, occupied and unoccupied, for sale in New\r\nYork State. Bureau of Information and Statistics, Bulletin, State of\r\nNew York, Department of Agriculture.)\r\n\r\nThese farms are distributed all over the state, some in nearly every\r\ncounty. In Sullivan County, for example, there are farms for sale\r\nranging in price from ten to one hundred dollars per acre. These\r\ncan, almost without exception, be bought by small payments, balance\r\non long mortgages, and it is wonderful how cheap they are. In Ulster\r\nCounty thirty farms, some of which I have seen, are offered for sale\r\nat trifling prices.\r\n\r\nOf course, many of these farms have been sold since the first\r\neditions of this book, and the prices have advanced, perhaps on the\r\naverage doubled; but cheap automobiles have improved roads and have\r\nmade others available that were useless ten years ago. The\r\ndevelopment of the Southern states, with eradication of the cattle\r\ntick (the cause of \"Texas Fever\") and irrigation and rotation of\r\ncrops, has opened up new countries. N. O. Nelson writes he has\r\nbought many Louisiana farms for his cooperative enterprise for about\r\nwhat the improvements are worth.\r\n\r\nCut over woodlands which we have learned to make produce incomes of\r\nabout five dollars each year per acre by intelligent forestry, as\r\nwell as swamp lands which we now know how to make healthful by\r\ndrainage and by the extinction of mosquitoes, can still be had at\r\nlow prices in New York and other states. Numerous others are in the\r\nmarket from five dollars per acre up, and so it goes through the\r\nstate, from Wyoming County in the extreme western end, where farms\r\nranging from thirty to three hundred acres are in the market at from\r\nthirty to forty dollars per acre, to St. Lawrence County in the\r\nnorth, where land can be bought as low as fifteen dollars per acre.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that these lands are within easy access to\r\nestablished markets with transportation and mail facilities, rural\r\ndelivery, and telephone a proper idea may be formed of their value\r\nin opportunity. The authority quoted further states that \"probably\r\nfifty thousand agricultural laborers can find employment on the\r\nfarms of New York at good wages. Families particularly are wanted to\r\nrent houses and work farms on shares.\" Wages for new hands run from\r\ntwenty to thirty dollars and upwards per month with board. Men who\r\nknow how to milk are especially in demand throughout the dairy\r\nregions. These conditions make it possible for experienced farmers,\r\nalthough entirely without money, to get to the soil.\r\n\r\nOver three hundred thousand aliens annually settled in the cities of\r\nNew York State during some years in the last decade. These people\r\ncould be got out of the cities, where in normal times they are\r\nlittle needed, into adjacent country districts where they are much\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIn the _Real Estate Record and Guide,_ Mr. A. L. Langdon says: \"It\r\nis most remarkable that there are on Long Island, within from\r\nthirty-five to seventy miles of New York, thousands of acres of land\r\nwhich have never been cultivated, which have for years produced\r\nnothing but cordwood, and which the owners allow to be overrun with\r\nfire almost every year. A large part of this land has soil two or\r\nthree feet deep underlaid with gravel. The best water in the world\r\nis abundant and the climate is more equable than on the mainland,\r\nand in each locality where any reasonable effort has been made to\r\ncultivate the soil, it has produced plentifully of all fruits and\r\nvegetables which can be grown in this latitude.\"\r\n\r\nLong Island should produce all the fruit, vegetables, poultry, eggs,\r\nand milk needed by its own residents, with a large surplus for the\r\ncity markets, instead of getting, as it does, a large part of its\r\nsupply of these things from the city.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that about a quarter of a million acres of\r\nthis land so close to the city is now scrub oak and uncultivated\r\nwaste, and that there are about a million adult workers in the city,\r\nthe importance of the experiment is obvious; especially as we learn\r\nfrom the United States census that over ten thousand of these\r\nworkers are already in agricultural pursuits within the city limits.\r\n\r\n\"Here midway on Long Island, and just beyond the limits for a man to\r\nlocate who expects to earn his living by daily work in the city, is\r\na territory about forty miles long and ten miles wide which by\r\nintensive farming would yield a good living for more than two\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants. In this agricultural section, a man of\r\nsmall means who expects to live on the land the year round, should\r\npurchase a plot not too small to produce enough to support himself\r\nand family and a surplus to sell, not less than six acres. Probably\r\nall men have more or less land hunger a desire to own land and it is\r\na worthy object to encourage to the extent of inducing a man to\r\npurchase what he can pay for and be satisfied with, but it is a\r\nshameful thing to induce a poor man, who has to earn his living in\r\nNew York, to buy on the installment plan a small lot so far from his\r\nplace of employment that he cannot live on it and travel to and from\r\nhis work every day, and where there is the strongest probability\r\nthat he will never make more than two or three payments, and will\r\nconsequently lose what he does pay.\" The writer hears of one plot\r\nwhich was sold nineteen times and the contracts defaulted on after\r\npayments, before any one took title.\r\n\r\nIf the seeker is not satisfied with the opportunities which the\r\nstate of New York offers, he may turn to New Jersey, equally\r\naccessible and equally rich in chances.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey Year-Book: \"There are in the southern part of the State\r\nlarge tracts of land which are still uncleared, or covered with\r\nbrushwood, and which are adapted to tillage and capable of producing\r\nlarge crops of small fruits and market garden vegetables. The wood\r\non them is mainly scrub oak, with some dwarfed pitch pine and yellow\r\npine, and hence they are called oak lands to distinguish them from\r\nthe more sandy lands and tracts on which the pitch pine grows almost\r\nexclusively. The latter are known as pine lands. The total area of\r\ncleared (farm) lands in the southern division of the State,\r\nsoutheast of the marl belt, is about 450,000 acres. The pineland\r\nbelts have an aggregate area of 486,000 acres, making at least\r\n800,000 acres accessible by railways from the large cities and also\r\nnear to tidewater navigation. The maps of the Geological Survey show\r\nthe location and the extent of these lands, their railway lines, and\r\ntheir relation to the settlements already made and to the cities.\r\n\r\n\"The soils of these tracts are sandy and not naturally so rich and\r\nfertile as the more heavy clay soils of the limestone, the red\r\nshale, and the marl districts of the State, but they are not so\r\nsandy and so coarse-grained as to be non-productive, like some of\r\nthe pineland areas. The latter are often deficient in plant food and\r\nare deservedly characterized as pine barrens, being too poor for\r\nfarm purposes. The growth of oak and pine, as well as chemical\r\nanalyses, shows that the oak-land soils contain the elements of\r\nplant production. They are not so well suited to pasturage or to\r\ncontinuous cropping as naturally rich virgin soils; they are better\r\nfitted for raising vegetables, melons, sweet potatoes, small fruits,\r\npeaches, and pears than wheat, Indian corn, hay, and other staples.\r\nThe eminent superiority of this kind of farming in New Jersey over\r\nthe old routine of wheat, corn, hay, and potatoes is well known.\r\nThese South Jersey soils are easily cleared of brushwood or standing\r\ntimber, and of stumps, with a hand or horse-power puller which is a\r\ncheap affair, and the wood is salable in all this part of the State\r\nat remunerative prices, often bringing more than the original cost\r\nof the land. The long working season and the short and mild winter\r\nfavor the arrangement of work, so that all is done with the least\r\noutlay for help. They also favor the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\"The success of Hammonton, Egg Harbor City, Vineland, and other\r\nplaces is notable, and equally good results are to be had at a\r\nhundred or more places as well situated as they are. These lands are\r\nsold at low figures, and the settler saves in capital and interest\r\naccount. Only the difficulty of getting money to help in building\r\ninterferes with rapid settlement.\r\n\r\n\"The West Jersey Railway, the Pennsylvania, and the Philadelphia and\r\nReading's Atlantic City Railroad, the Philadelphia and Seashore\r\nRailway, the New Jersey Southern Railroad, and other branch roads\r\nafford excellent facilities for access to New York, Philadelphia,\r\nand the cities of the State. The Cohansey, Maurice, and Mullica\r\nrivers head well up near the northwest limits of these lands, and\r\ntheir navigable reaches run for miles across them. The waters of the\r\nDelaware Bay and the ocean are within a few miles of a large part of\r\nthis oak-land domain.\r\n\r\n\"The advantages of an old settled and Eastern State, within easy\r\nreach of these large markets, of land which is easily tilled and\r\ngenerous and quick in its response to feeding, and at low prices,\r\nmake them equal to, if not better than, the rich prairie soils of a\r\nnew West, or the low prices and cheap lands of the abandoned\r\nhillsides of New England.\"\r\n\r\nWages for unskilled farm labor are about the same as for New\r\nYork--twenty to twenty-five dollars per month. The canning and fruit\r\nindustries make room for a large number of people in the late summer\r\nand fall, who may thus, by taking a temporary place, kind some\r\npermanent location where they may improve their health and fortunes.\r\n\r\n\"Delaware also offers unequalled opportunities to immigrants. It is\r\nideally situated on the Atlantic Ocean and the Delaware Bay, and is\r\npenetrated by numerous creeks and rivers.\r\n\r\n\"The railroad, steam, and electric facilities of the State are\r\ndeveloping steadily year by year, while every section of the State\r\npossesses easily navigable streams, with vessels for carrying\r\nfreight and passengers.\r\n\r\n\"Over fifteen millions of people live within a radius of three\r\nhundred miles; the large majority reside in cities and towns and\r\nfurnish the finest markets in the world. Within five hundred miles\r\nare more than one third of the people of all North America.\r\n\r\n\"Wilmington is a city of seventy-five thousand people, is growing\r\nrapidly, and is becoming a great manufacturing place.\r\n\r\n\"These people may be reached in one day by the luscious fruits that\r\ngrow in Delaware, and every one of them is perfectly happy when he\r\ngets a Delaware peach. Many other Delaware products are as good as\r\nthe peaches.\r\n\r\n\"As cattle and wheat raising developed in the great West, Delaware\r\npeople thought that they were ruined. They did not change at once,\r\nbut slowly discovered that the light lands are wonderfully\r\nproductive of fruits and vegetables, and that they pay much better\r\nthan cattle and grain ever could. But these new methods have not\r\nbeen adopted in all parts of the State, so that land neglected and\r\nunprofitable is for sale. The tides of immigration have swept\r\nwestward and left Delaware untouched. Men, money, and enterprise are\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n\"There are few unoccupied or 'abandoned' farms in Delaware.\" The\r\nland is mostly held by descendants of the early settlers, who form a\r\nspecies of landed aristocracy. Lately, owing to the younger members\r\nof these families having become established in the newer states and\r\non account of the death or incapacity of the older members left in\r\npossession, there has been a marked tendency to sell off these\r\nfarms. However, \"a large proportion of the farms in Delaware are not\r\nfor sale at any price. Some of them have been in the same family for\r\ngenerations, and if put on the market would sell for from one to two\r\nhundred dollars per acre.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil is all the way from a heavy white oak clay, which is too\r\nstiff and too sticky for most crops, to very light sand.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest clay is made lighter and more porous, and the lightest\r\nsand is readily made retentive of moisture and extremely productive,\r\nby plowing in different kinds of crops as green manure, such as cow\r\npeas, soy beans, the vetches, etc.; crimson clover, winter oats,\r\nrye, turnips, and numerous other crops may be sown in August or\r\nlater, and produce a fine crop for turning under early in the\r\nspring. Crimson clover grows nearly all winter. Pure cold water is\r\nreached at from twenty to fifty feet by dug or driven wells.\r\n\r\nThe climate is good; there are no cyclones. There is some damp\r\nweather in winter, but there are no malignant fevers, and there is\r\nlittle or no malaria, except in a few marshy places. There are some\r\nmosquitoes and flies, but they are not especially troublesome, and\r\nthere are no poisonous reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe population is mostly native, five sixths white, one sixth\r\ncolored. The white population is almost entirely of Anglo Saxon\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\n\"Perfect titles may be secured, but all titles everywhere should\r\nalways be searched by a competent lawyer, the usual fee for which is\r\nten to twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Farm hands receive from twenty to twenty-five dollars per month and\r\nboard, for a season of nine or ten months, sometimes for the whole\r\nyear. Day hands receive from seventy-five cents to two dollars per\r\nday and board themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThose who are tempted by the advertisements for fruitpickers should\r\nbeware. Delaware, like some other states, allows fees to constables\r\nand to the \"squires\"--Justices of the Peace they would be\r\nelsewhere--for arrests, and it is a common practice to advertise for\r\nfruit pickers, then arrest them as tramps when they come, and the\r\nnext day release them on condition that they will leave the county\r\nat once--and leave the trap open for the next comer.\r\n\r\nDelaware peaches have made fortunes for many, but will make still\r\ngreater fortunes in the future for the owners of the land.\r\n\r\nPears, plums, grapes, watermelons, and cantaloupes thrive, and find\r\nan ideal home, and small fruits all flourish. Sweet potatoes yield\r\nbountifully and are of the finest quality. Asparagus and early white\r\npotatoes pay handsome profits. Tomatoes, the great canning crop, are\r\ngrown by the thousands of acres.\r\n\r\n\"The grasses and clovers grow in luxuriance, and hence dairying and\r\nbeef production are profitable. Poultry pays as well as anywhere\r\nelse; chickens often run on green clover all through the open\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\"The game consists of various species of ducks, quails, reed birds,\r\nhares, marsh rabbits, and other small creatures. Shad, trout,\r\nherring, crocus, black bass, pike, white fish, rock fish, oysters,\r\nclams, crabs, and terrapin are abundant in Delaware waters.\"\r\n\r\nThe tax in the rural counties is generally sixty cents on the\r\nhundred dollars. Besides this there are taxes on business and a very\r\nlight school tax. There is no state tax, yet the state makes large\r\nappropriations for the support of the public schools, which are free\r\nto everybody.\r\n\r\nMaryland has established a State Bureau of Immigration in Baltimore\r\nto give information to home seekers, and advise them as to choice of\r\nlocation, opportunities for getting started in agricultural\r\nproduction, and aid them in any way consistent with a State Bureau.\r\nMost of these facts are taken from such reports.\r\n\r\nSouthern Maryland and the eastern shore are especially adapted to\r\ngardening and trucking, as well as fruit growing. Land is cheap and\r\ncan be purchased in tracts of any size from an acre upwards, at from\r\nten to fifty dollars per acre. Farms from twenty acres to seven\r\nhundred acres and up are for sale in nearly every county in the\r\nstate. The removal of a large part of the negro population from the\r\ncountry to the cities has resulted in the partition of the large\r\nestates into smaller farms, thus affording an opportunity for home\r\nseekers who are seeking cheap land amid congenial surroundings.\r\nNearly all of these farms have buildings, some in need of repair,\r\nothers in very good condition.\r\n\r\nFor those who wish to avoid the hard work of breaking woodlands, the\r\neastern and western shores offer abundant well-cultivated lands with\r\nbuildings, orchards, and woods, in the immediate vicinity of\r\nnavigable rivers and railways, on good roads at from twenty dollars\r\nper acre upwards. That seems cheap.\r\n\r\nFor settlers who are accustomed to mountainous regions, western\r\nMaryland has land for sale at even cheaper rates.\r\n\r\n\"There are many large tidal marshes in Maryland, as might be\r\nexpected in a territory watered like this state. They are of the\r\nrichest soil to be found, because the Chesapeake Bay is a great\r\nriver valley, receiving the drainage of a vast area of fertile land,\r\ncomprising nearly one third of New York and nearly all of the great\r\nagricultural states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. Every\r\nyear this drainage brings down a black sediment, called oyster mud,\r\nwhich is deposited on the marshlands and enriches the soil, making\r\nit, with proper cultivation, of productivity like that of the rice\r\nand wheat fields of Egypt. These unreclaimed lands are used chiefly\r\nfor grain.\"\r\n\r\nProper drainage of small tracts of this land would bring unsurpassed\r\nand absolutely untouched fertility.\r\n\r\nThe Chesapeake River valley is not so large as that of the Nile or\r\nGanges, but is of enough consequence to play an important part in\r\nhuman affairs and to support in comfort and prosperity a population\r\nas large as that of many famous states.\r\n\r\n\"The eastern shore is uniformly level, with good roads. The\r\nproximity of the ocean and the bay greatly modifies the temperature.\r\nIt has a great trunk railway, with connections along its entire\r\nlength, called the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania railroad,\r\nwhich furnishes direct transportation to Philadelphia, New York, and\r\nother northern cities.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the eastern shore there are many thousand acres of land devoted\r\nto garden truck, and the strawberry crop has of late years become of\r\nimportance. Over one hundred carloads of strawberries are shipped\r\ndaily during the season to the Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York,\r\nand Boston markets.\"\r\n\r\nLand properly cultivated will yield four thousand quarts of\r\nstrawberries to an acre.\r\n\r\nThe canning of various fruits and vegetables has grown to be larger\r\nthan that of any other state and is one of the most profitable of\r\nthe industries of Maryland. The principal articles canned are\r\npeaches, peas, and tomatoes.\r\n\r\nThe tomato crop is also profitable to the grower. The young plants\r\nare set out in the spring; many do this with a machine, but two\r\npersons can easily plant seven acres in a day by hand.\r\n\r\nAn acre will produce from six to eighteen tons of tomatoes,\r\naccording to the quality of the soil. All such products bring better\r\nprices now in Maryland markets than they did before canning was\r\nresorted to. The Maryland tin can is known wherever civilization\r\nreaches.\r\n\r\nTobacco is extensively produced only in southern Maryland, although\r\nit can be raised in any section of the state.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of the larger cities trucking and fruit growing\r\nare profitable, combined with poultry raising, often on farms of not\r\nmore than five or ten acres.\r\n\r\nMany farmers devote part of their time successfully to bees, and\r\nthere is nowhere a better climate for flowers than that of Maryland.\r\nTwo English florists who have settled in Baltimore County, ten and\r\nthirteen miles northeast of the city, daily send to all parts of the\r\nUnited States and even to Canada many large boxes of beautiful\r\nroses, carnations, violets, and other choice flowers. Both of these\r\nmen began on a small scale and have prospered.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who has a couple of thousand dollars to pay cash for a\r\nsmall farm in Maryland is assured of a good living. But also a less\r\nfavored settler, if he has only from four to eight hundred dollars,\r\ncan have a good start in Maryland, and probably as good a chance for\r\nindependence and prosperity as anywhere.\r\n\r\nFamilies of immigrants when traveling to the Western, Northwestern,\r\nand Southern states of America have to spend from one hundred and\r\nfifty to two hundred dollars for railroad tickets from New York to\r\ntheir destination; by going to these adjoining states they can save\r\nall that money, and invest it in land.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Department of Agriculture and Immigration also\r\npublishes information for the home seeker.\r\n\r\nTo most people the name Virginia carries with it limitless vistas of\r\ntobacco fields covered with darkies plying the hoe, or picking off\r\nthe ubiquitous worm. Before the War this picture would have been a\r\ntrue one; but since the awakening of the younger generation to a\r\nbetter understanding of her resources, together with the withdrawal\r\nof large numbers of the colored people into industrial occupations,\r\nno state offers more attractive inducements to the homecrofter than\r\nVirginia. In climate, diversity of soils, fruits, forests, water\r\nsupply, mineral deposits, including mountain and valley, she offers\r\nunsurpassed advantages. Truly did Captain John Smith, the\r\nadventurous father of Virginia, suggest that \"Heaven and earth never\r\nagreed better to frame a place for man's habitation.\"\r\n\r\nVirginia lies between the extremes of heat and cold, removed alike\r\nfrom the sultry, protracted summers of the more southern states, and\r\nthe longer winters and devastating storm and cyclones of the North\r\nand Northwest. Its limits north and south correspond to California\r\nand southern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe climate is mild and healthful. The winters are less severe than\r\nin the Northern and Northwestern states, or even the western\r\nlocalities of the same latitude, while the occasional periods of\r\nextreme heat in the summer are not more oppressive than in many\r\nportions of the North.\r\n\r\nTidewater Virginia, or the Coastal Plain, as it is sometimes called,\r\nreceives the name from the fact that the streams that penetrate it\r\nfeel the ebb and flow of the tides from the ocean up to the head of\r\nnavigation. It consists chiefly of broad and level plains, while a\r\nconsiderable portion, nearest to the bay, has shallow bays and\r\nestuaries, and marshes that are in most instances reached only by\r\nthe ocean tides. These marshes abound with wild duck and sora.\r\nTidewater is mainly an alluvial country. The soil is chiefly light,\r\nsandy loam, underlaid with clay. Its principal productions are\r\nfruits and early vegetables, which are raised in extensive \"market\r\ngardens,\" and shipped in large quantities to Northern cities. The\r\nfertilizing minerals--gypsum, marl, and greensand--abound, and their\r\njudicious use readily restores the lands when exhausted by\r\nimprovident cultivation.\r\n\r\nMiddle Virginia is a wide, undulating plain, crossed by many rivers\r\nthat have cut their channels to a considerable depth and are\r\nbordered by alluvial bottom lands that are very productive. The soil\r\nconsists of clays with a subsoil of disintegrated sandstone rocks,\r\nand varies according to the nature of the rock from which it is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe principal productions of middle Virginia are corn, wheat, oats,\r\nand tobacco. The tobacco raised in this section and in Piedmont,\r\nknown as the \"Virginia Leaf,\" is the best grown and the best known\r\nin the United States. In this section, as in Tidewater, the low\r\nbottom lands formed by the sediment of the waters are exceptionally\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nThe Piedmont section is diversified and surpassingly picturesque.\r\nThe soil is heavier than that of middle Virginia, the subsoil being\r\nof stiff and dark red clay. On the slopes of the Blue Ridge grapes\r\nof delicious flavor grow luxuriantly. These produce excellent wines,\r\nand the clarets have a wide fame. The pippin apples of this section\r\nare of unrivaled excellence.\r\n\r\nThe \"Great Valley,\" as it is descriptively called, is in the general\r\nconfiguration one continuous valley, included between the two\r\nmountain chains that extend throughout the state; it is one of the\r\nmost abundantly watered regions on the face of the globe. Deep\r\nlimestone beds form the floor of the Great Valley, and from these\r\nbeds the soil derives an exceeding fertility, peculiarly adapted to\r\nthe growth of grasses and grain, and it bears the name of the\r\n\"garden spot\" of the state.\r\n\r\nFive trunk lines of railroads penetrate and intersect the state. The\r\nlines of steamboats that ply the navigable streams of eastern\r\nVirginia afford commercial communication for large sections of the\r\nstate with the markets of this country and of Europe. Norfolk and\r\nNewport News maintain communication with the European markets by\r\nsteamers and vessels, while from these ports is also kept up an\r\nextensive commerce along the Atlantic seaboard. The seaports are\r\nnearer than is New York to the great centers of population, and\r\nareas of production, of the West and Northwest.\r\n\r\nMarket garden crops of every description can be grown. The following\r\nresult was obtained on a four-acre patch near Norfolk:\r\n\r\n\"The owner stated that in September he sowed spinach on four acres.\r\nBetween Christmas and the first of March following he cut and sold\r\nthe spinach at the rate of one hundred barrels to the acre, at a\r\nprice ranging from two to seven dollars per barrel--an average of\r\n$4.50 per barrel. Early in March the four acres were set out to\r\nlettuce, setting the plants in the open air with no protection\r\nwhatever, 175,000 plants on the four acres. He shipped 450\r\nhalf-barrel baskets of lettuce to the acre, at a price ranging from\r\n$2 to $2.75 per basket.\r\n\r\n\"Early in April, just before the lettuce was ready to ship, he\r\nplanted snap beans between the lettuce rows; and today, June 2d,\r\nthese are the finest beans we have seen this season.\r\n\r\n\"The last week in May he planted cantaloupes between the bean rows,\r\nwhich, when marketed in July, will make four crops from the same\r\nland in one year's time. The cantaloupes will be good for 250 crates\r\nto the acre, and the price will run from $1 to $1.50 per crate. A\r\ncareful investigation of these 'facts, figures, and features' will\r\nshow that his gross sales will easily reach $2000 per acre; his net\r\nprofits depend largely upon the man and the management; but they\r\nsurely should not be less than $1000 clear, clean profit to the\r\nacre.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is for farming done all out of doors. No hothouse or hotbed\r\nwork--not a bit of it, with no extra expense for hotbeds, cold\r\nframes, or hothouses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Intensive,\" thorough tillage and care of the soil will probably pay\r\nas well here as at any point in the United States.\r\n\r\nApples are the principal fruit crop of the state. There is a yearly\r\nincreasing number of trees. In one of the valley counties a\r\nseventeen-year-old orchard of 1150 trees produced an apple crop as\r\nfar back as 1905 which brought the owner $10,000, another of fifty\r\ntwenty-year-old trees brought $700. Mr. H. E. Vandeman, one of the\r\nbest-known horticulturists in the country, says that there is not in\r\nall North America a better place to plant orchards than in Virginia;\r\non account of its \"rich apple soil, good flavor and keeping\r\nqualities of the fruit, and nearness to the great markets of the\r\nEast and Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe trees attain a fine size and live to a good old age, and produce\r\nabundantly. In Patrick County there is a tree nine feet five inches\r\naround which has borne 110 bushels of apples at a single crop; other\r\ntrees have borne even more. One farmer in Albemarle County has\r\nreceived more than $15,000 for a single crop of Albemarle Pippins\r\ngrown on twenty acres of land. This pippin is considered the most\r\ndelicious apple in the world.\r\n\r\nThe fig, pomegranate, and other delicate fruits flourish in the\r\nTidewater region.\r\n\r\nNew England, from Maine to Rhode Island, is suffering from one\r\ndisease--lack of intelligent labor. Thirty years ago the sons and\r\ndaughters who, in the natural course of events, would have stayed to\r\ncultivate the home acres, left to form a part of the westward throng\r\nmaking for the level, untouched prairies of Illinois and Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe old folks have died or become incapacitated. New interests chain\r\ntheir children to adopted homes. Result,--unoccupied lands by the\r\nhundred thousand acres, awaiting energy, skill, and faith.\r\n\r\nTen dollars an acre is a common price for the rocky hills of New\r\nEngland. The choice river bottoms, and land near the larger cities\r\nis as high priced as similar land anywhere else. Intending settlers\r\ncan buy small areas for little money; usually the smallest farms\r\nhave good buildings worth in many cases more than the price asked\r\nfor the whole farm. Climatic conditions are not favorable to single\r\ncropping. In the old days general farming, grain, beef, sheep, and\r\nhogs were the rule; nowadays, special crops, dairying, fruit\r\ngrowing, etc.\r\n\r\nTobacco is the great staple in the rich Connecticut River bottoms,\r\nand even on the uplands, if properly manured, it pays from one to\r\nthree hundred dollars per acre. Tobacco can be raised on small areas\r\nfar from the railroad, as, when properly cured and packed for\r\nshipment, it is not perishable. To many the worst feature of New\r\nEngland is the climate--long, cold winters and short summers. Maine\r\nbeing farthest north suffers most in this respect, but that does not\r\nprevent her producing hundreds of thousands of tons of sweet corn\r\nfor canning and vast quantities of eggs and butter. Fruit does well\r\non the lower coast; a small orchard of peaches or plums will in\r\nthree or four years from planting make a comfortable living. Bush\r\nfruits grow in abundance and give never-failing crops.\r\n\r\nPoultry is peculiarly successful on the rocky hills, because they\r\nare nearly always dry or well drained. Dairying can be made to pay\r\nif near a creamery, or where milk can be sold at retail. The\r\nprospective settler here should bear in mind that wherever he goes,\r\nthe first year will produce little more than a kitchen garden; the\r\nsecond enable him barely to pull through, and the third give him a\r\nstart at a permanent income. In farming, as in all other businesses,\r\nonly those will succeed who know what they want and how to get it;\r\nwho have selected with care the locality best suited to the special\r\ncrops they intend to raise; and after having once made a selection,\r\nstick until they have compelled success.\r\n\r\nThe lure of the vast West and of the new South is not forgotten; but\r\nthe time has passed when the young man could go West to take a farm\r\nof Uncle Sam's. Desirable land is too expensive for the pioneer, and\r\nthe constant toil and comparative isolation of the prairie farm\r\noffers but a poor sort of liberty, though it still affords a living.\r\n\r\nBut close to the growing towns in those states small plots of land\r\ncan still be had to work with the same bright prospects that are\r\noffered near the great metropolis.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the sections within the area of intensive cultivation,\r\ntimber is still plentiful enough to make it the cheapest building\r\nmaterial; and persons who really want to get to the land can\r\ncontrive a sufficient shelter, like a pioneer's, for from two to\r\nfive hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCLEARING THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is pretty good fun to hack at bushes and to chop trees down and\r\nthen to chop them up. If there is only a small part of the land to\r\nbe cleared, a man can easily learn skill with the ax and do it at\r\nodd times, but he was a wise old man of whom his little girl said,\r\n\"When grandpa wants anything, that moment he wants it.\" It is now\r\nthat we need the land; but even if it is covered with trees, there\r\nis no cause for discouragement. Lumber is so high that the local or\r\nportable sawmill men will buy the timber by the acre. They will cut\r\nthe trees and haul the logs.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to cut a tree yourself, a little inquiry will show for\r\nwhat purpose it will bring the highest price. Locust sticks, for\r\nexample, four to six inches thick, will bring in New York ten or\r\nfifteen cents a running foot for insulator pinions. If a maple\r\nproves to be either \"curly\" or \"bird'seye\" (this depending not on\r\nthe variety, but on the accidental undulations of the fiber), it\r\nwill be in demand for the manufacture of furniture.\r\n\r\nSugar maples ten or fifteen feet high can be transplanted or sold.\r\nNut and fruit trees will nearly always be worth keeping.\r\n\r\nCedar sticks fourteen feet long will bring twenty cents in most\r\nplaces for hop and bean poles. See what can be sold instead of\r\nburned, and don't cut down recklessly; an unsalable tree may be\r\nvaluable as a windbreak or as shade for your house. The wrong tree\r\nfor shade is the dense foliaged, low-branched tree which forms a\r\nsolid dome from the ground up. The right tree, in the opinion of\r\nHenry Hicks (in _Country Life in America),_ is the American elm,\r\nwhich ought to be called the umbrella tree. Pliny speaks of the\r\nplane tree, our sycamore or buttonwood, as excellent, because of the\r\nhorizontal branches which, like window blinds, allow free passage of\r\nthe breezes while intercepting the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe ideal shade tree is a canopy like a parasol over the house, with\r\nhigh, leafy branches that do not shut off light and air from the\r\nwindows. This cools a house by keeping the sun off and cools the air\r\nby the rapid evaporation from its leaves, and will make it ten to\r\nfifteen degrees cooler in summer. It will be cheaper and more\r\neffective than a combination of awnings, piazza, and eaves. Woodman,\r\nspare that tree.\r\n\r\nStumps may be burned out To get a good draught, bore a hole in a\r\nslanting direction far down among the roots. The smoke goes through\r\nthe hole first and then the flame, boring the body to the roots deep\r\nenough to plow. Land can also be cleared by dynamite. We condense\r\nfrom Edith Loring Fullerton in _Farming,_ on what has been done.\r\n\r\nTo go into the desolate, uncultivated, burned over \"waste lands\"\r\nnear a great city and put ten acres under cultivation in the\r\nshortest possible space of time was our problem. We undertook it at\r\nshort notice in an uncertain season--the autumn--with the\r\ndetermination to get at least a portion of the land seeded down to\r\nwinter rye before cold weather prohibited further work.\r\n\r\nUnited to this problem was that of working a small farm to its\r\nutmost capacity rather than half cultivation of a large one, which\r\nis difficult to handle from lack of time and labor and an unwise\r\nproposition for the East under the most favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nTen acres of scraggy-looking woodland was purchased, sixty-eight\r\nmiles from New York City on the north shore of Long Island. The plot\r\nhad a few second and third growth oak and chestnut trees and\r\n\"sprouts\" along the borders. All else had been burned, and the\r\ncenter of the acreage exhibited the mangled and blackened remains of\r\na once thrifty woodland.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded to choose as our helpers native Long Islanders whom we\r\nwere desirous of allowing to work. We succeeded by strenuous efforts\r\nin getting together a \"gang\" of both colored and white men to the\r\nstupendous number of eight. They fell to work with a right good\r\nwill, at first cutting down here and trimming up there as directed.\r\nHowever, after giving them a fair trial, we decided that they must\r\nbe replaced by Italians. The question of housing the eighteen\r\nItalians soon came up. Tents might be adopted or even the unsanitary\r\n\"dugout\" be allowed to mar the landscape. A shanty was entirely too\r\nugly to suit our tastes, and also expensive, and useless when the\r\nmen were through with it. Tents were too airy, as we knew the work\r\nwould continue until freezing weather, and perhaps well into the\r\nwinter. We \"passed\" on the \"dugout.\" The ideal was something that\r\nwould be of use after the work of clearing was completed, and for\r\nthat purpose we decided upon \"condemned freight cars.\" They cost but\r\nten dollars each, the railroad being glad to get rid of them. We\r\nbought two, ultimately using one for a chicken house and the other\r\nas a barn. In the meantime it was decided to remove the stumps by\r\ndynamite, as trying to yank them out by stump pullers or by mattock\r\nand plow was both slow and brutal. The ordinary custom of allowing\r\nnature to work six years at the stumps and gradually eliminate them\r\nby decay was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nDynamiter Kissam, a Long Island expert, arrived and set to work,\r\nusing fuses for small stumps up to two feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Italians work began in earnest; they cleared\r\nout every useless tree, cutting cord wood where any could be\r\nobtained and burning the branches and charred trees as they went.\r\nThey also cleared out all underbrush thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe dynamiter with his helper followed them up. This is the most\r\nexciting and interesting part of clearing land by modern methods.\r\n\r\nThe dynamite is put up in half-pound sticks. They are a little\r\nlarger than an ordinary candle and are wrapped in heavy yellow\r\nparaffined paper. One folded end of this paper is opened up and a\r\nhole made by a wooden skewer into the dynamite stick, which is\r\nplastic and resembles graham bread in color and consistency.\r\n\r\nFor magneto-battery work where several charges are required, a\r\ncopper cap in which is a minute quantity of fulminate of mercury,\r\nand which is exploded by a spark, is attached to fine electric wires\r\nand sealed by sulphur. This cap is placed in holes in the sticks of\r\ndynamite, and then securely tied by drawing string tightly around\r\nthe paper which is raised to admit the cap.\r\n\r\nIn preparing a charge for fuse ignition, the cap is crimped to the\r\nend of a piece of mining fuse and this is inserted in the dynamite\r\nstick and securely fastened as previously described.\r\n\r\nThese prepared charges are placed in a basket and carried very\r\ntenderly to the stumps which have been prepared by the dynamiter's\r\nassistant. All the work is handled very carefully, for while there\r\nis not much danger of an accident unless fire is placed near the\r\nexplosive, nevertheless extreme caution is used at all times. It\r\nrequires a nature serene, calm, and deliberate.\r\n\r\nDeep oblique holes were then made with a round crowbar under the\r\nstump singled out for execution. This hole should be as nearly\r\nhorizontal as possible and directly under the stump so that all the\r\nexplosive force may be expended on the wood and not on the earth\r\nbetween the dynamite and the stump. The earth acts as a cushion and\r\nthe natural tendency of dynamite to exert force downward is\r\ncounteracted.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a small strip was blown, the Italians, gathering up all\r\nthe stumps, roots, and fragments, removing any pieces that were\r\nloosened but not completely torn out, and piling them at intervals,\r\nimmediately burned them. This cannot be done when stumps are removed\r\nby any other method, for by the digging process the earth must be\r\npicked and scraped from them and ultimately the stump hacked in\r\npieces before it will burn.\r\n\r\nBy our method the stump is burned and the finest kind of unleached\r\nwood ashes--containing lime to \"sweeten\" and potash and phosphoric\r\nacid to furnish plant food--are spread upon the ground a few hours\r\nafter the stumps are blown out. These ashes would under other\r\ncircumstances have to be purchased at a cost of perhaps two dollars\r\na barrel, and as five barrels at least to the acre are required for\r\ngood fertilization, these ashes gave us the first credit upon the\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nFollowing the burners came the manure spreaders; five carloads of\r\nmanure had been purchased and was delivered before it was needed.\r\nWhen the manure was spread upon the land (one half carload to the\r\nacre), the plow started its work smoothly and with none of the\r\nstrain and jerk on man and beast usual in new land. The soil was\r\nturned over with the greatest ease, for the explosions had shivered\r\nand torn out even the smallest roots, so the plow ran through the\r\nground much more easily than in sod land.\r\n\r\nOur friable, sandy loam, with a light admixture of clay, pulverized\r\nand aerated by the explosions, was in market garden condition at\r\nonce and without the year's loss of crops assured by old methods.\r\n\r\nA tooth harrow was next run over the plowed section, and gleaners\r\nfollowed the harrow, picking up the fine roots as they were brought\r\nto the surface. As piles of these fine roots grew, they were burned\r\nand the ashes immediately spread upon the land. The tooth harrow was\r\nrun again across the rows, the disk harrow following chopped and\r\npulverized the earth into the finest possible condition. Thirty five\r\nand one half working days after Larry and his gang arrived, rye was\r\ndrilled into three and one half acres.\r\n\r\nThe condemned freight cars were placed upon skids and drawn to the\r\ndesired position over soaped planks. They were raised from the\r\nground to give good under ventilation. The north and east sides are\r\nfilled or banked up with sand which came out of the well. This keeps\r\nout the cold winds, and, in the case of the chicken-house car,\r\nallows the fowls a shaded shelter on hot summer days.\r\n\r\nThe chicken-house car was placed facing the southeast. The western\r\nend has a large glazed sash placed on it, and two in the southern\r\nside. One half the car was partitioned off for roosting quarters,\r\nwhile the other half serves as a laying and scratching house. This\r\nfarm keeps only a few chickens for family use.\r\n\r\nThe artesian well was started in October. The well was, naturally, a\r\nnecessity, but there was much to be considered in regard to the\r\nmethod of pumping. Under ordinary circumstances a windmill would do,\r\nand is generally a good auxiliary; a ten-foot iron tower and a\r\nten-foot fan wheel cost about fifty dollars, but our farm is not to\r\nbe allowed to be a failure for lack of water in a dry season. In\r\ncase of drought (and every summer brings one of greater or less\r\nduration) water must be on hand, and as a drought usually is\r\naccompanied by windless weather, the windmill could not be depended\r\nupon. An engine was obviously necessary. Both gasoline and kerosene\r\nengines were closely investigated, with the result that a kerosene\r\noil engine was decided upon. (The new style of heavy oil engine is\r\nbetter and cheaper to run. Ed.) An advantage of the engine over a\r\nwindmill is that it will furnish power for cutting wood, grinding\r\ngrain, or lighting the buildings, a two and one half horsepower\r\nengine running twenty-five 16 c.p. lights easily.\r\n\r\nThe rye was turned under green in the spring to furnish humus, the\r\ngreatest and only vital need of this particular spot of virgin soil.\r\n\r\nSince that was written an excellent and cheap stump puller has been\r\nintroduced, but the account of work is still typical. Dynamiting is\r\nstill the modern way to clear land as well as to break up a stiff\r\nsubsoil or hardpan, so as to loosen the earth to let deep roots like\r\ntrees or alfalfa go down and to secure drainage.\r\n\r\nPrimitive American man regarded trees as \"lumber\" instead of as\r\ntimber and still destroys countless millions in valuable wood as he\r\n\"clears the ground.\"\r\n\r\nAfter it is cleared, it is vital to keep it cleared of weeds, which\r\nworse garroters of crops than trees. To do that we don't need to bow\r\nto the Earth, nor to hammer her with a hand hoe.\r\n\r\n\"The Man with the Hoe\" began to be a back number when Arkwright\r\ninvented the ark or the mule or whatever he did invent. The man with\r\nthe wheel hoe is the man that is \"It.\" A wheel hoe costs from $6 to\r\n$12, and will do the work of several men without breaking the heart\r\nor even the back of one of them. It has as many attachments as a\r\nsummer girl and is equally versatile. It must be run between the\r\nrows as soon as the ground is dry after every rain, so as to slay\r\nthe weeds before they are born. If you don't they will slay your\r\nprofits, if not yourself.\r\n\r\nCrops grown on that experimental farm are: Asparagus, berries,\r\nbeans, beets, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, carrots, cucumbers,\r\ncorn, eggplant, endive, fruit trees, kale, kohlrabi, lettuce, limes,\r\nmelons, martynias, onions, okra, parsley, parsnips, peas, potatoes\r\n(sweet and white), pumpkins, radishes, rhubarb, salsify, squash,\r\ntomatoes, etc. Marketed strictly choice radishes May 18, peas June\r\n10, lettuce June 21, beans June 29, beets July 8, carrots July 10,\r\ncabbage July 11. Surely a rapid result.\r\n\r\nHemp is hardly worth your growing for itself under ordinary\r\ncircumstances; the returns per acre are not sufficient. But Charles\r\nRichard Dodge, in one of the United States Yearbooks of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, says that as a weed killer it has\r\npractically no equal.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this, a North River farmer stated that thistles\r\nheretofore had mastered him in a certain field, but after sowing it\r\nwith hemp not a thistle survived; and while ridding the land of this\r\npest, the hemp yielded him nearly sixty dollars an acre, where\r\npreviously nothing valuable could be produced.\r\n\r\nAs it grows from Minnesota to the Mississippi Delta, its value for\r\nthis purpose is considerable.\r\n\r\nBut there is a way easier and cheaper of clearing land than by\r\nblasting, if we can afford to wait a little; and Mr. George Fayette\r\nThompson, in Bulletin No. 27, Bureau of Animal Industry, tells us\r\nhow, giving some interesting facts about Angora goats, of which the\r\nfollowing is a condensation:\r\n\r\nTo people taking up raw land, particularly where there is a heavy\r\nundergrowth to be cleared away, goats of some kind are an invaluable\r\naid. In its browsing qualities the common goat is as good as any,\r\nbut, aside from the clearing of the land, the profit in his keep is\r\nvery little, though some demand is growing up for goat's milk for\r\ninfants and for some fancy cheeses. A much better animal from the\r\nstandpoint of profit, while in use as a scavenger, is the Angora\r\ngoat. Their long, silky hair has been used for centuries in making\r\nblankets, lap robes, rugs, carpets, and particularly the \"cashmere\"\r\nshawls, formerly a great luxury in this country. Much of the camel's\r\nhair dress goods is in reality made from the hair of the Angora\r\ngoat, or mohair, as it is called. Angora goats thrive best in high\r\naltitudes with dry climates. They exist in greatest number in the\r\nUnited States in California, New Mexico, and Texas. They have been\r\nused successfully in the Willamette Valley of Oregon to eat the\r\nunderbrush off the land, doing for nothing that for which the\r\nfarmers pay Chinese laborers twenty-five to forty dollars per acre.\r\nThe cost of Angora goats is about ten to thirty dollars each for\r\ndoes, with bucks at fifty to two hundred dollars, so that even with\r\na small area of land to clear it would pay to buy a little flock for\r\nthat purpose. Dr. Shandley, of Iowa, says that two to three goats to\r\nthe acre is sufficient for cleaning up land, and that in two years\r\nthe goats will eat all of the underbrush from woodland, such as\r\nbriers, thistles, scrub oak, sumac, and, in fact, any shrub\r\nundergrowth. They need no other food than what they can secure from\r\nthe woods themselves. Consequently, the income from the sale of\r\nmohair is nearly net.\r\n\r\nThe more nearly thoroughbred the goats are, the better the mohair\r\nand the higher the price. The meat of the Angora goat is superior to\r\nmutton, although if sold in the market under the name of goat meat,\r\nit commands only half the price of mutton.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the Angora's utility in cleaning up land, the\r\nCountry Gentleman says: \"Mr. Landrum exhibited ten head at the\r\nOregon State Fair. In order to demonstrate their effectiveness as\r\nsubstitutes for grubbing, he left them on three acres of brush. At\r\nthe end of the second year the land was mellow and ready for the\r\nplow.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to build up a business in clearing lands for\r\nothers by means of a herd of Angoras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you find an \"abandoned farm\" on which the buildings are worth\r\nmore than the whole price asked, as frequently happens, you are all\r\nright. Even if the buildings are somewhat dilapidated, you can fix\r\nthem up for a few dollars. But in buying small plots of ground,\r\nlarger farms have to be broken up. If you buy from the resident\r\nowner, he may sell you five acres off his larger tract, and keep his\r\nhouse to live in. Certain it is that if a farm of 100 acres is\r\nsubdivided into twenty five-acre farms, at least nineteen new houses\r\nmust be built, although sometimes an old barn can be made into a\r\nfair residence.\r\n\r\nIf you can do no better, it is possible to start by tenting. An\r\noutfit large enough for a family of six would be about as follows:\r\n\r\n1 wall tent with fly, 10 X 14, for sleeping 1 wall tent with fly, 10\r\nX 14, for dining\r\n\r\n1 old cook stove (to be erected outdoors), 2 floors, 10 X 14, at $5\r\neach\r\n\r\nBrown tents, at least for the sleeping rooms, are best; they last\r\nlonger, are cooler, and do not attract the flies; though indeed we\r\nneed not have house flies if we keep the horse manure covered\r\nup--they are all bred in that. If the tents are in the shade, the\r\ncost of the cover or fly can be saved in the dining tent; but it is\r\nnecessary in the living tent, because wet canvas will leak when\r\ntouched on the inside. To make the tent warm for the winter, we must\r\nbank up to the edges of the platform with earth and cover the whole\r\nwith another tent of the same shape, but a foot larger in every\r\ndimension. These are commonly used in Montana.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed that no one would attempt moving in without\r\nhousehold utensils, which may be as simple or elaborate as you\r\nplease. If there is a sawmill in the vicinity, a temporary shack for\r\nwinter, say 22 X 30 feet, could be built for from $400 to $600,\r\ndepending on the interior finish. Partitions can be made very cheap\r\nby erecting panels covered with canvas, burlap, old carpet, etc.\r\nSuch a building does not need to be plastered, but can be made warm\r\nenough by an inside covering of burlap, heavy builders' paper, or\r\ncomposition board. Tar paper laid over solid sheeting makes a roof\r\nthat will last for two or three years. For such a shack draw the\r\nplans yourself. All you really need is a living room, bedroom, and\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nA cheap and effective water supply can be gotten from a driven well,\r\nwhich in most places costs about one dollar per foot. Have it where\r\nthe kitchen is to be, so that the water can be pumped into a barrel\r\nor other tank over the stove. With a good range you can have as good\r\na supply of hot and cold water as you had in the city.\r\n\r\nIf so fortunate as to find a piece of land with a good spring on it,\r\nyou can lay pipes and draw the water from that. If you can get\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet fall from the spring to the kitchen, you\r\ndon't need a pump at all.\r\n\r\nFor a toilet closet, build a shed four feet wide, six feet long, and\r\neight feet high. Use a movable pail or box. Lime slaked or unslaked\r\nor dry dust or ashes must be scattered every time the closet is\r\nused. Always clean before it shows signs of becoming offensive: keep\r\nit covered fly tight and mix the contents with earth or litter, and\r\nscatter on the garden.\r\n\r\nA shack can be built of logs which will do for comfort and will look\r\ndignified.\r\n\r\nHorace L. Pike, in _Country Life in America,_ says: \"The lot on\r\nwhich we meant to build our log house stood thirty-five feet above\r\nthe lake. The problem was how to build a cabin roomy, picturesque,\r\ninexpensive, and all on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"The ground dimensions are thirty-two by thirty feet outside. This\r\ngives a living room sixteen by fourteen; bedrooms twelve by twelve,\r\ntwelve by ten, and nine by seven; kitchen eleven by nine; a five-by\r\nfour-foot corner for a pantry and refrigerator; closet four by six,\r\nfront porch sixteen by six feet six inches, and rear porch five by\r\nfive--705 square feet of inside floor space and 130 square feet of\r\nporch.\r\n\r\n\"A dozen pine trees stand on the lot, and maneuvering was required\r\nto set a cottage among them without the crime of cutting one. The\r\nfront received the salutes of a leaning oak, the life of which was\r\nsaved by the sacrifice of six inches from the porch eaves, the trunk\r\nforming a newel post for the step railing.\r\n\r\n\"We closed the contract immediately for 120 Norway or red pine logs,\r\nthirty feet long and eight by ten inches diameter at butts. The\r\nprice was low--one or two dollars their like should have brought. We\r\nused, however, only eighty-one logs; forty thirty-foot, fourteen\r\neighteen-foot, thirteen sixteen-foot, and fourteen fourteen-foot.\r\n\r\n\"Work was begun on April 22. Two days sufficed for the owner and one\r\nman to clear and level the ground, dig post holes, set posts, and\r\nsquare the foundation. The soil was light sand with a clay hardpan\r\nthree feet down.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-seven days each were put in by two men from start to finish,\r\nwith assistance rendered by the owner. There were seven days by the\r\nmason, eight by carpenters, and four teen and one half by other\r\nlabor. On June 4 the cabin was ready for occupancy, and the family\r\nmoved in. The prices, as in most cases cited, are higher to-day.\r\nCheaper transportation or lower tariff may reduce them again.\r\n\r\n\"Making allowances for increased cost of logs and differences in any\r\nof the material cost, this cabin can be duplicated for less than\r\n$700 by any one who has the ground, a few tools, and some building\r\nability. It is compact, convenient, and more roomy than a\r\nsuperficial glance reveals, and it can be occupied (slight care is\r\nrequired) from April to November with only the kitchen stove and the\r\nfireplace supplying the heat. The same plan can be used for an\r\nall-frame structure, perhaps at less cost. It could be sheathed and\r\nslab covered in a locality where slabs, edged to six or eight inches\r\nwide, could be had; or slabs could be used perpendicularly in the\r\ngable ends and on the outside of the rear extension.\"\r\n\r\nWe must not overlook the differences in cost of lumber and labor in\r\ndifferent places, sometimes more than doubling nor the fact that\r\ndifferent contractors will vary often twenty-five per cent in their\r\nbids.\r\n\r\nA mere cabin, like a wooden tent, 12 X 10 with a platform adjoining,\r\nwill accommodate one or even two persons and can be built by a\r\ncontractor even at war prices for about fifty to one hundred\r\ndollars. This will serve for tool house or storeroom when a more\r\nconvenient residence can be afforded. A number of such can be seen\r\nat \"Free Acres,\" New Jersey, an hour from New York City on the D. L.\r\n& W. Railroad.\r\n\r\nThoughtful provision and planning will go far to reduce costs. A\r\nstove pipe which should run up inside the house, not outside, so as\r\nto conserve heat and fuel, serves as chimney and fireplace. A\r\nFranklin stove, practically an open fireplace set out entirely\r\ninside the house, is a practical device, though it costs from $18 to\r\n$30. It gives a cheerful open fire to burn wood or coal and has a\r\nflat top to keep things hot, a clutch oven of sheet iron, and a bob\r\ncan be attached to the front of the grate.\r\n\r\nBut remember that though you may have trees or fallen wood for the\r\ncutting it takes a lot of time to cut it. A cylindrical self-feeding\r\ncoal burner is most economical for heating and a lined sheet iron\r\ncooking stove for the kitchen.\r\n\r\nA fireless cooker, which retains the heat all day by means of\r\nsoapstone or insulation and slowly cooks the food without losing the\r\njuices, is an economical device. It can be made at home by copying\r\nwhat you see in the stores or by getting directions from the U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nDon't forget double windows at least toward the north; and on all\r\nwindows have heavy holland shades which make an air space between\r\nthe cold windowpanes and the atmosphere of the room.\r\n\r\nPortable houses sound attractive, but they do not pay unless you\r\nwill need to move them. Manifestly it costs more to make a house\r\nlike a trunk than like a shed. The houses shipped ready made of the\r\n\"Aladdin\" type, with all the parts ready marked to be nailed\r\ntogether by unskilled labor are a much better investment and are not\r\nshaky.\r\n\r\nIt is true that living is expensive in the train suburbs, when\r\nalmost all that is eaten comes from the city, with freight and\r\nmonopoly rates added. But one can raise most of what the family\r\neats, and save besides in car fares and doctor's bills.\r\n\r\nThe rent, perhaps a quarter of the income, that was paid for a place\r\nso small that the cat had to jump on a chair when the baby sat down,\r\nwill be a clear gain.\r\n\r\nMrs. Warrington's cottage at Rose Valley, Pennsylvania, forms a very\r\ninteresting subject, and is built from designs of well-known\r\narchitects of Philadelphia, who have taken up building small,\r\ninexpensive modern houses in a practical manner. The house is built\r\nwith a stone foundation and a wooden superstructure with exterior\r\nwalls covered with metal lath and cement stucco which is stained a\r\ncream color. The trimmings are stained a soft brown and the sashes\r\nare painted white. The roof is covered with shingles, and is left to\r\nweather finish. The front porch, from which a vestibule leads into\r\nthe house, has a hooded cover formed by the main roof sweeping down\r\nsufficiently to form a protection. The vestibule forms an entrance\r\nto both the living room and the kitchen; the kitchen is at the front\r\nof the house, allowing the main rooms and a private porch to be at\r\nthe south side. The interior throughout is trimmed with cypress and\r\nstained a soft brown. The second floor joists are exposed to view\r\nand are stained in a similar manner, while the ceiling space between\r\nthe joists is plastered. A broad archway separates the living and\r\nthe dining rooms, and while it forms a separation, it does not\r\npreclude the possibility, when desired, of throwing the two rooms\r\ninto one large apartment. The large, open fireplace is built of\r\nclinker brick, and its facings extend from the floor to the ceiling;\r\nit has a wooden shelf supported on corbeled brackets. A semi-boxed\r\nstairway rises out of the living room to the second floor. There are\r\nthree bedrooms with good-sized closets, and a bathroom on the second\r\nfloor. A cellar, under the entire house, has a cemented bottom, and\r\ncontains a laundry. This house costs about $2000 complete.\r\n\r\nHouses built of cement blocks are growing in favor. Cement blocks\r\ncan be made anywhere by unskilled labor. All that is needed is a\r\ncompetent foreman to direct the making and seasoning of the blocks\r\nand laying them in the walls.\r\n\r\nThe cost of concrete compared to frame or brick structures is, if\r\nanything, all things considered, in favor of concrete. Houses built\r\nof wood are likely to become increasingly expensive because of the\r\ndeforesting which is going on in all parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere are abundant books of plans and costs published, showing what\r\nmay be built, and several responsible publishers recklessly offer to\r\nrefund the cost of the plans if the expense of building the house\r\nexceeds their estimates.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of manufacturers of ready-made portable\r\nhouses, running in cost from about three hundred dollars for four\r\nrooms, upward. Some of these are adapted to all-the-year-round use\r\nand may be used where land is taken experimentally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nBACK TO THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Life, to the average man, means hard, anxious work, with\r\ndisappointment at the end, whereas it ought to mean plenty of time\r\nfor books and talk. There is something wrong about a system which\r\ncondemns ninety-nine hundredths of the race to an existence as bare\r\nof intellectual activity and enjoyment as that of a horse, and with\r\nthe added anxiety concerning the next month's rent. Is there no\r\nescape? Through years of hard toil I suspected that there might be\r\nsuch an escape. Now, having escaped, I am sure of it, so long as\r\noatmeal is less expensive than Hour, so long as the fish and the\r\ncabbage grows, I shall keep out of the slavery of modern city\r\nexistence, and live in God's sunshine.\" (Hubert, \"Liberty and a\r\nLiving.\")\r\n\r\nThe wealthy class are taking up farming as a healthy and beautifying\r\ndiversion, and we may expect others to follow, as it certainly\r\npromotes happiness and adds to the attractions of those who adopt\r\nit. With the aids which science has given, a farmer can now make\r\ngood profits with less labor than was formerly necessary to get a\r\nbare living. The amount that a single well-managed, well-tilled acre\r\nwill produce in a season is simply incredible. This accounts for the\r\nincreased demand for farming lands wherever they are to be had on\r\nreasonable terms. The wage earners are learning this, and it is only\r\na question of a little time when manufacturing plants will have to\r\nbe convenient to lands where the families of the hands can have a\r\nsmall tract of land to cultivate. This requires good transportation\r\nfacilities from the homes to the factories.\r\n\r\nCorporate operation has been a great aid to human progress.\r\nOrganization is man's orderly way of following the Divine Plan for\r\nhis economic salvation vet the far mer has profited less by\r\norganization than trades unions. Where farmers have organized to aid\r\neach other to buy and sell, they have gained wonderfully, but a\r\nbeginning in this direction has but served to show how much more is\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nTo the individual farmer with large area and small means, the\r\nimprovements in machinery that cheapen his production are not at\r\npresent available. The discoveries in methods of fertilization of\r\nthe soil only make it more difficult for him to earn a living in\r\ncompetition with those whose ample capital increases production by\r\nits use. Improvements in fruits and vegetation, by hybridization and\r\nvarious methods that add wealth to those of means, only add to the\r\ntroubles of our present small farmers.\r\n\r\nHitherto corporate operation has been mainly for the benefit of\r\nstockholders. The cases where those whose labor creates dividends\r\nget more than wages have been rare. \"A living wage\" has been the\r\nambition of labor itself: all profit beyond this is supposed to be\r\nthe right of capital. There is with some persons an unconscious\r\nreluctance to share profits with labor lest the laborers become\r\nindependent, and thus reduce their number to an extent to raise the\r\nlabor market, so that it is difficult to get fair consideration of\r\nany business proposition that promises better conditions for the\r\nproducer or independence for the laborer. This is undoubtedly short\r\nsighted, as the higher intelligence of the people who have land\r\nincreases production and gives enlarged opportunities for the\r\nprofitable employment of money. However, if capitalists persist in\r\nthis narrow view, the money of the people when they learn and think,\r\ncan be applied to this purpose instead of being deposited in savings\r\nbanks, where much of it is used in increasing the wealth of those\r\nwho already have abundance.\r\n\r\nThe idea of \"helping others to help themselves\" finds a responsive\r\nchord in the hearts of many wealthy people. But the question is, how\r\ncan all be helped? No business method by which this can be\r\naccomplished has, as yet, been practically demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIn no field does corporate operation promise more for the betterment\r\nof human conditions, for a higher standard of morals and of\r\neducation, or great certainty of profit for capital, than by\r\nsystematically aiding men to obtain farms.\r\n\r\nProgress proceeds on the line of returns for expenditure. When a\r\nman's economic condition permits, his first thought is to give his\r\nchildren an education and a better chance in life than he had. Those\r\nwho extol the simple life as the ideal condition of happiness do not\r\nmean that want and deprivation of necessities is the ideal\r\ncondition. If they did, they would put their children in that\r\ncondition to make them happy. Both extremes of wealth and of poverty\r\nare burdens and retard mental and moral progress. The ideal\r\ncondition is to be found on a farm where the land is paid for and\r\nample means are at hand to supply the necessities for physical\r\ndemands, with leisure to learn and enjoy those pleasures of the mind\r\nwhich come with knowledge of Nature's laws, and wisdom to live in\r\nharmony with them, and in a measure comprehend the purposes of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nMr. G. W. Smith, founder of the Hundred Year Club, suggests that\r\nthere is an opening in intensive farming for the benevolent but\r\ncanny wealthy who are interested in the soil and want to combine\r\nphilanthropy and percentage.\r\n\r\nHis plan is to get capital to secure land and all the necessary\r\nmeans, give to each approved applicant perpetual leases of land for\r\na small farm and a lot in a village site convenient thereto, with a\r\nhouse merely sufficient for shelter, requiring as a first payment\r\nsufficient to secure capital against loss in case the farmer\r\nforfeits his contract, say $100. Let the company provide scientific\r\nsupervision and conduct the operation mainly as though the farmers\r\nwere employees, all the necessaries to be charged to each with only\r\nsufficient profit to pay the expense and a fair interest on the\r\ncapital employed. Through a purchasing and sales department all\r\nproducts should be sold in the best market and each farmer credited\r\nwith the net result of his productions until the agreed sale price\r\nis received, when title should pass in fee to the farmer, who,\r\nduring the time, has become scientific so far as that piece of land\r\nis concerned, and in future can operate it with the advantages which\r\nprogress has made. A public building would be necessary for a\r\nstorehouse, in which rooms for meetings of various kinds should be\r\nprovided, also such shelter as might be necessary for assembling and\r\nstorage of products for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe expense of public buildings and other utilities could be paid\r\nfor out of the increased value that they bring to the land. The\r\ncompany should have a nursery to provide fruit tree, etc., the\r\ngrowth of which, with the increase of population would make the\r\nfarms, when paid for, worth far more than their cost. Such\r\nopportunities as this, opened to all, would do away with the tramps\r\nwho are now able to live on the charitable, only because of the\r\nknown difficulties of finding work.\r\n\r\nThe farmers should be utilized as far as possible in the purchasing\r\nand sales department, and should divide into committees to try\r\nvarious experiments connected with their business, that through\r\ntheir reports all may be benefited by the knowledge gained. Dairying\r\nand large orchards on land suitable and not of use in the general\r\nfarming plan could be conducted by the community, each farmer being\r\na stockholder. The labor performed on these cooperative undertakings\r\nshould be paid for and charged to cost of production, each one who\r\nperforms a share of the labor participating in the profits as near\r\nas may be. As money is received by the company from products, it can\r\nbe used in similar operations. When the farms are paid for, the\r\nfarmers can continue the cooperative features that experience has\r\nproved useful and extend the business principle to other fields,\r\nsuch as heating, light, and power by electricity, machinery for\r\npreparing products for market, drying, canning, etc., as well as for\r\nthe cultivation of the soil.\r\n\r\nWhere the land is level the farms can be laid out on a general plan\r\nthat will admit of the use of steam plows to reduce the cost of\r\nplowing, save hard labor, and reduce the number of work animals.\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of advantages the individual would have in these\r\ncommunities, social, educational, and economic, health and physical\r\ndevelopment appear as not the least.\r\n\r\nThe farm, as it is, still furnishes a horde of recruits for insane\r\nasylums; its isolation and monotony of everyday life, with its lack\r\nof social intercourse and educational advantages, nearly\r\ncounterbalance the strain and poverty of the cities.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest difficulty is the growing inability of the farmers'\r\nsons to secure land and the means to cultivate it when they arrive\r\nat a marriageable age. Those who have seen for threescore years the\r\never-increasing flow of boys and girls from the farms to the cities,\r\ngreater in proportion to the rural population than in any other age,\r\nrealize the necessity for aid in this direction. While it is true\r\nthat the farm has contributed largely to the numbers of our\r\nsuccessful city men, the fact remains that the mass of boys who come\r\nto the cities as well as the city born, lack the faculty to grab or\r\nsave, and fail, while the healthy girls swell the ranks of\r\nprostitution, where an average of eight years lands them in a\r\npauper's grave.\r\n\r\nOur soldiers, as well as those of other countries, are not up to\r\nformer physical standards. Degeneracy, disintegration is apparent in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nThe power of a nation depends on the physical and mental condition\r\nof the great mass of people, and to leave the people in ignorance\r\nthat they may be controlled by the intelligent few who understand\r\ntheir needs and may have their welfare at heart, is a mistake that\r\nother nations than Russia have made. The law of the survival of the\r\nfittest has wiped out races and nations who have ignored this\r\nfundamental law, that all men must progress together.\r\n\r\nA race or civilization with such a basis of farmers as this plan\r\nwould create would be enduring.\r\n\r\nThe nation or race, like the individual, must have intelligent\r\norganization and live in harmony with the laws of nature in order to\r\nsurvive. Opposition to them means destruction Cooperation is\r\nconstructive.\r\n\r\nIf we are to profit by this lesson, it is necessary that we improve\r\nthe conditions surrounding our lower classes. That this is\r\nrecognized by a large number of leading minds is proved by the\r\nefforts of the many who are engaged in educational and other social\r\nmovements, most of which result in little net good to the\r\nwage-earners.\r\n\r\nObstacles to small farming near large cities are that farms of three\r\nto ten acres with buildings are not plentiful, and that mortgage\r\nloans are hard to get in the East and loans to help in building are\r\nhardly to be had at all.\r\n\r\nLand is either held intact as large farms or is sold entire to\r\nspeculators who hold it until it can be divided into city lots.\r\nHere, it would seem, is an opportunity for those who are interested\r\nin bettering the condition of their fellow men by wholesale, and can\r\ninvest large capital, but little time, in the work.\r\n\r\nLet them buy up land in large acreages and cut it up into small\r\nplots of from one to ten acres, charging enough advance to return\r\ninterest on the money invested and to meet the necessary expenses in\r\nsuch operation. Then make liberal building loans to buyers.\r\nInquiries among real estate men show that they always have a larger\r\ndemand for small acreage than they can meet, so an immediate market\r\nwith large profits would await those who are first in this field.\r\n\r\nThere is no use in blaming people for not leaving the cities to go\r\nto the farms; they don't know enough to go, they don't know enough\r\nto make a living if they do go, and they don't know enough to enjoy\r\nit. Besides this, they have not the capital. We must teach them and\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Maxwell's Homecrofters' Guild at Watertown, Mass., where\r\nboys are taught what to do with the earth and how to do it, is worth\r\nwhole shelves of books on \"The Exodus to the Cities\" or the\r\n\"Prosperity of the Settler.\"\r\n\r\nIt is reported that the state of Texas offered six million acres of\r\nland for sale to settlers, at one dollar per acre. It has been\r\nsuggested that it would be better that the states should rent out\r\nthe land at four per cent of the sale price. This would leave more\r\nmoney in the hands of settlers and enable many to get farms who\r\ncannot pay the price and have enough left to raise a crop. In\r\nreality it would be better for the state to help farmers get a start\r\nrather than to tax them one dollar per acre to begin with. However,\r\nunder our system of government, we permit only those who have money\r\nto have land.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the state of Texas and her people would\r\nbe better off if the land were leased than to have it sold. Probably\r\na tax on the value of the land instead of a rent would be the best\r\nfor all the people, especially as it would check speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE COMING PROFESSION FOR BOYS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that as little as possible may seem to be taken for granted\r\nor as mere expressions of the opinions of the author, we cite the\r\nviews of specialists as to the possibilities of this field, so new\r\nin this country, of intensive agriculture.\r\n\r\nThese will show that the conviction has become general that, as\r\nworkers, as teachers, and as discoverers, there is no career more\r\ninviting or more lucrative or more dignified than that of the\r\nskillful foster-father of plants.\r\n\r\n\"Children brought up in city tenements tend to become vicious and\r\nsickly, but if transported to country homes they may grow up strong\r\nand self-respecting men and women.\r\n\r\n\"There are hundreds of applicants for every position in the cities,\r\nand competition forces the pay down to the lowest level. Living\r\nexpenses are heavier. The risk to health from sedentary occupations,\r\nlong hours in ill-ventilated offices, stores, and workshops is\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n\"There are few inducements to out-door exercise. Even if he lives at\r\nhome, the boy who is forced to the street or into the factory before\r\nhe has the strength or education to do good work remains an\r\nunskilled worker all his life.\r\n\r\n\"Manufacturing is upon a larger and larger scale. The division of\r\nlabor is greater and greater. Not only does the gulf between\r\ncapitalist and laborer widen, but with it the gulf between skilled\r\nand unskilled labor.\" (\"What Shall Our Boys Do for a Living?\"\r\nCharles F. Wingate.)\r\n\r\nIt is the city that breeds or attracts most of the pauperism and\r\ncrime. The country has its own healthy life.\r\n\r\nEvery one is born with some natural gift, and it is a good thing to\r\ndiscover early in life what one's natural gifts are so that each may\r\nbe educated in the direction suited to natural capacity.\r\n\r\nHow are you to treat a lad who has naturally an inclination for the\r\nwork on the farm? In the first place do not provide him with any\r\nspending money unless he earns it. The prime thing necessary is to\r\ngive the boy a personal interest in what is going on upon the farm.\r\nGive him a plot of land as his own, let him understand that anything\r\nhe may grow upon this land shall belong to him, but do not give him\r\nthis plot and say, \"There, take that; do as you like with it,\" he\r\nwill wonder what to do with it. He will need somebody to help him by\r\nteaching him what he is to do. Enter into a partnership with him at\r\nthe start, give him some instruction as to what it is best for him\r\nto do with his plot. Find out his inclinations; give him sympathy\r\nand help. Bring out his natural aptitude for farming life, teach him\r\nmethod in his work; teach him to think his way out; and, best of\r\nall, teach him to work for definite results; that is what is wanted\r\nin any line of life, especially in farm life.\r\n\r\nLet the work of the boy have a meaning and a purpose. Let him\r\nunderstand that certain results cannot be accomplished in any other\r\nway, and give him chances to go outside and see what other people\r\nare doing. Let him see good scientific agriculture and be encouraged\r\nto pursue such methods.\r\n\r\nProvide for him the very best reading that can be found in\r\nagricultural journals and books. Let him have three or four years at\r\nan agricultural college. All the influences there point to\r\nagriculture as the best calling for a young man who is fit for it,\r\nwhereas in other colleges the influences are all in the opposite\r\ndirection. At our agricultural colleges a youth has all the\r\nnecessary advantages of general education, and also an education in\r\nthe lines fitting him especially for the calling he has selected.\r\n(United States Department of Agriculture, Bulletin 138, condensed.)\r\n\r\n\"Among farmers and gardeners not enough thought is given to the whys\r\nand wherefores, or cause and effect; as a rule, they go on year\r\nafter year without profiting by the personal opportunity afforded\r\nthem of observation, or by the results of experiments at scientific\r\nstations.\r\n\r\n\"With rare exceptions the young farmer and gardener takes up his\r\nwork, not from the scientific side, but strictly from the labor\r\nside; and he begins at the bottom, meeting the same difficulties as\r\ndid his father and too often not acquiring information beyond what\r\nhis father possessed.\r\n\r\n\"This should not be; agriculture should be taught in all our public\r\nschools in country districts, as it has been taught for years in\r\nGermany and Austria. It should be elevated as an art; in its higher\r\nestate it is already an art. No pursuit possesses a greater scope\r\nfor development; the field is almost unoccupied by leaders,\r\nscientific and practical.\" (Burnett Landreth, in _999 Queries and\r\nAnswers._)\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these ideas, the Baron de Hirsch Agricultural\r\nSchool at Woodbine, New Jersey, is giving practical courses in\r\nagriculture to Jewish boys, on the principle of individual\r\nplots--all free where necessary.\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the State Agricultural College of New Jersey, at New\r\nBrunswick, have established winter courses in agriculture, open to\r\nall residents of New Jersey over sixteen years of age. Courses will\r\nbe for twelve weeks, and only a small entrance fee is required; few\r\nbooks will be needed.\r\n\r\nOther states are doing likewise; all will need many teachers and\r\nexperimenters. At present all who know anything about intensive\r\nagriculture are snapped up by the numerous government experiment\r\nstations at good salaries. The land like that of the Rockefellers,\r\nthe Paynes, the Cuttings, on which farming is carried on by\r\nunnecessarily expensive methods, needs the services of trained\r\nagriculturists and professional foresters. The Division of Forestry\r\nat the start employed eleven persons, but now it has in the field as\r\nmany hundreds of employees, including a lot of trained foresters.\r\n\r\nThe railroads also see the profit in teaching farming, and are\r\ndevoting more and more money to experiments and lectures to show the\r\nfarmers that they can get more and better crops with the same effort\r\nby intelligent selection of seeds.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railway Company ran its first\r\nSeed and Soil Special over the entire system in the winter of\r\n1904-1905, and has lectured to hundreds of thousands of farmers\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThey report to us that \"there is no doubt that the lectures did a\r\ngreat deal of good, and necessarily the larger increase of crops\r\nwhich followed is due to the scientific methods of farming expounded\r\nby the various professors.\" The late President James J. Hill wrote\r\nmuch about the small farms' large yields.\r\n\r\nThe hundreds of thousands of \"war gardens\" unskillfully conducted\r\nand glutting the local markets with crops all matured at about the\r\nsame local time will unreasonably disgust many with intensive\r\ncultivation, especially those who work but do not think. The remedy\r\nis more instruction. The effect the agricultural colleges and\r\nexperiment stations is plain to the eye in the better appearance of\r\nfarms as we near the centers of instruction.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a clergyman published a book upon the Adirondacks; it\r\nwas full of poetry, and he sent men up there who afterwards became\r\nknown as \"Murray's Fools.\" They knew nothing about the life and had\r\nno suitability and little preparation for it. We do not wish to\r\nbring out a crop of \"Three Acres and Liberty Fools.\" We are telling\r\nwhat has been done and what can be done again. It does not follow\r\nthat every man can or will do it, much less teach it or advance the\r\nart, but the field is a large one and holds out great promise to\r\nthose who persevere and excel in it.\r\n\r\nIf any one thinks that the profit of the earth will come to the\r\ncultivator without very intelligent and steady work, he is mistaken.\r\nNo owner of land, unless others require it to live upon, can make\r\nmoney by neglecting it.\r\n\r\nSays _Maxwell's Talisman:_ \"The greatest good that can be done to\r\nthe American farmer to-day is to teach him to make the greatest\r\npossible profit from the smallest tract of land from which a family\r\ncan be supported in comfort. A great influence operating to-day\r\nagainst keeping the boys in the country is that the boy does not\r\nhave money enough to buy a farm. It is unfortunately true that in\r\nsome places there is a trend in the direction of absorbing farms\r\ninto still larger farms with a consequent diminution of population,\r\nas in Iowa and other sections. The remedy for this is to demonstrate\r\nthat if the value is in the boy rather than in the farm, and the boy\r\nis taught intensive, diversified, scientific farming, a good living\r\nwith a surplus profit that will provide amply for old age, may be\r\nmade from a comparatively small tract of land. The tract may be,\r\nsay, ten acres, with ample cultivation, irrigation, and\r\nfertilization, or even without irrigation because a hoe and a\r\ncultivator in the hands of a scientific farmer may bring as good and\r\nbetter results in providing moisture for growing plants as can be\r\nhad from a ditch and unlimited water in the hands of an ignorant\r\nfarmer.\"\r\n\r\nThe field of discovery is always limitless, and it is to those boys\r\nor girls who devote their attention to this that the greatest return\r\nwill come. \"What a fine thing it would be to find even one plant\r\nfree from rust in the midst of a rusted field. It would mean a\r\nrust-resistant plant. Its off-spring would probably be also rust\r\nresistant. If you should ever find such a plant, be sure to save its\r\nseed and plant in a plot by itself. The next year again save seed\r\nfrom those plants least rusted. Possibly you can develop a rust\r\nproof race of wheat! Keep your eyes open.\" (\"Agriculture for\r\nBeginners,\" by Burkett, Stevens, and Hill, pages 76-78.) So you may\r\npluck gain out of loss.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do experiments, the influence of ether on plants is\r\none new and wonderful field. It seems to induce artificial rest, so\r\nthat lilacs, for instance, can be made to bloom twice by a\r\ntreatment, the last time near Christmas.\r\n\r\nE. V. Wilcox says in _Farming_ that in 1899 a small quantity of\r\ndurum or macaroni wheat was introduced into this country for trial.\r\nIt was found profitable in localities where there was too little\r\nrain for ordinary wheat. Six years later, 20,000,000 bushels per\r\nyear of the wheat was grown in the United States. Its production has\r\nincreased greatly every season and has added materially to the total\r\nof the wheat crop.. Thorough fall cultivation has been found to\r\nincrease the yield, and in some parts of the wheat belt one in five\r\nof the farmers has already adopted the practice. In certain states\r\nwhere manuring has been thought unnecessary, experiments have\r\ndemonstrated that the yield may be increased 60 per cent by this\r\nsimple practice. The wheat production of Nebraska was increased more\r\nthan 10,000,000 bushels by the introduction of a hardy strain of\r\nTurkey red wheat. Swedish select oats in Wisconsin have greatly\r\naugmented the oat yield of the state. In 1899 six pounds of the seed\r\nwas brought to the state and from this small beginning a crop of\r\n9,000,000 bushels was harvested five years later.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gideon, of Minnesota, planted many apple seeds, and from them\r\nall raised one tree that was very fruitful, finely flavored, and\r\nable to withstand the cold Minnesota winter. This tree he multiplied\r\nby grafts and named it the Wealthy apple. It is said that in this\r\none apple he benefited the world to the value of more than one\r\nmillion dollars. You must not let any valuable bud or seed variant\r\nbe lost.\" (\"Agriculture for Beginners,\" page 61.)\r\n\r\n\"This fact ought to be very helpful to us next year when planting\r\ncorn. We should plant seed secured only from stalks that produced\r\nthe most corn. If we follow this plan year by year, each acre of\r\nland will be made to produce more kernels and hence a larger crop of\r\ncorn, and yet no more expense will be required to raise the crop.\"\r\n(Same, page 71.)\r\n\r\n_The World's Work_ tells how the country got a new industry.\r\n\r\nMr. George Gibbs, of Clearbrook, Wash., has made his \"stake\" by\r\ngrowing tulip and hyacinth bulbs. He had a little place on Orcas\r\nIsland, in Puget Sound. He did not know anything about growing\r\nflowers, but he did know that certain varieties of bulbs brought\r\ngood prices in the East. He was observant enough to see that the\r\nmoist, warm, climate and rich soil of the Puget Sound country were\r\npeculiarly favorable to flowers.\r\n\r\nHe had bad luck with his bulbs; that only meant that he still had\r\nsomething to learn. He kept his nerve even when he went bankrupt.\r\nHis friends told him he was wasting time, but they could not shake\r\nhis faith.\r\n\r\nIn twelve years he found that he was right. His wonderful gardens\r\nwere making him rich. Other men have gone into the business, but he\r\nwas first and has kept his lead. He has made the Puget Sound country\r\nthe greatest rival of Holland in the sale of flowering bulbs.\r\n\r\nQuantities of wild herbs, fruits, and roots that no one eats are\r\ngood; the Jesuits had a list of over two hundred kinds that the\r\nIndians ate, but it was lost. Some one can do a great service by\r\nmaking it up again by research and experiment. Thousands more of the\r\nwild things must be good for dyes, fabrics, and fodder.\r\n\r\nFame like Burbank's and fortune awaits the one who is a good\r\nself-advertiser and can find the use of the poetic daisies,\r\ngoldenrod, and thistle, the all-pervading \"pusley,\" and such other\r\nvegetable vermin.\r\n\r\nAn interesting experiment is conducted in growing tea with colored\r\nchild labor, at Tea, South Carolina, by the aid of education and\r\nmachinery and the cooperation of the Agricultural Department at\r\nWashington, who will furnish particulars. Whatever may be its\r\noutcome, this will give an opening to some intelligent cultivators,\r\nand it points the way to other fields.\r\n\r\nThose who are first in raising new or improved plants find a waiting\r\nmarket for them.\r\n\r\n_The Market Growers Gazette,_ of London, England, reports that Mr.\r\nA. Findlay, Mairsland, Auchtermuchty, Scotland, sold one season to\r\nfive leading growers whose names are given five seed potatoes at\r\nL 20 each (which would be, perhaps, $500 a peck). He says\r\nenthusiastically: \"It is as perfectly round-shaped a potato as can\r\nbe imagined. There is a slight dash of pink on the outer rim of the\r\neye. My stock of it is very small, only 126 lb. and I do not care to\r\nsell any. If next year's crop yields as well as this year's, we\r\nshall have twenty times that quantity.\" Mr. Findlay has other seed\r\npotatoes, just as high priced, for which he wants $125 per lb.,\r\nwhich, he says, \"means that I do not want to sell any.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows what progressive people think of the real value of good\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that \"The land on which these are grown is\r\nnot highly manured; the only artificial manure that it has received\r\nis about 200 lb. of potash per acre. It has the drawback of being\r\nrather stony.\"\r\n\r\nOf course this is \"a fad\"; it is doubtful if it will pay any one to\r\ngive such prices for seed except to sell to some bigger fool than\r\nhimself. Of course, also, the market for a particular fancy thing\r\nmay soon be overstocked, but it seems to be a nice thing for the\r\nFindlays meanwhile, and it does good in teaching people to\r\nappreciate good things.\r\n\r\nYet the average potato patcher prudently saves his small potatoes\r\nfor next year's seed, which is just as if a breeder were to keep the\r\ncolts that were too poor to sell, to be the parents of his herd.\r\n\r\nIn the dark ages of farming--to wit, in 1881, for this is a true\r\nstory--a minister of the Gospel came into possession, by\r\ninheritance, of a fifteen-acre farm a short way from Philadelphia.\r\nHe found the soil a reddish, somewhat gravelly clay, and so worn out\r\nfrom years of cropping that it did not support two cows and a horse.\r\nCity born and bred, he was encumbered with no knowledge of\r\nagriculture which had to be unlearned. He began a careful and\r\nsystematic study of the agricultural literature, and ultimately\r\ndeveloped a novel system of dairy farming to which he adhered\r\nreligiously.\r\n\r\nThe farm Iying near the city is high-priced land; for this reason,\r\nand because of the limited acreage, the cows were kept in the barn\r\nthe year round. For six years his bill for veterinary services was\r\n$1.50, while the income from the milk of his seventeen cows was\r\nabout $2400 a year. In addition, from four to six head of young\r\ncattle were sold annually, netting about $500 a year. As the stock\r\non the farm was stall fed every particle of plant food contained in\r\nthe stable manure, liquid as well as solid, was utilized. No\r\nfertilizer was ever purchased. Yet all of the \"roughage\" for thirty\r\nhead of stock was raised on the thirteen acres of available soil.\r\nOnly $625 a year was expended for concentrated feeding stuffs. The\r\nnet earnings of the farm for the period averaged more than $1000 a\r\nyear. And this was during the early days of his experience; later he\r\nmade more.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. J. Spillman, of the Agricultural Department, visited\r\nhim in 1903, and studied the methods employed. Then, he says, the\r\nrush to see the farm became so great that the owner had to give it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nFew people who know nothing about it, and won't learn, can take even\r\nthree acres and make anything off it. To get the phenomenal yields\r\ntakes capital--sometimes large capital, wisely spent. Sometimes we\r\nread of immense products \"per acre\"; this often means the product of\r\na single rod of ground, this gives at the rate of so much \"per\r\nacre,\" or might, if extended.\r\n\r\nBut any one can take a little bit of ground and use it thoroughly\r\nand increase his borders and his knowledge as he goes on. He will\r\nfind plenty to pay him for doing or teaching whatever he has learned\r\nto do that no one else has done \"If a man make but a mousetrap\r\nbetter than his fellows, though he makes his tent in the wilderness,\r\nthe world will beat a path to his door.\"\r\n\r\nThe mission of this book is accomplished if it interests you to\r\nconsider the possibilities of making a living on a few acres and\r\nleads you to investigate. It is not written as a textbook, for, as\r\nhas been shown, there are authorities enough cited to supply all the\r\ntechnical information needed.\r\n\r\nIts sole object is to show what has been done and what can be done\r\non small areas and to show that life in the country need not be so\r\nlaborious if the same methods are used which make successes of\r\nbusiness in other lines.\r\n\r\nIf it does this and is the means of checking in any degree the\r\nreckless trend of people from the country to the cities, the author\r\nwill feel that his efforts have been well repaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE WOOD LOT\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have a bit of woods on your little farm, take care of it. By\r\nintelligent thinning you can make an average income of five dollars\r\nper acre from ordinary second growth wild woods. The cord wood,\r\nbarrel hoops, fence posts, and so on will decrease your expenses,\r\nwhile the timber will increase in value. That lot is the place to\r\nstart your boy as a forester.\r\n\r\nInstructions how to treat the trees can be obtained from your State\r\nForestry Department or from the National Forest Service at\r\nWashington: the care of growing timber is a big subject and requires\r\nstudy, but don't sell your standing timber without their advice.\r\nForestry can hardly be made to pay on a small lot with hired labor\r\nor hired teams, and you must not pay much for your wood lot, else\r\ninterest and taxes will eat up the returns.\r\n\r\nTo be of high quality, timber must be, to a considerable proportion\r\nof its height, free of limbs, which are the cause of knots; it must\r\nbe tall; and it must not decrease rapidly in diameter from the butt\r\nto the top of the last log. In a dense stand of timber there is very\r\ngreat competition for sunlight among the individual trees, with the\r\nresult that height growth is increased. Trees in crowded stands are\r\ntaller than those in uncrowded stands of the same age. When the\r\ntrees are crowded so that sunlight does not reach the lower\r\nbranches, these soon die and become brittle they then fall off or\r\nare broken off by the wind, snow, or other agencies. By this process\r\ntrunks are formed which are free from limbs, and hence of high\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that trees in the wood lot should be so\r\ncrowded that the crown or top of each individual tree may be in\r\ncontact with those of its nearest neighbors. A crowded stand of\r\ntrees produces not only a larger number but also a greater\r\nproportion of high quality sawlogs than an uncrowded stand. So vital\r\na matter is their forest shade that it does not do to set out young\r\ntrees which have grown in the forest. Ordinarily, the exposure to\r\nthe sunlight stunts them and often kills them. Nursery trees are\r\nbest; the next best are trees that have grown at the edge of the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe actual value of woodland as pasture is small. One dollar per\r\nacre per year is probably a liberal estimate of the value of its\r\nforage. Thrifty fully stocked stands of timber will grow at the rate\r\nof 250 or more board feet of lumber per year. Adopting only 250\r\nboard feet as the growth and assuming the value of the standing\r\ntimber to be from $5 to $8 per 1000 feet board measure, the value of\r\nthe timber growth is from $1.25 to $2 per acre per year.\r\n\r\nIf the timber is given good care, moreover, the growth should be as\r\nmuch as 500 board feet per acre per year. The larger value of the\r\nwood lot for growing timber, as compared to the value of its forage\r\nonly, is therefore apparent.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought possible to secure this growth of timber and\r\nutilize the wood lot for pasture at the same time, because the stock\r\neat the seedlings and damage the trees.\r\n\r\nIf shade, however, rather than forage is the wood lot's chief value\r\nto stock, it can doubtless be provided by allowing the stock to\r\nrange in only a portion of the lot. The remainder can more\r\nprofitably be devoted to the production of wood.\r\n\r\nOwners are doubtless in some instances indifferent about fires in\r\ntheir wood lots, because they do not realize that these may do great\r\nharm without giving striking evidence of the fact. They burn the\r\nfallen leaves and accumulated litter of several years, thus\r\ndestroying the material with which trees enrich their own soil. The\r\nsoil becomes exposed, evaporation is greater, and more of the rain\r\nand melted snow runs off the surface. The roots may also be exposed\r\nand burned. The vitality of the trees is weakened and their rate of\r\ngrowth decreased. Don't burn leaves or waste growth: it is dangerous\r\nand they are valuable for mulch and for manure.\r\n\r\nIt has been found in the prairie region that through the protection\r\nafforded by the most efficient grove windbreaks, the yield in farm\r\ncrops is increased to the extent of a crop as large as could be\r\ngrown on a strip three times as wide as the height of the trees.\r\n\r\nAt present the following states maintain nurseries and distribute\r\nyoung trees either free or practically at cost to planters within\r\nthe state: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Maryland,\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Dakota, and Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe names of nurseries which handle stock of certain trees and their\r\nquoted prices for all the more important species can be secured from\r\nthe Forest Service, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nWhether your wood lot pays a profit or not, like the profit from the\r\nrest of your land, depends largely on how it is taxed. The higher it\r\nis taxed the harder it is to make it pay. In most states timberland\r\nis assessed on the basis of its value, timber and land together.\r\nWoodland assessed on this basis is overtaxed as compared with land\r\nassessed on the basis of what it produces each year. The value of\r\nplowland for farm purposes is established by what it will earn. If\r\nthe owner can make $10 an acre a year over all expenses by growing\r\nsay wheat, corn, cotton or alfalfa on it, his land will have a value\r\nof perhaps $150 an acre. If it took two years to grow a crop, the\r\nland would be worth only half as much. Its owner in that case would\r\nkick vigorously if he could not get his assessment lowered. He would\r\nkick still more vigorously if he had to pay a tax also on the value\r\nof the standing crop, after having to pay too much on the land. \"The\r\nLord loveth a cheerful kicker.\"\r\n\r\nWith woodland the case is still worse. Each year the owner may have\r\nto pay a tax on the merchantable crops of many past years. It is as\r\nthough the owner of plowland had to pay a tax on the value of his\r\nfield crops twice a week throughout the growing season. When a\r\nfull-grown tree is cut down or burned up in a forest fire, it may\r\nhave been taxed 40 or 50 times over. Each year the land on which it\r\ngrew has been valued not on the basis of its earning power, but on\r\nthe basis of what it would bring if sold, timber and all. A tax\r\nlevied on the income-earning value of the land would be much more\r\nequitable.\r\n\r\nCertain states have applied this principle by legislation under\r\nwhich land to be used for growing timber can be classified so that\r\nthe timber can be taxed separately from the land. The land there is\r\ntaxed annually on its value, without timber. The tax on the timber\r\nis not paid until the crop is harvested. It is therefore a tax on\r\nthe yield. In New York this yield tax is 5 per cent of the value of\r\nthe crop harvested; Michigan 5 per cent of it; Massachusetts 6 per\r\ncent; and Vermont, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania 10 per cent, with\r\ndifferent provisions for forests already established.\r\n\r\nSuch a method is much better than that adopted by a number of states\r\nwhich exempt, under certain conditions, reforested or reforesting\r\nlands for a term of years, or allow rebates or bounties on such\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe profit of a growing forest crop will depend largely on relief\r\nfrom excessive taxation. It is unthrifty public policy to discourage\r\nputting waste land to work. (\"The Farm Woodlot Problem,\" by Herbert\r\nA. Smith, Editor Forest Service--from Yearbook of Department of\r\nAgriculture for 1914.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSOME PRACTICAL EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture at Washington, also Cornell University\r\nand various other schools publish special studies and monographs of\r\ndifferent branches. For some a small charge is made, but they are\r\nmostly distributed free. Many of them are very valuable. The United\r\nStates Department's pamphlet on the Diseases of the Violet is a\r\nnotable example. The average person does not know how these can be\r\nobtained or even that they exist.\r\n\r\nThe Department's Year Books are most interesting reading, and both\r\nits Professors and the state colleges will answer particular\r\nquestions of citizens.\r\n\r\nThese and the various United States and State Experiment Station\r\npublications will serve instead of most books (except this one), if\r\nproperly filed, indexed, and crossindexed so that you can readily\r\nturn to all the information on a given subject--on bugs, for\r\ninstance, before the insects have harvested your crop.\r\n\r\nI am trying only to suggest things, not to advise, nor to induce my\r\nreaders to try to do anything that they don't like or have no\r\ncapacity for. It is difficult to make people understand that.\r\n\r\nOne reader of this book, a dear creature, wrote her experience for a\r\nCrafts magazine. She got the acres, built her house, and raised one\r\nfine crop of--swans? nuts grafted on wild trees? partridge berries?\r\nNo--three tons of hay!\r\n\r\nShe called it \"Three Acres and Starving\"; I called it \"Three\r\nAcres and Stupidity.\" She didn't eat the hay, and the Editor\r\nwouldn't publish my reply.\r\n\r\nEverybody raises hay and potatoes; so don't you raise any unless for\r\nyour own use.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are a laborious crop, requiring constant care, manuring,\r\ncutting the seed eyes (on which there is much uncertain lore),\r\nhilling up or down according to drainage and rainfall, spraying with\r\nPyrox or dusting with Paris green, and, neither least nor last, bug\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\nThe seed is expensive, but for your own use you may plant from\r\nwhatever seed, otherwise wasted, may grow on the potato vine, on the\r\ntops of the plants. The crop will be small potatoes and all kinds of\r\nvarieties, which won't sell in the market but which make each dinner\r\na surprise party. You may strike a new and improved strain, though\r\nthere are over a thousand varieties of potato listed already. New\r\ncreations of merit bring good returns, and 'tis the enterprising\r\nexperimenter that reaps the honor and the harvest, and he is worthy\r\nof his reward.\r\n\r\nTo select the most productive plants and breed again from these is,\r\nhowever, a more promising profit plan. Even then don't plant the\r\ntubers unless you will take the pains to soak the seed potatoes in\r\nscab preventer. If you won't, likely you will raise mostly scab, and\r\nthe spores thereof will spoil your ground for potatoes for years.\r\n\r\nIt costs little in money to make it--half a pint of formalin to\r\nfifteen gallons of water. Not guessed but measured gallons. Then\r\nsoak for an hour and a half by the Ingersoll. Don't reckon that one\r\nlittle hour or a few will do just as well. With one hour they will\r\nbe under-done and spotty, with three over-done and weakly.\r\n\r\nThere is lots to be discovered yet about \"the spuds.\" Sawdust is an\r\nexcellent mulch for them, as for small fruits. When you store any\r\nseeds to plant, put carbolic moth balls with them. It checks insects\r\nand mice and helps to protect the planted seeds from birds.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, with potatoes and with other things that you want\r\ngood and plenty, get specific directions and follow them. Most\r\npeople won't read directions; more can't follow them. Those people\r\nhave their knives out for \"book farmers and professors,\" but you\r\ncan't improve on experience and experiment by the light of laziness\r\nor of nature.\r\n\r\nA delicate jelly is made out of the red outer pulp of rose berries.\r\nIt would be romantic to develop a Rose fruit from those seed pods,\r\nas the peach was developed from the almond. We have invented\r\nstranger fruits than that, such as the Logan-berry and the pomato.\r\n\r\nBut there is better chance for profit in doing the old things\r\nbetter, especially when the experiment costs little or nothing.\r\n\r\nYou can have a strawberry garden on your roof or even on a balcony.\r\nThis need not be costly. Clinch all the nails on the inside of a\r\nstout barrel. Bore half a dozen two-inch holes in the bottom, or put\r\nin a layer of stones, for drainage. Bore a row of eight holes about\r\neight inches from the bottom of the barrel and about eight inches\r\napart. Eight inches above this bore a second row of holes\r\n\"staggered,\" and a third eight inches above those. Pile several old\r\ntomato cans with perforated bottoms one on the other in the center\r\nof the barrel: these should be the height of the barrel and placed\r\nupright in its middle. This is the conductor down which water should\r\nbe poured at intervals before the soil gets quite dry. Fill the\r\nbarrel with soil made of one half loam and one half well-rotted\r\nmanure. Be sure the manure is not fresh. A little bone meal is a\r\ngood addition.\r\n\r\nNow plant the first row of strawberry plants (\"ever-bearing\" are\r\nbest, though they don't ever-bear). Put each plant inside, spread\r\nthe roots, and pull the leaves of each out through one of the holes.\r\nPress the soil down firmly around each root. Repeat the process for\r\nthe other two rows; fill the barrel and set say six plants on the\r\ntop. That will give you thirty plants, which should grow ten to\r\ntwenty-five quarts of fine berries, or more. The illustration makes\r\nthe holes twelve inches apart--for big leafy plants.\r\n\r\nIf there are any more, those will be you. Anyhow, you will know a\r\nlot about strawberries at the end of the season. Other things can be\r\ngrown in the same way.\r\n\r\nBetter than growing vegetables, or where dry land can't be obtained,\r\nis to raise some crop like water cress that usually comes from a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nOften an otherwise poor season will help a specialty. One year wet\r\nweather jumped the price of mint and it sold at double prices. Hot,\r\ndry weather is required to make it produce its best.\r\n\r\nMost of the mint produced in this country for peppermint oil is\r\ngrown in Michigan. More than 4000 acres are reported from a single\r\ncounty. Mint oil is worth about $3.50 a pound and costs about a\r\ndollar to produce. Nice bright dried leaves sell for about 15 cent\r\na pound.\r\n\r\nThe production of mint is sometimes as high as fifty pounds of oil\r\nto the acre. The bulk of it is grown on marshlands, which a few\r\nyears ago were nowhere worth more than a few dollars an acre. The\r\nmint is sent to the manufacturers, where it is purified and made\r\ninto flavoring extract or used in chewing gum, etc.\r\n\r\nWhy should we, with our infinite variety of climates, soils, and\r\nlabor, import from England the coarser varieties of seeds of the\r\ncabbage family, savoy, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, or kale? We owe\r\nEngland enough already for the seed of Liberty we got from her.\r\nCalifornia now supplies some seed for onions, carrots, parsnips, and\r\na few others. The finest cauliflower comes mostly from Denmark now.\r\n\r\nTurnip seed, too, mangel-wurzel and swedes, onion, pea, bean,\r\ncarrot, parsnip, radish, and beet seeds could be grown here by the\r\nsame skill, care, and training as they are grown abroad.\r\n\r\nAn interesting method of forcing plants by the use of hot water\r\nbaths is described in _La Nature_ (Paris), by Henri Coupin. The\r\nprocess is much simpler than others now in use and may be employed\r\nby any one who has a small greenhouse, no expert treatment being\r\nnecessary. Says Mr. Coupin:\r\n\r\n\"Most trees in our countries undergo a period of rest, during which\r\nall growth appears to be suspended. Branches do not enlarge and the\r\nbuds on them remain as they are. They do not arouse from their\r\ntorpor until spring, first, because they then find the conditions\r\nnecessary for their development, and again, because, during the\r\nperiod of rest, chemical changes have taken place in them. These are\r\nindispensable, because if they did not occur, the trees, even in the\r\nmost favorable conditions, would not open their buds. For example,\r\nplant branches that have quite recently dropped their leaves, in a\r\nwarm greenhouse. They will not bud; but make the same experiment at\r\nthe end of several months and the buds will appear.\r\n\r\n\"There are several ways of shortening this period of rest, some of\r\nwhich are rather odd. The best known is the process of\r\netherification, which has been so much discussed recently, and which\r\nconsists in placing the plants to be forced in the vapor of ether or\r\nchloroform for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Afterwards when\r\nplaced in a hothouse, the branches begin to develop almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\"A very ingenious botanist, Hans Molisch, professor in the\r\nUniversity of Prague, has devised a method of forcing, simpler still\r\nand quite as effective. It consists in plunging the branches into\r\nwarm water during a time that varies with the species. The best\r\nmethod is to plunge the plants in a reservoir of warm water, head\r\ndownward, without moistening the roots, which would injure them.\r\nAfter a certain time, the plants are withdrawn, turned right side up\r\nwith care, and placed in a greenhouse, where they develop at once.\r\n\r\n\"The duration of the warm bath should be nine to twelve hours at\r\nmost. The best temperature is 30 degree to 35 degree [86 degree to\r\n95 degree F] . . . That is to say, in the majority of cases, one may\r\nsimply employ the water available in hothouses, which is just at the\r\nproper temperature. The process is thus at the disposal of all\r\ngardeners.\r\n\r\n\"It should be said that the good effects of the hot baths are\r\nconfined to the parts actually immersed and do not extend to the\r\nwhole plant. Thus, on the same stem we may see developing only the\r\nbranches that have been treated with the bath, while the others\r\nremain torpid. This is easy to verify with the lilac or the willow.\r\n\r\n\"If Lobner is to be believed, we may substitute for the water bath\r\none of steam. He has obtained good results with the lily of the\r\nvalley. The thing is possible, but the method used by Molisch is\r\nmore practical.\r\n\r\n\"How shall we explain the good effect of warm water on branches in a\r\nresting state? We are absolutely ignorant of its mechanism, as we\r\nare also in the case of etherification. But if we knew everything,\r\nscience would be no longer amusing!\"--Condensed, from _THE LITERARY\r\nDIGEST._\r\n\r\nThere are many new uses for water: It will not be long before every\r\ntruck and every commercial flower garden will have overhead\r\nirrigation. This is merely gas pipes (\"seconds\" rejected for blow\r\nholes or porosity are usually used) supported on posts say six feet\r\nabove the ground. They are usually placed parallel about fifty feet\r\napart, which will make four to the acre square, and have a single\r\nrow of holes and a handle on each pipe, so that the spray can be\r\nturned in either direction; with a high-water pressure, often\r\nsupplied by gravity, they may be farther apart with larger holes.\r\n\r\nThese not only have saved us from fear of drought, but they supply\r\nthe moisture in the natural manner and at the right time and\r\nincrease fertility to an astonishing degree.\r\n\r\nWhen you take a shower bath yourself, that is overhead irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe gasoline, kerosene, or heavy oil one man farm tractor, so made\r\nthat it can be used to plow, to climb a side hill, to run a saw or a\r\npump, is the coming factor in garden and farm advance. Huge fortune\r\nawaits the first manufacturer who will standardize it, cheapen it,\r\nand specialize on it. The horse is the greatest care and the\r\ngreatest risk on the little farm. He costs more than a tractor\r\nwould, he is eating his head off half the time, he can't he worked\r\novertime without injury, not even as much as a man can be; all too\r\nsoon he dies, more missed than any member of the family.\r\n\r\nWhen this is popularized the \"Three Acres\" can well be extended to\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nSOME EXPERIMENTAL FOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTY-EIGHT years ago Abraham Lincoln said \"Population must increase\r\nrapidly, more rapidly than in former times, and ere long the most\r\nvaluable of all arts will be the art of deriving subsistence from\r\nthe smallest area of soil. No community whose every member possesses\r\nthis art can ever be the victim of oppression in any of its forms.\r\nSuch community will alike be independent of crowned kings, money\r\nkings, and land kings.\"\r\n\r\nThe future, it seems, has many strange dishes in store for the\r\nAmerican stomach. Whether you are rich or one of the plain people\r\nthat have to work, whether the idea of new fantastic food appeals to\r\nyour palate or to your pocketbook, you will be attracted by the\r\narray of foreign viands with curious names which have already been\r\nsuccessfully introduced and are now beginning to be marketed in this\r\ncountry. Mr. William N. Taft, in the Technical World Magazine,\r\npresents the following wild menu for the dinner table:\r\n\r\n  Jujube Soup\r\n  Brisket of Antelope\r\n  Boiled Petsai\r\n  Dasheen au Gratin\r\n  Creamed Udo\r\n  Soy Bean and Lichee Nut Salad\r\n  Yang Taw Pie\r\n  Mangoes\r\n  Kaki\r\n  Sake.\r\n\r\nThis, he assures us, is not the bill of fare of a Chinese eating\r\nhouse, nor yet of a Japanese restaurant, it is the daily meal of an\r\nAmerican family two decades hence, if the Department of Agriculture\r\nsucceeds in its attempt to introduce a large number of new foods to\r\nthis country for the dual purpose of supplying new dainties and\r\nreducing the cost of living. Uncle Sam has determined to decrease\r\nthe price of food as much as possible, and, for this purpose,\r\ndelegated Dr. David S. Fairchild, Agricultural Explorer in charge of\r\nthe Foreign Plant Section of the Bureau of Plant Industry, in\r\nparticular, to see what can be done about it.\r\n\r\nMore than 30,000 fruits and vegetables have been tested by Uncle\r\nSam's experts and, according to Dr. Fairchild, a goodly portion of\r\nthe foodstuffs which have been regarded as staples since the days of\r\nthe first settler are doomed. Consider for example \"Jujube Soup!\"\r\nMention that to the average person and he will answer:\r\n\r\n\"But I thought the jujube was a fruit, like an apple. How can you\r\nmake soup of it?\" The average person is right. The jujube is a\r\nfruit--but a most remarkable one.\r\n\r\n\"It is about the size and appearance of a crab apple, but contains\r\nonly a single seed. It grows on a spiny tree, long and bare of\r\ntrunk, with its foliage cropping out at the very top like a royal\r\npalm of the tropics. The jujube itself has been used for years to\r\nflavor candies and other confections. But the essence is very\r\nexpensive and comparatively rare, despite the profusion with which\r\nthe fruit grows in its native habitat.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Fairchild, however, imported several specimens for the\r\nDepartment's gardens in California, where they are bearing\r\nprolifically. The arid sands of the southwest, where nothing but\r\ncactus and sage-brush formerly would grow, have been found to be\r\nexcellent soil for the jujube, and it is the hope of Uncle Sam's\r\nfood experts to see the entire Arizona and New Mexico deserts dotted\r\nwith jujube orchards, with income to their owners. The jujube is\r\ndelicious eaten raw, but it may be cooked in any manner in which\r\napples are prepared, used as a sauce or for pie, preserved or dried.\r\nFinally, its juice may be used as a delicious and highly nutritive\r\nfruit broth.\"\r\n\r\nPetsai, or, as the Chinese have it, Pe-tsai, is a substitute for the\r\ncabbage. In appearance it is as different from cabbage as can be\r\nimagined. It is tall and cylindrical and its leaves are narrow,\r\ndelicately curled, with frilled edges. The petsai can, however, be\r\ngrown on any soil where the ordinary cabbage could be cultivated and\r\nin many sections where the native vegetable would languish. We are\r\ntold it is no uncommon thing for a petsai to reach sixty pounds in\r\nweight. Department of Agriculture officials, however, advise that it\r\nbe plucked when about eight pounds in weight, its flavor being then\r\nthe most delicate and appealing.\r\n\r\nThis new importation, Uncle Sam's experts hope, will cause a drop in\r\nthe price of dinners. Cabbage long ago ceased to be a cheap dish.\r\nBut petsai requires none of the care which has to be lavished on\r\ncabbage and will thrive in almost any climate and any soil.\r\n\r\nThe soy bean, once started, grows wild and yields several crops a\r\nseason. It can be prepared in a multitude of ways, from baking to a\r\ndelicious salad. According to Doctor Yamei Kin, the head of the\r\nWomen's Medical School near Pekin, milk can be made from it to cost\r\nabout six cents a quart and equal to cows' milk. It would be a\r\nblessing if we could get rid of the sacred but unclean cow. One of\r\nthe state dairy inspectors told me, \"We consider milk a filthy\r\nproduct.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that, only twenty years ago, almost all the\r\ndates consumed here came from the oases of Arabia and the valley of\r\nthe Euphrates. To-day there are more than a hundred varieties\r\nsuccessfully produced in California and Arizona. The wonders of\r\ntoday are the commonplaces of to-morrow, and there is no telling to\r\nwhat apparently impossible lengths science will go to relieve people\r\nof the burden they now bear in the price of food. It has scoured the\r\nends of the earth for new delicacies and now experts will do their\r\nbest to teach the people to use them.\r\n\r\nHave you ever heard of _\"Whitloof\"_ or _\"Belgian Chicory\"_ or have\r\nyou ever dined in one of the better restaurants of large city where\r\nthey have served during the winter months a salad composed of golden\r\nblanched oblong leaves about 2 inches wide and 5 inches long, only\r\nthe outer edges showing a faint green? It is as delicate as the\r\nperfume of roses, as crisp as young lettuce, as delicious as\r\nasparagus, and as ornamental upon the table as the freshest fruit.\r\n\r\nIn former years this salad had to be imported and you had to pay\r\ndear for a portion of it, a good reason why so few people know it. A\r\nBelgian farmer located near New York has grown many thousands of\r\nthese plants this past summer.\r\n\r\nHow would you like to grow this dainty salad right in your living\r\nroom and cut several crops from a single planting lasting nearly\r\nthree months? Secure an 8-inch pot and plant in it 12 roots packed\r\nin light sandy soil or pure sand. Invert another but empty 8-inch\r\npot over this to keep out the light, place in a heated room, water\r\ndaily, and in from three to four weeks you will find full-grown\r\ncrowns, beautifully blanched ready for cutting. Six of such crowns\r\nmake a large portion, sufficient for an entire family.\r\n\r\nIn cutting, do not cut too close to the root, for another growth is\r\nmade directly after the cutting, which matures in from three to four\r\nweeks, and still two other crops can be grown in this way, so that\r\nfrom a single planting four full crops can be had. Considering,\r\nthen, that eight such treats can be had for the cost of a single\r\ndozen roots, we can all now enjoy what was formerly a luxury. This\r\nmethod is most interesting, for you can watch the daily progress of\r\nthe growth of the roots, fascinating to young and old, and with\r\nthree weekly plantings of a pot each this treat can be enjoyed twice\r\na week from the 1st of February until May.\r\n\r\nFor those who wish to enjoy it more often or in larger quantities,\r\nwe suggest the following:\r\n\r\nPrepare a bed of soil 12 inches deep in your cellar in a dark place\r\nwhere the temperature is always above freezing. Plant the roots as\r\nclose as their size will permit and cover the crowns with at least 3\r\ninches of soil. On top of this put straw so that when the crowns\r\ncome through the soil they will not strike the light. When ready to\r\ncut, remove the soil as far back as the original root so that you\r\ncan intelligently cut the growth to produce the crops to follow.\r\n\r\nAs a substitute for the potato of commerce the \"Dasheen\" long ago\r\npassed the experimental stage. It has been served at a number of\r\nbanquets in Washington, Philadelphia, and New York.\r\n\r\nWhile the tops of potatoes are useless as food, the tops of the\r\ndasheen make delicious greens, and tests indicate that good growers\r\ncan depend on a crop of from four hundred to four hundred and fifty\r\nbushels per acre.\r\n\r\nThe Udo is the plant intended by the Department of Agriculture as a\r\nsubstitute for asparagus, a delicacy which it closely resembles. It\r\nis more prolific than asparagus, grows in the same soil, and\r\nrequires less attention.\r\n\r\nNot only plants but animals are experimented with by Uncle Sam's\r\nexperts. Officials of the Bureau of Animal Industry claim that\r\nbefore long we will partake of antelope steak. For the antelope has\r\nbeen found to be particularly adapted to the more arid western\r\nsections of the country. And beyond that the gastronomist of the\r\nfuture will have to reckon with loin of hippopotamus!\r\n\r\nThe lower valley of the Mississippi is admirably suited to these\r\nhuge beasts, the flesh of one of which equals a score of cattle.\r\nAfrican traveled epicures maintain that hippopotamus steak is as\r\ntender and inviting as the choicest beef. \"For those who like that\r\nsort of thing, it is just the sort of thing they would like.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems a bit remote to urge hippopotamus on us who do not yet know\r\nenough to eat sharks, tortoises, painted turtles, or even English\r\nsparrows. Anyhow the small gardener is more likely to succeed\r\nraising pheasants than to muss with a hippopotamus, at least in the\r\nsuburbs. Pigs are more practical and make prettier pets.\r\n\r\nOur population bids fair to approximate two hundred million within\r\nthe next fifty years, and, because of the exigencies of business, an\r\nincreasing number of people will be engaged in non-food-producing\r\nvocations. These people, however, are all consumers and must be fed\r\nand clothed, and even now America offers the greatest market for the\r\nproduce of the farm that any farmer in any country has ever had in\r\nall history.\r\n\r\nOne of the coming ways of feeding them is the discovery and use of\r\nnew foods. As in other things, after the war, whether we live in a\r\nbetter world or not, we shall live in an entirely different world,\r\nnew ways, strange thoughts, and other foods. For the most of the\r\nfollowing, _Business America_ and _Current Opinion_ are responsible.\r\n\r\nFor the creation of new crop varieties or the improvement of those\r\nnow in use we must depend upon the practical scientists who are\r\nengaged in plant breeding. The work of one of these, Professor\r\nBuffum, has been accomplished in a region that is apparently sterile\r\nand where plants grow only by coaxing through artificial moisture.\r\n\r\nHis plant-breeding farms near Worland in the Big Horn Basin of\r\nNorthern Wyoming lie at an elevation of 4000 feet, in a region of\r\nalmost total natural aridity.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty years' work in Western agricultural colleges and\r\nGovernment Experiment Stations, Professor Buffum chose his present\r\nlocation because nowhere in the United States could he find\r\nconditions of soil and climate that induce to such a remarkable\r\ndegree the breaking up of species, and mutation or \"sporting\" of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nWhen the modern plant breeder seeks to produce something new by\r\ncross-fertilization a problem is encountered. For many years we were\r\nignorant of the principle upon which nature operated in these\r\nhybrids or crosses. Finally a Bohemian priest named Mendel\r\ndiscovered the law. The central principle is that when the seed\r\nproduced from a cross between two different species is planted, the\r\nprogeny breaks up into well-defined groups. A certain percentage of\r\nthe plants resemble one of the parents, a smaller percentage are\r\nlike the other parent, and the rest seem to be a blend of both\r\nparents. These intermediates will not breed true to themselves,\r\nhowever; if seed from them is planted the progeny will split up into\r\ngroups, showing the same percentages as the first generation to\r\nwhich they belonged. This has been generally accepted by scientists.\r\n\r\nIn many of his productions Professor Buffum apparently has set the\r\nMendelian law at defiance, for, by cross-fertilization, he has\r\nevolved plants which breed true to themselves, and their progeny\r\ndoes not break up into groups, according to the accepted theory.\r\nThey show specimens resembling each parent, with the third composed\r\nof seemingly, but not really, blended specimens.\r\n\r\nThese results are particularly vital in the development of plants\r\nadapted by selection for semi-arid agriculture. The Professor\r\nbelieves that the great areas of high plain country to be found from\r\nCanada to Mexico can be made more productive through planting crop\r\nvarieties that have been bred to withstand the existing conditions\r\nwhich produce meagre returns from the vast expanse of territory\r\nunder the present methods.\r\n\r\nIn place of corn, which is difficult to mature even at moderate\r\nelevations, Professor Buffum has introduced improved emmers and the\r\nvarious hybrids resulting from crosses with other grains.\r\n\r\nEmmer itself is not a new grain, having been grown for centuries in\r\nRussia and southern Europe, and it is believed to have been the corn\r\nof Pliny, which he said was used by the Latins for several centuries\r\nbefore they knew how to make bread.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago emmer began receiving attention as a stock food.\r\nThe first planting of the grain at Worland resulted in some\r\nexceptional \"sports,\" seemingly of a different type, with coarse\r\nstraw and very large heads. With this as a basis, the seed was\r\nreplanted and subjected to many experiments to increase its drouth\r\nand winter resisting qualities. Continued selections have shown, a\r\nyield of from a third more to twice as much as corn, that it is\r\nthirty per cent more valuable than oats for feeding horses, and that\r\nfor stock fattening it is equal to corn, pound for pound. It is the\r\nmost drouth-resistant and prolific of small grains, has been\r\nsuccessfully raised from Montana to Mexico, and is being planted in\r\nLouisiana to replace oats because it is not affected by rust.\r\n\r\nSome of the yields recorded are enormous, varying from 40 to 104\r\nbushels per acre under dry farming, and as high as 152 bushels under\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nOne stalk of Turkey red wheat was noticed as differing in many ways\r\nfrom all varieties, principally that the head was over eight inches\r\nin length, whereas the ordinary Turkey red wheat commonly used in\r\nthe West has a head of only four or five inches.\r\n\r\nFrom this one stalk has been developed the Buffum No. 17 Winter\r\nwheat. The heavy beards were eliminated and the grains or kernels in\r\neach spikelet increased from the normal number of three to five,\r\nseven, and even nine. The hardiness of the new variety, together\r\nwith its remarkably large head, means that when it is placed on the\r\nmarket the farmers who sow it need not fear winter killing and will\r\nhave a splendid flouring grain, which will produce nearly double the\r\naverage crop per acre.\r\n\r\nIt is said that if a single kernel could be added to each head of\r\nwheat, the increase in annual production of this country would\r\namount to over fifteen million bushels.\r\n\r\nIf fodder crops can be substituted for a part of the corn now used\r\nfor stock, it will be a great gain.\r\n\r\nIn his alfalfa-breeding garden, Professor Buffum is raising over\r\nseventy different kinds, gathered from all parts of the world,\r\nshowing that the plant is capable of wide variations. One hybrid has\r\nbeen obtained by crossing sweet clover with alfalfa; the clover\r\ngrows wild in every state in the Union.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no limit to man's ingenuity and skill in plant\r\nimprovement. Perhaps sometime we will try it with our children.\r\n\r\nIn thirty years an exceptional ear of dent corn, through continued\r\nplanting and careful selection each succeeding season, resulted in a\r\nfew days' shortening of the growing period and an increased\r\nresistance to the cool nights of the higher elevation where it was\r\nunder improvement; to-day, this corn matures about the middle of\r\nAugust at an altitude of 4000 feet, and has been yielding forty to\r\nsixty bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nDRIED TRUCK\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a war measure the surplus vegetables in many city markets have\r\nbeen forced by the governments into large municipal drying plants.\r\nCommunity driers have been established in the trucking regions and\r\neven itinerant drying machines have been sent from farm to farm\r\ndrying the vegetables which otherwise would have gone to waste.\r\n\r\nThe drying of vegetables may seem strange to the present generation,\r\nbut we are very young; to our grandmothers it was no novelty. Many\r\nhousewives even to-day prefer dried sweet corn to the canned, and\r\nfind also that dried pumpkin and squash are excellent for pie\r\nmaking. Snap beans often are strung on threads and dried above the\r\nstove. Cherries and raspberries still are dried on bits of bark for\r\nuse instead of raisins.\r\n\r\nThis country is producing large quantities of perishable foods every\r\nyear, which should be saved for storage, canned, or properly dried.\r\nDrying is not a panacea for the waste evil, nor should it take the\r\nplace of storing or canning to any considerable extent where proper\r\nstorage facilities are available or tin cans or glass jars can be\r\nobtained cheap.\r\n\r\nFor the farmer's wife the new methods of canning are probably better\r\nthan sun drying, which requires a somewhat longer time. But dried\r\nmaterial can be stored in receptacles which cannot be used for\r\ncanning. Then, too, canned fruit and vegetables freeze and cannot be\r\nshipped as conveniently--in winter. Dried vegetables can be\r\ncompacted and shipped or stored with a minimum of risk. String them\r\nup to the ceiling of the storeroom or attic.\r\n\r\nA few apples or sweet potatoes or peas or even a single turnip can\r\nbe dried and saved. Even when very small quantities are dried at a\r\ntime, a quantity sufficient for a meal will soon be secured. Small\r\nlots of dried vegetables, such as cabbage, carrots, turnips,\r\npotatoes, and onions, can be combined to advantage for soups and\r\nstews.\r\n\r\nIn general, most fruits or vegetables, to be dried quickly, must\r\nfirst be shredded or cut into slices, because many are too large to\r\ndry quickly, or have skins the purpose of which is to prevent drying\r\nout. If the air applied at first is too hot, the cut surfaces of the\r\nsliced fruits or vegetables become hard, or scorched, covering the\r\njuicy interior so that it will not dry. Generally it is not\r\ndesirable that the temperature in drying should go above 140 deg to\r\n150 deg F., and it is better to keep it well below this point. Insects\r\nand insect eggs are killed by the heat.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know the degree of heat in the drier, and this\r\ncannot be determined accurately except by a thermometer. Inexpensive\r\noven thermometers can be found on the market, or an ordinary\r\nchemical thermometer can be suspended in the drier.\r\n\r\nDrying of certain products can be completed in some driers within\r\ntwo or three hours. When sufficiently done they should be so dry\r\nthat water cannot be pressed out of the freshly cut pieces, they\r\nshould not show any of the natural grain of the fruit on being\r\nbroken, and yet not be so dry as to snap or crackle. They should be\r\nleathery and pliable.\r\n\r\nWhen freshly cut fruits or vegetables are spread out they\r\nimmediately begin to evaporate moisture into the air, and if in a\r\nclosed box will very soon saturate the air with moisture. This will\r\nslow down the rate of drying and lead to the formation of molds. If\r\na current of dry air is blown over them continually, the water in\r\nthem will evaporate steadily until they are dry and crisp. Certain\r\nproducts, especially raspberries, should not be dried hard, because\r\nif too much moisture is removed from them they will not resume their\r\noriginal form when soaked in water.\r\n\r\nThe rotary hand slicer is adapted for use on a very wide range of\r\nmaterial. Don't slice your hand with it.\r\n\r\nFrom an eighth to a quarter of an inch is a fair thickness for most\r\nof the common vegetables to be sliced. To secure fine quality, much\r\ndepends upon having the vegetables absolutely fresh, young, tender,\r\nand perfectly clean; one decayed root may flavor several kettles of\r\nsoup if the slices from it are scattered through a batch of\r\nmaterial. High-grade \"root\" vegetables can only be made from peeled\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nBlanching consists of plunging the vegetables into boiling water for\r\na short time. Use a wire basket or cheesecloth bag for this. After\r\nblanching as many minutes as is needed, drain well and remove the\r\nsurface moisture from vegetables by placing them between two towels\r\nor by exposing them to the sun and air for a short time.\r\n\r\nA mosquito net is thrown over the product to protect the slices from\r\nflies and other insects. Fruits and vegetables, when dried in the\r\nsun, generally are spread on large trays of uniform size which can\r\nbe stacked one on top of the other and protected from rain by covers\r\nmade of oilcloth, canvas, or roofing paper.\r\n\r\nA very cheap tray can be made of lath three fourths of an inch thick\r\nand 2 inches wide, which form the sides and ends of a box, and\r\nsmoothed lath which is nailed on to form the bottom. As builders'\r\nlaths are 4 feet long, these lath trays are most economical of\r\nmaterial when made 4 feet in length.\r\n\r\nA cheap and very satisfactory drier for use over the kitchen stove\r\ncan be made by any handy man of small-mesh galvanized-wire netting\r\nand laths or strips of wood about 1/2 inch thick and 2 inches wide. By\r\nusing two laths nailed together the framework can be stiffened and\r\nlarger trays made if desirable. This form can be suspended from the\r\nceiling over the kitchen range or over a clear burning oil,\r\ngasoline, or gas stove, and it will utilize the hot air which rises\r\nduring the cooking hour. It can be raised out of the way or swung to\r\none side by a pulley or by a crane made of lath. When the stove is\r\nrequired for cooking, the frame is lowered or swung back to utilize\r\nthe heat which otherwise would be wasted. Still another home drier\r\nis the cookstove oven. Bits of food, left overs, especially sweet\r\ncorn, can be dried on plates in a very slow oven or on the back of\r\nthe cookstove and saved for winter use.\r\n\r\nWhere the electric \"juice\" is not monopolized, an electric fan in\r\ndrying is economical, especially for those who already have a fan.\r\n\r\nMany sliced fruits placed in long trays 3 by 1 foot and stacked in\r\ntwo tiers, end to end, before an electric fan can be dried within\r\ntwenty-four hours. Some require much less time. For instance, sliced\r\nstring beans and shredded sweet potatoes will dry before a fan\r\nrunning at a moderate speed within a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe dried fruit or vegetables must be protected from insects and\r\nrodents, also from the outside moisture, and will keep best in a\r\ncool, dry, well-ventilated place. In the more humid regions,\r\nmoisture-tight containers should be used. If a small amount of dried\r\nproduct is put in each receptacle, just enough for one or two meals,\r\nit will not be necessary to open a large container.\r\n\r\nYour American ingenuity and the American practice of reading will\r\nshow you a lot of ways of saving waste: for example, frozen potatoes\r\nare not necessarily spoiled, we are told by Mr. de Ronsic, a writer\r\nin the _Reveil Agricole_. They may be dried and then cooked as\r\nusual. The _Revue Scientifique_ (Paris), abstracting the article in\r\nquestion, says:\r\n\r\n\"The potatoes must be dried to prevent decomposition, which takes\r\nplace very rapidly after they have thawed out. . . .\" The oven\r\nshould be heated as for baking bread. Then, when it has reached the\r\nnecessary temperature, which is easily recognized, the potatoes are\r\nput in, cutting up the largest. They are spread out in a layer so\r\nthat evaporation may easily take place, the door of the oven being\r\nleft open. From time to time the mass is stirred up with a poker to\r\nfacilitate the evaporation. When the drying has gone far enough, the\r\npotatoes having become hard as bits of wood, they are withdrawn to\r\nmake room for others.\r\n\r\n\"Potatoes thus dried may be boiled with enough water to make a paste\r\nsimilar to that which they would have furnished if mashed in the\r\nordinary manner, and which will answer very well, at least to feed\r\nstock. The potatoes will be found to have lost none of their\r\nnutritive value.\"\r\n\r\nEven if you haven't any acres--yet, there isn't any law against\r\ndrying in the city. Either in sales or in saving it will help to pay\r\nfor the country place later and the country place can be made to pay\r\nit back again.\r\n\r\nCall your product say \"Landers' Desiccated Beans\" or \"Glory's\r\nDehydrated Corn.\" They will sell better, they may even taste better,\r\ntrying to live up to the description. There's dollars in a name.\r\n\r\nAs a preservative ice must not be neglected. The _Country Gentleman_\r\nsays:\r\n\r\nWhile the temperature is below the freezing point we should take\r\nadvantage of even short frosts to lay up ice for next summer. The\r\nman without an ice pond need not be, without ice--he can freeze it\r\nin pans outdoors. An ice plant of this sort will cost from fifteen\r\nto twenty dollars.\r\n\r\nA double tank should be made of galvanized iron. The inner\r\ncompartment of this tank should be ten feet long, two feet wide, and\r\ntwelve inches deep. The top of the tank should be slightly wider\r\nthan the bottom. The inner tank should be divided into six\r\ncompartments by means of galvanized iron strips. The double tank\r\nshould be placed near the outdoor pump, or stream, where it can\r\neasily be filled.\r\n\r\nBeing exposed on all sides, the water will freeze in from one hour\r\nto three hours. A bucket of hot water poured into the space between\r\nthe tanks will loosen the cakes of ice, each weighing 200 pounds.\r\nFour tons of ice will last the average family a year. The cakes may\r\nbe packed away in the icehouse as they are frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nHOME COLD-PACK CANNING\r\n\r\n\r\nTo save vegetables and fruits by canning is a patriotic duty. The\r\nwar makes the need for food conservation more imperative than at any\r\ntime in history. America is mainly responsible for the food supply\r\nof the world. In this way the abundance of the summer may be made to\r\nsupply the needs of the winter.\r\n\r\nBy the modern cold-pack method it is as easy to can vegetables as to\r\ncan fruits. Some authorities say it is easier. At any rate, it is\r\nmore useful.\r\n\r\nIn the cold-pack method of canning, sterilization does away with the\r\ndanger of spoilage by fermentation or \"working.\" Sterilization\r\nconsists in raising the temperature of the filled jar or can to a\r\ngerm-killing point and holding it there until bacterial life is\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe word \"container\" is used to designate either the tin can or the\r\nglass jar.\r\n\r\nSingle-period cold-pack canning, as distinguished from old-fashioned\r\npreserving, offers a saving in time, labor, and expense, and\r\nsatisfactory results. As the foodstuffs are placed in the containers\r\nbefore sterilization, they are cold and may be handled quickly and\r\neasily. Then the sterilization period is frequently short. This is\r\ntime-saving. Finally, no rich preservatives, such as thick syrups or\r\nheavily spiced solutions, are required. Fruits may be put up in thin\r\nsyrups. Vegetables require only salt for flavoring and water to fill\r\nthe container.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of this method is that it is practicable to put up\r\nfood in small quantities. It pays to put up even a single container.\r\nThus, when there is a small surplus of some garden crop, or\r\nsomething left over from the order from the grocer's, one can take\r\nthe short time necessary to place this food in a container and store\r\nit for future use. This is true household efficiency--the kind\r\nwhich, if practiced on a national scale, will conserve our war food\r\nsupply and will, after the war, cut heavily into the high cost of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nThere are five principal methods of canning: (1) the cold-pack,\r\nsingle-period method; (2) the intermittent, or fractional\r\nsterilization method; (3) the cold-water method; (4) the open kettle\r\nor hot-pack method; and (5) the vacuum-seal method. Of these the one\r\nworked out on scientific lines by leading experts and used by many\r\ncommercial canners is so much the best method for home canning,\r\nbecause of its simplicity and effectiveness, that it is recommended\r\nby the National Emergency Food Commission and the details are\r\nexplained in their manual.\r\n\r\nThe cold-water method can be used effectively in putting up rhubarb,\r\ngreen gooseberries, and a few other sour berry fruits. The process\r\nis simple. The fruit is first prepared and washed and then blanched,\r\nand finally packed practically raw in containers, which are next\r\nfilled with cold water and then sealed. Some sour fruits packed in\r\nthis way will keep indefinitely.\r\n\r\nA serviceable outfit may be made of materials found in any\r\nhousehold. All that is necessary is a vessel to hold the jars or\r\ncans--such as a wash boiler or a large tin pail. This should have a\r\ntight-fitting cover. Provide a false bottom of wood or a wire rack\r\nto allow for free circulation of water under the containers.\r\n\r\nWhile suburban gardeners with large surplus of vegetables find it\r\ndesirable to use tin cans, being more easily handled for commercial\r\npurposes, most of us find glass jars the more satisfactory and\r\neconomical containers for canned vegetables and fruits. This is\r\nespecially true when there is a shortage of tin cans. All types of\r\njars that seal perfectly may be used. Use may be made of those to\r\nwhich one is accustomed or which may be already on hand. The rubbers\r\nmust be sound but the glass jars may be used indefinitely. Glass\r\njars are adapted for use in any of the cold-pack canning outfits. Be\r\nsure that no jar is defective.\r\n\r\nFor use in the storing of products which are already sterilized,\r\nsuch as jellies, jams, and preserves, and the bottling of fruit\r\njuices, housewives may practice effective thrift by saving all jars\r\nin which they receive dried beef, bacon, peanut butter, and other\r\nproducts and bottles that have contained olives, catsup, and kindred\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nBlanching is important with most vegetables and many fruits. It\r\nconsists of plunging them into boiling water for a short time.\r\nSpinach and other greens should be blanched in steam. To do this,\r\nplace them in an ordinary steamer or suspend them in a tightly\r\nclosed vessel above an inch or two of boiling water.\r\n\r\nBlanching should be followed by the cold dip, plunging into cold\r\nwater after removal from the hot water. Cold dipping hardens the\r\npulp and preserves the original color, enhancing the appearance.\r\nBlanching cleanses the articles and removes excess acids and strong\r\nflavors and odors. It also causes shrinkage, so that a larger\r\nquantity may be packed in a container. After blanching and cold\r\ndipping, surface moisture should be removed by placing the\r\nvegetables or fruits between two towels or by exposure to the sun.\r\n\r\nAll this is so simple and the directions so easily followed that the\r\naverage 12-year-old may successfully can vegetables or fruits. The\r\nsteps and the precautions are:\r\n\r\n1. Select sound vegetables and fruits. (If possible can them the\r\nsame day they are picked.) Wash, clean, and prepare them.\r\n\r\n2. Have ready, on the stove, a can or pail of boiling water.\r\n\r\n3. Place the vegetables or fruits in cheesecloth, or in some other\r\nporous receptacle--a wire basket is excellent--for dipping and\r\nblanching them in the boiling water.\r\n\r\n4. Put them whole into the boiling water. The Commission gives a\r\ntime-table for blanching. After the water begins to boil, begin to\r\ncount the blanching time; this varies from one to twenty minutes,\r\naccording to the vegetable or fruit.\r\n\r\n5. When the blanching is complete, remove the vegetables or fruits\r\nfrom the boiling water and plunge them a number of times into cold\r\nwater, to harden the pulp and check the flow of coloring matter. Do\r\nnot leave them in cold water.\r\n\r\n6. The containers must be thoroughly clean. It is not necessary to\r\nsterilize them in steam or boiling water before filling them, as in\r\nthe cold-pack process both the insides of containers and the\r\ncontents are sterilized. The jars should be heated before being\r\nfilled, in order to avoid breakage.\r\n\r\n7. Pack the product into the containers, leaving about a quarter of\r\nan inch of space at the top.\r\n\r\n8. With vegetables add one level teaspoonful of salt to each quart\r\ncontainer and fill with boiling water. With fruits use syrups.\r\n\r\n9. With glass jars always use a good rubber. Test the rubber by\r\nstretching or turning inside out. Fit on the rubber and put the lid\r\nin place. If the container has a screw top do not screw up as hard\r\nas possible, but use only the thumb and little finger in tightening\r\nit. This makes it possible for the steam to escape and prevents\r\nbreakage. If a glass top jar is used, snap the top bail only,\r\nleaving the lower bail loose during sterilization. Tin cans should\r\nbe completely sealed.\r\n\r\n10. Place the filled and capped containers on the rack in the\r\nsterilizer. If the homemade or commercial hot-water bath outfit is\r\nused, enough water should be in the boiler to come at least one inch\r\nabove the tops of the containers, and the water, in boiling out,\r\nshould never be allowed to drop to the level of these tops. Begin to\r\ncount processing time when the water begins to boil.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the sterilizing period remove the containers from the\r\nsterilizer. Fasten covers on tightly at once, turn the containers\r\nupside down to test for leakage, leave in this position until cold,\r\nand then store in a cool, dry place. Be sure that no draft is\r\nallowed to blow on glass jars, as it may cause breakage.\r\n\r\n11. If jars are to be stored where there is strong light, wrap them\r\nin paper, preferably brown, as light will fade the color of products\r\ncanned in glass jars, and sometimes deteriorate the food value.\r\n\r\nThat's the whole trick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nRETAIL COOPERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION in buying supplies at wholesale, in standardizing and\r\nshipping crops, in keeping grain in elevators, and fruit and some\r\nmeats and poultry in cold storage has reached a high development\r\namong the farmers largely in the Northwest, much ahead of us \"city\r\nfolks.\"\r\n\r\nThere are more than five thousand active Farmers' Cooperation\r\nAssociations in the United States. Minnesota alone has over six\r\nhundred cooperative creameries, some of which have a laundry annex.\r\nThe associations have six hundred and sixty thousand members and do\r\na business of nearly a thousand dollars a year for each member.\r\nThese are the people that we call \"hayseeds\"; if we could plant some\r\nmore such \"seeds,\" it would be a good job. But in cooperative retail\r\ndomestic supply we are far behind England and other countries, even\r\nbehind Russia. That is partly because our better retail business\r\nmethods leave less room for the savings.\r\n\r\nA simple and easy but important beginning of cooperation was where\r\neach one took turns in delivering the milk and fetching supplies.\r\nOne farmer might do it all every day for a small charge.\r\n\r\nThe new South is developing a great business in this line. When you\r\ngo to New Orleans look up the stores whose letter head reads:\r\n\r\n  NELSON CO-OPERATIVE ASSOCIATION, INC.\r\n  _Food Suppliers_\r\n  OFFICE, 506 So. PETERS STREET. CREAMERY, ERATO ST.\r\n  WAREHOUSE, 511 SO. PETERS ST. BAKERY, ELYSIAN FIELDS AVE.\r\n  61 RETAIL STORES\r\n  4 MEAT MARKETS\r\n\r\nIn August, 1917, N. O. Nelson of the above concern writes in answer\r\nto my request:\r\n\r\n\"It does not take 2500 words to tell all I know about Cooperation. I\r\ntrust the inclosed may be serviceable for your book, and shall feel\r\nproud if it is.\r\n\r\n\"I am doing my job here for two very practical reasons; first, the\r\nimmediate service of reducing the cost of living to say 15,000\r\nfamilies, mostly poor; second, to introduce economy in retailing.\r\n\r\n\"The readers of such a book as yours are well aware of the wasteful\r\nways of retailing goods. In every town and city there is a\r\nmultiplication of stores, advertising clerks, teams, and other\r\nincidentals.\r\n\r\n\"Likewise there is a lot of middle men and drummers, the buyers at\r\nthe producer's end, the wholesalers or middle men at the consumer's\r\nend, with speculator and landowner at both ends. All of these have\r\nto be supported by the system, and the dear consumer pays for it.\r\n\r\n\"The Cooperative store system, which was started in England 73\r\nyears ago, eliminates most of these waste expenses. The system has\r\nkept spreading at an astonishing rate; in Great Britain there are\r\nnow 3 1/2 million members, and more than a billion of sales a year.\r\nOther European countries are full of these stores. Many of the\r\nretail stores have from twelve thousand to fifty thousand members;\r\ntheir sales run into the millions. They are federated in a wholesale\r\nagency which buys for them and manufactures on an extensive scale.\r\n\r\n\"By the economies thus introduced they are able to save regularly\r\nabout 15%, besides paying interest on the capital employed, and\r\naccumulating a liberal surplus. It is simply a question of people\r\ngetting together (all civilization is), contributing their own money\r\nand their trade, and thus avoiding all the waste expenses.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very democratic plan; anybody is welcome to join it; every\r\nmember has one vote and no more, they elect their directors, the\r\ndirectors elect the managers, and the managers employ the clerks.\r\nThey sell at the market prices and every three or six months take\r\naccount of stock and rebate the profits in proportion to each\r\nmember's purchases, with half rate to non-members.\r\n\r\n\"It appeals to the economical sense of the ordinary housekeeper, and\r\nto the ethical sense of those who want no advantage of their\r\nneighbor. It prevents some from getting unduly rich and it helps to\r\nkeep many from being unduly poor.\r\n\r\n\"The same principle has spread into farmer's work, especially\r\nCreameries. In Cooperative Creameries and Stores Russia has grown\r\nfaster in the last 15 years than any other country, having at last\r\nreports over thirteen million members. This orderly getting together\r\nfor common social needs has much to do with the orderliness of the\r\nRussian Revolution.\r\n\r\n\"The United States has made large progress in producers' cooperative\r\nassociations, but not much in stores.\r\n\r\n\"I have in New Orleans a system of 65 stores on a modified system;\r\nit is a cooperative association but we sell at as low prices as can\r\nbe afforded, for cash in hand. The sales amount to about 2 1/2\r\nmillions, the most of it in the winter. The Association owns a\r\nBakery, a Creamery, Condiment Factory; and Coffee Factory, and a\r\n1550-acre plantation. We are able to undersell the market about 20%.\r\n\r\n\"People anywhere can make a cooperative store if they take it\r\nseriously. There should be about 200 members and $2000 in cash to\r\nstart with: then get an honest and intelligent manager; start with a\r\ngrocery, buy and sell for cash, either on the Rochdale plan of\r\nselling at full market prices and dividing the profits periodically,\r\nor on my plan of selling as cheaply as can be afforded. In either\r\nplan it works out into producing a large part of the goods sold,\r\nthus eliminating entirely the superfluous middleman.\r\n\r\n\"Three acres and Liberty is the correct way of producing a living;\r\nwith the adjunct of a cooperative store to do the selling of the\r\nsurplus produced and the buying of goods needed, the small farmer is\r\nfree from all the waste and trammels of trade.\"\r\n\r\nNow what's the matter with your helping your county and country and\r\nhumanity by organizing those two hundred waiting buyers in your own\r\ntown? You can be the \"honest and intelligent manager\" at a decent\r\nsalary. If, later, the cooperators want another manager, why you can\r\neasily organize another store. The best information on this subject\r\nis the Cooperative News, Manchester, England; subscription two\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nEvidence is daily accumulating that the food and farm problem is not\r\nso easy as many thought it to be a few months ago. This is made\r\nclear when economists say: \"The really important question in the\r\nfood problem is not distribution, it is production.\" It is\r\nunfortunate that this statement should gain belief at this time,\r\nwhen those who prey upon the producer are watching for any support\r\nfrom whatever direction.\r\n\r\nPassing by the obvious fact that production must precede\r\ndistribution, notice that, with all the energy that has been devoted\r\nto production of farm products by the government experts, it is\r\nclear that not only is there a shortage, but that it has required\r\nall kinds of inducements, from the President down, to get the\r\nfarmers to increase their output, the most potent of all being the\r\ncry of patriotism.\r\n\r\nSome explain this by showing how land monopoly prevents men going\r\nback to the farms. While this is perfectly true, it does not answer\r\nthe question why farmers now in possession of farms are not working\r\nthem near their capacity.\r\n\r\nThe answer of the ordinary man to this is inefficiency on the part\r\nof the farmer, and up to the present this idea has passed as\r\nsufficient to account for the situation. The publicity given the\r\nwhole farm question during the past six months, however, has to a\r\nlarge extent dispelled the inefficiency answer, as the farmer has\r\nresponded so completely to the call, and the amateurs are beginning\r\nto realize that there is something in farming besides tickling the\r\nearth with a feather. All the facts so far brought out show the\r\nfarmer abundantly able to produce all the foodstuffs needed,\r\nprovided he has a reasonable certainty that he will be able to\r\ndispose of his produce at a price that will give him a fair return\r\nfor his labor. This being the case, it is easy to see that putting\r\nmore men back on farms would not remedy the condition we are now in;\r\nbut would rather increase the difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the two blades of grass theory has been exploded, the\r\nincreased production cry has been tried out, carried to its logical\r\nconclusion, and found wanting, and the inefficiency explanation has\r\nbeen proved a falsehood on its face. It is, therefore, obvious that\r\nwith a proper system of distribution, the entire question of\r\nproduction will take care of itself; but just so long as the\r\nproducers find it unprofitable to produce food, just so long will\r\nthey have to figure carefully not to grow too much, or it would be\r\nbetter for them had they grown nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we have such divergent ideas on this subject is that\r\nso many people write about it who have had no experience in farming,\r\nwhile on the other hand there are few farmers who can state the case\r\nso the public can grasp the most obvious facts.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is a question of the government doing what it ought not\r\nto have done and leaving undone those things it ought to have done.\r\nIt has granted to a few monopolies transportation and terminal\r\nfacilities which enable them to hold up deliveries and thus control\r\nprices. The remedy lies in seeing that the government attend to its\r\nown business, which is securing equality of opportunity for all, and\r\nspecial privileges to none.\r\n\r\nIt follows that cooperation should not stop either at production or\r\nat distribution. It must embrace the source of both, nor even stop\r\nat governmental plans of small holdings.\r\n\r\nAs a business enterprise, combining philanthropy and percentage,\r\ncapital has an opportunity.\r\n\r\nAccordingly an option should be secured upon a large piece of land\r\nnot over forty miles from a large city, near a railroad station. The\r\ntransportation at first is not important, as the new commuters will\r\nmake a demand for it, and cheap autos will largely fill the gap; it\r\nwill improve rapidly.\r\n\r\nIf possible it should have a lake or a fair stream on it for\r\nirrigation and small water power; the soil should be examined by\r\nexperts, to see that it is suitable for trucking and market\r\ngardening.\r\n\r\nThe object should be to make a sort of vacant lot gardening plan on\r\na grand scale. Heretofore the trouble has been that we have been\r\nunable to get land where there was any assurance that we could have\r\nit again the second year, and that the limited amount of land makes\r\nit impossible to give the men as much as they ought to have. They do\r\nnot need much land, because a man working at intensive culture with\r\nonly the rough plowing done for him cannot take good care of much\r\nmore than one acre of land. He will probably make as much money out\r\nof one acre of land as he will out of two. Those who are willing to\r\nwork should be given one acre of land, with the assurance that they\r\ncan have it as long as they work it faithfully and comply with the\r\nsimple rules which we have found so effective in the Vacant Lot\r\nGardening work,--which are practically, that a man should attend to\r\nbusiness and not annoy his neighbors. No contract or lease should be\r\ngiven the men, or indeed the women, for both work such gardens, as\r\nthey have been doing for the past twenty years in several large\r\ncities, making at least a living upon the land and often a very\r\nlarge return.\r\n\r\nThere must be a competent superintendent, for everything depends\r\nupon him, who would show the men what land they should use, what\r\nthey should put in, instruct them how to do it, and market their\r\nproducts cooperatively. Experience in Philadelphia, and in some\r\nscore of other cities where they have established Vacant Lot\r\nGardens, shows that about ten per cent annually of the people prefer\r\nto work for others, and consequently take places in the country\r\nafter they have learned to do market gardening. Some others, being\r\ndissatisfied with so little land, and wanting to own their own\r\nplace, go off and buy land or lease it for themselves. This makes a\r\nconstant drain from the gardens, leaving openings for others who\r\nwill learn in time their trade; it is possible to make in this way a\r\nsteady drain out of the cities to the country, and what is better\r\nstill, an automatic drain.\r\n\r\nThe land must be so near to a center of population that it may be\r\npossible to take a gang of men down there in the morning, show them\r\nwhat it is, and send back those who do not seem likely to make good,\r\nor who are dissatisfied; and that when men get their gardens\r\nsuccessfully running, they may be able to bring their friends there\r\nto see what they have done, and say to them, \"Go thou and do\r\nlikewise.\"\r\n\r\nI have been at Trudeau, Saranac Lake, and at Stony Wold, the\r\nconsumptive sanitariums, and found there both by observation and by\r\ntestimony that to send back the convalescents to the bench or the\r\nworkshop from which they came is practically to repronounce upon\r\nthem the sentence of death from which the sanitarium has offered\r\nthem a reprieve. The only practical thing to do with such\r\nconvalescents, and with such persons who are not capable of their\r\nordinary avocations, is to get them in some way upon the land. There\r\nis a large demand for persons who understand the new intensive\r\ngardening, and places can be found for more than we can hope to\r\neducate in that line.\r\n\r\nThere should be buildings upon the land sufficient to bunk one\r\nhundred to one hundred and fifty men; accommodations could be made\r\nwith the small timber for a considerable number. Many of these men\r\nwould need some help, but most of them would shift for themselves if\r\nonly they could get the opportunity to build upon the land and to\r\nhave a secure tenure of it. A mere tenant knows that it is bunkum\r\nwhen he says \"Our Country.\"\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly practicable to sell about one half of the land in a\r\nyear or two, and have a thousand acres or more left free and clear,\r\nwhich will cost the promoters nothing. Renting this out or selling\r\nit will repay the whole cost, and probably bring a large profit\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\nThis is no experiment, it is only to do the thing that we have been\r\ndoing under various conditions with various sorts of men in\r\ndifferent localities for the past twenty years in the Vacant Lot\r\nGardens: namely, to give men the opportunity of living upon and\r\ncultivating land, putting up their own tents, shacks, or bungalows,\r\nand giving them such instruction and such help as does not cost\r\nanything more than the salary of the superintendent. There are\r\nabundant men who can make good and shift for themselves under those\r\ncircumstances; the men who are available are single men, such men as\r\nthose for whom Mr. Hallimond, a clergyman working in the Bowery, has\r\nbeen finding rural employment in the past ten years. Also many\r\nfamilies will come to us through the Vacant Lot Gardens and the\r\nLittle Land agitation. People such as these will increase the land\r\nvalue, for every decent man carries around with him at least five\r\nhundred dollars' worth of increase in land values which his presence\r\nadds to somebody's holdings of land. The struggle to pocket this\r\nincrease accounts for much of the human drift from the field to the\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nGod made the country; man made the city--and the devil made the\r\nsuburbs, by the aid of the speculator.\r\n\r\nAlpha of the Plough says in the London _Star:_ \"I was walking with a\r\nfriend along the Spaniards-road the other evening talking on the\r\ninexhaustible theme of these days, when he asked, 'What is the\r\nbiggest thing that has happened to this country as the outcome of\r\nthe war?'\r\n\r\n\"'It is within two or three hundred yards from here,' I replied.\r\n'Come this way and I'll show it to you.'\r\n\r\n\"He seemed a little surprised, but accompanied me cheerfully enough\r\nas I turned from the road and plunged through the gorse and the\r\ntrees towards Parliament Fields, until we came upon a large expanse\r\nof allotments, carved out of the great playground, and alive with\r\nfigures, men, women, and children, some earthing up potatoes, some\r\nweeding onion beds, some thinning out carrots, some merely walking\r\nalong the patches, and looking at the fruits of their labor\r\nspringing from the soil. 'There,' I said, 'is the most important\r\nresult of the war.'\r\n\r\n\"He laughed, but not contemptuously. He knew what I meant, and I\r\nthink he more than half agreed.\r\n\r\n\"And I think you will agree, too, if you will think what that\r\nstretch of allotments means. It is the symptom of the most important\r\nrevival, the greatest spiritual awakening this country has seen for\r\ngenerations. Wherever you go, that symptom meets you. Here in\r\nHampstead allotments are as plentiful as blackberries in autumn. A\r\nfriend of mine who lives in Beckenham tells me there are fifteen\r\nhundred in his parish. In the neighborhood of London there must be\r\nmany thousands. In the country as a whole there must be hundreds of\r\nthousands. If dear old Joseph Fels could revisit the glimpses of the\r\nmoon and see what is happening, see the vacant lots and waste spaces\r\nbursting into onion beds and potato patches, what joy would be his!\r\nHe was the forerunner of the revival, the passionate pilgrim of the\r\nVacant Lot: but his hot gospel fell on deaf ears, and he died just\r\nbefore the trumpet of war awakened the sleeper.\r\n\r\n\"Do not suppose that the greatness of this thing that is happening\r\ncan be measured in terms of food. That is important, no doubt, but\r\nit is not the most important thing. I am confident that it will add\r\nmore than anything else to the spiritual resources of the nation. It\r\nis the beginning of a war on the disease that is blighting our\r\npeople. What is wrong with us? What is the root of our social and\r\nspiritual ailment? Is it not the divorce of the people from the\r\nsoil? For generations the wholesome red blood of the country has\r\nbeen sucked into the great towns, and we have built up a vast\r\nmachine of industry that has made slaves of us, shut out the light\r\nof the fields from our lives, left our children to grow like weeds\r\nin the slums, rootless and waterless, poisoned the healthy instincts\r\nof nature implanted in us, and put in their place the rank growths\r\nof the streets. Can you walk through a working-class district or a\r\nLancashire cotton town, with their huddle of airless streets,\r\nwithout a feeling of despair coming over you at the sense of this\r\nenormous perversion of life into the arid channels of death? Can you\r\ntake pride in an Empire on which the sun never sets when you think\r\nof the courts in which, as Will Crooks says, the sun never rises?\r\n\r\n\"And now the sun is going to rise. We have started a revolution that\r\nwill not end until the breath of the earth has come back to the soul\r\nof the people. The tyranny of the machine is going to be broken. The\r\ntyranny of the land monopoly is going to be lifted. Yes, you say,\r\nbut these people that I see working on the allotments are not the\r\npeople from the courts and the slums; but professional men, the\r\nsuperior artisan, and so on. That is true. But the movement must get\r\nhold of the _intelligenzia_ first. The important thing is that the\r\nbreach in the prison is made; the fresh air is filtering in; the\r\nidea is born--not still-born, mind you, but born a living thing. It\r\nis a way of salvation that will not be lost, and that all will\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\n\"We have found the land, and we are going back to possess it. Take a\r\nman out of the street and put him in a garden, and you have made a\r\nnew creature of him. I have seen the miracle again and again. I know\r\na bus conductor, for example, outwardly the most ordinary of his\r\nkind. But one night I mentioned allotments, touched the key of his\r\nsoul, and discovered that this man was going about his daily work\r\nirradiated by the thought of his garden triumphs. He had got a new\r\npurpose in life. He had got the spirit of the earth in his bones. It\r\nis not only the humanizing influence of the garden, it is its\r\ndemocratizing influence too.\r\n\r\n  \"When Adam delved and Eve span\r\n  Where was then the gentleman?'\r\n\r\nYou can get on terms with the lowliest if you will discuss gardens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nSUMMER COLONIES FOR CITY PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n(Condensed from the Annual Report of the U. S. Department of the\r\nInterior of the Commissioner of Education. Vol. 2, now out of\r\nprint.)\r\n\r\nBERLIN has not been boastful of a new sociological feature which it\r\nhas developed within the last fifteen years, a feature so\r\nrevolutionary in its bearing upon education and upon the general\r\nhealth of future generations, that it should be made known to the\r\nworld. As yet little has been said about this new agency. It may be\r\nbecause it is not a governmental institution, but the result of\r\nself-help and of the recognition of a plain necessity. It may be\r\nassumed that if the summer colonies had been instituted by the\r\ngovernment for the great majority who are poor it would not have\r\nsucceeded so well as it has.\r\n\r\nThe teachers, seeing that the horizon of their pupils was limited by\r\nbrick and mortar (for open park spaces are rare in Berlin), came to\r\nthe conclusion that only by giving their pupils opportunity to live\r\nin the open air could they lay a sound foundation of knowledge of\r\nnatural objects and processes as a basis for school studies. The\r\nteachers of themselves, however, could apply only palliative\r\nremedies, such as having sent to them, from the botanical gardens,\r\nthousands of specimens of plants, twigs, flowers, fruit, etc., for\r\nnature study in the schoolroom; planting flower beds around the\r\nschoolhouses; also, brief excursions into parks, and hanging up\r\nbefore the class colored pictures of landscapes and rural scenery.\r\n\r\nWhile in many cases, especially in large cities, the necessity was\r\nrecognized of getting the children out of the great desert of brick\r\nand mortar into the open air and into companionship with life in the\r\nfield, the garden, the brooks, and the woods, it had nowhere\r\nresulted in a systematic effort to aid the children of an entire\r\ncity in that way until it was tried in Berlin. Of course it is well\r\nunderstood, not only abroad, but in New York and in other large\r\ncities of this country, that something must be done to alleviate the\r\nwant of space and fresh air, and so recreation piers and roof\r\ngardens are provided, excursions of schools into parks are\r\nundertaken, open-air playgrounds are instituted, and similar efforts\r\nare made tending to mitigate the evil effects of city life; but all\r\nthese efforts are merely sporadic or temporary; they do not attack\r\nthe evil at the roots; moreover they are only drops in the bucket\r\nwhen compared with that which is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis tendency to cooperative and collective action has resulted in\r\nthis particular case in thousands of the children's _\"Arbor\r\nGardens\"_ round about the city. It is an experience \"en gros,\" one\r\nof such dimensions that cavil ceases and admiration rises supreme.\r\n\r\nThe German poor are very poor indeed, but parents were induced to\r\nrent, at a price of 4 marks ($1) or about 20 cents a month from May\r\nto October for the summer season, a patch of land in the suburbs of\r\nBerlin unfit for farmland because cut up by railroad tracks and\r\nnewly laid-out streets. On one of these patches a family might erect\r\nan arbor, or a small structure of boards with a wide veranda and a\r\ncorrugated iron roof, for housing themselves and children during the\r\nsummer months. The dwellings are of the most primitive kind and\r\nrather flimsy; no permanent structure can be allowed, for at any\r\ntime the owner of the land may give notice to vacate for the purpose\r\nof erecting a row of houses, railroad buildings, or other permanent\r\nstructures. The tenants themselves build fences of wire or plant\r\nhedges to keep the different plots apart. On these patches the\r\nchildren, under the guidance of teachers, parents, and appointed\r\nguardians, began to sow flower seeds, plant shrubs, vines, and\r\ntrees, or raise kitchen vegetables, each group or family according\r\nto its own desires and needs. Since the \"arbors\" are small they do\r\nnot decrease the arable land of the allotments much, and there is\r\nstill room left for swings, gymnastic apparatus, and similar\r\ncontrivances, as well as bare sandy spots for little tots to play\r\nin. The various allotments are mostly uniform in size and are\r\nreached by narrow three- or four-foot lanes, on which occasionally\r\nare seen probationary officers or guardians who keep the peace and\r\nsettle cases of disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe \"arbor gardens\" are established on every square rod of unused\r\nland round about the city, on vacant lots, far out to the borders of\r\nthe well-trained woods and royal forests. Small tradesmen, laboring\r\nmen, civil officials of low degrees, etc., have found it profitable\r\nto forsake their tenements in the city and move kith and kin into\r\nthose \"arbor colonies.\" The tenements in Berlin are as bad as in our\r\nown big cities, only better policed.\r\n\r\nNot all of these arbor gardens are occupied by families during the\r\nnight. Thousands return to their city homes evenings. Some parents,\r\nunable to free themselves from toil in town, send their children\r\nunder guidance of servants, and spend only occasional Sundays and\r\nholidays with them.\r\n\r\nThe people, especially the children, getting some information\r\nconcerning the treatment of the crops from competent advisers in\r\nschool and out in the arbor colonies, derive great good from their\r\nhorticultural and floricultural work. Families who are aesthetically\r\ninclined devote their space to flowers and trailing vines\r\nexclusively; others, utilitarians from necessity, plant potatoes,\r\ncarrots, turnips, beets, beans, strawberries, and the like. The\r\nfeeling of ownership being strongly developed in the children in\r\nseeing the results of their own labor, the crops are respected by\r\nthe neighbors and pilfering rarely occurs, except perhaps in a case\r\nof great hunger.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred or a thousand of such patches of land, or gardens,\r\nsituated in close proximity to each other, form an arbor colony,\r\nwhich has a governor, or mayor, who is an unpaid city official. He\r\narranges the leasing of the land, collects the rents, and hands them\r\nover to the gratified landowners who don't even have to collect\r\nthem. There is always a retired merchant or civil officer to fill\r\nthe office, to which is attached neither title, emolument, nor\r\nspecial honor. He is assisted by a \"colonial committee\" of trustees\r\nselected from the colonists, who act as justices of the peace, in\r\ncase disturbances should arise. If colonists prove frequent\r\ndisturbers of the peace or are found incapable of living quietly,\r\ntheir leases are not renewed. Of course there are such cases, but\r\nthey are rare.\r\n\r\nSince the size of an \"arbor garden\" is from about two sixteenths to\r\nthree sixteenths of an acre, say two or three New York City Lots,\r\nthose forming a colony make a considerable community, in which the\r\nauthority of the committee, or board of trustees, is absolute, and\r\nthe few cases they have had to adjudicate have generally been caused\r\nby nagging women. It is claimed in the press that these colonists\r\nare literally without scandals, and that the life led by young and\r\nold is a most peaceful and happy one. People who are hard at work\r\nare not likely to be quarrelsome: good wholesome food, much exercise\r\nin play and labor, and an abundance of fresh air and sunshine are\r\nconducive to happiness, especially as the clothing may be of a\r\nprimitive kind, or need not conform to the dictates of fashion.\r\n\r\nA teacher remarked: \"It is noticeable that since these school\r\nchildren are engaged in lucrative work which does not go beyond\r\ntheir strength, and since they see with their own eyes the results\r\nof their labor, a sense of responsibility is engendered which has a\r\nbeneficial influence upon school work also. Respect for all kinds of\r\nlabor and a decrease in the destructiveness so often found among\r\nboys are unmistakable effects of the arbor gardens. It is not easy\r\nwork which the children perform, for spade and rake require muscular\r\neffort; but it is ennobling work, for it leads to self-respect,\r\nself-dependence, and respect for others, as well as willingness to\r\naid others. The most beautiful sight is afforded when, on a certain\r\ndate agreed on by the members of a colony, a harvest festival is\r\nheld. Then flag raisings and illuminations and singing and music\r\nmake the day a memorable one.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the families had not the means to buy the lumber and\r\nhardware to erect an \"arbor,\" and yet they were the very ones to\r\nwhom the life in the open would be of the greatest benefit. Hence\r\nphilanthropy erected the structures. The Patriotic Woman's League of\r\nthe Red Cross built half of all the \"arbors\" of the colony found on\r\nthe \"Jungfernheide.\" Many colonies reach into the woods, and\r\nnaturally are of a different character from those in the open, for\r\nthere tents are used instead of wooden structures. For protection\r\nduring the night watchmen pace up and down the lanes; this before\r\nthe war entailed a cost of 7 1/2 cents a month to each family. The\r\nseason lasts from May 1 to October 1.\r\n\r\nThe school-going population meanwhile attend their schools, which\r\nused to be reached by means of the elevated cars or surface tramways\r\nfor 2 1/2 cents and much cheaper if they have commuters' tickets. Many\r\nschools are near enough to be reached on foot. The children do not\r\nloiter on the way, but when school is out they hurry \"home\" to begin\r\nwork in the garden, or to sit down to a meal on the veranda, which\r\nis relished far more than a meal in a city tenement house filled\r\nwith fetid air and wanting in light. Nearly every one of these\r\ngardens has a flagpole, and at night a Japanese paper lantern with a\r\ntallow dip in it illuminates the veranda. These, with flags by day,\r\nmake a festive appearance. The teachers find that city children who\r\nspend the five months in the open air are well equipped with\r\nelementary ideas in physical geography and astronomy. Their mental\r\nequipment is better, indeed, in all fields of thought, their\r\nphysical health is improved, as well as their ethical motives and\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nTo realize the full extent of these wholesale efforts (for put\r\nchildren into close contact with nature and they will improve in all\r\ndirections), it is well to take a ride on the North belt line\r\n(elevated steam railroad), the trains of which start from the\r\nFriedrich's street depot and bring one back after a ride of an hour\r\nand a half. Then one may do the same on the South belt line. On\r\nthese two trips one will see, not hundreds, but tens of thousands of\r\nsuch \"arbor gardens\" full of happy women and children at work or\r\nplay. The men come out on the belt line when their work in town is\r\ndone. The writer was riding through the city on an open cab, and\r\nseeing hardly any children on the streets and in the parks, he\r\nasked, \"How is it that we see no children out?\" \"Ah, sir,\" was the\r\nreply, \"if you will see the children of Berlin you must go out to\r\nthe arbor colonies outside of the city. There is where our children\r\nare.\" Subsequent visits to these colony gardens showed that Berlin\r\nis by no means a childless city. To judge from the multitudinous\r\narbors to be seen from the windows of the belt line cars there must\r\nbe 50,000 to 75,000 of them. As far as the eye reaches the\r\nflagpoles, the orderly fences, and the little structures can be\r\nseen; and since the city has 2,000,000 inhabitants, it is very\r\nlikely that an estimate made by a city official of several hundred\r\nthousands of children thus living in the open air, is not excessive.\r\nThe most beautiful and best-arranged gardens are not found in the\r\nvicinity of railroads, but several miles out toward the north and\r\nthe south of the city. Here, where the soil is better, fine crops\r\nare raised.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our eyes homeward and contemplate the many thousands of\r\nsmall efforts made in this country toward the alleviation of city\r\nchildren's misery, we can say truthfully that we in America are\r\nperhaps fully alive to the necessity which has prompted the people\r\nof Berlin to action; we only need to be reminded of Mayor Pingree's\r\npotato patches on empty city lots, our children's outing camps, our\r\noccasional children's excursions, and the like. Still, there is\r\nnothing in this country to compare with the thousands of Berlin\r\n\"arbor gardens\" and their singularly convincing force. Like a\r\ncircus, all this is supposed to be for the children, though it\r\nusually seems to need about two grown people to escort each child.\r\nThe elders enjoy the gardens even more than the circus.\r\n\r\nThe arbor gardens of Berlin should not be mistaken for the numerous\r\n\"forest schools\" (Waldschulen) in Germany. These schools \"in the\r\nwoods\" are for sickly children, both physically crippled and\r\nmentally weak. The pupils have their lessons in the open, and the\r\nteachers live, play, and work with them; long recesses separate the\r\nvarious lessons and a two-hour nap in the middle of the day out in\r\nthe open is on the time-table of every one of these schools. These\r\nspecial open-air schools for weaklings and defectives are now found\r\nin many parts of Germany, notably in Charlottenburg, Strassburg, and\r\nthe industrial regions of the Rhineland.\r\n\r\nThe example of Berlin has been followed in other German cities, such\r\nas Munich, notably in Dusseldorf on the Rhine, where the arbor\r\ngardens are called \"Schreber gardens\" in honor of the man who\r\npromoted their establishment. There is a large colony of such\r\ngardens along the Hans-Sachs street, where Lima beans, peas,\r\nlettuce, cucumbers, potatoes, and many other garden vegetables are\r\nraised; even strawberries, raspberries, and fruit trees are found\r\nhere. But the city being more lavishly provided with parks and open\r\nspaces than others of its size, the necessity for open-air life has\r\nnot made itself felt as forcibly as in Berlin.\r\n\r\nAnd think of the cleansing influence of all this. Light and air and\r\nlabor--these are the medicines not of the body only, but of the\r\nsoul. It is not ponderable things alone that are found in gardens,\r\nbut the great wonder of life, the peace of nature, the influences of\r\nsunsets and seasons and of all the intangible things to which we can\r\ngive no name, not because they are small, but because they are\r\noutside the compass of our speech. The God that dwells in gardens is\r\nsufficient for all our needs--let the theologians say what they\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n  \"'Not God! in gardens? When the eve is cool?\r\n  Nay, but I have a sign--\r\n  'Tis very sure--God walks in mine.'\"",
