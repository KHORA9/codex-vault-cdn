The first working plan of the project\r\ninvolved the concealment of a shorthand writer behind a screen in the\r\ndining-room while dinner was proceeding, and while the examination of\r\nethnological specimens or other attractive objects gave place for a time\r\nto general conversation on subjects grown interesting by age. Although\r\nthe shorthand writer was selected and is several times referred to in\r\nletters written about this period (pp. 304-307), Miss Ormerod, on due\r\nreflection, felt that the presence, though unseen, of a stranger at\r\nthese meetings _in camera_ would make the position unnatural, and\r\ndislocate the association of ideas to the detriment of the narrative.\r\n\r\nShe then bethought herself of the method of writing down at leisure\r\nmoments, from time to time as a suitable subject occurred to her, rough\r\nnotes (p. 318) to be elaborated later, and when after a time a subject\r\nhad been exhausted, the rough notes were re-written and welded into a\r\nnarrative (pp. 304-321). Some four or five of the early chapters were\r\nthus treated and then typewritten, but the remainder of the\r\nAutobiography was left in crude form, requiring much piecing together\r\nand editorial trimming. Had the book been produced on the original plan,\r\nit was proposed to name it “Recollections of Changing Times.”[1] It\r\nwould have dealt with a number of subjects of general interest, such as\r\nthe history of the Post Office, early records of floods and earthquakes,\r\nas well as newspapers of early date. The introduction of Miss Ormerod’s\r\nletters to a few of her leading correspondents was made necessary by the\r\nlack of other suitable material. The present volume is still mainly the\r\nproduct of Miss Ormerod’s pen, but with few exceptions general subjects\r\nhave been eliminated; and it forms much more a record of her works and\r\nways than it would have done had she been spared to complete it. From\r\nthe inception of the idea the present writer was appointed editor, but\r\nhad Miss Ormerod lived to see the book in the hands of the public his\r\nshare of work would have been light indeed. Armed with absolute\r\nauthority from her (p. 318) to use his discretion in the work, he has\r\nexercised his editorial license in making minor alterations without\r\nbrackets or other evidences of the editorial pen, while at the same time\r\nthe integrity of the substance has been jealously guarded.\r\n\r\nAs in Miss Ormerod’s correspondence with experts only scientific names\r\nfor insects and other scientific objects were employed, it was found\r\nexpedient to introduce the common names within ordinary or round\r\nbrackets. Much thought and care have been given to the arrangement of\r\nthe letters, and a sort of compromise was adopted of three different\r\nmethods that came up for consideration, viz., (1) according to\r\nchronological order, (2) according to the subjects discussed, and (3)\r\ngrouping under the names of the individuals to whom they were addressed.\r\nWhile the third is the predominant feature of the scheme the\r\nchronological order has been maintained within the personal groups, and\r\nprecedence in the book was generally given to the letters of the oldest\r\ndate. At the same time, to complete a subject in one group written\r\nmainly to one correspondent, letters dealing with the subject under\r\ndiscussion have been borrowed from their natural places under the\r\nheading of “Letters to Dr. ——” or “Letters to Mr. ——.” While Miss\r\nOrmerod’s practice of referring to matters of minor importance and of\r\npurely personal interest in correspondence dealing mainly with definite\r\nlines of scientific research, has not been interfered with in a few\r\ninstances, in most of the other groups of letters on technical subjects\r\neditorial pruning was freely practised to prevent confusion and to\r\nconcentrate the subject matter. The chief exceptions occur in the\r\nvoluminous and interesting correspondence with Dr. Fletcher, in her\r\nspecially confidential letters to Dr. Bethune, and in the very general\r\ncorrespondence with the editor. It was felt that to remove more of the\r\nfriendly references and passing general remarks to her correspondents\r\nwould have been to invalidate the letters and show the writer of them in\r\na character alien to her own.\r\n\r\nThe figures of insects which have been introduced into the\r\ncorrespondence, to lighten it and increase its interest to the reader,\r\nhave been chiefly borrowed from Miss Ormerod’s published works; and\r\namong them will be found a number of illustrations from Curtis’s “Farm\r\nInsects,” for the use of which her acknowledgments were fully given to\r\nMessrs. Blackie, the publishers.[2] The contents of this volume will\r\nafford ample evidence of Miss Ormerod’s intense interest in her subject,\r\nof the infinite pains she took to investigate the causes of injury, and\r\nof the untiring and unceasing efforts she employed to accomplish her\r\nobject; also that her determinations relative to the causes and nature\r\nof parasitic attacks upon crops, give proof of soundness of judgment,\r\nand her advice, chiefly connected with remedial and preventive\r\ntreatment, was eminently sensible and practical. Mainly by\r\ncorrespondence of the most friendly kind she formed a unique connecting\r\nlink between economic entomologists in all parts of the world; and she\r\nquoted their various opinions to one another very often in support of\r\nher own preconceived ideas.\r\n\r\nThe three biographical chapters, III., XI., and XII., were added to the\r\nautobiographical statements which she had left, with the object merely\r\nof supplying some missing personal incidents in an interesting life.\r\nOther deficiencies in the Autobiography are made up by Miss Ormerod’s\r\ncorrespondence, and the history of her work is permitted to evolve from\r\nher own letters.\r\n\r\nA strong vein of humour runs through many parts of her writings, notably\r\nin the chapter on “Church and Parish.” The reader will not fail to\r\nnotice the splendid courtesy and deference to scientific authority, as\r\nwell as the fullest appreciation of and unselfish sympathy with the\r\ngenuine scientific work of others, which pervades all she wrote.\r\nProminent among these characteristics of Miss Ormerod should be placed\r\nher scrupulous honesty of purpose in acknowledging to the fullest extent\r\nthe work of others.\r\n\r\nThe work of collecting material, sifting, and editing has been going on\r\nfor nearly two years, and could never have been accomplished but for the\r\nkindly help rendered by so many of Miss Ormerod’s correspondents, all of\r\nwhom I now cordially thank for invaluable sympathetic assistance.\r\nSpecial acknowledgments are due to Sir Wm. Henry Marling, Bart., the\r\npresent owner of Sedbury Park, and to Miss Ormerod’s nephews and nieces,\r\nwho have been delighted to render such assistance as could not have been\r\nfound outside the family circle. Besides Mr. Grimshaw, Mr. Janson, Dr.\r\nStewart MacDougall, Professor Hudson Beare, and Mr. T. P. Newman who\r\nread the proofs critically, last, but not least, do I thank Mr. John\r\nMurray, whose friendly reception of the first overtures made to him as\r\nthe prospective publisher of this volume brightened some of the dark\r\nmoments near the close of Miss Ormerod’s life. I have had as editor the\r\nmuch appreciated privilege of drawing, in all cases of difficulty, upon\r\nMr. Murray’s great literary experience.\r\n\r\nIn making these pleasing acknowledgments I in no way wish to shift the\r\nresponsibility as Editor from my own shoulders for defects which may be\r\ndiscovered or for the general scheme of the work, which was, with slight\r\nmodifications, my own. If it be said in criticism that the Editor is too\r\nlittle in evidence, I shall be all the more satisfied, as that has been\r\nthroughout one of his leading aims.\r\n\r\n                                                         ROBERT WALLACE.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH,\r\n\r\n          1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LIST OF ERRATA.\r\n\r\nPage   70, line 31, for “Tenebroides” read “Tenebrioides”.\r\n\r\nPage 130, line 11, for “Ceutorhyncus” read “Ceuthorhyncus”.\r\n\r\nPage 130 in description of Fig. 14, for “CEUTORHYNCUS” read\r\n          “CEUTHORHYNCUS”.\r\n\r\nPage 144, line 7, for “importad” read “imported”.\r\n\r\nPage 185, line 1, for “Lucania” read “Leucania”.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Transcriber’s note:=\r\n\r\n     These errata have been applied to this Project Gutenberg text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n   BIRTH, CHILDHOOD AND EDUCATION: Born at Sedbury Park, May,       1\r\n     1828—recollections of early childhood—First insect\r\n     observation—Girlish occupations—Education of the\r\n     family—Eleanor Ormerod’s education at home by her\r\n     mother—Interests during hours of leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n   PARENTAGE: Localities of Sedbury Park and Tyldesley, the         7\r\n     properties of George Ormerod—Roman remains—The family of\r\n     Ormerod since 1311—Three George Ormerods of Bury—Reference\r\n     to “Parentalia” by George Ormerod—The alliance of the\r\n     family with the heiress, Elizabeth Johnson of\r\n     Tyldesley—“Tyldesley’s” experiences during the Stewart\r\n     rebellion in 1745—Descent from Thomas Johnson of\r\n     Tyldesley—George Ormerod, father of Miss Ormerod—John\r\n     Latham, fellow and president of the Royal College of\r\n     Physicians, London, maternal grandfather of Miss\r\n     Ormerod—Connection with the Ardernes of Alvanley and\r\n     descent from Edward I.—The right of the Ormerod family to\r\n     the “Port Fellowship” of Brasenose College.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n   REMINISCENCES OF SEDBURY BY MISS DIANA LATHAM: The Ormerod      14\r\n     family of ten—The father and mother and their respective\r\n     interests in literature and art—Sedbury Park and the\r\n     hobbies of its inmates—Paucity of congenial\r\n     neighbours—Annual visit to London—Drives and\r\n     Excursions—The elder and the younger sections of the\r\n     family—Eleanor Ormerod’s favourite sister,\r\n     Georgiana—Interest in natural history and medicine—Miss\r\n     Ormerod at twenty-five—Routine of life at Sedbury—Drawings\r\n     by Mrs. Ormerod—The Library—Music—Models—Separation of the\r\n     family.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHURCH AND PARISH: Tidenham parish church—Leaden font—The       20\r\n     Norman Chapel of Llancaut—The history of Tidenham\r\n     Church—Curious practices in neighbouring churches—The\r\n     church as schoolroom—Pretty customs on special\r\n     occasions—The discomforts of the usual service—The choral\r\n     service on high days—No reminiscences of precocious\r\n     piety—Impressions of sermons by Scobell and\r\n     Whately—Clerical eccentricities in dress, &c.—The Oxford\r\n     Movement—Dr. Armstrong—Raising the latch of the chancel\r\n     door with a ruler—The woman’s Clothing Club of the\r\n     parish—Lending library instituted and successfully managed\r\n     by Miss G.

As a long time had elapsed since the birth of the\r\nlast of the other children (my two sisters and seven brothers), my\r\narrival could hardly have been a family comfort. Nursery arrangements,\r\nwhich had been broken up, had to be re-established. I have been told\r\nthat I started on what was to be my long life journey, with a face pale\r\nas a sheet, a quantity of black hair, and a constitution that refused\r\nanything tendered excepting a concoction of a kind of rusk made only at\r\nMonmouth. The very earliest event of which I have a clear remembrance\r\nwas being knocked down on the nursery stairs when I was three years old\r\nby a cousin of my own age. The damage was small, but the indignity\r\ngreat, and, moreover, the young man stole the lump of sugar which was\r\nmeant to console me, so the grievance made an impression. A year later a\r\nreal shock happened to my small mind. Whilst my sister, Georgiana, five\r\nyears my senior, was warming herself in the nursery, her frock caught\r\nfire. She flew down the room, threw herself on the sheepskin rug at the\r\ndoor, and rolled till the fire was put out. But she was so badly burnt\r\nthat the injuries required dressing, and this event also made a great\r\nimpression on me. Other reminiscences of pleasure and of pain come back,\r\nin thinking over those long past days, but none of such special and\r\nwonderful interest as that of being held up to see King William IV.\r\nLittle as I was, I had been taken to one of the theatres, and my father\r\ncarried me along one of the galleries, and raised me in his arms that I\r\nmight look through the glass window at the back of one of the boxes and\r\nsee His Majesty. I do not in the least believe that I saw the right man.\r\nHowever, it is something to remember that about the year 1835, if I had\r\nnot been so frightened, I might have seen the King.\r\n\r\nIn regard to any special likings of my earliest years it seems to me,\r\nfrom what I can remember or have been told, that there were signs even\r\nthen of the chief tastes which have accompanied me through life—an\r\nintense love of flowers; a fondness for insect investigation; and a\r\nfondness also for writing. In my babyhood, even before I could speak,\r\nthe sight of a bunch of flowers was the signal for both arms being held\r\nout to beg for the coveted treasure, and the taste was utilised when I\r\nwas a little older, in checking a somewhat incomprehensible failure of\r\nhealth during the spring visit of the family to London. Some one\r\nsuggested trying the effect of a supply of flower roots and seeds for me\r\nto exercise my love of gardening on, and the experiment was successful.\r\nI can remember my delight at the sight of the boxes of common garden\r\nplants—pansies, daisies, and the like; and I suppose some feeling of the\r\nrestored comfort has remained through all these years to give a charm\r\n(not peculiarly exciting in itself) to the smell of bast mats and other\r\nappurtenances of the outside of Covent Garden market.\r\n\r\nMy first insect observation I remember perfectly. It was typical of many\r\nothers since. I was quite right, absolutely and demonstrably right, but\r\nI was above my audience and fared accordingly. One day while the family\r\nwere engaged watching the letting out of a pond, or some similar matter,\r\nI was perched on a chair, and given to watch, to keep me quiet at home,\r\na tumbler of water with about half a dozen great water grubs in it. One\r\nof them had been much injured and his companions proceeded quite to\r\ndemolish him. I was exceedingly interested, and when the family came\r\nhome gave them the results of my observations, which were entirely\r\ndisbelieved. Arguing was not permitted, so I said nothing (as far as I\r\nremember); but I had made my first step in Entomology.\r\n\r\nWriting was a great pleasure. A treat was to go into the library and to\r\nsit near, without disturbing, my father, and “write a letter” on a bit\r\nof paper granted for epistolary purposes. The letter was presently\r\nsealed with one of the great armorial seals which my father wore—as\r\ngentlemen did then—in a bunch at what was called the “fob.” The whole\r\naffair must have been of a very elementary sort, but it was no bad\r\napplication of the schoolroom lessons, for thus, quite at my own free\r\nwill, I was practising the spelling of easy words, and their combination\r\ninto little sentences, and also how to bring pen, ink, and paper into\r\nconnection without necessitating an inky deluge. In those days children\r\nwere not “amused” as is the fashion now. We neither went to parties, nor\r\nwere there children’s parties at home, but I fancy we were just as\r\nhappy. As soon as possible a certain amount of lessons, given by my\r\nmother, formed the backbone of the day’s employment. In the higher\r\nbranches requisite for preparation for Public School work, my mother was\r\nso successful as to have the pleasure of receiving a special message of\r\nappreciation of her work sent to my father by Dr. Arnold, Head master of\r\nRugby. All my brothers were educated under Dr. Arnold, two as his\r\nprivate pupils, and the five younger as Rugby schoolboys, and he spoke\r\nwith great appreciation of the sound foundation which had been laid by\r\nmy mother for the school work, especially as regarded religious\r\ninstruction. From the fact of my brothers being so much older than I,\r\nthe latter point is the only one which remains in my memory; but I have\r\na clear recollection of my mother’s mustering her family class on Sunday\r\nafternoons, _i.e._, all whose age afforded her any excuse to lay hands\r\non them. Whether in the earlier foundation or more advanced work, my\r\nmother’s own great store of solid information, and her gift for\r\nimparting it, enabled her to keep us steadily progressing. Everything\r\nwas thoroughly learned, and once learned never permitted to be\r\nforgotten. Nothing was attempted that could not be well understood, and\r\nthis was expected to be mastered. In playtime we were allowed great\r\nliberty to follow our own pursuits, in which the elders of the family\r\ngenerally participated, and as we grew older we made collections (in\r\nwhich my sister Georgiana’s love of shells laid the foundation of what\r\nwas afterwards a collection of 3,000 species), and carried on\r\n“experiments,” everlasting re-arrangement of our small libraries, and\r\namateur book-binding. All imaginable ways of using our hands kept us\r\nvery happily employed indoors. Out of doors there was great enjoyment in\r\nthe pursuits which a country property gives room for, and I think I was\r\na very happy child, although I fancy what is called a “very\r\nold-fashioned” one, from not having companions of my own age.\r\n\r\nOn looking back over the years of my early childhood, the period when\r\ninstruction—commonly known as education—is imparted, it seems to me\r\nthat this followed the distinction between education and the mere\r\nacquirement of knowledge (well brought out by one of the Coleridges),\r\nand embraced the former much more fully than is the case at the\r\npresent day. There was no undue pressure on bodily or mental powers,\r\nbut the work was steady and constant. The instruction, except in\r\nmusic, was given by my mother, who had, in an eminent degree, the gift\r\nof teaching. Although at the present time home education is frequently\r\nheld up to contempt, still some recollections of my own home teaching\r\nmay be of interest. The subjects studied were those included in what\r\nis called a “solid English education.” First in order was biblical\r\nknowledge and moral precepts, practical as well as expository, which\r\nseem to have glided into my head without my being aware how, excepting\r\nin the case of the enormity of any deviation from truth. In each of\r\nthe six week-days’ work came a chapter of Scripture, read aloud, half\r\nin English, and half in French, by my sister and me. The “lessons,”\r\n_i.e._, recitation, inspection of exercises, &c., followed. The\r\nsubjects at first were few—but they were thoroughly explained.\r\nGeography, for example, was taken at first in its broad bearings,\r\nviz., countries, provinces, chief towns, mountains, rivers, and so on\r\n(what comes back to my mind as corresponding to “large print”), and\r\ngradually the “small print” was added, with as minute information as\r\nwas considered necessary. Use of the map was strictly enforced, and\r\nrepetition to impress it on the memory. I seem to hear my mother\r\ninculcating briskness in giving names of county towns—“Northumberland?\r\nNow then! quick as lightning, answer.” “Newcastle, Morpeth and\r\nAlnwick, in Northumberland”; and to enforce attention a tap of my\r\nmother’s thimble on the table, or possibly, if stupidity required\r\ngreat rousing, with more gentle application on the top of my head. If\r\nthings were bad beyond endurance, the book was sent with a skim across\r\nthe room, which had an enlivening effect; but this rarely happened. My\r\nmother gave the morning hours to the work (unless there was some\r\nhigher claim upon them, such as my father requiring her for some\r\npurpose or other) but she always declared that she would have nothing\r\nto do with the preparation of lessons in the afternoon. If all went\r\nfairly well, as usual, the passage for next day’s lesson was carefully\r\nread over at my mother’s side, and difficulties explained, and then I\r\nwas expected to learn it by myself. What we knew as “doing\r\nlessons”—which now I believe passes under the more advanced name of\r\n“preparation”—was left to my own care, and if this proved next morning\r\nnot to have been duly given I had reason to amend my ways. The\r\npreparation hour was from four to five o’clock, but if the lessons had\r\nnot been learned by that time they were expected to be done somehow,\r\nthough I think my mother was very lenient if any tolerably presentable\r\nreason were given for short measure. If the work were completed in\r\nless than the allotted time, I was allowed to amuse myself by reading\r\npoetry, of which I was excessively fond, from the great volume of\r\n“Extracts” from which my lesson had been learned. This plan seems to\r\nme to have had many advantages. For one thing, I carried the morning’s\r\nexplanations in my head till called upon, and for another, I think it\r\ngave some degree of self-reliance, as well as a habit of useful, quiet\r\nself-employment for a definite time. This was, in all reason, expected\r\nto be carefully adhered to, and I can well remember when I had hurried\r\nhome from a summer’s walk how the muscles in my legs would twitch\r\nwhilst I endeavoured to learn a French verb.\r\n\r\nOne educational detail which, as far as my experience goes, appears to\r\nhave been much better conducted in my young days than at present, was\r\nthat reading aloud to the little people had not then come into vogue. I\r\nhave no recollection of being allowed to lie about on the carpet, heels\r\nin the air, whilst some one read a book to me. There was also the\r\npeculiarity to which, if I remember rightly, Sir Benjamin Brodie\r\nattributes in his autobiography some of his success in life, viz., work\r\nwas almost continuous. There was never an interval of some weeks’\r\nholidays. A holiday was granted on some great occasion, such as the\r\nanniversary of my father and mother’s wedding-day and birthdays, and on\r\nthe birthdays of other members of the family, but (if occurring on\r\nconsecutive days) somewhat under protest; and half-holidays were not\r\nuncommon in summer. These consisted of my being excused the afternoon\r\npreparation of lessons, and as the pretext for asking was generally the\r\nweather’s being “so very fine,” I conjecture it was thought that an\r\nextra run in the fresh air was perhaps a healthy variety of occupation.\r\nAny way, the learning lost must have been small, for excepting the\r\nwritten part of the work the lessons were expected to appear next\r\nmorning in perfect form, however miscellaneously acquired. One way or\r\nother there were occasional breaks by pleasant episodes such as picnics,\r\non fine summer days, to one of the many old ruined castles, or disused\r\nlittle Monmouthshire churches, or Roman remains in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhere my father worked up the material for some forthcoming\r\narchæological essay and my mother executed some of her beautiful\r\nsketches (plate VI.). The carriage-load of young ones enjoyed themselves\r\nexceedingly, and prevented the work from becoming monotonous or\r\nburdensome. And there were joyful days before and after going from home,\r\nand now and then, when it was impossible for my mother to give her\r\nmorning up to the work, if she had not appointed one of the elder of the\r\nyoung fry her deputy for the occasion. I remember, too, that I took my\r\nbook in play hours, when and where I wished; sometimes on a fine summer\r\nafternoon the “where” might be sitting on a horizontal bough of a large\r\nold Portugal laurel in the garden. And I fancy that the perch in the\r\nfresh air, with the green light shimmering round me, was as good for my\r\nbodily health (by no means robust) as my entertaining little book for my\r\nprogress in reading.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable the small quantity of food which it was at one time\r\nthought the right thing for ladies to take in public. I suppose from\r\nearly habit, my mother, who was active both in body and mind, used to\r\neat very little. At lunch she would divide a slice of meat with me.\r\nAlthough now the death, in her confinement, of the Princess Charlotte,\r\n“the people’s darling,” which plunged the nation in sorrow, is a thing\r\nonly of history, yet it is on record how she almost implored for more\r\nfood, the special desire being mutton chops. Though not in any way\r\nconnected with the Royal Family, my mother held in memory the unhappy\r\nevent from its consequences. Sir Richard Croft, whose medical attentions\r\nhad been so inefficient to the Princess, was shortly after called to\r\nattend in a similar capacity on Mrs. Thackeray, wife of Dr. Thackeray,\r\nthen or after Provost of King’s College, Cambridge. For some reason or\r\nother he left his patient for a while, and the story went that, finding\r\npistols in the room where he was resting, he shot himself. Miss\r\nCotton—Mrs. Thackeray’s sister—was a friend of my mother. Miss\r\nThackeray, the infant who was ushered into the world by the death of\r\nboth her mother and the doctor, survived, and in her young-lady days was\r\nparticularly fond of dancing; and I have the remembrance of my first\r\nLondon ball being at her aunt’s house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n       PLATE I.\r\n  SEDBURY PARK HOUSE AND GROUNDS, DISTANT VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MANSION HOUSE, SEDBURY PARK; MISS GEORGIANA ORMEROD ON THE LEFT, MISS\r\n    ELEANOR ORMEROD ON THE RIGHT.\r\n  (_pp. 14, 48._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                               PARENTAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation of Sedbury (plate I.), rising to an elevation of about 170\r\nfeet between the Severn and the Wye, opposite Chepstow, was very\r\nbeautiful, and the vegetation rich and luxuriant. My father purchased\r\nthe house and policy grounds from Sir Henry Cosby about 1826, and it was\r\nour home till his death in 1873. He retained Tyldesley, his other\r\nproperty in Lancashire, with its coal mines, but we did not reside\r\nthere, as the climate was too cold for the health of my mother and for\r\nthe young family.\r\n\r\n[The original purchase was called Barnesville, and earlier still\r\nKingston Park, and it consisted of a moderate-sized villa with the\r\nimmediately adjoining grounds. The property was added to by purchases\r\nfrom the Duke of Beaufort, and it was renamed Sedbury Park after the\r\nnearest village. To the house the new owner added a handsome colonnade\r\nabout 10 feet wide, and a spacious library. Sir Robert Smirke, the\r\narchitect of all the improvements, was the man who designed the British\r\nMuseum, the General Post Office, &c.[3] Barnes Cottage on the property,\r\nat one time ‘Barons Cottage,’ was kept in habitable repair because it\r\nsecured to the estate the privilege of a seat in church.]\r\n\r\nAbout sixteen miles from Sedbury Park are still to be seen the\r\ninteresting ruins of the Great Roman station of this part of the\r\ncountry, Caerwent or the white tower, the Venta Silurum of Antonine’s\r\n“Itinerary.”[4] Its trade and military importance were transferred to\r\nStrigul, now known as Chepstow, after the Norman Conquest. Sedbury Park\r\nis believed to have been an outlying post of this chief military centre,\r\nand it was occupied by soldiers “guarding the beacon and the look-out\r\nover the passages” of the Severn. Considerable finds of Roman pottery\r\n(plate XI.) were discovered about 1860, while drains about 4 feet deep\r\nwere being cut near to the Severn cliffs. They consisted chiefly of\r\nfragments of rough earthenware—cooking dishes and cinerary urns, &c.\r\nThere was also a small quantity of glazed, red Samian cups and one piece\r\nof Durobrivian ware and great quantities of animals’ teeth and bones,\r\nbut no coins (p. 174). After the death of my father it was found that\r\nmuch of the best ware had been stolen.\r\n\r\nMy father (plate II.) is well known for the high place he takes amongst\r\nour English County historians, as the author of “The History of the\r\nCounty Palatine, and City of Chester,” published in 1818. He came of the\r\nold Lancashire family of Ormerod of Ormerod, a demesne in the township\r\nof Cliviger, a wild and mountainous district, situated along the\r\nboundaries of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The varied watershed\r\n(transmitting the streams to the eastern and western seas); the beauties\r\nof the rocks and waterfalls; the shaded glens, and the antique\r\nfarmhouses (where fairy superstition still lingered till the beginning\r\nof the past century), have been written about by Whitaker in his\r\n“History of Whalley.”[5] There, in the year 1810, in an elevated\r\nposition, amongst aged pine and elm trees, and surrounded by high garden\r\nwalls of dark stone, the mansion, (plate XXVIII.)—since greatly enlarged\r\nby the family of the present proprietor—stood in a dingle at the side of\r\na mountain stream, which rushed behind it at a considerable depth.\r\nBeyond the stream, the rise of the ground to the more elevated moors\r\nincludes a view of the summit of Pendle Hill, of exceedingly evil repute\r\nfor meetings of witches and warlocks, and congenerous unpleasantnesses,\r\nin the olden time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE II.\r\n  GEORGE ORMEROD, ESQ., D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., F.S.A.,\r\n  OF SEDBURY PARK, GLOUCESTERSHIRE, AND TYLDESLEY, LANCASHIRE,\r\n  FATHER OF MISS ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n  _From a painting after Jackson, date circa 1820._\r\n  (_pp: 11, 14._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe family of Ormerod was settled in the locality from which they took\r\ntheir name, as far back as the year 1311, the estates continuing in\r\ntheir possession until, in 1793 (by the marriage of Charlotte Ann\r\nOrmerod, sole daughter and heiress of Laurence Ormerod, the last of the\r\ngeneration of the parent stem in direct male descent), they passed to\r\nColonel John Hargreaves; and by the marriage of his eldest daughter and\r\nco-heiress, Eleanor Mary, with the Rev. William Thursby, they became\r\nvested in the Thursby family,[6] represented until recently by Sir John\r\nHardy Thursby, Bart., of Ormerod House, Burnley, Lancashire, and\r\nHolmhurst, Christchurch, Hants. Sir John showed thoughtful,\r\nphilanthropic feeling to his Lancashire district, by presenting the land\r\nfor a public park to Burnley, and, in connection with his family, he\r\nalso gave the site for the neighbouring “Victoria Hospital.” In 1887, he\r\nserved as High Sheriff of Lancashire, and was created Baronet. Dying on\r\nMarch 16, 1901, he was succeeded by his eldest son, John Ormerod\r\nScarlett Thursby, of Bankhall, Burnley, who, in his surname and\r\nbaptismal names, keeps alive the connection with the old family stock\r\nand the families with which the last two co-heiresses of Ormerod were\r\nconnected by marriage. With these matters of possessions, however, the\r\ncollateral branch of Ormerod, of Bury in Lancashire (from the special\r\nfounder of which my father was descended in direct male line), had\r\nnothing to do. From Oliver Ormerod, who became permanently resident at\r\nBury shortly after the close of the seventeenth century, descended his\r\nonly son, George Ormerod of Bury, merchant. From him descended George\r\nOrmerod (an only child), who died on October 7, 1785, a few days before\r\nthe birth of his only child—my father—yet another George Ormerod. In a\r\nmere statement of the names of the representatives of successive\r\ngenerations, of whom no specially distinguishing points appear to have\r\nbeen recorded, there is, perhaps, little of general interest. But\r\npossibly some amount of interest attaches to the proofs of\r\nrepresentatives of one family having lived quietly on from generation to\r\ngeneration in one locality since the early part of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The connections and intermarrying of the Ormerods with many of\r\nthe Lancashire families of former days give the subject a county\r\ninterest to those who care to search out the genealogical, historical\r\nand heraldic details given at great length in my father’s volume of\r\n“Parentalia.” Here and there some member of the family appears to have\r\ncome before the world, as in the case of Oliver Ormerod, M.A., noted as\r\na profound scholar, theologian, and Puritan controversialist, and author\r\nof two polemical works—one entitled “The Picture of a Puritan,”\r\npublished in 1605, and the other “The Picture of a Papist,” published in\r\n1606. Oliver Ormerod was presented to the Rectory of Norton Fitzwarren,\r\nCo. Somerset, by William Bourchier, third Earl of Bath, and afterwards\r\nto the Rectory of Huntspill in the same county, where he died in the\r\nyear 1625.\r\n\r\nSomething, however, occurred in 1784 of much interest to our own branch\r\nof the family, leading subsequently to great increase of property, and\r\nlikewise in some degree, connecting us with the Jacobite troubles of\r\n1745. This was the marriage of my grandfather with Elizabeth, second\r\ndaughter of Thomas Johnson, of Tyldesley. Thomas Johnson (my great\r\ngrandfather) having married, secondly, Susannah, daughter and co-heiress\r\nof Samuel Wareing, of Bury and Walmersley, got with her considerable\r\nestates, inherited from the Wareings, the Cromptons of Hacking, and\r\nNuthalls of Golynrode. On the occasion of the march of Charles Stewart\r\nto Manchester in 1745, “Tyldesley”—to use the form of appellation often\r\ngiven from property in those days—suffered many hardships. As one of the\r\nfive treasurers who had undertaken to receive Lancashire subscriptions\r\nin aid of the reigning monarch, King George the Second, and as an\r\ninfluential local friend of the cause, he was one of those who suffered\r\nthe infliction of domiciliary military visitation, and also threat of\r\ntorture by burning his hands to induce him to give up government papers\r\nand money in his possession. I have still in my house (1901) the large\r\nhanging lamp of what is now called “Old Manchester” glass, which lighted\r\nthe dining-room when my great grandfather stood so steadily to his trust\r\nthat although the straw had been brought for the purpose of torture (or\r\nto terrify him into submission) extremities were not proceeded to. He\r\nwas ultimately left a prisoner on parole, in his house, until released\r\nin December, 1745, in consequence of the retreat of the rebel army. But\r\ndisagreeable as this state of things must have been at the best, it was\r\nto some degree lightened by kindness (or at least absence of unnecessary\r\nannoyance) on the part of the Jacobite officers, of whom stories\r\nremained in the family to my own time. One especial point was their\r\nkindness to my eldest great aunt,[7] then a little child, whom they used\r\nto take on their knees to show her what she described as their “little\r\nguns.” The drinking of the healths of the rival princes, which probably\r\noften led to a less peaceful ending, was mentioned by my father in his\r\nHistory of Cheshire, as a notable instance of consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE III.\r\n  FAMILY GROUP—GEORGE ORMEROD AS A CHILD; HIS MOTHER SEATED BEHIND HIM;\r\n    HER BROTHER, THOMAS JOHNSON, ESQ., OF TYLDESLEY, LANCASHIRE,\r\n    STANDING; AND THEIR MOTHER SEATED ON THE RIGHT.\r\n\r\n  _Composition from miniature, circa 1780._\r\n]\r\n\r\n“On one occasion when the Scotch officers who caroused in their\r\nprisoner’s house, had given their usual toast KING JAMES, and the host\r\non request had followed with his, and undauntedly proposed KING GEORGE,\r\nsome rose, and touched their swords; but a senior officer exclaimed, ‘He\r\nhas drunk our Prince, why should we not drink his? Here’s to the Elector\r\nof Hanover.’”[8]\r\n\r\nDuring the disturbed time, when any one bearing the appearance of a\r\nmessenger would assuredly have been seized with the papers which he\r\ncarried, the difficulty of transmitting information was met by the\r\nemployment at night of two greyhounds trained for the service. The\r\ndocuments were fastened to the animals and thus carried safely to the\r\nadherent’s house, from which as opportunity offered they could be passed\r\non. The greyhounds, having been well fed as a reward and encouragement\r\nto future good behaviour, were started off on their return journey. In\r\nthe present day this plan of transmission would very soon be discovered,\r\nbut in those times the nature of the country, the nocturnal hours\r\nchosen, and also the deeply-rooted superstitions of the district, all\r\nhelped to make the four-footed messengers very trusty carriers.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 Thomas Johnson served as Sheriff of Lancashire. He died in 1763,\r\nleaving a widow (who survived him until 1798), one son, and three\r\ndaughters—the only survivors of a family of eleven children, of whom\r\nseven died in infancy, three on the day of their birth. Of the four\r\nchildren who reached maturity, Elizabeth, the second daughter (plate\r\nIII.) married my grandfather, George Ormerod of Bury, at the Collegiate\r\nChurch, Manchester, on the 18th of October, 1784. He died in 1785, a\r\nfortnight before the birth of my father, who was the sole issue of this\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nMy father, George Ormerod (plate II.), heir to his grandfather, was born\r\nOctober 20, 1785. He was co-heir of, and successor to the estates of his\r\nmaternal uncle in 1823, and sole heir to his surviving maternal aunt in\r\n1839. He was D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S., F.S.A., and a magistrate for the\r\ncounties of Cheshire, Gloucester, and Monmouth. On August 2, 1808, he\r\nmarried my mother, Sarah, eldest daughter of John Latham, Bradwall Hall,\r\nCheshire, Fellow and sometime President of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians, Harley Street, London.[9]\r\n\r\nMy grandfather in the female line, John Latham, M.D., F.R.S. (plate\r\nIV.), the eldest son of the Rev. John Latham, came of an old family\r\nstock, and was born in 1761 in the rectory house at Gawsworth, Cheshire.\r\nHe was educated first at Manchester Grammar School, and thence proceeded\r\n(with the view of studying for orders) to Brasenose College, Oxford, but\r\nthe strong bent of his own wishes towards the medical profession induced\r\nhim to alter his plans, and he took his degree of M.D. on October 10,\r\n1788. “His first professional years were passed at Manchester and\r\nOxford, where he was physician to the respective infirmaries. In 1788 he\r\nremoved to London, was admitted Fellow of the College of Physicians, and\r\nelected successively physician to the Middlesex, the Magdalen, and St.\r\nBartholomew Hospitals. In 1795 he was appointed Physician Extraordinary\r\nto the Prince of Wales, and reappointed to the same office on the\r\nPrince’s accession to the throne as George IV. In 1813 Dr. Latham was\r\nelected President of the College of Physicians; in 1816, founded the\r\nMedical Benevolent Society; and in 1829 finally left London, retiring to\r\nhis estate at Bradwall Hall, where he died on April 20, 1843, in the\r\neighty-second year of his age.”\r\n\r\nHe indulged in the practical pleasures of country life, and maintained a\r\nhome farm, on which he kept a dairy of sixty cows. He was a man of great\r\nforce of character and of decisive action. On one occasion a man who had\r\nbeen told that if he returned he would be summarily ejected, came back\r\nto crave an audience. On being reminded of the fact he pleaded, “Oh!\r\ndoctor, you do not really mean it.” “Yes, I do,” was the prompt reply as\r\nan order was given to the butler to turn the intruder out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE IV.\r\n  JOHN LATHAM, ESQ., M.D., F.R.S., PHYSICIAN EXTRAORDINARY TO GEORGE\r\n    IV., MATERNAL GRANDFATHER OF MISS ORMEROD, IN HIS ROBES AS PRESIDENT\r\n    OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, 1813 TO 1819.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDr. Latham married, in 1784, Mary, eldest daughter and co-heiress of the\r\nRev. Peter Mayer, Vicar of Prestbury, Cheshire, by whom he had numerous\r\nchildren, of whom three sons and two daughters lived to maturity. My\r\nmother, his eldest daughter, survived him, as did also her brothers. Of\r\nthese the second son, Peter Mere Latham, M.D., of Grosvenor-street,\r\nWestminster, one of Her Majesty’s Physicians Extraordinary, was long\r\nwell known as an eminent consulting physician regarding diseases of the\r\nchest, until his own severe sufferings from asthma obliged him to retire\r\nto Torquay, where he died on July 20, 1875.\r\n\r\nFrom our being related to John Latham and his wife, Mary Mayer (although\r\nin point of rank the difference was so enormous between the head from\r\nwhom we could trace and ourselves), it is permissible to allude to our\r\nconnection with the family of Arderne of Alvanley, and consequent\r\ndescent from King Edward the First and his wife, Eleanor of Castile.\r\nThis gave us our claim of “founder’s kin” in the election to the “Port\r\nFellowship” of Brasenose College, to which distinction in my time my\r\nbrother— Rev. John Arderne Ormerod—was elected. He was the last Port\r\nFellow on the above foundation. The record of each generation will be\r\nfound in the genealogical table of “Arderne” in my father’s\r\n“Parentalia,” and also on reference to the pedigrees of the many\r\nfamilies of which members are named in the “History of Cheshire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n           REMINISCENCES OF SEDBURY BY MISS DIANA LATHAM[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy cousin Eleanor Anne Ormerod was the youngest of a family of ten—seven\r\nbrothers and three sisters—all clever, energetic creatures, and gifted\r\nwith a strong sense of humour. A large family always creates a peculiar\r\natmosphere for itself; it also breaks up into detachments of elder and\r\nyounger growth, and the elder members are beginning to take places in\r\nthe world before the younger are out of the schoolroom. Eleanor’s eldest\r\nbrother was a Church dignitary while she was still a child, teased and\r\npetted by her young medical student brothers, and the darling of her\r\nelder sister Georgiana. The father and mother of this numerous flock\r\nwere both remarkable people. Mr. Ormerod, historian and antiquary,\r\nalways occupied with literary or topographical research, was an autocrat\r\nin his own family and intolerant of any shortcomings or failings that\r\ncame under his notice. He could, however, on occasion, relax and tell\r\nhumorous stories to children. The family discipline was strict; the\r\nyounger members were expected to yield obedience to the elders, and it\r\nwas said that the spaniel Guy (he came from Warwick), who ranked as one\r\nof the children, always obeyed the eldest of the family present. My aunt\r\nhad a large share of the milk of human kindness added to much practical\r\ncommon sense and a touch of artistic genius in her composition; it was\r\nfrom her that her daughters inherited their eye for colour and dexterity\r\nof touch. Mr. Ormerod was a neat draughtsman of architectural subjects,\r\nbut my aunt had taste and skill and a delight in her own branch of\r\nart—flower painting—that lasted all her life.\r\n\r\nSedbury Park (plate I.) was a beautiful home; the house, a handsome\r\nfamily mansion with comfortable old-fashioned furniture, good and\r\ninteresting pictures, old china, and a splendid library, afforded also\r\nample space for its inmates to follow their various hobbies, and many\r\nwere the arts and crafts practised there at various times. The\r\ncarpenter’s bench, the lathe, wood-carving, electro-typing, modelling\r\nand casting for models each had their turn, and in all this strenuous\r\nplay Eleanor had her full share. Society played a very secondary part in\r\nlife at Sedbury; calls were exchanged with county neighbours at due\r\nintervals, and there was some intimacy with Copleston, Bishop of\r\nLlandaff, the Bathursts of Lydney Park, and the Horts of Hardwicke. But\r\nthough Mr. Ormerod attended to his duties as magistrate, and went duly\r\nto meetings of the bench at Chepstow, he was quite without sympathy for\r\nfield sports and the pursuits of his brother magistrates. He was\r\nabsorbed in his own studies, and something of a recluse by nature.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Miss Ormerod has herself written of the elaborateness of the\r\narrangements and the great formality which were associated with the\r\nregular county dinner party, the chief method of entertainment at\r\nSedbury sixty years ago. She referred to the anxieties experienced lest\r\nthe coach should not arrive in time with the indispensables including\r\nfish—“the distance of Sedbury from London involving twenty-four hours or\r\nmore of transmission in weather favourable or otherwise.” Miss Ormerod\r\ncontinues:—\r\n\r\n“One very important matter in the far gone past times in the arrangement\r\nof the dinner table, was the removal of the great cloth and of two\r\ncloths laid, one at each side, just wide enough to occupy the uncovered\r\nspace before the guests, and long enough to reach from one end of the\r\ntable to the other. The removal required a deal of care and dexterity,\r\nand I do not think it was practised at many other houses in our\r\nneighbourhood. When the table was to be cleared for dessert of course\r\neverything was removed, including the great tablecloth itself—one of the\r\nhandsomest of the family possessions, and of considerable length when\r\nthere were the usual number of about eighteen or twenty guests. The\r\noperation was performed as follows:—The butler placed himself at the end\r\nof each strip successively, and a few of the house servants or of those\r\nwho came with guests along each side. The butler drew the slips in turn\r\nand the servants took care there should be no hitch in the passage of\r\nthe cloths, and so each was nicely gathered up.\r\n\r\n“But the removal of the great tablecloth which was the next operation\r\nwas a more difficult matter. The great heavy central epergne of rosewood\r\nhad to be lifted a little way up by a strong man-servant or two, whilst\r\nthe tablecloth was slipped from beneath it and the cloth was started on\r\nits travels down the table till it came into the hands of the butler,\r\nwho gathered it up. The beautifully polished table then appeared in full\r\nlustre. The shining surface sparkled excellently and presently reflected\r\nthe bright silver and glass and the fruit and flowers with a brilliance\r\nwhich to my thinking was much more beautiful than the arrangement of\r\nlater days.”]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe annual visit to London was a great delight to my aunt, who enjoyed\r\nmeetings with her own family and friends, and visits to exhibitions, &c.\r\nHer husband had always occupation in the British Museum, and her\r\ndaughters took painting and other lessons. Mary, the eldest, was a pupil\r\nof Copley Fielding; Georgiana (plate XXVII.), and Eleanor later, had\r\nlessons from Hunt and learnt from him how to combine birds’ nests and\r\nobjects of still life with fruits and flowers into very lovely pictures.\r\nBoth were excellent artists with a slight difference in style:\r\nGeorgiana’s pictures had great harmony of colour and composition;\r\nEleanor’s had more _chic_. Hunt was a very touchy little man—almost a\r\ndwarf—and if by any chance my aunt did not see him and bow as she drove\r\npast he cherished resentment for days after. At Sedbury driving tours or\r\npicnic excursions to the ruined castles and other objects of interest\r\n(plates V., XVI., XXV.), in the neighbourhood were frequent, and the\r\nsketches that resulted were often reproduced as zincographs. Now and\r\nthen a tour abroad was achieved, but such tours were few and far\r\nbetween. The beautiful copy of Correggio’s “Marriage of St. Catherine”\r\nwhich ultimately became Eleanor’s property, was acquired on a visit to\r\nParis and the Louvre.\r\n\r\nThis self-contained family life did not lead to the marriage of the\r\ndaughters, and three only of the seven sons married—one very late in\r\nlife. Mary, the Princess Royal of the family, was the centre of the\r\nfirst group—herself and four brothers; Georgiana that of the second,\r\nconsisting of two brothers older than herself, one younger, and Eleanor.\r\nGeorgiana was a most lovable person; she always believed in her younger\r\nsister’s capacity and in her projects, which were not approved of nor\r\ntaken seriously by some of her elders, and could not have been carried\r\nout until after the break up of the home on the death of Mr. Ormerod.\r\nMeantime, the naturalist element in Eleanor was free to lay up knowledge\r\nfor future use, and her country life gave leisure and opportunity for\r\nobservation of bird, plant, and insect life, to say nothing of reptiles.\r\nAny snake killed on the estate was brought to Eleanor, and if it was\r\nremarkable for size or beauty she took a cast of it to be afterwards\r\nelectrotyped, or had it buried in an ant-hill in order to set up its\r\nskeleton when the ants had cleaned the bones. The casts, which resembled\r\nbronze, were sometimes attached to slabs of green Devonshire marble, and\r\nmade handsome paper weights. Wasps were at one time a subject of special\r\nstudy and interest to her brother Dr. Edward Ormerod, and she and\r\nGeorgiana once conveyed a wasp’s nest to him at Brighton. I believe he\r\ndid not allow the wasps to exceed a certain number, out of consideration\r\nfor the neighbouring fruiterers.\r\n\r\nThe premature deaths of Edward and William, physician and surgeon, were\r\nheartfelt sorrows to the two sisters nearest in age. If Eleanor’s lot\r\nhad been cast in later days she might have become a lady doctor of\r\nrenown; she had many qualifications for the medical profession and a\r\nliking for domestic surgery; she had strong nerves and inspired\r\nconfidence and used to say that she never went a journey without some\r\nfellow-passenger going into a detailed account of all her ailments.\r\nBesides strong nerves she had strong eye-sight and a delicate but firm\r\ntouch. Her brothers did not encourage anatomical studies, but she could\r\nprepare sections of teeth and other objects for the microscope as\r\nbeautifully as any professional microscopist. Some of my cousins were\r\nstrong sighted and very short-sighted, and much inclined to be sceptical\r\nas to my long-sighted vision.\r\n\r\nMy last visit to Sedbury was in the autumn of 1853 in company with my\r\nstep-sister Margaret Roberts, then just beginning to try her powers as\r\nan authoress. Eleanor must then have been twenty-five or twenty-six, but\r\nwas considered to be quite young by her family, and in some respects was\r\nreally so. She no longer played such pranks as embarking in a tub to\r\nnavigate the horse pond, but her fine dark eyes would shine with\r\nmischief, and she was the licensed jester to the family circle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE V.\r\n  RUINS OF TINTERN ABBEY, MONMOUTHSHIRE.\r\n  _Frith photo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe routine of life at Sedbury usually began, on the part of the younger\r\nmembers of the family, with a walk after breakfast prefaced by a visit\r\nto the poultry yard and greenhouses. Georgiana was chief hen-wife, and\r\nkept an account of the eggs and chickens. The park, lying on high ground\r\nbetween the Severn and the Wye, had beautiful points of view and fine\r\ntimber, and there were lovely views beyond its precincts. “Offa’s Dyke”\r\nran through a corner of the estate, and the discovery of some Roman\r\npottery in its neighbourhood had given my cousins much occupation in\r\nsticking broken fragments together and re-building them into vases\r\n(plate XI.). Our most beautiful walk, rather too long for the morning\r\nstrolls, was to the “double view,” a projecting promontory above the Wye\r\nwhere the river curves and from whence a lovely view is visible both up\r\nand down the stream. From the morning walk we always brought back\r\nsomething from hedge or field for my aunt to draw as she lay on her sofa\r\nwith her drawing table across it. She was then in failing health, but\r\nstill able to draw, and she used to make studies of flowers in pencil on\r\ngrey paper, touching in the high light with Chinese white. Each drawing\r\nwhen finished was shut up in a large book, and there kept until some\r\ngathering of the family took place, when the drawings were produced and\r\na lottery ensued, each person choosing a drawing in turn according to\r\nthe number on the ticket they had drawn. I have a book of these\r\nbeautiful drawings (plate VI.) which I greatly prize. In her youthful\r\ndays she had painted in oils, and there were some fine copies of Dutch\r\nflower pictures in the drawing-room made by her. In later life the care\r\nof her large family left scant time for Art, but she cherished it in her\r\ndaughters, and it was again a resource in her advanced age. The great\r\nsculptor Flaxman was a friend of her father and had encouraged her\r\nyouthful efforts in Art. She had amazing industry and had copied many of\r\nhis designs on wood as furniture decorations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE VI.\r\n  PORTION OF NORMAN WORK FROM CHEPSTOW PARISH CHURCH.\r\n  _From a drawing by Mrs. Ormerod, 1844._\r\n  (_p. 6._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nGeorgiana and Eleanor usually had some painting or other industry on\r\nhand, or copying to do for their father. In the afternoon we often took\r\na drive and were taken to see Tintern or the Wynd Cliff or some other\r\npoint of interest. After dinner we sat in the library, a fine room with\r\na splendid collection of books shut up in wire bookcases. Each member of\r\nthe family had a key to the imprisoned books, but a visitor felt that to\r\nget one extracted for personal use was rather a ceremony. The beautiful\r\nillustrated books were brought out for the evening’s entertainment and\r\nthen safely housed again. On Sundays we walked or drove to Tidenham\r\nChurch, a “little grey church on a windy hill” (plate VII.). We took a\r\nwalk in the afternoon, and in the evening Mr. Ormerod read a sermon in\r\nthe library to us and the servants. Such was the routine of life that\r\nautumn at Sedbury. At the time of our visit, the Gloucester Musical\r\nFestival was going on, but there was no thought of going to hear it. In\r\nlater years Eleanor possessed a good piano and studied the theory of\r\nmusic, but I think that was prompted by her general cleverness and\r\nactivity of intellect rather than by any special gift for music. She was\r\nteaching herself Latin during our visit, and as time went on she\r\nacquired other languages. She made beautiful models of fruits by a\r\nprocess of her own invention. A collection of these was sent to an\r\nInternational Exhibition at St. Petersburg and she acquired sufficient\r\nknowledge of Russian to correspond with the department of the Exhibition\r\nreceiving them.\r\n\r\nAfter the break-up of the Sedbury home, consequent on the death of Mr.\r\nOrmerod, who survived his wife[11] for many years, Mary bought the lease\r\nof a house in Exeter and settled there for the rest of her life; the two\r\nyounger sisters took a house for three years in Torquay, where we were\r\nthen living as well as their, and our, old and beloved uncle, Dr. Mere\r\nLatham. Wishing to be nearer London, they removed to Isleworth and some\r\nyears later to Torrington House, St. Alban’s, where they spent the\r\nremaining years of their lives.\r\n\r\n                                                           DIANA LATHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                           CHURCH AND PARISH\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Parish Church (plate VII.), that is to say, the Church of St. Mary\r\nthe Virgin, Tidenham, Gloucestershire, in which parish my father’s\r\nSedbury property was situated, was of considerable antiquarian interest,\r\nas, although the hamlet of Churchend in which it stands is not mentioned\r\nin the Saxon survey of 956, the original church was in existence in the\r\nyear 1071. The fabric of the church when I knew it was of later date,\r\nand, as shown by the accompanying sketch, chiefly in the architecture of\r\nthe fourteenth century, excepting the south doorways of the nave and\r\nchancel and the tall narrow trefoil-headed windows in the north aisle.\r\nThe chief point of archæological interest, however, lies in its\r\npossession of a leaden font (plate VII.) in perfect repair, referable\r\nfrom its style to the transition period of Saxon and Anglo-Norman\r\narchitecture, and considered not likely to be more recent in date than\r\nthe eleventh century. The subject derives additional interest from the\r\ncircumstance of the precise correspondence of this font in Tidenham\r\nChurch with the leaden font in the church of the adjoining small parish\r\nof Llancaut, making it demonstrably certain that both the fonts were\r\ncast from the same mould.[12] The decorations on the fonts are in _mezzo\r\nrelievo_. These consist of figures and foliage ranged alternately, in\r\ntwelve compartments, under ornamental, semi-circular arches resting on\r\npillars; the design—two arches containing figures alternating with two\r\narches containing foliage—being thrice repeated. The details will be\r\nbetter understood from the accompanying plate than from verbal\r\ndescription, but may be stated as representing respectively under each\r\nof the two thrice-repeated arches a venerable figure seated on a throne,\r\nthe first of the two holding a sealed book, the second raising his hand\r\nas in the act of benediction, after removal of the seal from a similar\r\nbook which is grasped in his hand. Each of these figures was considered\r\nto represent the Second Person of the Trinity.[13] On this point I am\r\nnot qualified to offer an opinion, but whatever may be the case as to\r\necclesiastical adaptation in the representation in the second of the two\r\nfigures, the first of the throned figures appears to coincide with the\r\ndescription of the vision of the Deity, given in the “Revelation” of St.\r\nJohn, chap. V. verse 1,[14] rather than with any representation of “The\r\nLamb” that “stood,” as it had been slain, and “came and took the book\r\nout of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne” (verses 6 and 7\r\nof the chapter quoted).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE VII.\r\n  LEADEN FONT IN TIDENHAM CHURCH.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHURCH OF ST. MARY THE VIRGIN, TIDENHAM, GLOUCESTERSHIRE.\r\n  THE VAULT ON S.E. SIDE OF THE CHURCH, ABOUT 15 FT. SQUARE,\r\n  IS THE GRAVE OF MISS ORMEROD’S FATHER AND MOTHER.\r\n  _From a sketch by Miss Georgiana E. Ormerod._\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe illustration is taken from very careful “rubbings” of the Tidenham\r\nFont. The Llancaut font has suffered considerable damage, and likewise\r\nthe loss of two of the original twelve compartments. These had\r\npresumably been removed to make the font more suitable to the\r\nexceedingly small size of the little Norman chapel (plate VIII.). This\r\nchurch, which in my time was almost disused, measured only about 40 feet\r\nin length by 12 in breadth, and possessed nothing of an architectural\r\ncharacter, excepting one small round-headed window at the east end, with\r\nplain cylindrical side shafts without capitals, and a small cinquefoil\r\npiscina. The situation, on one of the crooks of the Wye, and just above\r\nthe river, is romantic in the extreme. The ground rapidly slopes down to\r\nit from above, clothed with woodland from the level of the top of the\r\nprecipitous cliffs which rise almost immediately beside it to a great\r\nheight above the river. Access on that side is thus only possible by\r\nboat, or by a rough way, known as the Fisherman’s Path, along the front\r\nof the cliffs. Nevertheless, because of the exceeding picturesqueness of\r\nthe spot, it was a favourite resort on the twelve Sundays in the year on\r\nwhich (I believe under some legal necessity) service was there, in my\r\ntime, performed. The scene, on the only occasion I was ever present\r\n(when our parish church was closed), might have furnished an excellent\r\nsubject for a painting, as the congregation (far too many for the little\r\nchurch to hold), in their bright Sunday dress, emerged from the sloping\r\nglades or woodland, to the open space close by the church. Comfort was a\r\nmatter of minor importance. Those who disposed themselves on the grass,\r\nwhere they had full enjoyment of the fresh summer air, and heard,\r\nthrough the open door, as much of the service as they chose to listen\r\nto, doubtless enjoyed themselves, but within it was not so agreeable.\r\nThe squire’s family were of course installed in _the_ pew, and there we\r\nwere packed as tightly as could be managed, so that we all had to get up\r\nand sit down together. We had a “strange clergyman,” reported to be of\r\nvast learning; and my juvenile terror, along with my physical condition\r\nfrom squeezing, has imprinted the morning’s performance on my\r\nrecollection as something truly wretched.\r\n\r\nThere being no resident population the chapel has since fallen into\r\nruin, and the font and bell have been removed to the mother parish of\r\nWoolastone, the bell now doing duty at the day-school there. In 1890 Sir\r\nWilliam H. Marling, Bart. (patron of the living) carefully restored the\r\nfont and placed within it a brass plate bearing the following\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Perantiquum hunc fontem baptismalem e ruinis sacelli scī Jacobi\r\n    Lancaut in comū Gloucē servatum refecit Guls̄ Hes̄ Marling Bars̄\r\n    A.D, 1890.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe venerable relic stands in the hall at Sedbury Park.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE VIII.\r\n  NORMAN CHAPEL, LLANCAUT, WYE CLIFFS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe history of the “Church” in our parish of Tidenham, whether\r\ninterpreted as the body of believers or the building in which they\r\nworshipped, might be well taken, during about the fifty middle years of\r\nthe past century, as an illustration of “changing times.” In the year\r\n1826—or thereabouts—when my father purchased the property, Tidenham\r\nChurch was no exception to many other churches in rural districts. The\r\ninterior comes back to my remembrance as dark, dingy, and very decidedly\r\ndamp, as shown by the green mould on pillars and walls. One of the first\r\nimprovements was the placing of two good stoves in the church,—one\r\npresented by my father, and the other (rather, I believe, against local\r\nwishes) by the Parish. I well remember the presence of the stoves, as it\r\nwas considered by the churchwardens, or whoever arranged these matters,\r\nthat the time which was most decorous for stirring the fires was during\r\nthe singing as “it drowned the noise.” What our local choir consisted of\r\nI do not remember, but I rather think it was simply vocal, and started\r\nby a “pitchpipe.” But at least there was nothing ridiculous about it. We\r\ndid not, as in a church at no great distance, have the violinist and his\r\ninstrument carried in on a man’s shoulders because the unfortunate\r\nmusician was without legs!\r\n\r\nThe sittings for the congregation were (I suppose as a matter of course\r\nin those days) all in closed pews with doors—the pews of a size, form,\r\nand respectability of appearance, likewise of comfort and fittings,\r\naccording to the social position of their holders. It could not,\r\nhowever, be said that the chief parishioners had the best places, for\r\nour two large, roomy, square seats were mounted up, side by side, a few\r\nsteps above the others at the end of the north aisle, with a good wall\r\nbetween us and the chancel, effectually preventing our seeing what was\r\ngoing on in that direction. Within our special pew, which had curtains\r\nmore or less drawn, we sat round with our feet at proper times on good\r\nhigh hassocks. When we knelt we all turned round and faced the sides of\r\nthe pew, and my juvenile sorrows were sometimes great towards the end of\r\nthe Litany. The fatigue from kneeling on the top of my unsteady perch\r\nproduced faintness, and I well remember my anxieties increasing with the\r\n“odd” feeling till I mustered courage to announce to my eldest sister,\r\nwhom I held in considerable awe, that I did not feel very well; and\r\nmeasures were taken accordingly. The pew was said to be just over where\r\nthe soldiers were buried who were killed during the Parliamentarian war\r\nat the Battle of Buttington, a locality in the same parish; but on an\r\noccasion of some repairs being made, the flooring was discovered to be\r\nlaid on, or close above the live rock, which rendered this view\r\ninaccurate. The surface of the ground was immediately below the floor,\r\nand as the family pew had on its east side one of the great east windows\r\nof the church, and on the north side a smaller one, both with small\r\npanes ill-leaded, and one with a very insufficiently fastened small\r\nwindow, our Sunday devotions in winter were anything but comfortable.\r\n\r\nI believe the rural congregation behaved with great propriety, though\r\ncertainly on one occasion it struck me that a reverence during the creed\r\nat the name of Pontius Pilate on the part of the wife of my father’s\r\nfarm-bailiff, was somewhat out of place. But we were free from such\r\nlapses in decency of arrangement as occurred elsewhere. The pigeons did\r\nnot roost in the tower, neither did a turkey sit on her eggs in the\r\npulpit, which, considering that the time of incubation for the turkey\r\nhen is four weeks, must have interfered considerably with the due\r\nperformance of service. Neither were we, so far as I remember,\r\nscandalised by attendance of dogs in church, whether avowedly\r\naccompanying their masters or making a voyage of discovery as to where\r\ntheir clerical owner might have vanished. And certainly we did not have\r\nthe disgraceful circumstance which occurred in another church with which\r\nI was acquainted, of two ladies of good social position in the parish\r\nwalking up to the rails of the communion table to receive the sacrament,\r\nfollowed by their great Newfoundland dog!\r\n\r\nOne practice—certainly objectionable, but perhaps not unusual in country\r\nparishes where the church was also used as the week-day schoolroom—was\r\nputting the bags holding the provisions which the children brought with\r\nthem for their dinners on the communion table. I do not think that this\r\nwas so very shocking, for no irreverence was intended. A table was a\r\ntable in those days, and not an “Altar,” and looking back on the matter\r\nit does not appear clear where else the food could have been safely\r\nplaced. I fancy there was no regular vestry and, excepting the floor, or\r\nthe seats of the pews, there does not seem to me to have been any other\r\nplace of moderately safe deposit. However, by and by a room was hired as\r\na schoolroom, and the church was freed from the presence of the children\r\nand their dinners. I well remember our going over in form to hold some\r\nsort of an examination, which was wound up by my father (who was\r\ncertainly better fitted to examine witnesses from the magistrate’s bench\r\nthan to probe for what information our little uncivilised urchins\r\npossessed) electrifying the audience by desiring to know whether his\r\nexaminee knew the use of a pocket-handkerchief. My mother was a more\r\nefficient aid by paying the schooling of all our own cottagers’\r\nchildren, and also in allaying strife. On one occasion, when a woman\r\nwished to remove her children from the parish school because they were\r\nbetter taught at a recently established Unitarian school, she\r\ndexterously overcame the difficulty by stating she meddled with nobody’s\r\nconscience, but if the children went to the parish school she paid, and\r\nif they did not go _she didn’t_. We heard no more on the subject.\r\n\r\nSome of our customs were very pretty. On Palm Sunday, that is the Sunday\r\nbefore Easter Sunday, sometimes known in our part and the district as\r\n“Flowering Sunday,” it was the custom to dress the graves with flowers.\r\nFriends of the family came from a long distance. A son of our\r\nhead-gardener would come down from Scotland for the occasion, and the\r\nwealth of yellow daffodils and white narcissus, which grew by the Wye,\r\nclose to the little church of Llancaut, helped greatly towards the\r\ndecoration. Two Crown Imperials were a greatly admired addition which,\r\nseason permitting, appeared to ornament one special grave. The\r\n“flowering” was a touching and pleasing remembrance of the friends whose\r\nbodies rested below, until in after years the custom gradually arose of\r\nplacing artificial flowers along with the fresh blossoms, and then\r\nfollowed the much to be deprecated practice of putting little cases of\r\nflowers of tinsel, or anything that was approved of, which might remain\r\non the grave. At Christmas time we had the real old-fashioned church\r\ndecorations of good large boughs of holly, with plenty of red berries,\r\nmistletoe, laurel, and anything evergreen of a solid sort. The squire\r\n(_i.e._, my father) contributed a cartload of evergreen branches, and as\r\na matter of course, they were applied largely to ornamenting our corner\r\npew with more regard to appearance than comfort.\r\n\r\nThe service was performed simply, as was customary in those days,\r\nwithout any music excepting the singing of the hymns, but as nothing was\r\nomitted, and there was, I believe, no curate, it must have been rather\r\nfatiguing to the vicar, and it certainly was a terribly long business\r\nespecially for those not always in good health, if they stayed for the\r\nCommunion Service on the rare occasions on which it was administered.\r\nThe drive from the Park to the bottom of the hill on which the Church\r\nstood, was upwards of two miles. Then came a wearying walk up the hill\r\nuntil this became so steep that in the Churchyard there were successive\r\nlittle arrangements of steps to help us up the ascent. Within, it seems\r\nto me, that the clergyman neither excused himself, nor us, anything that\r\nmight have lightened the strain, bodily and mental, to the younger\r\nattendants. The creed of St. Athanasius was duly gone through as well as\r\nthe Litany, and addresses, which nowadays are cut very short, came at\r\nfull length. When, after the return drive, we got safely home, I will\r\nnot say but that our spiritual state might have been better had our\r\nbodily condition been less open to the unsettling influence of a desire\r\nfor a much-needed meal.\r\n\r\nOne pleasure of the high days was having the fine old hymns for Easter\r\nor Christmas, which no bad singing can spoil, as a variety on Sternhold\r\nand Hopkins, but I still bear in mind the absolute depression caused by\r\nthat doleful production, the hymn called “The Lamentation of a Sinner.”\r\nTo this day it seems to me that it would be better for such a\r\ncomposition to be omitted from our service.\r\n\r\nAlthough it appears to be the correct thing for those who have been\r\nbefore the public in later life to have reminiscences (or for their\r\nbiographer to invent them), of their precocious piety, I cannot remember\r\nthat I was ever much given that way. I think that I was as a child kept\r\nin steady paths of proper behaviour, and amongst the items taught was\r\ncertainly scrupulous observance of the fifth commandment in all its\r\nbranches. Any deviation from truth was another point, the wickedness of\r\nwhich was most sedulously inculcated; and I should say that from my\r\nearliest days I was thoroughly well grounded in as much simple and\r\nnecessary religious information as my small head could carry.\r\n\r\nBut I did not indulge in fine sentiments, felt or expressed, and I think\r\nthat my first absolute feeling on religious matters was roused when in\r\none of our spring visits to London, I went regularly on Sunday morning\r\nwith the family to attend the service at the Vere Street Chapel, where\r\nMr. Scobell was then vicar, and some clergyman of high standing\r\noccasionally preached. One thing that was very charming to a girl who\r\nhad not heard anything of the kind before, was the hymn singing. The\r\nsplendid hymn “Thou art the way,” imprinted itself on my mind, as\r\nlikewise a part of a sermon by Mr. Scobell, on the basis of our trust in\r\nGod. He enumerated various of the high characteristics of the Deity; His\r\nboundless power, His holiness and other characteristics of His majesty.\r\nWith the mention of each characteristic he put the question, “Does this\r\ngive you a claim for acceptance?” until he came to the climax, “His\r\nlove,” with the words “_but His love, that_ you may trust.” Perhaps if\r\nthe good man had known how these words would abide to old age as a\r\ncomfort to one who was then amongst the youngest of his congregation, it\r\nwould have given him pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Dublin, the celebrated Dr. Whately, also preached at\r\nthis Chapel, and I heard him deliver his grand sermon on “the doubts\r\nleading to the assured belief of St. Thomas.” I suppose this time was\r\nwhat in some circles would have been called my “awakening,” but we in\r\nour family neither thought nor spoke of these things; and any allusion\r\nto such matters would have brought on me (possibly very rightly) an\r\nawakening of another kind, which would have entirely disinclined me to\r\nfavour the family with any religious views, beyond what might be shown\r\nin behaving with propriety and above all doing as I was bid to the best\r\nof my ability.\r\n\r\nReverting to early recollections of ecclesiastical matters, or things in\r\nwhich the clergy might have been expected, _ex-officio_, to interfere,\r\nthere certainly was room for improvement, but this was not peculiar to\r\nthe olden time. Some of the curious circumstances of which accounts\r\nreached my young ears are better forgotten. One thing that I remember\r\nwas the very different position relating to sporting, and also to the\r\ndivergence in dress from the great precision now in vogue. A clergyman\r\nof somewhat high position, being, I suppose, pressed for time on one\r\noccasion, performed the funeral service in his “pink” visible beneath\r\nhis surplice. Another, subsequently a favourite with all his poorer\r\nparishioners for his kindness, when a candidate for orders, was\r\nencouraged by his father to the necessary mental labour by the promise\r\nthat if he passed his examination he should have a double-barrelled gun!\r\nIn a locality not far from the edge of Monmouthshire, I myself saw the\r\nincumbent of one of the small livings with his coat off loading a manure\r\ncart! He comes back to my memory as doing the work quietly and gravely,\r\nand with no more appearance of derogation than if he had been budding\r\nthe roses in his garden; still the work must have taken a considerable\r\namount of time from the purposes of his ordination.\r\n\r\nThe “Oxford” or “Tractarian Movement” of 1833-45[15] made an enormous\r\ncommotion, and perhaps for a retired locality nowhere more than in our\r\nown parish.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the old vicar, amongst a succession of clergy the\r\nmost noted was Dr. Armstrong (presented 1846).[16] With him came the\r\nfull tide of the Oxford Movement, and as he was a highly accomplished\r\nman, eloquent in the pulpit, of charming society manner in the\r\ndrawing-room, and with his heart fixed on driving his own views of\r\nreform and restoration forward, the holders of differing ecclesiastical\r\nviews in the parish were soon very thoroughly by the ears. My father as\r\n“squire” and chief resident landowner had always tried (much to his own\r\ndiscomfort at times) to uphold the cause of decency and order. But with\r\nthe new arrangements came all sorts of trouble from an excess of\r\nceremonial, and peace seemed to have vanished. The attempted setting up\r\nof confession caused much trouble, and difference of lay and clerical\r\nopinion in the restoration of the Church was a fertile cause of\r\nill-feeling. One special point was the right claimed by the vicar to\r\nprevent any of the general congregation entering the church by the\r\nchancel door. We had always gone in that way, and it was not convenient\r\nto reach the family pew by going round two sides of the church, so my\r\nfather stuck to his legal rights, and the door was not visibly fastened.\r\nBut one unlucky day when we, the ladies of the family, arrived as usual\r\nand tried to go in, to our consternation it appeared impossible to turn\r\nthe latch. It was a remarkably pretty handle—I suppose an imitation of\r\nmediæval ironwork—but it required more than common woman’s strength to\r\nmake this unlucky invention act in admitting us to the church. However,\r\nwe were not to be kept out by this ingenious device. Muscularly I was\r\nremarkably strong from working in wood and stone, and I was perfectly\r\nhappy to forward my father’s wishes, so thenceforward for many a week I\r\nwent to church with a round ruler in my pocket, and slipping this into\r\nthe hanging bit of ironwork, I easily raised the latch and gave my\r\nmother and sisters entrance to church. I did not object to my part of\r\nthe ceremony in the least—rather liked it, in fact—but looking back from\r\ngraver age it seems to me that it would have been better if the vicar\r\nhad not driven the squire to defend the rights of the congregation by\r\nsuch forcible measures. After a while the latch (or the vicar’s view on\r\nthe subject) was loosened, and we obtained entrance without, like the\r\nviolent, being obliged to take it by force.\r\n\r\nThe real troubles of the times were endless. It was even possible for a\r\nsincerely religious man to absent himself from the reception of\r\ncommunion on the ground that he was not able to participate with\r\nChristian comfort and in a charitable frame of mind. Within the church\r\nbuilding itself the condition of things was not satisfactory. The\r\nopenings beneath the very “open” seats, whereby was secured free\r\ncirculation for dogs and draughts, were unpleasant in various ways.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of our skilled and accomplished vicar, Dr. Armstrong, to\r\nthe Bishopric of Grahamstown in South Africa, for which he was eminently\r\nfitted, was hailed by many of us with heartfelt gratitude. In later\r\nyears, under the kindly care of the Rev. Percy Burd (successor in 1862\r\nof the Rev. Alan Cowburn) who, without thinking it necessary to push\r\neverything to extremities, attended with the utmost care to proprieties\r\nof detail of worship in church, to social friendliness, and to care of\r\nthe poor, we passed along in paths of comfort and peace, for which some\r\nof us were deeply grateful.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmongst various parish or local matters, of which the bodily presence\r\nhas, to a great degree, passed away, and the remembrance that at one\r\ntime such things were has probably faded from most of the minds in which\r\nthey ever held a place, are turnpike gates, with their adjoining\r\ntoll-houses; also the parish stocks and the parish pound.\r\n\r\nIn parochial arrangements in my day two great improvements arose, one of\r\nwhich has now long been a regular part of parish work, but was new at\r\nleast to us. This was a women’s clothing club. The other was the\r\ncommencement of the plan of lending books to those who otherwise would\r\nrarely have seen them. It was introduced by my sister, Georgiana E.\r\nOrmerod, when little more than a girl, quite at her own expense. It was\r\ncontinued by her without any pecuniary assistance (unless may be\r\nsometimes some small co-operation from myself) to the end of her long\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe clothing club was set on foot under some difficulties by the wife of\r\none of the clergy resident in our parish, for the goods procurable at\r\nChepstow, the nearest town, were by no means remarkable for their\r\nquality, and Mrs. Morgan thought herself bound to do the best in her\r\npower for her poor subscribers. So the matter was accommodated (not\r\nwithout a good deal of grumbling from Chepstow shopkeepers about money\r\nbeing taken out of their pockets) by part of the goods brought from\r\nBristol (where excellent material was to be had) for the women to choose\r\nfrom, being sent previous to “club day” to Mr. Morgan’s large and\r\ncommodious house. In those days, so far as I know, the plan of sending\r\nthe women with tickets to the shops had not been adopted, and our\r\nmethod, though exceedingly laborious to the lady manager of the club,\r\nwas good for the women, for it ensured that their choice was confined to\r\nthe very best materials, all of a useful kind, and at the lowest\r\npossible prices.\r\n\r\nWhen a growing up girl, perhaps about sixteen, my sister Georgiana\r\nthought it would be a pleasure to the children of our own cottagers to\r\nhave some entertaining books, and she began by lending them from the\r\nsmall store which had gradually come down from the elders of our\r\ngeneration. She chose carefully what she thought would be of interest,\r\nand very soon the elder children took to reading, or sometimes the\r\nfathers would read aloud to their families. My sister always either read\r\nthe books herself or knew the nature of the contents before lending\r\nthem, and when done with they were brought back and exchanged. The\r\nborrowing rapidly spread beyond our own cottagers till it included our\r\nfarmers and their friends at Gloucester and Bristol. The books were\r\nalmost invariably treated with all reasonable care, and scarcely ever\r\nwas one a-missing. Besides the entertainment, they acted as an antidote\r\nto the attractions of the public-house. It was a great delight to my\r\nsister when she had a request for a book, because Jack or Dick was home\r\nfrom his ship or on a holiday, and they wanted a book that would keep\r\nhim from the “public.” I attribute much of my sister’s success to the\r\ncare with which, even after her book-lending had extended to far-distant\r\nlocalities, she chose the books. On one occasion when she had made a\r\ndonation of books of her own choosing to the Lending Library, Bethnal\r\nGreen, London, she was greatly pleased to hear that the boys and girls\r\nhad passed the word round amongst the factories of the entertaining\r\nbooks that had arrived. Those we found suited best (for I was in some\r\ndegree her assistant) were accounts of real incidents made into\r\nnarratives. Ballantyne’s earlier books with accounts of the fire\r\nbrigade, post office, lighthouse and the like were great favourites,\r\nperhaps none the less for the conversations being at times a trifle\r\nvulgar; but when a writer took up some special view, as of teetotalism,\r\nhigh-churchism, or any other specialism, we dropped him. Stories of\r\nolden times, such as the Plague in London, or the Great Fire; risings in\r\nHenry the Eighth’s time; wars of the time of Charles the First and\r\nCromwell; forest troubles of the time of William Rufus, and the\r\nlike—told as stories, with the facts correct although the thread on\r\nwhich they were strung was imaginary—were always favourites. We seldom\r\nlent absolutely religious books unless they were asked for, and then we\r\ntook care that they should be of a solid and interesting sort; but\r\nwhether sacred or secular the number of books lent or given for lending\r\nin the course of the year was very great.\r\n\r\nMy sister was a highly accomplished woman, a good linguist and\r\nhistorian, and a careful scriptural student. As a scientific\r\nentomologist and a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London, she\r\nwas a co-operator with me in my work. She devoted her artistic talent\r\nfor many years to the execution of excellent diagrams, serviceable for\r\nagricultural purposes, of insects injurious to farm and orchard produce,\r\nsome of which she made over to the Royal Agricultural Society, but the\r\ngreater number she presented to friends interested in lessening the\r\namount of loss through insect injury, and to Agricultural Colleges. From\r\ngirlhood to old age she unceasingly carried on her chosen work of\r\ndistribution of useful healthy literature. She asked no aid, nor made\r\nthe considerable sums she expended, and the careful cordial thought she\r\ngave to this work, matter of public notoriety, but in her last moments\r\nit brought a smile to her face when I told her that I purposed to\r\ncontinue her work.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy father when living near Chester had the first news on a Sunday\r\nmorning before church time, of the Duke of Wellington’s success, and\r\nthat the battle of Waterloo had been fought and won. After service he\r\nmounted on a tombstone and announced the glorious news to the assembled\r\ncongregation. In my early days in Gloucestershire, a neighbour, Captain\r\nFenton, was at times thought to be tedious in his recurrence to the\r\ncharge of the Scots Greys in which he had served, but it was a grand\r\nmemory all the same.\r\n\r\nIn a much humbler sphere and at a different stage of the same great\r\nstruggle an interesting part was played by a very decent\r\nwoman—afterwards a servant in our family—at the burial of Sir John Moore\r\nat Corunna. She was proud to remember that she was one of those who held\r\na lanthorn at the ceremony alluded to in Wolfe’s poem:—\r\n\r\n                “We buried him darkly at dead of night\r\n                     *     *     *      *     *     *\r\n                 By the struggling moonbeams’ misty light\r\n                 And the lanthorn dimly burning.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE IX.\r\n  MAP OF THE BANKS OF THE WYE.\r\n  SEDBURY PARK PROPERTY, THE DARKLY SHADED AREA BETWEEN\r\n  SEVERN AND WYE.\r\n  (_pp. 33 and 38._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                             SEVERN AND WYE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe locality round which most of the recollections of nearly half my\r\nlife centre is in the district of Gloucestershire, between the Severn\r\nand the Wye (opposite Chepstow in Monmouthshire, plate IX.), almost at\r\nthe extremity of the peninsula, sometimes not inaptly called the “Forest\r\nPeninsula,” as some of the “Hundreds” comprised in the more widely\r\nextended area stretching on to the Forest of Dean near Newnham, are\r\ntechnically called the “Forest Hundreds,” although what is commonly\r\nthought of (at the present day) as the Forest of Dean, has long since\r\nceased to be connected, popularly speaking, with the lower extremity of\r\nthe peninsula. This is bounded on the two sides by the Severn and the\r\nWye respectively; and at intervals it presents to the Wye considerable\r\nfrontage of high cliffs of mountain limestone, and to the Severn red\r\nmarl, capped more or less with lias. It terminates at the junction of\r\nthe two rivers in a small area, which is an island at high water, but\r\naccessibly connected with the mainland at low water. Here, that is on\r\nthe rocky ground at the point of confluence of the Wye with the Severn,\r\nwere still existing in my time (that is up to 1873) the few but massive\r\nremains of the Hermitage and Chapels, popularly known collectively as\r\nthe Chapel of St. Tecla or Treacle Island (plate X.). The name as given\r\nby William of Worcester in full form is “_Capella Sancti Teriaci\r\nAnachoretæ_.” He describes the locality likewise as “The Rok Seynt\r\nTryacle,” but not having now the opportunity of consulting his\r\nobservations, I am not able to say whether the ancient chronicler gives\r\nany reason for the building of this little but massive knot of\r\nbuildings, or for its overthrow, which must have been a somewhat\r\nlaborious task, and from the thickness and the solidly built nature of\r\nthe walls, one that required co-operation. In the short account given by\r\nmy father in “Strigulensia” from which I borrow some part of these\r\nnotes, he says, “It would be vain to attempt identification of the\r\nHermit whose name is associated with the ruins, and who does not appear\r\nin the calendar of saints, but he occurs as follows in the “Valor\r\nEcclesiasticus” of Hen. VIII., vol. ii. p. 501,” “Capella Sancti Triaci\r\nvalet nihil, quâ stat in mare et nulla proficua inde proveniunt.”\r\nWhether modern skilled archæologists may have thrown light on the early\r\nhistory of the anchorite and his Severn and seaweed-girt chapel I do not\r\nknow, but few places could be found less attractive for the\r\narchæeological picnic-excursions which have become fashionable of late\r\nyears. Even to my brothers and myself, accustomed as we were to Severn\r\nmud, and to picking our way fairly safely over and amongst the coarse\r\nbrown slippery seaweed fronds (chiefly, if I remember rightly, the\r\n_Fucus serratus_), the passage over such parts as were not then\r\nsubmerged was an exceedingly muddy progress, needing a deal of care lest\r\nwe should take a sudden slide into one of the little rock basins\r\nconcealed by the “kelp” or other coarse brown seaweed. But once arrived,\r\nit was very pleasant to sit in the sunshine and enjoy the glorious view\r\ndown the Estuary of the Severn, the fresh salt air blowing round us, or\r\notherwise employ ourselves to our fancy. From careful measurements we\r\nfound the length of the chapel to have been 31 feet 6 inches, the width\r\n14 feet 6 inches, and the thickness of the walls, wherever sufficient\r\nremained for observation, approximately 3 feet.[17] We had to be quick\r\nin our operations and our return had to be kept in mind, or we should\r\nhave had to be fetched off in a boat, and under all circumstances it was\r\nprobably best for the sake of appearances that our walk home should be\r\nas far as possible by the fields or under the cliffs where minutiæ as to\r\ncondition of boots, &c., were unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the scenery of each of the rivers are wholly\r\ndifferent. The Severn above Beachley and Aust (in former days the\r\nland-points of the much-used “Old Passage”) spreads into a wide area of\r\nwater, perhaps about a mile wide at the narrowest, and at high tide\r\nforming a noble lake-like expanse. The Wye, on the contrary, as shown in\r\nthe map (plate IX.), takes its sinuous and narrow course between\r\nsuccessive promontories, projecting alternately from the Gloucestershire\r\nand Monmouthshire banks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RUINED ANCHORITE’S CHAPEL OF ST. TECLA, ON THE CHAPEL ROCK\r\n  WHERE SEVERN AND WYE MEET.\r\n  _From a sketch by Miss E.A. Ormerod._\r\n  (p. 33.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SEVERN CLIFFS, SEDBURY PARK.\r\n  (p. 40.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAcross some considerable portion of the river a quarter of a mile or so\r\nabove Beachley, on the Gloucestershire side, a rocky ledge of limestone\r\ncalled “The Lyde” projects at low tide, causing a backwater of which the\r\nsteady roar can be heard at a long distance.[18] Cormorants on the rock,\r\nand conger-eels below it, were regular inhabitants or visitors—the\r\nformer presumably attracted by the latter, which served to some degree\r\nalso as food to the fishermen, although pronounced to be\r\n“slobbery-like.”\r\n\r\nThe muddy colour of the Severn was not in itself picturesque—at least I\r\nhave never heard the point mentioned with admiration; but to me, born as\r\nI was by this noblest of our rivers, it seemed to convey a comfortable\r\nidea of homeliness and strength. Sometimes, however, in the early\r\nmorning or in certain conditions of light, the deep rosy colouring was\r\nalmost as if the whole width of water had been changed to blood; then\r\nthe effect was very splendid, and as wonderful still as it must have\r\nbeen in days long gone by to Queen Boadicea:—\r\n\r\n             “Still rolls thy crimson flood in glory on\r\n                As when of old its deep ensanguined dye\r\n              Told to the warrior Queen her falling throne,\r\n                Her people’s death, the foemen’s victory.”\r\n\r\nBut, independently of other considerations, a bend in the river was of\r\ngreat local service. It formed a bay of about perhaps three-quarters of\r\na mile across, bounded to the west by our own and the Beachley cliffs,\r\nand further protected, or endangered, on the southern side by a low\r\nrange of rocks running out into the river. With the rising tide the\r\nimport shipping to Gloucester, which in those days was extensive, put in\r\nhere to be searched by the Custom House officials. At that time\r\n(excepting tugs) it was entirely composed of sailing vessels mostly\r\nladen with corn, wine, and timber, and the mixed fleet moving about in\r\nthe bay with colours flying was a very lively sight. In due time they\r\npassed on—the three-masters, ships, and barques, or the graceful\r\nchasse-marées, taking the lead; brigs and schooners following, and\r\nsloops and—if weather permitted—Severn trows bringing up the rear.\r\nThese, however, as they differed very little in formation from canal\r\nbarges, required tolerably fair or at least quiet weather to allow them\r\nto proceed in safety. The procession of shipping came along almost\r\nbeneath our cliffs, the deep channel being on that side, and perhaps it\r\nwas as well that they were no nearer, or the nautical remarks might have\r\nbeen more often audible to the young people than was desirable!\r\n\r\nA special convenience to ourselves was a little creek under the cliffs,\r\ncalled in those parts a “pill” (presumably from the Welsh pwll or pool),\r\nwhich allowed of coals being run in a sloop across from Bristol and\r\ncarted up to the house by a shorter road than that from Chepstow.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. (A).—PUTCHER FOR CATCHING SALMON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSalmon fishing was carried on partly by nets from fishing boats, partly\r\nby rows of baskets known as “putts” or “putchers.” The boats during the\r\nboat fishing lay above the edge of the water on the sloping and slippery\r\nfrontage of the shore. When the tide served for fishing, the men went\r\ndown from the village above the cliffs to their boats across the flat\r\nand precipitously-edged grass, between the base of the low cliffs and\r\nthe sloping shore. Each man wriggled with might and main at his boat\r\ntill he loosened its adhesion to the tenacious mud and started it on its\r\nslide with its bows foremost towards the water. Once off, of course the\r\npace accelerated; its owner, running behind, held on and clambered in as\r\nbest he could, and the two arrived safely and with a great jolt on the\r\nwater. The boats then formed in line, secured by being tied stern to\r\nstern at about a boat’s length from each other, and presumably anchored\r\nalso, but this I do not remember. The net of each boat was lowered, and\r\nnothing further occurred till a fish was captured; then the net was\r\nlifted, the fish, shining in all the beauty of its silvery scales, taken\r\nout, and the net lowered again. These were the best fish; those that\r\nwere caught in the putts were “drowned” fish, and unless the fishermen\r\nwere fairly on the alert to secure them before the falling tide had left\r\nthe baskets long uncovered, there was a very good chance of the eyes\r\nbeing pecked out or the fish otherwise disfigured by birds.\r\n\r\nThe putcher or basket fishing was carried on by means of very open\r\nextinguisher-shaped baskets each long enough to hold, it can hardly be\r\nsaid accommodate, a good-sized salmon. The frame or stand on which these\r\nbaskets were fixed was formed of two rows of strong poles or upright\r\npieces of wood, running down the shore, across the narrow of the river,\r\nfor many yards, firmly fixed between high and low tide level, at such a\r\ndistance as would allow the baskets to reach from one side to the other.\r\nHorizontal poles or pieces of wood connected the upright poles, and to\r\nthese horizontal supports the baskets were attached, so as to form rows\r\nwith the open ends of the extinguishers facing up stream and all ranged\r\none storey above the other. The fish were drifted into the basket trap,\r\nand of course, though they might injure themselves in their struggles,\r\nand to some degree their market value, they were powerless to effect\r\ntheir escape and withdraw backward against the set of the tide.[19]\r\n\r\nThe much larger form of basket described by Mr. Buckland as “putts,” and\r\nas being used for catching flat fish, was of a slightly different\r\nmake—formed only of two instead of three pieces; one large piece, so\r\nwide at the opening that I, as a girl, had no difficulty in standing\r\nwithin it, and a very much smaller piece, forming a kind of nose. This\r\nlittle adjunct was, I believe, taken off and searched by the fishermen\r\nfor what it contained. To my sister Georgiana and myself it was a great\r\npleasure to go down to where the two great eel-putts stood on clean\r\nshore at very low tide below the longest row of salmon-putchers, and\r\nsearch for anything that was to be found. My sister was a good\r\nconchologist. We searched for seaweed, &c., &c., and thereby got a deal\r\nof pleasant amusement. The fishermen, who knew us well, made no\r\nobjection to our investigations, though, as one of the men remarked on\r\none occasion, “It was not everybody they liked to see near the putts.”\r\n\r\nIn our immediate neighbourhood the fishermen were quiet—at least I never\r\nheard of their getting into very objectionable difficulties—but about\r\neight miles higher up the river, near Lydney, things in this respect\r\nwere by no means all that could be wished. On one occasion they captured\r\nthe Fishery Inspector himself—whose duty it was to ascertain that the\r\nmeshes were not below a certain measurement—and secured him in the nets.\r\nAnother time somebody (who, unluckily for him, bore some resemblance to\r\nthe obnoxious inspector) got nearly sloughed up in one of the great\r\nmarsh ditches, and would have been left to live or die as might\r\nchance—probably the latter—but for the arrival of timely help. My father\r\nbeing one of the acting magistrates of the district, we used to hear\r\nfrom time to time of these and other “mauvaises plaisanteries” in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Forest of Dean.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn reference to the portion of the Ordnance Map (plate IX.) it will be\r\nseen that there is a broad band marked “mud,” of about a sixth of a mile\r\nin width at the widest part and extending for about a mile and a half by\r\nthe side of the deep channel of the Severn, between it and the cliffs of\r\nthe Beachley and Sedbury Bay.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable capture of which I have any recollection as taking\r\nplace in the waters, or rather in the mud of the Severn, was said to be\r\na “Bottle-nosed whale,” or Dolphin, _Delphinus tursio_, Fabr., but it\r\nwas so many decades of years ago, that I have no means now of turning to\r\nany record for verification of the species. The capture itself excited a\r\ndeal of local interest. It was on a summer morning that one of my\r\nbrothers, enlivening his vacation studies, as was his custom, by\r\nwatching through his telescope anything of interest that might be going\r\non amongst the shipping or elsewhere, saw something like an enormous\r\nfish struggling and “flopping” on the Beachley pier of the old Passage\r\nFerry. As a matter of course, we young folks set off after luncheon to\r\nhave our share of the sight, and found the creature had been captured\r\nwhen lying helpless, or half dead, in the mud at the Aust side of the\r\nFerry, and had been towed across behind a boat. At this distance of time\r\nI only remember the whale- or dolphin-like shape of the animal, its\r\ngreat size, and that it was apparently of a greyish colour; but this\r\nitem might very likely be from its being coated with Severn mud. In\r\nBell’s “British Quadrupeds” the greatest length recorded of various\r\nspecimens found in England is 12 feet. The colour of the back is black,\r\nwith a purplish tinge, becoming dusky on the sides, and dirty white on\r\nthe belly. This species is considered rare in England and it is of some\r\ninterest, in referring to the locality of what may be called our own\r\ncapture, that “The first account which we have of its appearance on our\r\nown shores is that of John Hunter,” and it was taken with its young one\r\n“on the sea coast near Berkeley”; that is about two or three miles\r\nhigher up the left bank of the Severn than the Aust Cliffs. Another\r\nspecimen was found in the river Dart in Devonshire, and, it was stated,\r\n“was killed with difficulty, the poor animal having suffered for four\r\nhours the attacks of eight men armed with spears and two guns, and\r\nassisted by dogs. When wounded it made a noise like the bellowing of a\r\nbull.”[20] In the case of the Old Passage specimen the poor creature was\r\nalso most barbarously treated, chiefly by being attacked by the running\r\nof hay forks, pitch forks, and the like, into its body, and I remember a\r\ngood deal of chopping with hatchets or axes, but it was quite quiet and,\r\nit was to be hoped, was past feeling pain. Immense popular interest, of\r\ncourse, was excited as to the precise nature of the unusual “take,” as\r\nto whether it was a Leviathan, or possibly the kind of fish that\r\nswallowed Jonah—but the affair ended by the creature being shipped off\r\nto Bristol to be turned into a little money for the boatmen who secured\r\nit, and no other cetacean was taken during the remainder of the years in\r\nwhich Sedbury was my home.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most observable of the seaweeds, which grew on the rocks or large\r\nstones, more or less in the muddy salt water between tide levels at the\r\nmouth of the Severn, were of the genus _Fucus_, which at one time was\r\nmuch used in the making of kelp. The ornamental kinds always appeared to\r\nme to be unaccountably absent. They were not to be expected to make this\r\nplace their habitat, but, still, their almost total absence in the\r\nmasses of drift matter left by the retiring tide struck me as curious.\r\nIn my most successful searches I do not remember ever being fortunate\r\nenough to secure even a fragment of the lovely Oak-leaf, _Delesseria_,\r\nwith its bright, rosy-veined leaves from as much as 4 inches to 8 inches\r\nin length placed along their cylindrical stem, or the Peacock seaweed,\r\n_Padina pavonea_, with its concentric markings. Of Iceland Moss there\r\nmight be a battered morsel. The general composition of the driftage was\r\ncomposed of little except what might be grown in the neighbourhood,\r\nmixed with sugar cane or packing material thrown from the vessels. This,\r\nhowever, seemed to me of some interest in connection with the set of the\r\ncurrents. Here, however, I am out of my element, but as my brother Dr.\r\nOrmerod employed me as a collector, I am not personally responsible.\r\n\r\nThe distinct varieties of soil, and also the geographical and the\r\ngeological surroundings of Sedbury, were unusually favourable to natural\r\nhistory investigations, whether of fauna and flora of the present day,\r\nor of fossil remains of saurians and shells. These were easily\r\naccessible as they fell from the frontage of lias, or the narrow\r\nhorizontal strip in the cliffs (plate IX.) facing the Severn, well known\r\nto the geologists as the “bone bed.” At the highest part the cliffs were\r\nabout 140 feet, calculating from medium tide level. There the face had\r\nbeen quarried back for a supply of lias limestone, used in enlarging the\r\noffices of the house, and in so doing had laid bare a fine bed of\r\nso-called “Venus” shells. We used to find beautiful specimens of those\r\nshells, irrespective of this extra fine deposit, and also of “patens,”\r\noysters of some kind, which we sought for unweariedly, hammer in hand.\r\nThe greatest matters of interest, however, were the saurian, or the fish\r\nremains, of which we sometimes found a plentiful supply of specimens of\r\nlittle value, and now and then some of considerable interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XI.\r\n  ROMAN POTTERY, FOUND IN SEDBURY PARK.\r\n  _From a drawing by Miss E. A. Ormerod._\r\n  (_p. 18._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAURIAN FROM THE LIAS, SEDBURY CLIFFS.\r\n  (_p. 41._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Sedbury cliffs lie nearly north of the Aust cliff, and contain the\r\nAust bone bed, from which the Severn, about a mile wide, or somewhat\r\nmore, there divides them. Geologically, in all important\r\ncharacteristics, I believe the two cliffs correspond. Of this bone bed\r\nit is noted by Sir Charles Lyell[21]: “In England the Lias is succeeded\r\nby conformable strata of red and green marl or clay. There intervenes,\r\nhowever, both in the neighbourhood of Exmouth, in Devonshire, and in the\r\ncliffs of Westbury and Aust, in Gloucestershire, on the banks of the\r\nSevern, a dark-coloured stratum, well known by the name of the ‘bone\r\nbed.’ It abounds in the remains of saurians and fish, and was formerly\r\nclassed as the lowest bed of Lias; but Sir P. Egerton has shown that it\r\nshould be referred to as the Upper New Red Sandstone.” The reasons given\r\nare not of interest to the general reader. From the fallen _débris_ of\r\nthis we collected vertebræ, single, or sometimes a few in connection,\r\nalso bones of the paddles, and any amount of teeth, also coprolites, the\r\nexcrementitious matter of the living owners of the bones. These were in\r\ngreat quantity, but I never remember that they were other than irregular\r\nlumps, and though some of us were much given to grinding and polishing\r\nstones that afforded hope of an ornamental result, it never occurred to\r\nus to exercise our talents on these lumps, which might have indicated in\r\ntheir undigested contents some evidence of the diet of their consumers.\r\n\r\nThe only valuable or interesting specimen of Saurian remains (that is of\r\nan animal in moderate degree of entirety) fell from the cliffs after I\r\nhad ceased to reside there. This was a slab of Lias about 3 feet long by\r\n2 feet broad, and about 7 to 9 inches thick (plate XI.) The history of\r\nits fall, as given to me in a letter from Dr. John Yeats, F.R.G.S., then\r\nresiding at Chepstow, dated September, 1882, was, that “From one of the\r\nledges, or from the top of a slip or subsidence, a fir tree was blown\r\ndown during the autumn of 1882.... The fossil was found beneath the\r\nroots,” and “the fossil remains were laid bare by a conchoidal\r\nfracture.” A few detached vertebræ were collected, but unfortunately no\r\npart of the head was secured. Of this specimen Professor Richard Owen\r\nwas good enough to report to Dr. Yeats on the 24th of May, 1883, as\r\nfollows: “From the concavity of the articular surfaces of the vertebræ,\r\nI infer it to be part of an ichthyosaurus, and the number and character\r\nof the ribs agree with that deduction. If any part of the jaws or teeth\r\nshould be found near the locality it would decide the matter.”\r\n\r\nThis fossil is now in the possession of Sir William H. Marling, at\r\nSedbury.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the cliffs was of a very mixed nature, with ledges of\r\nstone projecting slightly in places, and from the effect of weathering,\r\nlandslips, leading at times to inconvenience, were not infrequent. As we\r\nknew the nature of the ground we were careful about going near the edge\r\nof the top of the cliff, where a precipice or a crack showed danger, but\r\nit happened more than once that a bullock or calf, attracted by food to\r\nbe found amongst the trees or bushes which in some places clothed the\r\nslanting upper part, was tempted beyond safe footing, and toppled down\r\nto the bottom to its own destruction. On one occasion, on returning from\r\na walk, my sister Georgiana and I, not having noticed a fall from the\r\ncliffs, were cut off by one of these slips from any comfortable advance.\r\nIt was not a case of danger, but a choice between much wet and dirt from\r\nSevern mud, or very considerable discomfort of another sort, as the slip\r\nhad brought down with it brambles, &c., &c., most unpleasant to brave\r\nfor the sake of dryness. We preferred the wet passage, feeling our way\r\nwith our feet through the muddy water from one good-sized stone to\r\nanother, and presently arrived safely above the high-tide level, but to\r\nthose who did not know that beneath the muddy surface there was a sound\r\nfooting if sought for, the little episode might have been unpleasant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XII.\r\n  ROYAL MAIL STARTING FROM OLD GENERAL POST OFFICE, LONDON.\r\n  _Original lent by Arthur Ackermann & Son, 191, Regent Street, W._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                TRAVELLING BY COACH, FERRY, AND RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my early days much of the passenger transit of South Wales and the\r\nsouth-westerly part of England passed over the old Passage Ferry across\r\nthe Severn from Beachley to Aust, and consequently the coaches all\r\npassed our park gates. It was said there were fourteen coaches a day. On\r\nthis I am unable to offer an opinion, but there were a great number, and\r\namongst them were two mails. The road to the head of the old Passage\r\nPier, from Chepstow, was about three and a half miles in length, and\r\nvery hilly (going up one ascent, long or short as the case might be, to\r\ngo down another), with the exception of two lengths of flat “galloping\r\nground.” These well deserved their name, and I can still remember the\r\nswing of violent speed at which the high, piled-up vehicle tore past us,\r\ncausing children and accompanying dogs to allow it a very free passage.\r\nThe journey was not without risk of disaster, for on one occasion in\r\nturning a sharp angle, on the incline of a steep shore-hill, without due\r\ncare, the coach lurched to the outward side of the curve and made a\r\ndistribution of its outside passengers on the greensward by our park\r\ngates. It certainly would have been a great help in those days if the\r\nwish (though not exactly as he expressed it) of the driver of one of the\r\nmore old-fashioned of the coaches could have been carried out, and “a\r\nlittle akyduct” made to convey the road from the top of one hill to the\r\nnext, thus avoiding the dangerous descent.\r\n\r\nThe view from the tops of the coaches as they galloped along the flat\r\nroad at the summit of the Severn cliffs down to the Ferry pier was very\r\nbeautiful. On one side was the Severn, a mile wide at the narrowest,\r\nwith the red Aust cliffs opposite, the Sedbury cliffs above; and, in the\r\ndistance, about thirty miles away up the river, the hills, near or\r\nbeyond Gloucester, could be faintly seen. On the other side, about a\r\nfield or two from the road, was the lowest part of the Wye at its point\r\nof juncture with the Severn, and the noble estuary itself opening out\r\nfrom about four miles width till it was lost to view in the distance of\r\nthe Severn Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TIME-TABLE ILLUSTRATING THE METHOD OF TRAVELLING 200 YEARS AGO.\r\n]\r\n\r\n    YORK Four Days\r\n    Stage-Coach.\r\n    Begins on Friday the 12th of April 1706.\r\n    ALL that are desirous to pass from London to York\r\n    or from York to London, or any other Place\r\n    on that Road; Let them Repair to the Black Swan in\r\n    Holbourn in London, and to the Black Swan in Coney\r\n    Street in York.\r\n    At both which Places, they may be received in a\r\n    Stage Coach every Monday, Wednesday and Friday,\r\n    which performs the whole Journey in Four Days, (if\r\n    God permits.)

On one\r\noccasion, while fourteen passengers were crossing in a sailing boat,\r\nevery living thing, except one dog, perished in mid-transit. It was on a\r\nstormy Sunday in September, 1838, and the boat was heavily laden with\r\nhorses as well as the passengers. How the accident happened was never\r\nknown. One of my brothers had been watching the boat from our cliffs,\r\nand on looking again, after a minute or so, she was gone. The\r\nconjectural cause of the disaster was that one of the horses had become\r\nunruly. The assignment of the disaster to a judgment for travelling on\r\nSunday, may be looked on as a state of feeling very desirable to be\r\nremoved by changing times, which have brought a larger charitableness\r\nand greater common sense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIII.\r\n  OLD CHEPSTOW BRIDGE, REBUILT IN 1816, WITH POST-CHAISE CROSSING IT.\r\n  _From an old picture signed W. Williams, 1783._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA novel custom was associated with the Old Passage. A man suspected of\r\npossible infection of hydrophobia, was put into the salt water, and\r\ntowed about in the Severn at the stern of a boat. In the event of a man\r\nhaving been bitten by a stray dog, this operation made his village\r\nacquaintances much easier in their minds about him. They had also the\r\nfun, and in any case the patient would not be the worse for a thorough\r\ngood washing!\r\n\r\nThe appliances of the ferry were a steam boat and various sailing boats,\r\nincluding one known as the Mail-boat, as well as on the Beachley side,\r\nan apparatus acting as a telegraph. This consisted of an arrangement of\r\nboard which, when at rest, resembled a wooden window shutter about a\r\ncouple of yards square, fastened to one of the buildings; and, by some\r\ncode of signals of an exceedingly simple sort, requisite directions were\r\nconveyed across the river as to the boat service.\r\n\r\nOn our side there was one solidly built pier, serviceable for shipment\r\nof passengers or goods at all states of the tide, and accessible for all\r\nkinds of carriage use from the good road which terminated at the top in\r\nfront of a small kind of hotel; it likewise had the desirable security,\r\nfor the greater part of its length, of strong posts with chains between\r\nthem. On the Aust side there was a high- and also a low-water pier, not\r\nfar apart, a little way below the inn, and if the tide served for boats\r\nto reach these all went fairly well after disembarking, but it was a\r\ndifferent matter at half-tide. The half-tide pier was a considerable\r\ndistance from the others—a quarter or half a mile away beneath the\r\ncliffs, and mud and stones and the roughest imaginable affairs in the\r\nguise of road had to be got through or over on the way to the inn. The\r\neffect of this on the springs, paint, &c., of a good Long Acre-built\r\nbarouche, when by some unhappy necessity it had to be committed to such\r\na method of transit, may be easily imagined. The passage for a carriage\r\nwas, at the best, not well arranged. A muster of fishermen or boatmen\r\nwas made, and the carriage was turned on the pier and dragged more or\r\nless rapidly on board, and there, I presume, secured from movement, but,\r\ncertainly, by no means from danger, for part of the freight might\r\nconsist of half a dozen or a dozen bullocks, which shifted to one side\r\nor the other as the vessel lurched. On the whole the transit by the Old\r\nPassage Ferry, so well known in former days, was one link in a chain of\r\nnecessities which left much room for changing times to improve.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great change in the method of travelling may be said to have been\r\npublicly inaugurated in the spring of 1830[22] by the opening of the\r\nCanterbury and Whitstable line of railway.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Bill for the Warrington railway was passed by both\r\nHouses of Parliament, and permission was also granted to construct a\r\nline from Leicester to Swannington, Robert Stephenson being appointed\r\nchief engineer to both lines. But the great railway event of that year\r\nwas the opening, with an imposing ceremonial, on September 15th, of the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway. This left nothing to be desired in\r\nshowing high appreciation of the importance of advance in methods of\r\nlocomotion. Although a complete success, from the point of view of\r\ncapabilities of safe and also of rapid travelling, the day was one of\r\ngreat trouble and anxiety. As the train neared Manchester the mob\r\ncrowded on the lines, and while to have gone forward at any moderate\r\npace would have been death to hundreds, on the other hand, the slow\r\nmovement allowed the populace to swarm on the carriages and display\r\ntheir political aversion to “the Duke” (Wellington) by throwing\r\nbrickbats, and by other objectional irregularities. The riot was not so\r\nmuch remembered as the accident which resulted in the death of\r\nHuskisson. I can recollect the unsophisticated story of something being\r\nseen going along the line at such a speed that it was hardly\r\ndiscernible; and also that a horn was used for train signalling in place\r\nof the steam whistle. Carelessness of life through ignorance of the\r\ndanger was everywhere conspicuous; discipline was much needed. My father\r\nwhile waiting at a station took pleasure in walking along the line to\r\nwhile away the time. Tying horse-carriages on open trucks was not an\r\nunusual practice with carriage-people who could afford to pay for the\r\nluxury. My father long travelled in his own carriage thus attached, and\r\nstepped from the truck on which it stood to the next, but of course at\r\nconsiderable danger to his person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIV.\r\n  A WEST OF ENGLAND ROYAL MAIL _en route_.\r\n  _Original lent by Arthur Ackermann & Son, 191, Regent Street, W._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                CHARTIST RISING IN MONMOUTHSHIRE IN 1839\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of the Chartist[23] rising in Monmouthshire of November,\r\n1839, must have long faded away, except from the minds of the few\r\nsurvivors who were concerned in its suppression, and those of the\r\nyounger generation who remember it from the anxiety it caused throughout\r\nthe district. I came among the latter number. My father was an acting\r\nmagistrate, and at the time alterations were going on in his house at\r\nSedbury Park. I can well remember the surly, disobedient, and generally\r\ninsubordinate behaviour of the local workmen in the week preceding\r\nSunday, the 3rd of November. With the return of the workmen, in the\r\ncourse of the following week, the face of affairs had however changed.\r\nThe rising had taken place, and had been thoroughly crushed. Receiving a\r\nreverse, they were there and then seized with panic, and fled. Their\r\nchief leaders—by name John Frost, Zephaniah Williams, and William Jones,\r\nand others not so deeply implicated—were captured, and to us the result\r\nwas exceedingly satisfactory. The men when they returned were patterns\r\nof obedience and as meek as mice. They did not in the least desire the\r\ndistinction of being known, in a magistrate’s house, to have taken part\r\nin an outbreak which had totally failed. They had thought that by Monday\r\nor Tuesday the house would be in their hands and our relative positions\r\nreversed, and, indeed, it would have been hard to find a house more\r\nindefensible against a disciplined mob than ours. Along two sides of the\r\nhouse (plate I.), ran a broad colonnade of Bath stone, supported by\r\npillars so wide and so placed that in many cases men ascending by\r\nladders put against them, would have been greatly or entirely protected\r\nfrom the discharge of fire-arms from the windows; and the broad flat\r\nsurface of the top of the colonnade, 10 feet in width, by about 120 feet\r\nin length, would have made an admirable mustering ground for scores of\r\nmen, from which to carry on their unpleasant attacks in conjunction with\r\ntheir allies below. This however we were spared.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Frost and the other leaders followed speedily by special\r\nCommission at Monmouth. It began in the following December and ended in\r\nJanuary (1840), with a verdict of guilty of High Treason; and sentence\r\nof death according to the treason penalties of the time was pronounced\r\nby Lord Chief Justice Tindal as follows:—“That you, John Frost, and you,\r\nZephaniah Williams, and you, William Jones, be taken hence to the place\r\nfrom which you came, and be thence drawn on a hurdle to the place of\r\nexecution, and that each of you be there hanged by the neck until you be\r\ndead, and that afterwards the head of each of you shall be severed from\r\nhis body, and the body of each, divided into four quarters, shall be\r\ndisposed of as Her Majesty shall think fit, and may Almighty God have\r\nmercy on your souls.” A recommendation to mercy, which was mercifully\r\nattended to, was added on behalf of the five least guilty men. The\r\npossibility of the horrors of the details of the treason penalties\r\n(though much mitigated from those of former days on account of their\r\nbeing carried out on the dead body of the offender) created\r\nconsternation through the district, and the remembrance has remained\r\nwith me to this day. However, the capital sentence on Frost and his two\r\nspecial associates was commuted to transportation for life, an act of\r\ngrace coincident with those extended on the marriage of our late Queen\r\nof glorious memory.\r\n\r\nOnly the above disjointed reminiscences of trouble have remained in my\r\nmind through the sixty years which have since elapsed, but the rising\r\nwas so planned that, if it had succeeded, it would have proved a match\r\nto light the smouldering Chartism of the Midlands and the North of\r\nEngland, and even under the circumstances the case was described in the\r\nAttorney-General’s address to the Jury at the commencement of the\r\nMonmouth trial as follows:\r\n\r\n“There has recently been in this County an armed insurrection, the law\r\nhas been set at defiance; there has been an attempt to take forcible\r\npossession of the town of Newport, there has been a conflict between the\r\ninsurgents and the Queen’s troops; there has been bloodshed, and the\r\nloss of many lives. The intelligence of these outrages has caused alarm\r\nand dismay throughout the kingdom.”[24]\r\n\r\nWhen divested of the repetitions and technicalities of the reports of\r\nthe sworn witnesses, and also of the addresses of the Lord Chief Justice\r\nand legal authorities, the story of the rising possesses much interest\r\nas an account in many of its details of what could not happen in the\r\npresent day. The mountainous nature of the insurgent locality, the\r\nextraordinarily stormy weather which threw the undisciplined thousands\r\nout in their calculations, and the short, but (for the time occupied)\r\nbloody climax would have formed under such a pen as Sir Walter Scott’s,\r\na narrative of interest almost equal to some of those of the Covenanting\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nThe part of the County in which the disturbances took place—was what is\r\ncalled the “hill district” of Monmouthshire (plate XV.), which has been\r\ndescribed as an area of triangular form, having for its apex to the\r\nsouth, Risca, a town five miles W.N.W of Newport. The base of the\r\ntriangle was at a distance of from fifteen to twenty miles in a\r\nnortherly direction, with the great Beaufort and Nant-y-glo iron works\r\nto the west, on the edge of Brecknockshire, and to the east Blaenavon on\r\nthe Usk in its hilly, or it might be said mountainous, neighbourhood.\r\nThe area of this hill district is varied with hill and dale, intersected\r\nin parts by deep glens, and also by mountain streams, of no\r\ninconsiderable force after heavy rains. Picturesquely considered the\r\ncountry is of great beauty, but beneath the surface are rich supplies of\r\ncoal and iron. For some years before 1839, the mines had been much\r\nworked, and the country, instead of being merely inhabited by a small\r\nand scattered population, was at the time of the outbreak estimated to\r\ncontain above 40,000 inhabitants, often, as it was stated, displaying\r\n“an extent of ignorance very much to be deplored” and consequently\r\neasily led away by the agents of seditious societies and formed into\r\naffiliated bodies ready for outbreak when called on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XV.\r\n  MAP SHOWING THE DISTRICT OF THE CHARTIST RISING IN MONMOUTH.\r\n  NEWPORT NEAR THE LOW RIGHT-HAND CORNER ABOVE THE BEND\r\n  OF THE RIVER USK.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe matured plan of the rising was arranged on the 1st of November at a\r\nmeeting at a place called Blackwood, where there was a Lodge or Society\r\nof Chartists. At this meeting deputies attended, and orders were\r\nformulated, that the men should assemble armed on the evening of the\r\n3rd, the following Sunday. There were to be three principal divisions,\r\none under the command of Frost (then living at Blackwood), the other two\r\nto be respectively formed of men from the up-country, and men more from\r\nthe east and north. These divisions were to meet at Risca at a\r\nconvenient distance from Newport, their destination, which they purposed\r\nto reach about two in the morning. They hoped to find the inhabitants\r\nasleep, and to carry out their plans at their own convenience; attack\r\nthe “intended-to-be-surprised” troops at Newport, break down the bridge\r\nover the Usk, and stop the mail. The Newport mails in those days were\r\nforwarded over the Old Passage of the Severn to Bristol, from which\r\nplace at a given time they were sent North. The non-arrival of the mails\r\nat Birmingham was to have been a sign of success of the Monmouthshire\r\noutbreak, and of a general rising in Lancashire, and other parts of the\r\nkingdom. Affairs, however, turned out very differently to what they\r\nexpected. The night between the Sunday and Monday was the darkest and\r\nmost tempestuous that had been known for years, and consequently though\r\nFrost arrived near Risca early in the night, the other divisions were\r\nlong behind time. Meanwhile Mr. Phillips, the Mayor of Newport,\r\nafterwards Sir Thomas Phillips, a firm and intelligent man, well\r\ninformed of what was going on, had been quietly making preparations, in\r\nview of the intelligence received during Sunday. He had given orders to\r\nthe Superintendent of Police to have a number of Special Constables\r\nready on that evening. A detachment was stationed at the Westgate Hotel,\r\nwhere the Mayor and another magistrate also located themselves about 9\r\np.m., and remained watching throughout the night. When day dawned on\r\nMonday, November 4th, intelligence was received that the insurgents were\r\napproaching, and the Mayor sent a request to the barracks for military\r\nassistance. There was only one company of soldiers (of Her Majesty’s\r\n45th Regiment of foot) stationed at Newport at the time. Of these thirty\r\nmen, under command of Lieut. Basil Gray, were sent to the assistance of\r\nthe Mayor. They arrived at the Westgate Hotel about 8 a.m. The soldiers\r\nwere placed in a room on the ground floor of the hotel with three\r\nwindows (a bow window with three divisions) coming down within a few\r\ninches of the ground, and it should be observed that they did _not_ load\r\ntheir muskets until, after being fired upon, they were ordered to do so.\r\nShortly after the rioters were seen advancing, the numbers being\r\ntechnically stated in the indictment for High Treason as “a great\r\nmultitude ... to the number of two thousand and more,” probably more\r\naccurately computed at 5,000, armed with guns, pistols, pikes, swords,\r\ndaggers, clubs, bludgeons, and other weapons. Amongst the miscellaneous\r\n“weapons of offence” were scythes fixed on poles, and an instrument (of\r\nwhich a specimen was produced in court) called a “mandrel,” used for\r\nworking out coal in the mines, and somewhat resembling a pick-axe in\r\nshape. A portion of the rioters formed in front of the hotel, and at\r\nonce began the attack by firing a volley of small arms at the windows of\r\nthe room where the soldiers were placed, of which the lower shutters\r\nwere closed. They gained entrance to a passage, or corridor,\r\ncommunicating with it by a door. The word was immediately given to load\r\nwith ball cartridge, but whilst the lower window shutters remained\r\nclosed, the men could not reply. Therefore, with the certainty that they\r\nwould be fired on, the Mayor and Lieutenant Gray threw back the\r\nshutters, and stood unmasked facing the insurgents, who immediately\r\ndischarged a volley of small arms, whereby the Mayor was wounded in the\r\ngroin, and seriously in one arm near the shoulder, and Sergeant Daily\r\nwas badly hit in the head. The order to fire was at once given, and\r\nseveral of the insurgents were wounded, and fell. For the short time\r\nthat the conflict lasted the rioters in the house continued to try to\r\nforce the position by rushing up to the doorway; but when they\r\nencountered their own dead and received the return fire of the soldiers\r\nthey faltered, and in less than ten minutes the affray was over. The\r\npassage was cleared of all excepting the dead and wounded, and the vast\r\nmob of rioters was dispersing with all speed. In the words of one\r\nwitness, they “ran to all quarters.” Another deposed that he met numbers\r\nof them near Newport “running back in all directions,” and though here\r\nand there some men remained, they were without arms, and from the\r\nquantity of weapons of offence collected afterwards, it was demonstrable\r\nthat in many cases the men must have flung them away as they fled. But\r\nthough short, the affair had been bloody. The rioters lost seven men\r\nkilled besides a number of wounded, and the casualties to their\r\nopponents were in some cases serious, although not fatal. Hundreds\r\nhurried from the scene of their repulse with such speed that by ten\r\no’clock a.m. they were passing the Lodge Gate of Tredegar Park, about\r\ntwo miles from Newport. Amongst this crowd was John Frost, ex-draper of\r\nNewport and would-be conductor of the outbreak, a man who had proved\r\nhimself as deficient in courage as he had been inefficient in\r\nleadership. He was endeavouring to conceal his identity by holding a\r\nhandkerchief to his face as if he were crying. But on being spoken to\r\nand recognised, he left the road and going through an archway leading to\r\na coppice wood, was lost sight of. A warrant was granted in the\r\nafternoon of the same day, and in the evening, on the door being forced\r\nopen of the house of a man named Partridge (about a quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the Westgate Hotel in Newport), Frost was found and was immediately\r\ntaken into custody. On being searched, three pistols all loaded, a\r\npowder flask, and some balls were found in his pocket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVI.\r\n  CHEPSTOW CASTLE, MONMOUTHSHIRE.\r\n  (_p. 16._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBEGINNING THE STUDY OF ENTOMOLOGY, COLLECTIONS OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGICAL\r\n                    SPECIMENS, AND FAMILY DISPERSAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as a date can be given to what has been the absorbing interest of\r\nthe work of my life, the 12th of March, 1852, would be about the\r\nbeginning of my real study of Entomology. I fancy I attended to it more\r\nthan I knew myself, for little things come back to memory connected with\r\nspecimens being brought to me to name or look at, one in particular\r\nregarding a rare locust. The date was some time before coaches were\r\ndiscontinued, and the usual gathering of people in those days had\r\ncollected at the door of the George Hotel in Chepstow to see the coach\r\nchange horses, when, to the astonishment of all, a fine rose-underwinged\r\nlocust appeared amongst them. Chepstow is on a steep hill, and the\r\n“George” about half a mile from the bridge (plate XVII.). Down the hill\r\nset off the locust, pursued by a party from the George, until it was\r\ncaptured at the bridge, and our family doctor conveyed it alive and\r\nuninjured to me. On my father sending it up to Oxford to Professor\r\nDaubeney as a probable curiosity, he identified it as being the first of\r\nthe kind which had been taken so far west. If he gave us the name, I\r\nhave forgotten it. In March I began my studies by buying my first\r\nentomological book, and I chose beetles for the subject, and Stephens’s\r\n“Manual of British Beetles”[25] for my teacher. Those who know the book\r\nwill understand my difficulties. It has no illustrations, glossary, nor\r\nconvenient abstracts to help beginners, and, if such things existed in\r\nthose days, they were not accessible to me. But I made up my mind that I\r\nwas going to learn, and as _palpi_, _maxillæ_, and names of all the\r\nsmaller parts of the insects were wholly unknown to me, I struck out a\r\nplan of my own. From time to time I got one of the very largest beetles\r\nthat I could find, something that I was quite sure of, and turned it\r\ninto my teacher. I carefully dissected it and matched the parts to the\r\ndetails of the description given by Stephens. The process was very\r\ntedious and required great care, but I got a sound foundation, and by\r\nmaking a kind of synopsis of the chief points of classification I got a\r\nstart. To this day (1891) I have my old Stephens’s Manual with my own\r\npencil markings, that started me on my unaided course. Identification\r\nwas very difficult for a long time, but I “looked out” my beetles\r\nlaboriously till I thought I was sure of the name, and then, to make\r\nquite certain, I took the subject the other way forward—worked back\r\nsystematically from the species till I found that there was no other\r\nkind that it could be. Killing my specimens was another difficulty. I\r\nhad been told that if beetles were dropped into hot water death was\r\ninstantaneous. I was not aware that it should be boiling. So into the\r\nkitchen I went with a water beetle, which in after years I found must\r\nhave been _Dytiscus marginalis_—a large water beetle which has great\r\npowers of rapid swimming—got a tumbler of hot water, and dropped my\r\nspecimen in. But to my perfect horror, instead of being killed\r\ninstantaneously, it skimmed round and round on the water for perhaps a\r\nminute as if in the greatest agony. This was my second lesson;\r\nthenceforward I supplied myself with chloroform.\r\n\r\nMy first experience in the use of the microscope was gained by helping\r\nmy brother William to prepare botanical specimens for examination under\r\nhis microscope. I thus had useful practice early in life, 1849 (?), in\r\nthe management of a good instrument. I bought my own about 1864, after\r\nmy brother John’s death—one of Pillischer’s—a good working instrument\r\nwith excellent 1-inch and ¼-inch lenses on a nose-piece. I first studied\r\nwith it the hairs of different animals. I also worked preparations of\r\nteeth, showing the fluid contents when in a fresh state.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVII.\r\n  CHEPSTOW WITH THE ROAD BRIDGE OVER THE WYE (OPENED IN 1816), CHEPSTOW\r\n    CASTLE ON THE RIVER-BANK, AND RISING GROUND BEHIND.\r\n  _Frith photo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the number of the “Gardeners’ Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette” for\r\nAugust 1, 1868, the announcement was made that “Throughout the month of\r\nAugust there will be open in the Palace of Industry, in the Champs\r\nÉlysées, Paris, an Exhibition which we conceive cannot fail to be of\r\ngreat service in extending a knowledge of the destructive or beneficial\r\nhabits of various species of insects.... The Exhibition is organised by\r\nthe ‘Société d’Insectologie Agricole’ under the Presidency of Dr.\r\nBoisduval, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Horticultural Society of\r\nParis, and under the auspices of the Minister of Agriculture, Commerce,\r\nand Public Works. The object of this Society (and consequently of the\r\nExhibition itself) is twofold: firstly, to investigate the economy and\r\nto extend the benefits resulting from insects serviceable to mankind;\r\nand secondly, to study the habits of those species which affect our\r\ngardens, orchards, farms or forests, in order to arrest their ravages or\r\ndestroy them individually.”\r\n\r\nDetails were given at some length of the classes of subjects to be\r\nrepresented, in the hope that it might attract the attention of the\r\nCouncil of our own Horticultural Society to the desirability of\r\narranging some similar exhibition, and, on the 22nd of August following,\r\nthe public were informed (again in the “Gardeners’ Chronicle,” p. 893)\r\nthat “the desideratum lately pointed out as falling within the province\r\nof the Royal Horticultural Society to supply, viz., a Collection of\r\nInsects (and their products), is now in a fair way to be made good.” A\r\nshort sketch was given of the plan on which it was proposed to deal with\r\nthe subject, in which the “insect friends” of the horticulturist were\r\nthe division to be placed first. Following these were to be “gardeners’\r\nenemies,” and the plants on which they feed; next to these again,\r\n“insects beneficial or injurious to man.” Negotiations on the part of\r\nthe Council of the Royal Horticultural Society with the Science and Art\r\nDepartment resulted in the agreement that, if the Society would form the\r\nCollection, the Department would house, care for, and display it. The\r\neminently qualified Fellows of the Society, Mr. Wilson Saunders, Mr.\r\nAndrew Murray (pp. 75 and 87), and Mr. M. J. Berkeley, agreed to lend\r\ntheir best assistance in the matter, and Mr. Murray, at the request of\r\nthe Council, undertook the most laborious part of the task—that of\r\nreceiving, arranging, and putting in order the various specimens that\r\nmight be sent from time to time. All collectors and observers who might\r\nbe willing to help were requested to communicate with Mr. Murray, and\r\nwithout delay I availed myself of the opportunity, in pleasant\r\nanticipation of the entomological co-operation giving a use to what had\r\nbeen previously somewhat desultory observation.\r\n\r\nI was singularly well situated for the collection of ordinary kinds of\r\ninjurious insects, and for the observation of their workings, as I then\r\nresided on my father’s Gloucestershire property. The extent was not very\r\ngreat, only about 800 acres, but the nature of both the land and the\r\ncultivation afforded wonderful variety of material for commencing a\r\ncollection. The wood- and park-land included old timber trees in some\r\ninstances dating back to the time of the Edwards, and also plenty of\r\nordinary deciduous woodland and coppice. The fir plantations supplied\r\nconifer-loving forest pests; the ordinary insects of crop and garden\r\nwere of course plentiful; the woodland and field pools added their\r\nquota; and the diversity in exposure from the salt pasturage by the\r\nSevern to the various growths up the face of the cliffs to about 140\r\nfeet probably had something to do also with the great variety of insect\r\nlife. I had willing helpers in the agricultural labourers—when they had\r\nmade up their minds whether they would assist or not. They had always\r\nhelped, for we were on very friendly terms, and some of them or their\r\nchildren, like myself, had been born on the estate. But, though I did\r\nnot know it at the time, I heard afterwards that when I asked for such\r\nspecial help they held a sort of informal meeting to consult whether it\r\nshould be granted. Happily they settled that I was to be helped because\r\nthe rural counsel stated I made use of what I got. The verdict was\r\nsatisfactory in practical results, but I had my own private opinion that\r\nwhat were sometimes called “Miss Eleanor’s shillings” helped the cause\r\nof collection. From the commencement of work until my father’s death,\r\nwhen I ceased to have command of the large area of ground, I collected\r\nand sent the results to the charge of Mr. Murray. Communication was\r\nentirely carried on by letter.\r\n\r\n[N.B.—Miss Ormerod’s work was gracefully acknowledged by the Royal\r\nHorticultural Society awarding her the Floral Medal (plate XXII.).]\r\n\r\n_Family Dispersal._\r\n\r\nMy father’s last days were happy and painless, and were passed in\r\ncomfort under the attendance of my sisters and myself, whom, in the\r\nfailing condition of his powers of exertion he preferred to all other\r\nsociety. We deeply felt the happiness of ministering to his welfare, for\r\nhe would not hear of our leaving him for even twenty-four hours, and he\r\nobjected to visits from my brothers excepting occasionally for a short\r\ntime. They, not being used to the gentle ways necessary for an aged\r\ninvalid, worried him. His last illness, however, was short. On the\r\nMonday preceding his decease he was able to come downstairs to his nine\r\no’clock breakfast as usual, and the Thursday following—the 9th of\r\nOctober, 1873—he passed gently away, at the mature age of eighty-seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded in the property by his eldest son, the Venerable\r\nThos. Johnson Ormerod, Archdeacon of Suffolk, and Rector of\r\nRedenhall-cum-Harleston, Norfolk, who had held the post of Examining\r\nChaplain to two bishops of Norwich, Dr. Stanley and Dr. Hinds, and had\r\nbeen requested to hold it once again by their successor, Dr. Pelham.\r\nThis however, he declined, not feeling disposed in his own advancing\r\nage to continue in the laborious though honourable office. On my\r\nfather’s death, my brother resigned his living,[26] and moved with his\r\ntwo unmarried daughters to Sedbury. From his standing as a clergyman\r\nof high position, who had long mixed in literary society, and also as\r\na country gentleman, it had been hoped that he would make Sedbury a\r\nliterary and county centre, as it had been in my father’s time. But\r\nhis life was unexpectedly closed at the age of sixty-five by a sudden\r\nillness. He died on 2nd December, 1874, and the property passed to his\r\neldest son, the Rev. G. T. B. Ormerod, then, or shortly before, curate\r\nof Stroud.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[A short account of Miss Ormerod’s brothers other than the eldest above\r\nreferred to—all men of ability and diligent workers—will complete this\r\nchapter of family history.\r\n\r\n“Two entered the Church; the third brother, John, was the holder of the\r\nPort Fellowship of Brasenose and bursar of that college; and the\r\nyoungest, Arthur, spent his life in parish work as Vicar of Halvergate,\r\nin Norfolk.\r\n\r\n“The fifth brother, William, and the sixth, Edward, became students at\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s Hospital, to which institution their uncle, Dr. Peter\r\nMere Latham and his father, Dr. John Latham, had been physicians.\r\nWilliam’s health failing, he left London, and after a few years’\r\npractice at Oxford, where he was surgeon to the Radcliffe Infirmary, he\r\nretired to Canterbury, and there died at a comparatively early age.\r\nEdward distinguished himself as a physician and as a naturalist. He too\r\nwas debarred by bad health from practising in London, but in Brighton he\r\nbecame physician to the Sussex County Hospital, and was for many years\r\nthe leading consultant of the town. He wrote several excellent papers on\r\nmedical subjects, and his monograph on “British Social Wasps” brought\r\nhim the fellowship of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n“The second brother, Wareing, and the fourth, Henry, started as\r\nsolicitors in Manchester.

It had been bought by the tenant at a sale at Hulgreve\r\n    Hall (an estate of the Astons, who participated in the division\r\n    of the religious spoil at the Reformation), and it was\r\n    traditionally said to have come from this hospital. It appears\r\n    to have been one of the chests used to keep vestments and\r\n    chalices, &c., in, and is about two feet broad, by five in\r\n    length, and two feet nine inches in height; at each end are two\r\n    compartments, and in front five, all of which except the central\r\n    one are sumptuously carved in imitation of rich Gothic windows\r\n    with canopies, crockets, finials, buttresses, and shrine work.\r\n    The centre represents the coronation of Henry VI., and the\r\n    _single_ rose occurs over the _fleur-de-lis_ in the ornaments.\r\n    The chest is figured in Plate 44 of ‘Specimens of Gothic\r\n    Architecture in England,’ by Augustus Pugin, 1822; and a\r\n    description is given at page 27.\r\n\r\n    “A chest, of a description precisely corresponding with it, was\r\n    recently offered for sale at Liverpool, with the Brereton\r\n    painted glass, and described as having been formerly the church\r\n    chest at Ashton-under-Lyne.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XVIII.\r\n  ANTIQUE CARVED CHEST, AN HEIRLOOM OF THE ORMEROD FAMILY.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCOMMENCEMENT AND PROGRESS OF ANNUAL REPORTS OF OBSERVATIONS OF INJURIOUS\r\n                                INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1877 I issued a short pamphlet of seven pages, entitled\r\n“Notes for Observations of Injurious Insects,”[27] in which I suggested\r\nhow much a series of observations in relation to insect ravages on food\r\ncrops was to be desired; this not merely for scientific purposes, but\r\nwith a view to finding means of lessening the amount of yearly loss\r\nwhich tells so heavily on individual growers, and also on the country at\r\nlarge. I pointed out shortly that many insect attacks could be remedied,\r\nif attention were directed to the subject; and also that many would\r\nprobably be found, if reliable information could be procured, to be\r\ncoincident with multiplication or diminution of insect life. On the way\r\nin which this increase and decrease were affected by surroundings, such\r\nas plants, &c., suitable for food or shelter; by agricultural\r\nconditions, such as drainage, nature of the soil and of manures; and\r\nalso by the state of the weather—I gave some guiding notes, and\r\nrequested information from agriculturists and entomologists, who were\r\nboth practically and scientifically qualified to aid in the matter. I\r\nalso added some short remarks as to the nature of the entomological\r\nobservations desired; as of date, and amount of appearance of larvæ\r\n(grubs); amount of injury caused; and any other points of use and\r\ninterest that might occur to the observer. And further (as some sort of\r\nassistance in the commencement of the plan of campaign) I gave a list of\r\nabout eighteen of our commonest crop, fruit, and forest insects, with\r\nshort descriptions in the very plainest words I could use, in most cases\r\naccompanied by illustrations.\r\n\r\nAs my name was then little before the public, although I had worked on\r\nentomology for a good many years, I requested permission of two of my\r\nscientific friends, the Rev. T. A. Preston, one of the masters of\r\nMarlborough College, and much interested in phenology (_i.e._,\r\nobservation of natural phenomena); and Mr. E. A. Fitch, Secretary of the\r\nEntomological Society, to allow me to add their names as referees. To\r\nthis they kindly consented, but with the stipulation from Mr. Preston\r\nthat he did not wish to co-operate further. I believe I may say with\r\nregard to Mr. Fitch such a very small amount of communication took place\r\nthat it would not have been worth while to mention the matter, excepting\r\n_pro forma_, on account of the names being recorded. These were soon\r\nremoved from succeeding reports as unnecessary. The pamphlet was widely\r\ncirculated and the request for observations was responded to far more\r\ncordially than could have been expected. Notes regarding insect\r\nappearances, together with observations of their habits, and of\r\npracticable methods of prevention, were forwarded by observers—who were\r\nqualified both as technically scientific and practical workers—from\r\nlocalities scattered over the country as far north as Aberdeenshire in\r\nScotland and south to Hants and Devonshire in England. In fact the\r\ncommunications were quite sufficient to show that the plan was approved\r\nof from an agricultural point of view, and might be continued hopefully.\r\nIn after years I was told that it was very well received by the press. I\r\nhave been greatly indebted since both to the agricultural and general\r\npress, but at the time it did not seem to me to be peculiarly warmly\r\nwelcomed, nor I think was it likely to be, until it had more to say for\r\nitself. The pamphlet was not of many pages; the knowledge of the great\r\nmischief caused by insect pests, and the need of prevention of their\r\nravages, was not spread abroad as at the present day, and I was not able\r\nat first to utilise to the best advantage the information sent as I had\r\nno working reports of my own to help me as to examples of the best\r\nmethods of arrangement.[28]\r\n\r\nFrom the first I had excellent contributions. Various members of our\r\nEntomological Societies were good enough to send me notes on insects to\r\nwhich they devoted special study, and so also were members of the\r\nMeteorological Society, regarding points of natural history, bird life,\r\nweather, &c., connected with entomological considerations, and regarding\r\nwhich they were special observers. Agriculturally I had good help also\r\nfrom other quarters, and amongst many who assisted me, I will take leave\r\nto especially give the name of the late Mr. Malcolm Dunn, the Duke of\r\nBuccleuch’s superintendent at the Palace Gardens, Dalkeith, N.B. We\r\nnever met, but whenever I applied to him he was unfailing in prompt and\r\nserviceable reply. As a commencement, the introductions with which he\r\nfavoured me to the leading foresters and horticulturists of North\r\nBritain, were of such invaluable aid that I should be ungrateful not to\r\nmention his name as of one to whom I owe a deep debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn the report for the year 1881 I altered the plan of arrangement to one\r\nwhich so far as I can judge met all that was needed for practical as\r\nwell as scientific service so conveniently that I have since adhered to\r\nit. The information was classed under headings of (_a_) farm crops,\r\n(_b_) orchard and bush fruits, and (_c_) forest trees, regarding which\r\nobservations of insect attack were forwarded. These headings were\r\narranged alphabetically, for instance: Apple, Bean, Corn and Grass, Hop,\r\nOak, Peas, Pine, Turnip, &c., &c. Any information as to live stock or\r\nanimal insect pests was similarly placed (that is, alphabetically)\r\namongst the other attacks, under the headings of Deer, Grouse, Horses,\r\n&c., &c., as the case might be; but beyond what was absolutely\r\nnecessary, as in the case of Ox warble, I endeavoured to avoid entering\r\non stock infestations as leading to investigations very unpleasant to\r\nmyself either to make or to discuss, and very much better left in the\r\nhands of veterinary surgeons. Following each heading, the observations\r\nwere placed which had been contributed during the season, and which\r\nappeared to be of sufficient interest to be recorded, regarding the\r\nspecial crop, or fruit, &c., referred to, these being given with\r\nlocality and date, as far as possible in the contributor’s words, and\r\nover his own name, unless by request, or for some special reason. This\r\nplan of giving the very fullest recognition possible of the source of\r\nthe information, I, for three very special reasons, most strongly\r\nrecommend to the consideration of all my readers not fully accustomed to\r\npractical reporting:\r\n\r\n1. That thus the information may very often carry conviction with it by\r\nthe name of some well-known agriculturist or cattle-breeder being\r\nappended.\r\n\r\n2. That to do otherwise is a robbery of the credit of the contributor,\r\nand a false appropriation of it by the reporter, wholly unbecoming an\r\nhonest worker.\r\n\r\n3. That the full recognition is a great protection to the reporter or\r\ncompiler of the reports from plagiarism of his own work. There are\r\npeople who think nothing of appropriating the credit of true workers,\r\nand who absorb also rewards in the shape of salaries and official\r\nposition based on their own questionable conduct.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1881 it seemed desirable to change the running heading at\r\nthe top of the pages. The name of the crop, fruit, or other subject to\r\nwhich the paper referred was henceforward placed at the top of the\r\nleft-hand page, and the name of each successive attack to it at the top\r\nof the right-hand page; as, for instance, Cabbage at the left side, and\r\nthe different kinds of infestations recorded during the year which might\r\noccur to Cabbage, as Cabbage butterfly (large white), Cabbage-root fly,\r\nCabbage moth, on the right-hand heading. At the beginning of each paper,\r\nthe name of the crop, or fruit, was given in large capitals, and beneath\r\nand at the heading of each successive paper, the name of the injurious\r\ninsect to be referred to, also in English, with the scientific name, and\r\nauthority for the same following. The observations of contributors were\r\ninserted unbroken, so that the methods of prevention and remedy noted as\r\nsuccessful by each observer were thus recorded in connection with the\r\naccompanying peculiarities of cultivation, soil, manure, weather, &c.\r\nThe whole life history of the insect, so far as known or accessible, was\r\ngiven, and sometimes, as in great attacks or in special circumstances, a\r\n“summary” of the preceding recorded information; this being, wherever\r\npossible, followed by some paragraphs or pages of “Methods of Prevention\r\nand Remedy.”\r\n\r\nIn matters of phraseology, selection of the very plainest and shortest\r\nwords that I could choose was part of my plan, and after the first few\r\nyears I exchanged the short table of contents for a plain working index.\r\n\r\nIllustration always appeared to me a very important part of the work, so\r\nthat readers might start with the knowledge of the appearance of the\r\ninsects under consideration, gained by a glance at the accompanying\r\nfigure, without having the trouble of trying to form a kind of “mind\r\npicture” from the descriptions given, often very unlike the true\r\nobject.[29] At first—in the small beginning—the numbers needed were also\r\nsmall, and I think the little stock of figure blocks with which I\r\nstarted, and for which I was indebted to the kind courtesy of a friend,\r\namounted to _one dozen!_ This matter, however, I set right as soon as\r\npossible by the purchase from Messrs. Blackie & Sons, of Glasgow, of\r\nelectros of most of the beautiful wood engravings given in Curtis’s\r\n“Farm Insects,” under an agreement that the accommodation was granted on\r\ncondition of my using the figures only in my own publications. Some of\r\nthe illustrations I drew myself on the blocks, and as time went on, and\r\ninfestations, little or not at all entered on before, required\r\nillustration, I engaged the valuable assistance of two brothers,[30]\r\nwhich was continued thenceforward throughout the work. It appears to me\r\nthat it is hardly possible to exceed the beauty of their work, whether\r\nin characteristic representation or in precise and accurate details. I\r\nhave had great pleasure in the entomological approval which has been\r\nbestowed upon it. Illustrations from other sources have of course been\r\nused, always, so far as I am aware, most carefully acknowledged; and so\r\nfar as has been in my power, I have endeavoured that the illustration of\r\neach infestation should show the insect (where it was possible to do so)\r\nin each of its successive stages of life, as of the caterpillar or\r\nmaggot (scientifically the _larva_); the chrysalis (_pupa_); and the\r\nperfect insect, butterfly, beetle, sawfly, &c., as the case might be.\r\nThis matter is of great importance agriculturally, for how else (it may\r\nbe asked) in common circumstances, excepting by a good, plain\r\nillustration, is a farmer or fruit-grower to know what the connection is\r\nbetween the grubs and maggots which he finds underground or on his trees\r\nand the moths or beetles which he may notice in his fields or orchards.\r\nTo give a single instance, how seldom the grey, cylindrical, legless\r\ngrubs of the Daddy Longlegs are known to have anything to do with the\r\nlarge, gnat-like, two-winged flies which are to be seen floating over\r\nour grass-fields in legions where the larvæ have been destroying\r\nunderground. And so the work went on, and I believe that I may say\r\nthat—from the great amount of useful information contributed, together\r\nwith my own co-operation in entomological verification, adding requisite\r\ndetails, publishing the year’s communications, and distributing them to\r\nmy contributors—it answered fairly the purpose for which it was set on\r\nfoot. And year by year we gained knowledge till we possessed serviceable\r\ninformation on the main points, both of habits and means of prevention\r\nof the greater number of our really seriously injurious farm, orchard,\r\nand forest pests of Britain.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to investigate in detail the various kinds of infestation\r\nnoticed during the first twenty-two years of my observations will find\r\nthem in “The General Index to my Annual Reports on Injurious Insects,\r\n1877-1898,” compiled at my request by Mr. Robert Newstead.[31] In this\r\nindex the insects are arranged alphabetically under their popular and\r\nalso under their scientific names, with references to the various Annual\r\nReports in which notices of their observation are recorded, or papers\r\ngiven on them, and also of the pages in each paper containing\r\ninformation on their habits and history and means of prevention. Lists\r\nare also given of crops and plants, stock, &c., affected. The index thus\r\naffords a fair summary of the advance of our knowledge of crop\r\ninfestation during the years referred to.[32]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1881 I published a digest of the information sent in up to\r\ndate in an octavo volume of 323 pages, very fully illustrated, entitled\r\n“Manual of Injurious Insects, with Methods of Prevention and Remedy”;\r\nand in 1890 I followed this by a much enlarged demy-octavo second\r\nedition of 450 pages, bearing the same title. In 1898, under the title\r\nof “Handbook of Insects Injurious to Orchard and Bush Fruits, with Means\r\nof Prevention and Remedy,” pp. 280, I included the special observations\r\non fruit infestations which had been sent me. In 1900 I published a\r\npamphlet (also illustrated) entitled “Flies Injurious to Stock” (pp.\r\n80), [p. 304] giving reports of observations of life history and habits,\r\nand also of means of prevention of a few kinds of infestation. These\r\nwere given as shortly as they could serviceably be dealt with, excepting\r\nin the case of the Warble fly, _Hypoderma bovis_. Into this it appeared\r\ndesirable to enter more fully, it having been under my observation since\r\nthe year 1884, and having been carefully written on in every detail of\r\nhabits and means of prevention, as observed by my contributors and\r\nmyself in this country.\r\n\r\nBesides the above publications, I arranged, for gratuitous circulation,\r\nvarious four-page leaflets on our commonest farm pests. Each contained\r\nan illustration and as much information as I could manage to condense\r\ninto the limited space. Among the subjects discussed were the widely\r\ndestructive Wireworm and equally destructive grubs of the Daddy Longlegs\r\nor Cranefly, the Mangold-leaf maggot, the Mustard beetle, the minute\r\nStem eel-worm (which causes the malformed growth of cereal plants known\r\nas “tulip root” and does much harm in clover shoots), the Warble fly and\r\nthe troublesome Forest fly. Our recent investigations have proved this\r\nlast to be present in two other districts at least, besides the New\r\nForest and its vicinity in Hampshire, to which previously it had been\r\nsupposed to be almost limited (p. 138). For the leaflet on the Warble\r\nfly, its history, and easily practicable methods of prevention and\r\nremedy, there has been such a large demand that various issues have been\r\nsuccessively printed amounting to 170,000 copies, including 15,000\r\ncopies which the Messrs. Murray, of Aberdeen, requested permission to\r\nprint at their own cost.\r\n\r\nThe original plan (or rather that which gradually formed in the first\r\nfew years) of arrangement of the Annual Reports appeared to meet all\r\nrequirements, so long as the requirements of the case remain unaltered.\r\nYear after year such information as had been asked for was sent,\r\ngradually completing most of the histories of our seriously injurious\r\ncrop and orchard insects, but in the report for 1899 it was requisite to\r\nmake some arrangement for insertion of disconnected additional\r\nobservations of appearance, habits, &c., of insects, previously referred\r\nto. These I gave accordingly in an appendix under the heading of “Short\r\nNotices,” not to encumber the report with repetitions that could be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, when about to publish my report of observations of the\r\npreceding year, it appeared to me that a large proportion of the new\r\ninformation contributed bore on points of scientific entomological\r\ninterest, or of occasional appearance of little observed attacks of very\r\nlittle interest or use to the majority of our agriculturists and orchard\r\ngrowers, and quite foreign to the broad scale consideration of pests,\r\nwhich was the object of these reports. It seemed something more than\r\n_un_necessary to continue this work, and I, therefore, inserted the\r\nfollowing notice in the preface of my Annual Report for 1900, thus\r\nclosing the series with the closing century:—\r\n\r\n“_But now, although with much regret, I am obliged to say that I feel\r\nthe time has come for discontinuing this series of Annual Reports._ When\r\nI commenced the work in 1877, comparatively little was known of the\r\nhabits and means of prevention of insects seriously injurious to our\r\ncrops, and of this little a very small amount was accessible for public\r\nservice, and I undertook the series of reports in the hope (so far as in\r\nmy power lay) of doing something to meet both these difficulties.\r\nFirstly, by endeavouring to gain reliable information of the kind\r\nneeded; and secondly, by publishing this, with all requisite additions,\r\nand especially with illustrations, at a price far below the publication\r\nexpenses, so that it might be accessible to all who wished to purchase,\r\nbut especially by sending a copy of each Annual Report to each\r\ncontributor who had favoured me with useful information. It seemed to be\r\nbut right and fair that those who kindly helped in the work should have\r\ntheir courtesy acknowledged to the best of my power, and I have\r\ncontinued the reciprocation throughout. But the work was hard; for many\r\nyears for about five or six months all the time I could give to the\r\nsubject was devoted to arranging the contributions of the season for the\r\nAnnual Report of the year, with the addition of the best information I\r\ncould procure from other sources (in every case, whether of contributors\r\nor otherwise, _fully acknowledged_). As the consultation enquiries were\r\nkept up during winter as well as summer, I found the work, carried on\r\nsingle-handed, at times very fatiguing. But so long as there appeared to\r\nbe a call for it, I have tried to do what I could. Now, however, the\r\nnecessities of the case have (as a matter of course) been gradually\r\nchanging. Year after year information has been sent, gradually\r\ncompleting the histories of most of our worst insect pests, and now\r\nadditional information is rare (as is to be expected after twenty-four\r\nyears’ observations) on points of great agricultural importance.\r\n\r\n“I claim no credit to myself in the work; but those who will look over\r\nthe names of the contributors, given with their information, will see\r\nhow deeply indebted I am to them, and to other good friends, who have\r\nplaced their experience and great knowledge at the public service. To\r\nthem, and to all who have assisted me, and to some who have allowed what\r\nbegan as agricultural communications to ripen into valuable friendship,\r\nI offer my grateful thanks and my deep appreciation of their goodness,\r\nand I trust they will believe that if, as I well know, much of my work\r\nhas not been so well done as it would have been in better qualified\r\nhands, at least I have earnestly tried to do my very best.”[33]\r\n\r\nOn the publication of the above-mentioned report, I received many kind\r\nletters from friends, and I was much gratified by the press allusions on\r\nthe matter. These, obviously, it would not be desirable for me to do\r\nmore here than just allude to generally, with my thanks.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                      SAMPLES OF LEGAL EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a good many years after my name had been before the public as an\r\nofficial Consulting Entomologist that I began occasionally to receive\r\napplications to furnish what is called “expert” evidence regarding\r\ninsect infestation of live crops, or of cargoes of flour. To work this\r\nproperly, and without risk of being confused under examination by the\r\nhost of questions, relevant or irrelevant, and, of course, made\r\npurposely perplexing by the legal representatives of the opposing side\r\nof the case, involved a most inconvenient amount of research and also of\r\nmental strain. It was necessary to keep all points in any way likely to\r\nbe referred to, classed in order in the mind, and available\r\ninstantaneously without hurry or confusion; and sometimes also necessary\r\nin helping non-entomological cross-examiners so to formulate their\r\nquestions as to admit of any answer being given.\r\n\r\nMy first experience of anything of this kind was in July, 1889, when I\r\nreceived a copy of a letter written by myself on September 20th of the\r\nprevious year relative to a certain insect attack, of which specimens,\r\ntogether with samples of the infested plants, had then been sent me.\r\nThis letter was accompanied by an enquiry whether I could swear to the\r\naccuracy of my statements. This, of course, I had no doubts about. It\r\nwas a perfectly simple case, and I replied accordingly. The result was\r\nthat one morning before luncheon my sister came into my room in\r\nperplexity, and announced that there was a “young man” in my study who\r\nwanted to speak to me, but who he was, or where he came from, or\r\nanything except that it was just for a minute that he wished to see me,\r\nnobody had been able to make out. I believe I guessed pretty well the\r\nnature of the mysterious business; but, as for explanation, the young\r\nman was perfectly impenetrable, excepting on two points. One that he was\r\nto give me a paper which I accepted, and next that he was to give me\r\nsome small amount of money, which I also accepted, not knowing whether\r\nany other course was open to me. As this was the first (and also last)\r\ncase of a subpœna being served on me, I do not know whether the immense\r\nreticence is part of the business, or whether the server is possibly in\r\ndanger of bad language or unpleasant treatment, but certainly the\r\nvisitor appeared very uneasy, and took himself off as soon as possible.\r\nOn examining the paper I found it called me to give evidence on the side\r\nof the defendants, which was a little awkward, as after due\r\ninvestigation of details I found that the entomological circumstances\r\nwould give the case for the plaintiffs. It ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n“In the High Court of Justice between Thomas Wilkinson, Plaintiff, and\r\nThe Houghton Main Colliery Company, Limited, Defendants. Victoria, by\r\nthe Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nQueen, Defender of the Faith, to Miss Eleanor A. Ormerod, of Torrington\r\nHouse, St. Albans, in the County of Herts. Greeting.—We command you to\r\nattend before our Justices assigned to take the assizes in and for the\r\nWest Riding Division of the County of York to be holden at Leeds on\r\nWednesday the 24th day of July, 1889, at the hour of ten in the forenoon\r\nand so from day to day during the said assizes until the above cause is\r\ntried to give evidence on behalf of the Defenders, &c.”\r\n\r\nOn the back of the document was inscribed (name and address given) that\r\nthe writ was issued by the London Agents of J. Parker Rhodes, of\r\nRotherham, Yorkshire, defendants’ solicitor. I felt myself very\r\nunpleasantly situated, more particularly as one of my legal brothers\r\nassured me that I should make myself (or be made) quite ridiculous in\r\nCourt, but I did not see the matter quite in this light, for I was sure\r\nof my facts. I explained to the solicitor for the defendants that if put\r\nin the witness box I must support the cause of the plaintiff. The case\r\nwas then withdrawn and costs allowed to the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nTen years afterwards I was employed by Messrs. Ross T. Smyth and Co.,\r\n33, Mark Lane, London, E.C. The case was entered on March 9, 1899, and\r\nthe matter in question was alleged infestation of a cargo of flour,\r\ntransmitted from New York, U.S.A., to Durban, S. Africa. I gave evidence\r\non oath here, Torrington House, St. Albans, on October 20, 1899, before\r\nMr. E. K. Blyth (of Messrs. Blyth, Dutton, Hartley and Blyth), appointed\r\na Commissioner of the High Court of Natal, to take my evidence in the\r\ncause of Smyth _v._ Findlay. On Tuesday the 24th following, Mr. E. K.\r\nBlyth attended with depositions which I read and signed in his presence.\r\nSubjoined is a copy of my “Report on Insect Presence,” and also an\r\nextract from a confirmatory report made by Mr. Oliver Janson doubly\r\nconfirmed by the report of a representative of the Department of\r\nAgriculture, Division of Entomology, Washington:—\r\n\r\n“I have examined the contents of the box and bottle this day submitted\r\nto me from yourselves, the bottle being under seal of Messrs. Randle\r\nBrothers and Hudson, Durban, Natal, &c., &c. I made my examination\r\nboth with hand magnifiers and microscope and found that in the very\r\nsmall amount of insect presence in the wheat flour and in the spirit\r\nor preservative fluid, there were two kinds of beetles represented.\r\nOne of these was the _Tribolium ferrugineum_, popularly known as the\r\nRusty-red flour beetle (fig. 70). This is a small red-brown, or\r\nyellowish-red-brown, beetle, about a sixth of an inch long, somewhat\r\nparallel-sided and narrow in proportion to its length; the wing-cases\r\nstriated longitudinally, and the antennæ (or horns) with a\r\nthree-jointed club at the extremity. I found this beetle present in\r\nall its stages of development; that is, as a comparatively long and\r\nnarrow larva (grub or maggot); in the chrysalis (pupa) state, in which\r\nit resembles the beetle with its limbs folded beneath it until\r\ndevelopment is complete; and the perfect beetles.\r\n\r\n“I also found one specimen of what is called the _Cadelle_ in larval\r\n(grub or maggot) state. This is a pitchy-coloured beetle, _Trogosita\r\nmauritanica_ or _Tenebrioides mauritanicus_, rather larger than the kind\r\nabove named, being about four times longer. I examined the whole amount\r\nof insect infestation sifted in my presence from the wheat flour under\r\nconsideration or taken out of the bottle of preservative fluid, and in\r\nthe very small amount of insect presence observable, I found nothing\r\nelse to which the slightest degree of importance could be attached. In\r\nreply to the inquiry submitted to me, as to the possibility of the bags\r\nof wheat flour under consideration having been infested when they were\r\nshipped from New York, on or about July the 5th, 1898; I can state that\r\nI fully believe the flour could not then have been infested, as in such\r\ncase—consequent on the well-known exceedingly favourable conditions for\r\nmultiplication of insect presence, through which the bags of flour would\r\npass during the voyage—there would certainly by the date of arrival at\r\nDurban, on or about September 14th, have been so great an amount of\r\ninfestation in all stages, that it could not have been overlooked. And\r\nby the further dates named, in the following October and November, it\r\nwould have been overwhelming. The exceedingly high temperatures through\r\nwhich the shipment would pass are known to be very favourable to rapid\r\npropagation of successive generations of _Tribolium_. It is to be borne\r\nin mind that the infestation does not lie in a torpid state, but after\r\nhatching from the egg (sometimes inaccurately called the “germ”), which\r\nsoon occurs in high temperatures, it passes through the changes from\r\nlarva (or grub) to chrysalis, and beetle condition more or less quickly\r\naccording to warmth of locality; and then the male and female beetles\r\npair, and in the ordinary course die, in the case of the female after\r\negg-laying. Examination of the condition of the flour, had infestation\r\nbeen present, would have shown not only the living infestation, but also\r\nthe dead bodies of the previous generations of beetles, which being of a\r\nhard and horny nature externally, would not have decayed in the flour.\r\n\r\n“Further, not only is great warmth favourable to increase of\r\n_Tribolium_, but also the conditions, when flour is placed in bags and\r\nleft unopened for any length of time, are especially suited to their\r\npropagation. I can also state that the effect of _Tribolium_ infestation\r\non flour is such that its presence even to a small amount could not be\r\nunobserved, and these characteristics were wholly absent in the flour\r\nsubmitted to me. To the best of my knowledge and belief I consider it to\r\nbe absolutely and demonstrably impossible that the infestation regarding\r\nwhich the inquiry is now before me could have been shipped from New\r\nYork, and after the most careful examination and investigation which I\r\nam able to make, I consider that the infestation took place after the\r\narrival of the flour at Durban.\r\n\r\n“May I, in addition to the above opinion, be permitted to suggest to you\r\nthat as this investigation is one of great importance, it might be\r\nsatisfactory to yourselves if you were also to submit the samples, which\r\nI have re-secured under my own seal, to Mr. Oliver E. Janson, F.E.S., as\r\nbeing a skilled entomologist, and so well qualified by personal\r\nobservation and scientific knowledge of the _Coleoptera_ (beetles), to\r\ngive ma correct opinion in the present matter, that I should consider\r\nhim to be the most thoroughly trustworthy English referee.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Janson’s report was as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Having carefully examined the specimens of insects submitted to me\r\nunder seal of Miss E. A. Ormerod, and stated to have been found in the\r\naccompanying sample of flour, named ‘Radiant,’ ‘Strathness,’ also the\r\nspecimens of insects, &c. &c., I identify them as the coleopterous\r\ninsect, known scientifically as _Tribolium ferrugineum_, in its various\r\nstages of larva (grub), pupa (chrysalis), and imago (beetle). I also\r\nfind a single specimen of _Trogosita mauritanica_.... In considering the\r\nimportant question as to origin of the infestation, I am of opinion that\r\nthe evidence afforded clearly indicates the origin of the infestation to\r\nhave been subsequent to the arrival of the flour at Durban.”\r\n\r\n[The case never came to trial, but the unanimity of the expert opinion\r\nenabled Messrs. Ross T. Smith & Co. to effect a compromise on terms they\r\nwere willing to accept.]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following letter addressed to us by Mr. Wm. Simpson of Messrs. R. &\r\nH. Hall, Limited, of Cork, Dublin, Belfast and Waterford, shows a\r\nsimilar satisfactory termination to a case in which granary weevils had\r\ndone serious damage to a cargo of flour from San Francisco.\r\n\r\n“WESTPORT, _Feb. 6, 1900_. DEAR MADAM,—Perhaps you have not quite\r\nforgotten my visit to you in early summer of last year when I submitted\r\nfor your inspection a sample of flour with weevil infestation from a\r\ncargo landed here. It will I am sure interest you to know that we have\r\njust settled the case out of Court by the owners of the vessel paying us\r\n£900 and our costs. We are pleased that the matter is thus ended, but I\r\ncannot forbear from again thanking you for all the attention and help\r\nyou gave us in the case and which was to us of the greatest value. Yours\r\nvery truly, (Sgd) WM. SIMPSON.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                   BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY THE EDITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe removal of Miss Ormerod and her sister, Georgiana, from Torquay to\r\nSpring Grove, Isleworth, was primarily because Torquay did not suit\r\ntheir health and secondarily because at Isleworth they were near Kew\r\nGardens, where they were on intimate terms with Sir Joseph and Lady\r\nHooker. They left again for Torrington House, St. Albans, in September,\r\n1887, partly because Sir Joseph resigned the Directorship of Kew Gardens\r\nin 1885 and partly because of the increase of population, and the\r\ndefective and unwholesome drainage of the house. In a letter (p. 74) to\r\nDr. Bethune, one of her esteemed Canadian correspondents, she refers to\r\nher impending change of residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DUNSTER LODGE, SPRING GROVE, ISLEWORTH.\r\n                                                   _August 7, 1887._\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MR. BETHUNE,—I have very often lately been hoping to\r\n    hear of your safe arrival, and I am very glad to hear of it; but\r\n    I am so sorry that I cannot have the great pleasure of seeing\r\n    you to-morrow, for I have to be at St. Albans to meet a number\r\n    of people on business from noon till 4 p.m. This is a great\r\n    disappointment to me, for I (we) had much looked forward to a\r\n    chat with you. I am longing to hear of my kind friends in Canada\r\n    and especially of Mr. Fletcher and Professor Saunders, and I\r\n    want much to ask you how to transmit so much of a set of my\r\n    entomological publications as I can get together for acceptance\r\n    by the Entomological Society of Ontario.[35] I cannot tell you\r\n    how much I respect and admire the working of that noble Society,\r\n    and I feel myself greatly honoured by being elected one of its\r\n    members. Hessian fly (fig. 15) is indeed becoming a scourge—and\r\n    the work is enormous—it is a different story now to when I was\r\n    so roundly sneered at last year for thinking it had come. If we\r\n    had our grand Entomological Society of Ontario here things might\r\n    have been very different. I trust you may be able to spare, if\r\n    only one hour to give us just time to confer a little on your\r\n    return. I would put aside any ordinary engagement for the\r\n    pleasure and also the benefit of an entomological conversation.\r\n    But now about my sister and myself. This place is fast becoming\r\n    very unsuitable for us—you will know all that is involved in the\r\n    rapid increase of the outskirts of London—and we have a notice\r\n    of most of our garden going to be offered for sale next year for\r\n    small building plots. Therefore we are making arrangements to\r\n    move about the end of next month to St. Albans. We have many\r\n    good friends and fellow-workers there or near, and the place is\r\n    very healthy, and very accessible both for London and the\r\n    country, and I can, I trust, do my work much more fully there.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Miss Ormerod Lady Hooker has written: “When she was our neighbour\r\nduring our residence at Kew, she was a frequent visitor at our house and\r\noften came in the morning before public hours to the Gardens, to pursue\r\nher researches and look for the insects to be found on the trees, shrubs\r\nand plants; on these occasions she generally lunched with us and we\r\ndelighted in her bright and intellectual conversation. She was extremely\r\nfond of animals and birds, and could imitate the calls of the animals\r\nand the notes of many birds so perfectly that she could collect the\r\ncreatures around her; it was curious to see the squirrels peep out from\r\nthe trees when she called to them and venture to her feet for the nuts\r\nshe scattered for them. Her observation was always on the alert and she\r\nsaw many minute things in nature that others would have passed by. She\r\nwas a fine artist—and so was her sister, Miss G. Ormerod. At one time my\r\nhusband was needing some drawings made for the _Botanical Magazine_ and\r\nshe offered her services and drew three or four very beautifully.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XIX.\r\n  TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS, HERTS, MISS ORMEROD’S LAST RESIDENCE.\r\n  (_p. 115._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nLady Hooker made a practice of inviting Miss Ormerod and her sister to\r\ncome over and help to entertain distinguished visitors at great\r\nfunctions and on the occasion of visits of official scientific parties.\r\nOn one occasion the whole Chinese Embassy, excepting the Ambassador\r\nhimself, came in Chinese costume. Miss Ormerod asked permission of Lady\r\nHooker to speak to the Naturalist, who talked English very well. The\r\ninformation elicited however was but trifling, amounting to the fact\r\nthat in China a yellow powder (probably flowers of sulphur) was used to\r\ndress plants to ward off disease. She suggested tea as an escape from a\r\ndisappointing position and then adjourned to the tea-room followed by\r\nthe whole Embassy. The Entomologist took tea, but another minor member\r\nof the group, being reputed at times to indulge in potations to which\r\nthe hosts were not accustomed, gave great cause for anxiety by taking\r\npossession of a wine bottle. Miss Ormerod was successful in spiriting\r\nthe bottle away and in substituting a cup of tea, but great was her\r\nrelief when Sir Joseph and Lady Hooker arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\nAt Kew she also met Andrew Murray, Secretary of the Royal Horticultural\r\nSociety, who did excellent work in Economic Entomology for the Bethnal\r\nGreen and South Kensington Museums. Miss Ormerod described him as a\r\n“profoundly scientific and intellectual man.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting instance of the widespread benefit of Miss Ormerod’s work\r\nand the affection with which her name and personality were revered by\r\nher distant correspondents was supplied by Dr. Lipscomb, her trusted\r\nmedical attendant. He says:—\r\n\r\n“My sister was talking to a small market gardener in a flower garden she\r\nwas painting near Penzance, and Miss Ormerod’s name happened to be\r\nmentioned. The old gardener was beside himself with delight to meet some\r\none who knew Miss Ormerod. He said she had saved him from utter ruin.\r\nHis flowers had become infected with some injurious insect which bade\r\nfair to devastate the whole garden. In despair, hearing of Miss Ormerod,\r\nhe wrote to her and not only received a kind letter of advice, but also\r\na copy of her work on ‘Injurious Insects’ with the page turned down and\r\nthe paragraphs specially applicable to the case marked. No wonder the\r\npoor old chap with tears in his eyes said he loved his unknown\r\nbenefactress.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod was appointed Consulting Entomologist to the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England in 1882, and for ten years retained that\r\nhonourable position to the advantage of the Members and the British\r\npublic generally.\r\n\r\nThe need of a Consulting Entomologist was forcibly brought home to the\r\nSociety, then under the presidency of Mr. J. Dent-Dent, by the\r\ndisastrous attack in 1881 of the Turnip fly, or more correctly flea\r\nbeetle, which resulted in an estimated loss of over half a million\r\nsterling to farmers in England and Scotland. Leading agriculturists all\r\nover the country, but more from the East than the West, supplied\r\ninformation for a report, and special assistance was given by some\r\nmembers of the Royal Agricultural Society, including Mr. J. H. Arkwright\r\nof Hampton Court, Herefordshire. The results were embodied in the Annual\r\nReport for 1881, published in 1882.\r\n\r\nA short time after this event a request was made to Miss Ormerod to\r\nindicate whether she would accept the post of Consulting Entomologist to\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society. Urged by Mr. Charles Whitehead, Chairman\r\nof the “Seeds and Plant Diseases Committee,” and by her intimate\r\npersonal friend Professor Herbert Little, another member of the Council,\r\nshe accepted, but with hesitation and with considerable reluctance,\r\nengendered by the opposition of her sister Georgiana, who believed her\r\nstrength was not equal to the strain of additional work. The meeting\r\nwith members of the Council at the Society’s offices, 12, Hanover\r\nSquare, London, at which details were discussed, was unusually trying,\r\nin spite of the kindly courtesy of the Secretary (Mr. H. M. Jenkins) for\r\nwhom Miss Ormerod entertained the deepest regard. She says, writing in\r\n1900, “I was nearly frightened out of my wits in going through the\r\nrequested ordeal, and the recollections of the experiences remain as\r\nuniquely unpleasant. On arriving, I gave my card to the attendant, who\r\nled me upstairs, where I expected to meet but two or three people, and I\r\nwas ushered into a room full of gentlemen standing waiting my arrival,\r\nnot one of whom except Professor Little was known to me even by sight. I\r\nadvanced about two feet, my sole thought being of the awkward fix in\r\nwhich I had so suddenly been landed, and how I should get out of it.\r\nScarcely a word was spoken when I was led down again to the Secretary’s\r\nroom, where a discussion took place with Professor Little, Mr.\r\nWhitehead, the Secretary, and the President of the Society,—the others\r\nremained absent. In the discussion the President attempted a slight\r\nexamination of my qualifications, but it amounted to little more than\r\neliciting the length of time during which attention had been devoted to\r\nEntomology. My reply was “about thirty years,” to which he had nothing\r\nfurther to say. There was a slight departure from the serious nature of\r\nthe interview when a parcel of Daddy longlegs grubs which had been\r\nplaced on the table, gave way, and the creatures crawled all over the\r\nplace. The final result was, that I agreed to take the post of\r\nConsulting Entomologist, but I returned home very uneasy in mind and\r\nwrote the same evening that I did not wish to accept office. I was,\r\nhowever, pressed into acceptance at the first business meeting and the\r\nfirst work I undertook was the making of drawings to form originals for\r\nsix diagrams illustrating some common injurious insects with life\r\nhistories and methods of prevention.[36] This would be the first Tuesday\r\nof June, 1882, and I inaugurated my position on the way home by meeting\r\nwith a severe accident at Waterloo Station, from the results of which I\r\nhave never recovered. While doubtless rather preoccupied, crossing the\r\nroad, a rapid incline from Waterloo Road to the station, I did not\r\nnotice a carriage coming down the slope till the horses’ heads were over\r\nmine. With no time to run or turn, I sprang and landed on the pavement,\r\nbut a sharp pain set in, in the muscle above one knee. Whether it\r\noriginated from a strain or a blow I never knew, but a little flask I\r\ncarried on the injured side was beaten in as if by a horse’s foot or the\r\npoint of a carriage pole. The injury was not properly attended to and\r\nthe affected part gradually increasing and spreading gave rise to the\r\nlameness accompanied with severe and frequently intermittent pain which\r\nnecessitated exceeding quiet and bodily inactivity—a state of matters\r\nwhich was in marked contrast to the extremely active life I had led in\r\nmy early years rambling in the country, and latterly by indulging in the\r\nmechanical in addition to the usual æsthetical pleasures of gardening.”\r\n\r\nShe explains in a letter to Dr. Fletcher, dated August 22, 1892 (p. 212)\r\nthat she was driven by failing health to resign her honorary official\r\nwork and to concentrate her energies upon her private work, which\r\nsteadily increased in volume, and especially on the work of her Annual\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA conception of the interesting methods adopted by Miss Ormerod in\r\ncarrying out her work may be gleaned from her own words addressed to us\r\nin the course of a long and intimate correspondence.\r\n\r\n“I will now try and think of something you may care to insert about\r\nlanguages. So far as I can avoid it, I try not to write in any language\r\nbut my own, but I can read serviceably French, Italian, and Spanish, and\r\nalso Latin for what I need; likewise, of course, German; Russian I could\r\nread once but not so readily now; and with the dictionary I can make\r\nsomething of Dutch and Norwegian.”\r\n\r\n“Of my very special colleagues who are now gone from us, were Professor\r\nWestwood, Life President of the Entomological Society, and Dr. C. V.\r\nRiley, Entomologist of the Board of Agriculture of the U.S.A.; and\r\nProfessor Huxley, in days when I sat on the Council of Education\r\nCommittee of Economic Entomology, was a valued friend. It was marvellous\r\nto see how Huxley with his towering personality led a committee. On one\r\noccasion he asked if any one present would express an opinion on the\r\nsubject under consideration, and he rather suddenly directed his\r\nattention to a certain member of committee, who was so startled he\r\nnearly got frightened out of his life.”[37]\r\n\r\n“The regular course of my work brings me into such constantly recurring\r\ncommunication with the Entomological Departments of our own Colonies,\r\nalso of many of the U.S.A. States, and various Continental Societies or\r\nspecialists, that I may venture to say that as occasion occurs we\r\ninterchange—I mean the heads of the Departments and myself—friendly\r\nobservations, very beneficial and pleasant to me. The plan of my work\r\nhas long been to reply, if I could do so soundly, to every enquiry on\r\nthe day of receipt. Often investigation is needed for scientific\r\npurposes, but a large proportion of the enquiries may be answered at\r\nonce so far as the practical needs of the enquirers are concerned. For\r\nfurther purposes my custom is to work up anything new or involved that\r\noccurs, for use in the following Annual Report. I do not devolve on my\r\nspecialist referees the researches (so far as I can ascertain the state\r\nof the case), but they tell me if my identification is correct, or\r\ncorrect it for me, and I quite invariably, if the matter be for\r\npublication, publish also my acknowledgment. The correspondence\r\ncontinues steadily all the year round, more of course in the warm\r\nseasons of the year than at other times, but even in winter it never\r\nceases. My plan has generally been to store up all the observations of\r\nthe growing (and consequently insect-attacking) times of the year till\r\nautumn, and then sort them and prepare them for the Annual Report of\r\nthat year. If some favourite subject be under discussion the letters may\r\nbe very numerous. I once had a run of 60, 80, to 100 a day for a short\r\ntime, including on one day a total of 149—but of course on such an\r\noccasion I was obliged to get help to keep reply at all in hand. The\r\nsteady letter work of the year I estimate at about 1,500.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReferring on December 27, 1889, to a proposal which had been made to\r\nprocure an assistant to relieve her of the enormous pressure of work,\r\nshe says:—\r\n\r\n“I need not point out that, however agreeable the post might be to my\r\nso-called ‘assistant,’ to me the addition would be a trouble—loss of\r\ntime and other inconveniences beyond telling. It would be more trouble\r\nto write to him than to attend myself, and as a referee he would be\r\nalmost useless. My reference work is to the leading men of the\r\nworld—those who are known, literally, as the authorities above all\r\nothers on the special points; thus I am in no way derogating from the\r\nrespect I bear to Professor Harker’s[38] knowledge, but who that knew\r\nanything would have cared for his opinion on _Icerya purchasi_ (scale\r\ninsect of orange trees)? Dr.Signoret’s opinion carried all before it.\r\nAgain, no one’s opinion stands like that of Mr. G. B. Buckton on\r\nAphides, and he communicates with me whenever I ask.\r\n\r\n“On that most important agricultural matter, _Tylenchus devastatrix_,\r\nthere is no one in England fit to form an opinion worth comparison with\r\nDrs. de Man and J. Ritzema Bos, by whom I am favoured, through being\r\nallowed any amount of communication. These, and men like these,\r\npre-eminent each in his own line, are the referees that I personally am\r\nhonoured by being allowed to ask aid from; and in my own humble way\r\nsometimes I can reciprocate, but ‘an assistant’ would do me no good in\r\nany of these matters. And with regard to agricultural and applied\r\nbearings I do not want a _dictum_, but year by year by my own\r\ncorrespondence with agriculturists to work out on the fields the parts\r\nof the cases as they occur, and to give the points to the public in my\r\nreports. I am responsible for the entomological work of the R.A.S.E.,\r\nand unless it goes through my hands I do not know what may be going on,\r\nand no one would know to whom to write, or, in fact, anything definite\r\nabout the matter, if there were an assistant. I have my own circle of\r\nhelpers, my own paid special referee, by whom I reach specialists out of\r\nmy circle, and my lady amanuensis in the house, besides my good sister’s\r\ninvaluable aid—always promptly and ably given. So long as I can I hope\r\nto keep my work in my own hands, and if it were not for the great masses\r\nsometimes sent me, which come because I have been (up to the present\r\ntime) the only Official Entomologist here, the work would not have been\r\nso distressing. Professor Harker is, I believe, excellently qualified to\r\nhold a good and high entomological post, but not even Professor Riley or\r\nProfessor Westwood would work a post without referees. Some day, I hope,\r\nhe may be high in office; then he will, as I do now, have his organised\r\ncorresponding staff.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“As a meteorological observer, while living at Isleworth my work\r\nconsisted in taking notes on about eighteen different subjects once a\r\nday, beginning at 9 a.m., Greenwich time precisely. These included\r\ntaking the readings of the maximum and minimum temperatures, and also\r\nthose other thermometrical conditions, as of dry and wet bulb, solar,\r\nearth, and ground thermometers, &c.; likewise of rainfall in the past\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, of the state of weather at the time; the nature\r\nof the clouds, with the amount and direction of them, and likewise the\r\ndirection and estimated speed of wind. The time occupied out of doors in\r\nthe observations was about twenty minutes, to which had to be added the\r\nbarometrical reading with that of the attached thermometers, with\r\ncorrections according to tables furnished for altitude of the barometer,\r\nand such minute errors in record of the thermometers as were shown by\r\ntables of error furnished by comparison with the instruments at the\r\nRoyal Observatory, Kew. Altogether the work required some considerable\r\namount of time, and also most scrupulous attention to accuracy, not to\r\nsay some amount of personal self-denial, as whatever the weather might\r\nbe at 9 a.m. the work had to be done. Perhaps there would be a\r\nthunderstorm, or at other times cold so great that my fingers almost\r\nfroze to the instruments, as on one occasion, when the thermometer\r\nregistered nearly down to zero.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XX.\r\n  MISS ORMEROD AT HER METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATION STATION,\r\n  NEAR ISLEWORTH.\r\n]\r\n\r\nProfessor Westwood belonged to the good old academic type of scholar who\r\nmade the responses in church in Latin. He was, till his death, Miss\r\nOrmerod’s mentor from her initiation into Entomology, and she regarded\r\nhim as the greatest living scientific authority in the broad lines of\r\ntheir common subject during the whole period of her advisory work. They\r\n“got on famously,” and as she said, he “took the privilege,” which she\r\nhighly appreciated, “of knocking her work about,” as the subjoined\r\nletter, written at an early stage of her career as an authoress,\r\ncharmingly shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          UNIVERSITY MUSEUM, OXFORD,\r\n                                                 _January 10, 1884_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—I congratulate you on the publication of\r\n    your “Guide to Methods of Insect Life”—the nicest little\r\n    Introduction to Entomology with which I am acquainted. You have\r\n    been very fortunate in obtaining such a good series of woodcuts,\r\n    many of which were new to me. Allow me to suggest one or two\r\n    improvements after a hurried glance over the contents. It would\r\n    have been well to have indicated more precisely the size of some\r\n    of the objects figured; for instance, the locust, p. 28, is\r\n    twice the size of the figure—whilst the earwig, on the same\r\n    page, is about one-half the length of the figure. In p. 98, the\r\n    Death’s-head moth, which is twice the size of the Eyed-hawk\r\n    moth, is represented smaller than it is in next page. In p. 118\r\n    the fly is the _Sirex juvencus_, not the commoner one _S.\r\n    gigas_. In p. 125 the Bee parasite has not the front portion of\r\n    the wings black, but as milky as the other part. In p. 73, line\r\n    8, for “glassy” read “glossy.” I know you will thank me for\r\n    these hurried suggestions, or I would not have troubled you with\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    Thanks for your kind enquiries. I am thankful to say that after\r\n    two months’ attack of bronchitis I am nearly all right again,\r\n    but have been much confined to the house, although I have been\r\n    wanting to go to London. My kind remembrance to your sister. We\r\n    should be very glad if you could come and give us a visit for a\r\n    short time.—Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                     J. O. WESTWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high terms of approval and appreciation of her work by Miss\r\nOrmerod’s numerous foreign correspondents are shown in no halting manner\r\nin the subjoined letter:—\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Dr. J. A. Lintner, New York State Entomologist._[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        ALBANY, N.Y.\r\n                                                     _May 29, 1889._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—I must congratulate you upon your last\r\n    Report. It is excellent, and reflects great credit upon you. I\r\n    am very glad that your letters have been so appreciated that it\r\n    has been necessary to summon a lady private secretary to your\r\n    aid. It will be a satisfaction to you that you will now be able\r\n    to accomplish much more than before. I am led to think whether I\r\n    should not ask our next Legislature to provide for an assistant\r\n    for me.\r\n\r\n    Your kind letter of the 10th inst. was also duly received. How\r\n    strange, and how very interesting to me, that you should\r\n    discover _Cecidomyia leguminicola_ (Gnat midge), red maggot,\r\n    with you, as you have done, working at the root—only “infesting\r\n    the root,” and not, so far as known, attacking the head. If it\r\n    occurs on the blossoms, you should have been able to find it\r\n    there by the time that this reaches you, for, as I have\r\n    somewhere mentioned, the nearly-mature larva shows a disposition\r\n    to leave the clover heads very soon after they are picked. You\r\n    ask if I have observed this form in other cecids of the clover.\r\n    We have, so far as known, but one other clover cecid, and that\r\n    is your introduced _C. trifolii_ (Clover leaf midge). The\r\n    thought suggests itself to examine some of my dried\r\n    _leguminicola_ larvæ. I am glad to have found in my collection\r\n    examples preserved in alcohol of the larvæ which I had\r\n    forgotten. As I put up quite a little quantity of them, I can\r\n    spare you these, which I am sure will be acceptable to you.\r\n\r\n    Your investigation of the “warble” presence (p. 110) effect upon\r\n    the beef-eater will, I am sure, be of much importance. One of\r\n    our Western agricultural papers has commenced an investigation.\r\n    Probably your studies and publications have incited them to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 12, 1894._\r\n\r\n    In going carefully over several pages of your seventeenth\r\n    report, which came to me last week, I asked myself, “Is not this\r\n    the best report that Miss Ormerod has written?” You are pleased\r\n    to bestow praise on my reports, which from you is agreeable to\r\n    receive, but I think that I can judge of their true value, and\r\n    very glad indeed would I be if I could feel that they were up to\r\n    the standard of yours. These are far from words of flattery, but\r\n    are said because I believe that you need encouragement. Your\r\n    reports have high merit and value, beyond similar writings of\r\n    any of your English contemporaries—yes, far beyond.—As ever,\r\n    sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                      J. A. LINTNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n            BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH BY THE EDITOR (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a public lecturer Miss Ormerod achieved a high measure of success.\r\nThe first effort in this capacity was made at the Royal Agricultural\r\nCollege, Cirencester, where as “Special Lecturer on Economic\r\nEntomology,” she delivered six interesting and valuable addresses to\r\naudiences of about 120 students and professors on: (1) Injurious\r\nInsects; (2) Turnip Fly; (3) Effects of Weather on Insects; (4)\r\nWireworm; (5) Insect Prevention; (6) Œstridæ—Warble or Bot Flies. The\r\nfirst was given in October, 1881, and the last in June, 1884. On the\r\nfirst occasion Lord Bathurst, one of the Governors of the College, was\r\npresent, and Miss Ormerod was placed between Principal McClellan on the\r\none hand and Professor Harker (biology) on the other, as her sister\r\nGeorgiana humorously remarked afterwards, “for fear her courage should\r\nfail and she run away.” Her anxieties in the new capacity knew no\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nAlthough extremely nervous and anxious she succeeded in concealing this\r\nfrom an attentive and appreciative audience, and made an excellent\r\nappearance.[40] She declared that while walking from the drawing-room to\r\nthe large lecture theatre at the opposite corner of the college\r\nquadrangle she could not utter a word, and on this, as on other somewhat\r\nsimilar exciting occasions, she experienced a drumming in her head which\r\nshe failed to moderate by any attempted remedial measures. After about\r\nthree years’ experience as a supernumerary member of the college staff,\r\nit was found that the preliminary preparation of the lectures was\r\nrobbing her steadily increasing general work of time which was\r\ninconveniently spared, and, although it was considered an honour to be\r\ninvited to give special lectures, she felt it to be a duty to her main\r\nwork to retire.\r\n\r\nDuring this period one lecture was delivered before the “Institute of\r\nAgriculture,” at South Kensington, in April, 1883, in the Lords of\r\nCouncil lecture hall, where as usual she was in a state of trepidation\r\nas to what might happen. The audience numbered about five hundred—two\r\nhundred and fifty of whom were Government students. The subject was\r\n“Insect Injuries to Farm Crops, and their Prevention.” A number of minor\r\nincidents were nevertheless disturbing. To begin with, the driver who\r\nhad been engaged to take the lecturer first to South Kensington and\r\nagain in the evening to Isleworth, started on the wrong journey first,\r\nbut the mistake was discovered before he had gone very far astray. Then\r\na chairman had failed to appear and another had to be anxiously watched\r\nfor at the door. A most suitable person was at last found in the\r\nPresident of the Entomological Society. All went well for a time until\r\nMiss Ormerod’s sight on the left side wholly failed. Being subject to\r\nattacks of migraine from overwork, she thought one of these had come on,\r\nbut on moving a little to the right she discovered that a brilliant\r\nlight had been arranged to fall on the diagrams, and that to her great\r\ndiscomfort she had got into the line of it.\r\n\r\nA rather amusing incident occurred as the last distraction. The object\r\nwas to place the elements of Entomology before the students in the\r\nsimplest form possible, but a few definitions were first necessary. They\r\nwere told to realise in the words of Professor Westwood that insects\r\nwere “Annulose animals, breathing by tracheæ, having the head distinct\r\nand provided in the adult stage with six articulated legs, and antennæ,\r\nsubject also to a series of moultings previously to attaining\r\nperfection, whereby wings are ordinarily developed!”\r\n\r\nThe audience burst out cheering, thinking, as Professor Tanner[41]\r\nexplained afterwards, that the scientific terms were being used as a\r\njoke.\r\n\r\nApropos of this experience she wrote on October 14, 1890, to Mr. Robert\r\nNewstead, “If I could find time I would like to form an instructive\r\nbook, on the plan of which I enclose a few lines—so as to proceed\r\ngradually from a foundation well known to the pupils—thus:—\r\n\r\n“_Q._ What is an insect? _A._ A fly is an insect, so is a moth or a\r\nbutterfly, or a wasp, or a grasshopper, or a cricket.\r\n\r\n“_Q._ Is a spider an insect? _A._ No.\r\n\r\n“_Q._ Why not? _A._ Because it has eight legs, and never has any wings.\r\nInsects in their perfect state have six legs, and usually either one or\r\ntwo pairs of wings.\r\n\r\n“_Q._ Why do you say in their perfect state? And so on.\r\n\r\n“I believe that it is an absolute mistake to begin with a definition of\r\nan insect such as is usually given—half the words of which are utterly\r\nwithout meaning to the student.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder strong pressure at a later date, Miss Ormerod delivered in the\r\nsame hall a course of ten lectures in five consecutive days, on the\r\n“Orders of Insects,” and these were reproduced in full in her “Guide to\r\nthe Methods of Insect Life.”\r\n\r\nThe organisation was defective, and very small audiences assembled.\r\nProfessor Axe and others who gave special lectures in the same course\r\nhad the same experience. Only £10 was paid to Miss Ormerod for her share\r\nof the work, a sum which did not cover outlays, and apart from the\r\nannoyance of the bungling the fatigue was great.\r\n\r\nAbout this course, Professor Huxley wrote on November 11, 1883:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Dear Miss Ormerod,—I am very glad to welcome you as a\r\n    colleague—and I wish I could come and hear your lectures, being\r\n    particularly ignorant of the branch of Entomology you have made\r\n    your own. I shall be very glad if any of my students can find\r\n    time to profit by your teaching—but I suspect that their hands\r\n    are pretty full. We shall be very glad to have your sister’s\r\n    work and thank her for the trouble she has taken.—Ever yours\r\n    very truly,” &c.\r\n\r\n    When a copy of the book reached him in the following January he\r\n    again wrote:—“Many thanks for your ‘Guide to Insect Life.’ I\r\n    know enough of your portion of work to be sure that it will be\r\n    clear, accurate, and useful, and I hope that the public will\r\n    show a due appreciation of it. With best wishes, &c.\r\n\r\n                                                     “T. H. HUXLEY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker also wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 ROYAL GARDENS, KEW,\r\n                                                 _January 11, 1884_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—Pray accept my best thanks for the copy of\r\n    your “Guide to Methods of Insect Life.” I have read the first 50\r\n    pages at intervals of my work with great pleasure and interest.\r\n    I was an Entomologist before I took to Botany, as was my father\r\n    before me, and I do enjoy in my old age the account you give of\r\n    the forgotten habits of the friends of my early youth. I think\r\n    it is capitally well done and suited to its purpose, and I shall\r\n    hope to interest my children with it in the holidays. With\r\n    united sincere regards to you both, most truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     JOS. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March, 1882, a paper on “Injurious Insects” was read at a meeting of\r\nthe Richmond Athenæum. The hall was so crammed that the Council were\r\ncrushed up on the platform. “At the close of the lecture” (Lady Hooker\r\nwrites) “Miss Lydia Becker, at that time a vigorous upholder of ‘Woman’s\r\nRights,’ rose to speak, and while praising Miss Ormerod’s able lecture,\r\ninstanced her work as ‘being a proof of how much a woman could do\r\nwithout the help of man.’ Miss Ormerod, in her reply, thanked Miss\r\nBecker, but begged to say that she had no right to the praise accorded\r\nto her on the ground of her work being so entirely that of a lone woman,\r\nfor, she said, ‘No one owes more to the help of man than myself. I have\r\nalways met with the greatest kindness and most generous aid from my\r\nfriends of the other sex, and without their constant encouragement my\r\npoor efforts would have had no practical result in being of benefit to\r\nmy fellow men.’”\r\n\r\nIn the discussion which followed the lecture Sir Joseph Hooker “referred\r\nto the great benefit they had derived at Kew Gardens from Miss Ormerod’s\r\nresearches, remarking that to her and her sister (Georgiana) they owed\r\nsome of the best illustrations they had of insect ravages upon plants.\r\nHe could not but allude also to the elegance and clearness of the\r\nlanguage employed by Miss Ormerod in her paper as an illustration that\r\nscientific matters might be put in a clear and simple form, so that all\r\nmight understand them.... In conclusion he thanked Miss Ormerod and her\r\nsister for their services to science.”\r\n\r\nAbout 1888 an entomological “At Home” was given at Torrington House, St.\r\nAlbans, when some sixty people assembled in the drawing-room and\r\nlistened to a most interesting dissertation on the “Hessian Fly,” given\r\nby the hostess in a friendly and informal conversational manner.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers’ Club lecture in 1889 was felt by Miss Ormerod to be the\r\nmost important and most gratifying of all similar public appearances.\r\nShe prepared it with infinite care and, as the time fixed for its\r\ndelivery approached, the state of nervous tension was great. Leading\r\nagriculturists were present, and a number of ladies came to make\r\ninquiries about all sorts of things, but probably the lecturer would\r\nhave been equally well pleased had none of her own sex put in an\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Miss Ormerod was invited by the Lords of the Committee of\r\nCouncil on Education to become a member of a committee to advise in the\r\nimprovement of the collections relating to Economic Entomology in the\r\nSouth Kensington and Bethnal Green Museums. The other members of\r\ncommittee were Professor Huxley, Mr. W. Thisleton Dyer, Professor J. O.\r\nWestwood, Mr. F. Orpen Bower, Professor Wrightson, and Mr. Moore—Colonel\r\nDonnelly and Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen being present officially. After\r\nserious consideration and a good deal of pressure from influential\r\nquarters, Miss Ormerod accepted the invitation and was a most useful\r\nmember of committee till her withdrawal from it in April, 1886. She\r\ncontinued, however, to assist the supervision of the work, which went on\r\nfor some time after. At the first meeting she was asked to prepare a\r\nscheme for a series of illustrations of Economic Entomology, and her\r\nsuggestion of classifying injurious insects by the name of leading plant\r\naffected, and not by the Natural Orders of the creatures, was accepted.\r\nA collection of cases containing natural specimens in all stages of\r\ndevelopment, as well as accurate drawings of them, though never\r\ncompleted, was made, at first mainly under Professor Westwood’s\r\ndirection, but later on, under Miss Ormerod’s supervision. Many of the\r\nspecimens were taken from Mr. Andrew Murray’s earlier contributions.\r\n\r\nThe collection was in 1885 removed from Bethnal Green to the Western\r\nExhibition Galleries, South Kensington Museum. The value of Miss\r\nOrmerod’s services and the esteem in which she was personally held by\r\nher associates in connection with the work of the committee, may be\r\ngathered from the subjoined letter sent to her by Professor Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 12, 1883._\r\n\r\n    DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—Many thanks for the trouble you have taken.\r\n    Your suggestion about utilising the figures which are not\r\n    specially wanted for our purpose, for schools, seems to me\r\n    excellent, and I hope you will bring it forward at our next\r\n    meeting.\r\n\r\n    I hope our first discussion has convinced you that we want\r\n    nothing but to achieve something useful. And as I have at any\r\n    rate learned how to recognise practical knowledge and common\r\n    sense, when I meet with them (they are not so common as people\r\n    imagine) you will find me always ready to do my best to aid in\r\n    carrying out your views. You really know more about the business\r\n    than all the rest of us put together.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                       T. H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Ormerod was associated with the Bethnal Green Museum she was\r\nasked to look at the proofs of a series of insect diagrams illustrating\r\n“Gardeners’ Friends and Foes” being prepared for publication by the\r\nScience and Art Department. She found that an official of the Museum had\r\nbeen guilty of wholesale plagiarism, both in the coloured figures and\r\nthe descriptive letterpress, and moreover that a number of figures of a\r\npopular kind had been introduced which were not drawn with scientific\r\naccuracy, that she felt conscientiously impelled to report the\r\nirregularities and deficiencies to the authorities. The results were\r\nthat the diagrams were withdrawn (only a few sets having been presented\r\nfor private use to certain fortunate individuals); and the removal of\r\nthe official from the position of trust became a wholesome lesson to\r\nthose who lightly make use without acknowledgment of the work of others.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt a later date she arranged the descriptive matter of a series of\r\nbeautiful insect diagrams, the originals of which were drawn and\r\ncoloured by her sister, Georgiana, for the Royal Agricultural Society,\r\nand referred to in the appended facsimile page of a letter addressed to\r\nthe present writer, and again at p. 210 of her correspondence.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT SPECIMEN OF MISS ORMEROD’S CLEAR AND CHARACTERISTIC WRITING\r\nIN WHICH SHE CONDUCTED HER VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  May 12^{th} 1891.\r\n\r\n  Torrington House St. Albans.\r\n\r\n  Dear Prof Wallace\r\n\r\n    Your letter was a great\r\n  pleasure to us, and my sister\r\n  was delighted to hope that\r\n  her diagrams may be of such\r\n  general use\r\n\r\n    I have now written to\r\n  Mr. Newman begging him to\r\n  write to you replying to\r\n  your enquiries,—and also\r\n  to send (to your kind acceptance\r\n  from my sister) by Parcel post\r\n  samples of the diagrams, so\r\n  far as they are printed\r\n  completely. That is with\r\n  the exception of the fly which\r\n  you have.\r\n\r\n    You ought I am sure to\r\n  see for yourself just what\r\n  it is that we are about\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo Miss Anne Hartwell, Miss Ormerod’s private secretary and confidential\r\ncompanion, I am indebted for many of the following incidents in the home\r\nlife. The two sisters, though they were never robust, enjoyed\r\ncomparatively good health, when Miss Hartwell, in May, 1888, went to\r\nreside with them, and were at all times very busy. Miss Ormerod\r\n(Georgiana) usually sat in the dining-room working at her diagrams and\r\nMiss Eleanor in the study. They generally worked all the morning, and in\r\nthe afternoon they would walk out together, take a drive, or pay calls.\r\nThey frequently had visitors for a few days, and nephews and nieces\r\nwould come and go—which was always a pleasure to them. They were devoted\r\nto each other and spent much time together. Miss Georgiana’s death, on\r\nAugust 19, 1896, was a sad blow to Miss Eleanor, who missed her sister’s\r\ncompanionship and sympathy dreadfully. To a casual observer time seemed\r\nto heal her wounded feelings and she appeared cheerful and bright, but\r\nin reality she was never again quite the same person—they had been such\r\nlifelong friends and companions.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Rev. C. J. Bethune she wrote on October 12, 1896:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I thank you gratefully for your kind comforting letter; believe\r\n    me such words as yours are a great consolation and support to\r\n    me, for I do miss my dear sister exceedingly.\r\n\r\n    “For her I fully hope that she is safe, and happy, and I love to\r\n    think of her as without fears or doubts serving the Lord she so\r\n    humbly trusted—but we were so completely one that I scarcely\r\n    feel the same person without her. It was not only our sisterly\r\n    affection and colleagueship, but she had such a good judgment\r\n    that I am constantly longing for her sound sense to help me.\r\n    There is no use in idle grief, and I am fairly well again. I\r\n    have not at all put aside work through all my sorrow, for I felt\r\n    this would answer no good purpose, and now I am working on my\r\n    next Annual Report and am arranging to have a good portrait of\r\n    her as a frontispiece (plate XXVII.). I think she would like it,\r\n    and I am sure she would have been deeply grateful for the kind\r\n    respect paid by the good friends whose friendship she so\r\n    exceedingly valued. I scarcely know how to write about it—there\r\n    is so much I should like to say. Perhaps I had better not write\r\n    more, but indeed I value your beautiful words of comfort which I\r\n    have repeatedly read.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA touchingly sympathetic notice of the death appeared in Miss Ormerod’s\r\nAnnual Report for 1896.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod rose early, breakfasted at eight o’clock, and then read the\r\n“Times.” On getting to work she made a special point of replying to\r\ninquiries first, saying it served no good purpose to keep people waiting\r\nfor an answer; and, as a matter of fact, delay or hesitation found no\r\nplace in any of her actions. Frequently there were specimens to examine\r\nand report upon, and probably to put aside in a place of safety to\r\npermit of maturation or further development and to undergo subsequent\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nAfter the entomological work was finished—work which was a real\r\npleasure, but proved a severe strain as the Annual Report was taking\r\nform—her personal correspondence was attended to. She wrote with great\r\nfacility and with extraordinary rapidity and accuracy. She had many\r\ncolonial and continental correspondents who held standing invitations to\r\npay her visits, when in this country. Many came, and graciously she\r\nreceived them, and courteously and royally she entertained them with\r\nmuch pleasure to herself. None so honoured can ever forget the\r\ncordiality of the breezy welcome which, accompanied by her hearty and\r\ngenuinely natural and friendly laugh, were merely harbingers of the\r\nintellectual treat and the other good things that were in store for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAmong her most intimate immediate friends were Lord[42] and Lady\r\nGrimthorpe, the Bishop of St. Albans (Dr. Festing) and his sister, the\r\nDean (Walter John Lawrence, M.A.), General and Mrs. Bigge, Colonel and\r\nMiss Cartwright, Dr. and Mrs. Norman, and Dr. Lipscomb and Miss\r\nLipscomb. She was always pleased to see friends who called, and she was\r\nvery witty and cheerful with them. It was not at all necessary that they\r\nshould be scientific. One of the little group mentioned, simply and\r\nperhaps too modestly explains, “I always think that when Miss Ormerod\r\nsent for me, she descended to my level, and our conversation was\r\ngenerally on the most homely subjects. She would be most interested in\r\nthe little events of our everyday life and thoroughly enter into our\r\npleasures and enjoyments.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lively sense of humour which has already been mentioned as a family\r\ncharacteristic remained with her throughout life. The following little\r\nanecdote told by Mrs. Evans of Rowancroft, Dorking, is also illustrative\r\nof the personal coolness and power of action in times of difficulty\r\nwhich were conspicuous among Miss Ormerod’s attributes, and it shows\r\nalso “the quietly determined manner in which she did some things.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    “My poor little story was told to me a good many years ago. My\r\n    aunt was lunching with some friends, and the peace of the\r\n    entertainment was suddenly disturbed by the arrival of a large\r\n    and lively hornet. No one else ventured to interfere with the\r\n    enemy, but Miss Ormerod waited quietly till the insect came\r\n    close to her, caught it in her hand, and forthwith deposited it\r\n    in one of the little chip boxes which she generally carried in\r\n    her pockets. I leave you to imagine the astonishment and\r\n    admiration of the other guests, and the quiet chuckle with which\r\n    my aunt wound up her story with the remark, ‘Of course I knew it\r\n    was a “drone,” by the length of the antennæ.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod was not the least nervous in the sense of being afraid.\r\nWhen just a girl living at Sedbury she became the centre of admiration\r\nof the workmen on her father’s estate by fearlessly seizing a farmyard\r\ndog by the back of the neck and hauling him off her own dog, who had\r\nbeen rudely assaulted. Great was the applause of “Miss Eleanor’s\r\nsperrit.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXI.\r\n  AP ADAM OAK, SEDBURY PARK.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HEDGEHOG OAK, SEDBURY PARK.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother incident with a dog of a much more dangerous character is best\r\ngiven in her own words: “I only remember one instance of rabies. The\r\nanimal attacked was one of two beautiful Clumber spaniels which had been\r\nleft one day at our house with a message that the sender, a friend of my\r\nbrother, desired him to select one of them, and accept it as a gift. The\r\ntwo pretty creatures, named Cæsar and Pompey, were introduced into our\r\nestablishment, and one of them—Cæsar—became a great favourite with my\r\nfather. How long it was after their arrival I do not remember, but one\r\nday Cæsar vanished, and in the course of the afternoon, although he was\r\nnot one of the house dogs, he came to me as I was standing in the front\r\nhall. To my astonishment when I noticed him as usual, he gave a kind of\r\nscream, or extraordinary howl, such as I had never heard before, and I\r\nsaw that the expression of his eyes was wild and distressed to an\r\nentirely unnatural degree. The strange scream made me suspect what might\r\nbe wrong, and I called one of the head men. We took the dog, who was\r\nperfectly gentle, into the butler’s pantry and shut the door so that he\r\nmight not escape, whilst we tried to find out what was amiss. I did not\r\nmuch like the business, but it happened I was the only one at home,\r\nexcepting a lady relation, who, thinking “discretion the better part of\r\nvalour,” mounted herself _pro tem._ out of harm’s way, on the top of a\r\nvery large stone table, and awaited results in safety. I knew that\r\noffering water was a very partial test, but I had some poured out. The\r\neffect was instantaneous. The moment the poor dog heard the sound he\r\nalmost flew to me, as if for protection, and tried to wrap his head in\r\nmy dress so as to exclude the sound, calling out as if in great trouble.\r\nI had no right to have my father’s favourite dog destroyed on a\r\nsuspicion in his temporary absence, and the dog so far was not violent;\r\nit appeared to me that the only reasonable course to adopt was to have\r\nhim chained securely and led away to an empty stable, where he was\r\nfastened to a pole and the door shut. By this course no harm could\r\nhappen, except in prolonging the poor creature’s sufferings. These,\r\nhowever, though increasingly violent, were not endured for very long. By\r\nthe time my father returned, in about an hour, the dog was tearing the\r\nwoodwork all around him to pieces. He was at once destroyed, the attack\r\nbeing pronounced, by those better versed in the matter than myself,\r\nundoubtedly a case of rabies.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod’s brother, Dr. E. L. Ormerod, of Brighton, author of\r\n“British Social Wasps,” testified to the courage and skill with which\r\nshe assisted him in taking the hanging wasps’ nests from trees. The “Ap\r\nAdam” oak shown in plate XXI. which she climbed after a hornet’s nest by\r\nmeans of the library folding ladder, was one of the very ancient hollow\r\noaks in Sedbury Park, about one-third of a mile from the house. She had\r\na sick headache next day about which her brother John made the\r\nsympathetic (?) remark, “If young ladies will play at lamplighters they\r\nmust take the consequences!” The Hedgehog oak, at the root of which in\r\nplate XXI. Miss Ormerod is seen sitting in rather an uncomfortable\r\nposition, was another hollow remnant of the primeval forest. She had\r\nremarked that she thought she was sitting on a wasps’ nest when Waring,\r\nher second brother, promptly admonished her in the interests of the\r\nsafety of the party to “sit tight”! The two hollow shells of what must\r\nhave been at one time splendid timber trees, were historically\r\ninteresting, having been boundary marks of the country referred to in\r\nthe time of Edward III. Both trees have been cleared away and the\r\nancient oak now known as that of “Ap Adam” stands only a few hundred\r\nyards from the original tree, within the moat which formerly surrounded\r\nold Badam’s Court. There are several other very ancient oaks in the\r\npark. Two on the left of the carriage drive, going in the direction of\r\nthe mansion house, were christened “Darby and Joan” by Miss Ormerod.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the eldest sister, Mary, had the misfortune to run a\r\ncrochet hook through her hand. The mother fainted away. Miss G. S.\r\nOrmerod, who supplied this information, concludes, “My Aunt Eleanor\r\nfetched her forceps, nipped off the hook and drew out the stem without\r\nwaiting for the doctor’s arrival, showing not only her courage but her\r\npresence of mind.” The same authority goes on to say:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “She was very fond of children and young people. When staying at\r\n    Sedbury, we always enjoyed our walks with her. She made\r\n    everything interesting. She taught me a great deal about\r\n    insects, helped me to begin a collection of butterflies, &c.,\r\n    showing me how to destroy them mercifully and how to set them\r\n    out properly. I remember stuffing a splendid dragon-fly under\r\n    her superintendence.\r\n\r\n    “Fully occupied as her life was up to the time of her last\r\n    illness, yet she was always full of sympathy and interest for\r\n    her poorer neighbours, always ready to assist in any good work\r\n    that came before her.\r\n\r\n    “You may like to hear how my aunt was beloved by the servants\r\n    for her practical kindness and for the keen interest she took in\r\n    all outdoor surroundings. Any curiosity discovered by them,\r\n    whether animal or vegetable, was always carefully brought in for\r\n    her inspection. Many were the snakes, birds, nests, insects,\r\n    fungi, &c., handed to her, especially at the time when she did\r\n    so much modelling.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShe maintained throughout a practical interest in the survivors of her\r\nmother’s old servants, and she extended her kindness and thoughtfulness\r\nto those of her own household. Her strong loyalty was curiously\r\ninstanced on one of these occasions, on the King’s accession to the\r\nthrone, when she summoned all her household, including outdoor servants,\r\nand produced some rare old white port in which they drank the King’s\r\nhealth. She subscribed liberally to St. Albans’ charities and other\r\npublic objects in the Abbey parish in which she lived, as well as in St.\r\nMichael’s, where she attended church. Dr. Lipscomb gives, in a few\r\nwords, “An instance of her great generosity, so well known to all who\r\nwere intimate with her, though she ever did such deeds by stealth and\r\nblushed to find them fame.” He goes on: “I may mention a day she asked\r\nme to see her. Being rather late I apologised, telling her that the\r\nannual meeting of the governors of our local hospital detained me. She\r\nsaid she hoped we had had a successful meeting, and on my saying ‘Yes,\r\nwith the exception that the accounts showed a deficit of some thirty odd\r\npounds,’ she immediately produced her cheque book and gave me a cheque\r\nfor the amount.” She also extended personal sympathy and practical help\r\nto many of her poor neighbours by whom she was loved and esteemed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe never lost taste for the pastime of modelling in plaster of Paris,\r\nand at leisure moments, when unable to go out of doors, she would occupy\r\nspare time in this way. She modelled some beautiful specimens of common\r\nfruits and made the cast of her own hand. In the evening, when tired of\r\nwriting, she would read or crochet. Her great skill in what is generally\r\nregarded as exclusively woman’s work is independently testified to by\r\nMiss Emma Swan, niece of Professor Westwood, who is so well able to\r\nspeak with authority, in the following words: “What particularly struck\r\nme as a young girl at the time I visited her was the very beautiful\r\nneedlework she found time to do, and pleasure in doing. Whatever she\r\ndid, she seemed to do well!” From the same source we learn that “she\r\nsang and played the piano very well indeed.” She also composed music\r\nwith facility and might have developed musical tastes, but for the\r\noverpowering love of science which was the absorbing interest of her\r\nlife.[43]\r\n\r\nWe have it on excellent authority that the very greatest pleasure of all\r\nher public recognitions was experienced on April 14, 1900, in the McEwan\r\nHall, Edinburgh, when the LL.D. of the University was conferred upon her\r\nin company with a group of distinguished recipients of that honour[44]\r\nbefore an assemblage of about 3,000 people. The trials of the occasion,\r\nwhich are described in her letters, were greatly lessened by the\r\ncourtesy and kindness and whispered words of encouragement of his\r\nExcellency, the American Ambassador, who was placed beside her during\r\nthe ceremonial, and preceded her in undergoing the ordeal of capping. In\r\npresenting her to the Vice-Chancellor (Principal Sir Wm. Muir) the Dean\r\nof the Faculty of Law (Sir Ludovic Grant) said, with his usual\r\neloquence:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “A duty now devolves upon you, sir, which has devolved upon none\r\n    of your predecessors, and of which the performance will render\r\n    the present occasion memorable in the annals of the University.\r\n    Our roll of Hon. Graduates in Law contains the names of many\r\n    illustrious men, but you will search it in vain for the name of\r\n    a woman. To-day, however, a new roll is to be opened—a roll of\r\n    illustrious women; and it is matter for congratulation that this\r\n    roll should begin with a name so honoured as that of Miss\r\n    Ormerod.\r\n\r\n    “The pre-eminent position which Miss Ormerod holds in the world\r\n    of science is the reward of patient study and unwearying\r\n    observation. Her investigations have been chiefly directed\r\n    towards the discovery of methods for the prevention of the\r\n    ravages of those insects which are injurious to orchard, field,\r\n    and forest. Her labours have been crowned with such success,\r\n    that she is entitled to be hailed as the protectress of\r\n    agriculture and the fruits of the earth—a beneficent Demeter of\r\n    the nineteenth century. It would take long to enumerate her\r\n    contributions to Entomological and Phenological literature, but\r\n    I may select for mention the valuable series of reports\r\n    extending over twenty years, the preparation of which involved\r\n    correspondence with all parts of the world. Remarkable, too, is\r\n    the list of the honours which she has received. She was the\r\n    first lady to be admitted a Fellow of the Royal Meteorological\r\n    Society, and she has been awarded the Silver Medal of the\r\n    ‘Société Nationale d’Acclimatation’ of France. To these\r\n    distinctions the University of Edinburgh, sensible of her\r\n    conspicuous services, and not unmindful of her generous\r\n    benefactions, now adds its Doctorate in Laws.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe honour referred to, conferred by our cultured neighbours across the\r\nchannel, was publicly announced in the press in the following words:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “At the Annual Meeting on the 25th of June, 1891, of the Société\r\n    Nationale d’Acclimatation de France, M. Le Myre de Vilers,\r\n    president, in the chair, the large silver medal of the Society,\r\n    bearing the portrait of Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire, was decreed to\r\n    Miss Eleanor A. Ormerod, of St. Albans, England, for her work in\r\n    Economic or Applied Entomology.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a confidential correspondent she wrote, “You will believe that this\r\npleases me very much.”\r\n\r\nPlate XXII. shows this medal with three other silver and two gold medals\r\nthat were presented to Miss Ormerod between the years 1870 and 1900 by\r\nhome and foreign institutions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod preserved very few letters except those necessary for\r\nscientific or business purposes, and these she classified and fastened\r\ninto books for convenience of reference. Nothing else, and especially\r\nnothing which if returned to the writer, would hereafter lead to\r\nunpleasantness, escaped ordeal of fire. After keeping letters on general\r\nsubjects for a few days, she would tear them up. The result is that, of\r\nthe mass of interesting contributions on many subjects, which poured in\r\nto the oracle, first of Isleworth and latterly of St. Albans, from all\r\nsorts and conditions of men and women, the few sample letters written by\r\nprominent public men and reproduced in these pages, are almost all that\r\nremain. To some of her relatives she wrote very amusing letters, but—no\r\ndoubt inspired by the desire to avoid all possible danger of hurting the\r\nfeelings of people referred to—she exacted the promise that they should\r\nnot be preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    KEY TO MEDALS PRESENTED TO MISS ORMEROD AND SHOWN ON PLATE xxii.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Royal Horticultural Society,\r\n    Victoria Medal of Honour,\r\n    1900.\r\n    (Gold Medal.)\r\n\r\n    Royal Horticultural Society.\r\n    For Collection of Economic\r\n    Entomology.\r\n    1870.\r\n    (Silver Medal.)\r\n\r\n    Société Nationale d’Acclimatation\r\n    de France.\r\n    Entomologie Appliquée.\r\n    1899.\r\n    (Silver Medal.)\r\n\r\n    University of Moscow, 1872\r\n    Emperor Peter I., 30th May,\r\n    1672.\r\n    Emperor Alexander II., 30th May,\r\n    1872.\r\n    (Gold Medal.)\r\n\r\n    International Health Exhibition,\r\n    London, 1884.\r\n    (Silver Medal.)\r\n\r\n    Moscow Polytechnic Exhibition,\r\n    1872.\r\n    (Silver Medal.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXII.\r\n  MISS ORMEROD’S MEDALS, RECEIVED BETWEEN 1870 AND 1900, AS RECOGNITION\r\n    BY SCIENTIFIC BODIES OF HER SCIENTIFIC WORK.\r\n  (_pp. 96, 304._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n          LETTERS TO COLONEL COUSSMAKER AND MR.

Apart from the\r\nEntomology discussed, the letters show how ready she was to recognise\r\nand to commend the meritorious scientific work of others.\r\n\r\n           _To Colonel Coussmaker, Westwood, near Guildford._\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DUNSTER LODGE, SPRING GROVE, ISLEWORTH,\r\n                                                   _August 1, 1885_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,—Perhaps the best way I can reply to your inquiry about\r\n    the coloured sheets is to enclose the short description, on the\r\n    wrapper of one of my reports.[45]\r\n\r\n    I should mention, though, that they are the property of the\r\n    Royal Agricultural Society; I only drew them. The insects are\r\n    drawn greatly magnified, with a view to hanging the sheets on\r\n    walls of schools. The history, and the simplest means of\r\n    prevention are given in the very plainest words I could find.\r\n\r\n    Have you my current report? It contains a good deal on that\r\n    great pest the Ox warble fly (fig. 5)—contributed by practical\r\n    men—cattle owners, veterinary observers and the like. I would,\r\n    with the greatest pleasure, ask your acceptance of a copy if you\r\n    would permit me to do so. If you have studied its habits in\r\n    India, I should greatly like to be in communication with you on\r\n    the subject. The Colonial Company procured me a few estimates of\r\n    damage to hides—which were of much service as showing\r\n    comparative amount of injury in different parts of the globe,\r\n    but I much want to find whether in India the larva is found to\r\n    penetrate below the subcutaneous tissue into the flesh. I am\r\n    aware from one of my contributors connected with inspecting army\r\n    supplies in India, that at one time meat for the troops was apt\r\n    to be so damaged from what he considered to be this attack, that\r\n    it was to some extent useless. The locality was not far from\r\n    Kurrachee. If you, as a student of insect life, could give me\r\n    any information on this point, I should be thankful for the\r\n    addition to the notes I am still collecting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 4, 1885._\r\n\r\n    Many thanks to you for so kindly taking the trouble to write\r\n    about the injury to flesh possibly caused by the Warble maggot;\r\n    it would be of great service to know about it. Doubtless your\r\n    care of your cattle had a great deal to do with their being free\r\n    from injury—if we could but get even the moderate amount of care\r\n    applied which is needed to put on a dressing when attack is seen\r\n    it would make an enormous difference.\r\n\r\n    The Dart or Turnip moth caterpillar is doing damage now—and I do\r\n    not believe there is a better remedy than scraping out the\r\n    grubs, but this is very troublesome till they are larger. I see\r\n    in a report on the “Cutworms,” as they call these creatures in\r\n    the U.S.A., that there is very much less injury from them on\r\n    ground which has been well salted. It is thought that the salt\r\n    drawn up into the plant makes it distasteful to the\r\n    caterpillars. I do not know how this may be, but in a district\r\n    of the Eastern Counties reported from last year—where previously\r\n    they had been quite set against anything “artificial”—they were\r\n    finding the turnips on salted lands answered very much the best.\r\n    I should much like to try the effect of watering with salt and\r\n    water, at a safe strength, but from my own garden being so\r\n    perpetually used for trial ground it is getting free of regular\r\n    pests. I have found watering with soft soap and a little mineral\r\n    oil (pp. 66-67, eighth report, 1884), act well on these\r\n    caterpillars. The application appeared to paralyse the creature\r\n    so that it could not get away from the poisonous effects of the\r\n    mixture, which is a very important point.\r\n\r\n    I found this mixture act well on Cabbage green fly, and if you\r\n    should try it I shall be very much obliged for any observation.\r\n    The great point is to mix the ingredients at boiling heat. I\r\n    would try whether the strength noted was safe for any special\r\n    plant. I rather think it is for cabbage, but certainly not for\r\n    young leafage of roses. I shall be very glad if I can be of any\r\n    help in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) 1, Turnip moth; 2, caterpillar.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (_b_) 1, Heart-and-dart moth; 2, caterpillar; 3, chrysalis in\r\n    earth-cell.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—SURFACE CATERPILLARS: OF THE TURNIP OR DART MOTH, _AGROTIS\r\n    SEGETUM_, OCHSENHEIMER, AND OF THE HEART-AND-DART MOTH,\r\n  _AGROTIS EXCLAMATIONIS_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST.

I shall hope to\r\n    add some of it to my Turnip Caterpillars paper, which is not yet\r\n    gone to press. Thank you for the offer of the specimens, but I\r\n    do not quite see my way to showing live ones yet. My lecture [at\r\n    the London Farmers’ Club] is a terribly anxious prospect to\r\n    myself, but I can but do my best, and I am endeavouring with the\r\n    utmost care to form something that may be acceptable, but I am\r\n    sure you will believe me that to address such a skilled audience\r\n    is rather anxious work. I should much like to lay before the\r\n    members of the Club some ideas for their consideration as to how\r\n    some reasonable amount of plain serviceable information might be\r\n    got abroad. I do not believe in all this lecturing, examining\r\n    and talking of classification. To my thinking it is beginning at\r\n    the wrong end, and that the learners need first to make sure of\r\n    their facts in the field and classify them when they have got\r\n    them, if they do it at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Female, head of male, and caterpillar.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—WOOD LEOPARD MOTH, _ZEUZERA ÆSCULI_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 17, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I have examined your caterpillars carefully, and I find that of\r\n    the oak stem to correspond exactly with the larva of the Wood\r\n    leopard moth, the _Zeuzera æsculi_. This is commonly found in\r\n    (or at least it is usually sent me from) wood of fruit trees,\r\n    but it attacks oak as well as forest trees of various kinds.\r\n    Your specimen has also one of the characteristic habits of\r\n    ejecting brown fluid from its mouth on disturbance. I think you\r\n    have my “Manual,” and there you would find a figure of the moth\r\n    and larva. Your specimen is rather full coloured, but they vary\r\n    greatly in this respect.\r\n\r\n    Your other caterpillar is a Lepidopterous larva, but I cannot\r\n    name it with certainty. It is quite possible that it is the\r\n    larva of the “Hornet Clearwing,” the _Trochilium_ (= _Sesia_)\r\n    _bembeciforme_, but I have never seen a specimen, although the\r\n    attack is said to be common, especially to _Salix caprea_. The\r\n    attack is stated to be mostly in the lower part of the stem. I\r\n    think that you very likely have Loudon’s “Arboretum” in your\r\n    library, and if so you would find some good notes and fair\r\n    figures of the hornet-like moth and its larva and pupa _in situ_\r\n    in the wood at pp. 1481 and 1482, vol. iii. The larva is nearly\r\n    dead now, so that the form is altered, but I do not see any\r\n    reason against it being this kind; still I cannot say it is.\r\n\r\n    I have a very curious report of much damage attributed to Puss\r\n    moth caterpillars at a locality in Lincolnshire, and am waiting\r\n    with much interest for specimens to see what the cause can be. I\r\n    rather expect it will be rabbits!\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

Sheep-farmers are threatened with another plague.\r\n    The ‘hill-grub’ has often done considerable damage to the upland\r\n    grass-lands, notably in the years from 1830 to 1835. Just now\r\n    complaints are rife from farms in many parts of the wide\r\n    districts ravaged by the Voles[47] (in 1891-92-93). As usual the\r\n    farmers look on these ‘hill-grubs’ as very sudden arrivals, but\r\n    this is not the case, for last autumn the moths which these\r\n    larvæ produce were in extraordinary swarms, and far in advance\r\n    of their normal numbers. I remember noting at the end of last\r\n    September when coming down from the neighbourhood of Loch\r\n    Dungeon one evening in the twilight, how unusually abundant the\r\n    Antler moths were flying. The evening was mild and very moist,\r\n    and just as we got on to the level ground at the outside of a\r\n    moss of perhaps six acres in extent, we found Antler moths\r\n    flying in countless myriads in every direction. The time was\r\n    6.40, and there was still enough of the gloaming left to see the\r\n    moths quite distinctly on every side, flying just below the\r\n    level of the grass-seed heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “On August 23rd I happened to be going across the farm of\r\n    Townhead, in Closeburn parish, Dumfriesshire, and about 10.10\r\n    a.m. the Antler moths appeared in myriads. Thousands upon\r\n    thousands of them were flying in all directions, most of them\r\n    just amongst and over the flowering heads of the spret, _Juncus\r\n    articulatus_; but many were flying higher in the air, and some\r\n    mounted up out of sight. It was a wonderful scene, and one that\r\n    I would not have cared to miss. The effect was altogether\r\n    different to that presented by the evening flight I saw near\r\n    Loch Dungeon in the previous autumn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—ANTLER OR GRASS MOTH, _CHARÆAS GRAMINIS_,\r\n  AND CATERPILLARS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n    “A party of gentlemen fishing from near the Holm of Dalquhairn\r\n    for some five or six miles down the Ken found all the trout they\r\n    caught perfectly crammed with these ‘hill-grub’ caterpillars.\r\n    Old shepherds will tell of times when they were so numerous that\r\n    after sudden thundershowers the sheep-drains have been\r\n    completely dammed up with their bodies. The moth deposits its\r\n    eggs, which produce larvæ that descend to and feed mostly about\r\n    the roots of grasses during the autumn and early winter. After\r\n    hybernation they commence in March and April to feed again with\r\n    redoubled energy, and they turn to pupæ at the end of June and\r\n    during July, producing the moths again in a few weeks (the\r\n    perfect insect flies during August and September). Thus their\r\n    cycle of existence in these various stages extends the whole\r\n    year round. Their worst natural enemy is the common rook at the\r\n    season when these birds betake themselves and their young broods\r\n    to the hills, and I have reason to believe that many other birds\r\n    devour them. The blackheaded gull, _Larus ridibundus_, and the\r\n    common gull, _L. canus_, are very fond of the larvæ. Curlews\r\n    take a good many, golden plovers and lapwings pick them up in\r\n    numbers. Cuckoos also feed upon them, and I have found the\r\n    stomachs of snow buntings, shot on the hills at midwinter,\r\n    filled with these grubs” (R.

The bronze colour is divided lengthwise\r\n    by three pale lines, the back and side stripes meeting or almost\r\n    meeting above the tail, and another narrower pale stripe or line\r\n    runs lower down along each side.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n           _To Robert Service, Esq., Maxwelltown, Dumfries._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                                   _August 1, 1894._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,—It is many years since you gave me any of your good\r\n    observations, but indeed I would gladly have profited by them,\r\n    and it was only lately that I knew you were continuing them.\r\n    Perhaps Mr. Bailey, the editor,[48] may have mentioned to you\r\n    that I was so struck with the paper which he sent me, in which\r\n    you mention _C. graminis_, that interpreting the _nom de plume_\r\n    (“Mabie Moss”) literally, I wrote to him expressing my\r\n    admiration and asking if I might be put in communication with\r\n    the writer; and now may I prefer the request to yourself that,\r\n    if you please, you will kindly tell me anything you are inclined\r\n    to favour me with about this recent outbreak of the _C.\r\n    graminis_. Would it not be of great interest if we could make\r\n    out something more about the parasites? There are, firstly, the\r\n    threadworms—_Mermis_. Do you chance to have identified them? I\r\n    have got no further than the specialist to whom I sent\r\n    specimens, thinking they were most likely _Mermis albicans_—but\r\n    this he was going to investigate. Then there is the bacterian\r\n    infestation—the “flacherie,”[49] as they call it in silk-worms.\r\n    This seems to me of great practical interest; and, thirdly, the\r\n    larval parasitism of the _C. graminis_ larvæ. I had so\r\n    exceedingly few specimens that I could not work up the matter,\r\n    but, whilst one cocoon sent to me appeared to be that of an\r\n    Ichneumon, the only large larva which I found certainly in many\r\n    respects resembled that of a _Tachina_ fly. I should greatly\r\n    like, if agreeable to yourself, to hear from you again on\r\n    entomological matters. Besides the pleasure, it is a great\r\n    advantage to me to have contributions of skilled and experienced\r\n    information, and I would indeed most scrupulously acknowledge to\r\n    whom I was indebted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 3, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I am much obliged to you for taking the trouble to send the\r\n    morsels of _C. graminis_ caterpillars. As you say, I am afraid\r\n    we could hardly get results from them, but still with bacteria\r\n    presence I do not know but dried bits may show something when\r\n    moistened, so I am keeping them for the present. That enormous\r\n    appearance of the imagos must have been a wonderful sight; I\r\n    should have liked to see it—and what (I wonder) will be the\r\n    result?\r\n\r\n    Pretty surely I suppose there will be egg-laying and a\r\n    consequent presence of larvæ? But if your convenience allowed\r\n    you to inspect say two months hence, would it not be very\r\n    interesting to ascertain—absolutely make sure—whether there is a\r\n    presence of the “hill-grubs” or whether the parasitism of their\r\n    parents has been transmitted, to the weakening or destruction of\r\n    their descendants? If we found no grubs, nor grubs with\r\n    “flacherie” present, what a very interesting discovery this\r\n    would be!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 14, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I am writing a few lines at once on receipt of your letter,\r\n    first to thank you for your geographical note, which helps me\r\n    very much. [These attacks of “hill-grubs” were more or less\r\n    general over the hill country of Kirkcudbrightshire and over the\r\n    adjacent sheep-farms in Ayrshire, the Dumfriesshire hills, and\r\n    the contiguous sheep-farm districts in Lanarkshire, Peebles,\r\n    Selkirk, and Roxburgh. Seven counties were affected to my\r\n    knowledge. R.S.] What a widespread outburst this has been! But I\r\n    also write to beg you not to suppose for one minute that I see\r\n    any reason to doubt what we have had laid down for such a length\r\n    of time about date of hatching of larvæ of _C. graminis_. Mr.\r\n    Wm. Buckler[50] “lumped” his observations of this and two other\r\n    species, and it seems to me that what happened to caterpillars,\r\n    which I gather he observed in captivity, in no way militates\r\n    against correctness of other people’s out-of-door observations.\r\n\r\n    With many thanks for all the information you give me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 20, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged to you for the very interesting note you\r\n    have let me have about these dipterous parasites[51] of the _C.\r\n    graminis_. How fortunate you have been to secure them, and in\r\n    such good order too! As you have been kind enough to give me two\r\n    of your specimens, I think I will presently send one of them to\r\n    Mr. Meade, of Bradford. I am sure he would value it very much,\r\n    and would doubtless identify it, which would be a help to me,\r\n    for as you know I do not like to rest without verification on my\r\n    own dipterous identifications. You would not mind about this\r\n    part, as doubtless if you have not yourself identified, Mr.\r\n    Percy H. Grimshaw, Museum of Science and Art, Edinburgh, would\r\n    see to it (pp. 149, 185).\r\n\r\n    Do you ever come across the so-called “Turnip Mud-beetle,”\r\n    _Helophorus rugosus_, in your country? I had the beetle some\r\n    years ago, as doing harm to turnip leafage, but we could not\r\n    find the larva. Lately we found a larva doing a deal of mischief\r\n    in the same neighbourhood by burrowing galleries in the top of\r\n    turnips, and it struck me we might have what we wanted to\r\n    complete the history. So I sent it to Canon Fowler, and he\r\n    identified as beyond doubt _Helophorus_ and being found where\r\n    _H. r._ resorts, it is hardly open to doubt that we have got\r\n    parent and child. Please excuse a short letter, for I am working\r\n    as hard as I can manage.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

Bailey, Esq., Aldersey, Grammar School, Bunbury, Tarporley,\r\n                               Cheshire._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST.

BAILEY,—I am very much obliged to you indeed for kindly\r\n    letting me see the documents which I now return, after most\r\n    careful perusal, with many thanks. It is indeed satisfactory\r\n    that the good work of our boys (destroying warbles), should have\r\n    given such valuable help in this matter, which is so important\r\n    to all who have to do with cattle, and consequently to the\r\n    nation. The approval of His Grace the Duke of Westminster (so\r\n    kindly given, too) will add great weight, and I am heartily glad\r\n    also to see the Hon. Cecil Parker’s confirmation from personal\r\n    experiment and knowledge of the soundness of the plan and its\r\n    success. I think if I can get time that I will write to him, to\r\n    mention how strongly the many letters which I have received this\r\n    year confirm the good effects of removal of the maggots (2 of\r\n    fig. 5, and fig. 7), and likewise the prevention (in almost\r\n    every case mentioned) of summer disturbance of the cattle.\r\n\r\n    I thought you would not object to my keeping a copy of your\r\n    letter to his Grace.\r\n\r\n    The Committee of the “London Farmers’ Club” which I daresay you\r\n    know more about than I do, but which I believe to be the great\r\n    Farmers’ Club of England, has sent me an urgent request to read\r\n    them a paper on Injurious Insects, at their meeting place, the\r\n    Salisbury Square Hotel, London, in next April. Professor Herbert\r\n    Little, one of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society,\r\n    brought me the message, and at first I felt fairly frightened at\r\n    the idea, and tried to “make excuse,” for it is a somewhat\r\n    anxious prospect (in the words of old John Knox) for a\r\n    gentlewoman to look in the face of so many “bearded men and not\r\n    be over much afraid,” but I got such serious remonstrance,\r\n    almost rebuke, from various quarters that I have consented to\r\n    endeavour to prepare as good a paper as I can, and read it\r\n    myself. Now if you permit me—I think that in the portion about\r\n    warbles it would be very useful (and much more telling than any\r\n    words of my own) to give your terse, clear and attractively\r\n    worded account of what really has happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Egg; 2, maggot; 3 and 4, chrysalis-case; 5 and 6, fly. 3 and 5,\r\n    natural size, after Bracy Clark; the other figures after Brauer, and\r\n    all magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.—OX WARBLE FLY, OR BOT FLY, _HYPODERMA BOVIS_, DE GEER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—PIECE OF YEARLING SKIN WITH 402 WARBLE-HOLES.\r\n  (_Greatly reduced by photography._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following extract is the chief part of the letter by Mr. Bailey to\r\nthe Duke of Westminster (October 28, 1887):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    MY LORD DUKE,—I was very thankful to see by last Saturday’s\r\n    Chester _Chronicle_, that at the Chester Dairy Show you drew the\r\n    attention of our farmers to the enormous loss caused by the\r\n    presence of ox warbles in our cattle. During the past three\r\n    years, I have been directing the notice of my pupils to the\r\n    mischief done by these warbles, and, as we have now nearly\r\n    stamped out this pest in Bunbury Parish, it has occurred to me\r\n    that your Grace might be interested in learning the course which\r\n    we have taken, and also in seeing how very easily our farmers\r\n    might get rid of this enemy. The great majority of the boys in\r\n    this school are either sons of farmers, or of farm labourers.\r\n    After the boys had received from me a short lesson on the Warble\r\n    fly, they were asked to examine their cattle at home, and to\r\n    bring to school as many specimens as they could collect of the\r\n    maggots of this fly. Hundreds were squeezed out and brought in\r\n    the course of a few days. One boy alone destroyed 230 of these\r\n    warble grubs in the spring of 1885 by the application of common\r\n    cart grease and sulphur to the spiracle in the black tipped tail\r\n    of the maggot or by squeezing out the maggots. [_Vide_ Miss\r\n    Ormerod’s ninth Annual Report on Injurious Insects and Common\r\n    Farm Pests, p. 92.] Last Easter I desired my pupils, during the\r\n    week’s holiday, to examine carefully the live stock at home for\r\n    ox warble and to report to me. I enclose a copy of the first\r\n    list which I received, and I am sure it will satisfy your Grace\r\n    that this pest may easily be stamped out, if our farmers, their\r\n    sons, or their labourers would apply the smear, or press out the\r\n    maggots and destroy them. School boys can do this work, and feel\r\n    a pleasure in the task. What has been accomplished by Bunbury\r\n    boys can be equally well done by the boys of any other village\r\n    school.[52]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.—PIECE OF UNDER SIDE OF WARBLED HIDE; WARBLES ABOUT\r\n  HALF SIZE.\r\n  _From a Photo by Messrs.

One-half the fat\r\nbeasts killed in this country are afflicted with this grub. The farmer\r\nloses on his stock from poorer condition, and from death; from less\r\nyield of milk, and damage to all, especially to fattening beasts, and\r\ncows from their tearing full gallop about the fields, besides loss to\r\nthe butcher of from a halfpenny to a penny per pound on warbled hides.\r\nLook at the under side of the newly flayed hide of a warbled beast and\r\nsee the grub cells (fig. 7). Maggots may be squeezed out, or easily\r\nkilled by putting a dab of cart grease and sulphur, McDougall’s Smear,\r\nor anything that will choke them in the opening of the warble, and the\r\nfly may be prevented from striking by dressing the beasts’ backs in\r\nsummer.]\r\n\r\nMay I add that during the past five years I have been drawing the\r\nattention of the boys to insects, which are injurious to food crops.\r\nThey are quite familiar with such pests as the leather jacket, wireworm,\r\nturnip and mangold fly, caterpillars of the magpie moth, and the\r\ngooseberry and currant sawfly, &c., &c., for hundreds of living\r\nspecimens have been brought to the school, bird’s-nesting having to a\r\nvery great extent been superseded by this new pursuit. The boys, having\r\nbecome well acquainted with the pests, were instructed as to the best\r\nmethods of prevention and remedy. These boys will, in the course of a\r\nvery few years, be the farmers and farm labourers of this district, and\r\nI am satisfied that even the little instruction which I am able to give\r\nthem in what I may call “Practical Entomology” will then be found to be\r\nof considerable use to them.—W.

BAILEY,—The Farmers’ Club meeting will be an\r\n    exceptionally rare opportunity of pushing forward this, and some\r\n    other important matters, as well as of laying before some of our\r\n    leading agriculturists some important facts about a few of the\r\n    pests of the corn crops of last season’s notoriety. You will\r\n    think my letter endless, but I want to congratulate you most\r\n    heartily on your good success in the examinations (which must be\r\n    a weary work to prepare for), and also on that of your assistant\r\n    master and teacher, which is indeed encouraging, and to say how\r\n    sorry we are to hear of your illness. I trust, if it please God,\r\n    that you may have comfortable health again—it makes such a\r\n    difference.\r\n\r\n    Since my sister and I came to St. Albans we are almost like\r\n    different people. We have a beautiful house (plate XIX.) with\r\n    such thick walls that we do not feel the changes of temperature,\r\n    and a lovely country view along the valley. We have also met\r\n    with a most kindly reception, and, last but not least amongst\r\n    blessings and comforts for which we are deeply grateful, is that\r\n    educated earnest clergy form a decided element in the Society.\r\n    But now I ought only to add thanks and very kind regards from us\r\n    both.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 11, 1887._\r\n\r\n    I must tell you the pleasure with which I heard your letter to\r\n    the Duke of Westminster read at the “Seeds and Plants Diseases”\r\n    Committee of the Royal Agricultural Society on Tuesday, and\r\n    recommended for report to the Council, and I am glad to see it\r\n    on the Society’s report sheet sent me this morning, as being\r\n    recommended for publication. I think this will do a great deal\r\n    of good, and it cannot, I think, fail to be a great satisfaction\r\n    to yourself that the excellent work done under your guidance and\r\n    direction should thus be of such extended service throughout the\r\n    land. I also figure to myself how pleased the good lads will be!\r\n\r\n    Will you accept the enclosed photo of my new and most\r\n    comfortable home (plate XIX.); it gives a good idea of it,\r\n    excepting in not quite showing the very rapid slope down from\r\n    the terrace flower beds.\r\n\r\n    It would be a great and very true pleasure if when you can spare\r\n    time you would look in on us here for a couple of nights; I am\r\n    sure that with our old Abbey and the many things of interest\r\n    here, and some chat which you would let us have between whiles,\r\n    the time would not lag. There are both pleasure and benefit in\r\n    the work you allow me a part in. Pray believe me always, with\r\n    kind regards and good wishes from us both.\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On the warble question Miss Ormerod wrote on April 22, 1899, to Dr.\r\nFletcher[55]:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Just now I am working hard on Warble affairs. The butchers\r\n    (that is, leading men among them) very much wish that what is\r\n    called ‘licked’ beef should be inquired into. I do not know\r\n    whether you are troubled by this in Canada, but it is an\r\n    alteration that takes place on the outside of the carcass of the\r\n    animal beneath a badly warbled part of the hide. This part\r\n    becomes soft and wet and blackish, and is popularly supposed to\r\n    be soaked with moisture from the unlucky animal licking itself\r\n    to soothe the irritation. Really it is the result of the chronic\r\n    inflammation of the badly warbled hide. This causes much loss to\r\n    butchers, and if I can get it well brought forward I think we\r\n    shall through this rouse the farmers to better attention. The\r\n    authorities at our Royal Veterinary College are most kindly\r\n    helping me, and I hope before long to have enough sound\r\n    information to be able to publish a paper on it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Medd[56] Miss Ormerod also wrote in Nov., 1900:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Do you chance to have noticed that the Warble fly of the United\r\n    States, the _Hypoderma lineata_, is considered to be quite a\r\n    distinct species to our _H. bovis_? I believe that investigation\r\n    has proved that our bovis is very rarely found in the U.S.A.,\r\n    just as their _lineata_ is very rarely, indeed, found here.\r\n    Practically (that is, so far as injury to the hide is\r\n    concerned), the trouble is similar, both in method of operation\r\n    and in the frightful amount of damage caused; but it has been\r\n    laid down by good U.S.A. authorities that in the case of their\r\n    Warble fly, _lineata_, the attack is commenced by the quite\r\n    embryo maggots making their way by the mouth to the gullet and\r\n    there hanging on until it pleases them to make their way onward,\r\n    by piercing through the coat of the œsophagus and onward through\r\n    the tissues of the beast until they arrive after their long and\r\n    curious journey beneath the ribs, whence they proceed to work\r\n    beneath the hide like ours. The matter seems to me very curious,\r\n    but I was not called on to enter into discussion, excepting\r\n    giving my reasons why I felt wholly certain, and considered the\r\n    evidence in our hands proved, that our _H. bovis_ did not start\r\n    on its travels in this way.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Male; 2, curved extremity of abdomen of female; 3, maggot; 4, mouth\r\n    hooks; 5, spiracles at extremity of tail of maggot—all greatly\r\n    magnified (after Brauer).\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n      Eggs attached to hairs        Maggots or horse bots attached\r\n      from a horse’s fore-leg       to the membrane of stomach\r\n      magnified and natural         (After Bracy Clark.)\r\n      size.

I have\r\n    explained that Gad flies, _Tabanidæ_, may be distinguished by\r\n    being blood suckers, and by their maggots feeding in the ground,\r\n    and that ‘Bot’ or ‘Warble’ are only two convertible names for\r\n    _Œstridæ_, but that ‘Bot’ is usually most specially applied to\r\n    internal feeding maggots, and Warble to those that live in the\r\n    hide, notably in Warbles. But such difficulty continues to arise\r\n    from haphazard use of the words, I have suggested that if\r\n    possible the scientific name—(_Gastrophilus equi_) should be\r\n    insisted on. An entomologist (?) had absolutely called this\r\n    attack or kind of attack inside a horse that of ‘Gad fly’! But\r\n    as the attack has been well studied in the Department of\r\n    Agriculture, Cape Town, I have suggested they should communicate\r\n    with the Government entomologist, Mr. C. Lownsbury. For their\r\n    practical needs, I have suggested clearing the Horse botfly, _G.\r\n    equi_, eggs from the hair by dressing, and very especially that\r\n    they should take care all droppings (in which the maggots pass\r\n    from the horse, and where, or in the ground beneath, they go\r\n    through their changes to the perfect state) should be so treated\r\n    as to kill the maggots. It may possibly turn out that the\r\n    _Gastrophilus_ may be some other species than _equi_—I have not\r\n    had specimens. When you are about to devote so much attention to\r\n    Colonial Agriculture [in the “Garton” course of Colonial and\r\n    Indian Lectures], I wished very much to tell you what I am\r\n    about, lest I should, as this is sent me officially, go on other\r\n    lines than you approve.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _June 9, 1891._[57]\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. BAILEY,—I have now much pleasure in asking permission\r\n    once again to place in your hands a cheque for £5 5s., to be\r\n    used exactly as you may judge fit, in purchase of prizes for the\r\n    encouragement of serviceable study of habits and means of\r\n    prevention of ravages of injurious insects by your scholars. I\r\n    have real pleasure in doing this because I believe the\r\n    importance of those who are in any way connected with\r\n    agriculture being serviceably acquainted with the causes of loss\r\n    to crop or stock, and means whereby this may be lessened, cannot\r\n    be over-estimated. I offer my hearty congratulations to yourself\r\n    and your pupils on the satisfactory work achieved in my own\r\n    department of agricultural entomology in one more year.\r\n\r\n    I do not like to offer views of my own on these matters now that\r\n    what is called Technical Instruction is receiving such\r\n    widespread attention throughout the country. Still I should\r\n    like, for the encouragement of any of your boys who may think\r\n    themselves behind in the simply scientific race, to observe that\r\n    instructions given (let them be conveyed in what terms the\r\n    teacher will) must be founded to start with, on facts,\r\n    trustworthily observed and trustworthily recorded; and the pupil\r\n    who leaves your school with the knowledge of the appearance of\r\n    the common crop pests, as the wireworm, the turnip flea beetle,\r\n    the warble fly maggot for instance, and, as I am well aware is\r\n    the case with many of your boys, adds to this a practical\r\n    knowledge of how to lessen their powers of mischief, goes forth\r\n    holding in his mind what will save him many a pound in the\r\n    future, and be a benefit wherever he goes. It is a foundation on\r\n    which as much as he pleases may be built, but the solidly learnt\r\n    field knowledge will always be serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _June 5, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I thank you very much for your kind letter. If I were nearer it\r\n    would be a great pleasure to me to be present on your prize day,\r\n    when I might have the gratification of making personal\r\n    acquaintance with many of those whom I know by name as taking\r\n    much interest in this important school as well as yourself, whom\r\n    I should much like to meet; and also our “Aldersey boys,” whom I\r\n    have known and worked with, or they with me, for so many years.\r\n\r\n    It is a very great pleasure to me that they are continuing their\r\n    attention, under your skilled help and guidance, to observation\r\n    of farm pests, and their work stands first as a proof of what\r\n    can be done in getting rid of one insect pest.\r\n\r\n    When careful search only produces twenty warble grubs, in a\r\n    district[58] where a few years ago they were counted by\r\n    hundreds, to my thinking we—that is, the boys, you and I—may\r\n    fairly be proud of a thoroughly useful work. If I might venture\r\n    on a kind of little moral reflection I should say that I should\r\n    like the little prizes which I have so much pleasure in\r\n    offering, to remind them sometimes of how much can be done, in\r\n    many other things also, by even moderate attention given at the\r\n    right time and under the guidance of sound knowledge. I trust\r\n    they will continue their field work. With the increase of area\r\n    under cultivation or occupied by stock so may their insect pests\r\n    be expected to increase, and on sound knowledge of what really\r\n    happens, and what at a paying rate can be brought to our aid,\r\n    our hope rests of coping with the farmer’s enemies. What I can\r\n    do to help them by advice, or by reply to inquiries, will be\r\n    gladly at their service. Whilst I congratulate those who have\r\n    won my little tokens of goodwill, and beg to offer the same for\r\n    the next prize day, I must say to all that in the information\r\n    and benefit they have laid up in their working and observations\r\n    they have each gained a prize far better than anything I can\r\n    offer them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 29, 1894._\r\n\r\n    It is with most sincere pleasure that I hear from you once again\r\n    this year of the good success of the Aldersey boys in their\r\n    studies and of their steadiness in work. The methods by which\r\n    serviceable instruction on this subject, namely, Agricultural\r\n    Entomology, can be given is often a matter of difficulty and\r\n    doubt, and I certainly think that the plan you mention to me is\r\n    so good, and meets the points of combining practical knowledge\r\n    with so much scientific information as is requisite, so well\r\n    that I shall gladly draw the attention of those who apply to me\r\n    for suggestions on these subjects to its serviceableness. You\r\n    mention arranging the observations of the boys who take up the\r\n    study of crop and fruit pests on a system which, though so\r\n    simply worked, really forms an excellently complete course. You\r\n    say that one week the boys bring samples of infestation\r\n    injurious to fruit; in a second week attacks on garden\r\n    vegetables; in another week on field crops; in another on\r\n    timber; in another living examples of the subjects figured in\r\n    the insect diagrams which my sister and I have had the pleasure\r\n    of contributing to your school collections, and in yet another\r\n    week you receive notes of serviceable means of prevention and\r\n    remedies. This plan appears to me so sound and good that I hope\r\n    I may be forgiven for intruding a few minutes on your time in\r\n    greatly desiring to draw the attention of the influential\r\n    visitors who will be present at your meeting to how excellently\r\n    this plan meets many difficulties. A boy so taught knows his\r\n    facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _June 2, 1895._\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for your letter received yesterday morning, which is\r\n    very interesting indeed to me, and which I hope to reply to very\r\n    soon, but now I am replying to your note accompanying the\r\n    caterpillars from the Peckforton Hills, though not so fully as I\r\n    could wish, for disasters befell the letter, and it arrived by\r\n    special messenger from the Post Office, with the announcement\r\n    that the things had got loose, and were creeping all about! Any\r\n    way but little remained to judge by, so I report on what was\r\n    visible. Most of the caterpillars were loopers (fig. 30), and\r\n    the largest proportion of these, though differing so much in\r\n    colour, appeared to me to be the _Cheimatobia brumata_. As you\r\n    know there may be every variety of shade in these Winter moth\r\n    caterpillars, from pale green down to smoky brown or almost\r\n    black. Another kind of which I only find two specimens (small\r\n    and very small, respectively), look as if when grown they would\r\n    be the Mottled Umber moth, which is so injurious this year.\r\n    There are just single specimens of a few other non-looper kinds,\r\n    but at this present time all the kinds come under only one\r\n    method of (feasible) treatment, and I am afraid this (even if\r\n    feasible) would be much too costly on such a great scale.\r\n    Washing with Paris-green or London-purple, or with kerosene\r\n    emulsion, would be the right thing, or our British form of the\r\n    emulsion, made by Messrs. Morris, Little and Son, Doncaster, and\r\n    sold, I believe, at a very low price (consequent on the large\r\n    demand for it), under the trade name of “antipest.” This only\r\n    needs diluting. But when we come to dealing with great areas\r\n    like the Peckforton Woods, I believe that the only really\r\n    practicable way of, in some degree, lessening the evil, and\r\n    counteracting its effects, is throwing water from some large\r\n    engine. If a fire engine and a supply of water were available\r\n    this might do a great deal of good.\r\n\r\n    I was consulted by the late Sir Harry Verney about “an ancestral\r\n    oak” at Clayden, which appeared nearly cleared of leafage, and I\r\n    advised playing the house fire engine on it—and the plan\r\n    succeeded. The moisture falling around the tree pushed on the\r\n    second leafage and (conjecturally) saved the tree. But with\r\n    woods it is most difficult to manage application. I am afraid I\r\n    am only able to say what would be best, if it could be done.\r\n\r\n    For the future it is a grave consideration, and consultation is\r\n    very desirable, as to what means could reasonably and safely be\r\n    employed to destroy the caterpillar in the ground. They will\r\n    probably be very soon leaving the trees, and burying themselves\r\n    just below the surface, and will most likely reappear, in moth\r\n    form, and ascend the trees, beginning in the early winter, and\r\n    thus eggs will be laid to start next year’s attack. I do not\r\n    know whether the ground growths would permit of anything like\r\n    paring being done under the trees. The best way would be “sticky\r\n    banding” in October. At the Toddington fruit grounds one year\r\n    120,000 trees were sticky banded, but still this is work on an\r\n    enormous scale. These are the main points to work on, and I\r\n    should be very much pleased to enter on any of them more in\r\n    detail, but just now I am writing as soon as I can (before going\r\n    to church), as with Sunday and Bank Holiday posts I am afraid\r\n    this letter will not, at the earliest, reach you until Tuesday\r\n    morning, so please excuse such hastily written lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSAMPLE OF THE SCRAP NOTES LEFT BY MISS ORMEROD RELATING TO THE GREAT\r\nWATER BEETLE RECOGNISED BY THE PRINCE OF WALES, NOW KING EDWARD VII., AT\r\nST.

Her\r\n  Majesty’s discriminating observation\r\n  made me permit myself to say\r\n  that she should have been an Entomologist.\r\n  And our King recognised\r\n  at a glance the great water\r\n  beetles the Dytiscus marginalis\r\n  as a kind which he well\r\n  knew as injurious to fish spawn.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 6, 1896._\r\n\r\n    Now I am working on my Exhibit of Economic Entomology for the\r\n    Bath and West of England Society Show at St. Albans. I think you\r\n    will perhaps like to look at the enclosed set of labels for the\r\n    cases.[59] There are only a few lines to be fixed outside each.\r\n    In the catalogue there is a fuller account, with prevention and\r\n    remedy. Is it not a triumph of condensation to get a little life\r\n    history and prevention and remedy of Wireworm into about half a\r\n    dozen lines? But really there is enough if people would mind it.\r\n    I try to give injured material wherever I can, and there are\r\n    upwards of sixty infestations. Georgiana helps me with twenty\r\n    diagrams—more beautiful than any of her previous ones—and the\r\n    Council, who are very kind, have awarded us all the privileges\r\n    of stewards and members of Council for the Show, so that we may\r\n    have every convenience of transit there.\r\n\r\n    It gave me great pleasure to be appointed External Examiner in\r\n    Agricultural Entomology at Edinburgh University—for besides\r\n    enjoying such a great compliment it will help my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 30, 1896._\r\n\r\n    N.B. _Confidential._ I want to tell you how kind and nice the\r\n    Prince and Princess were at the Show. T.R.H. shook hands when\r\n    they arrived, quite heartily, and when I had explained my own\r\n    and my sister’s exhibit I thought I was to retire, but I found I\r\n    was to attend round the other exhibits in the building, so I\r\n    walked on by the Princess—just think, at the head of the Royal\r\n    party, before the Prince and all of them! When we had gone round\r\n    the Prince said, “Now, I think we must be going,” and he shook\r\n    hands again, and the Princess, who was a little ahead, turned\r\n    back and shook hands also. I was told by one of the officials\r\n    that the Prince expressed himself afterwards as much interested,\r\n    and my informant had told the Prince that I was doing work in\r\n    this country which was done in other countries by the State.\r\n    H.R.H. was so interested about the warbles that he called up\r\n    Lord Clarendon to look at the great photo of the warbled\r\n    red-deer’s hide too, and we had quite a chat together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—WATER BEETLE, _DYTISCUS MARGINALIS_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _June 15, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I had great pleasure in receiving your very kind letter, and I\r\n    thought a great deal of you, and your flock, on the prize day.\r\n    But now I am troubling you (the idea occurred too late to be of\r\n    use at the time), to ask whether you would at all care to have\r\n    (say) ten copies of my “Manual of Injurious Insects,” to give\r\n    just as you may think fit as an encouragement to the boys—or\r\n    perhaps a present here or there to one who might be leaving\r\n    school and taking up farming. I should like it very much. You\r\n    have it yourself and (I think?) one for the school library, and\r\n    Mr. D. E. Byrd must have his father’s copy, but if you cared to\r\n    have some copies it would really give me very great pleasure.\r\n    Though fruit-insect prevention has made great advances in the\r\n    last few years, this is not a special Cheshire interest, the\r\n    agricultural observations are very correct still.\r\n\r\n    Mr. D. E. Byrd has kindly given me some very good information\r\n    about Cheese-fly maggot attack, just precisely what I was\r\n    wishing for, and also something of the principle of prevention.\r\n    Mr. Ward [Organising Secretary of the Cheshire County Council]\r\n    was kind enough to procure me some good information from Miss\r\n    Forster [of the Cheshire Dairy School], and I hope to form a\r\n    good paper by and by. All I really want now in this matter are a\r\n    few of the “hopping” maggots, which most likely will turn up\r\n    soon. Curiously enough, just at the time, I had an application\r\n    from a bacon-curing Co. and I think we have on both sides\r\n    benefited.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Fly; 2, pupa; 3, pupa-case; 4, maggot—all magnified, with lines\r\n    showing natural length; 5, tail extremity, still more magnified,\r\n    showing spiracles, tracheæ, and caudal tubercles.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—CHEESE AND BACON FLY, _PIOPHILA CASEI_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 5, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I now, with many thanks for the clearness with which you have\r\n    been good enough to note precisely the form of the presentation\r\n    labels, enclose twelve, only altering by adding to the slips for\r\n    the three boys, the prefix of “Mr.” I am sure they will like it.\r\n    I fancy I see them surreptitiously turning to the donatory slip,\r\n    to enjoy their rise!

Indeed it is a\r\n    trouble to me that I am not able to write oftener, but nobody\r\n    knows better than yourself (who are so burdened with work for\r\n    the good of others) how hard work can be, and if I quite\r\n    overwork I am ill, so I am afraid to do all I wish.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for your kind congratulations. I take it as a very\r\n    great honour for the University of Edinburgh to give me a Doctor\r\n    of Laws Degree, &c., &c., &c. I am a little anxious about making\r\n    such a very public appearance, but I dare say it will not be so\r\n    alarming when it comes to the point. But I do not wish to go out\r\n    of my own quiet lines, and I do not certainly wish to be called\r\n    “Doctor.” Would not the right thing be for me to just put LL.D.\r\n    after my name where desirable?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                                   _April 26, 1901_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. BAILEY,—I have postponed replying to your kind\r\n    letter partly because I have had a long exhausting illness, and\r\n    partly because I am sure that you will regret the subject of my\r\n    letter, as I do myself. Still I think I ought to tell you that I\r\n    am purposing quite to discontinue my regular entomological work.\r\n    You would notice what I said about the Annual Reports, but the\r\n    attention to insect inquiries and (almost worse) the requests\r\n    for co-operation in philanthropic literary schemes had become a\r\n    burthen so very injurious to me that I was warned both by my\r\n    doctor and literary colleagues that without rest the\r\n    consequences might be very serious. All last year my health was\r\n    failing, and (though this is temporary) an attack of influenza\r\n    early in March, followed by what are called “effects,” has\r\n    caused me great suffering.\r\n\r\n    But it is in reference to our long, kindly colleagueship that I\r\n    am writing to you. Natural history is on a very different\r\n    footing now from what it was in 1884, when with your good help\r\n    our good lads started the investigations regarding Warble, which\r\n    have proved to the whole world the possibility of checking this\r\n    wasteful attack, and I may add they have carried the work on\r\n    with their own steady, patient, long-continued energy. To this I\r\n    must add my great appreciation of their useful work in real\r\n    serviceable Economic Entomology, and the kindliness and\r\n    heartiness of their work.\r\n\r\n    But now yourself, your school and your scholars have a\r\n    world-wide name, and as you will fully appreciate that to\r\n    continue, however much I may wish it, publicly attached to any\r\n    one philanthropic economic work throws me open still to whole\r\n    hosts of applications, I am sure you will understand my wish to\r\n    withdraw. You have I think my subscription for your next great\r\n    June day, and after that I, with much regret, purpose to\r\n    discontinue it. I look back on many years’ kindly communication\r\n    from you, but if you could have any idea of the labour which has\r\n    been thrown on me from other quarters, I am sure you would think\r\n    I am right. I earnestly and sincerely beg you to believe me with\r\n    feelings of the highest esteem and friendship and every good\r\n    wish,\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

GIBB\r\n\r\nGreat Tortoiseshell Butterfly—The Forest Fly—Numerous other fly-pests\r\n    and fly-parasites—A few Moths.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined letters to Mr. Gibb are unique in that they deal with a\r\nwider range of subjects than any of Miss Ormerod’s letters to other\r\nBritish observers. She recognised and appreciated her correspondent’s\r\naccuracy of observation, and gratefully acknowledged the assistance she\r\nreceived through the numerous specimens he so promptly collected for her\r\nwhen in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _To D. D. Gibb, Esq., Assembly Manor Farm, Lymington._[60]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                                    _June 26, 1894_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,—I am very much obliged to you for kindly sparing time\r\n    to let me have your careful observations received this morning,\r\n    together with the specimens of the Great Tortoiseshell\r\n    butterfly, _Vanessa polychloros_, infestation. I have been very\r\n    carefully noting, measuring and counting, so as to secure\r\n    details, and presently I think with your own observations these\r\n    will form a very serviceably interesting paper. That patch of\r\n    eggshells contained over three hundred eggs, as near as I could\r\n    count by taking numbers in length and breadth. Your two\r\n    caterpillars had been over hasty in their arrangements, and\r\n    changed to chrysalis on the journey, and consequently made not a\r\n    good business of it, but one of those you sent me previously,\r\n    having better surroundings had done its work thoroughly well,\r\n    and is a very beautiful specimen which I hope will develop. I\r\n    propose to have a good figure engraved of the butterfly,\r\n    chrysalis and caterpillar.\r\n\r\n    All your other notes I have also read with much interest,\r\n    especially those on turnip management, and your remarks about\r\n    “warble,” and in due time I shall be much obliged by being\r\n    allowed to use these in my next Annual Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Caterpillar and chrysalis, natural size; branched spine from\r\n  caterpillar, magnified.\r\n  FIG. 13.—GREAT TORTOISE-SHELL BUTTERFLY, _VANESSA POLYCHLOROS_, L.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 27, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I am very much pleased to hear that you have hatched two of the\r\n    Large Tortoiseshell butterflies from your specimens. This is\r\n    very interesting as completing your previous observation, and I\r\n    am particularly glad of this note of date of development for I\r\n    am afraid that the only really good chrysalis which I secured\r\n    from your larvæ does not seem likely to develop. However, it\r\n    gave me an opportunity of seeing the beautiful colours and the\r\n    six bright mother-of-pearl-like spots on the back. Many thanks\r\n    for kindly offering me a specimen, but I should not like to take\r\n    it—for it is of special interest with you to illustrate this\r\n    rare attack, and also it is very difficult to ensure safety in\r\n    transmission. Many thanks all the same, and also for your\r\n    Hessian fly specimens received a short time ago, and for the\r\n    further notes now. I am sorry not to have acknowledged them and\r\n    the information in the letter accompanying them sooner, but I\r\n    had a deal of work, and some temporary difficulty from breaking\r\n    a blood-vessel in one eye. However I am thankful to say that is\r\n    all right again.\r\n\r\n    I have no doubt you are right about the weather making a most\r\n    important amount of difference in extent of injury both from\r\n    Hessian fly and Diamond-back attack. If it had been hot I am\r\n    afraid _Plutella cruciferarum_ (Diamond-back moth) would have\r\n    done a deal of mischief. The little Charlock weevil,\r\n    _Ceuthorhyncus contractus_ (see my seventeenth, 1890, report),\r\n    has been doing a great deal of mischief to young turnips at some\r\n    places on the east side of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  In usual position, and also with wings expanded—magnified; also\r\n    natural size.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.—CHARLOCK WEEVIL, _CEUTHORHYNCUS CONTRACTUS_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 30, 1894._\r\n\r\n    The _V. polychloros_ specimen came to hand little, if at all,\r\n    injured by its journey, and in beautiful order for figuring. I\r\n    am very glad to have it, for besides proving the caterpillars to\r\n    be of the “great tortoiseshell,” I had the opportunity of seeing\r\n    the row of long bristles or stout hairs about a third along the\r\n    lower part of the front edge (the costa) of the fore-wings. This\r\n    row of hairs is the structural difference between this “great\r\n    tortoiseshell,” and the “small tortoiseshell” (which is without\r\n    them), but otherwise the two species are so much alike that\r\n    there used to be doubts whether they were not merely varieties\r\n    until this point was noticed by a Dutch entomologist, Mr.\r\n    Snellen. I shall be glad to refer to this point, for it is\r\n    important and was observed after our chief manuals of\r\n    _Lepidoptera_ were published.\r\n\r\n    On referring to your letter accompanying the Hessian fly\r\n    puparia, “flax-seeds,” in which you notice some of them being\r\n    within the stalks, I remembered I had not precisely replied to\r\n    this part, so I do it now. I think this position, though not\r\n    characteristic, is not very uncommon, and is caused by a\r\n    weakness of the stem.

I mean the thick made fly of which I enclose a\r\n    figure (18), natural size and magnified, which deposits an\r\n    egg-like puparium or chrysalis case in the hair of the horses,\r\n    from which case the fly presently comes out. I believe you will\r\n    know exactly the infestation I refer to, and any information\r\n    which you may be good enough to give me, as to how to prevent it\r\n    coming at horses and settling on them, I know would be quite\r\n    sound and reliable. I am receiving so much application for\r\n    information about the habits, &c., &c., that I feel sure my best\r\n    plan will be to issue a leaflet as soon as possible with figure\r\n    included at the heading. I have, I think I may say, far more in\r\n    the way of description and nature of the fly than can be needed,\r\n    but it would help me very much indeed to have a recipe for any\r\n    application which was really known to answer in keeping the\r\n    attack off riding horses. I am sure you would allow me to add\r\n    this to my leaflet, acknowledged to you. I make no doubt\r\n    quantities of things, especially of the nature of soap or soft\r\n    soap (not caustic) or lard, and a little paraffin or sulphur,\r\n    would with careful attention keep the flies from congregating\r\n    permanently, but the thing in hand is to prevent them coming at\r\n    the horses and causing dismal downfalls! I have heard lately of\r\n    a plan of rubbing horses with paraffin—very efficacious, I\r\n    should expect, but not the thing to benefit the clothes of the\r\n    riders!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1 and 2, natural size and magnified from life; 3, pupa removed from\r\n    puparium (after Réaumur); puparium, natural size and magnified,\r\n    before complete coloration.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—FOREST FLY, _HIPPOBOSCA EQUINA_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     _Wednesday night, May 1, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I am exceedingly obliged to you for your most helpful letter and\r\n    the live specimen, which I learnt a great deal from, before we\r\n    re-captured it, and stopped its activity with some benzine. It\r\n    slipped out of my fingers somehow, out of your careful packing,\r\n    and kept flying at my light woollen shawl, varied by taking a\r\n    promenade (which I was very conscious of) on the top of my head.\r\n    It struck me as suggestive that it selected me (not my sister or\r\n    our housekeeper) for this purpose, because I never use any kind\r\n    of pomatum. I like my hair as smooth as can be, so the creature\r\n    did not establish itself, but judging by feeling, it had much\r\n    pleasure in its survey. I noticed the set of the wings, and\r\n    perhaps I can get a figure.\r\n\r\n    When the flies are more plentiful, so that it would not give you\r\n    too much trouble to secure some, I certainly should like two or\r\n    three very much, but please do not let me intrude too much on\r\n    your good nature and time.

What a very grand fellow\r\n    he is, and how very painful the attack must be. I have to-day\r\n    written to Mr. R. H. Meade about this great variety of Gadflies\r\n    which you are letting me have, and offering to send him\r\n    duplicates.\r\n\r\n    Many thanks also for first, and as yet only, note of presence of\r\n    Hessian fly this season. About these curious markings on the\r\n    side of the straw—are they not very like those of the maggots,\r\n    “red maggots,” of the _Diplosis equestris_, the _Cecidomyia_ or\r\n    Great midge, mentioned in my thirteenth Report, at p. 30? I\r\n    think you have this report, and if you chanced to have leisure\r\n    to compare some specimens with my sketch, you would see what you\r\n    thought. The workings do not seem to me as regular, but yet\r\n    there is a strong resemblance.\r\n\r\n    I am working up the Gadflies as well as time allows, and through\r\n    courtesy of Mr. Janson have had a loan of a volume published in\r\n    1842 of a serial called “Isis” so as to be able to study the\r\n    very special paper in it by Zeller, which is the authority on\r\n    some of the important points, and which cannot now be bought by\r\n    itself. I thought this was a kind help, for the whole book is\r\n    very costly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 31, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I have a promise from Professor Mik, who is a special authority\r\n    on flies, that when he returns to Vienna he will let me have\r\n    such duplicates of the _Tabanidæ_ as he has, which will be a\r\n    great help. I have had an artist down from London who has made\r\n    most beautiful drawings for engraving of the fly’s foot (plates\r\n    XXIII. XXIV.), but I greatly want some dissections made of it,\r\n    and I have only this morning heard where I could get this minute\r\n    work done. Would you mind the trouble of once again letting me\r\n    have two or three Forest flies? I should be very much obliged,\r\n    for though I keep the specimens most carefully that you let me\r\n    have, some quite fresh would answer much better for dissection.\r\n\r\n    It is very curious that until Mr. Goodall (a highly accomplished\r\n    veterinary surgeon) noticed the long bristle attached to the _H.\r\n    equina_ foot, no one except that wonderful observer De Geer\r\n    appears to have noticed it, or what is perhaps still more\r\n    astonishing, repeated De Geer’s observation and figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXIII.\r\n  Horace Knight ad nat del West.

As this rare bird is stated to have a fondness for this\r\n    special kind of ant I conjectured its presence was caused by the\r\n    _fuliginosa_ being present. Their workings were wonderfully\r\n    destructive in the felled stump which they chose for\r\n    headquarters. I certainly think you need no advice from me on\r\n    the head of dealing with them, but it just occurred to me that,\r\n    if they come in a definite line still, and you could not run\r\n    them up to their starting point, it might answer to put a couple\r\n    of half-decayed stumps across their line of march. Might they\r\n    not adopt the suggested new settlement?\r\n\r\n    I am getting on with the Forest fly and lately I have been\r\n    studying the claws. I have only just discovered that along the\r\n    lower part of the large-curved claw is a saw-toothed edge, and\r\n    to this the slanting grooves which I had previously noticed run\r\n    down one furrow to each notch so as to give an enormous power of\r\n    holding and tearing. I think the thumb claw is also to some\r\n    degree furnished both with saw- and file-like markings (fig.\r\n    22).\r\n\r\n    P.S. I can only see the saw and file mark with a good side\r\n    light, when the claw is examined in natural state, not in\r\n    balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Much magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—FOOT OF FOREST FLY, _HIPPOBOSCA EQUINA_, SHOWING DOUBLE\r\n    CLAWS, CENTRAL PROCESS, AND LONG PRICKLY BRISTLE; ALSO PORTION OF\r\n    SIDE OF CLAW OF _HIPPOBOSCA MACULATA_, SHOWING PARALLEL GROOVES AND\r\n    SAW-EDGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Leg and base of wing; 2, base of wing; 3, abortive wing; 5, female\r\n    fly, with base of wings—all much magnified; 4, puparium, much\r\n    magnified, and line showing natural length.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—DEER FOREST FLY (FEMALE), _LIPOPTERA CERVI_, VON SIEBOLD AND\r\n    LOEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _June 20, 18096._\r\n\r\n    I was very glad to have your note of first capture of\r\n    _Hippobosca_ (Forest fly) on May 6th. I wonder whether on your\r\n    Red-Deer (or Roe Deer, if you have them) you find the Deer\r\n    Forest fly, the _Lipoptena cervi_. I am having a deal of\r\n    communication about it as having been observed as a very\r\n    noticeable infestation on Deer in one locality in the North of\r\n    Scotland. I believe it is troublesome to people moving in the\r\n    parts it frequents, but the odd thing about it is, that whilst\r\n    the females are considered (or conjectured, for it is not quite\r\n    certain) to be always wingless, yet the male flies are developed\r\n    with wings and drop them, something like ants, on settling on a\r\n    host animal. It would be very interesting if you found any of\r\n    these; they come very near the so-called “Sheep tick” in their\r\n    nature, only neither male nor female of the “Sheep Forest flies”\r\n    is ever winged. It is also very curious that from some\r\n    unaccountable confusion the generic name has gone wrong; it\r\n    seems obvious it should be _Lipoptera_, “without wings,” but—it\r\n    is supposed by some error in printing—_Lipoptena_, which has no\r\n    meaning connected with the fly, has got substituted. I think it\r\n    would be well presently to try to get this put right.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  With wings thrown off; also still retaining wings; and wing—all\r\n  much magnified.

He thinks the _glaucopus_ is\r\n    more like _cognatus_, but Brauer of Vienna says the latter is\r\n    only probably a variety of the former, so this is no great\r\n    matter. Mr. Meade is not only an eminently skilled dipterist\r\n    himself, but he also possesses a collection of the _Tabanidæ_\r\n    (our British kinds) named for him by Dr. Brauer, the great\r\n    continental authority. So now we stand on a very firm footing\r\n    (thanks to the trouble which you and Mr. Moens were good enough\r\n    to take in supplying me with fresh specimens) as to the species\r\n    of these bloodsucking pests which you have in the Forest. Would\r\n    you tell Mr. Moens about this when you see him, with my\r\n    compliments and thanks? I think you meet sometimes.

First, about the Hessian fly\r\n    straw. If you came on some that had been infested this would\r\n    answer excellently. I have got some “flax-seeds” and I could\r\n    slip some in. But really the “elbowed” straw (bent over) into an\r\n    angle (fig. 16) is what I want to show. I have excellent Gout\r\n    specimens. One thing I should particularly like is a little bit\r\n    of Mangold-leaf (say two or three inches square) showing Mangold\r\n    maggot blister. I could dry this in blotting paper (like my pea-\r\n    bean- and clover-leaf injuries from _Sitones_) and with a good\r\n    supply of Mangold fly and pupæ which I have got, I think this\r\n    would be very nice. I have good grubs of Carrion Beet beetle,\r\n    which would be difficult to get, and I think plenty of the\r\n    beetle (or at hand), but, for the mangold, if I could get them,\r\n    I should very much like some of the Spotted or Black millepedes\r\n    which were such pests earlier in the year. I am afraid though it\r\n    is too late now. The only other thing which I am very much\r\n    wishing for is a good specimen of apple twig, injured by\r\n    American blight. A bit from six to nine inches long, which I\r\n    could split down, would suit me very nicely.\r\n\r\n    I may mention that I am preparing an exhibit for the Bath and\r\n    West of England Agricultural Society Show next May, but I am\r\n    collecting beforehand to be sure. This afternoon I have arranged\r\n    a nice case to show Bean and Pea seed and Leaf weevil injuries.\r\n    [See Appendix C for list of cases and contents.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 22, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I am greatly obliged to you for the very acceptable parcel of\r\n    specimens, which arrived in excellent order this morning. Indeed\r\n    I feel very much indebted to you, for I know the trouble it\r\n    takes to collect and pack in this careful way. The Hessian fly\r\n    wheat was particularly acceptable as I had just two or three old\r\n    straws, but this to freshen them up (with the insect and\r\n    figures) makes a beautiful exhibit. The mangold leaves are also\r\n    a great help; and nothing could be more characteristic than the\r\n    American blight. I have not fully examined the contents of the\r\n    bottles, but I see some nice _Julus guttatus_ (Snake millepedes)\r\n    and also a few of the long, thin, yellow, electrical centipedes,\r\n    which I shall hope will keep their colour nicely in spirits.\r\n    Indeed it is a very welcome contribution.\r\n\r\n    I have been ill with rather a bad quinsy, followed by something\r\n    going wrong with my mouth and tongue, but I have nearly\r\n    recovered now, and as I was directed to keep indoors, I have\r\n    been getting on with the cases.\r\n\r\n    Besides the more customary crop and other attacks, I thought\r\n    such things as liver-flukes (in spirit) and a good number of the\r\n    little “water snails,” _Limnæa truncatula_, (such tiny shells!),\r\n    which is their host in the early stage, with figures of the\r\n    intermediate conditions, would be of useful interest; also a\r\n    couple of bottles with contents of sparrows’ crops, showing the\r\n    great amount of corn they eat, as well as a number of locusts in\r\n    the condition in which they are imported in lucerne from Buenos\r\n    Aires.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Julus londinensis; 3, Julus guttatus (pulchellus, Leach); 4, Julus\r\n  terrestris; 5, horn; 7, Polydesmus complanatus—all magnified; and\r\n  2 and 6, natural size.\r\n  FIG. 27—CENTIPEDES AND A MILLEPEDE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Infested apple spray, natural size; wingless viviparous female and\r\n    young clothed with cottony fibres above; and small egg-bearing\r\n    female beneath the spray; pupa with little cottony growth—all\r\n    magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.—AMERICAN BLIGHT, WOOLLY APHIS, _SCHIZONEURA LANIGERA_, HAUSM.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 26, 1895._\r\n\r\n    This sort of brickdust-like deposit is, I think, eggs. I had a\r\n    quantity of it sent me about six weeks ago by a fruit salesman\r\n    and auctioneer who had got 10,000 apple trees infested. It\r\n    agrees in measurement and colour, &c., with the general\r\n    description given by Mr. Frazer Crawford (of Adelaide) of the\r\n    eggs of the Red spider, _Bryobia ? speciosa_, (fig. 52) found\r\n    on apple in South Australia, but I do not think we can be\r\n    quite certain of its nature until the contents hatch. About\r\n    ten days ago I thought that I found fungi developing in the\r\n    patches, so I sent a good supply to Professor M. C. Potter\r\n    (Botanical Professor of Durham College of Science), for I was\r\n    sure whatever he would say would be trustworthy. He wrote me\r\n    that there was fungus amongst the red spheres. He did not\r\n    believe that they were fungoid; but thought, like me, that\r\n    they were eggs. Certainly you are right in considering them\r\n    not American blight, although on one of the twigs you have\r\n    sent me there is a swelled cankered piece that looks very\r\n    much, to general observation, like that attack. I wish I could\r\n    give you a plain straightforward answer, but the above is the\r\n    best I can tell you at present. Mr. Nixon, whose name you will\r\n    remember in my yearly reports connected with Red spider, says\r\n    that he knows this “red deposit” well and does not think it\r\n    does harm, but I should think it would be but prudent to have\r\n    some soft soap mixture or antipest at hand, against hot\r\n    sunshine in late winter days.\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for your good wishes, which I heartily reciprocate,\r\n    to you and to your young people. I cannot say I have been well.\r\n    However, I am much better, but we are anxious, for my only\r\n    remaining brother (who is nearly eighty) had a stroke of palsy\r\n    last year, and on Sunday he had a second, but he is not\r\n    suffering, which is a great comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Moth; caterpillars hanging by their threads, slightly larger than\r\n    life; rolled oak-leaf.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.—OAK-LEAF ROLLER MOTH, _TORTRIX VIRIDANA_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _July 3, 1896._\r\n\r\n    I thank you very much for taking the trouble to send me this\r\n    good supply of _Tabanidæ_, and still more especially for the\r\n    Forest flies. I thought these were all dead, but whilst I was\r\n    opening the bit of straw in which you pack them so cleverly,\r\n    they began to tear out headlong—luckily I thought of catching\r\n    the whole affair together in my closed hand, and then, pouring\r\n    some chloroform in between my fingers, I got them all safe.\r\n\r\n    I am very much interested about this poor young woman’s death\r\n    from poisoning by a fly or insect attack.[62] I wish it had been\r\n    possible to secure the pest, it would be so really useful to\r\n    make out whether the evil was from the nature of the bite or\r\n    sting, or whether from ill health or other cause the sufferer\r\n    was unusually susceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Male; and wingless females.

I conjecture they would be loopers (? Winter or Mottled\r\n    Umber moth), for you note that “the moths appeared unusually\r\n    early, and as soon as the bud began to open, the little\r\n    caterpillars were upon them,” and I think you would be referring\r\n    to the early appearance last autumn of the Winter moth. But a\r\n    note from you would be very valuable. I am wanting to make a\r\n    really good paper on “Leafage Caterpillars”—people seem not to\r\n    understand that though the remedies we know of can be used at a\r\n    paying rate on orchard trees that we can get at, yet, for a mile\r\n    of avenue “ancestral timber!” or for woods with their trees\r\n    touching, and no passage for machines, the expense of treatment\r\n    could not be met.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 5, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I am greatly obliged to you for your very interesting and\r\n    valuable observations, and for the accompanying specimens of\r\n    corn attacks.

I do not\r\n    remember having had wheat attacked by _Chlorops_ before, though\r\n    it is subject to the attack, and it is years since I have had\r\n    the Sawfly attack. In one stem the grub had spun itself a\r\n    beautiful case just within the lowest part of the stem, and\r\n    being kept steady in the transparent covering, it gave me an\r\n    excellent opportunity of examining it.\r\n\r\n    I am very glad also of your definite observation of presence of\r\n    Diamond-back moth.

I have\r\n    examined the specimens, and it seems to me that those of the\r\n    Hessian fly attack close to the root are of the same nature as\r\n    some I have had before. I think your notes would be interesting\r\n    for my next Annual Report. I was very much pleased to notice\r\n    some time back, that in an official U.S.A. report, attention was\r\n    markedly drawn to the great importance of destroying puparia of\r\n    Hessian fly as a means of keeping attacks in check.

I got my gardener to syringe the\r\n    brassicaceous plants with “antipest” as an experiment, and I\r\n    certainly think that afterwards there was not nearly as large a\r\n    proportion of the butterflies on the cabbage as in the adjacent\r\n    flower garden.\r\n\r\n         Believe me,\r\n\r\n              Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                   ELEANOR A.

Nat. Hist.” Will this be the attack figured\r\n    (in its effect on the deer) in Dr. Brauer’s spirited\r\n    frontispiece to his “Œstridæ”?[63]\r\n\r\n    [In the last few days I have had sent a nice specimen of the\r\n    Throat Deer botfly, _C. rufibarbis_, which I alluded to in my\r\n    nineteenth Report. It is a very handsome fly, more than half an\r\n    inch long, and of very broad make (three-eighths across the\r\n    abdomen), thickly clothed with very dark hair (but much either\r\n    mixed with or tipped with orange), and on each side of the\r\n    thorax a good-sized pale patch, and beneath the chin the red\r\n    beard from which it takes its name. I scarcely think it would\r\n    occur in the New Forest, but, if it did, it would be quite a\r\n    rare prize.][64]\r\n\r\n    Have you (if I may venture to ask) extended your researches to\r\n    the _Hypoderma_ (Warble fly), of our British deer? It would be\r\n    usefully interesting, I think, if we could work this up. I am\r\n    doing what I can, with help from some of the head-keepers, &c.,\r\n    and when deer-stalking is going on I am promised a warbled\r\n    red-deer’s hide for examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Rather larger than life; line showing natural length.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—RED-BEARDED BOTFLY, _CEPHENOMYIA RUFIBARBIS_, MEIG., BRAUER,\r\n    AND SCHINER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 17, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I had much pleasure in receiving your letter this morning, and\r\n    only wish I had a duplicate of the _Hypoderma bovis_ (Ox warble\r\n    fly, fig. 5), to spare—I would most gladly offer it, but now I\r\n    have only one. I never had many, and with my best endeavours I\r\n    cannot get people to rear them. I quite hope to have a hide of a\r\n    red-deer presently, and I think one might make out the larva of\r\n    the _H. diana_ (Deer warble fly), at least, by reference to fig.\r\n    6, tab. viii.—what do you think?\r\n\r\n    May I ask you to do me the pleasure of accepting the enclosed\r\n    copy of the “Œstridæ,” lately come rather curiously to my hands.\r\n    It was sent through a mistake instead of the separate impression\r\n    of Dr. Brauer’s “Tabanidæ,” and as I knew how difficult it was\r\n    to procure (especially with the plates), I kept it, feeling sure\r\n    it would be useful to some friend. I have a copy which I have\r\n    worked with for years, so I hope that you will not hesitate to\r\n    give me the pleasure of making this copy as useful as I am sure\r\n    it will be in your hands. I wish it were in better order. I see\r\n    that beneath the frontispiece of this copy is a reference to p.\r\n    186 in the “Biologie von Cephenomyia, &c.,” but I suppose my\r\n    frontispiece is a “proof before letters,” for there is no\r\n    reference or description. The two are the same edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _January 9, 1897._\r\n\r\n    My _rufibarbis_ was sent to me by Mr. Dugald Campbell from\r\n    Strathconan Forest, Muir of Ord, Ross-shire. I received it on\r\n    June 8th, then quite fresh—and such a beauty! With its long\r\n    thick coat it almost might be called furry, and the “glance” on\r\n    the hairs was lovely. It was rather darker in some parts (that\r\n    is, ran to rather more foxy red on the centre of the upper fore\r\n    part of the abdomen), than is noted by some observers, so that\r\n    it was very richly coloured, and its red beard was very\r\n    handsome. I have had a figure taken of it, with great care, and\r\n    if when you see it (for of course I hope you will accept a copy\r\n    of my next Annual Report, on publication), you think you would\r\n    like to borrow it any time for one of your papers, I should be\r\n    only happy to lend it you.\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

WISE,—If it would not give you too much trouble I\r\n    should be very glad of some information about the case of Caddis\r\n    worms attacking water-cresses. You will know these grubs quite\r\n    well as the creatures that go about in shallow ponds or ditches\r\n    with a case formed round them. Sometimes this is of very little\r\n    shells, but at home the commonest kind was made of little\r\n    morsels of rush or stick, with little leaves webbed up with it.\r\n\r\n    There is a very large trade in water-cresses from the little\r\n    river here, but there are such quantities of trout in it, that\r\n    probably these keep the Caddis worms in moderate limits, and I\r\n    only now and then see their flies, the so-called “Water moths”\r\n    in the summer. Mr. Richard Coe, Weston Farm, Guildford, has\r\n    kindly sent me some excellent specimens of Caddis worms and\r\n    cases, which I am very glad to have. The chief natural helpers\r\n    against over-presence of Caddis worms appear to be fish of\r\n    various kinds, but the increase of birds which naturally feed on\r\n    fish—herons, &c.,—destroys the balance of nature, and Caddis\r\n    worms increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Miss Ormerod, quoting Mr. Coe in her Report for 1896, says (p. 156):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Whenever we find a bed of cresses attacked, we clear away all\r\n    the plants, drain off the water, and leave the bed perfectly dry\r\n    for two or three weeks in the autumn, previous to the winter\r\n    planting. If afterwards we find traces of the worm, we wait\r\n    until the plants are well established, then we increase the\r\n    volume of water and swim the bed, and pass the backs of wooden\r\n    rakes over the tops of the plants very thoroughly. This process\r\n    brings the bulk of the worms to the surface, and they are let\r\n    off down-stream with the surplus water.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Water moth, magnified, and lines showing natural size (after\r\n    Westwood); Caddis worm “cases” of _Limnephilus flavicornis_,\r\n    magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 33.—CADDIS WORMS, LARVÆ OF CADDIS FLY OR WATER MOTH, _MORMONIA\r\n    NIGROMACULATA_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Fletcher she also wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Did I tell you about the Caddis worm attack on water-cresses?\r\n    So much harm was being done that the unlucky grower was in much\r\n    trouble, and on running the matter up it appeared that formerly\r\n    there were numbers of trout in the water, but lately the\r\n    landlord’s wife had a fancy to encourage herons, and so came the\r\n    curious sequence. The herons cleared off the insect-loving\r\n    trout, so the vegetable-eating insects got ahead, and the\r\n    watercress grower could not pay the rent of his half acre of\r\n    cresses. I suggested that as the herons were encouraged by the\r\n    lady, perhaps she, if applied to, might to some degree make good\r\n    the damages!”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 5, 1897._\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. WISE,—You asked my views about moles at Strawberry\r\n    roots. I should say it would be quite worth while to spare them\r\n    as you are doing, and see what comes of it. If they take the\r\n    _Otiorhynchus_ grub (of Orchard and Hop weevils) this would meet\r\n    a difficulty which we hardly know how to fight at present, and\r\n    if the moles took these grubs one might hope that they would\r\n    take other underground kinds, which are kitchen garden pests,\r\n    almost unconquerable by other remedial means. I should doubt,\r\n    however, whether they would be of much service against Winter\r\n    moth chrysalides (fig. 30). Very likely I am not right, but the\r\n    mole seems to me to prefer more open ground and a larger scope\r\n    of operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 8, 1897._\r\n\r\n    So far as I know the only treatment for Black Currant Gall mite,\r\n    _Phytoptus ribis_ (fig. 65), which has been in a measure\r\n    successful, is that reported by Mr. J. Biggs, of Laxton, East\r\n    Yorkshire, in my seventeenth Annual Report, p. 93. There, if you\r\n    will turn to it, you will see we have treatment to clear the\r\n    pest from all localities, whether straying on the twigs or on\r\n    the ground; or in the buds, this by breaking them off. Mr. Biggs\r\n    observed, writing on the 20th of April, 1892: “You will, I am\r\n    sure, be interested in knowing that I have, to a certain extent,\r\n    prevented the _Phytoptus_ utterly ruining my black currant\r\n    trees. As you suggested in a letter of last March, we syringed\r\n    the bushes twice with the solution of Paris-green, which I\r\n    procured from Messrs. Blundell, and gave the soil all under the\r\n    bushes a good coating of caustic lime; I also gave the bushes\r\n    another dressing of the Paris-green. Just when the buds appeared\r\n    this spring I had a boy gathering all the little knobs off the\r\n    trees. The result has proved as satisfactory as I could expect,\r\n    considering the condition of the trees last year, and I have\r\n    every prospect of securing a good half crop. Our neighbour’s\r\n    trees in this village are utterly ruined, scarcely a leaf to be\r\n    seen, and the trees completely covered with the affected knobs.”\r\n\r\n    But with regard to the life history of the pest, I believe it\r\n    breeds entirely in the infested buds, and I believe also breeds,\r\n    _i.e._, lays eggs, there at any time during the winter. I know\r\n    that the nearly allied nut-_Phytoptus_ does, for I have seen\r\n    them. Outside the buds, so far as I know, the life is wholly\r\n    spent in sheltering in crannies or straying about, on the stems,\r\n    or on the ground. What we want, appears to me to be, to clear\r\n    the mite by syringings from the stems when the buds (of which we\r\n    have now the galled growth) are first beginning to form. But I\r\n    do not see how we could do this, for we should ruin the fruit.\r\n    My only hope for real prevention where black-currants are grown\r\n    on this large scale, is in an alteration of the method of\r\n    cultivation. As it stands now, the mites can convey themselves,\r\n    or be carried by wind-borne leaves, or may creep from one bush\r\n    to another on the ground, but if there could be a mixing of some\r\n    field crop in strips with the black-currants, I believe it would\r\n    do a deal preventively. If the ground between the rows were\r\n    occupied by some crop that the _Phytopti_ would not pass, it\r\n    could not fail to lessen their presence. Even strips of\r\n    strawberries or of gooseberries would be beneficial. I wonder\r\n    whether kainite would be a good remedial application? It might\r\n    kill all the mites that are about, but it is quite plain to me\r\n    that, as nothing that has been tried for so many years answers\r\n    thoroughly, we are on the wrong lines and need a new plan. I\r\n    wish you would, at your leisure, tell me what you think of\r\n    mixing crops, and if you could let me have just a few little\r\n    bits of galled twigs for figuring, I should be very much\r\n    obliged. I wish I could help better about the matter, but so far\r\n    the attack appears to have fairly baffled us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 13, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged for these remarkably fine specimens of\r\n    Currant galls, which reached me safely this morning. About the\r\n    life history of the _Phytopti_, I do not think that anything\r\n    more is recorded than what both you and I know. But as we know\r\n    well that the mites are in the galls (such as you send me), it\r\n    seems to me that what we have got to act upon is their condition\r\n    (or locality, rather) in the time between their leaving these\r\n    galls and when they are starting new attack in the embryo buds.\r\n    I wish I could tell you more, but I do not see how to get at the\r\n    point of locality, excepting by watching shoots with a hand\r\n    magnifier. I really am quite at a loss as to what can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 19, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I wrote out to Vienna to Professor Dr. A. Nalepa, who is the\r\n    great authority on the _Phytoptidæ_, and he is much interested\r\n    in hearing about this great spread of attack, but is not able to\r\n    give us better advice, as to practical remedies, than what we\r\n    are already trying. (See also p. 248.)\r\n\r\n    He says very truly, that looking at the winter quarters of the\r\n    mite pests being most especially in the buds, such measures as:—\r\n\r\n    (1) Breaking off and destroying the infested buds.[65] (2)\r\n    Cutting off the infested shoots just above the ground, and so\r\n    getting new shoots. (3) Only using uninfested pieces for\r\n    propagation—could not, he thinks, fail to be of service, if\r\n    carried out carefully. I quite agree with Dr. Nalepa so far as\r\n    that, without these measures, infestation would be worse than it\r\n    is. In a small amount of growth (such as bushes in a private\r\n    garden), I can speak from my own personal experience of having\r\n    sometimes satisfactorily checked the spread of these or similar\r\n    causes of injury by employing dressings. But it is a very\r\n    different matter where blackcurrant bushes are grown by acres\r\n    together; and I greatly doubt whether, even if consideration of\r\n    cost were put aside, it would be within possibility to get this\r\n    wood (or grove) of bushes, so examined and so expurgated of\r\n    evil, as not to leave centres for spread.)\r\n\r\n    It always strikes me as a very curious circumstance that (so far\r\n    as I am aware) the black currant is not affected by this\r\n    _Phytoptus_ on the Continent, or at least in the large part of\r\n    it in which the attacks are noted by Kaltenbach or Taschenberg.\r\n    Do you think it can be that the black currant is there of a\r\n    somewhat different kind which repels _Phytoptus_ attack, just as\r\n    some kinds of American vines are not as subject as others to\r\n    _Phylloxera_? It occurs to me that it may be well worth while to\r\n    import some hundreds of plants and plant them, of course on what\r\n    is considered clean ground, and see what comes of it. I should\r\n    like your views after you have well thought the matter over. I\r\n    cannot expect the expense of an experiment of mine to be borne\r\n    by any Company, but I should much like it trustworthily tried,\r\n    and if you could give me some guidance as to where to apply on\r\n    the Continent, and cost (a rough estimate), I might be able to\r\n    get the plants, and with your permission send a good consignment\r\n    to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 27, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I have to-day heard from Dr. Ritzema Bos about the _Phytoptus\r\n    ribis_, and he tells me that in Holland he knows many localities\r\n    where this infestation is a scourge to fruit-growers, but it is\r\n    always the black currant which is attacked. They do not have it\r\n    there in the red currant, _Ribes rubrum_. He says that he is not\r\n    acquainted with any better remedies than those mentioned in my\r\n    letter, but that he considers it an excellent idea to seek for\r\n    varieties or families of black-currants, _Ribes nigrum_, which\r\n    may be “_Phytoptus_ proof.” He does not himself know positively\r\n    whether there are districts in Holland not attacked by the\r\n    _Phytoptus_, and whether in attacked districts there may be\r\n    varieties that do not suffer. Therefore he is going to ask for\r\n    information on this head from horticulturists and fruit-growers,\r\n    and will write me again. I think it is very kind of him to take\r\n    so much trouble to help us, and from his position I expect he\r\n    will easily obtain whatever information is to be had, and I will\r\n    be sure to let you know. It is very curious about the red\r\n    currant being attacked in some parts of the Continent and not in\r\n    others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 30, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I have this afternoon heard from Professor J. Jablonowski,\r\n    Assistant at the State Entomological Station, Budapest, that he\r\n    “sends now the promised black-currants.” I expect these will be\r\n    supposed “mite-proof” plants, as he says that he hopes they will\r\n    be serviceable for the proposed experiment—but he does not\r\n    explain; only that they have been given to him by his friend,\r\n    the Director of the Horticultural Institute, Desiderius Angyal\r\n    (I do not know what prefix I should write). When the plants\r\n    arrive I propose to divide them (if you please) between yourself\r\n    and Mr. John Speir—it would be exceedingly interesting if there\r\n    really should turn out to be a mite-proof black currant. But\r\n    meanwhile Professor Jablonowski would very much like to have a\r\n    specimen of the mite galls, for he has never seen them. If it\r\n    would not be too much trouble, I should be very greatly obliged\r\n    if you would be kind enough to let me have two or three bits of\r\n    twigs with galls, if any are showing enough now to be\r\n    noticeable, and I would send them on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _December 4, 1897._\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for the supply of galls, which I shall duly send to\r\n    the Professor, and I earnestly hope that he will not infest\r\n    Hungary with them! The consignment came to hand from him\r\n    yesterday evening, but it is in the form of shoots as cuttings,\r\n    so I now send you about half in a registered letter. If the\r\n    pieces root properly I should think it would be best to plant\r\n    them amongst the infested currants—as they are so few it would\r\n    not be much trouble—and there is just a chance that they may be\r\n    mite-proof. I do not myself (much as I regret it) think that\r\n    there is any safety in washes and that sort of treatment, but as\r\n    I write the idea comes into my mind whether, as with us, the\r\n    _Ribes rubrum_ (red currant) seems mite-proof—anything could be\r\n    done by grafting black on red. Would they graft? or is my idea\r\n    quite chimerical? The black currant shoots are var. “bang-up,”\r\n    which suggests England as their original country.\r\n\r\n    I do not know whether you have to do with importing apple fruit,\r\n    but I see from Dr. Fletcher’s (Canadian) Entomological Report\r\n    that there is a newly observed fruit maggot in, I think (without\r\n    special reference), the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 17, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I cannot be sure of your bulb attack without developing the fly,\r\n    but I should conjecture that the mischief was most likely caused\r\n    by the Narcissus fly. This is now known as the _Merodon\r\n    narcissi_, Fab., but from the varieties in colour to which it is\r\n    subject, I believe it has been known under all the following\r\n    specific names: _ephippium_, _transversalis_, _nobilis_,\r\n    _constans_, _ferrugineus_, _flavicans_, and _equestris_.\r\n\r\n    It is a fair-sized two-winged fly, and appears to be (in grub\r\n    state) a severe plague to Narcissus and Daffodil growers in\r\n    Holland, &c., especially in bulbs imported from the South of\r\n    Europe.\r\n\r\n    In Verrall’s list of British Diptera I only find one species of\r\n    _Merodon_ named and that is _equestris_, which on the principle\r\n    mentioned on the preceding page, might be synonymous with all\r\n    the other (?) species. The grubs feed in Narcissus and Daffodil\r\n    bulbs and turn to chrysalides in the ground, but I do not find\r\n    anywhere that there is any known remedial measure. It seems to\r\n    me that the only way if a bed were much infested would be\r\n    literally to trench it, and so turn down the chrysalides. You do\r\n    not mention whether your bulbs are home grown. If they are\r\n    imported, could not you suggest to your “consigner” that unless\r\n    he sent you bulbs without maggots in them, you purposed applying\r\n    elsewhere?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 12, 1898._\r\n\r\n    Excepting one specimen your caterpillars are not yet nearly full\r\n    grown! If you will turn to “Lappet moth” in my Annual Reports\r\n    for 1893 and 1894, you will find “the brutes” figured—perhaps\r\n    get a hint where they may have come from.\r\n\r\n    It was about this attack amongst others that I gave so\r\n    much annoyance to “Entomologists” by recommending that,\r\n    notwithstanding their beauty and rarity, it would be\r\n    highly desirable to make them yet more rare!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Male and female; and caterpillar; also apple twig with leaves eaten\r\n    away—all from life.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—LAPPET MOTH, _GASTROPACHA QUERCIFOLIA_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _December 5, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Do you happen to have seen the Woburn Report containing, amongst\r\n    a good deal of information, an account of results of experiments\r\n    _re_ Black currant mite?

The experiment of moving\r\n    cut down plants, even if steeped in methylated spirit and water,\r\n    has not succeeded.

TEGETMEIER,—I am greatly obliged by what you tell me\r\n    about your intentions as to publishing a book on “The House\r\n    Sparrow,” _Passer domesticus_. My idea is this—that for popular\r\n    use (farmers and gardeners)—the evidence of what the food of the\r\n    house sparrow really is, needs to be put plainly before them by\r\n    means of records of trustworthy investigations of the contents\r\n    of their crops. For this I have been taking the returns of Mr.\r\n    Gurney, and some of Colonel Russell, who used to help me; an\r\n    abstract of the U.S.A. Board of Agricultural Investigations,\r\n    &c., &c.; also from my own Annual Reports, some lists, and\r\n    observations of birds which are named as destroying insects—this\r\n    to show that we do not wholly rely on _Passer domesticus_! With\r\n    other material I propose to make a sort of 8 or 12 page\r\n    “leaflet” or small pamphlet, and send it out gratuitously. I\r\n    believe it would have an enormous circulation, and would not\r\n    interfere with your much more valuable standard book. But I am\r\n    exceedingly desirous to act completely in conjunction with you.\r\n    To me it would be a very great advantage. I quite reckon on\r\n    being violently attacked, but it did me no harm before to be\r\n    threatened to be shot at, also hanged in effigy, and other\r\n    little attentions. Still it was disagreeable!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. C.—HOUSE SPARROW, _PASSER DOMESTICUS_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Miss Ormerod’s case against the House Sparrow or avian rat is briefly\r\ngiven in the following summary, appended to the aforementioned leaflet,\r\nof which nearly 36,000 were printed and issued to applicants:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We find, in addition to what all concerned know too well\r\n    already of the direct and obvious losses from sparrow\r\n    marauding, that there is evidence of the injurious extent to\r\n    which they drive off other birds, as the swallows and martins,\r\n    which are much more helpful on account of their being wholly\r\n    insectivorous; also that, so far from the sparrow’s food\r\n    consisting wholly of insects at any time of the year, even in\r\n    the young sparrows only half has been found to be composed of\r\n    insects; and of the food of the adults, it was found from\r\n    examination that in a large proportion of instances no insects\r\n    at all were present, and of these many were of kinds that are\r\n    helpful to us or harmless. It is well on record that there are\r\n    many kinds of birds which help us greatly by devouring\r\n    insects, and that where sparrows have systematically been\r\n    destroyed for a long course of years other birds have fared\r\n    better for their absence. Attention should also be drawn to\r\n    the enormous powers of increase of this bird, which under not\r\n    only protection, but to some extent absolute fostering, raises\r\n    its numbers so disproportionately as to destroy the natural\r\n    balance.\r\n\r\n    “Here as yet we have no movement beyond our own attempts to\r\n    preserve ourselves, so far as we legally may, from Sparrow\r\n    devastations; but in the United States of America (of the\r\n    evidence of which I have given a part) the Association of the\r\n    American Ornithologists gave their collective recommendation\r\n    that all existing laws protecting the sparrow should be\r\n    repealed, and bounties offered for its destruction; and the\r\n    law protecting the sparrow has been repealed in Massachusetts\r\n    and Michigan. Dr. Hart Merriam, the Ornithologist of the\r\n    U.S.A. Board of Agriculture, also officially recommended\r\n    immediate repeal of all laws affording protection to the\r\n    English sparrow, and enactment of laws making it penal to\r\n    shelter or harbour it; and Professor C. V. Riley, Entomologist\r\n    to the Department, similarly conveyed his views officially as\r\n    to it being a _destructive bird, worthless as an insect\r\n    killer_. In Canada, on October 6, 1888, at the Annual Meeting\r\n    of the Entomological Society of Ontario, Mr. J. Fletcher,\r\n    Entomologist of the Experimental Farms of the Department,\r\n    strongly advocated the destruction of the sparrow; and in\r\n    reply the Hon. C. W. Drury, Minister of Agriculture (who\r\n    attended the meeting as head of the Agricultural Department of\r\n    Ontario), stated ‘that this destructive bird was no longer\r\n    under the protection of the Act of Parliament respecting\r\n    insectivorous birds, and that every one was at liberty to aid\r\n    in reducing its numbers.’ Reasoning on the same grounds as to\r\n    procedure in this country, we believe that similar action is,\r\n    without any reasonable cause for doubt, called for here. The\r\n    amount of the national loss, by reason of ravaged crops and\r\n    serviceable birds driven away, may be estimated, without fear\r\n    of exaggeration, at from one to two millions a year. Much of\r\n    their own protection lies in the hands of farmers themselves;\r\n    and sparrow clubs, well worked, and always bearing in mind\r\n    that it is only this one bird that is earnestly recommended to\r\n    their attention, would probably lessen the load to a bearable\r\n    amount; and we believe that subscriptions, whether local or\r\n    from those who know the desirableness of aiding in the work of\r\n    endeavouring to save the bread of the people from these\r\n    feathered robbers, would be money wisely and worthily spent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. D.—TREE SPARROW, _PASSER MONTANUS_\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn his little book, “The House Sparrow,”[67] Mr. Tegetmeier\r\nwrites:—“There is no species with which _Passer domesticus_ is likely to\r\nbe confounded except the Tree sparrow, _P. montanus_ (the only other\r\nspecies indigenous to this country) which is less numerous and which is\r\nreadily distinguished by its smaller size, being only 5½ instead of 6\r\ninches in length, and by its having black patches in the middle of the\r\nwhite feathers on each side on the neck, and two distinct bands of white\r\nacross the wing in place of one.” “The so-called Hedge-sparrow or\r\nDunnock, _Accentor modularis_, is wrongly named. It is a purely\r\ninsect-eating bird, and neither in its structure, habits nor food is it\r\nclosely related to the House sparrow. It does not occur in large\r\nnumbers, and is highly beneficial as an insect destroyer.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 10, 1897._\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. TEGETMEIER,—Your letter received this morning is a very\r\n    great pleasure to me—in fact, a great relief to my mind, for I\r\n    was truly sorry to feel I might be trespassing on far more\r\n    authoritative work. I should like to shorten my work if I could,\r\n    but when we meet, I hope you will set me right as to condensing\r\n    and all other matters. If we could rout _P. domesticus_ it would\r\n    be a national benefit. Much looking forward to our meeting on\r\n    Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 4, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I think “House Sparrow” shapes up nicely altogether, and I have\r\n    this morning received a letter from Dr. M. E. Oustalet,\r\n    President of the “Comité Ornithologique permanent,” at Paris, to\r\n    say that he has not been able to find any indication of\r\n    destruction of sparrows having taken place by order of\r\n    Government in the districts that I inquired about.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 16, 1897._\r\n\r\n    Application for our leaflet is very satisfactory. The\r\n    Staffordshire County Council has taken up distribution, and the\r\n    farmers and parish authorities are again encouraged to begin\r\n    sparrow clubs. I have experienced tremendous denunciations of my\r\n    own brutality from the Rev. J. E. Walker. I enclose the second,\r\n    as he purposes to relieve his mind further in the “Animal’s\r\n    Friend.” Please not to return it. I returned his book with my\r\n    compliments and thanks for sight of the same, and requested that\r\n    should he desire to make any further remarks relative to the\r\n    leaflet that he would not address them to me, but to you as my\r\n    colleague in the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 21, 1897._\r\n\r\n    In very little more than a week a new impression was needed to\r\n    keep up to demand—and we are making way well with this second\r\n    5,000. Many of the applications are from centres—and great\r\n    satisfaction is often expressed at the information being made\r\n    available. The Agent-General for New Zealand asked for a supply,\r\n    and Mr. Morley, Lord Spencer’s agent, is taking up the matter\r\n    well; and as Lord Spencer appears to steadily set his face\r\n    against sparrows, I hope that when he comes home we shall get\r\n    some support there. A fair proportion of clergymen want copies\r\n    for distribution to parishioners, or for sparrow clubs, which is\r\n    satisfactory—and amongst all the great mass of applications\r\n    there have not, I think, been more than five or six at all\r\n    upholding _P. domesticus_, and these have been mostly quite\r\n    trivial observations.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Morley was in a difficulty about how to keep the birds for\r\n    counting, as in warm weather they got unpleasant. I suggested\r\n    preserving their heads in salt and water—if I remember rightly\r\n    this was how they managed the difficulty in South Australia.\r\n    Altogether I think we are doing well—there are a good many\r\n    inquiries as to the best methods of destroying the bird—but I\r\n    always say that you will deal with this in your work. The good\r\n    folks have not attacked me again personally by letter.\r\n\r\n    I should have liked to write just a short note to the “Field” to\r\n    mention how well the matter has been taken up, but I did not\r\n    feel sure whether you would wish me to do it? Would you think\r\n    well of just mentioning the large demand yourself? On several\r\n    days the applications ran to above a hundred letters. I am\r\n    keeping the letters, for in some there is very practical\r\n    observation as to the great injury done by sparrows—especially\r\n    attacking corn on allotments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 22, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I am trying—if the thing be possible—to rout people out of the\r\n    time-honoured old holes that they creep into—as the emigration\r\n    of the sparrows—also the Maine and Auxerre story. These, I\r\n    think, we have managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[The following is an extract from the “House Sparrow” pamphlet:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “For many years mention has been made, by those who consider\r\n    sparrow preservation desirable, of great disasters following on\r\n    some not clearly detailed methods of extermination, or expulsion\r\n    of the sparrow in the countries of Hungary and Baden, and also\r\n    in the territory of Prussia; and, nearer our own time, in Maine,\r\n    and near Auxerre in France. With regard to the three first\r\n    named, a record will be found in our own ‘Times’ for August 21,\r\n    1861, p. 7.\r\n\r\n    “This gives a translation from the French paper, the ‘Moniteur,’\r\n    of a report on four petitions relative to preservation of small\r\n    birds which had been presented to the French Corps Législatif.\r\n    The report contains much information, but in respect to the\r\n    emigrations of the sparrow because the bird was aware of the\r\n    plots that were being laid against its safety, the statements\r\n    cannot be said to carry any weight. The following extract is\r\n    inserted, as it is important to agriculturists to have a correct\r\n    copy of the baseless statements they are sometimes called on to\r\n    believe. The passage is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “‘Now, if the facts mentioned in the petitions are exact,\r\n    according to the opinion of many this bird ought to stand much\r\n    higher than he is reputed. In fact, it is stated that a price\r\n    having been set upon his head in Hungary and Baden, the\r\n    intelligent _proscrit_ left those countries; but it was soon\r\n    discovered that he alone could manfully contend against the\r\n    cockroaches and the thousand winged insects of the lowlands, and\r\n    the very men who offered a price for his destruction offered a\r\n    still higher price to introduce him again into the country.’ ...\r\n    ‘Frederick the Great had also declared war against the sparrows,\r\n    which did not respect his favourite fruit the cherry. Naturally\r\n    the sparrows could not pretend to resist the conqueror of\r\n    Austria, and they emigrated; but in two years not only were\r\n    there no more cherries, but scarcely any other sort of fruit—the\r\n    caterpillars ate them all up; and the great victor on so many\r\n    fields of battle was happy to sign peace at the cost of a few\r\n    cherries with the reconciliated sparrows,’\r\n\r\n    “With regard to the destruction and consequent results stated to\r\n    have occurred in Maine and near Auxerre, at present our very\r\n    best endeavours have failed to find that the statement of this\r\n    having occurred rests on any authoritative basis; and the only\r\n    definite notice of the subject which we have found is, that in\r\n    the neighbourhood of Auxerre there was an injudicious\r\n    destruction of small birds generally, not only of _Passer\r\n    domesticus_.” See ‘The House Sparrow at Home and Abroad,’ by\r\n    Thomas G.

TEGETMEIER,—But there is a third story—though I name\r\n    this with more reverence than they always do—the New Testament\r\n    allusions translated in our version, the “sparrow.” I find in a\r\n    copy of the “Ecclesiastical Slavonic” Scripture which I have\r\n    here (the authorised edition of the Russian Greek Church) that\r\n    the word is _bird_; in the ordinary modern Russian it is\r\n    sparrow. Unfortunately I do not understand Greek—but this could\r\n    easily be looked up in the Greek Testament. I am trying to find\r\n    a scholar who knows what the respective words for bird and\r\n    sparrow are in Aramaic, which I believe was the dialect of\r\n    Palestine in the time of our Lord. Mr. Rassam, the explorer,\r\n    can, I believe, talk a number of these Eastern dialects, but he\r\n    always told me that he did not enter on them grammatically or\r\n    technically.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _September 3, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I see by a local paper that Miss Carrington’s leaflet, “Spare\r\n    the Sparrow,” is out, and is procurable from the Hon. Sec. of\r\n    the Humanitarian League, 53, Chancery Lane, London, W.C., price\r\n    1d. I have now written to the Hon. Sec., enclosing 8d., and\r\n    requesting him to send six copies to myself, and two to\r\n    yourself. This leaflet, I think, will be spirity. There are only\r\n    a few lines quoted, but if the rest is so discourteous and\r\n    inaccurate it will not be of much value.\r\n\r\n    Amongst applicants for my leaflet, the Duchess of Somerset and\r\n    also Lady Alwyne Compton have asked for copies, which I am glad\r\n    of. If it were “fashionable” not to protect sparrows this would\r\n    go far with some people. I am longing to see the reply leaflet.\r\n    I expect I am roundly abused, but I think it is rather strong to\r\n    head something or other in the “Animal’s Friend” for September\r\n    “God Save the Sparrow.” I expect we shall very likely have Maine\r\n    and Auxerre, and Frederick the Great, and the cherries and\r\n    cockroaches and the whole story resuscitated!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 11, 1897._\r\n\r\n    The Secretary of the Yorkshire Union of Agricultural\r\n    Associations asked for some leaflets, and with his consent I\r\n    have sent him down 2,000 copies, which gives one for each\r\n    member of the Agricultural Clubs or Chambers in the Yorkshire\r\n    Union, and the matter is to be brought before the next\r\n    quarterly meeting, with the view, the Secretary says, of\r\n    seeing about asking the Board of Agriculture to remove _P.\r\n    domesticus_ from the list of protected birds. Mr. Crawford\r\n    wrote me acknowledgment of receipt of the leaflets I sent by\r\n    his desire to the Board of Agriculture, and said that next\r\n    week, when the Secretary returns, they will be laid before the\r\n    Board. I wonder what they will do? Daily applications are\r\n    running from seventeen or eighteen to thirty—and some very\r\n    good. To-day I have one from Smyrna and one from Stavanger,\r\n    Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 19, 1897._\r\n\r\n    The applications are going on so well that I have had to order a\r\n    fourth 5,000 of the leaflets to be printed as soon as can be\r\n    managed, and of these over 2,000 are bespoken. A few days ago\r\n    3,000 were wanted for a Scotch centre, the Agent-General for New\r\n    South Wales will send out 500, and other distributions are\r\n    floating about; I think this is not bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 16, 1897._\r\n\r\n    As you will see by the enclosed, I am now working on the\r\n    twenty-first thousand. I have only about fifty copies left, and\r\n    Mr. Newman has sent out some of the twenty-second thousand, so I\r\n    think that we are doing well. One of the largest amounts asked\r\n    for lately has been 1,000 for the Lancashire County Council, and\r\n    also a little while ago Lady Aberdeen wrote for a small supply\r\n    from the Government House, Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 27, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I hope you will be pleased to hear that I have brought our\r\n    sparrow work under the notice of Mr. [now Sir Ernest] Clarke,\r\n    Secretary, Royal Agricultural Society—I hope in a way to advance\r\n    our work. I sent him a couple of the twenty-second thousand,\r\n    with a sort of report letter, giving some points. Mr. Clarke has\r\n    replied very courteously that he is much obliged for my\r\n    interesting letter, which he will lay before the Society’s\r\n    Zoological Committee. Also that, as he is occasionally asked for\r\n    the leaflet, it might “save me (E. A. O.) unnecessary\r\n    correspondence” if he were able to send copies to inquirers. I\r\n    am delighted to follow up this suggestion—for practically it is\r\n    the Royal Agricultural Society distributing for us, and thus\r\n    giving their marked approval. I wonder what will come of the\r\n    Zoological Committee’s consideration. As the President of the\r\n    Society has such an exceedingly bad opinion of the sparrow, I\r\n    hope we may get some good colleagueship. I am perpetually asked\r\n    how to destroy sparrows, but I refer the inquirers to you. I am\r\n    longing to hear when your book will come out—surely it will have\r\n    a good circulation. I am well advanced now in the twenty-second\r\n    thousand, and the information is well spread, for we have a\r\n    splendid notice—much more than a column—in the “Madras Mail,”\r\n    and I have had two applications from scientific U.S.A. centres.\r\n\r\n    I am still dispensing knowledge about the evil ways of _P.\r\n    domesticus_ so steadily that I have had to order a sixth\r\n    impression.\r\n\r\n    The store of letters grew to such a size that a week or two ago\r\n    I sent them (excepting about seventy which were to some degree\r\n    private) in a great parcel to Mr. Janson, and I have arranged\r\n    with him that this great mass, perhaps of 1,500 or 1,600\r\n    letters, should be sorted out into those that are merely\r\n    applications for leaflets and those which contain any\r\n    information.\r\n\r\n    The overwork and worry was too much for me, joined to my bad\r\n    fall, and I was very far indeed from well for some time with\r\n    gout and exhausting troubles, but I am better, and regaining\r\n    strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 14, 1898._\r\n\r\n    I most truly think it a great distinction that my name should be\r\n    associated [on the title-page of “The House Sparrow”] with that\r\n    of an Ornithologist of such world-wide reputation as yourself,\r\n    and as it is your wish I very heartily agree. The only\r\n    alteration I would suggest is that the word “Miss” should be\r\n    removed. I do not like the word if it is not quite needed; and\r\n    would it not be well to add a reference to my being an\r\n    authorised agricultural worker? It may protect me from some\r\n    “mendacities,” and, a better reason, show that we are attentive\r\n    to all three of the points (Ornithology, Entomology, and\r\n    Agriculture) on which anti-passerine observation rests.\r\n\r\n    I like your frontispiece (figs. C and D, kindly lent by Mr.\r\n    Tegetmeier) very much. It is very pretty as well as very useful.\r\n    When your book appears I shall like to get some copies to send\r\n    to some of my own friends, British and extra-British.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 15, 1899._\r\n\r\n    It was a great pleasure to me to see “The House Sparrow”\r\n    yesterday, followed this morning by your kind and cordial\r\n    letter. I like your book exceedingly; it appears to me to be\r\n    exactly what is needed. Chapter IV. [Diminishing the Sparrow\r\n    Plague] meets the want which is greatly felt, and your voice\r\n    being raised against poisoning will do good. I propose to send\r\n    samples to the Agents-General of South Australia and New\r\n    Zealand, where the “Avian Rats” are special pests; also to Mr.\r\n    McKinnon, for the benefit of the Republic of Uruguay.\r\n\r\n    I think one or two would be well placed in the hands of the\r\n    Department of Agriculture, U.S.A. I suppose that in an obviously\r\n    much-needed matter like this it is hopeless to expect our Board\r\n    of Agriculture to do anything. But I have, besides the above,\r\n    several centres of work which I hope to make use of.\r\n\r\n    I do hope that your book will have the success that it deserves,\r\n    and be of infinite benefit. I like it thoroughly—its pretty\r\n    dress, the good figures and readable type on strong paper; it is\r\n    a National gift, in your good and authoritative working up of\r\n    the subject, and I feel myself honoured to be associated with\r\n    you in the good work and the pummelling, which I dare say we\r\n    shall get more of!\r\n\r\n    With my very kind regards and remembrances, believe me,\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

ALBANS,\r\n                                                    _April 2, 1897_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,—From your description of the elm-bark attack, I should\r\n    certainly think that the maggots were those of the Elm-bark\r\n    beetle, the _destructor_. If you do not feel certain after this\r\n    hint as to the nature of the infestation, and will send me a\r\n    little piece of bark, I will with pleasure examine it and report\r\n    to you. This infestation does not injure the timber of the tree.\r\n    The burrowings are mostly between the bark and the wood, though\r\n    necessarily there are a number of borings through the bark,\r\n    caused by the entrance and exit of the beetles. It would be\r\n    desirable to fell the trees, and peel off the bark and burn it.\r\n    The timber would be quite good (so far as this matter is\r\n    concerned) but if the bark is left, the maggots will in due\r\n    course develop to beetles and fly off to continue mischief\r\n    elsewhere. Further I would suggest that you should direct your\r\n    wood-superintendents to examine whether other elms show\r\n    shot-like holes in their bark—the sign of the presence of the\r\n    infestation. From your mention of the locality of the trees\r\n    being rather damp, I should conjecture that the trees were not\r\n    in absolutely perfect health, and this is the state of things\r\n    the beetle prefers for its attack. Injured boughs, or moderately\r\n    recently-fallen boughs, or, above all, felled elm trunks in\r\n    which there is still sap, but not flow enough to stifle the\r\n    little maggots, are the very headquarters of infestation, and it\r\n    is quite worth while to have such felled trunks peeled and the\r\n    bark destroyed, or they will be the nurseries of great mischief.\r\n    If you will supply me with more detail I will with great\r\n    pleasure give my very best attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Beetle, much magnified (from “Forest Protection,” by W. R. Fisher);\r\n    workings in elm bark—from life.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—ELM-BARK BEETLE, _SCOLYTUS DESTRUCTOR_, OLIV.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 5, 1897._\r\n\r\n    The little larvæ came safely yesterday and the specimens of bark\r\n    this morning. Necessarily when the attack has been going on so\r\n    long the burrows intersect each other so very much that they\r\n    cease to show the typical patterning or tracks, but I do not see\r\n    any reason at all to doubt that this is attack of the very great\r\n    elm-pest, the Elm-bark beetle. With regard to its infestation of\r\n    other trees besides elm, I have no knowledge of its ever\r\n    attacking either oak or ash, but on careful search I find that\r\n    one German writer records it as “sometimes” attacking the ash. I\r\n    greatly doubt this having been observed in our country. Our\r\n    ashes have, however, a bark beetle which tunnels much in the\r\n    same manner between the bark and wood, and of which the presence\r\n    may similarly be known by the shot-like holes in the bark. But\r\n    you would distinguish the difference in pattern of gallery at a\r\n    glance on raising the bark. As in the figure given, the\r\n    mother-gallery is branched. This Ash-bark beetle, _Hylesinus\r\n    fraxini_, does not do very much harm, for it chiefly attacks\r\n    felled trunks, or sometimes sickly or damaged trunks and boughs.\r\n    It is not to be compared in its ravages with the _Scolytus_,\r\n    well-named _destructor_. I am not aware of this ever attacking\r\n    oak.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Workings, showing forked “mother gallery,” with larval galleries from\r\n    the sides.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—TUNNELS OF THE ASH-BARK BEETLE, _HYLESINUS FRAXINI_, FAB.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 12, 1899._\r\n\r\n    You have certainly two kinds of bark attack present in the\r\n    specimens which you send me, but without the beetles I am not\r\n    able to say at all what species may have been doing the\r\n    mischief. I can say quite certainly that I do not see any signs\r\n    of the presence of the _Hylesinus fraxini_ (Ash-bark beetle),\r\n    but I have never, so far as I remember, seen the very long,\r\n    narrow borings, hardly wider than a thread of silk, which are a\r\n    good deal represented on the inner surface of one of your pieces\r\n    of bark.\r\n\r\n    There are two or three grubs in fairly good condition which I\r\n    have gently inserted into a burrow in the little bit of bark and\r\n    have put carefully aside in the little box, and if these\r\n    develop, we shall then know what we have to deal with. Perhaps\r\n    you may be able to secure some beetles in a month or two; it\r\n    would be of interest to make out the attack with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _November 7, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I have very carefully examined your beetle and find that it is\r\n    _Hylesinus crenatus_, sometimes known as the “Large Ash-bark\r\n    beetle” to distinguish it from _Hylesinus fraxini_, the\r\n    “Ash-bark” or the “Small Ash-bark beetle.” The life history of\r\n    each kind is stated to be the same, and I think, if I remember\r\n    rightly, that some time ago, perhaps a year or so, in the course\r\n    of our occasional correspondence, we have gone into the history\r\n    of the _fraxini_, but if not I should have pleasure in either\r\n    looking up the account in my Manual and sending the pages to you\r\n    or condensing the points.\r\n\r\n    There appears to me to be this difference in method of larval\r\n    proceedings: that whereas in the case of _fraxini_ the parent\r\n    galleries are formed somewhat in the shape of a T with a short\r\n    stem and long arms to the top, and the larval galleries placed\r\n    at right angles to the others (fig. 36), so far as I understand\r\n    this form is not followed by _crenatus_ fig. 38).\r\n\r\n    The beetle obviously pierces the bark, for the orifice\r\n    is visible; and in or under the bark there are the\r\n    mother-galleries, but I do not find the larval galleries\r\n    feathering as it were from these, and the figure before me gives\r\n    the idea of the body of larvæ having by their united attack\r\n    cleared a flat space from which they have continued their\r\n    solitary tunnels. Perhaps in cutting up your trees you may come\r\n    on some of these markings. It is said that there are two\r\n    generations in the year, of which the flight time of one is in\r\n    April and of the other in October. This species frequents oak as\r\n    well as ash, which is an important consideration, and I find it\r\n    noted as frequenting old trees. These are the main points which\r\n    I see about the history. I should think that if you find the\r\n    trees which you have felled much infested, it would be a good\r\n    thing to strip the bark off and burn it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Beetle, with wings expanded, and one wing-case drawn only in\r\n    outline, to show lower part of wing; 2, beetle as usually\r\n    seen—magnified; 3, smaller and paler variety; also lines showing\r\n    natural length.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 37.—GREATER ASH-BARK BEETLE, _HYLESINUS CRENATUS_, FAB.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 38.—PIECE OF ASH-BARK, SHOWING MOTHER GALLERIES OF _HYLESINUS\r\n    CRENATUS_ ON THE INNER SIDE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _June 25, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged to you for all the great trouble which\r\n    you have been good enough to take about the Ash-bark beetles,\r\n    including your letter of the 23rd and the box of specimens\r\n    received to-day. Some of the workings are quite certainly of _H.\r\n    fraxini_. One bit catches the eye at a glance as showing quite\r\n    typical galleries. In the long strip the workings are not so\r\n    clearly distinguishable. According to descriptions or comparison\r\n    with other specimens they appear to me of both kinds. But I\r\n    really cannot think of giving you further trouble. We have all\r\n    that is needed to make out a good, sound account, and I hope, if\r\n    all be well, to do justice to the subject in my next Annual\r\n    Report, and that you will be satisfied with my working up of the\r\n    points of the infestation.\r\n\r\n    With renewed hearty thanks, yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

ALBANS,\r\n                                                _February 17, 1897_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,—My work is chiefly on injurious insects, so I am\r\n    afraid I am not qualified to give you the exact name of this\r\n    curious collection of cement-like pupa-cases. Still I may say\r\n    that your description most resembles those of the Mason bee, a\r\n    kind of _Osmia_ which constructs cells of a plaster formed of\r\n    little morsels of stone, earth, &c., and then fills them with\r\n    food and lays an egg on it, walls up the cell, and begins\r\n    another. The grub in due course hatches and feeds, and goes\r\n    through its changes to the perfect bee—and somehow or other\r\n    manages to make its exit. These cells are sometimes made on\r\n    walls, in parties of as many as a dozen (as shown in a figure\r\n    before me), but as I said, I am not a “specialist” on\r\n    _Hymenoptera_ (Bees and Wasps), so I would not like to express a\r\n    decided opinion. Your mention of the Roman coin found near the\r\n    Severn cliffs is very interesting, for it was quite inexplicable\r\n    to my father how it happened that, whilst coins are just the\r\n    things often found in such great plenty amongst Roman remains in\r\n    the pottery, bones, &c., of which there was such quantity in the\r\n    site of the Summer Station of the Augustan Legion from Cærwent\r\n    on the Sedbury cliffs, we absolutely did not _have_ a single\r\n    coin. Circumstances since we left have made me think that the\r\n    word I have underlined may be more correct than that none were\r\n    found. On one occasion it chanced I went when the ditch-diggers\r\n    were at their dinners, and under a little shelter of turf (which\r\n    naturally I inspected) I found a very nice little Samian cup. No\r\n    more were reported as found; but after we left I heard of a box\r\n    being in one of the lofts over the stables, addressed to myself,\r\n    which when opened was found to contain more of these Samian\r\n    cups, and also geological specimens from the cliffs. Of course I\r\n    wrote down at once, but (perhaps equally of course) by that time\r\n    the box had vanished. Your letter of this morning recalled all\r\n    this to me, and made me think that very likely the domestic\r\n    collector of curiosities who appropriated the Samian cups also\r\n    made a little collection of the coins, whose total absence\r\n    appeared so surprising. This is a very long story, but I thought\r\n    it might be of some interest to you.\r\n\r\n    I suppose most of our old work-people are gone?\r\n\r\n    Might I venture to trouble you, in case you should be good\r\n    enough some day to find time to write, kindly to let me know\r\n    whether my father and mother’s grave (vault) just below the high\r\n    bank with the pathway on the top in Tidenham Churchyard (plate\r\n    VII.) is in proper repair? If anything is requisite I think you\r\n    would likely be so very good as to tell me, and to whom I should\r\n    apply to do the work. Trusting you will forgive the intrusion on\r\n    your time of such a long letter, I beg to remain, yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

General Secretary, Hastings\r\n               and St. Leonards Natural History Society._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST.

Blomfield that these curiously\r\n    formed damsons, of which you have forwarded me such excellent\r\n    specimens, owe the galled growth to the attack of a parasite\r\n    fungus. They are what you called popularly Bladder plums, or\r\n    Pocket plums (fig. 39), and the cause of this extraordinary\r\n    growth is the presence of the fungus _Exoascus pruni_. I do not\r\n    myself work on Fungi, so I should not have considered myself\r\n    qualified to give you trustworthy information, but I see in\r\n    Professor Marshall Ward’s good account of this attack, that,\r\n    besides reproduction taking place by means of the spores\r\n    carrying the disease from tree to tree, he mentions that the\r\n    fungus can carry on its existence from year to year by means of\r\n    its mycelium in the branches. Consequently much pruning back, as\r\n    well as collecting and burning the “pockets,” is needed to\r\n    combat the attack to any serviceable extent. I am not troubling\r\n    you with details, for you would find them so well entered on in\r\n    Ward’s useful little book, of which I gave the name yesterday to\r\n    Mr. Blomfield, that I think you would prefer them in his\r\n    wording. Hoping I may have assisted you a little in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 39.—POCKET OR BLADDER PLUM INFLATED AND DISTORTED BY THE FUNGOID\r\n    ATTACK OF _EXOASCUS PRUNI_ (After Sorauer).\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 19, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am greatly obliged to you for the kind thought of sending me\r\n    the photo of the Bladder plums. This shows the difference\r\n    between the healthy and the diseased fruit so well that if I had\r\n    not secured a figure of the diseased growth I think I should\r\n    have asked your permission to copy part for my next Annual\r\n    Report. This assuredly is not an insect attack. Still, as it may\r\n    very often give rise to much perplexity, I thought that (with\r\n    due explanation) there could be no objection to including your\r\n    good contribution, and I hope that when in due time you receive\r\n    your “contributor’s copy” you will not disapprove.\r\n\r\n    About Dr. Nalepa’s publications; I dare not offer to lend them,\r\n    for all I have are copies presented successively during a long\r\n    course of years, and if any mishap occurred, I should be in a\r\n    difficult position. But if you have not yet applied to them,\r\n    Messrs. W. Wesley & Son would be more likely to help you than\r\n    anybody I am acquainted with. They would almost certainly be\r\n    able to give you the titles of the successive publications and\r\n    prices, and also procure for you such as are published. At one\r\n    time I worked a great deal on vegetable galls, _Cynips_ galls\r\n    chiefly, but _Phytoptus_ galls I have always found so very\r\n    troublesome in several points of view that I have never worked\r\n    on them more than I can help.

There are very\r\n    many infestations to potato of caterpillars, nearly allied to\r\n    what you will, I think, very likely know well as the “Turnip\r\n    grub.” These are so numerous that it would be quite hopeless for\r\n    me to endeavour to name merely from description and the\r\n    chrysalides; and even with the caterpillar it would have been\r\n    difficult (though I would with pleasure have tried), on account\r\n    of some of these pests greatly resembling each other, and also\r\n    some (identical grubs) altering their colours completely as they\r\n    moult. I should have been glad to help you, but as these\r\n    creatures are now turning to chrysalides the attack is\r\n    presumably nearly over for the present.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—For general use in an attack of this kind the spray that\r\n    you have been using, which is very nearly equivalent to the\r\n    U.S.A. kerosene emulsion, is probably about as good as you could\r\n    try; for I conjecture that you might not like to try\r\n    “Paris-green”? Possibly this would not answer, and for various\r\n    reasons—it being a ground crop as well as the tuber a food\r\n    crop—it might not be desirable; still, I just name it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 4, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am obliged by the fresh specimens of caterpillars received\r\n    this morning from your agent, Mr. Carswell, and from these and\r\n    the moths coming out to-day from the chrysalides previously sent\r\n    me, I am able to say that the larvæ are those of the _Plusia\r\n    gamma_ moth, popularly known as the Silver Y-moth. I am not\r\n    aware of these caterpillars having been recorded as injurious to\r\n    potato leafage, excepting in the year 1892, when I had\r\n    information of two attacks to this crop, in both instances from\r\n    caterpillars migrating from clover. It is too late to-night to\r\n    give you a detailed account, but I write now, as you will be\r\n    interested to have the identification as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Eggs; 2, caterpillar; 3, chrysalis in cocoon; 4, moth.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 40.—GAMMA OR SILVER Y-MOTH, _PLUSIA GAMMA_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _August 5, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Your potato attack is, as I mentioned last evening, caused by\r\n    the caterpillar of the Silver Y-moth, so named from a small\r\n    bright mark on the fore-wings, in shape like the English Y or\r\n    the Greek _Gamma_. The moth is about half an inch in the spread\r\n    of the fore-wings, which have a satiny lustre and are varied\r\n    with rich coppery, as well as grey and brown, marks. The hinder\r\n    wings are greyish, with a brown border. The caterpillars are\r\n    fairly recognisable by being what are called “half-loopers.”\r\n    Having only two pairs of sucker feet beneath the body (besides\r\n    the customary claw feet) they form a slight arch when they walk.\r\n    The attack is occasionally very destructive and is one of those\r\n    which we have proof of having been blown to us, in moth\r\n    condition, from the Continent; and, from some information which\r\n    has come to my hands since I received your letter, I think it is\r\n    not at all unlikely such may be the case now, with another kind\r\n    of crop. The caterpillars feed on many plants, those of the\r\n    cabbage and turnip kind especially; also on _Leguminosæ_, as\r\n    peas and beans. Sugar beet they are destructively partial to. I\r\n    should not at all think that the attack was likely to recur to\r\n    potatoes, or that, as the infestation is now past its\r\n    destructive stage, it was worth troubling yourselves about. If\r\n    you should desire more about it than I can easily condense into\r\n    a moderate letter space, you would find a careful account of the\r\n    attack, with a good figure, in my sixteenth Annual Report on\r\n    Injurious Insects.

ALBANS, ENGLAND.\r\n                                                    _March 6, 1889._\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR RILEY,—We have got a flour caterpillar in\r\n    England, newly arrived in the last two years, which is so very\r\n    troublesome and injurious where it establishes itself that I\r\n    should like to place a short account of it in your hands, hoping\r\n    that at your leisure (I should rather say at your best\r\n    convenience, for leisure you have none) you may kindly tell me\r\n    whether you have it in the U.S.A., and, if so, whether you\r\n    manage to keep it in check. The caterpillars were first observed\r\n    in Europe in 1877 by Dr. Jul. Kuhn, of Halle, doing much\r\n    mischief during the process of grinding some American wheat. The\r\n    imagines from these larvæ were placed by Dr. Kuhn in the hands\r\n    of Professor Zeller, who considered them to be _Ephestia_ of a\r\n    species previously undescribed, and they were named by him\r\n    _kuhniella_ (fig. 41) specifically after their observer. All\r\n    this most likely you know well, but it is the appearance of this\r\n    “pest” here which I am more particularly writing to you about.\r\n    In 1887 the caterpillars did great harm in some large stores in\r\n    London, and last year the attack established itself in a\r\n    wheat-flour steam-mill in the North of England. The great harm\r\n    caused is by reason of the caterpillars “felting” up the meal or\r\n    flour by the quantity of web which they spin in it. They feed,\r\n    of course, but this is not so injurious as working up the flour\r\n    together, as thus they clog the mill apparatus to a very serious\r\n    extent. I have much reduced their numbers by getting the manager\r\n    of the steam-mill to turn on steam to scald them; and cleaning,\r\n    whitewashing, and some use of paraffin have done good. The real\r\n    cure would be to change the material ground. If we could use\r\n    ryemeal for a few weeks we could clear out effectually this\r\n    wheat-flour-feeding caterpillar. Unfortunately, however, the\r\n    delicate apparatus of our recently arranged wheat “roller” mills\r\n    does not allow of this. One point that would help us in\r\n    preventive measures would be to know where the attack comes\r\n    from. I am told it is a “scourge” amongst the flour (or rather\r\n    the meal, as it prefers the more branny parts) in wheat from\r\n    Russia and Hungary at the Mediterranean ports, so I am making\r\n    inquiries; but Dr. Lindeman is not aware of this attack having\r\n    been noticed in Russia. Under these circumstances I thought that\r\n    I would write to you about it, and if you are acquainted with\r\n    this moth and the larval working, and, still more, if you know\r\n    how to destroy it, I should feel greatly favoured and obliged by\r\n    any information that you may kindly give. I believe that unless\r\n    it has very recently been placed on your American lists of\r\n    _Lepidoptera_ it is not noted as known there, and I am trying to\r\n    persuade myself that it is not all selfishness which makes me\r\n    trouble you thus, but that if by any possibility you may not\r\n    chance to have heard of the serious nature of the work of these\r\n    larvæ, you may care to have a few lines about them. The moth is\r\n    about ¾ in. in spread of the fore-wings, which are of pale grey\r\n    with darker transverse markings; the hinder wings remarkable for\r\n    their whitish semi-transparency with a darker line from the\r\n    point along a part of the fore edge. The larvæ, when full-grown,\r\n    as far as I see, are about five-eighths of an inch long. You\r\n    will not care to have full description, but they have surprising\r\n    instinct for travelling, and amazing strength. One that I\r\n    watched to test this power escaped from under a little\r\n    smooth-edged cardboard frame which I had placed on a woollen\r\n    cloth on a quite flat table and pressed down with a one pound\r\n    weight.\r\n\r\n    I hope before long to forward my twelfth Report for your\r\n    acceptance and that it may meet your approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _June 22, 1889._\r\n\r\n    I have not until to-day been able to find time to study your\r\n    interesting and instructive Report (which reached me a little\r\n    while ago), and now after my best thanks I hasten to offer some\r\n    observations about our use over here of the word paraffin—see p.\r\n    104 of your Report. So far as I know or can learn, the different\r\n    oils sold under the name of paraffin, kerosene, or crystal oil,\r\n    only differ from each other by reason of treatment to secure\r\n    various degrees of purity or refinement. The common paraffin oil\r\n    is the coarsest; kerosene I understand is a little more refined,\r\n    and a trifle higher in price; and crystal oil—or (as it is\r\n    sometimes described in the trade) “A1 Crystal Oil”—is limpid\r\n    like water, and the purest of all. I do not know why, but\r\n    kerosene is a name little used here. Paraffin is certainly not a\r\n    correct term for the fluid form, but this fluid or oil is used\r\n    so enormously compared to the solid paraffin that the appended\r\n    word oil necessary for correct description is usually omitted as\r\n    being understood. I quite feel it is a loose and inaccurate\r\n    plan, but so the matter stands. In the same number of my Annual\r\n    Report from which you quote—namely, that for 1884 published\r\n    1885—at pp. 66-67, is a recipe for a mixture of soft soap with\r\n    “paraffin or any other mineral oil.” It has been thoroughly\r\n    tried over here, and found very useful. If you should think fit\r\n    to experiment with it I should greatly like to know results.\r\n\r\n    A single report of appearance of Hessian fly (fig. 15) here has\r\n    been sent me on June 13—with specimens accompanying—full grown\r\n    but still in larval condition. These were on lower shoots of\r\n    wheat of which the plant was then coming into ear at Revell’s\r\n    Hall near Hertford—the farm on which Hessian fly was first\r\n    observed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 September 23, 1889.\r\n\r\n    It was very kind of you to spare time to write to me before\r\n    leaving England, and I well know how very much occupied you must\r\n    have been, so must not be selfish enough to say how much I\r\n    regretted not being able to have both the pleasure and the great\r\n    benefit of a little conversation with you.\r\n\r\n    I beg to place in your hands the little brochure which I am now\r\n    issuing on one of the consequences of warble presence, and might\r\n    I ask Mr. L. O. Howard’s acceptance of the other copy? You will\r\n    see I have tried to condense the points of the subject into a\r\n    space that workers would not be frightened at. It would be a\r\n    great satisfaction to me if the inquiry met with your approval,\r\n    and if you should judge fit to forward the cause of prevention\r\n    in your country, your high authority would be a great help in\r\n    strengthening my hands here. If you care to have a packet of the\r\n    leaflets for distribution it would be only a pleasure to me to\r\n    send some for your acceptance.\r\n\r\n    I have just seen with great pleasure that the Association of\r\n    Economic Entomologists has been formed, and that they have\r\n    elected the highest representative of the important work as\r\n    their First President. This is a great satisfaction to me, and I\r\n    hope ere long I may have the honour of being enrolled amongst\r\n    its members.\r\n\r\n    You pay me a compliment in saying you would care to have an\r\n    occasional contribution of mine in your valuable “Insect Life.”\r\n    If I had anything that I thought would be of sufficient interest\r\n    to send, I would very gladly do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here a contribution on the “Shot-borer Beetle” (Appendix D) followed,\r\nwhich was published by Professor Riley. See also page 199.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 10, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I must take up a little of your valuable time in offering my\r\n    best thanks for the exceedingly interesting transmission,\r\n    received through your kindness this morning. Your own “Insect\r\n    Life,” 3 pts.; “The Root Knot disease”; and Mr. Koebele’s\r\n    “Australian Thrips” are all very valuable contributions to my\r\n    library, and I greatly wish I were able to reciprocate more\r\n    worthily. There is one point in reply to which, if you are quite\r\n    willing, I should much like to be allowed to insert a few lines.\r\n    It is to the paragraph headed “Traps for the Winter Moth\r\n    Useless,” p. 289, of March No. of “Insect Life.” Mr. R.\r\n    McLachlan is mentioned as having stated that traps which aim at\r\n    destruction of the males of the _Cheimatobia brumata_, Winter\r\n    moth (fig. 30) are useless, as enough will remain to fertilize\r\n    the winged females. This I should have conjectured to be a\r\n    well-known fact—but it is not this point which we are in any way\r\n    working on, in any of the prevention details with which I am\r\n    myself acquainted. Our difficulty, as you will see mentioned in\r\n    my thirteenth Report, if you will kindly turn to p. 67, is the\r\n    transportation of the females in the act of pairing by the\r\n    winged males to the trees. This is a point much observed in this\r\n    country, and I have to-day once again had my attention drawn to\r\n    this difficulty in the matter of prevention, by a Somersetshire\r\n    correspondent who in confirmation of his observation has\r\n    preserved the pair in his collection. It is solely to meet this\r\n    difficulty that we use tarred boards and lights in any\r\n    preventive operations with which I am connected. I do not see\r\n    the “Gardeners’ Chronicle,” and I am not in communication with\r\n    Mr. McLachlan or I would have replied in my own country and\r\n    given the necessary explanations, but, if you approve, I should\r\n    much like to be allowed to insert the above observations,\r\n    otherwise the various Superintendents and myself might appear to\r\n    your readers (whose good opinion I should like to merit) as\r\n    wonderfully ignorant of what I believe is a well-known fact.\r\n\r\n    We have now formed a kind of Society Conference with\r\n    Experimental Committee of some of our best orchard growers in\r\n    the West of England for the purpose of themselves experimenting,\r\n    and reporting to the frequently recurring meetings—as to the\r\n    effects of Paris-green, London-purple, &c. At last our people\r\n    are roused to feel that “greasing” will not do everything.\r\n\r\n    I shall look with exceeding interest to the result of your\r\n    _Hypoderma_ or _œstrus_ (Warble and Botfly) experiments. I\r\n    sincerely hope that you will be able to rear the imago.\r\n\r\n    I have been greatly disturbed (and am consequently not writing\r\n    you in as good form as I could wish) by a report being published\r\n    in several of our London papers that I had been thrown from a\r\n    carriage and met with serious injuries. This is altogether\r\n    erroneous, but the many applications, and much writing and\r\n    wiring to get the press to stop the report, has been indeed\r\n    disturbing, and it has wasted me much time.\r\n\r\n    With kind regards and all good wishes from my sister and myself,\r\n    pray believe me, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _To Dr. L. O. Howard, Entomologist U.S. Department of Agriculture,\r\n                              Washington._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                                    _July 26, 1894_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. HOWARD,—I do not myself know what arrangements the\r\n    Royal Agricultural Society of England made with John Curtis.[68]\r\n\r\n    In the “Gardeners’ Chronicle” for October 18, 1862, however, I\r\n    find at p. 983, vol. iii., the following remarks in a short\r\n    notice of the decease of John Curtis, which I transcribe in case\r\n    they should be of interest. After mentioning that he had for\r\n    many years been engaged in investigating the habits of insects\r\n    injurious to farm and garden produce, the writer continues:\r\n    “These he published in detached memoirs in the ‘Gardeners’\r\n    Chronicle’ under the signature of ‘Ruricola,’ and in the\r\n    ‘Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society.’ At a subsequent\r\n    period they were collected into a single volume and published\r\n    under the title of ‘Farm Insects.’ It was chiefly on account of\r\n    the value of these articles that Mr. Curtis was awarded a\r\n    pension from the Civil List which was augmented about three\r\n    years since on account of the sad loss of sight which he\r\n    experienced.” The note is given as quoted from the “Athenæum,”\r\n    and in case you should not have references to Curtis having the\r\n    pension he so well earned, I thought you might care for the\r\n    extract.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for letting me know of Professor Riley’s visit to\r\n    England; I greatly desire to have a long talk with him. He may\r\n    have comfort in having such a skilled successor. Special\r\n    thanks also for your paper on the Army worm, _Leucania\r\n    unipunctata_.[69] It is such a good one, and the remedies so\r\n    practicable. I hope to quote from this presently—duly\r\n    acknowledged. You speak very truly as to information not being\r\n    asked until the attack is so set up that much hope of victory\r\n    over it is lost.\r\n\r\n    I should very much like to be allowed to offer my best regards,\r\n    and respectful expression of my admiration of their good work,\r\n    to the many kind friends who will be present at the Economic\r\n    Entomology meeting in August, together with my hearty good\r\n    wishes for the prosperity of the Association and its members. I\r\n    owe much to the kindness of my U.S.A. colleagues and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 17, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I hasten to thank you for your letter received this afternoon,\r\n    setting me right as to the origin of the bran-mash and\r\n    Paris-green application for killing “cutworms” (leather\r\n    jackets). I should indeed be sorry not to give credit in the\r\n    right quarter, and you may rest assured that the first time I\r\n    have to mention the matter this shall be set right. I am sorry\r\n    also on my account not to have known that this remedy was in\r\n    use, and now you have pointed the way I shall be very glad to\r\n    look the matter up. Through the kind liberality (public as well\r\n    as private), with which I have always been treated by your\r\n    country, I have a truly valuable library of your U.S.A. works,\r\n    from which I often and gratefully profit.\r\n\r\n    I am looking forward very much to getting your paper on Economic\r\n    Entomology, but at present I have only seen pleasant notices of\r\n    it, and I am greatly desirous to read it _in extenso_. Attention\r\n    to this subject is spreading very satisfactorily on the\r\n    Continent. I am now in communication with Professor J.\r\n    Jablonowski, of the Entomological staff of the Hungarian\r\n    Government Department of Agriculture at Budapest. He is doing\r\n    very careful and good work on _Thysanoptera_ (Thrips). Also at\r\n    Helsingfors (Finland) I hear from Dr. Enzio Reuter that they are\r\n    contemplating arranging an Entomological Station, and I hope I\r\n    may be in communication.\r\n\r\n    I am now beginning to pass my eighteenth Report through the\r\n    press. One of the interesting appearances of the past season has\r\n    been a widely spread outbreak of _Charæas graminis_, Antler moth\r\n    (p. 104). This was more or less in seven contiguous counties in\r\n    the South-west of Scotland, and though not remarkable in itself,\r\n    yet, as there were one or two competent observers on the spot,\r\n    some good notes were secured, especially as to presence of\r\n    parasites, which I hope in due time you may find of some\r\n    interest. There was much presence of a _Mermis_ in one district.\r\n    Out of a single larva I withdrew in three pieces about 18 inches\r\n    of thread-worm. Also there was presence of “flacherie” and some\r\n    _Tachina_ larvæ. Dr. Ritzema Bos, of Wageningen, who is always\r\n    most kind in colleagueship, helps me much about identification.\r\n\r\n    I hope to have a good deal to say about _Heterodera schachtii_\r\n    (an eel-worm enemy of hop-roots). Different kinds of eel-worms\r\n    seem each year to be showing themselves more, and I am greatly\r\n    desiring to find whether the _schachtii_ may not have come to\r\n    the roots of oats here as well as in Holland. The Great\r\n    Tortoiseshell butterfly, _Vanessa polychloros_ (fig. 13), which\r\n    is not common in this country, made a destructive appearance on\r\n    elms and cherry leafage in one locality in Hants. And not far\r\n    from Lymington was a destructive attack in one wheatfield of the\r\n    caterpillars of a small moth, which ate out the heart of the\r\n    young plant and was utterly ruinous. I cannot find the kind of\r\n    attack on record (that is from a _Lepidopterous_ butterfly or\r\n    moth, larva), and we are all perplexed as to species. There\r\n    seems little doubt that it is a _Miana_, and it appears to me\r\n    most like _expolita_, but none of us contrived to rear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 23, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I have been long in your debt for a letter, but sometimes it is\r\n    very difficult to keep all work in hand, and I am sure you will\r\n    forgive me. I had been endeavouring before your letter on Warble\r\n    came to hand, and have since also been trying in some of what\r\n    appeared the most likely quarters to gain information whether\r\n    the form of attack which you mention in the U.S.A. was\r\n    observable here, but as yet I have not been able to find that\r\n    such is the case.\r\n\r\n    Many thanks to you for your presentation copy of your most\r\n    interesting paper on “Rise and Progress of Economic Entomology,”\r\n    and your only too flattering mention of my own work (pp.\r\n    295-97). On the continent of Europe there is grand work going\r\n    forward, and the colleagueship I am favoured with from many of\r\n    the leading Continental Government Entomologists is most kind\r\n    and gratifying to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 23, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I think it is but a proper respect to you, as Entomologist of\r\n    the Department of Agriculture of the U.S.A., to mention what I\r\n    have been doing relative to the recent appointment of one of the\r\n    U.S.A. staff of skilled Entomologists to the post of British\r\n    Government Entomologist in Cape Colony. On the 17th inst. I\r\n    heard from Mr. C. P. Lounsbury from Cape Town, with a letter of\r\n    introduction enclosed from Dr. Fernald, which, he regretted,\r\n    from pressure of time he had not been able to deliver. So did I,\r\n    for I should very much like to have made his personal\r\n    acquaintance, as well as that of Mrs. Lounsbury, of whom Dr.\r\n    Fernald writes in such high terms.\r\n\r\n    I think it is a most happy thing for the Cape Colony to have\r\n    secured the services of a good, trained Entomologist, but that\r\n    he should bring with him in the person of his wife a lady so\r\n    highly qualified to be a companion (an “_alter ego_”) in his\r\n    work was a good fortune past hope. I wrote at once to Mr.\r\n    Lounsbury expressing the pleasure it would be to me to\r\n    co-operate so far as lay in my power. And I have since written\r\n    to the same effect to the Agent General for the Cape of Good\r\n    Hope, especially drawing his attention to the fact (though of\r\n    course I did not word it in this way) that really instead of one\r\n    Entomologist they had thus secured the services also of an\r\n    excellently trained assistant! Yesterday morning I received a\r\n    reply, expressing his best thanks, and mentioning that he was\r\n    then communicating the contents of my letter to the Hon. the\r\n    Secretary of Agriculture at Cape Colony, who he felt sure “will\r\n    be extremely glad to hear the high opinion you entertain of the\r\n    newly appointed Entomologist, and he will also be grateful for\r\n    your friendly offer of co-operation in the work of that office.”\r\n    I hope all this will meet with your approval. I am deeply\r\n    indebted to the aid and encouragement I have received for years\r\n    from the wonderful staff of workers of the U.S.A. and from its\r\n    head—first Professor Riley, and now yourself—and if I can be of\r\n    any service to a member of it by what I can do from here it\r\n    would be a very great pleasure to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _September 1, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I never before have ventured to submit one of my leaflets to\r\n    you. I felt as if I should be taking a liberty. To-day, however,\r\n    I have a request from the Boston Public Library for one of the\r\n    leaflets on the House Sparrow, and I have therefore ventured to\r\n    ask your acceptance of a few copies sent accompanying by book\r\n    post. You will see that I have extracted largely from the\r\n    excellent work of your own Board of Agriculture, but in a\r\n    condensed work of this kind it is impossible to show the value\r\n    and importance of the observations as I should greatly desire.\r\n    At least I have acknowledged my obligation gratefully. I am sure\r\n    I need not say that I should think it a pleasure and an honour\r\n    if you cared to have some copies of the sparrow leaflet for\r\n    distribution. The farmers here are delighted to have something\r\n    reliable, and their reports confirm the severe losses which _P.\r\n    domesticus_ causes. But there is virulent opposition from a few\r\n    people who rail at me in a most unpleasant manner.\r\n\r\n    Lately I had the great pleasure of a little visit from our good\r\n    friend Dr. Fletcher, and we spent half an hour or so in cutting\r\n    up some Plum-wood, infested by what I took to be the _Xyleborus\r\n    saxeseni_ (Shot-borer beetle) (fig. 46), given as a maker of\r\n    flat cells, or burrows, by Eichhoff; but very likely you have\r\n    heard about this from him already.\r\n\r\n    I have had some nice observations in the earlier part of the\r\n    year of the workings of the Angoumois moth, _Sitotroga\r\n    (Gelechia) cerealella_, which was imported in such quantity from\r\n    North Africa in one or more cargoes of barley as to give some\r\n    alarm.\r\n\r\n    The wings, such as they are, of the female _Lipoptena cervi_\r\n    (fig. 24), have given me some good figures. There is\r\n    demonstrably at times a mere abortive wing, but whether\r\n    sometimes there has not been a developed wing which has been\r\n    torn across so that only about an eighth of the wing remains,\r\n    seems to me open to doubt. Also the Lesser earwig, _Labia\r\n    minor_, has been locally a little troublesome. Altogether there\r\n    have been a good many rather nice observations sent in, which I\r\n    hope may presently be of some interest to you. Pray accept my\r\n    sincere thanks for the enormous benefit I receive from the\r\n    valuable publications so kindly sent me, and believe me with\r\n    most hearty good wishes, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1 and 2, Moth, magnified and natural size; 3, caterpillar, magnified,\r\n    and line showing natural length; 4, pierced grain, natural size and\r\n    magnified; 5, grain with frass, magnified; 6, chrysalis in grain,\r\n    and removed, magnified, and line showing natural length.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.—ANGOUMOIS MOTH, FLY WEEVIL (U.S.A), _SITOTROGA (GELECHIA)\r\n  CEREALELLA_, OLIV.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Male; 2, female with wings expanded, much magnified; line showing\r\n    natural length of body and forceps.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 43.—LESSER EARWIG, _FORFICULA MINOR_, LINN., _LABIA MINOR_,\r\n    LEACH.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 7, 1898._\r\n\r\n    Your letter of approval was a very great pleasure to me, and I\r\n    greatly value your words of encouragement. Before this letter\r\n    reaches you, you will perhaps have received a visit from Dr.\r\n    Ritzema Bos, who gave me the pleasure of a visit on his way to\r\n    the U.S.A. to investigate the amount of danger to be feared in\r\n    Holland from this _A. perniciosus_ (San José scale). From what I\r\n    gather from the different publications with which I am most\r\n    liberally supplied from your own headquarters and the\r\n    experimental stations, I hope that we need not fear this\r\n    veritable pest making a settlement here. I have an impression\r\n    that a part of the commotion here is from a desire to exclude\r\n    foreign fruit imports. I am working now on what I hope may make\r\n    a “Handbook of Insect Attacks, injurious to Orchard and Bush\r\n    fruits, with means of Prevention and Remedy.” Fruit growing is\r\n    extending very much with us, and so many little-known attacks\r\n    have been reported to me in the last few years, that I thought a\r\n    volume including these, with our old standing attacks brought up\r\n    to date and very fully illustrated, would meet a need here. Also\r\n    I was somewhat afraid that if I did not do it myself some one or\r\n    other might be “good enough” to save me the trouble.\r\n\r\n    Our chief crop trouble during the spring and winter has been the\r\n    presence of _Tylenchus devastatrix_ (eel-worm), in clover. This\r\n    still continues, but I hope that with good growing weather and\r\n    sulphate of potash (as a manure dressing to encourage growth) we\r\n    may fight it down.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 24, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I am afraid that you will have been thinking me very negligent\r\n    in not replying sooner to your kind letter, but I felt sure you\r\n    would understand that if I could have sent any information in\r\n    reply to your inquiry about the “Cigarette beetle” I should have\r\n    hastened to submit it.\r\n\r\n    My Annual Report is late this year, for work on my Handbook,\r\n    &c., &c., threw me late.\r\n\r\n    I have been following the urgent advice of our good and much\r\n    regretted friend, Dr. Lintner, by having a “General Index”\r\n    prepared to the series of twenty-two Annual Reports (chap. IX.).\r\n    It is not a magnificently exhaustive compilation giving\r\n    everything that can be desired, like that to your invaluable\r\n    “Insect Life,” but I think that both entomologically and\r\n    practically it will be of service. When printed, I purpose to\r\n    forward copies for your own acceptance, likewise to Professor\r\n    Webster, to the State Entomologist, Albany, and a few other\r\n    positions where I think they very likely have a set of my\r\n    twenty-two annual issues, and therefore might care to have the\r\n    Index. But if I were not intruding too much on your kind good\r\n    nature, would you allow me to send a few, say a packet of ten or\r\n    twenty, to yourself, which perhaps you would so greatly oblige\r\n    me as to present to mutual friends whom you might see. I should\r\n    think this a kind favour, for I might go rather astray in my\r\n    sendings.\r\n\r\n    With my next number (all being well) I propose to commence a\r\n    “Second Series”—altering my plan a little, so as to have a\r\n    special section in which I could place any good short notes of\r\n    information sent me, thus utilising what may come to hand, but\r\n    without being encumbered by perpetual repetition, year after\r\n    year, of life history and figures, of well known, or what should\r\n    be well known, attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _June 26, 1899._\r\n\r\n    It is too good of you to give me the two copies of this valuable\r\n    pamphlet, “Some Insects Injurious to Stored Grain,” and I thank\r\n    you very much. But I did not beg for more of your publications,\r\n    and tried to get them _via_ Messrs. Wesley, because you are so\r\n    good to me, in constantly presenting information quite\r\n    invaluable to me, that, as it is, I do not know how to\r\n    reciprocate the kindness. We have nothing like your publications\r\n    to fall back on here, and when a very heavy case is brought to\r\n    me I naturally benefit by your books.\r\n\r\n    I have lately been called in about a cargo of flour of 46,200\r\n    seven-stone bags, every bag (so far as examined) infested by\r\n    _Calandra (= Sitophilus) granaria_ (Granary weevil, fig. 68),\r\n    and the Mediterranean Flour or Mill moth (fig. 41), and it was\r\n    for the importers that I was trying to procure a copy, the other\r\n    for my own lending. I am truly obliged to you.\r\n\r\n    My Index is not ready yet. I thought I could improve it, and\r\n    strained my eyes so badly that I caused delay without much good.\r\n\r\n    Now I am trying to work up _Piophila casei_ (Cheese and Bacon\r\n    fly, fig. 12) as a cheese pest. How curious it is that it should\r\n    not trouble cured meats with us, as with you—nor cheese with you\r\n    as with us.\r\n\r\n    The Shell-slug, _Testacella haliotidea_ (fig. 44), seems to me\r\n    to deserve a little notice, as (by its carnivorous habit)\r\n    ridding us of various under- and above-ground troubles (slugs\r\n    especially), and I have been gathering a few notes about the\r\n    creature for some years. Another (I believe) unusual presence\r\n    lately sent me was a specimen of the Ground Planarian, _Bipalium\r\n    kewense_, found eating plants “like a slug.” I did not know the\r\n    worm (so to call it) at all, but the name was given at S.\r\n    Kensington. When it arrived it looked only like a very narrow\r\n    slimy strip about three inches long—but I thought from its\r\n    reported habitat possibly some slightly warm water would revive\r\n    it, and immediately it roused up and swelled to a narrow\r\n    cylindrical shape, and leaving the moss on which it lay made\r\n    such fair speed (by adhesion of the lower surface) up the side\r\n    of the bowl, bearing an unpleasant looking bilobed head before\r\n    it, that I restored it to its box as soon as might be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Snail-slug, in motion; 2, contracted; 3, head, with tentacles,\r\n    magnified; 4, shell, upper and under side, slightly magnified; 5,\r\n    shell, much magnified; 6, egg (4 and 6 from Plate v. of Jeffrey’s\r\n    _British Conchology_, vol. i.; the other figures from specimens\r\n    taken at St. Albans).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 44.—SNAIL-SLUG, _TESTACELLA HALIOTIDEA_, DRAPARNAUD.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Worm extended; 2, contracted; 3, 4, and 5, different forms taken by\r\n    the head—all life size (after figures by Prof. F.

I feel very much gratified that\r\n    you should place my Index in such distinguished hands, and I\r\n    thank you very much also for your kind letter. Please allow me\r\n    to add that if you should at any time care to accept copies of\r\n    any works of mine which are in print, for yourself or friends,\r\n    it would be a real pleasure to me to be allowed to send them.\r\n\r\n    I had a very pleasant letter from Mr. Lounsbury a few days ago.\r\n    He is working with great interest on the “tick” [which conveys\r\n    the disease known as red-water or Texas fever to cattle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 21, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I do not know whether, according to etiquette, I am quite right\r\n    in mentioning the following matter, but I think that to a kind\r\n    friend like yourself I may mention the great gratification it\r\n    was to me lately to hear from the University of Edinburgh that\r\n    they were about to confer on me the Honorary LL.D. I feel this\r\n    to be a great honour. It is not only the compliment to myself\r\n    that gratifies me, but I greatly hope that one of our chief\r\n    British Universities giving its approval to Economic Entomology\r\n    will be a great strengthening to work in this country, which it\r\n    has greatly needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 30, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I was very much gratified by your kind congratulations (p. 295)\r\n    on the great honour which the University of Edinburgh has\r\n    conferred on me. They were all very kind when I went to receive\r\n    the degree. I had the great pleasure one day of meeting His\r\n    Excellency your Ambassador at the Vice-Chancellor’s [Sir William\r\n    Muir], and was charmed with the kind interest with which he\r\n    conversed on Agricultural Entomology, and indeed all subjects\r\n    which were brought forward. At the ceremony I was next to him,\r\n    and now and then he kindly interchanged a few pleasant words. As\r\n    I took my seat by him after receiving the degree he gently\r\n    whispered, “I congratulate you; you did it splendidly,” and I\r\n    thought it very interesting that my first congratulation should\r\n    be so kindly given me by the Ambassador of the greatly advanced\r\n    country to which I am so indebted for help in my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 29, 1900._\r\n\r\n    It was a great pleasure to me (though it was only such a little\r\n    visit) to make personal acquaintance with Dr. John Smith of New\r\n    Jersey. Also Dr. W. Saunders (who came for the Paris Exhibition)\r\n    and Dr. Mills kindly came to see me. These visits are very\r\n    refreshing.\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile I have been learning a great deal from your “Notes on\r\n    the Mosquitoes of the United States.” It is a great\r\n    gratification to me to possess this valuable work, and my\r\n    medical adviser, Dr. Lipscomb, is only waiting until I can spare\r\n    it, to borrow it for his own perusal. With kind regards and good\r\n    wishes and grateful thanks for all your kind help and\r\n    encouragement, pray believe me,\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                       LETTERS TO DR. J. FLETCHER\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral references to insect infestation—Progress of Economic\r\nEntomology—Success in using Paris-green in Britain—End of work done for\r\nthe Board of Agriculture and Royal Agricultural Society of England.\r\n\r\nThe series of selected letters to Dr. Fletcher in this and the\r\nsucceeding chapter is the most comprehensive of the remnants of Miss\r\nOrmerod’s correspondence with distant scientific authorities. Although\r\nonly a portion of the original group of letters, it ranges over a period\r\nof fourteen years, and touches, sometimes only lightly, a great many of\r\nthe leading objects of interest which had specially engaged her\r\nattention. Some phases of character come out here more conspicuously\r\nthan in any other part of the volume. The mutual confidence in business\r\nmatters which speedily established itself developed in this, as in most\r\nother instances, into intimate personal friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _To Dr. J. Fletcher, Dominion Entomologist, Ottawa, Canada._\r\n\r\n            DUNSTER LODGE, SPRING GROVE, ISLEWORTH, ENGLAND,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _February 4, 1886_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. FLETCHER,—You ask about gas lime (as a top dressing for\r\n    land). There is certainly need for caution in its use, but I do\r\n    not think you would find a better short treatise on it than the\r\n    little paper printed by the late Dr. [Augustus] Voelcker, of\r\n    which I have had a copy taken for you (now enclosed with much\r\n    pleasure), for I do not know where (or whether) it was\r\n    published.[70] The kind old man sent me a copy when I wrote to\r\n    him during his last illness, I not being aware how ill he was at\r\n    the time. He had a great opinion of the lime, and I think it\r\n    does immense good, but still, if too fresh or if too thickly\r\n    applied, dire are the consequences. Even if the heaps are left\r\n    standing a little while on the field, the chances are the spots\r\n    will be poisoned. But I always use it in our garden. When we\r\n    came here about twelve years ago it could be had as a gift, but\r\n    when I wanted some a few weeks ago it cost about 7s. the cart\r\n    load, and was only sold to me as a favour, there is such a run\r\n    on it. One of the market gardeners said he could not do without\r\n    it, and it is splendid for getting rid of the diseased growths\r\n    in cabbage and turnip known as “Club-root” or “Finger and Toe.”\r\n    But withal it does not do to trust the application to hands\r\n    without heads. You will find reports (or rather notes in some of\r\n    my different Reports) about quantities used.\r\n\r\n    I hope you will be able to come over, there are so many points\r\n    it would be so pleasant to talk over, and Croydon is only a\r\n    little way off by rail. It would give me great pleasure to make\r\n    your sister’s acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 19, 1886._\r\n\r\n    Lately I had good specimens of a Hippobosca, _H. Struthionis_,\r\n    Janson, which is doing harm in South Africa to Ostriches at an\r\n    up-country station. It appears to be a very curious instance of\r\n    the migration of a parasite, as M. Lichtenstein (if I remember\r\n    right, or M. Offer) thinks it may have been caught so to say by\r\n    the Ostriches from the Quagga. It is very interesting as a\r\n    quadruped pest on a bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 15, 1887._\r\n\r\n    I was so very much gratified to receive your kind letter this\r\n    morning, that I will reply as soon as I possibly can. Your\r\n    Entomological Society of Ontario is the one of all others that I\r\n    desire to belong to. I shall think it a real honour, one made\r\n    still more welcome by the kind and courteous manner in which you\r\n    notify I am likely to be permitted to have such a distinction\r\n    [honorary membership]. Your society seems to me a pattern, a\r\n    thorough example of what a Society should be, so truly\r\n    scientific, and using its knowledge for the general benefit. I\r\n    shall be proud to be allowed to add its title to my\r\n    titles—prouder still to have the approbation and cordial\r\n    friendship of its President, and its late President.\r\n\r\n    You have encouraged and gratified me very much by what you\r\n    kindly say about my Hessian fly pamphlet; very few of our\r\n    English Entomologists care for subjects of practical bearing,\r\n    and it has grown me many a grey hair,[71] to endeavour to “keep\r\n    the bridge.” The “flax-seeds” are now being found near Errol in\r\n    Scotland in the light grain or “shag,” or “chog,” as it is\r\n    called, which is thrown down by a separate apparatus from the\r\n    machine. Meantime I am trying to get a kind of cordon\r\n    established for watch on the straw at such of our importing\r\n    ports as I have influence near. We give the working men, through\r\n    whose hands the straw daily passes, full instructions what they\r\n    are to look for, where, and how, likewise a small gratuity, and\r\n    a promise of a handsome bonus to the first who finds and\r\n    produces specimens of infested imported straw. The working men\r\n    can help enormously if they are kindly and properly dealt with,\r\n    and I did not think sending an inspector would do much good.\r\n    Hessian fly puparia would not have been “at home” on the day of\r\n    his visit! Could you tell me whether straw is usually cut above\r\n    the point of attachment of the puparia in Canada? This would\r\n    make an enormous difference as to danger of infection.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Lindeman, Moscow, has given me a list of the Governments\r\n    over which _C. destructor_ has spread in Russia since its first\r\n    appearance in 1879, and with his permission I am publishing it\r\n    in my tenth Report (p. 104). Would you care to have a packet of\r\n    copies sent over? Of course I shall send copies immediately on\r\n    publication for your and Professor Saunders’s kind acceptance,\r\n    and to a few other of my Canadian friends; but if you will give\r\n    me leave I should have real gratification in having a packet\r\n    forwarded, and also begging acceptance of electros of any of my\r\n    own figures which you thought might be acceptable to your\r\n    Entomological Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS, ENGLAND,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 22, 1889_.\r\n\r\n    It was indeed a pleasure to me to see your handwriting again,\r\n    and very soon after I received your Report which you have so\r\n    kindly sent me. I have turned over the pages to see the general\r\n    contents, and first of all I am exceedingly interested in your\r\n    “Silver-top” attack corresponding with our “white eared” wheat.\r\n    They—these peculiar ears—appeared in Southern Russia, Dr.\r\n    Lindeman tells me, two years ago, and he could not discover any\r\n    insect traces any more than I could. It seems to me quite\r\n    unaccountable, if it really is caused by Thrips, that they\r\n    should not leave their cast clothing behind them! I wonder what\r\n    you will think of my idea of ring vegetable disease? Dr.\r\n    Lindeman writes me that he means to examine for _Anguillulidæ_\r\n    (eel-worms).\r\n\r\n    I am particularly interested in your notes of _C. leguminicola_\r\n    [American clover-seed midge], for I have long suspected we had\r\n    the larvæ here, and to-day I succeeded in rearing my first\r\n    imago, and have sent it off to Mr. Meade with Dr. Lintner and\r\n    Professor Saunders’s description and figures to see if he will\r\n    agree with me. Will you kindly thank Professor Saunders from me\r\n    for having the new edition of his excellent book on fruit pests\r\n    sent to me. It is a pleasure to see it in this less expensive\r\n    form, so many more people will buy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _September 2, 1889._\r\n\r\n    You must indeed have had pleasure in your visit to Washington,\r\n    but what a spectacle your study table must be on your return!\r\n    Does not the collection, all calling “answer me first,” quite\r\n    make your heart sink? I cannot face it—it is such a terrible\r\n    strain, so I stop nearly entirely at home like a limpet on a\r\n    rock, and keep my work as well as I can in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 11, 1889._\r\n\r\n    Did I tell you that the _Xyleborus dispar_, Fab. (Shot-borer),\r\n    has made what I hope may be only one of its strange intermittent\r\n    appearances, in plum stems at the great Toddington fruit ground\r\n    near Cheltenham? What a strangely destructive attack it is! I\r\n    could not completely understand how it killed the young trees so\r\n    wonderfully quickly until I dissected some stems, and found\r\n    that, like your _X. pyri_, Peck, the creatures partly ringed the\r\n    stem to begin with. And what a quantity in one stem! We need a\r\n    descriptive English name, so I propose to call it the “Crowder,”\r\n    from the manner in which all the galleries are so crowded with\r\n    the beetles, that there seems hardly room for another specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _December 6, 1889._\r\n\r\n    How very very curious is what you say about Professor Riley’s\r\n    now thinking _E. kuhniella_ (Mill moth, fig. 41) may be a South\r\n    Carolina insect. I shall await the letter you promise me with\r\n    great interest. I suppose some records have been searched out,\r\n    for in the spring he wrote me that he thought he could safely\r\n    say that this species did not occur in the United States. Dr.\r\n    Lintner also held the same view, and he is care itself. I am so\r\n    glad you told me, for I had written quite a neat little\r\n    paragraph for my Report on the remarkable circumstance of\r\n    advance of one insect attack being so minutely recorded. How\r\n    awkward it would have been! How good of you to spare me a male\r\n    specimen. It is quite different your sparing me a specimen to my\r\n    putting anything I have in your hands; I really hope you have\r\n    not robbed your own valuable collection too much. I have been\r\n    trying to compare them as well as I can manage under present\r\n    circumstances, but I cannot of course do much without the\r\n    microscope. The colour of mine is deeper, but this is not much.\r\n    It was alive, but mature, when I took it.\r\n\r\n    I do believe all good work is done in concert, though we do not\r\n    know how it may be fitting together yet. It is very often a\r\n    great comfort to me to think so.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Beetle ♀; 2, larva—magnified, with natural length of each; 3 and 4,\r\n    cell, natural size, showing broad and flat, and also narrow view.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—SHOT-BORER BEETLES, _XYLEBORUS DISPAR_, FAB.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 16, 1889._\r\n\r\n    I put off writing for a few days because I wanted to tell you\r\n    more about the _Xyleborus dispar_ (Shot-borer or Apple-bark\r\n    beetle), which I am afraid is likely to be a very serious matter\r\n    in other localities than where it first appeared, and it is\r\n    doing much mischief: I do not quite like to raise the “danger\r\n    flag” on my own sole responsibility, so I have sent out some of\r\n    the new specimens to have my identification confirmed, and then\r\n    I mean to write to you again and send a few more males. I found\r\n    seven with hardly more than that number of females; also I found\r\n    specimens of the white stuff that Schmidberger observed the\r\n    larvæ fed on, and I have asked Professor Bernard Dyer to analyse\r\n    it for me. He is a very kind as well as skilled helper. I cannot\r\n    find the least sign of disease about the attacked trees: if the\r\n    bark had been washed it could not be cleaner from Scale or\r\n    moulds of any kind, but the havoc is dismal—what my\r\n    correspondent calls “a slaughter” of trees.\r\n\r\n    We have now got the subject of Agricultural Entomology regularly\r\n    announced as one of the subjects (voluntary) for examination of\r\n    the Senior Candidates of our Royal Agricultural Society of\r\n    England. I have been trying to get this arranged for some time,\r\n    and I hope it will do good.\r\n\r\n    I have drawn up the questions as practically, _i.e._, on as\r\n    practical points as I could.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 16, 1889._\r\n\r\n    Your letter was hardly started this morning when I received the\r\n    confirmation from Mr. Oliver E. Janson of my identification of\r\n    the fresh supply of Shot-borers from plum-wood being quite\r\n    correct, beyond doubt _X. dispar._ So I have great pleasure in\r\n    enclosing two males and two females in a thin quill. They are\r\n    packed in fine bark clippings, which they have shredded out\r\n    themselves, so I hope they will travel safely. These are from\r\n    plum stems, and in some cases they attack the branches. I have\r\n    just now written a letter to the _Worcester Herald_, warning\r\n    fruit-growers to be on the alert, giving as much practical\r\n    advice as I could compress into reasonable space, and especially\r\n    recommending burning infested trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 24, 1889._\r\n\r\n    I think that Agricultural Entomology is moving forward, but we\r\n    are much hampered at present by various difficulties, which I\r\n    fancy you would dispose of very rapidly on your side of the\r\n    Atlantic. I suppose that in a sort of confidence I may mention\r\n    that by private liberality of a Scottish advancer of science a\r\n    lectureship of Agricultural Entomology is being endowed at\r\n    Edinburgh University, but then comes the rather comical\r\n    difficulty: Who ever is to take the position of lecturer? I am\r\n    complimented by the expression of a wish from the authorities\r\n    who have the election in hand that I should take it; but then\r\n    Lady Professors are not admitted in Scotland. We know of “one\r\n    man” fit for the purpose, Professor Allen Harker, of the Royal\r\n    Agricultural College, Cirencester. He would do well, and as much\r\n    desires the post as we wish to put him in it, but then the\r\n    Principal of the Royal Agricultural College is very much set\r\n    against his holding the post, as well as his Professorship at\r\n    the college. It is a great puzzle. I have been doing my very\r\n    best to help the Professor of Agriculture—a member of the\r\n    appointing body—to find a suitable man, but what will come of it\r\n    I do not know. This is not private amongst friends, but it is\r\n    not yet before the public. Why, with you, I believe in a day you\r\n    could fill the chair. I think I could do all that is wanted, but\r\n    then, oh! Shades of John Knox!\r\n\r\n    I am hoping each day to receive the copy of “Insect Life”\r\n    Professor Riley kindly sends me, and to see what the Association\r\n    of Official Entomology did at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             [_Cablegram._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 28, 1889._\r\n\r\n    Is not “Paris-green” the same as “Scheele’s-green,” that is,\r\n    arsenite of Copper, not arseniate? With us arseniate of copper\r\n    is a bluish powder; please write.[72]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _January 20, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I am exceedingly obliged to you for so kindly and promptly\r\n    replying to my enquiry about the arseniate. I thank you most\r\n    heartily, and Professor Saunders also, for so very kindly taking\r\n    the trouble to make me sure how the matter stood.\r\n\r\n    I have been taking a great deal of pains to make my paper on the\r\n    Paris-green as plain and sound as I can, but whether I can\r\n    induce the growers to use it is yet to be seen. If any of your\r\n    orchard operatives accustomed to application of it should chance\r\n    to be in England, I believe that the best way to start affairs\r\n    would be for his services to be engaged at Toddington, and from\r\n    a proper method of spraying (and, without any doubt, its good\r\n    effect), we should then, I quite believe, make progress. If you\r\n    should know of any orchard workers being likely to come over, I\r\n    should be very glad if you would give me a line, and then if\r\n    none of my orchard applicants were disposed to engage him, I\r\n    would myself ask for a lesson and a lecture, and he “should not\r\n    lack his fee,” as the old ballads say. Unless something is done\r\n    to rouse the good folks they will go on smearing and smearing\r\n    until their trees are one mass of grease, and swarming,\r\n    nevertheless, with caterpillars of all kinds.\r\n\r\n    Now, I want to mention to you and to Professor Saunders that I\r\n    have felt obliged to tell Mr. Whitehead, as gently and\r\n    courteously as I could, that I must decline to continue the\r\n    assistance which I have given since 1885 to the Entomological\r\n    part of his work as Agriculture Adviser to the Board of\r\n    Agriculture. I have recommended professional helpers who can aid\r\n    him in the technical identifications, and if he needs more aid\r\n    on general matters I have suggested that he should apply to\r\n    Professor Harker, who has a great deal of strictly technical\r\n    entomological knowledge, and of late years has given much\r\n    attention to the agricultural application of it.\r\n\r\n    Even if the post of “Entomologist” should be offered to me, I\r\n    should not think myself justified in accepting, for my great\r\n    wish in my work is to be of immediate use, and if I had to wait\r\n    for permission from boards and committees, &c., &c., before I\r\n    came down on pests that want attention by return of post, I\r\n    should not feel in the right place. Please forgive my telling\r\n    you this story about myself, but though of course it is only\r\n    meant for private friends, I thought I ought to let you know. My\r\n    own work has steadily increased to such an extent that, with\r\n    this sort of underground (unacknowledged) Government work in\r\n    addition, I did not feel able to do full justice to it, and\r\n    especially I wanted more time for experiment and correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 13, 1890._\r\n\r\n     Many thanks for your kind congratulations on my better health.\r\n    I am really better now. Work was bearing me down so very\r\n    seriously I was obliged to make some degree of alteration. I\r\n    regretted very much indeed not continuing any help I could give\r\n    to Mr. Whitehead about his entomological Government work, but it\r\n    was too severe a task, and it prevented my giving proper\r\n    attention to my own, and likewise when the post of Agricultural\r\n    Adviser was avowedly a paid one, I felt, and my friends felt,\r\n    that if aid were needed it ought to be on a business footing and\r\n    obtained from professional helpers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 24, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I thank you very heartily for the little box of _X. dispar_\r\n    which you have kindly spared, for your own paper on the\r\n    “Mediterranean Flour Moth” preceding the copy in the “Canadian\r\n    Entomologist,” and for all the information in your always truly\r\n    acceptable letters. The little beetles came quite safely. I\r\n    divided them duly, and I have no doubt both Mr. Janson and Canon\r\n    Fowler will be very much pleased to possess them.\r\n\r\n    Our Worcestershire and Toddington people are really roused to\r\n    see about these weary caterpillars. We have formed a “committee\r\n    of experiment” with two or three very sensible and able men at\r\n    the head, and I officiate as their entomologist, and benefit the\r\n    stationer, at least! You should see the sheets of paper covered\r\n    with sage advice!\r\n\r\n    At present I am trying to keep well before them that the very\r\n    centre of all advance is to arrange our “washes” and our means\r\n    of applying them, so that we may be able to destroy the hordes\r\n    about May or June, when they are really and evidently doing\r\n    harm. Your information is invaluable, not only in itself but\r\n    because whatever may be advanced I can say Mr. Fletcher advised\r\n    it, or more often, reported its success in Canada, and I feel\r\n    secure. I really hope we shall make progress; the leading people\r\n    are quite weary of this everlasting greasing, but I certainly do\r\n    feel that our only excuse for asking you so many questions about\r\n    it, is your own great knowledge of the subject, and great good\r\n    nature; and, indeed, I am most truly grateful.\r\n\r\n    Professor William Fream, of Downton College of Agriculture, has\r\n    just been appointed, by unanimous vote of Council of our Royal\r\n    Agricultural Society, to be Associate Editor of their journal.\r\n    This is such an excellent appointment it delights me. Professor\r\n    Fream is an old friend of mine, so that besides the great\r\n    benefit to the society of having such an able man in the post, I\r\n    gain a skilled and heartily helpful colleague.\r\n\r\n    I hope that you will come over to England this summer, it would\r\n    be such a benefit to me and such a pleasure both to my sister\r\n    and myself. We hope you will stay here as long as you can make\r\n    it convenient. This is a very good centre, and Rothamsted [the\r\n    great English Agricultural Experiment Station] is only about\r\n    four and a half miles off, and I am quite sure the staff would\r\n    be delighted to show you everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _July 7, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I believe that after our hard fight we have won the victory and\r\n    Paris-green is now acknowledged, so far as the area of the work\r\n    of our Committee has spread, as an indispensable insecticide in\r\n    orchard-growing on a large scale. The caterpillars have been\r\n    killed and the leafage not injured, and the Superintendents at\r\n    Toddington are, up to date, quite satisfied and grateful. We are\r\n    greatly indebted to you for your kind and able help, and what it\r\n    has been to me I cannot say. It would fill a volume to record\r\n    the progress of our work. It at first appeared as if the spirit\r\n    of folly had got into the heads of the opposition; everything\r\n    imaginable turned up one after another, and, as Entomologist to\r\n    the Committee, I have hardly had a day’s peace till now for\r\n    weeks or months. We had one definite combination against us, and\r\n    when all seemed quiet the beekeepers raised a commotion. This\r\n    had to be answered publicly, but it seemed self-evident that if\r\n    we did not spray when the trees were in flower we would not hurt\r\n    the bees. One of our members made a commotion about his own\r\n    health, and I had to point out to him that if he were not used\r\n    to standing out in a March wind slopping with cold water (only I\r\n    put it more politely) he was likely to feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n    If we meet, as I hope we may some day, I am sure you would be\r\n    entertained with “The rise and progress of Paris-green.” But\r\n    really all the work and terrible anxiety have tried me very\r\n    much, and I am going to have a little holiday with my sister for\r\n    a couple of days at Oxford as a refreshment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _October 6, 1890._\r\n\r\n    You encourage me very much indeed by all you so kindly say, and\r\n    I value your approval of my new book greatly, but I always feel,\r\n    and I try to acknowledge, that the real usefulness of my work is\r\n    derived from the kind co-operation I am allowed the benefit of.\r\n    Just look at the Paris-green matter. I quite sheltered myself\r\n    behind your name as an active referee. The good folks were hard\r\n    of belief anyhow, but I really doubt if I could have driven the\r\n    nail home without having you to fall back on. But for the pain\r\n    that it could not fail to give, the history of our Evesham\r\n    Committee’s work, and what we had to meet, would be a most\r\n    interesting chapter, and at last we had perfect success!\r\n\r\n    I think I told you of the wonderfully diseased strawberry\r\n    plants, looking more like pieces of cauliflowers placed on the\r\n    ground than their own graceful forms. Dr. Ritzema Bos has found\r\n    that this is from the presence of a _Tylenchus_ (eel-worm)\r\n    (figs. 47 and 49), hitherto undescribed, and is going to bring\r\n    out a preliminary notice in November, and as some portion of the\r\n    observations (not the scientific parts) were mine, he will\r\n    kindly let me use what I need for my Report. He is a very kind\r\n    colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 18, 1890._\r\n\r\n    My sister is delighted to send you two copies of her Hessian fly\r\n    maggot diagram, which she hopes you will kindly accept. This, as\r\n    she says, is “her first public appearance,” so she is rather\r\n    anxious! But I have been doing my best to ensure her picture a\r\n    good reception, and I revised it very carefully before it went\r\n    out. I think you will like it. It should accompany this letter,\r\n    but it comes so very near parcel post limitations of size that\r\n    if it does not arrive please expect it shortly in a different\r\n    travelling dress, by book post.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 22, 1890._\r\n\r\n    For your collection you will, I think, like a regular letter of\r\n    our good old Professor Westwood, but this is not in the least\r\n    characteristic. He usually takes a postcard, and into it, by\r\n    small writing, and adding in little bits where there is room, he\r\n    gets in a surprising quantity of instructive matter. Mr. Meade’s\r\n    letter you would perhaps care for, as he is one of our leading\r\n    Dipterists—he is very kind to me in identifying whenever I ask\r\n    him; and the letter from Mr. Hormuzd Rassam is a contribution\r\n    from my sister. He was, I suppose, our greatest British explorer\r\n    in Assyria (after Sir Henry Layard) and was for a long time one\r\n    of the prisoners of King Theodore in Abyssinia (to liberate whom\r\n    this country went to war). I am not sure whether you saw him\r\n    when you were at Spring Grove, but he was a near neighbour, and\r\n    when he went on his Assyrian trips used to leave his very\r\n    charming wife, and untoward little flock of Chaldee children, in\r\n    what he was pleased to call “our care.”\r\n\r\n    Many thanks to you for such gratifying notices of my Manual.\r\n    They are only too kind, but it is very encouraging to have such\r\n    approval, and very refreshing too, for sometimes I am nearly\r\n    eaten up by anxiety.\r\n\r\n    I think the beneficial effect of Paris-green is quite\r\n    established, and I hope that the use of it may spread widely\r\n    next season; I fully believe that in it or in London-purple,\r\n    lies the sole hope of keeping in check the crowds of\r\n    miscellaneous kinds of moth caterpillars which appear with the\r\n    leafage. In my fourteenth Report (that is, in the paper on\r\n    orchard caterpillars which I am now preparing for it) I have\r\n    tried to dwell with even tedious repetition on the points of the\r\n    small quantity of the Paris-green to be used, and also the\r\n    importance of the fluid being distributed as a mist or fine\r\n    spray so as to coat the leaves, but on no account to be allowed\r\n    to drip. Some of the good people seem to have an idea that they\r\n    cannot have too much of a good thing, and results are dismal.\r\n\r\n    I am getting on as steadily as business allows with my new\r\n    Manual. There are many new papers, and such subjects as\r\n    Wireworm, Hop aphis, and others come out almost as new papers\r\n    when the information which has been contributed piece-meal or in\r\n    Special Reports, is sifted, and the information arranged in\r\n    order. I am replacing figures that were not all that could be\r\n    wished, with new ones. I am very anxious indeed to bring out\r\n    what may be a really sound, up-to-date book, of our most\r\n    important observations here. I think it will be about a quarter\r\n    longer than my present edition, and “demy” instead of “crown”\r\n    8vo., so that it may be of comely form.\r\n\r\n    Economic Entomology is really doing better here. Our Highland\r\n    and Agricultural Society of Scotland are looking about for an\r\n    Entomologist, and this is a good step. [Dr. Stewart MacDougall\r\n    was appointed to fill the office.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 23, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I have at once replied to your inquiry as shortly as I could\r\n    manage, for I know how valuable space is, but indeed I shall be\r\n    quite hurt and annoyed!—and your report will not give a right\r\n    view!—unless you say that we applied to you, and that our work\r\n    was in colleagueship. I really do not know whether I could have\r\n    worked as was requisite, unless I could have had the advantage\r\n    of being able to quote from your letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _February 2, 1891._\r\n\r\n    Would you think me very greedy if I were to ask you for another\r\n    copy of the “Proceedings of the Convention of Fruitgrowers,”\r\n    1890. It would be a most acceptable help to the Evesham Fruit\r\n    Experiment Committee. I should very much like them to read what\r\n    you say about Paris-green, &c., but I am afraid if they had my\r\n    copy it might not come home again. I have formed a short paper\r\n    on “Paris-Green, its Uses and Method of Application for\r\n    Prevention of Orchard Moth Caterpillars.” I think it is all\r\n    right, I have been very careful and plain, and I thought we must\r\n    have some directions out before the season’s work begins. We are\r\n    finding wingless Winter moths and some other kinds going up the\r\n    trees now, and this shows that there is no good trusting only to\r\n    grease-banding, for we should have really to grease from October\r\n    to April to catch all the offenders! Our intermittent frosts let\r\n    the creatures appear at intervals in a way which I suppose you\r\n    are quite free from in Canada. Surely it should be recorded of\r\n    me,\r\n\r\n               “SHE INTRODUCED PARIS-GREEN INTO ENGLAND”!\r\n\r\n    You should see the mass of correspondence since this time last\r\n    year, from the first feeble efforts, through opposition and all\r\n    sorts of things, up to success. The work is well begun, and\r\n    though I may in fun mention myself, our Experimental Committee\r\n    has worked wisely and grandly. Now they are going to publish the\r\n    reports of all the members who have sent them in. That by Mr.\r\n    Wise[73] is very good indeed, and I am to write a preface for\r\n    them, so I can show the teachings, where they agree, and why\r\n    they differ.\r\n\r\n    We have had a long spell of cold weather, bringing great\r\n    suffering to the poor, and to my sister and myself the loss of a\r\n    brother, who was “coldstruck” and carried off almost\r\n    instantaneously by _angina pectoris_. I had a temporary share in\r\n    troubles from a severe fall, my feet going from under me down a\r\n    slope on hidden ice, and sending me down on the back of my head;\r\n    but I think I am right again now.\r\n\r\n    There is a great want over here of some kind of lesson book for\r\n    village schools telling something that would interest the\r\n    boys—possibly, too, the girls. I do not know whether I could\r\n    manage it, but I am thinking of trying to take some thirty or so\r\n    of the very commonest attacks—including a very few to stock,\r\n    which boys always care about—and seeing what I can do. I have a\r\n    hope that through the boys we might get at the agricultural\r\n    labourers and cowmen.\r\n\r\n    I like your address very much at the Economic Entomologists’\r\n    meeting in reply to Professor Riley’s grand and comprehensive\r\n    address; but as yet I have not been able quite to make out the\r\n    scope of the Society’s arrangements for extra-American members.\r\n    It must be a great pleasure to all members who can meet, to talk\r\n    over serviceable points, and a great benefit conferred on the\r\n    country, but I am puzzled about the external bearings. It does\r\n    not seem to affect me say, for example, in my communication with\r\n    such kind friends as yourself and Dr. Lintner. I would venture\r\n    any way, I think, to ask at your convenience for advice or\r\n    instruction, and where I can afford information I shall think\r\n    myself honoured and happy to render it.\r\n\r\n    But I do not understand qualification. You have the names of Mr.\r\n    C. and Mr. S. on your list. I do not know the gentlemen, so\r\n    cannot tell what they may be doing, but our grand old chief, my\r\n    entomological master, and friend almost of a lifetime, dear old\r\n    Professor Westwood, is not there, and yet _ex-officio_ as Hope\r\n    Professor of Zoology he lectures on Entomology (to the best of\r\n    my belief) regularly at Oxford. And what work Dr. Lindeman does!\r\n    It would be a great help over here if we had some such Society.\r\n    My work is so very solitary, but I do what I can.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Fream’s lectures [Steven course in Edinburgh University]\r\n    have been quite a success. This delights me. Professor Wallace\r\n    has been exceedingly pleased with the sound manner in which he\r\n    built up his Agricultural Entomology in the students’ minds, and\r\n    I think the course has given great satisfaction. He is a very\r\n    sound worker, and I should greatly like him to be my\r\n    collaborateur at the Royal Agricultural Society of England. I\r\n    have not brought the subject forward yet, but if there were an\r\n    Assistant Entomologist who might present my Reports instead of\r\n    my personal attendance being necessary in all the business hurry\r\n    of that great number of gentlemen, it would relieve me of a very\r\n    distasteful part of my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 23, 1891._\r\n\r\n    We have just got a full stream of applications for gratuitous\r\n    distribution of “Paris-green” pamphlets, so we are very anxious\r\n    to keep all in hand. I greatly hope that this will take hold. We\r\n    broke through many objections last year, and now we can point to\r\n    saved crops, and no disastrous massacre of gardeners—not even a\r\n    sparrow defunct; also a lessened amount of Winter moth in\r\n    autumn, and a glorious promise of flower bud on trees which have\r\n    been reported on. Last year we did not know where to turn for a\r\n    proper sprayer; now, on the day before yesterday there was to be\r\n    a “contest of sprayers” at the Crystal Palace. I think this\r\n    shows of itself how the matter on insecticide sprayings has come\r\n    forward. I am fairly broadcasting the P.G. pamphlets. Many years\r\n    ago when a railway bridge on a new method of construction was\r\n    made over the Wye (plate XXVI), near my old home, the natives\r\n    were “afraid for their lives” to go over it, but the ingenious\r\n    plan was struck, of running any one gratuitously over and back\r\n    all day long—the trains of trucks were crammed, the people\r\n    shouted for joy, and the victory was won; and now I am carrying\r\n    out the same principle. Gentle and simple, wise and very unwise,\r\n    are wanting “Paris-green” pamphlets, and I hope that by the\r\n    sheets of advice, &c., that have to be sent accompanying, that\r\n    the very silliest souls will not do harm; and meanwhile we are\r\n    getting the subject popularised. You will think that I am _tête\r\n    montée_ about it, but it has been a long, severe labour, and I\r\n    thoroughly believe that on the adoption of the arsenical\r\n    insecticides depends the success of the English orchard growing\r\n    in the future.\r\n\r\n    So far as I see, the “grubs” have not been the least the worse\r\n    for the cold of the recent frost so long as they were in their\r\n    self-made shelters below ground, but we carried devastation\r\n    amongst hundreds of Cockchafer grubs, _Melolontha vulgaris_, by\r\n    ploughing. The larvæ were too torpid to bury themselves, and the\r\n    birds disposed of them very thoroughly.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Lindeman writes that he “had a district inspection set on\r\n    foot” to find presence of _Tylenchus devastatrix_ in Russia, but\r\n    “always with negative results.” This is very interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVI.\r\n  RAILWAY BRIDGE ON THE WYE, NEAR CHEPSTOW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Adults; 2, anterior of female, showing mouthspear; 3, embryo in\r\n    egg—all greatly magnified, anterior portion 440 times (from figures\r\n    by Dr. J.

These are of our most destructive or most\r\n    remarkable insect pests—and our Royal Agricultural Society has\r\n    approved so highly of those which are printed that they have\r\n    arranged for her to transfer to them the ownership of copyright\r\n    of the set. This gratifies her very much. They pay her “out of\r\n    pocket” expenses of printing and she presents the copyrights and\r\n    her work. I think they form a very beautiful collection, and I\r\n    believe the Society means to bring them out (together with my\r\n    previous ones—p. 99) in little half-dozen sets. Thus, one set\r\n    for village schools, one for fruit-growers, one for forest use.\r\n    I hope they will be very useful in this way for those who do not\r\n    wish to purchase the whole.\r\n\r\n    We have certainly good proof this year that in our insular\r\n    climate cold does not “kill the grubs.” If it were possible it\r\n    would even seem the Entomons were the better for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 26, 1891._\r\n\r\n    A letter came from Adelaide to announce Mr. Frazer Crawford’s\r\n    decease. It was caused by chronic gout and heart disease. He had\r\n    been as cheerful as usual, and when a friend left him about nine\r\n    o’clock in the evening he set to work to prepare a scientific\r\n    article, but not long after he went to bed. On the following\r\n    morning, October 30th, the servant found the lamp still burning,\r\n    but Mr. Crawford had quietly passed away as if in sleep with his\r\n    book, a volume of Cryptogamic Botany, fallen from his hand. He\r\n    was a perfectly indefatigable worker; even in the last month of\r\n    his life, weighed down as he was by all the inconveniences and\r\n    pains of hip disease besides those which took him from us, he\r\n    prepared a long paper on vegetable and other plant pests for the\r\n    “Garden and Field,” in which he wrote, besides a review of my\r\n    Manual. And a warning paper by him on the danger of importing\r\n    _Phylloxera_ appeared in the Report of the Bureau of Agriculture\r\n    of South Australia accompanying the notice of his death. As a\r\n    friend he was excessively valued by all who knew his kindness\r\n    and his worth, and his loss is deeply regretted at Adelaide. To\r\n    myself it is a very great cause of regret both as a true friend\r\n    and an Entomological colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _February 6-8, 1892._\r\n\r\n    I have this afternoon sent the index to my fifteenth Report up\r\n    to press, and am now enjoying myself by at least beginning a\r\n    letter to you. I hope you will like the report. The paper on\r\n    _Plutella cruciferarum_ (Diamond-back moth) is quite enormously\r\n    long, but I believe so far as evidence in my hands shows, that,\r\n    taking all points of the attack together, it has been unexampled\r\n    in this country before, and I was very desirous to present a\r\n    trustworthy record, which would bear sifting at every corner as\r\n    to what did happen, and readers could judge for themselves\r\n    whether my conclusions are well founded. I think the moths were\r\n    wind-borne. When the report reaches you I should very much like\r\n    if you would read the “General Summary,” pp. 157-164, first, or\r\n    you may really wonder what could have induced me to give such a\r\n    host of reports on the pest. I greatly doubt whether, without\r\n    proper identification, we could trust to farmers distinguishing\r\n    between Diamond-back moth caterpillars and those of Turnip\r\n    sawfly, and there is no good at all in trusting to their\r\n    reminiscences! No more than to moths being attracted to the dark\r\n    side of a lighthouse (see p. 159 of my Report). I have taken\r\n    great pains to be accurate.\r\n\r\n    In No. 1 of “Canadian Entomologist” for this year, which arrived\r\n    on Saturday, the 6th, I read with much interest some of the\r\n    observations on “Can insects survive freezing?” and I thought\r\n    perhaps you might like to look at a few slight observations\r\n    which I read before our Entomological Society in 1879. At that\r\n    time I was one of the regular daily observers of the Royal\r\n    Meteorological Society, so I was able to be sure of readings of\r\n    temperatures, but I could not get nearly as many examples as I\r\n    wanted of the insects. Mr. Whipple’s experiment, which I have\r\n    added, was the best. I used to think it very interesting to see\r\n    how some larvæ would crack across like little bits of stick, and\r\n    their brethren when thawed would recover themselves. If you\r\n    think the remarks are of any interest pray make any use that you\r\n    please of them—it would delight me if they were of any use.\r\n\r\n    Have you chanced to hear from any quarter that the Mediterranean\r\n    flour moth (p. 179) has made its appearance in Moscow? It is now\r\n    a few weeks since Dr. Lindeman wrote me that it had been found\r\n    there in a chocolate or cocoa store brought by bags from London\r\n    (England). Apparently the enemy was descended on with full\r\n    power, and no delay, and he hoped it was stamped out. It puzzled\r\n    me at first how _kuhniella_ came to be in chocolate, &c., but it\r\n    was suggested that these food-cake compositions were much\r\n    adulterated with flour. The pest is steadily spreading here, and\r\n    you will see in my Report that I have again reprinted a portion\r\n    of your directions.\r\n\r\n    The weather has been so wet that very great breadths of\r\n    wheat-land have remained unsown, so at present I have had little\r\n    inquiry about the young plant pests, but with warmth and\r\n    sunshine I expect they will come with a rush. I am just\r\n    beginning a second edition of my little “Guide.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Caterpillar; 2, eggs; 3-5, diamond-back moth, natural size and\r\n    magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.—DIAMOND-BACK MOTH, _PLUTELLA CRUCIFERARUM_, ZELL., _CEROSTOMA\r\n    XYLOSTELLA_, CURTIS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 22, 1892._\r\n\r\n    After an operation on my knee the joint was right, but the long\r\n    suffering had lowered my health exceedingly—and great pain\r\n    pretty constantly in the troubled limb, with occasionally\r\n    racking neuralgia, reduced me to such a state that I was gravely\r\n    warned recovery was hopeless unless I lessened the enormous load\r\n    of work. So as it was the engaged and routine work of my\r\n    “office” which was so very harassing, I resigned my post at the\r\n    Royal Agricultural Society as their Consulting Entomologist, and\r\n    I have ever since been steadily progressing towards recovery.\r\n    Sleep has returned, and the terrible pain of the neuralgia is\r\n    gone, and I can work happily and comfortably.\r\n\r\n    I do not know how it happened, but the work (quite beyond what\r\n    seemed my work) amplified on all hands—Continental and Colonial,\r\n    and revision of papers, &c., &c.—until it would have required a\r\n    good man of business and a staff to see to it all. So I cut the\r\n    Gordian knot.\r\n\r\n    I hope not to make any difference at all in my Agricultural\r\n    Entomological work for the country, especially as referee for\r\n    the farmers and fruit-growers and the agricultural papers; also\r\n    to continue my Annual Reports—and in all ways to work\r\n    thoroughly. But this is very different to being obliged to\r\n    attend _ex-officio_ to people and things who or which appeared\r\n    to me really often to take up time to little purpose, or even to\r\n    prevent attention to really important investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 21, 1892._\r\n\r\n    One very great trouble last year was the fungoid attack to\r\n    cabbage and turnip roots, which we call here “Club” or “Anbury,”\r\n    or “Finger and Toe.” I do not know whether you have it in\r\n    Canada. You will recognise it perhaps best under the scientific\r\n    name of the “Slime fungus” which causes it—_Plasmodiophora\r\n    brassicæ_ of Woronin. Our people confuse it so constantly with\r\n    maggot root attacks that they send me a deal of inquiry about\r\n    it, so I do not think there can be any harm (as I have really\r\n    studied it for many years) in giving a paper on it in my next\r\n    Report, and I have secured three excellent photos from life,\r\n    which I hope will each give a good whole-page figure of the\r\n    three chief forms respectively.\r\n\r\n    There are some nice new reports of infestation (so to describe\r\n    them), and I am working as steadily as I can, but I wish I could\r\n    get on faster. I envy you your power of doing sound and good\r\n    work so rapidly.\r\n\r\n    I have never thanked you for your excellent paper on the “Horn\r\n    fly” (_Hæmatobia connicola_), which I read with very great\r\n    interest and benefit, and lodged some of your liberal supply of\r\n    copies where I thought they would be most useful—including\r\n    getting attention drawn to the subject in the “Agricultural\r\n    Gazette.”\r\n\r\n    Dr. Bethune most kindly asked my sister and myself to come over\r\n    to stay at Port Hope for the Chicago Exhibition, but delightful\r\n    as it would be to see all the friends who would be gathered to\r\n    such a centre, neither sister nor self could manage the fatigue.\r\n\r\n    Our millionaire lady who is so known for her philanthropic\r\n    work—Baroness Burdett-Coutts—wrote me that she had been elected\r\n    President of the, or a Woman’s Branch of the, Chicago\r\n    Exhibition, and desired an account of the “Genesis of my\r\n    organisation!” What could I say? There is not a woman but myself\r\n    and my sister in it. I thought of Canning’s famous “Knife\r\n    Grinder” story, “God bless you, I have none to tell, sir.” The\r\n    Baroness wrote that she was obtaining information from the\r\n    Bishops and the heads of all the Churches, so I suppose her\r\n    branch is _pur et simple_ religious female organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Larva; 2 and 3, females; 4 and 5, eggs in different stages of\r\n    development—all enormously magnified (2 from sketch by E.

I should have liked to give the name of the sufferer,\r\n    but he is our greatest English tomato grower, and it might have\r\n    injured his business. He is trying many experiments, and at the\r\n    end of April he is going to give me a report. It would be a\r\n    pleasure indeed if we managed to make out any serviceable\r\n    remedy.\r\n\r\n    At present I am trying to make a fair history and description of\r\n    the Gooseberry scale, _Lecanium ribis_, Fitch, which has made\r\n    such a headquarters here (I suppose set up when I was too ill to\r\n    look after it) that I think I must almost have a chance of\r\n    finding the desiderated male! But except the few lines by Dr.\r\n    Signoret we do not seem to have a European description. Locusts\r\n    came over in imported vegetables and fodder about a month ago,\r\n    so that I secured three species, but no more are arriving now.\r\n    Mine and the grower’s chief investigation at present is as to\r\n    finding measures to check the attack of the Mustard beetle,\r\n    _Phædon betulæ_, and evil-doers of similar habits, and I am\r\n    making a kind of link in operations with Messrs. Colman and\r\n    Messrs. Keen, our two great rival mustard firms, and I greatly\r\n    hope we shall make some advance.\r\n\r\n    One great worry is these (to my thinking) unqualified so-called\r\n    lecturers sent out by the County Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Beetle, natural size and magnified; maggot, magnified, and natural\r\n    size on leaf.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.—MUSTARD BEETLE, _PHÆDON BETULÆ_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 22, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I only knew as a fact a very little while ago that Professor\r\n    Riley was standing for the post of “Hope Professor of Zoology”\r\n    at Oxford, vacant by the death of our grand old friend Professor\r\n    Westwood. Mr. Hachett-Jackson (Professor Westwood’s assistant, I\r\n    believe) wrote to me very urgently from Keble College, and I\r\n    responded most heartily, mentioning everything I could think of\r\n    that might assist Professor Riley’s election. It would have been\r\n    a benefit to myself past hoping for to have a really great\r\n    Entomologist like Professor Riley in a definite post over here.\r\n    The magician’s rod would have beaten all kinds of underhand\r\n    misrepresentations, scientific and practical, out of the field.\r\n    Anyway I fear that Professor Riley has hardly a chance, and\r\n    indeed I wonder that he should contemplate changing his grand\r\n    central position—central to the whole world—for such a very\r\n    inferior post without genial colleagues around him.\r\n\r\n    By book post accompanying I send a copy of Mons. J. Danysz’s\r\n    paper on _Ephestia_ (Flour moth), to your kind acceptance, in\r\n    case you have not yet seen it; you will be interested to run it\r\n    over and see his views of _Pyrethrum_. I very much doubt whether\r\n    we could get our millers to try it, but it would be different\r\n    with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n      LETTERS TO DR.

Dr. C. J. S. Bethune,\r\nanother Canadian Entomologist, who held a high place in Miss Ormerod’s\r\nesteem, both as a man of science and as a sympathetic friend in whom to\r\nconfide in times of sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _To Dr. J. Fletcher, Dominion Entomologist, Ottawa, Canada._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                            _September 29-30, 1893_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR DR. FLETCHER,—We were very glad to hear you had safely\r\n    returned home. I wish we could have had a longer chat, but I\r\n    will be thankful for the very great pleasure of chatting with\r\n    you at all.\r\n\r\n    Just after you had left (or rather, I think, were leaving)\r\n    England the Rothamsted Jubilee took place, which brought very\r\n    many distinguished agriculturists to this part of the country,\r\n    and you may imagine how much it was wished that you could have\r\n    been present. I did not attend, but a few friends from long\r\n    distances off looked in here on their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 _November 26 and December 1, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I have long been owing you a letter, and thanks, too, for your\r\n    “Entomological Report,” which I read at once when it reached me.\r\n    You know the pleasure and the confidence I feel in all I learn\r\n    from your writings. They and your kind co-operation have been an\r\n    immense help to my work and me for many a year, which I have\r\n    never ceased to appreciate most gratefully. I am working now on\r\n    my next Annual Report. There has been a good deal of nice fresh\r\n    matter sent in, and (so far as I could) I have tried not to go\r\n    over old ground. I have a grand paper on Locusts (fig. 55), my\r\n    specimens being identified at Madrid by Senor Don Igo Bolivar.\r\n    Wasps were a terrible plague—and I have got some charming\r\n    observations, so entertaining! but I have taken great care to\r\n    have them on good authority—and M. Schoyen kindly sent me some\r\n    notes by the Swedish State Entomologist of an enormous\r\n    appearance at Tromsoe a few years ago. As this is so high up in\r\n    the Arctic circle I thought the record would be of interest\r\n    scientifically, and it is so spirited I have had many a good\r\n    laugh over it (p. 239).\r\n\r\n    But what I hope you may be really pleased with is, that through\r\n    the kind introduction of Dr. Friedrich Thomas, of Ohrdruf, whom\r\n    you will know, I think, as one of our leading European\r\n    Phytopathologists, I was put in communication with Dr. A. Nalepa\r\n    (of Vienna), who for some years back has quite especially\r\n    devoted himself to the study of _Phytoptidæ_ (Blister galls). So\r\n    that now we have in his successive publications first-rate\r\n    specific descriptions, with measurements and everything\r\n    requisite for certain identification of all the species which he\r\n    has studied so far. Also in very many cases he gives good\r\n    magnified figures, and he added to his many kindnesses to myself\r\n    by sending me a plate with the details of the creatures marked\r\n    with the technical names. In his treatises already published he\r\n    has given excellent accounts of very many species as well as a\r\n    good serviceable classification, and I rather think that the\r\n    work which has been coming out in the Reports of the Imperial\r\n    Scientific Society of Vienna is to be completed this spring.\r\n\r\n    This letter has been lying by me for a few days for an addition\r\n    I wanted to make, and now I have to thank you very heartily for\r\n    the great kindness which you have shown to poor Mr. T—— [a West\r\n    of England farmer who had been unfortunate]. If he can manage to\r\n    adapt himself to circumstances your timely and great assistance\r\n    will have been the means of setting him up again. I doubted\r\n    rather whether it was right of me to trouble you about him,\r\n    still I thought I would venture, and indeed your help will have\r\n    been the means of saving him from going quite down. I had no\r\n    idea (no more apparently than Mr. T——) that his Canadian\r\n    prospects on his own and relations’ standing were so hopeless.\r\n    Do you think a little money would help? Say a couple of £5 notes\r\n    or so, for possibly thick clothing is a matter needing supply.\r\n    If you think it would be well, we would very gladly (if you\r\n    would kindly give me his address) send out a little. One can get\r\n    over scruples by calling it “a loan,” and to be returned, if\r\n    ever, at convenience, or not at all if more so, but I do not\r\n    like to send without your leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _December 5, 1893._\r\n\r\n    A hasty line to catch post, about Dr. Nalepa’s books. I have\r\n    just heard from Messrs. Wesley that they have ordered (as I\r\n    asked them) a duplicate set of the four of Dr. N.’s pamphlets\r\n    which I have, and sent you the names of yesterday. When these\r\n    arrive I shall send them on to you, hoping you will kindly\r\n    accept them, if for no other reason, to be a trifling reminder\r\n    to you of how much I appreciate your always kind help to myself.\r\n    The money value, as I mentioned to you, is small, but I am very\r\n    desirous that you should have them as soon as possible, and\r\n    ordering from here will save some delay.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Sinclair [the editor] wrote me thanks for your paper, and\r\n    that he is having a figure of your fly copied for the “Live\r\n    Stock Journal.” This will attract attention surely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 21, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I wonder if you ever came across any observation of\r\n    moths—_i.e._, their larvæ—injuring silk in the raw material, as\r\n    they habitually do woollen goods. I did not know that they did,\r\n    but this morning I had an inquiry about it from Tiverton, and\r\n    amongst the moths sent as offenders was a lovely white cocoon,\r\n    which appeared as if it might have been made of the same\r\n    material as the beautifully fine silk manufactured web or net\r\n    sent with it, and outside this cocoon, now empty, were a number\r\n    of little pellets of pale larval excrement, as if they were the\r\n    results of feeding on very pale material. I hope to hear more of\r\n    this. Would it not be a nice new observation?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 13, 1894._\r\n\r\n    Very many thanks for the copy of your charming Report kindly\r\n    sent to myself, and the six so liberally also presented, which I\r\n    am placing carefully where they will be appreciated and useful.\r\n    One I sent to our Lancashire and Cheshire Entomological Society,\r\n    to the pleasure of the President. They are doing a good deal of\r\n    nice work, and were going to have a special exhibition of\r\n    _Silphidæ_ (Beet carrion beetles), with observations (fig. 26).\r\n    I like your Report very much; there is an immense amount of\r\n    good, sound, straightforward information, both scientific and\r\n    practical, in it, and it is quite an example of honest dealing\r\n    with your body of observers. I have been very much interested in\r\n    your Silpha notes, and I wonder whether we could get our farmers\r\n    to try poisoning the cutworms, “surface caterpillars” as we call\r\n    them here. I wonder whether I should not do well to follow your\r\n    example and have short notes of anything interesting, even\r\n    without giving a long story. These embody a great deal of useful\r\n    information, but with us who are so behindhand in entomological\r\n    information, I have been afraid that without a full account and\r\n    a figure the readers would be all abroad. I was very much\r\n    gratified to see the honourable place you give my name among\r\n    your colleagues. Indeed this pleases me very much.\r\n\r\n    I was very much interested with what you told me of overplus of\r\n    wasps having accompanied deficiency of rainfall in one portion\r\n    of your part of the world. Our Press has been very kind to me,\r\n    and I was particularly pleased with one remark, that (although\r\n    retired from the Royal Agricultural Society) I had not ceased to\r\n    be the “Consulting Entomologist of the Agriculturists of Great\r\n    Britain.”\r\n\r\n    Just now I am running a leaflet on _Bryobia prætiosa_\r\n    (Gooseberry red spider), through the press, and this morning I\r\n    had an order for 3,000 copies! Just think of that, and without\r\n    the firm even seeing it!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 9, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I am trying to bring kerosene, or mineral oil emulsion more\r\n    forward as an insecticide. I have given a number of the best\r\n    recipes in one of our leading agricultural journals—“The\r\n    Farmer’s Gazette,” Dublin—with the information that for those\r\n    who cannot manage permanent combination of the constituents, the\r\n    so-called “antipest” makes a good substitute.\r\n\r\n    It appears that “formalin,” as the trade name is called, is\r\n    being brought out as a disinfectant. Mr. A. Zimmermann has been\r\n    trying the effects as an insecticide on greenhouse plants, and\r\n    he considered it so bad for the insects, and beneficial rather\r\n    than hurtful to the plants, that he wanted my co-operation in\r\n    getting it tried. Dr. Bernard Dyer told me he thought it would\r\n    be well worth trial.\r\n\r\n    The point that occurred to me was could we use it against the\r\n    Flour moth, _E. kuhniella_? At present we have got some flour\r\n    well impregnated with emanation from some of the tablets, and\r\n    Mr. Zimmermann was going to have a loaf baked of some of this\r\n    flour, and consumed in his own large household, without letting\r\n    them know there is anything peculiar about it! I am to know\r\n    results; and I have said I should like a piece of the\r\n    experimental loaf. I hope we shall not all be made very\r\n    miserable indeed. If the flour rises properly, and the bread is\r\n    fit to be eaten, then I am meditating getting an experiment made\r\n    as to the destructive powers of the fumes by some of our folks\r\n    here connected with milling, and also suggesting to Mons. J.\r\n    Danysz, Director of the Laboratory of Parasitology, Bourse de\r\n    Commerce, Paris, whether he might care to experiment in some of\r\n    the French mills with which he had been in communication\r\n    regarding destruction of _E. kuhniella_. The chemical is sold in\r\n    tablets like large thick lozenges, and also as a fluid, and, I\r\n    believe, in powder.\r\n\r\n    Enclosed is a little packet of seed of the pink hawkweed, which\r\n    you thought pretty while here last summer, and a few seeds also\r\n    of the white _Lathyrus_ (vetchling). I hope they may remind you\r\n    how welcome your visits here are.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From life; Red spider (outline figure after Koch)—both magnified.\r\n    Infested leaf, natural size.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 52.—GOOSEBERRY AND IVY RED SPIDER, _BRYOBIA PRÆTIOSA_, C.

Who will be his\r\n    successor? Will it be Mr. L. O. Howard, I wonder? I expect that\r\n    Professor Riley (unless he is really very ill) will work at his\r\n    Entomology from morning till night or more.\r\n\r\n    The oak trees have been very severely injured by caterpillars in\r\n    various places. Down near Lymington, Hants, one of my\r\n    correspondents tells me the leafage is stripped so that the\r\n    trees look as if it were the middle of the winter. Aphides also\r\n    are very great pests this year, and we had a bad grass attack of\r\n    them near Newcastle-on-Tyne. They were reported to be spreading\r\n    rapidly from one large field (that is, large for us) of 15 to 20\r\n    acres, so I thought the best advice I could give was to mow the\r\n    field—in the most literal sense, cut off the source of evil.\r\n\r\n    Is it not rather an interesting point to think of—that whether\r\n    the weather be hot and dry, or cold and wet, there are some\r\n    kinds of insect attack which appear to do equally well? The\r\n    crops bear up better in special circumstances, but their\r\n    unpleasant enemies seem to me just as comfortable.\r\n\r\n    I have got a very curious investigation on hand of the mischief\r\n    of some beetles on the grassland of our South American Land Co.\r\n    in the Argentine Territories. I will enclose or send you a\r\n    little note I put in one of our agricultural papers. Is it not\r\n    curious that the two Scarabæid beetles sent over with the\r\n    Dynastids should so rarely come to hand here that there is only\r\n    one specimen of each in our British Museum! I hope to work up\r\n    the observations, or rather, to get a good deal of trustworthy\r\n    observation to work upon, and to get some more specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 16, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I am now writing first of all to ask you kindly to accept a copy\r\n    of the translation by Professor Ainsworth-Davis of Dr. Ritzema\r\n    Bos’s “Agricultural Zoology.” It seems to me a very useful book,\r\n    but I think it is a mistake of Messrs. Chapman & Hall to have so\r\n    arranged it that the price is 6s. This is almost a prohibitory\r\n    price to many who could find 2s. 6d. or 3s. Also, if I had seen\r\n    proof of title I think I would have asked for my name to appear\r\n    in a much more secondary fashion. I should mention this copy is\r\n    one of a few sent me for friends. I did not buy it or I would\r\n    not have enlarged on the price! I have written, by request of\r\n    Professor Davis, a short Introduction, and I was very glad to do\r\n    it to show that I had no feeling of opposition, for much of it\r\n    is on parallel lines with my Manual, and there might have been\r\n    misunderstandings which I should have been very sorry for—for\r\n    Dr. Ritzema Bos is always kind in helping me.\r\n\r\n    You will believe how intensely I was interested in all I could\r\n    hear about Professor Riley’s retirement. I was sorry for his\r\n    indifferent health, but perhaps it was more the desire to be a\r\n    free agent that led to his resignation. I think I could feel\r\n    very much with him, but his was a magnificent post to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 28, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I was shocked and grieved to receive the news of our friend\r\n    Professor Riley’s fatal accident.[74] Dr. Bethune kindly sent me\r\n    a paper with the full account, and as I did not know what any\r\n    one might do in properly announcing it here, I wrote a short\r\n    letter to the “Times” which they inserted at once. This was just\r\n    what one might call a friendly notice; an account of the\r\n    accident and a few observations, the dry obituary notice (I mean\r\n    the regular formal notice) had been inserted the previous day. I\r\n    was very pleased to see yours in the “Canadian Entomologist.” It\r\n    was very sad, and I feel his loss much, for he was always, when\r\n    we corresponded, kind and helpful.\r\n\r\n    Here, things are going on (or standing still) much as usual, but\r\n    it has been a grand year for fresh observations. I have secured\r\n    a long carefully watched observation of _Harpalus ruficornis_\r\n    (Ground beetle) feeding on strawberry fruit. I watched and\r\n    recorded until I got so weary of acting as their fruiterer that\r\n    I thought seventeen days’ observation was enough.\r\n\r\n    Amongst pine attackers I have had a lovely specimen of the\r\n    _Astynomus ædilis_ (Timberman beetle), sent me from the north of\r\n    Scotland, the longest horned of the European “longhorns.” It is\r\n    wonderfully pretty to see the tiny beetle, not three-quarters of\r\n    an inch long, comfortably bearing its delicate antennæ, nearly\r\n    half a foot in expanse. Also I have got a good observation of\r\n    the Pine Shoot moth’s bad doings; the _Retinia buoliana_, the\r\n    “Post-horn” attack as they call it in Germany, from the twisted\r\n    shoots; and some other fresh work—but the great point of this\r\n    year’s observation is Horse and Cattle Diptera, Warble flies,\r\n    Gad flies, and Forest flies. Just now Forest flies are being\r\n    sent me from India. The Indian species is very pretty. I have\r\n    been working up the structure of the Hippoboscal foot, which is\r\n    indeed wonderful (plates XXIII., XXIV.). I do not understand the\r\n    details, so I have had two great drawings made, and\r\n    lithographed, for my next Annual Report, with the tiny foot\r\n    magnified to a size of 6 inches by 5, showing every detail that\r\n    appears to me observable, and I wonder what the parts will be\r\n    considered to do. I think I have made out a good deal, but there\r\n    is some apparatus that none of the few people I have consulted\r\n    make out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Magnified, and lines showing natural length; strawberry fruit gnawed\r\n    by _Harpalus ruficornis_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 53.—GROUND BEETLES—“BAT BEETLE,” _HARPALUS RUFICORNIS_, FAB.\r\n    (left), _PTEROSTICHUS VULGARIS_, LINN.

I trust that\r\n    the exertion and excitement will not be quite too much for her,\r\n    but it will be a great trial.\r\n\r\n    Another matter I feel more at home in—do you happen to have seen\r\n    in some of our English papers that some of us are trying to get\r\n    an Agricultural Lectureship established in the University of\r\n    Oxford? It came about this way. It appears that the funds for\r\n    support of the Sibthorpian Professorship of Rural Economy had\r\n    fallen so low, that it was feared it would have to be given up.\r\n    But the Clothworkers’ Company came forward with the offer of\r\n    £200 a year for five years on condition of Agriculture being\r\n    made one of the subjects to be taken for degrees. I offered £100\r\n    on the same terms, and then it was offered by one or two people\r\n    jointly, on the same terms, to clear off a debt which seemed\r\n    growing like a snowball. The matter is now under consideration\r\n    by the University authorities. They would gladly accept the\r\n    money, I believe, for an Agricultural Lectureship on which\r\n    attendance was voluntary, but the difficulty is accepting the\r\n    matter as essential for a degree.\r\n\r\n    Instruction in agriculture (that is, chemistry, forestry,\r\n    entomology, &c.) would do a great deal of good at such a centre\r\n    of our “coming on” great landholders as Oxford, but the students\r\n    will not attend the lectures unless the matter is compulsory.\r\n    Prof. Warington is the Sibthorpian lecturer—a friend and\r\n    neighbour (at least, he and his wife live very near by\r\n    railway)—so we can talk over progress. He has his hands, I\r\n    think, very full. In case after due consideration Oxford does\r\n    not think it desirable to establish the Chair, I fancy it is\r\n    very likely our offer may be then transferred to Cambridge; but\r\n    this is at present uncertain.\r\n\r\n    [These efforts in the higher interests of science as applied to\r\n    agriculture having failed, Miss Ormerod, in her _Last Will and\r\n    Testament_, bequeathed, out of her ample means, a sum of £5,000\r\n    to the University Court of the University of Edinburgh, “upon\r\n    trust for the benefit of that University.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _December 6, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I thank you very much for your two Entomological Reports lately\r\n    received. I want to read your observations on “Hair-worms”\r\n    carefully as soon as I can get time, for these creatures come, I\r\n    think, as regularly as the summer.\r\n\r\n    You will perhaps have seen the turmoil that the Sparrow-lovers\r\n    raised, and the floods of abuse they bestowed upon me. But it\r\n    advertised the leaflet beautifully, and I could hardly print at\r\n    first quickly enough to keep up to the demand. Our Royal\r\n    Horticultural Society has asked leave to reprint the Sparrow\r\n    leaflet in their Journal, which gratifies me much.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _January 21, 1898._\r\n\r\n    I think you will be pleased to know that I am in most pleasant\r\n    co-operation with the Duke of Bedford’s staff at the Woburn\r\n    Experimental Fruit-ground as to endeavouring to find some way to\r\n    lessen presence of _Phytoptus_ (mite galls), on black-currants.\r\n    We are going to try grafting on species which are not affected,\r\n    for one thing; after I have been trying for I do not know how\r\n    long to get growers to consider having their bushes in line,\r\n    with other crops between, I hear to-day from Woburn that it\r\n    appears as if those which had been grown that way were much the\r\n    freest from attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 16, 1898._\r\n\r\n    We are having an extraordinarily mild winter, and vegetation is\r\n    said in some places to be one or two months over-forward. Of\r\n    course insects are plying their trades heartily underground, but\r\n    (so far) I do not see any difference in amount of above-ground\r\n    appearances. If this is so generally, would it be too\r\n    far-fetched an idea to think it was a still further confirmation\r\n    of hibernation being constitutional, not an effect of weather?\r\n    The underground workers that are sent me are larval “eaters”\r\n    when not frozen torpid; also _Tylenchus devastatrix_ (eel-worm)\r\n    is, I believe, making wild work with clover, which is popularly\r\n    attributed to _Sitones_ (Pea-weevil) larvæ. I found the little\r\n    eel-worm (fig. 47) in quantities in abortive shoots of\r\n    “stem-sick” clover sent me, and I am giving warning about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _January 7, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am very much gratified that you approve of the Index to my\r\n    Annual Reports. You will believe that it was a weary work to\r\n    make up our minds what arrangement would be desirable. The time\r\n    and sight that I worse than wasted on it was incredible, for, I\r\n    believe, I really complicated matters very much, and doctor, and\r\n    business manager (Mr. T. P. Newman) spoke so seriously that I\r\n    left off meddling, and I think Mr. Newstead did the work well.\r\n\r\n    I now very gladly forward a copy by book post, and I should be\r\n    only too pleased to send any copies that may be desired. My hope\r\n    is that besides being just a paged reference list, it may stand\r\n    for a sort of up-to-date “catalogue raisonné” of British\r\n    Economic Insect attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _June 12, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I have owed you an answer to your kind letter so long that on\r\n    receipt this evening of your very valuable pamphlet, which I am\r\n    delighted to possess, I sit down at once to write.\r\n\r\n    I promise myself a great deal of information from your “Recent\r\n    Additions,” which is obviously of quite exceptional value. What\r\n    you say of the number of injurious insects being greater, as\r\n    well as the number of species, is very interesting. I am hoping\r\n    to utilise the reports of forest insects which have been sent me\r\n    up to date, in co-operation with Dr. R. Stewart MacDougall, the\r\n    consulting Entomologist of the Highland and Agricultural Society\r\n    of Scotland. I have much information scattered in my Annual\r\n    Reports, but I have not strength to work it and attend at the\r\n    same time (as I wish to do) to regular application, so we are\r\n    thinking that, as a “Text-book of Forestry” is much needed for\r\n    University use, we might work together; that is, Dr. MacDougall\r\n    to take the heavy scientific part, as his engagements allow, and\r\n    I to add what I can to the entomological notes which he has been\r\n    collecting for years, and also give the figures. I should like\r\n    this collaboration very much. Mr. Robert Wallace, the Professor\r\n    of Agriculture in the Edinburgh University (an old friend of\r\n    mine), is a very kind ally, and now I do not feel so very lonely\r\n    in my work. By parcel post (posted with this letter) I am\r\n    sending a photo of myself, taken in Doctor’s robes, for your\r\n    kind acceptance; I hope you will approve of the appearance of\r\n    your old friend in her new dress! With very kind remembrances\r\n    and good wishes, pray believe me, ever sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                           ELEANOR A. ORMEROD, LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _To the Rev.

BETHUNE,—My sister and myself were indeed grieved\r\n    and shocked to see from the papers you kindly sent (received\r\n    yesterday morning) what a disaster had happened.[75] What a\r\n    mercy that all the boys were saved! The order and promptness\r\n    speak volumes for the spirit of obedience and discipline—and we\r\n    have been reading the whole history with the greatest sympathy\r\n    and admiration. Poor boys—I feel so sorry for them—running out\r\n    into the cold, to watch their pet collections and treasures\r\n    burning!\r\n\r\n    I gather that for building purposes you are fairly insured, but\r\n    will you let my sister and myself try to replace what we can of\r\n    our own books and drawings? We are writing up to Messrs.\r\n    Johnston to ask how best to forward my sister’s and my five sets\r\n    of Insect diagrams, which were published by our Royal\r\n    Agricultural Society. When we learn, she is going to have them\r\n    forwarded, and hopes you will kindly accept them as a little\r\n    token of her great sympathy. By this post I am sending, in two\r\n    book post parcels, my Manual (2nd edit.), “Cobham Journals,”[76]\r\n    and Annual Reports, vols. 13, 14, 15, 16, 18. These I have here,\r\n    and I am going to write to my printers to forward some more to\r\n    try and make up the set. Kindly accept these, and please excuse\r\n    the “Cobham Journals” not being absolutely new. But it has long\r\n    been out of print and I secured a presentation copy which was\r\n    offered for sale and had it bound, and put a strip of paper to\r\n    hide what might be on the title-page.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Fletcher is my chief Canadian correspondent, and it is a\r\n    great delight when I get a letter from him.\r\n\r\n    You will not have time at present to think of entomological\r\n    matters, but we were desirous to assure you as soon as possible\r\n    of our great sympathy in your trouble. With my very kind regards\r\n    to yourself and Mrs. Bethune, in which my sister begs to join\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _June 7, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I was very much pleased to see your handwriting again a short\r\n    time ago—and a little while before exceedingly gratified with\r\n    the long kind review. You, living among so many friends and\r\n    colleagues in work, can hardly appreciate how very greatly\r\n    indeed I value such kind encouragement.\r\n\r\n    Your beautiful letter was a great support and comfort to me in\r\n    my loss last year,[77] and now my health is fairly established\r\n    again. I had great trouble for many weeks, some months rather,\r\n    from some very troublesome disturbance of sight, but I did as\r\n    well as I could, and when circumstances allowed, I got one of\r\n    our best London oculists to come and see what was amiss. To my\r\n    great joy he told me that each of my eyes individually was in\r\n    excellent order, but there was some such difference in their\r\n    action that some special glasses were needed, and I find great\r\n    comfort from them. He said he wondered how I had been able to\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    Just now Alfalfa (lucerne), infested with locusts is coming in\r\n    from Buenos Aires, and one of my correspondents found his horses\r\n    so ill after feeding on the infested lucerne, that I sent a copy\r\n    of his notes to our “Live Stock Journal.”\r\n\r\n    One of the three animals was reported to appear to suffer from\r\n    colic; another recovered when bran was substituted for the\r\n    locust-infested hay. The third I should conjecture was very ill\r\n    when I heard. But as I know nothing of veterinary matters, I\r\n    thought it was but right to send the notes on, with a kind of\r\n    apology. The locusts are of the South American migratory\r\n    kind—_Schistocerca paranensis_. Pretty creatures—even all\r\n    flattened out. My correspondent sent me about 120 of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Locust with wings spread: tip of male abdomen to the right, and of\r\n    female abdomen to the left.

I am trying to include all the attacks\r\n    of any real importance of which observations have been sent to\r\n    me in the past twenty-one years, and though I give these from\r\n    British observations to a great extent, I am trying to bring\r\n    them all up to date. I hope you approve of the idea. Our fruit\r\n    industry is increasing so much, that more information is needed\r\n    for growers; but I do not feel sure I should have had courage to\r\n    begin it, if some one had not written to me that he purposed\r\n    bringing out a book on insect pests, and would like the use of\r\n    my figures to illustrate it! It occurred to me that when he was\r\n    about it he might like my letterpress also! So I have set to\r\n    work and I have got to about p. 224.\r\n\r\n    There are more of the rarer attacks about than usual this\r\n    year—_Atomaria linearis_ at mangolds, for instance. This morning\r\n    I heard from Messrs. Laxton, of Bedford, that they have gained a\r\n    complete victory over that destructive pest, the Strawberry\r\n    ground beetle, or beetles, I should say (in this instance\r\n    cockchafers, fig. 58). They bought a multitude of pudding basins\r\n    and sunk them in the strawberry beds, baited with sugar and\r\n    water, and tempting solids, and the beetles were caught in\r\n    hosts, sometimes by the half basin full. I think this is real\r\n    good news for strawberry growers.\r\n\r\n    I wish I knew better how to manage my work. I do not think I\r\n    should have any difficulty in keeping the real work in hand, but\r\n    there is so much correspondence on subjects which, indeed, one\r\n    can hardly call even allied, and yet I suppose one should return\r\n    a reply, and that adds uselessly to the work. How well you must\r\n    know this sort of thing!\r\n\r\n    I was grieved at the loss of our kind Dr. Lintner,[78] and I saw\r\n    my good friend Mr. T. P. Newman about some not wholly inadequate\r\n    notice being inserted in the “Entomologist.” I could from my\r\n    heart record his exceeding kindness to his weaker brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Magnified; natural length, one twenty-fourth of an inch.\r\n  (After Taschenberg.)\r\n\r\n  FIG. 56.—PIGMY MANGOLD BEETLE, _ATOMARIA LINEARIS_, STEPHENS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 28, 1899._\r\n\r\n    Your very kind letter to me of a few weeks back was a sincere\r\n    grief to me in its information of your abiding sorrow under the\r\n    heavy affliction with which it has pleased our Father to visit\r\n    you.[79] I scarcely know how to write to you, for it would be\r\n    presumptuous in me to endeavour to enter to you on the only\r\n    sources of consolation, which, in my own great loss, you placed\r\n    so comfortably before me; but, believe me, I earnestly\r\n    sympathise in your affliction, and earnestly hope that any\r\n    arrangement you make may be to your comfort. I am much pleased\r\n    to see in the paper of which you have kindly sent me a copy,\r\n    that great care is being taken, that, so far as may be, you\r\n    shall have a worthy successor in the office you have so\r\n    honourably held for so many years [Head Master of Trinity\r\n    College School, Port Hope].\r\n\r\n    I do not often hear from Canada, for Dr. Fletcher is so occupied\r\n    and has to move about so much, that he has not time to give me\r\n    the bits of entomological novelties he used to form most\r\n    interesting letters with. I am trying this season to get my\r\n    applicants to fill up their observations to some degree. Rather\r\n    an undertaking this, you will believe!

RITZEMA BOS,—I have not written to you for a long time,\r\n    partly because I had nothing of sufficient importance to allow\r\n    me to submit it to you, but also because both my sister and\r\n    myself had rather severe illnesses.\r\n\r\n    Enclosed I beg to send you some pieces of potato, which I think\r\n    it is just possible may be infested by (or at least have now)\r\n    some slight presence of _Tylenchus devastatrix_ (eel-worm, fig.\r\n    47). I received several tubers this morning from near\r\n    Helensburgh, in Dumbartonshire, Scotland. Mr. Robert Howie, the\r\n    sender, writes me that a large field recently dug up by him was\r\n    very much damaged by being badly “scabbed” in the same way as\r\n    the samples sent. But, when I came to examine the so-called\r\n    “scabbed” parts after washing, the surface for the most part\r\n    looked to me more as if it had been gnawed by some larvæ, than\r\n    if it were a diseased state of coat. The skin of the potato is\r\n    often left overhanging. I was going to suggest to Mr. Howie that\r\n    he should search for _Agrotis_ larvæ, or _Melolontha_\r\n    (Cockchafer), grubs, but examining further at the end of one or\r\n    two tubers, where the skin was still in its natural state,\r\n    excepting small patches of what was as yet only a slight\r\n    discoloured roughness, I found a few eel-worms. They were so few\r\n    that they evaded me when using the higher power, but in one\r\n    instance I thought I detected a bulb near the head end. I am\r\n    afraid I may be taking up your time with what is of no\r\n    importance; still I thought I should like to send you some\r\n    pieces, and if the attack is one of any interest I would gladly\r\n    forward more. The eel-worms I have seen are all anguilliform,\r\n    the largest was about as long or longer than the largest _T.\r\n    devastatrix_ I have seen, the others were smaller. Mr. Rochford\r\n    has been carrying on with great care and precision his\r\n    experiments as to poisoning _Heterodera radicicola_ (root-knott\r\n    eel-worms, fig. 49). He has tried about forty different\r\n    applications—noting the amount given and the effect on the\r\n    eel-worms and the plants. I certainly hope that a few will show\r\n    successful results, but he is very careful, and is now going\r\n    over his series of experiments a second time, that he may be\r\n    quite certain before coming forward with statements of effects.\r\n    As soon as I know anything of interest I shall be very glad to\r\n    be allowed to tell you; Mr. Rochford has given me permission. I\r\n    do not know as yet whether he will bring forward his results\r\n    himself, or leave it to me to do. Pray believe me, with best\r\n    thanks for all the kind assistance you give me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Larva, pupa, and antenna of male ♂ and female ♀.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.—COCKCHAFER, _MELOLONTHA VULGARIS_, FAB.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _September 7, 1893._\r\n\r\n    As I think that you have either returned home, or will soon be\r\n    returning, I now (with your kind permission) send a few more of\r\n    the “scabbed” potatoes, which it seemed possible might be\r\n    infested by _Tylenchus devastatrix_. If it should be convenient\r\n    to you at your best leisure to make any examination, and to let\r\n    me know results, I am sure I need not say how acceptable your\r\n    information would be, not only to myself, but to many interested\r\n    in the cause of this external deformity. I send the potatoes in\r\n    a little tin box by parcel post. Recently I have had rather an\r\n    interesting observation of the little black, somewhat pubescent,\r\n    “lady-bird” beetle, _Scymnus minimus_, as a feeder on Red\r\n    spider, _Tetranychus telarius_. I have not been able to find any\r\n    account of its life history, so I have had great pleasure in\r\n    watching its progress from larval to imago state. It seems to me\r\n    to be greedily carnivorous; after a few hours’ want of food\r\n    during their journey to me, the larvæ set to work to feed on\r\n    what they could pick up on the back of a leaf infested by red\r\n    spider, as eagerly as sheep on fresh grass; and as I found one\r\n    day only a single larva remaining of three or four confined\r\n    together, I suspect it was this survivor who had reduced his\r\n    brethren to the small remains which were all I found. The final\r\n    changes were rapid, for the above happened on August 28th, and\r\n    shortly after it had pupated, and yesterday I found the little\r\n    black lady-bird in most active condition.\r\n\r\n    I have heard nothing further at present from Mr. Rochford about\r\n    his _Heterodera_ experiments. I think I must remind him soon\r\n    that he kindly promised me a report.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Cluster of eggs; 2, egg, magnified; 3, grub, magnified; 4, line\r\n    showing natural length; 5 and 6, pupæ; 7 and 8, 2-spotted lady-bird,\r\n    _Coccinella bipunctata_, L.

I was afraid you\r\n    might think I was not attending to these subjects, but now I\r\n    have received a cucumber root quite beset with galls, of which I\r\n    forward you a portion. It is from a nursery gardener at Rhyl, in\r\n    Flintshire, North Wales, where they are much troubled by\r\n    cucumber and tomato plants dying, some of both kinds having the\r\n    “roots covered with galls but some have not.” Messrs. Maxwell\r\n    and Dalgliesh sent me some of the roots without galls, from\r\n    plants that were nearly dead, but I could not discover the cause\r\n    of the failure of these. On such inefficient examination as I\r\n    make, I find in the soft pulpy centre of the larger galls some\r\n    anguilliform nematodes, which I conjecture to be males, or\r\n    larvæ, of the _H. radicicola_, but so far as I searched I did\r\n    not find females; there were a fair number of eggs. On cutting\r\n    the pieces of plant into fragments for packing I find the stem\r\n    just about the ground-level much beset with diseased growth. I\r\n    have not, however, delayed to try to examine this, for I might\r\n    be only wasting specimens. Messrs. M. and D. have five houses\r\n    fifty yards long each, so the infestation is a serious trouble\r\n    to them. They tell me that they clear out all the soil each\r\n    year, and bring fresh soil in. It “is rich alluvial soil.” They\r\n    have tried lime, soot, and nitrate of soda without effect, and I\r\n    should certainly say that something requires alteration for the\r\n    extermination even of an infestation much more easily dealt\r\n    with; for they are troubled by millepedes (fig. 27), and also\r\n    there are such great numbers of _Geophilus_ (centipedes), that\r\n    there must, I think, be something amiss whether these live\r\n    chiefly on vegetable matter or on small animal vermin.\r\n\r\n    Some inquiry about _H. radicicola_ has been sent to me from Glen\r\n    St. Mary, Florida, U.S.A., but no new information.\r\n\r\n    On Saturday, Professor Ainsworth-Davis wrote to ask me to write\r\n    a preface to his translation of your “Zoologie,” and it will\r\n    gratify me very much indeed to prepare such a one as I hope may\r\n    please you. Your book will be a very valuable addition to our\r\n    educational series, and I shall like very much to be permitted\r\n    thus to appear in colleagueship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _October 3, 1894._\r\n\r\n    This matter of the ? _Tylenchus devastatrix_ in the cortex seems\r\n    to me most perplexingly curious. I cannot venture to form an\r\n    opinion; I have not the knowledge requisite, but looking at\r\n    these _Tylenchi_ being smaller than _T. devastatrix_ is\r\n    customarily known to be, and also their occurring in a locality\r\n    where _devastatrix_ is not known, the idea just floats in my\r\n    mind whether they may be ♂ (males) or, alternatively, larval\r\n    _Heterodera schachtii_ (“Beet-root” eel-worm).\r\n\r\n    But perhaps I am almost wrong in taking up your time with a mere\r\n    idea, as you work on definite proof, and though the shape of\r\n    those I mentioned to you much resembled your larval _H.\r\n    schachtii_, I had not sufficiently high powers to be sure of the\r\n    species. I have been trying to make out whether there is ever a\r\n    definitely formed opening for the exit of the contents of the\r\n    ♀(female) _schachtii_. In examining one specimen I found a\r\n    circular orifice with what appeared to me a regularly formed\r\n    edge—not a merely torn one. On putting this in glycerine under a\r\n    thin cover-glass, and very lightly pressing it, there first came\r\n    out a number of little eel-worms, without disturbing the\r\n    condition of the orifice. I was, however, so desirous that my\r\n    sister should see the interesting sight that I called her, and\r\n    when I looked again perhaps in a couple of minutes, the\r\n    regularity was gone; the outer skin—the skin rather of the\r\n    female—was cracking irregularly from the aperture and giving\r\n    exit to a mixed collection of eggs and wormlets. I have tried to\r\n    find another instance but without success. Very many thanks to\r\n    you for also sparing time to explain to me the meaning of the\r\n    word “schaŭmerde.”[80] Now I quite understand and am very glad\r\n    to know about it. Thank you also for your kind permission to use\r\n    some of your figures of _schachtii_.\r\n\r\n    I should very much like to have some specimens of the hop-growth\r\n    called “nettle-headed,” but I have only received a very few\r\n    leaves, in which I did not see anything amiss.\r\n\r\n    I received a specimen (though I suppose this is not rare) of the\r\n    large _Coccinella ocellata_ (Eyed lady-bird). What a pretty\r\n    creature it is! I had never seen it before.\r\n\r\n    Also from a North British correspondent I received a number of\r\n    what I do not think could be other than larvæ of one of the\r\n    _Staphylinidæ_, which were doing mischief by feeding in turnips\r\n    or their flower stems or leafstalks. They looked grey to the\r\n    unassisted eye; magnified, they were whitish with grey patches\r\n    along the back, and they much resembled the fig. by Professor\r\n    Westwood (see p. 167 of vol. i. of his “Classification of\r\n    Insects”), of which I give a rough tracing of the magnified\r\n    larva and line showing natural size. Professor Westwood found\r\n    numbers of these larvæ feeding on turnips, but, unfortunately,\r\n    he does not give even the generic name. They are obviously very\r\n    destructive, that is, those sent me.\r\n\r\n    I have been most carefully studying your observations on\r\n    _schachtii_ in oats with great pleasure and profit. With kind\r\n    regards and ever with many thanks, believe me,\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A.

But I\r\n    trust you will forgive my long silence because for a long time\r\n    (that is, since last autumn) until about three weeks ago, I have\r\n    been a great sufferer, and it has been with difficulty I have\r\n    been able to keep up to work.\r\n\r\n    May I ask your kind acceptance of my fifteenth Report\r\n    (accompanying by book post), and a little brochure I recently\r\n    arranged by special request; also with them may I place a copy\r\n    of my portrait, recently taken,in your hands? I value your\r\n    pamphlets which you kindly send me, much; but, unfortunately, I\r\n    have never been able to master your language—so when I have read\r\n    the title, if it be a subject bearing specially on my own work,\r\n    I get help from a linguist to enable me to benefit. Trusting\r\n    that for the reasons given you will pardon my long silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 25, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I thank you very much for being so good as to tell me of the\r\n    appearance of the _Cecidomyia destructor_ (Hessian fly, fig. 15)\r\n    in Norway. This observation of the further spread of this\r\n    troublesome barley pest is very interesting to me, and I am also\r\n    greatly obliged to you for letting me have the characteristic\r\n    specimens of _puparia_. There is no doubt that these are the\r\n    chrysalis cases (the “flax-seeds,” as we call them here) of the\r\n    Hessian fly. I at once wrote to two friends to endeavour to\r\n    procure the specimens you name, and it would have been a great\r\n    pleasure to me to send them at once, but I much doubt whether I\r\n    shall be able to procure any of the Wheat midge, _C. tritici_; I\r\n    have not got any myself, nor have my two colleagues so far as\r\n    they see.\r\n\r\n    About the Hessian fly, I have been more successful. I have\r\n    secured some specimens well put up for the microscope. It is too\r\n    late this evening to repack them properly, but I hope to send\r\n    you three slides to-morrow in a registered letter, of which,\r\n    with very great pleasure, I beg your kind acceptance. Should\r\n    they not reach you in proper condition, you will oblige me by\r\n    letting me know, that I may try to replace them. I should hope\r\n    that the thoroughly well-advised treatment which you are\r\n    endeavouring to get carried out in the infested district will be\r\n    successful. I have great confidence in the efficacy of\r\n    destroying the _puparia_ in the screenings or siftings; and\r\n    ploughing so as to turn down the “flax-seeds” also quite\r\n    certainly answers well.\r\n\r\n    One special insect trouble during the past season in this\r\n    country has been an unusual prevalence of wasps, _Vespidæ_, of\r\n    various species. They caused much injury and loss by destroying\r\n    fruit, and also were very troublesome by attacking horses\r\n    ploughing, if their nests were turned up. I hear that they were\r\n    also troublesome in Holland, and in the Hartz districts of\r\n    Germany. Should you write to me, I should be very much\r\n    interested to know whether they were also unusually plentiful in\r\n    Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, 6, infested floret; 2, 3, larvæ; 4, 5, cased larva or pupa, natural\r\n    size and magnified; 7, 8, part of horns, magnified; 9, 10, wheat\r\n    midge; and 11-14, ichneumon parasites, natural size and magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 62.—WHEAT MIDGE, _CECIDOMYIA TRITICI_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _November 7, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I beg to offer you my best thanks for your very acceptable\r\n    letter of the 31st of October. Indeed, I am greatly obliged to\r\n    you for not only kindly giving me your own information as to\r\n    amount of wasp presence observed in the past season, but also\r\n    the translation into English of the account of their great\r\n    appearance at Tromsö in 1883-4. This is exceedingly interesting,\r\n    and also very entertaining. I have enjoyed reading this spirited\r\n    account uncommonly, and I shall like very much to add it (of\r\n    course duly acknowledged) to my paper on wasps in my next Annual\r\n    Report.\r\n\r\n    [The translation appeared as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “In the years 1883-1884, there was an unusual prevalence of them\r\n    in the Arctic Norway, especially at Tromsö and other islands in\r\n    the vicinity. Mr. J. S. Schneider, Conservator at Tromsö Museum,\r\n    writes in the Swedish ‘Entomologisk Tidskrift,’ 1885, pp. 148,\r\n    149, about this matter as follows:—‘Who can tell all the tears\r\n    which these wicked animals have squeezed from the poor children,\r\n    or the swearings which the mowers have thrown out, the half-shut\r\n    eyes, and the swollen hands and cheeks which have shown forth in\r\n    the autumn months of these two years? Perhaps this may appear an\r\n    exaggeration, but it comes, however, pretty near the truth. They\r\n    built their nests everywhere, in the earth, in stone walls,\r\n    behind the wainscottings of the houses, under garden benches, on\r\n    the trees; it swarmed with wasps on all the flowers and bushes,\r\n    the windows were filled with them, they crawled on the plates of\r\n    the dining-tables, licked of the dishes with preserves, crawled\r\n    under the clothings, and in the hair, and did not at all spare\r\n    the ladies! When one was going in the woods, a humming warbling\r\n    was heard, which is still sounding in my ears; wasps everywhere,\r\n    it was almost a despair,’ &c.\r\n\r\n    “I have not seen anywhere in the southern districts of our\r\n    country the wasps so exceedingly numerous as they must have been\r\n    in Tromsö in the said years. The species occurring here are:\r\n    _Vespa crabro_, _media_, _saxonica_, and var. _norvegica_,\r\n    _holsatica_, _vulgaris_, _germanica_, _rufa_, and _Pseudovespa\r\n    austriaca_.” (W. M. S.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     _November 7, 1893 (continued)._\r\n\r\n    Now I have much pleasure in begging your acceptance of a few\r\n    pamphlets sent accompanying by book post—three on Hessian fly\r\n    and one on Paris-green. Two of the Hessian fly pamphlets were\r\n    condensed notes regarding its first appearance here, the other a\r\n    report in full of the communications of my correspondents. I\r\n    wished very much to send you a similar detailed report of the\r\n    first year’s observations of this _Cecidomyia destructor_ (fig.\r\n    15) in Britain, but as yet I have not been able to find one\r\n    remaining. Every year since the first appearance of this\r\n    infestation amongst us, I have received some amount of\r\n    information as to its greater or less presence, and I have\r\n    given, so far as I could, my best attention to it. If it should\r\n    happen that there is any point on which you would wish a reply\r\n    to any inquiries, I would with pleasure do my best to answer\r\n    fully, and would think myself honoured, as well as be very much\r\n    pleased to be in communication with you on the above subject, or\r\n    any other point of injurious insect presence.\r\n\r\n    [On the subject of wasps, Miss Ormerod wrote to Mr. Edward\r\n    Connold on January 15, 1894:—\r\n\r\n    “I am very glad that you were able to procure my late brother’s\r\n    book on “Social Wasps” and that its perusal gave you pleasure.\r\n    You ask me how the combs were removed from the nests. I do not\r\n    know how my brother managed it, but I found the matter very\r\n    easy, as long as the nests had been so recently taken from\r\n    out-of-door localities, that the paper had not become too dry to\r\n    be operated on. Indeed, the damp condition induced by the first\r\n    stages of the very nasty state that combs with dead grubs get\r\n    into, rather facilitated work than otherwise. The first thing in\r\n    working on a nest of any size was to get a pair of scissors,\r\n    long in the blades, thin, and also very sharp. Then carefully\r\n    make a clean vertical cut through the paper-case of the nest\r\n    from the entrance below nearly to the top. Through this great\r\n    gash I had no difficulty in removing the combs—so to say\r\n    (although it is a disagreeable word) “eviscerating” the nest. I\r\n    began with the smallest and lowest comb. Inserting my scissors\r\n    horizontally I snipped through the little paper pillars by which\r\n    it was connected with the comb above and withdrew it in a very\r\n    convenient way, with fingers or forceps (or very likely by help\r\n    of the scissors) through the opening. Continuing this process I\r\n    do not remember that I ever failed to clear out the comb\r\n    successfully. It did not always require to be entirely removed,\r\n    if I recollect rightly. I think sometimes the upper comb did not\r\n    require removal. When all was cleared out, I filled the empty\r\n    paper case with cotton wool, and applying plenty of gum to this\r\n    below the slit, I very gently pressed the paper back to its\r\n    former position, and if the work had been dexterously done, the\r\n    injury did not show much. If the paper had been broken of course\r\n    the damage showed, and it was requisite to be careful that the\r\n    gum or adhesive mixture used for keeping the cut edges in their\r\n    places did not run about. Sometimes where circumstances\r\n    permitted, I cut a little aside from the straight line in places\r\n    so as to secure an uninjured piece of a layer to hide part of\r\n    the slit. In this way very pretty specimens could be arranged,\r\n    showing both nest and comb. I have been preparing a long paper\r\n    on the wasp attack of last year for my next Annual Report. I\r\n    have had very good contributions, and hope it may be liked.\r\n\r\n    “It will give me great pleasure to attend to any inquiry the\r\n    Hon. Sec. of the Museum may care to send me as to starting a\r\n    collection of pests to agriculture, and I think I might be able\r\n    to help with suggestions where specimens are procurable.\r\n\r\n    “Many thanks for your suggestion as to membership, but I do not\r\n    care to belong to more Societies than I can possibly help, so I\r\n    hope you will forgive my not accepting your kind offer.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  After sketch from original specimen by E.

SCHÖYEN,—In reply to your inquiry whether any measures\r\n    are being taken in this country to prevent the introduction of\r\n    the San José Scale, _Aspidiotus perniciosus_, I am not aware of\r\n    any such measures being in contemplation. I have not heard of\r\n    anything of the kind being proposed, nor have I seen any mention\r\n    in our newspapers of preventive measures being contemplated in\r\n    regard to imports. My own impression is that we are not likely\r\n    to suffer from it. With our island climate (as a general thing,\r\n    and as especially observed by Dr. C. V. Riley) the injurious\r\n    insects of the Continent of America rarely establish themselves\r\n    here, although ours adapt themselves to the American Continental\r\n    circumstances, and this Scale appears to be remarkably\r\n    susceptible to damp and cold. The Bulletin by Dr. John B. Smith,\r\n    Entomologist of the New Jersey Experimental Station, published\r\n    November 27, 1897, says, p. 6, “The Scale does best with us in\r\n    dry, warm weather. It does not like dampness, nor shade, and\r\n    will die out in a cold, moist locality. Large trees with dense\r\n    foliage are therefore least troubled, and a dense mass of\r\n    vegetation shading the ground completely will be infested only\r\n    towards the tips of the twigs or branches nearer the surface,\r\n    where sunlight and air are most abundant.” I greatly hope,\r\n    therefore, that even if this injurious attack should come, that\r\n    it will not establish itself to a serious extent, as shade is a\r\n    characteristic of many of our orchards.\r\n\r\n    Our chief trouble at present is an attack of eel-worms,\r\n    _Tylenchus devastatrix_, on red clover, _Trifolium pratense_,\r\n    causing what we call “Clover-stem sickness.” I never knew the\r\n    attack so widely prevalent before. But I hope that with the\r\n    measures which I draw attention to in my recent Annual Report we\r\n    may do some good.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 11, 1898._\r\n\r\n    Relatively to the San José Scale, I find, from some information\r\n    received this morning, that Mr. R. Newstead, Curator of the\r\n    Grosvenor Museum, Chester, has lately attended by request at the\r\n    Board of Agriculture, and stated that this infestation had not\r\n    established itself in any way in this country. Also that he had\r\n    not heard of, nor had he seen any instances of its presence,\r\n    although he had made diligent search for it at Liverpool, &c. He\r\n    thinks the matter is a “scare,” and that the insect is not\r\n    likely to establish itself here. In this opinion (the document\r\n    before me states) he is supported by our Entomological Society.\r\n    Mr. Newstead is, I believe, excellently qualified to form an\r\n    opinion on the subject, as he is a practical Economic\r\n    Entomologist, and he has also made the _Coccidæ_ a subject of\r\n    minute investigation. This I should say was more important than\r\n    the views of a meeting of our Entomological Society, of whom\r\n    few, if any (excepting Mr. Douglas), have, so far as I am aware,\r\n    studied _Coccidæ_ to an extent approaching Mr. Newstead’s\r\n    observations, and have no special bias towards applied\r\n    Entomology.\r\n\r\n    The above will perhaps be of some interest to you as the nearest\r\n    approach I am able to make to a reply to your inquiry, and I beg\r\n    you to believe me.\r\n\r\n                                                        Yours truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _To Dr. Enzio Reuter, Helsingfors, Finland._\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS, ENGLAND,\r\n                                                 _October 15, 1894_.\r\n\r\n    SIR,—In acknowledging receipt of your obliging letter of the 8th\r\n    of October, received here on the 12th, permit me to say that I\r\n    think it not only a pleasure, but an honour, to be in\r\n    communication with the leading Entomologists who, like yourself,\r\n    are working for the good of their countries. I thank you much\r\n    for your letter.\r\n\r\n    First, about the _Cecidomyia_ (Wheat midge) larvæ (fig. 62) on\r\n    the _Alopecurus pratensis_[81] (Foxtail grass), I cannot\r\n    remember that any further observations were sent me about it,\r\n    nor have I noticed anything in publications which come to my\r\n    hands. My correspondents often send me specimens and details of\r\n    some infestation which has caught their attention, but it is\r\n    with the greatest difficulty in many instances that I can induce\r\n    them to continue their observations for successive seasons, and\r\n    the development of the imagines of the _Cecidomyiæ_ from the\r\n    early condition is much more trouble than they care to take.\r\n\r\n    By book post accompanying this letter I forward to your kind\r\n    acceptance a copy of my seventeenth Report. In the pages of the\r\n    Report I have placed copies of various leaflets. These, you will\r\n    see at a glance, are not at all scientific, but intended quite\r\n    for popular use by our farmers, therefore I have used the very\r\n    simplest words I could.\r\n\r\n    You are good enough to offer to send me copies of some of your\r\n    future reports in connection with Economic Entomology. If you\r\n    can spare them I should value them very much. For although I am\r\n    not able to understand more than a word here and there, yet with\r\n    the help of the dictionary I can make out enough to see whether\r\n    your information is applicable to the conditions here, and I can\r\n    get a good translation made for me. I can read German and\r\n    French, but I am sorry not to be able to write with ease in\r\n    either language.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 21, 1894._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,—I had much pleasure in receiving your kind letter\r\n    yesterday, and also beg you to receive my very hearty thanks for\r\n    your kind and valuable gift of so many of your writings received\r\n    on the day before. But now I am going to ask you a further\r\n    favour. At your leisure would you oblige me with the name of a\r\n    dictionary which would help me to understand them? I do not\r\n    understand Norwegian, but, with the help of the Dano-Norwegian\r\n    dictionary of Mons. A. Larsen, I can manage to make out what I\r\n    especially need from Dr. Schöyen’s writings, which he is so good\r\n    as to send me. But now I have been trying to translate your few\r\n    lines on _Charæas graminis_ (Antler moth) (chap. XIII.), and\r\n    either from my own ignorance, which I much regret, or from not\r\n    having the right dictionary, I have not been able to read them.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—It pleases me very much to hear from you that you approve\r\n    of my reports, and it is kind of you to mention it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 11, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I thank you most heartily for sending me this useful dictionary.\r\n    It is just what I was needing. With this help I can already make\r\n    out short pieces of your reports and publications, which is a\r\n    great pleasure and profit to me. It really was quite a vexation\r\n    to see what I wanted so much to study and yet could hardly make\r\n    out any connected meaning. I only just write now to say that\r\n    both for your kind and helpful gift and your letter accompanying\r\n    I thank you most heartily.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 5, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I did not at once acknowledge your Report on Injurious Insects\r\n    which you have sent me because I thought very likely you would\r\n    send me a few lines about mine, and now I beg to acknowledge\r\n    your note with many thanks. What a vast sum it is that you\r\n    mention as the loss [about 5,000,000 Finn. Marks = ca. £200,000,\r\n    in the years 1889-1891] caused by _Charæas graminis_, Antler\r\n    moth (fig. 4)! I am so sorry that I am not able to read your\r\n    reports, which, from the little bits I can pick out here and\r\n    there, are, I see, so valuable and would help me so much. But\r\n    please not to think that they are wasted on me, for I learn a\r\n    great deal that helps me, and when there is something that I\r\n    particularly wish to know I get the passages translated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 8, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I beg that you will never for one minute think of taking up your\r\n    valuable time in writing to me at length about my reports. If\r\n    you can at any time (as you have so nicely done in your letter\r\n    received to-day) tell me that you think them serviceable, this\r\n    is a most pleasant encouragement, for which I am grateful, but I\r\n    know well what a tax it would be to write letters, so to say,\r\n    merely for compliment. Pray believe me, I should indeed be sorry\r\n    thus to trouble you. I value your writings that you are good\r\n    enough to send me very much, and I got a serviceable Swedish\r\n    grammar and studied it when I could get time, so I can make out\r\n    a little now; at least so much that I can see where what I wish\r\n    particularly to understand is, and get it properly translated.\r\n    Accompanying I have much pleasure in sending two copies of my\r\n    little brochure on Paris-green. I thought perhaps M., your\r\n    brother professor, Odo M. Reuter, whose pamphlet on _C.\r\n    graminis_ I have studied with much benefit, might care to have\r\n    one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 21, 1895._\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for kindly giving me a copy of your work on the\r\n    “Zwei neue Cecidomyinen,” which I am very glad to possess. Your\r\n    minute description will be a most valuable assistance in\r\n    identification. This year I have only had one report of presence\r\n    of _C. destructor_, but there has been a great deal of insect\r\n    presence, and sometimes of kinds not often observed here.\r\n\r\n    But the chief point of general interest, I think, has been what\r\n    to do about the _Hippobosca equina_ (Forest fly, fig. 18),\r\n    relative to some of our military manœuvres in the New Forest,\r\n    which is its especial English locality. I do not know whether\r\n    you have the infestation so far north as your country? It is\r\n    very troublesome at times here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 18, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I should be very glad to help you if I could by reference to\r\n    publications on “Silver-top” or “White-eared” wheat, but I am\r\n    not aware of anything having been written on it in this country\r\n    excepting my own short and meagre notes in my twelfth Annual\r\n    Report, for 1888. Specimens are sent me occasionally, but—as by\r\n    the time that the top of the wheat (or grass) has faded so as to\r\n    draw attention to the injury, the insect, if insect was there,\r\n    has gone—I have never been able to identify the cause of the\r\n    mischief with any approach to certainty. I conjecture the cause\r\n    to be the presence of some species of thrips. The American\r\n    observations point to this, but these you probably are well\r\n    acquainted with (and, indeed, it is not these you are inquiring\r\n    about). In my notes I mention the peculiar manner in which the\r\n    injured upper part of the stem can be withdrawn, the stem having\r\n    been apparently severed about three or four inches above the\r\n    uppermost knot. In the only instance I have seen in which the\r\n    attack was still in progress (that is, the stem was not already\r\n    parted, although it cracked asunder on being pulled), I found\r\n    that at the point of fracture the straw tube had within an\r\n    irregular swollen growth, what might be described as a\r\n    granulated growth, filling up the tube; also the cross-section\r\n    showed small open cells which had been cracked across in\r\n    severing the stem. I had specimens of the attack also on barley,\r\n    and at the time I was inclined, from the absence of all insect\r\n    appearance, to ascribe it to some vegetable disease, but in the\r\n    years that have elapsed since then it has appeared to me more\r\n    likely to be attributable to thrips.\r\n\r\n    I am afraid that there is not anything worth your study in the\r\n    page and a few lines of my remarks, but if you would care to see\r\n    it, I would gladly direct a copy of my twelfth Annual Report to\r\n    be sent for your acceptance. I would do so now, but I have not\r\n    an unbound copy by me. Many thanks for your own publications\r\n    which you have kindly sent me. I have read with great interest\r\n    your remarks on the _Argyresthia conjugella_, Zell.[82] We have\r\n    an apple attack here occasionally noticeable which agrees well\r\n    with the characteristics of this infestation, but I have never\r\n    been fortunate enough to identify the cause.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _To Professor Dr. Alfred Nalepa, Gmunden, Vienna._\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS, ENGLAND,\r\n                                                   _August 3, 1893_.\r\n\r\n    MONSIEUR,—I am very greatly indebted to your kindness and\r\n    courtesy in taking the trouble to give me all the very valuable\r\n    and helpful information which you favoured me with in your\r\n    letter of the 28th July. I also thank you much for your\r\n    permission to make some extracts in my Annual Report from the\r\n    information which you have placed in my hands. This is a very\r\n    great favour, and you may rest assured that I will most fully\r\n    acknowledge my debt to yourself. From the study of the pamphlet\r\n    which you were good enough to send me I have already benefited\r\n    largely. But I earnestly pray you, do not let me intrude on your\r\n    kind liberality for any work that I might be able (if you were\r\n    good enough to give me the name) to purchase. My London\r\n    booksellers are accustomed to procuring Continental publications\r\n    for me, and I am feeling myself so greatly indebted to you for\r\n    valuable information that I am quite uneasy at not being able to\r\n    reciprocate as I much wish. I have delayed writing in the hope\r\n    of being able to procure some specimens, but as yet I have only\r\n    the enclosed (Pear leaf blister galls, ? of _Phytoptus pyri_) to\r\n    send to you from trees in my own garden, and these I am afraid\r\n    will be of little interest. Your valuable list of infestations\r\n    has shown me that there are very many kinds of _Phytoptus_\r\n    attack that I had no idea of the existence of, and I will indeed\r\n    try to be of some service to you.\r\n\r\n    By book post accompanying I beg your kind acceptance of the\r\n    current number of my Annual Report, in which are some remarks on\r\n    a species of _Entedon_ (or _Entedonidæ_, parasites of Dipterous\r\n    leaf-miners especially) which we found in currant buds in\r\n    watching for what we hoped might prove a parasite on the\r\n    _Phytoptus_. I fear my report will be of little interest to you,\r\n    but I just beg you to accept to show the kind of publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 16, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I postponed replying to your kind letter of the 7th in the hope\r\n    that I might have something of interest to send you, but I have\r\n    only been able to procure the enclosed Prunus galls. They are\r\n    from Toddington, Gloucestershire. I rather fear they will wither\r\n    on the journey, but I forward them because the twigs have\r\n    something amiss with them, which just possibly may be owing to\r\n    _Phytoptus_ presence. Thank you much for giving me the name of\r\n    the _Phytoptus pyri_, which I have noted at p. 296 in your\r\n    “Katalog,” which you were good enough to send me, and which is\r\n    of truly valuable assistance. My booksellers will, I hope,\r\n    before long procure me five or six of your publications either\r\n    in separate impressions or in the parts or volumes in which they\r\n    were published, and then I shall hope to have the information\r\n    that I am much wishing for, without troubling you personally.\r\n    But should the special attack, which I desire to understand\r\n    better, not be specifically described, then I should indeed be\r\n    very thankful to avail myself of your kind permission to ask for\r\n    further information, and a sketch would be a most valuable aid.\r\n    I have too great a respect for the time and work of scientific\r\n    men to intrude if I can possibly help it, and I am very grateful\r\n    for the important help which you have already given me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, female (natural length circa 0·2 mm.); 2 _a_, left leg of the first\r\n    pair of _Phytoptus tristriatus_, and 2_b_, of _Phytoptus\r\n    tristriatus_ var. _carinea_, magnified 550 times—all after Dr.\r\n    Nalepa. 3, infested pear leaf.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 64.—PEAR LEAF BLISTER MITE, PHYTOPTUS PYRI.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _November 2, 1893._\r\n\r\n    I am greatly obliged for your kind letter received two days ago,\r\n    and it is so very good of you to have taken the trouble of\r\n    writing the names of the various portions of the _Phytoptus_ on\r\n    your plate accompanying so clearly for me that I hardly know how\r\n    to express my thanks sufficiently. This is indeed a most\r\n    acceptable help, for there were some of the quite minutely\r\n    technical terms that I had failed to make out the meaning of,\r\n    and now you have most excellently got over my difficulties for\r\n    me, and I thank you very much for the same. Since I wrote to you\r\n    at Gmünden I have had great pleasure and benefit in procuring\r\n    some of your valuable publications, so full of excellent\r\n    descriptions and figures. One of these is the separate\r\n    impression of your paper, read on January 24, 1889, with 9\r\n    plates, including p. 11, of which you have now sent me this\r\n    valuably explained copy.\r\n\r\n    Another—the separate impression for February 13th—contains\r\n    description, p. 11, and figure, plate iv., of _Phytoptus pyri_,\r\n    and I have also a copy of your “Genera und Species der Familie\r\n    Phytoptidæ,” 1891. Now I think, thanks to study of your clear\r\n    descriptions, I have a fair knowledge of the characteristics of\r\n    a _Phytoptus_, and of the divisions of the Family Phytoptidæ.\r\n    When I publish my next Annual Report I should very much wish to\r\n    give my readers some better information than I have hitherto\r\n    been able to do, and to point to them from what source I\r\n    obtained it, and how they may obtain it for themselves. I think\r\n    I have your kind permission to use one of your figures. I am\r\n    therefore having a very careful copy executed of your _P. pyri_\r\n    (plate IV., fig. 1), of the two claws (in your Genera and\r\n    Species, plate ii., 9_a_ and _b_), together with an attacked\r\n    leaf from life (fig. 64).\r\n\r\n    Your part would be a most soundly valuable aid to readers here,\r\n    for really and truly I doubt if more than very few among us are\r\n    aware (say) that the legs of the _Phytoptus_ are made up of\r\n    claw, tarsus, tibia, and so on, much less that the claw is of\r\n    this peculiar shape. I confess to you I was ignorant of this\r\n    myself. I should like to give a part of your description of the\r\n    _P. pyri_ to show what a description ought to be; also to allude\r\n    to the species which you were so good as to name for me, and to\r\n    your principle of classification (p. 317 of “Katalog”). Should\r\n    any of this not be according to your pleasure, I beg of you\r\n    kindly to tell me. I should indeed be ungrateful if, after all\r\n    your kind help, I trespassed on your information against your\r\n    wish. Should you allow it, you may depend on me to quote\r\n    accurately, so that my quotations will send readers to your\r\n    works, not enable them to use my report as a robbery of you;\r\n    also I would fully and honestly acknowledge the source of my\r\n    information, and be truly grateful. I wish I could send you\r\n    specimens. Would you care to have some galls of the _Phytoptus\r\n    ribis_ from black currant in their (I think) very unusually\r\n    advanced condition for this time of year? I think I could\r\n    procure some from Kent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Mite, greatly magnified—natural length of female 0·23\r\n    millimetres; 2, head and fore parts, still more magnified (by\r\n    permission, after Dr. A.

But if you could work less severely might not you\r\n    hope to have benefit? The excessively minute work of your\r\n    elaborate investigations must be exceedingly wearing. In my own\r\n    observations (which, indeed, are not to be compared with yours)\r\n    I always find they tell very much on my health if I have at once\r\n    to overwork my sight with the microscope and my mind in the\r\n    record of my observations. But I have not robust health, so that\r\n    I can sympathise. With renewed thanks for the welcome contents\r\n    of yours lately received.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 12, 1894._\r\n\r\n    I am greatly obliged to you for your kind present of your\r\n    “Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Phyllocoptiden,” with its first-rate\r\n    descriptions and magnificent figures. It is a very great\r\n    advantage to me to be in possession of your noble work on these\r\n    creatures, and I feel myself very much indebted for all the\r\n    great help you have given me.\r\n\r\n    About the _Phytoptus ribis_. I delayed replying because I\r\n    thought that if any thoroughly complete description of this\r\n    _Phytoptus_ had been published by Professor Westwood it would be\r\n    sure to be known of by Mr. W. Hatchett Jackson, of Keble\r\n    College, Oxford, who was Professor Westwood’s chief assistant.\r\n    But he tells me that “under the generic name of _Acarellus_ I\r\n    can find nothing but a brief paragraph without figure in the\r\n    accounts of the meetings of the Entom. Soc.” Mr. Jackson adds,\r\n    “I remember the occasion very well, and making slides for him\r\n    from specimens in our own garden. I shall search for those\r\n    slides in the Hope Museum.”—W. H. J.\r\n\r\n    After some search here I found the enclosed, and as I think you\r\n    would desire to see the fullest account which I believe\r\n    Professor Westwood published, I have detached the page. If he\r\n    were still with us I know how he would have delighted in your\r\n    splendid unravelling of what was then a mystery. At your best\r\n    convenience, when you have quite certainly no further use for\r\n    the page, perhaps you would kindly let me have it back.\r\n\r\n    In my own early observations of the habits of the Currant\r\n    _Phytoptus_ I noted it as _P. ribis_, Westwood, on the\r\n    authority, or rather after the example, of Mr. Andrew Murray\r\n    (see “Aptera,” p. 355), for we had not in those days any more\r\n    trustworthy and accepted guidance, but as to comparing these\r\n    with such a work as yours, no one with the least atom of\r\n    knowledge would think for a minute of such a thing.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To C. P. Lounsbury, Esq., Government Entomologist, Cape Town._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                               _September 17, 1895_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. LOUNSBURY,—It gave me great pleasure to receive your\r\n    letter this morning, in all excepting that I find I might\r\n    possibly have seen yourself and Mrs. Lounsbury. I am really very\r\n    sorry not to have done this, for there are many things so\r\n    difficult to enter on in writing, which yet (as now you are on\r\n    our British staff) I should like you to know, relative to\r\n    entomological matters, and also, though I should have said this\r\n    first, it would have been a pleasure to my sister and myself to\r\n    become personally acquainted with you. How fortunate you are in\r\n    having such a skilled colleague [his wife]; it must be a real\r\n    comfort to you to have an entomological _alter ego_, and yet\r\n    such a charming companion.\r\n\r\n    You will have made acquaintance with your colleagues, and you\r\n    will, I conjecture, find Mr. Bairstow useful if he be still\r\n    attending to insect matters. He collected a great deal of\r\n    information for me when I was compiling my little S.A. book. But\r\n    now I am chiefly writing to indicate the pleasure it will give\r\n    me to be in communication with you as occasion may occur, and\r\n    with good wishes both for your success and comfort to yourself\r\n    and Mrs. Lounsbury, &c.\r\n\r\n    I do not know whether you have my little book on “South African\r\n    Insects,” so I beg your acceptance of a copy sent by this post.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Beetle; 2, larva; 3, pupa, magnified (from Bulletin No. 4, New\r\n    Series, U.S.A.

The English\r\n    manufacturers did what is so very inconvenient—though one is\r\n    not surprised at it—they begged that their names and\r\n    localities might not be mentioned. But with regard to the\r\n    use of a deterrent paste (or mixture in the paste), it was\r\n    quite plain that they did not mean to do anything. They\r\n    spoke of difficulties to the workers, &c., and as to using\r\n    Paris-green!—really, there would have been a disturbance\r\n    indeed, if I had ventured to suggest such a thing. The\r\n    subject appeared to be making no headway, and my suggestions\r\n    as to the all-importance of cleanliness in the workshop, so\r\n    that the beetles might have no harbouring places, did not\r\n    meet their views. So I strongly advised in order to make\r\n    sure whether the infestation took possession in this country\r\n    or at the Cape, that some boots should be packed up and\r\n    properly secured against all possibilities of external\r\n    infestation, and sent to South Africa, and on arrival there,\r\n    sent back to the exporters here unopened. Thus we should\r\n    have learned on examination, if they were infested, that the\r\n    mischief was started in this country. But not one word on\r\n    the subject have I had from them since. Perhaps the result\r\n    put the locality of the origin of evil being in this country\r\n    beyond doubt. I have kept a quantity of the letters on the\r\n    subject laid away, but now I think I cannot use them to\r\n    better purpose than by forwarding them to you. Please do not\r\n    return them. I have not re-read them, but it is impossible\r\n    there can be anything confidential in them, excepting the\r\n    names of the firms which the writers did not wish published,\r\n    and it is just possible (in case you can spare time to run\r\n    them through) that there may be points of interest.\r\n\r\n    What you say of inertness is just what is such a drag on the\r\n    advance of work here. Instead of getting information, and acting\r\n    on it, they (or many) propose to write to the Board of\r\n    Agriculture or possibly to another quarter, and sometimes they\r\n    follow advice, sometimes they do not.\r\n\r\n    Just now I had an application about _Strongylus filaria_ (thread\r\n    worms which produce husk or hoose) which is doing great damage\r\n    in one district. They thought of writing to the Board of\r\n    Agriculture. I suggested the excellent account in your Dr.\r\n    Curtice’s book on “Sheep Diseases,” but it did not appear to\r\n    have occurred to them to teach themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _June 24, 1896._\r\n\r\n    It was with great pleasure that I received your first Report\r\n    about two days ago, and I must both very sincerely and heartily\r\n    congratulate you on this good work. It seems to me quite an\r\n    example of what a report should be. Clear wording that all can\r\n    understand, and a short sound life history, with all requisite\r\n    means of prevention of the specially detailed “pest” attacks,\r\n    with a deal of excellent reading besides. Indeed, I congratulate\r\n    you greatly on taking your place so firmly, and I consider the\r\n    Colony is much to be congratulated also on securing your help. I\r\n    am glad to see that the Government gives you good paper and\r\n    printing. There is only one thing which I should much like to\r\n    see added, and that is pictorial illustrations. Could not you\r\n    have at least some figures? I believe they are available in the\r\n    Government Stores. Sometime after the publication of my little\r\n    book on the “Injurious Insects of South Africa,” a request was\r\n    made to me for a number of figures, which with much pleasure I\r\n    presented. If you would like, besides those which could be\r\n    looked up at the office of the “Agricultural Journal,” electros\r\n    of some of the figures which are my own, which I use in my own\r\n    publications, I would gladly send you out, say a dozen or a\r\n    dozen and a half, if the Agent General would (as I feel pretty\r\n    sure he would) kindly allow me to send them out to you in the\r\n    Government box. It would give me real pleasure if I could be of\r\n    any help to you in your good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 17, 1896._\r\n\r\n    I have this morning had great pleasure in receiving your letter,\r\n    and I shall be very glad to send you electrotypes of the blocks\r\n    of which you will let me have a list,—that is to say, of such as\r\n    are quite my own. Those that I have from Messrs. Blackie and\r\n    Son, Stanhope Street, Glasgow, I have only permission to use in\r\n    my own publications. I think very likely, though, that, if you\r\n    were inclined to purchase electrotypes from them, they would be\r\n    quite willing to let you have them at the same price which they\r\n    charge me, that is eighteenpence the square inch. About my own,\r\n    I have no difficulties, as my wood figures and electrotypes are\r\n    all in charge of my printers. There would be no charge for\r\n    carriage, and I would charge you just the cost price of the\r\n    electros. But there is one point, please, that I am sure you\r\n    will forgive me insisting on as a condition of use of my\r\n    electrotypes, namely, that they may be used in any publication\r\n    of the Department of Agriculture of Cape Colony, or in any\r\n    publication of your own, but nowhere else without my consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 28, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I have, I am afraid, been owing you for a long time, more than\r\n    one letter in reciprocation of your kind letters to me, but I\r\n    have hoped you would forgive me, for you know how I am situated\r\n    with a deal of application and no staff. I am wanting now to say\r\n    that I hope you have not been vexed with me for having had a\r\n    hand in robbing you of an efficient member of your staff (Mr.\r\n    Fuller), which I am afraid must for the present be an\r\n    inconvenience, but it surely will be an immense benefit to\r\n    Natal, to have a trustworthy Entomologist.\r\n\r\n    I am trying to work up _Piophila casei_ (Cheese and Bacon fly),\r\n    which Miss Murtfeldt took up so well. I incline to think that it\r\n    is more present than is supposed, only of course, “cured meat”\r\n    dealers do not like to own to it. I have got a nice little\r\n    family reared from bacon for observation under a glass, and some\r\n    of their brothers and sisters loose about the room, which I see\r\n    little or nothing of until the cheese is brought in twice a day,\r\n    when they come, and so give me an opportunity of watching\r\n    egg-laying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 9, 1899._\r\n\r\n    What a frightful thing this prospect of war is! I have not an\r\n    idea what may be politically right, but it distresses me\r\n    intensely to think of the sorrow, and so far as in me lay I have\r\n    had a hand in getting poor Mr. Fuller right into the thick of\r\n    the trouble.[83] You have assuredly been having trouble enough,\r\n    with fire, water, and “sausages”! I am truly glad that your\r\n    books and insects were not very much damaged. But I hope you\r\n    will not peril your valuable health by turning yourself into a\r\n    pasturage ground as you say, for these very detestable ticks.\r\n    Much better try the convict! His nervous system will not be so\r\n    delicate.[84]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _July 5, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I learn with great pleasure that you and Mrs. Lounsbury are\r\n    coming back through England, and I hope you will be able to give\r\n    me the great pleasure of your looking in here. I should be so\r\n    glad to see you, and you and I could have some delightful\r\n    entomological talk. On Saturday next, I hope to see Dr. John B.\r\n    Smith, State Entomologist of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n    What a business you must have in transporting your parasites\r\n    from America to Cape Colony, but I hope you will have good\r\n    success in obtaining the specimens you are needing.\r\n\r\n                                                    Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To Claude Fuller, Esq., Entomologist Department of Agriculture,\r\n                       Pietermaritzburg, Natal._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                                 _November 5, 1898_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. FULLER,—I would very gladly in reply to your request,\r\n    offer you any suggestion in my power, but I scarcely know\r\n    whether my ideas would be serviceable. Judging by my own\r\n    experiences in purchase by farmers or fruit-growers of books\r\n    which they certainly need and wish to have the information\r\n    contained in, I should not expect any publisher to take any MS.\r\n    of mine as a speculation. The good folks wish for the books, but\r\n    they do not, at least only a very small proportion of them (I am\r\n    speaking of agriculturists) wish to buy. My work is done at a\r\n    great money loss, and my publishers do not take my books as a\r\n    speculation, but act in fact as my agents. Could you not get\r\n    your MS. published in a serial, with a stipulation, that you\r\n    held copyright, and so your valuable information would be\r\n    brought forward without cost to yourself.\r\n\r\n    There is another point. The differences in species, even in\r\n    genera, are terribly difficult to be sure of amongst many of the\r\n    Scale insects, and many of the Aphides, and unless fruit-growers\r\n    have magnifiers and knowledge how to use them, I should not\r\n    expect them to identify to any trustworthy purpose. If you\r\n    brought out a strictly scientific work this of course would be\r\n    very valuable as a book of reference, and Prevention and\r\n    Remedies added would make it very useful indeed; but if you look\r\n    forward to purchase by the public, I am afraid you will not find\r\n    it happen.\r\n\r\n    Please excuse rather a hurried letter to catch the evening post,\r\n    and believe me,\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                   LETTERS TO MR.

JANSON, addressed in the opening letters of this chapter, occupied\r\nthe position of technical expert, to whom Miss Ormerod referred her\r\ngenerally accurate identifications of insects for confirmation. The\r\ncases of flour infestation referred to we have learned of in Chapter X.,\r\n“Legal Experiences.” The language employed is more technical than in any\r\nother part of her correspondence—the words of an expert addressing\r\nherself to another expert in the language of their common subject. Mr.\r\nMedd’s name has been more associated with education than entomology,\r\nespecially in relation to the comparatively new branch of “Nature\r\nStudy.”\r\n\r\n_To Mr. O. E. Janson, Technical Expert in Entomology, 44, Great Russell\r\nStreet, W.C._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBAN’S,\r\n                                                _February 13, 1897._\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. JANSON,—I hope that in a very few days you will receive\r\n    your copy of my twentieth Report, in which you helped me so\r\n    especially about the Forest flies.\r\n\r\n    I am hoping you may be good enough to help me about the\r\n    enclosed, or kindly put me in the right path, for I greatly hope\r\n    that this may prove to be the long-needed observation about\r\n    amount of wings of the ♀(female) Deer Forest fly, the _Lipoptera\r\n    cervi_ (fig. 23). I received a day or two ago a good number,\r\n    many still alive, or fresh on a little piece of Roe-deer’s hide,\r\n    which was infested with them even to being in clusters (from\r\n    Strathconan forest, Ross-shire). On examining, I found on each\r\n    side, at the hinder edge of the thorax, a little membranous kind\r\n    of structure with a scalloped edge, and on very carefully\r\n    raising it I found it was fixed to the thorax by a joint, and\r\n    was, I think, quite certainly an abortive wing. I saw veins\r\n    traversing the structure longitudinally, and though the\r\n    scalloped and notched extremity was irregular in shape, it did\r\n    not at all have the appearance (to my thinking at least) of\r\n    being torn. Enclosed I send you half a dozen specimens, one of\r\n    which has the structure very plain; the others I picked out at\r\n    random, and what I am very much wishing you would help me about\r\n    is whether these are females. They have the distinguishing dark\r\n    brown colour (not the faint yellow colour of the male), and I\r\n    should say they had the shape of the female, but I am not\r\n    anatomist enough to be certain. If you cannot with complete\r\n    convenience tell me yourself could you oblige by getting me a\r\n    trustworthy opinion. I would most gladly give a most liberal\r\n    consideration to any one you would get to investigate, for if\r\n    these are females, we have here the long-wanted observation, and\r\n    proof that they have abortive wings. I have plenty more\r\n    specimens if you would care for some more; also I have two\r\n    puparia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 23, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I am greatly obliged to you for helping me in this matter of the\r\n    _L. cervi_. You will remember that you kindly helped me to a\r\n    sight of a good number of German publications, from which I made\r\n    large extracts, and, turning to these, I find notes of the male\r\n    and of the female _L. cervi_, being found together in the hair\r\n    of the deer all the winter through, and pairing there and the\r\n    female depositing puparia. But the matter is much involved by\r\n    the following statement regarding two varieties in the form of\r\n    the males by Professor Stein, or Hartmann quoted by Stein: “The\r\n    first are pale yellow, and the abdomen is slender and shrivels\r\n    considerably after death; the latter are more yellow brown,\r\n    their abdomen is wider and firmer, and the external organs of\r\n    propagation clearly observable.” There is a deal about abortive\r\n    or shed wings, but the writers are under uncertainty. My belief\r\n    is that our only hope towards clearing up the matter is our own\r\n    observation, and if these creatures are really females, we have\r\n    got the information that was being sought after. But do not let\r\n    me tax your very great good nature too much. If you could give a\r\n    specimen or two to Mr. Verrall and to Mr. Austen I should like\r\n    it, and you would hear what they say, and I would replace them\r\n    to you. I have two puparia which I suppose are not likely to\r\n    develop till towards the end of summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 16, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I have been so fortunate as to find a puparium of a Deer Forest\r\n    fly lately sent me in a consignment from Strathconan, and this\r\n    gave me an opportunity of communicating with Professor Jos. Mik,\r\n    Vienna, and he pronounces the specimens I sent accompanying to\r\n    be females. He writes me (and I think it very kind of him to\r\n    take the trouble) an exceedingly long letter, full of\r\n    information and references, extending in a very small\r\n    handwriting over five and a half large pages of note-paper, and,\r\n    as he justly remarks, I have some difficulty in reading it!\r\n\r\n    I think of getting Mr. Pillischer to make some preparations of\r\n    the _L. cervi_ ♀and their abortive wings so that we may have\r\n    material for a good figure. Professor Mik is fearfully\r\n    particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 12, 1897._\r\n\r\n    Professor Mik identified my _L. cervi_ as certainly\r\n    well-developed females. I think he was a good deal pleased to\r\n    have a mature puparium which I sent him and to dissect out an\r\n    immature one. He says that he has himself ♀ of _L. cervi_, with\r\n    abortive wings, so my work will not be a discovery as I hoped,\r\n    still I think it will be of interest to illustrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 24, 1897._\r\n\r\n    Your description of _L. minor_ (lesser earwig) has helped me\r\n    enormously, and I have translated as much as I think is likely\r\n    to be needed of the technical part to help Mr. Knight to make a\r\n    characteristic drawing (fig. 43).\r\n\r\n    I should like ♂ or ♀and forceps of both, and I have material for\r\n    this, but I should very much like a wing. I tried to unfold one\r\n    or two and wasted my materials. Would your microscopist set one\r\n    for me do you think? I should much like it; for I fancy (I have\r\n    not been able to make sure) that there is a longer band of dark\r\n    colour along the front edge than in our common earwig. But, any\r\n    way, if I could have the wing set I should very much like to\r\n    have a good figure of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _October 5, 1897._\r\n\r\n    If you can spare time to help me in the present inquiry, I\r\n    should be much obliged; it is quite a trade business matter. I\r\n    am consulted by a London firm dealing in flour, as to\r\n    infestation in their barrels, but as I gather it may be both\r\n    from the Eastern and the Western world, and also may be infested\r\n    by insect pests from whatever may be lying on the wharves, I\r\n    want to be very sure of my identifications.\r\n\r\n    The presence of _Ephestia kuhniella_ (Flour moth) was quite\r\n    plain, so this I need not trouble you about. But about the\r\n    “Weevils.” I think those of which I enclose specimens in the\r\n    bottle stoppered with cotton wool, are the common _Calandra_ (=\r\n    _Sitophilus granarius_). I am quite sure _C. oryzæ_ was present,\r\n    but I do not think I have enclosed any. Messrs. Henderson write\r\n    me to-day that they are quite sure their barrels took the\r\n    infestation from oil-cakes which were swarming with _S.\r\n    granarius_. To the best of my belief and search, _Calandra_ only\r\n    lives on grain, so I fancy that its connection with the\r\n    oil-cakes must be only as a shelter. I know _Calandra_ will\r\n    resort to remains of bread and milk or ripe apricots near a\r\n    granary, but I supposed this was in search of moisture. But,\r\n    nevertheless, as one weevil is so like another, it would be an\r\n    important help if you would kindly verify my identification for\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    In the same little bottle are two small not-far-from-globose\r\n    pubescent beetles, which I thought might be _Niptus hololeucus_,\r\n    but when they came clean I saw they had not the beautiful bright\r\n    yellow pubescence, nor were they so globose. I do not know them;\r\n    you probably will at a glance, and your kind help would save me\r\n    long search. Amongst the larvæ I found one answering to that of\r\n    _Cucujus testaceus_ (as given in Curtis) = _Læmophlœus\r\n    ferrugineus_—and in the flour there were numbers of the minute\r\n    rusty little beetles of which I enclose some in a corked bottle.\r\n    Will these be _Cucujus ferrugineus_? I do not think I have any\r\n    types, and as this is such a decided business inquiry, I feel\r\n    sure you will allow me to ask you to keep me right about it, at\r\n    your convenience. The flour or barrels or something must have\r\n    been (to my thinking) in a very neglected state.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  6, 7, Granary weevil; 2, 3, chrysalis, natural size, and magnified; 8,\r\n    9, rice weevil, natural size, and magnified; 1, 4, infested grains,\r\n    also magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68.—GRANARY WEEVIL, _SITOPHILUS GRANARIUS_, AND RICE WEEVIL,\r\n    _SITOPHILUS ORYZÆ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 11, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I am greatly obliged to you for your kind help about the flour\r\n    coleoptera. I was puzzled about the _granarius_, as there was a\r\n    slightly different look about it, from the specimens which I\r\n    usually have, and I had no series for comparison. I have never\r\n    had _Læmophlœus_ in this quantity before,—they run in all\r\n    directions out of the flour. I cannot find another _Ptinus_, but\r\n    the information you have given me is quite enough, I am sure,\r\n    for my flour people. The really important attack that they have\r\n    got is _E. kuhniella_ (Flour moth) but as the flour is in\r\n    barrels perhaps it will not trouble them.\r\n\r\n    I have kept my _X. saxeseni_ (Shot-borer beetles), in a\r\n    good-sized glass-topped box, where the larvæ are still throwing\r\n    out dust and the beetles come out and die, but I do not see any\r\n    more, and I think that instead of giving you more trouble about\r\n    them I had better get Mr. Knight to copy one of the U.S.A.\r\n    imagos and add larvæ, pupæ, and strange “cleft” like cell from\r\n    life. If the specimens you have are of interest to you pray\r\n    oblige me by keeping them. I think I have material for a really\r\n    interesting paper. Do you happen to know what has become of my\r\n    very much valued correspondent, Dr. Karl Lindeman [the Russian\r\n    Entomologist]? I have not heard from him for a year and a half,\r\n    and I do not find his name in the U.S.A. Scientists’ Guide. He\r\n    was truly friendly and very punctilious in writing, but if he\r\n    were dead I think I should have seen his obituary. I wonder\r\n    whether he was so useful to the people that he has had to take a\r\n    trip to Siberia!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 26, 1897._\r\n\r\n    What work _Hylurgus piniperda_ (Pine beetle),[85] continues to\r\n    make in some of the great Pine woods in Scotland, consequent on\r\n    the damage by high winds some years ago. I had an application a\r\n    little while ago from the forester on one of the great\r\n    properties near Aberdeen, who reports great mischief on 1,000\r\n    acres. This afternoon I have a report of the woods at Craighlaw,\r\n    Kirkcowan, Wigtonshire, being in most dismal condition.\r\n\r\n    I really wonder whether it will ever occur to our Board of\r\n    Agriculture that there ought to be a Government Entomologist. It\r\n    is only a short time since I had an application connected with\r\n    the Austrian Embassy about a beetle attack that was eating the\r\n    oats at Constantinople, but I suggested that Vienna was\r\n    unsurpassed for its scientific men!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 18, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I am thinking (though I have not mentioned the matter beyond\r\n    just beginning at present) of (if I can find it) taking a\r\n    comfortable villa and good garden at or in the outskirts of\r\n    Brighton. I much wish to be nearer relations, for living so much\r\n    alone is at times a very dreary kind of thing. Also there are\r\n    many points in which Brighton would, I think, suit me better for\r\n    my work, and possibly be more conveniently easy of access for\r\n    entomological friends living on the South London lines. I know\r\n    the place very well, and it has always suited my health\r\n    excellently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 19, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I have a _Hippoboscid_ this afternoon from Mr. Wheler, which was\r\n    found on a lamb. He thinks it is a Grouse fly (or Spider fly, a\r\n    near relative of the Forest fly). Surely oddly located! But so\r\n    far as I see I think it must be so. Shall I not send it you? In\r\n    any case it might be of interest, and I should very much like,\r\n    at your convenience, to be made sure of what it is. If it be\r\n    _Ornithomyia avicularia_ (Grouse fly), I conjecture that it\r\n    straggled into the nearest shelter when it developed. It is in\r\n    beautiful order, but so lively that I have not been able to get\r\n    a good look at the claws. [This identification was confirmed by\r\n    Mr. Janson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 22, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I am much obliged to you for all the points of interesting\r\n    information in your letter. There is no hurry about figuring the\r\n    Grouse fly, so that if Mr. Norman would kindly let me have the\r\n    slide as soon as he thinks it would be safe to use it, I should\r\n    feel very much obliged. I now enclose the specimen from a lamb.\r\n    I quieted its very superabundant antics by slipping a little\r\n    lump of cotton wool down the tube, about a third of the way, and\r\n    it accepted the soft material moderately. It died afterwards,\r\n    and I enclose it with some spirits in the tube. I should (if not\r\n    inconvenient to you to ask), very much like this specimen also\r\n    set by Mr. Norman, with the wings as they are at present—at\r\n    rest, but showing the fore-nerves very nicely. I incline to\r\n    think that if this be certainly _O. avicularia_, that it would\r\n    suit better for figuring than the previous specimen as being in\r\n    the same position as my _H. equina_ and _L. cervi_, both ♂ and\r\n    ♀in previous Annual Reports. If you could oblige me with the two\r\n    slides together I could make what personal observations I want;\r\n    have which ever seems best figured, and afterwards, if one or\r\n    both are of interest to you, I would very gladly beg your\r\n    acceptance. I daresay you will be good enough to let me use your\r\n    interesting short note about finding the specimen of\r\n    _avicularia_ alive in the box with the Horned owl.\r\n\r\n    I am working now on _Piophila casei_, Linn. (Cheese and Bacon\r\n    fly, fig. 12), and hope to make a good paper, with some original\r\n    observations of my own. Is it not a noteworthy circumstance that\r\n    besides undoubtedly breeding in myriads in stores of cheese and\r\n    bacon, that also they come in through the windows in such\r\n    numbers that wire gauze, or equivalent, is a recognised\r\n    protective measure? I think this points to there being some home\r\n    of _P. casei_ that wants looking up.\r\n\r\n    I did think Brighton might suit me better, but I found there was\r\n    no suitable house, so I am staying here. I am very glad that you\r\n    had a pleasant rest, and a beneficial one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Grouse fly, magnified, with line showing natural length; 2,\r\n    puparium, magnified and natural size; 3, end view, magnified; 4,\r\n    claw, magnified.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.—GROUSE FLY, _ORNITHOMYIA AVICULARIA_, LINN.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 21, 1899._\r\n\r\n    Messrs. Forshaw and Hawkins, of Liverpool, have written me\r\n    regarding beetle and maggot presence in flour and meal in two\r\n    compartments of “Telesford,” from New Orleans to Glasgow. They\r\n    send me “a deal of”[86] report and two tubes with beetles, larvæ\r\n    and flour. I believe these beetles (and larvæ) to be _Tribolium\r\n    ferrugineum_ (Rust-red flour beetle), and I enclose four beetles\r\n    and six maggots. Will you be so very good as to let me know if I\r\n    am right, and I enclose a telegraph form filled in, which would\r\n    put me at ease for the present if you would be good enough to\r\n    send it to me. The reason I am troubling you now is that the\r\n    small amount of flour in the little tubes has the characteristic\r\n    (mentioned in Mr. Chittenden’s paper in “Household Insects,”\r\n    &c., in a Bulletin of U.S.A.) of being greyish. See top of p.\r\n    113 as to “Flour Beetles.”\r\n\r\n    This is quite different from the state of Messrs. Smyth and\r\n    Co.’s flour, and if you are so good as to confirm my\r\n    identification I might perhaps be allowed to use the information\r\n    on our side on Tuesday, when Mr. Blyth comes down about\r\n    depositions. The Glasgow case has every appearance of being on\r\n    the road to a lawsuit, but now (after Friday’s experience) I\r\n    should not be so afraid of giving evidence, if you would make me\r\n    sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Beetle; 2, larva; 3, pupa—magnified, and with lines showing natural\r\n    length; 4, head with antennæ, much magnified.\r\n\r\n   FIG. 70.—RUST-RED FLOUR BEETLE, _TRIBOLIUM FERRUGINEUM_, FAB.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _November 1, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I received the Grouse fly slide in perfect safety, beautifully\r\n    put up; many thanks to you for procuring the same.

MEDD,—I am much obliged by the packet of publications\r\n    regarding the work of the “Agricultural Education\r\n    Committee,”[88] and I note excellent names in your list of\r\n    members, and some excellently true observations in your\r\n    four-page leaflet, “Agricultural Instruction in the Elementary\r\n    School.” But it is with great difficulty that I am able to keep\r\n    my own work in hand, and I have been quite unable to find time\r\n    to study the other pamphlets which you have been good enough to\r\n    send me, although, from their titles, I make no doubt that they\r\n    contain both valuable information and suggestion.\r\n\r\n    Although I am sure that plain and interesting information on\r\n    subjects of their daily surroundings would be gladly received by\r\n    the boys, I do not in the least see my way to complying with\r\n    your flattering suggestion of my pen being useful in the matter.\r\n    You know how I am situated? There is a constant stream of\r\n    applications sent me for advice regarding prevention of insect\r\n    pests, which though chiefly about British troubles, involves\r\n    much correspondence both with the Entomologists of our Colonies,\r\n    the Continent and the U.S.A.—and to meet which I have no staff.\r\n    I could not find time to write papers such as you desire; but if\r\n    you wish I would send you copies of such leaflets as I have in\r\n    which some of the ordinary crop pests are treated of very\r\n    plainly; and from these I make no doubt that you could get\r\n    passages arranged for your readers which the boys would like to\r\n    read.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _July 9, 1900._\r\n\r\n    It gratifies me very much that you should think my leaflets and\r\n    “Manual” likely to be of use; and you have only to express the\r\n    wish, for me to send another hundred of the “Manuals” as soon as\r\n    they could be bound. I have been reading and much appreciating\r\n    your observations in “Our Programme,”[89] of which you have\r\n    kindly given me a copy, and it has occurred to me whether, now\r\n    that I understand the scope of your work better, I might arrange\r\n    a very simple paper on our commonest Live Stock attacks. I\r\n    enclose a few pages as a sample of what is in my mind, just\r\n    giving what could be taken in (and I think is needed) with\r\n    addition of a little more life history, and the exceedingly\r\n    simple methods of prevention. I have quantities of first-rate\r\n    illustrations, but now I just submit the enclosed to you, hoping\r\n    you will be kind enough to let me know at your convenience what\r\n    you think of my idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 14, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am personally truly grateful for your letter of this morning,\r\n    for I was very uneasy lest I should be, to put it shortly,\r\n    giving sad offence. I certainly think the “Water-baby”[90]\r\n    leaflet is a great mistake, but, as you judiciously remark, if\r\n    it is to be issued we must make the best of it.\r\n\r\n    I will think over to the best of my power what appears likely to\r\n    be of use agriculturally on the subject of fly attacks on farm\r\n    stock. Whilst I am preparing the papers themselves perhaps a\r\n    good heading such as I may presently submit for approval will\r\n    suggest itself. I should much like to have the primary heading\r\n    “Agricultural Education Committee,” for—with a footnote that the\r\n    papers were prepared at the desire of the Agricultural Education\r\n    Committee to give information—this would throw a shield over me,\r\n    in writing on Cattle and Stock attacks. The ones selected do not\r\n    infringe on what might be called “Veterinary”—things that\r\n    involve discussion unbecoming in a lady writer, and those I\r\n    propose to write on are what I have long had application about.\r\n    There need be no difficulty about publishing if I do it in my\r\n    usual way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 2, 1900._\r\n\r\n    After your visit, so pleasant as well as profitable to myself\r\n    yesterday, I sat down as soon as I could to see what I could\r\n    write about “Wasps,” and I enclose the results. It is mostly an\r\n    abstract of records of much personal observation of my own. If\r\n    you like I would gladly lend electros of the figures.[91] If you\r\n    care to accept the enclosed for any use to our Agricultural\r\n    Education Committee that you may think it may be suited, I\r\n    should be really pleased, only begging that it may not on any\r\n    account whatever appear as part of the “Water-baby” series—that\r\n    really I do not think I could bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _August 8, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I thank you very heartily for your courteous reception of my\r\n    letter about resignation. It is very good of you to write so\r\n    kindly on the subject. I enclose you a copy of the letter which\r\n    I have sent to the Secretary, which I have endeavoured to\r\n    express with the friendliness which I feel. But, much as I\r\n    regret leaving, I find that, independently of the considerations\r\n    which I told to you, when I come to the real working my health\r\n    does not allow it. If I am over-pressed it brings on (without\r\n    being unduly explicit) troubles both of health and sight, and I\r\n    am very thankful that, beyond your exceedingly kind expressions,\r\n    you do not press my remaining too hardly on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 26, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Many thanks to you for Mr. Bathurst’s paper on “Orchards;”[92]\r\n    there is some excellent advice in it, particularly about sawing\r\n    beneath the limb, trimming smooth, and not planting deep. But I\r\n    think that as the piece of cloth to be tied round the tree is to\r\n    “act as a trap,” a little addition is needed (see my “Insects\r\n    Injurious to Orchard and Bush Fruit,” pp. 12, 13), viz., that\r\n    the trap should be examined and the caterpillars cleared out\r\n    every few days, or say every fortnight. If this be not done the\r\n    sacking is very likely to make a nice little house for them.\r\n    Please excuse my giving my views thus vigorously, and uncalled\r\n    for.\r\n\r\n                                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n            LETTERS TO PROFESSOR ROBERT WALLACE BEFORE 1900\r\n\r\nWashing Wheat—Text-book on Insects—Grease-banding Trees—Steven Lecturer\r\n    on Agricultural Entomology—Australian agriculture—Examiner in\r\n    Agricultural Entomology—Insect cases presented to the\r\n    University—Death of Miss G.

They deal more with University and personal matters, and with\r\nefforts being made to advance the cause of Economic Entomology than with\r\nthe structural details and habits of insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _To Professor Robert Wallace, University of Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                                  _August 20, 1888_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—I have delayed for a short time thanking\r\n    you for your very kind present of your beautiful as well as\r\n    valuable book on “Indian Agriculture,”[93] as I wished to make a\r\n    little acquaintance with it before writing. Now I see what a\r\n    great amount of serviceable information you have collected, and\r\n    I am greatly obliged for such an addition to my library. I note\r\n    what you wisely say about not substituting our implements\r\n    hastily for native kinds better fitted to the land, but just now\r\n    your explicit account of “wheat cleaning,” beginning at p. 227,\r\n    interests me exceedingly. I should be so glad if, when you have\r\n    leisure, you would tell me a little more about this. You mention\r\n    Messrs. Dell and Son, of London, as the firm that specially gave\r\n    you information. I have been in communication about cleaning\r\n    wheat with some of the Hull millers, one of the large corn\r\n    brokers in Liverpool, and some other places, and had not heard\r\n    of the washing, and this point, to me at least, seems a very\r\n    important one. When I have gone carefully into the subject, and\r\n    had the different kinds of screening sent in bags they do not\r\n    seem to me to have been wetted. If they can wash at one mill\r\n    they can at another, and we might have a chance of getting these\r\n    pest-bearing extras neutralised as to evil qualities. I should\r\n    greatly like to show you my set of screenings from Hull,\r\n    labelled with their uses.\r\n\r\n    Do you happen to be aware of its being a regular business to\r\n    supply weed seed, &c., &c., to deteriorate imports—that is of\r\n    course exports of Russia, &c.? I had an interview with one of a\r\n    firm who used to take orders for this at Samara! I believe these\r\n    foul screenings most likely brought Hessian fly, and I rather\r\n    think from a larva I saw in the spring _Meromyza_ is come too.\r\n\r\n    It appears to me a deplorable thing that everything should be so\r\n    absolutely arranged to import these nasty pests amongst us. If\r\n    you will come I will show you my “pièces démonstratives.” I have\r\n    not a book like yours to reciprocate your kind thought, but will\r\n    you give the enclosed “Manual of Injurious Insects” a place in\r\n    your collection. With kind remembrances from my sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 12, 1889._\r\n\r\n    About a text-book on Injurious Insects—it is not well to\r\n    recommend one’s own work, but I most earnestly wish that I knew\r\n    of any better English book for plain work than my own “Manual.”\r\n    I formed it because there was no other book that met the\r\n    everyday needs of Agricultural Entomology, excepting my own\r\n    Annual Reports, and the Reports of the Department of\r\n    Agriculture, which are formed in great part from my work and\r\n    revised by myself. I do not know of any work on Agricultural\r\n    Entomology which I can recommend.\r\n\r\n    If you want something very good about the lower creatures up to\r\n    date I suppose you could not mend “Text Book of Zoology,” by Dr.\r\n    Claus, translated by Adam Sedgwick. This is a grand book, but I\r\n    would not put it in my students’ hands without a strong\r\n    observation that I consider Darwinianism, &c., of this nature\r\n    perfectly unproved and baseless. I certainly think that\r\n    presently this view will follow “spontaneous generation.”[94]\r\n    But to go on, Curtis’ “Farm Insects” is an excellent book up to\r\n    date of publication, but that is long ago now, and the second\r\n    edition is an issue of the original sheets with a new\r\n    preface—also £1 1s. is a great deal for students to give. If you\r\n    want a book for your own study, “Die Praktische Insektenkunde,”\r\n    by Dr. Taschenberg is to my thinking unrivalled for practice and\r\n    science—price circa £1 4s.\r\n\r\n    Now about your Australian larvæ. The longer and larger is a\r\n    lepidopterous caterpillar; as far as I see nearly allied to\r\n    our Turnip caterpillar, that is to say, of much the same\r\n    nature as what we call Surface caterpillar here, and Cutworms\r\n    in America. This would probably turn to a good-sized moth. The\r\n    larvæ in the two other bottles appear to me to be beetle\r\n    grubs, of the _Lamellicornes_—you will notice the three pairs\r\n    of well-developed legs, and the peculiar swollen form of the\r\n    caudal extremity. I should suppose that like our Cockchafer\r\n    (figs. 58) (or some other Chafer) maggots, that they fed at\r\n    the roots of grass or other plants, but I should not like to\r\n    commit myself to giving even a generic name to exotic pests in\r\n    larval state. Would not a letter to Mr. Frazer Crawford,\r\n    Adelaide, be the best way to gain information about\r\n    prevention? And about figuring, if you sent specimens to\r\n    Messrs. West, Newman & Co., 54, Hatton Garden, London, E.C.,\r\n    they would get them well figured—but still as the grubs and\r\n    caterpillar have been so long in spirit the exact shape could\r\n    not be conveyed.\r\n\r\n    I am delighted to hear that you are making progress about\r\n    attention to insect pests in your University. When Professor\r\n    Harker[95] was here lately, he told us something about these\r\n    matters, and I cordially wished him the post of lecturer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 25, 1889._\r\n\r\n    I drew attention carefully in my first official report at the\r\n    Royal Agricultural Society of England (when the Committee began\r\n    again in November) to the need of caution [in connection with\r\n    Codlin moth prevention] as to the adulteration that there might\r\n    be in so-called cart grease, and also to the success of the plan\r\n    of before greasing putting paper round the trees. On the first\r\n    glance it might seem doubtful whether papering was not one of\r\n    the “study” applications which there are too many of, but it\r\n    answers so well, that at the great Toddington Fruit Grounds the\r\n    managers told me they were treating 120,000 trees in this way.\r\n    The paper is what is used by grocers as “grease proof.” It is\r\n    passed in a broad band round the tree, and the overlapping ends\r\n    fastened by paste and a band of bass mat or anything of that\r\n    kind tied round to make sure of all being firm, and on this the\r\n    “grease” is spread with a thin bit of wood—a sort of paper knife\r\n    in fact. This kind of paper would, I should conjecture, be more\r\n    certain to prevent the grease, &c., soaking into the tree than\r\n    cloth. I have lately received copies of analyses of two or three\r\n    kinds of cart grease which prove (in one case) to consist of\r\n    grease and tar oils mixed with water and sulphate of lime. This\r\n    did harm. Another consisted mainly of rosin oil, &c., mixed with\r\n    a little carbonate of lime. This, I believe, answered quite\r\n    well. I do not know how better to guard against mishaps than by\r\n    starting the very earliest intelligence of important points\r\n    round the newspapers as soon as ever I can; but you will believe\r\n    me it is difficult to meet all sides. A Kentish correspondent\r\n    wrote me that he was preparing his trees for dressing by cutting\r\n    all the old bark off and then was going to tar on the fresh\r\n    surface! If you would mention to your correspondent that my\r\n    report of this month is in the “Agricultural Gazette” for\r\n    November 18th, and that he would find some special cautions\r\n    about grease-banding at p. 501, column 1, I think he might be\r\n    interested, but if he cares to write to me on the subject I\r\n    would gladly reply, or I would with pleasure explain any point\r\n    to you that you would care to have details of.\r\n\r\n    In the second edition of my Manual, which I am doing all I\r\n    properly can to get time to start through press, I hope to give\r\n    the very valuable practical teaching of the last two years about\r\n    orchard insect pest prevention, and I hope to be able to add\r\n    good results of a special (very cheap and very nasty) kind of\r\n    fumigation we are going to try next spring.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—Do you see how the “I.L.N. Almanac” has been helping itself\r\n    to John Curtis’ figures and mine—and then giving the credit to\r\n    Mr. Jabez Hogg? I have had a little representation to make to\r\n    the editor, and an erratum slip is to be added to all unissued\r\n    copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _January 21, 1890._\r\n\r\n    We expect Professor Harker here at the end of the week. Most\r\n    likely he will come on here after his lecture at the Royal\r\n    Veterinary College, at 4 p.m. on Friday next, and stay till\r\n    Saturday, so we can bestow our best attention on affairs. I wish\r\n    I saw a more hopeful state of things in (or for) the various\r\n    matters [connected with entomological appointments].\r\n\r\n    Your letter came a few minutes after Professor Fream’s arrival,\r\n    and we said nothing about the lectures on Entomology in\r\n    Edinburgh, but I told him how affairs were standing about the\r\n    Board of Agriculture, and that I had recommended Professor\r\n    Harker in case an entomologist was wanted. He was very pleasant.\r\n    I have known him so long I always like a talk with him, and\r\n    amongst other points we went over some special work about\r\n    students’ entomological examinations, and he left the impression\r\n    on my mind that he would convey the requisite kind of\r\n    information for your proposed lectures very satisfactorily to\r\n    the hearers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 14, 1890._\r\n\r\n    Some time ago, before I knew that your University Entomological\r\n    Lectureship [Steven course] was in a sort of way private, I\r\n    mentioned something about it to Mr. James Fletcher (Dominion\r\n    entomologist), and he is delighted with the hoped-for advance.\r\n    He says how very much, if circumstances had allowed, he should\r\n    have liked to give the course. You would, indeed, have had “a\r\n    feather in your cap” if you could have secured him.\r\n\r\n    What a sad loss we all have in Professor Little.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 18, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I return your two lists marked.[96] What you want is a set of\r\n    cases with models and figures such as Mr. Mosley arranged for\r\n    Kew. I told him he ought not to sell at as low a rate as he at\r\n    first proposed, but I think that if strong card boxes were\r\n    substituted for the nicely-finished mahogany ones, he could\r\n    certainly let you have the cases at 7s. 6d. If you do not wish\r\n    to open the cases (excepting for very special work), the board\r\n    on which the exhibits are fixed might be fastened from below,\r\n    and thus the cost of the beautiful work of one half sliding\r\n    perfectly into the other half of the box saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 21, 1890._\r\n\r\n    I was lately down for a few days at Oxford, and took the\r\n    opportunity of asking Professor Westwood whether, if you\r\n    arranged to have a course of entomological lectures, and asked\r\n    him to deliver them, there was any chance of his granting such a\r\n    favour? I thought it was too much to hope for, but I gained his\r\n    permission that you might write to him on the subject, and I\r\n    really think that if it were so early that there was no fear of\r\n    cold setting in, he would very likely undertake the set.\r\n    Professor Westwood is, as Professor Riley well says, the “Prince\r\n    of entomologists.” I do not suppose any one living has such\r\n    knowledge extending over all branches of entomology as he has.\r\n    He is the Hope Professor of Zoology at Oxford, so constantly in\r\n    practice of lecturing on his own special subject, and very fond\r\n    of making things clear to young people. He has attended greatly\r\n    to the economic aspect, and if you could secure him, his\r\n    lectures as the commencement of the Agriculture Entomological\r\n    course would give an _éclat_ to the series that nothing else in\r\n    the whole world would. To say he is Life President of the\r\n    Entomological Society shows the respect he is held in on all\r\n    hands. But you would have to be very careful of the good old\r\n    man, for he never thinks of his 82 or 83 years, and he is not\r\n    strong, though much more full of spirit than many a younger man.\r\n    His address is: Professor J. O. Westwood, Walton Manor,\r\n    Woodstock-road, Oxford. If you write to him he will think it\r\n    over and tell you his views.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _July 7, 1891._\r\n\r\n    It is very kind of you to give me the copy (received this\r\n    morning) of your beautiful and so very useful book.\r\n    [“Agriculture and Rural Economy of Australia and New Zealand.”]\r\n    I have been turning over a good many pages so as to have some\r\n    idea of the contents before writing to thank you, and I cannot\r\n    think how you could manage to collect all this very serviceable\r\n    information there, or find time to condense it into this clear,\r\n    readable form here. It is a very valuable addition to my\r\n    library, and I value it much for its own worth, as well as your\r\n    kind gift. How very honestly indeed you have acknowledged my\r\n    little Cockchafer block; it is quite a pleasure to me to have it\r\n    in your grand book.\r\n\r\n    I hope you have escaped the influenza, or had it favourably. It\r\n    has been a serious visitation to us. My sister and I, and our\r\n    housekeeper, Miss Hartwell, who acts as my amanuensis, were all\r\n    seriously laid up in our beds at once! Such a time of misery,\r\n    and inconvenience! I should like to write you about sundry\r\n    matters of interest, but as very likely you are on the other\r\n    side of the world, I had better postpone them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Somewhat Private._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 18, 1892._\r\n\r\n    I am very sorry to hear of your trouble in the loss of your\r\n    brother,[97] and with your grief, and also the effects of the\r\n    long hard run of work, you must be greatly needing a rest.\r\n\r\n    I hope and greatly desire to continue all my work, Home,\r\n    Colonial, and publishing; also to act as referee to our\r\n    Agricultural Journals just as before, but it is much more\r\n    comfortable working up important points, to having everlastingly\r\n    to be going over a routine often keeping one from attending to\r\n    what may be of importance. Who will they get to take my place\r\n    [at the Royal]? It seems to me a great pity that there is not a\r\n    properly paid and competent officer for the Board of Agriculture\r\n    and R.A.S.E. I am safe in saying this, for I never intend to\r\n    take office again, not for any amount of money that could be\r\n    offered, neither do I mean to do the work of Government or\r\n    Society under the polite name of “kindly co-operating!”\r\n\r\n    The only person I know who appears to me to be qualified to take\r\n    the post at the Royal Agricultural Society is Dr. Fream, and I\r\n    conjecture that his hands are much too full to allow it. Still I\r\n    should be glad if it were so. Professor Harker has great\r\n    knowledge of beetles, and indeed, I believe, of insect ways and\r\n    customs generally, but I should scarcely think his tastes would\r\n    lead him to this sort of work. However I have not the least idea\r\n    what the R.A.S.E. proposes to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 15, 1895._\r\n\r\n    As the time of your African trip is drawing near, I am just\r\n    venturing to remind you, with what pleasure (if consistent with\r\n    your own convenience) we would see you before you go. There\r\n    appears to me to be a Gordian knot, and a few words (spoken not\r\n    written) sometimes are invaluable on these occasions. I am\r\n    pulling well with the European centres, but there are places\r\n    where, much as I regret it, co-operation is not going on, and I\r\n    think I might very likely get, as on a previous occasion, some\r\n    most useful advice from yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 9, 1895._\r\n\r\n    I am very sorry and disappointed to say that I am ailing and so\r\n    I do not know whether in your own hardly run time, you would\r\n    care (or could at all spare the while) to run down for an hour\r\n    or two on Thursday. The special trouble is that lately a very\r\n    small bit of glass jerked up from something I was doing at my\r\n    right eye. I thought it only hit the eye, but nearly a week\r\n    after I found injury resulted from the bit having embedded\r\n    itself in the upper part of the eyeball and formed a small\r\n    abscess. Of course it had to be operated on and I hope put all\r\n    right, but the very long, weary operation and the cocaine, &c.,\r\n    &c., have so tired everything concerned that I have not got over\r\n    it all yet. So I thought I ought to tell you. What I want to say\r\n    as distinguished from writing is more in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 19, 1896._\r\n\r\n    I make no doubt that I shall hear from our good friend Dr. Fream\r\n    very shortly, or at least as soon as his much occupied time\r\n    permits, but meanwhile I do not like to delay thanking you for\r\n    kindly letting me know that the University Court had paid me the\r\n    very gratifying compliment of appointing me co-examiner with Dr.\r\n    Fream[98] in Agricultural Entomology. I think myself much\r\n    honoured and much pleased also by their selection. If I might\r\n    ask you to take the trouble, and it should be admissible, I\r\n    should much like you to express to the University Court my\r\n    grateful appreciation and assurance that I will endeavour to do\r\n    whatever may be required in the office to the best of my\r\n    ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 27, 1896._\r\n\r\n    I am really very greatly obliged to you for the clear and\r\n    full explanation you have spared time to give me, in your\r\n    letter received this afternoon, of the arrangement of my\r\n    co-examinership. It does please me very much to have even\r\n    this little post, for I look on it as a mark of approval of\r\n    your grand old University; also I am very glad that you\r\n    approved of my letter to the Secretary.\r\n\r\n    I never knew the injurious insects so active as they have been\r\n    this winter, in air, earth, and water—in the latter to the great\r\n    damage of watercress (chap. XVI.). I had yesterday, some good\r\n    specimens of great mischief from clover-stem sickness and for\r\n    the first time found a nice way of collecting quantities of the\r\n    _Anguillulidæ_ (eel-worms) for observation. Generally they hide\r\n    up in the rubbish, but I found that by teazing it out very\r\n    finely in water on the slide and then carefully lifting it all\r\n    away until the slide looked bare, that still such numbers of the\r\n    eel-worms remained that they could be thoroughly examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 4, 1896._\r\n\r\n    I am now writing to you on a point on which I think that you—_ex\r\n    officio_—are the first I should consult, and I should greatly\r\n    like your opinion; and next (if, as I hope, you approve of my\r\n    sister’s and my own proposed presentation), that you will kindly\r\n    tell me to whom to apply in requisite form. We have, by request\r\n    of the Council of the Bath and West Society, been preparing an\r\n    exhibit of Economic Entomology for their approaching Show here.\r\n    My sister’s part consists of twenty coloured diagrams, nineteen\r\n    injurious insects and their works, and one finger and toe—these\r\n    are very beautifully executed and fitted with loops all ready\r\n    for hanging; size 26 ins. long by 21 wide. My part is seventeen\r\n    cases—of which the enclosed slips, to be affixed on light\r\n    slanting strips of wood at end or side of the cases, give just a\r\n    general idea for observers without a catalogue (Appendix C.). I\r\n    have tried, you will see, to give just a few illustrations of\r\n    the main sorts of attack. Scientific names are used of course,\r\n    but it is essentially an Agricultural Entomological exhibition\r\n    made to help the plainest understanding, so I have not taken up\r\n    space with mere scientific details, and I have spared neither\r\n    trouble nor cost in procuring specimens, especially of the\r\n    various _Œstridæ_ (bot-flies). Also that there might be no\r\n    possible doubt as to accuracy of nomenclature I got Mr. O. E.\r\n    Janson to spend two or three hours in rigid investigation, and\r\n    the only error in naming he found was in the name, or synonym,\r\n    of a decayed wood-eating wireworm-beetle which I removed to make\r\n    all sure. Fifteen of the cases are white pine, with what I call\r\n    “detection” fittings outside. The glass is laid on the top but\r\n    is kept in place by a handsome narrow brass band. Thus the\r\n    inside of the case is at once accessible for any authorised\r\n    purpose; but those not knowing the arrangements would cause such\r\n    a clatter and disturbance that their misdoings would be very\r\n    public. The cases are all as nearly as may be 12 ins. by 8 by\r\n    2½. Two of them completing the seventeen are “Live Boxes” of\r\n    polished mahogany, same size, but of different make to prevent\r\n    escape.\r\n\r\n    Now, I much want you to tell us whether you think that after\r\n    exhibition here the collection, including my sister’s diagrams,\r\n    would be acceptable as a presentation to the museum of your\r\n    Edinburgh University. It is not for me to speak of my own work,\r\n    but I think it would be of use both in your work and Dr.\r\n    Fream’s, so I am writing to you first of all. If approved and we\r\n    can arrange comfortably, I contemplate sending it (at my own\r\n    cost) in charge of an expert who could repair damage. I shall\r\n    wait your reply with great interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 16, 1896._\r\n\r\n    Indeed, I thank you heartily for your kind letter of the 13th.\r\n    It is a very great pleasure both to my sister and myself that\r\n    you think our collection likely to be of use. I thought perhaps\r\n    you had started on your long tour, so I wrote to Dr. Taylor, and\r\n    yesterday we had a letter from him which pleased us exceedingly,\r\n    with the kindly expressed acceptance of the University Court;\r\n    and Sir W. Muir also was good enough to write, which we took to\r\n    be very kind of him. I shall hope now, all being well, to\r\n    collect, and (with permission) add as occasion allows. You would\r\n    notice that some of the great attacks, _Tipula_ (Daddy\r\n    longlegs), leather-jacket _grubs_, for instance, and _Charæas\r\n    graminis_ (Antler moth), were not represented, for they were not\r\n    about in the winter, but I shall hope to go on now. I should\r\n    like you to see the cases, and we should much like a chat before\r\n    you go; it is long since we met, and as the collection will not\r\n    be free to go down till a little after the beginning of June, I\r\n    suppose you will be far away then? I do not know the difference\r\n    between the University Court and the Senatus. Very ridiculous\r\n    you will think this; but I should like to understand about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 30, 1896._\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for your letter received this afternoon, with\r\n    address of Sir Robert Murdoch Smith [the curator]. From this I\r\n    understand that the collection is to be placed in the “Museum of\r\n    Science and Art,” Chambers Street, as the property of the\r\n    University Court of Edinburgh University? You will think me\r\n    tedious, but I was under an impression that there was a\r\n    “University Museum” _pur et simple_. I should not be easy at all\r\n    in sending the exhibit down excepting in skilled hands. I had\r\n    the great pleasure yesterday of showing them to the Prince and\r\n    Princess (p. 123), and to-day I hear there is such a crowd that\r\n    even our own people could only get a sight of two cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVII.\r\n  Yours truly\r\n  Georgiana E. Ormerod\r\n\r\n  MISS GEORGIANA ELIZABETH ORMEROD.\r\n  _Photo by Elliott & Fry._\r\n  (_pp. 16, 30, 37, 88, 90, 123._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 22, 1896._\r\n\r\n    I was very much pleased to see this morning that you had\r\n    returned safe from your long journey to Australia, and I hope\r\n    that besides the immense quantity of useful work which I make no\r\n    doubt you have done, that you have come back in better health.\r\n    You will have heard that my dear sister has gone from me; and\r\n    for her I can be very happy, but I do miss her exceedingly.\r\n\r\n    But I am now writing to you about a little bit of business. When\r\n    her failing health allowed, her great pleasure after you saw her\r\n    was to execute some more diagrams, beautifully done, and I am\r\n    sure there is no situation where she would have been more\r\n    gratified for them to be placed than in Edinburgh University—and\r\n    yesterday evening I had a truly kind letter from Sir Wm. Muir,\r\n    telling me of the acceptance of my offer of them by the Senatus\r\n    and University Court. But at present I am not able to lay my\r\n    hand on her list of what was formerly sent. Would you mind the\r\n    trouble of letting me have just the shortest possible notes of\r\n    the subjects—a couple of words to each as Hessian fly, Wireworm,\r\n    &c., would be quite enough—and then without fear of repetition I\r\n    can present all the others to the University (excepting two or\r\n    three which I should like to keep for her dear sake); and will\r\n    you kindly further help me by letting me know at your\r\n    convenience to whom I should address the package.\r\n\r\n    But though my dear sister did not work technically on my reports\r\n    any more than I did on her beautiful drawings, I greatly miss\r\n    her sympathy and colleagueship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 24, 1897._\r\n\r\n    I cannot say that I am well. The worry and hard extra work and\r\n    my bad fall on the stone steps were not good for me, and I am\r\n    painfully lame, and have got the gout, my doctor said a day or\r\n    two ago, everywhere.\r\n\r\n    However, I am getting better, and hope to be much as usual soon.\r\n    To-day I am looking up “Pine beetle.” I think a trustworthy\r\n    record of a thousand acres of Pine without (so far as seen) a\r\n    tree not infested is a grand observation. This is a consequence\r\n    of the 1893 and 1894 gales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _January 30, 1899._\r\n\r\n    I take it very kind indeed of you to write to tell me of the\r\n    University arrangements about the Examinership.[99] I consider\r\n    it a great honour to have held the office, and it has been a\r\n    most thorough pleasure also thus to be associated in work with\r\n    such a kind friend as yourself, as well as with Dr. Fream. But\r\n    still, though not now one of the staff, I can work in\r\n    colleagueship, and I have never forgotten the important help\r\n    that you gave me some years ago. I shall look forward very much\r\n    to a visit from you presently; besides the pleasure, it would\r\n    help me, to have a good talk.\r\n\r\n    I am intending to make an alteration about my yearly reports. It\r\n    seems to me that it would be the best course to bring the\r\n    present series to a close with this number, giving with it a\r\n    collective index of the whole series up to date. I should like\r\n    the twenty-two years’ work to stand complete, and not be liable\r\n    to detraction, gradually, as to regret about Miss Ormerod not\r\n    being this, that, and the other, which with advancing years is\r\n    likely. I think, too, that I need a little consultation as to\r\n    some slight alteration of plan. I do not like so much repetition\r\n    as I see elsewhere. I have difficulty in avoiding it, and I am\r\n    trying that my present Twenty-second Annual Report should be as\r\n    fresh as I can make it.\r\n\r\n                                 Kind regards from, yours sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO PROFESSOR WALLACE ON THE LL.D. OF THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH\r\n\r\nAnnouncement of the Honorary LL.D. to be conferred—Preliminary personal\r\n    arrangements—Miss Ormerod’s feelings of appreciation and of\r\n    anxiety—Letters of congratulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter is unlike any of the foregoing chapters of correspondence\r\nin its purely personal character. Interested readers will not fail to\r\nrecognise in it the genuine feminine feeling of anxiety at the approach\r\nof a trying public ordeal to one so unaccustomed as Miss Ormerod to the\r\npageantry of academic functions. Nor will they fail to appreciate the\r\nresolution with which she bore the physical strain put upon one whose\r\nstrength had been well-nigh spent in the cause of science under a load\r\nof years and bodily infirmities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _To Miss E. A. Ormerod._\r\n\r\n                                            UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH,\r\n                                                _February 24, 1900_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—I hasten to announce to you without a\r\n    moment’s delay that the Senatus of this University have only a\r\n    minute ago agreed to do our University the distinguished honour\r\n    of asking you to accept the honorary degree of LL.D. of the\r\n    University. I may tell you without breaking any confidence that\r\n    you are not only the first lady who has ever been asked to\r\n    accept the degree, but it was in view of the necessity of\r\n    recognising the great and distinguished labours which you have\r\n    done for Science that regulations were made by which it became\r\n    possible for us to confer the degree upon a lady. Any little\r\n    share I had in this matter is more than rewarded by the great\r\n    gratification which I feel in connection with this proposed act\r\n    of the Senatus, of which I believe you will most probably hear\r\n    by the same post from the Principal. Should the announcement\r\n    come a day later this will serve as a private intimation to\r\n    yourself. It will be a still further triumph if you feel\r\n    physically able to come to receive the degree in the presence of\r\n    an assembly of about 3,000 people—the number who usually attend\r\n    our graduations. If you are not able to come, of course the\r\n    degree will be conferred all the same, but personally I would\r\n    rejoice, if it can be without your running a serious risk, to\r\n    see you among us and to get your name enrolled among the many\r\n    distinguished men—all men but yourself—who have distinguished\r\n    themselves in Science and Literature, and been pleased to accept\r\n    our degree.—I am, dear Miss Ormerod, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                     ROBERT WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Fream, “Steven” lecturer on Agricultural Entomology in Edinburgh\r\nUniversity, wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       DOWNTON, _February 26, 1900_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—As I have to catch a train I have only\r\n    time to write you my very warmest congratulations on the LL.D.\r\n    It was really settled a month ago, but had to be confirmed on\r\n    Friday. Of course the secret “burnt” a little, but I was pledged\r\n    to say nothing about it! It will appear in the University\r\n    Intelligence shortly. The honour was never better won, and long\r\n    may you enjoy it is the earnest wish of, in haste,—Yours very\r\n    sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                           W. FREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _To Professor Robert Wallace, University, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST. ALBANS,\r\n                                                _February 25, 1900_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—I feel wholly unable to express my\r\n    respectful and sincere gratitude to the Senatus for such a high\r\n    honour, and to yourself I am greatly indebted for your kind\r\n    friendship and also letting me hear so soon. I value the honour\r\n    exceedingly—the seal of approval of this highly scientific body.\r\n    When the letter arrives which you tell me is coming I will\r\n    endeavour to express myself to some degree adequately. To\r\n    yourself just quietly I may say it is a pleasure, and such an\r\n    unexampled honour that I am delighted. But still I feel that the\r\n    great point of my work always is utilising the exceedingly kind\r\n    help which is so cordially given me by my good, kind, scientific\r\n    friends, and the practical observations to sift into shape that\r\n    are given me as the foundation. If you were here I should like\r\n    to say so much, but I do not know how to write more at present\r\n    than that I am deeply grateful.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—I wish very much indeed to come, as you kindly suggest, but\r\n    my very great and painful difficulty in walking movement from\r\n    arthritis makes me fear that the risk would be too great, but\r\n    anyway I am going to ask my doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 27, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Your exceedingly kind letter and the subject of it were such a\r\n    surprise to me that in all the ideas suddenly arising I hardly\r\n    know how to reply coherently. Now at least I can say I am\r\n    deeply, respectfully grateful for such an honour to be granted\r\n    me. I have written in reply to the formal notification from the\r\n    Senatus what I hope may be a proper reply. I also mentioned that\r\n    I trusted to be able to attend in person to receive this great\r\n    honour. But now I hope you will be so good as to allow me to ask\r\n    your help in arrangements. [Here followed a list of queries\r\n    which are not of general interest.] Of course on such, to me,\r\n    very great occasion I do not in the least mind expense.\r\n\r\n    The other matter is, Will you please tell me am I to wear Doctor\r\n    of Laws’ dress? and if so, will you kindly say to whom I should\r\n    write to order it? When I come I am hoping you will instruct me\r\n    in what to do, for unless you are good enough to help me with a\r\n    little (or a great deal) of instruction I am afraid I am likely\r\n    to be quite out of order.\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              UNIVERSITY, EDINBURGH,\r\n                                                    _March 1, 1900_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—I am delighted to see from your letter\r\n    received this morning that you are going to be able to come to\r\n    the graduation function, and that you have arranged to be well\r\n    cared for on the way up. I shall take full responsibility for\r\n    all necessary arrangements at this end. I should have done a lot\r\n    to-day and reported progress to you, but unfortunately I have to\r\n    go out of town to give a lecture on South Africa at Cauvin’s\r\n    Hospital, but I may tell you that I can easily secure the\r\n    accommodation you mention for yourself, Miss Hartwell, and the\r\n    doctor. You will wear a black cloak or graduation gown thrown\r\n    over your ordinary dress very much like a Minister’s robe. This\r\n    is hired for a few shillings from a man who supplies them\r\n    regularly to Honorary Graduates, and I shall arrange all about\r\n    that. A silk hood goes round the neck and hangs down the back.\r\n    It is put on by the head Servitor after you have been officially\r\n    capped by the Principal. It is part of the public function. You\r\n    must not feel the least anxious about the event, as you will be\r\n    surrounded by a host of people to whom your name is a household\r\n    word, who know well the value which your work has been to this\r\n    country, and who appreciate you accordingly. I shall be only too\r\n    pleased to answer any question of detail you may write and help\r\n    you in every way.\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                     ROBERT WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 2, 1900._\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—I am very glad to know some part of what\r\n    the form is on this great occasion. I hope that by following\r\n    whatever directions you give me quite exactly that all will be\r\n    right, _i.e._, that I may do all I ought to do! But I cannot\r\n    help being a little nervous; I feel the honour so very great\r\n    indeed, and also the kindness I am receiving. Your account of\r\n    the ceremony itself has made my mind much clearer. Walking\r\n    upstairs is a great difficulty to me, but on flat ground, with\r\n    my light ebony stick, I do not think my lameness is more than a\r\n    very little observable. I am as near as possible 5 feet 6\r\n    inches. This is relative to the graduation gown. My head really\r\n    is so full of this unprecedented distinction I am afraid I\r\n    trouble you too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 7, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged to you indeed for all the care that you\r\n    have been so kindly taking for me, and for making everything so\r\n    clear to me—amongst other points, your little note about\r\n    convenience of cheques. I think you have arranged everything as\r\n    nicely as possible for me. All matters for the journey I expect\r\n    my doctor will look after nicely. But when you write again,—I\r\n    suppose on the great occasion, as the cap is to be put on, that\r\n    I appear without a bonnet? I have now read your letter over\r\n    again that I may be quite sure that I thoroughly understand\r\n    everything.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—There is yet one more inquiry I am venturing to trouble you\r\n    with. My doctor [Dr. Eustace Lipscomb] is an M.B. (Cambridge);\r\n    on such a special occasion, should he wear his hood?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 3, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I shall be very much obliged if you would secure me rooms at the\r\n    Balmoral Hotel, as you mention. Namely, a sitting-room and two\r\n    bedrooms with doors opening one from the other, on the first\r\n    floor to the front, for Miss Hartwell [Private Secretary] and\r\n    myself, likewise a room for the doctor—from the evening (8 p.m.)\r\n    on Wednesday the 11th until about nine on the following Sunday\r\n    evening. I should like to be at the Balmoral; I have heard of it\r\n    as such a good hotel. I can manage, though the operation is\r\n    painful, to walk up just a few steps with the help of my stick\r\n    (I have been trying five at my door), if somebody be by me in\r\n    case I should slip, without, I think, attracting attention; and\r\n    if I were too lame after the long journey to manage nicely, then\r\n    I must be humble, and be thankful to be carried in a chair.\r\n\r\n    I feel greatly obliged to Sir Ludovic Grant for his kind\r\n    intention of asking me to stay at his house. It would have been\r\n    very pleasant, for thus, also, I should have doubtless seen many\r\n    kind friends; but besides the great difficulty of the stairs, I\r\n    am obliged to lie down a little each day, and I think after the\r\n    long journey I had best keep quiet to fit me for the great day\r\n    on Saturday.\r\n\r\n    But if the thing be possible without intruding on valuable time,\r\n    might I not hope to see some of my kind friends at the\r\n    hotel—yourself, of course, and I shall also be delighted to see\r\n    Dr. MacDougall. Could you arrange some time? I should not myself\r\n    see anything wrong in seeing friends on the afternoon of Good\r\n    Friday, but pray do not let me do anything that might be thought\r\n    not right. You and I will have a good deal to say at your best\r\n    convenience.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—I was greatly gratified to learn that my letter to Sir L.\r\n    Grant met with his approval. It was a matter of no small anxiety\r\n    to me to try at least to express my appreciation rightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 14, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I got a friend here to let me try on the square college cap\r\n    “mortar board,” and it fitted so nicely over my bow that I do\r\n    not think I should be at all troubled by ideas of anything\r\n    unusual being on my head; and I can take it off without trouble.\r\n    Through your kind help I think all these arrangements are in\r\n    perfect order, and I am looking forward much (preliminarily) to\r\n    our meeting at Balmoral Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 27, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I should have liked to beg a ticket besides the two which you\r\n    kindly mention for my nephew, Arthur Ormerod, who has just taken\r\n    his M.D., so I wired off to him at Oxford, but, to his great\r\n    regret, he cannot come. I hope the weather will be better, but\r\n    we have a good bright sunshine between the occasional light snow\r\n    showers, and both Miss Hartwell and myself have good furred\r\n    mantles, and with the snug small carriage all our own way, I\r\n    think we shall do very well.\r\n\r\n    What a sight the hall will be! also your small flock of aspirant\r\n    doctors; may be as anxious in their minds as some one I know of.\r\n    But I am really not alarmed. I am sure you will keep me right.\r\n    What time of day does the ceremony begin? And what happens\r\n    after?—do we retire respectively like rabbits to our own\r\n    burrows?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 29, 1900._\r\n\r\n    The pamphlet on the McEwan Hall [the number of the “Student”\r\n    describing the opening of the Hall] is a great boon to me, and\r\n    what a noble building!\r\n\r\n    While in Edinburgh my idea is to have lunch at one o’clock, my\r\n    usual time, and a sort of miscellaneous meal at 6.30, and rest\r\n    in the evening after it, and I shall think it a great compliment\r\n    and a very great pleasure if friends may do me the favour to\r\n    look in after, say, about two o’clock. It will be much safer for\r\n    me, under present circumstances of wanting to keep fresh and\r\n    strong for the day, not to go out, so I should be on the spot.\r\n    Sir Wm. Muir and his daughter, Mrs. Arbuthnot, kindly wrote that\r\n    they meant to look in, but it would be only a pleasure to me to\r\n    see any friends. Please to consider me as quite under your\r\n    guidance for this, to me, so very great occasion, and wholly\r\n    thankful so to be, excepting in the feeling of the great trouble\r\n    that you are kindly taking.\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—Dr. E. L. thought it would be best for me to return by the\r\n    Sunday night sleeping train, and the Midland manager has given\r\n    permission for it to stop here on Monday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Professor Wallace to Miss E. A. Ormerod._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH,\r\n                                                   _March 29, 1900_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—The box containing your most valuable\r\n    contribution to the library arrived safely from Wesley & Son,\r\n    and the ten volumes, [of her own works] all in excellent order,\r\n    are standing on the Senate Hall table so that they may be seen.\r\n    The Principal, Sir Wm. Muir, and the Secretary, Sir L. Grant,\r\n    were the first, along with Professor Patrick and me, to inspect\r\n    them in their present position, and all the others excepting\r\n    myself were astounded at the magnitude of your work. I carried\r\n    the books first into the library and had them entered in the\r\n    catalogue before they went to the Senate Hall. They will have a\r\n    shelf for themselves, so that they can be kept together as the\r\n    “Ormerod Collection,” or rather “presentation.” I sent you a\r\n    “Student” giving details of the Hall in which you will be\r\n    capped. The capping is at 10 a.m., and after that, if you feel\r\n    able, you will go on to St. Giles’ Cathedral. I enclose one of\r\n    the ordinary tickets to give you an idea as to how the general\r\n    public are admitted.—(R. W.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 30, 1900._\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—What can I say? I am very much used to\r\n    work just quietly in the hope of being of some service, but this\r\n    kind commendation from those whose opinions I hold in such\r\n    respect as those of the chiefs, whether the high officials or\r\n    professors in your great University, is indeed a gratification,\r\n    a comfort for troubles sometimes not light, and an encouragement\r\n    which I gratefully and deeply appreciate.\r\n\r\n    I should like, of all things, if you will take charge of me, to\r\n    attend the Commemoration Service after the capping. It will\r\n    delight me to be there, and if I am tired I can rest after. [The\r\n    graduation ceremonial was found to be quite enough for Miss\r\n    Ormerod’s strength, and no attempt was made to go to St. Giles’\r\n    Cathedral to the service.] I usually breakfast at 8.15, so that\r\n    I should be all ready at 10 o’clock. It seems to me that if the\r\n    “low-hung carriage” which you have kindly secured use of for me\r\n    were in attendance to convey us to the McEwan Hall, and when\r\n    wanted at intervals onward, this would be exceedingly\r\n    comfortable for me. But in everything of the arrangements I am\r\n    hoping that all I have to do is to quite precisely obey as well\r\n    as benefit by most thankfully all that you are good enough to\r\n    arrange for me, and will instruct me about presently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          BALMORAL HOTEL, EDINBURGH,\r\n                                                   _April 12, 1900_.\r\n\r\n    I earnestly hope that Dr. E. Lipscomb will find you better. It\r\n    is a real grief to me that you should be going through such a\r\n    painful illness [an influenza cold which developed at a most\r\n    inopportune moment]. And, secondarily, not having all your kind\r\n    advice and help and your companionship in all, does take away\r\n    much of the pleasure of my honour.\r\n\r\n    We find the gown, hood, and trencher cap fit very nicely. This\r\n    cap suits me much better than the soft velvet one, and I am sure\r\n    that I should much prefer the black gown to the amazing\r\n    splendours of scarlet faced with blue. I think on formal\r\n    occasions, if desirable, I could get up my courage to wearing\r\n    the quiet black gown, but I should be terrified about the\r\n    brilliant garment. Dr. Lipscomb is going to tell you that, as\r\n    matters have progressed, I do not feel as if it were at all\r\n    necessary for me to have the convenience of a room in the Hall\r\n    you kindly procured for me, and if it were permissible for me to\r\n    “robe” here, and drive robed to the McEwan Hall, it would save\r\n    me a world of anxiety. I might, I think, carry my cap in my hand\r\n    until time for capping came. It is so exceptional a case that I\r\n    do not see any impropriety in being bare-headed for a while. But\r\n    I am truly anxious that I should appear before all the august\r\n    body preliminarily under your wing, or, if there was risk for\r\n    you, under the care of some other member of the University (if\r\n    they will adopt me).\r\n\r\n    [The graduation ceremonial (p. 95) passed off without a hitch of\r\n    any kind, and the students gave the first honorary woman\r\n    graduate a magnificent reception.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       TORRINGTON HOUSE, ST.

There is so very much I want to say and to thank you\r\n    most heartily for. But first I should exceedingly like to know\r\n    that you are recovering, and were not seriously the worse for\r\n    your kindness in really and truly coming from your bed to look\r\n    after me. It would have taken greatly from my downright pleasure\r\n    if you had not been there. I was much impressed by the\r\n    ceremonial. I had not connected an idea of the perfect order,\r\n    and in some respects solemnity, with the function of graduation.\r\n    It is an impression never to be forgotten, any more than the\r\n    exceeding kindness with which I was received. “Dr. Ormerod” also\r\n    begs her best thanks for the most liberal supply of “Edinburgh\r\n    Evening Dispatch” and “Scotsman” received this morning\r\n    [containing accounts of the University function]. I am putting\r\n    your letter, the very first with address of “Doctorate,”\r\n    carefully away amongst the special treasures of my Academic\r\n    honour. I am trying to get, so to say, “into harness” again\r\n    amongst the consignments of boxes waiting.\r\n\r\n    Now I hope you will not think me absolutely carried away by the\r\n    feeling of the importance of the honour to myself, but amongst\r\n    letters of congratulation I have one from Dr. L. O. Howard, the\r\n    Entomologist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which\r\n    pleases me very much. He says:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Dating WASHINGTON, D.C., _April 7, 1900_.\r\n\r\n        “The receipt of your letter of 21st March and of your\r\n        admirable twenty-third Annual Report reminds me that I\r\n        have been remiss in fulfilling a strong intention to\r\n        write you at my earliest convenience and congratulate\r\n        you most warmly on the well-deserved honour which you\r\n        are to receive from the University of Edinburgh. You are\r\n        right; not only is it an honour to yourself, but it is\r\n        an honour to Economic Entomology, the force of which\r\n        cannot be over-estimated. I congratulate you very\r\n        warmly. An LL.D. from Edinburgh has always seemed to me\r\n        to be one of the highest honours which an Englishman (or\r\n        woman now) could gain.”\r\n\r\n                                                   L.

Stewart MacDougall wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SCOTTISH LIBERAL CLUB, EDINBURGH, _Saturday_.\r\n\r\n    A telegram received in the morning made it impossible for me to\r\n    get to the McEwan Hall in time for my seat on the platform.\r\n    Among the audience, however, I had an excellent opportunity of\r\n    getting acquainted with “popular” opinion, and I only wished you\r\n    could have heard all the kind things that were said about you.\r\n    Somebody has said, “Beware when all men (and all women) speak\r\n    well of you.” Really I know no one so exposed to this temptation\r\n    (if temptation it be) as yourself. The honouring of our various\r\n    distinguished men naturally appeals most strongly to different\r\n    groups, but there is in addition about this latest honour to\r\n    yourself something which has touched the general imagination.\r\n\r\n    May you be long spared to wear the honour worthily.\r\n\r\n    I hope that on your return you will find yourself none the worse\r\n    for your plucky journey north and all the attendant fatigue.\r\n\r\n                                              R.

I am glad to hear that the\r\n    important work you have done since so long years for Science and\r\n    for Agriculture will be recompensed in this way. I hope that you\r\n    may remain still for many years, what you have been already for\r\n    so long time, the first Economic Entomologist of your country\r\n    and one of the most famous Economic Entomologists of the world.\r\n    My wife asks me to offer also her kind congratulations to you.\r\n    December 19, 1899, it was twenty-five years since I received the\r\n    Degree of Doctor of Natural Philosophy. On this day a deputation\r\n    of representatives of our Dutch Agriculture and Horticulture\r\n    came to me and offered me a statue of bronze—the genius of\r\n    Science, with the subscription, “Ad lumen.” It was presented to\r\n    me in the name of many agriculturists and horticulturists in\r\n    Holland and in Dutch India. The General Director of Agriculture\r\n    came also to me, and told me that H.M. our Queen offered me the\r\n    grade of Knight of the Dutch Lion (Ridder in de Orde von den\r\n    Nederlandsche Leeuwen). It was a beautiful day for us indeed.\r\n    With many kind regards, believe me, yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                        RITZEMA BOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Grimthorpe wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  ST. ALBANS, _Ash Wednesday, 1900_.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—“I lose not a moment” (as the story is) in\r\n    congratulating you, or myself, on the honour of our becoming a\r\n    brother and sister in _Laws_, as one of my nieces points out in\r\n    a newspaper. The Princess of Wales has only the inferior\r\n    position of a sister in Music, and those in Medicine are quite\r\n    common now. I am sorry that we, neither of us, dare venture to\r\n    go out and pay our duty in person in this weather—as unique as\r\n    your new position—and I was sorry to miss you the last time you\r\n    came here. My dear wife, who has been worse than I am though\r\n    more capable of recovery, is slowly doing so. She was in an\r\n    alarming state for some time under the abominable influence of\r\n    the general pest, influenza.\r\n\r\n    Though I write badly and with difficulty, I am better in general\r\n    strength, but shall never be well. However, I am thankful to be\r\n    no worse, and to have a nice series of benevolent relations of\r\n    two generations here, and to be here instead of London or Bath.\r\n    Tea generally goes on at 4½ now, and we shall hope not to be\r\n    disappointed if you look in again, wearing your _red hood_ when\r\n    you have acquired it. With very kind regards and rejoicings from\r\n    all our ladies.\r\n\r\n                                                   I am, yours ever,\r\n                                                         GRIMTHORPE.\r\n\r\n    N.B.—I hope you are duly elated at the prospect of a Dean and\r\n    Chapter here. I defied the late Archdeacon Grant who agitated\r\n    for it, to tell us definitely any single practical bit of good\r\n    it could do, and he declined to try.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. L. O. Howard wrote again on:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 10, 1900._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—I am greatly pleased to receive your\r\n    letter of April 30th with the newspaper clippings. I had read\r\n    substantially the same account in American newspapers, but did\r\n    not know, of course, of your pleasant meeting with Mr. Choate.\r\n    He is a man who is highly esteemed on this side of the Atlantic,\r\n    not only for his legal ability but for his tact and other good\r\n    qualities. I do not know him personally, but he is a national\r\n    character. His name is known from one end of the country to the\r\n    other, and his clever sayings are repeated from Seattle to Key\r\n    West, and from Portland to San Diego. In March I attended the\r\n    annual banquet of the trustees of the Shaw Botanic Gardens in\r\n    St. Louis, and responded to the toast of Henry Shaw. The man who\r\n    sat at my right, a distinguished college president, told me many\r\n    Choate stories, and succeeded in filling my mind so full of Mr.\r\n    Choate that when I was called upon to speak I had almost\r\n    forgotten what I had intended to say. We are all of us here\r\n    delighted about your doctorate. Entomology and Economic\r\n    Entomology have been steadily assuming a higher place in the\r\n    minds of the people during the past twenty years, and this\r\n    honour which has come to you is the culmination of our advance\r\n    up to the present time. Wishing you many more years of work and\r\n    happiness (work must mean happiness to you), believe me, my dear\r\n    Miss Ormerod, sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                       L.

My\r\n    journey was not so successful as I hoped. The wind was very cold\r\n    on St. Albans’ platform and I got a chill, but I was up again\r\n    yesterday, and hope to be just as usual in a day or two. I shall\r\n    be so very glad to see you. Please fix your own time, and if you\r\n    would tell me a little beforehand, I would try to get General\r\n    and Mrs. Bigge to come to lunch. He I think knew Sir Wm. Muir in\r\n    India, when he (General Bigge) was in military command. He would\r\n    of all things enjoy a talk with you about horses.\r\n\r\n    One day (if you please that is) we would drive over to Batch\r\n    Wood to tea, and Lord Grimthorpe will certainly come in and have\r\n    a chat if he be well enough. In a parenthesis, would you care to\r\n    drive over to Rothamsted? I know Sir Henry and Lady Gilbert and\r\n    Mr. Warington.\r\n\r\n    I shall so like to be able to have a good quiet talk with you\r\n    about various of my plans. I feel (may I be forgiven if I am too\r\n    presumptuous) that now I have a real scientific home, and though\r\n    I would not for the world intrude, I may I think ask my good\r\n    colleague’s advice. As you will be here so soon I think I had\r\n    best not write to Sir W. Muir, as he kindly gave me leave to do,\r\n    about my father’s set of volumes of drawings. When you come you\r\n    will guide my views as to whether they would be what might be\r\n    liked for acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 23, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am doing just as you bid me, and after a little look at Mr.\r\n    Garton’s paper,[100] which I am sure must contain a deal of\r\n    solidly valuable information, I have laid it aside to wait your\r\n    helpful guidance. I have a letter just now from Dr. Fream saying\r\n    he would like very much to come to meet you (as I begged him),\r\n    but cannot manage it. I am looking forward exceedingly to much\r\n    useful and pleasant talk. I generally go to church at St.\r\n    Michael’s (where Lord Bacon is buried) in the morning, but there\r\n    is much good music at the Abbey close by, and you would do\r\n    everything I hope just exactly as you like best.

Encouraged by the gratifying manner in which her academic\r\ndistinction had been acknowledged by friends and public bodies, Miss\r\nOrmerod began with renewed vigour, and with something almost akin to\r\nprophetic instinct of what was to come in the not-far-distant future, to\r\nproduce and to arrange for the production of, the literature that was\r\nneeded to complete her life-work and to be a record of it. Another\r\nconspicuous feature of this chapter is the practical means she adopted\r\nto immediately show gratitude to the University for the perspicacity\r\nshown by conferring its degree, which was treasured by her above all\r\nthings as the highest possible recognition of her scientific labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _To Professor Robert Wallace, University Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 29, 1900._\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—I have been reading parts of the\r\n    “advance” proof of your paper [to be read before the London\r\n    Farmers’ Club in April, 1900], and it seems to me capital, and\r\n    to meet the needs plainly and practically. I wish you much\r\n    success. I can speak from personal knowledge as to want of\r\n    dipping being excellent for increase of _Melophagus ovinus_ [so\r\n    called sheep tick] (fig. 25).\r\n\r\n    Mr. Druce [Secretary of the Club], writes me kindly that he\r\n    intends to propose a vote of congratulation to me to-morrow on\r\n    the honour conferred on me by the Edinburgh University, and this\r\n    would be a great pleasure to me, for I feel it a very great\r\n    honour indeed. From many good quarters I am receiving letters on\r\n    this point, also on the benefit to agriculture which the\r\n    approval of Edinburgh will give.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 30, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am arranging with Elliott and Fry, the photographers, 55,\r\n    Baker Street, that they should send down a “representative” on\r\n    Monday with proofs of photos, the bearer to be here by train\r\n    arriving at about half-past ten a.m. But the truth is, that if\r\n    you think I might ask acceptance, just as their first Hon. Lady\r\n    LL.D., I should very much like to offer to the University one of\r\n    Elliott and Fry’s life-size chalk or oil portraits executed in\r\n    their best way as a remembrance of the 14th of April. Do you\r\n    think I might?\r\n\r\n    I am glad to know they spoke kindly of me at the Farmers’ Club.\r\n    I am sure I have some good friends there, and I thought it very\r\n    kind of them to send me their vote of congratulation on my great\r\n    honour.\r\n\r\n    [The London Farmers’ Club, at its April meeting, 1900, passed\r\n    with acclamation the following resolution:—“That the hearty\r\n    congratulations of the Club are hereby offered to its Honorary\r\n    Lady Member, Miss Eleanor A. Ormerod, upon the distinguished\r\n    dignity of LL.D. recently conferred upon her _honoris causa_ by\r\n    the University of Edinburgh.” A copy of the resolution was\r\n    transmitted by the Secretary to the Senatus of the University of\r\n    Edinburgh.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 11, 1900._\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—I had the books very carefully packed\r\n    and sent off to-day, by luggage train, as they made rather a\r\n    heavy consignment. [Volumes of her father’s drawings, and copies\r\n    of the “Manual of Injurious Insects” for free distribution.]\r\n\r\n    You will see I put a little note into the copies of the Manual,\r\n    at “Red Spider,” just in some degree to bring the matter of\r\n    position of the spinning glands up to date; I do not know of any\r\n    other point that needs correcting.\r\n\r\n    I enjoyed your visit exceedingly, and not only that, but you\r\n    would hardly believe what a great amount of useful information\r\n    you conveyed to me in the course of our conversations, as to\r\n    many matters at Edinburgh. All these I have carefully noted, for\r\n    though I do not really hold any post among you, yet I like to\r\n    think myself now not wholly separate, and I should be entirely\r\n    thankful should need occur at any time to avail myself of your\r\n    permission to apply to you for advice. My friends greatly\r\n    enjoyed all you said at lunch, and I shall hope you will come\r\n    again presently.\r\n\r\n    I have written to Sir Wm. Muir about my father’s books of\r\n    sketches, but in real truth I feel such a fear of intruding on\r\n    his high official position that I only just said what I thought\r\n    was quite needed, but I entered a little more on the matter to\r\n    Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXVIII.\r\n  ORMEROD HOUSE, LANCASHIRE.\r\n  _From an outline sketch by George Ormerod, 1808_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Librarian wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH,\r\n                                                     _May 16, 1900._\r\n\r\n    DEAR MADAM,—I really do not know how to thank you for the honour\r\n    you have done our University Library by making it the custodian\r\n    in _perpetuitatem_ of the delightful collection of sketches and\r\n    water colours, the arrival of which has made the 15th of May a\r\n    red-letter day for the Librarian at least. You will, I hope, be\r\n    pleased to know that the priceless volumes have been placed in a\r\n    room already rendered a sanctum by relics of such notable names\r\n    as Shakespeare and Burns, Hus and Knox, Queen Mary of Scotland,\r\n    King James VI., Queen Elizabeth, &c., not to mention\r\n    Halliwell-Phillipps and David Laing, both of whom, I doubt not,\r\n    Dr. George Ormerod would have recognised as his colleagues and\r\n    peers. Professor Wallace has duly received his volumes. The\r\n    drawings have been shown to Sir William Muir, who, I believe, is\r\n    to thank you personally and who will lay them on the table at\r\n    the next meeting of the University Court.\r\n\r\n                                                      H.

And I was\r\n    asked to communicate their obligations to you for them. They\r\n    will be placed in the Library, and will be remembered as the\r\n    gift of our First Lady Graduate, LL.D.\r\n\r\n                                                            W. MUIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 24, 1900._\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—Will you kindly accept the enclosed\r\n    photograph. It does not seem to be quite me, but “me” does not\r\n    quite know myself yet in cap and gown. At least it may remind\r\n    you sometimes of most hearty gratitude for all your kind care\r\n    which enabled me to come to personally receive the great honour\r\n    symbolised.\r\n\r\n    Dr. MacDougall was good enough to send me some splendid\r\n    specimens of bark infested by _Hylesinus crenatus_ (Greater\r\n    ash-bark beetle), which have enabled me to figure this attack. I\r\n    should like very much indeed to form a “Handbook of Insects\r\n    Injurious to Forest Trees,” and I have a mass of material in my\r\n    Annual Reports bringing the subject, I think, up to date, and a\r\n    beautiful supply of figures, but there is such a run of\r\n    application and correspondence that I do not see my way to doing\r\n    it myself—and yet it seems a pity for the information to be\r\n    lying comparatively idle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 29, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Now I must say that you wrote exactly what I was wishing about\r\n    my proposed book, “Insects Injurious to Forest Trees.”[101] In\r\n    case Dr. MacDougall would not think me taking a liberty in\r\n    suggesting the plan, I should very much indeed like to have the\r\n    benefit of his skilled help in preparing the book, that is\r\n    bringing it out in collaboration with him, and with our names on\r\n    the title-page. Would you kindly take the trouble when you see\r\n    him to lay the matter before him, for I scarcely like to come\r\n    upon him suddenly without, so to say, a “sponsor.” My idea is\r\n    that the forest attacks would work out much like the papers in\r\n    my “Handbook,” of which of course I would gladly send a copy for\r\n    his acceptance as well as material, _i.e._, Annual Reports or\r\n    sometimes, if more convenient, extracted papers and a copy of\r\n    “General Index.” I would undertake all expenses, _i.e._,\r\n    printing, publishing, furnishing figures, and the like. I think\r\n    I have of my own nearly as many of good up-to-date illustrations\r\n    as we should need to illustrate every attack, but where\r\n    additions are needed I propose (as I am doing now from one of\r\n    Dr. MacDougall’s specimens) to have them figured from life by\r\n    Mr. Knight.[102] I fancy the book would be about twothirds as\r\n    long as my “Handbook of Orchard Fruits,” but being intended at\r\n    first for University services, possibly the plan would be\r\n    different. This he, you, and possibly Colonel Bailey [lecturer\r\n    on Forestry in Edinburgh University] might have a word to say\r\n    about. I should like very much to hear from you on the subject,\r\n    and perhaps from Dr. MacDougall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _June 5, 1900._\r\n\r\n    You will tell me presently when you can come, but would not Mr.\r\n    John Garton [of Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, the originator of\r\n    the scientific system of producing new breeds of crop plants by\r\n    multiple-crossing] come too? I should like it very much if it\r\n    were agreeable to him, as there are so many points of interest\r\n    we three could go over together. You could assure him that he\r\n    can be as quiet as ever he likes, and rest in his own room, just\r\n    as he pleases. Will you both come on Saturday for Sunday? When\r\n    you come we can have a good talk about the “Forestry Insect Text\r\n    Book.” I am very glad to have it from you that Dr. MacDougall\r\n    likes the idea of colleagueship. I have had a very nice letter\r\n    from him with promise of one of details to follow, but when I\r\n    found that he had been collecting notes for some years, I felt\r\n    so very uneasy lest he should think me intruding on his projects\r\n    (in fact very presumptuous) that I wrote him specially on this\r\n    head. I shall be delighted to put every morsel of observations,\r\n    and blocks, and all I can to help at his service, but it is to\r\n    his skill that I look to form the book into what he knows, much\r\n    better than I, will suit University needs.\r\n\r\n    The weather surely needs a little putting to rights. It caught\r\n    me rather sharply, and I have had to spend some days in bed, but\r\n    I am up again now, and getting some good observations.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—I have some such nice letters from Edinburgh about my\r\n    photo. A very charming one from Sir Ludovic Grant, also from\r\n    Professor Seth.[103] I mean to keep them as great treasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _June 14, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am in receipt of a long letter from Dr. MacDougall about the\r\n    text-book of “Forest Insects,” and it seems to me that his plan\r\n    is excellent. For my good folks, who want the plainest facts\r\n    fairly driven into their heads in the very plainest words, I\r\n    think it would be too scientific in the possession of special\r\n    entomological chapters, but I quite think in the present case\r\n    these are needed, and my only fear is lest he should wish me to\r\n    collaborate in these. All the rest I think I should be quite at\r\n    home in, and I am going to write him about it, as I should very\r\n    much like the joint work.\r\n\r\n    I am writing down bits (long or short as they come into my head)\r\n    of “Recollections,” on pages with appropriate headings in my\r\n    letter book, which usually lies on the table most of the day, so\r\n    is at hand; and most miscellaneous reminiscences go in which I\r\n    feel sure I should not have courage to think of giving excepting\r\n    on our plan. I rather think they might be interesting, and I\r\n    mean to see in good time about the shorthand writer. The head\r\n    reporter of our best local paper can take down well a report\r\n    from my dictation. Do not you think that if we can get the\r\n    “Recollections” (how would “Recollections of Changing Times” do\r\n    for a title?) into shape that—instead of publishing as I usually\r\n    do with any amount of trouble and little return for the\r\n    expense—it would be a good plan to offer the MS. to some\r\n    publisher, who might, I think, take it off my hands on terms to\r\n    be agreed upon? But when next we meet I hope we shall go into\r\n    all these matters comfortably, as you say, “after dinner.”\r\n\r\n    P.S.—The French medal (plate XXII.) appeared to-day in a\r\n    registered letter. I wonder whether Professor Ewart has got his?\r\n    I have information of the worst attacks of eel-worms in broad\r\n    beans that I ever saw, after oats in the spring of 1898 and of\r\n    1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _July 18, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I feel sure, wherever you are, that you are so much occupied\r\n    that you have not a morsel of spare time, but if you could\r\n    presently give me a little advice it would be of great value to\r\n    me. I was urged to let my name be put on the Agricultural\r\n    Education Committee, and agreed, and by way of something solid I\r\n    suggested that I should form a set of papers on “Common Fly\r\n    attacks to Farm Stock,” and I set to work. But as I go on I\r\n    really think that they are more fitted for regular agricultural\r\n    work, and I should value a few words of guidance from you very\r\n    much. The subjects I am thinking of taking as what I know\r\n    personally are: Sheep—Nostril fly, with note of “Gad” as\r\n    different, and “Spider” fly; Horse—Bot fly, Forest fly;\r\n    Cattle—Warbles, Gad fly, and anything else that might occur.\r\n\r\n    Nostril fly and Horse Bot fly shape (as I think you also would\r\n    consider) nicely, brought up to date; and in _G. equi_ (Horse\r\n    Bot fly, fig. 10) I have really handled the only bit of the\r\n    subject that was not pleasant, so that I do not think anybody\r\n    could object. The two above-mentioned papers are about ready for\r\n    press. But what I wish very much is that you would kindly let me\r\n    know your view of it. Would it be better to print the subjects\r\n    in my usual way, as leaflets, or make them into a little\r\n    pamphlet? _G. equi_ would fit nicely into a four-page leaflet.\r\n    _œ. ovis_, (Sheep Nostril fly), I think would be shorter; and\r\n    the short papers which would go nicely along with their more\r\n    important brethren in a pamphlet rather puzzle me how to deal\r\n    with if in leaflets. I have excellent figures, and in an idea\r\n    (possibly erroneous) of bringing the sequence out for the\r\n    Agricultural Education Committee, I wrote a sort of little\r\n    “fresh” preface on the creatures collectively. As I am sure you\r\n    will allow me the pleasure of thinking myself in some degree a\r\n    colleague of yours (and if I drive well at work I should hope to\r\n    have it ready for your winter session), I should be exceedingly\r\n    obliged if you would tell me whether you think pamphlet or\r\n    leaflet would be best. [The pamphlet form was ultimately\r\n    adopted, and it was published as “Flies Injurious to Stock,”\r\n    &c., price sixpence.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1, Fly, magnified, line showing natural length; 2, maggot; 3, mouth\r\n    hooks of maggot; and 4, tail segment, showing spiracles, and lobes,\r\n    acting as organs of progression—all magnified.

When I have got the\r\n    first sheet of “Flies Injurious to Stock,” I should like to send\r\n    one to you, please; not to trouble you, but just that you may\r\n    see how it is getting on.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  _August 25, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Mr. Elliott tells me that “the oil painting” is to be quite\r\n    ready on (or about) the fourteenth September, and I have ordered\r\n    one of their best “rich” gilt frames in which it is to come down\r\n    here. I hope much that I may somehow or other, be able either\r\n    before completion or here, to secure the saving of anxiety to my\r\n    mind by your seeing it. But I have not as yet written to submit\r\n    my suggestion of acceptance to Dr. Taylor, for may be I had\r\n    better see what I look like first.\r\n\r\n    Enclosed are two sheets of my progressing little pamphlet.\r\n    Please do not trouble yourself by reading them, but, if at any\r\n    time you care to glance over them, I hope you will like them. I\r\n    had no idea till I set regularly to work what need there was of\r\n    bringing the matters up-to-date. I think the brochure seems\r\n    likely to run to about three and a half sheets, with Index. When\r\n    you come you shall tell me, please, whether you will let me\r\n    offer some for your class. I should very much like to—and you\r\n    will tell me too, about Manuals.[104]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _September 4, 1900._\r\n\r\n    It was a great pleasure to me to receive both your letters, but\r\n    I was afraid of intruding too much on your time, so I put off\r\n    thanking you for them till I received the enclosed proof this\r\n    morning. It is a real comfort to me that you can approve of my\r\n    little pamphlet, for I have been very anxious over it, and I\r\n    hope you will think sheet “D” right. I am delighted to be\r\n    allowed to send it to you.\r\n\r\n    At page 33 you will see I have utilised the colouring of\r\n    the eyes of the _Tabanidæ_ (Gad flies), specially for\r\n    identification. I do not think this point is much brought\r\n    forward, and I found it very useful. Many thanks for your\r\n    two pamphlets and suggestion _re_ dips. I have been\r\n    studying your S.S.,[105] and mean to try to get a little\r\n    bit into my paper as an addendum. Also I want to study\r\n    your “Nature Knowledge” [opening lecture to a class of\r\n    teachers.] I don’t seem to understand this subject yet,\r\n    and your address, I feel sure, will help me very much.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday I had a long letter from Mr. E. P. Stebbing,\r\n    Chittagong, Bengal, accompanying a large pamphlet on “Injurious\r\n    Insects of Indian Forests,” published by the Indian Government.\r\n    He wrote that he was taking up the subject of Injurious Insects\r\n    (agricultural as well as forest), and that the Indian Government\r\n    having “put him on special duties for two years to tackle the\r\n    question,” he wanted me to advise him on a number of points. I\r\n    am sure I do not feel competent. However, I wrote him as well as\r\n    I could, and had to look up the shorthand writer we have talked\r\n    about, and get him to put it in typewritten form—so I helped\r\n    myself, at least. When I get the copies I propose just to put\r\n    one in an envelope for you to see what I have been suggesting.\r\n    But I only send it because you are so very importantly engaged\r\n    in Indian, &c., work. I should like you to be able to look at\r\n    it, if you like, but only if you like. Pray put it in the\r\n    rubbish basket if it is the least trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 25, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Here is “Prevention and Remedies,” and the other odds and ends\r\n    for “Stock Flies.”\r\n\r\n    “The picture” has come, and I think that as Mr. Elliott said, it\r\n    is really a “great success.” I hardly know how to comment on my\r\n    own appearance, but if you should be writing to Dr. MacDougall\r\n    he would tell you about it. I almost think I shall be glad when\r\n    it goes on, it is such a curious feeling to have my own eyes\r\n    looking at me so steadily. I suppose when we get into the next\r\n    month I may write in form to Dr. Taylor, to inquire if I may be\r\n    permitted to ask acceptance.\r\n\r\n    I very much enjoyed Dr. MacDougall’s visit. We talked Entomology\r\n    most pleasantly, and I think arranged very satisfactorily all\r\n    necessary preliminaries for our proposed Forest Insect book. The\r\n    little visits which have been given me this summer have helped\r\n    me very much, as well as being a great enjoyment—though none so\r\n    much as yours—and it is a fact, as you mention, that if the\r\n    ladies come too, it perplexes the talk very much! I want to\r\n    learn all I can in the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               _September 27, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I was very much surprised yesterday to receive about six dozen\r\n    large Plant bugs,[106] with a communication from the Chinese\r\n    Minister Plenipotentiary (in London), over his own signature,\r\n    begging for information as to how to prevent their ravages in\r\n    the lee-chee orchards in China. It seems very odd (in the\r\n    present state of affairs especially) that the Chinese Government\r\n    should consult me.[107] However, the treatment wanted was plain,\r\n    so I hope I did not do wrong in replying as he wished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 16, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Lord Grimthorpe is very much interested about your Indian Famine\r\n    lecture, and he would very much like to have a copy.[108] I\r\n    think he will do what he can to study it, likewise expect me to\r\n    give him so much as I can; not much this, I am afraid.\r\n\r\n    I assure you your little visit was a great pleasure to me. These\r\n    excellent talks freshen me up delightfully for dry work. I shall\r\n    look forward to some more in due time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 21, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I do not know how to thank you for this kind gift.[109] I know\r\n    how to value such a literary treasure, and to me it is of\r\n    exceeding interest also; but as your gift to me I treasure it\r\n    much, and gratefully thank you for your kind thought. The twelve\r\n    copies of “Indian Famine” preceded it an hour or two yesterday\r\n    afternoon, and I am reading it carefully and slowly (that I may\r\n    thoroughly appreciate it), and with great admiration; indeed, I\r\n    think such a clear condensation of the mass of information to be\r\n    dealt with is splendid. I have sent copies to Lord Grimthorpe,\r\n    the Bishop of St. Albans, &c.\r\n\r\n    With my very kind regards and grateful thanks for all the help\r\n    you give me, which is a great deal more than probably you have\r\n    any idea of.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 26, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I am delighted to read both the letters you send, but what an\r\n    especial pleasure it must be to you to have the nice courteous\r\n    message of acceptance sent by our good Queen. [In acknowledgment\r\n    of a copy of the address on “Famine in India.”] I congratulate\r\n    you exceedingly. How much you must treasure it! Thank you very\r\n    much for letting me see it, and also that from the Chancellor\r\n    [of the University, the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour].\r\n\r\n    My people have been much pleased to receive the copies you\r\n    kindly let me give them, and Dr. Lipscomb has asked me to thank\r\n    you for him. But I do not know that any one has been more\r\n    interested than Mr. T. P. Newman. He, as one of the “Friends,”\r\n    has been working in their society to help, and I find they\r\n    collected £27,000. [The Friends’ Foreign Mission Association\r\n    collected this sum to use in relief of the famine of 1900].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _October 29, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I have, with much pleasure, written to Messrs. West, Newman &\r\n    Co., to send you (to University, Edinburgh) one hundred copies\r\n    of each of the two pamphlets. Please write when some more (or\r\n    Manuals) would be at all acceptable.\r\n\r\n    I am placing your Famine pamphlet carefully, so I have some\r\n    still on hand, but I will not fail to ask you if more could go\r\n    out well, _viâ_ my presentation. I have been studying it to the\r\n    best of my power. I am not able to condense such a mass of\r\n    information fully, but this is what I think I have learnt. These\r\n    famines originate meteorologically, the crops consequently\r\n    failing for want of moisture. The only places (three districts\r\n    if I remember rightly) exempt from them, are so, consequent on\r\n    climatic circumstances or irrigation. The chief preventive\r\n    measure, being irrigation, is not always easy of application,\r\n    as, for instance, the possibility of a canal raising the height\r\n    of the water-table too much. I follow to some degree the\r\n    difficulty of bringing relief arrangements to bear on special\r\n    bodies of men, as the weavers, for instance. It is also very\r\n    interesting to read of the method of dealing with the “Wild\r\n    Tribes,” their power of finding wild food, and of bringing in\r\n    wild forest products adapted for sale. Some information as to\r\n    details of kinds of food and preparation, also of the sums of\r\n    money represented by Indian names, must surely remain adherent\r\n    to one’s mind, but one special thing is the splendidly arranged\r\n    work of our Government, which is a comfort to think of. I\r\n    inflict the above on you, that you may see I have really been\r\n    trying to benefit by your grand work, and I do congratulate you\r\n    on the result of your heavy labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _November 8, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I should be very thankful if you would tell me where Professor\r\n    Jablonowski might safely apply for sulphate of copper at “an\r\n    acceptable price”! I could, I suppose, look him up some sort of\r\n    an address, but I should not feel sure it was trustworthy, and\r\n    he is such a centre of work, also an old correspondent, I should\r\n    much like to help. I should be very much obliged if you could\r\n    conveniently tell me, or him—he is director of the Government\r\n    Entomological Station, Budapest—where he could get a price list\r\n    and a supply.\r\n\r\n    I have been ailing with some sort of slight feverish and gout\r\n    attack, but nothing serious, and I am up again.\r\n\r\n    To-day Mr. Newstead is come to see what the experimental black\r\n    currants are doing [in the garden]. I gather that even soaking\r\n    the cut-down plants, roots and all, in methylated spirit has not\r\n    proved a wholly certain means of prevention of Gall mite (fig.\r\n    65). If so, I incline to think that I had best make an end of my\r\n    black currant hospital, there is no use in simply bringing in\r\n    infestation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _November 9, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I shall be delighted to see you at next week’s end, Saturday to\r\n    Monday, 17th to 19th, as you mention. Many thanks to you for\r\n    helping me to an answer to the Budapest professor about the\r\n    sulphate of copper. I fancy “the picture” would arrive this\r\n    morning at the University. I hope it will give satisfaction, and\r\n    I make no doubt that it will have great honour done to it in the\r\n    hanging. Perhaps some day I may see it!\r\n\r\n    “Reminiscences” had not been getting on, on paper, but when your\r\n    letter arrived I took up a pen and wrote like a very whirlwind\r\n    some points that were in my mind regarding the beginning of my\r\n    insect studies. I wonder what you will think of them. I hope to\r\n    have some progress to show you. I am having twenty feet\r\n    accommodation for books put up in my dining-room. I think this\r\n    will look well and be very convenient.\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Professor Taylor, Secretary of the University Court, wrote:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 10, 1900._\r\n\r\n    DEAR MISS ORMEROD,—The portrait has arrived uninjured. It is an\r\n    excellent likeness, and with gown, hood and cap, vividly recalls\r\n    what is in reality an event of historical importance as well as\r\n    a most interesting graduation ceremonial. I propose to have it\r\n    placed so that it may be on view, so to speak, to the members of\r\n    the University Court on Monday at their meeting of that day, and\r\n    to the members of the Senatus Academicus when they next meet.\r\n    Thereafter it will no doubt find a permanent place on our walls.\r\n\r\n    I would venture to tender anew the thanks and best wishes of the\r\n    University Court, and with the assurance of my profound esteem,\r\n    beg to remain, dear Miss Ormerod,\r\n\r\n                                                    Sincerely yours,\r\n                                                       M. C.

I really do not know how to express\r\n    what I feel about all the kindness shown me, but you, knowing\r\n    how I have been situated till the University of Edinburgh showed\r\n    me such honour and kindness, will believe the heartfelt comfort\r\n    and encouragement it is to me to have their authoritative\r\n    approval and support. But this is private to you. “The\r\n    Chancellor” and Secretary might think I was _tête montée_ if I\r\n    wrote in such a fashion. I have had some nice letters, two from\r\n    Dr. Taylor and a charming little letter last evening,\r\n    delightfully worded, from Sir Wm. Muir. I am going to look at\r\n    the picture of Lord Inglis again in your beautiful book (“Quasi\r\n    Cursores”), that I may see whom I am allowed to sit next to in\r\n    this very distinguished company, but I am writing to catch the\r\n    post now, so I only thank you also for the papers which I have\r\n    not yet had time to give my head to. With most kind regards and\r\n    hearty thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _November 15, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I feel I gave a very insufficient acknowledgment (writing in a\r\n    hurry last night) for all the kind care and, I feel sure, no\r\n    small trouble you have been taking about putting my\r\n    “representation” nicely on view. I have refreshed my memory of\r\n    Lord Inglis, and indeed I feel I have a right to be proud that\r\n    my portrait is allowed to be placed by such a grand\r\n    representation of such a distinguished man. I am glad the\r\n    “Court” liked the picture in itself (I urged all concerned to\r\n    good execution), and indeed it is a pleasure to me to think that\r\n    the memory of endeavours at least to work of E. A. O. will be so\r\n    markedly protected by the University.\r\n\r\n                                               Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                                 ELEANOR A. ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—My new arrangement of books is so convenient, it helps me\r\n    almost as much as an assistant! (E. A.

The pages are replete with\r\nhuman nature and human sympathy, and full of unselfish interest in the\r\ninterests of others whom she numbered among her sympathetic friends and\r\ntrusted confidants. The “Reminiscences” on which she did but desultory,\r\nyet interested, work, during the intervals of temporary respite from the\r\nburden of disease and increasing physical exhaustion, were as she\r\nfeelingly expressed it “a perfect blessing.” Her letters belonging to\r\nthis period are a noble record of fortitude and resignation during a\r\ntrying struggle for health and life, and the close is touchingly\r\npathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _To Professor Robert Wallace, University, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                _November 19, 1900_, Monday evening.\r\n\r\n    DEAR PROFESSOR WALLACE,—I return Sir W. Macgregor’s letter[110]\r\n    with many thanks for letting me see it, for it is very\r\n    gratifying. It is a great pleasure to me to see how those who\r\n    understand appreciate your work. I am very glad you are able to\r\n    tell me that you enjoy your visits to me, but next time I hope\r\n    that our going to church may be of a less airy sort. I hope that\r\n    you did not get serious harm?[111]\r\n\r\n    I feel much pleasure (not to say relief) at results of our\r\n    “Reminiscence” work, and at all those papers being safely lodged\r\n    in your hands.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—I am working steadily on the twenty-fourth Report, but if a\r\n    bit [of “Reminiscences”] comes into my head (the “awen,” as the\r\n    Welsh say), I mean to put down the ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _December 5, 1900._\r\n\r\n    Here comes such a long story [here cut short] about the\r\n    “Reminiscences.” I hope it will not be quite too tedious, but\r\n    really I think we are thriving.\r\n\r\n    A messenger has just been down from London, and carried off\r\n    material for ten illustrations.\r\n\r\n    The materials for letterpress are appearing fairly out of holes\r\n    and corners also, the chief prize a book of Memoranda for 1891,\r\n    by my sister Georgiana, giving numbers of dates of my letters,\r\n    &c.\r\n\r\n    I was glad to see the “Creameries”[112] in the “Times,” and glad\r\n    to see also that it was properly placed at the top of the\r\n    column. I thought you wrote very firmly and well.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—I have not sent [copies of the Manual] (though you kindly\r\n    said I might) to the Clubs. I have not the courage; so many of\r\n    the members might not care for Economic Entomology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 15, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I think I am being very good! in seldom letting the\r\n    “Reminiscences” meddle really with work, but rest time (wet\r\n    afternoons) helps. One thing more, I remembered I had a part\r\n    given me by my mother of my father’s “queue” (Anglice,\r\n    “pigtail”) cut off in the year of their marriage, 1808, and I\r\n    think this might come in nicely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _December 21, 1900._\r\n\r\n    I quite forgot to thank you for your Indian Examination\r\n    questions,[113] which was wrong of me, for I like very much to\r\n    have all the information they point to, though I am afraid there\r\n    are scarcely two I could answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _January 18, 1901._\r\n\r\n    My account of myself is—I am fairly well all but rheumatism;\r\n    only, last Saturday the disaster happened of a blood-vessel\r\n    breaking in my left eye. These affairs seem seldom of\r\n    consequence, but this time my doctor told me (after two or three\r\n    days) that he did not remember excepting from external\r\n    circumstances that he ever knew such a great breakage. So I was\r\n    an absolute spectacle for some time, but the sight is not at all\r\n    injured, and the organ recovering well, and I may write as much\r\n    as I like. I now enclose six more illustrations—I think in their\r\n    way they are all nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _January 27, 1901._\r\n\r\n    As you kindly say that even more than a good report of\r\n    “Reminiscences” you would like to hear I am better, I am truly\r\n    thankful to say that I am quite as usual again, and my eye\r\n    recovered. There has been some sort of illness about but I had\r\n    it very lightly. I hope the very bad day for His Majesty’s\r\n    Proclamation brought no serious harm to yourself. An Edinburgh\r\n    “inquirer” informed me that he thought numbers of the spectators\r\n    would catch their deaths of cold. I was truly pleased to see\r\n    that the King duly promised to support “The Church of Scotland,”\r\n    a matter I have more at heart than on my tongue here! You will\r\n    value Her Majesty’s approval of your “Indian Famine” lecture\r\n    more than ever now. I certainly should have liked myself to have\r\n    a tiny bit even of approval.\r\n\r\n    “Reminiscences.”—This is just for your best leisure (and\r\n    pleasure) to advise me on, but I very much need a good “paper\r\n    talk” with you to start me on a reasonable plan. I quite believe\r\n    that in a fortnight or sooner I may begin regularly.\r\n\r\n    But now—publisher! Messrs. A— B— wrote me that the book would be\r\n    so sound it would be sure to command public approval and they\r\n    would like to publish. Mr. Newman wrote he thought I had best go\r\n    to the top of the tree, and suggested John Murray. I answered\r\n    that in real truth the very idea of applying to such a leading\r\n    man made me quite uneasy—and yesterday he replied that as he\r\n    understood you were aiding me in the work, that my best course\r\n    would be to ask you whether when the time comes you would act on\r\n    my part with a publisher. I am sure he is right—I am as ignorant\r\n    as a reasonable person can be of how to “approach” a publisher,\r\n    but, if I am not asking too much, it would indeed be a relief to\r\n    my mind if you think fit to give me this help.\r\n\r\n    If it is possible I certainly should much like to print with\r\n    Messrs. West, Newman & Co. Is it possible to have a part of the\r\n    book printed before beginning negotiations just to show what it\r\n    is like?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _February 4, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I feel sure you will be pleased to hear that this morning I sent\r\n    Messrs. West, Newman & Co. all that I believe is needed for my\r\n    present Annual Report, excepting for completion of Index; and I\r\n    have really begun “Reminiscences.” Will not my best way be to\r\n    take any subjects that I think I have enough material for, and\r\n    work them up just as I think they might go to press? Thus you\r\n    would see how you like the writing and suggest improvements, and\r\n    there would be something, if you please, to show a publisher.\r\n    Turning to your letter—I think that if at your very best leisure\r\n    you would kindly let me have the parcel of MS. which you were\r\n    good enough to take for safe custody it would help me now.\r\n\r\n    How dreary the past week has been with our national sorrow and\r\n    all the anxieties. I hope we may be more cheerful now.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 _February 8, 1901._\r\n\r\n    Your beautifully secured parcel has arrived safely, and I have\r\n    locked it up carefully in my safe, with a very legible\r\n    inscription that the contents are the property of Prof. Wallace,\r\n    University of Edinburgh. There is nothing like making sure, in\r\n    case of as people say “anything happening”! I should like to\r\n    think that this mass of documents which I have been accumulating\r\n    should pass to your hands.\r\n\r\n    I hope the work for your lecture[114] on the twelfth prox. is\r\n    getting on quite to your liking. It is always a great pleasure\r\n    to me to hear your plans are prospering.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 14, 1901._\r\n\r\n    It has been very much on my conscience that I did not say a word\r\n    in my hasty letter about your beautiful and valuable\r\n    present.[115] How very pretty it must be, and a very great\r\n    pleasure to yourself as a kindly acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n    About the “Reminiscences”—what you suggest about typewriting is\r\n    just what I should like, but I did not care to trust MS. here.\r\n    Before parleying with the typewriters, I should like very much\r\n    indeed to read to you all the papers that I can get ready before\r\n    the ninth. I feel a little anxious about the new style of\r\n    writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 21, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I have made up a good bit on “birth, childhood, and parentage”\r\n    (chap. I.) not forgetting with “an action of humility”! Edward\r\n    I., and Eleanor of Castille. At present I have “Series of Annual\r\n    Reports” (chap. IX.) on hand,—very pleasant work.\r\n\r\n    But now I want you, please (and very much indeed), to be kindly\r\n    thinking of some advice about my entomological work that I am\r\n    sure you could help me greatly with when we meet. The burthen\r\n    has become so very great that it seriously affects my health. I\r\n    am in bed now with another of these attacks; the constant\r\n    pressure of work to suit other people’s time and convenience,\r\n    and maybe a tremendous worry, brings on painful and exhausting\r\n    illness. I hope to be up again to-day, but the doctor is very\r\n    anxious I should—may I call it?—“Take in sail.” My wish is that\r\n    the present Annual Report should be the last of the series with\r\n    an addendum slip of explanation inserted. There is not the\r\n    important information needed or forwarded that there was twenty\r\n    years ago, and working hard for months over so much repetition\r\n    is dreadful drudgery. I heard lately from Dr. Fream, and he very\r\n    strongly advises me to drop it. If your opinion—which I\r\n    thoroughly trust—is the same, I should have no doubt. The\r\n    difficult thing is to moderate the applications, but I think I\r\n    see my way to that very nicely by having plenty of the addendum\r\n    slip printed and sending a copy to an unreasonable applicant. I\r\n    do not want to give up Entomology entirely.\r\n\r\n    How nice it must have been to have a good turn at curling!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                _February 24, 1901._\r\n\r\n    In answer to your very kind letter I must tell you I am much\r\n    better. It was quite my fault that I got so out of sorts; I\r\n    ought to have asked my doctor weeks ago what was amiss, and then\r\n    the difficulty of how I, “all of my own head,” was to get that\r\n    “old man of the sea”—the Annual Reports—off my shoulders, came\r\n    on me like a brain shock. However, now I hope things are getting\r\n    quite nicely into order again. Meanwhile I am trying to arrange\r\n    what can hardly fail to be a rather explosive announcement. When\r\n    I came to set to work it did not seem to me that an addendum\r\n    slip would do. It would have been on such different lines to the\r\n    statements in the Preface that folks would have wondered what\r\n    could have happened! So I mean to have a Cancel, and hope all\r\n    will be nice.\r\n\r\n    One word which I forgot—I quite hope to pass on quietly as much\r\n    Economic Entomology as I possibly can to Dr. MacDougall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 1, 1901._\r\n\r\n    This is very kind of you, and if you are very much shocked at my\r\n    explicitness please consider yourself an extra nephew, M.D. for\r\n    the occasion, and put this in the fire.\r\n\r\n    I have had a kidney attack. I believe something “gouty” (?) has\r\n    been wrong for weeks, but I had not asked the doctor until such\r\n    pain set in that there were no two ways about it, I had to go to\r\n    bed; and he put me on a “course” (of alkalis, I believe) to get\r\n    out the enemy. Of course this was very weakening, but I was soon\r\n    up—and really absolutely, I believe that if it were not for a\r\n    nasty barking cough—very tiresome by day, and more so by night—I\r\n    should be much as usual. I should be grievously disappointed if\r\n    you did not come for any reason connected with me. Speaking very\r\n    selfishly, and besides all the good the pleasure of one of your\r\n    visits does me, I do not feel as if I could settle comfortably\r\n    until I have the benefit of your sound and skilled advice about\r\n    how to rearrange my entomological work.\r\n\r\n    “Reminiscences” are in enough trim to show you something of even\r\n    now.[116]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 2, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I am so sorry regarding what I am writing that I hardly know how\r\n    to put it, but I find to-day I am so much pulled down that I am\r\n    obliged to tell you. It would be a sad disappointment to me if I\r\n    did not see you, but my nights are so bad from this cough that I\r\n    cannot depend on not having to ring to call Miss Hartwell to\r\n    attend to me, and this makes a great commotion. I believe, as I\r\n    wrote you yesterday, that the illness (as well as the pain) has\r\n    gone, but it is the cough which has been keeping me pulled down,\r\n    more than I knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 4, 1901._\r\n\r\n    Indeed, you are quite too kind and good to me, and now I want to\r\n    say that my doctor says he does not see any reason why I should\r\n    not be able to enjoy your visit on Sunday next without any\r\n    difficulty or risk whatsoever. If it was convenient to you,\r\n    would the train suit that would bring you to St. Albans about a\r\n    quarter before 11 from St. Pancras, and could you stop till the\r\n    (I think) 8.30 train? I am truly sorry not to be looking forward\r\n    this week to a whole week-end, but I am still obliged to get up\r\n    and go to bed at unusual hours; but, indeed, I am very much\r\n    better—the pain went, but one of the bad sort of cold or cough\r\n    attacks followed and I could not sleep properly for three nights\r\n    nor rest lying down. Now I can rest and sleep again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _March 7, 1901._\r\n\r\n    Please do not think that a good talk tires me or is any strain.\r\n    It is the want of conversation that I find so wearing, and there\r\n    is so very much that it will be quite a delight and a rest for\r\n    me to be allowed to go over with you.\r\n\r\n    I am writing this to-day so that you may know that (so far as\r\n    anything in this world is certain) there is no possible reason\r\n    why I should not look forward to the pleasure of our meeting\r\n    next Sunday. I am not able to give you my doctor’s verdict for\r\n    the good reason that he did not think I needed looking up\r\n    yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 12, 1901._\r\n\r\n    You do not know how good and kind I think it of you to let me\r\n    rest on you for advice in this way, and it brings a great\r\n    brightness when you come and I can hope you are making yourself\r\n    at home. I am glad you like Mr. Newman. I always feel that he is\r\n    a quite true and well-judging friend, very kindly, but at the\r\n    same time so grave that I do not at all times feel free to\r\n    express all I am thinking about! I fancy that you “not being a\r\n    lady” he would feel freer to express what was uppermost.\r\n\r\n    Thank you for all you say about Mr. John Murray, and very\r\n    especially indeed for your good advice. I do really mean, and am\r\n    trying to act on it, but cannot you imagine the difficulty in\r\n    not working as hard as body and mind will allow?\r\n\r\n    However, I have made a thorough beginning; amongst various\r\n    points, returning to Mr. Newman a great bundle of proofs sent to\r\n    be looked through, just think, unlooked at. I also disposed of a\r\n    regular onslaught with special letters from Lady Warwick and\r\n    Miss Edith Bradley, &c. I am minding what you said [about\r\n    curtailing work] very nicely.\r\n\r\n    I am thankful to say I am feeling better every day, and I am\r\n    looking forward very much to being a better kind of hostess if\r\n    you will kindly spare me a week-end by and by.\r\n\r\n    7 p.m.—You are, I conjecture, just beginning your lecture [on\r\n    “Agriculture in South Africa”]. I hope it will be thoroughly\r\n    pleasant and satisfactory and that you will have a comfortable\r\n    journey home. Please accept the enclosed [the twenty-fourth and\r\n    last Report]. I have only received a parcel late to-day, but I\r\n    want to send you a copy “from the writer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 18, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I am very glad your colonial lecture was successful. It is no\r\n    good my not telling you, for some way or other you would have an\r\n    idea, but I have not been thriving. Of course there was a flood\r\n    of letters about discontinuing the Annual Reports, and, however\r\n    kind (and some were very kind indeed) yet not being in full\r\n    working order, they were rather too much, and I got feverish\r\n    “rigors” (though not bad) with temperature 100°, and the doctor\r\n    on Saturday ordered me straight off to bed. Here I am still, but\r\n    as far as I know, now only as a matter of precaution. I would\r\n    not have said anything about it, but I was sure you would have\r\n    an idea.\r\n\r\n    Now about something much nicer. I wrote to Miss Ashworth (28,\r\n    Victoria Street, London) and had a most pleasant and\r\n    businesslike reply. She told me that publishers preferred quarto\r\n    size and typed a few lines to show the size of type and style\r\n    they like best; and I sent up the “Chartist Outbreak” (chap.\r\n    VII.) and asked her to type it for me accordingly, and to let me\r\n    have one copy and two carbon copies. Thus there would be one for\r\n    you, one for me, and the third would be useful for the\r\n    publisher. I should be very much obliged if you would kindly\r\n    tell me how to offer a copy of my twenty-fourth Report to the\r\n    University Library. Would it be sufficient just to send a copy\r\n    c/o The Librarian. I do not want to give more trouble than I can\r\n    help about such a little thing.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—I assure you I mean to attend to your kind advice of not\r\n    making what might be a great pleasure into a toil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 20, 1901._\r\n\r\n    Here comes the first instalment of “Reminiscences” and I hope to\r\n    forward more to you in due course. The history of “Rise and\r\n    Progress of Annual Reports” is in Miss Ashworth’s hands. Indeed,\r\n    I am very thankful to you for helping me about the typewriting.\r\n    I had no idea of the helpful difference it makes even to me.\r\n    Please, I earnestly beg of you, do not think that your\r\n    delightful and helpful visit, only too short, had anything to do\r\n    with my having to call in the doctor again. I am sure he does\r\n    not. But I am sure, too, you will understand how very trying\r\n    indeed, though mostly very kind, the outbreak of newspaper and\r\n    private comment on what they call “my retirement” was. So to get\r\n    my cough really cured, and drive constitutional coincidences out\r\n    of the field I went to bed with the best possible effects\r\n    (really). I think the doctor will let me get up to-morrow, but\r\n    he wants me to keep safe from snow chills.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 24, 1901._\r\n\r\n    Here is another bit [of autobiography] begging your reading when\r\n    you are inclined, and now “Birth, Parentage, &c.,” is gone up to\r\n    London. I should so very much like (if not too much trouble) if\r\n    you would make some sort of mark on the margin of your copy,\r\n    wherever you think some alteration is needed, and then when I\r\n    have the pleasure of seeing you here we could go comfortably\r\n    into it.\r\n\r\n    Now (as the fates permit) I am working on “The Severn and the\r\n    Wye” (chap. V.), and I think it will be interesting, there is\r\n    such a variety of fresh observation, “Fish, fishers, and\r\n    fisheries,” some specialities in zoology and semi-marine botany,\r\n    and something of a good many sorts of things.\r\n\r\n    I am much mended and doctor says I may tell you I am getting on\r\n    all right, but the long illness has pulled me down very much so\r\n    that I am only allowed at present to be up in my own room—such a\r\n    little thing brings the cough back and we have snow showers\r\n    still—but as soon as ever I can get about again I have no reason\r\n    to doubt I should be much as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _March 29, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I seem very unlucky this winter, but on Tuesday, when I hoped I\r\n    was pretty well again, a chill so bad and so strangely sudden\r\n    seized me, that breathing got hurried, I could not speak with\r\n    comfort, and an acute pain set in in my right side. Doctor set\r\n    to work and did not mention that congestion of the lungs was\r\n    present, but taking affairs at once did great good, and the\r\n    enemy was routed; still, I am a good deal pulled down, and do\r\n    not mean risking another chill at present. I had greatly hoped\r\n    this time not to tell you any long stories about my health, but\r\n    it is no good pretending, so please you must let your friendly\r\n    sympathy in my troubles be my excuse.\r\n\r\n    I wonder what you will think of the enclosed [“copy”]. I incline\r\n    to think the subjects are rather nice, but that as we get on\r\n    bits of this may fit into future papers, or of future papers\r\n    here? It seems to me best to write whatever I can as well as I\r\n    can manage, and sift by and by. “Am not I ’umble” (as Uriah Heap\r\n    says) about Edward I.? (page 13).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 1, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I know I shall always have your kind sympathy in these\r\n    unpleasant visitations, and I wish they did not come to intrude\r\n    so often. But this time I really and truly do hope, unless some\r\n    luckless draught gets hold of me, that I shall pick up quickly,\r\n    and not have such dreary stories to tell you.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Lipscomb says that it is just having let my health run down\r\n    that is the reason, and I mean to be very careful. I am up in my\r\n    room part of the day comfortably, and hope to get downstairs\r\n    to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    I greatly look forward to a good talk by and by over many\r\n    matters, and I was very sorry that Dr. MacDougall could not come\r\n    this week, but further on I hope we shall have a chat. You will\r\n    doubtless (or very likely) have seen flourishes in the papers\r\n    about a testimonial! to my unworthy self—but to my horror\r\n    yesterday I had a letter from Mr. —— stating that he was trying\r\n    to procure a pension for me; and the Member for H—— and (I\r\n    understood Lord ——) would most likely use their influence.\r\n\r\n    Just think what could possess him—what a to-do there would have\r\n    been. But I wrote earnestly representing how misappropriate such\r\n    a grant would be to a person so well off as myself, and it being\r\n    such a troublesome matter, I got Dr. L. to read my letter. I\r\n    hope I may have quite stopped his operations (and politely), but\r\n    assuredly I should feel inexpressibly lowered if I accepted a\r\n    “pension.”\r\n\r\n    I have been collecting for “Reminiscences” very fairly well, but\r\n    I have been afraid to prepare whole papers lest\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 2, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I must write a line to give, I believe, a soundly good report of\r\n    myself in reply to your letter, which arrived 4.50; it is very\r\n    good of you to write so kindly. I have been down to-day for\r\n    about six hours, and I do hope now to steadily regain my\r\n    strength.\r\n\r\n    You will let me have your address, will you not? And I shall\r\n    hope to write something more worth reading.\r\n\r\n    Mr. —— has on my urgent representation stopped his applications\r\n    as to a pension.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—The typewriting seems to me beautiful, and I hope soon to\r\n    have more work ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _April 8, 1901._\r\n\r\n    You will know from your own experience the deluges of\r\n    publications which come—what can I do with them? They might be\r\n    measured by feet, if not by yards. Some valuable, some ——!\r\n\r\n    Would not it be my best way to keep them all until you will, as\r\n    I hope, come some day—and you could see if there are any that\r\n    you would like. Besides what are of no very obvious use, there\r\n    are quantities of amazingly learned entomological treatises\r\n    which, in case they do not float in the way of our good friend\r\n    Dr. MacDougall, he might at least like to place on his shelves.\r\n    You will tell me, will you not, some time what you advise?\r\n    Meanwhile, with all possible good wishes and kind regards, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _April 19, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I should like to give you a better account of myself, but for\r\n    weeks back I could not think why I got on so slowly, with\r\n    “relapses,” and it is only just lately that I have extracted out\r\n    of my good doctor that the illness I had was that horrid\r\n    influenza, and I am going through the weeks and weeks of “after\r\n    effects”! I am not allowed to go down, but sit up a few hours in\r\n    my room, and am certainly better, but I am told I must not\r\n    expect to be well for a long time. One of my doctor nephews\r\n    looked in yesterday, and he told me that a characteristic of\r\n    some of the influenzas which have been about is that they do not\r\n    seem much at the time, but they leave those detestable effects\r\n    on the system.\r\n\r\n    You will believe how very pleasant (as I get stronger) I find\r\n    looking up bits for “Reminiscences.” Miss Hartwell brings me\r\n    books, and I can “rummage” and copy. Now I enclose you some\r\n    pages, of which I think some part is right, but I did not feel\r\n    as if I could put the whole paper right until I had it\r\n    typewritten.\r\n\r\n    I should very much like too if you would give a thought to my\r\n    “Scriptural Commentary” (page 21). I do not see how the\r\n    description I object to can be right. I hope you will think the\r\n    paper is hopeful. I am not up yet, therefore please excuse this\r\n    stupid scrawl, and with my very kind regards and best wishes,\r\n    &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      _May 2, 1901._\r\n\r\n    How I long for the day to come when I may tell you that I am\r\n    well, and am going on as usual. But this disgusting, tenacious\r\n    remains of influenza seems to be always coming back. I had got\r\n    on to coming down on Friday last a little after 9 a.m., and was\r\n    full of hope and absolutely striving to recover, but yesterday\r\n    something went wrong, so I am on a treatment of milk and\r\n    seltzer-water and bed, but I felt I must write you, and hope\r\n    soon to send you a much better letter.\r\n\r\n    “Reminiscences” are a perfect blessing, and I enclose two\r\n    portraits of my father received yesterday to show the\r\n    illustrations are getting on. Is not the one of him as a little\r\n    laddie of about five years old, charming? (plate xxx.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 15, 1901._\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for the additional copy of your lecture,\r\n    “Agriculture in South Africa.” It is so interesting, I am sure I\r\n    can find a home where it will be welcome. I was glad to find you\r\n    were out in the country, and I hope the bracing air will enable\r\n    you to work on this load of papers without killing yourself.\r\n\r\n    For myself, I really am afraid that, excepting hope, I have a\r\n    very indifferent account to give you. I was always getting\r\n    better off and on! But the result was, that I got weaker and\r\n    weaker, until on Saturday Dr. Lipscomb wired for Sir Dyce\r\n    Duckworth. He was away, but my nephew, Dr. J. Arderne Ormerod,\r\n    who is taking Sir D. D.’s practice at present, came down, and I\r\n    think the change of treatment that they arranged is really doing\r\n    good. The trouble was that, though there did not seem any reason\r\n    why, what they call the “after effects” of influenza should not\r\n    move off (the sort of gastric catarrh and its detestable\r\n    allies), yet they didn’t, and my medical tormentors made up\r\n    their minds that it might be from “Liver.” The plan has been\r\n    altered as to treatment, and at my urgent request I am allowed\r\n    to take one glass of port a day, and I do think it is doing me a\r\n    great deal of good. But excuse more now, for sitting up at my\r\n    writing-table tires me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 22, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I am very sorry to tell you in reply to your kind letter that I\r\n    am very ailing. I seem to get fairly well of the influenza, and\r\n    go down and sit for a few hours in the dining-room in the easy\r\n    chair by the fire. Then, as sure as can be, in a very few days I\r\n    get a “recurrence” of illness and have to go to bed for days. I\r\n    think I am now going through about the fifteenth. Dr. Lipscomb\r\n    says he does not know the reason, but it is very like the\r\n    recurrence of Indian fever. I know that there may be scentless\r\n    or other sewer gas, and from what Mr. R—— F—— told me some time\r\n    ago of the recurrence of a very parallel attack to the Duchess\r\n    of C—— from gas under her invalid sofa, I mean to have the\r\n    matter properly seen to. I know there may be reason close to my\r\n    door.\r\n\r\n    P.S.—Since the above was written Dr. Lipscomb has been called\r\n    and thinks the present attack was caused by a chill; and with\r\n    staying in bed a few days Miss Ormerod hopes to be better.—A.\r\n    HARTWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLATE XXX.\r\n  MISS ORMEROD’S FATHER, ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD.\r\n  _From a Miniature of 1790._\r\n  (_p. 323._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MISS ORMEROD IN CHILDHOOD.\r\n  _From a Silhouette, date 1835._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     _May 28, 1901._\r\n\r\n    I am afraid I have seemed very negligent, but my varying illness\r\n    made it very difficult to tell you, and now I do not want to go\r\n    away without telling you my deep gratitude for all the great,\r\n    helpful, affectionate kindness you have showed me.

ORMEROD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The _Times_ of Saturday, July 20, 1901, published an admirable record\r\nof her life and work in the sympathetic obituary notice, from which we\r\nhave made the following brief extract: “We regret to announce the death\r\nof the accomplished entomologist, Miss Eleanor A. Ormerod, which took\r\nplace at her residence, Torrington House, St. Albans, after a severe\r\nillness. She had been gradually sinking for the last six weeks from\r\nmalignant disease of the liver. Her loss is not to this country alone,\r\nbut to the whole civilised world, though the farmers of the United\r\nKingdom will feel in a special degree that a trusted friend has been\r\ntaken from them. Many people will feel that such a magnificent record of\r\nunselfish work as she has left behind ought to have received some\r\nofficial recognition of a national character. Nevertheless, almost the\r\nlast honour bestowed upon her, that of the honorary degree of Doctor of\r\nLaws in the University of Edinburgh, was peculiarly grateful to her,”\r\n&c., &c.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the special interest which Miss Ormerod took in the\r\nprogress of Economic Entomology in Canada and the United States, and the\r\nhigh appreciation in which she was held by the enlightened exponents of\r\nthe subject on the other side of the Atlantic, we conclude with an\r\nextract from the September number of the “Canadian Entomologist” for\r\n1901:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Entomology in England has suffered a great loss through the\r\n    death of this talented and estimable lady, who died at her\r\n    residence, Torrington House, St. Albans, on Friday, July 19th.\r\n    Practical entomologists throughout the world are moved with\r\n    profound regret that a career so remarkable and so useful should\r\n    be brought to a close, but one could hardly hope that the aged\r\n    lady would long be able to sustain the burden of increasing\r\n    infirmities and the trials of a painful and protracted illness.\r\n    Miss Ormerod was one of the most remarkable women of the latter\r\n    half of the nineteenth century, and did more than any one else\r\n    in the British Isles to further the interests of farmers,\r\n    fruitgrowers, and gardeners, by making known to them methods for\r\n    controlling and subduing their multiform insect pests. Her\r\n    labours were unwearied and unselfish; she received no\r\n    remuneration for her services, but cheerfully expended her\r\n    private means in carrying out her investigations and publishing\r\n    their results. We know not now by whom in England this work can\r\n    be continued; it is not likely that any one can follow in the\r\n    unique path laid out by Miss Ormerod; we may therefore cherish\r\n    the hope that the Government of the day will hold out a helping\r\n    hand and establish an entomological bureau for the lasting\r\n    benefit of the great agricultural interests of the country.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n                          APPENDIX A (p. 37).\r\n\r\n_Salmon Fishery_.—Both locally, and thence to the country at large, the\r\nbay beneath the Beachley and the Sedbury Cliffs was very important, as\r\nbeing one centre of the Severn Salmon Fisheries. The following notes by\r\nMr. Frank Buckland,[117] Government Inspector of Salmon Fishing for\r\nEngland and Wales, are interesting: “The visitor will observe in the\r\nlower estuary stretching for a considerable distance into the water from\r\nthe muddy banks, rude piers made entirely of wicker work, which look\r\nlike large eel-baskets; these are called ‘ranks’ of ‘putchers.’ Each\r\nputcher is about 5 ft. 6 in. long, and 21 inches across the mouth. A\r\nframework is made by driving stakes into the mud, and the putchers are\r\nthen fastened together in rows one above the other, often to the height\r\nof 10 feet or more; these great walls of baskets look not unlike, as my\r\nfriend the late John Keast Lord remarked, ‘a gigantic wine rack filled\r\nwith bottles, encased in wicker work.’ As the salmon come along with the\r\ntide in the thick muddy Severn water, they run their noses into the open\r\nmouths of the putchers, and speedily get jammed up at the narrow end;\r\nthe poor things cannot turn, and the more they struggle to get out, the\r\nfirmer they become wedged in; as the tide recedes they are left high and\r\ndry. I have often observed that wasps wait about till the tide goes\r\ndown, and then take first cut at the salmon. A great many first-class\r\nSevern salmon are caught in these putchers and sent to the London\r\nmarket.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to another form of baskets used for catching flat fish, &c.,\r\nat p. 368, he says:—\r\n\r\n“Besides the putchers another kind of basket is used which is called\r\nputts; ... the wicker work is much closer in this instance than in the\r\nother. The putt in its most special form consists of three parts, the\r\nlarge part or mouth, called the ‘putt’; the middle called the ‘butt’;\r\nand the small end or bag, called the ‘firwell.’... The diameter of the\r\nopening is about 5 feet, and the length from 12 to 13 feet; they are\r\nused to catch flat fish, &c.” The illustration (fig. A, page 36), given\r\nby Mr. Buckland shows the putt, with the small end or “firwell” removed.\r\n\r\nThe above technical description of the arrangement, measurement, &c., of\r\nthe “putts” and “putchers,” corresponds in most points with the details\r\nof the long rows (three or four in number) running out into the river\r\nbeneath the Sedbury cliffs (plate X.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          APPENDIX B (p. 67).\r\n\r\nThe following notice appeared in the “Times” of March 11, 1901:—\r\n\r\n         _“Miss Ormerod’s Retirement from Entomological Work.”_\r\n\r\n“Widespread regret will be felt, both at home and abroad, at the\r\nannouncement which we are able to make, that Miss Eleanor A. Ormerod,\r\nafter many years of unremitting toil, has decided to discontinue the\r\nAnnual Reports on injurious insects and common farm pests, which she has\r\nprepared for a period now extending to close upon a quarter of a\r\ncentury. When in the year 1877 she issued the first of these annual\r\nrecords, and thus placed at the disposal of the public the fruits of her\r\nintimate acquaintance with many departments of natural history, very\r\nlittle systematic work had been done in the direction of saving crops\r\nand live stock from the ravages of insect and other pests. In this\r\nrespect the position of the farmer and the stock-keeper to-day, as\r\ncompared with what it was in the middle of the seventies, is vastly\r\nimproved. It is true that the farmer may still lose his turnip and swede\r\ncrops through the ravages of the active little beetle, which is\r\nperversely termed the ‘fly’; that fruit-growers may bewail the loss of\r\ntheir apples and plums owing to the abundant presence of the winter\r\nmoth; and that stock-keepers may view with dismay the damage both direct\r\nand consequential that their cattle incur through the activity of the\r\nwarble fly. But these and similar losses are entirely preventable,\r\nprovided that there be no careless indifference, and that time and\r\ntrouble be devoted to the object it is sought to attain. It is to Miss\r\nOrmerod’s persevering efforts that this change is due; it is to her\r\npersistent enquiry year after year into the causes of mischief and into\r\nthe means of removing them that the subject of agricultural entomology,\r\nwhich so long had languished in this country, gradually forced its way\r\nto the front, until it has become recognised that some serviceable\r\nknowledge of it is indispensable to the mental equipment, and cannot be\r\nomitted from the technical training of the aspiring agriculturist.\r\nReadily and gratuitously she has answered day after day all inquirers,\r\nwhilst for twenty-four consecutive years her pen and pencil have been\r\ndevoted to the preparation of the annual reports, every one of which she\r\nhas generously published at a nominal price, which year after year\r\ninvolved a substantial loss. ‘But the work was hard,’ she now tells\r\nus—and the simplicity of her words renders them eloquent—‘for many years\r\nfor about five or six months all the time I could give to the subject\r\nwas devoted to arranging the contributions of the season for the Annual\r\nReport of the year.’ In spite of indifferent health, at times\r\naccompanied by much physical suffering, Miss Ormerod has carried on her\r\nself-imposed task, and the result is that she has revolutionised the\r\nsubject of agricultural entomology, as it was understood in this country\r\ntwenty-five years ago. Not only at home, not only throughout the British\r\nEmpire, but in all progressive countries Miss Ormerod’s name takes first\r\nrank amongst the Economic Entomologists of the day, and correspondence\r\nreaches her from beneath almost every flag that flies. And, now that the\r\ntime has come when this talented lady feels it expedient to no longer\r\nwork at the high pressure which has so long been maintained, all who\r\nhave benefited by her disinterested labour—and they are very many—will\r\njoin in the hope that she may long live to enjoy the comparative leisure\r\nto which she is looking forward.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          APPENDIX C (p. 143).\r\n\r\n_Contents of Insect Cases Shown at the Bath and West of England Show at\r\n    St. Albans (May, 1896), now the Property of the University of\r\n    Edinburgh, kept along with Miss Georgiana Ormerod’s Diagrams in the\r\n    Museum of Science and Art, Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE I.—WEEVIL ATTACKS TO PEAS, BEANS, AND CLOVER-SEED, AND LEAFAGE. 1.\r\n    Infestations of Pea seed. 2.

Official Entomological\r\nJournal), says:—“Miss E. A. Ormerod wrote us on September 23, 1889, as\r\nfollows: ‘... The beetle which is considered one of the rarest of the\r\nBritish Coleoptera, _Xyleborus dispar_, Fab. (formerly known as\r\n“Bostrichus” or “Apate,” Fig. 46) has appeared in such great numbers in\r\nplum-wood in the fruit grounds at Toddington, near Cheltenham, as to be\r\ndoing very serious injury. I found, on anatomising the injured small\r\nbranches, that one of the galleries which the horde of beetles (packed\r\nas closely as they can be) forms or enlarges, passes about two-thirds\r\nround in the wood, more or less deeply beneath the bark, whilst another\r\nof the tunnels, likewise occupied with its closely packed procession of\r\nbeetles, was in possession of about two inches of pith, so that the\r\nrapid destruction of the tree was fully accounted for. The attack\r\nappears, as far as I can see, to disappear usually very rapidly, but I\r\nam advising owners to make sure. This disappearance, I conjecture, may\r\narise from the excessive rarity of the small male of this species.\r\nAmongst about sixty ♀(female specimens) which I extracted from the\r\ntunnels I only found one ♂ (male).’”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          APPENDIX E (p. 223).\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles Valentine Riley was killed by a fall from his bicycle\r\nin the streets of Washington. He was riding, as usual, to his office in\r\nthe morning, accompanied by his young son. It was down-hill, and he was\r\nevidently going rather fast, when his wheel struck a stone carelessly\r\nleft in the roadway after repairs. He was thrown violently, and died\r\nfrom the effects of the fall a few hours afterwards.[118]\r\n\r\n‘Biologist, artist, editor, and public official, the story of his\r\nstruggles and successes, tinged as it is with romance, is one full of\r\ninterest. Beginning life in America as a poor lad on an Illinois farm,\r\nhe rose by his own exertions to distinction. His nature was a many-sided\r\none, and his success in life was due to sheer will-power, unusual\r\nexecutive force, critical judgment, untiring industry, skill with pencil\r\nand pen, and a laudable ambition, united with an intense love of nature\r\nand of science for its own sake. This rare combination of varied\r\nqualities, of which he made the most, rendered him during the thirty\r\nyears of his active life widely known as a public official, as a\r\nscientific investigator, while of economic entomologists he was _facile\r\nprinceps_.\r\n\r\n‘He was born at Chelsea, London, September 18, 1843. His boyhood was\r\nspent at Walton-on-Thames, where he made the acquaintance of the late W.\r\nC. Hewitson, author of many works on butterflies, which undoubtedly\r\ndeveloped his love for insects. At the age of eleven he went to school\r\nfor three years at Dieppe, afterwards studying at Bonn-on-the-Rhine. At\r\nboth schools he carried off the first prizes for drawing, making\r\nfinished sketches of butterflies, thus showing his early bent for\r\nnatural history. It is said that a restless disposition led him to\r\nabandon the old country, and at the age of seventeen he had emigrated to\r\nIllinois, and settled on a farm about fifty miles from Chicago. When\r\nabout twenty-one he removed to Chicago, where he became a reporter and\r\neditor of the entomological department of the “Prairie Farmer.”\r\n\r\n‘Near the close of the war, in 1864, he enlisted as a private in the\r\n134th Illinois regiment, serving for six months, when he returned to his\r\neditorial office.\r\n\r\n‘He also enjoyed for several years the close friendship of B. D. Walsh,\r\none of our most thorough and philosophic entomologists, with whom he\r\nedited the “American Entomologist.” His industry and versatility, as\r\nwell as his zeal as an entomologist, made him widely known and popular,\r\nand gave him such prestige that it resulted in his appointment in 1868\r\nas State Entomologist of Missouri. From that time until 1877, when he\r\nleft St. Louis to live in Washington, he issued a series of nine annual\r\nreports on injurious insects, which showed remarkable powers of\r\nobservation both of structure and habits, great skill in drawing, and\r\nespecially ingenious and thoroughly practical devices and means of\r\ndestroying the pests. It goes without saying that this prestige existed\r\nto the end of his life, his practical applications of remedies and\r\ninventions of apparatus giving him a world-wide reputation. In token of\r\nhis suggestion of reviving the vines injured by the Phylloxera by the\r\nimportation of the American stock, he received a gold medal from the\r\nFrench Government, and he afterwards received the Cross of the Légion\r\nd’Honneur in connection with the exhibit of the U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture at the Paris Exposition of 1880.\r\n\r\n‘The widespread ravages of the Rocky Mountain locust from 1873 to 1877\r\nhad occasioned such immense loss in several States and Territories that\r\nnational aid was invoked to avert the evil. The late Dr. F. V. Hayden,\r\nthen in charge of the U. S. Geographical and Geological Survey of the\r\nTerritories, sent Dr. P. R. Uhler to Colorado in the summer of 1875. Mr.\r\nWalsh had made important suggestions as to the birthplace and migrations\r\nof the insect. Meanwhile Riley had since 1874 made very detailed studies\r\non the migration and breeding habits and means of destruction of this\r\nlocust. Dr. Cyrus Thomas had also been attached to Hayden’s Survey, and\r\npublished a monograph on the locust family, _Acrididæ_. As the result of\r\nthis combined work Congress created the United States Entomological\r\nCommission, attaching to it Dr. Hayden’s Survey, and the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior appointed Charles V. Riley, A. S. Packard, and Cyrus Thomas\r\nmembers of the Commission. Dr. Riley was appointed chief, and it was\r\nmainly owing to his executive ability, business sagacity, experience in\r\nofficial life, together with his scientific knowledge and practical\r\ninventive turn of mind in devising remedies, or selecting those invented\r\nby others, that the work of the Commission was so popular and successful\r\nduring the five years of its existence. In 1878, while the Report of the\r\nCommission was being printed, Riley accepted the position of\r\nEntomologist to the U. S. Department of Agriculture, but owing to the\r\nlack of harmony in the Department, he resigned, Professor J. H. Comstock\r\nbeing appointed. Congress meanwhile transferred the cotton-worm\r\ninvestigation [on which Riley had been engaged] to the Entomological\r\nCommission. Dr. Riley was reappointed to the position of U. S.\r\nEntomologist in June, 1881. Mr. L. O. Howard said of the administration\r\nof this office: “The present efficient organisation of the Division of\r\nEntomology was his own original conception, and he is responsible for\r\nits plan down to the smallest detail. It is unquestionably the foremost\r\norganisation of its kind at present in existence.” Again he writes:\r\n“Professor Riley’s work in the organisation of the Division of\r\nEntomology has unquestionably advanced the entire Department of which it\r\nis a part, for it is generally conceded that this Division has led in\r\nmost matters where efficiency, discipline, and system were needed.”\r\n\r\n‘His Division published the first bulletin, and in “Insect Life” began\r\nthe system of periodical bulletins, which has since been adopted for the\r\nother Divisions of the Agricultural Department. In an address, says\r\nHoward, before the National Agricultural Congress, delivered in 1879, in\r\nwhich he outlined the ideal Department of Agriculture, Professor Riley\r\nforeshadowed many important reforms which have since become accomplished\r\nfacts, and suggested the important legislation, since brought about, of\r\nthe establishment of State Experiment Stations under the general\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n‘His practical, inventive genius was exhibited in his various means of\r\nexterminating locusts, in the use of kerosene oil emulsified with milk\r\nor soap, and in his invention and perfection of the “cyclone” or\r\n“eddy-chamber” or Riley systems of nozzles, which, in one form or\r\nanother, are now in general use in the spraying of insecticide or\r\nfungicide liquids.\r\n\r\n‘Although the idea of introducing foreign insect parasites or\r\ncarnivorous enemies of our imported pests had been suggested by others,\r\nRiley, with the resources of his division at hand, accomplished more\r\nthan any one else in making it a success. He it was who succeeded in\r\nintroducing the Australian lady-bird to fight the fluted scale.\r\n\r\n‘Riley’s scientific writings will always stand, and show as honest work.\r\nHe was not “a species man” or systematist as such; on the contrary, his\r\nmost important work was on the transformations and habits of insects,\r\nsuch as those of the lepidoptera, locusts and their parasites, his\r\nMissouri reports being packed with facts new to science. His studies on\r\nthe systematic relations of Platypsyllus as determined by the larva\r\nevince his patience, accuracy, and keenness in observation and his\r\nphilosophic breadth.\r\n\r\n‘His best anatomical and morphological work is displayed in his study on\r\nthe mode of pupation of butterflies, the research being a difficult one,\r\nand especially related to the origin of the cremaster, and of the\r\nvestigial structures, sexual and others, of the end of the pupa.\r\nWhatever he did in entomology was original. He was also much interested\r\nin Aëronautics, and took much delight in attending séances of\r\nspiritualists and exposing their frauds, in one case, at least, where\r\nanother biologist of world-wide fame, then visiting in Washington, was\r\ncompletely deluded.\r\n\r\n‘Riley was from the first a pronounced evolutionist. His philosophic\r\nbreadth and his thoughtful nature and grasp of the higher truths of\r\nbiology are well brought out in his address on “The Causes of Variation\r\nin Organic Forms,” as Vice-President, before the biological section of\r\nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1888. He was\r\na moderate Darwinian, and leaned, like other American naturalists,\r\nrather to Neo-Lamarckism. He says: “I have always had a feeling, and it\r\ngrows on me with increasing experience, that the weak features of\r\nDarwinism and, hence, of natural selection, are his insistence (1) on\r\nthe necessity of slight modification; (2) on the length of time required\r\nfor the accumulation of modifications, and (3) on the absolute utility\r\nof the modified structure.” Riley, from his extended experience as a\r\nbiologist, was led to ascribe much influence to the agency of external\r\nconditions, remarking, in his address: “Indeed, no one can well study\r\norganic life, especially in its lower manifestations, without being\r\nimpressed with the great power of the environment.” He thus contrasts\r\nDarwinism and Lamarckism: “Darwinism assumes essential ignorance of the\r\ncauses of variation and is based on the inherent tendency thereto in the\r\noffspring. Lamarckism, on the contrary, recognizes in use and disuse,\r\ndesire and the physical environment, immediate causes of variation\r\naffecting the individual and transmitted to the offspring, in which it\r\nmay be intensified again both by inheritance and further individual\r\nmodification.”’\r\n\r\n‘“Evolution shows that man is governed by the same laws as other\r\nanimals.” “Evolution reveals a past which disarms doubt and leaves the\r\nfuture open with promise—unceasing purpose—progress from lower to\r\nhigher. It promises higher and higher intellectual and ethical\r\nattainment, both for the individual and the race. It shows the power of\r\nGod in what is universal, not in the specific; in the laws of nature,\r\nnot in departure from them.”’\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n =A=\r\n\r\n _Abraxas grossulariata_, Magpie moth, 114 (Fig.)\r\n\r\n _Accentor modularis_, Dunnock or Hedge-sparrow, 162\r\n\r\n _Acrididæ_, 333\r\n\r\n “Agriculture and Rural Economy of Australia and New Zealand,” Professor\r\n    Wallace’s, 280\r\n\r\n Agriculture, Board of, Miss Ormerod’s aid to the Adviser given and\r\n    withdrawn, 202\r\n\r\n Agricultural College (Royal), Cirencester, Miss Ormerod’s lectures at,\r\n    83;\r\n   Professor Harker at, 83;\r\n   Principal of, 201\r\n\r\n Agricultural Education Committee, 271, 272, 273\r\n\r\n Agricultural Education in the Elementary School, 271\r\n\r\n Agricultural Entomology, progress of, 200;\r\n   work on, 276;\r\n   Miss Ormerod, Co-Examiner in, 282\r\n\r\n Agricultural lectureship proposed in Oxford University, 225\r\n\r\n Agricultural Society (Royal), Miss Ormerod’s diagrams for, 88;\r\n   work for discontinued, 212\r\n\r\n “Agricultural Zoology,” by Dr. Ritzema Bos, translated by Professor\r\n    Ainsworth-Davis, 222\r\n\r\n _Agrotis exclamationis_, Heart-and-dart moth, Linn., 101 (Fig.)\r\n\r\n _Agrotis segetum_, Ochsenheimer, Turnip moth, 101 (Fig.)\r\n\r\n “Alder Killer,” German name of Mottled Willow Weevil, 267\r\n\r\n Aldersey schoolboys, 113, 119, 127\r\n\r\n Alfalfa (lucerne) hay infested with locusts, 228, 229\r\n\r\n _Alopecurus pratensis_, 244\r\n\r\n Altum, Dr. Bernard, _Forst Zoologie_, 61\r\n\r\n American Ambassador, congratulations of the, 193\r\n\r\n American blight, _see_ _Schizoneura lanigera_, 142, 143, 144\r\n\r\n American clover-seed midge, 198\r\n\r\n American migratory locusts, South, 229\r\n\r\n Anbury, club-root, or finger and toe, _see_ _Plasmodiophora_, 196, 213\r\n\r\n Angoumois moth, 188\r\n\r\n _Anguillulidæ_ (eel-worms), 198, 282\r\n\r\n _Anguillula radicicola_, 213\r\n\r\n Annual Reports, _see_ Reports\r\n\r\n _Anobium paniceum_, 253\r\n\r\n _Anthomyia ceparum_, 60\r\n\r\n Antler moth, _see_ _Charæas graminis_\r\n\r\n Ants, black, 138\r\n\r\n “Ap Adam” oak, 93, Pl. xxi\r\n\r\n _Aphides_, 79;\r\n   attack of, 222, 250, 257\r\n\r\n Aphis, woolly, _Schizoneura lanigera_ 144 (Fig.)\r\n\r\n Apple-bark beetle, _see_ _Xyleborus dispar_, 199\r\n\r\n Arbuthnot, Mrs., 292, 301\r\n\r\n Architects, practice of, 7\r\n\r\n Arderne of Alvanley, family of, 13\r\n\r\n _Argyresthia conjugella_, 247\r\n\r\n Arkwright (J.

Fryer, Ph.D., M.A., begins an admirable, fully illustrated\r\n  paper on “Leaden Fonts” in the _Archælogical Journal_, March, 1900,\r\n  with the following statements: There are 27 leaden fonts situated in\r\n  12 counties in the south, east and west of England—8 in Gloucester, 3\r\n  in Berks, 3 in Kent, 3 in Sussex, 2 in Oxford, 2 in Hereford, 1 in\r\n  Derby, 1 in Dorset, 1 in Hants, 1 in Lincoln, 1 in Norfolk and 1 in\r\n  Surrey. Several of these date from the latter part of the 11th and the\r\n  12th centuries. A few belonged to the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries,\r\n  and the latest has the date 1689 impressed upon it. They are all\r\n  tub-shaped, with the exception of two, namely, a hexagon and a\r\n  cylindrical bowl. The older fonts all possessed covers, and several\r\n  retain the markings to which the locks were attached. The deepest bowl\r\n  (outside measurement) is 16 inches. The most shallow bowl is at Parham\r\n  in Sussex, and it is only 8½ inches in depth. The diameters also vary\r\n  considerably from 32 inches to 18½ inches.—(ED.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  “And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne, a book\r\n  written within, and on the backside sealed with seven seals.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  “The Oxford Movement” or “Catholic Revival” was initiated as a result\r\n  of statutory changes in the position of the Church of Ireland, which\r\n  it was feared might ultimately be extended to England. The position\r\n  and possible danger of the Church were fully discussed in the _Tracts\r\n  for the Times_, ninety in number, issued from Oxford during the nine\r\n  years, 1833-41, and chiefly written by Newman, Keble, Pusey, Williams,\r\n  and Froude. The object of the movement was to rouse the members of the\r\n  whole Anglican Community to promote corporate reforms in the Anglican\r\n  Church as a National Institution—changes which the Evangelical Revival\r\n  of the end of the eighteenth century had failed to introduce. The line\r\n  adopted in the movement has been described as “a _via media_ between\r\n  Roman Catholicism and Reformation doctrines.” (ED.).\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Afterwards Bishop of Grahamstown, Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  My notes are taken from the copy of a plan (now before me) by my\r\n  brother Henry Mere Ormerod, solicitor, Manchester: see page 58.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  The _Sailing Directions for the West Coast of England_, published by\r\n  the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty, says:—“Depths: There is\r\n  a depth of about 46 feet in the river to Chepstow at high water\r\n  springs, and 36 feet at high water neaps.” “Tides: It is high water,\r\n  full and change, at Chepstow at 7 h. 30 m. local or 7 h. 41 m.\r\n  Greenwich time; mean springs rise 38 feet and neaps 28½ feet. The tide\r\n  has, however, been known to rise as high as 56 feet.” (E.A.O.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  See Appendix A.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  See quotations in _Hist. of British Quadrupeds, including the\r\n  Cetacea_, by Thomas Bell, F.R.S., &c. pp. 469-472.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  _Manual of Elementary Geology_, by Sir Charles Lyell, F.R.S., fifth\r\n  edition, 1855, pp. 337, 338.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  For some years previously the possibility of transmission, at a low\r\n  rate of speed, of goods or mineral products had been established by\r\n  George and Robert Stephenson, against great opposition in some cases.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Chartism was an excited, and, in some instances, violent political\r\n  movement which occurred in Great Britain consequent upon the dire\r\n  distress and poverty of the labouring classes in the thirties of the\r\n  nineteenth century, and their disappointment with the results of the\r\n  Reform Bill of 1832. In June, 1839, a monster petition was presented\r\n  to the House of Commons with 1,280,000 names attached. Its\r\n  unsympathetic reception fanned the rebellious spirit abroad among the\r\n  working classes and led to an increase of unruly disturbances, and to\r\n  the outbreak at Newport, here described. The movement collapsed in\r\n  1848, and with the development of the industrial prosperity of the\r\n  country, largely due to the use of steam power in manufacturing\r\n  centres, and the vast improvement of the economic and social condition\r\n  of the people, together with greater political freedom, any return of\r\n  the perfectly natural, if not even justifiable, spirit of discontent\r\n  became impossible.

Writing in 1900 she says:—“My first regular\r\n  paper was printed in the Journal of Linn. Soc., vol. xi., No. 56,\r\n  Zoology, July 18, 1873, on _The Cutaneous Exudation of the ‘Triton\r\n  cristatus.’_ I think it is sound and unusual!”\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  To such of my readers as possess some portion only of the early\r\n  series, it may be of interest to point out that the observations, up\r\n  to those for 1880 inclusive, were arranged, not as afterwards, as\r\n  detached papers, placed alphabetically under the heading of the names\r\n  of the crops to which they referred, but under the numbers given in\r\n  the successive preceding guide lists issued for the use of\r\n  observers—as for instance, “6, _Anthomyia ceparum_, Onion fly;” or\r\n  “25, _Abraxas grossulariata_, Magpie moth” (fig. 9).\r\n\r\n  These were arranged numerically, from “1” onwards, all the\r\n  observations on one kind of insect attack being arranged successively\r\n  in a long unbroken paragraph under the selected number, together with\r\n  the name of the pest. For want of better knowledge of the requisites\r\n  for a readable as well as useful report, I condensed the information\r\n  into as few words as possible, with few, if any, breaks in the long\r\n  paragraphs, and so, until 1880, the results (excepting to technical\r\n  readers) could not be considered “taking.” If any of my entomological\r\n  readers will turn to a very useful work, the _Forst Zoologie_, of Dr.\r\n  Bernard Altum, they will see in the second division of the “Insecten”\r\n  at pp. 36, 37, and again at pp. 162, 163, the difficulties that are\r\n  thrown in the way of comfortably grasping the subject, by the matter\r\n  being printed continuously without breaks. This, however, as well as\r\n  many other things, I had then still to learn.

Failing to obtain a\r\n  lecturer through South Kensington, at my suggestion, he called on Miss\r\n  Ormerod. She suggested that I should take the subject, and added that\r\n  she would give me all the assistance in her power. From that day up to\r\n  the day of her death she took the kindest interest in our work. She\r\n  presented to the school many books, beautiful diagrams, and a series\r\n  of insect cases [prepared by Mosley of the Huddersfield Museum, after\r\n  the cases arranged by Professor Westwood and Miss Ormerod for the S.\r\n  and A. Museum at Bethnal Green], and was a liberal donor of prizes at\r\n  Midsummer from 1885 to 1901 (both inclusive). Every Midsummer she\r\n  kindly wrote a letter to be read on that occasion to the boys. I think\r\n  I ought to add that the Haberdashers’ Company were good enough to make\r\n  a grant of £25 to start us with this new subject, and have since\r\n  generously supported the carrying on of the work.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Continuation of Miss Ormerod’s letter to Mr. Bailey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  See Chaps. xix.-xx. for letters to Dr. Fletcher.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  See Chap. xxii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  Letters to Mr. Bailey continued.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  This refers to Bunbury only, where we had nearly a “clean bill” in\r\n  that year.
