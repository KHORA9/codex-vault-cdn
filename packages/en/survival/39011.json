He says, in effect, \"I do not want to know all about the\r\nbiology of the fungus of wheat-rust, or of the _phylloxera_, nor do I\r\nwant to learn what experts can tell me about the action of bacteria in\r\nsoil, or the process of starch-formation in the leaves: I have neither\r\nthe time nor the means to master these details. What I want is guidance\r\nas to what is wrong with my tomatoes, apple trees, chrysanthemums, fir\r\ntrees, turnips, etc., and what I am to do to set things right.\" Just\r\nso. With the latter part of this cry one must sympathize, much as a\r\ndoctor does with the wail of the parent who calls him in to cure his\r\nsick child--we need not stop to classify or compare the motives of the\r\nparent and the cultivator, and perhaps I had done better to select a\r\nbreeder of sheep with his flock and a veterinary doctor in the\r\nillustration, but we will let it pass; and as regards the former part of\r\nthe cry, I do not know that the plant-doctor can expect the cultivator\r\nto be initiated in the aetiology of the disease any more than the\r\nphysician expects the parent to understand the biology of the typhoid\r\nbacillus. That both the cultivator and the parent would be the better\r\nfor a real knowledge of the disease in either case must be admitted--nay\r\ninsisted on, provided the knowledge _is_ real--but we have to deal with\r\nfacts, and it is a fact that the clients of both doctors are impatient\r\nof the details of the case.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, I am aware that no short cut or \"royal road\" to science\r\nexists, and if a man is going to train up trees or other plants, he\r\nought to know all about them in health and in sickness, in youth and in\r\nold age, and he ought to learn everything about the soil they grow in,\r\nthe air that surrounds them, the enemies that beset them, and all the\r\nmultifarious relations of these one to another; but when I look at my\r\nboy and reflect how much his nurse, his schoolmaster, his tutor, his\r\ndoctor, and his parents _ought_ to know successively and simultaneously\r\nabout him in sickness and in health, and about his surroundings, etc., I\r\nbegin to wonder whether there is not after all something to be said for\r\nthe cultivator's point of view.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the cultivator knows a good deal about his plants which I do\r\nnot know, and although I should much like to know it, his plea of want\r\nof time rings in my ears and the conviction strikes home that one ought\r\nto try and meet his views, and tell him something about disease as\r\nmanifested in plants without insisting on his becoming a professional\r\nmycologist, entomologist, agricultural chemist, and philosopher.\r\n\r\nOf course, beyond a certain point, it is his lookout how much the\r\ninformation is worth, and its educational value--a very different\r\nmatter--is sure to suffer from any restrictions imposed on the treatment\r\nof the subject; but if the theme of disease in plants, treated from a\r\ngeneral point of view--I was about to write \"treated in a popular\r\nmanner,\" but that is impossible until physiology and mycology are more\r\nwidely taught--enables him to understand better the questions he puts to\r\nhimself, and, still more, if it stimulates him to enquire further into\r\nthe inexhaustible field of science glimpsed at, something may come of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these essays is to treat the subject of disease in plants\r\nwith special reference to the patient itself, and to describe the\r\nsymptoms it exhibits and the course of the malady, with only such\r\nreferences to the agents which induce or cause disease as are necessary\r\nto an intelligent understanding of the subject, and of the kind of\r\ntreatment called for. Consequently I have avoided any unnecessary\r\nclassification or elaborate descriptions of parasitic fungi or insects,\r\nhistological details of the tissues of plants, chemical and physical\r\ndetails regarding the soil, and even matters purely physiological as far\r\nas possible. Several admirable works on these subjects are already\r\navailable, and must be referred to for further details.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, quite out of the question to avoid technicalities,\r\nthough I have chosen the simpler course wherever it was found feasible,\r\nand have tried to so employ the examples selected that the student who\r\nwishes to go further into the matters dealt with may turn to special\r\ntreatises for further information. For one eminently technical section I\r\nought perhaps to apologise, but the temptation to try and set forth, in\r\nconcrete form and suitable for the purposes of this book, some account\r\nof what is known of the most essential and profound factors concerned in\r\nthe difficult question of the nature of life and death, health and\r\ndisease, was great. Probably my apology should go further, and apply to\r\nwhat after all must be failure to explore this mystery to the bottom: my\r\nonly excuse must be that it may stimulate others to go further.\r\n\r\nIt was an afterthought to add, in Part I., the considerations on the\r\nfactors which influence the plant regarded as a living machine, so to\r\nspeak, in order that the student may the better apprehend the point of\r\nview taken of the bearings of the matters discussed in Part II.\r\n\r\nWith regard to references, it seemed a better plan to give, in the form\r\nof notes after each chapter, the titles of the principal books and\r\npapers on which a student may base a further course of reading, than to\r\noverweight the pages of what is, after all, merely an introductory\r\nsketch to a huge subject, with detailed quotations from the numerous\r\nsources of information made use of. I have freely expressed my own\r\nopinions, but the sources for others are, I hope, as freely given. It\r\nwill, however, be understood that I have not aimed at a complete\r\nbibliography, and, particularly, I have only given foreign references\r\nwhere it seemed that adequate treatment of the subject could not be\r\nfound in English.\r\n\r\nMy sincere thanks are due to Mr. F. Darwin, F.R.S., who has kindly\r\nlooked through many of the proofs, and given me the benefit of several\r\nsuggestions: and to my wife for the very material aid she has afforded\r\nme in the preparation of the index.\r\n\r\n                                                H.

Agricultural\r\n     chemistry. The plant a machine. Physiology._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were asked to sum up the most important result of the numerous\r\nadvances made during the past decade in agriculture and forestry, I\r\nshould reply--the clearer and wider recognition of the fact that the\r\nplant itself is the centre of the subject, and not the soil, climate,\r\nseason, or other factors of its environment. Until comparatively recent\r\ntimes it was the habit of farmers, foresters, planters, and gardeners,\r\nall the world over, to look upon the plant as a mere item or as a\r\nmysterious if important one in their calculations, and to regard the\r\nsoil as the chief factor in their studies.\r\n\r\nNow all is changing, and the world is gradually awakening more and more\r\nto the recognition of the truth that the soil and the clouds and the\r\natmosphere are merely reservoirs of more or less inert materials, from\r\nwhich the living plant draws its supplies, and works them up, by means\r\nof energy focussed from the sun, into new plant substance.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the more far-seeing pioneers of scientific agriculture\r\nand forestry, etc., are recognising that agricultural chemistry is not\r\nthe be-all and end-all of agricultural science; but that, in place of\r\nthe study of the chemical analyses of dead soil, water, air, and\r\nplant-remains, which has so long held sway, largely owing, I think, to\r\nthe influence of Liebig, the student should have his attention more\r\nconcentrated on the living plant itself and on the physiological actions\r\nwhich make up its life. He must regard the living plant as a sort of\r\nworking machine--infinitely more complex than any machine made by man,\r\nbut a machine nevertheless--the purpose of which is to store up energy\r\nfrom the sun, and so to add to our wealth on this planet, at the expense\r\nof the extra-terrestrial universe.\r\n\r\nIt is not, be it noted, that the new study proposes to ignore or abandon\r\nthe old studies: modern physiology owes too much to the physics and\r\nchemistry on which it is partly based, and to the labours of De\r\nSaussure, Ingenhousz, Priestley, and others, for that. But it is that\r\nthe new study recognises that the central point, to which all views must\r\nbe focussed, is not the one that it was formerly supposed to be. The\r\nstudent is still taught that the chemistry of soils yields valuable\r\ninformation, and that lessons of importance are derived from comparisons\r\nof the analyses of the ashes, etc., of plants; but he is no longer able\r\nto cherish the hope, however remotely, that such studies solve his most\r\nimportant problems.\r\n\r\nThe scene--or rather the point to which attention is now directed--is\r\nthe living, working, energy-accumulating plant itself, and not the dead\r\nstore of materials in the soil. The reason for the change is not far to\r\nseek: it is due to the enormous strides made in the study of the\r\nphysiology of plants during the last quarter of a century, and the\r\nsubject abounds in examples illustrating the marvellous advances that\r\nhave been made, and at the same time showing how, in the progress of\r\nresearches, made for their own sake--_i.e._ in pursuit of satisfaction\r\nfor the intense curiosity of the scientific man--all kinds of side\r\nissues turn up which prove to be of value in practice, and suggestive of\r\nfurther thinking.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century--_i.e._ about 1820--the best\r\nthinkers were giving up the old ideas that the environment supplied\r\nfood, as such, to plants, and had recognised that the plant takes up\r\nsubstances from without and rearranges these in its own body.\r\n\r\nThe next twenty years or so form a very dark interval in plant\r\nphysiology, chiefly owing to the influence of the assumption of a\r\nspecial \"vital force,\" an assumption which was not allowed merely to\r\nserve as a hypothesis put forward to stimulate research and suggest\r\nbetter ideas, but which gained a hold over men's powers of reasoning to\r\nan extent which now appears monstrous and phenomenal.\r\n\r\nMany errors crept in during this reign of terror, one of the most fatal\r\nof which was De Candolle's revival of the idea of \"spongioles\"; and\r\nanother, equally disastrous in many of its effects, was the conception\r\nof a sort of vegetable food-extract, humus, existing in the soil in a\r\nform peculiarly suitable for direct use by plants. It was during this\r\nperiod that the confusion between the processes of respiration and\r\ncarbon-dioxide assimilation arose, and exerted its effects for evil into\r\nour own day.\r\n\r\nThe now astounding statement that oxygen-respiration in plants did not\r\noccur, laid the foundation of many subsequent difficulties, and so did\r\nthe positive and authoritative views on the uses of minerals to the\r\nplant. Liebig, in fact, stood in the invidious position of being a high\r\nauthority on purely chemical questions, who was impelled to give\r\nopinions on matters which can only be solved by physiological\r\nexperiments: his great service was to clear up mistakes as regards the\r\nchemistry of soils and of plants--his great mistakes were due to his\r\npronouncing on physiological matters; and it may be doubted whether his\r\ngreat services to the purely chemical side of subjects connected with\r\nagricultural matters are the more to be admired, or the disastrous\r\ninfluence of his statements on subjects which do not belong to the\r\ndomain of chemistry should be the more deplored. Be that as it may, he\r\nhanded on to succeeding generations some weighty errors as regards\r\nplant-life, and taught the agriculturist to regard chemical analyses of\r\nsoils and plant ashes with a reverence which obstructed progress for\r\nsome time. As a set-off to this we must place his contributions to the\r\ndestruction of the bugbear vitalism, which was simply preventing\r\nenquiry, and his services in bringing together and sifting with power\r\nand originality all that had been then acquired as regards the chemistry\r\nof the plant, the soil, and the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThat Liebig was indispensable in 1840-1850 is one thing; but that his\r\ninfluence should extend to the present day is quite another, and his\r\ninevitable mistakes were almost as powerful for future evil, as his\r\nclear exposition of the chemistry of his day was productive of immediate\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nBoussingault, working at the same time, 1837-1855, but experimentally\r\nwith the living plant, taught us more about these matters than\r\nany investigator of the time, though it is very probable that the\r\nstimulus of Liebig's speculations, good and bad, had its effect in\r\nimpelling Boussingault to devote his splendid methods to problems of\r\nplant-nutrition. Boussingault's contributions to our knowledge of the\r\ncomposition of the dead plant cannot be over-estimated; but he did more\r\nthan this, because he so clearly apprehended the necessity for asking\r\nhis questions directly of the living plant, instead of deducing from\r\nchemical principles what might be supposed to occur in it; and although\r\nfuture researches showed that even so careful an investigator solved a\r\nproblem of first importance--viz. the question of the fixation of free\r\nnitrogen--the wrong way, it will be found that so far as he did go his\r\nconclusions were sound, and well calculated to inspire the confidence\r\nwith which the world received them. As we are here concerned more\r\nespecially with the botany of agriculture, however, it is unnecessary to\r\ndwell longer on these matters, or on the similar and even more extensive\r\nexperiments, of world-wide reputation, carried on for so many years, and\r\nstill being carried on under the liberal auspices of Sir John Lawes, at\r\nRothamsted. Moreover it may be necessary to return to some of these\r\npoints later on.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     The reader will find a further general account of these\r\n     matters in Sachs' _Lectures on the Physiology of Plants_,\r\n     especially Lectures I. and XII., Engl. ed., Oxford, 1887. He\r\n     may then proceed to Pfeffer's _Physiology of Plants_, Engl.\r\n     ed., 1899, chapter I., and to the account of the history of\r\n     the subject in Sachs' _History of Botany_, Oxford, 1890,\r\n     especially pp. 359-375 and 445-524. References to more special\r\n     literature will be found in Pfeffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PLANT AND ITS FOOD.\r\n\r\n     _The food of plants--\"Vital force\"--Other errors--Liebig and\r\n     Boussingault--The botany of agriculture. The synthesis of\r\n     carbohydrates--The physiology of plant-nutrition. The\r\n     persistence of misconceptions._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1860 may be regarded as a landmark of importance in the history\r\nof plant physiology, for it was in that year that Sachs discovered that\r\nthe bringing together of water and carbon-dioxide, in the green\r\nchlorophyll-corpuscles of the plant exposed to sunlight, results in the\r\nformation of the grains of starch found in these corpuscles.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this date Dutrochet (1826-37) had introduced the then crude\r\nidea of osmosis into physiology; vegetable anatomy had improved, and the\r\nmodern conceptions of the living cell, protoplasm, nucleus, etc., were\r\nslowly looming; sieve-tubes had been discovered, and the proteids and\r\nstarch in various parts of the plant examined; and the suggestion was\r\nabroad, replacing Liebig's idea that plant acids were the first\r\nproducts of carbon-assimilation, that some substance, of a slimy nature,\r\nwas manufactured in the cells of the leaves and thence distributed as\r\nthe formative material from which the plant constructed its parts. Davy\r\nand Boussingault had even surmised that a carbohydrate might be the\r\nfirst-formed product in assimilation.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that Sachs' classical proof, by direct\r\nphysiological observation and experiment, first brought forward the\r\ntruth of organic synthesis in the plant in a concrete and convincing\r\nform.\r\n\r\nBut it did more than that. It laid the foundation of the modern\r\nphysiology of plant-nutrition on ground already prepared by De Saussure\r\nand the earlier workers; for, in addition to emphasising the truth of\r\norganic synthesis--a truth which had been gradually impressing itself on\r\nthe world for some years--Sachs' discovery showed clearly the real\r\nmeaning of carbon-assimilation as a process for obtaining combustible\r\nfood, which the plant then proceeds to make use of.\r\n\r\nMany points were rapidly cleared up at once, or if not explained were at\r\nleast put into a strong light for further enquiry, and plant-nutrition\r\nsoon ceased to be the mysterious subject for all kinds of wild\r\nconjectures that it had hitherto been.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of thin leaves, with numerous stomata and finely ramified or\r\ndivided vascular bundles, became more apparent, as also did the\r\nsignificance of the ascending transpiration current; the storage of\r\nstarch-grains in tubers, medullary rays, roots, seeds, etc., obtained\r\nmeanings not understood before; the spread of roots in the soil, and the\r\ngradually discovered properties of the finer rootlets and of the\r\nroot-hairs, fitted naturally into their places; and, in short, a\r\nthousand facts, otherwise isolated, became collated into an intelligible\r\nsystem, full of suggestions for new work, such as has since gone on and\r\nis now being pursued with an activity and success never before realised\r\nin the history of science.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, while the general truth of Sachs' views was confirmed,\r\na number of detailed discoveries were made which seemed to contradict\r\nthem in certain points. It was found that not all leaves form starch,\r\nfor some contain sugar or oil; but Holle and Godlewski proved\r\nexperimentally that this oil may be replaced by starch if the conditions\r\nof assimilation are slightly modified. More recently Hebert discovered\r\nthat the stalks and leaves of grasses contain a peculiar form of gum,\r\nwhich was formerly confounded with starch, a substance not abundant in\r\nthem. Then came Schimper's discovery of starch-forming corpuscles,\r\nwhich, if supplied with sugar, are able to form starch-grains in the\r\ndark, as in tubers, etc., underground; and as subsequent researches have\r\nproved that the chlorophyll-corpuscles--which are morphologically the\r\nsame as the starch-forming corpuscles and can be replaced by them--are\r\nalso able to form starch-grains from sugar, as proved by the experiments\r\nof Boehm, Acton, Meyer, Laurent, Bokorny, Saposchnikoff, and others, it\r\nsoon became evident that nothing essential needed altering in Sachs'\r\nview that starch is the first visible product of carbon-dioxide\r\nassimilation, only it became clearer that the starch-grains are built up\r\nby the protoplasm from glucose or some similar body, and represent so\r\nmany packets of reserve materials put by for the present because not\r\nrequired for the immediate needs of the cell.\r\n\r\nBoussingault showed, about thirty years ago, that assimilation soon\r\nstops in green leaves if cut off from the plant, not because the leaves\r\ndie, but owing to some \"maximum capacity\" being attained. Sachs had\r\nshown that the starch passes down to other parts of the plant in\r\nsolution as glucose.\r\n\r\nNeither time nor space will permit me to go into the enormous field of\r\nresearch and results opened up by these and similar observations made\r\nbetween 1860-70. It must suffice to say that they led to the discovery\r\nand study of the diastatic and other enzymes in the leaves and other\r\ngreen parts of plants, and to a clearer understanding of what was\r\nalready known of them in seeds, and this knowledge reacted at once on\r\nour insight into the processes of transport of reserve materials and\r\nconstructive materials from one part of the plant to another, matters\r\nwhich will be referred to later on.\r\n\r\nIt remains to explain Boussingault's difficulty as regards the cessation\r\nof assimilation. Recent researches confirm the view that at least three\r\ncauses are at work to bring about the inhibition of the\r\ncarbon-assimilation: first, the chlorophyll-corpuscles become filled to\r\nexcess with starch, which cannot get away because all the passages are\r\nfull and the products are inhibiting the further action of the enzymes\r\nwhich should dissolve the solid granules; secondly, the leaf being\r\ndetached from the plant explains why the soluble products cannot get\r\naway, for this makes a great difference in the rate of exhaustion of the\r\nleaf; and, thirdly, the same fact involves that the leaf can obtain no\r\nfurther supply of salts of potassium, etc., without which elements the\r\nprocesses in question cannot go on.\r\n\r\nThese and numerous other deeper insights into the process of\r\nassimilation, obviously strengthen the force of Sachs' discovery; though\r\nit by no means necessarily follows that starch-grains are always the\r\nresting form of the products of assimilation, and we now know that such\r\nis often not the case: we now have much deeper glimpses into the initial\r\nproducts of carbon-assimilation than Sachs had in 1860, but this\r\nenhances rather than detracts from the importance of his splendidly\r\nworked-out discovery. Put more generally, we may now say that the\r\nprocess of carbon-dioxide assimilation in green leaves under the\r\ninfluence of light is a process of synthesis--photo-synthesis--resulting\r\nin the building up of a carbohydrate such as sugar, inulin or starch\r\nfrom the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that the importance of Sachs' discovery, and\r\nthe rapid consequent extensions of our knowledge, did their work\r\nforthwith in disabusing men's minds of old and erroneous notions. To say\r\nnothing of numerous smaller misconceptions which still held their ground\r\nowing to the stupendous ignorance of plant-physiology which prevailed,\r\nwe find incompetent teachers and text-books were still propagating ideas\r\nworthy of ancient times. The confusion between oxygen-respiration and\r\nthe gas interchanges in carbon-assimilation was by no means eliminated\r\neven recently, though it can no longer withstand the deliberate\r\nonslaughts now made on it. That the roots take up food as such from the\r\nsoil, and that that food is directly employed by the plant for its\r\nnutrition is even yet implied in daily conversation around us; and\r\nalthough matters have advanced so far that everyone now knows that the\r\nsubstances at the roots must be in solution, ere they can be received\r\ninto the plant, it sometimes leads to astonishing replies, if we press\r\nthe question very far as to how the absorption takes place, in an\r\nelementary examination of agricultural students. That manures are foods\r\nto the plant, that sap circulates, that transpiration is of use to keep\r\nthe plant cool, and wood is a \"porous body,\" etc., are only a few of the\r\nmisconceptions still current, in a decade that has found publishers for\r\na work advocating that roots are congealed sap, and that the leaves of\r\nplants absorb the moisture and dust of the air, and so provide the plant\r\nwith food, and for a paper explaining the action of root-hairs as tubes\r\nwith open pores at their tips. But the gravest misapprehensions current\r\namong us are due to the crude ideas as to what a plant really is: this,\r\nI take it, is owing to the difficulty of grasping what physiologists\r\nmean by organised structure, and leads to regarding the living being\r\neither as a mere aggregation of chemical compounds, built up by the\r\nordinary play of chemical forces, as we know them, acting on dead\r\nmatter, or, as in the days before organic chemistry, as a mysterious\r\nentity endowed with \"vital force,\" and with properties not amenable to\r\nscientific investigation. The mistaken notions as to the powers of roots\r\nto \"select\" those substances which the plant requires, and to reject\r\nuseless ones was merely an expression of this belief.\r\n\r\nThe rock on which all are liable to come to grief--the chemist or\r\nphysicist who requires all his facts in terms of analyses and\r\nproportions by weight, and therefore takes too mechanical a view of the\r\nsubject, or the man who is not scientifically trained at all, and\r\ntherefore is more liable to go to the other extreme and regard the plant\r\nas a mysterious something which grows and has poetical associations and\r\ntraditions--is the great fact of organised structure, and it is the\r\nrecognition of this fact and some of its consequences which has altered\r\nthe whole position of the subject, and brought the study of the plant\r\ninto the domain of physiology. The living plant, its structure and\r\norganisation, the functions of its mechanism, and its relations to the\r\nenvironment, thus forms a subject apart from that which concerns the\r\nchemical composition of the plant and its environment, and this\r\ndistinction designates, in a word, as it were, the change which has been\r\nbrought about by modern biology.\r\n\r\nA point to be emphasised to the utmost where agricultural students are\r\nconcerned is that the essential process of feeding is the same in a\r\ngreen plant, a fungus, and an animal; the greatest confusion still\r\nexists with regard to this matter, owing to misconceptions as to the\r\nreal meaning of the functions of the chlorophyll-corpuscles when\r\nsupplied with carbon-dioxide and water and the energy of the sun's rays.\r\nThe plant does not feed on carbon-dioxide, any more than it feeds on\r\noxygen--it feeds on the organic material after it has been constructed,\r\nand the chlorophyll-function is merely one mode of obtaining supplies of\r\nsuch organic substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the references in the last chapter, the student\r\n     should consult Sachs' _Lectures_, XVII.-XIX., and Pfeffer's\r\n     _Physiology_, pp. 287-329, for the further development of this\r\n     subject. An excellent resume, with new facts and points of\r\n     view, will be found in Dr. Horace Brown's \"Address to the\r\n     Chemical Section,\" _British Association Reports_, Dover, 1899;\r\n     and \"Chemistry and Physiology of Foliage Leaves\" in _Trans.\r\n     Chem.

The action of light--The\r\n     chlorophyll-function._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations of the plant to the environment can only be understood by\r\ntaking into account the results of modern physiological discoveries.\r\nThese teach us that the living plant is a highly complex machine, the\r\ndetails of its organisation and structure being much more numerous and\r\nmuch more closely correlated at numerous points, than the parts of any\r\nother machine known to us.\r\n\r\nThey also teach us that it is supplied with energy from without, as any\r\nother machine; and that when so supplied, and properly working, the\r\nliving structure or machinery does work, also as other machines. But\r\nmodern physiology goes further, in that it renders some account of the\r\nways by which the external energy is taken into the plant, and there\r\napplied to do work, or stored up for a time in order that it may be used\r\nto do work at some future time.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of energy thus ensured is associated with corresponding\r\nchanges of material substance, and the principal means for bringing this\r\nabout is recognised in the assimilation of carbon-dioxide--photo-synthesis.\r\n\r\nIn this process energy enters the chlorophyll-corpuscle in the form of\r\nthe radiant energy of the sun, it is there directed in the mechanism of\r\nthe protoplasm, so as to do work on the molecules of water and\r\ncarbon-dioxide which have also been brought into the machinery; this it\r\ndoes, breaking asunder their stable structure into unstable bodies,\r\nwhich then re-combine in different ways to form a carbohydrate, such as\r\nstarch, and this starch is temporarily stored as grains, while oxygen\r\nescapes.\r\n\r\nEach starch-grain, therefore, is to be regarded as a packet of matter\r\nand of potential energy, as it were, capable of yielding up the latter\r\nat any future time, when put under such circumstances that it must do\r\nso. Such stores of energy-yielding substance, if I may use the\r\nmuch-abused phrase, form the principal food of the plant--or of an\r\nanimal, if it steps in and takes them--and we now see that the process\r\nof carbon-dioxide assimilation, as it has perhaps unfortunately been\r\ncalled, is not the same thing as the process of feeding, for the\r\n_feeding_--_i.e._ the nutrition proper--of the plant does not begin\r\nuntil the _food_ has been thus obtained.\r\n\r\nWe now see what the real position of the plant is, to its environment,\r\nwhether the latter be living or dead. From our point of view, the plant\r\nserves as a centre for bringing together the substances obtainable from\r\nthe soil, and those derived from the atmosphere, and so focussing and\r\ndirecting the radiant energy of the sun upon these substances, that they\r\nare broken up, and some of their constituents synthesised, with\r\nabsorption of energy, into a body, such as starch, containing more\r\nenergy than did the original substances taken together or separate. It\r\nmatters little whether the actual carbohydrate thus synthesised is\r\nstarch, or sugar or inulin: the point is that energy has been gained\r\nfrom outside and bound up with the acquired material for further use.\r\nBut modern physiology has carried matters much further than this, and\r\nespecially in the three following directions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it has shown that much of the energy thus stored\r\nfrom without in the plant is again liberated in the process of oxygen\r\nrespiration, and expended partly as appreciable heat and partly as\r\ndriving force for stimulating the machinery of the living plant to\r\nfurther activities.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, part of it is rearranged with the rearrangement of\r\nthe molecules with which the energy is bound up, as it were, so that\r\nwork of various kinds is done _in_ the machinery of the plant: I refer\r\nto various metabolic and surface-actions resulting from the peculiar\r\nmode of presentment of the resulting substances, for instance the\r\nproduction of osmotic pressures in the cell.\r\n\r\nAnd, thirdly, part of the synthesised substance is worked up into higher\r\nbodies, by processes which obviously entail the further doing of work on\r\nthe constituents.\r\n\r\nThe further pursuit of this theme would evidently carry us beyond the\r\nmore immediate subject of this book; but I want to make clear that\r\nrecent researches render it more and more certain that the living plant\r\nis a complex piece of co-ordinated machinery which brings together\r\nmatter and energy from the external universe, and then gets work out of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nThis proposition is the more important because the whole question of the\r\nenrichment of our planet with new food, new building materials, and new\r\nfuel, to compensate the daily losses, depends on it, and is of course to\r\nbe referred fundamentally to the acquirement of new supplies of energy\r\nfrom the sun. Enormous activity has been displayed by physiologists,\r\nsince 1860, in attempting to solve the question, which of the many\r\ndifferent rays known to proceed from the sun are absorbed by the\r\nchlorophyll-corpuscle, and directed to the performance of the work above\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nThe names of Draper, Sachs and Pfeffer stand forth prominently as\r\npioneers in this; while those of Lommel, Engelmann, Timiriazeff and\r\nLangley have been among the most active in making important\r\ncontributions to the subject, and in attempting to answer the further\r\nquestions connected with the mode in which the chlorophyll is concerned\r\nin utilising the energy of the solar radiations. The point is one of\r\nsupreme importance, because it goes on all fours with modern questions\r\nas to the rays of light absorbed or dispersed in our atmosphere at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year, or in special climatic conditions, to say\r\nnothing of its other scientific aspects. Unfortunately, however, we have\r\nno satisfactory explanation of the actual role played by the chlorophyll\r\nsubstance itself, in spite of much industrious work which has been done\r\nin the subject in this country and elsewhere. As regards the rays\r\nemployed, it was first proved that the most effective belong to the red\r\nend of the visible spectrum, and that the effect as measured by the\r\namounts of oxygen given off, and of starch formed in given periods of\r\ntime, is more or less proportionable to the intensity of the solar\r\nlight. Then it was established that no monochromatic light is so\r\npowerful as the white light from which it was obtained, though the\r\nrelative numbers expressing the activity in the red and yellow regions\r\nmay stand to those in the blue as something like 12:1. The latest\r\nresults place the maximum assimilation in the red-orange, and this\r\ncoincides with the maximum absorption in the chlorophyll. If we may\r\naccept the current views as to the distribution of energy in the\r\nspectrum of solar light, which depends on the complete absorption of all\r\nthe rays by a black body, where they are estimated as heat, we have the\r\ninteresting result that the agricultural or forest plant is adapted to\r\ncatch and retain, broadly speaking, just those particular rays which\r\npossess most energy.\r\n\r\nThe probability is increasing that the protoplasmic machinery is the\r\nreally effective mechanism in the process, and we may figure this\r\nmachinery as so holding or presenting the molecules of carbon-dioxide\r\nand water to the impact of the light-vibrations, that the latter are\r\nenabled to undo the molecular structure; the atomic combinations thereby\r\nliberated may then be supposed to form a body like formic-aldehyde,\r\nwhich by polymerisation becomes a carbohydrate of the nature of a sugar\r\nsuch as glucose, which the protoplasm then builds up into its substance\r\nand subsequently deposits as starch, and stores temporarily in the form\r\nof grains or as amorphous material.\r\n\r\nThis is partly hypothetical, and is largely due to the careful\r\ndeductions of the chemists, but there are very many facts now to hand\r\nwhich bear out its probability, especially the recent advances in our\r\nknowledge of the sugars, and the experimental feeding of leaves and\r\nplants deprived of starch with such substances as dextrose, levulose,\r\nmaltose, and other sugars, as well as glycerine and other bodies which\r\nshould be convertible into, or yield them, if the theory is true. In\r\nthis last connection, the careful and extensive experiments of Acton, A.\r\nMeyer, Boehm, and Laurent should be mentioned. It would be interesting\r\nto enlarge upon Engelmann's beautiful physiological experiments in\r\nconnection with this subject of absorption of solar energy, where the\r\nmaximum accumulation of oxygen-loving bacteria at those parts of a green\r\nalga which lie in the red-orange of the spectrum, are used as indicators\r\nof the maximum oxygen evolution (and therefore of the maximum\r\ncarbon-dioxide assimilation), but space will not admit of this. For a\r\nsimilar reason I must also pass over the same observer's experiments\r\nwith plants which assimilate in protoplasm behind a red instead of a\r\ngreen substance, and which absorb chiefly other rays between the yellow\r\nand blue, with the remark that they also seem to imply that it is the\r\nprotoplasmic machinery which turns the energy on to the carbon-dioxide\r\nmolecule, the coloured screen being secondary in the matter. Recent\r\nexperiments which show that green plants will not assimilate\r\ncarbon-dioxide in a light which has passed through a solution of\r\nchlorophyll--and therefore left its red rays behind; nor behind a screen\r\nof iodine dissolved in carbon-dioxide--which lets no visible rays\r\nbetween the red and blue pass--should be noticed, as showing the\r\nimportance of the chlorophyll and the special rays referred to, however;\r\nand I ought at least to mention Timiriazeff's beautiful proof, published\r\nin 1890, that if, on the leaf of a plant left in the dark long enough to\r\nrender it free of starch, a bright solar spectrum is steadily projected\r\nfor 3-6 hours, the chlorophyll then removed by alcohol and the\r\ndecolorised leaf placed in iodine, the image of the spectrum is\r\nreproduced by the different intensities of the starch bands, blue with\r\niodine, in the different parts. Here, again, the maximum coloration\r\ncoincides with the maximum absorption in and near the red.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic observations and photo-chemical experiments alike convince\r\nus that the chlorophyll-corpuscle is itself a complex piece of\r\nprotoplasmic machinery, working for and with the rest of the plant, and\r\nthere can be little question as to the greater accuracy of our reasoning\r\non the whole question I am discussing, since Meyer, Schimper,\r\nPringsheim, and others have established the importance of its structural\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nI must now pass on to consider another aspect of the question of\r\ncarbon-assimilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the references in the last chapter, the reader\r\n     may be referred to Sachs' _Lectures_, XXV., and Pfeffer's\r\n     _Physiology_, pp. 329-356, where the voluminous literature is\r\n     given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMETABOLISM.\r\n\r\n     _Quantities of starch formed, and their significance for the\r\n     plant. The absorption of energy--the conversion of energy in\r\n     the plant. The plant is a complex machine for concentrating\r\n     and storing energy and material from without._\r\n\r\n\r\nSachs measured the increase in dry weight (due to the carbohydrates\r\nformed in the chlorophyll-corpuscles) per square meter of leaf-surface,\r\nexposed for a definite period, by drying rapidly at 100 deg. C. equal areas\r\nof the leaves concerned, and comparing the weights.\r\n\r\nOf course the results are not to be pushed too far, in view of the fact\r\nthat some of the starch is continually passing away to be utilised, and\r\nof the difficulties of comparing the weather, the intensity of light,\r\ncurrents of air, hygroscopic conditions of atmosphere, and other\r\nvariable factors which influence the matter. For instance, the stomata\r\nopen and close to different extents according to the conditions of\r\nlight and moisture, and this affects the whole mechanism of\r\ntranspiration especially, and therefore the supplies of water and\r\nmineral salts. Nevertheless, some interesting and valuable results have\r\nbeen obtained in connection with this important subject.\r\n\r\nIt was found, for instance, that the foliage of a sun-flower or of a\r\nvegetable-marrow may be forming starch at a rate of considerably over a\r\ngram per hour in every square meter of leaf-surface exposed on a fine\r\nday; while in particularly clear and warm sunny weather Sachs obtained\r\nas much as 24 to 25 grams per square meter per diem.\r\n\r\nWhen one reflects that 200 square meters is not an extravagant estimate\r\nfor the area of leaf-surface exposed on a tree, for a period which even\r\nin our latitudes may be considerably over 100 days of, say, ten hours'\r\nlight, we need no longer wonder at the rapidity with which wood is\r\nproduced in the stems, and similar estimates (which I have purposely\r\nkept lower than the estimates for continental and tropical climates) may\r\nsuffice to show how quickly potatoes or the ears of corn, etc., may fill\r\nup with the starch or other carbohydrates which render them valuable as\r\ncrops. We want more measurements in these connections, moreover, for\r\nthere are several ways in which they are of scientific value and\r\npractical importance.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what has been said that every grain of starch formed\r\nrepresents so much energy, packed away for the moment in the\r\nstorehouses of the plant; and we know that--quite apart, however, from\r\nintermediate transformations of the energy thus stored--this energy\r\nreappears in the kinetic state eventually, when the starch is burned\r\noff, in presence of oxygen, and transformed into carbon-dioxide and\r\nwater. It matters not how quickly or how gradually this combustion\r\noccurs, or whether it is accomplished by burning in a fire, or by slow\r\nand complex stages in respiration or metabolism: the point is that the\r\nunit of weight of starch yields so many units of heat when its structure\r\ntumbles down to the original components, carbon-dioxide and water.\r\n\r\nClearly, if we know how many units of heat are yielded by the combustion\r\nof one gram of starch, we can obtain an estimate of the amount of\r\nenergy, measured in terms of heat, which the foliage gains and stores\r\nup--an estimate which will approach the truth in proportion as our\r\nestimate of the total assimilative activity is correct.\r\n\r\nA word of warning is necessary here, however, for those best acquainted\r\nwith physiology recognise that however useful such calculations as the\r\nabove may be, and undoubtedly are, to give a general idea of the fact\r\nthat the energy represented is large, it would be a mistake to suppose\r\nthat such estimates give even an approximate measure of the energy of\r\npotential which may be got from the carbohydrate, and still less of the\r\namount of work that may be got from its employment, according to the way\r\nit is employed or presented in the plant. To take a single instance\r\nonly. If the carbohydrate is rapidly burned off to carbon-dioxide and\r\nwater, very little is got out of it in the way of work--most, if not\r\nall, of the energy set free escapes as heat: whereas if the carbohydrate\r\nis slowly and gradually oxydised, passing through various stages and\r\ngiving rise to powerfully osmotic bodies in the process, or if it is\r\nbuilt up into protoplasm, or into the structure of a cell-wall,\r\nrelatively enormous quantities of work may be got out of its\r\nsurface-energy, and heat may be absorbed. Whence it follows that we\r\ncannot measure the power for physiological work of a body by merely\r\nobtaining its heat of combustion, any more than we can infer its\r\nsignificance in metabolism from its chemical properties.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion that the plant stores large quantities of energy\r\nmay of course be arrived at by simply estimating the enormous quantities\r\nof food-material which we obtain annually from agricultural plants.\r\n\r\nModern physiologists have attempted to proceed further than this,\r\nhowever, in their essays to form an estimate of the relations between\r\nthe available energy in the solar rays and that used and stored in the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nIf we reflect on such phenomena as the cool shade of a tree, and the\r\ndeep gloom of a forest, and on experiments which show that an ordinary\r\nleaf certainly lets very little of the radiant energy of the spectrum\r\npass through it, it becomes evident that many of the rays which fall on\r\nthe leaf are absorbed in some form, and it becomes very probable that\r\nmuch of the solar energy, other than that we term light, is retained in\r\nthe leaf for other purposes than assimilation--or, at least, no other\r\nconclusion seems possible in view of all the facts. Engelmann's\r\nresearches with purple bacteria are almost conclusive on this point, and\r\nwe may regard it as extremely probable that the plant makes other uses\r\nof rays, perceived by us as heat-rays, as sources of energy. Researches\r\non the influences of temperature on assimilation and other functions\r\npoint to the same conclusion; and Pfeffer and Rodemann definitely state\r\nthat heat is converted into work in the osmotic cells. And the study of\r\nthe absorption bands in the spectrum of the living leaf becomes more\r\nintelligible in the light of these conclusions. Moreover, the fact that\r\na plant still carries on processes of metabolism when active\r\ntranspiration has lowered its temperature below that of the surrounding\r\nair--and the plant therefore receives heat from the environment--points\r\nto similar conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the conclusion is immense, for even if the plant had\r\nno other sources of energy than the darker heat rays of the solar\r\nspectrum, it is clear that it ought to be able to do work.\r\n\r\nThe above may suffice for the general establishment of the conclusion\r\nthat the plant absorbs more radiant energy than it employs solely for\r\nassimilation, and emphasises our deduction that it is a machine for\r\nstoring energy.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, how is this relatively enormous gain in energy\r\nemployed by the plant? Our answer to the question is not complete, but\r\nmodern discoveries in various directions have supplied clues here and\r\nthere which enable us to sketch in some degree the kinds of changes that\r\nmust go on.\r\n\r\nNot the least startling result is that, important as carbon-assimilation\r\nis as the chief mode of supplying energy, it is not the only means that\r\nthe plant has of obtaining such from the environment, and it is even\r\npossible--not to say probable--that energy from the external universe\r\nmay be conveyed into the body of the plant in forms quite different from\r\nthose perceptible to our eyes as light.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent survey of this domain, it is pointed out that we may\r\ndistinguish between radiant energy, as not necessarily or obviously\r\nconnected with ponderable matter, and mechanical energy, which is always\r\nconnected in some way with material substance. All mechanical\r\nperformances in the plants depend on transformation of some form of\r\nthese, evident either as actual energy doing mechanical work, or as\r\nenergy of potential ready to do work.\r\n\r\nIn so far as molecular movements are concerned, we have the special form\r\nof chemical energy. The evolution of heat, light and electricity by\r\nplants are instances of radiant energy, and so on.\r\n\r\nMany transformations of energy in the plants are due to non-vital\r\nprocesses--_e.g._ transpiration, warping actions, etc., but we cannot\r\nalways draw sharp lines between the various cases. Nor can we directly\r\nmeasure the work done in the living machinery; but from the effects of\r\npressures and strains, the lifting of heavy weights, driving of\r\nroot-tips into soil, osmotic phenomena, etc., it is certain that the\r\nvalues may be very high.\r\n\r\nThe following classes of processes in living protoplasm and cells may be\r\ntaken as indicators. First we have transformation of chemical energy,\r\nwithout which continued life is impossible: in many cases--_e.g._ the\r\nprocesses connected with oxygen respiration--these result in the\r\ndevelopment of heat. Secondly, we have those remarkable manifestations\r\nof energy known as osmotic processes, which depend on surface actions,\r\nand with which may be associated other surface effects, such as\r\nimbibition, secretion, etc., and in connection with which heat may be\r\nevolved or absorbed. It is true the substances which exhibit the\r\nproperties here referred to may be produced, or placed in position, by\r\nchemical energy, or they may be absorbed by roots, etc.; but the\r\nproximate energy exhibited by them is not derived from chemical energy,\r\nand may be out of all proportion to the chemical energy of the substance\r\nor substances concerned. Moreover it is significant to note that a\r\nhighly oxydised body may develop much osmotic energy, as well as a\r\nhighly combustible one.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance to realise the truth that much work can\r\nbe, and is done in the living plant, by conversions of energy of\r\npotential independent of and out of proportion to the chemical energy\r\navailable by decomposing the substances concerned; even the heat of\r\nrespiration may be superfluous here, for the plant may absorb heat from\r\nwithout, and convert it into work.\r\n\r\nTensions often arise in the plant, and do work expressed as\r\nmovements--_e.g._ the springing of elastic Balsam fruits, stamens of\r\n_Parietaria_, etc.\r\n\r\nOsmotic energy not only results in enormous pressures and tensions, but\r\ncauses movements by diffusion and diosmosis, and any given osmotic\r\nsubstance which carries this energy with it is not necessarily formed\r\nalways in the same way in the cell--_e.g._ glucose may arise from\r\nstarch, or from carbon-dioxide, or from oil.\r\n\r\nSurface-energy is also expressed in the powerful attractions for water\r\nexhibited in imbibition, swelling, capillarity, absorption, surface\r\ntensions, etc.\r\n\r\nTranspiration induces relatively enormous disturbances of equilibrium,\r\nand does work in moving water quite independent of chemical energy.\r\n\r\nAgain, what may be termed excretion-energy, as expressed in the\r\nseparation of a solid body--_e.g._ a crystal--from a solution, may be\r\nfor our purposes regarded separately. Any change in the condition of\r\naggregation of a substance in the plant may result in movements and the\r\novercoming of resistances.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident from this short digression--and this is the point I\r\nwish to emphasise--that in the interval between the securing of a grain\r\nof starch, representing so much energy won from the external universe,\r\nand the reconversion of this grain into its equivalent carbon-dioxide\r\nand water, by respiration, resulting in the loss of the above energy as\r\nheat, the starch referred to may have undergone numerous transformations\r\nin the living machinery of the plant, and have played at various times a\r\nrole in connection with the most various evolutions of energy.\r\n\r\nIf we try to picture a possible case, we may take the following. A given\r\nstarch-granule, after being built up in the chlorophyll-corpuscle, is\r\ndecomposed, and yields part of itself as glucose, which passes down into\r\nother parts of the plant in solution. Part of it is merely re-converted\r\ninto starch, and temporarily stored: another part passes into the arena\r\nof oxydation-processes, the sum of which constitute respiration, and may\r\nserve for a time in the molecules of an organic acid: yet another part\r\nmay be converted into a constituent of the cellulose cell-walls; while\r\npart may be brought into play in the reconstruction of protoplasm.\r\n\r\nIn this last connection a discovery made by Schulze about 1878, and\r\nfollowed up later by Pfeffer, Palladin, and others is of importance.\r\nSeedlings growing in the dark, or in an atmosphere devoid of\r\ncarbon-dioxide in the light, become surcharged with nitrogenous bodies\r\nknown as amides, formed during the breaking down of the proteids in the\r\ndestructive process preceding and accompanying respiration: if the\r\nseedlings are allowed free access to light and carbon-dioxide, however,\r\nthe amides disappear. The explanation is that they are combined with\r\nsome of the materials of the carbohydrates, and again built up into the\r\nmaterial of the living protoplasm.\r\n\r\nReturning to our hypothetical starch-grain--or, rather, its parts--we\r\nhave some of it retained as starch, in excess, simply because it is not\r\nneeded at the moment: another portion gives up its energy in\r\nrespiration, and this does work on the spot, or is lost as heat; or in\r\nthe body of an organic acid, or its salt, the part in question may do\r\nlifting or pressing work by osmosis, or cause diffusion-currents from\r\none cell to another. In the constitution of the cell-wall we may have\r\npart of our starch-grain aiding in imbibition or in the establishment of\r\nelastic tensions in turgidity: and, finally, parts may be built up into\r\nthe living protoplasmic machinery of the plant.\r\n\r\nWhat is true for the starch-grain is also true for any particle of salt,\r\nor water, or gas which enters into the metabolism of the living plant,\r\nregard being paid to the particular case, and circumstances in each\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that the plant cannot be properly studied\r\nmerely as the subject of chemical analysis or of physical investigation;\r\nyou might as well expect to understand a watch by assays of the gold,\r\nsilver, steel and diamonds of which its parts are made up, or to learn\r\nwhat can be got out of the proper working of a lace machine by\r\nanalysing the silk put into it, and the fabric which comes out, and by\r\ntaking the specific gravity of its parts and testing the physical\r\nproperties of its wheels and levers.\r\n\r\nThis is not the same thing as denying the value of such knowledge, in\r\nthe case of either the dead machine or the living plant: it is merely\r\nemphasising the supreme importance of the study of the structure and\r\nworking of the active machinery in both cases.\r\n\r\nNor is it pertinent to remark on the apparent hopelessness of physiology\r\nbeing at present able to explain the seemingly infinite complexity of\r\nthe living machinery of protoplasm and its activities. The modern\r\nlocomotive is also a complex affair in its way, but it is profitable to\r\ninvestigate it and to know all one can of its working and possibilities,\r\nfor obvious reasons: a little reflection will convince us that it is\r\nalso worth while to investigate that complex machine, the plant--the\r\nworking organism which alone can really enrich a country. Moreover, we\r\nought to be encouraged by the satisfactory progress now being made, and\r\nthe splendid practical results which are accruing, rather than dismayed\r\nby the prospect of unflagging labour which will be required in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nEnough has perhaps been said to establish the general truth that the\r\nplant is a complex machine for storing energy and material from outside,\r\nand we have seen that modern research has at least gone a long way\r\ntowards determining how the living machine works.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out that important practical\r\nconsequences may result from these phenomena of the accumulation of\r\nsurplus starch or other carbohydrates in the leaves during the day, and\r\nof their disappearance during the night into the lower parts of the\r\nplant. For instance, foliage cut for fodder in the morning is far poorer\r\nin starch than if cut in the evening, and it would be very instructive\r\nto have experiments made on a large scale to test the result of feeding\r\ncaterpillars or rabbits, for instance, with mulberry, vine, or other\r\nleaves in the two conditions.\r\n\r\nAgain, we now see what complications may arise if a parasitic organism\r\ngains access to the stores of carbohydrates in process of accumulation,\r\nor attacks and injures the machinery which is building up such\r\nmaterials, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     The student who desires to pursue this subject further should\r\n     read Sachs' _Lectures_, XX. and XXV., and Pfeffer's\r\n     _Physiology_, pp. 442-566, but he will hardly arrive at the\r\n     best that has been done without consulting Pfeffer's \"Studien\r\n     zur Energetik der Pflanzen\" in the _Abhandl. der Math.-Phys.\r\n     Classe der Kgl.

Malpighi (1687) seems to have been the first to observe\r\nthem, and he took them for capillary tubes. Grew (1682) seems to have\r\nbeen responsible for the view that the roots act like sponges in taking\r\nup water.\r\n\r\nSimon (1768) was probably the originator of the idea that these\r\nroot-hairs were excretory tubules, a view that became very popular at\r\nthe beginning of this century.\r\n\r\nMeyer (1838) was perhaps the first to give a comparative account of\r\nthem, and he supposed them to be delicate prolongations of the\r\nroot-surface to facilitate the absorption of water.\r\n\r\nThe real importance of these organs, however, has only become apparent\r\nsince Sachs, in 1859, recognised their relations to the particles of\r\nsoil between which they extend and to which they cling.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Schwarz made a very thorough study of their biological\r\ncharacter, and in 1887 Molisch gave us new facts as to their physiology.\r\nOur knowledge of them has been rendered very much more intimate by the\r\nresearches of Pfeffer and De Vries on osmotic and plasmolytic phenomena,\r\nand they serve as an excellent study of some of the best results of\r\nmodern physiology.\r\n\r\nIn the normal case, such as is exemplified by a seedling wheat or bean,\r\nthe root-hairs arise some distance behind the growing tip of the root,\r\nan obvious adaptation which prevents their being rubbed off by the soil,\r\nas they would be if developed on parts still actively lengthening. As\r\nthose behind die off, new ones replace them in front, and so we find a\r\nwave of succession of functionally active root-hairs some little\r\ndistance behind the tip of the root: the same order of events holds for\r\neach new rootlet as it emerges from the parent root, and so successive\r\nborings in the soil, made by the diverging root-tips, are thoroughly\r\nexplored by these root-hairs.\r\n\r\nMeasurements have shown that in various plants the surface of root on 1\r\nmm. of length is increased by the root-hairs in proportions given in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n  ------------+---------------------+-----------------+--------------\r\n     PLANT.   |  Area of surface    |    Area of      | No. of times\r\n              | without root-hairs. | root and hairs. |   greater.\r\n  ------------+---------------------+-----------------+--------------\r\n  Maize,      |  4.52 sq. mm.       |  25.13 sq. mm.  |     5.5\r\n  Pea,        |  4.71 sq. mm.       |  58.33 sq. mm.  |    12.4\r\n  Scindapsus, | 14.02 sq. mm.       | 261.9  sq. mm.  |    18.7\r\n  ------------+---------------------+-----------------+--------------\r\n\r\n--which sufficiently establishes the general proposition that the area\r\nof the root-surface is enormously increased by these hairs.\r\n\r\nBut this does not give us any definite idea of the length of the\r\ncylinders of soil explored by these surfaces, until we find that plants\r\nsuch as an ordinary sunflower, hemp, or vegetable-marrow may have roots\r\npenetrating into a cubic meter of soil, in all directions, and so\r\nclosely that probably no volume so large as a cubic centimeter is left\r\nunexplored. Clark found by actual measurement that the roots of a large\r\ngourd, if put end to end, extended over 25 kilometers, and Nobbe gives\r\n520 meters for the roots of a wheat. Vetches may go nine feet deep, and\r\noats more than three feet. The Sal, a tree of the forests of India, has\r\nroots which penetrate to a depth of 50 to 60 feet.\r\n\r\nSome rough notion of the lengths, superficies and penetrating capacities\r\nof the roots of a large tree may be gathered from the above, but it is\r\ndoubtful whether we can form any adequate ideas as to the millions of\r\nroot-hairs which must be developed along the course of these\r\nsubterranean boring organs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking results of modern enquiry into these matters,\r\nis the discovery that the number and superficial area of these\r\nroot-hairs, on one and the same plant, may vary to a large extent\r\naccording to the structure, as it were, of the soil, and the degree of\r\nmoisture it is capable of retaining; or, with the same soil, according\r\nto the amount of water which it receives and holds. Correlations have\r\nalso been observed between the development in length and surface of the\r\nrootlets themselves.\r\n\r\nThe following illustrations will suffice to show this:\r\n\r\nSix young wheat-plants in soil kept constantly wet, developed roots the\r\ntotal length of which measured 365 mm. each, on the average, and almost\r\ndevoid of root-hairs.\r\n\r\nSix similar plants in soil only moderately moist, averaged 668 mm., and\r\nwere well furnished (though not densely covered) with root-hairs.\r\n\r\nSix similar plants in soil which would be termed dry, averaged 371 mm.,\r\nbut were densely covered with rich crops of root-hairs.\r\n\r\nFurther researches have shown that the conditions which rule the\r\ndevelopment of the root-system and root-hairs in the soil are very\r\ncomplex, and not always easy to trace. The most general statements we\r\ncan make are the following:\r\n\r\nThere is an optimum degree of moisture in the soil which promotes the\r\nmaximum development of root-hairs. If the soil is too wet they are not\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThese facts are of importance as correlated with the ease or difficulty\r\nexperienced by the roots in obtaining water, and plants such as our\r\nordinary agricultural plants show this very distinctly.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as shown in the experiments with wheat, the short roots in dry\r\nsoil were more densely covered with root-hairs than the much longer\r\nroots in moderately moist soil, subsequent closer investigation shows\r\nthat the total quantity and area of root-hairs is less in the former\r\ncase than in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of root-hairs are developed on roots which are\r\ngrowing at their best: too much moisture may prevent the formation of\r\nroot-hairs: too little may induce dense growths of root-hairs locally,\r\nbut the total number is reduced.\r\n\r\nAnother set of events which exerts influence on the development of\r\nroot-hairs is the composition of the dilute solution--water containing\r\ndissolved salts--which surrounds them in the soil.\r\n\r\nThus, Schwarz found that when similar oat and wheat plants were grown\r\nwith their roots in solutions of various salts, the results differed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOats in a 15 per cent. solution of calcium chloride developed no\r\nroot-hairs, though they formed in a 5 per cent. solution, and were very\r\nnumerous in a 0.5 per cent. solution, or in water alone. In a 10 per\r\ncent. nutritive solution the plants developed no root-hairs, though\r\nthey were abundant in a 1 per cent. solution.\r\n\r\nWheat plants with their roots in a 15 per cent. solution of potassium\r\nnitrate bore no root-hairs, but they were numerous in a 2 per cent.\r\nsolution of the same salt.\r\n\r\nThese are extreme cases, for, although the roots were not killed, they\r\nwere strongly inhibited in their growth by the more concentrated\r\nsolutions. However, experiments of this kind at least bring vividly\r\nbefore us what variations are possible, and suggest that similar events\r\non a smaller scale may occur in a soil which yields large quantities of\r\nsoluble substances, _e.g._ when freshly manured. Obviously these facts\r\nhave a practical significance as regards kind of soil, drainage, season\r\n(_e.g._ drought or wet), etc.\r\n\r\nBut there are other factors which rule the development of root-hairs,\r\nand some experiments by Lesage show that the correlations between the\r\ndevelopment of root-hairs and roots are probably much more complex than\r\nhad been suspected; for he finds that if the lateral rootlets of a Bean,\r\nin a water culture, are suppressed, the main rootlet develops numerous\r\nand very long hairs to compensate the loss in surface, a matter of\r\nobvious importance in the discussion of cases where roots have been\r\ninjured in the soil.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further it is necessary to look a little more closely\r\ninto the structure of a single hair.\r\n\r\nIt is a tubular prolongation of a single cell of the external covering\r\nof the young root, usually about 1 to 3 mm. in length, and 0.01 to 0.10\r\nmm. in diameter. In special cases the root-hairs of some water plants\r\nmay reach 5 to 18 mm. in length, but of course I am referring to the\r\nordinary land plants of agriculture and forestry. This tubular\r\nprolongation is closed and rounded off at the distal free end, and opens\r\nat the proximal end into the cell of which it is a protrusion.\r\n\r\nThe whole structure is bounded by an extremely delicate and elastic wall\r\nof cellulose, which Frank says is of special composition, almost too\r\nthin to measure in many cases, but often somewhere near 0.005 to 0.001\r\nmm. in thickness. This thin membrane is remarkably permeable by water,\r\nor dilute solutions, as is shown by the rapidity with which a root-hair\r\ncollapses if exposed to evaporation, or with which dense solutions\r\nabstract water from it, or with which solutions may be seen to penetrate\r\nit under the microscope.\r\n\r\nOverlying the thin cell-wall proper, on the outside, is a thin\r\ngelatinous layer, a product of alteration of the outermost lamellae of\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nClosely lining the proper cell-wall on the inside, is an extremely thin\r\nlayer of living protoplasm, and somewhere in this protoplasm is a\r\ndistinct cell-nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the tube is filled with cell-sap, and it is the osmotic\r\npressure of this cell-sap which keeps the whole living instrument tense\r\nand rigid, and the thin protoplasmic film close pressed against the\r\ncellulose cell-wall.\r\n\r\nNothing whatever can pass into the cell-sap, or out from it, without\r\ntraversing both the lining of living protoplasm and the cell-wall.\r\n\r\nIf we gently pull a living root, of wheat, pea, mustard, etc., from a\r\nnormal soil, we find particles of soil so closely adherent to the\r\nroot-hairs that they cannot all be washed off without tearing the hairs:\r\nthe root-hairs establish relations of contact with these particles, so\r\nclose that they are cemented to the solid surfaces by means of the\r\ngelatinous layer already referred to. This peculiarity has the following\r\nconsequences. In the first place, the enormous holdfast, ensured by the\r\nmillions of points of adherence, enables the plant to withstand even\r\npowerful lever actions from above, and provides fixed points against\r\nwhich the root-tips can work as they drive deeper into the soil. In the\r\nsecond place, the intimate contact of the root-hairs and particles of\r\nsoil, ensures that the films of water held by surface-action on the\r\nsoil-particles and root-hairs shall be in continuity with the water\r\nsaturating the cell-walls of the latter, and therefore with the\r\nprotoplasm and cell-sap in their interior. The importance of this at\r\nperiods when the soil is \"dry\" will be obvious, when we reflect that no\r\nsoil is ever naturally so dry that surface-films of water are absent\r\nfrom the particles.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the root-hair contains living protoplasm, enables us to\r\nunderstand to a certain extent the results of the following\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nIf we have a leafy and healthy plant, with roots, bearing numerous\r\nroot-hairs, properly established in suitably moist soil in the pot, the\r\nroots cease to absorb water if the temperature of the soil falls below a\r\ncertain minimum, though they recommence to do so if the temperature is\r\nraised again: this has nothing to do with the temperature of the upper\r\nparts of the plant, or of the air, and the latter may be so high that\r\nthe plant rapidly droops from loss of water at the leaves, which is not\r\nbeing compensated owing to the inactivity of the roots.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we may have the air so cold, at a time when the soil is warm\r\nenough to keep the root-hairs actively at work, that the plant becomes\r\nsurcharged with water, which escapes from the leaves like drops of dew.\r\nThe temperatures necessary to cause these disturbances in the action of\r\nthe living root-hairs vary for different plants, and even for different\r\nvarieties of the same species.\r\n\r\nSimilar arrestation of the functions of the roots may be brought about\r\nby removing the oxygen from the soil around the root-hairs, and\r\nreplacing it by carbon-dioxide, or the vapour of chloroform. If not kept\r\ntoo long in such a condition, the plant recovers rapidly on admitting\r\natmospheric oxygen, which is always present in a normal well-drained\r\nsoil both as gas in the capillary interspaces, and dissolved in the\r\nwater on the surfaces of the particles. If the access of oxygen is\r\ndelayed, however, as often happens in rainy seasons and in wet soils,\r\nthe root-hairs are killed, and rot sets in. A good instance of this has\r\nlately been given by Heinricher in the case of potatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     For the further pursuit of this subject the reader should\r\n     consult Sachs' _Lectures_, II. and XV.; Sorauer, _A Popular\r\n     Treatise on the Physiology of Plants_, 1895, chapters II. and\r\n     IV., and Pfeffer's _Physiology_, pp. 149-163. The principal\r\n     paper on root-hairs referred to in the text is Schwarz, \"Die\r\n     Wurzelhaare der Pflanzen,\" in _Unters. aus dem bot. Inst. zu\r\n     Wuerzburg_, I. Heft 2, 1883, p. 140, where a very exhaustive\r\n     account of these organs will be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTIONS OF ROOT-HAIRS.\r\n\r\n     _Excretions from root-hairs--Osmotic phenomena--Turgescence--\r\n     Plasmolysis--Control of the protoplasm in absorption, etc.\r\n     Selective absorption._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see then that the root-hairs are the active living instruments in\r\nabsorbing the water (containing small quantities of dissolved\r\nsubstances) of the soil.\r\n\r\nIf the living root-hairs are so numerous and so active, however, a\r\nnatural inference is that they must exert some influence on the\r\ncomposition or arrangement of their environment. All the teachings of\r\nmodern physiology go to show that such a living cell as I have sketched\r\ncannot carry on its life, brief though it be--the root-hairs are active\r\nfor about four or five days--without forming substances of the nature of\r\nexcreta, and we should expect some of these to pass out to the soil.\r\n\r\nSachs showed, in 1860, that roots growing in contact with polished\r\nmarble corrode the surface of the mineral, and Nobbe, in 1876, showed\r\nthat the roots of seedlings reduce potassium permanganate, a fact which\r\nMolisch confirmed in 1887. The latter observer also proved that living\r\nroot-hairs secrete substances which colour a solution of guaiacum blue,\r\noxidise pyrogallic acid and other organic substances, and rendered it\r\nprobable that they excrete some substance which inverts cane-sugar, and\r\nin some cases even small quantities of a diastatic enzyme.\r\n\r\nMolisch also confirmed an old observation, that roots excrete\r\ncarbon-dioxide; and he and Czapek showed that the root-hairs excrete\r\nacids more permanent in their nature than carbonic acid, and published a\r\nmethod for showing this by means of a dilute solution, slightly\r\nalkaline, of phenolphthalein.\r\n\r\nMolisch declared that the substances secreted by root-hairs may even be\r\nobserved, dissolved in drops which ooze from the surfaces of the\r\nroot-hairs.\r\n\r\nThat these root-excretions, and particularly the acids, may be of\r\nservice in dissolving and rendering more available various constituents\r\nof the soil is an obvious suggestion, and it is borne out by Sachs'\r\ndiscovery of the corrosion of marble, and by Molisch's observation that\r\nliving roots slowly corrode ivory if continuously kept in contact with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut a deeper insight into the physiology of these organs was only\r\npossible when the meaning of the phenomena of osmosis had been rendered\r\nclearer by the researches of Pfeffer and De Vries in 1877.\r\n\r\nDe Vries showed that the turgescence of the living cell can be\r\ndiminished, and even reduced to nothing, by placing the cell in contact\r\nwith solutions of substances which attract water from the cell-sap: as\r\nthe turgescence diminishes, the cell contracts, owing to the elasticity\r\nof the cell-wall, which was previously distended; if the abstraction of\r\nwater continues, the living protoplasmic membrane lining the cell-wall\r\ncontracts away from the latter. He then proved that no injury need\r\naccrue to the cell by this process of plasmolysis, since the turgescence\r\ncan be restored by washing out the salt with a more dilute solution, or\r\nwith pure water; and the cell may go on living and even growing as\r\nbefore. These phenomena can only be produced in cells where the\r\nprotoplasmic lining is intact and alive.\r\n\r\nPfeffer showed that the whole matter depends on the properties of the\r\nliving protoplasmic membrane, which, so long as it is alive, has the\r\npower of governing the entrance or exit of dissolved substances, but is\r\nas a rule freely permeable for water. If, then, substances with a\r\npowerful attraction for water are formed in the cell cavity, and of such\r\na nature that the protoplasm does not permit their free diffusion to the\r\nexterior, they attract water, and hold it fast, and so set up the\r\ncondition of hydrostatic pressure known as turgescence, the limit of\r\nwhich depends on the attainment of a state of equilibrium between the\r\nelastic reaction of the cell-wall and the distending power of the\r\nabsorbed water. When this limit is reached, water begins to filter back\r\nagain through the cell-wall. Numerous researches during the last fifteen\r\nyears have shown that the sap of such a living cell as the root-hair is\r\ncharged with substances of various degrees of osmotic power; bodies like\r\nsugars, amides, vegetable acids and their salts, being formed by the\r\nmetabolic activity of the protoplasm and accumulated there. Moreover, we\r\nnow know that the salts of the vegetable acids in particular are\r\neffective, and the researches of Warburg and Palladin in 1886 have\r\nplaced it beyond reasonable doubt that these acids are continually being\r\ndeveloped and destroyed in the living cell during normal growth and\r\nrespiration, and that great variations as to quantity may be brought\r\nabout by alterations in the conditions of the environment--_e.g._\r\ntemperature, oxygen, etc.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we bring a solution of some salt, such as potassium nitrate,\r\nwhich has a powerful attraction for water, on the outside of the living\r\nroot-hair, the question whether the water remains in the cell, or passes\r\nout of it, merely depends on whether the substances inside or that\r\noutside have the most powerful attraction on the water in the sap, since\r\nthe protoplasm allows water to pass freely.\r\n\r\nBut the protoplasmic lining may affect the whole matter in another way;\r\nfor it may allow the dissolved salt, or other substance, in the solution\r\noutside or inside the cell to pass through it also, or it may take it\r\nup and fix it, or break it up or otherwise alter it.\r\n\r\nMore recent researches, and especially those of Pfeffer, have shown that\r\nthese diosmotic properties of the living protoplasm are of the utmost\r\nimportance in the whole matter of absorption of substances from the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the following case. A root-hair, in full vigour, is\r\nallowed to bathe freely in a dilute solution of various substances, such\r\nas sugar, potassium nitrate, phosphates, sulphates and carbonates of\r\niron, soda, lime, magnesium and others known by experiment to be\r\nharmless to its life.\r\n\r\nNow it turns out to be by no means a foregone conclusion that all or any\r\nof the substances, even though freely soluble in the water, can pass\r\nthrough the protoplasm into the interior of the cell. Some may be\r\nallowed easy access, others may only be permitted to pass in small\r\nquantities, and others, again, may be absolutely refused access by the\r\ndelicate living filter, so long as it is vigorously alive. Nor, as\r\nproved by numerous experimental cultures since De Saussure's time, is\r\nthe entrance of a salt, etc., ruled by its indispensability or otherwise\r\nin the economy of the plant. And it is important to notice that only\r\nexperiment can prove the point and determine which substances are\r\nabsorbed and which refused by the root-hair.\r\n\r\nIf we now suppose the protoplasm to give rise to powerfully osmotic\r\nsubstances which accumulate in the sap-vacuole, but which are not\r\npermitted free egress through the protoplasm (and the formation of such\r\nbodies will occur if the protoplasm is actively respiring), the\r\nconditions for absorption of water, with or without any dissolved salts,\r\nwhich the protoplasm allows to traverse it, are set up.\r\n\r\nBut the above supposed case is realised, as Pfeffer showed in 1886, when\r\nhe found by a series of beautiful experiments that certain aniline dyes\r\ncan accumulate in living root-hairs, and other living cells, whereas\r\nothers cannot pass the living protoplasm. After accumulating for some\r\ntime, the dye may either remain stored there, or may eventually diffuse\r\nout.\r\n\r\nPfeffer made another discovery, of equal importance, namely, that under\r\nthe influence of dilute organic acids, such as citric acid, the\r\npermeability of the living protoplasm may be altered, so that it allows\r\nsubstances to pass which could not otherwise have traversed it. De Vries\r\nhad also shown that the condition of the protoplasm affects its power of\r\nretaining the colouring matter in the sap of the Beet: so long as the\r\nprotoplasm is alive, the crimson sap is retained, even when the cell is\r\nplasmolysed, but immediately it begins to die the colour escapes through\r\nit. A similar case exists when the chlorophyll-corpuscles retain their\r\ncolour in living cells known to be charged with acids: so long as the\r\nprotoplasm is alive and normally active the green bodies are protected.\r\n\r\nThese, and numerous other experiments of the same kind, prove that the\r\nhealthy root-hair is a living instrument for taking up dilute solutions\r\nout of the soil, and holding them in the sap-cavity for a time. If\r\nkilled, by frost for instance, it loses these powers.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the last ten years have also shown that a time comes\r\nwhen the turgid cell, if an isolated one, and if sufficient supplies of\r\nwater are present, is so tightly distended that the surplus water begins\r\nto diffuse out again under the pressure proper to the hydrostatic\r\nconditions set up.\r\n\r\nNow we arrive at a very critical point.\r\n\r\nWhen the water, or dilute solution of various substances, begins to\r\nexude under pressure from the living root-hair, what is to prevent its\r\nescape into the soil? And if it thus diffuses out, where is the object\r\nof absorption?\r\n\r\nThe questions are obviously pertinent, and they may seem the more so in\r\nthat the cells adjoining the root-hair on its inner side are also\r\nturgid, and possess similar properties to those of the root-hairs. To\r\nestablish a condition of things which shall bring about the inward flow\r\nof the absorbed water, one of the three following cases is conceivable.\r\n(1) The cells, as we pass radially into the root, have different\r\nproperties on the wall of the two sides; or (2) they are more and more\r\ngreedy of water owing to some process of extraction of their water by\r\ntissues in the centre of the root; or (3) these successive series of\r\ncells possess osmotically more powerful contents at periods coincident\r\nwith the escape of the water from the now osmotically weaker root-hairs.\r\n\r\nA little reflection will show that where we have a group of such cells\r\nas the above, all capable of absorbing water and dilute solutions and of\r\nbecoming turgid, movements of the absorbed water must go on until all\r\nthe cells are in equilibrium, as regards their osmotic pressures.\r\n\r\nNow the living rootlet is just such a system, the various cells of which\r\nare in different conditions of osmotic pressure at any given time: some\r\nof these cells are old, and their protoplasm is allowing sap to filter\r\nout under pressure: others are in the height of their vigour, and their\r\nprotoplasm extremely impervious to the highly osmotic sap-constituents\r\nwhich it itself is forming actively: others are too young to have\r\nattained their full turgescence: while others again are in stages\r\nintermediate between the above.\r\n\r\nThere is another point of importance, however, to explain some\r\npeculiarities in the absorption of these dilute solutions of salts,\r\netc., by the root-hairs from the soil, and by cells lying deeper in the\r\nplant from these root-hairs.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that if a root-hair absorbs a given\r\nsubstance--say calcium sulphate, for illustration--and hands it over to\r\nother cells unchanged, a time must be supposed to arrive when, the sap\r\nof all the cells being equally charged with calcium sulphate, no more\r\ncould be absorbed: the rate of absorption of this particular substance,\r\nand the quantity absorbed, up to the hypothetical point of equilibrium\r\nchosen, would then depend simply on the ease with which its molecules\r\ntraversed the living protoplasmic membrane, and the degree of their\r\nsolubility in the sap.\r\n\r\nBut now suppose the following new factor to come in. Suppose that\r\ncalcium sulphate undergoes decomposition in some one of the internal\r\ncells of the system of absorbing cells, or that it is even merely\r\ncrystallised out in such a cell, or in any other way removed from\r\nsolution (_e.g._ by deposition in cell-walls). This alters the state of\r\naffairs considerably. The separation of the molecules from the\r\nsap-solution is itself a cause for the flow of more of the solution to\r\nthe cell concerned, and such causes of diffusion are very common in the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this principle consists in that it lies at the base of\r\nthe whole question of selective absorption, application of manures, and\r\nthe rotation of crops; and those who are acquainted with the excellent\r\nanalytical results of De Saussure, Boussingault, Wolff, Trinchinetti,\r\nGoedechen, etc., and the water-culture experiments of Sachs, Nobbe, and\r\nothers, will understand what an illuminating effect on these points was\r\nproduced by the above generalisation, which we owe especially to\r\nPfeffer's splendid researches into the nature of osmotic phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt will now be clear, I hope, why we regard the living root-hairs as\r\ninstruments--as pieces of living machinery--for the active absorption of\r\nwater, with substances dissolved in it, from the soil; and it will also\r\nbe evident, I think, that no one can form a proper conception of this\r\nmatter of absorption, so important in all agricultural questions, unless\r\nhe pays attention to these biological phenomena. It was hopeless to\r\nexpect to understand these matters merely in the light of chemical\r\nanalyses of plants and soils, and one expression of this hopelessness\r\nwas the belief in the power of roots to select only the substances\r\nuseful to it. We now know that the expression \"selective power of roots\"\r\nhas a totally different meaning from that implied in the minds of the\r\nlast generation of agriculturalists, and it would be easy to devise\r\nexperiments, with solutions of different strength, where the plant\r\nshould be made to take up relatively large quantities of harmless, but\r\nuseless minerals, etc., and to starve in the midst of plenty of the\r\nelements proper to its structure, simply because the former are offered\r\nin a form in which they easily traverse the protoplasm of the\r\nroot-hairs, while the latter are presented in a form unsuitable for\r\nabsorption. That all these matters are of importance in regard to\r\nmanuring and choice of soils, etc., needs no emphasising.\r\n\r\nThese remarks, of course, do not detract from the value of good\r\ncomparative chemical analyses, when viewed in the light of physiological\r\nknowledge, as I need hardly say; but they do, and emphatically so,\r\nattack the position that such analyses alone can explain the problems of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must not rest satisfied with the suggestions so\r\nfar put forward to account for the processes referred to, since it is\r\nimpossible to overlook the fact that in their present form they merely\r\nafford proximate explanations, and are too crudely mechanical for\r\nfinality.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the works referred to in the last chapter, the\r\n     student should consult Pfeffer's _Physiology_, pp. 86-149, and\r\n     pp. 410-441. With reference to water cultures, Sachs'\r\n     _Lectures_, XVII., may also be consulted. The standard work on\r\n     ash constituents of plants is Wolff, _Aschen-analysen_, 1871\r\n     and 1880, an indispensable book of reference in this\r\n     connection, though there are others, quoted in Pfeffer, where\r\n     further literature may also be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE BIOLOGY OF SOIL.\r\n\r\n     _Soil not a dead matrix--Organic materials--The living\r\n     organisms of the soil--Their activities--Their numbers and\r\n     importance. Abandonment of the notion that chemical analysis\r\n     can explain the problem._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is customary to regard the soil, between the particles of which the\r\nroot-hairs of plants are distributed, as if it were merely a dead matrix\r\nof smaller or larger pieces of rock, such as sand, gravel, stones, etc.,\r\nand organic remains, such as bits of wood, leaves, bones, etc., with\r\nwater and air in their interstices. As matter of fact, however, soil is\r\na much more complex body than was suspected until comparatively recent\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, beyond the scope of this book to go into the different\r\nvarieties of soils, their structure or arrangement, and the chemical\r\nnature of their constituent rocks and the debris mingled with the\r\nlatter. For the same reason I must pass over the curious properties of\r\nsoils in relation to the solutions they yield to water in contact, the\r\nmanner in which they retain some of these solutions and allow others to\r\npass easily, and the remarkable double decompositions which go on in\r\nthem. Moreover, I must assume as known the chief physical properties of\r\nordinary soils with respect to the phenomena of capillarity, absorption\r\nof heat, action of frost, and so forth.\r\n\r\nBut all ideas as to the nature of soil based merely on the study of its\r\nchemistry and physics are misleading, and it is in just the\r\nestablishment of this truth that modern discoveries in Agricultural and\r\nForest Botany have played so important a part.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts that organic debris is found chiefly at the surface of\r\nthe earth, and that the smallest particles are held in suspension by the\r\nwater near the surface, it is comprehensible why such organic remains\r\nabound in the upper parts of the soil, where the rootlets with their\r\nabsorbing root-hairs are also found, because they must have oxygen. The\r\nrule is, therefore, that an ordinary soil consists of upper strata, rich\r\nin organic materials and in oxygen, and a subsoil, poorer in these\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nAmong these organic materials are countless myriads of living beings,\r\nespecially fungi and bacteria, which require oxygen and organic\r\nmaterials for their subsistence, and it depends on the open or close,\r\nmoderately moist or damp, warm or cold nature of the soil, and on some\r\nobviously connected factors, how far down these aerobic organisms can\r\nthrive. As we go deeper down they become fewer and fewer, and gradually\r\ndisappear, and (neglecting certain anaerobic bacteria of putrefaction)\r\nthey are rarely found in marked abundance more than a few inches below\r\nthe surface soil.\r\n\r\nThese aerobic fungi and bacteria are the great agents of continued\r\nfertility of a soil, and it is they which, living and multiplying in the\r\nmoist and well-aerated warm interstices of a rich open soil, carry out\r\nthe useful destruction of organic matter, breaking it up into mineral\r\nand gaseous bodies, which are then dissolved in the water bathing the\r\nroot-hairs or escape into the atmosphere. In this work of destruction\r\nthey are aided by the oxygen of the air and the solar heat: their own\r\nfermentative action is also accompanied by a marked rise of temperature,\r\nand the carbon-dioxide and other products of their activity all go to\r\ncomplicate the chemical changes going on in the soil around the roots.\r\n\r\nDuclaux has calculated that _Aspergillus niger_, a common mould fungus,\r\ncan break down organic substances, such as carbohydrates, at such a rate\r\nthat a metre cube of the fungus would decompose more than 3000 kilogr.\r\nof starch in a year, and this may serve as an example giving some idea\r\nof the possibilities in soil.\r\n\r\nAnalyses of waters containing large quantities of organic matter, as\r\nthey enter such open soils as those referred to, compared with the\r\ndrainage water after passing through the upper strata, show that the\r\ncarbonaceous and nitrogenous materials are broken down to more or less\r\ncompletely oxidised simpler compounds, and that the following chief\r\nchanges result. The ammonia and some other nitrogenous bodies remain\r\nbehind in the soil, as also do the phosphoric acid and much of the\r\npotash; whereas large quantities of nitric and nitrous acids, together\r\nwith much sulphuric acid, chlorides, and calcium salts pass away in the\r\ndrainage. These facts are obviously highly important in agriculture.\r\n\r\nExperiments on sewage farms have shown also that the upper soil retains\r\nmost of the bacteria of the sewage. Koch found at Osmont, near Berlin,\r\nthat whereas the different sewage waters contained numbers so enormous\r\nthat each cubic centimeter probably held 38,000,000 germs, the different\r\ndrainage waters held only 87,000 per c.cm.; and the whole process of\r\nwater-filtration through sandy soils depends on these well-known facts.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments in connection with soil-filtration, however, bring\r\nout the further facts that the oxidations which organic matters undergo\r\nin the soil--and without which they are useless to the higher\r\nplants--are enormously enfeebled if the upper layers of soil are\r\nsterilised, so as to deprive them of the myriads of aerobic bacteria,\r\nfungi and yeasts which they normally contain, and there can no longer be\r\nany doubt as to the importance of the biology of the soil in connection\r\nwith the preparation of materials suitable for absorption in solution by\r\nthe root-hairs of agricultural and other plants.\r\n\r\nThe researches of the last ten years have brought to light a long list\r\nof forms, comprising yeasts, such as Hansen's _Saccharomyces\r\napiculatus_, fungi and bacteria which live and grow in the soil, finding\r\ntheir water and food supplies in the interstices, and under conditions\r\nwhich we now know to be very diverse. They are usually more numerous, in\r\nspecies and individuals, in cultivated farm and garden soils than in\r\nwoods, prairies, and untilled lands; but the geological nature of the\r\nstrata, the closeness and otherwise of the soil, its damp or dry\r\ncharacter and its average temperature (which depends on many things\r\nbesides latitude or altitude) and other factors co-operate to rule their\r\ndistribution and numbers. The fact that cultivated land is so well\r\nsupplied with manures, air, etc., is of great importance in relation to\r\ntheir relative abundance there, and it is extremely probable that the\r\nuse of artificial manures lessens their numbers considerably as compared\r\nwith land on which stable and other animal manures are employed.\r\n\r\nA list of the soil-bacteria which have been isolated and more or less\r\ncarefully cultivated and examined would comprise about fifty species;\r\nbut it is certain that, as at present classified and named, many more\r\nspecies are to be discovered in any ordinary soil.\r\n\r\nThe fungi are apparently even more numerous than the bacteria, and we\r\nmay rest satisfied for the present with the general statement that the\r\nlife-actions of the myriads of individuals of these organisms in the\r\nsoil completely alter the question of soil-water as understood by the\r\nlast generation of agriculturalists.\r\n\r\nBut there is another aspect of this question of soil-organisms which has\r\ngrown in importance of late to such an extent that we are more than ever\r\njustified in regarding the biology of soil as far more vital to the\r\ninterests of the plant than its physical or chemical properties. With\r\nmany of the fungi in the soil the roots of plants have to compete--just\r\nas plant competes with plant--for water, salts, and other\r\nfood-materials. The toadstools which are so conspicuous in fields and\r\nforests spring from mycelia which ramify in the ground, and are busily\r\nbreaking down the remains of other organisms, and just such fungi are\r\nknown to store up relatively large quantities of salts of potassium and\r\nphosphorus--the very salts which are so valuable to crops and occur so\r\nsparingly in most soils, but which the extensively spread fungus mycelia\r\ncan gradually accumulate. Some of these fungi, moreover, are more active\r\nin their antagonism, and actually attack and pierce the roots as\r\ndestructive parasites, but I pass these by for the present, as they form\r\nthe subject for further consideration when we come to the diseases of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the competition of fungi with root-hairs for mineral\r\nsalts, oxygen, etc., may be at times acute, and it is extremely probable\r\nthat cases of so-called sterility of soil, where a particular soil is\r\nfound unsuitable for a crop, may sometimes be due to this\r\nover-competition.\r\n\r\nThe researches of recent years, however, and especially those of Frank,\r\nWinogradsky, Hellriegel, and Stahl, have brought to light a series of\r\nrelationships between certain of these soil-organisms and the higher\r\nplants which place the matter of soil-biology in quite new lights.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand it has been discovered that groups of bacteria are the\r\nactive agents in bringing about the destruction of organic nitrogenous\r\nmatter with the formation of ammonia, in oxidising this ammonia to\r\nnitrous and to nitric acids, which combine with bases in the soil to\r\nform the corresponding salts; while, on the other hand, other forms can\r\ndecompose the nitrates and reduce them to nitrites, or set free ammonia\r\nor even nitrogen from them. Moreover, there are certain species which\r\ncan fix the free nitrogen of the atmosphere, and start the cycle of\r\nup-building of this inert element into the complex higher compounds we\r\nterm organic. It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of these\r\nprocesses of nitrification and denitrification going on in the soil\r\nabout the root-hairs of the higher plants.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to this circulation of nitrogen in the soil, it\r\nturns out that the life-actions of bacteria, and not mere chemical\r\ndecompositions, are largely responsible for the circulation of\r\ncarbon, of iron, of sulphur and other elements formed from the\r\ndecomposition--also by bacterial and fungal agency--of animal and\r\nvegetable remains in the soil.\r\n\r\nEven more startling are the biological relations in the soil between\r\nthe absorbing roots of the higher plants and some of these bacteria and\r\nfungi, for it has now been established beyond all doubt that certain\r\nfungi enter the living roots and there flourish not as mere destructive\r\nparasites, but as messmates not only tolerated by the plant, but even\r\nindispensable to its welfare. It is probable that nearly half the plants\r\nof our fields, moors, and forests entertain such fungi in their\r\nroot-tissues. The curious, and long-known nodules on the roots of\r\nleguminous plants--peas, beans, clover, etc.--are filled with bacteria\r\nwhich enable these plants to avail themselves of the free nitrogen of\r\nthe air, and so enrich the soil with nitrogenous substances.\r\n\r\nThe roots of most forest trees, orchids, and plants of the moorlands,\r\nmeadows and marshes are similarly occupied by fungi, which in some way\r\nconvey salts--probably especially phosphates and potassium compounds--to\r\nthe plant in return for the small tax of organic carbon-compounds it\r\nexacts from the latter. In some cases at any rate, as Bernard has lately\r\nshown, the very existence of the plant depends on its seedling roots\r\nobtaining this advantageous attachment and co-operation (symbiosis) of\r\nthe fungus immediately on germination.\r\n\r\nThese remarks must suffice to illustrate this part of my subject, and to\r\nemphasise the statement that the question whether a given plant can be\r\ngrown in a given soil, is by no means one of simply the physical and\r\nchemical constitution of the latter. The plant will have to run the\r\ngauntlet of a long series of vicissitudes brought about by the presence\r\nor absence, relative proportions and vigour, and specific nature of the\r\norganisms in the soil at its roots, and it is easy to see that many\r\ncases of disease may be due to the absence of advantageous bacteria or\r\nfungi, or to circumstances which disfavour their life, as well as to the\r\npredominance of competing organisms.\r\n\r\nIt will now be evident that the old points of view must be abandoned,\r\nand with them, especially, the widely prevalent notion that chemical\r\nanalyses of the plant and soil can explain the real problems of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nIt was of course an enormous advance in the science when, thanks to the\r\nsplendid labours of the chemists, at the end of the last century and the\r\nbeginning of this, we obtained that preliminary knowledge of the\r\nconstitution of the air, and of the composition of the water, acids and\r\nsalts, etc., which plants require for their food-materials and\r\nlife-processes. Much was gained by De Saussure's establishment of the\r\nfact of oxygen respiration, though we now understand by the term\r\nsomething very different from, and much more complex than, what he\r\nunderstood by it, as, also, much had been gained by the previously\r\nacquired knowledge of the gas-exchanges in carbon-assimilation: nor must\r\nwe forget the services of those who proved, by laborious analyses,\r\ncontinued for long periods, what chemical compounds are found in the\r\ntissues of plants, and in the soils at their roots and the atmosphere\r\nwhich surrounded them. We must also remember many other contributions\r\nwhich have been furnished, and are still being furnished by the chemist;\r\nand I for one hope that his labours will continue to go hand in hand\r\nwith those of the physiologist.\r\n\r\nBut, when all due honour is paid to the scientific chemist, it must\r\nstill be allowed that his problems are different from the real problems\r\nof agriculture. To take one set of instances alone. The chemist can\r\nanalyse a given soil or a given manure, and can even go a long way\r\ntowards making them, but his analyses do not tell us what conditions are\r\nnecessary in order that their ingredients may be presented to the roots\r\nso as to be absorbed and become built up into the plant. Chemistry told\r\nus that carbon was fixed from the air, but physiological experiments\r\ndetermined how this meant the synthesis of certain definite\r\ncarbohydrates--this, too, in the face of the powerful authority of the\r\nchemist Liebig, who supposed that the vegetable acids were the results\r\nof the assimilation of carbon. Wolff, De Saussure, and other chemists\r\nhave done yeoman service in showing that different plants, growing in\r\nthe same soil, contain different proportions of mineral substances; but\r\nit was by means of water-cultures, and other physiological researches,\r\nsuch as those of Pfeffer on osmotic phenomena and of Schwarz and Molisch\r\non root-hairs, that the puzzling question of selective absorption, by\r\nmeans of the living root-hairs, came into the arena of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn every case--and, as already said, I am not undervaluing the work\r\ndone--the chemist has left us only on the threshold of the real\r\nproblem. He has stood outside the factory in which the real work we want\r\nto know about is being carried on, and has told us of so many tons of\r\nthis material being carried in at the gates, and of so many tons of that\r\ncoming out; he has even burnt down the factory, and all its contents and\r\nmachinery, and has then told us how many tons of the various materials\r\nwere there at the time; but this is not what we want, valuable as the\r\ninformation is, and still more will be. What we want, and what we expect\r\nto obtain, is more information regarding what is done with the materials\r\nin the factory: what machinery they are put into, and how they are put\r\nin: what stages they go through, and how the stages follow one another:\r\nwhat wear and tear has to be endured, and how we can step in and stop\r\nthe working of the machine for our own benefit at the best possible\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe physiologist proceeds empirically, by experimenting with the living\r\nmachinery. He recognises the parts and their structure, and tries to\r\nfind out what they are doing: he knows that the laws of physics and\r\nchemistry cannot be traversed, but he sees these laws at work under\r\nspecial and very complex and peculiar conditions. He therefore, as the\r\nresults of his experiments, sets new questions--or old questions under\r\nnew conditions, if you like--and undoubtedly wants the help of both\r\nchemist and physicist; or, if it is preferred, the chemist and physicist\r\nmay attack the problems, but they must familiarise themselves with the\r\npeculiar mechanism of the organism concerned, and cannot hope to attain\r\nsuccess without experimenting with it. I confess it seems to me as\r\nreasonable to look upon scientific agriculture as a branch chiefly of\r\nchemistry as it would be to look upon horse-breeding or pigeon-rearing\r\nfrom the same point of view; and why the professed chemist's advice is\r\nregarded as so comforting and final in the one case and not in the other\r\nis one of those mysteries which seem inherent in human nature.\r\n\r\nThe central point in agriculture is the plant: get the most out of\r\nit--the energy-winning machine which alone can keep the animals and\r\neverything else connected with the farm going--and all the rest follows.\r\nThe old agriculture has taken a gloomy view of things, and especially on\r\naccount of a large variable which it blames for many ills, namely, the\r\nseason or climate. Perhaps the old agriculture has not sufficiently\r\nrecognised that Nature grows plants in accordance with the fact that\r\nvariation is not peculiar to the weather: if the seasons vary, so do\r\nfruit and other produce and the plants which yield them; and since man\r\ncannot hope to control the one variable, possibly relief will be found\r\nin doing more, within his limits, towards controlling others.\r\n\r\nIn any case he cannot hope to succeed without study of the physiology of\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     An admirable short account of soil in its relation to\r\n     root-hairs is given in Sachs' _Lectures_, XV.; but for a more\r\n     exhaustive treatment of the subject of soil the reader is\r\n     referred to King, _The Soil_ (Wisconsin, 1895), or Warrington,\r\n     _Lectures on the Physical Properties of Soil_ (Oxford, 1900);\r\n     Larbaletrier, _L'Agriculture_ (Paris, 1888), chapters II. and\r\n     III. There is also a very good account in Bailey, _The\r\n     Principles of Agriculture_ (London, 1898), chapters I.-III.\r\n\r\n     With reference to the organisms in soils and the\r\n     decompositions they bring about, the student should consult\r\n     Kramer, _Die Bakteriologie in ihren Beziehungen zur\r\n     Landwirthschaft_ (Wien, 1890), and Lafar, _Technical Mycology_\r\n     (Engl. edition, 1898), sections V., VIII., and IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHYBRIDISATION AND SELECTION.\r\n\r\n     _The crossing of varieties of wheat, etc.--The essentials of\r\n     fertilisation--Rimpau's experiments--Hybrids and selected\r\n     varieties._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the more hopeful view of the case which the new agriculture will have\r\nto take, it will recognise the physiological truth that since the living\r\nplant is the important and variable machine which constructs the produce\r\nlooked for, and since that machine will work best in proportion as its\r\nneeds are properly satisfied; therefore in cases where the needs of a\r\ngiven type of the machine cannot be efficiently provided for, it will be\r\nwell to select some other type which will take what supplies and\r\nconditions can be offered. Of course, this is already recognised to a\r\ncertain extent, as is implied in the practices of \"rotation of crops,\"\r\nselection of \"pedigree wheats\" and mixtures of \"pasture grasses,\" and in\r\ndecisions as to the quality of land according to the kinds of weeds\r\nfound on it, and so forth; but I am convinced that the agriculturist of\r\nthe future--and the same applies to the horticulturist, planter and\r\nforester--will have to concern himself more systematically with the\r\nworking and the variability of the plant, and particularly with what\r\nDarwin termed Variation under Domestication, than has always been the\r\ncustom in the past. The subject of the plasticity of cultivated plants,\r\nand especially of hybrids, is in one sense an old one; but much work is\r\nbeing done which proves, as such work is apt to do, that very much more\r\nmay be done by well-planned experiments on the selection of new\r\nvarieties raised by hybridising and cultivation.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this point, a short summary of some of the results of\r\ncrossing different species of wheat, barley, oats, peas, beet, etc., may\r\nserve to show what has been gained and what may be hoped for in these\r\ndirections. It should be stated that much has been done and is being\r\ndone in this country as well as abroad, as witness English varieties of\r\ncorn, peas, and potatoes, and the recent experiments on crossing various\r\nkinds of maize in America.\r\n\r\nThe hybridiser grows his cereals, etc., in pots until ready for\r\ncrossing, and then takes them into the laboratory, removes the weaker\r\nspikelets, and takes out the young stamens from the flowers left on the\r\nplant. The female plant is then ready, and the flowers covered with\r\npaper caps. The pollen, obtained by a clean wet brush from the plant\r\nchosen as the father, is then carefully placed in position on the\r\nstigmas, and the caps replaced. The pollination is repeated\r\noccasionally, and care taken that no uncrossed flowers develop later. In\r\nthis way a few seeds or grains are got to start with.\r\n\r\nThis would be the place to introduce an account of the enormous advances\r\nmade by the botanists of the last decade or two in the study of the\r\nmicroscopic phenomena of fertilisation. Without going into\r\ndetails--which would more than occupy all the space at command--I may\r\nrecall the discoveries of Strasburger and his pupils, and of Guignard,\r\nwhich have supplemented the earlier discoveries of De Bary, Cohn, and\r\nHofmeister, by establishing the facts that the essential point in\r\nfertilisation is the fusion of two nuclei, and the bringing together in\r\nthe fused mass of two extremely minute thread-like coiled bodies, the\r\nso-called chromatosomes or filaments, one of which is derived from the\r\nmale and the other from the female parent. The particulars as to the\r\nmarvellous adaptations to secure the union of these two infinitesimally\r\nminute threads, their behaviour immediately before and after union, and\r\nmany other points must be passed over, as I have only space to emphasise\r\nthe one crowning discovery that these tiny filaments of nuclear\r\nsubstance are the material carriers of all the hereditary properties of\r\nthe parents to the young plant which their union initiates.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the above statements are based on any\r\nmeagre foundation of facts. The attraction of the fusing nucleated\r\nmasses had been demonstrated over and over again by Tulasne, De Bary,\r\nStrasburger and others; but Pfeffer brought the matter to a crisis by\r\ndiscovering the attractive (chemotactic) substance emitted in given\r\ncases, and by collecting the fertilising bodies by its means into\r\nartificial tubes.\r\n\r\nThe fusion of the nucleated bodies in the sexual act was observed by\r\nStrasburger in the living plant a few years ago, and numerous later\r\nobservers have confirmed it. Meanwhile all the stages of approach and\r\ncontact of the essential filaments of the nuclear substance have been\r\ntraced, as also all the stages of the transference of half of each\r\nfilament, male and female, into each of the first two cells of the very\r\nyoung embryo-plant.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the essentials are found to be the same in the animal kingdom\r\nalso, and the bearing of all these discoveries on the phenomena of\r\nreproduction, variation, and heredity in living organisms has been and\r\nis of the highest importance, for they support, control, explain and\r\ncorrect so many of the splendid results of Knight, Koelreuter, Sprengel,\r\nHildebrand and Hermann Mueller, and in every direction throw side-lights\r\ninto the crevices of that magnificent structure, the theory of Natural\r\nSelection, erected for all time by our countryman, Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\nTo return now to experiments on crossing. It is found that the first\r\nproducts of the crossing appear exactly alike; they may have characters\r\nintermediate between those of the father and mother, or they may\r\nresemble one more than the other, but all the seeds of the same cross\r\ndo it in the same way.\r\n\r\nOn then sowing the seeds of the plants produced from this first cross,\r\nvariations begin to appear. Most of the progeny revert to one or other\r\nof the parent forms, others show all conceivable combinations of their\r\ncharacters, and a few may give rise to entirely new characters. In\r\nsucceeding generations the reversions are preponderant, and, supposing\r\nno care is taken to prevent it, the whole of the offspring gradually go\r\nback to the ancestral type.\r\n\r\nSome important consequences result, however, if systematic care is\r\nbrought to bear on the matter. This tendency to variation in the second\r\ngeneration of crossed plants has often been noted, and it bears out very\r\ndistinctly the conclusions to which Darwin came.\r\n\r\nThe hybridiser takes advantage of this variation, as others have done,\r\nto select some forms and rigidly suppress others, in order to obtain\r\nwell-marked varieties of the plants he experiments with. In\r\nillustration, I may take the following from Rimpau's account of his\r\nexperiments on crossing wheat: By crossing a white English long-eared,\r\ndense wheat, and celebrated as a heavy cropper, with a red, looser\r\nGerman wheat, remarkable for its resistance to winter cold, Rimpau hoped\r\nto obtain a variety uniting both the above qualities. As regards the\r\nproperty of resistance, he failed, and he eventually gave up the\r\nattempts in face of the advantages offered by the so-called\r\n_Square-heads_, which then came into the market. His experiments, even\r\nwith the above varieties, are worth noting, however, for they show how\r\npromising the results of carefully conducted crossing and selection may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe crossing was done in 1875, in both directions. In 1876 the few\r\ngrains obtained were found to yield plants almost all alike, with the\r\nlong loose ear of the German parent, but the paler colour of the English\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the plants, obtained by sowing the finest grains, were found to\r\nconsist of pure white, pure red, and of forms which appeared to vary and\r\nrevert in all possible degrees as regards colour, density, and other\r\ncharacters intermediate between these.\r\n\r\nBy carefully separating the closest and densest white wheats from the\r\nclosest and densest red ones, he got in 1878 a large number of each\r\ncoming nearer to the type sown than did the mongrel forms intermingled\r\nwith them: these reversions and intermediate forms were then rigidly\r\neliminated, and only the deepest coloured and densest red and white\r\nforms again sown.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 these two chosen varieties were constant, so far as concerned\r\nthose selected from the crossing of female English white with male\r\nGerman red wheat, and the following year proved the constancy of the red\r\nvariety in the reciprocal cross. In 1886 all four varieties--_i.e._ the\r\ntwo reds and the two whites of both the crossings--had become constant.\r\n\r\nStill more instructive are the results of the cross between the same\r\nwhite English non-bearded wheat and a red German bearded wheat.\r\n\r\nThe first results of the crossing in 1875 showed the loose ear of the\r\nGerman mother, but was paler in colour; while the influence of the\r\nEnglish father was shown by the absence of beard.\r\n\r\nFrom the reversions and mixtures of the mongrels showing reminiscences\r\nof the parents in all degrees in 1877, rigid selections and re-sowings\r\nwere made as before, and Rimpau eventually got four very distinct\r\nvarieties, two red and two white, a bearded and a beardless form of\r\neach, and these were declared fixed and constant in 1879-1882.\r\n\r\nPassing over many similar results, and merely noting a very successful\r\nvariety got from a cross between a very early ripening loose red\r\nAmerican wheat and the dense heavy cropping English Square-head--the\r\ncrossed variety which has proved very suitable for certain light soils\r\nand dry climates on the Continent, which demand very rapid ripening, and\r\nare therefore of great physiological and technical interest--I must pass\r\non to note the curious result of the successful hybridisation of wheat\r\nand rye. This cross has been effected several times, and first in this\r\ncountry according to reports from Edinburgh (1875), New York (1886), and\r\nelsewhere, and Rimpau's careful experiments seem to leave no doubt on\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nFirst I must remind you that wheat (_Triticum_) differs from rye\r\n(_Secale_) in several marked characters, such as the breadth and shape\r\nof the glumes, the number of flowers in the spikelet, etc.; and that the\r\ncultivated rye differs from cultivated wheats in the characters of the\r\nstraw, in having long ears, and in its flowering glumes remaining widely\r\ndivaricated for some days when in flower.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Rimpau removed the young stamens from the German wheat referred\r\nto, and pollinated the stigmas with pollen from a long-eared rye. Four\r\nsound grains were obtained, looking like wheat-grains.\r\n\r\nThe history of one of these grains was as follows: In 1889 it yielded\r\nears which were peculiarly narrow and long, and its stalks were also\r\nmuch longer than the wheat: the flowers remained exposed, with widely\r\nopen paleae, for several days, and the grains were very peculiar, though\r\nwheat-like.\r\n\r\nFifteen of the best grains were selected, and in 1890 three of the\r\nresulting plants proved to be a wheat of the Square-head type and one\r\nquite sterile. The others retained the elongated, narrow, brownish-red\r\nears, the flowering glumes again opening wide for some days. This last\r\nis a characteristic of rye, but not of wheat.\r\n\r\nA long series of natural hybrids of wheat, barley, and oats are also\r\ndescribed and discussed by Rimpau, as well as artificial crosses--some\r\nvery remarkable--of barleys, but they must be passed over here.\r\n\r\nPeas rarely become hybridised naturally. According to Darwin, H. Mueller,\r\nand Focke, the flowers are little visited by insects in our countries,\r\nthough the mechanism points to their adaptation for pollination by large\r\nbees.\r\n\r\nRimpau confirms Darwin, H. Mueller, and Ogle as to the self-fertilisation\r\nof our cultivated peas. Nevertheless, as is well known, marked varieties\r\nhave been obtained by artificial crossing by Gaertner, Knight, Laxton,\r\nand others, especially in this country.\r\n\r\nAt the same time experiments show that while it is very easy to obtain\r\nartificial hybrids of such plants, and there is no fear of natural\r\ninter-crossing, the forms are remarkably unstable as yet. Similarly\r\nunsatisfactory results were obtained with beet. As experiments are still\r\ngoing on, however, we may expect to hear more about these and other\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, from recent experiments by De Vries, Correns, and\r\nothers, that a remarkable regularity, expressed by Mendel in the form of\r\na law, obtains in the variations which result from hybridising.\r\n\r\nIn considering these illustrative cases, it is necessary to thoroughly\r\napprehend that two procedures are involved. In the first place we have\r\nthe cross-pollination leading to the formation of the hybrid plant by\r\ncross-fertilisation. But experience shows that this would lead to very\r\nuncertain results if the plant-breeder did not supplement them by the\r\nsecond and extremely important process of rigid selection--_i.e._ by\r\nchoosing the best of the progeny and breeding from them apart from the\r\nparent-forms, and gradually intensifying, as it were, the variations in\r\ncertain directions which have been started by the crossing.\r\n\r\nIt is by selection, careful culture, and repeated selection that so much\r\nhas been done in obtaining the innumerable new varieties of roses,\r\nsweet-peas, orchids, orchard fruits, cereals, grapes, strawberries,\r\nmelons, tomatoes, early potatoes, etc., brought forward by numerous\r\nbreeders of plants in all countries, as will readily be understood if\r\nreference be made to the work of Hays and Webber in America; Saunders in\r\nCanada; Garton, Sutton, Veitch, Bateson, and others in this country.\r\n\r\nNor is it necessary that the new materials for selection to work upon\r\nshould be started by hybridisation. Grafting, change of conditions, and\r\neven variations so vaguely understood that we term them \"spontaneous,\"\r\nmay supply the starting-points for changes in the characters of plants,\r\nso remarkable after intensification by breeding that people find it\r\ndifficult to believe they can have come from one stock.\r\n\r\nHere, however, I must conclude, merely remarking that the above sketch\r\nis a mere outline of the subjects modern agriculture and horticulture\r\nconcern themselves with. There are hundreds of problems connected with\r\nthe germination of seeds, on which valuable recent work has been done by\r\nKlebs, Green, Horace Brown, and others; with the resistance of seeds\r\nand seedlings to high and low temperatures, a subject opened out by\r\nSachs, Kny, De Vries, Krasan, Just, Hoehnel, Dewar, Dyer, and others;\r\nwith the conditions of vegetation which affect the various functions of\r\ngrowth, respiration, assimilation, transpiration, and so forth, on which\r\nI cannot even touch in these pages.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I hope I have succeeded in impressing upon you the grand fact\r\nthat the plant is a living and very complex engine, driven by the\r\nradiant energy of the sun, and capable of doing work thereby, and this\r\njust as truly as any heat-engine is driven by chemical energy gained by\r\nmeans of the sun's rays, or as a water-mill is driven by power which\r\nmust be referred to the energy of potential in the head of water placed\r\nin position by the sun's work in evaporation. Fundamentally the whole of\r\nlife and work on our planet is to be referred to the one great source of\r\nenergy which renders possible the establishment of differences of\r\npotential.\r\n\r\nThis machine, then, doing work in various ways, adapts itself--or goes\r\nto the wall--to the conditions of its work among competing organisms or\r\nopposing circumstances. Curiously enough, while in some cases it suffers\r\nfrom the competition, in others it is benefited by its life-actions\r\nfitting in between those of other organisms, which in their turn\r\nsupplement it. In other words new types of this engine, capable of doing\r\nthe work in various ways, are obtainable; some are good types for the\r\nconditions afforded, others are bad ones.\r\n\r\nExamples of both will occur in the further exposition of the subject.\r\n\r\nMan's position in regard to the struggle is that of an intelligent being\r\nwho steps in at certain stages and protects, fosters, and in every way\r\nfavours the agricultural plant--the living machine--and sees that every\r\nopportunity is given it to do its best work in the best way--from his\r\npoints of view!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     The foundation of any course of reading on hybridisation\r\n     and selection should be Darwin's _Effects of Cross and\r\n     Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom_, which, with his\r\n     books _On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection_\r\n     and _The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication_,\r\n     will prepare the student for the long course of reading\r\n     necessary for a full appreciation of what has been done in\r\n     this department of science.\r\n\r\n     From the numerous works which followed these I should select\r\n     Bailey's _Survival of the Unlike_, London, 1896, and\r\n     _Evolution of our Native Fruits_, New York, 1898, as\r\n     especially useful for the reader of this book, to which may\r\n     also be added _Plant Breeding_, New York, 1896, by the same\r\n     author, as giving numerous facts and practical directions of\r\n     value. Further, the \"Hybrid Conference Report,\" _Journ. Roy.\r\n     Hort. Soc._, 1900, abounds in facts and information. Rimpau,\r\n     _Landw. Jahrb._, vol. xx., 1891, p. 239. The student who\r\n     wishes to get towards the root of the matter will hardly be\r\n     able to dispense with Strasburger's _Neue Untersuchungen ueber\r\n     die Befruchtungsvorgang bei den Phanerogamen_, Jena, 1884. An\r\n     interesting summary of recent work on _Xenia_ and \"double\r\n     fertilisation\" will be found in _Bull. No. 22, U.S. Dept. of\r\n     Agric._, 1900. See also _Nature_, Mar. 15, 1900, p. 470.\r\n\r\n     If he wishes to explore the vast region of controversial\r\n     literature that opens up from these points, and which is far\r\n     beyond the purpose of this book, he may consult the literature\r\n     collected in Kassowitz' _Allgemeine Biologie_, Wien, 1899, B.\r\n     II., and the references in the works quoted; also,\r\n     Strasburger, \"The Periodic Reduction of Chromosomes in Living\r\n     Organisms,\" _Ann.

DERIVATION AND MEANING.\r\n\r\n     _History. References in the Bible--Greeks and Romans--\r\n     Shakespeare--Rouen law--Superstitions--Malpighi and Grew--\r\n     Hales--Unger--Berkeley--De Bary, etc. Physiology and Biology\r\n     --Diagnosis--Etiology--Therapeutics. Study of causes._\r\n\r\n\r\nPhytopathology, from Greek words which signify to treat of diseases of\r\nplants, comprises what is known of the symptoms, course, and causes of\r\nthe diseases which threaten the lives of plants, or bring about injuries\r\nand abnormalities of structure. As a distinct and systematised branch of\r\nbotany it is a modern study, the history of which only dates from about\r\n1850, though the subject had been treated more or less disjointedly by\r\nseveral authors during the preceding century, and isolated records of\r\ndiseased crops, fruit-trees, etc., exist far back in the history of\r\nEurope. The existence of mildews and blights on cereals indeed was\r\nobserved and recorded by the writers of the older books of the Bible,\r\nhalf a dozen references to such blights being found in the Old\r\nTestament, as well as others to blasted fig trees, etc., in the New\r\nTestament. Aristotle, about 350 B.C., noticed the epidemic nature of\r\nwheat-rust. The Greeks and Romans were so well acquainted with such\r\ndiseases that their philosophers speculated very shrewdly as to causes,\r\nwhile the people dedicated such pests to special gods. As regards the\r\nMiddle Ages, we know little beyond the fact that blights and mildews\r\nexisted, but Shakespeare's reference in _King Lear_ (Act III., Sc. 4)\r\nleaves no doubt as to his acquaintance with mildew in the 17th century,\r\nand other authorities bear out the same. Even the law took cognisance of\r\nthe danger of wheat-rust in 1660 in Rouen (Loverdo). Prior to the 18th\r\ncentury, however, only meagre notes on the subject occur scattered here\r\nand there among other matters, and much superstition existed then and\r\nlater regarding these as other diseases.\r\n\r\nMalpighi, in 1679, gave excellent figures of leaves rolled by insects\r\nand of numerous galls, the true nature of which he practically\r\ndiscovered by observing the insect piercing the tissues; previous\r\nobservers--Pliny knew that flies emerge from galls, but thought the\r\nlatter grew spontaneously--having nothing but superstitions and\r\nconjectures to offer. Grew, in 1682, also gave a capital figure and\r\ndescription of a leaf mined by \"a small flat insect . . . which neither\r\nranging in breadth nor striking deep into the leaf, eats so much only\r\nas lies just before it, and so runs scudding along betwixt the skin and\r\nthe pulp of the leaf, leaving a whitish streak behind it, where the skin\r\nis now loose, as the measure of its voyage\"--a by no means inadequate\r\ndescription of the injury and its cause.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century several academic treatises or\r\ndissertations dealing with diseases of plants appeared.\r\n\r\nBut as a rule we only find disjointed notes. Hales (1727-33) discusses\r\nthe rotting of wounds, canker, and a few other matters, but much had to\r\nbe done with the microscope ere any substantial progress could be made.\r\n\r\nWith the nineteenth century, and the founding of the modern theories of\r\nnutrition by Ingenhousz, Priestley, and De Saussure, we find a new era\r\nstarted. As the discoveries of the microscopists continued to build up\r\nour knowledge of the anatomy of plants and began to elucidate the\r\nbiology of the fungi and other cryptogams, while the chemists and\r\nphysiologists laid the foundations of our modern science of plant life,\r\nit gradually became possible to tabulate and classify plant diseases,\r\nand discuss their symptoms and causes in a more scientific manner. Even\r\nin 1833, however, Turpin, and a far better observer, Unger, regarded\r\nparasitic fungi as due to diseased outgrowths of chlorophyll-corpuscles\r\nand parenchyma cells, views shared by Meyen (1837) and Schleiden (1846).\r\nWe may pass over the various treatises of Wiegmann (1839), Meyen (1841),\r\nRaspail (1846), Kuehn (1859), and a number of other works of the period,\r\nmerely referring with emphasis to Berkeley's admirable papers in the\r\n_Gardener's Chronicle_ (1854) for a summary of what was then known. All\r\nthese works antedate De Bary's _Morphologie und Physiologie der Pilze,\r\netc._ (1866), in which he brought together the results of his researches\r\nduring the decade, proving the real nature of parasitic diseases and\r\ninfection as worked out by experiments between 1853 and 1863.\r\n\r\nThis work put the whole subject of parasitic diseases of plants and\r\nanimals on a new footing, and paved the way for the modern treatment of\r\nplant pathology as elaborated in the treatises of Frank (1880 and 1895),\r\nSorauer (1886), Kirchner (1890), and others, to which the reader is\r\nreferred for further details. I will merely quote the following passage\r\nfrom Raspail's _Histoire Naturelle de la Sante et de la Maladie_, 1846\r\n(vol. ii., p. 176), in illustration of the views entertained by high\r\nauthorities just prior to De Bary's work: \"L'insecte qui produit les\r\n_erineum_, _uredo_, _aecidium_, _xyloma_, _puccinia_, n'est donc plus\r\npour nous un insecte inconnu, mais un _acarus_ (grise), un _aphis_\r\n(puceron) ou un _thrips_, qui produit au printemps une deviation, etc.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this view, that fungi already well known to mycologists were called\r\nforth by the punctures of insects, was regarded as not out of harmony\r\nwith the idea that the fungus itself was an abnormal outgrowth of the\r\ntissues of the host.\r\n\r\nThe proper study of plant pathology presupposes and involves a knowledge\r\nof the physiology of plants, of the normal relations of the latter to\r\ntheir environment, and of the biology of those animals and plants\r\n(principally insects and fungi) which are parasitic on them. It is of\r\nthe first importance to understand that a disease is a condition of\r\nabnormal physiology, and that the boundary lines between health and\r\nill-health are vague and difficult to define. As with the study of the\r\ndiseases of man and other animals, so with those of plants, the practice\r\nresolves itself into the accurate observation and interpretation of\r\nsymptoms (_Diagnosis_) on the one hand, and of causes (_Aetiology_) on\r\nthe other, before any conclusions of value can be drawn as to preventive\r\nor remedial measures (_Therapeutics_). In plants, however, symptoms of\r\ndisease are apt to exhibit themselves in a very general manner, or at\r\nany rate it may be that our perceptions of them differentiate symptoms\r\ndue to very different reactions imperfectly, probably because the\r\norganisation of the plant is less specialised than that of animals. The\r\nturning yellow and premature falling of leaves, for instance, is a\r\nfrequent symptom of disease; but it may be due to a long series of\r\ndifferent causes of ill-health--_e.g._ drought, too high or too low a\r\ntemperature, light of insufficient or of excessive intensity, a\r\nsuperfluity of water at the roots, the presence in the tissues of\r\nparasitic fungi, or that of worms or insects at the roots or elsewhere,\r\npoisonous gases in the air, soil, etc., and so forth. Consequently the\r\nscience of plant pathology is much concerned with the direct action of\r\nexternal causes, which are probably less obscure than in the case of\r\nanimals, though by no means always obvious. Such considerations at any\r\nrate seem to account for the fact that most authorities on plant\r\npathology base their classification on the causes of disease, there\r\nbeing few noteworthy exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n     The bibliography here quoted will be found in Berkeley,\r\n     \"Vegetable Pathology,\" _Gardener's Chronicle_, 1854, p. 4;\r\n     Plowright, _British Uredineae and Ustilagineae_, 1889; Eriksson\r\n     and Henning, _Die Getreideroste_, Stockholm, 1896; De Bary,\r\n     _Comparative Morphology and Biology of the Fungi_, etc., 1887;\r\n     Frank, _Die Krankheiten der Pflanzen_, 1895-96, and scattered\r\n     in the works referred to in them and in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND DISEASE.\r\n\r\n     _Variation--Disease--Comparison to a top. Health--Extinction\r\n     of species--Natural demise. Examples of complex interactions\r\n     in health--Interference, and tendencies to ill-health._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we come to enquire into the causes of disease, it appears at first\r\nan obvious and easy plan to subdivide them into groups of factors which\r\ninterfere with the normal physiology of the plant. Scientific experience\r\nshows, however, that the easy and the obvious are here, as elsewhere in\r\nnature, only apparent, for disease, like health, is an extremely complex\r\nphenomenon, involving many reactions and interactions between the plant\r\nand its environment. If we agree that a living plant in a state of\r\nhealth is not a fixed and unaltering thing, but is ever varying and\r\nundergoing adaptive changes as its life works out its labyrinthine\r\ncourse through the vicissitudes of the also ever-varying environment,\r\nthen we cannot escape the conviction that a diseased plant, so long as\r\nit lives, is also varying in response to the environment. The principal\r\ndifference between the two cases is, that whereas the normal healthy\r\nplant varies more or less regularly and rhythmically about a mean, the\r\ndiseased one is tending to vary too suddenly or too far in some\r\nparticular directions from the mean; the healthy plant may, for our\r\npresent purposes, be roughly likened to a properly balanced top spinning\r\nregularly and well, whereas the diseased one is lurching here, or\r\nwobbling there, to the great danger of its stability. For we must\r\nrecognise at the outset that disease is but variation in directions\r\ndangerous to the life of the plant. Health consists in variation also,\r\nbut not in such dangerous grooves. That the passage from health to\r\ndisease is gradual and ill-defined in many cases will readily be seen.\r\nIn fact we cannot completely define disease. Mere abnormality of form,\r\ncolour, size, etc., is not necessarily a sign of disease, in the usual\r\nsense of the word, otherwise the striking variations of our cultivated\r\nplants would suggest gloomy thoughts indeed, whereas we have reason to\r\nbelieve that many cultivated varieties are more healthy--in the sense of\r\nresisting dangerous exigencies of the environment--than the stocks they\r\ncame from. Strictly speaking, no two buds on a fruit-tree are alike, and\r\nthe shoots they produce vary in position, exposure, number, and vigour\r\nof leaves, and so forth. The minute variations here referred to are not\r\nseen by the ordinary observer, but those who bud, graft and multiply by\r\ncuttings on a large scale know that such bud-variations are important,\r\nquite apart from more extensive \"sports\" which occasionally occur.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have reason to believe that many species have died\r\nout gradually as the environment altered. These plants died because they\r\ndid not vary sufficiently, or did not vary in the right directions; they\r\nbecame diseased with respect to the then prevailing conditions of normal\r\nphysiology or health.\r\n\r\nDisease, therefore, may be said to be variation of functions in\r\ndirections, or to extents, which threaten the life of the plant, the\r\nnormal in all cases being the state of the plant characteristic of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nEven now, however, we have not obtained a complete definition, because,\r\nsince all plants die sooner or later, we have not excluded the natural\r\ndemise of the individual or its parts, and no one would call the\r\nautumnal fall of leaves, or the withering of an annual after flowering,\r\ndeath from disease. Clearly then the idea of disease implies danger of\r\npremature death, and probably this is as near as we shall get to a\r\nsatisfactory definition. Since this matter is of primary importance for\r\nour present theme, I will add the following instances for consideration.\r\n\r\nA plant in perfect health and in the fullest exercise of all its\r\nfunctions, has its roots in a soil which is suitably warmed and aerated,\r\ncontains the right quantities of water which dissolve just the proper\r\nproportions of all the essential mineral salts, but nothing poisonous,\r\nwhile the soil itself has a texture such that the roots and root-hairs\r\ncan extend and do their utmost in absorbing.\r\n\r\nThe leaves above are exposed to just the right intensity of light, in\r\nair which is not too dry, and is of suitable temperature and\r\ncomposition, containing no poisonous exhalations, etc.; and as the\r\nfoliage is gently moved by the breeze, it manufactures carbohydrates at\r\nthe optimum rate in the chlorophyll, and the so-called \"elaborated sap\"\r\ncontaining the dissolved organic food-supplies is prepared in the\r\ntissues in maximum quantities and of just the right degrees of\r\nconcentration and quality for use in the buds, stem, roots, etc., for\r\nwhich it is destined as they draw on the supplies.\r\n\r\nBetween these assimilating organs, the leaves, and the absorbing roots,\r\nwe have in the stem the wood, with its vessels adapted in quantity and\r\ncalibre to convey the water containing dissolved salts from the\r\nabsorbing roots to the leaves (to say nothing of other parts) and,\r\nseparated from this wood by the cambium, we find the sieve-tubes and\r\ncortical tissues in suitable quantity conveying the \"elaborated\r\nsap\"--the solutions of organic food-materials from the leaves down to\r\nthe roots, up to the buds, and elsewhere. Joining these cortical and\r\nwood tissues are adapted series of medullary rays which, apart from\r\nother connections, bring about the necessary interchanges of water and\r\n\"elaborated sap\" with the cambium, the formative tissue which has to be\r\nfed and served by them, and which by its growth supplies new vessels and\r\nsieve-tubes, etc., to carry the continually increasing quantities of\r\nwater and food substances as the roots and leaves increase in number and\r\narea, and thus enables this ideally correlated system to go on working\r\nat maximum energy.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the same plant with its roots in an unsuitable soil--too dry\r\nor too poor in mineral supplies, for instance--the transpiring leaves\r\nabove cannot obtain sufficient water and salts to supply their needs,\r\nbut we will suppose hypothetically that they still assimilate under the\r\nsame ideal conditions as before. The supplies now coming to the cambium\r\nare diminished, since the want of water and minerals compels the leaves\r\nto put aside any excess of carbohydrates (_e.g._ as stored\r\nstarch-grains), and the plastic materials which do pass to the cambium\r\nso deficient in water cannot be directly utilised, and a starvation\r\nperiod sets in. Consequently the cambium forms less wood, and this will\r\ncontain fewer and smaller vessels, and so reduce the conducting\r\npassages: fewer sieve-tubes also are constructed, and the paths of the\r\nwater current and food supplies narrowed, which of course reacts on the\r\ntissues everywhere. The reserve substances may slowly be dissolved and\r\ndistributed, however, and considerable quantities be passed in course of\r\ntime into the roots, which, as opportunity offers, gradually employ them\r\nin making new roots, and if the disturbance has not gone too far and\r\nthe conditions do not become unfavourable, an increased root-supply may\r\nby its larger absorbing area gradually establish the former state of\r\nequilibrium of functions. But this at the expense of the plant, which is\r\nsmaller, has fewer leaves and narrower water channels, etc., than a\r\nplant not thus checked, and it may take a long time to make up for the\r\nloss of time and stature thus incurred. Indeed if the plant is an annual\r\nno recovery at all may occur, the reserves passing into fruit and seeds\r\ninstead of slowly supplying the roots as described.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked, can such a condition of affairs as that described really\r\noccur, we have only to think of a transplanted specimen with its roots\r\nmaimed and put into unsuitable soil, or of plants in the open with\r\nfeeding roots gnawed by an insect, etc., or of a tree hitherto in\r\nequilibrium with its fellows in a plantation suddenly set free by\r\nthinning and so forth.\r\n\r\nNow take the case where the roots are maintaining their maximum\r\nfunctional activity, but the leaves--owing to want of light, too much\r\nmoisture or too low a temperature of the air--are functionally\r\ndepressed. Here we get a state of over-saturation with water set up, the\r\ntissues are turgid to bursting point, what supplies do traverse the\r\nsieve-tubes, cortex, etc., do so slowly and are excessively diluted, and\r\nthe cambium again forms less wood, but the lumina of the vessels are\r\nlarger and the lignification less complete. Growth in length is\r\nexcessive, but more leaves are formed, though they are apt to be\r\nabnormally thin and may be small. Little or no reserves are stored\r\nanywhere, and the watery tissues contain dangerously diffusible\r\nsubstances which may render them an easy prey to parasitic fungi. Here\r\nagain, however, if the disturbance of equilibrium has not gone too far,\r\nand if the season permits, the new leaves may come into full activity\r\nand the situation be saved by transpiration and assimilation gradually\r\nincreasing and restoring the equilibrium. But, as before, the plant has\r\nsuffered, and shows the effect in its weak shoots, retarded flowering,\r\nand other ways.\r\n\r\nSuch plight as is here described may actually be attained in greenhouses\r\nwhere over-watering is the fault, and even in the open it is not\r\nuncommon in rainy summers, or in plantations where dominant trees get\r\nthe upper hand and partially shade more slowly growing species, or in\r\nfields where rank grass is allowed to overwhelm crops of lower stature.\r\n\r\nNow it will be evident that either of these typical cases of temporary\r\ndisturbance of functional equilibrium may be carried too far: in the\r\nfirst case the plant may wilt and wither, in the second it may rupture\r\nand rot, to take these eventualities only. And yet it is difficult to\r\ncall these indispositions diseases: they are rather examples of extreme\r\ndepartures from the normal standard of health, just on the borderland\r\nbetween health and disease. A step further, as it were, and disease\r\nsupervenes: certain tissues die from want of water, and a necrotic area\r\nis formed, or the cortex bursts and a wound is formed in another way, or\r\nsome fungus gets a hold, and so on. These abnormal states are\r\nparticularly apt to predispose the plant to disease--insects revel in\r\nsuch semi-wilted leaves and shoots crammed with reserves, and fungi in\r\nthe water-logged leaves of the second case, while a cold dry wind is\r\npeculiarly fatal to such tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n     The reader may consult Hartig, _Diseases of Trees_, Eng. ed.,\r\n     1894, Introduction; Sorauer, _Pflanzen Krankheiten_, pp. 1-12,\r\n     and Frank, _Die Krankheiten der Pflanzen_, B. 1, p. 5, for\r\n     definitions of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\n     _A. External causes--I. Non-living environment: soil,\r\n     atmosphere, temperature--II. Living environment: plants,\r\n     animals--Complex interactions--Predisposing causes--No one\r\n     factor works alone--Tangled problems of natural selection\r\n     involved. B. So-called internal causes._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is customary to classify the causes of disease in plants into two\r\nprincipal groups--(1) those due to the action of the non-living\r\nenvironment--soil, atmosphere, physical conditions such as temperature,\r\nlight, etc.; and (2) those brought about by the activities of living\r\norganisms--plants and animals of various species. Before passing to\r\nfurther subdivisions under these two heads, however, it is necessary to\r\nobserve that no disease can be efficiently caused by an organism alone,\r\nsince its powers for injury as a parasite, or otherwise, are affected by\r\nits non-living environment as well as by the host-plant. For instance,\r\nthe spores of a parasitic fungus which would infect and rapidly destroy\r\na potato plant in moist warm weather may be showered on to such a plant\r\nwith impunity if the air remains dry and cool--or on to a cabbage under\r\nany circumstances as far as we know.\r\n\r\nAgain, probably no one factor of the non-living environment ever\r\nsuffices to induce a disease, possibly because no such thing as only one\r\nchange at a time ever occurs. For instance, it is difficult to say, when\r\na soil becomes sodden with water, whether the excess of water and\r\ndissolved matters, the want of air displaced by the water, the lowering\r\nof the temperature, or the accumulation of foul products, etc., is the\r\nprincipal factor in causing the damage which results, and we have to\r\ndetermine by the balance of experimental evidence which is the dominant\r\nfactor in all such cases.\r\n\r\nThe study of aetiology of disease is in fact only a particular case of\r\nthat of aetiology in general. Plants at high altitudes in the Alps\r\nacquire very different characteristics from the same species in the\r\nplains. Is this due to the low temperature, the rarer atmosphere, the\r\nmore intense illumination, the changes in moisture, etc., etc.? The\r\nquestion is more difficult than it appears at first sight, and we must\r\nremember that, complex as are the factors working on the host, they are\r\nequally complex in their actions on a parasite attacking the host,\r\nwhence the resulting disease becomes indeed a tangled problem of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nFinally it remains to say a few words about a numerous class of cases\r\nwhere no external cause of disease can be discovered. It was formerly\r\nthe custom to group such cases of \"Internal Causes\" by themselves, but\r\napart from the fact that many of these mysterious diseases have\r\nsubsequently been shown to be due to the action of external agencies,\r\nthe whole question of internal causes resolves itself into one of\r\nrelations between the plant and its surroundings, and it becomes evident\r\nthat no inherited or internal disease can be regarded as explained until\r\nwe know the external causes which have so modified the structure and\r\nworking of the living cells as to make them abnormal in their reactions\r\nto other parts of the plant. \"Internal causes\" of disease, therefore, is\r\na phrase expressing our ignorance, but somewhat more emphatically than\r\nusual. If this is clearly understood there seems no reason against its\r\nemployment for the time being in the artificial scheme of classification\r\nwe require. With regard to external causes due to the non-living\r\nenvironment, excess or deficiency of materials in the soil, water, or\r\natmosphere plays an important part, and--since we may neglect purely\r\naquatic plants--it is customary to speak of diseases due to unsuitable\r\nsoils or to injurious atmospheric influences. For instance, any\r\ndeficiency in the supplies of the necessary mineral salts (compounds of\r\ncalcium, magnesium, potassium with sulphuric, nitric and phosphoric\r\nacids, etc.) leads to pathological changes, as also does the lack of the\r\nnecessary traces of iron. But it is equally true that the presence of\r\nsuch ingredients in excess or in combinations unsuited to the plants\r\nalso leads to disaster, as also does the presence of minerals or other\r\ncompounds which poison the root-hairs--_e.g._ products of decomposition,\r\nsoluble salts of copper and other poisons. That these matters are bound\r\nup with the whole question of manuring and of proper soil-analyses will\r\nbe evident.\r\n\r\nAnother essential factor is the nature and quantity of organic materials\r\nin the soil, whether leaf-mould and decomposing vegetable remains,\r\nstable manures, or other animal matters, all of which affect different\r\nspecies very differently, and produce very different results in\r\ndifferent soils. It is necessary to apprehend in this connection what\r\nhas been stated above: that soil is not a mere dead structureless\r\nmedium, and that the root-hairs of ordinary plants cannot deal with\r\nlarge quantities of putrefying organic matter: that a good soil must\r\nabound in useful bacteria and fungi to render such substances\r\navailable--and in very various ways--and that it must be open and\r\naerated, of proper temperature and suitably supplied with water, and so\r\nforth, or disaster will result. Here, again, then we are brought into\r\nclose contact with all that is known of fermentation, nitrification, and\r\nthe various biological changes going on in soil, and the application of\r\nsuch knowledge to the practice of manuring and tillage in all its forms.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above remarks, the danger of \"over-feeding,\" in this\r\nsense, has a real meaning for horticulturists, though it must not be\r\nforgotten that no substance is really a food until it is assimilable\r\ninto the protoplasm: manures, etc., are food-materials, not food. The\r\nfutility of mere chemical analyses to prove what a plant requires is now\r\nwell known, and it is only on the basis of long and carefully conducted\r\nexperiments that we can ever discover what a particular plant in a\r\nparticular soil, situation, and climate requires for healthy\r\ndevelopment. Again, the quantity of water in soil may be too great or\r\ntoo small for given species, and this either on the average for the\r\nyear, or during critical periods only; and it is obviously important\r\nwhether the excess or deficiency is due to improper supplies of water,\r\nthe depth or shallowness of the soil, its retentive powers, or the\r\nnature of the sub-soil and so on, again bringing the whole matter into\r\nconnection with our understanding of the physical constitution and\r\nstructure of soils, and the nature of soil-drainage.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a common way of killing ferns is to keep the roots and\r\nsoil wet and the air and fronds dry, whereas the natural habitats\r\nprovide for wet and shaded fronds and well-drained soil.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here that in most cases where gardeners speak of plants\r\nbeing killed under the \"drip\" of trees--_e.g._ Beech, the injury is due,\r\nnot to the effects of water but to the shade: the loss of light is so\r\ngreat that the shaded plants die of inanition because their leaves are\r\nnot able to provide sufficient carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nClosely bound up with this is the question of the gases in soils. Apart\r\nfrom the disastrous effects of poisons--_e.g._ coal gas escaping from\r\npipes under pavements in towns, etc., diseased conditions often result\r\nfrom deficiency of oxygen at the root-hairs, due to imperfect aeration\r\nof soils, brought about by stagnant water, excess of animal matter, and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\nUnsuitable constitution of the atmosphere is also a fruitful source of\r\ndisease, though its effects are commoner in closed stoves and\r\ngreenhouses than in the open. Nevertheless the continual exhalation of\r\nsulphurous fumes, chlorine, and other poisonous gases in the\r\nneighbourhood of manufacturing centres or of large smoky towns,\r\nvolcanoes, etc., play their part in injuring plants; and excessive\r\nmoisture in the form of mist, rain, etc., is also important. All these\r\nmatters bring us at once into the region of physiology, and only an\r\nintelligent appreciation of what is known about the action of the\r\natmosphere on the soil and the plant will save the peasantry of a\r\ncountry from a hopeless mysticism but little removed from that of the\r\nMiddle Ages, when blights and other evils were vaguely referred to the\r\nriver-mists, thunder clouds, and easterly winds.\r\n\r\nIf we summarise the above as the material factors of the environment, we\r\nmay classify another set of external non-living causes of disease as the\r\nnon-material factors. Such are principally the following:\r\n\r\nThe space at the disposal of plants greatly affects their welfare. The\r\ncrowding of roots in the soil and of foliage in the air, resulting in\r\nthe loss of light to the leaves, involves deficiency of all the\r\nmaterials referred to above--minerals, organic materials, gases, and\r\nwater--and no better illustration of the intense struggle for existence\r\namong these apparently passive and motionless beings, plants, can be\r\ngiven than an over-crowded seedbed or plantation. If left to themselves\r\nsuch over-stocked areas exhibit to the keen eye of the trained observer\r\nall the phases of starvation, weakness, wounding, rot, and, so to speak,\r\nbrutal dominance of the stronger over the weaker which it is the object\r\nof cultivation to prevent. Here, then, we are brought face to face with\r\nthe true significance of thinning and weeding out, pruning, and similar\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nUnsuitable temperature is one of the commonest of all sources of\r\ndisease, for every plant is adapted to certain ranges of temperature,\r\nand best adapted to a given optimum somewhere between the maximum and\r\nminimum temperature for each function. Consequently any serious\r\ndeparture from the mean may bring about physiological disturbances of\r\nthe nature of disease, and this in very various ways, as exemplified by\r\nthe results of frost, sun-scorching, drought, hail-storms, forest fires,\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\nAs a predisposing factor to disease abnormal temperature effects play a\r\ngreat part. Many wound-fungi gain their entrance through frost-cracks,\r\nbruises due to hailstones, or into tissues chilled below the normal.\r\n\r\nNo less remarkable are the diseases primarily due to insufficient or\r\nimproper exposure to light, which affects the chlorophyll-apparatus and\r\nthe process of carbon-assimilation and through these the whole\r\nwell-being of the plant. Every plant is adapted to certain ranges of\r\nlight intensity, and most cultivators know how impossible it is to grow\r\nshade plants in fully exposed situations, and how easily plants which\r\nlive in open sunny situations are \"drawn\" and killed by shade. It is\r\nequally important to have the right kind of light, as disastrous\r\nexperiences with greenhouses glazed with glass which cut off certain\r\nrays of light have taught. Here, again, it is important to notice that\r\nthe optimum intensity or quality of light may differ for different\r\nfunctions and organs of the plant, as is shown by many adaptations on\r\nthe part of species growing in natural situations--_e.g._ bud\r\nprotection, orientation of leaves, etc.--and it may be taken as a rule\r\nthat etiolated plants are peculiarly susceptible to other diseases.\r\n\r\nAs regards other factors of the inorganic environment, disasters which\r\ncome within the scope of our subject may be brought about by many\r\nagencies, the mechanical effects of snow and hail, wind, avalanches,\r\netc., the effects of lightning, and so forth, being a few of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n     For other detailed classifications of the causes of disease\r\n     the reader is referred to the works of Sorauer and of Frank\r\n     referred to in the last chapter. Also Kirchner, _Pflanzen\r\n     Krankheiten_, Stuttgart, 1890.\r\n\r\n     Of more historical importance are the older classifications of\r\n     Berkeley, _Gardeners' Chronicle_, 1854, and Re, _Gardeners'\r\n     Chronicle_, 1849-50. These latter are interesting as showing\r\n     the very different views held by the earlier workers, and\r\n     comparison of these with the modern views helps to mark the\r\n     progress of physiology during the half century which has\r\n     intervened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF DISEASE. THE LIVING ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n     _Causes due to animals--Vertebrata--Wounds, etc.--Invertebrata\r\n     --Insects, etc.--Plants as causes of disease--Phanerogams,\r\n     weeds, etc.--Cryptogams, fungi--Epidemics, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing now to those causes of disease which are connected with the\r\nliving environment, we may obviously divide them into two groups of\r\nagents, animals and plants.\r\n\r\nAmong animals, the various vertebrata, including man, are especially\r\nresponsible for the larger kinds of wounds and wholesale destructive\r\nprocesses due to breakage, stripping of leaves and bark, cutting and\r\nbiting, and so forth. Cattle, rabbits, rats and mice, squirrels and\r\nbirds of various kinds stand out prominently as enemies to trees and\r\nother plants, to which they do immense injury in various ways by their\r\nhorns, teeth, claws, and beaks; and the damage which an ignorant\r\ngardener or forester can do with his ill-guided footsteps, axe, spade,\r\nand knife can only be appreciated by one who knows the habits of plants.\r\n\r\nIt is among the invertebrata, however, especially insects and worms,\r\nthat the most striking agents of disease in plants are to be found, for,\r\nwith the exception of certain rodents--and we may logically include also\r\nhuman invasions--vertebrate animals do not often appear in such numbers\r\nas to bring about the epidemics and scourges only too commonly caused by\r\ninsect pests.\r\n\r\nInsects injure plants in very various ways. Some, such as locusts,\r\nsimply devour all before them; others, _e.g._ caterpillars, destroy the\r\nleaves and bring about all the phenomena of defoliation. Others, again,\r\neat the buds--_e.g._ _Grapholitha_; or the roots--_e.g._ wire-worms, and\r\nso maim the plant that its foliage and assimilation suffer, or its roots\r\nbecome too scanty to supply the transpiration current. Many aphides,\r\netc., puncture the leaves, suck out the sap, and produce deformations\r\nand arrest of leaf-surface, as well as actual loss of substance, and\r\nwhen numerous such insects induce all the evils of defoliation. Others,\r\nsuch as the leaf-miners, tunnel into the leaves, with similar results on\r\na smaller scale.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that a single complete defoliation of a herbaceous\r\nannual, or even of a tuberous plant like the potato, so incapacitates\r\nthe assimilatory machinery of the plant, that no stores can be put aside\r\nfor the seeds, tubers, etc., of another year, or at most so little that\r\nonly feeble plants come up.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a tree the case is different, and since most large trees\r\nin full foliage have far more assimilatory surface than is actually\r\nnecessary for immediate needs, a considerable tax can be paid to\r\nparasites or predatory insects before the stores suffer perceptibly.\r\nStill, it should be recognised that the injury tells in time, especially\r\nin seed years.\r\n\r\nMany larvae of beetles, moths, etc., bore into the bark and as far as\r\nthe cambium or even into the wood or pith of trees, the local damage\r\ninducing general injuries in proportion to the number of insects at\r\nwork: moreover, the wounds afford points of entrance for fungi and other\r\npests.\r\n\r\nGalls and similar excrescences result from the hypertrophy of young\r\nliving tissues pierced by the ovipositors of various insects, and\r\nirritated by the injected fluid and the presence of the eggs and larvae\r\nleft behind. They may occur on the buds, leaves, stems, or roots, as\r\nshown by various species of _Cynips_ on oak, _Phylloxera_ on vines,\r\netc., in all cases the local damage being relatively small, but the\r\ngeneral injury to assimilatory, absorptive, and other functions is great\r\nin proportion to the number of points attacked.\r\n\r\nMany grubs--larvae of flies, beetles, etc.--bore into the sheaths or\r\ninternodes of grasses, or the pith of twigs, or into buds, fruits, and\r\nother organs of plants, and do harm corresponding to the kind and amount\r\nof tissues injured.\r\n\r\nVarious species of so-called eelworms--Nematodes--also cause gall-like\r\nswellings on young roots, or they invade the grains of cereals.\r\n\r\nFinally, various slugs and snails cause much injury by devouring young\r\nleaves and buds and diminishing the assimilatory area.\r\n\r\nPlants as agents of disease or injury fall naturally into the two main\r\ncategories of flowering plants (Phanerogams) and Cryptogams, among which\r\nthe fungi are the especially important pests.\r\n\r\nBeginning with weeds, we find a large class of injurious agents. Weeds\r\ndamage the plants we value by crowding them out in the struggle for\r\nexistence, as already stated, and when the weed-action is simply due to\r\nsuperfluous plants of the same species, we speak of overcrowding. But it\r\nmust not be overlooked that the competition between crowded plants of\r\nthe same species--where every individual is acting as a weed to the\r\nothers--may be more dangerous than between plants and weeds belonging to\r\nother species and genera, because in the former case they are struggling\r\nfor the same minerals and other necessary food-materials: a matter of\r\nimportance in connection with the rotation of crops.\r\n\r\nThe question of allowing grass to grow at the foot of fruit trees, as in\r\norchards, is a good case in point. Such grass may increase the damp and\r\nshade, thus favouring fungi at one season, and dry up the moisture of\r\nthe soil to the injury of the fine superficial roots at another, as well\r\nas exhaust the soil, owing to the competition of the roots for salts\r\nand other materials. On the other hand, the checking of surface roots by\r\ncompetition with the grass has been claimed as advantageous. In this\r\nconnection probably the whole question of the composition of the turf\r\narises, as well as that of possible cropping for hay, and manuring.\r\n\r\nAs regards any particular weed, the cultivator should learn all he can\r\nrespecting its duration, seeding capacity, method of dissemination, the\r\ndepth and spread of its root-system, and any other particulars which\r\nenable him to judge when and how to attack it. It is only necessary to\r\nsee the victory of such drought-resisting weeds as _Hieracium\r\npilosella_, Plantains, _Hypochaeris_, on lawns to realise how weeds may\r\nwin in the struggle for existence with the finer grasses.\r\n\r\nMany so-called weeds are, however, partially parasitic, with their roots\r\non the roots of others--_e.g._ _Rhinanthus_, _Thesium_, etc., and much\r\ndamage is done to meadow grasses and herbage by the exhaustive tax which\r\nthese semi-parasites impose.\r\n\r\nThis is carried still further in the case of such root-parasites as\r\n_Orobanche_, where the host-plant is burdened with the whole support of\r\nthe pest, because the latter, having no chlorophyll, is entirely\r\ndependent on the former for all its food.\r\n\r\nEven ordinary climbing plants may injure others by shading them, either\r\nby scrambling over their branches--_e.g._ Bramble, or twisting their\r\ntendrils round the twigs--_e.g._ Bryony, or twining round them--_e.g._\r\nWoodbine, _Convolvulus_, etc. The principal direct injury is in these\r\ncases owing to the loss of light suffered by the shaded foliage, but\r\nthe weed-action is often increased by the competition of their\r\nroots--_e.g._ briars; and in the case of woody climbers the gradually\r\nincreased pressure of the woody-coils round the thickening stems\r\ncompresses the cambium and cortex of the support and induces strictures\r\nand abnormalities which may be fatal in course of time.\r\n\r\nEpiphytes, or plants which support themselves wholly on the trunks,\r\nbranches, or leaves of other plants, also injure the latter more\r\nespecially by shading their foliage--_e.g._ tropical Figs, Orchids,\r\nAroids, etc.; and similar damage is done by our own Ivy, the main roots\r\nof which are in the soil, but the numerous adventitious roots of which\r\ncling to the bark.\r\n\r\nWhen the climber or epiphyte is also parasitic, as in the case of the\r\nDodder, _Loranthus_, Mistletoe, etc., the direct loss of substance\r\nstolen from the host by the parasite comes in to supplement any effect\r\nof shading that the latter may bring about if it is a leafy plant.\r\n\r\nOf Cryptogams, apart from a few epiphytic ferns, and the intense\r\nweed-action of certain Equisetums, the rhizomes and roots of which are\r\nas troublesome as those of twitch and other phanerogamic weeds, it is\r\nespecially the fungi which act as agents of disease, and which, as we\r\nnow know, are _par excellence_ the causes of epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe action of fungi may be local or general; and restricted, slow and\r\ninsidious, or virulent and rapidly destructive.\r\n\r\nExamples of local action are furnished by _Schinzia_, which forms\r\ngall-like swellings on the roots of rushes; _Gymnosporangium_, which\r\ninduces excrescences on the stems of junipers, and numerous leaf-fungi\r\n(_Puccinia_, _AEcidium_, _Septoria_, etc.), which cause yellow, brown, or\r\nblack spots on leaves, as well as by _Ustilago_, which attacks the\r\nanthers or the ovary of various plants, and so forth. In such cases the\r\ninjury done by a few centres of infection is very slight, but prolonged\r\naction may bring into play secondary effects such as the gradual\r\ndestruction of the cambium round a branch, when, of course, the effect\r\nof ringing results; or if the fungus becomes epidemic and myriads of\r\nleaf-spots are formed, the destruction of foliar tissue, gradual taxing\r\nof the assimilatory cells, etc., may end in rapid defoliation, and\r\nrenewed attacks soon exhaust the plants and lead to sterility and death,\r\nas often occurs with Uredineae--_e.g._ the coffee leaf-disease.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that such fungi are particularly exacting owing to\r\ntheir exhausting demands for compounds of potassium, phosphoric acid,\r\nand other bodies.\r\n\r\nExamples of virulent and rampant general action are afforded by finger\r\nand toe in turnips, etc., where the roots are invaded by\r\n_Plasmodiophora_, which induces hypertrophy and rotting of the roots;\r\nand by the damping off of seedlings, where the fungus _Pythium_ rapidly\r\ninvades all parts of the seedlings and reduces them to a water-logged,\r\nputrefying mass; or the potato-disease, which is due to the rapid\r\nspread of _Phytophthora_ in the leaves and throughout the plant, which\r\nit blackens and rots in a few days.\r\n\r\nMany fungi not in themselves very virulent or aggressive do enormous\r\nharm owing to the secondary effects they induce. Some of the\r\ntree-killing hymenomycetes, such as _Agaricus melleus_, for instance,\r\npenetrate the wood of a pine at the collar, and the result of the large\r\nflow of resin which results is to so block up the water passages that\r\nthe tree dies off above with all the symptoms of drought. Similarly, the\r\n_Peziza_ causing the larch disease, having obtained access to the stem\r\nabout a foot or so above the ground, will gradually kill the cambium\r\nfurther and further round the stem, and so girdle the tree as\r\neffectually as if we had cut out the new wood all round. In all such\r\ncases--and the same applies to the leaf-diseases referred to above--the\r\nfungus may be compared to an army which is not strong enough to invade\r\nthe whole territory, but which, by striking at the lines of\r\ncommunication, cuts off the supplies of water, food, etc., and so brings\r\nthe struggle to an end. Indeed we might compare the cases of fungi which\r\nattack the root and collar, and so strike at and cut off the water\r\nsupply, to a compact army which at once cuts off the enemy from his\r\nnarrow base; whereas the innumerable units which bring about an epidemic\r\nattack on the leaves, and so surround the enemy and cut off his food\r\nsupplies all round, is rather like a much larger army which cannot get\r\nin beyond the natural barriers of the tissues, and so puts a _cordon_\r\nall round the territory and seizes the multitudes of food-stuffs at the\r\nfrontiers. The end result is similar in both cases, but the methods of\r\nwarfare differ.\r\n\r\nMany fungi, however, though they make their presence noticeable by\r\nconspicuous signs, cannot be said to do much damage to the individual\r\nplant attacked. The extraordinary malformations induced by parasites\r\nlike _Exoascus_, which live in the ends of twigs of trees and stimulate\r\nthe buds to put out dense tufts of shoots, again densely\r\nbranched--Witches' brooms--are a case in point. Also the curious\r\ndistortions of nettle stems swollen and curved by _AEcidium_, of maize\r\nstems and leaves attacked by _Ustilago_, and of the inflorescences of\r\n_Capsella_ by _Cystopus_, etc., are not individually very destructive;\r\nit is the cumulative effects of numerous attacks, or of large epidemics,\r\nwhich tell in the end.\r\n\r\nSome very curious effects are due to fungi such as _AEcidium elatinum_,\r\nwhich, living in the cortex of firs, stimulate buds to put out shoots\r\nwith erect habit, and with leaves which are radially disposed, annually\r\ncast, and differently shaped from the normal--characters quite foreign\r\nto the species of fir in its natural condition.\r\n\r\nEqually strange are the shoots of _Euphorbia_ infested with the aecidia\r\nof _Uromyces_, those of bilberries affected with _Calyptospora_, etc. In\r\nall these cases we must assume a condition of toleration, so to speak,\r\non the part of the host, which adapts itself to the altered\r\ncircumstances by marked adaptations in its tissue developments, mode of\r\ngrowth and so forth.\r\n\r\nThis toleration is perhaps most marked in the case of those cereals\r\nwhich, though infected by the minute mycelium of _Ustilago_ while still\r\na seedling, nevertheless go on growing as apparently healthy green\r\nplants indistinguishable from the rest, although the fine hyphae of the\r\nparasite are in the tissues and keeping pace with the growth of the\r\nshoots just behind the growing points. As the grains of the cereal begin\r\nto form and swell, however, the hyphae suddenly assume the part of a\r\ndominant aggressor, consume the endosperm of the enlarging seed, and\r\nreplace the contents of the grain with the well-known black spores known\r\nas Smut.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n     The reader will find a summary of such fungi as are here\r\n     concerned in Massee, _A Text-Book of Plant Diseases_, 1899, or\r\n     Prillieux, _Maladies des Plantes Agricoles_.\r\n\r\n     For further details the student should consult the works of\r\n     Frank and Sorauer referred to in the notes to Chapter IX., and\r\n     Tubeuf, _The Diseases of Plants_, Engl. ed. 1897, pp. 104-539.\r\n\r\n     For experiments on the effects of grass on orchard trees, see\r\n     _Report of the Woburn Experimental Fruit Farm_, 1900, p. 160.\r\n\r\n     For the further study of weeds, the interesting bulletins of\r\n     the Kansas State Agricultural College, 1895-1898, will show\r\n     the reader what may be done in the matter of classifying them\r\n     according to their biological peculiarities.\r\n\r\n     In regard to insects, the reader will find the following list\r\n     embraces the subject: Somerville, _Farm and Garden Insects_,\r\n     1897; Theobald, _Insect Life_, 1896; Ormerod, _Manual of\r\n     Injurious Insects_, 1890, and _Handbook of Insects Injurious\r\n     to Orchards, etc._, 1898.\r\n\r\n     The admirable series of publications of the U.S. Department of\r\n     Agriculture under the editorship of Riley and Howard, and\r\n     entitled _Insect Life_, 1888-1895, also abounds in\r\n     information.\r\n\r\n     Further, Taschenberg's _Praktische Insektenkunde_, 1879-1880,\r\n     and Judeich and Nietsche, _Lehrbuch der Mitteleurop.

A plant may be diseased as a\r\nwhole because all or practically all its tissues are in a morbid or\r\npathological condition, such as occurs when some fungus invades all the\r\nparts or organs--_e.g._ seedlings when completely infested by _Pythium_,\r\nor a unicellular Alga when invaded by a minute parasite; or it may die\r\nthroughout, because some organ with functions essential to its life is\r\nseriously affected--_e.g._ the roots are rotten and cannot absorb water\r\nwith dissolved minerals and pass it up to the shoot, or all the leaves\r\nare infested with a parasite and cannot supply the rest of the plant\r\nwith organic food materials, in consequence of which parts not directly\r\naffected by any malady become starved, dried-up, or poisoned or\r\notherwise injured by the results or products of disease elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of cases, however, the disease is purely local, and\r\nnever extends into the rest of the organs or tissues--_e.g._ when an\r\ninsect pierces a leaf at some minute point with its proboscis or its\r\novipositor, killing a few cells and irritating those around so that they\r\ngrow and divide more rapidly than the rest of the leaf tissues and\r\nproduce a swollen hump of tissue, or gall; or when a knife-cut wounds\r\nthe cambium, which forthwith begins to cover up the dead cells with a\r\nsimilarly rapid growth of cells, the callus. Numerous minute spots due\r\nto fungi on leaves, cortex, etc., are further cases in point, the\r\nmycelium never extending far from the centre of infection.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to classify diseases on a basis which\r\nassumes the essential distinction of the above cases, and we read of\r\ndiseases of the various organs--root-diseases, stem-diseases,\r\nleaf-diseases, and so forth; or of the various tissues--timber-diseases,\r\ndiseases of the cambium, of the bark, of the parenchyma, and so on.\r\nFurthermore, attempts have been made to speak of general functional\r\ndisease, of diseases of the respiratory organs, of the absorptive\r\norgans, and so forth, as opposed to local lesions.\r\n\r\nCritical examination, however, shows that no such distinctions can be\r\nconsistently maintained, partly because the organs and functions of\r\nplants are not so sharply marked off as they are in animals, the\r\ndiseases of which have suggested the above classification, and partly\r\nbecause all disease originates in the cells and tissues, and it is a\r\nmatter of detail only that in some cases--_e.g._ severe freezing or\r\ndrought of seedlings, or when some ingredient is wanting in the\r\nsoil--the diseased condition affects practically every cell alike from\r\nthe first, while in others it spreads more or less rapidly from some one\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nEven the distinction into physiological diseases _versus_ parasitic\r\ndiseases cannot be maintained from the standpoint of the nature of the\r\ndisease itself. All disease is physiological in so far as it consists in\r\ndisturbance of normal physiological function, for pathology is merely\r\nabnormal physiology, no matter how it is brought about. This is not\r\nsaying that no importance is to be attached to the mode in which disease\r\nis incurred or induced: it is merely insisting on the truth that the\r\ndisease itself consists in the living cell-substance--the\r\nprotoplasm--not working normally as it does in health, and this, whether\r\nwant of water, minerals, or organic food be the cause, or whether the\r\npresence of some poison or mechanical irritant be the disturbing agent,\r\nas also whether such want or irritation be due to some defect in soil\r\nor air, or to the ravages of a fungus or an insect.\r\n\r\nThis being understood I need not dwell on the common fallacy of\r\nconfounding the fungus, insect, soil or other agent with the disease\r\nitself, or of making the same blunder in confusing symptoms with\r\nmaladies. In this sense, wheat rust is not a disease: it is a symptom\r\nwhich betrays the presence of a disease-inducing fungus, the Rust\r\nfungus. Similarly, chlorosis is not a disease: it is a symptom of\r\nimperfect chlorophyll action, and the best proof of the truth of both\r\nstatements is that in both cases the fundamental disease-action is the\r\nstarvation of the cell-protoplasm of carbohydrates and other essential\r\nfood matters--in the one case because the fungus steals the\r\ncarbohydrates as fast as the leaves can make them, in the second because\r\nthe leaf is unable to make them.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of a knowledge of disease in plants therefore centres in\r\nthe understanding of the pathology of living cells.\r\n\r\nIf a suitable mass of living cells is neatly cut with a sharp razor the\r\nfirst perceptible change is one of colour: the white \"flesh\" of a potato\r\nor an apple, for instance, turns brown as the air enters the cut cells,\r\nand the microscope shows that this browning affects cell-walls and\r\ncontents alike. The cut cells also die forthwith; and the oxygen of the\r\nair combining with some of their constituents forms the brown colouring\r\nmatter which soaks into the cell-walls. The uninjured cells below them\r\ngrow longer, pushing up the dead debris, and divide across by walls\r\nparallel to the plane of the wound, and so form series of tabular cells\r\nwith thin walls, which also soon turn brown and die, the cell-walls\r\nmeanwhile undergoing changes which convert them into cork. The living\r\ncells deeper down are now shut off from the outer world by a skin, of\r\nseveral layers, of cork-cells, which prevent the further free access of\r\nair or moisture. During the period of active cell-division which\r\ninitiates the cork, the temperature of the growing cells rises: a sort\r\nof fever (wound-fever) is induced, evidently owing to the active\r\nrespiration of the growing cells.\r\n\r\nThis healing by cork occurs in any tissue of living cells exposed by a\r\ncut--leaf-tissue, young stem or root, fruit, cambium, etc.; and the same\r\napplies to any other kind of cutting or tearing injury--such as a prick\r\nwith a needle or the proboscis of an insect, a stripping, or even a\r\nbruise.\r\n\r\nSuch healing is prepared for and carried out very thoroughly in the case\r\nof falling leaves and cast branches, the plane of separation being\r\ncovered by a cicatrix of cork.\r\n\r\nIf the cell-tissue under the wound is actually growing at the time,\r\nhowever, a further process is observed when the wound-cork has been\r\nformed. The uninjured cells below go on growing outwards more vigorously\r\nthan ever, the pressure of the overlying tissues taken off by the cut\r\nhaving been removed, and, lifting up the cork-layer as they do so, they\r\nrapidly divide into a juicy mass of thin-walled cells which is of a\r\ncushion-like nature and is termed a _Callus_. This callus is at first a\r\nhomogeneous tissue of cells which are all alike capable of growing and\r\ndividing, but in course of time it undergoes changes in different parts\r\nwhich result in the formation of tracheids, vessels, fibres and other\r\ntissue-elements, and even organs, just as the embryonic tissues of the\r\ngrowing points, cambium, etc., of the healthy plant give origin to new\r\ngrowths. Such wound-wood, however, is apt to differ considerably in the\r\narrangement, constitution and hardness of its parts as compared with\r\nnormal wood, and its peculiar density and cross-graining are often\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nIf instead of a simple tissue, the cut or other wound lays bare a\r\ncomplex mass such as wood, the resultant changes are essentially the\r\nsame to start with. The living cells bordering the wound form cork, and\r\nthen those deeper down grow out and form a callus. The exposure of the\r\nwood however, entails alterations in its non-living elements also. The\r\nlignified walls of tracheids, fibres, etc., turn brown to a considerable\r\ndepth, and this browning seems to be--like all such discolorations in\r\nwounds--due to oxidation changes in the tannins and other bodies\r\npresent: the process is probably similar to what occurs in humification\r\nand in the conversion of sap-wood into heart-wood in trees. Such wood is\r\nnot merely dead, but it is also incapable of conveying water in the\r\nlumina of its elements, which slowly fill with similarly dark-coloured,\r\nimpervious masses of materials termed \"wound-gum,\" the nature of which\r\nis obscure, but which slowly undergoes further changes into resin-like\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe exposure of wood by a wound results also in another mode of stopping\r\nup the vessels and so hindering the access of air, loss of water, etc.,\r\nfor the living cells of the medullary rays and wood-parenchyma grow into\r\nthe lumina of the larger vessels through the pits, forming _thyloses_,\r\nagain a phenomenon met with in heart-wood. In Conifers the stoppage of\r\nthe lumina is increased by deposition of resin, which also soaks into\r\nthe cell-walls and the wounded wood becomes semi-translucent owing to\r\nthe infiltration.\r\n\r\nEvery living cell in an active condition is irritable, and one of the\r\ncommonest physiological reactions of growing tissues is that of\r\nresponding to the touch of a resistant body, as is vividly shown by the\r\nmovements of the Sensitive plant, _Dionaea_, etc., and by those of\r\ntendrils, growing root tips, etc., on careful observation. We have\r\nreason for stating that if a minute insect, too feeble to pierce the\r\ncuticle, cling on to one side of the dome-shaped growing point of any\r\nshoot, the irritation of contact of its claws, hairs, etc., would at\r\nonce cause the protoplasm of the delicate cells to respond by some\r\nabnormal behaviour; and, as matter of experiment, Darwin showed long ago\r\nthat if a minute piece of glass or other hard body is kept in contact\r\nwith one side of the tip of a root, the growth on the side in contact is\r\ninterfered with. Moreover we know from experiments on heliotropism,\r\nthermotropism, etc., that even intangible stimuli such as rays of light,\r\netc., impinging unsymmetrically on these delicate cells cause\r\nalterations in their behaviour--_e.g._ arrest or acceleration of growth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable class of stimulations, however, is that due\r\nto the presence of the entire protoplasmic body of one organism in the\r\ncell of another, each living its own life for the time being, but the\r\nprotoplasm of the host cell showing clearly, by its abnormal behaviour,\r\nthat the presence of the foreign protoplasm is affecting its physiology.\r\nA simple example is afforded by Zopfs' _Pleotrachelus_, the amoeboid\r\nprotoplasmic body of which lives in the hypha of _Pilobolus_, causing it\r\nto swell up like an inflated bladder, in which the parasite then forms\r\nits sporangia. The _Pleotrachelus_ does not kill the _Pilobolus_, but\r\nthat its protoplasm alters the metabolic physiology of the latter is\r\nshown by the hypertrophy of the cells, and by the curious fact that it\r\nstimulates the _Pilobolus_ to form its sexual conjugating cells,\r\notherwise rare, an indication of very far-reaching interference with the\r\nlife-actions of the host.\r\n\r\nAn equally remarkable example is that of _Plasmodiophora_, the amoeboid\r\nnaked protoplasm of which lives and creeps about in the protoplasm of a\r\ncell of the root of a turnip, to which it gains access through the\r\nroot-hairs. It does not kill the cell, but stimulates its protoplasm to\r\nincreased activity and growth and division, itself dividing also and\r\npassing new amoebae into each new daughter-cell of the host. Here the\r\nprocesses of stimulation, hypertrophy and further division are repeated,\r\nuntil hundreds or thousands of the turnip root-cells are infected. The\r\nexternally visible result is the formation of distorted swellings on the\r\nroot (Finger and Toe), most of the cells of which are abnormally large\r\nand filled with amoeboid _Plasmodiophora_ protoplasm, which finally\r\ndevours the turnip-protoplasm and itself passes over into spores. Here\r\nwe have most convincing proof of the stimulation of protoplasm by other\r\nprotoplasm in direct contact with it; and that the metabolism of the\r\nhost-cells is profoundly altered is shown not only by the abnormal\r\ngrowth of the cells, but also by the starvation of the rest of the\r\nturnip plant as the _Plasmodiophora_ gets the upper hand. We have here,\r\nin fact, a local intracellular parasitic disease, gradually invading\r\nlarge tracts of tissue and eventually inducing general disease resulting\r\nin death--a state of affairs reminding us of cancer in animals.\r\n\r\nIrritation and hypertrophy of cells, however, may be induced by\r\nparasites which never bring their protoplasm into direct contact with\r\nthat of the host. Many Chytridiaceae penetrate the cells of plants, and\r\ngrow inside them as short tubes, vesicles, etc., the protoplasm of which\r\nis separated by their own cell-walls from that of the host-cell;\r\nnevertheless hypertrophy and abnormal cell-divisions and secretions are\r\ninduced, and the effect even extends to neighbouring cells--_e.g._\r\n_Synchytrium_--showing that some influence is exerted through cells\r\nthemselves not directly affected. This latter point need not surprise us\r\nnow we know that the cells of plant-tissues are connected by fine\r\nprotoplasmic strands passing through the separating cell-walls.\r\n\r\nBut the invading plant need not actually enter the cells, and may still\r\nstimulate them through both its own and their own cell-walls to abnormal\r\ngrowth. This is well shown by the intercellular mycelium of _Exoacus_\r\nand _Exobasidium_, and the latter affords an excellent illustration of\r\nthe far-reaching effects of hyphae on the cells (of _Vaccinium_) into\r\nwhich they do not penetrate. Not only are the cells stimulated to grow\r\nlarger and divide oftener than normally, thus producing large gall-like\r\nswellings, but the chlorophyll disappears, the cell sap changes colour\r\nto red, the numerous compound crystals normally found in the tissues\r\ndiminish in number and are different in shape, large quantities of\r\nstarch are stored up, and even the vascular bundles are altered in\r\ncharacter. All these changes indicate very profound alterations in the\r\nphysiological working of the protoplasm of the cells of the host, and\r\nyet the fungus has done its work through both its own cell-walls and\r\nthose of the host.\r\n\r\nEven harmless endophytic algae in the intercellular spaces of plants may\r\nstimulate the cells in their immediate neighbourhood to increased\r\ngrowth, _e.g._ _Anabaena_ in the roots of Cycads.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     With reference to cork-healing and wound-fever the student may\r\n     consult Shattock \"On the Reparative processes which occur in\r\n     Vegetable Tissues,\" _Journal of the Linnean Society_, 1882,\r\n     Vol. XIX., p. 1; and Shattock \"On the Fall of Branchlets in\r\n     the Aspen,\" _Journal of Botany_, 1883, Vol. XXI., p. 306.

Unfertilised eggs of insects have been started into\r\ngrowth by treatment with acids and those of frogs with mercury salts,\r\nand the germination of beans quickened by various poisonous alkaloids.\r\nIn other words, graduated doses of poison may alter the physiological\r\nactivity of living cells, inducing pathological phenomena, while larger\r\ndoses kill them.\r\n\r\nNow we know at least one parasitic fungus which poisons the cells of its\r\nhost, and kills them, with similar symptoms to those resulting from\r\nexcessive doses of the above-named toxic agents. _Botrytis_ hyphae,\r\nliving in the cell-walls of plants, but not entering the cells, excretes\r\na poison which kills the protoplasm, and the fungus then feeds on the\r\ndebris. Numerous other fungi form powerful poisons, but we do not know\r\nwhether or how they employ them--_e.g._ Ergot.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that if all the young cells of a root-tip or of the apex\r\nof a shoot, or those of a young leaf, are growing and dividing\r\nregularly, the killing of one or a few cells at one point on the side of\r\nthe organ must result in irregularities--in malformation--of the adult\r\norgan. This has been proved experimentally by destroying a few cells\r\nwith a needle. It can also be done by planting a minute mycelium of\r\n_Botrytis_ laterally on a young organ--_e.g._ a very young lily-bud. The\r\nfungus adheres to the surface, kills a few epidermis cells, and forms a\r\nfoxy-red spot, which becomes concave as the dead cells lose water and\r\ndry. Since the rest of the bud goes on growing, however, while this dead\r\npoint remains stationary, the latter gradually becomes the centre of a\r\nconcavity, the growing tissues having grown round it: the bud is\r\ndeformed. Numerous cases of malformed organs are explained in this way;\r\na minute insect has bitten or pierced the young tissue, or a fungus has\r\nkilled a minute area, or a drop of acid condensed from fumes in the air\r\nis the lethal agent, and so forth. And even on a much larger scale we\r\nsee the same kinds of agents at work. Wherever a patch of cells is\r\nkilled whilst those around go on growing, there must result some\r\ndeformation of the resulting organ, since had the injury been withheld\r\nthe number and sizes of the cells now fixed in death would have\r\nincreased and covered a larger area: they now serve to pull over to\r\ntheir side the still living and growing cells. The same results follow\r\non any lateral wound: the killed spot of tissue serves as a point round\r\nwhich the continued growth of other parts of the organ turns. Hence the\r\nmalformation is in these cases a secondary effect, and not, as in simple\r\nhypertrophy, a direct effect of the action of the cells involved in the\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of bodies secreted by fungi, however, which act\r\ndirectly on cells, viz. enzymes--that is, soluble bodies which are able\r\nto dissolve cellulose (_cytases_), starch (_diastases_), proteids\r\n(proteolytic enzymes), and other substances, by peculiar alterations in\r\ntheir constitution. It is by means of its _cytase_ that _Botrytis_\r\nhyphae pierce the cellulose walls of plants, and no doubt in all cases\r\nwhere fungi pierce cell-walls it is by the solvent action of such a\r\ncytase, and similarly when haustoria penetrate into the cells. It is\r\nalso by means of these starch-dissolving enzymes (diastases) and\r\nproteolytic enzymes, etc., that the hyphae inside the cells are enabled\r\nto make use of the starch, proteids, etc., they find there.\r\n\r\nAll living cells form materials, resulting from the activity of the\r\nprotoplasm, which we may compare with the refuse or by-products formed\r\nin any great manufacturing industry: these by-products have to be got\r\nrid of if they are injurious or noisome (_excretions_), and if\r\nnot--_i.e._ if they are capable of further use (_secretions_)--they have\r\nto be stored away till required. Some of the most prominent of these\r\nbodies excreted by fungi are, as we have seen, poisonous acids, such as\r\noxalic acid, enzymes, and organic poisons, such as those in ergot. But\r\nsimilar enzymes, acids, poisons, etc., to those found in fungi are also\r\nfound in the cells of other plants and animals; for only by means of\r\ntheir solvent actions can processes like digestion and assimilation of\r\nthe starchy and other materials into the body-substance be accomplished,\r\nand we have seen that it is a general property of living cells to form\r\nacids, and other excretions and secretions.\r\n\r\nNow we know very little about what may happen when an organism--say a\r\nfungus--secreting especially one kind of enzyme or poison or other\r\nactive substance, comes into intimate contact with another--say a\r\nleaf-cell--which secretes predominantly others, but what we do know\r\npoints to the certainty that various complications will occur.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if certain bacteria which prefer an alkaline medium, and\r\nyeasts which prefer an acid environment are mixed in a saccharine\r\nsolution, it depends on the reaction of the liquid which organism gains\r\nthe upper hand: if the liquid is acid the yeast may dominate the\r\nbacteria; if alkaline it may be suppressed by them.\r\n\r\nThat a parasite may be prevented from successfully attacking a\r\nparticular plant is shown by the failure of _Cuscuta_ to establish its\r\nhaustoria in poisonous plants such as _Euphorbia_, _Aloe_, etc., and it\r\nhas been pointed out that poisonous secretions in the cells of the plant\r\nprotect them against the penetration of fungi. This cannot be taken as\r\nmeaning that any poison protects against any parasite, however, for\r\n_Euphorbia_ is itself subject to attacks of Uredineae, and _Pangium\r\nedule_, which contains prussic acid and is extremely poisonous to most\r\nanimals, is eaten with avidity by several insects, while nematode worms\r\ncan live in its tissues. This is no more remarkable, however, than the\r\nfact that _Fontaria_, a myriapod, secretes prussic acid in its own\r\ntissues, or than that certain glands of the stomach secrete free\r\nhydrochloric acid, and _Dolium_ forms sulphuric acid in its glands.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a further point to notice here. It has been proved that\r\ncertain substances formed in plant-cells, not necessarily nutritive,\r\nattract the hyphae of parasitic fungi or repel them, according to the\r\nkind and degree of concentration. So clear has this proof been made that\r\nit was possible in experiments conducted apart from a host plant, to\r\nmake the hyphae on one side of an artificial membrane--_e.g._\r\ncollodion--penetrate it by placing one of these attractive\r\n(_chemotropic_) substances in suitable proportions on the other side.\r\nThe hyphae dissolved holes in the membrane by means of enzymes and\r\nplunged into the attractive substance on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sketch gives us a glimpse into the causes at work in\r\nparasitism.\r\n\r\nSuppose a fungus on the outside of the epidermis of a young organ--say a\r\nleaf. It may be unable to penetrate into the plant, and finding no\r\nsuitable food outside it dies: or it may be satisfied with the traces of\r\norganic matter on the epidermis and then lives the life of a saprophyte.\r\nOr it may be able to establish a hold-fast on the tender epidermal\r\nsurface, but without entering the cells, and irritate the developing\r\norgan by contact stimulation, inducing slight abnormalities; if in its\r\nfurther, purely superficial growth such an epiphyte covers large areas\r\nof the leaf, and especially if the hyphae are dark coloured--_e.g._\r\n_Dematium_ and other \"Sooty Moulds\"--injury may be done to the leaf\r\nowing to the shading action which deprives the chlorophyll below of its\r\nfull supply of solar energy. Some epiphytes, however, are able to fix\r\ntheir hyphae to the epidermis by sending minute peg-like projections\r\ninto the cuticle--_Trichosphaeria_, _Herpotrichia_--while others send\r\nhaustoria right through the outer epidermal walls--_e.g._\r\n_Erysiphe_--and thus supplement mere contact-irritation and shading by\r\nactual absorption from the external cells. Here the fungus is a\r\nparasitic epiphyte.\r\n\r\nA stage further is attained in those fungi which enter the stomata and\r\nlive in the intercellular spaces--_e.g._ many Uredineae and\r\n_Phytophthora_--and many such intercellular endophytes increase their\r\nattack on the cells by piercing their walls with minute (_Cystopus_) or\r\nlarge and branched (_Peronospora_) haustoria, or even eventually pierce\r\nthe cells and traverse them bodily (_Pythium_). In all these cases it is\r\nclear that conflicts must occur between poison and antidote, acid and\r\nalkali, attractive and repellent substances, enzyme and enzyme, etc., as\r\nwas hinted at above; and the same must take place when the parasite is\r\nendophytic and intracellular from the first, as in Chytridiaceae, etc.,\r\nthe zoospores of which pierce the outer cell-walls and forthwith grow\r\ninto the cells. There are also fungi which, while able to pierce the\r\nouter cell-walls, and grow forward in the thickness of the wall itself,\r\ncannot enter the living cells themselves--_e.g._ _Botrytis_. In the\r\nexample mentioned, the fungus excretes a poison, oxalic acid, which\r\nsoaks into and kills the cells next its point of attack: into these dead\r\ncells it then extends, and, invigorated by feeding on them, extends into\r\nother cell-walls and excretes more poison, and so on.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the foregoing it seems possible to sketch a general view\r\nof the nature of parasitism. In order that a fungus may enter the cells\r\nit must be able to overcome not only the resistance of the cell-walls,\r\nbut that of the living protoplasm also: if it cannot do the latter it\r\nmust remain outside, as a mere epiphyte, or at most an intercellular\r\nendophyte. If it can do neither it must either content itself with a\r\nsaprophytic existence or fail, so far as that particular host-plant is\r\nconcerned. Its inability to enter may be due to there being no\r\nchemotropic attraction, or to its incapacity to dissolve the cell-walls,\r\nor to the existence in the cell of some antagonistic substance which\r\nneutralises its acid secretions, destroys its enzymes or poisons, or is\r\neven directly poisonous to it.\r\n\r\nMoreover when once inside it does not follow that it can kill the cell.\r\nThe protoplasm of the latter may have been unable to prevent the fungus\r\nenemy from breaking through its first line of defence--the cell-wall,\r\nbut it may be quite capable of maintaining the fight at close quarters,\r\nand we see signs of the progress of the struggle in hypertrophy,\r\naccumulation of stores, and other changes in the invaded cells and their\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nFinally, the invested or invaded cell may so adapt itself to the demands\r\nof the invader that a sort of arrangement is arrived at by which life in\r\ncommon--_Symbiosis_--is established, each organism doing something for\r\nthe other and each taking something from the other. In this latter case,\r\nwhich is often realised--_e.g._ lichens, leguminous plants and the\r\norganisms in their root-nodules, mycorrhiza, etc.--we leave the domain\r\nof disease, which supervenes indeed if the other symbiont is lacking.\r\n\r\nSome interesting facts bearing on the matters here under discussion,\r\nhave been obtained from the study of _Galls_, the curious outgrowths\r\nfound on many plants and due to the action of insects.\r\n\r\nA typical gall exhibits three distinct and characteristic layers of\r\ntissue surrounding the hollow chamber in which the larva of the insect\r\nlies, viz., an outer layer of soft cells forming a parenchyma covered\r\nwith an epidermis, and frequently also with a layer of cork; an inner\r\nstratum consisting of very thin-walled delicate cells filled with\r\nprotoplasmic and reserve food-materials on which the larva feeds; and\r\nbetween the two a more or less definite layer of thick-walled\r\nsclerenchyma cells which serve as a protection against accidents to the\r\nlarva as the outer layer shrivels or rots, or if it is exposed to the\r\nattack of marauders. This layer may be absent from galls which have a\r\nshort life only. Vascular bundles run into the outer layer from the\r\nleaf-veins or the stele of the shoot, etc. Such galls abound in tannin,\r\nand are frequently of use in the arts on this account: they also contain\r\nstarch, and proteid substances and crystals of calcium oxalate. When the\r\nlarva has consumed the stores of food material and reached the adult\r\nstage it eats its way out and escapes.\r\n\r\nThe growth of such a gall is preceded by the laying of an egg on or in\r\nthe embryonic tissue of a leaf, stem, or other young part, and it is\r\ninteresting to note that only organs in the meristematic stage can form\r\ngalls, and that it is by no means necessary that the tissues should be\r\nwounded. Moreover, the egg as such is incapable of stimulating the plant\r\ntissues, but when it hatches, the resulting larva, beginning to feed on\r\nthe cells, irritates the tissues and rapid growth and cell-division\r\noccur, as in the case of other wounds or of fungus attacks. The actual\r\nwound made by the ovipositor heals up at once. It is evident from\r\nnumerous recent researches that these true galls are not due to any\r\npoisonous or irritating liquid injected by the parent, but that the\r\nstimulus to the tissue formation is similar to that exerted by a wound.\r\nThe young gall is in fact a callus enclosing the living larva, and it is\r\nthe continued irritation of the latter which keeps up the stimulation.\r\nThe final shape and constitution of the gall depend on mutual\r\nreactions--not as yet explained in detail--between the species of plant\r\nand the species of gall-insect concerned, as may readily be seen from\r\nthe extraordinary variations in size, shape, colouring, hairiness and\r\nother structural peculiarities of the galls on one species of, for\r\ninstance, the common oak. From what we have learnt about fungus\r\nparasites, however, there can be little doubt that reactions between the\r\ncells and the larva of the insect occur, resembling those which take\r\nplace between the cells and the hyphae of the fungus, and this is borne\r\nout by the study of other hypertrophies due to animals; _e.g._ Nematode\r\nworms in roots, and the remarkable galls--the simplest known--on\r\n_Vaucheria_, caused by the entrance into this alga of a species of\r\n_Notommata_, which induces a different gall on each of the various\r\nspecies of its host plants.\r\n\r\nIt must be concluded that the formation of the _Vaucheria_ gall is\r\ninduced by the mechanical irritation which the Rotifer causes in the\r\nprotoplasm. These galls are comparable to the hypertrophies in\r\n_Pilobolus_ caused by the presence of _Pleotrachelus_.\r\n\r\nAttempts to induce the development of galls artificially by injecting\r\nformic, acetic and other vegetable acids, poisons and other substances\r\ninto the tissues have, however, failed, and even the substances\r\ncontained in the insect or gall itself only produced negative results.\r\nNothing further was obtained than slight callus formations in some\r\ncases. Nor have experimenters succeeded in obtaining more than slight\r\ndistortions by fixing insects on the growing leaves in such positions\r\nthat they could scratch the epidermis.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore conclude that very complex interactions between the\r\nplant and insect are here concerned, among which may be the infiltration\r\nof some liquid from larva to plant--many of these gall larvae are\r\nstrongly scented, and Kustenmacher says that fluids excreted by the\r\nlarva are absorbed by the gall-tissue apparently as nutriment. This\r\nwould point to the symbiotic character of galls and their guests.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n     With regard to the action of poisons in small doses see\r\n     further Johannsen, _Das Aether-Verfahren beim Fruhtreiben_,\r\n     Jena, 1900, and, for _Botrytis_, see Marshall Ward, \"A Lily\r\n     Disease,\" _Annals of Botany_, Vol. II., 1889, p. 388.\r\n\r\n     The subject of enzymes has been exhaustively treated by Green,\r\n     _The Soluble Ferments and Fermentations_, Cambridge, 1899, to\r\n     which the reader is referred for literature.

The spores\r\nof fungi such as Rusts and Erysipheae are often carried from plant to\r\nplant by snails; those of root-destroying and tree-killing Polyporei by\r\nrabbits, rats, and other mammals which rub their fur against the\r\nhymenophores. Bees have been shown to carry the spores of _Sclerotinia_\r\nand infect the stigmas of Bilberries, etc., with them; and flies convey\r\nthe conidia of Ergot from grain to grain. Insects, indeed, of all kinds\r\nare great disseminators of disease--as witness also the part played by\r\nmosquitoes in transferring the malaria parasite to man--and beetles,\r\nbees, flies, etc., of all sorts probably play more active parts in this\r\nwork than has yet been proved, since they not only carry spores attached\r\nlike pollen to their hairy bodies, but in many cases in their alimentary\r\ncanal, to be spread later in the dung.\r\n\r\nThe part played by man in conveying fungi from plant to plant counts for\r\nmuch. Not only do gardeners and farm labourers carry spores on their\r\nboots and clothes as they pass from infected to non-infected areas, but\r\ncarted soil and manure are frequently infested with spores of Smuts,\r\n_Fusarium_, _Polyporus_, and the sclerotia or rhizomorphs of\r\n_Sclerotinia_, _Agaricus melleus_, _Dematophora_, etc. Man also sends\r\ndiseases through the post, and by rail and ship, by spores or mycelia\r\nattached to seedlings, bulbs, fruits, flowers, etc., as shown in several\r\ncases of potato, vine, hollyhock, lily, and hyacinth diseases. Every\r\ntime a carpenter saws a piece of fresh timber with the saw which has\r\nbeen used previously for cutting wood attacked with dry rot, he risks\r\ninfecting it with the fungus. Similarly in pruning: every cut with a\r\nknife which the gardener has used on infected branches may infect the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nCuttings made with a soil-contaminated knife and stuck into ordinary\r\nsoil in dirty boxes covered with equally dirty glass, present every\r\nchance for infection by soil organisms; bacteria and fungi obtain access\r\nto the vessels, and derive plenty of food from the juices, and the\r\nwonder is not that so many cuttings \"damp off,\" but that any are raised\r\nat all under ordinary conditions.\r\n\r\nThat worms bring buried spores to the surface can hardly be doubted\r\nafter Pasteur's experiments with Anthrax, and the principle of Darwin's\r\ndiscoveries of the important bearing of the habits of earthworms on this\r\nsubject, and that the soil attached to the feet of ducks and other birds\r\nteems with small seeds, applies to fungi also. Wind is also responsible\r\nfor distributing fungus-spores over wide areas, as may be easily proved\r\nby fixing a glass slide smeared with glycerine in the course of a breeze\r\npassing over an infected area.\r\n\r\nBut although the fungi are, generally speaking, passive in regard to\r\ntheir distribution, such is by no means always the case. Apart from the\r\nfact that some forms attract insects by means of honey dew (Ergot), or\r\nby sweet odours (Spermogonia, _Sclerotinia_), the zoospores of\r\n_Pythium_, _Phytophthora_, etc., are motile, and although they cannot\r\nmove far in the films of water in which they travel, nevertheless in a\r\nwet potato field, with the wind flapping the leaves one against the\r\nother, some dissemination of importance must be actively brought about,\r\nand similarly with the amoebae of _Plasmodiophora_ in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe shooting of ascospores into the air by certain species of _Peziza_,\r\nfrom the discs of which the spores may be seen to puff out in clouds,\r\naffords further evidence that fungi cannot be regarded as entirely\r\npassive in respect to distribution of their spores. But when we come to\r\ncertain of the soil fungi--_e.g._ _Agaricus melleus_, _Dematophora_,\r\netc.--the active creeping forward by growth in the soil of their\r\nrhizomorphs and mycelial strands afford examples of active spreading of\r\nconsiderable importance in the vineyard and forest, since they pass from\r\nroot to root and from tree to tree and may infect the entire area in\r\ncourse of time.\r\n\r\nNot the least significant mode of dissemination is that by which what I\r\nhave termed \"lurking parasites\" are spread: such are fungi which attach\r\nthemselves to the seeds, fruits, tubers, etc., of other plants and so\r\nobtain all the advantages of being carried and sown with the\r\nlatter--_e.g._ Ustilagineae and Uredineae which adhere to grain,\r\n_Verticillium_, _Nectria_, etc., in potatoes and other plants.\r\n\r\nThe spread of diseases due to animals, especially insects, is of course\r\nmore active, in consequence of the motility of the distributing agents.\r\nThis is most marked in the winged species, of which locusts, beetles,\r\nmoths and butterflies, flies and wasps furnish well-known examples; and\r\nis not inconsiderable in the case of wingless and merely creeping\r\nspecies. It is noteworthy that many forms wingless in the parasitic\r\nstage are winged at certain periods, _e.g._ the females of _Phylloxera_.\r\n\r\nThat man also spreads insect pests is well known and acted upon, as\r\nwitness the phylloxera laws--which, however, it is to be feared too\r\noften only illustrate once more the adage concerning the shutting of the\r\nstable door after the horse has gone.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to attempt anything like a complete account of the\r\nestimates of loss in different countries, due to the ravages of insects\r\nand fungi, but the following examples should surely serve to convince\r\nanyone of the magnitude of these losses and of the economic importance\r\nof the whole question, and the reader may be referred to the special\r\nliterature for further details.\r\n\r\nThe coffee leaf-disease of Ceylon, due to the fungus _Hemileia_, is\r\nestimated to have cost that Colony considerably over L1,000,000 per\r\nannum for several years. One estimate puts the loss in ten years at from\r\nL12,000,000 to L15,000,000. The hop-aphis is estimated to have cost Kent\r\nL2,700,000 in the year 1882. In 1874 the Agricultural Commissioner of\r\nthe United States estimated the annual loss, due to the ravages of\r\ninsects on cotton alone, to amount to L5,000,000; and in 1882 the annual\r\nloss to the United States due to insects, calculated for all kinds of\r\nagricultural produce, was put at the appalling figure of from\r\nL40,000,000 to L60,000,000 sterling. In India, the annual loss due to\r\nwheat-rust alone has recently been estimated at 4,000,000 to 20,000,000\r\nrupees, and one insect alone is said to have cost the cotton planters a\r\nquarter of the crop--valued at seven crores of rupees--in bad years.\r\nSimilarly, in Australia the annual loss from wheat-rust has been put at\r\nfrom L2,000,000 to L3,000,000. In 1891 the loss in Prussia alone from\r\ngrain-rusts was officially estimated at over L20,000,000 sterling. Need\r\nmore be said? Even allowing for considerable exaggerations in such\r\nestimates it is clear that the damage to crops in any country soon\r\namounts to sums which even at low rates of interest would easily yield\r\nincomes capable of supporting the best equipped laboratories and staffs\r\nfor investigations directed to the explanation of the phenomena in\r\ndetail, the sole basis on which intelligent preventive and therapeutic\r\nmeasures can be based. But it is far from likely that the estimates are\r\nexaggerated. The planting and agricultural communities are as a rule\r\nopposed to the publication of statistics--or at least have been so in\r\nvarious countries and at different times--and if we knew the damage done\r\nto all crops even in our own Empire, the results would probably astonish\r\nus far more than the above figures have done.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n     On the dissemination of fungi, the reader will find Fulton,\r\n     \"Dispersal of the Spores of Fungi by the Agency of Insects,\"\r\n     _Ann.

It was stated at\r\nthe time that this disease had been known for some time in Belgium, in\r\nCanada and the United States, in Ireland, in the Isle of Thanet, and in\r\nother parts of the world. Similar, but less devastating epidemics have\r\noccurred in various years since. It was generally noticed during such\r\nepidemics that the plants themselves were full of foliage, surcharged\r\nwith moisture, and of a luxuriant green colour promising abundant\r\ncrops. The now well-known spots, at first pale and then brown and\r\nfringed with a whitish mould-like growth--the conidiophores of the\r\n_Phytophthora_--were observed during the dull cloudy and wet weather,\r\ncooler than usual, when the atmosphere was saturated for days together,\r\nin July and August. The actual amount of rain does not appear to have\r\nbeen excessive, but most observers seem to agree that dull weather with\r\nmoist air had succeeded a warm forcing period of growth. So rapidly did\r\nthe disease run its course that in a few days nearly all the plants were\r\na rotting blackened mass in the fields, and the potatoes dug up\r\nafterwards were either already rotten or soon became so in the stores.\r\nFurther experience has confirmed this, and we now know that the epidemic\r\nis very apt to appear in any region where potatoes are grown on a large\r\nscale, in dull moist weather, especially in fields exposed to mists,\r\nheavy dews, etc., about July and August, when the foliage is full and\r\nturgid. Similarly on heavy wet soils, unless the season is remarkably\r\nopen and dry; but also on dry light soils in rainy seasons. So evident\r\nwas this that many believed that the mists and dew brought the\r\ndisease--harking back to the superstitions of earlier days. We must\r\nremember that prior to 1860 the life-history of _Phytophthora_ was not\r\nknown. Since De Bary's proof of the germination of the zoospores and of\r\nthe infection of the leaves, the course of the hyphae in them and in the\r\nhaulms, the origin of the conidia, etc., and the confirmation by\r\nnumerous competent observers of the true fungus nature of this disease,\r\nwe are now in a position to understand the principal factors of the\r\nvarious epidemics of potato disease.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely that the potato-fields afford plenty of food for the\r\nfungus, and that the dull weather causes the tissues to be surcharged\r\nwith moisture, owing to diminished transpiration, but the mists and\r\ndew--to say nothing of actual rain and the flapping of wet\r\nleaves--favour the germination and spread of the zoospores throughout\r\nthe field. Whether the dull light also favours the accumulation of\r\nsugars in the tissues, and the partial etiolation of the latter implies\r\nless resistance to the entering hyphae, may be passed over here, but in\r\nany case it is clear that we have several factors of the non-living\r\nenvironment here favouring the parasite and not improving the chances\r\nof the host, even if they do not directly disfavour it.\r\n\r\nAs another instance I will take the Larch-disease, which is due to the\r\nravages of a Peziza (_Dasyscypha Willkommii_) the hyphae of which obtain\r\naccess by wounds to the sieve-tubes and cambium of the stem, and\r\ngradually kill them over a larger and larger area and so ring the tree,\r\nwith the symptoms of canker described below.\r\n\r\nNow the Larch fungus is also to be found on trees in their Alpine home,\r\nbut there it does very little damage and never becomes epidemic except\r\nin certain sheltered regions near lakes and in other damp situations.\r\nHow then are we to explain the extensive ravages of the Larch disease\r\nover the whole of Europe during the latter half of this century? The\r\nextensive planting, providing large supplies for the fungus, does not\r\nsuffice to explain it, because there are large areas of pure Larch in\r\nthe Alps which do not suffer.\r\n\r\nIn its mountain home the Larch loses its leaves in September and remains\r\nquiescent through the intensely cold winter, until May. Then come the\r\nshort spring and rapid passage to summer, and the Larch buds open with\r\nremarkable celerity when they do begin--_i.e._ when the roots are\r\nthoroughly awakened to activity. Hence the tender period of young\r\nfoliage is reduced to a minimum, and any agencies which can only injure\r\nthe young leaves and shoots in the tender stage must do their work in a\r\nfew days, or the opportunity is gone, and the tree passes forthwith\r\ninto its summer state.\r\n\r\nIn the plains, on the contrary, the Larch begins to open at varying\r\ndates from March to May, and during the tardy spring encounters all\r\nkinds of vicissitudes in the way of frosts and cold winds following on\r\nwarm days which have started the root-action--for we must bear in mind\r\nthat the roots are more easily awakened after our warmer winters than is\r\nsafe for the tree.\r\n\r\nIt amounts to this, therefore, that in the plains the long continued\r\nperiod of foliation allows insects, frost, winds, etc., some six weeks\r\nor two months in which to injure the slowly sprouting tender shoots,\r\nwhereas in the mountain heights they have only a fortnight or so in\r\nwhich to do such damage. That the lower altitude and longer summer are\r\nnot in themselves inimical to Larch is proved by the splendid growths\r\nmade by the trees first planted a century ago. Then came the epidemic of\r\nLarch-disease: the fungus, which is merely endemic--_i.e._ obtains a\r\nlivelihood here and there on odd trees, or groups of trees in warmer or\r\ndamper nooks--in the Alps, was favoured by the more numerous points of\r\nattack afforded to its spores by injuries due to insects--_Coleophora_,\r\n_Chermes_, etc.--and frost wounds, as well as by the longer periods of\r\nmoist dull weather, and the longer season of foliation. Moreover, as\r\ntime went on almost every consignment of young Larch-trees sent abroad\r\nwas already infected. Here again, then, we find the factors of an\r\nepidemic consisting in events which favour the reproduction and spread\r\nof a fungus more than they do the well-being of the host.\r\n\r\nAs a third illustration I will take the case of an insect epidemic. In\r\n1863 a disease was observed on vines in the South of France which\r\nfrightened the growers as they realised its destructive effects: the\r\nroots decayed and the leaves turned yellow and died before the grapes\r\nripened, and such vines threw out fewer and feebler shoots the following\r\nyear, and often none at all afterwards. In 1865 the disease was\r\nevidently becoming epidemic near Bordeaux, and in 1868 it was shown to\r\nbe due to an insect, _Phylloxera_, the female of which lays its eggs on\r\nthe roots, where they hatch. The louse-like offspring sticks its\r\nproboscis into the tissues as far as the central cylinder. The irritated\r\npericycle and cortex then grow and form nodules of soft juicy\r\nroot-tissue at which the insect continues to suck. Rapid reproduction\r\nresults in the majority of the young rootlets being thus attacked, and\r\nsince they cannot form their normal periderm and harden off properly\r\nthey rot, and admit fungi and other evils, in consequence of which the\r\nvine suffers also in the parts above ground.\r\n\r\nEvidence that the general damage is due to the diminished root-action is\r\nfound in the peculiarly dry poor wood formed in the \"canes\" of diseased\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nBy 1877 the epidemic had spread to the northern limits of the French\r\nvineyards, and by 1888 half the vines in the country were attacked, and\r\nthe yield of wine reduced from half a million hectolitres to 50,000\r\nonly. Meanwhile the disease had spread to Italy, Germany, Madeira,\r\nPortugal, and even to the Cape, though not in epidemic form as in the\r\nBordeaux centre whence it spread.\r\n\r\nNow it appears that _Phylloxera_ has long been in the habit of doing\r\ndamage to vines in America, where, however, it attacks the leaves, on\r\nwhich it makes pocket-like galls, rather than the roots. Moreover, there\r\nare species and varieties of American vines which, even when planted in\r\nEurope, do not suffer at all from this insect at the roots, either\r\nbecause the rootlets do not push out at the same season as those of the\r\nEuropean form, or because they form wood more rapidly and completely, or\r\nsecrete resinous and other matters distasteful to the insect in greater\r\nquantity and are thus capable of healing the wounds, or in some other\r\nway they do not respond to the attack or suit the insect. In any case\r\nthe attack on the leaf rather than the root seems to be the exception in\r\nEuropean vineyards and the rule in American species, and we appear to be\r\nface to face with a problem of specific predisposition to this\r\nparticular malady. That the resistant properties of the vines of\r\nAmerica--not all, only particular species and varieties are thus\r\n\"immune\"--can be utilised has been proved by European growers; and not\r\nonly so, for Millardet and others have shown that the European vine\r\ngrafted on to these resistant stocks suffer less than when on their own\r\nroots. It has also been shown that hybrids can be obtained which are\r\nresistant.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious point of all is that _Phylloxera_ was itself a\r\nnative of America, and came thence to Europe. It had played its part\r\nwith certain fungi in ruining all the attempts to introduce the European\r\nvine into America many years ago. A recent authority on the evolution of\r\nAmerican fruits writes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"All the most amenable types of grapes had long since perished in the\r\nstruggle for existence, and the types which now persist are necessarily\r\nthose which are, from their very make-up or constitution, almost immune\r\nfrom injury, or are least liable to attack . . . the _Phylloxera_ finds\r\ntough rations on the hard, cord-like roots of any of our eastern species\r\nof grapes. But an unnaturalised and unsophisticated foreigner, being\r\nunused to the enemy and undefended, falls a ready victim; or if the\r\nenemy is transported to a foreign country the same thing occurs.\"\r\n\r\nFurther proof that it is in the \"constitution\" of the European vine that\r\nthe want of resistance to _Phylloxera_ resides, is furnished by the fact\r\nthat in California and the Pacific states the European vine was\r\nintroduced with more success, but is now suffering badly because\r\n_Phylloxera_ has spread there also. It must not be overlooked, however,\r\nthat we are as yet very ignorant of all that is implied in the word\r\n\"constitution\" as used above.\r\n\r\nIf we enquire further why the _Phylloxera_ epidemic was so much worse\r\nin the Southern vineyards than in the more Northern ones of Germany, the\r\nopinion seems to prevail that the warmer climates favour the insect.\r\nFurther, it appears that, in Italy, the vines in loose open soil,\r\nprovided it is equally rich in mineral food-materials and offers no\r\ndisadvantages as regards drainage, suffer less than those in closer\r\nsoils, the reasons alleged being that the young roots can push out more\r\nrapidly and widely, and so obtain holdfasts with greater distances\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n     The student may obtain further information on the history of\r\n     the Potato disease by consulting the following: Berkeley,\r\n     \"Observations, Botanical and Physiological, on the Potato\r\n     Murrain,\" _Journal of the Horticultural Society_, Vol. I.,\r\n     1846, p. 9; De Bary, _Die Gegenwaertig herrschende Kartoffel\r\n     Krankheit_, etc., Leipzic, 1861; and the pages of the\r\n     _Gardeners' Chronicle_ from 1860-1900.\r\n\r\n     For the Larch disease he should consult Hartig, _Unters. aus\r\n     der Foist.

Every cultivator learns by\r\nexperience or by precept that there are some things he must avoid in\r\ndealing with certain plants, or otherwise they will not succeed; in\r\nother words they will succumb to diseased conditions and die. It is\r\npartly owing to the want of systematisation of this knowledge, and its\r\nextension in other directions, that such extraordinary blunders are made\r\nin ignorant practice, and trees for instance are planted in low-lying\r\nfrost beds which would succeed in slightly higher situations, or seeds\r\nsubject to damping-off are sown in beds rife with the spores of\r\n_Peronospora_ or _Pythium_, and so forth.\r\n\r\nMany diseases, however, are not preventible in the present state of our\r\nknowledge, or prevailing conditions are such that the risk must be run\r\nof endemic diseases gradually becoming epidemic, and thus the natural\r\ndesire for some means of checking the ravages of some pest or another\r\nhas led to innumerable trials to minimise the effects by prophylactic\r\nmeasures. The procedure almost invariably followed where parasites are\r\nconcerned, consists in either dusting the plants with some chemical in\r\nthe form of a powder, or spraying it with a liquid, or occasionally in\r\nenveloping the plant in some gas, in each case poisonous to the insect-\r\nor fungus-pest. The principal rules to be observed are: (1) the poison\r\nemployed must be sufficiently strong or concentrated to kill the\r\nparasite, but not sufficiently powerful to injure the host; (2) it must\r\nbe applied at the right period, as suggested by a knowledge of the\r\nlife-history of the fungus or insect in question.\r\n\r\nObviously it is of no use to apply such topical remedies to a parasite\r\nwhile it is spending the greater part of its life inside the tissues of\r\nthe host. Further, questions of expense of the materials employed and of\r\nthe labour of applying them help to limit the adoption of such measures.\r\n\r\nAmong the various kinds of powders employed, finely divided sulphur, or\r\na mixture of sulphur and lime, have been used with success in some\r\ncases--_e.g._ against Hop mildew and other epiphytic Erysipheae, and\r\nagainst red spider, aphides, etc., the gaseous sulphur dioxide evolved\r\nbeing the efficacious agent. In other cases pyrethrum or tobacco powder,\r\nwood ashes, etc., have been employed against insects. Such powders are\r\napplied by hand or by means of bellows, and are very easily manipulated\r\nin most cases, though, like all such applications, the dangers of\r\nconcentration at particular spots owing to uneven distribution, or of\r\ndilution and washing off by rain, have to be incurred.\r\n\r\nFar more numerous are the various liquids which have been employed for\r\nwashing, spraying, or steeping the affected parts of diseased plants.\r\nWater alone, or aqueous decoctions or emulsions of various\r\nkinds--_e.g._, quassia, tobacco, soap, or aloes, have been widely\r\nemployed against insects such as green fly, red spider, etc. In\r\ngreenhouses, where the leaves can be washed by hand or thoroughly\r\nsyringed, and the concentration and time of action thoroughly\r\ncontrolled, such liquids are often serviceable, but great practical\r\ndifficulties are apt to interfere with their use in the open field.\r\n\r\nThe principal liquids employed against fungi have been copper sulphate\r\nand other metallic compounds (Bordeaux mixture, Eau Celeste, etc.),\r\nvarious compounds of arsenic (_e.g._ \"Paris green\"), potassium sulphite,\r\npermanganate, etc., and emulsions of carbolic acid, petroleum, and such\r\nlike antiseptics, for the exact composition of which the special\r\ntreatises must be consulted. Some of these, especially Bordeaux mixture,\r\nhave been experimented with on a very large scale, especially in\r\nAmerica, and various forms of spraying machines have been introduced for\r\ndealing with large areas.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that these spraying operations are more particularly adapted\r\nto field crops such as Turnips, Hops, Vines, Potatoes, and to garden and\r\ngreenhouse plants than to woods and plantations; as a rule they cannot\r\nbe applied to forest trees--though they have been used in orchards--or\r\nto roots, seeds, and other parts in the soil, and many special forms of\r\ntreatment have been devised for particular cases of these kinds.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest of these is the steeping of grain in solutions of\r\ncopper, or in hot water, just before sowing, and the practical\r\neradication of Bunt and, partially, of Smut is due to this practice,\r\nwhich has lately been adapted to potatoes, the principle being that the\r\nparasitic germs shall be killed while still adhering to the outside of\r\nthe seeds, tubers, etc., before germination. \"Finger and Toe\" due to\r\n_Plasmodiophora_ has been successfully dealt with by the application of\r\nlime, but we do not know whether the effect is owing to indirect actions\r\nin the soil, to direct actions on the plasmodia, or to the increased\r\nproduction of root-hairs induced by liming.\r\n\r\n_Phylloxera_ has been treated by plunging into the soil near the roots\r\nsmall blocks of some slowly-soluble medium, such as gelatine,\r\nimpregnated with carbon-bisulphide, the volatile fumes of which kill the\r\ninsect, and even more drastic remedies have been tried along similar\r\nlines. In America orchard trees infested with insects or fungi have been\r\ncovered one by one with light tents, and the vapours of prussic acid,\r\nburning sulphur, and other poisons allowed to act inside the tent. In\r\nall such cases it must be remembered that uncontrolled ignorance of the\r\nproperties of poisons on the part of the operator may lead to disaster,\r\nand the same applies to the much easier treatment of greenhouses, and\r\ncases where poisoned food is laid about for insects or vermin.\r\n\r\nAttempts, not altogether unsuccessful on the small scale, have also been\r\nmade to introduce epidemic diseases among rats, mice, and locusts and\r\nother insects, by inoculating some of them with parasitic bacteria or\r\nfungi (_Empusa_, _Isaria_, etc.), and then allowing them to run loose in\r\nthe hope that they will communicate the disease to their fellows. The\r\nintroduction of lady-birds into districts infested with Coccideae and\r\nsimilar pests which they devour, is also recorded as successful, as also\r\nthe importation of birds into forests plagued with caterpillars. It must\r\nnot be over-looked, however, that man's interference with the existing\r\nbalance of events in the natural struggle for existence is occasionally\r\ndisastrous, as witness the results of importing rabbits into Australia,\r\ngoats into the Canary Islands, and sparrows in various countries.\r\nDarwin's well-known illustration of the inter-relations between clover,\r\nbees, field-mice, and cats (_Orig. of Species_, 6th ed., 1876, p. 57),\r\nwhich shows the astounding probability of the dependence of such a plant\r\non the number of cats in the neighbourhood, well illustrates the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nMere mention must be made of other special treatments.\r\n\r\nCaterpillars and larger animals are often picked by hand or their\r\nnatural enemies--_e.g._ birds, are encouraged in forests. Locusts are\r\ncaught in nets, trenches, etc., and buried. Woodlice, slugs, etc., are\r\noften trapped by laying attractive food such as carrots and overhauling\r\nthe traps daily: similarly with earwigs. Rings of tar round tree stems\r\nhave been employed to prevent caterpillars creeping up them.\r\n\r\nAmerican Blight has been treated by rapidly flaming the stems. Syringing\r\nwith hot water has also been employed for vines affected with mildew,\r\nmealy bug, etc.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the alleged immunity from devouring insects of certain\r\npoisonous plants, it has been pointed out that _Pangium edule_, which\r\nabounds in prussic acid, is infested with a grub, and ivy is\r\noccasionally eaten by caterpillars.\r\n\r\nAnother point as regards insect pests is the well-known destructive\r\neffect of a cold, wet spring on the young larvae. The use of cyanide of\r\npotassium requires especial care, but has been described as easily\r\ncarried out with success in greenhouses.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that lady-birds, the larvae of wasp-flies and\r\nlace-wings, and ichneumon-flies as well as wrens can keep down aphides.\r\n\r\nFor an example of the treatment of a complex case of \"chlorosis\" with\r\nmineral manures, the reader may consult the _Gardeners' Chronicle_, 1899\r\n(July), p. 405. Many similar cases have been recorded, but it should not\r\nbe overlooked that very complex inter-relations are here involved.\r\n\r\nCharlock has been successfully dealt with by applying 5 lbs. of copper\r\nsulphate in 25 gallons of water to each acre of land while the weeds are\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the guiding idea is derived from accurate knowledge\r\nof the habits of the insect, fungus, or pest concerned, and obviously\r\nthe procedure must be timed accordingly. It is a particular case of the\r\nstruggle for existence, where man steps in as a third and (so to speak)\r\nunexpected living agent.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from our study of the factors of an epidemic that one of the\r\nprimary conditions which favour the spread of any disease is provided\r\nby growing any crop continuously in \"pure culture\" over large areas.\r\nThis is sufficiently exemplified by the disastrous spread of such\r\ndiseases as Wheat-rust, Larch-disease, Potato-disease, Phylloxera,\r\nHop-disease, Sugar-cane disease, Coffee-leaf disease, and numerous other\r\nmaladies which have now become historic in agricultural, planting, and\r\nforest annals. Providing the favourite food-supply in large quantities\r\nis not the only factor of an epidemic, but it is a most important one in\r\nthat it not only facilitates the growth and reproduction of a pest, but\r\naffords it every opportunity of spreading rapidly and widely.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Nature herself shows us that such pests are kept in check in\r\nher domain by the struggle for existence entailed by innumerable\r\nbarriers and competitors. As matter of experience also it is found that\r\nrotation of crops, planting forests of mixed species, and breaking up\r\nlarge areas of cultivation into plantations, fields, etc., of different\r\nspecies afford natural and often efficient checks to the ravages of\r\nfungus and insect pests. Over and over again it has been found that a\r\nfungus or an insect which is merely endemic so long as it is isolated in\r\nthe forest, where its host is separated from other plants of the same\r\nspecies by other plants which it cannot attack, becomes epidemic when\r\nlet loose on the continuous acres so beloved of the planter. And the\r\nsame reasoning applies to the success of such pests on open areas from\r\nwhich the birds or other enemies of the pest have been driven. True, we\r\ncannot always trace the tangled skein of inter-relationships between one\r\norganism and another in Nature: the recognition of the principle of\r\nnatural selection and the struggle for existence is too recent, and our\r\nstudies of natural history as yet too imperfect to lay all the factors\r\nclear, but no observant and thoughtful man can avoid the truth of the\r\ngeneral principle here laid down. The history of all great planting\r\nenterprises teaches us that he who undertakes to cultivate any plant\r\ncontinuously in open culture over large areas must run the risk of\r\nepidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n     The principal literature, now very voluminous, on this subject\r\n     is contained in the publications of the U.S. Department of\r\n     Agriculture from 1890 onwards. See especially _Bulletins_,\r\n     Nos. 3, 6, and 9; _Farmers' Bulletin_, No. 91, 1899; and _The\r\n     Journal of Mycology_ during the same period. See also Lodeman,\r\n     _The Spraying of Plants_, London, 1896. A summary of the\r\n     principal processes will be found in Massee, _Text-Book of\r\n     Plant Diseases_, pp. 31-47.\r\n\r\n     With regard to the history of the subject, which still needs\r\n     writing, the reader should not overlook Roberts, \"On the\r\n     Therapeutical Action of Sulphur,\" _St. George's Hospital\r\n     Reports_, date unknown, but subsequent to the following:\r\n     Berkeley, _Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany_, 1857, p. 277,\r\n     with references. These are, I believe, with the references to\r\n     steeping of wheat in De Bary, _Unters. ueber d. Brandpilze_,\r\n     Berlin, 1853, among the first attempts to utilise such\r\n     remedies.\r\n\r\n     Further facts will be found in the pages of the _Gardeners'\r\n     Chronicle_, especially since 1890, and in _Zeitsch. f.\r\n     Pflanzen-krankheiten_ since 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nVARIATION AND DISEASE.\r\n\r\n     _Predisposition and immunity--Pathological conditions\r\n     vary--Hardy varieties--\"Disease-proof\" varieties--Disease\r\n     dodging--Thick skins--Indian wheats, etc. Cell-contents\r\n     vary--Citrus, Cinchona, Almonds, etc. Double ideals in\r\n     selection--Cultivation of pest and host-plant--Variations of\r\n     fungi--Bacteria--Specialised races--Difficulties--Experiment\r\n     only will solve the problems._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numerous and often expensive failures in the application of any\r\nprophylactic treatment, have proved an acute stimulus to the research\r\nfor other ways of combating the ravages of plant diseases. It is a\r\nmatter of every-day experience that particular varieties of cultivated\r\nplants may suffer less from a given disease than others in the same\r\ndistrict; also that one and the same species may suffer badly in one\r\ncountry and not in another--_e.g._ the Larch in the lowlands of Europe\r\nas contrasted with the same tree in its Alpine home, and the various\r\nspecies of American Vines in Europe.\r\n\r\nThese matters, in the hands of astute observers, are turning the\r\nattention of cultivators and experts to new aspects of the question of\r\nplant diseases, namely, the possible existence of immunity, and the\r\nbreeding of disease-proof varieties; and the existence on the part of\r\nthe host plant of predispositions to disease which may depend on some\r\nfactors in the plant or in the environment over which it is possible to\r\nexercise control, or which, if known, can be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe matter is complicated by the recent demonstration of the fact that\r\nparasites also vary and can adapt themselves to altered conditions, as\r\nis shown by the history of the coffee-leaf disease (_Hemileia_) in\r\nCeylon, and by Eriksson's results with Wheat-rusts (_Puccinia_) and\r\nvarious experiments with _Coleosporium_ and other Uredineae; but there\r\nare good grounds for concluding that hybridisation, grafting, and\r\nselection of varieties may do much towards the establishment of races\r\nwhich will resist particular diseases, as shown by Millardet's\r\nexperiments with Vines, and the results obtained by Cobb and others with\r\nWheat.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with so-called \"disease-proof varieties\" is to test\r\nthem under similar conditions in different countries, and for a\r\nsufficient period of time. A particular race of Wheat may behave very\r\ndifferently in Norfolk, Devonshire, and Northumberland, and the recent\r\nintroduction of the purely experimental method in this connection is a\r\nmarked advance. However rough the experiments may of necessity have to\r\nbe, it is only by such means that data can be gradually accumulated.\r\n\r\nHaving now obtained some insight into the factors concerned in disease,\r\nlet us enquire further into the bearing of variation on these. It is\r\nevident that pathological conditions may vary; indeed they are\r\nthemselves symptoms of variation, as we have seen. The history of all\r\nour cultivated plants shows abundantly that many of the variations\r\nobtained by breeding in our gardens, orchards, fields, etc., involve\r\ndifferences of response on the part of the plant to the very agencies\r\nwhich induce disease. Every year the florists' catalogues offer new\r\n\"hardy\" varieties; but a hardy variety is simply, for our present\r\npurpose, one which succumbs less readily to frost, cutting winds, cold\r\ndamp weather, and so forth. If anyone doubts that hardy varieties have\r\nbeen gradually bred by selection, I refer him to the evidence collected\r\nby De Candolle, Darwin, Wallace, Bailey and others. When we come to\r\nenquire into the causes of \"hardiness,\" however, difficulties at once\r\nbeset us. The adaptation may express itself in a difference in the time\r\nof flowering or leafing, the exigencies of the season being \"dodged,\" as\r\nit were, in a manner which was impossible with the original stock, as\r\nappears to have occurred with Peaches in America; or it may be expressed\r\nin deeper rooting, as is said to be the case in some Apples, or in the\r\nacquirement of a more deciduous habit, or in actually increased\r\nresistance to low temperatures. In such cases we cannot trace what\r\nalterations have occurred in the cells and tissues concerned, though we\r\nmay be sure that some changes do occur.\r\n\r\nNo experienced cultivator doubts that some varieties of Potato, Wheat,\r\nVine, Chrysanthemum, etc., suffer more from epidemic diseases than\r\nothers, and our yearly catalogues furnish us with plenty of promises of\r\n\"disease-proof\" varieties. Here also we may imagine several ways in\r\nwhich a particular variety may resist or escape the epidemic attacks of\r\nfungi which in the same neighbourhood decimate other varieties. If we\r\ncould breed a variety of the Larch which opened its buds later than the\r\nordinary form in our northern plains, the probability of its escaping\r\nthe Larch-disease would be increased in proportion to the shortness of\r\nthe period of tender foliation described on p. 153. It has been claimed\r\nfor certain varieties of Wheat that increased thickness of the cuticle\r\nand fewer stomata per square unit of surface have diminished the risk of\r\ninfection by Rust fungi, and for certain varieties of Potato, that the\r\nthicker periderm of the tuber protects them against fungi in the soil.\r\nThat certain thick-skinned Apples, Tomatoes, and Plums pack and store\r\nbetter than those with a more tender epidermis seems proved--that is to\r\nsay, they suffer less from fungi which gain access through bruises and\r\nother wounds; but it cannot be said that any convincing proof is yet to\r\nhand explaining in detail why some races of wheat resist Rust, or why\r\nthe roots of American Vines suffer less from _Phylloxera_ than others.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary cases known to me in this connection is\r\nthe unconscious selection on the part of native Indian cultivators,\r\nperfectly ignorant of the principles involved, of spring and autumn\r\nforms of Rice, Wheat, Castor Oil, Sugar Cane, Cotton, and other crops.\r\n\"It has been estimated that Bengal alone possesses as many as 10,000\r\nrecognisable forms of rice.\" Now there is not the slightest ground for\r\ndoubt that these have been unconsciously bred from the semi-aquatic\r\nnative species during the many centuries of Indian agriculture, and\r\nnevertheless they have, among other peculiar races, some hill-breeds\r\nwhich they cultivate on dry soils and without direct inundation. That is\r\nto say, they possess tropical and temperate races differing far more\r\nthan our spring and summer wheats.\r\n\r\nSomething has been gained, then, if we can show that there is nothing\r\nabsurd or hopeless in the search for disease-proof or resistant races,\r\nand I think this can be done. We must not forget that the ideal usually\r\nset before himself by a breeder of plants has hitherto been almost\r\nexclusively some standard of size, form, colouring, and so forth, of the\r\nflower, or of taste and texture of the fruit, tuber, etc., though\r\nexperiments with _Cinchona_, with brewery yeasts, and other plants\r\nremind us that variations in other directions have been attended to\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nNow it is obvious that in breeding sour limes and sweet oranges the\r\ncultivator is selecting, and intensifying by selection, very different\r\nmetabolic processes in the cell: he can test the results of these, and\r\nso the selection proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe question is, Could he select at the same time those variations in\r\ncell activity which express themselves in properties of the flower,\r\nfruit, foliage, etc., he desires, as well as such variations as aid the\r\ncells in repelling fungi, insects, or exigencies of the non-living\r\nenvironment?\r\n\r\nThat more or less disease-proof varieties could be selected if that\r\nobject alone were kept in view can hardly be doubted; plenty of examples\r\nexist already which show that the necessary variations to work upon\r\nexist in just those secretions of protoplasm, etc., which we have seen\r\nare concerned in repelling or attracting parasites.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Almond has lost the power of producing amygdalin and prussic\r\nacid in its cells; Cinchona plants vary immensely in the quantity of\r\nquinine formed, and in European hot-houses may even form none at all;\r\nsome varieties of Maize have sugar and dextrine instead of starch in\r\ntheir endosperms, or coloured instead of clear sap in the aleurone\r\nlayer, and recent researches prove that they can transmit these\r\npeculiarities to hybrid offspring; non-poisonous bacteria have\r\nfrequently been got from poisonous species simply by cultivation under\r\nspecial conditions, and pigmented forms can be bred into non-pigmented\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nBut we see that the difficulty of selection is increased in the case\r\npostulated above, because two ideals are to be worked up to, and they\r\nmay conceivably be incompatible. Not necessarily so, however, for\r\nbreeders have solved such problems before in obtaining early _and_ heavy\r\ncropping races of potatoes, wheat, etc., sweet _and_ large grapes,\r\nstrawberries, etc., hardy _and_ brilliant flowers, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another aspect of this question of variability in\r\norganisms in this connection to be considered. Ever since cultivation\r\nbegan man has probably been cultivating not only the crops he desires,\r\nbut also the pests which infest them, and if variation of his chosen\r\nplants occurs--and no one will deny that--surely variation of the fungi\r\nand insects which live on them also takes place. That this is so can be\r\ndemonstrated, though, since it is not part of my theme to go into the\r\nquestion of peculiarities of species and races of parasites, the subject\r\nmust here be passed over with a few remarks only.\r\n\r\nRecent researches have shown not only that fungi vary immensely in form\r\nand morphological characters according to the amount and kind of\r\nfood-materials put at their disposal, thus bringing the whole question\r\nof polymorphism into the domain of experimental physiology, but that\r\ntheir capacities for infection, spore formation, etc., are also capable\r\nof variation and are dependent on the quality and quantity of food\r\nsupplies, water, as well as on the temperature, illumination, and other\r\nfactors of the environment. This is true of parasites as well as of\r\nsaprophytes. _Botrytis_ forms conidia only in darkness and in moist air.\r\nKlebahn found that a _Puccinia_ growing on _Digraphis_ infected\r\n_Polygonatum_ readily and completely, _Convallaria_ imperfectly, whereas\r\nif sown on _Majanthemum_ it only just infected the plant and then\r\nremained sterile, while it refused to infect _Paris_ at all. Magnus has\r\nshown that _Peronospora parasitica_ can only infect meristematic\r\ntissues, and that when it co-exists with _Cystopus_ on _Capsella_, as is\r\nusually the case, it enters the latter plant by infecting the gall-like\r\npustules of hypertrophied tissue induced by that parasite. Numerous\r\nparasitic fungi can only penetrate particular parts of plants. For\r\ninstance, the _Ustilago_ of wheat can only infect the young seedling,\r\nand grows for weeks as a barren mycelium, only becoming a dominant\r\nfungus in the endosperm. Numerous other examples could be given, but\r\nthese suffice to show some of the ways in which the nature of the food\r\nsubstratum supplied by the host affects the fungus. It is obvious that\r\nif the nature of this food changes, the fungus is also affected, and no\r\ndoubt this is the principal reason why Rust-fungi, for instance, vary so\r\nmuch in their vigour and reproductive power on different wheats and\r\ngrasses, though the other factors of the environment must also be of\r\ninfluence on them as well as on the hosts.\r\n\r\nBut--and this is the second point--modern research is also showing that\r\nthe various species of Rust-fungi have split up into different varieties\r\nor specialised races, according to the particular host plants they\r\ninhabit. For instance there are special varieties or races of the\r\nparticular species known as _Puccinia graminis_, the wheat rust, each of\r\nwhich grows well on various kinds of grain and grasses but refuses to\r\ninfect others. Thus, the variety which infects Wheat refuses to infect\r\nBarley or Oats, while that variety which grows on Rye will not take on\r\nWheat and so forth. Now it is important to notice that these specialised\r\nraces are indistinguishable one from another by their visible\r\nmicroscopic characters: they are all botanically of the species\r\n_Puccinia graminis_ which forms its aecida on the Barberry. We must\r\ntherefore conclude that we have here the same phenomenon as that met\r\nwith in culture-races of bacteria which, having been fed for several\r\ngenerations on media rich in proteids, refuse to grow on media rich in\r\ncarbohydrates, or when attenuated races are developed by culture under\r\nspecial conditions.\r\n\r\nNow since such physiological races as I have described are by no means\r\nconfined to _Puccinia_ but are also known in _Melampsora_,\r\n_Gymnosporangium_ and other fungi, we must conclude from this and from\r\nwhat we know of variation in plants and animals generally, that\r\nvariation and adaptation are common among parasites, insects as well as\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\nThese considerations will serve to show moreover that the question of\r\nbreeding disease-proof varieties of our cultivated plants is complicated\r\nby the danger of our breeding at the same time adapted races of their\r\npests. It appears at first sight extremely improbable that we should\r\nescape the danger by breeding from those specimens of our plants which\r\nhave best survived a fungus epidemic. Still, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat \"hardy varieties,\" and races adapted to other exigencies of the\r\nnon-living environment, have been bred by selection--and nevertheless\r\nthis variable non-living environment is always with us. The matter is\r\ntherefore simply and solely one of experiment, and the retort that a\r\ndisease-resisting variety of any particular plant has not yet been\r\nraised is no more valid than the objection that a true blue primrose has\r\nnot yet been obtained: whether the same remark can be made with regard\r\nto any hope of a _disease-proof_ plant may be another matter, but in any\r\ncase it must be made more cautiously in the light of our present\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n     The reader will find more on this subject in Bailey's\r\n     _Survival of the Unlike_ and the literature quoted in the\r\n     notes to Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\n     For varieties of Indian Wheats, etc., see Watt, _Agricultural\r\n     Ledger_, Calcutta, 1895.\r\n\r\n     For a discussion on so-called \"Disease-proof Wheats\" consult\r\n     Eriksson & Henning, _Die Getreideroste_.\r\n\r\n     Magnus' paper is in the _Berichte der Deutschen bot.\r\n     Gesellsch._, 1894, p. 39.\r\n\r\n     Concerning physiological races and adapted varieties of\r\n     _Puccinia_, etc., see Eriksson, \"A General View of the\r\n     Principal Results of Swedish Research into Grain Rust,\"\r\n     _Botanical Gazette_, vol. 25, 1898, p. 26.\r\n\r\n     For an account of Wheat-rust see Marshall Ward, \"Illustrations\r\n     of the Structure and Life-history of _Puccinia graminis_,\r\n     etc.,\" _Ann. of Bot._, 1888, Vol. II., p. 215.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\n     _Discolorations--Pallor--Etiolation--Laying of Wheat--\r\n     Chlorosis--Yellowing--Albinism--Variegation--Uprooting,\r\n     Exposure and Wilting of seedlings._\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody knows in a general way when the geraniums in the window pots\r\nare drooping from want of water, or when the young Wheat is sickly, or\r\nthe Pear-trees \"blighted,\" and we have now to see how far we can\r\nsystematise the knowledge that has been gained in course of time\r\nregarding the signs which sick plants exhibit.\r\n\r\n_Pallor._--Under this heading, which includes all cases where the normal\r\nhealthy green colour is replaced by a general sickly yellow or pale hue,\r\nultimately resulting in death of the parts if not arrested, we have\r\nseveral totally distinct diseases of the chlorophyll apparatus, each\r\nrecognised by the co-existence of other subordinate symptoms. The\r\nprincipal varieties of pallor usually met with are the following:\r\n\r\n_Etiolation_ is due to insufficient intensity of light, the pale sickly\r\nyellow organs being unusually watery and deficient in vascular tissue,\r\nthe internodes abnormally long and thin, and the leaves generally\r\nreduced in size, or, in some plants also \"drawn.\"\r\n\r\nForced Endive, Rhubarb, Asparagus, and earthed Celery afford examples of\r\netiolation purposely induced. The want of light causes the true\r\nchlorophyll colouring matter to remain in abeyance, and consequently the\r\nplant as a whole suffers from carbohydrate starvation.\r\n\r\n_Laying_ of Wheat and other cereals is a particular case of etiolation.\r\nThe seeds having been sown too thickly, the bases of the haulms, owing\r\nto the etiolation and consequent lack of carbohydrates, suffer from want\r\nof stiffening tissues, and the top-heavy plants fall over.\r\n\r\n_False etiolation_ depends on a similar abeyance of the chlorophyll, but\r\nin this case due to too low a temperature. It is often seen in Wheat and\r\nother monocotyledons when the young leaves unfold in cold weather in\r\nspring. The symptoms of \"drawing\" and tenderness are however absent.\r\n\r\nPallor due to too intense illumination must be kept sharply distinct\r\nfrom etiolation, the pale green or yellow hue being here due to the\r\ndestruction of the chlorophyll by insolation, and the accessory symptoms\r\nof \"drawing\" are wanting.\r\n\r\n_Chlorosis_ is a form of pallor where the chlorophyll grains themselves\r\nare fully developed, but their green pigment remains in abeyance owing\r\nto a deficiency of iron in the soil, and can often be cured by adding\r\ntraces of a ferrous salt. The distinction between _Icterus_, where the\r\norgans are only yellow, and _Chlorosis_ proper, where they are nearly\r\nwhite cannot always be maintained. In the typical case only those organs\r\nwhose cells are still young can become green on adding iron.\r\n\r\n_Yellowing_ or _False Chlorosis_ may be experimentally induced by too\r\nmuch carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere. It also often ensues when the\r\nroots of plants in the open are waterlogged, owing to the stagnant water\r\nnot only driving air from the root-hairs but accumulating dissolved\r\nsubstances which poison the plant. Trees frequently thus suffer from\r\n\"wet feet\" when their roots have penetrated down to a sodden impervious\r\nsubsoil.\r\n\r\n_Yellowing_ accompanied by _Wilting_ is a predominant symptom in most\r\ncases where transpiration is more active than root-absorption beyond a\r\ncertain limit, as is well known in cases of prolonged drought. It may\r\nalso be caused in evergreens by the foliage transpiring actively in\r\nbright January weather, for instance, while the ground is frozen and the\r\nchilled root-hairs cannot absorb.\r\n\r\nIn other cases similar appearances are traceable to insects devouring\r\nthe roots, _e.g._ wireworms, and the malady is sometimes enhanced by\r\ntheir accumulations so fouling the wet soil that the roots die off,\r\nowing to want of oxygen and to the excess of carbon-dioxide and\r\npoisonous matters.\r\n\r\nYellowing may also result from the presence of poisonous or acid gases\r\nin the atmosphere or soil, such as chlorine, hydrochloric acid,\r\nsulphurous acid, etc., in the neighbourhood of chemical works, or from\r\nthe escape of coal-gas in streets, etc., points of importance in\r\nconnection with the use of fungicides and insecticides.\r\n\r\nYellowness is the prevailing symptom in many cases of fungus attack of\r\nthe roots or collar of the plant, the resulting stoppage of\r\ntranspiration being also sometimes supplemented by rotting of the roots,\r\nand the consequent deprival of oxygen and accumulation of foul gases. In\r\nother cases Fungi, and even Bacteria, have been found to have made their\r\nway into the principal vessels, the lumina of which they stop up, thus\r\nreducing the transpiration current.\r\n\r\nCertain insects may also induce a general yellowing and wilting of\r\nplants by entering or destroying the tissues concerned in the\r\ntranspiration--_e.g._ _Oniscus_, the Frit Fly, and _Cecidomya_, the\r\nHessian Fly, which attack young winter wheat within the sheaths and\r\ncause the plants to turn yellow and wilt.\r\n\r\n_Albinism_ and _Variegation_ are apparently due to causes totally\r\ndifferent from any yet mentioned. Church's analyses have shown that\r\nalbino leaves contain more water and less organic matter than green ones\r\nof the same plants, but not necessarily less ash constituents. The\r\ncomposition of the ash points to there being more potash and less lime\r\nin the white organs than in the green ones, and, speaking generally, the\r\nformer are related to the latter much as young leaves are related to\r\nmature ones.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter is complicated by the behaviour of certain _variegated_\r\nplants--_e.g._ Ribbon grass, _Calla_, _Abutilon_, which are usually\r\nregarded as partial albinos.\r\n\r\nMeyen showed long ago that such variegated plants, if grafted on green\r\nones, may induce the development of variegated leaves on both scion and\r\nstock, and Morren and others have not only confirmed this but have also\r\nshown that variegation may be inherited through the seed. Nevertheless\r\nsome care has to be taken with many of these variegations lest rich\r\nsoil, bright light, and other favourable treatment favour the\r\nrestitution of the green colour. These facts may be interpreted in\r\nvarious ways. Some disturbance of physiological functions of the roots,\r\ndue to unfavourable conditions of soil, may be the cause; but Beijerinck\r\nhas lately published some results which show that some of these albino\r\ndiseases can be induced by inoculating normal plants with the juice of\r\nspotted ones even though such juice has been filtered through porcelain,\r\nand concludes that a \"_contagium fluidum vivum_\" of the nature of a\r\ntransmissible enzyme is the agent which disturbs the physiology of the\r\ninfected cells.\r\n\r\nKoning, while confirming these results in the main, refers them to a\r\nmicro-organism so small that it traverses the porcelain filter.\r\n\r\n_Upheaval of seedlings._--This is a common form of injury, resulting in\r\ndeath by drought and exposure, especially in seedling pines, wheat,\r\netc., in soils exposed to alternate freezing and thawing during spring\r\nwhen there is no snow to protect the plants. The soil freezes during the\r\nnight, and during the thaw next day water accumulates just below the\r\nsurface. The freezing is then repeated, and, partly owing to the\r\nexpansion of the forming ice and partly to the mechanical effect of the\r\nice-crystals in the interstices, the surface of the soil is lifted and\r\ndraws the roots with it. During the succeeding thaw the soil particles\r\nfall away from the lifted root-fibres, and frequent repetition of these\r\nprocesses results in such complete exposure of the roots to the full sun\r\nthat the plantlet falls over and wilts.\r\n\r\n_Exposure of roots_ is also sometimes effected by winds displacing sandy\r\nsoils liable to shifting in dry weather, and the resulting wilting of\r\nthe plants thus exposed at their roots may be supplemented by damage due\r\nto the repeated impact of the wind-driven sharp grains of sand, which\r\nact like a sand-blast and erode the tissues.\r\n\r\nIn many of the cases given above the principal result is the weakening\r\nor destruction of the chlorophyll action. This means a loss of\r\ncarbohydrates--sugars, starches, etc.--and in so far a starvation of the\r\nplant. The injurious effects are quantitative and cumulative: if large\r\nareas of foliage are concerned, or if the effect lasts a long time, the\r\nplant suffers from loss of food, and may die. In those cases where the\r\neffect is due to the cutting off of supplies at the roots, and where the\r\nyellowing is a secondary symptom, the disease is more general in\r\ncharacter, and recovery is often impossible, because the loss of water\r\ncannot be compensated, and the results may be further complicated by the\r\ngradual penetration of poisonous matter into the cells. It is frequently\r\nnecessary, though sometimes very difficult, to decide which is the\r\nprimary and which secondary (or tertiary, etc.) symptoms in the order of\r\ntheir importance, and the diagnosis may be complicated by a number of\r\naccessory factors which it is impossible to treat generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n     The principal cases here described are dealt with in works on\r\n     plant physiology, and in the works of Sorauer and Frank\r\n     already referred to.\r\n\r\n     As regards damage due to uprooting of seedlings by frost, see\r\n     Fisher, \"Forest Protection\" (Engl. ed. of Hess' _Forstchutz_),\r\n     in Schlich's _Manual of Forestry_, Vol. IV., 1895, pp.\r\n     439-442.\r\n\r\n     On Albinism, see Church, \"A Chemical Study of Vegetable\r\n     Albinism,\" _Journ. Chem. Soc._, 1879, 1880, 1886.\r\n\r\n     Beijerinck's results are contained in his paper, \"Ueber ein\r\n     Contagium vivum fluidum,\" etc. (with English abstract), in\r\n     _Verhandl. d. Kon. Akad. v. Wetensch, te Amsterdam_, 1898.\r\n     Koning's paper is in _Zeitschr. f. Pflanzenkrank._, Vol. IX.,\r\n     1899, p. 65. See also _Nature_, Oct. 11, 1900, p. 576.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF DISEASE (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n     _Spotted leaves--The colours of spots--White, yellow, brown,\r\n     and black spots on leaves--Parti-coloured spots--The browning,\r\n     etc., of leaves._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Discoloured spots_ or patches on the herbaceous parts of plants,\r\nespecially leaves, furnish the prominent symptoms in a large class of\r\ndiseases, due to many different causes, and although we cannot maintain\r\nthis group of symptoms sharply apart from the last, as seen from the\r\nconsiderations on _albinism_, it is often well marked and of great\r\ndiagnostic value. By far the greater number of spot-diseases are due to\r\nfungi, but this is by no means always the case. The most generally\r\nuseful method of subdividing the classes, though artificial like all\r\nsuch classifications, will be according to the colour of the spots or\r\nflecks, which, moreover, are usually found on the leaves. It is\r\nnecessary to note, however, that various conditions may modify the\r\ncolour of spots on leaves. Many fungi, for instance, induce different\r\ncoloured spots according to the age of the leaf or other organ attacked,\r\nor according to the species of host, the weather, etc. Moreover the\r\nspots due to these parasites are frequently yellow when young and some\r\nother colour, especially brown or black, when older.\r\n\r\n_Scale_ is the name given to the characteristic shield-like insects\r\n(_Mytilaspis_, _Aspidiotus_, etc.) which attach themselves to branches\r\nof Apples, Pears, Oranges, Camellias, and numerous other plants, and\r\nsuck the juices. It is the female insect which has the body broadened\r\nout into the \"scale,\" under which the young are brought up. Enormous\r\ndamage has been done by some forms--_e.g._ the San Jose scale in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe superficial resemblances of the patches of eggs of some Lepidoptera\r\nto Aecidia and other fungi may be noted in passing--_e.g._ _Bombyx\r\nneustria_ on Apple twigs, _Aporia Crataegi_.\r\n\r\n_White_ or _greyish spots_ are the common symptom marking the presence\r\nof many Peronosporeae and Erysipheae in or on leaves, _e.g._\r\n_Peronospora Trifoliorum_, _P. parasitica_ on Crucifers, etc., and\r\n_Sphaerotheca_ on Hops; also _Septoria piricola_, _Cystopus_, _Entyloma\r\nRanunculi_, etc.\r\n\r\nWhite spots are also caused by insects such as _Tetranychus_ (red\r\nspider) on Clover and other plants.\r\n\r\n_Yellow_, or _Orange-coloured Spots_. In cases where these occur on\r\nleaves, and in the case of grasses, etc., on the leaf sheaths as well,\r\nthey commonly indicate the presence of Uredineae, and sections under\r\nthe microscope will show the mycelium in the tissues beneath. Species of\r\n_Uromyces_, _Puccinia_, etc., in the Uredo state have the spots powdery\r\nwith spores; _Aecidia_ show the characteristic \"cluster cups,\" and so\r\nforth. These spots are often slightly pustular, and in some cases\r\nmarkedly so.\r\n\r\nOther fungi also induce yellow spots on leaves--_e.g._ _Phyllosticta_ on\r\nBeans, _Exoascus_ on Poplars, _Clasterosporium_ on Apricot leaves,\r\n_Synchytrium Succisae_ on _Centaurea_, etc.\r\n\r\nYellow spots are also a frequent symptom of the presence of Aphides, of\r\nRed Spider, etc. Thus the minute golden yellow spots sometimes crowded\r\non Oak leaves are due to _Phylloxera_ punctures.\r\n\r\nYellow patches are formed on the large leaves of _Arisarum_ by a species\r\nof parasitic Alga, _Phyllosiphon_, which lives in the mesophyll. Many\r\ntropical leaves are spotted yellow by epiphytic Algae--_e.g._\r\n_Cephaleuros_.\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed that many fungi produce yellow spots or flecks in the\r\nearlier stages, which turn brown or black as the fructifications appear,\r\n_e.g._ _Dilophia graminis_, _Rhytisma acerinum_.\r\n\r\nThe yellow-spotted leaves of _Farfugium grande_ (_Senecio Kaempferi_)\r\nare so like those of _Petasites_ attacked with _Aecidium_ in its early\r\nstages, that an expert might be deceived until the microscopic analysis\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\n_Red spots_, varying from rusty or foxy red to bright crimson, are the\r\nsymptomatic accompaniment of several fungi, the former often\r\ncharacterising the teleutospore or aecidium stage of Uredineae--_e.g._\r\n_Aecidium Grossulariae_--the latter sometimes indicating the presence of\r\nChytridiaceae.\r\n\r\nRed spots are also caused by _Gloeosporium Fragariae_ on Strawberry\r\nleaves, _Polystigma rubrum_ on Plums.\r\n\r\nCrimson spots on Apple and Pear leaves are also due to _Phytoptus_: they\r\nturn brown later.\r\n\r\n_Brown spots_ or flecks, varying in hue from dull slaty brown to deep\r\nred browns, are a common symptom of Fungus and Insect diseases, the\r\ncolour often indicating the death of the tissues, rather than any\r\nspecial peculiarity of the action of the parasite. Good examples are\r\nfurnished by the Potato-disease, and by _Peronospora viticola_,\r\n_Sphaerella vitis_ and other disease-fungi of the Grape Vine. The\r\nteleutospore stage of many Uredineae also occurs in deep brown spots.\r\n\r\nBlack spots and flecks are exceedingly common symptoms of the presence\r\nof fungi, _e.g._ _Fusicladium_ on Apples and Pears, and the pycnidial\r\nand ascus stages of many Ascomycetes--_e.g._ _Phyllachora graminis_. The\r\nteleutospore stages of species of _Puccinia_, _Phragmidium_, etc., are\r\nalso so deep in colour as to appear almost black.\r\n\r\n_Scab_ on Pears is due to the presence of _Fusicladium_, which indurates\r\nthe outer skin of the fruit causing it to crack under pressure from\r\nwithin, and to dry up, the deep brown to black patches of fungus\r\npersisting on the dead surface.\r\n\r\nBlack spots on grasses and sedges are caused by Ustilagineae, and are\r\ncommonest in the grain, the soot-like powdery spores (Smut) being very\r\ncharacteristic. _Ustilago longissima_ induces black streaks on the\r\nleaves. Many of these fungi cause distortions or pustules on leaves and\r\nother organs.\r\n\r\nBrown and black leaf spots are frequently furnished with concentric\r\ncontours arranged round a paler or other coloured central point--_e.g._\r\n_Cercospora_ on Beans, _Ascochyta_ on Peas.\r\n\r\nBrown spots with bright red margins are formed in young Beans by\r\n_Gloeosporium_.\r\n\r\nSpecies of _Fumago_, _Herpotrichia_, etc., may cover the entire surface\r\nof the leaf with sooty patches, or even weave the leaves together as if\r\nwith black spider-webs.\r\n\r\n_Mal nero_ of the Vine is a particular case of black spotting and\r\nstreaking of the leaves for which no satisfactory explanation is as yet\r\nto hand. As with Chestnuts, Walnuts, and other plants containing much\r\ntannin, the dark spots appear to be due to this substance, but whether\r\nthe predisposing cause is a lack of some ingredients in the soil, or\r\nsome temperature reaction, or fungi at the roots, is as yet unknown. The\r\nmost recent explanation puts the disease down to the action of bacteria,\r\nbut the results obtained by different workers lead to uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe \"dying back\" of leaves, especially of grasses, from the tip, is\r\nusually accompanied by a succession of colours--yellow, red, brown, to\r\nblack--and is a common symptom of parching from summer drought; and\r\nspots of similar colours, frequently commencing at the margins of\r\nleaves, are characteristic symptoms of the injurious action of acid\r\ngases in the air.\r\n\r\nBrown and blackish spots on Pears are caused by a species of _Thrips_.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the minute spots of Rust-fungi on one and the same leaf\r\nare bright orange yellow (_uredo_), deep brown, or almost purple-black\r\n(_teleutospores_), foxy-red brown (older uredospores), or dead slaty\r\nblack where the old teleutospores have died off--_e.g._ _Uromyces Fabae_\r\non Beans, _U. Pisi_ on Peas, etc.\r\n\r\n_Parti-coloured leaves._--The leaves sometimes start shrivelling with\r\nred edges, while yellow, red, and finally brown and black blotches\r\nappear on the lamina, from no known cause--_e.g._ Vines. In other cases\r\nsimilar mimicry of the autumnal colouring of leaves results from the\r\naction of acid gases.\r\n\r\n_Burning_ is a common name for all cases where the leaves turn red or\r\nred-brown in hot, dry weather, and many varieties are distinguished in\r\ndifferent countries and on different plants, because species react\r\ndissimilarly. The primary cause is usually want of water--drought.\r\n\r\n_Foxy leaves_ are a common sign of drought on hot soils, and the disease\r\nmay usually be recognised by the gradual extension of the drying and\r\nfox-red colour proceeding from the older to the younger leaves, and from\r\nbase to apex--_e.g._ Hops.\r\n\r\n_Coppery leaves._--The leaves of the Hop, etc., may show yellow spots\r\nand gradually turn red-brown--copper-coloured--as they dry; the damage\r\nis due to _Tetranychus_, the so-called Red Spider. These cases must of\r\ncourse be carefully distinguished from the normal copper-brown of\r\ncertain varieties of Beech, Beet, _Coleus_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Silver-leaf._--The leaves of Plum, Apple, and other fruit trees often\r\nobtain a peculiar silvery appearance in hot summers, the cause of which\r\nis unknown.\r\n\r\nDiscolorations in the form of confluent yellow and orange patches, etc.,\r\nresembling variegations, are not infrequently due to the ravages of Red\r\nSpider and mites--_e.g._ on Kidney Beans.\r\n\r\n_Sun-spots._--Yellow spots, which may turn brown or black according to\r\nthe species of plant affected and the intensity of the action, are often\r\ncaused by the focussing of the solar rays by lens-like thickenings due\r\nto inequalities in the glass of greenhouses, or by drops of water on\r\nthem or on other leaves, _e.g._ Palms, _Dracaena_, etc. The action is\r\nthat of a burning glass, and extends throughout the leaf-tissues. Young\r\ngrapes, etc., may also be injured in this way. Water-drops on the glass\r\ncan only act long enough to produce such injuries if the atmosphere is\r\nsaturated. The old idea that a drop on a leaf can thus focus the sun's\r\nrays into the tissues beneath is not tenable.\r\n\r\nHere again we see that the disease-agencies concerned in producing the\r\nsymptoms described in this chapter, agree for the most part in so far\r\nthat the principal effect is generally the disturbance of chlorophyll\r\naction in the spots or flecks on the leaves, and the rendering useless\r\nof these areas so far as providing further food-supplies is concerned.\r\nThe effects may be due merely to the shading action of a\r\nparasite--_e.g._ epiphytic fungi--or to actual destruction of the\r\ntissues invaded--_e.g._ by endophytic fungi--or the tissues may be\r\nburnt, poisoned, etc. In so far the results are again quantitative and\r\ncumulative, and the amount of damage depends on the number and size of\r\nthe spots or other areas affected, and the proportion of foliage\r\ninvolved, as well as the length of time the injurious action is at work.\r\nBut, again, it must be remembered that several symptoms may co-exist,\r\nand matters may be complicated by the spread of the destructive agent,\r\nor its consequences, to other parts, and in some cases we are quite\r\nuninformed as to the true nature of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n     Further information regarding these \"leaf-diseases\" will be\r\n     found in special works dealing with the fungi and insects\r\n     which cause them.

This is found to occur in all cell-tissues provided the cells\r\nare still living, and it matters not whether the wound occurs in the\r\nmesophyll of a leaf, the storage parenchyma of a Potato-tuber, the\r\ncortex of a root or stem, or in the fleshy parts of a young fruit, the\r\nnormal effect of the wound is in all cases to call forth an elongation\r\nof the uninjured cells beneath, in a direction at right angles to the\r\nplane of the injured surface, which cells then divide by successive\r\nwalls across their axis of growth: the layers of cells thus cut off are\r\nthen converted into cork, by the suberisation of their walls. Further\r\nchanges may then go on beneath the protective layer of wound-cork thus\r\nproduced, and these changes vary according to the nature of the cells\r\nbeneath: the cambium forms new wood, the medullary rays similar rays,\r\ncortex new cortex, and so on.\r\n\r\n_Knife-wounds._--Artificial cuts in stems are easily recognised and soon\r\nheal up unless disturbed. Several cases, differing in complexity, are to\r\nbe distinguished. The simplest is that of a longitudinal, oblique, or\r\nhorizontal short cut in which the point of the knife severs all the\r\ntissues of the stem down to the wood. The first effect usually observed\r\nis that the wound gapes, especially if longitudinal, because the cortex,\r\ntightly stretched on the wood cylinder, contracts elastically. This\r\nexposes the living cortex, phloem and cambium to the air, and such\r\ntissues at once behave as already described above: the cells actually\r\ncut die, those next below grow out under the released pressure, and\r\nthese give rise to cells which become cork. As the growth and\r\ncell-division continue in the cells below this thin elastic cork-layer,\r\nthey form a soft herbaceous cushion or _callus_ looking like a thickened\r\nlip to each margin of the cut. Each lip soon meets its opposite\r\nneighbour, and the wound is closed over, a slight projection with a\r\nmedian axial depression alone appearing on the surface. The depression\r\ncontains the trapped-in callus-cork squeezed more and more in the plane\r\nof the cut as the two lips of callus press one against the other, and\r\nsections across the stem and perpendicular to the axis of the cut show\r\nthat this thin cork, like a bit of brown paper, alone intervenes between\r\nthe cambium, phloem and cortex respectively of each lip, as each layer\r\nattempts to bridge over the interval. If the healing proceeds normally,\r\nthese layers, each pressing against the trapped cork-film, and growing\r\nmore and more in thickness, shear the cork-layer and tear its cells\r\nasunder, and very soon we find odd cells of the cambium of one lip\r\nmeeting cambium cells of the other, phloem meeting phloem, and cortex\r\ncortex, and the normal thickening of the now fused layers previously\r\nseparated by the knife goes on as if nothing had happened, the only\r\nexternal sign of the wound being a slight ridge-like elevation, and,\r\ninternally, traces of the dead cells and cork trapped here and there\r\nbeneath the ridge. When the conjoined cambium resumes the development\r\nof a continuous layer of xylem and phloem, no further trace of the\r\ninjury is observable, unless a speck of dead cells remains buried\r\nbeneath the new wood, and indicates the line where the knife point\r\nkilled the former cambium and scored the surface of the wood in making\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\n_Stripping._--Now suppose that, instead of a mere slit with the\r\nknife-point, a strip of bark is removed down to the wood. Exactly the\r\nsame processes of corking and lip-like callus formation at the edges of\r\nthe wound occur, but of course the occlusion of the bared wood-surface\r\nby the meeting of the lips occupies a longer time. Moreover, the living\r\ncells of the medullary rays exposed by the wound on the wood-surface\r\nalso grow out under the released pressure, and form protruding callus\r\npads on their own account. In course of time the wood is again\r\ncompletely covered by the coming together over its face of these various\r\nstrips of callus, but two important points of difference are found, as\r\ncontrasted with the simpler healing of the slit-wound. In the first\r\nplace the exposed wood dries and turns brown, or it may even begin to\r\ndecay if moisture and putrefactive organisms act on it while exposed to\r\nthe air; and, in the second place, the normal annual layer of wood--or\r\nlayers, as the case may be--formed by the cambium only extends over that\r\npart of the stem where the cambium is still intact, and is entirely\r\nwanting over the exposed area. Thus, if it takes two years for the\r\ncambium to extend across the wound, a layer of wood will be formed all\r\nround the intact part of the stem, from lip to lip of the cut tissues\r\nduring the first year; then a second annual layer outside this will be\r\nformed during the second year, but extending further over the edges of\r\nthe wound, and nearly complete, because the cambium has now crept\r\nfurther across the wounded surface to meet the opposite lip of cambium;\r\nand during the third year, when the cambium has once more become\r\ncontinuous over the face of the wound, the annual wood layer will be\r\ncomplete. But, of course, this last layer covers in the edges of the two\r\npreviously developed incomplete wood-layers as well as the exposed and\r\nbrown, dry, or rotten dead face of the wood. It also covers up the\r\ntrapped-in brown cork and any debris that accumulated in the wound, and\r\nthis \"blemish,\" though buried deeper and deeper in the wood during\r\nsucceeding annual deposits of wood-layers, always remains to remind us\r\nof the existence of the wound, the date of which can be fixed at any\r\nfuture time by counting the annual rings developed subsequently to its\r\nformation. Obviously, also, the deficiency of wood at this place makes\r\nitself visible on the outside by a depression.\r\n\r\n_Cuttings._--When a cutting of _Pelargonium_, Willow, or other plant is\r\nmade, we have a typical knife-wound, the behaviour of which is very\r\ninstructive in illustration of plant-surgery, and may be most easily\r\nseen by keeping it in damp air instead of plunging it into sand or\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nAll the living cells actually cut or bruised turn brown and die as\r\nbefore; those beneath--_e.g._ the living pith, medullary rays, cambium,\r\nphloem, and cortex, grow out under the released pressure and form a\r\ncallus, the outermost layer of which becomes cork, while those below,\r\nabundantly supplied with food-materials, proceed to spread, as if\r\nflowing over the surface of the cut wood, and rapidly occlude the wound.\r\nMeanwhile new roots are formed adventitiously from the cambium just\r\nabove the plane of section, and push out through the cortex into the\r\ndamp air, and if the cutting had been in soil it would now be capable of\r\nindependent existence. It is important to keep cuttings upright, as the\r\nroots only spring from the lower end. Such cuttings can be obtained not\r\nonly from stems, but also from roots and even leaves.\r\n\r\nCallus-formation is not confined to the basal end of a cutting; it has\r\nnothing to do with position, but is a reaction to the wound stimuli,\r\nindependent of light, gravitation, etc. As time goes on, however, the\r\ninternal organisation of the erect cutting usually reacts on the callus\r\nat either end, and roots only rise from the lower one, while shoot-buds\r\nmay form in the upper one, though it is possible to bring about the\r\nformation of buds from the lower end also.\r\n\r\n_Branch stumps._--A more complex example is furnished by a branch cut\r\noff short some distance--say a foot--from the base, where it springs\r\nfrom the trunk. As before, the immediate effect of the section is the\r\nformation of a callus from the cambium, phloem and cortex, which begins\r\nto rise as a circular occluding rim round the wood. The transpiration\r\ncurrent in the trunk, however, is not deflected into the 12 inches or so\r\nof amputated branch, because there are no leaves to draw the water up\r\nit, and so the stump dries up and the cortex and cambium die back to the\r\nbase, leaving the dead wood covered with shrivelled cortical tissues\r\nonly. This dead stump gradually rots under the action of wet, fungi, and\r\nbacteria, and since the pith and heart-wood afford a ready passage of\r\nthe rot-organisms and their products into the heart of the trunk, we\r\nfind in a few years a mere stump of touch-wood and decayed bark, which\r\nfalls out at the insertion like a decayed tooth, leaving a rotten hole\r\nin the side of the trunk.\r\n\r\nIf, however, instead of allowing the basal part of the amputated branch\r\nto protrude as a stump, we cut it off close to the stem, and shave the\r\nsection flush with the normal surface of the latter, the callus formed\r\nby the cambium, etc., rapidly grows over the surface, and soon forms a\r\nlayer of cambium continuous with that of the rest of the stem. The wound\r\nheals, in fact, much as if it were a strip-wound, and beyond a slight\r\nprominence for a year or two no signs are visible from the outside after\r\nthe occlusion. Of course these matters depend on the relative thickness\r\nof branch and stem, and if much wood is exposed the dangers of rot and a\r\nresulting hollow in the stem are increased. It is interesting to note\r\nhow much thicker the callus lips are at the sides of the wound than\r\nabove and below, owing to differences in the distribution of the\r\nnutrient materials.\r\n\r\n_Stool-stumps._--When a tree is felled, the stump may, if the section is\r\nclose to the ground and kept moist, begin to form a thick rim-like\r\ncallus round the wood, in which adventitious buds soon make their\r\nappearance, and grow out into so-called _Stool-shoots_. The products of\r\nassimilation of these, and the stores accumulated in the stump, often\r\nsuffice to feed the callus sufficiently to enable it to grow over and\r\ncompletely occlude the wound, if the wood surface is not too large, or\r\nso long exposed that rotting processes have meanwhile set in.\r\n\r\n_Ringing._--If the strip of cortical tissues and cambium is removed all\r\nround the stem, exposing the wood in a form of a ring, complications may\r\nensue owing to the following circumstances. A well-marked callus appears\r\nat the upper edge of the wound, because, the transpiration current up\r\nthe young wood not being stopped, plenty of water and salts from the\r\nsoil can reach the leaves; but the nutritive materials supplied by the\r\nlatter are accumulated at the upper lip of the wound owing to the\r\nstoppage there of their descent in the phloem, cortex, etc. No such\r\ncallus-lip appears at the lower margin of the wound owing to want of\r\nthese supplies. Consequently the occlusion and healing of the ring-wound\r\nonly takes place from above downwards, and if the ring of cortical\r\ntissues removed is a broad one, the healing may be a long process, or\r\nmay even be indefinitely delayed, a thicker and thicker callus\r\nprojecting over from above. For similar reasons no annual wood layers\r\nare formed below, but only above the wound, and thus the branch or tree\r\nmay die. The latter contingency is the more likely the further up the\r\ntree the ringing takes place, owing to the risk of drying up which\r\nthreatens the exposed wood, and to the consequent interruption of the\r\ntranspiration current, and the likelihood that lateral shoots below the\r\nwound may divert the water to their own leaves. If the ringing occurs\r\nlow down on a stem, and the environment remains damp, the upper thick\r\ncallus may put out new roots; the part above the wound then behaves like\r\na cutting. If the ringing is done on a young and vigorous branch of an\r\nold tree, the lower lip may receive supplies from the leaves of branches\r\nbelow the wound, or from shoots which spring from adventitious buds\r\nclose to it, and the wound may heal over normally. Such healing may be\r\nrendered more certain by keeping the wounded surface moist--_e.g._ by\r\nmeans of damp moss, and so encouraging the formation of callus-bridges\r\nfrom the medullary rays.\r\n\r\nIf on ringing a tree or a branch the young wood is removed as well as\r\nthe cambium and cortical layers, the death of the parts above the wound\r\nis almost certain, owing to the stoppage of the transpiration current:\r\nthe exceptions to this rule depend simply on the existence of other\r\nchannels of communication, such as internal phloems, very thick\r\nsap-wood, and so forth.\r\n\r\n_Bruises._--If a branch or woody stem is struck sharply, with a hammer,\r\nfor instance, the bruised cortex, phloem and cambium are killed by the\r\nblow, and the general effect is as if these tissues had been removed at\r\nthat spot by the knife, but with the following complications. The\r\nbruised cortical tissues rapidly dry as they perish, and may adhere to\r\nthe wood below. Consequently the still sound parts bordering on the\r\nwound are not released from pressure, but, on the contrary, have to\r\nadvance towards each other over the surface of the wood under still\r\ngreater pressures, in part due to the tightening of the whole cortex as\r\nthe dead parts dry and contract, and in part due to the above-mentioned\r\nadherence of the latter to the wood. It results from this that such\r\nwounds heal very slowly and badly, and when the killed patch at last\r\nruptures, wound-fungi, insects, and other injurious agencies may get in\r\nand do irreparable damage, as has been found to occur in cases where\r\nsuch wounds have been made in striking trees to shake down insects,\r\nfruit, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n     The essential facts regarding wounds and healing by occlusion\r\n     are given in Marshall Ward, _Timber and some of its Diseases_,\r\n     1889, chapters viii. and ix., and in Laslett, _Timber and\r\n     Timber Trees_, 1894, chapters iv. and v.

Bark-boring--Wood-boring--Wood\r\n     fungi--Leaf-miners--Pith flecks--Erosions. Skeleton leaves--\r\n     Irregular erosions--Shot holes. Frost cracks--Strangulations--\r\n     Spiral grooving._\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural wounds are produced in a variety of ways during the life of the\r\nplant, and, generally speaking, are easily healed over by the normal\r\nprocess if the area destroyed is not too large, and the parts remaining\r\nuninjured are sufficiently provided with foliage, or with supplies of\r\nfood-materials stored up in the roots, rhizomes, medullary rays, etc.,\r\nto feed a vigorous callus.\r\n\r\nThe nature of such wounds and the mode of healing are explained by what\r\nwe know of artificial wounds, and it only remains to point out that the\r\nprincipal danger of ordinary wounds is not so much the direct traumatic\r\naction, because the simpler organisation of the plant does not involve\r\nmatters connected with shock, loss of blood, etc., as in animals; the\r\ndanger consists, rather, in their affording access to other injurious\r\nagents, especially fungi, and the treatment of wounds frequently\r\nresolves itself into cutting or pruning in order to get clean surfaces\r\nwhich can heal readily.\r\n\r\nWounds on leaves imply loss of foliar surface--_i.e._ of chlorophyll\r\naction--and the remarks on page 193 apply.\r\n\r\n_Burrows_ may be taken as comprising all kinds of tunnel-like\r\nexcavations in the various organs of plants, including those cases where\r\ninsects burrow into hollow stems of grasses, etc., as indicated by the\r\nperforations they make in the outer tissues.\r\n\r\n_Bark-boring_ is done by many species of beetles, especially\r\n_Scolytidae_, which excavate characteristically formed branching\r\npassages tangentially in the inner bark of Conifers and other trees.\r\nSome of them also bore down to the surface of the sap wood (_e.g._\r\n_Tomicus bidentatus_) or even burrow right into the latter (_e.g._ _T.\r\nlineatum_). It commonly happens that the external apertures show up\r\nclearly, owing to the brown dust and excrement, sometimes accompanied by\r\nturpentine, which exude from them. Many of these Bark beetles only\r\nattack trees which are already injured by fire, lightning, etc.;\r\npossibly they cannot bore through a cortex which swamps them with sap,\r\nas a vigorous one might do.\r\n\r\n_Wood-boring_ is also done by many of the bark-beetles as well as by\r\nLongicorns, _e.g._ _Saperda_ in Poplars and Willows, the young shoots\r\nof which often show characteristic swellings with lateral holes\r\nindicating the points of exit. From the external apertures comminuted\r\nwood, like saw-dust, is frequently ejected in quantity and betrays the\r\npresence of the insects. Certain wood-wasps (_Sirex_) and the larvae of\r\nmoths (_Cossus_) also make large perforations in the wood of Willows and\r\nother trees, often destroying it completely. In the case of these larger\r\nborers, whose tunnels may be as broad as the little finger, the foul\r\nsmell as well as abundant \"saw-dust\" betray the evil.\r\n\r\nExcavations in wood are by no means caused only by insects: several of\r\nthe larger Hymenomycetes--_Stereum_, _Thelephora_, _Polyporus_,\r\netc.--tunnel the timber in characteristic ways and often after a fashion\r\nvery suggestive of insects. They usually obtain access through\r\nfractures.\r\n\r\n_Tunnels_ in leaves are invariably due to the activity of miners\r\nbelonging to the smaller moths and beetles--_e.g._ _Tinea_, _Orchestes_,\r\netc.--the larvae of which eat out the mesophyll but leave the covering\r\nepidermis or cuticle untouched, and since the insect bores forwards\r\nonly, in an irregular track, and leaves its excrement in the winding\r\npassage, the effect is very characteristic.\r\n\r\nWhitish leaf tunnels in Peas are excavated by _Phytomyza_.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic foxy-red tunnels are mined in the leaves of Apples by\r\n_Lyonetia_, _Coleophora_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Falling of fruit_, of Apples, Plums, Apricots, etc., before they are\r\nripe, is frequently due to insects, of which the various species of\r\n_Grapholitha_ or _Carpocapsa_ are conspicuous: the fallen fruits show a\r\nsmall hole leading by a labyrinth of passages to the \"core\" or \"stone,\"\r\nand in which the grub and its excrement are visible. The cutting off of\r\nthe vascular bundles and disturbance of the water supply only partly\r\nexplain the premature fall.\r\n\r\n_Pith-flecks_ are minute brown specks or patches found in the\r\nwood-layers of many trees, and consist of dead parenchymatous\r\nthick-walled cells, reminding one of the structure of pith. They are\r\nexplained as due to the borings of minute insects, _Diptera_ or Beetles,\r\nthe larvae of which pierce the cortex and phloem and bore their way into\r\nthe cambium. The latter then occludes the tunnels by filling them up\r\nwith cells, and continuing its wood-forming activity gradually buries\r\nthem deeper and deeper in the wood. Such pith-flecks are common in\r\nWillow, Birch, Alder, _Sorbus_, etc. It is possible that they may be due\r\nto other causes also in other trees.\r\n\r\n_Erosions_ or _irregular wounds_ on leaves are caused by large numbers\r\nof grubs and caterpillars and other insects, such as earwigs, as well as\r\nslugs, snails, and other animals; but it must by no means be assumed\r\nthat all marginal leaf wounds, for instance, are caused by animals,\r\nsince many fungi which rot the tissues, as explained below (p. 208),\r\nalso cause such erosions, the putrescent parts falling out--_e.g._ the\r\nPotato disease.\r\n\r\n_Skeleton leaves_ frequently result from the ravages of caterpillars,\r\nwhich leave the coarser ribs and veins untouched, but much finer\r\nskeletons with the minute veins almost intact may be found on plants\r\ninfested with certain insects--_e.g._ _Selandria_ on Cherries.\r\nSkeletonised patches on Cherry leaves, often pink or brown-pink, are\r\neaten out by this grub.\r\n\r\n_Shot-holes_ are perforations in leaves presenting the appearance, from\r\ntheir more or less rounded shape, of gunshot wounds. They may be due to\r\ninsects which bore through the young leaves while still folded in the\r\nbud--_e.g._ Willow Beetle--or which gnaw out the tissue--_e.g._ the\r\nBeech Miner. Similar but usually more torn and irregular holes are eaten\r\nout by many caterpillars--_e.g._ the Cabbage Moth.\r\n\r\nShot-holes on Peas may be the work of Thrips.\r\n\r\nLeaf perforations are commonly caused by severe hail-storms, the\r\nhail-stones beating right through the thin mesophyll. Certain chemicals\r\nused for spraying have also been known to cause shot-holes by killing\r\nthe tissue beneath the standing drops.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a class of shot-holes in thin leaves which are due to\r\nthe action of minute fungi, the mycelium of which so rots the tissues in\r\na more or less circular area round the point of infection, that, in wet\r\nweather, the decomposing mass falls out and leaves a round hole--_e.g._\r\ncertain Chytridiaceae, Peronosporeae, _Gloeosporium_, _Exoascus_, etc.\r\nIf dry weather supervenes these holes frequently dry at the edges, and\r\nthe leaves appear as if eaten out.\r\n\r\nShot-holes in Cherry, Walnut, Tobacco, and Plum leaves are due to\r\n_Phyllosticta_, in Cherry leaves also to _Clasterosporium_, and in\r\nPotato leaves to _Haltica_.\r\n\r\n_Frost-cracks._--The trunks of trees exposed to the north-east, and\r\noccasionally with other aspects, are apt to show longitudinal ridges\r\nwhich realise on a larger scale the features of healed wounds scored\r\nwith a knife. These wounds are due to the outer layers of wood losing\r\nwater from their cell-walls as it congeals to ice in their lumina, more\r\nrapidly than do the warmer internal parts of the trunk; as this drying\r\nof the wood causes its shrinkage, especially in the tangential\r\ndirection, the effect of a sudden frost and north-east wind is to rend\r\nthe wood, which splits longitudinally with a loud report, as may often\r\nbe heard in severe winters. Since the cortex and bark are ruptured at\r\nthe same time the total effect resembles that of a deep knife-cut, and\r\nthe same healing processes result on a larger scale when the wood swells\r\nand closes up the wound again in spring. But this recently-closed lesion\r\nis evidently a plane of weakness, and if a similarly severe winter\r\nfollows the wound reopens and again heals, and so on, until after a\r\nsuccession of years a prominent _Frost-ridge_ results, which may finally\r\nheal completely if milder winters ensue or the tree be eventually\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n_Strangulations._--We are now in a position to understand the so-called\r\nstrangulations which result when woody climbers, telegraph wires, etc.,\r\nkill or injure trees by tightly winding round them. If strong wire is\r\ntwisted horizontally round a stem, the growth in thickness of the latter\r\ncauses the trapping of the cortex and cambium, etc., between the wire\r\nand the wood, and a ringing process is set up in consequence of the\r\ndeath of the compressed tissues. A callus then forms above the wound, as\r\nin the case of true ringing by means of a cut, and eventually bulges\r\nover the upper side of the wire: in the course of years this overgrowth\r\nmay completely cover in the wire, and, pressing on to the lower lip of\r\nthe wound, may at length fuse with the cambium below. Hereafter the\r\nthickening rings of wood are continuous over the buried wire. The\r\nprocess is obstructed by all the impediments referred to in dealing with\r\nringing, and of course the stem thickens more above than below the wire.\r\nIf the sapwood is thin, and the bark is so thick as to put great\r\nobstacles in the way of the junction of the upper and lower cambiums,\r\ndeath may result--the tree is permanently ringed. (See p. 201.)\r\n\r\n_Spiral grooves_ are frequently met with where Wood-bine or other woody\r\nclimbers have twined round a young stem or branch, the upper lip of the\r\ngroove always protruding more than the lower. If a kink or a crossing of\r\ntwo plants or branches of the twiner results in a complete horizontal\r\nring, the results are as in the above cases of ringing and\r\nstrangulation. Naturally grooved walking sticks are often seen.\r\n\r\n_Buried letters, etc._--These processes of healing by occlusion enable\r\nus to understand how letters of the alphabet, cut into the wood of\r\ntrees, come to be buried deep in the timber as successive annual rings\r\ncover them in more and more. Chains, nails, rope, etc., have frequently\r\nbeen found thus buried in wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the notes to the last chapter, the reader may\r\n     be referred to Fisher in Vol. IV. of Schlich's _Manual of\r\n     Forestry_, Chap.

They are due to hypertrophy of the tissues while the\r\ncells are young and capable of growth, and may be induced by a variety\r\nof causes, among which the stimulus of insect-punctures and of the\r\npresence of insect eggs are best known; but that of fungi, though less\r\nwidely recognised, plays an equally important part, and, as we shall\r\nsee, galls and other excrescences may be due to widely different agents.\r\n\r\n_Galls_ or _Cecidia_ are protuberances of the most varied shapes,\r\ncolours, and sizes found on herbaceous parts attacked by insects, fungi,\r\netc. In the simplest cases the insects only pierce and suck the young\r\ncellular tissue--_e.g._ _Phytoptus_, Aphides, etc.--but in others the\r\nstimulus to hypertrophy starts by the puncture of the embryonic tissue\r\nof a leaf, root, etc., by the ovipositor of the female insect, which\r\nthen lays an egg--_e.g._ _Cynips_, _Cecidomyia_, etc.--the presence of\r\nwhich appears to intensify the irritating action, or such only occurs\r\nwhen the young larva escapes.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the primary cause of gall-formation amounts to very\r\nlittle. Generally speaking, only embryonic or very young cellular tissue\r\nreacts, and galls on adult leaves and branches have usually been\r\ninitiated long before. The same gall-insect may induce totally different\r\ngalls on different plants, or even on different parts of the same plant,\r\nand different insects call forth different galls on any one plant. These\r\nfacts point clearly to the co-operation of both plant and insect in the\r\ngall-formation, and the best hypothesis yet to hand is to the effect\r\nthat a gall is a hypertrophy of cells, the normal nutrition, growth, and\r\ndivision of which have been disturbed owing to the action of some poison\r\nor other irritant derived from the insect, or fungus, or other organism.\r\nAttempts have been made to reproduce galls by injecting the juices of\r\nsimilar galls into the tissue, but as yet without success, and this may\r\npoint to the co-operation of mechanical irritation during the\r\nhypertrophy in normal gall-formation.\r\n\r\nGalls, in the broad sense, are not always preceded by a wound, however.\r\nInsects on the outside of young tissues may cause such irritations that\r\nthe parts in contact with the animal are arrested in their growth, while\r\nthose further away grow more rapidly--_e.g._ where Mites, etc., cause\r\npuckers and leaf-rolling. In true galls the hypertrophy may consist\r\nmerely in the enlargement of cells already present, and no new\r\ncell-divisions and, still less, changes in the nature of the tissues\r\nresult--_e.g._ some pocket galls on _Viburnum_, _Pyrus_, etc., and the\r\nhairy outgrowths of the epidermis known as _Erineum_. In other cases\r\nthere is not only hypertrophy of existing cells, but new cell-divisions\r\nare instituted: these cell-divisions may be confined to the direction\r\nperpendicular to the epidermis, and the tissues grow only in the\r\ndirection of the surface, producing puckerings--_e.g._ the Aphis galls\r\non _Ribes_, Phytoptus galls of _Salvia_, leaf galls on _Tilia_, _Acer_,\r\n_Alnus_, etc., and the curious galls on Plums due to _Cecidomyia Pruni_,\r\nand which must not be confounded with the \"pocket plums\" and similar\r\ngalls due to Exoasci.\r\n\r\nIn a third series of cases, cell-divisions occur parallel to the surface\r\nof the leaf, and galls are formed which grow in thickness, and develop\r\nthe most extraordinary and complicated new tissues--proteid-cells\r\nsurrounding the egg or larva deposited inside, followed by a protective\r\nlayer of sclerenchyma encasing this food layer, and around this again\r\nsofter tissues which may assume the structures and functions of\r\nrespiratory tissues, water-storing tissues, starch reservoirs,\r\nassimilatory, or protective tissues of various kinds, and over all may\r\nbe a well-marked epidermis, with stomata, or cork with lenticels.\r\n\r\nThe chief seat of these hypertrophies and--what is more\r\nremarkable--development of new tissue elements not found elsewhere in\r\nthe leaves, or even in the species, is the mesophyll, and various\r\nspeculations and hypothesis have been founded on these curious\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n_Erineum._--The simplest excrescences on plants are certain hair-like\r\ndevelopments of epidermal cells due to the irritation of species of\r\n_Phytoptus_, and similar insects which rise in clusters on the surfaces\r\nof leaves and by their colours, consistence, arrangement in patches,\r\nspots, etc., so simulate fungi that Persoon was deceived by them and\r\ngave them the genus name _Erineum_. They occur on most of our trees,\r\n_e.g._ Poplar, Lime, Oak, and are very common in the Tropics. Usually\r\npale or even white at first, they turn brown as the hair-like outgrowths\r\ndie and lose their sap, but since the latter may be bright\r\ncoloured--yellow, red, purple,--the patches are sometimes very\r\nconspicuous objects on smooth leaves.\r\n\r\nIn many cases these hairs exactly resemble in shape and other characters\r\nthe abnormal root-hairs found on roots exposed to the effects of\r\npoisonous reagents, or of unsuitable food-materials, or the rhizoids\r\ndeveloped from wounded Algae, etc.\r\n\r\n_Intumescences_ are similar trichomatous outgrowths not associated with\r\ninsects or fungi, and due to some disturbance of the balance between\r\ntranspiratory and assimilatory functions of their leaves, as indicated\r\nby the less localised occurrence and by their non-appearance when the\r\nplant is under favourable cultural conditions. Structures not unlike\r\nthese have been artificially induced by exposure to particular lights,\r\nand also by painting spots with dilute corrosive sublimate, indicating\r\nthat poisons may impel the epidermis cells to grow out abnormally.\r\n\r\n_Corky warts._--Several forms of disease are known in which the\r\npathological condition is expressed by the formation of cork in unwonted\r\nplaces and quantities. The _Scab_ or _Scurf_ of Potatoes is a case in\r\npoint. The tissue of the lenticels absorbs water and the outermost cells\r\nare cut off by cork and die: the cells below them burst the dead\r\nbark-like masses thus formed, and again cork is formed and cuts off the\r\nouter masses, and the rough cork warts--_Scab_ or _Scurf_--are the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe causes predisposing to scab have been variously assigned to\r\ndampness, want of lime, action of bacteria and fungi--_e.g._\r\n_Sorosporium_, _Oospora_, _Spongospora_,--the latter making their way\r\ninto the ruptured tissue of the lenticels and irritating the cells to\r\nfurther growth.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that several different kinds of scab exist in\r\nPotatoes, as well as in roots--_e.g._ Beets, and the whole subject needs\r\nfurther investigation. The scab-like rough scaly bark of Pear trees in\r\ndry districts may also be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n_Cork-wings_ are well known on the young branches of Elms, Maples, etc.,\r\nsome varieties of which have received specific names on this account.\r\n\r\n_Corky excrescences_ on leaves occur occasionally in the Gooseberry,\r\nHolly and other plants, for which no cause has been discovered.\r\n\r\nLenticels are also formed on some leaf-galls, and are remarkable as\r\nbeing structures not normal on leaves.\r\n\r\n_Pustules._--This term may be employed generally for all slight\r\nupheavals of the surfaces of herbaceous organs, which subsequently burst\r\nand give egress to the spores, etc., of the organism causing them, or\r\nmerely fray away at the top if no organism is discoverable. They are\r\noften due to fungi--_e.g._ _Synchytrium_, _Protomyces_, _Cystopus_, and\r\nUstilagineae,--and we may extend the use of the general term also to\r\nthose cases where the _stroma_ of the fungus itself bursts through the\r\ncortex of older parts and forms the principal part of the\r\npustule--_e.g._ _Monilia_, forming white or grey pustules on Apples,\r\n_Roestelia_ and other AEcidia, forming yellow or orange pustules on\r\nleaves, etc.; _Cucurbitaria_ and _Nectria_ (red) breaking through the\r\ncortex of trees, and _Phoma_ and numerous other Ascomycetes which form\r\nblack cushions. _Pustules_ on the leaves of _Lysimachia_, _Ajuga_, etc.,\r\nare due to the parasitic Alga _Phyllobium_.\r\n\r\nCylindrical stem swellings are caused by _Calyptospora_: they are due to\r\nthe hypertrophy of the cortex of Bilberry stems permeated by the\r\nhyphae. _Epichloe_, which clothes the sheaths and halms of grasses with\r\nits stroma, at first snowy white and later ochre-yellow as the\r\nperithecia form, is another example.\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical layer of eggs of a moth such as _Bombyx_ on a twig must\r\nnot be confounded with these cases.\r\n\r\n_Frost-blisters_ are pustule-like uprisings of the cortex, where the\r\nliving tissues below have formed a callus-like cushion into the cavity\r\nbeneath the dead outer parts of the cortex which were killed by the\r\nfrost; they occur on the stems of young Apples, Pears, etc.\r\n\r\n_Galls_ in the narrower sense are tissue outgrowths usually involving\r\ndeeper cell-layers. They are so varied and numerous that classification\r\nis difficult. For symptomatic purposes we may divide them as follows:\r\n\r\n_Leaf-galls._--A well-marked type is that of the _pocket-galls_ or\r\n_bladders_ in which the whole thickness of the leaf is as it were pushed\r\nup like a glove-finger at one spot, so that if the upper surface of the\r\nleaf forms the outside of the gall the lower surface is its lining. Such\r\ngalls are common on Limes (_Phytoptus_), _Glechoma_ (_Cecidomyia_), Elms\r\n(_Tetraneura_), etc. Similar localised extension of the leaf surface,\r\ncompelling it to rise up like a pocket, are caused by fungi--_e.g._\r\n_Taphrina_ on Poplars, _Exoascus_ on Birches, etc., _Exobasidium_ on\r\nBilberries, Rhododendrons, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother type is that of the _Gall-apple_, so well known on Oaks, where\r\nthe spherical swelling is solid--except for the inner cavity containing\r\nthe eggs--_Neurotus_, _Cynips_, _Hormomyia_, etc. These are comparable\r\nin general characters to the nodules on roots.\r\n\r\nFungus galls with similar external features when young are found on\r\nMaize (_Ustilago Maydis_), and betray their nature by the black powdery\r\nspores as they mature.\r\n\r\nBud galls on Willows are due to _Cecidomyia_, which causes several\r\ninternodes to swell out into a greenish barrel-shaped mass, from which\r\nleaves may spring.\r\n\r\nSmall irregular excrescences on Willow stems are referred to\r\n_Phytoptus_, and another species of the same insect induces similar\r\nswellings on Pines which are not surcharged with resin.\r\n\r\n_American Blight_, or Woolly Aphis, on Apples especially, causes the\r\ntumour-like swellings covered with sticky white fluff, which is a waxy\r\nexcretion of the insect. Galls on _Pilea_, in Java, are due to an\r\nAlga--_Phytophysa_.\r\n\r\n_Root-nodules_ or _nodosities_ are frequently caused by insects--_e.g._\r\n_Centhorhynchus_, a beetle which attacks Crucifers, _Cynips_ and allied\r\n\"gallflies\" of Oaks, and the notorious _Phylloxera_. But similar\r\nroot-galls are produced by Nematode worms, _Heterodora_, on Beets,\r\nTomatoes, Cucumbers and numerous other plants, and by the Slime fungus\r\n_Plasmodiophora_, and it is not always easy to distinguish such cases\r\nfrom the fungus-galls (_Mycocecidia_) on the roots of Alders, _Juncus_,\r\nand Leguminoseae where the symbiosis of bacteria or fungi with the\r\nroots are of benefit to the plant. _Urocystis Leimbachii_ forms similar\r\nnodules at the collar of young plants of _Adonis_.\r\n\r\n_Heterodora javanica_ passes into the cortex of sugar-cane roots through\r\nfissures, and makes its way to the place where a young rootlet is about\r\nto emerge; here it sticks its beak into the growing-point and remains\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nMolliard has shown that in the roots of Melons, _Coleus_, etc.,\r\n_Heterodora_ causes the cells in immediate contact with its head, and\r\nwhich would normally become vessels of the xylem, to swell up into huge\r\ngiant-cells, with their walls curiously folded, and containing large\r\nsupplies of proteids and numerous nuclei, reminding us of the food-layer\r\nof insect galls and of the tapetal layer of pollen-sacs. While the\r\nstimulus exerted by the Nematode thus induces hypertrophy and storage\r\nwith food-substances of these cells, those of the next layers undergo\r\nreticulate thickenings of their walls. Again instances of the evolution\r\nof new tissue elements by the action of the foreign organism.\r\n\r\nSo far as galls on leaves are concerned the amount and kind of damage\r\ndone are in proportion to the area of chlorophyll action put out of play\r\nfor the benefit of the plant, and the remarks already made on p. 193\r\napply here also. Where buds are destroyed the effects may of course\r\nextend further, but it rarely happens that leaf-galls are so abundant as\r\nto maim a tree permanently. Nevertheless we must remember that cases\r\nlike _Phylloxera_ are notorious.\r\n\r\nFar more dangerous, however, are the root-galls due to such insects,\r\nbecause here the damage is not so local: the water-supplies are cut off,\r\nand injurious consequences result from the absorption of the products of\r\ndecomposition in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the literature on galls quoted in the Notes to\r\n     Chapter XIV., the reader should consult Dale \"On certain\r\n     Outgrowths (Intumescences) on the green parts of Hibiscus,\"\r\n     _Proc. Cambr. Phil. Soc._, Vol. X., 1899, p. 192, and _Brit.\r\n     Ass. Rep._, Bradford, 1900.\r\n\r\n     The detailed study of the anatomy and histology of Galls has\r\n     been recently undertaken by Kuester, \"_Beitrage zur Kenntniss\r\n     der Gallenanatomie_,\" Flora, B. 87, 1900, p. 117, where the\r\n     principal references will be found.\r\n\r\n     On the root-galls due to Nematodes see Atkinson in _Science\r\n     Contributions from the Agric. Expt. Station, Alabama_, Vol.\r\n     I., p. 1, 1889; Percival, \"An Eel-worm disease of Hops\" in\r\n     _Natural Science_, Vol. VI., 1895, p. 187; and Molliard in\r\n     _Revue generale de Botanique_, Apl., 1900, p. 157, where the\r\n     histology is dealt with.\r\n\r\n     The nodules of the roots of Leguminoseae are not part of the\r\n     subject of this work: the literature is collected in _Science\r\n     Progress_, 1895, Vol. III., p. 252, and Dawson, _Phil.\r\n     Trans._, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nEXCRESCENCES (_continued_).\r\n\r\n     _Cankers--Burrs--Sphaeroblasts, and other excrescences of\r\n     woody tissues--Witches' Brooms._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cankers_ are irregular excrescences due to the perennial struggle\r\nbetween tissues attempting to heal up a wound, and some organism or\r\nother agent which keeps the lesion open. A canker always originates in a\r\nwound affecting the cambium, and usually in a small wound such as an\r\ninsect puncture or frost nip; if undisturbed the dead parts would heal\r\nover by cork and callus, but if recurring frost-cracks break open the\r\ncoverings, or if insects or fungi penetrate the callus and invade the\r\ncambium, irregularities of growth due to the occluding tissue on the one\r\nhand, and continued growth of the still unimpaired cambium on the\r\nopposite side of the injured shoot on the other, result in the canker.\r\nFrost cankers occur on fruit-trees, Vines, Beeches, etc.\r\n\r\nCankers due to insects are found on Apples, the cortex of which is\r\npunctured by the woolly Aphis (_Schizoneura_) while the twigs are young,\r\nand the wound is kept open by the insects nestling in crevices in the\r\nocclusion tissues. Species of _Coccus_, _Lachnus_, and _Chermes_ also\r\nproduce cankers on forest trees.\r\n\r\nCankers due to fungi usually originate in a wound primarily due to an\r\ninsect puncture or bite, or to frost, the invading fungus hyphae making\r\ntheir way into the wounded tissues and gradually extending more and more\r\ninto the cambium and the occluding callus. Among the best known of these\r\nwound fungi which cause cankers are _Dasyscypha Willkommii_ the peziza\r\nof Larch disease, _Nectria ditissima_ and _N. cucurbitula_ on Beech and\r\nConifers; less common are _Scleroderris_ on Willows, _Aglaospora_ on\r\nOaks and some others.\r\n\r\n_Peridermium Pini_ and _Aecidium elatinum_ also cause cankers under\r\ncertain conditions, as also does _Gymnosporangium_, but in these cases\r\nthe fungi are more truly parasitic.\r\n\r\nIn some cases--_e.g._ Ash, Pine, Olives--bacteria are concerned as\r\nassociated organisms in the cankering of trees.\r\n\r\n_Burrs_ or _Knauers_ are irregular excrescences, principally woody, with\r\ngnarled and warted surfaces. They are frequently due to some previous\r\ninjury, such as the crushing or grazing of cortical tissues by\r\ncart-wheels. The excitation of the tissues thus wounded results in the\r\ndevelopment of shoots from adventitious or dormant buds at the base of\r\nold tree trunks, or in the starting of the same process where a branch\r\nhas been broken off. The new bud begins to develop a shoot, but soon\r\ndies at its tip owing to paucity of food-supplies to the weak shoot,\r\nwhile new buds at its base repeat the process next year with the same\r\nresult, and each of these again in turn, and so on. The consequence is\r\nan extremely complex nest of buds, all capable of growing in thickness\r\nand putting on wood to some extent, but not of growing out in length. In\r\ncourse of time this mass may attain dimensions measurable by feet,\r\nforming huge rounded and extremely hard-knotted burrs, the cross-section\r\nof which shows the vascular tissues running irregularly in all\r\ndirections, and, owing to the very slow growth, extremely dense and\r\nhard. The dark spots in such sections--_e.g._ Bird's-eye Maple--are the\r\ncut bud-axes all fused together, as it were. On old Elms such burrs are\r\ncommon at heights on the stem which preclude the assumption of any\r\ncoarse mechanical injury, and similar structures occur on the boles of\r\nother forest trees suddenly exposed to light by the felling of their\r\ncompanions, which suggests that these epicormic shoots result from some\r\ndisturbance due to the action of light.\r\n\r\n_Witches' Brooms_ are irregular tufts of twigs often found among the\r\nbranches of trees such as Birches, Hornbeam, etc., where they look like\r\ncrows' nests, and similar structures are to be found on Silver Firs and\r\nother conifers. In the former case they are due to _Exoascus_, in the\r\nlatter to _Aecidium_, fungi which are perennially parasitic in the\r\nshoots, and stimulate the twiggy development of a number of buds which\r\nwould normally have remained in abeyance, or not have been formed at\r\nall, and only do so now in a fashion different from that of normal\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nRosette-like formations, depending on similar disturbing causes on the\r\npart of insects, occur in conifers--_e.g._ _Gastropacha Pini_.\r\n\r\nDense tufts of twiggy shoots may be developed on many trees by pruning\r\nin such a way as to stimulate the shooting out of basal buds which would\r\notherwise remain dormant, _e.g._ Elm, Ash, and thus it occurs that\r\ninjuries such as frost, insect bites, etc., may induce the production of\r\nsuch tufts in a tree crown. The dense nests of stool-shoots thrown up\r\nfrom felled tree-stumps are of essentially the same nature--partly\r\nadventitious and partly dormant buds being enabled to grow out because\r\nthey can now be supplied with materials previously carried beyond them\r\nwhile the trunk was still there. Suckers, if repeatedly cut down, may\r\nalso behave similarly.\r\n\r\n_Wood-nodules_ or _Sphaeroblasts_ are curious marble-like masses of wood\r\nwhich protrude with a covering of bark from old trunks of Beeches, etc.,\r\nand can be readily dug out with a knife. The nodule has arisen by the\r\nslow growth of the cambium of a dormant bud, the base of which separated\r\nat an early date from the wood beneath; the cambium then closed in over\r\nthe base and laid on thickening rings all round the axis of the bud\r\nexcept at the extreme apex. When the separation occurred the cambium of\r\nthe wood beneath covered over the previous point of junction, and thus\r\nthe woody bud was pushed out with the bark, and now protrudes covered\r\nwith a thin layer of the latter. Similar nodules are occasionally found\r\non Apple trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n     For further information on Cankers the student should read\r\n     Marshall Ward, _Timber and some of its Diseases_, Chapter X.\r\n     Further, the discussion as to the causes of canker in Frank,\r\n     _Krankheiten der Pflanzen_, B. I., p. 207, and B. III., pp.\r\n     167 and 172, and various papers in _Zeitschrift fuer\r\n     Pflanzen-krankheiten_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nEXUDATIONS AND ROTTING.\r\n\r\n     _Tumescence--Rankness--Bursting of fruits, etc.--Root rot--Rot\r\n     of fruits--Bulb diseases--Flux--Honey-dew--Slime flux--\r\n     Resinosis--Gummosis--Manna._\r\n\r\n\r\nI put together in one artificial class a varied group of diseases, the\r\nprincipal symptom of which is the escape of fluids from the tissues,\r\nunder circumstances which betray an abnormal state of affairs, often\r\nobvious, but sometimes only to be inferred. In many of these cases\r\nbacteria abound in the putrefying mass, and some evidence exists for\r\nconnecting these microbes causally with the disease in a few of the more\r\nthoroughly investigated cases, but in no case has this been sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated; and considering the ease with which bacteria gain access\r\n_via_ wounds caused by insects and fungi, as well as by other agents,\r\nthe necessity for rigid proof must be insisted upon before we can accept\r\nsuch alleged examples of _Bacteriosis_.\r\n\r\n_Tumescence._--It occasionally happens that herbaceous parts of plants\r\npass into a condition of over-turgescence from excess of water in the\r\ntissues, an abnormal state which indicates pathological changes\r\nresulting from various causes, often not evident and therefore regarded\r\nas internal. Such disease was formerly termed _Oedema_ or _Dropsy_.\r\nThis disease is frequently due to the excessive watering of pot plants\r\nwith large root systems and deficient foliage, in hot-houses with a\r\nsaturated atmosphere: it is, therefore, primarily referable to\r\ndiminished transpiration. It can sometimes be brought about by covering\r\npotato plants, for instance, with a bell-jar in moist, hot weather; and\r\nthis, and the prevalence of the disease in hot-houses as compared with\r\nplants grown out of doors, point to the above explanation. Similar\r\nphenomena do occasionally occur out of doors in hot, moist situations or\r\nduring wet seasons, however, and the watery shoots of rank vegetation\r\nare merely particular cases of the same class. Moreover, the well-known\r\ntendency to succulence of sea-side varieties of plants which have thin\r\nherbaceous leaves when growing inland, points to the action of the\r\nenvironment in these matters, excess of salts being no doubt one factor\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\n_Rankness_ affords another example where superfluity of water is\r\nconcerned, though it does not involve simply this, because the plant may\r\nalso contain excessive quantities of nitrogenous and mineral matters\r\ntaken up by the roots.\r\n\r\nRankness is, in fact, in many respects analogous to etiolation in so far\r\nas the tissues are soft and surcharged with water, but it differs\r\nfundamentally in the deep green of the chlorophyll: this may lead to\r\nabundant assimilation if free access of air and drier conditions can be\r\ngradually brought about. Any sudden drying, however, may be fatal to the\r\ntender tissues.\r\n\r\nRankness commonly depends on excess of food materials, especially\r\nnitrogenous manures, as may be seen in meadows and cornfields where the\r\nmanure heaps have remained on the ground and saturated it to excess as\r\ncompared with the rest of the soil; this may often be observed with\r\nweeds, etc., in the neighbourhood of farm-buildings. If the period of\r\nrank growth is accompanied and followed by days of suitably bright\r\nsunshine and dry air, the increase of vegetative structures usually\r\nresults in increased flowering, heavy crops, or strong wood; but if the\r\nrankness continues too long, or is accompanied by wet and dull weather,\r\nthe watery tissues are peculiarly susceptible to attacks of fungi and\r\ninsects, and to damage by sudden frosts or chilly winds. Rankness\r\naffords, in fact, a typical illustration of predisposition to disease.\r\n\r\n_Damping off._--When seedlings are too closely crowded in beds kept too\r\ndamp, or in moist weather, they are very apt to rot away, with all the\r\nsymptoms--spreading from a centre, contagious infection, mycelia on and\r\nin the tissues, etc.--of a fungus attack. The commonest agent concerned\r\nis one of the species of _Pythium_, the propagation of which is favoured\r\nby the rank, over-turgid, and etiolated conditions of the plants.\r\nSpecies of _Mucor_, _Botrytis_, and other fungi, may also be met with.\r\n\r\n_Bursting_ of fleshy fruits, such as Tomatoes, Grapes, etc., is due to\r\nover-turgescence in rainy weather or excessively moist air. But the\r\nphenomenon is by no means confined to such organs. Hot-house plants when\r\noedematous not infrequently put out watery blisters from the cortex or\r\nleaves, which rupture; and the stems of fleshy fasciated (_e.g._\r\nAsparagus) or blanched and forced plants (_e.g._ Celery, Rhubarb) are\r\nparticularly apt to crack here and there from the pressure of the\r\nturgescent tissues on the strained epidermis. Beets, Turnips, and other\r\nfleshy roots show the same phenomena in wet seasons. That these ruptures\r\nand exposures of watery tissues afford dangerous points of entry for\r\nparasites and moulds will be obvious--_e.g._ _Edelfaeule_, a rotten\r\ncondition of the grapes in the Moselle district.\r\n\r\n_Root-rot_ is a common disease in damp, sour clay soils after a\r\ncontinuance of wet weather--_e.g._ Wheat, especially if root-drawn and\r\nexposed to thaw water.\r\n\r\nIn the disease known as Beet-rot, the roots turn black at the tip, where\r\nthe tissues shrivel and become grooved and wrinkled extensively. Inside\r\nthe flesh also blackens and finally rots. In earlier stages, only the\r\nvascular bundles are brown and blocked with gum-like substances. In\r\nadvanced stages there is much gummy material in the lumina, and even\r\nlarge cavities filled with this gum may be found.\r\n\r\nThe rot of Cherries, Pears, Apples, Plums, etc., in store may be due to\r\nseveral fungi, of which _Botrytis_, _Monilia_, _Mucor_, _Penicillium_,\r\nand _Aspergillus_ are the chief. The fruit may be attacked while still\r\non the tree, but very often fungi and bacteria gain access to the\r\ntissues, through bruises, cracks, etc., formed in the fruit lying in the\r\nstorage baskets or on the shelves.\r\n\r\nRot in Onions, Hyacinth bulbs, etc., is frequently due to the access of\r\n_Botrytis_ or _Sclerotinia_, followed by moulds, yeasts, and bacteria in\r\nthe stores.\r\n\r\n_Sour-rot_ in Grapes, and other fleshy fruits which need much sun to\r\nripen them, is probably a usual result of continued cold, wet weather at\r\nthe cropping season, setting in when the fruits are beginning to swell.\r\n\r\n_Flux._--It is a common event to see fluids of various kinds issuing\r\nfrom wounds in trees, or congealing in more or less solid masses about\r\nthem; and owing to the prevailing tendency to compare plant diseases\r\nwith those of animals, we find such expressions as _Gangrene_, _Ulcer_,\r\nand so forth, applied to these \"open sores.\" In so far as such\r\noutflowings frequently indicate diseased states of injured tissues which\r\nare incapable of healing up, the analogy is perhaps a true one; but it\r\nmust be remembered that very different structures and processes in\r\ndetail are concerned. Moreover, liquid excretions more or less\r\nindicative of diseased states are by no means confined to wounds or\r\ndefinitely injured tissues, in which case such terms are wholly\r\nmisapplied.\r\n\r\n_Honey-dew._--The leaves, or other organs, of many plants are sticky in\r\nhot weather, owing to the excretion of a sweet liquid containing sugar,\r\nthe consistency and colour of which vary according to circumstances.\r\nThis honey-dew must not be confounded with the normal viscidity of\r\ncertain insectivorous plants--_e.g._ Sundew--or with the sticky\r\nsecretion on the internodes of species of _Lychnis_, etc., where it\r\nplays the part of a protection against minute creeping things.\r\n\r\nHoney-dew is often met with on Lime trees, Roses, Hops, etc. In many of\r\nthese cases the honey-dew is excreted by Aphides, which suck the juices\r\nof the leaves and pour out the saccharine liquid from their bodies. The\r\nsweet fluid is in its turn sought after by ants, and also serves as\r\nnutritive material for various epiphytic fungi--_e.g._ sooty mould,\r\n_Capnodium_, _Fumago_, and _Antennaria_--which give the leaves and\r\nhoney-dew a brown or black colour. Certain _Coccideae_ also excrete\r\nhoney-dew, especially in the tropics.\r\n\r\nAt least one case is known where honey-dew is formed as the result of\r\nthe parasitic action of a fungus, namely _Claviceps purpurea_ in its\r\nconidial stage on the stigmas of cereals, and this may be compared with\r\nthe sweet odorous fluid excreted by the spermogonia of certain\r\n_Aecidia_. In both cases the sweet fluid attracts insects which\r\ndisperse the spores.\r\n\r\nHoney-dew may also be formed without the agency of fungi or insects,\r\nwhen hot and dry days are followed by cool nights, with a saturated\r\natmosphere, _e.g._ _Caesalpinia_, _Calliandra_ and other trees in the\r\ntropics, which are called rain trees owing to the numerous drops of\r\nfluid which drip from the leaves under the abnormally turgescent\r\nconditions referred to.\r\n\r\n_Cuckoo-spit._--The leaves of Willows, Meadow grasses and herbs, etc.,\r\nare often seen with froth on them, in which is a green insect,\r\n_Aphrophora_, which sucks the juices from the tissues and excretes the\r\nfrothy watery cuckoo-spit from its body.\r\n\r\n_Slime-flux._--The trunks of trees may sometimes be observed to pour out\r\na slimy fluid from cracks in the bark, or from old wounds, or branch\r\nscars. In some cases, _e.g._ in Oaks, the slime has a beery odour and\r\nwhite colour, and abounds in yeasts and other fungi to the fermentative\r\nactivity of which the odour and frothiness are due. In other cases the\r\nslime is red _e.g._--Hornbeam; or brown--_e.g._ Apple and Elm; or\r\nblack--_e.g._ Beech, the colour in such cases being due to the mixture\r\nof yeasts, bacteria, and fungi with which these slimes abound. The\r\nphenomenon appears to be due to the exudation of large quantities of sap\r\nunder pressure--root pressure--and is primarily a normal phenomenon\r\ncomparable to the bleeding of cut trees in spring: the fungi, etc., are\r\ndoubtless saprophytes, but their activity is concerned with the\r\nputrefactive processes going on in the diseased wood, and which may lead\r\nto rotting of the timber.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the wounds in the bark and cortex, and which extend into\r\nthe wood and other tissues as the putrefactive and fermentative\r\nprocesses increase, appears to be in some cases at least due to\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n_Resin-flux_ or _Resinosis_.--The stems of Pines and other conifers are\r\napt to exude resin from any cut or wound made by insects, or by the\r\ngnawing of other animals; but in many cases the flow is due to fungi,\r\n_e.g._ _Peridermium_, the hyphae of which invade the medullary rays and\r\nresin canals and thus open the way to an outflow through cracks in the\r\nbark. _Agaricus melleus_ not only invades the resin passages, but\r\nstimulates the tree to produce abnormal quantities of resin, which flows\r\ndown to the collar and roots, and exudes in great abundance at the\r\nsurface of the soil. Various other plants also exude resin from wounds,\r\nand in some cases the flux seems to be increased by degeneration of the\r\ntissues, _e.g._ _Copaifera_.\r\n\r\n_Gummosis._--Cherries, Apricots, Acacias, and many other trees are apt\r\nto produce abnormal quantities of gum, which flows from any wound or\r\nexudes through cracks in the bark. Degeneration of the wood-cells, and\r\nespecially of the cell-walls of a soft wood formed by abnormal activity\r\nof the cambium, points to its origin being due, in some cases at any\r\nrate, to a conversion of the cellulose, and fungi are sometimes found in\r\nthe masses of gum; but beyond the fact that _gummosis_ is a pathological\r\nphenomenon we know very little of the disease.\r\n\r\nWith regard to such gumming, it is significant how frequently pruned\r\ntrees--Cherries, Oranges, Lemons, Plums, etc.--suffer.\r\n\r\n_Manna flux._--Certain trees, such as the Manna Ash, species of\r\nTamarisk, etc., yield manna from wounds, and in some cases the latter\r\nare due to insects, _e.g._ _Cicada_.\r\n\r\nThe Potato-disease is best known by the pale whitish fringe, giving an\r\nalmost mealy appearance to the margins of the brown to black patches in\r\ndamp weather. In dry weather the brown patches shrivel and dry, and as\r\nthey are apt to be at the edges and tips of the leaflets, these curl up.\r\nThe young disease spots are yellowish, and the leaves of badly affected\r\nplants are apt to be sickly yellow throughout.\r\n\r\nThis Potato-disease due to _Phytophthora_ must be distinguished from the\r\ncurling and puckering, with wilting and browning of the leaves and\r\nyellow glassy look of the stems, due to the invasion of the vessels by a\r\nfungus which lurks in the tubers, and gains access thence to the shoots.\r\n\r\nIn the disease traceable to _Phytophthora_ the stock remains green and\r\nthe leaves plump and plane, and only the brown patches slough out in wet\r\nor shrivel in dry weather, and are bordered by the pale whitish zone of\r\nconidiophores.\r\n\r\nIn the leaf-curl the yellow and flaccid appearance of all the leaves of\r\na stalk, or even of the plant, is the striking symptom, and the stem\r\nsoon droops and blackens just above the soil, a white mould appearing\r\nalso at the black spots. Subsequently black spots appear higher up, and\r\nbacteria gain an entrance. The stolons rot, and eventually the roots and\r\nthe leaves wither. The tubers appear sound, but are small; they are apt\r\nto rot in the store, the vascular zones turning brown.\r\n\r\nThis leaf-curl has been ascribed to _Pleospora_, _Polydesmus_,\r\n_Verticillium_, and other parasites, as well as to excessive manuring\r\nand other agencies, but it still needs explanation.\r\n\r\nRot of Potato tubers in the soil, or in store, may be brought about by\r\nvery different agents.\r\n\r\nIf _Phytophthora_ has obtained access, the fungus hyphae spread between\r\nthe cells, starting from the haulm, and cause the flesh to turn\r\nyellowish and then brown in patches. On the exterior are discoloured\r\npatches, depressed, with the flesh beneath brown and soft. The mycelium\r\nspreads mostly in the outer layers, which though they turn deep brown\r\nremain firm.\r\n\r\nWet rot of potatoes may be due to various fungi, and, in excess of\r\nwater, to putrefactive bacteria (_e.g._ _Clostridium_), which destroy\r\nthe cell-walls. The flesh becomes soft, then soup-like, and finally\r\nputrefies to a liquid mass with a vile smell of butyric acid, etc., in\r\nwhich the starch grains may be seen floating.\r\n\r\nTubers are often found with the cork burst and peeling in shreds, the\r\nflesh more or less converted into a putrid and stinking pulp, with a\r\nspotted brown boundary of partly destroyed but firmer tissue between the\r\ndark utterly rotten and the white and still firm healthy flesh. The\r\nprincipal agent in the destruction of the tissues is _Clostridium_, an\r\nanaerobic bacillus which consumes the cell-walls but leaves the starch\r\nintact. Hence a thoroughly decomposed tuber consists of a cork bag full\r\nof starch and foetid liquid. In the dried condition the flesh shows a\r\nbrown marbling; this passes into a soft soupy starchy part, and here and\r\nthere may be violet grey cavities lined with _Spicaria_, _Hypomyces_,\r\netc., the white stromata of the latter often appearing externally. The\r\nexcavations are filled with loose starch grains, and bounded by cork and\r\ncambium formed in the peripheral cells. The cell-walls eventually\r\nundergo slimy decomposition.\r\n\r\n_Spicaria_, _Fusisporium_, various moulds, and bacteria may all be\r\nassociated with wet-rot.\r\n\r\nDry-rot of Potatoes is also due to various fungi and bacteria, but the\r\ndestructive action goes on slowly, owing to there being no more moisture\r\nthan the tissues afford. The flesh becomes excavated here and there,\r\nowing to the slow destruction of the cell-walls by _Clostridium_: the\r\ndestroyed tissues are brown, and the uninjured starch grains powder them\r\nall over. Finally the whole shrunken mass has a crumbly consistency.\r\n\r\nWhen the flesh remains white, but assumes a powdery consistency and\r\ndry-rot, with the cork destroyed here and there, Frank refers the\r\ndamage to _Phellomyces_. Where the dry-rot is due to _Fusarium_ the\r\nchalk-white stromata may often be detected breaking through the\r\nperiderm; but it must be remembered that the soil-contaminated, broken\r\nskin of a potato-tuber is a favourable lurking spot for many fungi, and\r\n_Periola_, _Acrostalagmus_, and others have been detected therein.\r\n\r\nBrown spots, depressed into the flesh, sometimes result from the ravages\r\nof _Tylenchus_, the minute worms being found in the diseased tissues.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the flesh turns watery and soft, grey, almost glass-like,\r\nstarting at the haulm end, and this may be owing to the invasion of\r\n_Rhizoctonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n     The rotting of bulbs, roots, etc., has been much discussed\r\n     during the last few years in the pages of the _Gardeners'\r\n     Chronicle_, _Zeitschrift fuer Pflanzenkh._, and elsewhere. The\r\n     principal references to Bacteriosis--the rot in which bacteria\r\n     are stated to be the primary agent causing these and similar\r\n     diseases--may be found in Massee, _Diseases of Plants_, pp.\r\n     338-342, and more fully in Russell, _Bacteria in their\r\n     Relation to Vegetable Tissue_, Baltimore, 1892; and in Migula,\r\n     _Kritische Uebersicht derjenigen Pflanzen-krankheiten, welche\r\n     Angeblich durch Bakterien verursacht werden_, Semarang, 1892.\r\n\r\n     The most convincing accounts, however, are since that date;\r\n     see Smith, \"Pseudomonas Campestris,\" _Cent. f. Bakt._, B.\r\n     III., 1897, p. 284, and Arthur and Bolley, _Bacteriosis of\r\n     Carnations_, Perdue University Agr. Expt. Station, 1896, Vol.\r\n     VII., p. 17. Woods has lately shown that this disease is due\r\n     to Aphides only, the bacteria having nothing to do with the\r\n     disease primarily, _Stigmonose_, _Bull. 19_, U.S. Dept. Agr.,\r\n     1900; but it is necessary to bear in mind that actual\r\n     penetration of the cell-walls from without must be proved, as\r\n     De Bary proved it for germ-tubes of fungi, before the evidence\r\n     that Bacteria are truly parasitic in living plants can be\r\n     called decisive. This is a difficult matter, but until it is\r\n     settled we do not know whether these organisms are really\r\n     parasitic in the sense that _Phytophthora_ is, or merely gain\r\n     access by other means--I have traced them through dead\r\n     fungus-hyphae--to the vessels, dead cell-walls, etc. The proof\r\n     of infection _via_ water pores and vessels is given for one\r\n     species by Harding, \"Die Schwarze Faulnis der Kohls,\" etc.,\r\n     _Cent. f. Bakt._, Abh. II., B. VI., 1900, p. 305, with\r\n     literature.\r\n\r\n     Concerning the \"Damping off\" of seedlings, see Marshall Ward,\r\n     \"Observations on the Genus Pythium,\" _Quart. Journ. Microsc.\r\n     Soc._, Vol. XXIII., 1883, p. 485, and Atkinson, _Bull. 94 of\r\n     Cornell University Agric. Expt. Station_, 1895, p. 233.\r\n\r\n     On Bacteriosis in Turnips, see Potter, _Proc. R. S._ 1901,\r\n     Vol. LXVII., p. 442.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nNECROTIC DISEASES.\r\n\r\n     _Patches--Frost-patches--Bruising due to hail, shot, etc.--\r\n     Fire--Sun-burn or scorching--Sun-cracks. Dying-back--Frost--\r\n     Fungi--Wound fungi--Defoliation by insects--Defoliation by\r\n     hand--Staghead._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Necrosis._--This is a general term for cases where the tissues\r\ngradually turn brown or black in patches which die and dry up, the dead\r\narea sometimes spreading slowly and invading the usually sharply\r\ndemarcated healthy tissues around. It is a common phenomenon on the more\r\nslender stems or branches of trees, especially those with a thin cortex,\r\nand the terms _Brand_ or _Scorching_ sometimes applied signify the\r\nrecognised resemblance between burnt patches and these dead areas of\r\nnecrotic tissue.\r\n\r\nNecrosis is often due to frost, which kills the cortex of Pears, Beech,\r\netc., in patches of this kind. The dead cortex and cambium stick to the\r\nwood beneath and contract as they dry. The living cambium and cortex\r\naround them then begin to push in callus towards the centre of the\r\nnecrotic area; but since this callus is formed under the pressure of the\r\ncortical tissues it does not form a thick lip or margin to the healing\r\nwound, as it does in a Canker, but insinuates itself with thinned-off\r\nedges between the wood and the dead tissue, or at most traps a little of\r\nthe latter in the final closing up of the wound. It is easy to see how\r\nsuch an area of Necrosis may become a Canker if the dead tissues split\r\nor slough off, and fungi or insects obtain access to the callus at the\r\nmargins of the area, setting up the disturbances described on p. 222. As\r\nmatter of fact many Cankers--_e.g._ those of the Larch disease, and\r\nthose due to _Nectria_, or Aphides, etc.--often begin as flattened or\r\ndepressed areas of Necrosis started by frost, and many small necrotic\r\npatches would eventually become Cankers if not healed up by the callus.\r\n\r\nNecrosis may also be due to the bruising of the tissues by large\r\nhailstones, to gun-shot wounds, or to any form of contusion which kills\r\nthe living cells of cortex and cambium.\r\n\r\nNecrosis is a natural and common result of fire, and it frequently\r\nhappens after forest-fires which have run rapidly through the dry\r\nunderwood, fanned by steady winds, that the lower parts of the boles are\r\nscorched on one side only. The killed cambium and cortex then dry up in\r\nblack necrotic patches, which may eventually heal up by intrusion of\r\ncallus from the uninjured parts.\r\n\r\n_Sun-burn_ or _Scorching_.--If thin-barked trees, such as Hornbeam,\r\nBeech, Firs, etc., which have been growing in partial shade owing to\r\ndense planting, are suddenly isolated by thinning, the impingement of\r\nthe sun's rays on the south-west side during the hottest part of summer\r\ndays may kill the cambium, and produce necrosis of the cortical tissues,\r\nand such necrotic patches heal very slowly or not at all, because the\r\ndead tissues have contracted so tightly on to the wood below that the\r\ncallus cannot readily creep between.\r\n\r\n_Sun-cracks_ are due to intense insolation on the south side of trees in\r\nclear weather in early spring, causing the drying and contraction of the\r\nwood and its coverings down that side of the tree: the contracted\r\ntissues consequently split, as in the case of frost-cracks, the healing\r\nup of which is very similar.\r\n\r\n_Dying-back._--All that is true of the necrosis of cortical tissues in\r\nsmall patches also applies to cases where the whole of the outer tissues\r\nof thin twigs and branches die of inanition owing to a premature fall of\r\nleaves--_e.g._ after a severe attack of some insect or fungus pest. The\r\nconsequent arrest of the transpiration current and the proper supply of\r\nnutriment to the cambium and cortex explain the phenomena. The younger\r\nbranches of Coffee trees suffering from severe attacks of leaf-disease\r\nare often denuded of leaves and die back from the causes mentioned, the\r\nwhole of the outer tissues becoming necrotic, and drying up tight on to\r\nthe wood, because other branches with functionally active leaves on them\r\ndivert the transpiration current, and drought and inanition supervene.\r\n\r\nDying-back is frequently also a direct effect of early frosts, which\r\nkill the thin twigs before the \"wood is ripened,\" as gardeners say.\r\n\r\nDying-back is also a frequent result of direct frost action on thin\r\nwatery shoots or \"unripe wood,\" and is apt to occur every year in\r\ncertain varieties of Roses, for instance, in particular situations, such\r\nas \"frost-beds,\" or aspects exposed to cutting winds, and so forth. The\r\nnecrosis which results may affect all the tissues, or only the cortex\r\nand cambium, and the frequent accompaniment of all kinds of saprophytic\r\n_Ascomycetes_ and moulds or other fungi is in no way causal to the\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nDying-back may also be caused by fungi, and not necessarily parasites,\r\nfor cases are often observed where saprophytes only are to be found in\r\nthe necrotic tissues of the cortex, having made their way in through\r\nminute cracks, lenticels, etc.\r\n\r\nA simple case is often seen in Chrysanthemums, Roses, etc., chilled and\r\nwetted to danger point, but not frozen, during the nights of autumn. The\r\nlowered resistance of the chilled tissues enables fungi like _Botrytis\r\ncinerea_ to gain a hold, and the peduncles die-back with all the\r\nsymptoms of Necrosis, the fungus gaining power more and more as its\r\nmycelium spreads in the dead tissues.\r\n\r\nMany other cases are known where wound-fungi, such as _Nectria_,\r\n_Cucurbitaria_, _Phoma_, etc., in themselves incapable of true\r\nparasitism, gain a hold on the necrotic tissue of a wounded twig, and\r\nhaving laboriously accumulated a vigorous mycelium saprophytically,\r\nextend into other parts. In many of these cases the dying-back of the\r\ntwigs is expedited owing to the mycelium invading the medullary rays and\r\nwood vessels, and so obstructing the transpiration current. The much\r\nmore rapid spread of the hyphae up into the parts thus killed\r\nsufficiently indicates the fundamentally saprophytic character of such\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\nDying-back in all its forms is a common result of defoliation by\r\ninsects, _e.g._ caterpillars, especially if it occurs when the wood is\r\ndepleted of reserve materials, and thus cannot supply the auxiliary buds\r\nand enable the twigs to clothe themselves with a new flush of foliage, a\r\ncommon danger in Conifers.\r\n\r\nAny form of defoliation--_e.g._ excessive plucking of tea and mulberry\r\nleaves, browsing of animals, etc.--exposes the twigs to the dangers of\r\ndying-back, the accessory phenomena being similar to those already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n_Stag-head._--Old trees, though vigorous and in full foliage throughout\r\nthe crown generally, frequently lose the power of bearing leaves on\r\ntheir topmost branches and twigs, which stand out bare and brown, and\r\nfancifully resemble the antlers of a stag: hence the forester's name\r\n\"stag-head.\" This \"top-dry\" condition is frequently due to the removal\r\nof litter, or to excessive draining, or to the roots having gradually\r\npenetrated into unsuitable soil. The consequence is that some dry\r\nsummer the drought causes the breakage of the water columns above, and\r\nthe twigs die back.\r\n\r\nTropical trees may also become _stag-headed_ owing to the attacks of\r\n_Loranthus_ and other parasites, the portions above the point of\r\nattachment dying back from inanition.\r\n\r\nCases also occur in the tropics where the _stag-head_ condition is due\r\nto the persistent roosting of frugiferous bats--\"flying foxes\"--which\r\ntear the bark and foliage with their claws, and befoul the twigs\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n     The principal literature as regards frost is given in the\r\n     works of Frank, Sorauer, and Hartig already referred to. An\r\n     excellent summary will be found in Hartig's _Diseases of\r\n     Trees_, p. 282, and in Fisher \"Forest Protection,\" Vol. IV. or\r\n     Schlich's _Manual_, p. 423.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMONSTROSITIES AND MALFORMATIONS.\r\n\r\n     _Monstrosities--Teratology--Atrophy of organs--Shanking of\r\n     grapes--Barren fruit trees--Dwarfing--Distortions and\r\n     malformations--Fasciations--Flattened roots--Torsions--Curling\r\n     and puckering--Leaf rolling--So-called \"spontaneous\"\r\n     teratological changes._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monstrosities._--In a wide sense this term is applicable to many cases\r\nhere treated under other headings, and signifies any departure from the\r\nnormal standard of size, form, arrangement, or number of parts, and so\r\nforth, due to arrest of growth, excessive growth of parts, or of the\r\nwhole organs, etc.\r\n\r\nSuch _teratological_ conditions are however by no means always\r\n_pathological_: that is to say, they may be variations which do not\r\nthreaten the existence of the plant. In some cases they are clearly due\r\nto exuberant nutrition, and although they may occasionally predispose to\r\ndisease, in others they show no evidence of doing so. The whole\r\npractice of horticulture and agriculture abounds in examples of\r\nteratological sports or varieties which are transmissible by seeds,\r\nbudding and grafting, and other means--_e.g._ double flowers,\r\nhypertrophied floral organs (cauliflowers), seedless grapes and oranges,\r\ncrested ferns, etc.; and even when such varieties could not live as such\r\nin a state of nature, there is evidence to show that many of them\r\nreadily revert to the original seed-bearing or single condition, and\r\nadapt themselves to the altered environment.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the plant may exhibit teratological changes, and I shall\r\nfor the most part select cases in illustration which indicate approach\r\nto pathological states, and group with them cases known to be\r\npathological in origin.\r\n\r\n_Atrophy_ is a common phenomenon denoting dwindling or reductions in\r\nsize of organs due to insufficient nutrition, or arrest of growth from\r\nvarious causes.\r\n\r\nAtrophy of leaves is a common result of the attacks of parasitic fungi,\r\neven when the latter induce local hypertrophy--_i.e._ excessive growth\r\nof particular parts, _e.g._ _Synchytrium_ on Dandelions and Anemones.\r\n_Puccinia suaveolens_ causes partial atrophy of the leaves of Thistles,\r\n_Aecidium Euphorbiae_ of those of _Euphorbia_.\r\n\r\nThe carpels of Anemone are atrophied in plants attacked by _Aecidium_,\r\nand the whole flower is suppressed in Cherries infested with _Exoascus\r\nCerasi_, while other fungi--_e.g._ _Cystopus_, _Exoasci_, etc.--cause\r\natrophy of the seeds, and numerous instances of atrophied grain occur in\r\nplants infested with Ustilagineae.\r\n\r\nAtrophy of the grains of cereals is sometimes due to the direct attack\r\nof animals, _e.g._ eel-worms (_Tylenchus_) eat out the grains of Corn;\r\nweevils and other beetles (_Curculio_, _Bruchus_, etc.) similarly devour\r\nthe contents of grain and nuts, the flowers of Peas and Apples, and so\r\nforth, inducing atrophy of the parts left. Still more striking cases are\r\nafforded by small insects which bore into the halms of cereals, and\r\ncause atrophy of the whole ear--_e.g._ _Cephus_ in Wheat and Rye. Barley\r\noccasionally withers after flowering, the grain atrophying from no known\r\ncause, terms like _consumption_ given to the disease conveying no\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nAtrophy of young fruits is commonly due to the flowers not\r\nsetting--_i.e._ some agent has interfered with the normal transference\r\nof the pollen to the stigma. This may be due to excessive rain washing\r\nout the pollen (_e.g._ Vine), to a lack of the necessary insects which\r\neffect pollination, often seen in greenhouse plants; to the stamens\r\nbeing barren--_e.g._ certain varieties of Vine--or to the premature\r\ndestruction of the stigmas by frost, as in Cherries, Pears, etc., or by\r\ninsects, as in Apples, or fungi, _e.g._ the infection of bilberries with\r\n_Sclerotinia_; or even by poisonous gases, as is sometimes seen in\r\nWheat, etc., growing near alkali works. Drought is also a common cause\r\nof atrophy of young Plums.\r\n\r\n_Shanking of Grapes_ is a particular case of atrophy and drooping of the\r\nimmature fruits, due to the supplies being cut off by some agency. It\r\nmay arise from very various causes which bring about disease in the\r\nleaves or roots, and should always be looked upon as a sign of weakness\r\nin the Vine, the structure of which is affected, _e.g._ poor wood--or\r\nthe functions interfered with, _e.g._ water supplies deficient owing to\r\npaucity of roots.\r\n\r\nBarren Apple, Pear, Plum, and other flowers are often found to have been\r\nbored through the petals while in bud, and the whole \"heart\" of the\r\nflower eaten out by the grubs of _Anthonomus_, leaving the unopened buds\r\nbrown and dead, as if killed by frost or drought, and often erroneously\r\nsupposed to be so.\r\n\r\nThe wilting and shrivelling of Clover is sometimes due to _Sclerotinia_,\r\nthe mycelium of which pervades the roots and stock, on which the\r\nsclerotia may be found. Lucerne is similarly killed in Europe by the\r\nbarren mycelium of _Leptosphaeria_, which may be found as a purple mat\r\non the roots.\r\n\r\n_Dwarfing_ consists in partial atrophy of all the organs, and is a\r\ncommon result of starvation in poor, dry, shallow soils, as may often be\r\nseen in the case of weeds on walls or in stony places. Dwarfs which are\r\nthus developed in consequence of perennial drought are not, however,\r\nnecessarily diseased, in the more specific sense of the word; their\r\norgans are reduced in size proportionally throughout in adaptation to\r\nthe conditions, and simply carry out their functions on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nDwarfing is frequently a consequence of the lack of food materials, or\r\nof some particular ingredient in the soil, and in such cases is a\r\ndiseased condition of some danger; similar results may ensue in soils\r\ncontaining the necessary chemical elements, but in unavailable forms.\r\n\r\nDwarfing may also be brought about by repeated maiming, nipping off the\r\nbuds, pruning, etc., as in the miniature trees of the Japanese; and the\r\ncase of trees continually browsed down by cattle, or of moor plants\r\nperennially dwarfed by cutting winds, are further illustrations in the\r\nsame category, as are also those of certain alpine and moraine plants,\r\nwhose only chance of survival depends on their adapting themselves to\r\nthe repeated prunings suffered by every young shoot which rises into the\r\ncutting winds, since there is no question of lack of food-materials in\r\nthese cases.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the Japanese is to pinch out the growing tips of the\r\nshoots wherever they wish to prune back, and it is by the judicious use\r\nof this heading in, and suitable pot-culture, that the dwarfs are made,\r\n6-20 inches high at from 30-80 years old.\r\n\r\nDwarfing is often brought about by grafting on a slow-growing stock, and\r\nthis method is employed in practice, as are also heading in, pruning of\r\nroots, and confinement in pots.\r\n\r\nDwarfing may also be due to poor or shrivelled--partially\r\natrophied--seeds or such as have had their endosperms or embryos injured\r\nby insects or fungi, and although it is possible to nurse such dwarfs\r\ninto normal and vigorous plants with good culture, they do not usually\r\nrecover under natural conditions in competition with more vigorous\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n_Distortions_ or _Malformations_ may be defined as abnormalities in the\r\nform of organs which concern all, or nearly all the parts, and do not\r\nrefer merely to swellings or excrescences on them or excavations, etc.,\r\nin them.\r\n\r\n_Fasciation._--Shoots of Asparagus, Pine, Ash, and many other plants are\r\noccasionally expanded into broad ribbon-like structures often studded\r\nwith more than the normal number of buds or leaves, etc., such as would\r\nbe found on the usual cylindrical shoots. Such _fasciations_ are due to\r\nseveral buds fusing laterally under compression when young and the whole\r\nmass growing up in common, or, in a few cases, to the unilateral\r\novergrowth of one side of the terminal bud. Fasciations appear to depend\r\non excessive nutrition in rich soils. They may spread out above in a\r\nfan-like manner, exaggerating the abnormality, or they may revert to the\r\noriginal form. Some cases are more or less fixed by heredity--_e.g._\r\n_Celosia_. Fasciated stems are frequently curved like a crozier, owing\r\nto one edge growing more rapidly than the other.\r\n\r\nCauliflowers are really cultivated monstrosities. Fasciated Dandelions,\r\n_Crepis_, monstrous Chrysanthemums, peloric _Linaria_, five-leaved\r\nClovers, spiral Teazels, etc., may all, if grown with care, be kept more\r\nor less constant in the monstrous state. That is to say, the particular\r\nkinds of variation here manifested can be maintained in proportion as\r\nthe external conditions controlling the variation are maintained. Such\r\nconditions are chiefly rich supplies of food-stuffs, plenty of water and\r\nair, suitable temperature and lighting, etc. Mutilations, favouring the\r\ndevelopment of abnormal buds may also induce fasciations.\r\n\r\n_Torsions_ or spiral twistings of stems also frequently arise among\r\nplants grown in rich soils, and are often combined with\r\nfasciations--_e.g._ Asparagus, _Dipsacus_; and De Vries has shown that\r\nthe peculiarity is not only transmissible by seed, but may be more or\r\nless fixed by appropriate culture.\r\n\r\n_Contortions_ of stems are often due to the unequal growth on different\r\nsides of the stems owing to the presence of fungi--_e.g._ _Caeoma_ on\r\nPines, _Aecidium_ on Nettles, also _Puccinia_ on petioles of Mallow,\r\n_Cystopus_ on inflorescences of _Capsella_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Distortions_ of roots may be brought about in various ways by the\r\nhindrances afforded by stones.\r\n\r\n_Spiral roots_ occur occasionally in pot plants.\r\n\r\n_Flattened roots_ usually result from compression between rocks, the\r\nyoung root having penetrated into a crevice, and been compelled to adapt\r\nitself later. The distortions of stems by constricting climbers, wire,\r\netc., have been described, and fruits--_e.g._ Gourds--are easily\r\ndistorted by means of string tied round them when young.\r\n\r\nDistortions of leaves are very common, and are sometimes\r\nteratological--_i.e._ due to no known cause--_e.g._ the pitcher-like or\r\nhood-like _cucullate_ leaves of the Lime, Cabbage, _Pelargonium_, etc.,\r\nand of fused pairs in _Crassula_. Also coherent, bifurcate, crested,\r\ndisplaced and twisted leaves occasionally met with, and in some cases\r\nfixed by cultivation, may be placed in this category.\r\n\r\n_Puckers_ must be distinguished from pustules, since they consist in\r\nlocal upraisings of the whole tissue, not swellings--_e.g._ the\r\nyellowish green pockets on Walnut leaves, due to _Phyllereum_.\r\n\r\nPuckered leaves in which the area of mesophyll between the venation is\r\nincreased by rising up in an arched or dome-like manner are sometimes\r\nbrought about by excessive moisture in a confined space.\r\n\r\n_Leaf-curl_ is a similar deformation caused by fungi, such as _Exoascus_\r\non Peaches.\r\n\r\nWrinkling or puckering of leaves is also a common symptom of the work of\r\nAphides--_e.g._ Hops.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic curling and puckering, with yellow and orange tints, of\r\nthe terminal leaves of Apples, Pears, etc., are due to insects of the\r\ngenera _Aphis_, _Psylla_, etc.\r\n\r\nSmall red and yellow spots with puckerings and curlings of the young\r\nleaves of Pears, the spots turning darker later on, are due to\r\n_Phytoptus_.\r\n\r\n_Leaf-rolling._--The leaves of Beeches, Poplars, Limes, and many other\r\nplants, instead of opening out flat, are often rolled in from the\r\nmargins, or from the apex, by various species of _Phytoptus_,\r\n_Cecidomyia_, or other insects, which puncture or irritate the\r\nepidermis in the young stages and so arrest its expansion in proportion\r\nto the other tissues. According as the lower or upper surface is\r\nattacked the rolling is from the morphologically upper surface\r\ndownwards, or _vice versa_. Very often the mesophyll is somewhat\r\nthickened where rolled and _Erineum_-like hairs may be developed--_e.g._\r\nLime. Many caterpillars also roll leaves, drawing the margins inward to\r\nform shelters--_e.g._ _Tortrix viridana_, the Oak leaf-roller. Certain\r\nbeetles--_Rhynchitis_--also roll up several leaves to form a shelter in\r\nwhich the eggs are laid.\r\n\r\nWebs are formed among the mutilated leaves of Apples by the caterpillars\r\nof _Hyponomeuta_.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that instances can be found of teratological\r\nchange of every organ in the plant--_e.g._ stamens transformed into\r\ncarpels or into petals; anthers partly polliniferous and partly\r\novuliferous; ovules producing pollen in their interior, and so on, being\r\nsimply a few startling examples of what may happen. Such abnormalities\r\nare frequently regarded as evidence of internal causes of disease, and\r\nthis may be true in given cases; in a number of cases investigated,\r\nhowever, it has been shown that external agents of very definite nature\r\nbring about just such deformations as those sometimes cited as examples\r\nof teratology due to internal causes, and the question is at least an\r\nopen one whether many other cases will not also fall into this category.\r\nThe study of galls has shown that insects can induce the formation of\r\nnot only very extraordinary outgrowths of tissues and organs already in\r\nexistence, but even of new formations and of tissue elements not found\r\nelsewhere in the plant or even in its allies; and Solms' investigations\r\non _Ustilago Treubii_ show that fungi can do the same, and even compel\r\nnew tissues, which the stimulating effects of the hyphae have driven the\r\nplant to develop, to take part in raising and distributing the spores of\r\nthe fungus--_i.e._ to assume functions for the benefit of the parasite.\r\nMolliard has given instances of mites whose irritating presence in\r\nflowers causes them to undergo teratological deformations, and Peyritsch\r\nhas shown that the presence of mites in flowers induces transformations\r\nof petals into sepals, stamens into petals. Similarly De Bary, Molliard,\r\nMagnus, Mangin, and Giard have given numerous cases of the\r\ntransformation of floral organs one into another under the irritating\r\naction of fungi, of which the transformation of normally unisexual\r\n(female) flowers into hermaphrodite ones, by the production of stamens\r\nnot otherwise found there, are among the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nThese and similar examples suffice to awaken doubts as to whether any\r\nteratological change really arises \"spontaneously,\" especially when we\r\nlearn how slight a mechanical irritation of the growing point may induce\r\nchanges in the flower; _e.g._ Sachs showed that a sunflower head is\r\nprofoundly altered by pricking the centre of the torus, and Molliard got\r\ndouble flowers by mechanical irritation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n     For the details and classification of the multitude of facts,\r\n     the student is referred to Masters' _Vegetable Teratology_,\r\n     Ray Society, 1869, and the pages of the _Gardeners' Chronicle_\r\n     since that date.\r\n\r\n     Concerning torsions, etc., the student should read De Vries,\r\n     \"On Biastrepsis in its Relation to Cultivation,\" _Ann. of\r\n     Bot._, Vol. XIII., 1899, p. 395, and \"Hybridising of\r\n     Monstrosities,\" _Hybrid Conference Report_, _Roy. Hort. Soc._,\r\n     1900, Vol. XXIV., p. 69.\r\n\r\n     The reader will find an excellent account of the abnormalities\r\n     in flowers due to the action of parasitic insects and fungi in\r\n     Molliard, \"Cecidies Florales,\" _Ann. des Sc. Nat._, Ser.\r\n     VIII., Bot., T. 1, 1895, p. 67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nPROLIFERATIONS.\r\n\r\n     _Proliferations--Vivipary--Prolepsis--Lammas shoots--Dormant\r\n     buds--Epicormic shoots--Adventitious buds--Apospory and\r\n     apogamy._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proliferation_ consists in the unexpected and abnormal on-growing or\r\nbudding out of parts--stems, tubers, flowers, fruits, etc.--which in the\r\nordinary course of events would have ceased to grow further or to bear\r\nbuds or leaf-tufts directly. Thus we do not expect a Strawberry--the\r\nswollen floral axis--to bear a tuft of leaves terminally above the\r\nachenes, but it occasionally does so, and similarly Pears may be found\r\nwith a terminal tuft of leaves, Roses with the centre growing out as a\r\nshoot, Plantains (_Plantago_) with panicles in place of simple spikes,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nWe regard such cases as _teratological_, because they are exceptional\r\nfor the particular species, and as _pathological_ because they appear to\r\nbe connected with over-feeding in soils with excessive supplies of\r\navailable food-materials; but it should be noted that conditions quite\r\ncomparable to proliferation are normal in the inflorescences of\r\nPine-apples, some Myrtaceae, Conifers, etc., and that many instances of\r\nproliferations come under the head of injurious actions of fungi,\r\ninsects, and other agents.\r\n\r\n_Proliferation_ of tubers is sometimes seen in Potatoes still attached\r\nto the parent plant in wet weather following a drought. The eyes grow\r\nout into thin stolons, or forthwith into new tubers sessile on the old\r\ntuber. Similarly in store we sometimes find the eyes transformed\r\ndirectly into new tubers, and cases occur where the growth of the eye is\r\ndirected backwards into the softening tuber, and a small potato is\r\nformed inside the parent one.\r\n\r\nThreading is also occasionally met with in the \"sets\" when ripened too\r\nrapidly in hot dry soils.\r\n\r\n_Vivipary_ is a particular case of proliferation, in a certain sense,\r\nwhere the seeds appear to germinate _in situ_, and we have small plants\r\nspringing from the flowers, reminding us of wheat which has sprouted in\r\nthe shocks in damp weather. In reality, however, the grains are here\r\nreplaced by bulbils which sprout before they separate from the\r\ninflorescence. In varieties of _Poa_, _Polygonum_, _Allium_, _Gagea_,\r\netc., this phenomenon is constant in plants growing in damp situations.\r\n\r\n_Prolepsis._--It frequently happens that branches or whole plants are\r\nsuddenly defoliated in summer,--_e.g._ by caterpillars or other\r\ninsects--at a time when considerable stores of reserves had already been\r\naccumulated during the period of active assimilation. In such cases the\r\naxillary buds, which would normally have passed into a dormant condition\r\nover the winter had the leaves lived till the autumn-fall, suddenly\r\nshoot out into _proleptic_ shoots (also termed Lammas shoots), and\r\nreclothe the tree with foliage. The wood of the year in which this\r\noccurs may exhibit a double annual ring, and the vigour of the tree is\r\nlikely to suffer in the following season and no fruit be matured.\r\n\r\nProleptic branches may also be due to the shooting out of accessory\r\nbuds--_i.e._ extra buds found in or near the leaf-axils of many plants,\r\nsuch as Willow, Maples, _Cercis_, _Robinia_, _Syringa_, _Aristolochia_,\r\netc.--which do not normally come to anything, or do so only if a surplus\r\nof food materials is provided.\r\n\r\n_Dormant buds_, or _preventitious buds_, are such as receive no\r\nsufficient supply of water and food materials to enable them to open\r\nwith the other buds in ordinary years, for in most trees only the upper\r\nbuds on the branches develop into new shoots. The lower buds do not die,\r\nhowever, but merely keep pace with the growth in thickness of the parent\r\nbranch, and may be elongated sufficiently each year to raise the minute\r\ntips level with the bark, their proper cambium only remaining alive but\r\nnot thickening the bud.\r\n\r\nWhen, by the breaking of the branch above the insertion of the dormant\r\nbud--or by pruning, defoliation by insects, etc.--the transpiration\r\ncurrent and supplies of food materials are in any way deflected to the\r\nminute cambium and growing points of the dormant buds, they are\r\nstimulated to normal growth, and may grow out as _epicormic shoots_ or\r\n\"shoots from the old wood.\" In many cases such epicormic shoots are\r\nstimulated to grow out by suddenly exposing an old tree to more\r\nfavourable conditions of root-action and assimilatory activity, owing to\r\nthe felling of competing trees which previously hemmed it in from light\r\nand air, and restricted the spread and action of its roots in the soil.\r\nThis is often seen in old Elms, Limes, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is by such means as the above that substitution branches are obtained\r\nwhen a leader is broken or cut away.\r\n\r\n_Adventitious buds_ are such as are newly formed from callus or other\r\ntissues in places not normally provided with buds, as is often seen on\r\noccluding wounds--_e.g._ stool shoots. They may also be developed on\r\nroots, a fact utilised in propagating _Bouvardias_, Horse-radish, etc.,\r\nby means of root-cuttings, and the _suckers_ of Plums and other fruit\r\ntrees are shoots springing from adventitious buds on roots.\r\n\r\nAdventitious buds are also common on leaves (_e.g._ _Bryophyllum_,\r\nFerns, etc.), and are frequently induced on them by wounds--_e.g._\r\n_Gesneria_, _Gloxinia_, etc. Even cut cotyledons may develop them, and\r\npieces of leafless inflorescence (Hyacinth), hypocotyl (_Anagallis_),\r\nand in fact practically any wounded tissue with a store of reserve\r\nmaterials may be made to develop them: thus they have been found arising\r\nfrom the pith of Sea-kale, and are commonly developed from the cut bulb\r\nscales of Hyacinths.\r\n\r\n_Apospory_ and _Apogamy_ are particular cases of the production of\r\nvegetative buds on the leaves in place of sporangia in Ferns (Apospory),\r\nand on prothallia in place of Archegonia (Apogamy), in the latter case\r\ninduced by dry conditions and strong illumination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the literature quoted in the notes to Chapter\r\n     XXVII., the student should consult the works on Forest Botany\r\n     for the scattered information regarding adventitious buds. A\r\n     good account may be found in Buesgen, _Bau und Leben unserer\r\n     Waldbaeume_, Jena, 1897.\r\n\r\n     For Apospory and Apogamy, see Lang \"On Apogamy and the\r\n     Development of Sporangia upon Fern Prothalli,\" _Phil. Trans._,\r\n     vol. 190, 1898, p. 187, where the literature is collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nGRAFTS.\r\n\r\n     _Grafting--Comparison with cuttings--Effects of environment--\r\n     Relations between scion and stock--Variation in grafts--\r\n     Grafting and parasitism--Infection--Pollination--Grafts-hybrids\r\n     --Predisposition of Natural grafts--Root-fusions._\r\n\r\n\r\nGrafting is a process which consists in bringing the cambium of a shoot\r\nof one plant into direct union with that of another, and is practised in\r\nvarious ways, the commonest of which is as follows:\r\n\r\nOne plant--the _stock_--rooted in the ground, is cut off a short\r\ndistance above the surface of the soil, and a shoot from the second\r\nplant--the _scion_--cut off obliquely with a sharp knife, is inserted\r\ninto a cleft in the stock, so that the two cambiums (and sometimes the\r\ncortex and pith of each as well) are in close contact: the scion is then\r\ntied in position, the wounds covered with grafting wax, and the whole\r\nleft until union of the tissues is completed. This union depends on the\r\nformation of _callus_ at the cut surfaces, and the intimate union of the\r\ningrowing cells from each callus.\r\n\r\nThe development of the callus follows the course described for wounds,\r\ncuttings, etc., and the union is exactly comparable to the union of the\r\ntwo lips of a healing callus over a wound (see p. 197).\r\n\r\nGrafting was known and practised far back in the ages. Virgil was well\r\nacquainted with the process, and Theophrastus compared it with\r\npropagation by cuttings.\r\n\r\nThe scion differs from a cutting, however, in having no roots of its\r\nown: it is parasitic upon, or rather is in symbiosis with the stock, the\r\nroot and tissues of which intervene between it and the soil.\r\nConsequently the selective absorption, size and number of vessels, and\r\ninnumerable other physiological and anatomical peculiarities of the\r\nstock determine what and how much shall go up into the scion, while the\r\nlatter supplies the former with organic materials and rules what and how\r\nmuch food, enzymes, and other secretions, etc., it shall receive to\r\nbuild up its substance. Surely, then, if such factors as the nature of\r\nthe soil, the water and mineral supplies, the illumination, and the\r\nvarious climatic factors of altitude can cause variations on a plant\r\ndirect, these and other factors are still more likely to be effective on\r\nstock and scion, and each must affect the other.\r\n\r\nNevertheless opinions have differed much as to whether any important\r\neffect is to be seen, and on no point more than on whether the scion\r\ncan affect the stock, in spite of such examples as _Cytisus Adami_,\r\n_Garreya_ on _Aucuba_, Sunflower on Jerusalem Artichoke, etc. Recent\r\nresults, especially of experiments with herbaceous plants, show that not\r\nonly can the stock affect the scion (and _vice versa_) directly, but the\r\neffect of the changes may be invisible on the grafted plant and only\r\nshow itself in the progeny raised from the seed of the grafted plant. In\r\nother words, variation occurs in grafts either _directly_, as the\r\nresults of the effects of the environment on the graft, or owing to the\r\ninteraction of scion and stock, showing as changes in general nutrition\r\nin the tissues concerned, etc., owing to special reactions of the\r\nprotoplasm of the uniting cells one on the other, and of the results of\r\nthe further protoplasmic secretions, sortings, and so forth, on the\r\ncells developed as descendants of these in the further growth of the\r\ngraft: or _indirectly_, in that some of these changes so alter the\r\nnature of the special protoplasm put aside for reproductive purposes,\r\nthat the resulting embryo in the seed transmits the effects, and they\r\nshow as variations in the seedling. If these results are confirmed they\r\nshould meet all objections that have been urged against the transmission\r\nof acquired characters.\r\n\r\nIn fact there are analogies between grafting and parasitism which cannot\r\nbe overlooked, and should not be underestimated, their commonest\r\nexpression appearing in the alterations in stature, habit, period of\r\nripening, and so forth. These analogies are easily apprehended when we\r\ncompare parasites like the Mistletoe, _Loranthus_, or even such\r\nroot-parasites as the Broom-rapes and the Rhinanthoideae with grafts;\r\nbut they also exist in the case of many fungus-parasites, and we might\r\nalmost as accurately speak of _grafting_ some fungi on their hosts as of\r\n_infecting_ the latter with them, especially when it is borne in mind\r\nthat the effect of the scion on the stock is by no means always to the\r\nbenefit of the latter, and that there are reasons for regarding the\r\naction of some such unions as that of a sort of slow poisoning of the\r\nstock by the scion. Why do we not here say that the stock has been\r\n_infected_ by the scion?\r\n\r\nThe resemblances between pollination and the infection by fungus hyphae\r\nmay also be insisted upon. If we take into account Darwin's remarkable\r\nexperiments showing that in \"illegitimate unions\" the pollen exerts a\r\nsort of poisonous action on the stigmas or ovules, it is possible to\r\narrange a series of cases starting with perfectly legitimate\r\npollinations where the pollen tube feeds as it descends the style on\r\nmaterials provided by the cells, and proceeding to cases where the\r\npollen is more and more merely just able to penetrate the ovary and\r\nreach the ovules, to the extreme cases where no union at all is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nSide by side with such series could be arranged analogous cases where\r\nfungus spores can enter and infect the cells of the host, and live\r\nsymbiotically with or even in them, or can penetrate only with\r\ndifficulty, or with poisonous effects, and finally cannot infect the\r\nplant at all.\r\n\r\nLess obviously, but nevertheless existing, are gradations in grafting to\r\nbe observed, where one and the same stock may be successfully combined\r\nwith a scion which improves it--or which is improved by it--or the scion\r\nmay unite but acts injuriously on it, or, finally, cannot be induced to\r\nunite.\r\n\r\nBut we may go further than this in these comparisons. Just as the\r\nresults of pollination frequently induce far-reaching effects on distant\r\ntissues--_e.g._ the swelling of Orchid ovaries, and rapid fading of the\r\nfloral organs--so also the effects of hyphae in the tissues may induce\r\nhypertrophies, deflection of nutrient materials, and the atrophy of\r\ndistant parts--_e.g._ the curious phenomena observed in _Euphorbia_\r\nattacked by _Uromyces_--and some of the distant actions in grafts may be\r\ncompared similarly.\r\n\r\nGoing still further, we may compare the effects of cross-breeding or of\r\nhybridisation, where the _progeny_ show that changes have resulted from\r\nthe mutual interactions and reactions of the commingled protoplasm, with\r\nDaniel's results, in which he obtains proof of such interactions of the\r\ncommingled protoplasmic cell-contents of grafts in the seedling progeny;\r\nalthough there is no probability--we may even say possibility--in this\r\nlatter case that the effects are due to nuclear fusions, but only that\r\nthe germ-plasm of the seed-bearing plant has been affected by the\r\nchanges in the cell-protoplasm which nourishes it when the reproductive\r\ncells are forming.\r\n\r\nIn the case of graft-hybrids the matter appears to be somewhat\r\ndifferent, and we may well suppose, with Strasburger, that the\r\ncommingling of characters observed in flowers, fruits, foliage, etc., on\r\nshoots borne after grafting are due to the occurrence of nuclear fusions\r\nduring the union of the grafted tissues; though it is by no means\r\nimpossible that what has really happened is profound alterations in the\r\nnuclear substance (germ-plasm) owing to its being nourished by\r\ncell-protoplasm (somato-plasm) which has been itself affected by the\r\ninterchanges of substance between scion and stock, and therefore itself\r\nfurnishes a different nutrient medium from the unaltered cytoplasm of\r\neither.\r\n\r\nBut even here we can find parallels among the ordinary phenomena of\r\nplant reproduction. Maize plants with white endosperm containing starch,\r\nif crossed by pollen from other plants with purple endosperm containing\r\nsugar, bear seeds with purple endosperm containing sugar, and such\r\n_Xenia_ may be compared to graft-hybrids in many respects.\r\n\r\nI know of no case among fungus infections which could be compared\r\ndirectly with these examples, and it is not at all likely that we shall\r\nmeet with any instance of a fungus-hypha handing over nuclear substance\r\nto an egg-cell, and so affecting the latter that an embryo results. But\r\nthe case is not hypothetically impossible, although the distant\r\nrelationships of the two groups of organisms render it extremely\r\nimprobable among the higher plants. It is by no means so improbable,\r\nhowever, that further research may show cases where the egg-cell of a\r\nlower cryptogam--_e.g._ another fungus--may be affected either directly,\r\nor indirectly, by the protoplasm of a parasitic or symbiotic hypha, as\r\nsuggested by the extraordinary phenomena of symbiosis.\r\n\r\nSome of the variations in grafted plants are found to predispose the\r\nplant to disease, or the reverse, and cases may be cited where the\r\nresulting shoots, foliage, or fruits, or seedlings more readily fall a\r\nprey to, or resist, parasitic fungi and insects than the ungrafted\r\nplants. Daniel gives instances of such--_e.g._ among other examples,\r\nPeas grafted on Beans yield seeds which suffer more from Erysipheae than\r\nthe normal seedlings. But the best known cases are those of Vines in\r\ntheir relations to _Phylloxera_, already referred to (p. 155).\r\n\r\nSeveral instances are also known where grafted plants show more or less\r\nresistance to such factors of the environment as low temperatures;\r\ngrafted or budded Roses often suffer much from Erysipheae, and so forth.\r\nMuch research is still needed to determine how far these matters depend\r\non real alterations in the nature of the graft, or _are only true for\r\nthe localities in which the experiments have been made_, a point which\r\nhas, I think, been overlooked by all observers.\r\n\r\nGrafted plants are apparently very much exposed to injury by slugs,\r\ninsects, and the invasions of parasites during the healing of the callus\r\nand the fusion process. Here again it must not be overlooked that the\r\ncallus is, so to speak, a tit-bit of luscious, thin-walled, succulent\r\ntissue; and, like all wounds, the graft affords entrance to parasites\r\nsuch as _Nectria_ and Ascomycetes of various kinds, under circumstances\r\nvery favourable to their invasion.\r\n\r\n_Natural Grafts._--It is by no means an uncommon event to find the\r\nbranches of Beeches, Limes, and other trees which have been accidentally\r\nbrought into contact during growth, joined where they cross. As they\r\npress one against the other, they become naturally grafted, by that form\r\nof the process known as _inarching_: except that in artificial inarching\r\nthe operator cuts off the cortical tissues of the two branches and\r\nbrings their cambial surfaces together, whereas in nature the cambiums\r\nonly come into contact after the destruction by pressure, or slight\r\nabrasion, of the entrapped intervening tissues. The fusion occurs, in\r\nfact, exactly as in the burying-in of a nail or wire, referred to on p.\r\n211.\r\n\r\nNatural grafts are very common among the roots of trees, and possibly\r\nexplain some queer cases of the apparent revivification of stumps of\r\ntrees not usually given to forming abundant stool shoots. It is regarded\r\nas probable in some old forests that the majority of the roots of trees\r\nof the same species are linked up together by such natural grafts, a\r\nprobability not diminished by the fact that such roots cross at many\r\npoints, and are easily grafted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n     The student should read Bailey, _The Nursery Book_, 1896, for\r\n     details regarding the practice of grafting, and facts in\r\n     abundance can be obtained from the pages of the _Gardeners'\r\n     Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n     Concerning graft-hybrids and the variations of grafted plants\r\n     see Jouin, _Can Hybrids be obtained by Grafting?_ and\r\n     especially Daniel, \"La Variation dans la Greffe,\" in _Ann. des\r\n     Sc. Naturelles_, S. VIII., Vol. 8, 1898, p. 1, and the\r\n     literature there collected. The whole subject is largely\r\n     controversial, and much work remains to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nLIFE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n     _Protoplasm--Hypothesis as to its structure and behaviour--\r\n     Assimilation--Growth--Respiration--Metabolism--Action of the\r\n     environment--Nuclear protoplasm--Pollination--Grafting--\r\n     Parasitism--Graft-hybrids--Life--Death--Variation--Disease._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that all the essential phenomena of disease concern only\r\nthe living substance--the protoplasm--of the plant, and that however\r\ncomplex the symptoms of disease may be, the occurrence of\r\ndiscolorations, lesions, hypertrophies, and so forth are all secondary\r\nmatters subsidiary to the fundamental alterations of structure and\r\nfunction constituting the disease. It remains to see if we can adopt any\r\nhypothesis as to the nature of this physical basis of life--the\r\nprotoplasm--which shall help us to understand still more clearly in what\r\nmust reside those processes which, so long as they proceed harmoniously\r\nand uninterruptedly, constitute life and health, and which when\r\ninterfered with result in disease and death. The protoplasm of the\r\nliving plant-cell looks like a slimy translucent mass which has been\r\nsuperficially compared in appearance to well-boiled sago or clear gum.\r\nFifty years of observations and experiments with it have convinced\r\nphysiologists that it is not a mere solution or emulsion, however, or\r\neven a chemical compound in the ordinary sense of the term, although\r\nchemical analysis gets little out of it beyond water, proteids,\r\ncarbohydrates and fats, and traces of certain mineral salts; for living\r\nprotoplasm does not respond to the laws of physics and mechanics in\r\nobeying them, simply as do ordinary solutions and liquids. On the other\r\nhand, the most delicate chemical manipulation fails us, because when\r\nkilled it is no longer protoplasm. Nor does the microscope advance\r\nmatters far, beyond convincing us that this marvellous material must\r\nhave a structure far more intimate than anything visible to the highest\r\nmagnifying powers at our disposal.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, some information is forthcoming from the comparative\r\nexamination of the protoplasm of numerous different kinds of organisms,\r\nfor we have learnt that certain ingredients and no others are necessary\r\nfor its composition--namely, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus, sulphur, calcium[Note: See note at end of chapter.],\r\nmagnesium, potassium--and it is as a rule of no use trying to foist on\r\nto it any substitute for any one of these. Moreover, these chemical\r\nelements must be given in certain definite proportions and forms: for\r\ninstance it is of no use to offer the carbon and sulphur in such a form\r\nas carbon disulphide, or the nitrogen and hydrogen in that of\r\nhydrocyanic acid, but the carbon must be given to the protoplasm in the\r\nform of a carbohydrate or in some similar form, the nitrogen as an\r\nammonium salt, nitrate or proteid, the sulphur as a sulphate, and so\r\nforth, and thus water, air, carbohydrates, and the nitrates, sulphates,\r\nand phosphates of potassium, calcium, and magnesium become the chief\r\nnatural sources of the essential ingredients. Again, we have learnt that\r\nwhile there are different forms of protoplasm in the cell, and that\r\nthese react on each other, and go through cycles of arrangement and\r\nrearrangements, the intimate structure must be of that kind termed\r\nmolecular--beyond the region of vision, just as is the microscopic\r\nstructure of a crystal; but, while like the latter affording evidence of\r\norder and sequence when properly examined, the structural arrangements\r\nand changes must be infinitely more complex.\r\n\r\nAll these, and numerous other results of enquiry, have led to the\r\nconclusions that we must regard living protoplasm as a complex made up\r\nof very large molecular units, each containing atom-groupings of the\r\nelements named; and, partly on account of the large number of atoms they\r\ncontain, and partly due to the vibrations of absorbed heat, these units\r\nmust be extremely labile. Moreover, they are linked up into an\r\ninvisible and intricate meshwork, bathed in a watery liquid held in the\r\ninterstices somewhat as water is held in a sponge. In this imbibed\r\nliquid are dissolved the substances, consisting of the same elements,\r\nwhich are to serve as food, and which are to be taken up into the\r\nmolecular framework and built up into the structure of new molecular\r\nunits--or, as they may be shortly termed, molecules of protoplasm: in\r\nthe bathing liquid are also dispersed the fragments--again containing\r\nthe elements named--which have resulted from the breaking asunder of\r\nsome of the complex protoplasm molecules, and which are partly destined\r\nto be used up again, partly to be burnt off in respiration, and partly\r\nto be put aside as metabolic products such as reserves, secretions,\r\npermanent structure, etc. Among the elements carried into this liquid\r\nand dissolved in it the free oxygen of the air also plays an important\r\npart.\r\n\r\nAs new molecules are formed, by mutual combinations of the\r\nfood-materials selected by molecular attractions, they are taken up into\r\nthe protoplasmic framework, and built in between those already in\r\nexistence, thus distending the whole, and we say that the protoplasm\r\n_Assimilates_ food-materials and _Grows_. When distended beyond a given\r\ndegree, or disturbed in various other ways, the molecular framework\r\nbreaks, and some of the molecules are shattered, and as they fall to\r\npieces certain of their constituent parts containing carbon and hydrogen\r\nforcibly combine at the moment of liberation with the oxygen in the\r\nfluid around and are burnt off in the form of carbon-dioxide and water,\r\nheat being of course evolved. This is the fundamental process of\r\n_Respiration_.\r\n\r\nIt is probably the alternation of these processes of _Assimilation_--the\r\nbuilding up into the protoplasmic structure of new complex labile\r\nmolecules--and _Destruction_--the shattering of such molecules\r\nwith redistribution, oxidation, etc., of their fragments--which\r\nconstitute the fundamental process of life. Different authorities\r\nattempt to explain the details of these processes in various ways,\r\nbut there is practical agreement on the one point, that life\r\nconsists in the alternate building up of new protoplasm from the\r\nfood-materials--_Assimilation_--and the breaking down of the molecular\r\ncomplexes to simpler ones--_Disintegration_, or _Dis-assimilation_, as\r\nwe may call it. During the periods when assimilation prevails, and the\r\nprotoplasm increases in mass, we recognise _Growth_, and since this is\r\nusually associated with the vigorous imbibition of water, owing to the\r\npowerful osmotic attractions for that liquid exhibited by some of the\r\nproducts, and with consequent further stretching of the invisible\r\nmolecular plexus, the growth may be so evident in increased size, that\r\nwe are accustomed to look upon the visible increase in volume alone as\r\ngrowth; but it is essential to understand that growth of the protoplasm\r\nis always proceeding during life, even when as many older molecules are\r\nbeing shattered and dispersed as new ones are being formed by\r\nassimilation, and when, therefore, no visible permanent enlargement\r\noccurs. Similarly, during periods when disintegration of the molecules\r\nprevails, we must not assume that the assimilation of new molecules is\r\nnot occurring and that growth is not proceeding. The two processes are\r\nalways going on during the active life of the protoplasm: in fact life\r\nconsists in the play of these processes, as already said.\r\n\r\nThat numerous chemical rearrangements of the atom-complexes take place\r\noutside the protoplasmic molecules--both of those left unemployed in\r\nassimilation and of those rejected during the destructive\r\nprocesses--will be readily understood: many of the bye-products found in\r\nplants, such as vegetable acids, alkaloids, colouring matters,\r\ncrystalline bodies, etc., etc., are due to these, so to speak,\r\nfortuitous combinations and re-combinations.\r\n\r\nThe part played by respiration has often been misunderstood. It consists\r\nin the burning off of some of the carbon and hydrogen of the shattered\r\nprotoplasm molecules, by means of the oxygen of the air, which finds its\r\nway into the fluids around the protoplasm, and when it is active every\r\nact of combustion--which is here an explosion--leads to the shattering\r\nof more protoplasm molecules, and consequently to more respiratory\r\ncombustion of the products. If the supply of oxygen is limited the\r\nbreaking down of the molecules of protoplasm does not cease, but the\r\ncarbon and hydrogen which would otherwise have been oxidised are now in\r\npart left to form other compounds in the surrounding liquid, and thus\r\nincompletely oxidised bodies, such as vegetable acids, alcohols, etc.,\r\naccumulate. Even in the complete absence of atmospheric oxygen the\r\nprotoplasm may go on breaking down and accumulating various compounds\r\ncontaining relatively much carbon and hydrogen--so-called intramolecular\r\nrespiration; but in ordinary plants this process soon comes to an end,\r\nbecause the blocking up of the molecular plexus leads to obstruction and\r\ninterferes with the normal assimilation and dis-assimilation, and, if\r\nprolonged, leads to pathological conditions, and eventually death.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we meet with a cause of disease, or of predisposition to\r\ndisease. The deprivation of oxygen interferes with the normal processes\r\nof building up and breaking down of the protoplasmic molecules, and\r\nbodies we term poisonous accumulate and may lower the vitality or even\r\nbring life to an end.\r\n\r\nDuring normal life other products of the disruption of the protoplasm\r\nmolecules are nitrogenous bodies, such as proteids, and these we have\r\nreason to believe are used up again, acting as the nuclei, so to speak,\r\nof the new molecules, and so being built up again with fresh\r\nfood-materials into the plexus, to be again set free, and again used up,\r\nand so on. Others are the carbohydrates, such as cellulose, which pass\r\nout of the molecule into an insoluble form, and are accumulated outside\r\nthe protoplasm in the form of cellulose membranes, and so forth. It is\r\nthese formed products of metabolism (Metabolites), especially cellulose\r\nand bodies which result from its subsequent transformation, which\r\nconstitute the main permanent mass of the ordinary plant.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to see how another fundamental cause of disease\r\nor predisposition to disease exists in the deprivation of the protoplasm\r\nof any of the elements needed to supply--in the food-materials--the\r\nplace of those which have been permanently put aside in the form of\r\ncell-walls, or burnt off in respiration, passed out as excretions, or in\r\nother ways lost.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the indispensability of an element must mean that the\r\nprotoplasmic molecule cannot be completed without it: the same\r\nconclusion is supported by the experimental proof that these elements\r\ncannot be replaced by chemically similar elements.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow, however, that the protoplasm molecule must always\r\nhave the same number of atoms of these elements, and grouped always in\r\nthe same atom-complexes before being assimilated; nor that the\r\nprotoplasm molecule, when once built up, always breaks down in exactly\r\nthe same way. On the contrary, while the protoplasm of corresponding\r\nparts of a daisy and of a rose must contain all the elements named, we\r\nmust believe that the atom groupings are different in the protoplasm\r\nmolecule in each case; and though the molecules of the cell-protoplasm,\r\nof the nucleus, of the chlorophyll-corpuscles, etc., of one and the\r\nsame plant must have all these elements, the atom groupings and modes of\r\nbuilding up and breaking down may be very different in each case.\r\n\r\nAgain, the cell-protoplasm, bathed by the sap taken in by roots from the\r\nsoil or fed directly by that derived from the leaves, must be exposed to\r\nvery different stimuli and modes of nourishment, etc., from those\r\nincurred by the protoplasm of the nucleus which it encloses: and similar\r\nconclusions must apply in turn to the protoplasm of the root in the dark\r\nmoist soil and of the leaf in the light dry air, or to that of the\r\nsuperficial epidermis cells as contrasted with that of the deeply\r\nimmersed pith, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt in these directions that we must seek for the explanation\r\nof many life-phenomena at present quite beyond explanation. Thus, it is\r\ntolerably easy to modify the action of the cell-protoplasm of a plant,\r\nby exposing it to differences of illumination, temperature, moisture,\r\nand so forth, within certain limits; at least, since the changes in\r\nstature, tissue differentiation, cell-secretions, flowering capacity,\r\netc., of plants affected by such factors of the environment--_e.g._\r\nalpine plants brought into the plains--_must_ be due to changes in the\r\nmode of activity of the protoplasm, we must assume that the above\r\nfactors affect the latter. But it is extremely difficult to reach the\r\nnuclear-protoplasm directly by such stimuli, as proved by the experience\r\nthat even where we allow the factors to act for a long time, no\r\npermanent change can be detected in the behaviour of the\r\nnuclear-protoplasm--the essential material in the reproductive organs\r\nand reproductive process. At least we must infer that no change has been\r\npermanently stamped on this nucleo-plasm from such facts as the\r\ncharacters of the seedlings of the progeny of the plain-raised plants:\r\nif they are again sown in an alpine situation they forthwith behave\r\nagain as alpines.\r\n\r\nMust we not conclude, then, that this difficulty of reaching the\r\nnuclear-protoplasm is owing to the fact that it is nourished and\r\ninfluenced directly only by the cell-protoplasm? That the\r\ncell-protoplasm is its environment, and not so directly the outer world?\r\nWe may influence the cell-protoplasm--we may make it work harder or less\r\nactively, respire vigorously or slowly, build up and break down in\r\nvarious different ways, or at different rates, and so forth, _within\r\nlimits_; but it is nevertheless cell-protoplasm of its specific kind,\r\nwith its own range of molecular variations and activities within these\r\nlimits, and it supplies the nuclear-protoplasm with what it wants so\r\nlong as these limits are not exceeded. Consequently, while it is very\r\neasy to make the cell-protoplasm vary within the limits of its range, it\r\nis not easy to induce it to vary its effects on the nuclear-protoplasm\r\nto such an extent or in such a way that the latter is permanently or\r\nmaterially altered in constitution.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it would appear that cases do occur where the\r\nnuclear-protoplasm _is_ reached and affected by external stimuli, as\r\nevinced by some of the phenomena of hybridisation and of cross-and\r\nself-fertilisation, because we find the results expressed in the\r\nmingling of the characters of parents, in strengthened or enfeebled\r\nprogeny, and even in the appearance of unexpected properties, which,\r\nfrom the facts of Reproduction, we know must have taken their origin in\r\nsome alteration of the nuclear substance of the embryo.\r\n\r\nHere, however, we know in most cases that the principal agent\r\nwhich has reached the nuclear-protoplasm, is another portion of\r\nnuclear-protoplasm. In hybridisation, one which has been fed and\r\ninfluenced by cell-protoplasm of a very different plant; in\r\ncross-fertilisation, one fed and influenced by the cell-protoplasm of a\r\ndifferent plant of the same species, and in self-fertilisation, one fed\r\nand influenced by the same cell-protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThat somewhere, and somehow, such nuclear-protoplasm as induces the\r\nchanges in the characters of hybrids, etc., has been influenced by its\r\nimmediate environment--the cell-protoplasm of the plant--appears to be a\r\nconclusion from which there is no escape. We may obtain similar evidence\r\nfrom the experience of grafting. It is relatively easy to influence the\r\ncell-protoplasm of a scion by a suitable stock, obviously because the\r\nlatter, while handing on to the former all necessary materials from the\r\nsoil, presents the indispensable elements and compounds in somewhat\r\ndifferent proportions, dilutions, etc., from those which its own roots\r\nwould have done, and probably mingles with them a certain amount of its\r\nown peculiar products, as well as affects the modes of working and\r\ninteraction of both by the molecular impetus impressed on them.\r\nConsequently the cell-protoplasm of the scion, while obtaining from the\r\nstock all it needs within the limits of its own variations of structure\r\nand activity, nevertheless builds up and breaks down in ways or at rates\r\nslightly different from those hitherto normal to it, and perceptible\r\nvariations result when the sequences and correlations of these material\r\nand mechanical changes have affected a sufficiently large mass for the\r\naccumulation of visible effects. The limits to grafting suggest not that\r\nan inappropriate stock does not offer to the protoplasm of the scion the\r\nright materials, but that it presents them in proportions and in forms\r\nwhich are unsuitable for the assimilable powers of the latter, or,\r\npossibly, mingled with substances poisonous in themselves or capable of\r\nbecoming so in conjunction with bodies in the scion.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the action of stock on scion, will also be true,\r\n_mutatis mutandis_, of the reciprocal action of scion on stock. Here\r\nagain we may have causes for disease, or predisposition to disease.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens, however, that the nuclear protoplasm\r\nof the stock or scion _is_ affected in grafting, and we infer\r\nfrom the difficulty of modifying it in any other way in ordinary\r\nreproduction than by means of other nuclear protoplasm--_e.g._ in\r\nhybridisation--that in such cases a fusion of the nuclei of stock and\r\nscion has occurred during the grafting, and a graft-hybrid has\r\nresulted--_e.g._ _Cytisus Adami_.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible however that the nuclear protoplasm has in such\r\ngraft-hybrids been subsequently modified by the differences in nutrition\r\nto which it has been subjected, in the modified cell-protoplasm affected\r\nby the mingling of the juices, etc., of scion and stock; for it is quite\r\nconceivable that such materials may affect the protoplasm far more\r\nprofoundly than anything derived directly from the environment.\r\n\r\nIf Daniel's researches are confirmed, however, it appears that in some\r\ncases, at any rate, the nuclear-protoplasm is so altered by the grafting\r\nthat when the new embryo is developed, after fusion with nuclear\r\nsubstance from another plant of the same species, the results are\r\napparent only in the progeny, and _the effects of alteration in the\r\ncell-protoplasm have been transmitted to the nuclear protoplasm of the\r\ngerm-cells_--_i.e._ acquired characters have been transmitted and fixed\r\nby heredity. Should this prove true the importance of the results can\r\nhardly be over-estimated. The matter is too problematical for further\r\ndiscussion here, but we see that any such action may profoundly affect\r\nthe \"constitution\" of the resulting plant.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the case of fungi or other organisms which obtain access\r\nto the cell-protoplasm. At the one extreme we have cases where the\r\nprotoplasm of the diseased plant is rapidly and directly poisoned and\r\ndestroyed, as in the killing off of seedlings in \"Damping Off\": near the\r\nother extreme we have cases where the foreign protoplasm of the\r\nparasite, although it gains complete access to that of the host, merely\r\nstimulates the latter to greater activity and itself works for its own\r\nends in conjunction with it--_e.g._ _Plasmodiophora_. In such instances\r\nwe must figure to ourselves the cells of the root of the Crucifer\r\nhanding on food-materials to both masses of protoplasm--that of the\r\n_Plasmodiophora_ and that of the cell into which it penetrates; and it\r\nis immaterial whether both obtain the food-materials directly, or, what\r\nseems more likely, the fungus only at second hand and by the medium of\r\nthe host's protoplasm. In any case, the latter is for a long time at\r\nleast not poisoned or maimed, or in any perceptible way injured by\r\nexcreta from the fungus-protoplasm, although it is evident that each\r\nmust excrete various metabolites which may soak into and be taken up by\r\nthe other: on the contrary the host-protoplasm grows larger, attracts\r\nmore food supplies, makes larger cells, and is evidently stimulated to\r\ngreater activity for the time being, its behaviour reminding us of the\r\nstimulation of cells by means of slight doses of poison referred to\r\npreviously. We must therefore assume that the general course of building\r\nup and breaking down of its protoplasm-molecules go on as usual--or\r\nnearly so--in both the host cell and the invader; and that the\r\nassimilatory, respiratory, excretory and other functions are carried on\r\nin the former as in the normal cell, or are but slightly modified to an\r\nextent which does no immediate injury to its life. But we must further\r\nassume that the same is also true of the invading protoplasm, and that\r\nthe _Plasmodiophora_ is also supplied with suitable atom-complexes to\r\nbuild up its protoplasm molecules, as fast as they are shattered and the\r\nrejecta burnt off in respiration.\r\n\r\nA step further, and we come to instances of _Symbiosis_, where the\r\ncommingled masses of protoplasm of host and invader continue this\r\nharmonious action during life. Clearly there are resemblances between\r\nthese latter cases and successful grafts, and between both and\r\nsuccessful sexual unions where the resulting embryo-cell gives rises to\r\na vigorous and healthy plant; and the more these resemblances are\r\nexamined in the light of what we know of symbiosis the more they support\r\nour contention.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations as the foregoing suggest, then, that life consists\r\nin the regular and progressive building up and breaking down of the\r\ncomplex protoplasm molecules, and is necessarily accompanied by the\r\ninflux of the indispensable food-elements in certain combinations and\r\natom-complexes for assimilation, and by the combustion of some of the\r\ndebris of the shattered molecules, which combine with the oxygen in\r\nrespiration and so afford explosions which raise the temperature and\r\nenhance the lability of existing molecules, and act as stimuli to the\r\nshattering of further molecules. The results of these rhythmical\r\nbuildings up (assimilation) and shatterings (dis-assimilation) of the\r\nprotoplasm molecules are the growth of the protoplasm, with further\r\nintercalations of water and new food-supplies, etc., on the one hand,\r\nand the formation of metabolic products (proteids, cellulose, sugars,\r\nfats, etc.), some of which are again used up, others respired, others\r\ndeposited as stores, cell-walls, etc., on the other.\r\n\r\nThat the building-up process depends on the action of molecular forces\r\ncomparable to those by which a growing crystal goes on selecting\r\natom-complexes of its particular kind from the solution around seems\r\nhighly probable, and this being the case we can understand how under\r\ncertain circumstances _substitutive_ selections may occur. That is to\r\nsay, just as a crystal will sometimes build up into its structure\r\natom-complexes of a kind different from its normal molecules, so, given\r\nthe proper conditions, a protoplasmic molecular unit will build up into\r\nits structure atom-complexes somewhat different from those it had\r\nhitherto taken up--_i.e._ assimilated--with consequent modifications of\r\nits behaviour. If this occurs, the modes of further building up and\r\nbreaking down will be affected by the subsequent action of these\r\nslightly modified protoplasm units, _and it may well be that the whole\r\nsignificance of variation turns on this_. Whether the resulting\r\nvariation makes for the welfare or otherwise of the organism will then\r\nbe decided by the struggle for existence, and the natural selection\r\nwhich ensues. Such a view also implies that the energy concerned is\r\nprimarily what is usually termed chemical energy, and that every\r\ncompound entering into the protoplasm carries in a supply of this,\r\navailable in various ways.\r\n\r\n_Death_, on the contrary, is the cessation of these rhythmical processes\r\nof building up and breaking down of the protoplasm molecules. It does\r\nnot imply the cessation of chemical changes of other kinds, but that\r\nthese rhythmical constructions of the complex and labile protoplasm\r\nmolecules breaking down on stimulation to bodies partly re-assimilable,\r\npartly combustible in respiration, and partly excretory, etc., have\r\nceased, and that further chemical changes in the material are\r\nthenceforth simpler and different in kind and degree, eventually leading\r\nto total disintegration so that no units are left capable of restoring\r\nthe rhythm.\r\n\r\nIf these ideas are correct, we may define _Disease_ as dangerous\r\ndisturbances in the regularity, or interference with the completeness or\r\nrange of the molecular activities constituting normal Life--_i.e._\r\nHealth--and it is evident that every degree of transition may be\r\nrealised between the two extremes. Now, if we further assume, as I think\r\nwe must do, that a considerable range or \"play\" must exist in the\r\nmolecular activities of the protoplasm constituting life, we obtain a\r\nsort of expression of what we mean by limits of variation. The fact that\r\nlife can go on in a given plant at temperatures between from 1 deg.-5 deg. and\r\n35 deg.-40 deg. C., or in lights of different intensity, or within considerable\r\nranges of water supply, concentration of salts, partial pressure of\r\noxygen, etc., implies that the molecular activities of the protoplasm\r\nare of the normal _kind_ all the time, though they may differ in\r\nrapidity, and even in _quantitative_ and _qualitative_ respects within\r\ncertain limits; and the meaning of the _optimum_ temperature,\r\nillumination, oxygen pressure, etc., is, from this point of view, not\r\nthat the molecular activities differ in kind from those nearer the\r\nminima and maxima, so much as that they are running at the best rates\r\nfor the welfare of the plant--_i.e._ for permanent health.\r\n\r\nIf we transcend the cardinal points limiting the range of this play,\r\nhowever, and we get variations in the _kind_ as well as _rates_ of\r\nmolecular constructions and disruptions, then we pass by imperceptible\r\ngradations into ill-health--_i.e._ _Disease_.\r\n\r\nAnd similarly in relation to other protoplasm. That of the right kind of\r\npollen grain from another plant of its own species, stimulates the\r\ncontents of the ovule to produce a vigorous embryo and healthy seedling:\r\nthat of a similar pollen grain in its own flower either does no positive\r\nharm, but has a feebler effect, or it may act like a poison. That of\r\nanother pollen grain again may refuse to unite at all; while that of a\r\nfungus hypha--_e.g._ of _Sclerotinia_ on _Vaccinium_--may run down the\r\nstyle as does the pollen tube and produce death and destruction\r\nthroughout the ovule.\r\n\r\nOr again, in Clover, we may have the hypha of a _Botrytis_ with its\r\nprotoplasm unable to do more than penetrate into the cellulose walls\r\nand diffuse a poison into the adjacent cells, being utterly incapable of\r\ndirectly facing, or mingling with the living protoplasm of such cells,\r\nwhereas the protoplasm of another organism--_e.g._ _Rhizobium_--will\r\npenetrate directly into the cells, live in them for weeks or months\r\nwithout injury--nay even with advantage to their life. And hundreds of\r\nsimilar cases can be selected.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, conclude that _Variation_ depends fundamentally on\r\nalterations in the structure or mode of building up and disintegration\r\nof the protoplasmic molecular unit, brought about either by direct\r\nmodifying action of the inorganic environment--nutrition, temperature,\r\noxygen supply, light, etc., etc.--or by the mingling with it of other\r\nprotoplasm, the molecules of which since they have already a slightly\r\ndifferent composition, configuration, mode of breaking down and building\r\nup, etc., affect its molecules by supplying them with altered nutritive\r\natom-complexes, by competing with them for oxygen, etc., etc. Once these\r\nmolecules are affected, we must assume that long sequences of other\r\nchemical and molecular changes will be also modified; and although we\r\nhave no conception of _how_ these changes bring about changes in form,\r\nthat they do so is only a conclusion of the same order as that which we\r\nhold regarding the much simpler changes concerned in the formation of\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nThat such variations may be of every degree as regards profundity,\r\npermanence, kind, etc., may well be imagined; and there is nothing\r\nsurprising in our being able to induce them more easily by the action of\r\nexternal factors _in the readily accessible cell-protoplasm_ than in the\r\n_less exposed nuclear-protoplasm_; because the latter is only accessible\r\nthrough the former, or through the agency of _other nuclear protoplasm\r\nalready modified_. On these and similar phenomena depend the relative\r\npermanency and transmissibility of the variations. Our measure of the\r\nlatter only begins when the effects referred to have become manifest in\r\nlarge masses of cells, because only then do they become appreciable to\r\nour senses.\r\n\r\nFurther, variations thus induced may be of advantage to the continued\r\nlife of the plant, or in all degrees disadvantageous or threatening to\r\nits existence. These latter variations are _Disease_, and if their\r\ninterference with the normal rhythmical play of the building up and\r\nbreaking down of the protoplasm molecules proceeds beyond certain\r\nlimits, life ceases, and we have death supervening on disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n     It appears probable that calcium is not always needed by\r\n     living cells, and may not enter into the composition of\r\n     protoplasm; on the other hand traces of iron are perhaps\r\n     necessary.\r\n\r\n     The criticisms and summary of facts on which the hypothesis\r\n     regarding protoplasm here adopted is based are developed at\r\n     length in Kassowitz, _Allgemeine Biologie_, Wien, 1899, B. I.\r\n     and II., where the collected literature may be found, and the\r\n     reader introduced to the huge mass of controversial writings\r\n     put forward since Darwin and associated with the names of\r\n     Weismann and others.\r\n\r\n     It will probably be noticed that I have employed the term\r\n     molecular unit of protoplasm, and have not discussed the\r\n     question of organised structure in the latter: this is because\r\n     it seems clear to me that living protoplasm as such does not\r\n     possess \"organised structure\" in the true sense of that\r\n     term--it is, rather, busy preparing and making \"organised\r\n     structure,\" and a molecular constitution would have to be\r\n     ascribed to all \"physiological units\" of the nature of\r\n     micellae, pangens, ids, etc., as truly as to the structural\r\n     units of a starch-grain or cell-wall, or even of a crystal. In\r\n     this connection, the student will find the necessary points of\r\n     view put forward in Pfeffer, _Physiology_, pp. 37-83.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Absorption by roots,
