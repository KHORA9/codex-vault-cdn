EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n  1. Introduction.\r\n  2. Seismometry.\r\n                                     {(_a_) Theoretically.\r\n  3. Earthquake Motion.              {(_b_) As deduced from experiments.\r\n                                     {(_c_) As deduced from actual\r\n                                             Earthquakes.\r\n  4. Earthquake Effects.             {(_a_) On land.\r\n                                     {(_b_) In the ocean.\r\n  5. Determination of Earthquake origins.\r\n                                     {(_a_) In space.\r\n  6. Distribution of Earthquakes.    {(_b_) In time (geological time,\r\n                                     {       historical  time, annual,\r\n                                     {       seasonal, diurnal, &c.)\r\n  7. Cause of Earthquakes.\r\n  8. Earthquake prediction and warning.\r\n\r\n                        II. EARTH TREMORS.\r\n\r\n                       III. EARTH PULSATIONS.\r\n\r\n                        IV. EARTH OSCILLATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the grouping of phenomena according to the above\r\nscheme may be found inaccurate, as, for example, in the chapters\r\nreferring to the effects and causes of Earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThis arises from the fact that the relationship between Earthquakes\r\nand other Earth phenomena are not well understood. Thus the sudden\r\nelevation of a coast line and an accompanying earthquake may be\r\nrelated, either as effect and cause, or _vice versâ_, or they may both\r\nbe the effect of a third phenomenon.\r\n\r\nMuch of what is said respecting Earthquake motion will show how little\r\naccurate knowledge we have about these disturbances. Had I been writing\r\nin England, and, therefore, been in a position to make references to\r\nlibraries and persons who are authorities on subjects connected with\r\nSeismology, the following pages might have been made more complete,\r\nand inaccuracies avoided. A large proportion of the material embodied\r\nin the following pages is founded on experiments and observations\r\nmade during an eight years’ residence in Japan, where I have had the\r\nopportunity of recording an earthquake every week.\r\n\r\nThe writer to whom I am chiefly indebted is Mr. Robert Mallet. Not\r\nbeing in a position to refer to original memoirs, I have drawn many\r\nillustrations from the works of Professor Karl Fuchs and M. S. di\r\nRossi. These, and other writers to whom reference has been made, are\r\ngiven in an appendix.\r\n\r\nFor seeing these pages through the press, my thanks are due to\r\nMr. Thomas Gray, who, when residing in Japan, did so much for the\r\nadvancement of observational Seismology.\r\n\r\nFor advice and assistance in devising experiments, I tender my thanks\r\nto my colleagues, Professor T. Alexander, Mr. T. Fujioka, and to my\r\nlate colleague. Professor John Perry.\r\n\r\nFor assistance in the actual observation of Earthquakes, I have to\r\nthank my friends in various parts of Japan, especially Mr. J. Bissett\r\nand Mr. T. Talbot, of Yokohama. For assistance in obtaining information\r\nfrom Italian sources I have to thank Dr. F. Du Bois, from German\r\nsources Professor C. Netto, and from Japanese sources Mr. B. H.\r\nChamberlain. For help in carrying out experiments, I am indebted to\r\nthe liberality of the British Association, the Geological Society of\r\nLondon, the Meteorological and Telegraph departments of Japan, and to\r\nthe officers of my own institution, the Imperial College of Engineering.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, I offer my sincere thanks to those gentlemen who have\r\ntaken part in the establishment and working of the Seismological\r\nSociety of Japan, and to my publishers, whose liberality has enabled me\r\nto place the labours of residents in the Far East before the European\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n                                                          JOHN MILNE.\r\n\r\n  TOKIO, JAPAN;

But as these phenomena became better\r\nunderstood, and men learned how to avoid their destructive power, the\r\nsuperstition was gradually dispelled. Thus it is with Earthquakes:\r\nthe more clearly they are understood, the more confident in the\r\nuniversality of law will man become, and the more will his mental\r\ncondition be advanced.\r\n\r\nIn his ‘History of Civilisation in England,’ Buckle has laid\r\nconsiderable stress upon the manner in which earthquakes, volcanoes,\r\nand other of the more terrible forms in which the workings of\r\nnature reveal themselves to us, have exerted an influence upon the\r\nimagination and understanding; and just as a sudden fright may affect\r\nthe nerves of a child for the remainder of its life, we have in the\r\nannals of seismology records which indicate that earthquakes have not\r\nbeen without a serious influence upon the mental condition of whole\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nTo a geologist there are perhaps no phenomena in nature more\r\ninteresting than earthquakes, the study of which is called Seismology.\r\nComing, as shocks often will, from a region of volcanoes, the study\r\nof these disturbances may enable us to understand something about\r\nthe nature and working of a volcano. As an earthquake wave travels\r\nalong from strata to strata, if we study its reflections and changing\r\nvelocity in transit, we may often be led to the discovery of certain\r\nrocky structures buried deep beneath our view, about which, without the\r\nhelp of such waves, it would be hopeless ever to attain any knowledge.\r\n\r\nBy studying the propagation of earthquake waves the physicist is\r\nenabled to confirm his speculations respecting the transmission of\r\ndisturbances in elastic media. For the physicist earthquakes are\r\ngigantic experiments which tell him the elastic moduli of rocks as\r\nthey exist in nature, and when properly interpreted may lead him to\r\nthe proper comprehension of many ill-understood phenomena. It is not\r\nimpossible that seismological investigation may teach us something\r\nabout the earth’s magnetism, and the connection between earthquakes and\r\nthe ‘earth currents’ which appear in our telegraph wires. These and\r\nnumerous other kindred problems fall within the domain of the physicist.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to the meteorologist to know the connections which\r\nprobably exist between earthquakes and the fluctuations of the\r\nbarometer, the changes of the thermometer, the quantity of rainfall,\r\nand like phenomena to which he devotes his attention.\r\n\r\nNext we may turn to the more practical aims of seismology and ask\r\nourselves what are the effects of earthquakes upon buildings, and\r\nhow, in earthquake-shaken countries, the buildings are to be made to\r\nwithstand them. Here we are face to face with problems which demand\r\nthe attention of engineers and builders. To attain what we desire,\r\nobservation, common sense, and subtle reasoning must be brought to bear\r\nupon this subject.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation of the principle on which earthquake instruments\r\nmake their records, in the analysis of the results they give, in\r\nproblems connected with astronomy, with physics, and with construction,\r\nseismology offers to the mathematician new fields for investigation.\r\n\r\nA study of the effects which earthquakes produce on the lower animals\r\nwill not fail to interest the student of natural history.\r\n\r\nA study like seismology, which leads us to a more complete knowledge\r\nof earth-heat and its workings, is to be regarded as one of the\r\ncorner-stones of geology. The science of seismology invites the\r\nco-operation of workers and thinkers in almost every department of\r\nnatural science.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the influence exerted by earthquakes over\r\nthe human mind. How to predict earthquakes, and how to escape from\r\ntheir dangers, are problems which, if they can be solved, are of\r\nextreme interest to the world at large.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sudden and violent movements which we call\r\nearthquakes, the seismologist has to investigate the smaller motions\r\nwhich we call earth tremors. From observations which have been made\r\nof late years, it would appear that the ground on which we dwell is\r\nincessantly in a state of tremulous motion.\r\n\r\nA further subject of investigation which is before the seismologist is\r\nthe experimental verification of the existence of what may be called\r\n‘earth-pulsations.’ These are motions which mathematical physicists\r\naffirmed the existence of, but which, in consequence of the slowness of\r\ntheir period, have hitherto escaped observation.\r\n\r\nThe oscillations, or slow changes in the relative positions of land and\r\nsea, might also be included; but this has already been taken up as a\r\nseparate branch of geology.\r\n\r\nThese four classes of movements are no doubt interdependent, and\r\nseismology in the widest sense might conveniently be employed to\r\ninclude them all. In succeeding chapters we will endeavour to indicate\r\nhow far the first three of these branches have been prosecuted, and\r\nto point out that which remains to be accomplished. It is difficult,\r\nhowever, to form a just estimate of the amount of seismological work\r\nwhich has been done, in consequence of the scattered and uncertain\r\nnature of many of the records. Seismology, as a science, originated\r\nlate, chiefly owing to the facts that centres of civilisation are\r\nseldom in the most disturbed regions, and that earthquake-shaken\r\ncountries are widely separated from each other.\r\n\r\nAs every portion of the habitable globe appears to have been shaken\r\nmore or less by earthquakes, and as these phenomena are so terrible in\r\ntheir nature, we can readily understand why seismological literature is\r\nextensive. In the annals of almost every country which has a written\r\nhistory, references are made to seismic disturbances.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the attention which earthquakes have received may be\r\ngathered from the fact that Professor Alexis Perrey, of Dijon, who\r\nhas published some sixty memoirs on this subject, gave, in 1856, a\r\ncatalogue of 1,837 works devoted to seismology.[1] In 1858 Mr. Robert\r\nMallet published in the Reports of the British Association a list of\r\nseveral hundred works relating to earthquakes. Sixty-five of these\r\nworks are to be found in the British Museum. So far as literature is\r\nconcerned, earthquakes have received as much attention in the East as\r\nin the West. In China there are many works treating on earthquakes, and\r\nthe attention which these phenomena received may be judged of from the\r\nfact that in A.D. 136 the Government appointed a commission\r\nto inquire into the subject. Even the isolated empire of Japan can\r\nboast of at least sixty-five works on earthquakes, seven of which\r\nare earthquake calendars, and twenty-three earthquake monographs.[2]\r\nBesides those treating especially of earthquakes, there are innumerable\r\nreferences to such disturbances in various histories, in the\r\ntransactions of learned societies, and in periodicals. To attempt to\r\ngive a complete catalogue of even the books which have been written\r\nwould be to enter on a work of compilation which would occupy many\r\nyears, and could never be satisfactorily finished.\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,’ which were\r\nissued in the eighteenth century, there are about one hundred and\r\neighty separate communications on earthquakes; and in the ‘Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine’ for 1755 there are no less than fifty notes and articles on\r\nthe same subject. The great interest shown in earthquakes about the\r\nyears 1750–60 in England, was chiefly due to the terrible calamity\r\nwhich overtook Lisbon in 1755, and to the fact that about this time\r\nseveral shocks were experienced in various parts of the British\r\nIslands. In 1750, which may be described as the earthquake year of\r\nBritain, ‘a shock was felt in Surrey on March 14; on the 18th of the\r\nsame month the whole of the south-west of England was disturbed. On\r\nApril 2, Chester was shaken; on June 7, Norwich was disturbed; on\r\nAugust 23, the inhabitants of Lancashire were alarmed; and on September\r\n30 ludicrous and alarming scenes occurred in consequence of a shock\r\nhaving been felt during the hours of Divine service, causing the\r\ncongregations to hurry into the open air.’[3] As might be expected,\r\nthese occurrences gave rise to many articles and notes directing\r\nattention to the subject of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nSeismic literature has not, however, at all times been a measure of\r\nseismic activity: thus, in Japan, the earthquake records for the\r\ntwelfth and sixteenth centuries scarcely mention any shocks. At first\r\nsight it might be imagined that this was owing to an absence of\r\nearthquakes; but it is sufficiently accounted for by the fact that\r\nat that time the country was torn with civil war, and matters more\r\nurgent than the recording of natural phenomena engaged the attention of\r\nthe inhabitants. Professor Rockwood, who has given so much attention\r\nto seismic disturbances in America, tells us that during the recent\r\ncontest between Chili and Peru a similar intermission is observable. We\r\nsee, therefore, that an absence of records does not necessarily imply\r\nan absence of the phenomena to be recorded.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the earliest existing records of earthquakes are those which\r\noccur in the Bible. The first of these, which we are told occurred in\r\nPalestine, was in the reign of Ahab (B.C. 918–897).[4] One of the most\r\nterrible earthquakes mentioned in the Bible is that which took place\r\nin the days of Uzziah, king of Judah (B.C. 811–759), which shook the\r\nground and rent the Temple. The awful character of this, and the deep\r\nimpression produced on men’s minds, may be learned from the fact that\r\nthe time of its occurrence was subsequently used as an epoch from which\r\nto reckon dates.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Herodotus, Pliny, Livy, &c., &c., show the interest\r\nwhich earthquakes attracted in early ages. These writers chiefly\r\ndevoted themselves to references and descriptions of disastrous shocks,\r\nand to theories respecting the cause of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the Japanese notices of earthquakes is simply\r\na series of anecdotes of events which took place at the time of\r\nthese disasters. We also find references to superstitious beliefs,\r\ncurious occurrences, and the apparent connection between earthquake\r\ndisturbances and other natural phenomena. In these respects the\r\nliterature of the East closely resembles that of the West. The\r\nearthquake calendars of the East, however, form a class of books which\r\ncan hardly be said to find their parallel in Europe;[5] while, on the\r\nother hand, the latter possesses types of books and pamphlets which do\r\nnot appear to have a parallel elsewhere. These are the more or less\r\ntheological works—‘Moral Reflections on Earthquakes,’ ‘Sermons’ which\r\nhave been preached on earthquakes, ‘Prayers’ which have been appointed\r\nto be read.[6]\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, it may be said that the writings of the ancients,\r\nand those of the Middle Ages, down to the commencement of the\r\nnineteenth century, tended to the propagation of superstition and to\r\ntheories based on speculations with few and imperfect facts for their\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nAmong the efforts which have been made in modern times to raise\r\nseismology to a higher level, is that of Professor Perrey, of Dijon,\r\nwho commenced in 1840 a series of extensive catalogues embracing\r\nthe earthquakes of the world. These catalogues enabled Perrey, and\r\nsubsequently Mallet in his reports to the British Association, to\r\ndiscuss the periodicity of earthquakes, with reference to the seasons\r\nand to other phenomena, in a more general manner than it had been\r\npossible for previous workers to accomplish. The facts thus accumulated\r\nalso enabled Mallet to discuss earthquakes in general, and the various\r\nphenomena which they present were sifted and classified for inspection.\r\nAnother great impetus which observational seismology received was Mr.\r\nMallet’s report upon the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857, in which new\r\nmethods of seismic investigation were put forth. These have formed\r\nthe working tools of many subsequent observers, and by them, as well\r\nas by his experiments on artificially produced disturbances, Mallet\r\nfinally drew the study of earthquakes from the realms of speculation by\r\nshowing that they, like other natural phenomena, were capable of being\r\nunderstood and investigated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Perrey and Mallet, the nineteenth century has produced\r\nmany writers who have taken a considerable share in the advancement of\r\nseismology. There are the catalogues of Von Hoff, the observations of\r\nHumboldt, the theoretical investigations of Hopkins, the monographs of\r\nSchmidt, Seebach, Lasaulx, and others; the books of Fuchs, Credner,\r\nVogt, Volger; the records and observations of Palmieri, Bertelli,\r\nRossi, and other Italian observers. To these, which are only a few\r\nout of a long list of names, may be added the publications of the\r\nCommission appointed for the observation of earthquakes by the Natural\r\nHistory Society of Switzerland, and the volumes which have been\r\npublished by the Seismological Society of Japan.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter it will be well to define a few of the\r\nmore ordinary terms which are used in describing earthquake phenomena.\r\nIt may be observed that the English word _earthquake_, the German\r\n_erdbeben_, the French _tremblement de terre_, the Spanish _terremoto_,\r\nthe Japanese _jishin_ &c., all mean, when literally translated,\r\n_earth-shaking_, and are popularly understood to mean a sudden and more\r\nor less violent disturbance.\r\n\r\nSeismology (σειμός an earthquake, λόγος a discourse) in its simplest\r\nsense means the study of earthquakes. To be consistent with a Greek\r\nbasis for seismological terminology, some writers have thrown aside\r\nthe familiar expression ‘earthquake,’ and substituted the awkward word\r\n‘seism.’\r\n\r\nThe source from which an earthquake originates is called the ‘origin,’\r\n‘focal cavity,’ or ‘centrum.’\r\n\r\nThe point or area on the surface of the ground above the origin is\r\ncalled the ‘epicentrum.’ The line joining the centrum and epicentrum is\r\ncalled the ‘seismic vertical.’\r\n\r\nThe radial lines along which an earthquake may be propagated from the\r\ncentrum are called ‘wave paths.’\r\n\r\nThe angle which a wave path, where it reaches the surface of the earth,\r\nmakes with that surface is called the ‘angle of emergence’ of the wave.\r\nThis angle is usually denoted by the letter _e_.\r\n\r\nAs the result of a simple explosion at a point in a homogeneous medium,\r\nwe ought, theoretically, to obtain at points on the surface of the\r\nmedium equidistant from the epicentrum, equal mechanical effects.\r\nThese points will lie on circles called ‘isoseismic’ or ‘coseismic’\r\ncircles. The area included between two such circles is an ‘isoseismic\r\narea.’ In nature, however, isoseismic lines are seldom circles.\r\nElliptical or irregular curves are the common forms.\r\n\r\nThe isoseismic area in which the greatest disturbance has taken place\r\nis called the ‘meizoseismic area.’ Seebach calls the lines enclosing\r\nthis area ‘pleistoseists.’\r\n\r\nThese last-mentioned lines are wholly due to Mallet and Seebach.\r\n\r\nMany words are used to distinguish different kinds of earthquakes from\r\neach other. All of these appear to be very indefinite and to depend\r\nupon the observer’s feelings, which, in turn, depend upon his nervous\r\ntemperament and his situation.\r\n\r\nIn South America small earthquakes, consisting of a series of rapidly\r\nrecurring vibratory movements not sufficiently powerful to create\r\ndamage, are spoken of as _trembelores_.\r\n\r\nThe _terremotos_ of South America are earthquakes of a destructive\r\nnature, in which distinct shocks are perceptible. It may be observed\r\nthat shocks which at one place would be described as _terremoto_\r\nwould at another and more distant place probably be described as\r\n_trembelores_.\r\n\r\nThe _succussatore_ are the shocks where there is considerable vertical\r\nmotion. The terrible shock of Riobamba (February 4, 1797), which is\r\nsaid to have thrown corpses from their graves to a height of 100 feet,\r\nwas an earthquake of this order.\r\n\r\nThe _vorticosi_ are shocks which have a twisting or rotatory motion.\r\n\r\nAnother method of describing earthquakes would be to refer to\r\ninstrumental records. When the vibrations of the ground have only\r\nbeen along the line joining the observer and the epicentrum, the\r\ndisturbance might be called ‘euthutropic.’ A disturbance in which the\r\nprominent movements are _transverse_ to the above direction might be\r\ncalled ‘diagonic.’ If motions in both of these directions occur in the\r\nrecords, the shock might be said to be ‘diastrophic.’ If there be much\r\nvertical movement, the shock might be said to be ‘anaseismic.’ Some\r\ndisturbances could only be described by using two or three of these\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                             SEISMOMETRY.\r\n\r\n  Nature of earthquake vibrations—Many instruments called\r\n    seismometers only seismoscopes—Eastern seismoscopes, columns,\r\n    projection seismometers—Vessels filled with liquid—Palmieri’s\r\n    mercury tubes—The ship seismoscope—The cacciatore—Pendulum\r\n    instruments of Kreil, Wagner, Ewing, and Gray—Bracket\r\n    seismographs—West’s parallel motion instrument—Gray’s conical\r\n    pendulums, rolling spheres, and cylinders—Verbeck’s ball and\r\n    plate seismograph—The principle of Perry and Ayrton—Vertical\r\n    motion instruments—Record receivers—Time-recording apparatus—The\r\n    Gray and Milne seismograph.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we discuss the nature of earthquake motion, the determination\r\nof which has been the aim of modern seismological investigation, the\r\nreader will naturally look for an account of the various instruments\r\nwhich have been employed for recording such disturbances. A description\r\nof the earthquake machines which have been used even in Japan would\r\nform a bulky volume. All that we can do, therefore, is to describe\r\nbriefly the more prominent features of a few of the more important of\r\nthese instruments. In order that the relative merits of these may be\r\nbetter understood, we may state generally that modern research has\r\nshown a typical earthquake to consist of a series of small tremors\r\nsucceeded by a shock, or series of shocks, separated by more or less\r\nirregular vibrations of the ground. The vibrations are often both\r\nirregular in period and in amplitude, and they have a duration of from\r\na few seconds to several minutes. We will illustrate the records of\r\nactual earthquakes in a future chapter, but in the meantime the idea\r\nthat an earthquake consists of a single shock must be dismissed from\r\nthe imagination.\r\n\r\nTo construct an instrument which at the time of an earthquake shall\r\nmove and leave a record of its motion, there is but little difficulty.\r\nContrivances of this order are called _seismoscopes_. If, however,\r\nwe wish to know the period, extent, and direction of each of the\r\nvibrations which constitutes an earthquake, we have considerable\r\ndifficulty. Instruments which will in this way measure or write down\r\nthe earth’s motions are called _seismometers_ or _seismographs_.\r\n\r\nMany of the elaborate instruments supplemented with electro-magnetic\r\nand clockwork arrangements are, when we examine them, nothing more than\r\nelaborate seismoscopes which have been erroneously termed seismographs.\r\n\r\nThe only approximations to true seismographs which have yet been\r\ninvented are without doubt those which during the past few years have\r\nbeen used in Japan. It would be a somewhat arbitrary proceeding,\r\nhowever, to classify the different instruments as seismoscopes,\r\nseismometers, and seismographs, as the character of the record given\r\nby certain instruments is sometimes only seismoscopic, whilst at other\r\ntimes it is seismometric, depending on the nature of the disturbance.\r\nMany instruments, for instance, would record with considerable accuracy\r\na single sudden movement, but would give no reliable information\r\nregarding a continued shaking.\r\n\r\n_Eastern Seismoscopes._—The earliest seismoscope of which we find any\r\nhistorical record is one which owes its origin to a Chinese called\r\nChôko. It was invented in the year A.D. 136. A description is given\r\nin the Chinese history called ‘Gokanjo,’ and the translation of this\r\ndescription runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n‘In the first year of Yōka, A.D. 136, a Chinese called Chôko invented\r\nthe seismometer shown in the accompanying drawing. This instrument\r\nconsists of a spherically formed copper vessel, the diameter of which\r\nis eight feet. It is covered at its top, and in form resembles a\r\nwine-bottle. Its outer part is ornamented by the figures of different\r\nkinds of birds and animals, and old peculiar-looking letters. In the\r\ninner part of this instrument a column is so suspended that it can\r\nmove in eight directions. Also, in the inside of the bottle, there is\r\nan arrangement by which some record of an earthquake is made according\r\nto the movement of the pillar. On the outside of the bottle there\r\nare eight dragon heads, each of which holds a ball in its mouth.\r\nUnderneath these heads there are eight frogs so placed that they appear\r\nto watch the dragon’s face, so that they are ready to receive the ball\r\nif it should be dropped. All the arrangements which cause the pillar to\r\nknock the ball out of the dragon’s mouth are well hidden in the bottle.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n‘When an earthquake occurs, and the bottle is shaken, the dragon\r\ninstantly drops the ball, and the frog which receives it vibrates\r\nvigorously; any one watching this instrument can easily observe\r\nearthquakes.’\r\n\r\nWith this arrangement, although one dragon may drop a ball, it is\r\nnot necessary for the other seven dragons to drop their balls unless\r\nthe movement has been in all directions; thus we can easily tell the\r\ndirection of an earthquake.\r\n\r\n‘Once upon a time a dragon dropped its ball without any earthquake\r\nbeing observed, and the people therefore thought the instrument of\r\nno use, but after two or three days a notice came saying that an\r\nearthquake had taken place at Rōsei. Hearing of this, those who doubted\r\nthe use of this instrument began to believe in it again. After this\r\ningenious instrument had been invented by Chōko, the Chinese Government\r\nwisely appointed a secretary to make observations on earthquakes.’\r\n\r\nNot only is this instrument of interest on account of its antiquity,\r\nbut it is also of interest on account of the close resemblance it bears\r\nto many of the instruments of modern times.\r\n\r\nAnother earthquake instrument also of Eastern origin is the magnetic\r\nseismoscope of Japan.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the destructive earthquake of 1855, which devastated\r\na great portion of Tokio, the owner of a spectacle shop in Asakusa\r\nobserved that a magnet dropped some old iron nails and keys which had\r\nbeen attached to it. From this occurrence the owner thought that the\r\nmagnet had, in consequence of its age, lost its powers. About two hours\r\nafterwards, however, the great earthquake took place, after which the\r\nmagnet was observed to have regained its powers. This occurrence led\r\nto the construction of the seismoscope, which is illustrated in a book\r\ncalled the ‘Ansei-Kembun-Roku,’ or a description of the earthquake of\r\n1855, and examples of the instrument are still to be seen in Tokio.\r\nThese instruments consist of a piece of magnetic iron ore, which holds\r\nup a piece of iron like a nail. This nail is connected, by means of a\r\nstring, with a train of clockwork communicating with an alarm. If the\r\nnail falls a catch is released and the clockwork set in motion, and\r\nwarning given by the ringing of a bell. It does not appear that this\r\ninstrument has ever acted with success.\r\n\r\n_Columns._—One of the commonest forms of seismoscope, and one which\r\nhas been very widely used, consists of a round column of wood, metal,\r\nor other suitable material, placed, with its axis vertical, on a level\r\nplane, and surrounded by some soft material such as loose sand to\r\nprevent it rolling should it be overturned. The fall of such a column\r\nindicates that a shaking or shock has taken place. Attempts have been\r\nmade by using a number of columns of different sizes to make these\r\nindications seismometric, but they seldom give reliable information\r\neither as to intensity or direction of shock. The indications as to\r\nintensity are vitiated by the fact that a long-continued gentle shaking\r\nmay overturn a column which would stand a very considerable sudden\r\nshock, while the directions in which a number of columns fall seldom\r\nagree owing to the rotational motion imparted to them by the shaking.\r\nBesides, the direction of motion of the earthquake seldom remains in\r\nthe same azimuth throughout the whole disturbance.\r\n\r\nAn extremely delicate, and at the same time simple form of seismoscope\r\nmay be made by propping up strips of glass, pins, or other easily\r\noverturned bodies against suitably placed supports. In this way bodies\r\nmay be arranged, which, although they can only fall in one direction,\r\nnevertheless fall with far less motion than is necessary to overturn\r\nany column which will stand without lateral support.\r\n\r\n_Projection Seismometers._—Closely related to the seismoscopes and\r\nseismometers which depend on the overturning of bodies. Mallet has\r\ndescribed two sets of apparatus whose indications depend on the\r\ndistance to which a body is projected. In one of these, which consisted\r\nof two similar parts arranged at right angles, two metal balls rest\r\none on each side of a stop at the lower part of two inclined \\/ like\r\ntroughs. In this position each of the balls completes an electric\r\ncircuit. By a shock the balls are projected or rolled up the troughs,\r\nand the height to which they rise is recorded by a corresponding\r\ninterval in the break of the circuits. The vertical component of the\r\nmotion is measured by the compression of a spring which carries the\r\ntable on which this arrangement rests. In the second apparatus two\r\nballs are successively projected, one by the forward swing, and the\r\nother by the backward swing of the shock. Attached to them are loose\r\nwires forming terminals of the circuits. They are caught in a bed\r\nof wet sand in a metal trough forming the other end of the circuit.\r\nThe throw of the balls as measured in the sand, and the difference\r\nof time between their successive projections as indicated by special\r\ncontrivances connected with the closing of the circuits, enables\r\nthe observer to calculate the direction of the wave of shock, its\r\nvelocity, and other elements connected with the disturbance. It will be\r\nobserved that the design of this apparatus assumes the earthquake to\r\nconsist of a distinct isolated shock.\r\n\r\nOldham, at the end of his account of the Cachar earthquake of 1869,\r\nrecommends the use of an instrument based on similar principles. In his\r\ninstrument four balls like bullets are placed in notches cut in the\r\ncorners of the upper end of a square stake driven into the ground.\r\n\r\n_Vessels filled with liquid._—Another form of simple seismoscope is\r\nmade by partially filling a vessel with liquid. The height to which the\r\nliquid is washed up the side of the vessel is taken as an indication of\r\nthe intensity of the shock, and the line joining the points on which\r\nmaximum motion is indicated, is taken as the direction of the shock. If\r\nearthquakes all lasted for the same length of time, and consisted of\r\nvibrations of the same period, such instruments might be of service.\r\nThese instruments have, however, been in use from an early date. In\r\n1742 we find that bowls of water were used to measure the earthquakes\r\nwhich in that year alarmed the inhabitants of Leghorn. About the same\r\ntime the Rev. S. Chandler, writing about the shock at Lisbon, tells us\r\nthat earthquakes may be measured by means of a spherical bowl about\r\nthree or four feet in diameter, the inside of which, after being dusted\r\nover with Barber’s puff, is filled very gently with water. Mallet,\r\nBabbage, and De la Bêche have recommended the same sort of contrivance,\r\nbut, notwithstanding, it has justly been criticised as ‘ridiculous and\r\nutterly impracticable.’[7]\r\n\r\nAn important portion of Palmieri’s well-known instrument consists\r\nof horizontal tubes turned up at the ends and partially filled with\r\nmercury. To magnify the motion of the mercury, small floats of iron\r\nrest on its surface. These are attached by means of threads to a pulley\r\nprovided with indices which move in front of a scale of degrees. We\r\nthus read off the intensity of an earthquake as so many degrees, which\r\nmeans so many millimetres of washing up and down of mercury in a tube.\r\nThe direction of movement is determined by the azimuth of the tube\r\nwhich gives the maximum indication, several tubes being placed in\r\ndifferent azimuths.\r\n\r\nThis form of instrument appears to have been suggested by Mallet, who\r\ngives an account of the same in 1846. Inasmuch as the rise and fall\r\nof the mercury in such tubes depend on its depth and on the period\r\nof the earthquake together with its duration, we see that although\r\nthe results obtained from a given instrument may give us means of\r\nmaking approximate comparisons as to the relative intensity of various\r\nearthquakes, it is very far from yielding any absolute measurement.\r\n\r\nAnother method which has been employed to magnify and register the\r\nmotions of liquid in a vessel has been to float upon its surface a\r\nraft or ship from which a tall mast projected. By a slight motion of\r\nthe raft, the top of the mast vibrated through a considerable range.\r\nThis motion of the mast as to direction and extent was then recorded by\r\nsuitable contrivances attached to the top of the mast.\r\n\r\nA very simple form of liquid seismoscope consists of a circular trough\r\nof wood with notches cut round its side. This is filled with mercury\r\nto the level of the notches. At the time of an earthquake the maximum\r\nquantity of mercury runs over the notches in the direction of greatest\r\nmotion. This instrument, which has long been used in Italy, is known as\r\na Cacciatore, being named after its inventor. It is a prominent feature\r\nin the collection of apparatus forming the well-known seismograph of\r\nPalmieri.\r\n\r\n_Pendulum instruments._—Mallet speaks of pendulum seismoscopes and\r\nseismographs as ‘the oldest probably of seismometers long set up in\r\nItaly and southern Europe.’ In 1841 we find these being used to record\r\nthe earthquake disturbances at Comrie in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThese instruments may be divided into two classes: first, those which\r\nat the time of the shock are intended to swing, and thus record the\r\ndirection of movement; and second, those which are supposed to remain\r\nat rest and thus provide ‘steady points.’\r\n\r\nTo obtain an absolutely ‘steady point’ at the time of an earthquake,\r\nhas been one of the chief aims of all recent seismological\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nWith a style or pointer projecting down from the steady point to\r\na surface which is being moved backward and forward by the earth,\r\nsuch a surface has written upon it by its own motions a record of\r\nthe ground to which it is attached. Conversely, a point projecting\r\nupwards from the moving earth might be caused to write a record on the\r\nbody providing the steady point, which in the class of instruments\r\nnow to be referred to is supposed to be the bob of a pendulum. It is\r\nnot difficult to get a pendulum which will swing at the time of a\r\nmoderately strong earthquake, but it is somewhat difficult to obtain\r\none which will not swing at such a time. During the past few years,\r\npendulums varying between forty feet in length and carrying bobs of\r\neighty pounds in weight, and one-eighth of an inch in length, and\r\ncarrying a gun-shot, have been experimented with under a great variety\r\nof circumstances. Sometimes the supports of these pendulums have been\r\nas rigid as it is possible to make a structure from brick and mortar,\r\nand at other times they have intentionally been made loose and\r\nflexible. The indices which wrote the motions of these pendulums have\r\nbeen as various as the pendulums themselves. A small needle sliding\r\nvertically through two small holes, and resting its lower end on a\r\nsurface of smoked glass, has on account of its small amount of friction\r\nbeen perhaps one of the favourite forms of recording pointers.\r\n\r\nThe free pendulums which have been employed, and which were intended\r\nto swing, have been used for two purposes: first, to determine the\r\ndirection of motion from the direction of swing, and second, to see if\r\nan approximation to the period of the earth’s motion could be obtained\r\nby discovering the pendulum amongst a series of different lengths which\r\nwas set in most violent motion, this probably being the one which had\r\nits natural period of swing the most nearly approximating to the period\r\nof the earthquake oscillations.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as all pendulums when swinging have a tendency to change the\r\nplane of their oscillation, and also as we now know that the direction\r\nof motion during an earthquake is not always constant, the results\r\nusually obtained with these instruments respecting the direction of\r\nthe earth’s motion have been unsatisfactory. The results which were\r\nobtained by series of pendulums of different lengths were, for various\r\nreasons, also unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nOf pendulums intended to provide a steady point, from which the\r\nrelative motion of a point on the earth’s surface could be recorded,\r\nthere has been a great variety. One of the oldest forms consisted of\r\na pendulum with a style projecting downwards from the bob so as to\r\ntouch a bed of sand. Sometimes a concave surface was placed beneath the\r\npendulum, on which the record was traced by means of a pencil. Probably\r\nthe best form was that in which a needle, capable of sliding freely up\r\nand down, marked the relative horizontal motion of the earth and the\r\npendulum bob on a smoked glass plate.\r\n\r\nIt generally happens that at the time of a moderately severe earthquake\r\nthe whole of these forms of apparatus are set in motion, due partly to\r\nthe motion of the point of support of the pendulum, and partly to the\r\nfriction of the writing point on the plate.\r\n\r\nAmong these pendulums may be mentioned those of Cavallieri, Faura,\r\nPalmieri, Rossi, and numerous others. It is possible that the\r\noriginators of some of these pendulums may have intended that\r\nthey should record by swinging. If this is so, then so far as the\r\ndetermination of the actual nature of earthquake motion is concerned,\r\nthey belong to a lower grade of apparatus than that in which they are\r\nhere included.\r\n\r\nA great improvement in pendulum apparatus is due to Mr. Thomas Gray\r\nof Glasgow, who suggested applying so much frictional resistance to\r\nthe free swing of a pendulum that for small displacements it became\r\n‘dead beat.’ By carrying out this suggestion, pendulum instruments\r\nwere raised to the position of seismographs. The manner of applying\r\nthe friction will be understood from the following description of a\r\npendulum instrument which is also provided with an index which gives a\r\nmagnification of the motion of the earth.\r\n\r\nB B B B is a box 113 cm. high and 30 cm. by 18 cm. square. Inside this\r\nbox a lead ring R, 17 cm. in diameter and 3 cm. thick, is suspended as\r\na pendulum from the screw S. This screw passes through a small brass\r\nplate P P, which can be moved horizontally over a hole in the top of\r\nthe box. These motions in the point of suspension allow the pendulum to\r\nbe adjusted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nProjecting over the top of the pendulum there is a wooden arm W\r\ncarrying two sliding pointers H H, resting on a glass plate placed on\r\nthe top of the pendulum. These pointers are for the purpose of giving\r\nthe frictional resistance before referred to. If this friction plate\r\nis smoked, the friction pointers will write upon it records of _large_\r\nearthquakes independently of the records given by the proper index,\r\nwhich only gives satisfactory records in the case of shocks of ordinary\r\nintensity. Crossing the inside of the pendulum R there is a brass bar\r\nperforated with a small conical hole at M. A stiff wire passes through\r\nM and forms the upper portion of the index I, the lower portion of\r\nwhich is a thin piece of bamboo. Fixed upon the wire there is a small\r\nbrass ball which rests on the upper side of a second brass plate also\r\nperforated with a conical hole, which plate is fixed on the bar O O\r\ncrossing the box.\r\n\r\nIf at the time of an earthquake the upper part of the index I remains\r\nsteady at M, then by the motion at O, the lower end of the index which\r\ncarries a sliding needle at G, will magnify the motion of the earth in\r\nthe ratios M O: O G. In this instrument O G is about 17 cm.\r\n\r\nThe needle G works upon a piece of smoked glass. In order to bring\r\nthe glass into contact with the needle without disturbance, the glass\r\nis carried on a strip of wood K, hinged at the back of the box, and\r\npropped up in front by a loose block of wood Y. When Y is removed\r\nthe glass drops down with K out of contact with the needle. The box\r\nis carried on bars of wood C C, which are fixed to the ground by the\r\nstakes A A.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of a pendulum seismograph working on a stationary\r\nplate is, that the record shows at once whether the direction of motion\r\nhas been constant, or whether it has been variable. The maximum extent\r\nof motion in various directions is also easily obtained.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of the instrument is, that at the time of a large\r\nearthquake, owing perhaps to a slight swing in the pendulum, the\r\nrecords may be unduly magnified.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions, however, fairly good records may be obtained from\r\nthe friction pointers, provided that the plates on which they work have\r\nbeen previously smoked. It might perhaps be well to use two of these\r\ninstruments, one having a comparatively high frictional resistance, and\r\nhence ‘dead beat’ for large displacements.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to use a pendulum seismograph in\r\nconjunction with a record-receiving surface, which at the time of the\r\nearthquake should be kept in motion by clockwork. In this way it was\r\nhoped to separate the various vibrations of the earthquake, and thus\r\navoid the greater or less confusion which occurs when the index of the\r\npendulum writes its backward and forward motion on a stationary plate.\r\nHitherto all attempts in this direction, in which a single multiplying\r\nindex was used, have been unsuccessful because of the moving plate\r\ndragging the index in the direction of its motion for a short\r\ndistance, and then allowing it to fall back towards its normal position.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject we may mention the pendulum\r\nseismographs of Kreil, Wagener, Ewing, and Gray.\r\n\r\nIn the bob of Kreil’s pendulum there was clockwork, which caused a disc\r\non the axis of the pendulum to continuously rotate. On this continually\r\nrevolving surface a style fixed to the earth traced an unbroken circle.\r\nAt the time of an earthquake, by the motion of the style, the circle\r\nwas to be broken and lines drawn. The number and length of these lines\r\nwere to indicate the length and intensity of the disturbance.\r\n\r\nGray’s pendulum consisted of a flat heavy disc carrying on its upper\r\nsurface a smoked glass plate. This, which formed the bob of the\r\npendulum, was supported by a pianoforte steel wire. When set ready to\r\nreceive an earthquake, the wire was twisted and the bob held by a catch\r\nso arranged that at the time of the earthquake the catch was released,\r\nand the bob of the pendulum allowed to turn slowly by the untwisting of\r\nthe supporting wire. Resting on the surface of this rotating disc were\r\ntwo multiplying indices arranged to write the earth’s motions as two\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\nIn the instruments of Wagener and Ewing, the clockwork and moving\r\nsurface do not form part of the pendulum, but rest independently on\r\na support rigidly attached to the earth. In Wagener’s instrument one\r\nindex only is used, while in Ewing’s two are used for writing the\r\nrecord of the motion.\r\n\r\nA difficulty which is apparent in all pendulum machines is that when\r\nthe bob of such a pendulum is deflected it tends to fall back to its\r\nnormal position. To make a pendulum perfect it therefore requires\r\nsome compensating arrangement, so that the pendulum, for small\r\ndisplacements, shall be in neutral equilibrium, and the errors due to\r\nswinging shall be avoided.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods have been suggested for making the bob of an ordinary\r\npendulum astatic for small displacements. One method proposed by Gray\r\nconsists in fixing in the bob of a pendulum a circular trough of\r\nliquid, the curvature of this trough having a proper form. Another\r\nmethod which was suggested, was to attach a vertical spiral spring\r\nto a point in the axis of the pendulum a little below the point of\r\nsuspension, and to a fixed point above it, so that when the pendulum is\r\ndeflected it would introduce a couple.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ewing has suggested an arrangement so that the bob of the\r\npendulum shall be partly suspended by a stretched spiral spring, and at\r\nthe same time shall be partly held up from below by a vertically placed\r\nstrut, the weight carried by the strut being to the weight carried by\r\nthe spring in the ratio of their respective lengths. As to how these\r\narrangements will act when carried into practice yet remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nAnother important class of instruments are _inverted pendulums_. These\r\nare vertical springs made of metal or wood loaded at their upper end\r\nwith a heavy mass of metal. An arrangement of this sort, provided at\r\nits upper end with a pencil to write on a concave surface, was employed\r\nin 1841 to register the earthquakes at Comrie in Scotland. In Japan\r\nthey were largely employed in series, each member of a series having\r\na different period of vibration. The object of these arrangements\r\nwas to determine which of the pendulums, with a given earthquake,\r\nrecorded the greatest motion, it being assumed that the one which was\r\nthrown into the most violent oscillation would be the one most nearly\r\napproximating with the period of the earthquake. The result of these\r\nexperiments showed that it was usually those with a slow period of\r\nvibration which were the most disturbed.\r\n\r\n_Bracket Seismographs._—A group of instruments of recent origin which\r\nhave done good work, are the bracket seismographs. These instruments\r\nappear to have been independently invented by several investigators:\r\nthe germ from which they originated probably being the well-known\r\nhorizontal pendulum of Professor Zöllner. In Japan they were first\r\nemployed by Professor W. S. Chaplin. Subsequently they were used by\r\nProfessor Ewing and Mr. Gray. They consist essentially of a heavy\r\nweight supported at the extremity of a horizontal bracket which is free\r\nto turn on a vertical axis at its other end. When the frame carrying\r\nthis axis is moved in any direction excepting parallel to the length\r\nof the gate-like bracket, the weight causes the bracket to turn round\r\na line known as the instantaneous axis of the bracket corresponding to\r\nthis motion of the fixed axis. Any point in this line may therefore be\r\ntaken as a steady point for motions at right angles to the length of\r\nthe supporting bracket. Two of these instruments placed at right angles\r\nto each other have to be employed in conjunction, and the motion of\r\nthe ground is written down as two rectangular components. In Professor\r\nEwing’s form of the instrument, light prolongations of the brackets\r\nform indices which give magnified representations of the motion, and\r\nthe weights are pivoted round a vertical axis through their centre.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying sketch B is a heavy weight pivoted at the end of\r\na small bracket C A K, which bracket is free to turn on a knife-edge,\r\nK, above, and a pivot A, below, in the stand S. At the time of an\r\nearthquake B remains steady, and the index P, forming a continuation\r\nof the bracket, magnifies the motion of the stand, in the ratio of\r\nA C : C N.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn an instrument called a double-bracket seismograph, invented by Mr.\r\nGray, we have two brackets hinged to each other, and one of them to a\r\nfixed frame. The planes of the two brackets are placed at right angles,\r\nso as to give to a heavy mass supported at the end of the outer bracket\r\ntwo degrees of horizontal freedom.\r\n\r\nIn all bracket machines, especially those which carry a pivoted weight,\r\nit is doubtful whether the weight provides a truly steady point\r\nrelatively to the plate on which the record is written for motion\r\nparallel to the direction of the arm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n_Parallel motion Instrument._—A machine which writes its record as\r\ntwo components, and which promises great stability, is one suggested\r\nby Professor C. D. West. Like the bracket machines it consists of\r\ntwo similar parts placed at right angles to each other, and is as\r\nfollows: A bar of iron A is suspended from both sides on pivots at C C\r\nby a system of light arms hinging with each other at the black dots,\r\nbetween the upper and lower parts of the rigid frame B C. The arms are\r\nof such a length that for small displacements parallel to the length\r\nof the bar, C C practically move in a straight line, and the bar is\r\nin neutral equilibrium. A light prolongation of the bar _d_ works the\r\nupper end of the light index _e_, passing as a universal joint through\r\nthe rigid support F. A second index _e′ _ from the bar at right angles\r\nalso passes through F. The multiplying ends of these indices are\r\ncoupled together to write a resultant motion on a smoked glass plate S.\r\n\r\n_Conical Pendulums._—Another group of instruments which have also\r\nyielded valuable records are the conical pendulum seismographs. The\r\nidea of using the bob of a conical pendulum to give a steady point in\r\nan earthquake machine was first suggested and carried into practice by\r\nMr. Gray. The seismograph as employed consists of a pair of conical\r\npendulums hung in planes at right angles to each other. The bob of each\r\nof these pendulums is fixed a short distance from the end of a light\r\nlever, which forms the writing index, the short end resting as a strut\r\nagainst the side of a post fixed in the earth. The weight is carried by\r\na thin wire or thread, the upper end of which is attached to a point\r\nvertically above the fixed end of the lever.\r\n\r\n_Rolling Spheres and Cylinders._—After the conical pendulum\r\nseismographs, which claim several important advantages over the bracket\r\nmachines, we come to a group of instruments known as rolling sphere\r\nseismographs. Here, again, we have a class of instruments for the\r\nvarious forms of which we are indebted to the ingenuity of Mr. Gray.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement and principle of one of these instruments will\r\nbe readily understood from the accompanying figure. S is a segment\r\nof a large sphere with a centre near C. Slightly below this centre a\r\nheavy weight B, which may be a lead ring, is pivoted. At the time of\r\nan earthquake C is steady, and the earth’s motions are magnified by\r\nthe pointer C A N in the proportion of C A : A N. The working of this\r\npointer or index is similar to that of the pointer in the pendulum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the rolling sphere seismographs, are Gray’s\r\nrolling cylinder seismographs.\r\n\r\nThese are two cylinders resting on a surface plate with their axes at\r\nright angles to each other. Near to the highest point in each of these\r\ncylinders, this point remaining nearly steady when the surface plate\r\nis moved backwards and forwards, there is attached the end of a light\r\nindex. These indices are again pivoted a short distance from their ends\r\non axes connected with the surface plate. In order that the two indices\r\nmay be brought parallel, one is cranked at the second pivot.\r\n\r\n_Ball and Plate Seismograph._—Another form of seismograph, which is\r\nclosely related to the two forms of apparatus just described, is\r\nVerbeck’s ball and plate seismograph. This consists of a surface plate\r\nresting on three hard spheres, which in turn rests upon a second\r\nsurface plate. When the lower plate is moved, the upper one tends to\r\nremain at rest, and thus may be used as a steady mass to move an index.\r\n\r\n_The Principle of Perry and Ayrton._—An instrument which is of interest\r\nfrom the scientific principle it involves is a seismograph suggested\r\nby Professors Perry and Ayrton, who propose to support a heavy ball on\r\nthree springs, which shall be sufficiently stiff to have an exceedingly\r\nquick period of vibration. By means of pencils attached to the ball by\r\nlevers, the motions of the ball are to be recorded on a moving band of\r\npaper. The result would be a record compounded of the small vibrations\r\nof the springs superimposed on the larger, slower, wave-like motions\r\nof the earthquake, and, knowing the former of these, the latter might\r\nbe separated by analysis. Although our present knowledge of earthquake\r\nmotion indicates that the analysis of such a record would often present\r\nus with insuperable difficulties, this instrument is worthy of notice\r\non account of the novelty of the principle it involves, which, the\r\nauthors truly remark, has in seismometry been a ‘neglected’ one.\r\n\r\n_Instruments to record Vertical Motion._—The instruments which have\r\nbeen devised to record vertical motion are almost as numerous as those\r\nwhich have been devised to record horizontal motion. The earliest\r\nform of instrument employed for this purpose was a spiral spring\r\nstretched by weight, which, on account of its inertia, was supposed\r\nat the time of a shock to remain steady. No satisfactory results have\r\never been obtained from such instruments, chiefly on account of the\r\ninconvenience in making a spring sufficiently long to allow of enough\r\nelongation to give a long period of vibration. Similar remarks may\r\nbe applied to the horizontally placed elastic rods, one end of which\r\nis fixed to a wall, whilst the opposite end is loaded with a weight.\r\nSuch contrivances, furnished with pencil on the weight to write a\r\nrecord upon a vertical surface, were used in 1842 at Comrie, and we\r\nsee the same principle applied in a portion of Palmieri’s apparatus.\r\nContrivances like these neither give us the true amplitude of the\r\nvertical motion, insomuch as they are readily set in a state of\r\noscillation; nor do they indicate the duration of a disturbance, for,\r\nbeing once set in motion, they continue that motion in virtue of their\r\ninertia long after the actual earthquake has ceased. They can only be\r\nregarded as seismoscopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory instrument which has yet been devised for\r\nrecording vertical motion is Gray’s horizontal lever spring seismograph.\r\n\r\nThis instrument will be better understood from the accompanying sketch.\r\nA vertical spring S is fixed at its upper end by means of a nut _n_,\r\nwhich rests on the top of the frame F, and serves to raise or lower\r\nthe spring through a short distance as a last adjustment for the\r\nposition of the cross-arm A. The arm A rests at one end on two sharp\r\npoints, _p_, one resting in a conical hole and the other in a V-slot;\r\nit is supported at B by the spring S, and is weighted at C with a lead\r\nring R. Over a pin at the point C a stirrup of thread is placed which\r\nsupports a small trough, _t_. The trough _t_ is pivoted at _a_, has\r\nattached to it the index _i_ (which is hinged by means of a strip of\r\ntough paper at _h_, and rests through a fine pin on the glass plate\r\n_g_), and is partly filled with mercury.\r\n\r\nAnother method of obtaining a steady point for vertical motion is that\r\nof Dr. Wagener, who employs a buoy partly immersed in a vessel of\r\nwater. This was considerably improved upon by Mr. Gray, who suggested\r\nthe use of a buoy, which, with the exception of a long thin style, was\r\ncompletely sunk.\r\n\r\nAmong the other forms of apparatus used to record vertical motion may\r\nbe mentioned vessels provided with india-rubber or other flexible\r\nbottoms, and partially filled with water or some other liquid. As the\r\nvessel is moved up and down, the bottom tends to remain behind and\r\nprovides a more or less steady point. Pivoted to this is a light index,\r\nwhich is again pivoted to a rigid frame in connection with the earth.\r\nInstruments of this description have yielded good records.\r\n\r\n_Record Receivers._—A large number of earthquake machines having been\r\nreferred to, it now remains to consider the apparatus on which they\r\nwrite their motions. The earlier forms of seismographs, as has already\r\nbeen indicated, recorded their movements in a bed of sand; others\r\nwrote their records by means of pencils on sheets of paper. Where we\r\nhave seismographs which magnify the motion of the earth, it will be\r\nobserved that methods like the above would involve great frictional\r\nresistances, tending to cause motion in the assumed steady points of\r\nthe seismographs. One of the most perfect instruments would be obtained\r\nby registering photographically the motions of the recording index by\r\nthe reflection of a ray of light. Such an instrument would, however,\r\nbe difficult to construct and difficult to manipulate. One of the best\r\npractical forms of registering apparatus is one in which the record is\r\nwritten on a surface of smoked glass. This can afterwards be covered\r\nwith a coat of photographer’s varnish, and subsequently photographed by\r\nthe ‘blue process’ so well known to engineers.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a record of all the vibrations of an earthquake it is\r\nnecessary that the surface on which the seismograph writes should at\r\nthe time of an earthquake be in motion. Of record-receiving machines\r\nthere are three types. First, there are those which move continuously.\r\nThe common form of these is a circular glass plate like an old form of\r\nchronograph, driven continuously by clockwork. On this the pointers of\r\nthe seismograph rest and trace over and over again the same circles.\r\nAt the time of an earthquake they move back and forth across the\r\ncircles, which are theoretically fine lines, and leave a record of\r\nthe earthquake. Instead of a circular plate, a drum covered with\r\nsmoked paper may be used, which, after the earthquake, possesses the\r\nadvantage, after unrolling, of presenting the record in a straight\r\nline, instead of a record written round the periphery of a circle, as\r\nis the case with the circular glass plates. Such records are easily\r\npreserved, but they are more difficult to photograph.\r\n\r\nThe second form of apparatus is one which is set in motion at the\r\ntime of a shock. This may be a contrivance like one of those just\r\ndescribed, or a straight smoked glass plate on a carriage. By means\r\nof an electrical or a mechanical contrivance called a ‘starter,’ of\r\nwhich many forms have been contrived, the earthquake is caused to\r\nrelease a detent and thus set in motion the mechanism which moves the\r\nrecord receiver.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of continuously-moving machines is that the\r\nbeginning and end of the shock can usually be got with certainty, while\r\nall the uncertainty as to the action of the ‘starter’ is avoided.\r\nSelf-starting machines have, of course, the advantage of simplicity and\r\ncheapness, while there is no danger of the record getting obliterated\r\nby the subsequent motion of the plate under the index.\r\n\r\n_Time-recording Apparatus._—Of equal importance with the instruments\r\nwhich record the motion of the ground, are those instruments which\r\nrecord the time at which such motion took place. The great value of\r\ntime records, when determining the origin from which an earthquake\r\noriginates, will be shown farther on. The most important result which\r\nis required in connection with time observations, is to determine\r\nthe interval of time taken by a disturbance in travelling from one\r\npoint to another. On account of the great velocity with which these\r\ndisturbances sometimes travel, it is necessary that these observations\r\nshould be made with considerable accuracy. The old methods of adapting\r\nan apparatus to a clock which, when shaken, shall cause the clock to\r\nstop, are of little value unless the stations at which the observations\r\nare made are at considerable distances apart. This will be appreciated\r\nwhen we remember that the disturbance may possibly travel at the rate\r\nof a mile per second, that its duration at any station may often extend\r\nover a minute, and that one set of apparatus at one station may stop,\r\nperhaps, at the commencement of the disturbance, and the other near\r\nthe end. A satisfactory time-taking apparatus will therefore require,\r\nnot only the means for stopping a clock, but also a contrivance which,\r\nat the same instant that the clock is stopped, shall make a mark on a\r\nrecord which is being drawn by a seismograph. In this way we find out\r\nat which portion of the shock the time was taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nPalmieri stops a clock in his seismograph by closing an electric\r\ncircuit. Mallet proposes to stop a clock by the falling of a column\r\nwhich is attached by a string to the pendulum of the clock. So long as\r\nthe column is standing the string is loose and the pendulum is free\r\nto move; but when the column falls, the string is tightened and the\r\npendulum is arrested. The difficulty which arises is to obtain a column\r\nthat will fall with a slight disturbance. The best form of contrivance\r\nfor causing a column to fall, and one which may also be used in drawing\r\nout a catch to relieve the machinery of a record receiver, is shown in\r\nthe accompanying sketch.\r\n\r\nS is the segment of a sphere about 4·5 cm. radius, with a centre\r\nslightly above C. L is a disc of lead about 7 cm. in diameter resting\r\nupon the segment. Above this there is a light pointer, P, about 30\r\ncm. long. On the top of the pointer a small cylinder of iron, W, is\r\nbalanced, and connected by a string with the catch to be relieved. When\r\nthe table on which W P S rests is shaken, rotation takes place near\r\nto C, the motion of the base S is magnified at the upper end of the\r\npointer, and the weight overturned. This catch may be used to relieve\r\na toothed bar axled at one end, and held up above a pin projecting\r\nfrom the face of the pendulum bob. When this falls it catches the\r\nprojecting pin and holds the pendulum.\r\n\r\nAnother way of relieving the toothed bar is to hold up the opposite\r\nend to that at which it is axled by resting it on the extremity of a\r\nhorizontal wire fixed to the bob of a conical pendulum—for example, one\r\nof the indices of a conical pendulum seismograph. The whole of this\r\napparatus, which may be constructed at the cost of a few pence, can be\r\nmade small enough to go inside an ordinary clock case.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty which arises with all these clock-stopping arrangements\r\nis that it is difficult for observers situated at distant stations\r\nto re-start their clocks so that their difference in time shall\r\nbe accurately known. Even if each observer is provided with a\r\nwell-regulated chronometer, with which he can make comparisons, the\r\nrating of these instruments is for all ordinary persons an extremely\r\ntroublesome operation.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid this difficulty the author has of late years used a\r\nmethod of obtaining the time without stopping the clock. To do this a\r\nclock with a central seconds hand is taken, and the hour and minute\r\nhands are prolonged and bent out slightly at their extremities at right\r\nangles to the face, the hour hand being slightly the longest. Each\r\nhand is then tipped with a piece of soft material like cork, which is\r\nsmeared with a glycerine ink. A light flat ring, with divisions in it\r\ncorresponding to those on the face of the clock, is so arranged that\r\nat the time of a shock it can be quickly advanced to touch the inked\r\npads on the hands of the clock and then withdrawn. This is accomplished\r\nby suitable machinery, which is relieved either by an electro-magnet\r\nor some other contrivance which will withdraw a catch. In this way an\r\nimpression in the form of three dots is received on the disc, and the\r\ntime known without either stopping or sensibly retarding the clock.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary observers, if a time-taker is not used in conjunction\r\nwith a record receiver, as good results as those obtained by ordinary\r\nclock-stopping apparatus are obtainable by glancing at an ordinary\r\nwatch. Subsequently the watch by which the observation was made should\r\nbe compared with some good time-keeper, and the local time at which the\r\nshock took place is then approximately known.\r\n\r\nFrom what has now been said it will be seen that for a complete\r\nseismograph we require three distinct sets of apparatus—an apparatus to\r\nrecord horizontal motion, an apparatus to record vertical motion, and\r\nan apparatus to record time. The horizontal and vertical motions must\r\nbe written on the same receiver, and if possible side by side, whilst\r\nthe instant at which the time record is made a mark must be made on\r\nthe edge of the diagram which is being drawn by the seismograph. Such\r\na seismograph has been constructed and is now erected in Japan. It is\r\nillustrated in the accompanying diagram.\r\n\r\n_The Gray and Milne Seismograph._—In this apparatus two mutually\r\nrectangular components of the horizontal motion of the earth are\r\nrecorded on a sheet of smoked paper wound round a drum, D, kept\r\ncontinuously in motion by clockwork, W, by means of two conical\r\npendulum seismographs, C. The vertical motion is recorded on the same\r\nsheet of paper by means of a compensated-spring seismograph, S L M B.\r\n\r\nThe time of occurrence of an earthquake is determined by causing the\r\ncircuit of two electro-magnets to be closed by the shaking. One of\r\nthese magnets relieves a mechanism, forming part of a time-keeper,\r\nwhich causes the dial of the timepiece to come suddenly forwards on\r\nthe hands and then move back to its original position. The hands are\r\nprovided with ink-pads, which mark their positions on the dial, thus\r\nindicating the hour, minute, and second when the circuit was closed.\r\nThe second electro-magnet causes a pointer to make a mark on the paper\r\nreceiving the record of the motion. This mark indicates the part of the\r\nearthquake at which the circuit was closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe duration of the earthquake is estimated from the length of the\r\nrecord on the smoked paper and the rate of motion of the drum. The\r\nnature and period of the different movements are obtained from the\r\ncurves drawn on the paper.\r\n\r\nMr. Gray has since greatly modified this apparatus, notably by the\r\nintroduction of a band of paper sufficiently long to take a record for\r\ntwenty-four hours without repetition. The record is written in ink by\r\nmeans of fine siphons. In this way the instrument, which is extremely\r\nsensitive to change of level, can be made to show not only earthquakes,\r\nbut the pulsations of long period which have recently occupied so much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n              EARTHQUAKE MOTION DISCUSSED THEORETICALLY.\r\n\r\n  Ideas of the ancients (the views of Travagini, Hooke, Woodward,\r\n    Stukeley, Mitchell, Young, Mallet)—Nature of elastic waves\r\n    and vibrations—Possible causes of disturbance in the Earth’s\r\n    crust—The time of vibration of an earth particle—Velocity and\r\n    acceleration of a particle—Propagation of a disturbance as\r\n    determined by experiments upon the elastic moduli of rocks—The\r\n    intensity of an earthquake—Area of greatest overturning\r\n    moment—Earthquake waves—Reflexion, refraction, and interference\r\n    of waves—Radiation of a disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ideas of Early Writers._—One of the first accounts of the varieties of\r\nmotion which may be experienced at the time of an earthquake is to be\r\nfound in the classification of earthquakes given by Aristotle.[8] It is\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n1. Epiclintæ, or earthquakes which move the ground obliquely.\r\n\r\n2. Brastæ, with an upward vertical motion like boiling water.\r\n\r\n3. Chasmatiæ, which cause the ground to sink and form hollows.\r\n\r\n4. Rhectæ, which raise the ground and make fissures.\r\n\r\n5. Ostæ, which overthrow with one thrust.\r\n\r\n6. Palmatiæ, which shake from side to side with a sort of tremor.\r\n\r\nFrom the sixth group in this classification we see that this early\r\nwriter did not regard earthquakes as necessarily isolated events, but\r\nthat some of them consisted of a succession of backward and forward\r\nvibratory motions. He also distinguishes between the total duration of\r\nan earthquake and the length of, and intervals between, a series of\r\nshocks. Aristotle had, in fact, some idea of what modern writers upon\r\nordinary earthquakes would term ‘modality.’\r\n\r\nThe earliest writer who had the idea that an earthquake was a\r\npulse-like motion propagated through solid ground appears to have been\r\nFrancisci Travagini, who, in 1679, wrote upon an earthquake which\r\nin 1667 had overthrown Ragusa. The method in which the pulses were\r\npropagated he illustrated by experiments.\r\n\r\nHooke, who, in 1690, delivered discourses on earthquakes before the\r\nRoyal Society, divides these phenomena according to the geological\r\neffects they have produced; thus there is a _genus_ producing\r\nelevations, a _genus_ producing sinkings, a _genus_ producing\r\nconversions and transportations, and a _genus_ which produces what, in\r\nmodern language, we should term metamorphic action.\r\n\r\nWoodward, in his ‘Natural History,’ written in 1695, speaks of\r\nearthquakes as being agitations and concussions produced by water in\r\nthe interior of the earth coming in contact with internal fires.\r\n\r\nStukeley observed that an earthquake was ‘a tremor of the earth,’ to\r\nbe explained as a vibration in a solid. The Rev. John Mitchell, writing\r\nin 1760, says that the motion of the earth in earthquakes is partly\r\ntremulous and partly propagated by waves.\r\n\r\nFrom these few examples, to which might be added many more, it will\r\nbe seen that an earthquake disturbance has usually been regarded as\r\na concussion, vibration, trembling, or undulatory movement. Further,\r\nit can be seen in narratives of earthquakes that it had been often\r\nobserved that these tremblings and shakings continued over a certain\r\nperiod of time. Although it had been noticed that large areas were\r\nalmost simultaneously affected by these disturbances, no definite idea\r\nappears to have existed as to how earthquake motion was propagated.\r\nUsually it was assumed that the disturbance spread through subterranean\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nThe first true conception of earthquake motion and the manner of its\r\npropagation is due to Dr. Thomas Young, who suggested that earthquake\r\nmotion was vibratory, and it might be ‘propagated through the earth\r\nnearly in the same manner as a noise is conveyed through the air.’ The\r\nsame idea was moulded into a more definite form by Gay Lussac.\r\n\r\nThe first accurate definition of an earthquake is due to Mr. Robert\r\nMallet, who, after collecting and examining many facts connected with\r\nearthquake phenomena, and reasoning on these, with the help of known\r\nlaws connected with the production and propagation of waves of various\r\ndescriptions, formulated his views as follows:—\r\n\r\nAn earthquake is ‘_the transit of a wave or waves of elastic\r\ncompression in any direction from vertically upwards to horizontally,\r\nin any azimuth, through the crust and surface of the earth, from any\r\ncentre of impulse or from more than one, and which may be attended\r\nwith sound and tidal waves, dependent upon the impulse and upon\r\ncircumstances of position as to sea and land_.’\r\n\r\nIn brief, so far as motion in the earth is concerned. Mallet defined\r\nan earthquake as being a motion due to the transit of waves of elastic\r\ncompression. In many cases it is possible that this is strictly true,\r\nbut in succeeding pages it will be shown that earthquake motion may\r\nalso be due to the transit of waves of elastic distortion.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a true idea of earthquake motion is a matter of cardinal\r\nimportance, as it forms the key-stone of many investigations.\r\n\r\nIf we know the nature of the motion produced by an earthquake, we are\r\naided in tracking it to its origin, and in reasoning as to how it was\r\nproduced. If our knowledge of the nature of the motion of an earthquake\r\nis incorrect, it will be impossible for us intelligently to construct\r\nbuildings to withstand the effects of these disturbances. We have thus\r\nto consider, in this portion of seismology, a point of great scientific\r\nimportance, and shall deal with it at some length.\r\n\r\n_Nature of Elastic Waves and Vibrations._—When it is stated that an\r\nearthquake consists of elastic waves of compression and distortion, the\r\nstudent of physics has a clear idea of what is meant and a knowledge\r\nof the mechanical laws which govern such disturbances. The ordinary\r\nreader, however, and the majority of the inhabitants of earthquake\r\ncountries, who of all people have the greatest interest in this matter,\r\nmay not have so clear a conception, and it will, therefore, not be out\r\nof place to give some general explanation on this point.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary idea of a wave is that it is a disturbance similar to\r\nthat which we often see in water. Waves like these must not, however,\r\nbe confounded with elastic waves. A disturbance produced in water,\r\nsay, for instance, by dropping a stone into a pond, is propagated\r\noutwards by the action of gravity. First, a ridge of water is raised\r\nup by the stone passing beneath the surface. As this ridge falls\r\ntowards its normal position in virtue of its weight, it raises a second\r\nridge. This second ridge raises a third ridge, and so on. The water\r\nmoves vertically up and down, whilst the wave itself is propagated\r\nhorizontally.\r\n\r\nTo understand what is meant by elastic waves, it is first necessary\r\nto understand what is meant by the term elastic. In popular language\r\nthe term elastic is confined to substances like india-rubber, and but\r\nseldom to rock-like materials, through which earthquake waves are\r\npropagated. India-rubber is called elastic because after we remove a\r\ncompressive force it has a tendency to spring back to its original\r\nshape. The elastic force of the india-rubber is in this case the force\r\nwhich causes it to resist a change of form. Now, a piece of rock may,\r\nup to a certain point, like the india-rubber, be compressed, and when\r\nthe compressing force is removed it will also tend to resume its\r\noriginal form. However, as the rock offers more resistance to the\r\ncompressing force than the india-rubber offers, we say that it is the\r\nmore elastic. It may be here observed that a substance like granite\r\noffers great resistance, not only to compression or a change of volume,\r\nbut also to a change of form or shape; whereas a substance like air,\r\nwhich is also elastic, only offers resistance to compression, but not\r\nto a change of shape.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas before us we will now proceed to consider how, after\r\na body has been suddenly compressed or distorted, this disturbance\r\nis propagated through the mass. For the elastic body let us take a\r\nlong spiral spring hung from the ceiling of a room and kept slightly\r\nstretched by a weight. If we give this weight an upward tap from below,\r\nsay with a hammer, we shall observe a pulse-like wave which runs up the\r\nspring until it reaches the ceiling of the room. Here it will, so to\r\nspeak, rebound, like a billiard ball from the end of a table, and run\r\ntowards the weight from which it started. Whilst this is going on we\r\nmay also observe that the weight is moving up and down.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have two distinct things to observe—one being the\r\ntransmission of motion up to the ceiling, which we may liken to the\r\ntransmission of an earthquake wave between two distant localities on\r\nthe earth’s surface, and the other being the up and down motion of our\r\nweight, which we may compare to the backward and forward swinging which\r\nwe experience at the time of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThese two motions—namely, the pulse-like wave produced by the\r\ntransmission of motion, and the backward and forward oscillation of the\r\nweight or of any point on the spring—must be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom each other.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will consider the backward and forward motion of the weight.\r\nThe distance through which the weight moves depends upon the force\r\nof the blow. The number of up and down oscillations it makes, say\r\nin a second, depends upon the stiffness of the spring. The weight,\r\nsupposing it to be always the same, will move more quickly at the end\r\nof a stiff spring than at the end of a flaccid one; that is to say, its\r\nvelocity is quicker. As in any given spring the number of up and down\r\noscillations are always the same in a given interval of time, if these\r\noscillations are of great extent, the weight must move more quickly\r\nwith large than with small oscillations.\r\n\r\nAt the time of an earthquake the manner in which we are moved backward\r\nand forward is very similar to the manner in which the weight is moved.\r\nIf we stand on a hard rock-like granite, we are to a great extent\r\nplaced as if we were attached to a stiff quickly-vibrating spring.\r\nIf, however, we are on a soft rock, it is more like being on a loose\r\nflaccid spring.\r\n\r\nAll that has thus far been considered has been a backward and forward\r\nkind of motion, where there is a rectilinear _compression_ and\r\n_extension_ amongst the particles on which we stand.\r\n\r\nWe might, however, imagine our rock, which for the moment we will\r\nconsider to be a square column, to be twisted, and thus have its\r\n_shape_ altered. When the twisting force is taken off it seems evident\r\nthat the column would endeavour to untwist itself or regain its\r\noriginal form. Now the force which a body offers against a change of\r\n_volume_ may be very different from that which it offers against a\r\nchange of _form_.\r\n\r\nIn disturbances which take place in the rocky crust of our earth,\r\nit would seem possible that we may have vibrations set up which are\r\neither compressions and extensions or twistings and distortions. These\r\nmay take place separately or simultaneously, or we may have resultant\r\nmotions due to their combination.\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of possible causes which might give rise to\r\nthese different orders of disturbance:—\r\n\r\n1. Imagine a large area stretched by elevation until it reaches the\r\nlimit of its elasticity and cracks. After cracking, in consequence\r\nof its elasticity, it will fly back over the whole area like a\r\nbroken spring, and each point in the area will oscillate round its\r\nnew position of equilibrium. In this case there will be no waves\r\nof distortion excepting near the end of the crack, where waves are\r\ntransmitted in a direction parallel to the fissure.\r\n\r\n2. The ground is broken and slips either up, down, or sideways, as\r\nwe see to have taken place in the production of faults. Here we get\r\ndistortion in the direction of the movement, and waves are produced\r\nby the elastic force of the rock, causing it to spring back from its\r\ndistorted form. In a case like this the production of a fissure running\r\nnorth and south might give rise to north and south vibrations, which\r\nwould be propagated end on towards the north and south, but broadside\r\non towards the east and west. With disturbances of this kind, on\r\naccount of the want of homogeneousness in the materials in which\r\nthey are produced, we should expect to find waves of compression and\r\nextension.\r\n\r\n3. A truly spherical cavity is suddenly formed by the explosion of\r\nsteam in the midst of an elastic medium. In this case all the waves\r\nwill be those of compression, each particle moving backward and forward\r\nalong a radius.\r\n\r\nShould the cavity, instead of being truly spherical, be irregular, it\r\nis evident that, in addition to the normal vibration of compression,\r\ntransverse waves of distortion will be more or less pronounced,\r\ndepending upon the nature of the cavity.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these two sets of vibrations may cause a point in\r\nthe earth to move in a circle, an ellipse, the form of a figure eight,\r\nand in other curves similar to these, which are produced by apparatus\r\ndesigned to show the combination of harmonic motion. From these\r\nexamples it will be seen that we have therefore to consider two kinds\r\nof vibrations—one produced by compression or the alteration of volume,\r\nand the other produced by an alteration in shape.\r\n\r\nNow the resistance which a body offers, either to a change in its\r\nvolume or in its shape, is called its elasticity, and the law which\r\ngoverns the backward and forward motion of a particle under the\r\ninfluence of this elasticity may be expressed as follows:\r\n\r\nIf T be the time of vibration, or the time taken by a particle to make\r\none complete backward and forward swing, D the density of the material\r\nof which this particle forms a part, and E the proper modulus of\r\nelasticity of the material, then,\r\n\r\n                                  _____\r\n                          T = 2π √ D/E\r\n\r\n                           _____\r\nFrom this formula, T = 2π √ D/E, we see that the time of\r\nvibration of the earth during an earthquake, or the rate at which we\r\nare shaken backwards and forwards, varies directly as the square root\r\nof the density of the material on which we stand, and inversely as the\r\nsquare root of a number proportional to its elasticity.\r\n\r\n_Velocity and Acceleration of an Earth Particle._—Another important\r\npoint, which the practical seismologist has often brought to his\r\nnotice, is the question of the velocity with which an earth particle\r\n                                         _____\r\nmoves. According to the formula, T = 2π √ D/E, we should expect\r\nthat a particle would make each semi-vibration in an equal time, and\r\nfrom a knowledge of the density and elastic moduli of a body this\r\ntime might be calculated. Although the time of a semi-oscillation may\r\nbe constant, we must bear in mind that, like the bob of a pendulum\r\nduring each of its swings, the particle starts from rest, increases in\r\nvelocity until it reaches the middle portion of its half swing, from\r\nwhich it gradually decreases in speed until it reaches zero, when it\r\nagain commences a similar motion in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThese pendulum-like vibrations are sometimes spoken of as simple\r\nharmonic motions. If we know the distance through which an earthquake\r\nmoves in making a single swing, and the time taken in making this\r\nswing, on the assumption that the motion is simple harmonic we can\r\neasily calculate the maximum velocity with which the particle moves.\r\n\r\nThus, if an earth particle takes one second to complete a\r\nsemi-oscillation, half of which, or the amplitude of the motion, equals\r\n_a_, the maximum velocity equals π × _a_.\r\n\r\nAgain, assuming the earth vibrations to be simple harmonic, the maximum\r\nacceleration or rate of change in velocity will come about at the ends\r\nof each semi-oscillation; and if V be the maximum velocity of\r\nthe particle, and _a_ the amplitude or half semi-oscillation, then the\r\n                            V^2\r\nmaximum acceleration equals ———.\r\n                            _a_\r\n\r\nLater on it will be shown, as the result of experiment, that certain of\r\nthe more important earth oscillations in an earthquake are not simple\r\nharmonic motion. Nevertheless the above remarks will be of assistance\r\nin showing how the velocity and other elements connected with the\r\nmotion of an earth particle, which are required by the practical\r\nseismologist, may be calculated, irrespective of assumptions as to the\r\nnature of the motion.\r\n\r\n_Propagation of a Disturbance._—We may next consider the manner in\r\nwhich a disturbance, in which there are both vibrations of compression\r\nand of distortion, is propagated. The first or normal set of vibrations\r\nare propagated in a manner similar to that in which sound vibrations\r\nare propagated. From a centre of disturbance these movements approach\r\nan observer at a distant station, so to speak, end on. The other\r\nvibrations have a direction of motion similar to that which we believe\r\nto exist in a ray of light. These would approach the observer broadside\r\non.\r\n\r\nIf the disturbance passed through a formation like a series of\r\nperfectly laminated slates, each of these two sets of vibration might\r\nbe subdivided, and we should then obtain what Mallet has termed\r\nordinary and extraordinary normal and transverse vibrations.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the difference in the elastic forces on which the\r\npropagation of these two kinds of vibration depends, the normal\r\nvibrations are transmitted faster than the transversal ones—that is\r\nto say, if an earthquake originated from a blow, the first thing that\r\nwould be felt at a point distant from the origin of the shock would be\r\na backward and forward motion in the direction to and from the origin,\r\nand then, a short interval afterwards, a motion transversal, or at\r\nright angles to this, would be experienced.\r\n\r\nFrom the mathematical theory of vibratory motions it is possible to\r\ncalculate the velocity with which a disturbance is propagated. As the\r\nresult of these investigations it has been shown that normal vibrations\r\ntravel more quickly than transverse vibrations.\r\n\r\nDeductions from experiments on small specimens are, however,\r\ninvalidated by the fact that the specimens used for experiments are,\r\nof course, nearly homogeneous, whilst the earthquake passes through\r\na mass which is heterogeneous and more or less fissured. Mallet, by\r\nexperiments ‘on the compressibility of solid cubes of these rocks,\r\nobtained the mean modulus of elasticity,’ with the result that ‘nearly\r\nseven-eighths of the full velocity of wave-transit due to the material,\r\nif solid and continuous, is lost by reason of the heterogeneity and\r\ndiscontinuity of the rocky masses as they are found piled together in\r\nnature.’ The full velocities of wave-transit, as calculated by Mallet\r\nfrom a theorem given by Poisson, were—\r\n\r\n  For slate and quartz transverse to lamination, 9,691 feet per second.\r\n        „         „    in line of lamination,    5,415  „         „\r\n\r\nThis more rapid transmission in a direction transverse to the\r\nlamination, Mr. Mallet observes, may be more than counterbalanced by\r\nthe discontinuity of the mass transverse to the same direction.\r\n\r\n_The Intensity of an Earthquake._—The intensity of an earthquake\r\nis best estimated by the intensity of the forces which are brought\r\nto bear on bodies placed on the earth’s surface. These forces are\r\nevidently proportional to the rate of change of velocity in the body,\r\nand, as the destructive effect will be proportional to the maximum\r\nforces, we may consistently indicate the intensity of an earthquake by\r\ngiving the maximum acceleration to which bodies were subject during\r\nthe disturbance. On the assumption that the motion of a point on\r\nthe earth’s surface is simple harmonic, the maximum acceleration is\r\ndirectly as the maximum velocity and inversely as the amplitude of\r\n              _v_^2\r\nmotion, or as ————— where _v_ indicates velocity and _a_ amplitude.\r\n               _a_\r\n\r\nThe next question of importance is to determine the manner in which\r\nearthquake energy becomes dissipated—that is, to compare together\r\nthe intensity of an earthquake as recorded at two or more points at\r\ndifferent distances from the origin. First let us imagine the origin\r\nof our earthquake to be surrounded by concentric shells, each of\r\nwhich is the breadth of the vibration of a particle. Going outwards\r\nfrom the centre, each successive shell will contain a greater number\r\nof particles, this number increasing directly as the square of the\r\ndistance from the origin. Let the blow have its origin at the centre,\r\nand give a vibratory movement to the particles in one of the shells\r\nnear the centre.\r\n\r\nThis shell may be supposed to possess a certain amount of energy,\r\nwhich will be measured by its mass and the square of the velocity of\r\nits particles. In transferring this energy to the neighbouring shell\r\nwhich surrounds it, because it has to set in motion a greater number\r\nof particles than it contains itself, the energy in any one particle\r\nof the second layer will be less than the energy in any one particle\r\nin the first layer; the total energy in the second shell, however,\r\nwill be equal to the total energy in the first shell. Neglecting the\r\nenergy lost during the transfer, if the energy in a particle of the\r\nfirst shell at any particular phase of the motion be K_{1},\r\nand the energy in a particle of the second shell K_{2}, these\r\nquantities are to each other inversely as the masses of the shells—that\r\nis, inversely as the squares of the mean radii of the shells.\r\n\r\n                  K_{2}   _r__{1}^2\r\n  In symbols,     ————— = —————————                   (1)\r\n                  K_{1}   _r__{2}^2\r\n\r\nAssuming that energy is dissipated,\r\n\r\n              K_{2}   _r__{1}^2       _r__{1}^2\r\n              ————— > ————————— = _f_ —————————       (2)\r\n              K_{1}   _r__{2}^2       _r__{2}^2\r\n\r\nwhere _f_ < 1 is the rate of dissipation of energy which is assumed to\r\nbe constant.\r\n\r\n_Area of greatest Overturning Moment._—Although the rate of dissipation\r\nof the impulsive effects of an earthquake may follow a law like that\r\njust enumerated, it must be remembered that if the depth of the origin\r\nis comparable with the radius of the area which is shaken, the maximum\r\nimpulsive effect as exhibited by the actual destruction on the surface\r\nmay not be immediately above the origin where buildings have simply\r\nbeen lifted vertically up and down, but at some distance from this\r\npoint, where the impulsive effort has been more oblique.\r\n\r\nAt the _epicentrum_ we have the maximum of the true intensity as\r\nmeasured by the acceleration of a particle, or the height to which\r\na body might be projected, but it will be at some distance from\r\nthis where we shall have the maximum intensity as exhibited by an\r\noverturning effort.\r\n\r\nThis will be rendered clear by the following diagram.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying diagram let O be the origin of a shock, and O C the\r\nseismic vertical equal to _r_. Let the direct or normal shock emerge at\r\nC, C_{1}, C_{2}, and at the angles θ_{1}, θ_{2}, &c.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the displacement of an earth particle at C equals C\r\nB, and at C_{1} equals _c__{1} _b__{1}, and at C_{2} equals _c__{2}\r\n_b__{2}, &c., and let these displacements C B, _c__{1} _b__{1}, _c__{2}\r\n_b__{2}, &c., for the sake of argument, vary inversely as _r_, _r__{1},\r\n_r__{2}, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe question is to determine where the horizontal component C A of\r\nthese normal motions is a maximum.\r\n\r\nFirst observe that the triangle O C _c_ is similar to _a_, _b_, _c_.\r\n\r\n            _h_\r\nAlso _r_ = —————, and therefore the normal component _c__{1}\r\n           sin θ\r\n\r\n                               sin θ\r\n_b__{1} at C_{1} is equal to C —————.\r\n                                _h_\r\n\r\nAlso _c__{1} _a__{1} = _c__{1} _b__{1}, cos θ.\r\n\r\n                       sin θ cos θ    _c_    sin 2θ\r\n      ∴ C_{1} _a_ = C ———————————— = ———— ∙ ———————,\r\n                          _h_         _h_      2\r\n\r\nand sin 2θ is greatest when 2θ = 90° or θ = 45°.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the horizontal component reaches a maximum where the\r\nangle of emergence equals 45°.\r\n\r\nThis question has been discussed on the assumption that the amplitude\r\nof an earth particle varies inversely as its distance from the origin\r\nof the shock. Should we, however, assume that this amplitude varies\r\ninversely as the square of the distance from the origin, we are led to\r\nthe result that the area of greatest disturbance is nearer to the point\r\nwhere the angle of emergence is 55° 44′  9″. Both of these methods are\r\nreferred to by Mallet, but the first is considered as probably the more\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n_Earthquake Waves._—Hitherto we have chiefly considered earthquake\r\nvibrations; now we will say a few words about earthquake waves. If\r\nwe strike a long iron rod at one end, we can imagine that, as in the\r\nlong spring, a pulse-like motion is transmitted. If the rod be struck\r\nquickly, the pulses will rapidly succeed each other, and if struck\r\nslowly the pulses will be at longer intervals. Each individual pulse,\r\nhowever, will travel along the rod at the same rate, and hence the\r\ndistance between any two will remain constant; but that distance will\r\ndepend on the interval between the blows producing these pulses being\r\nequal to the distance travelled by one pulse before the next blow is\r\nstruck.\r\n\r\nFrom this we see that an irregular disturbance will produce an\r\nirregular succession of motions; some will be like long undulations in\r\na wide deep ocean, whilst others will be like ripples in a shallow bay.\r\nAgain, consider the bar to be struck one blow only, and then left to\r\nitself. The bar will propagate a series of pulses along its length, due\r\nto the out and in vibration of its end. These will succeed each other\r\nat regular intervals, and will be mixed up with the pulses we have\r\npreviously considered.\r\n\r\nFrom this we see that in an earthquake, if it be produced by one blow,\r\nthe motion will be isochronous in its character; but if it be due to\r\na succession of blows at regular intervals, the motion will be the\r\nresultant of a series of isochronous motions, and will be periodical.\r\nIf the impulses are irregular, you have a motion which is the resultant\r\nof a number of isochronous motions due to each impulse, but these\r\ncompounded together in a different manner at each instant during the\r\nearthquake, and giving as a result a motion which is in no sense\r\nisochronous. This approaches more nearly to the actual motions we feel\r\nas earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIf we can imagine the ground shaken by an earthquake, made of a\r\ntransparent material which transmitted less light when compressed,\r\nand we could look down upon a long extent of this at the time of an\r\nearthquake, we should see a series of dark bands indicating strips of\r\ncountry which were compressed. The distances between these bands might\r\nbe irregular. Keeping our attention on one particular band, this would\r\nbe seen to travel forward in a direction from the source. If we kept\r\nour eye on one particular point, it would appear to open and shut,\r\nbecoming light and dark alternately.\r\n\r\nAs to the existence of these elastic waves in actual earthquakes we\r\nhave no direct experimental evidence. The only kind of wave with which\r\nwe are familiar is a true surface undulation, which, although having\r\nthe appearance of a water-wave, may nevertheless represent a district\r\nof compression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n             EARTHQUAKE MOTION AS DEDUCED FROM EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\n  Experiments with falling weights—Experiments with\r\n    explosives—Results obtained from experiments—Relative motion\r\n    of two adjacent points—The effect of hills and excavations\r\n    upon the propagation of vibrations—The intensity of artificial\r\n    disturbances—Velocity with which earth vibrations are\r\n    propagated—Experiments of Mallet—Experiments of Abbot—Experiments\r\n    in Japan—Mallet’s results—Abbot’s results—Results obtained in\r\n    Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiments with Falling Weights._—A series of experiments, as the\r\nnature of the disturbance produced in the surface of the earth when\r\na heavy weight is allowed to fall on it, was begun in November 1880\r\nby Mr. T. Gray and the author. These experiments were carried out at\r\nthe Akabane Engineering Works in Tokio. The weight used was a ball\r\nof iron weighing about a ton, which in the different experiments was\r\nallowed to fall from heights varying between ten and thirty-five feet.\r\nThe position of the place where the ball was allowed to fall was such\r\nthat in one direction the vibrations were transmitted up the side of\r\na steep hill, in another direction across a pond with perpendicular\r\nsides, and in another direction across a level plain the material of\r\nwhich consisted for the most part of hardened mud extending to a very\r\nconsiderable depth. The vibrations produced by the fall of the ball\r\nwere transmitted through this hard mud with considerable intensity to a\r\ndistance of between 300 and 400 feet.\r\n\r\nThe object of the experiment was to find the nature of the vibrations\r\nproduced in the crust of the earth by such a blow, the velocity of\r\ntransmission through this comparatively soft material, the effect of\r\nhills and excavations in cutting off such disturbances, and the law\r\naccording to which the amplitude of the vibrations diminishes with the\r\ndistance from the source.\r\n\r\nA considerable variety of apparatus was used during these experiments,\r\nbut the most reliable results were obtained from the records of a\r\nrolling sphere seismograph, which wrote the vibrations on a stationary\r\nplate, and from the records of two bracket seismographs, similar to\r\nProfessor Ewing’s horizontal lever seismographs, which gave a record\r\nof the vibrations as two rectangular components on a moving plate of\r\nsmoked glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe general result as to the nature of the disturbance was that two\r\ndistinct sets of vibrations were set up by the blow. In one set the\r\ndirection of motion was along a line joining the point of observation\r\nwith the point from which the disturbance emanated; in the other set\r\nthe direction of motion was at right angles to that line. The nature\r\nof the resultant motion will be gathered from fig. 10, which is taken\r\nfrom the records drawn by the rolling sphere seismograph at a distance\r\nof 50 feet, 100 feet, and 200 feet respectively from the point where\r\nthe ball struck the ground. The direct or normal vibrations reached\r\nthe instrument first, and were followed at an interval depending on\r\nthe distance of the instrument from the origin by the transverse\r\nvibrations. From the records of these two sets of vibrations as\r\nseparated by the bracket seismographs, combined with the known rate of\r\nmotion of the glass plate, the velocity of transmission was found to\r\nbe, for normal vibrations 446–438 feet per second, and for transverse\r\nvibrations 357–353 feet per second.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the hill in cutting off the disturbance seemed to be\r\nslight, but the direction of the vibrations which ascended the side\r\nwas mostly transverse. The pond, on the other hand, seemed completely\r\nto cut off the disturbance, which, however, gradually crept round the\r\nside, so that only a comparatively small triangular area was in shadow.\r\n\r\nThe amplitude of the vibrations diminished directly as the distance\r\nincreased for some distance from the origin, but at greater distance\r\nthe rate of diminution seemed to be slower. The transverse vibration\r\nseemed to die out less quickly than the normal vibrations.[9]\r\n\r\nThese experiments were afterwards very considerably extended by the\r\nauthor. In these later experiments charges of from one to two pounds of\r\ndynamite were placed in bore-holes of various depths and exploded by\r\nmeans of electricity. The results obtained confirmed the conclusions\r\nalready arrived at from the former experiments. The experiments on\r\nvelocity, however, seemed to indicate that the higher the initial\r\nimpulse the greater was the velocity. The velocity of propagation of\r\nthe transverse vibrations seemed to approach more and more to that of\r\nthe directed vibrations as the distance from the origin of disturbance\r\nincreased. Fig. 11 shows the nature of the record obtained from the\r\nexplosion of two pounds of dynamite at the bottom of a bore-hole eight\r\nfeet deep. These records show the interval of time which elapsed\r\nbetween the arrival of the normal and the transverse vibrations at\r\npoints distant 100, 250, and 400 feet from the bore-hole. In the case\r\nof the 100-feet station it will be observed that the motion towards the\r\norigin is greater than that from the origin. It is also to be noticed\r\nthat the period of vibration becomes greater as the distance from the\r\norigin increases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Records obtained at three stations\r\nof the motion of the ground produced by the explosion of 2 lbs. of\r\ndynamite.]\r\n\r\n_The Intensity of Artificial Disturbances._—The data which we have at\r\nour disposal for determining the intensity of an earth particle which\r\nhas been caused to vibrate by the explosion of a charge of dynamite are\r\na series of records similar to that given on p. 60. These disturbances\r\nare practically surface movements, and may be compared with the\r\nmovements of an earthquake which spreads over an area the radius of\r\nwhich is great as compared with its depth.\r\n\r\nTo find the mean acceleration of an earth particle, which quantity\r\nhas been taken to represent intensity, during any simple backward or\r\nforward motion of the earth, it will be first necessary to determine\r\nthe amplitude of this motion and its maximum velocity, the mean\r\n                            V^2\r\nacceleration being equal to ———.\r\n                            2A\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe second and third movements in a shock invariably exhibited the\r\ngreatest intensity, and to a distance of 400 feet from the origin,\r\nwhere about three pounds of dynamite had been exploded in a bore-hole\r\nabout six feet deep, these intensities decreased directly as the\r\ndistance from the origin. The less intense movements also decreased\r\ndirectly as the distance from the origin to a certain point, but after\r\nthat they decreased more slowly. A mean result of the more prominent\r\nvibrations in four sets of experiments is shown in the curve, fig. 12,\r\nwhere the horizontal measurements represent distance from the origin\r\nin feet, and the vertical measurements mean acceleration in thousands\r\nof millimetres per second.\r\n\r\nThis curve approximates to an equi-angular hyperbola. The area between\r\nthe curve and its asymptotes is proportional to the whole energy of\r\nthe shock. The area of the diagram is proportional to the energy given\r\nup to the ground by the explosion of three pounds of dynamite. If we\r\ncall the unit shock the effect produced by the explosion of one pound\r\nof dynamite, the above artificial earthquake had an intensity equal to\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nThe only other investigations which have been made in this interesting\r\nbranch of observational seismology are those by Mr. Robert Mallet,[10]\r\nand those by General Henry L. Abbot.[11]\r\n\r\n_Mallet’s Results._—The velocity with which earth vibrations were\r\ntransmitted as deduced by Mr. Mallet were as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                                  Feet per second\r\n  In sand                                              824·915\r\n  In contorted stratified rock, quartz, and slate\r\n      at Holyhead                                    1,088·669\r\n  In discontinuous and much shattered granite        1,306·425\r\n  In more solid granite                              1,664·574\r\n\r\nA striking result which was obtained by Mallet in his experiments at\r\nHolyhead was that the transit velocity increases with an increase in\r\nthe intensity of the initial shock. Thus with a charge of 12,000 pounds\r\nof powder the transit rate was 1,373 feet per second, whilst with 2,100\r\npounds the transit rate was 1,099 feet per second. In these experiments\r\ntremors were observed as preceding and following the main shock.\r\n\r\n_Abbot’s Results._—The important results obtained by General Abbot are\r\ncontained in the following table:—\r\n\r\n  A.

However, he also tells us\r\nthat a still higher power above 12 might have detected still earlier\r\ntremors.\r\n\r\nWhen gunpowder was the explosive, the observers noted that the\r\ndisturbance observed in the mercury took a much longer time to reach a\r\nmaximum than it did when dynamite was employed.\r\n\r\nIt was also observed that explosions fired beneath deep water gave\r\na higher velocity than similar explosions which took place beneath\r\nshallow water. In the latter case much of the energy was probably\r\nexpended in throwing a jet of water into the air.\r\n\r\nAnother point which was observed appears to have been that the rate\r\nvaried with the initial shock. Thus:—\r\n\r\n                                         Feet per second\r\n  400 lbs. of dynamite  gave                  8,814\r\n  200  „         „                            8,730\r\n   70  „       powder (deep) gave             8,415\r\n\r\nAlso it is probable that the rate of a wave diminished with its\r\nadvance. For,\r\n\r\n                                           Feet per second\r\n    200 lbs. of dynamite gave for 1  mile      8,730\r\n     „   „         „      „       5  miles     5,250\r\n  50,000 „         „      „       8    „       8,300\r\n    „    „         „      „      13½   „       5,300\r\n\r\nGeneral Abbot’s general conclusions are:—\r\n\r\n1. A high magnifying power of telescope is essential in seismometric\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n2. The more violent the initial shock the higher is the velocity of\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\n3. This velocity diminishes as the general wave advances.\r\n\r\n4. The movements of the earth’s crust are complex, consisting of many\r\nshort waves first, increasing and then decreasing in amplitude; and\r\nwith a detonating explosive the interval between the first wave and\r\nthe maximum wave, at any station, is shorter than with a slow burning\r\nexplosive.\r\n\r\n_Results obtained in Japan._—From some experiments made by the author\r\nin the grounds of the Meteorological Department in Tokio, the following\r\nresults were obtained:—\r\n\r\n  A. Velocity in feet per second for the first 200 ft. (A to B)\r\n  B. Velocity in feet per second for the second 200 ft. (B to C)\r\n  C. Velocity in feet per second for 400 ft. (A to C)\r\n  D.

For vertical motion.\r\n    (_a_) For the first 200 feet. The velocity depends upon the initial\r\n        force—the greater the charge of dynamite the greater the\r\n        velocity.\r\n    (_b_) For the second 200 feet. The above law only appears in\r\n        experiments IV. and V., but it must be remembered that the\r\n        origins of I. and III. were farther removed from A than IV.\r\n        and V.\r\n  The speed of the wave during the second 200 feet is always less\r\n        than during the first 200 feet.\r\n\r\n  2. For normal vibrations.\r\n    Here the speed between A and C is all that was measured, but we\r\n        again see that the greater the initial force, or the nearer\r\n        we are to the origin of the disturbance, the greater is the\r\n        velocity. This velocity is greater than the velocity of the\r\n        vertical or transverse vibrations.\r\n\r\n  3. For transverse vibrations.\r\n    If we assume that the vertical vibrations are a component of the\r\n        transverse motions we see the same law as before—namely, that\r\n        the nearer we are to the origin of the disturbance the greater\r\n        is the speed with which that disturbance is propagated.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the chief law here enunciated respecting the\r\ndecrease in speed of earth vibrations is the same as that pointed\r\nout by General Abbot, from which it only differs by its being in all\r\ncases proved without the introduction of personal errors, for the same\r\nexplosion, along the same line of ground and for different kinds of\r\nvibrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     EARTHQUAKE MOTION AS DEDUCED FROM OBSERVATION ON EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n  Result of feelings—The direction of motion—Instruments as indicators\r\n    of direction—Duration of an earthquake—Period of vibration—The\r\n    amplitude of earth movements—Side of greatest motion—Intensity\r\n    of earthquakes—Velocity and acceleration of an earth\r\n    particle—Absolute intensity of an earthquake—Radiation of an\r\n    earthquake—Velocity of propagation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Result of Feelings._—As the result of our experiences, and by\r\nobservations upon the movements produced in various bodies, we can\r\nsay that an ordinary earthquake consists of a number of backward and\r\nforward motions of the ground following each other in quick succession.\r\nSometimes these commence and die out so gently that those who have\r\nendeavoured to time the duration of an earthquake have found it\r\ndifficult to say when the shock commenced and when it ended. This was\r\na difficulty which Mr. James Bissett in Yokohama, and the author in\r\nTokio, had to contend against when, in 1878, they commenced to time\r\nshocks between these two places.\r\n\r\nSometimes these motions gradually increase to a maximum and then die\r\nout as gradually as they commenced.\r\n\r\nSometimes the maximum comes suddenly, and at other times during an\r\nearthquake our feelings distinctly tell us that there are several\r\nmaxima.\r\n\r\nThese have been the experiences of many observers, and have been\r\nrecorded by writers since the earliest times. Mallet devotes a\r\nchapter to a consideration of the tremulous motion that precedes and\r\nfollows a shock, and he tells us that a single shock is an absolute\r\nimpossibility. In speaking of earthquakes, he says: ‘The almost\r\nuniversal succession of phenomena recorded in earthquakes is, first a\r\ntrembling, then a severe shock, or several in quick succession, and\r\nthen a trembling gradually but rapidly becoming insensible.’\r\n\r\nA quantitative and exact knowledge of the nature of earthquake\r\nmotion has only been attained of late years. The chief results which\r\ninvestigators have aimed at have been the measurement of the amplitude,\r\nthe period, the direction, and the duration of the motions which\r\nconstitute an earthquake. Attention has also been given to the velocity\r\nwith which a disturbance is propagated.\r\n\r\n_The Direction of Motion._—One of the most ordinary observations\r\nwhich are made about an earthquake is its direction. If we were to\r\nask the inhabitants of a town which had been shaken by an earthquake\r\nthe direction of the motion they experienced, it is not unlikely that\r\ntheir replies would include all the points of the compass. Many,\r\nin consequence of their alarm, have not been able to make accurate\r\nobservations. Others have been deceived by the motion of the building\r\nin which they were situated. Some tell us that the motion had been\r\nnorth and south, whilst others say that it was east and west. A certain\r\nnumber have recognised several motions, and amongst the rest there will\r\nbe a few who have felt a wriggling or twisting. Leaving out exceptional\r\ncases, the general result obtained from personal observation as to\r\nthe direction of an earthquake of moderate intensity is extremely\r\nindefinite, and the only satisfactory information to be obtained is\r\nthat derived from instruments or from the effects of the earthquake\r\nexhibited in shattered buildings and bodies which had been overturned\r\nor projected.\r\n\r\nBy the direction in which walls, columns, and other objects had been\r\noverthrown or fractured, Mallet was enabled to determine the position\r\nof the origin of the Neapolitan earthquake. Similar phenomena have many\r\ntimes been taken advantage of by other investigators of earthquake\r\nphenomena. Effects produced upon structures are, however, only to be\r\nobserved as the results of a destructive earthquake, at which time\r\ncities may be regarded as collections of seismometers. (_See_ chapter\r\non Effects in Buildings.)\r\n\r\nTo determine the direction of movement during a small earthquake, the\r\nmost satisfactory method appears to be an appeal to instruments.\r\n\r\n_Instruments as Indicators of Direction._—The relative values of\r\ndifferent kinds of instruments, such as columns, pendulums, and the\r\nlike, as indicators of direction have already been discussed.\r\n\r\nBy the use of pendulum seismographs it has been shown that during an\r\nearthquake the ground may move in one, two, or several directions (see\r\np. 21); and it is, generally speaking, only in those cases where we\r\nexperience a decided shock in the disturbance that we can determine\r\nwith any confidence the direction in which the motion has been\r\npropagated. Such directions are usually indicated by the major axis of\r\ncertain more or less elliptical figures which have been drawn, which\r\nin themselves appear to indicate the combination of two rectilinear\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nResults similar to those indicated by the records of pendulum\r\nseismographs have also been obtained upon moving plates with a double\r\nbracket seismograph. Thus, in the earthquake which shook Tokio at 6\r\nA.M. on July 5, 1881, there were indications of the following\r\nmotions:—\r\n\r\nNear the commencement of the shock the motion was N. 112° E. One and a\r\nhalf second after this, the direction of motion appears to have been\r\nN. 50° E. In three-fourths of a second more it gradually changed to a\r\ndirection N. 145° E., and after a similar interval to N. 62° E. Half a\r\nsecond after this it was N. 132° E., and four seconds later the motion\r\nwas again in the original direction—namely, N. 112° E.\r\n\r\nThese particular directions of motion have been selected because they\r\nwere so definitely indicated.\r\n\r\nThe commonest type of earthquake which is experienced in Japan, and\r\nprobably also in other earthquake-shaken districts, is the compound or\r\ndiastrophic form.\r\n\r\nThat earthquakes often have motions compounded of two sets of\r\nvibrations, has also been proved by the analysis of the records\r\nobtained from two component seismographs. From an analysis of a record\r\nof this description, Professor Ewing has shown that in the earthquake\r\nfelt in Tokio on March 11, 1881, there were approximate circular\r\n(somewhat spiral) movements.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the consideration of the twisting and wriggling\r\nmotions which are said to be experienced by some observers. Motions\r\nlike these, which by the Italians and Mexicans are called _vorticosi_,\r\nare usually supposed to be the cause of objects like chimneys and\r\ngravestones being rotated. These phenomena, it will be seen from what\r\nis said in the chapter upon the effects produced in buildings, can be\r\nmore easily explained upon the supposition of a simple rectilinear\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThat at the time of an earthquake there may be motion in more than one\r\ndirection has been recognised since the time of Aristotle; and it is\r\npossible that two sets of rectilinear motion, as, for instance, the\r\nnormal and transverse movements, may have led observers to imagine that\r\nthere has been a twisting motion taking place, and this especially when\r\nthe two sets of movements have quickly succeeded each other.\r\n\r\nPersons inside flexible buildings may possibly have experienced more\r\nor less of a rotatory motion, although the shock was rectilinear; the\r\nbuilding assuming such a motion in consequence of its construction and\r\nits position with regard to the direction of the shock.\r\n\r\nIn the case of destructive earthquakes, especially at points situated\r\npractically above the origin, the universal testimony, Mallet tells\r\nus, is that a twisting, wriggling motion in different planes, attended\r\nby an up-and-down movement of greater range, is experienced. To such\r\ndisturbances the word _sussultatore_ is sometimes applied. Mallet has\r\ngiven many elliptical and other closed curves to illustrate the nature\r\nof such motions.\r\n\r\n_Duration of an Earthquake._—When reading accounts of earthquakes\r\nit is often difficult to determine the length of time a shaking was\r\ncontinuous. In Japan, in A.D. 745, there was a shaking which is said\r\nto have lasted sixty hours; and in A.D. 977 there were a series of\r\nshakings lasting 300 days. Often we meet with records of disturbances\r\nwhich have lasted from twenty to seventy days.\r\n\r\nAt San Salvador, in 1879, more than 600 shocks were felt within ten\r\ndays; in 1850, at Honduras, there were 108 shocks in a week; in 1746,\r\nat Lima, 200 shocks were felt in twenty-four hours; at the island of\r\nSt. Thomas, in 1868, 283 shocks were felt during about ten hours.\r\n\r\nDisturbances like these, which succeed each other with sufficient\r\nrapidity to cause an almost continual trembling in the ground, may be\r\nregarded as collectively forming one great seismic effort which may\r\nlast a minute, an hour, a day, a week, or even several years. Strictly\r\nspeaking, they are a series of separate earthquakes, the resultant\r\nvibrations of which more or less overlap. Whenever a large earthquake\r\noccurs it is generally succeeded by a large number of smaller shocks.\r\n\r\nThe seismic disturbance as regards time is, as Mallet remarks, very\r\noften ‘like an occasional cannonade during a continuous but irregular\r\nrattle of musketry.’ In the New Zealand earthquake of 1848, shocks\r\ncontinued for nearly five weeks, and during a large portion of the time\r\nthere were at least 1,000 shocks per day.[12]\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of Lisbon, which in five minutes destroyed the whole\r\ntown, was followed by a series of disturbances lasting over several\r\nmonths. After Basle had, on October 18, 1356, been laid in ruins,\r\nit is stated shocks followed each other for a period of a year. The\r\nCalabrian earthquake was continued with considerable strength for a\r\nyear, and it is said that the earth did not come completely to rest for\r\nten years. During this cannonade the heavy shocks announced, as they\r\ndo in most earthquake countries at the present day, a series of weaker\r\ndisturbances. In certain exceptional cases this order of events has\r\nbeen inverted, and slight shocks have announced the coming of heavy\r\nones. Fuchs gives an example of this in the earthquake of Broussa, when\r\nthe first shock was on February 28, 1855. On March 9 and 23 there were\r\nheavier shocks, but the heaviest did not arrive until March 28.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions it is possible to have a sensible vibration\r\nproduced in the ground which is practically of unlimited duration;\r\nthus, for instance, it has been noticed that the falling of water\r\nat certain large waterfalls, by its continuous rhythmical impact on\r\nthe rocks, produces in them tremors which are to be observed at\r\ngreat distances. Of this the author convinced himself at the Falls\r\nof Niagara, where he observed the reflected and ever-moving image of\r\nthe sun in a pool of water. Under favourable circumstances almost\r\ncontinual condensation of steam might take place in volcanic foci, each\r\ncondensation giving rise to a blow sufficiently powerful to produce\r\nvibrations in the surrounding ground. Those who have stood near a large\r\ngeyser, like the one in Iceland, when it makes an ineffectual effort\r\nto erupt, will recognise how powerful such a cause might be. Humboldt\r\nhas remarked shocks on Vesuvius and Pichincha which were periodic,\r\noccurring twenty to thirty seconds before each ejection of vapour and\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes like these may be of vast extent, gradually spreading\r\nfurther and further outwards. This spreading of earth vibrations may\r\nbe observed at a large factory containing heavy machinery or a steam\r\nhammer. After the machinery comes to rest, it is probably some time\r\nbefore the ground returns to rest. Examples of disturbances of this\r\nnature are spoken of under the head of Earth Tremors.\r\n\r\nThe record of the duration of an ordinary earthquake as observed at a\r\ngiven point is dependent upon the sensibility of our instruments.\r\n\r\nContinuous motions perceptible to our senses without the aid of\r\ninstruments usually last from thirty seconds to about two or three\r\nminutes. In Japan the shocks, as timed by watches, usually last from\r\ntwenty to forty seconds. Occasionally a continuous shaking is felt for\r\nmore than one and a half minutes, and cases have been recorded where\r\nthe motion has continued for as much as four minutes and thirty-three\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nSeismometers having a multiplication of 6 to 12 usually indicate that\r\nmotion continues longer than is perceptible to the senses.\r\n\r\n_Period of Vibration._—When an earthquake contains several prominent\r\nvibrations which might be called the _shocks_ of the disturbance, our\r\nfeelings tell us that these have occurred at unequal intervals.\r\n\r\nAbout the time which is taken for the complete backward and forward\r\noscillation of the ground which constitutes the shock a little has\r\nalready been said. This was deduced from the records of disturbances as\r\ndrawn by seismographs. From the same sources we can readily obtain the\r\nperiod of all the prominent vibrations in a disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn any given earthquake there are irregularities in period, and\r\ndifferent earthquakes differ from each other. About the early attempts\r\nto determine the period of earth vibrations something has been said in\r\nthe chapter on Earthquake Instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the earthquake of March 11 (referred to on p. 70) we find that both\r\ncomponents commenced with a series of small vibrations, about five or\r\nsix to the second; next came the shock, consisting of two complete\r\nvibrations executed in two seconds. In this it is to be observed that\r\nthe motion eastwards was performed much more quickly than the motion\r\nwestwards. Next, by reference to the east and west component, it is\r\nseen that there are a number of large vibrations, about one per second,\r\non which a number of smaller motions are superposed. As the motion\r\nproceeds, these become less and less definitely pronounced and more\r\nirregular in their intervals, until finally the motion dies away.\r\n\r\nThis earthquake, as recorded at the author’s house in Tokio, lasted\r\nabout one and a half minute.\r\n\r\nThe same earthquake, as recorded by Professor Ewing at a station\r\nsituated about one and a half mile distant, but on flat ground, appears\r\nto have lasted four and a half minutes. The largest wave had a period\r\nof 0·7 second.\r\n\r\nIn the earthquake of March 8, 1881, there were on an average 1·4\r\nvibrations per second. These vibrations were executed in a direction\r\ntransverse to the line joining the observing station and the locality\r\nfrom which the disturbance must have originated as determined by time\r\nobservations. It can, therefore, be assumed that these vibrations,\r\nhaving so slow a period, were transverse motions, this slowness or\r\nsluggishness being due to the fact that the modulus for distortion\r\nis less than the modulus which governs the propagation of normal\r\nvibrations.\r\n\r\n_The Amplitude of Earth Movements._—In making estimates of the\r\ndistances through which we are moved backward and forward at the time\r\nof an earthquake, if we judge by our feelings, we may often be misled.\r\nIf a person is out of doors and walking, an earthquake may take place\r\nsufficiently strong to cause chimneys to fall and unroof houses, which,\r\nso far as the actual shaking of the ground is concerned, will be passed\r\nby unnoticed. On the other hand, to persons indoors, especially on an\r\nupper story, it is impossible even for a tremor to pass by without\r\ncreating considerable alarm by the angular movement that has been taken\r\nup by the building.\r\n\r\nMany observers have endeavoured to make actual measurements of the\r\nmaximum extent through which the earth moves at the time of an\r\nearthquake. Among the reports of the British Association for 1841 is\r\nthe report of a committee which had been appointed ‘for obtaining\r\ninstruments and registers to record shocks of earthquakes in Scotland\r\nand Ireland’. We read that in one earthquake which had been measured\r\nthe displacement of the ground had been half an inch, and in another\r\nit had been less than half an inch. The instruments used to make these\r\nobservations depended upon the inertia of pendulums which at the time\r\nof the disturbance were supposed to remain at rest. Observations\r\nsimilar to these have been made in Japan. One long series were made by\r\nMr. E. Knipping for Dr. Gr. Wagener. They extended from November 1878\r\nto April 1880, and were as follows:—\r\n\r\n   Number of     Maximum horizontal\r\n  Earthquakes    motion of the ground\r\n      10            ·0   to  0·15 mm.\r\n       7            ·15   „  0·5  „\r\n       8            ·5    „  2·5  „\r\n       2           2·5    „  more „\r\n\r\nWith his apparatus for vertical motion Dr. Wagener also made\r\nobservations on the absolute vertical motion. This seldom reached ·02\r\nmm. The greatest value was that observed for the destructive shock of\r\nFeb. 22, 1880, which was ·56 mm.\r\n\r\nBy means of a number of instruments distributed at various localities\r\nround Tokio, the chief of which were pendulums with friction pointers\r\nto render them ‘_dead beat_,’ and with magnifying apparatus to show\r\nthe actual motion of the ground, the author arrived at results similar\r\nto those obtained by Dr. Wagener—namely, that the earth’s maximum\r\nhorizontal motion at the time of a small earthquake was usually only\r\nthe fraction of a millimetre, and it seldom exceeded three or four\r\nmillimetres. When we get a motion of five or six millimetres, we\r\nusually find that brick and stone chimneys have been shattered.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained for vertical motion were also very small. In Tokio\r\nit is seldom that vertical motion can be detected, and when it is\r\nrecorded it is seldom more than a millimetre.\r\n\r\nThese results, which were put forward some years ago, have since\r\nreceived confirmation by the use of a variety of instruments in the\r\nhands of different observers.\r\n\r\nMallet, in his account of the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857,\r\napproximated to the amplitude of an earth particle by observing the\r\nwidth, at the level of the centre of gravity, of fissures formed\r\nthrough and remaining in great masses of very inelastic masonry.\r\n\r\nTaking stations situated on or very nearly on the same line passing\r\nthrough the seismic vertical (_epicentrum_), Mallet observed the\r\namplitude increased as some function of the distance, as will be seen\r\nfrom the following table:—\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+------+-------+-------+---------+-------+\r\n  |          Station        |Polla |La Sala|Certosa|Tramutola|Sarconi|\r\n  +-------------------------+------+-------+-------+---------+-------+\r\n  | Distance from Seismic } |      |       |       |         |       |\r\n  |  Vertical in          } | 3·45 | 11·60 | 16·50 |  20·60  | 26·7  |\r\n  |  geographical miles   } |      |       |       |         |       |\r\n  | Amplitude in inches     | 2·5  |  3·5  |  4·0  |   4·5   |  4·75 |\r\n  +-------------------------+------+-------+-------+---------+-------+\r\n\r\nThe possibility of a law such as this having an existence for places at\r\na distance from the seismic vertical comparable with the vertical depth\r\nof the centrum will be shown farther on.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the maximum displacement of an earth particle. Mallet\r\nwas of opinion that there was evidence to show that it had in some\r\ncases been over one foot. M. Abella, in an earthquake which occurred in\r\nthe Philippines in 1881, made a rough observation of the motion of the\r\nearth to a distance of about _two metres_. This, as might be expected,\r\nwas beyond the elastic limits of the material, and caused fissures to\r\nbe formed, which were seen to open and shut.\r\n\r\n_Intensity of Earthquakes._—In speaking of the strength of an\r\nearthquake, we usually employ terms like ‘weak,’ ‘strong,’ ‘violent,’\r\n&c. Although these expressions, accompanied by illustration of the\r\neffects which an earth quake has produced, convey a general idea of\r\nthe strength of a shock as felt at some particular locality, our ideas\r\nnevertheless wanting in definiteness; and if we endeavour to compare\r\none shock with another, as a whole, our want of exactness is augmented.\r\nWe have seen that Palmieri’s seismograph indicates intensity by a\r\ncertain number of degrees, which, to a certain extent, is a measure of\r\nthe violence of the motion as indicated at a particular locality. The\r\ndegrees, as before stated, refer to the height to which in consequence\r\nof the shaking, a certain quantity of mercury was washed in a tube,\r\nwhich is a function of the depth of mercury in the tube, and also of\r\nthe duration of the disturbance.\r\n\r\nFrom this it seems possible that a very slow motion of small amplitude,\r\ncontinuing over a sufficient period of time, might, if it agreed with\r\nthe period of the mercury, indicate an earthquake of many degrees of\r\nintensity, whilst residents in the neighbourhood might not have noticed\r\nthe disturbance; and, on the other hand, a short but intense shock\r\ncreating considerable destruction might have been recorded as of only a\r\nfew degrees of intensity.\r\n\r\nAlthough objections like these might be raised to such a method of\r\nrecording intensity, in practice it would appear that such results are\r\nnot pronounced, and the indications of the instrument usually give us\r\napproximate indications of relative intensity.\r\n\r\nIn writing about the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857, Mallet says that\r\n‘area alone affords no test of seismic energy.’\r\n\r\nThe area over which a shock is felt will depend not only upon the\r\ninitial force of the disturbance, but also upon the focal depth of\r\na shock, the form and position of that focus, the duration of the\r\ndisturbance, and the nature and arrangement of the materials which are\r\nshaken.\r\n\r\nFrom observations in Japan, it is clearly shown that massive mountain\r\nranges exert a considerable influence upon the extension of seismal\r\ndisturbances. On one side of a large range of mountains large cities\r\nmight be laid in ruins, whilst on the other side the disturbance\r\ncreating this destruction might not be noticed.\r\n\r\n_Velocity and Acceleration of an Earth Particle._—We now pass on to\r\nmethods of determining the intensity of an earthquake which are less\r\narbitrary than those which have just been discussed. These methods have\r\nalready been discussed when speaking of artificial disturbances, where\r\nit was shown that the intensity of an earthquake as measured by its\r\ndestructive effects greatly depended upon the suddenness with which the\r\nbackward and forward motions of the ground were commenced or ended.\r\n\r\nAmongst the earlier investigators of seismic phenomena who observed\r\nthat there existed a connection between the distance to which bodies\r\nhad been projected during an earthquake and the suddenness or initial\r\nvelocity with which the ground had been moved beneath them, was\r\nProfessor Wenthrop of Cambridge, Massachusetts, who noted that bricks\r\nfrom his chimneys had, by the New England earthquake of 1755, been\r\nthrown thirty feet. From this and the known height of the chimney, he\r\ncalculates that the bricks had been projected with an initial velocity\r\nof twenty-one feet per second.[13]\r\n\r\nThe calculations made by Mallet respecting the maximum velocity of\r\nan earth particle at the time of the Neapolitan earthquake in 1857\r\ndepended upon the overthrow, projection, and fracture of bodies.\r\n\r\nThe principles which guided him in making the calculations will be\r\nunderstood from the following illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nIf a column, A B C D, receive a shock or be suddenly moved in the\r\ndirection of the arrow, the centre of gravity, G, of this column will\r\nrevolve round the edge, and tend to describe the path G O. If it passes\r\nO, the column will fall. The work done in such a case as this is equal\r\nto lifting the column through the height _o_ _h_.\r\n\r\nIf G A = _a_, the angle G A _h_ = φ, and the weight of the body = W,\r\nthen the above work equals\r\n\r\n                           W_a_ (1 - cos φ).\r\n\r\nThis must equal the work acquired—that is to say, the kinetic energy of\r\nrotation of the body, or\r\n\r\n                                        W _w_^2 K^2\r\n                     W_a_ (1 - cos φ) = ———————————.\r\n                                           2 _g_\r\n\r\nWhere _w_ is the angular velocity of the body at starting, K the radius\r\nof gyration round A, and _g_ the velocity acquired by a falling body in\r\none second. Whence\r\n\r\n                    _w_^2 K^2 = 2 _ga_ (1 - cos φ),\r\n\r\nbut _w_, the angular velocity, is equal to the statical couple applied,\r\ndivided by the moment of inertia, or,\r\n\r\n                                 V_a_ cos φ\r\n                           _w_ = ——————————,\r\n                                    K^2\r\n\r\nsquaring and substituting\r\n\r\n                                  K^2   1 - cos φ\r\n                     V^2 = 2_g_ × ——— × —————————,\r\n                                  _a_    cos^2 φ\r\n\r\n                                                            K^2\r\nand since the length of the corresponding pendulum is _l_ = ———,\r\n                                                            _a_\r\n\r\n                                      1 - cos φ\r\n                        V^2 = 2_gl_ × —————————.\r\n                                       cos^2 φ\r\n\r\nTo apply this to any given case we must find the value of _l_ or of\r\n\r\nK^2\r\n———.\r\n_a_\r\n\r\nMallet finds these values for the cube, solid and hollow rectangular\r\nparallelopipeds, solid and hollow cylinders, &c. In these formulæ we\r\nhave a direct connection between the dimensions and form of a body and\r\nthe velocity with which the ground must move beneath it to cause its\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nNot only is the case discussed for horizontal forces, but also for\r\nforces acting obliquely. Similar reasonings are applied to the\r\nproductions of fractures in walls, but as there is uncertainty in our\r\nknowledge of the co-efficient of force necessary to produce fracture\r\n_through joints across_ beds of masonry, the deductions ought not to\r\nbe applied as the measures of velocity. Where the fractures occur at\r\nthe base or in horizontal planes, or in those of the continuous beds of\r\nthe masonry, or through homogeneous bodies, the uncertainty is not so\r\ngreat, and for cases like these Mallet gives several illustrations. The\r\ndistance to which bodies had been projected, as, for example, ornaments\r\nfrom the tops of pedestals, coping-stones from the edges of roofs, were\r\nalso used as means of determining the angle at which the shock had\r\nemerged, or, if this be known, for determining the velocity.\r\n\r\nThus by a shock in the direction O C, a ball, A, on the top of a\r\npedestal would describe a trajectory to the point C. Let the angle\r\nwhich O C makes with the horizon be _e_, the vertical height through\r\nwhich the ball has fallen be _b_, and the horizontal distance of\r\nprojection be _a_; then\r\n\r\n                                          _a_^2\r\n                   _b_ = _a_ tan _e_ + ————————————,\r\n                                       4H cos^2 _e_\r\n\r\nH being the height due to the velocity of projection.

It was then shown that such bodies before being\r\noverthrown may often be caused to rock, and therefore that their final\r\noverthrow may not have any direct connection with the impulse of the\r\nsucceeding shock.\r\n\r\nAnother point to which attention must be drawn respecting the above\r\ncalculations is that if there was no friction or adherence between the\r\nprojected body and its pedestal, in consequence of its inertia it\r\nwould be left behind by the forward motion of the shock, and simply\r\ndrop at the foot of its support. In the case of frictional adherence it\r\nwould be carried forward by the velocity acquired before this adherence\r\nwas broken, and thrown in a direction _opposite_ to that given in the\r\nfigure—that is to say, in the direction of the shock.[14]\r\n\r\n_The Absolute Intensity of the Force exerted by an Earthquake._—No\r\ndoubt it has occurred to many who have experienced an earthquake\r\nthat the power which gave birth to such a disturbance must have been\r\nenormously great. The estimates which we shall make of the absolute\r\namount of energy represented by an earthquake cannot, on account of the\r\nnature of the factors with which we deal, be regarded as accurate. They\r\nmay, however, be of assistance in forming estimates of quantities about\r\nwhich we have at present no conception. One method of obtaining the\r\nresult we seek is that which was employed by Mallet in his calculations\r\nrespecting the Neapolitan earthquake. Although disbelieving in the\r\ngeneral increment of temperature as we descend in the earth at an\r\naverage rate of 1° F. for every fifty or sixty feet of descent, for\r\nwant of better means. Mallet assumes this law to be true, and, knowing\r\nfrom a variety of observations the depth of various parts of the cavity\r\nfrom which the disturbance sprang, he calculates the temperatures of\r\nthis cavity in various parts as due to its depth beneath the surface.\r\nNext, it is assumed that steam was suddenly admitted into this cavity,\r\nwhich might exert the greatest possible pressure due to the maximum\r\ntemperature. This was calculated as being about 684 atmospheres.\r\n\r\nNext, he determined the column of limestone necessary to balance such a\r\npressure, which is about 8,550 feet in height. As the least thickness\r\nof strata above this cavity was 16,700 feet, the pressure of 684\r\natmospheres was not sufficient to blow away its cover, but if suddenly\r\nadmitted or generated in the cavity it might have produced the wave of\r\nimpulse by the sudden compression of the walls of the cavity.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of 684 atmospheres is equivalent to about 4·58 tons on\r\nthe square inch, and, as the total area of the walls of the cavity is\r\ncalculated at twenty-seven square miles, the total accumulated pressure\r\nwould be more than 640,528 millions of tons. Mallet, however, shows\r\nthat it is probable that the temperature of the focal cavity was much\r\ngreater than that due to the hypogeal increment, and that therefore the\r\npressure may have been greater.\r\n\r\nThe capability of producing the earthquake impulse, however, depends\r\non the _suddenness_ with which the steam is flashed off. According\r\nto the experiments of Boutigny and others, Mallet tells us that the\r\nmost sudden production of steam would take place at a temperature of\r\n500°-550° C., which is but a few degrees below that calculated for the\r\nmean focal depth.\r\n\r\nAssuming the above calculated pressure to be true, and knowing the\r\nco-efficient of compression of the materials on which it acted, the\r\nvolume of the wave at a given moment near the instant of starting—that\r\nis, at the focus—can be calculated, and from this the wave amplitude on\r\nreaching the surface may be deduced.\r\n\r\nProceeding backwards, if we have observed the wave amplitude,\r\ncalculated the depth of the focus, and know the co-efficient of\r\nexpansion, then the total compression may be calculated and the\r\ntemperature due to the pressure producing this may be arrived at. In\r\nthis way earthquakes may be used as a means of calculating subterranean\r\ntemperature at depths that can never be attained experimentally.\r\n\r\nA method of proceeding which is probably more definite than that\r\nadopted by Mallet would be the application of the method indicated when\r\nspeaking of the intensity of artificial disturbances.\r\n\r\nIf for a given earthquake the origin of which is known we have\r\ndetermined by seismographs the mean acceleration of an earth particle\r\nat two or more stations at different distances from that origin, we are\r\nenabled to construct a curve of intensity the area between which and\r\nits asymptotes was shown to be a measure of the total intensity of the\r\nshock. Comparing this area with that of a unit disturbance produced,\r\nsay, by the explosion of a pound of dynamite, one may approximately\r\ncalculate in terms of this unit the initial intensity of the earthquake.\r\n\r\n_Radiation of an Earthquake._—The tremors preceding the more violent\r\nmovements of an earthquake may be due, as Mallet has suggested,[15]\r\nto the free surface waves reaching a distant point before the direct\r\nvibrations.\r\n\r\nThe fact that earth vibrations produced by striking a blow on or near\r\nthe surface of the ground are wholly obliterated in reaching a cutting\r\nor valley, there being no underground waves of distortion to crop up\r\non the opposite side of the valley, indicates that the disturbance is\r\none that travels on the surface; the same fact is illustrated when we\r\nendeavour to transmit vibrations through the side of a hill into a\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nIn the tunnel, although the distance may be small, no sensible effects\r\nare produced, whilst the same disturbance may be recorded at a long\r\ndistance from its origin on the surface of the ground outside the\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\nLastly, we may refer to the experiences of miners underground.\r\n\r\nOccasionally it has happened that miners when deep underground, as in\r\nthe Marienberg in the Saxon Erzgebirge, have felt shocks which have not\r\nbeen noticed on the surface. These observations are rare, and it is\r\npossible that they may be explained by the caving in of subterranean\r\nexcavations.\r\n\r\nThe usual experience is, that if a shock is felt underground it is also\r\nfelt on the surface, as for example in the lead mines in Derbyshire at\r\nthe time of the Lisbon disturbance (1755).\r\n\r\nThe most frequent observation, however, is that a shock may be felt on\r\nthe surface while it is not remarked by the miners beneath the surface,\r\nas at Fahlun and Presburg in November, 1823.\r\n\r\nAt the Comstock Lode in Colorado about twelve years ago many\r\nearthquakes were felt. On one particular day twenty-four were counted.\r\nSuperintendent Charles Foreman told the author when he visited Virginia\r\nCity in 1882, that special observations were made to determine whether\r\nthese shocks were felt as severely deep down in the mines as on the\r\nsurface, where they were on the verge of being destructive. The\r\nuniversal testimony of many observers was that in most cases they were\r\nnot felt at all underground, and when a shock was felt it was extremely\r\nfeeble. At Takashima Colliery, in Japan, it is seldom that shocks are\r\nfelt underground.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these latter observations appears to be either\r\nthat, in consequence of a smaller amplitude of motion in the solid\r\nrocks beneath the surface as compared with the extent of motion on\r\nthe surface, the disturbances are passed by unnoticed, or else the\r\ndisturbance is, at a distance from its origin, practically confined to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n_Velocity of Propagation of an Earthquake._—Although many have written\r\nupon earthquakes and have endeavoured to give to us the velocity with\r\nwhich they were propagated, the subject is one about which we have as\r\nyet but little exact information.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this branch of investigation is undoubtedly great.\r\nBy knowing the velocity with which an earthquake has travelled in\r\nvarious directions we are assisted in determining the locality of\r\nits origin; we may possibly make important deductions respecting the\r\nnature of the medium through which it has passed; perhaps also we\r\nmay learn something regarding the intensity of the disturbance which\r\ncreated the earthquake. In the Report of the British Association for\r\n1851 Mallet gives the table on next page, in which are placed together\r\nthe approximate rates of transit of shocks of several earthquakes\r\nwhich he discusses. Some of these, it will be observed, are records of\r\ndisturbances which must have passed through or across the bed of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIn Mallet’s British Association Report for 1858, he gives data compiled\r\nby Mr. David Milne[16] respecting the Lisbon earthquakes of 1755 and\r\n1761, from which data the tables of velocities (p. 89) have been\r\ncalculated, omitting those which Mr. Mallet has marked as uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe distances are marked in degrees of seventy English miles each, and\r\nthe time is reduced to Lisbon time.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------+-------+--------------------------+----------+\r\n  |                     |Approx.|                          |          |\r\n  |                     |rate in| Formation constituting   |          |\r\n  | Occasion and Place  |feet   | Range on surface as far  |Authority |\r\n  |                     | per   | as known or conjectured  |          |\r\n  |                     |second |                          |          |\r\n  +---------------------+-------+--------------------------+----------+\r\n  |Rev.

Two interesting\r\nfacts are, however, observable: the first being that the velocities\r\nfor the earthquake of 1761 are much higher than those obtained for the\r\nearthquake of 1755; and, secondly, that in both cases the velocities as\r\ndetermined from the observations of ships at sea closely approximate\r\nto each other, in all cases being nearly the same as that with which a\r\nsound wave would travel through water.\r\n\r\nThe great differences in transit velocity obtained for different\r\nearthquakes is a point worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nSeebach’s velocity is a _true_ transit velocity, and its determination\r\nis dependent on the assumption that the shock radiated from the\r\n_centrum_ and not from the _epicentrum_, Seebach’s method is explained\r\nwhen speaking about the determination of origins.\r\n\r\nSome interesting observations on the velocity with which the earthquake\r\nof October 7, 1874, was propagated, are given by M. S. di Rossi.[18]\r\n\r\nOne assumption is that the disturbance radiated from an origin\r\nto surrounding points of observation, whilst another is that the\r\ndisturbance followed natural fractures, the direction of which is\r\nderived from the crest of certain mountain ranges. These velocities are\r\nas follows, Maradi being at or near the origin of the disturbance:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n  | Velocity in feet per second |  Velocity in feet per second by   |\r\n  |   with direct radiation     | propagation along mountain chains |\r\n  +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n  | Modigliana       820        | By the Valley of Marenzo    1,080 |\r\n  | Bologna          656        |  „       „       Saveno     1,080 |\r\n  | Forli            874        |  „       „       Montone    1,080 |\r\n  | Modena           518        |  „       „       Panaro    {1,080 |\r\n  |                             |                            {  984 |\r\n  | Firenze          273        |  „       „       Sieve        540 |\r\n  | Compiobbi        328        |  „       „         „          540 |\r\n  +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+\r\n\r\nAnother set of interesting results are those of P. Serpieri on the\r\nearthquake of March 12, 1873. The curious manner in which this shock\r\nradiated is described in the chapter on the Geographical Distribution\r\nof Earthquakes (see p. 231). Two large areas appear to have been\r\nalmost simultaneously struck, so that, there being no time for elastic\r\nyielding, the velocities calculated between places situated on either\r\nof the areas are exceedingly great.[19]\r\n\r\n  From Ragusa to  Venice the velocity was 2,734 feet per second\r\n   „   Spoleto     „            „         4,101   „        „\r\n   „   Perugia to Orvieto       „           601   „        „\r\n   „      „     „ Ancona        „         1,640   „        „\r\n   „      „     „ Rome          „    {    1,640   „        „\r\n                                     {or, 2,186\r\n\r\nThe following are examples of approximate earthquake velocities which\r\nhave been determined in Japan.\r\n\r\n_The Tokio Earthquake of October 25, 1881._—From records respecting\r\nthis earthquake it appears to have been felt over the whole of Yezo\r\nand the northern and eastern coast of Nipon, a little farther south\r\nthan Tokio. It was severest at Nemuro and Hakodate, and at the former\r\nplace a little damage was done. From these facts, together with the\r\nindications of instruments recording direction of movement and a\r\ngeneral inspection of the time records, it seems that the disturbance\r\nmust have originated beneath the sea on the east coast of Yezo at a\r\nvery long distance to the north-east of Tokio, from which place it\r\npassed in a practically direct line on to Yokohama.\r\n\r\nAs the disturbance was felt at Yokohama twenty-one seconds later than\r\nat Tokio, and the distances between these two places is about sixteen\r\ngeographical miles, for this portion of its course the disturbance\r\nmust have travelled at a rate of at least 4,300 _feet per second_. If\r\nwe assume that the shock, after having reached Hakodate, travelled on\r\nat the same rate as it did between Tokio and Yokohama in order to reach\r\nSaporo, where the shaking was felt eighteen seconds after Hakodate,\r\nit must have had about thirteen geographical miles to travel after\r\nHakodate was shaken before Saporo felt its effect.\r\n\r\nDrawing from Hakodate a tangent to the eastern side of a circle of\r\nthirteen miles radius described round Saporo, the origin of the\r\ndisturbance must be on the line bisecting this tangent at right angles.\r\nAs it also lies on a line drawn through Tokio and Yokohama, it lies in\r\na position about 41 N. lat. and 144° 15′ E. long., which is a position\r\nsomewhat nearer to Nemuro than Hakodate, as we should anticipate. If\r\nthis be taken as approximately indicating the origin, then the shock,\r\nafter reaching Hakodate from the Hakodate _homoseist_, travelled about\r\n218 miles to reach Tokio in 128 seconds, which gives a _velocity of\r\n10,219 feet per second_.\r\n\r\nThe method here followed is equivalent to that of the hyperbola and one\r\ndirection (see p. 204). The hyperbola is described on the assumption\r\nthat the velocity deduced from the time taken to travel between Tokio\r\nand Yokohama is correct, and also that the earth waves travelled with\r\napproximately the same velocity in the vicinity of Saporo as near\r\nTokio. The probability, however, is that they travelled more quickly.\r\nIf this be so, then the origin is thrown somewhat to the south-east and\r\nthe velocity between the Hakodate homoseist and Tokio reduced. Thus,\r\nif the velocity in the Saporo district be double that observed in the\r\nTokio district, the origin is shifted about twenty-eight miles to the\r\nsouth-west, and the last-mentioned velocity is reduced to about 9,000\r\nfeet per second.\r\n\r\nIf we work by the method of circles, and assume the velocity to have\r\nbeen constant in all directions, then this velocity must have been\r\nabout 6,000 feet per second. If we assume that the indications of\r\ndirection obtained from seismographs and other sources give to us by\r\nthis intersection a proper origin, the velocity in some directions may\r\nhave been as much as 17,000 feet per second.\r\n\r\nAn origin thus determined, or even if determined by the method of\r\ncircles, is in discord with the fact that places like Nemuro, in the\r\nnorth-east of Yezo, were nearer to the origin than any of the other\r\nplaces which have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which we are therefore led to with regard to this shock,\r\nassuming of course that the time observations are tolerably correct,\r\nis that the velocity of propagation was variable, being greater when\r\nmeasured between points near to the origin than between points at a\r\ndistance. The velocities estimated vary between 4,000 and 9,000 feet\r\nper second.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the earthquake which has just been discussed, we have\r\nan example of a disturbance which must have passed between Tokio and\r\nYokohama in what was almost a straight line from the origin. As this\r\ndirection ought to give the maximum time of transit if all earthquakes\r\nare propagated with the same velocity, the following table is given of\r\nthe interval between the time of observation of several shocks at these\r\ntwo stations:—\r\n\r\n       FROM YOKOHAMA TO TOKIO.         FROM TOKIO TO YOKOHAMA.\r\n\r\n  1880 December 20th    36 seconds | 1882 October 25th   21 seconds\r\n  1881 January 7th   14–31    „    | 1883 February 6th   23    „\r\n   „   March  8th       60    „    |  „   March 1        53    „\r\n   „     „   17th.      66    „    |  „     „   „        63    „\r\n   „   November 15th    31    „    |  „          8th     27    „\r\n  1882 February 16th    22    „    |  „     „   11th     26    „\r\n\r\nAs these are observations which have been made with the assistance of a\r\ntelegraphic signal daily employed to correct and rate the clocks from\r\nwhich the observations were obtained, they may be regarded as being\r\ntolerably, correct.\r\n\r\nThe disturbance of February 6, the two shocks of March 1, appear, like\r\nthat of October 25, to have passed in almost a direct line from an\r\norigin in the N.N.E, through Tokio on to Yokohama. Their velocities of\r\npropagation as calculated from the above intervals are approximately\r\n3,900, 1,900, and 1,400 feet per second. The shock of February 16\r\nappears to have had its origin near to a point in Yedo Bay about eight\r\nmiles east of Yokohama. Assuming this to be the case, the shock between\r\nthe Yokohama homoseist and Tokio travelled at the rate of 2,454 feet\r\nper second, but between the Tokio homoseist and Chiba at the rate\r\nof 750 feet per second; that is to say, the velocity of propagation\r\nrapidly decreased as the disturbance spread outwards.\r\n\r\nAt Yokohama it was recorded at 5.31.54, at Tokio at 5.32.16, and at\r\nChiba at 5.33.48. These times are given in Tokio mean time.\r\n\r\nThe shock of March 11, which was recorded at Tokio at 7.51.22 P.M.\r\nand at Yokohama at 7.51.33 P.M., appears, from the indications of\r\ninstruments which were exceptionally definite in their records, to have\r\noriginated in the N.E. corner of Yedo Bay, about nineteen miles S.S.W.\r\nfrom Chiba. This shock was rather severe, fracturing several chimneys.\r\nFrom the Tokio homoseist it appears to have travelled on to Yokohama at\r\nthe rate of about 2,200 feet per second. Assuming these observations\r\nto be _approximately_ accurate, if we take them with the records of\r\nprevious observers they lead us to the following conclusions:—\r\n\r\n1. Different earthquakes, although they may travel across the same\r\ncountry, have very variable velocities, varying between several\r\nhundreds and several thousands of feet per second.\r\n\r\n2. The same earthquake travels more quickly across districts near to\r\nits origin than it does across districts which are far removed.\r\n\r\n3. The greater the intensity of the shock the greater is the velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n            EFFECTS PRODUCED BY EARTHQUAKES UPON BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n  The destruction of buildings is not irregular—Cracks in\r\n    buildings—Buildings in Tokio—Relation of destruction to\r\n    earthquake motion—Measurement of relative motion of parts of a\r\n    building shaken by an earthquake—Prevention of cracks—Direction\r\n    of cracks—The pitch of roofs—Relative position of openings in a\r\n    wall—The last house in a row—The swing of buildings—Principle of\r\n    relative vibrational periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this chapter is, from a practical point of view, one\r\nof the most important with which a seismologist has to deal. We\r\ncannot prevent the occurrence of earthquakes, and unless we avoid\r\nearthquake-shaken regions, we have not the means of escaping from\r\nthem. What we can do, however, is in some degree to protect ourselves.\r\nBy studying the effects produced by earthquakes upon buildings of\r\ndifferent construction and variously situated, we are taught how to\r\navoid or at least to mitigate calamities which, in certain regions of\r\nthe world, are continually repeated. The subject is an extensive one,\r\nand what is here said about it must be regarded only as a contribution\r\nto the work of future writers who may give it the attention it\r\ndeservedly requires.\r\n\r\n_The Destruction produced by Earthquakes is not irregular._—If we\r\nwere suddenly placed amongst the ruins of a large city which had\r\nbeen shattered by an earthquake, it is doubtful whether we should at\r\nonce recognise any law as to the relative position of the masses of\r\n_débris_ and the general destruction with which we are surrounded.\r\nThe results of observation have, however, shown us that, amongst the\r\napparently chaotic ruin produced by earthquakes, there is in many cases\r\nmore or less law governing the position of bodies which have fallen,\r\nthe direction and position of cracks in walls, and the various other\r\nphenomena which result from such destructive disturbances.\r\n\r\nMallet, at the commencement of his first volume, describing the\r\nNeapolitan earthquake of 1857, discusses the general effect produced by\r\nvarious shocks upon differently constructed buildings. First he shows\r\nthat, if we have a rectangular building, the walls at right angles to\r\nthe shock will be more likely to be overthrown than those which are\r\nparallel to it. Experience teaches a similar lesson. Thus Darwin, when\r\nspeaking of the earthquake at Concepcion in 1835,[20] tells us that\r\nthe town was built in the usual Spanish fashion, with all the streets\r\nrunning at right angles to each other. One set ranged S.W. by W. and\r\nN.E. by E. and the other N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. The walls in the\r\nformer direction certainly stood better than those in the latter. The\r\nundulations came from the S.W.\r\n\r\nIn Caraccas it is said that every house has its _laga securo_, or safe\r\nside, where the inhabitants place their fragile property. This _laga\r\nsecuro_ is the north side, and it was chosen because about two out of\r\nevery three destructive shocks traversed the city from west to east,\r\nso that the walls in these sides of a building have been stricken\r\nbroadside on.[21]\r\n\r\n_Cracks in Buildings._—Results like the above come from destructive\r\nearthquakes rather than from movements such as those we have to deal\r\nwith ordinarily. When a building is subjected to a slight movement\r\nit is assumed that the walls at right angles to the direction of the\r\nshock move backwards and forwards as a whole, and there is little or\r\nno tendency for them to be fractured at their weaker parts, these\r\nweaker parts being those over the various openings. The walls, however,\r\nwhich are parallel to the direction of the movement are, so to speak,\r\nextended and contracted along their length, and in consequence they may\r\nbe expected to give way over the various openings. This tendency for\r\nextension and contraction of a wall along its length may be supposed,\r\nfor instance, to be due to the different portions of a wall, owing to\r\ndifferences in dimensions and elasticity, having different periods of\r\nnatural vibration, or possibly for two portions of a long line of wall\r\nto be simultaneously affected by portions of waves in different phases.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the giving way of a building in the manner here\r\nsuggested we may take the case of a large brick structure which was\r\nrecently being erected in Tokio. This building, at the time of the\r\nearthquake, was only some fourteen or fifteen feet above the surface\r\nof the ground. The length of the building stretched from N.W. to S.E.,\r\nand it was intersected by many walls at right angles to this direction.\r\nThrough all the walls of this building there were many arched openings.\r\nIn the central part of the transverse walls, which walls were fully\r\nfive feet in thickness, the arches which joined them together were 4\r\nfeet 4 inches in thickness. The arches therefore formed a comparatively\r\nlightly constructed link between heavy masses of brickwork.\r\n\r\nOn March 3, 1879, at 4.43 P.M., an earthquake was felt throughout\r\nTokio, the strength of which, as judged by our feelings, was above that\r\nof an average shock. As registered by one of Palmieri’s instruments, it\r\nhad a direction S.S.W. to N.N.E. and an intensity of 11°. On the same\r\nday there were several smaller shocks having the same direction, and\r\nthese were succeeded by others on the 9th of the month.\r\n\r\nImmediately after these shakings it was discovered that almost every\r\narch in the internal walls of the building here referred to had been\r\ncracked across the crown in a direction about N. 40° W. All the\r\nother arches of the building, of which there were a great number in\r\nwalls at right angles to the direction of the shock, were found not\r\nto have sustained any injury. To this statement, however, there was\r\none exception, which was subsequently proved to have been due to a\r\nsettlement taking place.\r\n\r\nAfter examining these cracks the only cause to which they could be\r\nattributed was the series of shakings which they had just experienced.\r\nIt seemed as if the heavy walls right and left of the arches had been\r\nin vibration without synchronism in their periods, and as a consequence\r\nthe arches which connected them had been torn asunder.\r\n\r\nAlthough the time at which the cracks were formed and the peculiar\r\npositions in which they were only to be found pointed distinctly to\r\ntheir origin, to be certain that they were not due to settlement of the\r\nfoundations, horizontal lines were ruled upon the brickwork and from\r\ntime to time subsequently observed.\r\n\r\nThe points to which the various cracks extended were also marked and\r\nobserved. Beneath the walls as foundations there were beds of concrete\r\nabout three feet thick and about ten feet in width. These had been\r\nunder the pressure of the partially built walls for two years before\r\nthe arches had been put in. As these foundations were unusually strong,\r\nbeing intended to carry so very much greater weight than that to which\r\nthey had been subjected, if any settlement had been detected it would\r\nhave been a matter of surprise.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after the formation of these cracks it was observed that\r\nthey gradually closed. This was probably due to the gradual falling\r\ninwards of the two broken portions of the arch, their position when\r\nopen being one of instability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Cracks in a corner house, Belluno, June 29,\r\n1873 (Bittner).]\r\n\r\nHad this building been more complete at the time of the shock, and\r\nthe heavy walls been tied together at higher points, although the\r\narchways would have been points of weakness, it is quite possible\r\nthat fracture would not have taken place. This illustration shows us\r\nthat when a building is shaken in a definite direction there will be\r\nsome rule as to the positions in which fractures occur. As another\r\nexample, we may take the observations of Alexander Bittner upon the\r\nbuildings of Belluno after the shock of June 29, 1873 (see Beiträge\r\nzur Kenntniss des Erdbebens von Belluno am 29 Juni, 1873, p. 40. Von\r\nAlexander Bittner. Aus dem LXIX. Bande der Sitzungsb. der K. Akad. der\r\nWissensch., II. Abth., April-Heft. Jahrg. 1874).\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, he remarks that ‘Houses similarly situated have\r\nsuffered in corresponding walls and corners in a similar manner. In\r\nBelluno there is a certain kind of damage which is repeated everywhere,\r\nmaking a peculiar system of splits in the S.W. and N.E. corners of the\r\nhouses.’ This is well shown in the accompanying sketch, which evidently\r\nillustrates the effect of a shock oblique to the direction of two walls\r\nat right angles to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Brick buildings in Tokio, showing\r\nfractures.]\r\n\r\n_Buildings in Tokio._—For the purpose of finding out what has been the\r\neffect produced by earthquakes upon the buildings of Tokio, and at\r\nthe same time for ascertaining whether blocks of buildings ranging in\r\ndifferent directions suffered to the same extent, the author examined,\r\nin company with Mr. Josiah Conder, a large number of foreign-built\r\nhouses in the district of the Ginza. The chief reason for choosing\r\nthis was because it was the only district where a large number of\r\n_similar_ buildings could be found. By examining houses or buildings of\r\ndifferent constructions, the effects produced upon them by earthquakes\r\nare very often likely to show so many differences that it becomes\r\nalmost an impossibility to determine what the general effect has\r\nbeen—unsymmetrical construction involving unsymmetrical ruin.\r\n\r\nA number of similarly constructed buildings in one locality may be\r\nregarded as a number of seismographs, the effect upon any one of them\r\nbeing judged of by the average of the general effect which has been\r\nproduced upon the whole. The general form of two of these houses\r\nwhich were examined is shown in fig. 17. In this figure the general\r\ncharacter of the fractures which have been produced can also be seen.\r\nThe houses are built of brick, and are in many cases faced with a thin\r\ncoat of white plaster. Projecting from the level of the upper floor\r\nthere is a balcony fronted by a low balustrade. This is supported by\r\nsmall beams which at their outer extremity are carried on a row of\r\ncylindrical columns. This forms a covered way in front of each row of\r\nhouses. The roofs are covered with thick tiles. It will be observed\r\nthat the arches of the upper windows spring _sharply_ from their\r\nabutments, and at their crown they carry a heavy key-stone. The lower\r\nopenings, which have a span of 9 feet, have evidently been constructed\r\nin imitation of the open front of an ordinary Japanese house. These\r\narchways curve out _gently_ from their abutments. The outside walls\r\nhave a thickness of 13½ inches.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained from a careful examination of 174 houses in\r\nstreets running N.E. and 156 houses in streets running N.W., all of\r\nthese houses being similar, were as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. In the upper windows nearly all the cracks ran from the springing,\r\nwhich formed an angle with the abutment.\r\n\r\n2. In the lower arches, which _curved_ into the abutments, not a single\r\ncrack was observed at the springway. The cracks in these arches were\r\nnear the crown, where beams projected to carry the balcony. In many\r\ninstances the cracks proceeded from such beams, even if there were\r\nno arch beneath. That cracks should occur in peculiar positions, as\r\nis here indicated, is shown in the illustrations which accompany the\r\naccounts of many earthquakes.\r\n\r\n3. The houses which were most cracked were in the streets running\r\nparallel to the direction in which the greater number and most powerful\r\nset of shocks cross the city.\r\n\r\nThe results showed that, in order to avoid the effects of small shocks,\r\nall walls containing principal openings should be placed as nearly\r\nas possible at right angles to the direction in which the shocks of\r\nthe districts usually travel. The blank walls, or those containing\r\nunimportant openings, would then be parallel to the direction of the\r\nshocks—that is, presuming our building to be made up of two sets of\r\nwalls at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\nAnother point of importance would be to build archways _curving_ into\r\nthe supporting buttresses; the archways over doors and windows which we\r\nfind in earthquake countries do not appear to be in any way different\r\nfrom those which are built in countries free from earthquakes. In\r\nthe one country these structures have simply to withstand vertical\r\npressures applied statically; in the other, they have to withstand more\r\nor less horizontal stresses, applied suddenly.\r\n\r\n_Relation of Destruction to Earthquake Motion._—The relations which\r\nexist between the overturning and projection of bodies and the motion\r\nof the ground have already been discussed. It may be interesting\r\nto call attention to the fact that in the formulæ showing three\r\nrelationships, it was the _shape_ rather than the _weight_ of a body\r\nwhich determined whether it should be overturned or projected by a\r\nmotion at its base.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting proof that light bodies may be overturned as easily\r\nas heavy ones. Mallet refers to the overturning of several large\r\nhaystacks as one of the results of the Neapolitan earthquake.\r\n\r\nIf masses of material are displaced or fractured, then Mallet remarks\r\n                                       _____\r\nthat the maximum velocity will exceed √2_gh_, where _h_ is the\r\namplitude of the wave. Should the maximum velocity be less than this\r\nquantity, the masses which are acted upon will be simply raised and\r\nlowered, and there will be no relative displacements even if the\r\nemergence of the wave be nearly or quite vertical.\r\n\r\nWhen we get a vertical wave acting upon an irregular mass of masonry,\r\nthe heavier portions of the masonry, by their inertia, tend to descend\r\nrelatively to the remaining portions, and in this way vertical fissures\r\nwill be produced. For this reason it would not be advisable to use\r\nheavy materials above archways, heavy roofs, or heavy floors. The\r\nvertical fissures, Mallet remarks, would have their widest opening at\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\nIn considering cases of fracture produced by earthquake motion, it\r\nmust be remembered that these are due to stresses applied _suddenly_,\r\nand that if the same amount of stress had been _slowly_ applied to a\r\nbuilding, fractures might not have occurred.\r\n\r\nIf a disturbance is horizontal, and has a direction parallel to the\r\nlength of a wall, the wall is carried forward at its foundations. This\r\nmotion is opposed by the inertia of the upper portion of the wall and\r\nthe various loads it carries. The wall being elastic, distortion takes\r\nplace, and cracks, which are widest at the top, will be formed. In a\r\nuniform wall the two most prominent fissures ought to be near the ends.\r\n\r\nIf the horizontal backward and forward movement has a direction\r\noblique to the plane of the wall, the wall will be either overthrown,\r\nfractured, or have a triangular fragment thrown off towards the origin\r\nfrom the end last reached.\r\n\r\nShould the wave emerge steeply, diagonal fissures at right angles to\r\nthe direction of transit will be formed, or else triangular pieces will\r\nbe projected.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figures are reduced from Mallet’s ‘Account of the\r\nNeapolitan Earthquake of 1857.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Cathedral Church, Potenza (Mallet).]\r\n\r\nTaking _a_ _b_ as the general direction of the fractures in fig. 18,\r\nthen _c_ _d_ will represent the direction in which the shock emerged,\r\nwhich is at an angle of 23°·20′ to the horizon. It might be argued that\r\nthe direction of these fractures was due to the direction in which\r\nsurface undulations had travelled, or to the relative strengths and\r\nproportions of different portions of the building. The directions of\r\ncracks in a building are undoubtedly due to a complexity of causes, but\r\nfor buildings situated in the region of shock the impulsive effect of\r\nthe shock is probably the most important function to be considered.\r\nThe method of applying the directions of emergence, deduced from\r\nobservations on fractures, to determine the origin of a disturbance\r\nwill be referred to in Chapter X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—The Cathedral, Paterno (Mallet).\r\nNeapolitan Earthquake of 1857.]\r\n\r\nMallet observed that, although two ends of a building might be nearly\r\nthe same, the fissures and joints do not occur at equal distances from\r\nthe ends, nor are they equally opened.\r\n\r\nThe end where the joints are the most opened is that which was first\r\nacted upon, and this phenomenon may be sufficiently well pronounced\r\nto indicate the direction in which we must look to find the origin\r\nof a disturbance. Amongst possible explanations for this disposition\r\nof fractures in a wall. Mallet suggests that they may be due to real\r\ndifferences in the two semiphases of the wave of shock, the second\r\nsemiphase being described with a somewhat slower velocity than the\r\nfirst. This, it will be observed, is contrary to the indications of\r\nseismographs.\r\n\r\nFig. 19, of the cathedral at Paterno, shows the effect of a subnormal\r\nshock striking a wall obliquely and projecting one of its corners.\r\n\r\n\r\n           MEASUREMENTS OF THE RELATIVE MOTION OF PARTS OF A\r\n                BUILDING AT THE TIME OF AN EARTHQUAKE.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 a series of observations was made in Tokio to determine whether\r\nat the time of an earthquake the various parts of the arched openings\r\nwhich we see in many buildings synchronised in their vibrations, or,\r\nfor want of synchronism, were caused to approach and recede from each\r\nother. The arches experimented on were heavy brick arches forming the\r\ntwo corridors of the Imperial College of Engineering. The direction of\r\none set of these corridors is N. 40° E. and that of the other N. 50° W.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the walls in which these arches are placed is 1 ft.\r\n11 in. They are built of Japanese bricks bound together with ordinary\r\nlime. The span of the arches is 8 ft. 3 in., and the height of the arch\r\nfrom the springing-line to the crown 4 ft. 1 in. The height of the\r\nabutments is 7 ft. 1½ in. The voussoirs of the arch are formed of a\r\nlight grey soft volcanic rock, and on their faces show a depth of 12\r\ninches. The width of the intermediate columns between the arches is 4\r\nft. 6⅞ in.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether at the time of an earthquake there was any\r\nvariation in the dimensions of these arches, a light stiff deal\r\nrod, about 2 in. by ½ in. in cross section, was placed across the\r\nspringing-line of the arch. One end of this was firmly fixed to the\r\ntop of one abutment by means of a spike; on the other end, which was\r\nto indicate any horizontal movement if the abutments approached each\r\nother, there was fixed a pointer made out of a piece of steel wire.\r\nThis rested on a piece of smoked glass fixed to the ledge on which\r\nthe loose end of the rod was resting. If the abutments approached or\r\nreceded from each other a line would be drawn measuring the extent of\r\nthe motion. As a further indication of motion, a second smoked glass\r\nplate was fixed on the transverse rod, which plate was marked on by a\r\npointer attached to a vertical rod hanging down from the crown of the\r\narch.\r\n\r\nAs a general result of these experiments it may be said that the\r\nportions of the building which were examined usually either did not\r\nmove at all, or else they practically synchronised in their movements.\r\nWhen they did move, the extent of motion was small, and the small\r\ndifferences in movement which were observed were in every probability\r\nfar within the elastic limits of the structure.\r\n\r\n_Observations on Cracks._—To determine whether the walls of a building\r\nwhich have once been cracked, when subjected to a series of shocks,\r\nsimilar to those which they experienced before being cracked, still\r\ncontinued to give way, the extremities of a considerable number of\r\ncracks in the N.E. end of the museum buildings of the Engineering\r\nCollege were marked with pencil. Although since the time of marking\r\nthere had been many severe shocks, these cracks did not visibly extend.\r\nThese marks were made on the outside wall of the building. On the\r\ninside, one of these same cracks showed itself as a fissure about ¼\r\ninch in width. Across this crack a horizontal steel wire pointer was\r\nplaced. One end of this wire was fixed in the wall; the other end,\r\nwhich was pointed, rested on the surface of a smoked glass plate placed\r\non the other side of the crack. After small earthquakes there was no\r\nindication of motion having taken place, but after a shock on February\r\n21, as indicated by a line upon the smoked glass plate, it was seen\r\nthat the sides of the crack had approached and receded from each other\r\nthrough a distance of about 1/16 inch.\r\n\r\nBy similar contrivances placed on cracks in a neighbouring building\r\nexactly similar results were obtained, namely, that during small\r\nearthquakes the two sides of the crack had retained their relative\r\npositions, but at the time of a large shock this position had been\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nIn this building it was also observed that the cracks in many instances\r\nincreased their length.\r\n\r\nBy attaching levers to the end of the pointers to multiply any motion\r\nthat might take place, no doubt the indications would be more frequent\r\nand more definite. It would also be easier to note the relative\r\ndistances of motion in two directions, namely, how far the cracks\r\nhad closed and how far they had opened. As to whether motion would\r\noccur or not, much would no doubt depend upon the direction of the\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n_Prevention of Fractures._—One conclusion which may perhaps be drawn\r\nfrom these observations is, that a cracked building at the time of an\r\nearthquake shows a certain amount of flexibility. Whether a building\r\nwhich had been designed with cracks or joints between those parts\r\nwhich were likely to have different periods of vibration would be more\r\nstable, so far as earthquake shakings are concerned, than a similar\r\nbuilding put up in an ordinary manner, is a matter to be decided by\r\nexperiment. Certainly some of the cracks which have been examined\r\nindicate that if they had not existed, the strain upon the portion of\r\nthe building where they occur would have been extremely great.\r\n\r\n_Direction of Cracks._—In looking at the cracks produced by small\r\nearthquakes it is interesting to note the manner of their extension.\r\nThe basements of the buildings which have been most carefully examined\r\nare, for a height of two or three feet, built of large rectangular\r\nblocks of a greyish-coloured volcanic rock. In these parts the cracks\r\npass in and out between the joints of the stone, indicating that\r\nthe stones have evidently been stronger than the mortar which bound\r\nthem together, and as a consequence the latter had to give way.\r\nAbove this basement when the cracks enter the brickwork, they no\r\nlonger exclusively confine themselves to the joints, but run in an\r\nirregular line through all they meet with, sometimes across the bricks\r\nand sometimes through the mortar joints. In places where they have\r\ntraversed the brickwork, we can say that the mortar has been stronger\r\nthan the bricks. This traversing of the bricks rather than the joints\r\nis, I think, the general rule for the direction of the cracks in the\r\nbrickwork of Tokio buildings.\r\n\r\n_The Pitch of Roofs._—From observation of the effects produced by\r\nearthquakes, it appears to us that the houses which lost the greater\r\nnumber of tiles appear to be those with the steepest pitch, and those\r\nwhere the tiles were simply laid upon the roof and not in any manner\r\nfastened down. It would seem that destruction of this sort might to a\r\ngreat extent be obviated by giving the roofs a less inclination and\r\nfixing the tiles with nails. It was also noticed that the greatest\r\ndisturbance amongst the tiles was upon the ridges of the roofs.\r\nDestruction of this sort might be overcome by giving especial attention\r\nto these portions during the construction of the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:  FIG. 20.      FIG.  21.]\r\n\r\n_Relative Position of Openings in Walls._—From what has been said about\r\nthe fractures in the buildings of Tokio it will have been seen that,\r\nwith but few exceptions, they have all taken place above openings\r\nlike doorways and windows. If architecture demands that openings like\r\narches should be placed one above another in heavy walls of this kind,\r\nas in fig. 17, there will be lines of weakness running through the\r\nopenings parallel to the dotted lines. As arches are only intended\r\nto resist vertical thrusts, special construction must be adopted to\r\nmake them strong enough to resist horizontal pulls. For instance, a\r\nflat arch would offer more resistance to horizontal pulls than an\r\narch put together with ordinary voussoirs, there being in the former\r\ncase more friction to prevent the component parts sliding over each\r\nother. Or again, above each arch an iron girder or wooden lintel might\r\nbe inserted in the brick or stone arch. It was suggested to me by my\r\ncolleague, Mr. Perry, that the best form calculated to give a wall\r\nuniform strength, would be to build it so that the openings of each\r\ntier would occupy alternate positions, that is to say, along lines\r\nparallel to the struts and ties of a girder. In this way we should have\r\nour materials so arranged that they would offer the same resistance to\r\nhorizontal as to vertical movements. Such a wall is shown in fig. 20:\r\nthe dotted lines running through the openings, and all similar lines\r\nparallel to the former, representing lines of weakness. If we compare\r\nthis with fig. 21, we shall see that in the case of a horizontal\r\nmovement _a_ _b_ or of a vertical movement _c_ _d_, we should rather\r\nexpect to find fractures in a house built like fig. 21 than in one\r\nbuilt like fig. 20. If, however, these two buildings were shaken by a\r\nshock which had an angle of emergence of about 45° in the direction _e_\r\n_f_, the effects might be reversed. Usually, however, and always in a\r\ntown like Tokio which is visited by shocks originating at a distance,\r\nthe movements are practically horizontal ones, and, therefore,\r\nbuildings erected on the principles illustrated by fig. 20 should\r\nbe much superior, so far as resisting earthquakes is concerned, to\r\nbuildings constructed in the ordinary manner, as in fig. 21. Fractures\r\nfollowing a vertical line of weakness are shown in the accompanying\r\ndrawing, fig. 22, of the Church of St. Augustin, at Manilla, shattered\r\nby the earthquakes of 1880.\r\n\r\n_The last House in a Row._—When an earthquake shock enters a line\r\nof buildings, and proceeds in a direction coincident with that of\r\nthe buildings, we should expect that the last of these houses, being\r\nunsupported on one side, would be in the position of the last person in\r\nTyndall’s row of boys. From this it would seem that the end house in a\r\nrow would show the greatest tendency to fly away from its neighbours.\r\nIf the last house stood upon the edge of a deep canal or a cliff,\r\nthere would be a layer of ground, equal in thickness to the depth of\r\nthe canal or to the height of the cliff, as the case may be, which\r\nwould also be in a position to be thrown forward. The effect which is\r\nsometimes produced upon an end building is shown in fig. 23, which is\r\ntaken from the photograph of a house shattered in 1868 at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Church of St. Augustin, Manilla.\r\nEarthquakes of July 18–20, 1880.]\r\n\r\n_The Swing of Buildings._—The distance through which buildings are\r\nmoved at the time of an earthquake depends partly on their construction\r\nand partly on the extent, nature, and duration of the movement\r\ncommunicated to them at their foundations. By violent shocks buildings\r\nmay be completely overthrown. In the case of small earthquakes, the\r\nupper portion of a house may frequently move through a much greater\r\ndistance than the ground at its foundation. For instance, during the\r\nYokohama earthquake of February, 1880, when the maximum amplitude of\r\nthe earth’s motion was probably under ¾ of an inch, from the slow swing\r\nof long Japanese pictures, from three to six feet in length, which\r\noscillated backwards and forwards on the wall, it is very probable\r\nthat the extent through which the upper portion of houses moved was\r\nvery considerable. In some instances these pictures seem to have swung\r\nas much as two feet, and from the manner in which they swung they\r\nevidently synchronised with the natural swing of the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Webber House, San Francisco. Oct. 21, 1868.]\r\n\r\nFrom this it would seem that such a house must have rocked from side to\r\nside one foot out of its normal perpendicular position. That the motion\r\nwas great is testified by nearly all who tried to stand at the time of\r\nthe shock, it having been impossible to walk steadily across the floor\r\nof a room in an upper story. The houses here referred to are either\r\nthose which are purely Japanese, or else those which are framed of wood\r\nand built on European models, a class of building which is very common\r\nin Tokio and Yokohama.\r\n\r\nPerry and Ayrton calculated the period of a complete natural vibration\r\nof different structures. For a square house whose outer and inner\r\nsections were respectively 30 and 26 feet, and whose height was 30\r\nfeet, the period calculated would be about ·06 second.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the above earthquake many houses seem to have moved like\r\ninverted pendulums. On the morning after the shock my neighbour, who\r\nwas living upstairs in a tall wooden house with a tile roof, told me\r\nthat he endeavoured to count the vibrations, and was of the impression\r\nthat to make a complete swing it took about 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nAssuming now that the distance through which the top of a wooden house\r\nmoved was about 1 foot, and the number of vibrations which it made per\r\nsecond was about ·5, then the greatest velocity of a point on the top\r\nof such a house must have been about 6 feet per second.\r\n\r\nMallet, who made observations upon the vibrations of various\r\nstructures, tells us that Salisbury spire moves to and fro in a gale\r\nmore than 3 inches. A well-constructed brick and mortar wall, 40 feet\r\nhigh and 1 foot 6 inches thick, was observed to vibrate in a gale 2\r\nfeet transversely before it fell.\r\n\r\nAn octagonal chimney with a heavy granite capping, 160 feet high, was\r\nobserved instrumentally to vibrate at the top nearly 5 inches.[22]\r\n\r\nAt the time of a severe earthquake it does not seem impossible but that\r\na building may be swung completely over. The accompanying illustration,\r\nfig. 24, taken from a photograph,[23] apparently indicates a movement\r\nof description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—Stud Mill at Haywards, California. Oct. 21,\r\n1868.]\r\n\r\n_Principle of relative Vibrational Period._—If a lath or thin pole\r\nloaded at one end with a weight fixed to the ground, so as to stand\r\nvertically, be shaken by an earthquake it will be caused to rock to\r\nand fro like an inverted pendulum. The period of its swing will be\r\nchiefly dependent on its dimensions, its elasticity, and its load. In\r\na building we have to consider the vibration of a number of parts,\r\nthe periods of which, if they were independent of each other, would be\r\ndifferent. On account of this difference in period, whilst one portion\r\nof a building is endeavouring to move towards the right, another\r\nis pulling towards the left, and, in consequence, either the bonds\r\nwhich join them or else they themselves are strained or broken. This\r\nwas strikingly illustrated by many of the chimneys in the houses at\r\nYokohama, which by the earthquake of February 20, 1880, were shorn off\r\njust above the roof. The chimneys were shafts of brick, and probably\r\nhad a slower period of vibration than the roof through which they\r\npassed, this latter vibrating with the main portion of the house, which\r\nwas framed of wood.\r\n\r\nA particularly instructive example of this kind which came under my\r\nnotice is roughly sketched in fig. 25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nThis is a chimney standing alone, which, for the sake of support, was\r\nstrapped by an iron band to an adjoining building. It would seem that\r\nat the time of the shock, the building moving one way and the chimney\r\nanother, the swing of the heavy building gave the chimney a sharp jerk\r\nand cut it off. The upper portion, being then loose upon the lower\r\npart, rotated under the influence of the oscillations in manner similar\r\nto that in which gravestones are rotated.\r\n\r\nMallet made observations similar to these in Italy. He tells us that a\r\nbuttress may often not have time to transmit its stability to a wall.\r\nThe wall and the buttress have different periods of vibration, and\r\ntherefore they exert impulsive actions on each other. Effects like\r\nthese were strikingly observable in many of the rural Italian churches\r\nwhere the belfry tower is built into one of the quoins of the main\r\nrectangular building.\r\n\r\nNot only have we to consider the relative vibrations of the various\r\nparts of a building amongst themselves, but we have to consider the\r\nrelation of the natural vibrations of any one of them or the vibration\r\nof the building as a whole, with regard to the earth, the vibrations of\r\nwhich it must be remembered are not strictly periodic.\r\n\r\nSome of the more important results dependent upon the principle of\r\n‘relative vibrational periods’ may be understood from the following\r\nexperiments:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 26 A, B, and C are three flat springs made out of strips of\r\nbamboo, and loaded at the top with pieces of lead. At the bottom they\r\nare fixed into a piece of board D E, and the whole rests on a table F\r\nG. The legs of this table being slightly loose, by placing the fingers\r\non the top of it, a quick short backward and forward movement can be\r\nproduced. The weights on A and B are the same, but they are larger than\r\nthe weight on C. Consequently the periods of A and B are the same, but\r\ndifferent to the period of C. The dimensions of these springs are as\r\nfollows: height, 18 inches; A and B each carry weights equal to 320\r\ngrammes, and they make one vibration per second; C has a weight of 199\r\ngrammes, and makes 0·75 vibrations per second.\r\n\r\n_First Experiment._—It will be found that by giving the table a gentle\r\nbackward and forward movement, the extent of which movement may be so\r\nsmall that it will be difficult to detect it with the eye, either A\r\nand B may be made to oscillate violently whilst C remains still; or\r\n_vice versâ_, C may be caused to oscillate whilst A and B remain still.\r\nIn the one case the period of shaking will have been synchronous with\r\nthe natural period of A and B, whilst in the latter it will have been\r\nsynchronous with that of C. This would seem to show us that if the\r\nnatural period of vibration of a house, or of parts of it, at any time\r\nagree with the period of the shock, it may be readily thrown into a\r\nstate of oscillation which will be dangerous for its safety.\r\n\r\n_Second Experiment._—Bind A and B together with a strip of paper\r\npasted between them. (The paper used was three-eighths of an inch\r\nbroad and would carry a weight of nearly three pounds.) If the table\r\nbe now shaken as before, A and B will always have similar movements,\r\nand tend to remain at the same distance apart, and as a consequence\r\nthe strip of paper will not be broken. From this experiment it would\r\nseem that so long as the different portions of a building have almost\r\nthe same periods of vibration, there will be little or no strain upon\r\nthe tie-rods or whatever contrivance may be used in connecting the\r\ndifferent parts.\r\n\r\n_Third Experiment._—Join A and C, or B and C with a strip of paper in a\r\nmanner similar to the last experiment. If the table be now shaken with\r\na period approximating either to that of A and B, or with that of C,\r\nthe paper will be suddenly snapped.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that if we have different portions of a building of\r\nsuch heights and thicknesses that their natural periods of vibration\r\nare different, the strain upon the portions which connect such parts\r\nis enormous, and it would seem, as a consequence, that either the\r\nvibrators themselves, or else their connections, must, of a necessity,\r\ngive way. This was very forcibly illustrated in the Yokohama earthquake\r\nof February 1880 by the knocking over of chimneys. The particular case\r\nof the chimneys is, however, better illustrated by the next experiment.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Experiment._—Take a little block of wood three-quarters of an\r\ninch square and about one inch high, and place it on the top of A, B,\r\nor C. It will be found that, although the spring on which it stands\r\nis caused to swing backwards and forwards through a distance of three\r\ninches, the little block will retain its position.\r\n\r\nThis little block we may regard as the upper part of a chimney standing\r\non a vibrating stack, and we see that, so long as this upper portion is\r\nlight, it has no tendency to fall.\r\n\r\n_Fifth Experiment._—Repeat the fourth experiment, having first placed a\r\nsmall leaden cap on the top of the block representing the chimney. (The\r\ncap used only weighed a few grammes.) When vibration commences it will\r\nbe found that the block quickly falls. This would seem to indicate that\r\nchimneys with heavy tops are more likely to fall than light ones.\r\n\r\n_Sixth Experiment._—Bind A and B together with a strip of paper and\r\nstand the little block upon the top of either. It will be found that\r\nthe block will stand as in the fourth experiment.\r\n\r\n_Seventh Experiment._—Bind A and C, or B and C together, and place\r\nthe block upon the top of either of them. When vibration commences,\r\nalthough the paper may not be broken, the little block will quickly\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n_Eighth Experiment._—Take two pencils or pieces of glass tube and\r\nplace them under the board D E. If the table F G be now shaken in the\r\ndirection D E, it will be found that the springs will not vibrate.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner if a house or portion of a house were carried on\r\nballs or rollers, as has already been suggested, it would seem that the\r\nhouse might be saved from much vibration.\r\n\r\n_Ninth Experiment._—Set any of the springs in violent vibration by\r\ngently shaking D E instead of the table, and then suddenly cease the\r\nactuating motion. It will be observed that at the moment of cessation\r\nthe board and the springs will have a sudden and very decided motion\r\nof translation in the same direction as that in which the springs were\r\nlast moving, and although the springs were at the time swinging through\r\na considerable arc, all motion will suddenly cease.\r\n\r\nThis shows, that if a house is in a state of vibration the strain at\r\nthe foundations must be very great.\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to devise other experiments to illustrate\r\nother phenomena connected with the principle of relative vibrational\r\nperiods, but these may perhaps be sufficient to show to those who have\r\nnot considered this matter its great importance in the construction\r\nof buildings. Perhaps the greater portion of what is here said may by\r\nmany be regarded as self-evident truisms hardly worth the trouble of\r\ndemonstration. Their importance, however, seems to be so great that I\r\nhope that their discussion has not been altogether out of place.\r\n\r\nI may remark that in the rebuilding of chimneys in Yokohama the\r\nprinciples here enunciated were taken advantage of by allowing the\r\nchimneys to pass freely through the roofs without coming in contact\r\nwith any of the main timbers.\r\n\r\nIn putting up buildings to resist the effects of an earthquake, besides\r\nthe idea of making everything strong because the earthquake is strong,\r\nthere are several principles which, like the one just enunciated, might\r\nadvantageously be followed which as yet appear to have received but\r\nlittle attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n             EFFECTS PRODUCED UPON BUILDINGS (continued).\r\n\r\n  Types of buildings used in earthquake countries—In Japan, in Italy,\r\n    in South America, in Caraccas—Typical houses for earthquake\r\n    countries—Destruction due to the nature of underlying rocks—The\r\n    swing of mountains—Want of support on the face of hills—Earthquake\r\n    shadows—Destruction due to the interference of waves—Earthquake\r\n    bridges—Examples of earthquake effects—Protection of\r\n    buildings—General conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Types of buildings used in earthquake countries._—In Japan there\r\nare excellent opportunities of studying various types of buildings.\r\nThe Japanese types, of course, form the majority of the buildings.\r\nThe ordinary Japanese house consists of a light framework of 4 or\r\n5 inch scantling, built together without struts or ties, all the\r\ntimbers crossing each other at right angles. The spaces are filled\r\nin with wattle-work of bamboo, and this is plastered over with mud.\r\nThis construction stands on the top of a row of boulders or of square\r\nstones, driven into the surface soil to a distance varying from a few\r\ninches to a foot. The whole arrangement is so light that it is not an\r\nuncommon thing to see a large house rolled along from one position to\r\nanother on wooden rollers. In buildings such as these after a series of\r\nsmall earthquake shocks, we could hardly expect to find more fractures\r\nthan in a wicker basket.\r\n\r\nThe larger buildings, such as temples and pagodas, are also built of\r\ntimber. These are built up of such a multitude of pieces and framed\r\ntogether in such an intricate manner that they also are capable of\r\nyielding in all directions. The European buildings are, of course,\r\nmade of brick and stone with mortar joints. Some of these, as the\r\nbuildings of the Ginza in Tokio, are not designed for great strength.\r\nOn the other hand, others have thick and massive walls and are equal in\r\nstrength to those we find in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe third type of buildings are those which are built in blocks; and\r\nthese blocks being bound together with iron rods traversing the walls\r\nin various directions are especially designed to withstand earthquakes.\r\nA system somewhat similar to this has been patented in America, and\r\nexamples of these so-called earthquake-proof buildings are to be found\r\nin San Francisco.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Japanese buildings, Mr. R. H. Brunton, who has devoted\r\nespecial attention to them says that,[24] ‘to imagine that slight\r\nbuildings, such as are seen here (i.e. in Japan), are the best\r\ncalculated to withstand an earthquake shock is an error of the most\r\npalpable kind.’ After describing the construction of a Japanese house\r\nin pretty much the same terms as we have used, he says ‘that with its\r\nunnecessarily heavy roof and weak framework it is a structure of all\r\nothers the worst adapted to withstand a heavy shock.’ He tells us,\r\nfurther, that these views are sustained by the truest principles of\r\nmechanics. In order to render buildings to some extent proof against\r\nearthquakes, some of the heavy roofs in Tokio have been so constructed\r\nthat they are capable of sliding on the walls. Mr. Brunton mentions\r\na design for a house, the upper part of which is to rest on balls,\r\nwhich roll on inverted cups fixed on the lower part of the building,\r\nwhich is to be firmly embedded in the earth. A similar design was,\r\nat the suggestion of Mallet, used to support the tables carrying the\r\napparatus of some of the lighthouses erected in Japan by Mr. Brunton.\r\nThe very existence of these designs seems to indicate that the ordinary\r\nEuropean house, however solidly and strongly it may be built, is not\r\nsufficient to meet the conditions imposed upon it. What is required,\r\nis something that will give way—an approximation to the timber frame\r\nof a Japanese house, so strongly condemned by Mr. Brunton and others.\r\nThe crucial test of the value of the Japanese structure, as compared\r\nwith the modern buildings of brick and stone, is undoubtedly to be\r\nfound by an appeal to the buildings themselves. So far as my own\r\nexperience has gone, I must say that I have never seen any signs in\r\nthe Japanese timber buildings which could be attributed to the effects\r\nof earthquakes, and His Excellency Yamao Yozo, Vice Minister of Public\r\nWorks, who has made the study of the buildings of Japan a speciality,\r\ntold me that none of the temples and palaces, although many of them\r\nare several centuries old, and although they have been shaken by small\r\nearthquakes and also by many severe ones, show any signs of having\r\nsuffered. The greatest damage wrought by large earthquakes appears to\r\nhave resulted from the influx of large waves or from fires. In every\r\ncase where an earthquake has been accompanied by great destruction,\r\nby consulting the books describing the same, it can be seen, from the\r\nillustrations in these books portraying conflagrations, that this\r\ndestruction was chiefly due to fire. When we remember that nearly\r\nall Japanese houses are constructed of materials that are readily\r\ninflammable, it is not hard to imagine how destruction of this kind\r\nhas come about. To a Japanese, living as he does in a house which has\r\nbeen compared to a tinder-box, fire is one of his greatest enemies,\r\nand in a city like Tokio it is not at all uncommon to see during the\r\nwinter months many fires which sweep away from 100 to 500 houses. In\r\none winter I was a spectator of three fires, each of which was said to\r\nhave destroyed upwards of 10,000 houses.\r\n\r\nAlthough it would appear that the smaller earthquakes of Japan produce\r\nno visible effect upon the native buildings, it is nevertheless\r\nprobable that small effects may have been produced, the observation\r\nof which is rendered difficult by the nature of the structure. If we\r\nlook at buildings of foreign construction, by which are meant buildings\r\nof brick and stone, the picture before us is quite different, and\r\neverywhere the effects of earthquakes are palpable even to the most\r\ncasual observer. Of these effects numerous examples have already been\r\ngiven. Not only are these buildings damaged by the cracking of walls\r\nand the overturning of chimneys, but they also appear to be affected\r\ninternally. For instance, in the timbers of the roof of the museum\r\nattached to the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokio, there are a\r\nnumber of diagonal faces acting as struts or ties intended to prevent\r\nmore or less horizontal movements taking place. Those which are rigidly\r\njoined together with bolts and angle irons have apparently suffered\r\nfrom their rigidity, being twisted and bent into various forms. The\r\nbuildings in Tokio, which are strongly put together, being especially\r\ndesigned to withstand earthquakes, appear to have suffered but little.\r\nI know only one example which at the time of the severe shock of 1880\r\nhad several of its chimneys damaged.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary houses in Italy, though built of stone and mortar, are\r\nbut poorly put together, and, as Mallet has remarked, are in no way\r\nadapted to withstand the frightful shakings to which they are subjected\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nIn the large towns, like Naples, Rome, and Florence, where happily\r\nearthquakes are of rare occurrence, although the building may be\r\nbetter than that found in the country, the height of the houses and\r\nthe narrowness of the streets are sufficient to create a shudder, when\r\nwe think of the possibility of the occurrence of a moderately severe\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nIn South America, although many buildings are built with brick\r\nand stone, the ordinary houses, and even the larger edifices, are\r\nspecially built to withstand earthquakes. In Mr. James Douglas’s\r\naccount of a ‘Journey Along the West Coast of South America,’ we read\r\nthe following[25]: ‘The characteristic building material of Guayaquil\r\nis bamboo, which grows to many inches in thickness, and which, when\r\ncut partially through longitudinally at distances of an inch or so,\r\nand once quite through, can be opened out into fine elastic boards of\r\nserviceable width. Houses, and even churches, of a certain primitive\r\nbeauty are built of such reeds, so bound together with cords that few\r\nnails enter into the construction, and which, therefore, yield so\r\nreadily to the contortions of the earth during an earthquake as to be\r\ncomparatively safe.’\r\n\r\nHere we have a house, which, so far as earthquakes are concerned, is\r\nan exaggerated example of the principles which are followed in the\r\nconstruction of an ordinary Japanese dwelling.\r\n\r\nAnother plan adopted in South America can be gathered from the same\r\nauthor’s writings upon Lima, about which he says, ‘To build high houses\r\nwould be to erect structures for the first earthquake to make sport of,\r\nand, therefore, in order to obtain space, safety, and comfort, the\r\nhouses of the wealthy surround court after court, filled with flowers,\r\nand cooled with fountains, connected one with another with wide\r\npassages which give a vista from garden to garden.’\r\n\r\nHistory would indicate that houses of this type have been arrived at as\r\nthe results of experience, for it is said that when the inhabitants of\r\nSouth America first saw the Spaniards building tall houses, they told\r\nthem they were building their own sepulchres.[26]\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica, we find that even as early as 1692 experience had taught\r\nthe Spaniards to construct low houses, which withstood shakings better\r\nthan the tall ones.[27]\r\n\r\nIn Caraccas, which has been called the city of earthquakes, it is\r\nsaid that the earthquakes cause an average yearly damage amounting to\r\nthe equivalent of a _per capita_ tax of four dollars. To reduce this\r\nimpost to a minimum much attention is paid to construction. ‘Projecting\r\nbasement corners (giving the house a slightly pyramidal appearance)\r\nhave been found better than absolutely perpendicular walls; mortised\r\ncorner-stones and roof beams have saved many lives when the central\r\nwalls have split from top to bottom; vaults and key-stone arches, no\r\nmatter how massive, are more perilous than common wooden lintels, and\r\nthere are not many isolated buildings in the city. In many streets\r\nbroad iron girders, riveted to the wall, about a foot above the house\r\ndoor, run from house to house along the front of an entire square.\r\nTurret-like brick chimneys, with iron top ornaments, would expose the\r\narchitect to the vengeance of an excited mob; the roofs are flat,\r\nor flat terraced; the chimney flues terminate near the eaves in a\r\nperforated lid.’[28]\r\n\r\n_Typical houses for earthquake countries._—From what has now been said\r\nabout the different buildings found in earthquake countries, it will be\r\nseen that if we wish to put up a building able to withstand a severe\r\nshaking, we have before us structures of two types. One of these types\r\nmay be compared with a steel box, which, even were it rolled down a\r\nhigh mountain, would suffer but little damage; and the other, with a\r\nwicker basket, which would equally withstand so severe a test. Both\r\nof these types may be, to some extent, protected by placing them upon\r\na loose foundation, so that but little momentum enters them at their\r\nbase. One suggestion is to place a building upon iron balls. Another\r\nmethod would be to place them upon two sets of rollers, one set resting\r\nupon the other set at right angles. The Japanese, we have seen, place\r\ntheir houses on round stones. The solid type of building is expensive,\r\nand can only be approached partially, whilst the latter is cheap, and\r\ncan be approached closely. In the case of a solid building it would be\r\na more difficult matter to support it upon a movable foundation than in\r\nthe case of a light framework. Such a building is usually firmly fixed\r\non the ground, and consequently at the time of an earthquake, as has\r\nalready been shown by experiment, must be subjected to stresses which\r\nare very great. In consequence also of the greater weight of the solid\r\nstructure, more momentum will enter it at its base than in the case of\r\nthe light structure. Also, we must remember that the rigidity favours\r\nthe transmission of momentum, and with rigid walls we are likely to\r\nhave ornaments, coping-stones, and the comparatively freer portions\r\nforming the upper part of a building displaced; whilst, with flexible\r\nwalls absorbing momentum in the friction of their various parts, such\r\ndisturbances would not be so likely. Mr. T. Ronaldson, referring to\r\nthis, says, that in 1868, at San Francisco, the ornamental stone work\r\nin stone and cement buildings was thrown from its position, whilst\r\nsimilar ornaments in neighbouring brick buildings stood.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the top weight of a building, hollow bricks might be\r\nemployed. To render a building more homogeneous and elastic, the\r\nthickness of bricks might be reduced. Inasmuch as the elasticity\r\nof brick and timber are so different, the two ought to be employed\r\nseparately. For internal decorations plaster mouldings might be\r\nreplaced by _papier mâché_ and _carton-pierre_, the elastic yielding of\r\nwhich is comparatively great.[29] Houses, whether of brick and stone,\r\nor of timber, ought to be broad and low, and the streets three or four\r\ntimes as wide as the houses. The flatter the roofs the better.\r\n\r\nOne of the safest houses for an earthquake country would probably be a\r\none-storied strongly framed timber house, with a light flattish roof\r\nmade of shingles or sheet-iron, the whole resting on a quantity of\r\nsmall cast-iron balls carried on flat plates bedded in the foundations.\r\nThe chimneys might be made of sheet-iron carried through holes free of\r\nthe roof. The ornamentation ought to be of light materials.\r\n\r\nAt the time of severe earthquakes many persons seek refuge from their\r\nhouses by leaving them. In this case accidents frequently happen from\r\nthe falling of bricks and tiles. Others rush to the doorways and\r\nstand beneath the lintels. Persons with whom the author has conversed\r\nhave suggested that strongly constructed tables and bedsteads in\r\ntheir rooms would give protection. To see persons darting beneath\r\ntables and bedsteads would undoubtedly give rise to humiliating and\r\nludicrous exhibitions. This latter idea is not without a value, and\r\nmost certainly, if applied in houses of the type described, would be\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe great danger of fire may partially be obviated by: the use of\r\n‘earthquake lamps,’ which are so constructed that before they overturn\r\nthey are extinguished. It is said that in South America some of the\r\ninhabitants are ready at any moment to seek refuge in the streets,\r\nand they have coats prepared, stocked with provisions and; other\r\nnecessaries, which, if occasion demands, will enable them to spend the\r\nnight in the open air. These coats, called ‘earthquake coats,’ might\r\nalso, with properly constructed houses, be rendered unnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Destruction due to the nature of the underlying rocks._—That the\r\nnature of the ground on which a building stands is intimately related\r\nwith the severity of the blow it receives is a fact which has often\r\nbeen demonstrated.\r\n\r\nOne cause of destruction is due to placing a building on foundations\r\nwhich are capable of receiving the full effects of a shock, and\r\ntransmitting it to the buildings standing on them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the reason why a soft bed might possibly make a good\r\nfoundation, is, as has been pointed out by Messrs. Perry and Ayrton,\r\nbecause the time of transmission of momentum is increased; in fact, the\r\nsoft bed is very like a piece of wood interposed between a nail and\r\nthe blows of a hammer—it lengthens the duration of impact. For this\r\nreason we are told that a quaking bog will make a good foundation. When\r\na shock enters loose materials its waves will be more crowded, and it\r\nis possible that a line of buildings may rest on more than one wave\r\nduring a shock. There are many examples on record of the stability of\r\nbuildings which rested on beds of particular material at the time of\r\ndestructive earthquakes. As the observations which have been made\r\nby various writers on this subject appear to point in a contrary\r\ndirection, I give the following examples:—\r\n\r\nIn the great Jamaica earthquake of 1692, the portions of Port\r\nRoyal which remained standing were situated on a compact limestone\r\nfoundation; whilst those on sand and gravel were destroyed (‘Geological\r\nObserver,’ p. 426). Again, on p. 148 of the same work, we read,\r\n‘According to the observations made at Lisbon, in 1737, by Mr. Sharpe,\r\nthe destroying effects of this earthquake were confined to the tertiary\r\nstrata, and were most violent on the blue clay, on which the lower part\r\nof the city is constructed. Not a building on the secondary limestone\r\nor on the basalt was injured.’\r\n\r\nIn the great earthquakes of Messina, those portions of the town\r\nsituated on alluvium, near the sea, were destroyed, whilst the high\r\nparts of the town, on granite, did not suffer so much. Similar\r\nobservations were made in Calabria, when districts consisting of\r\ngravel, sand, and clay became, by the shaking, almost unrecognisable,\r\nwhilst the surrounding hills of slate and granite were but little\r\naltered. At San Francisco, in 1868, the chief destruction was in the\r\nalluvium and made ground.\r\n\r\nAt Talcahuano, in 1835, the only houses which escaped were the\r\nbuildings standing on rocky ground; all those resting on sandy soil\r\nwere destroyed.\r\n\r\nFrom the results of observations like these, it would seem the harder\r\nrocks form better foundations than the softer ones. The explanation of\r\nthis, in many cases, appears to lie in the fact that the soft strata\r\nwere in a state of unstable equilibrium, and by shaking, they were\r\ncaused to settle. Observations like the following, however, point out\r\nanother reason why soft strata may sometimes afford a bad foundation.\r\n\r\n‘Humboldt observed that the Cordilleras, composed of gneiss and\r\nmica-slate, and the country immediately at their foot, were more shaken\r\nthan the plains.’[30]\r\n\r\n‘Some writers have asserted that the wave-like movements (of the\r\nCalabrian earthquake in 1783) which were propagated through recent\r\nstrata from west to east, became very violent when they reached the\r\npoint of junction with the granite, as if a reaction was produced when\r\nthe undulatory movement of the soft strata was suddenly arrested by the\r\nmore solid rocks.’\r\n\r\nDolomieu when speaking of this earthquake says, the usual effect ‘was\r\nto disconnect from the sides of the Apennines all those masses (of sand\r\nand clay) which either had not sufficient bases for their bulk, or\r\nwhich were supported only by lateral adherence.’\r\n\r\nThese intensified actions taking place at and near to lines of\r\njunction between dissimilar strata is probably due to the phenomena of\r\nreflection and refraction.\r\n\r\nWhen referring to the question as to whether buildings situated on\r\nloose materials suffered more or less than those on solid rocks,\r\nMallet, in his description of the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857,\r\nremarks: ‘We have in this earthquake, towns such as Saponara and\r\nViggiano, situated upon solid limestone, totally prostrated; and we\r\nhave others such as Montemarro, to a great extent based upon loose\r\nclays, totally levelled. We have examples of almost complete immunity\r\nin places on plains of deep clay as that of Viscolione, and in places\r\non solid limestone, like Castelluccio, or perched on mountain tops like\r\nPetina.’[31]\r\n\r\nAfter reading the above, we see that the probable reason why, in\r\nseveral cases, beds of soft materials have not made good foundations,\r\nconsists in the fact that they have either been of small extent or else\r\nhave been observed only in the neighbourhood of lines which divided\r\nthem from other formations, which lines are always those of great\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his description of the Neapolitan earthquake of 1857,\r\nMallet says that more buildings were destroyed on the rock than on the\r\nloose clay. This, however, he remarks, is hardly a fact from which we\r\ncan draw any valuable deductions, because it so happened that more\r\nbuildings were constructed on the hills than on the loose ground.[1]\r\n\r\nProfessor D. S. Martin, writing on the earthquake of New England in\r\n1874, remarks that in Long Island the shock was felt where there was\r\ngneiss between the drift. Around portions to the east the observations\r\nwere few and far between. He also remarks that generally the shocks\r\nwere felt more strongly and frequently on rocky than on soft ground.[32]\r\n\r\nFrom these examples, it would appear that the hard ground, which\r\nusually means the hills, forms a better foundation than the softer\r\nground, which is usually to be found in the valleys and plains. Other\r\nexamples, however, point to a different conclusion. For instance, a\r\ncivil engineer, writing about the New Zealand earthquake of 1855, when\r\nall the brick buildings in Wellington were overthrown, says that ‘it\r\nwas most violent on the sides of the hills at those places, and least\r\nso in the centre of the alluvial plains.’[33]\r\n\r\nIn this example it must be noticed that the soft alluvium here referred\r\nto was of large extent, and not loose material resting on the flanks of\r\nrocks, from which it was likely to be shaken down, as in most of the\r\nprevious examples.\r\n\r\nThe results of my own observations on this subject point as much in one\r\ndirection as in the other. In Tokio, from instrumental observations\r\nupon the slopes and tops of hills, the disturbance appears to be\r\nvery much less than it is in the plains. Thus, at my house, situated\r\non the slope of a hill about 100 feet in height, for the earthquake\r\nof March 11, 1882, I obtained a maximum amplitude of motion of from\r\nthree to four millimètres only, whilst Professor Ewing, with a similar\r\ninstrument, situated on the level ground at about a mile distant,\r\nfound a motion of fully seven millimètres. This calculation has been\r\nconfirmed by observations on other earthquakes. Thus, for instance, in\r\nthe destructive earthquake of 1855, when a large portion of Tokio was\r\ndevastated, it was a fact, remarked by many, that the disturbance was\r\nmost severe on the low ground and in the valleys, whilst on the hills\r\nthe shock had been comparatively weak. As another illustration, I may\r\nmention that within three-quarters of a mile from my house in Tokio\r\nthere is a prince’s residence which has so great a reputation for the\r\nseverity of the shakings it receives that its marketable value has been\r\nconsiderably depreciated, and it is now untenanted.\r\n\r\nIn Hakodadi, which is a town situated very similarly to Gibraltar,\r\npartly built on the slope of a high rocky mountain and partly on a\r\nlevel plain, from which the mountain rises, the rule is similar to\r\nthat for Tokio, namely, that the low, flat ground is shaken more\r\nseverely than the high ground. At Yokohama, sixteen miles south-west\r\nfrom Tokio, the rule is reversed, as was very clearly demonstrated\r\nby the earthquake of February 1880, when almost every house upon the\r\nhigh ground lost its chimney, whilst on the low ground there was\r\nscarcely any damage done; the only places on the low ground which\r\nsuffered were those near to the base of the hills. The evidence as to\r\nthe relative value of hard ground as compared with soft ground, for\r\nthe foundation of a building, is very conflicting. Sometimes the hard\r\nground has proved the better foundation and sometimes the softer, and\r\nthe superiority of one over the other depends, no doubt, upon a variety\r\nof local circumstances.\r\n\r\nThese latter observations open up the inquiry as to the extent to which\r\nthe intensity of an earthquake may be modified by the topography of the\r\ndisturbed area.\r\n\r\n_The swing of mountains._—If an earthquake wave is passing through\r\nground the surface of which is level, so long as this ground is\r\nhomogeneous, as the wave travels further and further we should expect\r\nits energy to become less and less, until, finally, it would insensibly\r\ndie out. If, however, we have standing upon this plain a mountain,\r\njudging from Mallet’s remarks, this mountain would be set in a state\r\nof vibration much in the same way as a house is set in vibration,\r\nand it would tend to oscillate backward and forward with a period of\r\nvibration dependent upon the nature of its materials, size, and form.\r\nThe upper portion of this mountain would, in consequence, swing through\r\na greater arc than the lower portion, and buildings situated on the top\r\nof it would swing to and fro through a greater arc than those which\r\nwere situated near its foot. This explanation why buildings situated\r\non the top of a mountain should suffer more than those situated on\r\na plain, is one which was offered by Mallet when writing of the\r\nNeapolitan earthquake. He tells us that towns on hills are ‘rocked as\r\non the top of masts,’ and if we accept this explanation it would, in\r\nfact, be one reason why the houses situated on the Bluff at Yokohama\r\nsuffered more than those situated in the settlement. This explanation\r\nis given on account of the great authority it claims as a consequence\r\nof its source. It is not clear how the statement can be supported,\r\nas different portions of the mountain receive momentum in opposite\r\ndirections at the same time.\r\n\r\n_Want of support on the faces of hills._—When a wave of elastic\r\ncompression is propagated through a medium, we see that the energy of\r\nmotion is being continually transmitted from particle to particle of\r\nthat medium. A particle, in moving forwards, meets with an elastic\r\nresistance of the particles towards which it moves, but, overcoming\r\nthese resistances, it causes these latter particles to move, and in\r\nturn to transmit the energy to others further on. So long as the medium\r\nin which this transfer of energy is continuous, each particle has a\r\nlimit to its extent of motion, dependent on the nature of the medium.\r\nWhen, however, the medium, which we will suppose to be the earth, is\r\nnot continuous, but suddenly terminates with a cliff or scarp, the\r\nparticles adjacent to this cliff or scarp, having no resistance offered\r\nto their forward motion, are shot forward, and, consequently, the\r\nground here is subjected to more extensive vibrations than at those\r\nplaces where it was continuous. This may be illustrated by a row of\r\nmarbles lying in a horizontal groove; a single marble rolled against\r\none end of this row will give a concussion which will run through the\r\nchain, like the bumping of an engine against a row of railway cars, and\r\nas a result, the marble at the opposite end of the row, being without\r\nsupport, will fly off. Tyndall illustrates the same thing with his\r\nwell known row of boys, each one standing with his arms stretched out\r\nand his hands resting upon the shoulders of the boy before him. A push\r\nbeing given to the boy at the back, the effect is to transmit a push\r\nto the first boy, who, being unsupported, flies forward.\r\n\r\nIn the case of some earthquakes, most disastrous results have occurred\r\nwhich seem only to admit of an explanation such as this. A remarkable\r\ninstance of this kind occurred when the great earthquake of 1857 ‘swept\r\nalong the Alps from Geneva to the east-north-east, and its crest\r\nreached the edge of the deep glen between Zermatt and Visp. Then the\r\nupper part of the wave-movement, a thousand or two thousand feet in\r\ndepth from the surface, came to an end; the forward pulsation acted\r\nlike the breaker of the sea, and heavy falls of rock encumbered the\r\nwestern side of the valley.’\r\n\r\n_Earthquake shadows._—If a mountain stands upon a plain through which\r\nan elastic wave is passing, which is almost horizontal, the mountain\r\nis, so to speak, in the _shadow_ of such a wave. If we only consider\r\nthe normal motion of this wave, we see that the only motion which the\r\nmountain can obtain will be a wave of elastic distortion produced\r\nby a shearing force along the plain of the base. Should, however,\r\nthe wave approach the mountain from below, and emerge into it at a\r\ncertain angle, only the portion of the mountain on the side from\r\nwhich the wave advanced could remain in shadow, whilst the portion\r\non the opposite side would be thrown into a state of compression and\r\nextension. Portions in shadow, however, would be subject to waves\r\nof elastic distortion. In a manner similar to this we may imagine\r\nthat certain portions of the bluff, so far as the advancing wave was\r\nconcerned, were in shadow, and thus saved from the immediate influence\r\nof the direct shock. A hypothetical case of such a shadow is shown in\r\nthe accompanying section, illustrating the contour of the ground at\r\nYokohama. The situation which might be in the shadow of one shock,\r\nhowever, it is quite possible might not be in that of another. We\r\nmust also remember that a place in shadow for a direct shock might be\r\naffected by reflected waves, and also by the transverse vibrations of\r\nthe direct shock. These effects are over and above the effects produced\r\nby the waves of elastic distortion just referred to. It might be asked\r\nwhether whole countries, like England, which are but seldom shaken, are\r\nin shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—Hypothetical section at Yokohama.]\r\n\r\n_Destruction due to the interference of waves._—Referring to the\r\nsection of the ground at Yokohama (Fig. 27), it will be seen that\r\nboth the settlement and the bluff stand upon beds of gravel capping\r\nhorizontal beds of grey tuff. The gravel of that portion of the\r\nsettlement on the seaboard originally formed the line of a shingle\r\nbeach. That portion of the settlement back from the sea stands upon\r\nground which was originally marshy. In the central portions of the\r\nsettlement this bed of gravel is very thick, perhaps 100 feet or so,\r\nbut as you near the edge of the bluff it probably becomes thinner,\r\nuntil it finally dies out upon the flanks of the scarps.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the bluff, the beds of gravel will, in every probability,\r\nbe generally thinner than they are upon the lower level. The beds of\r\ntuff, which is a soft grey-coloured clay-like rock, produced by the\r\nsolidification of volcanic mud, appear, when walking on the seaboard,\r\nto be horizontally stratified. If there is a dip inland, it is in all\r\nprobability very slight. Here and there the beds slightly faulted.\r\nTaken as a whole we may consider these beds as being tolerably\r\nhomogeneous, and an earthquake in passing through them would meet\r\nwith but little reflection or refraction. At the junction of these\r\nbeds with the overlying gravels, both reflection and refraction would\r\ncomparatively be very great.\r\n\r\nOn entering the gravel, as the wave would be passing into a less\r\nelastic medium, the direction of the wave would be bent towards the\r\nperpendicular to the line of junction, and the angle of emergence at\r\nthe surface would consequently be augmented. At the surface certain\r\nreflection would also take place, but the chief reflections would be\r\nthose at the junction of the tuff and the alluvium.\r\n\r\nUnder the settlement it is probable that all the reflections which\r\ntook place would be single. Thus wave fronts like A_{1} advancing in\r\na direction parallel to the line _a__{1}; would be reflected in a\r\ndirection _a__{2} and give rise to a series of reflected waves A_{2}.\r\nThese are shown by thicker lines. Similarly all the neighbouring waves\r\nto the right and left of A_{1} would give rise to a series of reflected\r\nwaves. If the lines drawn representing wave fronts are districts of\r\ncompression, then, where two of the lines cross each other, there would\r\nbe double energy in producing compression. Similarly, districts of\r\nrarefaction might accord, and, again, compression of one wave might\r\nmeet with the rarefaction of another and a neutralisation of effect\r\ntake place. A diagram illustrating concurrence and interference of this\r\ndescription is given in Le Conte’s ‘Elements of Geology,’ p. 115. The\r\ninterference which has been spoken of, however, is not the greatest\r\nwhich would occur. The greatest would probably be beneath the bluff and\r\nthe scarps which run down to join the level ground below. This would be\r\nthe case because it is a probability that there might not only be cases\r\nof interference of single reflected waves, but also of waves which\r\nhad been not only twice but perhaps thrice reflected. For example, a\r\nwave like B_{1} (which is parallel to A_{1} of the first supposition),\r\nadvancing in a direction parallel to _b__{1} might be reflected along\r\nthe line _b__{2} giving rise to waves like B_{2}, which in turn might\r\nbe reflected along _b__{3} giving rise to waves like B_{3}. The number\r\nof districts where there would be concurrence and interference would,\r\nin consequence of the number of times waves might be reflected, be\r\naugmented. Here the violence of the shock would, at certain points, be\r\nconsiderably increased, but as a general result energy must be lost,\r\nso that even if some of the reflected waves found their way into the\r\nportion we have regarded as being in shadow, their intensity would not\r\nbe so great as if they had entered it directly.\r\n\r\nThe shaking down of loose materials from the sides of hills may be\r\npartially explained on the assumption of an increased disturbance due\r\nto interference.\r\n\r\n_Earthquake bridges._—In certain parts of South America there appear\r\nto exist tracts of ground which are practically exempt from earthquake\r\nshocks, whilst the whole country around is sometimes violently shaken.\r\nIt would seem as if the shock passes beneath such a district as water\r\npasses beneath a bridge, and for this reason these districts have been\r\nchristened ‘bridges.’\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon appears to depend upon the nature of the underlying\r\nsoil. When an elastic wave passes from one bed of rock to another of a\r\ndifferent character, a certain portion of the wave is reflected, while\r\nthe remainder of it is transmitted and refracted, and ‘bridges’ we\r\nmay conceive of as occurring where the phenomenon of total reflection\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nIn the instances given of soft materials having proved good\r\nfoundations, it was assumed that they had chiefly acted as absorbers\r\nof momentum. They have also acted as reflecting surfaces, and where no\r\neffects have been felt by those residing on them, this may have been\r\nthe result of total reflection, and the soft beds thus have played the\r\npart of bridges.\r\n\r\nFuchs gives an example taken from the records of the Syrian earthquake\r\nof 1837, where not only neighbouring villages suffered differently, but\r\neven neighbouring houses. In one case a house was entirely destroyed,\r\nwhilst in the next house nothing was felt.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, at a place called Choshi, about 55 miles east of the capital,\r\nearthquakes are but seldom felt, although the surrounding districts may\r\nbe severely shaken.\r\n\r\nFrom descriptions of this place it would appear that there is a large\r\nbasaltic boss rising in the midst of alluvial strata. The immunity from\r\nearthquakes in this district has probably given rise to the myth of\r\nthe Kanam rock, which is a stone supposed to rest upon the head of a\r\nmonstrous catfish (Namadzu), which by its writhings causes the shakings\r\nso often felt in this part of the world.[34]\r\n\r\nProf. D. S. Martin, writing on the earthquake of New England in 1874,\r\nsays that it was felt at four points; it was felt in the heart of\r\nBrooklyn all within a circle of half a mile across; ‘and this fact\r\nwould suggest that a ridge of rock perhaps approaches the surface at\r\nthat point, though none is known to appear.’[35]\r\n\r\nThe subject of special districts, which are more or less protected from\r\nsevere shakings, will be again referred to, and it will be seen that\r\nafter a seismic survey has been made even of a country like Japan,\r\nwhere there are on the average at least two earthquakes per day, it\r\nis possible to choose a place to build in as free from earthquakes as\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n_General examples of earthquake effects._—The following examples of\r\nearthquake effects are drawn from Mallet’s account of the Neapolitan\r\nearthquake of 1857.\r\n\r\nAt a town called Polla there was great destruction. Judging from\r\nthe fissures in the parts that remained standing it seemed that the\r\nemergence of the shock had been more vertical in the upper part of the\r\ntown than in the lower, proving that whatever had been the angle below,\r\nthe hill had itself vibrated, which, being horizontal, had modified the\r\nangle of the fissures.\r\n\r\nDiano suffered but little, partly because it was well built, and partly\r\non account of its situation, which was such that before the shock\r\nreached it the disturbance had to pass from beds of clay into nearly\r\nvertically placed beds of limestone. Also a great portion of the shock\r\nwas cut off by the Vallone del Raccio to the north and north-west of\r\nthe town. Here the effects of the partial extinction of the wave on the\r\n‘free outlaying stratum’ were visible in the masses of projected rock.\r\n\r\nCastellucio did not suffer because its well buttressed knoll was end\r\non to the direction of shock, and on account of a barrier of vertical\r\nbreccia beds protecting it upon the east.\r\n\r\nPertosa stands on a mound. The destruction was least in the southern\r\npart of the town. From the relation of the beds of breccia on which the\r\ntown stands, and the direction of the wave path, it is evident that the\r\nsouthern part of the town received the force of the shock through a\r\ngreater thickness of the breccia beds than the other parts did.\r\n\r\nPetina, standing on a level limestone spur jutting out from a mountain\r\nslope, suffered nothing, whilst Anletta five miles to the south-west,\r\nand Pertosa six miles distant, were in great part prostrated. (1) The\r\nterrace did not vibrate, and (2) between Petina and Anletta there is\r\nalmost 6,000 feet of piled up limestone, so that any shock emergent at\r\na steep angle had to pass up transversely through these beds.\r\n\r\n_Protection of buildings._—In addition to giving proper construction\r\nto our buildings, choosing proper foundations and positions for them,\r\nsomething might possibly be done to ward off the destructive effects of\r\nan earthquake. We read that the Temple of Diana at Ephesus was built on\r\nthe edge of a marsh, in order to ward off the effect of earthquakes.\r\nPliny tells us that the Capitol of Rome was saved by the Catacombs,\r\nand Elisée Reclus[36] says that the Romans and Hellenes found out that\r\ncaverns, wells, and quarries retarded the disturbance of the earth,\r\nand protected edifices in their neighbourhood. The tower of Capua was\r\nsaved by its numerous wells. Vivenzis asserts that in building the\r\nCapitol the Romans sunk wells to weaken the effects of terrestrial\r\noscillations. Humboldt relates the same of the inhabitants of San\r\nDomingo.\r\n\r\nQuito is said to receive protection from the numerous cañons in the\r\nneighbourhood, whilst Lactacunga, fifteen miles distant, has often been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it is extremely probable that many portions of Tokio have\r\nfrom time to time been protected more or less from the severe shocks of\r\nearthquakes by the numerous moats and deep canals which intersect it.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not prepared to say how far artificial openings of this\r\ndescription are effectual in warding off the shocks of earthquakes,\r\nfrom theoretical considerations, and from the fact that their use has\r\nbeen discovered by persons who, in all probability, were without the\r\nmeans of making theoretical deductions, the suggestions which they\r\noffer are worthy of attention.\r\n\r\n_General conclusions._—The following are a few of the more important\r\nresults which may be drawn from the preceding chapter:—\r\n\r\n1. In choosing a site for a house find out by the experience of others\r\nor experimental investigation the localities which are least disturbed.\r\nIn some cases this will be upon the hills, in others in the valleys and\r\non the plains.\r\n\r\n2. A wide open plain is less likely to be disturbed than a position on\r\na hill.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid loose materials resting on harder strata.\r\n\r\n4. If the shakings are definite in direction, place the blank walls\r\nparallel to such directions, and the walls with many openings in them\r\nat right angles to such directions.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid the edges of scarps or bluffs, both above and below.\r\n\r\n6. So arrange the openings in a wall, that for horizontal stresses the\r\nwall shall be of equal strength for all sections at right angles.\r\n\r\n7. Place lintels over flat arches of brick or stone.\r\n\r\n8. To withstand destructive shocks either rigidly follow one or other\r\nof the two systems of constructing an earthquake-proof building. The\r\nlight building on loose foundations is the cheaper and probably the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n9. Let all portions of a building have their natural periods of\r\nvibration nearly equal.\r\n\r\n10. If it is a necessity that one portion of a building should have a\r\nvery different period of vibration to the remainder, as for instance a\r\nbrick chimney in a wooden house, it would seem advisable either to let\r\nthese two portions be sufficiently free to have an independent motion,\r\nor else they must be bound together with great strength.\r\n\r\n11. Avoid heavy topped roofs and chimneys. If the foundations were free\r\nthe roof might be heavy.\r\n\r\n12. In brick or stone work use good cement.\r\n\r\n13. Let archways curve into their abutments.\r\n\r\n14. Let roofs have a low pitch, and the tiles, especially those upon\r\nthe ridges, be well secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                    EFFECTS OF EARTHQUAKES ON LAND,\r\n\r\n  1. Cracks and fissures—Materials discharged from\r\n    fissures—Explanation of fissure phenomena. 2. Disturbances in\r\n    lakes, rivers, springs, wells, fumaroles, &c.—Explanation of\r\n    these latter phenomena. 3. Permanent displacement of ground—On\r\n    coast lines—Level tracts—Among mountains—Explanation of these\r\n    movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cracks and fissures formed in the ground._—Almost all large\r\nearthquakes have produced cracks in the ground. The cracks which were\r\nfound in the ground at Yokohama (February 22, 1880) were about two or\r\nthree inches wide, and from twenty to forty yards in length. They could\r\nbe best seen as lines along a road running near the upper edge of some\r\ncliffs which overlook the sea at that place. The reason that cracks\r\nshould have occurred in such a position rather than in others was\r\nprobably owing to the greater motion at such a place, due to the face\r\nof the cliff being unsupported, and there being no resistance opposed\r\nto its forward motion. It often happens that earthquake cracks are many\r\nfeet in width. At the Calabrian earthquake of 1783, one or two of the\r\ncrevasses which were formed were more than 100 feet in width and 200\r\nfeet in depth. Their lengths varied from half a mile to a mile.[37]\r\nBesides these large cracks, many smaller ones of one or two feet in\r\nbreadth and of great length were formed. In the large fissures many\r\nhouses were engulfed. Subsequent excavations showed that by the closing\r\nof the fissures these had been jammed together to form one compact\r\nmass. These cracks are usually more or less parallel, and at the same\r\ntime parallel to some topographical feature, like a range of mountains.\r\nFor example, the cracks which were formed by the Mississippi earthquake\r\nof 1812 ran from north-east to south-west parallel to the Alleghanies.\r\nBy succeeding shocks these crevasses are sometimes closed and sometimes\r\nopened still wider. Their permanency will also depend upon the nature\r\nof the materials in which they are made.\r\n\r\nDuring an earthquake large cracks may suddenly open and shut.\r\n\r\nDuring the convulsions of 1692 which destroyed Port Royal, it is said\r\nthat many of the fissures which were formed, opened and shut. In some\r\nof these, people were entirely swallowed up and buried. In others they\r\nwere trapped by the middle, and even by the neck, where if not killed\r\ninstantaneously they perished slowly. Subsequently their projecting\r\nparts formed food for dogs.[38]\r\n\r\nThe earthquake which, July 18, 1880, shook the Philippines caused many\r\nfissures to be found, which in some places were so numerous that the\r\nground was broken up into steps. Near to the village of San Antonio the\r\nsoil was so disturbed that the surface of a field of sugar-canes was\r\nso altered that in some cases the top of one row of full grown plants\r\nwas on a level with the roots of the next. Into one such fissure a boat\r\ndisappeared, and into another, a child.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the child was excavated, and its body, which was found a\r\nshort distance below the surface, was completely crushed.[39]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Riobamba earthquake, not only were men engulfed,\r\nbut animals, like mules, also sank into the fissures which were formed.\r\n\r\nThe fissures which were formed at the time of the Owen’s Valley\r\nearthquake in 1872 extended for miles nearly parallel to the\r\nneighbouring Sierras. In some places the ground between the fissures\r\nsank twenty or thirty feet, and at one place about three miles east of\r\nIndependence, a portion of the road was carried eighteen feet to the\r\nsouth by a fissure.[40]\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, it may be said that all large earthquakes are\r\naccompanied by the formation of fissures. The Japanese have a saying\r\nthat at the time of a large earthquake persons must run to a bamboo\r\ngrove.\r\n\r\nThe object of this is to escape the danger of being engulfed in\r\nfissures, the ground beneath a bamboo grove being so netted together\r\nwith fine roots that it is almost impossible for it to be rent open.\r\n\r\n_Materials discharged from fissures._—Together with the opening of\r\ncracks in the earth it often has happened that water, mud, vapours,\r\ngases, and other materials, have been ejected.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Mississippi earthquake water, mixed with sand and\r\nmud, was thrown out with such violence that it spurted above the tops\r\nof the highest trees. In Italy such phenomena have often been repeated.\r\n\r\nFrom the fissures which were formed in 1692 at the time of the\r\nearthquakes in Sicily, water issued which in some instances was\r\nsalt.[41]\r\n\r\nBy the Cachar earthquake (January 10, 1869) numerous fissures were\r\nformed parallel to the banks of a river, from this water and mud were\r\nejected. Dr. Oldham, who describes this earthquake, says that the\r\nfirst shot of dry mud or sand was mistaken for smoke or steam. The\r\nwater was foul, and hotter than surface water at the time, but only\r\nslightly so; and the sulphurous smell was nothing more than you would\r\nperceive in stirring up the mud at the bottom of any stagnant pool\r\nwhich had lain undisturbed for some time.[42]\r\n\r\nIn 1755, when Tauris was destroyed, boiling water issued from the\r\ncracks which were formed. Similar phenomena were witnessed at a place\r\neight miles from La Banca in Mexico, in the year 1820. Part of this hot\r\nwater was pure and part was muddy.\r\n\r\nSometimes the water which has been ejected has been so muddy that the\r\nmud has been collected to form small hills. This was the case at the\r\ntime of the Riobamba earthquake. The mud in this case consisted partly\r\nof coal, fragments of augite, and shells of infusoria.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Jamaica earthquake men who had fallen into crevices\r\nwere in some cases thrown out again by issuing water.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as has already been mentioned, vapour, gases, and even\r\nflames issue from fissures. Vapour of sulphur appears to be exceedingly\r\ncommon. Kluge says that many fish were killed in consequence of the\r\nsulphurous vapours which rose in the sea near to the coast of New\r\nZealand in 1855.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 1797, an insupportable smell of sulphur was observed to\r\nhave accompanied the earthquake which at that time shook Cumana, which\r\nwas greatest when the disturbance was greatest.\r\n\r\nSulphurous fumes which were combustible were belched out of the\r\nearth at the time of the Jamaica earthquake in 1692. The smell which\r\naccompanied this was so powerful that it caused a general sickness\r\nwhich swept away about 3,000 persons.[43]\r\n\r\nFrom the fissures formed at Concepcion in 1835, water, which was black\r\nand fœtid, issued.[44]\r\n\r\nThe earthquakes of New England in 1727 were accompanied by the\r\nformation of fissures, from which sand and water boiled out in\r\nsufficient quantity to form a quagmire. In some places ash and sulphur\r\nare said to have been ejected.\r\n\r\nAt one house the stink of sulphur accompanying the earthquake was so\r\ngreat that the family could not bear to remain in doors.[45]\r\n\r\nEmanations of gas sometimes appear to have burst out from submarine\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThus the earthquake at Lima, in March, 1865, was accompanied with great\r\nagitation of the water and an odour of sulphuretted and carburetted\r\nhydrogen. This former gas was developed to such an extent that the\r\nwhite paint of the U.S. ship ‘Lancaster’ was blackened.[46] With the\r\nsmell, flames have sometimes been observed, as, for instance, at the\r\ntime of the Lisbon earthquake.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the earthquakes of 1811 and 1813, in the Mississippi\r\nvalley, steam and smoke issued from some of the fissures which were\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nInstances are recorded where stones have been shot up from fissures\r\nunaccompanied by water, as, for instance, at the earthquake of Pasto\r\n(January, 1834). It is imagined that the propelling power must have\r\nbeen the sudden expansion of escaping gases.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that flames seen above fissures might perhaps\r\nbe due to the burning of materials like sulphur. Mr. D. Forbes, who\r\nexamined the effects of the earthquakes of Mendoza, which were felt for\r\na distance of 1,200 miles, says that where the hard rock came to the\r\nsurface there were no traces of fissures, these being entirely confined\r\nto the alluvium. The rumours of fire and smoke having appeared at some\r\nof the fissures were without foundation, the presumed smoke being\r\nnothing but dust.[47]\r\n\r\nIn addition to flames lights appear often to have been observed, the\r\norigin of which cannot be easily explained.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of November 22, 1751, at Genoa is said to have been\r\naccompanied by a light like that of a prodigious fire which seemed to\r\narise out of the ground.[48]\r\n\r\n_Explanation of fissure phenomena._—The manner in which fissures are\r\nformed has already been explained when referring to the want of support\r\nin the face of hills (page 136).\r\n\r\nSimilar remarks may be applied to the banks of rivers and all\r\ndepressions, whether natural or artificial, which have a steep slope.\r\nAt such places the wave of shock emerges on a free surface, which,\r\nbeing unsupported in the direction of its motion, tends to tear itself\r\naway from the material behind, and form a fissure parallel to the face\r\nof the free surface. The distance of the fissure from the face of the\r\nfree surface will, theoretically, be equal to half the amplitude of the\r\nwave of motion, one half tending to move forwards, and the other half\r\nbackwards. The reason that water and other materials rush forth from\r\nfissures has been explained by Schüler as being due to cracks having\r\nbeen opened through impervious strata, which, before the earthquake,\r\nby their continuity prevented the rising of subterranean water under\r\nhydrostatic pressure.[49]\r\n\r\nKluge explains the coming up of the waters as being due to the same\r\ncauses which he considers may be the origin of disturbances in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe most reasonable explanations of the eruption of water, mud, sand,\r\nand gas through fissures are those given by Oldham and Mallet in their\r\naccount of the Cachar earthquake.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a horizontal shock passing through a bed of ooze or\r\nwater-bearing strata, the elastic wave will tend to pack up the water\r\nduring the forward motion to such an extent that it will flow or\r\nspout up through any aperture communicating with the surface. By the\r\nrepetition of these movements causing ejections, sand or mud cones,\r\nlike those produced by a volcanic eruption, may be formed, and by a\r\nsimilar action water may be shot violently up out of wells, as was the\r\ncase in Jamaica in 1692.\r\n\r\nIf an emergent wave acts through a water-bearing bed upon a\r\nsuperincumbent layer of impervious material, this upper layer is,\r\nduring the upward motion, by its inertia suddenly pressed down upon the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThis pressure is equal to that which would raise the upper layer to\r\na height equal to the amplitude of the motion of an earth particle,\r\nand with a velocity at least equal to the mean velocity of the earth\r\nparticle resolved in the vertical direction.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the water-bearing strata receive an enormous squeeze, and\r\nthe water or mud starts up through any crevice which may be formed\r\nleading to the surface.\r\n\r\nFrom this we see that liquids may rise far beyond the level due to\r\nhydrostatic pressure.[50]\r\n\r\nVolger has attributed the origin of lights or flames appearing above\r\nfissures to the friction which must take place between various rocky\r\nmaterials at the time when the fissures are opened. As confirmatory of\r\nthis he refers to instances where similar phenomena have been observed\r\nat the time of landslips. At the time of these landslips the heat\r\ndeveloped by friction has been sufficiently intense to convert water\r\ninto steam, the tension of which threw mud and earth into the air like\r\nthe explosion of a mine.[51]\r\n\r\nThe gas eruptions which occasionally take place with earthquakes are\r\nprobably due to the opening of fissures communicating with reservoirs\r\nor strata charged with products of natural distillation, or chemical\r\naction, which previously had accumulated beneath impervious strata. Of\r\nthe existence of such gases we have abundant evidence. In coal mines we\r\nhave fire damp which escapes in increased quantities with a lowering of\r\nthe barometrical pressure. In volcanic regions we have many examples of\r\nnatural springs of carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nThese various gases sometimes escape in quantity, or erupt without\r\nthe occurrence of earthquakes. Rossi mentions an instance where a few\r\nyears ago quantities of fish were killed by the eruption of gas in the\r\nTiber, near Rome. Another instance is one which occurred at Follonica\r\non April 6, 1874. On the morning of that day many of the streets and\r\nroads were covered with the dead bodies of rats and mice. It seemed as\r\nif it had rained rats. From the facts that the bodies of the creatures\r\nseemed healthy, that the destruction had happened suddenly, and not\r\ncome on gradually like an epidemic, it was supposed that they had been\r\ndestroyed by an emanation of carbon dioxide. The fact that many of them\r\nlay in long lines suggested the idea that they had been endeavouring\r\nto escape at the time of the eruption.[52] If we can suppose sudden\r\ndevelopments of gas like this to have occasionally accompanied\r\nearthquakes, we may sometimes have the means of accounting for the\r\nsickness which has been felt.\r\n\r\n_Disturbances in lakes._—It has often been observed that, at the time\r\nof large earthquakes, lakes have been thrown into violent agitation,\r\nand their waters have been raised or lowered. At the time of the great\r\nLisbon earthquake, not only were the waters of European lakes thrown\r\ninto a state of oscillation, but similar effects were produced in the\r\ngreat lakes of North America. In some instances, as in the case of\r\nsmall ponds, these movements may be produced by the horizontal backward\r\nand forward motion of the ground. At other times they are probably due\r\nto an actual tipping of a portion of their basins. Movements like these\r\nlatter will be again referred to in the chapter on Earth Pulsations.\r\nOn January 27, 1856, there was a shock of earthquake at Bailyborough,\r\nIreland, which occasioned an adjacent lough to overflow its banks\r\nand rush into the town with great impetuosity. In returning it swept\r\naway two men, leaving behind a great quantity of pike and eels of a\r\nprodigious growth.[53]\r\n\r\n_Disturbances in rivers._—Just as lakes have been disturbed, so also\r\nhave there been sudden disturbances in rivers. Sometimes these have\r\noverflowed their banks, whilst at other times they have been suddenly\r\ndried up. In certain cases the reason that a portion of a river should\r\nhave become dry has been very apparent, as, for instance, at the time\r\nof the Zenkoji earthquake in Japan in 1847, when the Shikuma-gawa\r\nbecame partly dry in consequence of the large masses of earth which\r\nhad been shaken down from overhanging cliffs damming a portion of\r\nits course, and thus forming, first, lakes, and subsequently, new\r\nwater-courses. As another example, out of the many which might be\r\nquoted, may be mentioned the sudden drying up of the river Aboat,\r\na tributary of the Magat, in the Philippine Islands, on July 27,\r\n1881, shortly after a severe shock of earthquake. The water of this\r\nriver ceased to flow for two hours, after which it reappeared with\r\nconsiderable increase of volume and of a reddish colour. Signor E. A.\r\nCasariego, who describes this, remarks that the phenomenon could easily\r\nbe explained through the slipping down of the steep banks in narrow\r\nparts of its upper valley, by which means its flow had been obstructed\r\nuntil the water had time to accumulate and pass over or demolish the\r\nobstruction.\r\n\r\nAfter the earthquake of Belluno (June 29, 1873), the torrent Tesa,\r\nwhich is ordinarily limpid, became very muddy.[54] Similar phenomena\r\nhave been observed even in Britain, as, for instance, in 1787, when, at\r\nthe time of a shock which was felt in Glasgow, there was a temporary\r\nstoppage in the waters of the Clyde. Again, in 1110, there was a\r\ndreadful earthquake at Shrewsbury and Nottingham, and the Trent became\r\nso low at Nottingham that people walked over it.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of 1158, which was felt in many parts of England, was\r\naccompanied by the drying up of the Thames, which was so low that it\r\ncould be crossed on foot even at London.[55]\r\n\r\nFacts analogous to these are mentioned in the accounts of many large\r\nearthquakes. Sometimes rivers only come muddy or change their colour.\r\nIn an account of the Lisbon earthquake we read that some of the rivers\r\nnear Neufchâtel suddenly became muddy.[56]\r\n\r\nAt other times large waves are formed. Thus the earthquake of Kansas\r\n(April 24, 1867) apparently created a disturbance in the rivers at\r\nManhattan, which rolled in a heavy wave from the north to the south\r\nbank.[57]\r\n\r\nSometimes curious phenomena have happened with regard to rivers without\r\nthe occurrence of earthquakes. Thus, for instance, on November 27,\r\n1838, there was a simultaneous stoppage of the Teviot, Clyde, and Nith.\r\n\r\nIn these rivers similar phenomena have been observed in previous years.\r\n\r\nAgain, on January 1, 1755, there was a sudden sinking of the river\r\nFrooyd, near Pontypool. This appears to have been due to the water\r\nsinking into chasms which were suddenly opened.[58]\r\n\r\n_Effects produced in springs, wells, fumaroles, &c._—Springs also are\r\noften affected by earthquakes. Sometimes the character of their waters\r\nchange; those which were pure become muddy, whilst those which were hot\r\nhave their temperature altered.\r\n\r\nSometimes springs have been dried up, whilst at other times new springs\r\nhave been formed.\r\n\r\nThis latter was the case in New England (October 27, 1727). In some\r\nplaces springs were formed, whilst at other places they were either\r\nentirely or partly dried up.[59]\r\n\r\nAt and near Lisbon, in 1755, some fountains became muddy, others\r\ndecreased, others increased, and others dried up. At Montreux, Aigle,\r\nand other places, springs became turbid.\r\n\r\nThe baths at Toplitz, in Bohemia, which were discovered in\r\nA.D. 762, were seriously affected by the same earthquake.\r\nPrevious to the earthquake it is said that they had always given a\r\nconstant supply of hot water. At this time, however, the chief spring\r\nsent up vast quantities of water and ran over. One hour before this\r\nit had grown turbid and flowed muddy. After this it stopped for about\r\none minute, but recommenced to flow with prodigious violence, driving\r\nbefore it considerable quantities of reddish ochre. Finally, it settled\r\nback to its original clear state and flowed as before.[60]\r\n\r\nIn 1855, at the earthquake of Wallis, many new springs burst forth, and\r\nsome of these in Nicolai Thale were so rich in iron that they quickly\r\nformed a deposit of ochre.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Belluno earthquake (June 29, 1873), a hot spring, La\r\nVena d’Oro, suddenly became red.[61]\r\n\r\nThe following examples of like changes are taken from the writings of\r\nFuchs.[62]\r\n\r\nIn 1738 the hot springs of St. Euphema rose considerably in their\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nDuring the earthquake of October, 1848, the hot springs of Ardebil,\r\nwhich usually had a temperature of from 44° to 46° C., rose so high\r\nthat their temperature was sufficient to cause scalding.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the earthquake of Wallis, in 1855, the temperature of\r\nhot springs rose 7°, and the quantity of water increased three times.\r\n\r\nDuring the earthquake of 1835 in Chili, the springs of Cauquenes fell\r\nfrom 118° to 92° F. Subsequently, however, they again rose.\r\n\r\nFumaroles are similarly disturbed. Thus, at the time of the earthquakes\r\nof Martinique (September, 1875), the fumaroles there showed an abnormal\r\nactivity.[63]\r\n\r\nWells often appear to be acted upon in the same manner as springs.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the California earthquake (April, 1855), the level of\r\nthe water in certain wells was raised ten to twelve feet.\r\n\r\nA consequence of the earthquake at Neufchâtel, in 1749, was to fill\r\nsome of the wells with mud.[64] At Constantinople, on September 2,\r\n1754, wells became dry.[65]\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the above phenomena._—That the water in springs and\r\nwells should be caused to rise at the time of an earthquake, admits of\r\nexplanation on the supposition of compressions taking place similar\r\nto those which cause the rise of water in fissures. That the water in\r\nwells and springs should be rendered turbid, is partly explained on the\r\nsupposition of more or less dislocation taking place in the earthy or\r\nrocky cavities in which they are contained or through which they flow.\r\n\r\nAt the time of a large earthquake it is extremely probable that there\r\nis a general disturbance in the lines of circulation of subterranean\r\nwaters and gases throughout the shaken area. By these disturbances, new\r\nwaters may be brought to the surface, two or more lines of circulation\r\nmay be united, and the flow of a spring or supply of a well be\r\naugmented. Fissures, through which waters reached the surface, may be\r\nclosed, wells may become dry, or springs may cease to flow, hot springs\r\nmay have their temperature lowered by the additions of cold water\r\nfrom another source, and, in a similar manner, waters may be altered\r\nin their mineralisation. An important point to be remembered in this\r\nconsideration is the mutual dependence of various underground water\r\nsupplies, and the area over which any given supply may circulate. A\r\nwell in the higher part of Lincoln Heath is said to be governed by the\r\nriver Trent, which is ten miles distant; when the river rises the well\r\nrises in proportion, and when the river falls the water in the well\r\nfalls.[66]\r\n\r\nThe change which is usually observed in hot springs is, that before or\r\nwith earthquakes they increase in temperature, but afterwards sink back\r\nto their normal state. This increase in temperature may possibly be due\r\nto communication being opened with new or deeper centres of volcanic\r\nactivity, or a temporarily increased rate of flow.\r\n\r\nThat the water issuing from newly formed fissures or springs should\r\nbe hot, might be explained on the supposition of its arising from a\r\nconsiderable depth, or from some volcanic centre. It might also be\r\nattributed to the heat developed by friction at the opening of the\r\nfissures. These changes which earthquakes produce upon the underground\r\ncirculation of waters are phenomena deserving especial attention.\r\nAlthough we know much about the circulation of surface water, it is but\r\nlittle that we yet know about the movement of the streams hidden from\r\nview, from which these surface waters have their sources. Earthquakes\r\nmay be regarded as gigantic experiments on the circulatory system of\r\nthe earth, which, if properly interpreted, may yield information of\r\nscientific and utilitarian value.\r\n\r\nThe sudden elevations, depressions, or lateral shifting of large tracts\r\nof country at the time of destructive earthquakes are phenomena\r\nwith which all students of geology are familiar. In most cases these\r\ndisplacements have been permanent; and evidences of many of the\r\nmovements which occurred within the memory of man, remain as witnesses\r\nof the terrible convulsions with which they were accompanied.\r\n\r\n_Movements on coast lines and level tracts._—At the time of the\r\ngreat earthquake of Concepcion, on February 20, 1835, much of the\r\nneighbouring coast line was suddenly elevated four or five feet\r\nabove sea level. This, however, subsequently sank until it was only\r\ntwo feet. A rocky flat, off the island of Santa Maria, was lifted\r\nabove high-water mark, and left covered with ‘gaping and putrefying\r\nmussel-shells, still attached to the bed on which they had lived.’ The\r\nnorthern end of the island itself was raised ten feet and the southern\r\nextremity eight feet.[67]\r\n\r\nBy the earthquake of 1839, the island of Lemus, in the Chonos\r\nArchipelago, was suddenly elevated eight feet.[68]\r\n\r\nOf movements like these, especially along the western shores of South\r\nAmerica, Darwin, who paid so much attention to this subject, has given\r\nmany examples. In 1822, the shore near Valparaiso was suddenly lifted\r\nup, and Darwin tells us that he heard it confidently asserted ‘that a\r\nsentinel on duty, immediately after the shock, saw a part of a fort\r\nwhich previously was not within the line of his vision, and this would\r\nindicate that the uplifting was not vertical.’[69] That the large areas\r\nof land should be shifted permanently in horizontal directions, as well\r\nas vertically, we should anticipate from the observations which we are\r\nable to make upon large fissures which are caused by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable example of sudden movement in the rocky crust is\r\nthat which took place during the earthquakes of 1811–12 in the valley\r\nof the Mississippi, near to the mouth of the Ohio, which was convulsed\r\nto such a degree, that lakes, twenty miles in extent, were formed\r\nin the course of an hour. This country, which is called the ‘sunk\r\ncountry,’ extends some seventy to eighty miles north and south, and\r\nthirty miles east and west.[70]\r\n\r\nIn the ‘Gentleman’s Magazine’ we read of the little territory of\r\nCausa Nova, in Calabria, being sunk twenty-nine feet into the earth\r\nby an earthquake, without throwing down a house. The inhabitants,\r\nbeing warned by a noise, escaped into the fields, and only five were\r\nkilled.[71]\r\n\r\nOther examples of these permanent dislocations of strata are to be\r\nfound in almost every text-book on geology.\r\n\r\n_Geological changes produced._—Passing over the accounts of earth\r\nmovements which are more or less fictitious, and confining our\r\nattention to the well authenticated facts, we see at once the important\r\npart which earthquakes have played as agents working geological\r\nchanges. Even in the nineteenth century long tracts of coast, as in\r\nChili and New Zealand, have been raised, whilst other areas, like the\r\nDelta of the Indus, have been sunk. Sir H. Bartle Frere, speaking about\r\nthe disturbance which took place in his latter region in 1819, remarks\r\nthat all the canals drawn from the Fullalee River ceased to run for\r\nabout three days, probably indicating a general upheaval of the lower\r\npart of the canal. In consequence of the earthquakes in former times\r\nit is not unlikely that water-courses have ceased to flow, water has\r\ndecreased in wells, and districts have been depopulated.[72]\r\n\r\nSometimes these changes have taken place gradually and sometimes with\r\nviolence. Mountains have been toppled over, valleys have been filled,\r\ncities have been submerged or buried.\r\n\r\nWith the records of these convulsions before us, we see that seismic\r\nenergy yet exhibits a terrible activity in changing the features of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n_Reason of these movements._—To formulate a single reason for these\r\ncatastrophes would be difficult. Where they are of the nature of\r\nlandslips, or materials have been dislodged from mountain sides, the\r\ncause is evidently the sudden movement of this ground acting upon\r\nstrata not held together in a sufficiently stable condition. A similar\r\nexplanation may be given for the sudden elevations or depressions of\r\nstrata in a district removed from the centre where the disturbance had\r\nits origin. The seismic effort exhibits itself in a certain area round\r\nits origin as a sudden push, and by this push, strata are fractured and\r\ncaused to move relatively to each other.\r\n\r\nAt or near to the origin of an earthquake it might be argued that it\r\nwas the sudden falling of rocky strata towards a position of stable\r\nequilibrium that caused the shaking, and in such a case the movements\r\nreferred to may be regarded as the cause rather than the effect of an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nA subject closely connected with the sudden dislocation of strata,\r\nis the production of secondary or consequent earthquakes, due to the\r\ndisturbance of ground in a critical state (see p. 248).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                      DISTURBANCES IN THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\n  Sea vibrations—Cause of vibratory blows—Sea waves: Preceding\r\n    earthquakes; Succeeding earthquakes—Magnitude of waves—Waves\r\n    as recorded in countries distant from the origin—Records on\r\n    tide gauges—Waves without earthquakes—Cause of waves—Phenomena\r\n    difficult of explanation—Velocity of propagation—Depth of the\r\n    ocean—Examples of calculations—Comparison of velocities of\r\n    earthquake waves with velocities which ought to exist from the\r\n    known depth of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sea vibrations._—Whilst residing in Japan I have had many\r\nopportunities of conversing with persons who had experienced\r\nearthquakes when on board ships, and it has often happened that these\r\nsame earthquakes have been recorded on the shore. For example, at the\r\ntime of every moderately severe earthquake which has shaken Yokohama,\r\nthe same disturbance has been felt on board the ships lying in the\r\nadjoining harbour. In some cases the effect had been as if the ship\r\nwas grounding; in others, as if a number of sharp jerks were being\r\ngiven to the cable. The effect produced upon a man-of-war lying in the\r\nYokohama harbour on the evening of March 11, 1881, was described to me\r\nas a ‘violent irresistible shaking.’ Vessels eighty miles at sea have\r\nrecorded and timed shocks which were felt like sudden blows. These were\r\naccompanied by a noise described as a ‘dull rattle like thunder.’\r\n\r\nIn none of the cases here quoted was any disturbance of the water\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake of Lisbon was felt by vessels on the Atlantic,\r\nfifty miles away from shore.\r\n\r\nOn February 10, 1716, the vessels in the harbour of New Pisco were so\r\nviolently shaken that both ropes and masts were broken, and yet no\r\nmotion in the water was observed. Some have described these shocks like\r\nthose which would be produced by the sudden dropping of large masses of\r\nballast in the hold of the vessel. Other cases are known where rigging\r\nwas damaged, and even cannon have been jerked up and down from the\r\ndecks on which they rested.\r\n\r\n_Cause of vibratory blows._—From the rattling sound which has\r\naccompanied some of these submarine shocks, many of which, it may be\r\nremarked, have never been recorded as earthquakes upon neighbouring\r\nshores, it does not seem improbable that they may have been the result\r\nof the sudden condensation of volumes of steam produced by submarine\r\nvolcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nAs confirmatory of this supposition we have the fact, that many of\r\nthe marine disturbances which might be called ‘sea-quakes,’ have been\r\nobserved in places which are close to, or in the line of, volcanic\r\nvents. Thus, M. Daussy, who has paid special attention to this subject,\r\nhas collected evidence to show that a large number of shocks have been\r\nfelt by vessels in that portion of the Atlantic between Cape Palamas,\r\non the west coast of Africa, and Cape St. Roque, on the east coast of\r\nSouth America.[73]\r\n\r\nSome of the vessels only felt shocks and tremblings, but others saw\r\nsmoke, and some even collected floating ashes. In considering the\r\nsubmarine shocks of this particular area, we must bear in mind that it\r\nlies in the line of Iceland, the west coast of Scotland, the Azores,\r\nCanaries, Cape de Verd Islands, St. Helena, and other places, all of\r\nwhich, if not at present in volcanic activity, shew evidence of having\r\nbeen so within recent times. The connection between volcanic action and\r\nearthquakes will be again referred to.\r\n\r\n_Sea waves._—Although in the above-mentioned instances sea waves have\r\nnot been noticed, it is by no means uncommon to find that destructive\r\nearthquakes have been accompanied by waves of an enormous size, which,\r\nif the earthquake has originated beneath the sea, have, subsequently\r\nto the shaking, rolled in upon the land, to create more devastation\r\nthan the actual earthquake. It may, however, be mentioned that a few\r\nexceptional cases exist when it is said that the sea wave has preceded\r\nthe earthquake, as, for example, at Smyrna, on September 8, 1852.\r\n\r\nAgain, at the earthquake in St. Thomas, in 1868, it is said that the\r\nwater receded shortly _before_ the first shock. When it returned, after\r\nthe second shock, it was sufficient to throw the U.S. ship ‘Monagahela’\r\nhigh and dry.[74]\r\n\r\nAnother American ship, the ‘Wateree,’ was also lost in 1868 by being\r\nswept a quarter of a mile inland by the sea wave which inundated\r\nArequippa.\r\n\r\nMuch of the great destruction which occurred at the time of the great\r\nLisbon earthquake was due to a series of great sea waves, thirty to\r\nsixty feet higher than the highest tide, which swamped the town. These\r\ncame in about an hour after the town had been shattered by the motion\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\nThe first motion in the waters was their withdrawal, which was\r\nsufficient to completely uncover the bar at the mouth of the Tagus.\r\nAt Cadiz, the first wave, which was the greatest, is said to have been\r\nsixty feet in height. Fortunately the devastating effect which this\r\nwould have produced was partially warded off by cliffs.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Jamaica earthquake (1692) the sea drew back for a\r\ndistance of a mile.\r\n\r\nIn South America sea waves are common accompaniments of large\r\nearthquakes, and they are regarded with more fear than the actual\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nOn October 28, 1724, Lima was destroyed, and on the evening of that day\r\nthe sea rose in a wave eighty feet over Callao. Out of twenty-three\r\nships in the harbour, nineteen were sunk, and four others were carried\r\nfar inland. The first movement which is usually observed is a drawing\r\nback of the waters, and this is so well known to precede the inrush of\r\nlarge waves, that many of the inhabitants in South America have used it\r\nas a timely warning to escape towards the hills, and save themselves\r\nfrom the terrible reaction which, on more than one occasion, has so\r\nquickly followed.\r\n\r\nAt Caldera, near to Copiapo, on May 9, 1877, which was the time when\r\nIquique was devastated, the first motion which was observed in the sea\r\nwas that it silently drew back for over 200 feet, after which it rose\r\nas a wave over five feet high. At some places the water came in as\r\nwaves from twenty to eighty feet in height.\r\n\r\nAt Talcahuano, on the coast of Chili, in 1835, there was a repetition\r\nof the phenomena which accompanied the destruction of Penco in 1730\r\nand 1751. About forty minutes after the first shock, the sea suddenly\r\nretired. Soon afterwards, however, it returned in a wave twenty feet\r\nhigh, the reflex of which swept everything towards the sea. These\r\nphenomena were repeated three times.[75]\r\n\r\nWhen Callao and Lima were destroyed, in 1746, the sea first drew back,\r\nthen came in as waves, four or five minutes after the earthquake.\r\nAltogether, between October 28 and February 24, 451 shocks were\r\ncounted. At one time the sea came in eighty feet above its usual\r\nlevel. One account says that the large waves came in forty-one and a\r\nhalf hours after the first shock, and seventeen and a half hours after\r\ncomparative tranquillity had prevailed.[76]\r\n\r\nAt the eruption of Monte Nuovo, near Naples, in September 27, 1538, the\r\nwater drew back forty feet, so that the whole gulf of Baja became dry.\r\n\r\nIn 1696, at the time of the Catanian earthquake, the sea is said to\r\nhave gone back 2,000 fathoms. Instances are recorded where the sea has\r\nreceded several miles.\r\n\r\nThe time taken for the flowing back of the sea is usually very\r\ndifferent. Sometimes it has only been five or six minutes, whilst at\r\nother times over half an hour, and there are records where the time is\r\nsaid to have been still longer.\r\n\r\nThus, at the earthquake of Santa (June 17, 1678), the sea is stated to\r\nhave gone as far back as the eye could reach, and did not rise again\r\nfor twenty-four hours, when it flooded everything.\r\n\r\nIn 1690 at Pisco the sea went back two miles, and did not return for\r\nthree hours. When it returns it does so with violence, and examples of\r\nthe heights to which it may reach have been given. The greatest sea\r\nwave yet recorded, according to Fuchs, is one which, on October 6,\r\n1737, broke on the coast of Lupatka, 210 feet in height.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, cases known where the sea has returned as gradually\r\nas it went out. Thus, on December 4, 1854, when Acapulco was\r\ndestroyed, the sea is said to have returned as gently as it went out.\r\n\r\nWhen sea waves have travelled long distances from their origin, as,\r\nfor instance, whenever a South American wave crosses the Pacific to\r\nJapan, the phenomena which are observed are like those which were\r\nobserved at Acapulco; the sea falls and rises, at intervals of from ten\r\nminutes to half an hour, to heights of from six to ten feet, without\r\nthe slightest appearance of a wave. Its phenomenon is like that of an\r\nunusually high tide, which repeats itself several times per hour. Even\r\nif we watch distant rocks with a telescope, although the surface of the\r\nocean may be as smooth as the surface of a mirror, there is not the\r\nslightest visible evidence of what is popularly called a wave. The sea\r\nbeing once set in motion it continues to move as waves of oscillation\r\nfor a considerable time. In 1877, as observed in Japan, the motion\r\ncontinued for nearly a whole day. The period and amplitude of the rise\r\nand fall were variable, usually it quickly reached a maximum, and then\r\ndied out gradually. As observed in a self-recording tide gauge at San\r\nFrancisco, the disturbance lasted for about four days. A diagram of\r\nthis is here given. In its general appearance it is very similar to the\r\nrecords of other earthquake waves. The large waves represent the usual\r\nsix hours rise and fall of the tides; usually these are fairly smooth\r\ncurves. Superimposed on the large waves are the smaller zigzag curves\r\nof the earthquake disturbance, lasting with greater or less intensity\r\nfor several days. As these curves are drawn to scale—horizontally for\r\nhours, and vertically one fifth inch to the foot, to show the extent of\r\nthe rise and fall—they will be easily understood.\r\n\r\nSometimes, as in the present example, the first movement in the\r\nwaters is that of an incoming wave. In many instances, however, this\r\nobservation may be due to the slow and more gentle phenomena of the\r\nprevious drawing out of the water, which in a steep waste, or when the\r\nwater is rough, would be difficult to observe, not having been remarked.\r\n\r\nThe distance to which these sea waves have extended has usually been\r\nexceedingly great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Record of Tide Gauge at Port Point, San\r\nFrancisco. Showing Earthquake Waves of May 1877.]\r\n\r\nThe sea wave of the Iquique earthquake of May 9, 1877, like many of its\r\npredecessors, was felt across the basin of the whole Pacific, from New\r\nZealand in the south, to Japan and Kamschatka in the north. And but for\r\nthe intervention of the Eurasian and American continents would have\r\nmade itself appreciable over the surface of the whole of our globe. At\r\nplaces on the South American coast, it has been stated that the height\r\nof the waves varied from twenty to eighty feet. At the Samoa Islands\r\nthe heights varied from six to twelve feet. In New Zealand the sea rose\r\nand fell from three to twenty feet. In Australia the heights to which\r\nthe water oscillated were similar to those observed in New Zealand. In\r\nJapan it rose and fell from five to ten feet. In this latter country,\r\nthe phenomena of sea waves which follow a destructive earthquake on the\r\nSouth American coast are so well known that old residents have written\r\nto the local papers announcing the probability of such occurrences\r\nhaving taken place some twenty-five hours previously in South America.\r\nIn this way news of great calamities has been anticipated, details of\r\nwhich only arrived some weeks subsequently. Just as the destructive\r\nearthquakes of South America have announced themselves in Japan, in\r\na like manner the destructive earthquakes of Japan have announced\r\nthemselves upon the tide gauges of California. Similarly, but not so\r\nfrequently, disturbances shake the other oceans of the world.\r\n\r\nFor example, the great earthquake of Lisbon propagated waves to the\r\ncoasts of America, taking on their journey nine and a half hours.\r\n\r\n_Sea waves without earthquakes._—Sometimes we get great sea waves\r\nlike abnormal tides occurring without any account of contemporaneous\r\nearthquakes. Although earthquakes have not been recorded, these ill\r\nunderstood phenomena are usually attributed to such movements.\r\n\r\nSeveral examples of these are given by Mallet. Thus, at 10 A.M. on\r\nMarch 2, 1856, the sea rose and fell for a considerable distance\r\nat many places on the coast of Yorkshire. At Whitby, the tide was\r\ndescribed ebbing and flowing six times per hour, and this to such a\r\ndistance that a vessel entering the harbour was alternately afloat and\r\naground.\r\n\r\nIn 1761, on July 17, a similar phenomena was observed at the same place.\r\n\r\nA like occurrence took place at Kilmore, in the county of Wexford, on\r\nSeptember 16, 1864, when the water ebbed and flowed seven times in the\r\ncourse of two hours and a half. These tides, which appear to have taken\r\nabout five minutes to rise and five minutes to fall, were seen by an\r\nobserver approaching from the west as six distinct ridges of water. The\r\ngeneral character of the phenomena appears to have been very similar to\r\nthat which was produced at the same place by the Lisbon earthquake of\r\n1755; and the opinion of those who saw and wrote about their occurrence\r\nwas that it was due to an earthquake disturbance. Such phenomena are\r\nnot uncommon on the Wexford coast, where they are popularly known as\r\n‘death waves,’ probably in consequence of the lives which have been\r\nlost by these sudden inundations.\r\n\r\nThey have also been observed in other parts of Ireland, the north-east\r\ncoast of England, and in many parts of the globe. They will be again\r\nreferred to under the head of earth pulsations.\r\n\r\n_Cause of sea waves._—Mallet, who in his report to the British\r\nAssociation in 1858, writes upon this last-mentioned occurrence at\r\nconsiderable length, whilst admitting that many may have originated\r\nfrom earthquakes, he thinks it scarcely probable that an earthquake\r\nblow, sufficiently powerful to have produced waves like those observed\r\nat Kilmore, should not have been felt generally throughout the south of\r\nIreland. He, therefore, suggests that sometimes waves like the above\r\nmight be produced by an underwater slippage of the material forming\r\nthe face of a submarine bank, the slope of which by degradation and\r\ndeposition, produced by currents, had reached an angle beyond the\r\nlimits of repose of the material of which it was formed. Mallet does\r\nnot insist upon the existence of these submarine landslips, but only\r\nsuggests their existence as a means of explaining certain abnormal sea\r\nwaves which do not appear to have been accompanied by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nIn the generality of cases sea waves are accompanied by earthquakes,\r\nbut it may often happen that the connection between the two is\r\ndifficult to clearly establish. One simple explanation for the origin\r\nof waves occurring with earthquakes, is, that in consequence of the\r\nearthquake a large volume of water suddenly finds its way into cavities\r\nwhich have been opened, the disturbance produced by the inrush giving\r\nrise to waves.\r\n\r\nA second explanation is, that the land along a shore is caused by an\r\nearthquake to oscillate upwards, the water running off to regain its\r\nlevel. A supposition like this is negatived by the fact that these\r\ndisturbances are felt far away from the chief disturbance, on small\r\nislands. Also, it may be added, that the whole disturbance appears to\r\napproach the land from the sea, and not in the opposite direction.\r\nThus, in the earthquake of Oahu (February 18, 1871), it was remarked\r\nthat the shock was first felt by the ships farthest from the land.[77]\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is that the waves are due to a sudden heaving up\r\nof the bottom of the ocean. If this lifting took place slowly, then\r\nthe first result would be that the water situated over the centres of\r\ndisturbance would flow away radially in all directions from above the\r\narea of disturbance.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the submarine upheaval took place with great rapidity, say\r\nby the sudden evolution of a large volume of steam developed by the\r\nentry of water into a volcanic vent, as the water was heaped above the\r\ndisturbed area, water might run in radially towards this spot.\r\n\r\nSupposing a primary wave to be formed in the ocean by any such causes,\r\nthen the falling of this will cause a second wave to be formed,\r\nexisting as a ring round the first one. The combined action of the\r\nfirst and second wave will form a third one, and so the disturbance,\r\nstarting from a point, will radiate in broadening circles. During the\r\nup and down motion of these waves, the energy which is imparted to any\r\nparticle of water will, on account of the work which it has to do in\r\ndisplacing its neighbours, by frictional resistance, gradually grow\r\nless and less, until it finally dies away. The waves which are the\r\nresult of this motion will also grow less and less.\r\n\r\nIf a series of sea waves were produced by a single disturbance, we see\r\nthat these will be of unequal magnitude. Now, for small waves, the\r\nvelocity with which they travel depends upon the square root of their\r\nlengths; but with large waves, like earthquake waves, the velocity\r\ndepends upon the square root of the depth of water, and these latter\r\ntravel more quickly than the former.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we have a series of disturbances of unequal magnitude\r\nproducing sea waves, which, from the series of shocks which have\r\nbeen felt upon shores subsequently invaded by waves, seems in all\r\nprobability often to have been the case, it is not unlikely that the\r\nwaves of an early disturbance may be overtaken and interfered with by a\r\nseries which followed.\r\n\r\nThese considerations help us to understand the appearance of the\r\nrecords on our tide gauges, and also the phenomena observed by those\r\nwho have recorded tidal waves as they swept inwards upon the land. For\r\ninstance, we understand the reason why sea waves, as observed at places\r\nat different distances from the origin of a disturbance, should be of\r\ndifferent heights. We also see an explanation for the fact that small\r\nwaves should sometimes appear to be interpolated between large ones,\r\nand that these should occur at varying intervals.\r\n\r\nThe fact that whenever a wave is produced, a certain quantity of water\r\nmust be drawn from the level which surrounds it, in order that it\r\nshould be formed, explains the phenomena that the sea is often observed\r\nfirst to draw back. Out in the open ocean it is drawn from the hollow\r\nbetween two waves. As has been pointed out by Darwin, it is like the\r\ndrawing of the water from the shore of a river by a passing steamer.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the height of waves, as observed at places lying\r\nclose to each other, is probably due to the configuration of the coast,\r\nthe interference of outlying islands, reefs, &c.—causes which would\r\nproduce similar effects in the height of tide.\r\n\r\nAs a wave approaches shallow water it gradually increases in height,\r\nits front slope becomes steep, and its rear slope gentle, until finally\r\nit topples over and breaks. This increasing in height of waves is\r\nno doubt connected with the destruction of Talcahuano and Callao,\r\nwhich are situated at the head of shallow bays. Valparaiso, which is\r\non the edge of deep water, has never been overwhelmed.[78] Another\r\ncase tending to produce anomalies in the character of waves would be\r\ntheir reflection and mutual interference, the reflections due to the\r\nconfiguration of the ocean bed and coast lines.\r\n\r\nThe complete phenomena which may accompany a violent submarine\r\ndisturbance are as follows:—\r\n\r\nBy the initial impulse of explosion or lifting of the ground, a ‘great\r\nsea wave’ is generated, which travels shorewards with a velocity\r\ndependent upon its size and the depth of the ocean. At the same\r\ninstant, a ‘sound wave’ may be produced in the air, which travels at a\r\nquicker rate than the ‘great sea wave.’ A third wave which is produced,\r\nis an ‘earth wave,’ which will reach the shore with a velocity\r\ndependent on the intensity of the impulse and the elasticity of the\r\nrocks through which it is propagated. This latter, which travels the\r\nfastest, may carry on its back a small ‘forced sea wave.’ On reaching\r\nthe shore and passing inland, this ‘earth wave’ will cause a slight\r\nrecession of the water as the ‘forced sea wave’ slips from its back.\r\n\r\nAs these ‘forced sea waves’ travel they will give blows to ships\r\nbeneath which they may pass, being transmitted from the bottom of the\r\nocean to the bottom of the ships like sound waves in water. At the\r\ntime of small earthquakes, produced, for example, by the explosion of\r\nsmall quantities of water entering volcanic fissures, or by the sudden\r\ncondensation of steam from such a fissure entering the ocean, aqueous\r\nsound waves are produced, which cause the rattling and vibrating jars\r\nso often noticed on board ships.\r\n\r\n_Phenomena difficult of explanation._—Although we can in this way\r\nexplain the origin and phenomena of sea waves, we must remember, as\r\nKluge has pointed out, that it is not the simple backward and forward\r\nmovement of the ground which produces sea waves, and that the majority\r\nof earthquakes which have occurred in volcanic coasts have been\r\nunaccompanied by such phenomena. Out of 15,000 earthquakes observed on\r\ncoast lines, only 124 were accompanied by sea waves.[79] Out of 1,098\r\nearthquakes catalogued by Perrey for the west coast of South America,\r\nonly nineteen are said to have been accompanied by movements in the\r\nwaters. According to the ‘Geographical Magazine’ (August 1877, p. 207),\r\nit would seem that out of seventy-one severe earthquakes which have\r\noccurred since the year 1500 upon the South American coast many have\r\nbeen accompanied by sea waves. Darwin also remarks, when speaking of\r\nSouth America, that almost every large earthquake has been accompanied\r\nby considerable agitation in the neighbouring sea.[80]\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 1851, when many towns in Chili were destroyed, the sea was\r\nnot disturbed. At the time of the great earthquake of New Zealand (June\r\n23, 1855), although all the shocks came from the sea, yet there was no\r\nflood. The small shock of February 14, however, was accompanied by a\r\nmotion in the sea.\r\n\r\nTo these examples, which have been chiefly drawn from the writings of\r\nFuchs, must be added the fact that the greater number of disturbances\r\nwhich are felt in the north-eastern part of Japan, although they\r\nemanate from beneath the sea, do not produce any visible sea waves.\r\nThey are, however, sufficient to cause a vibratory motion on board\r\nships situated near their origin.\r\n\r\nAnother point referred to by Fuchs, as difficult of explanation,\r\nis, that the water, when it draws back, often does so with extreme\r\nslowness, and farther, in some instances, it has not returned to its\r\noriginal level. That the sea might be drawn back for a period of\r\nfifteen or thirty minutes is intelligible, when we consider the great\r\nlength of the waves which are formed. Cases where it has retired for\r\nseveral hours or days, and when its original level is altered, appear\r\nonly to be explicable on the assumption of more or less permanent\r\nchanges in the levels of the ground. For example, in the earthquake\r\nof 1855 which shook New Zealand, the whole southern portion of the\r\nnorthern island was raised several feet.\r\n\r\nThese sudden alterations in the levels of coast lines have already\r\nbeen referred to.\r\n\r\nOther points which are difficult to understand are the occurrence\r\nof disturbances in the sea at the time of feeble earthquakes, and\r\nwith earthquakes occurring in distant places. As examples of such\r\noccurrences, Fuchs quotes the following: ‘On May 16, 1850, at 4.28\r\nA.M., an earthquake took place in Pesth, and at 7.30 a motion was\r\nobserved in the sea at Livorno. Again, at the time of the earthquake\r\nof December 19, 1850, which shook Heliopolis, a flood suddenly came\r\nin upon Cherbourg.’ May not these phenomena be the result of an earth\r\npulsation, which produced an earthquake at one point, and a sea wave at\r\nanother?\r\n\r\nEqually difficult to understand are the observations when the\r\ndisturbance in the sea has occurred several hours after an earthquake;\r\nas, for instance, at Batavia, in 1852, when there was an interval of\r\ntwo hours; and to this must be added the observations where the motion\r\nof the sea has preceded that of the earthquake—as, for instance, in\r\n1852, at Smyrna. Whilst recognising the fact that it is possible to\r\nsuggest explanations for many of these anomalies, we must also bear\r\nin mind that they are, generally speaking, exceptional, and, in some\r\ninstances, may possibly be due to errors in observations.\r\n\r\n_Velocity of propagation of sea waves, and depth of the ocean._—It\r\nhas long been known to physical science that the velocity with which\r\na given wave is propagated along a trough of uniform depth, holds a\r\nrelation to the depth of the trough.\r\n\r\nIf _v_ is the velocity of the wave, and _h_ the depth of the trough,\r\nthis relation may be expressed as follows:—\r\n\r\n                           _v_^2          (_v_)\r\n                     _h_ = ————— or _h_ = (———)^2\r\n                            _g_           (_k_)\r\n\r\n                  Where _g_ = 32·19 and _k_ = 5·671.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that these two formulæ (the first of which is\r\nknown as Russell’s formula, and the second as Airy’s) are practically\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nThe apparent difference is in the average value assigned to the\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nFor large waves such as we have to deal with, it would be necessary,\r\nif we were desirous of great accuracy, to increase the value of _h_\r\nby some small fraction of itself. We might also make allowance for\r\nthe different values of _g_, according to our position on the earth’s\r\nsurface. With these formulæ at our disposal it is an easy matter, after\r\nhaving determined the velocity with which a wave was propagated, to\r\ndetermine the average depth of the area over which it was transmitted.\r\n\r\nIn making certain earthquake investigations the reverse problem is\r\nsometimes useful—namely, determining the velocity with which a sea wave\r\nhas advanced upon a shown line, from a knowledge of the depth of the\r\nwater in which it has been propagated.\r\n\r\nCalculations of the average depths of the Pacific, dependent on the\r\nvelocity with which earthquake waves have been propagated, have been\r\nmade by many investigators.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, however, in consequence of having assumed the wave to\r\nhave originated on a coast line, when the evidence clearly showed it\r\nto have originated some distance out at sea, the calculations which\r\nhave been made are open to criticism. The average depths which I\r\nobtained for various lines across the Pacific appear to be somewhat\r\nless than the average depth as given by actual soundings. We must,\r\nhowever, remember that the common error in actual soundings is that\r\nthey are usually too great, it being difficult in deep-sea sounding\r\nto determine when the lead actually reaches the bottom. Until oceans\r\nhave been more thoroughly surveyed with the improved forms of sounding\r\napparatus, we shall not be able to verify the truth of the results\r\nwhich have been given to us by earthquake waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                EXAMPLES OF CALCULATIONS ON SEA WAVES.\r\n\r\n1. _The wave of 1854._—This wave originated near Japan, and it was\r\nrecorded on tide gauges at San Francisco, San Diego, and Astoria.\r\n\r\nOn December 23, at 9.15. A.M., a strong shock was felt at Simoda in\r\nJapan, which, at 10 o’clock, was followed by a large wave thirty feet\r\nin height. The rising and falling of the water continued until noon.\r\nHalf an hour after, the movement became more violent than before. At\r\n2.15 P.M. this agitation decreased, and at 3 P.M. it was comparatively\r\nslow. Altogether there were five large waves.\r\n\r\nOn December 23 and 25, unusual waves were recorded upon the\r\nself-registering tide gauges at San Francisco, San Diego, and Astoria.\r\n\r\nAt San Francisco three sets of waves were observed. The average time of\r\noscillation of one of the first set was thirty-five minutes, whilst one\r\nof the second and third sets was almost thirty-one minutes.\r\n\r\nAt San Diego three series of waves were also shown, but with average\r\ntimes of oscillation of from four to two minutes shorter than the waves\r\nat San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco waves appear to indicate a recurrence of the same\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe record at San Diego shows what was probably the effect of a\r\nseries of impulses, the heights increasing to the third wave, then\r\ndiminishing, then once more renewed, after which it died away.\r\n\r\nThe result of calculations based on these data were:—\r\n\r\n +---------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+\r\n |               |  Distance  |    Time    |Velocity|   Depth of   |\r\n |               |geographical|     of     |in feet |   ocean in   |\r\n |               |   miles    |transmission|per sec.|   fathoms    |\r\n +---- ----------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+\r\n |               |            |  h.  m.    |        |              |\r\n | Simoda to San |    4917    |  12  13    |  545   |     2100     |\r\n |   Diego       |            |            |        |              |\r\n | Simoda to San |    4527    |  12  39    |  528   | 2500 or 2230 |\r\n |   Francisco   |            |            |        |              |\r\n +---------------+------------+------------+--------+--------------+\r\n\r\nThe difference for the depths in the San Francisco path depends whether\r\nthe length of the waves is reckoned at 210 or 217 miles. The length of\r\nthe waves on the San Diego path were 186 or 192 miles.[81]\r\n\r\n_The wave of 1868._—On August 11, 1868, a sea wave ruined many cities\r\non the South American coast, and 25,000 lives were lost. This wave,\r\nlike all the others, travelled the length and breadth of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, at Hakodate, it was observed by Captain T. Blakiston, R.A.,\r\nwho very kindly gave me the following account:\r\n\r\nOn August 15, at 10.30 A.M., a series of bores or tidal waves\r\ncommenced, and lasted until 3 P.M. In ten minutes there was a\r\ndifference in the sea level of ten feet, the water rising above high\r\nwater and falling below low water mark with great rapidity. The\r\nordinary tide is only two and a half to three feet. The disturbance\r\nproducing these waves originated between Iquique and Arica, in about\r\nlat. 18.28 S. at about 5 P.M. on August 13. In Greenwich time this\r\nwould be about 13h. 9m. 40s. August 13. The arrival of the wave at\r\nHakodate in Greenwich time would be about 14h. 7m. 6s. August 14:\r\nthat is to say, the wave took about 24h. 57m. to travel about 8,700\r\nmiles, which gives us an average rate of about 511 feet per second.\r\nThese waves were felt all over the Pacific. At the Chatham Islands they\r\nrushed in with such violence that whole settlements were destroyed. At\r\nthe Sandwich Islands the sea oscillated at intervals of ten minutes for\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nComparing this wave with the one of 1877 we see that one reached\r\nHakodate with a velocity of 511 feet per second, whilst the other\r\ntravelled the same distance at 512 feet per second.\r\n\r\nAn account of this earthquake wave has been given by F. von Hochstetter\r\n(‘Über das Erdbeben in Peru am 13.

The result of my own investigation about this disturbance, the\r\norigin of which, by several methods of calculation, is shown to have\r\nbeen beneath the ocean, near 71° 5′ west long., and 21° 22′ south lat.,\r\nare given on next page.\r\n\r\nDr. Geinitz considers that his calculated depths of the ocean and those\r\nobtained by actual soundings are in accordance, a result which is\r\ndiametrically opposed to that which I have obtained.\r\n\r\nThis difference between my calculations and those of Dr. Geinitz,\r\nHochstetter, and others, chiefly rests on the origin we have assigned\r\nfor the sea waves. Dr. Geinitz, for instance, although he says that\r\nthe origin of the 1877 earthquake was not on the continent but to the\r\nwest in the ocean, bases all his calculations on the assumption that\r\nthe _centrum_ was at or near to Iquique, and the time at which that\r\ncity was disturbed was the time at which the waves commenced to spread\r\nacross the ocean. This time is 8.25 P.M. At this time, however, it\r\nappears that the waves must have been more than double the distance\r\nbetween the true origin and Iquique, from Iquique on their way towards\r\nthe opposite side of the Pacific. Introducing this element into the\r\nvarious calculations which have been made respecting the depth of the\r\nPacific Ocean as derived from observations on earthquake waves—which\r\nelement, insomuch as the waves appear to have come in to inundate the\r\nland some time after the shock, needs to be introduced—we reduce the\r\nvelocity of transit of the earthquake wave and, consequently, the\r\nresultant depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\n Key:\r\n   A Distance from the origin in miles (calculated in great circles)\r\n   B Velocity in feet per second\r\n +-----------+---------+---------+-----+-----+---+-------+--------+---------+\r\n |           |         | Arrival |Time |     |   |Depth  |        |Interval |\r\n |           |         | of wave |taken|     |   |of the | Height | between |\r\n |           |Longitude|   in    | by  | A   | B |ocean  |  of    |waves in |\r\n |           |         |Greenwich|wave |     |   |in feet| waves  | minutes |\r\n |           |         |mean time|     |     |   |       |        |         |\r\n +-----------+---------+---------+-----+-----+---+-------+--------+---------+\r\n |           |  °  ′   |day h. m.|h. m.|     |   |       |        |         |\r\n |Origin     |         |         |     |     |   |       |        |         |\r\n |  of wave  | 71  5 W.| 9 12  59|     |     |   |       |        |         |\r\n |San        |         |               |     |   |       |        |         |\r\n |  Francisco|122 32   |10  2  28|13 29|4,578|498| 7,721 |  9 in. |         |\r\n |Callao     | 77 15   | 9 17   9| 4 10|  658|231| 1,657 |        |         |\r\n |Iquique    | 70 14½  | 9 13  21| 0 22|   87|348| 3,770 | 20 ft. |22       |\r\n |Cobija     | 70 21   | 9 13  19| 0 20|   80|352| 3,857 | 30 „   |         |\r\n |Mejillones | 70 35   | 9 13  27| 0 28|  108|339| 3,587 | 35 „   |15 or 45 |\r\n |Chanaral   | 71 34   | 9 15  26| 2 27|  455|272| 2,309 |        |10       |\r\n |Coquimbo   | 71 24   | 9 15  15| 2 16|  508|328| 3,363 |        |30       |\r\n |Valparaiso | 71 38   | 9 16  16| 3 17|  695|310| 3,000 |        |         |\r\n |Concepcion | 73  5   | 9 16  52| 3 53|  928|350| 3,824 |        |12 to 15 |\r\n |Honolulu   |157 55   |10  3  52|14 53|5,694|561| 9,807 |34 to   |25       |\r\n |           |         |         |     |     |   |       |  54 ft.|         |\r\n |Hilo       |155  3   |10  3   5|14  6|5,506|563|10,217 |30 or   |{3 or 15 |\r\n |           |         |         |     |     |   |       |   8  „ |{18 or 27|\r\n |Kahuliu    |156 43   |10  3  12|14 13|5,611|579|10,437 |        |         |\r\n |Samoa      |171 41 W.|10  3  57|14 58|5,773|566| 9,972 | 12 ft. |10       |\r\n |Taurauga   |176 11 E.|10  8  15|19 16|5,615|427| 5,697 |        |         |\r\n |Wellington |174 30   |10  7  22|18 23|5,574|445| 6,168 | 11 „   |10       |\r\n |Akaroa     |172 59   |10  7  28|18 29|5,542|440| 6,031 |        |         |\r\n |Lyttelton  |172 45   |10  7  29|18 30|5,558|441| 6,055 |        |         |\r\n |Kameishi   |140 50   |10 12  37|23 38|8,844|549| 9,378 |  6 „   |15       |\r\n |Hakodate   |140 50   |10 14   7|25  8|8,778|512| 8,169 |  7 „   |20       |\r\n +-----------+---------+---------+-----+-----+---+-------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Geinitz’s paper there are also some slight differences in the\r\ntimes at which the earthquake phenomena were observed at various\r\nlocalities. These, however, are but of minor importance. At the end\r\nof the paper by Dr. Geinitz two interesting tide gauge records are\r\nintroduced, one from Sydney and the other from Newcastle. These appear\r\nto show a marked difference in the periods of the sea waves at these\r\ntwo places.[84]\r\n\r\n_Comparison of velocities of wave-transit which have been actually\r\nobserved, with velocities which ought to exist from what we know of\r\nthe depth of the Pacific by actual soundings._—From a chart given in\r\n‘Petermann’s Geograph. Mittheilungen,’ Band xxiii. p. 164, 1877, it is\r\npossible to draw approximate sections on lines in various directions\r\nacross the bed of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nFrom the origin of the shock to Japan (Kameishi) the line would be as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  about 7,441 miles       15,000  feet deep\r\n        1,100   „         18,000      „\r\n          160   „         27,000      „\r\n           80   „         12,000      „\r\n           60   „          6,000      „\r\n\r\nOn account of the Tuscarora and Belkap Deeps this would be the most\r\nirregular line over which the wave had to travel.\r\n\r\nFrom the origin to New Zealand (Wellington) the line would be\r\n\r\n  about 5,274 miles       15,000 feet deep.\r\n    „     300  „          12,000   „\r\n\r\nFrom the origin to Samoa the line would be\r\n\r\n  about 5,773 miles       15,000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nFrom the origin to the Sandwich Islands (Honolulu) the line would be\r\n\r\n  almost 6,634 miles      15,000 feet deep\r\n  and       60   „        12,000     „\r\n\r\nBy Scott-Russell’s rule, or, what is almost identically the same, by\r\nAiry’s general formula, we can calculate how long it would take such\r\nwaves as we have been speaking about to travel over the different\r\nportions of each of these lines, and by adding these times together we\r\nobtain the time taken to travel across any one line. I have made these\r\ncalculations, but as I get in every case answers which are too small, I\r\nthink it unnecessary to give them.\r\n\r\nThe actual times taken to travel the distances just referred to were,\r\n\r\n  To Japan (Kameishi)               23 hr. 38 min.\r\n   „ New Zealand (Wellington)       18  „  23  „\r\n   „ Samoa                          14  „  58  „\r\n   „ Sandwich Islands (Honolulu)    14  „  53  „\r\n\r\nFrom San Francisco to Simoda the line is almost 3,567 miles, 3,000\r\nfathoms deep, 840 miles, 2,500 fathoms deep, and 120 miles 1,000\r\nfathoms deep. This gives an average depth of about 2,854 fathoms. Bache\r\ncalculated the depth at 2,500 fathoms.\r\n\r\nIf we are to consider that, because the sea wave at Simoda came in\r\nsome time after the land shock had been felt, the origin of this\r\nearthquake, instead of being at Simoda, was some distance out at sea,\r\nthis calculated depth would be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                 DETERMINATION OF EARTHQUAKE ORIGINS.\r\n\r\n  Approximate determination of an Origin—Earthquake-hunting\r\n    in Japan—Determinations by direction of motion—Direction\r\n    indicated by destruction of buildings—Direction determined by\r\n    rotation—Cause of rotation—The use of time observations—Errors\r\n    in such observations—Origin determined by the method of\r\n    straight lines—The method of circles, the method of hyperbolas,\r\n    the method of co-ordinates—Haughton’s method—Difference in time\r\n    between sound, earth, and water waves—Method of Seebach.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most practical problems which can be suggested to the\r\nseismologist is the determination of the district or districts in any\r\ngiven country from which earthquake disturbances originate. With a\r\nmap of a country before us, shaded with tints of different intensity\r\nto indicate the relative frequency of seismic disturbance in various\r\ndistricts, we at once see the localities where we might dwell with\r\nthe least disturbance, and those we should seek if we wish to make\r\nobservational seismology a study. Before erecting observatories for\r\nthe systematic investigation of earthquakes in a country, it would\r\nbe necessary for us, in some way or other, to examine the proposed\r\ncountry to find out the most suitable district. The special problem\r\nof determining _approximately_ the origin or origins of a set of\r\nearthquakes would be given to us. Having made this preliminary\r\ninvestigation, the next point is, by means of observatories so\r\narranged that they could always work in conjunction with each other,\r\nto determine the origins more accurately. By knowing the origin from\r\nwhich a set of shocks spring we know the general direction in which\r\nwe may expect the most violent disturbances, and we can arrange our\r\nseismometers accordingly.\r\n\r\n_Approximate determination of origins._—In 1880 I obtained a tolerably\r\nfair idea of the distribution of seismic energy throughout Japan, by\r\ncompiling the facts obtained from some hundreds of communications\r\nreceived from various parts of the country respecting the number of\r\nearthquakes that had been felt.\r\n\r\nThe communications were replies to letters sent to various residents\r\nin the country and to a large number of public officers. By taking\r\nthese records, in conjunction with the records made by instruments, it\r\nwas ascertained that in Japan alone there were certainly 1,200 shocks\r\nfelt during the year, that is to say, three or four shocks per day.\r\nThe greater number of these shocks were felt along the eastern coast,\r\ncommencing at Tokio, in the south, and going northwards to the end of\r\nthe main island. These shocks were seldom felt on the west coast. It\r\nappeared as if the central range of mountains formed a barrier to their\r\nprogress. Similarly, ranges of mountains to the south-west of Tokio\r\nprevented the shocks from travelling southwards. Proceeding in this way\r\nthe conclusion was arrived at that the west coast, the southern part\r\nof Japan, and the islands of Shikoku and Kiushiu, had their own local\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\n_Earthquake-hunting._—These preliminary enquiries having shown that\r\nthe northern part of Japan was a better district for seismological\r\nobservations than the southern half, the next step was to subject the\r\nnorthern half to a closer analysis. This analysis was commenced by\r\nsending to all the important towns, from thirty to one hundred miles\r\ndistant from Tokio, bundles of postcards. These were entrusted to the\r\nlocal government offices with a request that each week one of these\r\ncards would be returned to Tokio stating the number of shocks felt.\r\nIn this way it was quickly discovered that the majority of shakings\r\nemanated from the north and east, and seldom, if ever, passed a heavy\r\nrange of mountains to the south. The barricade of postcards was then\r\nextended farther northwards, with the result of surrounding the origin\r\nof certain shocks amongst the mountains, whilst others were traced to\r\nthe sea shore. By systematically pursuing earthquakes it was seen that\r\nmany shocks had their origin beneath the sea—they shook all the places\r\non the north-east coast, but it was seldom that they crossed through\r\nthe mountains, forming the backbone of the island, to disturb the\r\nplaces on the west coast.\r\n\r\nThe actual results obtained in three months by this method of working\r\nare shown in the accompanying map, which embraces the northern half of\r\nthe main island of Nipon and part of Yezo. The shaded portion of the\r\nmap indicates the mountainous districts, which are traversed by ranges\r\nvarying in height from about 2,000 and 7,000 feet. The dotted lines\r\nshow the boundaries of the more important groups of earthquakes which\r\nwere recorded.\r\n\r\nI. is the western boundary of earthquakes, which at places to the\r\neastward are usually felt somewhat severely. Some of these have been\r\nfelt the most severely at or near Hakodadi, whilst farther south their\r\neffects have been weak. Occasionally the greatest effect has been near\r\nto Kameishi. Sometimes these earthquakes terminate along the western\r\nboundaries of III. or IV., not being able to pass the high range of\r\nmountains which separate the plain of Musashi from Kofu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Northern Japan. Mountainous districts shaded\r\nwith oblique lines.]\r\n\r\nII. is the boundary of a shock confined to the plain which surrounds\r\nKofu. These earthquakes are evidently quite local. Many of the\r\ndisturbances have evidently originated beneath the ocean, having come\r\nin upon the land in the direction of the arrows A or B.\r\n\r\nIII. This line indicates the boundary of a group of shocks which are\r\noften experienced in Tokio. These may come in the directions D, E,\r\nor F. It is probable that some of them originate to the eastward of\r\nYokohama, on or near to the opposite peninsula.\r\n\r\nIV. V. and VI. The earthquakes bounded by these lines probably\r\noriginate in the directions C or D.\r\n\r\nVII. The earthquakes bounded by this line probably come from the\r\ndirection E.\r\n\r\nVIII. This line gives us the boundary of earthquakes which may come\r\nfrom the direction B.\r\n\r\nThe above boundaries sometimes do not extend so far to the westward as\r\nthey are shown. At other times, groups like V. and VI. extend farther\r\nto the south-west. These earthquake boundaries, which so clearly show\r\nthe effects of high mountains in preventing the extension of motion,\r\nhave been drawn up, not from single earthquakes, but from a large\r\nseries of earthquakes which have been plotted upon blank maps, and are\r\nnow bound together to form an atlas. To give an idea of the material\r\nupon which I have been working, I may state that between March 1 and\r\nMarch 10, 1882, I received records of no less than thirty-four distinct\r\nshocks felt in districts between Hakodate and Tokio, and for each of\r\nthese it is quite possible to draw a map. In addition to the boundaries\r\nof disturbances given in the accompanying map, other boundaries might\r\nbe drawn for shocks which were more local in their character. The\r\ngroups which contained the greatest number of shocks are III., IV.,\r\nV., VI., and VII. By work of this description it was found that a very\r\nimportant group of earthquakes might be studied by a line of stations\r\ncommencing at Saporo in the north, passing through Hakodate, down the\r\neast coast of the main island, to Tokio or Yokohama in the south. A\r\nfurther aid to the study of this group, together with the study of\r\nan important local group, might be effected with the help of a few\r\nadditional stations properly distributed on the plain of Musashi, which\r\nsurrounds Tokio. With this example before us it will be recognised that\r\nthe choice of sites for a connected set of seismological observatories\r\nwill often be more or less a special problem. If earthquake stations\r\nwere to be placed in different directions around Tokio without\r\npreliminary investigation, it is quite possible that some of them might\r\nbe so situated that they would seldom if ever work in conjunction with\r\nthe remaining observatories, and therefore be of but little value.\r\nAnd this remark must equally apply to districts in other portions\r\nof the globe. The method is crude, and, so far as actual earthquake\r\norigins are concerned, it only yields results which are approximate.\r\nThe crudeness and the want of absoluteness in the results is, however,\r\nmore than counterbalanced by the certainty with which we are enabled\r\nto express ourselves with regard to such results as are obtained. Even\r\nwhen working with the best instruments we have at our command, unless\r\nwe are employing some elaborate system, this method of working gives a\r\nmost valuable check upon our instrumental records, and enables us to\r\ninterpret them with greater confidence.\r\n\r\n_Determination of earthquake origins from the direction of motion._—If\r\nwe assume that an earthquake is propagated from a centre as a series\r\nof waves, in which normal vibrations are conspicuous, and obtain at\r\ntwo localities, not in the same straight line with the origin, and\r\nsufficiently far separated from each other, the direction of movement\r\nof these normal motions, by drawing lines parallel to these directions\r\nthrough our two stations, the lines would intersect at a point above\r\nthe required origin. If instead of two points we had three, or, better\r\nstill, a large number, the results we should obtain ought to be\r\nstill more certain. Unfortunately, it seems that earthquakes seldom\r\noriginate from a given point, and, further, normal motions are not\r\nalways (sufficiently) prominent. Sometimes, as has already been shown\r\nin the chapters on earthquake motion, they may be non-existent. It is\r\nprobable, however, that difficulties of this sort are more usually\r\nassociated with non-destructive earthquakes. Mallet regards the\r\ndestructive effects of an earthquake as almost solely due to normal\r\nmotions. If this be true, for destructive earthquakes, the problem is\r\nshorn of many of its difficulties. In cases where normal vibrations\r\nare not prominent, where we have only transverse vibrations, motions\r\ndue to the interference of normal or transverse motions, or directions\r\nof motions due to the topographical or geological nature through which\r\nthe disturbance has passed, the determination of the origin of an\r\nearthquake by observations on the direction in which the ground has\r\nbeen moving appears to be a problem which is practically without a\r\nsolution. We will, therefore, only consider the determination of the\r\norigin of those earthquakes which have predominating directions in\r\ntheir movements, which directions we will consider as normal ones.\r\nThe question which is, then, before us, is the determination of the\r\ndirection of these normal movements. First of all we may take the\r\nevidence of our senses. In exceptional cases these have given results\r\nwhich closely approximate to the truth, but in the majority of cases\r\nsuch results are not to be relied upon, as the inhabitants of a town\r\nwill, for the same shock, give directions corresponding to all points\r\nof the compass. Much, no doubt, depends upon the situation of the\r\nobserver, and much, perhaps, upon his temperament. If he is sitting\r\nin a room alone, and is accustomed to making observations on an\r\nearthquake, on feeling the earthquake, if he concentrates his attention\r\non the direction in which he is being moved, his observations may be\r\nof value. If, however, he is not so situated, and his attention is\r\nnot thus concentrated, his opinions, unless the motion has been very\r\ndecided in its character, are usually of but little worth.\r\n\r\n_Direction determined from destruction of buildings._—When an observer\r\nfirst sees a town that has been partially shattered by an earthquake,\r\nall appears to be confusion, and it is difficult to imagine that in\r\nsuch apparent chaos we are able to discover laws. If, however, we take\r\na general view of this destruction and compare together similarly\r\nbuilt buildings, it is possible to discover that similar and similarly\r\nsituated structures have suffered in a similar manner. By carefully\r\nanalysing the destruction we are enabled to infer the direction in\r\nwhich the destroying forces have acted. It was chiefly by observing the\r\ncracks in buildings, and the direction in which bodies were overthrown\r\nor projected, that Mallet determined the origin of the Neapolitan\r\nearthquake. From the observations given in Chapter VII. it would appear\r\nthat, with destructive earthquakes, walls which are transverse to the\r\ndirection of motion are most likely to be overturned, whilst, with\r\nsmall earthquakes, these walls are the least liable to be fractured.\r\n\r\nFrom a critical examination of the _general_ nature of the damage\r\ndone on the buildings of a town, earthquake observers have shown that\r\nthe direction of a shock may often be approximately determined. The\r\ndirection in which a body having a regular form like a prismatic\r\ngravestone or a cylindrical column is overturned sometimes gives the\r\nmeans by which we can determine the direction from which a movement\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n_The rotation of bodies._—It has often been observed that almost all\r\nlarge earthquakes have caused objects like tombstones, obelisks,\r\nchimneys, &c., to rotate.\r\n\r\nOne of the most natural and at the same time most simple explanations\r\nis to suppose that during the shock there had been a twisting, or\r\nbackward and forward screw-like motion in the ground. Amongst the\r\nItalians and the Mexicans earthquakes producing an effect like this are\r\nspoken of as ‘vorticosi.’ In the Calabrian earthquake, not only were\r\nbodies like obelisks twisted on their bases, but straight rows of trees\r\nseem to have been left in interrupted zigzags. These latter phenomena\r\nhave been explained upon the assumption of the interference of direct\r\nwaves and reflected waves, the consequence of which being that points\r\nin close proximity might be caused to move in opposite directions.\r\nReflections such as these would be most likely to occur near to the\r\njunction of strata of different elasticity, and it may be remarked that\r\nit is often near such places that much twisting has been observed.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which it is possible for twisting to have taken place\r\nwould be by the interference of the normal and transverse waves which\r\nprobably always exist in an earthquake shock, or by the meeting of\r\nthe parts of the normal wave itself, one having travelled in a direct\r\nline from the origin, whilst the other, travelling through variable\r\nmaterial, has had its direction changed.\r\n\r\nMallet, however, has shown that the rotation may have been in many\r\ncases brought about without the supposition of any actual twisting\r\nmotion of the earth—a simple backward and forward motion being quite\r\nsufficient. If one block of stone rests upon another, and the two are\r\nshaken backwards and forwards in a straight line, and if the vertical\r\nthrough the centre of gravity of the upper block does not coincide with\r\nthe point where there is the greatest friction between the blocks,\r\nrotation must take place. If the vertical through the centre of gravity\r\nfalls on one side of the centre of friction, the rotation would be in\r\none direction, whilst, if on the other side, the rotation would be in\r\nthe opposite direction.\r\n\r\nAlthough the above explanation is simple, and also in many cases\r\nprobably true, it hardly appears sufficient to account for all the\r\nphenomena which have been observed.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, if the stones in the Yokohama cemetery, at the time\r\nof the earthquake of 1880, had been twisted in consequence of the cause\r\nsuggested by Mallet, we should most certainly have found that some\r\nstones had turned in one direction whilst others had been twisted in\r\nanother. By a careful examination of the rotated stones, I found that\r\nevery stone—the stones being in parallel lines—had _revolved in the\r\nsame direction_, namely in a direction opposite to that of the hands of\r\na watch.\r\n\r\nAs it would seem highly improbable that the centre of greatest friction\r\nin all these stones of different sizes and shapes should have been at\r\nthe same side of their centres of gravity, an effect like this could\r\nonly be explained by the conjoint action of two successive shocks, the\r\ndirection of one being transverse to the other.\r\n\r\nAlthough fully recognising the sufficiency of two transverse shocks\r\nto produce the effects which have been observed in Yokohama, I will\r\noffer what appears to me to be the true explanation of this phenomenon:\r\nit was first suggested by my colleague, Mr. Gray, and appears to be\r\nsimpler than any with which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\nIf any columnar-like object, for example a prism which the basal\r\nsection is represented by A B C D (see fig. 30), receives a shock at\r\nright angles to B C, there will be a tendency for the inertia of the\r\nbody to cause it to overturn on the edge B C. If the shock were at\r\nright angles to D C, the tendency would be to overturn on the edge D C.\r\nIf the shock were in the direction of the diagonal C A, the tendency\r\nwould be to overturn on the point C. Let us, however, now suppose the\r\nimpulse to be in some direction like E G, where G is the centre of\r\ngravity of the body. For simplicity we may imagine the overturning\r\neffect to be an impulse given through G in an opposite direction—that\r\nis, in the direction G E. This force will tend to tip or make the body\r\nbear heavily on C, and at the same time to whirl round C as an axis,\r\nthe direction of turn being in the direction of the hands of a watch.\r\nIf, however, the direction of impulse had been E′ G, then, although the\r\nturning would still have been round C, the direction would have been\r\n_opposite_ to that of the hands of a watch.\r\n\r\nTo put these statements in another form, imagine G E′ to be resolved\r\ninto two components, one of them along G C and the other at right\r\nangles, G F. Here the component of the direction G C tends to make the\r\nbody tip on C, whilst the other component along G F causes revolution.\r\nSimilarly G E may be resolved into its two components G C and G F′, the\r\nlatter being the one tending to cause revolution.\r\n\r\nFrom this we see that if a body has a rectangular section, so long\r\nas it is acted upon by a shock which is parallel to its sides or to\r\nits diagonals, there ought not to be any revolution. If we divide\r\nour section A B C D up into eight divisions by lines through these\r\ndirections, we shall see that any shock the direction of which passes\r\nthrough any of the octants which are shaded will cause a _positive_\r\nrevolution in the body—that is to say, a revolution corresponding in\r\nits direction to that of the movements of the hands of a watch; whilst\r\nif its direction passes through any of the remaining octants the\r\nrevolution will be _negative_, or opposite to that of the hands of a\r\nwatch. From the direction in which any given stone has turned, we can\r\ntherefore give two sets of limits between one of which the shock must\r\nhave come.\r\n\r\nFurther, it will be observed that the tendency of the turning is to\r\nbring a stone, like the one we are discussing, broadside on to the\r\nshock; therefore, if a stone with a rectangular cross section has\r\nturned sufficiently, the direction of a shock will be parallel to one\r\nof its faces, but if it has not turned sufficiently it will be more\r\nnearly parallel to its faces in their new position than it was to its\r\nfaces when in their original position.\r\n\r\nIf a stone receives a shock nearly parallel with its diagonal, on\r\naccount of its instability it may turn either positively or negatively\r\naccording as the friction on its base or some irregularity of surface\r\nbearing most influence. Similarly, if a stone receives a shock parallel\r\nto one of its faces, the twisting may be either positive or negative,\r\nbut the probability is that it would only turn slightly; whereas in the\r\nformer case, where the shock was nearly parallel to a diagonal, the\r\nturning would probably be great.\r\n\r\n_Determination of direction from instruments._—When speaking about\r\nearthquakes it was shown, as the result of many observations, that\r\nthe same earthquake in the space of a few seconds, although it may\r\nsometimes have only one direction of motion, very often has many\r\ndirections of motion. In certain cases, therefore, our records, if we\r\nassume the most permanent motions to be normal ones, give definite and\r\nvaluable results. In other cases it is necessary to carefully analyse\r\nthe records, comparing those taken at one station with those taken at\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable fact which has been pointed out in reference to\r\nartificial earthquakes produced by exploding charges of gunpowder or\r\ndynamite, and also with regard to certain earthquakes, is that the\r\ngreatest motion of the ground is _inwards_, towards the point from\r\nwhich the disturbance originated. Should this prove the rule, it gives\r\na means of determining, not only the direction of earthquake, but the\r\nside from which it came.\r\n\r\n_Determination of earthquake origins by time observations._—The times\r\nat which an earthquake was felt at a number of stations are among the\r\nmost important observations which can be made for the determination of\r\nan earthquake origin. The methods of making time observations, and the\r\ndifficulties which have to be overcome, have already been described.\r\nWhen determining the direction from which a shock has originated, or\r\ndetermining the origin of the shock by means of time observations,\r\nit has been usual to assume that the velocity of propagation of the\r\nshock has been uniform from the origin. The errors involved in this\r\nassumption appear to as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. We know from observations on artificial earthquakes that the\r\nvelocity of propagation is greater between stations near to the origin\r\nof the shock than it is between more remote stations; and also the\r\nvelocity of propagation varies with the initial force which produced\r\nthe disturbance. If our points of observation are sufficiently close\r\ntogether as compared with their distance from the origin of the\r\ndisturbance, it is probable that errors of this description are small\r\nand will not make material differences in the general results.\r\n\r\n2. We have reasons for believing that the transit velocity of an\r\nearthquake is dependent on the nature of the rocks through which it\r\nis propagated. Errors which arise from causes of this description\r\nwill, however, be practically eliminated if our observation points are\r\nsituated on an area sufficiently large, so that the distribution of the\r\ncauses tending to alter the velocity of a shock balance each other. It\r\nmust be remarked, that causes of this description may also produce an\r\nalteration in the direction of our shock.\r\n\r\nOther errors which may sometimes enter into our results, when\r\ndetermining the origin of shocks by means of observations on\r\nvelocities, are the assumptions that the disturbance has travelled\r\nalong the surface from the _epicentrum_ and not in a direct line from\r\nthe _centrum_. Again, it is assumed that the origin is a point, whereas\r\nit may possibly be a cavity or a fissure. Lastly, if we desire extreme\r\naccuracy, we must make due allowance for the sphericity of the earth\r\nand the differences of elevation of the observing stations.\r\n\r\nI. _The method of straight lines._—Given a number of pairs of points\r\nA_{0}, A_{1}, B_{0}, B_{1}, C_{0}, C_{1}, &c., at each of which the\r\nshock was felt simultaneously, to determine the origin.\r\n\r\nTheoretically if we bisect the line which joins A_{0} and A_{1} by a\r\nline at right angles to A_{0}, A_{1}, and similarly bisect the lines\r\nB_{0}, B_{1}, C_{0}, C_{1}, all these bisecting lines _a__{0}, _a__{1},\r\n_b__{0}, _b__{1}, _c__{0}, _c__{1}, &c., ought to intersect in a point,\r\nwhich point will be the _epicentrum_ or the point above the origin.\r\n\r\nThis method will fail, first, if A_{0}, A_{1}, B_{0}, B_{0}, C_{0},\r\nC_{1} form a continuous straight line, or if they form a series of\r\nparallel lines.\r\n\r\nHopkins gives a method based on a principle similar to the one which\r\nis here employed—namely, given that a shock arrives simultaneously\r\nat _three_ points to determine, the centre. In this case, the\r\nrelative positions of the three points, where the time of arrival was\r\nsimultaneous, must be accurately known, and these three points must\r\nnot lie in a straight line, or the method will fail. For practical\r\napplication the problem must be restricted to the case of three points\r\nwhich do not lie nearly in the same straight line.\r\n\r\nII. _The method of circles._—Given the times _t__{0}, _t__{1}, _t__{2},\r\n&c., at which a shock arrived at a number of places A_{0}, A_{1},\r\nA_{2}, &c., to determine the position from which the shock originated.\r\n\r\nSuppose A_{0} to be the place which the shock reached first, and that\r\nit reached A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, &c., successively afterwards.\r\n\r\n  Let     _t__{1} - _t__{0} = _a_\r\n          _t__{2} - _t__{0} = _b_\r\n          _t__{3} - _t__{0} = _c_, &c.\r\n\r\nWith A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, &c. as centres, describe circles with radii\r\nproportional to the known qualities _a_, _b_, _c_, &c., and also a\r\ncircle which passes through A_{0} and touches these circles. The centre\r\nof the last circle will be the _epicentrum_. The radii proportional to\r\n_a_, _b_, _c_, &c. may be represented by the quantities _ax_, _bx_,\r\n_cx_, &c., where _x_ is the velocity of propagation of the shock.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the times at which the shock arrived at three\r\nplaces might alone be sufficient. If, instead of taking the times of\r\narrival of a shock, the arrival of a sea wave be taken, the result\r\nwould be a closer approximate to the absolute truth.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this method is not a direct one, but is\r\none of trial. If, however, an imaginary case be taken, and three\r\ngiven points of observation, A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}, be plotted on a\r\npiece of paper, it will be found that it is not a difficult matter to\r\ndetermine two numbers proportional to _a_ and _b_ which will allow\r\nyou to draw two circles so that they may be touched by a third circle\r\ndrawn through A_{0}. This problem has practically been applied in the\r\ncase of the arrival of a sea wave at a number of places on the South\r\nAmerican coast, at the time of the earthquake of May 9, 1877. This is\r\nillustrated as follows. The places which were chosen were Huanillos,\r\nTocopilla, Cobija, Iquique, Mejillones.\r\n\r\nIn the following table the first column gives the times at which the\r\nsea wave arrived at each of these places in Iquique time; in the second\r\ncolumn the difference between these times and the time at which it\r\nreached Huanillos is given; in the third column the distances through\r\nwhich a sea wave, propagated at the rate of 350 feet per second, could\r\ntravel during the intervals noted in the second column is given.\r\n\r\n +------------+----------+----------+------------+\r\n |            | Arrival  |Time after| Distance at|\r\n |            |  of sea  |arrival at|350 feet per|\r\n |            |   wave   | Huanillos|   second   |\r\n +------------+----------+----------+------------+\r\n |            |  h. m.   |  minutes |   miles    |\r\n | Huanillos  |  8  30   |     0    |     0      |\r\n | Tocopilla  |  8  32   |     2    |     8      |\r\n | Cobija     |  8  38   |     8    |    32      |\r\n | Iquique    |  8  40   |    10    |    40      |\r\n | Mejillones |  8  46   |    16    |    64      |\r\n +------------+----------+----------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe distances marked in the third column are used as radii of the\r\ncircles drawn round the places to which they respectively refer.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the circle drawn to touch the circles of the first\r\ncolumn, and at the same time to pass through Huanillos, is marked C.\r\n\r\nThe position from which the shock originated appears therefore to have\r\noccurred very near to a place lying in Long. 7° 15′ W. and Lat. 21° 22′\r\nS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nThe actual operations which were gone through in making the\r\naccompanying map were as follows. First, the places with which we had\r\nto deal were represented on a map in orthographical projection, the\r\ncentre of projection being near to the centre of the map. This was\r\ndone so that the measurements which were made upon the map might be\r\nmore correct than those we should obtain from an ordinary chart where\r\nthis portion of the world was not the centre of projection. Next, a\r\nnumber was taken as equal to the velocity with which the sea wave had\r\ntravelled. The first velocity taken was about 400 feet per second—this\r\nbeing about the velocity with which, theoretically, it must have\r\ntravelled in an ocean having a depth equal to that indicated upon the\r\ncharts—also it seemed to have travelled at this rate from the various\r\ntimes of arrival as recorded at places along the coast. Circles were\r\nthen drawn round Tocopilla, Cobija, Iquique, and Mejillones with radii\r\nequal to 2, 8, 10, and 15, each multiplied by (60 × 400). It was then\r\nseen _by trial_ that it was impossible to draw a single circle which\r\nshould touch four circles and also pass through Huanillos. These four\r\ncircles were, in fact, too large. Four new but smaller circles, which\r\nare shown in the map, were next drawn, their radii being respectively\r\nequal to the numbers 2, 8, 10, and 16, each multiplied by (60 × 350),\r\nand it was found that a circle, with a centre C, could be drawn which\r\nwould practically touch the four circles, and at the same time would\r\npass through Huanillos.\r\n\r\nIII. _The method of hyperbolas._—The method which I call that of\r\nhyperbolas is only another form of the method of circles. It is,\r\nhowever, useful in special cases, as, for instance, where we have the\r\ntimes of arrival of earthquakes at only two stations. Between Tokio\r\nand Yokohama, at which places I frequently obtain tolerably accurate\r\ntime records, the method has been applied on several occasions with\r\nadvantage. In the preceding example let us suppose that the only time\r\nrecords which we had were for Huanillos and Mejillones, and that the\r\nwave was felt at the latter place sixteen minutes or 960 seconds\r\nafter it was experienced at the former. Calling these places H and M\r\nrespectively, round M draw a circle equal to the 960 multiplied by\r\nthe velocity with which the wave was propagated. It is then evident\r\nthat the origin of this disturbance must be the centre of a circle\r\nwhich passes through H and touches the circle drawn round M. Join H\r\nM, cutting the circle round M in Y. Bisect Y H in V. It is evident\r\nthat V is one possible origin for the disturbance. Next, from M, in\r\nthe direction of H, draw any line M Z P; join Z H; bisect Z H at right\r\nangles by the line O P N. Because PH = PZ, it is evident that P is\r\na second possible origin. Proceeding in this way a series of points\r\nlying to the right and left of V on the curve R V T may be found, and\r\nwe may therefore say that the origin lies somewhere in the curve R\r\nV T. By increasing or decreasing our velocity we vary the position\r\nof the curve R V T, and, instead of a line on which our origin may\r\nbe, we obtain a band. As the assumed velocity increases, the circle\r\nround M becomes larger, and has its limit when it passes through H,\r\nwhere the two arms of the curve R V T will close together and form a\r\nprolongation of the line M Y H as the assumed velocity diminishes.\r\nThe circle round M becomes smaller until it coincides with the point\r\nM. At such a moment the curve R V T opens out to form a straight line\r\nbisecting M H at right angles. The curve R V T is a hyperbola with a\r\nvertex V and foci H and M. Inasmuch as PM - PH = a constant quantity.\r\nIf we have the time given at which the shock or wave arrived at a third\r\nstation as at Iquique, it is evident that a second hyperbola R′ V′ T′\r\nmight be drawn with Iquique and Huanillos as foci, and that the mutual\r\nintersection of these two hyperbolas with a third hyperbola, having for\r\nits foci Iquique and Mejillones, would give the origin of the wave.\r\nThe obtaining of a mutual intersection would depend on the assumed\r\nvelocity, and the accuracy of the result, like that of the method\r\nof circles, would depend upon the trials we made. The method here\r\nenunciated may be carried farther by describing hyperboloids instead\r\nof hyperbolas, the mutual intersection of which surfaces would, in the\r\ncase of an earth wave, give the actual origin or _centrum_ rather than\r\nthe point above the origin or _epicentrum_.\r\n\r\nIV. _The method of co-ordinates._—Given the times at which a shock\r\narrived at five or more places, the position of which we have marked\r\nupon a map, or chart, to determine the position on the map of the\r\ncentre of the shock, its depth, and the velocity of propagation.\r\n\r\nCommencing with the place which was last reached by the shock, call\r\nthese places _p_, _p__{1}, _p__{2}, _p__{3}, and _p__{4}, and let the\r\ntimes taken to reach these places from the origin be respectively _t_,\r\n_t__{1}, _t__{2}, _t__{3}, and _t__{4}.\r\n\r\nThrough _p_ draw rectangular co-ordinates, and with a scale measure the\r\nco-ordinates of _p__{1}, _p__{2}, _p__{3}, and _p__{4}, and let these\r\nrespectively be _a__{1}, _b__{1}; _a__{2}, _b__{2}; _a__{3}, _b__{3};\r\n_a__{4}, _b__{4}. Then if _x_, _y_, and _z_ be the co-ordinates of the\r\norigin of the shock, _d_, _d__{1}, _d__{2}, _d__{3}, and _d__{4}, the\r\nrespective distances of _p_, _p__{1}, _p__{2}, _p__{3}, and _p__{4}\r\nfrom this origin, and _v_ the velocity of the shock, we have\r\n\r\n  1. _x_^2 + _y_^2 + _z_^2 = _d_^2 = _v_^2 _t_^2\r\n  2.

Call these\r\nrespectively _m_, _p_, _q_, and _r_. Suppose _t_ known, then\r\n\r\n                          _t__{1} = _t_ - _m_\r\n                          _t__{2} = _t_ - _p_\r\n                          _t__{3} = _t_ - _q_\r\n                          _t__{4} = _t_ - _r_.\r\n\r\nSubtracting equation No. 1 from each of the equations 2, 3, 4, and 5,\r\nwe obtain,\r\n\r\n  _a__{1}^2 + _b__{1}^2 - 2_a__{1} _x_ - 2_b__{1} _y_\r\n      = _v_^2 (_t__{1}^2 - _t_^2) = _v_^2 (_m_^2 - 2_t_ _m_)\r\n\r\n  _a__{2}^2 + _b__{2}^2 - 2_a__{2} _x_ - 2_b__{2} _y_\r\n      = _v_^2 (_t__{2}^2 - _t_^2) = _v_^2 (_p_^2 - 2_t_ _p_)\r\n\r\n  _a__{3}^3 + _b__{3}^2 - 2_a__{3} _x_ - 2_b__{3} _y_\r\n      = _v_^2 (_t__{3}^2 - _t_^2) = _v_^2 (_q_^2 - 2_t_ _q_)\r\n\r\n  _a__{4}^2 + _b__{4}^2 - 2_a__{4} _x_ - 2_b__{4} _y_\r\n      = _v_^2 (_t__{4}^2 - _t_^2) = _v_^2 (_r_^2 - 2_t_ _r_)\r\n\r\nNow let _v_^2 = _u_, and 2_v_^2 _t_ = _w_.\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n  1. 2_a__{1} _x_ + 2_b__{1} _y_ + _u_ _m_^2 - _n_ _m_\r\n      = _a__{1}^2 + _b__{1}^2\r\n\r\n  2. 2_a__{2} _x_ + 2_b__{2} _y_ + _u_ _p_^2 - _n_ _p_\r\n      = _a__{2}^2 + _b__{2}^2\r\n\r\n  3. 2_a__{3} _x_ + 2_b__{3} _y_ + _u_ _q_^2 - _n_ _q_\r\n      = _a__{3}^2 + _b__{3}^2\r\n\r\n  4. 2_a__{4} _x_ + 2_b__{4} _y_ + _u_ _r_^2 - _n_ _r_\r\n      = _a__{4}^2 + _b__{4}^2\r\n\r\nWe have here four simple equations containing the four unknown\r\nquantities _x_, _y_, _u_, and _w_.\r\n\r\n_x_ and _y_ determine the origin of the shock. The absolute velocity\r\n_v_ equals √ _u_. From _v_ and _w_ we obtain _t_. Substituting\r\n_x_, _y_, _v_, and _t_ in the first equation we obtain _z_.\r\n\r\nWe have here assumed that the points of observation have all about the\r\nsame elevation above sea level.\r\n\r\nIf it is thought necessary to take these elevations into account, a\r\nsixth equation may be introduced.\r\n\r\nIf the propagation of the wave is considered as a horizontal one, as\r\nwould be done when calculating the position of the _epicentrum_ or\r\npoint above the origin, by means of the times of arrival of a sea wave,\r\nthe ordinate _z_ of the first five equations would be omitted. Working\r\nin this way the resulting four equations, viz.\r\n\r\n  2_a__{1} _x_ + 2_b__{1} _y_ + _u__m_^2 - _w__m_^2 = _a__{1}^2 + _b__{1}^2\r\n              &c.                      &c.              &c.\r\n\r\nremained unchanged.\r\n\r\nApplying this method to the same example as that used as illustration\r\nfor the two previous methods, we obtain for the co-ordinates of\r\nMejillones, Iquique, Cobija, Tocopilla, and Huanillos, measured in\r\ngeographical miles, and the times in Iquique time at which the wave\r\nreached each, as given in the following table; _ox_ and _oy_ being,\r\ndrawn through Mejillones.\r\n\r\n +------------+--------------------------------+---------------+\r\n |            |         Co-ordinates           |Time of arrival|\r\n +------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n |            |      OX        |      OY       |  h.  m.       |\r\n | Mejillones | _a_     or   0 | _b_     or  0 |  8  46 p. m.  |\r\n | Iquique    | _a_{1}_ or 150 | _b_{1}_ or 96 |  8  40   „    |\r\n | Cobija     | _a_{2}_ or  36 | _b_{2}_ or 14 |  8  38   „    |\r\n | Tocopilla  | _a_{3}_ or  66 | _b_{3}_ or 31 |  8  32   „    |\r\n | Huanillos  | _a_{4}_ or 102 | _b_{4}_ or 58 |  8  30   „    |\r\n +------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nFrom this data we find the co-ordinates _x_ and _y_ of this origin to\r\nbe 85·8 and 56·7; whilst the velocity of propagation = 45 feet per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nMeasuring these ordinates upon the map, we obtain a centre lying very\r\nnear Long. 71° 5′ W. and Lat. 21° 22′ S., a position which is very near\r\nto that which has already been obtained by other methods.\r\n\r\nIf instead of Huanillos we substitute the ordinates and time of arrival\r\nof the sea wave for Pabalon de Pica, another point for the origin will\r\nbe obtained lying farther out at sea. To obtain the best result, the\r\nmethod to be taken will evidently be, first to reject those places\r\nat which it seems likely that some mistake has been made with the\r\ntime observations, and then with the remaining places to form as many\r\nequations as possible, and from these to obtain a mean value. This\r\nis a long and tedious process, and as the time observations of this\r\nparticular earthquake are probably one and all more or less inaccurate,\r\nit is hardly worth while to follow the investigation farther.\r\n\r\nIn this example, as in the preceding ones, it will be observed that\r\nit has been sea waves that have been dealt with, rather than earth\r\nvibrations. It is evident, however, that these latter vibrations may be\r\ndealt with in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nIn these determinations it will also have been observed that it\r\nis assumed that the disturbance has radiated from a centre, and,\r\ntherefore, approached the various stations in different directions.\r\nIf we assume that we have three stations very near to each other as\r\ncompared with their distances from the origin, so that we can assume\r\nthat the wave fronts at the various stations were parallel, the\r\ndetermination of the direction in which the wave advanced appears to be\r\nmuch simplified. The determination of the direction in which a wave has\r\npassed across three stations was first given by Professor Haughton.\r\n\r\n_Haughton’s method._—Given, the time of an earthquake shock at three\r\nplaces, to determine its horizontal velocity and coseismal line.\r\n\r\nThe solution of this is contained in the formula\r\n\r\n                       _a_ (_t_{2}_ - _t_{1}_) sin β\r\n    tan φ = ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————.\r\n            _c_ (_t_{3}_ - _t_{2}_) + _a_ (_t_{2}_ - _t_{1}_ cos β\r\n\r\nWhen A, B, and C are three stations at which a shock is observed at\r\nthe times _t_{1}_, _t_{2}_, and _t_{3}_; _a_, _b_, and _c_ are the\r\ndistances between A, B, and C, and φ is the angle made by the coseismal\r\nlines _x_ A _x_, _y_ B _y_, and the line A B, which are assumed to be\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\nThis I applied in the case of the Iquique earthquake, but owing to the\r\nsmallness of the angles between the three stations A, B, and C, the\r\nresult was unsatisfactory. The problem ought to be restricted, first,\r\nto places which are a long distance away from a centre, and, secondly,\r\nto places which are not nearly in a straight line. This problem may be\r\nsolved more readily by geometrical methods. Plot the three stations A,\r\nB, and C on a map, join the two stations between which there was the\r\ngreatest difference in the time observation. Let these, for example,\r\nbe A and C. Divide the line A C at point D, so that A D : D C as the\r\ninterval between the shock felt at A and B is to the interval between\r\nthe shock felt at B and C. The line B D will be parallel to the\r\ndirection in which the wave advanced.\r\n\r\n_The difference in time of the arrival of two disturbances._—In the\r\nvarious calculations which have been made to determine an origin\r\nbased on the assumption of a known or of a constant velocity, we have\r\nonly dealt with a single wave, which may have been a disturbance in\r\nthe earth or in the water. A factor which has not yet been employed\r\nin this investigation is the difference in time between the arrival\r\nof two disturbances; one propagated, for instance, through the\r\nearth, and the other, for example, through the ocean. The difference\r\nin the times of the arrival of two waves of this description is a\r\nquantity which is so often recorded that it is well not to pass it\r\nby unnoticed. To the waves mentioned we might also add sound waves,\r\nwhich so frequently accompany destructive earthquakes, and, in some\r\nlocalities, as, for instance, in Kameishi, in North Japan, are also\r\ncommonly associated with earthquakes of but small intensity. It was by\r\nobserving the difference in time between the shaking and the sound in\r\ndifferent localities that Signor Abella was enabled to come to definite\r\nconclusions regarding the origin of the disturbances which affected the\r\nprovince of Neuva Viscoya in the Philippines, in 1881; the places where\r\nthe interval of time was short, or the places where the two phenomena\r\nwere almost simultaneous, being, in all probability, nearer to the\r\norigin than when the intervals were comparatively large. I myself\r\napplied the method with considerable success when seeking for the\r\norigin of the Iquique earthquake of 1877. The assumptions made in that\r\nparticular instance were, first, that the velocity of the disturbance\r\nthrough the earth was known, and, secondly, that the velocity with\r\nwhich a sea wave was propagated was also known.\r\n\r\nA method similar to the above was first suggested by Hopkins. It\r\ndepended on the differences of velocity with which normal and\r\ntransversal waves are propagated.[85]\r\n\r\n_Seebach’s method._—To determine the true velocity of an earthquake,\r\nthe time of the first shock, and the depth of the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nLet the straight line M, _m__{1}, _m__{2}, _m__{3} represent the\r\nsurface of the earth shaken by an earthquake. For small earthquakes, to\r\nconsider the surface of the earth as a plane will not lead to serious\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nIf an earthquake originates at C, then to reach the surface at M it\r\ntraverses a distance _h_ in the time _t_. To reach the surface at M_{1}\r\nit traverses a distance _h_ + _x__{1} in a time _t__{2}. If _v_ equals\r\nthe velocity of propagation,\r\n\r\n                          _h_             _h_ + _x__{1}\r\n               then _t_ = ———, _t_{1}_ = —————————————,\r\n                          _v_                 _v_\r\n\r\n                               _h_ + _x__{2}\r\n                     _t_{2}_ = —————————————, &c.\r\n                                    _v_\r\n\r\nSeebach now says that _if we have given the position of_ M _or\r\nepicentrum of the shock_, and draw through it rectangular axes like M\r\n_m_{3}_ and M T_{3}, and lay down on M _m_{3}_ in miles the distances\r\nfrom M of the various stations which have been shaken, and in equal\r\ndivisions for minutes lay down on M T_{3} the differences of time at\r\nwhich M, _m_{1}_, _m_{2}_, &c. were shaken, then M_{1} T_{1}, M_{2}\r\nT_{2}, &c. are the co-ordinates of points on an hyperbola. The degree\r\nof exactness with which this hyperbola is in any given case constructed\r\nis a check upon the accuracy of the time observations and the position\r\nof the _epicentrum_. The apex of the hyperbola is the _epicentrum_.\r\n\r\nThe intersection of the asymptote with the ordinate axis is the time\r\npoint of the first shock, which, because the scale for time and\r\nfor space were taken as equal, gives the absolute position of the\r\n_centrum_. This intersection is shown by dotted lines. Knowing the\r\nposition of the _centrum_, we can directly read from our diagram how\r\nfar the disturbance has been propagated in a given time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                  THE DEPTH OF AN EARTHQUAKE CENTRUM.\r\n\r\n  The depth of an earthquake centrum—Greatest possible depth of an\r\n    earthquake—Form of the focal cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Depth of centrum._—The first calculations of the depth at which an\r\nearthquake originated were those made by Mallet for the Neapolitan\r\nearthquake of 1857. These were made on the assumption that the earth\r\nwave radiated in straight lines from the origin, and, therefore, at\r\npoints at different distances from the _epicentrum_ it had different\r\nangles of emergence. These angles of emergence were chiefly calculated\r\nfrom the inclination of fissures produced in certain buildings, which\r\nwere assumed to be at right angles to the direction of the normal\r\nmotion. If we have determined the _epicentrum_ of an earthquake and\r\nthe muzoseismal circle, and make either the assumption that the angle\r\nof emergence in this circle has been 45° or 54° 44′ 9″ (see page\r\n54), it is evidently an easy matter by geometrical construction to\r\ndetermine the depth of the _centrum_. Höfer followed this method when\r\ninvestigating the earthquake of Belluno.\r\n\r\nOther methods of calculation which have been employed are based on\r\ntime observations, as, for instance, the method of Seebach, the method\r\nof co-ordinates, the method of hyperboloids or spheres (see pages\r\n200–212).\r\n\r\nBy means of a number of lines parallel to twenty-six angles of\r\nemergence, drawn in towards the seismic vertical, Mallet found that\r\ntwenty-three of these intersected at a depth of 7⅛ geographical miles.\r\nThe maximum depth was 8⅛ geographical miles, and the minimum depth 2¾\r\ngeographical miles.\r\n\r\nThe mean depth was taken at a depth of 5¾ geographical miles where,\r\nwithin a range of 12,000 feet, eighteen of the wave paths intersected\r\nthe seismic vertical.\r\n\r\nThe point where these wave paths start thickest is at a depth not\r\ngreater than three geographical miles, and this is considered to be the\r\nvertical depth of the focal cavity itself.\r\n\r\nFor the Yokohama earthquake of 1880, from the indications of\r\nseismometers, and by other means, certain angles of emergence were\r\nobtained, leading to the conclusion that the depth of origin of that\r\nearthquake might be between 1½ and 5 miles.\r\n\r\nPossibly, perhaps, the earthquake may have originated from a fissure\r\nthe vertical dimensions of which was comprised between these depths.\r\n\r\nA source of error in a calculation of this description is that the\r\nvertical motions may have been a component of transverse motions or\r\nperhaps due to the slope of surface waves.\r\n\r\nThe following table of the depths at which certain earthquakes have\r\noriginated has been compiled from the writings of several observers.\r\n\r\n +---------------------------------+-----------------------------+\r\n |                                 |           In feet           |\r\n +----------------+----------------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n |                |                | Minimum |   Mean  | Maximum |\r\n | Rhineland      | 1846 (Schmidt) |         | 127,309 |         |\r\n | Sillien        | 1858 (Schmidt) |         |  86,173 |         |\r\n | Middle Germany | 1872 (Seebach) |  47,225 |  58,912 |  70,841 |\r\n | Herzogenrath   | 1873 (Lasaulx) |  16,553 |  36,516 |  56,477 |\r\n | Neapolitan     | 1857 (Mallet)  |  16,705 |  34,930 |  49,359 |\r\n | Yokohama       | 1880 (Milne)   |   7,920 |  17,260 |  26,400 |\r\n +----------------+----------------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\nA table similar to this has been compiled by Lasaulx.[86]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the determination for the two last disturbances\r\nthese calculations have been made with the assistance of the method\r\nof Seebach, which depends, amongst other things, on the assumptions\r\nof exact time determinations, direct transmission of waves from the\r\ncentrum, and a constant velocity of propagation.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that our observations of time are practically accurate, it\r\nappears that the other assumptions may often lead to errors of such\r\nmagnitude that our results may be of but little value.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said respecting the velocity with which earth\r\ndisturbances are propagated, it seems that these velocities may vary\r\nbetween large limits, being greatest nearest to the origin.\r\n\r\nIf we refer to Seebach’s method, we shall see that a condition of this\r\nkind would tend to make the differences in time between various places,\r\nas we recede from the _epicentrum_, greater than that required for the\r\nconstruction of the hyperbola. The curve which is obtained would, in\r\nconsequence, have branches steeper than that of the hyperbola, and the\r\nresultant depth, obtained by the intersection of the asymptotes of this\r\ncurve with the seismic vertical, indicates an origin which may be much\r\ntoo great.\r\n\r\nAnother point worthy of attention, which is common to the method\r\nof Mallet as well as to that of Seebach, is the question whether\r\nthe shock radiates directly from the origin, or is propagated from\r\nthe origin more or less vertically to the surface, and then spreads\r\nhorizontally. We know that earthquakes, both natural and artificial,\r\nmay be propagated as undulations on the surface of the ground, and\r\nthat the vertical motion of the latter, as testified by the records\r\nof well-constructed instruments, has no practical connection with the\r\ndepth from which the disturbance originated.\r\n\r\nIn cases like these, the direction of cracks in buildings, and other\r\nphenomena usually accredited to a normal radiation, may in reality be\r\ndue to changes in inclination of the surface on which the disturbed\r\nobjects rested. When our points of observation are at a distance from\r\nthe _epicentrum_ of the disturbance which, as compared with the depth\r\nof the same, is not great, calculations or observations based on the\r\nassumption of a direct radiation of the disturbance may possibly lead\r\nto results which are tolerably correct. The calculations of Mallet\r\nfor the Neapolitan earthquake appear to have been made under such\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nFor smaller earthquakes, and for places at a distance from the seismic\r\nvertical of a destructive earthquake, the results which are deduced\r\nfrom the observations on shattered buildings, and all observations\r\nbased upon the assumption of direct radiation, we must accept with\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nAnother error which may enter into calculations of this description\r\nis one which has been discussed by Mallet at some length. This is the\r\neffect which the form and the position of the focal cavity may have\r\nupon the transmission of waves.\r\n\r\nShould the impulse originate from a point or spherical cavity, then\r\nwe might, in a homogeneous medium perhaps, regard the isoseismals as\r\nconcentric circles, and expect to find that equal effects had been\r\nproduced at equal distances from the _epicentrum_. Should, however,\r\nthis cavity be a fissure, it is evident that even in a homogeneous\r\nmedium the inclination of the plane of such a cavity will have\r\nconsiderable effect upon the form of the waves which would radiate from\r\nits two walls.\r\n\r\nFor example, let it be assumed that the first impulse of an earthquake\r\nis due to the sudden formation of a fissure, rent open from its centre,\r\nand that the waves leave the walls at all points normal to its surface.\r\nThen, as Mallet points out, it is evident that the disturbance will\r\nspread out in ellipsoidal waves, the greatest axis of which will be\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the fissure.\r\n\r\nBy taking a number of cases of fissures lying in various directions\r\nand drawing the ellipsoidal waves which would result from an elastic\r\npressure, like that of steam suddenly admitted into such cavities, the\r\ndifferences in effect which would be simultaneously produced by these\r\nwaves on reaching the surface can be readily understood. The following\r\nexample of an investigation on this subject will serve as an example to\r\nillustrate the general nature of the many other cases which might be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\nLet a disturbance simultaneously originate from all points of the\r\nfissure _f_ _f_. This will spread outwards in ellipsoidal shells to\r\nthe surface of the earth _e_ _e_. The major axis of these ellipsoidal\r\nshells will be the direction of greatest effect. In the direction _c_\r\n_d_ the waves will plunge into the earth, and places to the right side\r\nof the fissure will, to use an expression due to Stokes, when speaking\r\nof analogous phenomena connected with sound, be in _earthquake shadow_.\r\nThe same expression has been employed, somewhat differently, when\r\nspeaking of the effects produced on buildings.\r\n\r\nFor places, like _s_ and _p_, situated at equal distances from the\r\nseismic vertical, it is evident that the intensity of the shock will be\r\ndifferent, and also its time of arrival. It will also be observed that\r\nthe isoseismals will take the form of ovals or distorted ellipses, the\r\nlarger or fuller end of which being to the left of the fissure.\r\n\r\nOther cases, like those just given, which are discussed by Mallet in\r\nhis account of the Neapolitan earthquake, are where the fissure forms\r\nthe division between materials of different elasticities. In the hard\r\nand more elastic material the waves will be more crowded, the velocity\r\nof a wave particle will be greater, and the transit will be quicker\r\nthan in the less elastic medium.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the distance of equal effect from the seismic\r\nvertical will be greatest in the direction of the more compressible\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nUnless these considerations are kept carefully before the mind when\r\ninvestigating the depth and, we may add, the position and form of the\r\ncentrum of an earthquake, serious errors may arise.\r\n\r\n_Greatest depth of an earthquake origin._—A curious but instructive\r\ncalculation which Mallet made was a determination of the greatest\r\npossible depth at which an earthquake may occur. This calculation is\r\nbased upon the idea that the impulsive effect of an earthquake has an\r\nintimate relationship with the height of neighbouring volcanoes, the\r\ncolumn of lava supported on a volcanic cone being a measure of the\r\ninternal pressure tending to rupture the adjacent crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nMitchell, in 1700, virtually propounded this idea, when he suggested that\r\nthe velocity of propagation of an earthquake was related to the height\r\nof such a column.[87]\r\n\r\nMallet showed that there was probably considerable truth in such a\r\nsupposition by appealing to the results of actual observation. The\r\npressure gauge of the Neapolitan district would be Vesuvius, the height\r\nof which has in round numbers varied between 3,500 to 4,000 feet. One\r\nof the most destructive earthquakes in this district—namely, the one of\r\n1857—projected bodies with an initial velocity of about fifteen feet\r\nper second. The Riobamba earthquake, which projected bodies with an\r\ninitial velocity of eighty feet per second, appears to have been the\r\nmost violent earthquake, so far as its impulsive effort is concerned,\r\nof which we have any record. It occurred amongst the Andes, where there\r\nare volcanoes from 16,000 to 21,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nComparing these two earthquakes together, we see that the Riobamba\r\nshock had a destructive power 5·33 times that of the Neapolitan shock,\r\nand we also see that the Riobamba volcanoes were about 5·33 times\r\nhigher than Vesuvius. The accordance in these quantities is certainly\r\ninteresting, and tends to substantiate the idea that volcanoes are\r\nbarometrical-like pressure gauges of a district.\r\n\r\nCarrying the argument still further. Mallet says that if the depth of\r\norigin of earthquakes were the same, then the _area of disturbance_\r\nwould, for like formations and configuration of surface, be a measure\r\nof the earthquake effort, and also some function of the velocity of the\r\nwave. From this we may generally infer ‘that earthquakes, like that of\r\nLisbon, which have a _very great area_ of sensible disturbance, have\r\nalso a very deep seismal focus, and also the greatest depth of seismal\r\nfocus within our planet is probably not greater than that ascertained\r\nfor this Neapolitan earthquake, multiplied by the ratio that the\r\nvelocity of the Riobamba wave bears to that of its wave, or, what is\r\nthe same thing, by the ratio of the altitudes of the volcanoes of the\r\nAndes to that of Vesuvius.’\r\n\r\nNow, as the depth of the Neapolitan shock may be taken at 34,930\r\nfeet, the greatest probable depth of origin of any earthquake impulse\r\noccurring in our planet is limited to 5·333 × 4,930 feet, or 30·64\r\ngeographical miles.\r\n\r\nIngenious as this argument is, we can hardly admit it without certain\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\nFirst, we are called upon to admit the identity of the originating\r\ncause of the volcano and the earthquake—as to what may be the\r\noriginating cause of earthquakes we have yet to refer, but certainly in\r\nthe case of particular earthquakes, as, for instance, those which occur\r\nin countries like Scotland, Scandinavia, and portions of Siberia, the\r\ndirect connection between these phenomena are not at first sight very\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nSecondly, even if we admit the identity of the origin of these\r\nphenomena, it is not difficult to imagine that the fluid pressure\r\nbrought to bear upon certain portions of the crust of the earth may\r\npossibly in many instances be infinitely greater than that indicated\r\nby the height of the column of liquid lava in the throat of a volcano,\r\nthe true height of which we are unable to obtain. Further, in certain\r\ninstances such a column only appears to be a measure of the pressure\r\nupon the crust of the earth in the immediate vicinity of the cone.\r\n\r\nThus, in the Sandwich Islands, we have lava standing in the throat\r\nof the volcano of Mauna Loa 10,000 feet higher than it stands in the\r\ncrater Kilauea, only twenty miles distant. That these columns should be\r\nmeasures of the same pressure, originating in a general subterranean\r\nliquid layer with which they are connected, is a supposition difficult\r\nto satisfactorily substantiate.\r\n\r\nAnother measure of the impulsive efforts which subterranean forces\r\nmay exert upon the crust above them is evidently the height to which\r\nvolcanoes eject materials. Cotopaxi is said to have hurled a 200-ton\r\nblock of stone nine miles. Sir W. Hamilton tells us that in 1779\r\nVesuvius shot up a column of ashes 10,000 feet in height; and Judd\r\ntells us that this same mountain in 1872 threw up vapours and rock\r\nfragments to the enormous height of 20,000 feet. This would indicate an\r\ninitial velocity of 1,131 feet per second.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Mallet’s calculation that thirty miles is the limiting\r\ndepth for the origin of an earthquake, the origin of the Owen’s\r\nValley earthquake of March 1872 was estimated as being at least fifty\r\nmiles.[88]\r\n\r\n_Form of the focal cavity._—Among the various problems which are put\r\nbefore those who study the physics of the interior of our earth it\r\nwould at first sight appear that there was none more difficult than the\r\nattempt to determine the form of the cavity, if it be a cavity, from\r\nwhich an earthquake originates. Almost all investigators of seismology\r\nhave recognised that the birthplace of an earthquake is not a point,\r\nand have made suggestions about its general nature. The ordinary\r\nsupposition is that the earthquake originates from a fissure, and if\r\nthe focus of a disturbance could be laid bare to us it would have the\r\nappearance of a fault such as we so often see exposed on the faces of\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nA strong argument, tending to demonstrate that some of the shakings\r\nwhich are felt in Japan are due to the production of such fissures,\r\nis the fact that the vibrations which are recorded are transverse to\r\na line joining the point of observation and the district from which,\r\nby time observations, we know the shock to have originated. The most\r\nprobable explanation of this phenomena appears to be that one mass of\r\nrock has been sliding across another mass, giving rise to shearing\r\nstrains, and producing waves of distortion.\r\n\r\nThe first seismologist who attacked the problem of finding out the\r\ndimensions and position of such a fissure was Mallet, when working on\r\nthe Neapolitan earthquake of 1857. The reasons that the origin should,\r\nin the first place, have been a fissure, rather than any other form of\r\ncavity, was that such a supposition seemed to be _a priori_ the most\r\nprobable, and, further, that it afforded a better explanation of the\r\nvarious phenomena which were observed, than that obtained from any\r\nother assumption.\r\n\r\nThe method on which Mallet worked to determine the form and position of\r\nthe assumed fissure, which method was subsequently more or less closely\r\nfollowed by other investigators, was as follows:—\r\n\r\nFrom an observation of the various phenomena produced upon the surface\r\nof the disturbed area, a map of isoseismals was constructed. These were\r\nseen, as has been the case with many earthquakes, not to distribute\r\nthemselves in circles round the _epicentrum_, but as distorted oval or\r\nelliptical figures, the major axes of which roughly coincided with each\r\nother. Further, the _epicentrum_, did not lie in the centre of these\r\novals, but was near to the narrow end where they converged.\r\n\r\nThis at once showed, if the reasoning respecting the manner in which\r\nwaves are propagated from an inclined fissure be correct, that the\r\nfissure was at right angles to the major axis of the curves, dipping\r\nfrom their narrow end downwards, in the direction of their larger\r\nwidespread ends.\r\n\r\nThe next weapon which Mallet employed to attack this problem was the\r\nsound which was heard at different points round about the focus. These\r\nsounds appear to have been of the nature of sudden explosive reports\r\naccompanied by rushing, rolling sounds. The form of the area in which\r\nthese sounds were heard was closely similar to that of the first two\r\nisoseismals. Except in the central area of great disturbance, no sound\r\nwas heard to accompany the shock.\r\n\r\nThose at the northern and southern extremity of the sound area all\r\ndescribed what they heard as a ‘low, grating, heavy, sighing rush, of\r\ntwenty to sixty seconds’ duration.’ Those in the middle and towards the\r\neast and west boundaries of this area described a sound of the same\r\ntone, but shorter and more abrupt, and accompanied with more rumbling.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the arguments which were followed in discussing the sound\r\nobservations will be found in the chapter relating to these phenomena.\r\n\r\nA portion of the argument which it is difficult to follow relates to\r\nthe maximum rate at which it can be supposed possible for a fissure to\r\nbe rent in rocks, which rate depends on the density and elasticity of\r\nthese rocks and other constant factors.\r\n\r\nNext it was observed that the paths of the waves drawn on the surface,\r\nalthough generally intersecting in a point, did not do so absolutely,\r\nbut along a line passing through the main focus some 7½ miles in\r\nlength. This, coupled with the observations of sounds, led to the\r\nsupposition that the centre of disturbance, considered horizontally,\r\noriginated along a curved line passing through the chief focus and the\r\nvarious intersections of the wave paths.\r\n\r\nThe last phenomena brought forward to assist in the solution of this\r\ninteresting problem were a study of the tremulous movements that\r\npreceded and followed the shock, and their relation to the sound\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nIf the earthquake originated by the formation of a fissure, after the\r\nrending has gone on for a certain time the focal cavity is enlarged\r\nto a certain extent, and the great shock takes place. This would be\r\nfollowed by concluding tremulous waves. A succession of phenomena like\r\nthose accompanied the shock about which Mallet writes.\r\n\r\nBy observations such as these, coupled with what has been said about\r\nthe maximum and mean depths of the focal cavity, Mallet came to the\r\nconclusion that the focal cavity was a fissure, the rending open of\r\nwhich produced the earthquake. The vertical dimensions of this cavity\r\nwere not more than 5·3 miles, but were probably limited to three miles.\r\n\r\nFrom the intersection of the wave paths upon the surface and the\r\nobserved emergences, this fissure followed horizontally a curve of\r\ndouble flexure, about nine geographical miles in length. The area of\r\nthis fissure was twenty-seven geographical miles. The time of rending\r\nit open in Apennine limestone would be about 7½ seconds, which\r\nshould be the same as the period during which tremors were felt. The\r\ntime actually recorded was six or eight seconds.\r\n\r\nBriefly, this is, then, the line of reasoning which was followed by\r\nMallet in an investigation the results of which are as interesting\r\nas they are startling. Since the line of investigation has been\r\nopened, and the existence of new problems has been indicated, other\r\ninvestigators, although not exactly following Mallet’s method in\r\nall their details, have, when endeavouring to attain the same ends,\r\nemployed similar weapons.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, Seebach, when determining the depth and nature of\r\nthe origin of the earthquake of Middle Germany, reasoned somewhat as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nHad the origin been more or less of a spherical cavity, then the region\r\nof most violent disturbance upon the surface would, according to a\r\ntheorem we have already mentioned, have been upon or near a circle of\r\nabout 8·8 miles in radius round the _epicentrum_. This region, however,\r\nwas found by observation to lie along a curved band about forty miles\r\nin length, altogether on one side of the _epicentrum_.\r\n\r\nTo explain this anomaly Seebach followed Mallet, and assumed that the\r\norigin was not a spherical cavity, but a fissure.\r\n\r\nThe depth and strike of this fissure was determined by the observation\r\nthat the area of greatest disturbance was along a curved line lying\r\nradial to the _epicentrum_. Such a condition it was assumed indicated\r\nthat the fissure of origin must be inclined towards this area of\r\ngreatest disturbance. A line was then drawn from this area to the\r\n_centrum_. A second line at right angles to this one gave the dip of\r\nthe fissure.\r\n\r\nHöfer, when working on the earthquake of Belluno, came to the\r\nconclusion that the disturbance originated from two faults meeting\r\neach other at an angle of 60°. In this determination he was chiefly\r\ninfluenced by the form of a certain homoseist which was of the form of\r\nan elongated ellipse met on one side by a second ellipse, the principal\r\naxes of the two ellipses giving the strike of the two faults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n            DISTRIBUTION OF EARTHQUAKES IN SPACE AND TIME.\r\n\r\n  General distribution of earthquakes—Occurrence along lines—Examples\r\n    of distribution—Italian earthquake of 1873—In Tokio—Extension\r\n    of earthquake boundaries—Seismic energy in relation to\r\n    geological time; to historical time—Relative frequency of\r\n    earthquakes—Synchronism of earthquakes—Secondary earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General distribution of earthquakes._—The records of earthquakes\r\ncollected by various seismologists lead us to the conclusion that\r\nat some time or other every country and every ocean in the world\r\nhas experienced seismic disturbances. In some countries earthquakes\r\nare felt daily, and from what will be said in the chapter on earth\r\npulsations it is not unlikely that every large earthquake might with\r\nproper instrumental appliances be recorded at any point on the land\r\nsurfaces of our globe. The area over which any given earthquake extends\r\nis indeterminate. The area over which an earthquake is sensible is\r\nsometimes very great. The Lisbon shock of 1755 is estimated as having\r\nbeen sensible over an area of 3,300 miles long and 2,700 miles wide,\r\nbut in the form of tremors and pulsations it may have shaken the whole\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe regions in which earthquakes are frequent are indicated in the\r\naccompanying map, which, to a great extent, is a reproduction of a map\r\ndrawn by Mallet. The regions coloured with the darkest tint are those\r\nwhere great earthquakes are the most frequent. The actual number of\r\nearthquakes which have been felt in the differently coloured areas are\r\ngiven, when speaking of the relation of seismic energy to season.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at this chart it must be remembered that if we were\r\nto make a detailed map of any one of the different countries where\r\nearthquakes are frequent, we should find in it all the differences that\r\nwe observe in the general chart. For instance, one portion of Japan,\r\nwhere perhaps sixty shocks are felt per year, would be coloured with\r\na dark tint, whilst other portions of the same country, where there\r\nis only one slight shaking felt every few years, would be left almost\r\nuncoloured. The black dots indicating the position of volcanic vents\r\nare even more general in their signification than the tinted areas.\r\nProfessor Haughton gives for the world a list of 407 volcanoes, 225 of\r\nwhich are active. These numbers are the same as those given by A. von\r\nHumboldt. Of the active volcanoes 172 are on the margin of the Pacific,\r\nand of the total number eight are in Japan. From my own observations\r\nin Japan independently of the Kurile Islands, I have enumerated\r\nfifty-three volcanoes which are either active or have been active\r\nwithin a recent period. In a few years’ time this list will probably be\r\nincreased. I mention this fact to show how very imperfect our knowledge\r\nis respecting the number of volcanic vents existing on our globe. If we\r\nwere in a position to indicate the volcanoes which had been in eruption\r\nduring the last 4,000 years, the probability is that they would number\r\nseveral thousands rather than four or five hundred.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the map shows that earthquakes chiefly occur in\r\nvolcanic and mountainous regions. The most earthquake-shaken regions of\r\nthe world form the boundaries of the Pacific ocean. It may be remarked\r\nthat these boundaries slope beneath the neighbouring ocean at a much\r\nsteeper angle than the boundaries of countries where earthquakes occur\r\nbut seldom. The coasts of South America, Kamschatka, the Kuriles,\r\nJapan, and the Sandwich Islands, for example, have slopes beneath the\r\nPacific from one in twenty to one in thirty. The coasts of Australia,\r\nScandinavia, and the eastern parts of South America, where earthquakes\r\nare practically unknown, have slopes from one in fifty to one in two\r\nhundred and fifty. Many earthquakes have taken place in mid-ocean. In\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean M. Perrey has given about 140 instances of such\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the earthquakes which shake Japan appear to have their\r\norigin in the neighbouring ocean. If we could draw a map of earthquake\r\norigins, it is probable that the greater number of the marks indicating\r\nthese origins would be found to be suboceanic and along lines parallel\r\nto the shores of continents and islands which rise steeply from the\r\nbed of deep oceans. In countries like Switzerland and India, our marks\r\nwould hold a relationship to the mountains of these countries.[89]\r\nLooking at the broad features of the globe, we see on its surface\r\nmany vast depressions. Some of these saucer-like hollows form land\r\nsurfaces, as in central Asia. The majority of these, however, are\r\noccupied by the oceans. Active volcanoes chiefly occur near the rim of\r\nthe hollows which have the steepest slopes. The majority of earthquakes\r\nprobably have their origin on or near the bottom of these slopes. To\r\nthese, however, there are exceptions, as for instance the earthquakes\r\nin the Alps, in the hills of Scotland, and the shakings which are\r\noccasionally felt in countries like Egypt. The earthquakes which shake\r\nthe borders of the Pacific have their origins in, and their effects are\r\nalmost exclusively felt on, the sides of the bounding ridge facing this\r\nocean. In Japan it is the eastern sides of the islands which suffer,\r\nthe western side being almost as free from these convulsions as England.\r\n\r\nSimilar remarks may be made about the eastern side of South America,\r\nespecially the southern portion of the continent. At Buenos Ayres, for\r\nexample, there has been no disturbance since Mendoza was destroyed,\r\nsome twenty years ago. In British Guiana slight shocks are occasionally\r\nfelt in the low delta which forms the settled portion of the colony,\r\nbut they are extremely rare.\r\n\r\n_Disturbances in lines or zones._—It has often been observed that\r\ndisturbances are propagated along the length of mountains or valleys,\r\nand it is but seldom that earthquakes cross them transversely. Thus the\r\nvalleys of the Rhone, the Rhine, and the Danube are lines along which\r\ndisturbances travel.\r\n\r\nThe major axes of the elliptical areas of disturbances which have\r\nshaken India have a general direction parallel to the valley of the\r\nGanges along the flanks of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances which have shaken London appear to have been chiefly\r\neast and west, or along the valley of the Thames. In South America the\r\nline of disturbance is along the western sides of the Andes. Another\r\nline is along the northern coast of the continent through Andalusia\r\nand Caraccas towards the Antilles and Trinidad. The shocks of the\r\nPyrenees are chiefly felt along the southern side of these mountains.\r\nIn the middle and on the northern side they are but seldom felt. This\r\npropagation in lines or zones may in certain cases be apparent rather\r\nthan real. Thus the north and south ranges of mountains in Japan are\r\nmountains almost simultaneously shaken along their eastern flanks,\r\ngiving the impression that an earthquake had originated simultaneously\r\nfrom a fissure parallel to this line, or else, starting at one end,\r\nhad run down their lengths. Time observations have, however, shown\r\nthat such disturbances had their origin at some distance in the ocean,\r\nand, travelling inwards, had reached all points on the flanks of these\r\nmountains almost simultaneously. The same explanation will probably\r\nhold for the so-called linear disturbances of western South America.\r\n\r\nAll earthquake disturbances have probably a tendency to radiate from\r\ntheir source, and are only prevented from doing so by meeting with\r\nheavy mountainous districts, which by their mass and structure absorb\r\nthe energy communicated to them. Much energy is also lost by emergence\r\non the open flanks of a range of mountains. Rather than say that\r\nhigh mountains often bound the extension of an earthquake, or that\r\nearthquakes appear to run along the flanks of such mountains, we might\r\nsay that earthquakes have boundaries parallel to the strike of the\r\nrocks in a given district, that such a direction is the one in which\r\nthe propagation is the easier.\r\n\r\nRossi is of opinion that volcanic fractures play an important part in\r\ngoverning the distribution of seismic disturbances. When a volcano is\r\nformed, a series of starlike fractures are formed round the central\r\ncrater. Secondary craters may indicate the line of these fissures. The\r\nmountains about Rome are regarded as typical of this radial structure.\r\nThe more distant the secondary craters are from the centre of the\r\nsystem, the smaller will they be, and also the younger. If two fissures\r\nintersect we get a larger crater at the junction. Earthquakes are\r\npropagated along the direction of these fissures, whilst the rising\r\nand falling of these lips throw off transverse waves. Rossi adduces\r\nobservations which appear to meet with explanation on such suppositions.\r\n\r\nSuess, who has written upon the earthquakes of lower Austria, shows how\r\nthe majority of the disturbances have had their origin along certain\r\nlines which form a break in the continuity of the Alps. One line runs\r\nnorth-east from Bruck towards Vienna. Near Wiener Neustadt, where the\r\ngreatest number and heaviest shocks have occurred, this line is met by\r\na north-north-west line crossing the Danube and following the valley\r\nof the river Kamp.[90] Hoeffer has drawn similar lines from the head\r\nof the Adriatic, one set running north-north-east to intersect near\r\nLitschau, and the other north-north-west to intersect near Frankfort in\r\nthe valley of the Rhine.[91]\r\n\r\n_Examples of distribution._—A curious example of the distribution of\r\nseismic movement is that of the earthquake of March 12, 1873, worked\r\nout by Professor P. A. Serpieri. This earthquake appears to have been\r\nsimultaneously felt on the Dalmatian coast and in central Italy, in a\r\nregion lying north-east from Rome and south-east from Florence. In both\r\nof these areas the motion was from south-east to north-west. The shock\r\nthen radiated from the central Italian regions, so that at places on\r\nthe western shore of the Adriatic it was felt after it had been felt on\r\nthe Dalmatian coast.\r\n\r\nMany explanations might be offered for this peculiar distribution\r\nof seismic activity. Possibly the shock originated at a great depth\r\nbeneath the bed of the southern part of the Adriatic, and by following\r\nexisting lines of weakness simultaneously reached the surface of the\r\nearth in central Italy and Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nIn Tokio, which is built partly on a flat plain, partly in valleys\r\ndenuded from a low tableland, and partly on the spurs of the tableland\r\nitself, the distribution of earthquakes is a subject yet requiring\r\nattention. Sometimes it has happened that persons in one house have\r\nbeen sufficiently alarmed to escape into the open air, whilst others,\r\nnot more than a mile distant, have not been aware that the city had\r\nbeen shaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.\r\n  Areas almost simultaneously struck from S.E. to N.W. [graphic]\r\n\r\n  Subsequent radial disturbance [graphic]]\r\n\r\n_Extension of earthquake boundaries._—Natural obstructions which may be\r\nsufficient to retard small earthquakes may in certain instances not be\r\nfound sufficient to retard the larger disturbances. Thus the shocks of\r\nCalabria are usually only felt on the western side of the Apennines,\r\nbut instances have occurred when they have crossed this barrier. In\r\n1801 the earthquake of Cumana crossed a branch of the coast range.\r\n\r\nSometimes earthquake boundaries give way, and countries which they\r\nsheltered subsequently become exposed to all disturbances. The true\r\nexplanation of this is probably in a shifting of the centre of seismic\r\nactivity. Thus up to December 14, 1797, although Cumana was often\r\ndevastated, the peninsula of Araya was not hurt. On this date Araya\r\ncommenced to suffer, and has continued to suffer ever since.\r\n\r\nFuchs gives an example of the movement of a seismic centre in the case\r\nof the Calabrian earthquake. The first shock commenced near Oppiedo,\r\nthe second shock commenced four or five miles farther to the north, and\r\nthe third shock had its origin five or six miles still farther, near to\r\nGirifalco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n          DISTRIBUTION OF EARTHQUAKES IN TIME (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seismic energy in relation to geological time._—If we admit that\r\nseismic energy is only a form of volcanic energy, it must also be\r\nadmitted that any cause tending to produce a general decrease in the\r\namount of the latter will also produce an alteration in the amount of\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis of Laplace tells us that the solar system is the\r\nresult of the whirling of a heated gaseous mass, which as it cooled\r\ncontinually contracted and consequently whirls the faster. With this\r\nhypothesis before us, we understand why all the planets and their\r\nsatellites have a similarity in the directions of their movements, why\r\nthey revolve nearly in the same plane, in orbits nearly circular, why\r\nsome have a flattened figure and are surrounded by rings or belts, why\r\nthe exterior planets should have a greater velocity of rotation, a\r\ngreater number of satellites, and a less density as compared with the\r\ninterior planets, the similarity of the elements in meteoric stones,\r\nthe sun, the stars, and those found upon our earth, and lastly why\r\nthere should be an increase in temperature as we descend into our\r\nearth.[92] This increase in temperature as we descend into the earth\r\nas deduced from many observations appears to be about 1° F. for every\r\nfifty or sixty feet of descent.\r\n\r\nTo explain this and other kindred phenomena it is assumed that the\r\nearth was once very much hotter than it is at present, and to reach its\r\npresent stage it has been gradually cooling. As the laws of cooling are\r\nperfectly known, to calculate how many years it must have taken a body\r\nlike our earth to cool down to its present temperature is a definite\r\nproblem. Sir William Thomson, starting with the temperature of 7,000°\r\nF., when all the rocks of the earth must have been molten and a skin or\r\ncrust upon the surface, such as is so quickly produced upon the surface\r\nof molten lava, finds by calculation that the time taken to reach the\r\npresent temperature must have been about one hundred million years.\r\nInto this period he and other physicists desire to compress the history\r\nof all the stratified deposits. Geologists find this period too short.\r\nOthers seeking to reconcile the views of physicists and geologists\r\nendeavour to show that the various agencies engaged in degrading rocks\r\nand accumulating sediments in former ages are not to be judged of by\r\nthe agencies we now see around us; in former times they were more\r\nactive. At one period the elastic tides in the earth may have been so\r\ngreat that they resulted in the fracturing off from our planet its\r\nsatellite the moon, and subsequently the moon, acting on the waters of\r\nthe earth, may, even as late as 150,000 years ago, have produced every\r\nthree hours tides 150 feet in height.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the value of the figures here quoted, reasonings like\r\nthese bring us to the conclusions that the various agencies which we\r\nnow know to be acting upon our earth were once far more potent than\r\nthey are at present, and if the moon, as a producer of elastic tides,\r\nhas any influence upon the occurrence of earthquakes, it must have had\r\na much greater influence in bygone times.\r\n\r\nWe might speak similarly with regard to the internal heat of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the present heat gradient of our globe it is possible to calculate\r\nhow much heat flows from the earth every year.\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to a quantity which would raise a layer of water ·67\r\ncentimetres thick, covering the whole of our globe, from a temperature\r\nof 0° to 100° C.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we might calculate the quantity of heat which would be lost\r\nwhen the average heat gradient, instead of being 1° F. for fifty feet\r\nof descent, was 1° F. for twenty-five feet of descent.\r\n\r\nWe might also calculate how many years ago it was since such a gradient\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nThe general result which we should arrive at would be that in past\r\nages the loss of heat was more rapid than it is at present. Now the\r\ncontraction of a body as it cools is for low temperatures proportional\r\nto its loss of heat, and this law is also probably true for contraction\r\nas it takes place from high temperatures.\r\n\r\nContraction being more rapid, it is probable that phenomena like\r\nelevations and depressions would be more rapid than they are at\r\npresent, and generally all changes due to plutonic action, as has\r\nalready been pointed out by Sir William Thomson, must have been more\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, every reason to imagine that earthquakes which\r\nbelong to the category of phenomena here referred to were also numerous\r\nand occurred on a grander scale during the earlier stages of the\r\nworld’s history than they do at present, and seismic and volcanic\r\nenergy, when considered in reference to long periods of time, is\r\nprobably a decreasing energy.\r\n\r\nIn making this statement we must not overlook the fact that in\r\ngeological time, as testified by the records of our rocks, volcanic\r\naction, and with it probably seismic action, has been continually\r\nshifting, first appearing in one area and then in another, and even\r\nin the same area we have evidence to show that these have periods\r\nof activity and repose successively succeeding each other. Thus in\r\nBritain, during the Palæozoic times, we have many evidences of an\r\nintense volcanic activity. During the Mesozoic or Secondary period\r\nvolcanic energy appears to have subsided, to wake up with renewed\r\nvigour in the Cainozoic or Tertiary period.\r\n\r\nDuring this latter period it is not at all improbable that Scotland\r\nwas in past times as remarkable for its earthquakes as Japan is at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nLater on it will also be shown that earthquakes are concomitant\r\nphenomena, with those elevatory processes which we have reason to\r\nbelieve are slowly going on in certain portions of the earth’s crust.\r\nIf, therefore, we are able by the examination of the rocks which\r\nconstitute the accessible portions of our globe to determine which\r\nperiods were characterised by elevation, we may assume that such\r\nperiods were also periods of seismic activity.\r\n\r\nAmongst these periods we have those in which various mountain ranges\r\nappeared. Thus the Grampians, and the mountains of Scandinavia, were\r\nprobably produced before the deposition of the Old Red sandstone. The\r\nUrals were upheaved prior to Permian times. The chief upheaval in the\r\nAlps took place after Eocene times. The Rigi and other sub-Alpine\r\nmountains were formed after the deposition of the Miocene beds. About\r\nthis same time the Himalayas were upheaved.[93]\r\n\r\nThe earthquakes which from time to time shake those newer mountains\r\napparently indicate that the process of mountain-making is hardly ended.\r\n\r\n_Seismic energy in relation to historical time._—The distribution\r\nof seismic energy with regard to historical time is a subject which\r\nhas been very carefully examined by Mallet, who collected together\r\na catalogue of between six and seven thousand earthquakes, embraced\r\nbetween the periods B.C. 1606 and A.D. 1850. The earthquake of B.C.\r\n1606 was on the occasion of the delivery of the law at Mount Sinai.\r\nBetween B.C. 1604 and B.C. 1586 an earthquake probably occurred in\r\nArabia, when Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up. Another\r\nbiblical record is that of B.C. 1566, when the walls of Jericho were\r\noverthrown.\r\n\r\nThe earliest records from China is in B.C. 595; in Japan B.C. 285; in\r\nIndia A.D. 894.\r\n\r\nBy using the number of earthquakes which have been recorded in each\r\ncentury as ordinates, Mallet constructed a curve, which apparently\r\nshows a continual increase in seismic energy, especially during recent\r\ntimes. This, Mallet remarks, contradicts all the analogies of the\r\nphysics of the globe, and points out that the rapid increase in the\r\nnumber of earthquakes in latter years is chiefly due to the greater\r\nnumber of records which have been made, and the increase of the area\r\nof observation. No doubt many of the records made by the ancients have\r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\nIf we compare Mallet’s records, as he invites us to do, with the\r\ngreat outlines of human progress, we see that the two increase\r\nsimultaneously, and we come to the conclusion that, taken as a whole,\r\nduring the historical period the seismic activity of the world has been\r\ntolerably constant.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions, based on the evidence at our command, are not to\r\nbe confuted. If, however, instead of considering the seismic energy of\r\nthe whole world, we consider the seismic energy of particular areas,\r\nit seems reasonable to expect that in certain instances sometimes a\r\ndecrease and sometimes an increase in this energy might be discovered,\r\nespecially, perhaps, in areas which are highly volcanic.\r\n\r\nIn France we know that volcanic activity ceased at a period closely\r\nbordering on historical times, and it is not unlikely that seismic\r\nactivity may have ceased at a corresponding time.\r\n\r\nIn a country like Japan, it is possible that in one district seismic\r\nenergy may be on the increase, whilst in another upon the decrease.\r\n\r\nIn a country like England, it is probable that the seismic state is\r\nconstant, and, whatever changes may be now occurring, they are taking\r\nplace at so slow a rate that, even if our records of the historical\r\nperiod were complete, we could hardly be expected to find these changes\r\nsufficiently marked to be observable.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of reference, and also for examining the present question,\r\nthe table, page 240, has been compiled. The earthquakes given are\r\nchiefly those which have been recorded in histories as being more or\r\nless destructive.\r\n\r\nIn the second column of this table will be seen the number of\r\nearthquakes which have occurred in Japan during each century, the\r\ncenturies being marked in the first column. In columns 3 to 18\r\ninclusive are given the number of earthquakes which have occurred\r\nduring different centuries in the various countries and districts\r\nmentioned at the head of each column. These latter, which are taken\r\nfrom the writings of Mallet, are given for the sake of comparison with\r\nthe Japanese earthquakes. If we commence with the seventh century in\r\nthe column for Japan, we see that a great increase in the number of\r\nearthquakes, as we come towards the present time, is not so observable\r\nas it is in the other columns.\r\n\r\n Key:\r\n    1 Centuries\r\n    2 Japan\r\n    3 Scandinavia and Iceland\r\n    4 British Isles and Northern Isles\r\n    5 Spanish Peninsula\r\n    6 France, Belgium, Holland\r\n    7 Rhine Basin\r\n    8 Switzerland and Rhine Basin\r\n    9 Danube Basin\r\n   10 Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and Malta\r\n   11 Supplemental table for Italy, Sardinia, and Malta\r\n   12 Turco-Hellenic Territory, Syria, Ægean Isles, and Levant\r\n   13 United States and Canada\r\n   14 Mexico and Central America\r\n   15 Antilles\r\n   16 Cuba\r\n   17 Chili and La Plata Basin\r\n   18 Northern Zone of Asia\r\n   19 Approximate Intensity in the Kioto District of Japan\r\n +------+--+---+---+--+---+--+---+---+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+--+\r\n |   1  |2 | 3 | 4 |5 | 6 |7 | 8 | 9 | 10|11| 12|13|14| 15|16| 17|18|19|\r\n +------+--+---+---+--+---+--+---+---+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+--+\r\n |I.    | 1| --| --|--| --|--| --| --| --|--| --|--|--| --|--| --|--|--|\r\n |II.   |--| --| --|--| --|--| --| --| --|--| --|--|--| --|--| --|--|--|\r\n |III.  | 1| --| --|--| --|--| --| --| --|--| --|--|--| --|--| --|--|--|\r\n |IV.   |--| --| --|--| --|--| --| --|  6|--| 23|--|--| --|--| --|--|--|\r\n |V.    | 1| --| --|--|  1|--| --| --|  5|--| 19|--|--| --|--| --|--|--|\r\n |VI.   | 1| --| --|--|  6|--| --|}  |  3|--| 27|--|--| --|--| --|--|--|\r\n |VII.  |12| --| --|--| --|--| --|}  |  1|--|  8|--|--| --|--| --|--|15|\r\n |VIII. |11| --| --|--| --|--| --|}  |  2| 1| 12|--|--| --|--| --|--|17|\r\n |IX.   |40| --| --|--| 21|--| 19|}  |  6|--|  7|--|--| --|--| --|--|60|\r\n |X.    |17| --| --|--|  2|--|  2|}19|  3| 3|  5|--|--| --|--| --|--|24|\r\n |XI.   |20| --|  8| 3| 16|--|  9|}  |  7| 5| 18|--|--| --|--| --|--|28|\r\n |XII.  |18| --| 11| 4| 12|--|  8|}  | 18|22| 23|--|--| --|--| --|--|20|\r\n |XIII. |16|}  | 15| 3|  9|--|  3|}  | 15|26| 13|--|--| --|--| --|--|16|\r\n |XIV.  |19|}  |  4| 8| 21|--| 18|}  | 20|51|  8|--|--| --|--| --|--|25|\r\n |XV.   |36|}28|  1| 4| 14|--| 12|}  | 18|47| 11|--|--| --|--| --|--|29|\r\n |XVI.  |17|}  |  8|10| 61|10| 52| 35| 32| 5| 22|--| 6|  1| 4|  5|--|17|\r\n |XVII. |26|}  | 14|10| 91|29|120| 31|121| 9| 53|10| 7| 16| 4|  9|--|11|\r\n |XVIII.|31|111| 63|93|237|71|141| 88|438|20|124|88|24| 85| 2| 10|32| 8|\r\n |XIX.  |27|113|110|85|211|81|173|145|390|88|194|51|30|145|50|170|57| 8|\r\n +------+--+---+---+--+---+--+---+---+---+--+---+--+--+---+--+---+--+--+\r\n\r\nThe explanation for this probably lies in the fact that Japan has\r\npractised civilised arts for a longer period than many of the European\r\nand other countries mentioned in the table.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, no doubt, the records of later years have been more perfect\r\nthan they were in early times, but this, although so potent an effacer\r\nof what was probably the true state of natural phenomena in the case of\r\nEurope, has not quite obliterated the truth in Japan; for instead of an\r\napparent increase of seismic energy since early times it shows a slight\r\ndecrease.\r\n\r\nTo draw up a table of earthquakes such as the one which has just been\r\ngiven, and then, after the inspection of it, draw conclusions as to\r\nwhether there has been an increase or decrease in seismic energy, is,\r\nhowever, hardly a just method of reasoning. The earthquakes, taken as\r\nthey are, for the whole of Japan, represent a collection of places some\r\nof which are 1,000 miles apart. When we consider that many earthquakes\r\nwhich occurred at one end of this line were never felt at the other\r\nend, in order to justly estimate the periodicity of seismic phenomena\r\nit would seem that we ought either to take some particular seismic area\r\nor else the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe particular area which has been taken is that of Kioto in Central\r\nJapan, and the earthquakes which have been felt there are enumerated in\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the variation in seismic activity of this district a\r\ncurve has been plotted, fig. 35, with ordinates equal to the values\r\ngiven for the Kioto earthquakes during succeeding centuries. The upper\r\npoints of these ascending and descending lines are joined by a free\r\ncurve. The lower points are similarly joined. The points of bisection\r\nof ordinates drawn between these two curves are taken as points in a\r\ncurve to show the true secular change in seismic energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—Curve of Seismic Intensity for Kioto.]\r\n\r\nBy looking at this wavy line it will be seen that the intervals between\r\nmaxima and minima are closer together in early times than they are\r\nlater on.\r\n\r\nThus, between the eighth century and the ninth century, points of\r\nmaximum and minimum seismic efforts occurred at times a century apart,\r\nwhilst later on, from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, they were\r\nat intervals of 300 years apart.\r\n\r\nBy inspecting either the wavy line or the resultant curve, it will be\r\nseen that since the ninth century down to the present time there has\r\nbeen a decided decrease in seismic energy. From the ninth century down\r\nto the fifteenth century this decrease is represented by a regular\r\ncurve. At this point, however, the decrease becomes slightly more\r\nrapid, and is represented by a second curve. If, instead of calculating\r\nordinates for my curve, in which intensity has been considered, simply\r\nthe number of earthquakes are counted, a similar result is obtained.\r\nFrom this it appears that the rate at which seismic energy decreased\r\nduring the last 500 years was about the same as that at which it\r\ndecreased during the 500 years previous to this period.\r\n\r\nIf the lists for the Italian and Turco-Hellenic districts could be\r\nsimilarly analysed, and the earthquakes of any particular district\r\npicked out from the others, it is very probable that a similar decrease\r\nor alteration in seismic energy might be observed.\r\n\r\nProvided that we have at our disposal records of the various\r\nearthquakes which have occurred in any given district during a\r\nsufficiently long period of time, one conclusion that we may expect\r\nto arrive at is that we shall be able to trace some variation in\r\nthe seismic activity of that district. For the Kioto area, it has\r\nbeen shown that there is a diminution in seismic activity, In other\r\ndistricts, however, there may possibly be an increase.[94]\r\n\r\n_Relative frequency of earthquakes._—A question which is of great\r\ninterest to those who dwell in shaken districts is as to how often\r\ndisturbances may be expected to occur.\r\n\r\nFrom a general examination of this question, considering the\r\nearthquakes of the whole world. Mallet arrived at the following\r\nconclusions:—\r\n\r\n1. While the smallest or minimum paroxysmal intervals may be a year\r\nor two, the average interval is from five to ten years of comparative\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\n2. The shorter intervals are in connection with periods of fewer\r\nearthquakes—not always with those of least intensity, but usually so.\r\n\r\n3. The alternations of paroxysm and of repose appear to follow no\r\nabsolute law deducible from these curves.\r\n\r\n4. Two marked periods of extreme paroxysm are observable in each\r\ncentury, one greater than the other—that of greatest number and\r\nintensity occurring about the middle of each century, the other towards\r\nthe end of each.\r\n\r\nThe form of the curves which Mallet has drawn seem to indicate that\r\nseismic energy came in sudden bursts, and then subsided, gradually\r\ngathering strength for another exhibition. This is continually seen\r\nin the shocks experienced in various seismic areas—a large shock, or\r\nthe maximum of the activity dying out by repeated small shocks on\r\nsucceeding days.\r\n\r\nMr. I. Hattori, writing on the large earthquakes of Japan, remarks that\r\non the average there has been one large earthquake every ten years.\r\nThey, however, occur in groups, as shown in the following table.\r\n\r\n +------+---------------+----------+\r\n |No. of|               |          |\r\n |shocks|    Period     | Interval |\r\n +------+---------------+----------+\r\n |  6   | A.D. 827–836  | 10 years |\r\n |  6   |  „   880–890  | 10   „   |\r\n |  4   |  „  1040–1043 |  4   „   |\r\n |  5   |  „  1493–1507 |  5   „   |\r\n |  4   |  „  1510–1513 |  4   „   |\r\n |  5   |  „  1645–1650 |  6   „   |\r\n |  5   |  „  1662–1664 |  3   „   |\r\n |  4   |  „  1853–1856 |  4   „   |\r\n +------+---------------+----------+\r\n\r\nDr. E. Naumann, who has also written on the earthquakes in Japan,\r\nremarks that if periods of seismic activity do not occur every 490\r\nyears, there is a repetition of the cycle after 980 years, but there\r\nis much variability. A period of 68 years is very marked. On the\r\naverage, large earthquakes have occurred every 5·9 years. Fuchs\r\ngives some interesting examples of the repetition of earthquakes at\r\ndefinite intervals, of which the following are examples. Sometimes\r\nearthquakes appear to have repeated themselves after 100 years. One\r\nremarkable example of this is that of Lima, on June 17, 1578, which was\r\nrepeated on the same day in the year 1678. In Copiapo it is believed\r\nthat earthquakes occur every twenty-three years, and examples of such\r\nrepetitions are found in the years 1773, 1796, and 1819. In Canada,\r\nnear to Quebec, earthquakes lasting forty days are said to occur every\r\ntwenty-five years. The plateau of Ardebil is said to be regularly\r\nshaken by earthquakes every two years.\r\n\r\nA. Caldcleugh, writing on the earthquake of Chili, in 1835,[95] remarks\r\nthat the Spaniards first had the idea that a great earthquake occurs\r\nevery century. Afterwards they thought the period was every fifty\r\nyears. As a matter of fact, however, there were large earthquakes in\r\n1812, at Caracas; in 1818, at Copiapo; in 1822, at Santiago; in 1827,\r\nat Bogota; in 1828, at Lima; in 1829, at Santiago; and in 1832, at\r\nHuasco.\r\n\r\nThe average period of seismic disturbances in any country probably\r\ndepends upon the subterranean volcanic activity of that country.\r\nWhen the activity is great the large earthquakes may occur at short\r\nintervals; but when the activity is small, as in England, shocks of\r\nmoderate intensity may not be felt more than once or twice per century.\r\nA general idea of the relative frequency of the large earthquakes in\r\nvarious parts of the world may be easily obtained by an inspection of\r\nthe table on page 240.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1850 and 1857 Kluge found that in the world there had\r\nbeen 4,620 earthquakes, which is, upon the average, nearly two per day.\r\nThis estimate of the frequency of earthquakes of sufficient intensity\r\nto be recorded without the aid of instruments is, however, much below\r\nthe truth. In Japan alone there probably occurs, as a daily average, a\r\nnumber at least equal to that which has been just given for the whole\r\nworld. Boussingault considered that, in the Andes, earthquakes were\r\noccurring every instant of time.[96]\r\n\r\nTo state definitely how many earthquakes are felt in the world on the\r\naverage every day is, from the data which we have at our command, an\r\nimpossibility. Perhaps there may be ten, perhaps there may be 100. The\r\nquestion is one which remains to be decided by statistics which have\r\nyet to be compiled.\r\n\r\nAfter a large earthquake, smaller shocks usually occur at short\r\nintervals. At first the succession of disturbances are separated from\r\neach other by perhaps only a few minutes or hours. Later on, the\r\nintensity of these shocks usually decreases, and the intervals between\r\nthem become greater and greater, until, finally, after perhaps a few\r\nmonths, the seismic activity of the area assumes a quiescent state.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquake which overtook Concepcion on February 20, 1835,\r\nwas followed by a succession of shocks like those just referred to,\r\nthere being registered, between the date of the destructive shock and\r\nMarch 4, 300 smaller disturbances.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-four hours succeeding the destruction of Lima\r\n(October 28, 1746), 200 shocks were counted, and up to the 24th of\r\nFebruary in the following year 451 shocks were felt.\r\n\r\nAt St. Thomas, in 1868, 283 shocks were counted in nine and a quarter\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nSimilar examples might be taken from the description of almost\r\nall destructive earthquakes of which we have records. For a large\r\nearthquake to occur, and not to be accompanied by a train of succeeding\r\nearthquakes, is exceptional. Sometimes we find that a large number of\r\nsmall earthquakes have occurred without a large one being felt. Seismic\r\nstorms of this description have happened, even in England—for instance,\r\nin the year 1750, which appears to have been a year of earthquakes for\r\nmany portions of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn this year, which is known as the ‘earthquake year,’ shocks were felt\r\nin England as follows: On March 14, in Surrey; March 18, in south-west\r\nof England; April 2, at Chester; June 7, at Norwich; August 23, in\r\nLincolnshire; September 30, Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n_Synchronism of earthquakes._—One of the first writers who drew\r\nattention to the fact that two shocks of earthquakes have been felt\r\nsimultaneously at distant places was David Milne, who published a list\r\nof these occurrences.[97]\r\n\r\nIn two instances, February and March 1750, shocks were simultaneously\r\nfelt in England and Italy. In September 1833 shocks appear to have been\r\nsimultaneously felt in England and Peru. These and many other similar\r\nexamples are discussed by Mallet, who thinks with Milne that these\r\ncoincidences are in every probability matters of accident. According to\r\nFuchs, Calabria and Sicily appear often to have had earthquakes at the\r\nsame time, as for instance in 1169, 1535, 1638, when the town Euphemia\r\nsank, and in the years 1770, 1776, 1780, and 1783.\r\n\r\nA remarkable example of coincidence occurred on November 16, 1827, when\r\na terrible earthquake was felt in Columbia, and at the same time a\r\nshock occurred on the Ochotsk plains, nearly antipodal to each other.\r\n\r\nKluge also gives a large number of instances of simultaneous\r\nearthquakes; thus, on January 23, 1855, on the same day that\r\nWellington, New Zealand, so severely suffered, there was a heavy\r\nearthquake in the Siebengeberge, and also in North America. To this\r\nmight be added the fact that the last destructive earthquake in Japan\r\noccurred within a few days of this time.\r\n\r\nSometimes neighbouring countries where earthquakes are common are\r\nequally remarkable by their utter want of synchronism. For example,\r\nSouthern Italy and Syria are said never to be shaken simultaneously.\r\n\r\n_Secondary earthquakes._—Although it is possible that the simultaneous\r\noccurrence of earthquakes in distant regions may sometimes be a\r\nmatter of chance, it must also be remarked that the shaking produced\r\nby one earthquake may be sufficient to cause ground which is in a\r\ncritical state to give way, and thus the first disturbance becomes the\r\noriginator of a second earthquake. Admitting that an earthquake, as\r\nit radiates from its centre, may act in such a manner, we see that a\r\nfeeble disturbance might be the ultimate cause in the production of a\r\ndestructive earthquake, just as the disturbance of a stone upon the\r\nface of a scarp might, by its impact upon other stones, cause many tons\r\nof material to be dislodged.\r\n\r\nIt is also easy to conceive how the seismic activity of two districts\r\nmay be dependent upon each other. Inasmuch as these secondary shocks\r\nare direct effects of primary disturbances, they might have been\r\ntreated in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nAs examples of consequent or secondary earthquakes Fuchs tells us that\r\nwhen small earthquakes take place in Constantinople and Asia Minor,\r\nearthquakes are felt in Bukharest, Galazy, and Kronstadt.\r\n\r\nThe great Lisbon earthquake also appears to have given rise to several\r\nconsequent disturbances. One was in Derbyshire, occurring at 11 a.m.\r\nIt was sufficiently violent to cause plaster to fall from the sides\r\nof a room and a chasm to open on the surface of the ground. Some\r\nminers working underground were so alarmed that they endeavoured to\r\nescape to the surface. During twenty minutes there were three distinct\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nAnother shock was felt at Cork.[98]\r\n\r\nAlthough these disturbances own a consequence of the Lisbon earthquake\r\nthey might properly perhaps be attributed to the pulsations produced by\r\nthe shock at Lisbon, which spread through England and other countries\r\nwithout being felt.\r\n\r\nThe shocks which men felt in New Zealand and New South Wales in 1868\r\nwere probably secondary shocks, due to the disturbance at Arequipa and\r\nother places on the South American coast.\r\n\r\nThese so-called secondary earthquakes, although in many instances\r\nthey may be due to earth pulsations produced by earthquake, or to the\r\nimmediate sensible shaking of a large earthquake, may perhaps, in\r\ncertain instances, be attributed to some widespread disturbance beneath\r\nthe crust of the earth. The occurrence of periods where all earthquake\r\ncountries suffer, unusual disturbances indicate the probability of such\r\nunderground phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n          DISTRIBUTION OF EARTHQUAKES IN TIME (_continued_).\r\n\r\n  The occurrence of earthquakes in relation to the position of the\r\n    heavenly bodies—Earthquakes and the moon—Earthquakes and the sun;\r\n    and the seasons; the months—Planets and meteors—Hours at which\r\n    earthquakes are frequent—Earthquakes and sun spots—Earthquakes\r\n    and the aurora.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The position of the heavenly bodies and the occurrence of\r\nearthquakes._—Since the earliest times, in searching for the cause of\r\nvarious natural phenomena, man has turned his energies towards the\r\nheavens. One of the earliest observations was the connection that\r\nexists between the season of the year and the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies. Tides were seen to be influenced by the moon. In later times\r\nit has been discovered that periods of maximum magnetic disturbances\r\noccur every ten or eleven years with the sun spots, and Herr Kreil, of\r\nVienna, tells us our satellite, the moon, has also an influence upon\r\nthe magnet.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day we see the bond connecting our planet with the sun, the\r\nmoon, and other heavenly bodies which are outside us gradually becoming\r\ncloser.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as many phenomena, like the motion of the tides, the rise and\r\nfall of the barometer, fluctuations in temperature, are all more or\r\nless directly connected with the relative position of our planet with\r\nregard to the sun and moon, any coincidence between the phases of\r\nthese bodies and the occurrence of earthquakes more or less involves a\r\ntime relationship with the other phenomena resultant on lunar and solar\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes and the position of the moon._—Many earthquake\r\ninvestigators have attempted to show the connection between earthquakes\r\nand the phases of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe first and most successful worker in this branch of seismology was\r\nProfessor Alexis Perrey, of Dijon, who, after many years of arduous\r\nlabour in tabulating and examining catalogues of earthquakes, showed\r\nthat earthquakes were more likely to occur at the following periods\r\nthan at others.\r\n\r\n1. They are more frequent at new or full moon (syzygies) than at half\r\nmoon (quadratures).\r\n\r\n2. They are more frequent when the moon is nearest the earth (perigee)\r\nthan when she is farthest off (apogee).\r\n\r\n3. They are more frequent when the moon is on the meridian than when\r\nshe is on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThese results were obtained by Perrey after analysing his catalogues\r\nby three different and independent methods, and they were confirmed\r\nby the report of a committee appointed by the Academy of Sciences. It\r\nmust, however, be remarked that in several instances anomalies occur,\r\nand also that the difference between the number of earthquakes at any\r\ntwo periods is not a very large one. Thus, for instance, the annual\r\ncatalogues compiled by Perrey from 1844 to 1847, the earthquakes in\r\nperigee are to those in apogee as 47 : 39. Between the years 1843 and\r\n1872 Perrey finds that 3,290 shocks occurred at the moon’s perigee, and\r\n3,015 at the apogee.[99]\r\n\r\nBetween 1761 and 1800 earthquakes occurred as follows:—\r\n\r\n  In Perigee       526\r\n  Apogee           465\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the results which enabled Perrey to deduce\r\nhis first law.\r\n\r\nDividing the period of lunation into quarters, with the time of\r\nsyzygies and quadratures as the centres of these quarters, he found\r\nthat the earthquakes were distributed as follows.\r\n\r\n +-----------+--------+----------+-------------+---------------+\r\n |           |        |          |             | Difference in |\r\n |           | Totals | Syzygies | Quadratures | favour of the |\r\n |           |        |          |             |   Syzygies    |\r\n +-----------+--------+----------+-------------+---------------+\r\n | 1843–1847 |  1,604 |   850·48 |    753·52   |     69·96     |\r\n | 1848–1852 |  2,049 | 1,053·53 |    995·47   |     58·06     |\r\n | 1853–1857 |  3,018 | 1,534·13 |  1,483·87   |     50·26     |\r\n | 1858–1862 |  3,140 | 1,602·99 |  1,537·41   |     65·98     |\r\n | 1863–1867 |  2,845 | 1,463·42 |  1,381·58   |     81·84     |\r\n | 1868–1872 |  4,593 | 2,333·48 |  2,259·52   |     73·96     |\r\n | 1843–1872 | 17,249 | 8,838·03 |  8,410·97   |    427·06     |\r\n +-----------+--------+----------+-------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nThe reported earthquakes between 1751 and 1843 are shown to conform\r\nwith the same rule.[100] Julius Schmidt, astronomer at Athens, found\r\nfor the earthquakes of Eastern Europe and adjacent countries for the\r\nyears 1776 to 1873 that there were more earthquakes when the moon was\r\nin perigee. Other maxima were at new moon, and two days after the first\r\nquarter. There was a diminution at full moon, and a minimum on the day\r\nof the last quarter. As one example of results which are antagonistic\r\nto the general results obtained by Perrey may be quoted the results of\r\nan examination by Professor W. S. Chaplin of the earthquake recorded at\r\nthe meteorological observatory in Tokio. The list of earthquakes, 143\r\nin number, extending over a period of three years, was recorded by one\r\nof Palmieri’s instruments. The results were as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. There have been maxima of earthquakes when the moon was two and\r\nnine hours east and seven hours west. At the upper transit there is a\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n2. Considering the moon’s position with regard to the sun, at\r\nconjunction there were 32, at opposition 37, and at quadrature 74. East\r\nof the meridian the maximum was at least four hours.\r\n\r\n3. When the moon was north of the equator these were 68, when south 82.\r\n\r\n4. A maximum of earthquakes seven and eleven days after the moon’s\r\nperigee. The fact that these results were obtained for the earthquakes\r\nof a special small seismic area renders them more interesting.[101]\r\n\r\n_Frequency of earthquakes in relation to the position of the sun._—The\r\nquestion as to whether there is a connection between the frequency of\r\nearthquakes and the relative position of the sun is to a great extent\r\nidentical with the question as to the relative frequency of earthquakes\r\nin the various seasons. It is a subject which we find referred to\r\nby writers in the earliest ages. Pliny and Aristotle thought that\r\nearthquakes occurred chiefly in spring and autumn. In later times it\r\nhas been a subject which has been most carefully considered by Merian,\r\nvon Hoff, Perrey, Mallet, Volger, Kluge, and others who have devoted\r\nattention to seismology. In a résumé of the earthquakes of Europe, and\r\nof the adjacent parts of Asia and Africa, from A.D. 306–1843, Mallet\r\ngives the following results:—\r\n\r\n +------------------+------------------------+----------------------+\r\n |                  | For Nineteenth Century | For the whole period |\r\n +------------------+------------------------+----------------------+\r\n | Winter Solstice  |   177 } Solstices      | 253 }  Solstices     |\r\n | Spring Equinox   |   151 } }  306         | 170 } }  403         |\r\n | Summer Solstice  |   129 } } Equinoxes    | 150 } } Equinoxes    |\r\n | Autumnal Equinox |   164   }   315        | 159   }   329        |\r\n +------------------+------------------------+----------------------|\r\n\r\nThe above periods were called by Perrey _critical epochs_, because\r\nas a general result of his researches he found that at such periods\r\nthere was a greater frequency of earthquakes. Fuchs, quoting from\r\nKluge’s tables, extending from 1850–1857, tells us that the recorded\r\nearthquakes occurred as follows:—\r\n\r\n  In the Northern Hemisphere—\r\n      Equinoxes                =1324=\r\n      Solstices                 1202\r\n  In the Southern Hemisphere—\r\n      Equinoxes                 =301=\r\n      Solstices                  261\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are, therefore, more frequent at the equinoxes, and this\r\nespecially at the autumnal equinox. In the northern hemisphere, at\r\nthe solstices, the greater number of shocks occur about the winter\r\nsolstices, whilst in the southern hemisphere, about the summer\r\nsolstices.\r\n\r\nExceptions, however, are found in Central America and the West Indies,\r\nin the Caucasus, and the Ægean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe idea that earthquakes had a periodicity dependent upon the position\r\nof the heavenly bodies is by no means confined to Europe. In a Japanese\r\nwork called ‘Jishin Setsu’ (an opinion about earthquakes) by a priest\r\ncalled Tensho, it is stated that the relative positions and movements\r\nof the twenty-eight constellations with respect to the moon cause\r\nearthquakes. This Tensho asserts after careful calculation, and Falb\r\ntells us that all future earthquakes can be predicted.\r\n\r\nIn the Kuriles and Kamschatka, Sicily, and in parts of South America,\r\nit is said that the equinoxes are regarded as dangerous seasons.\r\n\r\n_Frequency of earthquakes in relation to the seasons and months._—What\r\nis here said respecting the relative frequency of earthquakes at the\r\ndifferent seasons and months is little more than an extension and\r\ncritical examination of the results which have been given respecting\r\nthe frequency of earthquakes in regard to the position of the sun.\r\n\r\nThat there is a difference between the number of earthquakes which are\r\nfelt at one season of the year as compared with those felt at another\r\nis a fact which, as seismoscopic observations are extended, is becoming\r\nmore and more recognised.\r\n\r\nSome of the more important results which were arrived at by Mallet from\r\n5,879 observations made in the northern hemisphere, and 223 in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, may be expressed as follows:—\r\n\r\n +---------------------+------------------------+-------------------+\r\n |                     |        Maxima          |       Minima      |\r\n +---------------------+------------------------+-------------------+\r\n | Northern Hemisphere | January, also a slight | May, June, and    |\r\n |                     |   rise in August and   |   July            |\r\n |                     |   October              |                   |\r\n | Southern Hemisphere | November, also May     | March, extending  |\r\n |                     |   and June             |   over one month, |\r\n |                     |                        |   also August     |\r\n +---------------------+------------------------+-------------------+\r\n\r\nJulius Schmidt, of Athens, who so carefully examined the earthquakes of\r\neastern Europe, came to the following conclusions:—\r\n\r\nFor the earthquakes between 1200 and 1873, a maximum on September 26\r\nand January 17; a minimum on December 3 and June 13.\r\n\r\nFor the earthquakes between 1873 and 1874, a maximum on March 1 and\r\nOctober 1; a minimum on July 7 and December 15.\r\n\r\nFor all the earthquakes of eastern Europe, a maximum on January 3; a\r\nminimum on July 8, or there was a maximum at perihelion and aphelion.\r\n\r\nWhen the months are grouped together according to the seasons, spring,\r\nsummer, autumn, and winter, we find that in the northern hemisphere the\r\nminimum is in summer and the maximum in winter, whilst in the southern\r\nhemisphere (giving the proper months corresponding to its seasons) we\r\nfind two maxima, one at the commencement of winter, and the other at\r\nmidsummer, whilst the minima are in spring and autumn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—Curves of Monthly Seismic Intensity (Mallet).]\r\n\r\nIn the following table the difference in the number of earthquakes felt\r\nat different seasons is given more in detail.\r\n\r\nIn examining this table, we must remember that for countries like Peru,\r\nChili, and New Zealand, lying in the southern hemisphere, the records\r\ngiven for the months April to September correspond to the winter months\r\nof those countries. The Roman numerals indicate the centuries between\r\nwhich the records date.\r\n\r\n +----------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+\r\n |          |                                        |October|  April  |\r\n |          |                                        |  to   |   to    |\r\n |          |                                        | March |September|\r\n +----------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+\r\n |         {| 1.

In the northern regions, out of fourteen examples there are\r\ntwo exceptions. In the central regions there are two cases where the\r\ngreatest number of earthquakes have been recorded in the winter months,\r\nand two cases where the greatest number have been recorded for the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nAltogether, out of twenty-two examples, there are only six exceptions\r\nto the rule. These exceptions altogether occur among records many of\r\nwhich are ancient, and are, therefore, more open to error than lists\r\nwhich have been compiled in modern times.\r\n\r\nBecause small earthquakes are seldom noticed by persons out in the\r\nopen air, it might be expected that the number of earthquakes observed\r\nin warm countries at one portion of the year would be equal to those\r\nobserved in any other season. Such an argument, however, would hardly\r\napply to most of the records which are quoted, as they refer to\r\ndestructive disturbances.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we take the records made in tropical countries from the\r\ntable just given, we see that in such countries there have been almost\r\nas many observations of earthquakes at one season as at any other.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which might be adduced against the rule that the\r\ngreater number of earthquakes occur during the winter months would\r\nbe the comparison of a table of earthquakes recorded previous to the\r\nnineteenth century. By doing this we see that for certain countries the\r\nwinter rule is inverted, and that the greater number of shocks are felt\r\nduring the summer.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these objections to Perrey’s conclusions, the balance\r\nof evidence is in favour of his general result, and we may conclude\r\nthat during the colder portions of the year we may expect more shakings\r\nthan during the warmer portions. Comparing the number of earthquakes of\r\nwinter and autumn to those of summer and spring, they are to each other\r\nin the proportion of 4 : 3.\r\n\r\nA fairer way to examine this question, and to determine what is\r\nprobably the present state of seismic activity in our globe, would\r\nbe only to consider the earthquakes which have taken place in\r\ncomparatively recent times, laying especial stress upon those\r\nobservations which have been made with the assistance of automatic\r\ninstruments, or those which have been collected by persons interested\r\nin these investigations.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the following table, showing the distribution of\r\nearthquakes in different countries during the nineteenth century, has\r\nbeen compiled.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement is mensual. Where the number of earthquakes in any\r\nmonth is above the average, the number is printed in large type; where\r\nbelow the average, in small type.\r\n\r\n\r\n      EARTHQUAKES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, CHIEFLY FROM PERREY.\r\n\r\n Key:\r\n   Jan January\r\n   Feb February\r\n   Mar March\r\n   Apr April\r\n   May May\r\n   Jun June\r\n   Jul July\r\n   Aug August\r\n   Sep September\r\n   Oct October\r\n   Nov November\r\n   Dec December\r\n   Ave Average per month\r\n +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n |                         |Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec|Ave |\r\n |-------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----|\r\n |Scandinavia and Iceland  | 17| 11| 11|  7|  7|  6|  8|  8| 10| 10| 11|  6| 9·3|\r\n |British Isles and        |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  Northern Isles         |  9|  9| 10|  7|  8|  6|  5| 11| 12|  8| 11| 12| 9  |\r\n |France, Belgium, Holland | 27| 17| 21| 13| 13|  8| 15| 17| 15| 17| 21| 25|17  |\r\n |Basin of the Rhone       | 12| 12|  8|  3|  3|  2|  2|  4|  6|  6|  8| 14| 6·6|\r\n |Basin of the Rhine and   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  Switzerland            | 15| 17| 13| 12| 11|  6| 12| 11| 10| 17| 24| 25|14  |\r\n |Basin of the Danube      | 14| 15|  9|  8| 12|  8| 16| 11| 11| 16| 10| 12|11·8|\r\n |Spanish Peninsula        | 10|  5|  6|  7|  4|  6| 10|  5|  9| 11|  7|  5| 7  |\r\n |Italian Peninsula,       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  Sicily, Sardinia,      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  and Malta              | 44| 44| 48| 43| 40| 34| 41| 46| 27| 45| 26| 39|39  |\r\n |Turco-Hellenic Territory,|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  Syria, Ægean Islands,  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  and Levant             | 22| 20| 10| 10| 16| 15| 14| 22| 14| 17| 12| 14|16  |\r\n |Northern Zone of Asia    |  4|  6|  6|  4|  4|  3|  5|  7|  6|  3|  4|  5| 4·7|\r\n |1876–1881, Japan (Tokio  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  area)                  | 39| 41| 41| 30| 33| 30| 27| 21| 10| 28| 34| 43|31·4|\r\n |Japan (large earthquakes)| --|  5|  3|  3|  1| --|  5|  4| --| --|  1|  5| 2  |\r\n |Algeria and North’rn     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  Africa                 |  5|  2|  6|  7|  3|  2|  2|  5|  1|  4|  8|  1| 3·8|\r\n |United States and Canada |  4|  4|  3|  3|  3| --|  4|  6|  3|  2|  7|  5| 3·8|\r\n |Java, Sumatra, &c.,      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  1873–4–5–7 and 9       | 35| 30| 38| 33| 22| 36| 27| 40| 24| 35| 30| 26|31  |\r\n |Mexico and Central       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  America                |  3|  2|  2|  2|  6|  2|  2|  1|  1|  3|  2|  3| 2·5|\r\n |Antilles                 |  9|  8| 19| 12| 12| 10|  9| 16| 12| 10| 13| 12|11·8|\r\n |Cuba                     |  4|  3|  2|  3|  3|  4|  5|  2|  6|  5|  6|  4| 4  |\r\n |Chili and La Plata       | 14| 10| 14|  8| 19| 11| 16| 15| 16|  9| 27|  8|13·9|\r\n |Peru, Columbia, Basins   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |  of Amazons, xvi–xix    | 92| 83| 92| 27|106| 79| 94| 93| 97| 77| 72| 90|87  |\r\n |New Zealand, 1869–79     | 31| 27| 37| 23| 22| 31| 27| 36| 37| 21| 27| 23|28·5|\r\n |    Jan. 1850, Dec. 1857 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |Northern Hemisphere      |153|162|143|161|126|124|141|156|154|171|151|168|150 |\r\n |Southern Hemisphere      | 75| 43| 61| 66| 46| 42| 53| 39| 54| 55| 57| 46|53  |\r\n |      1821–1830          |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |    |\r\n |Northern Hemisphere      | 31| 36| 31| 29| 33| 33| 20| 31| 24| 41| 26| 34|30  |\r\n |Southern Hemisphere      |  2| --|  1|  1|  3|  1|  3|  2|  3|  2|  1|  1| 1·6|\r\n +-------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+----+\r\n\r\nA glance at this table shows that for most countries in the northern\r\nhemisphere the rule that there are generally more earthquakes during\r\nthe winter months—that is, from October to March—holds good. For\r\ncountries which lie comparatively near to the Equator, and also for\r\nthose countries in the southern hemisphere, the rule is not so clear.\r\nWhen examining this table it must be remembered that it does not enable\r\nus to judge of the relative frequency of earthquakes in different\r\ncountries, inasmuch as the periods over which the records were taken\r\nare different in different cases.\r\n\r\nTo the above table might be added the records of P. Merian, who\r\nexamined the earthquakes felt in Basle up to 1831. As a result he\r\nfound that during the winter months eighty shocks had been felt,\r\nwhilst during the summer only forty. Taking the records for the two\r\nhemispheres from 1850–1857, compiled by Kluge,[102] in the northern\r\nhemisphere we have in the months between October and March 948 shocks\r\nagainst 862 in the remainder of the year. In the same months in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere we have for the corresponding periods the numbers\r\n337 and 300, and thus both hemispheres would appear to follow the same\r\nrule. If, however, we examine the table we see that the two seasons\r\nare not so pronounced for the southern hemisphere as they are for\r\nthe northern, and that there may be two or three periods of maximum\r\ndisturbance as has been previously indicated.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes and the planets and meteors._—Just as the moon and the sun\r\nmay exert an attractive influence upon the earth and cause earthquakes\r\nto predominate at certain seasons rather than at others, several\r\ninvestigators of seismic phenomena have thought that the planets might\r\nact in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nM. J. Delauney, from a study of Perrey’s tables of earthquakes from\r\n1750–1842, found two groups of maxima each with a period of about\r\ntwelve years, one commencing in 1759 and the other in 1756. Two\r\nother groups with twenty-eight year periods respectively commence in\r\n1756 and 1773. These groups coincide with the times when Jupiter and\r\nSaturn reach the mean longitudes of 265° and 135°. From this Delauney\r\nconcludes that earthquakes have a maximum when the planets are in the\r\nmean longitudes just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe increased number of earthquakes, especially in November, are\r\nattributed to the passage of the earth through swarms of meteors, and\r\nin like manner supposes the influence of Jupiter and Saturn to be due\r\nto their passing through meteor streams situated in mean longitudes\r\n135° and 265°.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this he predicts an increase of earthquakes in the\r\nyears 1886, 1891, 1898, 1900, &c.[103]\r\n\r\nDr. E. Naumann, who critically examined the large earthquakes of Japan,\r\nshowed that there was an approximate coincidence between many of the\r\ndisturbances and the thirty-three year period of meteoric showers.[104]\r\n\r\nHumboldt states that a great shower of meteors was seen at Quito before\r\nthe great earthquake of Riobamba (Feb. 4, 1797). The earthquakes of\r\n1766 and 1799 at Cumana are also said to have been accompanied with\r\nmeteoric showers. Mallet gives a list of large earthquakes which\r\noccurred at the times when meteors were observed.[105]\r\n\r\n_The hours at which earthquakes are most frequent._—From the\r\nexamination of a catalogue of over 2,000 earthquakes which occurred in\r\nvarious parts of the world between the years 1850 and 1857, made by\r\nKluge, it is found that both for the northern and southern hemispheres\r\nthe observations which were made during the night generally exceed\r\nthose which were made during the day.\r\n\r\n +---------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n |                           | Number of Earthquakes |\r\n +---------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n |                           |   Day   |    Night    |\r\n |In the Northern Hemisphere |   938   |    1592     |\r\n |In the Southern Hemisphere |   292   |     357     |\r\n +---------------------------+---------+-------------+\r\n\r\nIn the northern hemisphere the greatest number were observed between\r\n10 P.M. and 12 P.M. (360 shocks), and the fewest between 12 and 2 P.M.\r\n(139 shocks). In the southern hemisphere, the greatest number were\r\nobserved at night between 12 and 1, and the smallest number between 1\r\nand 2 and 4 and 5 in the afternoon.[106] These distinctions, however,\r\nare less distinctly marked as we approach the Equator. Schmidt found\r\nfor the earthquakes of the Orient between 1774 and 1873, that shocks\r\nhad been most frequent about half-past two A.M., and less frequent\r\nabout 1 P.M. With regard to these conclusions, which have been reached\r\nwith much labour, we might be inclined to think that they are partially\r\nto be explained on the supposition that more observations are made\r\nduring the night than during the day—the personal experience of\r\nresidents in an earthquake country being, that many earthquakes which\r\noccur during the day are passed by unnoticed, whilst those which occur\r\nduring the night are recorded by thousands of observers. Such a view is\r\ncertainly confirmed by the instrumental records obtained in Japan. From\r\n1872 to 1880 inclusive there were 261 shocks recorded, 132 of which\r\noccurred between the hours of 6 P.M. and 6 A.M.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes and sun spots._—Of late years considerable attention\r\nhas been drawn to a coincidence between the occurrence of sun spots,\r\nmagnetic disturbances, rainfall, and other natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nThese periods of sun spots occur about every eleven years, and appear\r\nto be coincident with the periodical return of the planet Jupiter. In\r\nJapan, Dr. E. Naumann sought for a coincidence between these periods of\r\nsun spots and earthquakes, but without any marked results.\r\n\r\nSchmidt, who carefully compared his lists of earthquakes with the\r\nappearance of sun spots, came to the conclusion that there was no\r\nmarked coincidence. The occurrence of earthquakes had sometimes\r\nsynchronised with sun spots, whilst at other times there had been a\r\nmaximum of sun spots and no earthquakes.\r\n\r\nM. R. Wolf[107] apparently considers that earthquakes, like volcanic\r\neruptions and the appearance of the aurora, are coincident with sun\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nKluge, however, came to the conclusion that when there are few sun\r\nspots, earthquakes, like volcanic eruptions and magnetic disturbances,\r\nhave been at a maximum.\r\n\r\nM. A. Poey, who examined a catalogue of the earthquakes of Mexico\r\nand the Antilles, extending from 1634 to 1870, shows by a table that\r\nearthquakes have come in groups, first at the maxima and then at the\r\nminima period of sun spots. Out of thirty-eight groups, seventeen\r\nbeing at the maximum and seventeen at the minimum, the remaining four\r\nare exceptions to the rule, being between the maximum and minimum.\r\nPhenomena which are dependent upon heat occur with the minima of sun\r\nspots, and those dependent upon cold with the maxima.[108]\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes and the aurora._—The possible connection between\r\nearthquakes and the aurora is a subject which has attracted some\r\nattention. Boué has especially made a careful examination of this\r\nsubject.[109]\r\n\r\nHe comes to the conclusion that if we compare the monthly periods of\r\nearthquake frequency and the aurora there is an agreement between\r\nthe two. Comparing Perrey’s tables of earthquakes from the fourth to\r\nthe nineteenth century, with tables of the aurora, one-third of both\r\nphenomena have occurred, not only in the same day, but often at the\r\nsame hour. Between 1834 and 1847, 457 earthquakes are given and 351\r\nnotices of the aurora.\r\n\r\nOut of these:—\r\n    48 occur on the same day,\r\n     5 occur in the same hour,\r\n    30 approximate to the same time.\r\n\r\nThe nearer together that these phenomena have occurred the stronger\r\nhave they been.\r\n\r\nProfessor M. S. di Rossi brings forward many examples where there\r\nhas been a coincidence between the appearance of the aurora and\r\nearthquakes. On 139 nights out of 211 days the aurora was seen in\r\nsome parts of Italy, and ninety-three times earthquakes were felt. On\r\nforty-six occasions earthquakes and aurora took place together.[110] In\r\nconsidering the probability of a connection existing between these two\r\nphenomena, we must bear in mind that the aurora is at no great height\r\nabove the surface of our earth, and, further, that it can be partially\r\nimitated. The fact that in earthquake countries, like Japan, the aurora\r\nis practically never seen, would indicate that we can neither regard\r\nthis imperfectly understood phenomenon either as an effect or cause\r\nof earthquakes. That earthquakes and the appearance of the aurora in\r\ncertain countries should not sometimes coincide is an impossibility.\r\n\r\nDr. Stukeley, who, it must be remembered, attempted to correlate\r\nthe phenomena of earthquakes and electricity, when writing of the\r\ndisturbances which shook England in 1849 and 1850, says that the\r\nweather had been unusually warm, the aurora borealis frequent and of\r\nunusually bright colours, whilst the whole year was remarkable for its\r\nfire-balls, lightnings, and corruscations.[111]\r\n\r\nThe aurora was observed before the commencement of the Maestricht\r\nearthquakes in 1751[112]; whilst at the time of the shock flashes of\r\nlight like lightning were observed in the sky.\r\n\r\nGlimmering lights were seen in the sky before the New England\r\nearthquakes (Nov. 18, 1755), and again, before the disturbances which\r\noccurred in the same region in 1727, peculiar flashes of light were\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nPreceding the Sicilian earthquake of 1692 strange lights were seen\r\nin the sky. Ignis fatui have also been observed with earthquakes. At\r\nthe time of auroral displays Bertelli has observed microseismical\r\ndisturbances, and M. S. di Rossi, who has made similar observations,\r\nthinks that there is an intimate connection between the aurora and\r\nearthquakes; the aurora either occurring in a period of earthquakes, or\r\nelse taking the place of earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n BAROMETRICAL FLUCTUATIONS AND EARTHQUAKES—FLUCTUATIONS IN TEMPERATURE\r\n                           AND EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes in the barometer and earthquakes._—Mallet, who collected\r\ntogether a number of examples of earthquakes which have occurred with\r\na fall of the barometer, and a number which have happened with a rise,\r\nconcludes that there are as many instances of the one as of the other.\r\nAt the great earthquake of Calabria, in 1783, the barometer was very\r\nlow. The earthquake of the Rhine (February 23, 1828) was preceded by\r\na gradual fall of the barometer, which reached its lowest point upon\r\nthat day. After the earthquake the barometer again rose. The earthquake\r\nof February 22, 1880, in Japan, was accompanied by exactly similar\r\nphenomena. Caldcleugh, who observed the heavy shocks in Chili (February\r\n20, 1835), noticed that on February 17 and 18 the barometer fell 5/10\r\ninches. Similar phenomena were observed before the succeeding smaller\r\nshocks. After the shocks the barometer again rose. Principal Dawson,\r\nspeaking of the earthquakes of Canada, observes that some of the shocks\r\nhave been accompanied with a low barometer.\r\n\r\nP. Merian, who examined the connection between the Swiss earthquakes\r\nand atmospheric pressure, found that out of twenty-two earthquakes\r\nobserved in Basle between 1755 and 1836, thirteen of these were\r\nlocal shocks, of which eight were accompanied with sudden changes of\r\npressure. Of the remaining nine, which were only felt slightly in\r\nBasle, no change in atmospheric pressure was observed. Of thirty-six\r\nearthquakes which, between 1826 and 1836, were felt in Switzerland,\r\nthirty were chiefly confined to Switzerland, and ten of these occurred\r\nwith a low or falling barometer.\r\n\r\nHumboldt is of opinion that earthquakes only occur with changes in\r\nbarometric pressure in those countries where earthquakes are few; and\r\nhe gives examples where the regular variations of the barometer have\r\ngone on without interruption at the time of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFrederick Hoffmann, who examined fifty-seven earthquakes which occurred\r\nat Palermo between 1788 and 1838, came to the following result:—\r\n\r\n  The barometer was sinking                 in 20 cases\r\n      „          „  rising                  in 16   „\r\n      „          „  at a minimum            in  7   „\r\n      „          „    „  maximum            in  3   „\r\n      „          „  undetermined            in 11   „[113]\r\n\r\nThe observations of M. S. di Rossi apparently show that the earthquakes\r\nin Italy chiefly occur with a barometrical depression and with sudden\r\njumps in atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nSchmidt, who examined the earthquakes of the Orient, which occurred\r\nbetween 1858 and 1873, says that they were rare with a high barometer,\r\nbut numerous when the barometer was low.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of a table of 396 earthquakes (May 8, 1875-Dec.\r\n1881) felt in Tokio, furnished to me by Mr. Arai Ikunosuke, the\r\ndirector of the meteorological department, I obtained the following\r\nresults:—\r\n\r\n  The barometer was rising                  in  169 cases\r\n      „          „  falling                 in  154   „\r\n      „          „  steady                  in   73   „\r\n      „          „  below the monthly mean  in  189   „\r\n      „          „  above        „          in  192   „\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear that in Japan at least the movements of the\r\nbarometer do not show any marked connection with the occurrence of\r\nearthquakes.\r\n\r\nWhen considering this question we must remember the marked effects\r\nwhich a lowering of the barometer produces upon certain volcanoes and\r\nsolfataras. The volumes of steam emitted from Stromboli and from some\r\nof the solfataras in Tuscany hold a marked connection with atmospheric\r\npressure as the quantity of fire damp given off from coal seams—these\r\nbeing greatest when the barometer is low. At certain changes of\r\nthe weather it is said that the volcano of Vulture, near Melfi,\r\nemits noises. These phenomena at once place volcanic phenomena and\r\nbarometrical pressure in direct relationship.\r\n\r\n_Changes in temperature._—If, with an earthquake, it should happen\r\nthat there is a change in the height of the barometer, we should\r\nnaturally expect that this might be accompanied with the changes in the\r\ntemperature, in the wind, and in other atmospheric phenomena which are\r\nmore or less connected with the height of the barometer.\r\n\r\nMany times it has been observed that after an earthquake there has been\r\na sudden fall in the temperature. Such was the case with the Yokohama\r\nearthquakes of 1880.\r\n\r\nCotte endeavours to show that the earthquakes of Lisbon produced a\r\nchange upon the temperature of all Europe. In the year which followed\r\nthis earthquake storms were more common than usual.\r\n\r\nKluge has collected together a large number of examples when there has\r\nbeen a fall of temperature at the time of an earthquake.[114]\r\n\r\nAt Kiachta, in Siberia, at the time of the earthquake of December\r\n27, 1856, the thermometer fell from 12° to 25° R. We must, however,\r\nremember that there are many cases known where the thermometer rose.\r\n\r\nM. S. di Rossi remarks that we have the highest records of temperature\r\nin the years richest in earthquakes. Thus, in 1873, at the time of the\r\nearthquakes in Central and Northern Italy, an abnormal high temperature\r\nwas remarked. Japanese writers have remarked upon the unusual heat\r\nwhich has shaken their countries. The temperature of subterranean\r\nwaters have been known to increase before earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n              RELATION OF SEISMIC TO VOLCANIC PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n  Want of synchronism between earthquakes and volcanic\r\n    eruptions—Synchronism between earthquakes and volcanic\r\n    eruptions—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Connection between earthquakes and volcanic eruptions._—Insomuch as\r\nit is a recognised fact that regions which are characterised by their\r\nseismic activity are chiefly those which are also characterised by\r\nthe number of their volcanoes, it is generally assumed that these\r\ntwo phenomena have an intimate relation. The residents in a volcanic\r\ncountry, when seeking for the origin of an earthquake, invariably turn\r\ntowards the volcanoes which surround them. If a neighbouring volcano\r\nis in a state of activity, it is often regarded as a safeguard against\r\nseismic convulsions, in other cases it is looked upon as being the\r\ncause of such disturbances. In certain instances both of these views\r\nhave apparently been corroborated. When we consider that an earthquake\r\nand a volcanic eruption may both be the result of some great internal\r\nconvulsion, and that first one and then the other may take place in the\r\nsame neighbourhood, it is natural to expect that when these internal\r\nforces have expended themselves in the production of one of these\r\nphenomena, it is not so likely that they should exhibit themselves in\r\nthe other. The inhabitants of Sicily and Naples, we are told, regard\r\neruptions of Etna and Vesuvius as safeguards against earthquakes. A\r\nsimilar belief is to be found in portions of South America with regard\r\nto the volcanoes for which that country is so celebrated.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the records of the large earthquakes and the\r\nvolcanic eruptions which have taken place in Japan during the last\r\n2,000 years, Dr. Naumann found that there was often an approximate\r\ncoincidence between the times of the occurrence of these phenomena,\r\nsuggesting the idea that the efforts which had been sufficient to\r\nestablish the volcano had at the same time been sufficient to shake the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nOf destructive earthquakes which have occurred at the time of volcanic\r\neruptions, and of examples when these phenomena have occurred at widely\r\nseparated intervals, the records are extremely numerous.\r\n\r\n_Want of synchronism between earthquakes and volcanic eruptions._—Many\r\nof the great earthquakes of South America do not appear to have been\r\nconnected with volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe great earthquakes of the world, like those of Calabria and Lisbon,\r\nwhich took place in regions which are not volcanic, have not, Fuchs\r\ntells us, taken place in conjunction with volcanic outbursts.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, as in the Sandwich Islands and in many other parts of the\r\nglobe, the small earthquakes which occur almost daily do not appear to\r\nshow any marked connection with volcanic disturbances.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, during the eruption of Natustake, a volcano lying about a\r\nhundred miles north of Tokio, there was neither an increase nor a\r\ndecrease in the earthquakes which were felt in Tokio. Similar remarks\r\napply to the state of seismic activity of 1876–77, when Oshima, a\r\nvolcanic island about seventy miles to the south of Tokio, was in\r\neruption. In the Sandwich Islands Mauna Loa seems to have its eruptions\r\nindependently of the disturbances which shake these islands.[115]\r\n\r\n_Synchronism of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions._—Although many\r\nexamples like the above may be quoted, which apparently show an utter\r\nwant of connection between earthquakes and volcanoes, we must not\r\noverlook that class of earthquakes which almost invariably accompany\r\nall great volcanic disturbances. In fact the sudden explosions which\r\ntake place at volcanic foci, as, for instance, at the commencement\r\nof an eruption, are enumerated as one of the causes which produce\r\nearthquakes. Earthquakes like these usually continue until the pressure\r\nof the steam and lava have found for themselves an opening. As compared\r\nwith the total number of earthquakes which are recorded, they form but\r\nan insignificant portion.\r\n\r\nThe direct connection which exists between these phenomena has, no\r\ndoubt, done very much to spread the popular belief that all earthquakes\r\nmay be connected with volcanic eruptions. As examples where this\r\nconnection has existed we might quote from almost all the volcanic\r\ncountries in the world.\r\n\r\nThus, Fuchs tells us that on October 6, 1737, almost the whole of\r\nKamschatka and the Kurile Islands were disturbed by movements which\r\nwere simultaneous with the outbreak of the great volcano Klutschenskja\r\nof North Kamschatka.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest records of a severe earthquake and a volcanic\r\neruption occurring simultaneously is found in the accounts of the\r\ndestruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The throwing up of Monte Nuovo\r\nin the neighbourhood of Pozzuoli was accompanied with a dreadful\r\nearthquake.[116]\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the earthquake of Arequipa was accompanied by the opening of\r\nthe volcano Misti, on its north side. The distance to the volcano is\r\nabout fourteen miles.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the eruptions of Kilauea in 1789 the ground shook and\r\nrocked so that persons could not stand.\r\n\r\nThe first eruption of the volcano Irasu, in Costa Rica (1783), was\r\naccompanied by violent earthquakes.[117] The smoke and flames which\r\nare said to have issued from the side of Mount Fojo at the time of the\r\nLisbon earthquake are regarded by some as having been volcanic. Others\r\nthought that the phenomena, rather than being on the side of Fojo,\r\nwhich showed no traces of volcanic action, had taken place in the ocean.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great earthquake at Concepcion (1835), whilst the\r\nwaves were coming in, two great submarine eruptions were observed. One,\r\nbehind the Isle of Quiriquina, appeared like a column of smoke. The\r\nother, in the bay of San Vicente, appeared to form a whirlpool. The\r\nsea-water became black, and had a sulphurous smell, there being a vast\r\neruption of gas in bubbles. Many fish were killed.[118]\r\n\r\nWith this same earthquake, near to Juan Fernandez, about one mile from\r\nthe shore, the sea appeared to boil, and a high column of smoke was\r\nthrown into the air. At night flames were seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, when Mendoza was destroyed and 10,000 inhabitants killed, a\r\nvolcano at the foot of which Mendoza is situated burst into eruption.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake of 1822 at Valdivia was accompanied by eruptions of the\r\nneighbouring mountains, which only lasted a few minutes.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Leghorn shocks (January 16–27, 1742) some fishermen\r\nobserved a part of the sea to rage violently, to raise itself to a\r\ngreat height, and then rush landwards.[119]\r\n\r\nIn 1797, when Riobamba was destroyed, the neighbouring volcanoes were\r\nnot affected, but Mount Pasto, 120 miles distant, suddenly ceased to\r\nthrow out its usual column of water.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 10, 1874, a strong shock was felt in New\r\nEngland, whilst at 4.45 A.M. on December 11 a shock was felt in the Pic\r\ndu Midi, in the Pyrenees. In the middle of December there were volcanic\r\noutbursts in Iceland.[120]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that these occurrences might be the results of some\r\nwidespread disturbance beneath the crust of the earth, or perhaps even\r\nof widely extended earth pulsations. The probability, however, is that\r\nthese coincidences are accidental. When we remember that in a small\r\narea like the northern half of Japan alone there are periods when there\r\nare at least two shocks per day on the average, it is impossible for\r\nthese coincidences not to exist. Less frequently coincidences between\r\nthe larger disturbances must occur. Over and above these accidental\r\ncoincidences, it would appear that in the world’s history periods\r\nhave occurred when earthquakes were unusually frequent, and at such\r\ntimes distant countries have suffered simultaneously. This approximate\r\ncoincidence in period, which has been referred to when speaking of the\r\ndistribution of destructive earthquakes in historical time, does not\r\nimply an exact synchronism in the single shocks.\r\n\r\nSmall earthquakes, or, more properly speaking, local tremblings, are a\r\nnecessary accompaniment of almost all volcanic eruptions. Tremors of\r\nthis description are seldom, however, felt beyond the crater, or at the\r\nmost upon the flanks of the mountain where the eruption is going on.\r\n\r\nThey are due to the explosive action of steam bursting through the\r\nmolten lava.\r\n\r\n_Volcanic eruption succeeding earthquakes._—Sometimes it has happened\r\nthat an earthquake, or a series of earthquakes, have terminated with\r\nthe formation of volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a volcanic outburst terminating a seismic disturbance,\r\nmay be mentioned the appearance of a new volcano in the centre of\r\nLake Ilopango, as a sequel to the shocks which had disturbed that\r\nneighbourhood in 1879.[121]\r\n\r\nIn 1750 there were continuous shakings lasting over three months at\r\nManilla. These terminated with an eruption of a small island in the\r\nmiddle of a neighbouring lake. Three days after the commencement of\r\nthis eruption, four other small islands rose in the same lake.[122]\r\n\r\nAntonio d’Ulloa, when speaking of the Andes, remarks that after a\r\nvolcanic eruption the shocks cease.[123]\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._—Looking at this question generally, insomuch as the\r\ngreatest number of volcanic eruptions appear, according to Fuchs,\r\nto have taken place in summer, whilst the greatest number of its\r\nearthquakes have apparently taken place in winter, it would seem that\r\nthe two phenomena are without any direct connection, unless it be that\r\nboth are different effects of a common cause.\r\n\r\nRegarded in this manner, an earthquake may be looked upon as an\r\nuncompleted effort to establish a volcano. To use the words of Mallet,\r\n‘The forces of explosion and impulse are the same in both; they differ\r\nonly in degree of energy, or on the varying sorts and degrees of\r\nresistance opposed to them.’[124]\r\n\r\nAlthough we have many examples of earthquakes having occurred without\r\nvolcanic eruptions, and, on the other hand, of volcanic eruptions\r\nwithout earthquakes, volcanoes may still be regarded as ‘safety-valves\r\nof the earth’s crust,’ which, by giving relief to internal stresses,\r\nguard us against the effects of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThat many earthquakes are felt at Copiapo is attributed to the fact\r\nthat in the neighbouring mountains there are no volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, overrate the protective influence of volcanoes.\r\nIn the Sandwich Islands we see the columns of liquid lava in\r\nneighbouring mountains standing at different heights, indicating a\r\nwant of subterranean connection between these vents. In consequence\r\nof this it would seem that enormous pressures might be generated in\r\nthe neighbourhood of one of these mountains without finding relief at\r\nthe other. When we have conditions like these, it would seem that the\r\neruption of a volcano may have little or no influence in protecting\r\nneighbouring districts.\r\n\r\nThis may possibly be the explanation of the fact that in 1835\r\nConcepcion was destroyed, notwithstanding there being an unusual\r\nactivity in the volcanic vents of the neighbouring mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                       THE CAUSE OF EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n  Modern views respecting the cause of earthquakes—Earthquakes due\r\n    to faulting—To explosions of steam—To volcanic evisceration—To\r\n    chemical degradation—Attractive influence of the heavenly\r\n    bodies—The effect of oceanic tides—Variation in atmospheric\r\n    pressure—Fluctuation in temperature—Winds and earthquakes—Rain\r\n    and earthquakes—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the results of modern inquiries respecting the cause of earthquakes,\r\nwe see many investigators chiefly attributing these phenomena to\r\nspecial causes. A few attribute them to several causes. It seems to us\r\nthat they might be attributed to very many causes which often act in\r\na complex manner. The primary causes are telluric heats, solar heat,\r\nand variations in gravitating influences. These may be the principal,\r\nand sometimes the immediate, cause of an earthquake. The secondary\r\ncauses are those dependent upon the primary causes, such as expansions\r\nand contractions of the earth’s crust, variations in temperature,\r\nbarometrical pressure, rain, wind, the attractive influences of the\r\nsun and moon in producing tides in the ocean or the earth’s crust,\r\nvariations in the distribution of stress upon the earth’s surface\r\ncaused by processes of degradation, the alterations in the position of\r\nisogeothermal surfaces, &c.\r\n\r\nThe part which may be played by these various causes in the production\r\nof oscillations, pulsations, and tremors will be referred to.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes consequent on faulting._—In the chapter on Earth\r\nOscillations, the causes producing the phenomena of elevation and\r\ndepression are briefly indicated.\r\n\r\nBy the variations in stress accompanying elevations and depressions,\r\ncracks are produced. Inasmuch as compression would crush the rocks\r\nconstituting the earth’s crust, we must conclude with Captain Dutton\r\nthat these cracks are formed by tension. By elevation, the upper rigid\r\ncrust of the earth is stretched, and fissures are produced. The sudden\r\nformation of these fissures or faults gives rise to earthquakes, and\r\nperhaps also to volcanic vents. That earthquake and volcanic regions\r\nare situated on areas where there is evidence of rapid elevation is\r\nstrikingly illustrated round the shores of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLasaulx considered that the earthquake of Herzogenrath was more\r\nor less intimately connected with the great mountain fissure—the\r\n_Feldbiss_—which crosses the coal region of the Wurm.[125] The sudden\r\nelevation or sinking of large areas at the time of an earthquake may be\r\na consequence of these dislocations.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that the earthquake region of Japan\r\nis the one where we have evidence of recent and rapid elevation. That\r\ncertain earthquakes of this region may possibly be the result of\r\nfaulting we have the evidence of our senses and of our instruments. The\r\nsudden blows and jolts which are sometimes felt are indicative of the\r\nsliding of one mass of rock across another.\r\n\r\nShould the ground be simply torn asunder, this tearing would give rise\r\nto a series of waves of distortion, vibrating in directions parallel\r\nto the plane of the fissure. Supposing this motion to be propagated\r\nto a number of surrounding stations, it would be recorded at each of\r\nthese as having the same direction. To those situated on a line forming\r\na continuation of the strike of the fissure, the vibrations would\r\nadvance so to speak _end on_, whilst to those stations lying in a line\r\nperpendicular to the strike of the fissure, the motion would advance\r\n_broadside on_.\r\n\r\nMotions like these latter have been recorded in Tokio, where\r\nearthquakes which from time observations were known to have come from\r\nthe faulted and rising region to the south have been registered as a\r\nseries of east and west motions, or vibrations transverse to this line\r\nof propagation.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be here mentioned that the registration of only\r\ntransverse motion may possibly be due to the extinction of normal\r\nmotion, although this is not generally regarded as probable.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore appear that certain earthquakes and faults are\r\nclosely related phenomena, the former being an immediate effect of\r\nthe latter. Faults are due to earth oscillations, and to a variety of\r\ncauses producing disturbances in the equilibrium of the earth’s crust;\r\nthe principal cause of all these phenomena being alterations in the\r\ndistribution of heat, and the attractive force of gravity.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes consequent on the explosion of steam._—Humboldt regarded\r\nvolcanoes and earthquakes as the results of a common cause, which he\r\nformulated as ‘the reaction of the fiery interior of the earth upon\r\nits rigid crust.’ Certain investigators, who have endeavoured to\r\nreduce Humboldt’s explanation to definite limits, have suggested that\r\nearthquakes may be due to sudden outbursts of steam beneath the crust\r\nof the earth, and its final escape through cracks and fissures.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that steam may accumulate by separating out from the cooling\r\ninterior of our globe, its sudden explosion might be brought about by\r\nits own expansive force, or by the movements in the bubbling mass from\r\nwhich it originated.\r\n\r\nOthers, however, rather than regard the steam as being a primeval\r\nconstituent of the earth’s interior, imagine it arises from the gradual\r\npercolation of water from the surface of the earth down to volcanic\r\nfoci, into which it is admitted against opposing pressures, by virtue\r\nof capillary action.\r\n\r\nMallet, in his account of the Neapolitan earthquake, shows that the\r\nwhole of the observed phenomena can be accounted for by the admission\r\nof steam into a fissure, which by the expansive force exerted on its\r\nwalls was rent open. Just as at the Geysers we hear the thud and\r\nfeel the trembling produced by the sudden evolution and condensation\r\nof steam, so may steam by its sudden evolution and condensation in\r\nthe ground beneath us give rise to a series of shocks of varying\r\nintensity, accompanied by intermediate vibratory motions—that is to\r\nsay, a motion which, as judged of by our feelings, is not unlike many\r\nearthquakes. Often it may happen that the result of the explosion may\r\nbe the production of a fault, or at least a fissure; and thus in the\r\nresulting movements we may have a variety of vibrations, some being\r\nthose of compression and distortion, produced by the blow of the\r\nexplosion, and others being those of distortion alone, produced by the\r\nshearing action which may have taken place by the opening of the fault.\r\nSometimes one set of these vibrations may be prominent, and sometimes\r\nthe other. Thus, when we say that an earthquake has shown evidence by\r\nthe nature of its vibrations that it was produced by a fault, this\r\nby no means precludes the possibility that an explosion of steam may\r\nalso have been connected with the production of the disturbance.\r\nMallet threw out the suggestion that the opening of fissures beneath\r\nthe ocean might admit water to volcanic foci. During the time that the\r\nwater was in the spheroidal state, the preliminary tremors, so common\r\nto many earthquakes, would be produced. These would be followed by the\r\nexplosion, or series of explosions, constituting the shock or shocks of\r\nthe earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe chief reasons for believing that the earthquakes of North-Eastern\r\nJapan are partly due to explosive efforts are:—\r\n\r\n1. That the greater number of disturbances, perhaps ninety per cent.,\r\noriginate beneath the sea, where we may imagine that the ground,\r\nunder the superincumbent hydrostatic pressure, is continuously being\r\nsaturated with moisture.\r\n\r\n2. Many of the diagrams show that the prominent vibrations, of which\r\nthere are usually from one to three, in a given disturbance have the\r\nsame character as those produced by an explosive like dynamite, the\r\ngreatest and probably the most rapid motions being inwards towards the\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that a very large proportion of the destructive\r\nearthquakes of the world have originated beneath the sea, as has often\r\nbeen testified by the succeeding sea waves. Also, it must be observed,\r\nthat earthquake countries, like volcanic countries, are chiefly those\r\nwhich have a coast line sloping at a steep angle beneath the sea—that\r\nis to say, earthquakes are frequent along coasts bordered by deep water.\r\n\r\nThe earthquakes which occur at volcanic foci constitute another class\r\nof disturbances which may be accredited to the explosive efforts of\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes due to volcanic evisceration._—By the ejection of ashes\r\nand lava from volcanic vents, there is an extensive evisceration of\r\nthe neighbouring ground. When we look at a volcano like Fujiyama,\r\n13,000 feet in height, and at least fifty miles in circumference, and\r\nremember that the mass of cinders and slag of which it is composed\r\ncame from beneath the area on which it rests, the point to be wondered\r\nat is, that earthquakes, consequent on the collapse of subterranean\r\nhollows, are not more frequent than they are. At the time of a single\r\neruption of a volcano, the quantity of lava ejected amounts to many\r\nthousand millions of cubic feet. In 1783 the quantity of lava ejected\r\nfrom Skaptas Joknee, in Iceland, was estimated as surpassing ‘in\r\nmagnitude the bulk of Mont Blanc.’[126] Admitting that hollow spaces\r\nare the results of these eruptions, and that in consequence of this\r\nevisceration the ground is rendered unstable, the instability being\r\nincreased by the additional load placed above the eviscerated area, it\r\nwould seem that from time to time earthquakes are inevitable.\r\n\r\nFacts, however, teach us that volcanoes act as safety valves, and\r\nthat, as a rule, at or shortly after an eruption, earthquakes cease.\r\nThe relationship of earthquakes to volcanic eruptions would therefore\r\nindicate, notwithstanding the arguments put forward to show that an\r\narea loaded by a volcano has in consequence of the evisceration and the\r\nload a quaquaversal dip, that evisceration does not take place beneath\r\nvolcanoes as is usually supposed, and we may conclude that it is but\r\nfew earthquakes which have an origin due to these causes.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes and evisceration by chemical degradation._—A powerful\r\nagent, which tends to the formation of subterranean hollows, is\r\nchemical degradation. The effects of this have been often measured by\r\nquantitative analysis of the solid materials which are daily carried\r\naway by many of our springs. In limestone districts this is very great.\r\nProf. Ramsay estimates that the mineral matter discharged annually by\r\nthe hot springs of Bath is equivalent in bulk to a column 140 feet in\r\nheight and 9 feet in diameter. At San Filippo, in Tuscany, the solid\r\nmatter discharged from the springs has formed a hill a mile and a\r\nquarter long, a third of a mile broad, and 250 feet in thickness.[127]\r\nMany other examples of subterranean chemical degradation will be found\r\nin text-books of geology.\r\n\r\nBy this chemical action large cavernous hollows are produced. Beneath\r\na volcano it is probable that liquid material immediately takes the\r\nplace of that which is ejected, and that hollows are not formed as in\r\nthe case of chemical degradation. If a cavern becomes too large, it\r\neventually collapses.\r\n\r\nOf the falling in of large excavations we have examples in large mines.\r\nAs a consequence, not only is a trembling produced, but also a noise,\r\nwhich is so like that produced by certain earthquakes that the South\r\nAmerican miners have but one word, ‘bramido,’ to express both.[128]\r\n\r\nBoussingault, who was an advocate for the theory that many earthquakes\r\nare produced by the sinking of the ground, calls attention to the fact\r\nthat we have evidences of the subsidence of great mountains, like\r\nthe Andes, the districts around which are so well known for their\r\nearthquakes. Capac Urcu is one of these mountains which legends tell us\r\nhas decreased in height.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the height of mountains is a subject which deserves\r\nattention. That mountains may possibly be hollow, we have the\r\nremarkable results attained by Captain Herschel, who found that the\r\nattractive force of gravity in the neighbourhood of the Himalayas was\r\nnot so great as it ought to have been had these mountains been solid.\r\nThe Rev. O. Fisher gives another explanation of this phenomenon.\r\nPalmieri considers that the terrible earthquake which devastated\r\nCasamicciola (1881) was due to the hot springs having gradually eaten\r\nout cavernous spaces beneath the town. The extremely local character of\r\nthis shock was certainly favourable to such a view.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake which, in 1840, caused Mount Cernans, in the Jura, to\r\nfall, is also attributed to the solvent action of waters in undermining\r\nits foundations. This undermining action was in great measure probably\r\ndue to a large spring, which, twenty-five years previously, had\r\ndisappeared, and which subsequently may possibly have been slowly\r\ndisintegrating the foundations of the mountain. Earthquakes of this\r\norder would be principally confined to districts where there are rocks\r\nwhich are more or less soluble, as, for instance, rock salt, gypsum,\r\nand limestone.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes and the attractive influences of the heavenly bodies._—The\r\nmost important attractions exercised upon our planet are those due to\r\nthe sun and moon. To these influences we owe the tides in our ocean,\r\nand possibly elastic tides in the earth’s crust. Some theorists would\r\nalso insist upon liquid tides in the fluid interior of our earth. The\r\nnature of the earth’s interior is, however, a question on which there\r\nis a diversity of opinion.\r\n\r\nOne doctrine, which, until recent years, received much support, was\r\nthat the interior of the earth was a reservoir of molten matter\r\ncontained within a thin crust. Hopkins showed that the least\r\npossible thickness of such a crust must be from 800 or 1,000 miles,\r\notherwise the motions of precession and nutation would be subject to\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nM. Delauney objected to the views of Hopkins, on the supposition that\r\nthe fluid interior of the earth had a certain viscosity.\r\n\r\nSir William Thomson arrives at the conclusion that the earth on the\r\nwhole must be more rigid than a continuous solid globe of glass. Mr.\r\nGeorge H. Darwin’s investigations on the bodily tides of viscous or\r\nsemi-elastic spheroids tend to strengthen the arguments of Sir William\r\nThomson.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers hold the view that the central portion of the earth,\r\nalthough intensely hot, is solid by pressure, whilst the outer crust is\r\nsolid by cooling. Between the two there is a shell of liquid or viscous\r\nmolten matter.\r\n\r\nAnother argument is, that although the interior of the globe may be\r\nsolid, it is only retained in that condition by an immense pressure, on\r\nthe relief of which it is liquefied—it is potentially liquid.\r\n\r\nAs these views, and the arguments for and against them, are to be\r\nfound in all modern text-books of geology, we will at once proceed\r\nto consider the effect of solar and lunar attractive influences in\r\nproducing earthquakes upon a globe which is either solid, partially\r\nsolid, or which has an interior wholly liquid.\r\n\r\n_Effect of the attractive influences of the sun and moon._—In 1854\r\nM. F. Zantedeschi put forward the view—that it is probable there is\r\na continual tendency of the earth to protuberance in the direction\r\nof the radii vectores of the two luminaries which attract it. In\r\nconsequence of these protuberances, pendulums ought at one time to\r\nswing more slowly than at others. Zantedeschi remarks that the periods\r\nof earthquakes appear to confirm such a view, insomuch as they occur\r\nmore often at the syzygies, or epoch of the spring tides, than at neap\r\ntides—an observation found in the works of Georges Baglivi (1703) and\r\nJoseph Toaldo (1770).[129]\r\n\r\nProf. Perrey, of Dijon, who did so much for seismology, held the view\r\nthat the preponderance in the number of earthquakes felt at particular\r\nseasons was possibly due to the attractive influence of the sun and\r\nmoon producing a tide in the fluid interior of the earth, which, acting\r\non the solid crust, produced fractures.\r\n\r\nRudolf Falb, whose writings have of late years attracted considerable\r\nattention, brings forward views which may be regarded as amplifications\r\nof those suggested by Perrey.\r\n\r\nAccording to Falb, the inner portion of the earth must be regarded as\r\nfluid. In the crust above this fluid reservoir are cracks and channels,\r\ninto which, by the attraction of the moon and sun, the fluid is drawn.\r\nOn entering these cracks cooling takes place, together with explosions\r\nof gas and subterranean volcanic disturbances. The attractions\r\nproducing the internal tides required by Falb are chiefly dependent\r\nupon the following factors:—\r\n\r\n1. The nearness and distance of the sun from the earth (January 1 and\r\nJuly 1).\r\n\r\n2. The position of the moon with regard to the earth, which in every\r\ntwenty-seven days is once near and once distant.\r\n\r\n3. The phases of the moon—whether full or new moon (syzygies), or\r\nwhether first or last quarter (quadratures).\r\n\r\n4. The equinoxes, the position of the sun in the equator, and the\r\nrelative position of the earth.\r\n\r\n5. The position of the moon relative to the equator.\r\n\r\n6. The concurrence of the ‘centrifugal force’ of the earth with the\r\nlast quarter of the moon.\r\n\r\n7. The entrance of the moon on the ecliptic—the so-called nodes.\r\n\r\nAssuming that earthquakes are wholly consequent on these attractions,\r\nit at once becomes possible to predict their occurrence. This Falb\r\ndoes, and when his predictions have been fulfilled he has certainly\r\ngained notoriety.\r\n\r\nHe commenced by the predictions of great storms. In 1873 he predicted\r\nthe destructive earthquake of Belluno, which earned for himself a\r\neulogistic poem, which he has republished in his ‘Gedanken und Studien\r\nüber Vulkanismus.’ After this, in 1874, he predicted the eruption of\r\nEtna. He also explained why, in B.C. 4000, there should have been a\r\ngreat flood, and for A.D. 6400 he predicts a repetition of such an\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nWhen we approach the question of the extent to which the attraction\r\nof the sun and moon may influence the production of earthquakes, a\r\nquestion which we have to answer is, whether it is likely that the\r\nattractive power of the moon is so great that it could draw up the\r\ncrust the earth beyond its elastic limits. We know what it can do with\r\nwater. It can lift up a hemispherical shell 8,000 miles in diameter\r\nabout two or three feet higher at its crown than it lifts the earth.\r\nEven supposing the solid crust to be lifted 100 times the apparent\r\nrise of the tide, is it likely that a hemispherical arch 8,000 miles\r\nin diameter when it is raised 200 feet at its crown could by any\r\npossibility suffer fracture? If an arch is 12,000 miles in length, all\r\nthat we here ask is, whether the materials which compose the arch are\r\nsufficiently elastic to allow themselves to be so far stretched that\r\nthe crown may be raised 200 feet. The result which we should arrive\r\nat is apparently so obvious that actual calculation seems hardly\r\nnecessary. If we regard the earth as being solid, the question resolves\r\nitself into the inquiry as to whether a column of rock, which is equal\r\nin length to the diameter of the earth, or about 8,000 miles, can be\r\nelongated 200 feet without a fracture. This is equivalent to asking\r\nwhether a piece of rock one yard in length can be stretched one seventy\r\nthousandth of a foot. Considering that this is a quantity which is\r\nscarcely appreciable under the most powerful of our microscopes, we\r\nmust also regard this as a question which it is hardly necessary to\r\nenter into calculations about before giving it an answer. To vary\r\nthe method of treating such a question, may we not ask what is the\r\nutmost limit to which it would be possible to raise up or stretch the\r\ncrust of the earth without danger of a fracture? Thus, for instance,\r\nto what extent might a column of rock be elongated without danger\r\nof its being broken? From what we know of the tenacity of materials\r\nlike brick and their moduli of elasticity, it would seem possible to\r\nstretch a bar of rock 8,000 miles in length for approximately half\r\na mile before expecting it to break. As to whether there is a wave,\r\nthe height of which is equal to half this quantity, running round our\r\nearth as successive portions of its surface pass beneath the attracting\r\ninfluences of the sun and moon, is a phenomenon which, if it exists,\r\nwould probably long ago have met with a practical demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe deformation which a solid globe or spherical shell would\r\nexperience under the attractive influences of the sun and moon has\r\nbeen investigated by Lamé, Thomson, Darwin, and other physicists and\r\nmathematicians.\r\n\r\nA conclusion that we are led to as one result of these valuable\r\ninvestigations is, that if the interior of the earth be fluid, and\r\ncovered with a thin shell, then enormous elastic tides must be\r\nproduced. A consequent phenomenon, dependent on the existence of these\r\ntides, would be a marked regularity in the occurrence of earthquakes.\r\nAs this marked regularity does not exist, we must conclude that\r\nearthquakes are not due to the attractive influences of the sun and\r\nmoon acting upon the thin crust of the earth covering a fluid interior.\r\nThe periodicity of earthquakes corroborates the conclusions of Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson, who remarks that if the earth were not extremely rigid\r\nthe enormous elastic tides which must result would be sufficient to\r\nlift the waters of the ocean up and down so that the oceanic tide would\r\nbe obliterated.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the earth has the rigidity assigned to it by mathematical\r\nand physical investigators, we nevertheless have travelling round our\r\nearth, following the attractions of the moon and sun, a tidal stress.\r\nThis stress, imposed upon an area in a critical state, may cause it to\r\ngive way, and thus be the origin of an earthquake. Earthquakes ought\r\ntherefore to be more numerous when these stresses are the greatest.\r\n\r\nThe periods of maximum stress or greatest pull exerted by the moon and\r\nsun will occur when these bodies are nearest to our planet—that is, in\r\nperigee and perihelion, and again when they are acting in conjunction\r\nor at the syzygies. That earthquakes are _slightly_ more numerous\r\nat these particular periods than at others is a strong reason for\r\nbelieving that the attractions of the moon and sun enter into the list\r\nof causes producing these phenomena.\r\n\r\nHad there been a strongly marked distinction in the number of\r\nearthquakes occurring at these particular seasons as compared with\r\nothers, we might have attributed earthquakes to the existence of\r\nelastic tides of a sensible magnitude. As the facts stand, it appears\r\nthat the maximum pulls exerted by the moon and sun are only sufficient\r\nto cause a slight preponderance in the number of earthquakes felt at\r\nparticular seasons, and therefore that these pulls only result in\r\nearthquakes when the distorting effort has been exerted on an area\r\nwhich, by volcanic evisceration, the pressure of included gases, and\r\nother causes, is on the verge of yielding.\r\n\r\n_Earthquakes and the tides._—If we assume that earthquakes are in many\r\ncases due to the overloading of an area and its consequent fracture,\r\nsuch loading may occur by the rising of the tide. A belief that the\r\nearthquakes of Japan were attributable to the tides may be found in the\r\ndiary of Richard Cocks under the date November 7, 1618, who remarks:—\r\n\r\n‘And, as we retorned, about ten aclock, hapned a greate earthquake,\r\nwhich caused many people to run out of their howses. And about the lyke\r\nhower the night following hapned an other, this countrey being much\r\nsubject to them. And that which is comunely markd, they allwais hapen\r\nat a hie water (or full sea); so it is thought it chauseth per reason\r\nis much wind blowen into hollow caves under ground at a loe water, and\r\nthe sea flowing in after, and stoping the passage out, causeth these\r\nearthquakes, to fynd passage or vent for the wind shut up.’[130]\r\n\r\nAlthough we may not acquiesce in Cock’s views respecting the imprisoned\r\nwind, it would seem that a comparison of the occurrence of earthquakes\r\nand the state of the tide would be a legitimate research. Inasmuch\r\nas the stresses which are brought to bear upon an area by the rising\r\nof the tide are so very much greater than those due to barometrical\r\nchanges, it is not unlikely that a marked connection would be found.\r\nBut it must be remembered that because researches, so far as they have\r\ngone, tend to show that earth movements are more frequent when an area\r\nis relieved of a load, it is not unlikely that the greatest number of\r\nearthquakes may be found to occur at low water. Prof. W. S. Chaplin\r\nattempted to make this investigation in Japan, but not being able to\r\nobtain the necessary information respecting the tides, was compelled to\r\nrelinquish this interesting work.\r\n\r\nEvery foot of rise in a tide is equivalent to a load being placed on\r\nthe area over which the tide takes place of sixty-two pounds to the\r\nsquare foot. This load is not evenly distributed, but stops abruptly at\r\na coast line. Lastly, it may be observed that many coast lines are not\r\nsimultaneously subjected to stresses consequent upon this load. Japan,\r\nfor instance, may be regarded as an arch placed horizontally. The\r\narea near the crown of this arch is loaded by the tidal wave crossing\r\nthe Pacific before the areas near the abutment, and farther there is\r\na horizontal pressure at the crown which, if Japan were like a raft,\r\nwould tend, as the tide advanced, to straighten its bow-like form, but\r\nas the wave passed its abutments to increase its curvature.\r\n\r\nProf. G. Darwin has calculated the amount of rise and fall of a shore\r\nline due to tidal loads (see p. 336, ‘Earth Pulsations’). The result\r\nof these calculations apparently indicates that these loads may have a\r\nconsiderable influence upon the stability of an area in a more or less\r\ncritical condition.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Carruthers suggests that tidal action may hold a general but\r\nindirect relationship to volcanic and seismic action by the retardation\r\nit causes on the earth’s rotation. By this retardation the polar axis\r\ntends to lengthen, and tensile stresses are induced, resulting in\r\nfracture. The fluid interior of the earth, being no longer restrained,\r\nwould move polewards, and, leaving equatorial portions unsupported,\r\nthis would gradually collapse. The primary fractures would be north and\r\nsouth, while the secondary fractures would be east and west.[131]\r\n\r\nThat the rise of the tide is accompanied by a greater percolation\r\nof water to volcanic foci, which, in consequence, assume a greater\r\nstate of activity, is a theory which was advanced many years ago. To\r\ndetermine how far tides may directly be connected with earthquakes, the\r\nnecessary records have yet to be examined.\r\n\r\n_Variations in atmospheric pressure._—When we consider the immense\r\nload which, by a sudden rise of the barometer, is placed upon the area\r\nover which this rise takes place, it is not difficult to imagine that\r\nthis rise may occasionally be the final cause which makes the crust of\r\nthe earth to give way. A barometric rise of an inch is equivalent to a\r\nload of about seventy-two pounds being put upon every square foot of\r\narea over which this rise takes place. On the other hand, a fall in the\r\nbarometric column indicates that a load has been removed, and whatever\r\nelastic effort may be exerted by subterranean forces in endeavouring to\r\nescape, being met by less resistance, they may burst these bonds, and\r\nan earthquake will result. For reasons such as these the final cause\r\nof earthquakes has often been attributed to variations in atmospheric\r\npressure. In Japan there are practically as many earthquakes with a\r\nhigh barometer as with a low one.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which barometric fluctuations have acted as final causes\r\nin the production of earthquakes may be judged of by a comparison of\r\nthe times of barometric variation and the times at which earthquakes\r\nhave occurred.\r\n\r\nThree important laws of barometric variation are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. In the world generally the average barometric pressure is highest in\r\nwinter. (Exceptions occur near Iceland and in the North Pacific.)\r\n\r\n2. The summer and winter monthly mean barometer differs least near the\r\nequator and over the great oceans. They differ most over the great\r\ncontinents and generally with increasing latitude.\r\n\r\n3. The greatest number of barometrical fluctuations usually take place\r\nin winter.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as there are generally more earthquakes in winter than in\r\nsummer, the first of these laws would indicate that this might be due\r\nto the greater load which acts upon the crust of the earth at that\r\nseason. The second law would indicate that the distinction between\r\nthe winter and summer earthquakes ought to be most marked in high\r\nlatitudes, which, if we refer to the table on p. 257, we observe to be\r\nborne out by the results of observation. The countries where there are\r\nas many earthquakes in winter as in summer are chiefly those in low\r\nlatitudes. The number of these countries from which we have records\r\nare, however, few.\r\n\r\nFacts opposed to the idea that earthquakes may be caused by an increase\r\nof barometric pressure are the results of observations like those of\r\nSchmidt and Rossi, which show that earthquakes chiefly occur with a low\r\nbarometer.\r\n\r\nAssuming that these latter observations will be found by future\r\ninvestigators to be generally true, we must conclude that the relief\r\nof atmospheric pressure has an influence upon the occurrence of\r\nearthquakes. Such a conclusion would partially accord with the third\r\nbarometrical law, or the fact that there are more occasions on which we\r\nget a low barometer during the winter months.\r\n\r\nOther writers who have examined this question are Volger, Kluge,\r\nAndrès, and Poly. The latter investigator sought a connection between\r\nearthquakes and revolving storms, in the centres of which there is\r\nusually an abnormal decrease of atmospheric pressure. If an area over\r\nwhich such a sudden change in pressure took place was in a critical\r\nstate, it is not difficult to see that storms such as Poly refers to\r\nmight sometimes be accompanied by earthquakes.\r\n\r\n_Fluctuations in temperature._—Inasmuch as fluctuations in temperature\r\nare governed by the sun, it may at once be said that there is a\r\nconnection between earthquakes and readings of the thermometer.\r\nCertainly earthquakes occur mostly during the cold months or in\r\nwinter. Similarly, as changes in temperature are so closely connected\r\nwith barometric fluctuations, and these are said to have a direct\r\ninfluence upon the yielding of the earth’s crust, seismic phenomena are\r\nindirectly linked to fluctuations in temperature. A rise in temperature\r\nis usually accompanied by a fall in the barometer, and this in turn may\r\nbe a condition favourable for the occurrence of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nIf we regard solar heat as an agent causing expansions or contractions\r\nin the earth’s crust, then fluctuations in temperature become an\r\nimmediate cause of earthquakes. The probability, however, is that\r\nsolar heat has little or no connection with the final cause producing\r\nearthquakes, although at the same time coincidences between the\r\noccurrence of earthquakes and unusual fluctuations in temperature may\r\nfrom time to time be observed.\r\n\r\n_Winds and earthquakes._—Although it may be admitted that high winds\r\nexert enormous pressures upon mountain ranges, and might occasionally\r\ngive rise to stresses causing rocky masses in unstable equilibrium to\r\ngive way, the coincidences which have been established between the\r\noccurrence of storms and earthquakes can usually only be regarded as\r\noccurrences which have synchronised by chance.\r\n\r\nStorms are usually accompanied with a barometric depression, and the\r\nrelation of diminutions in atmospheric pressure to earthquakes has been\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n_Rain and earthquakes._—It has already been shown that earthquakes\r\nhave occasionally been found to coincide with rain and rainy seasons.\r\nWhether the saturation of the ground with moisture or the percolation\r\nof the same to volcanic foci may be a direct effect producing\r\nearthquakes it is difficult to say. The probability, however, is\r\nthat, rain being dependent on phenomena like changes in temperature,\r\nbarometric fluctuations, and winds, we must regard it and the\r\nearthquakes which happen to coincide with these precipitations of\r\nmoisture as congruent effects of more general causes.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._—Although it would be an easy matter to discuss the\r\nrelationship of earthquakes and other phenomena, we must conclude\r\nthat the primary cause of earthquakes is endogenous to our earth, and\r\nthat exogenous phenomena, like the attraction of the sun and moon and\r\nbarometric fluctuations, play but a small part in the actual production\r\nof these phenomena, their greatest effect being to cause a slight\r\npreponderance in the number of earthquakes at particular seasons. They\r\nmay, therefore, sometimes be regarded as final causes. The majority of\r\nearthquakes are due to explosive efforts at volcanic foci. The greater\r\nnumber of these explosions take place beneath the sea, and are probably\r\ndue to the admission of water through fissures to the heated rocks\r\nbeneath. A smaller number of earthquakes originate at actual volcanoes.\r\nSome earthquakes are produced by the sudden fracture of rocky strata or\r\nthe production of faults. This may be attributable to stresses brought\r\nabout by elevatory pressure. Lastly, we have earthquakes due to the\r\ncollapse of underground excavations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                      PREDICTION OF EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\n  General nature of predictions—Prediction by the observation of\r\n    unusual phenomena (alteration in the appearance and taste of\r\n    springs; underground noises; preliminary tremors; earthquake\r\n    prophets—warnings furnished by animals, &c.)—Earthquake warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General nature of predictions._—Ever since seismology has been\r\nstudied, one of the chief aims of its students has been to discover\r\nsome means which would enable them to foretell the coming of an\r\nearthquake, and the attempts which have been made by workers in various\r\ncountries to correlate these occurrences with other well-marked\r\nphenomena may be regarded as attempts in this direction.\r\n\r\nAbility to herald the approach of these calamities would unquestionably\r\nbe an inestimable boon to all who dwell in earthquake-shaken countries,\r\nand the attempts which have been made both here and in other places are\r\nextremely praiseworthy. In almost all countries where earthquakes are\r\nof common occurrence these movements of the earth have been more or\r\nless connected with certain phenomena which, in the popular mind, are\r\nsupposed to be associated with an approach of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nIf predictions were given in general terms, and they only referred\r\nto time, inasmuch as on the average there are in the world several\r\nshakings per day, we should always find that predictions were\r\nverified. We might even go further and predict that on certain days\r\nearthquakes would occur in certain countries, and still find that in\r\nmany instances our supposed power of foresight had not deceived us.\r\nThus, for instance, in Japan, where on the average there are probably\r\none or two shakings every day, if prognostications were never correct\r\nthere would be a violation of the laws of chance.\r\n\r\nWhat is required from those who undertake to forewarn us of an\r\nearthquake is an indication not only of the time at which the\r\ndisturbance will happen, but also an indication of the area in which\r\nit is to occur. Those who dwell in an area where there are certain\r\nwell-defined periods during which seismic activity is at a maximum—if\r\nten or fourteen days should have passed without a shock—might, in many\r\ninstances, find that a prophecy that there would be an earthquake\r\nwithin the next few days would prove itself correct. Also, if a severe\r\nshock had taken place, a prophecy that there would be a second or\r\nthird smaller disturbance within a short period would also meet with\r\nverification.\r\n\r\nCertain persons with whom I am intimate appear to have persuaded\r\nthemselves that they can foretell the coming of an earthquake by the\r\nsultry state of the atmosphere or a certain oppressiveness they feel,\r\nand an instinctive feeling arises that an earthquake is at hand.\r\n\r\nIt is said that a few minutes before many of the shocks which shook\r\nNew England between 1827 and 1847 people could foretell the coming\r\ndisturbance by an alteration in their stomach.[132] No doubt many who\r\ndwell in earthquake countries, and have been alarmed by earthquakes,\r\nare at times subject to nervous expectancy.\r\n\r\nThe author has had such sensations himself, due, perhaps, to a\r\nknowledge that it was the earthquake season, that there had been no\r\ndisturbance for some weeks, and a consequent increasing state of\r\nnervous presentments. In consequence of this, not only has he carefully\r\nprepared his instruments for the coming shock, but he has written and\r\ntelegraphed to friends to do the same.\r\n\r\nSometimes these guesses have proved correct. One remarkable instance\r\nwas a few hours prior to the severe shock of February 22, 1880, when\r\nhe communicated with his friends in Yokohama and asked them to see\r\nthat their instruments were in good order. Oftener, however, his\r\nprognostications have been incorrect. The point in connection with\r\nthis subject which he wishes to be remarked is, that the instances\r\nwhere earthquakes occurred shortly after the receipt of his letters\r\nare carefully remembered, and often mentioned, but the instances in\r\nwhich earthquakes did not occur appear to be entirely forgotten. He is\r\nled to mention these facts because they appear to be an experimental\r\nproof of what has taken place in bygone times, and what still takes\r\nplace, especially amongst savages—namely, that the record of that which\r\nis remarkable survives, whilst that which is of every-day occurrence\r\nquickly dies. Had the records of all prognostications been preserved,\r\nthe probability is that we should find that they had, in the majority\r\nof cases, been incorrect, whilst it would have been but in very few\r\ninstances they had been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n_Prediction by the observation of natural phenomena._—The above remarks\r\nmay perhaps help us to understand the prognostications of the ancient\r\nphilosophers about which Professor Antonio Favaro, of Padua, has\r\nwritten.[133] Cicero in the ‘De Divinatione,’ speaking on this subject,\r\nsays that ‘God has not predicted so much as the divine intelligence of\r\nman.’—‘Non Deus prævidet tantum, sed et divini in genii viri.’ Favaro\r\nregards these predictions, however, as the result of observations of\r\nnature which show it is possible that indications of coming earthquakes\r\nhad been announced by variations in the gas given out from subterranean\r\nsources, the change in colour, taste, level, temperature of the water\r\nin springs, &c.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 a bishop of Ischia forewarned his people of a conning\r\nearthquake, and thus was instrumental in the saving of many lives.\r\nNaturally, in an age of superstition, the bishop would be regarded as\r\na prophet, but Favaro considers that the prognostication was probably\r\ndue to a knowledge of premonitory signs as exhibited in changes in the\r\ncharacters of mineral waters.\r\n\r\nThe shock of 1851, at Melfi, was in this way predicted by the Capuchin\r\nfathers, who observed that a lake near their door became frothy and\r\nturbulent.\r\n\r\nUnderground noises have led persons to the belief that an earthquake\r\nwas at hand. It was in this way that Viduari, a prisoner at Lima,\r\npredicted the destruction of that city.\r\n\r\nBefore the earthquake of 1868, so severely felt at Iquique, the\r\ninhabitants were terrified by loud subterranean noises.\r\n\r\nThat underground noises have preceded earthquakes by considerable\r\nintervals appears to be a fact, but, at the same time, it must\r\nbe remembered that similar noises have often occurred without an\r\nearthquake having taken place.\r\n\r\nFarmers predicted the earthquake of St. Remo, in 1831, by underground\r\nnoises.\r\n\r\nOn the day before the earthquake which, in 1873, shook Mount Baldo,\r\nthe inhabitants of Puos, a village north of Lake Santa Croce, heard\r\nunderground noises.\r\n\r\nBefore the earthquakes which, in 1783, shook Calabria and Sicily, fish\r\nare said to have appeared in great numbers on the coast of Sicily, and\r\nthe whirlpool of Charybdis assumed an unusual excited state.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Pherecydes predicted the earthquakes of Lacedemon and\r\nHelm out, by the taste of the water in the very deep well at the castle\r\nof Lovain.[134]\r\n\r\nThe writer of an article on the Lisbon earthquake says that ‘after the\r\n24th I felt apprehensive, as I observed the same prognostics as on the\r\nafternoon of October 31, that is, the weather was severe, the wind\r\nnortherly, a fog came from the sea, the water in a fountain ran of a\r\nyellow clay colour, and’ he adds, ‘from midnight to the morning of the\r\n25th I felt five shocks.’[135]\r\n\r\nAt the present time Rudolf Falb, following a theory based upon the\r\nattractive influences of the sun and moon, tells us the time at which\r\nwe are to expect earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThat occasionally there are signs attendant on earthquakes, although\r\nwe cannot give them a physical explanation, we cannot doubt. Also we\r\nknow that in certain areas earthquakes are more likely to occur at\r\none season than at another. Should earthquakes be foretold with the\r\nassistance of knowledge of this description, the predictions at once\r\nbecome the result of the application of certain natural laws, and are\r\nnot to be regarded as predictions in the popularly accepted sense of\r\nthat term, any more than the arrival of a friend is predicted by the\r\nprevious receipt of a telegram announcing his coming.\r\n\r\nRather than accredit the ancients and those of more modern times who,\r\nin consequence of their feelings, have recorded the coming of an\r\nearthquake, with a knowledge of premonitory signs, we might in many\r\ninstances regard the records of those prognostications as the survival\r\nof accidental guesses, and, as such, examples of the survival of the\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThe effect of accidental occurrences of this description upon an\r\nuneducated mind, in engendering superstition, is a subject which has\r\noften been dwelt upon, and the difficulty of eradicating the same—as\r\nmay be judged of by the following accident which came under the\r\nobservation of Mr. T. B. Lloyd and the author, in 1873, when travelling\r\nin Newfoundland—will be easily appreciated.\r\n\r\nAt the time to which I refer, my companion was bringing a canoe down\r\nthe rapids below the Grand Pond in a country which is practically\r\nuninhabited, and where an Indian trapper would perhaps be the only\r\nperson met with, and this not more than once a year. Whilst shooting\r\nthe rapids one of the Indians, Reuben Soulian, shot at a deer passing\r\nup one bank of the river. That the deer had been hit was testified by a\r\ntrail of blood which bespattered the rocks. Subsequently several more\r\nshots were fired, and it was believed by all that the deer was killed.\r\nSoulian quickly followed the animal to the spot where it was supposed\r\nto have fallen. Some time after he returned, having failed to find any\r\ntrace of the animal. He was greatly agitated, but eventually became\r\nmelancholy, saying that the sudden disappearance of the animal was a\r\nsure sign that some of his relations had suddenly died. About two hours\r\nafterwards Mr. Lloyd’s party met with a party of Indians coming up\r\nthe river, the first they had seen for four weeks, who told them that\r\nSoulian’s sister had just died on the coast.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of South America certain shocks are anticipated by\r\npreliminary vibrations which cause a little bell attached to a T-shaped\r\nframe (cruz sonante) to ring. There are, however, persons (trembloron)\r\nwho are supposed to be endowed with seismic foresight, whose verdicts\r\nare much relied upon.\r\n\r\nIn Caraccas it is said that nearly every street in the river suburb has\r\nan earthquake Cassandra or two. Some of these go so far not only as\r\nto predict the coming seisms, but also the vicissitudes of particular\r\nstreets.[136] Earthquake prophets are, however, by no means confined to\r\nthe new world, and many examples of them may be found in the histories\r\nof countries where earthquakes have been felt.\r\n\r\nThe story of the crazy lifeguardsman who prophesied an earthquake to\r\ntake place in London on April 4, 1691, is an example. The Rev. Sig.\r\nPasquel E. Perdini, writing on the earthquakes at Leghorn in 1742,\r\nsays that ‘a Milanese astrologer predicted this earthquake for January\r\n27, by which “misfortune” the faith and credit given to the astrologer\r\ngained him more reverence and honour than the prophets and holy\r\ngospel.’ Before the time at which he predicted a second shock, people\r\nremoved away from Leghorn.\r\n\r\n_Warnings furnished by animals._—A study of the warnings furnished by\r\nanimals is also interesting. Several of the natives in Caraccas possess\r\noracular quadrupeds, such as dogs, cats, and jerboas, which anticipate\r\ncoming dangers by their restlessness.\r\n\r\nBefore the catastrophe of 1812, at Caraccas, a Spanish stallion broke\r\nout from its stable and escaped to the highlands, which was regarded\r\nas the result of the prescience of a coming calamity. Before the\r\ndisturbances of 1822 and 1835, which shook Chili, immense flocks of sea\r\nbirds flew inland, as if they had been alarmed by the commencement of\r\nsome suboceanic disturbance. Before this last shock it is also related\r\nthat all the dogs escaped from the city of Talcahuano.\r\n\r\n_Earthquake warning._—What has here been said respecting the prediction\r\nof earthquakes is necessarily imperfect—many of the signs which are\r\npopularly supposed to enable persons to foretell the coming of an\r\nearthquake having already been mentioned in previous chapters. That\r\nwe shall yet be able to prepare ourselves against the coming of\r\nearthquakes, by the applications of laws governing these disturbances,\r\nis not an unreasonable hope.\r\n\r\nWith an electric circuit which is closed by a movement of the ground,\r\nwe are already in a position to warn the dwellers in surrounding\r\ndistricts that a movement is approaching.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake which travelled at the rate of four seconds to the\r\nmile might, if it were allowed to close a circuit which fired a gun\r\nat a station fifteen miles distant, give the inhabitants at that\r\nplace a minute’s warning to leave their houses. The inhabitants of\r\nAustralia and the western shores of the Pacific might, by telegraphic\r\ncommunication, receive eighteen to twenty-five hours’ warning of the\r\ncoming of destructive sea waves resulting from earthquakes in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAlthough warnings like these might have their value, that which is\r\nchiefly required is to warn the dwellers at and near an earthquake\r\ncentre of coming disturbances.\r\n\r\nWhat the results of the observations on earth tremors will lead to is\r\nproblematical.\r\n\r\nShould microseismic observation enable us to say when and where the\r\nminute movements of the soil will reach a head, a valuable contribution\r\nto the insurance of human safety in earthquake regions will have been\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the movements of tromometers are destined to become\r\nbarometric-like warnings of increased activity beneath the earth\r\ncrust, or whether they are only due to vibrations of the earth\r\ncrust produced by variations in atmospheric pressure, has yet to be\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nOther phenomena which may probably forewarn us of the coming of an\r\nearthquake are phenomena resultant on the stresses brought to bear upon\r\nthe rocky crust previous to its fracture, or phenomena due to changes\r\nin the position and condition of heated materials beneath the earth’s\r\nsurface. Amongst these may be mentioned electrical disturbances, which\r\nappear to be so closely related to seismic phenomena.\r\n\r\nAt the time of earthquakes telegraph lines have been disturbed, but\r\nas to what may happen before an earthquake we have as yet but little\r\ninformation. The subject of earthquake warning is of importance to many\r\ncountries, and is deserving of attention.\r\n\r\nAs our knowledge of earth movements, and their attendant phenomena,\r\nincreases, there is but little doubt that laws will gradually be\r\nformulated, and in the future, as telluric disturbances increase, a\r\nlarge black ball gradually ascending a staff may warn the inhabitants\r\non the land of a coming earthquake, with as much certainty as the ball\r\nupon a pole at many seaports warns the mariner of coming storms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n                            EARTH TREMORS.\r\n\r\n  Artificially produced tremors—Observations of Kater, Denman,\r\n    Airy, Palmer, Paul—Natural tremors—Observations of Zöllner,\r\n    M. d’Abbadie, G. H. and H. Darwin—Experiments in Japan—With\r\n    seismoscopes, microphones, pendulums—Work in Italy—Bertelli,\r\n    Count Malvasia, M. S. di Rossi—Instruments employed in\r\n    Italy—Tromometers, microseismographs, microphones—Results\r\n    obtained in Italy—in Japan—Cause of microseismic motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years considerable attention has been drawn towards\r\nthe study of small vibratory motions of the ground, which to the\r\nunaided senses are usually passed by without recognition. These motions\r\nare called _earth tremors_. Their discovery appears to have been due\r\nto accident, and not to the results of inductive reasoning. No sooner\r\nhad philosophers contrived astronomical and other instruments for the\r\npurpose of making refined measurements and observations than they at\r\nonce discovered that they had an enemy to contend against in the form\r\nof microscopic earthquakes.\r\n\r\n_Artificially produced tremors._—Artificial disturbances of this\r\ndescription exist in all our towns, and near a railway line they are\r\nperceptible with every passing train. Those who have used microscopes\r\nof high power will readily appreciate how small a disturbance of\r\nthe ground is visible in the apparent movement of the object under\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nCaptain Kater found that he could not perform his pendulum experiments\r\nin London on account of the vibrations produced by the rolling of\r\ncarriages. Captain Denman, who made some observations on artificially\r\nproduced tremors, found that a goods train produced an effect 1,100\r\nfeet distant in marshy ground over sandstone. Vertically, however,\r\nabove a tunnel through the sandstone, the effects only extended 100\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA remarkable example of the trouble which artificially produced earth\r\nvibrations have occasioned those who make astronomical observations\r\noccurred some twenty years ago at the Greenwich Observatory. When\r\ndetermining the collimation error of the transit circle by means of the\r\nreflexion of a star in a tray of mercury, it was found that on certain\r\nnights the surface of the mercury was in such a state of trembling\r\nthat the observers were unable to complete their observations until\r\nlong after midnight. After obtaining a series of dates on which these\r\ndisturbances occurred, it was found that they coincided with public and\r\nbank holidays, on which days crowds of the poorer classes of London\r\nflocked to Greenwich Park, and there amused themselves with running and\r\nrolling down the hill on which the observatory is situated. On these\r\noccasions it was found that the disturbances in the mercury were such\r\nthat observations could not be made until two or three hours after the\r\ncrowds had been turned out of the neighbouring park.[137]\r\n\r\nTo obviate this difficulty Sir George Airy suspended his dish of\r\nmercury in a system of india-rubber bands, and in this way succeeded in\r\neating the intruders up.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel H. S. Palmer, R.E., when engaged with the transit of\r\nVenus expedition in New Zealand, in 1874, was troubled with vibrations\r\nproduced from a neighbouring railway. To escape the enemy he intrenched\r\nhis instruments by placing them in pits. With pits 3½ feet deep he\r\nfound himself sufficiently protected. The distance from the line was\r\nabout 400 yards, and the soil through which the disturbances were\r\npropagated was a coarse pebbly gravel.[138]\r\n\r\nBefore the United States Naval Observatory was established at\r\nWashington, Professor H. M. Paul was deputed to make a tremor survey\r\nto discover stable ground. The results of these experiments were\r\nexceedingly interesting. By watching the reflected image of a star in\r\na dish of mercury a passing train would be noticed at the distance of\r\na mile. Its approach could be detected by the trembling of the image\r\nbefore its coming could be heard. At one point of observation the\r\ndisturbance appeared to be cut off by a ravine. The strata was gravel\r\nand clay.[139]\r\n\r\nThese few examples of artificially produced tremors, to which many\r\nmore might be added, have been given because they teach us something\r\nrespecting their nature. Hitherto earth tremors have only been regarded\r\nas intruders, which it was necessary to escape from or destroy. From\r\nwhat has been said they appear to be a superficial disturbance which\r\nis propagated to an enormous distance. This distance appears to\r\ndepend upon the propagating medium, upon the intensity of the initial\r\ndisturbance, and upon its duration. In the observation of these\r\nartificial disturbances, which are accessible to every one, and which\r\nhitherto have been so neglected, we have undoubtedly a fruitful source\r\nof study.\r\n\r\n_Natural tremors._—Next let us turn to those microscopical\r\ndisturbances of our soil which are due to natural causes. Thus far they\r\nseem to have been recorded wherever instruments suitable for their\r\ndetection have been erected, and it is not improbable that they are\r\ncommon to the surface of the whole globe.\r\n\r\nSome of the more definite observations which have been made upon earth\r\ntremors were those made in connection with experiments on the deviation\r\nof the vertical due to the attractive influence of the moon and sun.\r\n\r\nProfessor Zöllner, who invented the horizontal pendulum which he used\r\nin the attempt to measure the change in level due to lunar and solar\r\nattraction, found his instruments so sensitive that the readings were\r\nalways changing.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting observations which were made upon small\r\ndisturbances of the soil were those of M. d’Abbadie, who carried on his\r\nexperiments at Abbadia, in Subernoa, near Hendaye, 400 mètres distant\r\nfrom the Atlantic, and 62 mètres above sea level. The soil was a loamy\r\nrock. Here M. d’Abbadie constructed a concrete cone 8 mètres in height,\r\nwhich was pierced down the centre by a vertical hole or well, which was\r\ncontinued two mètres below the cone into the solid rock. At the bottom\r\nof this hole or well a pool of mercury was formed which reflected\r\nthe image of cross wires placed at the top of the hole. These cross\r\nwires and their reflection were observed by means of a microscope.\r\nThe observations consisted in noting the displacement and azimuth of\r\nthe reflected image relatively to the real image of the wires. After\r\nallowing this structure five years to settle, M. d’Abbadie commenced\r\nhis observations. To find the surface of the mercury tranquil was\r\na rare occurrence. Sometimes the mercury appeared to be in violent\r\nmotion, although both the air and neighbouring sea were perfectly calm.\r\nAt times the reflected image would disappear as if the mercury had\r\nbeen disturbed by a microscopic earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of the images were in part governed by the state\r\nof the tide. Altogether the movements were so strange that M. d’Abbadie\r\ndid not venture any speculations as to their cause, but he remarks\r\nthat the cause of the changes he observed were sometimes neither\r\nastronomical nor thermometrical. These observations, the principal\r\nobject of which was to determine changes in level rather than earth\r\nvibrations, were carried on between the years 1868 and 1872.[140]\r\n\r\n_Observations at Cambridge._—Another instructive set of observations\r\nwere those which were made in the years 1880–1882, by George and Horace\r\nDarwin, in the Cavendish Laboratory, at Cambridge. The main object\r\nin these experiments was to determine the disturbing influence of\r\ngravity produced by lunar attraction. The result which was obtained,\r\nhowever, showed that the soil at Cambridge was in such an incessant\r\nstate of vibration that whatever pull the moon may have exerted upon\r\nthe instrument which was employed was masked by the magnitude of the\r\neffects produced by the earth tremors, and the experiments had, in\r\nconsequence, to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe principle of this instrument was similar to one devised by Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson, and put up by him in his laboratory at Glasgow.\r\nAs erected by the brothers Darwin, at Cambridge, it was briefly as\r\nfollows: A pendulum, which was a massive cylinder of pure copper,\r\nwas hung by a copper wire, about four feet long, inside a hollow\r\ncylindrical tube rising from a stone support. A small mirror was then\r\nhung by two silk fibres, one of which was fastened to the bob and the\r\nother to the stone basement. A ray of light sent from a lamp on to\r\nthe mirror was reflected to a scale seven feet distant, and by this\r\nmagnification any motion of the bob relatively to the stone support\r\nwas magnified 50,000 times. In several ways the apparatus was insulated\r\nfrom all accidental disturbances. The spot of light was observed from\r\nanother room by means of a telescope. This instrument was so delicate\r\nthat even at the distance of sixteen feet the shifting of your weight\r\nfrom one foot to the other caused the spot of light to run along the\r\nscale. So sensitive was the instrument that, notwithstanding its being\r\ncut off from the surrounding soil by a trench filled with water and\r\nthe whole instrument being immersed in water to damp out the small\r\nvibrations, it would seem that the ground was in a constant state of\r\ntremor; in fact, so persistent and irregular were these movements that\r\nit seemed impossible to separate them from the perturbations due to the\r\nattraction of the moon.[141]\r\n\r\nAs a result of observations like these, the world had gradually\r\nforced upon it the fact that the ground on which we live is probably\r\neverywhere in what is practically an incessant state of vibration.\r\n\r\nThis led those who were interested in the study of earth movements to\r\nestablish special apparatus for the purpose of recording these motions\r\nwith the hope of eventually discovering the laws by which they were\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\n_Experiments in Japan._—The simpler forms of apparatus which have been\r\nused in Japan may be described as delicate forms of seismoscopes,\r\nwhich, in addition to recording earth tremors, also record the\r\noccurrence of small earthquakes.\r\n\r\nA simple contrivance which may be used for the purpose of recording\r\nsmall earthquakes can be made with a small compass needle.\r\n\r\nIf a light, small sensitive compass needle be placed on a table, it\r\nwill be found that a small piece of iron like a nail may be pushed so\r\nnear to it that the needle assumes a position of extremely unstable\r\nequilibrium. If the table now receives the slightest tap or shake this\r\ncondition is overcome, and the needle flies to the iron and there\r\nremains. By making the support of the needle and the iron the poles of\r\nan electric circuit it is possible to register the time at which motion\r\ntook place with considerable accuracy.\r\n\r\nWith crude apparatus like this a large number of small earth\r\ndisturbances have been recorded.\r\n\r\nAnother form of apparatus, employed in Japan, has been a delicately\r\nconstructed _circuit closer_. The motions of this instrument were\r\nrecorded by causing an electro-magnet to deflect a pencil which was\r\ntracing a circle on a revolving dial. The revolving dial was a disc of\r\nwood covered with paper fixed to the hour-hand axle of a common clock.\r\n\r\nA third form of apparatus used in Japan consisted of a small piece of\r\nsheet lead about the size of a threepenny piece suspended by a short\r\nloop from a rigid support. Projecting from the lead a fine wire, about\r\ntwo inches in length, passed freely through a hole in a metallic plate.\r\nBy the slightest motion of the support the small pendulum of lead was\r\nset into a state of tremor and caused its pointer to come in contact\r\nwith one or other side of the hole in the metal plate and thus to close\r\nan electric circuit.\r\n\r\nA more refined kind of apparatus which has been employed in Japan was\r\nsimilar to that used by the Darwins at Cambridge. This was so arranged\r\nthat any deflection of the mirror was permanent until the instrument\r\nwas reset, and in this way the maximum disturbance which had taken\r\nplace between each observation was recorded.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these and other contrivances, experiments were made with\r\nmicrophones.\r\n\r\nThe microphones used were small doubly pointed pencils of carbon\r\nabout three centimetres long, saturated with mercury, and supported\r\nvertically in pivot holes bored in other pieces of carbon, which were\r\nthe terminals of an electric circuit. These microphones were screwed\r\ndown on the top of stakes driven deeply into the ground. They were\r\ncovered with a glass shade thickly greased at its base. The stakes were\r\nin the ground at the bottom of a small pit—about two feet square and\r\ntwo feet deep—which was lined with a box. The box was covered with a\r\nlid, and earth to the depth of nine inches or one foot. One of these\r\npits was in the middle of a lawn in the front of my house, and the\r\nother was at the foot of a hill at the back of the house. The wires\r\nfrom the microphone passed through the side of the box into a bamboo\r\ntube and thence up to my dining-room and bed-room. In one of the\r\ncircuits there were three Daniell’s cells, a telephone, and a small\r\ngalvanometer. I used the galvanometer because I found that when there\r\nwas sufficient motion in the microphone to produce a sound in the\r\ntelephone a motion in the needle of a galvanometer was produced. If in\r\nany case motion took place in the magnetic needle during my absence, it\r\nwas held deflected by a small piece of iron with which it was brought\r\ninto contact by the movement.\r\n\r\nThe sensitiveness of the arrangement may be judged of from the fact\r\nthat if a person walked on the grass within six feet of the microphone,\r\neach step caused a creak in the telephone, and the needle of the\r\ngalvanometer was caused to swing and come in contact with the iron.\r\nDogs running on the grass had no effect. A small stone one or two\r\ninches in diameter thrown from the house so that it fell near to the\r\nmicrophone pit caused a sharp creak in the telephone and a movement in\r\nthe needle.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the records I received from this contrivance may be\r\njudged of from the following extract from my papers.\r\n\r\n                  h. m.\r\n  1879. Nov. 12th 7  0 P.M. contact of needle\r\n                  7  2  „   difficult to set the needle\r\n                  7  3  „   needle swings and telephone creaks\r\n                  7  4  „         „           „           „\r\n                  7  5  „         „           „           „\r\n                  7  6  „         „           „           „\r\n                  7 10  „   3 more swings\r\n                  7 11  „   again    „\r\n\r\nHere I went out, took away the covering, and examined the microphone.\r\nNothing wrong was to be observed. All that I saw was one small ant. I\r\ndo not think that this could have caused the disturbance, because it\r\ncould not get near the instrument.\r\n\r\nOn the succeeding nights I experienced similar disturbances, and it\r\nseemed as if they might possibly have been the prelude to several small\r\nshocks which occurred about this time (November 15, 16, and 17). On\r\nNovember 17, at 8 A.M., the needle was found in contact, and again at\r\n5 P.M., and at 6 P.M. the shock of a small earthquake was felt _which\r\ncaused a rattling sound in the telephone for about one minute after the\r\nmotion had appeared to cease_. The needle swung considerably, but did\r\nnot come in contact.\r\n\r\nThe great objection to these observations is that it is possible\r\nthat the movements and sounds which I have recorded might, with the\r\nexception of one case when the shaking was actually felt, possibly have\r\nbeen produced by causes other than that of the movement of the ground.\r\nTo determine this I subsequently put up two distinct sets of apparatus\r\nto determine whether the motions of each were synchronous. So far as\r\nI went this appeared only to be sometimes the case:—but this is a\r\nquestion difficult to determine, unless a recorder of time be added to\r\nthe apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe greatest objection to observations of this sort is that the\r\nsensibility of the instrument is not constant. After a current has been\r\nrunning for several days it is no longer sensible to slight shocks, it\r\nappears as if its resistance had been increased. To overcome this it is\r\nnecessary to resharpen the carbon points and bore out the pivot holes\r\nevery three or four days. Farther, the battery varies. This might to\r\nsome extent be overcome by using a battery with large plates. These\r\ntwo causes tend to reduce the sensitiveness of the galvanometer-like\r\nrecorder—the deflection of the needle gradually becoming less and less,\r\nand therefore day by day needing a greater swing to bring it into\r\ncontact with the iron. For reasons such as these this instrument, to be\r\nused successfully, appears to require considerable attention.\r\n\r\nAnother form of microphone employed by the author consisted of an\r\naluminium wire standing vertically on a metallic plate, its upper end\r\npassing loosely through a hole in an aluminium wire standard.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the vertical wire was loaded with lead. This\r\ncontrivance possesses all the sensitiveness of an ordinary microphone,\r\nwhilst, if it receives a sudden impulse, there is a sudden break in the\r\ncurrent, and the vertical wire is thrown from one side to the other of\r\nthe hole in the standard.\r\n\r\nAfter many months of tiresome observation with instruments of this\r\ndescription, and after eliminating all motions which might have been\r\nproduced by accidental causes, the general result obtained showed that\r\nin Tokio there were movements of the soil to be detected every day,\r\nand sometimes many times per day, which to ordinary persons were passed\r\nby unnoticed.\r\n\r\n_Work in Italy._—The most satisfactory observations which have been\r\nmade upon microseismic disturbances are those which have been made\r\nduring the last ten years in Italy. The father of systematical\r\nmicroseismical research appears to have been Father Timoteo Bertelli,\r\nof Florence.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Father Bertelli suspended a pendulum in a cellar, and observed\r\nit with a microscope. As the result of his observations it was\r\nannounced that he had perceived the earthquakes which shook Romagna,\r\nalthough to the ordinary observer in Florence these shakings had not\r\nbeen perceptible.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 Bertelli, by means of microscopes fixed in several azimuths,\r\nmade 5,500 observations on free pendulums. He also made observations on\r\nreflections from the surface of mercury.[142]\r\n\r\nOne result of these observations was to show that microseismic motions\r\nincreased with a fall of the barometer. Similar observations were made\r\nat Bologna by M. le Conte Malvasia, and also by M. S. di Rossi, near\r\nRome. On January 14, 15, and February 25 these three observers at their\r\nrespective stations simultaneously observed great disturbances.\r\n\r\nSimilar investigations were made at Nice by M. le Baron Prost.\r\n\r\nAlthough doubt was cast upon Bertelli’s observations they appear to\r\nhave been the origin of a series of microseismical observations, a\r\ndistinguished leader in which is Professor Rossi, who, in 1874, found\r\nthat large earthquakes were almost always preceded or accompanied with\r\nmicroseismical storms. In 1878 Professor Rossi worked upon these small\r\ndisturbances with the assistance of the microphone and telephone, and\r\nhis first results were published by Professor Palmieri.\r\n\r\nMany of Professor Rossi’s observations were made in the grotto of Roca\r\nde Papa, 700 mètres high and eighteen mètres under the soil. Here over\r\n6,000 observations were made by means of microscopes, on pendulums of\r\ndifferent lengths, suspended in tubes cut in the solid rock.\r\n\r\n_Instruments employed in Italy._—It is impossible to describe in detail\r\nthe various forms of apparatus which have been used by the Italian\r\ninvestigators. A description of one or two of the more important\r\ninstruments may not, however, be out of place, inasmuch as they will\r\nassist the reader to understand the manner in which the various results\r\nrespecting the laws governing microseismic movements have been arrived\r\nat.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these instruments is the _Normal Tromometer_ of\r\nBertelli and Rossi.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a pendulum 1½ metres long, carrying, by means of\r\na very fine wire, a weight of 100 grammes. To the base of the bob\r\na vertical stile is attached, and the whole is enclosed in a tube\r\nterminated, at its base, by a glass prism of such a form that when\r\nlooked through horizontally the motion of the stile can be seen in\r\nall azimuths. In front of this prism a microscope is placed. Inside\r\nthe microscope there is a micromatic scale, so arranged that it can\r\nbe turned to coincide with the apparent direction of oscillation of\r\nthe point of the stile. In this way not only can the amplitude of the\r\nmotion of the stile be measured, but also its azimuth. The extent of\r\nvertical motion is measured by the up and down motion of the stile due\r\nto the elasticity of the supporting wire. This instrument is shown in\r\nthe accompanying drawing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.—Normal Tromometer.\r\n\r\nB, bob of pendulum; P, prism; M, microscope; S, rim of scale.]\r\n\r\nAnother apparatus is the _Microseismograph_ of Professor Rossi. Here we\r\nhave an arrangement which gives automatic records of slight motions.\r\nIt consists of four pendulums, each about three feet long, suspended\r\nso that they form the corners of a square platform. In the centre\r\nof this platform a fifth, but rather longer, pendulum is suspended.\r\nThe four pendulums are each connected just above their bobs to the\r\ncentral pendulum with loose silk threads. Fixed to the centre of each\r\nof these threads, and held vertically by a light spring, is a needle,\r\nso adjusted that each thread is depressed to form an obtuse angle of\r\nabout 155°. These needles form the terminals of an electric circuit,\r\nthe other termination of which is a small cup of mercury placed just\r\nbelow the lower end of the needle. By a horizontal swing of one of the\r\npendulums this arrangement causes the needle to move vertically, but\r\nwith a slightly multiplied amplitude. By this motion the needle comes\r\nin contact with the mercury, and an electro-magnet with a lever and\r\npencil is caused to make a mark on a band of paper moved by clockwork.\r\nThe five pendulums being of different lengths allows the apparatus to\r\nrespond ‘to seismic waves of different velocities.’[143]\r\n\r\nLastly, we have Professor Rossi’s _Microphone_. This consists of a\r\nmetallic swing arranged like the beam of a balance. By means of a\r\nmovable weight at one end of the beam this is so adjusted that it\r\nfalls down until it comes in contact with a metallic stop. This can be\r\nso adjusted that a slight tap will cause the beam to slightly jump from\r\nthe stop. The beam and the stop form two poles of an electric circuit,\r\nin which there is a telephone. The slightest motion in a _vertical_\r\ndirection causes a fluctuation in the current passing between the stop\r\nand the beam, and a consequent noise is heard in the telephone.\r\n\r\nWith instruments analogous to these, observations have been made by\r\nvarious observers in all portions of Italy, extending over a period\r\nof ten years. Every precaution appears to have been taken to avoid\r\naccidental disturbances, and the experiments have been repeated in a\r\nvariety of forms.\r\n\r\n_Results obtained in Italy._—The results which from time to time have\r\nbeen announced are of the greatest interest to those who study the\r\nphysics of the earth’s crust, and they appear to be leading to the\r\nestablishment of laws of scientific value.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the soil of Italy is in incessant movement, there\r\nbeing periods of excessive activity usually lasting about ten days.\r\nSuch periods are called seismic storms. These storms are separated by\r\nperiods of relative calm. These storms have their greater regularity\r\nin winter, and sharp maximums are to be observed in spring and autumn.\r\nIn the midst of such a period or at its end there is usually an\r\nearthquake. Usually these storms are closely related to barometric\r\ndepressions. To distinguish these movements from those which occur\r\nunder high pressure, the latter are called baro seismic movements, and\r\nthe former _vulcano seismic_ movements. The relation of these storms\r\nto barometric fluctuation has been observed to have been very marked\r\nduring the time of a volcanic eruption.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of a storm the motions are usually small, and one\r\nstorm, lasting two or three days, may be joined to another storm.\r\nIn such a case the action may be a local one. It has been observed\r\nthat a barometrical depression tended to bring a storm to a maximum,\r\nwhilst an increase of pressure would cause it to disappear. Sometimes\r\nthese actions are purely local, but at other times they may affect a\r\nconsiderable tract of land.\r\n\r\nIf a number of pendulums of different length are observed at the same\r\nplace, there is a general similarity in their movements, but it is also\r\nevident that the free period of the pendulum more or less disturbs\r\nthe character of the record. The greatest amplitude of motion in a\r\nset of pendulums is not reached simultaneously by all the pendulums,\r\nand at every disturbance the movement of one will predominate. From\r\nthis Rossi argues that the character of the microseismical motions is\r\nnot constant. Bertelli observed that the direction of oscillation of\r\nthe pendulums is different at different places, but each place will\r\nhave its particular direction dependent upon the direction of valleys\r\nand chains of mountains in the neighbourhood. Rossi shows that the\r\ndirections of movement are perpendicular to the direction of lines of\r\nfaults, the lips of these fractures rising and falling, and producing\r\ntwo sets of waves, one set parallel to the line of fracture, and the\r\nother perpendicular to such a direction. These movements, according\r\nto Bertelli, have no connection with the wind, rain, change of\r\ntemperature, and atmospheric electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\nThe disturbances, as recorded at different towns, are not always\r\nstrictly synchronous, but succeed each other at short intervals. If,\r\nhowever, we take monthly curves of the disturbances as recorded at\r\ndifferent towns in Italy, we see that these are similar in character.\r\nThe maximum of disturbance occurs about the winter solstice, and the\r\nminimum about the summer solstice, and in this respect they exhibit\r\na perfect accordance with the curves drawn by Mallet to show the\r\nperiodicity of earthquakes. The accompanying curves taken from one\r\nof Bertelli’s original memoirs not only show this general result but\r\nalso show the close accord there is between the results obtained at\r\ndifferent towns during successive months.\r\n\r\nAt Florence, before a period of earthquakes there is an increase in the\r\namplitude and frequency of vertical movements. These vertical movements\r\ndo not appear to coincide with the barometrical disturbances, but they\r\nappear to be connected with the seismic disturbances.\r\n\r\nThey are usually accompanied with noises in the telephone, but as the\r\nmicrophone is so constructed as to be more sensitive to vertical motion\r\nthan to horizontal motion, this is to be expected. This vertical motion\r\nwould appear to be a local action, inasmuch as the accompanying motions\r\nof an earthquake which originates at a distance are horizontal.\r\n\r\nStorms of microseismical motions appear to travel from point to point.\r\n\r\nSometimes a local earthquake is not noticed in the tromometer,\r\nwhilst one which occurred at a distance, although it may be small,\r\nis distinctly observed. To explain this, Bertelli suggests the\r\nexistence of nodes. Similar conclusions were arrived at by Rossi when\r\nexperimenting on different portions of the sides of Vesuvius. Galli\r\nnoticed an augmentation in microseismic activity when the sun and moon\r\nare near the meridian. Grablovitz found from Bertelli’s observations\r\na maximum two or three days before the syzygies, and a minimum\r\nthree days after these periods. He also found that the principal\r\nlarge disturbances occurred in the middle of periods separating\r\nthe quadrature from the syzygies, the apogee from perigee, and the\r\nlunistigi period from the nodes, whilst the smallest disturbances\r\nhappened in the middle of periods opposed to these.\r\n\r\nP. C. Melzi says that the curves of microseismical motions,\r\nearthquakes, lunar and solar motions, show a concordance with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWith the microphone Rossi hears sounds which he describes as roarings,\r\nexplosions, occurring isolated or in volleys, metallic and bell-like\r\nsounds, ticking, &c., which, he says, revealed natural telluric\r\nphenomena. Sometimes these have been intolerably loud. At Vesuvius the\r\nvertical shocks corresponded with a sound like volleys of musketry,\r\nwhilst the undulatory shocks gave the roaring. Some of these sounds\r\ncould be imitated artificially by rubbing together the conducting wires\r\nin the same manner in which the rocks must rub against each other in\r\nan earthquake. Other sounds were imitated by placing the microphone\r\non a vessel of boiling water, or by putting it on a marble slab and\r\nscratching and tapping the under side of it.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are some of the more important results which have been\r\narrived at by the study of microseismic motions. One point which seems\r\nworthy of attention is that they appear to be more law-abiding than\r\ntheir more violent relations, the earthquakes, and as phenomena in\r\nwhich natural laws are to be traced they are certainly deserving our\r\nattention. As to whether they will ever become the means of forewarning\r\nourselves against earthquakes is yet problematical. Their systematic\r\nstudy, however, will enable us to trace the progress of a microseismic\r\nstorm from point to point, and it is not impossible that we may yet\r\nbe enabled to foretell where the storm may reach its climax as an\r\nearthquake. These, I believe, are the views of Professor di Rossi, who\r\nis at the present time engaged in the establishment of a system of\r\nmicroseismic observations throughout Italy.\r\n\r\nBefore the earthquake of San Remo (Dec. 6, 1874) Rossi’s tromometer\r\nwas in a state of agitation, and similar disturbances were observed at\r\nLivorno, Florence, and Bologna.\r\n\r\nSince February 1883 I have observed a tromometer in Japan, and such\r\nresults as have been obtained accord with results obtained in Italy.\r\nThe increase in microseismical activity with a fall of the barometer\r\nis very marked. Other peculiarities in the behaviour of the instrument\r\nwill be referred to under ‘Earth Pulsations.’\r\n\r\n_Cause of microseismic movements._—As to the cause of tromometric\r\nmovements, we have a field for speculation. Possibly they may be\r\ndue to slight vibratory motions produced in the soil by the bending\r\nand crackling of rocks produced by their rise upon the relief of\r\natmospheric pressure. If this were so we should expect similar\r\nmovements to be produced at the time of an increase of pressure. Rossi\r\nsuggests that they may be the result of an increased escape of vapour\r\nfrom the molten materials beneath the crust of the earth, consequent\r\nupon a relief of pressure. The similarity of some of the sounds which\r\nare heard with the microphone to those produced by boiling water are\r\nsuggestive of this, and Rossi quotes instances when underground noises\r\nlike those which we should expect to hear from a boiling fluid have\r\nbeen heard before earthquakes without the aid of microphones. One\r\ninstance was that of Viduari, a prisoner in Lima, who, two days before\r\nthe shock of 1824, repeatedly predicted the same in consequence of the\r\nnoises he heard.\r\n\r\nA possible cause of disturbances of this order may be small but\r\nsudden fluctuations in barometric pressure, which are visible during\r\na storm. During a small typhoon on September 15, 1881, when in the\r\nKurile Islands, I observed that the needle of an aneroid worked back\r\nand forth with a period of from one to three seconds. This continued\r\nfor several hours. With every gust of wind the needle suddenly rose\r\nand then immediately fell. At times it trembled. These movements were\r\nobserved in the open air. The extent of these sudden variations\r\nwas approximately from ·03 to ·05 inches. Beckoning an increase of\r\nbarometrical pressure of one hundredth of an inch as equivalent to a\r\nload of twenty million pounds on the square mile, during this storm\r\nthere must have been the equivalent of loads of from 60 to 100 million\r\npounds to the square mile continually placed on and removed from a\r\nconsiderable tract of the earth’s surface. If the period of application\r\nof these stresses approximately coincide with the natural vibrational\r\nperiod of the area affected, it would surely seem, especially when\r\nwe reflect upon the effect of an ordinary carriage, that tremors of\r\nconsiderable magnitude ought to be produced.\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the following few observations taken from my note-book\r\nfor the same typhoon will suggest that even the large and slower\r\nvariations are capable of producing tremulous motions.\r\n\r\n                        Time           Barometer\r\n                        h.  m.          reading\r\n                        12  5 P.M.       29·02\r\n                        12 10  „         29·05\r\n                        12 12  „         29·07\r\n                        12 13  „         29·05\r\n                        12 25  „         29·10\r\n                        12 50  „         29·00\r\n                         1 10  „         29·00\r\n                         1 20  „         29·07\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                           EARTH PULSATIONS.\r\n\r\n  Definition of an earth pulsation—Indications of\r\n    pendulums—Indications of levels—Other phenomena indicating\r\n    the existence of earth pulsations—Disturbances in lakes and\r\n    oceans—Phenomena resultant on earth pulsations—Cause of earth\r\n    pulsations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the present chapter is to show that from time to time it\r\nis very probable that slow but large wave-like undulations travel over\r\nor disturb the surface of the globe.\r\n\r\nThese movements, which have escaped our attention on account of their\r\nslowness in period, for want of another term I call earth pulsations.\r\n\r\nThe existence of movements such as these may be indicated to us by\r\nchanges in the level of bodies of water like seas and lakes, by the\r\nmovements of delicate levels, by the displacement of the bob of a\r\npendulum relatively to some point on the earth above which it hangs,\r\nand by other phenomena which will be enumerated.\r\n\r\n_Indication of pendulums._—Pendulums which have been suspended for the\r\npurposes of seismometrical observations have, both by observers in\r\nItaly and Japan, been seen to have moved a short distance out from, and\r\nthen back to, their normal position.\r\n\r\nThis motion has simply taken place on one side of their central\r\nposition, and is not due to a swing. The character of these records\r\nis such that we might imagine the soil on which the support of the\r\npendulum had rested to have been slowly tilted, and slowly lowered.\r\nThey are the most marked on those pendulums provided with an index\r\nwriting a record of its motions on a smoked glass plate, which index is\r\nso arranged that it gives a multiplied representation of the relative\r\nmotion between it and the earth. As motions of this sort might be\r\npossibly due to the action of moisture in the soil tilting the support\r\nof the pendulum, and to a variety of other accidental causes, we cannot\r\ninsist on them as being certain indications that there are slow tips in\r\nthe soil, but for the present allow them to remain as possible proof of\r\nsuch phenomena.\r\n\r\nEvidence of displacement of the vertical, which are more definite than\r\nthe above, are those made by Bertelli, Rossi, Count Malvasia, and other\r\nItalian observers, who, whilst recording earth tremors, have spent so\r\nmuch time in watching the vibrations of stiles of delicate pendulums\r\nby means of microscopes. As a result of these observations we are\r\ntold that the point about which the stile of a pendulum oscillates\r\nis variable. These displacements take place in various azimuths, and\r\nthey appear to be connected with changes of the barometer. I have made\r\nsimilar observations in Japan.\r\n\r\nFrom this, and from the fact that it is found that a number of\r\ndifferent pendulums differently situated on the same area give similar\r\nevidence of these movements, it would hardly seem that these phenomena\r\ncould be attributed to causes like changes in temperature and moisture.\r\nM. S. di Rossi lays stress on this point, especially in connection with\r\nhis microseismograph, where there are a number of pendulums of unequal\r\nlength which give indications of a like character. The direction in\r\nwhich these tips of the soil take place—which phenomena are noticeable\r\nin seismic as well as microseismic motions—Rossi states are related to\r\nthe direction of certain lines of faulting.\r\n\r\n_Indications of levels._—Bubbles of delicate levels can be easily seen\r\nto change their position with meteorological variations; but Rossi also\r\ntells us that they change their position, sometimes not to return for\r\na long time, during a microseismic storm. Here again we have another\r\nphenomenon pointing to the fact that microseismic disturbances are the\r\ncompanions of slow alterations in level.\r\n\r\nOne of the most patient observers of levels has been M. Plantamour,\r\nwho commenced his observations in 1878, at Sécheron, on the Lake of\r\nGeneva. He used two levels, one placed north and south, and the other\r\neast and west. During the summer of 1878 the east end rose, but at the\r\nend of September a depression set in. The diurnal movements had their\r\nmaximum and minimum at 6 and 7.45 A.M. and P.M. The total amplitude was\r\n4·89″. The variations of the east and west level appeared to be due to\r\nthe temperature, but the movements of the north and south level were\r\ndependent upon an unknown cause.\r\n\r\nBetween October 1, 1879, and September 30, 1880, the east end fell\r\nrapidly, from the middle of November up to December 26, amounting to\r\n88·71″. It then rose 6·55″ to January 5, and then fell again. On\r\nJanuary 28 it reached 89·95″, after which it rose.\r\n\r\nBetween October 4, 1879, and January 28, 1880, the movement was 95·8″,\r\nagainst 28·08″ of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThese movements were not due alone to temperature. The north and south\r\nlevel, which was not influenced by the cold of the winter, moved\r\n4·56″. In the previous year 4·89″.[144]\r\n\r\nFrom February 17 to June 5, 1883, the author observed in Tokio the\r\nbubbles of two delicate levels, one placed north and south, and the\r\nother east and west. They were placed under glass cases on the head of\r\na stone column. The column, which is inside a brick building, rests\r\non a concrete foundation, and is about ten years old. It is in no way\r\nconnected with the building. The temperature of the room has a daily\r\nvariation of about 1° Fahr.\r\n\r\nIn both these levels diurnal changes are very marked. Occasionally they\r\nare enormously great. Thus, on March 25, the readings of the south end\r\nof the north south level were as follows:—\r\n\r\n                            Time           Readings.\r\n                            h. m.\r\n                      25th. 4 00 P.M.       104·5\r\n                            4  5  „         103\r\n                            4 10  „         102\r\n                            4 25  „         101\r\n                            4 30  „         100\r\n                            4 40  „          98\r\n                            4 42  „          99·5\r\n                            4 45  „         100\r\n                            4 50  „         101\r\n                            4 55  „         101\r\n                            5 00  „         100\r\n                      26th. 7 00 A.M.       105\r\n\r\nUsually this level moves through about three divisions per day.\r\n\r\nFrom March 25 to May 4 it travelled from 98 to 127. Since then, to June\r\n5, it has descended to 116. During this period the east west level\r\nhas been _comparatively_ quiet. One division of the north south level\r\nequals about 2″ of arc.\r\n\r\nMany of these changes may be due to changes in temperature, variations\r\nin moisture, and other local actions. Some of them, however, are hardly\r\nexplicable on such assumptions. The fact that the general direction in\r\nchange of the vertical, as indicated by a tromometer standing on the\r\nsame column with the levels, showed that the change which was taking\r\nplace was rather in the column than in the instruments.\r\n\r\nThe fact also that at the time of a barometrical depression a\r\n_pulse-like surge_ can be seen in the levels, having a period averaging\r\nabout three seconds and sometimes amounting to about one second of\r\narc, is a phenomenon hardly to be attributed to sudden fluctuations in\r\nmoisture or temperature, but indicates real changes in level.[145]\r\n\r\nIn addition to variation in the bubbles of levels which come on more or\r\nless gradually, we have many recorded instances of _sudden_ alterations\r\ntaking place in these instruments.\r\n\r\nExamples of what may have been a slow oscillating motion of the earth’s\r\ncrust are referred to by Mr. George Darwin in a Report to the British\r\nAssociation in 1882.\r\n\r\nOne of them was made by M. Magnus Nyrén, at Pulkova, who, when engaged\r\nin levelling the axis of a telescope, observed spontaneous oscillation\r\nin the bulb of the level.\r\n\r\nThis was on May 10 (April 28), 1877. The complete period was about\r\n20 seconds, the amplitude being 1·5″ and 2″. One hour and fourteen\r\nminutes before this he observes that there had been a severe earthquake\r\nat Iquique, the distance to which in a straight line was 10,600\r\nkilomètres, and on an arc of a great circle, 12,500 kilomètres.\r\nOn September 20 (8), in 1867, Mr. Wagner had observed at Pulkova\r\noscillations of 3″, seven minutes before which there had been an\r\nearthquake at Malta. On April 4 (March 23), 1868, an agitation of the\r\nlevel had been observed by Mr. Gromadzki, five minutes before which\r\nthere had been an earthquake in Turkestan. Similar observations had\r\nbeen made twice before. These, however, had not been connected with any\r\nearthquakes—at least, Mr. Darwin remarks—with certainty.\r\n\r\n_Phenomena analogous to the pendulum and level observations._—As\r\nexamples of phenomena which are analogous to those made on pendulums\r\nand levels, the following may be noticed. On March 20, 1881, at 9 P.M.\r\na watchmaker in Buenos Ayres observed that all his clocks oscillating\r\nnorth and south suddenly began to increase their amplitude, until some\r\nof them became twice as great as before. Similar observations were\r\nmade in all the other shops. No motion of the earth was detected.\r\nSubsequently it was learnt that this corresponded with an earthquake in\r\nSantiago and Mendoza.[146]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable example illustrating the like phenomena is furnished\r\nby the observations which were made on December 21, 1860, by means of a\r\nbarometer in San Francisco, which oscillated, with periods of rest, for\r\nhalf an hour. No shock was felt, nor is it likely that it was a local\r\naccident, as it could not be produced artificially. On the following\r\nday, however, a violent earthquake was experienced at Santiago.[147]\r\n\r\nAt the time or shortly after the great Lisbon earthquake, curious\r\nphenomena were observed in distant countries, which only appear to be\r\nexplicable on the assumption of the existence of earth pulsations.\r\n\r\nThus at Amsterdam and other towns, chandeliers in churches were\r\nobserved to swing. At Haarlem water was thrown over the sides of tubs,\r\nand it is expressly mentioned that no motion was perceived in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAt the Hague a tallow chandler was surprised at the clashing noise\r\nmade by his candles, and this the more so because no motion was felt\r\nunderfoot.\r\n\r\n_Unusual disturbances in bodies of water._—At the time of large\r\nearthquakes it would appear that earth pulsations are produced, which\r\nexhibit themselves in countries where the actual shaking of the\r\nearthquake is not felt, by disturbances in bodies of waters like lakes\r\nand seas.\r\n\r\nSome remarkable examples of these disturbances are to be found in the\r\nrecords of the great Lisbon earthquake. This earthquake, as a violent\r\nmovement of the ground, was chiefly felt in Spain, Portugal, northern\r\nItaly, the south of France and Germany, northern Africa, Madeira, and\r\nother Atlantic islands. In other countries further distant, as, for\r\ninstance, Great Britain, Holland, Scandinavia, and North America,\r\nalthough the records are numerous, the only phenomena which were\r\nparticularly observed was the slow oscillations of the waters in lakes,\r\nponds, canals, &c. In some instances the observers especially remark\r\nthat there was no motion in the soil.\r\n\r\nPebley Dam, in Derbyshire, which is a large body of water covering\r\nsome thirty acres, commenced to oscillate from the south. A canal near\r\nGodalming flowed eight feet over the walk on the north side.\r\n\r\nConiston Water, in Cumberland, which is about five miles long,\r\noscillated for about five minutes, rising a yard up its shores. Near\r\nDurham a pond, forty yards long and ten broad, rose and fell about one\r\nfoot for six or seven minutes. There were four or five ebbs and flows\r\nper minute.\r\n\r\nLoch Lomond rose and fell through about two and a half feet every\r\nfive minutes, and all the other lochs in Scotland seem to have been\r\nsimilarly agitated.\r\n\r\nAt Shirbrun Castle, in Oxfordshire, where the water in some moats and\r\nponds was very carefully observed, it was noticed that the floods\r\nbegan gently, the velocity then increased, till at last with great\r\nimpetuosity they reached their full height. Here the water remained for\r\na little while, until the ebb commenced, at first gently, but finally\r\nwith great rapidity. At two extremities of a moat about 100 yards long,\r\nit was found that the sinkings and risings were almost simultaneous.\r\nThe motions in a pond a short distance from the moat were also\r\nobserved, and it was found that the risings and sinkings of the two did\r\nnot agree.\r\n\r\nDuring these motions there were several maxima.\r\n\r\nThese few examples of the motions of waters, without any record of the\r\nmotions of the ground, at the time of the Lisbon earthquake, must be\r\ntaken as examples of a very large number of similar observations of\r\nwhich we have detailed accounts.\r\n\r\nLike agitations, it must also be remembered, were perceived in North\r\nAmerica and in Scandinavia, and if the lakes of other distant countries\r\nhad been provided with sufficiently delicate apparatus, it is not\r\nunlikely that similar disturbances would have been recorded.\r\n\r\nBesides these movements in the waters of seas and lakes, at or about\r\nthe time of great earthquakes, we have records of like movements, which\r\ntake place as independent phenomena.\r\n\r\nThus we read that on October 22, 1755, the waters of Lake Ontario rose\r\nand fell five and a half feet several times in the course of half an\r\nhour.[148] On March 31, 1761, Loch Ness rose suddenly for the period\r\nof three-quarters of an hour.[149]\r\n\r\nAs another example of the disturbance of water at the time of a great\r\nearthquake in districts where the earthquake was not felt, may be\r\nmentioned the swelling of the waters of the Marañon, in 1746, on the\r\nnight when Callao was overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nSudden variations in the level of the water have been many times\r\nobserved in the North American lakes. The changes in level which\r\nsometimes take place in the Genfer and Boden lakes are supposed to have\r\nsome relation to the condition of the atmosphere. A rising and falling\r\nof especial note took place on April 18, 1855.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland these sudden changes are known as ‘seiches’ or ‘rhussen.’\r\n\r\nFrom the observations and calculations of Prof. Forel it would seem\r\nthat the period of the ‘seiches’ depends upon the dimensions of the\r\nlakes; the calculated periods dependent on the depths of the lakes\r\nbeing approximately equal to the observed periods.[150]\r\n\r\nW. T. Bingham, writing on the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nremarks that it is not unusual for the sea to be agitated by great and\r\nunusual tides, and that such sea waves have not been attended with\r\nvolcanic eruptions or seismic disturbances. Thus in May 1819 the tide\r\nrose and fell thirteen times. On November 7, 1837, there was an ebb and\r\nflow of eight feet every twenty-eight minutes. Again, on May 17, 1841,\r\nlike phenomena, unaccompanied by any other unusual occurrences, were\r\nrecorded.[151]\r\n\r\nPhenomena which may possibly hold a relationship to earth pulsations\r\nare the periodical swellings of the ocean on the coast of Peru. Dr. C.\r\nF. Winslow, who made a long period observation upon the coast of Peru,\r\nfound ‘the highest tides to prevail at Callao and Paita in December\r\nand January,’ and ‘also a series of enormous waves or sea-swells to\r\nbe thrown from time to time upon the coast, varying from twenty-four\r\nto twenty-seven hours in continuance, accompanied by unusual height\r\nof the tide during the same period.’ During June and July the ocean\r\nwas unusually tranquil. These phenomena do not appear to be connected\r\nwith great atmospheric storms, nor do they hold any relation to the\r\nprevailing wind. They increase with and accompany the swelling of the\r\ntides, and occur generally, but not always, about full moon.\r\n\r\nSometimes they break suddenly upon the coast. ‘_They are annual and\r\nconstant in their periodicity._’\r\n\r\nThe periodical swellings are most noticeable between Tumbez 3° S.L. and\r\nthe Chincha Islands 14° S.L.\r\n\r\nThese oceanic phenomena synchronise with the periodic intensity of\r\nearthquake phenomena in that part of the globe, and these with tidal\r\nmovements.[152]\r\n\r\n_Other phenomena possibly attributable to earth pulsations._—If we\r\nassume that earth pulsations have an existence, these many phenomena\r\nwhich are otherwise difficult to understand meet with an explanation.\r\nThe curious effects which were produced in the springs at Toplitz at\r\nthe time of the Lisbon earthquake may have been due to a pulse-like\r\nwave. The flow of the principal spring was greatly increased. Before\r\nthe increase it became turbid and at one time stopped. Subsequently it\r\nbecame clear and flowed as usual, but the water was hotter and more\r\nstrongly mineralised. Sudden changes in the flow of underground waters\r\nwhich from time to time are observed may be attributed to like causes.\r\nSecondary earthquakes such as occurred after the Lisbon earthquake,\r\nas for instance in Derbyshire, may have been produced by pulsations\r\ndisturbing the equilibrium of ground in a critical state.\r\n\r\nThe falling in of subterranean excavations is also possibly connected\r\nwith these phenomena.\r\n\r\n_Possible causes of earth pulsations._—Mr. George Darwin, in a report\r\nto the British Association (1882), has shown that movements of\r\nconsiderable magnitude may occur in the earth’s crust in consequence of\r\nfluctuations in barometrical pressure. (A rise of the barometer over an\r\narea is equivalent to loading that area with a weight, in consequence\r\nof which it is depressed. When the barometer falls, the load is removed\r\nfrom the area, which, in virtue of its elasticity, rises to its\r\noriginal position. This fall and rise of the ground completes a single\r\npulsation.)\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that the earth has a rigidity like steel, Mr. Darwin\r\ncalculates that if the barometer rises an inch over an area like\r\nAustralia, the load is sufficient to sink that continent two or three\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThe tides which twice a day load our shores cause the land to rise and\r\nfall in a similar manner. On the shores of the Atlantic, Mr. Darwin\r\nhas calculated that this rise and fall of the land may be as much as 5\r\ninches. By these risings and fallings of the land the inclination of\r\nthe surface is so altered that the stile of a plummet suspended from a\r\nrigid support ought not always to hang over the same spot. There would\r\nbe a deflection of the vertical.\r\n\r\nIn short, calculations respecting the effects of loads of various\r\ndescriptions, which we know are by natural operations continually\r\nbeing placed upon and removed from the surface of various areas of the\r\nearth’s surface, indicate that slow pulsatory movements of the earth’s\r\nsurface must be taking place, causing variations in inclination of one\r\nportion of the earth’s crust relatively to another.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is possible that phenomena like the surging of levels may\r\nbe attributable to causes like these, we can hardly attribute the other\r\nphenomena to such agencies.\r\n\r\nRather than seek an explanation from agencies exogenous to our earth,\r\nwe might perhaps with advantage appeal to the endogenous phenomena of\r\nour planet. When the barometer falls, which we have shown corresponds\r\nto an upward motion of the earth’s crust, we know, from the results of\r\nexperiments, that microseismic motions are particularly noticeable.\r\n\r\nAs a pictorial illustration of what this really means, we may imagine\r\nourselves to be residing on the loosely fitting lid of a large\r\ncauldron, the relief of the external pressure over which increases the\r\nactivity of its internal ebullition—the jars attendant on which are\r\ngradually propagated from their endogenous source to the exterior of\r\nour planet. This travelling outwards would take place much in the same\r\nway that the vibrations consequent to the rattle and jar of a large\r\nfactory slowly spread themselves farther and farther from the point\r\nwhere they were produced.\r\n\r\nAdmitting an action of this description to take place, it would then\r\nfollow that this extra liberation of gaseous material beneath the\r\nearth’s crust would result in an increased upward pressure from within,\r\nand a tendency on the part of the earth’s crust to elevation. If we\r\naccept this as an explanation of the increased activity of a tremor\r\nindicator, then such an instrument may be regarded as a barometer,\r\nmeasuring by its motions the variations in the internal pressure of our\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nThe relief of external pressure and the increase of internal pressure,\r\nit will be observed, both tend in the same direction—namely, to an\r\nelevation of the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the increased activity of earth tremors, which\r\nhas also been suggested by M. S. di Rossi, is here only advanced as a\r\nspeculation, more probable perhaps than many others.\r\n\r\nWe know how a mass of sulphur which has been fused in the presence of\r\nwater in a closed boiler gives up in the form of steam the occluded\r\nmoisture upon the relief of pressure. In a similar manner we see steam\r\nescaping from volcanic vents and cooling streams of lava. We also\r\nknow how gas escapes from the pores and cavities in a seam of coal\r\non the fall of the barometrical column. We also know that certain\r\nwells increase the height of their column under like conditions. The\r\nlatter of these phenomena, resulting in an increase in the rate of\r\ndrainage of an area by its tendency to render such an area of less\r\nweight, facilitates its rise. If we follow the views of Mr. Mallet in\r\nconsidering that the pressures exerted on the crust of our earth may in\r\nvolcanic regions be roughly estimated by the height of a column of lava\r\nin the volcanoes of such districts, we see that in the neighbourhood of\r\na volcano like Cotopaxi the upward pressures must be enormously great.\r\nFurther, the phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes indicate that these\r\npressures are variable. Before a volcano bursts forth we should expect\r\nthat there would be in its vicinity an upward bulging of the crust, and\r\nafter its formation a fall. Further, it is not difficult to conjecture\r\nother possible means by which such pressures may obtain relief.\r\n\r\nShould these pressures then find relief without rupturing the\r\nsurface, it is not difficult to imagine them as the originators of\r\nvast pulsations which may be recorded on the surface of the earth as\r\nwave-like motions of slow period.\r\n\r\nAs an explanation of the strange movements observed on seas and lakes,\r\nKluge brings forward the following strange and remarkable theory. The\r\noxygen of the air is magnetic, whilst water is diamagnetic and the\r\nearth magnetic: we have, therefore, in our seas and lakes a diamagnetic\r\nbody lying between and being, consequently, repelled from two magnetic\r\nbodies. By variation in temperature, the balance of repulsions\r\nexerted by the air and the earth is destroyed. Thus, by an elevation\r\nof temperature the air expands and flows away from the heated area,\r\nwhere, in consequence, there is less oxygen. The result of this is,\r\nthat the repulsion of the air upon the waters is less than that of the\r\nearth upon the waters, and the waters are in consequence raised up. By\r\na falling of temperature the waters may be depressed, and by either\r\nof these actions waves may be produced without the intervention of\r\nearthquakes or earth pulsations.\r\n\r\nThe more definite kinds of information which we have to bring forward,\r\ntending to prove the existence of earth pulsations, too slow in period\r\nto be experienced by ordinary observers, are those which appear to be\r\nresultant phenomena of great earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena that we are certain of in connection with earth\r\nvibrations, whether these vibrations are produced artificially by\r\nexplosions of dynamite in bore-holes, or whether they are produced\r\nnaturally by earthquakes, are, first, that a disturbance as it dies out\r\nat a given point often shows in the diagrams obtained by seismographs a\r\ndecrease in period; and, secondly, a similar decrease in the period of\r\nthe disturbance takes place as the disturbance spreads.\r\n\r\nAs examples of these actions I will quote the following.\r\n\r\nThe diagram of the disturbance of March 1, 1882, taken at Yokohama,\r\nshows that the vibrations at the commencement of the disturbance had a\r\nperiod of about three per second, near the middle of the disturbance\r\nthe period is about 1·1, whilst near the end the period has decreased\r\nto ·46. That is to say, the backward and forward motion of the ground\r\nat the commencement of the earthquake was six times as great as it was\r\nnear the end, when to make one complete oscillation it took between two\r\nand three seconds. Probably the period became still less, but was not\r\nrecorded owing to the insensibility of the instruments to such slow\r\nmotions.[153]\r\n\r\nWe have not yet the means of comparing together diagrams of two or more\r\nearthquakes, one having been taken near to the origin, and the other\r\nat a distance. The only comparisons which I have been enabled to make\r\nhave been those of diagrams taken of the same earthquake, one in Tokio\r\nand the other in Yokohama. As this base is only sixteen miles, and the\r\nearthquake may have originated at a distance of several hundreds of\r\nmiles, comparisons like these can be of but little value.\r\n\r\nOther diagrams illustrating the same point are those obtained at three\r\nstations in a straight line, but at different distances from the\r\norigin of a disturbance produced by exploding a charge of dynamite in\r\na bore-hole. A simple inspection of these diagrams shows that at the\r\nnear station the disturbance consisted of backward and forward motions,\r\nwhich, as compared with the same disturbance as recorded at a more\r\ndistant station, were very rapid. Further, by examining the diagram\r\nof the motions, say, at the near station, it is clearly evident that\r\nthe period of the backward and forward motion rapidly decreased as the\r\nmotion died out.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations are given as examples out of a large series of\r\nother records, all showing like results.\r\n\r\nAn observation which confirms the records obtained from seismographs\r\nrespecting the increase in period of an earthquake as it dies out\r\nI have had opportunities of twice making with my levels. After all\r\nperceptible motion of the ground subsequent upon a moderately severe\r\nshock had died away, I have distinctly seen the bubble in one of these\r\nlevels slowly pulsating with an irregular period of from one to five\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nAlthough we must draw a distinction between earth waves and water\r\nwaves, we yet see that in these points they present a striking\r\nlikeness. Let us take, for example, any of the large earthquake waves\r\nwhich have originated off the coast of South America, and then radiated\r\noutwards, until they spread across the Pacific, to be recorded in Japan\r\nand other countries perhaps twenty-five hours afterwards, at a distance\r\nof nearly 9,000 miles from their origin. Near this origin they appeared\r\nas walls of water which were seen rapidly advancing towards the coast.\r\nThese have been from twenty to two hundred feet in height, and they\r\nsucceeded each other at rapid intervals, until finally they died out as\r\na series of gentle waves. By the time these walls of water traversed\r\nthe Pacific, to, let us say, Japan, they broadened out to a swell so\r\nflat that it could not be detected on the smoothest water excepting\r\nalong shore lines where the water rose and fell like the tide. Instead\r\nof a wall of water sixty feet in height, we had long flat undulations\r\nperhaps eight feet in height, but with a distance from crest to crest\r\nof from one to two hundred miles.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the effects of large earthquakes as exhibited on the\r\nland, I think that we shall find records of phenomena which are only\r\nto be explained on the assumption of an action having taken place\r\nanalogous to that which takes place so often in the ocean, or an action\r\nsimilar to that exhibited by small earthquakes, and artificially\r\nproduced disturbances, if greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation for the phenomena accompanying the Lisbon\r\nearthquake appears to be that the short quick vibrations which had\r\nruined so many cities in Portugal had, by the time that they had\r\nradiated to distant countries, gradually become changed into long flat\r\nwaves having a period of perhaps several minutes. In countries like\r\nEngland these pulse-like movements were too gentle to be perceived,\r\nexcept in the effects produced by tipping up the beds of lakes and\r\nponds.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon was not unlike that of a swell produced by a distant\r\nstorm. It would seem possible that in some cases pulsations producing\r\nphenomena like the ‘seiches’ of Switzerland might have their origin\r\nbeneath the ocean, or deep down beneath the earth’s crust. Perhaps,\r\ninstead of commencing with the ‘snap and jar’ of an earthquake, they\r\nmay commence as a heaving or sinking of a considerable area, which\r\nmay be regarded as an uncompleted effort in the establishment of an\r\nearthquake or a volcano.\r\n\r\nFrom what has now been said it would seem that earth pulsations\r\nare phenomena with a real existence, and that some of these are\r\nattributable to earthquakes. On the other hand, certain earthquakes\r\nare attributable to earth pulsations. Some of the phenomena which\r\nhave been brought forward have only a possible connection with these\r\nmovements, and they yet require investigation. Elastic tides in the\r\nearth’s crust have for long been realities in the minds of physicists.\r\nThese, however, are due to lunar and solar influences, and are regular\r\nin their action. The tidal-like movements called pulsations are of\r\ngreater magnitude, and their goings and comings are irregular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                          EARTH OSCILLATIONS.\r\n\r\n  Evidences of oscillation—Examples of oscillation—Temple of Jupiter\r\n    Serapis—Observations of Darwin—Causes of oscillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evidences of oscillation._—By earth oscillations are meant those slow\r\nand quiet changes in the relative level of the sea and land which\r\ngeologists speak of as elevations or subsidences. These movements are\r\nespecially characteristic of volcanic and earthquake-shaken countries.\r\n\r\nAs evidences of elevations we appeal to phenomena like raised beaches,\r\nsea-worn caves, raised coral reefs, and the remains of other dead\r\norganisms like barnacles, and the borings of lithodomous shells in and\r\non the rocks of many coasts high above the level of the highest tides.\r\nAs a proof that subsidence has taken place, there is the evidence\r\nafforded by submerged forests, the prolongation of certain valleys\r\nbeneath the bed of the ocean, the formation of coral islands, the\r\npeculiar distribution of the plants and animals which we find in many\r\ncountries, and the submergence of works of human construction. Inasmuch\r\nas these phenomena are discussed so fully in many treatises on physical\r\ngeology, the references to them here will be made as brief as possible.\r\nElevations and depressions which have taken place at the time of large\r\nearthquakes in a paroxysmal manner have already been mentioned. The\r\nmovements referred to in this chapter, although generally taking place\r\nwith extreme slowness, in certain instances, by an increase in their\r\nrapidity, have approached in character to earth pulsations. In most\r\ninstances it would appear that the upward movement of the ground, which\r\nmay be likened to a process of tumefaction, goes on so gently that it\r\nonly becomes appreciable after the lapse of many generations.\r\n\r\n_Examples of movements._—Lyell estimated that the average rate of rise\r\nin Scandinavia has been about two and a half feet per century. At the\r\nNorth Cape the rise may have been as much as five or six feet per\r\ncentury. Observations made at the temple of Jupiter Serapis, between\r\nOctober 1822 and July 1838, showed that the ground was sinking at the\r\nrate of about one inch in four years. Since the Roman period, when this\r\ntemple was built, the ground has sunk twenty feet below the waves. Now\r\nthe floor of the temple is on the level of the sea. Lyell remarks that\r\nif we reflect on the dates of the principal oscillations at this place\r\nthere appears to be connection between the movements of upheaval and a\r\nlocal development of volcanic heat, whilst periods of depression are\r\nconcurrent with periods of volcanic quiescence.[154]\r\n\r\nAs examples of movements even more rapid than those at the Temple of\r\nJupiter Serapis we refer to an account of the earthquakes in Vallais\r\n(November 1755), when the ground about a mountain at a small distance\r\nfrom Brigue sank about a thumb’s-breadth every twenty-four hours. This\r\ntook place between December 9 and February 26.[155]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable example of earth movement is given in the account\r\nof the earthquake at Scarborough, on December 29, 1737, when the head\r\nof the spa water well was forced up in the air about ten yards high. At\r\nthis time the sands on the shore are said to have risen so slowly that\r\npeople came out to watch them.[156]\r\n\r\nTwo other examples of rapid earth movement are taken from Professor\r\nRossi’s ‘Meteorologia Endogena.’ Professor D. Seghetti, writing to\r\nProfessor Rossi, says that a few lustres ago (one lustre = twenty\r\nyears) Mount S. Giovanni hid the towns Jenne and Subiaco from each\r\nother. From Subiaco the church at Jenne is now visible, which a few\r\nyears ago was invisible. The people at Jenne also can see more than\r\nformerly. The supposition is that the side of Mount S. Giovanni is\r\nlowered. This fact corresponds to a fact stated by Professor Carina,\r\nwho says that forty or fifty years ago from Granaiola you could not see\r\neither the church of S. Maria Assunta di Citrone or the church of S.\r\nPietro di Corsena. Now you can see both.[157]\r\n\r\nFor a remarkable example illustrating the connection between seismic\r\nactivity and elevation we are indebted to the patient labours of\r\nDarwin, who carefully investigated the evidences of elevation which\r\nare visible upon the western coasts of South America. These evidences,\r\nconsisting of marks of erosion, caves, ancient beaches, sand dunes,\r\nterraces of gravel, &c., were traced between latitudes 45° 35′ to 12°\r\n5′, a distance north and south of 2,075 geographical miles, and there\r\nis but little doubt that they extend much farther. As deduced from\r\nobservations upon upraised shells alone, a summary of Mr. Darwin’s\r\nobservations are contained in the following table:—\r\n\r\n                                                    Feet\r\n  At Chiloe the recent elevation has been            350\r\n  „  Concepcion            „         „      625 to 1,000\r\n  „  Valparaiso            „         „             1,300\r\n  „  Coquimbo              „         „               252\r\n  „  Lima                  „         „                85\r\n\r\nShells, similar to those clinging to uplifted rocks, which are\r\nevidences of these elevations, still exist in the neighbouring seas,\r\nand in the same proportionate numbers as they are found in the upraised\r\nbeds. In addition to this, Mr. Darwin shows us that at Lima, during the\r\nIndo-human period, the elevation has been at least eighty-five feet.\r\nAt Valparaiso, during the last 220 years, the rise was about nineteen\r\nfeet, and in the seventeen years subsequent to 1817 the rise has been\r\nten or eleven feet, a portion only of which can be attributed to\r\nearthquakes. In 1834 the rise there was apparently still in progress.\r\n\r\nAt Chiloe there has been a gradual elevation of about four feet in four\r\nyears. These, together with numerous other examples, testify to the\r\ngradual but, as compared with other parts of the globe, exceedingly\r\nrapid rise of the ground upon the western shores of South America.[158]\r\nThe most important point to be noticed is that this district of rapid\r\nelevation is one of the most earthquake-shaken regions of the world.\r\nAnd further, judging from Darwin’s remarks, in those portions of it\r\nwhere the movements have been the most extensive, and at the same time\r\nprobably the most rapid, the seismic disturbances appear to have been\r\nthe most noticeable.\r\n\r\nSimilar remarks may be applied to Japan, it being in those districts\r\nwhere evidences of recent elevation are abundant that earthquakes\r\nare numerous. Thus, in the bay of Yedo, where we have borings of\r\nlithodomi in the tufaceous cliffs ten feet above high-water mark,\r\nwhich, inasmuch as the rock in which they are found is soft and easily\r\nweathered, indicate an exceedingly rapid elevation, earthquakes are of\r\ncommon occurrence.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidences of elevation which we have upon the South American\r\ncoast, Japan, and in other countries, it appears that these movements\r\nare intermittent, there being periods of rest, when sea cliffs are\r\ndenuded, and perhaps even periods of subsidence. There is also evidence\r\nto show that, although these movements have been gradual from time to\r\ntime, they have been aided by starts occasioned by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nAs to whether earthquakes are more numerous during periods of\r\nelevation, or of subsidence, or during the intermediate periods of\r\nrest, we have no evidence.\r\n\r\nSudden displacements which occasionally accompany earthquakes might, it\r\nwas said, sometimes be regarded as the _cause_ of an earthquake, and\r\nsometimes as the _effect_.\r\n\r\nThe slow elevations here referred to may be looked upon as being one of\r\nthe more important factors in the production of earthquakes. By various\r\ncauses the rocky coast is bent until, having reached the limit of its\r\nelasticity, it snaps, and, in flying back like a broken spring, causes\r\nthe jars and tremors of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, then the number of earthquakes felt in a district\r\nwhich is being elevated may possibly be a function of the rate of\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n      LIST OF THE PRINCIPAL BOOKS, PAPERS, PERIODICALS, WHICH ARE\r\n                  REFERRED TO IN THE PRECEDING PAGES.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n  _For a more complete bibliography of earthquakes refer to Mallet’s\r\n      catalogue of works given in his report to the British Association\r\n      in 1858._\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n  A True and Particular Relation of the Dreadful Earthquake which\r\n      happened at Lima, &c.

He has\r\nabbreviated in this volume a vast amount of information, which has a\r\nfascinating interest for many minds by reason of its relation to the\r\npast history and future destiny of this little bubble of earth upon\r\nwhich we sail through the infinite spaces of ether.”—_New York Home\r\nJournal._\r\n\r\n“The book gives an exhaustive statement of the phenomena of volcanoes,\r\nand of the facts in the formation of mountain-chains, and relates a\r\nmass of interesting observations and facts, the results of patient and\r\nextensive personal investigation and study, mostly in different places\r\nin Southern Europe, but not neglecting the world’s larger volcanoes in\r\nother regions.”—_Hartford Times._\r\n\r\n“A fascinating example of patient observation, sound judgment, and\r\nacute reasoning. Under Professor Judd’s skillful treatment the volcano\r\nis forced not only to tell its own history, but also to solve a number\r\nof earth problems seemingly disconnected with it; and the story is\r\ntold in strong, nervous language, and with an earnestness and subdued\r\nenthusiasm that are delightfully stimulating.”—_Boston Gazette._\r\n\r\n“Professor Judd first points out the errors in the old definition of\r\na volcano. The volcanic hole is very often not on the summit, but\r\non the side, sometimes at the base of the mountain or hill, and it\r\nsends forth steam rather than smoke, and the supposed raging flames\r\nare nothing more than the glowing light of a mass of molten material\r\nreflected from those vapor-clouds. So our old ignorance vanishes, and\r\nin this admirable work the internal structure of volcanic mountains,\r\nthe nature and products of volcanic action, and the distribution of the\r\nmaterials rejected from volcanic vents, the succession of operations\r\ntaking place at volcanic centers, are all very ably and clearly\r\ndiscussed.”—_Philadelphia Times._\r\n\r\n“A succinct and excellent treatise on a very interesting\r\nsubject.”—_Philadelphia North American._\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n_For sale by all booksellers; or sent by mail, post paid, on receipt of\r\n                                price._\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n          New York: D.

He takes up the leading modern\r\ndoctrines which are based upon this mechanical conception, such as\r\nthe atomic constitution of matter, the kinetic theory of gases, the\r\nconservation of energy, the nebular hypothesis, and other views, to\r\nfind how much stands upon solid empirical ground, and how much rests\r\nupon metaphysical speculation. Since the appearance of Dr. Draper’s\r\n‘Religion and Science,’ no book has been published in the country\r\ncalculated to make so deep an impression on thoughtful and educated\r\nreaders as this volume.... The range and minuteness of the author’s\r\nlearning, the acuteness of his reasoning, and the singular precision\r\nand clearness of his style, are qualities which very seldom have been\r\njointly exhibited in a scientific treatise.”—_New York Sun._\r\n\r\n“Judge J. B. Stallo, of Cincinnati, is a German by birth, and came to\r\nthis country at about the age of seventeen. He was early familiar with\r\nscience, and he lectured for some years in an Eastern college; but\r\nat length he adopted the profession of law. He is also remembered by\r\nmany as an author, having a number of years ago written a metaphysical\r\ntreatise of marked ability for one of his youthful years. His present\r\nbook must be read deliberately, must be studied to be appreciated; but\r\nthe students of science, as well as those of metaphysics, are certain\r\nto be deeply interested in its logical developments. It is a timely and\r\ntelling contribution to the philosophy of science, imperatively called\r\nfor by the present exigencies in the progress of knowledge. It is to be\r\ncommended equally for the solid value of its contents and the scholarly\r\nfinish of its execution.”—_The Popular Science Monthly._\r\n\r\n“The book is of vital interest to a much larger class than\r\nspecialists—to all, in fact, who value clear thinking or are interested\r\nin the accuracy more than the progress of scientific thought. It deals\r\nwith the results and theories of physical science, and in no sense\r\nwith the processes of the laboratory. It is written with a clearness\r\nthat is uncommon in philosophic works and with a desire to find truth,\r\nconscious of the fact that a prime prerequisite of finding it is to\r\nclear the way of accumulated and fast-settling untruths. It is a\r\nscientific rebuke, as severe as it is lucid, of the scientists who\r\nleave their apparatus and go star-gazing: here is the pit into which\r\nthey have fallen.”—_New York World._\r\n\r\n“The volume is an important contribution to scientific discussion,\r\nand is marked by closeness of reasoning, and clearness and cogency of\r\nstatement.”—_Boston Journal._\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n_For sale by all booksellers; or sent by mail, post paid, on receipt of\r\n                                price._\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n            New York: D.
