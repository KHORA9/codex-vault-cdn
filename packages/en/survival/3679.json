S., MEMBER OF THE AUST. INST. OF MINING\r\nENGINEERS;\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"PRACTICAL MINING,\" \"THE GENESIOLOGY OF GOLD,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARER'S NOTE\r\n\r\nThis text was prepared from a 1898 edition, published by Charles Griffin\r\n& Company, Limited; Exeter Street, Strand, London. It is the second\r\nedition, revised. Numerous drawings and diagrams have been omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nSome six years ago the author published a small book entitled \"Practical\r\nMining,\" designed specially for the use of those engaged in the always\r\nfascinating, though not as invariably profitable, pursuit of \"Getting\r\nGold.\" Of this ten thousand copies were sold, nearly all in Australasia,\r\nand the work is now out of print. The London _Mining Journal_ of\r\nSeptember 9th, 1891, said of it: \"We have seldom seen a book in which so\r\nmuch interesting matter combined with useful information is given in so\r\nsmall a space.\"\r\n\r\nThe gold-mining industry has grown considerably since 1891, and it\r\nappeared to the writer that the present would be a propitious time to\r\nbring out a similar work, but with a considerably enlarged scope. What\r\nhas been aimed at is to make \"Getting Gold\" a compendium, in specially\r\nconcrete form, of useful information respecting the processes of winning\r\nfrom the soil and the after-treatment of gold and gold ores,\r\nincluding some original practical discoveries by the author. Practical\r\ninformation, original and selected, is given to mining company\r\ndirectors, mine managers, quartz mill operators, and prospectors. In\r\n\"Rules of Thumb,\" chapters XI. and XII., will be found a large number\r\nof useful hints on subjects directly and indirectly connected with\r\ngold-mining.\r\n\r\nThe author's mining experience extends back thirty years and he\r\ntherefore ventures to believe with some degree of confidence that the\r\ninformation, original or compiled, which the book contains, will be\r\nfound both useful and profitable to those who are in any capacity\r\ninterested in the gold-mining industry.\r\n\r\nJ. C. F. J.\r\n\r\nLONDON, November, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING GOLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nGOLD is a name to charm by. It is desired by all nations, and is the one\r\nmetal the supply of which never exceeds the demand. Some one has aptly\r\nsaid, \"Gold is the most potent substance on the surface of our planet.\"\r\nTom Hood sings:\r\n\r\n     Gold, gold, gold, gold!\r\n     Bright and yellow, hard and cold;\r\n     Molten, graven, hammered, rolled,\r\n     Heavy to get, and light to hold;\r\n     Stolen, borrowed, squandered, doled.\r\n\r\nThat this much appreciated metal is heavy to get is proved by the high\r\nvalue which has been placed on it from times remote to date, and that it\r\nis light to hold most of us know to our cost.\r\n\r\nWe read no farther than the second chapter in the Bible when we find\r\nmention of gold. There Moses speaks of \"the land of Havilah, where there\r\nis gold\"; and in Genesis, chapter xxiv., we read that Abraham's servant\r\ngave Rebekah an earring of half a shekel weight, say 5 dwt. 13 grs.,\r\nand \"two bracelets of ten shekels weight,\" or about 4 1/2 ozs. Then\r\nthroughout the Scriptures, and, indeed, in all historic writings, we\r\nfind frequent mention of the king of metals, and always it is spoken of\r\nas a commodity highly prized.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought, however, that either we are mistaken in the\r\nweights used by the Hebrew nation in early days, or that the arithmetic\r\nof those times was not quite \"according to Cocker.\" We read, I. Kings x.\r\nand xli., that Solomon in one year received no less than six hundred\r\nand three score and six talents of gold. If a talent of gold was, as has\r\nbeen assumed, 3000 shekels of 219 grains each, the value of the golden\r\ntreasure accumulated in this one year by the Hebrew king would have been\r\n3,646,350 pounds sterling. Considering that the only means of \"getting\r\ngold\" in those days was a most primitive mode of washing it from river\r\nsands, or a still more difficult and laborious process of breaking the\r\nquartz from the lode without proper tools or explosives, and then slowly\r\ngrinding it by hand labour between two stones, the amount mentioned is\r\ntruly enormous.\r\n\r\nOf this treasure the Queen of Sheba, who came to visit the Hebrew\r\nmonarch, contributed a hundred and twenty talents, or, say, 600,000\r\npounds worth. Where the Land of Ophir, whence this golden lady came, was\r\nreally situated has evoked much controversy, but there is now a general\r\nopinion that Ophir was on the east coast of Africa, somewhere near\r\nDelagoa Bay, in the neighbourhood of the Limpopo and Sabia rivers. It\r\nshould be mentioned that the name of the \"black but comely\" queen was\r\nSabia, which may or may not be a coincidence, but it is certainly true\r\nthat the rivers of this district have produced gold from prehistoric\r\ntimes till now.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of remarkable ruins in the newly acquired province of\r\nMashonaland, which evince a high state of civilisation in the builders,\r\nmay throw some light on this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nThe principal value of gold is as a medium of exchange, and its high\r\nappreciation is due, first, to the fact that it is in almost universal\r\nrequest; and, secondly, to its comparative scarcity; yet, oddly enough,\r\nwith the exception of that humble but serviceable metal iron, gold is\r\nthe most widely distributed metal known. Few, if any, countries do not\r\npossess it, and in most parts of the world, civilised and uncivilised,\r\nit is mined for and brought to market. The torrid, temperate, and frigid\r\nzones are almost equally auriferous. Siberia, mid-Asia, most parts of\r\nEurope, down to equatorial and southern Africa in the Old World, and\r\nnorth, central, and southern America, with Australasia, in what may be\r\ntermed the New World, are all producers of gold in payable quantities.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier ages, the principal source of the precious metal was\r\nprobably Africa, which has always been prolific in gold. To this day\r\nthere are to be seen in the southern provinces of Egypt excavations and\r\nthe remains of old mine buildings and appliances left by the ancient\r\ngold-miners, who were mostly State prisoners. Some of these mines were\r\nworked by the Pharaohs of, and before, the time of Moses; and in these\r\ndreadful places thousands of Israelites were driven to death by the\r\ntaskmaster's whip. Amongst the old appliances is one which approximated\r\nvery closely to the amalgamating, or blanket table, of a modern quartz\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nThe grinding was done between two stones, and possibly by means of such\r\nprimitive mechanism as is used to-day by the natives of Korea.\r\n\r\nThe Korean Mill is simply a large hard stone to which a rocking motion\r\nis given by manual power by means of the bamboo handles while the ore is\r\ncrushed between the upper and basement stone.\r\n\r\nSolomon says \"there is no new thing under the sun\"; certainly there is\r\nmuch that is not absolutely new in appliances for gold extraction. I\r\nlately learned that the principle of one of our newest concentrating\r\nmachines, the Frue vanner, was known in India and the East centuries\r\nago; and we have it on good authority--that of Pliny--that gold saving\r\nby amalgamation with mercury was practised before the Christian era.\r\nIt will not be surprising then if, ere long, some one claims to have\r\ninvented the Korean Mill, with improvements.\r\n\r\nFew subjects in mineralogical science have evoked more controversy than\r\nthe origin of gold. In the Middle Ages, and, indeed, down to the time\r\nof that great philosopher, Sir Isaac Newton, who was himself bitten\r\nwith the craze, it was widely believed that, by what was known as\r\ntransmutation, the baser metals might be changed to gold; and much time\r\nand trouble were expended in attempts to make gold--needless to say\r\nwithout the desired result. Doubtless, however, many valuable additions\r\nto chemical science, and also some useful metallic alloys, were thus\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe latest startling statement on this subject comes from, of course,\r\nthe wonderland of the world, America. In a recently published journal it\r\nis said that a scientific metallurgist there has succeeded in producing\r\nabsolutely pure gold, which stands all tests, from silver. Needless\r\nto say, if this were true, at all events the much vexed hi-metallic\r\nquestion would be solved at once and for all time.\r\n\r\nIt is now admitted by all specialists that the royal metal, though\r\ndiffering in material respects in its mode of occurrence from its\r\nuseful but more plebeian brethren of the mineral kingdom, has yet been\r\ndeposited under similar conditions from mineral salts held in solution.\r\n\r\nThe first mode of obtaining this much desired metal was doubtless by\r\nwashing the sand of rivers which flowed through auriferous strata. Some\r\nof these, such as the Lydian stream, Pactolus, were supposed to renew\r\ntheir golden stores miraculously each year. What really happened was\r\nthat the winter floods detached portions of auriferous drift from the\r\nbanks, which, being disintegrated by the rush and flow of the water,\r\nwould naturally deposit in the still reaches and eddies any gold that\r\nmight be contained therein.\r\n\r\nThe mode of washing was exactly that carried on by the natives in\r\nsome districts of Africa to-day. A wooden bowl was partly filled with\r\nauriferous sand and mud, and, standing knee-deep in the stream, the\r\noperator added a little water, and caused the contents of the bowl to\r\ntake a circular motion, somewhat as the modern digger does with his tin\r\ndish, with this difference, that his ancient prototype allowed the water\r\nand lighter particles to escape over the rim as he swirled the stuff\r\nround and round. I presume, in finishing the operation, he collected\r\nthe golden grains by gently lapping the water over the reduced material,\r\nmuch as we do now.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the mode in which auriferous lode-stuff was\r\ntreated in early times--i.e., by grinding between stones. This is also\r\npractised in Africa to-day, and we have seen that the Koreans, with\r\nMongolian acuteness, have gone a step farther, and pulverise the quartz\r\nby rocking one stone on another. In South America the arrastra is still\r\nused, which is simply the application of horse or mule power to the\r\nstone-grinding process, with use of mercury.\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of the gold supply of the modern world have\r\nbeen, first, South America, Transylvania in Europe, Siberia in Asia,\r\nCalifornia in North America, and Australia. Africa has always produced\r\ngold from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nThe later development in the Johannesburg district, Transvaal, which has\r\nabsorbed during the last few years so many millions of English capital,\r\nis now, after much difficulty and disappointment--thanks to British\r\npluck and skill--producing splendidly. The yield for 1896 was 2,281,874\r\nounces--a yield never before equalled by lode-mining from one field.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1847 gold was discovered in California, at Sutor's sawmill,\r\nSacramento Valley, where, on the water being cut off, yellow specks and\r\nsmall nuggets were found in the tail race. The enormous \"rush\" which\r\nfollowed is a matter of history and the subject of many romances, though\r\nthe truth has, in this instance, been stranger than fiction.\r\n\r\nThe yield of the precious metal in California since that date up to 1888\r\namounts to 256,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nFollowing close on the American discovery came that of Australia, the\r\ncredit of which has usually been accorded to Hargraves, a returned\r\nCalifornian digger, who washed out payable gold at Lewis Ponds Creek,\r\nnear Bathurst, in 1851. But there is now no reason to doubt that gold\r\nhad previously been discovered in several parts of that great island\r\ncontinent. It may be news to many that the first gold mine worked in\r\nAustralia was opened about twelve miles from Adelaide city, S.A., in the\r\nyear 1848. This mine was called the Victoria; several of the Company's\r\nscrip are preserved in the Public Library; but some two years\r\nprevious to this a man named Edward Proven had found gold in the same\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nMost Governments nowadays encourage in every possible way the discovery\r\nof gold-fields, and rewards ranging from hundreds to thousands of pounds\r\nare given to successful prospectors of new auriferous districts. The\r\nreward the New South Wales authorities meted out to a wretched convict,\r\nwho early in this century had dared to find gold, was a hundred lashes\r\nvigorously laid on to his already excoriated back. The man then very\r\nnaturally admitted that the alleged discovery was a fraud, and that\r\nthe nugget produced was a melted down brass candlestick. One would have\r\nimagined that even in those unenlightened days it would not have been\r\ndifficult to have found a scientist sufficiently well informed to put a\r\nlittle nitric acid on the supposed nugget, and so determine whether it\r\nwas the genuine article, without skinning a live man first to ascertain.\r\nMy belief is that the unfortunate fellow really found gold, but, as Mr.\r\nDeas Thompson, the then Colonial Secretary, afterwards told Hargraves in\r\ndiscouraging his reported discovery, \"You must remember that as soon\r\nas Australia becomes known as a gold-producing country it is utterly\r\nspoiled as a receptacle for convicts.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the secret of the unwillingness of the authorities to\r\nencourage the search for gold, and it is after all due to the fact\r\nthat the search was ultimately successful beyond all precedent,\r\nthat Australia has been for so many years relieved of the curse of\r\nconvictism, and has ceased once and for all to be a depot for the\r\nscoundrelism of Britain--\"Hurrah for the bright red gold!\"\r\n\r\nSince the year 1851 to date the value of the gold raised in the\r\nAustralasian colonies has realised the enormous amount of nearly\r\n550,000,000 pounds. One cannot help wondering where it all goes.\r\n\r\nMulhall gives the existing money of the world at 2437 million pounds,\r\nof which 846 millions are paper, 801 millions silver, and 790 millions\r\ngold. From 1830 to 1880 the world consumed by melting down plate, etc.,\r\n4230 tons of silver more than it mined. From 1800 to 1870 the value of\r\ngold was about 15 1/2 times that of silver. From 1870 to 1880 it was 167\r\ntimes the value of silver and now exceeds it over twenty times. In 1700\r\nthe world had 301 million pounds of money; in 1800, 568 million pounds;\r\nand in 1860, 1180 million pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nThe gold first worked for in Australia, as in other places, was of\r\ncourse alluvial, by which is usually understood loose gold in nuggets,\r\nspecks, and dust, lying in drifts which were once the beds of long\r\nextinct streams and rivers, or possibly the moraines of glaciers, as in\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\nFurther on the differences will be mentioned between \"alluvial\" and\r\n\"reef\" or lode gold, for that there is a difference in origin in many\r\noccurrences, is, I think, provable. I hold, and hold strongly, that true\r\nalluvial gold is not always derived from the disintegration of lodes or\r\nreefs. For instance, the \"Welcome Nugget\" certainly never came from a\r\nreef. No such mass of gold, or anything approaching it, has ever yet\r\nbeen taken from a quartz matrix. It was found at Bakery Hill, Ballarat,\r\nin 1858, weight 2195 ozs., and sold for 10,500 pounds. This was above\r\nits actual value.\r\n\r\nThe \"Welcome Stranger,\" a still larger mass of gold, was found amongst\r\nthe roots of a tree at Dunolly, Victoria, in 1869, by two starved out\r\n\"fossickers\" named Deeson and Oates. The weight of this, the largest\r\nauthenticated nugget ever found was 2268 1/2 ozs., and it was sold for\r\n10,000 pounds, but it was rendered useless as a specimen by the finders,\r\nwho spent a night burning it to remove the adhering quartz.\r\n\r\nBut the ordinary digger neither hopes nor expects to unearth such\r\ntreasures as these. He is content to gather together by means of\r\npuddling machine, cradle, long tom, or even puddling tub and tin dish,\r\nthe scales, specks, dust, and occasional small nuggets ordinarily met\r\nwith in alluvial \"washes.\"\r\n\r\nHaving sunk to the \"wash,\" or \"drift,\" the digger, by means of one or\r\nmore of the appliances mentioned above, proceeds to separate the gold\r\nfrom the clay and gravel in which it is found. Of course in large\r\nalluvial claims, where capital is employed, such appliances are\r\nsuperseded by steam puddles, buddles, and other machinery, and sometimes\r\nmercury is used to amalgamate the gold when very fine. Hydraulicing is\r\nthe cheapest form of alluvial mining, but can only be profitably carried\r\nout where extensive drifts, which can be worked as quarry faces, and\r\nunlimited water exist in the same neighbourhood. When such conditions\r\nobtain a few grains of gold to the yard or ton will pay handsomely.\r\n\r\nLode or reef mining, is a more expensive and complicated process,\r\nrequiring much skill and capital. First, let me explain what a lode\r\nreally is. The American term is \"ledge,\" and it is not inappropriate or\r\ninexpressive. Imagine then a ledge, or kerbstone, continuing to unknown\r\ndepths in the earth at any angle varying from perpendicular to nearly\r\nhorizontal. This kerbstone is totally distinct from the rocks which\r\nenclose it; those on one side may be slate, on the other, sandstone; but\r\nthe lode, separated usually by a small band of soft material known\r\nto miners as \"casing,\" or \"fluccan,\" preserves always an independent\r\nexistence, and in many instances is practically bottomless so far as\r\nhuman exploration is concerned.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, reefs or lodes which are not persistent in depth.\r\nSometimes the lode formation is found only in the upper and newer\r\nstrata, and cuts out when, say, the basic rocks (such as granite, etc.)\r\nare reached. Again, there is a form of lode known among miners as a\r\n\"gash\" vein. It is sometimes met with in the older crystalline slates,\r\nparticularly when the lode runs conformably with the cleavage of the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nMuch ignorance is displayed on the subject of lode formation and the\r\ndeposition of metals therein, even by mining men of long experience.\r\nMany still insist that lodes, particularly those containing gold, are of\r\nigneous origin, and point to the black and brown ferro-manganic outcrops\r\nin confirmation. It must be admitted that often the upper portions of\r\na lode present a strong appearance of fire agency, but exactly the same\r\nappearance can be caused by oxidation of iron and manganese in water.\r\n\r\nIt may now be accepted as a proven fact that no true lode has been\r\nformed, or its metals deposited except by aqueous action. That is to\r\nsay, the bulk of the lode and all its metalliferous contents were once\r\nheld in solution in subterranean waters, which were ejected by geysers\r\nor simply filtered into fissures formed either by the shrinkage of the\r\nearth's crust in process of cooling or by volcanic force.\r\n\r\nIt is not contended that the effect of the internal fires had no\r\ninfluence on the formation of metalliferous veins, indeed, it is certain\r\nthat they had, but the action was what is termed hydrothermal (hot\r\nwater); and such action we may see in progress to-day in New Zealand,\r\nwhere hot springs stream or spout above the surface, when the silica\r\nand lime impregnated water, reduced in heat and released from pressure,\r\nbegins forthwith to deposit the minerals previously held in solution.\r\nHence the formation of the wondrous Pink and White Terrace, destroyed\r\nby volcanic action some eight years since, which grew almost while\r\nyou watched; so rapidly was the silica deposited that a dead beetle or\r\nti-tree twig left in the translucent blue water for a few days became\r\ncompletely coated and petrified.\r\n\r\nGold differs in its mode of occurrence from other metals in many\r\nrespects; but there is no doubt that it was once held in aqueous\r\nsolution and deposited in its metallic form by electro-chemical action.\r\nIt is true we do not find oxides, carbonates, or bromides of gold in\r\nNature, nor can we feel quite sure that gold now exists naturally as a\r\nsulphide, chloride, or silicate, though the presumption is strongly\r\nthat it does. If so, the deposition of the gold may be ceaselessly\r\nprogressing.\r\n\r\nGenerally reef gold is finer as to size of the particles, and, as a\r\nrule, inferior in quality to alluvial. Thus, in addition to the extra\r\nlabor entailed in breaking into one of the hardest of rocks, quartz,\r\nthe _madre de oro_ (\"mother of gold\") of the Spaniards, there is the\r\nadditional labour required to pulverise the rock so as to set free the\r\ntiniest particles of the noble metal it so jealously guards. There is\r\nalso the additional difficult operation of saving and gathering together\r\nthese small specks, and so producing the massive cakes and bars of gold\r\nin their marketable state.\r\n\r\nHaving found payable gold in quartz on the surface, the would-be miner\r\nhas next to ascertain two things. First, the strike or course of the\r\nlode; and secondly, its underlie, or dip. The strike, or course, is the\r\ndirection which the lode takes lengthwise.\r\n\r\nIn Australia the term \"underlie\" is used to designate the angle from\r\nthe perpendicular at which the lode lies in its enclosing rocks, and by\r\n\"dip\" the angle at which it dips or inclines lengthwise on its course.\r\nThus, at one point the cap of a lode may appear on the surface, and some\r\ndistance further the cap may be hundreds of feet below. Usually a shaft\r\nis sunk in the reef to prove the underlie, and a level, or levels,\r\ndriven on the course to ascertain its direction underground, also if\r\nthe gold extends, and if so, how far. This being proved, next a vertical\r\nshaft is sunk on the hanging or upper wall side, and the reef is either\r\ntapped thereby, or a cross-cut driven to intersect it.\r\n\r\nWe will now assume that our miners have found their lode payable, and\r\nhave some hundreds of tons of good gold-bearing stone in sight or at the\r\nsurface. They must next provide a reducing plant. Of means for crushing\r\nor triturating quartz there is no lack, and every year gives us fresh\r\ninventions for the purpose, each one better than that which preceded\r\nit, according to its inventor. Most practical men, however, prefer to\r\ncontinue the use of the stamper battery, which is virtually a pestle\r\nand mortar on a large scale. Why we adhere to this form of pulverising\r\nmachine is that, though somewhat wasteful of power, it is easily\r\nunderstood, its wearing parts are cheaply and expeditiously replaced,\r\nand it is so strong that even the most perversely stupid workman cannot\r\neasily break it or put it out of order.\r\n\r\nThe stone, being pounded into sand of such degree of fineness as\r\nthe gold requires, passes through a perforated iron plate called a\r\n\"grating,\" or \"screen,\" on to an inclined surface of copper plates faced\r\nwith mercury, having small troughs, or \"riffles,\" containing mercury,\r\nplaced at certain distances apart.\r\n\r\nThe crushed quartz is carried over these copper \"tables,\" as they are\r\ntermed, thence over the blanket tables--that is, inclined planes covered\r\nwith coarse serge, blankets, or other flocculent material--so that the\r\nheavy particles may be caught in the hairs, or is passed over vanners or\r\nconcentrating machines. The resulting \"concentrates\" are washed off from\r\ntime to time and reserved for secondary treatment.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, they are roasted to get rid of the sulphur, arsenic,\r\netc., which would interfere with the amalgamation or lixiviation, and\r\nthen either ground to impalpable fineness in one of the many triturating\r\npans with mercury, or treated by chlorine or potassium cyanide.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we are merely amalgamating, then at stated periods the\r\nbattery and pans are cleaned out, the amalgam rubbed or scraped from\r\nthe copper plates and raised from the troughs and riffles. It is then\r\nsqueezed through chamois leather, or good calico will do as well, and\r\nretorted in a large iron retort, the nozzle of which is kept in water so\r\nas to convert the mercury vapour again to the metallic form. The result\r\nis a spongy cake of gold, which is either sold as \"retorted\" gold or\r\nsmelted into bars.\r\n\r\nThe other and more scientific methods of extracting the precious metal\r\nfrom its matrices, such as lixiviation or leaching, by means of solvents\r\n(chlorine, cyanogen, hyposulphite of soda, etc.), will be more fully\r\ndescribed later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGOLD PROSPECTING--ALLUVIAL AND GENERAL\r\n\r\nIt is purposed in this chapter to deal specially with the operation of\r\nsearching for valuable mineral by individuals or small working parties.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that much disappointment and loss accrue through lack\r\nof knowledge by prospectors, who with all their enterprise and energy\r\nare often very ignorant, not only of the probable locality, mode of\r\noccurrence, and widely differing appearance of the various valuable\r\nminerals, but also of the best means of locating and testing the ores\r\nwhen found. It is for the information of such as these that this chapter\r\nis mainly intended, not for scientists or miners of large experience.\r\n\r\nAll of us who have had much to do with mining know that the majority of\r\nthe best mineral finds have been made by the purest accident; often\r\nby men who had no mining knowledge whatever; and that many valuable\r\ndiscoveries have been delayed, or, when made, abandoned as not payable,\r\nfrom the same cause--ignorance of the rudiments of mineralogy and\r\nmining. I have frequently been asked by prospectors, when inspecting new\r\nmineral fields, what rudimentary knowledge will be most useful to them\r\nand how it can be best obtained.\r\n\r\nIf a man can spare the time a course of lessons at some accredited\r\nschool of mines will be, undoubtedly, the best possible training; but\r\nif he asks what books he should read in order to obtain some primary\r\ntechnical instruction, I reply: First, an introductory text-book of\r\ngeology, which will tell him in the simplest and plainest language\r\nall he absolutely requires to know on this important subject. Every\r\nprospector should understand elementary geology so far as general\r\nknowledge of the history of the structure of the earth's crust and of\r\nthe several actions that have taken place in the past, or are now in\r\noperation, modifying its conditions. He may with advantage go a few\r\nsteps further and learn to classify the various formations into systems,\r\ngroups, and series: but he can acquire all that he need absolutely know\r\nfrom this useful little 2s. 6d. book. Next, it is advisable to learn\r\nsomething about the occurrence and appearance of the valuable minerals\r\nand the formations in which they are found. For all practical purposes I\r\ncan recommend Cox and Ratte's \"Mines and Minerals,\" one of the Technical\r\nEducation series of New South Wales, which deals largely with the\r\nsubject from an Australian standpoint, and is therefore particularly\r\nvaluable to the Australian miner, but which will be found applicable to\r\nmost other gold-bearing countries. I must not, however, omit to mention\r\nan admirably compiled _multum in parvo_ volume prepared by Mr. G.\r\nGoyder, jun., Government Assayer and Assay Instructor at the School of\r\nMines, Adelaide. It is called the \"Prospectors' Pocketbook,\" costs only\r\none shilling, is well bound, and of handy size to carry. In brief, plain\r\nlanguage it describes how a man, having learned a little of assaying,\r\nmay cheaply provide himself with a portable assay plant, and fluxes, and\r\nalso gives considerable general information on the subject of minerals,\r\ntheir occurrence and treatment.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] Another excellent and really practical book is Prof.\r\n     Cole's \"Practical Aids in Geology\" (second edition), 10s.\r\n     6d.\r\n\r\nIt may here be stated that some twelve years ago I did a large amount\r\nof practical silver assaying on the Barrier (Broken Hill), which was not\r\nthen so accessible a place as it is now, and got closely correct results\r\nfrom a number of different mines, with an extemporised plant almost\r\namusing in its simplicity. All I took from Adelaide were a small set of\r\nscales capable of determining the weight of a button down to 20 ozs. to\r\nthe ton, a piece of cheese cloth to make a screen or sieve, a tin ring\r\n1 1/2 in. diameter, by 1/2 in. high, a small brass door knob to use as\r\na cupel mould, and some powdered borax, carbonate of soda, and argol\r\nfor fluxes; while for reducing lead I had recourse to the lining of a\r\ntea-chest, which lead contains no silver--John Chinaman takes good care\r\nof that. My mortar was a jam tin, without top or bottom, placed on an\r\nanvil; the pestle a short steel drill. The blacksmith at Mundi Mundi\r\nStation made me a small wrought iron crucible, also a pair of bent tongs\r\nfrom a piece of fencing-wire. The manager gave me a small common red\r\nflower pot for a muffle, and with the smith's forge (the fire built\r\nround with a few blocks of talcose schist) for a furnace, my plant was\r\ncomplete. I burned and crushed bones to make my bone-dust for cupelling,\r\nand thus provided made nearly forty assays, some of which were\r\nafterwards checked in Adelaide, in each instance coming as close as\r\ncheck assays generally do. Nowadays one can purchase cheaply a very\r\neffective portable plant, or after a few lessons a man may by practice\r\nmake himself so proficient with the blowpipe as to obtain assay results\r\nsufficiently accurate for most practical purposes.\r\n\r\nComing then to the actual work of prospecting. What the prospector\r\nrequires to know is, first, the usual locality of occurrence of the more\r\nvaluable minerals; secondly, their appearance; thirdly, a simple mode\r\nof testing. With respect to occurrence, the older sandy and clay slates,\r\nchlorite slates, micaceous, and hornblendic schists, particularly at or\r\nnear their junction with the intrusive granite and diorite, generally\r\nform the most likely geological country for the finding of mineral\r\nlodes, particularly gold, silver and tin. But those who have been\r\nengaged in practical mining for long, finding by experience that no two\r\nmineral fields are exactly alike in all their characteristics, have come\r\nto the conclusion that it is unwise to form theories as to why metals\r\nshould or should not be found in certain enclosing rocks or matrices.\r\nSome of the best reef gold got in Victoria has been obtained in dead\r\nwhite, milky-looking quartz almost destitute of base metal. In South\r\nAustralia reef gold is almost invariably associated with iron, either\r\nas oxide, as \"gossan;\" or ferruginous calcite, \"limonite;\" or granular\r\nsilica, conglomerated by iron, the \"ironstone\" which forms the capping\r\nor outcrop of many of our reefs, and which is often rich in gold.\r\n\r\nBut to show that it is unsafe to decide off-hand in what class of matrix\r\nmetals will or will not be found, I may say that in my own experience I\r\nhave seen payable gold in the following materials:--\r\n\r\nQuartz, dense and milky, also in quartz of nearly every colour and\r\nappearance, saccharoidal, crystalline, nay, even in clear glass-like\r\nsix-sided prismatic crystals, and associated with silver, copper, lead,\r\narsenic, iron as sulphide, oxide, carbonate, and tungstate, antimony,\r\nbismuth, nickel, zinc, lead, and other metals in one form or another;\r\nin slate, quartzite, mica schist, granite, diorite, porphyry, felsite,\r\ncalcite, dolomite, common carbonate of iron, siliceous sinter from a hot\r\nspring, as at Mount Morgan; as alluvial gold in drifts formed of almost\r\nall these materials; and once, perhaps the most curious matrix of all,\r\na small piece of apparently alluvial gold, naturally imbedded in a shaly\r\npiece of coal. This specimen, I think, is in the Sydney Museum. One\r\nthing, however, the prospector may make sure of: he will always find\r\ngold more or less intimately associated with silica (Quartz) in one or\r\nother of its many forms, just as he will always find cassiterite (oxide\r\nof tin) in the neighbourhood of granite containing muscovite (white\r\nmica), which so many people will persist in terming talc. It is stated\r\nto be a fact that tin has never been found more than about two miles\r\nfrom such granite.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of its widely divergent occurrences it will be\r\nadmitted that the Cornish miners' saying with regard to metals generally\r\napplies with great force to gold: \"Where it is, there it is\": and\r\n\"Cousin Jack\" adds, with pathetic emphasis, \"and where it is generally,\r\nthere I ain't.\"\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the geological \"country rock\" in which red gold\r\nis most likely to be discovered--i.e., the junction of the slates and\r\nschists with the igneous or metamorphic (altered) rocks, or in\r\nthis vicinity. Old river beds formed of gravelly drifts in the same\r\nneighbourhood may probably contain alluvial gold, or shallow deposits of\r\n\"wash\" on hillsides and in valleys will often carry good surface gold.\r\nThis is sometimes due to the denudation, or wearing away, of the hills\r\ncontaining quartz-veins--that is, where the alluvial gold really was\r\nderived from such veins, which, popular opinion to the contrary, is not\r\nalways the case.\r\n\r\nMuch disappointment and loss of time and money may sometimes be\r\nprevented if prospectors will realise that _all_ alluvial gold does not\r\ncome from the quartz veins or reefs; and that following up an alluvial\r\nlead, no matter how rich, will not inevitably develop a payable\r\ngold lode. Sometimes gold, evidently of reef origin, is found in the\r\nalluvial; but in that case it is generally fine as regards the size\r\nof the particles, more or less sharp-edged, or crystalline in form if\r\nrecently shed; while such gold is often of poorer quality than the true\r\nalluvial which occurs in mammillary (breast-like) nuggets, and is of a\r\nhigher degree of purity as gold.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary non-scientific digger will do well to give credence to\r\nthis view of the case, and will often thereby save himself much useless\r\ntrouble. Sometimes also the alluvial gold, coarser in size than true\r\nreef-born alluvial, is derived almost _in situ_ from small quartz\r\n\"leaders,\" or veins, which the grinding down of the face of the slates\r\nhas exposed; these leaders in time being also broken and worn, set free\r\nthe gold they have contained, which does not, as a rule, travel far, but\r\nsometimes becomes water-worn by the rubbing over it of the disintegrated\r\nfragments of rock.\r\n\r\nBut the heavy, true alluvial gold, in great pure masses, mammillary, or\r\nbotryoidal (like a bunch of grapes) in shape, have assuredly been\r\nformed by accretion on some metallic base, from gold salts in solution,\r\nprobably chloride, but possibly sulphide.\r\n\r\nNuggets, properly so-called, are never found in quartz lodes; but, as\r\nwill be shown later, a true nugget having all the characteristics of\r\nso-called water-worn alluvial may be artificially formed on a small\r\npiece of galena, or pyrites, by simply suspending the base metal by a\r\nthread in a vessel containing a weak solution of chloride of gold in\r\nwhich a few hard-wood chips are thrown.\r\n\r\nProspecting for alluvial gold at shallow depths is a comparatively easy\r\nprocess, requiring no great amount of technical knowledge. Usually the\r\nfirst gold is got at or near the surface and then traced to deep leads,\r\nif such exist.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Brown Goldfield, N.S.W., in 1881, I saw claimholders turning\r\nout to work equipped only with a small broom made of twigs and a tin\r\ndish. With the broom they carefully swept out the crevices of the\r\ndecomposed slate as it was exposed on the surface, and putting the\r\nresulting dust and fragments into the tin dish proceeded to dry blow it.\r\n\r\nThe _modus operandi_ is as follows: The operator takes the dish about\r\nhalf full of dirt, and standing with his back or side to the wind, if\r\nthere be any, begins throwing the stuff up and catching it, or sometimes\r\nslowly pouring it from one dish to another, the wind in either case\r\ncarrying away the finer particles. He then proceeds to reduce the\r\nquantity by carefully extracting the larger fragments of rock, till\r\neventually he has only a handful or so of moderately fine \"dirt\" which\r\ncontains any gold there may be. If in good sized nuggets it is picked\r\nout, if in smaller pieces or fine grains the digger slowly blows the\r\nsand and dust aside with his breath, leaving the gold exposed. This\r\nprocess is both tedious and unhealthy, and of course can only be carried\r\nout with very dry surface dirt. The stuff in which the gold occurred at\r\nMount Brown was composed of broken slate with a few angular fragments\r\nof quartz. Yet, strange to say, the gold was invariably waterworn in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nDry blowing is now much in vogue on the West Australian fields owing\r\nto the scarcity of water; but the great objection is first, the large\r\namount of dust the unfortunate dry blower has to carry about his person,\r\nand secondly, that the peck of dirt which is supposed to last most men a\r\nlife time has to be made a continuous meal of every day.\r\n\r\nFor wet alluvial prospecting the appliances, besides pick and shovel,\r\nare puddling tub, tin dish, and cradle; the latter, a man handy with\r\ntools can easily make for himself.\r\n\r\nIn sinking, the digger should be careful to avoid making his shaft\r\ninconveniently small, and not to waste his energy by sinking a large\r\n\"new chum\" hole, which usually starts by being about three times too\r\nlarge for the requirements at the surface, but narrows in like a funnel\r\nat 10 feet or less. A shaft, say 4 feet by 2 feet 6 inches and sunk\r\nplumb, the ends being half rounded, is large enough for all requirements\r\nto a considerable depth, though I have seen smart men, when they were in\r\na hurry to reach the drift, get down in a shaft even less in size.\r\n\r\nThe novice who is trying to follow or to find a deep lead must fully\r\nunderstand that the present bed of the surface river may not, in fact\r\nseldom does, indicate the ancient watercourses long since buried either\r\nby volcanic or diluvial action, which contain the rich auriferous\r\ndeposits for which he is seeking; and much judgment and considerable\r\nunderground exploration are often required to decide on the true\r\ncourse of leads. Only by a careful consideration of all the geological\r\nsurroundings can an approximate idea be obtained from surface inspection\r\nalone; and the whole probable conditions which led to the present\r\ncontour of the country must be carefully taken into account.\r\n\r\nHow am I to know the true bottom when I see it? asks the inexperienced\r\ndigger. Well, nothing but long experience and intelligent observation\r\nwill prevent mistakes at times, particularly in deep ground; but as a\r\ngeneral rule, though it may sound paradoxical, you may know the bottom\r\nby the top.\r\n\r\nThat is, we will assume you are sinking in, say, 10 to 12 feet ground in\r\na gully on the bank of which the country rock is exposed, and is, say,\r\nfor instance, a clay slate or sandy slate set at a certain angle; then,\r\nin all probability, unless there be a distinct fault or change in the\r\ncountry rock between the slate outcrop and your shaft, the bottom will\r\nbe a similar slate, standing at the same angle; and this will\r\nvery probably be overlaid by a deposit of pipeclay, formed by the\r\ndecomposition of the slates.\r\n\r\nFrom the crevices of these slates, sometimes penetrating to a\r\nconsiderable distance, you may get gold, but it is useless attempting to\r\nsink through them. If the outcropping strata be a soft calcareous (limy)\r\nsandstone or soft felspathic rock, and that be also the true bottom,\r\ngreat care should be exercised or one is apt to sink through the bottom,\r\nwhich may be very loose and decomposed. I have known mistakes made in\r\nthis way when many feet have been sunk, and driven through what was\r\nactually bed rock, though so soft as to deceive even men of experience.\r\nThe formation, however, must be the guide, and except in some specially\r\ndifficult cases, a man can soon tell when he is really on bed rock or\r\n\"bottom.\"\r\n\r\nOn an alluvial lead the object of every one is to \"get on the gutter,\"\r\nthat is, to reach the lowest part of the old underground watercourse,\r\nthrough which for centuries the gold may have been accretionising from\r\nthe percolation of the mineral-impregnated water; or, when derived from\r\nreefs or broken down leaders, the flow of water has acted as a natural\r\nsluice wherein the gold is therefore most thickly collected. Sometimes\r\nthe lead runs for miles and is of considerable width, at others it is\r\nirregular, and the gold-bearing \"gutter\" small and hard to find. In many\r\ninstances, for reasons not readily apparent, the best gold is not found\r\nexactly at the lowest portion of these narrow gutters, but a little\r\nway up the sides. This fact should be taken into consideration in\r\nprospecting new ground, for many times a claim has been deserted after\r\ncleaning up the \"bottom,\" and another man has got far better gold\r\nconsiderably higher up on the sides of the gutter. For shallow alluvial\r\ndeposits, where a man quickly works out his 30 by 30 feet claim, it may\r\nbe cheaper at times to \"paddock\" the whole ground--that is, take all\r\naway from surface to bottom, but if he is in wet ground and he has to\r\ndrive, great care should be taken to properly secure the roof by means\r\nof timber. How this may best be done the local circumstances only can\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLODE OR REEF PROSPECTING\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter dealt more especially with prospecting as carried\r\non in alluvial fields. I shall now treat of preliminary mining on lodes\r\nor \"reefs.\"\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the likeliest localities for the occurrence\r\nof metalliferous deposits are at or near the junction of the older\r\nsedimentary formations with the igneous or intrusive rocks, such as\r\ngranites, diorites, etc. In searching for payable lodes, whether of\r\ngold, silver, copper, or even tin in some forms of occurrence, the\r\nindications are often very similar. The first prospecting is usually\r\ndone on the hilltops or ridges, because, owing to denudation by ice or\r\nwater which have bared the bedrock, the outcrops are there more exposed,\r\nand thence the lodes are followed down through the alluvial covered\r\nplains, partly by their \"strike\" or \"trend,\" and sometimes by other\r\nindicating evidences, which the practical miner has learned to know.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a lesson in tracing the lode in a grass covered country\r\nwas taught me many years ago by an old prospector who had struck good\r\ngold in the reef at a point some distance to the east of what had been\r\nconsidered the true course. I asked him why he had opened the ground in\r\nthat particular place. Said he, \"Some folks don't use their eyes. You\r\nstand here and look towards that claim on the rise where the reef was\r\nlast struck. Now, don't you see there is almost a track betwixt here and\r\nthere where the grass and herbage is more withered than on either side?\r\nWhy? Well, because the hard quartz lode is close to the surface all the\r\nway, and there is no great depth of soil to hold the moisture and make\r\nthe grass grow.\"\r\n\r\nI have found this simple lesson in practical prospecting of use since.\r\nBut the strike or course of a quartz reef is more often indicated by\r\noutcrops, either of the silica itself or ironstone \"blows,\" as the\r\nminers call them, but the term is a misnomer, as it argues the easily\r\ndisproved igneous theory of veins of ejection, meaning thereby that the\r\nquartz with its metalliferous contents was thrown out in a molten state\r\nfrom the interior of the earth. This has in no case occurred, and the\r\ntheory is an impossible one. True lodes are veins of injection formed\r\nby the infiltration of silicated waters carrying the metals also in\r\nsolution. This water filled the fissures caused either by the cooling of\r\nthe earth's crust, or formed by sudden upheavals of the igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nSometimes in alluvial ground the trend of the reef will be revealed by\r\na track of quartz fragments, more or less thickly distributed on the\r\nsurface and through the superincumbent soil. Follow these along, and at\r\nsome point, if the lode be continuous, a portion of its solid mass will\r\ngenerally be found to protrude and can then again be prospected.\r\n\r\nThere is no rule as to the trend or strike of lodes, except that a\r\ngreater number are found taking a northerly and southerly course than\r\none which is easterly and westerly. At all events, such is the case in\r\nAustralia, but it cannot be said that either has the advantage in being\r\nmore productive. Some of the richest mines in Australasia have been in\r\nlodes running easterly and westerly, while gold, tin, and copper, in\r\ngreat quantity and of high percentage to the ton, have been got in such\r\nmines as Mount Morgan, Mount Bischoff, and the Burra, where there are no\r\nlodes properly so-called at all.\r\n\r\nMount Morgan is the richest and most productive gold mine in Australasia\r\nand amongst the best in the world.\r\n\r\nIts yield for 1895 was 128,699 oz. of gold, valued at 528,700 pounds.\r\nDividends paid in 1895, 300,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis mine was opened in 1886. Up to May 31, 1897, the total yield was\r\n1,631,981 ozs. of gold, sold at 6,712,187 pounds, from which 4,400,000\r\npounds have been paid in dividends. (See _Mining Journal_, for Oct. 9,\r\n1897.)\r\n\r\nMount Morgan shareholders have, in other words, divided over 43 1/2 tons\r\nof standard gold.\r\n\r\nThe Burra Burra Mine, about 100 miles from Adelaide, in a direction\r\na little to the east of north, was found in 1845 by a shepherd named\r\nPickett. It is singularly situated on bald hills standing 130 feet above\r\nthe surrounding country. The ores obtained from this copper mine had\r\nbeen chiefly red oxides, very rich blue and green carbonates, including\r\nmalachite, and also native copper. The discovery of this mine,\r\nsupporting, as it did at one time, a large population, marked a new\r\nera in the history of the colony. The capital invested in it was 12,320\r\npounds in 5 pound shares, and no subsequent call was ever made upon the\r\nshareholders. The total amount paid in dividends was 800,000 pounds.\r\nAfter being worked by the original owners for some years the mine was\r\nsold to a new company, but during the last few years it has not been\r\nworked, owing in some degree to the low price of copper and also to the\r\nfact that the deposit then being worked apparently became exhausted.\r\nFor many years the average yield was from 10,000 to 13,000 tons of ore,\r\naveraging 22 to 23 per cent of copper. It is stated that, during the\r\ntwenty-nine and a half years in which the mine was worked, the company\r\nexpended 2,241,167 in general expenses. The output of ore during the\r\nsame period amounted to 234,648 tons, equal to 51,622 tons of copper.\r\nThis, at the average price of copper, amounted to a money value of\r\n4,749,224 pounds. The mine stopped working in 1877.\r\n\r\nMount Bischoff, Tasmania, has produced, since the formation of the\r\nCompany to December 1895, 47,263 tons of tin ore. It is still in full\r\nwork and likely to be for years to come.\r\n\r\nEach of these immense metalliferous deposits was found outcropping on\r\nthe summit of a hill of comparatively low altitude. There are no true\r\nwalls nor can the ore be traced away from the hill in lode form. These\r\noccurrences are generally held to be due to hydrothermal or geyser\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThen again lodes are often very erratic in their course. Slides and\r\nfaults throw them far from their true line, and sometimes the lode is\r\nrepresented by a number of lenticular (double-pointed in section) masses\r\nof quartz of greater or less length, either continuing point to point or\r\noverlapping, \"splicing,\" as the miners call it. Such formations are very\r\ncommon in West Australia. All this has to be considered and taken into\r\naccount when tracing the run of stone.\r\n\r\nThis tyro also must carefully remember that in rough country where the\r\nlode strikes across hills and valleys, the line of the cap or outcrop\r\nwill apparently be very sinuous owing to the rises and depressions of\r\nthe surface. Many people even now do not understand that true lodes or\r\nreefs are portions of rock or material differing from the surrounding\r\nand enclosing strata, and continuing down to unknown depths at varying\r\nangles. Therefore, if you have a north and south lode outcropping on\r\na hill and crossing an east and west valley, the said lode, underlying\r\neast, when you have traced its outcrop to the lowest point in the\r\nvalley, between the two hills, will be found to be a greater or less\r\ndistance, according to the angle of its dip or underlie, to the east of\r\nthe outcrop on the hill where it was first seen. If it be followed up\r\nthe next hill it will come again to the west, the amount of apparent\r\ndeviation being regulated by the height of the hills and depth of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nA simple demonstration will make this plain. Take a piece of half-inch\r\npine board, 2 ft. long and 9 in. wide, and imagine this to be a lode;\r\nnow cut a half circle out of it from the upper edge with a fret saw and\r\nlean the board say at an angle of 45 degrees to the left, look along the\r\ntop edge, which you are to consider as the outcrop on the high ground,\r\nthe bottom of the cut being the outcrop in the valley, and it will be\r\nseen that the lowest portion of the cut is some inches to the right; so\r\nit is with the lode, and in rough country very nice judgment is required\r\nto trace the true course.\r\n\r\nFor indications, never pass an ironstone \"blow\" without examination.\r\nRemember the pregnant Cornish saying with regard to mining and the\r\ncurrent aphorism, \"The iron hat covers the golden head.\" \"Cousin Jack,\"\r\nput it \"Iron rides a good horse.\" The ironstone outcrop may cover a\r\ngold, silver, copper or tin lode.\r\n\r\nIf you are searching for gold, the presence of the royal metal should be\r\napparent on trial with the pestle and mortar; if silver, either by sight\r\nin one of its various forms or by assay, blowpipe or otherwise; copper\r\nwill reveal itself by its peculiar colour, green or blue carbonates, red\r\noxides, or metallic copper. It is an easy metal to prospect for, and\r\nits percentage is not difficult to determine approximately. Tin is more\r\ndifficult to identify, as it varies so greatly in appearance.\r\n\r\nHaving found your lode and ascertained its course, you want next\r\nto ascertain its value. As a rule (and one which it will be well to\r\nremember) if you cannot find payable metal, particularly in gold \"reef\"\r\nprospecting, at or near the surface, it is not worth while to sink,\r\nunless, of course, you design to strike a shoot of metal which some one\r\nhas prospected before you. The idea is exploded that auriferous lodes\r\nnecessarily improve in value with depth. The fact is that the metal in\r\nany lode is not, as a rule, equally continuous in any direction, but\r\noccurs in shoots dipping at various angles in the length of the lode, in\r\nbunches or sometimes in horizontal layers. Nothing but actual exploiting\r\nwith pick, powder, and brains, particularly brains, will determine this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nWhere there are several parallel lodes and a rich shoot has been found\r\nin one and the length of the payable ore ascertained, the neighbouring\r\nlodes should be carefully prospected opposite to the rich spot, as often\r\nsimilar valuable deposits will thus be found. Having ascertained that\r\nyou have, say, a gold reef payable at surface and for a reasonable\r\ndistance along its course, you next want to ascertain its underlie or\r\ndip, and how far the payable gold goes down.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule in many parts of Australia--though by no means an\r\ninflexible rule--a reef running east of north and west of south will\r\nunderlie east; if west of north and east of south it will go down to the\r\nwestward and so round the points of the compass till you come to east\r\nand west; when if the strike of the lodes in the neighbourhood has\r\ncome round from north-east to east and west the underlie will be to the\r\nsouth; if the contrary was the case, to the north. It is surprising how\r\noften this mode of occurrence will be found to obtain. But I cannot too\r\nstrongly caution the prospector not to trust to theory but to prove his\r\nlode and his metal by following it down on the underlie. \"Stick to your\r\ngold\" is an excellent motto. As a general thing it is only when the\r\nlode has been proved by an underlie shaft to water level and explored by\r\ndriving on its course for a reasonable distance that one need begin to\r\nthink of vertical shafts and the scientific laying out of the mine.\r\n\r\nA first prospecting shaft need not usually be more than 5 ft. by 3 ft.\r\nor even 5 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in., particularly in dry country. One may often\r\nsee in hard country stupid fellows wasting time, labour, and explosives\r\nin sinking huge excavations as much as 10 ft. by 8 ft. in solid rock,\r\nsometimes following down 6 inches of quartz.\r\n\r\nWhen your shaft is sunk a few feet, you should begin to log up the top\r\nfor at least 3 ft. or 4 ft., so as to get a tip for your \"mullock\"\r\nand lode stuff. This is done by getting a number of logs, say 6 inches\r\ndiameter, lay one 7 ft. log on each side of your shaft, cut two notches\r\nin it 6 ft. apart opposite the ends of the shaft, lay across it a 5 ft.\r\nlog similarly notched, so making a frame like a large Oxford picture\r\nframe. Continue this by piling one set above another till the desired\r\nheight is attained, and on the top construct a rough platform and erect\r\nyour windlass. If you have an iron handle and axle I need not tell\r\nyou how to set up a windlass, but where timber is scarce you may put\r\ntogether the winding appliance described in the chapter headed \"Rules of\r\nThumb.\"\r\n\r\nIf you have \"struck it rich\" you will have the pleasure of seeing your\r\nprimitive windlass grow to a \"whip,\" a \"whim,\" and eventually to a\r\nbig powerful engine, with its huge drum and Eiffel tower-like \"poppet\r\nheads,\" or \"derrick,\" with their great spindle pulley wheels revolving\r\nat dizzy speed high in air.\r\n\r\n\"How shall I know if I have payable gold so as to save time and trouble\r\nin sinking?\" says the novice. Truly it is a most important part of the\r\nprospector's art, whether he be searching for alluvial or reef gold,\r\nstream or lode tin, copper, or other valuable metal.\r\n\r\nI presume you know gold when you see it?\r\n\r\nIf you don't, and the doubtful particle is coarse enough, take a needle\r\nand stick the point into the questionable specimen. If gold the steel\r\npoint will readily prick it; if pyrites or yellow mica the point will\r\nglance off or only scratch it.\r\n\r\nThe great importance of the first prospect from the reef is well shown\r\nby the breathless intensity with which the two bearded, bronzed pioneer\r\nprospectors in some trackless Australian wild bend over the pan in which\r\nthe senior \"mate\" is slowly reducing the sample of powdered lode stuff.\r\nHow eagerly they examine the last pinch of \"black sand\" in the corner\r\nof the dish. Prosperity and easy times, or poverty and more \"hard graft\"\r\nshall shortly be revealed in the last dexterous turn of the pan. Let us\r\nhope it is a \"pay prospect.\"\r\n\r\nThe learner, if he be far afield and without appliances of any kind, can\r\nonly guess his prospect. An old prospector will judge from six ounces of\r\nstuff within a few pennyweights what will be the yield of a ton. I have\r\nseen many a good prospect broken with the head of a pick and panned in\r\na shovel, but for reef prospecting you should have a pestle and mortar.\r\nThe handiest for travelling is a mortar made from a mercury bottle cut\r\nin half, and a not too heavy wrought iron pestle with a hardened face.\r\nTo be particular you require a fine screen in order to get your stuff\r\nto regulated fineness. The best for the prospector, who is often on the\r\nmove, is made from a piece of cheesecloth stretched over a small hoop.\r\n\r\nIf you would be more particular take a small spring balance or an\r\nimprovised scale, such as is described in Mr. Goyder's excellent little\r\nbook, p. 14, which will enable you to weigh down to one-thousandth of a\r\ngrain. It is often desirable to burn your stone before crushing, as\r\nit is thus more easily triturated and will reveal all its gold; but\r\nremember, that if it originally contained much pyrites, unless a similar\r\ncourse is adopted when treated in the battery, some of the gold will be\r\nlost in the pyrites.\r\n\r\nHaving crushed your gangue to a fine powder you proceed to pan it off in\r\na similar manner to that of washing out alluvial earth, except that in\r\nprospecting quartz one has to be much more particular, as the gold is\r\nusually finer. The pan is taken in both hands, and enough water to cover\r\nthe prospect by a few inches is admitted. The whole is then swirled\r\nround, and the dirty water poured off from time to time till the residue\r\nis clean quartz sand and heavy metal. Then the pan is gently tipped, and\r\na side to side motion is given to it, thus causing the heavier contents\r\nto settle down in the corner. Next the water is carefully lapped in over\r\nthe side, the pan being now tilted at a greater angle until the lighter\r\nparticles are all washed away. The pan is then once more righted, and\r\nvery little water is passed over the pinch of heavy mineral a few times,\r\nwhen the gold will be revealed in a streak along the bottom. In this\r\noperation, as in all others, only practice will make perfect, and a few\r\npractical lessons are worth whole pages of written instruction.\r\n\r\nTo make an amalgamating assay that will prove the amount of gold which\r\ncan be got from a ton of your lode, take a number of samples from\r\ndifferent parts, both length and breadth. The drillings from the\r\nblasting bore-holes collected make the best test. When finely triturated\r\nweigh off one or two pounds, place in a black iron pan (it must not be\r\ntinned), with 4 ozs. of mercury, 4 ozs. salt, 4 ozs. soda, and about\r\nhalf a gallon of boiling water; then, with a stick, stir the pulp\r\nconstantly, occasionally swirling the dish as in panning off, till you\r\nfeel certain that every particle of the gangue has come in contact with\r\nthe mercury; then carefully pan off into another dish so as to lose no\r\nmercury. Having got your amalgam clean squeeze it through a piece of\r\nchamois leather, though a good quality of new calico previously wetted\r\nwill do as well. The resulting pill of hard amalgam can then be wrapped\r\nin a piece of brown paper, placed on an old shovel, and the mercury\r\ndriven off over a hot fire; or a clay tobacco pipe, the mouth being\r\nstopped with clay, makes a good retort (see \"Rules of Thumb,\" pipe and\r\npotato retorting). The residue will be retorted gold, which, on being\r\nweighed and the result multiplied by 2240 for a 1 lb. assay, or by\r\n1120 for 2 lb., will give the amount of gold per ton which an ordinary\r\nbattery might be expected to save. Thus 1 grain to the pound, 2240 lbs.\r\nto the ton, would show that the stuff contained 4 oz. 13 dwt. 8 gr. per\r\nton.\r\n\r\nIf there should be much base metal in your sample such as say\r\nstibnite (sulphide of antimony), a most troublesome combination to the\r\namalgamator--instead of the formula mentioned above add to your\r\nmercury about one dwt. of zinc shavings or clippings, and to your water\r\nsufficient sulphuric acid to bring it to about the strength of vinegar\r\n(weaker, if anything, not stronger), place your material preferably in\r\nan earthenware or enamelled basin if procurable, but iron will do, and\r\nintimately mix by stirring and shaking till all particles have had an\r\nopportunity to combine with the mercury. Retort as before described.\r\nThis device is my own invention.\r\n\r\nThe only genuine test after all is the battery, and that, owing to\r\nvarious causes, is often by no means satisfactory. First, there is a\r\nstrong, almost unconquerable temptation to select the stone, thus making\r\nthe testing of a few tons give an unduly high average; but more often\r\nthe trouble is the other way. The stuff is sent to be treated at some\r\ninefficient battery with worn-out boxes, shaky foundations, and uneven\r\ntables, sometimes with the plates not half amalgamated, or coated with\r\nimpurities, the whole concern superintended by a man who knows as little\r\nabout the treatment of auriferous quartz by the amalgamating or any\r\nother processes as a dingo does of the differential calculus. Result:\r\n3 dwt. to the ton in the retort, 30 dwt. in the tailings, and a payable\r\nclaim declared a \"duffer.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the lode is really rich, particularly if it be carrying coarse\r\ngold, and owing to rough country, or distance, a good battery is not\r\navailable, excellent results in a small way may be obtained by the\r\nsomewhat laborious, but simple, process of \"dollying.\" A dolly is a\r\none man power single stamp battery, or rather an extra sized pestle and\r\nmortar (see \"Rules of Thumb\").\r\n\r\nSilver lodes and lodes which frequently carry more or less gold,\r\nare often found beneath the dark ironstone \"blows,\" composed of\r\nconglomerates held together by ferric and manganic oxides; or, where\r\nthe ore is galena, the surface indications will frequently be a whitish\r\nlimey track sometimes extending for miles, and nodules or \"slugs\" of\r\nthat ore will generally be found on the surface from place to place.\r\nMost silver ores are easily recognisable, and readily tested by means of\r\nthe blowpipe or simple fire assay. Sometimes the silver on being tested\r\nis found to contain a considerable percentage of gold as in the great\r\nComstock lode in Nevada. Ore from the big Broken Hill silver load, New\r\nSouth Wales, also contains an appreciable quantity of the more precious\r\nmetal. A natural alloy of gold containing 20 per cent silver, termed\r\nelectrum, is the lowest grade of the noble metal.\r\n\r\nTin, lode, and stream, or alluvial, occurs only as an oxide, termed\r\ncassiterite, and yet you can well appreciate the compliment one Cornish\r\nminer pays to another whose cleverness he wishes to commend, when he\r\nsays of him, \"Aw, he do know tin,\" when you look at a representative\r\ncollection of tin ores. In various shapes, from sharp-edged crystals to\r\nmammillary-shaped nuggets of wood-tin; from masses of 30 lbs. weight to\r\na fine sand, like gunpowder, in colour black, brown, grey, yellow,\r\nred, ruby, white, and sometimes a mingling of several colours, it does\r\nrequire much judgment to know tin.\r\n\r\nStream tin is generally associated with alluvial gold. When such is the\r\ncase there is no difficulty in saving the gold if you save the tin, for\r\nthe yellow metal is of much greater specific gravity. As the natural tin\r\nis an oxide, and therefore not susceptible to amalgamation, the gold can\r\nbe readily separated by means of mercury.\r\n\r\nLode tin sometimes occurs in similar quartz veins to those in which gold\r\nis got, and is occasionally associated with gold. Tin is also found, as\r\nat Eurieowie, in dykes, composed of quartz crystals and large scales\r\nof white mica, traversing the older slates. A similar occurrence\r\ntakes place at Mount Shoobridge and at Bynoe Harbour, in the Northern\r\nTerritory of South Australia; indeed, one could not readily separate\r\nthe stone from these three places if it were mixed. As before stated tin\r\nwill never be found far from granite, and that granite must have white\r\nmica as one of its constituents. It is seldom found in the darker\r\ncoloured rocks, or in limestone country, but it sometimes occurs in\r\ngneiss, mica schist, and chlorite schist. Numerous other minerals are\r\nat times mistaken for tin, the most common of which are tourmaline or\r\nschorl, garnet, wolfram (which is a tungstate of iron with manganese),\r\nrutile or titanic acid, blackjack or zinc blende, together with\r\nmagnetic, titanic, and specular iron in fine grains.\r\n\r\nThis rough and ready mode of determining whether the ore is tin is by\r\nweight and by scratching or crushing, when, what is called the \"streak\"\r\nis obtained. The colour of the tin streak is whitey-grey, which, when\r\nonce known, is not easily mistaken. The specific gravity is about 7.0.\r\nWolfram, which is most like it, is a little heavier, from 7.0 to 7.5,\r\nbut its streak is red, brown, or blackish-brown. Rutile is much lighter,\r\n4.2, and the streak light-brown; tourmaline is only 3.2. Blackjack is\r\n4.3, and its streak yellowish-white.\r\n\r\nI have seen several pounds weight to the dish got in some of the New\r\nSouth Wales shallow sinking tin-fields, and, as a rule, payable gold was\r\nalso present. Fourteen years ago I told Western Australian people, when\r\non a visit to that colony, that the neighbourhood of the Darling range\r\nwould produce rich tin. Lately this had been proved to be the case, and\r\nI look forward to a great development of the tin mining industry in the\r\nsouth-western portion of Westralia.\r\n\r\nThe tin \"wash\" in question may also contain gold, as the country rock of\r\nthe neighbourhood is such as gold is usually found in.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] Since this book was in the printers' hands, the\r\n     discovery of payable gold has been reported from this\r\n     district. A detailed discussion of methods of prospecting\r\n     will be found in chapter ii. Of Le Neve Foster's \"Ore and\r\n     Stone Mining,\" and Mr. S. Herbert Cox's \"Handbook for\r\n     Prospectors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE GENESIOLOGY OF GOLD--AURIFEROUS LODES\r\n\r\nUp to a comparatively recent time it was considered heretical for any\r\none to advance the theory that gold had been deposited where found by\r\nany other agency than that of fire. As late as 1860 Mr. Henry Rosales\r\nconvinced himself, and apparently the Victorian Government also,\r\nthat quartz veins with their enclosed metal had been ejected from\r\nthe interior of the earth in a molten state. His essay, which is very\r\ningenious and cleverly written, obtained a prize which the Government\r\nhad offered, but probably Mr. Rosales himself would not adduce the\r\nsame arguments in support of the volcanic or igneous theory to-day. His\r\nphraseology is very technical; so much so that the ordinary inquirer\r\nwill find it somewhat difficult to follow his reasoning or understand\r\nhis arguments, which have apparently been founded only on the occurrence\r\nof gold in some of the earlier discovered quartz lodes, and the\r\nconclusions at which he arrived are not borne out by later experience.\r\nHe says:--\"While, however, there are not apparent signs of mechanical\r\ndisturbances, during the long period that elapsed from the cooling\r\nof the earth's surface to the deposition of the Silurian and Cambrian\r\nsystems, it is to be presumed that the internal igneous activity of the\r\nearth's crust was in full force, so that on the inner side of it, in\r\nobedience to the laws of specific gravity, chemical attraction, and\r\ncentrifugal force, a great segregation of silica in a molten state\r\ntook place. This molten silica continually accumulating, spreading,\r\nand pressing against the horizontal Cambro-Silurian beds during a long\r\nperiod at length forced its way through the superincumbent strata in all\r\ndirections; and it is abundantly evident, under the conditions of this\r\nforce and the resistance offered to its action, that the line it would\r\nand must choose would be along any continuous and slightly inclined\r\ndiagonal, at times crossing the strata of the schists, though generally\r\npreferring to develop itself and egress between the cleavage planes and\r\ndividing seams of the different schistose beds.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say, \"Another argument to the same end (i.e., the igneous\r\norigin) may be shown from the fact that the auriferous quartz lodes have\r\nexercised a manifest metamorphic action on the adjacent walls or casing;\r\nthey have done so partly in a mineralogical sense, but generally there\r\nhas been a metamorphic alteration of the rock.\" Mr. Rosales then tells\r\nhis readers, what we all know must be the case, that the gold would be\r\nvolatilised by the heat, as would be also the other metals, which he\r\nsays, were in the form of arseniurets and sulphurets; but he fails to\r\nexplain how the sublimated metals afterwards reassumed their metallic\r\nform. Seeing that, in most cases, they would be hermetically enclosed in\r\nmolten and quickly solidifying silica they could not be acted on to\r\nany great extent by aqueous agency. Neither does Mr. Rosales's theory\r\naccount at all for auriferous lodes; which below water level are\r\ncomposed of a solid mass of sulphide of iron with traces of other\r\nsulphides, gold, calcspar, and a comparatively small percentage of\r\nsilica. Nor will it satisfactorily explain the auriferous antimonial\r\nsilica veins of the New England district, New South Wales, in which\r\nquantities of angular and unaltered fragments of slate from the\r\nenclosing rocks are found imbedded in the quartz.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the metamorphism of the enclosing rocks to a greater\r\ndegree of hardness, which Mr. Rosales considered was due to heat, it\r\nshould be remembered that these rocks in their original state were much\r\nsofter and more readily fusible than the quartz, consequently all would\r\nhave been molten and mingled together instead of showing as a rule\r\nclearly defined walls. It is much more rational to suppose that the\r\nincreased hardness imparted to the slates and schists at or near their\r\ncontact with the lode is due to an infiltration of silica from the\r\nsilicated solution which at one time filled the fissure. Few scientists\r\ncan now be found to advance the purely igneous theory of lode formation,\r\nthough it must be admitted that volcanic action has probably had much\r\ninfluence not only in the formation of mineral veins, but also on the\r\noccurrence of the minerals therein. But the action was hydrothermal,\r\njust such as was seen in course of operation in New Zealand a few years\r\nago when, in the Rotomahana district, one could actually see the growing\r\nof the marvellous White and Pink Terraces formed by the release of\r\nsilica from the boiling water exuding from the hot springs, which water,\r\nso soon as the heat and pressure were removed, began to deposit its\r\nsilica very rapidly; while at the Thames Gold-field, in the same country\r\nhot, silicated water continuously boiled out of the walls of some of\r\nthe lodes after the quartz had been removed and re-deposited a siliceous\r\nsinter thereon.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I note the recently published opinions of Professor\r\nLobley, a gentleman whose scientific reputation entitles his utterances\r\nto respect, but who, when he contends that gold is not found in the\r\nproducts of volcanic action is, I venture to think, arguing from\r\ninsufficient premises. Certainly his theories do not hold good either in\r\nAustralasia or America where gold is often, nay, more usually, found at,\r\nor near, either present or past regions of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nIt is always gratifying to have one's theories confirmed by men whose\r\nopinions carry weight in the scientific world. About seventeen years ago\r\nI first published certain theories on gold deposition, which, even then,\r\nwere held by many practical men, and some scientists, to be open to\r\nquestion. Of late years, however, the theory of gold occurrence by\r\ndeposition from mineral salts has been accepted by all but the \"mining\r\nexperts\" who infest and afflict the gold mining camps of the world.\r\nThese opine that gold ought to occur in \"pockets\" only (meaning thereby\r\ntheir own).\r\n\r\nRecently Professor Joseph Le Conte, at a meeting of the American\r\nInstitute of Mining Engineers, criticised a notable essay on the\r\n\"Genesis of Ore Deposits,\" by Bergrath F. Posepny. The Professor's\r\ngeneral conclusions are:\r\n\r\n1. \"Ore deposits, using the term in its widest sense, may take place\r\nfrom any kinds of waters, but especially from alkaline solutions, for\r\nthese are the natural solvents of metallic sulphides, and metallic\r\nsulphides are usually the original form of such deposits.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"They may take place from waters at any temperature and any pressure,\r\nbut mainly from those at high temperature and under heavy pressure,\r\nbecause, on account of their great solvent power, such waters are\r\nheavily freighted with metals.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"The depositing waters may be moving in any direction, up-coming,\r\nhorizontally moving, or even sometimes down-going, but mainly up-coming;\r\nbecause by losing heat and pressure at every step such waters are sure\r\nto deposit abundantly.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Deposits may take place in any kind of waterways--in open fissures,\r\nin incipient fissures, joints, cracks, and even in porous sandstone, but\r\nespecially in great open fissures, because these are the main highways\r\nof ascending waters from the greatest depths.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"Deposits may be found in many regions and in many kinds of rocks,\r\nbut mainly in mountain regions, and in metamorphic and igneous rocks,\r\nbecause the thermosphere is nearer the surface, and ready access thereto\r\nthrough great fissures is found mostly in these regions and in these\r\nrocks.\"\r\n\r\nThese views are in accordance with nearly all modern research into this\r\ninteresting and fruitful subject.\r\n\r\nAmong the theories which they discredit is that ore bodies may usually\r\nbe assumed to become richer in depth. As applied to gold lodes the\r\nteaching of experience does not bear out this view.\r\n\r\nIf it be taken into account that the time in which most of our\r\nauriferous siliceous lodes were formed was probably that indicated in\r\nGenesis as before the first day or period when \"the earth was without\r\nform and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep,\" it will be\r\nrealised that the action we behold now taking place in a small way in\r\nvolcanic regions, was probably then almost universal. The crust of the\r\nearth had cooled sufficiently to permit water to lie on its surface,\r\nprobably in hot shallow seas, like the late Lake Rotomahana. Plutonic\r\naction would be very general, and volcanic mud, ash, and sand would be\r\nejected and spread far and wide, which, sinking to the bottom of the\r\nwater, may possibly be the origin of what we now designate the azoic or\r\nmetamorphic slates and schists, as also the early Cambrian and Silurian\r\nstrata. These, from the superincumbent weight and internal heat, became\r\ncompacted, and, in some cases, crystallised, while at the same time,\r\nfrom the ingress of the surface waters to the heated regions below,\r\nprobably millions of geysers were spouting their mineral impregnated\r\nwaters in all directions; and in places where the crust was thin,\r\nexplosions of super-heated steam caused huge upheavals, rifts, and\r\nchasms, into which these waters returned, to be again ejected, or to\r\nbe the cause of further explosions. Later, as the cooling-process\r\ncontinued, there would be shrinkages of the earth's crust causing other\r\nfissures; intrusive granites further dislocated and upheaved the slates.\r\nAbout this age, probably, when really dry land began to appear, came the\r\nfirst formation of mineral lodes, and the waters, heavily charged with\r\nsilicates, carbonates of lime, sulphides, etc., in solution, commenced\r\nto deposit their contents in solid form when the heat and pressure were\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nI am aware that part of the theory here propounded as to the probable\r\nmode of formation of the immense sedimentary beds of the Archaic or\r\nAzoic period is not altogether orthodox--i.e., that the origin of\r\nthese beds is largely due to the ejection of mud, sand, and ashes from\r\nsubterraneous sources, which, settling in shallow seas, were afterwards\r\naltered to their present form. It is difficult, however, to believe that\r\nat this very early period of geologic history so vast a time had elapsed\r\nas would be required to account for these enormous depositions of\r\nsediment, if they were the result only of the degradation of previously\r\nelevated portions of the earth's surface by water agency. Glacial action\r\nat that time would be out of the question.\r\n\r\nBut what about the metals? Whence came the metallic gold of our reefs\r\nand drifts? What was it originally--a metal or a metallic salt, and if\r\nthe latter, what was its nature?--chloride, sulphide, or silicate, one,\r\nor all three? I incline to the latter hypothesis. All three are known,\r\nand the chemical conditions of the period were favorable for their\r\nnatural production. Assuming that they did exist, the task of\r\naccounting for the mode of occurrence of our auriferous quartz lodes is\r\ncomparatively simple. Chloride of gold is at present day contained in\r\nsea water and in some mineral waters, and would have been likely to be\r\nmore abundant during the Azoic and early Paleozoic period.\r\n\r\nSulphide of gold would have been produced by the action of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen; hence probably our auriferous pyrites lodes, while silicate\r\nof gold might have resulted from a combination of gold chlorides with\r\nsilicic acid, and thus the frequent presence of gold in quartz is\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nA highly interesting and instructive experiment, showing how gold might\r\nbe, and probably was, deposited in quartz veins, was carried out by\r\nProfessor Bischof some years ago. He, having prepared a solution of\r\nchloride of gold, added thereto a solution of silicate of potash,\r\nwhereupon, as he states, the yellow colour of the chloride disappeared,\r\nand in half an hour the fluid turned blue, and a gelatinous dark-blue\r\nprecipitate appeared and adhered to the sides of the vessel. In a\r\nfew days moss-like forms were seen on the surface of the precipitate,\r\npresumably approximating to what we know as dendroidal gold--that\r\nis, having the appearance of moss, fern, or twigs. After allowing the\r\nprecipitate to remain undisturbed under water for a month or two a\r\ndecomposition took place, and in the silicate of gold specks of metallic\r\ngold appeared. From this, the Professor argues, and with good show of\r\nreason, that as we know now that the origin of our quartz lodes was\r\nthe silicates contained in certain rocks, it is probable that a natural\r\nsilicate of gold may be combined with these silicates. If this can be\r\ndemonstrated, the reason for the almost universal occurrence of gold in\r\nquartz is made clear.\r\n\r\nAbout 1870, Mr. Skey, analyst to the New Zealand Geological Survey\r\nDepartment, made a number of experiments of importance in respect to\r\nthe occurrence of gold. These experiments were summarised by Sir James\r\nHector in an address to the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1872.\r\nMr. Skey's experiments disproved the view generally held that gold is\r\nunaffected by sulphur or sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and showed that\r\nthese elements combined with avidity, and that the gold thus treated\r\nresisted amalgamation with mercury. Mr. Skey proved the act of\r\nabsorption of sulphur by gold to be a chemical act, and that electricity\r\nwas generated in sufficient quantity and intensity during the process\r\nto decompose metallic solutions. Sulphur in certain forms had long been\r\nknown to exercise a prejudicial effect upon the amalgamation of gold,\r\nbut this had always been attributed to the combination of the sulphur\r\nwith the quicksilver used. Now, however, it is certain that the\r\nsulphurising of the gold must be taken into account. We must remember\r\nthat the particles of gold in the stone may be enveloped with a film\r\nof auriferous sulphide, by which they are protected from the solvent\r\nactions of the mercury. The sulphurisation of the gold gives no ocular\r\nmanifestation by change of colour or perceptible increase of weight,\r\nas in the case of the formation of sulphides of silver, lead and other\r\nmetals, on account of the extremely superficial action of the sulphur,\r\nand hence probably the existence of the gold sulphide escaped detection\r\nby chemists.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to this subject is the investigation of the mode in which\r\ncertain metals are reduced from their solutions by metallic sulphides,\r\nor, in common language, the influence which the presence of such\r\nsubstances as mundic and galena may exercise in effecting the deposit\r\nof pure metals, such as gold, in mineral lodes. The close relation which\r\nthe richness of gold veins bears to the prevalence of pyrites has been\r\nlong familiar both to scientific observers and to practical miners. The\r\ngold is an after deposit to the pyrites, and, as Mr. Skey was the\r\nfirst to explain, due to its direct reducing influences. By a series of\r\nexperiments Mr. Skey proved that the reduction of the metal was due to\r\nthe direct action of the sulphide, and showed that each grain of iron\r\npyrites, when thoroughly oxidised, will reduce 12 1/4 grains of gold\r\nfrom its solution as chloride. He also included salts of platina and\r\nsilver in this general law, and demonstrated that solutions of any of\r\nthese metals traversing a vein rock containing certain sulphides would\r\nbe decomposed, and the pure metal deposited. We are thus enabled to\r\ncomprehend the constant association of gold, or native alloys of gold\r\nand silver, in veins which traverse rocks containing an abundance\r\nof pyrites, whether they have been formed as the result of either\r\nsub-aqueous volcanic outburst or by the metamorphism of the\r\ndeeper-seated strata which compose the superficial crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nMr. Skey also showed by very carefully conducted experiments that the\r\nmetallic sulphides are not only better conductors of electricity than\r\nhas hitherto been supposed, but that when paired they were capable of\r\nexhibiting strong electro-motive power. Thus, if galena and zinc blende\r\nin acid solutions be connected in the usual manner by a voltaic pair,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen is evolved from the surface of the former, and a\r\ncurrent generated which is sufficient to reduce gold, silver or copper\r\nfrom their solutions in coherent electro-plate films. The attributing\r\nof this property of generating voltaic currents, hitherto supposed to\r\nbe almost peculiar to metals, to such sulphides as are commonly found\r\nin metalliferous veins, further led Mr. Skey to speculate how far the\r\ncurrents discovered to exist in such veins by Mr. E. F. Fox might be\r\nproduced by the gradual oxidation of mixed sulphides, and that veins\r\ncontaining bands of different metallic sulphides, bounded by continuing\r\nwalls, and saturated with mineral waters, may constitute under\r\nsome circumstances a large voltaic battery competent to produce\r\nelectro-deposition of metals, and that the order of the deposit of these\r\nmineral lodes will be found to bear a definite relation to the order\r\nin which the sulphides rank in the table of their electro-motive power.\r\nThese researches may lead to some clearer comprehension of the law which\r\nregulates the distribution of auriferous veins, and may explain why in\r\nsome cases the metal should be nearly pure, while in others it is so\r\nlargely alloyed with silver.\r\n\r\nThe following extract was lately clipped from a mining paper. If true,\r\nthe experiment is interesting:--\r\n\r\n\"An American scientist has just concluded a very interesting and\r\nsuggestive experiment. He took a crushed sample of rich ore from Cripple\r\nCreek, which carried 1100 ozs. of gold per ton, and digested it in a\r\nvery weak solution of sodium chloride and sulphate of iron, making\r\nthe solution correspond as near as practicable to the waters found in\r\nNature. The ore was kept in a place having a temperature little less\r\nthan boiling water for six weeks, when all the gold, except one ounce\r\nper ton, was found to have gone into solution. A few small crystals of\r\npyrite were then placed in the bottle of solution, and the gold began\r\nimmediately to precipitate on them. It was noticeable, however, that the\r\npyrite crystals which were free from zinc, galena, or other extraneous\r\nmatter received no gold precipitate. Those which had such foreign\r\nassociations were beautifully covered with fine gold crystals.\"\r\n\r\nExperimenting in a somewhat similar direction abut twelve months since,\r\nI found that the West Australian mine water, with the addition of an\r\nacid, was a solvent of gold. The idea of boiling it did not occur to me,\r\nas the action was rapid in cold water.\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that gold originally existed as a mineral salt, when and\r\nhow did it take metallic form? Doubtless, just in the same manner as\r\nwe now (by means of well-known reagents which are common in nature)\r\nprecipitate it in the laboratory. With regard to that found in quartz\r\nlodes finely disseminated through the gangue, the change was brought\r\nabout by the same agency which caused the silicic acid to solidify and\r\ntake the form in which we now see it in the quartz veins. Silica is\r\nsoluble in solutions of alkaline carbonates, as shown in New Zealand\r\ngeysers; the solvent action being increased by heat and pressure, so\r\nalso would be the silicate or sulphide of gold. When, however, the\r\nwaters with their contents were released from internal pressure and\r\nbegan to lose their heat the gold would be precipitated together with\r\nthe salts of some other metals, and would, where the waters could\r\npercolate, begin to accretionise, thus forming the heavy or specimen\r\ngold of some reefs. On this class of deposition I shall have more to say\r\nwhen treating of the origin of alluvial gold in the form of nuggets.\r\n\r\nMr. G. F. Becker, of the United States Geological Survey, writing of\r\nthe geology of the Comstock lode, says:--\"Baron Von Richthofen was of\r\nopinion that fluorine and chlorine had played a large part of the ore\r\ndeposition in the Comstock, and this the writer is not disposed to\r\ndeny; but, on the other hand, it is plain that most of the phenomena are\r\nsufficiently accounted for on the supposition that the agents have been\r\nmerely solutions of carbonic and hydro-sulphuric acids. These reagents\r\nwill attack the bisilicates and felspars. The result would be carbonates\r\nand sulphides of metals, earth, alkalies, and free quartz, but quartz\r\nand sulphides of the metals are soluble in solutions of carbonates and\r\nsulphides of the earths and alkalies, and the essential constituents of\r\nthe ore might, therefore, readily be conveyed to openings in the\r\nvein where they would have been deposited on relief of pressure and\r\ndiminution of temperature. An advance boring on the 3000 ft. level of\r\nthe Yellow Jacket struck a powerful stream of water at 3065 ft. (in the\r\nwest country), which was heavily charged with hydrogen sulphide, and\r\nhad a temperature of 170 degrees F., and there is equal evidence of the\r\npresence of carbonic acid in the water of the lower levels. A spring on\r\nthe 2700 ft. level of the Yellow Jacket which showed a temperature\r\nof about 150 degrees F., was found to be depositing a sinter largely\r\ncomposed of carbonates.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while here to speak of the probable reason why gold, and\r\nindeed almost all the metals generally occur in shutes in the lodes; and\r\nwhy, as is often the case, these shutes are found to be more or less in\r\na line with each other in parallel lodes, and why also the junction of\r\ntwo lodes is frequently specially productive. The theory with respect\r\nto these phenomena which appears most feasible is, that at these points\r\ncertain chemical action has taken place, by which the deposition of the\r\nmetals has been specially induced. Generally a careful examination of\r\nthe enclosing rocks where the shute is found will reveal some points of\r\ndifference from the enclosing rocks at other parts of the course of the\r\nlode, and when ore shutes are found parallel in reefs running on the\r\nsame course, bands or belts of similar country rock will be found at the\r\nproductive points. From this we may fairly reason that at these points\r\nthe slow stream filling the lode cavity met with a reagent percolating\r\nfrom this particular band of rock, which caused the deposition of\r\nits metals; and, indeed, I am strongly disposed to believe that the\r\ndeposition of metals, particularly in some loose lodes, may even now be\r\nproceeding. But as in Nature's laboratory the processes, if certain, are\r\nslow, this theory may be difficult to prove.\r\n\r\nWhy the junction of lodes is often found to be more richly metalliferous\r\nthan neighbouring parts is probably because there the depositing\r\nreagents met. This theory is well put by Mr. S. Herbert Cox, late of\r\nSydney, in his useful book, \"Mines and Minerals.\" He says:--\"It is a\r\nwell-known fact in all mining districts that the junctions of lodes are\r\ngenerally the richest points, always supposing that this junction takes\r\nplace in 'kindly country,' and the explanation of this we think is\r\nsimple on the aqueous theory of filling of lodes. The water which is\r\ntraversing two different channels of necessity passes through different\r\nbelts of country, and will thus have different minerals in solution. As\r\na case in point, let us suppose that the water in one lode contained in\r\nsolution carbonates of lime, and the alkalies and silica derived form\r\na decomposition of felspars; and that the other, charged with\r\nhydro-sulphuric acid, brought with it sulphide of gold dissolved in\r\nsulphide of lime. The result of these two waters meeting would be that\r\ncarbonate of lime would be formed, hydro-sulphuric acid would be set\r\nfree, and sulphide of gold would be deposited, as well as silica, which\r\nwas formerly held in solution by the carbonic acid.\"\r\n\r\nMost practical men who have given the subject attention will, I think,\r\nbe disposed to coincide with this view, though there are some who hold\r\nthat the occurrence of these parallel ore shutes and rich deposits at\r\nthe junctions of lodes is due to extraneous electrical agency. Of this,\r\nhowever I have failed to find any satisfactory evidence.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, proof that lodes are actually re-forming and the\r\naction observed is very interesting as showing how the stratification\r\nin some lodes has come about. Instances are not wanting of the growth of\r\nsilica on the sides of the drives in mines. This was so in some of the\r\nmines on the Thames, New Zealand, previously mentioned, where in some\r\ncases the deposition was so rapid as to be noticeable from day to day,\r\nwhilst the big pump was actually choked by siliceous deposits. In old\r\nauriferous workings which have been under water for years, in many parts\r\nof the world, formations of iron and silica have been found on the\r\nwalls and roof, while in mining tunnels which have been long unused\r\nstalactites composed of silica and calcite have formed. Then, again,\r\nexperiments made by the late Professor Cosmo Newbery, in Victoria,\r\nshowed that a distinctly appreciable amount of gold, iron, and silica\r\n(the latter in granular form) could be extracted from solid mine timber;\r\nwhich had been submerged for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nThis reaction then must be in progress at the present time, and\r\ndoubtless under certain conditions pyrites would eventually take\r\nthe place of the timber, as is the case with some of the long buried\r\ndriftwood found in Victorian deep leads. Again, we know that the water\r\nfrom some copper mines is so charged with copper sulphate that if scrap\r\niron be thrown into it, the iron will be taken up by the sulphuric acid,\r\nand metallic copper deposited in its place. All this tends to prove that\r\nthe deposition of metals from their salts, though probably not now\r\nas rapid as formerly, is still ceaselessly going on in some place or\r\nanother where the necessary conditions are favourable.\r\n\r\nWith regard to auriferous pyritic lodes, it does not appear even now to\r\nbe clear, as some scientists assert, that their gold is never found\r\nin chemical combination with the sulphides of the base metals. On the\r\ncontrary, I think much of the evidence points in the other direction.\r\n\r\nI have long been of opinion that it is really so held in many of the\r\nferro-sulphides and arsenio-ferro sulphides. On this subject Mr. T.\r\nAtherton contributed a short article in 1891 to the _Australian Mining\r\nStandard_ which is worthy of notice. He says, referring to an occurrence\r\nof a Natural Sulphide of Gold: \"The existence of gold, in the form of\r\na natural sulphide in conjunction with pyrites, has often been advanced\r\ntheoretically, as a possible occurrence; but up to the present time\r\nhas, I believe, never been established as an actual fact. During my\r\ninvestigation on the ore of the Deep Creek mines, Nambucca, New South\r\nWales, I have found in them what I believe to be gold existing as a\r\nnatural sulphide. The lode is a large irregular one of pure arsenical\r\npyrites carrying, in addition to gold and silver, nickel and cobalt. It\r\nexists in a felsite dyke immediately on the coast. Surrounding it on all\r\nsides are micaceous schists, and in the neighbourhood about half a mile\r\ndistant is a large granite hill about 800 feet high. In the lode and its\r\nwalls are large quantities of pyro-phyllite, and in some parts of the\r\nmine there are deposits of pure white translucent mica, but in the ore\r\nitself it is a yellow or pale olive green, and is never absent from the\r\npyrites.\r\n\r\n\"From the first I was much struck with the exceedingly fine state of\r\ndivision in which the gold existed in the ore. After roasting and very\r\ncarefully grinding down in an agate mortar, I have never been able to\r\nget any pieces of gold exceeding one-thousandth of an inch in diameter,\r\nand the greater quantity is very much finer than this. Careful\r\ndissolving of the pyrites and gangue so as to leave the gold intact\r\nfailed to find it in any larger diameter. As this was a very unusual\r\nexperience in investigations on many other kinds of pyrites, I was led\r\nfurther into the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Ultimately, after a number of experiments, there was nothing left but\r\nto test for gold existing as a natural sulphide. Taking 200 gr. of ore\r\nfrom a sample assaying 17 oz. fine gold per ton, grinding it finely and\r\nheating for some hours with yellow sodium sulphide--on decomposing the\r\nfiltrate and treating for gold I got a result at the rate of 12 oz. per\r\nton. This was repeated several times with the same result.\r\n\r\n\"This sample came from the lode at the 140 ft. level, whilst samples\r\nfrom the higher levels where the ore is more oxidised, although carrying\r\nthe gold in exactly the same degree of fineness, do not give as high a\r\npercentage of auric sulphide.\r\n\r\n\"It would appear that all the gold in the pyrites (and I have never\r\nfound any gold existing apart from the pyrites) has originally taken its\r\nplace there as a sulphide.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Newbery, who made many valuable suggestions on the subject,\r\nsays, speaking of gold in pyritous lodes:\r\n\r\n\"As it (the gold salt) may have been in the same solution that\r\ndeposited the pyrites, which probably contained its iron in the form of\r\nproto-carbonate with sulphates, it was not easy at first to imagine any\r\nordinary salt of gold; but this I find can be accomplished with very\r\ndilute solutions in the presence of an alkaline carbonate and a large\r\nexcess of carbonic acid, both of which are common constituents of\r\nmineral waters, especially in Victoria. This is true of chloride of\r\ngold, and if the sulphide is required in solution, it is only necessary\r\nto charge the solution with an excess of sulphuretted hydrogen. In this\r\nmatter both sulphides may be retained in the same solution, depositing\r\ngradually with the escape of the carbonic acid.\"\r\n\r\nPyritic lodes usually contain a considerable proportion of calcareous\r\nmatter, mostly carbonates, and consequently it appears not improbable\r\nthat the gold may remain in some instances as a sulphide, particularly\r\nin samples of pyrites, in which it cannot be detected even by the\r\nmicroscope until by calcination the iron sulphide is changed to an\r\noxide, wherein the gold may be seen in minute metallic specks. The whole\r\nsubject is full of interest, and careful scientific investigation may\r\nlead to astonishing results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE GENESIOLOGY OF GOLD--AURIFEROUS DRIFTS\r\n\r\nHaving considered the origin of auriferous lodes, and the mode by which\r\nin all probability the gold was conveyed to them and deposited as a\r\nmetal, it is necessary also to inquire into the derivation of the gold\r\nof our auriferous drifts, and the reasons for its occurrence therein.\r\n\r\nWhen quite a lad on the Victorian alluvial fields, I frequently heard\r\nold diggers assert that gold grew in the drifts where found. At the time\r\nwe understood this to mean that it grew like potatoes; and, although not\r\nprepared with a scientific argument to prove that such was not so, the\r\nidea was generally laughed at. I have lived to learn that these old\r\nhard-heads were nearer the truth than possibly they clearly realised,\r\nand that gold does actually grow or agglomerate; and, indeed, is\r\nprobably even now thus growing, though it is likely that the chemical\r\nand electric action in the mineral waters flowing through the drifts is\r\nnot in this age nearly so active as formerly.\r\n\r\nMost boys have tried the experiment of dipping a clean-bladed knife into\r\nsulphate of copper, and so depositing on the steel a film of copper,\r\nwhich adheres closely until worn away. This is a simple demonstration\r\nof a hydro-metallurgical process, though probably young hopeful is not\r\naware of the fact; and it is really by an enlargement of this process\r\nthat our beautiful and artistic gold-and silver-plated ware is produced.\r\n\r\nIn the great laboratory of Nature similar chemical depositions have\r\ntaken place in the past, and may still be in progress; indeed, there is\r\nsound scientific reason to suppose that in certain localities this is\r\neven now the case, and that in this way much of our so-called alluvial\r\ngold has been formed, that is, by the deposition on metallic bases of\r\nthe gold held in solution.\r\n\r\nWe will, however, take, to begin with, the generally accepted theory as\r\nto the occurrence of alluvial gold. First, let it be said, that certain\r\nalluvial gold is unquestionably derived from the denudation of quartz\r\nlodes. Such is the gold dust found in many Asiatic and African rivers,\r\nin the great placer mines of California, as also the gold dust gained\r\nfrom the beach sand on the west coast of New Zealand, or in the enormous\r\nalluvial drifts of the Shoalhaven Valley, New South Wales. Of the\r\nfirst, many fabulous tales are told to account for its being found in\r\nparticular spots each summer after the winter floods, and miraculous\r\nagency was asserted, while the early beachcombers of the Hokitika\r\ndistrict found an equally ridiculous derivation for their gold, which\r\nwas always more plentiful after heavy weather. They imagined that the\r\nbreakers were disintegrating some abnormally rich auriferous reefs out\r\nat sea, and that the resultant gold was washed up on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe facts are simply, with regard to the rivers, that the winter floods\r\nbreak down the drifts in the banks and agitate the auriferous detritus,\r\nthus acting as natural sluices, and cause the metal to accumulate\r\nin favourable spots; whilst on the New Zealand coast the heavy seas\r\nbreaking on the shingly beach, carry off the lighter particles, leaving\r\nbehind the gold, which is so much heavier. These beaches are composed,\r\nas also are the \"terraces\" behind, of enormous glacial and fluvial\r\ndeposits, all containing more or less gold, and extend inland to the\r\nfoot of the mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that the usually fine gold got by hydraulicing in\r\nCalifornian canyons, in the gullies of the New Zealand Alps, and the\r\ngreat New South Wales drifts, is largely the result of the attrition of\r\nthe boulders and gravel of moraines, which has thus freed, to a certain\r\nextent, the auriferous particles. But when we find large nuggety masses\r\nof high carat gold in the beds of dead rivers, another origin has to be\r\nsought.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, there is fair reason to assume that at least\r\nthree salts of gold have existed, and, possibly, may still be found in\r\nNature--silicate, sulphide, and chloride. All of these are soluble and\r\nin the presence of certain reagents, also existing naturally, can be\r\ndeposited in metallic form. Therefore, if, as is contended, reef\r\ngold was formed with the reefs from solutions in mineral waters, by\r\ninferential reasoning it can be shown that much of our alluvial gold was\r\nsimilarly derived.\r\n\r\nThe commonly accepted theory, however, is that the alluvial matter of\r\nour drifts has been ground out of the solid siliceous lodes by glacial\r\nand fluvial action, and that the auriferous leads have been formed by\r\nthe natural sluicing operations of former streams. To this, however,\r\nthere are several insuperable objections.\r\n\r\nFirst, how comes it that alluvial gold is usually superior in purity to\r\nthe \"reef\" gold immediately adjacent? Second, why is it that masses of\r\ngold, such as the huge nuggets found in Victoria and New South Wales,\r\nhave never been discovered in lodes? Third, how is it that these heavy\r\nmasses which, from their specific gravity, should be found only at the\r\nvery bottom of the drifts, if placed by water action, are sometimes\r\nfound in all positions from the surface to the bottom of the \"wash\"?\r\nAnd, lastly, why is it that when an alluvial lead is traced up to, or\r\ndown from, an auriferous reef, that the light, angular gold lies close\r\nto the roof, while the heavy masses are often placed much farther away?\r\nAny one who has worked a ground sluice knows how extremely difficult it\r\nis with a strong head of water to shift from its position an ounce\r\nof solid gold. What, then, would be the force required to remove the\r\nWelcome Nugget? Under certain circumstances, Niagara would not be equal\r\nto the task.\r\n\r\nThe generally smooth appearance of alleged alluvial gold is adduced\r\nas an argument in favour of its having been carried by water from its\r\noriginal place of deposit, and thus in transit become waterworn; while\r\nsome go so far as to say that it was shot out of the reefs in a molten\r\nstate. The latter idea has been already disposed of, but if not, it may\r\nbe dismissed with the statement that the heat which would melt silica\r\nin the masses met with in lodes would sublimate any gold contained, and\r\ndissipate it, not in nuggets but in fumes. With regard to the assumed\r\nwaterworn appearance of alluvial gold, I have examined with the\r\nmicroscope the smooth surface of more than one apparently waterworn\r\nnugget, and found that it was not scratched and abraded, as would have\r\nbeen the case had it been really waterworn, but that it presented the\r\nsame appearance, though infinitely finer in grain, as the surface of a\r\npiece of metal fresh from the electrical plating-bath.\r\n\r\nMr. Daintree, of the Victorian Geological Survey, many years ago\r\ndiscovered accidentally that gold chloride would deposit its metal on\r\na metallic base in the presence of any organic substance. Mr. Daintree\r\nfound that a piece of undissolved gold in a bottle containing chloride\r\nof gold in solution had, owing to a portion of the cork having fallen\r\ninto the liquid, grown or accretionised so much that it could not be\r\nextracted through the neck. This lead Mr. Charles Wilkinson, who\r\nhas contributed much to our scientific knowledge of metallurgy, to\r\nexperiment further in the same direction. He says: \"Using the most\r\nconvenient salt of gold, the terchloride, and employing wood as the\r\ndecomposing agent, in order to imitate as closely as possible the\r\norganic matter supposed to decompose the solution circulating through\r\nthe drifts, I first immersed a piece of cubic iron pyrites taken from\r\nthe coal formation of Cape Otway, far distant from any of our gold\r\nrocks, and therefore less likely to contain gold than other pyrites. The\r\nspecimen (No. 1) was kept in dilute solution for about three weeks, and\r\nis completely covered with a bright film of gold. I afterwards filed off\r\nthe gold from one side of a cube crystal to show the pyrites itself and\r\nthe thickness of the surrounding coating, which is thicker than ordinary\r\nnotepaper. If the conditions had continued favourable for a very\r\nlengthened period, this specimen would doubtless have formed the nucleus\r\nof a large nugget. Iron, copper, and arsenical pyrites, antimony,\r\ngalena, molybdenite, zinc blende, and wolfram were treated in the above\r\nmanner with similar results. In the above experiments a small chip of\r\nwood was employed as the decomposing agent. In one instance I used a\r\npiece of leather. All through the wood and leather gold was disseminated\r\nin fine particles, and when cut through the characteristic metallic\r\nlustre was brightly reflected. The first six of these sulphides were\r\nalso operated upon simply in the solution without organic matter; but\r\nthey remained unaltered.\"\r\n\r\nWilkinson found that when the solution of gold chloride was as strong\r\nas, say, four grains to the ounce of water, that the pyrites or other\r\nbase began to decompose, and the iron sulphide changed to yellow oxide,\r\nthe \"gossan\" of our lodes, and that though the gold was deposited,\r\nthis occurred in an irregular way, and it was coated with a dark brown\r\npowdery film something like the \"black gold,\" often found in drifts\r\ncontaining much ferruginous matter. Such were the curious Victorian\r\nnuggets Spondulix and Lothair.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newbery also made a number of similar experiments, and arrived\r\nat like results. He states as follows: \"I placed a cube of galena in\r\na solution of chloride of gold, with free access of air, and put in\r\norganic matter; gold was deposited as usual, in a bright metallic film,\r\napparently completely coating the cube. After a few months the film\r\nburst along the edges of the cube, and remained in that state with\r\nthe cracks open without any further alteration in size or form being\r\napparent. Upon removing it a few days ago and breaking it open, I found\r\nthat a large portion of the galena had been decomposed, forming chloride\r\nand sulphate of lead and free sulphur, which were mixed together,\r\nencasing a small nucleus of undecomposed sulphate of lead. The formation\r\nof these salts had exerted sufficient force to burst open the gold\r\ncoating, which upon the outside had the mammillary form noticed by\r\nWilkinson, while the inside was rough and irregular with crystals\r\nforcing their way into the lead salts. Had this action continued\r\nundisturbed, the result would have been a nugget with a nucleus of\r\nlead salts, or if there had been a current to remove the results of\r\ndecomposition, a nugget without a nucleus of foreign matter.\"\r\n\r\nBut Newbery also made another discovery which still further establishes\r\nthe probability of the accretionary growth of gold in drifts. In the\r\nfirst experiments both investigators used organic substances as the\r\nreagent to cause the deposit of gold on its base, and in each case these\r\nsubstances whether woodchips, leather, or even dead flies, were found\r\nto be so absolutely impregnated with gold as to leave a golden skeleton\r\nwhen afterwards burned. Timber found in the Ballarat deep leads has been\r\nproved to be similarly impregnated.\r\n\r\nNewbery found that gold could also be deposited on sulphurets without\r\nany other reagent. He says: \"In our mineral sulphurets, however, we\r\nhave agents which are not only capable of reducing gold and silver from\r\nsolution, but besides are capable of locating them when so reduced in\r\ncoherent and bulky masses. Thus the aggregation of the nuggety forms of\r\ngold from solution becomes a still more simple matter, only one\r\nreagent being necessary, so that there is a greater probability of such\r\ndepositions obtaining than were a double process necessary. Knowing the\r\naction of sulphides, the manner or the mode of formation of a portion at\r\nleast of these nuggets seems apparent. Conceive a stream or river fed\r\nby springs rising in a country intersected by auriferous reefs, and\r\nconsequently in this case carrying gold in solution; the drift of such\r\na country must be to a greater or lesser extent pyritous, so that the\r\n_debris_ forming the beds of these streams or rivers will certainly\r\ncontain nodules of such matters disseminated or even stopping them in\r\nactual contact with the flow of water. It follows, then, from what has\r\nbeen previously affirmed, that there will be a reduction of gold by\r\nthese nodules, and that the metal thus reduced will be firmly attached\r\nto them, at first in minute spangles isolated from each other, but\r\nafterwards accumulating and connecting in a gradual manner at that point\r\nof the pyritous mass most subject to the current until a continuous film\r\nof some size appears. This being formed the pyrites and gold are to a\r\ncertain extent polarised, the film or irregular but connected mass of\r\ngold forming the negative, and the pyrites the positive end of a voltaic\r\npair; and so according as the polarisation is advanced to completion\r\nthe further deposition of gold is changed in its manner from an\r\nindiscriminate to an orderly and selective deposition concentrated\r\nupon the negative or gold plate. The deposition of gold being thus\r\ncontrolled, its loss by dispersion or from the crumbling away of the\r\nsustaining pyrites is nearly or quite prevented, a conservative effect\r\nwhich we could scarcely expect to obtain if organic matter were the\r\nreducing agent. Meanwhile there is a gradual wasting away of the pyrites\r\nor positive pole, its sulphur being oxidised to sulphuric acid and its\r\niron to sesquioxide of iron, or hematite, a substance very generally\r\nassociated with gold nuggets. According to the original size of the\r\npyritous mass, the protection it receives from the action of oxidising\r\nsubstances other than gold, the strength of the gold solution, length of\r\nexposure to it, the rate of supply and velocity of stream, will be the\r\nsize of the gold nugget. As to the size of a pyritous mass necessary to\r\nproduce in this manner a large nugget, it is by no means considerable.\r\nA mass of common pyrites (bisulphide of iron) weighing only 12 lbs.\r\nis competent for the construction of the famous 'Welcome Nugget,' an\r\nAustralian find having weight equal to 152 lbs. avoirdupois. Such masses\r\nof pyrites are by no means uncommon in our drifts or the beds of our\r\nmountain streams. Thus we find that no straining of the imagination is\r\nrequired to conceive of this mode of formation for the huge masses of\r\ngold found in Australia in particular, such as the Welcome Nugget,\r\n184 lbs. 9 oz.; the Welcome Stranger, a surface nugget, 190 lbs. after\r\nsmelting; the Braidwood specimen nugget, 350 lbs., two-thirds gold;\r\nbesides many other large masses of almost virgin gold which have been\r\nobtained from time to time in the alluvial diggings.\"\r\n\r\nThe author has made a number of experiments in the same direction, but\r\nmore with the idea of demonstrating how possibly gold may in certain\r\ncases have been deposited in siliceous formations after such formations\r\nhad solidified. Some of the results were remarkable and indeed\r\nunexpected. I found that I could produce artificial specimens of\r\nauriferous quartz from stone which had previously contained no gold\r\nwhatever, also that it was not absolutely necessary that the stone so\r\ntreated should contain any metallic sulphides.\r\n\r\nThe following was contributed by the author and is from the\r\n\"Transactions\" of the Australasian Institute of Mining Engineers for\r\n1893:--\r\n\r\n\"THE DEPOSITION OF GOLD.\r\n\r\n\"The question as to how gold was originally deposited in our auriferous\r\nlodes is one to which a large amount of attention has been given, both\r\nby mineralogists and practical miners, and which has been hotly argued\r\nby those who held the igneous theory and those who pronounced for the\r\naqueous theory. It was held by the former that as gold was not probably\r\nexistent in nature in any but its metallic form, therefore it had been\r\ndeposited in its siliceous matrix while in a molten state, and many\r\ningenious arguments were adduced in support of this contention. Of late,\r\nhowever, most scientific men, and indeed many purely empirical inquirers\r\n(using the word empirical in its strict sense) have come to the\r\nconclusion that though the mode in which they were composed was not\r\nalways identical, all lodes, including auriferous formations, were\r\nprimarily derived from mineral-impregnated waters which deposited their\r\ncontents in fissures caused either by the cooling of the earth's crust\r\nor by volcanic agency.\r\n\r\n\"The subject is one which has long had a special attraction for the\r\nwriter, who has published several articles thereon, wherein it was\r\ncontended that not only was gold deposited in the lodes from aqueous\r\nsolution, but that some gold found in form of nuggets had not been\r\nderived from lodes but was nascent in its alluvial bed; and for this\r\nproof was afforded by the fact that certain nuggets have been unearthed\r\nhaving the shape of an adjacent pebble or angular fragment of stone\r\nindented in them. Moreover, no true nugget of any great size has ever\r\nbeen found in a lode such as the Welcome, 2159 oz., or the Welcome\r\nStranger, 2280 oz.; while it was accidentally discovered some years ago\r\nthat gold could be induced to deposit itself from its mineral salt to\r\nthe metallic state on any suitable base, such as iron sulphide.\r\n\r\n\"Following out this fact, I have experimented with various salts of\r\ngold, and have obtained some very remarkable results. I have found it\r\npracticable to produce most natural looking specimens of auriferous\r\nquartz from stone which previously, as proved by assay, contained no\r\ngold whatever. Moreover, the gold, which penetrates the stone in a\r\nthorough manner, assumes some of the more natural forms. It is always\r\nmore or less mammillary, but at times, owing to causes which I have not\r\nyet quite satisfied myself upon, is decidedly dendroidal, as may be seen\r\nin one of the specimens which I have submitted to members. Moreover,\r\nI find it possible to moderate the colour and to produce a specimen in\r\nwhich the gold shall be as ruddy yellow as in the ferro-oxide gangue of\r\nMount Morgan, or to tone it to the pale primrose hue of the product of\r\nthe Croydon mines.\r\n\r\n\"I note that the action of the bath in which the stone is treated has a\r\nparticularly disintegrating effect on many of the specimens. Some, which\r\nbefore immersion were of a particularly flinty texture, became in a few\r\nweeks so friable that they could be broken up by the fingers. So far\r\nas my experiments have extended they have proved this, that it was not\r\nessential that the silica and gold should have been deposited at the one\r\ntime in auriferous lodes. A non-auriferous siliceous solution may have\r\nfilled a fissure, and, after solidifying, some volcanic disturbance may\r\nhave forced water impregnated with a gold salt through the interstices\r\nof the lode formation, when, if the conditions were favourable, the gold\r\nwould be deposited in metallic forms. I prefer, for reasons which will\r\nprobably be understood, not to say exactly by what process my results\r\nare obtained, but submit specimens for examination.\r\n\r\n\"(1) Piece of previously non-gold bearing stone. Locality near Adelaide,\r\nnow showing gold freely in mammillary and dendroidal form.\r\n\r\n\"(2) Stone from New South Wales, showing gold artificially introduced in\r\ninterstices and on face.\r\n\r\n\"(3) Stone from West Australia, very glassy looking, now thoroughly\r\nimpregnated with gold; the mammillary formation being particularly\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\n\"(4) Somewhat laminated quartz from Victoria, containing a little\r\nantimony sulphide. In this specimen the gold not only shows on the\r\nsurface but penetrates each of the laminations, as is proved by\r\nbreaking.\r\n\r\n\"(5) Consists of fragments of crystallised carbonate of lime from\r\nTarrawingee, in which the gold is deposited in spots, in appearance like\r\nferrous oxide, until submitted to the magnifying glass.\r\n\r\n\"The whole subject is worthy of much more time than I can possibly give\r\nit. The importance lies in this: That having found how the much desired\r\nmetal may have been deposited in its matrix, the knowledge should help\r\nto suggest how it may be economically extracted therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nA very remarkable nugget weighing 16 3/4 oz. was sluiced from near the\r\nsurface in one of my own mining properties at Woodside, South Australia,\r\nsome years ago, which illustrated the nuclear theory very beautifully.\r\nThis nugget is very irregular in shape, fretted and chased as though\r\nwith a jeweller's graving tool, showing plainly the shape of the\r\npyritous crystals on which it was formed while the interstices were\r\nfilled with red hematite iron just as found in artificially formed\r\nnuggets on a sulphide of iron base. The author has a nugget from the\r\nsame locality weighing about 1 1/2 oz. which exhibits in a marked degree\r\nthe same characteristics, as indeed does most of the alluvial gold\r\nfound in the Mount Lofty Ranges; also a nugget from near the centre\r\nof Australia weighing four ounces, in which the original crystals of\r\npyrites are reproduced in gold just as an iron horse-shoe, placed in\r\na launder through which cupriferously impregnated water flows, will in\r\ntime be changed to nearly pure copper and yet retain its shape.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to the four points I have put as to the apparent\r\nanomalies of occurrence of alluvial gold. The reason why alluvial gold\r\nis of finer quality as a rule than reef is probably because while gold\r\nand silver, which have a considerable affinity for each other, were\r\npresumably dissolved from their salts and held in solution in the same\r\nmineral water, they would in many cases not be deposited together, for\r\nthe reason that silver is most readily deposited in the presence of\r\nalkalies, which would be found in excess in mineral waters coming direct\r\nfrom the basic rocks, while gold is induced to precipitate more quickly\r\nin acid solutions, which would be the character of the waters after\r\nthey had been exposed to atmospheric action and to contact with organic\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThis, then, may explain not only the comparatively greater purity of the\r\nalluvial gold, but also why big nuggets are found so far from auriferous\r\nreefs, and also why heavy masses of gold have been frequently unearthed\r\nfrom among the roots even of living trees, but more particularly in\r\ndrifts containing organic matter, such as ancient timber.\r\n\r\nAll, then, that has been adduced goes to establish the belief that the\r\nbirthplace of our gold is in certain of the earlier rocks comprising the\r\nearth's crust, and that its appearance as the metal we value so highly\r\nis the result of electro-chemical action, such as we can demonstrate in\r\nthe laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nGOLD EXTRACTION\r\n\r\nWe now come to a highly important part of our subject, the practical\r\ntreatment of ores and matrixes for the extraction of the metals\r\ncontained. The methods employed are multitudinous, but may be divided\r\ninto four classes, namely, washing, amalgamating with mercury,\r\nchlorinating, cyaniding and other leaching processes, and smelting. The\r\nfirst is used in alluvial gold and tin workings and in preparing some\r\nsilver, copper, and other ores for smelting, and consists merely in\r\nseparating the heavier metals and minerals from their gangues by their\r\ngreater specific gravity in water. The second includes the trituration\r\nof the gangue and the extraction of its gold or silver by means of\r\nmercury. Chlorinating and leaching generally is a process whereby\r\nmetals are first changed by chemical action into their mineral salts,\r\nas chloride of gold, nitrate of silver, sulphate of copper, and being\r\ndissolved in water are afterwards redeposited in the metallic form by\r\nmeans of well-known re-agents.\r\n\r\nIn really successful mining it is in the last degree important that the\r\nmode of extraction of metals in the most scientific manner should be\r\nthoroughly understood, but as a general rule the science of metallurgy\r\nis but very superficially grasped even by those whose special business\r\nit is to treat ore bodies in order to extract their metalliferous\r\ncontents, and whether in quartz crushing mill, lixiviating, or smelting\r\nworks there is much left to be desired in the method of treating our\r\nores.\r\n\r\nMy attention was recently attracted to an article written by Mr. F. A.\r\nH. Rauft, M.E., from which I make the following extract:\r\n\r\nHe says, speaking of the German treatment of ores and the mode of\r\nprocedure in Australia, \"It is high time that Government stepped in and\r\nendeavoured by prompt and decisive action to bring the mining industry\r\nupon a sound and legitimate basis. Though our ranges abound in all\r\nkinds of minerals that might give employment to hundreds of thousands of\r\npeople, mining is carried on in a desultory, haphazard fashion. There is\r\nno system, and the treatment of ores is of necessity handed over to the\r\ntender mercies of men who have not even an idea of what an intricate\r\nscience metallurgy has become in older countries. During many years of\r\npractical experience I have never known a single instance where a lode,\r\non being worked, gave a return according to assay, and I have never\r\nknown any mine where some of the precious metals could not be found in\r\nthe tailings or slag. The Germans employ hundreds of men in working for\r\nzinc which produces some two or three per cent to the ton; here the same\r\npercentage of tin could hardly be made payable, and this, mark you,\r\nis owing not to cheaper labour alone, but chiefly to the labour-saving\r\nappliances and the results of the researches of such gigantic intellects\r\nas Professor Kerl and many others, of whom we in this country never even\r\nhear. Go into any of the great mining works of central Germany, and you\r\nmay see acres covered by machinery ingeniously constructed to clean,\r\nbreak, and sort, and ultimately deliver the ores into trucks or direct\r\ninto the furnace, and the whole under the supervision of a youngster or\r\ntwo. When a parcel of ore arrives at any of the works, say Freiberg or\r\nClausthal, it is carefully assayed by three or four different persons\r\nand then handed over to practical experts, who are expected to produce\r\nthe full amount of previous metal according to assay; and if by any\r\nchance they do not, a fixed percentage of the loss is deducted from\r\ntheir salary; or, if the result is in excess of this assay which is more\r\nfrequently the case, a small bonus is added to their pay. Compare\r\nthis system with our own wasteful, reckless method of dealing with our\r\nprecious metals, and we may hide our heads in very shame.\"\r\n\r\nAll really practical men will, I think, endorse Mr. Rauft's opinion.\r\nWell organised and conducted schools of mines will gradually ameliorate\r\nthis unsatisfactory state of things, and I hope before long that we\r\nshall have none but qualified certificated men in our mines. In the\r\nmeantime a few practical hints, particularly on that very difficult\r\nbranch of the subject, the saving of gold, will, it is hoped, be found\r\nof service.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of gold from the soil is an industry so old that its\r\nfirst introduction is lost in the mist of ages. As before stated, gold\r\nis one of the most widely disseminated of the metals, and man, so soon\r\nas he had risen from the lowest forms of savagery, began to be attracted\r\nby the kingly metal, which he found to be easily fashioned into articles\r\nof ornament and use, and to be practically non-corrodable.\r\n\r\nWhat we now term the dish or pan, then, doubtless generally a wooden\r\nbowl, was the appliance first used; but they had also an arrangement,\r\nsomewhat like our modern blanket tables, over which the auriferous\r\nsand was passed by means of a stream of water. The sands of some of\r\nthe rivers from which portions of the gold supply of the old world was\r\nderived are still washed over year after year in exactly the same manner\r\nas was employed, probably, thousands of years ago, the labour, very\r\narduous, being often carried on by women, who, standing knee deep in\r\nwater, pan off the sand in wooden bowls much as the digger in modern\r\nalluvial fields does with his tin dish. The resulting gold often\r\nconsists of but a grain or two of fine dust-gold, which is carefully\r\ncollected in quills, and so exported or traded for goods.\r\n\r\nThe digger of to-day having discovered payable alluvial dirt at such a\r\ndepth as to permit of its being profitably worked by small parties of\r\nmen with limited or no capital, procures first a half hogshead for a\r\npuddling tub, a \"cradle,\" or \"long tom,\" and tin dish. The \"wash dirt,\"\r\nas the auriferous drift is usually termed, contains a considerable\r\nadmixture of clay of a more or less tenacious character, and the bulk of\r\nthis has to be puddled and so disintegrated before the actual separation\r\nof the gold is attempted in the cradle or dish. This is done in the\r\ntub by constantly stirring with a shovel, and changing the water as it\r\nbecomes charged with the floating argillaceous, or clayey, particles.\r\nThe gravel is then placed in the hopper of the cradle which separates\r\nthe larger stones and pebbles, the remainder passing down over inclined\r\nledges as the cradle is slowly rocked and supplied with water. At\r\nthe bottom of each ledge is a riffle to arrest the particles of gold.\r\nSometimes, when the gold is very fine, amalgamated copper plates are\r\nintroduced and the lower ledges are covered with green baize to act as\r\nblanket tables and catch gold which might otherwise be lost.\r\n\r\nA long tom is a trough some 12 feet in length by 20 inches in width at\r\nthe upper end, widening to 30 inches at the lower end; it is about 9\r\ninches deep and has a fall of 1 inch to a foot. An iron screen is placed\r\nat the lower end where large stones are caught, and below this screen\r\nis the riffle box, 12 feet long, 3 feet wide, and having the same\r\ninclination as the upper trough. It is fitted with several riffles in\r\nwhich mercury is sometimes placed.\r\n\r\nMuch more work can be done with this appliance than with the cradle,\r\nwhich it superseded. Of course, the gold must be coarse and water\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the claim is paying, and the diggings show signs of some\r\npermanency, a puddling machine is constructed. This is described in the\r\nchapter called \"Rules of Thumb.\"\r\n\r\nHydraulicing and ground sluicing is a very cheap and effective method\r\nof treating large quantities of auriferous drift, and, given favourable\r\ncircumstances, such as a plentiful supply of water with good fall and\r\nextensive loose auriferous deposits, a very few grains to the ton or\r\nload can be made to give payable returns. The water is conveyed in\r\nflumes, or pipes to a point near where it is required, thence in wrought\r\niron pipes gradually reduced in size and ending in a great nozzle\r\nsomewhat like that of a fireman's hose. The \"Monitor,\" as it is\r\nsometimes called, is generally fixed on a movable stand, so arranged\r\nthat the strong jet of water can be directed to any point by a simple\r\nadjustment. A \"face\" is formed in the drift, and the water played\r\nagainst the lower portion of the ledge, which is quickly undermined, and\r\nfalls only to be washed away in the stream of water, which is conducted\r\nthrough sluices with riffles, and sometimes over considerable lengths\r\nof amalgamated copper plates. This class of mining has been most\r\nextensively carried out in California and New Zealand, and some\r\ndistricts of Victoria, but the truly enormous drifts of the Shoalhaven\r\ndistrict in New South Wales must in the near future add largely to the\r\nworld's gold supply. These drifts which are auriferous from grass roots\r\nto bed rock extend for nearly fifty miles, and are in places over 200\r\nfeet deep. Want of capital and want of knowledge has hitherto prevented\r\ntheir being profitably worked on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of reef gold from its matrix is a much more complicated\r\nprocess, and the problem how most effectively to obtain that great\r\ndesideratum--a complete separating and saving operation--is one which\r\ntaxes the skill and evokes the ingenuity of scientific men all over the\r\nworld. The difficulty is that as scarcely any two gangues, or matrixes,\r\nare exactly alike, the treatment which is found most effective on\r\none mine will often not answer in another. Much also depends on the\r\nproportion of gold to the ton of rock under treatment, as the most\r\nscientific and perfect processes of lixiviation hitherto adopted will\r\nnot pay, even when all other conditions are favourable, if the amount of\r\ngold is much under half an ounce to the ton and even then will leave\r\nbut a very small profit. If, however, the gold is \"free,\" and the lode\r\nlarge, a very few pennyweights (or \"dollars,\" as the Americans say) to\r\nthe ton will pay handsomely. The mode of extraction longest in vogue,\r\nand after all the cheapest and most effective, for free milling ores\r\nwhere the gold is not too fine, is amalgamation with mercury, which\r\nmetal has a strong affinity for gold, silver, and copper.\r\n\r\nAs to crushing appliances, I shall not say much. \"Their name is legion\r\nfor they are many,\" and the same may be said of concentrators. It may\r\nbe old-fashioned, but I admit my predilection is still in favour of\r\nthe stamper-battery, for the reason that though it may be slower in\r\nproportion to the power employed, it is simple and not liable to get out\r\nof order, a great advantage when one has so often to depend on men who\r\nbring to their work a supply principally of main strength and stupidity.\r\nFor the same reason I prefer the old draw and lift, and plunger pumps to\r\nnewer but more complicated water-lifters.\r\n\r\nOn both these points, however, I am constrained to admit that my opinion\r\nhas recently been somewhat shaken.\r\n\r\nI have lately seen two appliances which appear to mark a new era in the\r\nscientific progress of mining. One is the \"Griffin Mill,\" the other the\r\n\"Lemichel Siphon Elevateur.\"\r\n\r\nThe first is in some respects on the principle of the Huntingdon Mill.\r\nThe latter, if the inventor may be believed and the results seem to\r\nshow he can be, will be a wonderful factor in developing not only mining\r\nproperties where a preponderance of water is the trouble, but also\r\nin providing an automatic, and therefore extremely cheap, mode of\r\nwater-raising and supply, which in simplicity is thus far unexampled.\r\nAtmospheric pressure alone is relied on. The well-known process of the\r\nsyphon is the basis, but with this essential difference, that a\r\nlarge proportion of the water drawn up to the apex of the syphon is\r\nsuper-elevated to heights regulated by the fall obtained in the outlet\r\nleg. This elevation can be repeated almost indefinitely by returning the\r\nwaste water to the reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThe Lemichel Syphon is a wonderful, yet most simple application of\r\nnatural force. The inlet leg of the syphon is larger in diameter than\r\nthe outlet leg, and is provided at the bottom with a valve or \"clack.\"\r\nThe outlet leg has a tap at its base. At the apex are two chambers, with\r\nan intermediary valve, regulated by a counterpoise weighted lever. The\r\nfirst chamber has also a vertical valve and pipe.\r\n\r\nWhen the tap of the outlet leg is turned, the water flows as in an\r\nordinary syphon, but owing to the rapid automatic opening and shutting\r\nof the valve in the first chamber about 45 per cent of the water is\r\ndiverted, and may be raised to a height of many feet above the top of\r\nthe syphon.\r\n\r\nIt need not be impressed on practical men that if this invention will\r\nperform anything like what is claimed for it, its value can hardly be\r\ncalculated. After a careful inspection of the appliance in operation, I\r\nbelieve it will do all that is stated.\r\n\r\nAnother invention is combined with this which, by a very small\r\nexpenditure of fuel, will enable the first point of atmospheric\r\npressure to be attained. In this way the unwatering of mines may be very\r\ninexpensively effected, or water for irrigation purposes may be raised\r\nfrom an almost level stream.\r\n\r\nThe Griffin Mill is a centrifugal motion crusher with one roller only,\r\nwhich, by an ingenious application of motive force, revolves in an\r\nopposite direction to its initial momentum, and which evolves a force of\r\n6000 lb. against the tire, which is only 30 inches in diameter. For hard\r\nquartz the size should be increased by at least 6 inches. It is claimed\r\nfor this mill that it will pulverise to a gauge of 900 holes to the\r\nsquare inch from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 tons per hour, or, say roughly, 150 tons\r\nper week.\r\n\r\nThe Huntingdon mill is a good crusher and amalgamator where the material\r\nto be operated on is comparatively soft, but does not do such good work\r\nwhen the stone is of a hard flinty nature.\r\n\r\nA No. 4 Dodge stone-breaker working about 8 hours will keep a five-foot\r\nHuntingdon mill going 24 hours, and an automatic feeder is essential.\r\nFor that matter both are almost essential for an ordinary stamper\r\nbattery, and will certainly increase the crushing capacity and do better\r\nwork from the greater regularity of the feed.\r\n\r\nA 10 h.-p. (nominal) engine of good type is sufficient for Huntingdon\r\nmill, rock breaker, self-feeder and steam pump. A five-foot mill under\r\nfavourable circumstances will crush about as much as eight head of\r\nmedium weight stamps.\r\n\r\nThe Grusonwek Ball Mills, made by Krupp of Germany, also that made by\r\nthe Austral Otis Company, Melbourne, are fast and excellent crushing\r\ntriturating appliances for either wet or dry working, but are specially\r\nsuited only for ores when the gold is fine and evenly distributed in\r\nthe stone. The trituration is effected by revolving the stone in a large\r\ncylinder together with a number of steel balls of various sizes, the\r\nattrition of which with the rock quickly grinds it to powder of any\r\nrequired degree of fineness.\r\n\r\nMore mines have been ruined by bad mill management probably than by bad\r\nmining, though every experienced man must have seen in his time many\r\nmost flagrant instances of bungling in the latter respect. Shafts are\r\noften sunk on the wrong side of the lode or too near or too far away\r\ntherefrom, while instances have not been wanting where the (mis) manager\r\nhas, after sinking his shaft, driven in the opposite direction to that\r\nwhere the lode should be found.\r\n\r\nA common error is that of erecting machinery before there is sufficient\r\nore in sight to make it certain that enough can be provided to keep the\r\nplant going. In mines at a distance from the centre of direction it is\r\nalmost impossible to check mistakes of this description, caused by the\r\nignorance or over sanguineness of the mine superintendent, and they are\r\noften as disastrous as they are indefensible. Another fertile source of\r\nfailure is the craze for experimenting with untried inventions, alleged\r\nto be improvements on well-known methods.\r\n\r\nA rule in the most scientific of card games, whist, is \"when in doubt\r\nlead trumps.\" It might be paraphrased for mining thus: \"When in doubt\r\nabout machinery use that which has been proved.\" Let some one else do\r\nthe experimenting.\r\n\r\nThe success of a quartz mine depends as much on favourable working\r\nconditions as on its richness in gold. Thus it may be that a mine\r\ncarrying 5 or 6 oz. of gold to the ton but badly circumstanced as to\r\ndistance, mountainous roads, lack of wood and water, in some cases a\r\nplethora of the latter, or irregularly faulted country, may be less\r\nprofitable than another showing only 5 or 6 dwt., but favourably\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nIt is usually desirable to choose for the battery site, when possible,\r\nthe slope of a hill which consists of rock that will give a good\r\nfoundation for your battery.\r\n\r\nThe economical working depends greatly on the situation, which is\r\ngenerally fixed more or less, in the proximity of the water. The\r\nadvantages of having ample water for battery purposes, or of using\r\nwater as a motive power, are so great that it is very often desirable\r\nto construct a tramway of considerable length, when, by so doing, that\r\npower can be utilised; hence most quartz mills are placed near streams,\r\nor in valleys where catchment dams can be effectively constructed,\r\nexcept, of course, in districts where much water has to be pumped from\r\nthe mine.\r\n\r\nIf water-power can be used, the water-motor will necessarily be placed\r\nas low as possible, in order to obtain the fullest available power. One\r\npoint is essential. Special care must be taken to keep the appliances\r\nabove the flood-level. If the water in the stream is not sufficient to\r\ncarry off the tailings, the battery should be placed at such a height\r\nas to leave sufficient slope for tailings' dumps. This is more important\r\nwhen treating ore of such value that the tailings are worth saving for\r\nsecondary treatment. In this case provision should be made for tailings,\r\ndams, or slime pits.\r\n\r\nWhether the battery is worked by water, steam, or gas power, an ample\r\nsupply of water is absolutely necessary, at least until some thoroughly\r\neffective mode of dry treatment is established. If it can be possibly\r\narranged the water should be brought in by gravitation, and first cost\r\nis often least cost; but where this is impossible, pumps of sufficient\r\ncapacity, not only to provide the absolute quantity used, but to meet\r\nany emergency, should be erected.\r\n\r\nThe purer the water the better it will be for amalgamating purposes, and\r\nin cold climates it is desirable to make provision for heating the water\r\nsupplied to the battery. This can be done by means of steam from the\r\nboiler led through the feed tanks; but where the boiler power is not\r\nmore than required, waste steam from the engine may be employed, but\r\ncare must be taken that no greasy matter comes in contact with the\r\nplates. The exhaust steam from the engine may be utilised by carrying it\r\nthrough tubes fitted in an ordinary 400 gallon tank.\r\n\r\nReducing appliances have often to be placed in districts where the water\r\nsupply is insufficient for the battery. When this is so every available\r\nmeans must be adopted for saving the precious liquid, such as condensing\r\nthe exhaust steam from the engine. This may be done by conducting it\r\nthrough a considerable length of ordinary zinc piping, such as is used\r\nfor carrying the water from house roofs. Also tailings pits should be\r\nmade, in which the tailings and slimes are allowed to settle, and the\r\ncleared water is pumped back to be again used. These pits should, where\r\npracticable, be cemented. It is usual, also, to have one or two tailings\r\ndams at different levels; the tailings are run into the upper dam, and\r\nare allowed to settle; the slimes overflow from it into the lower dam,\r\nand are there deposited, while the cleared water is pumped back to the\r\nbattery. Arrangements are made by which all these reservoirs can be\r\nsluiced out when they are filled with accumulated tailings. It is well\r\nnot to leave the sluicing for too long a period, as when the slimes and\r\ntailings are set hard they are difficult to remove.\r\n\r\nWhere a permanent reducing plant is to be erected, whatever form of\r\nmill may be adopted, it is better for many reasons to use automatic\r\nore feeders. Of these the best two I have met are the \"Tulloch\" and\r\n\"Challenge\" either of which can be adapted to any mill and both do good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBy their use the reducing capacity of the mill is increased, and the\r\nfeeding being regular the wear and tear is decreased, while by the\r\nregulated feeding of the \"pulp\" in the battery box or mortar can be\r\nmaintained at any degree of consistency which may be found desirable,\r\nand thus the process of amalgamation will be greatly facilitated. The\r\nonly objection which can be urged against the automatic feeder is that\r\nthe steel points of picks, gads, drills, and other tools may be allowed\r\nto pass into the mortar or mill, and thus cause considerable wear\r\nand tear. This, I think, can be avoided by the adoption of the magnet\r\ndevice, described in \"Rules of Thumb.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many mines where 3 to 4 dwt. of gold cover all the cost, the\r\nexcess being clear profit. In fact there are mines which with a yield\r\nof 1 1/2 to 2 dwt. a ton, and crushing with water power, have actually\r\nyielded large profits. On the other hand, mines which have given\r\nextraordinary trial crushings have not paid working expenses. Everything\r\ndepends on favourable local conditions and proper management.\r\n\r\nHaving decided what class of crushing machinery you will adopt, the\r\nfirst point is to fix on the best possible site for its erection. This\r\nrequires much judgment, as success or failure may largely depend on\r\nthe position of your machinery. One good rule is to get your crusher as\r\nreasonably high as possible, as it is cheaper to pump your feed water\r\na few feet higher so as to get a good clear run for your tailings, and\r\nalso to give you room to erect secondary treatment appliances, such\r\nas concentrators and amalgamators below your copper plates and blanket\r\nstrakes.\r\n\r\nNext, and this is most important, see that your foundations are solid\r\nand strong. A very large number of the failures of quartz milling plants\r\nis due to neglect of this rule.\r\n\r\nI once knew a genius who erected a 10-Lead mill in a new district, and\r\nwho adopted the novel idea of placing a \"bed log\" laterally beneath\r\nhis stampers. The log was laid in a little cement bed which, when the\r\nbattery started, was not quite dry. The effect was comical to every one\r\nbut the unfortunate owners. It was certainly the liveliest, but at the\r\nsame time one of the most ineffective batteries I have seen.\r\n\r\nIn a stamp mill the foundations are usually made of hard wood logs about\r\n5 to 6 feet long, set on end, the bottom end resting on rock and set\r\nround with cement concrete. These are bolted together, and the \"box\" or\r\nmortar is bolted to them. The horizontal logs to carry the \"horses\" or\r\nsupports for the battery frame should also be of good size, and solidly\r\nand securely bolted. The same applies to your engine-bed, but whether it\r\nbe of timber, or mason work, above all things provide that the whole of\r\nyour work is set out square and true to save after-wear and friction.\r\n\r\nConsiderable difference of opinion exists as to the most effective\r\nweight for stamps. My experience has been that this largely depends on\r\nthe nature of your rock, as does also the height for the drop. I have\r\nusually found that with medium stamps, say 7 to 7 1/2 cwt. with fair\r\ndrop and lively action, about 80 falls per minute, the best results were\r\nobtained, but the tendency of modern mill men is towards the heavier\r\nstamps, 9 cwt. and even heavier.\r\n\r\nTo find the horse-power required to drive a battery, multiply the weight\r\nof one stamp by the number of stamps in the battery; the height of lift\r\nin feet by the number of lifts per minute; add one-third of the product\r\nfor friction, and the result will be the number of feet-lbs. per minute;\r\ndivide this by 33,000 which is the number of feet-lbs. per minute equal\r\nto 1 h.-p. and the result will be the h.-p. required. Thus if a stamp\r\nweighs 800 lb. and you have five in the box, and each stamp has a lift\r\nof 9 in. = 0.75 ft. and strikes 80 blows per minute, then 800 x 5 x 0.75\r\nx 80 = 240,000; one-third of 240,000 = 80,000 which added to 240,000\r\n= 320,000; and 320,000 divided by 33,000 = 9.7 h.-p. or 1.9 h.-p. each\r\nstamp.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of a battery, including stamper box, stampers, etc.,\r\nmay be roughly estimated at about 1 ton per stamp. Medium weight\r\nstampers, including shank cam, disc, head, and shoe, weigh from 600 to\r\n700 lb., and need about 3/4 h.-p. to work them.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of water required for the effective treatment of\r\ngold-bearing rock in a stamper battery varies according to the\r\ncomposition of the material to be operated upon, but generally it is\r\nmore than the inexperienced believe. For instance, \"mullocky\" lode\r\nstuff, containing much clayey matter or material carrying a large\r\npercentage of heavy metal, such as titanic iron or metallic sulphides,\r\nwill need a larger quantity of water per stamp than clean quartz. A fair\r\naverage quantity would be 750 to 1000 gallons per hour for each box of\r\nfive stamps. In general practice I have seldom found 1000 gallons per\r\nhour more than sufficient.\r\n\r\nAs to the most effective mesh for the screen or grating no definite\r\nrule can be given, as that depends so largely on the size of the gold\r\nparticles contained in the gangue. The finer the particles the closer\r\nmust be the mesh, and nothing but careful experiment will enable the\r\nbattery manager to decide this most important point. The American\r\nslotted screens are best; they wear better than the punched gratings and\r\ncan be used of finer gauge. Woven steel wire gauze is employed with good\r\neffect in some mills where especially fine trituration is required. This\r\nclass of screen requires special care as it is somewhat fragile, but\r\nwith intelligent treatment does good work.\r\n\r\nThe fall or inclination of the tables, both copper and blanket strakes,\r\nis also regulated by the class of ore. If it should be heavy then the\r\nfall must be steeper. A fair average drop is 3/4 inch to the foot. Be\r\ncareful that your copper tables are thoroughly water-tight, for remember\r\nyou are dealing with a very volatile metal, quicksilver; and where water\r\nwill percolate mercury will penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe blanket tables are simply a continuation of the mercury tables, but\r\ncovered with strips of coarse blanket, green baize, or other flocculent\r\nmaterial, intended to arrest the heavier metallic particles which, owing\r\nto their refractory nature, have not been amalgamated.\r\n\r\nThe blanket table is, however, a very unsatisfactory concentrator\r\nat best, and is giving place to mechanical concentrators of various\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nAn ancient Egyptian gold washing table was used by the Egyptians in\r\ntreating the gold ores of Lower Egypt. The ore was first ground, it is\r\nlikely by means of some description of stone arrasts and then passed\r\nover the sloping table with water, the gold being retained in the\r\nriffles. In these the material would probably be mechanically agitated.\r\nAlthough for its era ingenious it will be plain to practical men that if\r\nthe gold were fine the process would be very ineffective. Possibly, but\r\nof this I have no evidence, mercury was used to retain the gold on the\r\nriffles, as previously stated. This method of saving the precious metal\r\nwas known to the ancients.\r\n\r\nAt a mine of which I was managing director the lode was almost entirely\r\ncomposed of sulphide of iron, carbonate of lime or calcspar, with a\r\nlittle silica. In this case it has been found best to crush without\r\nmercury, then run the pulp into pans, where it is concentrated. The\r\nconcentrates are calcined in a common reverberatory furnace, and\r\nafterwards amalgamated with mercury in a special pan, the results as to\r\nthe proportion of gold extracted being very satisfactory; but it does\r\nnot therefore follow that this process would be the most suitable in\r\nanother mine where the lode stuff, though in some respects similar, yet\r\nhad points of difference.\r\n\r\nI was lately consulted with respect to the treatment of a pyritic ore\r\nin a very promising mine, but could not recommend the above treatment,\r\nbecause though the pyrites in the gangue was similar, the bulk of the\r\nlode consisted of silica, consequently there would be a great waste of\r\npower in triturating the whole of the stuff to what, with regard to much\r\nof it, would be an unnecessary degree of fineness. I am of opinion\r\nthat in cases such as this, where it is not intended to adopt the\r\nchlorination or cyanogen process, it will be found most economical to\r\ncrush to a coarse gauge, concentrate, calcine the concentrates, and\r\nfinally amalgamate in some suitable amalgamator.\r\n\r\nProbably for this mode of treatment Krom rolls would be found more\r\neffective reducing agents than stampers, as with them the bulk of the\r\nore can be broken to any required gauge and there would consequently be\r\nless loss in \"slimes.\"\r\n\r\nThe great art in effective battery work is to crush your stuff to\r\nthe required fineness only, and then to provide that each particle is\r\nbrought into contact with the mercury either in box, trough, plate, or\r\npan. To do this the flow of water must be carefully regulated; neither\r\nso much must be used as to carry the stuff off too quickly nor so little\r\nas to cause the troughs and plates to choke. In cold weather the water\r\nmay be warmed by passing the feed-pipe through a tank into which the\r\nsteam from the engine exhausts, and this will be found to keep the\r\nmercury bright and lively. But be careful no engine oil or grease\r\nmingles with the water, as grease on the copper tables will absolutely\r\nprevent amalgamation.\r\n\r\nThe first point, then, is to crush the gangue effectively, the degree of\r\nfineness being regulated by the fineness of the gold itself. This being\r\ndone, then comes the question of saving the gold. If the quartz be\r\nclean, and the gold unmixed with base metal, the difficulty is small.\r\nAll that is required is to ensure that each particle of the Royal metal\r\nshall be brought into contact with the mercury. The main object is to\r\narrest the gold at the earliest possible stage; therefore, if you are\r\ntreating clean stone containing free gold, either coarse or fine,\r\nI advise the use of mercury in the boxes, for the reason that a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the gold will be caught thereby, and settling\r\nto the bottom, or adhering to amalgamated plates in the boxes, where\r\nsuch are used, will not be afterwards affected by the crushing action,\r\nwhich might otherwise break up, or \"flour,\" the mercury. On the whole, I\r\nrather favour the use of mercury in the box at any time, unless the ore\r\nis very refractory--that is, contains too great a proportion of base\r\nmetals, particularly sulphides of iron, arsenic, etc., when the result\r\nwill not be satisfactory, but may entail great loss by the escape of\r\nfloured mercury carrying with it particles of gold. Here only educated\r\nintelligence, with experience, will assist the battery manager to adopt\r\nthe right system.\r\n\r\nThe crushed stuff--generally termed the \"pulp\"--passes from the boxes\r\nthrough the \"screens\" or \"gratings,\" and so on to the \"tables\"--i.e.,\r\nsheets of copper amalgamated on the upper surface with mercury, and\r\nsometimes electroplated with silver and afterwards treated with mercury.\r\nUnless the quartz is very clean, and, consequently light, I am opposed\r\nto the form of stamper box with mercury troughs cast in the \"lip,\" nor\r\ndo I think that a trough under the lip is a good arrangement, as it\r\nusually gets so choked and covered with the heavy clinging base metals\r\nas to make it almost impossible for the gold to come in contact with the\r\nmercury. It will be found better where the gold is fine, or the gangue\r\ncontains much base metal, to run the pulp from the lip of the battery\r\ninto a \"distributor.\"\r\n\r\nThe distributor is a wooden box the full width of the \"mortar,\" having\r\na perforated iron bottom set some three to four inches above the first\r\ncopper plate, which should come up under the lip. The effect of this\r\narrangement is that the pulp is dashed on the plate by the falling\r\nwater, and the gold at once coming in contact with the mercury begins\r\nto accumulate and attract that which follows, till the amalgam becomes\r\npiled in little crater-shaped mounds, and thus 75 per cent of the gold\r\nis saved on the top plate.\r\n\r\nI have tried a further adaptation of this process when treating ores\r\ncontaining a large percentage of iron oxide, where the bulk of the gold\r\nis impalpably fine, and contained in the \"gossan.\" At the end of the\r\nblanket table, or at any point where the crushed stuff last passes\r\nbefore going to the \"tailings heap,\" or \"sludge pit,\" a \"saver\" is\r\nplaced. The saver is a strong box about 15 in. square by 3 ft. high,\r\none side of which is removable, but must fit tight. Nine slots are cut\r\ninside at 4 in. apart, and into these are fitted nine square perforated\r\ncopper plates, having about eighty to a hundred 1/4 in. holes in each;\r\nthe perforations should not come opposite each other. These plates are\r\nto be amalgamated on both sides with mercury, in which a very little\r\nsodium has been placed (if acid ores are being treated, zinc should be\r\nemployed in place of sodium, and to prevent the plates becoming bare, if\r\nthe stuff is very poor, thick zinc amalgam may be used with good effect;\r\nbut in that case discontinue the sodium, and occasionally, if required,\r\nsay once or twice in the day, mix an ounce of sulphuric acid in a\r\nquart of water and slowly pour it into the launder above the saver).\r\nUnderneath the \"saver\" you require a few riffles, or troughs, to catch\r\nany waste mercury, but if not overfed there should be no waste. This\r\nsimple appliance, which is automatic and requires little attention, will\r\nsometimes arrest a considerable quantity of gold.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the subsidiary processes of battery work, the \"cleaning\"\r\nof plates, and \"scaling\" same when it is desired to get all the gold\r\noff them, the cleaning and retorting of amalgam, and of the mercury,\r\nsmelting gold, etc.\r\n\r\nPlates should be tenderly treated, kept as smooth as possible, and when\r\ncleaning up after crushing, in your own battery, the amalgam--except,\r\nsay, at half-yearly intervals--should be removed with a rubber only; the\r\nrubber is simply a square of black indiarubber or soft pine wood.\r\n\r\nWhen crushing rich ore, and you want to get nearly all the gold off your\r\nplates, the scraper may be resorted to. This is usually made by the mine\r\nblacksmith from an old flat file which is cut in half, the top turned\r\nover, beaten out to a sharp blade, and kept sharp by touching it up on\r\nthe grinding-stone. This, if carefully used, will remove the bulk of the\r\namalgam without injury to the plate.\r\n\r\nVarious methods of \"scaling\" plates will be found among \"Rules of\r\nThumb.\"\r\n\r\nWhere base metals are present in the lode stuff frequent retortings of\r\nthe mercury, say not less than once a month, will be found to have a\r\ngood effect in keeping it pure and active. For this purpose, and\r\nin order to prevent stoppage of the machinery, a double quantity is\r\nnecessary, so that half may be used alternately. Less care is required\r\nin retorting the mercury than in treating the amalgam, as the object\r\nin the one case is more to cleanse the metal of impurities than to save\r\ngold, which will for the most part have been extracted by squeezing\r\nthrough the chamois leather or calico. A good strong heat may therefore\r\nat once be applied to the retort and continued, the effect being to\r\noxidise the arsenic, antimony, lead, etc., which, in the form of oxides,\r\nwill not again amalgamate with the mercury, but will either lie on\r\nits surface under the water, into which the nozzle of the retort is\r\ninserted, or will float away on the surface of the water. I have also\r\nfound that covering the top of the mercury with a few inches of broken\r\ncharcoal when retorting has an excellent purifying effect.\r\n\r\nIn retorting amalgam, much care and attention is required.\r\n\r\nFirst, never fill the retort too full, give plenty of room for\r\nexpansion; for, when the heat is applied, the amalgam will rise like\r\ndough in an oven, and may be forced into the discharge pipe, the\r\nconsequence being a loss of amalgam or the possible bursting of the\r\nretort. Next, be careful in applying the heat, which should be done\r\ngradually, commencing at the top. This is essential to prevent waste and\r\nto turn out a good-looking cake of gold, which all battery managers like\r\nto do, even if they purpose smelting into bars.\r\n\r\nSometimes special difficulties crop up in the process of separating the\r\ngold from the amalgam. At the first \"cleaning up\" on the Frasers Mine at\r\nSouthern Cross, West Australia, great consternation was excited by the\r\nappearance of the retorted gold, which, as an old miner graphically\r\nput it, was \"as black as the hind leg of a crow,\" and utterly unfit for\r\nsmelting, owing to the presence of base metals. Some time after this I\r\nwas largely interested in the Blackborne mine in the same district when\r\na similar trouble arose. This I succeeded in surmounting, but a still\r\nmore serious one was too much for me--i.e., the absence of payable\r\ngold in the stone. I give here an extract from the _Australian Mining\r\nStandard_, of December 9th, 1893, with reference to the mode of cleaning\r\nthe amalgam which I adopted.\r\n\r\nNEW METHOD OF SEPARATING GOLD FROM IMPURE AMALGAM.\r\n\r\nI had submitted to me lately a sample of amalgam from a mine in West\r\nAustralia which amalgam had proved a complete puzzle to the manager\r\nand amalgamator. The Mint returns showed a very large proportion\r\nof impurity, even in the smelted gold. When retorted only, the Mint\r\nauthorities refused to take it after they had treated two cakes, one of\r\n119 oz., which yielded only 35 oz. 5 dwt. standard gold, and one of 140\r\noz., which gave 41 oz. 10 dwt. The gold smelted on the mine was nearly\r\nas bad proportionately. Thus, 128 oz. smelted down at the Mint to 87 oz.\r\n8 dwt. and 109 oz. to 55 oz. 10 dwt. The impurity was principally\r\niron, a most unusual thing in my experience, and was due to two causes\r\nrevealed by assay of the ore and analysis of the mine water, viz.,\r\nan excess of arsenate of iron in the stone, and the presence in large\r\nproportions of mineral salts, principally chloride of Calcium CaCl.,\r\nsodium NaCl, and magnesium MgCl2, in the mine water used in the battery.\r\nThe exact analysis of the water was as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Carbonate of Iron         FeCO3        2.76 grains per gallon\r\n     Carbonate of Calcium      CaCO3        7.61 grains per gallon\r\n     Sulphate of Calcium       CaSO4       81.71 grains per gallon\r\n     Chloride of Calcium       CaCl2     2797.84 grains per gallon\r\n     Chloride of Magnesium     MgCl2      610.13 grains per gallon\r\n     Chloride of Sodium or\r\n     Common Salt            NaCl      5072.65 grains per gallon\r\n\r\n     Total solid matter         8572.70 = 19.5 oz. to the gallon.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that this water is nearly four times more salt\r\nthat that of the sea. The effect of using a water of this character, as\r\nI have previously found, is to cause the amalgamation of considerable\r\nquantities of iron with the gold as in this case.\r\n\r\nI received 10 oz. of amalgam, and having found what constituted its\r\nimpurities proceeded to experiment as to its treatment. When retorted on\r\nthe mine it was turned out in a black cake so impure as almost to\r\nmake it impossible to smelt properly. I found the same result on\r\nfirst retorting, and after a number of experiments which need not be\r\nrecapitulated though some were fairly effective, I hit on the following\r\nmethod, which was found to be most successful and will probably be\r\nso found in other localities where similarly unfavourable conditions\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nI took a small ball of amalgam, placed it in a double fold of new fine\r\ngrained calico, and after soaking in hot water put it under a powerful\r\npress. The weight of the ball before pressing was 1583 gr. From this\r\n383 gr. of mercury was expressed and five-eighths of a grain of gold\r\nwas retorted from this expressed mercury. The residue, in the form of a\r\ndark, grey, and very friable cake, was powdered up between the fingers\r\nand retorted, when it became a brown powder; it was afterwards calcined\r\non a flat sheet in the open air; result, 510 gr. of russet-coloured\r\npowder. Smelted with borax, the iron oxide readily separated with the\r\nslag; result, 311 gr. gold 871-1000 fine; a second smelting brought this\r\nup to 914-1000 fine. Proportion of smelted gold to amalgam, one-fifth.\r\n\r\nThe principal point about this mode of treatment is the squeezing out\r\nof the mercury, whereby the amalgam goes into the retort in the form of\r\npowder, thus preventing the slagging of the iron and enclosure of\r\nthe gold. The second point of importance is thorough calcining before\r\nsmelting.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be practicable, if desired, to treat the powder with\r\nhydrochloric acid, and thus remove all the iron, but in a large way this\r\nwould be too expensive, and my laboratory treatment, though necessarily\r\non a small scale, was intended to be on a practical basis.\r\n\r\nThe amalgam at this mine was in this way afterwards treated with great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nFor the information of readers who do not understand the chemical\r\nsymbols it may be said that\r\n\r\n     FeCO3 is carbonate of iron;\r\n     CaCO3 is carbonate of calcium;\r\n     CaSO4 is sulphate of calcium;\r\n     CaCl2 is chloride of calcium;\r\n     MgCl2 is chloride of magnesium;\r\n     NaCl is chloride of sodium, or common salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nGOLD EXTRACTION--SECONDARY PROCESSES AND LIXIVIATION\r\n\r\nBefore any plan is adopted for treating the ore in a new mine the\r\nmanagement should very seriously and carefully consider the whole\r\ncircumstances of the case, taking into account the quantity and quality\r\nof the lode stuff to be operated on, and ascertain by analysis what are\r\nits component parts, for, as before stated, the treatment which will\r\nyield most satisfactory results with a certain class of gangue on one\r\nmine will sometimes, even when the material is apparently similar, prove\r\na disastrous failure in another. Some time since I was glad to note that\r\nthe manager of a prominent mine strongly discountenanced the purchase of\r\nany extracting plant until he was fully satisfied as to the character\r\nof the bulk of the ore he would have to treat. It would be well for the\r\npockets of shareholders and the reputation of managers, if more of our\r\nmine superintendents followed this prudent and sensible course.\r\n\r\nHaving treated on gold extraction with mercury by amalgamated plates\r\nand their accessories, something must be said about secondary modes\r\nof saving in connection with the amalgamation process. The operations\r\ndescribed hitherto have been the disintegration of the gold-bearing\r\nmaterial and the extraction therefrom of the coarser free gold. But it\r\nmust be understood that most auriferous lode stuff contains a proportion\r\nof sulphides of various metals, wherein a part of the gold, usually in a\r\nvery finely divided state, is enclosed, and on this gold the mercury has\r\nno influence. Also many lodes contain hard heavy ferric ores, such as\r\ntitanic iron, tungstate of iron, and hematite, in which gold is held.\r\nIn others, again, are found considerable quantities of soft powdery iron\r\noxide or \"gossan,\" and compounds such as limonite, aluminous clay, etc.,\r\nwhich, under the action of the crushing mill become finely divided and\r\nfloat off in water as \"slimes,\" carrying with them atoms of gold, often\r\nmicroscopically small. To save the gold in such matrixes as these is an\r\noperation which even the best of our mechanical appliances have not yet\r\nfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhere there is not too great a proportion of base metals on which the\r\nsolvent will act, and when the material is rich enough in gold to pay\r\nfor the extra cost of treatment, chlorination or cyanisation are the\r\nbest modes of extraction yet practically adopted.\r\n\r\nPresuming, however, that we are working by the amalgamation process, and\r\nhave crushed our stone and obtained the free gold, the next requirement\r\nis an effective concentrator. Of these there are many before the\r\npublic, and some do excellent work, but do not act equally well in\r\nall circumstances. The first and most primitive is the blanket table,\r\npreviously mentioned; but it can hardly be said to be very effective,\r\nand requires constant attention and frequent changing and washing of the\r\nstrips of blanket.\r\n\r\nInstead of blanket tables percussion tables are sometimes used, to which\r\na jerking motion is given against the flow of the water and pulp, and by\r\nthis means the heavier minerals are gathered towards the upper part of\r\nthe table, and are from thence removed from time to time as they become\r\nconcentrated.\r\n\r\nI have seen this appliance doing fairly good work, but it is by no means\r\na perfect concentrator.\r\n\r\nAnother form of \"shaking table\" is one in which the motion is given\r\nsideways, and this, whether amalgamated, or provided with small riffles,\r\nor covered with blanket, keeps the pulp lively and encourages the\r\nretention of the heavier particles, whether of gold or base metals\r\ncontaining gold. There has also been devised a rocking table the action\r\nof which is analogous to that of the ordinary miner's cradle. This\r\nappliance, working somewhat slowly, swings on rockers from side to side,\r\nand is usually employed in mills where, owing to the complexity of the\r\nore, difficulties have been met with in amalgamating the gold. Riffles\r\nare provided and even very fine gold is sometimes effectively recovered\r\nby their aid.\r\n\r\nThe Frue vanner will, as a rule, act well when the pulp is sufficiently\r\nfine. It is really a adaptation of an old and simple apparatus used\r\nin China and India for washing gold dust from the sands of rivers. The\r\noriginal consisted of an endless band of strong cloth or closely woven\r\nmatting, run on two horizontal rollers placed about seven feet apart,\r\none being some inches lower than the other. The upper is caused to\r\nrevolve by means of a handle. The cloth is thus dragged upwards against\r\na small stream of water and sand fed to it by a second man, the first\r\nman not only turning the handle but giving a lateral motion to the band\r\nby means of a rope tied to one side.\r\n\r\nChinamen were working these forerunners of the Frue vanner forty years\r\nago in Australia, and getting fair returns.\r\n\r\nThe Frue vanner is an endless indiarubber band drawn over an inclined\r\ntable, to which a revolving and side motion is given by ingenious\r\nautomatic mechanism, the pulp being automatically fed from the upper\r\nend, and the concentrates collected in a trough containing water in\r\nwhich the band is immersed in its passage under the table; the lighter\r\nparticles wash over the lower end. The only faults with the vanner\r\nare--first, it is rather slow; and secondly, though so ingenious it is\r\njust a little complicated in construction for the average non-scientific\r\noperative.\r\n\r\nOf pan concentrators there is an enormous selection, the principle in\r\nmost being similar--i.e., a revolving muller, which triturates the sand,\r\nso freeing the tiny golden particles and admitting of their contact with\r\nthe mercury. The mistake with respect to most of these machines is the\r\nattempt to grind and amalgamate in one operation. Even when the stone\r\nunder treatment contains no deleterious compounds the simple action\r\nof grinding the hard siliceous particles has a bad effect on the\r\nquicksilver, causing it to separate into small globules, which either\r\noxidising or becoming coated with the impurities contained in the ore\r\nwill not reunite, but wash away in the slimes and take with them a\r\npercentage of the gold. As a grinder and concentrator, and in some cases\r\nas an amalgamator, when used exclusively for either purpose, the Watson\r\nand Denny pan is effective; but although successfully used at one mine\r\nI know, the mode there adopted would, for reasons previously given, be\r\nvery wasteful in many other mines.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable misconception, even among men with some practical\r\nknowledge, as to the proper function of these secondary saving\r\nappliances; and sometimes good machines are condemned because they will\r\nnot perform work for which they were never intended. It cannot be too\r\nclearly realized that the correct order of procedure for extracting the\r\ngold held in combination with base metals is--first, reduction of the\r\nparticles to a uniform gauge and careful concentration only; next,\r\nthe dissipation, usually by simple calcination, of substances in the\r\nconcentrates inimical to the thorough absorption of the gold by the\r\nmercury; and lastly, the amalgamation of the gold and mercury.\r\n\r\nFor general purposes, where the gangue has not been crushed too fine,\r\nI think the Duncan pan will usually be found effective in saving the\r\nconcentrates. In theory it is an enlargement of the alluvial miner's tin\r\ndish, and the motion imparted to it is similar to the eccentric motion\r\nof that simple separator.\r\n\r\nThe calcining may be effectively carried out in an ordinary\r\nreverberatory furnace, the only skill required being to prevent over\r\nroasting and so slagging the concentrates; or not sufficiently calcining\r\nso as to remove all deleterious constituents; the subject, however, is\r\nfully treated in Chapter VIII.\r\n\r\nFor amalgamating I prefer some form of settler to any further grinding\r\nappliance, but I note also improvements in the rotary amalgamating\r\nbarrel, which, though slow, is, under favourable conditions, an\r\neffective amalgamator. The introduction of steam under pressure into an\r\niron cylinder containing a charge of concentrates with mercury is said\r\nto have produced good results, and I am quite prepared to believe such\r\nwould be the case, as we have long known that the application of steam\r\nto ores in course of amalgamation facilitates the process considerably.\r\n\r\nSome seventeen years since I was engaged on the construction of a dry\r\namalgamator in which sublimated mercury was passed from a retort through\r\nthe descending gangue in a vertical cylinder, the material thence\r\nfalling through an aperture into a revolving settler, the object being\r\nto save water on mines in dry country. The model, about quarter size,\r\nwas completed when my attention was called to an American invention,\r\nin which the same result was stated to be attained more effectively by\r\nblowing the mercury spray through the triturated material by means of\r\na steam jet. I had already encountered a difficulty, since found so\r\nobstructive by experimentalists in the same direction, that is,\r\nthe getting of the mercury back into its liquid metallic form. This\r\ndifficulty I am now convinced can be largely obviated by my own device\r\nof using a very weak solution of sulphuric acid (it can hardly be\r\ntoo weak) and adding a small quantity of zinc to the mercury. It is\r\nperfectly marvellous how some samples of mercury \"sickened\" or \"floured\"\r\nby bad treatment, may be brought back to the bright limpid metal by a\r\njudicious use of these inexpensive materials.\r\n\r\nThus it will probably be found practicable to crush dry and amalgamate\r\nsemi-dry by passing the material in the form of a thin pasty mass to a\r\nsettler, as in the old South American arrastra, and, by slowly stirring,\r\nrecover the mercury, and with it the bulk of the gold.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Australian Mining Standard_, and was headed\r\n\"Amalgamation Without Overflow\":\r\n\r\n\"Recent experiments at the Ballarat School of Mines have proved that a\r\ndeliverance from difficulties is at hand from an unexpected quarter.\r\nThe despised Chilian mill and Wheeler pan, discarded at many mines, will\r\nsolve the problem, but the keynote of success is amalgamation without\r\noverflow. Dispense with the overflow and the gold is saved.\r\n\r\n\"Two typical mines--the Great Mercury Proprietary Gold Mine, of\r\nKuaotunu, N.Z., the other, the Pambula, N.S.W.--have lately been\r\nconducting a series of experiments with the object of saving their fine\r\ngold in an economical manner. The last and best trials made by these\r\ncompanies were at the Ballarat School of Mines, where amalgamation\r\nwithout overflow was put to a crucial test, in each case with the\r\ngratifying result that ninety-six per cent of the precious metal was\r\nsecured. What this means to the Great Mercury Mine, for instance, can\r\neasily be imagined when it is understood that notwithstanding all the\r\nlatest gold-saving adjuncts during the last six months 1260 tons of ore,\r\nworth 4l. 17s. 10 2_3d. a ton, have been put through for a saving of 1l.\r\n9s. 1 2_3d. only; or in other words over two-thirds of the gold has gone\r\nto waste (for the time being) in the tailings, and in the tailings\r\nat the present moment lie the dividends that should have cheered\r\nshareholders' hearts.\r\n\r\n\"And now for the _modus operandi_, which, it must be remembered, is not\r\nhedged in by big royalties to any one, rights, patent or otherwise. The\r\nore to be treated is first calcined, then put through a rock-breaker\r\nor stamper battery in a perfectly dry state. If the battery is used,\r\nordinary precautions, of course, must be taken to prevent waste, or the\r\ndust becoming obnoxious to the workmen. The ore is then transferred\r\nto the Chilian mill and made to the consistency of porridge, the\r\nquicksilver being added. When the principal work of amalgamation is done\r\n(experience soon teaching the amount of grinding necessary), from the\r\nChilian mill the paste (so to say) is passed to a Wheeler or any\r\nother good pan of a similar type, when the gold-saving operation is\r\ncompleted.\"\r\n\r\nThis being an experiment in the same direction as my own, I tried it on\r\na small scale. I calcined some very troublesome ore till it was fairly\r\n\"sweet,\" triturated it, and having reduced it with water to about the\r\nconsistency of invalid's gruel, put it into a little berdan pan made\r\nfrom a \"camp oven,\" which I had used for treating small quantities of\r\nconcentrates, and from time to time drove a spray of mercury, wherein a\r\nsmall amount of zinc had been dissolved, into the pasty mass by means\r\nof a steam jet, added about half an ounce of sulphuric acid and kept the\r\npan revolving for several hours. The result was an unusually successful\r\namalgamation and consequent extraction--over ninety per cent.\r\n\r\nSteam--or to use the scientific term, hydro-thermal action--has played\r\nsuch an important part in the deposition of metals that I cannot but\r\nthink that under educated intelligence it will prove a powerful agent\r\nin their extraction. About fourteen years ago I obtained some rather\r\nremarkable results from simply boiling auriferous ferro-sulphides in\r\nwater. There is in this alone an interesting, useful, and profitable\r\nfield for investigation and experiment.\r\n\r\nThe most scientific and perfect mode of gold extraction (when the\r\nconditions are favourable) is lixiviation by means of chlorine,\r\npotassium cyanide, or other aurous solvent, for by this means as much as\r\n98 per cent of the gold contained in suitable ores can be converted into\r\nits mineral salt, and being dissolved in water, re-deposited in metallic\r\nform for smelting; but lode stuff containing much lime would not be\r\nsuitable for chlorination, or the presence of a considerable proportion\r\nof such a metal as copper, particularly in metallic form, would be fatal\r\nto success, while cyanide of potassium will also attack metals other\r\nthan gold, and hence discount the effect of this solvent.\r\n\r\nThe earlier practical applications of chlorine to gold extraction were\r\nknown as Mears' and Plattner's processes, and consisted in placing the\r\nmaterial to be operated on in vats with water, and introducing chlorine\r\ngas at the bottom, the mixture being allowed to stand for a number\r\nof hours, the minimum about twelve, the maximum forty-eight. The\r\nchlorinated water was then drawn off containing the gold in solution\r\nwhich was deposited as a brown powder by the addition of sulphate of\r\niron.\r\n\r\nGreat improvements on this slow and imperfect method have been made of\r\nlate years, among the earlier of which was that of Messrs. Newbery\r\nand Vautin. They placed the pulp with water in a gaslight revolving\r\ncylinder, into which the chlorine was introduced, and atmospheric air to\r\na pressure of 60 lb. to the square inch was pumped in. The cylinder with\r\nits contents was revolved for two hours, then the charge was withdrawn\r\nand drained nearly dry by suction, the resultant liquid being slowly\r\nfiltered through broken charcoal on which the chloride crystals were\r\ndeposited, in appearance much like the bromo-chlorides of silver ore\r\nseen on some of the black manganic oxides of the Barrier silver\r\nmines. The charcoal, with its adhering chlorides, was conveyed to the\r\nsmelting-house and the gold smelted into bars of extremely pure metal.\r\nMessrs. Newbery and Vautin claimed for their process decreased time for\r\nthe operation with increased efficiency.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Morgan, when I visited that celebrated mine, they were using\r\nwhat might be termed a composite adaptation process. Their chlorination\r\nworks, the largest in the world, were putting through 1500 tons per\r\nweek. The ore as it came from the mine was fed automatically into Krom\r\nroller mills, and after being crushed and sifted to regulation gauge was\r\ndelivered into trucks and conveyed to the roasting furnaces, and thence\r\nto cooling floors, from which it was conveyed to the chlorinating\r\nshed. Here were long rows of revolving barrels, on the Newbery-Vautin\r\nprinciple, but with this marked difference, that the pressure in the\r\nbarrel was obtained from an excess of the gas itself, generated from a\r\ncharge of chloride of lime and sulphuric acid. On leaving the barrels\r\nthe pulp ran into settling vats, somewhat on the Plattner plan, and\r\nthe clear liquid having been drained off was passed through a charcoal\r\nfilter, as adopted by Newbery and Vautin. The manager, Mr. Wesley Hall,\r\nstated that he estimated cost per ton was not more than 30s., and he\r\nexpected shortly to reduce that when he began making his own sulphuric\r\nacid. As he was obtaining over 4 oz. to the ton the process was paying\r\nvery well, but it will be seen that the price would be prohibitive for\r\npoor ores unless they could be concentrated before calcination.\r\n\r\nThe Pollok process is a newer, and stated to be a cheaper mode of\r\nlixiviation by chlorine. It is the invention of Mr. J. H. Pollok, of\r\nGlasgow University, and a strong Company was formed to work it. With him\r\nthe gas is produced by the admixture of bisulphate of sodium (instead\r\nof sulphuric acid, which is a very costly chemical to transport)\r\nand chloride of lime. Water is then pumped into a strong receptacle\r\ncontaining the material for treatment and powerful hydraulic pressure is\r\napplied. The effect is stated to be the rapid change of the metal into\r\nits salt, which is dissolved in the water and afterwards treated with\r\nsulphate of iron, and so made to resume its metallic form.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, to me that there is no essential difference in the\r\npressure brought to bear for the quickening of the process. In each case\r\nit is an air cushion, induced in the one process by the pumping in of\r\nair to a cylinder partly filled with water, and in the other by pumping\r\nin water to a cylinder partly filled with air.\r\n\r\nThe process of extracting gold from lode stuff and tailings by means\r\nof cyanide of potassium is now largely used and may be thus briefly\r\ndescribed:--It is chiefly applied to tailings, that is, crushed ore\r\nthat has already passed over the amalgamating and blanket tables. The\r\ntailings are placed in vats, and subjected to the action of solutions\r\nof cyanide of potassium of varying strengths down to 0.2 per cent. These\r\ndissolve the gold, which is leached from the tailings, passed through\r\nboxes in which it is precipitated either by means of zinc shavings,\r\nelectricity, or to the precipitant. The solution is made up to its\r\nformer strength and passed again through fresh tailings. When the\r\ntailings contain a quantity of decomposed pyrites, partly oxidised, the\r\nacidity caused by the freed sulphuric acid requires to be neutralised by\r\nan alkali, caustic soda being usually employed.\r\n\r\nWhen \"cleaning up,\" the cyanide solution in the zinc precipitating boxes\r\nis replaced by clean water. After careful washing in the box, to cause\r\nall pure gold and zinc to fall to the bottom, the zinc shavings are\r\ntaken out. The precipitates are then collected, and after calcination in\r\na special furnace for the purpose of oxidising the zinc, are smelted in\r\nthe usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe following description of an electrolytic method of gold deposition\r\nfrom a cyanide solution was given by Mr. A. L. Eltonhead before the\r\nEngineers' Club of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nA description of the process is as follows:--\"The ore is crushed to a\r\ncertain fineness, depending on the character of the gangue. It is then\r\nplaced in leaching vats, with false bottoms for filtration, similar\r\nto other leaching plants. A solution of cyanide of potassium and other\r\nchemicals of known percentage is run over the pulp and left to stand\r\na certain number of hours, depending on the amount of metal to be\r\nextracted. It is then drained off and another charge of the same\r\nsolution is used, but of less strength, which is also drained. The pulp\r\nis now washed with clean water, which leaches all the gold and silver\r\nout, and leaves the tailings ready for discharge, either in cars or\r\nsluiced away by water, if it is plentiful.\r\n\r\n\"The chemical reaction of cyanide of potassium with gold is as follows,\r\naccording to Elsner:--\r\n\r\n2Au + 4KCy + O + H2O = 2KAuCy2 + 2KHO.\r\n\r\n\"That is, a double cyanide of gold and potassium is formed.\r\n\r\n\"All filtered solutions and washings from the leaching vats are saved\r\nand passed through a precipitating 'box' of novel construction, which\r\nmay consist either of glass, iron or wood, and be made in any shape,\r\neither oval, round, or rectangular--if the latter, it will be about 10\r\nft. long, 4 ft. wide and 1 ft. high--and is partitioned off lengthwise\r\ninto five compartments. Under each partition, on the inside or bottom of\r\nthe 'box,' grooves may be cut a quarter-to a half-inch deep, extending\r\nparallel with the partitions to serve as a reservoir for the amalgam,\r\nand give a rolling motion to the solution as it passes along and through\r\nthe four compartments. The centre compartment is used to hold the lead\r\nor other suitable anode and electrolyte.\r\n\r\n\"The anode is supported on a movable frame or bracket, so it may be\r\nmoved either up or down as desired, it being worked by thumb-screws at\r\neach end.\r\n\r\n\"The electrolyte may consist of saturated solutions of soluble alkaline\r\nmetals and earth. The sides or partitions of each compartment dip into\r\nthe mercury, which must cover the 'box' evenly on the bottom to the\r\ndepth of about a half-inch.\r\n\r\n\"Amalgamated copper strips or discs are placed in contact with the\r\nmercury and extended above it, to allow the gold and silver solution of\r\ncyanide to come in contact.\r\n\r\n\"The electrodes are connected with the dynamo; the anode of lead being\r\npositive and the cathode of mercury being negative. The dynamo is\r\nstarted, and a current of high amperage and low voltage is generated,\r\ngenerally 100 to 125 amperes, and with sufficient pressure to decompose\r\nthe electrolyte between the anode and the cathode.\r\n\r\n\"As the gas is generated at the anode, a commotion is created in the\r\nliquid, which brings a fresh and saturated solution of electrolyte\r\nbetween the electrodes for electrolysis, and makes it continuous in its\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\"The solution of double cyanide of gold, silver, and potassium, which\r\nhas been drained from the leaching vats, is passed over the mercury in\r\nthe precipitating 'box' when the decomposition of the electrolyte by the\r\nelectric current is being accomplished, the gold and silver are set\r\nfree and unite with the mercury, and are also deposited on the plates or\r\ndiscs of copper, forming amalgam, which is collected and made marketable\r\nby the well known and tried methods. The above solution is regenerated\r\nwith cyanide of potassium by the setting free of the metals in the\r\npassage over the 'box.'\r\n\r\n\"In using this solution again for a fresh charge of pulp, it is\r\nreinforced to the desired percentage, or strengthened with cyanide\r\nof potassium and other chemicals, and is always in good condition for\r\ncontinuing the operation of dissolving.\r\n\r\n\"The potassium acting on the water of the solution creates nascent\r\nhydrogen and potassium hydrate; the nascent hydrogen sets free the\r\nmetals (gold and silver), which are precipitated into the mercury and\r\nform amalgam, leaving hydrocyanic acid; this latter combines with\r\nthe potassium hydrate of the former reaction, thus forming cyanide of\r\npotassium. There are other reactions for which I have not at present the\r\nchemical formulas.\r\n\r\n\"As the solution passes over the mercury, the centre compartment of the\r\n'box' is moved slowly longitudinally, which spreads the mercury, the\r\nsolution is agitated and comes in perfect contact with the mercury, as\r\nwell as the amalgamated plates or discs of copper, ensuring a perfect\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\n\"It is not always necessary to precipitate all the gold and silver from\r\nthe solution, for it is used over and over again indefinitely; but when\r\nit is required, it can be done perfectly and cheaply in a very short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"No solution leached from the pulp, containing cyanide of potassium,\r\ngold and silver, need be run to waste, which is in itself an enormous\r\nsaving over the use of zinc shavings when handling large quantities of\r\npulp and solution.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the advantages the electro-chemical process has over other\r\ncyanide processes are: Its cleanliness, quickness of action, cheapness,\r\nand large saving of cyanide of potassium by regeneration; not wasting\r\nthe solutions, larger recovery of the gold and silver from the\r\nsolutions; the cost of recovery less; the loss of gold, silver, and\r\ncyanide of potassium reduced to a minimum; the use of caustic alkali in\r\nsuch quantity as may be desired to keep the cyanide solution from\r\nbeing destroyed by the solidity of the pulp, and also sometimes to give\r\nwarmth, as a warm cyanide solution will dissolve gold and silver quicker\r\nthan a cold one. These caustic alkalies do not interfere with or prevent\r\nthe perfect precipitation of the metals. The bullion recovered in this\r\nprocess is very fine, while the zinc-precipitated bullion is only about\r\n700 fine.\r\n\r\n\"The gold and silver is dissolved, and then precipitated in one\r\noperation, which we know cannot be done in the 'chlorination\r\nprocess'; besides, the cost of plant and treatment is much less in the\r\nabove-described process.\r\n\r\n\"The electro-chemical process, which I have hastily sketched will, I\r\nthink, be the future cheap method of recovering fine or flour gold from\r\nour mines and waste tailings or ore dumps.\r\n\r\n\"Without going into details of cost of treatment, I will state that with\r\na plant of a capacity of handling 10,000 tons of pulp per month,\r\nthe cost should not exceed 8s. per ton, but that may be cheapened by\r\nlabour-saving devices. There being no expensive machinery, a plant could\r\nbe very cheaply erected wherever necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCALCINATION OR ROASTING OF ORES\r\n\r\nThe object of calcining or roasting certain ores before treatment is\r\nto dissipate the sulphur or sulphides of arsenic, antimony, lead,\r\netc., which are inimical to treatment, whether by ordinary mercuric\r\namalgamation or lixiviation. The effect of the roasting is first to\r\nsublimate and drive off as fumes the sulphur and a proportion of the\r\nobjectionable metals. What is left is either iron oxide, \"gossan,\" or\r\nthe oxides of the other metals. Even lead can thus be oxidised, but\r\nrequires more care as it melts nearly as readily as antimony and is\r\nmuch less volatile. The oxides in the thoroughly roasted ore will not\r\namalgamate with mercury, and are not acted on by chlorine or cyanogen.\r\n\r\nTo effect the oxidation of sulphur, it is necessary not only to bring\r\nevery particle of sulphur into contact with the oxygen of the air, but\r\nalso to provide adequate heat to the particles sufficient to raise them\r\nto the temperature that will induce oxidation. No appreciable effect\r\nfollows the mere contact of air with sulphur particles at atmospheric\r\ntemperature; but if the particles be raised to a temperature of 500\r\ndegrees Fahr., the sulphur is oxidised to the gaseous sulphur dioxide.\r\nThe same action effects the elimination of the arsenic and antimony\r\nassociated with gold and silver ores, as when heated to a certain\r\nconstant temperature these metals readily oxidise.\r\n\r\nThe science of calcination consists of the method by which the sulphide\r\nores, having been crushed to a proper degree of fineness, are raised\r\nto a sufficient temperature and brought into intimate contact with\r\natmospheric air.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious then that the most effective method of roasting\r\nwill be one that enables the particles to be thoroughly oxidised at the\r\nlowest cost in fuel and in the most rapid manner.\r\n\r\nThe roasting processes in practical use may be divided into three\r\ncategories:\r\n\r\n_First or A Process._--Roasting on a horizontal and stationary hearth,\r\nthe flame passing over a mass of ore resting on such hearth. In order to\r\nexpose the upper surface of the ore to contact with air the material is\r\nturned over by manual labour. This furnace of the reverberatory type is\r\nprovided with side openings by which the turning over of the ore can\r\nbe manually effected, and the new ore can be charged and afterwards\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n_Second or B Process._--Roasting in a revolving hearth placed at a\r\nslight incline angle from the horizontal. The furnace is of cylindrical\r\nform and is internally lined with refractory material. It has\r\nprojections that cause the powdered ore to be lifted above the flame,\r\nand, at a certain height, to fall through the flame and so be rapidly\r\nraised to the temperature required to effect the oxidation of the\r\noxidisable minerals which it is desired to extract.\r\n\r\nThe rate, or speed, of revolution of this revolving furnace obviously\r\ndepends upon the character of the ore under treatment; it may vary from\r\ntwo revolutions per minute down to one revolution in thirty minutes. Any\r\nkind of fuel is available, but that of a gaseous character is stated to\r\nbe by far the most efficient.\r\n\r\nAny ordinary cylinder of a length of 25 ft., and a diameter of 4 ft. 6\r\nin., inclined 1 ft. 6 in. in its length, will calcine from 24 to 48 tons\r\nper diem.\r\n\r\nAnother form of rotating furnace is one in which the axis is horizontal.\r\nIt is much shorter than the inclined type, and the feeding and removal\r\nof the ore is effected by the opening of a retort lid door provided at\r\nthe side of the furnace. Openings provided at each end of the furnace\r\npermit the passage of the flame through it, and the revolution of the\r\nfurnace turns over the powdered ore and brings it into more or less\r\nsustained contact with the oxidising flame. The exposure of the ore to\r\nthis action is continued sufficiently long to ensure the more or less\r\ncomplete oxidation of the ore particles.\r\n\r\n_Third or C Process._--In this process the powdered ore is allowed to\r\nfall in a shower from a considerable height, through the centre of a\r\nvertical shaft up which a flame ascends; the powdered ore in falling\r\nthrough the flame is heated to an oxidising temperature, and the\r\nsulphides are thus depleted of their sulphur and become oxides.\r\n\r\nAnother modification of this direct fall or shaft furnace is that in\r\nwhich the fall of the ore is checked by cross-bars or inclined plates\r\nplaced across the shaft; this causes a longer oxidising exposure of the\r\nore particles.\r\n\r\nWhen the sulphur contents of pyritous ores are sufficiently high, and\r\nafter the ore has been initially fired with auxiliary carbonaceous fuel,\r\nit is unnecessary, in a properly designed roasting furnace, to add\r\nfuel to the ore to enable the heat for oxidation to be obtained. The\r\noxidation or burning of the sulphur will provide all the heat necessary\r\nto maintain the continuity of the process. The temperature necessary for\r\neffecting the elimination of both sulphur and arsenic is not higher\r\nthan that equivalent to dull red heat; and provided that there is a\r\nsufficient mass of ore maintained in the furnace, the potential heat\r\nresulting from the oxidation of the sulphur will alone be adequate to\r\nprovide all that is necessary to effect the calcination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPES OF FURNACES OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES THAT ARE IN ACTUAL USE.\r\n\r\n\"A\" OR REVERBERATORY CLASS.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this furnace has already been sufficiently\r\ndescribed. If the roasting is performed in a muffle chamber, the\r\narrangement employed by Messrs. Leach and Neal, Limited, of Derby, and\r\ndesigned by Mr. B. H. Thwaite, C.E., can be advantageously employed in\r\nthis furnace, which is fired with gaseous fuel. The sensible heat of the\r\nwaste gases is utilised to heat the air employed for combustion; and by\r\na controllable arrangement of combustion, a flame of over 100 feet in\r\nlength is obtained, with the result that the furnace from end to end is\r\nmaintained at a uniform temperature. By this system, and with gaseous\r\nfuel firing, a very considerable economy in fuel and in repairs to\r\nfurnace, and a superior roasting effect, have been obtained.\r\n\r\nWhere the ordinary reverberatory hearth is fired with solid coal from\r\nan end grate, the temperature is at its maximum near the firing end, and\r\ntails off at the extreme gas outlet end. The ores in this furnace should\r\ntherefore be fed in at the colder end of the hearth and be gradually\r\nworked or \"rabbled\" forward to the firing end.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of the reverberatory furnace is the fact that it is\r\nimpossible to avoid the incursion of air during the manual rabbling\r\naction, and this tends to cool the furnace.\r\n\r\nThe cost of roasting, to obtain the more or less complete oxidation, or\r\nwhat is known in mining parlance as a \"sweet roast\" (because a perfectly\r\nroasted ore is nearly odourless) varies considerably, the variation\r\ndepending of course upon the character of the ore and the cost of labour\r\nand fuel.\r\n\r\nThere are several modifications of the reverberatory furnace in use,\r\ndesigned mechanically to effect the rabbling. One of the most successful\r\nis that known as the Horse-shoe furnace. In plan the hearth of the\r\nfurnace resembles a horse-shoe.\r\n\r\nThe stirring of the ore over the hearth is effected by means of\r\ncarriages fixed in the centre of the furnace and having laterally\r\nprojecting arms, carrying stirrers, that move along the hearth and turn\r\nover the pulverised ore.\r\n\r\nIn operation, half the carriages are traversing the furnace, and half\r\nare resting in the cooling space, so that a control over the temperature\r\nof the stirrers is established.\r\n\r\nThis furnace is stated to be more economical in labour than other\r\nmechanically stirred reverberatory furnaces, and there is also said to\r\nbe an economy in fuel.\r\n\r\nUsually the mechanical stirring furnaces give trouble and should be\r\navoided, but the horse-shoe type possesses qualifications worthy of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\"B.\"--THE REVOLVING CYLINDER FURNACE.\r\n\r\nOf these the best known to me are: The Howell-White, the Bruckner, the\r\nThwaite-Denny, and the Molesworth.\r\n\r\nThe Bruckner is a cylinder, turning on the horizontal axis and carried\r\nby four rollers.\r\n\r\nThe batch of ore usually charged into the two charging hoppers weighs\r\nabout four tons. When the two charging doors are brought under the\r\nhopper mouth, the contents of the hopper fall directly into the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nThe ends or throats of the furnace are reduced just sufficiently to\r\nallow the flame evolved from a grated furnace to pass completely through\r\nthe cylinder.\r\n\r\nA characteristic size for this Bruckner furnace is one having a length\r\nof 12 feet and a diameter of 6 feet. A furnace of this capacity will\r\nhave an inclusive weight (iron and brickwork) of 15 tons.\r\n\r\nThe time of operation, with the Bruckner, will vary with the character\r\nof the ore under treatment and the nature of the fuel employed. Four\r\nhours is the minimum and twelve hours should be the maximum time of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nBy the addition of common salt with the batch of ore, such of its\r\nconstituents as are amenable to the action of chlorine are chlorinated\r\nas well as freed from sulphur.\r\n\r\nWhere the ore contains any considerable quantity of silver which should\r\nbe saved, the addition of the salt is necessary as the silver is very\r\nliable to become so oxidised in the process of roasting as to render\r\nits after treatment almost impossible. I know a case in point where an\r\naverage of nearly five ounces of silver to the ton, at that time worth\r\n30s., was lost owing to ignorance on this subject. Had the ore been\r\ncalcined with salt, NaCl, the bulk of this silver would have been\r\namalgamated and thus saved. It was the extraordinary fineness of the\r\ngold saved by amalgamation as against my tests of the ore by fire assay\r\nthat put me on the track of a most indefensible loss.\r\n\r\n_The Howell-White Furnace._--This furnace consists of a cast iron\r\nrevolving cylinder, averaging 25 feet in length and 4 ft. 4 in. in\r\ndiameter, which revolves on four friction rollers, resting on truck\r\nwheels, rotated by ordinary gearing.\r\n\r\nThe power required for effecting the revolution should not exceed four\r\nindicated horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder is internally lined with firebrick, projecting pieces\r\ncausing the powdered ore to be raised over the flame through which it\r\nshowers, and is thereby subjected to the influence of heat and to direct\r\ncontact oxidation.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of the cylinder, which is variable, promotes the gradual\r\ndescension of the ore from the higher to the lower end. It is fed into\r\nthe upper end, by a special form of feed hopper, and is discharged into\r\na pit at the lower end, from which the ore can be withdrawn at any time.\r\n\r\nThe gross weight of the furnace, which is, however, made in segments to\r\nbe afterwards bolted together, is some ninety to one hundred tons.\r\n\r\nThe furnace is fired with coal on a grated hearth, built at the lower\r\nend; it is more economical both in fuel and in labour than an ordinary\r\nreverberatory furnace.\r\n\r\n_The Thwaite-Denny Revolving Furnace._--This new type of furnace, which\r\nis fired with gaseous fuel, is stated to combine the advantages of the\r\nStetefeldt, the Howell-White, and the Bruckner.\r\n\r\nIt is constructed as follows:--Three short cylinders, conical in shape\r\nand of graduated dimensions, are superimposed one over the other, their\r\nends terminating in two vertical shafts of brickwork, by which the three\r\ncylinders are connected. The powdered ore is fed into the uppermost\r\ncylinder and gravitates through the series. The highest cylinder is the\r\nlargest in diameter, the lowest the smallest.\r\n\r\nThe gas flame, burnt in a Bunsen arrangement, enters the smallest end\r\nof the lowest cylinder and passes through it; then returns through the\r\nseries and the ore is reduced by the expulsion of its sulphur, arsenic,\r\netc., as it descends from the top to the bottom. The top cylinder is\r\nmade larger than the one below it and the middle cylinder is made larger\r\nthan the lowest one in proportion to the increased bulk of gases and\r\nore.\r\n\r\nThe powdered ore in descending through the cylinders is lifted up and\r\nshowers through the flame, falling in its descent a distance of over\r\n1000 feet. By the time it reaches the bottom the ore is thoroughly\r\nroasted.\r\n\r\nProvision is made for the introduction of separate supplies of air\r\nand gas into each cylinder; this enables the oxidising treatment to be\r\ncontrolled exactly as desired so as to effect the best results with all\r\nkinds of ore. Each cylinder is driven from its own independent gearing,\r\nand the speed of each cylinder can be varied at will.\r\n\r\nThe output of this type of furnace, the operations of which appear to be\r\nmore controllable than those of similar appliances, depends, of course,\r\nupon the nature of the ore, but may be considered to range within the\r\nlimits of twelve to fifty tons in twenty-four hours, and the cost of\r\nroasting will vary from 2s. 6d. to 4s. per ton, depending upon the\r\nquality of ore and of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous fuel generating system permits not only the absolute control\r\nover the temperature in the furnace, but the use of the commonest kinds\r\nof coal, and even charcoal is available.\r\n\r\nThe power required to drive the Thwaite-Denny furnace is four indicated\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\n_The Molesworth Furnace_ also is a revolving cylindrical appliance,\r\nwhich, to say the least of it, is in many respects novel and ingenious.\r\nIt consists of a slightly cone-shaped, cast-iron cylinder about fourteen\r\nfeet long, the outlet end being the larger to allow for the expansion of\r\nthe gases. Internal studs are so arranged as to keep the ore agitated;\r\nand spiral flanges convey it to the outlet end continually, shooting\r\nit across the cylinder. The cylinder is encased in a brick furnace. The\r\nfiring is provided from _outside_, the inventor maintaining that the\r\nproducts of combustion are inimical to rapid oxidisation, to specially\r\npromote which he introduces an excess of oxygen produced in a small\r\nretort set in the roof of the furnace and fed from time to time with\r\nsmall quantities of nitrate of soda and sulphuric acid. Ores containing\r\nmuch sulphur virtually calcine themselves. I have seen this appliance\r\ndoing good work. The difficulties appeared to be principally mechanical.\r\n\r\nThere are other furnaces which work with outside heat, but I have not\r\nseen them in action.\r\n\r\n\"C.\"--SHAFT TYPE OF FURNACE\r\n\r\nIn one form of this furnace, instead of allowing the ore to descend in\r\na direct clear fall the descent is impeded by inclined planes placed at\r\ndifferent levels in the height of the shaft, the ore descending from one\r\nplane to the other.\r\n\r\n_The Stetefeldt Shaft Furnace._--Although very expensive in first cost,\r\nhas many advantages. No motive power is required and the structure of\r\nthe furnace is of a durable character. Its disadvantages are:--Want\r\nof control, and the occasionally imperfect character of the roasting\r\noriginating therefrom.\r\n\r\nThree sizes of Stetefeldt's furnaces are constructed:\r\n\r\nThe largest will roast from 40 to 80 tons per diem.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate will roast from 20 to 40 tons per diem.\r\n\r\nThe smallest will roast from 10 to 20 tons per diem.\r\n\r\nA good furnace should bring down the sulphur contents even of\r\nconcentrates so as to be innocuous to mercuric amalgamation. The sulphur\r\nleft in the ore should never be allowed to exceed two per cent.\r\n\r\nA forty per cent pyritous or other sulphide ore should be roasted in a\r\nrevolving furnace in thirty to forty minutes, and without any auxiliary\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary purposes a 40-foot chimney is adequate for furnace work;\r\nsuch a chimney four feet square inside at the base, tapering to 2' 6\" at\r\nthe summit, will require 12,000 red bricks, and 1500 fire-bricks for\r\nan internal lining to a height of 12 feet from the base of the chimney\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nWhen second-hand Lancashire or Cornish boiler flues are available, they\r\nmake admirable and inexpensive chimneys. The advantage of wrought-iron\r\nor steel chimneys lies in the convenience of removal and erection. They\r\nshould be made in sections of 20 feet long, three steel wire guy-ropes\r\nattached to a ring, riveted to a ring two-thirds of the height of the\r\nchimney, and attached to holdfasts driven into the ground; tightening\r\ncouplings should be provided for each wire.\r\n\r\nFlue dust depositing chambers should be built in the line of the flues\r\nbetween the furnace and the chimney; they consist simply of carefully\r\nbuilt brick chambers, with openings to enable workmen to enter and\r\nrapidly clear away the deposited matters. The chambers, three or four\r\ntimes the cross sectional area of the chimney flue, and ten to twenty\r\nfeet long, can be built of brickwork, set in cement; the walls are\r\nprovided with a cavity, filled with sand or Portland cement, so that\r\nthere will be no danger of the incursion of air. In all furnace work\r\nthe greatest possible precautions should be taken to prevent the least\r\ncracking of either joints or bricks. It is surprising how much the\r\ninadequate draft of a good chimney is due to cracks or orifices in the\r\nflues; and therefore a competent furnace-man should see to it that his\r\nflues are thoroughly sound, and free from openings through which the air\r\ncan enter.[*]\r\n\r\n     [*] For full details of the most recent improvements in the\r\n     cyanide process and in other methods of extraction, the\r\n     reader is referred to Dr. T. K. Rose's \"Metallurgy of Gold,\"\r\n     third edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMOTOR POWER AND ITS TRANSMISSION\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to describe methods by which power for mining purposes\r\nhas been obtained--that is, up to within the last five years--beyond\r\na general statement, that when water power has been available in the\r\nimmediate locality of the mine, this cheap natural source of power has\r\nbeen called upon to do duty. Steam has been the alternative agent of\r\npower production applied in many different ways, but labouring under as\r\nmany disadvantages, chief of which are lack of water, scarcity of fuel\r\nand cost of transit of machinery. Sometimes condensing steam-engines\r\nhave been employed. For the generation of steam the semi-portable and\r\nsemi-tubular have been the type of boiler that has most usually been\r\nbrought into service. Needless to say, when highly mineralised mine\r\nwater only is available the adoption of this class of boiler is attended\r\nwith anything but satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, there is strong evidence that where steam is the\r\npower agent to be employed the water-tube type of boiler is likely to be\r\nemployed, and to the exclusion of all other forms of apparatus for\r\nthe generation of steam. The advantages of this type, particularly the\r\ntubulous form (or a small water tube), made as it is in sections, offers\r\nunrivalled facilities for transport service. The heaviest parts need\r\nnot exceed 3 cwt. in weight, and require neither heavy nor yet expensive\r\nbrickwork foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERLESS POWER.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in finding water to drive a steam plant are often of\r\nsuch a serious character as to involve the abandonment of many payable\r\nmines; therefore, a motive power that does not require the aqueous agent\r\nwill be a welcome boon.\r\n\r\nIt will be a source of gratification to many a gold-claim holder to know\r\nthat practical science has enabled motive power to be produced without\r\nthe necessity of water, except a certain very small quantity, which once\r\nsupplied will not require to be renewed, unless to compensate for the\r\nloss due to atmospheric evaporation.\r\n\r\nAny carbonaceous fuel, such as, say, lignite, coal, or charcoal, can be\r\nemployed. The latter can be easily produced by the method described\r\nin the Chapter on \"Rules of Thumb,\" or by building a kiln by piling\r\ntogether a number of trunks of trees, or fairly large-sized branches,\r\ncut so that they can be built up in a compact form. The pile, after\r\nbeing covered with earth, is then lighted from the base, and if there\r\nare no inlets for the air except the limited proportion required for the\r\nsmouldering fire at the base, the whole of the timber will be gradually\r\ncarbonised to charcoal of good quality, which is available for the\r\nwaterless power plant.\r\n\r\nThe waterless power plant consists of two divisions: First, a gas\r\ngenerating plant; secondly, an internal combustion or gas engine in\r\nwhich the gas is burnt, producing by thermo-dynamic action the motive\r\npower required. The system known as the Thwaite Power Gas System is not\r\nonly practically independent of the use of water, but its efficiency in\r\nconverting fuel heat into work is so high that no existing steam plant\r\nwill be able to compete with it.\r\n\r\nThe weight of raw timber, afterwards to be converted into charcoal, that\r\nwill be required to produce an effective horse-power for one hour equals\r\n7 lb.\r\n\r\nIf coal is the fuel 1 1/3 lb. per E.H.P. for one hour's run.\r\n\r\nIf lignite is the fuel 2 1/2 lb. per E.H.P. for one hour's run.\r\n\r\nThe plant is simple to work, and as no steam boiler is required the\r\ndanger of explosions is removed. No expensive chimney is necessary for\r\nthe waterless power plant.\r\n\r\nWhere petroleum oil can be cheaply obtained, say for twopence per\r\ngallon, one of the Otto Cycle Oil Engines, for powers up to 20 indicated\r\nhorse-power, can be advantageously employed.\r\n\r\nThese engines have the advantage of being a self-contained power,\r\nrequiring neither chimney nor steam boiler, and may be said to be a\r\nwaterless power. The objection is the necessity to rely upon oil as\r\nfuel, and the dangers attending the storage of oil. A good oil engine\r\nshould not require to use more than a pint of refined petroleum per\r\nindicated horse-power working for one hour.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the mining industry electricity, that magic and\r\nmysterious agency, has come to its assistance, in permitting motive\r\npower to be transmitted over distances of even as much as 100 miles with\r\ncomparatively little loss of the original power energy.\r\n\r\nGiven, that on a coal or lignite field, or at a waterfall, 100\r\nhorse-power is developed by the combustion of fuel or by the fall of\r\nwater driving a turbine, this power can be electrically transmitted to a\r\nmine or GROUP OF MINES, say 100 miles away, with only a loss of some 30\r\nhorse-power. For twenty miles the loss on transmission should not exceed\r\n15 horse-power so that 70 and 85 horse-power respectively are available\r\nat the mines. No other system offers such remarkable efficiencies of\r\npower transmission. The new Multiphase Alternating Electric Generating\r\nand Power Transmission System is indeed so perfect as to leave\r\npractically no margin for improvement.\r\n\r\nThe multiphase electric motor can be directly applied to the stamp\r\nbattery and ore-breaker driving-shaft and to the shaft of the\r\namalgamating pans.\r\n\r\n     APPROXIMATE POWER REQUIRED TO DRIVE THE MACHINERY OF A MINE.\r\n\r\n     Rock breaker                           10    effective horse-power\r\n     Amalgamating pan                        5    effective horse-power\r\n     Grinding pan                            6    effective horse-power\r\n     Single stamp of 750 lb. dropping\r\n     90 times per minute                   1.25 effective horse-power\r\n     Settlers                                4    effective horse-power\r\n     Ordinary hoisting lift                  20   effective horse-power\r\n\r\n     Allow 10 per cent in addition for overcoming friction.\r\n\r\nBesides this electrical distribution power, which should not cost more\r\nthan three farthings per effective horse-power per hour, the electrical\r\nenergy can be employed for lighting the drives and the shafts of the\r\nmine. The modern electrical mine lamps leave little to be desired. Also\r\nit is anticipated that once the few existing difficulties have been\r\nsurmounted electric drilling will supplant all other methods.\r\n\r\nElectric power can be employed for pumping, for shot firing, for\r\nhauling, and for innumerable purposes in a mine.\r\n\r\nElectricity lends itself most advantageously to so many and varied\r\nprocesses, even in accelerating the influence of cyanide solutions on\r\ngold, and in effecting the magnetic influence on metallic particles\r\nin separating processes; while applied to haulage purposes, either on\r\naerial lines or on tram or railroads, it is an immediate and striking\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that in the near future the mines on the Randt, South\r\nAfrica, will be electrically driven from a coalfield generating station\r\nlocated on the coalfields some thirty miles from Johannesburg. Such\r\na plant made up of small multiples of highly efficient machines will\r\nenable mine-owners to obtain a reliable power to any extent at immediate\r\ncommand and at a reasonable charge in proportion to the power used. This\r\nwholesale supply of power will be a godsend to a new field, enabling the\r\nopening up to be greatly expedited; and no climatic difficulties, such\r\nas dry seasons, or floods, need interfere with the regular running of\r\nthe machinery. The same system of power-generation at a central station\r\nis to be applied to supply power to the mines of Western Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCOMPANY FORMATION AND OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nAll the world over, the operation of winning from the soil and rendering\r\nmarketable the many valuable ores and mine products which abound is\r\ndaily becoming more and more a scientific business which cannot be too\r\ncarefully entered into or too skilfully conducted. The days of the\r\ndolly and windlass, of the puddler, cradle, and tin dish, are rapidly\r\nreceding; and mining, either in lode or alluvial working, is being more\r\ngenerally recognised as one of the exact sciences. In the past, mining\r\nhas been carried on in a very haphazard fashion, to which much of its\r\nnon-success may be attributed.\r\n\r\nBut the dawn of better days has arrived, and with the advent of schools\r\nof mines and technical colleges there will in future be less excuse for\r\nignorance in this most important industry.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will be devoted to Company formation and working, in which\r\nmistakes leading to very serious consequences daily occur.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to go deeply into the question why, in the mining\r\nindustry more than any other, it should be deemed desirable as a general\r\nrule to carry on operations by means of public Companies, but, as a\r\nmatter of fact, few names can be mentioned of men who mine extensively\r\nsingle handed. Yet, risky as it is, mining can hardly be said to be more\r\nsubject to unpreventable vicissitudes than, say, pastoral pursuits, in\r\nwhich private individuals risk, and often lose or make, enormous sums of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is with Mining Companies we are now dealing, and with the\r\nerrors made in the formation and after conduct of these Associations.\r\n\r\nThe initial mistake most often made is that sufficient working capital\r\nis not called up or provided in the floating of the Company. Promoters\r\ntrust to get sufficient from the ground forthwith to ensure further\r\ndevelopment; the consequence being that, as nearly 99 per cent of mining\r\nproperties require a very considerable expenditure of capital before\r\npermanent profits can be relied on, the inexperienced shareholders who\r\nstarted with inflated hopes of enormous returns and immediate dividends\r\nbecome disheartened and forfeit their shares by refusing to pay calls,\r\nand thus many good properties are sacrificed. In England, the companies\r\nare often floated fully paid-up, but the same initial error of providing\r\ntoo little money for the equipment and effective working of the mine is\r\nusually fallen into.\r\n\r\nAgain, far too many Companies are floated on the report of some\r\nself-styled mining expert, often a man, who, like the schoolmaster of\r\nthe last century, has qualified for the position by failing in every\r\nother business he has attempted. These men acquire a few geological and\r\nmining phrases, and by more or less skilfully interlarding these with\r\nstatements of large lodes and big returns they supply reports seductive\r\nenough to float the most worthless properties and cause the waste of\r\nthousands of pounds. But the trouble does not end here.\r\n\r\nWhen the Company is to be formed, some lawyer, competent or otherwise,\r\nis instructed to prepare articles of association, rules, etc.; which,\r\nthree times out of four, is accomplished by a liberal employment\r\nof scissors and paste. Such rules may, or may not, be suited to the\r\nrequirements of the organisation. Generally no one troubles much about\r\nthe matter, though on these rules depends the future efficient working\r\nof the Company, and sometimes its very existence.\r\n\r\nThen Directors have to be appointed, and these are seldom selected\r\nbecause of any special knowledge of mining they may possess, but as a\r\nrule simply because they are large shareholders or prominent men whose\r\nnames look well in a prospectus. These gentlemen forthwith engage a\r\nSecretary, usually on the grounds that he is the person who has tendered\r\nlowest, to provide office accommodation and keep the accounts; and not\r\nfrom any particular knowledge he has of the true requirements of the\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe way in which some Directors contrive to spend their shareholders'\r\nmoney is humorously commented on by a Westralian paper which describes\r\na great machinery consignment lately landed in the neighbourhood of the\r\nBoulder Kalgoorlie.\r\n\r\n\"It would seem as if the purchaser had been let loose blindfold in a\r\nprehistoric material-founder's old iron yard, and having bought up the\r\nwhole stock, had shipped it off. The feature of the entire antediluvian\r\nshow is the liberal allowance of material devoted to destruction.\r\nMassive kibbles, such as were used in coal mines half a century ago, are\r\narranged alongside a winding engine, built in the middle of the century,\r\nand evidently designed for hauling the kibbles from a depth of 1000\r\nfeet. Nothing less than horse-power will stir the trucks for underground\r\nuse, and their design is distinctly of the antique type. The engine\r\nis built to correspond--of a kind that might have served to raise into\r\nposition the pillars of Baalbec, and the mass of metal in it fairly\r\nraises a blush to the iron cheek of frailer modern constructions. The\r\none grand use to which this monster could be put would be to employ it\r\nas a kedge for the Australian continent in the event of it dragging its\r\npresent anchors and drifting down south, but as modern mining machinery\r\nthe whole consignment is worth no more than its value as scrap-iron,\r\nwhich in its present position is a fraction or two less than nothing.\"\r\n\r\nNext, a man to manage the mine has to be obtained, and some one is\r\nplaced in charge, of whose capabilities the Directors have no direct\r\nknowledge. Being profoundly ignorant of practical mining they are\r\nincompetent to examine him as to his qualifications, or to check his\r\nmode of working, so as to ascertain whether he is acting rightly or\r\nnot. All they have to rely on are some certificates often too carelessly\r\ngiven and too easily obtained. Finally, quite a large proportion of the\r\nallottees of shares have merely applied for them with the intention of\r\nselling out on the first opportunity at a premium, hence they have no\r\nspecial interest in the actual working of the mine.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at the prospects of the Association thus formed. The\r\nlegal Manager or Secretary, often a young and inexperienced man, knows\r\nlittle more than how to keep an ordinary set of books, and not always\r\nthat. He is quite ignorant of the actual requirements of the mine, or\r\nwhat is a fair price to pay for labour, appliances, or material. He\r\ncannot check the expenditure of the Mining Manager, who may be a rogue\r\nor a fool or both, for we have had samples of all sorts to our sorrow.\r\nThe Directors are in like case. Even where the information is honestly\r\nsupplied, they cannot judge whether the work is being properly carried\r\nout or is costing a fair price, and the Mining Manager is left to his\r\nown devices, with no one to check him nor any with whom he can consult\r\nin specially difficult cases. Thus matters drift to the almost certain\r\nconclusion of voluntary or compulsory winding up; and so many a\r\ngood property is ruined, and promising mines, which have never had a\r\nreasonable trial, are condemned as worthless. But let us ask, would any\r\nother business, even such as are less subject to unforeseen vicissitudes\r\nthan mining, succeed under similar circumstances?\r\n\r\nIt is now very generally agreed that to the profitable development of\r\nmining new countries, at all events, must look mainly for prosperity,\r\nwhile other industries are growing. Therefore, we cannot too seriously\r\nconsider how we may soonest make our mines successful.\r\n\r\nWhat is the remedy for the unsatisfactory state of affairs we have\r\nexperienced? The answer is a more practical system of working from the\r\ninception. Although it may evoke some difference of opinion I consider\r\nit both justifiable and desirable that the State should take some\r\noversight of mining matters, at all events in the case of public\r\nCompanies. It would be a salutary rule that the promoters of any mining\r\nundertaking should, before they are allowed to place it on the market,\r\nobtain and pay for the services of a competent Government Mining\r\nInspector, who need not necessarily be a Government officer, but might,\r\nlike licensed surveyors, be granted a certificate of competency either\r\nby a School of Mines or by some qualified Board of Examiners. The\r\ncertificate of such Inspector that the property was as represented,\r\nshould be given before the prospectus was issued. It is arguable whether\r\neven further oversight might not be properly be taken by the State and\r\nthe report of a qualified officer be compulsory that the property was\r\nreasonably worth the value placed upon it in the prospectus.\r\n\r\nProbably it will be contended that such restrictions would be an undue\r\ninterference with private rights, and the old aphorism about a fool and\r\nhis folly will be quoted. There are doubtless fools so infatuated\r\nthat if they were brayed in a ten hundred-weight stamp-battery the\r\n\"foolishness that had not departed from them\" would give a highly\r\npayable percentage to the ton. Yet the State in other matters tries by\r\nnumerous laws to protect such from their folly. A man may not sell a\r\nload of wood without the certificate from a licensed weighbridge or a\r\nloaf of bread without, if required, having to prove its weight; and we\r\nsend those to gaol who practise on the credulity and cupidity of fools\r\nby means of the \"confidence trick.\" Why not, therefore, where interests\r\nwhich may be said to be national are involved, endeavour to ensure fair\r\ndealing?\r\n\r\nThen with regard to the men who are to manage the mines, seeing that\r\na man may not become captain or mate of a river steamboat without some\r\ncertificate on competency, nor drive her engines before he has passed an\r\nexamination to prove his fitness, surely it is not too much to say that\r\nthe mine manager or engineer, to whose care are often confided the lives\r\nof hundreds of men, and the expenditure of thousands of pounds, should\r\nbe required to obtain a recognised diploma to prove his qualifications.\r\nThe examinations might be made comparatively easy at first, but\r\nafterwards, when by the establishment of Schools and Mines the\r\nfacilities have been afforded for men to thoroughly qualify, the\r\nstandard should be raised; and after a date to be fixed no man should be\r\npermitted to assume the charge of a mine or become one of its officers\r\nwithout a proper certificate of competency from some recognised School\r\nof Mines or Technical College. The effect of such a regulation would in\r\na few years produce most beneficial results.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, whose \"progressive\" legislature I do not generally\r\ncommend, they have, in the matter of mine management, at all events,\r\ntaken a step in the right direction. There a mine manager, before\r\nhe obtains his certificate, must have served at least two years\r\nunderground, and has to pass through a severe examination, lasting for\r\ndays, in all subjects relating to mining and machinery connected with\r\nmining. In addition, he must prove his capacity by making an underground\r\nsurvey, and then plotting his work. The examination is a stiff one,\r\nas may be judged from the fact that between 1886 and 1891, only 27\r\ncandidates passed. Then the conditions were made easier, and from that\r\ndate to 1895, 19 passed. Of the 46 students who gained first-class\r\nhonours, 30 have left for South Africa or Australia, in both of which\r\ncountries New Zealand certificated men are held in high estimation.\r\n\r\nBut returning to the formation of the Company, care should be taken in\r\nappointing Directors that at least one member of the Board is selected\r\non account of his special technical knowledge of mining, and others for\r\ntheir special business capacity. The ornamental men with high sounding\r\nnames should not be required in legitimate ventures. Also, it is most\r\nimportant that the business Manager or Secretary should be a specially\r\nqualified man, who by experience has learned what are the requirements\r\nof a mine doing a certain amount of work, so that a proper check may\r\nbe kept on the expenses. The more Companies such a Secretary has the\r\nbetter, as one qualified man can supervise a large staff of clerks, who\r\nwould themselves be qualifying for similar work, and gaining a useful\r\nand varied experience of mining business. An office of this description\r\nhaving charge of a large number of mines is, in its way, a technical\r\nschool, and lads trained therein would be in demand as mine pursers, a\r\nvery responsible and necessary officer in a big mine.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the men to whom the actual mining and treatment of ores\r\nand machinery is committed the greatest mistakes of the past have been\r\nthat too much has been required from one man, a combination not to be\r\nfound probably in one man in a thousand. Such Admirable Crichtons are\r\nrare in any profession or business, and that of mining is no exception.\r\nMen who profess too much are to be distrusted. Your best men are they\r\nwho concentrate their energies and intellects in special directions.\r\nThe Mining Manager should, if possible, be chosen from men holding\r\ncertificates of competency from some technical mining school and,\r\nof course, should, in addition, have some practical experience, not\r\nnecessarily as Head Manager. He should understand practical mine\r\nsurveying and calculation of quantities, be able to dial and plot out\r\nhis workings, and prepare an intelligible plan thereof for the use of\r\nthe Directors, and should understand sufficient of physics, particularly\r\npneumatics and hydraulics, to ensure thoroughly efficient pumping\r\noperations without loss of power from unnecessarily heavy appliances.\r\nAny other scientific knowledge applicable to his business which he may\r\nhave acquired will tell in his favour, but he must, above all things,\r\nbe a thoroughly practical man. Such men will in time be more readily\r\nprocurable, as boys who have passed through the various Schools of Mines\r\nwill be sent to learn their business practically at the mines just as we\r\nnow, having given a lad a course of naval instruction, send him to sea\r\nto learn the practical part of his life's work.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, more is wanted on a mine than a man who can direct the\r\nsinking of shafts, driving of levels, and stoping of the lode. Much\r\nloss and disappointment have resulted in the past from unsuitable,\r\nineffective, or badly designed and erected machinery, whether for\r\nworking the mine or treating the ores. To obviate this defect a\r\nfirst-class mining engineer is required.\r\n\r\nThen, also, day by day we are more surely learning that mining in all\r\nits branches is a science, and that the treatment of ores and extraction\r\nof the metals is daily becoming more and more the work of the laboratory\r\nrather than of the rule-of-thumb procedure of the past. Every mine,\r\nwhether it be of gold, silver, tin, copper, or other metal, requires the\r\nsupervision of a thoroughly qualified metallurgist and chemist, and one\r\nwho is conversant with the newest processes for the extraction of the\r\nmetals from their ores and matrices.\r\n\r\nIt has then been stated that to ensure effective working each mine\r\nrequires, in addition to competent directors, a business manager,\r\nmining-manager, and assistants, engineer, chemist, and metallurgist,\r\nwith assistant assayers, etc., all highly qualified men. But it will be\r\nasked, how are many struggling mines in sparsely populated countries\r\nto obtain the services of all these eminent scientists? The reply is by\r\nco-operation. One of the most ruinous mistakes of the past has been that\r\neach little mining venture has started on an independent course, with\r\ndifferent management, separate machinery, etc. Can it then be wondered\r\nat that our gold-mining is not always successful?\r\n\r\nUnder a co-operative system all that each individual mine would require\r\nwould be a qualified, practical miner capable of opening and securing\r\nthe ground in a miner-like manner, and a good working engineer; and\r\nin gold-mining, where the gold is free in its matrix, a professional\r\namalgamator, or lixiviator. For the rest, half a dozen or more mines may\r\ncollectively retain the services of a mine manager of high attainments\r\nas general inspector and superintendent, and the same system could be\r\nadopted with respect to an advising metallurgist and an engineer. For\r\ngold, as indeed for other metals, a central extracting works, where the\r\nores could be scientifically treated in quantity, might be erected at\r\njoint cost, or might easily be arranged for as a separate business.\r\n\r\nA very fruitful cause of failure is the fatuous tendency of directors\r\nand mine managers to adopt new processes and inventions simply because\r\nthey are new. As an inventor in a small way myself, and one who is\r\nalways on the watch for improved methods, I do not wish to discourage\r\nintelligent progress; but the greatest care should be exercised by those\r\nhaving the control of the money of shareholders in mining properties\r\nbefore adopting any new machinery or process.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, and unfortunately shall see, many a promising mining\r\ncompany brought to grief by this popular error. The directors of mining\r\ncompanies might, to use an American saying, \"paste this in their hats\"\r\nas a useful and safe aphorism. \"LET OTHERS DO THE EXPERIMENTING; WE ARE\r\nWILLING TO PAY ONLY FOR PROVED IMPROVEMENTS.\" I can cordially endorse\r\nevery word of the following extracts from Messrs. McDermott and\r\nDuffield's admirable little work, \"Losses in Gold Amalgamation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some directors of mining companies are naturally inclined to listen to\r\nthe specious promises of inventors of novel processes and new machinery,\r\nforgetting their own personal disadvantage in any argument on\r\nsuch matters, and assuming a confidence in the logic of their own\r\nconclusions, while they ignore the fruitful experience of thousands\r\nof practical men who are engaged in the mining business. The repeated\r\nfailures of directors in sending out new machinery to their mines ought\r\nby this time to be a sufficient warning against increasing risks that\r\nare at once natural and unavoidable, and to deter them from plunging\r\ntheir shareholders into experiments which, in ninety-nine cases out of a\r\nhundred, result in nothing but excessive and needless expenses.\r\n\r\n\"It is certain that new machines and new processes are, and will be,\r\ngiven attention by mining men in proportion to their probable merits;\r\nbut the proper place for experiments is in a mill already as successful\r\nas under known processes it can be made. In a new enterprise, even when\r\nthe expense of an experiment is undertaken by the inventor, the loss to\r\nthe mine-owner in case of failure must be very great, both in time\r\nand general running expenses. Directors should not believe that a\r\nwillingness to risk cash in proving an invention is necessarily any\r\nproof of value of the same; it is only a measure of the faith of the\r\ninventor, which is hardly a safe standard to risk shareholders' money\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\"The variety of modifications in approved processes ought at least to\r\nsuggest the desirability of exhausting the known, before drawing on the\r\nunknown and purely speculative. It should also be borne in mind that\r\nwhat might appear at first sight to be new processes, and even new\r\nmachinery, are, in fact, often nothing but old contrivances and\r\nplausible theories long ago exploded among practical men.\r\n\r\n\"Many mining companies have been ruined, without any reference to their\r\nmines, through men deciding on the reasonableness of new process and\r\nmachinery who have no knowledge of the business in hand. It is assumed\r\noften, that if an inventor or manufacturer of new machinery will agree\r\nto guarantee success, or take no pay if not successful, the company\r\ntakes no risk. In actual fact a whole year is wasted in most cases,\r\nfailure spoils the reputation of the company, running expenses have\r\ncontinued, and further working capital cannot be raised, because\r\nall concerned have lost confidence by the failure to obtain returns\r\npromised. All this in addition to the regular, unavoidable risks of\r\nmining itself, which may, at any moment during the year lost, call\r\nfor increased expenses and increased faith in ultimate success. To the\r\nmining man who makes money by the business, the natural risks of mining\r\nis all he will take; it is sufficient; and when he invests more money in\r\nmachinery he takes good care that he takes no chances of either failure\r\nor delay.\r\n\r\n\"The following are rules which no mining company or individual\r\nmine-owner can afford to neglect.\r\n\r\n\"(1) The risk should be confined to mining. No body of directors is\r\njustified in taking a shareholder's money and investing it in new\r\nprocesses or machinery when the subscription was simply for a mining\r\nventure. Directors are invariably incapable of deciding whether a\r\nso-called improvement in machinery or process is really so or not, and\r\nthe reasonable course is to follow established precedents.\r\n\r\n\"(2) The risk of selecting an incompetent manager should be reduced to\r\nminimum by taking a man with a successful record in the particular work\r\nto be done. The manager selected should be prohibited, as much as the\r\ndirectors, from experimenting with new methods or machinery. A really\r\nexperienced man will require no check in this direction, as he will not\r\nrisk ruining his reputation.\r\n\r\n\"(3) The only time for a company to experiment is when the mine is\r\npaying well by the usual methods, and the treasury is in a condition to\r\nspeculate a little in possible improvements without jeopardising regular\r\nreturns.\"\r\n\r\nProbably this is the best place to insert another word of warning to\r\ndirectors who are not mining specialists, and also to investors in gold\r\nmining shares. Assays of auriferous lode material are almost invariably\r\nworthless as a guide in the real value of the stone in quantity. The one\r\nway to decide this is by battery treatment in bulk, and then only after\r\nmany tons have been put through. The reason is obvious. First, the\r\nprospector or company promoter, if he knows it, is not in the least\r\nlikely to pick the worst piece of stone in the heap for assay; and,\r\nsecondly, even should the sample be selected with the sole object of\r\ngetting a fair result, no living man can judge the value of a gold lode\r\nby the result of treatment of an ounce of stone. So when you see it\r\nstated that Messrs. Oro and Gildenstein, the celebrated assayers, have\r\nfound that a sample of rock from the Golden Mint Mine, Golconda, assays\r\nat the rate of 2,546 oz. 13 dwt. and 21 gr. to the ton, and that there\r\nare thousands of tons of similar stone in sight, the statement should\r\nbe received with due caution. The assay is doubtless correct, but the\r\ndeductions therefrom are most misleading.\r\n\r\nA few words of advice also to directors of mine-purchasing companies and\r\nsyndicates, of which there are now so many in existence, may probably be\r\nfound of value. It is not good policy as a general rule to buy entirely\r\nundeveloped properties, unless such have been inspected by your own man,\r\nwho is both competent and trustworthy, and who should have indeed an\r\ninterest in the profits. Large areas, although so popular in England,\r\ndo not compensate for large bodies of payable ore; the most remunerative\r\nmine is generally one of comparatively small area, but containing a\r\nlarge lode formation of payable but often low grade, ore.\r\n\r\nIt is worse still, of course, to buy a practically worked out mine,\r\nthough this too is sometimes done. It must be remembered that mining,\r\nthough often so profitable, is nevertheless a destructive industry, thus\r\ndiffering from agriculture, which is productive, and manufactures, which\r\nare constructive. Every ton of stone broken and treated from even the\r\nbest gold mine in the world makes that mine the poorer by one ton of\r\nvaluable material; thus, to buy a mining property on its past reputation\r\nfor productiveness is, as a rule, questionable policy, unless you know\r\nthere is sufficient good ore in sight to cover the purchase cost and\r\nleave a profit.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest causes of non-success of gold-mining ventures,\r\nparticularly when worked by public companies, is the lack of actual\r\npersonal supervision, and hence, among other troubles, is that\r\nultra-objectionable one--gold stealing from the mills, or, in alluvial\r\nmining, from the tail races. As to the former, the following appeared\r\nin 1893 in the London _Mining Journal_, and is, I think, worthy of the\r\nclose consideration of mine directors in all parts of the world:--\r\n\r\n\"No one that has not experienced the evil of gold thieving from\r\nreduction mills can have any idea of the pernicious element it is, and\r\nthe difficulty, once that it has got 'well hold,' of rooting it out.\r\nIt permeates every class of society in the district connected with the\r\nindustry, and managers, amalgamators, assayers, accountants, aye, even\r\nbank officials, are 'all on the job' to 'get a bit' while there is an\r\nopportunity. To exterminate the hateful monster requires on the part\r\nof the mine proprietors combined, stern and drastic measures undertaken\r\nunder the personal supervision of one or more of their directors, and\r\nin many instances necessitating the removal of the whole of the official\r\nstaff.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer narrates how about twenty years ago he was led to suspect\r\nthat in an Australian mine running forty head of stamps, in which he\r\nheld a controlling interest, the owners were being defrauded of about a\r\nfourth of the gold really contained in the ore, and the successful steps\r\ntaken to check the robbery.\r\n\r\n\"We first of all dispensed with the services of the general manager, and\r\nthen issued the following instructions to the mine and mill managers,\r\nI remaining at the mine to see them carried out until I substituted a\r\npractical local man as agent, who afterwards carried on the work most\r\nefficiently:--\r\n\r\n\"(a) Both of these officials to keep separate books and accounts; in\r\nother words, to be distinct departments.\r\n\r\n\"(b) The ore formerly was all thrown together and put through the mill.\r\nI subdivided it into four classes, A, B, C, and D, representing deep\r\nlevels north and upper levels north, deep levels south and upper levels\r\nsouth, and allotted to each class ten heads of stamps at the mill.\r\n\r\n\"(c) The mine manager to try three prospects, forenoon and afternoon\r\nof each day, from the dumps of each of the four classes and record in a\r\nbook to be kept for that purpose the estimated mill yield of each one.\r\n\r\n\"(d) The mill manager was required to do the same at the mill and keep\r\nhis record.\r\n\r\n\"(e) There were four underground bosses in each shift, twelve in all.\r\nI had a book fixed at the top of the shaft in which I required each of\r\nthese men, at the expiry of every shift, to record any change in the\r\nfaces of the quartz and particularly in regard to quality.\r\n\r\n\"(f) Having divided the ore into four classes I instructed the\r\namalgamators, of which there were two in each shift, six in all, that I\r\nrequired the amalgam from each to be kept separate, with the object of\r\nascertaining what each part of the mine produced.\r\n\r\n\"(g) I procured padlocks for the covering boards of the mercury tables\r\nand gave the keys to the amalgamators with instructions that they were\r\nnot to hand them over to any one except the exchange shift without my\r\nwritten authority, and instructed them that they should clean down the\r\nplates every three hours, and after cleaning down the amalgam, buckets\r\nto be placed in the cleaning room, which I instructed to be kept locked\r\nand the key in charge of the watchman night and day.\r\n\r\n\"(h) The whole of the amalgam taken from the plates during each\r\ntwenty-four hours to be cleaned and squeezed by the two amalgamators on\r\nduty every forenoon at nine o'clock in the presence of the mill manager,\r\nwho should weigh each lot and enter it in a book to be kept for the\r\npurpose, and the entry to be signed by the mill manager and both\r\namalgamators as witnesses.\r\n\r\n\"(i) Every alternate Friday the mortars (boxes) to be cleaned out; the\r\nwork to be commenced punctually at eight A.M. by the six amalgamators in\r\nthe presence of the mill manager, assisted by the three amalgam cleaning\r\nroom watchmen and the four battery feeders on duty, prohibiting any of\r\nthem from leaving until the cleaning up was finished, and the amalgam\r\ncleaned, squeezed and weighed, and the amount entered by the mill\r\nmanager in the record look and attested by the amalgamators.\r\n\r\n\"I think the intelligent readers (particularly those with a knowledge\r\nof the business) will see the drift of the above regulations, viz., for\r\nthere to be any peculation the whole of the battery staff--fourteen in\r\nall--would have to participate in it, and the number was too many to\r\nkeep a secret. Formerly the amalgam cleaning room was sacred to the mill\r\nmanager, and on announcing to that official the new instructions he at\r\nonce tendered his resignation in a tone of offended dignity, immediately\r\nfollowed by that of the mine manager. It is a significant fact that\r\nshortly afterwards these two officials purchased a large mill and other\r\nproperty at a cost of ten thousand pounds, and that the mine yielded\r\nfor the following three years during which I was connected with it an\r\naverage of over 17 dwt. to the ton, as against formerly 10 to 12 dwt.\r\n\r\n\"The reader must draw his own conclusions. I used to make it a practice\r\nto visit the mine daily and prospect the ore, and having the mine and\r\nmill managers' daily prospecting as a guide as well as my own, every\r\nman at the mill knew it was impossible for them to thieve without my\r\ndetecting it; moreover, I made it a rule to discharge any of the mill\r\nemployees that I discovered were interested in any small private claims.\r\n\r\n\"The crux of the whole thing is having a practical miner at the head of\r\naffairs, and it is impossible for him to thieve if the work is carried\r\nout in the manner I have described.\"\r\n\r\nTo bring the whole matter to a conclusion. It may be taken as a safe\r\naxiom that to make gold mining in the mine as distinct from mining on\r\nthe Stock Exchange really profitable the same system of economy, of\r\npractical supervision, and scientific knowledge which is now adopted in\r\nall other businesses must be applied to the raising and extraction of\r\nthe metal. Then, and not till then, will genuine mining take the place\r\nto which it is entitled amongst our industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRULES OF THUMB\r\n\r\nThis chapter has been headed as above because a number of the rules\r\nand recipes given are simply practical expedients, not too closely\r\nscientific. My endeavour has been to supply practical and useful\r\ninformation in language as free from technicalities as possible, so as\r\nto adapt it to the ordinary miner, mill operator and prospector, many\r\nof whom have had no scientific training. Some of the expedients are\r\noriginal devices educed by what we are told is the mother of inventions;\r\nothers are hints given by practical old prospectors who had met with\r\ndifficulties which would be the despair of a man brought up within reach\r\nof forge, foundry, machine shop, or tradesmen generally. There are many\r\nhighly ingenious and useful contrivances besides these I have given.\r\n\r\nLIVING PLACES\r\n\r\nThe health of the prospector, especially in a new country, depends\r\nlargely on his housing--in which particular many men are foolishly\r\ncareless, for although they are aware that they will be camped out for\r\nlong periods, yet all the shelter they rely on is a miserable calico\r\ntent, often without a \"fly,\" while in some cases they sometimes even\r\nsleep on the wet, or dusty, ground. Such persons fully deserve the ill\r\nhealth which sooner or later overtakes them. A little forethought and\r\nvery moderate ingenuity would render their camp comparatively healthy\r\nand comfortable.\r\n\r\nIn summer the tent is the hottest, and in winter the coldest of\r\ndomiciles. The \"pizie\" or \"adobie\" hut, or, where practicable, the\r\n\"dugout,\" are much to be preferred, especially the latter. \"Pizie\" or\r\n\"adobie\" is simply surface soil kneaded with water and either moulded\r\nbetween boards like concrete, to construct the walls, or made into large\r\nsun-dried bricks. Salt water should not be used, as it causes the wall\r\nto be affected by every change of weather. A properly constructed house\r\nof this material, where the walls are protected by overhanging eaves,\r\nare practically everlasting, and the former have been standing for\r\ncenturies. There are buildings of pizie or adobie in Mexico, California\r\nand Australia which are as good as new, although the latter were built\r\nnearly a century ago.\r\n\r\nAdobie dwellings are warm in winter and cool in summer, and can be kept\r\nclean and healthy by occasional coatings of lime whitewash.\r\n\r\nThe dugout is even more simple in construction. A cutting, say ten feet\r\nwide, is put into the base of a hill for say twelve feet until the back\r\nwall is, say, ten feet high, the sides starting from nothing to that\r\nheight. The front and such portion as is required of the side walls are\r\nnext constructed of pizie or rough stone, with mud mortar, and the roof\r\neither gabled or skillion of bough, grass, or reed thatch, and covered\r\nwith pizie, over which is sometimes put another thin layer of thatch to\r\nprevent the pizie being washed away by heavy rain. Nothing can be more\r\nsnug and comfortable than such a house, unless the cows, as Mark Twain\r\nnarrates, make things \"monotonous\" by persistently tumbling down the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\nWhen the Burra copper mines were in full work in Australia, the banks of\r\nthe Burra Creek were honeycombed like a rabbit warren with the \"dugout\r\nhomes\" of the Cornish miners. The ruins of these old dugouts now extend\r\nfor miles, and look something like an uncovered Pompeii.\r\n\r\nWhen water is scarce and the tent has to be retained, much can be done\r\nto make the camp snug. I occupied a very comfortable camp once, of which\r\nmy then partner, a Dane, was the architect. We called it \"The Bungalow,\"\r\nand it was constructed as follows: First we set up our tent, 10 ft. by\r\n8 ft., formed of calico, but lined with green baize, and covered with a\r\nwell set fly.\r\n\r\nNext we put in four substantial forked posts about 10 ft. high and 15\r\nft. apart, with securely fixed cross pieces, and on the top was laid a\r\nrough flat roof of brush thatch; the sides were then treated in the same\r\nway, but not so thickly, being merely intended as a breakwind.\r\n\r\nThe tent with its two comfortable bunks was placed a little to one side,\r\nthe remaining space being used as a dining and sitting room all through\r\nthe summer. Except in occasional seasons of heavy rain, when we were\r\nsaved the trouble of washing our dishes, the tent was only used for\r\nsleeping purposes, and as a storehouse for clothes and perishable\r\nprovisions. I have \"dwelt in marble halls\" since then, but never was\r\nfood sweeter or sleep sounder than in the old bush bungalow.\r\n\r\nA BUSH BED\r\n\r\nTo make a comfortable bush bedplace, take four forked posts about 3 ft.\r\n6 in. long and 2 to 3 in. in diameter at the top; mark out your bedplace\r\naccurately and put a post at each corner, about 1 ft. in the ground.\r\nTake two poles about 7 ft. long, and having procured two strong\r\nfive-bushel corn sacks, cut holes in the bottom corners, put the poles\r\nthrough, bringing the mouths of the sacks together, and secure them\r\nthere with a strong stitch or two. Put your poles on the upright forked\r\nsticks, and you have a couch that even Sancho Panza would have envied.\r\nIt is as well to fix stretchers or cross stays between the posts at head\r\nand foot.\r\n\r\nIn malarial countries, sleeping on the ground is distinctly dangerous,\r\nand as such districts are usually thickly timbered, the Northern\r\nTerritory hammock is an admirable device, more particularly where\r\nmosquitoes abound.\r\n\r\nNORTHERN TERRITORY HAMMOCK\r\n\r\nThis hammock, which is almost a standing bedplace when rigged, is\r\nconstructed as follows:--To a piece of strong canvas 7 feet long and 2\r\n1/2 feet wide, put a broad hem, say 3 1/2 inches wide at each end. Into\r\nthis hem run a rough stick, about 2 feet 8 inches by 2 inches diameter.\r\nRound the centre of the stick pass a piece of strong three-quarter inch\r\nrope, 8 to 10 feet long and knot it, so as to leave a short end in\r\nwhich a metal eye is inserted. To each end of the two sticks a piece of\r\nquarter-inch lashing, about 6 feet long, is securely attached.\r\n\r\nTo make the mosquito covering take 18 feet of ordinary strong cheese\r\ncloth, and two pieces of strong calico of the same size as the canvas\r\nbed; put hems in the ends of the upper one large enough to take\r\nhalf-inch sticks, to all four extremities of which 8 feet of whipcord is\r\nto be attached. The calico forms the top and bottom of what we used to\r\ncall the \"meat safe,\" the sides being of cheese cloth. A small, flapped\r\nopening is left on the lower side. When once inside you are quite safe\r\nfrom mosquito bites.\r\n\r\nTo rig the above, two trees are chosen 7 to 8 feet apart, or two stayed\r\npoles can be erected if no trees are available. The bed is rigged about\r\n3 feet from the ground by taking the rope round the trees or poles, and\r\npulling the canvas taut by means of the metal eyelet. Then the lashings\r\nat the extremities of the sticks are fixed about 3 feet further up the\r\ntrees and you have a bed something between a hammock and a standing bed.\r\nThe mosquito net is fixed above the hammock in a similar manner, except\r\nthat it does not require the centre stay.\r\n\r\nAn old friend of mine once had a rather startling experience which\r\ncaused him to swear by the Northern Territory hammock. He was camped\r\nnear the banks of a muddy creek on the Daly River, and had fortunately\r\nhung his \"meat safe\" about four feet high. The night was very dark, and\r\nsome hours after retiring he heard a crash among his tin camp utensils,\r\nand the noise of some animal moving below him. Thinking his visitor was\r\na stray \"dingo,\" or wild dog, he gave a yell to frighten the brute away,\r\nand hearing it go, he calmly went to sleep again. Had he known who his\r\ncaller really was, he would not have felt so comfortable. In the\r\nmorning on the damp ground below, he found the tracks of a fourteen foot\r\nalligator, which was also out prospecting, but which, fortunately, had\r\nnot thought of investigating the \"meat safe.\"\r\n\r\nPURIFYING WATER\r\n\r\nThere is not a more fertile disease distributor, particularly in a new\r\ncountry, than water. The uninitiated generally take it for granted that\r\nso long as water looks clear it is necessarily pure and wholesome; as\r\na matter of fact the contrary is more usually the case, except in very\r\nwell watered countries, and such, as a rule, are not those in which gold\r\nis most plentifully got by the average prospector. I have seen foolish\r\nfellows, who were parched with a long tramp, drink water in quantity in\r\nwhich living organisms could be seen with the naked eye, without taking\r\neven the ordinary precaution of straining it through a piece of linen.\r\nIf they contracted hydatids, typhoid fever, or other ailments, which\r\nthin our mining camps of the strong, lusty, careless youths, who could\r\nwonder?\r\n\r\nThe best of all means of purifying water from organic substances is to\r\nboil it. If it be very bad, add carbon in the form of the charcoal from\r\nyour camp fire. If it be thick, you may, with advantage, add a little of\r\nthe ash also.\r\n\r\nI once rode forty-five miles with nearly beaten horses to a native\r\nwell, or rock hole, to find water, the next stage being over fifty miles\r\nfurther. The well was found, but the water in it was very bad; for in\r\nit was the body of a dead kangaroo which had apparently been there for\r\nweeks. The wretched horses, half frantic with thirst, did manage to\r\ndrink a few mouthfuls, but we could not. I filled our largest billycan,\r\nholding about a gallon, slung it over the fire and added, as the wood\r\nburnt down, charcoal, till the top was covered to a depth of two\r\ninches. With the charcoal there was, of course, a little ash containing\r\nbi-carbonate of potassium. The effect was marvellous. So soon as the\r\nhorrible soup came to the boil, the impurities coagulated, and after\r\nkeeping it at boiling temperature for about half an hour, it was removed\r\nfrom the fire, the cinders skimmed out, and the water allowed to settle,\r\nwhich it did very quickly. It was then decanted off into an ordinary\r\nprospector's pan, and some used to make tea (the flavour of which can be\r\nbetter imagined than described); the remainder was allowed to stand\r\nall night, a few pieces of charcoal being added. In the morning it was\r\nbright, clear, and absolutely sweet. This experience is worth knowing\r\nas many a bad attack of typhoid and other fevers would be averted if\r\npractical precautions of this kind were only used.\r\n\r\nTO OBTAIN WATER FROM ROOTS\r\n\r\nThe greatest necessity of animal life is water. There are, however,\r\nvast areas of the earth's surface where this most precious element is\r\nlamentably lacking, and such, unfortunately, is the case in many rich\r\nauriferous districts.\r\n\r\nTo the practical man there are many indications of water. These, of\r\ncourse, vary in different countries. Sometimes it is the herbage, but\r\nprobably, the best of all is the presence of carnivorous animals and\r\nbirds. These are never found far from water. In Australia the not\r\nover-loved wily old crow is a pretty sure indicator of water within\r\nreasonable distance--water may be extracted from the roots of the Mallee\r\n(_Eucalyptus dumosa_ and _gracilis_)--the Box (_Eucalyptus hemiphloia_)\r\nand the Water Bush (_Hakea leucoptera_). To extract it the roots are dug\r\nup, cut into lengths of about a foot, and placed upright in a can; the\r\nlower ends being a few inches above the bottom. It is simply astonishing\r\nhow much wholesome, if at times somewhat astringent, water may thus be\r\nobtained in a few hours, particularly at night.\r\n\r\n_Hakea leucoptera_. \"Pins and needles.\"--Maiden, in his work \"Useful\r\nNative Plants of Australia,\" says: \"In an experiment on a water-yielding\r\n_Hakea_, the first root, about half an inch in diameter and six or eight\r\nfeet long, yielded quickly, and in large drops about a wine-glass full\r\nof really excellent water.\"\r\n\r\nThis valuable, though not particularly ornamental shrub (for it never\r\nattains to the dimensions of a tree), is found, to the best of my\r\nbelief, in all parts of Australia, although it is said to be absent from\r\nWest Australia. As to this I don't feel quite sure. I have seen it \"from\r\nthe centre of the sea\" as far west as Streaky Bay, and believe I have\r\nseen it further West still. Considering the great similarity of much of\r\nthe flora of South Africa to that of Australia, it is probable that\r\nsome species of the water-bearing _Hakea_ might be found there. It can\r\nreadily be recognised by its acicular, needle-like leaves, and more\r\nparticularly by its peculiarly shaped seed vessel, which resembles the\r\npattern on an old-fashioned Indian shawl.\r\n\r\nIf the water found is too impure for drinking purposes and the\r\ntrouble arises from visible animalculae only, straining through a\r\npocket-handkerchief is better than nothing; the carbon filter is better\r\nstill; but nothing is so effective as boiling. A carbon filter is a tube\r\nwith a wad of compressed carbon inserted, through which the water is\r\nsucked, but as a rule clay-coloured water is comparatively innocuous,\r\nbut beware of the bright, limpid water of long stagnant rock\r\nwater-holes.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE AN EFFECTIVE FILTER\r\n\r\nTake a nail-can, keg, cask, or any other vessel, or even an ordinary\r\nwooden case (well tarred inside, if possible, to make it water-tight).\r\nMake a hole or several holes in the bottom, and set it over a tank or\r\nbucket. Into the bottom of the filter put (1) a few inches of washed\r\nbroken stone; (2) about four inches of charcoal; (3) say three inches\r\nof clean coarse sand (if not to hand you can manufacture it by crushing\r\nquartz with your pestle and mortar), and (4) alternate layers of\r\ncharcoal and sand until the vessel is half filled. Fill the top half\r\nwith water, and renew from time to time, and you have a filter which is\r\nas effective as the best London made article. _But it is better to boil\r\nyour water whether you filter afterwards or not._\r\n\r\nClear the inside of the water-cask frequently, and occasionally add\r\nto the water a little Condy's fluid, as it destroys organic matter. A\r\nuseful cement for stopping leaky places in casks is made as follows:\r\nTallow 25 parts, lard 40 parts, sifted wood ash 25 parts. Mix together\r\nby heating, and apply with a knife blade which has just been heated.\r\n\r\nCANVAS WATER BAGS\r\n\r\nAre easily made, and are very handy for carrying small supplies\r\nof drinking-water when prospecting in a dry country; they have the\r\nadvantage of keeping the water cool in the hottest weather, by reason on\r\nthe evaporation. The mouthpiece is made of the neck of a bottle securely\r\nsewn in.\r\n\r\nMEDICINE CASE\r\n\r\nMedicine is also a matter well worthy of thought. The author's worst\r\nenemy would not call him a mollycoddle, yet he has never travelled in\r\nfar wilds without carrying something in the way of medicine. First,\r\nthen, on this subject, it cannot be too often reiterated that if common\r\nEpsom salts were a guinea an ounce instead of a penny the medicine\r\nwould be valued accordingly, but it is somewhat bulky. What I especially\r\nrecommend, however, is a small pocket-case of the more commonly known\r\nhomeopathic remedies, \"Mother tinctures,\" which are small, light, and\r\nportable, with a small simple book of instructions. Though generally\r\nan allopath in practice, I once saved my own life, and have certainly\r\nhelped others by a little knowledge in diagnosing complaints and having\r\nsimple homeopathic remedies at hand to be used in the first stages of\r\nwhat might otherwise have been serious illnesses.\r\n\r\nPRODUCING FIRE\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard, and most believe, that fire may be easily produced\r\nby rubbing together two pieces of wood. I have seen it done by natives,\r\nbut they seldom make use of the operation, which is generally laborious,\r\npreferring to carry lighted fire sticks for miles. I have never\r\nsucceeded in the experiment.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, it is almost a matter of life or death to be able to\r\nproduce fire. The back of a pocket knife, or an old file with a fragment\r\nof flint, quartz, or pyrites struck smartly together over the remains of\r\na burnt piece of calico, will in deft hands produce a spark which can be\r\nfanned to a glow, and so ignite other material, till a fire is produced.\r\n\r\nAlso it may not be generally known that he who carries a watch carries\r\na \"burning glass\" with which he can, in clear weather, produce fire\r\nat will. All that is required is to remove the glass of your watch and\r\ncarefully three parts fill it with water (salt or fresh). This forms\r\na lens which, held steadily, will easily ignite any light, dry,\r\ninflammable substance.\r\n\r\nWhen firearms are carried, cut a cartridge so that only about a quarter\r\nof the charge of powder remains. Damp some powder and rub it on a small\r\npiece of dry cotton cloth or well-rubbed brown paper. Push a loose\r\npellet of this into the barrel, insert your half cartridge, fire at the\r\nground, when the wad will readily ignite, and can be blown into flame.\r\n\r\nTO COPY CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\nThe prospector is not usually a business man; hence in dealing with\r\nbusiness men who, like Hamlet, are \"indifferent honest,\" he frequently\r\ncomes to grief through not having a copy of his correspondence. It is\r\nmost desirable, therefore, either to carry a carbon paper duplicating\r\nbook and a stylus, or by adding a little sugar to good ordinary black\r\nink you may make a copying ink; then with the aid of a \"yellow back\"\r\noctavo novel, two pieces of board, and some ordinary tissue paper, you\r\nmay take a copy of any letter you send.\r\n\r\nTO PROVIDE A SIMPLE TELEGRAPHIC CODE\r\n\r\nBuy a couple of cheap small dictionaries of the same edition, send one\r\nto your correspondent with an intimation that he is to read up or down\r\nso many words from the one indicated when receiving a message. Thus,\r\nif I want to say \"Claim is looking well,\" I take a shilling dictionary,\r\nsend a copy to my correspondent with the intimation that the real word\r\nis seven down, and telegraph--\"Civilian looking weird;\" this, if looked\r\nup in Worcester's little pocket dictionary, for instance, will read\r\n\"Claim looking well.\" Any dictionary will do, so long as both parties\r\nhave a copy and understand which is the right word. By arrangement this\r\nplan can be varied from time to time if you have any idea that your code\r\ncan be read by others.\r\n\r\nA SERVICEABLE SOAP\r\n\r\nWood ashes from the camp fire are boiled from day to day in a small\r\nquantity of water, and allowed to settle, the clear liquid being\r\ndecanted off. When the required quantity of weak lye has been\r\naccumulated, evaporate by boiling, till a sufficient degree of strength\r\nhas been obtained. Now melt down some mutton fat, and, while hot, add to\r\nthe boiling lye. Continue boiling and stirring till the mixture is about\r\nthe consistency of thick porridge, pour into any convenient flat vessel,\r\nand let it stand till cool. If you have any resin in store, a little\r\npowdered and added gradually to the melting tallow, before mixing with\r\nthe lye, will stiffen your soap.\r\n\r\nTO CROSS A FLOODED STREAM\r\n\r\nTake a half-gallon, or larger, tin \"billy can,\" enclose it in a strong\r\ncotton handkerchief or cotton cloth, knotting same over the lid, invert,\r\nand, taking the knot in the hand, you have a floating appliance which\r\nwill sustain you in any water, whether you are a swimmer or not. The\r\nhigh silk hat of civilisation would act as well as the can, but these\r\nare not usually found far afield.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A HIDE BUCKET\r\n\r\nAt times when prospecting in an \"incline\" or \"underlay\" shaft,\r\nparticularly where the walls of the lode are irregular, a hide bucket\r\nwill be found preferable to an iron one. The mode of manufacture is as\r\nfollows: Procure an ox hide, \"green,\" if possible; if dry, it should\r\nbe soaked until quite soft. Cut some thin strips of hide for sewing or\r\nlacing. Now shape a bag or pocket of size sufficient to hold about\r\na hundredweight of stone, and by puncturing the edges with a knife,\r\nmarline-spike, or other pointed tool, sew together; make a handle of\r\ntwisted or pleated hide, and having filled your bucket with dry sand or\r\nearth let it stand till the whole is quite dry, when it will be properly\r\ndistended and will maintain its shape until worn out.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A \"SLUSH LAMP\"\r\n\r\nWhere candles are scarce and kerosine is not, a \"slush lamp\" is a useful\r\nsubstitute. Take an old but sound quart tin pannikin, half fill it with\r\nsand or earth, and prepare a thin stick of pine, round which wrap a\r\nstrip of soft cotton cloth. The stick should be about half an inch\r\nlonger than the depth of the pannikin. Melt some waste fat, fill the\r\npannikin therewith, push the stick down into the earth at the\r\nbottom, and you have a light, which, if not equal to the electric or\r\nincandescent gas burner, is quite serviceable. In Australia the soft\r\nvelvety core of the \"bottle brush,\" _Banksia marginata_, is often used\r\ninstead of the cotton wick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nRULES OF THUMB\r\n\r\nMINING APPLIANCES AND METHODS\r\n\r\nA TEMPORARY FORGE\r\n\r\nWhat prospector has not at times been troubled for the want of a forge?\r\nTo steel or harden a pick or sharpen a drill is comparatively easy,\r\nbut there is often a difficulty in getting a forge. Big single action\r\nbellows are sometimes bought at great expense, and some ingenious\r\nfellows have made an imitation of the blacksmith's bellows by means of\r\nsheepskins and rough boards.\r\n\r\nWith inadequate material and appliances to hand, the following will\r\nbe found easier to construct and more lasting when constructed. Only\r\na single piece of iron is required, and, at a pinch, one could even\r\ndispense with that by using a slab of talcose material, roughly shaping\r\na hearth therein and making a hole for the blast. First, construct a\r\nframing about the height of an ordinary smith's forge. This can made\r\nwith saplings and bark, or better still, if available, out of an empty\r\npacking case about three feet square. Fill the frame or case with\r\nslightly damped earth and ram it tight, leaving the usual hollow hearth.\r\nThen form a chamber below the perforated hearth opening to the rear.\r\nNow construct a centrifugal fan, such as is used for the ventilation of\r\nshallow shafts and workings. Set this up behind the hearth and revolve\r\nby means of a wooden multiplying wheel. A piece of ordinary washing line\r\nrope, or sash line rope, well resined if resin can be got--but pitch,\r\ntar, or wax will do by adding a little fine dust to prevent sticking--is\r\nused as a belt. With very rough materials a handy man can thus make a\r\nforge that will answer ordinary requirements.--N.B. Do not use clay for\r\nyour hearth bed unless you can get a highly aluminous clay, and can give\r\nit full time to dry before the forge fire is lit. Ordinary surface soil,\r\nnot too sandy, acts well, if damped and rammed thoroughly. Of course,\r\nif you can get an iron nozzle for your blower the whole operation is\r\nsimplified.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE WAY OF MAKING CHARCOAL\r\n\r\nDig a pit 5 feet square by 3 feet deep and fill with fuel. After\r\nlighting, see that the pit is kept full. The hot embers will gradually\r\nsink to the bottom. The fuel should be kept burning fiercely until the\r\npit seems almost full, when more fuel should be added, raising the heap\r\nabout a foot above the level of the ground. The earth dug out of the pit\r\nshould then be shovelled back over the burning mass. After leaving it to\r\ncool for 24 hours the pit will be found nearly full of charcoal. About\r\none-quarter the weight of the dry fuel used should be recovered in\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\nROUGH SMELTING ON THE MINE\r\n\r\nRough smelting on the mine is effected with a flux of borax, carbonate\r\nof soda, or, as I have often done, with some powdered white glass. When\r\nthe gold is smelted and the flux has settled down quietly in a liquid\r\nstate, the bulk of the latter may be removed, to facilitate pouring into\r\nthe mould, by dipping an iron rod alternately into the flux and then\r\ninto a little water, and knocking off the ball of congealed flux which\r\nadheres after each dip. This flux should, however, be crushed with a\r\npestle and mortar and panned off, as, in certain cases, it may contain\r\ntiny globules of gold.\r\n\r\nMISFIRES IN BLASTING\r\n\r\nOne of the most common sources of accident in mining operations is due\r\neither to carelessness or to the use of defective material in blasting.\r\nA shot misses, generally for one of two reasons; either the explosive,\r\nthe cap, or the fuse (most often the latter), is inferior or defective;\r\nor the charging is incompletely performed. Sometimes the fuse is not\r\nplaced properly in the detonator, or the detonator is not properly\r\nenclosed in the cartridge, or the fuse is injured by improper tamping.\r\nIf several shots have been fired together, particularly at the change\r\nof a \"shift,\" the men who have to remove the broken material may in so\r\ndoing explode the missed charge. Or, more inexcusable still, men will\r\noften be so foolish as to try to clear out the drill hole and remove\r\nthe missed cartridge. When a charge is known to have missed all that\r\nis necessary to do in order to discharge it safely is to remove a few\r\ninches of \"tamping\" from the top of the drill hole, place in the bore\r\na plug of dynamite with cap and fuse attached, put an inch or two of\r\ntamping over it and fire, when the missed charge will also be exploded.\r\nOf course, judgment must be used and the depth of the drill taken into\r\nconsideration. As a rule, miners use far more tamping than is at all\r\nrequisite. The action of the charge will generally be found quite as\r\neffective with a few inches of covering matter as with a foot or more,\r\nwhile the exploding of misfire cartridges is rendered simple, as no\r\nremoval of tamping is required before placing the top \"plug\" in case of\r\nmisfire.\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT LOSS OF RICH SPECIMENS IN BLASTING\r\n\r\nWhen blasting the cap of a lode, particularly on rich shutes of gold,\r\nthe rock is apt to fly, and rich specimens may be thrown far afield and\r\nso be lost. A simple way of avoiding this is to procure a quantity\r\nof boughs, which tie into loose bundles, placing the leafy parts\r\nalternately end for end. Before firing, pile these bundles over the\r\nblast and, if care is used, very few stones will fly. The same device\r\nmay be used in wide shallow shafts.\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE MODE OF RETORTING SMALL QUANTITIES OF AMALGAM\r\n\r\nClean your amalgam and squeeze it as hard as possible through strong\r\ncalico or chamois leather. Take a large sound potato, cut off about a\r\nquarter from one end and scoop out a hole in the centre about twice as\r\nbig as the ball of amalgam. Procure a piece of flat iron--an old spade\r\nwill do as well as anything--insert the amalgam, and, having placed the\r\npotato, cut side downwards, thereon, put the plate of iron on the forge,\r\nheat up first gently, then stronger, till separation has taken place,\r\nwhen the gold will be found in a bright clean button on the plate\r\nand the mercury in fine globules in the potato, from which it can be\r\nre-collected by breaking up the partly or wholly cooked tuber under\r\nwater in an enamelled or ordinary crockery basin.\r\n\r\nTO RETORT SMALL QUANTITIES OF MERCURY FOR AMALGAMATING ASSAY TESTS\r\n\r\nGet two new tobacco pipes similar in shape, with the biggest bowls and\r\nlongest stems procurable. Break off the stem of one close to the bowl\r\nand fill the hole with well worked clay (some battery slimes make the\r\nbest luting clay). Set the stemless pipe on end in a clay bed, and fill\r\nwith amalgam, pass a bit of thin iron or copper wire beneath it,\r\nand bend the ends of the wire upwards. Now fit the whole pipe, bowl\r\ninverted, on to the under one, luting the edges of both well with clay.\r\nTwist the wire over the top with a pair of nippers till the two bowls\r\nare fitted closely together, and you have a retort that will stand any\r\nheat necessary to thoroughly distil mercury.\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE MODE OF ASCERTAINING THE NOMINAL HORSE-POWER OF AN ENGINE\r\n\r\nMultiply the internal diameter of the cylinder by itself and strike off\r\nthe last figure of the quotient. The diameter is\r\n\r\n     20\" X 20\"\r\n     20\r\n     ____\r\n     400. The H.P. is 40.\r\n\r\nThe following rules will be found more professionally accurate from\r\nan engineering standpoint, though the term \"horse-power\" is not now\r\ngenerally employed.\r\n\r\n_To find the Nominal Horse-power_.--For _non-condensing_ engines:\r\nMultiply the square of the diameter of the cylinder in inches by 7 and\r\ndivide the product by 80. For _condensing_ engines: Multiply the square\r\nof the diameter of the cylinder in inches by 7 and divide the product by\r\n200.\r\n\r\n_To find the Actual Horse-power_ of an engine, multiply the area of the\r\ncylinder in square inches by the average effective pressure in pounds\r\nper square inch, less 3 lb. per square inch as the frictional allowance,\r\nand also by the speed of the piston in feet per minute, dividing the\r\nproduct by 33,000, and the quotient will be the actual horse-power.\r\n\r\n\"SCALING\" COPPER PLATES\r\n\r\nTo \"scale\" copper plates they may be put over a charcoal or coke fire\r\nto slowly sublimate the quicksilver. Where possible, the fireplace of\r\na spare boiler can be utilised, using a thin red fire. After the entire\r\nevaporation of the quicksilver the plates should be slowly cooled,\r\nrubbed with hydrochloric acid, and put in a damp place overnight, then\r\nrubbed with a solution of sal ammoniac and nitre in equal parts, and\r\nagain heated slowly over a red fire. They must not be allowed to get red\r\nhot; the proper degree of heat is indicated by the gold scale rising\r\nin blisters, when the plates should be taken from the fire and the gold\r\nscraped off. Any part of the plate on which the gold has not blistered\r\nshould be again rubbed with the solution and fired. The gold scale\r\nshould be collected in a glass or earthen dish and covered with nitric\r\nacid, till all the copper is dissolved, when the gold can be smelted in\r\nthe usual way; but after it is melted corrosive sublimate should be put\r\nin the crucible till a blue flame ceases to be given off.\r\n\r\n_A Second Method_\r\n\r\nThe simplest plan I know is to have a hole dug nine inches deep by about\r\nthe size of the plate to be scaled; place a brick at each corner, and\r\non each side, halfway between, get up a good fire; let it burn down to\r\nstrong embers, or use charcoal, then place the plate on three bars of\r\niron extending between the three pairs of bricks, have a strong solution\r\nof borax ready in which soak strips of old \"table blanket,\" laying these\r\nover the plate and sprinkling them with the borax solution when the\r\nplate gets too hot. After a time the deposit of mercury and gold on\r\nthe plate will assume a white, efflorescent appearance, and may then be\r\nreadily parted from the copper.\r\n\r\n_Another Method_\r\n\r\nHeat the plate over an open fire, to drive off the mercury; after which,\r\nlet it cool, and saturate with dilute sulphuric acid for three hours,\r\nor longer; then sprinkle over the surface a mixture of equal parts of\r\ncommon salt and sal ammoniac, and heat to redness; then cool, and the\r\ngold scale comes off freely; the scale is then boiled in nitric or\r\nsulphuric acid, to remove the copper, previous to melting. Plates may be\r\nscaled about once in six months, and will under ordinary circumstances\r\nproduce about one ounce of clean gold for each superficial foot of\r\ncopper surface employed. I always paint the back of the plate with\r\na mixture of boiled oil and turpentine, or beeswax dissolved in\r\nturpentine, to prevent the acid attacking the copper.\r\n\r\nHOW TO SUPPLY MERCURY TO MORTAR BOXES\r\n\r\nI am indebted for the following to Mr. J. M. Drake, who, speaking of his\r\nexperience on the Wentworth Mine, N.S.W., says:\r\n\r\n\"Fully 90 per cent of the gold is saved on the outside plates, only a\r\nsmall quantity remaining in the mortar. The plates have a slope of 2\r\nin. to 1 ft. No wells are used, the amalgam traps saving any quicksilver\r\nwhich may leach off the plates. The quicksilver is added every hour\r\nin the mortar. The quantity is regulated by the mill manager in the\r\nfollowing manner: Three pieces of wood, 8 in. wide by 12 in. long by 2\r\nin. thick, have 32 holes 1 in. deep bored in each of them. These holes\r\nwill just take a small 2 oz. phial. The mill manager puts the required\r\nquantity of quicksilver in each bottle and the batteryman empties one\r\nbottle in each mortar every hour; and puts it back in the hole upside\r\ndown. Each block of wood lasts eight hours, the duration of one man's\r\nshift.\" This of course is for a 20-head mill with four mortars or\r\n\"boxes.\"\r\n\r\nI commend this as an excellent mode of supplying the mercury to the\r\nboxes or mortars. The quantity to be added depends on circumstances. A\r\ncareless battery attendant will often put in too much or too little\r\nwhen working without the automatic feeder. I have known an attendant\r\non suddenly awaking to the fact half through his shift, that he had\r\nforgotten to put in any mercury, to then empty into the stamper box two\r\nor three pounds weight; with what effect may be easily surmised.\r\n\r\nHOW WATER SHOULD ENTER STAMPER BOXES\r\n\r\nThe following extract which relates to Californian Gold Mill practices\r\nis from Bulletin No. 6 of the California State Mining Bureau. I quite\r\nagree with the practice.\r\n\r\n\"The battery water should enter both sides of the mortar in an even\r\nquantity, and should be sufficient to keep a fairly thick pulp which\r\nwill discharge freely through the grating or screen. About 120 cubic\r\nfeet of water per ton of crushed ore may be considered an average, or 8\r\nto 10 cubic feet per stamp per hour.\r\n\r\n\"Screens of different materials and with different orifices are used;\r\nthe materials comprise wire cloth of brass or steel, tough Russian sheet\r\niron, English tinned plate, and, quite recently, aluminium bronze. The\r\n'aluminium bronze' plates are much longer lived than either of the other\r\nkinds, and have the further advantage that, when worn out, they can be\r\nsold for the value of the metal for remelting; these plates are bought\r\nand sold by the pound, and are said to contain 95 per cent of copper and\r\n5 per cent of aluminium. Steel screens are not so much used, on account\r\nof their liability to rust.\"\r\n\r\nI have had no experience with the aluminium bronze screen. I presume,\r\nhowever, that it is used only for mills where mercury is not put in the\r\nmortars, otherwise, it would surely become amalgamated. The same remark\r\napplies to brass wire cloth and tinned plate. Unless the metal of which\r\nthey are composed will not readily amalgamate with mercury, I should be\r\nchary of using new screen devices. Mercury is a most insidious metal\r\nand is often found most unexpectedly in places in the battery where\r\nit should not be. Probably aluminium steel would be better than any\r\nsubstance mentioned. It would be hard, light, strong, and not readily\r\ncorrodible. I am not aware if it has been tried.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of \"Power for Mills\" the following is taken from the\r\nsame source.\r\n\r\nPOWER FOR MILLS\r\n\r\n\"As the Pelton wheel seems to find the most frequent application in\r\nCalifornia, it may be convenient for millmen to have the following rule,\r\napplicable to these wheels:\r\n\r\n\"When the head of water is known in feet, multiply it by 0.0024147,\r\nand the product is the horse-power obtainable from one miner's inch of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"The power necessary for different mill parts is:\r\n\r\n     For each 850lb. stamp, dropping 6 in. 95 times per minute,\r\n          1.33 h.-p.\r\n     For each 750lb. stamp, dropping 6 in. 95 times per minute,\r\n          1.18 h.-p.\r\n     For each 650lb. stamp, dropping 6 in. 95 times per minute,\r\n          1.00 h.-p.\r\n     For an 8-inch by 10-inch Blake pattern rock-breaker\r\n          9.00 h.-p.\r\n     For a Frue or Triumph vanner, with 220 revolutions per min.\r\n          0.50 h.-p.\r\n     For a 4-feet clean-up pan, making 30 revolutions per min.\r\n          1.50 h.-p.\r\n     For an amalgamating barrel, making 30 revolutions per min.\r\n          2.50 h.-p.\r\n     For a mechanical batea, making 30 revolutions per min.\r\n          1.00 h.-p.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer has had small practical experience of the working of that\r\nexcellent hydraulic motor, the Pelton wheel, but if by horse-power in\r\nthe table given is meant nominal horse-power, it appears to be high.\r\nWorking with 800 cwt. stamps, 80 blows a minute, one horse-power nominal\r\nwill be found sufficient with any good modern engine, which has no\r\nfurther burden than raising the stamps and pumping the feed water. It is\r\nalways well, however, particularly when providing engine power, to err\r\non the right side, and make provision for more than is absolutely needed\r\nfor actual battery requirements. This rule applies with equal potency to\r\npumping engines.\r\n\r\nTO AVOID LOSS IN CLEANING UP\r\n\r\nThe following is a hint to quartz mill managers with respect to that\r\ncommon source of loss of gold involved in the almost inevitable loss\r\nof mercury in cleaning up operations. I have known hundreds of pounds'\r\nworth of gold to be recovered from an old quartz mill site by the simple\r\nprocess of washing up the ground under the floor.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot afford to floor the whole of the battery with smooth\r\nconcrete, at all events smoothly concrete the floor of the cleaning-up\r\nroom, and let the floor slope towards the centre: where a sink is\r\nprovided. Any lost mercury must thus find its way to the centre, where\r\nit will collect and can be panned off from time to time. Of course an\r\nunderground drain and mercury trap must be provided.\r\n\r\nIRON EXTRACTOR\r\n\r\nWhen using self-feeders, fragments of steel tools are especially liable\r\nto get into the battery boxes or other crushing appliance where they\r\nsometimes cause great mischief. I believe the following plan would be a\r\npracticable remedy for this evil.\r\n\r\nBy a belt from the cam or counter shaft, cause a powerful electric\r\nmagnet to extract all magnetic particles; then, by a simple ratchet\r\nmovement, at intervals withdraw the magnet and drop the adhering\r\nfragments into a receptacle by automatically switching off the electric\r\ncurrent. A powerful ordinary horseshoe magnet might probably do just as\r\nwell, but would require to be re-magnetised from time to time.\r\n\r\nTO SILVER COPPER PLATES\r\n\r\nTo silver copper plates, that is, to amalgamate them on the face with\r\nmercury, is really a most simple operation, though many batterymen make\r\na great mystery of it. Indeed, when I first went into a quartz mill the\r\nprocess deemed necessary was not only a very tedious one, but very dirty\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nTo amalgamate with silver, in fact, to silver-plate your copper without\r\nresort to the electro-plating bath, take any old silver (failing that,\r\nsilver coin will do, but is more expensive), and dissolve it in somewhat\r\ndilute nitric acid, using only just sufficient acid as will assist the\r\nprocess. After some hours place the ball of amalgam in a piece of strong\r\nnew calico and squeeze out any surplus mercury.\r\n\r\nAbout an ounce of silver to the foot of copper is sufficient. To apply\r\nit on new plates use nitric acid applied with a swab to free the surface\r\nof the copper from oxides or impurities, then rub the ball of amalgam\r\nover the surface using some little force. It is always well when coating\r\ncopper plates with silver or zinc by means of mercury to let them stand\r\ndry for a day or two before using, as the mercury oxidises and the\r\ncoating metal more closely adheres.\r\n\r\nOnly the very best copper plate procurable should be used for battery\r\ntables; bad copper will always give trouble, both in the first \"curing,\"\r\nand after treatment. It should not be heavily rolled copper, as the\r\nmore porous the metal the more easily will the mercury penetrate and\r\namalgamate. I cannot agree that any good is attained by scouring the\r\nplates with sand and alkalies, as recommended in some books on the\r\nsubject; on the contrary, I prefer the opposite mode of treatment, and\r\neither face the plates with nitrate of silver and nitrate of mercury,\r\nor else with sulphate of zinc and mercury, in the form of what is\r\ncalled zinc amalgam. If mine water, which often contains a little free\r\nsulphuric acid, is being used, the latter plan is preferable.\r\n\r\nThe copper should be placed smoothly on the wooden table and secured\r\nfirmly thereto by copper tacks. If the plate should be bent or buckled,\r\nit may be flattened by beating it with a heavy hammer, taking care to\r\ninterpose a piece of inch-thick soft wood between hammer and plate.\r\n\r\nTo coat with mercury only, procure some nitrate of mercury. This is\r\neasily made by placing mercury in an earthenware bowl, pouring somewhat\r\ndilute nitric acid on it, and letting it stand till the metallic mercury\r\nis changed to a white crystal. Dense reddish-brown fumes will arise,\r\nwhich are injurious if breathed, so the operation should be conducted\r\neither in the open air, or where there is a draught.\r\n\r\nHaving your silvering solution ready, which is to be somewhat diluted\r\nwith water, next take two swabs, with handles about 12 inches long, dip\r\nthe first into a basin containing dilute nitric acid, and rub it rapidly\r\nover about a foot of the surface of the plate; the oxide of copper will\r\nbe absolutely removed, and the surface of the copper rendered pure and\r\nbright; then take the other swab, wet with the dilute nitric of mercury,\r\nand pass it over the clean surface, rubbing it well in. Continue this\r\ntill the whole plate has a coating of mercury. It may be well to go\r\nover it more than once. Now turn on the water and wash the plate clean,\r\nsprinkle with metallic mercury, rubbing it upwards until the plate will\r\nhold no more.\r\n\r\nA basin with nitrate of mercury may be kept handy, and the plates\r\ntouched up from time to time for a few days until they get amalgamated\r\nwith gold, after which, unless you have much base metal to contend with,\r\nthey will give no further trouble.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that an excessive use of nitric acid\r\nwill result in waste of mercury, which will be carried off in a milky\r\nstream with the water; and also that it will cause the amalgam to become\r\nvery hard, and less active in attracting other particles of gold.\r\n\r\nIf you are treating the plate with nitrate of silver prepared as already\r\nmentioned, clean the plate with dilute nitric acid, rub the surface with\r\nthe ball of amalgam, following with the swab and fairly rubbing in. It\r\nwill be well to prepare the plate some days before requiring to use\r\nit, as a better adhesion of the silver and copper takes place than if\r\nmercury is applied at once.\r\n\r\nTo amalgamate with zinc amalgam, clean the copper plate by means of a\r\nswab, with fairly strong sulphuric acid diluted with water; then while\r\nwet apply the zinc-mercury mixture and well rub in. To prepare the\r\nzinc-amalgam, clip some zinc (the lining of packing cases will do)\r\ninto small pieces and immerse them in mercury after washing them with\r\na little weak sulphuric acid and water to remove any coating of oxide.\r\nWhen the mercury will absorb no more zinc, squeeze through chamois\r\nleather or calico (as for silver amalgam), and well rub in. The plate\r\nthus prepared should stand for a few days, dry, before using. If, before\r\namalgamation with gold takes place, oxide of copper or other scum should\r\nrise on this plate a little very dilute sulphuric acid will instantly\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\nSodium and cyanide of potassium are frequently used in dressing-plates,\r\nbut the former should be very sparingly employed, as it will often\r\ndo more harm than good by taking up all sorts of base metals with the\r\namalgam, and so presenting a surface which the gold will pass over\r\nwithout adhering to. Where water is scarce, and is consequently used\r\nover and over again, lime may be added to the pulp, or, if lime is not\r\nprocurable, wood ashes may be used. The effect is two-fold; the lime\r\nnot only tends to \"sweeten\" sulphide ores and keep the tables clean,\r\nbut also causes the water to cleanse itself more quickly of the slimes,\r\nwhich will be more rapidly precipitated. When zinc amalgam is used,\r\nalkalies would, of course, be detrimental.\r\n\r\nWhen no other water than that from the mine is available, difficulties\r\noften arise owing to the impurities it contains. These are various,\r\nbut among the most common are the soluble sulphates, and sometimes free\r\nsulphuric acid evolved by the oxidisation of metallic sulphides. In the\r\npresence of this difficulty, do one of two things; either _utilise_ or\r\n_neutralise_. In certain cases, I recommend the former. Sometime since\r\nI was treating, for gold extraction, material from a mine which was very\r\ncomplex in character, and for which I coined the term \"polysynthetic.\"\r\nThis contained about half a dozen different sulphides. The upper parts\r\nof the lode being partially oxidised, free sulphuric acid (H2SO4) was\r\nevolved. I therefore, following out a former discovery, added a little\r\nmetallic zinc to the mercury in the boxes and on the plates with\r\nexcellent results. When the free acid in the ore began to give out in\r\nthe lower levels I added minute quantities of sulphuric acid to the\r\nwater from time to time. I have since found, however, that with some\r\nwater, particularly West Australian, the reaction is so feeble (probably\r\nowing to the lime and magnesia present) as to make this mode of\r\ntreatment unsuitable.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A DOLLY\r\n\r\nI have seen some rather elaborate dollies, intended to be worked with\r\namalgamating tables, but the usual prototype of the quartz mill is\r\nset up, more or less, as follows: A tree stump, from 9 in. to a foot\r\ndiameter, is levelled off smoothly at about 2 ft. from the ground; on\r\nthis is firmly fixed a circular plate of 1/2 in. iron, say 9 in. in\r\ndiameter; a band of 3/16 in. iron, about 8 or 9 in. in height, fits\r\nmore or less closely round the plate. This is the battery box. A beam\r\nof heavy wood, about 3 in. diameter and 6 ft. long, shod with iron,\r\nis vertically suspended, about 9 in. above the stump, from a flexible\r\nsapling with just sufficient spring in it to raise the pestle to the\r\nrequired height. About 2 ft. from the bottom the hanging beam is pierced\r\nwith an augur hole and a rounded piece of wood, 1 1/2 in. by 18 in.,\r\nis driven through to serve as a handle for the man who is to do the\r\npounding. His mate breaks the stone to about 2 in. gauge and feeds the\r\nbox, lifting the ring from time to time to sweep off the triturated\r\ngangue, which he screens through a sieve into a pan and washes off,\r\neither by means of a cradle or simply by panning. In dollying it\r\ngenerally pays to burn the stone, as so much labour in crushing is thus\r\nsaved. A couple of small kilns to hold about a ton each dug out of a\r\nclay bank will be found to save fuel where firewood is scarce, and will\r\nmore thoroughly burn the stone and dissipate the base metals, but it\r\nmust be remembered that gold from burnt stone is liable to become so\r\nencrusted with the base metal oxides as to be difficult to amalgamate.\r\n\r\nROUGH WINDLASS\r\n\r\nMake two St. Andrew's crosses with four saplings, the upper angle being\r\nshorter than the lower; fix these upright, one at each end of the shaft;\r\nstay them together by cross pieces till you have constructed something\r\nlike a \"horse,\" such as is used for sawing wood, the crutch being a\r\nlittle over 3 feet high. Select a leg for a windlass barrel, about 6 in.\r\ndiameter and a foot longer than the distance between the supports, as\r\nstraight as is procurable; cut in it two circular slots about an inch\r\ndeep by 2 in. wide to fit into the forks; at one end cut a straight slot\r\n2 in. deep across the face. Now get a crooked bough, as nearly the shape\r\nof a handle as nature has produced it, and trim it into right angular\r\nshape, fit one end into the barrel, and you have a windlass that will\r\npull up many a ton of stuff.\r\n\r\nPUDDLER\r\n\r\nThis is made by excavating a circular hole about 2 ft. 9 in. deep and,\r\nsay 12 ft. in diameter. An outer and inner wall are then constructed of\r\nslabs 2 ft. 6 in. in height to ground level, the outer wall being thus\r\n30 ft. and the inner 15 ft. in circumference. The circular space between\r\nis floored with smooth hardwood slabs or boards, and the whole made\r\nsecure and water-tight. In the middle of the inner enclosure a\r\nstout post is planted, to stand a few inches above the wall, and the\r\nsurrounding space is filled up with clay rammed tight. A strong iron pin\r\nis inserted in the centre of the post, on which is fitted a revolving\r\nbeam, which hangs across the whole circumference of the machine\r\nand protrudes a couple of feet or so on each side. To this beam are\r\nattached, with short chains, a couple of drags made like V-shaped\r\nharrows by driving a piece of red iron through a heavy frame, shaped as\r\na rectangular triangle.\r\n\r\nTo one end of the beam an old horse is attached, who, as he slowly walks\r\nround the circular track, causes the harrows and drags to so puddle\r\nthe washdirt and water in the great wooden enclosure that the clay is\r\ngradually disintegrated, and flows off with the water which is from time\r\nto time admitted. The clean gravel is then run through a \"cradle,\" \"long\r\nTom,\" or \"sluice,\" and the gold saved. This, of course, is the simplest\r\nform of gold mining. In the great alluvial mines other and more\r\nintricate appliances are used but the principle of extraction is the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nA MAKESHIFT PUMP\r\n\r\nTo make a temporary small \"draw-lift\" pump, which will work down to\r\na hundred feet or more if required, take a large size common suction\r\nDouglas pump, and, after removing the top and handle, fix the pump as\r\nclose to the highest level of the water in the shaft as can be arranged.\r\nNow make a square water-tight wooden column of slightly greater capacity\r\nthan the suction pipe, fix this to the top of the pump, and by means\r\nof wooden rods, work the whole from the surface, using either a longer\r\nlevered handle or, with a little ingenuity, horse-power. If you can\r\nget it the iron downpipe used to carry the water from the guttering of\r\nhouses is more easily adapted for the pipe column; then, also, iron pump\r\nrods can be used but I have raised water between 60 and 70 feet with a\r\nlarge size Douglas pump provided only with a wooden column and rods.\r\n\r\nSQUEEZING AMALGAM\r\n\r\nFor squeezing amalgam, strong calico, not too coarse, previously soaked\r\nin clean water, is quite as good as ordinary chamois leather. Some gold\r\nis fine enough to escape through either.\r\n\r\nMERCURY EXTRACTOR\r\n\r\nThe mercury extractor or amalgam separator is a machine which is very\r\nsimple in construction, and is stated to be most efficient in extracting\r\nquicksilver from amalgam, as it requires but from two to three minutes\r\nto extract the bulk of the mercury from one hundred pounds of amalgam,\r\nleaving the amalgam drier than when strained in the ordinary way by\r\nsqueezing through chamois leather or calico. The principle is that\r\nof the De Laval cream separator--i.e., rapid centrifugal motion.\r\nThe appliance is easily put together, and as easily taken apart. The\r\ncylinder is made of steel, and is run at a very high rate of speed.\r\n\r\nThe general construction of the appliance is as follows: The casing or\r\nreceiver is a steel cylinder, which has a pivot at the bottom to receive\r\nthe step for an upright hollow shaft, to which a second cylinder of\r\nsmaller diameter is attached. The second cylinder is perforated, and\r\na fine wire cloth is inserted. The mercury, after passing through the\r\ncloth, is discharged through the perforations. When the machine\r\nis revolved at great speed, the mercury is forced into the outside\r\ncylinder, leaving the amalgam, which has been first placed in a calico\r\nor canvas bag, in a much drier state than it could be strained by hand.\r\nWhile not prepared to endorse absolutely all that is claimed for this\r\nappliance, I consider that it has mechanical probability on its side,\r\nand that where large quantities of amalgam have to be treated it will be\r\nfound useful and effective.\r\n\r\nSLUICE PLATES\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. F. W. Drake for the following account of sluice\r\nplates, which I have never tried, but think the device worth attention:\r\n\r\n\"An addition has been made to the gold-saving appliances by the placing\r\nof what are called in America, 'sluice plates' below the ordinary table.\r\nThe pulp now flows over an amalgamating surface, 14 ft. long by 4 ft.\r\nwide, sloping 1 1/2 in. to the foot, and is then contracted into a\r\ncopper-plated sluice 15 ft. long by 14 in. wide, having a fall of 1 in.\r\nto the foot. Our mill manager (Mr. G. C. Knapp) advocated these sluice\r\nplates for a long time before I would consent to a trial. I contended\r\nthat as we got little or no amalgam from the lower end of our table\r\nplates there was no gold going away capable of being recovered by copper\r\nplates; and even if it were, narrow sluice plates were a step in the\r\nwrong direction. If anything the amalgamating surface should be widened\r\nto give the particles of gold a better chance to settle. His argument\r\nwas that the conditions should be changed; by narrowing the stream and\r\ngiving it less fall, gold, which was incapable of amalgamation on the\r\nwide plates, would be saved. We finally put one in, and it proved\r\nso successful that we now have one at the end of each table. The\r\nper-centage recovered on the sluice plates, of the total yield, varies,\r\nand has been as follows:--October, 9.1 per cent; November, 6.9 per cent;\r\nDecember, 6.4 per cent; January, 4.3 per cent; February, 9.3 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nMEASURING INACCESSIBLE DISTANCES\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the width of a difficult gorge, a deep river, or\r\ntreacherous swamp without crossing and measuring, sight a conspicuous\r\nobject at the edge of the bank on the farther side; then as nearly\r\nopposite and square as possible plant a stake about five feet high, walk\r\nalong the nearer margin to what you guess to be half the distance across\r\n(exactitude in this respect is not material to the result), there plant\r\nanother stake, and continuing in a straight line put in a third. The\r\nstakes must be equal distances apart and as nearly as possible at a\r\nright angle to the first line. Now, carrying in hand a fourth stake,\r\nstrike a line inland at right angles to the base and as soon as sighting\r\nover the fourth stake, you can get the fourth and second stakes and\r\nthe object on the opposite shore in line your problem is complete. The\r\ndistance between No. 4 and No. 3 stakes is the same as that between No.\r\n1 and the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nTO SET OUT A RIGHT ANGLE WITH A TAPE\r\n\r\nMeasure 40 ft. on the line to which you wish to run at right angles, and\r\nput pegs at A and B; then, with the end of the tape held carefully at\r\nA, take 80 ft., and have the 80 ft. mark held at B. Take the 50 ft. mark\r\nand pull from A and B until the tape lies straight and even, you will\r\nthen have the point C perpendicular to AB. Continue straight lines by\r\nsighting over two sticks in the well-known way.\r\n\r\n_Another method_.--Stick a pin in each corner of a square board, and\r\nlook diagonally across them, first in the direction of the line to which\r\nyou wish to run at right angles, and then for the new line sight across\r\nthe other two pins.\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE LEVELLING INSTRUMENT\r\n\r\nFasten a common carpenter's square in a slit to the top of a stake by\r\nmeans of a screw, and then tie a plumb-line at the angle so that it\r\nmay hang along the short arm, when the plumb-line hangs vertically\r\nand sights may be taken over it. A carpenter's spirit-level set on an\r\nadjustable stand will do as well. The other arm will then be a level.\r\n\r\nAnother very simple, but effective, device for finding a level line is\r\nby means of a triangle of wood made of half-inch boards from 9 to 12\r\nft. long. To make the legs level, set the triangle up on fairly level\r\nground, suspend a plummet from the top and mark on the cross-piece where\r\nthe line touches it. Then reverse the triangle, end for end, exactly,\r\nand mark the new line the plumb-line makes. Now make a new mark exactly\r\nhalf way between the two, and when the plumb-line coincides with this,\r\nthe two legs are standing on level ground. For short water races this is\r\na very handy method of laying out a level line.\r\n\r\nTO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF A STANDING TREE\r\n\r\nTake a stake about your own height, and walking from the butt of the\r\ntree to what you judge to be the height of the timber portion you want,\r\ndrive your stake into the ground till the top is level with your eyes;\r\nnow lie straight out on your back, placing your feet against the stake,\r\nand sight a point on the tree. AB equals BC. If BC is, say 40 ft., that\r\nwill be the height of your \"stick of timber.\" Thus, much labour may be\r\nsaved in felling trees the timber portion of which may afterwards be\r\nfound to be too short for your purpose.\r\n\r\nLEVELLING BY ANEROID BAROMETER\r\n\r\nThis should be used more for ascertaining relatively large differences\r\nin altitudes than for purposes where any great nicety is required.\r\nFor hills under 2000 ft., the following rule will give a very close\r\napproximation, and is easily remembered, because 55 degrees, the assumed\r\ntemperature, agrees with 55 degrees, the significant figures in the\r\n55,000 factor, while the fractional correction contains _two fours_.\r\n\r\nObserve the altitudes and also the temperatures on the Fahrenheit\r\nthermometer at top and bottom respectively, of the hill, and take the\r\nmean between them. Let B represent the mean altitude and b the mean\r\ntemperature. Then 55000 X B - b/B + b = height of the hill in feet for\r\nthe temperature of 55 degrees. Add 1/440 of this result for every degree\r\nthe mean temperature exceeds 55 degrees; or subtract as much for every\r\ndegree below 55 degrees.\r\n\r\nTO DETERMINE HEIGHTS OF OBJECTS\r\n\r\n_By Shadows_\r\n\r\nSet up vertically a stick of known length, and measure the length of its\r\nshadow upon a horizontal or other plane; measure also the length of\r\nthe shadow thrown by the object whose height is required. Then it will\r\nbe:--As the length of the stick's shadow is to the length of the stick\r\nitself, so is the length of the shadow of the object to the object's\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n_By Reflection_\r\n\r\nPlace a vessel of water upon the ground and recede from it until you see\r\nthe top of the object reflected from the surface of the water. Then it\r\nwill be:--As your horizontal distance from the point of reflection is\r\nto the height of your eye above the reflecting surface, so is the\r\nhorizontal distance of the foot of the object from the vessel to its\r\naltitude above the said surface.\r\n\r\n_Instrumentally_\r\n\r\nRead the vertical angle, and multiply its natural tangent by the\r\ndistance between instrument and foot of object; the result is the\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nWhen much accuracy is not required vertical angles can be measured by\r\nmeans of a quadrant of simple construction. The arc AB is a quadrant,\r\ngraduated in degrees from B to A; C, the point from which the plummet P\r\nis suspended, being the centre of the quadrant.\r\n\r\n_When_ the sights AC are directed towards any object, S, the degrees\r\nin the arc, BP, are the measure of the angle of elevation, SAD, of the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nTO FIND THE DEPTH OF A SHAFT\r\n\r\n_Rule_:--Square the number of seconds a stone takes to reach the bottom\r\nand multiply by 16.\r\n\r\nThus, if a stone takes 5 seconds to fall to the bottom of a shaft--\r\n\r\n5 squared = 25; and 25 X 16 = 400 feet, the required depth of shaft.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLAN FOR RE-USING WATER\r\n\r\nWhere water is scarce it may be necessary to use it repeatedly. In a\r\ncase of this kind in Egypt, the Arab miners have adopted an ingenious\r\nmethod which may be adapted to almost any set of conditions. At a is a\r\nsump or water-pit; b is an inclined plane on which the mineral is washed\r\nand whence the water escapes into a tank c; d is a conduit for taking\r\nthe water back to a; e is a conduit or lever pump for raising the\r\nwater. A certain amount of filtration could easily be managed during the\r\npassage from c to a.\r\n\r\nCOOLING COMPOUND FOR HEATED BEARINGS\r\n\r\nMercurial ointment mixed with black cylinder oil and applied every\r\nquarter of an hour, or as often as expedient. The following is also\r\nrecommended as a good cooling compound for heavy bearings:--Tallow 2\r\nlb., plumbage 6 oz., sugar of lead 4 oz. Melt the tallow with gentle\r\nheat and add the other ingredients, stirring until cold.\r\n\r\nCLEANING GREASY PLUMMER BLOCKS\r\n\r\nWhen, through carelessness or unpreventable cause, plummer blocks\r\nand other detachable portions of machinery become clogged with sticky\r\ndeposits of grease and impurities, a simple mode of cleansing the same\r\nis to take about 1000 parts by weight of boiling water, to which add\r\nabout 10 or 15 parts of ordinary washing soda. Keep the water on the\r\nboil and place therein the portions of the machine that are to be\r\ncleaned; this treatment has the effect of quickly loosening all grease,\r\noil, and dirt, after which the metal is thoroughly washed and dried. The\r\naction of the lye is to form with the grease a soap soluble in water. To\r\nprevent lubricating oil hardening upon the parts of the machinery when\r\nin use, add a third part of kerosene.\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT ANTI-FRICTION COMPOUND\r\n\r\nFor use on cams and stamper shanks, which will be harmless should it\r\ndrop into the mortar or stamper boxes, is graphite (black-lead) and\r\nsoft soap. When the guides are wooden, the soft soap need not be added;\r\nblack-lead made into a paste with water will act admirably.\r\n\r\nTO CLEAN BRASS\r\n\r\nOxalic acid 1 oz., rotten stone 6 oz., powdered gum arabic 1/2 oz.,\r\nsweet oil 1 oz. Rub on with a piece of rag.\r\n\r\nA SOLVENT FOR RUST\r\n\r\nIt is often very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to remove rust\r\nfrom articles made of iron. Those which are very thickly coated are\r\nmost easily cleaned by being immersed in a nearly saturated solution\r\nof chloride of tin. The length of time they remain in this bath is\r\ndetermined by the thickness of the coating of rust. Generally from\r\ntwelve to twenty-four hours is long enough.\r\n\r\nTO PROTECT IRON AND STEEL FROM RUST\r\n\r\nThe following method is but little known, although it deserves\r\npreference over many others. Add 7 oz. of quicklime to 1 3/4 pints\r\nof cold water. Let the mixture stand until the supernatant fluid is\r\nentirely clear. Then pour this off, and mix with it enough olive oil\r\nto form a thick cream, or rather to the consistency of melted and\r\nre-congealed butter. Grease the articles of iron or steel with this\r\ncompound, and then wrap them up in paper, or if this cannot be done,\r\napply the mixture somewhat more thickly.\r\n\r\nTO KEEP MACHINERY FROM RUSTING\r\n\r\nTake 1 oz. of camphor, dissolve it in 1 lb. of melted lard; mix with\r\nit (after removing the scum) as much fine black-lead as will give it an\r\niron colour; clean the machinery, and smear it with this mixture. After\r\ntwenty-four hours rub off and clean with soft, linen cloth. This mixture\r\nwill keep machinery clean for months under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nFIRE-LUTE\r\n\r\nAn excellent fire-lute is made of eight parts sharp sand, two parts good\r\nclay, and one part horse-dung; mix and temper like mortar.\r\n\r\nROPE-SPLICING\r\n\r\nA short splice is made by unlaying the ends of two pieces of rope to a\r\nsufficient length, then interlaying them, draw them close and push the\r\nstrands of one under the strands of the other several times. This\r\nsplice makes a thick lump on the rope and is only used for slings,\r\nblock-straps, cables, etc.",
