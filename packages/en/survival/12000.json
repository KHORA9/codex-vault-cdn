Anthony Cruickshank--The Greatest Herd of Shorthorns\r\nin the World--Return to London and Termination of my Tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting this volume to the public, I feel that a few words of\r\nexplanation are due to the readers that it may obtain, in addition\r\nto those offered to them in the first chapter.  When I first visited\r\nEngland, in 1846, it was my intention to make a pedestrian tour from\r\none end of the island to the other, in order to become more\r\nacquainted with the country and people than I could by any other\r\nmode of travelling.  A few weeks after my arrival, I set out on such\r\na walk, and had made about one hundred miles on foot, when I was\r\nconstrained to suspend the tour, in order to take part in movements\r\nwhich soon absorbed all my time and strength.  For the ensuing ten\r\nyears I was nearly the whole time in Great Britain, travelling from\r\none end of the kingdom to the other, to promote the movements\r\nreferred to; still desiring to accomplish the walk originally\r\nproposed.  On returning to England at the beginning of 1863, after a\r\ncontinuous residence of seven years in America, I found myself, for\r\nthe first time, in the condition to carry out my intention of 1846.\r\nSeveral new motives had been added in the interval to those that had\r\nat first operated upon my mind.  I had dabbled a little in farming\r\nin my native village, New Britain, Connecticut, and had labored to\r\nexcite additional interest in agriculture among my neighbors.  We\r\nhad formed an Agricultural Club, and met weekly for several winters\r\nto compare notes, exchange opinions' and discuss matters connected\r\nwith the occupation.  They had honored me with the post of\r\nCorresponding Secretary from the beginning.  We held a meeting the\r\nevening before I left for England, when they not only refused to\r\naccept my resignation as Secretary, but made me promise to write\r\nthem letters about farming in the Mother Country, and on other\r\nmatters of interest that I might meet with on my travels there.  My\r\nfirst idea was to do this literally;--to make a walk through the\r\nbest agricultural sections of England, and write home a series of\r\ncommunications to be inserted in our little village paper.  But, on\r\nsecond thought, on considering the size of the sheet, I found it\r\nwould require four or five years to print in it all I was likely to\r\nwrite, at the rate of two columns a week.  So I concluded that the\r\neasiest and quickest way would be to make a book of my Notes by the\r\nWay, and to send back to my old friends and neighbors in that form\r\nall the observations and incidents I might make and meet on my walk.\r\nThe next thought that suggested itself was this,--that a good many\r\npersons in Great Britain might feel some interest in seeing what an\r\nAmerican, who had resided so long in this country, might have to say\r\nof its sceneries, industries, social life, etc.  Still, in writing\r\nout these Notes, although two distinct circles of readers--the\r\nEnglish and American--have been present to my mind, I felt\r\nconstrained to face and address the latter, just as if speaking to\r\nthem alone.  I have, moreover, adopted the free and easy style of\r\nepistolary composition, endeavoring to make each chapter as much\r\nlike one of the letters I promised my friends and neighbors at home\r\nas practicable.  In doing this, the \"_I_\" has, perhaps, talked far\r\ntoo much to beseem those proprieties which the author of a book\r\nshould observe.  Besides, expressions, figures and orthography more\r\nAmerican than English may be noticed, which will indicate the circle\r\nof readers which the writer had primarily in view.  Still, he would\r\nfain believe that these features of the volume will not seriously\r\naffect the interest it might otherwise possess in the minds of those\r\ndisposed to give it a reading in this country.  Whatever exceptions\r\nthey may take to the style and diction, I hope they will find none\r\nto the spirit of the work.\r\n                                           ELIHU BURRITT.\r\n\r\nLondon, April 5th, 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTIVES TO THE WALK--THE IRON HORSE AND HIS RIDER--THE LOSSES AND\r\nGAINS BY SPEED--THE RAILWAY TRACK AND TURNPIKE ROAD:  THEIR\r\nSCENERIES COMPARED.\r\n\r\nOne of my motives for making this tour was to look at the country\r\ntowns and villages on the way in the face and eyes; to enter them by\r\nthe front door, and to see them as they were made to be seen first,\r\nas far as man's mind and hand intended and wrought.  Railway\r\ntravelling, as yet, takes everything at a disadvantage; it does not\r\nfront on nature, or art, or the common conditions and industries of\r\nmen in town or country.  If it does not actually of itself turn, it\r\npresents everything the wrong side outward.  In cities, it reveals\r\nthe ragged and smutty companionship of tumble-down out-houses, and\r\nmysteries of cellar and back-kitchen life which were never intended\r\nfor other eyes than those that grope in them by day or night.  How\r\nunnatural, and, more, almost profane and inhuman, is the fiery\r\nlocomotion of the Iron Horse through these densely-peopled towns!\r\nnow the screech, the roar, and the darkness of cavernous passages\r\nunder paved streets, church vaults, and an acre or two of three-\r\nstory brick houses, with the feeling of a world of breathing,\r\nbustling humanity incumbent upon you;--now the dash and flash out\r\ninto the light, and the higgledy-piggledy glimpses of the next five\r\nminutes.  In a moment you are above thickly-thronged streets, and\r\nthe houses on either side, looking down into the black throats of\r\nsmoky chimneys; into the garret lairs of poverty, sickness, and sin;\r\ndown lower upon squads of children trying to play in back-yards\r\neight feet square.  It is all wrong, except in the single quality of\r\nspeed.  You enter the town as you would a farmer's house, if you\r\nfirst passed through the pig-stye into the kitchen.  Every\r\nrespectable house in the city turns its back upon you; and often a\r\nvery brick and dirty back too, though it may show an elegant front\r\nof Bath or Portland stone to the street it faces.  All the\r\nrespectable streets run over or under you with an audible shudder of\r\ndisgust or dread.  None but a shabby lane of low shops for the sale\r\nof junk, beer, onions, shrimps, and cabbages, will run a third of a\r\nmile by your side for the sake of your company.  The wickedest boys\r\nin the town hoot at you, with most ignominious and satiric antics,\r\nas you pass; and if they do not shie stones in upon you, or dead\r\ncats, it is more from fear of the beadle or the constable than out\r\nof respect for your business or pleasure.\r\n\r\nIndeed, every town and village, great or small, which you pass\r\nthrough or near on the railway, looks as if you came fifty years\r\nbefore you were expected.  It says, in all the legible expressions\r\nof its countenance, \"Lack-a-day!--if here isn't that creature come\r\nalready, and looking in at my back door before I had time to turn\r\naround, or put anything in shape!\"  The Iron Horse himself gets no\r\nsympathy nor humane admiration.  He stands grim and wrathy, when\r\nreined up for two minutes and forty-five seconds at a station.  No\r\nventuresome boys pat him on the flanks, or look kindly into his\r\neyes, or say a pleasant word to him, or even wonder if he is tired,\r\nor thirsty, or hungry.  None of the ostlers of the greasy stables,\r\nin which the locomotives are housed, ever call him Dobbin, or Old\r\nJack, or Jenny, or say, \"Well done, old fellow!\" when they unhitch\r\nhim from the train at midnight, after a journey of a hundred\r\nleagues.  His driver is a real man of flesh and blood; with wife and\r\nchildren whom he loves.  He goes on Sunday to church, and, maybe,\r\nsings the psalms of David, and listens devoutly to the sermon, and\r\nsays prayers at home, and the few who know him speak well of him, as\r\na good and proper man in his way.  But, spurred and mounted upon the\r\nsaddle of the great iron hexiped, nearly all the passengers regard\r\nhim as a part of the beast.  No one speaks to him, or thinks of him\r\non the journey.  He may pull up at fifty stations, and not a soul\r\namong the Firsts, Seconds, or even Thirds, will offer him a glass of\r\nbeer, or pipe-full of tobacco, or give him a sixpence at the end of\r\nthe ride for extra speed or care.  His face is grimy, and greasy,\r\nand black.  All his motions are ambiguous and awkward to the casual\r\nobserver.  He has none of the sedate and conscious dignity of his\r\npredecessor on the old stage-coach box.  He handles no whip, like\r\nhim, with easy grace.  Indeed, in putting up his great beast to its\r\nbest speed, he \"hides his whip in the manger,\" according to a\r\nproverb older than steam power.  He wears no gloves in the coldest\r\nweather; not always a coat, and never a decent one, at his work.  He\r\nblows no cheery music out of a brass bugle as he approaches a town,\r\nbut pricks the loins of the fiery beast, and makes him scream with a\r\nsound between a human whistle and an alligator's croak.  He never\r\npulls up abreast of the station-house door, in the fashion of the\r\nold coach driver, to show off himself and his leaders, but runs on\r\nseveral rods ahead of his passengers and spectators, as if to be\r\nclear of them and their comments, good or bad.  At the end of the\r\njourney, be it at midnight or day-break, not a man nor a woman he\r\nhas driven safely at the rate of forty miles an hour thinks or cares\r\nwhat becomes of him, or separates him in thought from the great iron\r\nmonster he mounts.  Not the smock-frocked man, getting out of the\r\nforwardmost Third, with his stick and bundle, thinks of him, or\r\nstops a moment to see him back out and turn into the stable.\r\n\r\nWith all the practical advantages of this machine propulsion at bird\r\nspeed over space, it confounds and swallows up the poetical aspects\r\nand picturesque sceneries that were the charm of old-fashioned\r\ntravelling in the country.  The most beautiful landscapes rotate\r\naround a locomotive axis confusedly.  Green pastures and yellow\r\nwheat fields are in a whirl.  Tall and venerable trees get into the\r\nwake of the same motion, and the large, pied cows ruminating in\r\ntheir shade, seem to lie on the revolving arc of an indefinite\r\ncircle.  The views dissolve before their best aspect is caught by\r\nthe eye.  The flowers, like Eastern beauties, can only be seen \"half\r\nhidden and half revealed,\" in the general unsteadiness.  As for\r\nbees, you cannot hear or see them at all; and the songs of the\r\nhappiest birds are drowned altogether by the clatter of a hundred\r\nwheels on the metal track.  If there are any poor, flat, or fen\r\nlands, your way is sure to lie through them.  In a picturesque and\r\nundulating country, studded with parks and mansions of wealth and\r\ntaste, you are plunging through a long, dark tunnel, or walled into\r\na deep cut, before your eye can catch the view that dashes by your\r\ncarriage window.  If you have a utilitarian proclivity and purpose,\r\nand would like to see the great agricultural industries of the\r\ncountry, they present themselves to you in as confused aspects as\r\nthe sceneries of the passing landscape.  The face of every farm is\r\nturned from you.  The farmer's house fronts on the turnpike road,\r\nand the best views of his homestead, of his industry, prosperity,\r\nand happiness, look that way.  You only get a furtive glance, a kind\r\nof clandestine and diagonal peep at him and his doings; and having\r\nthus travelled a hundred miles through a fertile country you can\r\nform no approximate or satisfactory idea of its character and\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nBut no facts nor arguments are needed to convince an intelligent\r\ntraveller that the railway affords no point of view for seeing town\r\nor country to any satisfactory perception of its character.  Indeed,\r\nneither coach of the olden, nor cab of the modern vogue, nor saddle,\r\nwill enable one to \"do\" either town or country with thorough insight\r\nand enjoyment.  It takes him too long to pull up to catch the\r\nfeatures of a sudden view.  He can do nothing with those generous\r\nand delightful institutions of Old England,--the footpaths, that\r\nthread pasture, park, and field, seemingly permeating her whole\r\ngreen world with dusky veins for the circulation of human life.  To\r\nlose all the picturesque lanes and landscapes which these field-\r\npaths cross and command, is to lose the great distinctive charm of\r\nthe country.  Then, neither from the coach-box nor the saddle can he\r\nmake much conversation on the way.  He loses the chance of a\r\nthousand little talks and pleasant incidents.  He cannot say \"Good\r\nmorning\" to the farmer at the stile, nor a word of greeting to the\r\nreapers over the hedge, nor see where they live, and the kind of\r\nchildren that play by their cottage doors; nor the little, antique\r\nchurches, bearded to their eye-brows with ivy, covering the wrinkles\r\nof half a dozen centuries, nor the low and quiet villages clustering\r\naround, each like a family of bushy-headed children surrounding\r\ntheir venerable mother.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these considerations, there was another that moved me\r\nto this walk.  Although I had been up and down the country as often\r\nand as extensively as any American, perhaps, and admired its general\r\nscenery, I had never looked at it with an agricultural eye or\r\ninterest.  But, having dabbled a little in farming in the interval\r\nbetween my last two visits to England, and being touched with some\r\nof the enthusiasm that modern novices carry into the occupation, I\r\nwas determined to look at the agriculture of Great Britain more\r\nleisurely and attentively, and from a better stand-point than I had\r\never done before.  The thought had also occurred to me, that a walk\r\nthrough the best agricultural counties of England and Scotland would\r\nafford opportunity for observation which might be made of some\r\ninterest to my friends and neighbor farmers in America as well as to\r\nmyself.  Therefore I beg the English reader to remember that I am\r\naddressing to them the notes that I may make by the way, hoping that\r\nits incidents and the thoughts it suggests will not be devoid of\r\ninterest because they are principally intended for the American ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST DAY'S OBSERVATIONS AND ENJOYMENT--RURAL FOOT-PATHS; VISIT TO\r\nTIPTREE FARM--ALDERMAN MECHI'S OPERATIONS--IMPROVEMENTS INTRODUCED,\r\nDECRIED, AND ADOPTED--STEAM POWER, UNDER-DRAINING, DEEP TILLAGE,\r\nIRRIGATION--PRACTICAL RESULTS.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, July 15th, 1863, I left London with the hope that I\r\nmight be able to accomplish the northern half of my proposed \"Walk\r\nfrom Land's End to John O'Groat's.\"  I had been practically\r\nprostrated by a serious indisposition for nearly two months, and was\r\njust able to walk one or two miles at a time about the city.\r\nBelieving that country air and exercise would soon enable me to be\r\nlonger on my feet, I concluded to set out as I was, without waiting\r\nfor additional strength, so slow and difficult to attain in the\r\nsmoky atmosphere and hot streets of London.\r\n\r\nFew reading farmers in America there are who are not familiar with\r\nthe name and fame of Alderman Mechi, as an agriculturist of that new\r\nand scientific school that is making such a revolution in the great\r\nprimeval industry of mankind.  His experiments on his Tiptree Farm\r\nhave attained a world-wide publicity, and have given that homestead\r\nan interest that, perhaps, never attached to the same number of\r\nacres in any country or age.  Thinking that this famous\r\nestablishment would be a good starting point for my pedestrian tour,\r\nI concluded to proceed thither first by railway, and thence to walk\r\nnorthward, by easy stages, through the fertile and rural county of\r\nEssex.  Taking an afternoon train, I reached Kelvedon about 5 p.m.,-\r\n-the station for Tiptree, and a good specimen of an English village,\r\nat two hours' ride from London.  Calling at the residence of a\r\nFriend, or Quaker, to inquire the way to the Alderman's farm, he\r\ninvited me to take tea with him, and be his guest for the night,--a\r\nhospitality which I very gladly accepted, as it was a longer walk\r\nthan I had anticipated.  After tea, my host, who was a farmer as\r\nwell as miller, took me over his fields, and showed me his live\r\nstock, his crops of wheat, barley, oats, beans, and roots, which\r\nwere all large and luxuriant, and looked a tableau vivant of plenty\r\nwithin the green hedges that enclosed and adorned them.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after breakfast, my kind host set me on the way to\r\nTiptree by a footpath through alternating fields of wheat, barley,\r\noats, beans, and turnips, into which an English farm is generally\r\ndivided.  These footpaths are among the vested interests of the\r\nwalking public throughout the United Kingdom.  Most of them are\r\ncenturies old.  The footsteps of a dozen generations have given them\r\nthe force and sanctity of a popular right.  A farmer might as well\r\nundertake to barricade the turnpike road as to close one of these\r\nold paths across his best fields.  So far from obstructing them, he\r\nfinds it good policy to straighten and round them up, and supply\r\nthem with convenient gates or stiles, so that no one shall have an\r\nexcuse for trampling on his crops, or for diverging into the open\r\nfield for a shorter cut to the main road.  Blessings on the man who\r\ninvented them!  It was done when land was cheap, and public roads\r\nwere few; before four wheels were first geared together for business\r\nor pleasure.  They were the doing of another age; this would not\r\nhave produced them.  They run through all the prose, poetry, and\r\nromance of the rural life of England, permeating the history of\r\ngreen hedges, thatched cottages, morning songs of the lark,\r\nmoonlight walks, meetings at the stile, harvest homes of long ago,\r\nand many a romantic narrative of human experience widely read in\r\nboth hemispheres.  They will run on for ever, carrying with them the\r\nsame associations.  They are the inheritance of landless millions,\r\nwho have trodden them in ages past at dawn, noon, and night, to and\r\nfrom their labor; and in ages to come the mowers and reapers shall\r\ntread them to the morning music of the lark, and through Spring,\r\nSummer, Autumn, and Winter, they shall show the fresh checker-work\r\nof the ploughman's hob-nailed shoe.  The surreptitious innovations\r\nof utilitarian science shall not poach upon these sacred preserves\r\nof the people, whatever revolutions they may produce in the\r\nmachinery and speed of turnpike locomotion.  These pleasant and\r\npeaceful paths through park, and pasture, meandering through the\r\nbeautiful and sweet-breathing artistry of English agriculture, are\r\nguaranteed to future generations by an authority which no\r\nlegislation can annul.\r\n\r\nA walk of a few miles brought me in sight of Tiptree Hall; and its\r\nfirst aspect relieved my mind of an impression which, in common with\r\nthousands better informed, I had entertained in reference to the\r\nestablishment.  An idea has generally prevailed among English\r\nfarmers, and agriculturists of other countries who have heard of\r\nAlderman Mechi's experiments, that they were impracticable and\r\nalmost valueless, because they would not _pay_; that the balance-\r\nsheet of his operations did and must ever show such ruinous\r\ndiscrepancy between income and expenditure as must deter any man, of\r\nless capital and reckless enthusiasm, from following his lead into\r\nsuch unconsidered ventures.  In short, he has been widely regarded\r\nat home and abroad as a bold and dashing novice in agricultural\r\nexperience, ready to lavish upon his own hasty inventions a fortune\r\nacquired in his London warehouse; and all this to make himself\r\nfamous as a great light in the agricultural world, which light,\r\nafter all, was a mere will-o'-the-wisp sort of affair, leading its\r\ndupes into the veriest bog of bankruptcy.  In common with all those\r\nbold, self-reliant spirits that have ventured to break away from the\r\nantecedents of public opinion and custom, he has been the subject of\r\nmany ungenerous innuendoes and criticisms.  All kinds of ambitions\r\nand motives have been ascribed to him.  Many a burly, red-faced\r\nfarmer, who boasts of an unbroken agricultural lineage reaching back\r\ninto the reign of Good Queen Bess, will tell you over his beer that\r\nthe Alderman's doings are all _gammon_; that they are all to\r\nadvertise his cutlery business in Leadenhall Street, Barnum fashion;\r\nto inveigle down to Tiptree Hall noblemen, foreign ambassadors, and\r\ngreat people of different countries, and bribe \"an honourable\r\nmention\" out of them with champagne treats and oyster suppers.\r\nIndeed, my Quaker host largely participated in this opinion, and\r\ntook no pains to conceal it when speaking of his enterprising\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\nFrom what I had read and heard of the Tiptree Hall estate, I\r\nexpected to see a grand, old, baronial mansion, surrounded with\r\nelegant and costly buildings for housing horses, cattle, sheep, and\r\nother live stock, all erected on a scale which no bona fide farmer\r\ncould adopt or approximately imitate.  In a word, I fancied his\r\nbarns and stables would even surpass in this respect the\r\nestablishments of some of those most wealthy New York or Boston\r\nmerchants, who think they are stimulating country farmers to healthy\r\nemulation by lavishing from thirty to forty thousand dollars on a\r\nbarn and its appurtenant out-houses.  With these preconceived ideas,\r\nit was an unexpected satisfaction to see quite a simple-looking,\r\nunassuming establishment, which any well-to-do farmer might make and\r\nown.  The house is rather a large and solid-looking building,\r\nerected by Mr. Mechi himself, but not at all ostentatious of wealth\r\nor architectural taste.  The barns and \"steddings,\" or what we call\r\ncowhouses in America, are of a very ordinary cast, or such as any\r\ncountry-bred farmer would call economical and simple.  The homestead\r\noccupies no picturesque site, and commands no interesting scenery.\r\nThe farm consists of about 170 acres, which, in England, is regarded\r\nas a rather small holding.  The land is naturally sterile and hard\r\nof cultivation, most of it apparently being heavily mixed with\r\nferruginous matter.  When ploughed deeply, the clods turned up look\r\nfrequently like compact masses of iron ore.  Every experienced\r\nfarmer knows the natural poverty of such a soil, and the hard labor\r\nto man and beast it costs to till it.\r\n\r\nTo my great regret, Mr. Mechi was not at home, though he passes most\r\nof his time in Summer at Tiptree.  But his foreman, who enters into\r\nall the experiments and operations which have made the establishment\r\nso famous, with almost equal interest and enthusiasm, took me\r\nthrough the farm buildings, and all the fields, and showed me the\r\nwhole process and machinery employed.  Any English or American\r\nagriculturist who has read of Alderman Mechi's operations, would be\r\ninclined to ask, on looking, for the first time, at his buildings\r\nand the fields surrounding them, what is the great distinguishing\r\nspeciality of his enterprise.  His land is poor; his housings are\r\nsimple; there is no outside show of uncommon taste or genius.  Every\r\nacre is tile-drained, to be sure.  But that is nothing new nor\r\nuncommon.  Drainage is the order of the day.  Any tenant farmer in\r\nEngland can have his land drained by the Government by paying six\r\nper cent. annually on the cost of the job.  His expenditure for\r\nartificial manure does not exceed that of hundreds of good farmers.\r\nHe carries out the deep tillage system most liberally.  So do other\r\nscientific agriculturalists in Europe and America.  Of course, a few\r\nhours' observation would not suffice for a full and correct\r\nconclusion on this point, but it gave me the impression that the\r\ngreat operation which has won for the Tiptree Farm its special\r\ndistinction is its irrigation with liquid manure.  In this respect\r\nit stands unrivalled, and, perhaps, unimitated.  And this, probably,\r\nis the head and front of his offending to those who criticise his\r\neconomy and decry his experiments.\r\n\r\nThis irrigation is performed through the medium of a small steam\r\nengine and sixteen hydrants, so posted and supplied with hose as to\r\nreach every square foot of the 170 acres.  The water used for this\r\npurpose is mostly, if not entirely, supplied from the draining\r\npipes, even in the dryest season.  The manure thus liquified is made\r\nby a comparatively small number of animals.  Calves to the value of\r\n50 pounds are bought, and fat stock to that of 500 pounds are sold\r\nannually.  They are all stabled throughout the year, except in\r\nharvest time, when they are turned out for a few weeks to rowen\r\nfeed.  The calves are housed until a year old in a large stedding by\r\nthemselves.  They are then transferred to another building, and put\r\nupon \"the boards;\" that is in a long stable or cowhouse, with a\r\nflooring of slats, through which the manure drops into a cellar\r\nbelow, made water-tight.  Here the busiest little engine in the\r\nworld is brought to bear upon it, with all its faculties of suction\r\nand propulsion.  Through one pipe it forces fresh water in upon this\r\nmass of manure, which, when liquified, runs down into a subterranean\r\ncistern or reservoir capable of holding over 100,000 gallons.  From\r\nthis it is propelled into any field to be irrigated.  To prevent any\r\nsediment in the great reservoir, or to make an even mixture of the\r\nliquified manure, a hose is attached to the engine, and the other\r\nend dropped into the mass.  Through this a constant volume of air is\r\npropelled with such force as to set the whole boiling and foaming\r\nlike a little cataract.  One man at the engine and two at the hose\r\nin the distant field perform the whole operation.  The chapped and\r\n\"baky\" surface of the farm is thus softened and enriched at will,\r\nand rendered productive.\r\n\r\nNow, this operation seems to constitute the present distinctive\r\nspeciality of Alderman Mechi's Tiptree Farm.  Will it pay? ask a\r\nthousand voices.  In how many years will he get his money back?\r\nGive us the balance sheet of the experiment.  A New Englander,\r\nfavorably impressed with the process, would be likely to answer\r\nthese questions by another, and ask, will _drainage_ pay?  Not in\r\none year, assuredly, nor in five; not in ten, perhaps.  The British\r\nGovernment assumes that all the expenditure upon under-drainage will\r\nbe paid back in fifteen or twenty years at the farthest.  It lends\r\nmoney to the land-owner on this basis; and the land-owner stipulates\r\nwith his tenant that he shall reimburse him by annual instalments of\r\nsix or seven per cent. until the whole cost of the operation is\r\nliquidated.  Thus the tenant-farmer is willing to pay six, sometimes\r\nseven per cent. annually, for twenty years, for the increased\r\ncapacity of production which drainage gives to the farm he\r\ncultivates.  At the end of that period the Government is paid by the\r\nlandlord, and the landlord by the tenant, and the tenant by his\r\naugmented crops for the whole original outlay upon the land.  For\r\naught either of the three parties to the operation knows to the\r\ncontrary, it must all be done over again at the end of twenty years.\r\nThe system is too young yet, even in England, for any one to say how\r\nlong a course of tubing will last, or how often it must be relaid.\r\n\r\nOne point, therefore, has been gained.  No intelligent English\r\nfarmer, who has tried the system, now asks if under-drainage will\r\npay; nor does he expect that it will pay back the whole expenditure\r\nin less than twelve or fifteen years.  Here is a generous faith in\r\nthe operation on the side of all the parties concerned.  Then why\r\nshould not Alderman Mechi's irrigation system be put on the same\r\nfooting, in the matter of public confidence?  It is nothing very\r\nuncommon even for a two-hundred-acre farmer in England to have a\r\nsmall stationary or locomotive steam-engine, and to find plenty of\r\nwork for it, too, in threshing his grain, grinding his fodder,\r\npulping his roots, cutting his hay and straw, and for other\r\npurposes.  Mr. Mechi would doubtless have one for these objects\r\nalone.  So its cost must not be charged to the account of\r\nirrigation.  A single course of iron tubing, a third of a mile long,\r\nreaching to the centre of his farthest field, cannot cost more, with\r\nall the hose employed, than the drainage of that field, while it\r\nwould be fair to assume that the iron pipes will last twice as long\r\nas those of burnt clay.  They might fairly be expected to hold good\r\nfor forty years.  If, then, for this period, or less, the process\r\nyields ten per cent. of increased production annually, over and\r\nabove the effect of all other means employed, it is quite evident\r\nthat it will pay as well as drainage.\r\n\r\nBut does it augment the yearly production of the farm by this\r\namount?  To say that it is the only process by which the baky and\r\nchappy soil of Tiptree can be thoroughly fertilised, would not\r\nsuffice to prove its necessity or value to other soils of different\r\ncomposition.  One fact, however, may be sufficient to determine its\r\nvirtue.  The fields of clover, and Italian rye-grass, etc., are mown\r\nthree and even four times in one season, and afterwards fed with\r\nsheep.  Certainly, no other system could produce all this cropping.\r\nThe distinctive difference it makes in other crops cannot, perhaps,\r\nbe made so palpable.  The wheat looked strong and heavy, with a fair\r\npromise of forty-five bushels to an acre.  The oats, beans, and\r\nroots showed equally well.\r\n\r\nThe irrigation and deep tillage systems were going on simultaneously\r\nin the same field, affording me a good opportunity of seeing the\r\noperation of both.  Two men were plying the hose upon a portion of\r\nthe field which had already been mowed three times.  Two teams were\r\nat work turning up the other, which had already been cropped once or\r\ntwice.  One of two horses went first, and, with a common English\r\nplough, turned an ordinary furrow.  Then the other followed, of\r\ntwice the force of the first, in the same furrow, with a subsoil\r\nplough held to the work beam-deep.  The iron-stones and ferruginous\r\nclods turned up by this \"deep tillage\" would make a prairie farmer\r\nof Illinois wonder, if not shudder, at the plucky and ingenious\r\nindustry which competes with his easy toil and cheap land in\r\nproviding bread for the landless millions of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe only exceptional feature or arrangement, besides the irrigating\r\nmachinery and process, that I noticed, was an iron hurdling for\r\nfolding sheep.  This, at first sight, might look to a practical\r\nfarmer a little extravagant, indicating a city origin, or the notion\r\nof an amateur agriculturist, more ambitious of the new than of the\r\nnecessary.  Each length of this iron fencing is apparently about a\r\nrod, and cost 1 pound, or nearly five dollars.  It is fitted to low\r\nwheels, or rollers, on an axle two or three feet in length, so that\r\nit can be moved easily and quickly in any direction.  It would cost\r\nover fifty pounds, or two hundred and fifty dollars, to enclose an\r\nacre entirely with this kind of hurdling.  Still, Mr. Mechi would\r\ndoubtless be able to show that this large expenditure is a good\r\ninvestment, and pays well in the long run.  The folding of sheep for\r\ntwenty-four or forty-eight hours on small patches of clover,\r\ntrefoil, or turnips, is a very important department of English\r\nfarming, both for fattening them for the market and for putting the\r\nland in better heart than any other fertilising process could\r\neffect.  Now, a man with this iron fencing on wheels must be able to\r\nmake in two hours an enclosure that would cost him a day or more of\r\nbusy labor with the old wooden hurdles.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, a practical farmer, who has no other source of income\r\nthan the single occupation of agriculture, would be likely to ask,\r\nwhat is the realised value of Alderman Mechi's operations to the\r\ncommon grain and stock-growers of the world?  They have excited more\r\nattention or curiosity than any other experiments of the present\r\nday; but what is the real resume of their results?  What new\r\nprinciples has he laid down; what new economy has he reduced to a\r\nscience that may be profitably utilised by the million who get their\r\nliving by farming?  What has he actually done that anybody else has\r\nadopted or imitated to any tangible advantage?  These are important\r\nquestions; and this is the way he undertakes to answer them,\r\nbeginning with the last.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago, he inaugurated the system of under-draining\r\nthe heavy tile-clay lands in Essex.  Up to his experiment, the\r\nprocess was deemed impracticable and worthless by the most\r\nintelligent farmers of the county.  It was more confidently decried\r\nthan his present irrigation system.  The water would never find its\r\nway down into the drain-pipes through such clay.  It stood to reason\r\nthat it would do no such thing.  Did not the water stand in the\r\ntrack of the horse's hoof in such rich clay until evaporated by the\r\nsun?  It might as well leak through an earthenware basin.  It was\r\nall nonsense to bury a man's money in that style.  He never would\r\nsee a shilling of it back again.  In the face of these opinions, Mr.\r\nMechi went on, training his pipes through field after field, deep\r\nbelow the surface.  And the water percolated through the clay into\r\nthem, until all these long veins formed a continuous and rushing\r\nstream into the main artery that now furnishes an ample supply for\r\nhis stabled cattle, for his steam engine, and for all the barn-yard\r\nwants.  His tile-draining of clay-lands was a capital success; and\r\nthose who derided and opposed it have now adopted it to their great\r\nadvantage, and to the vast augmentation of the value and production\r\nof the county.  Here, then, is one thing in which he has led, and\r\nothers have followed to a great practical result.\r\n\r\nHis next leading was in the way of agricultural machinery.  He first\r\nintroduced a steam engine for farming purposes in a district\r\ncontaining a million of acres.  That, too, at the outset, was a\r\nfantastic vagary in the opinion of thousands of solid and\r\nrespectable farmers.  They insisted the Iron Horse would be as\r\ndangerous in the barn-yard or rick-yard as the very dragon in\r\nScripture; that he would set everything on fire; kill the men who\r\nhad care of him; burst and blow up himself and all the buildings\r\ninto the air; that all the horses, cows, and sheep would be\r\nfrightened to death at the very sight of the monster, and never\r\ncould be brought to lie down in peace and safety by his side, even\r\nwhen his blood was cold, and when he was fast asleep.  To think of\r\nit! to have a tall chimney towering up over a barn-gable or barn-\r\nyard, and puffing out black coal smoke, cotton-factory-wise!  Pretty\r\ntalk! pretty terms to train an honest and virtuous farmer to mouth!\r\nWouldn't it be edifying to hear him string the yarn of these new\r\nwords! to hear him tell of his _engineer_ and ploughman; of his\r\n_pokers_ and pitchforks; of _six-horse power, valves, revolutions,\r\nstopcocks, twenty pounds of steam_, etc.; mixing up all this\r\nridiculous stuff with yearling-calves, turnips, horse-carts, oil-\r\ncake, wool, bullocks, beans, and sheep, and other vital things and\r\ninterests, which forty centuries have looked upon with reverence!\r\nTo plough, thresh, cut turnips, grind corn, and pump water for\r\ncattle by steam!  What next?\r\n\r\nWhy, next, the farmers of the region round about\r\n\r\n     \"First pitied, then embraced\"\r\n\r\nthis new and powerful auxiliary to agricultural industry, after\r\nhaving watched its working and its worth.  And now, thanks to such\r\nbold and spirited novices as Mr. Mechi--men who had the pluck to\r\nwork steadily on under the pattering rain of derisive epithets--\r\nthere are already nearly as many steam engines working at farm labor\r\nbetween Land's End and John O'Groat's as there are employed in the\r\nmanufacture of cotton in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nHis irrigation system will doubtless be followed in the same order\r\nand interval by those who have pooh-poohed it with the same derision\r\nand incredulity as the other innovations they have already adopted.\r\nThe utilising of the sewage of large towns, especially of London,\r\nhas now become a prominent idea and movement.  Mr. Mechi's machinery\r\nand process are admirably adapted to the work of distributing a\r\nriver of this fertilising material over any farm to which it may be\r\nconducted.  Thus, there is good reason to believe that the very\r\nprocess he originated for softening and enriching the hard and\r\nsterile acres of his small farm in Essex will be adopted for\r\nsaturating millions of acres in Great Britain with the millions of\r\ntons of manurial matter that have hitherto blackened and poisoned\r\nthe rivers of the country on their wasteful way to the sea.  This\r\nwill be only an additional work for the farm engines now in\r\noperation, accomplished with but little increased expense.  A single\r\nfact may illustrate the irrigating capacity of Mr. Mechi's\r\nmachinery.  It throws upon a field a quantity of the fertilising\r\nfluid equal to one inch of rainfall at a time, or 100 tons per\r\nimperial acre.  And, as a proof of how deep it penetrates, the\r\ndrains run freely with it, thus showing conclusively that the\r\nsubsoil has been well saturated, a point of vital importance to the\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nDeep tillage is another speciality that distinguished the Tiptree\r\nFarm regime at the beginning, in which Mr. Mechi led, and in which\r\nhe has been followed by the farmers of the country, although few\r\nhave come up abreast of him as yet in the system.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are four specific departments of improvement in\r\nagricultural industry which the Alderman has introduced.  Every one\r\nof them has been ridiculed as an impracticable and useless\r\ninnovation in its turn.  Three of them have already been adopted,\r\nand virtually incorporated with agricultural science and economy;\r\nand the fourth, or irrigation by steam power, bids fair to find as\r\nmuch favor, and as many adherents in the end as the others have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHe has not only originated these improvements, or been the first to\r\ngive them practical experiment, but he has laid down certain\r\nprinciples which will doubtless exercise much influence in shaping\r\nthe industrial economy of agriculture hereafter in different\r\ncountries.  One of the best of these principles he puts in the form\r\nof a mathematical proposition.  Thus:--As the meat is to the manure,\r\nso is the crop to the land.  Tell me, he says, how much meat you\r\nmake, and I will tell you how much corn you make, to the acre.\r\nMeat, then, is the starting point with him; the basis of his annual\r\nproduction, to which he looks for a satisfactory decision of his\r\nbalance-sheet.  To show the value he attaches to this element, the\r\nfact will suffice that he usually keeps 65 bullocks, cows, and\r\ncalves, 100 sheep, and a number of pigs, besides his horses, making\r\none head to every acre of his farm.  With this amount of live stock\r\nhe makes from 4 to 5 pounds worth of meat per acre annually.\r\nPerhaps it would be safe to say that no other 170 acres of land in\r\nthe world make more meat, manure, and grain in the year than the\r\nTiptree Farm.  In these results Mr. Mechi thinks his experiments and\r\nimprovements have proved\r\n\r\n     Quod es demonstrandum.\r\n\r\nHaving gone over the farm pretty thoroughly, and noticed all the\r\nleading features of the establishment, I was requested by the\r\nforeman to enter my name in the visitor's book kept in his neat\r\ncottage parlor.  It is a large volume, with the ruling running\r\nacross both the wide pages; the left apportioned to name, town,\r\ncountry, and profession; the right to remarks of the visitor.  It is\r\ntruly a remarkable book of interesting autographs and observations,\r\nwhich the philologist as well as agriculturist might pore over with\r\nlively satisfaction.  It not only contains the names and comments of\r\nmany of the most distinguished personages in Great Britain, but\r\nthose of all other countries of Europe, even of Asia and Africa, as\r\nwell as America.  Foreign ambassadors, Continental savans, men of\r\nfame in the literary, scientific, and political world have here\r\nrecorded their names and impressions in the most unique succession\r\nand blending.  Here, under one date, is a party of Italian\r\ngentlemen, leaving their autographs and their observations in the\r\nsoftest syllables of their language.  Then several German\r\nconnoisseurs follow in their peculiar script, with comments worded\r\nheavily with hard-mouthed consonants.  Then comes, perhaps, a single\r\nRussian nobleman, who expresses his profound satisfaction in the\r\npolitest French.  Next succeed three or four Spanish Dons, with a\r\nlong fence of names attached to each, who give their views of the\r\nestablishment in the grave, sonorous words of their language.  Here,\r\nnow, an American puts in his autograph, with his sharp, curt notion\r\nof the matter, as \"first-rate.\"  Very likely a turbaned Mufti or\r\nSingh of the Oriental world follows the New England farmer.  Danish\r\nand Swedish knights prolong the procession, mingling with Australian\r\nwool-growers, Members of the French Royal Academy, Canadian timber-\r\nmerchants, Dutch Mynheers, Brazilian coffee-planters, Belgian lace-\r\nmakers, and the representatives of all other countries and\r\nprofessions in Christendom.  An autograph-monger, with the mania\r\nstrong upon him, of unscrupulous curiosity, armed furtively with a\r\nkeen pair of scissors would be a dangerous person to admit to the\r\npresence of that big book without a policeman at his elbow.\r\n\r\nTiptree Hall has its own literature also, in two or three volumes,\r\nwritten by Mr. Mechi himself, and describing fully his agricultural\r\nexperience and experiments, and giving facts and arguments which\r\nevery English and American farmer might study with profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH AND AMERICAN BIRDS.\r\n\r\n     \"What thou art we know not;\r\n      What is most like thee?\r\n      From rainbow clouds there flow not\r\n      Drops so bright to see,\r\n      As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.\"\r\n                                 SHELLEY'S \"SKYLARK.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Do you ne'er think what wondrous beings these?\r\n      Do you ne'er think who made them, and who taught\r\n      The dialect they speak, whose melodies\r\n      Alone are the interpreters of thought?\r\n      Whose household words are songs in many keys,\r\n      Sweeter than instrument of man e'er caught!\r\n      Whose habitations in the tree-tops, even,\r\n      Are half-way houses on the road to heaven.\"\r\n                                           LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nHaving spent a couple of hours very pleasantly at Tiptree Hall, I\r\nturned my face in a northerly direction for a walk through the best\r\nagricultural section of Essex.  While passing through a grass field\r\nrecently mown, a lark flew up from almost under my feet.  And there,\r\npartially overarched by a tuft of clover, was her little all of\r\nearth--a snug, warm nest with two small eggs in it, about the size\r\nand color of those of the ground-chirping-bird of New England, which\r\nis nearer the English lark than any other American bird.  I bent\r\ndown to look at them with an interest an American could only feel.\r\nTo him the lark is to the bird-world's companionship and music what\r\nthe angels are to the spirit land.  He has read and dreamed of both\r\nfrom his childhood up.  He has believed in both poetically and\r\npleasantly, sometimes almost positively, as real and beautiful\r\nindividualities.  He almost credits the poet of his own country, who\r\nspeaks of hearing \"the downward beat of angel wings.\"  In his facile\r\nfaith in the substance of picturesque and happy shadows, he\r\nsometimes tries to believe that the phoenix may have been, in some\r\nage and country, a real, living bird, of flesh and blood and genuine\r\nfeathers, with long, strong wings, capable of performing the strange\r\npsychological feats ascribed to it in that most edifying picture\r\nemblazoned on the arms of Banking Companies, Insurance Offices, and\r\nQuack Doctors.  He is not sure that dying swans have not sung a\r\nmournful hymn over their last moments, under an affecting and human\r\nsense of their mortality.  He has believed in the English lark to\r\nthe same point of pleasing credulity.  Why should he not give its\r\nexistence the same faith?  The history of its life is as old as the\r\nEnglish alphabet, and older still.  It sang over the dark and\r\nhideous lairs of the bloody Druids centuries before Julius Caesar\r\nwas born, and they doubtless had a pleasant name for it, unless true\r\nmusic was hateful to their ears.  It sang, without loss or change of\r\na single note of this morning's song, to the Roman legions as they\r\nmarched, or made roads in Britain.  It rang the same voluntaries to\r\nthe Saxons, Danes, and Normans, through the long ages, and, perhaps,\r\ntended to soften their antagonisms, and hasten their blending into\r\none great and mighty people.  How the name and song of this happiest\r\nof earthly birds run through all the rhyme and romance of English\r\npoetry, of English rural life, ever since there was an England!\r\nTake away its history and its song from her daisy-eyed meadows, and\r\nshaded lanes, and hedges breathing and blooming with sweetbrier\r\nleaves and hawthorn flowers--from her thatched cottages, veiled with\r\nivy--from the morning tread of the reapers, and the mower's lunch of\r\nbread and cheese under the meadow elm, and you take away a living\r\nand beautiful spirit more charming than music.  You take away from\r\nEnglish poetry one of its pleiades, and bereave it of a\r\ncompanionship more intimate than that of the nearest neighborhood of\r\nthe stars above.  How the lark's life and song blend, in the rhyme\r\nof the poet, with \"the sheen of silver fountains leaping to the\r\nsea,\" with morning sunbeams and noontide thoughts, with the sweetest\r\nbreathing flowers, and softest breezes, and busiest bees, and\r\ngreenest leaves, and happiest human industries, loves, hopes, and\r\naspirations!\r\n\r\nThe American has read and heard of all this from his youth up to the\r\nday of setting his foot, for the first time, on English ground.  He\r\nhas tried to believe it, as in things seen, temporal and tangible.\r\nBut in doing this he has to contend with a sense or suspicion of\r\nunreality--a feeling that there has been great poetical exaggeration\r\nin the matter.  A patent fact lies at the bottom of this\r\nincredulity.  The forefathers of New England carried no wild bird\r\nwith them to sing about their cabin homes in the New World.  But\r\nthey found beautiful and happy birds on that wild continent, as\r\nwell-dressed, as graceful in form and motion, and of as fine taste\r\nfor music and other accomplishments, as if they and their ancestors\r\nhad sung before the courts of Europe for twenty generations.  These\r\nsang their sweet songs of welcome to the Pilgrims as they landed\r\nfrom the \"Mayflower.\"  These sang to them cheerily, through the\r\nfirst years and the later years of their stern trials and\r\ntribulations.  These built their nests where the blue eyes of the\r\nfirst white children born in the land could peer in upon the\r\nspeckled eggs with wonder and delight.  What wonder that those\r\nstrong-hearted puritan fathers and mothers, who\r\n\r\n     \"Made the aisles of the dim wood ring\r\n      With the anthems of the free,\"\r\n\r\nshould love the fellowship of these native singers of the field and\r\nforest, and give them names their hearts loved in the old home land\r\nbeyond the sea!  They did not consult Linnaeus, nor any musty Latin\r\ngenealogy of Old World birds, at the christening of these songsters.\r\nThere was a good family resemblance in many cases.  The blustering\r\npartridge, brooding over her young in the thicket, was very nearly\r\nlike the same bird in England.  For the mellow-throated thrush of\r\nthe old land they found a mate in the new, of the same size, color,\r\nand general habits, though less musical.  The blackbird was nearly\r\nthe same in many respects, though the smaller American wore a pair\r\nof red epaulettes.  The swallows had their coat tails cut after the\r\nsame old English pattern, and built their nests after the same\r\nmodel, and twittered under the eaves with the same ecstacy, and\r\nplayed the same antics in the air.  But the two dearest home-birds\r\nof the fatherland had no family relations nor counterparts in\r\nAmerica; and the pilgrim fathers and their children could not make\r\ntheir humble homes happy without the lark and the robin, at least in\r\nname and association; so they looked about them for substitutes.\r\nThere was a plump, full-chested bird, in a chocolate-colored vest,\r\nwith a bluish dress coat, that would mount the highest tree-top in\r\nearly spring, and play his flute by the hour for very joy to see the\r\nsnow melt and the buds swell again.  There was such a rollicking\r\nhappiness in his loud, clear notes, and he apparently sang them in\r\nsuch sympathy with human fellowships, and hopes, and homes, and he\r\nwas such a cheery and confiding denizen of the orchard and garden\r\nwithal, that he became at once the pet bird of old and young, and\r\nwas called the _robin_; and well would it be if its English namesake\r\npossessed its sterling virtues; for, with all its pleasant traits\r\nand world-wide reputation, the English robin is a pretentious,\r\narrogant busybody, characteristically pugilistic and troublesome in\r\nthe winged society of England.  In form, dress, deportment,\r\ndisposition, and in voice and taste for vocal music, the American\r\nrobin surpasses the English most decidedly.  In this our grave\r\nforefathers did more than justice to the home-bird they missed on\r\nPlymouth Rock.  In this generous treatment of their affection for\r\nit, they perhaps condoned for mating the English lark so\r\nincongruously; but it was true their choice was very limited.  To\r\nmatch the prima donna carissima of English field and sky, it was\r\nnecessary to select a meadow bird, with some other features of\r\nresemblance.  It would never do to give the cherished name and\r\nassociation to one that lived in the forest, or built its nest in\r\nthe tree-tops or house-tops, or to one that was black, yellow, or\r\nred.  Having to conciliate all these conditions, and do the best\r\nwith the material at hand, they pitched upon a rather large,\r\nbrownish bird, in a drab waistcoat, slightly mottled, and with a\r\nloud, cracked voice, which nobody ever liked.  So it never became a\r\nfavorite, even to those who first gave it the name of lark.  It was\r\nnot its only defect that it lacked an ear and voice for music.\r\nThere is always a scolding accent that marks its conversation with\r\nother birds in the brightest mornings of June.  He is very noisy,\r\nbut never merry nor musical.  Indeed, compared with the notes of the\r\nEnglish lark, his are like the vehement ejaculations of a maternal\r\nduck in distress.\r\n\r\nTake it in all, no bird in either hemisphere equals the English lark\r\nin heart or voice, for both unite to make it the sweetest, happiest,\r\nthe welcomest singer that was ever winged, like the high angels of\r\nGod's love.  It is the living ecstacy of joy when it mounts up into\r\nits \"glorious privacy of light.\"  On the earth it is timid, silent,\r\nand bashful, as if not at home, and not sure of its right to be\r\nthere at all.  It is rather homely withal, having nothing in\r\nfeather, feature, or form, to attract notice.  It is seemingly made\r\nto be heard, not seen, reversing the old axiom addressed to children\r\nwhen getting voicy.  Its mission is music, and it floods a thousand\r\nacres of the blue sky with it several times a day.  Out of that\r\npalpitating speck of living joy there wells forth a sea of\r\ntwittering ecstacy upon the morning and evening air.  It does not\r\nascend by gyrations, like the eagle or birds of prey.  It mounts up\r\nlike a human aspiration.  It seems to spread out its wings and to be\r\nlifted straight upwards out of sight by the afflatus of its own\r\nhappy heart.  To pour out this in undulating rivulets of rhapsody is\r\napparently the only motive of its ascension.  This it is that has\r\nmade it so loved of all generations.  It is the singing angel of\r\nman's nearest heaven, whose vital breath is music.  Its sweet\r\nwarbling is only the metrical palpitation of its life of joy.  It\r\ngoes up over the roof-trees of the rural hamlet on the wings of its\r\nsong, as if to train the rural soul to trial flights heavenward.\r\nNever did the Creator put a voice of such volume into so small a\r\nliving thing.  It is a marvel--almost a miracle.  In a still hour\r\nyou can hear it at nearly a mile's distance.  When its form is lost\r\nin the hazy lace-work of the sun's rays above, it pours down upon\r\nyou all the thrilling semitones of its song as distinctly as if it\r\nwere warbling to you in your window.\r\n\r\nThe only American bird that could star it with the English lark, and\r\nwin any admiration at a popular concert by its side, is our\r\nfavourite comic singer, the Bobolink.  I have thought often, when\r\nlistening to British birds at their morning rehearsals, what a\r\nsensation would ensue if Master Bob, in his odd-fashioned bib and\r\ntucker, should swagger into their midst, singing one of those Low-\r\nDutch voluntaries which he loves to pour down into the ears of our\r\nmowers in haying time.  Not only would such an apparition and\r\noverture throw the best-trained orchestra of Old World birds into\r\namazement or confusion, but astonish all the human listeners at an\r\nEnglish concert.  With what a wonderment would one of these\r\nblooming, country milkmaids look at the droll harlequin, and listen\r\nto those familiar words of his, set to his own music:-\r\n\r\n      Go to milk! go to milk!\r\n      Oh, Miss Phillisey,\r\n      Dear Miss Phillisey,\r\n      What will Willie say\r\n      If you don't go to milk!\r\n      No cheese, no cheese,\r\n      No butter nor cheese\r\n      If you don't go to milk.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonder that in these days of refined civilization, when\r\nJenny Lind, Grisi, Patti, and other celebrated European singers,\r\nsome of them from very warm climates, are transported to America to\r\ndelight our Upper-Tendom, that there should be no persistent and\r\nsuccessful effort to introduce the English lark into our out-door\r\norchestra of singing-birds.  No European voice would be more welcome\r\nto the American million.  It would be a great gain to the nation,\r\nand be helpful to our religious devotions, as well as to our secular\r\nsatisfactions.  In several of our Sabbath hymns there is poetical\r\nreference to the lark and its song.  For instance, that favorite\r\npsalm of gratitude for returning Spring opens with these lines:--\r\n\r\n     \"The winter is over and gone,\r\n      The thrush whistles sweet on the spray,\r\n      The turtle breathes forth her soft moan,\r\n        The _lark_ mounts on high and warbles away.\"\r\n\r\nNow, not one American man, woman, or child in a thousand ever heard\r\nor saw an English lark, and how is he, she, or it to sing the last\r\nline of the foregoing verse with the spirit and understanding due to\r\nan exercise of devotion?  The American lark never mounts higher than\r\nthe top of a meadow elm, on which it see-saws, and screams, or\r\nquacks, till it is tired; then draws a bee-line for another tree, or\r\na fence-post, never even undulating on the voyage.  It may be said,\r\ntruly enough, that the hymn was written in England.  Still, if sung\r\nin America from generation to generation, we ought to have the\r\nEnglish lark with us, for our children to see and hear, lest they\r\nmay be tempted to believe that other and more serious similes in our\r\nSabbath hymns are founded on fancy instead of fact.\r\n\r\nNor would it be straining the point, nor be dealing in poetical\r\nfancies, if we should predicate upon the introduction of the English\r\nlark into American society a supplementary influence much needed to\r\nunify and nationalise the heterogeneous elements of our population.\r\nMen, women, and children, speaking all the languages and\r\nrepresenting all the countries and races of Europe, are streaming in\r\nupon us weekly in widening currents.  The rapidity with which they\r\nbecome assimilated to the native population is remarkable.  But\r\nthere is one element from abroad that does not Americanise itself so\r\neasily--and that, curiously, is one the most American that comes\r\nfrom Europe--in other words, the _English_.  They find with us\r\neverything as English as it can possibly be out of England--their\r\nlanguage, their laws, their literature, their very bibles, psalm-\r\nbooks, psalm-tunes, the same faith and forms of worship, the same\r\ncommon histories, memories, affinities, affections, and general\r\nstructure of social life and public institutions; yet they are\r\ngenerally the very last to be and feel at home in America.  A\r\nNorwegian mountaineer, in his deerskin doublet, and with a dozen\r\nEnglish words picked up on the voyage, will Americanise himself more\r\nin one year on an Illinois prairie than an intelligent, middle-class\r\nEnglishman will do in ten, in the best society of Massachusetts.\r\nNow, I am not dallying with a facetious fantasy when I express the\r\nopinion, that the life and song of the English lark in America,\r\nsuperadded to the other institutions and influences indicated, would\r\ngo a great way in fusing this hitherto insoluble element, and\r\nblending it harmoniously with the best vitalities of the nation.\r\nAnd this consummation would well repay a special and extraordinary\r\neffect.  Perhaps this expedient would be the most successful of all\r\nthat remain untried.  A single incident will prove that it is more\r\nthan a mere theory.  Here it is, in substance:--\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when the Australian gold fever was hot in the veins\r\nof thousands, and fleets of ships were conveying them to that far-\r\noff, uncultivated world, a poor old woman landed with the great\r\nmultitude of rough and reckless men, who were fired to almost frenzy\r\nby dreams of ponderous nuggets and golden fortunes.  For these they\r\nleft behind them all the enjoyments, endearments, all the softening\r\nsanctities and surroundings of home and social life in England.  For\r\nthese they left mothers, wives, sisters and daughters.  There they\r\nwere, thinly tented in the rain, and the dew, and the mist, a busy,\r\nboisterous, womanless camp of diggers and grubbers, roughing-and-\r\ntumbling it in the scramble for gold mites, with no quiet Sabbath\r\nbreaks, nor Sabbath songs, nor Sabbath bells to measure off and\r\nsweeten a season of rest.  Well, the poor widow, who had her cabin\r\nwithin a few miles of \"the diggings,\" brought with her but few\r\ncomforts from the old homeland--a few simple articles of furniture,\r\nthe bible and psalm-book of her youth, and an English lark to sing\r\nto her solitude the songs that had cheered her on the other side of\r\nthe globe.  And the little thing did it with all the fervor of its\r\nfirst notes in the English sky.  In her cottage window it sang to\r\nher hour by hour at her labor, with a voice never heard before on\r\nthat wild continent.  The strange birds of the land came circling\r\naround in their gorgeous plumage to hear it.  Even four-footed\r\nanimals, of grim countenance, paused to hear it.  Then, one by one,\r\ncame other listeners.  They came reverently, and their voices\r\nsoftened into silence as they listened.  Hard-visaged men, bare-\r\nbreasted and unshaven, came and stood gentle as girls; and tears\r\ncame out upon many a tanned and sun-blistered cheek as the little\r\nbird warbled forth the silvery treble of its song about the green\r\nhedges, the meadow streams, the cottage homes, and all the sunny\r\nmemories of the fatherland.  And they came near unto the lone widow\r\nwith pebbles of gold in their hard and horny hands, and asked her to\r\nsell them the bird, that it might sing to them while they were\r\nbending to the pick and the spade.  She was poor, and the gold was\r\nheavy; yet she could not sell the warbling joy of her life.  But she\r\ntold them that they might come whenever they would to hear it sing.\r\nSo, on Sabbath days, having no other preacher nor teacher, nor\r\nsanctuary privilege, they came down in large companies from their\r\ngold-pits, and listened to the devotional hymns of the lark, and\r\nbecame better and happier men for its music.\r\n\r\nSeriously, it may be urged that the refined tastes, arts, and genius\r\nof the present day do not develop themselves symmetrically or\r\nsimultaneously in this matter.  Here are connoisseurs and\r\nenthusiasts in vegetable nature hunting up and down all the earth's\r\ncontinents for rare trees, plants, shrubs, and flowers.  They are\r\nbringing them to England and America in shiploads, to such extent\r\nand variety, that nearly all the dead languages and many of the\r\nliving are ransacked to furnish names for them.  Llamas,\r\ndromedaries, Cashmere goats, and other strange animals, are brought,\r\nthousands of miles by sea and land, to be acclimatised and\r\ndomesticated to these northern countries.  Artificial lakes are made\r\nfor the cultivation of fish caught in Antipodean streams.  That is\r\nall pleasant and hopeful and proper.  The more of that sort of thing\r\nthe better.  But why not do the other thing, too?  Vattemare made it\r\nthe mission of his life to induce people of different countries to\r\nexchange books, or unneeded duplicates of literature.  We need an\r\nAudubon or Wilson, not to make new collections of feathered\r\nskeletons, and new volumes on ornithology, but to effect an exchange\r\nof living birds between Europe and America; not for caging, not for\r\nZoological gardens and museums, but for singing their free songs in\r\nour fields and forests.  There is no doubt that the English lark\r\nwould thrive and sing as well in America as in this country.  And\r\nour bobolink would be as easily acclimatised in Europe.  Who could\r\nestimate the pleasure which such an exchange in the bird-world would\r\ngive to millions on both sides of the Atlantic?\r\n\r\nThere are some English birds which we could not introduce into the\r\nfeathered society of America, any more than we could import a score\r\nof British Dukes and Duchesses, with all their hereditary dignities\r\nand grand surroundings, into the very heart and centre of our\r\ndemocracy.  For instance, the grave and aristocratic rooks, if\r\ntransported to our country, would turn up their noses and caw with\r\ncontempt at our institutions--even at our oldest buildings and most\r\nsolemn and dignified oaks.  It is very doubtful if they would be\r\nconciliated into any respect for the Capitol or The White House at\r\nWashington.  They have an intuitive and most discriminating\r\nperception of antiquity, and their adhesion to it is invincible.\r\nWhether they came in with the Normans, or before, history does not\r\nsay.  One thing would seem evident.  They are older than the Order\r\nof the Garter, and belonged to feudalism.  They are the living\r\nspirits of feudalism, which have survived its human retainers by\r\nseveral hundred years, and now represent the defunct institution as\r\npretentiously as in King Stephen's day.  They are as fond of old\r\nNorman castles, cathedrals, and churches, as the very ivy itself,\r\nand cling to them with as much pertinacity.  For several hundred\r\ngenerations of bird-life, they and their ancestors have colonised\r\ntheir sable communities in the baronial park-trees of England, and\r\ntheir descendants promise to abide for as many generations to come.\r\nIn size, form, and color they differ but little from the American\r\ncrow, but are swifter on the wing, with greater \"gift of the gab,\"\r\nand less dignified in general deportment, though more given to\r\naristocratic airs.  Although they emigrated from France long before\r\n\"La Democratic Sociale\" was ever heard of in that country, they may\r\nbe considered the founders of the _Socialistic_ theory and practice;\r\nand to this day they live and move in phalansteries, which succeed\r\nfar better than those attempted by the American \"Fourierites\" some\r\nyears ago.  As in human communities, the collision of mind with mind\r\ncontributes fortuitous scintillations of intelligence to their\r\ngeneral enlightenment; so gregarious animals, birds and bees seem to\r\nacquire especial quick-wittedness from similar intercourse.  The\r\nEnglish rook, therefore, is more astute, subtle, and cunning than\r\nour American crow, and some of his feats of legerdemain are quite\r\nvulpine.\r\n\r\nThe jackdaw is to the rook what the Esquimaux is to the Algonquin\r\nIndian; of the same form, color, and general habits, but smaller in\r\nsize.  They are as fond of ancient abbeys and churches as ever were\r\nthe monks of old.  Indeed, they have many monkish habits and\r\npredilections, and chatter over their Latin rituals in the storied\r\ntowers of old Norman cathedrals, and in the belfries of ivy-webbed\r\nchurches in as vivicacious confusion.\r\n\r\nThere is no country in the world of the same size that has so many\r\nbirds in it as England; and there are none so musical and merry.\r\nThey all sing here congregationalwise, just as the people do in the\r\nchurches and chapels of all religious denominations.  As these\r\nbuildings were fashioned in early times after the Gothic order of\r\nelm and oak-tree architecture, so the human worshippers therein\r\nimitated the birds, as well as the branches, of those trees, and\r\nlearned to sing their Sabbath hymns together, young and old, rich\r\nand poor, in the same general uprising and blending of multitudinous\r\nvoices.  I believe everything sings that has wings in England.  And\r\nwell it might, for here it is safe from shot, stones, snares, and\r\nother destructives.  \"Young England\" is not allowed to sport with\r\nfirearms, after the fashion of our American boys.  You hear no\r\njuvenile popping at the small birds of the meadow, thicket, or\r\nhedge-row, in Spring, Summer, or Autumn.  After travelling and\r\nsojourning nearly ten years in the country, I have never seen a boy\r\nthrow a stone at a sparrow, or climb a tree for a bird's-nest.  The\r\nonly birds that are not expected to die a natural death are the\r\npheasant, partridge, grouse, and woodcock; and these are to be\r\nkilled according to the strictest laws and customs, at a certain\r\nseason of the year, and then only by titled or wealthy men who hold\r\ntheir vested interest in the sport among the most rigid and sacred\r\nrights of property.  Thus law, custom, public sentiment, climate,\r\nsoil, and production, all combine to give bird-life a development in\r\nEngland that it attains in no other country.  In no other land is it\r\nso multitudinous and musical; in none is there such ample and varied\r\nprovision for housing and homing it.  Every field is a great bird's-\r\nnest.  The thick, green hedge that surrounds it, and the hedge-trees\r\narising at one or two rods' interval, afford nesting and refuge for\r\nmyriads of these meadow singers.  The groves and thickets are full\r\nof them and their music; so full, indeed, that sometimes every leaf\r\nseems to pulsate with a little piping voice in the general concert.\r\nNor are they confined to the fields, groves, and hedges of the quiet\r\ncountry.  If the census of the sparrows alone in London could be\r\ntaken, they would count up to a larger figure than all the birds of\r\na New England county would reach.  Then there is another interesting\r\nfeature of this companionship.  A great deal of it lasts through the\r\nentire year.  There are ten times as many birds in England as in\r\nAmerica in the winter.  Here the fields are green through the\r\ncoldest months.  No deep and drifting snows cover a frozen earth for\r\nten or twelve weeks, as with us.  There is plenty of shelter and\r\nseeds for birds that can stand an occasional frost or wintry storm,\r\nand a great number of them remain the whole year around the English\r\nhomesteads.\r\n\r\nIf such a difference were a full compensation, our North American\r\nbirds make up in dress what they fall short of English birds in\r\nvoice and musical talent.  The robin redbreast and the goldfinch\r\ncome out in brighter colors than any other beaux and belles of the\r\nseason here; but the latter is only a slender-waisted brunette, and\r\nthe former a plump, strutting, little coxcomb, in a mahogany-colored\r\nwaistcoat.  There is nothing here approaching in vivid colors the\r\nNew England yellow-bird, hang-bird, red-bird, indigo-bird, or even\r\nthe bluebird.  In this, as well as other differences, Nature adjusts\r\nthe system of compensation which is designed to equalise the\r\nconditions of different countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALK WITH AN OLD MAN ON THE WAY--OLD HOUSES IN ENGLAND--THEIR\r\nAMERICAN RELATIONSHIPS--ENGLISH HEDGES AND HEDGE-ROW TREES--THEIR\r\nPROBABLE FATE--CHANGE OF RURAL SCENERY WITHOUT THEM.\r\n\r\nFrom Tiptree I had a pleasant walk to Coggeshall, a unique and\r\nantique town, marked by the quaint and picturesque architecture of\r\nthe Elizabethan regime.  On the way I met an old man, eighty-three\r\nyears of age, busily at work with his wheel-barrow, shovel, and\r\nbush-broom, gathering up the droppings of manure on the road.  I\r\nstopped and had a long talk with him, and learned much of those\r\ningenious and minute industries by which thousands of poor men\r\nhouse, feed, and clothe themselves and their families in a country\r\nsuper-abounding with labor.  He had nearly filled his barrow, after\r\ntrundling it for four miles.  He could sell his little load for 4d.\r\nto a neighboring farmer; but he intended to keep it for a small\r\ngarden patch allotted to him by his son, with whom he lived.  These\r\nfew square yards of land constituted the microscopic point of his\r\nattachment to that great globe still holding in reserve unmeasured\r\nterritories of productive soil, on which nor plough, nor spade, nor\r\nhuman foot, nor life has ever left a lasting mark.  These made his\r\nlittle farm, as large to him and to his octogenarian sinews and\r\nambitions as was the Tiptree Estate to Alderman Mechi.  It filled\r\nhis mind with as busy occupation and as healthy a stimulus.  That\r\nrude barrow, with its clumsy wheel, thinly rimmed with an iron hoop,\r\nwas to him what the steam engine, and two miles of iron tubing, and\r\nall its hose-power were to that eminent agriculturist, of whom he\r\nspoke in terms of high esteem as a neighbor, and even as a\r\ncompetitor.  Proportionately they were on the same footing; the one\r\nwith his 170 square acres, the other with his 170 square feet.  It\r\nwas pleasant and instructive to hear him speak with such sunny and\r\ncheery hope of his earthly lot and doings.  His son was kind and\r\ngood to him.  He could read, and get many good books.  He ate and\r\nslept well.  He was poor but comfortable.  He went to church on\r\nSunday, and thought much of heaven on week days.  His cabbages were\r\na wonder; some with heads as large as a half-bushel measure.  He did\r\nsomething very respectable in the potato and turnip line.  He had\r\ngrown beans and beets which would show well in any market.  He\r\nalways left a strip or corner for flowers.  He loved to grow them;\r\nthey did him good, and stirred up young-man feelings in him.  He\r\nwent on in this way with increased animation, following the lead of\r\na few questions I put in occasionally to give direction to the\r\nnarrative of his experience.  How much I wished I could have\r\nphotographed him as he stood leaning on his shovel, his wrinkled\r\nface and gray, thin hair, moistened with perspiration, while his\r\ncoat lay inside out on one of the handles of his barrow!  The July\r\nsun, that warmed him at his work, would have made an interesting\r\npicture of him, if some one could have held a camera to its eye at\r\nthe moment.  I added a few pennies to his stock-in-trade, and\r\ncontinued my walk, thinking much of that wonderful arrangement of\r\nProvidence by which the infinite alternations and gradations of\r\nhuman life and condition are adjusted; fitting a separate being,\r\nexperience, and attachment to every individual heart; training its\r\ntendrils to cling all its life long to one slightly individualised\r\nlocality, which another could never call home; giving itself and all\r\nits earthly hopes to an occupation which another would esteem a\r\nprison discipline; sucking the honey of contentment out of a\r\ncondition which would be wormwood to another person on the same\r\nsocial level.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Coggeshall, I became again the guest of a Friend, who\r\ngave me the same old welcome and hospitality which I have so often\r\nreceived from the members of that society.  After tea, he took me\r\nabout the town, and showed me those buildings so interesting to an\r\nAmerican--low, one-story houses, with thatched roofs, clay-colored,\r\nwavy walls, rudely-carved lintels, and iron-sash windows opening\r\noutward on hinges like doors, with squares of glass 3 inches by 4;--\r\nhouses which were built before the keel of the Mayflower was laid,\r\nwhich conveyed the Pilgrims to Plymouth Rock.  Here, now! see that\r\none on the other side of the street, looking out upon a modern and\r\nstrange generation through two ivy-browed eyes just lighted up to\r\nvisible speculation by a single candle on the mantel-piece!  A very\r\nanimated and respectable baby was carried out of that door in its\r\nmother's arms, and baptised in the parish church, before William\r\nShakespeare was weaned.  There is a younger house near by, which was\r\na century old when Washington was born.  These unique, old dwellings\r\nof town, village, and hamlet in England, must ever possess an\r\ninterest to the American traveller which the grand and majestic\r\ncathedrals, that fill him with so much admiration, cannot inspire.\r\nWe link the life of our nation more directly to these humbler\r\nbuildings.  Our forefathers went out of these houses to the New\r\nWorld.  The log huts they first erected served them and their\r\nfamilies as homes for a few years; then were given to their horses\r\nand cattle for stabling; then were swept away, as too poor for\r\neither man or beast.  The second generation of houses made greater\r\npretensions to comfort, and had their day, then passed away.  They\r\nwere nearly all one-story, wooden buildings, with a small apartment\r\non each side of a great chimney, and a little bed-roomage in the\r\ngarret for children.  Then followed the large, red, New England\r\nmansion, broadside to the road, two stories high in front, with\r\nnearly a rood of back roof declining to within five or six feet of\r\nthe ground, and covering a great, dark kitchen, flanked on one side\r\nby a bed-room, and on the other by the buttery.  A ponderous chimney\r\narose out of the middle of the building, giving a fire-place of\r\neight feet back to the kitchen, and one of half the dimensions to\r\neach of the other two large rooms--the _north_ and _south_.  For,\r\nlike the republic they founded, its forefathers and ours divided\r\ntheir dwellings by a kind of Mason and Dixon's Line, into two parts,\r\ngiving them these sectional appellations which have represented such\r\nantagonisms and made us such trouble.  Every one of these old-\r\nfashioned houses had its \"North\" and \"South\" rooms on the ground-\r\nfloor, and duplicates, of the same size and name, above, divided by\r\nthe massive, hollow tower, called a chimney.  A double front door,\r\nwith panels, scrolled with rude carving, opened right and left into\r\nthe portly building, which, in the tout ensemble, looked like a New\r\nEngland gentleman of the olden time, in his cocked hat, and hair\r\ndone up in a queue.  These were the houses built \"when George the\r\nThird was King.\"  In these were born the men of the American\r\nRevolution.  They are the oldest left in the land; and, like the\r\nRevolutionary pensioners, they are fast disappearing.  In a few\r\nyears, it will be said the last of them has been levelled to the\r\nground, just as the paragraph will circulate through the newspapers\r\nthat the last soldier of the War of Independence is dead.\r\n\r\nThus, the young generation in America, now reciting in our schools\r\nthe rudimental facts of the common history of the English-speaking\r\nrace, will come to the meridian of manhood at a time when the three\r\nfirst generations of American houses shall have been swept away.\r\nBut, travelling over a space of three centuries' breadth, they will\r\nsee, in these old English dwellings, where the New World broke off\r\nfrom the Old--the houses in which the first settlers of New England\r\nwere born; the churches and chapels in which they were baptised, and\r\nthe school-houses in which they learned the alphabet of the great\r\nlanguage that is to fill the earth with the speech of man's rights\r\nand God's glory.  One hundred millions, speaking the tongue of\r\nShakespeare and Milton on the American continent, and as many\r\nmillions more on continents more recently settled by the same race,\r\nacross the ocean, and across century-seas of time, shall moor their\r\nmemories to these humble dwellings of England's hamlets, and feel\r\nhow many taut and twisted liens attach them to the motherland of\r\nmighty nations.\r\n\r\nOn reckoning up the log of my first day's walk, I found I had made\r\nfull twelve miles by road and field; and was more than satisfied\r\nwith such a trial of country air and exercise, and with the\r\nenjoyment of its scenery and occupations.  The next day I made a\r\nlonger distance still, from Coggeshall to Great Bardfield, or about\r\neighteen miles; and felt at the end that I had established a\r\nreasonable claim to convalescence.  The country on the way was\r\nmarked by the quiet and happy features of diversified plenty.  The\r\ngreen and gold of pastures, meadows, and wheat-fields; the\r\npicturesque interspersion of cottages, gardens, stately mansions,\r\nparks and lawns, all enlivened by a well-proportioned number of\r\nmottled cows feeding or lying along the brook-banks, and sheep\r\ngrazing on the uplands,--all these elements of rural life and\r\nscenery were blended with that fortuitous felicity which makes the\r\ncharm of Nature's country pictures.\r\n\r\nAt Bardfield I was again homed for the night by a Friend; and after\r\ntea made an evening walk with him about the farm of a member of the\r\nsame society, living in the outskirts of the town, who cultivates\r\nabout 400 acres of excellent land, and is considered one of the most\r\npractical and successful agriculturists of Essex.  His fields were\r\nlarger and fewer than I had noticed on my walk in a farm of equal\r\nsize.  This feature indicates the modern improvements in English\r\nfarming more prominently to the cursory observer than any other that\r\nattracts his eye.  It is a rigidly utilitarian innovation on the old\r\nsystem, that does not at all promise to improve the picturesque\r\naspect of the country.  To \"reconstruct the map\" of a county, by\r\nwire-fencing it into squares of 100 acres each, after grubbing up\r\nall the hedges and hedge-trees, would doubtless add seven and a\r\nquarter per cent. to the agricultural production of the shire, and\r\ngratify many a Gradgrind of materialistic economy; but who would\r\nknow England after such a transformation?  One would be prone to\r\nreiterate Patrick's exclamation of surprise, when he first\r\nshouldered a gun and tested the freedom of the forest in America.\r\nSeeing a small bird in the top of a tree, he pointed the fowling-\r\npiece in that direction, turned away his face, and fired.  A tree-\r\ntoad fell to the ground from an agitated branch.  The exulting\r\nIrishman ran and picked it up in triumph, and held it out at arm's\r\nlength by one of its hind legs, exclaiming, \"And how it alters a\r\nbird to shoot its feathers off, to be sure!\"  It would alter England\r\nnearly as much in aspect, if the unsparing despotism of pounds s. d.\r\nshould root out the hedge-row trees, and substitute invisible lines\r\nof wire for the flowering hawthorn as a fencing for those fields\r\nwhich now look so much like framed portraits of Nature's best\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of these utilitarian times may well occasion an\r\nunpleasant concern in the lovers of English rural scenery.  What\r\nchanges may come in the wake of the farmer's steam-engine, steam-\r\nplough, or under the smoke-shadows from his factory-like chimney,\r\nthese recent \"improvements\" may suggest and induce.  One can see in\r\nany direction he may travel these changes going on silently.  Those\r\nlittle, unique fields, defined by lines and shapes unknown to\r\ngeometry, are going out of the rural landscape.  And when they are\r\ngone, they will be missed more than the amateurs of agricultural\r\nartistry imagine at the present moment.  What some one has said of\r\nthe peasantry, may be said, with almost equal deprecation, of these\r\npicturesque tit-bits of land, which,--\r\n\r\n     \"Once destroyed, never can be supplied.\"\r\n\r\nAnd destroyed they will be, as sure as science.  As large farms are\r\nswallowing up the little ones between them, so large fields are\r\nswallowing these interesting patches, the broad-bottomed hedging of\r\nwhich sometimes measures as many square yards as the space it\r\nencloses.\r\n\r\nThere is much reason to fear that the hedge-trees will, in the end,\r\nmeet with a worse fate still.  Practical farmers are beginning to\r\nlook upon them with an evil eye--an eye sharp and severe with\r\npecuniary speculation; that looks at an oak or elm with no artist's\r\nreverence; that darts a hard, dry, timber-estimating glance at the\r\ntrunk and branches; that looks at the circumference of its cold\r\nshadow on the earth beneath, not at the grand contour and glorious\r\nleafage of its boughs above.  The farmer who was taking us over his\r\nlarge and highly-cultivated fields, was a man of wide intelligence,\r\nof excellent tastes, and the means wherewithal to give them free\r\nscope and play.  His library would have satisfied the ambition of a\r\nstudent of history or belles-lettres.  His gardens, lawn, shrubbery,\r\nand flowers would grace the mansion of an independent gentleman.  He\r\nhad an eye to the picturesque as well as practical.  But I could not\r\nbut notice, as significant of the tendency to which I have referred,\r\nthat, on passing a large, outbranching oak standing in the boundary\r\nof two fields, he remarked that the detriment of its shadow could\r\nnot have been less than ten shillings a year for half a century.  As\r\nwe proceeded from field to field, he recurred to the same subject by\r\ncalling our attention to the circumference of the shadow cast on the\r\nbest land of the farm by a thrifty, luxuriant ash, not more than a\r\nfoot in diameter at the butt.  Up to the broad rim of its shade, the\r\nwheat on each side of the hedge was thick, heavyheaded and tall, but\r\nwithin the cool and sunless circle the grain and grass were so pale\r\nand sickly that the bare earth would have been relief to a farmer's\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe three great, distinctive graces of an English landscape are the\r\nhawthorn hedges, the hedge-row trees, and the everlasting and\r\nunapproachable greenness of the grass-fields they surround and\r\nembellish.  In these beautiful features, England surpasses all other\r\ncountries in the world.  These make the peculiar charm of her rural\r\nscenery to a traveller from abroad.  These are the salient\r\nlineaments of Motherland's face which the memories of myriads she\r\nhas sent to people countries beyond the sea cling to with such\r\nfondness; memories that are transmitted from generation to\r\ngeneration; which no political revolutions nor severances affect;\r\nwhich are handed down in the unwritten legends of family life in the\r\nNew World, as well as in the warp and woof of American literature\r\nand history.  Will the utilitarian and unsparing science of these\r\nlatter days, or of the days to come, shear away these beautiful\r\ntresses, and leave the brow and temples of the Old Country they have\r\ngraced bare and brown under the bald and burning sun of material\r\neconomy?  It is not an idle question, nor too early to ask it.  It\r\nis a question which will interest more millions of the English race\r\non the American continent than these home-islands will ever contain.\r\nThere are influences at work which tend to this unhappy issue.  Some\r\nof these have been already indicated, and others more powerful still\r\nmay be mentioned.\r\n\r\nAgriculture in England has to run the gauntlet of many pressing\r\ncompetitions, and carry a heavy burden of taxation as it runs.\r\nThese will be noticed, hereafter, in their proper connection.\r\nFarming, therefore, is being reduced to a rigid science.  Every acre\r\nof land must be put up to its last ounce of production.  Every\r\nsquare foot of it must be utilised to the growth of something for\r\nman and beast.  Manures for different soils are tested with as much\r\nchemical precision as ever was quinine for human constitutions.\r\nDynameters are applied to prove the power of working machinery.\r\nLabor is scrutinised and economised, and measured closely up to the\r\nvalue of a farthing's-worth of capacity.  A shilling's difference\r\nper acre in the cost of ploughing by horse-flesh or steam brings the\r\nlatter into the field.  The sound of the flail is dying out of the\r\nland, and soon will be heard no more.  Even threshing machines\r\nworked by horses are being discarded, as too slow and old-fashioned.\r\nLocomotive steam-engines, on broad-rimmed wheels, may be met on the\r\nturnpike road, travelling on their own legs from farm to farm to\r\nthresh out wheat, barley, oats, and beans, for a few pence per\r\nbushel.  They make nothing of ascending a hill without help, or of\r\nwalking across a ploughed field to a rick-yard.  Iron post and rail\r\nfencing, in lengths of twenty feet on wheels, drawn about by a\r\ndonkey, bids fair to supersede the old wooden hurdles for sheep fed\r\non turnips or clover.  It is an iron age, and wire fencing is\r\ncreeping into use, especially in the most scientifically cultivated\r\ndistricts of Scotland, where the elements and issues of the farmer's\r\nbalance-sheet are looked to with the most eager concern.  Iron wire\r\ngrows faster than hawthorn or buckthorn.  It doubtless costs less.\r\nIt needs no yearly trimming, like shrubs with sap and leaves.  It\r\ndoes not occupy a furrow's width as a boundary between two fields.\r\nIt may be easily transposed to vary enclosures.  It is not a nesting\r\nplace for destructive birds or vermin.  These and other arguments,\r\nof the same utilitarian genus, are making perceptible headway.  Will\r\nthey ever carry the day against the green hedges?  I think they\r\nwould, very soon, if the English farmer owned the land he\r\ncultivates.  But such is rarely the case.  Still, this fact may not\r\nprevent the final consummation of this policy of material interest.\r\nIn a great many instances, the tenant might compromise with the\r\nlandlord in such a way as to bring about this \"modern improvement.\"\r\nAnd a comparatively few instances, showing a certain per centage of\r\nincreased production per acre to the former, and a little additional\r\nrentage to the latter, would suffice to give the innovation an\r\nimpulse that would sweep away half the hedges of the country, and\r\ndeface that picture which so many generations have loved to such\r\nenthusiasm of admiration.\r\n\r\nWill the trees of the hedge-row be exposed to the same end?  I think\r\nthey will.  Though trees are the most sacred things the earth begets\r\nin England, as has already been said, the farmer here looks at them\r\nwith an evil eye, as horse-leeches that bleed to death long\r\nstretches of the land he pays 2 pounds per acre for annually to his\r\nlandlord.  The hedge, however wide-bottomed, is his fence; and\r\nfencing he must have.  But these trees, arising at narrow intervals\r\nfrom the hedge, and spreading out their deadening shades upon his\r\nwheatfields on either side, are not useful nor ornamental to him.\r\nThey may look prettily, and make a nice picture in the eyes of the\r\nsentimental tourist or traveller, but he grudges the ground they\r\ncover.  He could well afford to pay the landlord an additional\r\nrentage per annum more than equal to the money value of the yearly\r\ngrowth of these trees.  Besides, the landlord has, in all\r\nprobability, a large park of trees around his mansion, and perhaps\r\ncompact plantations on land unsuited to agriculture.  Thus the high\r\nvalue of these hedge-row trees around the fields of his tenant,\r\nwhich he will realise on the spot, together with some additional\r\npounds in rent annually to himself and heirs, would probably\r\nfacilitate this levelling arrangement in face of all the\r\nrestrictions that the law of entail might seem to throw in the way.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the hedges of England disappear before the noiseless\r\nand furtive progress of utilitarian science, the trees that rise\r\nabove them in such picturesque ranks will be almost certain to go\r\nwith them.  Then, indeed, a change will come over the face of the\r\ncountry, which will make it difficult for one to recognise it who\r\ndaguerreotyped its most beautiful features upon his memory before\r\nthey were obliterated by these latter-day \"improvements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOOTPATH WALK AND ITS INCIDENTS--HARVEST ASPECTS--ENGLISH AND\r\nAMERICAN SKIES--HUMBLER OBJECTS OF CONTEMPLATION--THE DONKEY:  ITS\r\nUSES AND ABUSES.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast the following morning, my kind host\r\naccompanied me for a mile on my walk, and put me on a footpath\r\nacross the fields, by which I might save a considerable distance on\r\nthe way to Saffron Walden, where I proposed to spend the Sabbath.\r\nAfter giving me minute directions as to the course I was to follow,\r\nhe bade me good-bye, and I proceeded on at a brisk pace through\r\nfields of wheat and clover, greatly enjoying the scenery, the air,\r\nand exercise.  Soon I came to a large field quite recently ploughed\r\nup _clean_, footpath and all.  Seeing a gate at each of the opposite\r\ncorners, I made my way across the furrows to the one at the left, as\r\nit seemed to be more in the direction indicated by my host.  There\r\nthe path was again broad and well-trodden, and I followed it through\r\nmany fields of grain yellowing to the harvest, until it opened into\r\nthe main road.  This bore a little more to the left than I expected,\r\nbut, as I had never travelled it before, I believed it was all\r\nright.  Thaxted was half way to Saffron Walden, and there I had\r\nintended to stop an hour or two for dinner and rest, then push on to\r\nthe end of the day's walk as speedily as possible.  At about noon, I\r\ncame suddenly down upon the town, which seemed remarkably similar to\r\nthe one I had left, in size, situation, and general features.  The\r\nparish church, also, bore a strong resemblance to the one I had\r\nnoticed the previous evening.  These old Essex towns are \"as much\r\nalike as two peas,\" and you must make a note of it, as Captain\r\nCuttle says, was the thought first suggested by the coincidence.  I\r\nwent into a cosy, clean-faced inn on the main street, and addressed\r\nmyself with much satisfaction to a short season of rest and\r\nrefreshment, exchanging hot and dusty boots for slippers, and going\r\nthrough other preliminaries to a comfortable time of it.  Rang the\r\nbell for dinner, but before ordering it, asked the waiting-maid,\r\nwith a complacent idea that I had improved my walking pace, and made\r\nmore than half the way--\r\n\r\n\"How far is it to Saffron Walden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelve miles, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelve miles, indeed!  Why, it is only twelve miles from Great\r\nBardfield!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, this is Great Bardfield, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Bardfield!  What!  How is this?  What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nShe meant what she said, and it was as true as two and two make\r\nfour; and she was not to be beaten out of it by a stare of\r\nastonishment, however a discomfited man might expand his eyes with\r\nwonder, or cloud his face with chagrin.  It was a patent fact.\r\nThere, on the opposite side of the street, was the house in which I\r\nslept the night before; and here, just coming up to the door of the\r\ninn, was the good lady of my host.  Her form and voice, and other\r\nidentifications dispelled the mist of the mistake; and it came out\r\nas clear as day that I had followed the direction of my host, to\r\nbear to the left, far too liberally, and that I had been walking at\r\nmy best speed in a \"vicious circle\" for full two hours and a half,\r\nand had landed just where I commenced, at least within the breadth\r\nof a narrow street of the same point.\r\n\r\nMy good friends urged me to stop and dine with them, and then make a\r\nfair start for the end of my week's journey.  But it was still\r\ntwelve miles to Saffron Walden, and I was determined to put half of\r\nthem behind me before dinner.  So, taking a second leave of them in\r\nthe course of three hours, I set out again on my walk, a wiser man\r\nin the practical understanding of the proverb, \"The longest way\r\naround is the shortest way there.\"  At 2 p.m.  I reached Thaxted,\r\nand rectified my first notion of the town, formed when I mistook it\r\nfor Bardfield.  Having made six miles extra between the two points,\r\nI resumed my walk after a short delay at the latter.\r\n\r\nThe weather was glorious.  A cloudless sun shone upon a little sky-\r\ncrystalled world of beauty, smaller in every dimension than you ever\r\nsee in America.  And this is a feature of English scenery that will\r\nstrike the American traveller most impressively at the first glance,\r\nwhether he looks at it by night or day.  It is not that Nature, in\r\nadjusting the symmetries of her scenic structures, nicely apportions\r\nthe skyscape to the landscape of a country merely for artistic\r\neffect.  It is not because the island of Great Britain is so small\r\nin circumference that the sky is proportioned to it, as the crystal\r\nis to the dial of a watch; that it is so apparently low; that the\r\nstars it holds to its moist, blue bosom are so near at midnight, and\r\nthe sun so large at noon.  It comes, doubtless, from that constant\r\nhumidity of the atmosphere which distinguishes the climate of\r\nEngland, and gives to both land and sky an aspect which is quite\r\nunknown to our great western continent.  An American, after having\r\nhabituated himself to this aspect, on returning to his own country,\r\nwill be almost surprised at a feature of its scenery which he never\r\nnoticed before.  He will be struck at the loftiness of the sky; at\r\nthe vividness of its blue and gold, the sharp, unsoftened light of\r\nthe stars, and, as it were, the contracted pupil of the sun's eye at\r\nmid-day.  The sunset glories of our western heavens play upon a\r\nground of rigid blue.  \"The Northern Lights,\" which, at their winter\r\nevening illuminations, seem to have shredded into wavy filaments all\r\nthe rainbows that have spanned the chambers of the East since the\r\nFlood, and to upspring, in mirthful fantasy, to hang their\r\ninfinitely-tinted tresses to the zenith's golden diadem of stars--\r\neven they sport upon the same lofty concave of dewless blue, which\r\nlooks through and through the lacework and everchanging drapery of\r\ntheir mingled hues in the most witching mazes of their nightly\r\nwaltz, giving to each a definiteness that our homely Saxon tongue\r\nmight fit with a name.\r\n\r\nBut here, on the lower grounds of instructive meditation, is a\r\nhumbler individuality of the country to notice.  Here is the most\r\nsadly abused and melancholy living creature in all England's animal\r\nrealm that meets me in the midst of these reflections on things\r\nsupernal and glorious.  I will let the Northern Lights go, with\r\ntheir gorgeous pantomimes and midnight revelries, and have a\r\nmoment's communing with this unfortunate quadruped.  It is called in\r\nderision here a \"_donkey_,\" but an ass, in a more generous time,\r\nwhen one of his race and size bore upon his back into the Holy City\r\nthe world's Saviour and Re-Creator.  Poor, libelled, hopeless beast!\r\nI pity you from my heart's heart.  How I wish for Sterne's pen to do\r\nyou some measure of justice or condolence under this heavy load of\r\nopprobrium that bends your back and makes your life so sunless and\r\nbitter!  Come here, sir!--here is a biscuit for you, of the finest\r\nwheat; few of your race get such morsels; so, eat it and be\r\nthankful.  What ears!  No wonder our friend Patrick called you \"the\r\nfather of all rabbits\" at first sight.  No! don't turn away your\r\nhead, as if I were going to strike you.\r\n\r\nMost animals are best described from a certain point of _view_,--in\r\na fixed and quiescent attitude.  But the donkey should be taken in\r\nthe very act of this characteristic motion.  You put out your hand\r\nin the gentlest manner to pat any one of them you meet, and he will\r\ninstinctively turn away his head for fear of a beating.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting speculation now coming up among modern\r\nreveries in regard to the immortality of certain animals of great\r\nintelligence and domestic virtues.  A large and tender kindness of\r\ndisposition is the father of the thought, it may be; but the thought\r\nseems to gain ground and take shape, that so much of apparently\r\nhuman mind and heart as the dog possesses cannot be destined to\r\nannihilation at his death, but must live and enlarge in another\r\nsphere of existence.  Having thus opened, if it may be said\r\nreverently, a back-door into immortality for sagacious and\r\naffectionate dogs and horses, they leave it ajar for the admission\r\nof animals of less intelligence--even for all the kinds that Noah\r\ntook into the ark, perhaps, although the theory is still nebulous\r\nand undefined.  Now, I would beg the kind-hearted adherents to this\r\ntheory not to think I am seeking to play off a satirical pleasantry\r\nupon it, if I express a hope, which is earnest and true, that, if\r\nthere be an immortality for any class of dumb animals, the donkey\r\nshall go into it first, and have a better place in it than their\r\nparlor dogs or nicely-groomed horses.  Evidently they are building\r\nup a claim to this illustrious distinction of another existence for\r\nthese pets on the sole ground of merit, not of works, even, but of\r\nmere intelligence, fidelity, and affection.  Granted; but the donkey\r\nshould go in first and take the highest place on that basis.  When\r\nyou come to the standard of moral measurement, it may be claimed as\r\namong the highest of human as well as animal virtues, \"to learn to\r\nsuffer and be strong.\"  And this virtue the donkey has learned and\r\npractised incomparably beyond any other creature that ever walked on\r\nfour legs since the Flood.  Let these good people remember that\r\ntheir fanciful and romantic favoritisms are not to rule in the\r\ndestinies awarded to the infinitesimally human spirits of domestic\r\nanimals in another world, if another be in reserve for them.  Let\r\nthem remember that their softly-cushioned dogs, and horses so\r\ndelicately clad, and fed, and fondled, have had a pretty good time\r\nof it in this life, and that in another, the poor, despised, abused\r\ndonkey, going about begging, with such a long and melancholy face,\r\nfor withered cabbage leaves and woody-grained turnips cast out and\r\ntrodden under feet of happier animals,--that this meek little\r\ncreature, kicked, cuffed, and club-beaten all the way from hopeless\r\nyouth to an ignominious grave, will carry into another world merits\r\nand mementoes of his earthly lot that will obtain, if not entitle\r\nhim to, some compensation in the award of a future condition.  It is\r\ntreading on delicate ground even to set one foot within the pale of\r\ntheir unscriptural theory; but as many of them hold the Christian\r\nfaith in pureness of living and doctrine, let me remind them of that\r\nparable which shows so impressively how the disparities in human\r\ncondition here are reversed in the destinies of the great hereafter.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to the earthly lot and position of this poor,\r\nlibelled animal.  Among all the four-footed creatures domesticated\r\nto the service of man, this has always been the veriest scapegoat\r\nand victim of the cruellest and crabbedest of human dispositions.\r\nTruly, it has ever been born unto sorrow, bearing all its life long\r\na weight of abuse and contumely which would break the heart of a\r\nless sensitive animal in a single week.  From the beginning it has\r\nbeen the poor man's beast of burden; and \"pity 'tis 'tis true,\" poor\r\nmen, in all the generations of human poverty, have been far too\r\nprone to harshness of temper and treatment towards the beasts that\r\nserve them and share their lot of humble life.  The donkey is made a\r\nkind of Ishmaelite in the great family of domestic animals.  He is\r\nmade, not born so.  He is beaten about the head unmercifully with a\r\nheavy stick, and then jeered at for being stupid and obstinate! just\r\nas if any other creature, of four or two legs, would not be stupid\r\nafter such fierce congestion of the brain.  His long ears subject\r\nhim to a more cruel prejudice than ever color engendered in the\r\ncircle of humanity but just above him.  True, he is rather\r\nunsymmetrical in form.  His head is disproportionately long and\r\nlarge, quite sufficient in these dimensions to fit a camel.  He is\r\ngenerally a hollow-backed, pot-bellied creature, about the size of a\r\nyearling calf, with ungainly, sloping haunches, and long, coarse\r\nhair.  But nearly all these deformities come out of the shameful\r\ntreatment he gets.  You occasionally meet one that might hold up its\r\nhead in any animal society; with straight back, symmetrical body and\r\nlimbs, and hair as soft and sleek as the fur of a Maltese cat; with\r\ncontented face, and hopeful and happy eyes, showing that he has a\r\nkind master.\r\n\r\nThe donkey is really a useful and valuable animal, which might be\r\nintroduced into America with great advantage to our farmers.  I know\r\nof no animal of its size so tough and strong.  It is astonishing, as\r\nwell as shocking, to see what loads he is made to draw here.  The\r\nvehicle to which he is usually harnessed is a heavy, solid affair,\r\nfrequently as large as our common horse-carts.  He is put to all\r\nkinds of work, and is almost exclusively the poor man's beast of\r\nburden and travel.  In cities and large towns, his cart is loaded\r\nwith the infinitely-varied wares of street trade; with cabbages,\r\nfish, fruit, or with some of the thousand-and-one nicknacks that\r\nfind a market among the masses of the common people.  At watering-\r\nplaces, or on the \"commons\" or suburban playgrounds of large towns,\r\nhe is brought out in a handsome saddle, or a well got-up little\r\ncarriage, and let by the hour or by the ride to invalid adults, or\r\nto children bubbling over with life.  Here, although the everlasting\r\nclub, to which he is born, is wielded by his driver, he often looks\r\ncomfortable and sleek, and sometimes wears a red ribbon at each ear.\r\nIt would not pay to bring on to the ground the scrawny, bony\r\ncreature that generally tugs in the costermonger's cart.  It is in\r\nthe coal region or trade that you meet with him and his driver in\r\ntheir worst apostacy from all that is seemly in man or beast.  To\r\nwatch the poor creature, begrimed with coal-dust, wriggling up a\r\nlong, steep hill, with a load four times his own weight, griping\r\nwith his little sheep-footed hoofs into the black, slimy pavement of\r\nthe road, while his tall, sooty-faced and harsh-voiced master,\r\nperhaps sitting on the top or on a shaft, is punching and beating\r\nhim; to see this is enough to stir up the old adam in the meekest\r\nChristian to emotions of pugilistic indignation.  It has often cost\r\nme a doubtful and protracted effort to keep it down.  Indeed, I have\r\noften yielded to it so far as to wish that once more the poor\r\ncreature might be honored of God with His gift to Balaam's ass, and\r\nbe able to speak, bolt outright, an indignant remonstrance, in human\r\nspeech, against such treatment.  It would serve them right!--these\r\nlineal descendants of Balaam, who have inherited his club and wield\r\nit more cruelly.\r\n\r\nA word or two more about this animal, and I will pass on to others\r\nof more dignity of position.  He is the cheapest as well as smallest\r\nbeast of burden to be found in Christendom.  You may buy one here\r\nfor twenty or thirty English shillings.  I am confident that they\r\nwould be extremely serviceable in America, if once introduced.  It\r\ncosts but very little to keep them, and they will do all kinds of\r\nwork up to the draught of 600 or 800 lbs.  You frequently see here a\r\nspan of them trotting off in a cart, with brisk and even step.\r\nSometimes they are put on as leaders to a team of horses.  I once\r\nsaw on my walk a heavy Lincolnshire horse in the shafts, a pony\r\nnext, and a donkey at the head, making a team graduated from 18\r\nhands to 6 in height; and all pulling evenly, and apparently keeping\r\nstep with each other, notwithstanding the disparity in the length of\r\ntheir legs.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to that goodwill to man and beast which is being\r\norganised and stimulated in England through an infinite number of\r\nsocieties, if I should omit to state that, at last, a little rill of\r\nthis benevolence has reached the donkey.  That most valuable and\r\nwidely-circulated penny magazine, \"The British Workman,\" and its\r\nlittle companion for British workmen's children, \"The Band of Hope\r\nReview,\" have advocated the rights and better treatment of this\r\nhumble domestic for several years.  His cause has also been pleaded\r\nin a packet of little papers called \"Leaflets of the Law of Kindness\r\nfor the Children.\"  And now, at last, a wealthy and benevolent\r\nchampion, on whom the mantle of Elizabeth Fry, his aunt, has fallen,\r\nhas taken the lead in the work of raising the useful creature to the\r\nlevel of the other animals of the pasture, stable, and barn-yard.\r\nUp to the present time, every creature that walks on four or two\r\nlegs, either haired, woolled, or feathered, with the single\r\nexception of the donkey has had the door of the Agricultural\r\nExhibition thrown wide open to it, to enter the lists for prizes or\r\n\"honorable mention,\" and for general admiration.  A pig, whose legs\r\nand eyes have all been absorbed out of sight by an immense rotundity\r\nof fat, is often decked with a ribbon, of the Order of the Garter\r\ngenus, as a reward of merit, or of grace of form and proportions!\r\nTurkeys, geese, ducks, and hens of different breeds, strut or waddle\r\noff with similar distinctions.  As for blood-horses, bulls, cows,\r\nand sheep, one not versed in such matters might be tempted to think\r\nthat men, especially the poorer sort, were made for beasts, and not\r\nbeasts for men.  And yet, mirabile dictu! at these great social\r\ngatherings of man-and-animal kind, there has not been even \"a negro-\r\npew\" for the donkey.  A genuine, raw, Guinea negro might have as\r\nwell entered the Prince of Wales' Ball in New York bare-footed, and\r\noffered to play a voluntary on his banjo for the dancers, as this\r\ndespised quadruped have hoped to obtain the entree to these grand\r\nand fashionable assemblies of the shorter-eared elite of society.\r\n\r\nBut this prejudice against color and long ears is now going the way\r\nof other barbarisms.  The gentleman to whom I have referred, a\r\nMember of Parliament, whose means are as large as his benevolence,\r\nhas taken the first and decisive step towards raising the donkey to\r\nhis true place in society.  He has offered a liberal prize for the\r\nbest conditioned one exhibited at the next Agricultural Fair.  Since\r\nthis offer was made, a very decided improvement has been noticed\r\namong the donkeys of the London costermongers, as if the competition\r\nfor the first prize was to be a very large one.\r\n\r\nIt will be a kind of St. Crispin's Day to the whole of the long-\r\neared race--a day of emancipation from forty centuries of obloquy\r\nand oppression.  Doubtless they will be admitted hereafter to the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society's exhibitions, to compete for honors with\r\nanimals that have hitherto spurned such association with contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITALITIES OF \"FRIENDS\"--HARVEST ASPECTS--ENGLISH COUNTRY INNS;\r\nTHEIR APPEARANCE, NAMES, AND DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS--THE\r\nLANDLADY, WAITER, CHAMBERMAID, AND BOOTS--EXTRA FEES AND EXTRA\r\nCOMFORTS.\r\n\r\nI reached Saffron Walden at 4 p.m., notwithstanding my involuntary\r\nwalk of six extra miles in the morning.  Here I remained over the\r\nSabbath, again enjoying the hospitality of a Friend.  And perhaps I\r\nmay say it here and now with as much propriety as at any other time\r\nand place, that few persons, outside the pale of that society, have\r\nmore frequently or fully enjoyed that hospitality than myself.  This\r\npleasant experience has covered the space of more than sixteen\r\nyears.  During this period, with the exception of short intervals, I\r\nhave been occupied with movements which the Friends in England have\r\nalways regarded with especial sympathy.  This connection has brought\r\nme into acquaintance with members of the society in almost every\r\ntown in Great Britain in which they reside; and in more than a\r\nhundred of their homes I have been received as a guest with a\r\nkindness which will make to my life's end one of its sunniest\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday, I resumed my walk northward, after a\r\ncarriage ride which a Friend kindly gave me for a few miles on the\r\nway.  Passed through a pre-eminently grain-producing district.\r\nApparently full three-fourths of the land were covered with wheat,\r\nbarley, oats, and beans.  The fields of each were larger than I had\r\nnoticed before; some containing 100 acres.  The coming harvest is\r\nputting forth the full glory of its golden promise.  The weather is\r\nall a farmer could wish, beautiful, warm, and bright.  Nature, in\r\nevery feature of its various scapes, seems to smile with the joy of\r\nthat human happiness which her ministries inspire.  Here, in these\r\nstill expanses, waving with luxuriant crops, apparently so thinly\r\npeopled, one, forgetting the immense populations crowded into city\r\nspaces, is almost tempted to ask, where are all the mouths to eat\r\nthis wide sea of food for man and beast, softening so gently into a\r\nyellow sheen under the very rim of the distant horizon?  But, in the\r\ngreat heart of London, beating with the wants of millions, he will\r\nbe likely to reverse the question, and ask, where can one buy bread\r\nwherewith to feed this great multitude?\r\n\r\nAt Sawston, a rustic little village on the southern border of\r\nCambridgeshire, I entered upon the enjoyment of English country-inn\r\nlife with that relish which no one born in a foreign land can so\r\nfully feel as an American.  As one looks upon the living face of\r\nsome distinguished celebrity for the first time, after having had\r\nhis portrait hung up in the parlor for twenty years, so an American\r\nlooks, for the first time, at that great and picturesque speciality\r\namong human institutions, the village inn of old England.  The like\r\nof it he never saw in his own country and never will.  In fact, he\r\nwould not like to see it there, plucked up out of its ancient\r\nhistories and associations.  In the ever-green foliage of these it\r\nstands inwoven, as with its own network of ivy.  Other countries,\r\neven older than England, have had their taverns from time\r\nimmemorial; but they are all kept in the background of human life.\r\nThey do not come out in contemporaneous history with any\r\ndefiniteness; not even accidentally.  If a king is murdered in one\r\nof them, or if it is the theatre of the most thrilling romance of\r\nlove, you do not know whether it is a building of stone, brick, or\r\nwood; whether it is one, two, or three stories in height.  No\r\noutlines nor aspects are given you to help to fill up a rational\r\npicture of it.  Neither the landlord nor the landlady is drawn as a\r\nrepresentative man or woman.  Either might be mistaken for a guest\r\nin their own house, if seen in hat or bonnet by a stranger.\r\n\r\nBut not so of the English country inn.  It comes out into the\r\nforeground of a thousand interesting histories and pictures of\r\ncommon life.  In them it has an individuality as marked as the\r\nparish church, couchante in its wide-rimmed nest of grave stones; as\r\nmarked in unique architecture, location, and surroundings.  In none\r\nof these features will you find two alike, if you travel from one\r\nend of the country to the other; especially among those a century\r\nold.  You might as well mistake one of the living animals for the\r\nother, as to mistake \"The Blue Boar\" for \"The Red Lion.\"  They\r\ndiffer as much from each other in general make and aspect as do\r\ntheir nominal prototypes.  To give every one of their thousands \"a\r\nlocal habitation and a name\" of striking distinctness, has required\r\nan ingenuity which has produced many interesting feats of house-\r\nbuilding and nomenclature.  Both these departments of genius figure\r\nlargely in the poetry and classics of the institution, with which\r\nthe reading million of America have been familiar from youth up.\r\nAnd when any of them come to travel in England, it will greatly\r\nenhance their enjoyment to find that the pictures they have admired\r\nand the descriptions they have read of the famous country inn have\r\nbeen true to the very life and letter.  All its salient features\r\nthey recognise at once, and are ready to exclaim, \"How natural!\"\r\nmeaning by that, how true is the original to the picture which they\r\nhave seen so frequently.  If they go far enough, they will find the\r\nvery original of every one of the hundred pictures they have seen,\r\npainted by pen or pencil.  They will find that all of them have been\r\ntrue copies from nature.  Here is the portly-looking, well-to-do,\r\ntwo-story tavern, standing out with its comfortable, cream-colored\r\nface broadside to the street.  It is represented in the old\r\nengraving with a coach-and-four drawn up before the door, surrounded\r\nby a crowd of spectators and passengers, some descending and\r\nascending on ladders over the forward wheels; some looking with\r\nadmiration at the scarlet coats of the pursy and consequential\r\ndriver and guard; some exchanging greetings, others farewell\r\nsalutations; ostlers in long waistcoats, plush or fustian shorts,\r\nand yellow leggings, standing bareheaded with watering-pails at the\r\n\"'osses' 'eads;\" trunks great and small going up and down; village\r\nboys in high excitement; village grandfathers looking very animated;\r\nthe landlord, burly, bland, and happy, with a face as rotund and\r\ngenial as the full moon shining upon the scene; and those round,\r\nrosy, sunny, laughing faces peering out of the windows with\r\ndelightful wonderment and exhilaration, winked at by the driver, and\r\nsaluted with a graceful motion of his whip-handle in recognition of\r\nthe barmaid, chambermaid, and all the other maids of the house.  The\r\ncoach, with all its picturesque appointments, its four-in-hand, the\r\nstirring heraldry of its horn coming down the road, its rattling\r\nwheels, the life and stir aroused and moved in its wake,--all this\r\nhas gone from the presence of a higher civilisation.  It will never\r\nre-appear in future pictures of actual life in England.  It is all\r\ngone where the hedges and hedge-row trees will probably go in their\r\nturn.  But the same village inn remains, and can be as easily\r\nrecognised as a widow in weeds, who still wears a hopeful face, and\r\nmakes the best of her bereavement.\r\n\r\nBut that humbler type of hostelry so often represented in sketches\r\nof English rural life and scenery--the little, cozy, one-story,\r\nwayside, or hamlet inn, with its thatched roof, checker-work window,\r\nlow door, and with a loaded hay-cart standing in front of it, while\r\nthe driver, in his round, wool hat, and in his smock-frock, is\r\ndrinking at a pewter mug of beer, with one hand on his horse's neck-\r\n-this the hand of modern improvements has not yet reached.  This may\r\nbe found still in a thousand villages and hamlets, surrounded with\r\nall its rural associations; the green, the geese, and gray donkeys\r\nfeeding side by side; low-jointed cottages, with long, sloping roofs\r\ngreened over with moss or grass, and other objects usually shadowed\r\ndimly in the background of the picture.  It is these quiet hamlets\r\nand houses in the still depths of the country, away from the noise\r\nand bluster of railway life and motion, that best represent and\r\nperpetuate the primeval characteristics of a nation.  These the\r\nAmerican traveller will find invested with all the old charm with\r\nwhich his fancy clothed them.  It will well repay him for a month's\r\nwalk to see and enjoy them thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIn these days of sun-literature, whose letters are human faces, and\r\nwhose new volumes are numbered by the million yearly, without a\r\nduplicate to one of them, I am confident that a volume of these\r\nEnglish village inns of the olden school, in photographs, would\r\ncommand a large sale and admiration in America, merely as specimens\r\nof unique and interesting architecture.  A thousand might be taken,\r\nevery one as unlike the other in distinctive form and feature, as\r\nevery one of the same number of men would be to the other.\r\n\r\nThe diversification of names, being more difficult, is still more\r\nremarkable.  Although the spread eagle figures largely as the patron\r\ngenius of American hotels, still nine-tenths of them bear the names\r\nof states, counties, towns, or national or local celebrities.  But\r\nhere natural history comes out strong and wide.  The heraldry of\r\nsovereigns, aristocracy, gentry, commercial and industrial\r\ninterests, puts up its various _arms_ upon hundreds of inns in town\r\nand country.  All occupations and recreations are well represented.\r\nThus no country in the world approaches England in the wide scope\r\nand play of hotel nomenclature.  Some of the combinations are\r\nexceedingly unique and most interesting in their incongruity.\r\nDickens has not exaggerated this characteristic; not even done it\r\njustice in his hotel scenes.  Things are put together on a hundred\r\ntavern signs that were never joined before in the natural or moral\r\nworld, and put together frequently in most grotesque association.\r\nFor instance, there is a large, first-class inn right in the very\r\nheart of London, which has for a sign, not painted on a board, but\r\nlet into the wall of the upper story, in solid statuary, a huge\r\nhuman mouth opened to its utmost capacity, and a bull, round and\r\nplump, standing stoutly on its four legs between the two distended\r\njaws.  Now, the leading idea of this device is involved in a\r\ntempting obscurity, which leads one, at first sight, into different\r\nlines of conjecture.  What did the designer of this group of\r\nstatuary really intend to represent?  Was it to let the outside\r\nworld know that, in that inn, the \"Roast Beef of Old England\" was\r\nalways to be found par excellence?  If so, would a man's mouth\r\nswallowing a bull whole, and apparently alive, with hide and horns,\r\ntend to stimulate the appetite of a passing traveller, and to draw\r\nhim into the establishment?  But leaving these ambiguous symbols to\r\nbe interpreted by the passing public according to different\r\nperceptions of their meaning, how many in a thousand would guess\r\naright the name given to the tavern by these tokens?  Would not\r\nninety-nine in a hundred say, \"The Mouth and Bull,\" to be sure, not\r\nonly on the principle that the major includes the minor, but also\r\nbecause the human element is entitled to precedence in the picture?\r\nBut the ninety-nine would be completely mistaken, if they adopted\r\nthis natural conclusion.  They would find they had counted without\r\ntheir host, who knows better than they the relative position and\r\nvalue of things.  What has the law of logic to do with fat beef?\r\nThe name of his famous hotel is \"THE BULL AND MOUTH;\" and few in\r\nLondon have attained to its celebrity as a historical building.  One\r\nis apt to wonder if this precedence given to the beast is really\r\nincidental, or adopted to give euphony to the name of an inn, or\r\nwhether there is a latent and spontaneous leaning to such a method\r\nof association, from some cause or other connected with perceptions\r\nof personal comfort afforded at such establishments.  Accidental or\r\nintentional, this form of association is very common.  There is no\r\ntavern in London better known than The Elephant and Castle, a\r\ndesignation that would sound equally well if the two substantives\r\nwere transposed.  Even the loftiest symbols of sovereignty often\r\noccupy the secondary place in these compound titles.  There are,\r\ndoubtless, a hundred inns in Great Britain bearing the name of The\r\nRose and Crown, but not one, to my knowledge, called \"The Crown and\r\nRose.\"  The same order obtains in sporting sections and terminology.\r\nIt is always \"The _Hare_ and Hounds;\" never \"_Hounds_ and Hare.\"\r\n\r\nThis characteristic in itself is very interesting, and no American,\r\nwith an eye to the unique, would like to see it changed.  But if the\r\nmore syntax of hotel names in England is so pleasant for him to\r\nstudy, how much more admirable is their variety!  He has read at\r\nhome of many of them in lively romance and grave history but he\r\nfinds here that not half has been told him.  He is familiar with the\r\nLions, Red, White, and Black; the Bulls and Boars of the same\r\ncolors; the Black and White Swans and Harts; the Crown and Anchor,\r\nthe Royal George, Queen's Head, and a few others of similar\r\ndesignation.  These names have figured in volumes of English\r\nliterature which he has perused.  But let him travel on the turnpike\r\nroad through country towns and villages, and he will meet with names\r\nhe never thought of before, mounted over the doors of some of the\r\nmost comfortable and delightful houses of entertainment for man and\r\nbeast that can be found in the world.  Here are a few that I have\r\nnoticed:  \"The Three Jolly Butchers,\" \"The Old Mash Tub,\" \"The Old\r\nMermaid,\" \"The Old Malt Shovel,\" \"The Chequers,\" \"The Dog-in-\r\nDoublet,\" \"Bishop Boniface,\" \"The Spotted Cow,\" \"The Green Dragon,\"\r\n\"The Three Horseshoes,\" \"The Bird-in-Hand,\" \"The Spare Rib,\" \"The\r\nOld Cock,\" \"Pop goes the Weasel.\"  There are wide spaces between\r\nthese names which may be filled up from actual life with numbers of\r\nequal uniqueness.  But it is not in architecture nor in name that\r\nthe country inn presents its most attractive characteristic.  These\r\nfeatures merely specialise its outward corporeity.  The living,\r\nbrightening, all-pervading soul of the establishment is the\r\nLANDLADY.  Let her name be written in capitals evermore.  There is\r\nnothing so naturally, speakingly, and gloriously English in the wide\r\nworld as she.  It is doubtful if the nation is aware of this, but it\r\nis the fact.  Her English individuality stands out embonpoint, rosy,\r\ngenial, self-complacent, calm, serene, happyfying, and happy.  She\r\nis the man and master of the house.  She permeates it with her\r\nrayful presence, and fills it with a pleasant morning in foggy and\r\nblue-spirited days.  She it is who greets the coming and speeds the\r\nparting guest with a grace which suns, with equal light and warmth,\r\nboth remembrance and anticipation.  It is not put on like a Sunday\r\ndress; it is not a thin gloss of French politeness that a feather,\r\nblown the wrong way, will brush off.  It is not a color; it is a\r\nquality.  You see it breathe and move in her like a nature, not as\r\nan art.  Let no American traveller fancy he has seen England if he\r\nhas not seen the Landlady of the village inn.  If he has to miss\r\none, he had better give up his visit to the Crystal Palace,\r\nStratford-upon-Avon, Abbottsford, or even the House of Lords, or\r\nWindsor itself.  Neither is so perfectly and exclusively English as\r\nthe mistress of \"The Brindled Cow,\" in one of the rural counties of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt would be necessary to coin a new word if one were sought to\r\ncontain and convey the distinctive characteristic of inn-life in\r\nEngland.  Perhaps _homefulness_ would do this best, as it would more\r\nfully than any other term describe the coziness, quiet, and comfort\r\nto be enjoyed at these places of entertainment.  Not one in a\r\nhundred of them ever heard the sound of the hotel-going bell, as we\r\nhear it in America.  You are not thundered up or down by a\r\nvociferous gong.  Then there is no marching nor counter-marching of\r\na long line of waiters in white jackets around the dinner table,\r\nlaying down plate, knife, fork, and spoon with uniform step and\r\nmotion, as if going through a dress-parade or a military drill.\r\nThere is no bustle, no noise, no eager nor anxious look of served or\r\nservants.  Every one is calm, collected, and comfortable.  \"The\r\ncares that infest the day\" do not ride into the presence of that\r\nroast beef and plum pudding on the wrinkles of any man's forehead,\r\nhowever business affairs may go with him outside.  No one is in a\r\nhurry to sit down or to arise from the table.  The whole economy of\r\nthe establishment is to make you as much at home as possible; to\r\nindividualise you, as far as it can be done, in every department of\r\npersonal comfort.  You follow your own time and inclination, and eat\r\nand drink when and how you please, with others or alone.  The\r\ncongregate system is the exception, not the rule.  It seldom ever\r\nobtains at breakfast or tea.  In many cases you have a little round\r\ntable all to yourself at these meals.  But if there is a common\r\ntable for half a dozen persons, the tea and toast and other eatables\r\nare never aggregated into a common stock.  Each person if he is a\r\nsingle guest, has his own allotment, even to a separate tea-pot.\r\nThe table d'hote, if there be one at all, is made up like a select\r\ndinner party, rather early in the morning.  If the guests of the\r\nhouse are not directly invited, they are asked, in a tone of\r\nhospitality, if they will join in the social meal, the only one got\r\nup by the establishment at which the table is not mapped out in\r\nseparate holdings, or little independencies of dishes, each bounded\r\nby the wants and capacities of the individual occupant.\r\n\r\nThe presiding and working faculty of a common English inn\r\ndistinguishes it by another salient characteristic from the hotels\r\nof other countries.  The landlady is, of course, the president of\r\nthe establishment, whether or not she calls any man lord in the\r\nretired and family department of the house.  But the actual\r\ngerantes, or working corps, with which you have to do immediately,\r\nare three independent and distinct personages, called the waiter,\r\nchambermaid, and _boots_.  If it were respectful to gender, these\r\nmight be called the great triumvirate of the English inn.  No\r\ntraveller after a night's lodging and breakfast, will mistake or\r\nconfound the prerogatives or perquisites of these officials.  If he\r\nis an American, and it be his first experience of the regime, he\r\nwill be surprised and puzzled at the imperium in imperio which his\r\nbill, presented to him on a tea-tray, seems to represent.  In no\r\nother business transaction of his life did he ever see the like.  It\r\ngoes far beyond anything in the line of limited partnership he ever\r\nsaw.  There is only one partial parallel that approaches it; and\r\nthis comes to his mind as he reads the several items on his bill.\r\nWhen made out and interpreted, it comes to this:  the proprietor,\r\nthe waiter, chambermaid, and boots are independent parties, who get\r\nup a night's lodging and two or three meals for you on the same\r\nfooting as four independent underwriters would take proportionate\r\nrisks at Lloyd's in some ship at sea.  Or, what would put it in\r\nsimpler form to an uninitiated guest, he is apparently first charged\r\nfor the raw provisions he consumes, and for the rent of his bed-\r\nroom.  This is the proprietor's share.  Then, there is a separate\r\ncharge for each of the remaining items of the entertainment,--for\r\ncooking and serving up each meal, for making up your bed, and for\r\nblacking your boots; just as distinctly as if you had gone out into\r\nthe town the previous evening and hired three separate individuals\r\nto perform these services for you; and as if you had no right nor\r\nreason to expect from the landlord a dinner all cooked and served,\r\nbut that you only bought it in the larder.\r\n\r\nNow, this is a peculiarity of the English hotel system that is apt\r\nto embarrass travellers from other countries, especially from\r\nAmerica, where no such custom could be introduced.  I do not know\r\nhow old the custom is in Great Britain.  Doubtless it originated in\r\nthe almost universal disposition and habit of Englishmen of dropping\r\ngratuities or charity-gifts here and there with liberal hand, either\r\nto obtain or reward extra service in matters of personal comfort, or\r\nto alleviate some case of actual or stimulated suffering that meets\r\nthem.  It was natural and inevitable that gratuities thus given to\r\nhotel servants frequently to stimulate and reward special attention\r\nshould soon become a rule, acting upon guests like a law of honor.\r\nWhen so many gave, and when the servants of every hotel expected a\r\ngift, a man must feel shabby to go away without dropping a few\r\npennies into the hands of eager expectants who almost claimed the\r\ngratuity as a right.  The worst stage of the system was when the\r\nexpected gift was measured by your supposed position and ability, or\r\nwhen the waiter or the chambermaid, flattering you with what\r\nFalstaff would call an instinctive perception of your dignity, would\r\nsay with an asking and hopeful smile, \"What you please, sir.\"  Now,\r\nthat was not the question with you at all.  You wanted to know how\r\nmuch each expected, or how much you must give to acquit yourself of\r\nthe charge of being \"a screw,\" when they put their heads and gains\r\ntogether in conference and comparison after you were gone.  So, on\r\nthe whole, it was a great relief when all these awkward\r\nuncertainties of expectation were cleared up and rectified in the\r\nsystem now usually adopted.\r\n\r\nWhether you be rich or poor, or whatever position or pretension be\r\nattributed to you, the fees of the universal triumvirate are put\r\ndown specifically in black and white among the other charges on your\r\nbill.  As I hope these notes may convey some useful information to\r\nAmericans who may be about to visit England for the first time, it\r\nmay be of some use to them to state what is the usual rule in this\r\nmatter at the middle-class hotels in this country; for with those of\r\nthe first rank I never have made nor ever expect to make any\r\npersonal acquaintance.  A moderate bill for a day's entertainment\r\nwill read thus:--\r\n\r\n                                                     s.d.\r\nTea (bread and butter or toast)                      1 0\r\nBed                                                  1 6\r\nBreakfast (rasher of bacon, eggs, or cold meats)     1 6\r\nDinner                                               2 6\r\nWaiter                                               0 9\r\nChambermaid                                          0 6\r\nBoots                                                0 3\r\n                                                     ----\r\n                                        Total        8 0\r\n\r\nThese are about the average charges at the middle-class hotels in\r\nGreat Britain.  Generally the servants' fees amount to 25 per cent.\r\nof the whole bill.  These, too, are graduated to parts of days.  The\r\nwaiter expects 3d. for every meal he serves; the chambermaid 6d. for\r\nevery bed she makes, and the boots 3d. for doing every pair of\r\nboots, brogans, or shoes.  You will pay these charges with all the\r\nbetter grace and good-will to these servants when you come to learn\r\nthat these fees frequently, if not always, constitute all the salary\r\nthey receive for hotel service.  Even in a great number of eating-\r\nshops the same rule obtains.  The penny you give the waiter, male or\r\nfemale, is all he or she gets for serving you.  Besides this\r\nconsideration, you get back much additional personal comfort from\r\nthese extras.  The waiter serves you with extra satisfaction and\r\nassiduity under their stimulus.  He acts the host very blandly.  He\r\nanswers a hundred questions, extraneous to the meal, with good-\r\nnatured readiness.  He is a good judge of the weather and its signs.\r\nHe is well \"posted-up\" in the local histories and sceneries of the\r\nplace.  He can give political information on both sides, incidents\r\nand anecdotes to match, whether you are Tory, Whig, or Radical.  If\r\nyou have a bias in that direction, he has or has heard some thoughts\r\non Bishop Colenso and the Tractarians.  In short, he caters to the\r\nhumour and disposition of every guest with a happy facility of\r\nadaptation; and the shilling you give him at the end of a day's\r\nentertainment has been pretty well earned, if you have availed\r\nyourself of all these extra attentions which he is prepared and\r\nexpecting to give for it.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the chambermaid.  She is not the taciturn\r\ninvisible that steals in and out of your bed-room, and does it up\r\nwhen you are at breakfast or at your out-door business--whom you\r\nnever see, except by sheer accident, as in the American hotel.  She\r\nis an important and prominent personage in the English inn.  She is\r\na kind of mistress of the robes, and exercises her prerogative with\r\nmuch conscious dignity and self-satisfaction; and, what is better,\r\nwith great satisfaction to yourself.  No other subordinate official\r\nor servant trenches or poaches upon her preserves.  She it is who\r\nprecedes you up stairs with a candle, on a broad-bottomed brass\r\ncandlestick, polished to its highest lustre.  She conducts you to\r\nyour room as if you were her personal guest, invited and expected a\r\nmonth ago.  She opens the door with amiable complacency, as if\r\nwelcoming you to a hospitality which she had prepared for you with\r\nespecial care, before she knew you had arrived in town.  She invites\r\nyou, by a movement of her eyes, to glance at the room and see how\r\ncomfortable it is; how round and soft is the bed, how white and\r\nwell-aired are the sheets and pillows, how nice the curtains, how\r\nclean and tidy the carpet, in short, how everything is fitted to\r\nincline you to \"rest and be thankful.\"  And then the cheery \"_good\r\nnight_!\" she bids you is said with a tone that is worth the sixpence\r\nshe expects in the morning; and you pay it, too, with a much better\r\ngrace than could be expected from an American recently arrived in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAnd the \"boots\" is a character, too, unmixedly and interestingly\r\nEnglish, in name, person, appearance, and position.  In the first of\r\nthese qualities he is unique, being called after the subject of his\r\noccupation.  He is an important personage, and generally has his own\r\nbell in the dining-room, surmounted by his name, to be called for\r\nany service coming within his department.  And this is quite a wide\r\none, including a great variety of errandry and porterage, as well as\r\npolishing boots and shoes.  He is very helpful in a great many\r\ndifferent ways, and often very intelligent, and knows all about the\r\nstreets, the railway trains, the omnibuses, cabs, etc., and will\r\nassist you in such matters with good grace and activity.  He may\r\nhave got in the way of putting the H before the eggs instead of the\r\nham; but he is just as good for all that, and more interesting\r\nbesides.  So you do not grudge the 3d. you give him daily for his\r\nstrictly professional services, or the extra 6d. he expects for\r\ncarrying your carpet-bag or portmanteau to the railway-station.\r\n\r\nThus, although this feeing of servants may seem at first strange to\r\nan American traveller in England, and may occasion him some\r\nperplexity and even annoyance, he will soon become accustomed to it;\r\nand in making up the balance-sheet of the additional cost on one\r\nside and the additional comfort on the other which the system\r\nproduces, he will come even to the mathematical conclusion, \"if to\r\nequals you add equals, the sums will be equals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT OF HUMAN LIVES--PHOTOGRAPHS AND BIOGRAPHS--THE LATE JONAS\r\nWEBB, HIS LIFE, LABORS, AND MEMORY.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I resumed my walk and visited a locality bearing a\r\nname and association of world-wide celebrity and interest.  It is\r\nthe name of a small rural hamlet, hardly large enough to be called a\r\nvillage, and marked by no trait of nature or art to give it\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nThere are conditions and characteristics both in the natural and\r\nmoral world which can hardly be described fully in Saxon, Latin, or\r\nGreek terminology, even with the largest license of construction.\r\nThere are attributes or qualities attaching to certain locations, of\r\nthe simplest natural features, which cannot even be hinted at or\r\nsuggested by the terms, _geography, topography, or biography_.  Put\r\nthe three together and condense or collocate their several meanings\r\nin one compound qualification which you can write and another spell,\r\nand you do not compass the signification you want to convey.  The\r\nsoul of man has its immortality, and the feeblest-minded peasant\r\nbelieves he shall wear it through the ages of the great hereafter.\r\nThe literature of human thoughts claims a life that shall endure as\r\nlong as the future existence of humanity.  The memory of many human\r\nactions and lives puts in a plea and promise of a duration that\r\nshall distance the sun's, and overlap upon the bright centuries of\r\neternity.  The human body, even, is promised its resurrection by the\r\ndivinest authority and illustration, and waits hopefully, under all\r\nits pains and weaknesses, for the glory to be revealed in it when\r\nthe earth on which it dwells shall have become \"a forgotten\r\ncircumstance.\"  Human loves, remembrances, faiths, and fellowships\r\nlift up all their meek hands to the Father of Spirits, praying to be\r\nlifted up into His great immortality, and to be permitted to take\r\nwith them unbroken the associations that sweetened this earthly\r\nlife.  Many humble souls that have passed through the furnace of\r\naffliction, poverty, and trial seven times heated, and heated daily\r\nhere, have believed that He who went up through the same suffering\r\nto His great White Throne, would let them sing beside the crystal\r\nwaters the same good old psalm tunes and songs of Sion which they\r\nsang under the willows of this lower world of tears and tribulation.\r\nHow all the sparks of the undying life in man fly upward to the\r\nzenith of this immortality!  You may call the steep flights of this\r\nfaith pleasant and poetical diversions of a fervid imagination, but\r\nthey are winged with the pinions that angels lift when they soar;\r\npinions less ethereal than theirs, but formed and plumed to beat\r\nupward on the Milky Way to their Source, instead of swimming in the\r\nthinly-starred cerulean, in which spirits, never touched with the\r\ndown or dust of human attributes, descend and ascend on their\r\nmissions to the earth.  Who can have the heart to handle harshly\r\nthese beautiful faiths?  To say, this hope may go up, but this must\r\ngo down to the darkness of annihilation!  Was it irreverent in the\r\npious singing-master of a New England village, when he said, that\r\noften, while returning home late on bright winter nights, he had\r\ndropped the reins upon his horse's neck, and sung Old Hundred from\r\nthe stars, set as notes to that holy tune, when they first sang\r\ntogether in the morning of the creation?  What spiritual good or\r\nChristian end would be gained, to break up the charm and cheer of\r\nthis his belief?  Or to dispel that other confidence, which so\r\nhelped him to bear earth's trials, that one day he should join all\r\nthe spirits of the just made perfect, and all the high angels in\r\nheaven, and, on the plane of that golden gamut, they should sing\r\ntogether their hymns of joy and praise, in that same, good, old\r\ntune, from those same star-notes, which a thousand centuries should\r\nnot deflect nor transpose from their first order within those\r\neverlasting staves and bars!\r\n\r\nIf the spirit's faith be allowed such wide confidences as these; if\r\nit may carry up into the invisible and infinite so many precious\r\nrelics from the wreck of time, so many human circumstances and\r\nassociations, why may it not take with it, to hang up in its heaven,\r\nphotographs of those earthly localities rendered immortal here by\r\nthe lives of good and great men?  Such a life is a sun, and it casts\r\na disk of light upon the very earth on which it shines; not that\r\nflashy circle which the lens of the microscope casts upon the\r\nopposite wall, to show how scarcely visible mites may be magnified;\r\nbut a soft and steady illumination that does not dim under the\r\nbeating storms and bleaching dews of centuries, but grows brighter\r\nand brighter, as if the seed-rays that made it first multiplied\r\nthemselves from year to year.  The earth becomes more and more\r\nthickly dotted with these permanent disks of light, and each is\r\nvisited by pilgrims, who go and stand with reverence and admiration\r\nwithin the cheering circle.  Shakespeare's thought-life threw out a\r\nbrilliant illumination, of wide circumference, at Stratford-upon-\r\nAvon, and no locality in England bears a biograph more venerated\r\nthan the birth-place of the great poet.  His thought-life was a sun\r\nthat will never set as long as this above us shines.  It is rising\r\nevery year to new generations that never saw its rays before.  When\r\nhe laid down his pen, at the end of his last drama, the whole\r\nEnglish-speaking race in both hemispheres did not number twice the\r\npresent population of London.  Now, seventy-five millions, peopling\r\nmighty continents, speak the tongue he raised to the grandest of all\r\nearth's speeches; and those who people the antipodes claim to offer\r\nthe best homage to his genius.  Thus it will go on to the end of\r\ntime.  As the language he clothed with such power and might shall\r\nspread itself over the earth, and be spoken, too, by races born to\r\nanother tongue, his life-rays will permeate the minds of countless\r\nmyriads, and the more widely they diverge and the farther they\r\nreach, the brighter and warmer will be the glow and the flow of that\r\ndisk of light that embosoms and illumines his birth-place in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of Stratford-upon-Avon is equally true of Abbotsford,\r\nof the birth-place of Milton, Burns, Bunyan, Baxter, and other great\r\nminds, which have shone each like a sun or star in its sphere.  Now,\r\nwhat one word, recognised as legitimate in scientific terminology,\r\nwould describe fully one of these disks of light cast by a human\r\nlife upon a certain space of earth, not as a fugitive flash, but as\r\na permanent illumination?  _Photograph_ would not do it, because its\r\nmeaning is fixed and rigidly technical, as simple light-writing, or\r\nsun-writing.  The term is completely pre-occupied by this\r\nsignification, and you cannot inject the human life element into it.\r\n_Biography_ is universally limited to an operation in which the life\r\nis the subject, not the agent.  It is simply the writing out of a\r\nlife's history by some one with a common goose-quill or steel pen.\r\nStill, the word _biograph_ would be the best, of the same length,\r\nthat we could form to describe one of these disks of light, if it\r\nwere made the same verb active as _photograph_; or to mean that the\r\nlife is the agent, as well as the subject,--that it writes itself in\r\nlight upon a certain locality, just as the sun graves a human face\r\nupon glass.  Let us then call the bright and quenchless\r\nplanispheres, which such lives describe and fill around them,\r\n_biographs_, assuming that the script is in rays of light.  As\r\ndiffer the stars above in glory, so these differ in the qualities of\r\ntheir illumination.  The brightest of them, to mere human seeming,\r\nare those which shine with the sheer brilliancy of intellect and\r\ngenius.  These chiefly halo the homes of \"the grand old masters\" of\r\npoetry, painting, eloquence, and martial glory.  These attract to\r\ntheir disks pilgrims the most numerous and enthusiastic.  But, as\r\nthe nearest stars are brightest, not largest, so these biographs are\r\nbrightest on their earth-side.  There are thousands of less sharp\r\nand spangling lustre to the eyes of the multitude, which shine with\r\ntenfold more brilliancy from their eternity-face.  These are they\r\nthat halo the homes of good men, whose great hearts drank in the\r\nlife of God's love in perpetual streams, and distilled it like a\r\nluminous dew around them; men whose thoughts were not mere\r\nscintillations of genius, but living labors of beneficence, bearing\r\nthe proof as well as promise of that immortality guaranteed to the\r\ndeeds of earth's saints.  If the soul, after such long isolation, is\r\nto take again to its embrace so much of the old human corporeity it\r\nwore here below, does it transcend the prerogative of hope in the\r\ngreat resurrection to believe that these biographs of God's loving\r\nchildren on earth shall be taken up whole into the same immortality\r\nas the bodies in which they worked His will among men?  Is the faith\r\ntoo fanciful or irreverent that believes, that the corridors and\r\ninner temples of Heaven's Glory will be hung with these biographs of\r\nHis servants surrounding, like stars, the light-flood of His love\r\nthat radiated from His cross on earth?  Is it too presumptuous to\r\nthink and say, that such pictures will be as precious in His sight\r\nas any graven by the lives of angels on their outward or homeward\r\nflights of duty and delight?  These are they, therefore, that shall\r\ngive to the earth all the immortality to which it shall attain.\r\nThese are they that shall take up into the brilliant existence of\r\nthe hereafter, ten thousand sections of its corporeity; portions of\r\nits surface, perhaps, as substantial as the human form that the\r\nsouls of men shall wear in another world.  These are they that shall\r\nshine as the stars, when those beaming so brilliantly in our eyes\r\naround the shrines of mere intellect and genius, shall have \"paled\r\ntheir ineffectual fires\" before the efflux of diviner light.  Let\r\nhim, then, of thoughtful and attentive faculties think on these\r\ngreat and holy possibilities, when he treads within the pale of a\r\ngood man's life, whose labors for human happiness \"follow him\"\r\naccording to divine promise; not out of the world, not down into the\r\ngrave with his resting body, but out among living generations,\r\nbreathing upon them and through them a blessed and everlasting\r\ninfluence.  Let him tread that disk of light reverentially, for it\r\nis the holiest place on the earth's surface outside the immediate\r\ncircumference of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThis is Babraham; and here lived Jonas Webb; a good man and true,\r\nwhose influence and usefulness had a broader circumference than the\r\nwidest empire in the world.  A Frenchman has written the fullest\r\nhistory of both, and an American here offers reverentially a tribute\r\nto his worth.  The light of his life was a soft and gentle\r\nillumination on its earth-side; the lustre of the other was revealed\r\nonly by partial glimpses to those who leaned closest to him in the\r\ntesting-moments of his higher nature.  He was one of the great\r\nbenefactors, whose lives and labors become the common inheritance of\r\nmankind, and whose names go down through long generations with a\r\npleasant memory.  To a certain extent, he was to the great primeval\r\nindustry of the world, what Arkwright, Watts, Stephenson, Fulton and\r\nMorse were each to the mechanical and scientific activities of the\r\nage.  He did as much, perhaps, as any man that ever preceded him, to\r\nhonor that industry, and lift it up to the level of the first\r\noccupations of modern times, which had claimed higher qualities of\r\nintelligence, genius and enterprize.  He was a farmer, and his\r\nancestors had been farmers from time immemorial.  He did not bound\r\ninto the occupation as an enthusiastic amateur, who had acquired a\r\nlarge fortune by manufacturing or commercial enterprize, which he\r\nwas eager to lavish upon bold and uncertain experiments.  He\r\nattained his highest eminence by the careful gradations of a\r\ncontinuous experience, reaching back far into the labors of his\r\nancestors.  The science, skill and judgment he brought to bear upon\r\nhis operations, came from his reading, thinking, observations and\r\nexperiments as a practical and hereditary farmer.  The capital he\r\nemployed in expanding these operations to their culminating\r\nmagnitude, he acquired by farming.  The mental culture, the generous\r\ndispositions, the refined manners, the graceful and manly bearing\r\nwhich made him one of the first gentlemen of the age, he acquired as\r\na farmer.  The mansion which welcomed to its easy and large-hearted\r\nhospitalities guests of such distinction from his own and other\r\ncountries, was a farmer's home, and few ever opened their doors to\r\nmore urbanity and cordial cheer.  This is an aspect of his character\r\nwhich all those who follow the profession he honored should admire\r\nwith a laudable esprit de corps.\r\n\r\nAs a back-ground is an important element in the portraiture of human\r\nforms or natural scenery, so the ground on which the life and labors\r\nof Jonas Webb should be sketched, merits a few preliminary lines.\r\nOf all the occupations that employ and sustain the toiling myriads\r\nof our race, agriculture leans closest to the bosom of Divine\r\nProvidence.  It is an industry bound to the great and beautiful\r\neconomics of the creation by more visible and sensible ties than any\r\nother worked by human hands.  We will not here diverge to dwell upon\r\nthese high and interesting affiliations.  In their place we will\r\ngive them a little extended thought.  There is one feature of\r\nagricultural enterprize, however, that should not be overlooked in\r\nthis connection.  All its operations are above-board and open to the\r\nwide world, just like the fields to which they are applied.  Nothing\r\nhere is under lock and key.  Nothing bears the grim warning over the\r\nbolted door, \"No admittance here except on business!\"--meaning by\r\nbusiness, exclusively and sharply, the buying of certain wares of\r\nthe establishment at a good round profit to the manufacturer,\r\nwithout carrying away a single scintillation or suggestion of his\r\nskill.  If he has invented or adopted machinery or a process of\r\nlabor which enables him to turn out cheap muslin at three farthings'\r\nless cost per yard than his neighbors can make it, he seals up the\r\nsecret from them with the keenest vigilance.  Not so in the great\r\nand heaven-honored industry of agriculture.  Its experiments and\r\nimprovements upon the earth's face are all put into the common stock\r\nof human knowledge and happiness.  They can no more be placed under\r\nlock and key, as selfish secrets, than the stars themselves that\r\nlook down upon them with all their golden eyes.  No new implement of\r\nhusbandry, no new mechanical force or chemical principle, no new\r\nprocess of labor or line of economy is withheld from the great\r\ncommonwealth of mankind.  As the broad skies above, as the sun and\r\nmoon, and stars, as the winds, the rains, the dews, the birds and\r\nbees of heaven over-ride and ignore, in their missions, the\r\nboundaries of jealous nations, so all the great activities of\r\nagriculture prove their lineage by following the same generous rule.\r\nThey are bounded by no nationalities.  They are shut up in no narrow\r\nenclosure of self, but are put out as new vesicles of light to\r\nbrighten the general illumination of the world.\r\n\r\nThe department in which Jonas Webb attained to his position and\r\ncapacity of usefulness was peculiarly marked by this characteristic.\r\nIn a certain sense, it occupied a higher range of interest than that\r\nsection of agriculture which is connected solely with the growing of\r\ngrain, grass, and other crops.  His great and distinguishing\r\nhusbandry was the cultivation of animal life.  To make two spires of\r\ngrass grow where only one grew before has been pronounced as a great\r\nbenefaction; and greater still are the merit and the gain of making\r\none grow where nothing grew before.  To go into the midst of\r\nDartmoor, and turn an acre of its cold, stony, water-soaked waste\r\ninto a fruitful field of golden grain, is going into co-partnership\r\nwith Providence in the work of creation to a very large and honored\r\ndegree.  But to put the skilful hand of science upon creatures of\r\nflesh and blood, to re-form their physical structures and shapes, to\r\nadd new inches to their stature, straighten their backs, expand\r\ntheir reins, amplify their chests, reduce all the lines and curves\r\nof their forms to an unborn symmetry, and then to give silky\r\nsoftness and texture to their aboriginal clothing--this seems to be\r\nmounting one step higher in the attainment and dignity of creative\r\nfaculties.  And this pre-eminently was the department in which Jonas\r\nWebb acquired a distinction perhaps unparalleled to the present\r\ntime.  This has made his name familiar all over Christendom, and\r\nhonored among the world's benefactors.  Never, before him, did a\r\nfarm-stead become such a centre and have such a wide-sweeping radius\r\nas his.  None ever possessed such centripetal attractions, or\r\nexerted such centrifugal influences for the material well-being of\r\ndifferent and distant countries.  Indeed, those most remote are most\r\nspecially indebted to his large and generous operations.  America\r\nand Australia will ever owe his memory an everlasting homage.\r\n\r\nHis operations filled and crowned two great departments of\r\nimprovement seldom, if ever, carried on simultaneously and evenly to\r\na great success by one man.  His first distinguishing speciality was\r\nsheep-culture.  When he had brought this to the highest standard of\r\nperfection ever attained, he devoted the surplus capital of skill,\r\nexperience and pecuniary means he had acquired from the process to\r\nthe breeding of cattle; and he became nearly as eminent in this\r\nfield of improvement as in the other.  A few facts may serve as an\r\noutline of his progress in both to the American reader who is\r\nfamiliar with the general result of his efforts.\r\n\r\nJonas Webb was born at Great Thurlow, Suffolk, on the 10th of\r\nNovember, 1796.  His father, who died at the age of ninety-three,\r\nwas a veteran in agriculture, and had attained to honorable\r\ndistinction by his efforts to improve the old Norfolk breed of\r\nsheep, and by his experiments with other races.  The results\r\nobtained from these operations convinced his son that more mutton\r\nand better wool could be made per acre from the Southdown than from\r\nany other breed, upon nine-tenths of the arable land of England,\r\nwhere the sheep are regularly folded, especially where the land is\r\npoor.  In 1822, he commenced that agricultural career which won for\r\nhim such a world-wide celebrity, by taking the Babraham Farm,\r\noccupying about 1,000 acres, some twelve miles south of Cambridge.\r\nIn a very interesting letter, addressed to the Farmers' Magazine,\r\nabout twenty years since, he gives a valuable resume of his\r\nexperience up to that time.  In this he states several facts that\r\nmay be especially useful to American agriculturists.  Having decided\r\nin his own mind that the Southdowns were preferable to every other\r\nbreed, for the two properties mentioned, he went into Sussex, their\r\nnative county, and purchased the best rams and ewes that could be\r\nobtained of the principal breeders, regardless of expense, and never\r\nmade a cross from any other breed afterwards.  Nor was this all; he\r\nnever introduced new blood into his stock from flocks of the same\r\nbreed, but, by a virtually in-and-in process, he was able to produce\r\nqualities till then unknown to the race, and to make them permanent\r\nand distinctive properties.  Now this achievement in itself has an\r\ninterest beyond its utilitarian value to the agricultural world.  To\r\n\r\n     \"Rejoice in the joy of well-created things\"\r\n\r\nis one of the best privileges and pleasures of a well-constituted\r\nmind.  But what higher honor can attach to human science or industry\r\nthan that of taking such a visible and effective part in that\r\ncreation?--in sending out into the world successive generations of\r\nanimal life, bearing each, through future ages and distant\r\ncountries, the shaping impress of human fingers, long since gone\r\nback to their dust; features, forms, lines, curves, qualities and\r\ncharacteristics which those fingers, working, as it were, on the\r\nright wrist of Divine Providence, gave to the sheep and cattle upon\r\na thousand hills in both hemispheres?  There are flocks and herds\r\nnow grazing upon the boundless prairies of America, the vast plains\r\nof Australia, the steppes of Russia, as well as on the smaller and\r\ngreener pastures of England, France, and Germany, that bear these\r\nfinger-marks of Jonas Webb, as mindless but everlasting memories to\r\nhis worth.  If the owners of these \"well-created things\" value the\r\njoy and profit which they thus derive from his long and laborious\r\nyears of devotion to their interests, let them see that these\r\nfinger-prints of his be not obliterated by their neglect, but be\r\nperpetuated for ever, both for their own good and for an ever-living\r\nmemorial to his name.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of instructive suggestion, that although Mr. Webb\r\ncommenced his operations in 1822, he won his first prize for stock\r\newes at the meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society at Cambridge\r\nin 1840.  Here he realised one of the serious disadvantages to which\r\nstock-breeders in England are exposed, in \"showing\" sheep, cattle or\r\nswine at these annual exhibitions.  The great outside world, with\r\ntastes that lean more to fat sirloins or shoulders than to the\r\nbetter symmetries of animated nature, almost demands that every one\r\nof these unfortunate beasts should be offered up as a bloated,\r\nblowing sacrifice to those great twin idols of fleshy lust, Tallow\r\nand Lard.  If, therefore, a stock-raiser has not decided to drive\r\nhis Shorthorn cow or Southdown ewe immediately from the Fair-grounds\r\nto the butcher's shambles, he runs an imminent risk of losing\r\nentirely the use and value of the animal.  So great is this risk,\r\nthat much of the stock that would be most useful for exhibition is\r\nwithheld, and can only be seen by visiting private establishments\r\nscattered over the kingdom.  They are too valuable to run the\r\nterrible gauntlet of oil-cake, bean and barley-meal, through which\r\nthey must flounder on in cruel obesity to the prize.  Especially is\r\nthis the case with breeding animals.  Mr. Webb's experience at his\r\nfirst trial of the process, will illustrate its tendencies and\r\nresults.  Of the nine shearling ewes he \"fed\" for the Cambridge\r\nShow, he lost _four_, and only raised two or three lambs from the\r\nrest.  At the Exhibition of 1841, at Liverpool, he won three out of\r\nfour of the prizes offered by the Royal Agricultural Society for\r\nSouthdowns, or any other short-woolled sheep; two out of four\r\noffered at Bristol, in 1842, and three out of four offered at Derby,\r\nin 1843.  But here again he over-fed two of his best sheep, under\r\nthe inexorable rule of fat, which exercises such despotic sway over\r\nthese annual competitions, and was obliged to kill them before the\r\nshow.  It will suffice to show the loss he incurred by this costly\r\nhomage to Tallow, to give his own words on the subject:--\"I had\r\nrefused 180 guineas for the hire of the two sheep for the season.  I\r\nalso quite destroyed the usefulness of two other aged sheep by over-\r\nfeeding them last year.  Neither of them propogated [sic] through\r\nthe season, and I have had each of them killed in consequence, which\r\nhas so completely tired me of overfeeding that I never intend\r\nexhibiting another aged ram, unless I greatly alter my mind, or can\r\nfind out some method of feeding them which will not destroy the\r\nanimals, and which I have hitherto failed to accomplish.\"  The\r\nconclusion which he adopted, in view of these liabilities, may be\r\nuseful to agriculturists in America as well as in England.  He says,\r\n\"What I intend exhibiting in future will be shearlings only, as I\r\nbelieve they are not so easily injured by extra feeding as aged\r\nsheep, partly by being more active, and partly by having more time\r\nto put on their extra condition, by which their constitutions are\r\nnot likely to be so much impaired.\"\r\n\r\nAt nearly every subsequent national exhibition, Mr. Webb carried off\r\nthe best prizes for Southdowns.  At Dundee, in 1843, the Highland\r\nSociety paid him the compliment of having the likenesses of his\r\nsheep taken for its museum in Edinburgh.  He only received two\r\nchecks in these competitions after 1840, and these he rectified and\r\novercame in an interesting way.  The first took place at the great\r\nmeeting at Exeter, in 1850, and the second at Chelmsford, in 1856.\r\nOn both of these occasions he was convinced that the judges had not\r\ndone justice to the qualities of his animals, and he resolved to\r\nsubmit their judgment to a court of errors, or to the decision of a\r\nsubsequent meeting of the society.  So, in 1851, he presented the\r\nunsuccessful candidate at Exeter to the meeting at Windsor, and took\r\nthe first prize for it.  This fully reversed the Exeter verdict.  He\r\nresorted to the same tribunal to set him right in regard to his\r\napparent defeat at Chelmsford, in 1856.  Next year he presented the\r\nram beaten there to the Salisbury meeting, and another jury gave the\r\nanimal the highest meed of merit.\r\n\r\nIt was at the zenith of his fame as a sheep-breeder that Mr. Webb\r\n\"assisted,\" as the French say, at the Universal Exposition at Paris,\r\nin 1855.  Here his beautiful animals excited the liveliest\r\nadmiration.  The Emperor came himself to examine them, and expressed\r\nhimself highly pleased at their splendid qualities.  It was on this\r\noccasion that Mr. Webb presented to the Emperor his prize ram, for\r\nwhich, probably, he had refused the largest sum ever offered for a\r\nsingle animal of the same race, or 500 guineas ($2,500).  The\r\nEmperor accepted the noble present, fully appreciating the spirit in\r\nwhich it was offered, and some time afterwards sent the generous\r\nbreeder a magnificent candelabra, of solid silver, representing a\r\ngrand, old English oak, with a group of horses shading themselves\r\nunder its branches.  This splendid token of the Emperor's regard is\r\nonly one of the numerous trophies and souvenirs that embellish the\r\nfarmer's home at Babraham, and which his children and remoter\r\nposterity will treasure as precious heirlooms.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Webb did not originate, he developed a system of usefulness\r\ninto a permanent and most valuable institution, which, perhaps, will\r\nbe the most novel to American stock-raisers.  Having, by a long\r\ncourse of scientific observations and experiments, _fixed_ the\r\nqualities he desired to give his Southdowns; having brought them to\r\nthe highest perfection, he now adopted a system which would most\r\nwidely and cheaply diffuse the race thus cultivated all over the\r\ncivilized world.  He instituted an annual ram-letting, which took\r\nplace in the month of July.  This occasion constituted an important\r\nevent to the great agricultural world.  A few Americans have been\r\npresent and witnessed the proceedings of these memorable days, and\r\nthey know the interest attaching to them better than can be inferred\r\nfrom any description.  M. De La Trehonnais, in the \"Revue Agricole\r\nde l'Angleterre,\" thus sketches some of the incidents and aspects of\r\nthe occasion:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a proceeding regarded in England as a public event, and all\r\nthe journals give an account of it with exact care, assembling from\r\nevery county and even from foreign countries.  The sale begins about\r\ntwo o'clock.  A circle in formed with ropes in a small field near\r\nthe mansion, where the rams are introduced, and an auctioneer\r\nannounces the biddings, which are frequently very spirited.  The\r\nrams to be let are exposed around the field from the first of the\r\nmorning, and a ticket at the head of each pen indicates the weight\r\nof the fleece of the animal it contains.  Every one takes his notes,\r\nchooses the animal he approves of, and can demand the last bidding\r\nwhen he pleases.  The evening after the letting, the numerous\r\ncompany assembles under a rustic shed, ornamented with leaves and\r\nagricultural devices.  There tables are laid, around which are\r\nplaced two or three hundred guests, and then commences one of those\r\nantique repasts described by Homer or Rabelais.  The tables groan\r\nunder the enormous pieces of beef, gigantic hams, etc., which have\r\nalmost disappeared before the commencement of the sale.  From eight\r\nin the morning until two in the afternoon, tables laid out in the\r\ndining-room and hall are furnished, only to be refurnished\r\nimmediately, the end being equal to the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nThis description refers to the thirty-second letting.  Mr. Webb's\r\nflock then consisted of seven hundred breeding ewes, a proportionate\r\nnumber of lambs, and about four hundred rams of different ages.  It\r\nwas from these rams that the animals were selected which were sent\r\ninto every country in the civilized world.  The average price of\r\ntheir lettings was nearly 24 pounds each, although some of the rams\r\nbrought the sum of 180 pounds, or nearly _nine hundred dollars_!\r\nWhat would some of the old-fashioned farmers of New England, of\r\nforty years ago, think of paying nearly a thousand dollars for the\r\nrent of a ram for a single year, or even one-tenth of that sum?  But\r\nthis rentage was not a fancy price.  The farmer who paid it got back\r\nhis money many times over in the course of a few years.  From this\r\ninfusion of the Babraham blood into his flock, he realised an\r\naugmented production of mutton and wool annually per acre which he\r\ncould count definitely by pounds.  The verdict of his balance-sheet\r\nproved the profit of the investment.  It would be impossible to\r\nmeasure the benefit which the whole world reaped from Mr. Webb's\r\nlabors in this department of usefulness.  An eminent authority has\r\nstated that \"it would be difficult, if not impossible, to find a\r\nSouthdown flock of any reputation, in any country in the world, not\r\nclosely allied with the Babraham flock.\"  It is a fact that\r\nillustrates the skill and care, as well as demonstrates the value of\r\nhis system of improvement, that, after thirty-seven years as a\r\nbreeder, the tribes he founded maintained to the last those\r\ndistinguishing qualities which gave them such pre-eminence over all\r\nother sheep bearing the general name of the Sussex race.  So\r\nvaluable and distinctive were these qualities regarded by the best\r\njudges in the country, that the twelfth ram-letting, which took\r\nplace at the time of the Cambridge Show, brought together 2,000\r\nvisitors, constituting, perhaps, the most distinguished assembly of\r\nagriculturists ever convened.  On this occasion the Duke of\r\nRichmond, an hereditary and eminent breeder of Southdowns in their\r\nnative county, bid a hundred guineas for a ram lamb, which Mr. Webb\r\nhimself bought in.\r\n\r\nHaving attained to such eminence as a sheep-breeder, Mr. Webb\r\nentered upon another sphere of improvement, in which he won almost\r\nequal distinction.  In 1837, he laid the foundation of the Babraham\r\nHerd of Shorthorn cattle, made up of six different tribes, purchased\r\nfrom the most valuable and celebrated branches of the race bearing\r\nthat name.  An incident attaching to one of these purchases may\r\nillustrate the nice care and cultivated skill which Mr. Webb\r\nexercised in the treatment of choice animals.  He bought out of Lord\r\nSpencer's herd the celebrated cow, \"Dodona.\"  That eminent breeder,\r\nit appears, had given her up as irretrievably sterile, and he parted\r\nwith her solely on that account.  Mr. Webb, however, took her to\r\nBabraham, and, as a result of the more intelligent treatment he\r\nbestowed upon her, she produced successively four calves, which thus\r\nformed one of the most valuable families of the Babraham herd.  When\r\nI visited the scene of his life and labors, all his sheep and cattle\r\nhad been sold.  But two or three animals bought by an Australian\r\ngentleman were still in the keeping of Mr. Webb's son, awaiting\r\narrangements for their transportation.  One of these, a beautiful\r\nheifer of fourteen months, was purchased at the winding-up sale, for\r\n225 guineas.  It was called the \"Drawing-room Rose,\" from this\r\ncircumstance, as I afterwards learned.  When it was first dropped by\r\nthe dam, Mr. Webb was confined to the house by indisposition.  But\r\nhe had such a desire to see this new accession to his bovine family,\r\nthat he directed it to be brought into the drawing-room for that\r\npurpose.  Hence it received a more elegant and domestic appellation\r\nthan the variegated nomenclature of high-blooded animals often\r\nallows.\r\n\r\nWhen the last volume of the \"English Herd-Book\" was about to be\r\npublished, Mr. Webb sent for insertion a list of sixty-one cows,\r\nwith their products.  He generally kept from twenty to thirty bulls\r\nin his stalls.\r\n\r\nNor were his labors confined even to the two great spheres of\r\nenterprise with which his name has been intimately and honorably\r\nassociated.  If it was the great aim of his intelligent activities\r\nto produce stock which should yield the most meat to the acre, he\r\nalso gave great attention to the augmented production of the land\r\nitself.  He was the principal originator and promoter of the great\r\nAgricultural Hall, in London, for the exhibition of the fat stock\r\nfor the Smithfield Show.  This may be called the Crystal Palace of\r\nthe animal world.  It is the grandest structure ever erected for the\r\nexhibition of cattle, sheep, swine, poultry, etc.  I will essay no\r\ndescription of it here, but it will carry through long generations\r\nthe name and memory of Jonas Webb of Babraham.  He was chairman of\r\nthe company that built the superb edifice; also president of the\r\nNitro-phosphate or Blood-manure Company, a fertilizer in which he\r\nhad the greatest confidence, and which he used in great quantities\r\nupon the large farm he cultivated, containing over 2,000 acres.\r\n\r\nAt the age of nearly sixty-six, Mr. Webb found that his health would\r\nno longer stand the strain of the toil, care, and anxiety requisite\r\nto keep up the Babraham flock to the high standard of perfection\r\nwhich it had attained.  So, after nearly forty years of devotion to\r\nthis great occupation of his life, he concluded to retire from it\r\naltogether, dispersing his sheep and cattle as widely as purchasers\r\nmight be found.  This breaking-up took place at Babraham on the 10th\r\nof July, 1862.  Then and there the long series of annual re-unions\r\nterminated for ever.  The occasion had a mournful interest to many\r\nwho had attended those meetings from year to year.  It seemed like\r\nthe voluntary and unexpected abdication of an Alexander, still able\r\nto add to his conquests and trophies.  All present felt this; and\r\nseveral tried to express it at the old table now spread for the last\r\ntime for such guests.  But his inherent and invincible modesty\r\nwaived aside or intercepted the compliments that came from so many\r\nlips.  With a kind of ingenious delicacy, which one of the finest of\r\nhuman sentiments could only inspire, he contrived to divert\r\nattention or reference to himself and his life's labors.  But he\r\ncould not make the company forget them, even if he gently checked\r\nallusion to them.\r\n\r\nThe company on this interesting occasion was very large, about 1,000\r\npersons having sat down to the collation.  Not only were the\r\nprincipal nobility and gentry of Great Britain interested in\r\nagricultural pursuits present in large number, but the\r\nrepresentatives of nearly every other country in Christendom.\r\nSeveral gentlemen from the United States were among the purchasers.\r\nThe total number of sheep sold was 969, which fetched under the\r\nhammer the great aggregate of 10,926 pounds, or more than $54,000.\r\nThe most splendid ram in the flock went to the United States, being\r\nknocked down to Mr. J. C. Taylor, of Holmdale, New Jersey; who is\r\ndoing so much to Americanise the Southdowns.  Others went to the\r\nCanadas, Australia, South America, and to nearly every country in\r\ncontinental Europe.\r\n\r\nThus was formed, and thus was dispersed the famous Babraham flock.\r\nAnd such were the labors of Jonas Webb for the material well-being\r\nof mankind.  These alone, detached from those qualities and\r\ncharacteristics which make up and reflect a higher nature, entitle\r\nhis name to a wide and lasting memory among men.  And these labors\r\nand successes are they that those who have read of them in different\r\ncountries know him by.  These comprise and present the character\r\nthey honor with respect.  What he was in the temper and disposition\r\nof his inner life, in daily walk and conversation, in the even and\r\ngentle amenities of Christian humility, in sudden trials of his\r\nfaith and patience; what he was as a husband, father, friend and\r\nneighbor, to the poor, to the afflicted in mind, body or estate,--\r\nall this will remain unwritten, but not unremembered by those who\r\nbreathed and moved within that disk of light which his life shed\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nFew men have lived in whom so many personal and moral qualities\r\ncombined to command respect, esteem, and even admiration.  In\r\nstature, countenance, expression, and deportment, he was a noble\r\nspecimen of fully developed English manhood.  To this first,\r\nexternal aspect, his kindly and generous dispositions, his genial\r\nmanners, his delicate but dignified modesty, his large intelligence\r\nand large-heartedness, gave the additional and crowning\r\ncharacteristic of a Christian gentleman.  Many Americans have\r\nvisited Babraham, and enjoyed the hospitalities which such a host\r\ncould only give and grace.  They will remember the paintings hung\r\naround the walls of that drawing-room, in which his commanding form,\r\nin the strength and beauty of meridian life, towers up in the rural\r\nlandscape, surrounded by cattle and sheep bearing the impress of his\r\nskill and care.  A little incident occurred a few years ago, which\r\nmay illustrate this personal aspect better than any simile of\r\ndescription.  On the occasion of one of the great Agricultural\r\nExpositions in Paris, a deputation or a company of gentlemen went\r\nover to represent the Agricultural Society of England.  Mr. Webb was\r\none of the number; and some French nobleman who had known him\r\npersonally, as well as by reputation, was very desirous of making\r\nhim a guest while in Paris.  To be sure of this pleasure, he sent a\r\nspecial courier all the way to Folkestone, charged with a letter\r\nwhich he was himself to put into the hands of Mr. Webb, before the\r\nsteamer left the dock.  \"But how am I to know the gentleman?\" asked\r\nthe courier; \"I never saw him in my life.\"  \"N'importe,\" was the\r\nreply.  \"Put the letter in the hand of the noblest-looking man on\r\nboard, and you will be sure to be right.\"  The courier followed the\r\ndirection; and, stationing himself near the gangway, he took his\r\nmaster's measure of every passenger as he entered.  He could not be\r\nmistaken.  As soon as the plank was withdrawn, he approached Mr.\r\nWebb, hat in hand, and, with a deferential word of recognition, done\r\nin the best grace of French politeness, handed him the letter.  One\r\nof the deputation, noticing the incident, and wondering how the man\r\nknew whom he was addressing without previous inquiry, questioned him\r\nafterwards on the subject, and learned from him the ground on which\r\nhe proceeded.  The photographic likeness presented in connection\r\nwith this notice was taken shortly before his decease, at the age of\r\nnearly sixty-six, and when his health was greatly impaired.\r\n\r\nFew men ever carried out so fully the injunction, not to let the\r\nleft hand know what the right hand did, in the quiet and steady\r\noutflow of good will and good works, as Mr. Webb.  Even those\r\nnearest and dearest to him never knew what that right hand did as a\r\nhelp in time of need, what that large heart felt in time of others'\r\naffliction, what those lips said to the sorrowing, in tearful\r\nmoments of grief, until they had been stilled for ever on earth.\r\nThen it came out, act by act, word by word, thought by thought, from\r\nthose who held the remembrances in their souls as precious souvenirs\r\nof a good man's life.  So earnest was his desire to do these things\r\nin secret, that his own family heard of them only by accident, and\r\nfrom those whom he so greatly helped with his kindness and\r\ngenerosity.  And when known by his wife and children, in this way,\r\nthey were put under the bann of secrecy.  This it is that makes it\r\nso difficult to delineate the home and heaven side of his character.\r\nThose nearest to him, who breathed in the blessing of its daily\r\nodor, so revere his repeated and earnest wish not to have his good\r\nworks talked of in public, that, even now he is dead and gone, they\r\nhold it as a sacred obligation to his memory not to give up these\r\ntreasured secrets of his life.  Thus, in giving a partial coup\r\nd'oeil of that aspect of his character which fronted homeward and\r\nheavenward, one can only glean, here and there, glimpses of\r\ndifferent traits, in acts, incidents, and anecdotes remembered by\r\nneighbors and friends near and remote.  Were it not that his\r\nchildren are withheld, by this delicate veneration, from giving to\r\nthe public facts known to them alone, the moral beauty and\r\nbrightness of his life would shine out upon the outside world with\r\nwarmer rays and larger rayons.  I hope that a single passage from a\r\nletter written by one of them to a friend, even under the injunction\r\nof confidence, may be given here, without rending the veil which\r\nthey hold so sacred.  In referring to this disposition and habit of\r\nher venerated father, she says--\r\n\r\n\"Often have I been so blessed as to be caused to shed tears of joy\r\nand pride at hearing proofs of his tenderness, kindness, and\r\ngenerosity related by the recipients of some token of his nobleness,\r\nbut of which we never should have heard from himself.\"\r\n\r\nA little incident may illustrate this trait of his disposition.  In\r\n1862, a \"Loan Court\" was held in London, at which there was a most\r\nmagnificent display of jewels and plate of all kinds, contributed by\r\ntheir owners to be exhibited for the gratification of the public.  A\r\nfriend, who held him in the highest veneration, returning from this\r\nbrilliant show, expressed regret that Mr. Webb had not furnished one\r\nof the stands, by sending the splendid silver candelabra presented\r\nto him by the French Emperor, with the many silver cups and medals\r\nhe had won.  Mr. Webb replied, that the mercies God had blessed him\r\nwith, and the successes He had awarded to him, might have been sent\r\nto teach him humility, and not given to parade before the world.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most striking proofs of his great and pure-\r\nheartedness, that, notwithstanding nearly forty consecutive years of\r\nvigorous and successful competition with the leading agriculturists\r\nof Great Britain and other countries, none of the victories he won\r\nover them, or the eminence he attained, ever made him an enemy.\r\nWhen we consider the eager ambitions and excited sensibilities that\r\nenter into these competitions, this fact in itself shows what manner\r\nof man he was in his disposition and deportment.  Referring to this\r\naspect of his character, the French writer already cited, M. De La\r\nTrehonnais, says of him, while still living--\r\n\r\n\"There exists no person who has gained the esteem and goodwill of\r\nhis contemporaries to a higher degree than Mr. Webb.  His probity,\r\nhis scrupulous good faith, his generosity, and the affable equality\r\nof his character, have gained for him the respect and affection of\r\nevery one.  Since I have had the honor of knowing him, which is\r\nalready many years, I have never known of his having a single enemy;\r\nand in my constant intercourse with the agricultural classes of\r\nEngland, I have never heard of a single malevolent insinuation\r\nrespecting him.  When we consider how much those who raise\r\nthemselves in the world above others, are made the butt for the\r\nattacks of envy in proportion with their elevation, we may conclude\r\nthat there are in the character of this wealthy man very solid\r\nvirtues, well fixed principles, transcendant [sic] merit, to have\r\npassed through his long career of success and triumphs without\r\nhaving drawn upon himself the ill-will of a single enemy, or the\r\ncalumnious shaft of envy.\"\r\n\r\nNor were these negative virtues, ending where they begun, or\r\nenabling him to go through a long life of energetic activities\r\nwithout an enemy.  He not only lived at peace with all men, but did\r\nhis utmost to make them live at peace with each other.  Says one who\r\nknew him intimately--\"I never heard him express a sentiment savoring\r\nof enmity to any person, nor could he bear to see it entertained by\r\nany one towards another.  Even if he heard of an ill-feeling\r\nexisting between persons, he would, if possible, effect a\r\nreconciliation; and his own bright example, and hearty, kind, genial\r\nmanners always warmed all hearts towards himself.  Notwithstanding\r\nthe numerous calls upon his time, made by public and private\r\nbusiness, he did not lose his sweet cheerfulness of temper, and was\r\never ready in his most busy moments to aid others, if he saw a\r\npossibility of so doing.\"  Energy, gentleness, conscientiousness and\r\ncourtesy were seldom, if ever, blended in such suave accord as in\r\nhim.  These virtues came out, each in its distinctive lustre, under\r\nthe trials and vexations which try human nature most severely.  All\r\nwho knew him marvelled that he was able to maintain such sweetness\r\nand evenness of temper under provocations and difficulties which\r\nwould have greatly annoyed most men.  What he was in these outer\r\ncircles of his influence, he was, to all the centralization of his\r\nvirtues, in the heart of his family.  Here, indeed, the best graces\r\nof his character had their full play and beauty.  He was the centre\r\nand soul of one of the happiest of earthly homes, attracting to him\r\nthe affections of every member of the hearth circle that moved in\r\nthe sleepless light of his life.  Here he did not rule, but led by\r\nlove.  It alone dictated, and it alone obeyed.  It inspired its like\r\nin domestic discipline.  Spontaneous reverence for such a father's\r\nwish and will superseded the unpleasant necessity of more active\r\nparental constraint.  To bring a shade of sadness to that venerated\r\nface, or a speechless reproach to that benignant eye, was a greater\r\npunishment to a temporarily wayward child than any corporal\r\ncorrection could have inflicted.\r\n\r\nNo one of the hundreds that were present at the sale and dispersion\r\nof the Babraham flock could have thought that the remaining days of\r\nthe great and good man were to be so few on earth.  He was then\r\nabout sixty-five years of age, of stately, unbending form and face\r\nradiant and genial with the florid flush of that Indian Summer which\r\nso many Englishmen wear late in those autumnal years that bend and\r\npale American forms and faces to \"the sere and yellow leaf\" of life.\r\nBut the sequel proved that he did not abdicate his position too\r\nearly.  In a little more than a year from this event, his spirit was\r\nraised to higher fellowships and folded with those of the pure and\r\nblest of bygone ages.  The incidents and coincidents of the last,\r\ngreat moments of his being here, were remarkable and affecting.\r\nNeither he nor his wife died at the home they had made so happy with\r\nthe beauty and savor of their virtues.  Under another and distant\r\nroof they both laid themselves down to die.  The husband's hand was\r\nlinked in his wife's, up to within a few short steps of the river's\r\nbrink, when, touched with the cold spray of the dark waters, it fell\r\nfrom its hold and was superseded by the strong arm of the angel of\r\nthe covenant, sent to bear her fast across the flood.  In life they\r\nwere united to a oneness seldom witnessed on earth; in death they\r\nwere not separated except by the thinnest partition.  Though her\r\nspirit was taken up first to the great and holy communion above, the\r\n\"ministering angel of God's love let her body remain with him as a\r\npledge until his own spirit was called to join hers in the joint\r\nmansion of their eternal rest.  On the very day that her body was\r\ncarried to its long home, his own unloosed, to its upward flight,\r\nthe soul that had made it shine for half a century like a temple\r\nerected to the Divine Glory.  The years allotted to him on earth\r\nwere even to a day.  Just sixty-six were measured off to him, and\r\nthen \"the wheel ceased to turn at the cistern,\" and he died on his\r\nbirthday.  An affecting coincidence also marked the departure of his\r\nbeloved wife.  She left on the birthday of her eldest son, who had\r\nintended to make the anniversary the dating-day of domestic\r\nhappiness, by choosing it for his marriage.\r\n\r\nA few facts will suffice for the history of the closing scene.\r\nAbout the middle of October, 1862, Mrs. Webb, whose health seemed\r\nfailing, went to visit her brother, Henry Marshall, Esq., residing\r\nin Cambridge.  Here she suddenly became much worse, and the prospect\r\nof her recovery more and more doubtful.  Mr. Webb was with her\r\nimmediately on the first unfavorable turn of her illness, together\r\nwith other members of the family.  When he realised her danger, and\r\nthe hope of her surviving broke down within him, his physical\r\nconstitution succumbed under the impending blow, and two days before\r\nher death, he was prostrated by a nervous fever, from which he never\r\nrallied, but died on the 10th of November.  Although the great\r\nvisitation was too heavy for his flesh and blood to bear, his spirit\r\nwas strengthened to drink this last cup of earthly trial with\r\nbeautiful serenity and submission.  It was strong enough to make his\r\nquivering lips to say, in distinct and audible utterance, and his\r\nclosing eyes to pledge the truth and depth of the sentiment, \"Thy\r\nwill be done!\"  One who stood over him in these last moments says,\r\nthat, when assured of his own danger, his countenance only seemed to\r\ntake on a light of greater happiness.  He was conscious up to within\r\na few minutes of his death, and, though unable to speak\r\narticulately, responded by expressions of his countenance to the\r\nwords and looks of affection addressed to him by the dear ones\r\nsurrounding his bed.  One of them read to him a favorite hymn,\r\nbeginning with \"Cling to the Comforter!\"  When she ceased, he signed\r\nto her to repeat it; and, while the words were still on her lips,\r\nthe Comforter came at his call, and bore his waiting spirit away to\r\nthe heavenly companionship for which it longed.  As it left the\r\nstilled temple of its earthly habitation, it shed upon the\r\ndelicately-carved lines of its marble door and closed windows a\r\nsweet gleam of the morning twilight of its own happy immortality.\r\n\r\nA long funeral cortege attended the remains of the deceased from\r\nCambridge to their last resting place in the little village\r\nchurchyard of Babraham.  Beside friends from neighboring villages,\r\nthe First Cambridgeshire Mounted Rifle Corps joined the procession,\r\ntogether with a large number of the county police force.  His body\r\nwas laid down to its last, long rest beside that of his wife, who\r\npreceded him to the tomb only by a few days.  Though Stratford-upon-\r\nAvon, and Dryburgh Abbey may attract more American travellers to\r\ntheir shrines, I am sure many of them, with due perception of moral\r\nworth, will visit Babraham, and hold it in reverent estimation as\r\nthe home of one of the world's best worthies, who left on it a\r\nbiograph which shall have a place among the human-life-scapes which\r\nthe Saviour of mankind shall hang up in the inner temple of His\r\nFather's glory, as the most precious tokens and trophies of the\r\nearth, on which He shared the tearful experiences of humanity, and\r\nbore back to His throne all the touching memories of its weaknesses,\r\ngriefs, and sorrows.\r\n\r\nA movement is now on foot to erect a suitable monument to his\r\nmemory.  It may indicate the public estimation in which his life and\r\nlabors are held that, already, about 10,000 pounds have been\r\nsubscribed towards this testimonial to his worth.  The monument,\r\ndoubtless, will be placed in the great Agricultural Hall, which he\r\ndid so much to found.  His name will wear down to coming generations\r\nthe crystal roofage of that magnificent edifice as a fitting crown\r\nof honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRESHING MACHINE--FLOWER SHOW--THE HOLLYHOCK AND ITS SUGGESTIONS--\r\nTHE LAW OF CO-OPERATIVE ACTIVITIES IN VEGETABLE, ANIMAL, MENTAL, AND\r\nMORAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n     \"In all places, then, and in all seasons,\r\n      Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings,\r\n      Teaching us, by most persuasive reasons,\r\n      How akin they are to human things.\"--LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nMy stay at Babraham was short.  It was like a visit to the grave of\r\none of those English worthies whose lives and labors are so well\r\nknown and appreciated in America.  All the external features of the\r\nestablishment were there unchanged.  The large and substantial\r\nmansion, with its hall and parlor walls hung with the mementoes of\r\nthe genius and success that had made it so celebrated; the barns and\r\nhousings for the great herds and flocks which had been dispersed\r\nover the world; the very pens still standing in which they had been\r\nfolded in for the auctioneer's hammer; all these arrangements and\r\naspects remained as they were when Jonas Webb left his home to\r\nreturn no more.  But all those beautiful and happy families of\r\nanimal life, which he reared to such perfection, were scattered on\r\nthe wings of wind and steam to the uttermost and most opposite parts\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son, Mr. Samuel Webb, who supervises part of the farm\r\noccupied by his father, and also carries on one of his own in a\r\nneighboring parish, was very cordial and courteous, and drove me to\r\nhis establishment near Chesterford.  Here a steam threshing machine\r\nwas at work, doing prodigious execution on different kinds of grain.\r\nThe engine had climbed, a proprii motu, a long ascent; had made its\r\nway partly through ploughed land to the rear of the barn, and was\r\nrattlingly busy in a fog of dust, doing the labor of a hundred\r\nflails.  Ricks of wheat and beans, each as large as a comfortable\r\ncottage, disappeared in quick succession through the fingers of the\r\nchattering, iron-ribbed giant, and came out in thick and rapid\r\nstreams of yellow grain.  Swine seemed to be the speciality to which\r\nthis son of Mr. Webb is giving some of that attention which his\r\nfather gave to sheep.  There were between 200 and 300 in the barn-\r\nyards and pens, of different ages and breeds, all looking in\r\nexcellent condition.\r\n\r\nFrom Chesterford I went on to Cambridge, where I remained for the\r\nmost part of two days, on account of a heavy fall of rain, which\r\nkept me within doors nearly all the time.  I went out, however, for\r\nan hour or so to see a Flower Show in the Town Hall.  The varieties\r\nand specimens made a beautiful, but not very extensive array.  There\r\nwas one flower that not only attracted especial admiration, but\r\ninvited a pleasant train of thoughts to my own mind.  It was one of\r\nthose old favorites to which the common people of all countries, who\r\nspeak our mother tongue, love to give an inalienable English name--\r\nThe Hollyhock.  It is one of the flowers of the people, which the\r\npedantic Latinists have left untouched in homely Saxon, because the\r\npeople would have none of their long-winded and heartless\r\nappellations.  Having dwelt briefly upon the honor that Divine\r\nProvidence confers upon human genius and labor, in letting them\r\nimpress their finger-marks so distinctly upon the features and\r\nfunctions of the earth, and upon the forms of animal life, it may be\r\na profitable recurrence to the same line of thought to notice what\r\nthat same genius and labor have wrought upon the structure and face\r\nof this familiar flower.  What was it at first?  What is it now in\r\nthe rural gardens of New England?  A shallow, bell-mouthed cup, in\r\nmost cases purely white, and hung to a tall, coarse stalk, like the\r\nyellow jets of a mullein.  That is its natural and distinctive\r\ncharacteristic in all countries; at least where it is best known and\r\nmost common.  What is it here, bearing the fingerprints of man's\r\nmind and taste upon it?  Its white and thin-sided cup is brim full\r\nand running over with flowery exuberance of leaf and tint infinitely\r\nvariegated.  Here it is as solid, as globe-faced, and nearly as\r\nlarge as the dahlia.  Place it side by side with the old, single-\r\nleafed hollyhock, in a New England farmer's garden, and his wife\r\nwould not be able to trace any family relationship between them,\r\neven through the spectacles with which she reads the Bible.  But the\r\ndahlia itself--what was that in its first estate, in the country in\r\nwhich it was first found in its aboriginal structure and complexion?\r\nAs plain and unpretending as the hollyhock; as thinly dressed as the\r\nshort-kirtled daisy in a Connecticut meadow.  It is wonderful, and\r\npassing wonder, how teachable and quick of perception and prehension\r\nis Nature in the studio of Art.  She, the oldest of painters, that\r\nhung the earth, sea, and sky of the antediluvian world with\r\nlandscapes, waterscapes, and cloudscapes manifold and beautiful,\r\nwhen as yet the human hand had never lifted a pencil to imitate her\r\nskill; she, with the colors wherewith she dyed the fleecy clouds\r\nthat spread their purple drapery over the first sunset, and in which\r\nshe dipped the first rainbow hung in heaven, and the first rose that\r\nbreathed and blushed on earth; she that has embellished every day,\r\nsince the Sun first opened its eye upon the world, with a new\r\ngallery of paintings for every square mile of land and sea, and new\r\ndissolving views for every hour--she, with all these artistic\r\nantecedents, tastes, and faculties, comes modestly into the\r\nconservatory of the floriculturist, and takes lessons of him in\r\nshaping and tinting plants and flowers which the Great Master said\r\nwere \"all very good\" on the sixth-day morning of the creation!  This\r\nis marvellous, showing a prerogative in human genius almost divine,\r\nand worthy of reverent and grateful admiration.  How wide-reaching\r\nand multigerent is this prerogative!  In how many spheres of action\r\nit works simultaneously in these latter days!  See how it\r\nmanipulates the brute forces of Nature!  See how it saddles the\r\nwinds, and bridles and spurs the lightning!  See how it harnesses\r\nsteam to the plough, the flood to the spindle, the quick cross\r\ncurrents of electricity to the newsman's phaeton!  Then ascend to\r\nhigher reaches of its faculty.  In the hands of a Bakewell or Webb,\r\nit gives a new and creative shaping to multitudinous generations of\r\nanimal life.  Nature yields to its suggestion and leading, and co-\r\nworks, with all her best and busiest activities, to realise the\r\nhuman ideal; to put muscle there, to straighten that vertebra, to\r\nparallel more perfectly those dorsal and ventral lines, to lengthen\r\nor shorten those bones; to flesh the leg only to such a joint, and\r\nwool or unwool it below; to horn or unhorn the head, to blacken or\r\nblanch the face, to put on the whole body a new dress and make it\r\nand its remote posterity wear this new form and costume for\r\nevermore.  All this shows how kindly and how proudly Nature takes\r\nArt into partnership with her, in these new structures of beauty and\r\nperfection; both teaching and taught, and wooing man to work with\r\nher, and walk with her, and talk with her within the domain of\r\ncreative energies; to make the cattle and sheep of ten thousand\r\nhills and valleys thank the Lord, out of the grateful speech of\r\ntheir large, lustrous eyes, for better forms and features, and\r\nfaculties of comfort than their early predecessors were born to.\r\n\r\nEqually wonderful, perhaps more beautiful, is the joint work of\r\nNature and Art on the sweet life and glory of flowers.  However many\r\nthey were, and what they were, that breathed upon the first Spring\r\nor Summer day of time, each was a half-sealed gift of God to man, to\r\nbe opened by his hand when his mind should open to a new sense of\r\nbeauty and perfection.  Flowers, each with a genealogy reaching\r\nunbroken through the Flood back to the overhanging blossoms of Eden,\r\nhave come down to us, as it were, only in their travelling costume,\r\nwith their best dresses packed away in stamen, or petal, or private\r\nseedcase, to be brought out at the end of fifty centuries at the\r\ntouch of human genius.  Those of which Solomon sang in his time, and\r\nwhich exceeded his glory in their every-day array, even \"the hyssop\r\nby the wall,\" never showed, on the gala-days of his Egyptian bride,\r\nthe hidden charms which he, in his wisdom, knew not how to unlock.\r\nFlowers innumerable are now, like illuminated capitals of Nature's\r\nalphabet, flecking, with their sheen-dots, prairie, steppe, mountain\r\nand meadow, the earth around, which, perhaps, will only give their\r\nbest beauties to the world in a distant age.  As the light of the\r\nlatest-created and remotest stars has not yet completed its downward\r\njourney to the eye of man, so to his sight have not these sweet-\r\nbreathing constellations of the field yet made the full revelation\r\nof their treasured hues and forms.  Not one in a hundred of them all\r\nhas done this up to the present moment.  When one in ten of those\r\nthat bless us with their life and being shall put on all its\r\nreserved beauty, then, indeed, the stars above and the stars below\r\nwill stud the firmaments in which they shine with equal glory, and\r\nblend both in one great heaven-scape for the eye and heart of man.\r\nOne by one, in its turn, the key of human genius shall unlock the\r\nhidden wardrobe of the commonest flowers, and deck them out in the\r\ncourt dress reserved, for five thousand years, to be worn in the\r\nbrighter, afternoon centuries of the world.  The Mistress of the\r\nRobes is a high dignitary in the Household of Royalty, and has her\r\nplace near to the person of the Queen.  But the Floriculturist, of\r\neducated perception and taste, is the master of a higher state robe,\r\nand holds the key of embroidered vestments, cosmetics, tintings,\r\nartistries, hair-jewels, head-dresses, brooches, and bracelets,\r\nwhich no empress ever wore since human crowns were made; which\r\nNature herself could not show on all the bygone birthdays of her\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThis is marvellous.  It is an honor to man, put upon him from above,\r\nas one of the gratuitous dignities of his being.  \"An undevout\r\nastronomer is mad,\" said one who had opened his mind to a broad\r\ngrasp of the wonders which this upper heaven holds in its bosom.\r\nThe floriculturist is an astronomer, with Newton's telescope\r\nreversed; and if its revelations do not stir up holy thoughts in his\r\nsoul, he is blind as well as mad.  No glass, no geometry that Newton\r\never lifted at the still star-worlds above, could do more than\r\n_reveal_.  At the farthest stretch of their faculty, they could only\r\nbring to light the life and immortality of those orbs which the\r\nhuman eye had never seen before.  They could not tint nor add a ray\r\nto one of them all.  They never could bring down to the reach of\r\nman's unaided vision a single star that Noah could not see through\r\nthe deck-lights of the ark.  It was a gift and a glory that well\r\nrewarded the science and genius of Newton and Herschel, of Adams and\r\nLe Verrier, that they could ladder these mighty perpendicular\r\ndistances and climb the rounds to such heights and sweeps of\r\nobservation, and count, measure, and name orbs and orbits before\r\nunknown, and chart the paths of their rotations and weigh them, as\r\nin scales, while in motion.  But this ge-astronomer, whose\r\nobservatory is his conservatory, whose telescope and fluxions are\r\nhis trowel and watering-pot, not only brings to light the hidden\r\nlife of a thousand earth-stars, but changes their forms, colors\r\ntheir rays, half creates and transforms, until each differs as much\r\nfrom its original structure and tinting as the planet Jupiter would\r\ndiffer from its familiar countenance if Adams or Le Verrier could\r\nmake it wear the florid face of Mars.  This man,--and it is to be\r\nhoped he carries some devout and grateful thoughts to his work--sets\r\nNature new lessons daily in artistry, and she works out the new\r\nideals of his taste to their joint and equal admiration.  He has got\r\nup a new pattern for the fern.  She lets him guide her hand in the\r\ndelicate operation, and she crimps, fringes, shades or shapes its\r\nleaflets to his will, even to a thousand varieties.  He moistens her\r\nfingers with the fluids she uses on her easel, and puts them to the\r\nrootlets of the rose, and they transpose its hues, or fringe it or\r\ntinge it with a new glory.  He goes into the fen or forest, or\r\nclimbs the jutting crags of lava-mailed mountains, and brings back\r\nto his fold one of Nature's foundlings,--a little, pale-faced\r\norphan, crouching, pinched and starved, in a ragged hood of dirty\r\nmuslin; and he puts it under the fostering of those maternal\r\nfingers, guided by his own.  Soon it feels the inspiration of a new\r\nlife warming and swelling its shrivelled veins.  Its paralysed\r\npetals unfold, one by one.  The rim of its cup fills, leaf by leaf,\r\nto the brim.  It becomes a thing most lovely and fair, and he\r\nintroduces it, with pride, to the court beauties of his crystal\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturist is taken into this co-partnership of Nature in a\r\nhigher domain of her activities, measured by the great utilities of\r\nhuman life.  We have glanced at the joint-work in her animal\r\nkingdom.  In the vegetable, it is equally wonderful.  Nature\r\ncontributes the raw material of these great and vital industries,\r\nthen incites and works out human suggestions.  Thus she trains and\r\nobeys the mind and hand of man, in this grand sphere of development.\r\nTheir co-working and its result are just as perceptible in a common\r\nIrish potato as in the most gorgeous dahlia ever exhibited.  Not one\r\nfarmer in a thousand has ever read the history of that root of\r\nroots, in value to mankind; has ever conceived what a tasteless,\r\ncontracted, water-soaked thing it was in its wild and original\r\ncondition.  Let them read a few chapters of the early history of New\r\nEngland, and they will see what it was two hundred and fifty years\r\nago, when the strong-hearted men and women, whom Hooker led to the\r\nbanks of the Connecticut, sought for it in the white woods of\r\nwinter, scraping away the snow with their frosted fingers.  The\r\nlargest they found just equalled the Malaga grape in size and\r\nresembled it in complexion.  They called it the _ground-nut_, for it\r\nseemed akin to the nuts dropped by the oaks of different names.  No\r\nflower that breathes on earth has been made to produce so many\r\nvarieties of form, complexion, and name as this homely root.  It\r\nwould be an interesting and instructive enterprise, to array all the\r\nvarieties of this queen of esculent vegetables which Europe and\r\nAmerica could exhibit, face to face with all the varieties which the\r\ndahlia, geranium, pansy, or even the fern has produced, and then see\r\nwhich has been numerically the most prolific in diversification of\r\nforms and features.  It should gratify a better motive than\r\ncuriosity to trace back the history of other roots to their\r\naboriginal condition.  Types of the original stock may now be found,\r\nin waste places, in the wild turnip, wild carrot, parsnip, etc.\r\n\"Line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a\r\nlittle,\" it may be truly and gratefully said, these roots,\r\ninternetted with the very life-fibres of human sustenance, have been\r\nbrought to their present perfection and value.  The great\r\ngovernments and peoples of the world should give admiring and\r\ngrateful thought to this fact.  Here nature co-works with the most\r\ncommon and inartistic of human industries, as they are generally\r\nheld, with faculties as subtle and beautiful as those which she\r\nbrings to bear upon the choicest flowers.  The same is true of\r\ngrains and grasses for man and beast.  They come down to us from a\r\nkind of heathen parentage, receiving new forms and qualities from\r\nage to age.  The wheats, which make the bread of all the continents,\r\nnow exhibit varieties which no one has undertaken to enumerate.\r\nFruits follow the same rule, and show the same joint-working of\r\nNature and Art as in the realm of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe wheel within wheel, the circle within circle expand and ascend\r\nuntil the last circumferential line sweeps around all the world of\r\ncreated being, even taking in, upon the common radius, the highest\r\nand oldest of the angels.  From the primrose peering from the hedge\r\nto the premier seraph wearing the coronet of his sublime\r\ncompanionship; from the lowest forms of vegetable existence to the\r\nloftiest reaches of moral nature this side of the Infinite, this\r\neverlasting law of co-working rules the ratio of progress and\r\ndevelopment.  In all the concentric spheres strung on the radius\r\nmeasured by these extremes, there is the same co-acting of internal\r\nand external forces.  And mind, of man or angel, guides and governs\r\nboth.  Not a flower that ever breathed on earth, not one that ever\r\nblushed in Eden, could open all its hidden treasures of beauty\r\nwithout the co-working of man's mind and taste.  No animal that ever\r\nbowed its neck to his yoke, or gave him labor, milk or wool, could\r\ncome to the full development of its latent vitalities and symmetries\r\nwithout the help of his thought and skill.  The same law obtains in\r\nhis own physical nature.  Mind has made it what it is to-day, as\r\ncompared with the wild features and habits of its aboriginal\r\ncondition.  Mind has worked for five thousand years upon its fellow-\r\ntraveller through time, to fit it more and more fully for the\r\ncompanionship.  It was delivered over to her charge naked, with its\r\nattributes and faculties as latent and dormant as those of the wild\r\nrose or dahlia.  Through all the ages long, she has worked upon its\r\ndevelopment; educating its tastes; taming its appetites; refining\r\nits sensibilities; multiplying and softening its enjoyments; giving\r\nto every sense a new capacity and relish of delight; cultivating the\r\near for music, and ravishing it with the concord of sweet sounds;\r\ncultivating the eye to drink in the glorious beauty of the external\r\nworld, then adding to natural sceneries ten thousand pictures of\r\nmountain, valley, river, man, angel, and scenes in human and\r\nheaven's history, painted by the thought-instructed hand;\r\ncultivating the palate to the most exquisite sensibilities, and\r\nexploring all the zones for luxuries to gratify them; cultivating\r\nthe fine finger-nerves to such perception that they can feel the\r\npulse of sleeping notes of music; cultivating the still finer\r\norganism that catches the subtle odors on the wing, and sends their\r\nseparate or mingled breathings through every vein and muscle from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\nThe same law holds good in the development of mind.  It has now\r\nreached such an altitude, and it shines with such lustre, that our\r\nimagination can hardly find the way down to the morning horizon of\r\nits life, and measure its scope and power in the dim twilight of its\r\nfirst hours in time.  The simple fact of its first condition would\r\nnow seem to most men as exaggerated fancies, if given in the\r\nsimplest forms of truthful statement.  With all the mighty faculties\r\nto which it has come; with its capacity to count, name, measure and\r\nweigh stars that Adam, nor Moses, nor Solomon ever saw; with all the\r\nforces of nature it has subdued to the service of man, it cannot\r\ntell what simplest facts of the creation had to be ascertained by\r\nits first, feeble and confused reasonings.  No one of to-day can say\r\nhow low down in the scale of intelligence the human mind began to\r\nexercise its untried faculties; what apposition and deduction of\r\nthoughts it required to individualise the commonest objects that met\r\nthe eye; even to determine that the body it animated was not an\r\nimmovable part of the earth itself; to obtain fixed notions of\r\ndistance, of color, light, and heat; to learn the properties and\r\nuses of plants, herbs, and fruits; even to see the sun sink out of\r\nsight with the sure faith that it would rise again.  It was gifted\r\nwith no instinct, to decide these questions instantly and\r\nmechanically.  They had all to pass through the varied processes of\r\nreason.  The first bird that sang in Eden, built its first nest as\r\nperfectly as its last.  But, thought by thought, the first human\r\nmind worked out conclusions which the dullest beast or bird reached\r\ninstantly without reason.  What wonderful co-working of internal and\r\nexternal influences was provided to keep thought in sleepless\r\naction; to open, one by one, the myriad petals of the mind!  Nature,\r\nwith all its shifting sceneries, filled every new scope of vision\r\nwith objects that hourly set thought at play in a new line of\r\nreflection.  Then, out of man's physical being came a thousand still\r\nsmall voices daily, whispering, Think! think!  The first-born\r\nnecessities, few and simple, cried, \"_Think_! for we want bread, we\r\nwant drink, we want shelter and raiment against the cold.\"  The\r\nfiner senses cried continually, \"Give! give thought to this, to\r\nthat.\"  The Eye, the Ear, the Palate and every other organ that\r\ncould receive and diffuse delight, worked the mental faculties by\r\nday and night, up to the last sunset of the antediluvian world; and\r\nall the intellectual result of this working Noah took with him into\r\nthe ark, and gave to his sons to hand over to succeeding ages.\r\nFlowers that Eve stuck in the hair of the infant Abel are just now\r\nopening the last casket of their beauty to the favored children of\r\nour time.  This, in itself, is a marvellous instance of the law we\r\nare noticing.  But what is this to the processes of thought and\r\nobservation through which the mind of man has reached its present\r\nexpansion; through which it has developed all these sciences, arts,\r\nindustries and tastes, the literature and the intellectual life of\r\nthese bright days of humanity!  The figure is weak, and every figure\r\nwould be weak when applied to the ratio or the result of this\r\nprogression; but, at what future age of time, or of the existence\r\nbeyond time, will the mind, that has thus wrought on earth, open its\r\nlast petal, put forth no new breathing, unfold no new beauty under\r\nthe eye of the Infinite, who breathed it, as an immortal atom of His\r\nown essence, into the being of man?\r\n\r\nFollow the radius up into the next concentric circle, and we see\r\nthis law working to finer and sublimer issues in man's moral nature.\r\nWe have glanced at what the mind has done for and through his\r\nphysical faculties and being; how that being has re-acted upon the\r\nmind, and kept all its capacities at work in procuring new delight\r\nto the eye, ear, palate, and all the senses that yearned for\r\nenjoyment.  We have noticed how the inside and outside world acted\r\nupon his reasoning powers in the dawn of creation; how slowly they\r\nmastered the simplest facts and phenomena of life in and around\r\nthem, how slowly they expanded, through the intervening centuries,\r\nto their present development.  The mind is the central personage in\r\nthe trinity of man's being; linking the mortal and immortal to its\r\nlife and action; vitalising the body with intelligence, until every\r\nvein, muscle, and nerve, and function thrills and moves to the\r\nimpulse of thought; vitalising the soul with the vigorous activities\r\nof reason, giving hands as well as wings to its hopes, faiths,\r\nloves, and aspirations; giving a faculty of speech, action, and\r\ninfluence to each, and play to all the tempers and tendencies of its\r\nmoral nature.  Thus all the influences that the mind could inhale\r\nfrom the material world through man's physical being, and all it\r\ncould draw out of the depths of Divine revelation, were the dew and\r\nthe light which it was its mission to bring to the fostering,\r\ngrowth, and glory of the human soul.  These were man's means\r\nwherewith to shape it for its great destiny; these he was to bring\r\nto its training and expansion; with these he was to co-work with the\r\nInfinite Father of Spirits to fit it for His presence and\r\nfellowship, just as he co-works with Nature in developing the latent\r\nlife and faculties of the rose.  What distillations of spiritual\r\ninfluence have dropped down out of heaven, through the ages, to help\r\nonward this joint work!  What histories of human experience have\r\ncome in the other direction to the same end!--fraught with the\r\nemotions of the human heart, from the first sin and sorrow of Adam\r\nto our own griefs, hopes, and joys; and all so many lessons for the\r\ndiscipline of this high-born nature with us!\r\n\r\nAnd yet how slow and almost imperceptible has been the development\r\nof this nature!  How gently and gradually the expanding influences,\r\nhuman and divine, have been let in upon its latent faculties!  See\r\nwith what delicate fostering the petals of love, faith, and hope\r\nwere taught to open, little by little, their hidden life and\r\nbeauty,--taking Moses' history of the process.  First, one human\r\nbeing on the earth, surrounded with beasts and birds that could give\r\nhim no intelligent companionship and no fellow-feeling.  Then the\r\nbeautiful being created to meet these awakening yearnings of his\r\nnature; then the first outflow and interchange of human love.  The\r\nnarrative brings us to the next stage of the sentiment.  Sin and\r\nsorrow afflict, but unite, both hearts in the saddest experience of\r\nhumanity.  They are driven out of the Eden of their first condition,\r\nbut their very sufferings and fears re-Eden their mutual attachments\r\nin the very thorns of their troubles and sorrows.  Then another\r\nbeing, of their own flesh, heir to their changed lot, and to these\r\nattachments, is added to their companionship.  The first child's\r\nface that heaven or earth ever saw, opened its baby eyes on them and\r\nsmiled in the light of their parental love.  The history goes on.\r\nIn process of time, there is a family of families, called a\r\ncommunity, embracing hundreds of individuals connected by ties of\r\nblood so attenuated that they possess no binding influence.  Common\r\ninterests, affinities, and sentiments supply the place of family\r\nrelationship, and make laws of amity and equity for them as a\r\npopulation.  Next we have a community of communities, or a\r\ncommonwealth of these individual populations, generally called a\r\nnation.  Here is a lesson for the moral nature.  Here are thousands\r\nand tens of thousands of men who never saw each others' faces.  Will\r\nthis expanded orb of humanity revolve around the same centre as the\r\nfirst family circle, or the first independent community?  How can\r\nyou give it cohesion and harmony?  Extend the radii of family\r\nrelationship and influence to its circumference in every direction.\r\nThrone the sovereign in a parent's chair, to execute a father's\r\nlaws.  He shall treat them as children, and they each other as\r\nbrethren.  Here is a grand programme for human society.  Here is a\r\nvigorous discipline for the wayward will and temper of the human\r\nheart.  How is a man to feel and act in these new conditions?  How\r\nis he to regulate his hates and loves, his passions and appetites,\r\nto comply properly with these extended and complicated\r\nrelationships?\r\n\r\nAbout half way from Adam's day to ours, there came an utterance from\r\nMount Sinai that anticipated and answered these questions once for\r\nall, and for one and all.  In that august revelation of the Divine\r\nMind, every command of the Decalogue swung open upon the pivot of a\r\n_not_, except one; and that one referred to man's duty to man, and\r\nthe promise attached to its fulfilment was only an earthly\r\nenjoyment.  All the rest were restrictive; to curb this appetite, to\r\nbar that passion, to hedge this impulse, to check that disposition;\r\nin a word, to hold back the hand from open and positive\r\ntransgression.  Even the first, relating to His own Godhead and\r\nrequirements, was but the first of the series of negatives, a pure\r\nand simple prohibition of idolatry.  No reward of keeping this first\r\ngreat law, reaching beyond the boundary of a temporal condition, was\r\npromised at its giving out.  With the headstrong passions, lusts,\r\nappetites, and tempers of flesh and blood bridled and bitted by\r\nthese restrictions, and with no motives to obedience beyond the\r\nawards of a short life on earth, the human soul groped its way\r\nthrough twenty centuries after the Revelation of Sinai, feeling for\r\nthe immortality which was not yet revealed to it, even \"as through a\r\nglass darkly.\"  Here and there, but thinly scattered through the\r\nages, divinely illumined men caught, through the parting seams of\r\nthe veil, a transient glimpse and ray of the life to come.  Here and\r\nthere, obscurely and hesitatingly, they refer to this vision of\r\ntheir faith.  Here and there we seem to see a hope climbing up out\r\nof a good man's heart into the pathless mystery of a future\r\nexistence, and bringing back the fragment of a leaf which it\r\nbelieves must have grown on one of the trees of life immortal.\r\nMoses, Job, David, and Isaiah give us utterances that savor of this\r\nbelief; but they leave us in the dark in reference to its influence\r\nupon their lives.  We cannot glean from these incidental\r\nexpressions, whether it brought them any steady comfort, or sensibly\r\naffected their happiness.\r\n\r\nThus, for four thousand years, the soul of man dashed its wings\r\nagainst the prison-bars of time, peering into the night through the\r\ncold, relentless gratings for some fugitive ray of the existence of\r\nwhich it had such strong and sleepless presentiment.  It is a\r\nmystery.  It may seem irreverent to approach it even with a\r\nconjecture.  Human reason should be humble and silent before it, and\r\nclose its questioning lips.  It may not, however, transcend its\r\nprerogative to say meekly, _perhaps_.  Perhaps, then, for two-thirds\r\nof the duration that the sun has measured off to humanity, that life\r\nand immortality which the soul groped after were veiled from its\r\nvision, until all its mental and spiritual faculties had been\r\ntrained and strengthened to the ability to grasp and appropriate the\r\ngreat fact when it should be revealed.  Perhaps it required all the\r\nspace of forty centuries to put forth feelers and fibres capable of\r\nclinging to the revelation with the steady hold of faith.  Perhaps\r\nit was to prove, by long, decisive probation, what the unaided human\r\nmind could do in constructing its idealisms of immortality.  Perhaps\r\nit was permitted to erect a scaffolding of conceptions on which to\r\nreceive the great revelation at the highest possible level of\r\nthought and instinctive sentiment to which man could attain without\r\nsupernatural light and help.  If this last _perhaps_ is preferable\r\nto the others, where was this scaffolding the highest?  Over\r\nConfucius, or Socrates, or the Scandinavian seer, or Druid or Aztec\r\npriest?  Was it highest at Athens, because there the great apostle\r\nto the Gentiles planted his feet upon it, and said, in the ears of\r\nthe Grecian sophists, \"Him whom ye ignorantly worship declare I unto\r\nyou?\"  At that brilliant centre of pagan civilization it might have\r\nreached its loftiest altitude, measured by a purely intellectual\r\nstandard; but morally, this scaffolding was on the same low level of\r\nhuman life and character all the world around.  The immortalities\r\nerected by Egyptian or Grecian philosophy were no purer, in moral\r\nconception and attributes, than the mythological fantasies of the\r\nNorth American Indians.  In them all, human nature was to have the\r\nold play of its passions and appetites; in some of them, a wider\r\nsweep and sway.  There was not one in the whole set of Grecian\r\ndeities half so moral and pure, in sentiment and conduct, as\r\nSocrates; nor were Jupiter and his subordinate celestials better\r\nthan the average kings and courts of Greece.  Out of the hay, wood,\r\nand stubble of sheer fancy the human mind was left to raise these\r\nfantastic structures.  They exercised and entertained the\r\nimagination, but brought no light nor strength to the soul; no\r\nsuperior nor additional motives to shape the conduct of life.  But\r\nthey did this, undoubtedly, with all their delusions; they developed\r\nthe _thought_ of immortality among the most benighted races of men.\r\nTheir most perplexing unrealities kept the mind restless and almost\r\neager for some supplementary manifestation; so that, when the Star\r\nof Bethlehem shone out in the sky of Palestine, there were men\r\nlooking heavenward with expectant eyes at midnight.  From that hour\r\nto this, and among pagan tribes of the lowest moral perception, the\r\nheralds of the Great Revelation have found the _thought_ of another\r\nexistence active though confused.  They have found everywhere a\r\nplatform already erected, like that on which Paul stood in the midst\r\nof Mars Hill, and on which they could stand and say to heathen\r\ncommunities, \"Him whom ye ignorantly worship declare I unto you!\r\nThat future life and immortality which your darkened eyes and hungry\r\nsouls have been groping and hungering for, bring we to you, bright\r\nas the sun, in this great gospel of Divine Love.\"  Had the Star of\r\nBethlehem appeared a century earlier, it might not have met an\r\nupturned eye.  If the Saviour of Mankind had come into the world in\r\nSolomon's day, not even a manger might have been found to cradle His\r\nfirst moments of human life; no Simeon waiting in the temple to\r\ngreet the great salvation He brought to our race in His baby hands.\r\n\r\nHere, then, commences, as it were, the central era of the soul's\r\ntraining in time.  Here heaven opened upon it the full sunlight and\r\nsunwarmth of its glorious life and immortality.  Here fell upon its\r\nopening faculties the dews and rays and spiritual influences which\r\nwere to shape its being and destiny.  Here commenced such co-working\r\nto this end as can find no measure nor simile in any other sphere of\r\nco-operative activities in the world below or above.  Here the\r\ntrinity of man and the Trinity of the Godhead came into a co-action\r\nand fellowship overpassing the highest outside wonder of the\r\nuniverse.  And all this co-working, fellowship, and partnership has\r\nbeen repeated in the experience of every individual soul that has\r\nbeen fitted for this great immortality.  Here, too, this co-working\r\nis a law, not an incident; most marvellously, mightily, and minutely\r\na law, as legislatively and executively as that which we have seen\r\nacting upon the development of the flower.  Had not the great\r\napostle, who was caught up into the third heavens and heard things\r\nunutterable, spoken of this law in such bold words, it would seem\r\nrash and irreverent in us to approach so near to its sublime\r\nrevelation.  Not ours but his they are; and it is bold enough in us\r\nto repeat them.  He said it:  that He, to whose name every knee\r\nshould bow, and every tongue confess; to whom belonged and who\r\nshould possess and rule all the kingdoms of the earth, \"was made\r\nunder the law,\" not of Moses, not of human nature only, but under\r\nthis very law of CO-WORKING.  Through this the world was to be\r\nregenerated and filled with His life and light.  Through this a new\r\ncreation was to be enfolded in the bosom of His glory, of grander\r\ndimensions and of diviner attributes than that over which the\r\nmorning stars sang at the birth of time.  Said this law to the\r\nindividual soul, \"Work out your salvation with fear and trembling,\r\nfor it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of His own good\r\npleasure.\"  To will and to do.  It is His own good will and pleasure\r\nthat the soul shall be fitted and lifted up to its high destiny\r\nthrough this co-working.  It was His power to raise it to that\r\ncondition without man's participation or conscious acquiescence; but\r\nit was His will and pleasure to enact this law of salvation.\r\nLooking across the circumference of the individual soul, what says\r\nthis law?  \"Go ye out into all the world and preach the gospel to\r\nevery creature, and, lo, I am with you unto the end,\"--not as an\r\ninvisible companion, not merely with the still, small voice of the\r\nComforter to cheer you in trial, weakness and privation; but with\r\nyou as a _co-worker_, with the irresistible energies of the Spirit\r\nof Power.  He might have done the whole work alone.  He might have\r\nsent forth twelve, and twelve times twelve legions of angels, and\r\ngiven each a voice as loud as his who is to wake the dead, and bid\r\nthem preach His gospel in the ears of every human being.  He might\r\nhave given a tongue to every breathing of the breeze, an articulate\r\nspeech to every ray of light, and sent them out with their ceaseless\r\nvoices on the great errand of His love.  It was his power to do\r\nthis.  He did not do it, because it was His will and pleasure to put\r\nHimself under this law we have followed so far; to make men His co-\r\nworkers in this new creation, and co-heirs with Him in all its joy\r\nand glory.  So completely has He made this law His rule of action,\r\nthat, for eighteen hundred years, we have not a single instance in\r\nwhich the life and immortality which He brought to light have been\r\nrevealed to a human soul without the direct and active participation\r\nof a human instrumentality.  So completely have His meekest servants\r\non earth put themselves under this law, that not one of them dares\r\nto expect, hope, or pray that He will reveal Himself to a single\r\nbenighted heathen mind without this human co-working.\r\n\r\nThus, begin where you will, in the flower of the field or the hyssop\r\nby the wall, and ascend from sphere to sphere, until there is no\r\nmore space in things and beings created to draw another\r\ncircumferential line, and you will see the action and the result of\r\nthis great law of _Co-operative Activities_.  When I first looked\r\nwithin the lids of that hollyhock, and was incited to read the\r\nrudimental lessons of the new leaves that man's art had added to its\r\nscant, original volume, I had no thought of finding so much matter\r\nprinted on its pages.  I have transcribed it here in the order of\r\nits paragraphs, hoping that some who read them may see in this life\r\nof flowers an interest they may have partially overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO A THREE-THOUSAND-ACRE FARM--SAMUEL JONAS--HIS AGRICULTURAL\r\nOPERATIONS, THEIR EXTENT, SUCCESS, AND GENERAL ECONOMY.\r\n\r\nThe rain having ceased, I resumed my walk, in a southerly direction,\r\nto Chrishall Grange, the residence of Samuel Jonas, who may be\r\ncalled the largest farmer in England; not, perhaps, in extent of\r\nterritory occupied, but in the productive capacity of the land\r\ncultivated, and in the values realised from it.  It is about four\r\nmiles east of Royston, bordering on the three counties of\r\nCambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, and Essex, though lying mainly in the\r\nlatter.  It contains upwards of 3,000 acres, and nearly every one of\r\nthem is arable, and under active cultivation.  It consists of five\r\nfarms, belonging to four different landlords; still they are so\r\ncontiguous and coherent that they form substantially one great\r\nblock.  No one could be more deeply impressed with the magnitude of\r\nsuch an establishment, and of the operations it involves, than a New\r\nEngland farmer.  Taking the average of our agriculturists, their\r\nholdings or occupations, to use an English term, will not exceed 100\r\nacres each; and, including woodland, swamp, and mountain, not over\r\nhalf of this space can be cultivated.  To the owner and tiller of\r\nsuch a farm, a visit to Mr. Jonas' occupation must be interesting\r\nand instructive.  Here is a man who cultivates a space which thirty\r\nConnecticut farmers would feel themselves rich to own and occupy,\r\nwith families making a population of full two hundred souls,\r\nsupporting and filling a church and school-house.  In the great West\r\nof America, where cattle are bred and fed somewhat after the manner\r\nof Russian steppes or Mexican ranches, such an occupation would not\r\nbe unusual nor unexpected; but in the very heart of England,\r\ncontaining a space less than the state of Virginia, a tract of such\r\nextent and value in the hands of a single farmer is a fact which a\r\nNew Englander must regard at first with no little surprise.  He will\r\nnot wonder how one man can _rent_ such a space, but how he can\r\n_till_ it to advantage; how, even with the help of several\r\nintelligent and active sons, he can direct and supervise operations\r\nwhich fill the hands of thirty solid farmers of Massachusetts.  Two\r\nspecific circumstances enable him to perform this undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, agriculture in England is reduced to an exact\r\nand rigid science.  To use a nautical phrase, it is all plain\r\nsailing.  The course is charted even in the written contract with\r\nthe landlord.  The very term, \"_course_,\" is adopted to designate\r\nthe direction which the English farmer is to observe.  Skilled hands\r\nare plenty and pressing to man the enterprise.  With such a chart,\r\nand such a force, and such an open sea, it is as easy for him to\r\nsail the \"Great Eastern\" as a Thames schooner.  The helm of the\r\ngreat ship plays as freely and faithfully to the motion of his will\r\nas the rudder of the small craft.  Then the English farmer has a\r\ngreat advantage over the American in this circumstance:  he can hire\r\ncheaply a grade of labor which is never brought to our market.  Men\r\nof great skill and experience, who in America would conduct farms of\r\ntheir own, and could not be hired at any price, may be had here in\r\nabundance for foremen, at from twelve to sixteen shillings, or from\r\nthree to four dollars a week, they boarding and lodging themselves.\r\nAnd the number of such men is constantly increasing, from two\r\ndistinct causes.  In the first place there is a large generation of\r\nagricultural laborers in England, now in the prime of manhood, who\r\nhave just graduated, as it were, through all the scientific\r\nprocesses of agriculture developed in the last fifteen years.  The\r\nploughmen, cowmen, cartmen, and shepherds, even, have become\r\nfamiliar with the established routine; and every set of these hands\r\ncan produce one or two active and intelligent laborers who will\r\ngladly and ably fill the post of under-foreman for a shilling or two\r\na week of advanced wages.  Then, by the constant absorption of small\r\nholdings into large farms, which is going on more rapidly from this\r\nincreased facility of managing great occupations, a very\r\nconsiderable number of small farmers every year are falling into the\r\nlabor market, being reduced to the necessity of either emigrating to\r\ncheaper lands beyond the sea, or of hiring themselves out at home as\r\nmanagers, foremen or common laborers on the estates thus enlarged by\r\ntheir little holdings.  From these two sources of supply, the\r\nEnglish tenant-farmer, beyond all question, is able to cultivate a\r\nlarger space, and conduct more extensive operations than any other\r\nagriculturist in the world, at least by free labor.\r\n\r\nThe first peculiarity of this large occupation I noticed, was the\r\nextent of the fields into which it was divided.  I had never seen\r\nany so large before in England.  There were only three of the whole\r\nestate under 60, and some contained more than 400 acres each, giving\r\nthe whole an aspect of amplitude like that of a rolling prairie farm\r\nin Illinois.  Not one of the little, irregular morsels of land half\r\nswallowed by its broad-bottomed hedging, which one sees so\r\nfrequently in an English landscape, could be found on this great\r\nholding.  The white thorn fences were new, trim, and straight,\r\noccupying as little space as possible.  The five amalgamated farms\r\nare light turnip soil, with the exception of about 200 acres, which\r\nare well drained.  The whole surface resembles that of a heavy\r\nground swell of the sea; nearly all the fields declining gently in\r\ndifferent directions.  The view from the rounded crest of the\r\nhighest wave was exceedingly picturesque and beautiful, presenting a\r\nvista of plenty which Ceres of classic mythology never saw; for\r\nnever, in ancient Greece, Italy, or Egypt, were the crops of\r\nvegetation so diversified and contrasting with each other as are\r\ninterspersed over an English farm of the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if 3,000 acres of land, lying in one solid block,\r\ncould be found in England better adapted for testing and rewarding\r\nthe most scientific and expensive processes of agriculture, than\r\nthis great occupation of Mr. Jonas.  Certainly, no equal space could\r\npresent a less quantity of waste land, or occupy less in hedges or\r\nfences.  And it is equally certain that no estate of equal size is\r\nmore highly cultivated, or yields a greater amount of production per\r\nacre.  Its occupant, also, is what may be called an hereditary\r\nfarmer.  His father and his remote ancestors were farmers, and he,\r\nas in the case of the late Mr. Webb, has attained to his present\r\nposition as an agriculturist by practical farming.\r\n\r\nMr. Jonas cultivates his land on the \"Four-course system.\"  This\r\nvery term indicates the degree to which English agriculture has been\r\nreduced to a precise and rigid science.  It means here, that the\r\nwhole arable extent of his estate is divided equally between four\r\ngreat crops; or, wheat, 750 acres; barley and oats, 750; seeds and\r\npulse, 750; and roots, 750.  Now, an American farmer, in order to\r\nform an approximate idea of the amount of labor given to the growth\r\nof these crops, must remember that all these great fields of wheat,\r\noats, barley, turnips, beans, and peas, containing in all over 2,000\r\nacres, are hoed by hand once or twice.  His cereals are all drilled\r\nin at seven inches apart, turnips at seventeen.  The latter are\r\nhorse-hoed three or four times; and as they are drilled on the flat,\r\nor without ridging the surface of the ground, they are crossed with\r\na horse-hoe with eight V shaped blades.  This operation leaves the\r\nplants in bunches, which are singled out by a troop of children.\r\nOne hand-hoeing and two or three more horse-hoeings finish the labor\r\ngiven to their cultivation.  It is remarkable what mechanical skill\r\nis brought to bear upon these operations.  In the first place, the\r\nplough cuts a furrow as straight and even as if it were turned by\r\nmachinery.  A kind of esprit de corps animates the ploughmen to a\r\nvigorous ambition in the work.  They are trained to it with as much\r\nsingleness of purpose as the smiths of Sheffield are to the forging\r\nof penknife blades.  On a large estate like that occupied by Mr.\r\nJonas, they constitute an order, not of Odd Fellows, but of Straight\r\nFurrow-men, and are jealous of the distinction.  When the ground is\r\nwell prepared, and made as soft, smooth, and even as a garden, the\r\ndrilling process is performed with a judgement of the eye and skill\r\nof hand more marvellous still.  The straightness of the lines of\r\nverdure which, in a few weeks, mark the tracks of the seed-tubes, is\r\nsurprising.  They are drawn and graded with such precision that,\r\nwhen the plants are at a certain height, a horse-hoe, with eight\r\nblades, each wide enough to cut the whole intervening space between\r\ntwo rows, is passed, hoeing four or five drills at once.  Of course,\r\nif the lines of the drill and hoe did not exactly correspond with\r\neach other, whole rows of turnips would be cut up and destroyed.  I\r\nsaw this process going on in a turnip field, and thought it the most\r\nskilful operation connected with agriculture that I had ever\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal advantages Mr. Jonas realises in cultivating\r\nsuch an extent of territory, is the ability to economise his working\r\nforces, of man, beast, and agricultural machinery.  He saves what\r\nmay be called the superfluous fractions, which small farmers\r\nfrequently lose.  For instance, a man with only fifty acres would\r\nneed a pair of stout horses, a plough, cart, and all the other\r\nimplements necessary for the growth and gathering of the usual\r\ncrops.  Now, Mr. Jonas has proved by experience, that, in\r\ncultivating his great occupation, the average force of two and a\r\nquarter horses is sufficient for a hundred acres.  Here is a saving\r\nof almost one half the expense of horse-force per acre which the\r\nsmall farmer incurs, and full one half of the use of carts, ploughs,\r\nand other implements.  The whole number of horses employed is about\r\nseventy-six; and the number of men and boys about a hundred.  The\r\nwhole of this great force is directed by Mr. Jonas and his sons with\r\nas much apparent ease and equanimity as the captain of a Cunarder\r\nwould manifest in guiding a steamship across the Atlantic.  The helm\r\nand ropes of the establishment obey the motion of one mind with the\r\nsame readiness and harmony.\r\n\r\nA fact or two may serve an American farmer as a tangible measure\r\nwhereby to estimate the extent of the operations thus conducted by\r\none man.  To come up to the standard of scientific and successful\r\nagriculture in England, it is deemed requisite that a tenant farmer,\r\non renting an occupation, should have capital sufficient to invest\r\n10 pounds, or $50, per acre in stocking it with cattle, sheep,\r\nhorses, farming implements, fertilisers, etc.  Mr. Jonas, beyond a\r\ndoubt, invests capital after this ratio upon the estate he tills.\r\nIf so, then the total amount appropriated to the land which he\r\n_rents_ cannot be less than 30,000 pounds, or nearly $150,000.  The\r\ninventory of his live stock, taken at last Michaelmas, resulted in\r\nthese figures:--Sheep, 6,581 pounds; horses, 2,487 pounds; bullocks,\r\n2,218 pounds; pigs, 452 pounds; making a grand total of 11,638\r\npounds.  Every animal bred on the estate is fatted, but by no means\r\nwith the grain and roots grown upon it.  The outlay for oil-cake and\r\ncorn purchased for feeding, amounts to about 4,000 pounds per annum.\r\nAnother heavy expenditure is about 1,700 pounds yearly for\r\nartificial fertilisers, consisting of guano and blood-manure.  Mr.\r\nJonas is one of the directors of the company formed for the\r\nmanufacture of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe whole income of this establishment is realised from two sources-\r\n-meat and grain.  And this is the distinguishing characteristic of\r\nEnglish farming generally.  Not a pound of hay, straw, or roots is\r\nsold off the estate.  Indeed, this is usually prohibited by the\r\nconditions of the contract with the landlord.  So completely has Mr.\r\nJonas adhered to this rule, that he could not give me the market\r\nprice of hay, straw, or turnips per ton, as he had never sold any,\r\nand was not in the habit of noticing the market quotations of those\r\nproducts.  I was surprised at one fact which I learned in connection\r\nwith his economy.  He keeps about 170 bullocks; buying in October\r\nand selling in May.  Now, it would occasion an American farmer some\r\nwonderment to be told that this great herd of cattle is fed and\r\nfatted almost entirely for the manure they make.  It is doubtful if\r\nthe difference between the cost and selling prices averages 2\r\npounds, or $10, per head.  For instance, the bullocks bought in will\r\naverage 13 or 14 pounds.  A ton of linseed-cake and some meal are\r\ngiven to each beast before it is sent to market, costing from 10 to\r\n12 pounds.  When sold, the bullocks average 24 or 25 pounds.  Thus\r\nthe cake and the meal equal the whole difference between the buying\r\nand selling price, so that all the roots, chaff, and attendance go\r\nentirely to the account of manure.  These three items, together with\r\nthe value of pasturage for the months the cattle may lie in the\r\nfields, from October to May inclusive, could hardly amount to less\r\nthan 5 pounds per beast, which, for 170, would be 850 pounds.  Then\r\n1,700 pounds are paid annually for guano and artificial manures.\r\nNow add the value of the wheat, oat and barley straw grown on 1,500\r\nacres, and mostly thrown into the barn-yards, or used as bedding for\r\nthe stables, and you have one great division of the fertilising\r\ndepartment of Chrishall Grange.  The amount of these three items\r\ncannot be less than 3,000 pounds.  Then there is another source of\r\nfertilisation nearly as productive and valuable.  Upwards of 3,000\r\nsheep are kept on the estate, of which 1,200 are breeding ewes.\r\nThese are folded, acre by acre, on turnips, cole, or trefoil, and\r\nthose fattened for the market are fed with oil-cake in the field.\r\nThe locusts of Egypt could not have left the earth barer of verdure\r\nthan these sheep do the successive patches of roots in which they\r\nare penned for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, nor could any other\r\nprocess fertilise the land more thoroughly and cheaply.  Then 76\r\nhorses and 200 fattening hogs add their contingent to the manurial\r\nexpenditure and production of the establishment.  Thus the\r\nfertilising material applied to the estate cannot amount to less\r\nthan 5,000 pounds, or $24,000, per annum.\r\n\r\nSheep are the most facile and fertile source of nett income on the\r\nestate.  Indeed, nearly all the profit on the production of meat is\r\nrealised from them.  Most of those I saw were Southdowns and\r\nHampshires, pure or crossed, with here and there a Leicester.  After\r\nbeing well fattened, they fetch in the market about double the price\r\npaid for them as stock sheep.  About 2,000, thus fattened, including\r\nlambs, are sold yearly.  They probably average about 2 pounds, or\r\n$10, per head; thus amounting to the nice little sum of 4,000 pounds\r\na year, as one of the sources of income.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be easier to estimate the total expenditure than\r\nthe gross income of such an establishment as that of Mr. Jonas.  We\r\nhave aggregated the former in a lump; assuming that the whole\r\ncapital invested in rent, live stock, agricultural machinery,\r\nmanures, labor of man and horse, fattening material, etc., amounts\r\nto 30,000 pounds.  We may extract from this aggregate several\r\nestimated items which will indicate the extent of his operations,\r\nputting the largest expenditure at the head of the list.\r\n\r\nCorn and oil-cake purchased for feeding                    4,000l.\r\nGuano and manufactured manures                             1,700\r\nLabor of 100 men and boys at the average of 20l. per annum 2,000\r\nLabor of 76 horses, including their keep, 20l. per annum   1,500\r\nUse and wear of steam-engine and agricultural machinery      500\r\nCommutation money to men for beer                            400\r\n                                                           -----\r\n                                                          10,100l.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the positive annual outlays, without including\r\nrent, interest on capital invested, and other items that belong to\r\nthe debit side of the ledger.  The smallest on the list given I\r\nwould commend to the consideration of every New England farmer who\r\nmay read these pages.  It is stated under the real fact.  The\r\ncapacity of English laborers for drinking strong beer is a wonder to\r\nthe civilised world.  They seem to cling to this habit as to a vital\r\ncondition of their very life and being.  One would be tempted to\r\nthink that malt liquor was a primary and bread a secondary necessity\r\nto them; it must cost them most of the two, at any rate.  And\r\ngenerally they are as particular about the quality as the quantity,\r\nand complain if it is not of \"good body,\" as well as full tale.  In\r\nmany cases the farmer furnishes it to them; sometimes brewing it\r\nhimself, but more frequently buying it already made.  Occasionally a\r\nfarmer \"commutes\" with his men; allowing a certain sum of money\r\nweekly in lieu of beer, leaving them to buy and use it as they\r\nplease.  I understood that Mr. Jonas adopts the latter course, not\r\nonly to save himself the trouble of furnishing and rationing such a\r\nlarge quantity of beer, but also to induce the habit among his men\r\nof appropriating the money he gives them instead of drink to better\r\npurposes.  The sum paid to them last year was actually 452 pounds,\r\nor about $2,200!  Now, it would be quite safe to say, that there is\r\nnot a farm in the State of Connecticut that produces pasturage, hay,\r\ngrain, and roots enough to pay this beer-bill of a single English\r\noccupation!  This fact may not only serve to show the scale of\r\nmagnitude which agricultural enterprise has assumed in the hands of\r\nsuch men as Mr. Jonas, but also to indicate to our American farmers\r\nsome of the charges upon English agriculture from which they are\r\nexempt; thanks to the Maine Law, or, to a better one still, that of\r\nvoluntary disuse of strong drink on our farms.  I do not believe\r\nthat 100 laboring men and boys could be found on one establishment\r\nin Great Britain more temperate, intelligent, industrious, and moral\r\nthan the set employed by Mr. Jonas.  Still, notice the tax levied\r\nupon his land by this beer-impost.  It amounted last year to three\r\nEnglish shillings, or seventy-two cents, on every acre of the five\r\nconsolidated farms, including all the space occupied by hedges,\r\ncopses, buildings, etc.  Suppose a Maine farmer were obliged, by an\r\ninexorable law of custom, to pay a beer-tax of seventy-two cents per\r\nacre on his estate of 150 acres, or $108, annually, would he not be\r\nglad to \"commute\" with his hired men, by leaving them in possession\r\nof his holding and migrating to some distant section of the country\r\nwhere such a custom did not exist?\r\n\r\nThe gross income of this great holding it would be more difficult to\r\nestimate.  But no one can doubt the yearly issues of Mr. Jonas'\r\nbalance-sheet, when he has been able to expand his operations\r\ngradually to their present magnitude from the capital and experience\r\nacquired by successful farming.  Perhaps the principal sources of\r\nrevenue would approximate to the following figures:--\r\n\r\n 2,000 fat sheep and lambs at 2l.        4,000l.\r\n   150 fat bullocks at 25l.              3,750\r\n   200 fat pigs = 40,000 lbs., at 4d       666\r\n22,500 bushels of wheat, at 6s           6,750\r\n 9,375 bushels of oats, at 2s              937\r\n 7,500 bushels of barley, at 3s          1,125\r\n                                         -----\r\nTotal of these estimated items          17,228l.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is a mere estimate of the principal sources of\r\nincome upon which Mr. Jonas depends for a satisfactory result of his\r\nbalance-sheet.  Each item is probably within the mark.  I have put\r\ndown the crop of wheat of 750 acres at the average of thirty bushels\r\nper acre, and at 6s. per bushel, which are quite moderate figures.\r\nI have assumed 375 acres each for barley and oats, estimating the\r\nformer at forty bushels per acre, and the latter at fifty; then\r\nreserving half of the two crops for feeding and fatting the live\r\nstock; also all the beans, peas, and roots for the same purpose.  If\r\nthe estimate is too high on some items, the products sold, and not\r\nenumerated in the foregoing list, such as cole and other seeds, will\r\nrectify, perhaps, the differences, and make the general result\r\npresented closely approximate to the real fact.\r\n\r\nAs there is probably no other farm in Great Britain of the same size\r\nso well calculated to test the best agricultural science and economy\r\nof the day as the great occupation of Mr. Jonas, and as I am anxious\r\nto convey to American farmers a well-developed idea of what that\r\nscience and economy are achieving in this country, I will dwell upon\r\na few other facts connected with this establishment.  The whole\r\nspace of 3,000 acres is literally under cultivation, or in a sense\r\nwhich we in New England do not generally give to that term--that is,\r\nthere is not, I believe, a single acre of permanent meadow in the\r\nwhole territory.  All the vast amount of hay consumed, and all the\r\npasture grasses have virtually to be grown like grain.  There is so\r\nmuch ploughing and sowing involved in the production of these grass\r\ncrops, that they are called \"seeds.\"  Thus, by this four-course\r\nsystem, every field passes almost annually under a different\r\ncropping, and is mowed two or three times in ten years.  This fact,\r\nin itself, will not only suggest the immense amount of labor\r\napplied, but also the quality and condition of 3,000 acres of land\r\nthat can be surfaced to the scythe in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe _seeds_ or grasses sown by Mr. Jonas for pasturage and hay are\r\nchiefly white and red clover and trefoil.  His rule of seeding is\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\nWheat,  from      8 to 10 pecks per acre\r\nBarley, from     12 to 14   \"    \"    \"\r\nOats,   from     18 to 22   \"    \"    \"\r\nWinter Beans,     8         \"    \"    \"\r\nRed Clover,      20 lbs          \"    \"\r\nWhite Clover,    16 lbs          \"    \"\r\nTrefoil,         30 to 35 lbs.   \"    \"\r\n\r\nThis, in New England, would be called very heavy seeding, especially\r\nin regard to oats and the grasses.  I believe that twelve pecks of\r\noats to the acre, rather exceed our average rule.  Good clover seed\r\nshould weigh two pounds to the quart, and eight quarts, or sixteen\r\npounds, are the usual seeding with us.\r\n\r\nAs labor of horse and man must be economised to the best advantage\r\non such an estate, it may be interesting to know the expense of the\r\nprincipal operations.  The cost of ploughing averages 7s. 6d., or $1\r\n80c. per acre.  For roots, the land is ploughed three or four times,\r\nbesides harrowing, drilling, and rolling.  The hoeing of wheat and\r\nroots varies from 2s. to 5s., or from 48c. to $1 20c. per acre.\r\n\r\nThe sheep are all folded on turnips or grass fields, except the\r\nbreeding ewes in the lambing season.  The enclosures are made of\r\n_hurdles_, of which all reading Americans have read, but not one in\r\na thousand ever has seen.  They are a kind of diminutive, portable,\r\npost-and-rail fence, of the New England pattern, made up in\r\npermanent _lengths_, so light that a stout man might carry two or\r\nthree of them on his shoulders at once.  The two posts are sawed or\r\nsplit pieces of wood, about two inches thick, three wide, and from\r\nfive to six feet in length.  They are generally square-morticed for\r\nthe rails, which are frequently what we should call split hoop-\r\nholes, but in the best kind are slats of hard wood, about two and a\r\nhalf inches wide and one in thickness.  Midway between the two\r\nposts, the rails are nailed to an upright slat or brace, to keep\r\nthem from swaying.  Sometimes a farmer makes his own hurdles, thus\r\nfurnishing indoor work for his men in winter, when they cannot labor\r\nin the fields; but most generally they are bought of those who\r\nmanufacture them on a large scale.  Some idea of the extent of\r\nsheep-folding on Chrishall Grange may be inferred from the fact,\r\nthat the hurdling on it, if placed in one straight, continuous line,\r\nwould reach full ten miles!\r\n\r\nA portable steam engine, of twelve-horse power, looking like a\r\ncommon railway locomotive strayed from its track and taken up and\r\nhoused in a farmer's waggon-shed, performs prodigies of activity and\r\nlabor.  Indeed, search the three realms through and through, and you\r\nwould hardly find one on its own legs doing such remarkable\r\nvarieties of work.  Briareus, with all his fabled faculties, never\r\nhad such numerous and supple fingers as this creature of human\r\ninvention.  When set a-going, they are clattering and whisking and\r\nfrisking everywhere, on the barn-floor, on the hay-loft, in the\r\ngranary, under the eaves, down cellar, and all this at the same\r\ntime.  It is doubtful if any stationary engine in a machine shop\r\never performed more diversified operations at once; thus proving\r\nmost conclusively how a farmer may work motive power which it was\r\nonce thought preposterous in him to think of using.  It threshes\r\nwheat and other kinds of grain at the rate of from 400 to 500\r\nbushels a day; it conveys the straw up to a platform across what we\r\ncall the \"_great beams_,\" where it is cut into chaff and dropped\r\ninto a great bay, at the trifling expense of sixpence, or twelve\r\ncents, per quantity grown on an acre!  While it is doing this in one\r\ndirection, it is turning machinery in another that cleans and weighs\r\nthe grain off into sacks ready for the market.  Open the doors right\r\nand left and you find it at work like reason, breaking oil-cake,\r\ngrinding corn for the fat stock, turning the grindstone, pitching,\r\npounding, paring, rubbing, grabbing, and twisting, threshing,\r\nwrestling, chopping, flopping, and hopping, after the manner of \"The\r\nWaters of Lodore.\"\r\n\r\nThe housings for live stock are most admirably constructed as well\r\nas extensive, and all the great yards are well fitted for making and\r\ndelivering manure.  I noticed here the best arrangement for feeding\r\nswine that I had ever seen before, and of a very simple character.\r\nInstead of revolving troughs, or those that are to be pulled out\r\nlike drawers to be cleaned, a long, stationary one, generally of\r\niron, extends across the whole breadth of the compartment next to\r\nthe feeding passage.  The board or picket-fence forming this end of\r\nthe enclosure, from eight to twelve feet in length, is hung on a\r\npivot at each side, playing in an iron ring or socket let into each\r\nof the upright posts that support it.  Midway in the lower rail of\r\nthis fence is a drop bolt which falls into the floor just behind the\r\ntrough.  At the feeding time, the man has only to raise this bolt\r\nand let it fall on the inner side, and he has the whole length and\r\nwidth of the trough free to clear with a broom and to fill with the\r\nfeed.  Then, raising the bolt, and bringing it back to its first\r\nplace, the operation is performed in a minute with the greatest\r\neconomy and convenience.\r\n\r\nThere was one feature of this great farm home which I regarded with\r\nmuch satisfaction.  It was the housing of the laborers employed on\r\nthe estate.  This is done in blocks of well-built, well-ventilated,\r\nand very comfortable cottages, all within a stone's throw of the\r\nnoble old mansion occupied by Mr. Jonas.  Thus, no long and weary\r\nmiles after the fatigue of the day, or before its labor begins, have\r\nto be walked over by his men in the cold and dark, as in many cases\r\nin which the agricultural laborer is obliged to trudge on foot from\r\na distant village to his work, making a hard and sunless journey at\r\nboth ends of the day.\r\n\r\nAlthough my visit at this, perhaps the largest, farming\r\nestablishment in England, occupied only a few hours, I felt on\r\nleaving that I had never spent an equal space of time more\r\nprofitably and pleasantly in the pursuit or appreciation of\r\nagricultural knowledge.  The open and large-hearted hospitality and\r\ngenial manners of the proprietor and his family seemed to correspond\r\nwith the dimensions and qualities of his holding, and to complete,\r\nvitalise, and beautify the symmetries of a true ENGLISH FARMER'S\r\nHOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYSTON AND ITS SPECIALITIES--ENTERTAINMENT IN A SMALL VILLAGE--ST.\r\nIVES--VISITS TO ADJOINING VILLAGES--A FEN-FARM--CAPITAL INVESTED IN\r\nENGLISH AND AMERICAN AGRICULTURE COMPARED--ALLOTMENTS AND GARDEN\r\nTENANTRY--BARLEY GROWN ON OATS.\r\n\r\nFrom Chrishall Grange I went on to Royston, where I found very quiet\r\nand comfortable quarters in a small inn called \"The Catherine\r\nWheel,\" for what reason it is not yet clear to my mind, and the\r\nlandlady could not enlighten me on the subject.  I have noticed two\r\ninns in London of the same name, and have seen it mounted on several\r\nother public houses in England.  Why that ancient saint and the\r\nmachinery of her torture should be alone selected from the history\r\nand host of Christian martyrs, and thus associated with houses of\r\nentertainment for man and beast, is a mystery which I will not\r\nundertake to explore.  To be sure, the head of a puncheon of rum is\r\nround like a wheel, and if the liquor were not too much diluted with\r\nwater, it might make a revolving illumination quite interesting, if\r\nset on fire and rolled into the gutter.  It may possibly suggest\r\nthat lambent ignition of the brain which the fiery drinks of the\r\nestablishment produce, and which so many infatuated victims think\r\ndelightful.  Both these inferences, and all others I could fancy,\r\nare so dubious that I will not venture further into the meaning of\r\nthis singular appellation given to a tavern.\r\n\r\nRoyston is a goodly and comfortable town, just inside the eastern\r\nboundary of Hertfordshire.  It has its full share of half-legible\r\nand interesting antiquities, including the ruins of a royal palace,\r\na cave, and several other broken monuments of the olden time, all\r\nfestooned with the web-work of hereditary fancies, legends, and\r\nshreds of unravelled history dyed to the vivid colors of variegated\r\nimagination.  It also boasts and enjoys a great, breezy common,\r\nlarge enough to hold such another town, and which few in the kingdom\r\ncan show.  Then, if it cannot cope with Glastonbury in showing, to\r\nthe envious and credulous world, a thorn-tree planted by Joseph of\r\nArimathaea, and blossoming always at Christmas, it can fly a bird of\r\ngreater antiquity, which never flapped its wings elsewhere, so far\r\nas I can learn.  It may be the lineal descendant of Noah's raven\r\nthat has come down to this particular community without a cross with\r\nany other branch of the family.  It is called \"The Royston Crow,\"\r\nand is a variety of the genus which you will find in no other\r\ncountry.  It is a great, heavy bird, larger than his colored\r\nAmerican cousin, and is distinguished by a white back.  Indeed, seen\r\nwalking at a distance, he looks like our Bobolink expanded to the\r\nsize of a large hen-hawk.  To have such a wild bird all to\r\nthemselves, and of its own free will, notwithstanding the length and\r\npower of its wings, and the force of centrifugal attractions, is a\r\ndistinction which the good people of this favored town have good\r\nreason to appreciate at its proper value.  Nor are they insensible\r\nto the honor.  The town printer put into my hands a monthly\r\npublication called \"THE ROYSTON CROW,\" containing much interesting\r\nand valuable information.  It might properly have embraced a chapter\r\non entomology; but, perhaps, it would have been impolitic for the\r\npersonal interests of the bird to have given wide publicity to facts\r\nin this department of knowledge.  For, after all, there may exist in\r\nthe neighborhood certain special kinds of bugs and other insects\r\nwhich lie at the foundation of his preference for the locality.\r\n\r\nThe next day I again faced northward, and walked as far as Caxton, a\r\nsmall, rambling village, which looked as if it had not shaved and\r\nwashed its face, and put on a clean shirt for a shocking length of\r\ntime.  It was dark when I reached it; having walked twelve miles\r\nafter three p.m.  There was only one inn, properly speaking, in the\r\ntown, and since the old coaching time, it had contracted itself into\r\nthe fag-end of a large, dark, seedy-looking building, where it lived\r\nby selling beer and other sharp and cheap drinks to the villagers;\r\nnineteen-twentieths of whom appeared to be agricultural laborers.\r\nThe entertainment proffered on the sign-board over the door was\r\nevidently limited to the tap-room.  Indeed, this and the great, low-\r\njointed and brick-floored kitchen opening into to it, seemed to\r\nconstitute all the living or inhabited space in the building.  I\r\nsaw, at a glance, that the chance for a bed was faint and small; and\r\nI asked Landlord Rufus for one doubtingly, as one would ask for a\r\nready-made pulpit or piano at a common cabinet-maker's shop.  He\r\nanswered me clearly enough before he spoke, and he spoke as if\r\nanswering a strange and half-impertinent question, looking at me\r\nsearchingly, as if he suspected I was quizzing him.  His \"No!\" was\r\nshort and decided; but, seeing I was honest and earnest in the\r\ninquiry, he softened his negative with the explanation that their\r\nbeds were all full.  It seemed strange to me that this should be so\r\nin a building large enough for twenty, and I hesitated hopefully,\r\nthinking he might remember some small room in which he might put me\r\nfor the night.  To awaken a generous thought in him in this\r\ndirection, I intimated how contented I would be with the most\r\nmoderate accommodation.  But it was in vain.  The house was full,\r\nand I must seek for lodging elsewhere.  There were two or three\r\nother public houses in the village that might take me in.  I went to\r\nthem one by one.  They all kept plenty of beer, but no bed.  They,\r\ntoo, looked at me with surprise for asking for such a thing.\r\nApparently, there had been no demand for such entertainment by any\r\ntraveller since the stage-coach ceased to run through the village.\r\nI went up and down, trying to negotiate with the occupants of some\r\nof the best-looking cottages for a cot or bunk; but they had none to\r\nspare, as the number of wondering children that stared at me kindly,\r\nat once suggested before I put the question.\r\n\r\nIt was now quite dark, and I was hungry and tired; and the prospect\r\nof an additional six miles walk was not very animating.  What next?\r\nI will go back to Landlord Rufus and try a new influence on his\r\nsensibilities.  Who knows but it will succeed?  I will touch him on\r\nhis true character as a Briton.  So I went back, with my last chance\r\nhanging on the experiment.  I told him I was an American traveller,\r\nweary, hungry, and infirm of health, and would pay an extra price\r\nfor an extra effort to give me a bed for the night.  I did not say\r\nall this in a Romanus-civus-sum sort of tone.  No! dear, honest Old\r\nAbe, you would have done the same in my place.  I made the great\r\nAmerican Eagle coo like a dove in the request; and it touched the\r\nbest instincts of the British Lion within the man.  It was evident\r\nin a moment that I had put my case in a new aspect to him.  He would\r\ntalk with the \"_missus_;\" he withdrew into the back kitchen, a short\r\nconference ensued, and both came out together and informed me that\r\nthey had found a bed, unexpectedly vacant, for my accommodation.\r\nAnd they would get up some tea and bread and butter for me, too.\r\nCapital!  A sentiment of national pride stole in between every two\r\nfeelings of common satisfaction at this result.  The thought would\r\ncome in and whisper, not for your importunity as a common fellow\r\nmortal were this bed and this loaf unlocked to you, but because you\r\nwere an American citizen.\r\n\r\nSo I followed \"the missus\" into that great kitchen, and sat down in\r\none corner of the huge fire-place while she made the tea.  It was a\r\ncapacious museum of culinary curiosities of the olden time, all\r\narranged in picturesque groups, yet without any aim at effect.\r\nPots, kettles, pans, spits, covers, hooks and trammels of the\r\nElizabethan period, apparently the heirlooms of several intersecting\r\ngenerations, showed in the fire-light like a work of artistry; the\r\nsharp, silvery brightness of the tin and the florid flush of\r\nburnished copper making distinct disks in the darkness.  It was with\r\na rare sentiment of comfort that I sat by that fire of crackling\r\nfaggots, looked up at the stars that dropped in their light as they\r\npassed over the top of the great chimney, and glanced around at the\r\nsides of that old English kitchen, panelled with plates and platters\r\nand dishes of all sizes and uses.  And this fire was kindled and\r\nthis tea-kettle was singing for me really because I was an American!\r\nI could not forget that--so I deemed it my duty to keep up the\r\ncharacter.  Therefore, I told the _missus_ and her bright-eyed niece\r\na great many stories about America; some of which excited their\r\nadmiration and wonder.  Thus I sat at the little, round, three-\r\nlegged table, inside the out-spreading chimney, for an hour or more,\r\nand made as cozy and pleasant a meal of it as ever I ate.  Besides\r\nall this, I had the best bed in the house, and several \"Good\r\nnights!\" on retiring to it, uttered with hearty good-will by voices\r\nsoftened to an accent of kindness.  Next morning I was introduced\r\ninto the best parlor, and had a capital breakfast, and then resumed\r\nmy walk with a pleasant memory of my entertainment in that village\r\ninn.\r\n\r\nI passed through a fertile and interesting section to St. Ives, in\r\nHuntingdonshire.  Here I remained with some friends for a week,\r\nvisiting neighboring villages by day and returning at night.  St.\r\nIves is a pleasant, well-favored town, just large enough to\r\nconstitute a coherent, neighborly, and well-regulated community.  It\r\nis the centre-piece of a rich, rural picture, which, without any\r\nstrikingly salient features, pleases the eye with lineaments of\r\nquiet beauty symmetrically developed by the artistry of Nature.  The\r\nriver Ouse meanders through a wide, fertile flat, or what the Scotch\r\nwould call a strath, which gently rises on each side into pleasantly\r\nundulating uplands.  Parks, groves, copses, and hedge-row trees are\r\ninterspersed very happily, and meadow, pasture, and grain-fields\r\nseen through them, with villages, hamlets, farm-houses, and isolated\r\ncottages, make up a landscape that grows more and more interesting\r\nas you contemplate it.  And this placid locality, with its peaceful\r\nriver seemingly sleeping in the bosom of its long and level meadows,\r\nwas the scene of Oliver Cromwell's young, fiery manhood.  Here,\r\nwhere Nature invites to tranquil occupations and even exercises of\r\nthe mind, he trained the latent energies of his will for action in\r\nthe great drama that overturned a throne and transformed a nation.\r\nHere, till very lately, stood his \"barn,\" and here he drilled the\r\nfirst squadron of his \"Ironsides.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend and host drove me one day to see a fen-farm a few miles\r\nbeyond Ramsey, at which we remained over night and enjoyed the old-\r\nfashioned English hospitality of the establishment with lively\r\nrelish.  It was called \"The Four-Hundred-Acre-Farm,\" to distinguish\r\nit from a hundred others, laid out on the same dead level, with\r\nlines and angles as straight and sharp as those of a brick.  You\r\nwill meet scores of persons in England who speak admiringly of the\r\ngreat prairies of our Western States--but I never saw one in\r\nIllinois as extensive as the vast level expanse you may see in\r\nCambridgeshire and Lincolnshire.  In fact, the space of a large\r\ncounty has been fished up out of a shallow sea of salt water by\r\nhuman labor and capital.  I will not dwell here upon the expense,\r\nprocess, and result of this gigantic operation.  It would require a\r\nwhole chapter to convey an approximate idea of the character and\r\ndimensions of the enterprise.  The feat of Cyrus in turning the\r\ncurrent of the Euphrates was the mere making of a short mill-race\r\ncompared with the labor of lifting up these millions of acres bodily\r\nout of the flood that had covered and held them in quiescent\r\nsolution since the world began.\r\n\r\nThis Great Prairie of England, generally called here the Fens, or\r\nFenland, would be an interesting and instructive section for the\r\nagriculturists of our Western States to visit.  They would see how\r\nsuch a region can be made quite picturesque, as well as luxuriantly\r\nproductive.  Let them look off upon the green sea from one of the\r\nupland waves, and it will be instructive to them to see and know,\r\nthat all the hedge-trees, groves, and copses that intersect and\r\ninternect the vast expanse of green and gold were planted by man's\r\nhands.  Such a landscape would convince them that the prairies of\r\nIllinois and Iowa may be recovered from their almost depressing\r\nmonotony by the same means.  The soil of this district is apparently\r\nthe same as that around Chicago--black and deep, on a layer of clay.\r\nIt pulverises as easily in dry weather, and makes the same inky and\r\nsticky composition in wet.  To give it more body, or to cross it\r\nwith a necessary and supplementary element, a whole field is often\r\ntrenched by the spade as clean as one could be furrowed by the\r\nplough.  By this process the substratum of clay is thrown up, to a\r\nconsiderable thickness, upon the light, black, almost volatile soil,\r\nand mixed with it when dry; thus giving it a new character and\r\ncapacity of production.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to grow on a Californian scale in this fen\r\ndistrict.  Although the soil thus rescued from the waters that had\r\nflooded and half dissolved it, was at first as deep, black, and\r\nnaturally fertile as that of our prairies, those who commenced its\r\ncultivation did not make the same mistake as did our Western\r\nfarmers.  They did not throw their manure into the broad draining\r\ncanals to get rid of it, trusting to the inexhaustible fertility of\r\nthe alluvial earth, as did the wheat growers of Indiana and Illinois\r\nto their cost; but they husbanded and well applied all the resources\r\nof their barn-yards.  In consequence of this economy, there is no\r\ndeterioration of annual averages of their crops to be recorded, as\r\nin some of our prairie States, which have been boasting of the\r\nnatural and inexhaustible fertility of their soil even with the\r\nrecord of retrograde statistics before their eyes.  The grain and\r\nroot crops are very heavy; and a large business is done in growing\r\nturnip seed for the world in some sections of this fen country.  A\r\nlarge proportion of the quantity we import comes from these low\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nOur host of the Four-Hundred-Acre Farm took us over his productive\r\noccupation, which was in a very high state of cultivation.  The\r\nwheat was yellowing to harvest, and promised a yield of forty-two\r\nbushels to the acre.  The oats were very heavy, and the root crops\r\nlooked well, especially a field of mangel-wurzel.  He apportions his\r\nland to different crops after this ratio:-- Wheat, 120 acres; oats,\r\n80; rye-grass and clover, 50; roots, 60.  His live stock consisted\r\nof 300 sheep, 50 to 60 head of cattle, and 70 to 80 hogs.  His\r\nworking force was from 10 to 12 men, 14 farm horses, and 4 nags.  It\r\nmay interest some of my American readers to know the number,\r\ncharacter, and cost of the implements employed by this substantial\r\nEnglish farmer in cultivating an estate of 400 acres.  I noted down\r\nthe following list, when he was showing us his tool-house:--\r\n\r\n                            l.       $     l.    $\r\n6 Ploughs               at  4 each = 20    24 = 120\r\n6 Horse-carts,          at 14 each = 70    84 = 420\r\n1 Large Iron Roller and Gearing,           13 =  65\r\n1 Cambridge Roller                         14 =  70\r\n1 Twelve-Coulter Drill                     46 = 230\r\n3 Harrows               at  3 each = 15     9 =  45\r\n2 Great Harrows         at  3 each = 15     6 =  30\r\n                                           ---  ---\r\nTotal cost of these Implements            196l.$980\r\n\r\nThese figures will represent the working forces and implemental\r\nmachinery of a well-tilled farm of 400 acres in England.  They will\r\nalso indicate the amount of capital required to cultivate an estate\r\nof this extent here.  Let us compare it with the amount generally\r\ninvested in New England for a farm of equal size.  Thousands that\r\nhave been under cultivation for a hundred years, may be bought for 5\r\npounds, or $25, per acre, including house, barn, and other buildings\r\nand appurtenances.  It is a very rare thing for a man with us to buy\r\n400 acres at once; but if he did, it would probably be on these\r\nconditions:-- He would pay 400 pounds, or $2,000, down at the time\r\nof purchase, giving his notes for the remaining 1,600 pounds, or\r\n$8,000, at 6 per cent. interest payable annually, together with the\r\nyearly instalment of principal specified in each note.  He would\r\nperhaps have 200 pounds, or $1,000, left of his capital for working\r\npower and agricultural implements.  He would probably divide it\r\nafter the following manner:--\r\n\r\n                                            l.   l.   $\r\n2 Yokes of Oxen, at                         25 = 50 = 250\r\n1 Horse                                          20 = 100\r\n2 Ox-carts, at                              15 = 30 = 150\r\n1 Waggon                                         20 = 100\r\n2 Ox-sleds, at                               1 =  2 =  10\r\n2 Ox-ploughs, at                             2 =  4 =  20\r\n1 Single Horse-plough                             1 =   5\r\n2 Harrows                                    2 =  4 =  20\r\nCradles, scythes, hoes, rakes, flails, etc.       4 =  20\r\nFanning-mill, hay-cutter, and corn-sheller.       4 =  20\r\n15 Cows, steers, and heifers                     45 = 225\r\n6 Shoats, or pigs, six months old                10 =  50\r\n\r\nThese figures would indicate a large operation for a practical New\r\nEngland farmer, who should undertake to purchase and cultivate an\r\nestate of 400 acres.  Indeed, not one in a hundred buying such a\r\nlarge tract of land would think of purchasing all the implements on\r\nthis list at once, or entirely new.  One of his carts, sleds, and\r\nharrows would very probably be \"second-handed,\" and bought at half\r\nthe price of a new one.  Thus, a substantial farmer with us would\r\nthink he was beginning on a very satisfactory and liberal footing,\r\nif he had 200 pounds, or $1,000, in ready money for stocking a\r\nholding of 400 acres with working cattle and implemental machinery,\r\ncows, pigs, etc.  Now, compare this outlay with that of our host of\r\nthe Four-Hundred-Acre Farm in Lincolnshire.  We will begin with his-\r\n-\r\n\r\n                                                l.         l.    $\r\n 14 Farm horses, at the low figure of         20 each =  280 = 1,400\r\n  4 Nags, or saddle and carriage horses       2O each =   8O =   400\r\n300 Stock sheep                                1 each =  300 = 1,500\r\n 7O Pigs, of different ages                    2 each =  140 =   900\r\n 5O Head of cattle (cows, bullocks, etc.)     12 each =  600 = 3,000\r\nCarts, drills, rollers, ploughs and other implements   1,000 = 5,000\r\n                                                       -----   -----\r\n                                                       2,400 $12,200\r\n\r\nThe average rent of such land in England must be at least 1 pound\r\n10s. per acre, and the tenant farmer must pay half of this out of\r\nthe capital he begins with; which, on 400 acres, would amount to 300\r\npounds.  Then, if he buys a quantity of artificial manures equal to\r\nthe value of 10s. per acre, he will need to expend in this\r\ndepartment 200 pounds.  Next, if he purchases corn and oil-cake at\r\nthe same ratio for his cattle and sheep as that adopted by Mr.\r\nJonas, of Chrishall Grange, he will want 1,000 pounds for his 60\r\nhead of cattle and 300 sheep.  In addition to these items of\r\nexpenditure, he must pay his men weekly; and the wages of ten, at\r\n10s. per week, for six months, amount to 130 pounds.  Add an\r\neconomical allowance for family expenses for the same length of\r\ntime, and for incidental outgoes, and you make up the aggregate of\r\n4,000 pounds, which is 10 pounds to the acre, which an English\r\nfarmer needs to have and invest on entering upon the cultivation of\r\na farm, great or small.  This amount, as has been stated elsewhere,\r\nis the rule for successful agriculture in this country.\r\n\r\nThese facts will measure the difference between the amounts of\r\ncapital invested in equal spaces of land in England and America.  It\r\nis as ten to one, assuming a moderate average.  Here, a man would\r\nneed 1,500 pounds, or more than $7,000, to begin with on renting a\r\nfarm of 150 acres, in order to cultivate it successfully.  In New\r\nEngland, a man would think he began under favorable auspices if he\r\nwere able to enter upon the occupancy of equal extent with 100\r\npounds, or about $500.\r\n\r\nOn returning from the Fens, I passed the night and most of the\r\nfollowing day at Woodhurst, a village a few miles north of St. Ives,\r\non the upland rising gently from the valley of the Ouse.  My host\r\nhere was a farmer, owning the land he tilled, cultivating it and the\r\nmoral character and happiness of the little community, in which he\r\nmoved as a father, with an equally generous heart and hand, and\r\nreaping a liberal reward from both departments of his labor.  He\r\ntook me over his fields, and showed me his crops and live stock,\r\nwhich were in excellent condition.  Harvesting had already\r\ncommenced, and the reapers were at work, men and women, cutting\r\nwheat and barley.  Few of them used sickles, but a curved knife,\r\nwider than the sickle, of nearly the same shape, minus the teeth.  A\r\nman generally uses two of them.  With the one in his left hand he\r\ngathers in a good sweep of grain, bends it downward, and with the\r\nother strikes it close to the ground, as we cut Indian corn.  With\r\nthe left-hand hook and arm, he carries on the grain from the inside\r\nto the outside of the swath or \"work,\" making three or four strokes\r\nwith the cutting knife; then, at the end, gathers it all up and lays\r\nit down in a heap for binding.  This operation is called \"bagging.\"\r\nIt does not do the work so neatly as the sickle, and is apt to pull\r\nup many stalks by the roots with the earth attaching to them,\r\nespecially at the last, outside stroke.\r\n\r\nI was struck with the economy adopted by my host in loading, carting\r\nand stacking or ricking his grain.  The operation was really\r\nperformed like clock-work.  Two or three men were stationed at the\r\nrick to unload the carts, two in the fields to load them, and\r\nseveral boys to lead them back and forth to the two parties.  They\r\nwere all one-horse carts, and so timed that a loaded one was always\r\nat the rick and an empty one always in the field; thus keeping the\r\nmen at both ends fully employed from morning until night, pitching\r\non and pitching off; while boys, at 6d. or 8d. a day, led the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nOn passing through the stables and housings for stock, I noticed a\r\nsimple, yet ingenious contrivance for watering cattle, which I am\r\nnot sure I can describe accurately enough, without a drawing, to\r\nconvey a tangible idea of it to my agricultural neighbors in\r\nAmerica.  It may be called the buoy-cock.  In the first place, the\r\nwater is brought into a cistern placed at one end of the stable or\r\nshed at a sufficient elevation to give it the necessary fall in all\r\nthe directions in which it is to be conducted.  The pipe used for\r\neach cow-box or manger connects each with the cistern, and the\r\ndistributing end of it rests upon, or is suspended over, the trough\r\nassigned to each animal.  About one-third of this trough, which was\r\nhere a cast-iron box, about twelve inches deep and wide, protrudes\r\nthrough the boarding of the stable.  In this outside compartment is\r\nplaced a hollow copper ball attached to a lever, which turns the\r\naxle or pivot of the cock.  Now, this little buoy, of course, rises\r\nand falls with the water in the trough.  When the trough is full,\r\nthe buoy rises and raises the lever so as to shut off the water\r\nentirely.  At every sip the animal takes, the buoy descends and lets\r\non again, to a drop, a quantity equal to that abstracted from the\r\ninside compartment.  Thus the trough is always kept full of pure\r\nwater, without losing a drop of it through a waste-pipe or overflow.\r\nWhere a great herd of cattle and a drove of horses have to be\r\nsupplied from a deep well, as in the case of Mr. Jonas, at Chrishall\r\nGrange, this buoy-cock must save a great amount of labor.\r\n\r\nI saw also here in perfection that garden allotment system which is\r\nnow coming widely into vogue in England, not only adjoining large\r\ntowns like Birmingham, but around small villages in the rural\r\ndistricts.  It is well worthy of being introduced in New England and\r\nother states, where it would work equally well in various lines of\r\ninfluence.  A landowner divides up a field into allotments, each\r\ngenerally containing a rood, and lets them to the mechanics,\r\ntradespeople and agricultural laborers of the town or village, who\r\nhave no gardens of their own for the growth of vegetables.  Each of\r\nthese is better than a savings-bank to the occupant.  He not only\r\ndeposits his odd pennies but his odd hours in it; keeping both away\r\nfrom the public-house or from places and habits of idleness and\r\ndissipation.  The days of Spring and Summer here are very long, and\r\na man can see to work in the field as early as three o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and as late as nine at night.  So every journeyman\r\nblacksmith, baker or shoemaker may easily find four or five hours in\r\nthe twenty-four for work on his allotment, after having completed\r\nthe task or time due to his employer.  He generally keeps a pig, and\r\nis on the qui vive to make and collect all the manure he can for his\r\nlittle farm.  A field of several acres, thus divided and cultivated\r\nin allotments, presents as striking a combination of colors as an\r\nAxminster carpet.  As every rood is subdivided into a great variety\r\nof vegetables, and as forty or fifty of such patches, lying side by\r\nside, present, in one coup d'oeil, all the alternations of which\r\nthese crops and colors are susceptible, the effect is very\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nMy Woodhurst friend makes his allotment system a source of much\r\nsocial enjoyment to himself and the poor villagers.  He lets forty-\r\nseven patches, each containing twenty poles.  Every tenant pays\r\n10s., or $2 40c., annual rent for his little holding, Mr. E. drawing\r\nthe manure for each, which is always one good load a year.  Here,\r\ntoo, these little spade-farmers are put under the same regime as the\r\ngreat tenant agriculturists of the country.  Each must farm his\r\nallotment according to the terms of the yearly lease.  He must dig\r\nup his land with spade or pick, not plough it; and he is not allowed\r\nto work on it upon the Sabbath.  But encouragements greatly\r\npredominate over restrictions, and stimulate and reward a high\r\ncultivation.  _Eight_ prizes are offered to this end, of the\r\nfollowing amounts:--10s., 7s. 6d., 5s., 4s., 3s., 2s. 6d., 2s. and\r\n1s.  Every one who competes must not have more than half his\r\nallotment in potatoes.  The greater the variety of vegetables the\r\nother half contains, the better is his chance for the first prize.\r\nThe appraiser is some disinterested person of good judgment, perhaps\r\nfrom an adjoining town, who knows none of the competitors.  To\r\nprevent any possible favoritism, the allotments are all numbered,\r\nand he awards prizes to numbers only, not knowing to whom they\r\nbelong.  Another feature, illustrating the generous disposition of\r\nthe proprietor, characterises this good work.  On the evening\r\nappointed for paying the rents, he gets up a regular, old-fashioned\r\nEnglish supper of roast beef and plum-pudding for them, giving each\r\nfourpence instead of beer, so that they may all go home sober as\r\nwell as cheerful.  To see him preside at that table, with his large,\r\nround, rosy face beaming upon them with the quiet benevolence of a\r\ngood heart, and to hear the fatherly and neighborly talks he makes\r\nto them, would be a picture and preaching which might be commended\r\nto the farmers of all countries.\r\n\r\nI saw also a curious phenomenon in the natural world on this farm,\r\nwhich perhaps will be regarded as a fiction of fancy by many a\r\nreader.  It was a large field of barley grown from _oats_!  We have\r\nrecently dwelt upon some of the co-workings of Nature and Art in the\r\ndevelopment of flowers and of several useful plants.  But here is\r\nsomething stranger still, that seems to diverge from the line of any\r\nlaw hitherto known in the vegetable world.  Still, for aught one can\r\nknow at this stage of its action, it may be the same general law of\r\ndevelopment which we have noticed, only carried forward to a more\r\nadvanced point of progress.  I would commend it to the deep and\r\nserious study of naturalists, botanists, or to those philosophers\r\nwho should preside over the department of investigation to which the\r\nsubject legitimately belongs.  I will only say what I saw with my\r\nown eyes and heard with my own ears.  Here, I repeat, was a large\r\nfield of heavy grain, ready for harvest.  The head and berry were\r\n_barley_, and the stalk and leaves were _oat_!  Here, certainly, is\r\na mystery.  The barley sown on this field was the first-born\r\noffspring of oats.  And the whole process by which this wonderful\r\ntransformation is wrought, is simply this, and nothing more:--The\r\noats are sown about the last week in June; and, before coming into\r\near, they are cut down within one inch and a half of the ground.\r\nThis operation is repeated a second time.  They are then allowed to\r\nstand through the winter, and the following season the produce is\r\n_barley_.  This is the plain statement of the case in the very words\r\nof the originator of this process, and of this strange\r\ntransmutation.  The only practical result of it which he claims is\r\nthis:  that the straw of the barley thus produced is stouter, and\r\nstands more erect, and, therefore, less liable to be beaten down by\r\nheavy wind or rain.  Then, perhaps, it may be added, this oat straw\r\nheaded with barley is more valuable as fodder for live stock than\r\nthe natural barley straw.  But the value of this result is nothing\r\ncompared with the issue of the experiment as proving the existence\r\nof a principle or law hitherto undiscovered, which may be applied to\r\nall kinds of plants for the use of man and beast.  If any English\r\nreader of these notes is disposed to inquire more fully into this\r\nsubject, I am sure he may apply without hesitation to Mr. John\r\nEkins, of Bruntisham, near St. Ives, who will supply any additional\r\ninformation needed.  He presented me with a little sample bag of\r\nthis oat-born barley, which I hope to show my agricultural neighbors\r\non returning to America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILLER OF HOUGHTON--AN HOUR IN HUNTINGDON--OLD HOUSES--\r\nWHITEWASHED TAPESTRY AND WORKS OF ART--\"THE OLD MERMAID\" AND \"THE\r\nGREEN MAN\"--TALK WITH AGRICULTURAL LABORERS--THOUGHTS ON THEIR\r\nCONDITION, PROSPECTS, AND POSSIBILITIES.\r\n\r\nAfter a little more than a week's visit in St. Ives and neighboring\r\nvillages, I again resumed my staff and set out in a westerly\r\ndirection, in order to avoid the flat country which lay immediately\r\nnorthward for a hundred miles and more.  Followed the north bank of\r\nthe Ouse to Huntingdon.  On the way, I stopped and dined with a\r\ngentleman in Houghton whose hospitality and good works are well\r\nknown to many Americans.  The locality mentioned is so identified\r\nwith his name, that they will understand whom I mean.  There was a\r\ngood and tender-hearted man who lived in our Boston, called Deacon\r\nGrant; and I hope he is living still.  He was so kind to everybody\r\nin trouble, and everybody in trouble went to him so spontaneously\r\nfor sympathy and relief, that no one ever thought of him as\r\nbelonging to a single religious congregation, but regarded him as\r\nDeacon of the whole of Boston--a kind of universal father, whose\r\nonly children were the orphans and the poor men's sons and daughters\r\nof the city.  The Miller of Houghton, as some of my readers will\r\nknow, is just such another man, with one slight difference, which is\r\nto his advantage, as a gift of grace.  He has all of Deacon Grant's\r\nself-diffusing life of love for his kind, generous and tender\r\ndispositions towards the poor and needy, and more than the Deacon's\r\nmeans of doing good; and, with all this, the indomitable energy and\r\nwill and even the look of Cromwell.  During my stay in the\r\nneighborhood, I was present at two large gatherings at his House of\r\nCanvas, with which he supplements his family mansion when the latter\r\nlacks the capacity of his heart in the way of accommodation.  This\r\ntent, which he erects on his lawn, will hold a large congregation;\r\nand, on both the occasions to which I refer, was well filled with\r\nmen, women, and children from afar and near.  The first was a re-\r\nunion of the Sunday-school teachers and pupils of the county, to\r\nwhom he gave a sumptuous dinner; after which followed addresses and\r\nsome business transactions of the association.  The second was the\r\nexamination of the British School of the village, founded and\r\nsupported, I believe, by himself.  At the conclusion of the\r\nexercises, which were exceedingly interesting, the whole company,\r\nyoung and old, adjourned to the lawn, where the visitors and elder\r\npeople of the place were served with tea and coffee under the tent.\r\n\r\nThen came \"The Children's Hour.\"  They were called in from their\r\ngames and romping on the lawn, and formed into a circle fifty feet\r\nin diameter.  And here and now commenced an entertainment which\r\nwould make a more interesting picture than the old Apsley House\r\nDinner.  The good deacon of the county, with several assistants,\r\nentered this charmed circle of boys and girls, all with eyes dilated\r\nand eager with expectation, and overlooked by a circular wall of\r\nelder people radiant with the spirit of the moment.  The host, in\r\nhis white hat and grey beard, led the way with a basket on his arm,\r\nfilled with little cakes, called with us gingernuts.  He was\r\nfollowed by a file of other men with baskets of nuts, apples, etc.\r\nIt was a most hilarious scene, exhilarating to all the senses to\r\nlook upon, either for young or old.  He walked around the ring with\r\na grand, Cromwellian step, sowing a pattering rain of the little\r\ncakes on the clean-shaven lawn, as a farmer would sow wheat in his\r\nfield, broadcast, in liberal handfuls.  Then followed in their order\r\nthe nut-sowers, apple-sowers, and the sowers of other goodies.  When\r\nthe baskets were emptied, the circular space enclosed was covered\r\nwith as tempting a spread of dainties as ever fascinated the eyes of\r\na crowd of little people.  For a whole minute, longer than a full\r\nhour of ordinary schoolboy enjoyments, they had to stand facing that\r\nsight, involuntarily attitudinising for the plunge.  At the end of\r\nthat long minute, the signal sounded, and, in an instant, there was\r\na scene in the ring that would have made the soberest octogenarian\r\nshake his sides with the laughter of his youth.  The encircling\r\nmultitude of youngsters darted upon the thickly-scattered delicacies\r\nlike a flock of birds upon a field of grain, with patter, twitter\r\nand flutter, and a tremor and treble of little short laughs; small,\r\neager hands trying in vain to shut fast upon a large apple and\r\nseveral ginger-nuts at one grasp; slippings and trippings, tousling\r\nof tresses and crushing of dresses; boys and girls higgledy-\r\npiggledy; caps and bonnets piggledy-higgledy; little, red-faced\r\nAlexanders looking half sad, because they had filled their small\r\npocket-worlds and both hands with apples and nuts, and had no room\r\nnor holding for more; little girls, with broken bonnet-strings, and\r\nlong, sunny hair dancing over their eyes, stretching their short\r\nfingers to grasp another goodie,--all this, with the merry\r\nexcitement of fathers and mothers, elder brothers and sisters, and\r\nother spectators, made it a scene of youthful life and delight which\r\nwould test the genius of the best painters of the age to delineate.\r\nAnd Sir Roger Coverley Cromwell, the author of all this\r\nentertainment, would make a capital figure in the group, taken just\r\nas he looked at that moment, with his face illuminated with the\r\nupshooting joy of his heart, like the clear, frosty sky of winter\r\nwith the glow and the flush of the Northern Lights.\r\n\r\nThe good Miller of Houghton, having added stone to stone until his\r\nmills can grind all the wheat the largest county can grow, has\r\nrecently handed over to his sons the great business he had built up\r\nto such magnitude, and retired, if possible, to a more active life\r\nof benevolence.  One of his late benefactions was a gift of 3,000\r\npounds, or nearly $15,000, toward the erection of an Independent\r\nChapel in St. Ives.\r\n\r\nAt Huntingdon, I took tea and spent a pleasant hour with the\r\nprincipal of a select school, kept in a large, dignified and\r\ncomfortable mansion, once occupied by the poet Cowper.  In the yard\r\nbehind the house there is a wide-spreading and prolific pear-tree\r\nplanted by his hands.  This, too, was one of the thousands of old,\r\nstately dwellings you meet with here and there, which have no\r\nbeginning nor end that you can get at.  Cowper lived and wrote in\r\nthis, for instance; but who lived in it a century before he was\r\nborn?  Who built it?  Which of the Two Roses did he mount on his\r\narms?  Or did he live and build later, and dine his townsman, the\r\ngreat Oliver, or was he loyal to the last to Charles the First?\r\nThese are questions that come up, on going over such a building, but\r\nno one can answer them, and you are left to the wisdom of limping\r\nlegends on the subject.  The present occupant has an antiquarian\r\npenchant; so, a short time after he took possession of the house, he\r\nbegan to make explorations in the walls and wainscotings, as men of\r\nthe same mind have done at Nineveh and Pompeii.  Having penetrated a\r\nthick surface of white lava, or a layer of lime, put on with a brush\r\n\"in an earlier age than ours,\" he came upon a gorgeous wall of\r\ntapestry, with inwoven figures and histories of great men and women,\r\nquite as large as life, and all of very florid complexion and\r\nluxurious costumes.  He has already exhumed a great many square\r\nyards of this picturesque fabric, wrought in by-gone ages, and is\r\ncontinuing the work with all the zest and success of a fortunate\r\narchaeologist.  Now it is altogether probable, that Cowper, as he\r\nsat in one of those rooms writing at his beautiful rhymes, had not\r\nthe slightest idea that he was surrounded by such a crowd of kings,\r\nqueens, and other great personages, barely concealed behind a thin\r\ncloud of white-wash.\r\n\r\nIt may possibly be true, that a few beautiful, fair-haired heretics\r\nin love or religion have been stone-masoned up alive in the walls of\r\nabbeys or convents.  Sir Walter Scott leaned to that belief, and\r\nperhaps had credible history for it.  But if the trowel has slain\r\nits thousands, the whitewash swab has slain its ten thousands of\r\ninnocents.  Think of the furlongs of richly-wrought tapestry, full\r\nof sacred and profane history, and the furlongs of curiously-carved\r\npanels, wainscoting, and cornice that floppy, sloppy, vandal brush\r\nof pigs' bristles and pail of diluted lime have eclipsed and\r\nobliterated for ever, and not a retributive drop of the villainous\r\nmixture has fallen into the perpetrator's eye to \"make his foul\r\nintent seem horrible!\"  Think of Christian kings of glorious memory,\r\neven Defenders of the Faith, with their fair queens, princes of the\r\nblood, and knights, noble and brave, all, in one still St.\r\nBartholomew night of that soft, thin, white flood, buried from the\r\nsight of the living as completely as the Roman sentinel at his post\r\nby the red gulf-stream of Vesuvius!  Still, we must not be too hard\r\non these seemingly barbarous transactions.  \"Not in anger, not in\r\nwrath,\" nor in foolish fancy, was that dripping brush always lifted\r\nupon these works of art.  Many a person of cultivated taste saw a\r\ntime when he could say, almost with Sancho Panza, \"blessings on the\r\nman who invented whitewash!  It covers a tapestry, a carving, or a\r\nsculpture all over like a blanket;\" like that one spoken of in\r\nMacbeth.  England is just beginning to learn what treasures of art\r\nin old mansions, churches and cathedrals were saved to the present\r\nage by a timely application of that cheap and healthy fluid.  For\r\nthere was a time when stern men of iron will arose, who had no fear\r\nof Gothic architecture, French tapestry, or Italian sculpture before\r\ntheir eyes; who treated things that had awed or dazzled the world as\r\n\"baubles\" of vanity, to be put away, as King Josiah put away from\r\nhis realm the graven images of his predecessors.  And these men\r\nthought they were doing good service to religion by pushing their\r\nbayonets at the most delicate works of the needle, pencil and\r\nchisel; ripping and slitting the most elaborately wrought tapestry,-\r\n-stabbing off the fine leaf, and vine-work from carved cornices and\r\nwainscoting, and mutilating the marble lace-work of the sculptor in\r\nthe old cathedrals.  The only way to save these choice things was to\r\nmake them suddenly take the white veil from the whitewasher's brush.\r\nThousands of them were thus preserved, and they are now being\r\nbrought forth to the light again, after having been shut away from\r\nthe eye of man for several centuries.\r\n\r\nThe school-house is still standing in Huntingdon, in good condition\r\nand busy occupation, in which Oliver Cromwell stormed the English\r\nalphabet and carried the first parallel of monosyllables at the\r\npoint of the pen.  The very form or bench of oak from which he\r\nmounted the breach is still occupied by boys of the same size and\r\nage, with the same number of inches between their feet and the floor\r\nwhich separated it from his.  Had the photographic art been\r\ndiscovered in his day, we might have had his face and form as he\r\nlooked when seated as a rosy-faced, light-haired boy in the rank and\r\nfile of the youngsters gathered within those walls.  What an\r\noverwhelming revelation it would have been to his young, honest and\r\nmerry mind, if some seer, like him who told Hazael his future, could\r\nhave given him a sudden glimpse of what he was to be and do in his\r\nmiddle manhood!\r\n\r\nAfter tea, I continued my walk westward to a small, quiet,\r\ncomfortable village, about five miles from Huntingdon, where I\r\nbecame the guest of \"The Old Mermaid,\" who extended her amphibious\r\nhospitalities to all strangers wishing bed and board for the night.\r\nBoth I received readily and greatly enjoyed under her roof,\r\nespecially the former.  Never did I occupy a bed so fringed with the\r\nfanciful artistries of dreamland.  It was close up under the\r\nthatched roof, and it was the most easy and natural thing in the\r\nworld for the fancies of the midnight hour to turn that thatching\r\ninto hair, and to cheat my willing mind with the delusion that I was\r\nsleeping with the long, soft tresses of Her Submarine Ladyship wound\r\naround my head.  It was a delightful vagary of the imagination,\r\nwhich the morning light, looking in through the little checker-work\r\nwindow, gently dispelled.\r\n\r\nThe next day I bent my course in a north-westerly direction, and\r\npassed through a very fertile and beautiful section.  The scenery\r\nwas truly delightful;--not grand nor splendid, but replete with\r\nquiet pictures that please the eye and touch the heart with a sense\r\nof gladness.  The soft mosaic work of the gently rounded hills, or\r\nfigures wrought in wheat, barley, oats, beans, turnips, and meadow\r\nand pasture land, and grouped into landscapes in endless alternation\r\nof lights and shades, and all this happy little world now veiled by\r\nthe low, summer clouds, now flooded by a sunburst between them--all\r\nthese lovely and changing sceneries made my walk like one through a\r\ncontinuous gallery of paintings.\r\n\r\nHarvesting had commenced in real earnest, and the wheat-fields were\r\nfull of reapers, some wielding the sickle, others the scythe.  When\r\nI saw men and women bending almost double to cut their sheaves close\r\nto the ground, I longed to walk through a barley-field with one of\r\nour American cradles, and show them how we do that sort of thing.\r\nAs yet I have seen no reaping machines in operation, and I doubt if\r\nthey will ever come into such extensive use here as with us, owing\r\nto the abundance of cheap labor in this country.  I saw on this\r\nday's walk the heaviest crop of wheat that I have noticed since I\r\nleft London.  It must have averaged sixty bushels to the acre for\r\nthe whole field.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon it began to rain; and I was glad to find\r\nshelter and entertainment at a comfortable village inn, under the\r\npatronage of \"The Green Man,\" perhaps a brother or near relative of\r\nMermadam my hostess that entertained me the preceding night.  It was\r\na unique old building, or rather a concrete of a great variety of\r\nbuildings devoted to a remarkable diversity of purposes, including\r\nbrewing, farming, and other occupations.  The large, low, dark\r\nkitchen was flanked by one of the old-fashioned fire-places, with\r\nspace for a large family between the jambs, and the hollow of the\r\nchimney ample enough to show one of the smaller constellations at\r\nthe top of it in a clear night.  A seat on the brick or stone floor\r\nbefore one of these kitchen fire-places is to me the focus of the\r\nhome comforts of the house, and I always make for it mechanically.\r\nAs the darkness drew on, several agricultural laborers drifted in,\r\none after the other, until the broad, deep pavement of the hearth\r\nwas lined by a row of them, quite fresh from their work.  They were\r\nquiet, sober-looking men, and they spoke with subdued voices,\r\nwithout animation or excitement, as if the fatigue of the day and\r\nthe general battle of life had softened them to a serious, pensive\r\nmood and movement.  As they sat drying their jackets around the\r\nfire, passing successive mugs of the landlord's ale from one to the\r\nother, they grew more and more conversational; and, as I put in a\r\nquestion here and there, they gave me an insight into the general\r\ncondition, aspects and prospects of their class which I had not\r\nobtained before.  They were quite free to answer any questions\r\nrelating to their domestic economy, their earnings, spendings, food,\r\ndrink, clothing, housing and fuel, also in reference to their\r\neducational and religious privileges and habits.\r\n\r\nIt was now the first week of harvest; and harvest in England, in any\r\none locality, covers the space of a full month, in ordinary weather.\r\nThen, as the season varies remarkably, so that one county is\r\nfrequently a week earlier in harvesting than that adjoining it on\r\nthe north, the work for the sickle is often prolonged from the\r\nmiddle of July to the middle of September.  This is the period of\r\ngreat expectation as well as toil for the agricultural laborers.\r\nEvery man, woman, and boy of them is all put under the stimulus of\r\nextra earnings through these important weeks.  Even the laborers\r\nhired by the year have a full month given them for harvesting forty\r\nor fifty extra shillings under this stimulus.  Nearly all the grain\r\nin England is cut for a certain stipulated sum per acre; and\r\nthousands of all ages, with sickle or scythe in hand, see the sun\r\nrise and set while they are at work in the field.  In the field they\r\ngenerally breakfast, lunch, and dine; and when it is considered\r\nthere is daylight enough for labor between half-past three in the\r\nmorning to half-past eight at night, one may easily see how many of\r\nthe twenty-four hours they may bend to their toil.  The price for\r\ncutting and binding wheat is from 10s. to 14s., or from $2 40c. to\r\n$3 36c. per acre, and 8s., or $1 92c. per acre for oats and barley.\r\nThe men who cut, bind, and shock by the acre generally have to find\r\ntheir own beer, and will earn from 24s. to 28s., or from $5 76c. to\r\n$6 72c. per week.  The regular laborers frequently let themselves to\r\ntheir employers during the harvest month at from 20s. to 24s. per\r\nweek, which is just about double their usual wages.  In addition to\r\nthis pay, they are often allowed two quarts of ale and two quarts of\r\nsmall beer per day; not the small beer of New England, made only of\r\nhops, ginger, and molasses; but a far more stimulating drink, quite\r\nequal to our German lager.  This gallon of beer will cost the farmer\r\nabout 10d., or 20c.  Where the piece-work laborer furnishes his own\r\nmalt liquor, it must cost him on an average about an English\r\nshilling, or twenty-four cents, a day.\r\n\r\nTwo or three of the men who formed the circle around the fire at The\r\nGreen Man, had come to purchase, or pay for, a keg of beer for their\r\nharvest allowance.  It was to me a matter of half-painful interest\r\nto see what vital importance they attached to a supply of this\r\nstimulant--to see how much more they leaned upon its strength and\r\ncomfort than upon food.  It was not in my heart to argue the\r\nquestion with them, or to seek to dispel the hereditary and pleasant\r\nillusion, that beer alone, of all human drinks, could carry them\r\nthrough the long, hot hours of toil in harvest.  Besides, I wished\r\nto get at their own free thoughts on the subject without putting my\r\nown in opposition to them, which might have slightly restricted\r\ntheir full expression.  Every one of them held to the belief, as put\r\nbeyond all doubt or question by the experience of the present and\r\nall past generations, that wheat, barley and oats could not be\r\nreaped and ricked without beer, and beer at the rate of a gallon a\r\nday per head.  Each had his string of proofs to this conviction\r\nterminating in a pewter mug, just as some poor people praying to the\r\nVirgin have a string of beads ending in a crucifix, which they tell\r\noff with honest hearts and sober faces.  Each could make it stand to\r\nreason that a man could not bear the heat and burden of harvest\r\nlabor without beer.  Each had his illustration in the case of some\r\npoor fellow who had tried the experiment, out of principle or\r\neconomy, and had failed under it.  It was of no use to talk of\r\ntemperance and all that.  It was all very nice for well-to-do\r\npeople, who never blistered their hands at a sickle or a scythe, to\r\ntell poor, laboring men, sweating at their hot and heavy work from\r\nsun to sun, that they must not drink anything but milk and water or\r\ncold tea and coffee, but put them in the wheat-field a few days, and\r\nlet them try their wishy-washy drinks and see what would become of\r\nthem.  As I have said, I did not undertake to argue the men out of\r\nthis belief, partly because I wished to learn from them all they\r\nthought and felt on the subject, and partly, I must confess, because\r\nI was reluctant to lay a hard hand upon a source of comfort which,\r\nto them, holds a large portion of their earthly enjoyments,\r\nespecially when I could not replace it with a substitute which they\r\nwould accept, and which would yield them an equal amount of\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nA personal habit becomes a \"second nature\" to the individual, even\r\nif he stands alone in its indulgence.  But when it is an almost\r\nuniversal habit, coming down from generation to generation, throwing\r\nits creepers and clingers around the social customs and industrial\r\neconomies of a great nation, it is almost like re-creating a world\r\nto change that second nature thus strengthened.  This change is\r\nslowly working its way in Great Britain--slowly, but perceptibly\r\nhere and there--thanks to the faithful and persevering efforts put\r\nforth by good and true men, to enlighten the subjects of this\r\nimpoverishing and demoralising custom, which has ruled with such\r\ndespotism over the laborers of the land.  Little by little the\r\nproper balance between the Four Great Powers of human necessity,--\r\nFood, Drink, Raiment and Housing, so long disturbed by this habit,\r\nis being restored.  Still, the preponderance of Drink, especially\r\namong the agricultural laborers in England, is very striking and\r\nsad.  As a whole, Beer must still stand before Bread--even before\r\nMeat, and before both in many cases, in their expenditures.  The man\r\nwho sat next me, in muddy leggings, and smoking coat, was mildly\r\nspoken, quiet, and seemingly thoughtful.  He had come for his\r\nharvest allowance of 20s. worth of beer.  If he abstained from its\r\nuse on Sundays, he would have a ration of about tenpence's worth\r\ndaily.  That would buy him a large loaf of bread, two good cuts of\r\nmutton or beef, and all the potatoes and other vegetables he could\r\neat in a day.  But he puts it all into the Jug instead of the\r\nBasket.  Jug is the juggernaut that crushes his hard earnings in the\r\ndust, or, without the figure, distils them into drink.  Jug swallows\r\nup the first fruits of his industry, and leaves Basket to glean\r\namong the sharpest thorns of his poverty.  Jug is capricious as well\r\nas capacious.  It clamors for quality as well as quantity; it is\r\ngreedy of foaming and beaded liquors.  Basket does well if it can\r\nbring to the reaper the food of well-kept dogs.  In visiting\r\ndifferent farms, I have noticed men and women at their luncheons and\r\ndinners in the field.  A hot mutton chop, or a cut of roast-beef,\r\nand a hot potato, seem to be a luxury they never think of in the\r\nhardest toil of harvest.  Both the meals I have mentioned consist,\r\nso far as I have seen, of only two articles of food,--bread and\r\nbacon, or bread and cheese.  And this bacon is never warm, but laid\r\nupon a slice of bread in a thin, cold layer, instead of butter, both\r\nbeing cut down through with a jack-knife into morsels when eaten.\r\n\r\nSuch is a habit that devours a lion's share of the English laborer's\r\nearnings, and leaves Food, Raiment, and Housing to shift for\r\nthemselves.  If he works by the piece and finds his own beer, it\r\ncosts him more than he pays for house rent, or for bread, or meat,\r\nor for clothes for himself and family.  If his employer furnishes it\r\nor pays him commutation money, it amounts for all his men to a tax\r\nof half-a-crown to the acre for his whole farm.  There is no earthly\r\nreason why agricultural laborers in this country should spend more\r\nin drink than those of New England.  I am confident that if a census\r\nwere taken of all the \"hired men\" of our six states, and a fair\r\naverage struck, the daily expenditure for drinks would not exceed\r\ntwopence, or four cents per head, while their average wages would\r\namount to 4s., or 96 cents, per day through the year.  Yet our\r\nSummers are far hotter and dryer than in England, our labor equally\r\nhard, and there is really more natural occasion for drinks in our\r\nharvest fields than here.  It would require a severe apprenticeship\r\nfor our men to acquire a taste for sharp ale or strong beer as a\r\nbeverage under our July sun.  A pail or jug of sweetened water,\r\nperhaps with a few drops of cider to the pint, to sour it slightly,\r\nand a spoonful of ginger stirred in, is our substitute for malt\r\nliquor.  Sometimes beer made of nothing but hops, water, and a\r\nlittle molasses, is brought into the field, and makes even an\r\nexhilarating drink, without any alcoholic effect.  Cold coffee,\r\ndiluted with water, and re-sweetened, is a healthful and grateful\r\nluxury to our farm laborers.\r\n\r\nIt would be a blessed thing for all the outdoor and indoor laborers\r\nin this country, if the broad chasm between the strong beer of Old\r\nEngland and the small beer of New England could be bridged, and they\r\nbe carried across to the shore of a better habit.  The farm hands\r\nhere need a good deal of gentle leading and suggestion in this\r\nmatter.  If some humane and ingenious man would get up a new, cheap,\r\ncold drink, which should be nutritious, palatable and exhilarating,\r\nwithout any inebriating property, it would be a boon of immeasurable\r\nvalue.  Malt liquors are made in such rivers here, or rather in such\r\nlakes with river outlets; there is such a system for their\r\ndistribution and circulation through every town, village, and\r\nhamlet; and they are so temptingly and conveniently kegged, bottled,\r\nand jugged, and so handy to be carried out into the field, that the\r\nhabit of drinking them is almost forced upon the poor man's lips.\r\nIf a cheaper drink, refreshing and strengthening, could be made\r\nequally convenient and attractive, it would greatly help to break\r\nthis hereditary thraldom to the Beer-Barrel.  Another powerful\r\nauxiliary to this good work might be contributed in the form of a\r\nsimple contrivance, which any man of mechanical genius and a kind\r\nheart might elaborate.  In this go-ahead age, scores of things are\r\nmade portable that once were fast-anchored solidities.  We have\r\nportable houses, portable beds, portable stoves and cooking ranges,\r\nas well as portable steam-engines.  Now, if some benevolent and\r\ningenious man would get up a little portable affair, at the cost of\r\ntwo or three shillings, especially for agricultural laborers in this\r\ncountry, which they could carry with one hand into the field, and by\r\nwhich they could make and keep hot a pot of coffee, cocoa,\r\nchocolate, broth or porridge, and also bake a piece of meat and a\r\nfew potatoes, it would be a real benefaction to thousands, and help\r\nthem up to the high road of a better condition.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best condition to which the agricultural laborers in\r\nGreat Britain may ever expect to attain, or to which they may be\r\nraised by that benevolent effort now put forth for their elevation?\r\nThey may all be taught to read and write and do a little in the\r\nfirst three rules of arithmetic.  That will raise them to a new\r\nstatus and condition.  Education of the masses has become such a\r\nvigorous idea with the Government and people of England; so much is\r\ndoing to make the children of the manufacturing districts pass\r\nthrough the school-room into the factory, carrying with them the\r\nability and taste for reading; ragged schools, working-men's clubs,\r\nand institutions for all kinds of cheap learning and gratuitous\r\nteaching are multiplying so rapidly; the press is turning out such a\r\nworld of literature for the homes of the poor, and the English Post,\r\nlike a beneficent Providence, is distilling such a morning dew of\r\nmanuscript and printed thoughts over the whole length and breadth of\r\nthe country, and all these streams of elevating influence are now so\r\ntending towards the agricultural laborers, that there is good reason\r\nto believe the next generation of them will stand head and shoulders\r\nabove any preceding one in the stature of intelligence and self-\r\nrespect.  This in itself will give them a new status in society, as\r\nbeneficial to their employers as to themselves.  It will increase\r\ntheir mutual respect, and create a better footing for their\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\nBut the first improvement demanded in their condition, and the most\r\npressingly urgent, is a more comfortable, decent and healthy\r\nhousing.  Until this is effected, all other efforts to raise them\r\nmentally and morally must fail of their expected result.  The London\r\nTimes, and other metropolitan, and many local, journals publish\r\nalmost daily distressing accounts of the miserable tenements\r\noccupied by the men and women whose labor makes England the garden\r\nof fertility and beauty that it is.  Editors are making the subject\r\nthe theme of able and stirring articles, and some of the most\r\neloquent members of Parliament are speaking of it with great power.\r\nIt is not only generous but just to take the language in which the\r\nwriters and orators of a country denounce the evils existing in it\r\ncum grano salis, or with considerable allowance for exaggeration.\r\nTheir statements and denunciations should not be used against their\r\ncountry as a reproach by the people of another, because they prove\r\nan earnest desire and effort to reform abuses which grew up in an\r\nunenlightened past.  As a specimen of the language which is\r\nsometimes held on this subject, I subjoin the following paragraph\r\nfrom the Saturday Review, perhaps the most cynical or unsentimental\r\njournal in England:--\r\n\r\n\"There is a wailing for the dirt and vice and misery which must\r\nprevail in houses where seven or eight persons, of both sexes and\r\nall ages, are penned up together for the night in the one rickety,\r\nfoul, vermin-hunted bed-room.  The picture of agricultural life\r\nunrolls itself before us as it is painted by those who know it best.\r\nWe see the dull, clouded mind, the bovine gaze, the brutality and\r\nrecklessness, and the simple audacity, and the confessed hatred of\r\nhis betters, which mark the English peasant, unless some happy\r\nfortune has saved him from the general lot, and persuaded him that\r\nlife has something besides beer that the poor man may have and may\r\nrelish.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is a sad picture truly.  The pen is sharp and cuts like a\r\nknife,--but it is the surgeon's knife, not the poisoned barb of a\r\nforeigner's taunt.  This is the hopeful and promising aspect of\r\nthese delineations and denunciations of the laboring man's\r\ncondition.  That low, damp, ill-ventilated, contracted room in which\r\nhe pens his family at night, was, quite likely, constructed in the\r\ndays of Good Queen Bess, or when \"George the Third was King,\" at the\r\nlatest.  And houses were built for good, substantial farmers in\r\nthose days which they would hardly house their horses in now.  There\r\nare hundreds of mechanics and day-laborers in Edinburgh who pen\r\ntheir families nightly in apartments once owned and occupied by\r\nScotch dukes and earls, but which a journeyman shoemaker of New\r\nEngland would be loth to live in rent free.  Even the favorite room\r\nof Queen Mary, in Holyrood Palace, in which she was wont to tea and\r\ntalk with Rizzio, would be too small and dim for the shop-parlor of\r\na small London tradesman of the present day.  Thus, after all, the\r\nlow-jointed, low-floored, small-windowed, ill-ventilated cottages\r\nnow occupied by the agricultural laborers of England were\r\nproportionately as good as the houses built at the same period for\r\nthe farmers of the country, many of which are occupied by farmers\r\nnow, and the like of which never could be erected again on this\r\nisland.  Indeed, one wonders at finding so many of these old farm\r\nhouses still inhabited by well-to-do people, who could well afford\r\nto live in better buildings.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is a hopeful sign, and both pledge and proof of\r\nprogress--that the very cottages of laboring men in England that\r\nonce figured so poetically in the histories and pictures of rural\r\nlife, are now being turned inside out to the scrutiny of a more\r\nenlightened and benevolent age, revealing conditions that stir up\r\nthe whole community to painful sensibility and to vigorous efforts\r\nto improve them.  These cottages were just as low, damp, small and\r\ndirty thirty years ago as they are now, and the families \"penned\" in\r\nthem at night were doubtless as large, and perhaps more ignorant\r\nthan those which inhabit them at the present time.  It is not the\r\nreal difference between the actual conditions of the two periods but\r\nthe difference in the dispositions and perceptions of the public\r\nmind, that has produced these humane sensibilities and efforts for\r\nthe elevation of the ploughers, sowers, reapers and mowers who\r\nenrich and beautify this favored land with their patient and poorly-\r\npaid labor.  And there is no doubt that these newly-awakened\r\nsentiments and benevolent activities will carry the day; replacing\r\nthe present tenements of the agricultural laborers with comfortable,\r\nwell-built cottages, fitted for the homes of intelligent and\r\nvirtuous families.  This work has commenced in different sections\r\nunder favorable auspices.  Buildings have been erected on an estate\r\nhere and there which will be likely to serve as models for whole\r\nhamlets of new tenements.  From what I have heard, I should think\r\nthat Lord Overstone, of the great banking house of the Lloyds, has\r\nproduced the best models for cottage homes, on his estates in\r\nNorthamptonshire.  Although built after the most modern and improved\r\nplan, and capacious enough to accommodate a considerable family very\r\ncomfortably, almost elegantly, the yearly rent is only 3 pounds, or\r\nless than _fifteen dollars_!\r\n\r\nNow with a three-pound cottage, having a parlor, kitchen, bed-room\r\nand buttery on the lower floor, and an equal number of apartments on\r\nthe upper; with a forty-rod garden to grow his vegetables, and with\r\na free school for his children at easy walking distance, the\r\nagricultural laborer in England will be placed as far forward on the\r\nroad of improvement as the Government or people, or both, can set\r\nhim.  The rest of the way upward and onward he must make by his own\r\nindustry, virtue and economy.  From this point he must work out his\r\nown progress and elevation.  No Government, nor any benevolent\r\nassociation, nor general nor private benevolence, can regulate the\r\nrate of his wages.  The labor market will determine that, just as\r\nthe Corn Exchange does the price of wheat.  But there is one thing\r\nhe can do to raise himself in civil stature, moral growth, and\r\ndomestic comfort.  He may empty the Jug into the Basket.  He and his\r\nfamily may consume in solids what they now do in frothy fluids.\r\nThey may exchange their scanty dinner of cold bacon and bread for\r\none of roast beef and plum pudding, by substituting cold coffee,\r\ncocoa or pure water for strong beer.  Or, if they are content to go\r\non with their old fare of food, they may save the money they\r\nexpended in ale for the rent of one or two acres of land, for a cow,\r\nor for two or three pigs, or deposit it weekly in the Post-Office\r\nSavings' Bank, until it shall amount to a sum sufficient to enable\r\nthem to set up a little independent business of their own.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are three great steps indispensable for the elevation of\r\nthe agricultural laborers of Great Britain to the highest level in\r\nsociety which they can reach and maintain.  Two of these the\r\nGovernment, or the land-owners, or both, must take.  They are\r\nImproved Dwellings and Free and Accessible Education.  These the\r\nlaborer cannot provide for himself and family.  It is utterly beyond\r\nhis ability to do it.  The third, last, long step must depend\r\nentirely upon himself; though he may be helped on by sympathy,\r\nsuggestion, and encouragement from those who know how hard a thing\r\nit is for the fixed appetites to break through the meshes of habit.\r\nHe must make drink the cheapest of human necessities.  He must\r\nexchange Beer for Bread, for clothes, for books, or for things that\r\ngive permanent comfort and enjoyment.  When these three steps are\r\naccomplished, the British laborer will stand before his country in\r\nthe best position it can give him.  And I believe it will be a\r\nposition which will make him contented and happy, and be\r\nsatisfactory to all classes of the people.\r\n\r\nAfter all that can be done for them, the wages of the agricultural\r\nlaborers of Great Britain cannot be expected to exceed, on an\r\naverage, twelve shillings a week, or about half the price of the\r\nsame labor in America.  Their rent and clothes cost them, perhaps,\r\nless than half the sum paid by our farm hands for the same items of\r\nexpenditure.  Their food must also cost only about half of what our\r\nmen pay, who would think they were poor indeed if they could not\r\nhave hot meat breakfasts, roast or boiled beef dinners and cold meat\r\nsuppers, with the usual sprinkling of puddings, pies, and cakes, and\r\ntea sweetened with loaf sugar.  Thus, after all, put the English\r\nlaborer in the position suggested; give him such a three-pound\r\ncottage and garden as Lord Overstone provides; give his children\r\nfree and convenient schooling; then let him exchange his ale for\r\nnutritious and almost costless drinks, and if he is still able to\r\nlive for a few years on his old food-fare, he may work his way up to\r\na very comfortable condition with his twelve shillings a week,\r\nbesides his beer-money.  On these conditions he would be able almost\r\nto run neck and neck with our hired men in the matter of saving\r\nmoney \"for a rainy day,\" or for raising himself to a higher\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWe will put them side by side, after the suggested improvements have\r\nbeen realised; assuming each has a wife, with two children too young\r\nto earn anything at field work.\r\n\r\nAmerican Laborer at 24s per week       English Laborer, at 12s per\r\nweek\r\n\r\nWeekly Expense     $  c.   s. d        Weekly Expense     s. d.  $ c\r\nfor:--                                 for:--\r\n-------------------------------        ----------------------------\r\nFood               3 50 = 14  7        Food               7  3 = 1\r\n75\r\nRent and Taxes     0 67 =  2  9        Rent               1  2 = O\r\n28\r\nFuel, average of\r\n     the year      O 48 =  2  O        For Fuel           1  O = O\r\n24\r\nFor Clothes        1  0 =  4  2        For Clothes        2  1 = 0\r\n50\r\n\r\nTotal Weekly                           Total Weekly\r\n   Expenses       --------------          Expenses       -----------\r\n--\r\n                   5 65 = 23  6                          11  6 = 2\r\n77\r\n                  --------------                         -----------\r\n--\r\n\r\nI think the American reader, who is personally acquainted with the\r\nhabits and domestic economy of our farm laborers, will regard this\r\nestimate of their expenditures as quite moderate.  I have assumed,\r\nin both cases, that no time is lost in the week on account of\r\nsickness, or of weather, or lack of employment; and all the\r\nincidental expenses I have included in the four general items given.\r\nIt must also be conceded that our farm hands do not average more\r\nthan twenty-four English shillings, or $5 75c., per week, through\r\nall the seasons of the year.  The amount of expenditure allowed in\r\nthe foregoing estimate enables them to support themselves and their\r\nfamilies comfortably, if they are temperate and industrious; to\r\nclothe and educate their children; to make bright and pleasant\r\nhomes, with well-spread tables, and to have respectable seats in\r\nchurch on the Sabbath.  On the other hand, we have assigned to the\r\nEnglish agricultural laborer what he would regard a proportionately\r\ncomfortable allowance for the wants of a week.  We may not have\r\ndivided it correctly, but the total of the items is as great as he\r\nwould expect to expend on the current necessities of seven days.  I\r\ndoubt if one in a thousand of the farm laborers of Great Britain\r\nlays out more than the sum we have allotted for one week's food,\r\nrent, and fuel and clothes.  We then reach this result of the\r\nbalance-sheet of the two men.  Their weekly savings hardly differ by\r\na penny; each amounting to about 5d., or 10 cents.  At first sight,\r\nit might seem, from this result, that the English farm laborer earns\r\nhalf as much, lives half as well, and saves as much as the American.\r\nBut he has a resource for increasing his weekly savings which his\r\nAmerican competitor would work his fingers to the bone before he\r\nwould employ.  His wife is able and willing to go with him into the\r\nfield and earn from three to five shillings a week.  Then, if he\r\ncommutes with his employer, he will receive from him 4d. daily, or\r\n2s. a week, for beer-money.  Thus, if he and his wife are willing to\r\nlive, as such families do now, on bread, bacon and cheese, and such\r\nvegetables as they can grow in their garden, they may lay up, from\r\ntheir joint earnings, a dollar, or four shillings a week, provided a\r\nsufficiently stimulating object be set before them.  To me it is\r\nsurprising that they sustain so much human life on such small means.\r\nThey are often reproached for their want of wise economy; but never\r\nwas more keen ingenuity, more close balancing of pennies against\r\nprovisions than a great many of them practice and teach.  Let the\r\nmost astute or utilitarian of social economists try the experiment\r\nof housing, feeding and clothing himself, wife and six children too\r\nyoung to earn anything, on ten or twelve shillings a week; and he\r\nwill learn something that his philosophy never dreamed of.\r\n\r\nEven while bending under the weight of the beer-barrel, thousands of\r\nagricultural laborers in England have accomplished wonders by their\r\nindefatigable industry, integrity and economy.  Put a future before\r\nthem with a sun in it--some object they may reach that is worth a\r\nlife's effort, and as large a proportion of them will work for it as\r\nyou will find in any other country.  A servant girl told me recently\r\nthat her father was a Devonshire laborer, who worked the best years\r\nof his life for seven shillings a week, and her mother for three,\r\nwhen they had half a dozen children to feed and clothe.  Yet, by\r\nthat unflagging industry and ingenious economy with which thousands\r\nwrestle with the necessities of such a life and throw them, too,\r\nthey put saving to saving, until they were able to rent an acre of\r\norcharding, a large garden for vegetables, then buy a donkey and\r\ncart, then a pony and cart, and load and drive them both to market\r\nwith their own and their neighbors' produce, starting from home at\r\ntwo in the morning.  In a few years they were able to open a little\r\ngrocery and provision shop, and are now taking their rank among the\r\ntradespeople of the village.  But if the farm servants of England\r\ncould only be induced to give up beer and lay by the money paid them\r\nas a substitute, it alone would raise them to a new condition of\r\ncomfort, even independence.  At 4d. a day commutation money, they\r\nwould have each 5 pounds at the end of the year.  That would pay the\r\nrent of two acres of land here; or it would buy five on the Illinois\r\nCentral Railroad.  Three years' beer-money would pay for those rich\r\nprairie acres, his fare by sea and land to them, and leave him 3\r\npounds in his pocket to begin their cultivation with.  Three years\r\nof this saving would make almost a new man of him at home, in the\r\nway of self-respect, comfort and progress.  It would be a \"nest-\r\negg,\" to which hope, habit and a strengthening ambition would add\r\nothers of larger size and value from year to year.\r\n\r\nGive, then, the British agricultural laborer good, healthy Housing,\r\nFree Schooling, and let him empty the Jug into the Basket, and he\r\nmay work his way up to a very comfortable condition at home.  But if\r\nhe should prefer to go to Australia or America, where land is cheap\r\nand labor dear, in a few years he may save enough to take him to\r\neither continent, with sufficient left in his pocket to begin life\r\nin a new world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM GAME--HALLETT WHEAT--OUNDLE--COUNTRY BRIDGES--FOTHERINGAY\r\nCASTLE--QUEEN MARY'S IMPRISONMENT AND EXECUTION--BURGHLEY HOUSE:\r\nTHE PARK, AVENUES, ELMS, AND OAKS--THOUGHTS ON TREES, ENGLISH AND\r\nAMERICAN.\r\n\r\nHaving now pursued a westerly direction until I was in the range of\r\na continuous upland section of country, I took a northward course\r\nand walked on to Oundle, a goodly town in Northamptonshire, as\r\nunique as its name.  On the way, in crossing over to another\r\nturnpike road, I passed through a large tract of land in a very\r\ndeshabille condition, rough, boggy and bushy.  I soon found it was a\r\ngame-growing estate, and very productive of all sorts of birds and\r\nsmall quadrupeds.  The fields I crossed showed a promising crop of\r\nhares and rabbits; and doubtless there were more partridges on that\r\nsquare mile than in the whole State of Connecticut.  This is a\r\ncharacteristic of the country which will strike an American, at his\r\nfirst visit, with wonder.  He will see hares and rabbits bobbing\r\nabout on common farms, and partridges in broods, like separate\r\nflocks of hens and chickens, in fields of grain, within a stone's\r\nthrow of the farmer's house.  I doubt if any county in New England\r\nproduces so many in a year as the holding of Mr. Samuel Jonas\r\nalready described.  Rabbits have been put out of the pale of\r\nprotection somewhat recently, I believe, and branded with the bad\r\nname of _vermin_; so that the tenant farmer may kill them on his\r\noccupation without leave or license from the landlord.  It may\r\nindicate their number to state the fact, that one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five head of them were killed in one day's shooting on Mr.\r\nJonas's estate by his sons and some of their friends.\r\n\r\nIt was market day in Oundle, and I had the pleasure of sitting down\r\nto dinner with a large company of farmers and cattle and corn-\r\ndealers.  They were intelligent, substantial-looking men, with no\r\noccupational peculiarity of dress or language to distinguish them\r\nfrom ordinary middle-class gentlemen engaged in trade or\r\nmanufacture.  Indeed, the old-fashioned English farmer, of the\r\ngreat, round, purply-red face, aldermanic stature, and costume of\r\nfifty years ago, speaking the dialect of his county with such\r\ninimitable accent, is fast going out.  I have not seen one during my\r\npresent sojourn in England.  I fear he has disappeared altogether\r\nwith the old stage-coach, and that we have not pictures enough of\r\nhim left to give the rising generation any correct notion of what he\r\nwas, and how he looked.  It may be a proper and utilitarian change,\r\nbut one can hardly notice without regret what transformations the\r\nrailway regime has wrought in customs and habits which once\r\nindividualised a country and people.  A kind of French\r\ncentralisation in the world of fashion has been established, which\r\nhas over-ridden and obliterated all the dress boundaries of\r\ncivilised nations.  All the upper and middle classes of Christendom\r\ncentre themselves to one focus of taste and merge into one plastic\r\ncommonwealth, to be shaped and moulded virtually by a common tailor.\r\nTheir coats, vests, pantaloons, boots and shoes are made\r\nsubstantially after the same pattern.  For a while, hats stood out\r\nwith some show of pluck and patriotism, and made a stand for\r\nnational individuality, but it was in vain.  They, too, succumbed to\r\nthe inexorable law of Uniformity.  That law was liberal in one\r\nrespect.  It did not insist that the stove-pipe form should rule\r\ninflexibly.  It admitted several variations, including wide-awakes,\r\npliable felts, and that little, squat, lackadaisical, round-crown,\r\nnarrow-brimmed thing worn by the Prince of Wales in the photographs\r\ntaken of him and the Princess at Sandringham.  But this has come to\r\nbe the rule:  that hats shall no longer represent distinct\r\nnationalities; that they shall be interchangeable in all civilised\r\ncommunities; in a word, that neither Englishman, American, French\r\nnor German shall be known by his hat, whatever be the form or\r\nmaterial of its body or brim.  If there were a southern county in\r\nEngland where the mercury stood at 100 degrees in the shade for two\r\nor three summer months, the upper classes in it would don, without\r\nany hesitation, the wide, flappy broadbrims of California, and still\r\nbe in the fashion,--that is, variety in uniformity.  The peasantry,\r\nor the lowest laboring classes of European countries, are now, and\r\nwill remain perhaps for a century to come, the only conservators of\r\nthe distinctive national costumes of bygone generations.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation at the table, a farmer exhibited a head of\r\nthe Hallett wheat, which he had grown on his land.  I never saw\r\nanything to equal it, in any country in which I have travelled.  It\r\nwas nearly six inches in length, and seeded large and plump from top\r\nto bottom.  This is a variety produced by Mr. Hallett, of Brighton,\r\nand is creating no little interest among English grain-growers.\r\nLord Burghley, who had tested its properties, thus describes it, in\r\na speech before the Northamptonshire Agricultural Society last\r\nsummer:--\r\n\r\n\"At the Battersea Show last year, my attention was called to some\r\nenormous ears of wheat, which I thought could not have been grown in\r\nEngland.  For, although the British farmer can grow corn with\r\nanyone, I had never seen such wheat here, and thought it must be\r\nforeign wheat.  I went to the person who was threshing some out, and\r\nhaving been informed that it was sown only with one seed in a hole,\r\nI procured some of Mr. Hallett, of Brighton; and, being anxious to\r\ntry the system, I planted it according to Mr. Hallett's directions--\r\none grain in a hole, the holes nine and a half inches apart, with\r\nsix inches between the rows.  To satisfy myself on the subject, I\r\nalso planted some according to Stephen's instructions, who said\r\nthree grains in a hole would produce the most profitable return.  I\r\nalso planted some two grains in a hole.  I sowed the grain at the\r\nend of last September, on bad land, over an old quarry, and except\r\nsome stiff clay at the bottom of it, there was nothing in it good\r\nfor wheat.  The other day I counted the stalks of all three.  On Mr.\r\nStephen's plan of three grains in a hole, there were eighteen\r\nstalks; with two grains in a hole, there was about the same number;\r\nbut with one seed in a hole, the lowest number of stalks was\r\nsixteen, and the highest twenty-two.  I planted only about half an\r\nacre as a trial, and when I left home a few days since, it looked as\r\nmuch like eight quarters (sixty-four bushels) to the acre as any I\r\nhave seen.  The ears are something enormous.  I would certainly\r\nrecommend every farmer to make his own experiments, for if it\r\nsucceeds, it will prove a great economy of seed; and drills to\r\ndistribute it fairly are to be had.\"\r\n\r\nTruly one of Hallett's wheat ears might displace the old cornucopia\r\nin that picture of happy abundance so familiar to old and young.\r\nHere are twenty ears from one seed, containing probably a thousand\r\ngrains.  The increase of a thousand-fold, or half that ratio, is\r\nprodigious, having nothing to equal it in the vegetable world that\r\nwe know of.  If one bushel of seed wheat could be so distributed by\r\na drill as to produce 500 or 250 bushels at the harvest, certainly\r\nthe staff of life would be greatly cheapened to the millions who\r\nlean upon it alone for subsistence.\r\n\r\nFrom Oundle I walked the next day to Stamford, a good, solid, old\r\nEnglish town, sitting on the corners of three counties, and on three\r\nlayers of history, Saxon, Dane and Norman.  The first object of\r\ninterest was a stone bridge over the Nen at Oundle.  It is a grand\r\nstructure to span such a little river.  It must have cost three\r\ntimes as much as \"The Great Bridge\" over the Connecticut at\r\nHartford; and yet the stream it crosses is a mere rivulet compared\r\nwith our New England river.  \"The bridge with wooden piers\" is a\r\nfabric of fancy to most English people.  They have read of such a\r\nthing in Longfellow's poems, but hardly realise that it exists still\r\nin civilised countries.  Here bridges are works of art as well as of\r\nutility, and rank next to the grand old cathedrals and parish\r\nchurches for solidity and symmetry.  Their stone arches are\r\nfrequently turned with a grace as fine as any in St. Paul's, and\r\ntheir balustrades and butments often approach the domain of\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Nen, I followed it for several miles in a northerly\r\ndirection.  I soon came to a rather low, level section of the road,\r\nand noticed stones placed at the side of it, at narrow intervals,\r\nfor a long distance to the very foot of a village situated on a\r\nrising ground.  These stones were evidently taken from some ancient\r\nedifice, for many of them bore the marks of the old cathedral or\r\ncastle chisel.  They were the foot-tracks of a ruined monument of\r\ndark and painful history.  More than this might be said of them.\r\nThey were the blood-drops of a monstrosity chased from its den and\r\nhunted down by the people, who shuddered with horror at its\r\nsanguinary record of violence and wrong.  As I approached the quiet\r\nvillage, whose pleasant-faced houses, great and small, looked like a\r\ncongregation of old and young sitting reverently around the parish\r\nchurch and listening to the preaching of the belfry, I saw where\r\nthese stones came from.  There, on that green, ridgy slope, where\r\nthe lambs lay in the sun by the river, these stones, and a million\r\nmore scattered hither and thither, once stood in walls high, hideous\r\nand wrathful, for half a dozen centuries and more.  If the\r\nbreathings of human woe, if the midnight misery of wretched, broken\r\nhearts, could have penetrated these stones, one might almost fancy\r\nthat they would have sweat with human histories in the ditch where\r\nthey lay, and discolored the puddles they bridged with the bitter\r\ndistilment of grief centuries old.  On that gentle rising from the\r\nlittle Nen stood Fotheringay Castle.  That central depression among\r\nthe soft-carpeted ridges marks the site of the donjon huge and\r\nhorrid, where many a knight and lady of noble blood was pinioned or\r\npenned in darkness and hopeless duress centuries before the\r\nunfortunate Mary was born.  There nearly half the sad years of her\r\nyoung life and beauty were prisoned.  There she pined in the\r\nsickness of hope deferred, in the corroding anguish of dread\r\nuncertainty, for a space as wide as that between the baptismal font\r\nand presentation at Elizabeth's court.  There she laid her white\r\nneck upon the block.  There fell the broad axe of Elizabeth's envy,\r\nfear and hate.  There fell the fair-haired head that once gilded a\r\ncrown and wore all the glory of regal courts--still beautiful in the\r\nsetting light of farewell thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt may be truly said of Fotheringay Castle, that not one stone is\r\nleft upon another to mark its foundations.  Not Fleet-street Prison,\r\nnor the Bastille itself, went out under a heavier weight of popular\r\nodium.  Although public sentiment, as well as the personal taste and\r\ninterest of their proprietors, has favored the preservation of the\r\nruins of old castles and abbeys in Great Britain, Fotheringay bore,\r\nbranded deep in its forehead, the mark of Cain, and every man's\r\nhand, of the last generation, seemed to have been turned against it.\r\nIt has not only been demolished, but the debris have been scattered\r\nfar and wide, and devoted to uses which they scarcely honor.  You\r\nwill see the well-faced stones for miles around, in garden walls,\r\npavements, cottage hearths and chimneys, in stables and cow-houses.\r\nIn Oundle, the principal hotel, a large castellated building, shows\r\nits whole front built of them.\r\n\r\nThe great lion of Stamford is the Burghley House, the palace of the\r\nMarquis of Exeter.  It may be called so without exaggeration of its\r\nmagnificence as a building or of the extent and grandeur of its\r\nsurroundings.  The edifice itself would cut up into nearly half a\r\ndozen \"White Houses,\" such as we install our American Presidents in\r\nat Washington.  Certainly, in any point of view, it is large and\r\nsplendid enough for the residence of an emperor and his suite.  Its\r\ntowers, turrets and spires present a picturesque grove of\r\narchitecture of different ages, and its windows, it is said, equal\r\nin number all the days of the year.  It was not open to the public\r\nthe day I was in Stamford, so I could only walk around it and\r\nestimate its interior by its external grandeur.\r\n\r\nBut there was an outside world of architecture in the park of\r\nsublimer features to me than even the great palace itself, with all\r\nits ornate and elaborate sculpture.  It was the architecture of the\r\nmajestic elms and oaks that stood in long ranks and folded their\r\nhands, high up in the blue sky, above the finely-gravelled walks\r\nthat radiated outward in different directions.  They all wore the\r\nangles and arches of the Gothic order and the imperial belt of\r\nseveral centuries.  I walked down one long avenue and counted them\r\non either side.  There were not sixty on both; yet their green and\r\ngraceful roofage reached a full third of a mile.  Not sixty to\r\npillar and turn such an arch as that!  I sat down on a seat at the\r\nend to think of it.  There was a morning service going on in this\r\nCathedral of Nature.  The dew-moistened, foliated arches so lofty,\r\nso interwebbed with wavy, waky spangles of sky, were all set to the\r\nmusic of the anthem.  \"The street musicians of the heavenly city\"\r\nwere singing one of its happiest hymns out of their mellow throats.\r\nThe long and lofty orchestra was full of them.  Their twittering\r\ntreble shook the leaves with its breath, as it filtered down and\r\nflooded the temple below.  Beautiful is this building of God!\r\nBeautiful and blessed are these morning singing-birds of His praise!\r\nAmen!\r\n\r\nBut do not go yet.  No; I will not.  Here is the only book I carry\r\nwith me on this walk--a Hebrew Psalter, stowed away in my knapsack.\r\nI will open it here and now, and the first words my eye lights upon\r\nshall be a text for a few thoughts on this scene and scenery.  And\r\nhere they are,--seemingly not apposite to this line of reflection,\r\nyet running parallel to it very closely:\r\n\r\n[HEBREW PHRASE]\r\n\r\nThe best English that can be given of these words we have in our\r\ntranslation:  \"Blessed is he who, passing through the valley of\r\nBaca, maketh it a well.\"  Why so?  On what ground?  If a man had\r\nsettled down in that valley for life, there would have been no merit\r\nin his making it a well.  It might, in that case, have been an act\r\nof lean-hearted selfishness on his part.  Further than this, a man\r\nmight have done it who could have had the heart to wall it in from\r\nthe reach of thirsty travellers.  No such man was meant in the\r\nblessing; nor any man resident in or near the valley.  It was he who\r\nwas \"passing through\" it, and who stopped, not to search for a\r\ndribbling vein of water to satisfy his own momentary thirst, but to\r\nmake a well, broad and deep, after the oriental circumference, at\r\nwhich all future travellers that way might drink with gladness.\r\nThat was the man on whom the blessing rested as a _condition_, not\r\nas a _wish_.  Look at the word, and get the right meaning of it.  It\r\nis [HEBREW WORD], not [HEBREW WORD]; it is a blessedness, not a\r\nbenediction.  It means a permanent reality of happiness, like that\r\nof Obededom, not a cheap \"I thank you!\" or \"the Lord bless you!\"\r\nfrom here and there a man or woman who appreciates the benefaction.\r\n\r\nAnd he deserves the same who, \"passing through\" the short years of\r\nman's life here on earth, plants trees like the living, lofty\r\ncolumns of this long cathedral aisle.  How unselfish and generous is\r\nthis gift to coming generations!  How inestimable in its value and\r\nsurpassing the worth of wealth!--surpassing the measurement of gold\r\nand silver!  From my seat here, I look up to the magnificent\r\nfrontage of that baronial palace.  I see its towers, turrets and\r\nminarets; its grand and sculptured gateways and portals through this\r\nlong, leaf-arched aisle.  Not forty, but nearer four hundred years,\r\ndoubtless, was that pile in building.  Architecture of the pre-\r\nNorman period, and of all subsequent or cognate orders, diversifies\r\nthe tastes and shapings of the structure.  Suppose the whole should\r\ntake fire to-night and burn to the ground.  The wealth of the owner\r\ncould command genius, skill and labor enough to rebuild it in three\r\nyears, perhaps in one.  The Czar of all the Russias did as large a\r\nthing once as this last, in the reconstruction of a palace.  Perhaps\r\nthe building is insured for its positive value, and the insurance\r\nmoney would erect a better one.  But lift an axe upon that tall\r\ncenturion of these templed elms.  Cut through the closely-grained\r\nrings that register each succeeding year of two centuries.  Hear the\r\npeculiar sounding of the heart-strokes, when the lofty, well-poised\r\nstructure is balancing itself, and quivering through every fibre and\r\nleaf and twig on the few unsevered tendons that have not yet felt\r\nthe keen edge of the woodman's steel.  See the first leaning it\r\ncannot recover.  Hear the first cracking of the central vertebra;\r\nthen the mournful, moaning whir in the air; then the tremendous\r\ncrash upon the green earth; the vibration of the mighty trunk on the\r\nground, like the writhing and tremor of an ox struck by the\r\nbutcher's axe; the rebound into the air of dismembered branches; the\r\nfrightened flight of leaves and dust, and all the other distractions\r\nof that hour of death and destruction.  Look upon that ruin!  The\r\nwealth, genius and labor that could build a hundred Windsor Castles,\r\nand rebuild all the cathedrals of England in a decade, could not\r\nrebuild in two centuries that elm to the life and stature you\r\nlevelled to the dust in two hours.\r\n\r\nPut, then, the man who plants trees for posterity with him who,\r\n\"passing through the valley of Baca, maketh it a well.\"  Put him\r\nunder the same blessing of his kind, for he deserves it.  He gives\r\nthem the richest earthly gift that a man can give to a coming\r\ngeneration.  In a practical sense, he gives them _time_.  He gives\r\nthem a whole century, as an extra.  If they would pay a gold\r\nsovereign for every solid inch of oak, they could not hire one built\r\nto the stature of one of these trees in less than two centuries'\r\ntime, though they dug about it and nursed it as the man did the vine\r\nin Scripture.  Blessed be the builders of these living temples of\r\nNature!  Blessed be the man, rich or poor, old or young, especially\r\nthe old, who sets his heart and hand to this cheap but sublime and\r\npriceless architecture.\r\n\r\nLet connoisseurs who have seen Memphis, Nineveh, Athens, Rome, or\r\nany or all of the great cities of the East, ancient or modern, come\r\nand sit here, and look at this lofty corridor, and mark the orders\r\nand graces of its architecture.  What did the Ptolemies, their\r\npredecessors or successors in Egypt, or sovereigns of Chaldaic\r\nnames, in Assyria, or ambitious builders in the ages of Pericles or\r\nAugustus, in Greece or Rome?  Their structures were the wonders of\r\nthe world.  Mighty men they were, whose will was law, whose subjects\r\nworked it out to its wildest impulse without a murmur or a reward.\r\nBut who built this sixty-columned temple, and bent these lofty\r\narches?  Two or three centuries ago, two men in coarse garb, and, it\r\nmay be, in wooden shoes, came here with a donkey, bearing on its\r\nback a bundle of little elms, each of a finger's girth.  They came\r\nwith the rude pick and spade of that time; and, in the first six\r\nworking hours of the day, they dug thirty holes on this side of the\r\naisle, and planted in them half the tiny trees of their bundle.\r\nThey then sat down at noon to their bread and cheese and, most\r\nlikely, a mug of ale, and talked of small, home matters, just as if\r\nthey were dibbling in a small patch of wheat or potatoes.  They then\r\nwent to work again and planted the other row; and, as the sun was\r\ngoing down, they straightened their backs, and, with hands stayed\r\nupon their hips, looked up and down the two lines and thought they\r\nwould pass muster and please the master.  Then they shouldered their\r\nbrightened tools and went home to their low, dark cottages,\r\ndiscussing the prices of bread, beer and bacon, and whether the\r\nlikes of them could manage to keep a pig and make a little meat in\r\nthe year for themselves.\r\n\r\nThat is the story of this most magnificent structure to which you\r\nlook up with such admiration.  Those two men in smock frocks, each\r\nwith a pocket full of bread and cheese, were the Michael Angelos of\r\nthis lofty St. Peter's.  That donkey, with its worn panniers, was\r\nthe only witness and helper of their work.  And it was the work of a\r\nday!  They may have been paid two English shillings for it.  The\r\nlittle trees may have cost two shillings more, if taken from another\r\nestate.  The donkey's day was worth sixpence.  O, wooden-shoed\r\nPtolemies! what a day's work was that for the world!  They thought\r\nnothing of it--nothing more than they would of transplanting sixty\r\ncabbages.  They most likely did the same thing the next day, and for\r\nmost of the days of that year, and of the next year, until all these\r\nundulating acres were planted with trees of every kind that could\r\ngrow in these latitudes.  How cheap, but priceless, is the gift of\r\nsuch trees to mankind!  What a wealth, what a glory of them can even\r\na poor, laboring man give to a coming generation!  They are the most\r\ngenerous crops ever sown by human hands.  All others the sower reaps\r\nand garners into his own personal enjoyment; but this yields its\r\nbest harvest to those who come after him.  This is a seeding for\r\nposterity.  From this well of Baca shall they draw the cooling\r\nluxury of the gift when the hands that made it shall have gone to\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a good place and time to think of home--of what we begin\r\nto hear called by her younger children, _Old_ New England.  Trees\r\nwith us have passed through the two periods specified by Solomon--\"a\r\ntime to plant and a time to pluck up.\"  The last came first and\r\nlasted for a century.  Trees were the natural enemies to the first\r\nsettlers, and ranked in their estimation with the wild Indians,\r\nwolves and bears.  It was their first, great business to cut them\r\ndown, both great and small.  Forests fell before the woodman's axe.\r\nIt made clean work, and seldom spared an oak or an elm.  But, at the\r\nend of a century, the people relented and felt their mistake.  Then\r\ncommenced \"the time to plant;\" first in and around cities like\r\nBoston, Hartford, and New Haven, then about villages and private\r\nhomesteads.  Tree-planting for use and ornament marks and measures\r\nthe footsteps of our civilization.  The present generation is\r\nreaping a full reward of this gift to the next.  Every village now\r\nis coming to be embowered in this green legacy to the future; like a\r\nyoung mother decorating a Christmas-tree for her children.  Towns\r\ntwo hundred years old are taking the names of this diversified\r\narchitecture, and they glory in the title.  New Haven, with a\r\ncollege second to none on the American Continent, loves to be called\r\n\"The Elm City,\" before any other name.  This generous and elevating\r\ntaste is making its way from ocean to ocean, even marking the sites\r\nof towns and villages before they are built.  I believe there is an\r\nact of the Connecticut Legislature now in force, which allows every\r\nfarmer a certain sum of money for every tree he plants along the\r\npublic roadside of his fields.  The object of this is to line all\r\nthe highways of the State with ornamental trees, so that each shall\r\nbe a well-shaded avenue.  What a gift to another generation that\r\nsimple act is intended to make!  What a world of wonder and delight\r\nwill our little State be to European travellers and tourists of the\r\nnext century, if this measure shall be carried out!  If a few miles\r\nof such avenues as Burghley Park and Chatsworth present, command\r\nsuch admiration, what sentiments would a continuous avenue of trees\r\nof equal size from Hartford to New Haven inspire!\r\n\r\nWhile on this line of reflection, I will mention a case of\r\nmonumental tree-planting in New England, not very widely known\r\nthere.  A small town, in the heart of Massachusetts, was stirred to\r\nthe liveliest emotion, with all the rest in her borders, by the\r\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776.  Different communities\r\nexpressed their sense of the importance of this event in different\r\nways, most of which were noisy and excited.  But the good people of\r\nthis rural parish came together, and, at a happy suggestion from\r\nsome one of their number, agreed to spend the day in planting trees\r\nto commemorate the momentous transaction.  They forthwith set to\r\nwork, young and old, and planted first a double row on each side of\r\nthe walk from the main road up \"The Green\" to their church door;\r\nthen a row on each side of the public highway passing through the\r\nvillage, for nearly a mile in each direction.  There was a blessed\r\nday's work for them, their children and children's children.  Every\r\nhand that wielded a spade, or held up a treelet until its roots were\r\ncovered with earth, has long since lost its cunning; but the tall,\r\ngreen monuments they erected to the memory of the most momentous day\r\nin American history, stand in unbroken ranks, the glory of the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nAlthough America will never equal England, probably, in compact and\r\npicturesque \"plantations,\" or \"woods,\" covering hundreds of acres,\r\nall planted by hand, our shade-trees will outnumber hers, and\r\nsurpass them in picturesque distribution and arrangement, when our\r\npopular programme is fully carried out.  In two or three important\r\nparticulars, we have a considerable advantage over this country in\r\nrespect to this tasteful embellishment.  In the first place, all the\r\nfarmers in America own the lands they cultivate, and, on an average,\r\ntwo sides of every farm front upon a public road.  Two or three\r\ndays' work suffices for planting a row of trees the whole length of\r\nthis frontage, or the roadside of the farmer's fence or wall.  This\r\nis being done more and more extensively from year to year, generally\r\nunder the influence of public taste and custom, and sometimes under\r\nthe stimulus of governmental compensation, as in Connecticut.  Thus,\r\nin the life of the present generation, all our main roads and cross-\r\nroads may become arched and shaded avenues, giving the whole\r\nlandscape of the country an aspect which no other land will present.\r\n\r\nThen we have another great advantage which England can never attain\r\nuntil she learns how to consume her coal smoke.  Our wood and\r\nanthracite fires make no smoke to retard the growth or blacken the\r\nfoliage of our trees.  Thus we may have them in standing armies,\r\ntall and green, lining the streets, and overtopping the houses of\r\nour largest cities; filtering with their wholesome leafage the air\r\nbreathed by the people.  New Haven and Cleveland are good specimens\r\nof beautifully-shaded towns.\r\n\r\nThere is a third circumstance in our favor as yet, and of no little\r\nvalue.  The grand old English oak and elm are magnificent trees, in\r\npark or hedge-row here.  The horse-chestnut, lime, beech and ash\r\ngrow to a size that you will not see in America.  The Spanish\r\nchestnut, a larger and coarser tree than our American, reaches an\r\nenormous girth and spread.  The pines, larches and firs abound.\r\nThen there are tree-hunters exploring all the continents, and\r\nbringing new species from Japan and other antipodean countries.  But\r\nas yet, our maples have never been introduced; and without these the\r\ntree-world of any country must ever lack a beautiful feature, both\r\nin spring, summer and autumn, especially in the latter.  Our\r\nautumnal scenery without the maple, would be like the play of Hamlet\r\nwith Hamlet left out; or like a royal court without a queen.  Few\r\nAmericans, even loudest in its praise, realise how much of the glory\r\nof our Indian summer landscape is shed upon it by this single tree.\r\nAt all the Flower Shows I have seen in England and France, I have\r\nnever beheld a bouquet so glorious and beautiful as a little islet\r\nin a small pellucid lake in Maine, filled to the brim, and rounded\r\nup like a full-blown rose, with firs, larches, white birches and\r\nsoft maples, with a little sprinkling of the sumach.  An early frost\r\nhad touched the group with every tint of the rainbow, and there it\r\nstood in the ruddy glow of the Indian summer, looking at its face in\r\nthe liquid mirror that smiled, still as glass, under its feet.\r\n\r\nI was much pleased to notice what honor was put upon one of our\r\nhumble and despised trees in Burghley House park, as in the grounds\r\nof other noblemen.  There was not one that spread such delicate and\r\ngraceful tresses on the breeze as our White Birch; not one that\r\nfanned it with such a gentle, musical flutter of silver-lined\r\nleaves; not one that wore a bodice of such virgin white from head to\r\nfoot, or that showed such long, tapering fingers against the sky.  I\r\nwas glad to see such justice done to a tree in the noblest parks in\r\nEngland, which with us has been treated with such disdain and\r\ncontumely.  When I saw it here in such glory and honor, and thought\r\nhow, notwithstanding its Caucasian complexion, it is regarded as a\r\nnuisance in our woods, meadows and pastures, so that any man who\r\nowns, or can borrow an axe, may cut it down without leave or license\r\nwherever he finds it--when I saw this disparity in its status in the\r\ntwo Englands, I resolved to plead its cause in my own with new zeal\r\nand fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK TO OAKHAM--THE ENGLISH AND AMERICAN SPRING--THE ENGLISH GENTRY-\r\n-A SPECIMEN OF THE CLASS--MELTON MOWBRAY AND ITS SPECIALITIES--\r\nBELVOIR VALE AND ITS BEAUTY--THOUGHTS ON THE BLIND PAINTER.\r\n\r\nFrom Stamford to Oakham was an afternoon walk which I greatly\r\nenjoyed.  This was the first week of harvest, and the first of\r\nAugust.  How wonderfully the seasons are localised and subdivided.\r\nHow diversified is the economy of light and heat!  That field of\r\nwheat, thick, tall and ripe for the sickle, was green and apparently\r\ngrowing through all the months of last winter.  What a phenomenon it\r\nwould have been, on the first of February last, to a New England\r\nfarmer, suddenly transported from his snow-buried hills to the view\r\nof this landscape the same day!  Not a spire of grass or grain was\r\nalive when he left his own homestead.  All was cold and dead.  The\r\nvery earth was frozen to the solidity and sound of granite.  It was\r\na relief to his eye to see the snow fall upon the scene and hide it\r\ntwo feet deep for months.  He looks upon this, then upon the one he\r\nleft behind.  This looks full of luxuriant life, as green as his in\r\nMay.  It has three months' start of his dead and buried crop.  He\r\nwalks across it; his shoes sink almost to the instep in the soft\r\nsoil.  He sees birds hopping about in it without overcoats.  Surely,\r\nhe says to himself, this is a favored land.  Here it lies on the\r\nlatitudes of Labrador, and yet its midwinter fields are as green as\r\nours in the last month of Spring.  At this rate the farmers here\r\nmust harvest their wheat before the ears of mine are formed.  But he\r\ncounts without Nature.  The American sun overtakes and distances the\r\nEnglish by a full month.  Here is the compensation for six\r\nconsecutive months in which the New England farmer must house his\r\nplough and not turn a furrow.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, as much light and heat brighten and warm one country as\r\nthe other in the aggregate of a year.  But there is a great\r\ndifference in the economy of distribution.  In England, the sun\r\nspreads its warmth more evenly over the four seasons of the year.\r\nWhat it withholds from Summer it gives to Winter, and makes it wear\r\nthe face of Spring through its shortest and coldest days.  But then\r\nSpring loses a little from this equalising dispensation.  It is not\r\nthe resurrection from death and the grave as it is in America.\r\nChildren are not waiting here at the sepulchre of the season, as\r\nwith us, watching and listening for its little Bluebird angel to\r\nwarble from the first budding tree top, \"_It is risen_!\"  They do\r\nnot come running home with happy eyes, dancing for joy, and shouting\r\nthrough the half open door, \"O, mother, Spring has come!  We've\r\nheard the Bluebird!  Hurrah!  Spring has come.  We saw the Phebee on\r\nthe top of the saw-mill!\"  Here Spring makes no sensation; takes no\r\nsudden leap into the seat of Winter, but comes in gently, like the\r\nlaw of primogeniture or the British Constitution.  It is slow and\r\ndecorous in its movements.  It is conservative, treats its\r\npredecessor with much deference, and makes no sudden and radical\r\nchanges in the face of things.  It comes in with no Lord Mayor's\r\nDay, and blows no trumpets, and bends no triumphal arches to grace\r\nits entree.  Few new voices in the tree-tops hail its advent.  No\r\nchoirs of tree-toads fiddle in the fens.  No congregation of frogs\r\nat twilight gather to the green edges of the unfettered pond to sing\r\ntheir Old Hundred, led by venerable Signor Cronker, in his bright,\r\nbuskin doublet, mounted on a floating stump, and beating time with a\r\nbulrush.  No Shad-spirits with invisible wings, perform their\r\nundulating vespers in the heavens, to let the fishermen know that it\r\nis time to look to their nets.  Even the hens of the farm-yard\r\ncackle with no new tone of hope and animation at the birth of the\r\nEnglish Spring.  The fact is, it is a baby three months old when it\r\nis baptised.  It is really born at Christmas instead of Easter, and\r\nmakes no more stir in the family circle of the seasons than any\r\nfamiliar face would at a farmer's table.\r\n\r\nIn a utilitarian point of view, it is certainly an immense advantage\r\nto all classes in this country, that Nature has tempered her\r\nclimates to it in this kindly way.  I will not run off upon that\r\nline of reflection here, but will make it the subject of a few\r\nthoughts somewhere this side of John O'Groat's.  But what England\r\ngains over us in the practical, she loses in the poetical, in this\r\neconomy of the seasons.  Her Spring does not thrill like a sudden\r\nrevelation, as with us.  It does not come out like the new moon,\r\nhanging its delicate silver crescent in the western pathway of the\r\nsetting sun, which everybody tries to see first over the right\r\nshoulder, for the very luck of the coincidence.  Still, both\r\ncountries should be contented and happy under this dispensation of\r\nNature.  The balance is very satisfactory, and well suited to the\r\ncharacter and habits of the two peoples.  The Americans are more\r\nradical and sensational than the English; more given to sudden\r\nchanges and stirring events.  Sterne generally gets the credit of\r\nsaying that pretty thought first, \"Providence tempers the wind to\r\nthe shorn lamb.\"  A French writer puts it the other way, and more\r\npractically:  \"Providence tempers the wool of the lamb to the wind.\"\r\nThis is far better and more natural.  But it may be truly said that\r\nProvidence tempers the seasons to the temperaments and customs of\r\nthe two nations.\r\n\r\nJust before reaching Oakham, I passed a grand mansion, standing far\r\nback from the turnpike road, on a commanding eminence, flanked with\r\nextensive plantations.  The wide avenue leading to it looked a full\r\nmile in length.  Lawns and lakes, which mirrored the trees with\r\nequal distinctness, suffused the landscape of the park like evening\r\nsmiles of Nature.  It was indeed a goodly heritage for one man; and\r\nhe only mounted a plain _Mr_. to his name, although I learned that\r\nhe could count his farms by the dozen.  I was told that the annual\r\ndinner given to his tenant farmers came off the previous day at the\r\ninn where I lodged.  A sumptuous banquet was provided for them,\r\npresided over by the steward of the estate; as the great _Mr_. did\r\nnot honor the plebeian company with his presence.  This is a feature\r\nof the structure of English society which the best read American\r\nwould not be likely to recognise without travelling somewhat\r\nextensively in the country.  The British Nobility, the great, world-\r\nrenowned Middle Class, and the poor laboring population, constitute\r\nthe three great divisions of the people and include them all in his\r\nmind.  He is apt to leave out of count the Gentry, the great\r\nuntitled MISTERS, who come in between the nobility and middle-men,\r\nand constitute the connecting link between them.  \"The fine old\r\nEnglish gentleman, all of the olden time,\" is supposed to belong to\r\nthis class.  They make up most of \"the old county families,\" of\r\nwhich you hear more than you read.  They are generally large\r\nlandholders, owning from twenty to one hundred farms.  They live in\r\ngrand old mansions, surrounded with liveried servants, and inspire a\r\nmild awe and respectful admiration, not only in the common country\r\npeople, but in the minds of persons in whom an American would not\r\nlook for such homage to untitled rank.  They hunt with horses and\r\ndogs over the grounds of their tenant farmers, and the latter often\r\nact as game-beaters for them at their \"shootings.\"  When one of them\r\nowns a whole village, church and all, he is generally called \"the\r\nSquire,\" but most of them are squired without the definite article.\r\nThey still boast of as good specimens of \"the fine old English\r\ngentleman\" as the country can show; and I am inclined to think it is\r\nnot an unfounded pretension, although I have not yet come in contact\r\nwith many of the class.\r\n\r\nOne of this county squirocracy I know personally and well,--and\r\nother Americans know him as well as myself,--who, though living in a\r\npalace of his own, once occupied by an exiled French sovereign, is\r\njust as simple and honest as a child in every feature of his\r\ndisposition and deportment.  Every year he has a Festival in his\r\npark, lasting two or three days.  It is a kind of out-door\r\nParliament and a Greenwich Fair combined, as it would seem at first\r\nsight to an incidental spectator.  I do not believe anything in the\r\nrest of the wide world could equal this gathering, for many peculiar\r\nfeatures of enjoyment.  It is made up of both sexes and all ages and\r\nconditions; especially of the laboring classes.  They come out\r\nstrong on these occasions.  The round and red faced boys and girls\r\nof villages and hamlets for a great distance around look forward to\r\nthis annual frolic with exhilarating expectation.  Never was romping\r\nand racing and the amorous forfeit plays of the ring got up under\r\nmore favorable auspices, or with more pleasant surroundings.  It\r\nwould do any man's heart good, who was ever a genuine boy, to see\r\nthe venerable squire and his lady presiding over a race between\r\ncompeting couples of ploughmens' boys, from ten to fifteen years of\r\nage, running their rounds in the park, bare-footed, bare-headed,\r\nwith faces as round and red as a ripe pumpkin, and hair of the same\r\ncolor whipping the air as they neck-and-neck it in the middle of the\r\nheat.  When the winners of the prizes receive their rewards at his\r\nhands, his kind words and the radiant benevolence of his face they\r\nvalue more than the conquest and the coins they win.\r\n\r\nThen there are intellectual entertainments and deliberative\r\nproceedings of grave moment arranged for the elder portion of the\r\ngreat congregation.  While groups of blushing lads and lasses are\r\nhunting the handkerchief in the hustle and tussle of the ring under\r\nthe great, solemn elms, a scene may be witnessed on the lawn nearer\r\nthe mansion that ought to have been painted long ago.  Two or three\r\ndouble-horse wagons are ranged end to end in the shade, and planks\r\nare placed along from one end to the other, making a continuous seat\r\nfor a score or two of orators.  In front of this dozen-wheeled\r\ntribune rows of seats, capable of holding several hundred persons,\r\nare arranged within hearing distance.  When these are filled and\r\nsurrounded by a standing wall of men and women, three or four deep,\r\nand when the orators of the day ascend over the wheels to the long\r\nwagon-seat, you have a scene and an assembly the like of which you\r\nfind nowhere else in Christendom.  No Saxon parliament of the\r\nHeptarchy could \"hold a candle to it.\"  Never, in any age or country\r\nof free speech, did individual ideas, idiosyncrasies, and liberty of\r\nconscience have freer scope and play.  Never did all the isms of\r\nphilanthropy, politics, or of social and moral reform generally have\r\nsuch a harmonious trysting time of it.  Never was there a platform\r\nerected for discussing things local and general so catholic as the\r\none now resting upon the wheels of those farm wagons.  Every year\r\nthe bland and venerable host succeeds in widening the area of\r\ndebate.  I was invited to be present at the Festival this year, but\r\nwas too far on the road to John O'Groat's to participate in a\r\npleasure I have often enjoyed.  But I read his resume of the year's\r\ndoings, aspects and prospects from Japan to Hudson's Bay with lively\r\ninterest and valuable instruction.  He seldom presides himself as\r\nchairman, but leaves that post of honor to be filled, if possible,\r\nby the citizen of some foreign country, if he can speak English\r\ntolerably.  This gives a more cosmopolitan aspect to the assembly.\r\nBut he himself always makes what in Parliament would be called \"a\r\nfinancial statement,\" without the reference to money matters.  He\r\nsums up the significance of all the great events of the year,\r\nbearing upon human progress in general, and upon each specific\r\nenterprise in particular.  With palatial mansions, parks, and farms\r\ngreat and small, scattered through several counties, he is the\r\ngreatest radical in England.  He distances the Chartists altogether\r\nin his programme, and adds several new points to their political\r\ncreed.  He not only advocates manhood suffrage, but womanhood\r\nsuffrage, and woman-seats in Parliament.  Then he is a great friend\r\nof a reform which the Chartists grievously overlook, and which would\r\nmake thousands of them voters if they would adopt it.  That is,\r\nTotal Abstinence from Tobacco, as well as from Ardent Spirits.\r\nThus, no report of modern times equals the good Squire's summing-up,\r\nwhich he gives on these occasions, from the great farm-wagon\r\ntribune, to the multitudinous and motley congregation assembled\r\nunder his park trees.  This year it was unusually rich and piquant,\r\nfrom the expanded area of events and aspects.  In presenting these,\r\nas bearing upon the causes of Temperance, Peace, Anti-War, Anti-\r\nSlavery, Anti-Tobacco, Anti-Capital Punishment, Anti-Church-Rates,\r\nFree Trade, Woman's Rights, Parliamentary Reform, Social Reform,\r\nScientific Progress, Discovery of the Sources of the Nile, and other\r\nimportant movements, he was necessarily obliged to be somewhat\r\ndiscursive.  But he generalised with much ease and perspicuity, and\r\nconducted the thread of his discourse, like a rivulet of light,\r\nthrough the histories of the year; transporting the mind of his\r\naudience from doings in Japan to those in America, from Poland to\r\nMexico, and through stirring regions of Geography, Politics,\r\nPhilanthropy, Social Science and Economy, by gentle and interesting\r\ntransitions.  This annual statement is very valuable and\r\ninstructive, and should have a wider publicity than it usually\r\nobtains.\r\n\r\nWhen \"the fine old English gentleman all of the olden time\" has\r\nconcluded his resume of the year's progress, and the prospects it\r\nleaves to the one incoming, the orators of the different causes\r\nwhich he has thus reported, arise one after the other, and the\r\nbright air and the green foliage of the over-spreading trees, as\r\nwell as the listening multitude below are stirred with fervid\r\nspeeches, sometimes interspersed with \"music from the band.\"  The\r\nFestival is wound up by a banquet in the hall, given by the\r\nmunificent host to a large number of guests, representing the\r\nvarious good movements advocated from the platform described.  Many\r\nAmericans have spoken from that rostrum, and sat at that banquet\r\ntable in years gone by, and they will attest to the correctness of\r\nthese slight delineations of the character of the host and of the\r\nannual festival that will perpetuate his name in long and pleasant\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nOakham is a goodly and pleasant town, the chief and capital of\r\nRutlandshire.  It has the ruins of an old castle in its midst, and\r\nseveral interesting antiquities and customs.  It, too, has its\r\nunique speciality or prerogative.  I was told that every person of\r\ntitle driving through the town, or coming to reside within the\r\njurisdiction of its bye-laws, must leave his card to the authorities\r\nin the shape of a veritable horse-shoe.  It is said that the walls\r\nof the old town hall are hung with these iron souvenirs of\r\ndistinguished visits; thus constituting a museum that would be\r\ninstructive to a farrier or blacksmith, as well as to the\r\nantiquarian.\r\n\r\nFrom Oakham I walked to Melton Mowbray, a cleanly, good-looking town\r\nin Leicestershire, situated on the little river Eye.  One cannot say\r\nexactly in regard to Rutlandshire what an Englishman once said to\r\nthe authorities of a pigmy Italian duchy, who ordered him to leave\r\nit in twenty-four hours.  \"I only require fifteen minutes,\" said\r\ncousin John, with a look and tone which Jonathan could not imitate.\r\nThis rural county is to the shire-family of England what Rhode\r\nIsland is to the American family of States--the smallest, but not\r\nleast, in several happy characteristics.\r\n\r\nI spent a quiet Sabbath in Melton Mowbray; attended divine service\r\nin the old parish church and listened to two extemporaneous sermons\r\nfull of simple and earnest teaching, and delivered in a\r\nconversational tone of voice.  Here, too, the parish church was\r\nseated in the midst of the great congregation which had long ceased\r\nto listen to the call of its Sabbath bells.  It was a beautiful and\r\ntouching arrangement of the olden time to erect the House of Prayer\r\nin the centre of \"God's Acre,\" that the shadow of its belfry and the\r\nSabbath voice of its silvery bells might float for centuries over\r\nthe family circles lying side by side in their long homes around the\r\nsanctuary.  There was a good and tender thought in making up this\r\nsabbath society of the living and the dead; in planting the narrow\r\npathway between the two Sions with the white milestones of\r\ngenerations that had travelled it in ages gone, leaving here and\r\nthere words of faith, hope and admonition to those following in\r\ntheir footsteps.  It is one of the contingencies of \"higher\r\ncivilization\" that this social economy of the churchyard, that\r\nlinked present and past generations in such touching and instructive\r\ncompanionship, has been suspended and annulled.\r\n\r\nMelton Mowbray has also a very respectable individuality.  It is a\r\ngreat centre for the scarlet-coated Nimrods who scale hedges and\r\nditches, in well-mounted squadrons, after a fox _preserved_ at great\r\nexpense and care to become the victim of their valor.  But this is a\r\nsmall and frivolous distinction compared with its celebrated\r\nmanufacture of _pork-pies_.  It bids fair to become as famous for\r\nthem as Banbury is for buns.  I visited the principal establishment\r\nfor providing the travelling and picnicking world with these very\r\nsubstantial and palatable portables.  I went under the impulse of\r\nthat uneasy, suspicious curiosity to peer into the forbidden\r\nmysteries of the kitchen which generally brings no satisfaction when\r\ngratified, and which often admonishes a man not only to eat what is\r\nset before him without any questions for conscience sake, but also\r\nfor the sake of the more delicate and exacting sensibilities of the\r\nstomach.  I must confess my first visit to this, the greatest pork-\r\npie factory in the world, savored a little of the anxiety to know\r\nthe worst, instead of the best, in regard to the solid materials and\r\nlighter ingredients which entered into the composition of these\r\nsuspiciously cheap luxuries.  There were points also connected with\r\nthe process of their elaboration which had given me an undefinable\r\nuneasiness in the refreshment rooms of a hundred railway stations.\r\nI was determined to settle these moot points once for all.  So I\r\nentered the establishment with an eye of as keen a speculation as an\r\nexciseman's searching a building for illicit distillery, and I came\r\nout of it a more charitable and contented man.  All was above board,\r\nfair and clean.  The meat was fresh and good.  The flour was fine\r\nand sweet; the butter and lard would grace the neatest housewife's\r\nlarder; the forms on which the pies were moulded were as pure as\r\nspotless marble.  The men and boys looked healthy and bright; their\r\nhands were smooth and clean, and their aprons white as snow.  Not\r\none of them smoked or took snuff at his work.  I saw every process\r\nand implement employed in the construction of these pies for the\r\nmarket; the great tubs of pepper and spice, the huge ovens, the\r\ncooling racks, the packing room; in a word, every department and\r\nfeature of the establishment.  And the best thing that I can say of\r\nit is this:  that I shall eat with better satisfaction and relish\r\nhereafter the pies bearing the brand of Evans, of Melton Mowbray,\r\nthan I ever did before.  The famous Stilton cheese is another\r\nspeciality of this quiet and interesting town, or of its immediate\r\nneighborhood.  So, putting the two articles of luxury and\r\nconsumption together, it is rather ahead of Banbury with its cakes.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, August 11th, I resumed my walk northward, and passed\r\nthrough a very highly cultivated and interesting section.  About the\r\nmiddle of the afternoon, I reached Broughton Hill, and looked off\r\nupon the most beautiful and magnificent landscape I have yet seen in\r\nEngland.  It was the Belvoir Vale; and it would be worth a hundred\r\nmiles' walk to see it, if that was the only way to reach it.  It lay\r\nin a half-moon shape, the base line measuring apparently about\r\ntwenty miles in length.  As I sat upon the high wall of this valley,\r\nthat overlooks it on the south, I felt that I was looking upon the\r\nmost highly-finished piece of pre-Raphaelite artistry that could be\r\nfound in the world,--the artistry of the plough, glorious and\r\nbeautiful with the unconscious and involuntary pictures which\r\npatient human labor paints upon the canvas of Nature.  Never did I\r\nsee the like before.  If Turner had the shaping of the ground\r\nentirely for an artistic purpose, it could not have been more\r\nhappily formed for a display of agricultural pictures.  What might\r\nbe called the _physical_ vista made the most perfect hemiorama I\r\never looked upon.  The long, high, wooded ridge, including Broughton\r\nHill, _eclipsed_, as it were, just half the disk of a circle twenty\r\nmiles in diameter, leaving the other half in all the glow and glory\r\nthat Nature and that great blind painter, Agricultural Industry,\r\ncould give to it.  The valley with its foot against this mountainous\r\nridge, put out its right arm and enfolded to its bosom a little,\r\nbeautiful world of its own of about fifty miles girth.  In this\r\nembrace were included hundreds of softly-rounded hills, with their\r\nintervening valleys, villages, hamlets, church spires and towers,\r\nplantations, groves, copses and hedge-row trees, grouped by sheer\r\naccident as picturesquely as Turner himself could have arranged\r\nthem.  The elevation of the ridge on which I sat softened down all\r\nthese distant hills, so that they looked only like little undulating\r\nrisings by which the valley gently ascended to the blue rim of the\r\nhorizon on the north.\r\n\r\nIt was an excellent standpoint on which to balance Nature and Human\r\nIndustry; to estimate their separate and joint work upon that vast\r\nlandscape.  A few centuries ago, perhaps about the time that the\r\nMayflower sighted Plymouth Rock, this valley, now so indescribably\r\nbeautiful, was almost in the state of nature.  Wolves and wild boars\r\nmay have been prowling about in the woods and tangled thickets that\r\ncovered this ridge back for several leagues.  Bushes, bogs and\r\nbriers, and coarse prairie grass roughened the bottom of this\r\nvalley; matted heather, furze, broom and clumps of shrubby trees,\r\nall those hills and uplands arising in the background to the\r\nnorthward horizon.  This declining sun, and the moon and stars that\r\nwill soon follow in the pathway of its chariot, like a liveried\r\ncortege, shone upon that scene with all the light they will give\r\nthis day and night.  The rain and dew, and all the genial ministries\r\nof the seasons, did their unaided best to make it lovely and\r\nbeautiful.  The sweetest singing-birds of England came and tried to\r\ncheer its solitude with their happy voices.  The summer breezes came\r\nwith their softest breath, whispering through brake, bush and brier\r\nthe little speeches of Nature's life.  The summer bees came and\r\nfilled all those heather-purpled acres with their industrial lays,\r\nand sang a merry song in the door of every wild-flower that gave\r\nthem the petalled honey of its heart.  All the trained and\r\ntravelling industrials and all the sweet influences of Nature came\r\nand did all they could without man's help to make this great valley\r\nmost delightful to the eye.  But the wolves still prowled and\r\nhowled; the briers grew rough and rank; the grass, coarse and thin;\r\nthe heathered hills were oozy and cold in their watery beds; the\r\nclumpy, shrubby trees wore the same ragged coats of moss; and no\r\nfeature of the scene mended for the better from year to year.\r\n\r\nThen came the great Blind Painter, with his rude, iron pencils, to\r\nthe help of Nature.  He came with the Axe, Plough and Spade, her\r\nmightiest allies.  With these he had driven wild Druidic Paganism\r\nback mile by mile from England's centre; back into her dark\r\nfastnesses.  With the Axe, Spade and Plough he chased the foul\r\nbeasts and barbarisms from the island.  Two centuries long was he in\r\npainting this Beautiful Valley.  Nature ground and mixed the colors\r\nfor him all the while, for he was blind.  He was poor; often cold\r\nand hungry, and his children, with blue fingers and pale, silent\r\neyes, sometimes asked for bread in winter he could not give.  He\r\nlived in a low cottage, small, damp and dark, and laid him down at\r\nnight upon a bed of straw.  He could not read; and his thoughts of\r\nhuman life and its hereafter were few and small.  He had no taste\r\nfor music, and seldom whistled at his work.  He wore a coarse\r\ngarment, of ghostly pattern, called a smock-frock.  His hat just\r\nrounded his head to a more globular and mindless form.  His shoes\r\nwere as heavy as a horse's with iron nails.  He had no eye nor taste\r\nfor colors.  If all the trees, if all the crops of grain, grass and\r\nroots on which he wrought his life long, had come out in brickdust\r\nand oil, it would have been all the same to him, if they had sold as\r\nhigh in the market, and beer and bread had been as cheap for the\r\nuniformity.  And yet he was the Turner of this great painting.  He\r\nis the artist that has made England a gallery of the finest\r\nagricultural pictures in the world.  And in no country in\r\nChristendom is High Art so appreciated to such pecuniary patronage\r\nand valuation as here.  In none is the genius of the Pencil so\r\ntreasured, so paid, and almost worshipped as here.  The public and\r\nprivate galleries of Britain hold pictures that would buy every acre\r\nof the island at the price current of it when Elizabeth was queen.\r\nOne of Turner's landscapes would pay for a whole Highland county at\r\nits valuation when Mary held her first court at Holyrood.\r\n\r\nI sit here and look off upon this largest, loveliest picture the\r\nBlind Painter has given to England.  I note his grouping of the ivy-\r\nframed fields, of every size and form, panelling the gently-rounded\r\nhills, and all the soft slopes down to the foot of the valley; the\r\nsilvery, ripe barley against the dark-green beans; the rich gold of\r\nthe wheat against the smooth, blue-dashed leaves of the mangel\r\nwurzel or rutabaga; the ripening oats overlooking a foreground of\r\nvividly green turnips, with alternations of pasture and meadow land,\r\nhedges running in every direction, plantations, groves, copses\r\nsprinkled over the whole vista, as if the whole little world, clear\r\nup to the soft, blue fringe of the horizon, were the design and work\r\nof a single artist.  And this, and ten thousand pictures of the same\r\ngenius, were the work of the Briarean-handed BLIND PAINTER, who\r\nstill wears a smock-frock and hob-nailed shoes, and lives in a low,\r\ndamp cottage, and dines on bread and cheese among the golden sheaves\r\nof harvest!\r\n\r\nO, Mother England! thou that knightest the artists while living, and\r\nbuildest their sepulchres when dead; thou that honorest to such\r\nstature of praise the plagiarists upon Nature, and clothest the\r\ncopyists of patient Labor's pictures in such purple and fine linen;\r\nthou whose heart is softening to the sweet benevolences of Christian\r\ncharity in so many directions,--wilt thou not think, with a new\r\nsentiment of kindness and sympathy, on this Blind Painter, who has\r\ntapestried the hills and valleys of thy island with an artistry that\r\nangels might look upon with admiration and wonder!\r\n\r\nWilt thou not build him a better cottage to live in?\r\n\r\nWilt thou not give him something better than dry bread and cold\r\nbacon for dinner in harvest?\r\n\r\nWilt thou not teach all his children to read the alphabet and the\r\nblessed syllables of the Great Revelation of God's Love to man?\r\n\r\nWilt thou not make a morning-ward door in his dwelling and show him\r\na future with a sun in it, in _this_ world, as well as the world to\r\ncome?\r\n\r\nWilt thou not open up a pathway through the valley of his\r\nhumiliation by which his children may ascend to the better\r\nconditions of society?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTTINGHAM AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS--NEWSTEAD ABBEY--MANSFIELD--TALK\r\nIN A BLACKSMITH'S SHOP--CHESTERFIELD, CHATSWORTH AND HADDON HALL--\r\nARISTOCRATIC CIVILISATION, PRESENT AND PAST.\r\n\r\nFrom the Belvoir Vale I continued my walk to Nottingham the\r\nfollowing day; crossing a grand old bridge over the Trent.  Take it\r\nall in all, this may be called perhaps the most English town in\r\nEngland; stirring, plucky and radical; full of industrial intellect\r\nand vigor.  Its chief businesses involve and exercise thought; and\r\nthought educed into one direction and activity, runs naturally into\r\nothers.  The whole population, under these influences, has become\r\n_peopled_ to a remarkable status and strength of opinion, sentiment\r\nand action.  They prefix that large and generous quality to their\r\nbest doings and institutions, and have their Peoples' College,\r\nPeoples' Park, etc.  The Peoples' Charter had its stronghold here,\r\nand all radical reforms are sure to find sympathy and support among\r\nthe People of Nottingham.  I should think no equal population in the\r\nkingdom would sing \"Britons never, never will be slaves,\" with more\r\nspirit, or, perhaps, with more understanding.  Their plucky, English\r\nnatures became terribly stirred up in the exciting time of the\r\nReform Bill, and they burned down the magnificent palace-castle of\r\nthe old Duke of Newcastle, crowning the mountainous rock which\r\nterminates on the west the elevated ridge on which the town is\r\nbuilt.  When the Bill was carried, and the People had cooled down to\r\ntheir normal condition of mind, they were obliged to pay for this\r\nevening's illumination of their wrath pretty dearly.  The Duke\r\nmulcted the town and county to the tune of 21,000 pounds, or full\r\n$100,000.  The castle was no Chepstow structure, rough and rude for\r\nwar, but more like the ornate and castellated palace at Heidelberg,\r\nand it was almost as high above the Trent as the latter is above the\r\nNeckar.  The view the site commands is truly magnificent, embracing\r\nthe Trent Valley, and an extensive vista beyond it.  It was really\r\nthe great lion of the town, and the People, having paid the 21,000\r\npounds for dismounting it, because it roared in the wrong direction\r\non the Reform Bill, expected, of course, that His Grace the Duke\r\nwould set it up again on the old pedestal, with its mane and tail\r\nand general aspect much improved.  But they counted without their\r\nhost.  \"Is it not lawful to do what I will with my own,\" was the\r\nsubstance of his reply; and there stands the blackened, crumbling\r\nruin to this day, as a silent but grim reproach to the People for\r\nletting their angry passions rise to such destructive excitement on\r\npolitical questions.\r\n\r\nHosiery and lace are the two great manufacturing interests of\r\nNottingham, and the tons of these articles it turns out yearly for\r\nthe world are astonishing in number and value.  A single London\r\nhouse employs 3,000 hands in the town and immediate vicinity upon\r\nhosiery alone for its establishment.  Lace now seems to lead the\r\nway, and there are whole streets of factories and warehouses busy\r\nwith its manufacture and sale.  Perhaps no fabric in the world ever\r\ntested the ingenuity and value of machinery like this.  The cost has\r\nbeen reduced, from the old hand-working to the present process, from\r\nthree dollars to three cents a yard!  I think no machinery yet\r\ninvented has been endowed with more delicate functions of human\r\nreason and genius than that employed upon the flower-work of this\r\nsubtle drapery.  Until I saw it with my own eyes, I had concluded\r\nthat the machinery invented or employed in America for setting card-\r\nteeth was the most astute, and as nearly approaching the faculties\r\nof the human mind in its apparent thought-power, as it was reverent\r\nand safe to carry anything made of iron and steel, or made by man at\r\nall.  To construct a machine which should pass between its fingers a\r\nbroad belt of leather and a fine thread of wire, prick rows of holes\r\nacross the breadth of the leather, bend, cut off, and insert the\r\nshank ends of the teeth clear through these holes, and clinch them\r\non the back side, and pour out a continuous, uninterrupted stream of\r\nperfectly-teethed belt, all ready for carding,--this, I fancied, was\r\nthe ne plus ultra of mechanical inventions.  But it is quite\r\nsurpassed by the lace-weaving looms of Nottingham, that work out, to\r\nexquisite perfection, all the flowers, leaves, vines and vein-work\r\nof nature.  It was wonderful to see the ductility of cotton, as here\r\nexemplified.  The _bobbins_, which, I suppose, are a mere refinement\r\nupon the old hand-thrown shuttle, are of brass, about the size of\r\nhalf-a-crown.  A groove that will just admit the thin edge of a\r\ncase-knife, is cut into the rim of the little wheel, about one\r\nquarter of an inch deep.  A cotton thread, 120 yards in length, and\r\nstrong enough to be twitched about and twisted by a score of\r\nvigorous, chattering, iron fingers, is wound around in this groove.\r\nBut it would be idle to attempt a description of either the\r\nmachinery or the process.\r\n\r\nI went next into a large establishment for dyeing, dressing, winding\r\nand packing the lace for market.  It was startling to see the acres\r\nof it dyed black for mourning.  Really there seemed enough of it to\r\ndrape the whole valley of the shadow of death!  It was an impressive\r\nsight truly.  If there were other establishments doing the same\r\nthing, Nottingham must turn out weeds of grief enough for several\r\nmillions of mourning widows, mothers, sisters and daughters in a\r\nyear.  I ascended into the dressing-room, I think they called it, in\r\nthe upper story, where there was a piece containing one twenty-fifth\r\nof an acre of lace undergoing a fearful operation for a human\r\nconstitution to sustain.  It was necessary that the heat of the\r\napartment should be kept at _one hundred and twenty_ degrees!  There\r\nwas a large number of women and girls, and a few men and boys\r\nworking under this melting ordeal.  And one of the proprietors was\r\nat their head, in a rather summer dress, and with a seethed and\r\ncrimson face beaded with hot perspiration.  It was a very delicate\r\nand important operation which he had not only to watch with his own\r\neyes, but to work at with his own hands.  I was glad to learn that\r\nhe was a staunch Protestant, and did not believe in _purgatory_; but\r\nthose poor girls!--could they be expected to hold to the same belief\r\nunder such a test?\r\n\r\nI was told that they could get up lace so cheap that the people of\r\nthe town frequently cover their gooseberry bushes with it to keep\r\noff the insects.  Spider-webbing is a scarcely more gossamer-like\r\nfabric.  Sixteen square yards of this lace only weigh about an\r\nounce!  If the negroes on one of the South Carolina Sea-island\r\nplantations could have been shut into that dressing-room for two\r\nwhole minutes, with the mercury at 120 degrees, they would have\r\nrolled up the whites of their eyes in perfect amazement and made a\r\nrush for \"Dixie\" again.\r\n\r\nFrom Nottingham I made an afternoon walk to Mansfield.  The weather\r\nwas splendid and the country in all the glory of harvest.  On\r\nreaching Newstead Abbey, I found, to my regret, that the entree to\r\nthe public had been closed by the new proprietor, one, I was told,\r\nof the manufacturing gentry of the Manchester school.  Not that he\r\nwas less liberal and accommodating to sight-seers than his\r\npredecessors, but because he was making very extensive and costly\r\nimprovements in the buildings and grounds.  I have seen nothing yet\r\nin England to compare, for ornate carving, with the new gate-way he\r\nis making to the park.  It is of the finest kind of arabesque work\r\ndone in stone that much resembles the Caen.  This prevention barred\r\nme from even a distant view of the once famous residence of Lord\r\nByron, as it could not be seen from the public road.\r\n\r\nWithin about three miles of Mansfield, I came to a turnpike gate,--a\r\nneat, cozy, comfortable cottage, got up in the Gothic order.  I\r\nstopped to rest a moment, and noticing the good woman setting her\r\ntea-table, I invited myself to a seat at it, on the inn basis, and\r\nhad a pleasant meal and chat with her and an under-gamekeeper of the\r\nDuke of Portland, who had come in a little before me.  The stories\r\nhe told me about the extent of the Duke's possessions were\r\nmarvellous, more especially in reference to his game preserves.  I\r\nshould think there must be a larger number of hares, rabbits and\r\npartridges on his estate than in the whole of New England.  As I sat\r\nengaged in conversation with the woman of the house and this\r\naccidental guest, an unmistakable American face met my eyes, as I\r\nraised them to the opposite wall.  It was the familiar face of a\r\nBristol clock, made in the Connecticut village adjoining the one in\r\nwhich I was born.  It wore the same honest expression, which a great\r\nmany ill-natured people, especially in our Southern States, have\r\nregarded as covering a dishonest and untruthful mind, or a bad\r\nmemory of the hours.  Still it is the most ubiquitous Americanism in\r\nthe world, and it is pleasant to see its face in so many cottages of\r\nlaboring men from Land's End to John O'Groat's.\r\n\r\nMansfield is a very substantial and venerable town, bearing a name\r\nwhich one distinguished man has rendered illustrious by wearing it\r\nthrough a brilliant life.  It is situated near the celebrated\r\nSherwood Forest, and is marked by many features of peculiar\r\ninterest.  One of its noticeable celebrities is the house in which\r\nLord Chesterfield resided.  It is now occupied by a Wesleyan\r\nminister, who elaborates his sermons in the very room, I believe, in\r\nwhich that fashionable nobleman penned his polite literature for\r\nyouthful candidates for the uppermost circles of society.  In the\r\ncentre of the market place there is a magnificent monument erected\r\nto the memory of the late Lord George Bentinck, who was held in high\r\nesteem by the people of the town and vicinity.  The manufactures are\r\npretty much the same as in Nottingham.  They turn out a great\r\nproduction of raw material in red sandstone, very much resembling\r\nour Portland, quite as fine, hard and durable.  Immense blocks of it\r\nare quarried and conveyed to London and to all parts of the kingdom.\r\nThe town also supplies a vast amount of moulding sand, of nearly the\r\nsame color and consistency as that we procure from Albany.  I\r\nstopped on my way into the town to take a turn through the cemetery,\r\nwhich was very beautifully laid out, and looked like a great garden\r\nlawn belted with shrubbery, and illuminated with the variegated\r\nlamps of flowers of every hue and breath.  The meandering walks were\r\nall laid with asphalte, which presented a new and striking contrast\r\nto the gorgeous borders and the vivid green of the cleanly shaven\r\ngrass.  Many of the little graves were made in nests of geraniums\r\nand other modest and sweet-eyed stars of hope.\r\n\r\nNext day I had a very enjoyable walk in a north-westerly direction\r\nto Chesterfield.  On the way, called in at a blacksmith's shop, and\r\nhad a long talk with the smith-in-chief on matters connected with\r\nhis trade.  The \"custom-work\" of such shops in country villages in\r\nEngland is like that in ours fifty years ago--embracing the greatest\r\nvariety of jobs.  Articles now made with us in large manufacturing\r\nestablishments at a price which would starve a master and his\r\napprentice to compete with, are hammered out in these English shops\r\non a single anvil.  On comparing notes with this knight of the\r\nhammer, I learned a fact I had not known before.  His price for\r\nhorse-shoeing varied according to the size of the hoof, just as our\r\nleather-shoemakers charge according to the foot.  On taking leave of\r\nhim he intimated, in the most frank and natural way in the world,\r\nthat, in our exchange of information, the balance was in his favor,\r\nand that I could not but think it fair to pay him the difference.  I\r\nlooked at him first inquiringly and doubtingly, embarrassed with the\r\nidea that I had not understood him, or that he was a journeyman and\r\nnot the master of the establishment.  But he was as free and easy\r\nand natural as possible.  An American tobacco-chewer, of fifty\r\nyears' standing, would not have asked a cut from a neighbor's\r\n\"lady's twist,\" or \"pig-tail\" in more perfect good faith.  That\r\ngood, round, English face would have blushed crimson if the man\r\nsuspected that I misunderstood him.  Nay, more, he would quite\r\nlikely have thrown the pennies at my head if I had offered them to\r\nhim to buy bread or bacon with for himself and family.  I had no\r\nreason for a moment's doubt.  It all meant _beer_, \"only that and\r\nnothing more;\" a mere pour boire souvenir to celebrate our mutual\r\nacquaintance.  So I gave him a couple of pennies, just as I would\r\nhave given him a bite of tobacco if we had both been in that line.\r\nI feared to give him more, lest he might think I meant bread and\r\nbacon and thought him a beggar.  But I ventured to tell him,\r\nhowever, that I did not use that beverage myself, and hoped he would\r\nwish me health in some better enjoyment.\r\n\r\nI saw, for the first time, a number of Spanish cattle feeding in a\r\npasture.  They were large, variously colored animals with the\r\nwidely-branching horns that distinguish them.  A man must have a\r\nlong range of buildings to stable a score of creatures with such\r\nhorns, and for that reason they will only be kept as curiosities in\r\nthese northern latitudes.  And they are curiosities of animal life,\r\nheightened to a wonderment when placed side by side with the black\r\nGalloways, or those British breeds of cattle which have no horns at\r\nall.  I should not wonder, however, if this large, cream-colored\r\nstock from Spain should be introduced here to cross with the\r\nDurhams, Devons, and Herefords.\r\n\r\nWhen about half-way from Mansfield to Chesterfield, a remarkable\r\nchange came over the face of the landscape.  The mosaic work of the\r\nhill-sides and valleys showed more green squares than before.\r\nThree-fourths of the fields were meadow or pasture, or in mangel or\r\nturnips.  There was but one here and there in wheat or other grain.\r\nThe road beneath and the sky above began to blacken, and the\r\nchimneys of coal-pits to thicken.  Sooty-faced men, horses and\r\ndonkeys passed with loaded carts; and all the premonitory aspects of\r\nthe \"black country\" multiplied as I proceeded.  I do not recollect\r\never seeing a landscape change so suddenly in England.\r\n\r\nChesterfield is an intelligent looking town, evidently growing in\r\npopulation and prosperity.  It has its own unique speciality; almost\r\nas strikingly distinctive as that of Strasburg or Pisa.  This is the\r\nmost ambiguous and mysterious church spire in the world.  It would\r\nbe very difficult to convey any idea of it by any description from\r\nan unaided pen; and there is nothing extant that would avail as an\r\nillustration.  The church is very old and large, and stands upon a\r\ncommanding eminence.  The massive tower supports a tall but suddenly\r\ntapering spire of the most puzzling construction to the eye.  It\r\nmust have been designed by a monk of the olden time, with a Chinese\r\nturn of ingenuity.  There is no order known to architecture to\r\nfurnish a term or likeness for it.  A ridgy, spiral spire are the\r\nthree most descriptive words, but these are not half enough for\r\nstating the shape, style and posture of this strange steeple.  It is\r\ndifficult even to assist the imagination to form an idea of it.  I\r\nwill essay a few words in that direction.  Suppose, then, a plain\r\nspire, 100 feet high, in the form of an attenuated cone, planted\r\nupon a heavy church tower.  Now, in imagination, plough this cone\r\nall around into deep ridges from top to bottom.  Then mount to the\r\ntop, and, with a great iron wrench, give it an even twist clear down\r\nto the base, so that each ridge shall wind entirely around the spire\r\nbetween the bottom and the top.  Then, in giving it this screw-\r\nlooking twist, bend over the top, with a gentle incline all the way\r\ndown, so that it shall be \"out of perpendicular\" by about three\r\nfeet.  Then come down and look at your work, and you will be\r\nastonished at it, standing far or near.  The tall, ridgy, curved,\r\nconical screw puzzles you with all sorts of optical illusions.  As\r\nthe eyes in a front-face portrait follow you around the room in\r\nwhich it is hung, so this strange spire seems to lean over upon you\r\nat every point, as you walk round the church.  Indeed, I believe it\r\nwas only found out several centuries after its erection, that it\r\nabsolutely leaned more in one direction than another.  It is a\r\nremarkable sight from the railway as you approach the town from a\r\ndistance.  If it may be said reverently, the church, standing on\r\ncomparatively a hill, not only lifts its horn on high, but one like\r\nthat of a rhinoceros, considerably curved.  Just outside the town\r\nstands the house in which George Stephenson lived his last days, and\r\nended his great life of benefaction to mankind; leaving upon that\r\nhaloed spot a _biograph_ which the ages of time to come shall not\r\nwash out.\r\n\r\nFrom Chesterfield I diverged westward to see Chatsworth and Haddon\r\nHall.  Whoever makes this walk or ride, let him be sure to stop at\r\nWatch Hill on the way, and look at the view eastward.  It is grander\r\nthan that of Belvoir Vale, if not so beautiful.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure quite equal to my anticipation to visit Chatsworth\r\nfor the first time, after a sojourn in England, off and on, for\r\nsixteen years.  It is the lion number three, according to the\r\nAmerican ranking of the historical edifices and localities of\r\nEngland.  Stratford-upon-Avon, Westminster Abbey and Chatsworth are\r\nthe three representative celebrities which our travellers think they\r\nmust visit, if they would see the life of England's ages from the\r\nbest stand-points.  And this is the order in which they rank them.\r\nChatsworth and Haddon Hall should be seen the same day if possible;\r\nso that you may carry the impressions of the one fresh and active\r\ninto the other.  They are the two most representative buildings in\r\nthe kingdom.  Haddon is old English feudalism _edificed_.  It\r\nrepresents the rough grandeur, hospitality, wassail and rude romance\r\nof the English nobility five hundred years ago.  It was all in its\r\nglory about the time when Thomas-a-Becket the Magnificent used to\r\nentertain great companies of belted knights of the realm in a manner\r\nthat exceeded regal munificence in those days,--even directing fresh\r\nstraw to be laid for them on his ample mansion floor, that they\r\nmight not soil the bravery of their dresses when they bunked down\r\nfor the night.  The building is brimful of the character and history\r\nof that period.  Indeed, there are no two milestones of English\r\nhistory so near together, and yet measuring such a space of the\r\nnation's life and manners between them, as this hall and that of\r\nChatsworth.  It was built, of course, in the bow-and-arrow times,\r\nwhen the sun had to use the same missiles in shooting its barbed\r\nrays into the narrow apertures of old castles--or the stone coffins\r\nof fear-hunted knights and ladies, as they might be called.  What a\r\nmonument this to the dispositions and habits of the world, outside\r\nand inside, of that early time!  Here is the porter's or warder's\r\nlodge just inside the huge gate.  To think of a living being with a\r\nhuman soul in him burrowing in such a place!--a big, black\r\nsarcophagus without a lid to it, set deep in the solid wall.  Then\r\nthere is the chapel.  Compare it with that of Chatsworth, and you\r\nmay count almost on your fingers the centuries that have intervened\r\nbetween them.  It was new-roofed soon after the discovery of\r\nAmerica, and perhaps done up to some show of decency and comfort.\r\nBut how small and rude the pulpit and pews--looking like rough-\r\nboarded potato-bins!  Here is the great banquet-hall, full to\r\noverflowing with the tracks and cross-tracks of that wild, strange\r\nlife of old.  There is a fire-place for you, and a mark in the\r\nchimney-back of five hundred Christmas logs.  Doubtless this great\r\nstone pavement of a floor was carpeted with straw at these banquets,\r\nafter the illustrious Becket's pattern.  Here is a memento of the\r\nfeast hanging up at the top of the kitchenward door;--a pair of\r\nroughly-forged, rusty handcuffs amalgamated into one pair of jaws,\r\nlike a musk-rat trap.  What was the use of that thing, conductor?\r\n\"That, sir, they put the 'ands in of them as shirked and didn't\r\ndrink up all the wine as was poured into their cups, and there they\r\nmade them stand on tiptoe up against that door, sir, before all the\r\ncompany, sir, until they was ashamed of theirselves.\"  Descend into\r\nthe kitchen, all scarred with the tremendous cookery of ages.  Here\r\nthey roasted bullocks whole, and just back in that dark vault with a\r\nslit or two in it for the light, they killed and dressed them.\r\nThere are the relics of the shambles.  And here is the great form on\r\nwhich they cut them up into manageable pieces.  It would do you\r\ngood, you Young America, to see that form, and the cross-gashes of\r\nthe meat-axe in it.  It is the half of a gigantic English oak, which\r\nwas growing in Julius Caesar's time, sawed through lengthwise,\r\nmaking a top surface several feet wide, black and smooth as ebony.\r\nSome of the bark still clings to the under side.  The dancing hall\r\nis the great room of the building.  All that the taste, art and\r\nwealth of that day could do, was done to make it a splendid\r\napartment, and it would pass muster still as a comfortable and\r\nrespectable salon.  As we pass out, you may decipher the short\r\nprayer cut in the wasting stone of a side portal, \"GOD SAVE THE\r\nVERNONS!\"  I hope this prayer has been favorably answered; for\r\nhistory records much virtue in the family, mingled with some\r\nromantic escapades, which have contributed, I believe, to the\r\nentertainment of many novel readers.\r\n\r\nJust what Haddon Hall was to the baronial life and society of\r\nEngland five hundred years ago, is Chatsworth to the full stature of\r\nmodern civilization and aristocratic wealth, taste and position.  Of\r\nthis it is probably the best measure and representative in the\r\nkingdom; and as such it possesses a special value and interest to\r\nthe world at large.  Were it not for here and there such an\r\nestablishment, we should lack waymarks in the progress of the arts,\r\nsciences and tastes of advancing civilization.  Governments and\r\njoint-stock companies may erect and fill, with a world of utilities\r\nand curiosities of ancient and modern times, British Museums,\r\nNational Galleries, Crystal Palaces and Polytechnic Institutions;\r\nbut not one of these, nor the Louvre, nor Versailles, nor the\r\nTuileries can compete with one private mind, taste and will\r\nconcentrated upon one great work for a lifetime, when endowed with\r\nthe requisite perceptions and means competent to carry that work to\r\nthe highest perfection of science, genius and art.  Museums,\r\ngalleries and public institutions of art are exclusively _visiting_\r\nplaces.  The elegancies of _home_ life are all shut out of their\r\nattractions.  You see in them the work and presence of a committee,\r\nor corporation, often in discrepant layers of taste and plan.  One\r\nmind does not stand out or above the whole, fashioning the tout-\r\nensemble to the symmetrical lines of one governing, all-pervading\r\nand shaping thought.  You see no exquisite artistry of drawing-room\r\nor boudoir elegance and luxury running through living apartments of\r\nhome, out into the conservatories, lawns, gardens, park and all its\r\nsurroundings and embellishments, making the whole like a great\r\nilluminated volume of family life, which you may peruse page by\r\npage, and trace the same pen and the same story from beginning to\r\nend.  Even the grandest royal residences lack, in this quality, what\r\nyou will find at Chatsworth.  They all show the sharp-edged strata\r\nof unaffiliated tastes and styles of different ages and artists.\r\nThey lack the oneness of a single individuality, of one great\r\nsymmetrical conception.\r\n\r\nThis one-mindedness, this one-man power of conception and execution\r\ngives to the Duke of Devonshire's palace at Chatsworth an interest\r\nand a value that probably do not attach to any other private\r\nestablishment in England.  In this felicitous characteristic it\r\nstands out in remarkable prominence and in striking contrast with\r\nnearly all the other baronial halls of the country.  It is the\r\nparlor pier-glass of the present century.  It reflects the two\r\nimages in vivid apposition--the brilliant civilization of this last,\r\nunfinished age in which we live and the life of bygone centuries;\r\nthat is, if Haddon Hall shows its face in it, or if you have the\r\nfeatures of that antiquity before your eyes when you look into the\r\nChatsworth mirror.  The whole of this magnificent establishment\r\nbears the impress of the nineteenth century, inside and outside.\r\nThe architecture, sculpture, carving, paintings, engravings,\r\nfurniture, libraries, conservatories, flowers, shrubberies and\r\nrockeries all bear and honor the finger-prints of modern taste and\r\nart.  In no casket in England, probably, have so many jewels of this\r\ncentury's civilization been treasured for posterity as in this\r\nmansion on the little meandering Derwent.  If England has no grand\r\nNational Gallery like the French Louvre, she has works of art that\r\nwould fill fifty Louvres, collected and treasured in these quiet\r\nprivate halls, embosomed in green parks and plantations, from one\r\nend of the land to the other.  And in no other country are the\r\nprivate treasure-houses of genius so accessible to the public as in\r\nthis.  They doubtless act as educational centres for refining the\r\nhabits of the nation; exerting an influence that reaches and\r\nelevates the homes of the people, cultivating in them new\r\nperceptions of beauty and comfort; diffusing a taste for embowering\r\neven humble cottages in shrubbery; making little flower-fringed\r\nlawns, six feet by eight or less; rockeries and ferneries, and\r\nartificial ruins of castles or abbeys of smaller dimensions still.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the galleries and gardens of Chatsworth you will\r\nrecognise the originals of many works of art which command the\r\nadmiration of the world.  The most familiar to the American visitor\r\nwill probably be the great painting of the Bolton Abbey Scene, the\r\nengravings of which are so numerous and admired on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic.  But there is the original of a greater work, which has\r\nmade the wonder of the age.  It is the original of the Great Crystal\r\nPalace of 1851, and the mother of all the palaces of the same\r\nstructure which have been or will be erected in time past or to\r\ncome.  Here it diadems at Chatsworth the choice plants and flowers\r\nof all the tropics; presenting a model which needed only expansion,\r\nand some modifications, to furnish the reproduction that delighted\r\nthe world in Hyde Park in 1851.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly impressed with one feature of the economy that\r\nruled at Chatsworth.  Although there were between one and two\r\nthousand deer flecking the park, it was utilised to the pasture of\r\nhumbler and more useful animals.  Over one hundred poor people's\r\ncows were feeding demurely over its vast extent, even to the gilded\r\ngates of the palace.  They are charged only 2 pounds for the season;\r\nwhich is very moderate, even cheaper than the stony pasturage around\r\nthe villages of New England.  I noticed a flock of Spanish sheep,\r\nblack-and-white, looking like a drove of Berkshire hogs, and\r\nseemingly clothed with bristles instead of wool.  They are kept\r\nrather as curiosities than for use.\r\n\r\nChatsworth, with all its treasures and embodiments of wealth, art\r\nand genius, with an estate continuous in one direction for about\r\nthirty miles, is but one of the establishments of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire.  He owns a palace on the Thames that might crown the\r\nambition of a German prince.  He also counts in his possessions old\r\nabbeys, baronial halls, parks and towns that once were walled, and\r\nstill have streets called after their gates.  If any country is to\r\nhave a personage occupying such a position, it is well to have a\r\nconsiderable number of the same class, to yeomanise such an\r\naristocracy--to make each feel that he has his peers in fifty\r\nothers.  Otherwise an isolated duke would have to live and move\r\noutside the pale of human society; a proud, haughty entity dashing\r\nabout, with not even a comet's orbit nor any fixed place in the\r\nconstellation of a nation's communities.  It is of great necessity\r\nto him, independent of political considerations, that there is a\r\nHouse of Peers instituted, in which he may find his social level;\r\nwhere he may meet his equals in considerable numbers, and feel\r\nhimself but a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEFFIELD AND ITS INDIVIDUALITY--THE COUNTRY, ABOVE GROUND AND UNDER\r\nGROUND--WAKEFIELD AND LEEDS--WHARF VALE--FARNLEY HALL--HARROGATE;\r\nRIPLEY CASTLE; RIPON; CONSERVATISM OF COUNTRY TOWNS--FOUNTAIN ABBEY;\r\nSTUDLEY PARK--RIEVAULX ABBEY--LORD FAVERSHAM'S SHORT-HORN STOCK.\r\n\r\nFrom Chatsworth I went on to Sheffield, crossing a hilly moorland\r\nbelonging to the Duke of Rutland, and containing 10,000 acres in one\r\nsolid block.  It was all covered with heather, and kept in this\r\nwild, bleak condition for game.  Here and there well-cultivated\r\nfarms, as it were, bit into this cold waste, rescuing large, square\r\nmorsels of land, and making them glow with the warm flush and glory\r\nof luxuriant harvests; thus showing how such great reaches of desert\r\nmay be made to blossom like the rose under the hand of human labor.\r\n\r\nHere is Sheffield, down here, sweltering, smoking, and sweating,\r\nwith face like the tan, under the walls of these surrounding hills.\r\nHere live and labor Briareus and Cyclops of modern mythology.  Here\r\nthey--\r\n\r\n     Swing their heavy sledge,\r\n        With measured beats and slow;\r\n     Like the sexton ringing the village bell,\r\n        When the evening sun is low.\r\n\r\nHere live the lineal descendants of Thor, christianised to human\r\nindustries.  Here the great hammer of the Scandinavian Thunderer\r\ndescended, took nest, and hatched a brood of ten thousand little\r\niron beetles for beating iron and steel into shapes and uses that\r\nTubal Cain never dreamed of.  Here you may hear their clatter night\r\nand day upon a thousand anvils.  O, Vale of Vulcan!  O, Valley of\r\nKnives!  Was ever a boy put into trousers, in either hemisphere,\r\nthat did not carry in the first pocket made for him one of thy cheap\r\nblades?  Did ever a reaper in the Old World or New cut and bind a\r\nsheaf of grain, who did not wield one of thy famous sickles?  All\r\nAmericans who were boys forty years ago, will remember three English\r\ncentres of peculiar interest to them.  These were Sheffield,\r\nColebrook Dale, and Paternoster Row.  There was hardly a house or\r\nlog cabin between the Penobscot and the Mississippi which could not\r\nshow the imprint of these three places, on the iron tea-kettle, the\r\nyoungest boy's Barlow knife, and his younger sister's picture-book.\r\nTo the juvenile imagination of those times, Sheffield was a huge\r\njack-knife, Colebrook Dale a porridge-pot, and Paternoster Row a\r\npsalm-book, each in the generative case.  How we young reapers used\r\nto discuss the comparative merits and meanings of those mysterious\r\nletters on our sickles, B.Y and I.R!  What were they?  Were they\r\nbeginnings of words, or whole words themselves?  Did they stand for\r\nthings, qualities, or persons?  \"Mine is a _By_ sickle; mine is an\r\n_Ir_ one.  Mine is the best,\" says the last, \"for it has the finest\r\nteeth and the best curve.\"  That was our boys' talk in walking\r\nthrough the rye, with bent backs and red faces, a little behind our\r\nfathers; who cut a wider work to enable us to keep near them.\r\n\r\nIn what blacksmith shop or hardware house in America does not\r\nSheffield show its face and faculties?  Did any American, knowing\r\nthe difference between cast-iron and cast-steel, ever miss the sight\r\nof Naylor and Sanderson's yellow labels in his travels?  How many\r\nmillions of acres of primeval forest have the ages edged with their\r\nfine steel cut through, and given to the plough!  Fashion has its\r\nIron Age as well as its Golden; and, what is more remarkable, the\r\nfirst of the two has come last, in the fitful histories of custom.\r\nAnd this last freak of feminine taste has brought a wonderful grist\r\nof additional business to the Sheffield mill.  The fair Eugenie has\r\ndone a good thing for this smoky town, well deserving of a monument\r\nof burnished steel erected to her memory on one of these hills.\r\nMore than this; as Empress of Crinoline, she should wear the iron\r\ncrown of Charlemagne in her own right.  Her husband's empire is but\r\na mere arondissement compared with the domain that does homage to\r\nher sceptre.  Sheffield is the great arsenal of her armaments.\r\nSheffield cases ships of war with iron plates a foot thick; but that\r\nis nothing, in pounds avoirdupois, compared with the weight of steel\r\nit spins into elastic springs for casing the skirts of two hundred\r\nmillions of the fair Eugenie's sex and lieges in the two\r\nhemispheres.  It is estimated that ten thousand tons of steel are\r\nannually absorbed into this use in Christendom; and Sheffield,\r\ndoubtless, furnishes a large proportion of it.\r\n\r\nHere I had another involuntary walk, not put down in the programme\r\nof my expectations.  On inquiring the way to Fir Vale, a picturesque\r\nsuburb where a friend resided, I was directed to a locality which,\r\nit was suggested, must be the one I meant, though it was called Fir\r\nView.  I followed the direction given for a considerable distance,\r\nwhen it was varied successively by persons of whom I occasionally\r\ninquired.  After ascending and descending a number of steep hills, I\r\nsuddenly came down upon the town again from the south, having made a\r\ncomplete circuit of it; a performance that cost me about two hours\r\nof time and much unsatisfactory perspiration.  Fearing that a second\r\nattempt would be equally unsuccessful, I took the Leeds road, and\r\nleft the Jericho at the first round.  Walked about nine miles to a\r\nfurnace-lighted village called very appropriately Hoyland, or\r\nHighland, when anglicised from the Danish.  It commands truly a\r\ngrand view of wooded hills and deep valleys dashed with the sheen of\r\nripened grain.\r\n\r\nThe next day I passed through a good sample section of England's\r\nwealth and industry.  Mansions and parks of the gentry, hill,\r\nvalley, wheat-fields, meadows of the most vivid green; crops\r\nluxuriant in most picturesque alternations; in a word, the whole a\r\nvista of the richest agricultural scenery.  And yet out of the\r\nbrightest and broadest fields of wheat, barley and oats, towered up\r\nthe colliery chimneys in every direction, like good-natured and\r\nswarthy giants smoking their pipes complacently and \"with\r\ncomfortable breasts\" in view of the goodly scene.  The golden grain\r\ngrew thick and tall up to the very pit's mouth.  In the sun-light\r\nabove and gas-light below human industry was plying its differently-\r\nbitted implements.  There were men reaping and studding the pathway\r\nof their sickles through the field with thickly-planted sheaves.\r\nBut right under them, a hundred fathoms deep, subterranean farmers\r\nwere at work, with black and sweaty brows, garnering the coal-\r\nharvest sown there before the Flood.  Sickle above and pick below\r\nwere gathering simultaneously the layers of wealth that Nature had\r\nstored in her parlor and cellar for man.\r\n\r\nI passed through Barnsley and Wakefield on this day's walk,--towns\r\nfull of profitable industries and busy populations, and growing in\r\nboth after the American impulse and expansion.  If the good \"Vicar\r\nof Wakefield\" of the olden time could revisit the scene of his\r\nearthly experience, and look upon the old church of his ministry as\r\nit now appears, renovated from bottom to the top of its grand and\r\nlofty spire, he would not be entrapped again so easily into assent\r\nto the Greek apothegm of the swindler.\r\n\r\nI lodged at a little village inn between Wakefield and Leeds, after\r\na day of the most enjoyable walk that I had made.  Never before,\r\nbetween sun and sun, had I passed over such a section of above-\r\nground and under-ground industry and wealth.  The next morning I\r\ncontinued northward, and noticed still more striking combinations of\r\nnatural productions and human industries than on the preceding day.\r\nOne small, rural area in which these were blended impressed me\r\ngreatly, and I stopped to photograph the scene on my mind.  In a\r\ncircle hardly a third of a mile in diameter, there was the heaviest\r\ncrop of oats growing that I had yet seen in England; in another part\r\nof the same field there was a large brick-kiln; in another, an\r\nextensive quarry and machinery for sawing the stone into all sizes\r\nand shapes; then a furnace for casting iron, and lastly, a coal\r\nmine; and all these departments of labor and production were in full\r\noperation.  It is quite possible that not one of the hundred\r\nlaborers on and under this ten-acre patch ever thought it an\r\nextraordinary focus of production.  Perhaps even the proprietors and\r\nmanagers of the five different enterprises worked on the small space\r\nhad taken its rich and diversified fertilities as a matter of\r\ncourse, as we take the rain, light and heat of summer; but to a\r\ntraveller \"taking stock\" of a country's resources, it could not but\r\nbe a point of view exciting admiration.  I left it behind me deeply\r\nimpressed with the conviction that I had seen the most productive\r\nten-acre field that could be found on the surface of the globe,\r\ncounting in the variety and value of its surface and sub-surface\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nI took tea with a friend in Leeds, remaining only an hour or two in\r\nthat town, then pursuing my course northward.  The wide world knows\r\nso much of Leeds that any notice that I could give of it might seem\r\naffected and presumptuous.  It is to the Cloth-World what Rome is to\r\nthe Catholic.  Its Cloth Hall is the St. Peter's of Coat-and-\r\ntrouserdom.  Its rivers, streams and canals run black and blue with\r\nthe stringent juices of all the woods and weeds of the world used in\r\ndyeing.  The woods of all the continents come floating in here, like\r\nbaled summer clouds of heaven.  It is a city of magnipotent\r\nchimneys; and they stand thick and tall on the hills and in the\r\nvalleys around, and puff their black breathings into the face and\r\neyes of the sky above, baconising its countenance, and giving it no\r\ntime to wash up and look sober, calm and clean, except a few hours\r\non the sabbath.  The Leeds Mercury is a power in the land, and\r\neverybody who reads the English language in either hemisphere knows\r\nEdward Baines by name.\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the great, busy town on the north, I passed by the\r\nestates and residences of its manufacturing aristocracy.  The homes\r\nthey have built and embellished should satisfy the tastes and\r\nambitions of any hereditary nobility.  They need only a little more\r\nage to make them rival many baronial establishments.  It is\r\ninteresting to see how the different classes of society are stepping\r\ninto each other's shoes in going up into higher grades of social\r\nlife.  The merchant and manufacturing princes of England have not\r\nonly reached but surpassed the conditions of wealth, taste and\r\nelegance which the hereditary peers of the realm occupied a century\r\nago; while the latter have gone up to the rich and luxurious\r\nsurroundings of kings and queens of that period.  The upward\r\nmovement has reached the very lowest strata of society.  Not only\r\nhave the small tradesmen and farmers ascended to the comfortable\r\nconditions of large merchants and landowners of one hundred years\r\nago, but common day laborers are lifted upward by the general\r\nuprising.  I should not wonder if all the damp, low cellarless\r\ncottages they now frequently inhabit should be swept away in less\r\nthan fifty years and replaced by as comfortable buildings as the\r\ngreat middle class occupied in the childhood of the present\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nI found comfortable quarters for the night in the little village of\r\nBramhope, about five miles from Leeds.  The next day I walked to\r\nHarrogate, passing through Otley and across the celebrated Wharf\r\nVale.  The scenery of this valley, as it opens upon you suddenly on\r\ndescending from the south into Otley, is exceedingly beautiful; not\r\nso extensive as that of Belvoir Vale, but with all the features of\r\nthe latter landscape compressed in a smaller space; like a portrait\r\ntaken on a smaller scale.  As you look off from the southern ridge\r\nor wall of the valley, you seem to stand on the cord of a segment of\r\na circle, the radius of which touches the horizon at about five\r\nmiles to the north.  This crescent is filled with the most delicate\r\nlineaments of Nature's beauty.  The opposite walls of the gallery\r\nslope upward from the meandering Wharf so gently and yet reach the\r\nblue ceiling of the sky so near, that all the paintings that panel\r\nthem are vividly distinct to your eye, and you can group all their\r\nlights and shades in the compass of a single glance.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side, half hidden and half revealed among the trees\r\nof an ample park, stands Farnley Hall, a historical residence of an\r\nold historical family.  I had a letter of introduction to the\r\npresent proprietor, Mr. Fawkes, who, I hope, will not deem it a\r\ndisparagement to be called one of the Knights of the Shorthorns--a\r\nmore extensive, useful, and cosmopolitan order than were the Knights\r\nof Rhodes or of Malta.  Unfortunately for me, he was not at home;\r\nbut his steward, a very intelligent, gentlemanly and genial man,\r\ntook me over the establishment, and showed me all the stock that was\r\nstabled, mostly bulls of different ages.  They were all of the best\r\nfamilies of Shorthorn blood, and a better connoisseur of animal life\r\nthan myself could not have enjoyed the sight of such well-made\r\ncreatures more thoroughly than I did.  The prince of the blood, in\r\nmy estimation, was \"Lord Cobham,\" a cream-colored bull, with which\r\ncompared that famous animal in Greek mythology which played himself\r\noff as such an Adonis among the bovines, must have been a shabby,\r\nscraggy quadruped.  Poor Europa! it would have been bad enough if\r\nshe had been run away with by a \"Lord Cobham.\"  But the like of him\r\ndid not live in her day.\r\n\r\nAfter going through the housings for cattle, the steward took me to\r\nthe Hall, a grand old mansion full of English history, especially of\r\nthe Commonwealth period.  Indeed, one large apartment was a museum\r\nof relics of that stirring and stormy time.  There, against the\r\nantique, carved wainscoting, hung the great broad-brim of Oliver\r\nCromwell, with a circumference nearly as large as an opened\r\numbrella, heavy, coarse and grim.  There hung a sword he wielded in\r\nthe fiery rifts of battle.  There was Fairfax's sword hanging by its\r\nside; and his famous war-drum lay beneath.  Its leather lungs, that\r\nonce shouted the charge, were now still and frowsy, with no martial\r\nspeech left in them.\r\n\r\nMr. Fawkes owns about 15,000 acres of land, including most of the\r\nvalley of Otley, and extending back almost to Harrogate.  He farms\r\nabout 450 acres, but grows no wheat.  Indeed, I did not see a field\r\nof it in a circle of five miles' diameter.\r\n\r\nI reached Harrogate in the dusk of the evening, and found the town\r\nalive with people mostly in the streets.  It is a snug and cozy\r\nlittle Saratoga among the hills of Yorkshire, away from the smoke,\r\nsoot and savor of the great manufacturing centres.  It is a favorite\r\nresort for a mild class of invalids, and of persons who need the\r\nmedicine of pure air and gentle exercise, blended with the quiet\r\ntonics of cheery mirth and recreation.  Superadded to all these\r\nstimulants, there is a mineral spring at which the visitors, young\r\nand old, drink most voluminously.  I went down to it in the morning\r\nbefore breakfast, and found it thronged by a multitude of men, women\r\nand children, who drank off great goblets of it with astonishing\r\nfaith and facility.  The rotunda was so filled with the fumes of\r\nsulphur that I found it more easy to inhale than to imbibe, and\r\npreferred to satisfy that sense as to the merits of the water.\r\n\r\nThe next day I reached the brave old city of Ripon.  On the way I\r\nstopped an hour or two at Ripley and visited the castle.  The\r\nbuilding itself is a good specimen of the baronial hall of the olden\r\ntime.  But the gardens and grounds constitute its distinguishing\r\nfeature.  I never saw before such an exquisite arrangement of\r\nflowers, even at Chatsworth or the Kew Gardens.  All forms\r\nimaginable were produced by them.  The most extensive and elaborate\r\ncombination was a row of flower sofas reaching around the garden.\r\nEach was from 20 to 30 feet in length.  The seat was wrought in\r\ngeraniums of every tint, all grown to an even, compact surface,\r\npresenting figures as diversified as the alternating hues could\r\nproduce.  The back was worked in taller flowers, presenting the same\r\nevenness of line and surface.  On entering the garden gate and\r\ncatching the first sight of these beautiful structures, you take\r\nthem for veritable sofas, as perfectly wrought as anything was ever\r\ndone in Berlin wool.\r\n\r\nRipon is an interesting little city, with a fact-roll of history\r\nreaching back into the dimmest centuries of the land.  It has run\r\nthe gauntlet of all the Saxon, Danish, Scotch and Norman raids and\r\nregimes.  It was burnt once or twice by each of these races in the\r\nstruggle for supremacy.  But with a plucky tenacity of life, it\r\narose successively out of its own ashes and spread its phoenix wings\r\nto a new and vigorous vitality.  A venerable cathedral looks down\r\nupon it with a motherly face.  Unique old buildings, with half their\r\ncenturies unrecorded and lost in oblivion, stand to this day in good\r\nrepair, as the homes of happy children, who play at marbles and the\r\nlast sports of the day just as if they were born in houses only a\r\nyear older than themselves.  Institutions and customs older than the\r\ncathedral are kept up with a filial faith in their virtue.  One of\r\nthe most interesting of these, I believe, was established by the\r\nSaxon Edgar or Alfred--it matters not which; they were only a\r\ncentury or two apart, and that space is but a trifling circumstance\r\nin the history of this old country.  One of these kings appointed an\r\nofficer called a \"wakeman\" for the town.  He must originally have\r\nbeen a kind of secular beadle of the community, or a curfew\r\nconstable, to see the whole population well a-bed in good season.\r\nOne of his duties consisted in blowing a horn every night at nine\r\no'clock as a signal to turn in.  But a remarkable consideration was\r\nattached to faithful compliance with this summons.  If any house or\r\nshop was robbed before sunrise, a tax was levied upon every\r\ninhabitant, of 4d. if his house had one outer door, and of 8d. if it\r\nhad two.  This tax was to compensate the sufferer for his loss, and\r\nalso to put the whole community under bonds to keep the peace and to\r\nfeel responsible for the safety of each other's property.  Thus it\r\nnot only acted as a great mutual insurance company of which every\r\nhouseholder was a member, but it made him, as it were, a special\r\nconstable against burglary.  This old Saxon institution is in full\r\nlife and vigor to-day.  The wakeman is still the highest secular\r\nofficial of the town.  For a thousand consecutive years the\r\nwakeman's toot-horn has been blown at night over the successive\r\ngenerations of the little cathedral city.  This is an interesting\r\nfact, full of promise.  No American could fail to admire this\r\nconservatism who appreciates national individuality.  No one, at\r\nheart, could more highly esteem these salient traits of a people's\r\ncharacter.  And here I may as well put in a few thoughts on this\r\nsubject as at any stage of my walk.\r\n\r\nGood-natured reader, are you a man of sensitive perceptions as to\r\nthe proprieties and dignities of dress and deportment which should\r\ncharacterise some great historical personage whose name you have\r\nheld in profound veneration all your life long?  Now, in the wayward\r\ndrift of your imagination among the freaks of modern fashion, did it\r\never dare to present before your eyes St. Paul in strapped\r\npantaloons, figured velvet vest, swallow-tailed coat, stove-pipe\r\nhat, and a cockney glass at his eye?  Did your fancy, in its wildest\r\nfictions, ever pass such an image across the speculum of your mental\r\nvision?\r\n\r\nGentle reader, \"in maiden meditation, fancy free,\" did a dreamy\r\nthought of yours ever stray through the histories of your sex and\r\nits modes of dress and adornment, and so blend or transpose them as\r\nto present to you, in a sudden flash of the imagination, the Virgin\r\nMary dressed like the Empress Eugenie?  Readers both, did not that\r\nfancy trouble you, as if an unholy thought had fallen into the soul?\r\nWell, a thought like that must trouble the American when his fancy\r\npasses before his mind's eye the image of Old England Americanised.\r\nAnd a faculty more serious and trusty than fancy will present this\r\ntransformation to him, day by day, as he visits the great centres of\r\nthe nation's life and industry.  In London, Manchester, Liverpool,\r\nand all the most busy and prosperous commercial and manufacturing\r\ntowns, he will see that England is becoming Americanised shockingly\r\nfast.  In all these populous places it is losing the old\r\nindividuality that once distinguished the grandfatherland of fifty\r\nmillions who now speak its language beyond the sea.  Look at London!\r\nlook at the miles of three and four story houses under the mason's\r\nhands, now running out in every direction from the city.  Will you\r\nsee a single feature of the Old England of our common memories in\r\nthem?  No, not one! no more than in a modern English dress-coat, or\r\nin one of the iron rails of the British Great Western, or of the\r\nIllinois Central.  It is doubtful if there will be anything of\r\nEngland left in London at the end of the next fifty years, unless it\r\nbe the fog and the Lord Mayor's Show.  Already the radicals are\r\ncrying out against both of these institutions, which are merely\r\nlocal, by the way.  The tailor's shears, the mason's trowel, and the\r\ncarpenter's edge-tools are evening everything in Christendom to one\r\ndead level of uniformity.  The railroads and telegraphs are all\r\nworking to the same end.  All these agencies of modern civilization\r\nat first lay their innovating hands upon large cities or commercial\r\ncentres.  Thence they work outward slowly and transform the\r\nappearance and habits of the country.  The transformations I have\r\nnoticed in England since 1846 are wonderful, utilitarian, and\r\nproductive of absolute and rigid comfort to the people; still, I\r\nmust confess, they inspire in me a sentiment akin to that which our\r\nvillage fathers experienced when the old church in which they\r\nworshipped from childhood was pulled down to make room for a better\r\none.\r\n\r\nTo every American, sympathising with these sentiments, it must be\r\ninteresting to visit such a rural little city as Ripon, and find\r\npopulations that cling with reverence and affection to the old Saxon\r\ninstitutions of Alfred.  It will make him feel that he stands in the\r\nunbroken lineage of the centuries, to hear the wakeman's horn, and\r\nto know that it has been blown, spring, summer, autumn and winter,\r\nin all weathers, in weal and in woe, for a thousand years.  As Old\r\nEngland is driven farther and farther back from London, Manchester,\r\nLiverpool, and other great improving towns, she will find refuge and\r\nresidence in these retired country villages.  Here she will wear\r\nlongest and last the features in which she was engraven on the minds\r\nof all the millions who call her mother beyond the sea.\r\n\r\nThe next day I visited the celebrated Fountain Abbey in Studley\r\nPark,--a grand relic of antiquity, framed with silver and emerald\r\nwork of lakelets, lawns, shrubberies and trees as beautifully\r\narranged as art, taste and wealth could set them.  The old abbey is\r\na majestic ruin which fills one with wonder as he looks up at its\r\nbroken arches and towers and sees the dimensions marked by the\r\npedestals or foot-prints of its templed columns.  It stands rather\r\nin a narrow glen than in a valley, and was commenced, it is\r\nsupposed, about 1130.  The yew-trees under which the monks\r\nbivouacked while at work upon the magnificent edifice, are still\r\nstanding, bearing leaves as large and green as those that covered\r\nthe enthusiastic architects of that early time.  In the height of\r\nits prosperity and power, the lands of the abbey embraced over\r\n72,000 acres.  The Park enclosing this great monument of an earlier\r\nage contains 250 acres, and is really an earthly elysium of beauty.\r\nIt was comforting to learn that it was laid out so late as 1720, and\r\nthat all the noble trees that filled it had grown to their present\r\ngrandeur within the intervening period.  Here I saw for the first\r\ntime in England our hard-maple.  It was a spindling thing, looking\r\nas if it had suffered much from fever and ague or rheumatism; but it\r\nwas pleasant to see it admitted into a larger fellowship of trees\r\nthan our New England soil ever bore.  On a green, lawn-faced slope,\r\nat the turning of the principal walk, there was a little tree a few\r\nfeet high enclosed in by a circular wire fence.  It was planted by\r\nthe Princess of Wales on a visit of the royal pair to Studley soon\r\nafter their marriage.  The fair Dane left her card in this way to\r\nthe old Abbey, which began to rise upon its foundations soon after\r\nthe stalwart Danish sovereign of England fell at the Battle of\r\nHastings.  Will any one of her posterity ever bear his name and sit\r\nupon the throne he vacated for that bloody grave?  No!  She will\r\nremember a better name at the font.  The day and the name of the\r\nHarolds, Williams, Henrys, Charles's, and Georges are over and gone\r\nforever.  ALBERT THE GOOD has estopped that succession; and England,\r\ndoubtless, for centuries to come, will wear that name and its\r\nmemories in her crown.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few hours at Studley Park, I returned to Ripon and\r\nwent on to Thirsk, where I spent the Sabbath with a Friend.  The\r\nnext day he drove me over to Rievaulx Abbey, which was the mother of\r\nFountain Abbey.  On the way to it we passed the ruins of another of\r\nthese grand structures of that religious age, called Byland Abbey,\r\nwhere Robert Bruce came within an ace of capturing King Edward on\r\nhis retreat from Scotland, after the Battle of Bannockburn.\r\n\r\nOne of the objects of this excursion was to visit the establishment\r\nof Lord Faversham, near Helmsley, who is one of the most scientific\r\nand successful stock-raisers, of the Shorthorn blood, in England,\r\nand to whom I had a note of introduction.  But he, too, was not at\r\nhome, which I much regretted, as I was desirous of seeing one of the\r\npeers of the realm who enter into this culture of animal life with\r\nso much personal interest and assiduity.  His manager, however, was\r\nvery affable and attentive, ready and pleased to give any\r\ninformation desired upon different points.  He showed us a splendid\r\nset of animals.  Indeed, I had never seen a herd to equal it.  There\r\nwere several bulls of different ages with a perfection of form truly\r\nadmirable.  Some of them had already drawn first prizes at different\r\nshows.  Several noble specimens of this celebrated herd have been\r\nsold to stock-raisers in America, Australia and in continental\r\ncountries.  The most perfect of all the well-made animals on the\r\nestablishment, according to my untrained perceptions of symmetry,\r\nwas a milk-white cow, called \"The Lady in White,\" three years old.\r\nShe and Mr. Fawkes' \"Lord Cobham\" should be shown together.  I doubt\r\nif a better mated pair could be found in England.  There was a large\r\nnumber of cows feeding in the park which would command admiration at\r\nany exhibition of stock.  Lord Faversham's famous \"Skyrocket\" ended\r\nhis days with much eclat.  When getting into years, and into\r\nmonstrous obesity, he was presented as a contribution to the\r\nLancashire Relief Fund.  Before passing into the butcher's hands, he\r\nwas exhibited in Leeds, and realised about 200 pounds as a show.\r\nThus as a curiosity first, and as a small mountain of fat beef\r\nafterward, he proved a generous gift to the suffering operatives in\r\nthe manufacturing districts.\r\n\r\nPassing through the park gate, we entered upon a lawn esplanade\r\nlooking down upon the ruins of Rievaulx Abbey.  This broad terrace\r\nextended for apparently a half of a mile, and was as finely carpeted\r\npiece of ground as you will find in England.  No hair of horse or\r\ndog groomed and brushed with the nicest care, and soft and shining\r\nwith the healthiest vitality, could surpass in delicacy and life of\r\nsurface the grass coverlet of this long terrace, from which you\r\nlooked down upon that grand monument of twelfth-century architecture\r\nhalf veiled among the trees of the glen.  This was one of the oldest\r\nabbeys in the north of England, and the mother of several of them.\r\nSome of its walls are still as entire and perfect as those of\r\nTintern, on the Wye.  It was founded by the monks of the St. Bernard\r\norder, in 1131, according to the historical record.  Really those\r\nblack-cowled masons and carvers must have given the enthusiasm and\r\ngenius of the early painters of the Virgin to these magnificent\r\nstructures.  I will not go into the subject at large here, leaving\r\nit to form an entire chapter, when I have seen most of the old\r\nabbeys of the country.  In looking up at their walls, arches and\r\ncolumns, one marvels to see the most delicate and elaborate vine and\r\nflower-work of the carver's chisel apparently as perfect as when it\r\nengraved the last line; and this, too, in face of the frosts and\r\nbeating storms of six hundred years.  The largest ivy I ever saw\r\nbuttressed one of the windowed walls with ten thousand cross-folded\r\nfingers and foliage of vivid green piled thick and high upon the\r\nteeth-marks of time.  The trunk was a full foot through at the butt.\r\nA few years ago a large mound was uncovered near the ruin, and found\r\nto be composed of cinders, showing incontestably that the monks had\r\nworked iron ore very extensively, thus teaching the common people\r\nthat art as well as agriculture.  These cinders have been used very\r\nlargely in repairing the roads for a considerable distance around.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Thirsk over the Hambleton range of hills, we crossed\r\nthousands of acres of moor-land covered with heather in full bloom,\r\nlooking like a purple sea.  It was a splendid sight.  My friend, who\r\nwas an artist, stopped for a while to sketch one or two views of the\r\nscene.  As we proceeded, we saw several green and golden fields\r\nimpinging upon this florid waste, serving to illustrate what might\r\nbe done with the vast tracts of land in England and Scotland now\r\nbristling with this thick and prickly vegetation.  The heatherland\r\nover which we were passing was utilised in a rather singular manner.\r\nIt yielded pasturage to two sets of industrials--sheep and bees.  As\r\nthe heather blossom is thought to impart a peculiarly pleasant\r\nflavor to honey, I was told many bee-stock-raisers of Lincolnshire\r\nbrought their hives to this section to pasture them for a season on\r\nthis purple prairie.\r\n\r\nThe westward view from the precipitous heights of the Hambleton\r\nridge is one of the most beautiful and extensive you will find in\r\nEngland, well worth a special journey to see it.  The declining sun\r\nwas flooding the great basin with the day's last, best smile,\r\nfilling it to the golden rim of the horizon with a soft light in\r\nwhich lay a landscape of thirty miles' depth, embracing full fifty\r\nvillages and hamlets, parks, plantations and groves, all looking\r\n\"like emeralds chased in gold.\"  On the whole, I am inclined to\r\nthink many tourists would regard this view as even superior to that\r\nof Belvoir Vale.  It might be justly placed between that and Wharf\r\nVale.\r\n\r\nA London gentleman produced a most unique picture on the forehead of\r\none of these hills, which may be seen at a great distance.  In the\r\nfirst place, he had a smooth, lawn-like surface prepared on the\r\nsteep slope.  Then he cut out the form of a horse in the green turf,\r\nsowing the whole contour of the animal with lime.  This brought out\r\nin such bold relief the body and limbs, that, at several miles\r\ndistance, you seem to see a colossal white horse standing on his\r\nfour legs, perfect in form and feature, even to ear and nostril.\r\nThe symmetry is perfect, although the body, head, legs and tail\r\ncover a space of _four_ acres!\r\n\r\nThe next day I took staff for Northallerton, reaching that town\r\nabout the middle of the afternoon.  Passed through a highly\r\ncultivated district, and saw, for the first time, several reaping\r\nmachines at work in the fields.  I was struck at the manner in which\r\nthey were used.  I have noticed a peculiarity in reaping in this\r\nsection which must appear singular to an American.  The men cut\r\ninward instead of outward, as with us.  And these machines were\r\nfollowing the same rule!  As they went around the field, they were\r\nfollowed or rather met by men and women, each with an allotted beat,\r\nwho rushed in behind and gathered up the fallen from the standing\r\ngrain so as to make a clear path for the next round.  There seemed\r\nto be no reason for this singular and awkward practice, except the\r\nadhesion to an old custom of reaping.  The grain was not very stout,\r\nnor was it lodged.\r\n\r\nFrom Northallerton I hastened on to Newcastle-upon-Tyne in order to\r\nattend, for the first time in my life, the meetings of the British\r\nAssociation.  I reached that town on the 25th of August, and\r\nremained there a week, enjoying one of the greatest treats that ever\r\nfell to my lot.  I will reserve a brief description of it for a\r\nseparate chapter at the end of this volume, if my Notes on other\r\nmatters do not crowd it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEXHAM--THE NORTH TYNE--BORDER-LAND AND ITS SUGGESTIONS--HAWICK--\r\nTEVIOTDALE--BIRTH-PLACE OF LEYDEN--MELROSE AND DRYBURGH ABBEYS--\r\nABBOTSFORD:  SIR WALTER SCOTT; HOMAGE TO HIS GENIUS--THE FERRY AND\r\nTHE OAR-GIRL--NEW FARM STEDDINGS--SCENERY OF THE TWEED VALLEY--\r\nEDINBURGH AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Sept. 3rd, I left Newcastle, and proceeded first\r\nwestward to the old town of Hexham, with the view of taking a more\r\ncentral route into Scotland.  Here, too, are the ruins of one of the\r\nmost ancient of the abbeys.  The parish church wears the wrinkles of\r\nas many centuries as the oldest in the land.  Indeed, the town is\r\nfull of antiquities of different dates and races,--Roman, Scotch,\r\nSaxon, Danish and Norman.  They all left the marks of their glaived\r\nhands upon it.\r\n\r\nFrom Hexham I faced northward and followed the North Tyne up through\r\na very picturesque and romantic valley, thickly wooded and studded\r\nwith baronial mansions, parks, castles and residences of gentry,\r\nwith comfortable farm-houses looking sunny and cheerful on the green\r\nhill slopes and on the quiet banks of the river.  I saw fields of\r\nwheat quite green, looking as if they needed another month's sun to\r\nfit them for harvesting.  Lodged in a little village about eight\r\nmiles from Hexham.  The next day walked on to the little hamlet of\r\nFallstones, a distance of about twenty miles.  As I ascended the\r\nvalley, the scene changed rapidly.  The river dwindled to a narrow\r\nstream.  The hills that walled it in on either side grew higher and\r\nbalder, and the clouds lay cold and dank upon their bleak and sullen\r\nbrows.  The hamlets edged in here and there grew thinner, smaller\r\nand shabbier.  The road was barred and gated about once in a mile,\r\nto keep cattle and sheep from wandering; there being no fences nor\r\nhedges running parallel with it.  In a word, the premonitory\r\nsymptoms of a bare border-land thickened at every turn.\r\n\r\nAnother day brought me into the midst of a wild region, which might\r\nbe called No-man's-land; although most of it belongs to the Duke of\r\nNorthumberland.  It is all in the solitary grandeur of heather-\r\nhaired hills, which tinge, with their purple flush, the huge, black-\r\nwinged clouds that alight upon them.  Only here and there a\r\nshepherd's cottage is to be seen half way up the heights, or\r\nsheltering itself in a clump of trees in glen or gorge, like a\r\nbenighted traveller bivouacking for a night in a desert.  Sheep, of\r\nthe Cheviot breed mostly, are nearly the sole inhabitants and\r\nindustrials of this mountainous waste.  They climb to the highest\r\npeaks and bring down the white wealth of their wool to man.  It was\r\npleasant to see them like walking mites, flecking the dark brows of\r\nthe mountains.  They made a picture; they made a tableau vivant of\r\nthe same illustration as Landseer's lamb looking into the grass-\r\ncovered cannon's mouth.\r\n\r\nThis is the Border-land!  Here the fiercest antagonisms of hostile\r\nnationalities met in deadly conflict.  Fire and blood, rapine and\r\nwrath blackened and reddened and ravaged for centuries across this\r\nbleak territory.  Robber-chieftains and knighted free-booters\r\ncarried on their guerilla raids backward and forward, under the\r\ncounterfeited banner of patriotism.  Scotch and English armies led\r\nby kings marched and counter-marched over this sombre boundary.\r\nNever before was there one apparently more insoluble as a barrier\r\nbetween two peoples.  Never before in Christendom was there one that\r\nrequired a longer space of time to melt.  Never before did the\r\nfusing of two nationalities encounter more fierce and prolonged\r\nopposition.  Did ever patriotism pour out a swifter and deeper tide\r\nof chivalrous sentiment against merging one in another?--against\r\nuniting two thrones and two peoples in one?  Did patriotism ever\r\nfight bloodier battles to prevent such a union, or cling to local\r\nsovereignty with a more desperate hold?\r\n\r\nThis is the Border-land!  Look up the purpled steeps of these\r\nheathered hills.  The white lambs are looking, with their soft, meek\r\neyes, into the grass-choked mouths of the rusty and dismantled\r\ncannon of the war of nationalities between England and Scotland.\r\nThe deed has been consummated.  The valor and patriotism of Wallace\r\nand Bruce could not prevent it.  The sheep of English and Scotch\r\nshepherds feed side by side on these mountain heights, in spite of\r\nStirling and Bannockburn, of Flodden and Falkirk.  The Iron Horse,\r\nbearing the blended arms of the two realms on his shield, walks over\r\nthose battle-fields by night and day, treading their memories deeper\r\nand deeper in the dust.  The lambs are playing in the sun on the\r\nboundary line of the two dominions.  Does a Scot of to-day love his\r\nnative land less than the Campbell clansman or clan-chief in Bruce's\r\ntime?  Not a whit.  He carries a heartful of its choicest memories\r\nwith him into all countries of his sojourning.  But there is a\r\nlarger sentiment that includes all these filial feelings towards his\r\nmotherland, while it draws additional warmth and strength from them.\r\nIt is the sentiment of Imperial Nationality; the feeling of a\r\nBriton, that does not extinguish nor absorb, nor compete with, the\r\nScot in his heart;--the feeling that he is a political constituent\r\nof a mighty nation, whose feet stand upon all the continents of the\r\nearth, while it holds the best islands of the sea in its hands;--the\r\nfeeling with which he says _We_ with all the millions of a dominion\r\non which the sun never sets, and _Our_, when he speaks of its grand\r\nand common histories, its hopes, prospects, progress, power and\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\nThere was a Border-land, dark and bloody, between Saxon England and\r\nCeltic Wales.  For centuries the red foot-marks of savage conflict\r\nscarred and covered its wild waste.  Never before did so small a\r\npeople make so stout, and desperate and protracted struggle for\r\nlocal independence and isolation.  Never did one produce a more\r\nstrong-hearted and blind-eyed patriotism, or patriotism more poets\r\nto thrill the listeners to their lays with the intoxicating\r\nfanaticism of a national sentiment.  On that Border-land the white\r\nlambs now lie in the sun.  The Welsh sentiment is as strong as ever\r\nin the Snowdon shepherd, and he may not speak a dozen words of the\r\nEnglish tongue.  But the Briton lives in his breast.  The feeling of\r\nits great meaning surrounds and illumines the inner circles of his\r\nlocal attachment.  He may never have seen a map of the Globe, and\r\nnever have been outside the wall of the Welsh mountains; but he\r\nknows, without geography, who and what Queen Victoria is among the\r\nearth's sovereigns, and the length and breadth of her sceptre's\r\nreach and rule around the world.\r\n\r\nThere was a Border-land between Britain and Ireland, blackened and\r\nscarred by more burning antagonisms than those that once divided the\r\nlarger island.  The record of several consecutive centuries is\r\ngraven deep in it by the brand and bayonet, and by the more incisive\r\nteeth-marks of hate.  The slumbering antipathies of race and\r\nreligion even now crop out here and there, over the unfused\r\nboundary, in hissing tongues of flame.  The Briton and the Celt are\r\nstill struggling for the precedence in the Irishman's breast; but it\r\nis not a war of extermination.  His ardent nature is given to\r\nmartial memories, and all the battles he boasts of are British\r\nbattles, in which he or his father played the hero number one.  The\r\nhistory of independent Ireland is poor and thin; still he holds it\r\nback in his heart, and hesitates to link it with the great annals of\r\nthe \"Saxon\" realm, and thus make of both one grand and glorious\r\nrecord, present and future.  He cannot yet make up his mind to say\r\n_We_ with all the other English-speaking millions of the empire, as\r\nthe Scotsman and Welshman have learned and loved to say it.  He\r\ncannot as yet say _Our_ with them with such a sentiment of joint-\r\ninterest, when the histories, hopes, expansion and capacities of\r\nthat empire unroll their vista before him.  But the rains and the\r\ndews of a milder century are falling upon this Border-land.  The\r\nlava of spent volcanoes that covered it is taking soil and seed of\r\ngreen vegetation.  The white lambs shall yet lie on it in the sun.\r\n\r\nWhat a volume might be filled with the succinctest history of the\r\nBorder-lands of Christendom!  France was intersected with them for\r\ncenturies.  Seemingly they were as implacable and obdurate as any\r\nthat ever divided the British isle.  Local patriotism wrote poetry\r\nand shed blood voluminously to prevent the fusion of these old\r\nlandmarks of pigmy nationalities.  It took nearly a thousand years\r\nto complete the blending; to make the _we_ and the _our_ of one\r\ngreat consolidated empire the largest political sentiment of the men\r\nof Normandy, Burgundy or Navarre.  Long and fierce, and seemingly\r\nendless was the struggle; but at last, on all those old obstinate\r\nboundaries of hostile principalities, the white lambs lay in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThere are Border-lands now in the south and east of Europe foaming\r\nand seething with the same antagonisms of race and language; and\r\nChristendom is tremulous with their emotion.  It is the same old\r\nstruggle over again; and yet ninety-nine in a hundred of intelligent\r\nand reading people, with the history of British and French Border-\r\nlands before them, seem to think that a new and strange thing has\r\nhappened under the sun.  Full that proportion of our English-\r\nspeaking race, in both hemispheres, closing the volume of its own\r\nannals, have made up their minds to the belief that these Border-\r\nlands between German and Magyar, Teuton and Latin, Russ and Pole,\r\nbristle with antagonisms the like of which never were subdued, and\r\nnever ought to be subdued by human means or motives.  To them,\r\nnaturally, the half century of this hissing and seething,\r\ninsurrection and repression, is longer than the five hundred years\r\nand more it took to fuse into one the nationalities of England and\r\nWales.  What a point of space is a century midway between the ninth\r\nand nineteenth!  Few are long-sighted enough in historic vision to\r\ntouch that point with a cambric needle.  It may seem unfeeling to\r\nsay it or think it; still it is as true as the plainest history of\r\nthe last millenium.  There is a patriotism that looks at the future\r\nthrough a gimlet hole, and sees in it but a single star.  That\r\npatriotism is a natural, and most popular sentiment.  It was strong\r\nin the Welshman's breast a thousand years ago, and in the Scotsman's\r\nhalf that distance back in the past.  But it is a patriotism that\r\nhas its day and its rule; then both its eyes are opened, and it\r\nlooks upon the firmament of the future broadside on, and sees a\r\nconstellation where it once saw and half worshipped a solitary star.\r\nBetter to be the part of a great WHOLE than the whole of a little\r\n_nothing_.\r\n\r\nThese continental Border-lands may see the face of their future\r\nhistory in the mirror of England's annals.  They are quaking now\r\nwith the impetuous emotions of local nationality.  They are\r\nblackened and scarred in the contest for the Welsh and Scotch\r\nindependence of centuries agone.  But over those boundary wastes the\r\ngrass shall yet grow soft, fair and green, and there, too, the white\r\nlambs shall lie in the sun.\r\n\r\nMy walk lay over the most inhospitable and unpeopled section I ever\r\nsaw.  Calling at a station on the railway that passes through it, I\r\nwas told by the master that the nearest church or chapel was sixteen\r\nmiles in one direction, and over twenty in another.  It is doubtful\r\nif so large a churchless space could be found in Iowa or even\r\nKansas.  I was glad to reach Hawick, a good, solid town but a little\r\nway inside of the Scottish border, where I spent the sabbath and the\r\nfollowing Monday.  This was a rallying and sallying point in the old\r\nBorder Wars, and was inundated two or three times by the flux and\r\nreflux of this conflict, having been burnt twice, and put under the\r\nordeal of other calamities brought upon it when free-booting was\r\nboth the business, occupation and pastime of knighted chieftains and\r\ntheir clansmen.  It is now a thrifty, manufacturing town, lying in\r\nthe trough of the sea, or of the lofty hills that resemble waves\r\nhardened to earth in their crests.  Just opposite the Temperance Inn\r\nin which I had my quarters, was the Tower Hotel, once a palatial\r\nmansion of the Buccleuchs.  There the Duchess of Monmouth used to\r\nhold her drawing-rooms in an apartment which many a New England\r\njourneyman mechanic would hardly think ample and comfortable enough\r\nfor his parlor.  There is a curious conical mound in the town,\r\ncalled the Moat-hill, which looks like a great, green carbuncle.  It\r\nis thought by some to be a Druidical monument, but is quite involved\r\nin a mystery which no one has satisfactorily solved.  It is strange\r\nthat no persistent and successful effort has been made to let day-\r\nlight through it.  Some workmen a long time ago undertook to\r\nperforate it, but were frightened away by a thunder-storm, which\r\nthey seemed to take as a reproof and threatened punishment for their\r\nprofanity.  The great business of Hawick is the manufacture of a\r\nwoollen fabric called _Tweeds_.  It came to this name in a singular\r\nway.  The clerk of the factory made out an invoice of the first lot\r\nto a London house under the name of _Twilled_ goods.  The London man\r\nread it _Tweeds_, instead of Twilled, and ever since they have gone\r\nby that title.  As Sir Walter Scott was at that time making the name\r\n\"Tweed\" illustrious, the mistake was a very lucrative one to the\r\nmanufacturers of the article.  Here, too, in this border town\r\ncommences the chain of birthplaces of eminent men, who have honored\r\nScotland with their lives and history.  Here was born James Wilson,\r\nonce the editor of The Economist, who worked his way up, through\r\nintermediate positions of public honor and trust, to that of Finance\r\nMinister for India, and died at the meridian of his manhood in that\r\ncountry of dearly-bought distinctions.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 8th, I commenced my walk northward from this\r\nthreshold town of Scotland.  Followed down the Teviot to Denholm,\r\nthe birth-place of the celebrated poet and linguist, Dr. John\r\nLeyden, another victim who offered himself a sacrifice to the costly\r\nhonors and emoluments of East Indian official life.  One great\r\nthought fired his soul in all the perils and privations of that\r\ndeadly climate.  It was to ascend one niche higher in knowledge of\r\noriental tongues than Sir William Jones.  He labored to this end\r\nwith a desperate assiduity that perhaps was never surpassed or even\r\nequalled.  He died hugging the conviction that he had attained it.\r\nThis little village was his birthplace.  Here he wrote his first\r\nrhymes, and wooed and won the first inspirations of the muse.  His\r\nheart, as its last pulses grew weaker and slower, in that far-off\r\nheathen land, took on its child-thoughts again and its child-\r\nmemories; and his last words were about this little, rural hamlet\r\nwhere he was born.  A beautiful monument has been erected to his\r\nmemory in the centre of the large common around which the village is\r\nbuilt.  On each of the four sides of the monument there is a tribute\r\nto his name and worth; one from Sir Walter Scott, and one taken from\r\nhis own poems, entitled \"Scenes of my Infancy,\" a touching appeal to\r\nhis old friends and neighbors to hold him in kind remembrance.\r\n\r\nAll this section is as fertile as it can be in the sceneries and\r\nhistorical associations favorable for inspiring a strong-hearted\r\nlove of country, and for the development of the poetry of romantic\r\npatriotism.  It was pleasant to emerge from the dark, cold, barren\r\nborder-land, from the uncivilized mountains, standing sullen in the\r\nwild, shaggy chevelure of nature, and to walk again between towering\r\nhills dressed in the best toilet of human industry, crowned with\r\ngolden wheatfields, and zoned with broad girdles of the greenest\r\nvegetation.  It is when these contrasts are suddenly and closely\r\nbrought within the same vista that one sees and feels how the\r\nCreator has honored the labor of human hands, and lifted it up into\r\npartnership with His omnipotences in chronicling the consecutive\r\ncenturies of the earth in illuminated capitals of this joint\r\nhandwriting.  It is a grand and impressive sight--one of those dark-\r\nbrowed hills of the Border-land, bearded to its rock-ridged forehead\r\nwith such bush-bristles and haired with matted heather.  In nature\r\nit is what a painted Indian squaw in her blanket, eagle feathers and\r\nmoccasins, is in the world of humanity.  We look upon both with a\r\nspecies of admiration, as contrasts with objects whose worth is\r\nmeasured by the comparison.  The Empress Eugenie and the Princess of\r\nWales, and wives and sisters lovelier still to the circles of humble\r\nlife, look more beautiful and graceful when the eye turns to them\r\nfrom a glance at the best-looking squaw of the North American wilds.\r\nAnd so looked the well-dressed hills on each side of the Teviot,\r\ncompared with the uncultured and stunted mountains among which I had\r\nso recently walked.\r\n\r\nAscending from Teviotdale, I passed the Earl of Minto's seat, a\r\nlarge and modern-looking mansion, surrounded with beautiful grounds\r\nand noble trees, and commanding a grand and picturesque view of\r\nvalley and mountain from an excellent point of observation.  As soon\r\nas I lost sight of Teviotdale another grand vista of golden and\r\npurpled hills and rich valleys burst upon my sight as suddenly as\r\ntheatrical sceneries are shifted on the stage.  Dined in a little,\r\nrural, unpoetical village bearing the name of Lilliesleaf.  Resuming\r\nmy walk, I soon came in sight of the grand valley of the Tweed, a\r\ngreat basin of natural beauty, holding, as it were, Scotland's\r\n\"apples of gold in pictures of silver.\"  Every step commanded some\r\nnew feature of interest.  Here on the left arose to the still, blue\r\nbosom of the sky the three great Eildon Hills, with their heads\r\ncrowned with heather as with an emerald diadem.  The sun is low, and\r\nthe far-off village in the valley shows dimly between the daylight\r\nand darkness.  There is the shadow of a broken edifice, broken but\r\ngrand, that arises out of the midst of the low houses.  A little\r\nfarther on, arches, and the stone vein-work of glassless windows,\r\nand ivy-netted towers come out more distinctly.  I recognise them at\r\nthe next furlong.  They stand thus in pictures hung up in the\r\nparlors of thousands of common homes in America, Australia and\r\nIndia.  They are the ruins of Melrose Abbey.  Here is the original\r\nof the picture.  I see it at last, as thousands of Americans have\r\nseen it before.  In history and association it is to them the\r\nWestminster Abbey of Scotland, but in ruin.  It looks natural,\r\nthough not at first glance what one expected.  The familiar\r\nengraving does not give us the real flesh and blood of the\r\nantiquity, or the complexion of the stone; but it does not\r\nexaggerate the exquisite symmetries and artistic genius of the\r\nstructure.  These truly inspire one with wonder.  They are all that\r\npen and pencil have described them.  The great window, which is the\r\nmost salient feature in the common picture, is a magnificent piece\r\nof work in stone, twenty-four feet in height and sixteen in breadth.\r\nIt is all in the elm-tree order of architecture.  The old monks\r\nbelonged to that school, and they wrought out branches, leaves and\r\nleaf-veins, and framed the lacework of their chisels with colored\r\nglass most exquisitely.\r\n\r\nMelrose Abbey was the eldest daughter, I believe, of Rievaulx Abbey,\r\nin Yorkshire, which has already been noticed; a year or two older in\r\nits foundation than Fountain Abbey, in Studley Park.  The fecundity\r\nwith which these ecclesiastical buildings multiplied and replenished\r\nEngland and Scotland is a marvel, considering the age in which they\r\nwere erected and the small population and the poverty of the\r\ncountry.  But something on this aspect of the subject hereafter.\r\nHere lie the ashes of Scottish kings, abbots and knights whose names\r\nfigured conspicuously in the history of public and private wars\r\nwhich cover such a space of the country's life as an independent\r\nnation.  The Douglas family especially with several of its branches\r\nfound a resting-place for their dust within these walls.  Built and\r\nrebuilt, burnt and reburnt, mutilated, dismembered, consecrated and\r\ndesecrated, make up the history of this celebrated edifice, and that\r\nof its like, from Land's End to John O'Groat's.  It is a slight but\r\na very appreciable mitigation of these destructive acts that it was\r\nruined _artistically_; just as some enthusiastic castle and abbey-\r\npainter would have suggested.\r\n\r\nAlthough I spent the night at Melrose, it was a dark and cloudy one,\r\nso that I could not see the abbey by moonlight--a view so much\r\nprized and celebrated.  The next day I literally walked from morning\r\ntill evening among the tombstones of antiquity and monuments of\r\nScotch history invested with an interest which will never wane.  In\r\nthe first place, I went down the Tweed a few miles and crossed it in\r\na ferry-boat to see Dryburgh Abbey.  Here, embowered among the trees\r\nin a silver curve of the river, stands this grand monument of one of\r\nthe most remarkable ages of the world.  Within an hour's walk from\r\nMelrose, and four or five years only after the completion of that\r\nedifice, the foundations of this were laid.  It is astonishing.  We\r\nwill not dwell upon it now, but make a separate chapter on it when I\r\nhave seen most of the other ruins of the kind in the kingdom.  The\r\nFrench are given to the habit of festooning the monuments and graves\r\nof their relatives and friends with immortelles.  Nature has hung\r\none of hers to Dryburgh Abbey.  It is a yew-tree opposite the door\r\nby which you enter the ruins.  The year-rings of its trunk register\r\nall the centuries that the stones of the oldest wall have stood\r\nimbedded one upon the other.  The tree is still green, putting forth\r\nits leaf in its season.  But there is an immortelle hung to these\r\ndark, crumbling walls that shall outlive the greenest trees now\r\ngrowing on earth.  Here, in a little vaulted chapel, or rather a\r\ndeep niche in the wall, lie the remains of Sir Walter Scott, his\r\nwife and the brilliant Lockhart.  How many thousands of all lands\r\nwhere the English language is spoken will come and stand here in\r\nmute and pensive communion before the iron gate of this family tomb\r\nand look through the bars upon this group of simply-lettered stones!\r\n\r\nFrom Dryburgh I walked back to Melrose on the east side of the\r\nTweed.  Lost the footpath, and for two hours clambered up and down\r\nthe precipitous cliffs that rise high and abrupt from the river.  In\r\nmany places the zig-zag path was cut into the rock, hardly a foot in\r\nbreadth, overhanging a precipice which a person of weak nerves could\r\nhardly face with composure.  At last got out of these dark\r\nfastnesses and ascended a range of lofty hills where I found a good\r\ncarriage road.  This elevation commanded the most magnificent view\r\nthat I ever saw in Scotland, excepting, perhaps, the one from\r\nStirling Castle only for the feature which the Forth supplies.  It\r\nwas truly beautiful beyond description, and it would be useless for\r\nme to attempt one.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner in Melrose, I resumed my walk northward and came\r\nsuddenly upon Abbotsford.  Indeed, I should have missed it, had I\r\nnot noticed a wooden gate open on the roadside, with some directions\r\nupon it for those wishing to visit the house.  As it stands low down\r\ntowards the river, and as all the space above it to the road is\r\ncovered with trees and shrubbery, it is entirely hidden from view in\r\nthat direction.  The descent to the house is rather steep and long.\r\nAnd here it is!--Abbotsford!  It is the photograph of Sir Walter\r\nScott.  It is brim full of him and his histories.  No author's pen\r\never gave such an individuality to a human home.  It is all the\r\ncoinage of thoughts that have flooded the hemispheres.  Pages of\r\nliving literature built up all these lofty walls, bent these arches,\r\npanelled these ceilings, and filled the whole edifice with these\r\nmementoes of the men and ages gone.  Every one of these hewn stones\r\ncost a paragraph; that carved and gilded crest, a column's length of\r\nthinking done on paper.  It must be true that pure, unaided literary\r\nlabor never built before a mansion of this magnitude and filled it\r\nwith such treasures of art and history.  This will forever make it\r\nand the pictures of it a monument of peculiar interest.  I have said\r\nthat it is brim full of the author.  It is equally full of all he\r\nwrote about; full of the interesting topographs of Scotland's\r\nhistory, back to the twilight ages; full inside and out, and in the\r\nvery garden and stable walls.  The studio of an artist was never\r\nfuller of models of human or animal heads, or of counterfeit\r\nduplicates of Nature's handiwork, than Sir Walter's mansion is of\r\nthings his pen painted on in the long life of its inspirations.  The\r\nvery porchway that leads into the house is hung with petrified stag-\r\nhorns, doubtless dug up in Scottish bogs, and illustrating a page of\r\nthe natural history of the country in some pre-historic century.\r\nThe halls are panelled with Scotland,--with carvings in oak from the\r\nold palace of Dunfermline.  Coats of arms of the celebrated Border\r\nchieftains are arrayed in line around the walls.  The armoury is a\r\nminiature arsenal of all arms ever wielded since the time of the\r\nDruids.  And a history attaches to nearly every one of the weapons.\r\nHistory hangs its webwork everywhere.  It is built, high and low,\r\ninto the face of the outside walls.  Quaint, old, carved stones from\r\nabbey and castle ruins, arms, devices and inscriptions are all here\r\npresented to the eye like the printed page of an open volume.  Among\r\nthe interesting relics are a chair made from the rafters of the\r\nhouse in which Wallace was betrayed, Rob Roy's pistol, and the key\r\nof the old Tolbooth of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nI was conducted through the rooms opened to visitors by a very\r\ngentlemanly-looking man, who might be taken for an author himself,\r\nfrom his intellectual appearance and conversation.  The library is\r\nthe largest of all the apartments--fifty feet by sixty.  Nor is it\r\ntoo large for the collection of books it contains, which numbers\r\nabout 20,000 volumes, many of them very rare and valuable.  But the\r\nsoul-centre of the building to me was the _study_, opening into the\r\nlibrary.  There is the small writing-table, and there is the plain\r\narmchair in which he sat by it and worked out those creations of\r\nfancy which have excited such interest through the world.  That\r\nsquare foot over against this chair, where his paper lay, is the\r\nfocus, the point of incidence and reflection, of thoughts that\r\npencilled outward, like sun-rays, until their illumination reached\r\nthe antipodes,--thoughts that brought a pleasant shining to the sun-\r\nburnt face of the Australian shepherd as he watched his flock at\r\nnoon from under the shadow of a stunted tree; thoughts which made a\r\ncheery fellowship at night for the Hudson Bay hunter, in his snow-\r\nburied cabin on the Saskatchiwine.  The books of this little inner\r\nlibrary were the body-guard of his genius, chosen to be nearest him\r\nin the outsallyings of his imagination.  Here is a little\r\nconversational closet, with a window in it to let in the leaf-sifted\r\nlight and air--a small recess large enough for a couple of chairs or\r\nso, which he called a \"Speak-a-bit.\"  Here is something so near his\r\npersonality that it almost startles you like a sudden apparition of\r\nhimself.  It is a glass case containing the clothes he last wore on\r\nearth,--the large-buttoned, blue coat, the plaid trousers, the\r\nbroad-brimmed hat, and heavy, thick-soled shoes which he had on when\r\nhe came in from his last walk to lay himself down and die.\r\n\r\nOn signing my name in the register, I was affected at a coincidence\r\nwhich conveyed a tribute of respect to the memory of the great\r\nauthor of striking significance, while it recorded the painful\r\ncatastrophe which has broken over upon the American Republic.  It\r\nwas a sad sight to me to see the profane and suicidal antagonisms\r\nwhich have rent it in twain brought to the shrine of this great\r\nmemory and graven upon its sacred tablet as it were with the\r\nmurdering dagger's point.  New and bad initials!  The father and\r\npatriot Washington would have wept tears of blood to have read them\r\nhere,--to have read them anywhere, bearing such deplorable meaning.\r\nThey were U.S.A. and C.S.A., as it were chasing each other up and\r\ndown the pages of the visitors' register.  Sad, sad was the sight--\r\nsadder, in a certain sense, than the smoke-wreaths of the Tuscarora\r\nand Alabama ploughing the broad ocean with their keels.  U.S.A. and\r\nC.S.A.!  What initials for Americans to write, with the precious\r\nmemories of a common history and a common weal still held to their\r\nhearts--to write here or anywhere!  What a riving and a ruin do\r\nthose letters record!  Still they brought in their severed hands a\r\ncommon homage-gift to the memory of the Writer of Abbotsford.  If\r\nthey represented the dissolution of a great political fabric, in\r\nwhich they once gloried with equal pride, they meant union here--a\r\noneness indissoluble in admiration for a great genius whose memory\r\ncan no more be localised to a nation than the interest of his works.\r\n\r\nAmerican names, both of the North and South, may be found on almost\r\nevery page of the register.  I wrote mine next to that of a\r\ngentleman from Worcester, Mass., my old place of residence, who only\r\nleft an hour before my arrival.  Abbotsford and Stratford-upon-Avon\r\nare points to which our countrymen converge in their travels in this\r\ncountry; and you will find more of their signatures in the registry\r\nof these two haloed homesteads of genius than anywhere else in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Tweed in this section is all an artist would\r\ndelight in as a surrounding of such histories.  The hills are lofty,\r\ndeclining into gorges or dells at different angles with the river,\r\nwhich they wall in precipitously with their wooded sides in many\r\nplaces.  They are mostly cultivated to the top, and now in harvest\r\nmany of them were crowned with stooked sheaves of wheat, each\r\nlooking in the distance like Nature with her golden curls done up in\r\npaper, dressing for the harvest-home of the season.  Some of them\r\nwore belts and gores of turnip foliage of different nuances of green\r\nluxuriance, combining with every conceivable shade and alternation\r\nof vegetable coloring.  Indeed, as already intimated, the view from\r\nthe eminence almost overhanging the little sequestered peninsula on\r\nwhich Old Melrose stood twelve centuries ago, is indescribably\r\nbeautiful, and well worth a long journey to see, disconnected from\r\nits historical associations.  The Eildon Hills towering up heather-\r\ncrowned to the height of over 1,300 feet above the level of the sea\r\nright out of the sheen of barley fields, as from a sea of silver,\r\nform one of the salient features of this glorious landscape.  This\r\nis an interesting peculiarity of Scotch scenery;--civilization\r\nsapping the barbarism of the wilderness; wheat-fields mordant biting\r\nin upon peaty moorlands, or climbing to the tops of cold, bald\r\nmountains, shearing off their thorny locks of heather and covering\r\nthem with the well-dressed chevelure of yellow grain.  Where the\r\nfarmer's horse cannot climb with the plough, or the little sheep\r\ncannot graze to advantage, human hands plant the Scotch larch or\r\nfir, just as a tenant-gardener would set out cabbage-plants in odd\r\ncorners of his little holding which he could have no other use for.\r\n\r\nAbbotsferry is just above Abbotsford, and is crossed in a small row-\r\nboat.  The river here is of considerable width and quite rapid.  The\r\nboat was kept on the other side; so I hallooed to a man engaged in\r\nthatching a rick of oats to come and ferry me over.  Without\r\ndescending from the ladder, he called to some one in the cottage,\r\nwhen, to my surprise, a well-dressed young woman, in rather flowing\r\ndress, red jacket, and with her hair tastefully done up in a net a-\r\nla-mode, made her appearance.  Descending to the river, she folded\r\nup her gown, and, settling herself to the oars, \"pushed her light\r\nshallop from the shore\" with the grace of The Lady of the Lake.  In\r\na few minutes she ran the prow upon the pebbled beach at my feet,\r\nand I took my seat at the other end of the boat.  She did it all so\r\nnaturally, and without any other flush upon her pleasant face than\r\nthat of the exercise of rowing, that I felt quite easy myself and\r\nchecked the expression of regret I was on the point of uttering for\r\nputting her to such service.  A few questions convinced me it was\r\nher regular employment, especially when her father was busy.  I\r\ncould not help asking her if she had ever read \"The Lady of the\r\nLake,\" but found that neither that romance nor any other had ever\r\ninvested her river experience with any sensibility except of a\r\ncheerful duty.  She was going to do the whole for a penny, her usual\r\ncharge, but I declined to take back any change for the piece of\r\nsilver I gave to her, intimating that I regarded it cheap at that to\r\nbe rowed over a river by such hands.\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite to Abbotsford I passed one of the best farming\r\nestablishments I had seen in Scotland.  I was particularly struck\r\nwith a feature which will hereafter distinguish the steddings or\r\nfarm buildings in Great Britain.  Steam has already accomplished\r\nmany changes, and among others one that could hardly have been\r\nanticipated when it was first applied to common uses.  It has\r\nvirtually turned the threshing-floor out of doors.  Grain growing\r\nhas become completely out-of-door work, from seeding to sending to\r\nmarket.  The day of building two-story barns for storing and\r\nthreshing wheat, barley and oats is over, I am persuaded, in this\r\ncountry.  A quadrangle of slate-roofed cow-sheds, for housing horses\r\nand cattle, will displace the old-fashioned barns, each with its\r\nrood of roof.  This I saw on crossing the Tweed was quite new, and\r\nmay serve as a model of the housing that will come into vogue\r\nrapidly.  One familiar with New England in the \"old meeting-house\"\r\ntime would call this establishment a hollow square of horse-sheds,\r\nwithout a break or crevice at the angles.\r\n\r\nI reached Galashiels about 5 p.m., and stopped an hour for tea.\r\nThis is a vigorous and thrifty town, that makes a profitable and\r\nuseful business of the manufacture of tweeds, tartans and shawls.\r\nIt is situated on the banks of the Gala, a little, rapid, shallow\r\nriver that joins the Tweed about a mile below.  After tea I resumed\r\nmy walk, but owing to the confused direction of the landlady, took\r\nthe wrong side of the river, and diverged westward toward Peebles.\r\nI had made three miles or more in this direction before I found out\r\nmy mistake, so was obliged to return to Galashiels, where I\r\nconcluded to spend the night, after another involuntary excursion\r\nmore unsatisfactory than my walk around Sheffield, inasmuch as I had\r\nto travel over the same road twice for the whole distance.  Thus the\r\nthree mistakes thus far made have cost me twenty miles of extra\r\nfooting.  The next morning I set out in good season, determined to\r\nreach Edinburgh, if possible, by night.\r\n\r\nFollowed the Gala Water, as it is called here, just as if it were a\r\nplacid lake or land-locked bay, though it is a tortuous and swift-\r\nrunning stream.  The scenery was still picturesque, in some places\r\nvery grand and romantic.  There was one great amphitheatre just\r\nbefore reaching the village of Stow which was peculiarly\r\ninteresting.  It was a great bowl full of earth's glory up to the\r\nvery rim.  The circular wall was embossed with the best patterns and\r\ncolors of vegetation.  The hills of every tournure showed each in a\r\nfir setting, looking, with their sloping fields of grain, like\r\ninverted goblets of gold vined with emerald leafwork.  In the valley\r\na reaping machine was at work with its peculiar chatter and clatter,\r\nand men and women were following in its wake, gathering up and\r\nbinding the grain as it fell and clearing the way for the next\r\nround.  Up and down these hills frequently runs a stripe of Scotch\r\nfirs or larches a few rods wide; here and there they resemble those\r\ngeometrical figures often seen in gardens and pleasure grounds.  The\r\nsun peeping out of the clouds, and flooding these features with a\r\nsudden, transient river of light, gives them a glow and glory that\r\nwould delight the artist.  After a long walk through such scenery, I\r\nreached, late in the evening, Auld Reekie, a favorite home-name\r\nwhich the modern Athenians love to give to Edinburgh.  Being anxious\r\nto push on and complete my journey as soon as practicable, I only\r\nremained in the celebrated Scotch metropolis one night, taking staff\r\nearly next morning, and holding northward towards the Highlands.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh has made its mark upon the world and its place among the\r\ngreat centres of the world's civilization.  On the whole, no city in\r\nGreat Britain, or in Christendom, has ever attained to such well-\r\ndeveloped, I will not say angular, but salient individuality.  This\r\nis deep-featured and ineffaceable.  It is, not was.  Edinburgh has\r\nreared great men prolifically and supplied the world with them, and\r\nkept always a good number back for itself to give a shaping to\r\nothers the world needed.  Its prestige is great in the production of\r\nsuch intellects.  But it keeps up with the times.  It is faithful to\r\nits antecedents, and appreciates them at their full value and\r\nobligation.  It does not lie a-bed until noon because it has got its\r\nname up for educating brilliant minds.  Its grand old University\r\nholds its own among the wranglers of learning.  Its High School is\r\nproportionately as high as ever, notwithstanding the rapid growth of\r\nothers of the same purpose.  Its pulpit boasts of its old mind-power\r\nand moral stature.  Its Theology stands iron-cabled, grand and solid\r\nas an iceberg in the sea of modern speculation, unsoftened under the\r\npatter of the heterodox sentimentalities of human philanthropy.  It\r\nis growing more and more a City of Palaces.  And the palaces are all\r\nbuilt for housing the poorest of the poor, the weakest of the weak\r\nand the vilest of the vile.  These hospitals are the Holyroods of\r\nEdinburgh II.  They honor it with a renown better than the royal\r\npalace of the latter name ever won.\r\n\r\nI said Edinburgh the Second.  That is correct.  There are two towns,\r\nthe Old and the New; the last about half a century's age.  But the\r\noldest will be the youngest fifty years hence.  The hand of a\r\n\"higher civilization,\" with its spirit-level, pick, plane and\r\ntrowel, is upon it with the grip of a Samson.  That hand will tone\r\ndown its great distinctive individualities and give it the modern\r\n_uniformity_ of design, face and feature.  All these tall houses,\r\nbuilt skyward layer upon layer or flat upon flat, until they show\r\nhalf a dozen stories on one street, and twice that number on the\r\nother, are doomed, and they will be done for, one by one in its\r\nturn.  They probably came in with Queen Mary, and they will go out\r\nunder the blue-eyed Alexandra.  They will be supplanted by the most\r\nimproved architecture of modern taste and utilitarianism.  Edinburgh\r\nwill be Anglicised and put in the fashionable costume of a\r\nprogressive age; in the same swallow-tailed coat, figured vest and\r\nstovepipe hat worn by London, Liverpool and Manchester.  It will not\r\nbe allowed to wear tweed pantaloons except for one circumstance;--\r\nthat it is now building its best houses of stone instead of brick.\r\n\r\nBut there are physical features that will always distinguish\r\nEdinburgh from all other cities of the world and which no\r\narchitectural changes can ever obliterate or deface.  There are\r\nArthur's Seat, Salisbury Crags, the Calton Hill, and the Castle\r\nHeight, and there they will stand forever--the grandest surroundings\r\nand garniture of Nature ever given to any capital or centre of the\r\nearth's populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCH LEVEN-ITS ISLANDCASTLE--STRATHS--PERTH--SALMON-BREEDING--\r\nTHOUGHTS ON FISH-FARMING--DUNKELD--BLAIR ATHOLL--DUCAL TREE-PLANTER-\r\n-STRATHSPEY AND ITS SCENERY--THE ROADS--SCOTCH CATTLE AND SHEEP--\r\nNIGHT IN A WAYSIDE COTTAGE--ARRIVAL AT INVERNESS.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, Sept. 11th, I left for the north the morning after my\r\narrival in Edinburgh, hoping to finish my long walk before the rainy\r\nseason commenced.  My old friend and host accompanied me across the\r\nForth, by the Granton Ferry, and walked with me for some distance on\r\nthe other side; then bidding me God-speed, he returned to the city.\r\nThe weather was fine, and the farmers were very busy at work.  A\r\nvast quantity of grain, especially of oats, was cut and ready for\r\ncarting; but little of it had been ricked in consequence of frequent\r\nshowers.  I noticed that they used a different snath for their\r\nscythes here from that common in England.  It is in two parts, like\r\nthe handles of a plough, joining a foot or two above the blade.  One\r\nis shorter than the other, each having a thole.  It is a singular\r\ncontrivance, but seems to be preferred here to the old English pole.\r\nI have never seen yet an American scythe-snath in England or\r\nScotland, although so much of our implemental machinery has been\r\nintroduced.  American manure-forks and hay-forks, axes and augurs\r\nyou will now find exposed for sale in nearly every considerable\r\ntown, but one of our beautifully mounted scythes would be a great\r\nnovelty here.\r\n\r\nThe scenery varies, but retains the peculiarly Scotch features.\r\nHills which we should call mountains are frequently planted with\r\ntrees as far up as the soil will lie upon the precipitous sides.  On\r\npassing one of great height, bald at the top, but bearded to the\r\neyebrows with fir and larch, I asked an elderly man, a blacksmith,\r\nstanding in his shop-door, if they were a natural growth.  He said\r\nthat he and his two boys planted them all about forty-eight years\r\nago.  They were now worth, on an average, twelve English shillings,\r\nor about three dollars a-piece.\r\n\r\nI lodged in Kinross, a pleasant-faced, quiet and comfortable little\r\ntown, done up with historical associations of special interest.\r\nHere is Loch Leven, serene and placid, like a mirror framed with\r\nwooded hills, looking at their faces in it.  It is a beautiful sheet\r\nof water, taking the history out of it.  But putting that in and\r\naround it, you see a picture before you that you will remember.\r\nHere is more of Mary the Unfortunate.  You see reflected in the\r\nsilver sheen of the lake that face which looks at you with its soft\r\nappeal for sympathy in all the galleries of Christendom.  Out there,\r\non that little islet, green and low, stands the black castle in\r\nwhich they prisoned her.  There they made her trembling, indignant\r\nfingers write herself \"a queen without a crown.\"  Southward there,\r\nwhere amateurs now fish for trout, young Douglas rowed her ashore\r\nwith muffled oars so softly that they stirred no ripple at the bow.\r\nThe keys of the castle they threw into the lake to bar pursuit, lay\r\nin the mud for nearly three centuries, when they were found by a lad\r\nof the village, and presented to the Earl of Morton, a\r\nrepresentative of the Douglas family.\r\n\r\nThe next day I walked on to Perth, passing through a very\r\ninteresting section, which nature and history have enriched with\r\nlandscapes and manscapes manifold.  It is truly a romantic region\r\nfor both these qualities, with delightful views in sudden and\r\nfrequent alternation.  Glens deep, winding and dark, with steep\r\nmountain walls folding their tree-hands over the road; lofty hills\r\nin full Scotch uniform, in tartan heather and yellow grain plaided\r\nin various figures; chippering streams, now hidden, now coming to\r\nthe light, in white flashing foam in a rocky glade of the dell;\r\nstraths or savannas, like great prairie gardens, threaded by\r\nmeandering rivers and studded with wheat in sheaves, shocks and\r\nricks, seen over long reaches of unreapt harvests; villages,\r\nhamlets, white cottages nestling in the niches and green gorges of\r\nthe mountains,--and all these sceneries set in romantic histories\r\ndating back to the Danes and their doings in Scotland, make up a\r\nprevista for the eye and a revista for the mind that keep both in\r\nexhilarating occupation every rod of the distance from Kinross to\r\nPerth.\r\n\r\nThe road via Glenfarg would be a luxury of the first enjoyment to\r\nany tourist with an eye to the wild, romantic and picturesque.\r\nDebouching from this long, winding, tree-arched dell, you come out\r\nupon Strathearn, or the bottom-land of the river Earn, which joins\r\nthe Tay a few miles below.  The term strath is peculiarly a Scottish\r\ndesignation which many American readers may not have fully\r\ncomprehended, although it is so blended with the history and romance\r\nof this country.  It is not a valley proper, as we use that term; as\r\nthe Valley of the Mississippi or the Valley of the Connecticut.  If\r\nthe word were admissible, it might be called most descriptively the\r\nland-bay of a river, at a certain distance between its source and\r\nmouth, such for instance as the German Flats on the Mohawk, or the\r\nOxbow on the Connecticut, at Wethersfield, in Vermont, or the great\r\nonion-growing flat on the same river at Wethersfield in Connecticut.\r\nThese straths are numerous in Scotland, and constitute the great\r\nproductive centres of the mountain sections.  They are generally\r\ncultivated to the highest perfection of agricultural science and\r\neconomy and are devoted mostly to grain.  As they are always walled\r\nin by bald-headed mountains and lofty hills, cropped as high as man\r\nand horse can climb with a plough and planted with firs and larches\r\nbeyond, they show beautifully to the eye, and constitute, with these\r\nsurroundings, the peculiar charm of Scotch scenery.  The term is\r\nalways prefixed to the name of the river, as Strathearn, Strathspey,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI noticed on this day's walk the same singular habit that struck me\r\nin the north part of Yorkshire; that is, of cutting inward upon the\r\nstanding grain.  Several persons, frequently women and boys, follow\r\nthe mowers, and pick up the swath and bind it into sheaves, using no\r\nrake at all in the process.  So pertinaciously they seem to adhere\r\nto this remarkable and awkward custom, that I saw two mowers walk\r\ndown a hill, a distance of full a hundred rods, with their scythes\r\nunder their arms, in order to begin a new swath in the same way;\r\nfour or five men and women running after them full tilt to bind the\r\ngrain as it fell!  Here was a loss of at least five minutes each to\r\nhalf a dozen hands, amounting to half an hour to a single man at the\r\nend of each swath or work.  Supposing the mowers made twenty in ten\r\nhours from bottom to top of the field, here is the loss of one whole\r\nday for one man, or one sixth of the whole aggregate time applied to\r\nthe harvesting of the crop, given to the mere running down that hill\r\nof six pairs of legs for no earthly purpose but to cut inward\r\ninstead of outward, as we do.  The grain-ricks in Scotland are\r\nnearly all round and quite small.  Every one of them is rounded up\r\nat the top and fitted with a Mandarin-looking hat of straw, which\r\nsheds the rain well.  A good-sized farm-house is flanked with quite\r\na village of these little round stacks, looking like a comfortable\r\ncolony of large, yellow tea-caddies in the distance.\r\n\r\nReached Perth a little after dark, having made a walk of nearly\r\ntwenty miles after 11 a.m.  Here I remained over the Sabbath, and\r\ngreatly enjoyed both its rest and the devotional exercises in some\r\nof the churches of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Fair City of Perth is truly most beautifully situated at the\r\nhead of navigation on the Tay, as Stirling is on the Forth.  It has\r\nno mountainous eminence in its midst, castle-crowned, like Stirling,\r\nfrom which to look off upon such a scene as the latter commands.\r\nBut Nature has erected grand and lofty observatories near by in the\r\nMoncrieffe and Kinnoull Hills, from which a splendid prospect is\r\nunrolled to the eye.  There is some historical or legendary\r\nauthority for the idea that the Romans contemplated this view from\r\nMoncrieffe Hill; and, as the German army, returning homeward from\r\nFrance, shouted with wild enthusiasm, at its first sight, Der Rhein!\r\nDer Rhein! so these soldiers of the Caesars shouted at the view of\r\nthe Tay and the Corse of Gowrie, Ecce Tiber!  Ecce Compus Martius!\r\nThere was more patriotism than parity in the comparison.  The\r\nItalian river is a Rhine in history, but a mere Goose Creek within\r\nits actual banks compared with the Tay.  In history, Perth has its\r\nfull share of \"love and murder,\" rhyme and romance, sieges,\r\nbattering and burning, royals and rebels.  In the practical life of\r\nto-day, it is a progressive, thriving town, busy, intelligent,\r\nrespected and honorable.  The two natural features which would\r\nattract, perhaps, the most special attention of the traveller are\r\nthe two Inches, North and South, divided by the city.  This is a\r\npeculiar Scotch term which an untravelled American will hardly\r\nunderstand.  It has no relation to measurement of any kind; but\r\nsignifies what we should call a low, level green or common in or\r\nadjoining a town.  The Inches of Perth are, to my eye, the finest in\r\nScotland, each having about a mile and a half in circumference, and\r\nmaking delightful and healthy playgrounds and promenades for the\r\nwhole population.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Sept. 14th, I took staff and set out for another week-\r\nstage of my walk, or from Perth to Inverness.  Crossed the Tay and\r\nproceeded northward up the east side of that fertile river.  Fertile\r\nmay sound at first a singular qualification for a broad, rapid\r\nstream running down out of the mountains and widening into a bay or\r\nfirth at its mouth.  But it may be applied in the best sense of\r\nproduction to the Tay; and not only that, but other terms known to\r\npractical agriculture.  Up to the present moment, no river in the\r\nworld has been cultivated with more science and success.  None has\r\nbeen sown so thickly with seed-vitalities or produced more valuable\r\ncrops of aquatic life.  Here salmon are hatched by hand and folded\r\nand herded with a shepherd's care.  Here pisciculture, or, to use a\r\nfar better and more euphonious word, fish-farming, is carried to the\r\nhighest perfection in Great Britain.  It is a tillage that must\r\nhereafter take its place with agriculture as a great and honored\r\nindustry.  If the cold, bald-headed mountains, the wild, stony\r\nreaches of poverty-stricken regions, moor, morass, steppe and\r\nprairie are made the pasturage of sheep innumerable, the thousands\r\nof rivers in both hemispheres will not be suffered to run to waste\r\nthrough another century.  The utilitarian genius of the present age\r\nwill turn them into pasturage worth more per acre than the value of\r\nthe richest land on their banks.  Just think of the pasturage of the\r\nTay.  It rents for 14,000 pounds a year; and those who hire it must\r\nmake it produce at least 50,000 pounds, or $240,000 annually.  Let\r\nus assume that the whole length of this salmon-pasturage is fifty\r\nmiles, and its average width one-eighth of a mile.  Then the whole\r\ndistance would contain the space of 4,000 square acres, and the\r\nannual rent for fishing would amount to over 3 pounds 13s. per acre.\r\nThis would make every fish-bearing acre of the river worth 100\r\npounds, calculated on the land basis of interest or rent.\r\n\r\nHaving heard of the Stormontfields' Ponds for breeding salmon, I had\r\na great desire to see them.  They are situated on the Tay, a few\r\nmiles above Perth, and are well worthy of the inspection and\r\nadmiration of the scientific as well as the utilitarian world.  The\r\nprocess is as simple as it is successful and valuable.  A race or\r\ncanal, filled with a clear, mountain stream, and constructed many\r\nyears ago to supply motive power to a corn-mill, runs parallel with\r\nthe river, at the distance from it of about twenty rods.  At right\r\nangles with this stream, there are twenty-five wooden boxes side by\r\nside, about fifty feet in length, placed on a slight decline.  These\r\nboxes or troughs, each about two feet wide and one foot deep, are\r\ndivided into partitions by cross-boards, which do not reach, within\r\na few inches, the top of the siding, so that the water shall make a\r\ncontinuous surface the whole length of the trough.  Each trough is\r\nfilled with round river stones or pebbles washed clean, on which the\r\nspawn is laid.  The water is let out of the mill-race upon these\r\ntroughs through a wire-cloth filter, covering them about two inches\r\ndeep above the stones.  At the bottom, a lateral channel or race,\r\nrunning at right angles to the troughs, conducts the waste water in\r\na rapid, bubbling stream down into the feeding-pond, which covers\r\nthe space of about one-fifth of an acre, close to the river, with\r\nwhich it is connected by a narrow race gated also with a wire-cloth,\r\nto prevent the little living mites from being carried off before\r\ntheir time.\r\n\r\nThis may serve to give the reader some approximate idea of the\r\nconstruction of the fish-fold.  The next process is the stocking it\r\nwith the breeding ewes of the sea and river.  The female salmon is\r\ncaught in the spawning season with a net, and the ova are expressed\r\nfrom her by passing the hand gently down the body, when she is again\r\nput into the river to go on her way.  The manager told me that they\r\ngenerally reckoned upon a thousand eggs to a pound of the salmon\r\ncaught.  Thus fourteen good-sized fish would stock the twenty-five\r\ntroughs.  When hatched, the little things run down into the race-\r\nway, which carries them into the feeding-pond.  Here they are fed\r\ntwice daily, with five pounds of beef's liver pulverised.  They\r\nremain in this water-yard from April to autumn, when the gate is\r\nraised and they are let out into the river.  And it is a very\r\nsingular and interesting fact that those only go which have got\r\ntheir sea-coats on them, or have reached the \"smolt\" character.  The\r\nsmaller fry remain in the pond until, as it has been said in higher\r\ncircles of society, their beards are grown, or, in their case, until\r\ntheir scales are grown, to fit them for the rough and tumble of\r\nsalt-water life.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the little bull-headed mites, after being turned into\r\nthe river-pasture, is wonderful--more rapid than that of lambs of\r\nthe Southdown breed.  The keeper had marked some of them, on letting\r\nthem out, by clipping the dorsal fin.  On being caught six or eight\r\nmonths afterward, they weighed from five to seven pounds against\r\nhalf a pound each when sent forth to take care of themselves.  The\r\nproprietors of the fisheries defray the expense of this breeding\r\nestablishment, being taxed only twopence in the pound of their\r\nrental.  This, of course, they get back with large interest and\r\nprofit from the tenant-farmers of the river.  As a proof of the\r\nenhanced production of the Tay fisheries under this cultivation the\r\nfact will suffice, that they now rent for 14,000 pounds a year\r\nagainst 11,000 pounds under the old system.\r\n\r\nSalmon-breeding is doubtless destined to rank with sheep-culture and\r\ncattle-culture in the future.  The remotest colonies of Great\r\nBritain are moving in the matter with vigor and almost enthusiasm.\r\nVessels have been constructed on purpose to convey this fair and\r\nmottled stock of British rivers to those of Australia and New\r\nZealand.  In France, fish-farming has become a large and lucrative\r\noccupation.  I hope our own countrymen, who plume themselves on\r\ngoing ahead in utilitarian enterprises, will show the world what\r\nthey can do in this.  Surely our New England men, who claim to lead\r\nin American industries and ingenuities, will not suffer half a\r\nmillion acres of river-pasturage to run to waste for another half\r\ncentury, when it would fold and feed millions of salmon.  Once they\r\nherded in the Connecticut in such multitudes that a special\r\nstipulation was inserted in the indentures of apprentices in the\r\nvicinity of the river, that they should not be obliged to eat salmon\r\nmore than a certain number of times in a week.  Now, if a salmon is\r\ncaught between the mouth and source of the river, it is blazoned\r\nforth in the newspapers as a very extraordinary and unnatural event.\r\nThere is no earthly reason why the Connecticut should not breed and\r\nsupply as great a number of these excellent and beautiful fish as\r\nthe Tay.  Its waters are equally pure and quiet as those of the\r\nScotch river.  Every acre of the Connecticut, from the northernmost\r\nbridge that spans it in Vermont to its debouchment at Saybrook,\r\nmight be made productive of as great a value as any onion-garden\r\nacre at Wethersfield.\r\n\r\nThe salmon-shepherd at Stormontfields, having fully explained the\r\nlabors and duties of his charge, rowed me across the Tay, and I\r\ncontinued my walk highly gratified in having seen one of the new\r\nindustries which this age is adding to the different cultures\r\nprovided for the sustentation and comfort of human life.  The whole\r\nway to Dunkeld was full of interest, nature and history making every\r\nmile a scene to delight the eye and exhilarate the mind.  The first\r\nconsiderable village I passed through was Stanley, which gives the\r\nname to that old family of British peers known in history by the\r\nbattle-cry of a badly-pressed sovereign, \"On, Stanley, on!\"\r\nMurthley Castle, the seat of Sir William Stewart, and the beautiful\r\ngrounds which front and surround it, will excite the admiration of\r\nthe traveller and pay him well for a moment's pause to peruse its\r\nilluminated pages opened to his view.  The baronet is regarded as an\r\neccentric man, perhaps chiefly because he has built a splendid Roman\r\nCatholic chapel quite near to his mansion and supports a priest of\r\nthat order mostly for his own spiritual good.  Near Dunkeld, Birnam\r\nHill lifts its round, dark, bushy head to the height of over 1,500\r\nfeet, grand and grim, as if it wore the bonnet of Macbeth and hid\r\nhis dagger beneath its tartan cloak of firs.  \"Birnam Wood,\" which\r\nShakespeare's genius has made one of the immortals among earthly\r\nlocalities, was the setting of that hill in his day, and perhaps\r\ncenturies before it.  Crossing the Tay by a magnificent bridge, you\r\nare in the famous old city and capital of ancient Caledonia,\r\nDunkeld.  Here centre some of the richest rivulets of Scotch\r\nhistory, ecclesiastical and military, of church and state, cowl and\r\ncrown.  Walled in here, on the upper waters of the Tay, by dark and\r\nheavily-wooded mountains, it was just the place for the earliest\r\nmonks to select as the site of one of their cloistered communities.\r\nThe two best saints ever produced by these islands, St. Columba and\r\nSt. Cuthbert, are said to have been connected with the religious\r\nfoundations of this little sequestered city.  The old cathedral,\r\nhaving been knocked about like other Roman Catholic edifices in the\r\nsledge-hammer crusades of the Reformation, was _ruined_ very\r\npicturesquely, as a tourist, with one of Murray's red-book guides in\r\nhis hand, would be likely to say.  But the choir was rebuilt and\r\nfitted up for worship by the late Duke of Atholl at the expense of\r\nabout 5,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nOf this duke I must say a few words, for he has left the greenest\r\nmonument to his memory that a man ever planted over his grave.  He\r\ndid something more and better than roofing the choir of a ruined\r\ncathedral.  He roofed a hundred hills and valleys with a larch-and-\r\nfir work that will make them as glorious and beautiful as Lebanon\r\nforever.  One of the most illustrious and eloquent of the Iroquois\r\naristocracy was a chief called Corn-planter.  This Duke of Atholl\r\nshould be named and known for evermore as the great Tree-planter of\r\nChristendom.  We have already dwelt upon the benefaction that such a\r\nman leaves to coming generations.  This Scotch nobleman virtually\r\nfounded a new order of knighthood far more useful and honorable than\r\nthe Order of the Garter.  To talk of _garters_!--why, he not only\r\nput the cold, ragged shivering hills of Scotland into garters, but\r\ninto stockings waist high, and doublets and bonnets and shoes of\r\nbeautifully green and thick fir-plaid.  He planted 11,000 square\r\nacres with the larch alone; and thousands of these acres stood up\r\nedgewise against mountains and hills so steep that the planters must\r\nhave spaded the holes with ropes around their waists to keep them\r\nfrom falling down the precipice.  It is stated that he had twenty-\r\nseven millions of the larch alone planted on his mountainous\r\nestates, besides several millions of other trees.  Now, it is\r\ndoubtful if the whole region thus dibbled with this tree-crop\r\nyielded an average rental of one English shilling per acre as a\r\npasturage for sheep.  On passing through miles and miles of this\r\nmagnificent wood-grain and taking an estimate of its value, I put it\r\nat 10s., or $2 40c. per tree.  Of the twenty-seven millions of\r\nlarches thus planted, ten must be worth that sum; making alone,\r\nwithout counting the rest, 5,000,000 pounds, or $24,000,000.  It is\r\nquite probable that the larches, firs and other trees now covering\r\nthe Atholl estates, would sell for 10,000,000 pounds if brought to\r\nthe hammer.  But he was not only the greatest arboriculturist in the\r\nworld, but the founder of tree-farming as a productive industry as\r\nwell as a decorative art.  Already it has transformed the Highlands\r\nof Scotland and trebled their value, as well as clothed them with a\r\nnew and beautiful scenery.  What we call the Scotch larch was not\r\noriginally a native of that country.  Close to the cathedral in\r\nDunkeld stand the two patriarchs of the family, first introduced\r\ninto Scotland from Switzerland in 1737.\r\n\r\nHaving remained the best part of two days in Dunkeld, I held on\r\nnorthward, through heavily-shaded and winding glen and valley to\r\nBlair Atholl.  For the whole distance of twenty miles the country is\r\nquite Alpine, wild and grand, with mountains larched or firred to\r\nthe utmost reach and tenure of soil for roots; deep, dark gorges\r\npouring down into the narrowing river their foamy, dashing streams;\r\nmansions planted here and there on sloping lawns showing sunnily\r\nthrough groves and parks; now a hamlet of cottages set in the side\r\nof a lofty hill, now a larger village opening suddenly upon you at\r\nthe turning of the turnpike road.  I reached Blair Atholl at about\r\ndark, and lodged at the largest hotel I slept in between London and\r\nJohn O'Groat's.  It is virtually the tourist's inn; for this is the\r\ncentre of some of the most interesting and striking sceneries and\r\nlocalities in Scotland.  Glens, waterfalls, stream, torrent,\r\nmountain and valley, with their romantic histories, make this a very\r\nattractive region to thousands of summer travellers from England and\r\nother countries.  The railway from Perth to Inverness via Dunkeld\r\nand Blair Atholl, has just opened up this secluded Scotch\r\nSwitzerland to multitudes who never would have seen it without the\r\nhelp of the Iron Horse.  A month previous, this point had been the\r\nmost distant in Scotland from steam-routes of transportation and\r\ntravel.  Now southern sportsmen were hiring up \"the shooting\" for\r\nmany miles on both sides of the line, making the hills and glens\r\necho with their fusillades.  Blair Castle, the duke's mansion, is a\r\nvery ordinary building in appearance, looking from the public road\r\nlike a large four-story factory painted white, with small, old-\r\nfashioned windows.  He himself was lying in a very painful and\r\nprecarious condition, with a cancer in the throat, from which it was\r\nthe general impression that he never would recover.  The day\r\npreceding, the Queen had visited him, while en route for Balmoral,\r\nhaving gone sixty miles out of her way to comfort him with such an\r\nexpression of her sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe next day I reached the northern boundary of the Duke of Atholl's\r\nestates, having walked for full forty miles continuously through it.\r\nPassed over a very bleak, treeless, barren waste of mountain and\r\nmoorland, most of it too rocky or soilless for even heather.  The\r\ndashing, flashing, little Garry, which I had followed for a day or\r\ntwo, thinned and narrowed down to a noisy brook as I ascended\r\ntowards its source.  For a long distance the country was exceedingly\r\nwild and desolate.  Terrible must be the condition of a man\r\nbenighted therein, especially in winter.  There were standing\r\nbeacons all along the road for miles, to indicate the track when it\r\nwas buried in drifting snow.  These were painted posts, about six or\r\neight feet high, planted on the rocky, river side of the road, at a\r\nfew rods interval, to guide the traveller and keep him from dashing\r\nover the concealed precipices.  About the middle of the afternoon I\r\nreached the summit of the two watersheds, where a horse's hoof might\r\nso dam a balancing stream as to send it southward into the Tay or\r\nnorthward into the Moray Firth.  Soon a rivulet welled out in the\r\nlatter direction with a decided current.  It was the Spey.  A few\r\nmiles brought me suddenly into a little, glorious world of beauty.\r\nThe change of theatrical sceneries could hardly have produced a more\r\nsudden and striking contrast than this presented to the wild, cold,\r\ndark waste through which I had been travelling for a day.  It was\r\nStrathspey; and I doubt if there is another view in Scotland, of the\r\nsame dimensions, to equal it.  It was indescribably grand and\r\nbeautiful, if you could blend the meaning of these two commonly-\r\ncoupled adjectives into one qualification, as you can blend two\r\ncolors on the easel.  To get the full enjoyment of the scene at one\r\ndraught, you should enter it first from the south, after having\r\ntravelled for twenty miles without seeing a sheaf of wheat or patch\r\nof vegetation tilled by the hand of man.  I know nothing in America\r\nto compare it with or to help the American reader to an approximate\r\nidea of it.  Imagine a land-lake, apparently shut in completely by a\r\ncircular wall of mountains of every stature, the tallest looking\r\nover the shoulders of the lower hills, like grand giants standing in\r\nsteel helmets and green doublets and gilded corselets, to see the\r\nsoft and quiet beauty of the valley sleeping under their watch and\r\nward.  As the sun-bursts from the strath-skies above darted out of\r\ntheir shifting cloud-walls and flashed a flush of light upon the\r\nsolemn brows of these majestic apostles of nature one by one, they\r\nstood haloed, like the favored saints in Scripture in the overflow\r\nof the Transfiguration.  It was just the kind of day to make the\r\nscene glorious indescribably.  The clouds and sky were in the\r\nhappiest disposition for the brilliant plays and pictures of light\r\nand shade, and dissolving views of fascinating splendor succeeded\r\nand surpassed each other at a minute's interval.  Now, the great\r\nland-lake, on whose bosom floated in the sunlight a thousand islands\r\noat-and-barley-gilded, and rimmed with the green and purple verdure\r\nof the turnip and rutabaga, was all set a-glow by a luminous flood\r\nfrom the opening clouds above.  The next moment they closed this\r\ndisparted seam in their drapery, and opened a side one upon the\r\nstill, grave faces of the surrounding mountains; and, for a few\r\nminutes, the smile went round from one to the other, and the great\r\ncenturions of the hills looked happy and almost human in the gleam.\r\nThen shade's turn came in the play, and it played its part as\r\nperfectly as light.  It put in the touch of the old Italian masters,\r\ngiving an everchanging background to all the sublime pictures of the\r\npanorama.\r\n\r\nI was not alone in the enjoyment of this scenery.  For the first\r\ntime in this Walk I had a companion for a day.  A clergyman from\r\nnear Edinburgh joined me at Kingussie, with whom I shared the luxury\r\nof one of the most splendid views to be found in Scotland.  Indeed,\r\nfew minds are so constituted as to prefer to see such natural\r\npictures alone.  After a day's walk among these sceneries, we came\r\nto the small village of Aviemore in the dusk of the evening.  Here\r\nwe found that the only inn had been closed and turned into a private\r\nresidence, and that it was doubtful if a bed could be had for love\r\nor money in the place.  The railway through it to Inverness had just\r\nbeen opened, and the navvies seemed still to constitute the largest\r\nportion of the population.  Neither of us had eaten any dinner, and\r\nwe were hungry as well as tired.  Seeing a little, low cottage near\r\nthe railroad, with the sign of something for the public good over\r\nthe door, we went to it, and found that it had two rooms, one a kind\r\nof rough, stone-floored shed, the other an apartment full ten feet\r\nsquare, with two beds in it, which occupied half the entire space.\r\nBut, small as it was, the good man and woman made the most of it in\r\nthe way of entertainment, getting up a tea occasionally for persons\r\nstopping over in the village at a meal-time, also selling small\r\narticles of grocery to the laborers.  Everything was brought from a\r\ndistance, even their bread, bacon and butter.  Their stock of these\r\nfundamentals was exhausted, so that they could not give us anything\r\nwith our tea until the arrival of the train from the north, which we\r\nall watched with common interest.  In the course of half an hour it\r\ncame, and soon our cabin-landlord brought in a large basket full of\r\nthe simplest necessaries of life, which we were quite prepared to\r\nenjoy as its best luxuries.  Soon a wood fire blazed for us in the\r\ndouble-bedded parlor, and the unpainted deal table was spread in the\r\nfire-light with a repast we relished with a pleasant appreciation.\r\n\r\nMy companion was bound northward by the next train in that\r\ndirection, and was sure to find good quarters for the night; but as\r\nthere was not an inn for ten miles on the route I was to travel, and\r\nas it was now quite night and the road mostly houseless and lonely,\r\nI felt some anxiety about my own lodging.  But on inquiry I was very\r\nglad to find that one of the two beds in the room was unoccupied and\r\nat my disposal.  So, having accompanied my fellow-traveller to the\r\nstation and seen him off with mutual good wishes, I returned to the\r\ncottage, and the mistress replenished the fire with a new supply of\r\nchips and faggots, and I had two or three hours of rare enjoyment,\r\nenhanced by some interesting books I found on a shelf by the window.\r\nAnd this is a fact worthy of note and full of good meaning.  You\r\nwill seldom find a cottage in Scotland, however poor and small,\r\nwithout a shelf of books in it.  I retired rather earlier than\r\nusual; but before I fell asleep, the two regular lodgers, who\r\noccupied the other bed, came in softly, and spoke in a suppressed\r\ntone, as if reluctant to awaken me.  And here I was much impressed\r\nwith another fact affiliated with the one I have mentioned--that of\r\npraying as well as reading in the Scotch cottage.  After a little\r\nconversation just above a whisper, the elder of the two--and he not\r\ntwenty, while the other was apparently only sixteen--first read,\r\nwith full Scotch accent, one of the hard-rhymed psalms used in the\r\nScotch service.  Then, after a short pause, he read with a low,\r\nsolemn voice a chapter in the Bible.  A few minutes of silence\r\nsucceeded, as if a wordless prayer was going upward upon the still\r\nwings of thought, which made no audible beating in their flight.  It\r\nwas very impressive; an incident that I shall ever hold among the\r\nmost interesting of all I met with on my walk.  They were not\r\nbrothers evidently, but most likely strangers thrown together on the\r\nrailroad.  They doubtless came from different directions, but, from\r\nHighlands or Lowlands, they came from Bible-lighted homes, whose\r\n\"voices of the night\" were blended with the breathings of religious\r\nlife and instruction.  Separated from such homes, they had agreed to\r\nmake this one after the same spiritual pattern, barring the parental\r\npresence and teaching.\r\n\r\nThe next day after breakfast, took leave of my kind cottage hosts,\r\nexchanging good wishes for mutual happiness.  Went out of the\r\namphitheatre of Strathspey by a gateway into another, surrounded by\r\nmountains less lofty and entirely covered with heather.  For several\r\nmiles beyond Carr Bridge I passed over the wildest moorland.  The\r\nroad was marked by posts about ten feet high, painted white within\r\ntwo feet of the top and black above.  These are planted about\r\nfifteen rods apart, to guide the traveller in the drifting and\r\nblinding snows of winter.  The road over this cold, desolate waste\r\nexceeded anything I ever saw in America, even in the most\r\nfashionable suburbs of New York and Boston.  It was as smooth and\r\nhard as a cement floor.  Here on this treeless wild, I met several\r\nmen at work trimming the edges of the road by a line, with as much\r\nprecision and care as if they were laying out an aisle in a flower\r\ngarden.  After a walk of about seventeen miles, I reached Freeburn\r\nInn about the middle of the afternoon, and as it began to rain and\r\nto threaten bad weather for walking, I concluded to stop there for\r\nthe night, and found good quarters.\r\n\r\nThe rain continued in showers, and I feared I should be unable to\r\nreach Inverness to spend the Sabbath.  There was a cattle fair at\r\nthe inn, and a considerable number of farmers and dealers came\r\ntogether notwithstanding the weather.  Indeed, there were nearly as\r\nmany men and boys as animals on the ground.  A score or more had\r\ncome in, each leading or driving a single cow or calf.  The cattle\r\ngenerally were evidently of the Gaelic origin and antecedents--\r\nlittle, chubby, scraggy creatures, of all colors, but mostly black,\r\nwith wide-branching horns longer than their fore-legs.  Their hair\r\nis long and as coarse as a polar seal's, and they look as if they\r\nknew no more of housing against snow, rain and wintry winds, or of a\r\nlittered bed, than the buffaloes beyond the upper waters of the\r\nMissouri.  One would be inclined to think they had lived from calf-\r\nhood on nothing but heather or gorse, and that the prickly fodder\r\nhad penetrated through their hides and covered them with a growth\r\nmidway between hair and bristles.  They will not average over 350\r\nlbs. when dressed; still they seem to hold their own among other\r\nbreeds which have attracted so much attention.  This is probably\r\nbecause they can browse out a living where the Durham and Devon\r\nwould starve.\r\n\r\nThe sheep in this region are chiefly the old Scotch breed, with\r\ncurling horns and crocked faces and legs, such as are represented in\r\nold pictures.  The black seems to be spattered upon them, and looks\r\nas if the heather would rub it off.  The wool is long and coarse,\r\ngiving them a goat-like appearance.  They seem to predominate over\r\nany other breed in this part of Scotland, yet not necessarily nor\r\nadvantageously.  A large sheep farmer from England was staying at\r\nthe inn, with whom I had much conversation on the subject.  He said\r\nthe Cheviots were equally adapted to the Highlands, and thought they\r\nwould ultimately supplant the black faces.  Although he lived in\r\nNorthumberland, full two hundred miles to the south, he had rented a\r\nlarge sheep-walk, or mountain farm, in the Western Highlands, and\r\nhad come to this section to buy or hire another tract.  He kept\r\nabout 4,000 sheep, and intended to introduce the Cheviots upon these\r\nScotch holdings, as their bodies were much heavier and their wool\r\nworth nearly double that of the old black-faced breed.  Sheep are\r\nthe principal source of wealth in the whole of the North and West of\r\nScotland.  I was told that sometimes a flock of 20,000 is owned by\r\none man.  The lands on which they are pastured will not rent above\r\none or two English shillings per acre; and a flock even of 1,000\r\nrequires a vast range, as may be indicated by the reply of a Scotch\r\nfarmer to an English one, on being asked by the latter, \"How many\r\nsheep do you allow to the acre?\"  \"Ah, mon,\" was the answer, \"that's\r\nnae the way we count in the Highlands; it's how monie acres to the\r\nsheep.\"\r\n\r\nAt about two p.m., the showers becoming less frequent, I set out\r\nwith the hope of reaching Inverness before night.  The wind was\r\nhigh, the road muddy, or _dirty_, as the English call that\r\ncondition; and the rain frequently compelled me to seek shelter in\r\nsome wayside cottage, or under the fir-trees that were planted in\r\ngroves at narrow intervals.  The walking was heavy and slow in face\r\nof the frequent showers, and a strong gale from the north-east; so\r\nthat I was exceedingly glad to reach an inn within four miles of\r\nInverness, where I promised myself comfortable lodgings for the\r\nnight.  It was a rather large, but comfortless-looking house,\r\nevidently concentrating all its entertainment for travellers in the\r\ntap-room.  After considerable hesitation, the landlady consented to\r\ngive me bed and board; and directed \"the lassie\" to make a fire for\r\nme in a large and very respectable room on the second floor.  I soon\r\nbegan to feel quite at home by its side.  My boots had leaked on the\r\nway and my feet were very wet and cold; and it was with a pleasant\r\nsense of comfort that I changed stockings, and warmed myself at the\r\nruddy grate, while the storm seemed to increase without.  After\r\nwaiting about an hour for tea, I heard the lassie's heavy footstep\r\non the stairs; a knock--the door opens--now for the tray and the\r\nsteaming tea-pot, and happy vision of bread, oatcake and Scotch\r\n_scones_!  Alas! what a falling-off was there from this delicious\r\nexpectation!  The lassie had brought a severe and peremptory message\r\nfrom the master, who had just returned home.  And she delivered it\r\ncommiseratingly but decidedly.  She was to tell me from him that\r\nthere was nothing in the house to set before me; that the fair the\r\nday before had eaten out the whole stock of his provisions; in\r\nshort, that I was to take my staff and walk on to Inverness.  It was\r\nin vain that I remonstrated, pleaded and urged wet feet, the\r\ndarkness, the wind and rain.  \"It is so,\" said the lassie, \"and\r\ncan't be otherwise.\"  She tried to encourage me to the journey by\r\nshortening the distance by half its actual miles, saying it was only\r\ntwo, when it was full four, and they of the longest kind.  So I went\r\nout into the night in my wet clothes, and put the best face and foot\r\nto the head-wind and rain that I could bring to bear against them.\r\nBoth were strong, beating and drenching; and it was so dark that I\r\ncould hardly see the road.  In the course of half an hour, I made\r\nthe lassie's two miles, and in another, the whole of the actual\r\ndistance, and found comfortable quarters in one of the temperance\r\ninns of Inverness, reaching it between nine and ten at night.  Here\r\nI spent a quiet Sabbath, which I greatly enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVERNESS--ROSS-SHIRE--TAIN--DORNOCH--GOLSPIE--PROGRESS OF\r\nRAILROADS--THE SUTHERLAND EVICTION--SEA-COAST SCENERY--CAITHNESS--\r\nWICK:  HERRING FISHERIES--JOHN O'GROAT'S:  WALK'S END.\r\n\r\nInverness is an interesting, good-sized town, with an intellectual\r\nand pleasing countenance, of somewhat aristocratic and self-\r\ncomplacent expression.  It is considered the capital of the\r\nHighlands, and wears a decidedly metropolitan air.  It is well\r\nsituated on the Ness, just at its debouchement into the Moray\r\nFirth,--a river that runs with a Rhine-like current through the town\r\nand is spanned with a suspension bridge.  It has streets of city-\r\nbuilt and city-bred buildings, showing wealth and elegance.  Several\r\nedifices are in process of erection that will rank with some of the\r\nbest in Edinburgh and Glasgow.  It has a long and pretentious\r\nhistory, reaching back to the Romans, and dashed with the romance of\r\nthe wild ages of the country.  Oliver Cromwell, or Sledgehammer II.,\r\nMacbeth, Thane of Cawdor, Queen Mary, Prince Charlie, and other\r\nhistorical celebrities, entered their names and doings on the\r\nrecords of this goodly town.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Sept. 21st, I set out with a good deal of animation on\r\nthe last week-stage of my journey, which I was anxious to accomplish\r\nas soon as possible, as the weather was becoming unsettled with\r\nfrequent rain.  Reached Invergordon, passing through a most\r\ninteresting section of country, full of very fertile straths.  It\r\nwas the part of Ross-shire lying on the Moray and Beauly Firths and\r\ndivided by rivers dashing down through the wooded gorges of the\r\nmountains.  I saw here some of the most productive land in Scotland.\r\nHundreds of acres were studded with wheat and barley stooks, and\r\nabout an equal space was covered with standing grain, though so near\r\nthe month of October.  Plantations, parks, gentlemens' seats, glens\r\ndeep and grand, fir-clad mountains, villages, hamlets and scattered\r\ncottages made up the features of every changing view.  Indeed, one\r\ntravelling for a week between Perth and Inverness comes upon such a\r\nregion as this with pleasant surprise, as upon an exotic section,\r\nimported from another latitude.\r\n\r\nThe next day I held on northward, though the weather was very\r\nunfavorable and the walking heavy and fatiguing.  Passed what seemed\r\nthe bold and ridgy island of Cromarty, so associated with the\r\nvenerated memory of Hugh Miller.  The beating rain drove me\r\nfrequently to the wayside cottages for shelter; and in every one of\r\nthem I was received with kind words and pleasant looks.  One of\r\nthese was occupied by an old woman in the regular Scotch cap--a\r\nvenerable old saint, with her Bible and psalm-book library on her\r\nwindow-sill, and her peat fire burning cheerily.  When on leaving I\r\nintimated that I was from America, she followed me out into the\r\nroad, asking me a hundred questions about the country and its\r\ncondition.  She had three sons in Montreal, and felt a mother's\r\ninterest in the very name America.  The cottage was one of a long\r\nstreet of them by the sea-side, and I supposed it was a fishing\r\nvillage; but I learned from her that the people were mostly the\r\nevicted tenants of the Duke of Sutherland, who were turned out of\r\nhis county some thirty years ago to make room for sheep.  I made\r\nonly eleven miles this day on account of the rain, and was glad to\r\nfind cheery and comfortable quarters in an excellent inn kept by a\r\nwidow and her three daughters in Tain.  Nothing could exceed their\r\nkindness and attention, which evidently flowed more from a\r\ndisposition than from a professional habit of making their guests at\r\nhome for a pecuniary or business consideration.  I reached their\r\nhouse about the middle of the afternoon, cold and wet, after several\r\nhours' walk in the rain, and was received as one of the family; the\r\neldest daughter, who had all the grace and intelligence of a\r\ncultivated lady, helping me off with my wet overcoat, and even\r\noffering to pull off my water-soaked boots--an office no American\r\ncould accept, and which I gently declined, taking the will for the\r\ndeed.  A large number of Scotch _navvies_ were at the inns of the\r\ntown, making an obstreperous auroval in celebration of the monthly\r\npay-day.  They had received the day preceding a month's wages, and\r\nthey were now drinking up their money with the most reckless\r\nhilarity; swallowing the pay of five long hours at the pick in a\r\ncouple of gills of whiskey.  How strange that men can work in rain,\r\ncold and heat at the shovel for a whole day, then drink up the whole\r\nin two hours at the gin-shop!  These pickmen pioneers of the Iron\r\nHorse, with their worst habits, are yet a kind of John-the-Baptists\r\nto the march and mission of civilization, preparing its way in the\r\nwilderness, and bringing secluded and isolated populations to its\r\nlight and intercourse.  It is wonderful how they are working their\r\nway northward among these bald and thick-set mountains.  When I\r\nfirst visited Scotland, in 1846, the only piece of railroad north of\r\nthe Forth was that between Dundee and Arbroath, hardly an hour long.\r\nNow the iron pathways are running in every direction, making grand\r\njunctions at points which had never felt the navvy's pick a dozen\r\nyears ago.  Here is one heading towards John O'Groat's, grubbing its\r\nway like a mole around the firths, cutting spiral gains into the\r\nrock-ribbed hills, bridging the deep and dark gorges, and holding on\r\nsteadily north-poleward with a brave faith and faculty of patience\r\nthat moves mountains, or as much of them as blocks its course.  The\r\nprogress is slow, silent, but sure.  The world, busy in other\r\ndoings, does not hear the pick, nor the speech of the powder when it\r\nspeaks to a huge rock a-straddle the path.  The world, even\r\nincluding the shareholders, hears but little, if anything, of the\r\nprogress of the work for months, perhaps for a year.  Then the\r\nconsummation is announced in the form of an invitation to the public\r\nto \"assist\" at the opening of a railroad through towns and villages\r\nthat never saw the daylight the locomotive brings in its wake.  So\r\nit will be here.  Some day, in the present decade, there will be an\r\nexcursion train advertised to run from London to John O'Groat's; and\r\nperhaps the lineal descendant of Sigurd, or some other old Norse\r\njarl, will wear the conductor's belt and cap or drive the engine.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still unsettled, with much wind and rain.  Resumed\r\nmy walk, and at about four miles from Tain, crossed the Dornoch\r\nFirth in a sail ferry boat, and at noon reached Dornoch, the capital\r\nof Sutherlandshire.  This was one of the fourteen cities of\r\nScotland; and its little, chubby cathedral, and the tower of the old\r\nbishop's palace still give it a kind of Canterbury air.  The Earls\r\nof Sutherland for many generations lie interred within the walls of\r\nthis ancient church.  After stopping here for an hour or two for\r\ndinner, I continued on to Golspie, the residence of the mighty lord\r\nof the manor, or the owner, master and human disposer of this great\r\nmountain county of Scotland.  It is stated that full four-fifths of\r\nit belong to him who now holds the title, and that his other great\r\nestates, added to this territory, make him the largest landowner in\r\nGreat Britain and probably in Europe.  Just before reaching Golspie,\r\na lofty, sombre mountain, with its bald head enveloped in the mist,\r\nand which I had been two hours apparently in passing, cleared away\r\nand revealed its full stature--and more.  Towering up from its\r\ntopmost summit, a tall column lifted a human figure in bronze\r\nskyward cloud-high and frequently higher still.  I believe the\r\nbrazen face that thus looks into the pure and holy skies without\r\nblushing, is a duplicate of the one worn in human flesh by His\r\nGrace, Evictor I., who unpeopled his great county of many thousands\r\nof human inhabitants, and made nearly its whole area of 18,000\r\nsquare miles a sheep-walk.  But I will not break the seal of that\r\nhistory.  It was full of bitter experience to multitudes.  Not for\r\nthe time being was it joyous, but grievous exceedingly--surpassing\r\nendurance to many.  But it is all over now.  The ship-loads of\r\nevicted men and women who looked their last upon Scotland while its\r\nmountains and glens were reddened with the flames of their burning\r\ncottages, carried away with them a bitter feeling in their hearts\r\nwhich years of better experience did not soften.  Not for their good\r\ndid it seem in the motive of the transaction; but for their good it\r\nworked most blessedly.  It was a rough transplanting, and the\r\ntenderest fibres of human affection broke and bled under the\r\nuptearing; but they took root in the Western World, and grew\r\nluxuriantly under the light and dew of a happier destiny.  It was\r\nhard for fathers and mothers who were taking on the frostwork of age\r\nupon their brows; but for their children it was the birth of a new\r\nlife; for them it was the introduction to a future which had a sun\r\nin it, rayful and radiant with the beams of hope and promise.  Let\r\nthose who denounce and deplore this harsh unpeopling come and stand\r\nupon the cold, bleak summit of one of these Sutherland mountains.\r\nLet them bring their compasses, or some other instrument for\r\nmeasuring the angles, sines and cosines of human conditions.  Plant\r\nyour theodolite here; wipe the telescope's eye with your\r\nhandkerchief; look your keenest in the line of the lineage of these\r\nevicted thousands.  Steady, now! while the most tranquil light of\r\nthe future is on the pathway of your eye.  This first reach of your\r\nvision is the life-track of the fathers and mothers unhoused among\r\nthese mountains.  Look on beyond, over the longer life-line of their\r\nchildren; then farther still under the horizon of the remotest\r\nfuture to the track of their childrens' children.  Can you make an\r\nangle of a single degree's subtension in the hereditary conditions\r\nof these generations, or a dozen beyond?  Can you detect a point of\r\ndeparture by which the second generation would have diverged from\r\nthe first, or the third from the second, and have attained to a\r\nhigher life of comfort, intelligence, social and political position\r\nhad they remained in these mountain cottages, grubbed on their\r\ncottage farms, and lived from hand to mouth on stinted rations of\r\noatmeal and potatoes, as their ancestors had done from time\r\nimmemorial?  Can you see among all the hopeful possibilities of\r\nTime's tomorrows, any such change for the better?  You can sight no\r\nsuch prospect with your telescope in that direction.  Turn it around\r\nand sweep the horizon of that other condition into which they were\r\nthrust, weeping and wrathful against their will.  Follow them across\r\nthe Atlantic to North America, to their homes in the States and in\r\nthe Canadas.  Measure the angle they made in this transposition, and\r\nthe latitude and longitude of social and moral life they have\r\nreached from this Sutherland point of departure.  The sons of the\r\nfathers and mothers who had their family nests stirred up so\r\ncruelly, and scattered, like those of rooks, from their holdings in\r\nthe cliffs, gorges and glens of these cold mountains, are now among\r\nthe most substantial and respected men of the Western World.  Some\r\nof them to-day are mayors of towns of larger population than the\r\nwhole county of Sutherland.  Some, doubtless, are Members of\r\nCongress, representing each a constituency of one hundred thousand\r\npersons, and a vast amount of intelligence, wealth and industry.\r\nThey are merchants, manufacturers, farmers, teachers and preachers,\r\nfilling all the professions and occupations of the continent.  Is\r\nnot that an angle of promise to your telescope?  Is not that a line\r\nof divergence which has conducted these evicted populations, at a\r\nsmall distance from this point of departure, into the better\r\nlatitudes of human experience?  The selling of this Scotch Joseph to\r\nAmerica was more purely and simply a pecuniary transaction than that\r\nrecorded in Scripture; for in that the unkind and jealous brothers\r\nsold the innocent boy for envy, not for the love of pelf, though the\r\nIshmaelites bought him on speculation.  But not for envy was the\r\nSutherland lad sold and shipped to a foreign land, but rather for a\r\ncontemptuous estimate of his money value.  The proprietor-patriarch\r\nof the county took to a more quiet and profitable favorite--the\r\nsheep, and sent it to feed on a pasture enriched with the ashes of\r\nJoseph's cottage.  It is to be feared he meant only money; but\r\nProvidence meant a blessing beyond the measurement of money to the\r\nevicted; and what Providence meant it made for him and his\r\nposterity, and they are now enjoying it.\r\n\r\nDunrobin Castle, the grand residence of the Duke of Sutherland,\r\nlooks off upon the sea at Golspie.  It is truly a magnificent\r\nedifice, ranking with the first palaces in Christendom.  Nearly\r\neight hundred years has it been in building, though, I believe, all\r\nthat commands admiration for stature and style is the work of the\r\npresent century.  Whatever the Sutherland family may have been in\r\nlocal position and history in past centuries, one of the noblest\r\nwomen that ever ennobled the nobility of Great Britain, has given\r\nthe name a celebrity and an estimation in America which all who ever\r\nwore it before never won for it.  The Duchess of Sutherland, the\r\nnoble and large-hearted sister of Lord Morpeth-Carlisle, has given\r\nto the coronet she wore a lustre brighter to the American eye than\r\nthe light of diadems which have dazzled millions in Europe.  When\r\nthe Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Men shall come to its\r\nhigh place in the hearts of nations as the crown-faith of all their\r\ncreeds, what this noble woman felt, said and did for the Slave in\r\nhis bonds shall be mentioned of her by the preachers of that great\r\ndoctrine in years to come.  When the jewels of Humanity's memories\r\nshall be made up, she who, as it were, bent down to him in his\r\nprison-house and put her jewelled hands to the breaking of his\r\nfetters, shall stand, with women of the same sympathy, only next to\r\nher who broke her box of ointment on the Saviour's feet.\r\n\r\nThe next day made a walk to Helmsdale, a distance of about eighteen\r\nmiles.  The weather was favorable, the scenery grand and varied with\r\nalmost every feature that could give it interest.  The finest of\r\nroads wound in and out around the mountain headlands, so that\r\nalternately I was walking upon a lofty esplanade overlooking the\r\nstill expanse of the steel-blue sea, then facing inward to the\r\ngorges of the grand and solemn hills.  Found comfortable quarters in\r\none of the inns of Helmsdale, a vigorous, busy, fishing village\r\nnestling under the shadow of the mountains at the mouth of a little\r\nriver of the same name.  After tea, went down to the wharf or quay\r\nand had some conversation with one of the masters of the business.\r\nHe cured and put up about 30,000 barrels of herrings himself in a\r\nseason, employing, while it lasted, 500 persons.  Their chief market\r\nis the North of Europe, especially Poland, and the business was\r\nconsequently much depressed on account of the troubles in that\r\ncountry.  The occupation of this little sea-side village illustrated\r\nthe ramifications of commerce.  They imported their salt from\r\nLiverpool, their staves from Norway and their hoops from London.\r\n\r\nSet out again immediately after breakfast, feeling that I was\r\ndrawing near to the end of my journey.  I was soon in the treeless\r\ncounty of Caithness, so fraught with the wild romance of the\r\nNorsemen.  Passed over the bleakest district I had yet seen, called\r\nOld Ord, a cold, rough, cloud-breeding region that the very heavens\r\nabove seem to frown upon with a scowl of dissatisfaction.  Still,\r\nthe road over this dark, mountain desert, though staked on each side\r\nto keep the traveller from wandering in the blinding snows of\r\nwinter, was as beautifully kept as the carriage-way in the park of\r\nDunrobin Castle.  The sending of an English queen to conciliate the\r\nWelsh, by giving birth to a son in one of their castles, was not a\r\nmuch better stroke of policy than that of England in perforating\r\nScotland to the Northern Sea with this unparalleled and splendid\r\nroad, constructed at first for a military purpose.  I heard a man\r\nrepeat a couplet, probably of unwritten poetry, in popular vogue\r\namong the Highlands, and which has quite an Irish collocation of\r\nideas.  It is spoken thus, as far as I can recollect--\r\n\r\n     Who knew these roads ere they were made\r\n     Should bless the Lord for General Wade.\r\n\r\nI doubt if there are ten consecutive miles of carriage-road in\r\nAmerica that could compare for excellence with that over the desert\r\nof Old Ord.  I was overtaken by a heavy shower before I had made the\r\ntrajet, and was glad to reach one of the most comfortable inns of\r\nthe Highlands, in the beautiful, romantic and picturesque glen of\r\nBerriedale.  Here, nestling between lofty mountain ridges, which\r\nwarded off the blasting sea-winds sweeping across from Norway, were\r\nplantations and groves of trees, almost the only ones I saw in the\r\ncounty.  Nothing could exceed the hospitality of the family that\r\nkept the large, white-faced hotel at the bottom of this pleasant\r\nvalley; especially after I incidentally said that I had walked all\r\nthe way from London to see the country and people.  They admitted me\r\ninto the kitchen and gave me a seat by the great peat fire, where I\r\nhad a long talk with them, beginning with the mother.  Having\r\nintimated that I was an American, the whole family, old and young,\r\nincluding the landlord, gathered around me and had a hundred\r\nquestions to ask.  They related many incidents about the great\r\neviction in Sutherland, which was an event that seems to make a\r\nlarge stock of legendary and unwritten stories, like the old Sagas\r\nof the Northmen.  When I had dried my clothes and eaten a\r\ncomfortable dinner before their kitchen fire and resumed my staff,\r\nthey all followed me out to the road, and then with their wishes for\r\na good journey as long as I was in hearing distance.  Continued my\r\nwalk around headlands, now looking seaward, now mountainward, now\r\nascending on heather-bound esplanades, now descending in zig-zag\r\ndirections into deep glens, over massive and elegant bridges that\r\nspanned the mountain streams and their steep and jagged banks.\r\nAfter a walk of eighteen miles, put up at an inn a little north of\r\nthe village of Dunbeath, kept by an intelligent and industrious\r\nfarmer.  The rain had continued most of the day, and I was obliged\r\nto seek shelter sometimes under a stunted tree which helped out the\r\nprotecting power of a weather-beaten umbrella; now in the doorway of\r\nan open stable or cow-shed, and once with my back against the door\r\nof a wayside church, which kept off the rain in one direction.  This\r\nbeing a kind of border-season between summer and autumn, there were\r\nno fires in the inns generally except in the kitchen, and I soon\r\nlearned to make for that, and always found a kindly welcome to its\r\ncomforts; though sometimes the good woman and her lassie would look\r\na little flushed at having their busiest culinary operations\r\nrevealed so suddenly to a stranger.  Some of these kitchens are\r\nfitted for sleeping apartments; occasionally having two tiers of\r\nberths like a ship's cabin, slightly and rudely curtained.\r\n\r\nThe family of this wayside inn, seemingly like every other family in\r\nthe country, had connections in America, embracing brothers, uncles\r\nand cousins.  I was shown a little paper casket of hair flower-work,\r\nsent by _post_!  It was wrought of locks of every shade and tint,\r\nfrom the snow of a grandmother over one hundred years of age to the\r\nlittle, sunny curls of the youngest child in the circle of kindred\r\nfamilies.  The Scotch branch had collected specimens from relatives\r\nin Great Britain and forwarded them to the family in America, one of\r\nwhose daughters had worked them into two bouquets of flowers,\r\nsending one of them by post to this little, white cottage on the\r\nNorthern Sea, as a memento of affection.  What enhanced the beauty\r\nof this interchange was the fact, that forty-eight years had elapsed\r\nsince the landlord's brother left his native land for New England,\r\nand had never seen it since.  Still, the cousins, who had never seen\r\neach other's faces, had kept up an affectionate correspondence.  A\r\nson and son-in-law of the brother in America were in the Federal\r\narmy, and here was a sea-divided family filled with all the sad,\r\nsilent solicitude of affection for beloved ones exposed to the\r\nfearful hazards of a war sundering more ties of blood-relationship\r\nthan any other ever waged on earth.\r\n\r\nSaturday, September 27th.  Resumed my walk with increased animation,\r\nfeeling myself within two days' distance of its end.  The scenery\r\nsoftens down to an agricultural aspect, the country declining\r\nnortherly toward the sea.  Passed through a well-cultivated\r\ndistrict, never unpeopled or wasted by eviction, but held by a kind\r\nof even yeomanry of proprietors.  The cottages are comfortable,\r\nresembling the white houses of New England considerably.  They are\r\nnearly all of one story, with a chimney at each end, broadside to\r\nthe road, and a door in the middle, dividing the house into two\r\napartments.  They are built of stone, the newest ones having a slate\r\nroof.  Some of them are whitewashed, others so liberally jointed\r\nwith mortar as to give them a bright and cheery appearance.  These,\r\nof course, are the last edition of cottages, enlarged and amended in\r\nevery way.  The old issues are ragged volumes, mostly bound in turf\r\nor bog grass, well corded down with ropes of heather, giving the\r\nroof a singular ribby look, rounded on the ridge.  In many cases a\r\nstone is attached to each end of the rope, so as to make it hug the\r\nthatch closely.  I noticed that in a considerable number of the old\r\ncottages, the stone wall only reached up a foot or two from the\r\nground, the rest being made up of blocks of peat.  Some of the\r\noldest had no premonitory symptoms of a chimney, except a hole in\r\nthe roof for the smoke.  These in no way differed from the stone-\r\nand-turf cottages in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAgain occasional showers brought me into acquaintance with the\r\npeople living near the road.  In every case I found them kind and\r\nhospitable, giving me a pleasant welcome and the best seat by their\r\npeat-fire.  I sat by one an hour while the rain fell cold and fast\r\noutside.  The good woman and her daughter were busy baking barley-\r\ncakes.  They were the first I had seen, and I ate them with a\r\npeculiar zest of appetite.  Told them many stories about America in\r\nreturn for a great deal of information about the customs and\r\ncondition of the working-people.  They generally built their own\r\ncottages, costing from 40 to 50 pounds, not counting their own\r\nlabor.  I met on the road scores of fishermen returning to their\r\nhomes at the conclusion of the herring season; and was struck with\r\ntheir appearance in every way.  They are truly a stalwart race of\r\nmen, broad-chested, of intelligent physiognomy, with Scandinavian\r\nfeatures fully developed.  A half dozen of them followed a horse-\r\ncart containing their nets, all done up in a round ball, like a\r\nbladder of snuff, with the number of their boat marked upon it.\r\n\r\nAt about four p.m., I came in sight of the steeples of Wick, a brave\r\nlittle city by the Norse Sea, which may not only be called the Wick\r\nbut the Candle of Northern Scotland; lighting, like a polar star,\r\nthis hyperborean shoreland of the British isle.  I never entered a\r\ntown with livelier pleasure.  It is virtually the last and farthest\r\non the mainland in this direction.  Its history is full of interest.\r\nIts great business is full of vigor, daring and danger.  Here is the\r\ngreat land-home of the Vikings of the nineteenth century; the\r\nindomitable men who walk the roaring and crested billows of this\r\nNorthern Ocean in their black, tough sea-boats and bring ashore the\r\nhard-earned spoils of the deep.  This is the great metropolis of\r\nFishdom.  Eric the Red, nor any other pre-Columbus navigator of the\r\nNorth American Seas, ever mustered braver crews than these sea-boats\r\ncarry to their morning beats.  Ten thousand of as hardy men as ever\r\nwrestled with the waves, and threw them too, are out upon that wide\r\nwater-wold before the sun looks on it--half of them wearing the\r\nfeatures of their Norse lineage, as light-haired and crisp-whiskered\r\nas the sailors of Harold the Fair-haired a thousand years ago.  They\r\ncome from all the coasts of Scotland, from Orkney, Shetland, the\r\nHebrides and Lewis islands, and down out of the heart of the\r\nHighlands.  It is a hard and daring industry they follow, and\r\nhundreds of graves on the shore and thousands at the bottom of the\r\nsea have been made with no names on them, as the long record of the\r\nhazards they run in the perilous occupation.  But they keep their\r\nranks full from year to year, pushing out new boats marked with\r\nhigher numbers.\r\n\r\nThe harbor has been dangerous and difficult of access, but of late a\r\ngreat effort has been made to render it more safe and commodious.\r\nThe Scotch fisheries now yield from 600,000 to 700,000 barrels of\r\nherrings annually, employing about 17,000 fishermen; Wick stands\r\nfirst among all the fishing ports of the kingdom.  It is a thriving\r\ntown, well supplied with churches, schools, hotels, banks and\r\nprinting-offices.  Several new buildings are now being erected which\r\nwill rank high in architecture and add new features of elegance to\r\nthe place.  The population is a vigorous, intelligent, highly moral\r\nand well-read community, as I could not fail to notice on attending\r\nservice on the Sabbath at different places of worship.  Wick is\r\nhonored with this distinction--it assembles a larger congregation of\r\nmen to listen to the glad Evangel on Sunday than any city of the\r\nworld ever musters under one roof for the same purpose.  It is the\r\nout-door church of the fishermen.  They sometimes number 5,000 adult\r\nmen, sea-beaten and sun-burnt, gathered in from mountainous island\r\nand mainland all around the northern coasts of Scotland.\r\n\r\nMonday, Sept. 28th.  The weather was favorable, and I set out on my\r\nlast day's walk northward with a sense of satisfaction I could\r\nhardly describe.  The scenery was beautiful in every direction.  The\r\nroad was perfect up to the last rod; as well kept as if it ran\r\nthrough a nobleman's park.  The country most of the way was well\r\ncultivated--oats being the principal crop.  Here, almost within\r\nsight of the Orkneys, I heard the clatter of the reaping machine,\r\nwhich, doubtless, puts out the same utterance over and upon the sea\r\nat Land's End.  It has travelled fast and far since 1851, when it\r\nfirst made its appearance in Europe in the Crystal Palace, as one of\r\nthe wild, impracticable \"notions\" of American genius.  In Wick I\r\nvisited a newspaper establishment, and saw in operation one of the\r\nold \"Columbians,\" or the American printing-press, surmounted by the\r\neagle of the Republic.  The sewing-machine is in all the towns and\r\nvillages on the island.  If there is not an American clock at John\r\nO'Groat's, I hope some of my fellow townsmen will send one there,\r\nBristol-built.  They are pleasant tokens of free-labor genius.  No\r\nland tilled by slaves could produce them.  I saw many large and\r\nhighly-cultivated farms on these last miles of my walk.  The country\r\nwas proportionately divided between food and fuel.  Oats and barley\r\nconstitute the grain-crops.  The uncultivated land interspersed with\r\nthe yellow fields of harvest, is reserved for _peat_--the poor man's\r\nfuel and his wealth.  For, were it not for the inexhaustible\r\nabundance of this cheap and accessible firing, he could hardly\r\ninhabit this region.  It would seem strange to an American, who had\r\nnot realised the difference of the two climates, to see fields full\r\nof reapers on the very threshold of October, as I saw them on this\r\nlast day's walk.  I counted twelve women and two men in one field\r\nplying the sickle, all strongly-built and good-looking and well-\r\ndressed withal.\r\n\r\nThe sea was still and blue as a lake.  A lark was soaring and\r\nwarbling over it with as happy and hopeful a voice as if it were\r\nsinging over the greenest acres of an English meadow.  When I had\r\nmade half of the seventeen miles between Wick and John O'Groat's, I\r\nbegan to look with the liveliest interest for the first glimpse of\r\nthe Orkneys; but projecting and ragged headlands intercepted the\r\nprospect.  About three p.m., as the road emerged from behind one of\r\nthem, those famous islands burst suddenly into view!  There they\r\nwere!--in full sight, so near that their grain-fields and white\r\ncottages and all their distinguishing features seemed within half a\r\nmile's distance.  This was the most interesting coup d'oeil that I\r\never caught in any country.  Here, then, after weeks and months of\r\ntravel on foot, I was at the end of my journey.  Through all the\r\ndays of this period I had faced northward, and here was the Ultima\r\nThule, the goal and termination of my tour.  The road to the sea\r\ndiverged from the main turnpike, which continued around the coast to\r\nThurso.  Followed this branch a couple of miles, when it ended at\r\nthe door of a little, quiet, one-story inn on the very shore of the\r\nPentland Firth.  It was a moment of the liveliest enjoyment to me.\r\nWhen I left London, about the middle of July, I was slowly\r\nrecovering from a severe indisposition, and hardly expected to be\r\nable to make more than a few miles of my projected walk.  But I had\r\ngathered strength daily, and when I brought up at this little inn at\r\nthe very jumping-off end of Scotland, I was fresher and more\r\nvigorous on foot than at any previous stage of the journey.\r\n\r\nHaving found to my great satisfaction that they could give me a bed\r\nfor the night, I went with two gentlemen of the neighborhood to see\r\nthe site of the celebrated John O'Groat's House, about a mile and a\r\nhalf from the inn.  There was only a footpath to it across\r\nintervening fields, and when we reached it, a rather vigorous\r\nexercise of the organ of individuality was requisite to \"locate\" the\r\nfoundations of \"the house that Jack built.\"  Indeed, pilgrims to the\r\nshrine of this famous domicile are liable to much disappointment at\r\nfinding so little remaining of a residence so historical.  Literally\r\nnot one stone is left upon another.  A large stone granary standing\r\nnear is said to have been built of the debris of the house, and this\r\nhelps out one's faith when struggling to believe in the existence of\r\nsuch a building at all.  A certain ridgy rising in the ground, to\r\nwhich you try to give an octagonal shape, is pointed out as\r\nindicating the foundations; but an unsatisfactory obscurity rests\r\nupon the whole history of the establishment.  Whether true or not,\r\nthat history of the house which one would prefer to believe runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\nIn the reign of James IV. of Scotland, three brothers, Malcolm,\r\nGavin, and John de Groat, natives of Holland, came to this coast of\r\nCaithness, with a letter in Latin from that monarch recommending\r\nthem to the protection and countenance of his subjects hereabout.\r\nThey got possession of a large district of land, and in process of\r\ntime multiplied and prospered until they numbered eight different\r\nproprietors by the name of Groat.  On one of the annual dinners\r\ninstituted to commemorate their arrival in Caithness, a dispute\r\narose as to the right of precedency in taking the door and the head\r\nof the table.  This waxed very serious and threatened to break up\r\nthese annual gatherings.  But the wisdom and virtue of John\r\nprevented this rupture.  He made a touching speech to them, soothing\r\ntheir angry spirits with an appeal to the common and precious\r\nmemories of their native land and to all their joint experiences in\r\nthis.  He entreated them to return to their homes quietly, and he\r\nwould remedy the current difficulty at the next meeting.  Won by his\r\nkindly spirit and words, they complied with his request.  In the\r\ninterval, John built a house expressly for the purpose, of an\r\noctagonal form, with eight doors and windows.  He then placed a\r\ntable of oak, of the same shape, in the middle; and when the next\r\nmeeting took place, he desired each head of the different Groat\r\nfamilies to enter at his own door and sit at the head of his own\r\ntable.  This happy and ingenious plan restored good feeling and a\r\npleasant footing to the sensitive families, and gave to the good\r\nDutchman's name an interest which it will carry with it forever.\r\n\r\nAfter filling my pockets with some beautiful little shells strewing\r\nthe site of the building, called \"John O'Groat's buckies,\" I\r\nreturned to the inn.  One of the gentlemen who accompanied me was\r\nthe tenant of the farm which must have been John's homestead,\r\ncontaining about two hundred acres.  It was mostly in oats, still\r\nstanding, with a good promise of forty bushels to the acre.  He\r\nresided at Thurso, some twenty miles distant, and found no\r\ndifficulty in carrying on the estate through a hired foreman.  I\r\nnever passed a more enjoyable evening than in the little, cozy, low-\r\njointed parlor of this sea-side inn.  Scotch cakes never had such a\r\nrelish for me nor a peat-fire more comfortable fellowship of\r\npleasant fancies, as I sat at the tea-table.  There was a moaning of\r\nwinds down the Pentland Firth--a clattering and chattering of window\r\nshutters, as if the unrestful spirits of the old Vikings and Norse\r\nheroes were walking up and down the scene of their wild histories\r\nand gibbering over their feats and fates.  Spent an hour or two in\r\nwriting letters to friends in England and America, to tell them of\r\nmy arrival at this extreme goal of my walk, and a full hour in\r\nporing over the visitors' book, in which there were names from all\r\ncountries in Christendom, and also impressions and observations in\r\nprose, poetry, English, French, Latin, German and other languages.\r\nMany of the comments thus recorded intimated some dissatisfaction\r\nthat John O'Groat's House was so _mythical_; that so much had to be\r\nsupplied by the imagination; that not even a stone of the foundation\r\nremained in its place to assist fancy to erect the building into a\r\npositive fact of history.  But they all bore full and sometimes\r\nfervid testimony to the good cheer of the inn at the hands of the\r\nlandlady.  There was one record which blended loyalty to palate and\r\npatriotism--\"The Roast Beef of Old England\" and \"God save the\r\nQueen\"--rather amusingly.  A party wrote their impressions after\r\nthis manner--\"Visited John O'Groat's House; found little to see;\r\ncame back tired and hungry; walked into a couple of tender chickens\r\nand a good piece of bacon:  God save Mrs. Manson and all the Royal\r\nFamily!\"  This concluding \"sentiment\" was doubtless sincere and\r\nhonest, although it involved a question of precedence in the rank of\r\ntwo feelings which John the Dutchman could have hardly settled by\r\nhis eight-angled plan of adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, for the first time for nearly three months of\r\ncontinuous travel, I faced southward, leaving behind me the Orkneys\r\nunvisited, though I had a strong desire to see those celebrated\r\nislands--the theatre of so much interesting history.  Twenty years\r\nago I translated all the \"Sagas\" relating to the voyages and\r\nexploits of the Northmen in these northern seas and islands, their\r\nexplorations of the coast of North America centuries before Columbus\r\nwas born, their doings in Iceland and on all the islands great and\r\nsmall now forming the British realms.  This gave an additional zest\r\nto my enjoyment in standing on the shore of the Pentland Firth and\r\nlooking over upon the scene of old Haco's and Sigurd's doing, daring\r\nand dying.\r\n\r\nFooted it back to Wick, and there terminated my walk, having\r\nmeasured, step by step, full seven hundred miles since I left\r\nLondon, counting in the divergences from a straight line which I had\r\nmade.  In the evening I addressed a large and intelligent audience\r\nwhich had been convened at short notice, and I never stood up before\r\none with such peculiar satisfaction as in that North-star town of\r\nScotland.  I had travelled nearly the whole distance incog., without\r\nhearing my own name on a pair of human lips for weeks.  To lay aside\r\nthis embargo and to speak to such a large congregation, face to\r\nface, was like coming back again into the great communions of\r\nhumanity after a long and private fellowship with the secluded\r\nquietudes of Nature.\r\n\r\nAt four p.m. the next day, I took the Thurso coach and passed over\r\nin the night the whole distance that had occupied me a week in\r\ntravelling by staff.  Stopped a night in Inverness, another at\r\nElgin, and spent the Sabbath with my friend, Anthony Cruickshank, at\r\nSittyton, about fifteen miles north of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHONY CRUICKSHANK--THE GREATEST HERD OF SHORTHORNS IN THE WORLD--\r\nRETURN TO LONDON AND TERMINATION OF MY TOUR.\r\n\r\nSittyton designates hardly a village in Aberdeenshire, but it has\r\nbecome a point of great interest to the agricultural world--a second\r\nBabraham.  In this quiet, rural district, Anthony Cruickshank, a\r\nquiet, modest, meek-voiced member of the Society of Friends,\r\n\"generally called Quakers,\" has made a history and a great\r\nenterprise of vast value to the world.  He is one of those four-\r\nhanded but one-minded men who, with a pair to each, build up\r\nsimultaneously two great businesses so symmetrically that you would\r\nthink they gave their whole intellect, will and genius to one.\r\nAnthony Cruickshank, the Quaker of Sittyton, has made but little\r\nmore noise in the world than Nature makes in building up some of her\r\ngreat and beautiful structures.  His footsteps were so light and\r\ngentle that few knew that he was running at all, until they saw him\r\nlead the racers by a head at the end of the course.  The world is\r\nwide, and dews of every temperature fall upon its meadow and pasture\r\nlands.  Vast regions are fresh and green all the year round,\r\nyielding food for cattle seemingly in the best conditions created\r\nfor their growth and perfection.  The highest nobility and gentry of\r\nthis and other countries are giving to the living statuary of these\r\nanimals that science, taste and genius which the most enthusiastic\r\nartists are giving to the still but speaking statuary of the canvas.\r\nThe competition in this cultivation of animal life is wide and\r\neager, and spreading fast over Christendom; emperors, kings,\r\nprinces, dukes and belted barons are on the lists.  Antipodean\r\nagriculturists meet in the great international concours of cattle,\r\nhorses, sheep and swine.  Never was royal blood or the inheritance\r\nof a crown threaded through divergent veins to its source with more\r\ncare and pride than the lineage of these four-footed \"princes\" and\r\n\"princesses,\" \"dukes\" and \"duchesses,\" and \"knights\" and \"ladies\" of\r\nthe stable and pasture.  No peerage ever kept a more jealous\r\nheraldry than the herd-book of this great quadruped noblesse.  The\r\nworld, by consent, has crowned the Shorthorn Durham as the best\r\nblood that ever a horned animal carried in its veins.  Princely\r\nconnoisseurs and amateurs, and all the dilettanti as well as\r\npractical agriculturists of Christendom, are giving more thought to\r\nthe perfection and perpetuation of this blood than to any other name\r\nand breed.  Still--and this distinction is crowned with double merit\r\nby the fact--Anthony Cruickshank, draper of Aberdeen, has worked his\r\nway, gradually and noiselessly, to the very head and front of the\r\nShorthorn knighthood of the world.  While pursuing the occupation to\r\nwhich he was bred with as much assiduity and success as if it had\r\nevery thought and activity which a man should give to a business, he\r\nbuilt up, at a considerable distance from his warehouse, an\r\nenterprise of an entirely different nature, to a magnitude which no\r\nother man has ever equalled.  He now owns the largest herd of\r\nShorthorns in the world, breeding and feeding them to the highest\r\nperfection in the cold and naturally unfertile county of Aberdeen,\r\nwhich no man of less patience and perseverance would select as the\r\nground on which to enter the lists against such an array of\r\ncompetitors in Great Britain and other countries.  I regret that my\r\nNotes have already expanded to such a volume as to preclude a more\r\nextended account of his operations in this great field of\r\nusefulness.  A few simple facts will suffice to give the reader an\r\napproximate idea of what he has done in this department.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1825, young Cruickshank was put to a Friends' school\r\nin Cumberland.  He was a farmer's son, and seems to have conceived a\r\ngreat fancy for cattle from childhood.  A gentleman resided not far\r\nfrom the school, who was an owner and amateur of Shorthorns, and\r\nAnthony would frequently spend his half-holidays with him,\r\ninspecting and admiring his herd, and asking him questions about\r\ntheir qualities and his way of treating them.  From this school he\r\nwas sent as an apprentice to a trading establishment in Edinburgh,\r\nand at the end of his term set up business for himself as a draper\r\nin Aberdeen.  All through this period he carried with him his first\r\ninterest in cattle-culture, but was unable to make a beginning in it\r\nuntil 1837, when he purchased a single Shorthorn cow in the county\r\nof Durham, and soon afterward two other animals of the same blood.\r\nThese constituted the nucleus of his herd at Sittyton.  One by one\r\nhe added other animals of the same stock, purchased in different\r\nparts of England, Ireland and Scotland.  With these accessions by\r\npurchase, and from natural increase, his herd grew rapidly and\r\nprospered finely, so that he was obliged to add field to field and\r\nfarm to farm to produce feed for such a number of mouths.  In a few\r\nyears he reached his present maximum which he does not wish to\r\nexceed.  That is, his herd now averages annually three hundred head\r\nof this noble and beautiful race of animals, or the largest number\r\nof them owned by any one man in the world.  In 1841, he announced\r\nhis first sale of young bulls, and every year since that date has\r\nput up at public auction the male progeny of the herd.  These sales\r\nusually take place in the first week of October, and are attended by\r\nfrom 300 to 500 persons from all parts of the kingdom.  After\r\ncarefully inspecting the various lots, they adjourn to a substantial\r\nluncheon at twelve o'clock, and at one p.m. they repair to the sale\r\nring and the bidding begins in good earnest, and the auctioneer's\r\nhammer falls quick and often, averaging about a minute and a half to\r\neach lot.  Thus the forty lots of young bulls from six to ten months\r\nold are passed away, averaging from 33 to 44 guineas each.  Besides\r\nthese, from fifty to sixty young bulls, cows and heifers are\r\ndisposed of by private sale during the season, ranging from 50 to\r\n150 guineas, going to buyers from all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is Mr. Cruickshank's well-matured opinion, resulting from long\r\nexperience and observation, that there is no breed of cattle so\r\neasily maintained in good condition as the Shorthorns.  His are fed\r\non pasture grass from the 1st of May to the middle of October, lying\r\nin the open field night and day.  In the winter they are fed\r\n_entirely on oat-straw and turnips_.  Not a handful of hay or of\r\nmeal is given them.  The calves are allowed to suck their dams at\r\npleasure.  He is convinced that with this simple system of feeding,\r\ntogether with the bracing air of Aberdeenshire, he has obtained a\r\ntribe of animals of hardy and robust constitutions, of early\r\nmaturity, well calculated to improve the general stock of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt was to me a delight to see this, the greatest herd of Shorthorns\r\nin the world, numbering animals of apparently the highest perfection\r\nto which they could attain under human treatment.  What a court and\r\ncoterie of \"princes,\" \"dukes,\" \"knights\" and \"ladies\" those stables\r\ncontained--creatures that would not have dishonored higher names by\r\nwearing them!  I was pleased to find that Republics and their less\r\npretentious titles were not excluded from the goodly fellowship of\r\nthis short-horned aristocracy.  There was one grand and noble bull\r\ncalled \"President Lincoln,\" not only, I fancy, out of respect to\r\n\"Honest Old Abe,\" but also in reference to the disposition and\r\ncapacities of the animal.  Truly, if let loose in some of our New\r\nEngland fields, he would prove himself a tremendous \"railsplitter.\"\r\n\r\nAfter spending a quiet Sabbath with this old friend and host at his\r\nfarm-house at Sittyton, I took the train for Edinburgh and had a\r\nweek of the liveliest enjoyment in that city, attending the meetings\r\nof the Social Science Congress.  There I saw and heard for the first\r\ntime the venerable Lord Brougham, also men and women of less\r\nreputation, but of equal heart and will to serve their kind and\r\ncountry.  I had intended to make a separate chapter on these\r\nmeetings and another on the re-unions of the British Association at\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, but the space to which this volume must be\r\nlimited precludes any notice of these most interesting and important\r\ngatherings.  Stopping at different points on the way, I reached\r\nLondon about the middle of October, having occupied just four months\r\nin my northern tour; bringing back a heartful of sunny memories of\r\nwhat I had seen and enjoyed.",
