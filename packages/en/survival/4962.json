CONN\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY AT WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF EVOLUTION OF TO-DAY,\r\nTHE LIVING WORLD, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of this book was published the popular\r\nidea of bacteria to which attention was drawn in the original\r\npreface has undergone considerable modification. Experimental\r\nmedicine has added constantly to the list of diseases caused by\r\nbacterial organisms, and the general public has been educated to\r\nan adequate conception of the importance of the germ as the chief\r\nagency in the transmission of disease, with corresponding\r\nadvantage to the efficiency of personal and public hygiene. At the\r\nsame time knowledge of the benign bacteria and the enormous role\r\nthey play in the industries and the arts has become much more\r\nwidely diffused. Bacteriology is being studied in colleges as one\r\nof the cultural sciences; it is being widely adopted as a subject\r\nof instruction in high schools; and schools of agriculture and\r\nhousehold science turn out each year thousands of graduates\r\nfamiliar with the functions of bacteria in daily life. Through\r\nthese agencies the popular misconception of the nature of micro-\r\norganisms and their relations to man is being gradually displaced\r\nby a general appreciation of their manifold services. It is not\r\nunreasonable to hope that the many thousands of copies of this\r\nlittle manual which have been circulated and read have contributed\r\nmaterially to that end. If its popularity is a safe criterion, the\r\nbook has amply fulfilled its purpose of placing before the general\r\nreader in a simple and direct style the main facts of\r\nbacteriology. Beginning with a discussion of the nature of\r\nbacteria, it shows their position in the scale of plant and animal\r\nlife. The middle chapters describe the functions of bacteria in\r\nthe arts, in the dairy, and in agriculture. The final chapters\r\ndiscuss the relation of bacteria to disease and the methods by\r\nwhich the new and growing science of preventive medicine combats\r\nand counteracts their dangerous powers.\r\n\r\nJULY, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--BACTERIA AS PLANTS\r\n\r\nHistorical.--Form of bacteria.--Multiplication of bacteria.--Spore\r\nformation.--Motion.--Internal structure.--Animals or plants?--\r\nClassification.--Variation.--Where bacteria are found.\r\n\r\nII.--MISCELLANEOUS USES OF BACTERIA IN THE ARTS.\r\n\r\nMaceration industries.--Linen.--Jute.--Hemp.--Sponges.--Leather.\r\n--Fermentative industries.--Vinegar--Lactic acid.--Butyric acid.--\r\nBacteria in tobacco curing.--Troublesome fermentations.\r\n\r\nIII.--BACTERIA IN THE DAIRY.\r\n\r\nSources of bacteria in milk.--Effect of bacteria on milk.--\r\nBacteria used in butter making.--Bacteria in cheese making.\r\n\r\nIV.--BACTERIA IN NATURAL PROCESSES.\r\n\r\nBacteria as scavengers.--Bacteria as agents in Nature's food\r\ncycle.--Relation of bacteria to agriculture.--Sprouting of seeds.\r\n--The silo.--The fertility of the soil.--Bacteria as sources of\r\ntrouble to the farmer.--Coal formation.\r\n\r\nV.--PARASITIC BACTERIA AND THEIR RELATION TO DISEASE\r\n\r\nMethod of producing disease.--Pathogenic germs not strictly\r\nparasitic.--Pathogenic germs that are true parasites.--What\r\ndiseases are due to bacteria.--Variability of pathogenic powers.--\r\nSusceptibility of the individual.--Recovery from bacteriological\r\ndiseases.--Diseases caused by organisms other than bacteria.\r\n\r\nVI.--METHODS OF COMBATING PARASITIC BACTERIA\r\n\r\nPreventive medicine.--Bacteria in surgery.--Prevention by\r\ninoculation.--Limits of preventive medicine.--Curative medicine.\r\n--Drugs--Vis medicatrix naturae.--Antitoxines and their use.--\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF GERM LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA AS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifteen years the subject of bacteriology\r\n[Footnote: The term microbe is simply a word which has been coined\r\nto include all of the microscopic plants commonly included under\r\nthe terms bacteria and yeasts.] has developed with a marvellous\r\nrapidity. At the beginning of the ninth decade of the century\r\nbacteria were scarcely heard of outside of scientific circles, and\r\nvery little was known about them even among scientists. Today they\r\nare almost household words, and everyone who reads is beginning to\r\nrecognise that they have important relations to his everyday life.\r\nThe organisms called bacteria comprise simply a small class of low\r\nplants, but this small group has proved to be of such vast\r\nimportance in its relation to the world in general that its study\r\nhas little by little crystallized into a science by itself. It is\r\na somewhat anomalous fact that a special branch of science,\r\ninteresting such a large number of people, should be developed\r\naround a small group of low plants. The importance of bacteriology\r\nis not due to any importance bacteria have as plants or as members\r\nof the vegetable kingdom, but solely to their powers of producing\r\nprofound changes in Nature. There is no one family of plants that\r\nbegins to compare with them in importance. It is the object of\r\nthis work to point out briefly how much both of good and ill we\r\nowe to the life and growth of these microscopic organisms. As we\r\nhave learned more and more of them during the last fifty years, it\r\nhas become more and more evident that this one little class of\r\nmicroscopic plants fills a place in Nature's processes which in\r\nsome respects balances that filled by the whole of the green\r\nplants. Minute as they are, their importance can hardly be\r\noverrated, for upon their activities is founded the continued life\r\nof the animal and vegetable kingdom. For good and for ill they are\r\nagents of neverceasing and almost unlimited powers.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL.\r\n\r\nThe study of bacteria practically began with the use of the\r\nmicroscope. It was toward the close of the seventeenth century\r\nthat the Dutch microscopist, Leeuwenhoek, working with his simple\r\nlenses, first saw the organisms which we now know under this name,\r\nwith sufficient clearness to describe them. Beyond mentioning\r\ntheir existence, however, his observations told little or nothing.\r\nNor can much more be said of the studies which followed during the\r\nnext one hundred and fifty years. During this long period many a\r\nmicroscope was turned to the observation of these minute\r\norganisms, but the majority of observers were contented with\r\nsimply seeing them, marvelling at their minuteness, and uttering\r\nmany exclamations of astonishment at the wonders of Nature. A few\r\nmen of more strictly scientific natures paid some attention to\r\nthese little organisms. Among them we should perhaps mention Von\r\nGleichen, Muller, Spallanzani, and Needham. Each of these, as well\r\nas others, made some contributions to our knowledge of\r\nmicroscopical life, and among other organisms studied those which\r\nwe now call bacteria. Speculations were even made at these early\r\ndates of the possible causal connection of these organisms with\r\ndiseases, and for a little the medical profession was interested\r\nin the suggestion. It was impossible then, however, to obtain any\r\nevidence for the truth of this speculation, and it was abandoned\r\nas unfounded, and even forgotten completely, until revived again\r\nabout the middle of the 19th century. During this century of\r\nwonder a sufficiency of exactness was, however, introduced into\r\nthe study of microscopic organisms to call for the use of names,\r\nand we find Muller using the names of Monas, Proteus, Vibrio,\r\nBacillus, and Spirillum, names which still continue in use,\r\nalthough commonly with a different significance from that given\r\nthem by Muller. Muller did indeed make a study sufficient to\r\nrecognise the several distinct types, and attempted to classsify\r\nthese bodies. They were not regarded as of much importance, but\r\nsimply as the most minute organisms known.\r\n\r\nNothing of importance came from this work, however, partly because\r\nof the inadequacy of the microscopes of the day, and partly\r\nbecause of a failure to understand the real problems at issue.\r\nWhen we remember the minuteness of the bacteria, the impossibility\r\nof studying any one of them for more than a few moments at a time\r\n--only so long, in fact, as it can be followed under a microscope;\r\nwhen we remember, too, the imperfection of the compound\r\nmicroscopes which made high powers practical impossibilities; and,\r\nabove all, when we appreciate the looseness of the ideas which\r\npervaded all scientists as to the necessity of accurate\r\nobservation in distinction from inference, it is not strange that\r\nthe last century gave us no knowledge of bacteria beyond the mere\r\nfact of the existence of some extremely minute organisms in\r\ndifferent decaying materials. Nor did the 19th century add much to\r\nthis until toward its middle. It is true that the microscope was\r\nvastly improved early in the century, and since this improvement\r\nserved as a decided stimulus to the study of microscopic life,\r\namong other organisms studied, bacteria received some attention.\r\nEhrenberg, Dujardin, Fuchs, Perty, and others left the impress of\r\ntheir work upon bacteriology even before the middle of the\r\ncentury. It is true that Schwann shrewdly drew conclusions as to\r\nthe relation of microscopic organisms to various processes of\r\nfermentation and decay--conclusions which, although not accepted\r\nat the time, have subsequently proved to be correct. It is true\r\nthat Fuchs made a careful study of the infection of \"blue milk,\"\r\nreaching the correct conclusion that the infection was caused by a\r\nmicroscopic organism which he discovered and carefully studied. It\r\nis true that Henle made a general theory as to the relation of\r\nsuch organisms to diseases, and pointed out the logically\r\nnecessary steps in a demonstration of the causal connection\r\nbetween any organism and a disease. It is true also that a general\r\ntheory of the production of ail kinds of fermentation by living\r\norganisms had been advanced. But all these suggestions made little\r\nimpression. On the one hand, bacteria were not recognised as a\r\nclass of organisms by themselves--were not, indeed, distinguished\r\nfrom yeasts or other minute animalcuise. Their variety was not\r\nmistrusted and their significance not conceived. As microscopic\r\norganisms, there were no reasons for considering them of any more\r\nimportance than any other small animals or plants, and their\r\nextreme minuteness and simplicity made them of little interest to\r\nthe microscopist. On the other hand, their causal connection with\r\nfermentative and putrefactive processes was entirely obscured by\r\nthe overshadowing weight of the chemist Liebig, who believed that\r\nfermentations and putrefactions were simply chemical processes.\r\nLiebig insisted that all albuminoid bodies were in a state of\r\nchemically unstable equilibrium, and if left to themselves would\r\nfall to pieces without any need of the action of microscopic\r\norganisms. The force of Liebig's authority and the brilliancy of\r\nhis expositions led to the wide acceptance of his views and the\r\ntemporary obscurity of the relation of microscopic organisms to\r\nfermentative and putrefactive processes. The objections to\r\nLiebig's views were hardly noticed, and the force of the\r\nexperiments of Schwann was silently ignored. Until the sixth\r\ndecade of the century, therefore, these organisms, which have\r\nsince become the basis of a new branch of science, had hardly\r\nemerged from obscurity. A few microscopists recognised their\r\nexistence, just as they did any other group of small animals or\r\nplants, but even yet they failed to look upon them as forming a\r\ndistinct group. A growing number of observations was accumulating,\r\npointing toward a probable causal connection between fermentative\r\nand putrefactive processes and the growth of microscopic\r\norganisms; but these observations were known only to a few, and\r\nwere ignored by the majority of scientists.\r\n\r\nIt was Louis Pasteur who brought bacteria to the front, and it was\r\nby his labours that these organisms were rescued from the\r\nobscurity of scientific publications and made objects of general\r\nand crowning interest. It was Pasteur who first successfully\r\ncombated the chemical theory of fermentation by showing that\r\nalbuminous matter had no inherent tendency to decomposition. It\r\nwas Pasteur who first clearly demonstrated that these little\r\nbodies, like all larger animals and plants, come into existence\r\nonly by ordinary methods of reproduction, and not by any\r\nspontaneous generation, as had been earlier claimed. It was\r\nPasteur who first proved that such a common phenomenon as. the\r\nsouring of milk was produced by microscopic organisms growing in\r\nthe milk. It was Pasteur who first succeeded in demonstrating that\r\ncertain species of microscopic organisms are the cause of certain\r\ndiseases, and in suggesting successful methods of avoiding them.\r\nAll these discoveries were made in rapid succession. Within ten\r\nyears of the time that his name began to be heard in this\r\nconnection by scientists, the subject had advanced so rapidly that\r\nit had become evident that here was a new subject of importance to\r\nthe scientific world, if not to the public at large. The other\r\nimportant discoveries which Pasteur made it is not our purpose to\r\nmention here. His claim to be considered the founder of\r\nbacteriology will be recognised from what has already been\r\nmentioned. It was not that he first discovered the organisms, or\r\nfirst studied them; it was not that he first suggested their\r\ncausal connection with fermentation and disease, but it was\r\nbecause he for the first time placed the subject upon a firm\r\nfoundation by proving with rigid experiment some of the\r\nsuggestions made by others, and in this way turned the attention\r\nof science to the study of micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nAfter the importance of the subject had been demonstrated by\r\nPasteur, others turned their attention in the same direction,\r\neither for the purpose of verification or refutation of Pasteur's\r\nviews. The advance was not very rapid, however, since\r\nbacteriological experimentation proved to be a subject of\r\nextraordinary difficulty. Bacteria were not even yet recognised as\r\na group of organisms distinct enough to be grouped by themselves,\r\nbut were even by Pasteur at first confounded with yeasts. As a\r\ndistinct group of organisms they were first distinguished by\r\nHoffman in 1869, since which date the term bacteria, as applying\r\nto this special group of organisms, has been coming more and more\r\ninto use. So difficult were the investigations, that for years\r\nthere were hardly any investigators besides Pasteur who could\r\nsuccessfully handle the subject and reach conclusions which could\r\nstand the test of time. For the next thirty years, although\r\ninvestigators and investigations continued to increase, we can\r\nfind little besides dispute and confusion along this line. The\r\ndifficulty of obtaining for experiment any one kind of bacteria by\r\nitself, unmixed with others (pure cultures), rendered advance\r\nalmost impossible. So conflicting were the results that the whole\r\nsubject soon came into almost hopeless confusion, and very few\r\nsteps were taken upon any sure basis. So difficult were the\r\nmethods, so contradictory and confusing the results, because of\r\nimpure cultures, that a student of to-day who wishes to look up\r\nthe previous discoveries in almost any line of bacteriology need\r\nhardly go back of 1880, since he can almost rest assured that\r\nanything done earlier than that was more likely to be erroneous\r\nthan correct.\r\n\r\nThe last fifteen years have, however, seen a wonderful change. The\r\ndifficulties had been mostly those of methods of work, and with\r\nthe ninth decade of the century these methods were simplified by\r\nRobert Koch. This simplification of method for the first time\r\nplaced this line of investigation within the reach of scientists\r\nwho did not have the genius of Pasteur. It was now possible to get\r\npure cultures easily, and to obtain with such pure cultures\r\nresults which were uniform and simple. It was now possible to take\r\nsteps which had the stamp of accuracy upon them, and which further\r\nexperiment did not disprove. From the time when these methods were\r\nthus made manageable the study of bacteria increased with a\r\nrapidity which has been fairly startling, and the information\r\nwhich has accumulated is almost formidable. The very rapidity with\r\nwhich the investigations have progressed has brought considerable\r\nconfusion, from the fact that the new discoveries have not had\r\ntime to be properly assimilated into knowledge. Today many facts\r\nare known whose significance is still uncertain, and a clear\r\nlogical discussion of the facts of modern bacteriology is not\r\npossible. But sufficient knowledge has been accumulated and\r\ndigested to show us at least the direction along which\r\nbacteriological advance is tending, and it is to the pointing out\r\nof these directions that the following pages will be devoted.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE BACTERIA?\r\n\r\nThe most interesting facts connected with the subject of\r\nbacteriology concern the powers and influence in Nature possessed\r\nby the bacteria. The morphological side of the subject is\r\ninteresting enough to the scientist, but to him alone. Still, it\r\nis impossible to attempt to study the powers of bacteria without\r\nknowing something of the organisms themselves. To understand how\r\nthey come to play an important part in Nature's processes, we must\r\nknow first how they look and where they are found. A short\r\nconsideration of certain morphological facts will therefore be\r\nnecessary at the start.\r\n\r\nFORM OF BACTERIA.\r\n\r\nIn shape bacteria are the simplest conceivable structures.\r\nAlthough there are hundreds of different species, they have only\r\nthree general forms, which have been aptly compared to billiard\r\nballs, lead pencils, and corkscrews. Spheres, rods, and spirals\r\nrepresent all shapes. The spheres may be large or small, and may\r\ngroup themselves in various ways; the rods may be long or short,\r\nthick or slender; the spirals may be loosely or tightly coiled,\r\nand may have only one or two or may have many coils, and they may\r\nbe flexible or stiff; but still rods, spheres, and spirals\r\ncomprise all types.\r\n\r\nIn size there is some variation, though not very great. All are\r\nextremely minute, and never visible to the naked eye. The spheres\r\nvary from 0.25 u to 1.5 u (0.000012 to 0.00006 inches). The rods\r\nmay be no more than 0.3 u in diameter, or may be as wide as 1.5 u\r\nto 2.5 u, and in length vary all the way from a length scarcely\r\nlonger than their diameter to long threads. About the same may be\r\nsaid of the spiral forms. They are decidedly the smallest living\r\norganisms which our microscopes have revealed.\r\n\r\nIn their method of growth we find one of the most characteristic\r\nfeatures. They universally have the power of multiplication by\r\nsimple division or fission. Each individual elongates and then\r\ndivides in the middle into two similar halves, each of which then\r\nrepeats the process. This method of multiplication by simple\r\ndivision is the distinguishing mark which separates the bacteria\r\nfrom the yeasts, the latter plants multiplying by a process known\r\nas budding. Fig. 2 shows these two methods of multiplication.\r\n\r\nWhile all bacteria thus multiply by division, certain differences\r\nin the details produce rather striking differences in the results.\r\nConsidering first the spherical forms, we find that some species\r\ndivide, as described, into two, which separate at once, and each\r\nof which in turn divides in the opposite direction, called\r\nMicrococcus, (Fig. 3). Other species divide only in one direction.\r\nFrequently they do not separate after dividing, but remain\r\nattached. Each, however, again elongates and divides again, but\r\nall still remain attached. There are thus formed long chains of\r\nspheres like strings of beads, called Streptococci (Fig. 4). Other\r\nspecies divide first in one direction, then at right angles to the\r\nfirst division, and a third division follows at right angles to\r\nthe plane of the first two, thus producing solid groups of fours,\r\neights, or sixteens (Fig 5), called Sarcina. Each different\r\nspecies of bacteria is uniform in its method of division, and\r\nthese differences are therefore indications of differences in\r\nspecies, or, according to our present method of classification,\r\nthe different methods of division represent different genera. All\r\nbacteria producing Streptococcus chains form a single genus\r\nStreptococcus, and all which divide in three division planes form\r\nanother genus, Sarcina, etc.\r\n\r\nThe rod-shaped bacteria also differ somewhat, but to a less\r\nextent. They almost always divide in a plane at right angles to\r\ntheir longest dimension. But here again we find some species\r\nseparating immediately after division, and thus always appearing\r\nas short rods (Fig. 6), while others remain attached after\r\ndivision and form long chains. Sometimes they appear to continue\r\nto increase in length without showing any signs of division, and\r\nin this way long threads are formed (Fig. 7). These threads are,\r\nhowever, potentially at least, long chains of short rods, and\r\nunder proper conditions they will break up into such short rods,\r\nas shown in Fig. 7a. Occasionally a rod species may divide\r\nlengthwise, but this is rare. Exactly the same may be said of the\r\nspiral forms. Here, too, we find short rods and long chains, or\r\nlong spiral filaments in which can be seen no division into\r\nshorter elements, but which, under certain conditions, break up\r\ninto short sections.\r\n\r\nRAPIDITY OF MULTIPLICATION.\r\n\r\nIt is this power of multiplication by division that makes bacteria\r\nagents of such significance. Their minute size would make them\r\nharmless enough if it were not for an extraordinary power of\r\nmultiplication. This power of growth and division is almost\r\nincredible. Some of the species which have been carefully watched\r\nunder the microscope have been found under favourable conditions\r\nto grow so rapidly as to divide every half hour, or even less. The\r\nnumber of offspring that would result in the course of twenty-four\r\nhours at this rate is of course easily computed. In one day each\r\nbacterium would produce over 16,500,000 descendants, and in two\r\ndays about 281,500,000,000. It has been further calculated that\r\nthese 281,500,000,000 would form about a solid pint of bacteria\r\nand weigh about a pound. At the end of the third day the total\r\ndescendants would amount to 47,000,000,000,000, and would weigh\r\nabout 16,000,000 pounds. Of course these numbers have no\r\nsignificance, for they are never actual or even possible numbers.\r\nLong before the offspring reach even into the millions their rate\r\nof multiplication is checked either by lack of food or by the\r\naccumulation of their own excreted products, which are injurious\r\nto them. But the figures do have interest since they show faintly\r\nwhat an unlimited power of multiplication these organisms have,\r\nand thus show us that in dealing with bacteria we are dealing with\r\nforces of almost infinite extent.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful power of growth is chiefly due to the fact that\r\nbacteria feed upon food which is highly organized and already in\r\ncondition for absorption. Most plants must manufacture their own\r\nfoods out of simpler substances, like carbonic dioxide (Co2) and\r\nwater, but bacteria, as a rule, feed upon complex organic material\r\nalready prepared by the previous life of plants or animals. For\r\nthis reason they can grow faster than other plants. Not being\r\nobliged to make their own foods like most plants, nor to search\r\nfor it like animals, but living in its midst, their rapidity of\r\ngrowth and multiplication is limited only by their power to seize\r\nand assimilate this food. As they grow in such masses of food,\r\nthey cause certain chemical changes to take place in it, changes\r\ndoubtless directly connected with their use of the material as\r\nfood. Recognising that they do cause chemical changes in food\r\nmaterial, and remembering this marvellous power of growth, we are\r\nprepared to believe them capable of producing changes wherever\r\nthey get a foothold and begin to grow. Their power of feeding upon\r\ncomplex organic food and producing chemical changes therein,\r\ntogether with their marvellous power of assimilating this material\r\nas food, make them agents in Nature of extreme importance.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BACTERIA.\r\n\r\nWhile bacteria are thus very simple in form, there are a few other\r\nslight variations in detail which assist in distinguishing them.\r\nThe rods are sometimes very blunt at the ends, almost as if cut\r\nsquare across, while in other species they are more rounded and\r\noccasionally slightly tapering. Sometimes they are\r\nsurrounded by a thin layer of some gelatinous substance, which\r\nforms what is called a capsule (Fig. 10). This capsule may connect\r\nthem and serve as a cement, to prevent the separate elements of a\r\nchain from falling apart.\r\n\r\nSometimes such a gelatinous secretion will unite great masses of\r\nbacteria into clusters, which may float on the surface of the\r\nliquid in which they grow or may sink to the bottom. Such masses\r\nare called zoogloea, and their general appearance serves as one of\r\nthe characters for distinguishing different species of bacteria\r\n(Fig. 10, a and b). When growing in solid media, such as a\r\nnutritious liquid made stiff with gelatine, the different species\r\nhave different methods of spreading from their central point of\r\norigin. A single bacterium in the midst of such a stiffened mass\r\nwill feed upon it and produce descendants rapidly; but these\r\ndescendants, not being able to move through the gelatine, will\r\nremain clustered together in a mass, which the bacteriologist\r\ncalls a colony. But their method of clustering, due to different\r\nmethods of growth, is by no means always alike, and these colonies\r\nshow great differences in general appearance. The differences\r\nappear to be constant, however, for the same species of bacteria,\r\nand hence the shape and appearance of the colony enable\r\nbacteriologists to discern different species (Fig. II). All these\r\npoints of difference are of practical use to the bacteriologist in\r\ndistinguishing species.\r\n\r\nSPORE FORMATION.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their power of reproduction by simple division,\r\nmany species of bacteria have a second method by means of spores.\r\nSpores are special rounded or oval bits of bacteria protoplasm\r\ncapable of resisting adverse conditions which would destroy the\r\nordinary bacteria. They arise among bacteria in two different\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nEndogenous spores.--These spores arise inside of the rods or the\r\nspiral forms (Fig. 12). They first appear as slight granular\r\nmasses, or as dark points which become gradually distinct from the\r\nrest of the rod. Eventually there is thus formed inside the rod a\r\nclear, highly refractive, spherical or oval spore, which may even\r\nbe of a greater diameter than the rod producing it, thus causing\r\nit to swell out and become spindle formed [Fig. 12 c]. These\r\nspores may form in the middle or at the ends of the rods (Fig.\r\n12). They may use up all the protoplasm of the rod in their\r\nformation, or they may use only a small part of it, the rod which\r\nforms them continuing its activities in spite of the formation of\r\nthe spores within it. They are always clear and highly refractive\r\nfrom containing little water, and they do not so readily absorb\r\nstaining material as the ordinary rods. They appear to be covered\r\nwith a layer of some substance which resists the stain, and which\r\nalso enables them to resist various external agencies. This\r\nprotective covering, together with their small amount of water,\r\nenables them to resist almost any amount of drying, a high degree\r\nof heat, and many other adverse conditions. Commonly the spores\r\nbreak out of the rod, and the rod producing them dies, although\r\nsometimes the rod may continue its activity even after the spores\r\nhave been produced.\r\n\r\nArthrogenous spores (?).--Certain species of bacteria do not\r\nproduce spores as just described, but may give rise to bodies that\r\nare sometimes called arthrospores. These bodies are formed as\r\nshort segments of rods. A long rod may sometimes break up into\r\nseveral short rounded elements, which are clear and appear to have\r\na somewhat increased power of resisting adverse conditions. The\r\nsame may happen among the spherical forms, which only in rare\r\ninstances form endogenous spores. Among the spheres which form a\r\nchain of streptococci some may occasionally be slightly different\r\nfrom the rest. They are a little larger, and have been thought to\r\nhave an increased resisting power like that of true spores (Fig.\r\n13 b). It is quite doubtful, however, whether it is proper to\r\nregard these bodies as spores. There is no good evidence that they\r\nhave any special resisting power to heat like endogenous spores,\r\nand bacteriologists in general are inclined to regard them simply\r\nas resting cells. The term arthrospores has been given to them to\r\nindicate that they are formed as joints or segments, and this term\r\nmay be a convenient one to retain although the bodies in question\r\nare not true spores.\r\n\r\nStill a different method of spore formation occurs in a few\r\npeculiar bacteria. In this case (Fig. 14) the protoplasm in the\r\nlarge thread breaks into many minute spherical bodies, which\r\nfinally find exit. The spores thus formed may not be all alike,\r\ndifferences in size being noticed. This method of spore formation\r\noccurs only in a few special forms of bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe matter of spore formation serves as one of the points for\r\ndistinguishing species. Some species do not form spores, at least\r\nunder any of the conditions in which they have been studied.\r\nOthers form them readily in almost any condition, and others again\r\nonly under special conditions which are adverse to their life. The\r\nmethod of spore formation is always uniform for any single\r\nspecies. Whatever be the method of the formation of the spore, its\r\npurpose in the life of the bacterium is always the same. It serves\r\nas a means of keeping the species alive under conditions of\r\nadversity. Its power of resisting heat or drying enables it to\r\nlive where the ordinary active forms would be speedily killed.\r\nSome of these spores are capable of resisting a heat of 180\r\ndegrees C. (360 degrees F.) for a short time, and boiling water\r\nthey can resist for a long time. Such spores when subsequently\r\nplaced under favourable conditions will germinate and start\r\nbacterial activity anew.\r\n\r\nMOTION.\r\n\r\nSome species of bacteria have the power of active motion, and may\r\nbe seen darting rapidly to and fro in the liquid in which they are\r\ngrowing. This motion is produced by flagella which protrude from\r\nthe body. These flagella (Fig. 15) arise from a membrane\r\nsurrounding the bacterium, but have an intimate connection with\r\nthe protoplasmic content. Their distribution is different in\r\ndifferent species of bacteria. Some species have a single\r\nflagellum at one end (Fig. 15 a). Others have one at each end\r\n(Fig. 15 b). Others, again, have, at least just before dividing, a\r\nbunch at one or both ends (Fig. 15 c and d), while others, again,\r\nhave many flagella distributed all over the body in dense\r\nprofusion (Fig. 15 e). These flagella keep up a lashing to and fro\r\nin the liquid, and the lashing serves to propel the bacteria\r\nthrough the liquid.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL STRUCTURE.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to say much about the structure of the\r\nbacteria beyond the description of their external forms. With all\r\nthe variations in detail mentioned, they are extraordinarily\r\nsimple, and about all that can be seen is their external shape. Of\r\ncourse, they have some internal structure, but we know very little\r\nin regard to it. Some microscopists have described certain\r\nappearances which they think indicate internal structure. Fig. 16\r\nshows some of these appearances. The matter is as yet very\r\nobscure, however. The bacteria appear to have a membranous\r\ncovering which sometimes is of a cellulose nature. Within it is\r\nprotoplasm which shows various uncertain appearances. Some\r\nmicroscopists have thought they could find a nucleus, and have\r\nregarded bacteria as cells with inclosed nucleii (Figs. 10 a and\r\n15 f). Others have regarded the whole bacterium as a nucleus\r\nwithout any protoplasm, while others, again, have concluded that\r\nthe discerned internal structure is nothing except an appearance\r\npresented by the physical arrangement of the protoplasm. While we\r\nmay believe that they have some internal structure, we must\r\nrecognise that as yet microscopists have not been able to make it\r\nout. In short, the bacteria after two centuries of study appear to\r\nus about as they did at first. They must still be described as\r\nminute spheres, rods, or spirals, with no further discernible\r\nstructure, sometimes motile and sometimes stationary, sometimes\r\nproducing spores and sometimes not, and multiplying universally by\r\nbinary fission. With all the development of the modern microscope\r\nwe can hardly say more than this. Our advance in knowledge of\r\nbacteria is connected almost wholly with their methods of growth\r\nand the effects they produce in Nature.\r\n\r\nANIMALS OR PLANTS?\r\n\r\nThere has been in the past not a little question as to whether\r\nbacteria should be rightly classed with plants or with animals.\r\nThey certainly have characters which ally them with both. Their\r\nvery common power of active independent motion and their common\r\nhabit of living upon complex bodies for foods are animal\r\ncharacters, and have lent force to the suggestion that they are\r\ntrue animals. But their general form, their method of growth and\r\nformation of threads, and their method of spore formation are\r\nquite plantlike. Their general form is very similar to a group of\r\nlow green plants known as Oscillaria. Fig. 17 shows a group of\r\nthese Oscillariae, and the similarity of this to some of the\r\nthread-like bacteria is decided. The Oscillariae are, however,\r\ntrue plants, and are of a green colour. Bacteria are therefore to-\r\nday looked upon as a low type of plant which has no chlorophyll,\r\n[Footnote: Chlorophyll is the green colouring matter of plants.]\r\nbut is related to Oscillariae. The absence of the chlorophyll has\r\nforced them to adopt new relations to food, and compels them to\r\nfeed upon complex foods instead of the simple ones, which form the\r\nfood of green plants. We may have no hesitation, then, in calling\r\nthem plants. It is interesting to notice that with this idea their\r\nplace in the organic world is reduced to a small one\r\nsystematically. They do not form a class by themselves, but are\r\nsimply a subclass, or even a family, and a family closely related\r\nto several other common plants. But the absence of chlorophyll and\r\nthe resulting peculiar life has brought about a curious anomaly.\r\nWhereas their closest allies are known only to botanists, and are\r\nof no interest outside of their systematic relations, the bacteria\r\nare familiar to every one, and are demanding the life attention of\r\nhundreds of investigators. It is their absence of chlorophyll and\r\ntheir consequent dependence upon complex foods which has produced\r\nthis anomaly.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF BACTERIA.\r\n\r\nWhile it has generally been recognised that bacteria are plants,\r\nany further classification has proved a matter of great\r\ndifficulty, and bacteriologists find it extremely difficult to\r\ndevise means of distinguishing species. Their extreme simplicity\r\nmakes it no easy matter to find points by which any species can be\r\nrecognised. But in spite of their similarity, there is no doubt\r\nthat many different species exist. Bacteria which appear to be\r\nalmost identical, under the microscope prove to have entirely\r\ndifferent properties, and must therefore be regarded as distinct\r\nspecies. But how to distinguish them has been a puzzle.\r\nMicroscopists have come to look upon the differences in shape,\r\nmultiplication, and formation of spores as furnishing data\r\nsufficient to enable them to divide the bacteria into genera. The\r\ngenus Bacillus, for instance, is the name given to all rod-shaped\r\nbacteria which form endogenous spores, etc. But to distinguish\r\nsmaller subdivisions it has been found necessary to fall back upon\r\nother characters, such as the shape of the colony produced in\r\nsolid gelatine, the power to produce disease, or to oxidize\r\nnitrites, etc. Thus at present the different species are\r\ndistinguished rather by their physiological than their\r\nmorphological characters. This is an unsatisfactory basis of\r\nclassification, and has produced much confusion in the attempts to\r\nclassify bacteria. The problem of determining the species of\r\nbacteria is to-day a very difficult one, and with our best methods\r\nis still unsatisfactorily solved. A few species of marked\r\ncharacter are well known, and their powers of action so well\r\nunderstood that they can be readily recognised; but of the great\r\nhost of bacteria studied, the large majority have been so slightly\r\nexperimented upon that their characters are not known, and it is\r\nimpossible, therefore, to distinguish many of them apart. We find\r\nthat each bacteriologist working in any special line commonly\r\nkeeps a list of the bacteria which he finds, with such data in\r\nregard to them as he has collected. Such a list is of value to\r\nhim, but commonly of little value to other bacteriologists from\r\nthe insufficiency of the data. Thus it happens that a large part\r\nof the different species of bacteria described in literature to-\r\nday have been found and studied by one investigator alone. By him\r\nthey have been described and perhaps named. Quite likely the same\r\nspecies may have been found by two or three other bacteriologists,\r\nbut owing to the difficulty of comparing results and the\r\nincompleteness of the descriptions the identity of the species is\r\nnot discovered, and they are probably described again under\r\ndifferent names. The same process may be repeated over and over\r\nagain, until the same species of bacterium will come to be known\r\nby several different names, as it has been studied by different\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nVARIATION OF BACTERIA.\r\n\r\nThis matter is made even more confusing by the fact that any\r\nspecies of bacterium may show more or less variation. At one time\r\nin the history of bacteriology, a period lasting for many years,\r\nit was the prevalent opinion that there was no constancy among\r\nbacteria, but that the same species might assume almost any of the\r\nvarious forms and shapes, and possess various properties. Bacteria\r\nwere regarded by some as stages in the life history of higher\r\nplants. This question as to whether bacteria remain constant in\r\ncharacter for any considerable length of time has ever been a\r\nprominent one with bacteriologists, and even to-day we hardly know\r\nwhat the final answer will be. It has been demonstrated beyond\r\nperadventure that some species may change their physiological\r\ncharacters. Disease bacteria, for instance, under certain\r\nconditions lose their powers of developing disease. Species which\r\nsour milk, or others which turn gelatine green, may lose their\r\ncharacters. Now, since it is upon just such physiological\r\ncharacters as these that we must depend in order to separate\r\ndifferent species of bacteria from each other, it will be seen\r\nthat great confusion and uncertainty will result in our attempts\r\nto define species. Further, it has been proved that there is\r\nsometimes more or less of a metamorphosis in the life history of\r\ncertain species of bacteria. The same species may form a short\r\nrod, or a long thread, or break up into spherical spores, and thus\r\neither a short rod, or a thread, or a spherical form may belong to\r\nthe same species. Other species may be motile at one time and\r\nstationary at another, while at a third period it is a simple mass\r\nof spherical spores. A spherical form, when it lengthens before\r\ndividing, appears as a short rod, and a short rod form after\r\ndividing may be so short as to appear like a spherical organism.\r\n\r\nWith all these reasons for confusion, it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat no satisfactory classification of bacteria has been reached,\r\nor that different bacteriologists do not agree as to what\r\nconstitutes a species, or whether two forms are identical or not.\r\nBut with all the confusion there is slowly being obtained\r\nsomething like system. In spite of the fact that species may vary\r\nand show different properties under different conditions, the\r\nfundamental constancy of species is everywhere recognised to-day\r\nas a fact. The members of the same species may show different\r\nproperties under different conditions, but it is believed that\r\nunder identical conditions the properties will be constant. It is\r\nno more possible to convert one species into another than it is\r\namong the higher orders of plants. It is believed that bacteria do\r\nform a group of plants by themselves, and are not to be regarded\r\nas stages in the history of higher plants. It is believed that,\r\ntogether with a considerable amount of variability and an\r\noccasional somewhat long life history with successive stages,\r\nthere is also an essential constancy. A systematic classification\r\nhas been made which is becoming more or less satisfactory. We are\r\nconstantly learning more and more of the characters, so that they\r\ncan be recognised in different places by different observers. It\r\nis the conviction of all who work with bacteria that, in spite of\r\nthe difficulties, it is only a matter of time when we shall have a\r\nclassification and description of bacteria so complete as to\r\ncharacterize the different species accurately.\r\n\r\nEven with our present incomplete knowledge of what characterizes a\r\nspecies, it is necessary to use some names. Bacteria are commonly\r\ngiven a generic name based upon their microscopic appearance.\r\nThere are only a few of these names. Micrococcus, Streptococcus,\r\nStaphylococcus, Sarcina, Bacterium, Bacillus, Spirillum, are all\r\nthe names in common use applying to the ordinary bacteria. There\r\nare a few others less commonly used. To this generic name a\r\nspecific name is commonly added, based upon some physiological\r\ncharacter. For example, Bacillus typhosus is the name given to the\r\nbacillus which causes typhoid fever. Such names are of great use\r\nwhen the species is a common and well-known one, but of doubtful\r\nvalue for less-known species It frequently happens that a\r\nbacteriologist makes a study of the bacteria found in a certain\r\nlocality, and obtains thus a long list of species hitherto\r\nunknown. In these cases it is common simply to number these\r\nspecies rather than name them. This method is frequently\r\nadvisable, since the bacteriologist can seldom hunt up all\r\nbacteriological literature with sufficient accuracy to determine\r\nwhether some other bacteriologist may not have found the same\r\nspecies in an entirely different locality. One bacteriologist, for\r\nexample, finds some seventy different species of bacteria in\r\ndifferent cheeses. He studies them enough for his own purposes,\r\nbut not sufficiently to determine whether some other person may\r\nnot have found the same species perhaps in milk or water. He\r\ntherefore simply numbers them--a method which conveys no suggestion\r\nas to whether they may be new species or not. This method avoids\r\nthe giving of separate names to the same species found by\r\ndifferent observers, and it is hoped that gradually accumulating\r\nknowledge will in time group together the forms which are really\r\nidentical, but which have been described by different observers.\r\n\r\nWHERE BACTERIA ARE FOUND.\r\n\r\nThere are no other plants or animals so universally found in\r\nNature as the bacteria. It is this universal presence, together\r\nwith their great powers of multiplication, which renders them of\r\nso much importance in Nature. They exist almost everywhere on the\r\nsurface of the earth. They are in the soil, especially at its\r\nsurface. They do not extend to very great depths of soil, however,\r\nfew existing below four feet of soil. At the surface they are very\r\nabundant, especially if the soil is moist and full of organic\r\nmaterial. The number may range from a few hundred to one hundred\r\nmillions per gramme. [Footnote: One gramme is fifteen grains.] The\r\nsoil bacteria vary also in species, some two-score different\r\nspecies having been described as common in soil. They are in all\r\nbodies of water, both at the surface and below it. They are found\r\nat considerable depths in the ocean. All bodies of fresh water\r\ncontain them, and all sediments in such bodies of water are filled\r\nwith bacteria. They are in streams of running water in even\r\ngreater quantity than in standing water. This is simply because\r\nrunning streams are being constantly supplied with water which has\r\nbeen washing the surface of the country and thus carrying off all\r\nsurface accumulations. Lakes or reservoirs, however, by standing\r\nquiet allow the bacteria to settle to the bottom, and the water\r\nthus gets somewhat purified. They are in the air, especially in\r\nregions of habitation. Their numbers are greatest near the surface\r\nof the ground, and decrease in the upper strata of air. Anything\r\nwhich tends to raise dust increases the number of bacteria in the\r\nair greatly, and the dust and emanations from the clothes of\r\npeople crowded in a close room fill the air with bacteria in very\r\ngreat numbers. They are found in excessive abundance in every bit\r\nof decaying matter wherever it may be. Manure heaps, dead bodies\r\nof animals, decaying trees, filth and slime and muck everywhere\r\nare filled with them, for it is in such places that they find\r\ntheir best nourishment. The bodies of animals contain them in the\r\nmouth, stomach, and intestine in great numbers, and this is, of\r\ncourse, equally true of man. On the surface of the body they cling\r\nin great quantity; attached to the clothes, under the finger\r\nnails, among the hairs, in every possible crevice or hiding place\r\nin the skin, and in all secretions. They do not, however, occur in\r\nthe tissues of a healthy individual, either in the blood, muscle,\r\ngland, or any other organ. Secretions, such as milk, urine, etc.,\r\nalways contain them, however, since the bacteria do exist in the\r\nducts of the glands which conduct the secretions to the exterior,\r\nand thus, while the bacteria are never in the healthy gland\r\nitself, they always succeed in contaminating the secretion as it\r\npasses to the exterior. Not only higher animals, but the lower\r\nanimals also have their bodies more or less covered with bacteria.\r\nFlies have them on their feet, bees among their hairs, etc.\r\n\r\nIn short, wherever on the face of Nature there is a lodging place\r\nfor dust there will be found bacteria. In most of these localities\r\nthey are dormant, or at least growing only a little. The bacteria\r\nclinging to the dry hair can grow but little, if at all, and those\r\nin pure water multiply very little. When dried as dust they are\r\nentirely dormant. But each individual bacterium or spore has the\r\npotential power of multiplication already noticed, and as soon as\r\nit by accident falls upon a place where there is food and moisture\r\nit will begin to multiply. Everywhere in Nature, then, exists this\r\ngroup of organisms with its almost inconceivable power of\r\nmultiplication, but a power held in check by lack of food. Furnish\r\nthem with food and their potential powers become actual. Such food\r\nis provided by the dead bodies of animals or plants, or by animal\r\nsecretions, or from various other sources. The bacteria which are\r\nfortunate enough to get furnished with such food material continue\r\nto feed upon it until the food supply is exhausted or their growth\r\nis checked in some other way. They may be regarded, therefore, as\r\na constant and universal power usually held in check. With their\r\nuniversal presence and their powers of producing chemical changes\r\nin food material, they are ever ready to produce changes in the\r\nface of Nature, and to these changes we will now turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS USE OF BACTERIA IN THE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foods upon which bacteria live are in endless variety, almost\r\nevery product of animal or vegetable life serving to supply their\r\nneeds. Some species appear to require somewhat definite kinds of\r\nfood, and have therefore rather narrow conditions of life, but the\r\nmajority may live upon a great variety of organic compounds. As\r\nthey consume the material which serves them as food they produce\r\nchemical changes therein. These changes are largely of a nature\r\nthat the chemist knows as decomposition changes. By this is meant\r\nthat the bacteria, seizing hold of ingredients which constitute\r\ntheir food, break them to pieces chemically. The molecule of the\r\noriginal food matter is split into simpler molecules, and the food\r\nis thus changed in its chemical nature. As a result, the compounds\r\nwhich appear in the decomposing solution are commonly simpler than\r\nthe original food molecules. Such products are in general called\r\ndecomposition products, or sometimes cleavage products. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the bacteria have, in addition to their power of pulling\r\ntheir food to pieces, a further power of building other compounds\r\nout of the fragments, thus building up as well as pulling down.\r\nBut, however they do it, bacteria when growing in any food\r\nmaterial have the power of giving rise to numerous products which\r\ndid not exist in the food mass before. Because of their\r\nextraordinary powers of reproduction they are capable of producing\r\nthese changes very rapidly and can give rise in a short time to\r\nlarge amounts of the peculiar products of their growth.\r\n\r\nIt is to these powers of producing chemical changes in their food\r\nthat bacteria owe all their importance in the world. Their power\r\nof chemically destroying the food products is in itself of no\r\nlittle importance, but the products which arise as the result of\r\nthis series of chemical changes are of an importance in the world\r\nwhich we are only just beginning to appreciate. In our attempt to\r\noutline the agency which bacteria play in our industries and in\r\nnatural processes as well, we shall notice that they are sometimes\r\nof value simply for their power of producing decomposition; but\r\ntheir greatest value lies in the fact that they are important\r\nagents because of the products of their life.\r\n\r\nWe may notice, in the first place, that in the arts there are\r\nseveral industries which may properly be classed together as\r\nmaceration industries, all of which are based upon the\r\ndecomposition powers of bacteria. Hardly any animal or vegetable\r\nsubstance is able to resist their softening influence, and the\r\nartisan relies upon this power in several different directions.\r\n\r\nBENEFITS DERIVED FROM POWERS OF DECOMPOSITION.\r\n\r\nLinen.--Linen consists of certain woody fibres of the stem of the\r\nflax. The flax stem is not made up entirely of the valuable\r\nfibres, but largely of more brittle wood fibres, which are of no\r\nuse. The valuable fibres are, however, closely united with the\r\nwood and with each other in such an intimate fashion that it is\r\nimpossible to separate them by any mechanical means. The whole\r\ncellular substance of the stem is bound together by some cementing\r\nmaterials which hold it in a compact mass, probably a salt of\r\ncalcium and pectinic acid. The art of preparing flax is a process\r\nof getting rid of the worthless wood fibres and preserving the\r\nvaluable, longer, tougher, and more valuable fibres, which are\r\nthen made into linen. But to separate them it is necessary first\r\nto soften the whole tissue. This is always done through the aid of\r\nbacteria. The flax stems, after proper preparation, are exposed to\r\nthe action of moisture and heat, which soon develops a rapid\r\nbacterial growth. Sometimes this is done by simply exposing the\r\nflax to the dew and rain and allowing it to lie thus exposed for\r\nsome time. By another process the stems are completely immersed in\r\nwater and allowed to remain for ten to fourteen days. By a third\r\nprocess the water in which the flax is immersed is heated from 75\r\ndegrees to 90 degrees F., with the addition of certain chemicals,\r\nfor some fifty to sixty hours. In all cases the effect is the\r\nsame. The moisture and the heat cause a growth of bacteria which\r\nproceeds with more or less rapidity according to the temperature\r\nand other conditions. A putrefactive fermentation is thus set up\r\nwhich softens the gummy substance holding the fibres together. The\r\nprocess is known as \"retting,\" and after it is completed the\r\nfibres are easily isolated from each other. A purely mechanical\r\nprocess now easily separates the valuable fibres from the wood\r\nfibres. The whole process is a typical fermentation. A\r\ndisagreeable odour arises from the fermenting flax, and the liquid\r\nafter the fermentation is filled with products which make valuable\r\nmanure. The process has not been scientifically studied until very\r\nrecently. The bacillus which produces the \"retting\" is known now,\r\nhowever, and it has been shown that the \"retting\" is a process of\r\ndecomposition of the pectin cement. No method of separating the\r\nlinen fibres in the flax from the wood fibres has yet been devised\r\nwhich dispenses with the aid of bacteria.\r\n\r\nJute and Hemp.--Almost exactly the same use is made of bacterial\r\naction in the manufacture of jute und hemp. The commercial aspect\r\nof the jute industry has grown to be a large one, involving many\r\nmillions of dollars. Like linen, jute is a fibre of the inner bark\r\nof a plant, and is mixed in the bark with a mass of other useless\r\nfibrous material. As in the case of linen, a fermentation by\r\nbacteria is depended upon as a means of softening the material so\r\nthat the fibres can be disassociated. The process is called\r\n\"retting,\" as in the linen manufacture. The details of the process\r\nare somewhat different. The jute is commonly fermented in tanks of\r\nstagnant water, although sometimes it is allowed to soak in river\r\nwater for a sufficient length of time to produce the softening.\r\nAfter the fermentation is thus started the jute fibre is separated\r\nfrom the wood, and is of a sufficient flexibility and toughness to\r\nbe woven into sacking, carpets, curtains, table covers, and other\r\ncoarse cloth.\r\n\r\nPractically the same method is used in separating the tough fibres\r\nof the hemp. The hemp plant contains some long flexible fibres\r\nwith others of no value, and bacterial fermentation is relied upon\r\nto soften the tissues so that they may be separated.\r\n\r\nCocoanut fibre, a somewhat similar material is obtained from the\r\nhusk of the cocoanut by the same means. The unripened husk is\r\nallowed to steep and ferment in water for a long time, six months\r\nor a year being required. By this time the husk has become so\r\nsoftened that it can be beaten until the fibres separate and can\r\nbe removed. They are subsequently made into a number of coarse\r\narticles, especially valuable for their toughness. Door mats,\r\nbrushes, ships' fenders, etc., are illustrations of the sort of\r\narticles made from them.\r\n\r\nIn each of these processes the fermentation must have a tendency\r\nto soften the desired fibres as well as the connecting substance.\r\nPutrefaction attacks all kinds of vegetable tissue, and if this\r\n\"retting\" continues too long the desired fibre is decidedly\r\ninjured by the softening effect of the fermentation. It is quite\r\nprobable that, even as commonly carried on, the fermentation has\r\nsome slight injurious effect upon the fibre, and that if some\r\npurely mechanical means could be devised for separating the fibre\r\nfrom the wood it would produce a better material. But such\r\nmechanical means has not been devised, and at present a\r\nputrefactive fermentation appears to be the only practical method\r\nof separating the fibres.\r\n\r\nSponges.--A somewhat similar use is made of bacteria in the\r\ncommercial preparation of sponges. The sponge of commerce is\r\nsimply the fibrous skeleton of a marine animal. When it is alive\r\nthis skeleton is completely filled with the softer parts of the\r\nanimal, and to fit the sponge for use this softer organic material\r\nmust be got rid of. It is easily accomplished by rotting. The\r\nfresh sponges are allowed to stand in the warm sun and very\r\nrapidly decay. Bacteria make their way into the sponge and\r\nthoroughly decompose the soft tissues. After a short putrefaction\r\nof this sort the softened organic matter can be easily washed out\r\nof the skeleton and leave the clean fibre ready for market.\r\n\r\nLeather preparation.--The tanning of leather is a purely chemical\r\nprocess, and in some processes the whole operation of preparing\r\nthe leather is a chemical one. In others, however, especially in\r\nAmerica, bacteria are brought into action at one stage. The dried\r\nhide which comes to the tannery must first have the hair removed\r\ntogether with the outer skin. The hide for this purpose must be\r\nmoistened and softened. In some tanneries this is done by steeping\r\nit in chemicals. In others, however, it is put into water and\r\nslightly heated until fermentation arises. The fermentation\r\nsoftens it so that the outer skin can be easily removed with a\r\nknife, and the removal of hair is accomplished at the same time.\r\nBacterial putrefaction in the tannery is thus an assistance in\r\npreparing the skin for the tanning proper. Even in the subsequent\r\ntanning a bacterial fermentation appears to play a part, but\r\nlittle is yet known in regard to it.\r\n\r\nMaceration of skeletons.--The making of skeletons for museums and\r\nanatomical instruction in general is no very great industry, and\r\nyet it is one of importance. In the making of skeletons the\r\nprocess of maceration is commonly used as an aid. The maceration\r\nconsists simply in allowing the skeleton to soak in water for a\r\nday or two after cleaning away the bulk of the muscles. The\r\nputrefaction that arises softens the connective tissues so much\r\nthat the bones may be readily cleaned of flesh.\r\n\r\nCitric acid.--Bacterial fermentation is employed also in the\r\nordinary preparation of citric acid. The acid is made chiefly from\r\nthe juice of the lemon. The juice is pressed from the fruit and\r\nthen allowed to ferment. The fermentation aids in separating a\r\nmucilaginous mass and making it thus possible to obtain the citric\r\nacid in a purer condition. The action is probably similar to the\r\nmaceration processes described above, although it has not as yet\r\nbeen studied by bacteriologists.\r\n\r\nBENEFITS DERIVED FROM THE PRODUCTS OF BACTERIAL LIFE.\r\n\r\nWhile bacteria thus play a part in our industries simply from\r\ntheir power of producing decomposition, it is primarily because of\r\nthe products of their action that they are of value. Wherever\r\nbacteria seize hold of organic matter and feed upon it, there are\r\ncertain to be developed new chemical compounds, resulting largely\r\nfrom decomposition, but partly also from constructive processes.\r\nThese new compounds are of great variety. Different species of\r\nbacteria do not by any means produce the same compounds even when\r\ngrowing in and decomposing the same food material. Moreover, the\r\nsame species of bacteria may give rise to different products when\r\ngrowing in different food materials. Some of the compounds\r\nproduced by such processes are poisonous, others are harmless.\r\nSome are gaseous, others are liquids. Some have peculiar odours,\r\nas may be recognised from the smell arising from a bit of decaying\r\nmeat. Others have peculiar tastes, as may be realized in the gamy\r\ntaste of meat which is in the incipient stages of putrefaction. By\r\npurely empirical means mankind has learned methods of encouraging\r\nthe development of some of these products, and is to-day making\r\npractical use of this power, possessed by bacteria, of furnishing\r\ndesired chemical compounds. Industries involving the investment of\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars are founded upon the products of\r\nbacterial life, and they have a far more important relation to our\r\neveryday life than is commonly imagined. In many cases the artisan\r\nwho is dependent upon this action of microscopic life is unaware\r\nof the fact. His processes are those which experience has taught\r\nproduce desired results, but, nevertheless, his dependence upon\r\nbacteria is none the less fundamental.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN THE FERMENTATIVE INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nWe may notice, first, several miscellaneous instances of the\r\napplication of bacteria to various fermentative industries where\r\ntheir aid is of more or less value to man. In some of the examples\r\nto be mentioned the influence of bacteria is profound and\r\nfundamental, while in others it is only incidental. The\r\nfermentative industries of civilization are gigantic in extent,\r\nand have come to be an important factor in modern civilized life.\r\nThe large part of the fermentation is based upon the growth of a\r\nclass of microscopic plants which we call yeasts. Bacteria and\r\nyeasts are both microscopic plants, and perhaps somewhat closely\r\nrelated to each other. The botanist finds a difference between\r\nthem, based upon their method of multiplication, and therefore\r\nplaces them in different classes (Fig. 2, page 19). In their\r\ngeneral power of producing chemical changes in their food\r\nproducts, yeasts agree closely with bacteria, though the kinds of\r\nchemical changes are different. The whole of the great\r\nfermentative industries, in which are invested hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars, is based upon chemical decompositions\r\nproduced by microscopic plants. In the great part of commercial\r\nfermentations alcohol is the product desired, and alcohol, though\r\nit is sometimes produced by bacteria, is in commercial quantities\r\nproduced only by yeasts. Hence it is that, although the\r\nfermentations produced by bacteria are more common in Nature than\r\nthose produced by yeasts and give rise to a much larger number of\r\ndecomposition products, still their commercial aspect is decidedly\r\nless important than that of yeasts. Nevertheless, bacteria are not\r\nwithout their importance in the ordinary fermentative processes.\r\nAlthough they are of no importance as aids in the common\r\nfermentative processes, they are not infrequently the cause of\r\nmuch trouble. In the fermentation of malt to produce beer, or\r\ngrape juice to produce wine, it is the desire of the brewer and\r\nvintner to have this fermentation produced by pure yeasts, unmixed\r\nwith bacteria. If the yeast is pure the fermentation is uniform\r\nand successful. But the brewer and vintner have long known that\r\nthe fermentation is frequently interfered with by irregularities.\r\nThe troubles which arise have long been known, but the\r\nbacteriologist has finally discovered their cause, and in general\r\ntheir remedy. The cause of the chief troubles which arise in the\r\nfermentation is the presence of contaminating bacteria among the\r\nyeasts. These bacteria have been more or less carefully studied by\r\nbacteriologists, and their effect upon the beer or wine\r\ndetermined. Some of them produce acid and render the products\r\nsour; others make them bitter; others, again, produce a slimy\r\nmaterial which makes the wine or beer \"ropy.\" Something like a\r\nscore of bacteria species have been found liable to occur in the\r\nfermenting material and destroy the value of the product of both\r\nthe wine maker and the beer brewer. The species of bacteria which\r\ninfect and injure wine are different from those which infect and\r\ninjure beer. They are ever present as possibilities in the great\r\nalcoholic fermentations. They are dangers which must be guarded\r\nagainst. In former years the troubles from these sources were much\r\ngreater than they are at present. Since it has been demonstrated\r\nthat the different imperfections in the fermentative process are\r\ndue to bacterial impurities, commonly in the yeasts which are used\r\nto produce the fermentation, methods of avoiding them are readily\r\ndevised. To-day the vintner has ready command of processes for\r\navoiding the troubles which arise from bacteria, and the brewer is\r\nalways provided with a microscope to show him the presence or\r\nabsence of the contaminating bacteria. While, then, the alcoholic\r\nfermentations are not dependent upon bacteria, the proper\r\nmanagement of these fermentations requires a knowledge of their\r\nhabits and characters.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other fermentative processes of more or less\r\nimportance in their commercial aspects, which are directly\r\ndependent upon bacterial action, Some of them we should\r\nunhesitatingly look upon as fermentations, while others would\r\nhardly be thought of as belonging to the fermentation industries.\r\n\r\nVINEGAR.\r\n\r\nThe commercial importance of the manufacture of vinegar, though\r\nlarge, does not, of course, compare in extent with that of the\r\nalcoholic fermentations. Vinegar is a weak solution of acetic\r\nacid, together with various other ingredients which have come from\r\nthe materials furnishing the acid. In the manufacture of vinegar,\r\nalcohol is always used as the source of the acetic acid. The\r\nproduction of acetic acid from alcohol is a simple oxidation. The\r\nequation C2H6O + O2 = C2H4O2 + H2O shows the chemical change that\r\noccurs. This oxidation can be brought about by purely chemical\r\nmeans. While alcohol will not readily unite with oxygen under\r\ncommon conditions, if the alcohol is allowed to pass over a bit of\r\nplatinum sponge the union readily occurs and acetic acid results.\r\nThis method of acetic-acid production is possible experimentally,\r\nbut is impracticable on any large scale. In the ordinary\r\nmanufacture of vinegar the oxidation is a true fermentation, and\r\nbrought about by the growth of bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial manufacture of vinegar several different weak\r\nalcoholic solutions are used. The most common of these are\r\nfermented malt, weak wine, cider, and sometimes a weak solution of\r\nspirit to which is added sugar and malt. If these solutions are\r\nallowed to stand for a time in contact with air, they slowly turn\r\nsour by the gradual conversion of the alcohol into acetic acid. At\r\nthe close of the process practically all of the alcohol has\r\ndisappeared. Ordinarily, however, not all of it has been converted\r\ninto acetic acid, for the oxidation does not all stop at this\r\nstep. As the oxidation goes on, some of the acid is oxidized into\r\ncarbonic dioxide, which is, of course, dissipated at once into the\r\nair, and if the process is allowed to continue unchecked for a\r\nlong enough period much of the acetic acid will be lost in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation of the alcohol in all commercial production of\r\nvinegar is brought about by the growth of bacteria in the liquid.\r\nWhen the vinegar production is going on properly, there is formed\r\non the top of the liquid a dense felted mass known as the \"mother\r\nof vinegar.\" This mass proves to be made of bacteria which have\r\nthe power of absorbing oxygen from the air, or, at all events, of\r\ncausing the alcohol to unite with oxygen. It was at first thought\r\nthat a single species of bacterium was thus the cause of the\r\noxidation of alcohol, and this was named Mycoderma aceti. But\r\nfurther study has shown that several have the power, and that even\r\nin the commercial manufacture of vinegar several species play a\r\npart (Fig. 18), although the different species are not yet very\r\nthoroughly studied. Each appears to act best under different\r\nconditions. Some of them act slowly, and others rapidly, the slow-\r\ngrowing species appearing to produce the larger amount of acid in\r\nthe end. After the amount of acetic acid reaches a certain\r\npercentage, the bacteria are unable to produce more, even though\r\nthere be alcohol still left unoxidized. A percentage as high as\r\nfourteen per cent, commonly destroys all their power of growth.\r\nThe production of the acid is wholly dependent upon the growth of\r\nthe bacteria, and the secret of the successful vinegar manufacture\r\nis the skilful manipulation of these bacteria so as to keep them\r\nin the purest condition and to give them the best opportunity for\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nOne method of vinegar manufacture which is quite rapid is carried\r\non in a slightly different manner. A tall cylindrical chamber is\r\nfilled with wood shavings, and a weak solution of alcohol is\r\nallowed to trickle slowly through it. The liquid after passing\r\nover the shavings comes out after a number of hours well charged\r\nwith acetic acid. This process at first sight appears to be a\r\npurely chemical one, and reminds us of the oxidation which occurs\r\nwhen alcohol is allowed to pass over a platinum sponge. It has\r\nbeen claimed, indeed, that this is a chemical oxidation in which\r\nbacteria play no part. But this appears to be an error. It is\r\nalways found necessary in this method to start the process by\r\npouring upon the shavings some warm vinegar. Unless in this way\r\nthe shavings become charged with the vinegar-holding bacteria the\r\nalcohol will not undergo oxidation during its passage over them,\r\nand after the bacteria thus introduced have grown enough to coat\r\nthe shavings thoroughly the acetic-acid production is much more\r\nrapid than at first. If vinegar is allowed to trickle slowly down\r\na suspended string, so that its bacteria may distribute themselves\r\nthrough the string, and then alcohol be allowed to trickle over it\r\nin the same way, the oxidation takes place and acetic acid is\r\nformed. From the accumulation of such facts it has come to be\r\nrecognised that all processes for the commercial manufacture of\r\nvinegar depend upon the action of bacteria. While the oxidation of\r\nalcohol into acetic acid may take place by purely chemical means,\r\nthese processes are not practical on a large scale, and vinegar\r\nmanufacturers everywhere depend upon bacteria as their agents in\r\nproducing the oxidation. These bacteria, several species in all,\r\nfeed upon the nitrogenous matter in the fermenting mass and\r\nproduce the desired change in the alcohol.\r\n\r\nThis vinegar fermentation is subject to certain irregularities,\r\nand the vinegar manufacturers can not always depend upon its\r\noccurring in a satisfactory manner. Just as in brewing, so here,\r\ncontaminating bacteria sometimes find their way into the\r\nfermenting mass and interfere with its normal course. In\r\nparticular, the flavour of the vinegar is liable to suffer from\r\nsuch causes. As yet our vinegar manufacturers have not applied to\r\nacetic fermentation the same principle which has been so\r\nsuccessful in brewing--namely, the use, as a starter of the\r\nfermentation, of a pure culture of the proper species of bacteria.\r\nThis has been done experimentally and proves to be feasible. In\r\npractice, however, vinegar makers find that simpler methods of\r\nobtaining a starter--by means of which they procure a culture\r\nnearly though not absolutely pure--are perfectly satisfactory. It\r\nis uncertain whether really pure cultures will ever be used in\r\nthis industry.\r\n\r\nLACTIC ACID.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of lactic acid is an industry of less extent than\r\nthat of acetic acid, and yet it is one which has some considerable\r\ncommercial importance. Lactic acid is used in no large quantity,\r\nalthough it is of some value as a medicine and in the arts. For\r\nits production we are wholly dependent upon bacteria. It is this\r\nacid which, as we shall see, is produced in the ordinary souring\r\nof milk, and a large number of species of bacteria are capable of\r\nproducing the acid from milk sugar. Any sample of sour milk may\r\ntherefore always be depended upon to contain plenty of lactic\r\norganisms. In its manufacture for commercial purposes milk is\r\nsometimes used as a source, but more commonly other substances.\r\nSometimes a mixture of cane sugar and tartaric acid is used. To\r\nstart the fermentation the mixture is inoculated with a mass of\r\nsour milk or decaying cheese, or both, such a mixture always\r\ncontaining lactic organisms. To be sure, it also contains many\r\nother bacteria which have different effects, but the acid\r\nproducers are always so abundant and grow so vigorously that the\r\nlactic fermentation occurs in spite of all other bacteria. Here\r\nalso there is a possibility of an improvement in the process by\r\nthe use of pure cultures of lactic organisms. Up to the present,\r\nhowever, there has been no application of such methods. The\r\ncommercial aspects of the industry are not upon a sufficiently\r\nlarge scale to call for much in this direction.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the only method we have for the manufacture of\r\nlactic acid is dependent upon bacteria. Chemical processes for its\r\nmanufacture are known, but not employed commercially. There are\r\nseveral different kinds of lactic acid. They differ from each\r\nother in the relations of the atoms within their molecule, and in\r\ntheir relation to polarized light, some forms rotating the plane\r\nof polarized light to the right, others to the left, while others\r\nare inactive in this respect. All the types are produced by\r\nfermentation processes, different species of bacteria having\r\npowers of producing the different types.\r\n\r\nBUTYRIC ACID.\r\n\r\nButyric acid is another acid for which we are chiefly dependent\r\nupon bacteria. This acid is of no very great importance, and its\r\nmanufacture can hardly be called an industry; still it is to a\r\ncertain extent made, and is an article of commerce. It is an acid\r\nthat can be manufactured by chemical means, but, as in the case of\r\nthe last two acids, its commercial manufacture is based upon\r\nbacterial action. Quite a number of species of bacteria can\r\nproduce butyric acid, and they produce it from a variety of\r\ndifferent sources. Butyric acid is a common ingredient in old milk\r\nand in butter, and its formation by bacteria was historically one\r\nof the first bacterial fermentations to be clearly understood. It\r\ncan be produced also in various sugar and starchy solutions.\r\nGlycerine may also undergo a butyric fermentation. The presence of\r\nthis acid is occasionally troublesome, since it is one of the\r\nfactors in the rancidity of butter and other similar materials.\r\n\r\nINDIGO PREPARATION.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of indigo from the indigo plant is a fermentative\r\nprocess brought about by a specific bacterium. The leaves of the\r\nplant are immersed in water in a large vat, and a rapid\r\nfermentation arises. As a result of the fermentation the part of\r\nthe plant which is the basis of the indigo is separated from the\r\nleaves and dissolved in the water; and as a second feature of the\r\nfermentation the soluble material is changed in its chemical\r\nnature into indigo proper. As this change occurs the\r\ncharacteristic blue colour is developed, and the material is\r\nrendered insoluble in water. It therefore makes its appearance as\r\na blue mass separated from the water, and is then removed as\r\nindigo.\r\n\r\nOf the nature of the process we as yet know very little. That it\r\nis a fermentation is certain, and it has been proved that it is\r\nproduced by a definite species of bacterium which occurs on the\r\nindigo leaves. If the sterilized leaves are placed in sterile\r\nwater no fermentation occurs and no indigo is formed. If, however,\r\nsome of the specific bacteria are added to the mass the\r\nfermentation soon begins and the blue colour of the indigo makes\r\nits appearance. It is plain, therefore, that indigo is a product\r\nof bacterial fermentation, and commonly due to a single definite\r\nspecies of bacterium. Of the details of the formation, however, we\r\nas yet know little, and no practical application of the facts have\r\nyet been made.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN TOBACCO CURING.\r\n\r\nA fermentative process of quite a different nature, but of immense\r\ncommercial value, is found in the preparation of tobacco. The\r\nprocess by which tobacco is prepared is a long and somewhat\r\ncomplicated one, consisting of a number of different stages. The\r\ntobacco, after being first dried in a careful manner, is\r\nsubsequently allowed to absorb moisture from the atmosphere, and\r\nis then placed in large heaps to undergo a further change. This\r\nprocess appears to be a fermentation, for the temperature of the\r\nmass rises rapidly, and every indication of a fermentative action\r\nis seen. The tobacco in these heaps is changed occasionally, the\r\nheap being thrown down and built up again in such a way that the\r\nportion which was first at the bottom comes to the top, and in\r\nthis way all parts of the heap may become equally affected by the\r\nprocess. After this process the tobacco is sent to the different\r\nmanufacturers, who finish the process of curing. The further\r\ntreatment it receives varies widely according to the desired\r\nproduct, whether for smoking or for snuff, etc. In all cases,\r\nhowever, fermentations play a prominent part. Sometimes the leaves\r\nare directly inoculated with fermenting material. In the\r\npreparation of snuff the details of the process are more\r\ncomplicated than in the preparation of smoking tobacco. The\r\ntobacco, after being ground and mixed with certain ingredients, is\r\nallowed to undergo a fermentation which lasts for weeks, and\r\nindeed for months. In the different methods of preparing snuff the\r\nfermentations take place in different ways, and sometimes the\r\ntobacco is subjected to two or three different fermentative\r\nactions. The result of the whole is the slow preparation of the\r\ncommercial product. It is during the final fermentative processes\r\nthat the peculiar colour and flavour of the snuff are developed,\r\nand it is during the fermentation of the leaves of the smoking\r\ntobacco--either the original fermentation or the subsequent ones--\r\nthat the special flavours and aromas of tobacco are produced.\r\n\r\nIt can not be claimed for a moment that these changes by which the\r\ntobacco is cured and finally brought to a marketable condition are\r\ndue wholly to bacteria. There is no question that chemical and\r\nphysical phenomena play an important part in them. Nevertheless,\r\nfrom the moment when the tobacco is cut in the fields until the\r\ntime it is ready for market the curing is very intimately\r\nassociated with bacteria and fermentative organisms in general.\r\nSome of these processes are wholly brought about by bacterial\r\nlife; in others the micro-organisms aid the process, though they\r\nperhaps can not be regarded as the sole agents.\r\n\r\nAt the outset the tobacco producer has to contend with a number of\r\nmicro-organisms which may produce diseases in his tobacco. During\r\nthe drying process, if the temperature or the amount of moisture\r\nor the access of air is not kept in a proper condition, various\r\ntroubles arise and various diseases make their appearance, which\r\neither injure or ruin the value of the product. These appear to be\r\nproduced by micro-organisms of different sorts. During the\r\nfermentation which follows the drying the producer has to contend\r\nwith micro-organisms that are troublesome to him; for unless the\r\nphenomena are properly regulated the fermentation that occurs\r\nproduces effects upon the tobacco which ruin its character. From\r\nthe time the tobacco is cut until the final stage in the curing\r\nthe persons engaged in preparing it for market must be on a\r\nconstant watch to prevent the growth within it of undesirable\r\norganisms. The preparation of tobacco is for this reason a\r\ndelicate operation, and one that will be very likely to fail\r\nunless the greatest care is taken. In the several fermentative\r\nprocesses which occur in the preparation there is no question that\r\nmicro-organisms aid the tobacco producer and manufacturer.\r\nBacteria produce the first fermentation that follows the drying,\r\nand it is these organisms too, in large measure, that give rise to\r\nall the subsequent fermentations, although seemingly in some cases\r\npurely chemical processes materially aid. Now the special quality\r\nof the tobacco is in part dependent upon the peculiar type of\r\nfermentation which occurs in one or another of these fermenting\r\nactions. It is the fermentation that gives rise to the peculiar\r\nflavour and to the aroma of the different grades of tobacco.\r\nInasmuch as the various flavours which characterize tobacco of\r\ndifferent grades are developed, at least to a large extent, during\r\nthe fermentation processes, it is a natural supposition that the\r\ndifferent qualities of the tobacco, so far as concerns flavour,\r\nare due to the different types of fermentation. The number of\r\nspecies of bacteria which are found upon the tobacco leaves in the\r\nvarious stages of its preparation is quite large, and from what we\r\nhave already learned it is inevitable that the different kinds of\r\nbacteria will produce different results in the fermenting process.\r\nIt would seem natural, therefore, to assume that the different\r\nflavours of different grades may not unlikely be due to the fact\r\nthat the tobacco in the different cases has been fermented under\r\nthe influence of different kinds of bacteria.\r\n\r\nNor is this simply a matter of inference. To a certain extent\r\nexperimental evidence has borne out the conclusion, and has given\r\nat least a slight indication of practical results in the future.\r\nActing upon the suggestion that the difference between the high\r\ngrades of tobacco and the poorer grades is due to the character of\r\nthe bacteria that produce the fermentation, certain\r\nbacteriologists have attempted to obtain from a high quality of\r\ntobacco the species of bacteria which are infesting it. These\r\nbacteria have then been cultivated by bacteriological methods and\r\nused in experiments for the fermentation of tobacco. If it is true\r\nthat the flavour of high grade tobacco is in large measure, or\r\neven in part, due to the action of the peculiar microbes from the\r\nsoil where it grows, it ought to be possible to produce similar\r\nflavours in the leaves of tobacco grown in other localities, if\r\nthe fermentation of the leaves is carried on by means of the pure\r\ncultures of bacteria obtained from the high grade tobacco. Not\r\nvery much has been done or is known in this connection as yet. Two\r\nbacteriologists have experimented independently in fermenting\r\ntobacco leaves by the action of pure cultures of bacteria obtained\r\nfrom such sources. Each of them reports successful experiments.\r\nEach claims that they have been able to improve the quality of\r\ntobacco by inoculating the leaves with a pure culture of bacteria\r\nobtained from tobacco having high quality in flavour. In addition\r\nto this, several other bacteriologists have carried on experiments\r\nsufficient to indicate that the flavours of the tobacco and the\r\ncharacter of the ripening may be decidedly changed by the use of\r\ndifferent species of micro-organisms in the fermentations that go\r\non during the curing processes.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the whole matter, however, we must recognise that as\r\nyet we have very little knowledge. The subject has been under\r\ninvestigation for only a short time; and, while considerable\r\ninformation has been derived, this information is not thoroughly\r\nunderstood, and our knowledge in regard to the matter is as yet in\r\nrather a chaotic condition. It seems certain, however, that the\r\nquality of tobacco is in large measure dependent upon the\r\ncharacter of the fermentations that occur at different stages of\r\nthe curing. It seems certain also that these fermentations are\r\nwholly or chiefly produced by microorganisms, and that the\r\ncharacter of the fermentation is in large measure dependent upon\r\nthe species of micro-organisms that produce it. If these are\r\nfacts, it would seem not improbable that a further study may\r\nproduce practical results for this great industry. The study of\r\nyeasts and the methods of keeping yeast from contaminations has\r\nrevolutionised the brewing industry. Perhaps in this other\r\nfermentative industry, which is of such great commercial extent,\r\nthe use of pure cultures of bacteria may in the future produce as\r\ngreat revolutions in methods as it has in the industry of the\r\nalcoholic fermentation.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be inferred that the differences in grades\r\nof tobacco grown in different parts of the world are due solely to\r\nvariations in the curing processes and to the types of\r\nfermentation. There are differences in the texture of the leaves,\r\ndifferences in the chemical composition of the tobaccoes, which\r\nare due undoubtedly to the soils and the climatic conditions in\r\nwhich they grow, and these, of course, will never be affected by\r\nchanging the character of the ferment active processes. It is,\r\nhowever, probable that in so far as the flavours that distinguish\r\nthe high and low grades of tobacco are due to the character of the\r\nfermentative processes, they may be in the future, at least to a\r\nlarge extent, controlled by the use of pure cultures in curing\r\nprocesses. Seemingly, then, there is as great a future in the\r\ndevelopment of this fermentative industry as there has been in the\r\npast in the development of the fermentative industry associated\r\nwith brewing and vinting.\r\n\r\nOPIUM.\r\n\r\nOpium for smoking purposes is commonly allowed to undergo a curing\r\nprocess which lasts several months. This appears to be somewhat\r\nsimilar to the curing of tobacco. Apparently it is a fermentation\r\ndue to the growth of microorganisms. The organisms in question are\r\nnot, however, bacteria in this case, but a species of allied\r\nfungus. The plant is a mould, and it is claimed that inoculation\r\nof the opium with cultures of this mould hastens the curing.\r\n\r\nTROUBLESOME FERMENTATIONS.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this branch of the subject it is necessary to\r\nnotice some of the troublesome fermentations which are ever\r\ninterfering with our industries, requiring special methods, or,\r\nindeed, sometimes developing special industries to meet them. As\r\nagents of decomposition, bacteria will of course be a trouble\r\nwhenever they get into material which it is desired to preserve.\r\nSince they are abundant everywhere, it is necessary to count upon\r\ntheir attacking with certainty any fermentable substance which is\r\nexposed to air and water. Hence they are frequently the cause of\r\nmuch trouble. In the fermentative industries they occasionally\r\ncause an improper sort of fermentation to occur unless care is\r\ntaken to prevent undesired species of bacteria from being present.\r\nIn vinegar making, improper species of bacteria obtaining access\r\nto the solution give rise to undesirable flavours, greatly\r\ninjuring the product. In tobacco curing it is very common for the\r\nwrong species of bacteria to gain access to the tobacco at some\r\nstage of the curing and by their growth give rise to various\r\ntroubles. It is the ubiquitous presence of bacteria which makes it\r\nimpossible to preserve fruits, meats, or vegetables for any length\r\nof time without special methods. This fact in itself has caused\r\nthe development of one of our most important industries. Canning\r\nmeats or fruits consists in nothing more than bringing them into a\r\ncondition in which they will be preserved from attack of these\r\nmicro-organisms. The method is extremely simple in theory. It is\r\nnothing more than heating the material to be preserved to a high\r\ntemperature and then sealing it hermetically while it is still\r\nhot. The heat kills all the bacteria which may chance to be lodged\r\nin it, and the hermetical sealing prevents other bacteria from\r\nobtaining access. Inasmuch as all organic decomposition is\r\nproduced by bacterial growth, such sterilized and sealed material\r\nwill be preserved indefinitely when the operation is performed\r\ncarefully enough. The methods of accomplishing this with\r\nsufficient care are somewhat varied in different industries, but\r\nthey are all fundamentally the same. It is an interesting fact\r\nthat this method of preserving meats was devised in the last\r\ncentury, before the relation of micro-organisms to fermentation\r\nand putrefaction was really suspected. For a long time it had been\r\nin practical use while scientists were still disputing whether\r\nputrefaction could be avoided by preventing the access of\r\nbacteria. The industry has, however, developed wonderfully within\r\nthe last few years, since the principles underlying it have been\r\nunderstood. This understanding has led to better methods of\r\ndestroying bacterial life and to proper sealing, and these have of\r\ncourse led to greater success in the preservation, until to-day\r\nthe canning industries are among those which involve capital\r\nreckoned in the millions.\r\n\r\nOccasionally bacteria are of some value in food products. The gamy\r\nflavour of meats is nothing more than incipient decomposition.\r\nSauer Kraut is a food mass intentionally allowed to ferment and\r\nsour. The value of bacteria in producing butter and cheese\r\nflavours is noticed elsewhere. But commonly our aim must be to\r\nprevent the growth of bacteria in foods. Foods must be dried or\r\ncooked or kept on ice, or some other means adopted for preventing\r\nbacterial growth in them. It is their presence that forces us to\r\nkeep our ice box, thus founding the ice business, as well as that\r\nof the manufacture of refrigerators. It is their presence, again,\r\nthat forces us to smoke hams, to salt mackerel, to dry fish or\r\nother meats, to keep pork in brine, and to introduce numerous\r\nother details in the methods of food preparation and preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF BACTERIA TO THE DAIRY INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDairying is one of the most primitive of our industries. From the\r\nvery earliest period, ever since man began to keep domestic\r\ncattle, he has been familiar with dairying. During these many\r\ncenturies certain methods of procedure have been developed which\r\nproduce desired results. These methods, however, have been devised\r\nsimply from the accumulation of experience, with very little\r\nknowledge as to the reasons underlying them. The methods of past\r\ncenturies are, however, ceasing to be satisfactory. The advance of\r\nour civilization during the last half century has seen a marked\r\nexpansion in the extent of the dairy industry. With this expansion\r\nhas appeared the necessity for new methods, and dairymen have for\r\nyears been looking for them. The last few years have been teaching\r\nus that the new methods are to be found along the line of the\r\napplication of the discoveries of modern bacteriology. We have\r\nbeen learning that the dairyman is more closely related to\r\nbacteria and their activities than almost any other class of\r\npersons. Modern dairying, apart from the matter of keeping the\r\ncow, consists largely in trying to prevent bacteria from growing\r\nin milk or in stimulating their growth in cream, butter, and\r\ncheese. These chief products of the dairy will be considered\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF BACTERIA IN MILK.\r\n\r\nThe first fact that claims our attention is, that milk at the time\r\nit is secreted from the udder of the healthy cow contains no\r\nbacteria. Although bacteria are almost ubiquitous, they are not\r\nfound in the circulating fluids of healthy animals, and are not\r\nsecreted by their glands. Milk when first secreted by the milk\r\ngland is therefore free from bacteria. It has taken a long time to\r\ndemonstrate this fact, but it has been finally satisfactorily\r\nproved. Secondly, it has been demonstrated that practically all of\r\nthe normal changes which occur in milk after its secretion are\r\ncaused by the growth of bacteria. This, too, was long denied, and\r\nfor quite a number of years after putrefactions and fermentations\r\nwere generally acknowledged to be caused by the growth of micro-\r\norganisms, the changes which occurred in milk were excepted from\r\nthe rule. The uniformity with which milk will sour, and the\r\ndifficulty, or seeming impossibility, of preventing this change,\r\nled to the belief that the souring of milk was a normal change\r\ncharacteristic of milk, just as clotting is characteristic of\r\nblood. This was, however, eventually disproved, and it was finally\r\ndemonstrated that, beyond a few physical changes connected with\r\nevaporation and a slight oxidation of the fat, milk, if kept free\r\nfrom bacteria, will undergo no change. If bacteria are not\r\npresent, it will remain sweet indefinitely.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to draw milk from the cow in such a manner\r\nthat it will be free from bacteria except by the use of\r\nprecautions absolutely impracticable in ordinary dairying. As milk\r\nis commonly drawn, it is sure to be contaminated by bacteria, and\r\nby the time it has entered the milk pail it contains frequently as\r\nmany as half a million, or even a million, bacteria in every cubic\r\ninch of the milk. This seems almost incredible, but it has been\r\ndemonstrated in many cases and is beyond question. Since these\r\nbacteria are not in the secreted milk, they must come from some\r\nexternal sources, and these sources are the following:\r\n\r\nThe first in importance is the cow herself; for while her milk\r\nwhen secreted is sterile, and while there are no bacteria in her\r\nblood, nevertheless the cow is the most prolific source of\r\nbacterial contamination. In the first place, the milk ducts are\r\nfull of them. After each milking a little milk is always left in\r\nthe duct, and this furnishes an ideal place for bacteria to grow.\r\nSome bacteria from the air or elsewhere are sure to get into these\r\nducts after the milking, and they begin at once to multiply\r\nrapidly. By the next milking they become very abundant in the\r\nducts, and the first milk drawn washes most of them at once into\r\nthe milk pail, where they can continue their growth in the milk.\r\nAgain, the exterior of the cow's body contains them in abundance.\r\nEvery hair, every particle of dirt, every bit of dried manure, is\r\na lurking place for millions of bacteria. The hind quarters of a\r\ncow are commonly in a condition of much filth, for the farmer\r\nrarely grooms his cow, and during the milking, by her movements,\r\nby the switching of her tail, and by the rubbing she gets from the\r\nmilker, no inconsiderable amount of this dirt and filth is brushed\r\noff and falls into the milk pail The farmer understands this\r\nsource of dirt and usually feels it necessary to strain the milk\r\nafter the milking. But the straining it receives through a coarse\r\ncloth, while it will remove the coarser particles of dirt, has no\r\neffect upon the bacteria, for these pass through any strainer\r\nunimpeded. Again, the milk vessels themselves contain bacteria, for\r\nthey are never washed absolutely clean. After the most thorough\r\nwashing which the milk pail receives from the kitchen, there will\r\nalways be left many bacteria clinging in the cracks of the tin or\r\nin the wood, ready to begin to grow as soon as the milk once more\r\nfills the pail The milker himself contributes to the supply, for\r\nhe goes to the milking with unclean hands, unclean clothes, and\r\nnot a few bacteria get from him to his milk pail. Lastly, we find\r\nthe air of the milking stall furnishing its quota of milk bacteria.\r\nThis source of bacteria is, how ever, not so great as was formerly\r\nbelieved. That the air may contain many bacteria in its dust is\r\ncertain, and doubtless these fall in some quantity into the milk,\r\nespecially if the cattle are allowed to feed upon dusty hay before\r\nand during the milking. But unless the air is thus full of dust\r\nthis source of bacteria is not very great, and compared with the\r\nbacteria from the other sources the air bacteria are unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe milk thus gets filled with bacteria, and since it furnishes an\r\nexcellent food these bacteria begin at once to grow. The milk when\r\ndrawn is warm and at a temperature which especially stimulates\r\nbacterial growth. They multiply with great rapidity, and in the\r\ncourse of a few hours increase perhaps a thousandfold. The numbers\r\nwhich may be found after twenty-four hours are sometimes\r\ninconceivable; market milk may contain as many as five hundred\r\nmillions per cubic inch; and while this is a decidedly extreme\r\nnumber, milk that is a day old will almost always contain many\r\nmillions in each cubic inch, the number depending upon the age of\r\nthe milk and its temperature. During this growth the bacteria\r\nhave, of course, not been without their effect. Recognising as we\r\ndo that bacteria are agents for chemical change, we are prepared\r\nto see the milk undergoing some modifications during this rapid\r\nmultiplication of bacteria. The changes which these bacteria\r\nproduce in the milk and its products are numerous, and decidedly\r\naffect its value. They are both advantageous and disadvantageous\r\nto the dairyman. They are nuisances so far as concerns the milk\r\nproducer, but allies of the butter and cheese maker.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF BACTERIA ON MILK.\r\n\r\nThe first and most universal change effected in milk is its\r\nSOURING. So universal is this phenomenon that it is generally\r\nregarded as an inevitable change which can not be avoided, and, as\r\nalready pointed out, has in the past been regarded as a normal\r\nproperty of milk. To-day, however, the phenomenon is well\r\nunderstood. It is due to the action of certain of the milk\r\nbacteria upon the milk sugar which converts it into lactic acid,\r\nand this acid gives the sour taste and curdles the milk. After\r\nthis acid is produced in small quantity its presence proves\r\ndeleterious to the growth of the bacteria, and further bacterial\r\ngrowth is checked. After souring, therefore, the milk for some\r\ntime does not ordinarily undergo any further changes.\r\n\r\nMilk souring has been commonly regarded as a single phenomenon,\r\nalike in all cases. When it was first studied by bacteriologists\r\nit was thought to be due in all cases to a single species of\r\nmicro-organism which was discovered to be commonly present and\r\nnamed Bacillus acidi lactici (Fig. 19). This bacterium has\r\ncertainly the power of souring milk rapidly, and is found to be\r\nvery common in dairies in Europe. As soon as bacteriologists\r\nturned their attention more closely to the subject it was found\r\nthat the spontaneous souring of milk was not always caused by the\r\nsame species of bacterium. Instead of finding this Bacillus acidi\r\nlactici always present, they found that quite a number of\r\ndifferent species of bacteria have the power of souring milk, and\r\nare found in different specimens of soured milk. The number of\r\nspecies of bacteria which have been found to sour milk has\r\nincreased until something over a hundred are known to have this\r\npower. These different species do not affect the milk in the same\r\nway. All produce some acid, but they differ in the kind and the\r\namount of acid, and especially in the other changes which are\r\neffected at the same time that the milk is soured, so that the\r\nresulting soured milk is quite variable. In spite of this variety,\r\nhowever, the most recent work tends to show that the majority of\r\ncases of spontaneous souring of milk are produced by bacteria\r\nwhich, though somewhat variable, probably constitute a single\r\nspecies, and are identical with the Bacillus acidi lactici (Fig.\r\n19). This species, found common in the dairies of Europe,\r\naccording to recent investigations occurs in this country as well.\r\nWe may say, then, that while there are many species of bacteria\r\ninfesting the dairy which can sour the milk, there is one which is\r\nmore common and more universally found than others, and this is\r\nthe ordinary cause of milk souring.\r\n\r\nWhen we study more carefully the effect upon the milk of the\r\ndifferent species of bacteria found in the dairy, we find that\r\nthere is a great variety of changes which they produce when they\r\nare allowed to grow in milk. The dairyman experiences many\r\ntroubles with his milk. It sometimes curdles without becoming\r\nacid. Sometimes it becomes bitter, or acquires an unpleasant\r\n\"tainted\" taste, or, again, a \"soapy\" taste. Occasionally a\r\ndairyman finds his milk becoming slimy, instead of souring and\r\ncurdling in the normal fashion. At such times, after a number of\r\nhours, the milk becomes so slimy that it can be drawn into long\r\nthreads. Such an infection proves very troublesome, for many a\r\ntime it persists in spite of all attempts made to remedy it.\r\nAgain, in other cases the milk will turn blue, acquiring about the\r\ntime it becomes sour a beautiful sky-blue colour. Or it may become\r\nred, or occasionally yellow. All of these troubles the dairyman\r\nowes to the presence in his milk of unusual species of bacteria\r\nwhich grow there abundantly.\r\n\r\nBacteriologists have been able to make out satisfactorily the\r\nconnection of all these infections with different species of the\r\nbacteria. A large number of species have been found to curdle milk\r\nwithout rendering it acid, several render it bitter, and a number\r\nproduce a \"tainted\" and one a \"soapy\" taste. A score or more have\r\nbeen found which have the power of rendering the milk slimy. Two\r\ndifferent species at least have the power of turning the milk to\r\nsky-blue colour; two or three produce red pigments (Fig. 20), and\r\none or two have been found which produce a yellow colour. In\r\nshort, it has been determined beyond question that all these\r\ninfections, which are more or less troublesome to dairymen, are\r\ndue to the growth of unusual bacteria in the milk.\r\n\r\nThese various infections are all troublesome, and indeed it may be\r\nsaid that, so far as concerns the milk producer and the milk\r\nconsumer, bacteria are from beginning to end a source of trouble.\r\nIt is the desire of the milk producer to avoid them as far as\r\npossible--a desire which is shared also by everyone who has\r\nanything to do with milk as milk. Having recognised that the\r\nvarious troubles, which occasionally occur even in the better\r\nclass of dairies, are due to bacteria, the dairyman is, at least\r\nin a measure, prepared to avoid them. The avoiding of these\r\ntroubles is moderately easy as soon as dairymen recognise the\r\nsource from which the infectious organisms come, and also the fact\r\nthat low temperatures will in all cases remedy the evil to a large\r\nextent. With this knowledge in hand the avoidance of all these\r\ntroubles is only a question of care in handling the dairy. It must\r\nbe recognised that most of these troublesome bacteria come from\r\nsome unusual sources of infection. By unusual sources are meant\r\nthose which the exercise of care will avoid. It is true that the\r\nsouring bacteria appear to be so universally distributed that they\r\ncan not be avoided by any ordinary means. But all other\r\ntroublesome bacteria appear to be within control. The milkman must\r\nremember that the sources of the troubles which are liable to\r\narise in his milk are in some form of filth: either filth on the\r\ncow, or dust in the hay which is scattered through the barn, or\r\ndirt on cows' udders, or some other unusual and avoidable source.\r\nThese sources, from what we have already noticed, will always\r\nfurnish the milk with bacteria; but under common conditions, and\r\nwhen the cow is kept in conditions of ordinary cleanliness, and\r\nfrequently even when not cleanly, will only furnish bacteria that\r\nproduce the universal souring. Recognising this, the dairyman at\r\nonce learns that his remedies for the troublesome infections are\r\ncleanliness and low temperatures. If he is careful to keep his\r\nmilk vessels scrupulously clean; if he will keep his cow as\r\ncleanly as he does his horse; and if he will use care in and\r\naround the barn and dairy, and then apply low temperatures to the\r\nmilk, he need never be disturbed by slimy or tainted milk, or any\r\nof these other troubles; or he can remove such infections speedily\r\nshould they once appear. Pure sweet milk is only a question of\r\nsufficient care. But care means labour and expense. As long as we\r\ndemand cheap milk, so long will we be supplied with milk procured\r\nunder conditions of filth. But when we learn that cheap milk is\r\npoor milk, and when we are willing to pay a little more for it,\r\nthen only may we expect the use of greater care in the handling of\r\nthe milk, resulting in a purer product.\r\n\r\nBacteriology has therefore taught us that the whole question of\r\nthe milk supply in our communities is one of avoiding the too\r\nrapid growth of bacteria. These organisms are uniformly a nuisance\r\nto the milkman. To avoid their evil influence have been designed\r\nall the methods of caring for the dairy and the barn, all the\r\nmethods of distributing milk in ice cars. Moreover, all the\r\nspecial devices connected with the great industry of milk supply\r\nhave for their foundation the attempt to avoid, in the first\r\nplace, the presence of too great a number of bacteria, and. in the\r\nsecond place, the growth of these bacteria.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN BUTTER MAKING.\r\n\r\nCREAM RIPENING.--Passing from milk to butter, we find a somewhat\r\ndifferent story, inasmuch as here bacteria are direct allies to\r\nthe dairyman rather than his enemies. Without being aware of it,\r\nbutter makers have for years been making use of bacteria in their\r\nbutter making and have been profiting by the products which the\r\nbacteria have furnished them. Cream, as it is obtained from milk,\r\nwill always contain bacteria in large quantity, and these bacteria\r\nwill grow as readily in the cream as they will in the milk. The\r\nbutter maker seldom churns his cream when it is freshly obtained\r\nfrom the milk. There are, it is true, some places where sweet\r\ncream butter is made and is in demand, but in the majority of\r\nbutter-consuming countries a different quality of butter is\r\ndesired, and the cream is subjected to a process known as\r\n\"ripening\" or \"souring\" before it is churned. In ripening, the\r\ncream is simply allowed to stand in a vat for a period varying\r\nfrom twelve hours to two or three days, according to\r\ncircumstances. During this period certain changes take place\r\ntherein. The bacteria which were in the cream originally, get an\r\nopportunity to grow, and by the time the ripening is complete they\r\nbecome extremely numerous. As a result, the character of the cream\r\nchanges just as the milk is changed under similar circumstances.\r\nIt becomes somewhat soured; it becomes slightly curdled, and\r\nacquires a peculiarly pleasant taste and an aroma which was not\r\npresent in the original fresh cream. After this ripening the cream\r\nis churned. It is during the ripening that the bacteria produce\r\ntheir effect, for after the churning they are of less importance.\r\nPart of them collect in the butter, part of them are washed off\r\nfrom the butter in the buttermilk and the subsequent processes.\r\nMost of the bacteria that are left in the butter soon die, not\r\nfinding there a favourable condition for growth; some of them,\r\nhowever, live and grow for some time and are prominent agents in\r\nthe changes by which butter becomes rancid. The butter maker is\r\nconcerned with the ripening rather than with later processes.\r\n\r\nThe object of the ripening of cream is to render it in a better\r\ncondition for butter making. The butter maker has learned by long-\r\nexperience that ripened cream churns more rapidly than sweet\r\ncream, and that he obtains a larger yield of butter therefrom. The\r\ngreat object of the ripening, however, is to develop in the butter\r\nthe peculiar flavour and aroma which is characteristic of the\r\nhighest product. Sweet cream butter lacks flavour and aroma,\r\nhaving indeed a taste almost identically the same as cream.\r\nButter, however, that is made from ripened cream has a peculiar\r\ndelicate flavour and aroma which is well known to lovers of\r\nbutter, and which is developed during the ripening process.\r\n\r\nBacteriologists have been able to explain with a considerable\r\ndegree of accuracy the object of this ripening. The process is\r\nreally a fermentation comparable to the fermentation that takes\r\nplace in a brewer's malt. The growth of bacteria during the\r\nripening produces chemical changes of a somewhat complicated\r\ncharacter, and concerns each of the ingredients of the milk. The\r\nlactic-acid organisms affect the milk sugar and produce lactic\r\nacid; others act upon the fat, producing slight changes therein;\r\nwhile others act upon the casein and the albumens of the milk. As\r\na result, various biproducts of decomposition arise, and it is\r\nthese biproducts of decomposition that make the difference between\r\nthe ripened and the unripened cream. They render it sour and\r\ncurdle it, and they also produce the flavours and aromas that\r\ncharacterize it. Products of decomposition are generally looked\r\nupon as undesirable for food, and this is equally true of these\r\nproducts that arise in cream if the decomposition is allowed to\r\ncontinue long enough. If the ripening, instead of being stopped at\r\nthe end of a day or two, is allowed to continue several days, the\r\ncream becomes decayed and the butter made therefrom is decidedly\r\noffensive. But under the conditions of ordinary ripening, when the\r\nprocess is stopped at the right moment, the decomposition products\r\nare pleasant rather than unpleasant, and the flavours and aromas\r\nwhich they impart to the cream and to the subsequent butter are\r\nthose that are desired. It is these decomposition products that\r\ngive the peculiar character to a high quality of butter, and this\r\npeculiar quality is a matter that determines the price which the\r\nbutter maker can obtain for his product.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the butter maker is not always able to depend\r\nupon the ripening. While commonly it progresses in a satisfactory\r\nmanner, sometimes, for no reason that he can assign, the ripening\r\ndoes not progress normally. Instead of developing the pleasant\r\naroma and flavour of the properly ripened cream, the cream develops\r\nunpleasant tastes. It may be bitter or somewhat tainted, and just\r\nas sure as these flavours develop in the cream, so sure does the\r\nquality of the butter suffer. Moreover, it has been learned by\r\nexperience that some creameries are incapable of obtaining an\r\nequally good ripening of their cream. While some of them will\r\nobtain favourable results, others, with equal care, will obtain a\r\nfar less favourable flavour and aroma in their butter. The reason\r\nfor all this has been explained by modern bacteriology. In the\r\nmilk, and consequently in the cream, there are always found many\r\nbacteria, but these are not always of the same kinds. There are\r\nscores, and probably hundreds, of species of bacteria common in and\r\naround our barns and dairies, and the bacteria that are abundant\r\nand that grow in different lots of cream will not be always the\r\nsame. It makes a decided difference in the character of the\r\nripening, and in the consequent flavours and aromas, whether one or\r\nanother species of bacteria has been growing in the cream. Some\r\nspecies are found to produce good results with desired flavours,\r\nwhile others, under identical conditions, produce decidedly poor\r\nresults with undesired flavours. If the butter maker obtains cream\r\nwhich is filled with a large number of bacteria capable of\r\nproducing good flavours, then the ripening of his cream will be\r\nsatisfactory and his butter will be of high quality. If, however,\r\nit chances that his cream contains only the species which produce\r\nunpleasant flavours, then the character of the ripening will be\r\ndecidedly inferior and the butter will be of a poorer grade.\r\nFortunately the majority of the kinds of bacteria liable to get\r\ninto the cream from ordinary sources are such as produce either\r\ngood effects upon the cream or do not materially influence the\r\nflavour or aroma. Hence it is that the ripening of cream will\r\ncommonly produce good results. Bacteriologists have learned that\r\nthere are some species of bacteria more or less common around our\r\nbarns which produce undesirable effects upon flavour, and should\r\nthese become especially abundant in the cream, then the character\r\nof the ripening and the quality of the subsequent butter will\r\nsuffer. These malign species of bacteria, however, are not very\r\ncommon in properly kept barns and dairies. Hence the process that\r\nis so widely used, of simply allowing cream to ripen under the\r\ninfluence of any bacteria that happen to be in it, ordinarily\r\nproduces good results. But our butter makers sometimes find, at the\r\ntimes when the cattle change from winter to summer or from summer\r\nto winter feed, that the ripening is abnormal. The reason appears\r\nto be that the cream has become infested with an abundance of\r\nmalign species. The ripening that they produce is therefore an\r\nundesirable one, and the quality of the butter is sure to suffer.\r\n\r\nSo long as butter was made only in private dairies it was a matter\r\nof comparatively little importance if there was an occasional\r\nfalling off in quality of this sort. When it was made a few pounds\r\nat a time, and only once or twice a week, it was not a very\r\nserious matter if a few churnings of butter did suffer in quality.\r\nBut to-day the butter-making industries are becoming more and more\r\nconcentrated into large creameries, and it is a matter of a good\r\ndeal more importance to discover some means by which a uniformly\r\nhigh quality can be insured. If a creamery which makes five\r\nhundred pounds of butter per day suffers from such an injurious\r\nripening, the quality of its butter will fall off to such an\r\nextent as to command a lower price, and the creamery suffers\r\nmaterially. Perhaps the continuation of such a trouble for two or\r\nthree weeks would make a difference between financial success and\r\nfailure in the creamery. With our concentration of the butter-\r\nmaking industries it is becoming thus desirable to discover some\r\nmeans of regulating this process more accurately.\r\n\r\nThe remedy of these occasional ill effects in cream ripening has\r\nnot been within the reach of the butter maker. The butter maker\r\nmust make butter with the cream that is furnished him, and if that\r\ncream is already impregnated with malign species of bacteria he is\r\nhelpless. It is true that much can be done to remedy these\r\ndifficulties by the exercise of especial care in the barns of the\r\npatrons of the creamery. If the barns, the cows, the dairies, the\r\nmilk vessels, etc., are all kept in condition of strict\r\ncleanliness, if especial care is taken particularly at the seasons\r\nof the year when trouble is likely to arise, and if some attention\r\nis paid to the kind of food which the cattle eat, as a rule the\r\ncream will not become infected with injurious bacteria. It may be\r\ntaken as a demonstrated fact that these malign bacteria come from\r\nsources of filth, and the careful avoidance of all such sources of\r\nfilth will in a very large measure prevent their occurrence in the\r\ncream. Such measures as these have been found to be practicable in\r\nmany creameries. Creameries which make the highest priced and the\r\nmost uniform quality of butter are those in which the greatest\r\ncare is taken in the barns and dairies to insure cleanliness and\r\nin the handling of the milk and cream. With such attention a large\r\nportion of the trouble which arises in the creameries from malign\r\nbacteria may be avoided.\r\n\r\nBut these methods furnish no sure remedy against evils of improper\r\nspecies of bacteria in cream ripening, and do not furnish any sure\r\nmeans of obtaining uniform flavour in butter. Even under the very\r\nbest conditions the flavour of the butter will vary with the\r\nseason of the year. Butter made in the winter is inferior to that\r\nmade in the summer months; and while this is doubtless due in part\r\nto the different food which the cattle have and to the character\r\nof the cream resulting therefrom, these differences in the flavour\r\nof the butter are also in part dependent upon the different\r\nspecies of bacteria which are present in the ripening of cream at\r\ndifferent seasons. The species of bacteria in June cream are\r\ndifferent from those that are commonly present in January cream,\r\nand this is certainly a factor in determining the difference\r\nbetween winter and summer butter.\r\n\r\nUSE OF ARTIFICIAL BACTERIA CULTURES FOR CREAM RIPENING.\r\n\r\nBacteriologists have been for some time endeavouring to aid butter\r\nmakers in this direction by furnishing them with the bacteria\r\nneedful for the best results in cream ripening. The method of\r\ndoing this is extremely simple in principle, but proves to be\r\nsomewhat difficult in practice. It is only necessary to obtain the\r\nspecies of bacteria that produce the highest results, and then to\r\nfurnish these in pure culture and in large quantity to the butter\r\nmakers, to enable them to inoculate their cream with the species\r\nof bacteria which will produce the results that they desire. For\r\nthis purpose bacteriologists have been for several years searching\r\nfor the proper species of bacteria to produce the best results,\r\nand there have been put upon the market for sale several distinct\r\n\"pure cultures\" for this purpose. These have been obtained by\r\ndifferent bacteriologists and dairymen in the northern European\r\ncountries and also in the United States. These pure cultures are\r\nfurnished to the dairymen in various forms, but they always\r\nconsist of great quantities of certain kinds of bacteria which\r\nexperience has found to be advantageous for the purpose of cream\r\nripening.\r\n\r\nThere have hitherto appeared a number of difficulties in the way\r\nof reaching complete success in these directions. The most\r\nprominent arises in devising a method of using pure cultures in\r\nthe creamery. The cream which the butter makers desire to ripen\r\nis, as we have seen, already impregnated with bacteria, and would\r\nripen in a fashion of its own even if no pure culture of bacteria\r\nwere added thereto. Pure cultures can not therefore be used as\r\nsimply as can yeast in bread dough. It is plain that the simple\r\naddition of a pure culture to a mass of cream would not produce\r\nthe desired effects, because the cream would be ripened then, not\r\nby the pure culture alone, but by the pure culture plus all of the\r\nbacteria that were originally present. It would, of course, be\r\nsomething of a question as to whether under these conditions the\r\nresults would be favourable, and it would seem that this method\r\nwould not furnish any means of getting rid of bad tastes and\r\nflavours which have come from the presence of malign species of\r\nbacteria. It is plainly desirable to get rid of the cream bacteria\r\nbefore the pure culture is added. This can be readily done by\r\nheating it to a temperature of 69 degrees C. (155 degrees F.) for\r\na short time, this temperature being sufficient to destroy most of\r\nthe bacteria. The subsequent addition of the pure culture of\r\ncream-ripening bacteria will cause the cream to ripen under the\r\ninfluence of the added culture alone. This method proves to be\r\nsuccessful, and in the butter making countries in Europe it is\r\nbecoming rapidly adopted.\r\n\r\nIn this country, however, this process has not as yet become very\r\npopular, inasmuch as the heating of the cream is a matter of\r\nconsiderable expense and trouble, and our butter makers have not\r\nbeen very ready to adopt it. For this reason, and also for the\r\npurpose of familiarizing butter makers with the use of pure\r\ncultures, it has been attempted to produce somewhat similar though\r\nless uniform results by the use of pure cultures in cream without\r\nprevious healing. In the use of pure cultures in this way, the\r\nbutter maker is directed to add to his cream a large amount of a\r\nprepared culture of certain species of bacteria, upon the\r\nprinciple that the addition of such a large number of bacteria to\r\nthe cream, even though the cream is already inoculated with\r\ncertain bacteria, will produce a ripening of the cream chiefly\r\ninfluenced by the artificially added culture. The culture thus\r\nadded, being present in very much greater quantity than the other\r\n\"wild\" species, will have a much greater effect than any of them.\r\nThis method, of course, cannot insure uniformity. While it may\r\nwork satisfactorily in many cases, it is very evident that in\r\nothers, when the cream is already filled with a large number of\r\nmalign species of bacteria, such an artificial culture would not\r\nproduce the desired results. This appears to be not only the\r\ntheoretical but the actual experience. The addition of such pure\r\ncultures in many cases produces favourable results, but it does\r\nnot always do so, and the result is not uniform. While the use of\r\npure cultures in this way is an advantage over the method of\r\nsimply allowing the cream to ripen normally without such\r\nadditions, it is a method that is decidedly inferior to that which\r\nfirst pasteurizes the cream and subsequently adds a starter.\r\n\r\nThere is still another method of adding bacteria to cream to\r\ninsure a more advantageous ripening, which is frequently used,\r\nand, being simpler, is in many cases a decided advantage. This\r\nmethod is by the use of what is called a natural starter. A\r\nnatural starter consists simply of a lot of cream which has been\r\ntaken from the most favourable source possible--that is, from the\r\ncleanest and best dairy, or from the herd producing the best\r\nquality of cream--and allowing this cream to stand in a warm place\r\nfor a couple of days until it becomes sour. The cream will by that\r\ntime be filled with large numbers of bacteria, and this is then\r\nput as a starter into the vat of cream to be ripened. Of course,\r\nin the use of this method the butter maker has no control over the\r\nkinds of bacteria that will grow in the starter, but it is found,\r\npractically, that if the cream is taken from a good source the\r\nresults are extremely favourable, and there is produced in this\r\nway almost always an improvement in the butter.\r\n\r\nThe use of pure cultures is still quite new, particularly in this\r\ncountry. In the European butter-making countries they have been\r\nused for a longer period and have become very much better known.\r\nWhat the future may develop along this line it is difficult to\r\nsay; but it seems at least probable that as the difficulties in\r\nthe details are mastered the time will come when starters will be\r\nused by our butter makers for their cream ripening, just as yeast\r\nis used by housewives for raising bread, or by brewers for\r\nfermenting malt. These starters will probably in time be furnished\r\nby bacteriologists. Bacteriology, in other words, is offering in\r\nthe near future to our butter makers a method of controlling the\r\nripening of the cream in such a way as to insure the obtaining of\r\na high and uniform quality of butter, so far, at least, as\r\nconcerns flavour and aroma.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN CHEESE.\r\n\r\nCheese ripening.--The third great product of the dairy industry is\r\ncheese, and in connection with this product the dairyman is even\r\nmore dependent upon bacteria than he is in the production of\r\nbutter. In the manufacture of cheese the casein of the milk is\r\nseparated from the other products by the use of rennet, and is\r\ncollected in large masses and pressed, forming the fresh cheese.\r\nThis cheese is then set aside for several weeks, and sometimes for\r\nmonths, to undergo a process that is known as ripening. During the\r\nripening there are developed in the cheese the peculiar flavours\r\nwhich are characteristic of the completed product. The taste of\r\nfreshly made cheese is extremely unlike that of the ripened\r\nproduct. While butter made from unripened cream has a pleasant\r\nflavour, and one which is in many places particularly enjoyed,\r\nthere is nowhere a demand for unripened cheese, for the freshly\r\nmade cheese has a taste that scarce any one regards as pleasant.\r\nIndeed, the whole value of the cheese is dependent upon the\r\nflavour of the product, and this flavour is developed during the\r\nripening.\r\n\r\nThe cheese maker finds in the ripening of his cheese the most\r\ndifficult part of his manufacture. It is indeed a process over\r\nwhich he has very little control. Even when all conditions seem to\r\nbe correct, when cheese is made in the most careful manner, it not\r\ninfrequently occurs that the ripening takes place in a manner that\r\nis entirely abnormal, and the resulting cheese becomes worthless.\r\nThe cheese maker has been at an entire loss to understand these\r\nirregularities, nor has he possessed any means of removing them.\r\nThe abnormal ripening that occurs takes on various types.\r\nSometimes the cheese will become extraordinarily porous, filled\r\nwith large holes which cause the cheese to swell out of proper\r\nshape and become worthless. At other times various spots of red or\r\nblue appear in the manufactured cheese; while again unpleasant\r\ntastes and flavours develop which render the product of no value.\r\nSometimes a considerable portion of the product of the cheese\r\nfactory undergoes such irregular ripening, and the product for a\r\nlong time will thus be worthless. If some means could be\r\ndiscovered of removing these irregularities it would be a great\r\nboon to the cheese manufacturer; and very many attempts have been\r\nmade in one way or another to furnish the cheese maker with some\r\ndetails in the manufacture which will enable him in a measure to\r\ncontrol the ripening.\r\n\r\nThe ripening of the cheese has been subjected to a large amount of\r\nstudy on the part of bacteriologists who have been interested in\r\ndairy products. That the ripening of cheese is the result of\r\nbacterial growth therein appears to be probable from a priori\r\ngrounds. Like the ripening of cream, it is a process that occurs\r\nsomewhat slowly. It is a chemical change which is accompanied by\r\nthe destruction of proteid matter; it takes place best at certain\r\ntemperatures, and temperatures which we know are favourable to the\r\ngrowth of micro-organisms, all of which phenomena suggest to us\r\nthe action of bacteria. Moreover, the flavours and the tastes that\r\narise have a decided resemblance in many cases to the\r\ndecomposition products of bacteria, strikingly so in Limburger\r\ncheese. When we come to study the matter of cheese ripening\r\ncarefully we learn beyond question that this a priori conclusion\r\nis correct. The ripening of any cheese is dependent upon several\r\ndifferent factors. The method of preparation, the amount of water\r\nleft in the curd, the temperature of ripening, and other\r\nmiscellaneous factors connected with the mechanical process of\r\ncheese manufacture, affect its character. But, in addition to all\r\nthese factors, there is undoubtedly another one, and that is the\r\nnumber and the character of the bacteria that chance to be in the\r\ncurd when the cheese is made. While it is found that cheeses which\r\nare treated by different processes will ripen in a different\r\nmanner, it is also found that two cheeses which have been made\r\nunder similar conditions and treated in identically the same way\r\nmay also ripen in a different manner, so that the resulting\r\nflavour will vary. The variations between cheeses thus made may be\r\nslight or they may be considerable, but variations certainly do\r\noccur. Every one knows the great difference in flavours of\r\ndifferent cheeses, and these flavours are due in considerable\r\nmeasure to factors other than the simple mechanical process of\r\nmaking the cheese. The general similarity of the whole process to\r\na bacterial fermentation leads us to believe at the outset that\r\nsome of the differences in character are due to different kinds of\r\nbacteria that multiply in the cheese and produce decomposition\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter comes to be studied by bacteriology, the\r\ndemonstration of this position becomes easy. That the ripening of\r\ncheese is due to growth of bacteria is very easily proved by\r\nmanufacturing cheeses from milk which is deprived of bacteria. For\r\ninstance, cheeses have been made from milk that has been either\r\nsterilized or pasteurized--which processes destroy most of the\r\nbacteria therein--and, treated otherwise in a normal manner, are\r\nset aside to ripen. These cheeses do NOT ripen, but remain for\r\nmonths with practically the same taste that they had originally.\r\nIn other experiments the cheese has been treated with a small\r\namount of disinfective, which is sufficient to prevent bacteria\r\nfrom growing, and again ripening is found to be absolutely\r\nprevented. Furthermore, if the cheese under ordinary conditions is\r\nstudied during the ripening process, it is found that bacteria are\r\ngrowing during the whole time. These facts all taken together\r\nplainly prove that the ripening of cheese is a fermentation due to\r\nbacteria. It will be noticed, however, that the conditions in the\r\ncheese are not favourable for very rapid bacterial growth. It is\r\ntrue that there is plenty of food in the cheese for bacterial\r\nlife, but the cheese is not very moist; it is extremely dense,\r\nbeing subjected in all cases to more or less pressure. The\r\npenetration of oxygen into the centre of the mass must be\r\nextremely slight. The density, the lack of a great amount of\r\nmoisture, and the lack of oxygen furnish conditions in which\r\nbacteria will not grow very rapidly. The conditions are far less\r\nfavourable than those of ripening cream, and the bacteria do not\r\ngrow with anything like the rapidity that they grow in cream.\r\nIndeed, the growth of these organisms during the ripening is\r\nextremely slow compared to the possibilities of bacterial growth\r\nthat we have already noticed. Nevertheless, the bacteria do\r\nmultiply in the cheese, and as the ripening goes on they become\r\nmore and more abundant, although the number fluctuates, rising and\r\nfalling under different conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen the attempt is made to determine the relation of the\r\ndifferent kinds of ripening to different kinds of bacteria, it has\r\nthus far met with extremely little success. That different\r\nflavours are due to the ripening produced by different kinds of\r\nbacteria would appear to be almost certain when we remember, as we\r\nhave already noticed, the different kinds of decomposition\r\nproduced by different species of bacteria. It would seem,\r\nmoreover, that it ought not to be very difficult to separate from\r\nthe ripened cheese the bacteria which are present, and thus obtain\r\nthe kind of bacteria necessary to produce the desired ripening.\r\nBut for some reason this does not prove to be so easy in practice\r\nas it seems to be in theory. Many different species of bacteria\r\nhave been separated from cheeses. One bacteriologist, studying\r\nseveral cheeses, separated about eighty different species\r\ntherefrom, and others have found perhaps as many more from\r\ndifferent sources. Moreover, experiments have been made with a\r\nconsiderable number of these different kinds of bacteria to\r\ndetermine whether they are capable of producing normal ripening.\r\nThese experiments consist of making cheese out of milk that has\r\nbeen deprived of its bacteria, and which has been inoculated with\r\nlarge quantities of the species in question. Hitherto these\r\nexperiments have not been very satisfactory. In some cases the\r\ncheese appears to ripen scarcely at all; in other cases the\r\nripening occurs, but the resulting cheese is of a peculiar\r\ncharacter, entirely unlike the cheese that it is desired to\r\nimitate. There have been one or two experiments in recent times\r\nthat give a little more promise of success than the earlier ones,\r\nfor a few species of bacteria have been used in ripening with what\r\nthe authors have thought to be promising success. The cheese made\r\nfrom the milk artificially inoculated with these species ripens in\r\na satisfactory manner and gives some of the character desired,\r\nthough up to the present time in no case has the typical normal\r\nripening been produced in any of these experiments.\r\n\r\nBut these experiments have demonstrated beyond question that the\r\nabnormal ripening which is common in cheese factories is due to\r\nthe presence of undesirable species of bacteria in the milk. Many\r\nof the experiments in making cheeses by means of artificial\r\ncultures of bacteria have resulted in decidedly abnormal cheeses.\r\nMany of the cheeses thus manufactured have shown imperfections in\r\nripening which are identical with those actually occurring in the\r\ncheese factory. Several different species of bacteria have been\r\nfound which, when artificially used thus for ripening cheese, will\r\ngive rise to the porosity and the abnormal swelling of the cheese\r\nalready referred to (Fig. 24). Others produced bad tastes and\r\nflavours, and enough has been done in this line to demonstrate\r\nbeyond peradventure that the abnormal ripening of cheese is due\r\nprimarily to the growth of improper species therein. Quite a long\r\nlist of species of bacteria which produce abnormal ripening have\r\nbeen isolated from cheeses, and have been studied and experimented\r\nwith by bacteriologists. As a result of this study of abnormal\r\nripening, there has been suggested a method of partially\r\ncontrolling these--remedying them. The method consists simply in\r\ntesting the fermenting qualities of the milk used. A small sample\r\nof milk from different dairies is allowed to stand in the cheese\r\nfactory by itself until it undergoes its normal souring. If the\r\nfermentation or souring that thus occurs is of a normal character,\r\nthe milk is regarded as proper for cheese making. But if the\r\nfermentation that occurs in any particular sample of milk is\r\nunusual; if an extraordinary amount of gas bubbles are produced,\r\nor if unpleasant smells and tastes arise, the sample is regarded\r\nas unfavourable for cheese making, and as likely to produce\r\nabnormal ripening in the cheeses. Milk from this source would\r\ntherefore be excluded from the milk that is to be used in cheese\r\nmaking. This, of course, is a tentative and an unsatisfactory\r\nmethod of controlling the ripening, and yet it is one of some\r\npractical value to cheese makers. It is the only method that has\r\nyet been suggested of controlling the ripening.\r\n\r\nOur bacteriologists, of course, are quite confident that in the\r\nfuture more practical results will be obtained along this line\r\nthan in the past. If it is true that cheeses are ripened by\r\nbacteria; if it is true that different qualities in the cheese are\r\ndue to the growth of different species of bacteria during the\r\nripening, it would seem to be possible to obtain the proper kind\r\nof bacteria and to furnish them to the cheese maker for\r\nartificially inoculating his cheese, just as it has been possible\r\nto furnish artificially cultivated yeasts to the brewer, and as it\r\nhas become possible to furnish artificially cultivated bacteria to\r\nthe butter maker. We must, however, recognise this to be a matter\r\nfor the future. Up to the present time no practical results along\r\nthe lines of bacteria have been obtained which our cheese\r\nmanufacturers can make use of in the way of controlling with any\r\naccuracy this process of cheese ripening.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that in this last dairy product bacteria play\r\neven a more important part than in any of the others. The food\r\nvalue of cheese is dependent upon the casein which is present. The\r\nmarket price, however, is controlled entirely by the flavour, and\r\nthis flavour is a product of bacterial growth. Upon the action of\r\nbacteria, then, the cheese maker is absolutely dependent; and when\r\nour bacteriologists are able in the future to investigate this\r\nmatter further, it seems to be at least possible that they may\r\nobtain some means of enabling the cheese maker to control the\r\nripening accurately. Not only so, but recognising the great\r\nvariety in the flavours of cheese, and recognising that different\r\nkinds of bacteria undoubtedly produce different kinds of\r\ndecomposition products, it seems to be at least possible that a\r\ntime will come when the cheese maker will be able to produce at--\r\nwill any particularly desired flavour in his cheese by the\r\naddition to it of particular species of bacteria, or particular\r\nmixtures of species of bacteria which have been discovered to\r\nproduce the desired effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN NATURAL PROCESSES.--AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far, in considering the relations of bacteria to mankind, we\r\nhave taken into account only the arts and manufactures, and have\r\nfound bacteria playing no unimportant part in many of the\r\nindustries of our modern civilized life. So important are they\r\nthat there is no one who is not directly affected by them. There\r\nis hardly a moment in our life when we are not using some of the\r\ndirect or indirect products of bacterial action. We turn now,\r\nhowever, to the consideration of a matter of even more fundamental\r\nimportance; for when we come to study bacteria in Nature, we find\r\nthat there are certain natural processes connected with the life\r\nof animals and plants that are fundamentally based upon their\r\npowers. Living Nature appears limitless, for life processes have\r\nbeen going on in the world through countless centuries with\r\nseemingly unimpaired vigour. At the very bottom we find this\r\nnever-ending exhibition of vital power dependent upon certain\r\nactivities of micro-organisms. So thoroughly is this true that, as\r\nwe shall find after a short consideration, the continuance of life\r\nupon the surface of the world would be impossible if bacterial\r\naction were checked for any considerable length of time. The life\r\nof the globe is, in short, dependent upon these micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA AS SCAVENGERS.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we may notice the value of these organisms\r\nsimply as scavengers, keeping the surface of the earth in the\r\nproper condition for the growth of animals and plants. A large\r\ntree in the forest dies and falls to the ground. For a while the\r\ntree trunk lies there a massive structure, but in the course of\r\nmonths a slow change takes place in it. The bark becomes softened\r\nand falls from the wood. The wood also becomes more or less\r\nsoftened; it is preyed upon then by insect life; its density\r\ndecreases more and more, until finally it crumbles into a soft,\r\nbrownish, powdery mass, and eventually the whole sinks into the\r\nsoil, is overgrown by mosses and other vegetation, and the tree\r\ntrunk has disappeared from view. In the same way the body of the\r\ndead animal undergoes the process of the softening of its tissues\r\nby decay. The softer parts of the body rapidly dissipate, and even\r\nthe bones themselves eventually are covered with the soil and\r\ndisintegrated, until in time they, too, disappear from any visible\r\nexistence. This whole process is one of decay, and the result is\r\nthat the solid mass of the body of the tree or of the animal has\r\nbeen decomposed. What has become of it? The answer holds the\r\nsecret of Nature's eternal freshness. Part of it has dissipated\r\ninto the air in the form of gases and water vapour; part of it has\r\nchanged its composition and has become incorporated into the soil,\r\nthe final result being that the body of the plant or animal\r\ndisappears as such, and its substance is converted into gaseous\r\nform, which is dissipated in the air or into simple compounds\r\nwhich sink into the earth.\r\n\r\nThis whole process of decay of organic life is one in which\r\nbacteria play the most important part. In the case of the\r\ndecomposition of the woody matter of the tree trunk, the process\r\nis begun by the agency of moulds, for this group of organisms\r\nalone appears to be capable of attacking such hard woody\r\nstructure. The later part of the decay, however, is largely carried\r\non by bacterial life. In the decomposition of the animal tissues,\r\nbacteria alone are the agents. Thus the process by which organic\r\nmatter is dissipated into the air or incorporated into the soil is\r\none which is primarily presided over by bacterial life.\r\n\r\nViewing this matter in a purely mechanical light, the importance\r\nof bacteria in thus acting as scavengers can hardly be\r\noverestimated. If we think for a moment of the condition of the\r\nworld were there no such decomposing agents to rid the earth's\r\nsurface of the dead bodies of animals and plants, we shall see\r\nthat long since the earth would have been uninhabitable. If the\r\ndead bodies of plants and animals of past ages simply accumulated\r\non the surface of the ground without any forces to reduce them\r\ninto simple compounds for dissipation, by their very bulk they\r\nwould have long since completely covered the surface of the earth\r\nso as to afford no possible room for further growth of plants and\r\nanimals. In a purely mechanical way, then, bacteria as\r\ndecomposition agents are necessary to keep the surface of the\r\nearth fresh and unencumbered so that life can continue.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA AS AGENTS IN NATURE'S FOOD CYCLE.\r\n\r\nBut the matter by no means ends here. When we come to think of it,\r\nit is a matter of considerable surprise that the surface of the\r\nearth has been able to continue producing animals and plants for\r\nthe many millions of years during which life has been in\r\nexistence. Plants and animals both require food, animals depending\r\nwholly upon plants therefor. Plants, however, equally with\r\nanimals, require food, and although they obtain a considerable\r\nportion of their food from the air, yet no inconsiderable part of\r\nit is obtained from the soil. The question is forced upon us,\r\ntherefore, as to why the soil has not long since become exhausted\r\nof food. How could the soil continue to support plants year after\r\nyear for millions of years, and yet remain as fertile as ever?\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this phenomenon is in the simple fact that the\r\nprocesses of Nature are such that the same food is used over and\r\nover again, first by the plant, then by the animal, and then again\r\nby the plant, and there is no necessity for any end of the process\r\nso long as the sun furnishes energy to keep the circulation\r\ncontinuous. One phase of this transference of food from animal to\r\nplant and from plant to animal is familiar to nearly every one. It\r\nis a well-known fact that animals in their respiration consume\r\noxygen, but exhale it again in combination with carbon as carbonic\r\ndioxide. On the other hand, plants in their life consume the\r\ncarbonic dioxide and exhale the oxygen again as free oxygen. Thus\r\neach of these kingdoms makes use of the excreted product of the\r\nother, and this process can go on indefinitely, the animals\r\nfurnishing our atmosphere with plenty of carbonic acid for plant\r\nlife, and the plants excreting into the atmosphere at the same\r\ntime an abundant sufficiency of oxygen for animal life. The oxygen\r\nthus passes in an endless round from animal to plant and from\r\nplant to animal.\r\n\r\nA similar cycle is true of all the other foods of animal and plant\r\nlife, though in regard to the others the operation is more complex\r\nand more members are required to complete the chain. The\r\ntransference of matter through a series of changes by which it is\r\nbrought from a condition in which it is proper food for plants\r\nback again into a condition when it is once more a proper food for\r\nplants, is one of the interesting discoveries of modern science,\r\nand one in which, as we shall see, bacteria play a most important\r\npart. This food cycle is illustrated roughly by the accompanying\r\ndiagram; but in order to understand it, an explanation of the\r\nvarious steps in this cycle is necessary.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that at the bottom of the circle represented in\r\nFig. 25, at A, are given various ingredients which are found in\r\nthe soil and which form plant foods. Plant foods, as may be seen\r\nthere, are obtained partly from the air as carbonic dioxide and\r\nwater; but another portion comes from the soil. Among the soil\r\ningredients the most prominent are nitrates, which are the forms\r\nof nitrogen compounds most easily made use of by plants as a\r\nsource of this important element. It should be stated also that\r\nthere are other compounds in the soil which furnish plants with\r\npart of their food--compounds containing potassium, phosphorus,\r\nand some other elements. For simplicity's sake, however, these\r\nwill be left out of consideration. Beginning at the bottom of the\r\ncycle (Fig. 25 A), plant life seizes the gases from the air and\r\nthese foods from the soil, and by means of the energy furnished it\r\nby the sun's rays builds these simple chemical compounds into more\r\ncomplex ones. This gives us the second step, as shown in Fig. 25\r\nB, the products of plant life. These products of plant life\r\nconsist of such materials as sugar, starches, fats, and proteids,\r\nall of which have been manufactured by the plant from the\r\ningredients furnished it from the soil and air, and through the\r\nagency of the sun's rays. These products of plant life now form\r\nfoods for the animal kingdom. Starches, fats, and proteids are\r\nanimal foods, and upon such complex bodies alone can the animal\r\nkingdom be fed. Animal life, standing high up in the circle, is\r\nnot capable of extracting its nutriment from the soil, but must\r\ntake the more complex foods which have been manufactured by plant\r\nlife. These complex foods enter now into the animal and take their\r\nplace in the animal body. By the animal activities, some of the\r\nfoods are at once decomposed into carbonic acid and water, which,\r\nbeing dissipated into the air, are brought back at once into the\r\ncondition in which they can serve again as plant food. This part\r\nof the food is thus brought back again to the bottom of the circle\r\n(Fig. 25, dotted lines). But while it is true that animals do thus\r\nreduce some of their foods to the simple condition of carbonic\r\nacid and water, this is not true of most of the foods which\r\ncontain nitrogen. The nitrogenous foods are as necessary for the\r\nlife as the carbon foods, and animals do not reduce their\r\nnitrogenous foods to the condition in which plants can prey upon\r\nthem. While plants furnish them with nitrogenous food, they can\r\nnot give it back to the plants. Part of the nitrogenous foods\r\nanimals build into new albumins (Fig. 25 C); but a part of them\r\nthey reduce at once into a somewhat simpler condition known as\r\nurea. Urea is the form in which the nitrogen is commonly excreted\r\nfrom the animal body. But urea is not a plant food; for ordinary\r\nplants are entirely unable to make use of it. Part of the nitrogen\r\neaten by the animal is stored up in its body, and thus the body of\r\nthe animal, after it has died, contains these nitrogen compounds\r\nof high complexity. But plants are not able to use these\r\ncompounds. A plant can not be fed upon muscle tissue, nor upon\r\nfats, nor bones, for these are compounds so complex that the\r\nsimple plant is unable to use them at all. So far, then, in the\r\nfood cycle the compounds taken from the soil have been built up\r\ninto compounds of greater and greater complexity; they have\r\nreached the top of this circle, and no part of them, except part\r\nof the carbon and oxygen, has become reduced again to plant food.\r\nIn order that this material should again become capable of\r\nentering into the life of plants so as to go over the circle\r\nagain, it is necessary for it to be once more reduced from its\r\nhighly complex condition into a simpler one.\r\n\r\nNow come into play these decomposition agencies which we have been\r\nstudying under the head of scavengers. It will be noticed that the\r\nnext step in the food cycle is taken by the decomposition\r\nbacteria. These organisms, existing, as we have already seen, in\r\nthe air, in the soil, in the water, and always ready to seize hold\r\nof any organic substance that may furnish them with food, feed\r\nupon the products of animal life, whether they are such products\r\nas muscle tissue, or fat, or sugar, or whether they are the\r\nexcreted products of animal life, such as urea, and produce\r\ntherein the chemical decomposition changes already noticed. As a\r\nresult of this chemical decomposition, the complex bodies are\r\nbroken into simpler and simpler compounds, and the final result is\r\na very thorough destruction of the animal body or the material\r\nexcreted by animal life, and its reduction into forms simple\r\nenough for plants to use again as foods. Thus the bacteria come in\r\nas a necessary link to connect the animal body, or the excretion\r\nfrom the animal body, with the soil again, and therefore with that\r\npart of the circle in which the material can once more serve as\r\nplant food.\r\n\r\nBut in the decomposition that thus occurs through the agency of\r\nthe putrefactive bacteria it very commonly happens that some of\r\nthe food material is broken down into compounds too simple for use\r\nas plant food. As will be seen by a glance at the diagram (Fig. 25\r\nD), a portion of the cleavage products resulting from the\r\ndestruction of these animal foods takes the form of carbonic-acid\r\ngas and water. These ingredients are at once in condition for\r\nplant life, as shown by the dotted lines. They pass off into the\r\nair, and the green leaves of vegetation everywhere again seize\r\nthem, assimilate them, and use them as food. Thus it is that the\r\ncarbon and the oxygen have completed the cycle, and have come back\r\nagain to the position in the circle where they started. In regard\r\nto the nitrogen portion of the food, however, it very commonly\r\nhappens that the products which arise as the result of the\r\ndecomposition processes are not yet in proper condition for plant\r\nfood. They are reduced into a condition actually too simple for\r\nthe use of plants. As a result of these putrefactive changes, the\r\nnitrogen products of animal life are broken frequently into\r\ncompounds as simple as ammonia (NH3), or into compounds which the\r\nchemists speak of as nitrites (Fig. 25 at D). Now these compounds\r\nare not ordinarily within the reach of plant life. The luxuriant\r\nvegetation of the globe extracts its nitrogen from the soil in a\r\nform more complex than either of the compounds here mentioned;\r\nfor, as we have seen, it is nitrates chiefly that furnish plants\r\nwith their nitrogen food factor. But nitrates contain considerable\r\noxygen. Ammonia, which is one of the products of putrefactive de-\r\ncomposition, contains no oxygen, and nitrites, another factor,\r\ncontains less oxygen than nitrates. These bodies are thus too\r\nsimple for plants to make use of as a source of nitrogen. The\r\nchemical destruction of the food material which results from the\r\naction of the putrefactive bacteria is too thorough, and the\r\nnitrogen foods are not yet in condition to be used by plants.\r\n\r\nNow comes in the agency of still another class of micro-organisms,\r\nthe existence of which has been demonstrated to us during the last\r\nfew years. In the soil everywhere, especially in fertile soil, is\r\na class of bacteria which has received the name of nitrifying\r\nbacteria (Fig. 26). These organisms grow in the soil and feed upon\r\nthe soil ingredients. In the course of their life they have\r\nsomewhat the same action upon the simple nitrogen cleavage\r\nproducts just mentioned as we have already noticed the vinegar-\r\nproducing species have upon alcohol, viz., the bringing about a\r\nunion with oxygen. There are apparently several different kinds of\r\nnitrifying bacteria with different powers. Some of them cause an\r\noxidation of the nitrogen products by means of which the ammonia\r\nis united with oxygen and built up into a series of products\r\nfinally resulting in nitrates (Fig. 26). By the action of other\r\nspecies still higher nitrogen compounds, including the nitrites,\r\nare further oxidized and built up into the form of nitrates. Thus\r\nthese nitrifying organisms form the last link in the chain that\r\nbinds the animal kingdom to the vegetable kingdom (Fig. 25 at 4).\r\nFor after the nitrifying organisms have oxidized nitrogen cleavage\r\nproducts, the results of the oxidation in the form of nitrates or\r\nnitric acid are left in the soil, and may now be seized upon by\r\nthe roots of plants, and begin once more their journey around the\r\nfood cycle. In this way it will be seen that while plants, by\r\nbuilding up compounds, form the connecting link between the soil\r\nand animal life, bacteria in the other half of the cycle, by\r\nreducing them again, give us the connecting link between animal\r\nlife and the soil. The food cycle would be as incomplete without\r\nthe agency of bacterial life as it would be without the agency of\r\nplant life.\r\n\r\nBut even yet the food cycle is not complete. Some of the processes\r\nof decomposition appear to cause a portion of the nitrogen to fly\r\nout of the circle at a tangent. In the process of decomposition\r\nwhich is going on through the agency of micro-organisms, a\r\nconsiderable part of the nitrogen is dissipated into the air in\r\nthe form of free nitrogen. When a bit of meat decays, part of the\r\nmeat is, indeed, converted into ammonia or other nitrogen\r\ncompounds, but if the putrefaction is allowed to go on, in the end\r\na considerable portion of it will be broken into still simpler\r\nforms, and the nitrogen will finally be dissipated into the air in\r\nthe form of free nitrogen. This dissipation of free nitrogen into\r\nthe air is going on in the world wherever putrefaction takes\r\nplace. Wherever decomposition of nitrogen products occurs some\r\nfree nitrogen is eliminated. Now, this part of the nitrogen has\r\npassed beyond the reach of plants, for plants can not extract free\r\nnitrogen from the air. In the diagram this is represented as a\r\nportion of the material which, through the agency of the\r\ndecomposition bacteria, has been thrown out of the cycle at a\r\ntangent (Fig. 25 E). It will, of course, be plain from this that\r\nthe store of nitrogen food must be constantly diminishing. The\r\nsoil may have been originally supplied with a given quantity of\r\nnitrogen compound, but if the decomposition products are causing\r\nconsiderable quantities of this nitrogen to be dissipated in the\r\nair, it plainly follows that the total amount of nitrogen food\r\nupon which the animal and vegetable kingdoms can depend is\r\nbecoming constantly reduced by such dissipation.\r\n\r\nThere are still other methods by which nitrogen is being lost from\r\nthe food cycle. First, we may notice that the ordinary processes\r\nof vegetation result in a gradual draining of the soil and a\r\nthrowing of its nitrogen into the ocean. The body of any animal or\r\nany plant that chances to fall into a brook or river is eventually\r\ncarried to the sea, and the products of its decomposition pass\r\ninto the ocean and are, of course, lost to the soil. Now, while\r\nthis gradual extraction of nitrogen from the soil by drainage is a\r\nslow one, it is nevertheless a sure one. It is far more rapid in\r\nthese years of civilized life than in former times, since the\r\nproducts of the soil are given to the city, and then are thrown\r\ninto its sewage Our cities, then, with our present system of\r\ndisposing of sewage, are draining from the soil the nitrogen\r\ncompounds and throwing them away.\r\n\r\nIn yet another direction must it be noticed that our nitrogen\r\ncompounds are being lost to plant life--viz., by the use of various\r\nnitrogen compounds to form explosives. Gunpowder, nitro-glycerine,\r\ndynamite, in fact, nearly all the explosives that are used the\r\nworld over for all sorts of purposes, are nitrogen compounds. When\r\nthey are exploded the nitrogen of the compound is dissipated into\r\nthe air in the form of gas, much of it in the form of free\r\nnitrogen. The basis from which explosive compounds are made\r\ncontains nitrogen in the form in which it can be used by plants.\r\nSaltpetre, for example, is equally good as a fertilizer and as a\r\nbasis for gunpowder. The products of the explosion are gases no\r\nlonger capable of use by plants, and thus every explosion of\r\nnitrogen compounds aids in this gradual dissipation of nitrogen\r\nproducts, taking them from the store of plant foods and throwing\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\nAll of these agencies contribute to reduce the amount of material\r\ncirculating in the food cycle of Nature, and thus seem to tend\r\ninevitably in the end toward a termination of the processes of\r\nlife; for as soon as the soil becomes exhausted of its nitrogen\r\ncompounds, so soon will plant life cease from lack of nutrition,\r\nand the disappearance of animal life will follow rapidly. It is\r\nthis loss of nitrogen in large measure that is forcing our\r\nagriculturists to purchase fertilizers. The last fifteen years\r\nhave shown us, however, that here again we may look upon our\r\nfriends, the bacteria, as agents for counteracting this\r\ndissipating tendency in the general processes of Nature. Bacterial\r\nlife in at least two different ways appears to have the function\r\nof reclaiming from the atmosphere more or less of this dissipated\r\nfree nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it has been found in the last few years that\r\nsoil entirely free from all common plants, but containing certain\r\nkinds of bacteria, if allowed to stand in contact with the air,\r\nwill slowly but surely gain in the amount of nitrogen compounds\r\nthat it contains. These nitrogen compounds are plainly\r\nmanufactured by the bacteria in the soil; for unless the bacteria\r\nare present they do not accumulate, and they do accumulate\r\ninevitably if the bacteria are present in the proper quantity and\r\nthe proper species. It appears that, as a rule, this fixation of\r\nnitrogen is not performed by any one species of microorganisms,\r\nbut by two or three of them acting together. Certain combinations\r\nof bacteria have been found which, when inoculated in the soil,\r\nwill bring about this fixation of nitrogen, but no one of the\r\nspecies is capable of producing this result alone. We do not know\r\nto what extent these organisms are distributed in the soil, nor\r\nhow widely this nitrogen fixation through bacterial life is going\r\non. It is only within a short time that it has been demonstrated\r\nto exist, but we must look upon bacteria in the soil as one of the\r\nfactors in reclaiming from the atmosphere the dissipated free\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe second method by which bacteria aid in the reclaiming of this\r\nlost nitrogen is by a combined action of certain species of\r\nbacteria and some of the higher plants. Ordinary green plants, as\r\nalready noted, are unable to make use of the free nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere It was found, however, some fifteen years ago that some\r\nspecies of plants, chiefly the great family of legumes, which\r\ncontains the pea plant, the bean, the clover, etc, are able, when\r\ngrowing in soil that is poor in nitrogen, to obtain nitrogen from\r\nsome source other than the soil in which they grow. A pea plant in\r\nsoil that contains no nitrogen products and watered with water\r\nthat contains no nitrogen, will, after sprouting and growing for a\r\nlength of time, be found to have accumulated a considerable\r\nquantity of fixed nitrogen in its tissues The only source of this\r\nnitrogen has been evidently from the air which bathes the leaves\r\nof the plant or permeates the soil and bathes its roots This fact\r\nwas at first disputed, but subsequently demonstrated to be true,\r\nand was found later to be associated with the combined action of\r\nthese legumes and certain soil bacteria. When a legume thus gains\r\nnitrogen from the air, it develops upon its roots little bunches\r\nknown as root nodules or root tubercles. The nodules are sometimes\r\nthe size of the head of a pm, and sometimes much larger than this,\r\noccasionally reaching the size of a large pea, or even larger.\r\nUpon microscopic examination they are found to be little nests of\r\nbacteria In some way the soil organisms (Fig 27) make their way\r\ninto the roots of the sprouting plant, and finding there congenial\r\nenvironment, develop in considerable quantities and produce root\r\ntubercles in the root. Now, by some entirely unknown process, the\r\nlegume and the bacteria growing together succeed in extracting\r\nthe nitrogen from the atmosphere which permeates the soil, and\r\nfixing this nitrogen in the tubercles and the roots in the form of\r\nnitrogen compounds. The result is that, after a proper period of\r\ngrowth, the amount of fixed nitrogen in the plant is found to have\r\nvery decidedly increased (Fig 25 E).\r\n\r\nThis, of course, furnishes a starting point for the reclaiming of\r\nthe lost atmospheric nitrogen. The legume continues to live its\r\nusual life, perhaps increasing the store of nitrogen in its roots\r\nand stems and leaves during the whole of its normal growth.\r\nSubsequently, after having finished its ordinary life, the plant\r\nwill die, and then the roots and stems and leaves, falling upon\r\nthe ground and becoming buried, will be seized upon by the\r\ndecomposition bacteria already mentioned. The nitrogen which has\r\nthus become fixed in their tissues will undergo the destructive\r\nchanges already described. This will result eventually in the\r\nproduction of nitrates. Thus some of the lost nitrogen is restored\r\nagain to the soil in the form of nitrates, and may now start on\r\nits route once more around the cycle of food.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that the food cycle is a complete one.\r\nBeginning with the mineral ingredients in the soil, the food\r\nmatter may start on its circulation from the soil to the plant,\r\nfrom the plant to the animal, from the animal to the bacterium and\r\nfrom the bacterium through a series of other bacteria back again\r\nto the soil in the condition in which it started. If, perchance,\r\nin this progress around the circle some of the nitrogen is thrown\r\noff at a tangent, this, too, is brought back again to the circle\r\nthrough the agency of bacterial life. And so the food material of\r\nanimals and plants continues in this never-ceasing circulation. It\r\nis the sunlight that furnishes the energy for the motion. It is\r\nthe sunlight that forces the food around the circle and keeps up\r\nthe endless change; and so long as, the sun continues to shine\r\nupon the earth there seems to be no reason why the process should\r\never cease. It is this repeated circulation that has made the\r\ncontinuation of life possible for the millions and millions of\r\nyears of the earth's history. It is this continued circulation\r\nthat makes life possible still, and it is only this fact that the\r\nfood is thus capable of ever circulating from animal to plant and\r\nfrom plant to animal that makes it possible for the living world\r\nto continue its existence. But, ah we have seen, one half of this\r\ngreat circle of food change is dependent upon bacterial life.\r\nWithout the bacterial life the animal body and the animal\r\nexcretion could never be brought back again within the reach of\r\nthe plant; and thus, were it not for the action of these micro-\r\norganisms the food cycle would be incomplete and life could not\r\ncontinue indefinitely upon the surface of the earth. At the very\r\nfoundation, the continuation of the present condition of Nature\r\nand the existence of life during the past history of the world has\r\nbeen fundamentally based upon the ubiquitous presence of bacteria\r\nand upon their continual action in connection with both\r\ndestructive and constructive processes.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF BACTERIA TO AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed that bacteria play an important part in\r\nsome of the agricultural industries, particularly in the dairy.\r\nFrom the consideration of the matters just discussed, it is\r\nmanifest that these organisms must have an even more intimate\r\nrelation to the farmer's occupation. At the foundation, farming\r\nconsists in the cultivation of plants and animals, and we have\r\nalready seen how essential are the bacteria in the continuance of\r\nanimal and plant life. But aside from these theoretical\r\nconsiderations, a little study shows that in a very practical\r\nmanner the farmer is ever making use of bacteria, as a rule, quite\r\nunconsciously, but none the less positively.\r\n\r\nSPROUTING OF SEEDS.\r\n\r\nEven in the sprouting of seeds after they are sown in the soil\r\nbacterial life has its influence. When seeds are placed m moist\r\nsoil they germinate under the influence of heat. The rich\r\nalbuminous material in the seeds furnishes excellent food, and\r\ninasmuch as bacteria abound in the soil, it is inevitable that\r\nthey should grow in and feed upon the seed. If the moisture is\r\nexcessive and the heat considerable, they very frequently grow so\r\nrapidly in the seed as to destroy its life as a seedling. The seed\r\nrots in the ground as a result. This does not commonly occur,\r\nhowever, in ordinary soil. But even here bacteria do grow in the\r\nseed, though not so abundantly as to produce any injury. Indeed,\r\nit has been claimed that their presence in the seed in small\r\nquantities is a necessity for the proper sprouting of the seed. It\r\nhas been claimed that their growth tends to soften the food\r\nmaterial in the seed, so that the young seedling can more readily\r\nabsorb it for its own food, and that without such a softening the\r\nseed remains too hard for the plant to use. This may well be\r\ndoubted, however, for seeds can apparently sprout well enough\r\nwithout the aid of bacteria. But, nevertheless, bacteria do grow\r\nin the seed during its germination, and thus do aid the plant in\r\nthe softening of the food material. We can not regard them as\r\nessential to seed germination. It may well be claimed that they\r\nordinarily play at least an incidental part in this fundamental\r\nlife process, although it is uncertain whether the growth of\r\nseedlings is to any considerable extent aided thereby.\r\n\r\nTHE SILO.\r\n\r\nIn the management of a silo the farmer has undoubtedly another\r\ngreat bacteriological problem. In the attempt to preserve his\r\nsummer-grown food for the winter use of his animals, he is\r\nhindered by the activity of common bacteria. If the food is kept\r\nmoist, it is sure to undergo decomposition and be ruined in a\r\nshort time as animal food. The farmer finds it necessary,\r\ntherefore, to dry some kinds of foods, like hay. While he can thus\r\npreserve some foods, others can not be so treated. Much of the\r\nrank growth of the farm, like cornstalks, is good food while it is\r\nfresh, but is of little value when dried. The farmer has from\r\nexperience and observation discovered a method of managing\r\nbacterial growth which enables him to avoid their ordinary evil\r\neffects. This is by the use of the silo. The silo is a large,\r\nheavily built box, which is open only at the top. In the silo the\r\ngreen food is packed tightly, and when full all access of air is\r\nexcluded, except at its surface. Under these conditions the food\r\nremains moist, but nevertheless does not undergo its ordinary\r\nfermentations and putrefactions, and may be preserved for months\r\nwithout being ruined. The food in such a silo may be taken out\r\nmonths after it is packed, and will still be found to be in good\r\ncondition for food. It is true that it has changed its character\r\nsomewhat, but it is not decayed, and is eagerly eaten by cattle.\r\n\r\nWe are yet very ignorant of the nature of the changes which occur\r\nm the food while in the silo. The food is not preserved from\r\nfermentation. When the siloxis packed slowly, a very decided\r\nfermentation occurs by which the mass is raised to a high\r\ntemperature (140 degrees F. to 160 degrees F.). This heating is\r\nproduced by certain species of bacteria which grow readily even at\r\nthis high temperature. The fermentation uses up the air in the\r\nsilo to a certain extent and produces a settling of the material\r\nwhich still further excludes air. The first fermentation soon\r\nceases, and afterward only slow changes occur. Certain acid-\r\nproducing bacteria after a little begin to grow slowly, and in\r\ntime the silage is rendered somewhat sour by the production of\r\nacetic acid. But the exclusion of air, the close packing, and the\r\nsmall amount of moisture appear to prevent the growth of the\r\ncommon putrefactive bacteria, and the silage remains good for a\r\nlong time. In other methods of filling the silo, the food is very\r\nquickly packed and densely crowded together so as to exclude as\r\nmuch air as possible from the beginning. Under these conditions\r\nthe lack of moisture and air prevents fermentative action very\r\nlargely. Only certain acid-producing organisms grow, and these\r\nvery slowly. The essential result in either case is that the\r\ncommon putrefactive bacteria are prevented from growing, probably\r\nby lack of sufficient oxygen and moisture, and thus the decay is\r\nprevented. The closely packed food offers just the same\r\nunfavourable condition for the growth of common putrefactive\r\nbacteria that we have already seen offered by the hard-pressed\r\ncheese, and the bacteria growth is in the same way held in check.\r\nOur knowledge of the matter is as yet very slight, but we do know\r\nenough to understand that the successful management of a silo is\r\ndependent upon the manipulation of bacteria.\r\n\r\nTHE FERTILITY OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe farmer's sole duty is to extract food from the soil. This he\r\ndoes either directly by raising crops, or indirectly by raising\r\nanimals which feed upon the products of the soil. In either case\r\nthe fertility of the soil is the fundamental factor in his\r\nsuccess. This fertility is a gift to him from the bacteria.\r\n\r\nEven in the first formation of soil he is in a measure dependent\r\nupon bacteria. Soil, as is well known, is produced in large part\r\nby the crumbling of the rocks into powder. This crumbling we\r\ngenerally call weathering, and regard it as due to the effect of\r\nmoisture and cold upon the rocks, together with the oxidizing\r\naction of the air. Doubtless this is true, and the weathering\r\naction is largely a physical and chemical one. Nevertheless, in\r\nthis fundamental process of rock disintegration bacterial action\r\nplays a part, though perhaps a small one. Some species of\r\nbacteria, as we have seen, can live upon very simple foods,\r\nfinding in free nitrogen and carbonates sufficiently highly\r\ncomplex material for their life. These organisms appear to grow on\r\nthe bare surface of rocks, assimilating nitrogen from the air, and\r\ncarbon from some widely diffused carbonates or from the CO2 in the\r\nair. Their secreted products of an acid nature help to soften the\r\nrocks, and thus aid in performing the first step in weathering.\r\n\r\nThe soil is not, however, all made up of disintegrated rocks. It\r\ncontains, besides, various ingredients which combine to make it\r\nfertile. Among these are various sulphates which form important\r\nparts of plant foods. These sulphates appear to be formed, in\r\npart, at least, by bacterial agency. The decomposition of proteids\r\ngives rise, among other things, to hydrogen sulphide (H2S). This\r\ngas, which is of common occurrence in the atmosphere, is oxidized\r\nby bacterial growth into sulphuric acid, and this is the basis of\r\npart of the soil sulphates. The deposition of iron phosphates and\r\niron silicates is probably also in a measure aided by bacterial\r\naction. All of these processes are factors in the formation of\r\nsoil. Beyond much question the rock disintegration which occurs\r\neverywhere in Nature is chiefly the result of physical and\r\nchemical changes, but there is reason for believing that the\r\nphysical and chemical processes are, to a slight extent at least,\r\nassisted by bacterial life.\r\n\r\nA more important factor of soil fertility is its nitrogen content,\r\nwithout which it is completely barren. The origin of these\r\nnitrogen ingredients has been more or less of a puzzle. Fertile\r\nsoil everywhere contains nitrates and other nitrogen compounds,\r\nand in certain parts of the world there are large accumulations of\r\nthese compounds, like the nitrate beds of Chili. That they have\r\ncome ultimately from the free atmospheric nitrogen seems certain,\r\nand various attempts have been made to explain a method of this\r\nnitrogen fixation. It has been suggested that electrical\r\ndischarges in the air may form nitric acid, which would readily\r\nthen unite with soil ingredients to form nitrates. There is little\r\nreason, however, for believing this to be a very important factor\r\nBut in the soil bacteria we find undoubtedly an efficient agency m\r\nthis nitrogen fixation. As already seen, the bacteria are able to\r\nseize the free atmospheric nitrogen, converting it into nitrite\r\nand nitrates. We have also learned that they can act in connection\r\nwith legumes and some other plants, enabling them to fix\r\natmospheric nitrogen and store it m their roots. By these two\r\nmeans the nitrogen ingredient in the soil is prevented from\r\nbecoming exhausted by the processes of dissipation constantly\r\ngoing on. Further, by some such agency must we imagine the\r\noriginal nitrogen soil ingredient to have been derived. Such an\r\norganic agency is the only one yet discerned which appears to have\r\nbeen efficient in furnishing virgin soil with its nitrates, and we\r\nmust therefore look upon bacteria as essential to the original\r\nfertility of the soil. But in another direction still does the\r\nfarmer depend directly upon bacteria The most important factor in\r\nthe fertility of the soil is the part of it called humus. This\r\nhumus is very complex, and never alike in different soils It\r\ncontains nitrogen compounds in abundance, together with sulphates,\r\nphosphates, sugar, and many other substances. It is this which\r\nmakes the garden soil different from sand, or the rich soil\r\ndifferent from the sterile soil. If the soil is cultivated year\r\nafter year, its food ingredients are slowly but surely exhausted.\r\nSomething is taken from the humus each year, and unless this be\r\nreplaced the soil ceases to be able to support life. To keep up a\r\nconstant yield from the soil the farmer understands that he must\r\napply fertilizers more or less constantly.\r\n\r\nThis application of fertilizers is simply feeding the crops. Some\r\nof these fertilizers the farmer purchases, and knows little or\r\nnothing as to their origin. The most common method of feeding the\r\ncrops is, however, by the use of ordinary barnyard manure. The\r\nreason why this material contains plant food we can understand,\r\nsince it is made of the undigested part of food, together with all\r\nthe urea and other excretions of animals, and contains, therefore,\r\nbesides various minerals, all of the nitrogenous waste of animal\r\nlife. These secretions are not at first fit for plant food. The\r\nfarmer has learned by experience that such excretions, before they\r\nare of any use on his fields, must undergo a process of slow\r\nchange, which is sometimes called ripening. Fresh manure is\r\nsometimes used on the fields, but it is only made use of by the\r\nplants after the ripening process has occurred. Fresh animal\r\nexcretions are of little or no value as a fertilizer. The farmer,\r\ntherefore, commonly allows it to remain in heaps for some time,\r\nand it undergoes a slow change, which gradually converts it into a\r\ncondition in which it can be used by plants. This ripening is\r\nreadily explained by the facts already considered The fresh animal\r\nsecretions consist of various highly complex compounds of\r\nnitrogen, and the ripening is a process of their decomposition.\r\nThe proteids are broken to pieces, and their nitrogen elements\r\nreduced to the form of nitrates, leucin, etc, or even to ammonia\r\nor free nitrogen. Further, a second process occurs, the process of\r\noxidation of these nitrogen compounds already noticed, and the\r\nammonia and nitrites resulting from the decomposition are built\r\ninto nitrates. In short, in this ripening manure the processes\r\nnoticed in the first part of this chapter are taking place, by\r\nwhich the complex nitrogenous bodies are first reduced and then\r\noxidized to form plant food. The ripening of manure is both an\r\nanalytical and a synthetical process. By the analysis, proteids\r\nand other bodies are broken into very simple compounds, some of\r\nthem, indeed, being dissipated into the air, but other portions\r\nare retained and then oxidized, and these latter become the real\r\nfertilizing materials. Through the agency of bacteria the compost\r\nheap thus becomes the great source of plant food to the farmer.\r\nInto this compost heap he throws garbage, straw, vegetable and\r\nanimal substances in general, or any organic refuse which may be\r\nat hand. The various bacteria seize it all, and cause the\r\ndecomposition which converts it into plant food again. The rotting\r\nof the compost heap is thus a gigantic cultivation of bacteria.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge of the ripening process is further teaching the\r\nfarmer how to prevent waste. In the ordinary decomposition of the\r\ncompost heap not an inconsiderable portion of the nitrogen is lost\r\nin the air by dissipation as ammonia or free nitrogen. Even his\r\nnitrates may be thus lost by bacterial action. This portion is\r\nlost to the farmer completely, and he can only hope to replace it\r\neither by purchasing nitrates in the form of commercial\r\nfertilizers, or by reclaiming it from the air by the use of the\r\nbacterial agencies already noticed. With the knowledge now at his\r\ncommand he is learning to prevent this waste. In the decomposition\r\none large factor of loss is the ammonia, which, being a gas, is\r\nreadily dissipated into the air. Knowing this common result of\r\nbacterial action, the scientist has told the farmer that, by\r\nadding certain common chemicals to his decomposing manure heap,\r\nchemicals which will readily unite with ammonia, he may retain\r\nmost of the nitrogen in this heap in the form of ammonia salts,\r\nwhich, once formed, no longer show a tendency to dissipate into\r\nthe air. Ordinary gypsum, or superphosphates, or plaster will\r\nreadily unite with ammonia, and these added to the manure heap\r\nlargely counteract the tendency of the nitrogen to waste, thus\r\nenabling the farmer to put back into his soil most of the nitrogen\r\nwhich was extracted from it by his crops and then used by his\r\nstock. His vegetable crops raise the nitrates into proteids. His\r\nanimals feed upon the proteids, and perform his work or furnish\r\nhim with milk. Then his bacteria stock take the excreted or refuse\r\nnitrogen, and in his manure heap turn it back again into nitrates\r\nready to begin the circle once more. This might go on almost\r\nindefinitely were it not for two facts, the farmer sends\r\nnitrogenous material off his farm in the milk or grains or other\r\nnitrogenous products, which he sells, and the decomposition\r\nprocesses, as we have seen, dissipate some of the nitrogen into\r\nthe air as free nitrogen.\r\n\r\nTo meet this emergency and loss the farmer has another method of\r\nenriching the soil, again depending upon bacteria. This is the so-\r\ncalled green manuring. Here certain plants which seize nitrogen\r\nfrom the air are cultivated upon the field to be fertilized, and,\r\ninstead of harvesting a crop, it is ploughed into the soil. Or\r\nperhaps the tops may be harvested, the rest being ploughed into\r\nthe soil. The vegetable material thus ploughed in lies over a\r\nseason and enriches the soil. Here the bacteria of the soil come\r\ninto play in several directions. First, if the crop sowed be a\r\nlegume, the soil bacteria assist it to seize the nitrogen from the\r\nair. The only plants which are of use in this green manuring are\r\nthose which can, through the agency of bacteria, obtain nitrogen\r\nfrom the air and store it in their roots. Second, after the crop\r\nis ploughed into the soil various decomposing bacteria seize upon\r\nit, pulling the compounds to pieces. The carbon is largely\r\ndissipated into the air as carbonic dioxide, where the next\r\ngeneration of plants can get hold of it. The minerals and the\r\nnitrogen remain in the soil. The nitrogenous portions go through\r\nthe same series of decomposition and synthetical changes already\r\ndescribed, and thus eventually the nitrogen seized from the air by\r\nthe combined action of the legumes and the bacteria is converted\r\ninto nitrates, and will serve for food for the next set of plants\r\ngrown on the same soil. Here is thus a practical method of using\r\nthe nitrogen assimilation powers of bacteria, and reclaiming\r\nnitrogen from the air to replace that which has been lost. Thus it\r\nis that the farmer's nitrogen problem of the fertile soil appears\r\nto resolve itself into a proper handling of bacteria. These\r\norganisms have stocked his soil in the first place. They convert\r\nall of his compost heap wastes into simple bodies, some of which\r\nare changed into plant foods, while others are at the same time\r\nlost. Lastly, they may be made to reclaim this lost nitrogen, and\r\nthe fanner, so soon as he has requisite knowledge of these facts,\r\nwill be able to keep within his control the supply of this\r\nimportant element. The continued fertility of the soil is thus a\r\ngift from the bacteria.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA AS SOURCES OF TROUBLE TO THE FARMER.\r\n\r\nWhile the topics already considered comprise the most important\r\nfactors in agricultural bacteriology, the farmer's relations to\r\nbacteria do not end here. These organisms come incidentally into\r\nhis life in many ways. They are not always his aids as they are in\r\nmost of the instances thus far cited. They produce disease in his\r\ncattle, as will be noticed in the next chapter. Bacteria are\r\nagents of decomposition, and they are just as likely to decompose\r\nmaterial which the farmer wishes to preserve as they are to\r\ndecompose material which the farmer desires to undergo the process\r\nof decay. They are as ready to attack his fruits and vegetables as\r\nto ripen his cream. The skin of fruits and vegetables is a\r\nmoderately good protection of the interior from the attack of\r\nbacteria; but if the skin be broken in any place, bacteria get in\r\nand cause decay, and to prevent it the farmer uses a cold cellar.\r\nThe bacteria prevent the farmer from preserving meats for any\r\nlength of time unless he checks their growth in some way. They get\r\ninto the eggs of his fowls and ruin them. Their troublesome nature\r\nin the dairy in preventing the keeping of milk has already been\r\nnoticed. If he plants his seeds in very moist, damp weather, the\r\nsoil bacteria cause too rapid a decomposition of the seeds and\r\nthey rot in the ground instead of sprouting. They produce\r\ndisagreeable odours, and are the cause of most of the peculiar\r\nsmells, good and bad, around the barn. They attack the organic\r\nmatter which gets into his well or brook or pond, decomposing it,\r\nfilling the water with disagreeable and perhaps poisonous products\r\nwhich render it unfit to drink. They not only aid in the decay of\r\nthe fallen tree in his forests; but in the same way attack the\r\ntimber which he wishes to preserve, especially if it is kept in a\r\nmoist condition. Thus they contribute largely to the gradual\r\ndestruction of wooden structures. It is therefore the presence of\r\nthese organisms which forces him to dry his hay, to smoke his\r\nhams, to corn his beef, to keep his fruits and vegetables cool and\r\nprevent skin bruises, to ice his dairy, to protect his timber from\r\nrain, to use stone instead of wooden foundations for buildings,\r\netc. In general, when the farmer desires to get rid of any organic\r\nrefuse, he depends upon bacteria, for they are his sole agents\r\n(aside from fire) for the final destruction of organic matter.\r\nWhen he wishes to convert waste organic refuse into fertilizing\r\nmaterial, he uses the bacteria of his compost heap. On the other\r\nhand, whenever he desires to preserve organic material, the\r\nbacteria are the enemies against which he must carefully guard.\r\n\r\nThus the farmer's life from year's end to year's end is in most\r\nintimate association with bacteria. Upon them he depends to insure\r\nthe continued fertility of his soil and the constant continued\r\nproduction of good crops. Upon them he depends to turn into plant\r\nfood all the organic refuse from his house or from his barn. Upon\r\nthem he depends to replenish his stock of nitrogen. It is these\r\norganisms which furnish his dairy with its butter flavours and\r\nwith the taste of its cheese. But, on the other hand, against them\r\nhe must be constantly alert. All his food products must be\r\nprotected from their ravages. A successful farmer's life, then,\r\nlargely resolves itself into a skilful management of bacterial\r\nactivity. To aid them in destroying or decomposing everything\r\nwhich he does not desire to preserve, and to prevent their\r\ndestroying the organic material which he wishes to keep for future\r\nuse, is the object of a considerable portion of farm labour; and\r\nthe most successful farmer to-day, and we believe the most\r\nsuccessful farmer of the future, is the one who most intelligently\r\nand skilfully manipulates these gigantic forces furnished him by\r\nthe growth of his microscopical allies.\r\n\r\nRELATION OF BACTERIA TO COAL. Another one of Nature's processes in\r\nwhich bacteria have played an important part is in the formation\r\nof coal. It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of coal in\r\nmodern civilization. Aside from its use as fuel, upon which\r\ncivilization is dependent, coal is a source of an endless variety\r\nof valuable products. It is the source of our illuminating gas,\r\nand ammonia is one of the products of the gas manufacture. From\r\nthe coal also comes coal tar, the material from which such a long\r\nseries of valuable materials, as aniline colours, carbolic acid,\r\netc, is derived. The list of products which we owe to coal is very\r\nlong, and the value of this material is hardly to be overrated. In\r\nthe preparation of these ingredients from coal bacteria do not\r\nplay any part. Most of them are derived by means of distillation.\r\nBut when asked for the agents which have given us the coal of the\r\ncoal beds, we shall find that here, too, we owe a great debt to\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nCoal, as is well known, has come from the accumulation of the\r\nluxuriant vegetable growth of the past geological ages. It has\r\ntherefore been directly furnished us by the vegetation of the\r\ngreen plants of the past, and, in general, it represents so much\r\ncarbonic dioxide which these plants have extracted from the\r\natmosphere. But while the green plants have been the active agents\r\nin producing this assimilation, bacteria have played an important\r\npart in coal manufacture in two different directions. The first\r\nappears to be in furnishing these plants with nitrogen. Without a\r\nstore of fixed nitrogen in the soil these carboniferous plants\r\ncould not have grown. This matter has already been considered. We\r\nhave no very absolute knowledge as to the agency of bacteria in\r\nfurnishing nitrogen for this vegetation in past ages, but there is\r\nevery reason to believe that in the past, as in the present, the\r\nchief source of organic nitrogen has been from the atmosphere and\r\nderived from the atmosphere through the agency of bacteria. In the\r\nabsence of any other known factor we may be pretty safe in the\r\nassumption that bacteria played an important part in this nitrogen\r\nfixation, and that bacteria must therefore be regarded as the\r\nagents which have furnished us the nitrogen stored in the coal.\r\n\r\nBut in a later stage of coal formation bacteria have contributed\r\nmore directly to the formation of coal. Coal is not simply\r\naccumulated vegetation. The coal of our coal beds is very\r\ndifferent in its chemical composition from the wood of the trees.\r\nIt contains a much higher percentage of carbon and a lower\r\npercentage of hydrogen and oxygen than ordinary vegetable\r\nsubstances. The conversion of the vegetation of the carboniferous\r\nages into coal was accompanied by a gradual loss of hydrogen and a\r\nconsequent increase in the percentage of carbon. It is this change\r\nthat has added to the density of the substance and makes the\r\ngreater value of coal as fuel. There is little doubt now as to the\r\nmethod by which this woody material of the past has been converted\r\ninto coal. The same process appears to be going on in a similar\r\nmanner to-day in the peat beds of various northern countries. The\r\nfallen vegetation, trees, trunks, branches, and leaves, accumulate\r\nin masses, and, when the conditions of moisture and temperature\r\nare right, begin to undergo a fermentation. Ordinarily this action\r\nof bacteria, as already noticed, produces an almost complete\r\nthough slow oxidation of the carbon, and results in the total\r\ndecay of the vegetable matter. But if the vegetable mass be\r\ncovered by water and mud under proper conditions of moisture and\r\ntemperature, a different kind of fermentation arises which does\r\nnot produce such complete decay. The covering of water prevents\r\nthe access of oxygen to the fermenting mass, an oxidation of the\r\ncarbon is largely prevented, and the vegetable matter slowly\r\nchanges its character. Under the influence of this slow\r\nfermentation, aided, probably by pressure, the mass becomes more\r\nand more solid and condensed, its woody character becomes less and\r\nless distinct, and there is a gradual loss of the hydrogen and the\r\noxygen. Doubtless there is a loss of carbon also, for there is an\r\nevolution of marsh gas which contains carbon. But, in this slow\r\nfermentation taking place under the water in peat bogs and marshes\r\nthe carbon loss is relatively small; the woody material does not\r\nbecome completely oxidized, as it does in free operations of\r\ndecay. The loss of hydrogen and oxygen from the mass is greater\r\nthan that of carbon, and the percentage of carbon therefore\r\nincreases. This is not the ordinary kind of fermentation that goes\r\non in vegetable accumulations. It requires special conditions and\r\npossibly special kinds of fermenting organisms. Peat is not formed\r\nin all climates. In warm regions, or where the woody matter is\r\nfreely exposed to the air, the fermentation of vegetable matter is\r\nmore complete, and it is entirely destroyed by oxidation. It is\r\nonly in colder regions and when covered with water that the\r\ndestruction of the organic matter stops short of decay. But such\r\nincomplete fermentation is still going on in many parts of the\r\nworld, and by its means vegetable accumulations are being\r\nconverted into peat.\r\n\r\nThis formation of peat appears to be a first step in the formation\r\nof denser coal. By a continuation of the same processes the mass\r\nbecomes still more dense and solid. As we pass from the top to the\r\nbottom of such an accumulation of peat, we find it becoming denser\r\nand denser, and at the bottom it is commonly of a hard consistence,\r\nbrownish in colour, and with only slight traces of the\r\noriginal woody structure. Such material is called lignite. It\r\ncontains a higher percentage of carbon than peat, but a lower\r\npercentage than coal, and is plainly a step in coal formation. But\r\nthe process goes on, the hydrogen and oxygen loss continuing until\r\nthere is finally produced true coal.\r\n\r\nIf this is the correct understanding of the formation of coal, we\r\nsee that we have plainly a process in which bacterial life has had\r\na large and important share. We are, of course, densely ignorant\r\nof the exact processes going on. We know nothing positively as to\r\nthe kind of microorganisms which produce this slow, peculiar\r\nfermentation. As yet, the fermentation going on in the formation\r\nof the peat has not been studied by the bacteriologists, and we do\r\nnot know from direct experiment that it is a matter of bacterial\r\naction. It has been commonly regarded as simply a slow chemical\r\nchange, but its general similarity to other fermentative processes\r\nis so great that we can have little hesitation in attributing it\r\nto micro-organisms, and doubtless to some forms of plants allied\r\nto bacteria. There is no reason for doubting that bacteria existed\r\nin the geological ages with essentially the same powers as they\r\nnow possess, and to some forms of bacteria which grow in the\r\nabsence of oxygen can we probably attribute the slow change which\r\nhas produced coal. Here, then, is another great source of wealth\r\nin Nature for which we are dependent upon bacteria. While, of\r\ncourse, water and pressure were very essential factors in the\r\ndeposition of coal, it was a peculiar kind of fermentation\r\noccurring in the vegetation that brought about the chemical\r\nchanges in it which resulted in its transformation into coal. The\r\nvegetation of the carboniferous age was dependent upon the\r\nnitrogen fixed by the bacteria, and to these organisms also do we\r\nowe the fact that this vegetation was stored for us in the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPARASITIC BACTERIA AND THEIR RELATION TO DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most universally known fact in regard to bacteria is\r\nthat they are the cause of disease. It is this fact that has made\r\nthem objects of such wide interest. This is the side of the\r\nsubject that first attracted attention, has been most studied, and\r\nin regard to which there has been the greatest accumulation of\r\nevidence. So persistently has the relation of bacteria to disease\r\nbeen discussed and emphasized that the majority of readers are\r\nhardly able to disassociate the two. To most people the very word\r\nbacteria is almost equivalent to disease, and the thought of\r\nswallowing microbes in drinking water or milk is decidedly\r\nrepugnant and alarming. In the public mind it is only necessary to\r\ndemonstrate that an article holds bacteria to throw it under\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that bacteria are to be regarded as agents\r\nfor good, and that from their fundamental relation to plant life\r\nthey must be looked upon as our friends rather than as our\r\nenemies. It is true that there is another side to the story which\r\nrelates to the parasitic species. These parasitic forms may do us\r\ndirect or indirect injury. But the species of bacteria which are\r\ncapable of doing us any injury, the pathogenic bacteria, are\r\nreally very few compared to the great host of species which are\r\nharmless. A small number of species, perhaps a score or two, are\r\npathogenic, while a much larger number, amounting to hundreds and\r\nperhaps thousands of species, are perfectly harmless. This latter\r\nclass do no injury even though swallowed by man in thousands. They\r\nare not parasitic, and are unable to grow in the body of man.\r\nTheir presence is entirely consistent with the most perfect\r\nhealth, and, indeed, there are some reasons for believing that\r\nthey are sometimes directly beneficial to health. It is entirely\r\nunjust to condemn all bacteria because a few chance to produce\r\nmischief. Bacteria in general are agents for good rather than ill.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some species which cause mankind much trouble\r\nby interfering in one way or another with the normal processes of\r\nlife. These pathogenic bacteria, or disease germs, do not all act\r\nalike, but bring about injury to man in a number of different\r\nways. We may recognise two different classes among them, which,\r\nhowever, we shall see are connected by intermediate types. These\r\ntwo classes are, first, the pathogenic bacteria, which are not\r\nstrictly parasitic but live free in Nature; and, second, those\r\nwhich live as true parasites in the bodies of man or other\r\nanimals. To understand the real relation of these two classes, we\r\nmust first notice the method by which bacteria in general produce\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nMETHOD BY WHICH BACTERIA PRODUCE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nSince it was first clearly recognised that certain species of\r\nbacteria have the power of producing disease, the question as to\r\nhow they do so has ever been a prominent one Even if they do grow\r\nin the body, why should their presence give rise to the symptoms\r\ncharacterizing disease? Various answers to this question have been\r\ngiven in the past It has been suggested that in their growth they\r\nconsume the food of the body and thus exhaust it, that they\r\nproduce an oxidation of the body tissues, or that they produce a\r\nreduction of these tissues, or that they mechanically interfere\r\nwith the circulation None of these suggestions have proved of much\r\nvalue Another view was early advanced, and has stood the test of\r\ntime. This claim is that the bacteria while growing in the body\r\nproduce poisons, and these poisons then have a direct action on\r\nthe body We have already noticed that bacteria during their growth\r\nin any medium produce a large number of biproducts of\r\ndecomposition. We noticed also that among these biproducts there\r\nare some which have a poisonous nature; so poisonous are they that\r\nwhen inoculated into the body of an animal they may produce\r\npoisoning and death. We have only to suppose that the pathogenic\r\nbacteria, when growing as parasites in man, produce such poisons,\r\nand we have at once an explanation of the method by which they\r\ngive rise to disease.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of germ disease is more than simple theory. It\r\nhas been in many cases clearly demonstrated. It has been found\r\nthat the bacteria which cause diphtheria, tetanus, typhoid,\r\ntuberculosis, and many other diseases, produce, even when growing\r\nin common culture media, poisons which are of a very violent\r\nnature. These poisons when inoculated into the bodies of animals\r\ngive rise to much the same symptoms as the bacteria do themselves\r\nwhen growing as parasites in the animals. The chief difference in\r\nthe results from inoculating an animal with the poison and with\r\nthe living bacteria is in the rapidity of the action. When the\r\npoison is injected the poisoning symptoms are almost immediately\r\nseen, but when the living bacteria are inoculated the effect is\r\nonly seen after several days or longer, not, in short, until the\r\ninoculated bacteria have had time enough to grow in the body and\r\nproduce the poison in quantity. It has not by any means been shown\r\nthat all pathogenic germs produce their effect in this way, but it\r\nhas been proved to be the real method in quite a number of cases,\r\nand is extremely probable in others. While some bacteria perhaps\r\nproduce results by a different method, we must recognise the\r\nproduction of poisons as at all events the common direct cause of\r\nthe symptoms of disease. This explanation will enable us more\r\nclearly to understand the relation of different bacteria to\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nPATHOGENIC GERMS WHICH ARE NOT STRICTLY PARASITIC\r\n\r\nRecognising that bacteria may produce poisons, we readily see that\r\nit is not always necessary that they should be parasites in order\r\nto produce trouble. In their ordinary growth in Nature such\r\nbacteria will produce no trouble The poisons will be produced in\r\ndecaying material but will seldom be taken into the human body.\r\nThese poisons, produced in the first stages of putrefaction, are\r\noxidized by further stages of decomposition into harmless\r\nproducts. But should it happen that some of these bacteria\r\nobtained a chance to grow vigorously for a while in organic\r\nproducts that are subsequently swallowed as man's food, it is\r\nplain that evil results might follow. If such food is swallowed by\r\nman after the bacteria have produced their poisonous bodies, it\r\nwill tend to produce an immediate poisoning of his system. The\r\neffect may be sudden and severe if considerable quantity of the\r\npoisonous material is swallowed, or slight but protracted if small\r\nquantities are repeatedly consumed in food. Such instances are not\r\nuncommon. Well-known examples are cases of ice-cream poisoning,\r\npoisoning from eating cheese or from drinking milk, or in not a\r\nfew instances from eating fish or meats within which bacteria have\r\nhad opportunity for growth. In all these cases the poison is\r\nswallowed in quantity sufficient to give rise quickly to severe\r\nsymptoms, sometimes resulting fatally, and at other times passing\r\noff as soon as the body succeeds in throwing off the poisons. In\r\nother cases still, however, the amount of poison swallowed may be\r\nvery slight, too slight to produce much effect unless the same be\r\nconsumed repeatedly. All such trouble may be attributed to\r\nfermented or partly decayed food. It is difficult to distinguish\r\nsuch instances from others produced in a slightly different way,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nIt may happen that the bacteria which grow in food products\r\ncontinue to grow in the food even after it is swallowed and has\r\npassed into the stomach or intestines. This appears particularly\r\ntrue of milk bacteria. Under these conditions the bacteria are not\r\nin any proper sense parasitic, since they are simply living in and\r\nfeeding upon the same food which they consume outside the body,\r\nand are not feeding upon the tissues of man. The poisons which\r\nthey produce will continue to be developed as long as the bacteria\r\ncontinue to grow, whether in a milk pail or a human stomach. If\r\nnow the poisons are absorbed by the body, they may produce a mild\r\nor severe disease which will be more or less lasting, continuing\r\nperhaps as long as the same food and the same bacteria are\r\nsupplied to the individual. The most important disease of this\r\nclass appears to be the dreaded cholera infantum, so common among\r\ninfants who feed upon cow's milk in warm weather. It is easy to\r\nunderstand the nature of this disease when we remember the great\r\nnumber of bacteria in milk, especially in hot weather, and when we\r\nremember that the delicate organism of the infant will be thrown\r\nat once into disorder by slight amounts of poison which would have\r\nno appreciable effect upon the stronger adult. We can easily\r\nunderstand, further, how the disease readily yields to treatment\r\nif care is taken to sterilize the milk given to the patient.\r\n\r\nWe do not know to-day the extent of the troubles which are\r\nproduced by bacteria of this sort. They will, of course, be\r\nchiefly connected with our food products, and commonly, though not\r\nalways, will affect the digestive functions. It is probable that\r\nmany of the cases of summer diarrhoea are produced by some such\r\ncause, and if they could be traced to their source would be found\r\nto be produced by bacterial poisons swallowed with food or drink,\r\nor by similar poisons produced by bacteria growing in such food\r\nafter it is swallowed by the individual. In hot weather, when\r\nbacteria are so abundant everywhere and growing so rapidly, it is\r\nimpossible to avoid such dangers completely without exercising\r\nover all food a guard which would be decidedly oppressive. It is\r\nwell to bear in mind, however, that the most common and most\r\ndangerous source of such poisons is milk or its products, and for\r\nthis reason one should hesitate to drink milk in hot weather\r\nunless it is either quite fresh or has been boiled to destroy its\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nPATHOGENIC BACTERIA WHICH ARE TRUE PARASITES.\r\n\r\nThis class of pathogenic bacteria includes those which actually\r\ninvade the body and feed upon its tissues instead of living simply\r\nupon swallowed food. It is difficult, however, to draw any sharp\r\nline separating the two classes. The bacteria which cause\r\ndiphtheria (Fig. 28), for instance, do not really invade the body.\r\nThey grow in the throat, attached to its walls, and are confined\r\nto this external location or to the superficial tissues. This\r\nbacillus is, in short, only found in the mouth and throat, and is\r\npractically confined to the so-called false membranes. It never\r\nenters any of the tissues of the body, although attached to the\r\nmucous membrane. It grows vigorously in this membrane, and there\r\nsecretes or in some way produces extremely violent poisons. These\r\npoisons are then absorbed by the body and give rise to the general\r\nsymptoms of the disease. Much the same is true of the bacillus\r\nwhich causes tetanus or lockjaw (Fig. 29). This bacillus is\r\ncommonly inoculated into the flesh of the victim by a wound made\r\nwith some object which has been lying upon the earth where the\r\nbacillus lives. The bacillus grows readily after being inoculated,\r\nbut it is localized at the point of the wound, without invading\r\nthe tissue to any extent. It produces, however, during its growth\r\nseveral poisons which have been separated and studied. Among them\r\nare some of the most violent poisons of which we have any\r\nknowledge. While the bacillus grows in the tissues around the\r\nwound it secretes these poisons, which are then absorbed by the\r\nbody generally. Their poisoning effects produce the violent\r\nsymptoms of the disease. Of much the same nature is Asiatic\r\ncholera. This is caused by a bacillus which is able to grow\r\nrapidly in the intestines, feeding perhaps in part on the food in\r\nthe intestines and perhaps in part upon the body secretions. To a\r\nslight extent also it appears to be able to invade the tissues of\r\nthe body, for the bacilli are found in the walls of the\r\nintestines. But it is not a proper parasite, and the fatal disease\r\nit produces is the result of the absorption of the poisons\r\nsecreted in the intestines.\r\n\r\nIt is but a step from this to the true parasites. Typhoid fever,\r\nfor example, is a disease produced by bacteria which grow in the\r\nintestines, but which also invade the tissues more extensively\r\nthan the cholera germs (Fig. 30). They do not invade the body\r\ngenerally, however, but become somewhat localized in special\r\nglands like the liver, the spleen, etc. Even here they do not\r\nappear to find a very favourable condition, for they do not grow\r\nextensively in these places. They are likely to be found in the\r\nspleen in small groups or centres, but not generally distributed\r\nthrough it. Wherever they grow they produce poison, which has been\r\ncalled typhotoxine, and it is this poison chiefly which gives rise\r\nto the fever.\r\n\r\nQuite a considerable number of the pathogenic germs are, like the\r\ntyphoid bacillus, more or less confined to special places. Instead\r\nof distributing themselves through the body after they find\r\nentrance, they are restricted to special organs. The most common\r\nexample of a parasite of this sort is the tuberculosis bacillus,\r\nthe cause of consumption, scrofula, white swelling, lupus, etc.\r\n(Fig. 31). Although this bacillus is very common and is able to\r\nattack almost any organ in the body, it is usually very restricted\r\nin growth. It may become localized in a small gland, a single\r\njoint, a small spot in the lungs, or in the glands of the\r\nmesentery, the other parts of the body remaining free from\r\ninfection. Not infrequently the whole trouble is thus confined to\r\nsuch a small locality that nothing serious results. But in other\r\ninstances the bacilli may after a time slowly or rapidly\r\ndistribute themselves from these centres, attacking more and more\r\nof the body until perhaps fatal results follow in the end. This\r\ndisease is therefore commonly of very slow progress.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have still other parasites which are not thus confined,\r\nbut which, as soon as they enter the body, produce a general\r\ninfection, attacking the blood and perhaps nearly all tissues\r\nsimultaneously. The most typical example of this sort is anthrax\r\nor malignant pustule, a disease fortunately rare in man (Fig. 32).\r\nHere the bacilli multiply in the blood, and very soon a general\r\nand fatal infection of the whole body arises, resulting from the\r\nabundance of the bacilli everywhere. Some of the obscure diseases\r\nknown as blood poisoning appear to be of the same general nature,\r\nthese diseases resulting from a very general invasion of the whole\r\nbody by certain pathogenic bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn general, then, we see that the so-called germ diseases result\r\nfrom the action upon the body of poisons produced by bacterial\r\ngrowth. Differences in the nature of these poisons produce\r\ndifferences in the character of the disease, and differences in\r\nthe parasitic powers of the different species of bacteria produce\r\nwide differences in the course of the diseases and their relation\r\nto external phenomena.\r\n\r\nWHAT DISEASES ARE DUE TO BACTERIA?\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, an extremely important matter to determine to\r\nwhat extent human diseases are caused by bacteria. It is not easy,\r\nnor indeed possible, to do this to-day with accuracy. It is no\r\neasy matter to prove that any particular disease is caused by\r\nbacteria. To do this it is necessary to find some particular\r\nbacterium present in all cases of the disease; to find some method\r\nof getting it to grow outside the body in culture media; to\r\ndemonstrate its absence in healthy animals, or healthy human\r\nindividuals if it be a human disease; and, finally, to reproduce\r\nthe disease in healthy animals by inoculating them with the\r\nbacterium. All of these steps of proof present difficulties, but\r\nespecially the last one. In the study of animals it is\r\ncomparatively easy to reproduce a disease by inoculation. But\r\nexperiments upon man are commonly impossible, and in the case of\r\nhuman diseases it is frequently very difficult or impossible to\r\nobtain the final test of the matter. After finding a specific\r\nbacterium associated with a disease, it is usually possible to\r\nexperiment with it further upon animals only. But some human\r\ndiseases do not attack animals, and in the case of diseases that\r\nmay be given to animals it is frequently uncertain whether the\r\ndisease produced in the animal by such inoculation is identical\r\nwith the human disease in question, owing to the difference of\r\nsymptoms in the different animals. As a consequence, the proof of\r\nthe germ nature of different diseases varies all the way from\r\nabsolute demonstration to mere suspicion. To give a complete and\r\ncorrect list of the diseases caused by bacteria, or to give a list\r\nof the bacteria species pathogenic to man, is therefore at present\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of giving such a list is rendered greater from the\r\nfact that we have in recent years learned that the same species of\r\npathogenic bacterium may produce different results under different\r\nconditions. When the subject of germ disease was first studied and\r\nthe connection between bacteria and disease was first\r\ndemonstrated, it was thought that each particular species of\r\npathogenic bacteria produced a single definite disease; and\r\nconversely, each germ disease was supposed to have its own\r\ndefinite species of bacterium as its cause. Recent study has\r\nshown, however, that this is not wholly true. It is true that some\r\ndiseases do have such a definite relation to definite bacteria.\r\nThe anthrax germ, for example, will always produce anthrax, no\r\nmatter where or how it is inoculated into the body. So, also, in\r\nquite a number of other cases distinct specific bacteria are\r\nassociated with distinct diseases. But, on the other hand, there\r\nare some pathogenic bacteria which are not so definite in their\r\naction, and produce different results in accordance with\r\ncircumstances, the effect varying both with the organ attacked and\r\nwith the condition of the individual. For instance, a considerable\r\nnumber of different types of blood poisoning, septicaemia,\r\npyaemia, gangrene, inflammation of wounds, or formation of pus\r\nfrom slight skin wounds--indeed, a host of miscellaneous troubles,\r\nranging all the way from a slight pus formation to a violent and\r\nsevere blood poisoning--all appear to be caused by bacteria, and\r\nit is impossible to make out any definite species associated with\r\nthe different types of these troubles. There are three common\r\nforms of so-called pus cocci, and these are found almost\r\nindiscriminately with various types of inflammatory troubles.\r\nMoreover, these species of bacteria are found with almost absolute\r\nconstancy in and around the body, even in health. They are on the\r\nclothing, on the skin, in the mouth and alimentary canal. Here\r\nthey exist, commonly doing no harm. They have, however, the power\r\nof doing injury if by chance they get into wounds. But their power\r\nof doing injury varies both with the condition of the individual\r\nand with variations in the bacteria themselves. If the individual\r\nis in a good condition of health these bacteria have little power\r\nof injuring him even when they do get into such wounds, while at\r\ntimes of feeble vitality they may do much more injury, and take\r\nthe occasion of any little cut or bruise to enter under the skin\r\nand give rise to inflammation and pus. Some people will develop\r\nslight abscesses or slight inflammations whenever the skin is\r\nbruised, while with others such bruises or cuts heal at once\r\nwithout trouble. Both are doubtless subject to the same chance of\r\ninfection, but the one resists, while the other does not. In\r\ncommon parlance, we say that such a tendency to abscesses\r\nindicates a bad condition of the blood--a phrase which means\r\nnothing. Further, we find that the same species of bacterium may\r\nhave varying powers of producing disease at different times. Some\r\nspecies are universal inhabitants of the alimentary canal and are\r\nordinarily harmless, while under other conditions of unknown\r\ncharacter they invade the tissues and give rise to a serious and\r\nperhaps fatal disease. We may thus recognise some bacteria which\r\nmay be compared to foreign invaders, while others are domestic\r\nenemies. The former, like the typhoid bacillus, always produce\r\ntrouble when they succeed in entering the body and finding a\r\nfoothold. The latter, like the normal intestinal bacilli, are\r\nalways present but commonly harmless, only under special\r\nconditions becoming troublesome. All this shows that there are\r\nother factors in determining the course of a disease, or even the\r\nexistence of a disease, than the simple presence of a peculiar\r\nspecies of pathogenic bacterium.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts just stated it will be evident that any list of\r\ngerm diseases will be rather uncertain. Still, the studies of the\r\nlast twenty years or more have disclosed some definite relations\r\nof bacteria and disease, and a list of the diseases more or less\r\ndefinitely associated with distinct species of bacteria is of\r\ninterest. Such a list, including only well-known diseases, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n Name of disease.              Name of bacterium producing the disease.\r\n Anthrax (Malignant pustule).     Bacillus anthracis.\r\n Cholera.                         Spirillum cholera: asiaticae\r\n Croupous pneumonia.              Micrococcus pneumonia crouposa.\r\n Diphtheria.                      Bacillus diphtheria.\r\n Glanders.                        Bacillus mallei.\r\n Gonorrhoea.                      Micrococcus gonorrhaeae\r\n Influenza.                       Bacillus of influenza.\r\n Leprosy.                         Bacillus leprae.\r\n Relapsing fever.                 Spirillum Obermeieri.\r\n Tetanus (lockjaw).               Bacillus tetani.\r\n Tuberculosis (including\r\n consumption, scrofula, etc.)     Bacillus tuberculosis.\r\n Typhoid fever.                   Bacillus typhi abdominalis.\r\n\r\nVarious wound infections, including septicaemia, pyaemia, acute\r\nabscesses, ulcers, erysipelas, etc., are produced by a few forms\r\nof micrococci, resembling each other in many points but differing\r\nslightly. They are found almost indiscriminately in any of these\r\nwound infections, and none of them appears to have any definite\r\nrelation to any special form of disease unless it be the\r\nmicrococcus of erysipelas. The common pus micrococci are grouped\r\nunder three species, Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus,\r\nStaphylococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pyogenes. These three\r\nare the most common, but others are occasionally found.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, which may be regarded as demonstrated, the\r\nfollowing diseases are with more or less certainty regarded as\r\ncaused by distinct specific bacteria: Bronchitis, endocarditis,\r\nmeasles, whooping-cough, peritonitis, pneumonia, syphilis.\r\n\r\nStill another list might be given of diseases whose general nature\r\nindicates that they are caused by bacteria, but in connection with\r\nwhich no distinct bacterium has yet been found. As might be\r\nexpected also, a larger list of animal diseases has been\r\ndemonstrated to be caused by these organisms. In addition, quite a\r\nnumber of species of bacteria have been found in such material as\r\nfaeces, putrefying blood, etc., which have been shown by\r\nexperiment to be capable of producing diseases in animals, but in\r\nregard to which we have no evidence that they ever do produce\r\nactual disease under any normal conditions. These may contribute,\r\nperhaps, to the troubles arising from poisonous foods, but can not\r\nbe regarded as disease germs proper.\r\n\r\nVARIABILITY OF PATHOGENIC POWERS.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, our ideas of the relation of bacteria\r\nto disease have undergone quite a change since they were first\r\nformulated, and we recognise other factors influencing disease\r\nbesides the actual presence of the bacterium. These we may briefly\r\nconsider under two heads, viz., variation in the bacterium, and\r\nvariation in the susceptibility of the individual. The first will\r\nrequire only a brief consideration.\r\n\r\nThat the same species of pathogenic bacteria at different times\r\nvaries in its powers to produce disease has long been known.\r\nVarious conditions are known to affect thus the virulence of\r\nbacteria. The bacillus which is supposed to give rise to pneumonia\r\nloses its power to produce the disease after having been\r\ncultivated for a short time in ordinary culture media in the\r\nlaboratory. This is easily understood upon the suggestion that it\r\nis a parasitic bacillus and does not thrive except under parasitic\r\nconditions. Its pathogenic powers can sometimes be restored by\r\npassing it again through some susceptible animal. One of the most\r\nviolent pathogenic bacteria is that which produces anthrax, but\r\nthis loses its pathogenic powers if it is cultivated for a\r\nconsiderable period at a high temperature. The micrococcus which\r\ncauses fowl cholera loses its power if it be cultivated in common\r\nculture media, care being taken to allow several days to elapse\r\nbetween the successive inoculations into new culture flasks. Most\r\npathogenic bacteria can in some way be so treated as to suffer a\r\ndiminution or complete loss of their powers of producing a fatal\r\ndisease. On the other hand, other conditions will cause an\r\nincrease in the virulence of a pathogenic germ. The virus which\r\nproduces hydrophobia is increased in violence if it is inoculated\r\ninto a rabbit and subsequently taken from the rabbit for further\r\ninoculation. The fowl cholera micrococcus, which has been weakened\r\nas just mentioned, may be restored to its original violence by\r\ninoculating it into a small bird, like a sparrow, and inoculating\r\na second bird from this. A few such inoculations will make it as\r\nactive as ever. These variations doubtless exist among the species\r\nin Nature as well as in artificial cultures. The bacteria which\r\nproduce the various wound infections and abscesses, etc., appear\r\nto vary under normal conditions from a type capable of producing\r\nviolent and fatal blood poisoning to a type producing only a\r\nsimple abscess, or even to a type that is entirely innocuous. It\r\nis this factor, doubtless, which in a large measure determines the\r\nseverity of any epidemic of a bacterial contagious disease.\r\n\r\nSUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL.\r\n\r\nThe very great modification of our early views has affected our\r\nideas as to the power which individuals have of resisting the\r\ninvasion of pathogenic bacteria. It has from the first been\r\nunderstood that some individuals are more susceptible to disease\r\nthan others, and in attempting to determine the significance of\r\nthis fact many valuable and interesting discoveries have been\r\nmade. After the exposure to the disease there follows a period of\r\nsome length in which there are no discernible effects. This is\r\nfollowed by the onset of the disease and its development to a\r\ncrisis, and, if this be passed, by a recovery. The general course\r\nof a germ disease is divided into three stages: the stage of\r\nincubation, the development of the disease, and the recovery. The\r\nsusceptibility of the body to a disease may be best considered\r\nunder the three heads of Invasion, Resistance, Recovery.\r\n\r\nMeans of Invasion.--In order that a germ disease should arise in\r\nan individual, it is first necessary that the special bacterium\r\nwhich causes the disease should get into the body. There are\r\nseveral channels through which bacteria can thus find entrance;\r\nthese are through the mouth, through the nose, through the skin,\r\nand occasionally through excretory ducts. Those which come through\r\nthe mouth come with the food or drink which we swallow; those\r\nwhich enter through the nose must be traced to the air; and those\r\nwhich enter through the skin come in most cases through contact\r\nwith some infected object, such as direct contact with the body of\r\nan infected person or his clothing or some objects he has handled,\r\netc. Occasionally, perhaps, the bacteria may get into the skin\r\nfrom the air, but this is certainly uncommon and confined to a few\r\ndiseases. There are here two facts of the utmost importance for\r\nevery one to understand: first, that the chance of disease\r\nbacteria being carried to us through the air is very slight and\r\nconfined to a few diseases, such as smallpox, tuberculosis,\r\nscarlet fever; etc., and, secondly, that the uninjured skin and\r\nthe uninjured mucous membrane also is almost a sure protection\r\nagainst the invasion of the bacteria. If the skin is whole,\r\nwithout bruises or cuts, bacteria can seldom, if ever, find\r\npassage through it. These two facts are of the utmost importance,\r\nsince of all sources of infection we have the least power to guard\r\nagainst infection through the air, and since of all means 'of\r\nentrance we can guard the skin with the greatest difficulty. We\r\ncan easily render food free from pathogenic bacteria by heating\r\nit. The material we drink can similarly be rendered harmless, but\r\nwe can not by any known means avoid breathing air, nor is there\r\nany known method of disinfecting the air, and it is impossible for\r\nthose who have anything to do with sick persons to avoid entirely\r\nhaving contact either with the patient or with infected clothing\r\nor utensils.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts here given it will be seen that the individual's\r\nsusceptibility to disease produced by parasitic bacteria will\r\ndepend upon his habits of cleanliness, his care in handling\r\ninfectious material, or care in cleansing the hands after such\r\nhandling, upon his habit of eating food cooked or raw, and upon\r\nthe condition of his skin and mucous membranes, since any kind of\r\nbruises will increase susceptibility. Slight ailments, such as\r\ncolds, which inflame the mucous membrane, will decrease its\r\nresisting power and render the individual more susceptible to the\r\nentrance of any pathogenic germs should they happen to be present.\r\nSores in the mouth or decayed teeth may in the same way be\r\nprominent factors in the individual's susceptibility. Thus quite a\r\nnumber of purely physical factors may contribute to an\r\nindividual's susceptibility.\r\n\r\nResisting Power of the Body.--Even after the bacteria get into the\r\nbody it is by no means certain that they will give rise to\r\ndisease, for they have now a battle to fight before they can be\r\nsure of holding their own. It is now, indeed, that the actual\r\nconflict between the powers of the body and these microscopic\r\ninvaders begins. After they have found entrance into the body the\r\nbacteria have arrayed against them strong resisting forces of the\r\nhuman organism, endeavouring to destroy and expel them. Many of\r\nthem are rapidly killed, and sometimes they are all destroyed\r\nwithout being able to gain a foothold. In such cases, of course,\r\nno trouble results. In other cases the body fails to overcome the\r\npowers of the invaders and they eventually multiply rapidly. In\r\nthis struggle the success of the invaders is not necessarily a\r\nmatter of numbers. They are simply struggling to gain a position\r\nin the body, where they can feed and grow. A few individuals may\r\nbe entirely sufficient to seize such a foothold, and then these by\r\nmultiplying may soon become indefinitely numerous. To protect\r\nitself, therefore, the human body must destroy every individual\r\nbacterium, or at least render them all incapable of growth. Their\r\nmarvellous reproductive powers give the bacteria an advantage in\r\nthe battle. On the other hand, it takes time even for these\r\nrapidly multiplying beings to become sufficiently numerous to do\r\ninjury. There is thus an interval after their penetration into the\r\nbody when these invaders are weak in numbers. During this\r\ninterval--the period of incubation--the body may organize a\r\nresistance sufficient to expel them.\r\n\r\nWe do not as yet thoroughly understand the forces which the human\r\norganism is able to array against these invading foes. Some of its\r\nmethods of defence are, however, already intelligible to us, and\r\nwe know enough, at all events, to give us an idea of the intensity\r\nof the conflict that is going on, and of the vigorous and powerful\r\nforces which the human organism is able to bring against its\r\ninvading enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we notice that a majority of bacteria are\r\nutterly unable to grow in the human body even if they do find\r\nentrance. There are known to bacteriologists to-day many hundreds,\r\neven thousands of species, but the vast majority of these find in\r\nthe human tissues conditions so hostile to their life that they\r\nare utterly unable to grow therein. Human flesh or human blood\r\nwill furnish excellent food for them if the individual be dead,\r\nbut living human flesh and blood in some way exerts a repressing\r\ninfluence upon them which is fatal to the growth of a vast\r\nmajority of species. Some few species, however, are not thus\r\ndestroyed by the hostile agencies of the tissues of the animal,\r\nbut are capable of growing and multiplying in the living body.\r\nThese alone are what constitute the pathogenic bacteria, since, of\r\ncourse, these are the only bacteria which can produce disease by\r\ngrowing in the tissues of an animal. The fact that the vast\r\nmajority of bacteria can not grow in the living organism shows\r\nclearly enough that there are some conditions existing in the\r\nliving tissue hostile to bacterial life. There can be little\r\ndoubt, moreover, that it is these same hostile conditions, which\r\nenable the body to resist the attack of the pathogenic species in\r\ncases where resistance is successfully made.\r\n\r\nWhat are the forces arrayed against these invaders? The essential\r\nnature of the battle appears to be a production of poisons and\r\ncounter poisons. It appears to be an undoubted fact that the first\r\nstep in repelling these bacteria is to flood them with certain\r\npoisons which check their growth. In the blood and lymph of man\r\nand other animals there are present certain products which have a\r\ndirect deleterious influence upon the growth of micro-organisms.\r\nThe existence of these poisons is undoubted, many an experiment\r\nhaving directly attested to their presence in the blood of\r\nanimals. Of their nature we know very little, but of their\r\nrepressing influence upon bacterial growth we are sure. They have\r\nbeen named alexines, and they are produced in the living tissue,\r\nalthough as to the method of their production we are in ignorance.\r\nBy the aid of these poisons the body is able to prevent the growth\r\nof the vast majority of bacteria which get into its tissues.\r\nOrdinary micro-organisms are killed at once, for these alexines\r\nact as antiseptics, and common bacteria can no more grow in the\r\nliving body than they could in a solution containing other poisons\r\nThus the body has a perfect protection against the majority of\r\nbacteria. The great host of species which are found in water,\r\nmilk, air, in our mouths or clinging to our skin, and which are\r\nalmost omnipresent in Nature, are capable of growing well enough\r\nin ordinary lifeless organic foods, but just as soon as they\r\nsucceed in finding entrance into living human tissue their growth\r\nis checked at once by these antiseptic agents which are poured\r\nupon them. Such bacteria are therefore not pathogenic germs, and\r\nnot sources of trouble to human health.\r\n\r\nThere are, on the other hand, a few species of bacteria which may\r\nbe able to retain their lodgment in the body m spite of this\r\nattempt of the individual to get rid of them. These, of course,\r\nconstitute the pathogenic species, or so called \"disease germs\".\r\nOnly such species as can overcome this first resistance can be\r\ndisease germs, for they alone can retain their foothold in the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBut how do these species overcome the poisons, which kill the\r\nother harmless bacteria? They, as well as the harmless forms, find\r\nthese alexines injurious to their growth, but in some way they are\r\nable to counteract the poisons. In this general discussion of\r\npoisons we are dealing with a subject which is somewhat obscure,\r\nbut apparently the pathogenic bacteria are able to overcome the\r\nalexines of the body by producing in their turn certain other\r\nproducts which neutralize the alexines, thus annulling their\r\naction. These pathogenic bacteria, when they get into the body,\r\ngive rise at once to a group of bodies which have been named\r\nlysines. These lysines are as mysterious to us as the alexines,\r\nbut they neutralize the effect of the alexines and thus overcome\r\nthe resistance the body offers to bacterial growth The invaders\r\ncan now multiply rapidly enough to get a lasting foothold in the\r\nbody and then soon produce the abnormal symptoms which we call\r\ndisease Pathogenic bacteria thus differ from the non-pathogenic\r\nbacteria primarily in this power of secreting products which can\r\nneutralize the ordinary effects of the alexines, and so overcome\r\nthe body's normal resistance to their parasitic life.\r\n\r\nEven if the bacteria do thus overcome the alexines the battle is\r\nnot yet over, for the individual has another method of defence\r\nwhich is now brought into activity to check the growth of the\r\ninvading organisms. This second method of resistance is by means\r\nof a series of active cells found in the blood, known as white\r\nblood-corpuscles (Fig. 33 a, b). They are minute bits of\r\nprotoplasm present in the blood and lymph in large quantities.\r\nThey are active cells, capable of locomotion and able to crawl out\r\nof the blood-vessels Not infrequently they are found to take into\r\ntheir bodies small objects with which they come in contact. One of\r\ntheir duties is thus to engulf minute irritating bodies which may\r\nbe in the tissues, and to carry them away for excretion. They thus\r\nact as scavengers These corpuscles certainly have some agency in\r\nwarding off the attacks of pathogenic bacteria Very commonly they\r\ncollect in great numbers in the region of the body where invading\r\nbacteria are found. Such invading bacteria exist upon them a\r\nstrong attraction, and the corpuscles leave the blood-vessels and\r\nsometimes form a solid phalanx completely surrounding the invading\r\ngerms. Their collection at these points may make itself seen\r\nexternally by the phenomenon we call inflammation.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the corpuscles engage in conflict with\r\nthe bacteria when they thus surround them. There has been not a\r\nlittle dispute, however, as to the method by which they carry on\r\nthe conflict. It has been held by some that the corpuscles\r\nactually take the bacteria into their bodies, swallow them, as it\r\nwere, and subsequently digest them (Fig. 33 c, d, e). This idea\r\ngave rise to the theory of phagocytosis, and the corpuscles were\r\nconsequently named phagocytes. The study of several years has,\r\nhowever, made it probable that this is not the ordinary method by\r\nwhich the corpuscles destroy the bacteria. According to our\r\npresent knowledge the method is a chemical one. These cells, when\r\nthey thus collect in quantities around the invaders, appear to\r\nsecrete from their own bodies certain injurious products which act\r\nupon the bacteria much as do the alexines already mentioned. These\r\nnew bodies have a decidedly injurious effect upon the multiplying\r\nbacteria; they rapidly check their growth, and, acting in union\r\nwith the alexines, may perhaps entirely destroy them.\r\n\r\nAfter the bacteria are thus killed, the white blood-corpuscles may\r\nload themselves with their dead bodies and carry them away (Fig.\r\n33 d, e). Sometimes they pass back into the blood stream and carry\r\nthe bacteria to various parts of the body for elimination. Not\r\ninfrequently the white corpuscles die in the contest, and then may\r\naccumulate in the form of pus and make their way through the skin\r\nto be discharged directly. The battle between these phagocytes and\r\nthe bacteria goes on vigorously. If in the end the phagocytes\r\nprove too strong for the invaders, the bacteria are gradually all\r\ndestroyed, and the attack is repelled. Under these circumstances\r\nthe individual commonly knows nothing--of the matter. This\r\nconflict has taken place entirely without any consciousness on his\r\npart, and he may not even know that he has been exposed to the\r\nattack of the bacteria. In other cases the bacteria prove too\r\nstrong for the phagocytes. They multiply too rapidly, and\r\nsometimes they produce secretions which actually drive the\r\nphagocytes away. Commonly, as already noticed, the corpuscles are\r\nattracted to the point of invasion, but in some cases, when a\r\nparticularly deadly and vigorous species of bacteria invades the\r\nbody, the secretions produced by them are so powerful as actually\r\nto drive the corpuscles away. Under these circumstances the\r\ninvading hosts have a chance to multiply unimpeded, to distribute\r\nthemselves over the body, and the disease rapidly follows as the\r\nresult of their poisoning action on the body tissues.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, then, that the human body is not helpless in the\r\npresence of the bacteria of disease, but that it is supplied with\r\npowerful resistant forces. It must not be supposed, however, that\r\nthe outline of the action of these forces just given is anything\r\nlike a complete account of the matter; nor must it be inferred\r\nthat the resistance is in all respects exactly as outlined. The\r\nsubject has only recently been an object of investigation, and we\r\nare as yet in the dark in regard to many of the facts. The future\r\nmay require us to modify to some extent even the brief outline\r\nwhich has been given. But while we recognise this uncertainty in\r\nthe details, we may be assured of the general facts. The living\r\nbody has some very efficacious resistant forces which prevent most\r\nbacteria from growing within its tissues, and which in large\r\nmeasure may be relied upon to drive out the true pathogenic\r\nbacteria. These resistant forces are in part associated with the\r\nproductions of body poisons, and are in part associated with the\r\nactive powers of special cells which have been called phagocytes.\r\nThe origin of the poisons and the exact method of action of the\r\nphagocytes we may well leave to the future to explain.\r\n\r\nThese resisting powers of the body will vary with conditions. It\r\nis evident that they are natural powers, and they will doubtless\r\nvary with the general condition of vigour of the individual.\r\nRobust health, a body whose powers are strong, well nourished, and\r\nvigorous, will plainly furnish the conditions for the greatest\r\nresistance to bacterial diseases. One whose bodily activities are\r\nweakened by poor nutrition can offer less resistance. The question\r\nwhether one shall suffer from a germ disease is not simply the\r\nquestion whether he shall be exposed, or even the question whether\r\nthe bacteria shall find entrance into his body. It is equally\r\ndependent upon whether he has the bodily vigour to produce\r\nalexines in proper quantity, or to summon the phagocytes in\r\nsufficient abundance and vigour to ward off the attack. We may do\r\nmuch to prevent disease by sanitation, which aids in protecting\r\nthe individual from attack; but we must not forget that the other\r\nhalf of the battle is of equal importance, and hence we must do\r\nall we can to strengthen the resisting forces of the organism.\r\n\r\nRECOVERY FROM GERM DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThese resisting forces are not always sufficient to drive off the\r\ninvaders. The organisms may retain their hold in the body for a\r\ntime and eventually break down the resistance. After this they may\r\nmultiply unimpeded and take entire possession of the body. As they\r\nbecome more numerous their poisonous products increase and begin\r\nto produce direct poisoning effects on the body. The incubation\r\nperiod is over and the disease comes on. The disease now runs its\r\ncourse. It becomes commonly more and more severe until a crisis is\r\nreached. Then, unless the poisoning is so severe that death\r\noccurs, the effects pass away and recovery takes place.\r\n\r\nBut why should not a germ disease be always fatal? If the bacteria\r\nthus take possession of the body and can grow there, why do they\r\nnot always continue to multiply until they produce sufficient\r\npoison to destroy the life of the individual? Such fatal results\r\ndo, of course, occur, but in by far the larger proportion of cases\r\nrecovery finally takes place.\r\n\r\nPlainly, the body must have another set of resisting forces which\r\nis concerned in the final recovery. Although weakened by the\r\npoisoning and suffering from the disease, it does not yield the\r\nbattle, but somewhat slowly organizes a new attack upon the\r\ninvaders. For a time the multiplying bacteria have an unimpeded\r\ncourse and grow rapidly; but finally their further increase is\r\nchecked, their vigour impaired, and after this they diminish in\r\nnumbers and are finally expelled from the body entirely. Of the\r\nnature of this new resistance but little is yet known. We notice,\r\nin the first place, that commonly after such a recovery the\r\nindividual has decidedly increased resistance to the disease. This\r\nincreased resistance may be very lasting, and may be so\r\nconsiderable as to give almost complete immunity from the disease\r\nfor many years, or for life. One attack of scarlet fever gives the\r\nindividual great immunity for the future. On the other hand, the\r\nresistance thus derived may be very temporary, as in the case of\r\ndiphtheria. But a certain amount of resistance appears to be\r\nalways acquired. This power of resisting the activities of the\r\nparasites seems to be increased during the progress of the\r\ndisease, and, if it becomes sufficient, it finally drives off the\r\nbacteria before they have produced death. After this, recovery\r\ntakes place. To what this newly acquired resisting power is due is\r\nby no means clear to bacteriologists, although certain factors\r\nare already known. It appears beyond question that in the case of\r\ncertain diseases the cells of the body after a time produce\r\nsubstances which serve as antidotes to the poisons produced by the\r\nbacteria during their growth in the body-antitoxines. In the case\r\nof diphtheria, for instance, the germs growing in the throat\r\nproduce poisons which are absorbed by the body and give rise to\r\nthe symptoms of the disease; but after a time the body cells\r\nreact, and themselves produce a counter toxic body which\r\nneutralizes the poisonous effect of the diphtheria poison. This\r\nsubstance has been isolated from the blood of animals that have\r\nrecovered from an attack of diphtheria, and has been called\r\ndiphtheria antitoxine. But even with this knowledge the recovery\r\nis not fully explained. This antitoxine neutralizes the effects of\r\nthe diphtheria toxine, and then the body develops strength to\r\ndrive off the bacteria which have obtained lodgment in the throat.\r\nHow they accomplish this latter achievement we do not know as yet.\r\nThe antitoxme developed simply neutralizes the effects of the\r\ntoxine. Some other force must be at work to get rid of the\r\nbacteria, a force which can only exert itself after the poisoning\r\neffect of the poison is neutralized. In these cases, then, the\r\nrecovery is due, first, to the development in the body of the\r\nnatural antidotes to the toxic poisons, and, second, to some other\r\nunknown force which drives off the parasites.\r\n\r\nThese facts are certainly surprising. If one had been asked to\r\nsuggest the least likely theory to explain recovery from disease,\r\nhe could hardly have found one more unlikely than that the body\r\ncells developed during the disease an antidote to the poison which\r\nthe disease bacteria were producing. Nevertheless, it is beyond\r\nquestion that such antidotes are formed during the course of the\r\ngerm diseases. It has not yet been shown in all diseases, and it\r\nwould be entirely too much to claim that this is the method of\r\nrecovery in all cases. We may say, however, in regard to bacterial\r\ndiseases in general, that after the bacteria enter the body at\r\nsome weak point they have first a battle to fight with the\r\nresisting powers of the body, which appear to be partly biological\r\nand partly chemical. These resisting powers are in many cases\r\nentirely sufficient to prevent the bacteria from obtaining a\r\nfoothold. If the invading host overcome the resisting powers, then\r\nthey begin to multiply rapidly, and take possession of the body or\r\nsome part of it. They continue to grow until either the individual\r\ndies or something occurs to check their growth. After the\r\nindividual develops the renewed powers of checking their growth,\r\nrecovery takes place, and the individual is then, because of these\r\nrenewed powers of resistance, immune from a second attack of the\r\ndisease for a variable length of time.\r\n\r\nThis, in the merest outline, represents the relation of bacterial\r\nparasites to the human body But while this is a fair general\r\nexpression of the matter, it must be recognised that different\r\ndiseases differ much in their relations, and no general outline\r\nwill apply to all They differ in their method of attack and in the\r\npoint of attack. Not only do they produce different kinds of\r\npoisons giving rise to different symptoms of poisoning; not only\r\ndo they produce different results in different animals; not only\r\ndo the different pathogenic species differ much in their power\r\nto develop serious disease, but the different species are very\r\nparticular as to what species of animal they attack. Some of them\r\ncan live as parasites in man alone; some can live as parasites\r\nupon man and the mouse and a few other animals; some can live in\r\nvarious animals but not in man; some appear to be able to live in\r\nthe field mouse, but not in the common mouse; some live in the\r\nhorse; some in birds, but not in warm-blooded mammals; while\r\nothers, again, can live almost equally well in the tissues of a\r\nlong list of animals. Those which can live as parasites upon man\r\nare, of course, especially related to human disease, and are of\r\nparticular interest to the physician, while those which live in\r\nanimals are in a similar way of interest to veterinarians.\r\n\r\nThus we see that parasitic bacteria show the widest variations.\r\nThey differ in point of attack, in method of attack, and in the\r\npart of the body which they seize upon as a nucleus for growth.\r\nThey differ in violence and in the character of the poisons they\r\nproduce, as well as in their power of overcoming the resisting\r\npowers of the body. They differ at different times in their powers\r\nof producing disease. In short, they show such a large number of\r\ndifferent methods of action that no general statements can be made\r\nwhich will apply universally, and no one method of guarding\r\nagainst them or in driving them off can be hoped to apply to any\r\nextended list of diseases.\r\n\r\nDISEASES CAUSED BY OTHER ORGANISMS THAN BACTERIA.\r\n\r\nAlthough the purpose of this work is to deal primarily with the\r\nbacterial world, it would hardly be fitting to leave the subject\r\nwithout some reference to diseases caused by organisms which do\r\nnot belong to the group of bacteria. While most of the so-called\r\ngerm diseases are caused by the bacteria which we have been\r\nstudying in the previous chapters, there are some whose inciting\r\ncause is to be found among organisms belonging to other groups.\r\nSome of these are plants of a higher organization than bacteria,\r\nbut others are undoubtedly microscopic animals. Their life habits\r\nare somewhat different from those of bacteria, and hence the\r\ncourse of the diseases is commonly different. Of the diseases thus\r\nproduced by microscopic animals or by higher plants, one or two\r\nare of importance enough to deserve special mention here.\r\n\r\nMalaria.--The most important of these diseases is malaria in its\r\nvarious forms, and known under various names--chills and fever,\r\nautumnal fever, etc. This disease, so common almost everywhere,\r\nhas been studied by physicians and scientists for a long time, and\r\nmany have been the causes assigned to it. At one time it was\r\nthought to be the result of the growth of a bacterium, and a\r\ndistinct bacillus was described as producing it. It has finally\r\nbeen shown, however, to be caused by a microscopic organism\r\nbelonging to the group of unicellular animals, and somewhat\r\nclosely related to the well-known amoeba. This organism is shown\r\nin Fig. 34. The whole history of the malarial organism is not yet\r\nknown. The following statements comprise the most important facts\r\nknown in regard to it, and its relation to the disease in man.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the malarial germ has some home outside the human\r\nbody, but it is not yet very definitely known what this external\r\nhome is; nor do we know from what source the human parasite is\r\nderived. It appears probable that water serves in some cases as\r\nits means of transference to man, and air in other cases. From\r\nsome external source it gains access to man and finds its way into\r\nthe blood. Here it attacks the red blood-corpuscles, each malarial\r\norganism making its way into a single one (Fig. 340). Here it now\r\ngrows, increasing in size at the expense of the substance of the\r\ncorpuscle. As it becomes larger it becomes granular, and soon\r\nshows a tendency to separate into a number of irregular masses.\r\nFinally it breaks up into many minute bodies called spores. These\r\nbodies break out of the corpuscle and for a time live a free life\r\nin the blood. After a time they make their way into other red\r\nblood-corpuscles, develop into new malarial amoeboid parasites,\r\nand repeat the growth and sporulation. This process can apparently\r\nbe repeated many times without check.\r\n\r\nThese organisms are thus to be regarded as parasites of the red\r\ncorpuscles. It is, of course, easy to believe that an extensive\r\nparasitism and destruction of the corpuscles would be disastrous\r\nto the health of the individual, and the severity of the disease\r\nwill depend upon the extent of the parasitism. Corresponding to\r\nthis life history of the organism, the disease malaria is commonly\r\ncharacterized by a decided intermittency, periods of chill and\r\nfever alternating with periods of intermission in which these\r\nsymptoms are abated. The paroxysms of the disease, characterized\r\nby the chill, occur at the time that the spores are escaping from\r\nthe blood-corpuscles and floating in the blood. After they have\r\nagain found their way into a blood-corpuscle the fever diminishes,\r\nand during their growth in the corpuscle until the next\r\nsporulation the individual has a rest from the more severe\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be more than one variety of the malarial\r\norganism, the different types differing in the length of time it\r\ntakes for their growth and sporulation. There is one variety, the\r\nmost common one, which requires two days for its growth, thus\r\ngiving rise to the paroxysm of the disease about once in forty-\r\neight hours; another variety appears to require three days for its\r\ngrowth; while still another variety appears to be decidedly\r\nirregular in its period of growth and sporulation. These facts\r\nreadily explain some of the variations in the disease. Certain\r\nother irregularities appear to be due to a different cause. More\r\nthan one brood of parasites may be in the blood of the individual\r\nat the same time, one producing sporulation at one time and\r\nanother at a different time. Such a simultaneous growth of two\r\nindependent broods may plainly produce almost any kind of\r\nmodification in the regularity of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe malarial organism appears to be very sensitive to quinine, a\r\nvery small quantity being sufficient to kill it. Upon this point\r\ndepends the value of quinine as a medicine. If the drug be present\r\nin the blood at the time when the spores are set free from the\r\nblood-corpuscle, they are rapidly killed by it before they have a\r\nchance to enter another corpuscle. During their growth in the\r\ncorpuscle they are far less sensitive to quinine than when they\r\nexist in the free condition as spores, and at this time the drug\r\nhas little effect.\r\n\r\nThe malarial organism is an animal, and can not be cultivated in\r\nthe laboratory by any artificial method yet devised. Its whole\r\nhistory is therefore not known. It doubtless has some home outside\r\nthe blood of animals, and very likely it may pass through other\r\nstages of a metamorphosis in the bodies of other animals. Most\r\nparasitic animals have two or more hosts upon which they live,\r\nalternating from one to the other, and that such is the case with\r\nthe malarial parasite is at least probable. But as yet\r\nbacteriologists have been unable to discover anything very\r\ndefinite in regard to the matter. Until we can learn something in\r\nregard to its life outside the blood of man we can do little in\r\nthe way of devising methods to avoid it.\r\n\r\nMalaria differs from most germ diseases in the fact that the\r\norganisms which produce it are not eliminated from the body in any\r\nway. In most germ diseases the germs are discharged from the\r\npatient by secretions or excretions of some kind, and from these\r\nexcretions may readily find their way into other individuals. The\r\nmalarial organism is not discharged from the body in any way, and\r\nhence is not contagious. If the parasite does pass part of its\r\nhistory in some other animal than man, there must be some means by\r\nwhich it passes from man to its other host. It has been suggested\r\nthat some of the insects which feed upon human blood may serve as\r\nthe second host and become inoculated when feeding upon such\r\nblood. This has been demonstrated with startling success in regard\r\nto the mosquito (Anopheles), some investigators going so far as to\r\nsay that this is the only way in which the disease can be\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nSeveral other microscopic animals occur as parasites upon man, and\r\nsome of them are so definitely associated with certain diseases as\r\nto lead to the belief that they are the cause of these diseases.\r\nThe only one of very common occurrence is a species known as\r\nAmaeba coli, which is found in cases of dysentery. In a certain\r\ntype of dysentery this organism is so universally found that there\r\nis little doubt that it is in some very intimate way associated\r\nwith the cause of the disease. Definite proof of the matter is,\r\nhowever, as yet wanting.\r\n\r\nOn the side of plants, we find that several plants of a higher\r\norganization than bacteria may become parasitic upon the body of\r\nman and produce various types of disease. These plants belong\r\nmostly to the same group as the moulds, and they are especially\r\napt to attack the skin. They grow in the skin, particularly under\r\nthe hair, and may send their threadlike branches into some of the\r\nsubdermal tissues. This produces irritation and inflammation of\r\nthe skin, resulting in trouble, and making sores difficult to\r\nheal. So long as the plant continues to grow, the sores, of\r\ncourse, can not be healed, and when the organisms get into the\r\nskin under the hair it is frequently difficult to destroy them.\r\nAmong the diseases thus caused are ringworm, thrush, alopecia,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF COMBATING PARASITIC BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief advantage of knowing the cause of disease is that it\r\ngives us a vantage ground from which we may hope to find means of\r\navoiding its evils. The study of medicine in the past history of\r\nthe world has been almost purely empirical, with a very little of\r\nscientific basis. Great hopes are now entertained that these new\r\nfacts will place this matter upon a more strictly scientific\r\nfoundation. Certainly in the past twenty-five years, since\r\nbacteriology has been studied, more has been done to solve\r\nproblems connected with disease than ever before. This new\r\nknowledge has been particularly directed toward means of avoiding\r\ndisease. Bacteriology has thus far borne fruit largely in the line\r\nof preventive medicine, although to a certain extent also along\r\nthe line of curative medicine. This chapter will be devoted to\r\nconsidering how the study of bacteriology has contributed directly\r\nand indirectly to our power of combating disease.\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nIn the study of medicine in the past centuries the only aim has\r\nbeen to discover methods of curing disease; at the present time a\r\nlarge and increasing amount of study is devoted to the methods of\r\npreventing disease. Preventive medicine is a development of the\r\nlast few years, and is based almost wholly upon our knowledge of\r\nbacteria. This subject is yearly becoming of more importance.\r\nForewarned is forearmed, and it has been found that to know the\r\ncause of a disease is a long step toward avoiding it. As some of\r\nour contagious and epidemic diseases have been studied in the\r\nlight of bacteriological knowledge, it has been found possible to\r\ndetermine not only their cause, but also how infection is brought\r\nabout, and consequently how contagion may be avoided. Some of the\r\nresults which have grown up so slowly as to be hardly appreciated\r\nare really great triumphs. For instance, the study of bacteriology\r\nfirst led us to suspect, and then demonstrated, that tuberculosis\r\nis a contagious disease, and from the time that this was thus\r\nproved there has been a slow, but, it is hoped, a sure decline in\r\nthis disease. Bacteriological study has shown that the source of\r\ncholera infection in cases of raging epidemics is, in large part\r\nat least, our drinking water; and since this has been known,\r\nalthough cholera has twice invaded Europe, and has been widely\r\ndistributed, it has not obtained any strong foothold or given rise\r\nto any serious epidemic except in a few cases where its ravages\r\ncan be traced to recognised carelessness. It is very significant\r\nto compare the history of the cholera epidemics of the past few\r\nyears with those of earlier dates. In the epidemics of earlier\r\nyears the cholera swept ruthlessly through communities without\r\ncheck. In the last few years, although it has repeatedly knocked\r\nat the doors of many European cities, it has been commonly\r\nconfined to isolated cases, except in a few instances where these\r\nfacts concerning the relation to drinking water were ignored.\r\n\r\nThe study of preventive medicine is yet in its infancy, but it has\r\nalready accomplished much. It has developed modern systems of\r\nsanitation, has guided us in the building of hospitals, given\r\nrules for the management of the sick-room which largely prevent\r\ncontagion from patient to nurse; it has told us what diseases are\r\ncontagious, and in what way; it has told us what sources of\r\ncontagion should be suspected and guarded against, and has thus\r\ndone very much to prevent the spread of disease. Its value is seen\r\nin the fact that there has been a constant decrease in the death\r\nrate since modern ideas of sanitation began to have any influence,\r\nand in the fact that our general epidemics are less severe than in\r\nformer years, as well as in the fact that more people escape the\r\ndiseases which were in former times almost universal.\r\n\r\nThe study of preventive medicine takes into view several factors,\r\nall connected with the method and means of contagion. They are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThe Source of Infectious Material.--t has been learned that for\r\nmost diseases the infectious material comes from individuals\r\nsuffering with the disease, and that except in a few cases, like\r\nmalaria, we must always look to individuals suffering from disease\r\nfor all sources of contagion. It is found that pathogenic bacteria\r\nare in all these cases eliminated from the patient in some way,\r\neither from the alimentary canal or from skin secretions or\r\notherwise, and that any nurse with common sense can have no\r\ndifficulty in determining in what way the infectious material is\r\neliminated from her patients. When this fact is known and taken\r\ninto consideration it is a comparatively easy matter to devise\r\nvaluable precautions against distribution of such material. It is\r\nthus of no small importance to remember that the simple presence\r\nof bacteria in food or drink is of no significance unless these\r\nbacteria have come from some source of disease infection.\r\n\r\nThe Method of Distribution.--The bacteria must next get from the\r\noriginal source of the disease to the new susceptible individual.\r\nBacteria have no independent powers of distribution unless they be\r\nimmersed in liquids, and therefore their passage from individual\r\nto individual must be a passive one. They are readily\r\ntransferred, however, by a number of different means, and the\r\nstudy of these means is aiding much in checking contagion Study\r\nalong this line has shown that the means by which bacteria are\r\ncarried are several. First we may notice food as a distributor.\r\nFood may become contaminated by infectious material in many ways;\r\nfor example, by contact with sewage, or with polluted water, or\r\neven with eating utensils which have been used by patients. Water\r\nis also likely to be contaminated with infectious material, and is\r\na fertile source for distributing typhoid and cholera. Milk may\r\nbecome contaminated in a variety of ways, and be a source of\r\ndistributing the bacteria which produce typhoid fever,\r\ntuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and a few other less\r\ncommon diseases. Again, infected clothing, bedding, or eating\r\nutensils may be taken from a patient and be used by another\r\nindividual without proper cleansing. Direct contact, or contact\r\nwith infected animals, furnishes another method. Insects sometimes\r\ncarry the bacteria from person to person, and in some diseases\r\n(tuberculosis, and perhaps scarlet fever and smallpox) we must\r\nlook to the air as a distributor of the infectious material.\r\nKnowledge of these facts is helping to account for multitudes of\r\nmysterious cases of infection, especially when we combine them\r\nwith the known sources of contagious matter.\r\n\r\nMeans of Invasion.--Bacteriology has shown us that different\r\nspecies of parasitic bacteria have different means of entering the\r\nbody, and that each must enter the proper place in order to get a\r\nfoothold. After we learn that typhoid infectious material must\r\nenter the mouth in order to produce the disease; that tuberculosis\r\nmay find entrance through the nose in breathing, while types of\r\nblood poisoning enter only through wounds or broken skin, we learn\r\nat once fundamental facts as to the proper methods of meeting\r\nthese dangers. We learn that with some diseases care exercised to\r\nprevent the swallowing of infectious material is sufficient to\r\nprevent contagion, while with others this is entirely\r\ninsufficient. When all these facts are understood it is almost\r\nalways perfectly possible to avoid contagion; and as these facts\r\nbecome more and more widely known direct contagion is sure to\r\nbecome less frequent.\r\n\r\nAbove all, it is telling us what becomes of the pathogenic\r\nbacteria after being eliminated from the body of the patient; how\r\nthey may exist for a long time still active; how they may lurk in\r\nfilth or water dormant but alive, or how they may even multiply\r\nthere. Preventive medicine is telling us how to destroy those thus\r\nlying in wait for a chance of infection, by discovering\r\ndisinfectants and telling us especially where and when to use\r\nthem. It has already taught us how to crush out certain forms of\r\nepidemics by the proper means of destroying bacteria, and is\r\nlessening the dangers from contagious diseases. In short, the\r\nstudy of bacteriology has brought us into a condition where we are\r\nno longer helpless in the presence of a raging epidemic. We no\r\nlonger sit in helpless dismay, as did our ancestors, when an\r\nepidemic enters a community, but, knowing their causes and\r\nsources, set about at once to remove them. As a result, severe\r\nepidemics are becoming comparatively short-lived.\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN SURGERY.\r\n\r\nIn no line of preventive medicine has bacteriology been of so much\r\nvalue and so striking in its results as in surgery. Ever since\r\nsurgery has been practised surgeons have had two difficulties to\r\ncontend with. The first has been the shock resulting from the\r\noperation. This is dependent upon the extent of the operation, and\r\nmust always be a part of a surgical operation. The second has been\r\nsecondary effects following the operation. After the operation,\r\neven though it was successful, there were almost sure to arise\r\nsecondary complications known as surgical fever, inflammation,\r\nblood poisoning, gangrene, etc., which frequently resulted\r\nfatally. These secondary complications were commonly much more\r\nserious than the shock of the operation, and it used to be the\r\ncommon occurrence for the patient to recover entirely from the\r\nshock, but yield to the fevers which followed. They appeared to be\r\nentirely unavoidable, and were indeed regarded as necessary parts\r\nof the healing of the wound. Too frequently it appeared that the\r\ngreater the care taken with the patient the more likely he was to\r\nsuffer from some of these troubles. The soldier who was treated on\r\nthe battlefield and nursed in an improvised field hospital would\r\nfrequently recover, while the soldier who had the fortune to be\r\ntaken into the regular hospital, where greater care was possible,\r\nsuccumbed to hospital gangrene. All these facts were clearly\r\nrecognised, but the surgeon, through ignorance of their cause, was\r\nhelpless in the presence of these inflammatory troubles, and felt\r\nit always necessary to take them into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration that putrefaction and decay were caused by\r\nbacteria, and the early proof that the silkworm disease was\r\nproduced by a micro-organism, led to the suggestion that the\r\ninflammatory diseases accompanying wounds were similarly caused.\r\nThere are many striking similarities between these troubles and\r\nputrefaction, and the suggestion was an obvious one. At first,\r\nhowever, and for quite a number of years, it was impossible to\r\ndemonstrate the theory by finding the distinct species of micro-\r\norganisms which produced the troubles. We have already seen that\r\nthere are several different species of bacteria which are\r\nassociated with this general class of diseases, but that no\r\nspecific one has any particular relation to a definite type of\r\ninflammation. This fact made discoveries in this connection a slow\r\nmatter from the microscopical standpoint. But long before this\r\ndemonstration was finally reached the theory had received\r\npractical application in the form of what has developed into\r\nantiseptic or aseptic surgery.\r\n\r\nAntiseptic surgery is based simply upon the attempt to prevent the\r\nentrance of bacteria into the surgical wound. It is assumed that\r\nif these organisms are kept from the wound the healing will take\r\nplace without the secondary fevers and inflammations which occur\r\nif they do get a chance to grow in the wound. The theory met with\r\ndecided opposition at first, but accumulating facts demonstrated\r\nits value, and to-day its methods have been adopted everywhere in\r\nthe civilized world. As the evidence has been accumulating,\r\nsurgeons have learned many important facts, foremost among which\r\nis a knowledge of the common sources from which the infection of\r\nwounds occurs. At first it was thought that the air was the great\r\nsource of infection, but the air bacteria have been found to be\r\nusually harmless. It has appeared that the more common sources are\r\nthe surgeon's instruments, or his hands, or the clothing or\r\nsponges which are allowed to come in contact with the wounds. It\r\nhas also appeared that the bacteria which produce this class of\r\ntroubles are common species, existing everywhere and universally\r\npresent around the body, clinging to the clothing or skin, and\r\nalways on hand to enter the wound if occasion offers. They are\r\nalways present, but commonly harmless. They are not foreign\r\ninvaders like the more violent pathogenic species, such as those\r\nof Asiatic cholera, but may be compared to domestic enemies at\r\nhand. It is these ever-present bacteria which the surgeon must\r\nguard against. The methods by which he does this need not detain\r\nus here. They consist essentially in bacteriological cleanliness.\r\nThe operation is performed with sterilized instruments under most\r\nexacting conditions of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe result has been a complete revolution in surgery. As the\r\nmethods have become better understood and more thoroughly adopted,\r\nthe instances of secondary troubles following surgical wounds have\r\nbecome less and less frequent until they have practically\r\ndisappeared in all simple cases. To-day the surgeon recognises\r\nthat when inflammatory troubles of this sort follow simple\r\nsurgical wounds it is a testimony to his carelessness. The skilful\r\nsurgeon has learned that with the precautions which he is able to\r\ntake to-day he has to fear only the direct effect of the shock of\r\nthe wound and its subsequent direct influence; but secondary\r\nsurgical fevers, blood poisoning, and surgical gangrene need not\r\nbe taken into consideration at all. Indeed, the modern surgeon\r\nhardly knows what surgical gangrene is, and bacteriologists have\r\nhad practically no chance to study it. Secondary infections have\r\nlargely disappeared, and the surgeon is concerned simply with the\r\neffect of the wound itself, and the power of the body to withstand\r\nthe shock and subsequently heal the wound.\r\n\r\nWith these secondary troubles no longer to disturb him, the\r\nsurgeon has become more and more bold. Operations formerly not\r\ndreamed of are now performed without hesitation. In former years\r\nan operation which opened the abdominal cavity was not thought\r\npossible, or at least it was so nearly certain to result fatally\r\nthat it was resorted to only on the last extremity; while to-day\r\nsuch operations are hardly regarded as serious. Even brain surgery\r\nis becoming more and more common. Possibly our surgeons are\r\npassing too far to the other extreme, and, feeling their power of\r\nperforming so many operations without inconvenience or danger,\r\nthey are using the knife in cases where it would be better to\r\nleave Nature to herself for her own healing. But, be this as it\r\nmay, it is impossible to estimate the amount of suffering\r\nprevented and the number of lives saved by the mastery of the\r\nsecondary inflammatory troubles which used to follow surgical\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nPreventive medicine, then, has for its object the prevention\r\nrather than the cure of disease. By showing the causes of disease\r\nand telling us where and how they are contracted, it is telling us\r\nhow they may to a large extent be avoided. Unlike practical\r\nmedicine, this subject is one which has a direct relation to the\r\ngeneral public. While it may be best that the knowledge of\r\ncurative methods be confined largely to the medical profession, it\r\nis eminently desirable that a knowledge of all the facts bearing\r\nupon preventive medicine should be distributed as widely as\r\npossible. One person can not satisfactorily apply his knowledge of\r\npreventive medicine, if his neighbour is ignorant of or careless\r\nof the facts. We can not hope to achieve the possibilities lying\r\nalong this line until there is a very wide distribution of\r\nknowledge. Every epidemic that sweeps through our communities is a\r\ntestimony to the crying need of education in regard to such simple\r\nfacts as the source of infectious material, the methods of its\r\ndistribution, and the means of rendering it harmless.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION IN INOCULATION.\r\n\r\nIt has long been recognised that in most cases recovery from one\r\nattack of a contagious disease renders an individual more or less\r\nimmune against a second attack. It is unusual for an individual to\r\nhave the same contagious disease twice. This belief is certainly\r\nbased upon fact, although the immunity thus acquired is subject to\r\nwide variations. There are some diseases in which there is little\r\nreason for thinking that any immunity is acquired, as in the case\r\nof tuberculosis, while there are others in which the immunity is\r\nvery great and very lasting, as in the case of scarlet fever.\r\nMoreover, the immunity differs with individuals. While some\r\npersons appear to acquire a lasting immunity by recovery from a\r\nsingle attack, others will yield to a second attack very readily.\r\nBut in spite of this the fact of such acquired immunity is beyond\r\nquestion. Apparently all infectious diseases from which a real\r\nrecovery takes place are followed by a certain amount of\r\nprotection from a second attack; but with some diseases the\r\nimmunity is very fleeting, while with others it is more lasting.\r\nDiseases which produce a general infection of the whole system\r\nare, as a rule, more likely to give rise to a lasting immunity\r\nthan those which affect only small parts. Tuberculosis, which, as\r\nalready noticed, is commonly quite localized in the body, has\r\nlittle power of conveying immunity, while a disease like scarlet\r\nfever, which affects the whole system, conveys a more lasting\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nSuch immunity has long been known, and in the earlier years was\r\nsometimes voluntarily acquired; even to-day we find some\r\nindividuals making use of the principle. It appears that a mild\r\nattack of such diseases produces immunity equally well with a\r\nsevere attack, and acting upon this fact mothers have not\r\ninfrequently intentionally exposed their children to certain\r\ndiseases at seasons when they are mild, in order to have the\r\ndisease \"over with\" and their children protected in the future.\r\nEven the more severe diseases have at times been thus voluntarily\r\nacquired. In China it has sometimes been the custom thus to\r\nacquire smallpox. Such methods are decidedly heroic, and of course\r\nto be heartily condemned. But the principle that a mild type of\r\nthe disease conveys protection has been made use of in a more\r\nlogical and defensible way.\r\n\r\nThe first instance of this principle was in vaccination against\r\nsmallpox, now practised for more than a century. Cowpox is\r\ndoubtless closely related to smallpox, and an attack of the former\r\nconveys a certain amount of protection against the latter. It was\r\neasy, therefore, to inoculate man with some of the infectious\r\nmaterial from cowpox, and thus give him some protection against\r\nthe more serious smallpox. This was a purely empirical discovery,\r\nand vaccination was practised long before the principle underlying\r\nit was understood, and long before the germ nature of disease was\r\nrecognised. The principle was revived again, however, by Pasteur,\r\nand this time with a logical thought as to its value. While\r\nworking upon anthrax among animals, he learned that here, as in\r\nother diseases, recovery, when it occurred, conveyed immunity.\r\nThis led him to ask if it were not possible to devise a method of\r\ngiving to animals a mild form of the disease and thus protect them\r\nfrom the more severe type. The problem of giving a mild type of\r\nthis extraordinarily severe disease was not an easy one. It could\r\nnot be done, of course, by inoculating the animals with a small\r\nnumber of the bacteria, for their power of multiplication would\r\nsoon make them indefinitely numerous. It was necessary in some way\r\nto diminish their violence. Pasteur succeeded in doing this by\r\ncausing them to grow in culture fluids for a time at a high\r\ntemperature. This treatment diminished their violence so much that\r\nthey could be inoculated into cattle, where they produced only the\r\nmildest type of indisposition, from which the animals speedily\r\nrecovered. But even this mild type of the disease was triumphantly\r\ndemonstrated to protect the animals from the most severe form of\r\nanthrax. The discovery was naturally hailed as a most remarkable\r\none, and one which promised great things in the future. If it was\r\nthus possible, by direct laboratory methods, to find a means of\r\ninoculating against a serious disease like anthrax, why could not\r\nthe same principle be applied to human diseases? The enthusiasts\r\nbegan at once to look forward to a time when all diseases should\r\nbe thus conquered.\r\n\r\nBut the principle has not borne the fruit at first expected. There\r\nis little doubt that it might be applied to quite a number of\r\nhuman diseases if a serious attempt should be made. But several\r\nobjections arise against its wide application. In the first place,\r\nthe inoculation thus necessary is really a serious matter. Even\r\nvaccination, as is well known, sometimes, through faulty methods,\r\nresults fatally, and it is a very serious thing to experiment upon\r\nhuman beings with anything so powerful for ill as pathogenic\r\nbacteria. The seriousness of the disease smallpox, its\r\nextraordinary contagiousness, and the comparatively mild results\r\nof vaccination, have made us willing to undergo vaccination at\r\ntimes of epidemics to avoid the somewhat great probability of\r\ntaking the disease. But mankind is unwilling to undergo such an\r\noperation, even though mild, for the purpose of avoiding other\r\nless severe diseases, or diseases which are less likely to be\r\ntaken. We are unwilling to be inoculated against mild diseases, or\r\nagainst the more severe ones which are uncommon. For instance, a\r\nmethod has been devised for rendering animals immune against\r\nlockjaw, which would probably apply equally well to man. But\r\nmankind in general will never adopt it, since the danger from\r\nlockjaw is so small. Inoculation must then be reserved for\r\ndiseases which are so severe and so common, or which occur in\r\nperiodical epidemics of so great severity, as to make people in\r\ngeneral willing to submit to inoculation as a protection. A\r\nfurther objection arises from the fact that the immunity acquired\r\nis not necessarily lasting. The cattle inoculated against anthrax\r\nretain their protective powers for only a few months. How long\r\nsimilar immunity might be retained in other cases we can not say,\r\nbut plainly this fact would effectually prevent this method of\r\nprotecting mankind from being used except in special cases. It is\r\nout of the question to think of constant and repeated inoculations\r\nagainst various diseases.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the principle of inoculation as an aid in preventive\r\nmedicine has not proved of very much value. The only other human\r\ndisease in which it has been attempted seriously is Asiatic\r\ncholera. This disease in times of epidemics is so severe and the\r\nchance of infection is so great as to justify such inoculation.\r\nSeveral bacteriologists have in the last few years been trying to\r\ndiscover a harmless method of inoculating against this disease.\r\nApparently they have succeeded, for experiments in India, the home\r\nof the cholera, have been as successful as could be anticipated.\r\nBacteriological science has now in its possession a means of\r\ninoculation against cholera which is perhaps as efficacious as\r\nvaccination is against smallpox. Whether it will ever be used to\r\nany extent is doubtful, since, as already pointed out, we are in a\r\nposition to avoid cholera epidemics by other means. If we can\r\nprotect our communities by guarding the water supply, it is not\r\nlikely that the method of inoculation will ever be widely used.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the application of preventive inoculation has\r\nbeen made, but one based upon a different principle. Hydrophobia\r\nis certainly one of the most horrible of diseases, although\r\ncomparatively rare. Its rarity would effectually prevent mankind\r\nfrom submitting to a general inoculation against it, but its\r\nseverity would make one who had been exposed to it by the bite of\r\na rabid animal ready to submit to almost any treatment that\r\npromised to ward off the disease. In the attempt to discover a\r\nmeans of inoculating against this disease it was necessary,\r\ntherefore, to find a method that could be applied after the time\r\nof exposure--i.e., after the individual had been bitten by the\r\nrabid animal. Fortunately, the disease has a long period of\r\nincubation, and one that has proved long enough for the purpose. A\r\nmethod of inoculation against this disease has been devised by\r\nPasteur, which can be applied after the individual has been bitten\r\nby the rabid animal. Apparently, however, this preventive\r\ninoculation is dependent upon a different principle from\r\nvaccination or inoculation against anthrax. It does not appear to\r\ngive rise to a mild form of the disease, thus protecting the\r\nindividual, but rather to an acquired tolerance of the chemical\r\npoisons produced by the disease. It is a well-known physiological\r\nfact that the body can become accustomed to tolerate poisons if\r\ninured to them by successively larger and larger doses. It is by\r\nthis power, apparently, that the inoculation against hydrophobia\r\nproduces its effect. Material containing the hydrophobia poison\r\n(taken from the spinal cord of a rabbit dead with the disease) is\r\ninjected into the individual after he has been bitten by a rabid\r\nanimal. The poisonous material in the first injection is very\r\nweak, but is followed later by a more powerful inoculation. The\r\nresult is that after a short time the individual has acquired the\r\npower of resisting the hydrophobia poisons. Before the incubation\r\nperiod of the original infectious matter from the bite of the\r\nrabid animal has passed, the inoculated individual has so\r\nthoroughly acquired a tolerance of the poison that he successfully\r\nresists the attack of the infection. This method of inoculation\r\nthus neutralizes the effects of the disease by anticipating them.\r\n\r\nThe method of treatment of hydrophobia met with extraordinarily\r\nviolent opposition. For several years it was regarded as a\r\nmistake. But the constantly accumulating statistics from the\r\nPasteur Institute have been so overwhelmingly on one side as to\r\nquiet opposition and bring about a general conviction that the\r\nmethod is a success.\r\n\r\nThe method of preventive inoculation has not been extensively\r\napplied to human diseases in addition to those mentioned. In a few\r\ncases a similar method has been used to guard against diphtheria.\r\nAmong animals, experiment has shown that such methods can quite\r\neasily be obtained, and doubtless the same would be true of\r\nmankind if it was thought practical or feasible to apply them.\r\nBut, for reasons mentioned, this feature of preventive medicine\r\nwill always remain rather unimportant, and will be confined to a\r\nfew of the more violent diseases.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to raise the question as to why a single attack\r\nwith recovery conveys immunity. This question is really a part of\r\nthe one already discussed as to the method by which the body cures\r\ndisease. We have seen that this is in part due to the development\r\nof chemical substances which either neutralize the poisons or act\r\nas germicide upon the bacteria, or both, and perhaps due in part\r\nto an active destruction of bacteria by cellular activity\r\n(phagocytosis). There is little reason to doubt that it is the\r\nsame set of activities which renders the animal immune. The forces\r\nwhich drive off the invading bacteria in one case are still\r\npresent to prevent a second attack of the same species of\r\nbacterium. The length of time during which these forces are active\r\nand sufficient to cope with any new invaders determines the length\r\nof time during which the immunity lasts. Until, therefore, we can\r\nanswer with more exactness just how cure is brought about in case\r\nof disease, we shall be unable to explain the method of immunity.\r\n\r\nLIMITS OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nWith all the advance in preventive medicine we can not hope to\r\navoid disease entirely. We are discovering that the sources of\r\ndisease are on all sides of us, and so omnipresent that to avoid\r\nthem completely is impossible. If we were to apply to our lives\r\nall the safeguards which bacteriology has taught us should be\r\napplied in order to avoid the different diseases, we would\r\nsurround ourselves with conditions which would make life\r\nintolerable. It would be oppressive enough for us to eat no food\r\nexcept when it is hot, to drink no water except when boiled, and\r\nto drink no milk except after sterilization; but these would not\r\nsatisfy the necessary conditions for avoiding disease. To meet all\r\ndangers, we should handle nothing which has not been sterilized,\r\nor should follow the handling by immediately sterilizing the\r\nhands; we should wear only disinfected clothes, we should never\r\nput our fingers in our mouths or touch our food with them; we\r\nshould cease to ride in public conveyances, and, indeed, should\r\ncease to breathe common air. Absolute prevention of the chance of\r\ninfection is impossible. The most that preventive medicine can\r\nhope for is to point out the most common and prolific sources of\r\ninfection, and thus enable civilized man to avoid some of his most\r\ncommon troubles. It becomes a question, therefore, where we will\r\nbest draw the line in the employment of safeguards. Shall we drink\r\nnone except sterilized milk, and no water unless boiled? or shall\r\nwe put these occasional sources of danger in the same category\r\nwith bicycle and railroad accidents, dangers which can be avoided\r\nby not using the bicycle or riding on the rail, but in regard to\r\nwhich the remedy is too oppressive for application?\r\n\r\nIndeed, when viewed in a broad philosophical light it may not be\r\nthe best course for mankind to shun all dangers. Strength in the\r\norganism comes from the use rather than the disuse of our powers.\r\nIt is certain that the general health and vigour of mankind is to\r\nbe developed by meeting rather than by shunning dangers.\r\nResistance to disease means bodily vigour, and this is to be\r\ndeveloped in mankind by the application of the principle of\r\nnatural selection. In accordance with this principle, disease will\r\ngradually remove the individuals of weak resisting powers, leaving\r\nthose of greater vigour. Parasitic bacteria are thus a means of\r\npreventing the continued life of the weaker members of the\r\ncommunity, and so tend to strengthen mankind. By preventive\r\nmedicine many a weak individual who would otherwise succumb\r\nearlier in the struggle is enabled to live a few years longer.\r\nWhatever be our humanitarian feeling for the individual, we can\r\nnot fail to admit that this survival of the weak is of no benefit\r\nto the race so far as the development of physical nature is\r\nconcerned. Indeed, if we were to take into consideration simply\r\nthe physical nature of man we should be obliged to recommend a\r\nsystem such as the ancient Spartans developed, of exposing to\r\ndeath all weakly individuals, that only the strong might live to\r\nbecome the fathers of future generations. In this light, of\r\ncourse, parasitic diseases would be an assistance rather than a\r\ndetriment to the human race. Of course such principles will never\r\nagain be dominant among men, and our conscience tells us to do all\r\nwe can to help the weak. We shall doubtless do all possible to\r\ndevelop preventive medicine in order to guard the weak against\r\nparasitic organisms. But it is at all events well for us to\r\nremember that we can never hope to develop the strength of the\r\nhuman race by shunning evil, but rather by combating it, and the\r\npower of the human race to resist the invasions of these organisms\r\nwill never be developed by the line of action which guards us from\r\nattack. Here, as in other directions, the principles of modern\r\nhumanity have, together with their undoubted favourable influence\r\nupon mankind, certain tendencies toward weakness. While we shall\r\nstill do our utmost to develop preventive medicine in a proper\r\nway, it may be well for us to remember these facts when we come to\r\nthe practical question of determining where to draw the limits of\r\nthe application of methods for preventing infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nCURATIVE MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nBacteriology has hitherto contributed less to curative than to\r\npreventive medicine. Nevertheless, its contributions to curative\r\nmedicine have not been unimportant, and there is promise of much\r\nmore in the future. It is, of course, unsafe to make predictions\r\nfor the future, but the accomplishments of the last few years give\r\nmuch hope as to further results.\r\n\r\nDRUGS.\r\n\r\nIt was at first thought that a knowledge of the specific bacteria\r\nwhich cause a disease would give a ready means of finding specific\r\ndrugs for the cure of such disease. If a definite species of\r\nbacterium causes a disease and we can cultivate the organism in\r\nthe laboratory, it is easy to find some drugs which will be fatal\r\nto its growth, and these same drugs, it would seem, should be\r\nvaluable as medicines in these diseases. This hope has, however,\r\nproved largely illusive. It is very easy to find some drug which\r\nproves fatal to the specific germs while growing in the culture\r\nmedia of the laboratory, but commonly these are of little or no\r\nuse when applied as medicines. In the first place, such substances\r\nare usually very deadly poisons. Corrosive sublimate is a\r\nsubstance which destroys all pathogenic germs with great rapidity,\r\nbut it is a deadly poison, and can not be used as a drug in\r\nsufficient quantity to destroy the parasitic bacteria in the body\r\nwithout at the same time producing poisonous effects on the body\r\nitself. It is evident that for any drug to be of value in thus\r\ndestroying bacteria it must have some specially strong action upon\r\nthe bacteria. Its germicide action on the bacteria should be so\r\nstrong that a dose which would be fatal or very injurious to them\r\nwould be too small to have a deleterious influence on the body of\r\nthe individual. It has not proved an easy task to discover drugs\r\nwhich will have any value as germicides when used in quantities so\r\nsmall as to produce no injurious effect on the body.\r\n\r\nA second difficulty is in getting the drug to produce its effect\r\nat the right point. A few diseases, as we have noticed, are\r\nproduced by bacteria which distribute themselves almost\r\nindiscriminately over the body; but the majority are somewhat\r\ndefinitely localized in special points. Tuberculosis may attack a\r\nsingle gland or a single lobe of the lung. Typhoid germ is\r\nlocalized in the intestines, liver, spleen, etc. Even if it were\r\npossible to find some drug which would have a very specific effect\r\nupon the tuberculosis bacillus, it is plain that it would be a\r\nvery questionable method of procedure to introduce this into the\r\nwhole system simply that it might have an effect upon a very small\r\nisolated gland. Sometimes such a bacterial affection may be\r\nlocalized in places where it can be specially treated, as in the\r\ncase of an attack on a dermal gland, and in these cases some of\r\nthe germicides have proved to be of much value. Indeed, the use of\r\nvarious disinfectants connected with abscesses and superficial\r\ninfections has proved of much value. To this extent, in\r\ndisinfecting wounds and as a local application, the development of\r\nour knowledge of disinfectants has given no little aid to curative\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nVery little success, however, has resulted in the attempt to find\r\nspecific drugs for specific diseases, and it is at least doubtful\r\nwhether many such will ever be found. The nearest approach to it\r\nis quinine as a specific poison for malarial troubles. Malarious\r\ndiseases are not, however, produced by bacteria but by a\r\nmicroscopic organism of a very different nature, thought to be an\r\nanimal rather than a plant. Besides this there has been little or\r\nno success in discovering specifics in the form of drugs which can\r\nbe given as medicines or inoculated with the hope of destroying\r\nspecial kinds of pathogenic bacteria without injury to the body.\r\nWhile it is unwise to make predictions as to future discoveries,\r\nthere seems at present little hope for a development of curative\r\nmedicine along these lines.\r\n\r\nVIS MEDICATRIX NATURAE.\r\n\r\nThe study of bacterial diseases as they progress in the body has\r\nemphasized above all things the fact that diseases are eventually\r\ncured by a natural rather than by an artificial process. If a\r\npathogenic bacterium succeeds in passing the outer safeguards and\r\nentering the body, and if it then succeeds in overcoming the\r\nforces of resistance which we have already noticed, it will begin\r\nto multiply and produce mischief. This multiplication now goes on\r\nfor a time unchecked, and there is little reason to expect that we\r\ncan ever do much toward checking it by means of drugs. But after a\r\nlittle, conditions arise which are hostile to the further growth\r\nof the parasite. These hostile conditions are produced perhaps in\r\npart by the secretions from the bacteria, for bacteria are unable\r\nto flourish in a medium containing much of their own secretions.\r\nThe secretions which they produce are poisons to them as well as\r\nto the individual in which they grow, and after these have become\r\nquite abundant the further growth of the bacterium is checked and\r\nfinally stopped. Partly, also, must we conclude that these hostile\r\nconditions are produced by active vital powers in the body of the\r\nindividual attacked. The individual, as we have seen, in some\r\ncases develops a quantity of some substance which neutralizes the\r\nbacterial poisons and thus prevents their having their maximum\r\neffect. Thus relieved from the direct effects of the poisons, the\r\nresisting powers are recuperated and once more begin to produce a\r\ndirect destruction of the bacteria. Possibly the bacteria, being\r\nnow weakened by the presence of their own products of growth, more\r\nreadily yield to the resisting forces of the cell life of the\r\nbody. Possibly the resisting forces are decidedly increased by the\r\nreactive effect of the bacteria and their poisons. But, at all\r\nevents, in cases where recovery from parasitic diseases occurs,\r\nthe revived powers of resistance finally overcome the bacteria,\r\ndestroy them or drive them off, and the body recovers.\r\n\r\nAll this is, of course, a natural process. The recovery from a\r\ndisease produced by the invasion of parasitic bacteria depends\r\nupon whether the body can resist the bacterial poisons long enough\r\nfor the recuperation of its resisting powers. If these poisons are\r\nvery violent and produced rapidly, death will probably occur\r\nbefore the resisting powers are strong enough to drive off the\r\nbacteria. In the case of some diseases the poisons are so violent\r\nthat this practically always occurs, recovery being very\r\nexceptional. The poison produced by the tetanus bacillus is of\r\nthis nature, and recovery from lockjaw is of the rarest\r\noccurrence. But in many other diseases the body is able to\r\nwithstand the poison, and later to recover its resisting powers\r\nsufficiently to drive off the invaders. In all cases, however, the\r\nprocess is a natural one and dependent upon the vital activity of\r\nthe body. It is based at the foundation, doubtless, upon the\r\npowers of the body cells, either the phagocytes or other active\r\ncells. The body has, in short, its own forces for repelling\r\ninvasions, and upon these forces must we depend for the power to\r\nproduce recovery.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that all these facts give us very little\r\nencouragement that we shall ever be able to cure diseases directly\r\nby means of drugs to destroy bacteria, but, on the contrary, that\r\nwe must ever depend upon the resisting powers of the body. They\r\nteach us, moreover, along what line we must look for the future\r\ndevelopment of curative medicine. It is evident that scientific\r\nmedicine must turn its attention toward the strengthening and\r\nstimulating of the resisting and curative forces of the body. It\r\nmust be the physician's aim to enable the body to resist the\r\npoisons as well as possible and to stimulate it to re-enforce its\r\nresistant forces. Drugs have a place in medicine, of course, but\r\nthis place is chiefly to stimulate the body to react against its\r\ninvading hosts. They are, as a rule, not specific against definite\r\ndiseases. We can not hope for much in the way of discovering\r\nspecial medicines adapted to special diseases. We must simply look\r\nupon them as means which the physician has in hand for stimulating\r\nthe natural forces of the body, and these may doubtless vary with\r\ndifferent individual natures. Recognising this, we can see also\r\nthe logic of the small dose as compared to the large dose. A small\r\ndose of a drug may serve as a stimulant for the lagging forces,\r\nwhile a larger dose would directly repress them or produce\r\ninjurious secondary effects. As soon as we recognise that the aim\r\nof medicine is not to destroy the disease but rather to stimulate\r\nthe resisting forces of the body, the whole logic of therapeutics\r\nassumes a new aspect.\r\n\r\nPhysicians have understood this, and, especially in recent years,\r\nhave guided their practice by it. If a moderate dose of quinine\r\nwill check malaria in a few days, it does not follow that twice\r\nthe dose will do it in half the time or with twice the certainty.\r\nThe larger doses of the past, intended to drive out the disease,\r\nhave been everywhere replaced by smaller doses designed to\r\nstimulate the lagging body powers. The modern physician makes no\r\nattempt to cure typhoid fever, having long since learned his\r\ninability to do this, at least if the fever once gets a foothold;\r\nbut he turns his attention to every conceivable means of\r\nincreasing the body's strength to resist the typhoid poison,\r\nconfident that if he can thus enable the patient to resist the\r\npoisoning effects of the typhotoxine his patient will in the end\r\nreact against the disease and drive off the invading bacteria. The\r\nphysician's duty is to watch and guard, but he must depend upon\r\nthe vital powers of his patient to carry on alone the actual\r\nbattle with the bacterial invaders.\r\n\r\nANTITOXINES.\r\n\r\nIn very recent times, however, our bacteriologists have been\r\npointing out to the world certain entirely new means of assisting\r\nthe body to fight its battles with bacterial diseases. As already\r\nnoticed, one of the primal forces in the recovery, from some\r\ndiseases, at least, is the development in the body of a substance\r\nwhich acts as an antidote to the bacterial poison. So long as this\r\nantitoxine is not present the poisons produced by the disease will\r\nhave their full effect to weaken the body and prevent the revival\r\nof its resisting powers to drive off the bacteria. Plainly, if it\r\nis possible to obtain this antitoxine in quantity and then\r\ninoculate it into the body when the toxic poisons are present, we\r\nhave a means for decidedly assisting the body in its efforts to\r\ndrive off the parasites. Such an antidote to the bacterial poison\r\nwould not, indeed, produce a cure, but it would perhaps have the\r\neffect of annulling the action of the poisons, and would thus give\r\nthe body a much greater chance to master the bacteria. It is upon\r\nthis principle that is based the use of antitoxines in diphtheria\r\nand tetanus\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that to obtain the antitoxine we must depend upon\r\nsome natural method for its production. We do not know enough of\r\nthe chemical nature of the antitoxines to manufacture them\r\nartificially. Of course we can not deny the possibility of their\r\nartificial production, and certain very recent experiments\r\nindicate that perhaps they may be made by the agency of\r\nelectricity. At present, however, we must use natural methods, and\r\nthe one commonly adopted is simple. Some animal is selected whose\r\nblood is harmless to man and that is subject to the disease to be\r\ntreated. For diphtheria a horse is chosen. This animal is\r\ninoculated with small quantities of the diphtheria poison without\r\nthe diphtheria bacillus. This poison is easily obtained by causing\r\nthe diphtheria bacillus to grow in common media in the laboratory\r\nfor a while, and the toxines develop in quantity; then, by proper\r\nfiltration, the bacteria themselves can be removed, leaving a pure\r\nsolution of the toxic poison. Small quantities of this poison are\r\ninoculated into the horse at successive intervals. The effect on\r\nthe horse is the same as if the animal had the disease. Its cells\r\nreact and produce a considerable quantity of the antitoxine which\r\nremains in solution in the blood of the animal. This is not\r\ntheory, but demonstrated fact. The blood of a horse so treated is\r\nfound to have the effect of neutralizing the diphtheria poison,\r\nalthough the blood of the horse before such treatment has no such\r\neffect. Thus there is developed in the horse's blood a quantity of\r\nthe antitoxine, and now it may be used by physicians where needed.\r\nIf some of this horse's blood, properly treated, be inoculated\r\ninto the body of a person who is suffering from diphtheria, its\r\neffect, provided the theory of antitoxines is true, will be to\r\ncounteract in part, at least, the poisons which are being produced\r\nin the patient by the diphtheria bacillus. This does not cure the\r\ndisease nor in itself drive off the bacilli, but it does protect\r\nthe body from the poisons to such an extent as to enable it more\r\nreadily to assert its own resisting powers.\r\n\r\nThis method of using antitoxines as a help in curing disease is\r\nvery recent, and we can not even guess what may come of it. It has\r\napparently been successfully applied in diphtheria. It has also\r\nbeen used in tetanus with slight success. The same principle has\r\nbeen used in obtaining an antidote for the poison of snake bites,\r\nsince it has appeared that in this kind of poisoning the body will\r\ndevelop an antidote to the poison if it gets a chance. Horses have\r\nbeen treated in the same way as with the diphtheria poison, and in\r\nthe same way they develop a substance which neutralizes the snake\r\npoison. Other diseases are being studied to-day with the hope of\r\nsimilar results. How much further the principle will go we can not\r\nsay, nor can we be very confident that the same principle will\r\napply very widely. The parasitic diseases are so different in\r\nnature that we can hardly expect that a method which is\r\nsatisfactory in meeting one of the diseases will be very likely to\r\nbe adapted to another. Vaccination has proved of value in\r\nsmallpox, but is not of use in other human diseases. Inoculation\r\nwith weakened germs has proved of value in anthrax and fowl\r\ncholera, but will not apply to all diseases. Each of these\r\nparasites must be fought by special methods, and we must not\r\nexpect that a method that is of value in one case must necessarily\r\nbe of use elsewhere. Above all, we must remember that the\r\nantitoxines do not cure in themselves; they only guard the body\r\nfrom the weakening effects of the poisons until it can cure\r\nitself, and, unless the body has resisting powers, the antitoxine\r\nwill fail to produce the desired results.\r\n\r\nOne further point in the action of the antitoxines must be\r\nnoticed. As we have seen, a recovery from an attack of most germ\r\ndiseases renders the individual for a time immune against a second\r\nattack. This applies less, however, to a recovery after the\r\nartificial inoculation with antitoxine than when the individual\r\nrecovers without such aid. If the individual recovers quite\r\nindependently of the artificial antitoxine, he does so in part\r\nbecause he has developed the antitoxines for counteracting the\r\npoison by his own powers. His cellular activities have, in other\r\nwords, been for a moment at least turned in the direction of\r\nproduction of antitoxines. It is to be expected, therefore, that\r\nafter the recovery they will still have this power, and so long as\r\nthey possess it the individual will have protection from a second\r\nattack. When, however, the recovery results from the artificial\r\ninoculation of antitoxine the body cells have not actively\r\nproduced antitoxine. The neutralization of the poisons has been a\r\npassive one, and after recovery the body cells are no more engaged\r\nin producing antitoxine than before. The antitoxine which was\r\ninoculated is soon eliminated by secretion, and the body is left\r\nwith practically the same liability to attack as before. Its\r\nimmunity is decidedly fleeting, since it was dependent not upon\r\nany activity on the part of the body, but upon an artificial\r\ninoculation of a material which is rapidly eliminated by\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the outline which has been given of the bacterial\r\nlife of Nature may serve to give some adequate idea of these\r\norganisms and correct the erroneous impressions in regard to them\r\nwhich are widely prevalent. It will be seen that, as our friends,\r\nbacteria play a vastly more important part in Nature than they do\r\nas our enemies. These plants are minute and extraordinarily\r\nsimple, but, nevertheless, there exists a large number of\r\ndifferent species. The number of described forms already runs far\r\ninto the hundreds, and we do not yet appear to be approaching the\r\nend of them. They are everywhere in Nature, and their numbers are\r\nvast beyond conception. Their powers of multiplication are\r\ninconceivable, and their ability to produce profound chemical\r\nchanges is therefore unlimited. This vast host of living beings\r\nthus constitutes a force or series of forces of tremendous\r\nsignificance. Most of the vast multitude we must regard as our\r\nfriends. Upon them the farmer is dependent for the fertility of\r\nhis soil and the possibility of continued life in his crops. Upon\r\nthem the dairyman is dependent for his flavours. Upon them\r\nimportant fermentative industries are dependent, and their\r\nuniversal powers come into action upon a commercial scale in many\r\na place where we have little thought of them in past years. We\r\nmust look upon them as agents ever at work, by means of which the\r\nsurface of Nature is enabled to remain fresh and green. Their\r\npower is fundamental, and their activities are necessary for the\r\ncontinuance of life. A small number of the vast host, a score or\r\ntwo of species, unfortunately for us, find their most favourable\r\nliving place in the human body, and thus become human parasites.\r\nBy their growth they develop poisons and produce disease. This\r\nsmall class of parasites are then decidedly our enemies. But,\r\ntaken all together, we must regard the bacteria as friends and\r\nallies. Without them we should not have our epidemics, but without\r\nthem we should not exist. Without them it might be that some\r\nindividuals would live a little longer, if indeed we could live at\r\nall. It is true that bacteria, by producing disease, once in a\r\nwhile cause the premature death of an individual; once in a while,\r\nindeed, they may sweep off a hundred or a thousand individuals;\r\nbut it is equally true that without them plant and animal life\r\nwould be impossible on the face of the earth.",
