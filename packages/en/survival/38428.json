Take a\r\npiece of card and punch a little hole through it with the point of a\r\nsmall needle, hold it towards a lamp or a window, and you will see the\r\nlight through it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThis hole will be about the size just mentioned, and you will find that\r\nyou can see it best and most distinctly when you hold it at a certain\r\ndistance from your eye; and this distance will not be far from ten\r\ninches, unless you are near-sighted. Now bring it towards your eye and\r\nyou will find it becomes blurred and indistinct. You will see by this\r\nexperiment that you cannot see things distinctly when held too close to\r\nyour eye, or in other words, that you cannot bring your eye nearer to an\r\nobject than eight or ten inches and see it well at the same time.\r\n\r\nYou could see things much smaller than one hundredth of an inch if you\r\ncould get your eye close enough to them. How can that be done? By a\r\nmicroscope? yes, but what is that? This name comes from two Greek words\r\nthat mean \"to see small things;\" and a microscope is an instrument by\r\nwhich your eye can get very close to what you want to see.\r\n\r\nTo understand this, take out one of your eyes and look at it with the\r\nother one. You see that it is a little round camera; most boys have seen\r\na camera and some boys can make one. The simplest way to do that is to\r\ntake a box, say a cigar box (empty, of course); pull off the cover and\r\nfasten in the place of it a piece of ground glass if you have one: if\r\nnot a piece of white letter paper, oiled, will do; bore a hole in the\r\nmiddle of the bottom with a small gimlet and your camera is done. Point\r\nthe bottom with the hole in it out of the window, and throw a piece of\r\ncloth over your head and over the box, as the photographers do, to shut\r\nout the side light, but mind and not cover up the hole; look at the\r\nground glass (or oiled paper) and you will see things upside down. (Fig.\r\n1.) But what has it to do with my eye? you say. Why, your eye is just\r\nlike it, only round, as in fig. 2. And if you hold a doll or anything\r\nelse about ten inches in front of the eye you have taken out and look at\r\nthe inside of it (the eye, not the doll) just as you look at the ground\r\nglass of your box camera, you will see the doll upside down on the back\r\nof the eye.\r\n\r\nBut how, do you say, can I see things right side up when they are upside\r\ndown in my eye? This is a very good conundrum and it will keep a long\r\ntime, till you are about seventy years old and have spare time to sit\r\ndown and think about it.\r\n\r\nNow you see how your eye is a camera; the pupil is the hole and the\r\nback of the eye, called the retina, is the ground glass.\r\n\r\nBut you will find that the camera you have just made does not show\r\nthings distinctly and beautifully as the photographer's camera does; how\r\ncan they be distinct in the eye then?\r\n\r\nBecause in the photographer's camera, in the hole is a lens, which is a\r\npiece of glass, shaped like a sun glass; and so in your eye just behind\r\nthe pupil is a lens, not made of glass, but still almost as transparent\r\nas if it were. In order to see what effect this lens has, take your box\r\ncamera, make the hole larger and put a lens in it; one of your magic\r\nlantern lenses will do; and if the lens has the right focus you will see\r\nthe images sharp and distinct on your ground glass. The focus probably\r\nwill not be just right, so make a paper tube, into which fasten your\r\nlens and slide the tube in and out of the hole until you find the right\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nWhen you have got that right so that you see a boy on the sidewalk\r\nupside down and see his teeth when he laughs, put some small object, the\r\nlittle doll will do, about three feet in front of your lens, and you\r\nwill find the image of it is blurred and indistinct, and that you must\r\npull your tube out to get the focus on the doll; or if you had another\r\nlens of just the right shape to hold in front of your camera, you would\r\nwith that get the focus on the doll.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThus you can see how it is with your eye, and why you cannot see things\r\ndistinctly held close to it. The lens in the eye can change its shape a\r\nlittle, so that it will focus objects a mile off, or ten inches off, but\r\nit cannot be pushed in and out like the tube in your camera. You can do\r\nthis, however, if you take another lens and hold it outside your eye and\r\nlet the light go through that first before it comes to the lens in your\r\neye, and in this way you can get a focus in your retina, and the outside\r\nlens thus forms a part of that optical instrument called your eye. Does\r\nyour grandma know that her spectacles are a part of the cameras that she\r\ncalls her eyes?\r\n\r\nHow is it that a lens bends (refracts is the big word for it) the rays\r\nof light? You will learn by and by. You can see that it does so by a few\r\nexperiments with your sun glass or any such lens. Hold it between the\r\nsun and a piece of white paper until the white spot in the centre is as\r\nsmall as you can make it. You will see that the rest of the lens casts a\r\nshadow although it is all glass; this is because the rays of sunlight\r\nthat fall on the lens are all bent towards the centre, and so you have a\r\nsmall white spot on which is concentrated the light and the heat, and\r\nbefore you have found out how it is all done, your paper takes fire and\r\nthe experiment ends in smoke.\r\n\r\nTake another piece of paper, and when the white spot is at its smallest,\r\nmeasure the distance between the lens and the paper, and you will have\r\nthe focal distance of the lens.\r\n\r\nYou have now found out how to get your eye close to an object and see\r\nsomething that is very small; this is usually called magnifying it,\r\nbecause it seems to make it look large. Suppose you have a lens that\r\nwill let you see a flea through it held just one inch from it, this lens\r\nis now an addition to your eye, as we measure from the lens. If you had\r\nanother flea held ten inches off, so big that it would just be hidden by\r\nthe little flea, the one farthest off would be ten times as large as the\r\nnear one. (Fig. 3.) In this case it is said that the lens having a focal\r\nlength of one inch magnifies ten times, or has a power of ten.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe shortest usual distance of objects seen distinctly being taken as\r\nten inches, microscopists have agreed to consider that as the standard\r\nof measurement, and objects seen through a lens are considered magnified\r\nto the size they would have if projected ten inches off, like our little\r\nflea.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE OUTFIT.\r\n\r\nNow that we have got hold of the idea that the eye is an optical\r\ninstrument, and that to increase its capacity for seeing small things we\r\nadd to it other optical contrivances, making with it one instrument\r\ncomposed of several parts, let us look at such additions more\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--OPEN AND CLOSED.]\r\n\r\nOne pleasant September afternoon, three gentlemen were strolling along\r\nthe banks of the Wissahickon, in Philadelphia's beautiful park, and\r\nstopping now and then to examine some little flower or insect with\r\npocket lenses, when they discovered that some little boys out for a\r\nholiday were watching their proceedings with a curious and mystified\r\ninterest. One of the gentlemen had a pocket microscope with three lenses\r\nof different sizes, as in Fig. 1. Calling the boys up to him he showed\r\nthem a little flower magnified. They had never dreamed of such a sight,\r\nand their wonder and amazement were as great as if they suddenly beheld\r\na new world. You will be as surprised as they were when you take your\r\nfirst peep, but you must learn to see such things _by yourselves_. The\r\nfirst thing you need is a simple microscope, that is, one with a single\r\nlens, small enough to be carried in the pocket. There are different\r\nforms and sizes of such microscopes, varying in quality and price. Those\r\nlike the one just mentioned are made with from one to four lenses each,\r\nand are perhaps the most generally useful. Then there is the Coddington\r\nlens (Fig. 2) which is still more compact; and it is sometimes made in\r\nthe form of Fig. 3. It has a very short focus, and is not, therefore,\r\nvery easy to use. Achromatic doublets and triplets are made of two or\r\nmore lenses cemented together and mounted in the same style as the\r\nCoddington lens; they are very much better than the Coddington, but are\r\nmore expensive.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThere are several devices for mounting these simple microscopes on\r\nstands so that they can be kept steady and the objects to be examined\r\nplaced behind them. One of these is illustrated in Fig. 4. An ingenious\r\nboy with a block of wood for a base, some stout wire and corks, can make\r\none almost as useful, though not so handsome.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nA more elaborate form is shown in Fig. 5. It has a glass stage to hold\r\ntransparent objects, and a brass one for opaque objects, and a mirror\r\nbelow to reflect light up through transparent objects.\r\n\r\nIt is much better to use a good simple microscope than a poor and cheap\r\ncompound one; be sure and remember this and not be enticed to buy such\r\nan one by any representations as to its great magnifying power.\r\n\r\nA compound microscope is one with a tube from four to ten inches long,\r\nan arrangement for holding the object to be looked at, and a mirror\r\nbelow to reflect light upon or through it. The lenses at the end next\r\nthe object are small, and are set in a small brass tube, which is called\r\nan \"objective.\" It screws into the large tube. The lenses at the end of\r\nthe large tube next the eye are set in a tube, called the eye-piece,\r\nwhich slides in and out of the large tube. Different objectives contain\r\nlenses of different sizes according to the magnifying power desired, and\r\nthey are named \"two inch,\" \"one inch,\" \"half inch,\" and so on down to\r\n\"one seventy-fifth.\" Eye-pieces are sometimes named \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,\" but\r\nmore properly \"two inch,\" and so on down to \"one eighth.\" There is a\r\nvery great variety in the forms of compound microscopes, from the very\r\nsimple up to the very elaborate, and the prices vary accordingly. A\r\nsimple but useful form is given in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nA great deal of money can be expended on a microscope and the various\r\ninstruments made to use with it and which are called \"accessory\r\napparatus\"; but it is best not to buy these instruments until you know\r\njust what you want, and not to spend much money at first except under\r\nthe advice of a \"microscopist.\"\r\n\r\nSome simple things, however, you will need at once, such as a few slips\r\nof glass three inches long and one inch wide, called \"glass slides,\"\r\nsome pieces of very thin glass, called \"cover glass,\" a pair of\r\ntweezers, some needles fastened into pen-holders for handles, and a few\r\nglass tubes commonly called \"pipettes,\" or \"dipping tubes.\" These can be\r\nreadily bought, and some of them easily made.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CATCHING ANIMALCULA WITH A PIPETTE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--OBJECTS.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you have a microscope you will begin to look at everything\r\nand anything: dust, crumbs of bread, flour, starch, mosquitoes, flies,\r\nand moth millers in their season; flowers and leaves, cotton, wool, and\r\nsilk. But this scattering kind of observation will soon weary you. In\r\norder to get the greatest pleasure and best results from your work, you\r\nmust proceed with some system.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BULL'S EYE LENS.]\r\n\r\nThere are so many objects visible only through the microscope that life\r\nis not long enough for you to see them all, much less to study them.\r\nSome microscopists devote the time they have for such studies to the\r\nobservation of single classes of objects; the physician observes the\r\nvarious parts of the animal structure, and calls his work \"histology;\"\r\nthe botanist examines the vegetable kingdom; the entomologist, insects;\r\nbut in all these departments there are numerous subdivisions. As a guide\r\nto your work, you will find some book on the microscope very useful; the\r\nbest one is _The Microscope and its Revelations_, by Dr. William B.\r\nCarpenter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FLY'S EYE--5 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\nObjects through which you can see light are called \"transparent,\" and\r\nare the easiest to look at with the microscope, because you can lay them\r\non a glass slide and throw light up through them with your mirror. Thick\r\nobjects through which light cannot pass are called \"opaque,\" and are\r\nmore difficult to examine, and can only be seen with low powers and a\r\nbright light.\r\n\r\nIn order to see such objects in the evening, you will need a \"bull's\r\neye\" lens mounted on a stand, which you can place beside your microscope\r\nand between the lamp and the stage, condensing the light of the lamp on\r\nthe object. (_Fig. 1._) There are other methods of illuminating opaque\r\nobjects, but they are expensive and difficult to manage, yet by and by\r\nif you persevere in this delightful occupation you will learn what they\r\nare.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Scale of Butterfly\r\n  MAGNIFIED 200 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HEAD OF MOSQUITO. MAGNIFIED 15 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\nSome persons will expect you to show them a fly as big as a horse; but\r\nyou will soon be able to prove to them that you know more about the\r\nmatter than they do. With a large hand-lens, you can see a whole fly at\r\nonce and magnify it two or three times; but when you put it on the stage\r\nof your compound microscope and try to magnify it still more, you will\r\nfind that you can only see a part of it at a time, and the higher the\r\npower you use, the less can you see; in other words, the more you\r\nmagnify an object, the smaller is the field of view.\r\n\r\nAn inch-objective will show the head of an housefly, which in a bright\r\nlight is a very beautiful object. No picture can equal the delicacy of\r\nthe color of the eyes of a live fly.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SECTION OF WOOD.\r\n  MAGNIFIED 50 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\nAfter a little practise you will be able to separate the different parts\r\nof insects and look at them with higher powers. The moth fly will soon\r\nbe on the wing, and your aunt will not call you cruel if you kill and\r\ncut up large numbers of them. Put a little of the dust that comes off\r\nfrom the wing of a moth on a glass slide, look at it with a high power,\r\nand you will find that each particle of dust is a pretty leaf-like\r\nscale. You have seen in summer the dust on the wings of butterflies;\r\nremember this, and look at this butterfly dust with your microscope.\r\n\r\nFlowers and leaves you can always easily obtain; but in looking at them\r\nyou must remember what has already been said about \"transparent\" and\r\n\"opaque\" objects.\r\n\r\nThin slices or sections of stems, leaves, and portions of flowers, can\r\nbe made with a sharp knife, and examined as transparent objects, so that\r\nthus you can observe the internal or cellular structure of the vegetable\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--HOME EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nDuring the cold weather it is not pleasant to make excursions into the\r\ncountry and search for objects for the microscope; so you will look\r\nabout and see what you can find at home; and if you live in Boston,\r\nCochituate water will invite your inspection. The best way to get at the\r\nminute objects in this or any water that is supplied through pipes, is\r\nto make a bag of cotton cloth, not too fine, well washed in water\r\nwithout soap, about a foot long, large enough at the top to slip over a\r\nfaucet that has a screw on it (like the common kitchen faucet adapted\r\nfor a filter), so that it can be tied with a string, and small enough at\r\nthe bottom to be tied on to the neck of a small bottle such as is used\r\nfor homoeopathic pills. This bag should taper gradually in size from\r\nthe top to the bottom. (_Fig. 1._)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: The Water Flea\r\n  FIG. 2. CYCLOPS QUADRICORNIS. MAGNIFIED 20 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3. CANTHOCAMPTUS MINUTUS. 40 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\nIf there is a strong head of water where your faucet is, you must reduce\r\nthe pressure by opening other faucets on the same floor, such as those\r\nin the laundry, otherwise many of the small creatures will be crushed in\r\nthe interstices of the bag. Now let the water run. The bag will swell\r\nout and the water ooze through its sides, and all objects too small to\r\npass through it will fall down and settle in the little bottle at the\r\nbottom. When you see that there is a considerable amount of sediment in\r\nthe bottle, shut off the water and gently squeeze the bag between your\r\nthumb and forefinger, beginning at the top and moving your hand down\r\ntowards the bottle. This movement will cause much of the sediment that\r\nhas adhered to the sides of the bag to fall down. Now untie your bottle\r\nand set it aside and let the water run through the bag to clean it. If\r\nyou have a filter attached to your kitchen faucet you can get a very\r\ngood idea of the solid contents of the water by unscrewing it, or\r\nturning it over if it is made so as to reverse, and letting the sediment\r\nthat has collected on it drip into a tumbler, but the bag gives much\r\nbetter results, as many of the delicate forms that live in the water are\r\ncrushed to death on the filter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4. CHYDORUS SPHOERICUS. 50 DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\nHaving got the sediment in either a tumbler or a bottle, you must make\r\nyour first observation on it with the naked eye by holding it up to the\r\nlight and looking through it. You will find it of a brown color, because\r\na large part of it consists of particles of earth and decayed vegetable\r\nmatter, but you will presently see many little white specks moving about\r\nwith a jumping or hopping movement. These are commonly called\r\n\"water-fleas,\" on account of their peculiar movements, but the name is\r\nmisleading, as they belong to the crustacea (animals having a shell or\r\ncrust like the lobster), and not to the insects.\r\n\r\nThey are found abundantly in ponds and ditches, and in salt water.\r\nSometimes they are so abundant in drinking water that has not been\r\nfiltered, as to alarm a timid person, but you will find them just as\r\ngood to eat raw as they are cooked. The most common of these little\r\ncreatures is the _Cyclops Quadricornis_, so called because he has one\r\neye and four horns. (_Fig. 2._)\r\n\r\nThis picture represents a female, and she carries her eggs in the two\r\nlittle black bags that you see fastened on each side of the abdomen. You\r\nwill find it very interesting by and by to watch the eggs hatch and see\r\nthe little cyclops hop away. When young they do not look much like their\r\nparents; they are rounder and their legs are more prominent. The female\r\ncyclops (the male is comparatively rare) is the most common creature in\r\nCochituate water, and as it is constantly eating, it helps to purify the\r\nwater, and, in its turn, is eaten by the fishes.\r\n\r\nIn swimming it contracts its four horns and its fringed feet with a\r\nquick movement that throws it forward through the water with a leap.\r\n\r\nIts one eye is of a brilliant red, and is a beautiful object under the\r\nmicroscope. The shell also is sometimes beautifully colored, and is\r\noften transparent, so that the internal organs are plainly visible\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nAnother of the family of _Cyclopidae_ is the _Canthocamptus minutus_\r\n(_fig. 3_), which you see is longer and more tapering in its form than\r\nthe _Cyclops Quadricornis_. It is also very common and very active.\r\n\r\n_Chydorus Sphoericus_ (_fig. 4_) is a very pretty round form\r\ninteresting to study when transparent.\r\n\r\nAll these and some others with rather hard names are in that division of\r\nthe _Crustacea_ called _Entomostraca_, meaning shelled creatures whose\r\nshells are cut and do not cover them all round. On this principle, an\r\noyster on the half-shell might be called an _Entomostracan_.\r\n\r\nNow to catch these lively fellows, you must take a dipping tube and be\r\npatient, and when you have got one in the tube, carefully drop it on the\r\nbottom of the \"live-box\" (_fig. 5_), and put on the cover. Examine it\r\nfirst with the lowest power you have. By careful management of the cover\r\nyou can catch it between the top and bottom without breaking the shell,\r\nand in this prison you can study it at leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--COCHITUATE WATER.\r\n\r\nYou have read or been told that if you look at a drop of water through a\r\nmicroscope you will find it full of animalculae, and showmen will\r\nsometimes exhibit water containing _entomostraca_ hopping about, and\r\nwill try to persuade you that all water looks in the same way.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ROTIFER VULGARIS.]\r\n\r\nBut this is a common mistake, as you will soon find out for yourselves.\r\nWater such as is commonly used for drinking purposes, whether it comes\r\nfrom a well, spring, river, or pond, contains but little animal or\r\nvegetable life in proportion to its quantity; you may place drop after\r\ndrop under the microscope without finding anything visible, and you can\r\nonly tell what is in it by filtering a great deal of it. Water standing\r\nin ditches or pools for a long time, becomes full of growth of various\r\nkinds, and is then so discolored and slimy that no one would think of\r\ndrinking it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CARAPACE OF ANURAE STIPITATA.]\r\n\r\nLet us return to the little bottle which you filled with Cochituate\r\nfilterings last month. Take a little from the bottom with your\r\ndipping-tube; put it in the live box and examine it with a half-inch\r\nobjective. You will see many forms that are strange to you, and we will\r\nsuppose that the first is that of one of the rotifers. These little\r\ncreatures are called by this name because of two Latin words meaning\r\nwheel-carriers, for on their heads they have an arrangement which looks\r\nlike a wheel, sometimes in rapid motion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FLOSCULARIA ORNATA.]\r\n\r\nThe most common kind is called _Rotifer vulgaris_ (_fig. 1_), and is a\r\nvery interesting and elastic being. Sometimes he is gloomy and draws\r\nhimself in so that he looks like a ball; then he will stretch out full\r\nlength, and opening his wheel, shoot through the water with great speed.\r\nAgain he will attach his tail to some fixed object, and by the aid of\r\nhis wheel draw a rapid current of water through his mouth; it is thus\r\nthat you can best observe him, and by and by you will discover that the\r\napparent wheel is only a result of the rapid sweeping movement of the\r\nlong hairs or cilia which fringe the opening in the top of the head.\r\nThrough this opening the water passes, the rotifer gathers his food from\r\nthe current, and the food passes into the mastax, where it is ground by\r\nthe masticating apparatus, which is easily seen in motion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DINOBRYON TORTULARIA.]\r\n\r\nThere are several different rotifers found in Cochituate water; among\r\nthem the most common is the _Anurae Stipitata_. (_Fig. 2._) It is like a\r\nturtle, with a shell, or carapace, beautifully ornamented. You will see\r\nplenty of these empty shells, and sometimes you will find one inhabited,\r\nwhen you will see that the creature has a bright red eye, and several\r\nbundles of cilia, in front of the projecting spires.\r\n\r\nOne of the families of the rotifers is called _Floscularia_, because it\r\nresembles a flower; it is attached at the base to small plants, or algae,\r\nand occupies a sheath so transparent that it is hardly visible. One\r\nspecies is occasionally found in the Cochituate, the _Floscularia\r\nornata_. (_Fig. 3._) It is a beautiful object, with its elongated\r\nradiating cilia, which remain quiet, and do not vibrate. The specimen\r\nfigured has three eggs attached to its stem.\r\n\r\nYou will find other rotifers in the Cochituate, some formed like vases,\r\nothers with long spires, but all graceful and beautiful. The _Dinobryon\r\nTortularia_ is sometimes very common in this water.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1881, when the taste of the water was very bad, the\r\n_Dinobryon_ was very abundant, though we do not know that it had\r\nanything to do with the bad taste. You will see by the figure, that it\r\nis like a tree, with an individual of the family at the end of every\r\nbranch. Each one has its own organs of existence, although attached to\r\nits brothers by its stem. Each has a bright red eye, and a long slender\r\nwhip, called a _flagellum_, with which it lashes the water, and when all\r\nthe _flagellae_ are in motion, the whole tree swims about. The\r\nindividuals are very small indeed, and it will take your best objective\r\nto show the _flagellum_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: VORTICELLA NEBULIFERA.]\r\n\r\nAnother tree-like group is that of the _Vorticella_, of which you will\r\nsometimes find in the Cochituate, the species _Vorticella nebulifera_.\r\nEach animal is at the top of a stem, and this stem has the peculiar\r\nproperty of being able to coil up and draw its head down close to the\r\nbottom. This appears to be a defensive movement, for whenever a big ugly\r\ncreature comes by, down go the whole family so quickly that your eye\r\ncannot follow the movement. Sometimes they will all bob down when you\r\ntap the stage of the microscope so as to jar them. At a certain period\r\nof its life the animal suddenly leaves its stem, and goes swimming about\r\nwith great speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--INTERESTING OBJECTS.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STEPHANODISCUS NIAGARAE.]\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful of the small _algae_ or water plants are the\r\n_Diatomaceae_ and the _Desmidiaceae_, sometimes called for brevity diatoms\r\nand desmids. They are remarkable for the geometrical character of their\r\nforms, consisting of circles, triangles and polygons of infinite\r\nvariety. They are very small, and cannot be satisfactorily seen with an\r\nobjective of less power than a four tenths. The diatoms are found\r\neverywhere in both fresh and salt water, but the desmids live only in\r\nfresh water. One of the most common diatoms in Cochituate water is the\r\n_Stephanodiscus Niagarae_. (_Fig. 1._) It is in shape like a pill box,\r\nand its sides, which would be called its top and bottom if it were a\r\npill box, are beautifully ornamented with dots in radiating lines with a\r\nring of spines near the edge. This circle of spines or thorns explains\r\nits name, _Stephanodiscus_, from the proto-martyr, Saint Stephen. The\r\nname _Niagarae_ is from Niagara River, where it was found. Like all\r\ndiatoms, it contains when alive a yellowish brown matter with small\r\nglobules of oil, which is called _endochrome_. The box or shell, called\r\n_pustule_, is of silex or quartz, and is therefore almost\r\nindestructible; and when the diatom dies, sinks to the bottom of the\r\nwater. In this way beds of shells of diatoms are sometimes formed of\r\nconsiderable thickness.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ASTERIONELLA BLEAKLEYII.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TABELLARIA FENESTRATA.]\r\n\r\nUnder the city of Richmond, Va., there is such a deposit, varying from\r\nten to twenty feet in depth, and extending for many miles. Some of the\r\ndiatoms, especially those shaped like a boat, called _Navicula_, have a\r\npeculiar motion which at one time led observers to think them animals.\r\nNo one knows how this motion is produced, and if you can find this\r\nout, you will make a very important discovery. The most common diatom in\r\nCochituate water is _Asterionella Bleakleyii_. It resembles a star with\r\nrays, or the hub and spokes of a wheel. (_Fig. 2._) This diatom is often\r\nfound in abundance in the water supplies of cities. It never forms a\r\ncomplete circle, but grows into spirals or whorls which easily break up.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SPONGILLA FLUVIATILIS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DESMIDIUM SWARTZII. FRONT AND SIDE VIEW.]\r\n\r\nAnother diatom common in Cochituate is _Tabellaria Fenestrata_, which\r\ngrows in ribbon-like forms. (_Fig. 3._) The desmids resemble the diatoms\r\nin the geometrical character of their forms, but they have no shell of\r\nsilex, and are therefore easily destroyed. They are readily\r\ndistinguished at sight by the beautiful green color of the contained\r\nmatter. In many of them there is a curious circulation of small\r\nparticles, especially in the ends of those of a crescent or new-moon\r\nshape. This circulation can only be seen with a high power. Desmids are\r\neasily found in ponds and ditches; and there are several species in\r\nCochituate. Among them is _Desmidium Swartzii_ (_fig. 4_), and\r\n_Closterium moniliferum_. (_Fig. 5._) Their beauty depends so much on\r\ncolor that they do not appear to advantage in the figures. You will find\r\nin examining the filterings of Cochituate water, many objects which have\r\nnot been described in these papers, and among them many fragments of\r\ngreen filaments of the small plants belonging to the _confervae_ and the\r\n_oscillatoriae_; sometimes you will find small round opaque forms of\r\nbrown or green color, which are probably spores of plants of a larger\r\ngrowth; sometimes you will see the pollen of pine-trees which has fallen\r\ninto the water and looks like three small balls fastened together;\r\nsometimes, though rarely, you may find one of those curious little\r\ncreatures called water bears, or _tardigrada_; and you may be fortunate\r\nenough to catch a water spider.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CLOSTERIUM MONILIFERUM.]\r\n\r\nBut you will often see the _spiculae_ of the sponge, called _Spongilla\r\nfluviatilis_. They look like pins of glass, blunt at one end and\r\npointed at the other, and are sometimes very abundant. You may have\r\nheard that this sponge has been considered the source of the\r\noccasionally bad taste and smell of Cochituate water. When it is alive,\r\nit is not disagreeable, but when it decays it imparts to the water a\r\nvery unpleasant taste and odor. It certainly is one cause of the bad\r\nquality of the water, but whether it is entitled to the sole credit is\r\nstill open to question.\r\n\r\nYou can see what it looks like in _fig. 6_. When alive, it is of a\r\nlight-green color, but when decayed it becomes brown. It is full of the\r\n_spiculae_ above described, which serve to stiffen it, but it easily\r\ncrumbles and scatters them through the water.\r\n\r\nThough the microscope shows us many beautiful and interesting objects,\r\nyet in the present state of our knowledge we cannot ascertain by its use\r\nwhether the water we examine is harmless or injurious.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--THE BRICKMAKER.\r\n\r\nThe microscope reveals so many strange odd-looking water creatures and\r\nplants that we can easily imagine ourselves transported to some new\r\nworld. Look at this field of view as seen through the microscope. In the\r\ncentre stands a brickmaker. He is a queer little animal, and so small\r\nthat he looks like a mere speck to the naked eye, but through the\r\nmicroscope we see how wonderfully curious and strange a creature he is.\r\nHe is no idle, lazy fellow. He is instead a most busy mechanic.\r\n\r\nJust now he is building a house out of tiny bricks, and he manufactures\r\nthe bricks himself, making them one at a time, and when one is finished\r\nhe lays it down carefully by the side of the last, and fastens it firmly\r\nin its place with a kind of cement. The bricks are laid in regular tiers\r\none above the other.\r\n\r\nWe find these brickmakers in still water where various water-plants\r\ngrow, especially the water-milfoil and bladderwort. They seem to be\r\nsocial beings. They live in large communities, attaching their houses to\r\nthe stems and leaves of the plants so thickly sometimes that they almost\r\ntouch one another. They look, to the naked eye, like lines about one\r\neighth of an inch in length. Sometimes they are very thick on the plants\r\nin New Jersey ponds.\r\n\r\nIf you take some of the plants and water, and put them in a bottle, you\r\ncan carry a large number of the brickmakers home, where you can watch\r\nthem at your leisure. Take a glass slide which has a little cup-shaped\r\nhollow to hold a few drops of water, and put a tiny piece of the plant\r\nwith the house attached into this hollow and fill it with some of the\r\nwater from the bottle. Now cover it with a very thin piece of glass and\r\nlay it over the stage of the microscope, and it is ready to be looked at\r\nand studied. You will look with both eyes, for your microscope is a\r\nbinocular--one that has two tubes to look through. The size of the\r\nobjects will depend upon the magnifying power you have chosen.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you see is a dark, brick-colored, cylinder-shaped house\r\nwhich looks to be about the size of a cigar. The little builder who\r\nlives in this house has been disturbed by the means we have taken to\r\nmake his acquaintance; he has stopped work and gone within. But he is so\r\nindustrious a fellow that he will not remain within very long. As soon\r\nas it is quite still he will probably come to the door of his house, and\r\nyou will see him thrust out two horns. He will move these horns to the\r\nright and left, cautiously feeling all around him. He seems very\r\ncautious indeed. But at last he is satisfied that no enemy is near. Now\r\nhe ventures out. He unfolds his wheels.\r\n\r\nThese wheels are surrounded with a band of _cilia_, or flexible hairs,\r\nwhich he can put in rapid motion, making the wheels have the appearance\r\nof revolving very fast. This rapid motion of the cilia forms a swift\r\ncurrent in the water; and this current brings tiny particles of various\r\nthings to the little mechanic. Some of these particles he uses for food;\r\nof others, he makes brick. They are carried into an opening between the\r\nwheels where you can see them revolving very fast until they are\r\ngathered into a little round, dark-colored pellet. The particles are\r\nprobably held together by a sticky secretion made by the builder.\r\n\r\nIt takes him about three minutes to make a brick. As soon as it is\r\nfinished, he bends his head over, takes it from its mould between the\r\nwheels, and lays it down carefully by the side of the last. Then he\r\nraises his head and begins to make another. The tube thus constructed is\r\nquite firm and strong. Sometimes when I have found a long tube, I have\r\ncut off a portion from the top. This can be done, with care, for the\r\nbrickmaker drops to the bottom when disturbed. It is very amusing to\r\nwatch him repair damages and rebuild. Sometimes I have forced one out of\r\nhis tube, but it always soon died. But though industrious, he is so\r\ncautious, or timid, that he is easily frightened, and therefore he is\r\noften interrupted in his work. For instance, like some people that we\r\nknow, he is very afraid of snakes. If a harmless little tiny snake comes\r\nwriggling along through the water anywhere near him, he folds his wheels\r\nand drops down into his house as quick as a flash. One day a little boy\r\nwas delighted with the fast-revolving wheels. Suddenly, by and by, he\r\nturned toward me with great disgust plainly showing in his face: \"He's\r\ngone in, 'fraid of a little snake!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGURE 1, BRICKMAKER; 2, CURRENT IN WATER; 3, 4, 5, 6,\r\n  DIATOMS; 7, 8, DESMIDS; 9, ALGAE; 10, 11, TRICHODA LYNCEUS; 12,\r\n  SNAKE-LIKE LARVA; 13, PART OF PLANT TO WHICH BRICKMAKER IS ATTACHED;\r\n  14, BATRACHOSPERMUM MONILIFORM.]\r\n\r\nHe is always a great favorite with those who have watched him through\r\nthe microscope. I do not know how long they live, but I have kept the\r\nsame individuals three months or more. I think no one knows the entire\r\nlife-history of any of these little creatures, so here is a grand chance\r\nfor any young microscopist to investigate and become famous.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the brickmaker in our field of view is a delicate,\r\nbeautiful plant. Only a small part of it is seen in the engraving. It\r\nhas a long, floating stem, thickly set with rosettes of a pearly green\r\ncolor. To the naked eye it looks like green slime, and is called \"frog's\r\nspawn;\" but the microscope shows us that it is a lovely plant, and some\r\nwise man has given us a long fine name to call it by if we\r\nchoose--_Batrachospermum moniliform_. Let us see if this long name has\r\nany meaning: _Batrachia_, a frog, _spermum_, spawn; ah, after all, only\r\nanother name for frog spawn! The other name, _moniliform_, means a\r\nbead-like necklace; and this was given it because the threads that make\r\nthe rosettes look like strings of small pearly-green beads.\r\n\r\nAll of the strange-looking plants and animals that we see in the\r\nmicroscope are known as well by sight and by name by those who make them\r\na study, as are the larger animals and plants that we see around us\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nA bright little girl once asked me why such long hard names are given to\r\neverything in nature. We told her if there was but one language spoken\r\nin the world there would be no need of using Latin names. But as there\r\nare many languages, it was found necessary to agree upon some system, so\r\nthat all peoples of different nations might have the same name for an\r\nanimal or plant, and a long time ago all the civilized world agreed to\r\nuse Latin names. Thus our little brickmaker is known all over the world\r\nas _Melicerta ringens_.\r\n\r\n\"A field of view\" depends for its interest and variety upon what kind of\r\nwater we put under the microscope. In the one here represented, I first\r\ntook a tiny spray of plant with a brickmaker's house attached, and laid\r\nit on the hollow glass slide and then used the dipping-tube and brought\r\nup some of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle; this proved to\r\ncontain several singular-looking plants and animals shown here.\r\n\r\n_Figures_ 3, 4, 5 and 6, are diatoms, and _figures_ 7 and 8 are\r\ndesmids. Naturalists formerly placed both diatoms and desmids in the\r\nanimal kingdom, but now all agree that the desmids are plants, while\r\nsome few still maintain that the diatoms are animals. But the weight of\r\nevidence is on the plant side of the question.\r\n\r\nThe desmids are wonderfully beautiful plants; the markings and colors\r\nare exquisite. A number of species are found in the sediment of every\r\nswamp and pond.\r\n\r\nThe diatoms often grow in long ribbon-like masses (_fig. 3_), and then\r\npartially separate, remaining joined together at the angles so as to\r\nform a zigzag chain as seen at _figure 4_. They have the power of moving\r\nthrough the water, changing their places like animals.\r\n\r\nA great variety of forms are found, both diatoms and desmids, many still\r\nundescribed, inviting the young microscopist to study and name them.\r\n\r\n_Figures_ 10 and 11 are different forms of a little animal, _Trichoda\r\nlynceus_. It undergoes a great many changes. In some of its stages, it\r\nlooks so different from the figures here represented that you would\r\nnever dream of its being the same creature.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--THE VORTICELLAS.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CARCHESIUM POLYPINUM.]\r\n\r\nThe tree-vorticellas must ever stand first among all the varied and\r\nbeautiful objects which the microscope reveals. A species common in New\r\nEngland and the Middle States is known scientifically by the name of\r\n_Carchesium Polypinum_. It is impossible to convey a true idea of its\r\nbeauty from a dead black and white drawing. To be appreciated it must be\r\nseen in all its living glory--charming little animals resembling\r\nbell-shaped lilies on the ends of lovely transparent stems.\r\n\r\nHow curious nature is in the microscopic world! Only think of a tree of\r\nliving animals! The stems of the tree are jointed, and the little\r\ncreatures can sway the branches about and even throw them into a spiral\r\ncoil so as to bring themselves near the main stem. This gives them the\r\nappearance of being very polite toward each other; they bow and courtesy\r\nas if preparing for a grand quadrille, and they are decked out in gay\r\ncolors, red, green, and yellow. The margins of the little cups are\r\nfringed with hairs, or _cilia_, which they can put in such rapid motion\r\nthat it makes a current in the water and brings little particles to\r\ntheir mouths which they consume as food. They do not accept everything\r\nthat comes in the current. They seem to know what they like as well as\r\nthe higher animals, and act as if they were vexed with some of the\r\nparticles, rejecting and sending them off with a rapid whirling motion.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these fairy-like trees are visible to the naked eye, but\r\nit will be necessary for a novice in such matters to use a good strong\r\nlens to be able to find them readily. They are attached to plants\r\ngrowing in water. I have always been most successful in finding them\r\namong the water-milfoil (_Myriophillum_) several species of which grow\r\nin New England and the Middle States. Some of the species are found in\r\ndeep water, others in shallow ponds.\r\n\r\nThe Bladderworts (_Utricularia_) are also good plants to search among.\r\nThey grow in similar places. On either of these plants we shall be sure\r\nto find a good many interesting creatures. If we fail to find the tree,\r\nwe may secure other species of vorticella, all of which are very\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nDo you know the _Utricularia_? I will devote the next chapter to these\r\ncurious plants, and to the microscopic animals which they capture.\r\n\r\nIt will take a little practice to learn where and how to collect\r\nmaterial for the microscope. We should not depend too much upon books in\r\nany branch of natural history. To be successful, you must observe for\r\nyourselves, experiment and examine independently, consulting books that\r\nyou may name and classify, that you may recognize and name what you\r\nfind. If you fail to find specimens in one spot, try another.\r\n\r\nYou should not fill your collecting bottles more than two thirds full of\r\nwater, nor crowd too many plants in them. These little creatures must\r\nhave air in order to live, as well as the higher animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe finest tree-vorticellas I ever found were in Florida, in the St.\r\nJohn's River. These trees were attached to long, floating stems of\r\n_Myriophillum verticillatum_, and were unlike any species that I ever\r\nfound at the North. They were very large--in a microscopic\r\nsense--plainly visible to the naked eye, and it took only a moderate\r\npower to bring out their beauty.\r\n\r\n_Vorticella nebulifera_ is quite common in swamps and ponds. We find it\r\nattached to a great number of water plants. This species is not built up\r\nin the form of a tree, but it is nevertheless beautiful and graceful.\r\nThe delicate, slender stems start from a node, or rounded mass,\r\nsometimes fifty or more of these fairy like creatures in one colony, all\r\nattached to a common centre, swaying about, coiling their delicate\r\ntransparent stems, and again uncoiling quick as a flash, apparently\r\ndallying and playing, but never interfering nor becoming entangled one\r\nwith another.\r\n\r\nThe _Stentor_ is another member of the _Vorticellinae_ family. It is one\r\nof the largest of the infusoria, plainly visible to the naked eye, and\r\none of the most interesting and curious of all the strange animals in\r\nthe microscopic world. It assumes various forms. When swimming, it looks\r\nround and plump (_Fig. 2_), and rushes through the water pell-mell,\r\nknocking the smaller animals right and left, always seeming to be in a\r\ngreat hurry, unless two friendly ones happen to meet, when they\r\nfrequently stop and put their heads together a moment as if exchanging\r\ngreetings, then away they sail again, dashing through the water,\r\ncapturing and devouring the smaller creatures as they go. And now a\r\ncouple meet that are very communicative--two gossips, no doubt! At all\r\nevents, they put their heads together and conclude to have a good\r\nsociable time.\r\n\r\nAnd they are sensible enough to know that they cannot stand around loose\r\nin the water or public highway. So they select a cosey spot and fasten\r\ntheir feet to a plant or some firm object, and stretch out their\r\nfootstalks sometimes to a great length, making veritable trumpets of\r\nthemselves. (_Fig. 3._)\r\n\r\nAnd who knows what grave matters may be settled during these conclaves?\r\nor perhaps they are only rehearsing gossip, as they have had every\r\npossible chance to see what was going on among their neighbors.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE STENTORS.--\"VERITABLE TRUMPETS.\"]\r\n\r\nSometimes one settles down alone near a group of others, and seems to\r\nproclaim in stentorian voice that it is reception day and he is ready to\r\nreceive. Or perhaps he is simply a herald as his name indicates, whose\r\nbusiness it is to conduct ceremonies and regulate affairs! At any rate,\r\nthough our ears are too dull to catch the voices of these curious beings\r\nof a lower world--so near, and yet in another sense, so far away, it\r\nwould be difficult to believe that these animated creatures have no\r\nmeans of communication and nothing to communicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHROUGH A MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\nBY MARY TREAT\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--THE UTRICULARIA.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that innocent-looking plants should capture and kill\r\nanimals; but this is really what the Bladderworts (_Utricularia_) are\r\nall the time doing. They grow in ponds and swamps, some species in deep,\r\nstill water, others in shallow ponds.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows a portion of the stem of _Utricularia clandestina_, natural\r\nsize. The little bladders are so nearly transparent, that on bringing\r\nthem under the microscope, or even under a good lens, you can see the\r\nnumerous creatures that they have captured, some partly consumed, others\r\nstill alive.\r\n\r\nThe bladders on these curious plants remind one of some of the\r\n_Entomostracans_ which Mr. Wells described in his fourth paper. Look at\r\n_Chydorus sphericus_ for instance, and then at the magnified bladder\r\n(_Fig. 2_) in this article. The branched horns at the mouth or entrance\r\nhave very much the appearance of the antennae of some of the minute\r\nanimals, and the stem when it is attached to the main branch may be\r\nlikened to a tail. But the way in which they capture and devour the\r\npretty little creatures that come within their grasp makes them appear,\r\neven more than they look, like wicked animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1. PORTION OF A STEM OF UTRICULARIA CLANDESTINA;\r\n  NATURAL SIZE.]\r\n\r\nI have found almost every swimming animalculae with which I am\r\nacquainted, caught in these vegetable traps; and when caught they never\r\nescape. Their entrance is easy enough; there is a sensitive valve at the\r\nmouth of the bladder, which, if they touch it, flies open and draws\r\nthem in as quick as a flash. These downward-opening bladders not only\r\nentrap animalculae, but, more wonderful still, the strong larvae of\r\ninsects. The larvae most frequently caught are those of the mosquito and\r\nchironomus. Often the mosquito is caught tail first--the entire body\r\ninclosed and the head left sticking out. It always looks as if the\r\nvictim might walk or wriggle out, but it never does; and you may be sure\r\nthat it never backed in there of its own accord.\r\n\r\nYou all know how the mosquito larva wriggles in the water, and is known\r\nby the common name of \"wriggler,\" or sometimes inaccurately, \"wiggler.\"\r\nNow just as sure as the tail of this wriggler strikes the mouth of the\r\nbladder, just so sure is he caught--drawn in by some unknown power\r\nquicker than you can speak.\r\n\r\nThere is yet much to learn about these curious plants. How it is that\r\nthe valve or trap can so firmly hold these strong larvae is still a\r\nmystery. I have seen a mosquito larva caught by the head when the first\r\njoint of the body was too large to be admitted through the entrance of\r\nthe bladder, and have patiently watched its frantic efforts to escape,\r\nbut it was never released. The more it thrashed about, the tighter grew\r\nthe fatal trap until death put an end to its struggles.\r\n\r\nThe chironomus larva is quite unlike that of the mosquito. The\r\nchironomus has brush-like feet which it can withdraw from sight--a sort\r\nof telescopic arrangement--or extend when it wishes to crawl along the\r\nplants, while the mosquito wriggles and swims.\r\n\r\nThe chironomus is caught more often even than the mosquito larva. At\r\ncertain seasons of the year it is almost impossible to find a bladder\r\nwithout one or more of these victims entrapped.\r\n\r\nThey feed on the water plants, and seem to have a special liking for the\r\nlong-branched antennae which grow at the mouth of the bladders, and, all\r\nunconscious of the trap, on, on they go, their sickle-shaped jaws\r\ncutting the antennae which they eat as they advance, until their heads\r\nreach the mouth of the bladder, when they heedlessly touch the valve and\r\nthe trap is sprung and they are drawn within, never more to escape, but\r\nto be slowly devoured.\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting species of _Utricularia_, the _Purfurea_,\r\nquite different in many particulars from the first. It grows in deep,\r\nstill water. The stems are long, sometimes two feet or more in length,\r\nand the branches radiate in every direction, so that one plant often\r\ncovers quite a large surface of water. The flowering stems stand above\r\nthe water, and each stem bears three or four very pretty violet purple\r\nflowers, and it blossoms nearly all summer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2. BLADDER OF U. CLANDESTINA MAGNIFIED TWENTY\r\n  DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\nThe flowers are about half an inch broad and quite conspicuous. Most of\r\nthe other species have yellow flowers.\r\n\r\nThere are no little thread-like leaves on this species, and the bladders\r\nare on the ends of the little branchlets, and they have no sharp-pointed\r\nantennae as in the other species; but in their place is an elegant\r\ncluster of transparent glassy-like ornamental appendages. The ornaments\r\nare just above the entrance, and who knows but this is a contrivance set\r\nthere to lure unwary creatures into the trap.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common little creatures that was caught in this trap,\r\nwas the _Tardigrada_, or water bear. He looks like a tiny cub, but\r\nunlike his great namesake, he has eight legs, and he frequently slips\r\nout of his old skin and comes out in a new suit.\r\n\r\nI often find them crawling in a forest of these plants, peering out of a\r\nthick jungle--now ascending a branch and out on a limb, holding fast\r\nwith their long claws, and apparently looking around to see what they\r\ncan find.\r\n\r\nNow one seems to be attracted to this elegant glassy cluster of\r\n_Utricularia_. At all events he is soon pushing his head among the\r\ndelicate stems, then stops a moment, standing perfectly still as if\r\nlistening. Perhaps he hears the groans of his dying comrades, but all\r\nunheeding the warning, he steps forward, touches the fatal spring, when\r\nin he goes to perish with his comrades.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3. CHIRONOMUS LARVA: BACK VIEW WITH FEET DRAWN IN\r\n  AND JAWS CLOSED; SIDE VIEW WITH FEET EXTENDED AND JAWS CLOSED.]\r\n\r\nYoung microscopists may like to know that the _Utricularia_ can be\r\npreserved in the house a long time by putting the stems or sprays in an\r\nopen, shallow dish of water where they will grow readily. I have kept\r\nthe plants months together in a large glass dish where they looked\r\ncharmingly beautiful and were the admiration of all who saw them. It is\r\nvery interesting to watch their growth. The ends of the growing sprays\r\nunroll like ferns, and with a magnifying glass you can see the\r\ndevelopment of the little bladders, and you may make discoveries--who\r\nknows? I know that for a long time it was a mystery to me how the\r\nbladders captured and imprisoned the little animals. Every day I saw\r\nthey were entrapped and never escaped, and I studied and pondered over\r\nthe matter a long time, and was so interested and determined to learn\r\nthe secret that I spent night after night looking through the\r\nmicroscope, watching the strange, unwary creatures fall into the trap.\r\n\r\nAt last I concluded to adopt the following plan: I took sprays of the\r\nplants that I had grown in clear water that contained no animalcules, so\r\nthat all the bladders were empty and quite transparent. In another dish\r\nI had put a great many masses of mosquito eggs. Mosquito eggs are found\r\nfloating on almost any standing water, in dark, compact masses. In warm\r\nweather they hatch in a few hours. So you can understand how quickly I\r\ncould swarm a small vessel of water with the mosquito larvae by\r\nintroducing the eggs where I wished them to hatch. When they were\r\nhatched I put some of the water in which was a large number of the tiny\r\ncreatures into the live box with a spray of the plant containing empty\r\nbladders. I placed the box under the microscope and closely watched the\r\nmanner of capture. I became certain that in almost every instance the\r\nlarvae were caught tail first. The tail is brush-like, and when it swept\r\nover the door or valve that leads into the bladder, I saw that the door\r\nwould immediately fly open and always draw the larva in. I soon became\r\nsatisfied that the valve was very sensitive when touched at the right\r\npoint, but to this day I cannot tell what the power is that so quickly\r\ndraws the creatures within. I earnestly hope that some young\r\nmicroscopists will yet be able to ferret out the cause of this singular\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThose who have read Mr. Darwin's very interesting book on _Insectivorous\r\nPlants_, will have noticed that he says the valve of _Utricularia_ is\r\nnot in the least sensitive, and that the little creatures force their\r\nway into the bladders--their heads acting like a wedge. But this is not\r\nthe case, as Mr. Darwin himself was convinced some years before his\r\ndeath. In his usual kind, gracious manner he admitted that he was wrong,\r\nand gracefully says the valve must be sensitive, although he could never\r\nexcite any movement. In a letter to me bearing date June 1st, 1875, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"I have read your article (in _Harpers Magazine_) with the greatest\r\ninterest. It certainly appears from your excellent observations that the\r\nvalve is sensitive.... I cannot understand why I could never with all my\r\npains excite any movement. It is pretty clear I am quite wrong about the\r\nhead acting like a wedge. The indraught of the living larva is\r\nastonishing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--FREE SWIMMING ANIMALCULES.\r\n\r\nThe Brickmaker, Floscules, and Vorticellas are quiet peaceable citizens\r\nof the microscopic world, and seem to be impressed with the graver\r\nduties of life; they set up housekeeping and settle down for life moored\r\nto one spot. But there are many others that live a free-and-easy sort of\r\nlife--a wandering gypsy kind of an existence, always on the move; and\r\nthere is not much satisfaction in trying to follow these rovers if we\r\nwish to make a careful study of their structure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SKELETON WATER WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nSo to be enabled to examine them you will be compelled to imprison them\r\nin the live-box and bring just as much pressure to bear upon them as\r\nthey will stand without crushing, which with careful practice you may\r\nsoon learn to do. But if you are simply making the acquaintance of these\r\nlittle creatures for amusement, it is more interesting and satisfactory\r\nto watch them while they are unrestrained, and see the curious feats\r\nthey perform.\r\n\r\nOne of the most amusing of these little animals is the Skeleton\r\nWheel-bearer (_Dinocharis pocillum_). His portrait is seen at _Figure\r\n1_. He has a long foot consisting of three joints, and these joints are\r\nas perfect as those of our own knees and elbows, and can be moved as\r\neasily forward and sideways, but not backward. The joints and foot are\r\nnot covered with any fleshy substance, from which fact--the joints being\r\nso conspicuous--it probably received the name Skeleton. Two long slender\r\ntoes extend from the last joint, and from the tips of these the Skeleton\r\ncan show us more wonderful feats than any circus performer.\r\n\r\nThe toes can be widely separated, or brought close together, like a pair\r\nof tongs. Sometimes he stands on the tip of one toe and throws his body\r\nforward, or from side to side with a rapid motion; then straightening\r\nhimself up, he stands on the tips of both toes as if posing, remaining\r\nperfectly still for a few moments and giving us an opportunity to take a\r\ngood look at his curious body which is encased in a pretty vase-shaped,\r\nthree-sided transparent shell. The head extends from the top of the\r\nvase, and is surmounted with the usual cilia, or wheel, which we see\r\namong all the rotifera. When he is tired of posing, away he swims in a\r\ngraceful, easy manner, with his long foot straightened out and the toes\r\nbrought close together.\r\n\r\nYou sometimes will find these pretty creatures, especially in\r\nsummer-time, very numerous in the sediment at the bottom of your\r\ncollecting bottles. Often I have found dead specimens, and very\r\nbeautiful objects they sometimes are. Great numbers of tiny scavengers\r\nhave completely cleaned out all of the soft parts of the body in a most\r\nneat and perfect manner, leaving the beautiful shell and vertical\r\ncolumn, that runs through it, and the foot and toes, entire and perfect\r\nin all of their parts.\r\n\r\nThink of the minuteness of these scavengers--untold numbers of them\r\npreying upon the body of an object invisible to the naked eye; and yet\r\nthis body is a mammoth by the side of one of the scavengers! The mind\r\ncan scarcely grasp the minuteness of these tiny creatures--creatures\r\nthat seem to enjoy existence, eating, and apparently playing and\r\nentertaining each other like the higher animals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WHIPTAIL.]\r\n\r\nThe whiptail (_Mastigocerca carinata_) (_Fig. 2_) is another delicate\r\npretty little creature, and, like the skeleton, is encased in a glassy\r\nshell. It has a long, tapering, spine-like foot, or, more properly\r\nspeaking, a toe which is attached to a very short foot by means of a\r\nflexible joint which allows free motion. You often will find him in\r\ncompany with the Skeleton, and they seem to vie with each other in\r\nperforming strange feats. The Whiptail, if possible, looks even more\r\ncomical than the Skeleton when it stands on the tip of its long toe, a\r\ntoe which is longer than the entire length of the body, now bending over\r\nand nibbling at the plants, now whisking around as if looking and\r\ninquiring into some passing object, then sailing through the water with\r\na graceful, easy motion beyond sight.\r\n\r\n_Brachionus pala_ is also a lovely creature encased in a delicate\r\ntransparent shell. It is considerably larger than the Skeleton or\r\nWhiptail, and is just visible to the unassisted eye. If you drop it in a\r\nphial of clear water and hold it up to the light, you can distinctly see\r\nit gliding through the water like a revolving white speck. A moderate\r\npower of the microscope reveals its beauty. The shell is swelled at the\r\nsides, and narrow at the mouth, and round over the back, while the under\r\nside is flat.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LARGE ROTIFER.]\r\n\r\nLike the Skeleton and Whiptail, the head of the little Brachion is seen\r\nprotruding from the upper part of the shell; but instead of one wheel\r\nthis charming little creature has two, and nothing can be more lovely\r\nthan a sight of these fast revolving wheels, like two beautiful crowns.\r\n\r\nThe reason the wheel looks so strikingly beautiful in _Brachionus_ is\r\nowing to the long cilia which is longer in this genus than in other\r\ngenera of this great family.\r\n\r\nThe foot of _Brachionus_ is more curious than that of the Skeleton. It\r\nis telescopic, and the little animal has the most perfect control over\r\nit. He can draw it within the body so that it looks like a ball, and\r\nagain quickly thrust it out and whisk it around in all directions like a\r\ntail. It has two short toes at the end which can be separated or brought\r\ntogether at pleasure. And he can firmly anchor himself by the toes and\r\nstretch forward, showing you the great length of the foot. Now he rolls\r\nfrom side to side without letting go his hold and performs other strange\r\nfeats, and all the while the wheels are rapidly revolving, he has\r\nstopped his headlong career through the water and has settled down to\r\nget his supper.\r\n\r\n_Fig. 3_ represents one of the largest rotifers with which I am\r\nacquainted. I have never been able to find a description or engraving\r\nof it in any work on microscopy. But it is probably well known to\r\nmicroscopists, for it has a wide range. I have found it in New\r\nHampshire, New Jersey and Florida.\r\n\r\nYou cannot get a true idea of its graceful beauty from the drawing, as\r\nit is represented as it was seen in the live box with sufficient\r\npressure upon it to keep it from moving, while serving as a model. And\r\nno engraving, however perfect, can give you any idea of its brilliant\r\ntransparency and delicate coloring.\r\n\r\nThe play of the muscles and internal organs are plainly visible, and you\r\ncan always tell what he has chosen for dinner. Diatoms and desmids form\r\na portion of his diet. His mouth is below the wheel. When he is hungry\r\nhe anchors himself by his forked tail and sets his wheel in rapid\r\nmotion, which makes a powerful current sufficient to bring quite large\r\nobjects to his head, frequently too large to admit into the mouth. He\r\nwill often repeatedly try to take a desmid entirely too large for his\r\nmouth, and his manoeuvres are quite comical as he whirls it round and\r\nround, nipping it on all sides. You will see by looking at the figure\r\nthat everything has to be swallowed or taken within the body before it\r\nreaches the mouth. While the desmid is within the body the rotifer has\r\ncontrol over it sufficient to take it into the mouth if it is of the\r\nright size, but if it is too large he soon becomes disgusted and ejects\r\nit with a sudden movement which sends it whirling rapidly away. And now\r\nhe takes a smaller one and his jaws work vigorously a moment or two,\r\nwhen he swallows it almost entire, and we can plainly see the pretty\r\nmarkings and brilliant green color after it has passed into the stomach.\r\n\r\nThis large rotifer is plainly visible to the naked eye, and you will\r\nfind it in both shallow and deep ponds, wherever water plants grow,\r\nduring the months of July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--ON THE BEACH.\r\n\r\nMany of our young people spend the month of August at the seaside, and\r\nif those who wish to learn something of the curious microscopic animals\r\nwill stroll along the beach when the tide has receded, until they come\r\nto rocky places and little pools filled with salt water and various\r\nmarine plants, they will find a form of animal life quite different from\r\nthat in fresh water ponds. These little pools along the rocky coast are\r\nthe homes of countless numbers of zoophytes--animals which have a\r\nstronger resemblance to plants and flowers than any we have found in\r\nfresh water.\r\n\r\nLook for specimens for microscopic work on the surface of the rocks, on\r\ndead sea shells, and on the sea-weeds. On the sea-weeds you will often\r\nfind a white filmy network which to the unassisted eye looks like simple\r\nwhite threads running and spreading in every direction, and at every\r\nangle of the network a tiny stem shoots up, branching out like a tree\r\nand making a miniature forest.\r\n\r\nNow if you apply a low power of the microscope, you will find the little\r\nforest is made up of a strange animal called _Laomeda geniculata_.\r\n(_Fig. 1._) Each branch of this compound animal terminates and expands\r\ninto a lovely vase and is the home of a polype. The polype is not a\r\nseparate individual any more than the end of a growing branch is\r\nseparate from the tree on which it grows.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LAOMEDA.]\r\n\r\nWhen the creature is hungry he sends out from the margin of the vase\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty tentacles, ranged around the rim like the petals\r\nof a flower. _Figure 1_ shows one of these expanded polypes as seen\r\nthrough the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe tentacles or feelers are fishing rods to bring game to the fleshy\r\nmouth which is protruded from the centre of the vase. A great many such\r\nmouths surrounded with their tentacles are necessary to feed this\r\nsingular compound creature.\r\n\r\nAll that I can tell you of these microscopic animals will be nothing\r\ncompared to a study of them with your own eyes, so I will only give you\r\nhints of what you may expect, thereby hoping to create sufficient\r\ninterest to induce you to stroll to out-of-the-way places, where you may\r\nfind many of Nature's marvellous works. We want more field workers in\r\nevery department of Natural History, and especially in microscopy where\r\nunexplored fields are awaiting you.\r\n\r\nWhen the tide has receded, various objects of interest will meet your\r\neye at every step. Look at that old dead sea shell covered with a rough,\r\nshaggy nap. Ah, as we approach, the shell is moving off! What can it\r\nmean? Why, it means that a hermit crab has set up housekeeping in the\r\nold shell, and he, no doubt, thinks us suspicious characters and wants\r\nnone of our company. But we are after microscopic objects now, and this\r\nhermit, interesting as he is, is not to claim our attention to-day. The\r\nrough coat on the outside of the shell is of more interest.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of a pocket lens you will find it another zoophyte. You\r\ncan see the polypes, as thick as they can well stand, rising erect and\r\nstraight from the shaggy coat like a miniature field of wheat. With a\r\nhigher power you will see that each mouth is surrounded with tentacles\r\nlike those of _Laomeda_, but yet it is quite a different looking\r\ncreature. If we touch one of these polypes ever so lightly, the great\r\narmy immediately close their tentacles, for the same life pervades the\r\nentire colony, and those on the extreme outer edge feel the contact as\r\nquickly as the one we touched.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LARES.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most comical and amusing creatures of all the zoophyte tribe,\r\nis figured and described by Mr. Gosse under the name of _Lar\r\nSabellarum_. He was the first observer of this curious creature; he\r\nfound it inhabiting the outer edge of the tube of a worm--the Sabella.\r\nSo when you are looking for microscopic objects do not overlook any tube\r\nthat you may see standing above the surface of sand and mud, as it may\r\nbe surrounded by this singular zoophyte. The tubes usually extend an\r\ninch or two above the surface, and about as far below. I have found the\r\ntubes surrounded with the creatures, but not in as good condition for\r\ninvestigation as those Mr. Gosse mentions. Mine were too thick and\r\ncrowded to distinguish clearly. But as Mr. Gosse describes them, they\r\nhave a most close resemblance to the human figure as they stand erect\r\naround the mouth of the tube of Sabella.\r\n\r\nA loose network surrounds the top of the tube and the strange forms\r\nspring from the angles of the meshes. The creatures are furnished with\r\nheads, and immediately below the head are two arms. (_Fig. 2._) The head\r\nmoves to and fro on the neck, while the arms are tossed wildly about as\r\nif gesticulating in the most earnest manner. Or, as in the wild and\r\ndisorderly dances of savages the body sways back and forth while the\r\narms are thrown upward and downward in a frantic way.\r\n\r\nOne summer I found a colony standing so thickly together that they did\r\nnot show off to very good advantage. Apparently they were like a packed\r\narmy of Liliputians, striking out with their arms and struggling with\r\none another. But when I came to observe them more carefully, I found\r\nthey were not interfering with one another at all, but each was intent\r\non his own business of obtaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HAND OF BARNACLE.]\r\n\r\nThe Sabella which inhabits the tube, is of itself a most attractive\r\nobject. Most elegant fringed filaments proceed from the head, and wave\r\nback and forth like a fan, and near the ends of these delicate slender\r\nfilaments are little black balls, supposed to be eyes. If they are eyes,\r\nthe Sabella has no lack of vision, and this may account for his seeming\r\nwatchfulness. He is always on the alert and drops down into his house at\r\nany approach. Only with the utmost caution will you have an opportunity\r\nto leisurely look at his rare beauty.\r\n\r\nWhen for the first time I saw this elegant, beautiful creature rising\r\nout of the tube, and waving its fringed fan-like filaments, I did not\r\nwonder at Mr. Gosse's enthusiasm. Neither was I surprised that he should\r\nbe reminded of the old Roman mythology and call the zoophytes which\r\nsurround the tube, \"Lares,\" for the rare beauty of Sabella would suggest\r\nthe protection of guardian spirits. He says:\r\n\r\n\"These curious creatures have afforded much entertainment, not only to\r\nmyself, but to those scientific friends to whom I have had opportunities\r\nof exhibiting them. When I see them surrounding the mansion of the\r\nSabella, gazing, as it were, after him as he retreats into his castle,\r\nflinging their wild arms over its entrance, and keeping watch with\r\nuntiring vigilance until he reappears, it seems to require no very vivid\r\nfancy to imagine them so many guardian demons; and the Lares of the old\r\nRoman mythology occurring to memory, I described the form under the\r\nscientific appellation of _Lar Sabellarum_. You may, however, if it\r\npleases you better, call them 'witches dancing round the charmed pot.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen the tide is out you will frequently notice barnacles adhering to\r\nthe rocks, or to the timbers used in the construction of wharves. Pray\r\nstop and examine them critically and see what admirable fishers they\r\nare. Their fishing-nets are composed of several long, flexible, jointed\r\nfingers, thickly beset with sensitive hairs. When the fisher wants a\r\nmeal he thrusts his long hand (_Fig. 3_) out the door of his stone\r\nhouse; the sensitive fingers quickly tell when they come in contact with\r\nanything good to eat, and they curl over and grasp it and convey it to\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\nThese barnacles are wonderful creatures and well worthy your continuous\r\nstudy. They pass through several stages. When young they are a gay\r\nrolicking set, swimming freely in the water; but as maturity approaches\r\nthey settle down in stone houses, never more to rove about, and set up\r\nfishing for a living.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--RHIZOPODS.\r\n\r\nRhizopods are the lowest creatures in the animal kingdom. Some of them\r\nare apparently nothing more than animated protoplasm. Protoplasm\r\npertains to the first formation of living bodies, whether vegetable or\r\nanimal, and it appears to be only a viscid, glutinous, unformed mass of\r\njelly-like substance, yet these rhizopods seem endowed with something\r\nmore than simple life.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1. AMOEBA PRINCEPS, IN DIFFERENT FORMS.]\r\n\r\nLet us take the lowest of these lowly creatures, the _amoeba_, or\r\nproteus, which we may find during the summer in almost every fresh water\r\npond. I cannot describe it, for, like its namesake, it is constantly\r\nchanging its form, slipping away from us, as it were, right before our\r\neyes, and assuming a new shape. As Proteus of old could assume any form,\r\neither plant or animal as he pleased, so our _amoeba_ can assume\r\nvarious forms at pleasure.\r\n\r\nYou will remember that Homer introduces Proteus in the fourth book of\r\nthe _Odyssey_. He makes him the servant of Neptune, and says his office\r\nwas to take care of the seals or sea-calves. And who knows but his\r\nnamesake may have some such office among the curious beings of the\r\nmicroscopic world which is peopled with as many strange creatures as\r\nthose we read of in ancient mythology?\r\n\r\nWe frequently see our proteus adhering to a leaf of some water plant\r\nwhen it looks like a little ball of jelly; and while we are looking at\r\nit, it pushes out an arm here, and now another there, and still another,\r\nas if feeling for something. (_Fig. 1, Amoeba princeps._) Not finding\r\nanything to its taste, it moves or crawls along with its temporary arms\r\nextended--all the while changing them, throwing one out on this side,\r\nthen on that, then contracting and pushing out in another place. It\r\nseems to be actively in search of something. At last it has reached a\r\nmoving diatom with one of its long arms, which it immediately wraps\r\naround it, and now the other arms are contracted and the creature\r\nactually folds itself around its dinner! He turns himself outside in,\r\nand makes a temporary stomach, and proceeds to digest the soft parts of\r\nthe diatom. After he has extracted all the nourishing part, he squeezes\r\nor pushes out the clear, transparent shell, and starts in search for\r\nsomething more.\r\n\r\nIt is not known to a certainty how the _amoebae_ are produced, but this\r\nmuch is known: If a portion of the body is detached from the rest, it\r\ndoes not die, but becomes an independent _amoeba_. If a portion of one\r\nof the arms becomes separated from the main body, it does not seem to\r\nincommode the creature in the least, and the small part soon begins to\r\nextend tiny arms and behave in every way like its parent. And this may\r\nbe the only way in which the children of Proteus are made--veritable\r\nchildren of his own flesh.\r\n\r\nHow strange it seems that a jelly-like mass of substance without form or\r\norganization should be endowed with life and sufficient sense to go in\r\nsearch of food and have the power of selection.\r\n\r\nLife manifested in the lowest animal or plant is just as wonderful and\r\nhard to understand as that which pervades the higher animals.\r\n\r\nSome of the species of the fresh water _amoeba_ live in shells of\r\nvarious forms and patterns. One which we often see has a little house\r\nmade of tiny particles of sand and minute bits of shell soldered\r\ntogether with a kind of cement which hardens in water; these are vase or\r\npitcher-shaped and always look rough on the outside.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2. TESTACEOUS FORMS OF AMOEBAN RHIZOPODS.]\r\n\r\nWe may always know the different species by the forms and patterns of\r\nthe shells in which they live. Some have very regular shells and\r\nprettily marked. These are usually rounded or arched on one side and\r\nflat on the other.\r\n\r\nWhen you are looking for various microscopic objects in pond water you\r\nwill often see these tiny shells among the sediment on your slides, and\r\nif you will patiently wait a few moments you will soon see delicate,\r\ntransparent arms slowly pushing out on every side like cautious feelers.\r\n(_Figure 2, Amoeba in Shell._--_Carpenter_, p. 445.)\r\n\r\nBut the most beautiful forms, and by far the greatest variety of these\r\nmicroscopic shells are found in the ocean and in marine deposits. If we\r\nlook at the seaweeds which grow on the rocks we may see many white\r\nspecks adhering to every part of the plants. With a lens we find the\r\nminute specks are spiral shells of many species belonging to the class\r\n_Foraminifera_, and very closely allied to the _amoeba_. The shells\r\nare of most elegant form and pattern. The large sea-shells which we so\r\nmuch admire are not half so lovely in form or color as these seen\r\nthrough a microscope. Some of the living animals and the castles in\r\nwhich they dwell are crimson in color, others a delicate pink.\r\n\r\nLet us take one of these living shells while it clings to the sea-weed\r\nand carefully cut off the smallest portion of the plant to which it\r\nadheres, so as to disturb the occupant as little as possible; and now\r\nplace it in the live box with some of the salt water and we shall soon\r\nhave a most beautiful sight.\r\n\r\nSee, the creature is throwing out delicate, transparent threads or\r\nfilaments in every direction, like fine-spun glass. How charming it\r\nlooks with the beautiful shell in the centre, surrounded by this moving,\r\nfilmy halo, and how slowly and cautiously the filaments are extended! He\r\nis not a heedless, reckless creature, rushing into needless danger, but\r\na quiet, timid citizen. Although he was such a long time throwing out\r\nhis misty arms, when he scents danger he withdraws them as quick as a\r\nflash. The least jar of the live-box, or a little wriggling larva--much\r\ntoo large for him to manage, however--are sufficient to make him take in\r\nall of his lines; but when quiet is restored, they are again stretched\r\nout. And for what purpose are these slender filaments extended? Ah, an\r\ninnocent animalcule has become entangled among the shimmering, filmy\r\nthreads, and now the threads coalesce, run together like the arms of\r\n_amoeba_, and disappear, and the animalcule is drawn within the walls\r\nof the beautiful castle, and we are left to conjecture the fate of the\r\nlittle victim. _Figure 3, Rotalia Ornata_--which shows its delicate\r\nfilaments extended.\r\n\r\nThese tiny creatures have been so numerous way back in the early ages of\r\nthe world, that entire strata of rocks, several feet in thickness, in\r\nvarious parts of the world, are made up of their skeletons. The city of\r\nRichmond, Virginia, is built over rocks, composed largely of the minute\r\nfossils of _Diatomaceae_ intermingled with the _Foraminifera_ and others.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3. ROTALIA ORNATA.]\r\n\r\nA single prepared slide of these fossils will afford entertainment for\r\nan entire evening, so great is the diversity of form and so many\r\nhundreds on one slide. The Bahama Islands furnish the finest specimens\r\nof these fossils. The slides can be procured of any large dealer in\r\noptical instruments, or, what is still better, the young microscopist\r\ncan soon learn to prepare them for himself, as ample directions are\r\ngiven in the books on the microscope.\r\n\r\nIn bidding my young readers adieu I shall not lose entire thought of\r\nthem, but often when I am engaged in looking through the microscope, I\r\nshall think and ask myself, \"Are they, too, absorbed in this pleasant\r\nwork, and how many will become true workers and original investigators\r\nin this great field?\" We shall all know in due time, for no earnest\r\nworker in any branch of science can long remain unknown. He will be\r\nfound out sooner or later. A devoted student in microscopy will become\r\nso happy over the marvellous creatures and their curious ways that he\r\ncannot keep his pleasure to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nA HOME-MADE MICROSCOPE, AND HOW TO USE IT\r\n\r\nBY FREDERICK LEROY SARGENT\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--HOW TO SEE A DANDELION.\r\n\r\nA simple microscope, some mounted needles, a sharp knife and a pair of\r\nsmall forceps, are the only things needed to begin with.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of simple microscopes sold, some of which are of\r\nmoderate price and answer every purpose; but if one has a little\r\nmechanical skill the cheapest way is to buy a magnifier and make the\r\nrest of the microscope one's self. What is known as the \"bellows\r\npattern,\" with three lenses, is one of the best of the cheaper forms of\r\nmagnifiers, and is an admirable little instrument.\r\n\r\n_Fig. 1_ shows a home-made microscope ready for use. It will be seen\r\nthat the main part consists of a wooden box having a hole in the top and\r\nopen in front. To the back is attached a cork by means of a piece of\r\nthin metal as shown in _fig. 2_. Through this cord slides a rod on which\r\nslides another cork. A piece of brass wire has one end wound round the\r\nupper cork while the other end projects as an arm at right angles to the\r\nrod, and this projecting end sharpened and upturned, passes through\r\nholes drilled in the handle of the magnifier, and thus supports it. The\r\nlenses are focused, _i. e._ brought to the right distance from the\r\nobject viewed, by sliding the cork up and down on the rod.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe object rests on a piece of glass laid over the hole in the top of\r\nthe box. A piece of wood covered with white paper and placed below the\r\nobject at an angle of about forty-five degrees answers for a reflector\r\nto illuminate those objects through which the light can pass. The pure\r\nwhite surface is better for the purpose than a mirror.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe most delicate part of the construction is making the holes in the\r\ncorks for the rod to slide through. This may be done perfectly, however,\r\nby making the holes with a rat-tail file, trying the rod now and then\r\nuntil it moves just right. The best thing for the rod is a piece of\r\nbrass wire one quarter of an inch thick; a lead pencil however is a good\r\nsubstitute. Before bending the end of the brass wire arm it is well to\r\nheat it red-hot at the point of bending, to take out the temper: as\r\notherwise it may break. The holes in the handle of the magnifier should\r\nbe drilled as near the front as possible and so arranged that when the\r\nmagnifier is in position the smallest lens will be near the object.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe mounted needles are shown in _fig. 3_. One pair of each kind will be\r\nenough to start with. To make one, take a fine needle, break off about a\r\nthird, so it will not be too long and springy; then with a pair of\r\npincers force it into the handle point first, withdraw it and finally\r\nforce it in again with the point out. It may be easily bent with the\r\npincers by first heating it to redness in a flame. When bent, heat it\r\nred once more and plunge quickly into water to re-temper it. Rubbing on\r\nan oil stone may be necessary to remove roughness. Should the handles\r\nshow any tendency to split, it would be well to wrap the end tightly\r\nwith waxed thread.\r\n\r\nThe forceps (_fig. 4_) may be purchased either of brass or steel at no\r\ngreat expense. Although not necessary it is more convenient to have them\r\ncurved than straight.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIf the reader will carefully follow the directions given below and\r\nendeavor to see for himself all the parts spoken of, he will probably\r\nhave very little difficulty afterward in the use of the instruments just\r\ndescribed; and the enjoyment he will have when he has learned how to\r\nexamine little things, will amply repay for careful and persistent\r\nefforts at the start. Get a Dandelion in full bloom and also one that\r\nhas gone to seed.\r\n\r\nHave the microscope and the other instruments ready for use. The best\r\nplace to work is on a table in front of a window where there is plenty\r\nof light, but not the direct rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nNow cut the blossom in halves from the stem up. It will be seen that the\r\nstem is hollow and ends above in a cushion-like expansion. From the\r\nupper surface of this grow a number of little flowers, while from the\r\nsides there sprang two rows of little green organs that enclose the\r\nflower cluster like a cup. Remove one of the flowers with the forceps\r\nand place it in a drop of water on the glass stage of the microscope.\r\nExamine with one and one half inch power.[A]\r\n\r\nBe careful to get just the focus. You are now ready to see the general\r\nform of the flower. At the base is a little body with roughened sides\r\nand slightly narrowed above (the ovary). Springing from the top of the\r\novary are a number of fine bristles (the pappus). Inside the bristles is\r\na yellow portion, tubular below and flat above (the corolla).\r\nProjecting from the tube of the corolla is a little yellow rod (the top\r\nof the stamens joined together); and coming from among the stamens are\r\ntwo slender recurved organs (the stigmas).\r\n\r\nNow take a mounted needle in each hand and holding one needle on the\r\nflat part of the corolla split open the tubular part with the other. By\r\nkeeping the lower part spread open with the needles, you will see that a\r\nnumber of delicate yellow threads grow from the sides of the corolla and\r\nare connected with the yellow stamen rod. These threads are another part\r\nof the stamens. In the middle of the flower is a single thread-like\r\norgan (the style) which comes from the top of the ovary and passing\r\nthrough the stamens projects beyond them, divided into two stigmas.\r\n\r\nMost of my readers have probably studied enough botany to know the names\r\nof the different parts of a flower, but very likely many of them do not\r\nrecognize the parts of the Dandelion flower as looking anything like the\r\nparts of the flower with which they are familiar.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, therefore let us take a Morning-Glory\r\nflower--which you all know and can easily obtain, or at least some\r\nflower like it--and let us see that the parts of the two correspond.\r\n\r\nCommencing in the centre we find in both a pistil, consisting of an\r\novary at the base and a stigma at the top and a style between. In the\r\nDandelion the stigma is split in halves, while in the morning-glory it\r\nis not split but has three little knobs. Around the pistil come the\r\nstamens in each case. Each stamen is composed of two parts: a slender\r\nstem (the filament) and a little sac at the end (the anther) which is\r\nfilled with pollen dust. In both cases the filaments grow out of the\r\nsides of the corolla. But while in the Morning-Glory the anthers are\r\nentirely free from one another, in the Dandelion they are joined\r\ntogether by their sides and form a tube around the style. The corolla in\r\nboth cases is all of one piece, but in the Dandelion it is as if the\r\nupper part of the corolla were split open one side and then made flat.\r\nInstead of a green calyx as in the Morning-Glory, the Dandelion has a\r\nnumber of delicate white bristles. And, finally, in the Morning-Glory\r\nboth the calyx and corolla grow out from below the ovary, while in the\r\nDandelion its calyx of bristles and its corolla issue from above the\r\novary. So after all, you will see that corresponding organs are in both,\r\nand the difference between the two flowers is not so great as one might\r\nthink at first.\r\n\r\nLet the different parts of the Dandelion be examined now more minutely.\r\nFirst take some of the bristles and examine them with one quarter inch\r\npower. They are not perfectly smooth, but are more or less saw-like on\r\nthe edge. With the same power look at other parts of the flower; notice\r\nthe hairiness of the stigmas, the pollen grains coming out of the\r\nanthers (some grains may be found on the stigmas) also the roughness of\r\nthe ovary and the delicate ribs or veins in the corolla. Examine one of\r\nthe seed-like fruits with one and one half inch power. It is a ripened\r\novary. Compare the fruit with the ovary of a flower. The nutlet has\r\nbecome hard, rougher and more strongly ribbed. The narrowed upper part\r\nof the ovary has become much elongated and the pappus is spread out like\r\nan inverted umbrella.\r\n\r\nExamine some bristles with one quarter inch power. They show the\r\nsaw-like edges much more developed than in the younger bristles of the\r\nflower. We see throughout a beautiful adaptation of every part for\r\nfitting the little parachute to be carried long distances by the wind\r\nand finally to catch on some suitable place in which to sprout.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--HOW TO SEE A BUMBLE BEE.\r\n\r\nYou will first need to catch your Bumble Bee. A little chloroform poured\r\non one will kill it instantly. Make a general examination at the outset\r\nof the insect. The outside of the body is horny and covered thickly with\r\nhairs. On the upper side the hairs are much more numerous than on the\r\nunder side. The whole body is divided into three regions: the head,\r\nbearing the feelers and mouth-parts; a middle part (thorax) bearing the\r\nfour wings and six legs; and a hind part (abdomen) armed with the sting.\r\n\r\nRemove the head and examine with one and one half inch power. At the\r\nsides are two prominent oval bodies (compound eyes) which seem to be\r\ncrossed by five lines; near the top of the head, between the compound\r\neyes, are three little shiny bead-like organs (simple eyes); starting\r\nfrom about the middle of the face are the two feelers (antennae) and at\r\nthe lower part of the head are the mouth-parts. The sides, top and front\r\nof the head are all covered with hair.\r\n\r\nExamine one of the compound eyes with one fourth inch power. The surface\r\nis made up of innumerable little facets, something like a cut diamond.\r\n\r\nCut off a piece of one of the compound eyes, remove some of the black\r\npigment on the back and examine the piece in a drop of water. Each facet\r\nis a tiny hexagon. Some care is necessary to see them well.\r\n\r\nRemove an antenna and examine it with three fourths inch power. It is\r\nthickly covered with minute hairs which give it a velvety appearance.\r\nCount the joints. At the base is the longest joint; at the lower end of\r\nwhich is a little knob that fits into a socket in the head. The next\r\njoint is quite small while those beyond are much alike.\r\n\r\nScrape the hairs from the face and examine the horny shell with three\r\nfourths inch power. The surface is full of little pits. In the upper\r\npart of the face there is a groove, in the middle of which is one of\r\nthe simple eyes. Just below the antennae sockets is a groove which\r\nextends crosswise a short distance on either side and then bends\r\ndownwards to the mouth. The portion of the face bounded by this groove\r\nis called the clypeus. At its lower part is hinged a little oblong piece\r\n(labium) which may be moved up and down with a needle.\r\n\r\nMelt a piece of sealing wax on the centre of a slip of glass (taking\r\ncare not to break the glass by too sudden heating) and before the wax\r\nhardens press the head into it face downwards.\r\n\r\nExamine with one inch power. The hole near the top of the head shows the\r\nposition of the neck. The portion of the head around this hole is\r\ndestitute of hairs and is hollowed in, to make room for the rounded\r\nfront part of the thorax. Below this one there is another cavity which\r\ncontains a portion of the mouth parts when they are retracted. At each\r\nside of the mouth in front of the base of the sucking organs, are the\r\ntwo jaws (mandibles) each with a little tuft of hair on the outer side.\r\nThe jaws move freely to and from each other, sideways instead of up and\r\ndown as do the jaws of the higher animals. The sucking apparatus\r\nconsists of five pieces viz: two outermost pieces each tapering to a\r\nfine point, two, each of which ends in three little joints and one in\r\nthe centre which projects beyond the others. It may be necessary to\r\nspread these out with the needle, to see them well.\r\n\r\nSeparate the thorax from the rest of the body. Scrape off the hairs on\r\nthe back. Two principal grooves extend across the back, one near the\r\nfront and one near the hind margin. The thorax is composed of three\r\ndivisions and these grooves show where they are joined together. The\r\nhind division bears the hind wings and the hind pair of legs; the middle\r\ndivision, much the largest division of the three, bears the fore wings\r\nand the middle pair of legs; and the foremost division is quite small\r\nand bears only the front pair of legs.\r\n\r\nRemove the wings of one side and examine in a drop of water with one and\r\none half inch power. The wings consist of a shining transparent membrane\r\nstrengthened by numerous horny veins running through it. Examine with\r\none half inch power. The membrane is seen to be covered with minute\r\nhairs and little dots. On the front edge of the hind wing a short\r\ndistance from the outer end is a row of hooks. At a corresponding place\r\non the hind edge of the fore wing there is a thickening or ridge. When\r\nflying, the hooks catch onto the ridge and thus the wings are held\r\ntogether and act as one large wing.\r\n\r\nExamine this grappling apparatus with one fourth inch power and with the\r\nneedles hook the wings together and pull them apart. If you look through\r\nthe magnifier while you do this you will get a good idea of the form of\r\nthe ridge and of how the hooks catch onto it. Remove one of the\r\nforelegs, being sure that none remains attached to the body. Examine\r\nwith one and one half inch power. The extremity is armed with two claws;\r\nthen come four short joints followed by one about as long as the others\r\ntogether. All these make up the foot. The next joint above is the shank,\r\nthen comes the thigh and then quite a small joint, the lower hip, and\r\nlastly attached to the body is the upper hip.\r\n\r\nRemove the last five joints of the foot (the claw part, and the other\r\nfour joints) examine with one third inch power. The claws have each a\r\nbranch projecting from the inner edge. Between the claws is a little\r\nvelvety pad. Each of the small joints is covered with short closely\r\nappressed hairs and from the lower end of each joint project several\r\nspines. Now examine the remaining long joint of the foot attached to the\r\nshank. At the upper end of the inner side is a deep semicircular notch,\r\nthe upper portion of which is light colored. Beside the notch is a\r\npeculiarly shaped movable spine which projects from the lower end of the\r\nshank. This queer arrangement is what the bee uses to clean his feelers.\r\nThe reader has probably seen the operation performed by a bee or a wasp.\r\nThe leg is thrown over the feeler, the latter is grasped at that\r\nparticular bend of the leg where the cleansing apparatus is situated and\r\nthen drawn through from base to tip; and this is repeated several times\r\nwith each feeler.\r\n\r\nExamine with one and one half inch power a leg from each of the other\r\npairs and compare the corresponding parts. They differ chiefly in size\r\nand in the absence of the cleansing apparatus. You cannot fail to\r\nadmire the many beautiful forms of the different portions. On the outer\r\nside of the hind shank is a smooth flattish surface destitute of hairs,\r\nexcepting a fringe of long ones at the margin. At this place may\r\nsometimes be found a sticky mass of pollen intended for bee-bread.\r\nExamine the abdomen with one and one half inch power. It is composed of\r\nseveral wings. If some of the hairs are scraped off this will be shown\r\nmore clearly. From the hind extremity projects the sting.\r\n\r\nWe have far from exhausted all the beautiful and interesting points in\r\nthe make-up of a Bumble Bee, not even those that may be seen with the\r\nlimited powers of a simple microscope; but probably enough has been said\r\nto show the reader that such things are well worthy of study and it is\r\nhoped that enough directions have been given to render future use of the\r\ninstruments comparatively free from difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--SOME LITTLE THINGS TO SEE.\r\n\r\nThere is no end to the beautiful and wonderful things one can see with\r\nthe simple microscope. Only a few of the more attractive and easily\r\nobtained of these are now to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are ever so many pretty flowers to look at. The\r\nasterworts, that is, such flowers as the daisy, aster, golden rod,\r\ndandelion and thistle, are particularly full of beauty. The blossoms are\r\nall made up of a number of little flowers as in the dandelion; but the\r\nshapes and colors and so forth, of the different kinds are exceedingly\r\nvarious. Some, such as the asters and daisies, have two kinds of flowers\r\nin the same blossom--flowers with strap-shaped corollas (like the\r\ndandelion's) are arranged along the margin of the blossom, while in the\r\ncentre are little flowers with star-shaped corollas presenting a much\r\ndifferent appearance. Flowers of many of the Parsley Family, for\r\nexample wild carrot, wild parsnip and caraway, are quite odd. Very\r\npretty flowers are found among the grasses, sedges and common weeds. The\r\ndifferent trees as they bloom in spring--the maples, elms, willows,\r\npoplars, sassafras and hosts of others--all have flowers that are\r\nperfectly lovely. Most of these flowers need to be picked to pieces\r\nunder the magnifier to show up their full beauty. The parts of flowers,\r\nboth small and large ones, deserve attention. Frequently one meets with\r\nremarkable forms.\r\n\r\nSeeds are highly interesting. They are often handsomely marked with\r\nseries of pits or projections, grooves or ridges. One meets with many\r\ncurious appendages by means of which the seeds are carried off and sown\r\nat a distance from the plant. Some, like the dandelion, have a parachute\r\nattachment; others have wings to catch the wind, and others still are\r\ncovered with hooked spines whereby they become attached to the fur of\r\nanimals, there to remain until brushed off onto the ground.\r\n\r\nLeaves and stems sometimes have on them beautiful hairs and oil-glands.\r\nThe wooly covering of common mullein, for example, is made up of\r\ninnumerable slender-branched hairs. These show best when a piece of the\r\nleaf broken off is looked at edgewise.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the fruit-dots on the backs of the different kinds of\r\nferns you will be surprised to find how pretty they are and of how many\r\ndifferent shapes. Sometimes the fruit is not borne on the back of the\r\nleaf but forms little clusters by themselves, which are sometimes at the\r\nend of the fern, sometimes in the middle, sometimes on a separate stalk.\r\n\r\nMosses, lichens and sea-weeds are well worth looking at.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer an exquisite little fungus called \"Cluster cups\" may\r\nbe found on the underside of barberry leaves. Hawthorn and other plants\r\nhave handsome fungi on them later in the season.\r\n\r\nBy observing closely while out in the fields or woods, one sees hovering\r\nabout in swarms, myriads of tiny insects. Under the lens some of them\r\nare very odd, others very beautiful. The easiest way to catch these\r\nlittle midgets, is to wet the palm of the hand and then sweep it among\r\nthem, or in the same way use a piece of sticky paper.\r\n\r\nThe study of the different parts of insects is one of the most\r\nfascinating of the many uses of the Simple microscope. Although all\r\ninsects are made up on the same general plan and corresponding organs\r\noccur in most of them, there is an endless variety in the forms under\r\nwhich we see the different organs and the uses to which they are put.\r\n\r\nTake for example the antennae. In the grasshopper it is long and\r\nthreadlike; in the butterflies always ending in a knob; in moths always\r\ntapering to a point, although sometimes threadlike and sometimes much\r\nbranched, forming a beautiful plume; in the beetles, sometimes fan-like,\r\nsometimes like a comb; and in other insects assuming still other forms.\r\nInsects' eyes are often colored beautifully. A horse-fly's eyes are\r\nstriped. Butterflies' eyes have usually a soft liquid coloring, and\r\nmoths' eyes in the dark shine like little fiery beads.\r\n\r\nThe mouths of insects, such as beetles, grasshoppers and dragon flies,\r\nhave strong jaws for biting; flies, bugs, moths and butterflies, have\r\nthe mouth-parts transformed into sucking organs, while bees, wasps and\r\nthe like have both sucking organs for honey, and biting organs for\r\nleaf-cutting, wood-tearing etc. as we saw was the case in the Bumble\r\nBee.\r\n\r\nButterflies' wings and moths' wings are covered with little scales of a\r\nvariety of shapes. These should be examined attached to the wing to show\r\ntheir arrangement which is like that of shingles on a roof; but to show\r\ntheir form they should be looked at when brushed from the wing onto a\r\npiece of glass. Many other peculiarities may be noticed in the wings of\r\nother kinds of insects.\r\n\r\nLegs, the same as the other organs, have various forms, markings and\r\nappendages, and so it is with the abdomen and its stings or its\r\negg-laying apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe hairs of \"Wooly Bears\" and caterpillars of that kind are peculiarly\r\nbranched.\r\n\r\nThe four hind pairs of feet in caterpillars are armed each with a row\r\nof little hooks which are used in walking to get a firm hold. The larger\r\ncaterpillars show the hooks best.\r\n\r\nSometimes you will find pretty insect eggs on the underside of leaves or\r\non stems, and also little silken cocoons in similar places. If you are\r\nnear a pond-hole, or an old hogshead that collects rain water, you can\r\nfind a good many little animals, some of them very frisky--young\r\nmosquitoes or \"polywogs,\" water-fleas, cyclops, little worms, young\r\ndragon-flies and lots of others. When you go to collect them take a\r\nsmall wide-mouth bottle and, having found a place where there is what\r\nyou want, lower your bottle, mouth down, in the midst of them and when\r\nit is well under water turn the mouth upwards. A good many of the\r\nanimals will run in with the water. If the first time you do not get\r\nwhat you want, the second time you may. When you want to examine them at\r\nhome you can fish them out with a glass tube and put them in a watch\r\ncrystal or on the glass stage of the microscope. In using the tube take\r\nit between the thumb and middle and third fingers, and close the top\r\nwith your first finger; then put the lower end of the tube in the water\r\nclose to the thing you want to catch; now lift your first finger quickly\r\nand the water will run in the lower end of the tube carrying with it\r\nyour little squirmer, unless he has been too quick for you. Close the\r\ntop of your tube again and the water will not run out when you remove\r\nthe tube, until you lift your finger. Sometimes it takes a good deal of\r\npatience and skill to catch the more agile of the little water animals.\r\nGlass tubes are sold in drug stores for five or ten cents.\r\n\r\nIf you begin by examining the objects already spoken of, you will while\r\nlooking for these be continually discovering for yourselves new objects\r\npossessing new beauties and will soon see that not half the interesting\r\nthings you can find have been ever hinted at.\r\n\r\nThe way to find out about all these things is to go out into the fields\r\nand woods, and form the habit of observing closely what is around you.\r\nCarry your magnifier along and look at this flower, that fern, this\r\ninsect, that moss, with different powers of the magnifier; and when you\r\ncome across any objects worthy of a more careful examination carry them\r\nhome and examine them systematically with Simple microscope, needles,\r\nknife, and so forth. Insects may be kept well in alcohol until winter,\r\nand then careful studies may be made of them.\r\n\r\nWhen using the magnifier in the field, hold it in such a way that the\r\nsmallest lens will be nearest the object when the lenses are combined\r\nand be careful not to shade the object with the hand or the hat brim.\r\nJust enough light should fall on the object to make its examination\r\ncomfortable for the eyes. If you rest the hand holding the magnifier on\r\nthe hand that holds the object, both lens and object can be held much\r\nsteadier. When commencing to examine an object it is best to have the\r\nthree lenses spread apart, for in this way you can use first the lowest\r\npower then those higher and finally, if you wish to, the three lenses\r\ncombined. The dissecting forceps are very handy to have in the field,\r\nboth for picking up anything too small for the fingers and for holding\r\nan object to be examined.\r\n\r\nA collection of some of these little things preserved and ready for\r\nexamination adds greatly to the pleasures of studying them. Of course\r\nall the different kinds of objects cannot be preserved so as to show\r\ntheir full beauty, but many can be and the following directions will\r\ntell how to make a very good collection:\r\n\r\nSeeds, fern-fruit, insects and other opaque objects like these may be\r\nmounted on pasteboard slides. One of these slides consists simply of a\r\nstout piece of pasteboard, having a hole cut in the centre and a piece\r\nof thick paper or cardboard glued on the under side. The object is\r\nattached to the cardboard at the bottom of the hole.\r\n\r\nIt is best to make a number of these slides at a time. Having procured\r\nsome quite thick pasteboard, from old paper boxes, rule lines on the\r\nsurface dividing it up into spaces three inches long by one inch wide.\r\nIn the centre of each space cut out a hole about half an inch in\r\ndiameter. A sharp knife will make a neat square hole or a good round one\r\nmay be made with a gun-wad punch. This done, the spaces may be cut apart\r\nwith a sharp knife and ruler, along the lines already drawn. Pieces of\r\ncardboard for the backs should be cut a trifle larger than the\r\npasteboard portion of the slide; after they are glued onto the latter\r\nthey may be trimmed down neatly with a pair of scissors. Glue or\r\nmucilage containing glycerine (in the proportion of one or two\r\nteaspoonfuls to an ordinary bottle of mucilage) is the best thing to use\r\nfor sticking on the backs. While the slides are drying they should be\r\neither under a weight or in a clamp screwed up tightly, so as to prevent\r\ntheir twisting out of shape. The mucilage may be prevented from being\r\nsqueezed in round the edges of the hole, by taking care when putting it\r\non not to have it come too near the hole. One or two coats of India Ink\r\nmay be painted on the middle of some of the pieces of cardboard, either\r\nbefore or after they are put onto the slides; and thus a black\r\nbackground may be obtained for the lighter-colored opaque objects. Many\r\nof the objects will however show best on a white background.\r\n\r\nWhen you have the slides all made, nothing more is needed to mount an\r\nobject, than simply to attach it to the bottom of the hole with a\r\nlittle mucilage and glycerine, or something of that sort, and finally to\r\nwrite the name of the object on the front part of the slide, and on the\r\nback any desirable notes. A good way to mount such objects as fine seeds\r\nis to put them in the hole loosely and then cover them with a piece of\r\nmica such as will be spoken of presently.\r\n\r\nObjects which are to be examined by the light shining through them, for\r\nexample a bee's wing or a butterfly's scales, must be mounted on glass\r\nslides.\r\n\r\nA glass slide three inches by one is taken, on the centre is placed the\r\nobject; over this is laid a thin piece of clear mica three fourths of an\r\ninch square, and this is attached to the glass by pasting narrow strips\r\nof tissue paper around the edges of the cover, partly on the cover and\r\npartly on the slide. Finally the slide is covered with some pretty\r\ncolored paper and labeled.\r\n\r\nTwo pieces of paper are needed to cover each slide. One for the under\r\npart is cut about one and one half by three and one half inches, with a\r\nhole in the centre (round or square). This piece is first pasted on,\r\nthe corners being cut and the edges brought over onto the front. The\r\nupper piece, which has a hole in the centre similar to that in the lower\r\npiece, and is cut a trifle larger than the three by one inch slide, is\r\nnext pasted on so that the hole will correspond with the one below. The\r\nupper piece of paper is now trimmed down to the slide and the label\r\nattached. Window glass will answer for the slides and you can get any\r\nglazier to cut up a piece for you into the right-sized slips. Mica can\r\nbe bought at a stove store, in sheets which may be cut up into three\r\nfourths of an inch squares with a pair of scissors. The mica should be\r\nas clear as you can get it. You will find it handy to have some tissue\r\npaper all mucilaged like postage stamps and cut up in strips the right\r\nsize ready to use. The same may be said of the colored paper covers and\r\nthe labels.\r\n\r\nThe dust may be excluded from the uncovered opaque objects by keeping\r\nthe mounted slides in small groups, held together by elastic bands. This\r\nwill also serve to classify them so that all the insects will be\r\ntogether, all the seeds, and so on; and the transparent slides may also\r\nbe treated in the same way. When an elastic band wears out, it is no\r\ngreat trouble to replace it.\r\n\r\nIn working with the Simple microscope there is a fine chance to display\r\ningenuity, not only in making the instruments and mounting the objects\r\nbut in discovering new things to look at and in seeing how much can be\r\nfound out about those things which are the most common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] In these directions \"1-1/2 _in._ power\" means a lens having\r\n  a focus of 1-1/2 inches; \"1/2 _in._ power\" means a lens or combination\r\n  of lenses having a focus of 1/2 inch; and so on. All the different\r\n  powers mentioned in the directions may be obtained in the small-sized\r\n  3-lens, bellows form magnifier, either by using the lenses singly or\r\n  combined in different ways. The magnifying power of any single lens or\r\n  simple combination is easily found by dividing 10, by the focus in\r\n  inches. Thus the magnifying power of a 1/2 _in._ lens is found in this\r\n  way: 10/1/2 = 10x2/1 20. The lens magnifies therefore 20 diameters\r\n  _i. e._ makes an object appear twenty times as long and twenty times as\r\n  broad as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\nText in italics is surrounded with underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\nInconsistencies in hyphenation have been retained from the original.\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors have been corrected as follows:\r\n\r\n  Page 8: hundreth changed to hundredth\r\n  Page 11: iustrument changed to instrument\r\n  Page 15: diferent changed to different\r\n  Page 17: he changed to the\r\n  Page 20: wil changed to will\r\n  Page 44: or changed to of\r\n  Page 72: staightened changed to straightened\r\n  Page 86: DIFFRENT changed to DIFFERENT\r\n  Page 125: fouths changed to fourths",
