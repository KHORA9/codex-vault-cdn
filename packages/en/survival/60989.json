STATE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nD.A.R. State Park is located in western Vermont on State Highway 17,\r\napproximately 1 mile north of Lake Champlain (toll) Bridge (see map,\r\nFig. 1). The park, which fronts on Lake Champlain, contains undeveloped\r\nacres on the east side of the Highway. Tenting, leanto camping,\r\npicnicking and swimming are adequately provided for during the summer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThis park, more than most others, not only awakens the visitor’s\r\ncuriosity about the past history of the Earth, but satisfies it. The\r\nstory of an ancient sea and the life which existed in it can be read\r\nfrom the rocks exposed in D.A.R. State Park. You can read this story for\r\nyourselves. This Pamphlet is designed as an aid to a more complete\r\nunderstanding of the observations which you make. “Reading the rock\r\nrecord” is not difficult, but the geologist does have the advantage of\r\npossessing a certain trained scientific approach to these problems. This\r\nmethod of approach, the “tools of the trade,” will now be passed on to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGY OF THE PARK\r\n\r\nThe park beach is the ideal place to study the rocks of the park, for\r\nhere the rocks are best exposed and can be easily examined at close\r\nrange. The attitude of the rock layers can be seen on a walk down the\r\nramp. By attitude is meant their relationship to an imaginary horizontal\r\nplane, which for our purposes is the level of the lake. Are the rock\r\nlayers parallel to the surface of Lake Champlain or do they slant or dip\r\ninto it? If the layers were parallel to the surface they would not\r\n“dip.” The dip of the park strata (layers) is seen in Figure 2. Dip is\r\nexpressed in the number of degrees _down_ from the horizontal and here\r\nthe dip is toward the west and is measured to be between 8 and 11\r\ndegrees. The dip is always measured perpendicular to an imaginary\r\nhorizontal line on a rock layer called a “strike line.” The average\r\n“strike,” or compass direction of the “strike line” is 22 degrees east\r\nof _north_.[1]\r\n\r\n_Sedimentary rocks_[2] crop out on the park beach. These were originally\r\nlime mud resting on the sea bottom. Under continued pressure from the\r\noverlying sediments resulting from continued deposition and burial, the\r\nmuds were slowly compacted and cemented into the hard limestones and\r\nlimy shales which we see today. The many layers of rock were then\r\ntilted. Tilted layers tell the geologist of giant earth movements which\r\ntook place since their formation. The story of these movements will be\r\ndeveloped later in this pamphlet.\r\n\r\nAs you look at the tilted rock layers from the ramp, can you tell which\r\nlayers are the oldest, that is, those first deposited as lime muds on\r\nthe sea bottom? A basic geologic law, the Law of Superposition, states\r\nthat if a series of sedimentary layers have _not_ been overturned, the\r\noldest is on the bottom and the youngest on top. Assuming that the\r\nlayers which you are looking at have not been overturned, those on your\r\nleft (south) are the oldest and those on your right (north) the\r\nyoungest. Looking at Figure 2, taken from the ramp-bottom toward the\r\nnorth, the layers in the foreground are older than those in the\r\ndistance. Let us take a close look at the individual layers of rock and\r\ndelve deeper into the story that they have to tell.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Block diagram illustrating _dip_ and\r\n    _strike_.]\r\n\r\n  STRIKE DIRECTION\r\n  ROCK LAYER\r\n  SURFACE (PLANE) LAKE LEVEL\r\n  HORIZONTAL\r\n  DIP\r\n  ROCK LAYER\r\n\r\nSearch the top of a few layers and you will notice many shell and other\r\nanimal impressions. Do they represent animals which lived hundreds of\r\nmillions of years ago or were they washed onto these rocks from\r\npresent-day Lake Champlain? If you try to make a collection of the shell\r\nimpressions you will see that they are a part of the rock and therefore\r\nmust represent remains of animals that were buried in the ancient lime\r\nmuds. These preserved _remains_[3] are called fossils. The geologist who\r\nspecializes in the study of fossils is called a _paleontologist_. You\r\nmay ask, “What can fossils tell me about the past?” In the first place,\r\nfossils tell us at what time in the past the sediments in which they are\r\nfound were deposited. In this way, the _relative age_[4] of the rock\r\nlayers found in the Park can be learned. Secondly, the environment or\r\nsurroundings in which these ancient sediments were deposited can be\r\nreconstructed from the types of fossils contained within them. Certain\r\nanimals living today are quite similar to those in the Park rocks and\r\ntheir environment in today’s sea can be used to reconstruct the\r\nenvironment of animals which lived in the past. The characteristics of\r\nthe rocks and their relation to adjacent rocks are considered in any\r\nreconstruction of past environment. In the third place, the study of\r\nfossils is a mainstay of the theory of evolution. That is to say,\r\nchanges in fossil forms collected from groups of successively younger\r\nrock layers document the theory that life has evolved little by little\r\nsince its first appearance on Earth. Finally, it should be mentioned\r\nthat some animals found as fossils are not living today and have not\r\nlived, to the best of our knowledge, for millions of years. Why did\r\nthese forms of life die out? What set of circumstances led to their\r\nextinction? The answers to these questions are not easy to find and they\r\nare highly speculative.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.

Plate 1 will help you to identify these fossils. The name,\r\nphylum (major group) and age of each fossil are provided in the\r\nexplanation of the plate. The following paragraphs describe each phylum\r\nrepresented in the Park rocks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Plate 1. Typical fossils found in the Glens Falls\r\n    Limestone.]\r\n\r\n_Arthropods._ D.A.R. State Park rocks contain trilobites with the\r\nfollowing imposing names: _Cryptolithus tesselatus_ (crip-toe-LITH-us\r\ntessell-AH-tus[5]), _Isotelus gigas_ (ice-so-TELL-us GIG-us) and\r\n_Flexicalymene senaria_ (flex-eye-cal-ah-Mean-ee sen-AREA). These\r\nfossils are figured on Plate 1, 1-A, B, C, D; 2; 3. Within the Park\r\n_Cryptolithus tesselatus_ is very common wherever fossils occur.\r\nGenerally only the cephalon or head portion of this trilobite is\r\npreserved. The cephalon is easily recognized by three concentric rows of\r\npits arranged around the brim. _Cryptolithus_ is an excellent _index\r\nfossil_[6] for the Park rocks. The arthropod phylum is characterized by\r\nanimals with jointed legs, segmented bodies and a jointed outer armour\r\nof _chitin_.[7] For examples, the crabs, lobsters, spiders, scorpions\r\nand insects are arthropods. Trilobites appear early in the fossil record\r\nbut they did not survive beyond the Paleozoic Era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Explanation for Plate 1_\r\n           (_all drawings are X1 unless otherwise indicated_)\r\n\r\n1-A. _Cryptolithus tesselatus_, Arthropod (Trilobite), Middle Ordovician\r\n      (Trenton Stage).

Pen points to a colonial Bryozoan _Prasopora_ “head.”\r\n    These “heads” are very common just south or to your left if walking\r\n    down the ramp.]\r\n\r\n_Brachiopods._ Brachiopods are abundant in the Park rocks (see Plate 1,\r\n4A, B; 5; 6; 9; 10; 11; 12). These invertebrates are small marine\r\nanimals which generally live in waters no deeper than 600 feet. The two\r\nvalves of their shell are joined at the back (posterior) end of the body\r\nalong a hingeline of interlocking teeth and sockets. The shell of the\r\nbrachiopod is opened or shut by muscles attached to the inside of each\r\nvalve. Brachiopods are found in the oldest rocks containing definite and\r\nabundant fossils. Brachiopods are still living today.\r\n\r\n_Bryozoans._ Bryozoans or “moss animals” are very small marine animals\r\nwhich live in colonies. The bryozoans construct their mutual home or\r\ncolony of lime which is commonly preserved for the fossil record. Large\r\ncolonies of the fossil Prasopora (prah-sop-OR-ah) are commonly seen on\r\nthe weathered surfaces of many of the rock layers in the Park (see Plate\r\n1; 7A, B, C; 8 and Figure 5). Individuals of one genus common here, can\r\nbe recognized by their chocolate drop shapes. Bryozoans first appear in\r\nlower Paleozoic rocks and are still living today in clear\r\nwell-circulated shallow to deep marine water. Considering all of the\r\nfossils found in the Park rocks, the past environment is thought to have\r\nbeen a relatively shallow and warm sea.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6. This photograph shows the typical thickness\r\n    of the Glens Falls Limestone beds in the Park area. Note the massive\r\n    nature of the limestone bed. The 5-inch pen in the center of the\r\n    picture is for scale.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Sections illustrating the geologic history of\r\n    D.A.R. State Park.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROCKS AND THEIR HISTORY\r\n\r\nApproximately 75 vertical feet of the Glens Falls Limestone occur along\r\nthe Park beach. The rocks are _black_[8] or blue-black on a fresh\r\nsurface, gray or grayish-white on a surface which has been exposed to\r\nthe weather. Most of the individual beds or layers are 5 to 7 inches\r\nthick (see Fig. 6) with the thickest being just under 5 feet. The beds\r\nare separated by thin “partings” of rock, many of which contain abundant\r\nfossils. The beds consist of massive limestone, shaly limestone or limy\r\nshale; the partings are generally limy shale or shaly limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Explanation for Figure 7_\r\n\r\n1. Glens Falls and younger sediments were deposited on the Ordovician\r\nsea floor.\r\n\r\n2. Sediments hardened into Glens Falls Limestone and younger rocks.\r\n\r\n3. Rocks were tilted during the late Ordovician Taconic Disturbance and\r\nthe younger rocks and part of the Glens Falls Limestone were removed by\r\nerosion. Erosion continued for some 350 million years.\r\n\r\n4. During the Pleistocene Epoch, which started some 1 million years ago,\r\nglacial ice overrode the beveled layers of the Glens Falls Limestone.\r\nHard rocks frozen to the underside of the glacial ice produced scratches\r\nor striations in the exposed layers of the Glens Falls Limestone.\r\n\r\n5. Glacial lakes Vermont form as the glaciers retreat northward. In\r\nbetween the glacial lakes Vermont and present Lake Champlain, marine\r\nwaters flooded the valley and formed an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. Clay,\r\nsilt, sand and gravel were deposited on glaciated Glens Falls Limestone\r\n(Fig. 1a).\r\n\r\n6. Present-day Lake Champlain formed when relatively greater uplift in\r\nthe north dammed the Champlain valley.\r\n\r\nThe rock types found in the Park lead to certain conclusions regarding\r\nthe environment which existed during their formation. Most of the rocks\r\nare composed of lime (limestone) or a mixture of lime, fine sand and mud\r\n(limy shale or shaly limestone). The mineral pyrite (FeS₂) is present in\r\nmany of the rocks. Most of the rocks contain abundant amounts of organic\r\nmatter. The sediments which make up these rocks were carried to the\r\nOrdovician sea by streams flowing primarily from the east. As these\r\nstreams entered the quiet sea waters the larger followed by the smaller\r\nparticles began to settle to the bottom. Lime was slowly precipitated\r\nfrom the warm sea water and pyrite formed under stagnant bottom\r\nconditions. Organic material accumulated on the bottom and intermixed\r\nwith the sediments. The poor life-sustaining qualities of much of the\r\nbottom waters prevented rapid or complete bacterial action on the\r\naccumulated debris and the sediments remained “organic black” in color.\r\nSlowly, as the weight of overlying sediments increased, the lower layers\r\nwere compacted and cemented into the hard limestone and shale which we\r\nsee today.\r\n\r\nThe tilt or dip of the Park rocks resulted from subsequent earth\r\nmovements. When were these rocks tilted? From the evidence presented in\r\nthe Park all that can be said is that they were tilted sometime after\r\nhardening and before the Pleistocene glaciers overrode the region during\r\nquite recent times (at least 10,000 years ago). Thus, there are some 350\r\nmillion years of rock record missing in the Park. Can we tell what\r\nhappened during these “missing” years through a study of only the Park\r\nrocks? The answer to this question is partially “yes,” but we must look\r\nto the work done in adjacent areas for a more complete story.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that there are no rocks representing these millions of\r\nyears tells us that the sea had withdrawn from the area and that the\r\npreviously deposited rocks were undergoing erosion during most or all of\r\nthe missing rock gap (the time not represented by rocks). Information\r\nfrom adjacent areas, however, tells us that the Park rocks were tilted\r\nduring the Taconic Disturbance which occurred during the final stages of\r\nthe Ordovician Period. East of the Park, Taconic earth movements are\r\nmore dramatically exhibited. The rocks are tilted even more than in the\r\nPark and are broken by faults or cracks in the earth’s crust. Some of\r\nthese faults, known as thrust faults, positioned giant slabs of rock far\r\nfrom their original locations and placed older on top of younger rocks.\r\n\r\nFollowing these earth movements there occurred a long period of erosion.\r\nMany of the rock layers were stripped off and carried piece by piece by\r\nrivers to other regions. Hundreds of millions of years passed and then,\r\nless than one million years ago the great glacial ice sheets slowly\r\nadvanced southward over the Park area. Pieces of hard rock frozen to the\r\nunderside of the ice sheets scratched and scraped the rock surfaces\r\nleaving these scratches or striations for us to see today (near the\r\nnorthern end of the Park beach these striations are common on the\r\noutcropping rock). The retreating glaciers created a series of lakes in\r\nwhich clay, silt, sand and gravel were deposited. Today these sediments\r\nare found resting on the beveled edges of the Park rocks.\r\n\r\nPresent-day Lake Champlain owes its existence to a general uplift of the\r\nearth’s surface, greater in the north than in the south, perhaps due to\r\nthe removal of the heavy glacial ice sheet from the area. The greater\r\nuplift in the north dammed the Champlain valley which slowly filled with\r\nwater. For a diagrammatic picture of the geologic history of D.A.R.\r\nState Park, see Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SUGGESTED READING\r\n\r\n\r\nBeerbower, J.

Philo State Forest Park, consisting of some 160 acres, is located\r\nabout 15 miles south of Burlington and 1 mile east of U.S. Route 7 (see\r\nmap, Fig. 1). This park is noted for its scenic views, especially of the\r\nbroad Champlain Valley and the rugged Adirondack Mountains beyond (see\r\ncover picture and Fig. 7a). From a 46-foot high observation tower a\r\npanoramic view is easily gained. Picnic facilities, including stone\r\nfireplaces, fuel wood, piped spring water and sanitary facilities are\r\navailable. A large rustic lodge with porch and portico provides\r\nprotection from sudden showers. Tenting on the top of Mt. Philo is not\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGY OF THE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _The Rocks_\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the Park which will probably first attract your attention\r\nare those exposed at the main western Overlook which is located in the\r\nsummit area. This Overlook is found just northwest of the Park lodge\r\n(see Fig. 8). These rocks are light to dark red or purplish in color,\r\nare primarily _quartzite with minor dolostone_[9] dipping approximately\r\n35 degrees to the northeast (for an explanation of dip, see Fig. 3 and\r\ntext of D.A.R. State Park, page 6) and striking toward the northwest\r\n(for an explanation of strike, see immediately preceding reference).\r\n\r\nA closer look at this Monkton Quartzite outcrop shows that it is made up\r\nof several layers of rock (see Fig. 8). These layers, strata, or beds\r\nare not all of the same thickness, but are generally from 1 inch to 1\r\nfoot thick. If an individual layer is traced over the extent of the\r\noutcrop, it is found that its thickness remains about the same\r\nthroughout. It is therefore said to be regularly bedded. Thin\r\nlaminations of dark red shale are abundant and commonly define\r\nindividual layers. A magnified look at a specimen of this quartzite,\r\nunder a hand lens, shows that it is composed of fine to coarse fragments\r\nof quartz. Some of these fragments have rounded edges, but others are\r\nquite angular. The spaces between the fragments are filled with silica\r\n(quartz). Therefore, the rock is said to possess a silica cement.\r\n\r\nIn many places where this Monkton Quartzite has been studied, features\r\nattesting to a shallow water origin have been found. Among these\r\nfeatures are mud cracks, which form under alternating wet and dry\r\nconditions; ripple marks, which are usually found only on shallow water\r\nbottoms; and cross-bedding, which commonly forms in shallow water areas.\r\n\r\nThe Monkton Quartzite underlies approximately a third of the Park (see\r\nGeologic map, Fig. 9). This quartzite is between 250 and 300 feet thick\r\non Mt. Philo; however, the lower 50 feet or so consist predominantly of\r\nwhite quartzite interbedded with dolostone. The age of the Monkton\r\nQuartzite is considered to be Lower Cambrian (see Standard Geologic Time\r\nScale, Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Geologic Map of Mt. Philo State Forest Park\r\n    (after C. W. Welby. 1961). Because Ogf and Oib were not definitely\r\n    identified by the author of this pamphlet and for the sake of\r\n    simplicity, these rock units have not been discussed in the text of\r\n    the pamphlet.

This is the _black_[10] to\r\nbluish-black Stony Point Shale (see Fig. 10), which underlies the\r\nMonkton quartzite. This shale, or hardened limy mud, is thinbedded and\r\nshows abundant _cleavage_[11] parallel to the layers or beds. At this\r\noutcrop the layers strike to the northeast and dip 20 to 40 degrees\r\ntoward the southeast. The dip and strike of the Monkton Quartzite (see\r\nabove) is not similar to the dip and strike of the underlying Stony\r\nPoint Shale. It follows, that the layers of the Monkton Quartzite are\r\nnot parallel to those of the Stony Point Shale.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10. View looking south of cut-bank, south side\r\n    of exit road, about 0.7 miles down from the summit parking area.\r\n    Here the layers dip 20 to 40 degrees toward the southeast and strike\r\n    in a northeast direction. Note that the shale is thin-bedded and\r\n    contains numerous cleavage planes parallel to the layering. The\r\n    handle of the geologic pick is about 1 foot long.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that these two units are not parallel could mean that the Stony\r\nPoint Shale was deposited, hardened into rock, uplifted, folded and\r\neroded, all prior to the deposition of the Monkton Quartzite. But,\r\nfirst, what is the age of the underlying Stony Point Shale? If the story\r\nis as listed above, the Stony Point Shale _must be older_[12] than the\r\noverlying Monkton Quartzite. From the fossil animal remains found in the\r\nStony Point Shale, geologists have dated the Stony Point Shale as upper\r\nmiddle Ordovician (see Standard Geologic Time Scale, Fig. 4). And so,\r\nhere we have older rocks (Lower Cambrian) resting on younger (upper\r\nmiddle Ordovician).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11. View of Mt. Philo, looking toward the\r\n    northeast. The black line approximates the position of the thrust\r\n    fault. The Monkton Quartzite, which is above the line, was thrust\r\n    westward over the Stony Point Shale (note the arrow). Line A-B, Fig.\r\n    9, approximates the section.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Structural Geology_\r\n\r\nHow can we explain this inverted order of rock units? The geologic\r\nevidence presented in the Park does not indicate that folding of the\r\nrocks was responsible. From the surface distribution of the two rock\r\ntypes (see Geologic map, Fig. 9) and the nature of their contact with\r\neach other, a fault relation is envisioned, in which older rocks were\r\nthrust westward over the younger and thus to rest upon them (see Fig. 11\r\n).\r\n\r\nWe know the ages of both rock units involved in this thrust fault but\r\nwhat is the geologic age of the actual thrust movement? Both the Stony\r\nPoint Shale and the Monkton Quartzite were hard rock when this thrusting\r\ntook place, therefore, the thrusting would have occurred later than\r\nupper middle Ordovician time, but before late Silurian time. Two other\r\nfault systems are recognized in or near the Park (see Geologic map, Fig.\r\n9). They are _high angle_[13] faults which formed later than the thrust\r\nfault, but still preceding late Silurian time.\r\n\r\nThe Iberville Shale (this is not described in the section on “The\r\nRocks,” but is seen on the Geologic map, Fig. 9), which is questionably\r\nexposed on the south side of Mt. Philo, would be the youngest rock found\r\nin the Park. This shale is about 390 million years old. The most recent\r\nfaulting took place no later than about 340 million years ago. There are\r\nno rocks in the Park which give us any positive geological clues to the\r\nPark’s history from the last episode of faulting to the Pleistocene\r\nglaciers less than 1 million years ago. However, the fact that rocks\r\nrepresenting this interval of time are not present does indicate that\r\nthe area was above water during most of these 339 million years (this\r\nnumber of years is very approximate). If any rocks were deposited during\r\nthis “rock-gap” period, they have since been washed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Pleistocene Deposits_\r\n\r\nBeginning between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago two glacial advances and\r\nretreats took place in the Champlain Valley. This was during the most\r\nrecent or the Wisconsin Stage of the Pleistocene Epoch. Scratches or\r\nstriations were cut into the overridden rock by rock debris carried\r\nalong at the base of the ice as it advanced (note the arrow in (“br”)\r\narea at overlook in Fig. 12; this shows striation orientation,\r\ntherefore, the direction in which the glacier advanced). The glacial\r\nsediments found on Mt. Philo were deposited during the final retreat of\r\nglacial ice, which took place from 11,000 to 12,000 years ago. Most of\r\nthe Park is covered with these glacial deposits and by more recent\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nMost of the glacial deposits found on Mt. Philo are classified as\r\nglacial _till_[14] (see Map of Glacial Deposits, Fig. 12), but other\r\nglacial deposits are also mapped. A _kame_[15] (designated “K” in Fig.\r\n12) is a glacial feature found in the southern part of the Park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12. Map of the Pleistocene deposits of Mt. Philo\r\n    State Forest Park (after D. P. Stewart, 1961).]\r\n\r\n  LEGEND\r\n    bc  Boulder strewn lake sediments\r\n    bgm  Marine beach gravel\r\n    bg  Beach gravel\r\n    ps  Pebbly sand\r\n    ls  Lake sand\r\n    t  Till\r\n    k  Kame\r\n    br Bedrock\r\n  Park roads\r\n  Other roads\r\n\r\nWith the slow retreat of the glacial ice front from the Mt. Philo\r\nregion, deposits were left which indicate that a series of lakes formed\r\nin front of the wasting ice mass. There is also evidence just west of\r\nMt. Philo (see “bgm” in Fig. 12) which indicates that just prior to the\r\nformation of present-day Lake Champlain, an arm of the Atlantic Ocean\r\nreached into the Champlain Valley from the St. Lawrence River region.\r\nLake-beach gravels (designated “bg” in Fig. 12) are found on both the\r\neast and west slopes of Mt. Philo. The interesting fact about these\r\nbeach gravels is that they occur almost 500 feet above the present-day\r\nlevel of Lake Champlain. Lake sand (designated “ls” in Fig. 12) is found\r\nsome 450 feet above Lake Champlain. This means that during a good\r\nportion of its recent geologic history, Mt. Philo was an island\r\nsurrounded by lake water. From the distribution of marine beach gravel\r\n(designated “bgm” in Fig. 12), it appears that the invasion of sea water\r\nfrom the St. Lawrence region did not isolate Mt. Philo as an island.\r\n\r\nThe complete story of the lake series is still not known, but, for the\r\nmost up-to-date treatment of this subject see D. P. Stewart’s paper\r\nentitled “The glacial geology of Vermont”: Vermont Geological Survey\r\nBulletin 19 (1961). Suggested also is C. H. Chapman’s article entitled\r\n“Late glacial and postglacial history of the Champlain valley” in the\r\nAmerican Journal of Science, 5th series, volume 34, pages 89-124 (1937).\r\nLooking out over the Champlain lowlands from the summit of Mt. Philo\r\nleaves little doubt in the visitor’s mind as to the prior existence of\r\nlakes which surrounded Mt. Philo in the not too distant past (see Cover\r\npicture).\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Summary of the Geologic History_\r\n\r\nDuring lower Cambrian time, the Monkton Quartzite and dolostone followed\r\nby the Winooski Dolostone (not seen in the Park) were deposited east of\r\nMt. Philo State Forest Park. During late Cambrian and early Ordovician,\r\nthick dolostones were deposited from the sea water which covered the Mt.\r\nPhilo area (not seen at the surface in the Park).\r\n\r\nDuring middle Ordovician time, a series of shale, calcareous shale and\r\nlimestone was deposited from the sea water. Then, sometime between the\r\nbeginning of late Ordovician and late Silurian time, the eastern lower\r\nCambrian sequence was thrust westward over the middle Ordovician rocks.\r\nThis low-angle thrusting was succeeded by high angle faulting.\r\n\r\nThe Park rocks were subjected to weathering and erosion for over 300\r\nmillion years or until glaciers advanced over the area less than 60,000\r\nto 70,000 years ago. Advancing glaciers scoured the rock; retreating or\r\nwasting glacial ice left deposits of clay, sand and gravel in the Park.\r\nA series of lakes formed south of the northward wasting glacial ice and\r\ndeposits of beach-gravel and lake-sand formed along the slopes of Mt.\r\nPhilo, which was then an island. An arm of the sea next advanced\r\nsouthward into the Champlain Valley leaving marine beach-gravels just\r\nwest of Mt. Philo. The marine waters retreated and present-day Lake\r\nChamplain came into existence. The formation of the present soil cover\r\nand the deposition of recent alluvium from presently flowing rivers and\r\nstreams concludes this brief summary of the Park’s geologic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SUGGESTED READING\r\n (_in addition to the general references listed for D.A.R.

Tenting, picnicking and swimming are the Parks main\r\nattractions (Fig. 12a). The swimming beach is on the north side of U.S.\r\nRoute 2 and fronts on Lake Champlain. Its shallowness makes the beach\r\nsafe for children (Fig. 13). The tenting facilities are located on the\r\nsouth side of U.S. Route 2 on a south-facing shoreline.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGY OF THE PARK\r\n\r\nThe geologic history of Sand Bar State Park is recent, geologically\r\nspeaking, especially when compared with that of the other Parks treated\r\nin this pamphlet. The sediments of the park are blue and brown clay\r\nwhich were deposited throughout the Champlain Valley less than 10,000\r\nyears ago. This clay, which can be seen in many places along the bathing\r\nbeach, was deposited from marine waters which flooded the Champlain\r\nValley just prior to the formation of present-day Lake Champlain. No\r\nbedrock crops out in Sand Bar State Park.\r\n\r\nThe blue clay is covered with deposits brought downstream by the\r\nLamoille River during very recent times and deposited as a _delta_[16]\r\ninto Lake Champlain. This delta has shifted its distributary channels\r\nfrequently and continues to grow southwestwardly into Lake Champlain.\r\nMuch of the finer material (sand) brought into Lake Champlain by the\r\nLamoille River has been shifted and concentrated by lake currents into\r\nridges or bars; one sand bar stretches to South Hero Island and forms\r\nthe foundation for the causeway named Sand Bar Bridge. Prior to the\r\nbuilding of Sand Bar Bridge (causeway was started in 1849, opened to\r\ntravel on December 5, 1850), this sand bar was fordable and was used as\r\na link between South Hero Island and the mainland.\r\n\r\nMost of the sand now found north of the Park bathing beach and which is\r\nresponsible for the extensive “shallows” in the swimming area, was\r\nsupplied by the now abandoned northern channel of the Lamoille River. It\r\nis interesting to note that most of the sand now seen on the bathing\r\nbeach has been imported from nearby areas of Vermont. Since the northern\r\ndistributary channel of the Lamoille River is no longer supplying sand,\r\nand sand from the active southern channel cannot work its way northward\r\nbecause of the Sand Bar Bridge causeway, there is a lack of sand for the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThe extensive swamp areas near the east end of Sand Bar Bridge are a\r\nwildlife sanctuary. The north-trending prominent escarpment east of the\r\nPark marks the trace of the Champlain thrust fault (Fig. 13). In a\r\nquarry at the east end of Sand Bar Bridge may be seen the fault contact\r\nbetween the younger, Middle Ordovician, Stony Point Formation, and the\r\nolder, Lower Cambrian, Dunham Dolomite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SUGGESTED READING\r\n\r\n\r\nErwin, R.

For a diagram illustrating the dip and strike of\r\n    a rock layer see Figure 3.\r\n\r\n[2]This is one of the three major rock groups or families. The first\r\n    consists of igneous rocks, including granite, syenite, and basalt,\r\n    which were formed by solidification of molten rock-material. The\r\n    igneous rocks are ancestors of the other two rock families; they\r\n    form over 90 percent of the outer 10 miles of the Earth’s crust. The\r\n    second family, consisting of sedimentary or layered rocks including\r\n    shale, sandstone and limestone, is composed of pieces and grains and\r\n    other materials from all the families of rocks. In addition,\r\n    sedimentary rocks are formed also from lime secreted by marine\r\n    plants and animals or chemically precipitated from sea water, or by\r\n    the accumulations of shells. The third family, metamorphic rocks,\r\n    including gneiss, schist, slate and marble, were igneous or\r\n    sedimentary rocks that have been subjected to heat and pressure in\r\n    the presence of mineral-forming solutions. Metamorphic rocks\r\n    generally look different from the rocks from which they formed,\r\n    because the original minerals of the rock have been changed and\r\n    reoriented.\r\n\r\n[3]The actual remains are usually not preserved in their original state\r\n    but are represented by molds and casts. Picture an ancient sea. The\r\n    sea bottom mud slowly hardens around a shell. Water then seeps\r\n    through the hardened mud and dissolves the shell leaving an open\r\n    space where the shell once was. This open space is a mold. If the\r\n    mold is filled a copy of the original shell is formed. This is\r\n    called a cast.\r\n\r\n[4]The relative rather than the absolute age of the rocks can be\r\n    determined from a study of their fossil content. These fossils are\r\n    compared with collections from various places in the world where the\r\n    standard geologic time scale assigns them a place (see Fig. 4). The\r\n    Park rocks were deposited during the Ordovician Period. How is a\r\n    standard geologic time scale put together? Several geologists first\r\n    worked out the sequences of rocks according to the Law of\r\n    Superposition in Great Britain and neighboring parts of Europe. When\r\n    systematic collections of fossils were made from these layers and\r\n    arranged according to age it was found that certain fossils\r\n    occurring in rocks in distant areas were identical and occupied the\r\n    same relative age position. These fossils were considered to be of\r\n    the same relative age. Fossils found in the Park can be compared\r\n    with these reference fossils and a relative geologic age can be\r\n    assigned to them. Absolute ages can be determined in some cases by\r\n    the use of rates of decay of radioactive elements and in general\r\n    these ages agree with the relative ages derived through the use of\r\n    fossils.\r\n\r\n[5]The capitalized syllable is the accented syllable.\r\n\r\n[6]An index fossil is used to date the rocks in which it occurs. A good\r\n    index fossil must be abundant, widespread and easily recognized. Its\r\n    vertical range is restricted to a small number of rock layers,\r\n    therefore the geological span of life of a good index fossil is\r\n    usually short.\r\n\r\n[7]Chitin is a colorless horny substance similar to the material which\r\n    makes up fingernails.\r\n\r\n[8]The black color is due to an abundance of finely divided organic\r\n    (plant and animal) material within the rock.\r\n\r\n[9]A quartzite is either a metamorphic or sedimentary rock consisting of\r\n    fragments of the mineral quartz (SiO₂) which are cemented together\r\n    by silica (quartz). The combination of quartz fragments held\r\n    together by quartz cement creates a very hard rock which oftentimes\r\n    will break across the fragments rather than around them. The\r\n    quartzites of the Park area are primarily of a sedimentary origin.\r\n    For a description of the three major rock groups, of which the\r\n    sedimentary and metamorphic groups are two, see footnote, D.A.R.\r\n    State Park, page 6. A dolostone is a sedimentary rock composed of\r\n    fragmental, concretionary, or precipitated dolomite (a mineral of\r\n    chemical composition, CaMg(CO₃)₂) of organic or inorganic origin.\r\n\r\n[10]The black color is due to the inclusion of finely disseminated\r\n    carbonaceous material (animal and plant remains) within the rock.\r\n\r\n[11]This splitting or cleavage was produced after the layers had\r\n    hardened into rock. The cleavage planes were produced when the rocks\r\n    were subjected to pressures too great to withstand. In some places\r\n    these cleavage planes do not parallel the layers.\r\n\r\n[12]According to the basic geologic law, the Law of Superposition,\r\n    younger rocks (those deposited last) are always found resting on\r\n    older rocks (those deposited before the younger). The only time that\r\n    this is not true is when either breaks (faults) or folds in the\r\n    earth’s crust place the layers in an inverted order, as in the case\r\n    here cited.\r\n\r\n[13]The fault plane of a high-angle fault forms a large angle (generally\r\n    from 30 to 90 degrees) at its intersection with an imaginary\r\n    horizontal plane. The plane of a thrust fault, or low-angle fault,\r\n    forms a small angle (generally less than 30 degrees) at its\r\n    intersection with an imaginary horizontal plane.\r\n\r\n[14]This is the Burlington till (Stewart, 1961) and was deposited from\r\n    the Burlington Ice Lobe during its period of wasting. The till is a\r\n    hodge-podge mixture of clay, sand and pebbles and is usually brown\r\n    in color.\r\n\r\n[15]A kame is a mound or ridge of poorly sorted (sometimes well-sorted,\r\n    that is, made up of all the same sized particles) water deposited\r\n    materials. Most kames are ice-contact features; that is to say, the\r\n    materials which make up the kame were deposited in contact with a\r\n    glacial ice surface. The Mt. Philo kame may be the filling of an\r\n    ice-free area during the final melting of the glacial ice.\r\n\r\n[16]Delta is the name of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, the\r\n    capital form of which is an equilateral triangle. The\r\n    triangular-shaped tract of land formed by the deposit of river\r\n    sediment at river mouths is named for the triangular shape of the\r\n    capital Greek letter delta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
