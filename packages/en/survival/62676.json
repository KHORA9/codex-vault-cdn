In the city the\r\nsanitary condition of homes is maintained chiefly by a system of\r\ncooperation and centralization which brings into existence extensive\r\nsewerage systems, water supplies, and the collection of house waste by\r\npublic authority. Regulations are prescribed and enforced under which\r\nthe individual household must avoid all conditions which are likely to\r\nprove dangerous to the health of the immediate neighborhood and of the\r\nentire community. In the country districts, and more particularly in\r\nisolated homesteads, the conditions affecting the health of the household\r\nare largely in its own hands, and more individual effort is required to\r\nmaintain healthful surroundings than in cities. The farmer must supply\r\nhimself with his drinking water and must get rid of the waste of the\r\nhousehold as best he can. On the other hand, the inhabitant of the country\r\nis in many ways better off than the dweller in large cities. Not only\r\nhas he pure air to draw upon at all times, but he can supply himself\r\noften with purer food than is possible in large communities. Though he\r\nmust procure for himself drinking water, he is, in most cases, able to\r\nget a purer water from the ground than the sewage-polluted fluid which\r\nis the only water accessible in many cities. While he must get rid of\r\nnight soil himself rather than have it disposed of by a water-carriage\r\nsystem conveniently located within the house, he may avoid the annoying\r\ncomplications of plumbing, bringing with it the leakages of sewer gas, the\r\nplugging up of soil pipes by the roots of trees or by articles carelessly\r\nthrown into them. Moreover, he has it often within his power to acquire\r\nsufficient land around his house to take charge of all sewage and waste\r\nand to utilize it as a manure for enriching the soil. Nevertheless, it\r\nmust be acknowledged that when the circumstances under which healthful\r\nsurroundings are procurable are under the immediate control of each\r\nindividual household they are apt to be perverted through ignorance and\r\nneglect. Conditions may then arise which are not only unfavorable to\r\nhealth, but which are likely to lead to severe sickness at any time when\r\nthe opportunity presents itself.\r\n\r\nStanding between the fortunate inhabitant of a large city whose\r\nwater-supply and sewerage systems are above reproach and the farmer\r\nwho bas it within his power to make them so with reference to his own\r\nwants, is the half-developed village or town, with its chiefly unsanitary\r\nconditions. Here the leaky cesspool still exists, close by the family\r\nwell, or by the neighbor's well. The absence of any system of collecting\r\ngarbage and miscellaneous waste shows itself by the littering of the\r\nyards, the alleys, streets, and even stream beds with all kinds of\r\nrefuse. In some towns the premature introduction of a water-supply system\r\ncauses the ground to become still more thoroughly saturated with diluted\r\nsewage, so that the wells of those households not yet connected with\r\nthe water-supply are a continual source of danger. In such communities,\r\nappreciation of the necessity for a public control of sanitation has not\r\nyet made much headway. The acts of each family violating the laws of\r\nhealth not only react upon itself but upon the immediate neighborhood,\r\noften with disastrous results. When typhoid fever has once gained a\r\nfoothold in such communities it is apt to develop into an epidemic.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of our population to concentrate in villages and towns makes\r\nthe sanitary improvement of such communities a most important and vital\r\ncondition of national health and prosperity. The following pages are not\r\nintended for these communities, for they need, in most cases, the advice\r\nof sanitarians and sanitary engineers, acquainted with local conditions.\r\nStill, they may be of service in pointing out the dangers which may and do\r\nactually beset the population that neglects to dispose of refuse and waste\r\nin a manner which does not clash with the laws of health.\r\n\r\nThe chief dangers which threaten rural inhabitants are those arising from\r\npolluted drinking water. This is infected from the household excrement and\r\nbarnyard drainage, as will be described farther on, and its use leads in\r\nthe main to bowel disturbances, typhoid-fever, and dysenteric affections.\r\nIt might be claimed that in an isolated homestead the danger is absent\r\nbecause the night soil from the healthy household can not contain the\r\ngerms of typhoid-fever, and, therefore, the well water can not receive\r\nthem from leaky cesspools and surface drainage. This would be true if\r\nthe family lived secluded from other human beings. As the case stands,\r\nthere is much more communication than is at first thought supposed. There\r\nis more or less coming and going of farm hands and other hired help,\r\nof tramps, peddlers, etc. The farmer travels more than formerly. He\r\nfrequently visits neighboring communities. The children go to school. As\r\nit has been shown that there may be mild cases of typhoid-fever passing\r\nunnoticed, in a farm hand, for example, who leaves on account of ill\r\nhealth, perhaps, and who has meanwhile, in his discharges, deposited the\r\ngerms of this disease on the premises, it is evident that isolation\r\nnowadays does not exist except in remote, thinly settled regions, and that\r\ndisease germs may make themselves suddenly felt in an unexpected manner in\r\nany farmhouse.\r\n\r\nThere are other important reasons, however, why rural sanitation should\r\nnot be neglected. The health of the large communities of people who draw\r\ntheir food supply from the country is in a measure dependent on the health\r\nof the farming community. There is scarcely a city child who is not, in a\r\ndegree, dependent for its health on the sanitary conditions prevailing in\r\nthe house of the dairyman. Milk has been repeatedly shown to be the means\r\nof distributing typhoid-fever and other diseases. Any vegetable foods\r\nfrom the farm eaten raw are liable to become carriers of infection under\r\nunsanitary conditions.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of our country other causes operate in making the health\r\nof many people depend on the proprieties of country homes. The thousands\r\nof city people, who flock every summer to the country and bring to the\r\nfarming community considerable sums of money, should be properly protected\r\nagainst the dangers of polluted water and infected milk by the adoption\r\nof suitable methods of sewage disposal. Too frequently those who left the\r\ncity for the purpose of gaining strength by breathing pure air, drinking\r\npure water, and eating pure food, only return with the germs of an often\r\nfatal disease within them to swell the typhoid statistics of our large\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL OF SEWAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vital thing which thus presents itself is the disposal of fecal matter\r\nand other refuse so that the wells, upon which most rural families depend\r\nfor their drinking water, may remain pure. To this matter we will first\r\nturn our attention.\r\n\r\nEvery person who tills the soil is acquainted with the remarkable\r\ntransforming power of the superficial layers of the earth upon manure and\r\nexcrement. Out of these offensive wastes harmless substances are produced\r\nwhich are essential to the growth of vegetation. This power, known as\r\ndecay, is now generally attributed to very minute organisms (bacteria)\r\nwhich are found in immense numbers in the superficial layers of the soil,\r\nwhich diminish in number as we go deeper, and which completely disappear\r\nbelow a depth of 6 to 12 feet, according to the physical condition of\r\nthe soil. Bacteria are more numerous where waste and excrement are most\r\nabundant. When night soil and manure are deposited in excavations or\r\nso-called cesspools in the earth, from which the fluid matter may enter\r\nthe ground at some depth below the surface, where the air or certain kinds\r\nof bacteria can penetrate only to a slight extent, the substances, which\r\nunder the influence of the air (oxygen) and of bacteria near the surface,\r\nwould have decayed, now undergo partial putrefaction with the setting\r\nfree of disagreeable gases and odors. The deeper layers of the earth\r\nslowly become saturated with organic matter, which is carried by the\r\nground-water into the wells or springs near by. There is also some reason\r\nto believe that disease germs live longer in the oxygen-free depths of the\r\nsoil than at or near the surface.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the filling up of the soil with excrementitious matter\r\nmay go on in densely populated cities has been shown by Fodor for the\r\nHungarian city Budapest. By analyzing the soil at different levels from\r\nthe surface to a depth of about 13 feet, he found, over an area comprising\r\n15 acres, about 1,000,000,000 pounds organic matter, equivalent to the\r\nexcrement of 100,000 people voided during thirty-seven years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--The shallow barnyard well, with privy vault and\r\nmanure heaps near by. The water is likely to receive fluid from these at\r\nany time.]\r\n\r\nTo the surface of the earth we owe thus a purifying influence whose\r\nactivity furnishes us vegetation and food on the one hand and preservation\r\nfrom disease on the other. This purifying power is not possessed by the\r\ndeeper layers, and therefore the percolation of organic refuse into them\r\nfrom deep cesspools is wasteful to agriculture and dangerous to our\r\nstorehouse of drinking water.\r\n\r\nEven the surface of the soil when overloaded with sewage loses partially\r\nits power of purifying the organic matter. After sufficient rest, such an\r\noverloaded soil regains its original power. The purifying activity of the\r\nsoil from a sanitary aspect is the same as that governing fertility from\r\nan agricultural standpoint, hence any further discussion of this subject\r\nis unnecessary.\r\n\r\nA hint as to the proper disposition of waste, excrement, etc., is\r\nfurnished by what is stated above concerning the purifying capacities of\r\nthe earth's surface. Waste, night soil, etc., should be deposited with\r\nproper precautions on or immediately below the surface of the soil, where\r\nit may perform the double function of ridding the household of a nuisance\r\nand of enriching the soil itself. This leads us to a consideration of the\r\nbest means of taking care of the household wastes. These are, in general,\r\nof three classes: First, fecal matter; second, kitchen and chamber slops;\r\nand third, miscellaneous rubbish and ashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SOIL.\r\n\r\nThe proper disposition of fecal matter or night soil in the country has\r\nbeen one of the most pressing and vexatious problems of modern sanitation.\r\nMany plans have been suggested, much apparatus has been invented to meet\r\nthe difficulty, but opinions not only differ but change from year to year\r\nand have led to different practices in different countries. Moreover,\r\ndifferent climatic conditions and the divergent tendencies of rural\r\npopulations in the various sections of our own country make it impossible\r\nto apply the same scheme to the whole country. Different degrees of\r\nprosperity and wealth, even in the same locality, will bring into use\r\nwidely different schemes to accomplish the same end. There are in use\r\nseveral systems--\r\n\r\n_The privy._--The old-fashioned privy, at present still quite a common\r\nthing even in cities, is, perhaps, the most favored method of disposing of\r\nfecal matter in the country. A pit is dug and a small building set over\r\nit. The excrement deposited in it slowly fills it up. The fluids and the\r\nsolids dissolved by them penetrate the subsoil and diffuse themselves in\r\nthe ground. Rarely is such a pit cleaned out. Another is dug and the old\r\none covered up. In this way the ground becomes overloaded with refuse\r\norganic matter. It is even stated on good authority that such collections\r\nof fecal matter have been found under the dwelling; also, that the privy\r\nvaults have been dug until the current of ground-water was reached which\r\nwas to facilitate the removal of the excrement. It is difficult to\r\nconceive a more pernicious custom, or one more certain to pollute the\r\ndrinking water. The privy vault is the most rudimentary way of getting rid\r\nof night soil, and its dangerous features are too plain to be referred to.\r\n\r\n_The cesspool._--Next comes the cesspool, which is usually connected with\r\na water-closet, and may also receive the slops from the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThese are constructed in two ways, either as water-tight receptacles or as\r\nsimple pervious pits differing in no way from the privy vault excepting,\r\nperhaps, in their more dangerous tendencies. All sanitary authorities\r\nagree in condemning the leaky cesspool as a most shiftless and dangerous\r\nmethod of getting rid of sewage. In most countries they are prohibited\r\nby law in populous communities. In exceptional cases, leaky cesspools\r\nmay do no harm, as in an isolated house in the country whose cesspool is\r\nbuilt at a considerable distance both from the house and the well. The\r\nsafe distance from any well it would be difficult to state, because that\r\nwould depend on the character of the subsoil and the general slope of the\r\nland. In any case, the cesspool should be on lower ground than the well,\r\nas the current of the ground water feeding the latter, usually but not\r\nalways, conforms to the slope of the surface. A fair estimate of the least\r\nallowable distance between well and cesspool would be 100 feet. Soluble\r\nsalts from sewage might still find their way into the well water, but it\r\nis quite improbable that disease germs could penetrate the soil for such a\r\ndistance except where fissures and cracks may be present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Portable earth closet. A, the pail to receive the\r\nexcrement; B, the urine-separating receptacle hanging on the open door; C,\r\nmouth of the hopper conveying the dry-earth or ashes from reservoir D upon\r\nthe night soil in A.]\r\n\r\nIn villages, leaky cesspools are still of frequent occurrence. If the\r\ndrinking water is taken from wells, such cesspools are a constant menace,\r\nand all that is needed in many such towns is a spark in the shape of some\r\ndisease germ to kindle an epidemic. It is true that years may pass by\r\nwithout the occurrence of more than the usual amount of illness, but even\r\nthen we have good reason to suppose that in many villages using cesspools\r\nthe average amount of sickness and mortality is far too high, not to\r\nmention the occasional epidemics of typhoid-fever. We may sum up the\r\nmatter of leaky cesspools by the statement that they may do no harm near\r\nisolated houses on farms, provided they are sufficiently far away from the\r\nsource of water-supply. In small towns cesspools should be prohibited, or\r\nonly very thoroughly constructed water-tight ones permitted, according to\r\ncircumstances. The same holds true for the well-known privies.\r\n\r\n_The dry-earth closet._--The dry conservancy system is a much better\r\nmethod of disposal of excrement, and is extensively in use to-day even\r\nin certain large cities on the Continent of Europe where sewers have not\r\nyet been introduced. This consists in the main of the frequent removal of\r\nexcreta in the country by some man servant or member of the family; in\r\nvillages and towns according to some cooperative plan. This system has\r\ntaken various directions, according to circumstances. Thus there are what\r\nis called the pail system, which consists in the daily or less frequent\r\nremoval of a pail receiving the excreta; and the earth closet invented by\r\nthe Rev. Henry Moule, of England, the chief feature of which consists in\r\nthe covering of the excreta with some absorbent substance like dry-earth\r\nor ashes. In some places the excreta are received into a well-built brick\r\nor stone receptacle and covered with earth, from which they may be removed\r\nfrom time to time. Of these systems the dry-earth closet has received the\r\ngreatest amount of attention and discussion. It consists, essentially, of\r\na pail to receive night soil, which is covered either automatically or\r\nwith a scoop with dry-earth (fig. 2). The earth absorbs the fluids and the\r\nodors and keeps the closet inoffensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--The old form of earth closet with frame and pail\r\nremoved to show the mechanism. The handle on the left when raised throws\r\ninto the pail a certain quantity of dry-earth or ashes from the reservoir\r\nor hopper in the rear.]\r\n\r\nThe earth to be used should be a rather fine loam, sifted to remove\r\ncoarse particles, thoroughly dried by spreading out in the sun or under a\r\nshed, and then stored in barrels. The drier the earth the better it is.\r\nThe finer the particles of earth the greater the capacity for absorbing\r\nfluids. For this reason sand is not satisfactory. Goal or wood ashes are\r\nquite satisfactory, as they are, after proper sifting, of the requisite\r\nfineness and are thoroughly dry. The mixture of earth or ashes and night\r\nsoil should be removed at certain times, depending on the location of\r\nthe closet, the season of the year, and other conditions. The more\r\nfrequent the removal the better. The mixture of soil and excrement is so\r\nunobjectionable that it has been used over a number of times after being\r\ndried each time. This can not be recommended, however, as it is generally\r\naccepted nowadays that disease germs may remain alive in such a mixture\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\nIn place of the movable earth closets, a water-tight, concreted area\r\nmay be built in an annex to the house, which is to receive the night\r\nsoil from a closet on the floor above with the necessary quantity of dry\r\nsoil (see fig. 4). Poore, from whose book the illustration is taken,\r\nrecommends, in addition, the construction of the floor of such a pit with\r\nan inclination sufficient to carry away the urine into some gutter outside\r\nfilled with absorbent soil. The area should have suitable openings for\r\ninspection and for removal of contents, as well as for ventilation. Waring\r\nrecommended a similar system many years ago. The closet described by him\r\ndischarges into a water-tight vault in the cellar, which requires emptying\r\nonly occasionally. The contents remain inoffensive, provided sufficient\r\nthoroughly dry earth is used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Earth closet and dry catch (from Poore's\r\n\"Rural hygiene,\" scale, 1/2 inch equals 1 foot). To prevent drafts the\r\nearth closet is closed below by a hinged flap which opens and shuts\r\nautomatically by means of a counterpoise. The catch below is provided with\r\nair bricks and an air shaft leading to a ventilator.]\r\n\r\nIn cold climates, indoor closets are especially desirable to obviate\r\nthe exposure which can not be avoided when closets are out of doors.\r\nFor invalids there should be a carefully managed earth closet kept in\r\na well-aired room set apart for this purpose. In warm climates, earth\r\nclosets should be frequently cleaned. To prevent the attraction of flies\r\nand insects and the too rapid decomposition of the contents a little\r\nunslacked lime added with the earth to the excrement will be of value.\r\nThe discharges of persons suffering from typhoid-fever and bowel troubles\r\nshould be mixed with thin slacked lime[1] (milk of lime). One-half to\r\none hour after the mixing, such discharges may be put upon the soil,\r\nalways at some distance from a well or spring, a stream, or a field under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n[1] Lime, to be used for disinfection, should not be air-slacked, but kept\r\nin tightly covered receptacles to prevent this from taking place.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the use of earth and ashes has been superseded by peat dust.\r\nThe upper layer of peat is dried in the air and ground in a suitable\r\nmachine. The coarser particles are removed by sifting and used for bedding\r\nin stables. The fine portion, which has a very high absorbing power for\r\nfluids and is also capable of preventing odors, is used in dry closets.\r\nIn Germany there are at present about thirty factories engaged in the\r\npreparation of peat moss for the purposes mentioned. Its great advantages\r\nover dry earth should bring it into use in our country. (See fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nIt does not matter from a sanitary standpoint which one of the dry-earth\r\nsystems is adopted, provided the necessary attention be given to it. Every\r\nsystem which can be recommended is bad if not properly attended to. The\r\nconditions to be observed are:\r\n\r\nThe night soil should be received in water-tight receptacles.\r\n\r\nIt should be frequently removed.\r\n\r\nIt should be utilized in the garden or field by being placed under a thin\r\nlayer of soil.\r\n\r\nTo excreta from the sick, milk of lime or unslacked lime should be added\r\nbefore disposal in the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Self-acting peat dust closet. The lid is replaced\r\nby a hinged reservoir containing the peat dust. Whenever this is let down\r\na certain quantity of peat dust is discharged automatically and thrown,\r\nupon the night soil. (From Weyl's Handbuch der Hygiene. II, p. 315.)]\r\n\r\n_The water-closet._--There can be no doubt that to-day the water-carriage\r\nsystem, as it is called, or, in simpler language, the indoor water-closet,\r\nis preferred to all other contrivances. This is true for the open country\r\nas well as for villages and the suburban territories of cities. There\r\nis much to be said in favor of the present-day perfect contrivance for\r\nthe rapid removal of excreta and the exposure thereby prevented. But\r\nfor all rural inhabitants the cost should be carefully weighed before a\r\nwater-carriage system is introduced into a house, for none but the best\r\nwill answer, as all others are likely to become nuisances.\r\n\r\nThe supply of water must be sufficient to flush the water-closet\r\nthoroughly and keep all the pipes clean; the plumbing must conform to\r\nthat in vogue in cities, with its traps and ventilating pipes to prevent\r\nthe odors of the pipes from escaping into the house; and the disposal of\r\nthe large quantity of liquid sewage, the most difficult problem, must\r\nbe properly attended to or it is likely to prove more dangerous to the\r\nwater-supply than the old dry privy pits.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUID SEWAGE.\r\n\r\nThe methods available to dispose of liquid sewage in the country are\r\nwater-tight cesspools and irrigation.\r\n\r\n_Vaults._--Water-tight cesspools should be constructed of hard-burned\r\nbrick, laid in cement, and having a similar brick or a concreted bottom.\r\nThe inside and outside surfaces of the brick wall should be coated with\r\na thin layer of cement, and clay rammed in around the wall, to increase\r\nits imperviousness to water. It should be vaulted above, and topped by\r\na square or round central opening, covered with stone or iron plate.\r\nCesspools are also made of cast or wrought iron, the joints being made\r\nwater-tight. Cesspools must be ventilated by two pipes, one rising several\r\nfeet above ground, the other carried to the roof of the house, barn, or\r\nother structure near by. The current will, in most cases, tend down the\r\nshort and up the long pipe. The latter may be dispensed with and the soil\r\npipe of the house act as a flue, provided all branches are perfectly\r\ntrapped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Settling chamber and flush tank for surface\r\nand subsurface irrigation of sewage. (From Gerhard's \"The Disposal of\r\nHousehold Wastes,\" 1890.)]\r\n\r\n_Irrigation._--The disposal of sewage by irrigation is by far the best\r\nmethod now within reach. Two methods are in use, viz, surface and subsoil\r\nirrigation. The first in its most complete form consists in carrying the\r\nliquid sewage to a piece of ground set apart for the purpose and carefully\r\nunderdrained. The sewage is allowed to flow over the ground in shallow\r\nchannels. The fluid slowly disappears in the soil and enters the drains\r\nas comparatively pure water, which may be allowed to flow into a stream.\r\nFor villages this is the best means of disposing of sewage. Those who as\r\nvillage officials may be interested in this method will find plans of\r\nsuch sewage farms, together with faithful accounts of their operation and\r\nthe results obtained, in the annual report of the State Board of Health\r\nof Massachusetts for 1892, page 559, and same report for 1893, page 563.\r\nSuggestions for its application to country houses are given farther on.\r\n\r\nFor isolated rural homes, or village homes commanding a certain amount of\r\nground around the house, the liquid sewage from water-closets, the kitchen\r\nand chamber slops may be disposed of by the simple means of subsoil\r\nirrigation, first described by Mr. Moule and subsequently elaborated by\r\nColonel Waring.\r\n\r\nThe system as used at present in its most successful form consists,\r\noutside of the house, of the following parts (see fig. 6):\r\n\r\nTwo adjoining water-tight receptacles of brick. One of these receives\r\nthe sewage from the house and is intended to act as a settling chamber\r\nfor the coarser particles, paper, etc. This communicates with the second\r\nreceptacle, which receives from it the fluid sewage. This chamber is\r\ncalled the flush tank and is provided with a siphon. When the fluid has\r\nreached a certain level, the siphon is set in operation and discharges the\r\ncontents of the chamber at one time into the subsoil pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Subsurface irrigation of sewage: _a_, absorption\r\ntiles (Gerhard's \"The Disposal of Household Wastes\"); _b_ and _c_, lines\r\nof absorption tiles showing their relation to flush tank (From Waring's\r\n\"Sewerage and Land Drainage\").]\r\n\r\nFrom the second cistern a system of subsoil pipes laid over a treeless\r\npiece of ground, preferably a lawn, receives and discharges the sewage\r\ninto the ground. These pipes should consist of porous tiles, 2 inches\r\nin diameter and about 1 foot long, laid from 8 to 16 inches beneath the\r\nsurface of the ground, and with a gentle inclination of 2 or 3 inches for\r\nevery 100 feet. The tiles should have open joints not less than one-fourth\r\nof an inch wide. They are laid upon earthen gutters and the joints are\r\nprotected above by caps from being clogged with earth. The intermittent\r\ndischarge of the liquid sewage is quite essential to the successful\r\nworking of this system. If the sewage is allowed to dribble away into the\r\npipes certain portions of these will become supersaturated with fluid and\r\nothers will not receive any; the purification of the sewage in the soil is\r\nthereby rendered imperfect. The discharge of a large quantity of fluid at\r\none time, besides scouring the system of pipes, fills it more uniformly\r\nand distributes the work to all parts of the subsoil system.\r\n\r\nThe successful construction of such a plant requires the services of\r\nsomeone familiar with it, and it is therefore not necessary for me to\r\ndo more than call attention to it here as a highly recommended system\r\nfor homes, especially in villages, where the proper amount of land is\r\nprocurable and where the sewage must be disposed of in a manner both\r\ninoffensive and safe. In any case the soil of such land must be porous,\r\nnot clayey and retentive. Those who wish to familiarize themselves with\r\nthe details will find descriptions in the Sanitary Engineer for 1883, page\r\n530, by Philbrick; in \"The Disposal of Household Wastes,\" by Gerhard, and\r\nin \"Sewerage and Land Drainage,\" by Waring. The entire plant is said to\r\ncost $200 to $300, the annual expenditures for cleaning, repairs, etc.,\r\nabout $10.\r\n\r\nThe method of subsurface irrigation just described may be too complex\r\nand too expensive where land is abundant and neighboring houses at some\r\ndistance. The simpler method of surface irrigation may be resorted to by\r\nlaying out at some distance--at least 100 feet--from the house a small\r\nsewage farm where the sewage may flow in shallow trenches over the surface\r\nand slowly sink into the ground. Such an irrigation field must have the\r\nsame qualities demanded by subsurface irrigation. Its surface should have\r\nsufficient slope and the soil should be porous, not retentive. The liquid\r\nsewage, including kitchen and chamber slops, is conducted to this field in\r\na water-tight tile drain and then allowed to flow into shallow trenches.\r\nTo avoid the overloading of the soil with sewage at any one place the\r\nmain distributing trench should be so arranged that it and the irrigating\r\ntrenches branching from it may be temporarily blocked at any point to\r\ndivert the sewage into one or more different trenches every day. In winter\r\nthe warmth of the sewage will keep it in motion and the filtration will\r\ngo on although the field may be covered with snow and ice. The use of the\r\nflush tank as described above would cause a more uniform distribution of\r\nthe fluid over the field and make the filtration distinctly intermittent.\r\nThe ground between the trenches may be cultivated to increase the amount\r\nof evaporation. If conveniently situated, an orchard may be used as the\r\nirrigation field. It should be distinctly understood, however, that\r\nmarketable fruits and vegetables should not be carelessly allowed to come\r\nin contact with fresh sewage, nor should the irrigation field be near the\r\nwell unless the latter is fairly deep and tubed or tiled to the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITCHEN AND CHAMBER SLOPS.\r\n\r\nThe removal of kitchen and chamber slops is a matter which also requires\r\nproper attention, as this liquid frequently gives rise to unhealthful\r\nconditions, annoying alike to sight and smell when carelessly disposed\r\nof. The simplest way to utilize kitchen slops is to pour them upon plants\r\nabout the house in summer, in winter upon the soil, each time in another\r\nspot, so as not to supersaturate the surface layers of soil in any one\r\nplace. A means of less trouble recommended by Waring is to partly fill\r\nwith soil a barrel with leaky bottom and cover this with a layer of stable\r\nmanure to prevent the puddling of the soil. The slops filter through the\r\nsoil and leave the barrel below as a clear fluid. The barrel is emptied\r\ntwo or three times a year and the contents used for fertilizer.\r\n\r\nHouse slops may be disposed of by surface irrigation or by subsoil pipes,\r\nas already described. The originator of this method, Mr. Moule, may here\r\nbe profitably quoted as to its simplicity and success:\r\n\r\n  Where there is a garden the house slops and sink water may, in most\r\n  cases, be made of great value and removed from the house without\r\n  the least annoyance The only requirement is that there shall be a\r\n  gradual incline from the house to the garden. Let all the slops fall\r\n  into a trapped sink, the drain from which to the garden shall be of\r\n  glazed socket pipes well jointed, and emptying itself into a small\r\n  tank, 18 inches deep, about a foot wide, and of such length as may\r\n  be necessary. The surplus rain water from the roof may also enter\r\n  this. Out of this tank lay 3-inch common drain pipes, 8 feet apart\r\n  and 12 inches below the surface. Lay mortar at the top and bottom\r\n  of the joints, leaving the sides open. If these pipes are extended\r\n  to a considerable length, small tanks about 1 foot square and 18\r\n  inches deep must be sunk at about every 20 or 40 feet to allow for\r\n  subsidence. These can be emptied as often as required, and the deposit\r\n  may be either mixed with dry-earth or be dug in at once as manure. The\r\n  liquid oozes into the cultivated soil, and the result is something\r\n  fabulous. * * *\r\n\r\n  On a wall 55 feet in length and 16 feet high a vine grows. A 3-inch\r\n  pipe runs parallel with this at a distance of 6 feet from it for the\r\n  entire length. The slops flow through this pipe as above described. On\r\n  this vine year after year had been grown 400 well-ripened bunches of\r\n  grapes, some of the bunches weighing three-fourths of a pound. During\r\n  a period of four years, for a certain purpose, the supply was cut off.\r\n  To the surprise of the gardener scarcely any grapes during those years\r\n  appeared; but afterwards the supply was restored, and the consequence\r\n  was an abundant crop, the wood grow fully 16 feet, of good size and\r\n  well ripened.\r\n\r\nIn place of an indoor sink, an upright tube or hopper may be constructed\r\nout of doors in communication with the subsurface pipes into which the\r\nwaste fluids are poured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASTE AND GARBAGE.\r\n\r\nThe attractiveness of a rural home depends largely upon the promptness\r\nwith which all kinds of waste material are disposed of. The abundance\r\nof space around the house is a great temptation for the members of the\r\nhousehold to use it as a place for storing rubbish and useless, worn-out\r\nthings. Sifted ashes are easily utilized in earth closets and upon walks\r\nand roads, to make them compact and firm. Other articles of no use,\r\nsuch as broken crockery, bottles, tin cans, etc., can be thrown into\r\ndepressions and gullies and covered over with earth, or else buried in\r\ntrenches where subsoil drainage is desirable. The removal of rubbish is a\r\nvery fruitful theme and might be dealt with at length. Its importance as\r\nrelated to health and disease is a subordinate one, and the reformer must\r\nappeal to the love of order, propriety, and beauty in and around the home\r\nin order to make an impression.\r\n\r\nGarbage is of much less annoyance in the country than in the city, where\r\nits collection and destruction is a great expense, and is frequently very\r\nunsatisfactorily done. In the country, the household garbage is fed to the\r\nswine and poultry, and is in this way profitably used. There are, however,\r\nhomes where garbage must be taken care of in other ways. It may be buried\r\nin the garden or else burned in the kitchen range. Recently a device has\r\nbeen patented which enables the housekeeper to place the garbage in a\r\nsection of the smoke pipe of the range, where it dries out rapidly, burns,\r\nand leaves only a little charcoal behind, which may be used for fuel next\r\nday. This device has been well recommended by sanitarians (see fig. 8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Garbage cremator. The garbage is placed in the\r\nperforated frame. The latter is pushed into the smoke pipe, where the\r\ngarbage becomes slowly carbonized.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF DRINKING; WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next subject to claim our attention is the protection of the sources\r\nof drinking water. In the country water is, as a rule, obtained from wells\r\nand springs. The important bearing upon well water of soil purity demands\r\na few explanatory remarks concerning the origin of well water. Wells\r\nare excavations made into the ground to a variable depth until water is\r\nreached. This water is denominated ground or subsoil water. Its origin\r\nmay be better understood if, for the moment, we conceive the surface of\r\nthe earth as more or less irregular and entirely impervious to water. The\r\nrain would collect on this surface and form lakes, ponds, and streams,\r\naccording to the configuration of the surface. If, now, we conceive this\r\nsurface covered with sand or other porous earth to a greater or lesser\r\nheight, and the top of this be considered the earth's actual surface, the\r\nwater will remain in the same position, but it will be buried within and\r\nfill the pores of the overlying soil as subterranean lakes, ponds, and\r\nstreams. In digging a well we remove this porous layer of earth until we\r\nreach these subterranean streams or reservoirs of ground-water. If the\r\nabove description be thoroughly understood, the condition under which well\r\nwater may be obtained at different depths will become intelligible, and\r\nit will also appear plain why ground-water may flow as any surface stream\r\nand pick up on its way various substances which have percolated into the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhen the bed of porous soil overlying the impervious layers is very deep,\r\nwells will have to be dug down to a considerable depth to reach the\r\nsurface of the ground-water. Where this layer of pervious earth is of\r\nslight thickness wells will be shallow, and the ground-water may appear on\r\nthe bottom of gullies, trenches, and wherever the porous layer has been\r\ndug or washed away.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the ground-water depends on the inclination or slope of\r\nthe impervious strata, and has been observed to be quite rapid in some\r\ninstances. By adding common salt to the water in a well its detection\r\nin other wells at a short distance has been found a guide in the\r\ndetermination of the rapidity and direction of the underground current.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground-water resting on the uppermost impervious layers is near\r\nthe surface, and therefore not safe or fit to use as drinking water,\r\nit may be possible by digging below this layer to find another porous\r\nbed containing water. This source will, in general, be much purer since\r\nit is less exposed to pollution from above, and since the water has to\r\ntravel longer distances underground. Such a deep supply must, however, be\r\nprotected from the superficial supply by a water-tight wall extending to\r\nthe surface of the deep supply, otherwise the water from the upper layers\r\nwill simply drain into the well.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYS OF CONTAMINATION.\r\n\r\nWells are exposed to contamination in two ways. The surface water from\r\nrain, house slops, and barnyard drainage may find its way into the well at\r\nor near the surface of the ground. Or the ground-water stream supplying\r\nthe well with water may in its subterranean movements encounter cesspools\r\nor seepings from cesspools, and carry with it soluble and suspended\r\nparticles, some of which may enter the well. There can be no doubt that\r\na large percentage of the wells are exposed to contamination with refuse\r\nmatter in the manner described; and it now remains to gauge the danger\r\nto health and life which may be carried in the contaminating substance.\r\nThe danger of typhoid-fever bacteria entering the water has already been\r\nmentioned. These may be washed in from the surface or they may pass from\r\ncesspools near by through fissures in the ground, passages dug by rats,\r\netc. Whether such bacteria can pass through the pores of a compact,\r\nunbroken soil from a cesspool to a well near it is a matter not fully\r\nsettled. Since, however, the actual condition of the deeper layers of the\r\nsoil between cesspool and well can not be known, it becomes imperative\r\nto prevent all pollution of the ground-water current supplying wells by\r\neither abolishing the cesspools or else placing them at a considerable\r\ndistance from all sources of water.\r\n\r\nBeside typhoid-fever bacteria, those organisms which cause digestive\r\ndisturbances, and severer troubles, such as diarrhea, dysentery, and\r\npossibly other unknown diseases, may be carried into well water. During\r\ncholera epidemics, polluted wells might form centers of infection. Eggs of\r\nanimal parasites may be washed in from the surface. Again, the barnyard\r\nmanure, representing the mixed excrement of various animals, may under\r\ncertain conditions be bearers of disease germs, and such excrement\r\nshould, under no conditions, be looked upon as entirely harmless to human\r\nbeings.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] It is probable that the filth which gets into cow's milk and which\r\nappears to be mainly excrement of cows is largely responsible for the\r\nsevere summer diseases of infants fed on cow's milk.\r\n\r\nBesides the protection of the ground-water near the well from pollution\r\nemanating from cesspools, etc., the surface of the ground about the well\r\nshould be kept free from manure, slops, and other waste water; hence\r\nthe well should not be dug under or close by the house,[3] nor should\r\nit be located in the barnyard, where the ground is usually saturated\r\nwith manure. It should be surrounded by turf, and not by richly manured,\r\ncultivated, or irrigated soil. The ground immediately around it should\r\nslope gently away from it and be paved if possible. The waste water from\r\nthe well should not be allowed to soak into the ground, but should be\r\ncollected in water-tight receptacles or else conducted at least 25 feet\r\naway in open or closed channels which are water-tight.\r\n\r\n[3] The water may be carried into the kitchen by running the pipe from the\r\nwell, horizontally, under ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF WELLS.\r\n\r\nThe well itself must be so constructed that impurities can not get into\r\nit from above or from the sides. If water can soak into it after passing\r\nthrough a few feet of soil only, it can not be regarded as secure from\r\npollution. To prevent this, the well may be provided with a water-tight\r\nwall built of hard-burned brick and cement down to the water level. The\r\noutside surface of this wall should be covered with a thin layer of\r\ncement, and clay pounded and puddled in around it. Or, tile may be used\r\nto line the well and the joints made water-tight with cement down to the\r\nwater level. Driven wells, i. e., wells constructed of iron tubing driven\r\ninto the ground, are, perhaps, the safest where the quantity of water\r\nneeded is not large and where other conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nThese different devices are all designed to keep water near the surface\r\nof the soil from percolating into the well. To keep impurities from\r\nentering the well directly from the top considerable care is necessary.\r\nSuch impurities are likely to prove the most dangerous because there is\r\nno earth niter to hold them back and destroy them before they can reach\r\nthe water. Adequate protection above may be provided in several ways.\r\nThe sides of the tiled wells should project above the surface and be\r\nsecurely covered with a water-tight lid. The ordinary well should also\r\nhave its sides project above the surface and a water-tight cover of heavy\r\nplanks provided, which should not be disturbed excepting for repairing or\r\ncleansing the well. Under no circumstances should objects be let down into\r\nthe well to cool. A still better method of protecting the water from above\r\nis to have the lining wall of the well end 3 feet below the surface of the\r\nground and to be topped there with a vaulted roof, closed in the center\r\nwith a removable iron or stone plate. The top should be covered with 12\r\ninches of clay or loam; above this there should be a layer of sand, and\r\nlastly a pavement sloping away in all directions.\r\n\r\nToo much care can not be bestowed upon the household well. It should\r\nbe guarded jealously and all means applied to put the water above any\r\nsuspicion of being impure. This is especially true in dairies where well\r\nwater is used in cleaning the milk cans, and where steam and boiling water\r\nhave not yet found their way for this end. Polluted wells in such houses\r\nnot only endanger the health of the inmates but that of a more or less\r\nnumerous body of city customers.\r\n\r\nIn those regions where rain water is the only safe drinking water, the\r\nsame care is necessary to protect the stored supply from contamination,\r\nand no suggestions beyond those already given are necessary here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages it has been the aim of the writer to give a few\r\nfacts and supply a certain number of ideas which, in the mind of any\r\nperson who has thoroughly understood them and who thinks for himself,\r\nmay be safely left to ripen into schemes adapted to his own wants and\r\nsurroundings. How many resources a man armed with correct views may find\r\nin the simplest appliances the reader may judge for himself by consulting\r\nChapters IX, X, and XI of Dr. Vivian Poore's very interesting volume on\r\nrural hygiene. Whether the means for utilizing household wastes there\r\ndescribed and adopted by him would be adequate outside of a limited\r\nterritory of our own country, I am not prepared to state. For the same\r\nreason no definite suggestions can be made in these pages, owing to the\r\nwide diversity in the climatic and other conditions obtaining over the\r\nvast territory of our country. The writer has, furthermore, omitted all\r\nstatements of detail which properly belong to the sanitary engineer. The\r\nworks referred to will, however, supply those more directly interested\r\nwith the facts and figures desired.\r\n\r\nThe principles to be kept in the foreground are the disposal of sewage\r\nin the superficial layers of the soil in not too great quantity, the\r\ndisinfection of the stools of the sick with lime before such disposition\r\nis made, the digging of wells in places kept permanently in grass and at\r\nsome distance from barnyards, and, above all, their thorough protection\r\nfrom contamination from the surface and from the soil immediately below\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nIn every community there are public-spirited citizens who could do much\r\ngood by taking hold of the simplest and safest methods of disposing of\r\nsewage and refuse, putting them into practice, and showing the rest of\r\nthe community just what good can be accomplished and what harm avoided\r\nby a little continuous attention to sanitary matters. In this way many\r\nmay be led to undertake improvements who, with no definite knowledge of\r\nthe expense involved and with misgivings as to the final success of the\r\nundertaking, would otherwise hesitate to make a beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS' BULLETINS.\r\n\r\nThese bulletins fire sent free of charge to any address upon application\r\nto the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.
