Unmeasured depths\r\nof rock underlie the prairies, hills, and valleys, and in some parts of\r\nthe state are exposed in outcrops, canyons, and river valleys. Boulders\r\nand gravel brought in by the glaciers thousands of years ago are strewn\r\nover many parts of the state.\r\n\r\nThese resources are of great value. Besides the rich agriculture based\r\non the rock-derived soil, much of our industry, manufacturing, and\r\ntransportation is dependent on rock and mineral materials. Every county\r\nin Illinois possesses some rocks and minerals that either are being used\r\nor have potential future value.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois State Geological Survey several years ago began to prepare\r\nsets of typical rocks and minerals of Illinois for use by the schools\r\nand other educational groups in Illinois. This booklet is designed to\r\nfurnish a brief geological background and explanation of these common\r\nIllinois rocks and minerals. It also should be useful to the student or\r\namateur interested in making his own collection.\r\n\r\nEven though Illinois has no mountain ranges or deep canyons, the geology\r\nof the state has many complexities. In fact, the very flatness of our\r\ntopography is a complicating factor because in order to study the\r\ngeology at many places in the state it is necessary to use information\r\nfrom mines and descriptions (logs) and samples (cores) of the rock\r\npenetrated during drilling of deep wells. There are also geophysical\r\nmethods of learning something about the rocks beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.—Geologic map of Illinois.]\r\n\r\n  CAMBRIAN\r\n  ORDOVICIAN\r\n  ORDOVICIAN-SILURIAN\r\n  ORDOVICIAN-SILURIAN UNDER DRIFT\r\n  DEVONIAN-MISSISSIPPIAN\r\n  PENNSYLVANIAN UNDER DRIFT\r\n  CRETACEOUS-TERTIARY\r\n  KEY\r\n    Wisconsin glacial drift\r\n    Illinoian glacial drift\r\n    Pennsylvanian boundary\r\n\r\nThe complexity of Illinois geology is not produced by the upturning and\r\nsharp folding of rock layers such as can be seen in the Rocky Mountains,\r\nbut rather by the changes in composition, thickness, and character of\r\nthe rock layers that are only gently warped or relatively flat. At\r\nseveral places in the state, especially in the southern part, faults, or\r\nbreaks, in the rock layers do occur, but over much of our area this is\r\nnot common.\r\n\r\nThe presence of usable minerals at considerable depth is known at many\r\nplaces; coal is mined from depths greater than 800 feet, and oil is\r\nproduced from saturated rock layers, called pay zones, several thousand\r\nfeet below the surface. Lead and zinc ores, fluorspar, silica sand,\r\nlimestone, sand, gravel, clay, and shale are all produced at shallower\r\ndepths. However, the student can see only those rocks and minerals that\r\nare to be found at or near the surface. For that reason the following\r\nparagraphs describing their geologic occurrence deal only with surface\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the major geologic divisions of our rocks is called the\r\nPleistocene, which is the scientific name for the “Ice Age” deposits.\r\nDuring this relatively recent period of geologic time, which began about\r\na million years ago, glaciers flowed southward from Canada and spread a\r\nlayer of “glacial drift” over all of the state except the northwest\r\ncorner, the southwest edge of the state along the Mississippi River, and\r\nextreme southern Illinois (fig. 1).\r\n\r\nMost of the glacial deposits that we see were formed by the last two of\r\nthe four major periods of glacial advance, the Illinoian and the\r\nWisconsin. The Illinoian was the most extensive, reaching as far south\r\nas Carbondale and Harrisburg. The Wisconsin, so called because its\r\ndeposits are so widely spread in that state, reached only to Mattoon and\r\nPeoria.\r\n\r\nThe glacial drift is the youngest and uppermost of the divisions of the\r\nrock column (fig. 2). Within the drift can be found the widest diversity\r\nof rock and mineral types—quartzite, schist, and other metamorphic\r\nrocks; granite, gabbro, and other igneous rocks; and of course the\r\nsedimentary rocks, limestone, dolomite, sandstone, shale, and even\r\npieces of coal, which occur in bedded layers of the older rocks in\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nSand and gravel were carried and deposited by flowing streams before,\r\nduring, and after glaciation, but the major deposits were made while the\r\nglaciers were melting. They contain a wide variety of rock and mineral\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2—Diagram of layers of rocks in Illinois.]\r\n\r\n Era                                 General Types of Rocks\r\n    Period or System and Thickness\r\n       Epoch\r\n\r\n CENOZOIC “Recent Life”\r\n Age of Mammals\r\n    Quaternary\r\n    0-500′\r\n       Pleistocene or Glacial Age\r\n                        Recent—alluvium in river valleys\r\n                        Glacial till, glacial outwash, gravel, sand,\r\n                        silt lake deposits of clay and silt, loess and\r\n                        sand dunes; covers nearly all of state except\r\n                        northwest corner and southern tip\r\n    Tertiary\r\n    0-500′\r\n       Pliocene         Chert gravel; present in northern, southern, and\r\n                        western Illinois\r\n       Eocene           Mostly micaceous sand with some silt and clay;\r\n                        present only in southern Illinois\r\n       Paleocene        Mostly clay, little sand; present only in\r\n                        southern Illinois\r\n MESOZOIC “Middle Life”\r\n Age of Reptiles\r\n    Cretaceous          Mostly sand, some thin beds of clay and,\r\n    0-300′              locally, gravel; present only in southern\r\n                        Illinois\r\n PALEOZOIC “Ancient Life”\r\n Age of Amphibians and Early Plants\r\n    Pennsylvanian       Largely shale and sandstone with beds of coal,\r\n    0-3,000′            limestone, and clay\r\n    (“Coal Measures”)\r\n    Mississippian       Black and gray shale at base; middle zone of\r\n    0-3,500′            thick limestone that grades to siltstone, chert,\r\n                        and shale; upper zone of interbedded sandstone,\r\n                        shale and limestone\r\n    Age of Fishes\r\n    Devonian            Thick limestone, minor sandstones and shales;\r\n    0-1,500′            largely chert and cherty limestone in southern\r\n                        Illinois\r\n    Age of Invertebrates\r\n    Silurian            Principally dolomite and limestone\r\n    0-1,000′\r\n    Ordovician          Largely dolomite and limestone but contains\r\n    500-2,000′          sandstone, shale, and siltstone formations\r\n    Cambrian            Chiefly sandstones with some dolomite and shale;\r\n    1,500-3,000′        exposed only in small areas in north-central\r\n                        Illinois\r\n ARCHEOZOIC and PROTEROZOIC\r\n                        Igneous and metamorphic rocks; known in Illinois\r\n                        only from deep wells\r\n\r\nAs shown by the diagrammatic rock column (fig. 2), rocks placed in the\r\ndivisions called early Cenozoic and Mesozoic are next in age to the\r\nPleistocene. The map (fig. 1) shows that the Cenozoic and Mesozoic rocks\r\noccur only in the extreme southern tip of Illinois because only that\r\npart of Illinois was covered by a northward extension of the forerunner\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico in which the deposits of sand, gravel, and clay\r\nwere laid down.\r\n\r\nThe next older division of Illinois rocks is called Pennsylvanian—or\r\n“Coal Measures”—because during the last century they were first\r\nextensively described by geologists working in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanian is one of our most important groups of rock strata\r\nbecause it contains all of our minable coal beds, as well as important\r\ndeposits of limestone, shale, clay, sandstone, and some oil and gas. The\r\nPennsylvanian rocks are very widespread in Illinois, occurring under the\r\nglacial drift from depths of a few feet to several hundred feet\r\nthroughout about two-thirds of the glaciated area (fig. 1).\r\n\r\nNext below the Pennsylvanian are the Mississippian rocks. We in Illinois\r\nare particularly interested in this division of rocks because they take\r\ntheir name from the excellent exposures along the Mississippi River\r\nvalley in western Illinois, southeastern Iowa, and eastern Missouri.\r\nThey are composed of extensive beds of limestone and cherty limestone,\r\nsandstone, and shale.\r\n\r\nMississippian rocks are of great economic importance in the structural\r\narea known as the Illinois Basin, where they are the most important oil\r\nproducing rocks. They also contain our fluorspar deposits and along the\r\nvalley bluffs are an excellent source of limestone for quarrying.\r\n\r\nRocks older than the Mississippian—except for small areas along the\r\nMississippi and Illinois River valleys—are found at the surface only in\r\nthe northern quarter of the state and locally in Hardin County near the\r\nsouthern tip of the state. They are nonetheless economically important\r\nbecause from these older rocks are produced lead and zinc, some oil and\r\ngas, silica sand, limestone, dolomite, and shale.\r\n\r\nOn the generalized rock column (fig. 2) these older rocks are grouped\r\ninto two units. The uppermost contains the Devonian and Silurian and the\r\nlower contains the Ordovician and Cambrian. In general they include\r\ndolomite, limestone, and shale, with sandstone at several places,\r\nespecially in the lower unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DESCRIPTION OF ROCKS AND MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terms mineral and rock are often confused. They are frequently used\r\ntogether and the materials they describe are closely related. In\r\ngeneral, a mineral is a naturally occurring chemical element or compound\r\nformed by inorganic processes, whereas a rock is a mixture of particles\r\nor grains of several minerals.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we refer to mineral resources or industrial minerals, we\r\ngenerally include materials that are technically rocks—such as\r\nlimestone, dolomite, shale—and also coal and oil that are in fact\r\norganic substances. On the other hand, we include in the rock category\r\nhigh purity sandstone that is composed almost entirely of one mineral\r\n(quartz) and high purity limestone that is composed largely of the\r\nmineral calcite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nA few minerals are composed of only one element, such as diamond\r\n(carbon) and native copper, but most minerals are chemical compounds\r\nthat contain several elements.\r\n\r\nMost minerals grow into distinctive shapes if they are free to grow. A\r\nfamiliar example is the formation of salt crystals that grow on a saucer\r\nof evaporating salt water. The distinctive shapes of crystals are called\r\ntheir habits, and the flat surfaces that develop are called crystal\r\nfaces, the angles of which may be used to identify the mineral.\r\n\r\nThe individual atoms of a crystal always arrange themselves in the same\r\nway, so that each mineral breaks characteristically. Some minerals break\r\nmore easily in particular directions and present a flat, smooth surface.\r\nThis characteristic is called cleavage and the cleavage surfaces,\r\nalthough sometimes confused with crystal faces, may be useful for\r\nidentifying a particular mineral. The manner in which a mineral breaks\r\nwhen the broken surface does not include cleavage surfaces is called its\r\nfracture, and this too may give a clue to the identification of the\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\nThere are other physical features useful in identifying minerals. Some\r\nof them, such as color, are quite obvious. The color of the powder left\r\nwhen a mineral is scraped on a rough, white surface, such as unglazed\r\nporcelain or tile, is called streak. Luster refers to the brightness of\r\nlight reflected from the mineral’s surface. Transparency and\r\ntranslucency refer to the mineral’s ability to transmit light, and\r\ntenacity is a measure of its toughness.\r\n\r\nTwo special physical characteristics of minerals are important to their\r\nidentification—specific gravity and hardness. Specific gravity simply\r\nmeans the ratio of the weight of the mineral to an equivalent volume of\r\nwater. For example, if a mineral has a specific gravity of 4, then a\r\ncubic inch of the mineral weighs as much as 4 cubic inches of water.\r\n\r\nHardness is measured by the ability of one mineral to scratch another,\r\nand a set of ten standard minerals has been selected for determining\r\nthis characteristic. The listing below, from soft to hard, is known as\r\nMohs scale.\r\n\r\n  1—Talc\r\n  2—Gypsum\r\n  3—Calcite\r\n  4—Fluorite\r\n  5—Apatite\r\n  6—Orthoclase\r\n  7—Quartz\r\n  8—Topaz\r\n  9—Corundum\r\n  10—Diamond\r\n\r\nA rough measure of hardness can be made by using handy objects. Your\r\nfingernail has a hardness ranging from 2 to 3, a penny is a little\r\nharder than 3, window glass ranges from less than 5 to approximately 6\r\nin hardness, and a knife blade is generally in the range of 5 to 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks, being mixtures of minerals, are more complex than minerals and\r\nare therefore classified in a more complicated way. The broadest\r\ngrouping of rocks is based on the origin of the rock rather than on the\r\nminerals that compose it. In this scheme all rocks are divided into\r\nthree general groups, igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.\r\n\r\nThe igneous rocks are mentioned first because they are produced directly\r\nfrom hot liquids that come from deep within the earth. These hot liquids\r\nare essentially molten rock and are called magmas. When they cool, the\r\nelements of the individual minerals come together and crystallize, as\r\nwater crystallizes into ice on a winter day.\r\n\r\nDifferent minerals crystallize, or “freeze”, at different temperatures\r\nso that if the magma cools slowly some individual grains have\r\nopportunity to grow larger than others. If the magma cools quickly, as\r\ndoes lava or basalt, the separate mineral grains will be small. Igneous\r\nrocks are classified on the basis of the size and arrangement of the\r\nindividual crystals and the kinds of minerals present.\r\n\r\nThe glacial drift in Illinois contains many pieces of igneous and\r\nmetamorphic rocks, but most of the rocks native to Illinois are\r\nsedimentary.\r\n\r\nSome sedimentary rocks are made up of weathered fragments of other rocks\r\nthat have been moved by rivers, waves, winds, or glaciers. These\r\nsediments have been deposited and later compacted or cemented by the\r\nmineral matter carried in water moving through them. Such sedimentary\r\nrocks are called clastic (meaning broken pieces) rocks, as opposed to\r\nthose formed by chemical precipitation from water and those that consist\r\nof fossil remains.\r\n\r\nClastic sedimentary rocks are classified first on the basis of the size\r\nof the grains of gravel, sand, silt, and clay of which they are\r\ncomposed; on the type of deposition, such as glacial drift and\r\nwind-blown silt or loess, that produced them; and then on the basis of\r\ntheir mineral composition. Rocks such as gypsum and some of our\r\nlimestones were formed by chemical precipitation from sea water.\r\n\r\nMetamorphic rock literally means rock that has changed form. The change\r\nof form has been caused by heat and pressures that occur below the\r\nsurface of the earth or by heat from upward moving hot magmas or melted\r\nrocks. Examples of metamorphic rocks are found in Illinois as boulders\r\nand pebbles in the glacial drift.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the rocks and minerals represented by specimens in the\r\nGeological Survey’s rock and mineral sets follow. The numbers preceding\r\nthe descriptions correspond to the numbers on the specimens in the sets.\r\n\r\nAlthough the set includes the rocks and minerals that are most commonly\r\nfound in Illinois, many others can be collected. For that reason,\r\nfollowing the descriptions is a key for identifying other Illinois\r\nminerals and rocks.\r\n\r\nAs a further aid to the beginner and the amateur, a list of equipment\r\nuseful in making a rock and mineral collection is given at the end of\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GRANITE (1)\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANITE is one of the most widespread intrusive (originating deep within\r\nthe earth) igneous rocks. It consists chiefly of feldspar and quartz\r\nwith small amounts of biotite, muscovite, or hornblende. Most granite is\r\nlight colored, but it can be white, gray, yellow, pink, or deep red. The\r\ntexture ranges from medium grained to coarse grained.\r\n\r\nGranite pebbles or boulders are the most common igneous rocks found in\r\nglacial deposits in Illinois. They are not native to the state but were\r\nbrought here by the great ice sheets or glaciers that advanced from\r\nsouthern Canada to cover much of northern United States during\r\nPleistocene time.\r\n\r\nNative granitic rock probably lies very deep beneath the entire state.\r\nIt has been found in deep oil-test drillings along the western and\r\nnorthern margins of Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GABBRO (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nGABBRO is another intrusive igneous rock, but it is heavier and darker\r\nthan granite. It is composed mainly of feldspar and dark iron-bearing\r\nminerals that give the rock a dark color. It is coarse grained and\r\ncontains little or no quartz.\r\n\r\nMineral crystals of gabbro are especially tightly interlocked, making\r\nthe rock very difficult to break. Weathered gabbro is a rusty color on\r\nthe surface, because the iron in gabbro changes color just as a piece of\r\nmetallic iron becomes coated with rust when left out of doors.\r\n\r\nLike other igneous rocks found near the surface in Illinois, gabbro was\r\ncarried into Illinois by the glaciers and deposited as glacial debris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PORPHYRY (3)\r\n\r\n\r\nPORPHYRY is an igneous rock identified by its texture rather than its\r\nmineral content, which is variable. Distinct crystals (phenocrysts) of\r\nminerals are embedded in a matrix of fine-grained rock. The phenocrysts\r\nformed before the main mass of the rock hardened.\r\n\r\nAny igneous rock may have a porphyritic variety, such as granite\r\nporphyry and rhyolite porphyry, although porphyries are most likely to\r\nform in association with fine-grained igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nPorphyry is found in Illinois only in glacial drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BASALT (4)\r\n\r\n\r\nBASALT is the most widely distributed volcanic rock. Pyroxene, feldspar,\r\nmagnetite (an iron ore), and in some instances olivine, biotite, and\r\nhornblende, compose this rock. The dark green, gray, or black color is\r\ndue to the dark-colored minerals that make up much of the rock. The\r\nminerals in basalt are fine grained and are packed closely together.\r\nPhenocrysts of olivine, pyroxene, and hornblende may be present. Basalt\r\nis easily identified by its color and fine-grained texture.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers brought basalt into Illinois along with other igneous\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PERIDOTITE (5)\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIDOTITE is the only igneous rock native to Illinois that crops out at\r\nthe surface. It is found as dikes (irregular veins) or sills (thin\r\nsheets) that were formed when molten rock from deeper in the earth\r\nintruded into cracks and fissures in the bedrock of southeastern\r\nIllinois (Hardin, Pope, Gallatin, and Saline Counties). Peridotite\r\npebbles and boulders also may be found in the glacial drift.\r\n\r\nPeridotite ranges from very fine grained to medium grained and has an\r\neven texture. It is dark gray to greenish gray, depending on the\r\nminerals present. In general it is composed of olivine, hornblende,\r\npyroxene, and mica, with little or no feldspar or quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GNEISS AND SCHIST (6)\r\n\r\n\r\nGNEISS is a metamorphic rock composed of roughly parallel bands of\r\nminerals. It is medium grained to coarse grained and is generally light\r\nin color. The names given to gneiss emphasize a distinctive texture or\r\nmineral or indicate composition. For example, biotite gneiss emphasizes\r\na mineral, and granite gneiss indicates the composition of the rock.\r\n\r\nSCHIST is much like gneiss but is fine grained and has a thinly layered\r\nstructure that makes the rock break with a wavy surface. Some common\r\ntypes of schistose rocks are talc schist, chlorite schist, and\r\nhornblende schist. As the names indicate, they are characterized by\r\ntheir dominant mineral. Mica schist may be formed by the metamorphism of\r\neither sedimentary or igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nGneiss and schist are not native to Illinois but are found in the\r\nglacial drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CONGLOMERATE (7)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGLOMERATE is a sedimentary rock made up of pebbles or other rock\r\nfragments cemented in a background or matrix of finer material,\r\ngenerally silica, calcium carbonate, clay, iron oxide, or a mixture of\r\nthese substances. The rounded rock fragments have been worn by being\r\nrolled in streams and along beaches.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nIf the pebbles embedded in the matrix are sharp and angular, freshly\r\nbroken and not worn, the rock is called breccia and is generally found\r\nnear the place where the fragments originated. Conglomerate or breccia\r\nmay be made up of any type of rock or mineral, most commonly durable\r\nmaterial such as chert, quartz, quartzite, granite, and gneiss.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois, conglomerates commonly are found at the base of sandstone\r\nformations and as beds in the lower “Coal Measures.” They also are found\r\nin some gravel deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SANDSTONE (8)\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDSTONE is a clastic sedimentary rock consisting of sand-sized grains\r\n(one sixty-fourth to one-sixteenth inch in diameter) held together by a\r\ncementing material. As sandstones become finer grained they grade into\r\nsiltstones; as they become coarser grained they grade into conglomerate.\r\nThe shape of sand grains in sandstones ranges from rounded to angular.\r\n\r\nQuartz is the dominant mineral in sandstone, but other rock grains and\r\nmineral grains (especially chalcedony, feldspar, muscovite, hornblende,\r\nmagnetite, or garnet) generally are present.\r\n\r\nSandstones are commonly cemented by carbonates, silica, iron oxides, or\r\nclays. Most sandstones are a shade of gray or brown, but the color may\r\nvary from gray or white to yellow, brown, or red. The color probably\r\ndepends on the type of cement, the amount of organic material present,\r\nand the amount and degree of oxidation of iron in the rock.\r\n\r\nDurability of sandstones depends largely on the character of the cement.\r\nSome sandstones crumble easily, but others, especially those cemented by\r\niron oxides or silica, are tough and durable. Sandstones break around\r\nthe grains, giving the broken surface a granular appearance.\r\n\r\nSandstone crops out in many places throughout much of the state. In\r\nLaSalle and Ogle Counties, large tonnages of sand are mined from the St.\r\nPeter Sandstone and sold for a variety of uses, including abrasive sand,\r\nmolding sand, and sand for making glass. In extreme southern Illinois\r\nattractively colored sandstones have been quarried for building stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               QUARTZITE (9)\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARTZITE is a metamorphic rock that originally was quartz sandstone.\r\nQuartzites are produced by intense heat and/or pressure, probably aided\r\nby hot silica-bearing solutions. The quartz grains may be so closely\r\ninterlocked that individual grains are no longer recognizable. The rock\r\nfractures conchoidally through both the grains and cement, so the broken\r\nsurface, unlike that of sandstone, is smooth and may even be glassy like\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\nColor depends upon the amount and kind of impurities present. A\r\nquartzite that is all quartz is white or gray, but iron or other\r\nelements may change the color to shades of purple, yellow, brown, or\r\nred. Quartzite is a very resistant, hard rock and cannot be scratched by\r\na knife.\r\n\r\nQuartzite is abundant as boulders and pebbles in glacial drift of\r\nIllinois, having been brought into the state during the “Ice Age.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 SHALE (10)\r\n\r\n\r\nSHALE is a common and important sedimentary rock composed of compacted\r\nclay or mud. It is so fine grained that the minerals forming it\r\ngenerally cannot be identified without the aid of X-ray.\r\n\r\nShales are composed mainly of clay minerals but, like other sedimentary\r\nrocks, generally include other minerals. Shales containing calcium\r\ncarbonate are called calcareous shales. Most shales contain silt or sand\r\nparticles; if silt or sand is present in large quantity, the rock is\r\ncalled silty shale or sandy shale. If mica minerals are present in\r\nquantity in a shale it is called micaceous shale.\r\n\r\nThe particles of most clay minerals are thin and flat and overlap each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nShales have a wide range of colors but most of those in Illinois are\r\ngray. A gray, black, or blue-gray color is caused by organic matter in\r\nthe shale; shades of red, brown, yellow, or green are caused by iron\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nShale is widely distributed in Illinois, especially in “Coal Measures”\r\nrocks, and is used in manufacturing bricks, drain tile, building tile,\r\nand lightweight aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CLAY (11)\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAY is an unconsolidated rock made up of a group of hydrous aluminum\r\nsilicate minerals, of which chlorite, montmorillonite, kaolinite, and\r\nillite are the most abundant. These minerals are formed by the\r\nweathering or alteration of other rocks and minerals.\r\n\r\nClays are very fine grained and their minerals have tiny, flat crystals\r\nthat can be distinguished from each other only by laboratory methods.\r\nAlthough clays may appear to be similar, their compositions vary\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\nSome clays are white, but most are colored by iron compounds and organic\r\nmatter. Wet clays have an earthy odor and generally are slick and\r\nplastic, but dry clays are relatively hard and are greasy to the touch.\r\n\r\nClays are abundant in Illinois, especially in soils, in shales, and as\r\nclay deposits. In Illinois the underclays that occur beneath coal beds\r\nare particularly well suited to the manufacture of bricks, pottery,\r\nstoneware, and drain tile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LIMESTONE (12)\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMESTONE is a sedimentary rock composed of particles of calcite\r\n(calcium carbonate). The crystals may range from fine to coarse. Many\r\nlimestones contain other minerals, such as chert, clay, or sand, and in\r\nsome places they grade into dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate).\r\n\r\nMany limestones are white or gray. Yellow or brown shades are caused by\r\niron oxide impurities and dark gray to black colors by organic matter.\r\n\r\nLimestones form in various ways. Some are deposited when calcium\r\ncarbonate precipitates from solution; others are formed when the shells\r\nor skeletons of organisms such as brachiopods, clams, and corals\r\naccumulate on a sea floor. If such fossils are very abundant, the rock\r\nis called fossiliferous limestone. Limestone composed of tiny, rounded\r\nconcretions is called oolite or oolitic limestone.\r\n\r\nLimestone effervesces freely in dilute hydrochloric acid, but dolomite\r\nmust be powdered before it will effervesce. In nature, limestones may be\r\ndissolved by percolating water containing weak acid (such as carbonic\r\nacid, composed of water and carbon dioxide). At many places in southern\r\nand southwestern Illinois such solution of limestones has produced caves\r\nand caverns.\r\n\r\nLimestone outcrops are abundant in Illinois, especially along the bluffs\r\nof the Mississippi, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers.\r\n\r\nLimestone has many uses. It is used for building stone, road surfacing,\r\nrailroad ballast, in the manufacture of portland cement, and, if of high\r\npurity, for making lime and chemicals and as a flux in smelting metals.\r\nIt also is used, as agricultural limestone, to add calcium to the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PEAT (13)\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAT is produced by the partial decomposition of plants that accumulate,\r\nwith varying amounts of mineral matter, in old ponds, swamps, and lakes,\r\nand in abandoned channels in valley bottoms along many rivers and\r\nstreams. Peat may be an early stage in the formation of coal.\r\n\r\nPeat ranges from light to dark brown, the color, decomposition, and\r\ncompaction increasing with depth in the deposit. Some of the plant\r\nremains are clearly distinguishable and appear as fibrous fragments held\r\ntogether by the fine peat particles. The type of peat common in Illinois\r\nhas a high water content. Before it is dried it is soft and spongy to\r\nthe touch; upon drying, it loses much water and becomes harder.\r\n\r\nPeat is used as a fuel in some parts of the world, but its heating value\r\nis low compared to that of coal. It burns with a long flame and leaves a\r\ngreat deal of ash because of the silt and sand that were buried with the\r\nvegetation. Peat and peat moss are used chiefly as an absorbent, as\r\nstable litter, as insulating and packing material, and by gardeners to\r\nincrease the water-holding capacity of soils.\r\n\r\nPeat is found in many places in Illinois but the largest deposits are in\r\nnortheastern Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 COAL (14)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL, an organic stratified rock, is formed from accumulated plant\r\nmaterial and partially decayed plants that were buried during the “Coal\r\nMeasures” period in Illinois more than 200 million years ago.\r\n\r\nSediments deposited over the peat-like organic material compacted it.\r\nChemical changes gradually took place and resulted in the loss of water\r\nand gases, leaving a higher percentage of carbon than the original\r\nmaterial contained.\r\n\r\nThe amount of such change that has taken place determines the rank of\r\nthe coal. The lowest ranks are called lignite, the intermediate group is\r\ncalled bituminous (soft) coal, and coals of the highest rank, with the\r\nhighest carbon content, are called anthracite (hard coal). Mineral\r\nmatter, such as shale, clay, or pyrite, generally is present in the coal\r\nand becomes ash when the coal is burned.\r\n\r\nMost coal mined in the United States is bituminous coal. It is black,\r\nbrittle, breaks into angular blocks, has a shiny luster, and generally\r\nshows a banded structure.\r\n\r\nCoal mining is an important industry in Illinois, and the state contains\r\nthe largest known reserves of bituminous coal in the United States.\r\nMinable coal beds underlie about two-thirds of the state. As many as 20\r\ndifferent coal beds have been mined in Illinois, the most important\r\nbeing the Herrin (No. 6) and the Springfield (No. 5) or Harrisburg (No.\r\n5). The coal in most mining areas averages 5 to 7 feet thick and in\r\nplaces attains a thickness of 15 feet.\r\n\r\nIn underground mines the coal is approached by vertical or inclined\r\nshafts. In open cut, or strip, mines all of the overlying material\r\n(overburden) is removed, leaving the coal exposed. Coal as much as 100\r\nfeet deep is now being strip mined in Illinois.\r\n\r\nIllinois coal is now used mainly for generating electric power, for\r\nindustrial purposes, and for heating. In industry, coal is used\r\nextensively for power, heating, burning cement, firing clay products\r\nsuch as brick, tile, pottery, porcelain, and china, and making coke.\r\n\r\nCertain Illinois coals when mixed with coal from the eastern part of the\r\nUnited States, produce metallurgical coke for making steel. Gases, oils,\r\nand tars derived in processing coal for coke have been used for making\r\nmany chemical products, including dyes, perfumes, explosives, medicines,\r\ninsecticides, plastics, and road tar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PETROLEUM (15)\r\n\r\n\r\nPETROLEUM (crude oil) is classed as a mineral resource although it is a\r\nliquid hydrocarbon and not technically a mineral or rock. It is,\r\nhowever, found in the pores and fractures of rocks. The color of crude\r\noil ranges from yellow through green and brown to black.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n  Arch (anticline)\r\n    Gas\r\n    Porous rock\r\n    Nonporous rock\r\n    Oil saturated rock\r\n    Water\r\n  Break (fault)\r\n    Nonporous rock\r\n    Oil saturated porous rock\r\n    Water saturated porous rock\r\n  Trap formed by change in character of rock\r\n    Water\r\n    Nonporous rock\r\n    Porous rock\r\n\r\nPetroleum had its origin in the plants and animals buried in ancient\r\nsediments. The organic matter changed slowly into the complex mixture of\r\nhydrogen and carbon compounds that is petroleum.\r\n\r\nBecause gas is lighter than oil, and oil in turn lighter than water, gas\r\nand oil move upward in a porous rock containing all three. Gas moves to\r\nthe highest position with oil next below and water in the lowest part of\r\nthe rock. Oil pools exist where geologic barriers have stopped the\r\nmovement of gas and oil.\r\n\r\nArches (upward folds or anticlines), breaks (faults), and lateral\r\nchanges from porous to nonporous rock are geologic features that serve\r\nto localize oil pools within the reservoir rock.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is obtained by drilling wells into the reservoir rock. Gas\r\nthat is free or dissolved in the petroleum expands as pressure is\r\nreleased when the well is drilled and drives the oil to the well. Water\r\nin the reservoir rock also acts as a driving force. When this natural\r\npressure is no longer effective, other methods (secondary recovery) are\r\nused to recover the oil remaining in the reservoir.\r\n\r\nPorous sandstones and limestones are the oil-bearing rocks. Illinois\r\nalso has deposits of oil shale from which petroleum may be produced in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThousands of products are derived from petroleum, including gasoline,\r\nkerosene, naphtha, lubricating oils and waxes, medicinal oils, salves,\r\nheavy fuels, road oils, tar, and asphalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           GLACIATED PEBBLES (16)\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIATED PEBBLES are small stones whose shapes have been altered by the\r\ngrinding action of a glacier. Such pebbles commonly have at least one\r\nflattened side that shows scratches (called striae). The striae were\r\nproduced when the pebbles were pushed over bedrock or ground against\r\nother pieces of rock.\r\n\r\nGlaciers tore fragments from the bedrock over which they moved and the\r\nfragments accumulated in, on, and under the mass of ice. The rock\r\nfragments were transported, some of them far from their source, and were\r\ndeposited as the glacier moved along or when the ice melted.\r\n\r\nSoft rocks like limestone and dolomite are easily scratched, but soft\r\nrocks cannot make grooves in hard igneous and metamorphic rocks.\r\nTherefore soft rocks have more striae.\r\n\r\nGlaciated pebbles can be found in deposits in many parts of the state,\r\nespecially in northeastern and east-central Illinois. However, many\r\ndeposits near the surface have been weathered and striae have been\r\ndestroyed. An especially good place to look for striated pebbles is in\r\nquarries and strip mines where glacial drift overburden has been\r\nremoved. Pebbles found in such deposits show good striae for they are\r\nbut little weathered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SILICA SAND (17)\r\n\r\n\r\nSILICA SAND is the commercial name for sand composed almost entirely of\r\ngrains of quartz. Sand of this kind is mined in Illinois from the St.\r\nPeter Sandstone in LaSalle and Ogle Counties. The coarser grains of the\r\nsand are characteristically rounded and frosted. The frosting causes the\r\nsand to look white.\r\n\r\nIllinois silica sand has many uses. It is used just as it is mined for\r\nmolding sand in which metal castings are made, for lining industrial\r\nfurnaces, and for many other purposes. Some of the sand is washed to\r\nremove the small amount of impurities present. The washed sand is used\r\nfor such purposes as making glass, for grinding plate glass smooth, for\r\nsand blasting, for molding metal, as fracturing sand to increase the\r\nproduction of oil wells. Some silica sand is ground to a fine powder and\r\nused as a fine abrasive, as a filler in paint, and as an ingredient in\r\npottery, glazes, and enamel.\r\n\r\nA specially prepared St. Peter sand, known throughout the world as\r\nStandard Ottawa Testing Sand, is used to test the strength of cements\r\nand as a laboratory standard in physical tests of other sands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MOLDING SAND (18)\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLDING SAND is a mixture of sand and clay or other bonding material and\r\nis used to make molds in which metal is cast into various useful shapes.\r\nThere are two kinds of molding sands, synthetic and natural bonded. The\r\nfirst is an artificial mixture of silica sand and clay; the second is a\r\nnaturally occurring mixture of sand and a bonding material.\r\n\r\nFor casting, molding sand is first moistened with water and shaped into\r\na mold of the metal part to be reproduced. The mold is then allowed to\r\ndry and the molten metal poured into it. The bonding material in the\r\nsand must be strong enough to keep the mold in shape during these\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nNatural bonded molding sand is produced in Fayette, Bond, Bureau,\r\nCarroll, Kankakee, and Rock Island Counties, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TRIPOLI (19)\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIPOLI, called amorphous silica in southern Illinois, is a white or\r\nlight brown, powdery substance that rubs off on the hands like chalk. It\r\nconsists mostly of very small particles of quartz that result from the\r\nweathering of calcareous chert or highly siliceous limestone.\r\n\r\nIt is finely ground and used as “white rouge” for polishing optical\r\nlenses, as a filler in paints, in making ceramic products, as a\r\ncomponent of buffing compounds, and as a fine abrasive.\r\n\r\nTripoli occurs in Alexander and Union Counties and is milled at Elco and\r\nTamms in Alexander County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FULLER’S EARTH (20)\r\n\r\n\r\nFULLER’S EARTH is clay or silty clay material that contains very fine\r\nsilica. It is soft, nonplastic, opaque, has a greasy feel when wet, and\r\ndoes not readily break up in water. Its color varies from blue-gray to\r\nyellow or buff.\r\n\r\nFuller’s earth is valuable for its unique property of absorbing and\r\ndecolorizing substances. The material was first used to “full” or remove\r\ngrease from woolen cloth, hence its name. It also has been used to\r\nfilter and bleach mineral and vegetable oils by absorbing dark organic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIn Pulaski County in extreme southern Illinois the Porter’s Creek\r\nFormation contains deposits of clay that were at one time the source of\r\nfuller’s earth and still afford clay whose absorbent properties make it\r\nuseful as litter and as sweeping and cleaning compound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                QUARTZ (21)\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARTZ is the most common of all minerals, making up about 12 percent of\r\nthe earth’s crust. There are two main types of quartz—crystalline quartz\r\nand dense, crypto-crystalline (submicroscopic) quartz. Many dense\r\nvarieties occur in Illinois, probably the most common are chert or\r\nflint.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nCrystals of quartz are typically six-sided, elongated, have sharply\r\npointed pyramid-like ends, and are apt to grow together forming twins.\r\nGood crystals are rare in Illinois, and the crystal structure is not\r\napparent in the commonly occurring grains and masses.\r\n\r\nQuartz is brittle and hard. It may be colorless or tinted, transparent\r\nor translucent, but more commonly it is white and nearly opaque.\r\nTransparent quartz looks much like ordinary glass, but it scratches\r\nglass easily. It has a glassy to brilliant luster and breaks irregularly\r\nor with a good conchoidal fracture.\r\n\r\nSome varieties of quartz that are used for semiprecious gems are\r\nchalcedony, agate, onyx, and jasper. Chalcedony is waxy, smooth,\r\ngenerally translucent, white to gray, blue, brown, or black. Agate is a\r\nform of chalcedony that has a mottled or variegated banded appearance\r\nand may be yellow, green, red, brown, blue, gray, or black. Onyx is\r\nagate with parallel bands that as a rule are brown and white or black\r\nand white. Jasper, an impure opaque quartz, generally is red.\r\n\r\nQuartz occurs as rock crystal (colorless, transparent), milky quartz\r\n(white, nearly opaque), and smoky quartz (smoky yellow to gray or brown)\r\nin geodes from the Warsaw and Keokuk Limestones of the\r\nNauvoo-Hamilton-Warsaw area and as vein and cavity fillings associated\r\nlocally with fluorite, sphalerite, and galena in extreme southern\r\nIllinois. It also occurs as vug (cavity) fillings in limestones and\r\nsandstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FELDSPAR (22)\r\n\r\n\r\nFELDSPAR is the name applied to a group of minerals that are the second\r\nmost common of all the earth’s minerals. All feldspars are composed of\r\naluminum, silicon, and oxygen, combined with varying amounts of one or\r\nmore metals, particularly potassium, sodium, calcium, and lithium.\r\n\r\nThe minerals are hard, have a smooth glassy or pearly luster, and cleave\r\nalong two planes nearly at right angles to each other. Feldspars are\r\nfairly light weight. The streak is white, but the color of the mineral\r\nis highly variable, although potassium and sodium-bearing feldspar are\r\ncommonly white or pink and most plagioclase feldspar is gray.\r\n\r\nFeldspars are essential parts of the crystalline igneous rocks. Their\r\ndecomposition products are present in most soils. In Illinois relatively\r\nsmall feldspar crystals can be found associated with quartz and other\r\nminerals in granite and gneiss boulders and pebbles in glacial drift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MICA (23)\r\n\r\n\r\nMICA is the name of a family of complex aluminum silicate minerals that\r\ncan be split easily into paper-thin, flexible sheets. If broken across\r\nthe grain at right angles to the flat, smooth surface they fracture\r\nraggedly. In a single mica crystal the sheets range from more or less\r\ntransparent to translucent and are arranged one on top of another like a\r\ndeck of cards.\r\n\r\nMicas are tough and somewhat elastic, soft enough to be split and\r\nscratched by a fingernail, and are light weight. They have a\r\nnonmetallic, glassy or pearly luster, although yellow mica may appear to\r\nbe metallic. Color and streak depend upon the chemical composition of\r\nthe mineral. Muscovite, or white mica, contains potassium and makes a\r\ncolorless or white streak. Biotite, or black mica, contains iron and\r\nmagnesium and is commonly dark green or black, although it may be shades\r\nof yellow or brown; its streak is uncolored.\r\n\r\nMica is abundant as tiny, shimmering flakes in Illinois sands,\r\nsandstones, and shales (which are then said to be micaceous). It also is\r\ncommon in many varieties of igneous and metamorphic rocks. White or\r\nyellow flakes may show a brilliant luster and may be mistaken for\r\nsilver, platinum, or gold, but those minerals are heavy and malleable\r\nwhereas mica is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CALCITE (24)\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCITE, a common rock-forming mineral, consists of calcium carbonate.\r\nThe mineral is white or colorless, but impurities may tint it shades of\r\nyellow or gray. Transparent calcite is more rare than the tinted\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nTransparent calcite possesses the property of double refraction; an\r\nimage appears double when viewed through a calcite cleavage block.\r\n\r\nCalcite has a glassy luster, its streak is white or colorless. The\r\nmineral is of medium hardness and can be scratched by a penny or a piece\r\nof window glass but not by the fingernail. It is fairly light weight and\r\neffervesces freely in cold dilute hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nCalcite has a variety of crystal forms but in Illinois flattened\r\nblock-shaped crystals and elongate crystals with tapering points\r\n(“dogtooth spar”) are the most common. When broken, calcite cleaves into\r\nsix-sided blocks called rhombs.\r\n\r\nCrystals of calcite are found in Illinois as linings in geodes in\r\ncertain limestones and shales, especially in the Nauvoo-Hamilton-Warsaw\r\narea, and as crystalline masses in limestone and dolomite. Small amounts\r\nof clear crystalline calcite are associated with various ores in\r\nnorthwestern and extreme southern Illinois.\r\n\r\nCalcite is the principal mineral in limestones and occurs as a component\r\nof many concretions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FLUORITE (25)\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUORITE, or fluorspar, is made up of the elements calcium and fluorine.\r\nThe mineral is easily identified by its perfect cleavage, color, and\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in cubic crystals that may be twinned but is more often found\r\nas irregular masses. It can be split into diamond-shaped, eight-sided\r\nforms (octahedrons). Fluorite is commonly gray, white, or colorless, but\r\nit may be green, blue, purple, pink, or yellow. The streak is colorless\r\nand the luster glassy. It can be scratched by a knife or a piece of\r\nwindow glass, is fairly light weight, and is transparent to translucent.\r\n\r\nExtensive deposits of fluorite, one of Illinois’ important commercial\r\nminerals, occur in Hardin and Pope Counties in extreme southern\r\nIllinois, where it is associated with galena, sphalerite, calcite,\r\nbarite, and other less abundant minerals.\r\n\r\nFluorite is used to make hydrofluoric acid, to form a fluid slag in the\r\nproduction of iron and steel, in the manufacture of aluminum, to make\r\nmany chemical products, and in the ceramic industry, in which it is used\r\nto make colored glass, enamels, and glazes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GYPSUM (26)\r\n\r\n\r\nGYPSUM, hydrous calcium sulfate, is a colorless, transparent to\r\ntranslucent mineral when pure, but it often is stained yellow by\r\nimpurities. It has a white streak, is soft enough to be scratched by a\r\nfingernail, and is light weight.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nGypsum occurs in several forms. Selenite is a coarsely crystalline,\r\ntransparent variety, composed of flat, nearly diamond-shaped crystals\r\nthat can be split easily into thin sheets, have a glassy luster, and\r\noften grow together to form “fishtail twins.” Crystals of selenite occur\r\nin shales of the “Coal Measures” of southern, north-central, and western\r\nIllinois, and can be picked up at the surface.\r\n\r\nSatin spar has crystals like silky threads closely packed together,\r\nsplits parallel to the fibers, and is found as fillings in rock cracks\r\nand as thin layers in shales. Massive gypsum is granular.\r\n\r\nGypsum deposits occur deep underground in Illinois but thus far have not\r\nbeen mined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHERT (27)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERT, one of the main forms of silicon dioxide, is cryptocrystalline\r\n(submicroscopic) quartz. Most of the chert in Illinois is white or gray,\r\nbut impurities stain many deposits yellow, brown, or even pink. Chert is\r\nso hard that it can scratch glass and ordinary steel. It is fairly light\r\nweight, dense, opaque, and brittle; the luster is dull.\r\n\r\nFlint, a variety of chert, is generally dark colored, more dense, may\r\nhave a glassy luster and be transparent in thin flakes. Both chert and\r\nflint have a smooth, curved (conchoidal) fracture, but flint tends to\r\nbreak with thinner, sharper edges. Indians used flint and chert to make\r\narrow points and spearheads.\r\n\r\nChert occurs as rounded masses (nodules and concretions) or as irregular\r\nlayers in limestones and dolomites in northern, western, southwestern,\r\nand southern Illinois. Because chert is hard and more resistant to\r\nweathering than limestone or dolomite, it often remains after the rest\r\nof the rock has weathered away.\r\n\r\nChert also is abundant in many glacial deposits because it is hard and\r\nresists solution. Streams that flow through cherty bedrock or glacial\r\ndeposits carry pebbles along and concentrate them as gravel in stream\r\nchannels. Cherty stream gravels are especially abundant in western and\r\nsouthern Illinois.\r\n\r\nBrown chert gravels in the southern part of the state are used for road\r\ngravel. Other deposits in extreme southern Illinois, consisting of\r\nangular fragments of chert and a small amount of clay (known locally as\r\nnovaculite gravel) also are used for road surfacing.\r\n\r\nWhite and gray chert occur as massive bedrock deposits several hundred\r\nfeet thick in Union and Alexander Counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PYRITE AND MARCASITE (28)\r\n\r\n\r\nPYRITE and MARCASITE are iron disulfide compounds. They look much alike\r\nbut have different crystal forms. Both are brittle, hard, brassy yellow\r\nwith metallic luster, and opaque. The best distinguishing feature is\r\ncrystal shape. The pyrite crystals are cubes, but the marcasite crystals\r\nare blade- or needle-shaped.\r\n\r\nPyrite and marcasite have been mistaken for gold because they are yellow\r\nand metallic and hence are sometimes referred to as “fool’s gold”. They,\r\nhowever, are harder than gold, tarnish, and leave a dark streak, whereas\r\ngold is soft, very heavy, does not tarnish, and leaves a yellow streak.\r\nGold is malleable, but pyrite or marcasite are reduced to powder if they\r\nare pounded and give off a noticeable odor of sulfur dioxide gas if they\r\nare heated.\r\n\r\nPyrite and marcasite are found in many deposits in Illinois. They occur\r\nas grains or larger masses in some clays, shales, and limestones. They\r\nalso occur with the lead and zinc ores of northwestern Illinois and, in\r\nsmall amounts, with the fluorite and associated minerals in the extreme\r\nsouthern part of the state.\r\n\r\nBoth pyrite and marcasite are common as surface coatings, veins, and\r\nconcretionary structures in coal and in dark shales associated with\r\ncoal. They are referred to as “coal brasses” or “sulfur” when found as\r\nimpurities in coal.\r\n\r\nA potential use for pyrite and marcasite is in the manufacture of\r\nsulfuric acid for industrial use. Coal brasses recovered from Illinois\r\ncoal have been so used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LIMONITE (29)\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMONITE is an iron oxide containing water and has a complex chemical\r\ncomposition. The limonite found in Illinois may be yellow, orange, red,\r\nbrown, or black, but its streak is always yellowish brown. The mineral\r\nmay have a glassy or an earthy luster. It may be too hard to be\r\nscratched by a knife. It is of medium weight.\r\n\r\nLimonite is common and occurs as concretions and cavity fillings in\r\nsedimentary rocks, and as coatings on them, especially sandstone. It\r\nalso occurs as iron rust, as scum on stagnant water, and it accumulates\r\naround rootlets in soils. Small amounts color limestone, dolomite, clay,\r\nshale, sandstone, and gravel. Some sands are firmly cemented by brown or\r\nblack limonite and look much like iron ore. Clays containing a high\r\npercentage of limonite are called ocher.\r\n\r\nIn some states limonite is mined as an iron ore, and in Illinois it was\r\nso used in Hardin County in the middle 1800’s, but deposits are not\r\nlarge enough for profitable use now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SPHALERITE (30)\r\n\r\n\r\nSPHALERITE, zinc sulfide, is a major ore of zinc. It has a resinous\r\nluster and a white, yellow, or brown streak. Illinois sphalerite is\r\ngenerally yellow, yellowish brown, reddish brown, or brownish black. It\r\nis of medium weight, brittle, can be scratched by a piece of window\r\nglass but not by a penny. It is commonly opaque but may be translucent\r\non thin edges.\r\n\r\nSphalerite is mined with galena in northwestern Illinois and in extreme\r\nsouthern Illinois with galena and fluorite. Small crystals occasionally\r\nare found in limestones and as crystalline masses in clay-ironstone\r\nconcretions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GALENA (31)\r\n\r\n\r\nGALENA, lead sulfide, is the principal ore of lead. It is steel gray,\r\nheavy, opaque, and has a bright metallic luster, though the shiny\r\nsurface may be dulled by a coating of lead carbonate. It has a gray or\r\nblack streak, is soft enough to mark paper, and can be scratched by a\r\npenny. The cube-shaped crystals readily break into cubic, right-angled\r\nfragments. Probably the most obvious features of the mineral are its\r\nbright metallic luster on fresh surfaces, high specific gravity, and\r\ncubic cleavage.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nAt many places galena is argentiferous (silver-bearing), but Illinois\r\ngalena is relatively unimportant for its silver content. As a source of\r\nlead, however, it is an important commercial product of the state.\r\n\r\nScattered pieces of galena are found at many places in Illinois. Some\r\noccur in the glacial deposits, others occur as small pockets and as\r\ncrystals in limestones and geodes. In only two areas of the state are\r\ndeposits of commercial value. In northwestern Illinois galena occurs in\r\nassociation with sphalerite; in extreme southern Illinois it occurs in\r\nassociation with fluorite and sphalerite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCRETIONS (32)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCRETIONS are concentrations of inorganic sedimentary material within\r\nother sediments. Minerals that commonly form concretions are silica (in\r\nthe form of opal, chert, chalcedony, and quartz), calcite, siderite,\r\npyrite, marcasite, and limonite.\r\n\r\nConcretions may form either as the sediment around them is forming or\r\nafter the sediment around them has hardened. They may be formed when\r\nwater containing dissolved minerals seeps through the sediment or rock\r\nand leaves a concentration of mineral matter in a cavity or around a\r\ncentral particle (nucleus) such as the remains of a plant or animal.\r\nPortions of rock may also become firmly cemented by such mineral matter.\r\n\r\nConcretions range in size from minute particles to objects several feet\r\nin diameter. Shapes range from spheres to tubes. Many are globular or\r\nlumpy-surfaced, some are smooth. Because concretions generally are\r\nharder than the surrounding rock in which they have formed, they do not\r\nweather away as readily and may remain after the surrounding material\r\nhas been eroded.\r\n\r\nConcentrations of calcite are found in loess deposits. They may look\r\nlike bizarre, knobby figurines, and the Germans called them loess\r\nkindchen (little children of the loess).\r\n\r\nIronstone concretions, especially common in many Illinois shales, are\r\nformed by a local concentration of the mineral siderite (iron carbonate)\r\nin the rock. The concretions found in weathered outcrops commonly are\r\npartly or entirely weathered to limonite. Some ironstone concretions\r\ngrow together into odd shapes. Mazon Creek ironstone concretions of\r\nnortheastern Illinois, world famous for their fossils, are sideritic.\r\nThe concretions are commonly covered with limonite, the result of\r\noxidation.\r\n\r\nLimonite concretions, generally with a high content of clay, silt, or\r\nsand, occur in loess, shale, and sandstone.\r\n\r\nConcretions of chert and other forms of silica are common in limestones.\r\nIn many places, because of their greater resistance to weathering,\r\nlenses and nodules of chert protrude from the beds.\r\n\r\nPyrite or marcasite occur as concretions or concretion-like masses in\r\nsome coal beds and in the black shales, sometimes popularly called\r\n“slates,” above coal beds. Some other Pennsylvanian clays and shales\r\nalso contain concretions or coarsely crystalline aggregates of these\r\nminerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                GEODES (33)\r\n\r\n\r\nGEODES are roughly spherical bodies that may be filled with layers of\r\nminerals, lined with crystals, or both. The outer layer of geodes found\r\nin Illinois as a rule is composed of chalcedony, a form of finely\r\ncrystalline silica.\r\n\r\nGeodes differ from concretions in that they form inward from the outer\r\nshell, whereas concretions develop outward from a center. Even if geodes\r\nhave been completely filled by mineral matter, their inward-projecting\r\ncrystals prove that they formed within a cavity.\r\n\r\nIn a partly filled cavity, crystals generally are well formed because\r\nthey grew without being crowded. Some of the best mineral specimens\r\nknown in Illinois are found as crystal linings in geodes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nQuartz is the most common mineral deposited in geodes, but calcite,\r\naragonite, dolomite, siderite, pyrite, galena, fluorite, and sphalerite\r\nalso are found.\r\n\r\nGeodes ranging in size from less than one inch to a foot or more in\r\ndiameter can be gathered from streams where they have accumulated as\r\nresidual boulders after the rock in which they were enclosed has been\r\neroded.\r\n\r\nHollow geodes are the most desirable because they have better crystals.\r\nThey can be distinguished from solid ones by their comparative lightness\r\nof weight.\r\n\r\nGeodes are commonly associated with limestone and dolomite, at some\r\nplaces with shale. In Illinois they can be found most easily in the\r\nWarsaw Formation in the area of Nauvoo, Hamilton, and Warsaw, but they\r\nalso occur in other areas and other formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANIMAL FOSSILS (34)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrehistoric animals lived in water, on land, and in the air, and left\r\nboth direct and indirect evidence of their existence, evidence we now\r\ncall fossils.\r\n\r\nMillions of ancient animals died without leaving a trace, but some,\r\nespecially those that had hard parts such as shells, bones, or teeth,\r\nmay be found preserved in rocks much as they were when buried beneath\r\nsediment on the floor of an ancient sea. Sometimes only imprints of the\r\noutside or fillings of the inside of the shells remain, the original\r\nmaterial having been completely dissolved. Footprints of land or\r\namphibious animals, burrows made by clams, or holes made by worms also\r\nare fossils.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nThe animals whose remains are fossilized lived and died while the\r\nsediments that contained them were being deposited, and they provide\r\nclues to the types of life and climate then existing. Fossils of animals\r\ncharacteristic of a certain time are an index to the age of formations\r\nwhere they occur. For example, if a certain trilobite (an ancient\r\nrelative of the crayfish and lobster) is known to have lived only during\r\na definite time, then all rocks in which it is found are the same age.\r\n\r\nFossils of animals that lived in the sea are exposed in rocks in many\r\nparts of Illinois, especially in quarries, river bluffs, and road cuts.\r\n\r\nThe oldest fossils found in Illinois are shells of marine\r\nanimals—snails, corals, crinoids, brachiopods, trilobites, pelecypods\r\n(clams), cephalopods, bryozoa, arthropods, and others. The youngest\r\nfossils are teeth and bones of prehistoric bison, giant beavers, deer,\r\nmammoths and mastodons of the “Ice Age,” and snails found in glacial\r\nloess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PLANT FOSSILS (35)\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT FOSSILS are the remains of prehistoric plants. Woody structures of\r\nplants aid preservation just as hard parts of animals do. Leaves and\r\nplants without much woody material generally were well preserved only if\r\nthey were buried quickly in fine, soft sediment.\r\n\r\nThe most famous Illinois plant fossils are those from the Mazon Creek\r\narea in Grundy and Will Counties of northeastern Illinois. The plant\r\nmaterial acted as a nucleus around which iron minerals accumulated to\r\nform concretions. Many good fossils—of trunks, branches, leaves, and\r\nseeds—are found in coals and in shale directly overlying coals.\r\nDescendants of “Coal Measures” plants, such as ferns, mosses, and\r\nrushes, are still living today, but they no longer thrive as they did in\r\nthe warm, moist climate of the Pennsylvanian forests.\r\n\r\nSome plants of Pennsylvanian age are petrified, and occasionally such\r\ntrees or stumps are found. Petrified trees are found also in the upper\r\nMesozoic deposits of southern Illinois. Fossils of “Ice Age” plants\r\nclosely related to forms living at the present time are occasionally\r\nfound in peat bogs or scattered throughout glacial deposits.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     KEYS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF COMMON ILLINOIS ROCKS AND MINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo keys, one for minerals and one for rocks, briefly present clues that\r\nmay aid the collector in identifying rocks and minerals found in\r\nIllinois. In outline form, the keys are a guide to some of the easily\r\nobservable properties that various rocks and minerals display.\r\n\r\nThe rocks and minerals in the school set of “Typical Rocks and Minerals\r\nof Illinois” are included, plus other relatively common ones you might\r\nfind in Illinois. Because of the great diversity of rocks and minerals\r\nin this state, the keys are not conclusive. It is therefore suggested\r\nyou consult other more complete keys (such as that in Dana’s _Manual of\r\nMineralogy_) when identifying rocks and minerals that are either from\r\nother states or are difficult to identify.\r\n\r\nThe minerals (p. 30-35) are arranged in two groups: 1) those with a\r\nmetallic luster, and 2) those with a nonmetallic luster. Each group is\r\narranged according to increasing hardness. Other characteristics such as\r\ncolor, streak, cleavage, fracture, and composition are listed.\r\n\r\nThe rocks (p. 36-39) are arranged according to their reaction to dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid applied to a scratched surface. (The acid reacts more\r\nreadily to powdered material produced by scratching the rock.) After the\r\nreaction to acid has been determined, the texture and components of the\r\nrock should be noted. Because rocks grade into one another, clear\r\ndistinctions are not always possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL IDENTIFICATION KEY\r\n\r\n                      I.

Hammer (bricklayer’s) with one chisel or pick head.\r\n\r\n2. Cold chisel about 6 inches long with an edge about ½-inch wide.\r\n\r\n3. Dilute hydrochloric (muriatic) acid (10 percent solution) in a\r\n      dropper bottle for testing the presence of carbonate minerals.\r\n      Mark the bottle POISON. If acid is spilled on skin or clothing,\r\n      wipe immediately and, if possible, rinse with water.\r\n\r\n4. Magnifying glass or hand lens—10 power is probably most useful.\r\n\r\n5. Hardness testers—penny, square of window glass, pocket knife, or\r\n      nail.\r\n\r\n6. Streak plate—piece of unglazed white porcelain (such as the back of a\r\n      tile) for testing the color of the streak of minerals.\r\n\r\n7. Notebook and pencil for keeping records of the locality and bed from\r\n      which specimens are collected.\r\n\r\n8. Collecting bag—a musette bag, a knapsack, or similar bag of strong\r\n      material.\r\n\r\n9. Heavy gloves and goggles to protect hands and eyes.\r\n\r\n10. Labels and wrappings. Field identification of specimens may be\r\n      written on adhesive tape and attached to the specimen or on a slip\r\n      of paper enclosed in the wrapping. Newspaper, brown paper, or\r\n      paper bags can be used for wrapping specimens. Label the outside\r\n      of the wrapped specimen too. Take only the best specimens home\r\n      with you. Trim specimens to hand size (about 2 by 3 inches).\r\n\r\nAll specimens should be labeled with the following information: name of\r\n      mineral or rock type, where found, collector’s name, and date. As\r\n      your collection grows, you may want to set up a system of\r\n      cataloging. List specimens and assign a number to each one. Place\r\n      a small amount of white enamel on a corner of each specimen; when\r\n      the enamel dries, number the sample with India ink; coat number\r\n      with lacquer. Corresponding numbers should be entered on your list\r\n      of specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EDUCATIONAL EXTENSION PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book was prepared by the Educational Extension Section of the\r\nIllinois State Geological Survey, principally Betty Jean Hanagan, I.\r\nEdgar Odom, and Shirley J. Trueblood, under the direction of George M.\r\nWilson. They were assisted by other members of the Survey staff,\r\nespecially J. E. Lamar and J. C. Bradbury of the Industrial Minerals\r\nSection.\r\n\r\nEducational Extension also serves the public by assembling and\r\ndistributing rock and mineral collections for Illinois educational\r\ngroups, giving lectures, preparing exhibits, answering queries about\r\nidentification of rocks and minerals, reporting Survey news, and\r\nconducting earth science field trips.\r\n\r\nDuring each year six field trips are conducted in widely separated parts\r\nof the state for teachers, students, and laymen. The general program is\r\nespecially designed to assist in teaching the earth sciences and to help\r\nmake Illinois citizens aware of the state’s great mineral wealth.\r\n\r\n                                        Illinois State Geological Survey\r\n                                                        Urbana, Illinois\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ILLINOIS _Land of Lincoln_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
