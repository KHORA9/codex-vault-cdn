FREDERICK WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the interest and the importance of the subject make it worth\r\nwhile to follow out every clew that may lead to the approximate\r\ndetermination of the age of Niagara Falls. During this past season, in\r\nconnection with some work done for the New York Central Railroad upon\r\ntheir branch line which runs along the eastern face of the gorge from\r\nBloody Run to Lewiston, I fortunately came into possession of data\r\nfrom which an estimate of the age of the falls can be made entirely\r\nindependent of those which have heretofore been current. The bearing\r\nand importance of the new data can best be seen after a brief _résumé_\r\nof the efforts heretofore made to solve this important problem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Looking north from below the Whirlpool,\r\nshowing the electric road at the bottom of the east side of the gorge,\r\nand the steam road descending the face about halfway to the top.]\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Sir Charles Lyell and the late Prof. James Hall visited the\r\nfalls together; but, having no means of determining the rate of\r\nrecession, except from the indefinite reports of residents and guides,\r\nthey could place no great confidence in the \"guess,\" made by Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, that it could not be more than one foot a year. As the\r\nlength of the gorge from Lewiston up is about seven miles, the time\r\nrequired for its erosion at this rate would be thirty-five thousand\r\nyears. The great authority and popularity of Lyell led the general\r\npublic to put more confidence in this estimate than the distinguished\r\nauthors themselves did. Mr. Bakewell, another eminent English\r\ngeologist, at about the same time estimated the rate of the recession\r\nas threefold greater than Lyell and Hall had done, which would reduce\r\nthe time to about eleven thousand years.\r\n\r\nBut, to prepare the way for a more definite settlement of the\r\nquestion, the New York Geological Survey, under Professor Hall's\r\ndirection, had a careful trigonometric survey of the Horseshoe Fall\r\nmade in 1842, erecting monuments at the points at which their angles\r\nwere taken, so that, after a sufficient lapse of time, the actual rate\r\nof recession could be more accurately determined. In 1886 Mr.\r\nWoodward, of the United States Geological Survey, made a new survey,\r\nand found that the actual amount of recession in the center of the\r\nHorseshoe Fall had proceeded at an average rate of about five feet per\r\nannum. The subject was thoroughly discussed by Drs. Pohlman and\r\nGilbert, at the Buffalo meeting of the American Association in 1886,\r\nwhen it was proved, to the satisfaction of every one, that, if the\r\nsupply of water had been constant throughout its history, the whole\r\nwork of eroding the gorge from Lewiston to the Falls would have been\r\naccomplished, at the present rate of recession, in about seven\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nBut the question was immediately raised, Has the supply of water in\r\nNiagara River been constant? It was my privilege, in the autumn of\r\n1892 (see Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. iv, pp.\r\n421-427), to bring forth the first positive evidence that the water\r\npouring over Niagara had for a time been diverted, having been turned\r\nthrough Lake Nipissing down the valley of the Mattawa into the Ottawa\r\nRiver, following nearly the line of Champlain's old trail and of the\r\npresent Canadian Pacific Railroad. The correctness of this inference\r\nhas been abundantly confirmed by subsequent investigations of Mr. F.\r\nB. Taylor and Dr. Robert Bell.[A] The occasion of this diversion of\r\nthe drainage of the Great Lakes from the Niagara through the Ottawa\r\nValley was the well-known northerly subsidence of the land in Canada\r\nat the close of the Glacial period. When the ice melted off from the\r\nlower part of the Ottawa Valley the land stood five hundred feet lower\r\nthan it does now, but the extent of this subsidence diminished both to\r\nthe south and the west, making it difficult to estimate just how great\r\nit was at the Nipissing outlet. A subsidence of one hundred feet at\r\nthat point, however, would now divert the waters into the Ottawa\r\nRiver. That it actually was so diverted is shown both by converging\r\nhigh-level shore lines at the head of the Mattawa Valley and by the\r\nimmense delta deposits at its junction with the Ottawa, to which\r\nattention was first called in my paper referred to above.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: See article by Mr. Taylor on The Scoured Bowlders of the\r\nMattawa Valley, in the American Journal of Science, March, 1897, pp.\r\n208-218.]\r\n\r\nThe indeterminate question which remained was, At what rate did this\r\npostglacial elevation of land which has brought it up to its present\r\nlevel proceed? Dr. Gilbert, Professor Spencer, and Mr. Taylor have\r\nbrought forth a variety of facts which, according to their\r\ninterpretation, show that this rate of elevation was so slow that from\r\ntwenty thousand to thirty thousand years was required to restore to\r\nthe Niagara River its present volume of water. Their arguments are\r\nbased upon the varying width and depth of the Niagara gorge, proving,\r\nas they think, the presence of a smaller amount of water during the\r\nerosion of some portions. Dr. Gilbert has also brought forward some\r\nfacts concerning the extent of supposed erosion produced by the\r\ndiverted waters of Niagara when passing over an intermediate outlet\r\nbetween Lake Simcoe and Lake Nipissing. But the difficulty of\r\nobtaining any safe basis for calculation upon these speculative\r\nconsiderations has increased the desire to find a means of calculation\r\nwhich should be independent of the indeterminate problems involved.\r\nThat I think I have found, and so have made a beginning in obtaining\r\ndesired results. _The new evidence lies in the extent of the\r\nenlargement of the mouth of the Niagara gorge at Lewiston since the\r\nrecession of the falls began._\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the oldest part of the Niagara gorge is at its\r\nmouth, at Lewiston, where the escarpment suddenly breaks down to the\r\nlevel of Lake Ontario. The walls of the gorge rise here to a height of\r\nthree hundred and forty feet above the level of the river. It is clear\r\nthat from the moment the recession of the falls began at Lewiston the\r\nwalls of the gorge on either side have been subject to the action of\r\nconstant disintegrating agencies, tending to enlarge the mouth and\r\nmake it V-shaped. What I did last summer was to measure the exact\r\namount of this enlargement, and to obtain an approximate estimate of\r\nthe rate at which it is going on.[B] As this enlargement proceeds\r\nwholly through the action of atmospheric agencies, the conditions are\r\nconstant, and it is hoped that sufficiently definite results have been\r\nobtained to set some limits to the speculations which have been made\r\nupon more indefinite grounds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: For opportunity to do this work I am indebted to the\r\ninterest of President S. R. Callaway, of the New York Central\r\nRailroad. The measurements were made by Mr. George S. Tibbits,\r\nengineer of the western division. The photographs were taken by Mr. C.\r\nF. Dutton, of Cleveland.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--View looking east across the gorge near the\r\nmouth, showing the railroads and the outcrops of Clinton and Niagara\r\nlimestones above the steam road.]\r\n\r\nThe face on the east side of the gorge presents a series of alternate\r\nlayers of hard and soft rocks, of which certain portions are very\r\nsusceptible to the disintegrating agencies of the atmosphere. The\r\nsummit consists of from twenty to thirty feet of compact Niagara\r\nlimestone, which is underlaid by about seventy feet of Niagara shale;\r\nwhich in turn rests upon a compact stratum of Clinton limestone about\r\ntwenty feet thick, which again is underlaid by a shaly deposit of\r\nseventy feet, resting upon a compact stratum of Medina sandstone\r\ntwenty feet thick, below which a softer sandstone, that crumbles\r\nsomewhat readily, extends to the level of the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Looking up the gorge from near Lewiston,\r\nshowing on the left the exposed situation of the eastern face of the\r\ngorge at the extreme angle, where the measurements were made.]\r\n\r\nThe present width of the river at the mouth of the gorge is seven\r\nhundred and seventy feet. It is scarcely possible that the original\r\nwidth of the gorge was here any less than this, for in the narrowest\r\nplaces above, even where the Niagara limestone is much thicker than at\r\nLewiston, it is nowhere much less than six hundred feet in width. Nor\r\nis it probable that the river has to any considerable extent enlarged\r\nits channel at the mouth of the gorge at the water level. On the\r\ncontrary, it is more probable that the mouth has been somewhat\r\ncontracted, for the large masses of Niagara and Clinton limestone and\r\nMedina sandstone which have fallen down as the shales were undermined\r\nhave accumulated at the base as a talus, which the present current of\r\nthe river is too feeble to remove. This talus of great blocks of hard\r\nstone has effectually riprapped the banks, and really encroached to\r\nsome extent upon the original channel.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore assume with confidence that the enlargement, under\r\nsubaërial agencies, of the mouth of the gorge at the top of the\r\nescarpment has been no greater than the distance from the present\r\nwater's edge to the present line of the escarpment at the summit of\r\nthe Niagara limestone. This we found to be three hundred and\r\neighty-eight feet--that is, the upper stratum of hard rock on the east\r\nside of the gorge had retreated that distance, through the action of\r\natmospheric agencies, since the formation of the gorge first began.\r\nThe accompanying photogravures and diagram will present the facts at a\r\nglance. The total work of enlargement on the east side of the gorge\r\nhas been the removal of an inverted triangular section of the rock\r\nstrata three hundred and forty feet high and three hundred and\r\neighty-eight feet base, which would be the same as a rectangular\r\nsection of one hundred and ninety-four feet base. From this one can\r\nreadily see that if the average erosion has been at the rate of one\r\nquarter of an inch per annum, the whole amount would have fallen down\r\nin less than ten thousand years; while if the time is lengthened, as\r\nsome would have it, to forty thousand years, the rate would be reduced\r\nto one sixteenth of an inch per year.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the construction of the railroad along the face of the\r\neastern wall of the gorge affords opportunity to study the rate of\r\nerosion during a definite period of time. The accompanying\r\nphotogravures will illustrate to the eye facts which it is hard to\r\nmake impressive by words alone. The course of the road is diagonally\r\ndown the face of the gorge from its summit for a distance of about two\r\nmiles, descending in that space about two hundred feet to the outcrop\r\nof hard quartzose Medina sandstone. The lower mile of this exposure\r\npresents the typical situation for making an estimate of the rate at\r\nwhich the face is crumbling away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Nearer view of the upper portion of the face\r\nnear the mouth, showing the exposure of the situation at that point.]\r\n\r\nBeginning at what used to be known as the \"Hermit's Cave,\" near the\r\nCatholic College grounds, where the Niagara shale is well exposed, and\r\nextending to the outer limit of the gorge, the height of the face\r\nabove the railroad averages one hundred and fifty feet. Now, the\r\ncrumbling away of the superincumbent cliffs gives continual trouble to\r\nthe road. Three watchmen are constantly employed along this distance\r\nto remove the _débris_ which falls down, and to give warning if more\r\ncomes down than they can remove before trains are due. The seventy\r\nfeet of Niagara shale, and the equal thickness of shaly Medina rock\r\nwhich underlies the Clinton limestone, are constantly falling off,\r\neven in fair weather, as any one can experience by walking along the\r\nbank; while after storms, and especially in the spring, when the frost\r\nis coming out, the disintegration proceeds at a much more rapid rate.\r\nSometimes two or three days are required by the whole force of section\r\nhands to throw over the bank the result of a single fall of material.\r\n\r\nAt a rate of one quarter of an inch of waste each year the amount of\r\n_débris_ accumulating for removal on the track along this distance\r\nwould be only six hundred and ten cubic yards per annum--that is, if\r\nsix hundred and ten cubic yards of material falls down from one mile\r\nof the face of the wall where it is a hundred and fifty feet high, the\r\nwhole amount of enlargement of the mouth of the gorge would be\r\naccomplished in less than ten thousand years. Exact accounts have not\r\nbeen kept by the railroad; but even a hasty examination of the face of\r\nthe wall makes it sure that the actual amount removed has been greatly\r\nin excess of six hundred yards annually. This estimate is based partly\r\non the impression of the railroad officials as to the cost of removal,\r\nand partly on the impressions of the watchmen who spend their time in\r\nkeeping guard and in the work of removing it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Showing extent of erosion at base of the\r\nNiagara shale since 1854. (See description in the text.)]\r\n\r\nBut that is not all. The accompanying photogravures indicate an actual\r\namount of removal over a part of the area enormously in excess of the\r\nrate supposed. Fig. 5 shows a portion of the precipice, a hundred feet\r\nhigh, where the road first comes down to the level of the Clinton\r\nlimestone, and where, consequently, the whole thickness of the Niagara\r\nshale is accessible to examination. Fortunately, Patrick MacNamara,\r\nthe watchman at this station, was a workman on the road at the time of\r\nits construction in 1854, and has been connected with the road ever\r\nsince, having been at his present post for twelve years. We have\r\ntherefore his distinct remembrance, as well as the appearance of the\r\nbank, to inform us where the face of the original excavation then was.\r\nIn the picture he is standing at the original face, while the other\r\nfigure is nearly at the back of the space which has been left empty by\r\nthe crumbling away of the shale. The horizontal distance is fully\r\ntwenty feet, and the rocks overhang to that amount for the whole\r\ndistance exposed in the photograph. All this amount of shale has\r\nfallen down in forty-four years, making a rate many times larger than\r\nthe highest we have taken as the basis of our estimate. Of course,\r\nthis rate for the crumbling away of the Niagara shale on its fresh\r\nexposure is much in excess of the average rate for a long period of\r\ntime; but it is clear that the rate of erosion at the base of the\r\nNiagara limestone at the mouth of the gorge can never have been\r\nsufficiently slow to reduce the total average much below the assumed\r\nrate of a quarter of an inch a year.\r\n\r\nTo impress the truth of this statement it is only necessary to follow\r\nthe progress, in imagination, of the crumbling process which has\r\nbrought the side of the gorge to its present condition. At first the\r\nface of the gorge was perpendicular, the plunging water making the\r\ngorge as wide at the bottom as at the top. At successive stages the\r\nstrata of shale on the side would crumble away, as is shown in our\r\nphotograph, and undermine the strata of hard rock. The large fragments\r\nwould fall to the bottom, and, being too large to be carried away by\r\nthe current, would form the talus to which we have already referred,\r\nwhich would grow in height with every successive century. The actual\r\nprogress of the enlargement would thus be periodic, and not capable of\r\nmeasurement by decades; but after centuries the progress would be\r\nclearly marked, and especially whenever there was a falling away of\r\nthe lower stratum of compact Medina sandstone, which is about\r\ntwo hundred feet below the top, would a new cycle of rapid\r\ndisintegrations in the superincumbent strata follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Section, drawn to equal vertical and\r\nhorizontal scale, showing enlargement of Niagara gorge on the east\r\nside at its mouth at Lewiston: 1, Niagara limestone, 20 to 30 feet; 2,\r\nNiagara shale, 70 feet; 3, Clinton limestone, 20 to 30 feet; 4,\r\nClinton and Medina shale, 70 feet; 5, Quartzose Medina sandstone, 20\r\nto 30 feet; 6, softer Medina sandstone, 120 feet above water level.]\r\n\r\nAn important point to be noticed, and which is evident from two of the\r\nreproduced photographs (Figs. 3 and 4), is that the talus has never\r\nreached up so high as to check the disintegration at the mouth of the\r\ngorge of the Niagara shale and limestone which form the upper one\r\nhundred feet of the face, and which exhibit the maximum amount of\r\nenlargement which has taken place. The thickness of the Niagara\r\nlimestone is here so small that it has not been so important an\r\nelement in forming the talus as it has been farther up the stream,\r\nwhere it is two or three times as thick. Now, while our original\r\nsupposition was that one quarter of an inch annually was eroded from\r\nthe upper two hundred feet, this would involve the erosion of a half\r\ninch per annum over the top of the gorge to bring the calculation\r\nwithin the limit of ten thousand years. It certainly is difficult for\r\none who examines the facts upon the ground to believe that the\r\ncrumbling away of this exposed Niagara shale could have been at any\r\nless rate than that; so that the estimate of about ten thousand years\r\nfor the date of that stage of the Glacial period in which Niagara\r\nRiver first began its work of erosion at Lewiston (an estimate which\r\nis supported by a great variety of facts independent of those relating\r\nto the Niagara gorge) is strongly confirmed by this new line of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can see, the only question of serious doubt that can be\r\nraised respecting this calculation will arise from the possible\r\nsupposition that, when the eastern drainage over the Niagara channel\r\nbegan, the land stood at such a relatively lower level as would reduce\r\nthe height of the fall to about half that of the present escarpment at\r\nthat point; when it might be supposed that a protecting talus had\r\naccumulated which would interrupt the lateral erosion for the\r\nindefinite period when the drainage was being drawn around by way of\r\nthe recently opened Lake Nipissing and Mattawa outlet. Then, upon the\r\nresumption of the present line of drainage, with the land standing at\r\nnearly its present level, the talus may have been undercut, and so\r\nfallen down to leave the upper strata exposed as at present. But there\r\ndoes not seem to be sufficient warrant for such a supposition to make\r\nit necessary seriously to entertain it, while the objections to it are\r\nsignificant and serious. First, the present narrowness of the river at\r\nthe water level is such that it does not give much opportunity for\r\nenlargement after the first formation of the gorge; secondly, the\r\nNiagara limestone at the mouth of the gorge is so thin (stated by Hall\r\nto be twenty feet thick) that it would not form a protecting talus,\r\neven at half its present height.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. S.--Since the above was written there has been reported in the\r\npapers an immense fall of rock from the east side of the gorge, near\r\nthe head of the Whirlpool rapids. The estimate made of the amount is\r\none hundred thousand tons. If that estimate is correct, it is a very\r\nimpressive illustration of how the average fall of material from the\r\nside of the gorge is occasionally increased by a single instance. In\r\nmaking our calculations above, the total amount of material annually\r\nfalling off from the portion of the side of the gorge under\r\nconsideration amounted only to 1,237 tons, while the amount of\r\nmaterial was 611 cubic yards. But the 100,000 tons which came off in a\r\nsingle slide a few weeks ago would be equal to twenty inches in\r\nthickness from the whole face of the cliff, where our estimate was\r\nonly a quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\nN.

Smith Woodward and Dr. F.\r\n     P. Moreno.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABUSE OF PUBLIC CHARITY.\r\n\r\nBY BIRD S. COLER,\r\n\r\nCOMPTROLLER OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen per cent of all the human beings who die in New York city are\r\nburied in Potter's Field at public expense; but the records of\r\norganized charity, official and semiofficial, show that less than one\r\nper cent of the living are paupers or dependent persons. There are two\r\nexplanations of the difference between the number of living poor and\r\npenniless dead. The chief one is that abuse of public charity has\r\ngrown to such proportions that the city has become the Mecca of the\r\nchronic idlers and tramps of the entire country. It is easier for an\r\nindustrious and shrewd professional beggar to live in luxury in New\r\nYork than to exist in any other city in the world. No magic wand of\r\nancient fable was ever more potent to unlock the gates of castle or\r\nprison than the name of charity is to open a way to the public\r\ntreasury. The liberal and well-nigh indiscriminate giving of the money\r\nof the taxpayers for the relief of sickness and poverty has been\r\ncommanded by law, sanctioned by custom, and approved by public opinion\r\nuntil the possibility of checking or reforming the abuse grows more\r\nand more remote as the burden increases and the evil results multiply.\r\n\r\nThe city of New York gives annually to public charity more than\r\n$5,000,000, and contributes indirectly $2,000,000 more. Of the money\r\nraised by taxation for city purposes proper (State taxes, interest,\r\nand county expenses eliminated), almost twelve per cent is properly\r\nchargeable to relief of poverty and sickness. Of this expenditure more\r\nthan $3,000,000 is paid to private institutions and societies over\r\nwhich the city authorities have no control or supervision. The\r\npayments are made in compliance with the provisions of acts of the\r\nState Legislature. The only provision in these laws that enables the\r\ncity officers to protect the treasury from fraud is a clause under\r\nwhich the comptroller is permitted to verify the bills of the\r\ninstitutions for the care of committed persons. There is a\r\nconstitutional safeguard against outright swindling of the city, in\r\nthe requirement that charitable institutions shall be inspected and\r\ntheir bills approved by the State Board of Charities, but the system\r\nis open to many abuses where the public officers are powerless.\r\n\r\nThe present comptroller of the city has found that a number of alleged\r\ncharitable institutions and societies receiving money from the city\r\napply nearly all their funds to the payment of salaries of officers\r\nand employees, while their relief work is very limited and of doubtful\r\ncharacter. Other societies, he found upon investigation, really\r\nencourage professional beggars without in any case relieving deserving\r\npoor. A few cases were so flagrant in their abuse of public charity\r\nthat the further payment of city money to the societies was refused.\r\nIn one case he found that a society which claimed a board of directors\r\nand numerous officers was really managed by one person, who in one\r\nyear had received $1,500 from the city and $70 from all other sources,\r\nand had expended $1,300 of the amount for salaries and $40 for the\r\nrelief of the destitute.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Public Charities, for the maintenance of which the\r\nsum of $1,941,215 is appropriated for the year 1899, is controlled\r\nentirely by the city. The balance of the $5,000,000 appropriated\r\nannually for the same general purpose is divided among more than two\r\nhundred societies and institutions managed by corporations or private\r\nindividuals. In theory none of these private institutions is supported\r\nby the city, the municipality merely paying to them a fixed sum, which\r\nis supposed to be supplemented by private donations. In reality nine\r\ntenths of them could not exist six months without the money they\r\nreceive from the public treasury. Very few of these semipublic\r\ncharities have an income from all other sources equal to the\r\nappropriation from the city.\r\n\r\nThe city pays for the support of a child in a private institution the\r\nsum of $110 a year, and the average allowance for the maintenance of\r\nan adult is $150. The percentage of children among the dependent\r\npersons is almost three to one, so the $5,000,000 public charity fund\r\nwould feed and clothe more than forty thousand persons each year if\r\napplied directly to that purpose. In the distribution of this great\r\nsum of public money, however, fully $2,000,000 of the amount is\r\nabsorbed in the payment of salaries and expenses, and therein exists\r\nan abuse of public charity so great that the present comptroller of\r\nthe city some months ago appealed to the Legislature for relief in the\r\nform of legislation which would enable the local authorities to stop\r\npayments to many societies. There are numerous small institutions,\r\nsome of them having the indorsement and moral support of leading\r\ncitizens, that spend from sixty to eighty per cent of all the money\r\nthey receive in the payment of salaries, and in one case discovered by\r\nthe comptroller the expenses absorbed ninety-four per cent of the\r\ntotal income of the society!\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that any of these societies are deliberately\r\ndishonest in their dealings with the city and the public. They are as\r\na rule conducted by men and women whose motives are good, but who have\r\nno experience or practical knowledge to fit them for the management of\r\na charitable institution. They are easily imposed upon by professional\r\nbeggars, and in most cases fail in their well-meant efforts to reach\r\nand relieve the deserving who are in actual need. Most of the small\r\norganizations that waste public money in misdirected charity are\r\ncontrolled by women of eminent respectability, but with no knowledge\r\nwhatever of the details of the work they have undertaken. The result\r\nin many cases has been that they employ enough help to absorb the bulk\r\nof the money received without realizing that they are doing more harm\r\nthan good.\r\n\r\nThe city does not spend its own money cheaply. Of the appropriation of\r\n$1,941,215 for the support of the Department of Charities for the\r\ncurrent year the sum of $529,626 is allowed for the payment of\r\nsalaries of commissioners and employees. No private business could\r\nlong endure if conducted on such a basis. Some of the institutions\r\nwhere hundreds of homeless waifs from the streets are cared\r\nfor--institutions semipublic in character, managed by men of more than\r\nlocal reputation as experts in such work, societies founded by men and\r\nwomen whose lives have been devoted to doing good--show by their\r\nannual reports that more than half their income is paid out in\r\nsalaries. One institution that received $30,000 from the city in 1898\r\nand $20,000 from all other sources, reported a salary account of\r\n$31,000. Another, receiving $100,000 from the city and $120,000 in\r\ndonations, had a salary account of $115,000. For every five persons\r\nsupported by public charity there are three persons employed on salary\r\nin the work of relief. Of every five dollars paid out by the city\r\ntreasury to relieve the sick and destitute, two dollars is absorbed by\r\nthe salary and expense accounts.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the law under which city money is paid to private\r\ncharitable institutions is that they relieve the municipal authorities\r\nof the care of a certain number of persons who would otherwise become\r\npublic charges to be maintained in the hospitals, asylums, or homes\r\nowned by the city. It is also a popular theory that young children who\r\nhave become a public charge will receive better care and training in a\r\nhome controlled by a private society than they would in a public\r\ninstitution. Appropriations and legislation are also obtained by\r\nprivate organizations on the representation that for every dollar paid\r\nto them by the city or State an equal amount will be contributed by\r\nfounders and subscribers. This representation is not always true, and\r\nin many cases it happens that when a society begins to receive money\r\nfrom the city private contributions fall off. When the city\r\nauthorities first took up the question of caring for homeless and\r\ndestitute persons and found that they had to deal with a grave\r\nproblem, some of the private charitable institutions were already in\r\nexistence and came forward with offers to share the burden. At that\r\ntime it was considered a good business arrangement for the city to use\r\nprivate societies in the work of relief. This plan, it was expected,\r\nwould save the city considerable money, because the officers of the\r\nsocieties would contribute their services, and the cost of applying\r\npublic charity to necessary relief would in that way be reduced to a\r\nminimum. That expectation has not been realized. With the rapid\r\nincrease of necessity and demand for public relief the expenses of\r\nadministration of the societies have increased out of all proportion\r\nto the work accomplished. In the beginning the city authorities\r\nshirked a public duty, and by giving city money to private persons who\r\nwere willing to relieve them of a burden they invited the creation of\r\nnew societies and a steadily increasing demand for more funds.\r\n\r\nOf the two hundred and twenty charitable societies that receive money\r\nfrom the city more than one hundred have been organized during the\r\npast ten years. The records of the finance department and the annual\r\nreports of these new organizations show that many of them have\r\nreceived from the city sixty to ninety per cent of all the funds they\r\nhave handled, and that almost the same percentage of their total\r\nincome was charged to expenses, the chief item of expense in every\r\ncase being the payment of salaries to officers. Year after year the\r\npromoters and officers of these small organizations appear before the\r\ncity authorities when the annual budget is to be passed, and,\r\nattempting to excuse the poor showing they make, say, in pleading for\r\na larger appropriation, \"We hope to do better next year.\" The most\r\nliberal-minded defender of indiscriminate public charity would find it\r\ndifficult to excuse the existence of some of these societies.\r\n\r\nThere are scores of small organizations helping to spend public money\r\nthat are unknown to the general public. In fact, some of them are\r\nnever heard of except when their officers appear before the Board of\r\nEstimate once a year to ask for more money. There is a society,\r\norganized for the purpose of supplying clothing to shipwrecked\r\nsailors, which for several years obtained a small appropriation from\r\nthe city. When the officers requested an increase of the amount\r\nallowed, the city authorities asked for some particulars of the work\r\ndone. The report submitted in reply showed that the society had\r\nreceived, in addition to the money obtained from the city, several\r\ndonations of second-hand clothing and one box of wristlets (knit bands\r\nto be worn on the wrists); had sent to a sailor shipwrecked on the\r\ncoast of Oregon a suit of underwear, a pair of hose, and a rubber\r\ncoat; to a crew wrecked on the reefs of Florida some shoes and oilskin\r\ncaps. There was no report of relief or clothing supplied to a sailor\r\nor any other person in the city or State of New York, but there was a\r\ncharge for salaries that almost balanced the amount received from the\r\ncity treasury.\r\n\r\nAnother of the minor institutions is a society that is engaged in an\r\noriginal method of charitable work. The agents of this society, or the\r\nmembers themselves, go out into the slums of the city on Sunday\r\nmornings and gather in a number of tramps. The homeless wanderers are\r\nassembled in a room hired for the purpose and supplied with a warm\r\nbreakfast, after which they are compelled to listen to a sermon and a\r\nlecture. They are then allowed to depart and live as best they can\r\nuntil the following Sunday. For a number of years this society has\r\nreceived a small appropriation from the city on the ground that it is\r\na useful public charity. To all of these small societies, no matter\r\nwhat may be their alleged field of charitable work, city money is\r\nappropriated without specific knowledge of the exact purpose to which\r\nit is applied. By legislation or petition, backed by the influence of\r\nprominent citizens, scores of these petty organizations, some of them\r\nmerely a fad or whim of an idle man or woman, have been placed on the\r\nlist of semipublic charities to be aided at the expense of the\r\ntaxpayers, and there they remain year after year without so much as a\r\nserious inquiry as to their merits or the work they accomplish. The\r\ncity authorities who grant the appropriations do not and can not know\r\nhow the money they give to such societies is to be expended, because\r\nthey have no legal authority to investigate the conduct of such\r\ninstitutions. The city officers, therefore, are not to blame. The\r\nfault seems to rest primarily upon that condition of public opinion\r\nthat is cheerfully tolerant of any fraud committed in the name of\r\ncharity, and secondly upon the members of the Legislature who vote\r\nwithout question or investigation for all legislation asked for by any\r\nbenevolent person or society.\r\n\r\nTo the large charitable and correctional institutions of established\r\nreputation, to which children or pauper adults are committed by the\r\nlocal authorities, city money is appropriated on a business basis. A\r\nfixed sum is paid for the support of each committed person, and the\r\ntaxpayers may know what they are getting for their money. While the\r\ncity authorities can not regulate the expenses or salaries in these\r\ninstitutions, they know that the city is paying for a specific service\r\nand that the work is performed. That it might be done better or more\r\ncheaply need not concern them. But to the institutions and societies\r\nthat do not undertake to support dependent persons, but engage in\r\nindiscriminate charitable work, the giving of city money is as\r\ndoubtful a method of relieving the deserving poor as throwing coin in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of city money made for 1899 direct to two hundred\r\nand fifteen charitable and correctional institutions and societies\r\namounts to $1,784,846. The appropriations from the excise funds to\r\ninstitutions that support pauper children and adults will slightly\r\nexceed $1,000,000. The county of New York pays to State and private\r\ncharitable institutions for the same period the sum of $118,682; Kings\r\nCounty, $82,669; and Richmond County, $4,845; all of which comes out\r\nof the general treasury. The money received for licenses for theaters,\r\nconcert and music halls, amounting to $50,000 a year, is divided among\r\neighty-two private societies and institutions. This makes an aggregate\r\nof $3,000,000 paid out of the city treasury annually and expended\r\nunder the direction of private organizations. With the exception of\r\nless than $100,000 it is all appropriated under the provisions of\r\nspecial acts of the Legislature, or sections of the city charter, and\r\nthe city officers have no control whatever over the methods of\r\nexpenditure or the work undertaken by the societies that receive the\r\nmoney. Under such a system the possibilities for abuse of public\r\ncharity are well-nigh unlimited.\r\n\r\nThese direct appropriations of money do not represent all of the\r\ncity's contribution to the cause of charity. The property of all the\r\ncharitable institutions and societies is exempt from taxation and from\r\nassessments for public improvements. The tax commissioners report that\r\nthe assessed value of the property of such organizations is\r\n$70,781,990. At the present rate of taxation this means a loss to the\r\ncity of more than $1,400,000 a year. The assessments upon the same\r\nproperty for public improvements exceed $100,000 a year, which is paid\r\nby the city. These exemptions materially affect the tax rate as well\r\nas the bonded indebtedness and annual interest charges of the city, so\r\nthat the yearly contribution of the taxpayers of New York to charity\r\nis nearly if not quite $7,000,000, or about fifteen per cent of the\r\ndirect expenses of the city government.\r\n\r\nSome figures from the budget for 1899 will show the relative cost of\r\ncaring for the poor. The city will pay for public education\r\n$13,040,052; for police, $11,797,596; for the fire department,\r\n$4,443,664; for the health department, $1,110,538; for lighting,\r\n$2,000,000; for water, $1,450,817; for cleaning the streets,\r\n$4,575,800; for parks, $1,729,235; for paving and repaving streets,\r\n$2,520,099; and for charity direct and indirect, $7,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe chief abuses of the present system of public charity are the\r\nextravagant expenditures for salaries and the steady and rapid\r\nincrease of pauperism due to the misdirected efforts of the\r\ninexperienced persons who control so many of the smaller societies\r\nthat receive city money.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest and most important charitable organizations in the\r\ncity is the Children's Aid Society. The report of the treasurer for\r\n1898 shows the following expenditures:\r\n\r\n  Industrial schools--\r\n    Salaries of superintendent and teachers    $106,265.71\r\n    Rent of schoolrooms                           5,119.26\r\n    Books and school supplies                     5,178.54\r\n    Provisions                                    8,509.70\r\n    Clothing and special relief                   5,512.56\r\n    Fuel, gas, repairs, etc.                     20,497.88\r\n                                                 ---------\r\n  Sick Children's Mission                                    $655.48\r\n  Children's Summer Home                                    9,405.37\r\n  Health Home                                               8,307.45\r\n  Farm for Boys--Summer Charities                           2,719.59\r\n  Brace Memorial Lodging House                             12,914.13\r\n  Elizabeth Home for Girls                                 10,366.33\r\n  Tompkins Square Lodging House                             7,546.38\r\n  West Side Lodging House                                   9,079.26\r\n  East Side Lodging House                                   1,848.06\r\n  Forty fourth Street Lodging House                         7,948.56\r\n  Fogg Lodging House                                        1,942.26\r\n  Brace Farm School                                        12,150.64\r\n  Reading rooms                                               402.96\r\n  Medical examinations                                        312.00\r\n  Salaries, executive officers                              8,659.92\r\n  Immigration, fares, food, clothing, etc.                 30,162.69\r\n  Reinvestment, bonds sold                                 29,902.50\r\n  Amount due treasurer, November 1, 1898                      435.71\r\n  Printing, stationery, car fares, and incidental expenses  3,551.85\r\n                                                            --------\r\n                                                         $309,394.79\r\n\r\nThis shows a total salary account of $114,925.63, or about\r\nthirty-seven per cent of the expenditure. The society received from\r\nthe city $100,764, and from general subscriptions and donations\r\n$119,768. The balance of the income was derived from legacies,\r\nendowments, special trust funds, and sale of bonds.\r\n\r\nOne of the private institutions in the city for the instruction of\r\ndeaf-mutes receives city, State, and county pupils under the\r\nprovisions of special acts of the Legislature. The report of the\r\ntreasurer for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1898, shows the\r\nfollowing receipts:\r\n\r\n  Balance on hand, October 1, 1897                $2,885.03\r\n  New York State                                  44,216.74\r\n  New York County                                 27,179.54\r\n  Kings County                                    12,697.05\r\n  Queens County                                    1,217.19\r\n  Westchester County                               1,060.94\r\n  Various other counties                           2,727.02\r\n  Paying pupils                                      791.75\r\n  Donations                                       11,754.46\r\n  All other sources                                  613.89\r\n                                                   --------\r\n                                                $105,143.61\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for the same period were $102,570.64, of which\r\n$33,613.56 was for salaries and wages. This is a private institution\r\nexempt from city or State control, subject to no governmental\r\nsupervision except examination by the State Board of Charities, yet\r\nninety per cent of its income is public money, and almost one third of\r\nthe cost of maintenance is charged to salaries and wages. These two\r\ncases are mentioned not in criticism of the work or methods of the\r\ninstitutions, but as representing a fair average of the salary account\r\nof all the larger private charitable societies. They also fairly\r\nrepresent the two extremes in the source of their income, one\r\nreceiving ninety per cent of public money, the other a little more\r\nthan thirty per cent.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations conducted by the city comptroller and\r\nsupplemented by the agents of the State Board of Charities disclose\r\nabuses in the expenditure of public money by certain small societies\r\nso flagrant that the appropriations for the current year have been\r\nwithheld. In these cases the salary account was always the chief\r\nexpenditure, but it was also discovered that whatever relief got\r\nbeyond the headquarters of the societies went to professional beggars,\r\nwho had no difficulty in deceiving the persons in charge. It was found\r\nthat persons in good health had lived comfortably for months, perhaps\r\nfor years, on public charity dispensed through private organizations.\r\nThese professional beggars would obtain food at one place, clothing at\r\nanother, coal at a third, small sums of money from all three perhaps,\r\nthen reverse the order of application or appeal to newer organizations\r\nif detection threatened. Relief was extended in many instances with\r\nlittle or no effort on the part of the societies to ascertain the\r\nmerits of a case or the honesty of an applicant.\r\n\r\nOne small society was found to have expended practically all of the\r\nmoney received from the city in the payment of the living expenses of\r\nthe person who had the entire management of the organization. The\r\ncharitable work of a year consisted in the distribution of a small\r\nquantity of cast-off clothing and a few bushels of potatoes. The\r\nreports of the society contained the names of directors who had never\r\nserved and knew nothing of the true condition of the organization.\r\nThey had merely consented that their names might be used as a\r\nguarantee of reliability and to aid in the work of soliciting\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nOne case has been found where a mother and daughter lived comfortably\r\nby selling coal given to them by charitable societies. One private\r\ninstitution, now abolished, boarded committed children and received\r\ntwo dollars a week from the city for each child. The children were fed\r\non fish and potatoes at a cost of forty-four cents each per week.\r\nAfter these facts were discovered the city authorities could not\r\nremove the children until the Board of Health condemned and closed the\r\nbuilding under the provisions of the sanitary code. The minor abuses\r\nin the way of aiding undeserving persons extend to nearly all the\r\nprivate societies that receive city money. Those that exercise care\r\nand have been long established are often deceived by professional\r\nbeggars.\r\n\r\nAfter his investigation of the subject the city comptroller\r\nestablished in his office a bureau of examination for the purpose of\r\nplacing a check on the many small societies that indulge in\r\nindiscriminate charity at the expense of the city, but he soon found\r\nthat he was powerless to correct all abuses. The present condition can\r\nnot be corrected and public charity placed upon a practical basis and\r\nlimited to the real necessities of the deserving poor until the city\r\ngovernment begins to deal with each society and institution upon its\r\nmerits. Changes and reforms to the present system will come in time,\r\nbut progress will be slow because charity is a valid excuse at the bar\r\nof public opinion for the reckless expenditure of city money, and for\r\nthat reason it appeals strongly to the average politician and\r\nlawmaker. Charity will cover with a mantle of commendation a multitude\r\nof abuses and crave pardon for gross frauds. It is the pastime of the\r\nrich and their gratuity to the poor. The magic of the word seems to\r\nmove a Legislature and open the treasure vaults of city and State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALASKA AND THE KLONDIKE.\r\n\r\nA JOURNEY TO THE NEW ELDORADO.\r\n\r\nBY ANGELO HEILPRIN,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY AT THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF\r\nPHILADELPHIA, FELLOW OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--SAN FRANCISCO OF THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAWSON AND KLONDIKE CITY (SOUTH DAWSON) IN SEPTEMBER,\r\n1898.]\r\n\r\nA first impression of Dawson, in August, 1898, could not be other than\r\none calculated to bring up comparisons with strange and foreign lands.\r\nAs we saw it, approaching from the water side, it persistently\r\nsuggested the banks of the Yang-tse-kiang, or of some other Chinese\r\nriver, on which a densely apportioned population had settled.\r\nHundreds--one is almost tempted to say thousands--of boats were lined\r\nup against the river front, and so packed in rows back of one another\r\nthat exit from the inner line was made possible only by a passive\r\naccommodation from the outside. There were steam craft, house-boats,\r\nscows, and a variety of minor bottoms, ranging from the hay-packed\r\nraft to the graceful Peterboro canoe. Many had canvas spread over\r\nthem, giving house quarter to those who preferred the economy of an\r\nowned estate to the high-priced cabins of log huts and hotels, and\r\nthe purity of the open air to what was at least considered to be the\r\npolluted atmosphere of the stable city. It would be far from the truth\r\nto assume that this floating population was composed exclusively of\r\nmen, women, and children; there were dogs galore, abundant by both\r\npresence and voice, horses and mules, and an occasional goat betrayed\r\nitself munching among hay-packs and the usual combination of simple\r\nand hard things which make up goat food. One canvas bore the tempting\r\ninscription \"Hot and Cold River Baths,\" several carried legends of\r\nvariously designated laundries, and a few even invited to \"Board and\r\nLodging, Cheap.\" Of course, the word cheap had here a special\r\netymologic significance, and bore little relation to the same form of\r\nword which is current in lexicons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME MUD IN THE MAIN STREET--FIRST AVENUE.]\r\n\r\nThe first favorable impression of dry land in Dawson was tempered by a\r\nknowledge that even here were many moist spots. The mud lay in great\r\npools along the main street--First Avenue or Front Street--but hardly\r\nin sufficient depth to make walking dangerous. Dogs and goats could\r\nalone drown in it. It is true that an occasional wading burro or even\r\na mule would find a dangerously low level, but I am not aware that any\r\nin this condition had added to a list of serious casualties. No\r\nmention is made in this connection of cats, for, in truth, only two\r\nspecimens of the feline family had up to this time reached\r\nDawson--one, a blue-ribboned kitten, which was endearingly received as\r\nthe mascot of the Yukon Mining Exchange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAIN STREET IN A SPRING FRESHET.]\r\n\r\nThe Dawsonites are not entirely oblivious to the discomforts of mud,\r\nfor an effort is being made to block it out with sawdust, of which the\r\nthree or four sawmills in the town furnish a goodly supply. In some\r\nparts a rough corduroy has been attempted, but the price of lumber,\r\ntwo hundred dollars per thousand linear feet, renders this form of\r\nconstruction too expensive for general use, especially in a community\r\nall of whose members, female as well as male, are prepared to stem the\r\ntide with high-top boots. About one half the street length shows the\r\npretense of wooden sidewalks, but no one has yet recognized a special\r\nresponsibility for repairs, or seemingly considered that a continuous\r\nwalk requires a continuous support. Walking is a succession of ups and\r\ndowns; boards are missing here, other are smashed elsewhere, and the\r\nwhole walk gives the impression of having been in existence for\r\ncenturies rather than for the period of a short twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to determine what, perhaps, the majority of the\r\nsixteen thousand inhabitants of Dawson were doing at the time of our\r\narrival. They were simply loitering, and the streets were packed with\r\nhumanity. This was not strange, either, for it must have been\r\ndifficult to resist the enjoyment of that open sunshine, that soft,\r\nwarm atmosphere which is the delight of the summer climate of the far\r\nNorth. Never had I experienced anything comparable, and others who had\r\ntraveled much agreed with my experience. On my way to the hotel, the\r\n\"Fair View,\" which had been strongly recommended for its _cuisine_ and\r\nthe circumstance that it was \"brand\" new in its appointments--having\r\nonly come into existence a few days before--I caught a good general\r\nglimpse of the town, the dominant features of which were registered\r\nin the two sides of the main thoroughfare along the river front. A\r\nnearly continuous row of one-story, or at the utmost two-story, frame\r\nshacks or booths, many of them still in canvas form, and most of them\r\nsupported over the river's bank by pile proppings, built up the river\r\nside of this First Avenue. All manner of articles, both serviceable\r\nand unserviceable, for the Klondike business were displayed, mostly\r\nin cramped quarters. The variety of things that had in so brief a\r\nperiod found their way to this region was truly astonishing, and one\r\nmarveled at the mental ingenuity which spirited some of these articles\r\nto a _champ de vente_. Surely nothing but \"manifest destiny\" could\r\nhave placed a mammoth's molar on sale for a hundred dollars, when it\r\nwas thought that a period of starvation was reigning in the town. And\r\nyet almost alongside of it were posters announcing that four loaves of\r\nbread could be purchased for one dollar--in another place \"six loves\"\r\nfor the same price--and that \"half an ounce\" of gold dust, the\r\nequivalent of eight dollars, would gain admission to the best seat\r\nwitnessing a boxing and wrestling contest.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the booths doing a regular merchandise business, there\r\nwere those whose masters ministered to a specialty--druggists and\r\ndoctors, photographers, auctioneers, and brokers of one kind or\r\nanother. \"Bartlett Bros., Packers\" served the inner core of the gold\r\nregions by means of long trains of pack-mules, but they were not the\r\nonly ones to whom the _cargador_ was an officer militant. Dog teams\r\nthere were as well as mule teams, and the majesty of the law was\r\nhardly considered invaded when the former effected a junction with man\r\nin the capacity of common carriers. One of the most interesting sights\r\nwas to me the large number of letters awaiting ownership which were\r\ntacked up to the fronts and sides of different buildings, in the most\r\npublic way petitioning for rapid delivery. My first letter in Dawson\r\nwas obtained by stripping it from a door-jamb, but it was three weeks\r\nbefore my attention had been directed to it by a friendly discoverer.\r\nTo obtain anything from the post office was a most exhaustive process,\r\nand usually required a long wait, sometimes of a day, or even of two\r\ndays, before entry could be obtained into the small room where the\r\nsorting, distribution, and dispensation of mail matter were being\r\neffected. Even when finally issued, this matter was usually of several\r\nweeks' antiquity of arrival, the sorting of tons of substance being\r\nmuch beyond the capacity of the few official hands that were engaged\r\nin the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOG-TEAM EXPRESS--DAWSON.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most imposing side of the street was that which faced the\r\nriver. Here, at least, were real buildings. The stately depots of the\r\nAlaska Commercial and North America Trading and Transportation\r\nCompanies, with their outer casing of corrugated iron, would have done\r\ncredit to a town of larger capacity than Dawson, and in regions much\r\nmore accessible to civilization than the Northwest Territory. Farther\r\non, the signs of a number of well-built saloons--\"The Dominion,\" \"The\r\nPioneer,\" etc.--attract attention, not by the supposition that they\r\nare alone in the business, since they are supported by probably not\r\nless than two or three score others of their kind, but by their\r\nspecially distinctive interiors; one of these is embellished inside by\r\na series of four mural decorations in oil or distemper, representing a\r\nrange of subject from Morro Castle, Havana, to a \"Moonlight on the\r\nYukon,\" for which a resident artist \"of promise,\" whose work was done\r\nin an open lot, received the handsome compensation of eight hundred\r\ndollars. They were befitting the place which they graced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNCTION OF THE KLONDIKE WITH THE YUKON.]\r\n\r\nA more intimate acquaintance with these saloons made it plain that\r\nthey were patronized both for the drinks which were sold over the bar\r\nfor fifty cents or more and for the gaming tables which in open\r\nevidence betrayed a surpassingly strong interest in faro, _rouge et\r\nnoir_, and roulette. Crowds were watching the fortunes of the play at\r\nevery turn. From the front entrance quite to the rear some of the more\r\nfavored halls were packed, but with an element that seemed little\r\ndisposed to disturbance of any kind. While the drinking of spirituous\r\nliquors is very largely indulged in, I believe that during all my stay\r\nin Dawson only three cases of obtrusive drunkenness were brought to my\r\nattention; and of riotism my experience was wholly negative. Life and\r\nproperty are considered safe even in the most doubtful establishments,\r\nand it is not uncommon for a man to pass hours in a crowded dance hall\r\nwith virtually all his possessions, possibly a few hundred dollars, or\r\nit may be thousands, carried in the form of gold dust in his trousers\r\npockets. Two main factors are involved in this condition of security\r\nor in the feeling that it exists. The first of these is, perhaps, a\r\nwholesome dread of the Canadian Mounted Police, whose efficiency in\r\nthe direction of controlling order is conceded by every one; and the\r\nsecond, the circumstance that the inhabitants of Dawson and of the\r\nadjoining Klondike region are not, as is so largely supposed, a mere\r\nassortment of rough prospectors, intent upon doing anything for the\r\nsake of acquiring gold, but a fair representation of good and\r\nindifferent elements borrowed from all professions and stations of\r\nlife, and not from one country alone, but from nearly all parts of the\r\ncivilized globe. During my brief stay I stumbled upon \"counts,\"\r\n\"sirs,\" military and naval officers, scientists, lawyers, newspaper\r\nmen, promoters, and others of broad and liberal standing; and if some\r\nof these were undistinguishable in external garb from their brethren\r\nin mustard-colored mackinaws whose sole resource was digging for gold,\r\ntheir polished and intellectual method was evidence enough that\r\ncivilization was present in good quantity along the upper Yukon. The\r\nfact that there are three weekly newspapers published in Dawson--the\r\nNugget, Midnight Sun, and Dawson Miner, the first two selling for\r\nfifty cents a copy and the last for twenty-five cents--can hardly be\r\nconsidered to prove this condition, although favoring it; for, though\r\nthe substance and especially the typography of the journals are quite\r\ngood, the demand for reading matter is such that almost anything could\r\nrealize a subscription list. The long-belated New York journals seem\r\nto command a steady sale on the news stands, where one also sees\r\ndisplayed the small and (in our country) gratuitously distributed\r\nscenic book of the transcontinental railways put up for fifty cents.\r\nThe Argosy, Strand, Munsey's, and Cosmopolitan were the ruling\r\nmagazines during my visit, and each of these could be had for\r\nseventy-five cents a number.\r\n\r\nRegretfully must it be said that the female portion of the population\r\ndoes not sustain the male either in character or diversity. I tried\r\nin various ways to ascertain the number of women who represented the\r\ncommunity, but failed to obtain a satisfactory accounting. A large\r\nproportion of those who are in evidence, and perhaps even by far the\r\ngreater number, belong to the \"red\" aristocracy, or at least to that\r\nside where steady principles are treated with little consideration and\r\nrespect. I use the word aristocracy advisedly, for it is a notorious\r\nfact that an amount of deference is paid to these creatures of shame\r\nwhich is not given to the virtuous or self-respecting woman; and that\r\nthey themselves, recognizing their standing, are apt to look down upon\r\nthe rest of their kin, and to even question their proper privileges. A\r\nlarge part of the broadly capacious Second Avenue, together with\r\nequally conspicuous sections of the town elsewhere, is given up to the\r\npublic display of the inmates of neatly constructed log cabins bearing\r\nsuch devices as \"Saratoga,\" \"Bon-Ton,\" \"The Lucky Cigar Store,\" \"Green\r\nTree,\" etc. The number of open houses is probably less than in most\r\nmining camps, and far below what it is in some places. In deference to\r\na demand tax of fifty dollars, levied on each member of the profession\r\nto pay part costs of two fire engines which had been brought to the\r\ntown, there was a response of only sixty-nine, and this was considered\r\na sufficiently close representation not to press the matter any\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nA community of this kind must necessarily have its dance halls and\r\nplaces of amusement. The latter consisted at the time of my arrival of\r\nfour \"theatres\" or \"opera houses\"--the \"Combination,\" \"Monte Carlo,\"\r\n\"Mascot,\" and \"Pavilion,\" two of which suspended or closed up before\r\nthe \"season\" had fairly opened. Ordinarily, the price of a drink at\r\nthe bar of entrance paid for admission to the performance with seat,\r\nand many will agree with me in believing that the admission was fully\r\npaid. The acting need not be worse at any theater, and the singing\r\ncould hardly be surpassed in its eccentricities; yet the performances\r\nappeared to satisfy a general demand, as ordinarily the houses were\r\npacked to their full capacity evening after evening. Needless is it to\r\nsay that the performances are not intended for women in good standing,\r\nand few such are ever present, unless heavily screened behind the\r\ncurtains of the \"boxes.\" The plays are all of a low order, but the\r\nworst is not much worse than some of the plays that are tolerated in\r\nall their nastiness in some of our own legitimate theaters. It is\r\nsingular and interesting as showing the influence of necessity that a\r\nsacred Sunday concert in aid of the fire department was successfully\r\ncarried through in the capacious halls of one of the most notorious\r\ndancing resorts.\r\n\r\nThere are now two banks in Dawson--the Bank of British North America\r\nand the Canadian Bank of Commerce. In the early days of August the\r\nfirst of these was still housed in a tent, and before the end of the\r\nmonth a stately wooden structure with flagstaff, and with commodious\r\nquarters for the representing officers and accountants, gave dignity\r\nto the institution, while it lent style to the corner upon which it\r\nwas erected. Adjoining it now is the architecturally most imposing but\r\nby no means largest building in Dawson--the three-storied,\r\nbow-windowed log cabin of Alexander McDonald, the recognized \"King of\r\nthe Klondike\"--intended primarily as an office building. It is a truly\r\nfine expression of the art of log-cabin building. In many ways one of\r\nthe most interesting buildings, if such it can be called, was the air\r\nspace, with canvas top, which adjoined one of the theaters and was\r\nused by Signor Gandolfo for a fruit store. There was no architectural\r\nquality to commend this space; nor, indeed, was there anything else in\r\nits favor, except that it was in the right place and brought both\r\nlessor and lessee fortunes. For the privileges of this space of five\r\nfeet width the occupant paid the handsome rental of one hundred and\r\ntwenty dollars a month, or twenty-four dollars per single foot of\r\nfrontage; his profits were, however, such as to justify this payment,\r\nand before leaving he confided to me his plan of renting one half of\r\nthe establishment. Conceive of the character of a store five feet\r\nwide, the opposite sides of which are devoted to quite distinct\r\ninterests! Other sites rent for very little less, and the singular\r\npart of it is that much of the rental goes to the pockets of certain\r\nassumed owners, whose actual rights are largely in the nature of a\r\n\"grab\" or of squatter sovereignty alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRIVAL OF THE \"SUSIE\" FROM \"DOWN THE RIVER.\"]\r\n\r\nDawson extends up the river for about two miles, virtually coalescing\r\nwith and taking in what has been euphoniously called Lousetown and\r\nalso Klondike City. These more southerly parts carry with them certain\r\ncharacteristics which are either wanting in the main city or are there\r\nbut feebly represented. The closely packed tents remind one of an army\r\ngathering or of the furniture of some religious camp meeting; walking\r\nbetween them might almost be considered to be a branch of navigation.\r\nInscriptions on the canvas tell us of certain \"brothers from St.\r\nLouis\" being occupants here, and of \"the Jolly Four from----\"\r\noccupants elsewhere. Representatives of the press, physicians, and\r\nattorneys all have their inscriptions. But the most interesting\r\nconstructions, picturesque as much as they are instructive, are the\r\nelevated platform _caches_, diminutive log cabins, which on high\r\nstilts store a multitude of articles in safe keeping and beyond reach\r\nof the army of hungry dogs which are everywhere prowling about and\r\ncarousing upon all manner of odds and ends. Their appearance,\r\nespecially where they are placed among trees and bushes, is such that\r\nthe observer can hardly resist the feeling that he is traveling in a\r\nregion of primitive pile-dwellings--it may be the interior of New\r\nGuinea or the forest tract of one of the Guianas.\r\n\r\nDawson, which now owns the right to celebrate its third anniversary,\r\nis destined before long to assume a modern garb. It already has its\r\nelectric plant, and before many months have passed electric\r\nillumination will lift the burden of the dark winter night. It is\r\nbelieved, too, that an electric railroad for freight and passenger\r\nservice will be constructed in the course of the present year into the\r\nheart of the adjoining gold region. The tiresome accounts of bad\r\ntrails will then be a thing of the past. In its business aspects\r\nDawson does not materially differ from the majority of the boom towns\r\nof the United States, though of course it has its peculiarities. In\r\nthe period of little more than a year it has gathered to itself,\r\nbesides the usual class of merchants, representatives of a number of\r\nprofessions, such as doctors, lawyers, chemists, and assayers, most of\r\nwhom, especially of the first two classes, appeared to be doing at\r\nleast fairly well. Mine brokers, or simply venders of claims, are\r\nnumerous, but their service does not in most cases sustain confidence;\r\nthe display of posters announcing \"bonanzas\" in mining properties may\r\nbe effective at times, but ordinarily the investor turns either to the\r\nMining Exchange, a reasonably well-conducted private enterprise, or to\r\nclaim-holders on the ground. The auction of claims at the Exchange was\r\nalways largely attended at the times of my visits, and the bidding was\r\nfrequently very spirited. The allowance of a time limit of ten days in\r\nwhich to make an examination of properties purchased and of the titles\r\nthereto before payment, beyond a forfeit of ten per cent, was exacted,\r\nnaturally inspired confidence in the method of the transaction, and\r\nthere is no question that a considerable number of good properties\r\nwere parted over the boards here, and with eminent satisfaction to the\r\npurchasers.\r\n\r\nThe practice of medicine is necessarily governed by the laws which are\r\nin effect in the Dominion of Canada, and it requires the possession on\r\nthe part of the practitioner of a diploma properly accredited from\r\nsome recognized college of medicine in Canada. Graduation with diploma\r\nfrom the best medical schools in the United States is not considered\r\nto meet the requirement--nor, for that matter, is the diploma of any\r\nbut a British school. This restriction also applies in the case of\r\nprofessional trained nurses. A number of cases closely bordering on\r\nlitigation, and at one time even threatening to bring about\r\ninternational complications, have arisen in connection with practice\r\nviolating this law; but despite the overwhelmingly large number of\r\nforeigners who are resident in the region, and who, it was thought by\r\nsome, had the right to consult practitioners of their own nationality\r\nor choice, there is now a peaceful submission to the reading of the\r\nstatute. The exaction is in no way intended to legislate against\r\nforeigners, but is simply a provision of the Dominion laws, similar to\r\nthat which requires a \"Dominion surveyor\" who intends doing official\r\nsurvey work in British Columbia to be properly accredited with a\r\nspecial paper of that section of Canada (as distinguished from the\r\nNorthwest Territory, etc.). Like the physicians, all surveyors giving\r\nout work under their names must be officially licensed from the\r\nDominion, although those not thus certificated are permitted to do\r\noffice or field work for others who are.\r\n\r\nA field of labor that has already been entered upon by women is\r\nstenography and typewriting. There has been considerable demand for\r\nthis kind of work, and there will continue to be much more, but it\r\nmay be doubted if profits arising from it will ever equal what has\r\nbeen attained in millinery and the sale of fancy dress goods. One of\r\nthe earliest milliners to come out of Dawson told me at Bennett that\r\nshe had disposed of a hat which brought her two hundred and eighty\r\ndollars (in April, 1898), and its only ornamentation was two black\r\nostrich feathers! Such prices are to-day a thing away in the past, but\r\nfur capes or circulars are still marketable for three hundred dollars\r\nand upward.\r\n\r\nToward a more intimate acquaintance with the methods and lines of\r\nbusiness now followed in Dawson we subjoin a facsimile of portions of\r\nthe advertising page of the Yukon Midnight Sun, bearing date of\r\nSeptember 3, 1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF PART OF YUKON MIDNIGHT SUN, SEPTEMBER 3,\r\n1898.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO QUESTION.\r\n\r\nBY J. L. M. CURRY, LL.D.,\r\n\r\nGENERAL AGENT OF THE PEABODY EDUCATION FUND AND OF THE JOHN F. SLATER\r\nEDUCATION FUND; LATE MINISTER TO SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negro question is not of recent origin. The Iliad of our woes\r\nbegan in 1620, when negroes were first brought to the colony of\r\nVirginia and sold as slaves. Slavery antedates history. The traffic of\r\nEuropeans in negroes existed a half century before the discovery of\r\nAmerica. The very year in which Charles V sailed with a powerful\r\nexpedition against Tunis to check the piracies of the Barbary states,\r\nand to emancipate enslaved Christians in Africa, he gave an open legal\r\nsanction to the African slave trade. When independence was declared in\r\n1776 all the colonies held slaves. Slavery, said the late Senator\r\nIngalls, disappeared from the Northern States \"by the operation of\r\nsocial, economic, and natural laws,\" and \"the North did not finally\r\ndetermine to destroy this system until convinced that its continuance\r\nthreatened not only their industrial independence but their political\r\nimportance.\" In course of years \"the peculiar institution\" assumed a\r\nsectional character. The war between the States precipitated a crisis.\r\nPresident Lincoln began then the work of emancipation. \"As\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy in time of war, I suppose I\r\nhave the right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy....\r\nI view the measure [the Proclamation] as a practical war measure\r\naccording to the advantages or disadvantages it will offer to the\r\nsuppression of the rebellion.\" Senator Ingalls's testimony is as\r\nfollows: \"It may be admitted that the emancipation of the slaves was\r\nnot contemplated by any considerable portion of the American people\r\nwhen the war for the Union began, and it was not brought to pass until\r\nthe fortunes of war became desperate, and was then justified and\r\ndefended upon the plea of military necessity.\" The Southern States\r\nratified the amendments to the Constitution under penalty of otherwise\r\nremaining out of the Union and in political and military vassalage.\r\nThe abolition of slavery has the assent of all sane men. Apart from\r\nethical considerations, the subjection of the will, thought, or labor\r\nof a mature human being to the whim, caprice, or legal right of\r\nanother is a gross political and economical blunder, unwise and\r\nindefensible. After emancipation came citizenship and enfranchisement\r\nof the freedmen, and the punitive measures of reconstruction, which\r\nwere the outcome of hatred, revenge, desire for party ascendency, and\r\nwhich no good man can now approve. No conquering nation ever inflicted\r\non a conquered people more cruel injustice than the disfranchisement\r\nof the most capable citizens and the enfranchisement of liberated\r\nslaves. Certain great civil rights are the necessary and proper\r\nconsequences of freedom. Suffrage is not a natural right, nor a legal,\r\npolitical, or general result of freedom or citizenship. The large\r\nmajority of citizens do not and can not vote.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of millions of slaves was the most gigantic and, in\r\nitself, one of the most beneficent acts of this century. Nothing is\r\ncomparable to it as a triumph of the inalienable rights of man.\r\nHumanity and justice demanded emancipation. Re-enslavement no one\r\nproposes or desires. All would rejoice in the prosperity and progress\r\nof the Afro-American, but with freedom came citizenship and suffrage,\r\nand these revolutionized our Government. Elements undreamed of were\r\nintroduced as constituents. When the Constitution and the resulting\r\nUnion were formed, such a citizenship with franchise was not proposed,\r\nand if proposed would not have been listened to for a moment. The most\r\ninfatuated negrophilist would not stultify himself by asserting that\r\nthe Union of States would or could have been consummated with the\r\npresent incongruous, heterogeneous citizenship.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other facts has been evolved what has been called the\r\nnegro problem. In the discussion, it is best to eliminate all\r\nextraneous considerations, all issues which, as the lawyers say, are\r\n\"_dehors_ the record.\" Government is a very practical business. The\r\nend is the securing and preserving the peace, safety, and well-being\r\nof the State. Civil government has no mission of general philanthropy.\r\nThis problem, while of terrific importance in the South, where the\r\nblack population is persistently congestive, is not, in its\r\nramifications or direct effects, local or sectional. It affects every\r\ncommunity and every section. It is of paramount national importance,\r\ncomplex, and involving social, moral, and political considerations.\r\nIts gravity can not be exaggerated. It compels the attention and\r\ndemands all the resources of patriots, philanthropists, statesmen. It\r\nthrusts itself, uninvited and unwelcomed, into religious and social\r\nassemblies and legislative councils. It is pervasive, continuing,\r\nvital. It is better to look it full in the face and give it\r\ndispassionate thought.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be said that in this discussion no hostile reference\r\nis made to individuals. Some negroes are men of intelligence,\r\nintegrity, patriotism, and stand on a plane with our best citizens in\r\nvirtues and mental qualifications.[C] The gist of this contention is\r\nnot based on special exceptions, but on the race in the aggregate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Such an extraordinary man as Booker T. Washington is an\r\nhonor to any country and worthy of unlimited confidence and regard.]\r\n\r\nWe find in the South the presence of two distinct peoples, with\r\nirreconcilable racial characteristics and diverse historical\r\nantecedents. The Caucasian and the negro are not simply unlike, but\r\nthey are contrasted, and are as far apart as any other two races of\r\nhuman beings. They are unassimilable and immiscible without rapid\r\ndegeneracy. Ethnologically they are nearly polar opposites. With the\r\nCaucasian progress has been upward. Whatever is great in art,\r\ninvention, literature, science, civilization, religion, has\r\ncharacterized him. In his native land the negro has made little or no\r\nadvancement for nearly four thousand years. Surrounded by and in\r\ncontact with a higher civilization, he has not invented a machine, nor\r\npainted a picture, nor written a book, nor organized a stable\r\ngovernment, nor constructed a code of laws. He has not suppressed the\r\nslave trade, which, according to recent testimony, was never more\r\nflourishing. He has no monuments nor recorded history. For thousands\r\nof years there lies behind the race one dreary, unrelieved, monotonous\r\nchapter of ignorance, nakedness, superstition, savagery. All efforts\r\nto reclaim, civilize, Christianize, have been disastrous failures,\r\nexcept what has been accomplished in this direction in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt need not be disguised, for it is the ever-present, indisputable\r\nfact, that while there are alleviations of the unpleasantness, the\r\nrelations between the negroes and their co-citizens of the Caucasian\r\nrace are strained and unsatisfactory. The friction, the prejudice, the\r\ncleavage, is not between Teutonic and Latin on the one side and\r\nSemitic on the other, nor between Saxon and Celt; it lies deeper,\r\nyields less readily to palliatives and remedies, and seems a matter of\r\nadjustment for the remotest future. It may help to understand the\r\nsituation if we analyze its causes.\r\n\r\nThe great revolution suddenly transformed the customs, traditions, and\r\nconditions of the two races. Ownership gave way to freedom; compulsory\r\nand wage-unrewarded labor to absolute control of person; inequality,\r\ninferiority, subjection, to equality in the eye of the law; restrained\r\nlocomotion to license of movement; kindness, interest in life, wealth,\r\nand physical welfare, to suspicion, distress, alienation. With\r\nproperty in man, regulated and enforced by laws in the interest of the\r\nmaster, labor was organized, directed by intelligent control to the\r\ndevelopment of agricultural resources and to the building up of a\r\nsociety which for refinement of manners, hospitality, and\r\nadministrative capacity, has elicited praise from disinterested\r\ntravelers and investigators. The negro, whatever he may have attained\r\nfrom the discipline of slavery, was not cultivated in intelligence, in\r\nmanual skill, in forethought, power of initiative, in thrift, and the\r\ncomforts and graces of home life. When freed, many were deluded by\r\ndeceptive promises. They construed freedom to mean a division of\r\nproperty. Release from bondage led to intemperance and extravagance.\r\nAccustomed to control, unaccustomed to self-reliance, having others\r\nto think, plan, buy, and sell for them, to supply wants, to watch over\r\nthem from the cradle to the coffin, many, when left to themselves,\r\nreverted to primitive habits, and became idle and worthless. Slavery\r\nhad cursed the South with ignorant, unskilled, uninventive labor.\r\nFreedom did not change its character. The war, liberation of slaves,\r\nthe sudden extinguishment of millions of property, bankrupted the\r\nSouth. Subsistence, recovery of means of living, rehabilitation,\r\nreorganization of those agencies, which are, with intelligent work,\r\nthe chief means of the wealth of civilized peoples, became the first\r\nduty after hostilities ceased. This demanded steady, persistent\r\nindustry, the change of former methods of agriculture, subdivision of\r\nfarms, diversification of pursuits, opening of academies and colleges,\r\nand establishment of public schools for free and universal education.\r\nThe contrast between the wealth and prosperity of the North and South\r\npresents an appalling picture. Naturally, the Southern people were in\r\ndespair, and too often they vented their dissatisfaction, their rage,\r\nupon the irresponsible and unoffending negro.\r\n\r\nSlavery _per se_ is not conducive to self-restraint of the enslaved,\r\nto high ethical standards, and the best types of human life. When the\r\ninterest and authority of owners were removed and former religious\r\ninstruction was crippled or withdrawn, the negroes fell rapidly from\r\nwhat had been attained in slavery to a state of immorality, and, in\r\nsome cases, to original fetichism. Some remained immovable in their\r\nformer faith, but many, especially of the younger generation, of both\r\nsexes, gave proof of what degeneracy can accomplish in a quarter of a\r\ncentury. It is very common for them to divorce religion and piety.\r\nArtificial excitement, passionate emotion, was substituted for a faith\r\nwhich should be the product of a knowledge of and deep reverence for\r\nthe Word of God. The danger of doing harm, or injustice, restrains my\r\npen from disclosing a mass of disgusting material which could only\r\nshock sensibilities and stagger credulity. It is, besides, very easy\r\nto magnify our own virtues and others' vices. It is a prevalent mode\r\nof religiousness to repent of other people's sins, and to get\r\nsuperfluous merit by showing how others fall short of our attainments.\r\nLowell said, \"Everybody has a mission (with a capital M) to attend to\r\neverybody else's business,\" and \"to make his own whim the law, and his\r\nown range the horizon of the universe.\" We have all read of the\r\nphilanthropic Mrs. Jelliby neglecting home and children to sweeten the\r\nlot of the unregenerate natives of Borrioboola Gha. Still, testimony,\r\nto satisfy the most skeptical, could be adduced _ad nauseam_, from men\r\nand women doing educational and missionary work among the colored\r\npeople, to show the deplorable depths into which multitudes have\r\nsunk.\r\n\r\nUnder the Reconstruction Acts there was a deliberate, predetermined\r\nattempt and purpose to put the freedmen in control of the Southern\r\nStates. The late slaves were enfranchised; the best class of white men\r\nwere disfranchised. The law presumes that a man or a State intends the\r\nlogical consequence of acts done. In South Carolina, Mississippi, and\r\nLouisiana a majority of the voters, under the coerced policy, were\r\nnegroes. In other States they were so numerous that a combination with\r\na small fraction of white voters would give the ascendency. In\r\nVirginia, a coalition between non-taxpaying white people and negroes,\r\nunder skilled and bold leadership, accomplished partial repudiation of\r\nthe State debt. Superadd to this undisguised Federal intent the hungry\r\nadventurers who, as governors, judges, marshals, district attorneys,\r\netc., flocked like vultures around the carcass, the horde of persons\r\nwhose object was to pilfer and plunder, who played upon the ignorance,\r\nthe superstitions, and gratitude of the negro and made the credulous\r\nvictims believe that their former masters were not to be trusted in\r\nelections, and you have a picture which imagination fails to realize.\r\nThe negroes, neither by apprenticeship, nor political education, not\r\nintellectual culture, were prepared for the boon, and their\r\nunscrupulous friends organized them into secret societies and inflamed\r\nhopes and expectations of wealth and dominancy. Casper Hauser\r\ntransferred from a dungeon to a throne would be a fit illustration of\r\nthis defiance of all the teachings of the past. Suffrage was a wrong\r\nto the nation, to the States, to the white and black races, and\r\nespecially to the negro. Negro suffrage is a farce, a burlesque on\r\nelections, and only evil. The negroes generally vote as puppets, as\r\nmachines, and have not the remotest conception of the character or\r\neffect of the act they are ignorantly performing, or of the issues\r\ninvolved in the contest, or of the functions or duties of the officers\r\nvoted for. Huxley says, \"Voting power as a means of giving effect to\r\nopinion is more likely to prove a curse than a blessing to the voter,\r\nunless that opinion is the result of a sound judgment operating upon\r\nsound knowledge.\" This premature investiture of the negro with\r\nsuffrage reciprocally provoked alienation, bitterness, strife, and a\r\nresolute purpose on the part of the white people not to submit to the\r\nmisrule and tyranny of ignorance and pauperism, but to resort to all\r\nnecessary methods to defeat such a result.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to recapitulate the facts of many thousand years in\r\norder to raise the inference of racial difference between the\r\nCaucasian and the negro. The immigration to our country is the proof\r\nof antagonism of races. The foreigner stays away from the South; so in\r\na large degree does the Northern man. Notwithstanding the unsurpassed\r\nclimate, the rivers and gulf and mountains, the fertile soil, the\r\nvaried products, the hospitable welcome, the territory occupied by the\r\nnegro is persistently avoided. By the census of 1880 the proportion of\r\nforeign-born in all the former slave States was 3.5 per cent; in the\r\nNorthern States about twenty per cent; in eight Southern States, where\r\nthe negroes abound, there was in 1880 only one and a third per cent\r\nwho were of foreign birth. Mr. Lincoln, in 1858, in accounting for the\r\nrepulsion, said: \"There is a physical difference between the two races\r\nwhich will probably forbid their living together upon the footing of\r\nperfect equality.... I am not, or ever have been, in favor of making\r\nvoters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office,\r\nnor of intermarrying with white people.\" Absorption, assimilation, is\r\nnot to be dreamed of. The negro is no nearer common fellowship,\r\nequality of association, than he was in 1865. Reconstruction measures,\r\nconstitutional amendments, sword and bayonet, ecclesiastical\r\nanathemas, fulminations of press and pulpit, all power of church and\r\nstate and public opinion, have not altered, can not alter, what seems\r\nineradicable. Race antagonism reaches deeper than political\r\naffiliation. If every negro at the South were to vote the Democratic\r\nticket in every subsequent election, the race division would remain\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nCan these differences be effaced, alienations be healed, and\r\novershadowing perils be averted? What concerns the patriot is to find\r\na solution for this gigantic and appalling problem. The statesman has\r\nnot yet arisen, disposed to grapple with the problem, or capable of\r\nsuggesting a feasible and efficacious remedy. With the least hardship\r\nto the negro, proper recognition of his rights as a man, due regard to\r\nthe just ends of our Government, and the purposes of its founders,\r\nsome scheme, if possible, wise, adequate, and comprehensive, should be\r\ndevised. Whatever hitherto has been suggested has been met with\r\nopposition and is justly liable to criticism. The most obvious remedy,\r\nand which has been tried with some success, is to uplift the race by\r\nmeans of public schools and proper religious instruction. All honor to\r\nthe schools that train the youth into self-respecting manhood and\r\nwomanhood! All honor for the efforts that are making to correct the\r\ndebasement of slavery, to unite faith and practice, to infuse\r\nreligious life with an ethical Christianity, and to form a moral basis\r\nfor life and character! The crimes of both races in the South, pushed\r\nwithin the last few years to most brutal atrocities, show that there\r\ncan be no safety for free institutions, no guarding against savage\r\ndegradation, if either race be kept in crass ignorance. Both must\r\nsuffer. It would be some relief from ballot-box evils and perils if\r\nthe examples of New England and of Louisiana, Mississippi, and South\r\nCarolina were followed by all the States. As \"universal suffrage has\r\nno anchorage except in the people's intelligence,\" Massachusetts\r\nrequires of voters a prepayment of taxes, and voting and\r\noffice-holding are limited to those who can read the Constitution in\r\nthe English language and write their names. What has been done by\r\nStates, denominations, and individuals through schools is not\r\ndiscouraging to larger and better efforts, but is a stimulus to and an\r\nassurance of excellent results. The plantation system of the South,\r\nwhen land was in the hands of a few territorial magnates, was of very\r\ndoubtful utility. A bold peasantry is a country's pride, and a small\r\nfarmer should take the place of the large landed proprietor. If the\r\nnegroes should acquire and hold more real estate, they would be of\r\nmore value as citizens, and would have increased interest in the\r\nstability of laws, enforcing of contracts, and the preservation of\r\nState honor. An enlargement of the number of those who have a solid\r\nstake in the well-being of the country would be adding to the ranks of\r\nnatural supporters of law and honor, and strengthening the true\r\nfoundations on which the stability of a republican government must\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe congestion of the negroes aggravates the difficulties and dangers\r\nof the problem. The area of the States holding slaves in 1860 was\r\n901,740 square miles, and of the Northern States, excluding Alaska,\r\n2,123,860 square miles. By the census of 1890, the total population of\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West\r\nVirginia, was 37.3 per cent of negroes and 62.7 per cent of whites;\r\nor, including Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, 30.7 per\r\ncent of negroes and 69.3 per cent of whites. The African citizens are\r\nlocalized within a narrow area. A French statesman said, \"Cross the\r\nPyrenees and Africa begins.\" Cross Mason and Dixon's line, or the Ohio\r\nand Potomac Rivers, and in a truer sense Africa begins, for south of\r\nthat line the negroes are massed. It has been nearly forty years since\r\nslavery existed, for no one born since 1860 was ever practically a\r\nslave, and yet freedom has not diffused the seven million and a half\r\nof Africans. Despite all the traditions of bondage, all the\r\nmisrepresentations of modern literature, all the exaggerated accounts\r\nof intimidation and cruelty, the South remains the home of the negro.\r\nWhen he is told that equality, friendship, political sympathy, and\r\ngood wages may be secured by passing an invisible geographical line,\r\nhe persistently refuses to be seduced across. Senator Windom, of\r\nMinnesota, advocated a plan for distributing by assisted emigration,\r\nbut nothing came of it. Senator Edmunds, in discussing the Chinese\r\nquestion, said: \"The people of Massachusetts would not be hungry for\r\nan eruption of a million of the inhabitants of Africa, ... because\r\nthey believe, either by instinct or education, that it is not good for\r\nthe two races to be brought into that kind of contact in that\r\nplace.... The fundamental idea of a prosperous republic must be a\r\nhomogeneity of its people.\"\r\n\r\nColonization as a remedy has had many strong advocates. As early as\r\n1800 the Assembly of Virginia, in secret session, instructed the\r\nGovernor to correspond with the President with the object of procuring\r\na colony to which the negroes could be sent. Jefferson began the\r\ncorrespondence. The Legislature resumed the question, and expressed\r\nits preference for \"Africa or any of the Spanish or Portuguese\r\nsettlements in South America\" as the place \"to which free negroes or\r\nmulattoes, and such negroes or mulattoes as may be emancipated,\" might\r\nbe sent or choose to remove. In 1805 the members of Congress were\r\ninstructed to endeavor to procure suitable territory in Louisiana. In\r\n1811, being asked his opinion as to a settlement on the coast of\r\nAfrica, Jefferson replied that \"nothing is more to be wished than that\r\nthe United States would themselves undertake to make such an\r\nestablishment on the coast of Africa.\" In 1813 the Legislature openly\r\nand almost unanimously adopted, for the third time, resolutions\r\nsimilar to those of 1800. The same year the Colonization Society was\r\nformed, out of which grew the Republic of Liberia. President Lincoln,\r\nin his first annual message, December, 1861, referring to the two\r\nclasses of liberated persons that might be thrown upon Congress for\r\ntheir disposal, recommended \"that in any event steps be taken for\r\ncolonizing both classes at some place or places in a climate congenial\r\nto them. It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored\r\npeople already in the United States could not be included in such\r\ncolonization.\" Congress responded by voting one hundred thousand\r\ndollars for the voluntary emigration of freedmen from the District of\r\nColumbia to Haiti or Liberia, and later, in July, 1862, gave five\r\nhundred thousand dollars for the colonization of negroes in some\r\ntropical country beyond the limits of the United States. Mr. Lincoln\r\ncontinued to favor the policy of removal to another country, and five\r\ndays after signing the above act he read to his Cabinet a proposed\r\norder for \"the colonization of negroes in some tropical country.\"\r\nBurdened with this great question, amid the exigencies of the mighty\r\nwar, he continued to push the matter, and had Secretary Seward send a\r\ncircular letter to England, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark, with\r\nregard to colonizing the negroes in some of their tropical\r\npossessions. Offers came from the Danish West Indies, Dutch Surinam,\r\nBritish Guiana, Honduras, Haiti, New Granada, and Ecuador. Mr. Lincoln\r\nconsidered the offers from New Granada and an island off Haiti, and\r\neven sent a colony to the latter. Again, in his annual message in\r\n1862, he argued for colonization, and asked for an appropriation,\r\nbut, under the passions of the terrible conflict then raging, the\r\nCongress, instead of heeding the request, repealed the former act\r\nappropriating five hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, against their will, were transported, by coercive\r\nmeasures, to allotted lands beyond the Mississippi, but that was\r\nbefore the modern discovery that the United States should grant\r\n\"fraternity and assistance to all people\" under other than republican\r\ngovernments, and that universal suffrage was the infallible expedient\r\nfor civilizing semibarbarous peoples. President Harrison, in his\r\nletter of acceptance, writing on another subject, says, \"We are\r\nalready under a duty to defend our civilization by excluding alien\r\nraces whose ultimate assimilation with our people is neither possible\r\nnor desirable.\"\r\n\r\nRemedies, strong and adequate and feasible, may not be found readily,\r\nbut there are gentler and quieter agencies which may be used by both\r\nraces to mutual advantage. The white people, in accepting the\r\nlegitimate consequences of defeat, in vigorous efforts to restore\r\nantebellum prosperity, in establishing schools, in reconstructing\r\nshattered society, have done nobly, but they are not without sin.\r\nLaws, general and wise and impartial, on the statute-book need for\r\ntheir enforcement a sustaining public opinion, but this has not always\r\nbeen forthcoming. Lawless and violent proceedings, always unnecessary\r\nand demoralizing, sometimes as brutal as the crimes which excited\r\nhorror; harsh and unjust contracts; interferences in elections; false\r\nregistration and counting of votes, and other acts which the plea of\r\nself-preservation did not justify, have evinced the harshness and\r\ninjustice of dominant power, and have not tended to soften prejudices\r\nor make the situation more tolerable. Each race is fortunately\r\nimproving in intercourse and in dealings with the other, and time and\r\nsober judgment are, in a sensible degree, removing causes of\r\nalienation which are not inherent and incurable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"What a blessing,\" said President Sir John Lubbock, at the late\r\n     meeting of the International Congress of Zoölogists, \"it would be\r\n     for mankind if we could stop the enormous expenditure on engines\r\n     for the destruction of life and property, and spend the tenth,\r\n     the hundredth, even the thousandth part on scientific progress!\r\n     Few people seem to realize how much science has done for man, and\r\n     still fewer how much more it would still do if permitted. More\r\n     students would doubtless have devoted themselves to science if it\r\n     were not so systematically neglected in our schools; if men and\r\n     boys were not given the impression that the field of discovery is\r\n     well-nigh exhausted. We, gentlemen, know how far that is from\r\n     being the case. Much of the land surface of the globe is still\r\n     unexplored; the ocean is almost unknown; our collections contain\r\n     thousands of species waiting to be described; the life-histories\r\n     of many of our commonest species remain to be investigated, or\r\n     have only recently been discovered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS AND AMERICAN CAPITAL.\r\n\r\nBY J. RUSSELL SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Philippine Islands are of value as a place for investment is\r\nan unexplained generalization that is now being used to tempt business\r\nmen. The object of this article is to discuss this generalization. The\r\nidea that the Philippine Islands are of importance to us, as a new\r\nfield for our industrial developments, depends upon two assumptions:\r\nFirst, that we need to go beyond the bounds of the United States;\r\nsecond, that the Philippines offer the best available field for the\r\nsatisfaction of that need.\r\n\r\nAs to the first assumption, the occasion and origin of the demand for\r\nthe retention of the Philippines furnish presumptive evidence that it\r\nrepresents no real economic want of the American people. No one ever\r\nthought of it until we heard the boom of Dewey's guns at Manila. The\r\ndemands that then arose for Eastern territory were the natural result\r\nof a just pride in the amazing triumph of our navy. Before the battle\r\nof Manila a suggestion that we should take the Philippines and RECEIVE\r\n$20,000,000 as a bonus we would have deemed preposterous. Before that\r\nbattle, one idea was uppermost in the minds of the American\r\npeople--namely, the development of the American continent. And yet,\r\nalong with the enthusiasm over the accomplishments of our army and\r\nnavy, the idea has crept into some minds that we are in need of more\r\nland to develop, and that we must find it in the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nExamination of the internal condition of the United States does not\r\nseem to indicate such need. Our exports are an index to our condition.\r\nIn 1872 we exported merchandise to the value of $522,000,000; in 1898\r\nthe amount had swelled to $1,230,000,000, an increase of two hundred\r\nand thirty-five per cent. No European nation has shown such progress.\r\nDespite their colonial empires, their armies and navies, their\r\nchartered companies, their spheres of influence, and all their\r\nelaborate paraphernalia, we are competing with them in their own\r\nmarkets. We have pursued a policy the opposite of theirs and are\r\noutstripping them in the race for a share of the world's trade. It is\r\nnot compatible with industrial wisdom to change and adopt the policy\r\nof our less successful rivals just as the success of our own policy is\r\nbeing fully demonstrated.\r\n\r\nA nation's commercial supremacy rests upon the same principles as a\r\nbusiness man's leadership in his trade--namely, superiority of\r\nproduction. It does not require a citation of evidence to say that the\r\nproducers of Europe are staggering under the burden of their armies\r\nand navies. While they are thus handicapped, we have nothing to fear\r\nunless we inflict upon ourselves a similar burden. We have succeeded\r\nby attending to our own industries, by developing our natural\r\nresources, by producing things that the people of other nations must\r\nhave. That development is but begun. Even England, the ruler of the\r\ngreatest colonial empire the world has ever known, the greatest\r\nmanufacturing nation, the mistress of the seas, stands with almost\r\nstationary exports. The United States, the nation with a small navy,\r\nthe nation that never really had a colony, the so-called isolated\r\nnation, has come by rapid strides to the point where she is the\r\nleading exporter of the world.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the progress of the United States should be\r\nchecked. England has demonstrated the fact that the nation that has\r\nthe iron and coal is the commercial mistress of the world. The United\r\nStates is continuing, and will continue the demonstration. England has\r\nbut 900 square miles of much-used coal lands, and she gets her iron\r\nore from Spain. We have over 200,000 square miles[D] of untouched coal\r\nlands; an almost continuous bed of iron ore, reaching from Lake\r\nOntario to Alabama.[E] Beside this great ore bed is the Appalachian\r\ncoal field, with coal mines in every State between New York and\r\nAlabama. There are mountains of iron ore in Missouri and Michigan. By\r\nthe special lines of lake steamers the iron ore of Lake Superior is\r\ntaken to Chicago and Cleveland, and thence carried by rail to\r\nPittsburg. There the eastern coal completes the conditions for the\r\nmost economical production of iron and steel. That gives the United\r\nStates the basis for our export trade in iron, steel, and machinery.\r\nWe are capturing the iron markets of the world, and, judging by our\r\nsupplies, can hold them for ages. As our iron and coal are the basis\r\nof all manufacturing industry, continued attention to them will give\r\nus the control of the world's trade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: The last United States census puts our coal lands at\r\nsomething more than 225,000 square miles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: \"This deposit occurs as far north as the southern shores\r\nof Lake Ontario, and thence extends in an almost continuous manner\r\nthrough Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee to central\r\nAlabama.\"--_N. S. Shaler's The United States of America, vol. i, p.\r\n432._]\r\n\r\nThere are many other lines of our internal development that are yet\r\nbarely begun. Irrigation is an example of this. The report of John W.\r\nNoble, Secretary of the Interior for 1891, said, \"One hundred and\r\ntwenty million acres that are now desert may be redeemed by irrigation\r\nso as to produce the cereals, fruits, and garden products possible in\r\nthe climate where the lands are located.\" That is an area nearly twice\r\nas large as the Philippine Islands, and it is open to the American\r\nsettler, while there is an indication that the Philippines may be\r\ninaccessible on account of their climate. Moreover, they are four\r\ntimes as densely populated as is the United States; and while we deem\r\nthe Chinese so undesirable that we exclude him from our shores, all\r\nauthorities agree that his race is superior to that of the Malays,\r\nTagals, and Negritos who inhabit the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe irrigable area is much larger than the States of New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Illinois, and Massachusetts combined. Those States at\r\nthe present time are supporting a population of over seventeen\r\nmillions, and many authorities claim that they will in the future\r\nsupport at least fifty millions. The regions of scanty rainfall that\r\ncan be irrigated are fairly crusted with potash and other soluble\r\nmineral ingredients that nourish plant life, and give to the valleys\r\nalready irrigated their astonishing fertility. This enables the\r\nfarmers to support themselves on such small areas that the life is\r\nalmost a communal one. The irrigated West can sustain a population as\r\ngreat as that sustained on an equal area in the East, or even\r\ngreater.[F] For years that dry climate has been a health restorer to\r\nthe sojourner there. This is not claimed for the Philippine Islands.\r\nThe building up of this Western empire with its canals and irrigating\r\nditches, its railroads and cities, will absorb a vast amount of\r\ncapital, and it is a natural and easy line of development for us. Mr.\r\nIrwin has said, \"To capital seeking investment in a large way,\r\nirrigation enterprises in the West offer a most solid, lucrative, and\r\ntempting field.\"[G] Secretary Noble has said, \"No one can now compute\r\nthe money value that will concentrate in these reservoirs and canals\r\nand ditches, carrying water to the fields of the husbandman, and upon\r\nwhich the people must depend for their prosperity.\"[H]\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: If we accept the reclaimable area given above as\r\napproximately correct, and apply a system of irrigation, it can be\r\ncultivated, \"and made the happy home of an industrious people more\r\nthan equaling in number the inhabitants of the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland.\"--_J. N. Irwin, in Forum, vol. i, p. 742._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Forum, vol. xii, p. 750.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Report of the Secretary of the Interior, 1891.]\r\n\r\nFive centuries ago large parts of eastern and western England were\r\nimpenetrable morasses. These have entirely disappeared before the\r\nskill of the engineer.\r\n\r\nN. S. Shaler says, \"The total area of the inundated lands of the\r\nUnited States probably exceeds 115,000 square miles, counting only\r\nthose flooded areas which are at present unsuited by their excessive\r\nhumidity for agricultural use, but which may be won to the service by\r\nengineering devices such as have been applied in the regions occupied\r\nby older civilizations.\"[I] This is more than 73,000,000 acres of\r\ndrainable swamps and marshes. Lands more easy of access have, in the\r\npast, so occupied our attention that these lowlands have thus far been\r\nalmost entirely neglected. They are located along our northern,\r\neastern, and southern borders in close proximity to water\r\ntransportation and to the large cities of the seaboard. They can be\r\ndrained, as were the swamps of England. Their fertility will make this\r\nprofitable, and they will support a large population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: The United States of America, vol. i, p. 382.]\r\n\r\nThe public highways of the United States are, on the whole, in\r\nanything but a desirable condition, and their improvement is a good\r\ninvestment for the commonwealth. We have railroads to build, harbors\r\nto deepen, and canals to dig. The United States is young yet, and\r\ntremendous tasks await her labor and capital.\r\n\r\nIn this country, so full of promise for the future, we are still using\r\nborrowed foreign capital. In The Forum for February, 1895, Mr. Alfred\r\nS. Lauterbach said, \"That the people of the United States require\r\nEuropean capital for the full development of the great resources of\r\nour country there can be no doubt.\" The same author made a \"very\r\nconservative estimate,\" and said that we owed to Europe annually:\r\n\r\n  \"For dividends and interest upon American securities\r\n    still held abroad, minimum                               $75,000,000\r\n\r\n  \"For profits of foreign corporations doing business here,\r\n    and of non-residents, derived from real estate,\r\n    investments, partnership profits, etc., about             75,000,000\r\n                                                            ------------\r\n                                                            $150,000,000\"\r\n\r\nThat is to say, we were paying a five-per-cent interest on\r\n$3,000,000,000 of foreign money.\r\n\r\nAs to the second assumption: It is claimed by some that we should have\r\nthe Philippines because they will furnish us the tropical products\r\nthat we are using in ever-increasing quantities. Two things are\r\nrevealed in the examination of our needs of tropic products and a\r\ncomparison of the Philippines with the American tropics: 1. That the\r\nPhilippines are at a great disadvantage in location. 2. That America\r\nis of sufficient area and natural wealth to meet all our needs, and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAs to location: It is a first principle of commerce to get supplies\r\nwhere they are most accessible. It is about ten thousand miles from\r\nNew York to Manila, twelve hundred to Havana, and eighteen hundred to\r\nthe continent of South America. Under these conditions the freight\r\nrates must always discriminate in favor of tropic America. The\r\ndisadvantage of the Philippines is increased by the fact that the\r\nships going from San Francisco or Panama to Manila are compelled to\r\ncarry their coal three thousand four hundred miles at one\r\nstretch--from Honolulu to Yokohama, the most available route. Then,\r\nagain, a large part of our tropic trade, and one that shows promise of\r\nthe most growth, is in the green fruits, such as cocoanuts,\r\npineapples, lemons, oranges, and bananas. Of the last article our\r\nimports have doubled every five years since 1865. On account of\r\ndistance it is not practicable to bring any of these fruits from the\r\nPhilippines, but there is no limit to the amount of trade that can\r\ngrow up on the lines that are now beginning to form between us and our\r\nsouthern neighbors.\r\n\r\nAs to the fitness of tropic America to supply our needs: There are\r\nCentral America, South America, and the West Indies. An examination of\r\ntheir area and productiveness shows that there is little to induce\r\nAmerican industry to control any part of the Eastern Hemisphere. Of\r\nthe 17,000,000 square miles that make up the Western Continent, the\r\ntropics make up 5,000,000 square miles--an area sufficient to make\r\nmore than one hundred States as large as Pennsylvania; an area nearly\r\nfifty times as great as the Philippines. The variety of its\r\nproductions is scarcely excelled even by the East Indies. There are\r\nonly two important tropic products imported into the United States\r\nthat are not already largely produced on this continent. They are\r\nManila hemp and tea, and it would appear that the reason they come\r\nfrom the East is because of present labor conditions there. Manila\r\nhemp is a sort of half-wild product that may yet have an introduction\r\nto our rich tropics just as the potato was introduced into Europe, and\r\nmany of our crops have been introduced from Europe. Even the tea plant\r\nthrives in the warm regions of America as far north as Tennessee.\r\nSmall quantities of tea are now grown in various parts of America,[J]\r\nbut the cheap labor of the East has made it unprofitable here. We are\r\nat the present time getting nine tenths of our tea from India, where\r\nAnglo-Saxon care has developed the industry and is fast driving China\r\nout of the tea market of the world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: United States Report on Commerce and Navigation for\r\n1897.]\r\n\r\nThere is a difference when it comes to the two great tropic staples of\r\ncoffee and sugar. Our imports of these two articles in 1897 were\r\nvalued at $180,000,000, while the imports of tea were less than one\r\ntwelfth as much. At the present time nearly all the coffee used in the\r\nUnited States comes from Central and South America, whence also comes\r\nthe greater part of the world's supply. The declining price of coffee\r\nindicates that we shall get it under more favorable terms in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWe import about $100,000,000 worth of sugar per annum.[K]\r\nApproximately two fifths of it is beet sugar and comes from the\r\ncontinent of Europe, and the rest is cane sugar from scattered sources\r\nin the tropics. Only one sixth comes from the Eastern Hemisphere. We\r\nare getting sugar from Europe, not because it is the natural\r\ndevelopment of the industry, but because those countries are willing\r\nto give an export bounty on all that is exported. This makes\r\nexportation possible. Meanwhile the American sugar industry is left to\r\nunprogressive and slovenly methods, but it needs only a reasonable\r\naddition of capital and labor to enable it to supply the markets of\r\nthe world. An Englishman of much experience in the sugar-growing\r\ncolonies of Great Britain says that by the introduction of improved\r\nmethods all the sugar that we use in this country could be grown on\r\none half of the little island of Porto Rico.[L] This would cause heavy\r\ncomplaint from the sugar-cane region of Louisiana, and from those\r\nsections of our country that are beginning to hope for a future in the\r\nbeet-sugar industry. Certainly America can supply herself in this\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: W. Allyne Ireland, in an address before the University of\r\nPennsylvania.]\r\n\r\nIndia rubber is another of our tropic imports that promises to\r\nincrease in importance with improvements in our ability to use it.\r\nNearly the whole supply comes from the American tropics. There it\r\nthrives everywhere. We are importing it from almost all of our sister\r\nrepublics, and although it responds readily to cultivation and yields\r\na profitable crop,[M] the main supply is yet taken from the wild trees\r\nof the forests. Like the other products it waits for the capital which\r\nit will well repay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: See Coffee and India-Rubber Culture in Mexico. By Matias\r\nRomero, late Mexican minister to the United States.]\r\n\r\nBy a comparison of the average yields per acre of the leading tropic\r\nimports with the amounts of those imports, we shall find the area of\r\nthe territories that are in cultivation to meet our present needs.[N]\r\nIn 1897 we imported into this country from all sources the crops that\r\nwould be yielded by 1,400 square miles of coffee, 30 of bananas, 40 of\r\ncocoa beans, 60 of India rubber, 10 of oranges; a total of 1,540\r\nsquare miles. Add to that the area that will be needed for our sugar,\r\nand the result does not equal the whole of Porto Rico. The area of\r\nPorto Rico is less than 4,000 square miles. Multiply these crop areas\r\nby ten, to make allowance for crop rotation and for the time taken for\r\nnew plantations to come into bearing. The result will be less than\r\n40,000 square miles, a territory not half as great as the area of the\r\nWest India islands. They in their turn do not comprise the fiftieth\r\npart of the area of tropic America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: The average yields of tropic produce were made out with\r\nthe assistance of the Cyclopædia Britannica, Coffee and India-Rubber\r\nCulture in Mexico (Romero), and statistics obtained at the\r\nPhiladelphia Commercial Museums. The amounts of the imports were taken\r\nfrom the United States Report on Commerce and Navigation for 1897.]\r\n\r\nWhen the time comes that American industry needs to develop more\r\nlands, there they lie. They are our opportunity. They have an almost\r\nvirgin soil, because we have been too busy with our own internal\r\ndevelopment to give them needed attention. They need capital, and we\r\nhave been borrowing money abroad to meet our needs at home. Their\r\ninhabitants are idle for lack of employment; they will respond to our\r\ncapital. The United States is the natural market for the West Indies;\r\nthey lie close to our shores, and when the Nicaragua Canal comes they\r\nwill be but islands in an American lake--parts of the industrial unit\r\nof Greater America. They can give us the things that are needed to\r\nround out our consumption, and we can do the same for them.\r\n\r\nIt is illogical and unlike American shrewdness to go seven thousand\r\nmiles for tropic lands when an equally valuable, a more valuable, area\r\nis within seven hundred miles of us. The comparison becomes even more\r\nstriking when it is remembered that the control of the Philippines\r\nbrings to us a burden of problems from which industrial development in\r\nthis country is free.\r\n\r\nThe Government at Washington may spend our millions and establish\r\ngovernment in the Philippines, but will American capital go there?\r\nWill our citizens invest their money seven thousand miles away while\r\ntropic America is so much nearer, and is, moreover, an equally rich\r\nand far more extended field? This does not assume the conquest of\r\nAmerican regions. It is not necessary to have governmental control in\r\norder to profit by the industries of a country. The conditions of\r\nmodern industry prove this most conclusively. But for this fact the\r\nprogress of the world would have been much less rapid. We have an\r\nexample of this in American railroads: they have been largely built by\r\nEnglish capital; the same is also true to a greater or less degree of\r\nmany of our other industries. What England has done in North America\r\nwithout governmental control, we can do in Central and South America\r\nwhen our industrial condition demands new areas to work over. By the\r\nmodernized Monroe doctrine our supremacy in this hemisphere is\r\nassured, and we have the guarantee of a clear field. Our interests are\r\nalso furthered by our friendly relations with the American peoples and\r\nby our nearness to them.\r\n\r\nThe American policy of our forefathers is the one for us, even from\r\nthe industrial point of view. America is an industrial unit, an\r\neconomic unit, full of undeveloped possibilities that await the hand\r\nof American enterprise. Our resources can abundantly provide for our\r\nmaterial needs. The continent is controlled by the most ingenious of\r\nall the races, and is dominated by the highest political ideals known\r\nto man. What need have we to reach out across seven thousand miles of\r\nocean to take lands populous with millions of barbarians?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\nBY F. L. OSWALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--REPTILES AND FISHES.\r\n\r\nThe present fauna of our planet includes many varieties of mammals and\r\nreptiles, and a few kinds of birds, that are found only on certain\r\nislands--a fact which seemed rather to justify the once universal\r\nbelief in the origin of species by separate acts of creation.\r\n\r\nA different theory of explanation has, however, been suggested by the\r\ndiscovery of fossil remains, proving the former existence of closely\r\nallied forms on continents where their battle for existence had to be\r\nfought against beasts of prey and competitors for a limited food\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe supposed products of an island genesis by the fiat of supernatural\r\nagencies, demanding recognition in mental penance and the payment of\r\ntithes, may thus be simply animal Crusoes, favored by the positive or\r\nnegative advantages of their surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe dodo, in its struggle for survival, would have had no chance\r\nagainst South American tiger-cats. Not one of the twenty-odd species\r\nof Madagascar lemurs could have held its own against the competition\r\nof the African daylight monkeys.\r\n\r\nYet there was a time when night apes and large ground birds seem to\r\nhave had things all their own way, the world over, and Central America\r\nmay have afforded a chance for existence to several species of\r\nreptiles which at present are found only on the West Indian islands.\r\n\r\nThe Cuban bush tortoise (_Emys nigra_) is found only in the forests of\r\nSantiago and Puerto Principe, and there only on the south coasts. It\r\nis the most sluggish creature of its genus, and does not seem to have\r\nhad enterprise enough to crawl around the sand belt of Cape Maysi and\r\ncolonize the jungles of the north side provinces. It is as helpless as\r\na hedgehog, _minus_ its bristles. The darkeys of the Cuban planters\r\ncrack its armor with home-made hammers, and the _tortuga prieta_, or\r\nprieta, as they call it for short, forms a factor of holiday _menus_\r\nas frequently as 'possum pie in southern Georgia.\r\n\r\nSwift-flowing rivers bear it away as they would a floating log, and it\r\nis wholly incredible that its ancestors should have crossed the\r\nCaribbean Sea in quest of a more congenial home; but it is possible\r\nenough that its eggs may have been ferried across on one of the\r\ndriftwood islands which the Sumasinta River often tears from the coast\r\nswamps of southern Mexico and carries into the current of the Gulf\r\nStream. The evolution of the South American giant cats was probably\r\nthe death warrant of its continental relatives, but in Cuba it had no\r\nfour-footed enemies except the _hutia_, or jungle rat, that now and\r\nthen destroys its eggs.\r\n\r\nAn equally favored islander is the grayish-yellow rock lizard,\r\nabounding in the uplands of Cuba and Hayti. The lizard-killing cranes\r\nof Honduras have not found their way to the Antilles, and the\r\n_lagartilla_ still basks in the sun that once smiled upon the\r\nindolence of the naked Lucayans.\r\n\r\nThe _toco_, or Cuban hornbill, however, devours small reptiles of all\r\nsorts, and the West Indian tree lizards have become almost as nimble\r\nas squirrels. They dodge behind branches and wait to ascertain the\r\norigin of every flitting shadow, but from imminent danger save\r\nthemselves by a swift descent, followed by a bold leap into the\r\nthickets of the underbrush. Their courtship is quite as grotesque as\r\nthat of the strutting bush pheasants. The males will swing their heads\r\nup and down and puff up their throat-bags till their skin seems on the\r\npoint of disruption, while the objects of their rivalry sit blinking,\r\nreluctant to risk an open manifestation of preference. Some gorgeously\r\nbeautiful varieties are found in Jamaica: greenish-blue, with a\r\nmetallic luster, and rows of bright crimson spots, as if the design of\r\nprotective colors had been patterned after the flower shrubs of the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IGUANA.]\r\n\r\nThe word _iguana_ is of Mexican origin, and rarely used in the Spanish\r\nWest Indies, but the animal itself is--for culinary purposes, though\r\nthe Haytian negroes do not go quite as far as the mongrels of Yucatan,\r\nwhere iguana farmers fatten the defenseless reptiles with cornmeal, in\r\nwickerwork baskets, that are brought to market as a New England\r\npoultry fancier would fetch in a crateful of spring chickens. But,\r\nprejudice aside, there is no harm in an iguana fricassee; the meat is\r\nwhite and insipid, but takes the flavor of every spice, and is far\r\nmore digestible than such hyperborean delicacies as fried eels and\r\npork fritters. There are two species--one in eastern Cuba, with spines\r\nall the way down to its tail-tip, and in Hayti a smaller one, with a\r\nsmoother tail, but with an exaggerated throat-bag and wattles like a\r\nturkey gobbler.\r\n\r\n_Lagartos vastecos_, or \"tree alligators,\" the Cuban creoles call the\r\nscampering forest dwellers, that attain a length of four feet, and can\r\nstampede foreigners by leaping to terra firma with an _aplomb_ that\r\nscatters the dry leaves in all directions. If chased, they will take\r\nto water like frogs. They are first-class swimmers, their throat-bag\r\nserving the purpose of a float, and once in the ripple of the stream\r\nare hard to keep in sight, as they have a trick of keeping their legs\r\nclose to the body and navigating by means of their submerged tails.\r\nLike the rainbow hues of the coryphene (miscalled dolphin), the bright\r\ncolors of the iguana soon fade after death, and the shriveled\r\ngreenish-brown specimens of our taxidermists give no idea of the\r\nappearance of the living animal in the sunlight of its native land.\r\nThe _Iguana tuberculata_ (eastern Cuba) is velvet-green above, with\r\nsaffron flanks, ringed with blue, black, and brown stripes, and the\r\npet specimens, basking on the porch of a coffee planter, can challenge\r\ncomparison with the paroquets that flutter about the eaves of the\r\noutbuildings like swifts around a martin box.\r\n\r\nCuba has also acclimatized a horned frog, and one species of those\r\ncurious half-lizards whose shapes may have suggested the dragon fables\r\nof antiquity. The \"basilisk\" (_Cyclura carinata_) is only half a yard\r\nlong, but can erect its crest and raise its pronged tail in a manner\r\nthat will make a dog leap back in affright. It has no goiter-bag, but\r\nthe skin of its throat is elastic, and can be made to swell out like\r\nthat of the East Indian cobra, while its multiplex spines vibrate\r\nominously. The little monster is, nevertheless, one of the most\r\nharmless reptiles of the tropics, and subsists on succulent leaves,\r\nwith occasional _entremets_ of small grubs and insects. In that case,\r\nhowever, Nature has rather overdone its efforts at protective\r\nugliness, and the creoles kill the poor simulator of terrors as the\r\nMexican rustics would a horned toad.\r\n\r\nA plurality of the zoölogical immigrants of the West Indies seem to\r\nhave come from Mexico, and it is a suggestive fact that the number of\r\nreptiles steadily decreases from west to east. Cuba, with its western\r\nheadland approaching the east coast of Yucatan, thus came in for a\r\nlion's share of lizards, tortoises, and ophidians.\r\n\r\nHayti, though only one fourth smaller, experienced a\r\nseventy-five-per-cent discount, and all natives and travelers agree on\r\nthe _curiosum_ that there is _not a single species of serpent_ on the\r\nisland of Porto Rico. Trinidad, with an area of only fifteen hundred\r\nsquare miles, but laved by the giant current of the Orinoco, boasts\r\ntwenty-eight species of land serpents, besides several pythons and\r\nswamp vipers. The Trinidad museum of venomous ophidians does not,\r\nhowever, include the dreaded fer-de-lance, which infests the woods\r\nnear Samana Bay on the south coast of San Domingo. The _Bothrops\r\nlanceolatus_ is larger than a rattlesnake, and its bite, though not\r\nalways fatal, causes fearful inflammation, but its aggressive\r\ndisposition has been greatly exaggerated. Like most venomous serpents,\r\nit is a sluggish brute, relying on its ability to crouch motionless\r\ntill its prey comes in range, then get in a snap bite and shrink back\r\nto wait till the virus begins to take effect, and the victim, in its\r\nfever spasms, betrays its helplessness by those eccentricities of\r\nconduct which are apt to be misinterpreted by the dupes of the\r\n\"serpent-charm\" superstition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FER-DE-LANCE.]\r\n\r\nThe fer-de-lance is found also on the islands of Martinique and Santa\r\nLucia, where the natives counteract its virus with a decoction of\r\njungle hemlock, and the basis of its grewsome reputation seems to be\r\nthe fact that it does not warn the intruders of its haunts, after the\r\nmanner of the cobra or the rattlesnake, but flattens its coils and,\r\nwith slightly vibrating tail, awaits events. If the unsuspecting\r\ntraveler should show no sign of hostile intent he may be allowed to\r\npass unharmed within two yards of the coiled matador, but a closer\r\napproach is apt to be construed as a challenge, and the _vivoron_,\r\nsuddenly rearing its ugly head, may scare the trespasser into some\r\nmotion of self-defense--he may lift his foot or brandish his stick in\r\na menacing manner. If he does he is lost. The lower coils will\r\nexpand, bringing the business end, neck and all, a few feet nearer;\r\nthe head \"points,\" like a leveled rifle, then darts forward with\r\nelectric swiftness, guided by an unerring instinct for the selection\r\nof the least-protected parts of the body.\r\n\r\nAnd the vindictive brute is ready to repeat its bite. For a moment it\r\nrears back, trembling with excitement, and, if felled by a blow of its\r\nvictim's stick, will snap away savagely at stumps and stones, or even,\r\nlike a wounded panther, at its own body.\r\n\r\nA very curious adaptation of means to ends in the modification of the\r\nvirus is its swiftly fatal effect on birds. A stricken child, though\r\nhalf crazed with fear, may run a distance of three miles before\r\nparalysis begins to impede its motions; a squirrel will escape to its\r\nnest in the top of the tree, only to come forth again and topple down\r\nin its delirium; but a bird drops as if he had swallowed a dose of\r\nprussic acid. Serpent virus is specifically a bird poison; in other\r\nwords, it acts instantaneously in cases where a few moments' delay\r\nwould defeat the purpose of the snap bite. Wounded rodents will not\r\nrun very far and can be relied upon to come out of their holes; but a\r\nbitten bird, unless promptly paralyzed, would fly out of sight and\r\ndrop in distant thickets, beyond the ken of its destroyer. And of all\r\nbird-killing reptiles the fer-de-lance is the most destructive. The\r\nSpaniards have varied its bill of fare by importing the wherewithal of\r\nan occasional rabbit stew, but during the preceding ages it had to\r\nsubsist on poultry, like a popular circuit preacher--the _hutia_ rat\r\nhaving developed a talent for avoiding its haunts.\r\n\r\nThe alleged _horror naturalis_ of serpents is perhaps not more\r\ndeep-rooted than the aversion to cats; at all events, the West Indians\r\nhave overcome it sufficiently to prefer rat-killing snakes to\r\ntabbies. In thousands of rancho cabins a pet serpent of the genus\r\n_coluber_ may be seen gliding noiselessly along the rafters, or slip\r\nthrough the crack of a floor plank to reach the penetralia of the\r\nbasement, where the death shriek of rodents soon after announces the\r\nresult of its activity. Aristocratic Creoles relegate it to their\r\nstables, but the tenants of numerous backwood _casuchas_ furnish it a\r\ncotton-stuffed bed box, and reward its services with a weekly dish of\r\nmilk. There are several species of large river serpents, and one true\r\nboa, the Cuban _matapollos_, or chicken-killer, that attains a length\r\nof eighteen feet, and has been known to use its supernumerary coils\r\nfor the purpose of cracking the ribs of a hound flying to the\r\nassistance of the barnyard rooster.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned jungle tortoise there are several\r\nland turtles of the genus _chlemmys_, and thousands of chelidonians\r\nare annually caught on Samana Bay, southern Porto Rico, St. Vincent,\r\nthe Isle of Pines, and the north coast of Matanzas, Cuba. Those of\r\nSantiago Bay have gradually been exterminated, but a large number of\r\nWest Indian fishing waters are practically inexhaustible. A specialist\r\nlike Agassiz might haul nondescripts from scores of Haytian coast\r\nrivers, and the angle fishers of the Cuban sierra brooks can hook an\r\nequally interesting reproduction of an Appalachian species.\r\n\r\n\"Some of our companions had to eke out a haul with crawfish,\" says the\r\ntraveler Esterman, \"but our own string of sundries included a puzzle\r\nfor naturalists. We had caught some twenty brook trout, absolutely\r\nindistinguishable from the species found in the head waters of the\r\nTennessee River. Where did they come from? Had they crossed the Gulf\r\nof Mexico and ascended the rapids of half a hundred rivers, or had\r\nNature copied her own handiwork in such details as the small dark\r\ndots below each red spot, and the occasional breaks in the lines of\r\nthe silver-white keel streaks?\"\r\n\r\nThe perch of the forest rivers include several nest-building\r\nvarieties, and the sportsmen of Kingston, Jamaica, often amuse\r\nthemselves with target practice at a species of rock fish that come\r\nclear out of the water and bask, like coots, on the harbor cliffs.\r\n\r\nWith every mile farther south the number and variety of the finned\r\naborigines become more infinite, and the fishermen of the estuary of\r\nSan Juan de Porto Rico alone catch pompanos, mullets, cavalli, red\r\nsnappers, chiquillos (a kind of sardelles), sea bass, dorados,\r\nskip-jack, angelfish, skate, ray, sheepshead, garfish, torpedo-fish,\r\ndevilfish or giant ray, cobia, hogfish, croakers, shark, and\r\ncoryphenes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING FISH (_Exocoetus volitans_); FLYING GURNARD OR\r\nFLYING ROBIN (_Cephalacanthus volitans_). (From Baskett's Story of the\r\nFishes.)]\r\n\r\nThe tiger of the sea, the great white shark, occasionally visits the\r\nharbor waters of Cuba, and has been known to seize barefooted peons,\r\nsurf-bathing horses in the next neighborhood of Morro Castle, and drag\r\nthem under so suddenly that their companions were unable to account\r\nfor their disappearance till the foam of the breakers became flecked\r\nwith blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTERFLY FISH.]\r\n\r\nThat champion of marine man-eaters is as smooth as a hypocrite, and\r\nhides its double row of horrible fangs under a slippery nose, while\r\nthe little butterfly fish tries its best to disguise its helplessness\r\nwith a crest of spiny fins. Its length rarely exceeds four inches, and\r\nit can be handled with impunity, but its spines are just rigid enough\r\nto entangle it in tufts of gulf weed, and in company of equally tiny\r\nsea horses and goldfish, it can often be seen in the aquariums of the\r\nJamaica seaport towns.\r\n\r\n[_To be continued._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STUDY OF LUIGI LUCCHENI (ASSASSIN OF THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA).\r\n\r\nBY CESARE LOMBROSO.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--LUIGI LUCCHENI.]\r\n\r\nThere is not an enlightened person in the world who does not deplore\r\nthe anarchist crime committed last summer by Luccheni in Geneva upon\r\nthe unfortunate Empress of Austria. With grief is associated the duty\r\nof inquiring what could have been the origin of a misdeed which\r\nbesides being cruel had the vice of being absurd, falling as it did\r\nupon a poor woman near the tomb, who was ready to welcome death, and\r\nwho had no political influence, by an assassin who had not suffered\r\nany offense from her or from her government, and who further had the\r\nimpudence to boast of his crime as if it had been a heroic act.\r\n\r\nWe begin our inquiry by seeking for an explanation of the act by means\r\nof a study of the person of the murderer in conformity with the rules\r\nof the anthropological school.\r\n\r\nLuigi Luccheni is the illegitimate son of a Parmesan servant now\r\nliving in America, and her master, who lived in the Parmesan\r\nterritory, a priest, unbalanced and intemperate, who sent her when she\r\nwas pregnant to Paris to be confined. There she abandoned her newborn\r\nbabe to a foundling asylum. The child was sent thence to his native\r\ncountry and placed, till he was nine years old, with a Parmesan family\r\nnamed Monici, of whom the father was a shoemaker, very poor and\r\nintemperate, and the mother immoral.\r\n\r\nAfter he was nine years old he was put with a family named Nicasi,\r\ngood people, but very poor--peasants, or rather mendicants, so that he\r\ntoo became a mendicant, wandering with his comrades through the\r\nstreets and pilfering till he was thirteen years old. It appears from\r\nwhat Dr. Guerini, of Parma, writes me that during this time he had\r\nepileptic fits. When twelve years old he went to school, where he\r\nappeared bright but impulsive, and on one occasion in his anger\r\ndestroyed the portrait of the king.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of fourteen to that of nineteen he was a servant, and had\r\ntwo masters, and wandered in Liguria, Switzerland, and Austria, where\r\nhe was arrested, sent back to his country, and prohibited from showing\r\nhimself in the east. He then entered the military service, where he\r\nconducted himself very well, incurring only light punishments for\r\nassaulting a comrade and for helping a sergeant get out of the\r\nbarracks at night. He was so liked by his superiors and comrades that\r\nwhen, three years afterward, in 1897, he left the army, Captain the\r\nPrince de Vera engaged him as his servant. In this service he\r\nexhibited great affection for children, and, what is strange, he was\r\nso good a monarchist that he was scandalized that at the commemoration\r\nof the deceased Cavolotti, in Naples, the orator was permitted to\r\npraise him as a political man without interruption from the delegate.\r\n\r\nOne day, irritated because he had been denied some permission, he\r\nabruptly took his leave, declaring that he was not born to be a\r\nservant, and returned to Switzerland to work as a marble polisher. But\r\neven from Switzerland he kept continually imploring his old employer\r\nto take him back, declaring in a letter which revealed symptoms of a\r\npersistent delirium that \"he probably would not receive him again\r\nbecause he did not go to mass\"; which indicates substantially that he\r\nhad not that repugnance for the anti-anarchical life of a servant\r\nwhich he manifested previously and afterward.[O]\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: It appears that he afterward made the strange request for\r\nan anarchist to be appointed guard of the prison, and was irritated\r\nwhen it was denied. (See A. Gautier, Le procès Luccheni. Vienna,\r\n1899.)]\r\n\r\nWhether all at once or not he became an extreme anarchist. He signed\r\nand composed anarchist hymns. Suspected by his comrades of not being\r\nzealous enough, and also perhaps of being a spy, he decided to strike\r\na blow against some prince; he chose the empress as his victim\r\npossibly because he had suffered his first annoyance in Austria. He,\r\nwho had never killed a fly, had a rude instrument prepared--a file;\r\npracticed for a considerable time, perhaps a month, at striking with\r\nit, and having committed the crime, tried to escape. When stopped by\r\ntwo citizens he did not resist, and behaved in a very different way\r\nfrom common criminals, therein exhibiting a tinge of insanity. He, for\r\nexample, although he knew French very well, denied it and demanded an\r\ninterpreter in the interrogations. He sang and laughed continually,\r\nand was glad that he had dealt his victim a good blow, and that he had\r\nstruck deep with the instrument, boasting that he had used a file\r\ninstead of a dagger. He was, besides, solicitous of publicity,\r\ndeclaring to the reporters and the judges that he had done the deed\r\nall alone, that he had left his captain to accomplish his idea, that\r\nhe had been an anarchist for thirteen years, etc. In two ungrammatical\r\nand very long letters to the journal _Don Marzio_, in Naples, chosen\r\nevidently because he had seen it at his master's, he declared that he\r\nwas not a criminal born, as Lombroso would have it, nor a madman, and\r\nthat he had not been incited by misery but by conviction, because, if\r\nall would do as he had done, middle-class society would soon\r\ndisappear. He knew that this single assassination would be of no\r\navail, but he had, nevertheless, committed it for an example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--EXTRACT FROM A LETTER BY LUCCHENI.]\r\n\r\nHe wrote to the President of the Swiss Confederation that he would\r\nrather be tried at Lucerne, because the death penalty was in force\r\nthere, and repeated the statement to the judges; he wrote to his\r\nmaster that he was more worthy of him than ever; he replied to the\r\nreporters and the judges who reproached him with having killed a\r\nhelpless woman, that as for that, if she had been a child, but a\r\nprince, he would have killed her all the same. At another time he\r\nsaid, in a wild way: \"I killed her because she did not work; whoever\r\ndoes not work should not eat, and I was not going to work for her\"--a\r\nreason which would be as good for the slaughter of several million\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nCurious and important is the remark of Luccheni that \"Crispi would not\r\nhave killed her because he was a thief\"; an evident proof of the\r\ncomplete lack of moral sense in anarchists,[P] who like primitive men\r\nconfound the crime with the deed, and regard criminality as a sort of\r\nmerit, a seal of fraternity; which demonstrates that the anarchistic\r\npractice, if not its theory, is an equivalence of crimes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: See my Delitto politico, Part III, and Gli Anarcici,\r\nsecond edition.]\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he had never committed blood-crimes, he replied that he\r\nhad never had anything to do with courts, not even as a witness--which\r\nwas found to be true--but \"I entertained the idea this time, and acted\r\nupon it.\"\r\n\r\nLuccheni is a man of medium stature, about 1.63 metre, with very\r\nthick, light chestnut hair, stout, with dark-gray, half-closed eyes,\r\nroundish ears, heavy eyebrows, voluminous cheek bones and jaw\r\nprognatic, low forehead, very brachycephalic (cephalic index 88). He\r\nhas, therefore, a number of characteristics of degeneration common to\r\nepileptics and insane criminals. On the other hand, his handwriting,\r\nwith its minute characters, especially in the writing of past years,\r\nindicates a mild feminine disposition, with little energy of\r\ncharacter. This is especially seen in an autograph of 1896, which was\r\nprocured for me by Dr. Guerini, who got it from his patient (see Fig.\r\n2). This characteristic, which was extremely conspicuous in Caserio\r\nwhen he was near his crime, was also apparent in the assailant of\r\nGeneral Rocha. I have likewise observed it to be very conspicuous in\r\nepileptics and hysterical persons; and it corresponds, according as\r\nthey are in their psychical spasm or out of it, with a real double\r\npersonality provoked by their disease. In one, as I have shown in\r\n_L'Uomo Delinquente_, they write signatures that cover a whole page in\r\ntheir larger diameter, while the signature in the normal state is\r\noften smaller than the average (see Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--MACROGRAPHIC AND MICROGRAPHIC WRITING BY THE\r\nSAME EPILEPTIC.]\r\n\r\nThe same double personality that is apparent in the writing is\r\nattested in the psychology. We have seen that Luccheni was kind to\r\nchildren, that he was a good servant, characteristics quite opposed to\r\nthe anarchistic nature, and a genial companion; a man who in Africa\r\nwas enthusiastically fond of military life; who, a little while\r\nbefore, when he was in the service of the captain, had expressed\r\nextreme monarchical sentiments; and finally, when he had become an\r\nanarchist, again asked his master to be restored to his service. This\r\ndouble personality is another of the essential characteristics of\r\nhysteria and epilepsy.\r\n\r\nI have recently studied an epileptoid degenerate who has a sound mind,\r\nand, at least in his normal state, is quiet and gentle. But as soon as\r\nhe has taken hardly more than ninety grammes of alcohol (96° proof) he\r\nbecomes a wild anarchist, with fierce impulses and hallucinations, of\r\nwhich he has no recollection two hours afterward, or even charges them\r\nto his comrades. In this case a double personality is revealed, the\r\ndemonstration of which is completed by alterations of the visual field\r\nand of the touch.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, in Luccheni a degenerate and probably epileptic person\r\ndescended from an alcoholic father. Although he affirms that he is not\r\ninsane or a criminal born, he is a little of both, for he is epileptic\r\nand hysterical, so that his denial is already a beginning of a proof\r\nof disease. Luccheni also confirms what I have tried to demonstrate in\r\nmy _Delitto politico_--that the most frequent organic cause of similar\r\nmorbid impulses of a political character is hystero-epilepsy; for not\r\nonly do the declarations of some of his countrymen point to epilepsy,\r\nand the characteristics of degeneration in the skull confirm it, but\r\nhis inheritance from an alcoholic father and that impulsiveness and\r\nthat double personality, which make him pass from the gentlest of men\r\nto the cruelest, and which is reflected in the macrography alternating\r\nwith the micrography of the intervals between the spasms, are\r\naccumulative evidence of it.\r\n\r\nI have demonstrated the hysterical and epileptic basis in the\r\nanarchists and regicides Felicot, Monges, and Caserio, and\r\nparticularly in a vagabond anarchist, full of cranial anomalies, who\r\ntold me, when I questioned him concerning political reforms, \"Do not\r\nspeak to me of them, for as soon as I begin to think about them I am\r\ntaken with a vertigo and fall down\"; so that it seems to me possible\r\nto establish a psycho-epileptic equivalent in extreme political\r\ninnovators, an equivalent which is further manifest in their vanity,\r\nrising sometimes to megalomania, in their intermittent geniality, and\r\nespecially in their great impulsiveness. There was also latent in\r\nLuccheni an indirect disposition to suicide, which I have found in\r\nother political criminals, like Oliva, Nobiling, and Passananti,[Q]\r\nwho, having conceived a dislike for the king, made an attempt on his\r\nlife; and especially in Henry, who rejected the defense of his\r\nadvocate and his mother based on the insanity of his father, remarking\r\nthat it was the advocate's business to defend, his to die; and in that\r\nRoumanian who was photographed in a portrait that I have reproduced,\r\nin the act of committing suicide.[R] Luccheni, too, believed he would\r\nbe condemned to death, and was much disappointed when he learned that\r\nthere was no such penalty in the canton where he committed the crime.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: See my Delitto politico, 1890.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nIt may have been morbid vanity that prompted the exclamation he was\r\nheard to make, \"I wanted to kill some great person, so as to get my\r\nname in the papers\" (Gautier).\r\n\r\nBut while an organic, individual cause was good for a third in\r\nLuccheni's crime, he was much more influenced by the atmosphere in\r\nwhich he lived. An illegitimate child, left in one of those nurseries\r\nwhich are real nests of crime and graver disorders, then consigned to\r\na very poor and not always moral family of mendicant habits, having\r\nlearned nothing except to beg and wander, he found such modes of\r\nsubsistence as he could (notice the uncertainty and plurality of his\r\noccupations, indicating lack of assiduity--servant, soldier, marble\r\npolisher, and in the beginning peasant); he found, we might say, as\r\nthe most constant condition the infelicity which radiated around him\r\nfrom every quarter, and, reflecting the worst, urged him to this way\r\nof suicide. We should recollect, too, what Frattini said: \"Was it\r\nhunger brought me to this?\" and the anarchist whom Hamon speaks of:\r\n\"When I began to question the unfortunates of the hospital, it had a\r\nfrightful effect on me; I comprehended the need of solidarity and\r\nbecame an anarchist\"; and as another one said to the same Hamon: \"I\r\nbecame an anarchist when I saw my comrades begging for work with their\r\nfaces bathed in tears, and was indignant over it.\" Caserio wept when\r\nhe thought of the lot of his Lombard companions in misery. These\r\ncriminals by passion, by altruism, are, as Burdeau wrote, veritable\r\nphilanthropic assassins. They kill recklessly for the love of men.\r\n\r\nEpilepsy and hysteria in Luccheni are explained by his abrupt passage\r\nfrom one condition to the other, and by the conversion of factional\r\npassion in him into a criminal act. But there are epileptics and\r\ncriminals everywhere; yet persons thus disordered in Norway and Sweden\r\nare not transformed into anarchists; nor in Switzerland and England,\r\nwhither people resort from all parts of the world, and where, when\r\nanarchy shows itself, it is like a meteor falling to the earth from\r\nthe extra-planetary regions--wholly isolated and opposed to the world\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nThe most important cause of this transformation is the misery that\r\nweighs upon our unfortunate country, evidence of which comes in from\r\nevery side even upon those who are not miserable themselves. If even\r\nin the latest days Luccheni had been living comfortably, he could not,\r\nwith the excessively morbid altruism that dominated him, have failed\r\nto feel this misery, which is so profound and general in Italy.\r\n\r\nNot much erudition is required to demonstrate the immense economical\r\nembarrassment of Italy as contrasted with other countries when it is\r\nknown that we pay about five hundred times its value for salt, that\r\nbread is growing dearer every day, and that the amount consumed\r\ndiminishes one tenth every year in these lands.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, with justice that Scarfoglio said in explaining the\r\norigin of anarchism, \"A good fifth of the population of Italy are\r\nstill living in a savage state, dwelling in cabins that the Papuans\r\nwould not live in, accommodating themselves to a food which the\r\nShillooks would refuse, having a vision and an idea of the world not\r\nmuch more ample than that of the Kaffirs, and running over the land\r\ndesiring and seeking servitude.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that it is because of this condition--that is, of the\r\ndefective civilization that results from it--that there is everywhere\r\na weakened revulsion and diminished horror at blood-crimes, so that\r\nthere are now sixty homicides for every one hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe may learn from this what the true remedies should be. The idea of\r\nconquering anarchy by killing anarchists is not valid, because every\r\nepileptic has another ready to take his place, because anarchistic\r\ncrimes are to a great extent simply indirect suicides, and because\r\nanarchists think as little of their own lives as of the life of\r\nanother. It is rather necessary to change the direction of the disease\r\nby changing the miserable conditions in which it originates.\r\n\r\nNot for humanity, therefore, not for exalted social theories, but in\r\nour direct interest, we ought to make a complete change. The\r\nsuppression of a dozen anarchists is like killing a thousand microbes\r\nwithout disinfecting the surroundings that contain milliards of them;\r\nit is that we should look, if we want to be better, to breaking up the\r\nlarge estates, and ameliorating the conditions of agriculture and\r\noperative industry, and this in the interest of the governing classes.\r\n\r\nTyphus, cholera, and plague, it is true, attack chiefly the poor, but\r\nfrom these the contagion extends also to the rich; and from the\r\nunhealthy habitations in which the rich man permits beggars to crowd\r\nand suffer, the miasm, as if in revenge, is propagated to marble\r\npalaces.\r\n\r\nThat imbecile idea of some European nations, who, instead of\r\ndisinfecting the medium, find it better to put down the doctors who\r\npropose remedies, can not make itself at home except among peoples who\r\nare destined to perish.[S]--_Translated for the Popular Science\r\nMonthly from the Archives di Psichiatria._\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: To the charges made against me by M. Gautier (Le procès\r\nLuccheni, 1899) of having formulated a diagnosis without seeing the\r\npatient, which was therefore inexact, and of having described\r\ncharacteristics of degeneration which did not exist, I answer with the\r\npages of Forel, certainly the most eminent alienist of our time, who\r\nhad him under his eyes during the whole process, and whose diagnosis\r\ndiffers but little from mine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENDENCIES IN FRENCH LITERATURE.[T]\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED BY PROFESSOR DOWDEN'S RECENT BOOK.\r\n\r\nBY PELHAM EDGAR, PH. D.\r\n\r\n[Footnote T: A History of French Literature. By Edward Dowden, D.\r\nLit., LL. D., etc. New York: D. Appleton and Company. 1897.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To present Victor Hugo in a few pages is to carve a colossus on a\r\ncherry stone.\" Thus Professor Dowden prefaces his ten admirable pages\r\non the great French poet; and with equal appropriateness we might\r\nassign the phrase as a motto for the whole undertaking. The subject is\r\ntoo vast to cope with adequately in the limits of a slender volume,\r\nthe tendencies too complex; and the appeal from human interest, which\r\nsince the days of Sainte-Beuve and Taine has formed such an important\r\nelement in scientific criticism, had to be abandoned in favor of\r\ngeneralized views of literary conditions and tendencies necessarily\r\nabstract or impersonal in character. Yet, despite these evident\r\nrestrictions which the requirements of his task imposed upon him,\r\nProfessor Dowden has produced a work of extraordinary merit, a\r\nmasterpiece indeed in its kind. If we were not assured that everything\r\nwhich the eminent critic writes is its own sufficient justification,\r\nwe might be inclined to question the necessity of the present volume,\r\nin view of the painstaking and conscientious treatise that Mr.\r\nSaintsbury gave to the public some sixteen years ago, and which has\r\ndeservedly remained until the present time the most reliable English\r\ntext-book upon the subject of French literature. With no desire to\r\ndisparage Mr. Saintsbury's scholarly contribution, the present work\r\ndoes in truth supply a need which the earlier book, in spite of its\r\nabundant merit, failed to satisfy. It is not harsh criticism to state\r\nthat Mr. Saintsbury's volume, crammed as it is with a plethora of\r\ndates and titles, is at best a compendium for convenient reference,\r\nand consequently quite unreadable as a book. Professor Dowden, on the\r\nother hand, has conquered the dry-as-dust problem with admirable\r\nskill, and the charm of his diction and the easy sequence of his ideas\r\nlead the reader insensibly on to the close of a delightful volume. Nor\r\nis the book lacking in instructive value of a highly reliable kind,\r\nfor, in addition to an intimate knowledge of French criticism,\r\nProfessor Dowden is evidently familiar at first hand with all the more\r\nimportant works of which he treats, and not infrequently proffers\r\nfertile suggestions upon debated questions.\r\n\r\nHaving avowed, therefore, a genuine admiration of Professor Dowden's\r\nbook, will it be thought a graceless task if, with the proverbial\r\nperversity of critics, I endeavor to point out here and there\r\nquestions of importance that may seem to have merited more attention\r\nthan the author was perhaps able to afford to them within his\r\nrestricted space?\r\n\r\nThe mediæval portion of Professor Dowden's book is valuable not for\r\nits originality, but rather as the reflection of advanced modern\r\ncriticism in France. Therefore, in this brief review the mediæval\r\nperiod may be neglected, and turning to the second book, which deals\r\nwith the sixteenth century, the first writer of capital importance\r\nwhom we encounter is Clément Marot. The author has justly indicated\r\nthe decrepit conditions of poetry in Marot's youth in the degenerate\r\nhands of the Rhétoriqueurs, and also the powerful attraction which the\r\nallegorizing mania exercised on the poet's early work. His later\r\nmanner is justly emphasized, and his prowess in the lighter familiar\r\nforms of verse; but it is only by inference that we apprehend the\r\ncomparative neglect of his work until the later classical reaction\r\nrestored him to favor. Professor Dowden, indeed, throughout his book\r\nhas hardly conveyed a proper idea of the reactionary shocks by which\r\nFrench literature has invariably advanced. Thus the Pléiade, in the\r\nenthusiasm of their rupture with middle-age traditions, were blind to\r\nthe Renaissance elements in Marot's work, and seeking as they did to\r\nelevate poetry to nobler themes and a nobler manner, his easy familiar\r\ngrace was distasteful to them.\r\n\r\nRabelais, of course, is another \"colossus on a cherry stone,\" and the\r\npurport of his message is epitomized in a few luminous sentences. The\r\nelements of contrast in the man, and his full-blooded joy in living,\r\nwhich was the sign-manual of the Renaissance upon him, are indicated\r\nas follows: \"Below his laughter lay wisdom; below his orgy of\r\ngrossness lay a noble ideality; below the extravagances of his\r\nimagination lay the equilibrium of a spirit sane and strong. The life\r\nthat was in him was so abounding and exultant that it broke all dikes\r\nand dams; and laughter for him needed no justification, it was a part\r\nof this abounding life. After the mediæval asceticism and the\r\nintellectual bondage of scholasticism, life in Rabelais has its vast\r\noutbreak and explosion; he would be no fragment of humanity, but a\r\ncomplete man.\"\r\n\r\nProceeding to the Pléiade, we find its doctrine admirably enunciated,\r\nand one point of literary history is well brought out--namely, that to\r\nthe Pléiade, and not to Malherbe alone, belongs the honor of\r\nestablishing the bases of classicism in France, the difference chiefly\r\nresiding in the fact that the programme of the Pléiade was one of\r\nexpansion in matters of language and prosody, whereas it is precisely\r\nin these points that Malherbe and Boileau are concerned with\r\nrestrictive refinements. Again Professor Dowden, following perhaps in\r\nthe wake of M. Brunetière, characterizes the conditions of the time as\r\nbeing unfavorable to lyrical expansiveness. \"Ronsard's genius was\r\nlyrical and elegiac, but the tendencies of a time when the great\r\naffair was the organization of social life, and as a consequence the\r\nlimitation of individual and personal passions, were not favorable to\r\nthe development of lyrical poetry.\" These words are ripe with\r\nsuggestiveness, and duly weighed, they afford the true solution of the\r\noratorical and impersonal character of French literature for two long\r\ncenturies, when the social _genres_ in prose and poetry usurped\r\ndominion over the national mind. With our eye then upon the social\r\nconditions in France, the often-quoted words \"Malherbe a tué le\r\nlyrisme\" mean nothing more than that he struck a prostrate body.\r\n\r\nBefore turning from the sixteenth century it should perhaps be\r\nobserved that in discussing the comedy of that period the author might\r\nhave amplified his statement of Italian influences by at least a\r\nreference to the _Commedia dell' Arte_ which we find established in\r\nFrance in 1576, with its traditional repertory of stock characters,\r\nwhose antiquity ascends to the venerable times of the early Latin\r\nfarces, and whose survival the work of Molière, nay, even of\r\nBeaumarchais, will adequately attest. The last great figure that\r\ngreets us in the sixteenth century is Montaigne, and we feel a sense\r\nof disappointed curiosity when he is relentlessly dismissed at the end\r\nof the five pages to which he is entitled here. This singularly modern\r\ndoubter still smiles inscrutably at us through the misty centuries\r\nthat flow between us, and we would prefer to loiter with him by the\r\nway rather than pass him with a curt nod of recognition. But Montaigne\r\nis more important in the history of thought than in the history of\r\nliterature, so, crossing the threshold of the sixteenth century, we\r\nmeet the great lawgiver Malherbe, a Moses who really entered the\r\npromised land. Professor Dowden is eminently just and appreciative in\r\nhis judgment of this pedantic and unsympathetic figure, estimating his\r\nmerits and impartially noting his defects without presuming in his\r\ncharacter as literary historian to stamp them as such. Malherbe\r\nundeniably eliminated personality from poetry. Shall we regard this as\r\na defect? A century's masterpieces of objective art survive to say us\r\nnay, and if the critic's personal sympathies sway him to the side of\r\nlyric eloquence, the historian of literature observing without\r\nprejudice judges without rancor. \"The processes of Malherbe's art were\r\nessentially oratorical; the lyrical cry is seldom audible in his\r\nverse; it is the poetry of eloquence thrown into studied stanzas. But\r\nthe greater poetry of the seventeenth century in France, its odes, its\r\nsatires, its epistles, its noble dramatic scenes, and much of its\r\nprose literature, are of the nature of oratory; and for the progress\r\nof such poetry, and even of such prose, Malherbe prepared a highway.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now in the wake of Malherbe so thick do the great names throng\r\nthat I must perforce touch swiftly only on what seems to demand\r\namplification rather than dwell at length, as it would be much less\r\ndifficult to do, on the many admirable views the book contains. And\r\nfirst as regards the literary significance of René Descartes.\r\nProfessor Dowden places himself in accord with the customary views of\r\ncriticism in assigning to Descartes a preponderating influence on the\r\nliterary art of his century. \"The spirit of Descartes's work was in\r\nharmony with that of his time, and reacted upon literature. He sought\r\nfor general truths by the light of reason; he made clearness a\r\ncriterion of truth; he proclaimed man a spirit; he asserted the\r\nfreedom of the will. The art of the classical period sought also for\r\ngeneral truths, and subordinated imagination to reason. It turned away\r\nfrom ingenuities, obscurities, mysteries; it was essentially\r\nspiritualist; it represented the crises and heroic victories of the\r\nwill.\" This sounds reasonable, and is indeed in large measure in\r\naccordance with the actual conditions observable in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Yet there is no doubt that the literature of Louis XIV is\r\nmore intimately penetrated by the ascetic spirit of Jansenism as\r\nconveyed in the famous doctrines of Port-Royal, and it is to\r\nJansenism, and emphatically not to Cartesianism, that the literature\r\nof the seventeenth century owes that aspect of grandeur and moral\r\nserenity which characterizes it. To quote Brunetière: \"Pendant plus de\r\ncinquante ans, la conscience française, si l'on peut ainsi dire,\r\nincarnée dans le jansénisme, et rendue par lui à elle-même, a fait\r\ncontre la frivolité naturelle de la race le plus grand effort qu'elle\r\neut fait depuis les premiers temps de la réforme ou du calvinisme.\"\r\nIndeed, the tenaciously religious Jansenist spirit of the \"grand\r\nsiècle\" would have been universal were it not that Molière and La\r\nFontaine were apathetically indifferent, nay, sometimes actively\r\nhostile, to the general enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, examine in all brevity the fundamental doctrines of\r\nCartesianism. The terms are familiar enough. The identity of being and\r\nof thought. The objectivity of science. The all-powerfulness of\r\nreason. Progress to infinity. Optimism at all times. We can not fail\r\nto observe the significance of these categories, and how they contain\r\nthe germs of almost every great subject debated by the leviathians of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Yet the nation struggled long before it had\r\nstrength to shake the incubus of Jansenism from its back, and the\r\nstimulating work of Bayle had to be supported by events of actual\r\npolitical significance before the stringent and constraining dogmas of\r\ncatholicism relaxed their grasp on thought and conduct. The revocation\r\nof the Edict of Nantes, the Quietistic movement with its unseemly\r\nattendant episcopal quarrels, and finally the actual persecution of\r\nthe Jansenists, all pointed inevitably in one direction, and\r\nstimulating the anti-religious sentiment and opening the flood gates\r\nto immorality, induced a potent reaction of Cartesianism in the\r\nfundamental theories of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn his treatment of Corneille, Professor Dowden \"opens his hands only\r\nsufficiently to let out a portion of the truth he holds,\" but what he\r\nsays is admirable to a degree. Of his diction he writes: \"His mastery\r\nin verse of a masculine eloquence is unsurpassed; his dialogue of\r\nrapid statement and swift reply is like a combat with Roman short\r\nswords; in memorable single lines he explodes, as it were, a vast\r\ncharge of latent energy, and effects a clearance for the progress of\r\nhis action.\" This is well said, but hardly indicates how Corneille\r\nsoared so often in the region of Spanish bombast, or crept among the\r\ninsipid flowers of Italian preciosity; defects from which Racine's\r\nseverer Greek taste held him free.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing when we come to Boileau to find an English mind\r\nimpartial enough to do justice to the much-abused \"lawgiver of\r\nParnassus.\" Criticism has for so long deplored his narrowness that we\r\nrelish an encomium on his good sense. But beyond this there is an\r\nopinion which the general reader would be reluctant to admit, but\r\nwhich Professor Dowden has had the courage and the discernment to\r\nenforce, when he writes as follows: \"But for Paris itself, its various\r\naspects, its life, its types, its manners, he had the eye and the\r\nprecise rendering of a realist in art; his faithful objective touch is\r\nlike that of a Dutch painter.\" Let the incredulous merely turn to the\r\nsatires to appreciate the scope and truth of the remark. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine that a more brilliant and effective account of\r\nBoileau's work and influence could be presented within so limited a\r\nspace; yet might not the author have added that whereas Malherbe is\r\nthe representative of the aristocratic element in literature, Boileau\r\nis the first great incarnation in modern times of the bourgeois\r\nspirit?\r\n\r\nWith regard to La Fontaine it need only be observed that Professor\r\nDowden recognizes what French critics with repeated insistence\r\nemphasize, the cunning harmonies of his verse.\r\n\r\nMuch space is of right devoted to Molière, who with La Fontaine has\r\never been a stumbling-block to English criticism. Professor Dowden\r\nvoices our national feeling in refusing to consider him as a poet,\r\npreferring to emphasize his profound and healthy philosophy of life.\r\n_Tartufe_ he considers to be an attack on religious hypocrisy merely.\r\nIs not the interpretation perhaps correct which regards it as an\r\nattack on the intolerance and Puritanism of all religion, even the\r\nmost sincere?\r\n\r\nOnce again, in dealing with Racine, the author shows that subtle\r\ndiscernment in which his criticism abounds. He penetrates to the heart\r\nof the secret reason for the cabals that harassed Racine in the later\r\nyears of his dramatic activity, and which doubtless had their\r\ninfluence in enforcing his retirement. Have we ever sufficiently\r\nrealized that Boileau, Molière, and Racine were waging constant war\r\nagainst a rebirth of the _précieux_ spirit which threatened not only\r\nsociety with ridiculousness but literature with ruin? Such, indeed,\r\nwas the case, and in the eyes of the super-refined coterie that\r\ngrouped itself round the Duchesse de Bouillon, Boileau and his\r\nfellow-workers were innovators of a dangerous and revolutionary order.\r\nDoes not this idea carry us far from our preconceived notions of the\r\nnarrow conservatism that dominated the leaders of classical thought?\r\nReferring to the disastrous check of Racine's _Phèdre_, the author\r\nwrites: \"It is commonly said that Racine wrote in the conventional and\r\ncourtly taste of his own day. In reality his presentation of tragic\r\npassions in their terror and their truth shocked the aristocratic\r\nproprieties which were the mode. He was an innovator, and his audacity\r\nat once conquered and repelled.\" The point of view may seem extreme to\r\nus, and this vaunted realism may show pale and weakly when contrasted\r\nwith the grossness of much of the realism that prevails at the present\r\nday, or with the graphic directness of the best examples of the type.\r\nBut the words ring true if we are willing to accept the refined\r\npsychological realism of Racine as equally worthy to the title with\r\nthe physiological naturalism of our more scientific age. Our whole\r\nconception of Racine's art falls into line with this view, and his\r\nconstant solicitude for an easy and natural intrigue in the structure\r\nof his tragedies may be brought home to the same healthy impulse of\r\nhis mind. Was it not Faguet who maintained that so natural indeed were\r\nthe processes of his plots that a happy ending would have alone been\r\nneeded to make any of his tragedies, with some added modicum of wit,\r\nin all essential features a comedy that Molière might have penned? Mr.\r\nSaintsbury, on the other hand, in dealing with Racine is seemingly\r\nswayed by some innate prejudice, or he could hardly have denied the\r\npoet a high moral character, merely granting him the possession of\r\ngreat shrewdness and discernment. True passion, he remarks, was not\r\npopular with the crowd, but \"love-making, on the contrary, would draw,\r\nand love-making accordingly is the staple of all his plays.\" It is\r\nagainst this view, and against Mr. Saintsbury's further opinion that\r\nthe tragedy of Racine is at the furthest remove from an imitation of\r\nNature, that Professor Dowden makes a strong and timely protest.\r\n\r\nWhile applauding, however, the value of such novel opinions in English\r\ncriticism at least, we may suspect that in his desire to clinch his\r\narguments the author may have driven the nail too ruthlessly home. And\r\nso it would appear when we seek in vain for any statement which\r\ncontains the shadow of a justification for the existence of that\r\npowerful _précieux_ spirit against which the greater classicists\r\nrebelled. We are too inclined to take Molière's word for it that they\r\nwere solely ridiculous, forgetting the explicit reserve of his\r\npreface--\"aussi les véritables précieuses auraient tort de se piquer\r\nlorsqu'on joue les ridicules qui les imitent mal.\" So let us then give\r\nthe _Précieuses_ credit for what they did confer to the advantage of\r\nletters amid so much folly, and, weighing the matter carefully, their\r\ngift to literature amounts to this: First, amid much linguistic and\r\nmetaphorical pedantry they were free from the equally damaging and\r\nridiculous pedantry of a labored erudition which pervaded the\r\nliterature of the day. In the second place, whether we regard it as an\r\nadvantage or the contrary, their influence made directly _against_ the\r\nlicentiousness of the _esprit gaulois_, and _for_ politeness and\r\ndecency in expression; and as a third count in their favor can we\r\ndoubt that straining as they did to express the _nuances_ of sentiment\r\nand gallantry, they were instrumental in stimulating that ardor of\r\nmental analysis which is of all things the distinguishing mark of the\r\ncentury? A word finally might have been said with a view to\r\nelucidating the inherent divergence of the _précieux_ spirit from our\r\nown Euphuism, from the Marinism of Italy, or the Gongorism of Spain; a\r\ndivergence due certainly to the fact that the _précieuses_ allied\r\nthemselves to, and accordingly strengthened, that spirit of social\r\ncoherence so characteristic of the life and letters of the time in\r\nFrance, whereas the influences of similar movements abroad were more\r\ntransitory, inasmuch as in some degree more isolated and tentative.\r\n\r\nThe chapter devoted to the seventeenth century closes with a critical\r\nreview of the series of great preachers and theologians who have left\r\ntheir mark more or less upon the development of thought, while their\r\nliterary significance can be comparatively slighted in a history of\r\nthis kind; and the chapter which discusses the transition to the\r\neighteenth century broaches questions of such large issue that an\r\nexhaustive treatment of them was not to be expected. Such are the\r\nmemorable quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, and the\r\n_philosophe_ idea of perfectibility and human progress. The chapter\r\ncloses with an account of the great protagonist and pioneer in the\r\nwarfare against Christianity, the patient, plodding, dangerous Pierre\r\nBayle. So effectually was his teaching absorbed by Voltaire and the\r\nencyclopedists that he is read no longer; but low as his flame has\r\nsunk, he remains one of the beacons lighting us over the lurid\r\nthreshold of the century of strife.\r\n\r\nWe are in safe hands when it is Professor Dowden who guides us on the\r\nhighways and bypaths of the eighteenth century, but by very reason of\r\nhis accurate knowledge of the ground whereon he treads we are\r\ndisappointed when he fails to point out to us some special feature of\r\nthe landscape. Beauties we could hardly hope to meet with on our\r\njourney. There was not sap enough in that arid soil to nourish\r\nflowers, or send a flush of living green over hill and valley. The\r\nmost serious omission is to have left entirely out of account the\r\nexceedingly interesting reactionary influences that leaped back and\r\nforth across the Channel when Marivaux's romances were devoured in\r\nEngland, and Richardson's _Pamela_ was in every French pocket large\r\nenough to hold it. It is in itself still an open question which of\r\nthese two authors exerted the initial influence on the other, although\r\neighteenth-century criticism invariably held that in _Marianne_\r\nRichardson found his inspiration.\r\n\r\nA great deal of interest attaches to an explanation of the causes of\r\nLe Sage's decline in popularity, and this question likewise Professor\r\nDowden has not adequately presented. Le Sage saw the imperative need\r\nof mediating between the stilted heroic romances _à la Scudéry_ and\r\nthe grotesque travesties of Scarron and Furetière. Inspired by the\r\npicaroon romances of Spain, he produced, amid much inferior work, _Gil\r\nBlas_, a masterpiece in its kind. The plot is loose-jointed, the\r\ncomposition _nil_, but the book teems with such verve and vigor that\r\nit still pulses with an abounding life when Marivaux and Richardson\r\nslumber on our shelves. Yet we must admit that the characters are\r\nvagabonds, and the sentiment not without coarseness. Love when not\r\nslighted is ridiculed, and metaphysical analysis and moral\r\ndisquisitions are both refreshingly absent from the book. Hence Le\r\nSage's claims on our consideration as the progenitor of naturalism in\r\nromance, but on this account also the reactionary wave against which\r\nhe had to buffet in his declining years. Marivaux, on the other hand,\r\nsaw the need of mediating between the stilted heroics of Scudéry and\r\nwhat he deemed the ignoble realism of Le Sage. In this resolve he\r\nelevated the characters to _bourgeois_ rank, and abandoning the empty\r\nlove rhetoric of the old romances, he brought the acuteness of an\r\nanalytic mind to bear on the exploitation of the tender passion; and a\r\nconscientious though desultory effort is made to study subtle phases\r\nof character in the light of surrounding circumstances. Despite the\r\nartificial _précieuse_ qualities of his style, and the unfinished\r\ncondition of his novels, Marivaux enjoyed an extraordinary popularity\r\nin his day. The same problem repeats itself on a larger scale when we\r\ntransfer our attention to Richardson, whose works, translated and\r\npopularized by Prévost, were read with the greatest avidity in France.\r\nWere not these such influences as Professor Dowden's profound\r\nknowledge of English literature would have qualified him to illustrate\r\nwith more precision than has yet been brought to bear upon them; and\r\nwas it not in point of fact almost imperative for him to deal\r\nseriously with such an important theme in the international literary\r\nhistory of nations?\r\n\r\nThe pages which Professor Dowden devotes to Voltaire, although\r\nbrilliant, are not sufficiently suggestive of the extraordinary\r\ninfluence which that most celebrated of writers exercised. It was in\r\nno uncritical spirit that Mr. Morley wrote: \"The existence, character,\r\nand career of this extraordinary person constituted in themselves a\r\nnew and prodigious era. The peculiarities of his individual genius\r\nchanged the mind and spiritual conformation of France, and in a less\r\ndegree of the whole of the West, with as far-spreading and invincible\r\nan effect as if the work had been wholly done, as it was actually\r\naided, by the sweep of deep-lying collective forces. A new type of\r\nbelief, and of its shadow, disbelief, was stamped by the impression of\r\nhis character and work into the intelligence and feeling of his own\r\nand modern times.\" Nor will Villemain be accused of rapt enthusiasm\r\nwhen he writes, \"C'est le plus puissant renovateur des esprits depuis\r\nLuther, et l'homme qui a mis le plus en commun les idées de l'Europe\r\npar sa gloire, sa longue vie, son merveilleux esprit et son\r\nuniverselle clarté.\" The strangest fact to contemplate with regard to\r\nthis unrivaled popularity, this astonishing range of influence, is\r\nthat it truly constitutes an apotheosis of superficiality. And this in\r\nno disparaging spirit of Carlylese disdain for clear ideas around\r\nwhich hang no mists of oracular obscurity, but rather by way of\r\ntribute to a heart that beat responsively to human suffering, to a\r\nmind keenly sensible of human wrongs. Voltaire rejected the subtleties\r\nof metaphysical thought, was indeed incapable of attaining to the\r\nheights of speculative contemplation; he was only preternaturally\r\nsensitive to the moral defects of this imperfect world, and determined\r\nto bend all his efforts to the alleviation of injustice and of crime.\r\nAs a further concession to his superficiality as a thinker we may\r\nfrankly admit his incapacity to originate new ideas. His mind indeed\r\nwas extraordinarily receptive, his intellectual curiosity unlimited,\r\nand hostile critics have availed themselves of this very receptivity\r\nas a medium of attack upon his originality. They are free to pursue\r\nhim on that score, but it does not appreciably detract from his\r\ngreatness in the eyes of posterity to recognize that Bayle before him\r\nhad preached the doctrine of toleration; that Montesquieu had\r\nadvocated the abolition of torture and of slavery, and the sanctity of\r\nsocial institutions, or that Boileau forsooth had upheld the dignity\r\nof classical formulas in matters literary. It is rather in the\r\nmobility of his mind and in the impressionability of his temperament\r\nthat we should seek for an explanation of a philosophical disturbance\r\nin his ideas. It is not an actual mental confusion that I refer to,\r\nfor his diction is never more limpid than in the expression of his\r\neasy personal beliefs; but a certain intellectual inconsistency in his\r\nhabits of thought makes it impossible for us to hold him down to any\r\ndefinite set of opinions which we can regard as a genuine confession\r\nof faith. And this is a vital characteristic of skeptical minds of his\r\nstamp, swiftly receptive, and as open as the day to each new\r\nintellectual impulse as it arises. Thus we must attribute to his\r\ncapacity for mental development, as well as to the narrowness of his\r\nphilosophical range, the many contradictions which his writings\r\nexhibit in such matters of intellectual belief as are wont to give a\r\npermanent bias of thought to minds less volatile and alert. Are we to\r\nregard him as an optimist or a pessimist? a believer in immortality or\r\ndevotee of annihilation? a fatalist or spiritualist in history? an\r\nadvocate of free will or determinism? We can not say, and M. Faguet\r\nhas amused himself with supporting each of these opinions in turn upon\r\nits appropriate text, whose clearness is beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nIf there was one set of opinions to which Voltaire may be said to have\r\nsomewhat consistently adhered I may instance his vague and insipid\r\ndeism, which relegated to God the rôle of an absentee landlord in this\r\npoor world which he created and governs by absolute law, but in whose\r\naffairs he only intervenes when the death rent is to be collected. He\r\ninfers a creative God from the argument of the clockmaker and the\r\nclock, but takes extreme pleasure in showing how sadly the poor\r\nmachine is out of order. His idea of the social utility of an avenging\r\nand rewarding God must of course be regarded as a freak of\r\nintellectual caprice, and yet his timid political instincts made him\r\nregard the terrorizing influence of the doctrine of hell with some\r\ncomplacency as a restraining force upon the unthinking masses. The\r\nstory is well known of the atheistic conversation between D'Alembert\r\nand Condorcet at Voltaire's table, who summarily dismissed the\r\nservants from the room with the remark: \"Maintenant, messieurs, vous\r\npouvez continuer. Je craignais seulement d'être égorgé cette nuit.\"\r\nThe _Dictionnaire philosophique_ confirms the flippant utilitarian\r\npoint of view, which we must beware of regarding as a personal\r\nconviction. \"I insist particularly on the immortality of the soul,\r\nbecause there is nothing to which I hold more than the idea of hell.\r\nWe have to do with a host of rogues who have never thought; a crowd of\r\npetty people, brutes and drunkards and thieves. Preach to them if you\r\nwill that there is no hell and that the soul is mortal. As for me I\r\nwill cry in their ears that they are damned if they rob me.\" It is\r\nneedless to add that convictions of this eminently practical nature\r\ndid not seriously hamper Voltaire in his anti-religious crusade.\r\n\r\nTo every branch of letters Voltaire brought the same splendid\r\nqualities of mind, and need I add the same defective qualities of\r\nconscience and carelessness of the truth when his personal glory or\r\nhis material advancement were concerned? The sordid pages of his life\r\nwould weary us in the turning, yet his native generosity and sympathy\r\nincline us to charity; and it is wonderful how his never-failing wit\r\ncan temper his vindictiveness for us, now that the sting has lost its\r\nliving poison.\r\n\r\nI have referred to Professor Dowden's unsatisfactory treatment of the\r\ninternational reactions which characterize the literary history of the\r\neighteenth century. There is another omission which I have remarked in\r\nthe book on a reperusal of the pages devoted to Rousseau and the\r\nencyclopedists. It might have been easily within the scope of a\r\nliterary story of even moderate dimensions to have more explicitly\r\naccounted for the crumbling of the old classical ideal, to have shown\r\nthat the once impregnable citadel of classical art was rotten at the\r\nbase, and that those who still defended the imaginary stronghold were\r\nthemselves the unconscious agents of its destruction. With reference\r\nto the irreligious influences of Cartesianism and the philosophical\r\nsystem of Bayle I shall say no more, save that the evident loss in\r\nprestige of the traditional religious faith, combined as it was with\r\nthe rapid decentralization of the sovereign power in the state, must\r\nperforce make impossible the survival of literature on the old\r\nnational basis. Again, in point of pure art a decline was inevitable\r\nin connection with the revival of Cartesianism among writers of the\r\nstamp of Fontenelle; for their prestige was synchronous with the\r\ntriumph of the modern party in the famous quarrel; and no student of\r\nthe _Art Poétique_ will fail to appreciate the æsthetical significance\r\nof an abandonment of classical standards of taste as an unimpeachable\r\ncanon of art. Defending as Boileau did the supreme value of reason and\r\ngood sense, what justification could he have found for poetry unless\r\nhe had proved to the satisfaction of his generation that poetry better\r\nthan any other mode of expression could render permanent the\r\npromptings of the diviner reason, as witness the eternal monuments of\r\nancient art in the domain of poetry? The triumph of the moderns then\r\nturned men's faces in other directions, and whether literary art\r\nshould henceforward advance or decline, it must at least strike root\r\nin a newer soil.\r\n\r\nThe inroads of sensibility into French literature, as exemplified in\r\nMarivaux and Prévost in the thirties, followed swiftly by the rank and\r\nfile, also wrought havoc in the old classical method, though this fact\r\nmay not without further reflection be conceded. But in the broad realm\r\nof psychological observation, where classic art had reigned supreme,\r\nthe influx of a certain morbid sensibility strangely warped the mental\r\nvision of the observer. Diderot, a veritable sinner himself in this\r\nrespect, admits as much in an unguarded moment: \"L'homme sensible est\r\ntrop abandonné à la merci de son diaphragme ... pour être un profond\r\nobservateur et conséquemment un sublime imitateur de la nature.\" Every\r\none knows Voltaire's naïve statement which bears condemnatory evidence\r\nto the bluntness of his psychology. \"La nature est partout la même.\"\r\nAnd is it not, we ask, this enigmatical typical man, out of space and\r\nout of time, for whom the chimerical theories of universal\r\nperfectibility were soon to be woven?\r\n\r\nIt is incontestably true, then, that the character of human\r\nobservation undergoes a sensible alteration in the course of the\r\ncentury, and that whereas the individual man had been heretofore\r\nstudied inasmuch as he was in himself of typical value, henceforward\r\nnot man the individual will be the object of study, but the\r\nobservation of human relations will usurp the field, and psychological\r\nanalysis will yield to social investigation.\r\n\r\nI would add a word or two by way of conclusion to illustrate how the\r\nencyclopedists in their propaganda, aided in part by the coincident\r\ninfluence of Rousseau, established ideals of thought and conduct which\r\nwere in the most violent contrast to the ideals cherished in the\r\npreceding century. Of course, we readily understand that the\r\nencyclopedists threw to the four corners of heaven the outworn respect\r\nof religious and political tradition. Furthermore, we may ask\r\nourselves what it is which in a sense makes Molière and La Fontaine\r\nisolated in their century; and the answer will not be far to seek when\r\nwe realize that these two alone of all their fellows urged the\r\nsuspected authority of instinct as a sufficient guide for conduct. Yet\r\nhow far were not even these bolder spirits from the natural man of\r\nRousseau or of Diderot?\r\n\r\nThe views of the two centuries concerning the authority of reason seem\r\nat first sight to coincide, yet, while bearing Boileau in mind, we can\r\nconfidently assert that the doctrine of the sovereignty of reason was\r\nnot established as a principle of thought until the culminating years\r\nof the eighteenth century. Pascal's \"taisez-vous raison imbécile\"\r\nindicates how attempered and attenuated by spiritual faith were the\r\ndictates of pure reason in his day, and the reason of Boileau, as I\r\nhave already observed, was strongly tinged with æstheticism. I need\r\nnot, with reference to eighteenth-century reason worship, go further\r\nthan to refer the curious of enlightenment on the subject to the\r\nmasterly works of Morley on the period in question, in which it is\r\nprecisely this unflinching devotion to reason or unreason (if the sage\r\nof Chelsea will have it thus) which stimulates his calm and logical\r\ntemperament to positive enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nA last element of contrast between the centuries is of interest in\r\nconnection with the habitual mode of thought which Godwin and his\r\npolitical disciple Shelley borrowed from eighteenth-century French\r\nsources with reference to the true relations subsisting between laws\r\nand morals. The seventeenth-century mind held tenaciously enough to\r\nthe theory that it is the _moeurs_ of a nation that inspire the laws,\r\nbut the encyclopedists were inspired in their undying hope of\r\namelioration and human progress to perfectibility by the contrary\r\ntheory that men, after all, are only bad because the laws have made\r\nthem so.\r\n\r\nIt may be conceded, then, that these broad relations of literary\r\nmovements one with the other, the conflict of converging tendencies,\r\nand the more evident causes of the growth and decay of powerful\r\nmanifestations of a nation's thought, are of quite sufficient moment\r\nto have merited fuller treatment at the hands of the eminent critic\r\nwho has in all other respects fulfilled his task so admirably, that\r\nhaving regard to the necessary conditions of the subject, it would be\r\nabove criticism if anything could be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOTANY OF SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS H. MACBRIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe universality of Shakespeare is the common remark of critics. Other\r\ngreat men have been versatile; Shakespeare alone is universal. He\r\nalone of all great men seems to have been able to follow his own\r\nadvice, \"to hold as it were the mirror up to Nature.\" On the clear\r\nsurface of his thought, as on a deep Alpine lake, the whole shore lies\r\nreflected--not alone the clouds, the sky, the woods, the castles, the\r\nrocks, the mountain path by which the shepherd strolls; not alone the\r\nbroad highway by which may march the king in splendor the peasant with\r\nhis wain; but even the humbler objects by the still water's edge, the\r\ntrodden grass, the fluttering sedge, the broken reed, the tiniest\r\nflower, all things, all Nature in action or repose finds counterpart\r\nwithin the glassy depths.\r\n\r\nHence it is that no man, at least no English-speaking man, reads\r\nShakespeare wrong. Everybody understands him. Here is a sort of\r\nAnglo-Saxon Bible in which, so far as the world goes, every soul finds\r\nhimself, with all his hopes, his doubts, his whims, depicted. We are\r\ntherefore not surprised that everybody claims a share in Shakespeare;\r\nrather claims the poet as his own. The Protestant is sure that\r\nShakespeare despised the hierarchy; the Romanist is quite as certain\r\nthat he loved the Church. There exists an essay to prove him a\r\nPresbyterian; another to show that the great dramatist was a\r\nUniversalist. A volume has been written to prove the man a soldier;\r\nanother that he was a lawyer, a printer, a fisherman, a freemason; and\r\nhere are five or six articles to show that Shakespeare was a\r\ngardener.[U]\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: In preparation of this article the author has consulted\r\nchiefly the following: John Gerarde, The Herball or General Historie\r\nof Plants, 1597; Shakspere, Edward Dowden, 1872; William Shakespeare,\r\nWorks, Globe edition, 1867; Natural History of Shakespeare, Bessie\r\nMayou, 1877; Shakespeare's England, William Winter, 1894; The Plant\r\nlore and Garden-craft of Shakespeare, H. F. Ellacombe, 1896; The\r\nGardener's Chronicle, sundry pamphlets, and shorter articles.]\r\n\r\nAll this simply means that the poet had a marvelous faculty for close\r\nobserving; that his vision was accurate, his instinct wonderfully\r\ntrue. It may be therefore worth our while to study for a little this\r\nremarkable man from the standpoint of a naturalist, to see how he who\r\nso vividly paints a passion can paint a flower; how the man who limns\r\na character, till beyond the photograph it starts to actuality, will\r\ncatch the essential feature of some natural truth.\r\n\r\nWe shall nowhere lack for material. The plays are full of references\r\nto plants and flowers of every sort. England in Shakespeare's day, as\r\nnow, was a land of bloom, and the poet but reflects the loveliness of\r\nbeauty and color spread about him. But he does something more. He is\r\nnot content with flashes of color and breathings of odor, he goes into\r\ndetail and gives us the individual plant unmistakably. In his\r\ndescription he shows an exactitude, a discriminating perception that,\r\nhad it been turned to Nature's problems seriously at all, must at once\r\nhave transformed the science of his age. But Shakespeare was not a man\r\nof science; he was a poet. In his views of Nature he resembles the\r\ngreat poets of the world, notably Goethe; and, like Goethe, he not\r\ninfrequently outruns the science of his time, uses his imagination,\r\ndivining things invisible. Moreover, Shakespeare's plants are living\r\nthings; they form a garden, not a herbarium. They stand before us in\r\nmultitudes, so that it is difficult for the present purpose to know\r\nwhat to select. We must be content with a few specimen forms brought\r\nout in quotations no more extensive than seems necessary to the\r\nargument. Of course, there are many plants to-day discussed of which\r\nShakespeare never heard. He does not speak of many sorts of fungi, of\r\nslime molds, microbes; he knew nothing about these. The microscope had\r\nhardly been invented, and the unseen world was as yet largely\r\npersonified. And yet Shakespeare has not failed to note the visible\r\nsigns of some of our microscopic forms. Critics have wasted their time\r\nand the patience of mankind in an effort to identify Hebona, the\r\n\"leperous distilment\" poured into the porches of the royal ear. Almost\r\nprofitless are such discussions. Yet we may note that we have here to\r\ndo with an effect; the means of producing it need not be too closely\r\nquestioned. Before the rush of action, the weird setting, the voice of\r\nan apparition, the excited audience cares not what the mysterious vial\r\nmay contain--ebony, henbane, yew, or whether it were entirely empty.\r\nWhat is called for is a speedy and mysterious taking off. Had the\r\nscene been laid in Italy, the effect had been reached by the fateful\r\nprick of a jeweled pin, some ring upon a Borgian finger whose pressure\r\nwas the paralysis of death. But the king died of no such curari. Note\r\nthe symptoms (Hamlet, i, 5, 64-73):\r\n\r\n      \"The leperous distilment; whose effect\r\n      Holds such an enmity with blood of man\r\n      That swift as quicksilver it courses through\r\n      The natural gates and alleys of the body,\r\n      And with a sudden vigour it doth posset\r\n      And curd, like eager droppings into milk,\r\n      The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;\r\n      And a most instant tetter barked about,\r\n      Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,\r\n      All my smooth body.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the symptoms of blood-poisoning, vividly portrayed; of some\r\ncontagion, communicable by infection. In foul old London Shakespeare\r\nhad doubtless seen endemic, zymotic diseases of every description, and\r\ndrew his picture from the life. Royal blood is notoriously unsound,\r\nroyal habit leaves the porches of royal ears especially exposed. On\r\nour supposition the vial need not have contained very much, not even\r\nebony. The dramatist had plenty of mystery ready to his hand, and the\r\nHebona is perhaps intentionally ambiguous. Bacterial diseases were of\r\nold called plagues; they fell from heaven. Listen to King Lear:\r\n\r\n      \"Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air\r\n      Hang fated o'er men's faults, light on my daughters!\"\r\n\r\nOr Caliban:\r\n\r\n      \"All the infections that the sun sucks up\r\n      From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him\r\n      By inch-meal a disease!\"\r\n\r\nOr they were attributed, as already intimated, to unseen personal\r\nagencies:\r\n\r\n     \"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew, and\r\n     walks till the first cock; he gives the web and the pin, squints\r\n     the eye, and makes the hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and\r\n     hurts the poor creature of earth.\"\r\n\r\nI quote this latter rather also to show the accuracy and compass of\r\nShakespeare's vision. How many people, not farmers, have seen wheat\r\nwhitened by the blight! And that is exactly the description, white not\r\n\"to the harvest,\" but whiter still to sterility and death.\r\n\r\nBut leaving aside all microscopic forms which may or may not be\r\nincidentally touched upon everywhere, we may turn our attention next\r\nto cryptogamic plants which are positively defined. The sudden\r\nspringing of mushrooms, for instance, especially at night, so unreal\r\nand yet realities withal, made their creation a suitable trick for\r\nProspero:\r\n\r\n                        \"You demi-puppets that\r\n      By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\r\n      Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime\r\n      Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\r\n      To hear the solemn curfew.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"green sour ringlets on the fields whereof the ewe not bites\" are\r\n\"fairy rings.\" The same thing appears in the speech of Dame Quickly:\r\n\r\n      \"And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,\r\n      Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring;\r\n      The expressure that it bears, green let it be,\r\n      More fertile-fresh than all the field to see.\"\r\n\r\nFungi, toadstools, mushrooms, and so forth, are fructifications only;\r\nthe vegetative part of the plants permeates the soil, feeds on its\r\norganic matter, and spreads almost equally, we may assume, in all\r\ndirections from the point of starting. When now this vegetative growth\r\nhas accumulated energy to form fruit, the sporocarps or mushrooms rise\r\nall around at the limits of activity; hence, in a circle.\r\n\r\nThe fungi cut a small figure in Shakespeare--i. e., considering their\r\nnumbers and almost omnipresence. But we must remember that they were\r\nat that time studied by few, their significance and interest little\r\nsuspected. They formed part of the realm of the world unseen; they\r\ncame and went at the instance of powers unknown, mostly personified,\r\nimaginary, a misty population, the thought of which kept for long ages\r\nthe childhood of our race in terror. Shakespeare saw the forms of\r\nunstudied plants, everything visible to the naked eye, and really\r\nomitted very little. He speaks of mosses--the lichens were included\r\nwith them--chiefly as indicative of age in the object in which they\r\nrest:\r\n\r\n      \"Under an oak, whose boughs were mossed with age\r\n      And high top bald with dry antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nThen again he simply touches them, but in such a way as to reveal his\r\nfull appreciation of their beauty, as in Cymbeline, iv, 2. For the\r\ndecoration of Imogen's grave the ruddock would bring flowers--\r\n\r\n                      \"... bring thee all this;\r\n      Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,\r\n      To winter-ground thy corse.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"furred moss\" to \"winter-ground thy corse\" is exquisite.\r\n\r\nFerns, though so much larger, so handsome, and in our day so\r\nall-attractive, failed generally to impress our fathers.\r\n\r\nButler, writing in 1670, has this to say:\r\n\r\n      \"They spring like fern, that infant weed,\r\n      Equivocally without a seed,\r\n      And have no possible foundation\r\n      But merely in th' imagination.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as far as Shakespeare was concerned, ferns answered his purpose\r\nwithout seed just as well as with such visible means of perpetuity.\r\nHis only reference is I Henry, iv, where Gadshill says:\r\n\r\n      \"We have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk invisible\";\r\n\r\nand Chamberlain replies:\r\n\r\n      \"Nay, by my faith, I think you are more belonging to the\r\n      Night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection Ellacombe suggests the doctrine of signatures. The\r\nGod of Nature had written for us his human children prescriptions all\r\nover the leafy world. The remedy indicated by its form its own\r\napplication. Thus a heart-shaped leaf was good medicine for cardiac\r\ntroubles, a lung-like leaf was good for consumption, a lungwort in\r\nfact, and so a liverwort, a spleenwort, and the like. Gerarde, and, in\r\nfact, all the old medical writers throughout the centuries, are full\r\nof this. Now, what more natural than that a plant which could thus\r\nperpetuate itself age after age by means invisible should be able to\r\nconfer the much-sought gift of invisibility, the power to disappear\r\nand reappear at pleasure? Many people so believed. Shakespeare appears\r\nto have been skeptical.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to the flowering plants: the amount of material at our\r\ndisposal, as already indicated, is immense. Shakespeare was evidently\r\na great lover of flowers simply as such. His pages from first to last\r\nare ornate with color, almost redolent of roses, lilies, eglantine,\r\nwith every conceivable metaphor and trope--\"the bud of love,\" the\r\n\"nettle of danger,\" the \"flower of safety.\" Their lovely shapes are\r\never before him; he is spellbound with their beauty. \"England itself\r\nis a sea-walled garden.\" Grammatical forms may vanish, if only the\r\nflower may live. Compare Cymbeline, ii, 3:\r\n\r\n      \"Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,\r\n        And Phoebus 'gins arise,\r\n      His steeds to water at those springs\r\n        On chaliced flowers that _lies_.\"\r\n\r\nThe image of the morning flowers, the fiery steeds that drink them\r\ndry, shall fascinate us so that we forget the grammar. It will not do\r\nto say lie; the word must rhyme with \"arise,\" and further on with\r\n\"eyes\":\r\n\r\n      \"And winking Mary-buds begin\r\n        To ope their golden eyes:\r\n      With everything that pretty is,\r\n        My lady sweet arise.\"\r\n\r\nFor the Queen of the Fairies he spreads this sort of a couch:\r\n\r\n      \"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\r\n      Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\r\n      Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,\r\n      With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:\r\n      There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\r\n      Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight,\" etc.\r\n\r\nSuch cases reveal the impress, the healthy, happy impress which Nature\r\ncould exercise on this the foremost man of all the world, the harmony\r\nbetween Nature and Nature's child. All the plants in the last\r\nquotation are wild flowers, except the musk-roses, and these are so\r\ncommon in England as to be almost wild. The eglantine was the\r\nsweetbrier, said to be wild in all the southern part of the island and\r\npopular in the literature of all recorded centuries. Gerarde describes\r\nas follows: \"The leaves are glittering, of beautiful green color, of\r\nsmell most pleasant.... The fruit when it is ripe maketh most pleasant\r\nmeats, and banqueting dishes, as tarts and such like, the making\r\nwhereof I commit to the cunning cook, and teeth to eat them in the\r\nrich man's mouth.\"\r\n\r\nThe sweetness of the leaf of the eglantine is referred to by\r\nShakespeare in another passage which I venture to quote now for\r\nanother purpose, to show the accuracy of his description as applied to\r\nsimple flowers. The lines are from the scene quoted before. Arviragus\r\nand Guiderius would bury the swooning Imogen. They think her dead\r\n(Cymbeline, iv, 2):\r\n\r\n      \"I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack\r\n      The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor\r\n      The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor\r\n      The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,\r\n      Out-sweetened not thy breath.\"\r\n\r\nPrimroses when pale are the palest of all withering plants. The\r\nflowers change color with maturity, especially after fertilization.\r\nThe paleness of the primrose is the pallor of decay. But the azure\r\nharebell--behold it waving on its slender stipe beneath the shade of\r\nsome great rock--who can look into its delicate cerulean cup again and\r\nnot bethink him of the blue-veined eyelid sleep that falls upon our\r\nhuman flowers!\r\n\r\nThe same accuracy of detail is evinced in many other places. Take, for\r\ninstance, Shakespeare's description of the violet all the way through.\r\nIt moves him chiefly by its odor (King John, iv, 2):\r\n\r\n      \"To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\r\n      To throw a perfume on the violet,\r\n      To smooth the ice, to add another hue\r\n      Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light\r\n      To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\r\n      Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we have violets dim, and violets blue, and purple\r\nviolets, and more particularly \"blue-veined\" violets, as if the poet\r\nlooked with a lens into the very throat of the flower which Frenchmen\r\ncall a thought. \"And there is pansies--that's for thoughts.\" His\r\ndescription of the elm is equally exact (Midsummer-Night's Dream, iv,\r\n1, 47-49):\r\n\r\n      \"So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle\r\n      Gently entwist; the female ivy so\r\n      Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing better than that, as you may prove by examining the\r\ntwigs of even some of our American species; the cork elm, for\r\ninstance. The hawthorn, the cedar, and the pine and the oak\r\nespecially, are most naturally treated. These are Shakespeare's\r\nfamiliar trees. The cedar of Shakespeare is the cedar of Lebanon,\r\ncommonly planted throughout Europe since the time of the Crusades.\r\nShakespeare had probably seen specimens in England. He uses it as the\r\ntype of all that is great and fine. One author thinks he copies\r\nEzekiel, chapter xxxi. The pine was beside him all the while. He knew\r\nthe secret of the pine knot, and well describes it (Troilus and\r\nCressida, i, 3):\r\n\r\n          \"... checks and disasters\r\n      Grow in the veins of actions highest reared,\r\n      As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,\r\n      Deflect the sound pine and divert his grain\r\n      Tortive and errant from his course of growth.\"\r\n\r\nAny one who has ever examined the case, or even one who has handled\r\nknotty lumber, has seen the wood fiber run around the persistent base\r\nof some dead limb, and can appreciate these lines.\r\n\r\nAll these quotations show that Shakespeare used his own eyes and used\r\nthem well. He saw the real distinctions of things, the hoariness on\r\nthe willow leaf. He found character in the oak as in the king, and\r\nbeauty in both. In many of his notices of natural objects, however,\r\nthe poet is not the original observer. He often uses current opinions,\r\nfancies, dreams, for these also were the realities in his day, quite\r\nas much sometimes as oaks and forests. There is concerning plants a\r\nsort of orthodox mythology, and thousands of years have sometimes\r\ncontributed to the reputation born by a single species. A curious\r\nillustration is found in what Shakespeare has to say about the\r\nmandrake (Antony and Cleopatra, i, 5):\r\n\r\n      \"Give me to drink mandragora.\r\n                                Why, madam?\r\n      That I might sleep out this great gap of time.\"\r\n\r\nOthello, iii, 3:\r\n\r\n      \"Not poppy, nor mandragora,\r\n      Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,\r\n      Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\n      Which thou owedst yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nJuliet, reflecting on her proposed entombment in the dark grave of the\r\nCapulets, exclaims (Romeo and Juliet, iv, 3):\r\n\r\n      \"Alack, alack! is it not like that I,\r\n      So early waking, what with loathsome smells,\r\n      And shrieks like mandrake's torn out of the earth,\r\n      That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:\r\n      Or, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\r\n      Environèd with all these hideous fears?\"\r\n\r\nThe mandrake _Atropa officinalis_ belongs to the _Solanaceæ_, and,\r\nlike others of the family, has narcotic properties. This was doubtless\r\nknown to Shakespeare, as in the passage cited he compares the mandrake\r\nwith the poppy. The groaning and shrieking are, of course, the purest\r\nsuperstition. The root of the mandrake was supposed to resemble the\r\nhuman form. The favorite habitat assigned to the plant was the foot of\r\nthe gallows, and men believed that in some way the bodies of criminals\r\nwere reproduced in the growing plant; their very pains and cries\r\nrenewed, especially for him who profanely dared to pull the mandrake\r\nfrom the earth. The curious may consult Gerarde.\r\n\r\nThese ideas, it is needless to say, are very old; Pliny refers to\r\nthem, and, if I recollect well, Vergil has his hero pull up some plant\r\namid the strangest of sights and sounds. With these old myths are tied\r\nup, perchance, the mandrakes of King James's version. Nay, the\r\nsuperstition still survives; look at the woodcut in Webster's\r\nUnabridged, and you will discover that the artist who set out to\r\nillustrate the word mandrake for that somewhat venerable authority was\r\nby no means able to free himself from the ancient spell. Credulity is\r\nevermore a factor in the compound called human nature. Men love to be\r\nfooled, or to find some support for belief in manifest absurdity.\r\nThere is nothing so silly but has its advocates among men who ought to\r\nknow better.\r\n\r\nA year or two since, a man brought from Ohio to the University of Iowa\r\nan innocent five-parted, digitate, black fungus. It was treasured in\r\nalcohol. Why? Because of its origin. An honest mechanic meeting with\r\naccident lost his fingers under the surgeon's knife. The amputated\r\nmembers were neglected, but presently discovered and duly buried in\r\nthe garden. The following spring from the \"identical spot\" uprose a\r\nswarthy hand, black without, white within. The hand was a perfect\r\n_main-de-gloire_ for that sensation-loving community. The matter was\r\ndiscussed in newspapers. A long and careful account of the wonder was\r\nprepared, put in print and circulated among the friends of the\r\ndeceased--fingers! \"What fools we mortals be!\" For sheer superstition\r\nand crass stupidity who may say that the nineteenth century may not\r\nyet discount the days of the virgin Queen?\r\n\r\nBut I said at the outset that Shakespeare had in some instances\r\nanticipated modern scientific teaching. To illustrate this in its most\r\nstriking instance, I am compelled to offer a somewhat long quotation\r\n(Winter's Tale, iv, 4, 76-106):\r\n\r\n      \"POLIXENES. Shepherdess,\r\n      A fair one are you, well you fit our ages\r\n      With flowers of winter.\r\n\r\n      PERDITA. Sir, the year growing ancient,\r\n      Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth\r\n      Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o' the season\r\n      Are our carnation and streaked gillyvors,\r\n      Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind\r\n      Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not\r\n      To get slips of them.\r\n\r\n      POLIXENES. Wherefore, gentle maiden,\r\n      Do you neglect them?\r\n\r\n      PERDITA. For I have heard it said\r\n      There is an art which in their piedness shares\r\n      With great creating nature.\r\n\r\n      POLIXENES. Say there be;\r\n      Yet nature is made better by no mean,\r\n      But nature makes that mean: so, over that art\r\n      Which you say adds to nature, is an art\r\n      That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\r\n      A gentler scion to the wildest stock,\r\n      And make conceive a bark of baser kind\r\n      By bud of nobler race: this is an art\r\n      Which does mend nature, change it rather, but\r\n      The art itself is nature.\r\n\r\n      PERDITA. So it is.\r\n\r\n      POLIXENES. Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,\r\n      And do not call them bastards.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have brought out very distinctly the effect of\r\ncross-fertilization in flowers, the result of grafting and the\r\ndevelopment of varieties. Better than that, we have here the\r\nrecognition of that tendency in organisms to vary that lies at the\r\nvery root of the development of species. Natural selection, survival\r\nof the fittest, were impossible were it not true that \"Nature is made\r\nbetter by no mean but Nature makes that mean\"; or, as it is more\r\nbroadly stated a few lines further on, \"This is an art which does mend\r\nNature, change it rather, but the art itself is Nature.\" I consider\r\nthese very remarkable statements when we reflect on the time in which\r\nthey were written. Darwin, in 1860, does but unfold the thought. The\r\nselection which Shakespeare notes as practiced by gardeners, and a\r\nsimilar selection seen in the world of domestic animals, gave Darwin\r\nhis cue of natural selection. The beauty of Darwin's thesis lies in\r\nthe fact that the process is natural, and such is Shakespeare's\r\ndictum. Later on, lines 112-128, Perdita brings out another remarkable\r\nobservation that has only lately been confirmed by the conclusions of\r\nscience:\r\n\r\n      \"... Now my fairest friend,\r\n      I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might\r\n      Become your time of day; and yours; and yours;\r\n      That wear upon your virgin branches yet\r\n      Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,\r\n      For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall\r\n      From Dis's wagon! daffodils,\r\n      That come before the swallow dares, and take\r\n      The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\r\n      But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\r\n      Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,\r\n      That die unmarried, ere they can behold\r\n      Bright Phoebus in his strength--a malady\r\n      Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and\r\n      The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds;\r\n      The flower-de-luce being one!\"\r\n\r\nPrimroses are dimorphic--i. e., on the same species we find flowers of\r\ndifferent sorts. These are complete, but in any particular flower the\r\nessential organs fail of adaptation to each other--the style in one\r\ntoo long, in another too short, to receive pollen from the stamens of\r\nits own flower. For fertilization such flowers are absolutely\r\ndependent upon the assistance brought by insect visitors. Perdita's\r\nprimrose is _Primula veris_, the early primrose, \"that takes the\r\nwinds of March with beauty,\" and dies ere it beholds \"bright Phoebus\r\nin his strength,\" and it is precisely this species that forms the\r\nbasis of one of Darwin's earliest and most fruitful studies in the\r\ncross-fertilization of flowers. The styles in one form of the early\r\nprimrose are three times as long as in the other, the stigmas differ,\r\nand the coadaptation of the parts of the different flowers extends\r\neven to the grains of pollen. Such flowers in the absence of insects\r\nare entirely unproductive. Insects are rare so early in the year, and\r\naccordingly many of the primroses die, as Perdita says, \"unmarried.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, it is not pretended that Shakespeare knew anything of this;\r\nbut that he should have discovered the fact that the early primrose\r\nbears little or no seed, and that he should have been impressed by the\r\ntruth that this is due to lack of fertilization, is wonderful. This\r\ncircumstance might well lead to the suspicion that the poet was a\r\ngardener.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget to notice, too, in this connection, that\r\ncarnations--i. e., pinks--are remarkable for the great number of their\r\nvarieties. We have, if I may so say, pinks of every color, from\r\ncrimson to white, even brown it is said. This was true in\r\nShakespeare's time, if one may trust Gerarde again; he says, \"A great\r\nand large volume would not suffice to write of every one at large\r\nconsidering how infinite they are, and how every year the climate and\r\ncountry bringeth forth new sorts and such as have not heretofore been\r\nwritten of.\"\r\n\r\nAnother passage in which the poet has instinctively hit upon a\r\nscientific truth is found in Sonnet IV, the last ten lines. The beauty\r\nof the passage as a whole is so remarkable that the delicate touches\r\nin particular lines are apt to be overlooked:\r\n\r\n      \"For never-resting time leads summer on\r\n      To hideous winter and confounds him there;\r\n      Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\r\n      Beauty o'ersnowed and bareness everywhere:\r\n      Then, were not summer's distillation left,\r\n      A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass.\r\n      Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\r\n        Nor it nor remembrance what it was:\r\n      But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,\r\n        Lose but their show; their substance still lives sweet.\"\r\n\r\nNo botanist can read the line \"A liquid prisoner pent in walls of\r\nglass\" and not recognize the exact portrayal of the living vegetable\r\ncell. The living protoplasm is a liquid prisoner sure enough, hemmed\r\nin by walls transparent. There could be no more striking image. And\r\nwhen in herb and tree, in every living plant, the summer's work is\r\nended and hideous winter falls, the new cells, summer's distillation\r\nleft, do in all perennials actually survive, lest of the effect of\r\nbeauty, beauty be bereft. There is no more marvelous picture in all\r\nthe vegetal world than that of a great tree with all its myriad cells,\r\nin summer so filled with the rush of life's activity and change that\r\nwe might hear its music, in autumn sinking to quiescence, and the\r\nwinter's silent chill where liquid prisoners sleep 'neath walls of\r\nglass. The poet did not understand it; he simply prophesied better\r\nthan he knew. He makes us think of Goethe, of Lucretius. These men\r\nmade happy guesses. Lucretius especially surprises us by his views of\r\nthe constitution of matter--unverified, so far as we can know. Goethe\r\nlived in the age of science and went on laboriously to verify his\r\nsurmises. The only natural science which Shakespeare knew was\r\ngardening--if that may be called a science. His Sonnets are supposed\r\nto have been written about 1590, and the first scientific glimpse of\r\nthe \"prisoner pent in walls of glass\" came about 1670, through the\r\nlenses of Nehemiah Grew, a Puritan physicist and botanist.\r\n\r\nI am aware that it is said by some that in a critique like this we are\r\napt to read much into the writings of our author. The quotations I\r\nhave submitted show, it seems to me, that this is unnecessary in the\r\npresent case at least. The words are generally unequivocal. Of course,\r\nthe language is poetical, metaphoric, but the metaphor has reference\r\nto something else; the description is not the metaphor. But, in fact,\r\nought we to expect in Shakespeare very exact or complete description?\r\nHis whole art lies in the power of suggestion. The deep impressions a\r\nman of genius makes upon our minds lie often, if not always, in what\r\nhe does not say. A word or two and the vision rises, whether in Nature\r\nor in life, a passion or a landscape. Take the broken phrases of\r\nOphelia depicting her broken heart, her \"no more but so\"; or the\r\npicture of the winter woods in Sonnet LXXIII:\r\n\r\n      \"That time of year thou mayst in me behold\r\n        When yellow leaves or none or few do hang\r\n      Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,\r\n        Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.\"\r\n\r\nDoes any one pretend that we are reading into the lines when we\r\nappreciate the marvelous sorrow of the one picture or the exquisite\r\ntruthfulness and splendor of the other?\r\n\r\nShakespeare's natural eye was clear indeed, but none the less he seems\r\nto have seen everything with the eye of his mind. Faraday so saw the\r\nworld of force, Newton of mathematical law, and Tyndall's scientific\r\nuse of the imagination lies in the same direction.\r\n\r\nAnd so the man of science and the poet have much in common. Both use\r\nthe natural world, and the imagination is for each an instrument of\r\neffort. The poet's generalization is a splendid vision in a world\r\nideal, suggested, no doubt, by what is actual and liable here and\r\nthere to coincide with truth; the generalization of the scientific man\r\nis likewise a vision, but it rests upon the actual, upon the\r\nascertained fact at the greatest number of points possible, and\r\ndisappoints us only that it is not everywhere coincident. The poet\r\ndreams of Atlantis, the lost continents, the islands of the blest, and\r\nbuilds us pictures that vanish with his song; the man of science too\r\nbeholds the continents rise; scene after scene he likewise makes to\r\npass across our startled vision; but his are history, his tapestries\r\nare wrought in the loom of time.\r\n\r\nThe poet writes the book of Genesis, with the herbs bringing forth\r\nfruit after their kind; the man of science figures fossil leaves and\r\ncones and fruit. Only at the last do poetry and science possibly again\r\nagree:\r\n\r\n      \"The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\r\n      The solemn temples, the great globe itself--\r\n      Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve,\r\n      And like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind!\"\r\n\r\nAnd when the man of science gathers all his data, and collates fact\r\nwith fact, and builds the superstructure of his vision, with him, too,\r\nall things fade and vanish in the infinity of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN INDUSTRIAL EXPOSITIONS--THEIR PURPOSES AND BENEFITS.\r\n\r\nBY MARCUS BENJAMIN, PH. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustrial expositions are a natural development of the fairs of the\r\nmiddle ages. The latter are believed to have originated in the\r\nreligious gatherings which afforded an opportunity for the sale of\r\nwares to large numbers of people. Such fairs still persist in northern\r\nEurope, and the best known of them is probably that held three times a\r\nyear in Leipsic, to which, it is said, \"some twenty-five or thirty\r\nthousand foreign merchants\" are still attracted each year.\r\n\r\nIn course of time international exhibitions at which specimens of the\r\narts and industries of the great nations of the world were contrasted\r\ncame into vogue. These began with the International Exhibition held in\r\nLondon in 1851, and of them three have been held in the United States,\r\nas follows: The first in New York, in 1853; the second in\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1876; and the third in Chicago, in 1893. The great\r\nmagnitude of such expositions has led in recent years to their\r\nspecialization or subdivision into expositions at which only a\r\nspecialty was presented. Notable among such have been the following,\r\nwhich were for the most part international: Of articles connected\r\nwith the leather industry, held in Berlin, in 1877; of all kinds of\r\npaper and pasteboard, held in Berlin, in 1878; of fisheries, held in\r\nBerlin, in 1880; of electricity, held in Paris, in 1881; of geography,\r\nheld in Venice, in 1881; of cotton, held in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1881;\r\nof early data in American history, held in Madrid, in 1881; of\r\nfisheries, held in London, in 1883; of historical matters pertaining\r\nto Columbus and the discovery of America, held in Madrid, in 1892; and\r\nof hygiene, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and sanitary objects,\r\nheld in Naples, in 1894.\r\n\r\nSimilarly there has been a development in the United States from local\r\nfairs, such as those of the various mechanics' institutes, typical of\r\nwhich is the one held annually since 1828 in New York city under the\r\nauspices of the American Institute, into interstate expositions. Of\r\nthese, since 1880, the following have been held: Cincinnati Industrial\r\nExposition, Cincinnati, Ohio, September 30 to October 4, 1883;\r\nSouthern Exposition, Louisville, Kentucky, August 16 to October 25,\r\n1883; World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition, New\r\nOrleans, Louisiana, December 16, 1883, to June 30, 1884; Central\r\nExposition of the Ohio Valley and Central States, Cincinnati, Ohio,\r\nJuly 4 to October 7, 1888; California Midwinter Fair, San Francisco,\r\nCalifornia, January 1 to July 4, 1894; Cotton States and Industrial\r\nExposition, Atlanta, Georgia, September 18 to December 31, 1895;\r\nTennessee Centennial Exposition, Nashville, Tennessee, May 1 to\r\nOctober 31, 1897; and Trans-Mississippi International Exposition,\r\nOmaha, Nebraska, June 1 to November 1, 1898.\r\n\r\nOf the foregoing, the more important were those held in New Orleans,\r\nin 1884; in San Francisco, in 1894; in Atlanta, in 1895; in Nashville,\r\nin 1897, and in Omaha, in 1898; especially so from the fact that all\r\nof these received recognition by the Government; and, with the\r\nexception of that held in San Francisco, liberal appropriations were\r\nmade for their support by Congress. Moreover, at each of them,\r\nexcepting again that held in San Francisco, a special Government\r\nbuilding was erected in which the national Government made exhibits of\r\nthe workings of the several executive departments, together with the\r\nSmithsonian Institution and its dependencies and the Fish Commission.\r\n\r\nThe first named, that of New Orleans, was held as a celebration of the\r\ncentenary of the cotton industry in the United States. The first\r\nrecord of cotton as a factor in the foreign trade of this country\r\nappeared in the shipment in 1784 of six bags, amounting to about one\r\nbale, from Charleston, South Carolina. Audubon Park was the site on\r\nwhich the buildings were erected.\r\n\r\nThe exposition held in San Francisco, in 1894, had for its purpose\r\nthe affording of an opportunity to foreign exhibitors at the World's\r\nFair to further display their goods in the United States, and in\r\nconsequence a great number of exhibits were shipped direct from\r\nChicago to the Pacific coast. The exposition was located in Golden\r\nGate Park.\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta Exposition had its inception in a belief that the\r\nagricultural, mineral, and manufacturing resources of the South were\r\nnot adequately represented in Chicago in 1893. It was believed that a\r\nbetter exhibit of the products of the Southland would tend to foster\r\ngreater trade relations between that section of our country and other\r\nparts of the United States, as well as with foreign countries,\r\nespecially those to the south, such as Mexico. The Cotton States\r\nExposition was held in Piedmont Park.\r\n\r\nThe exposition in Nashville was designed primarily to celebrate the\r\none hundredth anniversary of the admission of Tennessee into the\r\nFederal Union. Recognizing the commercial and educational advantages\r\nto be derived from such a demonstration, it was deemed wise to\r\ncharacterize the celebration as an exhibit of \"the matchless resources\r\nof Tennessee, and at the same time to lead to their greater\r\ndevelopment.\" The old West Side Park was chosen as the site of the\r\n\"Centennial City.\"\r\n\r\nThe exposition held last year in Omaha had for its purposes to do for\r\nthe Trans-Mississippi States what the more local exhibitions had done\r\nfor Atlanta and Nashville. It was claimed that it would for the \"first\r\ntime fully illustrate the wealth-producing power and the extent of\r\nproductive industries of the Greater West,\" and it did. The exposition\r\ngrounds were included within what was called the Kountze tract and the\r\nold fair grounds.\r\n\r\nEach of these expositions has been projected for distinct commercial\r\nreasons. They have had for their immediate purposes the presentation\r\nof the products of the region in which they were located to their\r\nneighbors, to the nation, and to the world. In this sense they have\r\nbeen simply the offspring of the fairs of the middle ages, differing\r\nfrom them only in that the feature of sale has been largely\r\neliminated. That they have been successful in accomplishing the\r\nresults desired is beyond doubt; indeed, the expositions in Nashville\r\nand Omaha were even financial successes. But they have done more than\r\nthis; they have accomplished a world of good in the way of education.\r\n\r\nLet us consider some of these benefits. Beginning with the grounds,\r\nthese have been given over to the charge of some competent landscape\r\narchitect under whose skillful supervision the desert has been made to\r\nblossom like a rose. The sand hills of San Francisco became the\r\nbeautiful \"Palm City,\" which since the close of the exposition has\r\nbecome one of the most attractive spots in the Golden Gate Park. At\r\nNashville the landscape effects were claimed by many to excel in\r\nbeauty those of the World's Fair in Chicago. \"Evergreens, vines, and\r\nshrubs are everywhere, and three lakes break this vista of green,\" was\r\nthe opinion of one visitor. Besides the general architectural effect\r\nof the buildings, which can not but impress those who are so fortunate\r\nas to visit these expositions, there is a special value in the\r\nreproductions of historical buildings. At Atlanta the Massachusetts\r\nBuilding was a representation of the Craigie House, the headquarters\r\nof Washington when in Cambridge at the beginning of the Revolution,\r\nand later the home of the poet Longfellow. It was a fortunate\r\ninspiration of the late Dr. G. Brown Goode that led to its\r\npresentation by the State of Massachusetts to the local Society of the\r\nDaughters of the American Revolution. The architectural feature of the\r\nNashville Exposition was the replica of the Athenian Parthenon in all\r\nits artistic beauty. Every detail was true to the original in design\r\nand coloring. It was the chief glory of the centennial, and as it was\r\na permanent structure it will long remain to the \"Athens of the South\"\r\na memorial of its exposition. Of less conspicuous interest were the\r\nreproductions of the Rialto of Venice and the Alamo of San Antonio.\r\n\r\nThe only architectural feature of historic character announced for\r\nOmaha was that \"the Arkansas Building will be a reproduction of the\r\nmansion of General Albert Pike in 1843.\" The long oval waterway around\r\nwhich the buildings were grouped afforded, however, excellent\r\nopportunity for studying the architecture of the buildings,\r\nwhich, it was claimed with much justice, approached those of the\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten \"White City\" in their beauty of design.\r\n\r\nFrom the exterior to the interior is a natural method of progression.\r\nLet us therefore pass to a brief consideration of the educational\r\nfeatures that are to be derived from an examination, no matter how\r\ncursory, of the displays that are to be seen within the buildings.\r\nFirst of all, and indeed frequently the most important, is the exhibit\r\nmade by the national Government. In the special building devoted to\r\nthat purpose are shown the exhibits of the several executive\r\ndepartments, including also that of the Smithsonian Institution and\r\nits dependencies, and the Fish Commission. As a result of the years of\r\naccumulated experience there has been in each of the expositions\r\npreviously mentioned, except that in San Francisco, a distinct\r\nimprovement in the installation of the exhibits in the Government\r\nBuilding, until it was recognized in Atlanta that the display was\r\nsuperior to that in Chicago, and in Nashville \"the best exhibit ever\r\nmade\" was the verdict of those who had seen the successive expositions\r\nprevious to that in Omaha. Therefore the telling of a story by means\r\nof objects in the best manner possible is the result sought for and\r\nattained most perfectly by those who installed the Government\r\nexhibits.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, understood that the purpose of the Government\r\nexhibit is to familiarize the public with the methods of carrying on\r\nthe functions of the different departments. Thus, in the post-office\r\nexhibit there is shown the entire sequence of postage stamps, both of\r\nthe United States and foreign countries, the various kinds of mail\r\nbags, figures of the mail carriers in their different uniforms, and\r\nfinally models or pictures of the methods of transportation. The\r\nTreasury Department shows the working of the mint by the striking of\r\ncommemorative medals, while a full series of the existing medals and\r\ncoins of the country are displayed in cases on the wall. The functions\r\nof the Department of the Interior are shown by exhibits of a series of\r\nmodels of some important invention, as, for instance, a sequence\r\nshowing the development of the sewing machine. In this way--for of\r\ncourse the blanks and other documents are shown--the working of the\r\nPatent Office is demonstrated; while the Geological Survey, also of\r\nthe Department of the Interior, presents a series of minerals, showing\r\nthe economical wealth of the country, together with its maps and\r\nreports, results of work accomplished. Everything can not be shown,\r\nbut a most excellent idea of what each department does can be had from\r\na study of the exhibits of the Government.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the Government Building is the one devoted to\r\ncommerce, and here are usually to be found the weak points of our\r\nAmerican expositions. In lieu of a series of exhibits showing the\r\nprogress in a given industry or trade, we find too frequently a\r\ncollection of nondescript articles without much if any relationship to\r\neach other. This is due primarily to a lack of proper organization in\r\nsoliciting exhibits, and also because the awards or medals of the\r\njurors are so often of no relative value. The second condition is an\r\noutcome of the first. To be more specific, in Nashville there were no\r\nexhibits from any one of the larger and well-known silver firms, and\r\nyet American silverware has a recognized status as one of the most\r\nsuccessful of our American art industries. Cut glassware is another\r\nbranch in which our artisans or art workmen have achieved splendid\r\nresults, and still there were no exhibits from art glassmakers in\r\nNashville. Certain varieties of art pottery and art glassware, such as\r\nthe Rookwood pottery and the Tiffany glass, are seldom seen at these\r\nsmaller expositions. In consequence the juror makes an award to the\r\nbest article of its kind on exhibition, which may be but a third-rate\r\narticle compared with others; still it is the best shown in the\r\nexposition, and therefore worthy of recognition. Another unfortunate\r\nfeature must be mentioned at this point. It is the decorative\r\nfeature. At the last World's Fair held in Paris there was a colossal\r\nfigure of George Washington in chocolate exhibited by an American\r\nmanufacturer of that article. While it might be considered as a\r\nlaudable attempt to make known to the French nation the features of\r\nthe \"Father of his Country,\" and from that point of view worthy of\r\nrecognition, still it was no evidence of the superiority of the\r\nchocolate, and therefore could not be considered in connection with\r\nthe giving of an award. This condition of affairs prevails at every\r\nexposition, and too frequently an exhibit of a meritorious article is\r\nmade in such a modest manner that its claims are overshadowed by the\r\npretentious display of something quite inferior.\r\n\r\nTwo conditions thus present themselves--namely, the lack of proper\r\nexhibits and the improper presentation of certain exhibits. The first\r\ncondition may be overcome by a more perfect canvass of the industries\r\nof the country. In nearly every one of these there is a national\r\norganization, and it should be the duty of that body to consider the\r\nmatter. By the appointment of committees and working among the\r\nrepresentatives of the industry, either a good exhibit from the\r\nleading firms could be secured, or else a collective exhibit of the\r\nbest from many firms could be obtained. Typical of the last named was\r\nthe exhibit made by the potters of the country at the World's Fair in\r\nChicago. By the adoption of such a method of displaying the products\r\nof manufacturers the possibility of the second condition would be\r\nentirely eliminated.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the value of these expositions is chiefly educational, and\r\nsurely no more perfect way of educating the visitor or sightseer could\r\nbe found than by placing before him a historical series of products,\r\nbeginning with the one made first in point of time, continuing with\r\nbetter specimens, showing the improvements that have resulted from\r\nincreased experience and knowledge, and culminating with the finest\r\nproduct now made. The contrast between the first and the last would be\r\nindeed most striking.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought from the foregoing remarks that these\r\ninterstate expositions have been lacking in the presentation of the\r\nproducts of their own home industries. Far from it. In San Francisco,\r\nin Atlanta, in Nashville, and in Omaha the local manufacturers did\r\nthemselves great credit by the admirable way in which their goods were\r\nshown, but it was just in this particular feature that the weak point\r\nindicated previously made itself most conspicuous. A local silversmith\r\ncould hardly be expected to compete with the more famous manufacturers\r\nin the same line in larger cities, and yet in the absence of an\r\nexhibit by the better known firm an award would naturally be given to\r\nthe smaller manufacturer, thus creating a false impression to the\r\nworld at large.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that the educational value of the exhibits in\r\nthe Commerce Building is without commendation. Next to making a thing,\r\nthe seeing of it is most important, and surely no one can pass along\r\nthe aisles of any exposition without noticing much that is new or\r\nunusual, no matter what his previous experience may have been. It is\r\nin this connection that the foreign section is frequently most\r\ninstructive. Warm furs from Russia and the north, rich fabrics and\r\nstrange metal ware from the Orient, rare porcelains from Copenhagen,\r\nand brilliant glassware from Bohemia and Hungary, tell the story with\r\nstriking vividness of the special products of the Old-World nations.\r\n\r\nAs has been shown, the finished products of manufacturers are those\r\nthat are housed in the building devoted to commerce and manufacturing,\r\nbut the raw materials require a building or two for themselves. That\r\nin which the products of the earth are exhibited is usually designated\r\nthe \"Minerals and Forestry Building.\" This requires but brief mention,\r\nand has its chief interest for the expert. Geological specimens,\r\nincluding paleontological and lithological exhibits, show the age and\r\ncharacter of the soil, while the rocks further indicate the\r\npossibilities of the territory, for they show the geological horizon.\r\nIn natural order are shown the minerals of the country. At Atlanta and\r\nNashville the richness of the mineral wealth of the Southern States\r\nwas fully demonstrated. Not only ores such as those of iron and\r\nmanganese, but the combustible minerals, as coal, lignite, and\r\npetroleum, were exhibited. More striking, perhaps, are the great\r\nnumbers of economic minerals that these expositions show. The\r\nmaterials--phosphate rock, sulphur, and nitrates--used in making\r\nartificial fertilizers; the marbles; the pigment-yielding minerals,\r\nincluding ochres, umber, and barite; the clays, with their products of\r\nearthenware and pottery, bricks, and tiles; and even mineral waters\r\nare among the different minerals to be seen. It is from such exhibits\r\nthat something of an idea is obtained of the enormous wealth that is\r\ncontained in the earth, waiting only to be excavated and fashioned\r\ninto articles of beauty and utility. While such exhibits are\r\nfrequently to be seen in museums, still the average mind is more\r\nimpressed by the casual examination of these things in expositions,\r\nand one's pride of home increased by the rich stores of mineral wealth\r\nattractively installed. It is customary also to show models of the\r\nmachinery used in mining, and even books, maps, and drawings are not\r\nuncommonly seen.\r\n\r\nA similar arrangement is followed in regard to the forest products.\r\nLogs and sections of trees, as well as samples of wood and timber of\r\nall kinds, are shown. Then come the finished products--boards,\r\nshingle, and moldings--and finally the manufactured articles, such as\r\npails, tubs, and then furniture. Barks, as for tanning or dyeing,\r\nseeds and gums, and the wood pulp for paper are on exhibition. Among\r\nthe miscellaneous products deserving mention are fibers, as used in\r\nbasket-making or cane work.\r\n\r\nForestry as a science is made the basis of a series of exhibits. These\r\ninclude timber culture, tools used, and methods employed in planting\r\nand caring for trees. And finally lumbering as a science finds a place\r\nin the scheme followed in this department. This includes the tools\r\nused in lumbering and the methods employed, as well as exhibits\r\nillustrating the tan-bark industry, the turpentine industry, and the\r\ncharcoal industry. So it happens that there is much that can be\r\nlearned by the student who will devote a little time to the analysis\r\nof the exhibits in the building devoted to the products of the mines\r\nand the forest.\r\n\r\nA visit to the Agricultural Building reveals to the interested\r\nobserver those products of the soil that are for the most part the\r\nresult of cultivation, and so we find exhibits of cereals--wheat,\r\noats, barley, and the like--and then their immediate products: bread,\r\npastes such as macaroni, and starches. The sugar-yielding plants,\r\ntogether with honey and the manufactured product, as candy and other\r\nconfections, come next in order. The root crops, such as potatoes or\r\nbeets, and the vegetables, are of much importance. Preserved meats and\r\nfood preparations, dairy products, spices, tea, and tobacco are among\r\nthe articles on exhibition. Then come the plants yielding fibers, as\r\ncotton and the like; but we hasten on to make mention of the exhibits\r\nof implements used in agriculture and its special subdivisions, such\r\nas horticulture, viticulture, floriculture, and arboriculture. Who\r\nwill gainsay the fact that the farmer can not do otherwise than learn\r\nmuch from a visit to the home of the products of the soil? It it also\r\ncustomary to include a live-stock exhibition during some period of the\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the building devoted to the finished products\r\nof manufactures and of the buildings in which the crude materials are\r\ndisplayed. Besides these there are usually several buildings devoted\r\nto the exhibition of the means by which the original substances,\r\nwhether from the mine, forest, or farm, are made up into the\r\ncommercial product for the merchant. One of these is called the\r\n\"Transportation Building,\" and in it we find the various means by\r\nwhich the raw materials are conveyed to the factory. From the lower\r\nforms of transportation of which man is the motive power, such as the\r\nwheelbarrow, upward through the various forms of vehicles of which the\r\npower comes from horses and other animals, until as the topmost member\r\nof the series is shown the magnificently equipped train of railway\r\ncars, provided with all the conveniences that modern luxury can\r\ndevise. If the visitor is not content with land locomotion, more than\r\nlikely he can find an exhibit in which transportation on water is\r\npossible, as by means of a naphtha or steam launch.\r\n\r\nMachinery is the active means by which the immediate transposition of\r\nthe crude material into the finished article is accomplished. And in a\r\nbuilding where the ceaseless belt moves with the rapidly revolving\r\npulley may be seen the many forms of machinery which the active brain\r\nof the ingenious mechanic has devised to cheapen labor and increase\r\nproduction. The change of the cotton fiber into cloth, or the passage\r\nof the silken thread into the finished handkerchief; the revolving\r\ncylinder on which the virgin sheet of white paper becomes the printed\r\npurveyor of news; or the many and varied appliances by which the piece\r\nof leather is fashioned into a covering for the foot; or again the\r\nmeans by which the strip of steel is made into a pin or needle, are\r\namong the interesting things that may be seen in Machinery Hall.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the many interesting wonders of science that were\r\nshown at the Centennial, in 1876, were the few, insignificant, blue,\r\nflickering, and unstable lights that ushered into existence a new era\r\nin the history of electricity. In Atlanta, in Nashville, and in Omaha\r\na building was necessary to hold the appliances and products of the\r\nlatest of our sciences. Telephones no longer impress us by their\r\nnewness, and the appliances of electricity to heating and lighting are\r\nnow household necessities. To those who treasured the memory of the\r\nbeauty of the lighted Court of Honor at the White City in Chicago\r\nthere was given a greater joy when the entire grounds of the beautiful\r\nCentennial City in Nashville were illuminated with more than seventeen\r\nthousand incandescent lamps. Daylight had faded into darkness only to\r\nemerge into an electric day of brilliancy unsurpassed. Thus was told\r\nthe story of the progress of the science which as a result of the\r\nstudies of Franklin, Henry, Morse, and Graham Bell may well be\r\nregarded as the American science.\r\n\r\nA parting word must be given to the amusement features. How the\r\nStreets of Cairo, now so hackneyed, linger in one's memory! The\r\nEnchanted Swing was one of the novel features of the Midwinter Fair in\r\nSan Francisco, and of weird interest was the Night and Morning in\r\nNashville. The Mexican and Japanese villages were excellent features\r\nin Atlanta, and so was the Chinese village in Nashville, although the\r\n\"Old Plantation\" was more popular. Panoramas such as that of the\r\nBattle of Gettysburg, or pyrotechnic spectacular shows such as The\r\nStorming of Wei-Hai-Wei, are of value. The musical features must not\r\nbe forgotten, even if popular fancy leans toward Dixie, for the\r\noccasional \"Gems from the Operas\" help to leaven the mass. At\r\nNashville the military drills by the national and State troops were\r\nof considerable interest, and much had been hoped for in Omaha in this\r\nrespect, but the war prevented.\r\n\r\nIn this analysis, incomplete, it is true, of these American interstate\r\nexpositions something has been shown of their design and more of their\r\nbenefits. They have had for their purpose the exhibition of the\r\nmaterials, processes, and products of manufacture, but their ultimate\r\nbenefit has been that of education. To the thoughtful an opportunity\r\nhas been afforded of following the crude material through the\r\nprocesses of manufacture until the finished product has been\r\nexhibited. The variety of crude materials was shown him, the different\r\nprocesses were contrasted, and finally the completed article was\r\nexhibited which possessed this merit or that advantage according to\r\nthe process followed. For the mere pleasure-seeker there were the\r\ndelights of attractive surroundings, the beauty of the exhibits, and\r\nthe delights of music or other entertainments. Indeed, all the\r\ninfluences are for good.\r\n\r\nLet it then be the effort of every one, whether official, exhibitor,\r\nor visitor, to use his influence to improve and elevate these\r\nexpositions so that only the most desirable localities shall be chosen\r\nin which to hold them, and let the selection of exhibits be made so as\r\nto include the most worthy; for then, and only then, will the visitor\r\nderive the greatest benefit.\r\n\r\nAnd so from time to time and in various places we shall have these\r\ninterstate expositions, which will show to the world the advancement\r\nmade in the development of the resources of our great country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKWORMS IN FACT AND FANCY.\r\n\r\nBY WILLARD AUSTEN.\r\n\r\n      \"What is a bookworm? Tell me if you can;\r\n      I merely mean the insect, not the man--\r\n      A reptile whom a wit like Hood might dub\r\n      A grub that grubs in Grub Street for its grub.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    ROBERT ROCKLIFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much mystery has gathered around the term bookworm, so much imagery\r\nhas been employed in depicting the appearance and devastations of this\r\nmythical creature, that many have been prepared to accept almost\r\nanything, no matter how fabulous, that might be said about this\r\nunknown enemy of literature. Reaction against these weird and\r\nfantastical accounts is indicated by the question, not infrequently\r\nasked, \"Are there such things as bookworms?\" Few are aware that in\r\nthis creature we encounter another case of masquerading, that these\r\n\"destroyers of the Muses\" are common enough pests playing other rôles\r\nthan those in which they are familiarly known. Some of them are met\r\nwith daily in the house and elsewhere, and arouse no unusual interest,\r\nwhile the world goes on wondering what a bookworm is like.\r\n\r\nInsects injurious to books and bindings are not a new subject. The\r\nGreeks and Romans observed and wrote about them, but notwithstanding,\r\ntheir knowledge of zoölogy, comparatively speaking, was so meager,\r\nthey do not seem to have felt any of the mystery or wonderment about\r\nthese creatures which we have felt. The terms _blatta_, _tinea_,\r\n_silphe_, are frequently met with in the works of classical writers,\r\nand, while we can not be sure of the particular species they intended\r\nto allude to by these terms, we do in many instances know from the\r\ncontext that the creatures known to them had like characteristics with\r\nthose known to us, and that they were given to literary depredations\r\nas are their descendants.\r\n\r\nThe earliest allusion to a book-destroying worm which has come down to\r\nus from classical lore was rescued from oblivion by the lad Salmasius\r\nin 1606, when he discovered the manuscripts of the anthology of\r\nCephalas in the library of the Counts Palatine at Heidelberg. Among\r\nthe fragments in this collection is one attributed to Evenus, the\r\nsophist-poet of Paros, who wrote about 450 B. C., in which the \"foul\r\ndestroyer\" is thus berated:\r\n\r\n      \"O worst enemy of the Muses, devourer of the pages of books,\r\n      Foul destroyer that lurkest in a hole, ever feeding on what thou\r\n        hadst stolen from learning,\r\n      Tell me, black-colored bookworm, why dost thou lie in ambush to\r\n        injure the sacred decrees while fashioning thy envious image?\"\r\n\r\nAristotle, in his History of Animals, mentioned the \"little\r\nscorpionlike creature found in books\"; a characterization which\r\nobtains to-day for the little creature which Leunis calls the\r\n\"_Bücherscorpion_.\" Horace addresses his finished book, to which he\r\nimputes an unbecoming haste to be displayed on the booksellers'\r\nstalls, thus: \"When thumbed by the hands of the vulgar, you begin to\r\ngrow dirty, then you will in silence feed the groveling bookworm.\"\r\nOvid, in his exile at Tomi, likens the \"external remorse of its cares\"\r\nwhich his heart feels to the gnawing of the _tinea_.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fact that Pliny is said to have comprised in his\r\nNatural History all the knowledge of the natural sciences then known,\r\nit is a little surprising that he had not more to say regarding book\r\ninsects. Here and there in his writings, however, he speaks of worms\r\nin connection with books and papers in the same casual way as other\r\nclassical writers, causing you to feel that he was conversant with\r\ntheir destructive tendencies. The epigrammatist Martial in the first\r\ncentury, and Lucian in the second, both use the term bookworm;\r\nMartial, in much the same way as did Horace, warning his book of the\r\nfate awaiting it; Lucian, in his well-known dialogue, The Dream; or,\r\nThe Cock, as a symbol of the condition to which miserly man may\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\nSufficient has been said to show the attitude of the ancients toward\r\nthese little pests, that had no more regard for their precious\r\nthoughts than for the utterances of modern \"statesmen,\" whose speeches\r\nare \"read by title and ordered printed.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing the cloistered period of the ages called dark, when books\r\nwere so few and so constantly used by the jolly monks that these\r\nlittle creatures must have had a difficult time getting a living\r\nunobserved, we come down to the sixteenth century, by which time books\r\nhad begun to multiply and worms to propagate. In the last quarter of\r\nthis century we find Pierre Petit, who is numbered among the\r\ncelebrated pleiade of Latin verse writers along with Rapin,\r\nCommire, and others, addressing these \"impudent creatures\" in a\r\nthirty-four-line Latin poem titled In Blattam.\r\n\r\nA curious and interesting characterization of some species of book\r\ninsects has come to us in the writings of Christian Mentzel, the\r\nGerman naturalist and philologist, who lived in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. When one reads that he heard the bookworm crow like a cock,\r\nand said, \"I knew not whether some local fowl was clamoring or whether\r\nthere was but a beating in my ears,\" one can not help wondering if\r\nthere was not something defective in his ear drums; but further on he\r\nsays, \"I perceived, in the paper whereon I was writing, a little\r\ninsect that ceased not to carol like very chanticleer, until taking a\r\nmagnifying glass I assiduously observed him.\" From this one concludes\r\nthat if the fault were not with his hearing, by which some well-known\r\nsounds made by book insects seemed to him like the crowing of a cock,\r\nan altogether different cock from the kind we know must have lived in\r\nhis day.\r\n\r\nThe earliest observations on the subject possessing any scientific\r\nvalue were made by Robert Hooke in his Micrographia, published in\r\nLondon in 1665. In many respects this work was a curious medley of\r\nfacts and fancy. The registers of the Royal Society, of which he was a\r\nmember, testify to the eagerness with which Hooke hurried from one\r\ninquiry to another with \"brilliant but inconclusive results.\" Among\r\nthe many objects which engaged his attention was an insect which he\r\ndescribed in a chapter entitled Of the Small Silver-colour'd Bookworm.\r\nHis description shows it to have been the \"fishtail,\" by naturalists\r\ncalled _Lepisma_, well known as one of the pests that not infrequently\r\nis found in the library as well as other parts of the house.\r\n\r\nMany interesting instances of the discovery of bookworms are found in\r\nthe literature on the subject, showing the keen interest felt in the\r\nsearch for specimens of the \"destroyer,\" many of them revealing the\r\nfact that some unique and curious creature which stands alone in its\r\ntaste for literary food was sought. Mr. Blades reported in 1858 that\r\nhe found specimens in some black-letter fragments at the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, that were recognized by the librarian, Dr. Bandinel, who\r\ncrushed them with his thumb, saying, as he wiped his thumb nail on his\r\ncoat sleeve, \"O yes, they have black heads sometimes.\" The librarian\r\nof Hereford Cathedral, the Rev. F. S. Havergal, contributes his\r\nobservations, covering a period of eighteen years, during which time\r\nhe reports that he found two distinct species. From his description,\r\nhowever, it appears that he failed to recognize that the two were the\r\nlarva and imago of the same species. Many cases of the finding of\r\nbookworms reported in England and America are not accompanied with\r\nsufficient data to determine just what they were. These contribute to\r\nthe general impression that many have sought but few have found what\r\nwere thought to be \"genuine bookworms,\" while on every hand are those\r\ncreatures which under the right conditions become book destroyers.\r\n\r\nResearch among the literature concerning library pests reveals the\r\nfact that no less than eleven different groups have members that are\r\ndirectly or indirectly accused of injuring books and bindings. The\r\nnumber of species in each group ranges from one to eleven, making a\r\ntotal of over thirty different species. In addition to these there are\r\nothers against which the evidence is at best only circumstantial. It\r\nis not necessary to say that none of these bear any resemblance in any\r\nperiod of their existence to worms, and that the term bookworms is a\r\nmisnomer. The word has become so firmly fixed in literature, both in\r\nits figurative and literal sense, that its misuse will no doubt\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nThe larger number of these are included in the class _Hexapoda_, or\r\ninsects. Two species belong to the class _Arachnida_, which embraces\r\nthe scorpions, spiders, mites, etc. One of these, _Chelifer\r\ncancroides_, known as the \"book scorpion,\" although not a true\r\nscorpion, belongs to the order _Pseudoscorpiones_, and is probably\r\nwhat Aristotle had in mind when speaking of the \"little scorpionlike\r\ninsects found in books.\" The other species is known as _Cheyletus\r\neruditus_, of the order _Acarina_, or \"cheese mites.\" These two are\r\nknown to be carnivorous in their habits, and there is some question as\r\nto whether they haunt books for the purpose of feeding on them or on\r\nother creatures to be found there.\r\n\r\nOf those in the class _Hexapoda_, which comprises all the other known\r\nbook pests, there can be no question as regards their destructiveness.\r\nMany are known about the house by the name of the article they are\r\nmost frequently found in, and unless driven by a lack of those things\r\nmore to their liking, they do not invade the literary sanctum. Some\r\nare so cosmopolitan in their tastes that they seem to take whatever is\r\nmost convenient, whether it be books or boots, pepper or poison.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, the earliest observation of value was made by Hooke\r\non _Lepisma_, commonly known as \"fish moth\" or \"silver fish,\" from its\r\nresemblance, in shape and coating, to a fish; also as \"bristle tail,\"\r\nfrom its caudal appendages. They are found in closets, cupboards, and\r\nclothes baskets. Opinions have differed as to its destructiveness to\r\nbooks, but the weight of evidence is against the insect. It seeks the\r\npaste and sizing used about books, and this leads it to attack\r\nbindings and labels. There is a theory that paste made from pure\r\nstarch is not to their liking, but this is not substantiated by\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nTermites or \"white ants,\" another misnomer, since they are not true\r\nants, are also well-known ravagers whose deeds of destruction assume a\r\nserious aspect, especially in the tropics. \"Humboldt,\" according to\r\nShimer, \"informs us that in all equinoctial America, where the white\r\nants abound, it is infinitely rare to find papers or books that go\r\nback fifty or sixty years.\" Their destruction to timber has been the\r\ncause of serious accidents, at one time so weakening the supports of a\r\ndwelling that a whole dinner party was precipitated from the third\r\nfloor to the basement. These pests belong to the order _Isoptera_. The\r\nAmerican species is known as _Termes flavipes_, and several\r\nwell-authenticated cases of their having done serious injury to books\r\nand bindings in this country are recorded. As the chief sustenance of\r\nthese insects seems to be dead wood, it may be that the increased use\r\nof wood in paper will make modern books, which bookworms are said to\r\nscorn, more tempting than ever to them.\r\n\r\nBy opening quickly some old book which has lain long unused, one may\r\nsee tiny pale creatures with knowing black eyes scurrying across the\r\npages. These insects are known as \"book lice,\" or by the Germans as\r\n\"_Staublaus_\" (dust louse). Entomologists have given them the\r\nhigh-sounding name _Atropos divinatoria_. They belong to the family\r\n_Psocidæ_, of the order _Corrodentia_. Some writers, beginning with\r\nWilliam Derham, in 1701, are of the opinion that this delicate little\r\ncreature makes a noise like unto that of the coleopterous insect\r\ncalled \"death-watch.\" These little fellows are said to have stout jaws\r\nwith which they do damage to books, dried plants, etc., \"nibbling away\r\nthe leaves and covers of the former.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the insects that injure books perhaps the best known are the\r\ncockroaches, scientifically called _Blattidæ_, of which there are five\r\nspecies whose bookish habits are unquestioned. Many instances of\r\nserious damage done by them to the bindings of books are on record,\r\nthe most important, perhaps, being that of the Natural History Museum\r\nReports, at Albany, where Mr. J. A. Lintner found a hundred volumes or\r\nmore so badly damaged by roaches that they could not be moved without\r\ncoming to pieces. The United States Senate Reports, bound in cloth and\r\nleather, some fresh and new, have been badly damaged at Washington, in\r\nthe efforts of these pests to get at the paste with which the covers\r\nwere fastened to the volumes. The species known to commit these\r\ndepredations are the \"Croton bug\" (_Blatta germanica_), smaller than\r\nthe others, but considered by some writers as the worst pests of the\r\nfamily; a little larger species, called _Periplaneta orientalis_; and\r\na large species, known as _Periplaneta americana_, or _Kakerlac_.\r\nAgainst two other species, _Blatta australasiæ_ and _Blatta gigantea_,\r\nthere is not so much evidence.\r\n\r\nAmong the moths, or millers, order _Lepidoptera_, are found several\r\nspecies which injure books, the best known being the _Aglossa\r\npinguinalis_, commonly called \"grease moth.\" The larva of this species\r\nis at first a pale, flesh-colored grub, but as it matures it becomes\r\nquite black. It injures bindings by constructing long \"silken tubes,\"\r\nin which it remains until full fed. Sometimes they spin a web between\r\nthe volumes, \"gnawing small portions of the paper with which to form\r\ntheir cocoons.\" This species belongs to the family _Pyralididæ_. Of\r\nthe family _Oecophoridæ_ two species are known to injure books:\r\n_Acompsia pseudospretella_, and an undetermined species of\r\n_Depressaria_. Under the name _Oecophora_, William Blades describes\r\nthe ravages of the former on two leaves of a \"Caxton,\" and accompanies\r\nhis remarks with a photographic illustration of the damaged leaves,\r\nfrom which it is at once seen how irregular is the gnawing of this\r\nspecies. The newspaper account of the finding of bookworms in the\r\nLenox Library not long ago classed the larvæ found with this species.\r\n\r\nThe largest number of book-destroying insects are found among the\r\nbeetles, of the order _Coleoptera_. To this group belong the \"book\r\nborers.\" The species thus far considered have been more or less\r\ndilettantes in literature. The beetles, however, seem possessed with a\r\ntrue spirit of investigation, and when they undertake a piece of work\r\nin a serious fashion they go to the bottom of it, sticking close to\r\nthe line laid down. This characteristic distinguishes these insects\r\nfrom all others, and makes it comparatively easy to determine when\r\nthey have been at work in a worm-eaten volume. No less than sixteen\r\ndifferent species of this order have been either detected in this\r\nwork, or such strong circumstantial evidence has been found against\r\nthem, that there is little doubt as to their guilt. Some insects seem\r\nto destroy books for the sheer want of something better to do; some do\r\nso in seeking the paste and sizing used in and about the books;\r\nothers because the leather bindings are desirable material in which\r\nto undergo transformation; and, again, others haunt book shelves and\r\nbooks in search of prey in the form of living creatures. But among the\r\nbeetles are found tiny little grubs that seem to have a genuine intent\r\nto destroy; that set out deliberately to wreak vengeance on man's\r\nrecord of his thoughts, deeds, and discoveries, and, as if knowing the\r\nmeans which man uses to destroy, have sought to imitate him in the\r\neffects produced. As a result we find books filled with small, round,\r\nshotlike holes strongly suggesting the results which might follow from\r\nthe use of the family Bible by the restless boy as a target for his\r\nfirst shotgun.\r\n\r\nThe book-destroying beetles are all grouped under three families:\r\n_Dermestidæ_, _Scolytidæ_, and _Ptinidæ_. The _Dermestidæ_ include the\r\n\"flower beetles\" and the well-known \"carpet bug.\" The species of which\r\nthere can be no doubt as to its disposition to pierce book bindings is\r\n_Anthrenus varius_, which Glover says \"is a very pretty insect when\r\nexamined under a magnifying glass, being beautifully marbled or\r\nvariegated with black and gray.\" Another member of this family,\r\nagainst which there is less evidence, is _Dermestes chinensis_, so\r\nnamed by Dr. L'Herminier, of Guadeloupe, who reported a loss of nearly\r\nfour hundred volumes from its ravages. Erichson believes this to have\r\nbeen the well-known _Anobium paniceum_. _Dermestes lardarius_ and\r\n_Attagenus pellio_ are others of this family mentioned in the same\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\nThe family _Ptinidæ_ includes two groups, _Anobium_ and _Ptinus_, the\r\nfirst being generally known as the \"death-watch,\" from the peculiar\r\nsound, like the tick of a watch, which is produced by striking against\r\na hard substance with their tiny jaws. Superstitious persons have long\r\nconsidered this noise an omen of death, hence the name. Instead of an\r\nill omen, this noise proves itself to be a love-call between the\r\nsexes, and may be imitated accurately enough to elicit a response. One\r\nof the best known of these beetles is called _Sitodrepa panicea_,\r\ngenerally known in Europe as _Anobium paniceum_. It is a cosmopolitan\r\nfeeder, having a reputation in several different fields of activity,\r\ncommercial and scientific as well as literary. To druggists it is\r\nknown as \"the worm,\" and their stock of ginger, rhubarb, Cayenne\r\npepper, nux vomica, and belladonna root all appear to be equally to\r\nits liking, tin foil being no formidable barrier to its persistent\r\nsearch. Leather dealers have suffered from the destruction wrought by\r\nthis little fellow to such an extent that whole cases of boots and\r\nshoes, carriage trimmings, etc., have been ruined. To this species\r\nbelongs the insect found a few years ago at work in a volume of\r\nDante's Divine Comedy, which had been sent to Cornell University\r\nlibrary from Florence. The larvæ are about three to four millimetres\r\nin length, of a dirty-white color, head tinged with brown, and black\r\nmouth parts, with the abdomen strongly curved. The adult is a small,\r\ncylindrical, brown beetle from two to three millimetres in length,\r\nwith head bent down and wing covers marked with fine punctate striæ.\r\n\r\nProfessor Poey made extensive observations of an insect in Cuba which\r\nhad destroyed about four thousand volumes. He called it _Anobium\r\nbibliothecarum_, and Schwartz thinks the injury reported by Herminier\r\nfrom Guadeloupe should be attributed to the same species. _Anobium\r\nstriatum_ and _pertinax_ have long been known to injure books by their\r\n\"gnawing and burrowing,\" not only in and through the bindings, but\r\nalso entirely through the volumes. _Nicobium hirtum_, a native of\r\nsouthern Europe, where its larvæ have been found doing like injury, is\r\nonly locally abundant, and for this reason has never been considered a\r\nserious library pest. Schwartz says, \"In one way or another the insect\r\nhas found its way to North America, but has always been regarded as a\r\ngreat rarity with us.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Ptinus_ group embraces _Ptinus fur_, _Ptinus mollis_, _Ptinus\r\nbrunneus_, and _Ptilinus pectinicornis_, called by Leunis\r\n\"_Bücherbohrer_.\" According to Butler, a peculiarity of this\r\ngenius--that of dissimilarity of shape between the sexes--is well\r\nillustrated by the _P. fur_, the male being almost cylindrical, the\r\nfemale inflated or rounded at the sides; so much variation that they\r\nmight be taken for two different insects. _Ptinus brunneus_, although\r\nsimilar to _P. fur_, is distinguished from it by being wholly of a\r\nlight-brown color and destitute of whitish bands on the wing covers.\r\nSome writers speak of this species as the \"book beetle,\" while\r\n_Sitodrepa_ is spoken of as the \"spice beetle.\" Dr. Henry Shimer makes\r\nthe following statement regarding their method of boring: \"They\r\nusually operate in leather-bound or half-bound volumes by boring\r\ngalleries along in the leather.... They usually bore along quite under\r\nthe surface of the leather, cutting it almost through; occasionally a\r\nsmall round hole penetrates through the leather to the outer surface.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous cases on record of insects boring through books\r\nis that reported by M. Peignot, in which he states that twenty-seven\r\nfolio volumes were pierced through in so straight a line that a cord\r\nmight be passed through them and all the volumes raised by means of\r\nit. Different writers give the credit of this feat to different\r\nmembers of this group, so that the most that can be said is that it\r\nwas the work of some member of the _Ptinidæ_.\r\n\r\nIn the family _Scolytidæ_ only one species belongs to the book\r\nravagers. It is known as _Hypothemus eruditus_, and was described by\r\nWestwood in 1836 as \"pitchy black, the head of the same color,\r\nentirely concealed from above by the front thorax.\" It is very minute\r\nin size, being about one twentieth of an inch in length. So far as\r\nits depredations have been observed it confines its work to the\r\nbindings of books, making furrows in all directions much as it does in\r\nthe sap wood of dead trees. The strong resemblance of its burrowing to\r\nthe gouging done by an engraver's chisel has given to this family the\r\nname of \"engraver beetles.\"\r\n\r\nA review of the different families of insects whose habits under\r\nfavorable conditions lead them to infest books and bindings will show\r\nthem to be more or less well defined according to their feeding\r\nhabits. The book scorpions and mite, _Cheyletus eruditus_, which, as\r\nwe have seen, do not come under the head of insects, are primarily\r\ncarnivorous, and their presence in books may be due to the fact that\r\nthey find there animal as well as vegetable food. This is certainly\r\ntrue of the book scorpion, which feeds on mites, book lice, and other\r\nsmall insects. The \"fish moths\" or \"silver fish,\" the \"book lice,\" and\r\nthe \"cockroaches\" can have no other reason for infesting books than\r\ntheir liking for farinaceous substances such as are used in and about\r\nthe bindings and labels of books. For this reason the damage done by\r\nthem is largely confined to the exterior or interior of the bindings,\r\nand only so much of the book itself is injured as comes in their way\r\nin their search for food. The \"white ants\" feed principally on wood,\r\nand in and about books there is more or less wood fiber which would be\r\nto the liking of these voracious feeders. The moths and beetles are\r\nthe burrowers and borers. They seek retired places in which to lay\r\ntheir eggs where the larvæ will be surrounded with food for their\r\ngrowth. The moths and some of the beetles are more given to burrowing\r\nin the bindings, keeping close to the outer surface for the purpose,\r\nit is thought, of making it easy for the imago to emerge after the\r\nchange is completed; while others bore straight tunnels often from\r\ncover to cover.\r\n\r\nA natural conclusion for one who has gone over the literature of\r\nbook-injuring pests to reach is that the many persons that have been\r\nindustriously looking for the bookworm, as well as those that have\r\nreported the finding of isolated specimens, some dead, some alive,\r\nhave had in mind the one creature which bored holes in books. The\r\nfrequent use of the terms \"genuine bookworm,\" \"the real bookworm,\"\r\netc., reveals the fact that the users of these phrases approached the\r\nsubject with a preconceived idea of the kind of creature they should\r\nfind to account for the ravages only too apparent on scores of volumes\r\nwhich pass through the hands of booksellers and book keepers. To many\r\nthe boring beetles are the only creatures which are rightfully called\r\nbookworms, and in their search other book pests have not been taken\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROPHOBIA IN BAJA CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nBY DANE COOLIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1884, Pasteur discovered the true nature and cure of\r\nhydrophobia, he dispelled the accumulated superstition of centuries\r\nregarding this mysterious and dreaded disease. But in some countries\r\nwhere hydrophobia exists his cure is not yet known, and the old\r\nsuperstitions remain. While collecting mammals near San José del Cabo,\r\nin the cape region of Lower California, two summers ago, I found the\r\ncountry people very fearful of wild animals, especially of skunks and\r\ncoyotes. My Mexican boy, whom I had sent on an errand, remained\r\nperched half the afternoon in a thorny mesquite tree because he had\r\nseen a coyote and was afraid it was _rabioso_. But they fear the\r\nskunks most of all because of their habit of approaching men in the\r\nnight while they sleep, and biting them on the toe or ear, or any\r\nexposed part. In defense, unusual precautions are taken to exclude\r\nthem. The windows of the houses are barred with iron, and the doors\r\nare made in halves, horizontally, so that the lower part may be closed\r\nto keep out animals and snakes without interfering with free\r\nventilation. The common people, who live in brush houses, blockade\r\ntheir doorways at night, and rely on their cur dogs to attack any\r\nanimal which may come near.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this evidence, and innumerable ghastly stories, I\r\nremained a month in the country, at the rancho of Francis Pazik, a\r\nvery intelligent and well-educated Bohemian, without seeing any rabid\r\nanimals. Then, one evening just at sundown, a crowd of men came up the\r\npath, leading one of Pazik's mules and dragging the carcass of a\r\nskunk. They said that it had come out into the open field where the\r\nmule was picketed and bitten it on the hind foot. All of them insisted\r\nthat it was rabid, and cited its extreme emaciation as a proof. The\r\nyoung man who dragged it showed me his great toe, half burned off with\r\nblue vitriol, and told me that a skunk had bitten him there two months\r\nbefore, and the doctors had burned it. These native \"doctors\" are\r\nuneducated men who live on the superstition of the people. In the case\r\nof hydrophobia their methods are characteristic. There are in the cane\r\nfields little insect-eating animals called shrews which, in that\r\ncountry, give off a scent so like that of a skunk that Pazik has\r\nhunted them out with his dogs in the night by mistake. The \"doctors\"\r\npay as much as two dollars apiece for shrews on urgent occasions, and,\r\nmixing their bodies with herbs and roots, form a concoction which they\r\nclaim will ward off hydrophobia. Besides this, they also bleed the\r\npatient and cauterize the wound.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mexicans, there are two kinds of rabies: that\r\naffecting the head and that affecting the stomach. When animals have\r\n_rabia_ in the head they become stupid and move about slowly, biting\r\nat everything they see or touch. They are not violent, and become very\r\nthin. But when they have rabies in the stomach it gives them great\r\npain, and they bark and howl and race about frantically, chasing other\r\nanimals and tearing them. Mr. Cipriano Fisher, of Santa Catarina, told\r\nme of his experience with a coyote which had rabies in the stomach. He\r\nwas hunting deer at Cape San Lucas, and had killed two. Carrying the\r\nsmaller one and his gun to camp, he returned unarmed, except for the\r\nknife which every one wears in that region, to bring in the other. As\r\nhe went down a deep cañon he heard a coyote ahead, howling in the\r\npeculiar way which he knew to be characteristic of the _rabioso_. All\r\nthe hunters claim they can recognize the howling of a rabid coyote,\r\nand they say that no other animal will answer it or go near it. The\r\nhowling approached rapidly. Knowing that he could not escape by\r\nrunning back uphill, nor kill it with his knife without being bitten,\r\nhe stepped quickly into the brush and cut a long green club. As he\r\nturned back into the open place he saw the coyote down the cañon,\r\nleaping up and snapping at the air. When the coyote saw him it broke\r\ninto a furious run up the trail, and when, as he says, about thirty\r\nfeet away, made a flying leap at his face. He jumped to one side,\r\nstruck the rabid animal in the back of the head as it passed, and\r\nkilled it with the one blow.\r\n\r\nSkunks are particularly dangerous to persons who sleep out at night.\r\nJ. Ellis McLellan, a field collector of the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture, whom I met at San José del Cabo, told me of an\r\nunpleasant experience he had with a skunk while coming down from La\r\nPaz. On account of the heat he had ridden in the night as far as Agua\r\nCaliente, where he stopped near a ranch house to sleep till morning.\r\nAlthough the night was warm, he covered his head with a _serape_ for\r\nprotection from insects and wandering animals. Early in the morning he\r\nwas awakened by a twitching at his blanket and, raising the _serape_,\r\nsaw a skunk biting and jerking at it. Realizing the gravity of the\r\nsituation, he reached for his heavy knife, and then, suddenly throwing\r\naside the _serape_, he leaned forward and put his whole force into one\r\nblow. As he ducked under the blanket again, for protection, the dogs\r\nfrom the house rushed out in a body and pounced upon the dying skunk,\r\nwhich they worried on top of McLellan until the ranch people beat them\r\noff. When skunks bite at men's toes and ears, or at blankets in this\r\nway, it is taken as an indication that they are rabid.\r\n\r\nShortly after this I saw a young man at Miraflores who had just been\r\nseized with hydrophobia. Two months before he had been bitten on the\r\ngreat toe by a skunk as he lay asleep in his house at Agua Caliente,\r\nbut had shown no symptoms of the disease until that day, when he\r\nsuddenly began to bite at the door jamb in the store at Miraflores.\r\nThey put him into the brick jail, where he soon became very violent.\r\nWhen I went down to the jail the next morning I found a group of\r\nMexicans about the huge wooden door, which was chained fast and tied\r\nwith _riatas_ in addition. From the inside there came a succession of\r\nthumps and blood-curdling groans and strangles. I peered in through\r\nthe barred window, and saw the unfortunate man lying on his back in a\r\ncorner, spasmodically kicking out his legs from his chest and rolling\r\nhis dilated eyes. Suddenly he leaped to his feet and, grasping the\r\niron bars, shook the great door violently, chained and tied as it was.\r\nThen he seemed to leap against the walls, and at last fell down,\r\ngroaning. He soon became rational again, and began to talk through a\r\ncrack in the door to an old man whom I took to be his father. He asked\r\nfor water, but they would not give him any, and while he was pleading\r\nfor a knife or pistol another spasm seized him.\r\n\r\nPresently the judge came over with two policemen. They said they were\r\ngoing to take the _rabioso_ out and tie him to a tree, because he was\r\ngetting the jail too dirty, and might not die for a week. As soon as\r\nthe spasm passed, and the man lay weak and moaning, the burly\r\npolicemen loosed the _riatas_, and, stepping in quickly, seized him\r\nfrom behind. He protested pathetically against going into the hot\r\nsunshine, but they pushed him out and started toward the corral to tie\r\nhim up. But when the fierce sun struck him he was racked by horrible\r\nconvulsions. He kicked and struggled, bit at his shoulders, and blew\r\nspittle into the air when he threw his head back. The policemen\r\nbreathed hard, and the old man, his father, hugged himself in agony as\r\nhe walked behind. There was a desperate struggle, then, with a final\r\nparoxysm, the _rabioso_ suddenly collapsed and hung limp in their\r\narms. At first they thought that he was dead, but when he showed signs\r\nof life they carried him to the corral and tied him to a tree before\r\nhe became conscious. Two days later he died.\r\n\r\nPasteur himself does not undertake to cure patients who have been\r\nseized with spasms; but the judge told me that, fifteen years before,\r\nan Italian doctor had come through their country making marvelous\r\ncures. When he arrived at Miraflores there was a _rabioso_ in the jail\r\nwho was so badly afflicted and so long-lived that the judge had\r\nordered him to be shot. When the Italian doctor heard this, however,\r\nhe asked permission to try an experiment on the man. This being\r\ngranted, he had the patient lassoed, dragged to the river, and held\r\nunder water until he was apparently drowned. After the _rabioso_ was\r\nfull of water, the doctor rolled him on a barrel and resuscitated\r\nhim; then he gave him some medicine which cured him. Cipriano Fisher\r\ntold me that he had cured a valuable bulldog of rabies by this same\r\nmethod, using the bitter juice of the _pitahaya_, a species of cactus,\r\nfor medicine. This crude means of alleged cure is unique, and seems\r\nbased on the theory that the antipathy of rabid animals to water,\r\nimplied in the name hydrophobia, is the cause of their death, and\r\npartial drowning, therefore, a cure.\r\n\r\nRabies is extremely prevalent at times in certain districts of the\r\nCape region. McLellan says it does not occur north of the tropic of\r\nCancer--that is, of La Paz and Todos Santos--and it is hardly known in\r\nthe thickly populated district about San José del Cabo, but at Cape\r\nSan Lucas, and especially also along the base of the mountains near\r\nMiraflores and Agua Caliente, where it is very hot and dry, rabid\r\nanimals are greatly to be feared. While collecting in these mountains\r\nI passed several good ranches which had been deserted because, as my\r\nguide said, stock could not be raised there successfully on account of\r\nthe _rabia_.\r\n\r\nThis man had worked as a _ranchero_ or stock herder for two years on\r\none of these ranches, and had been obliged at one time to kill eleven\r\ncattle and seven sheep and goats in two weeks on account of their\r\nhaving rabies. It was part of his duty to follow up rabid coyotes,\r\nfoxes, skunks, and wild cats when he saw them or heard their peculiar\r\ncry, and shoot them before they bit the stock. But he assured me very\r\ngravely that he preferred to work in the valley for less wages rather\r\nthan have charge of Chollalito rancho; and when we camped there for a\r\nnight he slept on top of the pack boxes, with his bare feet wrapped in\r\nblankets and a _serape_ over his head, and reverently pulled out the\r\nblessed rag he wore around his neck, in order to more surely protect\r\nhimself against the rabid skunks and coyotes. There is, however, very\r\nlittle danger in traveling through this interesting country. Cases of\r\nhydrophobia are comparatively rare, and some scientists who have\r\ncollected in Baja California have even denied its existence there. But\r\nwith the traveler, as with the native, there remains the vague,\r\nconstant, but unrealized expectation of seeing some raging coyote come\r\ntearing through the cactus, or of having his toe bitten in the middle\r\nof the night as he sprawls in the heat and darkness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     PROFESSOR WELLDON, in the British Association, expressed his\r\n     sense of the intellectual insolence of those who presume to say,\r\n     notwithstanding our ignorance of animal characters, that because\r\n     a characteristic seems to us minute and without importance, it is\r\n     therefore without importance to the animal. Until we know the\r\n     function of the animal throughout, and can picture its\r\n     physiological processes thoroughly, we have no right to say, _a\r\n     priori_, that this or that feature is of no use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SENSE OF COLOR.\r\n\r\nBY M. ANDRÉ BRACCHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the different rays of the solar spectrum strike the eye\r\nseparately they each produce a particular characteristic and\r\nsubjective impression, which is called color. Ingenious theories have\r\nbeen set forth by physiologists, like Young, Helmholtz, Hering, and\r\nothers, to explain the perception of colors by our eye, but the\r\nproblem still awaits solution, and is not likely to be explained from\r\nthat side, because it is rather psychical. The laws regulating the\r\nperception of colors are not physiological; we perceive only\r\nrelations. We know that the sense of color may be modified\r\nindependently of that of light and of space. Two phases may be\r\ndistinguished in its evolution. Every light, whether chromatic or not,\r\nproduces a simple luminous impression on the retina--a simple\r\nexcitation of the optic nerve, without being analyzed by it. In the\r\nsecond phase the brain, the psychic center of color, intervenes. There\r\nmay obviously be considerable differences between persons in the\r\ninterpretation of what we call colors, and we may judge that there is\r\nan education of this psychical center, and that it is an important\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nDifferent as the ways of interpreting a sensation of color may be,\r\nthere are still some fundamental ideas in the matter which painters,\r\nfor example, do not all observe. Some, like the impressionists,\r\nexaggerate them, and others neglect them. Which of these are wrong?\r\nand which right? are questions we are not concerned with, our purpose\r\nbeing to show that many of the phenomena of color, shade, sources of\r\nlight, etc., escape a large proportion of persons unless they are\r\nattentive observers. If we visit the exhibitions of the impressionists\r\nwe shall be entertained at the criticisms we hear over the canvases of\r\nsuch painters as Renoir and Monet; youths who have just come out of\r\nthe drawing school declaring that their master never taught them to\r\nput blue on a face, and that in Nature all shadows are gray or black,\r\nand none red or violet; and we should astonish a great many people if\r\nwe should say that a white robe should never be painted in a portrait\r\npicture with white lead alone. \"All skies are blue, all trees are\r\ngreen, all pantaloons are red,\" said a celebrated painter who was\r\ntrying to show how the habit of seeing a colored object in a certain\r\nway prevented one from perceiving the different colors that might be\r\napplied to it. We recollect the trouble of a brave youth who, having\r\nsat for his portrait to a celebrated painter, was distracted at\r\nperceiving green in the reflections of the hair of his likeness. Yet\r\nthere are in Nature shadows that are blue and reflections that are\r\ngreen, and if we do not see them habitually it is because we do not\r\ngive sufficient attention to them.\r\n\r\nA common division of the spectrum is into warm and cold colors. The\r\nwarm colors are red, yellow, orange, and yellow-green; the cold colors\r\nare violet, blue, green, and blue-green. This is not an arbitrary\r\ndivision, but answers to a fact of experience which passes from our\r\nphysical to our moral impressions, and may cause in us feelings of\r\ncomfort or uneasiness, joy, sadness, or moral depression. Some persons\r\nare influenced by the gray-colored sky, others are gay when the day is\r\nbright. It is a current expression that the color of the southern\r\nlandscape is warm. Goethe said that blue caused him to feel cold.\r\n\r\nThe terms warm and cold are technical expressions in the arts. A color\r\ntone is cooled by putting blue in it, and warmed by adding red or\r\nyellow. \"This practice is not arbitrary,\" says M. F. Bracquemond in\r\nhis book on Design and Color; \"it copies the colored aspects which\r\nnatural light imposes on all imitation that seeks to realize the\r\ncolored and factitious light of painting. To reach this, art observes\r\nthe order according to which the natural lights distribute their\r\nvarious colored elements, and classes luminous aspects--a process\r\nwhich it has always observed--into the two categories of warm and\r\ncold. Hence, so far as examples come to us, this contrast is easy to\r\nverify; at the Louvre, for example, in works from Pompeii, and in\r\nthose of all the masters.\" Preyer relies upon this division of colors\r\ninto warm and cold for a comparison of chromatic sensations with\r\nthermic, and for supposing that the color sense is developed from the\r\nsense of temperature. Chromatic sensitiveness to this author is only a\r\nspecial case of thermic sensitiveness limited to the retina. Darwin's\r\nideas were evidently the same; the whole human body was a sort of\r\nretina capable of improvement; we may, it is true, suppose with Lord\r\nKelvin that \"there is absolute continuity between the perception of\r\nheat by the retina of the eye and its perception by means of the\r\ntissues and nerves.\"\r\n\r\nA very elementary experiment will easily enable us to recognize these\r\ndifferent qualities of colors. Set a lighted candle on a table near a\r\nwindow; there are then two sources of light--the daylight, blue and\r\ncold, and the light of the candle, orange-red and warm. Cast a shadow\r\non the white paper by holding a pencil straight up. The shadows cast\r\nby the candle will be blue to a degree that no one can mistake it, a\r\ngreenish blue. Placing the pencil between the window and the candle\r\nand looking at the shadows, we have, first, the blue shadow of the\r\ncandle, and then the shadow projected by the cold daylight. The color\r\nof the last, though perhaps less evident than the other, is an\r\norange-yellow, of rich, warm tone.\r\n\r\nFrom this little experiment we may conclude that a warm light provokes\r\na cold shadow, a cold light a warm shadow, and that the color of the\r\nshadow is complementary to that of the light. In the experiment,\r\ndaylight was the source of the cold light. Let us now take a third\r\nsource of light, warmer than that of the candle, the flame produced by\r\nburning alcohol and salt--a very warm, deep orange light, which makes\r\nthe light of the candle seem cold and its blue shadows appear yellow,\r\nwhile its own shadows are blue.\r\n\r\nWe recently observed a very striking example of these warm and cold\r\nappearances of light; it was at the theater: a beam of red light shone\r\nbrightly upon an actor, whose shadow was absolutely green. Some of the\r\npeople around us were astonished at the phenomenon, which they could\r\nperceive very plainly. Phenomena of this kind are produced every\r\ninstant in a nature illuminated by the sun; nearly all the shadows are\r\ncolored in hues which we can distinguish with a little attention where\r\nthe unpracticed eye sees nothing but gray. Thus in a mountainous\r\ncountry, exposed to the warm light of the sun, the mountains in the\r\nhorizon appear blue through the haze; then, as evening draws on, the\r\nsun appears a deeper orange, more reddish, while the sky seems green\r\nby contrast, and the red rays of the sun falling on the mountains turn\r\nthem violet, in those beautiful tints which give so much glory to\r\nthose countries of large shadows and bright lights.\r\n\r\nHowever intense the light of day may be, it is therefore always\r\ncolored, and gives those colored shadows which painters do not always\r\nobserve. The painter, in fact, should make an analysis of the complex\r\nlight around him, and should repeat the result in synthesis on his\r\ncanvas. Upon hardly any other condition can he represent the\r\ntransparency of the atmosphere, or the luminosity of a subject or a\r\nlandscape. These colored shadows are not, therefore, false colors, as\r\noften seems to be believed, or optical illusions; they are really\r\nexistent, but our eyes are hardly ever practiced enough to discern\r\nthem; we are deficient in education of the color sense. This education\r\nis not hard to attain. There are persons who have special aptitudes\r\nand are consequently remarkable colorists, just as some persons have\r\nan admirably organized ear for music; but, besides these, it is\r\npossible for all persons endowed with the faculty of observing and\r\ncapable of attention to acquire with considerable rapidity the faculty\r\nof discerning colors, where they at present hardly see anything but\r\nconfused gray masses. (The epithet gray, we may observe, is used as\r\napplied to many things the color of which is not susceptible of exact\r\ndetermination.) Such attentive observation of colors is, however,\r\nattended with some danger to painters. Every person prefers some one\r\ncolor, is influenced by a particular shade. When we examine the works\r\nof the painters we see that there are many differences in the way of\r\nseeing. Some see blue, red, green; others see clear, others obscure.\r\nIn the analysis of a complex color it happens that there is sometimes\r\nan auto-suggestion. Where there is a hardly defined violet, the\r\npainter will exaggerate it on his canvas, and will be obliged, in\r\norder to keep up the right tone, to increase the intensity of the\r\ncolors next to it. Hence arises a common error with painters, who\r\nstart with a true principle, but are not able to apply it properly,\r\nand give their picture a tonic violet, green, or yellow, beyond all\r\nreason.--_Translated for the Popular Science Monthly from the Revue\r\nScientifique._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THOMAS EGLESTON.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. DANIEL S. MARTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the work of the scientist is not of a kind to\r\nattract conspicuous notice from the public, especially in great\r\ncities, filled and thrilled with commercial and political activity;\r\nand so it comes to pass that men of rare attainments and untiring\r\nenergy, in the highest walks of life and thought, may spend their\r\nwhole life-time in such an environment, and be scarcely known outside\r\nof a limited circle of kindred minds. They may confer lasting benefits\r\non the community, render important services to the whole country, and\r\nbe widely known and honored in other lands, and yet receive but little\r\ngeneral recognition in the place of their abode.\r\n\r\nSuch a man, in such a community, is Prof. THOMAS EGLESTON, of the city\r\nof New York. He has been too busy and too modest to seek prominence in\r\nthe public eye, and his scientific work has been of a kind that does\r\nnot lend itself readily to popular lectures or startling\r\nannouncements; but as a mineralogist, a metallurgist, and a mining\r\nengineer, and as the planner and founder of the great School of Mines\r\nof Columbia University, he has made a deep and permanent impress on\r\nthe history of science in the United States.\r\n\r\nProfessor Egleston is of New England stock, his ancestors having been\r\namong the first settlers of Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1635. Thence\r\nthey came by a toilsome and perilous journey to Connecticut, and\r\nfounded Windsor, which was thenceforward their home, and whence his\r\nfather came to New York. The removal to Connecticut arose from a\r\ndesire for greater freedom of life and worship than they found in\r\nMassachusetts; and Professor Egleston has been deeply interested in\r\nstudying the little-known records of this movement, and the influence\r\nwhich it exerted, as an almost unwritten chapter in American history.\r\nHe proposes to publish these researches, together with much other\r\nmaterial relating to our colonial history, in which he is an\r\nenthusiastic student.\r\n\r\nHe was born in New York, on December 9, 1832. As a boy he took\r\nconsiderable interest in certain aspects of science, and at the age of\r\nthirteen had gathered a collection of minerals and rocks. He attended\r\nYale College, and in the later years of his course took special\r\nelective work in chemistry. After graduating there in 1854, he was for\r\na time an assistant to Prof. Benjamin Silliman, Jr. Subsequently he\r\nwent abroad, partly for his health, and was advised to spend some time\r\nin Paris. With no special professional purpose, but from a general\r\ndesire to improve his time, he began attending lectures on geology and\r\nchemistry at the Jardin des Plantes, under D'Orbigny (a brother of the\r\neminent writer) and Hilgard, and he worked with much energy in the\r\nlaboratories of those departments at the Jardin. He thus attracted the\r\nattention of some of the faculty of the École des Mines, who offered\r\nhim larger facilities in that institution, which he at once accepted.\r\nAfter much very interesting study in the paleontological laboratory\r\nthere, he decided to go regularly through the entire course, and\r\naccomplished that purpose with notable success and honor, graduating\r\nin 1860. He had worked as an assistant in every laboratory of the\r\nschool, and in the summers had traveled through much of France,\r\nbecoming familiar with its geology, mineral resources, mining works\r\nand processes, and gaining a mastery at first hand of all branches of\r\nthose subjects. Those years were to him full of interest and\r\nenjoyment; friendships were formed that have enriched his whole life;\r\nand in it all the man was being remarkably prepared for the work of\r\ndeveloping those forms of science and of industrial progress in our\r\nown country. Professor Egleston has always retained a strong feeling\r\nof attachment toward the École des Mines, which has likewise been\r\nwarmly reciprocated. He has shown his interest by two gifts to the\r\ninstitution, of five thousand dollars each.\r\n\r\nReturning hither in 1861, just as the war cloud was darkening over\r\nthe land, he received almost immediately an appointment at\r\nWashington, to take charge of the mineralogical collections and\r\nlaboratory of the Smithsonian Institution. After two years there he\r\nconceived the purpose that determined his whole career, and has so\r\ngreatly influenced both American science and American mineral\r\ndevelopment--that of a school of mines at New York.\r\n\r\nAt that time there were, indeed, in this country schools of science,\r\nwell organized and well equipped--the Sheffield School at Yale, the\r\nLawrence Foundation at Harvard, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\r\nat Troy, and others. But their scope was rather general in character,\r\nand there was no institution planned and arranged with distinct\r\nreference to mining and metallurgy as its main subjects. Mr. Egleston,\r\nas he was then known, saw and felt this lack, and planned to supply\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere is not space here to detail the circumstances under which he was\r\nled to prepare, in 1863, the Plan for a School of Mines in New York;\r\nbut the modest little outline then drawn up and printed has been\r\nexceedingly rich in results. It was taken up with interest by certain\r\nleading trustees of Columbia College, as it was then called,\r\nespecially by the late George T. Strong. The president, the late Dr.\r\nCharles King, and a majority of the board, favored the experiment, for\r\nso it was regarded, and arrangements were finally made to begin it in\r\nthe autumn of the next year, in limited quarters in the old college\r\nbuilding on Forty-ninth Street, and with provision for but a small\r\nnumber of students--not over twenty. Part of the instruction was to be\r\ngiven by members of the existing college faculty; and three new\r\nprofessors were appointed to special chairs for the school, to be\r\ncompensated wholly by fees therefrom. These were, Professor Egleston,\r\nmineralogy and metallurgy; Prof. Francis Vinton, mining engineering;\r\nand Dr. C. F. Chandler, chemistry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in June, 1864, President King was succeeded by the late Dr.\r\nBarnard, whose strong interest in science made him a warm supporter of\r\nthe school. Already some prominent people were impressed with the\r\nvalue of such a movement, and disposed to aid it. A fine collection of\r\nminerals was purchased and presented by Mr. Strong, and another was\r\ngiven by Mr. Gouverneur Kemble.\r\n\r\nOn the opening day, November 15, 1864, the number of applicants was\r\nfar beyond expectation and provision; the school was found to respond\r\nto a need and a demand that had not been suspected; it was a success\r\nfrom the first. In a year or two it had become an institution of\r\nrecognized importance; ample quarters were provided for it in a large\r\nbuilding, formerly a manufactory, on the Fourth Avenue side of the\r\ncollege block, and important additions were made to its corps of\r\ninstructors--particularly the eminent geologist, Dr. J. S. Newberry,\r\nof Cleveland, Ohio, whose noble geological collection was deposited\r\nand used in the School of Mines, and whose breadth and power and\r\npersonal magnetism so profoundly influenced scientific interest and\r\nprogress in the city of New York for more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nSuch was the beginning of the school; its career has been one of\r\nunbroken growth and increasing influence. After some ten years it was\r\nfound needful to take down the plain old transformed factory and erect\r\na new building on its site, with larger space and improved facilities.\r\nFifteen years later Columbia College was removed to its new site on\r\nthe Morningside Heights, where now the School of Mines is installed in\r\nstately fireproof structures, wherein its great accumulated treasures\r\nof collections, apparatus, models, and varied appliances of\r\ninstruction are safely and permanently housed.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this school upon science in New York city has been\r\nincalculable. Only those who have lived in touch with the scientific\r\nlife of the metropolis during the period since the close of the civil\r\nwar can appreciate the change that has taken place in public feeling\r\nregarding science, or can recognize how largely that change is due to\r\nthe existence of such an institution, and to the presence of such a\r\nbody of strong and able professors, in constant and active\r\nco-operation in the interest of science. The school attracted notice\r\nfrom the first, abroad as well as throughout this country. In 1871,\r\nseven years from its opening, a writer in the North American Review\r\ncharacterized it as \"already more scientific than Freiberg, more\r\npractical than Paris,\" and emphasized its influence both upon science\r\nand upon mining interests in the United States, pointing out that the\r\nliterature pertaining to mines and their working had been very limited\r\nin the English language, and that the instruction in the school had to\r\nbe chiefly given by lectures; but that these courses would gradually\r\ndevelop into a literature.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions have been fully justified by the results of the last\r\nquarter century. The vast development of our mineral resources has\r\nbeen largely under the direction of graduates of this school. Hundreds\r\nof them are to-day in important positions of scientific trust, not\r\nonly throughout our own country but in South and Central America,\r\nAustralia, China, Japan, and even Europe itself. The lectures of the\r\nprofessors, and the articles constantly published in the School of\r\nMines Quarterly, have indeed given us a literature of the subject in\r\nEnglish. The local influence in the city has been great, upon\r\nscientific education in secondary schools, and upon general public\r\nsentiment; while in Columbia University the experiment has become one\r\nof its finest departments and an element of its greatest strength.\r\nRarely is it given to a man to see in his life-time so great a result\r\nfrom the plans and the labors of his earlier years.\r\n\r\nOf the many forms of scientific activity which have engaged Professor\r\nEgleston during his busy life, only the briefest mention can be made.\r\nHe was one of the founders of the American Institute of Mining\r\nEngineers, was thrice its vice-president, and was chosen president in\r\n1886; and he has published over one hundred articles in its\r\nTransactions. He was one of the founders of the American Metrological\r\nSociety, and of the societies of Mechanical Engineers and of\r\nElectrical Engineers, and a member of the society of Civil Engineers\r\nand of the Iron and Steel Institute of Great Britain. In the New York\r\nAcademy of Sciences he was active for many years, and held the\r\nvice-presidency from 1869 to 1881. In 1866 Professor Egleston was\r\nassociated with the Agricultural and Geological Survey of the Union\r\nPacific Railroad; in 1868 was appointed a United States Commissioner\r\nto examine the fortifications of the coast; and in 1873 was one of the\r\njurors for the International Exposition at Vienna. From Princeton and\r\nTrinity Colleges he received, in 1874, the degrees of Ph. D. and LL.\r\nD., respectively, and from the Government of France the rank of a\r\nChevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1890, and the exceptional rank of\r\n\"Officier\" in 1895.\r\n\r\nHis papers, published either separately or in the proceedings of the\r\nseveral engineering societies above mentioned, the Annals of the New\r\nYork Academy of Sciences, the School of Mines Quarterly, etc., cover a\r\nwide range of subjects connected with mineralogy, metallurgy, and\r\nmining operations. In mineralogy he was especially devoted to\r\ncrystallography, and his noble private collection was gathered and\r\narranged with relation to that department. Besides his strictly\r\nmetallurgical articles and treatises, he has dealt with such topics as\r\nrails, in relation to accidents; furnaces and their construction;\r\nfire-brick and refractory substances; slags and their utilization,\r\netc.; the decay of building stones, in connection with the Obelisk;\r\ntechnical education, manual training, and improvement in the\r\nconditions of workingmen in mining and metallurgical occupations.\r\n\r\nHis chief published works are The Metallurgy of Gold, Silver, and\r\nMercury in the United States, two large volumes, 1887 and 1890, and\r\nhis Lectures on Mineralogy, to which may be added his Tables for the\r\nDetermination of Minerals, Metallurgical Tables on Fuels, Iron, and\r\nSteel, diagrams and comparisons of crystals and crystal notation,\r\ntables of production of many of the metals, report on the Union\r\nPacific Railroad survey of 1868, and many others.\r\n\r\nWithin the past two years Professor Egleston has withdrawn from active\r\nwork in the School of Mines, and bears now the title of Professor\r\nEmeritus; his health has been a good deal impaired, and his work has\r\npassed largely into the charge of younger men who have grown up under\r\nhis direction as students and assistants. During the last winter he\r\nhas presented to the school his entire scientific library and his\r\nprivate collection of minerals above referred to, some six thousand\r\nspecimens. These, in addition to the great mineralogical treasures\r\nalready possessed by the institution, all gathered and arranged under\r\nhis supervision, will make the School of Mines collection certainly\r\none of the finest in the country.\r\n\r\nAlthough devoted to his own special branches, Professor Egleston had\r\ngiven a striking example of broad interest in other departments of\r\nscience in his labor of love in connection with the monument to the\r\nmemory of the great ornithologist Audubon. The present writer was\r\nclosely associated with him in this work, and can testify to his\r\nenergy, enthusiasm, and perseverance therein. The later years of\r\nAudubon's life had been spent on Manhattan Island, in a modest but\r\nbeautiful suburban home on the Hudson, above Harlem, known as Audubon\r\nPark. He died in 1851, and was buried in a family vault in Trinity\r\nCemetery, then far out of town, now lying between One hundred and\r\nFifty-third and One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Streets, Amsterdam Avenue,\r\nand the Hudson. The spot was remote and almost unknown, and with the\r\ndeath and removal of most of the family, it had fallen into neglect.\r\nWhen One Hundred and Fifty-third Street was to be opened through to\r\nthe river, the vault, which was close to the street line, was in\r\ndanger of injury; and then Professor Egleston took up the matter and\r\nproposed to the trustees of the cemetery that if they would grant\r\nanother plot in a better location, he would endeavor to have a\r\nhandsome monument erected by national subscription. The trustees\r\nresponded warmly, and Professor Egleston undertook the work. Before\r\ngoing abroad in 1887 he broached the subject to the writer, and\r\nsuggested that he present it during the meeting of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, which was to be held\r\nduring that summer in New York. The writer gladly responded to the\r\nplan, and in August of that year laid the facts before a general\r\nmeeting of the association. Much interest was expressed, but no action\r\nwas taken, as had been hoped. At the first regular meeting of the New\r\nYork Academy of Sciences, in October, the writer again presented the\r\nsubject, with better result; and a committee was appointed by the\r\nacademy, consisting of Professor Egleston as chairman, Dr. N. L.\r\nBritton, and the writer. On the return of the former from Europe the\r\nwork was taken up in earnest; and under the indefatigable efforts of\r\nthe chairman and of the secretary, Dr. Britton, although with many\r\ndelays and discouragements, it was carried to a triumphant success.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year (1887) the committee had held numerous\r\nmeetings, prepared and issued a circular, and engaged the co-operation\r\nof several other organizations with the Academy of Sciences, including\r\nthe American Ornithologists' Union, the Agassiz Association, and the\r\nAudubon Society (for the protection of our native birds). A design was\r\nproposed by the academy's committee, and adopted by the joint\r\ncommittee of the several societies; this design originated with\r\nProfessor Egleston, and was a striking combination of the religious,\r\nscientific, and artistic elements appropriate to the purpose. The\r\nscheme was that of a Runic cross, the only form of that Christian\r\nsymbol which can properly bear ornamental devices, according to the\r\ncanons of artists and architects, and this was to be covered with\r\nreliefs of the birds, quadrupeds, and flowers that Audubon so loved\r\nand studied, and that have given him his fame as the artist-naturalist\r\nof America. The general design being approved, the selection and\r\narrangement of the animals and birds was given to a subcommittee of\r\nspecialists, consisting of Dr. J. A. Allen, Mr. G. B. Sennett, and Dr.\r\nN. L. Britton, whose duty was to secure accurate representation and\r\nartistic grouping of the forms.\r\n\r\nIn all these combined aspects this monument is doubtless unique. As it\r\nstands to-day over the grave of him whom it commemorates--graceful,\r\ndignified, and altogether peculiar--it is an honor to our city, as\r\nwell as a fitting tribute to the memory of Audubon, the Nature-lover,\r\nthe artist, and the Christian believer. For this beautiful thought, so\r\nnobly carried out, both American science and the city of New York are\r\nindebted to Thomas Egleston.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the effort was slow; it was not until 1891 that\r\nsufficient subscriptions were secured, and not until the spring of\r\n1893 that all was ready for the formal ceremonies. During all this\r\ntime Professor Egleston and Dr. Britton were untiring in their\r\nendeavors and unfaltering in their purpose to succeed. On April 26,\r\n1893, the monument was dedicated with suitable exercises, of great\r\ninterest, at Trinity Cemetery, and a memorial address upon the life\r\nand work of Audubon was delivered by Mr. Daniel G. Elliott, F. R. S.\r\nE., of the Ornithologists' Union, at a public meeting at the American\r\nMuseum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nProfessor Egleston has also laid the citizens of New York under\r\nenduring obligation to him in another and even more important matter,\r\nthe preservation of one of the most valuable of our smaller parks from\r\nthe clutches of the speculator and spoiler. It is known to but few of\r\nthe residents of the city that a series of determined attempts was\r\nmade, some years ago, to destroy and obliterate Washington Square, in\r\nthe same way in which the St. John's Park outrage was perpetrated ten\r\nyears before. The method pursued in that case was by interested\r\nparties buying up property around the park and \"colonizing\" the houses\r\nwith tenants who would either favor or consent to the vandal\r\nobliteration of that beautiful spot of rest and shade for the erection\r\nthereon of the Hudson River Railroad freight depot. St. John's Park,\r\nhowever, was the property partly of a corporation, partly of\r\nindividuals, and the job was comparatively easy. Washington Square\r\nbelonged to the city; but the same process was begun by a great\r\nreal-estate magnate, and was going on toward a similar result, when\r\nthe death of the arch-conspirator checked the scheme for a time. A\r\nlittle later, however, it was revived, under the notorious Tweed\r\n_régime_, and would have succeeded but for the keen insight and\r\nvigorous action of a few public-spirited citizens, led by Professor\r\nEgleston. Washington Square had been dug over and torn up, under the\r\npretext of remodeling and \"improvement,\" and the unsightly mounds and\r\npiles of earth were left for many months, not only to offend the eye,\r\nbut to generate malaria. The ground had been originally a Potter's\r\nField, and the opening and upturning of the soil, frequently unhealthy\r\nin its effect, was markedly so in that case. The south side of the\r\nsquare had been \"worked\" already, in the first attempt, and had\r\nlargely lost its population of old residents; but the north side was\r\nstill occupied by a select class of old New-Yorkers. Now, however,\r\nbetween the desolate aspect of the park and the malaria that began to\r\nbe felt, an exodus of the owners on the north side was imminent. Then\r\nbegan to be hinted some schemes for which all this was preparatory. A\r\ngreat militia armory was to be erected on the western end, and other\r\nprojects vaguely loomed up, involving the ruin of the park as such. A\r\nbill to legalize these schemes was quietly introduced at Albany, and\r\nhad been brought nearly to its passage, by \"influences\" no less potent\r\nfor their careful concealment. Professor Egleston and a few other\r\ngentlemen of the vicinity were anxious about these rumors, but could\r\nget no information. Inquiries from city officials were met with\r\npositive denial of any such intentions, and it was only within a few\r\ndays of the time set for the passage of the bill that they succeeded\r\nin discovering its real meaning.\r\n\r\nAt this late juncture the \"Public Parks Protective Association\" was\r\nquietly and quickly organized by a small body of public-spirited men,\r\nof whom the late John Jay was president and Professor Egleston\r\nsecretary. This association set itself to work most earnestly to\r\nreveal the danger, to arouse public sentiment and public protest, and\r\nto make these felt in the Capitol at Albany. Circulars and petitions\r\nwere prepared and widely disseminated, at the cost of great labor,\r\nwithin the brief time left ere the bill should come up for passage.\r\nThe New York Academy of Sciences, speaking in the interest of public\r\nhealth, passed strong resolutions of remonstrance; and various other\r\nbodies took similar action, including the Academy of Medicine.\r\n\r\nThe result was that legislators were aroused, some to the real\r\ncharacter of measures that they had not fully understood, and others\r\nto the existence of a public sentiment upon which they had not\r\ncounted, and the bill failed to pass. Nor was this all: a resolution\r\nwas adopted, prepared by the association, guaranteeing the ground\r\noccupied by the square to be kept \"forever\" as a park for purposes of\r\npublic health and recreation.\r\n\r\nThat Washington Square remains to-day, an oasis of beauty in the\r\ndesert of brick and stone, and a breathing place in that densely built\r\nportion of the great city, is due principally to the watchfulness and\r\nenergy of Professor Egleston. He it was who saved that park to the\r\npeople of New York, and a debt of lasting gratitude therefore is owing\r\nhim from them. This is an unwritten episode in the history of our\r\ncity, and the present writer, who knew something of the facts at the\r\ntime, is gratified to be able to put them on record now. But let us\r\nnot fail to note the lesson that they convey. \"Eternal vigilance is\r\nthe price\" of all that is valuable in a community like ours, where the\r\ndemands of business greed and the devices of political schemers and\r\n\"bosses\" may at any time unite again, as in the past, for acts of\r\nprofitable vandalism, and dismiss as \"sentimental\" all considerations\r\nof beauty, health, or historical association. The sanitary importance\r\nof our smaller parks is now better understood; and the city is buying\r\nproperty for such purposes at heavy cost, in localities where fifty\r\nyears ago parks could have been laid out at little expense, and\r\nmaintained at a vast saving of human health and life. Such articles,\r\nalso, as that of Dr. Stephen Smith, in the February number of this\r\nmonthly, are educating the intelligent community as to the sanitary\r\nvalue of vegetation in cities. But nothing is safe or sacred where the\r\nevil trinity of the boss, the speculator, and the \"soulless\"\r\ncorporation may combine their forces; and the call is for ceaseless\r\nwatchfulness.\r\n\r\nProfessor Egleston has been all his life in active association with\r\nthe religious and benevolent work of the Episcopal Church. He became\r\npresident of the Bible and Common Prayer-Book Society in 1871; was\r\nvice-president of the Protestant Episcopal City Mission Society from\r\n1870 to 1897; a trustee of the General Theological Seminary, and a\r\nmember of the corporation of Trinity Church from 1878. In connection\r\nwith the last-named body some of his relations have an interest wider\r\nthan his own denomination, and may fittingly be mentioned in a sketch\r\nrelating chiefly to his scientific career. Two points may here be\r\nnoted: the schools among the poorer classes maintained by the Trinity\r\ncorporation; and the unique jeweled chalice in memory of his wife,\r\npresented by him to Trinity Church.\r\n\r\nAided and controlled more or less by Trinity corporation, though in\r\ndifferent parts of the city and in connection with different Episcopal\r\nchurches, are now eight schools, with about one thousand pupils. In\r\nthese are taught careful and scientific methods of training along\r\nmodern lines, of eye and hand development, hygiene, economy, and\r\nthrift, to children and youth of the neediest classes. Already for\r\nyears much interested in these schools, Professor Egleston has, since\r\nhis withdrawal from professional activity, given much of his time to\r\ntheir advancement, and has found intense gratification in observing\r\nthe results of this training among a class of children that, from\r\ntheir general environment, would grow up to be a burden or a menace to\r\nthe city. The intelligent culture of hand and eye, the mental\r\nquickening and moral uplifting, the capacity and purpose of honorable\r\nself-support, and the protection from moral and social perils, that\r\nare imparted and secured through the agency of these schools, are to\r\nhim a constant source of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe jeweled chalice above referred to is of scientific interest from\r\nthe great variety and rarity of the gems with which it is set. During\r\nyears of travel to and from many parts of Europe, Professor Egleston\r\nhad remarkable opportunities, in his visits to mining regions and his\r\nintercourse with mineralogists, to obtain fine and choice specimens of\r\ngems; these he had mounted in elegant forms as presents to his wife,\r\nMrs. Augusta McVickar Egleston. Her death, in 1895, was a very great\r\nblow to her husband, as their married life had been extremely happy;\r\nand the only satisfactory use to which this beautiful treasure of\r\njewelry could be put seemed to him to be in the services of divine\r\nworship in the church. It is not possible in brief compass, without a\r\nfigure, to describe the arrangement of these jewels on the base, stem,\r\nand cup of the golden chalice; but it must suffice to say that there\r\nare one hundred and eighty stones set in, with embossed work, on a cup\r\nand pedestal nine inches high and half that width. The species and\r\nvarieties number fifteen, many of them in rare shades of color; among\r\nthem are the ruby-colored Siriam garnets, green \"demantoid\" garnets of\r\nthe Ural (\"Uralian emerald\"), Ceylonese moonstones, colored diamonds,\r\nsapphires, both yellow and green (Oriental topaz and emerald),\r\nrubellites, red zircon, moldavite (the rare green obsidian of\r\nMoravia), green tourmaline, chrysoberyl, the rich purple amethysts of\r\nthe Urals, etc. Considered either mineralogically or as a work of art,\r\nthis chalice is almost unique; while the conception and designing,\r\nwhich are wholly of Professor Egleston's own, reveal the same union of\r\nartistic and scientific qualities that was shown in the Audubon\r\nmonument above mentioned, joined with a religious and a personal\r\nsentiment almost too sacred to dwell upon in a sketch like the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn all these aspects of his life and work, as we said at the\r\nbeginning, Professor Egleston has been little known to the general\r\npublic; but among scientific and engineering circles he has been\r\nhighly honored. In these pages he may become more widely known, and\r\nthe people of the metropolis and of the country at large may learn\r\nsomething of the manner of man that has lived and labored so honorably\r\namong them, and has done so much for science and his fellow-men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor's Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SCIENCE AND THE IDEAL._\r\n\r\nWe have had frequent occasion in these columns to refer to the tirades\r\nagainst science indulged in by writers who, because they can not quite\r\nmake ends meet in their philosophy of the universe, strangely allow\r\nthemselves to think that _science_ must be at fault. At one moment it\r\nis M. Brunetière, at another Tolstoi, at another it is a Harvard\r\nprofessor or a Western school superintendent; but no very long time\r\nelapses before we find somebody in very unnecessary trouble, as it\r\nseems to us, over the shortcomings of science. The last sufferer to\r\nwhom our attention has been drawn is Dr. John Beattie Crozier, the\r\nauthor of two able works--Civilization and Progress, and History of\r\nIntellectual Development--who has lately written a history of his own\r\nintellectual development under the title of My Inner Life. This writer\r\ndescribes the effect upon his mind of a study of Mr. Spencer's\r\nPrinciples of Psychology. \"Then it was,\" he says, \"that the ideal\r\nwithin me, struck to the heart, shriveled and collapsed.\" This sad\r\nresult was due to the discovery, forced on him by a study of the work\r\nin question, that all our mental experiences have equally a material\r\nbasis, and that from a material point of view or, as we may say, seen\r\nfrom below, one thought or feeling is as much justified as any other.\r\nPreviously he had considered that \"such higher faculties as\r\nveneration, benevolence, conscientiousness, and the like, were quite\r\ndistinct in essential nature from low ones, like revenge, lust,\r\nvanity, cowardice, and deceit\"; but now \"all this was changed, and all\r\nthe faculties alike, the high and the low, the noble and the base, the\r\nheroic and the self-indulgent, lay on a dead level of moral and\r\nspiritual equality ... all alike being but vibrations, vibrations,\r\nvibrations, nothing more.\" Consequently, \"the dethroned Ideal fell\r\nprone and headlong like a false and usurping spirit; and my mind,\r\nbereaved of that which had been its life, settled into a deep and\r\nwhat, for a year or two, threatened to be a permanent intellectual\r\ngloom.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a great pity that at this critical moment a very simple\r\nconsideration did not occur to this troubled spirit. When we read the\r\nSermon on the Mount we read \"words, words, words\"; when we read some\r\nhorrible piece of profanity or indecency it is again \"words, words,\r\nwords\"; when we read the demonstration of a proposition in Euclid it\r\nis \"words, words, words\"; and, again, when we take up Tennyson's In\r\nMemoriam we find that its whole tissue is \"words, words, words.\" But\r\nwould it tend in the least to lessen one's reverence for the Sermon on\r\nthe Mount to be reminded that it was constructed out of the same\r\nverbal elements as the piece of profanity? or would it diminish our\r\nadmiration for In Memoriam to be told that it was constructed of words\r\njust like the dullest piece of prose? If not, then why should one be\r\nso terribly disconcerted and depressed to find that all our mental\r\nlife finds its basis in vibrations? Or why should the inference be\r\ndrawn that, because the basis is one, all that reposes on it must also\r\nbe one in character and meaning? Is our delight in the lily or the\r\nrose impaired by the reflection that it springs from the same soil\r\nthat produces noisome weeds; or do we gaze on the humming bird with\r\nless admiration because it flies in the same atmosphere as the bat?\r\nWhy should \"vibrations\" not be the condition of existence of one\r\nmental phenomenon as well as of another? Surely the very fact that Dr.\r\nCrozier classes all the feelings he mentions as mental affections\r\nshould prepare him to believe that they have a common basis. But how\r\nfeelings shall be classified and ranked _after they have taken form_\r\nis a question precisely similar to the question how the various\r\ncombinations of words should be classified and ranked. In the latter\r\ncase words are the basis of them all, but we say: \"This is an epic\r\npoem; this is a moral essay; this is an immoral novel; this is a silly\r\njoke; this is a market report.\" Are these distinctions illusory\r\nbecause words are the basis and substance of all these various forms\r\nof composition? Does the poem lose anything of its beauty, or the\r\nessay anything of its ethical value, because each was not composed of\r\nelements altogether peculiar to itself? The solid globe itself was\r\nonce a diffused nebula, but we do not on that account find a less\r\nvaried beauty in flower and tree, in hillside and running brook and\r\ngrandly flowing river.\r\n\r\nIn his sad condition of mental disarray our author betook himself, he\r\nsays, to the counsels of Thomas Carlyle. That sage, when he heard that\r\nhis visitor had been reading Spencer, made some uncomplimentary\r\nremarks about the latter which we hardly think the visitor was\r\njustified in repeating. Apart from this, Carlyle told him in effect\r\nthat, as he was in the world, he had just to make the best of it, and\r\nthat in time he would find work that he could do with benefit to\r\nhimself and others. Finally, our author made what he calls a discovery\r\nand offers as a contribution to modern philosophy--namely, that in the\r\nmind of man there is a \"scale,\" according to which thoughts and\r\nfeelings are appraised. Some are high up on the scale and some are low\r\ndown. He found that there is that _in_ the mind which is not _of_ the\r\nmind, and which sits in judgment on all the contents of the\r\nmind--something which smiles on every right action and frowns on every\r\nwrong one, and yet which he does not care to speak of as conscience.\r\nHere was the antidote he required to the \"pure and undiluted\r\nmaterialism\" which had so paralyzed his moral being in the Principles\r\nof Psychology; and, having obtained it, he has been living happily, as\r\nwe gather, ever since.\r\n\r\nWe have tried to do justice to the originality of Dr. Crozier's\r\nconception, but really with indifferent success. That there is a scale\r\nby which we are all accustomed to measure the varying values of our\r\nthoughts, feelings, and actions hardly needs to be stated; and that\r\nthere is substantial agreement between men on the same plane of\r\ncivilization as to the relative values of different mental products is\r\nalso unquestionably true. What our author has not shown is how this\r\nconflicts with the strict scientific position taken in the Principles\r\nof Psychology. He does not tell us that he has repudiated the\r\nteachings of that work; indeed, he gives us distinctly to understand\r\nthat, so far as it affirms the dependence of thought upon physical\r\norganization, he adheres to it still. If so, he has only built upon it\r\na superstructure which it was always open to him to build; so, why he\r\nshould find fault with the foundation it is not easy to see. Science\r\ngoes as far as she can see her way to go in setting forth the\r\nrelations between the mind of man and the environing universe. It\r\nstudies also the human mind in its historical manifestations, and\r\ntries to unfold the laws of human conduct. It confines itself to facts\r\nwhich are believed to admit of verification and to inferences which\r\nhave been tested by experience. This is the contribution of Science\r\nto the theory of human life. But because Science stops here she does\r\nnot lay any veto on thought, desire, or hope. She lays a foundation;\r\nit is for us to build thereon \"gold, silver, precious stones, wood,\r\nhay, stubble,\" each of us according to our own impulse and upon our\r\nown responsibility. The fire of experience will \"try every man's work\r\nof what sort it is.\" But not only may we build, we must build; no one\r\ncan live upon another man's philosophy. We may adopt this creed or\r\nthat, but it means nothing to us till we have worked it over in our\r\nown mind and made it our own--with modifications.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing whatever in science that conflicts with the ideal.\r\nStrictly speaking, science brings us to the threshold of the ideal,\r\nand leaves us there. \"These are the facts of life,\" it says; \"such has\r\nbeen the course of human history. The human race has risen from humble\r\norigins to its present commanding position in the world; and to-day\r\nthe standards of human conduct and the conditions of human happiness\r\nare very different from what they were in the distant past. Social\r\nties have multiplied and strengthened. Domestic affections have grown\r\nin depth and tenderness, and individual happiness is now bound up to a\r\nvery large extent in the happiness of other individuals. The cruel\r\nsuperstitions of the past have given way in many minds to a reverent\r\nregard for a power which is felt to rule in the universe. Of such a\r\npower Science can not render any exact account; but before all the\r\nultimate questions of existence Science is dumb; nor can it attempt to\r\nreconcile the antinomies which assert themselves in all phenomena. It\r\nis for you, the individual, entering upon life, to make your choice of\r\nthe course you shall hold and the principles by which you shall be\r\ngoverned. The senses are the guides to immediate pleasure, but the\r\nexperience of the ages has settled with considerable approach to\r\ncertainty the conditions on which enduring happiness is to be won.\r\n\r\n      \"'Choose well; your choice is\r\n      Brief and yet endless.'\"\r\n\r\nTo the man who insists on being knocked down with a club before he\r\nwill yield to persuasion there is nothing in such a mode of address\r\nthat will be convincing. This is a case in which, as Pascal says,\r\n\"there is enough light for those who desire to see, and enough\r\nobscurity for those who want a pretext for not seeing.... Perfect\r\nclearness might help the understanding, but it would injure the will.\"\r\nThere is, therefore, room on the scientific foundation for the\r\nidealism of Dr. Crozier, and for many other forms of idealism. It is\r\nfor each one of us to construct his own ideal, and, having constructed\r\nit, to live by it. \"If any man's work abide he shall receive a\r\nreward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_RACIAL GEOGRAPHY._\r\n\r\nThe interesting papers contributed to this magazine by Prof. William\r\nZ. Ripley, which, we are glad to say, will soon be published in a more\r\npermanent form, indicate very clearly the remarkable progress that has\r\nbeen made of late years in the scientific study of human origins.\r\nFormerly legend and tradition were the only sources of light upon\r\nprehistoric times; and the sagacious Thucydides dismissed all\r\nspeculation respecting those ages with the curt remark that he did not\r\nthink the people who lived then amounted to much, any way. No doubt he\r\nwas nearer right in this opinion than were those who peopled antiquity\r\nwith demigods and heroes; still there was much of interest to be\r\ngleaned respecting the prehistoric past if only right methods of\r\nresearch had been used. This was too much to expect in his day; and,\r\nindeed, it is only in very recent times that the study of human\r\norigins has been placed upon anything like an adequate scientific\r\nbasis. A reference to Mr. Ripley's work will show how numerous are the\r\nlines of investigation now pursued. Language, which at one time was\r\nconsidered an all-important test of origin, has fallen from its high\r\nposition; and theories which, on the strength of linguistic evidence,\r\nwere very widely entertained, have lost their authority. Particularly\r\nhas this been the case with the so-called \"Aryan\" theory. It was\r\nsimple and beautiful and interesting, but as observations accumulated\r\nit became more and more untenable, until finally it had to be\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nThe problems which the anthropologist and ethnologist attack are\r\nindeed of the highest degree of complexity. If our predecessors went\r\nastray therein, we ourselves are only feeling our way very cautiously\r\nand somewhat uncertainly. We have not yet reached an era of victorious\r\ngeneralizations. Professor Ripley well indicates the difficulties of\r\nthe research. Things will go well for a considerable time along\r\ncertain lines of observation until the facts come to be gleaned in\r\nsome special field, and then the result will perhaps be just the\r\nopposite of what theory required. In a brachycephalic region, for\r\nexample, where craniological and other tests call for a population of\r\nshort stature, the stature will reveal itself as much above the\r\naverage. In a region where, looking at race characteristics as\r\nelsewhere established, the tendency, say, to suicide should be\r\nparticularly low, it is found by statistics to be particularly high.\r\nThe ethnologist finds his path strewn with endless difficulties of\r\nthis nature, and yet he is not discouraged. The truth lies somewhere,\r\nand he knows that a vigorous and courageous sifting of the facts will\r\nbe sure to bring it to light, if not to-day, to-morrow. We gather from\r\nProfessor Ripley's pages a strong impression of the confident patience\r\nwith which the true man of science attacks his problems; he is sure\r\nthat his _methods_ are right, and that in the end they must triumph.\r\n\r\nThe interesting points of view which the study of racial geography\r\npresents are numberless. This is particularly shown in Professor\r\nRipley's chapter on Modern Social Problems. In this chapter the writer\r\nacknowledges, as he does elsewhere, that theories of race and of\r\nheredity have sometimes been pushed too far. He demands a due\r\nrecognition of the influence of environment, and cites cases where\r\nenvironment will explain divergences from what are recognized as race\r\ncharacteristics or tendencies. An example of this is afforded by the\r\ncase of Brittany, in connection with separateness of home life. The\r\npopulation of Brittany belongs to a race that is particularly prone to\r\nsuch separateness, and yet in Brittany there is an unusual\r\nintermingling of families under one roof. We can not enter into the\r\nexplanation here, but Professor Ripley shows how the physical\r\ngeography of the country may account for the variation from type. In\r\nthe same chapter the writer shows very interestingly how the Celtic\r\nparts of France manifest almost invariably conservative tendencies:\r\nhow they shun divorce, afford a very low rate of suicide, and, in the\r\nmatter of crime, tend rather to deeds of violence than to acts of\r\ndishonesty. The general impression which the intelligent reader will\r\ngather from the whole work is that \"racial geography\" has all the\r\ninterest of a rapidly growing science; but that, while much has been\r\naccomplished, much more remains to be done. The lines of research are\r\nmany, and we may reasonably hope that before long the combined labors\r\nof anthropologist, ethnologist, and sociologist will give us a\r\ncoherent body of knowledge and theory which shall not only illuminate\r\nthe past but be of the very highest value for the comprehension of the\r\nproblems of our own day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL BOOKS.\r\n\r\nIn a study of what constitutes the foundations of zoölogy we know of\r\nno one better equipped to discuss the various problems than Professor\r\nBrooks.[V] As an original investigator in many groups of invertebrate\r\nzoölogy, as a student of animal life in temperate and tropical seas,\r\nas a special teacher of embryology and zoölogy for a quarter of a\r\ncentury, and, above all, as a profound student of the philosophical\r\nliterature of the subject, his equipment is thorough and complete. A\r\nfair review of this work would be difficult without voluminous\r\nquotations from its pages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote V: The Foundations of Zoölogy. A Course of Lectures\r\ndelivered at Columbia University on the Principles of Science as\r\nillustrated by Zoölogy. By William Keith Brooks, Ph. D., LL. D.,\r\nProfessor of Zoölogy at Johns Hopkins University. Pp. 339. The\r\nMacmillan Company.]\r\n\r\nThe reader will find here the soundest, healthiest acceptance of the\r\nDarwinian theory of natural selection. He penetrates the mists and\r\nfogs of philosophical vagaries and follows the dictum of Tyndall, who,\r\nin presenting the essentials of a discussion, says, \"Not with the\r\nvagueness belonging to the emotions, but with the definiteness\r\nbelonging to the understanding\" we are to study these matters. It is\r\nfact, fact, fact. The honest \"I do not know\" inspires the reader with\r\na confidence that obscure points are not to be juggled with. He\r\ninsists that the principles of science are physical, that a mechanical\r\ninterpretation of Nature is reasonable and just. Referring to Huxley,\r\nhe remarks that faith and hope are good things, no doubt, and (quoting\r\nfrom Huxley) \"expectation is permissible when belief is not,\" but\r\nexperience teaches that expectation or faith of a master is very apt\r\nto become belief in the mind of the student,\" and (again from Huxley)\r\n\"Science warns us that the assertion which outstrips evidence is not\r\nonly a blunder but a crime.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapter of Nature and Nurture he brings many potent facts and\r\narguments against the idea of the transmission of acquired traits.\r\nWithout copious extracts it is impossible to do justice to this\r\nmasterly presentation of the subject. The chapter abounds in\r\naphorisms, as indeed do other portions of the work; and these alone,\r\nif serially collated with their contexts, would make a valuable little\r\nhandbook for the student of biology. His chapter on Lamarck is equally\r\nstrong, and the fallacies of Lamarckianisms have never been so clearly\r\nshown. \"The contrast between what we may call the solicitude of Nature\r\nto secure the production of new beings, and the ruthlessness with\r\nwhich they are sacrificed after they have come into existence, is a\r\nstumbling-block to the Lamarckian, and the crowning glory of natural\r\nselection in that it solves this great enigma of Nature by showing\r\nthat it is itself an adaptation and a means to an end, for the\r\nsacrifice of individuals is the means for perfecting the adjustments\r\nof living things to the world around them and for thus increasing the\r\nsum of life.\" \"Whole books have been written on the marvelous fitness\r\nof the structure, the instincts, and the habits of the worker of the\r\nhoneybee for its life of active industry--a life in which the male has\r\nno share, and from which the female is cut off by her seclusion in the\r\ndepths of the hive, and by her devotion to her own peculiar duties.\r\nWhile the queen and the drones are well fitted for their own parts in\r\nthe social organization of the hive, these duties are quite simple,\r\nand very different from the duties of the workers; and as these latter\r\ndo not normally have descendants, and as they never under any\r\ncircumstances have female descendants, all the workers are the\r\ndescendants of queens and not of workers.\r\n\r\n\"Their wonderful and admirable fitness for their own most necessary\r\npart in the economy of the hive must, therefore, be inherited from\r\nparents who have never been exposed to those conditions to which the\r\nworkers are adapted; and this adaptation can not be due to the\r\ninheritance of the effect of these conditions, nor can we believe that\r\nthey are inherited from some remote time, when the workers were\r\nperfect females or when the queens were also workers; for the sterile\r\nworkers of allied species differ among themselves, thus proving that\r\nthey have undergone modification since they became sterile.\r\n\r\n\"Here we have a most complicated and perfect adjustment of marvelous\r\nefficacy to external conditions which are of such a character as to\r\nprove that the inheritance of the effect of these conditions has had\r\nno part in the production of the adaptation.\"\r\n\r\nHis views of bird migration, based on the matter of ovulation and not\r\non food supply, are extremely interesting. He says: \"As their eggs are\r\nvery large and heavy, a high birth rate is incompatible with flight,\r\nand the preservation of each species imperatively demands that every\r\negg shall be cared for with increasing solicitude; for while in other\r\nanimals increased danger to eggs or young may be met and compensated\r\nby an increase in the birth rate, the birth rate of birds can not be\r\nmuch increased without a corresponding restriction of the power of\r\nflight. Every one knows how quickly birds may be exterminated by the\r\ndestruction of their eggs or young, and the low birth rate of all\r\nbirds of powerful flight is a sufficient reason for migration, for at\r\nthe same time that their fitness for flight limits the birth rate, it\r\npermits them to seek nesting places beyond the reach of their\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\nHis critical estimate of Huxley is tersely presented. He says: \"His\r\nevolution is not a system of philosophy, but part of the system of\r\nscience. It deals with history--with the phenomenal world--and not\r\nwith the question what may or may not lie behind it.\r\n\r\n\"The cultivation of natural science in this historical field and the\r\ndiscovery that the present order of living things, including\r\nconscious, thinking, ethical man, has followed after an older and\r\nsimpler state of Nature, is not 'philosophy' but science. It involves\r\nno more belief in the teachings of any system of philosophy than does\r\nthe knowledge that we are the children of our parents and the parents\r\nof our children; but it is what Huxley means by 'evolution.'\"\r\n\r\nDr. Brooks credits Galton with employing simple terms to express new\r\nand abstruse truths, and we trust those who are continually wrestling\r\nwith the dead languages to pick out new and distracting words to\r\nexpress their conceptions will profit by Galton's method.\r\n\r\nThe lecture on Natural Selection and the antiquity of life is replete\r\nwith original and pregnant suggestions based upon the results of his\r\nown profound investigations on pelagic life. Here again only ample\r\nquotations from his pages would convey an adequate idea of their value\r\nand importance. In his chapter on Louis Agassiz and George Berkeley he\r\ngives this just tribute to Agassiz:\r\n\r\n\"The writer was a man of transcendent genius for scientific discovery,\r\nwith intense earnestness and enthusiasm for the pursuit of truth, and\r\nrare eloquence and literary skill. If any man was devoted to the cause\r\nof truth and determined to accept it, whatever it might prove to be,\r\nthat man was Agassiz; for while his impulses were notably devout and\r\nreverential, he proved, on many occasions, that he was fearless and\r\nindependent in the search for truth. It is no disparagement to\r\nBuckland and Bell and Chalmers and the other authors of the\r\nBridgewater Treatises to assert that Agassiz far surpassed them all in\r\nacquaintance with the methods which lead to success in the\r\ninterpretation of Nature, and in ability to treat the problems of\r\nnatural theology from the standpoint of the zoölogist.\"\r\n\r\nHe dedicates his book to Bishop Berkeley, and throughout the lectures\r\nhis references indicate a thorough acquaintance with the writings of\r\nthis eminent scholar.\r\n\r\nPaley's old watch comes in for renewed consideration, and one wonders\r\nif the mainspring of this device will ever be broken. His apt\r\nreferences to classical authors indicate wide and judicious reading.\r\nThe book is overburdened with thought and clear, concise reasoning,\r\nand his final advice should be followed when he urges his readers to\r\ndo double duty by reading the book again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the April number (1898) of this magazine we had occasion to review\r\nthe first two volumes of this work.[W] A perusal of the third volume\r\ndoes not permit us to modify the expressions and criticisms there\r\nmade. We then said the work is \"a compact storehouse of facts, a\r\nveritable ethnological museum, and this feature alone renders the book\r\nindispensable to American students.\" The author \"shows no evidence of\r\never having seen the magnificent series of volumes issued by the\r\nUnited States Bureau of Ethnology.\" \"The author in several instances\r\nconfounds Japan and China.\" \"His treatment of the African races is by\r\nfar the most exhaustive.\" These extracts will apply most particularly\r\nto the present volume. The negro races of the interior of Africa and\r\nthose of West Africa, as well as the cultured races of that continent,\r\nare exhaustively treated. In that portion treating of the history of\r\nthe civilization of eastern Asia the Japanese and Chinese are\r\nconsidered together and many mistakes in generalization follow as a\r\nresult of this confounding. Long before we get to this portion of the\r\nwork an illustration is given of Japanese agricultural instruments, in\r\nwhich only one plow of the many types in Japan is presented, and this\r\nis evidently taken from a model. Not only has he confounded the\r\nJapanese with the Chinese, but the southern Malays are brought in when\r\nhe speaks of the Malay and Japanese love of the cockfight--a practice\r\nwhich is unknown in Japan. He refers to the Japanese latrine as being\r\nbuilt over running water, whereas the record of this custom is found\r\nonly in an ancient Japanese classic of the seventh century. He is in\r\nerror in stating that the stage is essentially the same in China and\r\nJapan. His description of the music of Japan applies to China only.\r\nThe statements that pearls play a large part in the ornaments of the\r\nJapanese, that the fireproof buildings are of stone, that the\r\nJapanese tobacco is moistened with opium, that the Japanese street\r\ndress is full of color, are all erroneous. His description of the sash\r\nworn by men is the description of the woman's sash. He says \"the\r\nJapanese currency before the change to dollars and cents was like that\r\nof the Chinese.\" Had he consulted Snowden's description of ancient and\r\nmodern coins, etc., he would have found this correct statement in\r\nregard to Japanese coins: \"In their shape, composition, and relation\r\nto each other they present some striking features which set them apart\r\nfrom every other system of coinage in the world.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote W: The History of Mankind. By Prof. Friedrich Ratzal. The\r\nMacmillan Company. Vol. III, pp. 599.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are badly distributed. Through pages of description\r\nof the Japanese and Koreans, in which little is said about the\r\nKoreans, are scattered illustrations of the inhabitants of Yeso--the\r\nAinu. The illustration of Japanese table furniture depicts only\r\nutensils for smoking and wine-drinking, and some of these are\r\nerroneously labeled, as are those of certain Chinese utensils.\r\n\r\nWe trust that the Asiatic portion of this valuable work will be\r\nwritten over again, and in doing it the author will realize that he is\r\ndealing with four or five hundred million people widely separated in\r\nlanguage, modes of writing, customs, and manners; that he will\r\nconsider the Ainu, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thibetan, and\r\nIndo-Chinese with the same thoroughness that he has given to the\r\nseparate groups of the African continent; that he will draw his\r\ninformation from modern sources and collections properly labeled and\r\nup to date.\r\n\r\nEven with the defects pointed out the work will prove of great value\r\nto the American student, as it brings before him the richness of the\r\nethnological museums of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTICES.\r\n\r\n_The Development of English Thought_[X] is \"an attempt to present a\r\ntheory of history through concrete illustrations.\" The book does not\r\ndeal with the facts of history--a knowledge of these is assumed--it\r\nthrows into relief certain salient features of each epoch which were\r\ninstrumental in forwarding the social consciousness. It may, indeed,\r\nbe called a philosophy of economics. It has a theory to propound:\r\nSurvival is determined and progress created by a struggle for the\r\ngoods for which men strive, or the means by which they may avert evil.\r\nThese goods change, together with the environment dependent on them.\r\nHence arise new activities; the race is modified, new modes of thought\r\ncome forward, and finally the characteristics of the civilization are\r\nreconstructed. These changes are subject to a definite law of\r\nevolution, repeated in each new environment. England has been chosen\r\nfor this economic interpretation of history; because of its insular\r\nposition, its development has been more normal and indigenous, less\r\nsubject to foreign influences since the Reformation, than any\r\ncontinental country. An explanation of the psychological theory\r\nunderlying the book serves as general introduction. The antecedents of\r\nEnglish thought are found among the early Germans, and the Early\r\nChurch. The fifteenth century, with its inventions and discoveries,\r\nrevolutionized men's ways of living and thinking. Then the Calvinists\r\nand Puritans imposed their standards of good and evil. These are\r\nfollowed by the great English thinkers: Locke, who marks the beginning\r\nof Deism in England; Mandeville, Hume, and Smith, developing the\r\neconomic side; Whitefield and Wesley leading the religious revival.\r\nLater on, Malthus, Ricardo, and Mill formulated the Economic\r\nPhilosophy, whereas Darwin, the first of the biologists, imposed\r\nbiologic habits of thought on economic inquiry. The concluding\r\nchapter, while cautious in the discussion of current problems,\r\nattempts, assisted by the lessons of the past, to indicate the\r\nprobable future movement of thought, springing out of present economic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote X: The Development of English Thought. A Study in the\r\nEconomic Interpretation of History. By Simon N. Patten, Ph. D. New\r\nYork: The Macmillan Company. 1899. $3.]\r\n\r\nMr. _Wilbur S. Jackman_ has sought in preparing his manual of _Nature\r\nStudy for Grammar Grades_,[Y] to propose a few of such problems\r\narising in a thoughtful study of Nature as are within the\r\ncomprehension of grammar-school pupils, and to offer suggestions\r\ndesigned to lead to their solution. Directions may perhaps be given by\r\nthe teacher--that is, by some teachers, but very few--but even if he\r\nknows how, it is hardly possible for him to make them as systematic to\r\nso large an extent as would be required by a school of inquiring\r\npupils; and such a plan as the author offers may be accepted as a\r\nvaluable help. Take, for instance, the first lesson on the mutual\r\nrelations of plants and insects--as to plants. The student is told\r\nwhat equipment to take, what places to visit; is reminded of seven\r\nkinds of evidence in the shape of galls, stings, eaten leaves, etc.,\r\nto be considered; and is given a list of queries to be recollected in\r\nstudying the phenomena, in their general aspect, as to the benefit or\r\ninjury received by the plant from insects, the attractions it offers,\r\nand the defenses it possesses, with \"number work\" relating to the\r\nextent of the depredations, and methods of representing the results of\r\nthe study in picture. The book contains forty-five such lessons on\r\ndifferent aspects of Nature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Y: Nature Study for Grammar Grades. A Manual for the\r\nGuidance of Pupils below the High School in the Study of Nature. By\r\nWilbur S. Jackman. Danville, Ill.: The Illinois Printing Company. Pp.\r\n407.]\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of his book on _Fertilizers_[Z] it has been the aim\r\nof Mr. _Voorhees_ to point out the underlying principles and to\r\ndiscuss, in the light of our present knowledge of the subject, some of\r\nthe important problems connected with the use of fertilizing\r\nmaterials. While the author recognizes the lack of definite knowledge\r\non many vital points, he considers it desirable, when the\r\ninvestigations of the experiment stations are becoming so important\r\nand they are so well prepared to study the fundamental principles of\r\nplant nutrition, for the practical man to have a clear understanding\r\nof what is now known. The book treats of the natural fertility of the\r\nsoil and the sources of the loss of the elements of fertility, the\r\nfunctions of manure and fertilizers and the need of artificial ones,\r\nthe different classes of fertilizers, the chemical analysis of them,\r\nand the methods of using them with their special application to\r\nvarious crops.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Z: Fertilizers.

Price, $1.]\r\n\r\nWe have received, with only a short interval between them, the first\r\nvolume of a third edition and the fourth or last volume of the second\r\nedition of _Alfred H. Allen's Commercial Organic Analysis_.[AA] The\r\nformer volume is first to reach us. It is a high testimony to the\r\nvalue of the work in itself that the publication of a rival issue of\r\nthe edition of 1885 had been begun by another house, although its age,\r\nas suggested by the date, would indicate that it had much need of\r\nrevision. During the thirteen years since the publication of this\r\nedition later research has thrown new light on many features of the\r\nscience and processes, and has corrected many of the old conceptions,\r\nand the author's views on some points have changed in the light of the\r\nmore recent results, so that the preparation of a new edition had\r\nbecome necessary. Mr. Allen has found it now impossible for him to\r\nundertake the continuous labor which would be imposed by such a task,\r\nand the work of revision has been undertaken by Henry Leffmann, of\r\nPhiladelphia. For this new edition Mr. Allen has furnished material\r\non the subjects of the Kjeldahl process, proteids of wheat flour,\r\nvinegar, brewing sugars, malt substitutes, hop substitutes, and\r\nsecondary constituents in spirits. Information has been added by the\r\nAmerican reviser, partly from suggestions by Mr. Allen on the subjects\r\nof specific gravity, formaldehyde, vinegar, methyl, alcohol, acetone,\r\nfusel oil, argol, starch, glucose, invert sugar, lactose, and wine,\r\nand brief notes on other topics. Processes of the American Association\r\nof Official Agricultural Chemists have been reprinted. The revision of\r\nVol. II is well in hand, and will be much more extensive than that of\r\nVol I.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AA: Commercial Organic Analysis.

Price, $4.50.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the revision of the second edition has extended\r\nover fourteen years, and is only just completed with the fourth\r\nvolume, which appears a few weeks later than the volume noticed above.\r\nThe earlier volumes have been long out of print, and are destined, of\r\ncourse, to be supplanted by those of the new revision. The present\r\nfourth volume, being newer and of the present date, will serve as the\r\nlatest till the last volume of the new revision is reached; and,\r\nbesides, the author hopes to publish an appendix to each volume,\r\ncontaining the more important of the later results. The meaning of the\r\nterm Commercial Analysis has been somewhat extended, and matter has\r\nbeen included that in closest strictness does not belong under it, it\r\nbeing thought better, the author says, to include all facts possessing\r\nan analytical or practical interest to him, in the belief that what he\r\nfinds useful himself will be of value to others.\r\n\r\nIn _The Porto Rico of To-day_[AB] a traveler's view of that\r\ninteresting island and its people is presented by Mr. _A. G.\r\nRobinson_, who went there and remained during August, September, and\r\nOctober, 1898, as correspondent of the New York Evening Post. While\r\nthe book can not be regarded, as it does not profess and is not\r\nintended to be, as a source of geographical or statistical\r\ninformation, it admirably fulfills the design of the author to present\r\na picture of the people and of the country as he saw them; and it is a\r\nvery living picture too. He looked with a sharp eye, and has recorded\r\nwhat he saw in graphic style. In the author's story of his early days\r\nof the island we are made acquainted with the various names it has\r\nhad, of which Porto Rico, or Puerto Rico, is only the latest. The\r\noldest of the European names appears to have been Buriquién, in some\r\none of the dozen or more spellings it has had, one of them being Bo.\r\nIt has also been called La Isla de Carib, San Juan Bautista, etc.\r\nAfter the account of the author's first general impressions and\r\nexperiences he describes the city of Ponce, his visit to a coffee\r\ndistrict, a number of typical towns and villages, the journey from\r\nPonce to San Juan, the highways, railways--of which there are one\r\nhundred and forty-three miles in operation and one hundred and\r\nseventy-five miles under construction--and a fairly effective\r\ntelegraph system, views of the industrial possibilities and commerce\r\nof the island, with some experiences of military campaigning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AB: The Porto Rico of To-day. Pen Pictures of the People and\r\nthe Country. By Albert Gardner Robinson. New York: Charles Scribner's\r\nSons. Pp. 240, with maps. Price, $1.50.]\r\n\r\nThe publication of the revision which Mr. _Herbert Spencer_ is making\r\nof his Synthetic Philosophy in order to incorporate in it as far as\r\nmay be the results of more recent advances begins with the first\r\nvolume of _The Principles of Biology_.[AC] The advance during the last\r\ngeneration, Mr. Spencer thinks, has been more rapid in the direction\r\nof this science than any other, and though the hope of bringing a work\r\non biology at large up to date could not be rationally entertained at\r\nthe author's age and under the existing conditions of his physical\r\nstrength, a similar service to a work on the principles of the science\r\ndid not seem impossible. Numerous additions have been needful. What\r\nwas originally said about vital changes of matter is supplemented by a\r\nchapter on Metabolism. A chapter is added on The Dynamic Element in\r\nLife. The insertion of some pages on Structure fills a gap in\r\npreceding editions. The revelations of the microscope on cell life and\r\nmultiplication are set forth. A supplementary chapter on Genesis,\r\nHeredity, and Variation gives the results of further evidence and\r\nfurther thought in that line, qualifying and developing certain views\r\nenunciated in the first edition. Various modern ideas are considered\r\nunder the title Recent Criticisms and Hypotheses. The chapter on The\r\nArguments from Embryology has been largely rewritten. Smaller\r\nadditions appear in the form of new sections incorporated in\r\npre-existing chapters. The assistance needed in the work of revision\r\nhas been given by Prof. W. H. Perkin in Organic Chemistry and its\r\nderived subjects; Prof. A. G. Tansley in Plant Morphology and\r\nPhysiology; Prof. E. W. MacBride and Mr. J. T. Cunningham in Animal\r\nMorphology; and Mr. W. B. Hardy in Animal Physiology. In all sections\r\nnot marked as new the author desires it to be understood that the\r\nessential ideas set forth are the same as they were in the original\r\nedition of 1864.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AC: The Principles of Biology. By Herbert Spencer. In Two\r\nVolumes. Vol. I. Revised and enlarged edition. New York: D. Appleton\r\nand Company. Pp. 706. Price, $2.]\r\n\r\nProf. _Silas W. Holman_ attempts the presentation, in _Matter, Energy,\r\nForce, and Work_,[AD] of some of the fundamental ideas and definitions\r\nof physics in a plain and logical manner. His purpose is not to set\r\nforth the experimental side of the subject or to describe phenomena or\r\nlaws. He rather assumes a slight knowledge of these, and proceeds to\r\ndevelop the concept and definitions. The author regards a clearer\r\nthinking on these subjects as of special importance to engineers and\r\nmembers of the other technical professions, because correct views upon\r\nthem have become essential in those professions through the progress\r\nof the applications of science to the industrial arts. These\r\napplications are likewise of considerable interest to the untechnical\r\nmembers of the community. Professor Holman has composed his book with\r\nthe principle of presenting the subject of physics in logical\r\nsequence, and has divided it into two parts, the first of which\r\ncontains the matter immediately proper to the subject, with\r\ndiscussions of substance or matter, motion; energy and its forms;\r\nforce; kinetic energy, force-measurements, work, potential energy, and\r\nmatter again, as distinguished from substance. The second part\r\ncomprises summaries of the chief theories of the nature of matter,\r\nforce, and energy, including the kinetic theory of gases, Le Sage's\r\ntheory of gravitation, the vortex-atom theory, and a discussion of the\r\nnature of energy and matter, with observations on chemical energy and\r\nthe ether.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AD: Matter, Energy, Force, and Work. A Plain Presentation of\r\nFundamental Physical Concepts, and of the Vortex-Atom and other\r\nTheories. By Silas W. Holman. New York: The Macmillan Company. Pp.\r\n257. Price, $2.50.]\r\n\r\nThe _Short Course in Music_, prepared for use in schools where a\r\ncomplete course is not thought necessary, by _F. H. Ripley_ and\r\n_Thomas Tappen_, is embraced in two books, of which we notice the\r\nsecond (American Book Company). Familiar songs are made the basis of\r\ninstruction, some of those which appear as melodies in Book One being\r\nrepeated here in full score. All other material has been prepared\r\nespecially for this book. The music and directions are adapted equally\r\nfor unchanged and changed voices. Voice training and the elements of\r\nphrasing and expression are furnished in a group of _solfeggios_ at\r\nthe close of the book. Theory is given in condensed form, but one\r\nthat, it is claimed, embraces all the essential elements of vocal\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nMr. _J. E. Marr_ has prepared his exposition of _The Principles of\r\nStratigraphical Geology_ (Cambridge University Press; The Macmillan\r\nCompany, New York, $1.60), under the belief that an idea of the\r\nsubject can be obtained most satisfactorily if a large number of the\r\ndetails connected with the study of the stratified rocks are omitted.\r\nHe has accordingly given very brief accounts of the strata of the\r\ndifferent systems, paying more attention to the bearings of the facts\r\nthan to their enumeration. The history of the earth is presented as a\r\nconnected one, in which one period is linked on to the next, every\r\nevent that occurs introducing a new complication into the conditions,\r\nwhich are consequently never quite the same--the changes showing an\r\nadvance from the simple to the more complex. The study proves that an\r\nenormous period elapsed subsequent to the formation of the earth and\r\nprevious to the deposition of the stratified rocks, of which we have\r\nonly the slightest, if any, knowledge. The stratigraphical geologist\r\nhas to establish the order of succession of the strata for the\r\nchronology, and to ascertain as far as he can the conditions existing\r\nduring the deposition of the several strata or groups of strata. After\r\nan account of the growth and progress of stratigraphical geology, the\r\nnature of the stratified rocks and the law of superposition are\r\ndiscussed; the test of included organisms and the methods of\r\nclassification are explained, the evidences of conditions under which\r\nstrata were formed, and other theoretical points are considered, and\r\nthe several geological systems or periods are enumerated under the\r\nEnglish nomenclature. Finally, the various estimates of geological\r\ntime and the bases on which they are made are reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe American Book Company publishes as a part of the Eclectic System\r\nof Industrial Drawing an excellent manual of the _Elements of\r\nPerspective_, by _Christine Gordon Sullivan_, of the Cincinnati public\r\nschools. It consists of explicit directions and rules on the general\r\nprinciples of the art, with applications in Isometric Projection and\r\nOblique Perspective, given in concise form and simple, clear language,\r\namply illustrated, and supplemented by problems, in solving which the\r\nrules are made practical.\r\n\r\nA convenient manual on _Gas and Petroleum Engines_ has been prepared\r\nby _A. G. Elliott_ from the French of _Henry de Graffigny_ for\r\nWhittaker's Electro-Mechanical Series, in recognition of the interest\r\nthat has been awakened in the application of such engines to supply\r\nthe place now occupied by horses in drawing vehicles. One chapter\r\ndeals exclusively with the theory of the gas engines. Other topics\r\ntreated of are the history of the gas engine, the description of\r\nexisting gas engines, carbureted air engines, petroleum engines,\r\ngas-generating plants, engines for use with poor gases, and the\r\nmaintenance of gas and oil engines. (The Macmillan Company, 75 cents.)\r\n\r\n_Laboratory Exercises in Anatomy and Physiology_ (New York: Henry Holt\r\n& Co., 60 cents) have been prepared by _James Edward Peabody_ for\r\npractical application. The precept is emphasized that the pupil should\r\nbe led to see that most of the materials required for observation and\r\nexperiment are furnished by the organs and tissues of his own body.\r\nDirections which have been found in the author's experience necessary\r\nto guide the pupil in his observations and experiments are given at\r\nthe beginning of each topic. The questions following them contemplate\r\nthe student's seeking the facts from the material itself, and he is\r\nexpected to be trained to distinguish observed results from the\r\ninferences that may be drawn from them. Some home study is\r\ncontemplated, the results to be afterward reported in class. The book\r\nconsists almost entirely of directions for experiments, and is\r\ninterlined with blank sheets for recording observations.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Nature Studies_ (American Book Company) is intended by\r\nthe author, _Frank Owen Payne_, to assist the teacher, and by pointing\r\nout the relations, often unrecognized, between familiar phenomena and\r\nhome geography to guide the study of the class to definite and\r\npractical ends. The lessons are intended to fit the comprehension of\r\nthe youngest pupils, to promote the cultivation of habits of accurate\r\nobservation, and to stimulate a desire for more knowledge and broader\r\nviews of the world. They lead directly up to the point where the more\r\nformal study of geography from a text-book begins. The lessons may be\r\nused as reading exercises and for topical recitations, and exercises\r\nare introduced which may assist the cultivation of the power of\r\ncorrect verbal expression in the statement of facts. The exercises\r\nconcern weather, animals, physical phenomena, and objects about us,\r\nand are very various.\r\n\r\nImpressions of Medusæ have been observed on the Jurassic lithographic\r\nlimestones of Solenhofen, and some \"problematic fossils\" on the Lower\r\nCambrian rocks of Sweden have been regarded as derived from Medusæ.\r\nCertain nodules, bearing what looked like flattened-out\r\nstarfishes--\"star-cobbles\" they were called--have been found among the\r\nfossils of the Coosa Valley, Alabama. Director _Charles D. Walcott_,\r\nof the United States Geological Survey, concluded that these also\r\nrepresented Medusæ, and began an investigation of them which involved\r\na comparison with the Swedish and Bavarian specimens, and was at last\r\nenlarged so as to embrace all fossil Medusæ. His work is now\r\npublished as a separate memoir, _Fossil Medusæ_, as one of the\r\nMonographs of the United States Geological Survey (Vol. XXX). The\r\nMiddle Cambrian Medusæ are first described, and then, in order, the\r\nLower Cambrian of the United States and of Sweden and Bohemia and the\r\nJurassic of Bavaria. The text is illustrated by forty-seven excellent\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nA new edition, revised and with additions, of the _Mechanics_ and\r\n_Heat_ of _Edward L. Nichols_ and _W. S. Francis_ is published by the\r\nMacmillan Company ($1.50). The book is the first volume of the\r\nElements of Physics of the authors, which is complete in three\r\nvolumes. We find in it no explanation of the nature and extent of the\r\nrevisions and additions.\r\n\r\nThe publication of such a book as _Catering for Two_--Comfort and\r\nEconomy for small Households (G. P. Putnam's Sons, $1.25)--has been\r\nsuggested to _Alice L. James_ by the difficulty of reducing the\r\naverage rules of the cook-book to meet the wants of a family of two or\r\nthree. The work embodies the results of sixteen years' experience in\r\nlabor and study, and the author hopes that with it the way may be made\r\neasier for others whose bills of fare may be made for two. The\r\ndirections are claimed to be throughout exact and reliable, and the\r\ndishes to be nourishing, appetizing, and inexpensive. The author's\r\nplan is to take a bill of fare with a comfortable variety of dishes,\r\nand direct explicitly how each is to be prepared.\r\n\r\nThe manual on _Testing Milk and its Products_, prepared for dairy\r\nstudents, creamery and cheese factory operators, food chemists, and\r\ndairy farmers, by _E. H. Farrington_ and _F. W. Noll_, has reached a\r\nfourth edition, the first three editions having been exhausted in\r\nabout a year. The present edition has been thoroughly revised, and\r\nsuch additions have been made to it as have been necessary to bring it\r\nup to date. It has been adopted as a text-book or reference-book in\r\nthe dairy schools of twelve States of the Union and in a number of\r\nschools in Canada. (Published by the Mendota Book Company, Madison,\r\nWis. $1.)\r\n\r\n_The Silver Cross, or the Carpenter of Nazareth_ (International\r\nPublishing Company, New York), is a short story selected and\r\ntranslated from The Mysteries of the People of Eugène Sue, and\r\npublished for the sake of the illustrations it is supposed to afford\r\nof the tyranny of the ruling class and the oppression of the working\r\npeople and the poor and their suffering thereby which prevailed in the\r\ngrand days of the Roman Empire, as well as always before, and is\r\nassumed to have continued down to the present. It is the story of the\r\nlife and sufferings of Jesus of Nazareth, told in the thrilling style\r\nof the great French novelist.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\nAgricultural Experiment Stations.

The general election took\r\nplace in November of the same year, and is described in the Saturday\r\nReview as having been a warm contest, with several questions on which\r\npublic opinion was sharply divided; but \"on the whole, the women took\r\nmatters wonderfully coolly. They flocked in thousands to the public\r\nmeetings, where, by common consent, the front seats were given up to\r\nthem.\" Contrary to expectation, they displayed little emotion, and\r\neven had to be \"coached\" to make a pretense of enthusiasm. \"Polling\r\nday was awaited with dread by the electioneering agents and returning\r\nofficers, with doubt by veteran politicians, and with pleasurable\r\nexcitement by the women.\" They all voted, and \"what did it all lead\r\nto?\" \"It left things very much as they were.... Gradually but\r\nirresistibly the conviction forced itself upon the New Zealand mind\r\nthat the women knowing little and caring as little about political\r\ndetails, had voted almost always with the men of their family and\r\nclass. Sharing to the full the prejudices, hopes, and interests of\r\ntheir fathers, brothers, husbands, and lovers, they had cheerfully\r\ndoubled the voting power of these. Where, as in the case of\r\nschoolmistresses and factory girls, they had some special bond of\r\nunion other than domestic they had voted very much as schoolmasters\r\nand male trade-unionists had voted.... With one accord colonists\r\nceased to be afraid of what the suffrage might do, and began instead\r\nto complain of it for not doing more. Only here and there careful\r\nobservers note that groups of women are studying politics, and foresee\r\nthat, as years go by, these will supply a new and intelligent force\r\nwith distinct and logically reasoned aims of its own.\"\r\n\r\n=The Metric System= (a Letter to the London Times).--SIR: I see that\r\non Wednesday next, the 22d inst., the President of the Board of Trade\r\nis to receive a deputation from the Decimal Associations and others to\r\nurge on the Government, not merely the adoption of the decimal system\r\nof notation, but the compulsory application within two years of the\r\nmetric system of weights and measures in its entirety. I have been\r\nhoping to see a letter in the Times from some person of importance\r\ncalling attention to this deputation. I fervently trusted I should\r\nnotice one from your correspondent, Mr. Herbert Spencer, who, a year\r\nor so back, contributed a series of thoroughly well-thought-out and\r\nlogical articles, exposing the fallacy of the metric system; but if\r\nany such letter has appeared I have, unfortunately, missed it. I\r\nbelieve this agitation to be largely due to scientific professors who\r\nhave been brought up on foreign books, and have found it too much\r\ntrouble to convert foreign measurements into English; further, due to\r\nthe promptings of a number of foreign merchants, forming (happily, or\r\nunhappily) now so large a portion of our traders-men who, also, do not\r\nwish to take the trouble of converting foreign weights and measures\r\ninto English. As regards the suggestion, made time after time, that\r\nthe metric system is one giving the greatest simplicity to\r\ncalculations, I say unhesitatingly, from very considerable experience,\r\nthat it is one absolutely subversive of mental arithmetic, and I\r\nappeal to anybody who has ever had the misfortune to wait at the\r\n_guichet_ of a French railway station while the clerk inside has been\r\ncalculating the total amount to be paid for two first-class and one\r\nsecond-class from \"A\" to \"B\" with a piece of chalk, or pencil and\r\npaper, to compare the speed and the certainty of this process with the\r\nanswer that he would get at Euston, or at any such station in Great\r\nBritain, and say which system shows by results the advantages in point\r\nof time and in accuracy. The French themselves, as has been pointed\r\nout on more than one occasion, find the metric system too irksome, and\r\nthey evade it. According to the metric system, one of its great merits\r\nis that you can state every required quantity by multiples or\r\nsubmultiples of ten--metre, 1; decimetre, 0.1; centimetre, 0.01;\r\nmillimetre, 0.001. But no Frenchman thinks of expressing himself in\r\nthis way. Instead of 0.01, he says cm. 1. For a millimetre, he says\r\nmm. 1. When he comes to large weights, does he not commonly abjure the\r\n1,000 kilos and write one tonne? When he comes to domestic weights the\r\nkilogramme is found too large; the half of this, the practical\r\nequivalent of the pound, is wanted. He ought to write 500 grammes. He\r\ndoes not. He abjures his decimals, and writes one half kilo. But I\r\nfeel I must not take up your space by multiplying instances, so well\r\nknown to many who have studied the subject, of the unbearable burden\r\nof the decimal _plus_ metrical system compulsorily carried out. I well\r\nknow the value of decimals, and the indispensable need of their use in\r\nmany circumstances; but I object to being compelled to use them when\r\nthey are not needed and are in the way. I find it easier to state\r\nseven eighths, and to deal with it mentally, than to put it into the\r\nform of .875. I do not wish to be restricted by law in the use of my\r\ntools. What would be thought of the law which compelled a shipwright\r\non all occasions to use a chisel, and never to employ the adze. I,\r\nwith, I believe, every upholder of English weights and measures, and\r\nof the use of fractions, am quite willing that the metric system\r\nshould be made legal in its entirety throughout Great Britain; but we\r\nare not willing that the useful weights and measures which we can\r\nemploy with so great facility and accuracy should be made illegal.\r\nLet the two exist together, and experience will prove which is the one\r\npreferred by the community. I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                 FREDERICK BRAMWELL.\r\n                            5 GREAT GEORGE STREET, WESTMINSTER, S. W.,\r\n  _March 18, 1899_.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Very probably the old stalking-horses will be trotted out on\r\nWednesday, and the President of the Board of Trade will be told of the\r\nconfusion created by the existence of mere local weights and measures.\r\nI believe that if those who cite these anomalies were asked to give\r\ninstances at various dates it would be found that these local weights\r\nand measures were dying out. In any event they are illegal, and are\r\nnot obligatory upon anybody. Every man can claim to deal according to\r\nthe standards of length, of weights, and of capacity. Most certainly\r\nthe introduction of the metric system would largely add to the use of\r\nillegal weights and measures, not only locally, but generally. If the\r\ninquiry were made in France, even no farther off than Boulogne, it\r\nwould be found that, in the markets there, dealings are frequently\r\ncarried out on a local system unconnected with the metric.--F. B.\r\n\r\n=Variations in African Religious Ideas.=--Miss Kingsley observes, in\r\nher West African Studies, that when you are traveling from district to\r\ndistrict you can not fail to be struck by the difference in character\r\nof the native religions you are studying, and that no wandering\r\nstudent of the subject in western Africa can avoid recognizing the\r\nexistence of at least four distinct forms of development of the fetich\r\nidea. They have every one of them the same underlying idea, and yet\r\nthey differ. \"And I believe,\" Miss Kingsley says, \"much of the\r\nconfusion which is supposed to exist in African religious ideas is a\r\nconfusion only existing in the minds of cabinet ethnologists from a\r\nwant of recognition of the fact of the existence of these schools. For\r\nexample, suppose you take a few facts from Ellis and a few from\r\nBastian and mix, and call the mixture West African religion. You do\r\nmuch the same sort of thing as if you took bits from Mr. Spurgeon's\r\nworks and from those of some eminent Jesuit and of a sound Greek\r\nchurchman and mixed them, and labeled it European religion. The bits\r\nwould be all right by themselves, but the mixture would be a quaint\r\naffair.\" Of the four main schools of fetich predicated by Miss\r\nKingsley, the Tshi and Ewe school (Ellis's school) is mainly concerned\r\nwith the preservation of life; the Calabar school with attempting to\r\nenable the soul successfully to pass through death; the Mpongwe school\r\nwith the attainment of material prosperity; and the school of Nkissi\r\nwith the worship of the mystery of the power of evil.\r\n\r\n=A Natural History Society as a School.=--Among the agencies employed\r\nby the Boston Society of Natural History for making itself a vehicle\r\nof instruction to the public has been the employment of an educated\r\nman and teacher as guide to the museum, who should also give lectures\r\nthere. The salary of this officer has heretofore been provided by the\r\nbounty of Miss Harriet E. Freeman, but she has been obliged to\r\ndiscontinue her contribution, and the curator is now seeking other\r\nmeans of maintaining a suitably qualified assistant. The \"guide,\" Mr.\r\nA. W. Grabau, delivered a course of lectures in April and May, 1897,\r\non \"The Surface of the Earth: Its Rocks, Soil, and Scenery,\" in which\r\nspecial attention was given to the scenery in New England; and,\r\nwhenever it was practicable, excursions were made to localities which\r\ncould be used as illustrations. A similar course, delivered in 1896,\r\nresulted in the formation during the summer of the same year of a\r\nclass of thirty persons, summer residents of Kennebunkport, Maine, who\r\nwere under Mr. Grabau's daily instruction for two weeks. The awakening\r\nof interest in local scenery further led to his giving lectures in\r\nBelmont and Arlington, and he thereby became instrumental in a\r\nmovement intended to preserve the local frontal bowlder moraine on\r\nArlington Heights--a valuable geological movement. A course of\r\nlectures on the Animals of the Shores of New England was given by Mr.\r\nGrabau to a class of from forty to seventy-five persons, in the\r\nTeachers' School of Science, with excursions on Wednesday and Saturday\r\nafternoons. In a similar fall course attention was given specially to\r\nthe study of animals in their various habitats. A course by Mr.\r\nGrabau on the use of the microscope and the preparation of specimens\r\nwas followed by ten days' laboratory work in Limekilns Bay, Maine. One\r\nof the results of a winter course on zoölogy, to a class of twenty\r\nteachers, was the formation of the Hale House Natural History Club, in\r\nconnection with which field meetings are held, classes for children\r\nare formed, and papers upon elementary subjects are read and\r\ndiscussed. Other courses of lectures are mentioned in the report of\r\nthe curator of the society--the field lessons in geology, by Professor\r\nBarton, with a winter course in historical geology; the course of Dr.\r\nR. W. Greenleaf, on the elementary structure and function of the parts\r\nof flowering plants; the course of the curator (Alpheus Hyatt), on\r\nelementary zoölogy; and the lectures on geography, by Prof. W. M.\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\n=Glacier Water.=--An analysis of two samples of water from the\r\nIllecilliwaet Glacier, in British Columbia, was recently made by F. T.\r\nShutt and A. T. Charron. The water was collected a few feet from the\r\nglacier's irregular face, about a mile and a half from the glacier\r\nstation on the Canadian Pacific Railway. The following is abstracted\r\nfrom an account in the Chemical News:\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n                                    |  No. 1.   |  No. 2.\r\n                                    +-----------+-----------\r\n                                    |  Parts per million.\r\n  ----------------------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Free ammonia                      |   0.018   |   0.018\r\n  Albuminoid ammonia                |   0.027   |   0.037\r\n  Nitrogen as nitrates and nitrites |   0.0246  |   0.0442\r\n  Oxygen absorbed in fifteen minutes|   0.0396  |   0.0672\r\n  Oxygen absorbed in four hours     |   0.1056  |   0.1744\r\n  Chlorine                          |   0.10    |   0.10\r\n  Total solids at 105° C.           |  30.8     |  12.0\r\n  Solids after ignition             |  30.8     |   8.0\r\n  Loss on ignition                  |   None.   |   4.0\r\n  Phosphates                        |   None.   |   None.\r\n  ----------------------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nThe authors go on to say: \"From the above data we may unhesitatingly\r\nconclude that the glacier water is one of great organic purity. The\r\nsamples are not identical, due no doubt to the fact that they were\r\ncollected twelve days apart, and probably from different parts of the\r\nfoot of the glacier. Both analyses, however, show that, judged by the\r\nstandards used in the diagnosis of ordinary potable waters, it is a\r\nwater possessing a high degree of purity, and one perfectly wholesome\r\nand eminently suited for drinking and household purposes. As received,\r\nboth samples were quite murky, almost milky, in appearance. On\r\nallowing them to stand, perfect subsidence took place, leaving the\r\nsupernatant water colorless and brilliant. A microscopic examination\r\nof the sediment showed it to consist of very fine rock matter, chiefly\r\nfragments of quartzite.\r\n\r\n=Protection of Plants and Birds in France and Italy.=--Organized\r\nefforts for the protection of native plants and birds from further\r\ndestruction are multiplying in Europe. Botanical stations for Alpine\r\nplants have been established at several places in France and\r\nSwitzerland, and now Italy has come into line with the association\r\n_Pro Mortibus_, which, founded in July, 1897, has already more than\r\nfive hundred adherents. Italy is probably the country where work of\r\nthis kind is most needed, for nowhere else is the destruction,\r\nparticularly of birds, so systematically, persistently, and\r\nindustriously carried on. _Pro Mortibus_ will also interest itself in\r\nthe preservation and replantation of the forests. Among other efforts\r\nlooking in a similar direction, M. J. Corcelli tells in _La Nature_ of\r\nthe establishment of shelters in connection with the schools in Saxony\r\nwhere birds are fed in the winter, and of lessons given to the\r\nchildren inculcating regard for them. A great deal has been\r\naccomplished in France without much noise in rewooding the devastated\r\nslopes of the mountains and erecting efficient safeguards against\r\nravage by torrents--largely by restraining the torrents at their\r\nsources; and the Alpine forests of the country, M. Corcelli says, \"are\r\nagain rising from their ashes.\" Reserves of Alpine plants have been\r\nestablished by the Belfort section of the French Alpine Club on the\r\n_Ballon_ of Alsace; the central section is creating an extensive\r\nbotanical garden in the Vosges, to serve as a place of refuge and\r\npropagation and multiplication of species threatened with extinction.\r\nThe city of Annecy, in Savoy, has recently voted the money required\r\nfor establishing a similar garden on the verdant ridges of the Semnoz.\r\nTwo local societies in Italy are engaged in a similar work, one of\r\nwhich has established the garden museum Chamousia on the slopes of the\r\nSaint Bernard, where plants from the Pyrenees and the Himalaya are\r\nalso collected. Switzerland is not behind either of these countries in\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\n=Tortoise Shell.=--The following interesting account of the\r\ntortoise-shell industry is taken from Nature: The tortoise shell of\r\ncommerce is obtained from the horny superficial plates overlying the\r\nbony case of the great majority of tortoises and turtles. Turtles\r\ndiffer from tortoises in the heart-shaped form of the upper half of\r\nthe shell, and the conversion of the limbs into paddles adapted for\r\nswimming. The upper part of the shell carries a median row of five\r\nlarge superficial horny plates, flanked on either side by a row of\r\nfour or five still larger flat plates; these thirteen or fifteen large\r\nplates affording some of the most valuable commercial tortoise shell\r\nin the particular species whose shell is in most demand. On the front\r\nand hind edges of the upper bony shell and the portion connecting the\r\nlatter with the plastron, or lower shell, are a series of smaller\r\nhorny plates, generally twenty-four in number, which are sharply bent\r\nin the middle and are known in the trade as \"hoof.\" The under surface\r\nof the shell of a turtle carries six pairs of large, more or less\r\nflat, horny plates, for which the trade term, derived from their\r\nuniform color, is \"yellow belly.\" In value they sometimes exceed all\r\nbut the very finest of the large upper plates, generally known simply\r\nas \"shell.\" Of the host of land and fresh-water tortoises, most of\r\nwhich are of comparatively small size, the horny plates (which, by the\r\nway, are altogether wanting in the so-called soft tortoises of\r\ntropical rivers), on account of their thinness and opacity, are now of\r\nno commercial value, at least in England. Moreover, it is by no means\r\nall species of marine turtles which yield commercial tortoise shell.\r\nOf these marine turtles, exclusive of the great leathery turtle, there\r\nare three well-marked and perfectly distinct types, severally\r\nrepresented by the green or edible turtle, the hawksbill, and the\r\nloggerhead. The hawksbill furnishes the most valuable shell. The\r\nlargest and best plates, which are in the middle of the back, are\r\nabout a quarter of an inch thick in the center, and measure about\r\nthirteen by eight inches, their weight being from about half a pound\r\neach to as much as one pound. The length of the carapace (the upper\r\nshell) in the hawksbill is about forty-two inches. It is found in all\r\ntropical and subtropical seas. From a dead turtle the plates of\r\ntortoise shell can be readily detached by beating. The highest price\r\nrealized during 1898 in the London market was about 112_s._ 6_d._\r\n(about $28) a pound for the very best selected shell. It is stated\r\nthat 76,760 pounds of hawksbill shell were sold in London in 1898. The\r\nshell is very readily workable, being made partially plastic by\r\nimmersion in hot water.\r\n\r\n=Poison in Wild Cherry Leaves.=--Instances having been brought to the\r\nnotice of the directory of the New Hampshire College Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station of cattle presumably fatally poisoned by prussic\r\nacid from eating wild cherry leaves, the subject has been investigated\r\nby Fred W. Morse and Charles D. Howard. Five species of wild cherry\r\ngrow in New Hampshire, of which the red cherry and the horse plum are\r\nnot regarded as dangerous, and the dwarf cherry has not been examined,\r\nbut is strongly suspected. The wild black cherry is the most noxious\r\nspecies, and the chokecherry is not far behind it. The poisonous\r\nprinciple in these cherries is hydrocyanic or prussic acid, which,\r\nhowever, does not exist in the leaves as such, but is derived from the\r\namygdalin they contain. The popular opinion that only the wilted\r\nleaves are specially dangerous is not borne out. The authors found\r\nboth wilted and fresh leaves poisonous, and the dried leaves worthy to\r\nbe regarded with suspicion. Vigorous, succulent leaves from young\r\nshoots, which are the ones most likely to be eaten by cattle, are far\r\nmore poisonous than the leaves from a mature tree or stunted shrub.\r\nThe largest amounts of prussic acid were derived from leaves wilted in\r\nbright sunlight to about seventy-five per cent their original weight,\r\nor till they began to appear slightly limp and lose their gloss.\r\nLeaves wilted in the dark were much less dangerous.\r\n\r\n=Dr. Brinton's Contributions to American Linguistics.=--At the\r\nsuggestion of the late James Constantine Pilling, Dr. D. G. Brinton\r\nhas prepared an analytical survey of his contributions in the field of\r\nAmerican linguistics, which have now extended over forty years. The\r\nlist includes seventy-one titles of books and papers, of which sixteen\r\nare classed as general articles and works. The first four of these are\r\noccupied with the inquiry whether the native American languages, as a\r\ngroup, have peculiar morphological traits that justify their\r\nclassification as one of the great divisions of human speech. Dr.\r\nBrinton finds a feature--incorporation--which, under the form\r\npolysynthesis, is present in a marked degree in nearly all of them.\r\nAnother paper shows that the various alleged affiliations between\r\nAmerican and Asiatic tongues are wholly unfounded, and another pleads\r\nfor more attention to American languages. A volume of nearly four\r\nhundred pages--The American Race--was the first attempt at a\r\nsystematic classification of all the tribes of North, Central, and\r\nSouth America on the basis of language. It defines seventy-nine\r\nlinguistic stocks in North America and sixty-one in South America,\r\npertaining to nearly sixteen hundred tribes. Other volumes in the list\r\ninclude writings, preferably on secular subjects, by natives in their\r\nown languages. One contains a list of native American authors, and\r\nnotices some of their works. Another vindicates the claim of native\r\nAmerican poetry to recognition. These works were followed by the\r\nLibrary of Aboriginal American Literature, of which eight considerable\r\nvolumes were published, each containing a work wholly of native\r\ninspiration, in a native tongue, with a translation, notes, etc.\r\nFourteen other publications relate to North American languages north\r\nof Mexico, thirty-two to Mexican and Central American languages, and\r\nten to South American and Antillean languages. Many of these articles\r\nwere collected in 1890 and published in a volume entitled Essays of an\r\nAmericanist. It was arranged in four parts, relating respectively to\r\nEthnology and Archæology, Mythology and Folklore, Graphic Systems and\r\nLiterature, and Linguistics. The value of Dr. Brinton's labors will be\r\nrealized by all persons who know how rapidly things purely native\r\nAmerican are passing away.\r\n\r\n=Metallic Alloys of Rich Colors.=--A remarkable alloy of gold\r\nseventy-eight parts and aluminum twenty-two parts, discovered by\r\nMessrs. Roberts-Austen and Hunt, has a characteristic purple color\r\nwhich can not be imitated; for if the designated proportions of the\r\nconstituents are varied from, the base is entirely changed. The\r\ncompound lacks somewhat in the qualities of resistance and\r\nmalleability. The color is abnormal in that it partakes of none of the\r\ncolor features of its constituents, as is the case in most\r\ncombinations of metals. Thus, the colors of copper alloyed with zinc\r\nor tin pass gradually from red to white, according to the proportions\r\nof the constituent metals. In the union of two metals of white or\r\nbluish-white color, like zinc, tin, silver, and aluminum, the color of\r\nthe alloys is not perceptibly different from that of the\r\ncomponents--that is, it continues white. The purple of the gold\r\naluminum alloy is not, however, the only exception to this rule.\r\nAluminum gives highly colored compounds with several other metals,\r\neven when the second metal is clearly white. In the experiments of\r\nCharles Marcot, of Geneva, in alloying aluminum with platinum,\r\npalladium, nickel, and cobalt, combination took place abruptly at red\r\nheat, with the development of an intense temperature and a partial\r\ncombination of the aluminum; and when platinum is the second metal, an\r\nexplosion is liable to occur. An alloy of seventy-two parts of\r\nplatinum and twenty-eight of aluminum had a bright golden or yellow\r\ncolor, which varied under slight changes in the proportions of the\r\nelements to violet green or coppery red. The alloy is hard and brittle\r\nand of crystalline structure. The yellow form is stable, while the\r\nother forms decompose in a short time. An alloy of seventy-two parts\r\npalladium and twenty-eight aluminum is of fine coppery rose color,\r\ncrystalline texture, hard and brittle, and suffers no change with\r\ntime. An alloy of from seventy-five to eighty parts cobalt and twenty\r\nto twenty-five aluminum is straw-yellow, inclining to brown; when just\r\nformed it is externally hard and scratches glass, but is easily broken\r\nwith a hammer, and falls to a powder in a few days. An alloy of\r\neighty-two parts nickel and eighteen aluminum has a pronounced\r\nstraw-yellow color, is as hard as tempered steel, and resists the blow\r\nof a hammer. The fracture, close-grained, is that of steel or bell\r\nmetal. It is susceptible of a fine polish, is stable, and keeps its\r\ncolor. Though interesting on account of their colors, these alloys,\r\nexcept that of nickel, are not suitable for any use.\r\n\r\n=The Chemistry of Sausages.=--The _Lancet_ is authority for the\r\nfollowing: \"The composition of the sausage is not only complex, but it\r\nis often obscure. It is supposed to be a compound of minced beef and\r\npork. Abroad, however, the sausage is compounded of a much wider range\r\nof substances. These include brains, liver, and horseflesh.\r\nOccasionally they do not contain meat at all, but only bread tinged\r\nwith red oxide of iron and mixed with a varying proportion of fat.\r\nHorseflesh is rich in glycogen, and this fact enables its presence in\r\nsausage meat to be detected with some amount of certainty. The test,\r\nwhich depends on a color reaction, with iodine has recently been more\r\ncarefully studied and with more satisfactory results, so that the\r\npresence of five per cent of horseflesh can be detected. At present\r\nthere is no legal provision for a standard in regard to the\r\ncomposition of sausages, but clearly there ought to be. Limitations\r\nshould be laid down as to the amount of bread used, as to the actual\r\nproportion of meat substances present, and as to the coloring matters\r\nadded to give an attractive appearance of fresh meat. Sausages are\r\nextremely liable to undergo decomposition and become poisonous, owing\r\nto the elaboration of toxic substances during the putrefactive\r\nprocess. Bad or rancid fat is very liable to alter the character of a\r\nsausage for the worse. Thus in some instances the use of rancid lard\r\nhas rendered the sausage after a time quite phosphorescent, an\r\nappearance which indicates, of course, an undesirable change. The\r\nsmoked sausage is a much safer article of diet than the unsmoked,\r\nsince the curing process preserves the meat substance against\r\ndecomposition by reason of the empyreumatic bodies present in the wood\r\nsmoke which is used for this purpose.\"\r\n\r\n=Photographing Papuan Children.=--Many savages dislike to have their\r\npictures taken, some being restrained by motives of superstition; but\r\nin New Guinea Professor Semon found being photographed a great joke\r\nfor all the boys and girls. He had much trouble in isolating a single\r\nindividual, so as not to get thirty or forty persons into his picture\r\ninstead of the one he wished to immortalize. \"Wishing,\" he says, \"to\r\nportray one young girl of uncommonly good looks, I separated her from\r\nthe rest, gave her a favorable position, and adjusted the lens,\r\nsurrounded all the while by a crowd of people behind and beside me,\r\nthe children cheering, the women most ardently attentive, the men\r\nbenevolently smiling. Evidently my subject was proud of the\r\ndistinction she enjoyed and the attention vouchsafed her. Quite\r\nsuddenly, however, this simple savage, untaught as she was and\r\ninnocent of the laws of reticence and prudishness, became convulsed\r\nwith shame, covered her eyes with her hands, and valiantly resisted\r\nevery attempt to make her stand forward as before. At the same time I\r\nnoticed that the hue of her features changed, the brown of her face\r\nbecoming darker and deeper than before, a phenomenon easily explained\r\nby the fact of the blood rising into her head. Had she been a brown\r\ngirl we would have said that she blushed. At all events, the\r\nphysiological process was the same as that which forces us to blush.\"\r\nAt another time, when the author had got two little girls into\r\nposition to be photographed, their mothers came up and forbade his\r\ntaking them that day, but promised to present them on the morrow. On\r\nthe next day \"both the little angels were solemnly brought to meet us\r\nnearly smothered in ornaments, their hair decorated with feathers and\r\ncombs, their ears with tortoise-shell pieces, their little throats\r\nsurrounded by plates of mother-of-pearl and chains of dingo teeth,\r\nlegs and arms hung with rings and shells, teeth, and all sorts of\r\nnetwork.... Here, again, one may see that mothers are made of the\r\nsame stuff all over the world, Papuan mammas being equal to any of our\r\npeasant women or fine ladies in the point of vanity as far as concerns\r\ntheir children.\"\r\n\r\n=Meat Extracts.=--An interesting account of the history and\r\npreparation of meat extracts was recently given as a lecture before\r\nthe Society of Arts (English) by Charles R. Valentine. The idea of\r\nconcentrating the body of an ox into a thimbleful of elixir seems to\r\nhave been a very old one. Until the work of Justus von Liebig, about\r\nfifty years ago, however, little progress of practical value was made\r\ntoward this end. Liebig macerated finely divided beef in cold water,\r\nor in water not above 150° F. The water dissolved from sixteen to\r\ntwenty-four per cent of the weight of the dry flesh. This infusion was\r\nheated, the albumen and red coloring matter of the blood coagulated,\r\nand was separated as a flocculent precipitate. The remaining solution\r\nhas the aromatic taste and all the properties of soup made by boiling\r\nthe flesh. The infusion was then evaporated at a gentle heat. The\r\nresidue amounted to about twelve or thirteen per cent of the original\r\n(dry) flesh. This is in rough outline the process of meat-extract\r\nmaking. This extract is simply an evaporated beef tea, containing the\r\nextractive matters of beef, and in virtue of these possesses medicinal\r\nand dietetic properties of value. But it is in no sense a substitute\r\nfor beef, as the latter's most important food constituent--albumen--it\r\ndoes not contain.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINOR PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\nIt appears from tables of Some Statistics of Engineering Education,\r\ncompiled by President M. E. Wadsworth, of the Michigan College of\r\nMines, that such education has been, in the United States, on the\r\nwhole a thing of comparatively recent date, the oldest school, the\r\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute, having been established in 1824; the\r\nnext, the Lawrence and Sheffield Schools, in 1846 and 1847; and the\r\nColumbia School in 1863. Civil engineering has led in this country,\r\nand has had various periods of advance, as in 1887-'88, and\r\ndepression, as in 1896-'97. Mechanical engineering progressed till\r\n1886-'87, when the number of students fell off, and the same happened\r\nwith electrical engineering, \"which further suffers a natural reaction\r\nfrom having been greatly overdone.\" As a rule, most of the schools in\r\nthe United States seem to run to specialties, one or two of the\r\ncourses being usually more conspicuous than the others.\r\n\r\nThe importance of some arrangement by which vessels may be informed of\r\neach other's approach in fog and darkness has given rise to many\r\ndevices; the only one, however, which has as yet proved practical is\r\nthe fog-horn or siren, and this has many disadvantages. Several fatal\r\ncollisions at sea during the past year have given rise to renewed\r\ninterest in the subject, and a number of new methods have been\r\nsuggested. M. Branley, a French physicist, in a note presented to the\r\nFrench Academy suggests that each vessel be provided with a number of\r\nextremely sensitive magnetic receivers, or coherers, and a powerful\r\nmagnetic transmitter. Periodical signals being made with the\r\ntransmitter, corresponding impressions would be made upon the\r\nreceivers of approaching vessels. The principal difficulty with this\r\nscheme lies in the fact that the receivers of a vessel will be\r\naffected by its own transmitter. There are several methods by which\r\nthis difficulty may be overcome, however. Different signals may be\r\nemployed, or the interval between signals may be regularly varied. M.\r\nBranley calls attention to the influence of a metallic envelope\r\nsurrounding a coherer, and shows that when the coherer is thus\r\ncompletely surrounded it is unaffected by the influence of a\r\ntransmitter. By thus inclosing the receiver on a ship at the instant\r\nof the operation of the transmitter of the same vessel, the above\r\ndifficulty might be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhile we can not collect roses from our gardens in January and maple\r\nblossoms from the woods in February, yet, as Prof. W. J. Beal shows in\r\na bulletin of the Michigan Agricultural College Experiment Station,\r\nour trees and shrubs in their winter garb furnish excellent lessons\r\nfor the profitable employment of pupils during many weeks at that\r\nseason in true botanical study. \"Let each member of a class be\r\nprovided with a branch, a foot or two long, from a sugar maple, and\r\nthen spend some ten to twenty minutes or more quietly looking at the\r\nbuds and the bark, with its scars and specks, and then tell what he\r\nhas discovered, venturing to explain the object or meaning of some of\r\nthe things he has seen. In a similar manner let each look over a\r\nbranch of beech and then point out the difference between the two\r\nkinds.\" Opening buds of trees may be obtained at any time during the\r\nwinter by placing the lower end of the stem in water for a week or two\r\nwhile in the schoolroom.\r\n\r\nEivind Astrup, in his book With Peary near the Pole, gives admiring\r\npictures of the natural innocence of the uncontaminated Eskimos of\r\nnorthern Greenland, where are communities in which \"money is unknown,\r\nand love of one's neighbor is a fundamental rule of action; where\r\ntheft is not practiced.\" All things are held in common, and falsehoods\r\nare told only to spare the feelings of the listener. Among the\r\ninstances of the native kindliness of these people is one where a dog\r\nhad eaten up a reindeer coat, yet was only remonstrated with by its\r\nowner. When the author suggested that a hungry dog should be punished\r\nfor stealing a piece of blubber, the owner said that it was himself\r\nwho deserved the thrashing for not having obtained sufficient food for\r\nthe dog.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History\r\nduring 1897 and 1898 were almost wholly connected with the work of the\r\nState Entomologist or with that of the Biological Station. The former\r\nwork related to various insects injurious to crops. The operations of\r\nthe Biological Station were carried on with more reference to\r\ncompleting a formal report upon the fishes of Illinois. The work is\r\nconducted with a view to the acquisition of correct ideas of the\r\nrelative abundance and local distribution of species, their haunts,\r\nhabits, regular migrations, and irregular movements, their building\r\ntimes and places, rate of growth, food, diseases, and enemies--and, in\r\nshort, the whole economy of each kind represented at the station and\r\nof the whole assemblage taken together as a community group. Extensive\r\nstudies of aquatic entomology were made, and a paper on ephemerids and\r\ndragon flies is nearly ready for the press. No part of the work of the\r\nstation, however, attracts more attention among scientific men, or is\r\nlikely to lead to more interesting and important results, than the\r\nplankton work, or the systematic study of the minute forms of plant\r\nand animal life suspended in the water. Water analyses have been\r\nextensively made in connection with these studies, which, combined\r\nwith the continuous biological work, will, when generalized, furnish a\r\nsubstantial and authoritative body of knowledge of the conditions of\r\nthe waters of the middle Illinois previous to the opening of the\r\nChicago drainage canal, useful for comparison with the results of\r\nsimilar studies made after that event. A summer school was conducted,\r\nwith fifteen pupils, in 1898, and publications were issued.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nThe Pasteur monument was dedicated at Lille, France, the city in which\r\nthe subject of the memorial performed his earlier more important\r\nresearches, April 9th. The ceremony was witnessed by a large assembly,\r\nwhich included many eminent scientific men of France and foreign\r\ncountries, among whom men engaged in similar researches to Pasteur's\r\nwere especially represented. The monument, the fruit of a public\r\nsubscription, represents Pasteur standing on the summit of a column of\r\nSoignies stone, holding in his right hand an experimental flask. At\r\nthe foot of the column a woman presents her child, which has been\r\nbitten by a mad dog, for treatment. To the left is a group\r\nrepresenting inoculation--a woman, personifying science, injecting\r\nserum into a child she holds on her knees. Three bas-reliefs represent\r\nrespectively Dr. Roux inoculating a sheep for anthrax, Pasteur\r\nstudying fermentation, and the first antirabic inoculation of the\r\nyoung Joseph Meister, who is held by his mother, wearing the\r\nbroad-flapped Alsatian bonnet. The statue is in light bronze, and with\r\nthe gilded bas-reliefs harmonizes well with the gray of the stone.\r\nAddresses were made by M. Armand Gautier and M. Duclaux, who said that\r\nthe improved laboratories now enjoyed by scientific institutions in\r\nParis were largely due to Pasteur's efforts.\r\n\r\nThe minor planet recently discovered by Witt, remarkable as having an\r\norbit that comes within that of Mars, and provisionally known as DQ,\r\nhas been named Eros. An examination by Professor Pickering and Mrs.\r\nFleming of the Harvard photographs has revealed traces of this body on\r\ntwelve plates taken in 1893 and 1894, and on four plates of 1896. By\r\nthe aid of these plates it has been possible to determine its elements\r\nwith greater accuracy than would otherwise be possible. Its mean\r\ndistance from the sun is 1.45810, its shortest distance 1.13334, and\r\nits greatest distance 1.78286 that of the earth; the eccentricity of\r\nits orbit is 0.222729, and its period is 643.10 days. Its synodical\r\nperiod is such that it has three oppositions in seven years. The next\r\nopposition will be in the last months of 1900, and will be a\r\nmoderately favorable one for observation.\r\n\r\nThe courses in pure science of the New York University include\r\nundergraduate, graduate, and summer courses in mathematics, physics,\r\nchemistry, geology, and biology, with laboratory privileges and\r\nprovision for special students and independent work in chemistry. The\r\nuniversity last year was attended by 1,717 students in its three\r\nfaculties and six schools, and 720 non-matriculant students and\r\nauditors. A new feature this year is the inauguration of the Charles\r\nF. Deems lectureship of philosophy, under an endowment of $15,000 by\r\nthe American Institute of Christian Philosophy, with Prof. James\r\nIverach, D. D., of the Free Church College, Aberdeen, Scotland, as the\r\nfirst lecturer. A feature of the university organization is the\r\ninstitution of a woman's advisory committee co-operating with the\r\ncouncil. A woman's law class is supported by the Woman's Legal\r\nEducation Society, the purpose of which is to make business women and\r\nwomen in private life acquainted with existing law.\r\n\r\nThe new Science Building of the City Library, Springfield, Mass.,\r\nrecently completed, is being inaugurated by a Geographical and\r\nGeological Exhibition. It includes the best and latest maps, models,\r\nglobes, charts, relief maps, and photographs, special attention being\r\npaid to the most effective modes of teaching. One of the most\r\nattractive features of the exhibition is the work from the Springfield\r\npublic schools.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious method for thawing out frozen water pipes has been used\r\nby Prof. R. W. Wood, of the University of Wisconsin. It consists\r\nsimply of passing a current of electricity through the pipe. In one\r\ncase it is said that one hundred and fifty feet of frozen pipe was\r\nthawed out in eighteen minutes. The ordinary street current was used,\r\nthe voltage being reduced to about fifty.\r\n\r\nIn a summary of inspectors' reports of the Hartford Steam Boiler\r\nInspection and Insurance Company for 1898 it is stated that of 78,349\r\nboilers, inspected both internally and externally, during the year,\r\nthere were 11,727 dangerous defects discovered and 603 entire boilers\r\nwere declared unsafe for further use.\r\n\r\nThe recent death list of men known in science includes the names of\r\nCharles Naudin, an eminent French botanist, Dean of the Botanical\r\nSection of the Academy of Sciences and author of a book on Hybrids in\r\nthe Vegetable Kingdom, at Antibes, France, March 19th, aged\r\neighty-four years; Dr. G. W. Leitner, an eminent Orientalist and\r\nlinguist, Lecturer on Oriental Language at King's College, London,\r\nPrincipal of Lahne College, and Registrar of Punjaub University, where\r\nhe introduced the use of their own language and literature in teaching\r\nIndian students, founder of the Anglo-Indian Institute at Woking,\r\nEngland, and author of works in Education, the Races of Turkey, The\r\nRaces and Languages of Dardistan, Græco-Buddhist Discoveries, and\r\nother Oriental subjects, at Bonn, March 24th, in his sixty-ninth year;\r\nDr. Angelo Knorr, Docent in the Veterinary School of Munich, February\r\n22d; Elizabeth Brown, astronomical observer and author of papers on\r\nsolar phenomena, at Cirencester, England, March 6th; Dr. Wilhelm von\r\nMüller, Professor General Chemistry in the Institute of Technology,\r\nMunich; Dr. Friedrich von Lühmann, mathematician, at Straslund,\r\nPrussia; Dr. Charles Fortuun, mineralogist, in London; Alfred\r\nFeuilleaubois, author of researches on Fungi, at Fontainebleau,\r\nFrance; Dr. Heinrich Kiefert, a geographer and cartographer whose fame\r\nwas world-wide, whose maps and atlases are everywhere recognized as\r\nauthorities, at Berlin, April 21st, aged seventy years; and Prof.\r\nSophus Lie, of the University of Christiania, an eminent\r\nmathematician, February 18th, in his fifty-seventh year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nWords surrounded by _ are italicized.\r\n\r\nWords surrounded by = are bold.\r\n\r\nObvious printer's errors have been repaired, other inconsistent\r\nspellings have been kept, including inconsistent use of hyphen (e.g.\r\n\"tortoise-shell\" and \"tortoise shell\"), and proper names (e.g.\r\n\"Shakspere\" and \"Shakespeare\").\r\n\r\nSome illustrations were relocated to correspond to their references in\r\nthe text.",
