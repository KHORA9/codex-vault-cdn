APPLETON AND COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this work is to give, in a connected form, a summary of the\r\ndevelopment of the vegetable kingdom in geological time.\r\n\r\nTo the geologist and botanist the subject is one of importance with\r\nreference to their special pursuits, and one on which it has not been\r\neasy to find any convenient manual of information. It is hoped that its\r\ntreatment in the present volume will also be found sufficiently simple\r\nand popular to be attractive to the general reader.\r\n\r\nIn a work of so limited dimensions, detailed descriptions cannot be\r\ngiven, except occasionally by way of illustration; but references to\r\nauthorities will be made in foot-notes, and certain details, which may be\r\nuseful to collectors and students, will be placed in notes appended to\r\nthe chapters, so as not to encumber the text.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of this work are for the most part original; but some\r\nof them have previously appeared in special papers of the author.\r\n\r\n                                                               J.

THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of fossil plants and of the history of the vegetable\r\nkingdom has, until recently, been so fragmentary that it seemed hopeless\r\nto attempt a detailed treatment of the subject of this little book. Our\r\nstores of knowledge have, however, been rapidly accumulating in recent\r\nyears, and we have now arrived at a stage when every new discovery serves\r\nto render useful and intelligible a vast number of facts previously\r\nfragmentary and of uncertain import.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this work, born in a district rich in fossil plants, began\r\nto collect and work at these as a boy, in connection with botanical and\r\ngeological pursuits. He has thus been engaged in the study of fossil\r\nplants for nearly half a century, and, while he has published much\r\non the subject, has endeavoured carefully to keep within the sphere\r\nof ascertained facts, and has made it a specialty to collect, as far\r\nas possible, what has been published by others. He has also enjoyed\r\nopportunities of correspondence or personal intercourse with most of the\r\nmore eminent workers in the subject. Now, in the evening of his days, he\r\nthinks it right to endeavour to place before the world a summary of facts\r\nand of his own matured conclusions--feeling, however, that nothing can\r\nbe final in this matter; and that he can only hope to sketch the present\r\naspect of the subject, and to point the way to new developments, which\r\nmust go on long after he shall have passed away.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one which has the disadvantage of presupposing\r\nsome knowledge of the geological history of the earth, and of the\r\nclassification and structures of modern plants; and in order that all\r\nwho may please to read the following pages may be placed, as nearly as\r\npossible, on the same level, this introductory chapter will be devoted to\r\na short statement of the general facts of geological chronology, and of\r\nthe natural divisions of the vegetable kingdom in their relations to that\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\nThe crust of the earth, as we somewhat modestly term that portion of\r\nits outer shell which is open to our observation, consists of many beds\r\nof rock superimposed on each other, and which must have been deposited\r\nsuccessively, beginning with the lowest. This is proved by the structure\r\nof the beds themselves, by the markings on their surfaces, and by the\r\nremains of animals and plants which they contain; all these appearances\r\nindicating that each successive bed must have been the surface before it\r\nwas covered by the next.\r\n\r\nAs these beds of rock were mostly formed under water, and of material\r\nderived from the waste of land, they are not universal, but occur\r\nin those places where there were extensive areas of water receiving\r\ndetritus from the land. Further, as the distinction of land and water\r\narises primarily from the shrinkage of the mass of the earth, and from\r\nthe consequent collapse of the crust in some places and ridging of it\r\nup in others, it follows that there have, from the earliest geological\r\nperiods, been deep ocean-basins, ridges of elevated land, and broad\r\nplateaus intervening between the ridges, and which were at some times\r\nunder water, and at other times land, with many intermediate phases.\r\nThe settlement and crumpling of the crust were not continuous, but took\r\nplace at intervals; and each such settlement produced not only a ridging\r\nup along certain lines, but also an emergence of the plains or plateaus.\r\nThus at all times there have been ridges of folded rock constituting\r\nmountain-ranges, flat expansions of continental plateau, sometimes dry\r\nand sometimes submerged, and deep ocean-basins, never except in some of\r\ntheir shallower portions elevated into land.\r\n\r\nBy the study of the successive beds, more especially of those deposited\r\nin the times of continental submergence, we obtain a table of geological\r\nchronology which expresses the several stages of the formation of the\r\nearth's crust, from that early time when a solid shell first formed on\r\nour nascent planet to the present day. By collecting the fossil remains\r\nembedded in the several layers and placing these in chronological order,\r\nwe obtain in like manner histories of animal and plant life parallel to\r\nthe physical changes indicated by the beds themselves. The facts as to\r\nthe sequence we obtain from the study of exposures in cliffs, cuttings,\r\nquarries, and mines; and by correlating these local sections in a great\r\nnumber of places, we obtain our general table of succession; though it is\r\nto be observed that in some single exposures or series of exposures, like\r\nthose in the great canons of Colorado, or on the coasts of Great Britain,\r\nwe can often in one locality see nearly the whole sequence of beds. Let\r\nus observe here also that, though we can trace these series of deposits\r\nover the whole of the surfaces of the continents, yet if the series could\r\nbe seen in one spot, say in one shaft sunk through the whole thickness of\r\nthe earth's crust, this would be sufficient for our purpose, so far as\r\nthe history of life is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is similar to that obtained by Schliemann on the site of\r\nTroy, where, in digging through successive layers of _débris_, he found\r\nthe objects deposited by successive occupants of the site, from the time\r\nof the Roman Empire back to the earliest tribes, whose flint weapons and\r\nthe ashes of their fires rest on the original surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nLet us now tabulate the whole geological succession with the history of\r\nanimals and plants associated with it:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANIMALS.

If we suppose the\r\nmodern period to have continued for say ten thousand years, and each\r\nof the others to have been equal to it, we shall require two hundred\r\nthousand years for the whole. There is, however, reason to believe,\r\nfrom the great thickness of the formations and the slowness of the\r\ndeposition of many of them in the older systems, that they must have\r\nrequired vastly greater time. Taking these criteria into account, it has\r\nbeen estimated that the time-ratios for the first three great ages may\r\nbe as one for the Kainozoic to three for the Mesozoic and twelve for\r\nthe Palæozoic, with as much for the Eozoic as for the Palæozoic. This\r\nis Dana's estimate. Another, by Hull and Houghton, gives the following\r\nratios: Azoic, 34·3 per cent.; Palæozoic, 42·5 per cent.; Mesozoic and\r\nKainozoic, 23·2 per cent. It is further held that the modern period\r\nis much shorter than the other periods of the Kainozoic, so that our\r\ngeological table may have to be measured by millions of years instead of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, however, attach any certain and definite value in years to\r\ngeological time, but must content ourselves with the general statement\r\nthat it has been vastly long in comparison to that covered by human\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind this great duration of geological time, and the fact that\r\nit probably extends from a period when the earth was intensely heated,\r\nits crust thin, and its continents as yet unformed, it will be evident\r\nthat the conditions of life in the earlier geologic periods may have been\r\nvery different from those which obtained later. When we further take\r\ninto account the vicissitudes of land and water which have occurred, we\r\nshall see that such changes must have produced very great differences of\r\nclimate. The warm equatorial waters have in all periods, as superficial\r\noceanic currents, been main agents in the diffusion of heat over the\r\nsurface of the earth, and their distribution to north and south must have\r\nbeen determined mainly by the extent and direction of land, though it\r\nmay also have been modified by the changes in the astronomical relations\r\nand period of the earth, and the form of its orbit.[A] We know by the\r\nevidence of fossil plants that changes of this kind have occurred\r\nso great as, on the one hand, to permit the plants of warm temperate\r\nregions to exist within the Arctic Circle; and, on the other, to drive\r\nthese plants into the tropics and to replace them by Arctic forms. It\r\nis evident also that in those periods when the continental areas were\r\nlargely submerged, there might be an excessive amount of moisture in\r\nthe atmosphere, greatly modifying the climate, in so far as plants are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n[A] Croll, \"Climate and Time.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the history of the vegetable kingdom as indicated in\r\nthe few notes in the right-hand column of the table.\r\n\r\nThe most general subdivision of plants is into the two great series of\r\nCryptogams, or those which have no manifest flowers, and produce minute\r\nspores instead of seeds; and Phænogams, or those which possess flowers\r\nand produce seeds containing an embryo of the future plant.\r\n\r\nThe Cryptogams may be subdivided into the following three groups:\r\n\r\n1. _Thallogens_, cellular plants not distinctly distinguishable into stem\r\nand leaf. These are the Fungi, the Lichens, and the Algæ, or sea-weeds.\r\n\r\n2. _Anogens_, having stem and foliage, but wholly cellular. These are the\r\nMosses and Liverworts.\r\n\r\n3. Acrogens, which have long tubular fibres as well as cells in\r\ntheir composition, and thus have the capacity of attaining a more\r\nconsiderable magnitude. These are the Ferns (_Filices_), the Mare's-tails\r\n(_Equisetaceæ_), and the Club-mosses (_Lycopodiaceæ_), and a curious\r\nlittle group of aquatic plants called Rhizocarps (_Rhizocarpeæ_).\r\n\r\nThe Phænogams are all vascular, but they differ much in the simplicity\r\nor complexity of their flowers or seeds. On this ground they admit of a\r\ntwofold division:\r\n\r\n1. _Gymnosperms_, or those which bear naked seeds not enclosed in fruits.\r\nThey are the Pines and their allies, and the Cycads.\r\n\r\n2. _Angiosperms_, which produce true fruits enclosing the seeds. In this\r\ngroup there are two well-marked subdivisions differing in the structure\r\nof the seed and stem. They are the _Endogens_, or inside growers, with\r\nseeds having one seed-leaf only, as the grasses and the palms; and\r\nthe _Exogens_, having outside-growing woody stems, and seeds with two\r\nseed-leaves. Most of the ordinary forest-trees of temperate climates\r\nbelong to this group.\r\n\r\nOn referring to the geological table, it will be seen that there is a\r\ncertain rough correspondence between the order of rank of plants and the\r\norder of their appearance in time. The oldest plants that we certainly\r\nknow are Algæ, and with these there are plants apparently with the\r\nstructures of Thallophytes but the habit of trees, and which, for want\r\nof a better name, I may call _Protogens_. Plants akin to the Rhizocarps\r\nalso appear very early. Next in order we find forests in which gigantic\r\nFerns and Lycopods and Mare's-tails predominate, and are associated\r\nwith pines. Succeeding these we have a reign of Gymnosperms, and in the\r\nlater formations we find the higher Phænogams dominant. Thus there is an\r\nadvance in elevation and complexity along with the advance in geological\r\ntime, but connected with the remarkable fact that in earlier times low\r\ngroups attain to an elevation unexampled in later times, when their\r\nplaces are occupied with plants of higher type.\r\n\r\nIt is this historical development that we have to trace in the following\r\npages, and it will be the most simple and at the same time the most\r\ninstructive method to consider it in the order of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nVEGETATION OF THE LAURENTIAN AND EARLY PALÆOZOIC--QUESTIONS AS TO ALGÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\nOldest of all the formations known to geologists, and representing\r\nperhaps the earliest rocks produced after our earth had ceased to be a\r\nmolten mass, are the hard, crystalline, and much-contorted rocks named\r\nby the late Sir W. E. Logan Laurentian, and which are largely developed\r\nin the northern parts of North America and Europe, and in many other\r\nregions. So numerous and extensive, indeed, are the exposures of these\r\nrocks, that we have good reason to believe that they underlie all the\r\nother formations of our continents, and are even world-wide in their\r\ndistribution. In the lower part of this great system of rocks which, in\r\nsome places at least, is thirty thousand feet in thickness, we find no\r\ntraces of the existence of any living thing on the earth. But, in the\r\nmiddle portion of the Laurentian, rocks are found which indicate that\r\nthere were already land and water, and that the waters and possibly the\r\nland were already tenanted by living beings. The great beds of limestone\r\nwhich exist in this part of the system furnish one indication of this. In\r\nthe later geological formations the limestones are mostly organic--that\r\nis, they consist of accumulated remains of shells, corals, and other\r\nhard parts of marine animals, which are composed of calcium carbonate,\r\nwhich the animals obtain directly from their food, and indirectly from\r\nthe calcareous matter dissolved in the sea-water. In like manner great\r\nbeds of iron-ore exist in the Laurentian; but in later formations the\r\ndetermining cause of the accumulation of such beds is the partial\r\ndeoxidation and solution of the peroxide of iron by the agency of\r\norganic matter. Besides this, certain forms known as _Eozoon Canadense_\r\nhave been recognised in the Laurentian limestones, which indicate the\r\npresence at least of one of the lower types of marine animals. Where\r\nanimal life is, we may fairly infer the existence of vegetable life as\r\nwell, since the plant is the only producer of food for the animal. But\r\nwe are not left merely to this inference. Great quantities of carbon\r\nor charcoal in the form of the substance known as graphite or plumbago\r\nexist in the Laurentian. Now, in more recent formations we have deposits\r\nof coal and bituminous matter, and we know that these have arisen from\r\nthe accumulation and slow putrefaction of masses of vegetable matter.\r\nFurther, in places where igneous action has affected the beds, we find\r\nthat ordinary coal has been changed into anthracite and graphite, that\r\nbituminous shales have been converted into graphitic shales, and that\r\ncracks filled with soft bituminous matter have ultimately become changed\r\ninto veins of graphite. When, therefore, we find in the Laurentian thick\r\nbeds of graphite and beds of limestone charged with detached grains and\r\ncrystals of this substance, and graphitic gneisses and schists and veins\r\nof graphite traversing the beds, we recognise the same phenomena that are\r\napparent in later formations containing vegetable _débris_.\r\n\r\nThe carbon thus occurring in the Laurentian is not to be regarded as\r\nexceptional or rare, but is widely distributed and of large amount. In\r\nCanada more especially the deposits are very considerable.\r\n\r\nThe graphite of the Laurentian of Canada occurs both in beds and in\r\nveins, and in such a manner as to show that its origin and deposition\r\nare contemporaneous with those of the containing rock. Sir William\r\nLogan states[B] that \"the deposits of plumbago generally occur in the\r\nlimestones or in their immediate vicinity, and granular varieties of the\r\nrock often contain large crystalline plates of plumbago. At other times\r\nthis mineral is so finely disseminated as to give a bluish-grey colour\r\nto the limestone, and the distribution of bands thus coloured seems to\r\nmark the stratification of the rock.\" He further states: \"The plumbago\r\nis not confined to the limestones; large crystalline scales of it are\r\noccasionally disseminated in pyroxene rock, and sometimes in quartzite\r\nand in feldspathic rocks, or even in magnetic oxide of iron.\" In addition\r\nto these bedded forms, there are also true veins in which graphite\r\noccurs associated with calcite, quartz, orthoclase, or pyroxene, and\r\neither in disseminated scales, in detached masses, or in bands or layers\r\n\"separated from each other and from the wall-rock by feldspar, pyroxene,\r\nand quartz.\" Dr. Hunt also mentions the occurrence of finely granular\r\nvarieties, and of that peculiarly waved and corrugated variety simulating\r\nfossil wood, though really a mere form of laminated structure, which also\r\noccurs at Warrensburg, New York, and at the Marinski mine in Siberia.\r\nMany of the veins are not true fissures, but rather constitute a network\r\nof shrinkage cracks or segregation veins traversing in countless numbers\r\nthe containing rock, and most irregular in their dimensions, so that they\r\noften resemble strings of nodular masses. It is most probable that the\r\ngraphite of the veins was originally introduced as a liquid or plastic\r\nhydrocarbon; but in whatever way introduced, the character of the veins\r\nindicates that in the case of the greater number of them the carbonaceous\r\nmaterial must have been derived from the bedded rocks traversed by these\r\nveins, to which it bears the same relation with the veins of bitumen\r\nfound in the bituminous shales of the Carboniferous and Silurian rocks.\r\nNor can there be any doubt that the graphite found in the beds has been\r\ndeposited along with the calcareous matter or muddy and sandy sediment of\r\nwhich these beds were originally composed.[C]\r\n\r\n[B] \"Geology of Canada,\" 1863.\r\n\r\n[C] Paper by the author on Laurentian Graphite, \"Journal of London\r\nGeological Society,\" 1876.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of graphite in the Lower Laurentian series is enormous. Some\r\nyears ago, in the township of Buckingham, on the Ottawa River, I examined\r\na band of limestone believed to be a continuation of that described by\r\nSir W. E. Logan as the Green Lake limestone. It was estimated to amount,\r\nwith some thin interstratified bands of gneiss, to a thickness of six\r\nhundred feet or more, and was found to be filled with disseminated\r\ncrystals of graphite and veins of the mineral to such an extent as to\r\nconstitute in some places one-fourth of the whole; and, making every\r\nallowance for the poorer portions, this band cannot contain in all a less\r\nvertical thickness of pure graphite than from twenty to thirty feet. In\r\nthe adjoining township of Lochaber Sir W. E. Logan notices a band from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty feet thick, reticulated with graphite veins to such\r\nan extent as to be mined with profit for the mineral. At another place\r\nin the same district a bed of graphite from ten to twelve feet thick,\r\nand yielding 20 per cent, of the pure material, is worked. As it appears\r\nin the excavation made by the quarrymen, it resembled a bed of coal; and\r\na block from this bed, about four feet thick, was a prominent object in\r\nthe Canadian department of the Colonial Exhibition of 1886. When it is\r\nconsidered that graphite occurs in similar abundance at several other\r\nhorizons, in beds of limestone which have been ascertained by Sir W. E.\r\nLogan to have an aggregate thickness of thirty-five hundred feet, it\r\nis scarcely an exaggeration to maintain that the quantity of carbon in\r\nthe Laurentian is equal to that in similar areas of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem. It is also to be observed that an immense area in Canada appears\r\nto be occupied by these graphitic and _Eozoon_ limestones, and that rich\r\ngraphitic deposits exist in the continuation of this system in the State\r\nof New York, while in rocks believed to be of this age near St. John,\r\nNew Brunswick, there is a very thick bed of graphitic limestone, and\r\nassociated with it three regular beds of graphite, having an aggregate\r\nthickness of about five feet.[D]\r\n\r\n[D] Matthew in \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,\" vol. xxi.,\r\np. 423. \"Acadian Geology,\" p. 662.\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be assumed that in the present world, and in those\r\ngeological periods with whose organic remains we are more familiar than\r\nwith those of the Laurentian, there is no other source of unoxidized\r\ncarbon in rocks than that furnished by organic matter, and that this\r\nhas obtained its carbon in all cases, in the first instance, from the\r\ndeoxidation of carbonic acid by living plants. No other source of carbon\r\ncan, I believe, be imagined in the Laurentian period. We may, however,\r\nsuppose either that the graphitic matter of the Laurentian has been\r\naccumulated in beds like those of coal, or that it has consisted of\r\ndiffused bituminous matter similar to that in more modern bituminous\r\nshales and bituminous and oil-bearing limestones. The beds of graphite\r\nnear St. John, some of those in the gneiss at Ticonderoga in New York,\r\nand at Lochaber and Buckingham, and elsewhere in Canada, are so pure and\r\nregular that one might fairly compare them with the graphitic coal of\r\nRhode Island. These instances, however, are exceptional, and the greater\r\npart of the disseminated and vein graphite might rather be likened in\r\nits mode of occurrence to the bituminous matter in bituminous shales and\r\nlimestones.\r\n\r\nWe may compare the disseminated graphite to that which we find in those\r\ndistricts of Canada in which Silurian and Devonian bituminous shales\r\nand limestones have been metamorphosed and converted into graphitic\r\nrocks not very dissimilar to those in the less altered portions of\r\nthe Laurentian.[E] In like manner it seems probable that the numerous\r\nreticulating veins of graphite may have been formed by the segregation\r\nof bituminous matter into fissures and planes of least resistance, in\r\nthe manner in which such veins occur in modern bituminous limestones\r\nand shales. Such bituminous veins occur in the Lower Carboniferous\r\nlimestone and shale of Dorchester and Hillsborough, New Brunswick, with\r\nan arrangement very similar to that of the veins of graphite; and in\r\nthe Quebec rocks of Point Levi, veins attaining to a thickness of more\r\nthan a foot, are filled with a coaly matter having a transverse columnar\r\nstructure, and regarded by Logan and Hunt as an altered bitumen. These\r\npalæozoic analogies would lead us to infer that the larger part of the\r\nLaurentian graphite falls under the second class of deposits above\r\nmentioned, and that, if of vegetable origin, the organic matter must have\r\nbeen thoroughly disintegrated and bituminised before it was changed into\r\ngraphite. This would also give a probability that the vegetation implied\r\nwas aquatic, or at least that it was accumulated under water.\r\n\r\n[E] Granby, Melbourne, Owl's Head, &c., \"Geology of Canada,\" 1863, p. 599.\r\n\r\nDr. Hunt has, however, observed an indication of terrestrial vegetation,\r\nor at least of subaërial decay, in the great beds of Laurentian iron-ore.\r\nThese, if formed in the same manner as more modern deposits of this kind,\r\nwould imply the reducing and solvent action of substances produced in the\r\ndecay of plants. In this case such great ore-beds as that of Hull, on the\r\nOttawa, seventy feet thick, or that near Newborough, two hundred feet\r\nthick,[F] must represent a corresponding quantity of vegetable matter\r\nwhich has totally disappeared. It may be added that similar demands on\r\nvegetable matter as a deoxidising agent are made by the beds and veins of\r\nmetallic sulphides of the Laurentian, though some of the latter are no\r\ndoubt of later date than the Laurentian rocks themselves.\r\n\r\n[F] \"Geology of Canada,\" 1863.\r\n\r\nIt would be very desirable to confirm such conclusions as those above\r\ndeduced by the evidence of actual microscopic structure. It is to be\r\nobserved, however, that when, in more modern sediments, Algæ have been\r\nconverted into bituminous matter, we cannot ordinarily obtain any\r\nstructural evidence of the origin of such bitumen, and in the graphitic\r\nslates and limestones derived from the metamorphosis of such rocks\r\nno organic structure remains. It is true that, in certain bituminous\r\nshales and limestones of the Silurian system, shreds of organic\r\ntissue can sometimes be detected, and in some cases, as in the Lower\r\nSilurian limestone of the La Cloche Mountains in Canada, the pores\r\nof brachiopodous shells and the cells of corals have been penetrated\r\nby black bituminous matter, forming what may be regarded as natural\r\ninjections, sometimes of much beauty. In correspondence with this, while\r\nin some Laurentian graphitic rocks, as, for instance, in the compact\r\ngraphite of Clarendon, the carbon presents a curdled appearance due to\r\nsegregation, and precisely similar to that of the bitumen in more modern\r\nbituminous rocks, I can detect in the graphitic limestones occasional\r\nfibrous structures which may be remains of plants, and in some specimens\r\nvermicular lines, which I believe to be tubes of Eozoon penetrated by\r\nmatter once bituminous, but now in the state of graphite.\r\n\r\nWhen palæozoic land-plants have been converted into graphite, they\r\nsometimes perfectly retain their structure. Mineral charcoal, with\r\nstructure, exists in the graphitic coal of Rhode Island. The fronds of\r\nferns, with their minutest veins perfect, are preserved in the Devonian\r\nshales of St. John, in the state of graphite; and in the same formation\r\nthere are trunks of Conifers (_Dadoxylon Ouangondianum_) in which the\r\nmaterial of the cell-walls has been converted into graphite, while\r\ntheir cavities have been filled with calcareous spar and quartz, the\r\nfinest structures being preserved quite as well as in comparatively\r\nunaltered specimens from the coal-formation.[G] No structures so perfect\r\nhave as yet been detected in the Laurentian, though in the largest\r\nof the three graphitic beds at St. John there appear to be fibrous\r\nstructures, which I believe may indicate the existence of land-plants.\r\nThis graphite is composed of contorted and slickensided laminæ, much\r\nlike those of some bituminous shales and coarse coals; and in these are\r\noccasional small pyritous masses which show hollow carbonaceous fibres,\r\nin some cases presenting obscure indications of lateral pores. I regard\r\nthese indications, however, as uncertain; and it is not as yet fully\r\nascertained that these beds at St. John are on the same geological\r\nhorizon with the Lower Laurentian of Canada, though they certainly\r\nunderlie the Primordial series of the Acadian group, and are separated\r\nfrom it by beds having the character of the Huronian.\r\n\r\n[G] \"Acadian Geology,\" p. 535. In calcined specimens the structures\r\nremain in the graphite after decalcification by an acid.\r\n\r\nThere is thus no absolute impossibility that distinct organic tissues\r\nmay be found in the Laurentian graphite, if formed from land-plants,\r\nmore especially if any plants existed at that time having true woody or\r\nvascular tissues; but it cannot with certainty be affirmed that such\r\ntissues have been found. It is possible, however, that in the Laurentian\r\nperiod the vegetation of the land may have consisted wholly of cellular\r\nplants, as, for example, mosses and lichens; and if so, there would be\r\ncomparatively little hope of the distinct preservation of their forms or\r\ntissues, or of our being able to distinguish the remains of land-plants\r\nfrom those of Algæ.\r\n\r\nWe may sum up these facts and considerations in the following statements:\r\nFirst, that somewhat obscure traces of organic structure can be detected\r\nin the Laurentian graphite; secondly, that the general arrangement and\r\nmicroscopic structure of the substance corresponds with that of the\r\ncarbonaceous and bituminous matters in marine formations of more modern\r\ndate; thirdly, that if the Laurentian graphite has been derived from\r\nvegetable matter, it has only undergone a metamorphosis similar in kind\r\nto that which organic matter in metamorphosed sediments of later age\r\nhas experienced; fourthly, that the association of the graphitic matter\r\nwith organic limestone, beds of iron-ore, and metallic sulphides greatly\r\nstrengthens the probability of its vegetable origin; fifthly, that\r\nwhen we consider the immense thickness and extent of the Eozoonal and\r\ngraphitic limestones and iron-ore deposits of the Laurentian, if we admit\r\nthe organic origin of the limestone and graphite, we must be prepared to\r\nbelieve that the life of that early period, though it may have existed\r\nunder low forms, was most copiously developed, and that it equalled,\r\nperhaps surpassed, in its results, in the way of geological accumulation,\r\nthat of any subsequent period.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, at the meeting of the American Association in Albany, the\r\nwriter was carrying into the room of the Geological Section a mass of\r\nfossil wood from the Devonian of Gaspé, when he met the late Professor\r\nAgassiz, and remarked that the specimen was the remains of a Devonian\r\ntree contemporaneous with his fishes of that age. \"How I wish I could\r\nsit under its shade!\" was the smiling reply of the great zoölogist; and\r\nwhen we think of the great accumulations of Laurentian carbon, and that\r\nwe are entirely ignorant of the forms and structures of the vegetation\r\nwhich produced it, we can scarcely suppress a feeling of disappointment.\r\nSome things, however, we can safely infer from the facts that are known,\r\nand these it may be well to mention.\r\n\r\nThe climate and atmosphere of the Laurentian may have been well adapted\r\nfor the sustenance of vegetable life. We can scarcely doubt that the\r\ninternal heat of the earth still warmed the waters of the sea, and these\r\nwarm waters must have diffused great quantities of mists and vapours over\r\nthe land, giving a moist and equable if not a very clear atmosphere. The\r\nvast quantities of carbon dioxide afterwards sealed up in limestones and\r\ncarbonaceous beds must also have still floated in the atmosphere and must\r\nhave supplied abundance of the carbon, which constitutes the largest\r\ningredient in vegetable tissues. Under these circumstances the whole\r\nworld must have resembled a damp, warm greenhouse, and plants loving such\r\nan atmosphere could have grown luxuriantly. In these circumstances the\r\nlower forms of aquatic vegetation and those that love damp, warm air and\r\nwet soil would have been at home.\r\n\r\nIf we ask more particularly what kinds of plants might be expected to be\r\nintroduced in such circumstances, we may obtain some information from the\r\nvegetation of the succeeding Palæozoic age, when such conditions still\r\ncontinued to a modified extent. In this period the club-mosses, ferns,\r\nand mare's-tails engrossed the world and grew to sizes and attained\r\ndegrees of complexity of structure not known in modern times. In the\r\nprevious Laurentian age something similar may have happened to Algæ, to\r\nFungi, to Lichens, to Liverworts, and Mosses. The Algæ may have attained\r\nto gigantic dimensions, and may have even ascended out of the water in\r\nsome of their forms. These comparatively simple cellular and tubular\r\nstructures, now degraded to the humble position of flat lichens or soft\r\nor corky fungi, or slender cellular mosses, may have been so strengthened\r\nand modified as to constitute forest-trees. This would be quite in\r\nharmony with what is observed in the development of other plants in\r\nprimitive geological times; and a little later in this history we shall\r\nsee that there is evidence in the flora of the Silurian of a survival of\r\nsuch forms.\r\n\r\nIt may be that no geologist or botanist will ever be able to realise\r\nthese dreams of the past. But, on the other hand, it is quite possible\r\nthat some fortunate chance may have somewhere preserved specimens of\r\nLaurentian plants showing their structure.\r\n\r\nIn any case we have here presented to us the strange and startling fact\r\nthat the remarkable arrangement of protoplasmic matter and chlorophyll,\r\nwhich enables the vegetable cell to perform, with the aid of solar\r\nlight, the miracle of decomposing carbon dioxide and water, and forming\r\nwith them woody and corky tissues, had already been introduced upon the\r\nearth. It has been well said that no amount of study of inorganic nature\r\nwould ever have enabled any one to anticipate the possibility of the\r\nconstruction of an apparatus having the chemical powers of the living\r\nvegetable cell. Yet this most marvellous structure seems to have been\r\nintroduced in the full plenitude of its powers in the Laurentian age.\r\n\r\nWhether this early Laurentian vegetation was the means of sustaining\r\nany animal life other than marine Protozoa, we do not know. It may\r\nhave existed for its own sake alone, or merely as a purifier of the\r\natmosphere, in preparation for the future introduction of land-animals.\r\nThe fact that there have existed, even in modern times, oceanic islands\r\nrich in vegetation, yet untenanted by the higher forms of animal life,\r\nprepares us to believe that such conditions may have been general or\r\nuniversal in the primeval times we are here considering.\r\n\r\nIf we ask to what extent the carbon extracted from the atmosphere and\r\nstored up in the earth has been, or is likely to be, useful to man, the\r\nanswer must be that it is not in a state to enable it to be used as\r\nmineral fuel. It has, however, important uses in the arts, though at\r\npresent the supply seems rather in excess of the demand, and it may well\r\nbe that there are uses of graphite still undiscovered, and to which it\r\nwill yet be applied.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is deserving of notice that, if Laurentian graphite indicates\r\nvegetable life, it indicates this in vast profusion. That incalculable\r\nquantities of vegetable matter have been oxidised and have disappeared we\r\nmay believe on the evidence of the vast beds of iron-ore; and, in regard\r\nto that preserved as graphite, it is certain that every inch of that\r\nmineral must indicate many feet of crude vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, in ascending from the Laurentian, we do not at\r\nfirst appear to advance in evidences of plant-life. The Huronian age,\r\nwhich succeeded the Laurentian, seems to have been a disturbed and\r\nunquiet time, and, except in certain bands of iron-ore and some dark\r\nslates coloured with carbonaceous matter, we find in it no evidence\r\nof vegetation. In the Cambrian a great subsidence of our continents\r\nbegan, which went on, though with local intermissions and reversals, all\r\nthrough the Siluro-Cambrian or Ordovician time. These times were, for\r\nthis reason, remarkable for the great abundance and increase of marine\r\nanimals rather than of land-plants. Still, there are some traces of land\r\nvegetation, and we may sketch first the facts of this kind which are\r\nknown, and then advert to some points relating to the earlier Algæ, or\r\nsea-weeds.\r\n\r\nAn eminent Swedish geologist, Linnarsson, has described, under the name\r\nof _Eophyton_, certain impressions on old Cambrian rocks in Sweden, and\r\nwhich certainly present very plant-like forms. They want, however, any\r\ntrace of carbonaceous matter, and seem rather to be grooves or marks cut\r\nin clay by the limbs or tails of some aquatic animal, and afterwards\r\nfilled up and preserved by succeeding deposits. After examining large\r\nseries of these specimens from Sweden, and from rocks of similar age in\r\nCanada, I confess that I have no faith in their vegetable nature.\r\n\r\nThe oldest plants known to me, and likely to have been of higher grade\r\nthan Algæ, are specimens kindly presented to me by Dr. Alleyne Nicholson,\r\nof Aberdeen, and which he had named _Buthotrephis Harknessii_[H] and _B.\r\nradiata_. They are from the Skiddaw rocks of Cumberland. On examining\r\nthese specimens, and others subsequently collected in the same locality\r\nby Dr. Gr. M. Dawson, while convinced by their form and carbonaceous\r\ncharacter that they are really plants, I am inclined to refer them not\r\nto Algæ, but probably to Rhizocarps. They consist of slender branching\r\nstems, with whorls of elongate and pointed leaves, resembling the genus\r\n_Annularia_ of the coal formation. I am inclined to believe that both\r\nof Nicholson's species are parts of one plant, and for this I have\r\nproposed the generic name _Protannularia_ (Fig. 1). Somewhat higher in\r\nthe Siluro-Cambrian, in the Cincinnati group of America, Lesquereux\r\nhas found some minute radiated leaves, referred by him to the genus\r\n_Sphenophyllum_,[I] which is also allied to Rhizocarps. Still more\r\nremarkable is the discovery in the same beds of a stem with rhombic\r\nareoles or leaf-bases, to which the name _Protostigma_ has been given.[J]\r\nIf a plant, this may have been allied to the club-mosses. This seems to\r\nbe all that we at present know of land-vegetation in the Siluro-Cambrian.\r\nSo far as the remains go, they indicate the presence of the families of\r\nRhizocarps and of Lycopods.\r\n\r\n[H] \"Geological Magazine,\" 1869.\r\n\r\n[I] See figure in next chapter.\r\n\r\n[J] _Protostigma sigillarioides_, Lesquereux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--_Protannularia Harknessii_ (Nicholson), a\r\nprobable Rhizocarp of the Ordovician period.]\r\n\r\nIf we ascend into the Upper Silurian, or Silurian proper, the evidences\r\nof land vegetation somewhat increase. In 1859 I described, in \"The\r\nJournal of the Geological Society\" of London, a remarkable tree from the\r\nLower Erian of Gaspé, under the name _Prototaxites_, but for which I\r\nnow prefer the name _Nematophyton_. When in London, in 1870, I obtained\r\npermission to examine certain specimens of spore-cases or seeds from\r\nthe Upper Ludlow (Silurian) formation of England, and which had been\r\ndescribed by Sir Joseph Hooker under the name _Pachytheca_. In the same\r\nslabs with these I found fragments of fossil wood identical with those of\r\nthe Gaspé plant. Still later I recognised similar fragments associated\r\nalso with _Pachytheca_ in the Silurian of Cape Bon Ami, New Brunswick.\r\nLastly, Dr. Hicks has discovered similar wood, and also similar fruits,\r\nin the Denbighshire grits, at the base of the Silurian.[K]\r\n\r\n[K] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" August, 1881.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--_Nematophyton Logani_ (magnified). Vertical\r\nsection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--_Nematophyton Logani_ (magnified). Horizontal\r\nsection, showing part of one of the radial spaces, with tubes passing\r\ninto it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--_Nematophyton Logani_ (magnified).\r\nRestoration.[L]]\r\n\r\n[L] Figs. 2, 3, and 4 are drawn from nature by Prof. Penhallow, of McGill\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nFrom comparison of this singular wood, the structure of which is\r\nrepresented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, with the _débris_ of fossil taxine woods,\r\nmineralised after long maceration in water, I was inclined to regard\r\n_Prototaxites_, or, as I have more recently named it, _Nematophyton_, as\r\na primeval gymnosperm allied to those trees which Unger had described\r\nfrom the Erian of Thuringia, under the name _Aporoxylon_.[M] Later\r\nexamples of more lax tissues from branches or young stems, and the\r\nelaborate examinations kindly undertaken for me by Professor Penhallow\r\nand referred to in a note to this chapter, have induced me to modify\r\nthis view, and to hold that the tissues of these singular trees, which\r\nseem to have existed from the beginning of the Silurian age and to have\r\nfinally disappeared in the early Erian, are altogether distinct from\r\nany form of vegetation hitherto known, and are possibly survivors of\r\nthat prototypal flora to which I have already referred. They are trees\r\nof large size, with a coaly bark and large spreading roots, having the\r\nsurface of the stem smooth or irregularly ribbed, but with a nodose or\r\njointed appearance. Internally, they show a tissue of long, cylindrical\r\ntubes, traversed by a complex network of horizontal tubes thinner walled\r\nand of smaller size. The tubes are arranged in concentric zones, which,\r\nif annual rings, would in some specimens indicate an age of one hundred\r\nand fifty years. There are also radiating spaces, which I was at first\r\ndisposed to regard as true medullary rays, or which at least indicate a\r\nradiating arrangement of the tissue. They now seem to be spaces extending\r\nfrom the centre towards the circumference of the stem, and to have\r\ncontained bundles of tubes gathered from the general tissue and extending\r\noutward perhaps to organs or appendages on the surface. Carruthers has\r\nsuggested a resemblance to Algæ, and has even proposed to change the\r\nname to _Nematophycus_, or \"thread-sea-weed\"; but the resemblance is\r\nby no means clear, and it would be quite as reasonable to compare the\r\ntissue to that of some Fungi or Lichens, or even to suppose that a plant\r\ncomposed of cylindrical tubes has been penetrated by the mycelium or\r\nspawn of a dry-rot fungus. But the tissues are too constant and too\r\nmanifestly connected with each other to justify this last supposition.\r\nThat the plant grew on land I cannot doubt, from its mode of occurrence;\r\nthat it was of durable and resisting character is shown by its state\r\nof preservation; and the structure of the seeds called _Pachytheca_,\r\nwith their constant association with these trees, give countenance to\r\nthe belief that they are the fruit of Nematophyton. Of the foliage or\r\nfronds of these strange plants we unfortunately know nothing. They seem,\r\nhowever, to realise the idea of arboreal plants having structures akin\r\nto those of thallophytes, but with seeds so large and complex that they\r\ncan scarcely be regarded as mere spores. They should perhaps constitute a\r\nseparate class or order to which the name _Nematodendreæ_ may be given,\r\nand of which _Nematophyton_ will constitute one genus and _Aporoxylon_ of\r\nUnger another.[N]\r\n\r\n[M] \"Palæontologie des Thuringer Waldes,\" 1856.\r\n\r\n[N] See report by the author on \"Erian Flora of Canada,\" 1871 and 1882,\r\nfor full description of these fossils.\r\n\r\nAnother question arises as to the possible relation of these plants\r\nto other trees known by their external forms. The _Protostigma_ of\r\nLesquereux has already been referred to, and Claypole has described\r\na tree from the Clinton group of the United States, with large ovate\r\nleaf-bases, to which he has given the name _Glyptodendron_.[O] If the\r\nmarkings on these plants are really leaf-bases, they can scarcely have\r\nbeen connected with _Nematophyton_, because that tree shows no such\r\nsurface-markings, though, as we have seen, it had bundles of tubes\r\npassing diagonally to the surface. These plants were more probably\r\ntrees with an axis of barred vessels and thick, cellular bark, like\r\nthe _Lepidodendron_ of later periods, to be noticed in the sequel. Dr.\r\nHicks has also described from the same series of beds which afforded\r\nthe fragments of Nematophyton certain carbonised dichotomous stems,\r\nwhich he has named _Berwynia_. It is just possible that these plants may\r\nhave belonged to the Nematodendreæ. The thick and dense coaly matter\r\nwhich they show resembles the bark of these trees, the longitudinal\r\nstriation in some of them may represent the fibrous structure, and the\r\nlateral projections which have been compared to leaves or leaf-bases\r\nmay correspond with the superficial eminences of _Nematophyton_, and\r\nthe spirally arranged punctures which it shows on its surface. In\r\nthis case I should be disposed to regard the supposed stigmaria-like\r\nroots as really stems, and the supposed rootlets as short, spine-like\r\nrudimentary leaves. All such comparisons must, however, in the mean time\r\nbe regarded as conjectural. We seem, however, to have here a type of tree\r\nvery dissimilar to any even of the later Palæozoic age, which existed\r\nthroughout the Silurian, and probably further back, which ceased to\r\nexist early in the Erian age, and before the appearance of the ordinary\r\nconiferous and lepidodendroid trees. May it not have been a survivor of\r\nan old arboreal flora extending back even to the Laurentian itself?\r\n\r\n[O] \"American Journal of Science,\" 1878.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of markings occurring on the surfaces of the older rocks have\r\nbeen referred to the Algæ or sea-weeds, and indeed this group has been\r\na sort of refuge for the destitute to which palæontologists have been\r\naccustomed to refer any anomalous or inexplicable form which, while\r\nprobably organic, could not be definitely referred to the animal kingdom.\r\nThere can be no question that some of these are truly marine plants; and\r\nthat plants of this kind occur in formations older than those in which\r\nwe first find land-plants, and that they have continued to inhabit the\r\nsea down to the present time. It is also true that the oldest of these\r\nAlgæ closely resemble in form plants of this kind still existing; and,\r\nsince their simple cellular structures and soft tissues are scarcely\r\never preserved, their general forms are all that we can know, so that\r\ntheir exact resemblance to or difference from modern types can rarely\r\nbe determined. For the same reasons it has proved difficult clearly to\r\ndistinguish them from mere inorganic markings or the traces of animals,\r\nand the greatest divergence of opinion has occurred in recent times\r\non these subjects, as any one can readily understand who consults the\r\nvoluminous and well-illustrated memoirs of Nathorst, Williamson, Saporta,\r\nand Delgado.\r\n\r\nThe author of this work has given much attention to these remains, and\r\nhas not been disposed to claim for the vegetable kingdom so many of them\r\nas some of his contemporaries.[P] The considerations which seem most\r\nimportant in making such distinctions are the following: 1. The presence\r\nor absence of carbonaceous matter. True Algæ not infrequently present at\r\nleast a thin film of carbon representing their organic matter, and this\r\nis the more likely to occur in their case, as organic matters buried in\r\nmarine deposits and not exposed to atmospheric oxidation are very likely\r\nto be preserved. 2. In the absence of organic matter, the staining of\r\nthe containing rock, the disappearance or deoxidation of its ferruginous\r\ncolouring matter, or the presence of iron pyrite may indicate the removal\r\nof organic matter by decay. 3. When organic matter and indications of it\r\nare altogether absent, and form alone remains, we have to distinguish\r\nfrom Algæ, trails and burrows similar to those of aquatic animals, casts\r\nof shrinkage-cracks, water-marks, and rill-marks widely diffused over the\r\nsurfaces of beds. 4. Markings depressed on the upper surfaces of beds,\r\nand filled with the material of the succeeding layer, are usually mere\r\nimpressions. The cases of possible exceptions to this are very rare. On\r\nthe contrary, there are not infrequently forms in relief on the surfaces\r\nof rocks which are not Algæ, but may be shallow burrows arched upward on\r\ntop, or castings of worms thrown up upon the surface. Sometimes, however,\r\nthey may have been left by denudation of the surrounding material, just\r\nas footprints on dry snow remain in relief after the surrounding loose\r\nmaterial has been drifted away by the wind; the portion consolidated by\r\npressure being better able to resist the denuding agency.\r\n\r\n[P] \"Impressions and Footprints of Aquatic Animals,\" \"American Journal of\r\nScience,\" 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Trail of a modern king-crab, to illustrate\r\nimitations of plants sometimes named _Bilobites_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Trail of Carboniferous crustacean (_Rusichnites\r\nAcadicus_), Nova Scotia, to illustrate supposed Algæ.]\r\n\r\nThe footprints from the Potsdam sandstone in Canada, for which the name\r\n_Protichnites_ was proposed by Owen, and which were by him referred to\r\ncrustaceans probably resembling _Limulus_, were shown by the writer,\r\nin 1862,[Q] to correspond precisely with those of the American Limulus\r\n(_Polyphemus Occidentalis_) (Fig. 5). I proved by experiment with the\r\nmodern animal that the recurring series of groups of markings were\r\nproduced by the toes of the large posterior thoracic feet, the irregular\r\nscratches seen in _Protichnites lineatus_ by the ordinary feet, and the\r\ncentral furrow by the tail. It was also shown that when the Limulus uses\r\nits swimming-feet it produces impressions of the character of those\r\nnamed _Climactichnites_, from the same beds which afford _Protichnites_.\r\nThe principal difference between _Protichnites_ and their modern\r\nrepresentatives is that the latter have two lateral furrows produced by\r\nthe sides of the carapace, which are wanting in the former.\r\n\r\n[Q] \"Canadian Naturalist,\" vol. vii.\r\n\r\nI subsequently applied the same explanation to several other ancient\r\nforms now known under the general name _Bilobites_ (Figs. 6 and 7).[R]\r\n\r\n[R] The name Bilobites was originally proposed by De Kay for a bivalve\r\nshell (Conocardium). Its application to supposed Algæ was an error, but\r\nthis is of the less consequence, as these are not true plants but only\r\nanimal trails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--_Rusophycus_ (_Rusichnites_) _Grenvillensis_,\r\nan animal burrow of the Siluro-Cambrian, probably of a crustacean, _a_,\r\nTrack connected with it.]\r\n\r\nThe tuberculated impressions known as _Phymatoderma_ and _Caulerpites_\r\nmay, as Zeiller has shown, be made by the burrowing of the mole-cricket,\r\nand fine examples occurring in the Clinton formation of Canada are\r\nprobably the work of Crustacea. It is probable, however, that some of\r\nthe later forms referred to these genera are really Algæ related to\r\n_Caulerpa_, or even branches of Conifers of the genus _Brachyphyllum_.\r\n\r\n_Nereites_ and _Planulites_ are tracks and burrows of worms, with\r\nor without marks of setæ, and some of the markings referred to\r\n_Palæochorda_, _Palæophycus_, and _Scolithus_ have their places here.\r\nMany examples highly illustrative of the manner of formation of the\r\nimpressions are afforded by Canadian rocks (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\nBranching forms referred to _Licrophycus_ of Billings, and some of\r\nthose referred to _Buthotrephis_, Hall, as well as radiating markings\r\nreferable to _Scotolithus_, _Gyrophyllites_, and _Asterophycus_, are\r\nexplained by the branching burrows of worms illustrated by Nathorst\r\nand the author. _Astropolithon_, a singular radiating marking of the\r\nCanadian Cambrian,[S] seems to be something organic, but of what nature\r\nis uncertain (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n[S] Supplement to \"Acadian Geology.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--_Palæophycus Beverlyensis_ (Billings), a supposed\r\nCambrian Fucoid, but probably an animal trail.]\r\n\r\n_Rhabdichnites_ and _Eophyton_ belong to impressions explicable by the\r\ntrails of drifting sea-weeds, the tail-markings of Crustacea, and the\r\nruts ploughed by bivalve mollusks, and occurring in the Silurian, Erian,\r\nand Carboniferous rocks.[T] Among these are the singular bilobate forms\r\ndescribed as _Rusophycus_ by Hall, and which are probably burrows or\r\nresting-places of crustaceans. The tracks of such animals, when walking,\r\nare the jointed impressions known as _Arthrophycus_ and _Crusiana_.\r\nI have shown by the mode of occurrence of these, and Nathorst has\r\nconfirmed this conclusion by elaborate experiments on living animals,\r\nthat these forms are really trails impressed on soft sediments by animals\r\nand mostly by crustaceans.\r\n\r\n[T] \"Canadian Naturalist,\" 1864.\r\n\r\nI agree with Dr. Williamson[U] in believing that all or nearly all the\r\nforms referred to Crossochorda of Schimper are really animal impressions\r\nallied to Nereites, and due either to worms or, as Nathorst has shown to\r\nbe possible, to small crustaceans. Many impressions of this kind occur in\r\nthe Silurian beds of the Clinton series in Canada and New York, and are\r\nundoubtedly mere markings.\r\n\r\n[U] \"Tracks from Yoredale Rocks,\" \"Manchester Literary and Philosophical\r\nSociety,\" 1885.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--_Astropolithon Hindii_, an organism of the Lower\r\nCambrian of Nova Scotia, possibly vegetable.]\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that these markings strikingly resemble the\r\nso-called _Eophyton_, described by Torell from the Primordial of\r\nSweden, and by Billings from that of Newfoundland; and which also occur\r\nabundantly in the Primordial of New Brunswick. After examining a series\r\nof these markings from Sweden shown to me by Mr. Carruthers in London,\r\nand also specimens from Newfoundland and a large number _in situ_ at St.\r\nJohn, I am convinced that they cannot be plants, but must be markings of\r\nthe nature of _Rhabdichnites_. This conclusion is based on the absence of\r\ncarbonaceous matter, the intimate union of the markings with the surface\r\nof the stone, their indefinite forms, their want of nodes or appendages,\r\nand their markings being always of such a nature as could be produced by\r\nscratches of a sharp instrument. Since, however, fishes are yet unknown\r\nin beds of this age, they may possibly be referred to the feet or spinous\r\ntails of swimming crustaceans. Salter has already suggested this origin\r\nfor some scratches of somewhat different form found in the Primordial\r\nof Great Britain. He supposed them to have been the work of species of\r\n_Hymenocaris_. These marks may, however, indicate the existence of some\r\nfree-swimming animals of the Primordial seas as yet unknown to us.\r\n\r\nThree other suggestions merit consideration in this connection. One\r\nis that Algæ and also land-plants, drifting with tides or currents,\r\noften make the most remarkable and fantastic trails. A marking of this\r\nkind has been observed by Dr. G. M. Dawson to be produced by a drifted\r\nLaminaria, and in complexity it resembled the extraordinary _Ænigmichnus\r\nmultiformis_ of Hitchcock from the Connecticut sandstones. Much more\r\nsimple markings of this kind would suffice to give species of _Eophyton_.\r\nAnother is furnished by a fact stated to the author by Prof. Morse,\r\nnamely, that Lingulæ, when dislodged from their burrows, trail themselves\r\nover the bottom like worms, by means of their cirri. Colonies of these\r\ncreatures, so abundant in the Primordial, may, when obliged to remove,\r\nhave covered the surfaces of beds of mud with vermicular markings. The\r\nthird is that the Rhabdichnite-markings resemble some of the grooves in\r\nSilurian rocks which have been referred to trails of Gasteropods, as, for\r\ninstance, those from the Clinton group, described by Hall.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of markings not even organic, but altogether depending on\r\nphysical causes, are the beautiful branching rill-marks produced by the\r\noozing of water out of mud and sand-banks left by the tide, and which\r\nsometimes cover great surfaces with the most elaborate tracery, on\r\nthe modern tidal shores as well as in some of the most ancient rocks.\r\n_Dendrophycus_[V] of Lesquereux seems to be an example of rill-mark, as\r\nwell as _Aristophycus_, _Cloephycus_, and _Zygopliycus_, of Miller and\r\nDyer, from the Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n[V] \"Coal Flora of Pennsylvania,\" vol. iii., Plate 88.\r\n\r\nRill-marks occur in very old rocks,[W] but are perhaps most beautifully\r\npreserved in the Carboniferous shales and argillaceous sandstones, and\r\neven more elaborately on the modern mud-banks of the Bay of Fundy.[X]\r\nSome of these simulate ferns and fronds of Laminariæ, and others resemble\r\nroots, fucoids allied to _Buthotrephis_, or the radiating worm-burrows\r\nalready referred to (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n[W] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" vol. xii., p. 251.\r\n\r\n[X] \"Acadian Geology,\" 2d ed., p. 26.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Carboniferous rill-mark (Nova Scotia), reduced,\r\nto illustrate pretended Algæ.]\r\n\r\n_Shrinkage-cracks_ are also abundant in some of the Carboniferous beds,\r\nand are sometimes accompanied with impressions of rain-drops. When finely\r\nreticulated they might be mistaken for the venation of leaves, and,\r\nwhen complicated with little rill-marks tributary to their sides, they\r\nprecisely resemble the _Dictyolites_ of Hall from the Medina sandstone\r\n(Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Cast of shrinkage cracks (Carboniferous, Nova\r\nScotia), illustrating pretended Algæ.]\r\n\r\nAn entirely different kind of shrinkage-crack is that which occurs in\r\ncertain carbonised and flattened plants, and which sometimes communicates\r\nto them a marvellous resemblance to the netted under surface of an\r\nexogenous leaf. Flattened stems of plants and layers of cortical\r\nmatter, when carbonised, shrink in such a manner as to produce minute\r\nreticulated cracks. These become filled with mineral matter before the\r\ncoaly substance has been completely consolidated. A further compression\r\noccurs, causing the coaly substance to collapse, leaving the little veins\r\nof harder mineral matter projecting. These impress their form upon the\r\nclay or shale above and below, and thus when the mass is broken open we\r\nhave a carbonaceous film or thin layer covered with a network of raised\r\nlines, and corresponding minute depressed lines on the shale in contact\r\nwith it. The reticulations are generally irregular, but sometimes they\r\nvery closely resemble the veins of a reticulately veined leaf. One of\r\nthe most curious specimens in my possession was collected by Mr. Elder\r\nin the Lower Carboniferous of Horton Bluff. The little veins which form\r\nthe projecting network are in this case white calcite; but at the surface\r\ntheir projecting edges are blackened with a carbonaceous film.\r\n\r\n_Slickensided bodies_, resembling the fossil fruits described by Geinitz\r\nas _Gulielmites_, and the objects believed by Fleming and Carruthers[Y]\r\nto be casts of cavities filled with fluid, abound in the shales of the\r\nCarboniferous and Devonian. They are, no doubt, in most cases the results\r\nof the pressure and consolidation of the clay around small solid bodies,\r\nwhether organic, fragmentary, or concretionary. They are, in short, local\r\nslickensides precisely similar to those found so plentifully in the coal\r\nunder-clays, and which, as I have elsewhere[Z] shown, resulted from the\r\ninternal giving way and slipping of the mass as the roots of Stigmaria\r\ndecayed within it. Most collectors of fossil plants in the older\r\nformations must, I presume, be familiar with appearances of this kind in\r\nconnection with small stems, petioles, fragments of wood, and carpolites.\r\nI have in my collection petioles of ferns and fruits of the genus\r\nTrigonocarpum partially slickensided in this way, and which if wholly\r\ncovered by this kind of marking could scarcely have been recognised. I\r\nhave figured bodies of this kind in my report on the Devonian and Upper\r\nSilurian plants of Canada, believing them, owing to their carbonaceous\r\ncovering, to be probably slickensided fruits, though of uncertain nature.\r\nIn every case I think these bodies must have had a solid nucleus of\r\nsome sort, as the severe pressure implied in slickensiding is quite\r\nincompatible with a mere \"fluid-cavity,\" even supposing this to have\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n[Y] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" June, 1871.\r\n\r\n[Z] _Ibid._, vol. x., p. 14.\r\n\r\nProf. Marsh has well explained another phase of the influence of hard\r\nbodies in producing partial slickensides, in his paper on _Stylolites_,\r\nread before the American Association in 1867, and the application\r\nof the combined forces of concretionary action and slickensiding to\r\nthe production of the cone-in-cone concretions, which occur in the\r\ncoal-formation and as low as the Primordial. I have figured a very\r\nperfect and beautiful form of this kind from the coal-formation of Nova\r\nScotia, which is described in \"Acadian Geology\"[AA] (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\nI have referred to these facts here because they are relatively more\r\nimportant in that older period, which may be named the age of Algæ, and\r\nbecause their settlement now will enable us to dispense with discussions\r\nof this kind further on. The able memoirs of Nathorst and Williamson\r\nshould be studied by those who desire further information.\r\n\r\n[AA] Appendix, p. 676, edition of 1878.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Cone-in-cone concretion (Carboniferous, Nova\r\nScotia), illustrating pretended Algæ.]\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, \"Are there no real examples of fossil Algæ?\" I\r\nbelieve there are many such, but the difficulty is to distinguish them.\r\nConfining ourselves to the older rocks, the following may be noted:\r\n\r\nThe genus _Buthotrephis_ of Hall, which is characterised as having\r\nstems, sub-cylindric or compressed, with numerous branches, which are\r\ndivaricating and sometimes leaf-like, contains some true Algæ. Hall's\r\n_B. gracilis_, from the Siluro-Cambrian, is one of these. Similar\r\nplants, referred to the same species, occur in the Clinton and Niagara\r\nformations, and a beautiful species, collected by Col. Grant, of\r\nHamilton, and now in the McGill College collection, represents a broader\r\nand more frondose type of distinctly carbonaceous character. It may be\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\n_Buthotrephis Grantii_, S. N. (Fig. 13).--Stems and fronds smooth and\r\nslightly striate longitudinally, with curved and interrupted striæ.\r\nStem thick, bifurcating, the divisions terminating in irregularly\r\npinnate fronds, apparently truncate at the extremities. The quantity\r\nof carbonaceous matter present would indicate thick, though perhaps\r\nflattened, stems and dense fleshy fronds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--_Buthotrephis Grantii_, a genuine Alga from the\r\nSilurian, Canada.]\r\n\r\nThe species _Buthotrephis subnodosa_ and _B. flexuosa_, from the Utica\r\nshale, are also certainly plants, though it is possible, if their\r\nstructures and fruit were known, some of these might be referred to\r\ndifferent genera. All of these plants have either carbonaceous matter or\r\nproduce organic stains on the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe organism with diverging wedge-shaped fronds, described by Hall as\r\n_Sphenothallus angustifolius_, is also a plant. Fine specimens, in the\r\ncollection of the Geological Survey of Canada, show distinct evidence of\r\nthe organic character of the wedge-shaped fronds. It is from the Utica\r\nshale, and elsewhere in the Siluro-Cambrian. It is just possible, as\r\nsuggested by Hall, that this plant may be of higher rank than the Algæ.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Palæophycus_ of Hall includes a great variety of uncertain\r\nobjects, of which only a few are probably true Algæ. I have specimens of\r\nfragments similar to his _P. virgatus_, which show distinct carbonaceous\r\nfilms, and others from the Quebec group, which seem to be cylindrical\r\ntubes now flattened, and which have contained spindle-shaped sporangia\r\nof large size. Tortuous and curved flattened stems, or fronds, from the\r\nUpper Silurian limestone of Gaspé, also show organic matter.\r\n\r\nRespecting the forms referred to _Licrophycus_ by Billings, containing\r\nstems or semi-cylindrical markings springing from a common base, I have\r\nbeen in great doubt. I have not seen any specimens containing unequivocal\r\norganic matter, and am inclined to think that most of them, if not the\r\nwhole, are casts of worm-burrows, with trails radiating from them.\r\n\r\nThough I have confined myself in this notice to plants, or supposed\r\nplants, of the Lower Palæozoic, it may be well to mention the remarkable\r\nCauda-Galli fucoids, referred by Hall to the genus _Spirophyton_, and\r\nwhich are characteristic of the oldest Erian beds. The specimens which\r\nI have seen from New York, from Gaspé, and from Brazil, leave no doubt\r\nin my mind that these were really marine plants, and that the form of a\r\nspiral frond, assigned to them by Hall, is perfectly correct. They must\r\nhave been very abundant and very graceful plants of the early Erian,\r\nimmediately after the close of the Silurian period.\r\n\r\nWe come now to notice certain organisms referred to Algæ, and which are\r\neither of animal origin, or are of higher grade than the sea-weeds.\r\nWe have already discussed the questions relating to _Prototaxites_.\r\n_Drepanophycus_, of Goeppert,[AB] I suspect, is only a badly preserved\r\nbranch or stem of the Erian land-plant known as Arthrostigma. In like\r\nmanner, _Haliserites Dechenianus_,[AC] of Goeppert, is evidently\r\nthe land-plant known as _Psilophyton_. _Sphærococcites dentatus_\r\nand _S. serra_--the _Fucoides dentatus_ and _serra_ of Brongniart,\r\nfrom Quebec--are graptolites of two species quite common there.[AD]\r\n_Dictyophyton_ and _Uphantenia_, as described by Hall and the author, are\r\nnow known to be sponges. They have become _Dictyospongiæ_. The curious\r\nand very ancient; fossils referred by Forbes to the genus _Oldhamia_ are\r\nperhaps still subject to doubt, but are usually regarded as Zoöphytes,\r\nthough it is quite possible they may be plants. Though I have not seen\r\nthe specimens, I have no doubt whatever that the plants, or the greater\r\npart of them, from the Silurian of Bohemia, described by Stur as Algæ\r\nand Characeæ,[AE] are really land-plants, some of them of the genus\r\n_Psilophyton_. I may say in this connection that specimens of flattened\r\n_Psilophyton_ and _Arthrostigma_, in the Upper Silurian and Erian of\r\nGaspé, would probably have been referred to Algæ, but for the fact that\r\nin some of them the axis of barred vessels is preserved.\r\n\r\n[AB] \"Fossile Flora,\" 1852, p. 92, Table xli.\r\n\r\n[AC] _Ibid._, p. 88, Table ii.\r\n\r\n[AD] Brongniart, \"Vegeteaux Fossiles,\" Plate vi., Figs. 7 to 12.\r\n\r\n[AE] \"Proceedings of the Vienna Academy,\" 1881. _Hostinella_, of this\r\nauthor, is almost certainly _Psilophyton_, and his _Barrandiana_ seems to\r\ninclude _Arthrostigma_, and perhaps leafy branches of _Berwynia_. These\r\ncurious plants should be re-examined.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that great difficulties have occurred in the\r\ndetermination of fossil Algæ. Enough, however, remains certain to prove\r\nthat the old Cambrian and Silurian seas were tenanted with sea-weeds\r\nnot very dissimilar from those of the present time. It is further\r\nprobable that some of the graphitic, carbonaceous, and bituminous\r\nshales and limestones of the Silurian owe their carbonaceous matters\r\nto the decomposition of Algæ, though possibly some of it may have been\r\nderived from Graptolites and other corneous Zoöphytes. In any case,\r\nsuch microscopic examinations of these shales as I have made, have not\r\nproduced any evidence of the existence of plants of higher grade, while\r\nthose of the Erian and Carboniferous periods, similar to the naked eye,\r\nabound in such evidence. It is also to be observed that, on the surfaces\r\nof beds of sandstone in the Upper Cambrian, carbonaceous _débris_, which\r\nseems to be the remains of either aquatic or land plants, is locally not\r\ninfrequent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Silurian vegetation restored. _Protannularia_,\r\n_Berwynia_, _Nematophyton_, _Sphenophyllum_, _Arthrostigma_,\r\n_Psilophyton_.]\r\n\r\nReferring to the land vegetation of the older rocks, it is difficult to\r\npicture its nature and appearance. We may imagine the shallow waters\r\nfilled with aquatic or amphibious Rhizocarpean plants, vast meadows or\r\nbrakes of the delicate _Psilophyton_ and the starry _Protannularia_ and\r\nsome tall trees, perhaps looking like gigantic club-mosses, or possibly\r\nwith broad, flabby leaves, mostly cellular in texture, and resembling\r\nAlgæ transferred to the air. Imagination can, however, scarcely realise\r\nthis strange and grotesque vegetation, which, though possibly copious and\r\nluxuriant, must have been simple and monotonous in aspect, and, though it\r\nmust have produced spores and seeds and even fruits, these were probably\r\nall of the types seen in the modern acrogens and gymnosperms.\r\n\r\n  \"In garments green, indistinct in the twilight,\r\n  They stand like Druids of old, with voices sad and prophetic.\"\r\n\r\nProphetic they truly were, as we shall find, of the more varied forests\r\nof succeeding times, and they may also help us to realise the aspect\r\nof that still older vegetation, which is fossilised in the Laurentian\r\ngraphite; though it is not impossible that this last may have been of\r\nhigher and more varied types, and that the Cambrian and Silurian may have\r\nbeen times of depression in the vegetable world, as they certainly were\r\nin the submergence of much of the land.\r\n\r\nThese primeval woods served at least to clothe the nakedness of the\r\nnew-born land, and they may have sheltered and nourished forms of\r\nland-life still unknown to us, as we find as yet only a few insects and\r\nscorpions in the Silurian. They possibly also served to abstract from the\r\natmosphere some portion of its superabundant carbonic acid harmful to\r\nanimal life, and they stored up supplies of graphite, of petroleum, and\r\nof illuminating gas, useful to man at the present day. We may write of\r\nthem and draw their forms with, the carbon which they themselves supplied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nExamination of Prototaxites (_Nematophyton_), by Prof. Penhallow, of\r\nMcGill University.\r\n\r\nProf. Penhallow, having kindly consented to re-examine my specimens, has\r\nfurnished me with elaborate notes of his facts and conclusions, of which\r\nthe following is a summary, but which it is hoped will be published in\r\nfull:\r\n\r\n\"1. _Concentric Layers._--The inner face of each of these is composed\r\nof relatively large tubes, having diameters from 13·6 to 34·6\r\nmicro-millimetres. The outer face has tubes ranging from 13·8 to 27·6 mm.\r\nThe average diameter in the lower surface approaches to 34, that in the\r\nouter to 13·8. There is, however, no abrupt termination to the surface of\r\nthe layers, though in some specimens they separate easily, with shining\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\n\"2. _Minute Structure._--In longitudinal sections the principal part of\r\nthe structure consists of longitudinal tubes of indeterminate length,\r\nand round in cross-section. They are approximately parallel, but in some\r\ncases may be seen to bend sinuously, and are not in direct contact. Finer\r\nmyceloid tubes, 5·33 mm. in diameter, traverse the structure in all\r\ndirections, and are believed to branch off from the larger tubes. In a\r\nsmall specimen supposed to be a branch or small stem, and in which the\r\nvertical tubes are somewhat distant from one another, this horizontal\r\nsystem is very largely developed; but is less manifest in the older\r\nstems. The tubes themselves show no structure. The ray-like openings\r\nin the substance of the tissue are evidently original parts of the\r\nstructure, but not of the nature of medullary rays. They are radiating\r\nspaces running outward in an interrupted manner or so tortuously that\r\nthey appear to be interrupted in their course from the centre towards\r\nthe surface. They show tubes turning into them, branching into them,\r\nand approximately horizontal, but tortuous. On the external surface\r\nof some specimens these radial spaces are represented by minute pits\r\nirregularly or spirally arranged. The transverse swellings of the stem\r\nshow no difference of structure, except that the tubes or cells may be a\r\nlittle more tortuous, and a transverse film of coaly matter extends from\r\nthe outer coaly envelope inwardly. This may perhaps be caused by some\r\naccident of preservation. The outer coaly layer shows tubes similar to\r\nthose of the stem.[AF] The horizontal or oblique flexures of the large\r\ntubes seem to be mainly in the vicinity of the radial openings, and it is\r\nin entering these that they have been seen to branch.\"\r\n\r\n[AF] It is possible that these tubes may be merely part of the stem\r\nattached to the bark, which seems to me to indicate the same dense\r\ncellular structure seen in the bark of _Lepidodendra_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions arrived at by Prof. Penhallow are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. The plant was not truly exogenous, and the appearance of rings\r\nis independent of the causes which determine the layers of growth in\r\nexogenous plants.\r\n\r\n\"2. The plant was possessed of no true bark. Whatever cortical layer\r\nwas present was in all probability a modification of the general\r\nstructure,[AG]\r\n\r\n[AG] On these points I would reserve the considerations: 1. That there\r\nmust have been some relation between the mode of growth of these great\r\nstems and their concentric rings; and, 2. That the evidence of a bark is\r\nas strong as in the case of any Palæozoic tree in which the bark is, as\r\nusual, carbonised.\r\n\r\n\"3. An intimate relation exists between the large tubular cells and the\r\nmyceloid filaments, the latter being a system of small branches from\r\nthe former; the branching being determined chiefly in certain special\r\nopenings which simulate medullary rays.\r\n\r\n\"4. The specimens examined exhibit no evidence of special decay, and the\r\nstructure throughout is of a normal character.\r\n\r\n\"5. The primary structure consists of large tubular cells without\r\napparent terminations, and devoid of structural markings, with which is\r\nassociated a secondary structure of myceloid filaments arising from the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n\"6. The structure of _Nematophyton_ as a whole is unique; at least there\r\nis no plant of modern type with which it is comparable. Nevertheless, the\r\nloose character of the entire structure; the interminable cells; their\r\ninterlacing; and, finally, their branching into a secondary series of\r\nsmaller filaments, point with considerable force to the true relationship\r\nof the stem as being with Algæ or other Thallophytes rather than with\r\nGrymnosperms. A more recent examination of a laminated resinous\r\nsubstance found associated with the plant shows that it is wholly\r\namorphous, and, as indicated by distinct lines of flow, that it must\r\nhave been in a plastic state at a former period. The only evidence of\r\nstructure was found in certain well-defined mycelia, which may have been\r\nderived from associated vegetable matter upon which they were growing,\r\nand over which the plastic matrix flowed.\"\r\n\r\nI have only to add to this description that when we consider that\r\n_Nematophyton Logani_ was a large tree, sometimes attaining a diameter of\r\nmore than two feet, and a stature of at least twenty before branching;\r\nthat it had great roots, and gave off large branches; that it was\r\nan aërial plant, probably flourishing in the same swampy flats with\r\n_Psilophyton_, _Arthrostigma_, and _Leptophleum_; that the peculiar\r\nbodies known as Pachytheca were not unlikely its fruit--we have evidence\r\nthat there were, in the early Palæozoic period, plants scarcely dreamt\r\nof by modern botany. Only when the appendages of these plants are more\r\nfully known can we hope to understand them. In the mean time, I may state\r\nthat there were probably different species of these trees, indicated\r\nmore particularly by the stems I have described as _Nematoxylon_ and\r\n_Celluloxylon_[AH] There were, I think, some indications that the plants\r\ndescribed by Carruthers as _Berwynia_, may also be found to have been\r\ngenerically the same. The resinous matter mentioned by Prof. Penhallow is\r\nfound in great abundance in the beds containing _Nematophyton_, and must,\r\nI think, have been an exudation from its bark.\r\n\r\n[AH] \"Journal Geol. Society of London,\" 1863, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ERIAN OF DEVONIAN FORESTS--ORIGIN OF PETROLEUM--THE AGE OF ACROGENS\r\nAND GYMNOSPERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we were occupied with the comparatively few and\r\nobscure remains of plants entombed in the oldest geological formations.\r\nWe now ascend to a higher plane, that of the Erian or Devonian period, in\r\nwhich, for the first time, we find varied and widely distributed forests.\r\n\r\nThe growth of knowledge with respect to this flora has been somewhat\r\nrapid, and it may be interesting to note its principal stages, as\r\nan encouragement to the hope that we may yet learn something more\r\nsatisfactory respecting the older floras we have just discussed.\r\n\r\nIn Goeppert's memoir on the flora of the Silurian, Devonian, and Lower\r\nCarboniferous rocks, published in 1860,[AI] he enumerates twenty species\r\nas Silurian, but these are all admitted to be Algæ, and several of them\r\nare remains which may be fairly claimed by the zoologists as zoophytes,\r\nor trails of worms and mollusks. In the Lower Devonian he knows but six\r\nspecies, five of which are Algæ, and the remaining one a _Sigillaria_,\r\nbut this is of very doubtful nature. In the Middle Devonian he gives but\r\none species, a land-plant of the genus _Lepidodendron_. In the Upper\r\nDevonian the number rises to fifty-seven, of which all but seven are\r\nterrestrial plants, representing a large number of the genera occurring\r\nin the succeeding Carboniferous system.\r\n\r\n[AI] Jena, 1860.\r\n\r\nGoeppert does not include in his enumeration the plants from the\r\nDevonian of Gaspé, described by the author in 1859,[AJ] having seen only\r\nan abstract of the paper at the time of writing his memoir, nor does\r\nhe appear to have any knowledge of the plants of this age described\r\nby Lesquereux in Roger's \"Pennsylvania.\" These might have added ten\r\nor twelve species to his list, some of them probably from the Lower\r\nDevonian. It is further to be observed that a few additional species had\r\nalso been recognised by Peach in the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[AJ] \"Journal of the Geological Society of London,\" also \"Canadian\r\nNaturalist.\"\r\n\r\nBut from 1860 to the present time a rich harvest of specimens has\r\nbeen gathered from the Gaspé sandstones, from the shales of southern\r\nNew Brunswick, from the sandstones of Perry in Maine, and from the\r\nwide-spread Erian areas of New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Nearly\r\nall these specimens have passed through my hands, and I am now able\r\nto catalogue about a hundred species, representing more than thirty\r\ngenera, and including all the great types of vascular Cryptogams, the\r\nGymnosperms, and even one (still doubtful) Angiosperm. Many new forms\r\nhave also been described from the Devonian of Scotland and of the\r\nContinent of Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore describing these plants in detail, we may refer to North America\r\nfor illustration of the physical conditions of the time. In a physical\r\npoint of view the northern hemisphere presented a great change in the\r\nErian period. There were vast foldings of the crust of the earth, and\r\ngreat emissions of volcanic rock on both sides of the Atlantic. In North\r\nAmerica, while at one time the whole interior area of the continent, as\r\nfar north as the Great Lakes, was occupied by a vast inland sea, studded\r\nwith coral islands, the long Appalachian ridge had begun to assume,\r\nalong with the old Laurentian land, something of the form of our present\r\ncontinent, and on the margins of this Appalachian belt there were wide,\r\nswampy flats and shallow-water areas, which, under the mild climate that\r\nseems to have characterised this period, were admirably suited to nourish\r\na luxuriant vegetation. Under this mild climate, also, it would seem that\r\nnew forms of plants were first introduced in the far north, where the\r\nlong continuance of summer sunlight, along with great warm th, seems to\r\nhave aided in their introduction and early extension, and thence made\r\ntheir way to the southward, a process which, as Gray and others have\r\nshown, has also occurred in later geological times.\r\n\r\nThe America of this Erian age consisted during the greater part of the\r\nperiod of a more or less extensive belt of land in the north with two\r\nlong tongues descending from it, one along the Appalachian line in the\r\neast, the other in the region west of the Rocky Mountains. On the seaward\r\nsides of these there were low lands covered with vegetation, while on the\r\ninland side the great interior sea, with its verdant and wooded islands,\r\nrealised, though probably with shallower water, the conditions of the\r\nmodern archipelagoes of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nEurope presented conditions somewhat similar, having in the earlier and\r\nmiddle portions of the period great sea areas with insular patches of\r\nland, and later wide tracts of shallow and in part enclosed water areas,\r\nswarming with fishes, and having an abundant vegetation on their shores.\r\nThese were the conditions of the Eifel and Devonshire limestones, and of\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone of Scotland, and the Kiltorcan beds of Ireland. In\r\nEurope also, as in America, there were in the Erian age great ejections\r\nof igneous rock. On both sides of the Atlantic there were somewhat varied\r\nand changing conditions of land and water, and a mild and equable\r\nclimate, permitting the existence of a rich vegetation in high northern\r\nlatitudes. Of this latter fact a remarkable example is afforded by the\r\nbeds holding plants of this age in Spitzbergen and Bear Island, in its\r\nvicinity. Here there seem to be two series of plant-bearing strata,\r\none with the vegetation of the Upper Erian, the other with that of the\r\nLower Carboniferous, though both have been united by Heer under his\r\nso-called \"Ursa Stage\" in which he has grouped the characteristic plants\r\nof two distinct periods. This has recently been fully established by the\r\nresearches of Nathorst, though the author had already suggested it as the\r\nprobable explanation of the strange union of species in the Ursa group of\r\nHeer.\r\n\r\nIn studying the vegetation of this remarkable period, we must take\r\nmerely some of the more important forms as examples, since it would be\r\nimpossible to notice all the species, and some of them may be better\r\ntreated in the Carboniferous, where they have their headquarters. (Fig.\r\n15.)\r\n\r\nI may first refer to a family which seems to have culminated in the Erian\r\nage, and ever since to have occupied a less important place. It is that\r\nof the curious aquatic plants known as Rhizocarps,[AK] and referred to in\r\nthe last chapter.\r\n\r\n[AK] Or, as they have recently been named by some botanists,\r\n\"Heterosporous Filices,\" though they are certainly not ferns in any\r\nordinary sense of that term.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first directed to these organisms by the late Sir W.\r\nE. Logan in 1869. He had obtained from the Upper Erian shale of Kettle\r\nPoint, Lake Huron, specimens filled with minute circular discs, to which\r\nhe referred, in his report of 1863, as \"microscopic orbicular bodies.\"\r\nRecognising them to be macrospores, or spore-cases, I introduced them\r\ninto the report on the Erian flora, which I was then preparing, and\r\nwhich was published in 1871, under the name _Sporangites Huronensis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Vegetation of the Devonian period, restored.\r\n_Calamites_, _Psilophyton_, _Leptophleum_, _Lepidodendron_, _Cordaites_,\r\n_Sigillaria_, _Dadoxylon_, _Asterophyllites_, _Platyphyllum_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1871, having occasion to write a communication to the \"American\r\nJournal of Science\" on the question then raised as to the share of spores\r\nand spore-cases in the accumulation of coal, a question to be discussed\r\nin a subsequent chapter, these curious little bodies were again\r\nreviewed, and were described in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The oldest bed of spore-cases known to me is that at Kettle Point, Lake\r\nHuron. It is a bed of brown bituminous shale, burning with much flame,\r\nand under a lens is seen to be studded with flattened disc-like bodies,\r\nscarcely more than a hundredth of an inch in diameter, which under\r\nthe microscope are found to be spore-cases (or macrospores) slightly\r\npapillate externally (or more properly marked with dark pores), and\r\nsometimes showing a point of attachment on one side and a slit more or\r\nless elongated and gaping on the other. When slices of the rock are\r\nmade, its substance is seen to be filled with these bodies, which,\r\nviewed as transparent objects, appear yellow like amber, and show little\r\nstructure, except that the walls can be distinguished from the internal\r\ncavity, which may sometimes be seen to enclose patches of granular\r\nmatter. In the shale containing them are also vast numbers of rounded,\r\ntranslucent granules, which may be escaped spores (microspores).\" The\r\nbed containing these spores at Kettle Point was stated, in the reports\r\nof the \"Geological Survey of Canada,\" to be twelve or fourteen feet\r\nin thickness, and besides these specimens it contained fossil plants\r\nreferable to the species _Calamites inornatus_ and _Lepidodendron\r\nprimævum_, and I not unnaturally supposed that the Sporangites might\r\nbe the fruit of the latter plant. I also noticed their resemblance\r\nto the spore-cases of _L. corrugatum_ of the Lower Carboniferous (a\r\nLepidodendron allied to _L. primævum_), and to those from Brazil\r\ndescribed by Carruthers under the name _Flemingites_, as well as to those\r\ndescribed by Huxley from certain English coals, and to those of the\r\nTasmanite or white coal of Australia. The bed at Kettle Point is shown to\r\nbe marine by its holding the sea-weed known as _Spirophyton_, and shells\r\nof _Lingula_.\r\n\r\nThe subject did not again come under my notice till 1882, when Prof.\r\nOrton, of Columbus, Ohio, sent me some specimens from the Erian shales\r\nof that State, which on comparison seemed undistinguishable from\r\n_Sporangites Huronensis_.[AL] Prof. Orton read an interesting paper on\r\nthese bodies, at the meeting of the American Association in Montreal, in\r\nwhich were some new and striking facts. One of these was the occurrence\r\nof such bodies throughout the black shales of Ohio, extending \"from the\r\nHuron River, on the shore of Lake Brie, to the mouth of the Scioto, in\r\nthe Ohio Valley, with an extent varying from ten to twenty miles in\r\nbreadth,\" and estimated to be three hundred and fifty feet in thickness.\r\nI have since been informed by my friend Mr. Thomas, of Chicago, that its\r\nthickness, in some places at least, must be three times that amount.\r\nAbout the same time. Prof. Williams, of Cornell, and Prof. Clarke, of\r\nNorthampton, announced similar discoveries in the State of New York,\r\nso that it would appear that beds of vast area and of great thickness\r\nare replete with these little vegetable discs, usually converted into\r\na highly bituminous, amber-like substance, giving a more or less\r\ninflammable character to the containing rock.\r\n\r\n[AL] These shales have been described, as to their chemical and\r\ngeological relations, by Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, \"American Journal of\r\nScience,\" 1863, and by Dr. Newberry, in the \"Reports of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Ohio,\" vol. i., 1863, and vol. iii., 1878.\r\n\r\nAnother fact insisted on by Prof. Orton was the absence of Lepidodendroid\r\ncones, and the occurrence of filamentous vegetable matter, to which the\r\nSporangites seemed to be in some cases attached in groups. Prof. Orton\r\nalso noticed the absence of the trigonal form, which belongs to the\r\nspores of many Lepidodendra, though this is not a constant character. In\r\nthe discussion on Prof. Orton's paper, I admitted that the facts detailed\r\nby him shook my previous belief of the lycopodiaceous character of these\r\nbodies, and induced me to suspect, with Prof. Orton, that they might have\r\nbelonged to some group of aquatic plants lower than the Lycopods.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of my paper on Rhizocarps in the Palæozoic period\r\nabove referred to, I have received two papers from Mr. Edward Wethered,\r\nF. G. S., in one of which he describes spores of plants found in the\r\nlower limestone shales of the Forest of Dean, and in the other discusses\r\nmore generally the structure and origin of Carboniferous coal-beds.[AM]\r\nIn both papers he refers to the occurrence in these coals and shales of\r\norganisms essentially similar to the Erian spores.\r\n\r\n[AM] \"Cotteswold Naturalists' Field Club,\" 1884; \"Journal of the Royal\r\nMicroscopical Society,\" 1885.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Bulletin of the Chicago Academy of Science,\" January, 1884, Dr.\r\nJohnson and Mr. Thomas, in their paper on the \"Microscopic Organisms\r\nof the Boulder Clay of Chicago and Vicinity,\" notice _Sporangites\r\nHuronensis_ as among these organisms, and have discovered them also in\r\nlarge numbers in the precipitate from Chicago city water-supply. They\r\nrefer them to the decomposition of the Erian shales, of which boulders\r\nfilled with these organisms are of frequent occurrence in the Chicago\r\nclays. The Sporangites and their accompaniments in the boulder clay are\r\nnoticed in a paper by Dr. G. M. Dawson, in the \"Bulletin of the Chicago\r\nAcademy,\" June, 1885.\r\n\r\nProf. Clarke has also described, in the \"American Journal of Science\"\r\nfor April, 1885, the forms already alluded to, and which he finds to\r\nconsist of macrospores enclosed in sporocarps. He compares these with my\r\n_Sporangites Huronensis_ and _Protosalvinia bilobata_, but I think it is\r\nlikely that one of them at least is a distinct species.\r\n\r\nI may add that in the \"Geological Magazine\" for 1875, Mr. Newton, F.\r\nG. S., of the Geological Survey of England, published a description\r\nof the Tasmanite and Australian white coal, in which he shows that the\r\norganisms in these deposits are similar to my _Sporangites Huronensis_,\r\nand to the macrospores previously described by Prof. Huxley, from the\r\nBetter-bed coal. Mr. Newton does not seem to have been aware of my\r\nprevious description of _Sporangites_, and proposes the name _Tasmanites\r\npunctatus_ for the Australian form.\r\n\r\nHere we have the remarkable fact that the waste macrospores, or larger\r\nspores of a species of Cryptogamous plant, occur dispersed in countless\r\nmillions of tons through the shales of the Erian in Canada and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nNo certain clue seemed to be afforded by all these observations as to\r\nthe precise affinities of these widely distributed bodies; but this was\r\nfurnished shortly after from an unexpected quarter. In March, 1883, Mr.\r\nOrville Derby, of the Geological Survey of Brazil, sent me specimens\r\nfound in the Erian of that country, which seemed to throw a new light on\r\nthe whole subject. These I described and pointed out their connection\r\nwith _Sporangites_ at the meeting of the American Association at\r\nMinneapolis, in 1883, and subsequently published my notes respecting them\r\nin its proceedings, and in the \"Canadian Record of Science.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Derby's specimens contained the curious spiral sea-weed known as\r\n_Spirophyton_, and also minute rounded Sporangites like those obtained\r\nin the Erian of Ohio, and of which specimens had been sent to me some\r\nyears before by the late Prof. Hartt. But they differed in showing the\r\nremarkable fact that these rounded bodies are enclosed in considerable\r\nnumbers in spherical and oval sacs, the walls of which are composed of\r\na tissue of hexagonal cells, and which resemble in every respect the\r\ninvolucres or spore-sacs of the little group of modern acrogens known as\r\nRhizocarps, and living in shallow water. More especially they resemble\r\nthe sporocarps of the genus _Salvinia_. This fact opened up an entirely\r\nnew field of investigation, and I at once proceeded to compare the\r\nspecimens with the fructification of modern Rhizocarps, and found that\r\nsubstantially these multitudinous spores embedded in the Erie shales may\r\nbe regarded as perfectly analogous to the larger spores of the modern\r\n_Salvinia natans_ of Europe, as may be seen by the representation of them\r\nin Fig. 16.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--_Sporangites_ (_Protosalvinia_). A, _Sporangites\r\nBraziliensis_, natural size, AX, Same, magnified, B, _Sp. biloba_,\r\nnatural size, C, Detached macrospores. D, Spore-cases of Salvinia natans.\r\nDX, Same, magnified. E, Shale with sporangites, vertical section, highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nThe typical macrospores from the Erian shales are perfectly circular\r\nin outline, and in the flattened state appear as discs with rounded\r\nedges, their ordinary diameter being from one seventy-fifth to one\r\none-hundredth of an inch, though they vary considerably in size. This,\r\nhowever, I do not regard as an essential character. The edges, as seen\r\nin profile, are smooth, but the flat surface often presents minute dark\r\nspots, which at first I mistook for papillæ, but now agree with Mr.\r\nThomas in recognising them as minute pores traversing the wall of the\r\ndisc, and similar to those which Mr. Newton has described in Tasmanite,\r\nand which Mr. Wethered has also recognised in the similar spores of the\r\nForest of Dean shales. The walls also sometimes show faint indications\r\nof concentric lamination, as if they had been thickened by successive\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nAs seen by transmitted light, and either in front or in profile, the\r\ndiscs are of a rich amber colour, translucent and structureless, except\r\nthe pores above referred to. The walls are somewhat thick, or from\r\none-tenth to one-twentieth the diameter of the disc in thickness. They\r\nnever exhibit the triradiate marking seen in spores of Lycopods, nor\r\nany definite point of attachment, though they sometimes show a minute\r\nelongated spot which may be of this nature, and they are occasionally\r\nseen to have opened by slits on the edge or front, where there would seem\r\nto have been a natural line of dehiscence. The interior is usually quite\r\nvacant or structureless, but in some cases there are curved internal\r\nmarkings which may indicate a shrunken lining membrane, or the remains of\r\na prothallus or embryo. Occasionally a fine granular substance appears in\r\nthe interior, possibly remains of microspores.\r\n\r\nThe discs are usually detached and destitute of any envelope, but\r\nfragments of flocculent cellular matter are associated with them, and\r\nin one specimen from the corniferous limestone of Ohio, in Mr. Thomas's\r\ncollection, I have found a group of eight or more discs partly enclosed\r\nin a cellular sac-like membrane of similar character to that enclosing\r\nthe Brazilian specimens already referred to.\r\n\r\nThe characters of all the specimens are essentially similar, and\r\nthere is a remarkable absence of other organisms in the shale. In one\r\ninstance only, I have observed a somewhat smaller round body with a\r\ndark centre or nucleus, and a wide translucent margin, marked by a\r\nslight granulation. Even this, however, may indicate nothing more than a\r\ndifferent state of preservation.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to observe here that the wall or enclosing sac of these\r\nmacrospores must have been of very dense consistency, and now appears\r\nas a highly bituminous substance, in this agreeing with that of the\r\nspores of Lycopods, and, like them, having been when recent of a highly\r\ncarbonaceous and hydrogenous quality, very combustible and readily\r\nadmitting of change into bituminous matter. In the paper already referred\r\nto, on spore-cases in coals, I have noticed that the relative composition\r\nof lycopodium and cellulose is as follows:\r\n\r\nCellulose, C{24}H{20}O{20}.\r\n\r\nLycopodium, C{42}H{19-4/12}NO{5-6/10}.\r\n\r\nThus, such spores are admirably suited for the production of highly\r\ncarbonaceous or bituminous coals, etc.\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable in connection with these bodies than their\r\nuniformity of structure and form over so great areas and throughout so\r\ngreat thickness of rock, and the absence of any other kind of spore-case.\r\nThis is more especially noteworthy in contrast with the coarse coals and\r\nbituminous shales of the Carboniferous, which usually contain a great\r\nvariety of spores and sporangia, indicating the presence of many species\r\nof acrogenous plants, while the Erian shales, on the contrary, indicate\r\nthe almost exclusive predominance of one form. This contrast is well\r\nseen in the Bedford shales overlying these beds, and I believe Lower\r\nCarboniferous.[AN] Specimens of these have been kindly communicated to me\r\nby Prof. Orton, and have been prepared by Mr. Thomas. In these we see the\r\nfamiliar Carboniferous spores with triradiate markings called _Triletes_\r\nby Reinsch, and which are similar to those of Lycopodiaceous plants.\r\nStill more abundant are those spinous and hooked spores or sporangia,\r\nto which the names _Sporocarpon_, _Zygosporites_, and _Traquaria_ have\r\nbeen given, and some of which Williamson has shown to be spores of\r\nLycopodiaceous plants.[AO]\r\n\r\n[AN] According to Newberry, lower part of Waverly group.\r\n\r\n[AO] _Traquaria_ is to be distinguished from the calcareous bodies found\r\nin the corniferous limestone of Kelly's Island, which I have described\r\nin the \"Canadian Naturalist\" as _Saccamina Eriana_, and believe to be\r\nForaminiferal tests. They have since been described by Ulrich under a\r\ndifferent name (_Moellerina_: contribution to \"American Palæontology,\"\r\n1886). See Dr. Williamson's papers in \"Transactions of Royal Society of\r\nLondon.\"\r\n\r\nThe true \"Sporangites,\" on the contrary, are round and smooth, with thick\r\nbituminous walls, which are punctured with minute transverse pores. In\r\nthese respects, as already stated, they closely resemble the bodies found\r\nin the Australian white coal and Tasmanite. The precise geological age of\r\nthis last material is not known with certainty, but it is believed to be\r\nPalæozoic.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the mode of occurrence of these bodies, we may note\r\nfirst their great abundance and wide distribution. The horizontal range\r\nof the bed at Kettle Point is not certainly known, but it is merely a\r\nnorthern outlier of the great belt of Erian shales referred to by Prof.\r\nOrton, and which extends, with a breadth of ten to twenty miles, and of\r\ngreat thickness, across the State of Ohio, for nearly two hundred miles.\r\nThis Ohio black shale, which lies at the top of the Erian or the base of\r\nthe Carboniferous, though probably mainly of Erian age, appears to abound\r\nthroughout in these organisms, and in some beds to be replete with them.\r\nIn like manner, in Brazil, according to Mr. Derby, these organisms are\r\ndistributed over a wide area and throughout a great thickness of shale\r\nholding _Spirophyton_, and apparently belonging to the Upper Erian. The\r\nrecurrence of similar forms in the Tasmanite and white coal of Tasmania\r\nand Australia is another important fact of distribution. To this we\r\nmay add the appearance of these macrospores in coals and shales of the\r\nCarboniferous period, though there in association with other forms.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed that the Erian shales, and the Forest of Dean\r\nbeds described by Wethered, are marine, as shown by their contained\r\nfossils; and, though I have no certain information as to the Tasmanite\r\nand Australian white coal, they would seem, from the description of\r\nMilligan, to occur in distinctly aqueous, possibly estuarine, deposits.\r\nWethered has shown that the discs described by Huxley and Newton in\r\nthe Better-bed coal occur in the earthy or fragmentary layers, as\r\ndistinguished from the pure coal. Those occurring in cannel coal are\r\nin the same case, so that the general mode of occurrence implies\r\nwater-driftage, since, in the case of bodies so large and dense,\r\nwind-driftage to great distances would be impossible.\r\n\r\nThese facts, taken in connection with the differences between these\r\nmacrospores and those of any known land-plant of the Palæozoic, would\r\nlead to the inference that they belonged to aquatic plants, and these\r\nvastly abundant in the waters of the Erian and Carboniferous periods.\r\n\r\nIt is still further to be observed that they are not, in the Erian beds,\r\naccompanied with any remains of woody or scalariform tissues, such\r\nas might be expected in connection with the _débris_ of terrestrial\r\nacrogens, and that, on the other hand, we find them enclosed in cellular\r\nsporocarps, though in the majority of cases these have been removed by\r\ndehiscence or decay.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, I think, all point to the probability which I\r\nhave suggested in my papers on this subject referred to above, that we\r\nhave in these objects the organs of fructification of plants belonging\r\nto the order _Rhizocarpeæ_, or akin to it. The comparisons which I have\r\ninstituted with the sporocarps and macrospores of these plants confirm\r\nthis suggestion. Of the modern species which I have had an opportunity\r\nto examine, _Salvinia natans_ of Europe perhaps presents the closest\r\nresemblance. In this plant groups of round cellular sporocarps appear\r\nat the bases of the floating fronds. They are about a line in diameter\r\nwhen mature, and are of two kinds, one containing macrospores, the\r\nother microspores or antheridia. The first, when mature, hold a number\r\nof closely packed globular or oval sporangia of loose cellular tissue,\r\nattached to a central placenta. Each of these sporangia contains a single\r\nmacrospore, perfectly globular and smooth, with a dense outer membrane\r\n(exhibiting traces of lamination, and showing within an irregularly\r\nvacuolated or cellular structure, probably a prothallus). I cannot detect\r\nin it the peculiar pores which appear in the fossil specimens. Each\r\nmacrospore is about one-seventieth of an inch in diameter when mature.\r\nThe sporocarps of the microspores contain a vastly greater number of\r\nminute sporangia, about one two-hundredths of an inch in diameter. These\r\ncontain disc-like antheridia, or microspores of very minute size.\r\n\r\nThe discs from Kettle Point and from the Ohio black shale, and from the\r\nshale boulders of the Chicago clays, are similar to the macrospores of\r\n_Salvinia_, except that they have a thicker wall and are a little less in\r\ndiameter, being about one-eightieth of an inch. The Brazilian sporocarps\r\nare considerably larger than those of the modern _Salvinia_, and the\r\nmacrospores approach in size to those of the modern species, being one\r\nseventy-fifth of an inch in diameter. They also seem, like the modern\r\nspecies, to have thinner walls than those from Canada, Ohio, and Chicago.\r\nNo distinct indication has been observed in the fossil species of the\r\ninner Sporangium of _Salvinia_. Possibly it was altogether absent, but\r\nmore probably it is not preserved as a distinct structure.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the microspores of _Salvinia_, it is to be observed\r\nthat the sporocarps, and the contained spores or antheridia, are very\r\ndelicate and destitute of the dense outer wall of the macrospores.\r\nHence such parts are little likely to have been preserved in a fossil\r\nstate; and in the Erian shales, if present, they probably appear merely\r\nas flocculent carbonaceous matter not distinctly marked, or as minute\r\ngranules not well defined, of which there are great quantities in some of\r\nthe shales.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation appertaining to the Sporangites has not been distinctly\r\nrecognised. I have, however, found in one of the Brazilian specimens two\r\nsporocarps attached to what seems a fragment of a cellular frond, and\r\nnumerous specimens of the supposed Algæ, named _Spirophyton_, are found\r\nin the shales, but there is no evidence of any connection of this plant\r\nwith the _Protosalvinia_.\r\n\r\nModern Rhizocarps present considerable differences as to their vegetative\r\nparts. Some, like _Pilularia_, have simple linear leaves; others, like\r\n_Marsilea_, have leaves in whorls, and cuneate in form; while others,\r\nlike _Azolla_ and _Salvinia_, have frondose leaves, more or less pinnate\r\nin their arrangement. If we inquire as to fossils representing these\r\nforms of vegetation, we shall find that some of the plants to be noticed\r\nin the immediate sequel may have been nearly allied to the Rhizocarps.\r\nIn the mean time I may state that I have proposed the generic name\r\n_Protosalvinia_ for these curious macrospores and their coverings, and\r\nhave described in the paper in the \"Bulletin of the Chicago Academy of\r\nSciences,\" already quoted, five species which may be referred to this\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\nThese facts lead to inquiries as to the origin of the bituminous matter\r\nwhich naturally escapes from the rocks of the earth as petroleum and\r\ninflammable gas, or which may be obtained from certain shales in\r\nthese forms by distillation. These products are compounds of carbon\r\nand hydrogen, and may be procured from recent vegetable substances by\r\ndestructive distillation. Some vegetable matters, also, are much richer\r\nin carbon and hydrogen than others, and it is a remarkable fact that\r\nthe spores of certain cryptogamous plants are of this kind, as we see in\r\nthe inflammable character of the dry spores of Lycopodium; and we know\r\nthat the slow putrefaction of such material underground effects chemical\r\nchanges by which bituminous matter can be produced. There is, therefore,\r\nnothing unreasonable in the supposition advanced by Prof. Orton, that the\r\nspores so abundantly contained in the Ohio black shales are important\r\nor principal sources of the bituminous matter which they contain.\r\nMicroscopic sections of this shale show that much of its material\r\nconsists of the rich bituminous matter of these spores (Fig. 16). At the\r\nsame time, while we may trace the bitumen of these shales, and of some\r\nbeds of coal, to this cause, we must bear in mind that there are other\r\nkinds of bituminous rocks which show no such structures, and may have\r\nderived their combustible material from other kinds of vegetable matter,\r\nwhether of marine or of land plants. We shall better understand this when\r\nwe have considered the origin of coal.\r\n\r\nThe macrospores above referred to may have belonged to humble aquatic\r\nplants mantling the surfaces of water or growing up from the bottom, and\r\npresenting little aërial vegetation. But there are other Erian plants,\r\nas already mentioned, which, while of higher structure, may be of\r\nRhizocarpean affinities.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the beautiful plant with whorls of wedge-shaped leaves,\r\nto which the name _Sphenophyllum_ (see Fig. 20) has been given. Plants\r\nreferred to this genus have been described by Lesquereux from the upper\r\npart of the Siluro-Cambrian,[AP] and a beautiful little species occurs\r\nin the Erian shales of St. John, New Brunswick.[AQ] The genus is also\r\ncontinued, and is still more abundant, in the Carboniferous. Many years\r\nago I observed, in a beautiful specimen collected by Sir W. E. Logan, in\r\nNew Brunswick, that the stem of this plant had an axis of reticulated and\r\nscalariform vessels, and an outer bark.[AR] Renault and Williamson have\r\nmore recently obtained more perfect specimens, and the former has figured\r\na remarkably complex triangular axis, containing punctate and barred\r\nvessels, and larger punctate vessels filling in its angles. Outside of\r\nthis there is a cellular inner bark, and this is surrounded by a thick\r\nfibrous envelope. That a structure so complex should belong to a plant so\r\nhumble in its affinities is one of the strange anomalies presented by the\r\nold world, and of which we shall find many similar instances. The fruit\r\nof _Sphenophyllum_ was borne in spikes, with little whorls of bracts or\r\nrudimentary leaves bearing round sporocarps.\r\n\r\n[AP] \"American Journal of Science.\"\r\n\r\n[AQ] Dawson, \"Report on Devonian Plants,\" 1870.\r\n\r\n[AR] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" 1865.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--_Ptilophyton plumosum_ (Lower Carboniferous,\r\nNova Scotia). Natural size and magnified.]\r\n\r\nA second type of plant, which may have been Rhizocarpean in its\r\naffinities, is that to which I have given the name _Ptilophyton_.[AS]\r\nIt consists of beautiful feathery fronds, apparently bearing on parts\r\nof the main stem or petiole small rounded sporocarps. They are found\r\nabundantly in the Middle Erian of the State of New York, and also occur\r\nin Scotland, while one species appears to occur in Nova Scotia, as high\r\nas the Lower Carboniferous (Figs. 17, 18).\r\n\r\n[AS] _Plumalina_ of Hall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--_Ptilophyton Thomsoni_ (Scotland), _a_,\r\nImpression of plant in vernation, _b_, Branches conjecturally restored,\r\n_c_, Branches of _Lycopodites Milleri_, on same slab.]\r\n\r\nThese organisms have been variously referred to Lycopods, to Algæ, or to\r\nZoöphytes, but an extended comparison of American and Scottish specimens\r\nhas led me to the belief that they were aquatic plants, more likely to\r\nhave been allied to Rhizocarps than to any other group. Some evidence of\r\nthis will be given in a note appended to this chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--_Psilophyton princeps_, restored (Lower\r\nErian, Gaspé). _a_, Fruit, natural size. _b_, stem, natural size, _c_,\r\nScalariform tissue of the axis, highly magnified. In the restoration, one\r\nside is represented in vernation and the other in fruit.]\r\n\r\nAnother genus, which I have named _Psilophyton_[AT] (Figs. 19, 21), may\r\nbe regarded as a connecting link between the Rhizocarps and the Lycopods.\r\nIt is so named from its resemblance, in some respects, to the curious\r\nparasitic Lycopods placed in the modern genus _Psilotum_. Several species\r\nhave been described, and they are eminently characteristic of the Lower\r\nErian, in which they were first discovered in Gaspé. The typical species,\r\n_Psilophyton princeps_, which fills many beds of shale and sandstone in\r\nGaspé Bay and the head of the neighbouring Bay des Chaleurs with its\r\nslender stems and creeping, cord-like rhizomes, may be thus described:\r\n\r\n[AT] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" vols, xv., xviii., and xix.,\r\n\"Report on Devonian Plants of Canada,\" 1871.\r\n\r\nStems branching dichotomously, and covered with interrupted ridges.\r\nLeaves rudimentary, or short, rigid, and pointed; in barren stems,\r\nnumerous and spirally arranged; in fertile stems and branchlets, sparsely\r\nscattered or absent; in decorticated specimens, represented by a minute\r\npunctate scars. Young branches circinate; rhizomata cylindrical, covered\r\nwith hairs or ramenta, and having circular areoles irregularly disposed,\r\ngiving origin to slender cylindrical rootlets. Internal structure--an\r\naxis of scalariform vessels, surrounded by a cylinder of parenchymatous\r\ncells, and by an outer cylinder of elongated woody cells. Fructification\r\nconsisting of naked oval spore-cases, borne usually in pairs on slender,\r\ncurved pedicels, either lateral or terminal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--_Sphenophyllum antiquum_ (Erian, New\r\nBrunswick). See pp. 61, 67.]\r\n\r\nThis species was fully described by me in the papers referred to above,\r\nfrom specimens obtained from the rich exposures at Gaspé Bay, and which\r\nenabled me to illustrate its parts more fully, perhaps, than those of any\r\nother species of so great antiquity. In the specimens I had obtained I\r\nwas able to recognise the forms of the rhizomata, stems, branches, and\r\nrudimentary leaves, and also the internal structure of the stems and\r\nrhizomata, and to illustrate the remarkable resemblance of the forms and\r\nstructures to those of the modern _Psilotum_. The fructification was,\r\nhowever, altogether peculiar, consisting of narrowly ovate sporangia,\r\nborne usually in pairs, on curved and apparently rigid petioles. Under\r\nthe microscope these sporangia show indications of cellular structure,\r\nand appear to have been membranous in character. In some specimens\r\ndehiscence appears to have taken place by a slit in one side, and, clay\r\nhaving entered into the interior, both walls of the spore-case can be\r\nseen. In other instances, being flattened, they might be mistaken for\r\nscales. No spores could be observed in any of the specimens, though in\r\nsome the surface was marked by slight, rounded prominences, possibly the\r\nimpressions of the spores within. This peculiar and very simple style\r\nof spore-case is also characteristic of other species, and gives to\r\n_Psilophyton_ a very distinct generic character. These naked spore-cases\r\nmay be compared to those of such lycopodiaceous plants as _Psilotum_,\r\nin which the scales are rudimentary. They also bear some resemblance,\r\nthough on a much larger scale, to the spore-cases of some Erian ferns\r\n(_Archæopteris_), to be mentioned in the sequel. On the whole, however,\r\nthey seem most nearly related to the sporocarps of the Rhizocarpeæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--_Lepidodendron_ and _Psilophyton_ (Erian, New\r\nBrunswick). A, _Lepidodendron Gaspianum_. B, C, _Psilophyton elegans_.]\r\n\r\n_Arthrostigma_, which is found in the same beds with Psilophyton, was a\r\nplant of more robust growth, with better-developed, narrow, and pointed\r\nleaves, borne in a verticillate or spiral manner, and bearing at the\r\nends of its branches spikes of naked sporocarps, apparently similar to\r\nthose of _Psilophyton_ but more rounded in form. The two genera must\r\nhave been nearly related, and the slender branchlets of _Arthrostigma_\r\nare, unless well preserved, scarcely distinguishable from the stems of\r\n_Psilophyton_.[AU]\r\n\r\n[AU] Reports of the author on \"Devonian Plants,\" \"Geological Survey of\r\nCanada,\" which see for details as to Erian Flora of northeastern America.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we compare the vegetation of these and similar ancient plants\r\nwith that of modern Rhizocarps, we shall find that the latter still\r\npresent, though in a depauperated and diminished form, some of the\r\ncharacteristics of their predecessors. Some, like _Pilularia_, have\r\nsimple linear leaves; others, like _Marsilea_, have leaves in verticils\r\nand cuneate in form; while others, like Azolla and Salvinia, have\r\nfrondose leaves, more or less pinnate in their arrangement. The first\r\ntype presents little that is characteristic, but there are in the\r\nErian sandstones and shales great quantities of filamentous and linear\r\nobjects which it has been impossible to refer to any genus, and which\r\nmight have belonged to plants of the type of _Pilularia_. It is quite\r\npossible, also, that such plants as _Psilophyton glabrum_ and _Cordaites\r\nangustifolia_, of which the fructification is quite unknown, may have\r\nbeen allied to Rhizocarps. With regard to the verticillate type, we are\r\nat once reminded of _Sphenophyllum_ (Fig. 20), which many palæobotanists\r\nhave referred to the _Marsiliacæ_, though, like other Palæozoic Acrogens,\r\nit presents complexities not seen in its modern representatives. _S.\r\nprimævum_ of Lesquereux is found in the Hudson River group, and my\r\n_S. antiquum_ in the Middle Erian. Besides these, there are in the\r\nSilurian and Erian beds plants with verticillate leaves which have\r\nbeen placed with the Annulariæ, but which may have differed from them\r\nin fructification. _Annularia laxa_, of the Erian, and _Protannularia\r\nHarknessii_, of the Siluro-Cambrian, may be given as examples, and must\r\nhave been aquatic plants, probably allied to Rhizocarps. It is deserving\r\nof notice, also, that the two best-known species of _Psilophyton_\r\n(_P. princeps_ and _P. robustius_), while allied to Lycopods by the\r\nstructure of the stem and such rudimentary foliage as they possess, are\r\nalso allied, by the form of their fructification, to the Rhizocarps,\r\nand not to ferns, as some palæobotanists have incorrectly supposed. A\r\nsimilar remark applies to _Arthrostigma_; and the beautiful pinnately\r\nleaved _Ptilophyton_ may be taken to represent that type of foliage as\r\nseen in modern Rhizocarps, while the allied forms of the Carboniferous\r\nwhich Lesquereux has named _Trochophyllum_, seem to have had sporocarps\r\nattached to the stem in the manner of _Azolla_.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this evidence, I think, goes to show that in the Erian\r\nperiod there were vast quantities of aquatic plants, allied to the modern\r\nRhizocarps, and that the so-called _Sporangites_ referred to in this\r\npaper were probably the drifted sporocarps and macrospores of some of\r\nthese plants, or of plants allied to them in structure and habit, of\r\nwhich the vegetative organs have perished. I have shown that in the Erian\r\nperiod there were vast swampy flats covered with _Psilophyton_, and in\r\nsimilar submerged tracts near to the sea the _Protosalvinia_ may have\r\nfilled the waters and have given off the vast multitudes of macrospores\r\nwhich, drifted by currents, have settled in the mud of the black shales.\r\nWe have thus a remarkable example of a group of plants reduced in modern\r\ntimes to a few insignificant forms, but which played a great role in the\r\nancient Palæozoic world.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Rhizocarps, we may now turn to certain other families of\r\nErian plants. The first to attract our attention in this age would\r\nnaturally be the Lycopods, the club-mosses or ground-pines, which in\r\nCanada and the Eastern States carpet the ground in many parts of our\r\nwoods, and are so available for the winter decoration of our houses\r\nand public buildings. If we fancy one of these humble but graceful\r\nplants enlarged to the dimensions of a tree, we shall have an idea of\r\na _Lepidodendron_, or of any of its allies (Figs. 15, 21). These large\r\nlycopodiaceous trees, which in different specific and generic forms were\r\nprobably dominant in the Erian woods, resembled in general those of\r\nmodern times in their fruit and foliage, except that their cones were\r\nlarge, and probably in most cases with two kinds of spores, and their\r\nleaves were also often very long, thus bearing a due proportion to the\r\ntrees which they clothed. Their thick stems required, however, more\r\nstrength than is necessary in their diminutive successors, and to meet\r\nthis want some remarkable structures were introduced similar to those\r\nnow found only in the stems of plants of higher rank. The cells and\r\nvessels of all plants consist of thin walls of woody matter, enclosing\r\nthe sap and other contents of these sacs and tubes, and when strength is\r\nrequired it is obtained by lining their interior with successive coats\r\nof the hardest form of woody matter, usually known as lignin. But while\r\nthe walls remain thin, they afford free passage to the sap to nourish\r\nevery part. If thickened all over, they would become impervious to sap,\r\nand therefore unsuited to one of their most important functions. These\r\ntwo ends of strength and permeability are secured by partial linings of\r\nlignin, leaving portions of the original wall uncovered. But this may be\r\ndone in a great variety of ways.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient of these contrivances, and one still continued in the\r\nworld of plants, is that of the barred or scalariform vessel. This may\r\nbe either square or hexagonal, so as to admit of being packed without\r\nleaving vacancies. It is strengthened by a thick bar of ligneous matter\r\nup each angle, and these are connected by cross-bars so as to form a\r\nframework resembling several ladders fastened together. Hence the name\r\n_scalariform_, or ladder-like. Now, in a modern Lycopod there is a\r\ncentral axis of such barred vessels associated with simpler fibres or\r\nelongated cells. Even in _Sphenophyllum_ and _Psilophyton_, already\r\nreferred to as allied to Rhizocarps,[AV] there is such a central axis,\r\nand in the former rigidity is given to this by the vascular and woody\r\nelements being arranged in the form of a three-sided prism or three-rayed\r\nstar. But such arrangements would not suffice for a tree, and hence\r\nin the arboreal Lycopods of the Erian age a more complex structure is\r\nintroduced. The barred vessels were expanded in the first instance into\r\na hollow cylinder filled in with pith or cellular tissue, and the outer\r\nrind was strengthened with greatly thickened cells. But even this was not\r\nsufficient, and in the older stems wedge-shaped bundles of barred tissue\r\nwere run out from the interior, forming an external woody cylinder, and\r\ninside of the rind were placed bundles of tough bast fibres. Thus, a stem\r\nwas constructed having pith, wood, and bark, and capable of additions to\r\nthe exterior of the woody wedges by a true exogenous growth. The plan\r\nis, in short, the same with that of the stems of the exogenous trees of\r\nmodern times, except that the tissues employed are less complicated.\r\nThe structures of these remarkable trees, and the manner in which\r\nthey anticipate those of the true exogens of modern times, have been\r\nadmirably illustrated by Dr. Williamson, of Manchester. His papers, it\r\nis true, refer to these plants as existing in the Carboniferous age, but\r\nthere is every reason to believe that they were of the same character\r\nin the Erian. The plan is the same with that now seen in the stems of\r\nexogenous phænogams, and which has long ceased to be used in those of the\r\nLycopods. In this way, however, large and graceful lycopodiaceous trees\r\nwere constructed in the Erian period, and constituted the staple of its\r\nforests.\r\n\r\n[AV] First noticed by the author, \"Journal of Geological Society,\" 1865;\r\nbut more completely by Renault, \"Comptes Rendus,\" 1870.\r\n\r\nThe roots of these trees were equally remarkable with their stems, and\r\nso dissimilar to any now existing that botanists were long disposed to\r\nregard them as independent plants rather than roots. They were similar\r\nin general structure to the stems to which they belonged, but are\r\nremarkable for branching in a very regular manner by bifurcation like\r\nthe stems above, and for the fact that their long, cylindrical rootlets\r\nwere arranged in a spiral manner and distinctly articulated to the root\r\nafter the manner of leaves rather than of rootlets, and fitting them for\r\ngrowing in homogeneous mud or vegetable muck. They are the so-called\r\n_Stigmaria_ roots, which, though found in the Erian and belonging to\r\nits lycopodiaceous plants, attained to far greater importance in the\r\nCarboniferous period, where we shall meet with them again.\r\n\r\nThere were different types of lycopodiaceous plants in the Erian. In\r\naddition to humble Lycopods like those of our modern woods and great\r\nLepidodendra, which were exaggerated Lycopods, there were thick-stemmed\r\nand less graceful species with broad rhombic scars (_Leptophleum_), and\r\nothers with the leaf-scars in vertical rows (_Sigillaria_), and others,\r\nagain, with rounded leaf-scars, looking like the marks on Stigmaria, and\r\nbelonging to the genus _Cyclostigma_. Thus some variety was given to the\r\narboreal club-mosses of these early forests. (See Fig. 15.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Erian ferns (New Brunswick), A, _Aneimites\r\nobtusa_. C, _Neuropteris polymorpha_. F, _Sphenopteris pilosa_. N,\r\n_Hymenophyllites subfurcatus_.]\r\n\r\nAnother group of plants which attained to great development in the Erian\r\nage is that of the Ferns or Brackens. The oldest of these yet known\r\nare found in the Middle Erian. The _Eopteris_ of Saporta, from the\r\nSilurian, at one time supposed to carry this type much further back,\r\nhas unfortunately been found to be a mere imitative form, consisting of\r\nfilms of pyrites of leaf-like shapes, and produced by crystallisation.\r\nIn the Middle Erian, however, more especially in North America, many\r\nspecies have been found (Figs. 22 to 24).[AW] I have myself recorded\r\nmore than thirty species from the Middle Erian of Canada, and these\r\nbelong to several of the genera found in the Carboniferous, though\r\nsome are peculiar to the Erian. Of the latter, the best known are\r\nperhaps those of the genus _Archæopteris_ (Fig. 24), so abundant in the\r\nplant-beds of Kiltorcan in Ireland, as well as in North America. In this\r\ngenus the fronds are large and luxuriant, with broad obovate pinnules\r\ndecurrent, on the leaf-stalk, and with simple sac-like spore-cases\r\nborne on modified pinnæ. Another very beautiful fern found with\r\n_Archæopteris_ is that which I have named _Platyphyllum_, and which grew\r\non a creeping stem or parasitically on stems of other plants, and had\r\nmarginal fructification.[AX] Another very remarkable fern, which some\r\nbotanists have supposed may belong to a higher group than the ferns, is\r\nMegalopteris (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\n[AW] For descriptions of these ferns, see reports cited above.\r\n\r\n[AX] \"Reports on Fossil Plants of the Devonian and Upper Silurian of\r\nCanada,\" 1871, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Erian ferns (New Brunswick), B, _Cyclopteris\r\nvalida_, and pinnule enlarged, D, _Sphenopteris marginata_, and portion\r\nenlarged.

(From a specimen from Gilboa, New York.)]\r\n\r\nSome of the Erian ferns attained to the dimensions of tree-ferns. Large\r\nstems of these, which must have floated out far from land, have been\r\nfound by Newberry in the marine limestone of Ohio (_Caulopteris antiqua_\r\nand _C. peregrina_, Newberry),[AY] and Prof. Hall has found in the Upper\r\nDevonian of Gilboa, New York, the remains of a forest of tree-ferns\r\nstanding _in situ_ with their great masses of aërial roots attached to\r\nthe soil in which they grew (_Caulopteris Lockwoodi_, Dn.).[AZ]\r\n\r\n[AY] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" 1871.\r\n\r\n[AZ] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--_Megalopteris Dawsoni_, Hartt (Erian, New\r\nBrunswick), _a_, Fragment of pinna. _b_, Point of pinnule, _c_, Venation,\r\n(The midrib is not accurately given in this figure.)]\r\n\r\nThese aërial roots introduce us to a new contrivance for strengthening\r\nthe stems of plants by sending out into the soil multitudes of cord-like\r\ncylindrical roots from various heights on the stem, and which form\r\na series of stays like the cordage of a ship. This method of support\r\nstill continues in the modern tree-ferns of the tropics and the southern\r\nhemisphere. In one kind of tree-fern stem from the Erian of New York,\r\nthere is also a special arrangement for support, consisting of a\r\nseries of peculiarly arranged radiating plates of scalariform vessels,\r\nnot exactly like those of an exogenous stem, but doing duty for it\r\n(_Asteropteris_)[BA] Similar plants have been described from the Erian of\r\nFalkenberg, in Germany, and of Saalfeld, in Thuringia, by Goeppert and\r\nUnger, and are referred to ferns by the former, but treated as doubtful\r\nby the latter,[BB] This peculiar type of tree-fern is apparently a\r\nprecursor of the more exogenous type of _Heterangium_, recently described\r\nand referred to ferns by Williamson. Here, again, we have a mechanical\r\ncontrivance now restricted to higher plants appropriated by these old\r\ncryptogams.\r\n\r\n[BA] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" London, 1881.\r\n\r\n[BB] \"Sphenopteris Refracta,\" Goeppert; \"Flora des Uebergangsgebirges.\"\r\n\"Cladoxylon Mirabile,\" Unger; \"Palæontologie des Thuringer Waldes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--_Calamites radiatus_ (Erian, New Brunswick).]\r\n\r\nThe history of the ferns in geological time is remarkably different\r\nfrom that of the Lycopods; for while the latter have long ago descended\r\nfrom their pristine eminence to a very humble place in nature, the\r\nformer still, in the southern hemisphere at least, retain their arboreal\r\ndimensions and ancient dominance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Asterophyllites (Erian, New Brunswick), A,\r\nAsterophyllites latifolia. B, Do., apex of stem (?) fruit, C,\r\nC^1, _A. scutigera_. D, _A. latifolia_, larger whorl of leaves. D^1,\r\nLeaf.]\r\n\r\nThe family of the _Equisetaceæ_, or mare's-tails, was also represented\r\nby large species of _Calamites_ and by _Asterophyllites_ in the Erian;\r\nbut, as its headquarters are in the Carboniferous, we may defer its\r\nconsideration till the next chapter. (Figs. 27, 28.)\r\n\r\nPassing over these for the present, we find that the flowering plants are\r\nrepresented in the Erian forests by at least two types of Gymnosperms,\r\nthat of _Taxineæ_ or yews, and an extinct family, that of the _Cordaites_\r\n(Figs. 30, 31). The yew-trees are closely allied to the pines and\r\nspruces, and are often included with them in the family of _Coniferæ_.\r\nThey differ, however, in the habit of producing berries or drupe-like\r\nfruits instead of cones, and there is some reason to believe that this\r\nwas the habit of the Erian trees of this group, though their wood in\r\nsome instances resembles rather that of the Araucaria, or Norfolk\r\nIsland pine, than that of the modern yews. These trees are chiefly\r\nknown to us by their mineralised trunks, which are often found like\r\ndrift-wood on modern sand-banks embedded in the Erian sandstones or\r\nlimestones. It often shows its structure in the most perfect manner in\r\nspecimens penetrated by calcite or silica, or by pyrite, and in which\r\nthe original woody matter has been resolved into anthracite or even into\r\ngraphite. These trees have true woody tissues presenting that beautiful\r\narrangement of pores or thin parts enclosed in cup-like discs, which is\r\ncharacteristic of the coniferous trees, and which is a great improvement\r\non the barred tissue already referred to, affording a far more strong,\r\ntough, and durable wood, such as we have in our modern pines and yews\r\n(Fig. 29).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--_Dadoxylon Ouangondianum_, an Erian conifer, A,\r\nFragment showing Sternberg pith and wood; _a_, medullary sheath; _b_,\r\npith; _c_, wood; _d_, section of pith, B, Wood-cell; _a_, hexagonal\r\nareole; _b_, pore, _c_, Longitudinal section of wood, showing, _a_,\r\nareolation, and _b_, medullary rays, D, Transverse section, showing,\r\n_a_, wood-cells, and _b_, limit of layer of growth, (B, C, D, highly\r\nmagnified.)]\r\n\r\nThese primitive pines make their appearance in the Middle Erian, in\r\nvarious parts of America, as well as in Scotland and Germany, and they\r\nare represented by wood indicating the presence of several species. I\r\nhave myself indicated and described five species from the Erian of Canada\r\nand the United States. From the fact that these trees are represented\r\nby drifted trunks embedded in sandstones and marine limestones, we may,\r\nperhaps, infer that they grew on the rising grounds of the Erian land,\r\nand that their trunks were carried by river-floods into the sea. No\r\ninstance has yet certainly occurred of the discovery of their foliage or\r\nfruit, though there are some fan-shaped leaves usually regarded as ferns\r\nwhich may have belonged to such trees. These in that case would have\r\nresembled the modern _Gingko_ of China, and some of the fruits referred\r\nto the genus _Cardiocarpum_ may have been produced by them. Various\r\nnames have been given to these trees. I have preferred that given by\r\nUnger, _Dadoxylon_, as being more non-committal as to affinities than the\r\nothers.[BC] Many of these trees had very long internal pith-cylinders,\r\nwith curious transverse tubulæ, and which, when preserved separately,\r\nhave been named _Sternbergia_.\r\n\r\n[BC] _Araucarites_, Goeppert; _Araucarioxylon_, Kraus.\r\n\r\nAllied to these trees, and perhaps intermediate between them and the\r\n_Cycads_, were those known as _Cordaites_ (Fig. 30), which had trunks\r\nresembling those of _Dadoxylon_, but with still larger _Sternbergia_\r\npiths and an internal axis of scalariform vessels, surrounded by a\r\ncomparatively thin woody cylinder. Some of them have leaves over a\r\nfoot in length, reminding one of the leaves of broad-leaved grasses or\r\niridaceous plants. Yet their flowers and fruit seem to have been more\r\nnearly allied to the yews than to any other plants (Fig. 31). Their stems\r\nwere less woody and their piths larger than in the true pines, and some\r\nof the larger-leaved species must have had thick, stiff branches. They\r\nare regarded as constituting a separate family, intermediate between\r\npines and cycads, and, beginning in the Middle Devonian, they terminate\r\nin the Permian, where, however, some of the most gigantic species occur.\r\nIn so far as the form and structure of the leaves, stems, and fruit are\r\nconcerned, there is marvellously little difference between the species\r\nfound in the Erian and the Permian. They culminated, however, in the\r\nCarboniferous period, and the coal-fields of southern France have proved\r\nso far the richest in their remains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--_Cordaites Robbii_ (Erian, New Brunswick),\r\n_a_, Group of young leaves. _b_, Point of leaf, _c_, Base of leaf, _d_.\r\nVenation, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Erian fruits, &c., some gymnospermous, and\r\nprobably of _Cordaites_ and Taxine trees (St. John, New Brunswick), A,\r\n_Cardiocarpum cornutum_.

It is to be observed, however, that the non-occurrence of\r\nany similar wood in all the formations between the Upper Erian and the\r\nMiddle Cretaceous suggests very grave doubt as to the authenticity of the\r\nspecimen. I record the fact, waiting further discoveries to confirm it.\r\nOf the character of the specimen which I have described I entertain no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n[BD] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" vol. xviii.\r\n\r\nWe shall be better able to realise the significance and relations of this\r\nancient flora when we have studied that of the succeeding Carboniferous.\r\nWe may merely remark here on the fact that, in these forests of the\r\nDevonian and in the marshes on their margins, we find a wonderful\r\nexpansion of the now modest groups of Rhizocarps and Lycopods, and that\r\nthe flora as a whole belongs to the highest group of Cryptogams and the\r\nlowest of Phænogams, so that it has about it a remarkable aspect of\r\nmediocrity. Further, while there is evidence of some variety of station,\r\nthere is also evidence of much equality of climate, and of a condition\r\nof things more resembling that of the insular climates of the temperate\r\nportions of the southern hemisphere than that of North America or Europe\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nThe only animal inhabitants of these Devonian woods, so far as known,\r\nwere a few species of insects, discovered by Hartt in New Brunswick, and\r\ndescribed by Dr. Scudder. Since, however, we now know that scorpions as\r\nwell as insects existed in the Silurian, it is probable that these also\r\noccurred in the Erian, though their remains have not yet been discovered.\r\nAll the known insects of the Erian woods are allies of the shad-flies and\r\ngrasshoppers (_Neuroptera_ and _Orthoptera_), or intermediate between\r\nthe two. It is probable that the larvæ of most of them lived in water\r\nand fed upon the abundant vegetable matter there, or on the numerous\r\nminute crustaceans and worms. There were no land vertebrates, so far as\r\nknown, but there were fishes (_Dipterus_, etc.), allied to the modern\r\nBarramunda or _Ceratodus_ of Australia, and with teeth suited for\r\ngrinding vegetable food. It is also possible that some of the smaller\r\nplate-covered fishes (Placoganoids, like _Pterichthys_) might have fed\r\non vegetable matter, and, in any case, if they fed on lower animals, the\r\nlatter must have subsisted on plants. I mention these facts to show that\r\nthe superabundant vegetation of this age, whether aquatic or terrestrial,\r\nwas not wholly useless to animals. It is quite likely, also, that we have\r\nyet much to learn of the animal life of the Erian swamps and woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nI.--Classification of Sporangites.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, very unsatisfactory to give names to mere fragments of\r\nplants, yet it seems very desirable to have some means of arranging them.\r\nWith respect to the organisms described above, which were originally\r\ncalled by me _Sporangites_, under the supposition that they were\r\nSporangia rather than spores, this name has so far been vindicated by the\r\ndiscovery of the spore-cases belonging to them, so that I think it may\r\nstill be retained as a provisional name; but I would designate the whole\r\nas _Protosalviniæ_, meaning thereby plants with rhizocarpean affinities,\r\nthough possibly when better understood belonging to different genera. We\r\nmay under these names speak of their detached discs as macrospores and of\r\ntheir cellular envelopes as sporocarps. The following may be recognized\r\nas distinct forms:\r\n\r\n1. _Protosalvinia Huronensis_, Dawson, _Syn._, _Sporangites Huronensis_,\r\n\"Report on Erian Flora of Canada,\" 1871.--Macrospores, in the form of\r\ndiscs or globes, smooth and thick-walled, the walls penetrated by minute\r\nradiating pores. Diameter about one one-hundredth of an inch, or a little\r\nmore, When in situ several macrospores are contained in a thin cellular\r\nsporocarp, probably globular in form. From the Upper Erian, and perhaps\r\nLower Carboniferous shales of Kettle Point, Lake Huron, of various places\r\nin the State of Ohio, and in the shale boulders of the boulder clay of\r\nChicago and vicinity. First collected at Kettle Point by Sir W. E. Logan,\r\nand in Ohio by Prof. Edward Orton, and at Chicago by Dr. H. A. Johnson\r\nand Mr. B. W. Thomas, also in New York by Prof. J. M. Clarke.\r\n\r\nThe macrospores collected by Mr. Thomas from the Chicago clays and shales\r\nconform closely to those of Kettle Point, and probably belong to the\r\nsame species. Some of them are thicker in the outer wall, and show the\r\npores much more distinctly. These have been called by Mr. Thomas _S.\r\nChicagoensis_, and may be regarded as a varietal form. Specimens isolated\r\nfrom the shale and mounted dry, show what seems to have been the hilum or\r\nscar of attachment better than those in balsam.\r\n\r\nSections of the Kettle Point shale show, in addition to the macrospores,\r\nwider and thinner shreds of vegetable matter, which I am inclined to\r\nsuppose to be remains of the sporocarps.\r\n\r\n2. _Protosalvinia_ (_Sporangites_) _Braziliensis_, Dawson, \"Canadian\r\nRecord of Science,\" 1883.--Macrospores, round, smooth, a little longer\r\nthan those of the last species, or about one seventy-fifth of an inch\r\nin diameter, enclosed in round, oval, or slightly reniform sporocarps,\r\neach containing from four to twenty-four macrospores. Longest diameter\r\nof sporocarps three to six millimetres. Structure of wall of sporocarps\r\nhexagonal cellular. Some sporocarps show no macrospores, and may possibly\r\ncontain microspores. The specimens are from the Erian of Brazil.\r\nDiscovered by Mr. Orville Derby. The formation, according to Mr. Derby,\r\nconsists of black shales below, about three hundred feet thick, and\r\ncontaining the fucoid known as Spirophyton, and probably decomposed\r\nvegetable matter. Above this is chocolate and reddish shale, in which\r\nthe well-preserved specimens of Protosalvinia occur. These beds are very\r\nwidely distributed, and abound in _Protosalvinia_ and _Spirophyton_.\r\n\r\n3. _Protosalvinia_ (_Sporangites_) _bilobata_, Dawson, \"Canadian\r\nRecord of Science,\" 1883.--Sporocarps, oval or reniform, three to six\r\nmillimetres in diameter, each showing two rounded prominences at the\r\nends, with a depression in the middle, and sometimes a raised neck or\r\nisthmus at one side connecting the prominences. Structure of sporocarp\r\ncellular. Some of the specimens indicate that each prominence or tubercle\r\ncontained several macrospores. At first sight it would be easy to mistake\r\nthese bodies for valves of _Beyrichia_.\r\n\r\nFound in the same formations with the last species, though, in so far as\r\nthe specimens indicate, not precisely in the same beds. Collected by Mr.\r\nDerby.\r\n\r\n4. _Protosalvinia Clarkei_, Dawson, _P. bilobata_, Clarke, \"American\r\nJournal of Science.\"--Macrospores two-thirds to one millimetre in\r\ndiameter. One, two, or three contained in each sporocarp, which is\r\ncellular. The macrospores have very thick walls with radiating tortuous\r\ntubes. Unless this structure is a result of mineral crystallisation,\r\nthese macrospores must have had very thick walls and must have resembled\r\nin structure the thickened cells of stone fruits and of the core of the\r\npear, or the tests of the Silurian and Erian seeds known as _Pachytheca_,\r\nthough on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that bodies similar to these occur in the Boghead\r\nearthy bitumen, and have been described by Credner.\r\n\r\nI have found similar bodies in the so-called \"Stellar coal\" of the coal\r\ndistrict of Pictou, Nova Scotia, some layers of which are filled with\r\nthem. They occur in groups or patches, which seem to be enclosed in a\r\nsmooth and thin membrane or sporocarp. It is quite likely that these\r\nbodies are generically distinct from _Protosalvinia_.\r\n\r\n5. _Protosalvinia punctata_, Newton, \"Geological Magazine,\" New Series,\r\nDecember 2d, vol. ii.--Mr. Newton has named the discs found in the\r\nwhite coal and Tasmanite, _Tasmanites_, the species being _Tasmanites\r\npunctatus_, but as my name _Sporangites_ had priority, I do not think it\r\nnecessary to adopt this term, though there can be little doubt that these\r\norganisms are of similar character. The same remark may be made with\r\nreference to the bodies described by Huxley and Newton as occurring in\r\nthe Better-bed coal.\r\n\r\nIn Witham's \"Internal Structure of Fossil Vegetables,\" 1833, Plate XI,\r\nare figures of Lancashire cannel which shows _Sporangites_ of the type of\r\nthose in the Erian shales. Quekett, in his \"Report on the Torbane Hill\r\nMineral,\" 1854, has very well figured similar structures from the Methel\r\ncoal and the Lesmahagow cannel coal. These are the earliest publications\r\non the subject known to me; and Quekett, though not understanding the\r\nnature of the bodies he observed, holds that they are a usual ingredient\r\nin cannel coals.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The Nature and Affinities of Ptilophyton.\r\n\r\n(_Lycopodites Vanuxemii_ of \"Report on Devonian and Upper Silurian\r\nPlants,\" Part I., page 35, _L. plumula_ of \"Report on Lower Carboniferous\r\nPlants,\" page 24, Plate I., Figs. 7, 8, 9.) In the reports above referred\r\nto, these remarkable pinnate, frond-like objects were referred to the\r\ngenus _Lycopodites_, as had been done by Goeppert in his description\r\nof the European species _Lycopodites pennæformis_, which is very near\r\nto the American Erian form. Since 1871, however, there have been many\r\nnew specimens obtained, and very various opinions expressed as to their\r\naffinities. While Hall has named some of them _Plumalina_, and has\r\nregarded them as animal structures, allied to hydroids, Lesquereux\r\nhas described some of the Carboniferous forms under the generic name\r\n_Trochophyllum_, which is, however, more appropriate to plants with\r\nverticillate leaves which are included in this genus. Before I had seen\r\nthe publications of Hall and Lesquereux on the subject, I had in a paper\r\non \"Scottish Devonian Plants\"[BE] separated this group from the genus\r\n_Lycopodites_, and formed for it the genus _Ptilophyton_, in allusion\r\nto the feather-like aspect of the species. My reasons for this, and my\r\npresent information as to the nature of these plants, may be stated\r\nas follows: Schimper, in his \"Palæontologie Vegetale\" (possibly from\r\ninattention to the descriptions or want of access to specimens), doubts\r\nthe lycopodiaceous character of species of _Lycopodites_ described in my\r\npublished papers on plants of the Devonian of America and in my Report of\r\n1871. Of these, _L. Richardsoni_ and _L. Matthewi_ are undoubtedly very\r\nnear to the modern genus _Lycopodium_. _L. Vanuxemii_ is, I admit, more\r\nproblematical; but Schimper could scarcely have supposed it to be a fern\r\nor a fucoid allied to _Caulerpa_ had he observed that both in my species\r\nand the allied _L. pennæformis_ of Goeppert, which he does not appear to\r\nnotice, the pinnules are articulated upon the stem, and leave scars where\r\nthey have fallen off. When in Belfast in 1870, my attention was again\r\ndirected to the affinities of these plants by finding in Prof. Thomson's\r\ncollection a specimen from Caithness, which shows a plant apparently\r\nof this kind, with the same long narrow pinna? or leaflets, attached,\r\nhowever, to thicker stems, and rolled up in a circinate manner. It seems\r\nto be a plant in vernation, and the parts are too much crowded and\r\npressed together to admit of being accurately figured or described; but\r\nI think I can scarcely be deceived as to its true nature. The circinate\r\narrangement in this case would favour a relationship to ferns; but some\r\nlycopodiaceous plants also roll themselves in this way, and so do the\r\nbranches of the plants of the genus _Psilophyton_. (Fig. 17, _supra_.)\r\n\r\n[BE] \"Canadian Naturalist,\" 1878.\r\n\r\nThe specimen consists of a short, erect stem, on which are placed\r\nsomewhat stout alternate branches, extending obliquely outward and then\r\ncurving inward in a circinate manner. The lower ones appear to produce\r\non their inner sides short lateral branchlets, and upon these, and also\r\nupon the curved extremities of the branches, are long, narrow, linear\r\nleaves placed in a crowded manner. The specimen is thus not a spike of\r\nfructification, but a young stem or branch in vernation, and which when\r\nunrolled would be of the form of those peculiar pinnate _Lycopodites_\r\nof which _L. Vanuxemii_ of the American Devonian and _L. pennæformis_ of\r\nthe European Lower Carboniferous are the types, and it shows, what might\r\nhave been anticipated from other specimens, that they were low, tufted\r\nplants, circinate in vernation. The short stem of this plant is simply\r\nfurrowed, and bears no resemblance to a detached branch of Lycopodites\r\nMilleri which lies at right angles to it on the same slab. As to the\r\naffinities of the singular type of plants to which this specimen belongs,\r\nI may quote from my \"Report on the Lower Carboniferous Plants of Canada,\"\r\nin which I have described an allied species, _L. plumula_:\r\n\r\n\"The botanical relations of these plants must remain subject to doubt,\r\nuntil either their internal structure or their fructification can be\r\ndiscovered. In the mean time I follow Goeppert in placing them in what\r\nwe must regard as the provisional genus _Lycopodites_. On the one hand,\r\nthey are not unlike the slender twigs of _Taxodium_ and similar Conifers,\r\nand the highly carbonaceous character of the stems gives some colour to\r\nthe supposition that they may have been woody plants. On the other hand,\r\nthey might, so far as form is concerned, be placed with Algæ of the type\r\nof Brongniart's _Chondrites obtusus_, or the modern _Caulerpa plumaria_.\r\nAgain, in a plant of this type from the Devonian of Caithness to which\r\nI have referred in a former memoir, the vernation seems to have been\r\ncircinate, and Schimper has conjectured that these plants may be ferns,\r\nwhich seems also to have been the view of Shumard.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, these plants are allied to Lycopods rather than to ferns;\r\nand as they constitute a small but distinct group, known only, so far\r\nas I am aware, in the Lower Carboniferous and Erian or Devonian, they\r\ndeserve a generic name, and I proposed for them in my \"Paper on Scottish\r\nDevonian Plants,\" 1878, that of _Ptilophyton_, a name sufficiently\r\ndistinct in sound from Psilophyton, and expressing very well their\r\npeculiar feather-like habit of growth. The genus was defined as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Branching plants, the branches bearing long, slender leaves in two or\r\nmore ranks, giving them a feathered appearance; vernation circinate.\r\nFruit unknown, but analogy would indicate that it was borne on the bases\r\nof the leaves or on modified branches with shorter leaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scottish specimen above referred to was named _Pt. Thomsoni_, and was\r\ncharacterised by its densely tufted form and thick branches. The other\r\nspecies known are: _Pt. pennæformis_, Goeppert, L. Carboniferous; _Pt.\r\nVanuxemii_, Dawson, Devonian; _Pt. plumula_, Dawson, L. Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nShumard's _Filicites gracilis_, from the Devonian of Ohio, and Stur's\r\n_Pinites antecedens_, from the Lower Carboniferous of Silesia, may\r\npossibly belong to the same genus. The Scottish specimen referred to is\r\napparently the first appearance of this form in the Devonian of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have at a still later date had opportunities of studying considerable\r\nseries of these plants collected by Prof. Williams, of Cornell\r\nUniversity, and prepared a note in reference to them for the American\r\nAssociation, of which, however, only an abstract has been published.\r\nI have also been favoured by Prof. Lesquereux and Mr. Lacoe, of\r\nPittston, with the opportunity of studying the specimens referred to\r\n_Trochophyllum_.\r\n\r\nProf. Williams's specimens occur in a dark shale associated with\r\nremains of land-plants of the genera _Psilophyton_. _Rhodea_, &c.,\r\nand also marine shells, of which a small species of _Rhynchonella_ is\r\noften attached to the stems of the _Ptilophyton_. Thus these organisms\r\nhave evidently been deposited in marine beds, but in association with\r\nland-plants.\r\n\r\nThe study of the specimens collected by Prof. Williams develops the\r\nfollowing facts: (1) The plants are not continuous fronds, but slender\r\nstems or petioles, with narrow, linear leaflets attached in a pinnate\r\nmanner. (2) The pinnules are so articulated that they break off, leaving\r\ndelicate transverse scars, and the lower parts of the stems are often\r\nthus denuded of pinnæ for the length of one or more inches. (3) The\r\nstems curve in such a manner as to indicate a circinate vernation. (4)\r\nIn a few instances the fronds were observed to divide dichotomously\r\ntoward the top; but this is rare. (5) There are no indications of cells\r\nin the pinnules; but, on the other hand, there is no appearance of\r\nfructification unless the minute granules which roughen some of the\r\nsterns are of this nature. (6) The stems seem to have been lax and\r\nflexuous, and in some instances they seem to have grown on the petioles\r\nof ferns preserved with them in the same beds. (7) The frequency of the\r\nattachment of small brachiopods to the specimens of _Ptilophyton_ would\r\nseem to indicate that the plant stood erect in the water. (8) Some of\r\nthe specimens show so much carbonaceous matter as to indicate that the\r\npinnules were of considerable consistency. All these characters are those\r\nrather of an aquatic plant than of an animal organism or of a land-plant.\r\n\r\nThe specimens communicated by Prof. Lesquereux and Mr. Lacoe are from the\r\nLower Carboniferous, and evidently represent a different species with\r\nsimilar slender pitted stems, often partially denuded of pinnules below;\r\nbut the pinnules are much broader and more distant. They are attached\r\nby very narrow bases, and apparently tend to lie on a plane, though they\r\nmay possibly have been spirally arranged. On the same slabs are rounded\r\nsporangia or macrospores like those of _Lepidodendron_, but there is no\r\nevidence that these belonged to _Trochophyllum_. On the stems of this\r\nplant, however, there are small, rounded bodies apparently taking the\r\nplaces of some of the pinnules. These may possibly be spore-cases; but\r\nthey may be merely imperfectly developed pinnules. Still the fact that\r\nsimilar small granules appear on the stems of the Devonian species,\r\nfavours the idea that they may be organs of fructification.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting discovery, however, which results from the study\r\nof Mr. Lacoe's specimens, is that the pinnules were cylindrical and\r\nhollow, and probably served to float the plant. This would account for\r\nmany of the peculiarities in the appearance and mode of occurrence of the\r\nDevonian _Ptilophyton_, which are readily explained if it is supposed to\r\nbe an aquatic plant, attaching itself to the stems of submerged vegetable\r\nremains and standing erect in the water by virtue of its hollow leaves.\r\nIt may well, however, have been a plant of higher organisation than the\r\nAlgæ, though no doubt cryptogamous.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Ptilophyton_ will thus constitute a peculiar group\r\nof aquatic plants, belonging to the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous\r\nperiods, and perhaps allied to Lycopods and Pillworts in their\r\norganisation and fruit, but specially distinguished by their linear\r\nleaves serving as floats and arranged pinnately on slender stems. The\r\nonly species yet found within the limits of Canada is _Pt. plumula_,\r\nfound by Dr. Honeyman in the Lower Carboniferous of Nova Scotia; but as\r\n_Pt. Vanuxemii_ abounds in the Erian of New York, it will no doubt be\r\nfound in Canada also.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--Tree-Ferns of the Erian Period.\r\n\r\nAs the fact of the occurrence of true tree-ferns in rocks so old as the\r\nMiddle Erian or Devonian has been doubted in some quarters, the following\r\nsummary is given from descriptions published in the \"Journal of the\r\nGeological Society of London\" (1871 and 1881), where figures of the\r\nspecies will be found:\r\n\r\nOf the numerous ferns now known in the Middle and Upper Devonian of\r\nNorth America, a great number are small and delicate species, which were\r\nprobably herbaceous; but there are other species which may have been\r\ntree-ferns. Little definite information, however, has, until recently,\r\nbeen obtained with regard to their habit of growth.\r\n\r\nThe only species known to me in the Devonian of Europe is the\r\n_Caulopteris Peachii_ of Salter, figured in the \"Quarterly Journal of\r\nthe Geological Society\" for 1858. The original specimen of this I had an\r\nopportunity of seeing in London, through the kindness of Mr. Etheridge,\r\nand have no doubt that it is the stem of a small arborescent fern, allied\r\nto the genus _Caulopteris_, of the coal formation.\r\n\r\nIn my paper on the Devonian of Eastern America (\"Quarterly Journal\r\nof the Geological Society,\" 1862), I mentioned a plant found by Mr.\r\nRichardson at Perry, as possibly a species of _Megaphyton_, using that\r\nterm to denote those stems of tree-ferns which have the leaf-scars in\r\ntwo vertical series; but the specimen was obscure, and I have not yet\r\nobtained any other.\r\n\r\nMore recently, in 1869, Prof. Hall placed in my hands an interesting\r\ncollection from Gilboa, New York, and Madison County, New York, including\r\ntwo trunks surrounded by aërial roots, which I have described as\r\n_Psaronius textilis_ and _P. Erianus_, in my \"Revision of the Devonian\r\nFlora,\" read before the Royal Society.[BF] In the same collection were\r\ntwo very large petioles, _Rhachiopteris gigantea_ and _R. palmata_, which\r\nI have suggested may have belonged to tree-ferns.\r\n\r\n[BF] Abstract in \"Proceedings of the Royal Society,\" May, 1870; also\r\n\"Report on Erian Plants of Canada,\" 1871.\r\n\r\nMy determination of the species of _Psaronius_, above mentioned, has\r\nrecently been completely confirmed by the discovery on the part of Mr.\r\nLockwood, of Gilboa, of the upper part of one of these stems, with its\r\nleaf-scars preserved and petioles attached, and also by some remarkable\r\nspecimens obtained by Prof. Newberry, of New York, from the Corniferous\r\nlimestone of Ohio, which indicate the existence there of three species of\r\ntree-ferns, one of them with aërial roots similar to those of the Gilboa\r\nspecimens. The whole of these specimens Dr. Newberry has kindly allowed\r\nme to examine, and has permitted me to describe the Gilboa specimen,\r\nas connected with those which I formerly studied in Prof. Hall's\r\ncollections. The specimens from Ohio he has himself named, but allows me\r\nto notice them here by way of comparison with the others. I shall add\r\nsome notes on specimens found with the Gilboa ferns.\r\n\r\nIt may be further observed that the Gilboa specimens are from a bed\r\ncontaining erect stumps of tree-ferns, in the Chemung group of the Upper\r\nDevonian, while those from Ohio are from a marine limestone, belonging to\r\nthe lower part of the Middle Devonian.\r\n\r\n1. _Caulopteris Lockwoodi_, Dawson.--Trunk from two to three inches in\r\ndiameter, rugose longitudinally. Leaf-scars broad, rounded above, and\r\nradiatingly rugose, with an irregular scar below, arranged spirally in\r\nabout five ranks; vascular bundles not distinctly preserved. Petioles\r\nslender, much expanded at the base, dividing at first in a pinnate\r\nmanner, and afterwards dichotomously. Ultimate pinnæ with remains of\r\nnumerous, apparently narrow pinnules.\r\n\r\nThis stem is probably the upper part of one or other of the species\r\nof _Psaronius_ found in the same bed (_P. Erianus_, Dawson, and _P.\r\ntextilis_, Dawson).[BG] It appears to have been an erect stem embedded\r\nin situ in sandstone, and preserved as a cast. The stem is small, being\r\nonly two inches, or a little more, in diameter. It is coarsely wrinkled\r\nlongitudinally, and covered with large leaf-scars, each an inch in\r\ndiameter, of a horseshoe-shape. The petioles, five of which remain,\r\nseparate from these scars with a distinct articulation, except at one\r\npoint near the base, where probably a bundle or bundles of vessels passed\r\ninto the petiole. They retain their form at the attachment to the stem,\r\nbut a little distance from it they are flattened. They are inflated\r\nat the base, and somewhat rapidly diminish in size. The leaf-scars\r\nvary in form, and are not very distinct, but they appear to present\r\na semicircular row of pits above, largest in the middle. From these\r\nthere proceed downward a series of irregular furrows, converging to a\r\nsecond and more obscure semicircle of pits, within or below which is the\r\nirregular scar or break above referred to. The attitude and form of the\r\npetioles will be seen from Fig. 24, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[BG] Memoir on Devonian Flora, \"Proceedings of the Royal Society,\" May,\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nThe petioles are broken off within a few inches of the stem; but other\r\nfragments found in the same beds appear to show their continuation, and\r\nsome remains of their foliage. One specimen shows a series of processes\r\nat the sides, which seem to be the remains of small pinnæ, or possibly\r\nof spines on the margin of the petiole. Other fragments show the\r\ndivision of the frond, at first in a pinnate manner, and subsequently by\r\nbifurcation; and some fragments show remains of pinnules, possibly of\r\nfertile pinnules. These are very indistinct, but would seem to show that\r\nthe plant approached, in the form of its fronds and the arrangement of\r\nits fructification, to the Cyclopterids of the sub-genus _Aneimites_,\r\none of which (_Aneimites Acadica_), from the Lower Carboniferous of Nova\r\nScotia, I have elsewhere described as probably a tree-fern,[BH] The\r\nfronds were evidently different from those of _Archæopteris_[BI] a genus\r\ncharacteristic of the same beds, but of very different habit of growth.\r\nThis accords with the fact that there is in Prof. Hall's collection a\r\nmass of fronds of _Cyclopteris_ (_Archæopteris_) Jacksoni, so arranged\r\nas to make it probable that the plant was an herbaceous fern, producing\r\ntufts of fronds on short stems in the ordinary way. The obscurity of\r\nthe leaf-scars may render it doubtful whether the plant above described\r\nshould be placed in the genus _Caulopteris_ or in _Stemmatopteris_; but\r\nit appears most nearly allied to the former. The genus is at present,\r\nof course, a provisional one; but I have thought it only justice to the\r\ndiligent labours of Mr. Lockwood to name this curious and interesting\r\nfossil _Caulopteris Lockwoodi_.\r\n\r\n[BH] \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,\" 1860.\r\n\r\n[BI] The genus to which the well-known _Cyclopteris_ (_Adiantites_)\r\n_Hibernicus_ of the Devonian of Ireland belongs.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere remarked on the fact that trunks, and petioles, and\r\npinnules of ferns are curiously dissociated in the Devonian beds--an\r\neffect of water-sorting, characteristic of a period in which the\r\nconditions of deposition were so varied. Another example of this is,\r\nthat in the sandstones of Gaspé Bay, which have not as yet afforded\r\nany example of fronds of ferns, there are compressed trunks, which Mr.\r\nLockwood's specimens allow me at least to conjecture may have belonged\r\nto tree-ferns, although none of them are sufficiently perfect for\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nMr. Lockwood's collection includes specimens of _Psaronius textilis_; and\r\nin addition to these there are remains of erect stems somewhat different\r\nin character, yet possibly belonging to the higher parts of the same\r\nspecies of tree-fern. One of these is a stem crushed in such a manner\r\nthat it does not exhibit its form with any distinctness, but surrounded\r\nby smooth, cylindrical roots, radiating from it in bundles, proceeding at\r\nfirst horizontally, and then curving downward, and sometimes terminating\r\nin rounded ends. They resemble in form and size the aërial roots of\r\n_Psaronius Erianus_; and I believe them to be similar roots from a higher\r\npart of the stem, and some of them young and not prolonged sufficiently\r\nfar to reach the ground. This specimen would thus represent the stem\r\nof _P. Erianus_ at a higher level than those previously found. We can\r\nthus in imagination restore the trunk and crown of this once graceful\r\ntree-fern, though we have not the detail of its fronds. Mr. Lockwood's\r\ncollections also contain a specimen of the large fern-petiole which I\r\nhave named _Rhachiopteris punctata_. My original specimen was obtained by\r\nProf. Hall from the same horizon in New York. That of Mr. Lockwood is of\r\nlarger size, but retains no remains of the frond. It must have belonged\r\nto a species quite distinct from _Caulopteris Lockwoodi_, but which may,\r\nlike it, have been a tree-fern.\r\n\r\n2. _Caulopteris antiqua_, Newberry.--This is a flattened stem, on a slab\r\nof limestone, containing Brachiopods, Trilobites, &c., of the Corniferous\r\nlimestone. It is about eighteen inches in length, and three and a half\r\ninches in average breadth. The exposed side shows about twenty-two large\r\nleaf-scars arranged spirally. Each leaf, where broken off, has left\r\na rough fracture; and above this is a semicircular impression of the\r\npetiole against the stem, which, as well as the surface of the bases of\r\nthe petioles, is longitudinally striated or tuberculated. The structures\r\nare not preserved, but merely the outer epidermis, as a coaly film. The\r\nstem altogether much resembles _Caulopteris Peachii_, but is of larger\r\nsize. It differs from _C. Lockwoodi_ in the more elongated leaf-bases,\r\nand in the leaves being more remotely placed; but it is evidently of the\r\nsame general character with that species.\r\n\r\n3. _Caulopteris_ (_Protopteris_) _peregrina_, Newberry.--This is a much\r\nmore interesting species than the last, as belonging to a generic or\r\nsubgeneric form not hitherto recognised below the Carboniferous, and\r\nhaving its minute structure in part preserved.\r\n\r\nThe specimens are, like the last, on slabs of marine limestone of the\r\nCorniferous formation, and flattened. One represents an upper portion\r\nof the stem with leaf-scars and remains of petioles; another a lower\r\nportion, with aërial roots. The upper part is three inches in diameter,\r\nand about a foot in length, and shows thirty leaf-scars which are about\r\nthree-fourths of an inch wide, and rather less in depth. The upper part\r\npresents a distinct rounded and sometimes double marginal line, sometimes\r\nwith a slight depression in the middle. The lower part is irregular,\r\nand when most perfect shows seven slender vascular bundles, passing\r\nobliquely downward into the stem. The more perfect leaf-bases have the\r\nstructure preserved, and show a delicate, thin-walled, oval parenchyma,\r\nwhile the vascular bundles show scalariform vessels with short bars in\r\nseveral rows, in the manner of many modern ferns. Some of the scars show\r\ntraces of the hippocrepian mark characteristic of _Protopteris_; and the\r\narrangement of the vascular bundles at the base of the scars is the same\r\nas in that genus, as are also the general form and arrangement of the\r\nscars. On careful examination, the species is indeed very near to the\r\ntypical _P. Sternbergii_, as figured by Corda and Schimper.[BJ]\r\n\r\n[BJ] Corda, \"Beiträge,\" Pl. 48, copied by Schimper, Pl. 52.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Protopteris_ of Sternberg, though the original species (_P.\r\npunctata_) appears as a _Lepidodendron_ in his earlier plate (Plate 4),\r\nand as a _Sigillaria_ (_S. punctata_) in Brongniart's great work, is a\r\ntrue tree-fern; and the structure of one species (_P. Cottai_) has been\r\nbeautifully figured by Corda. The species hitherto described are from the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian.\r\n\r\nThe second specimen of this species represents a lower part of the stem.\r\nIt is thirteen inches long and about four inches in diameter, and is\r\ncovered with a mass of flattened aërial roots lying parallel to each\r\nother, in the manner of the _Psaronites_ of the coal-formation and of _P.\r\nErianus_ of the Upper Erian or Devonian.\r\n\r\n4. _Asteropteris noveboracensis_, gen. and sp. n.--The genus\r\n_Asteropteris_ is established for stems of ferns having the axial portion\r\ncomposed of vertical radiating plates of scalariform tissue embedded in\r\nparenchyma, and having the outer cylinder composed of elongated cells\r\ntraversed by leaf-bundles of the type of those of _Zygopteris_.\r\n\r\nThe only species known to me is represented by a stem 2·5 centimetres in\r\ndiameter, slightly wrinkled and pitted externally, perhaps by traces of\r\naërial roots which have perished. The transverse section shows in the\r\ncentre four vertical plates of scalariform or imperfectly reticulated\r\ntissue, placed at right angles to each other, and united in the middle\r\nof the stem. At a short distance from the centre, each of these plates\r\ndivides into two or three, so as to form an axis of from ten to twelve\r\nradiating plates, with remains of cellular tissue filling the angular\r\ninterspaces. The greatest diameter of this axis is about 1·5 centimetre.\r\nExterior to the axis the stem consists of elongated cells, with somewhat\r\nthick walls, and more dense toward the circumference. The walls of\r\nthese cells present a curious reticulated appearance, apparently caused\r\nby the cracking of the ligneous lining in consequence of contraction\r\nin the process of carbonization. Embedded in this outer cylinder are\r\nabout twelve vascular bundles, each with a dumb-bell-shaped group of\r\nscalariform vessels enclosed in a sheath of thick-walled fibres. Each\r\nbundle is opposite to one of the rays of the central axis. The specimen\r\nshows about two inches of the length of the stem, and is somewhat bent,\r\napparently by pressure, at one end.\r\n\r\nThis stem is evidently that of a small tree-fern of a type, so far as\r\nknown to me, not before described,[BK] and constituting a very complex\r\nand symmetrical form of the group of Palæozoic ferns allied to the\r\ngenus _Zygopteris_ of Schimper. The central axis alone has a curious\r\nresemblance to the peculiar stem described by Unger (\"Devonian Flora\r\nof Thuringia\") under the name of _Cladoxylon mirabile_; and it is just\r\npossible that this latter stem may be the axis of some allied plant. The\r\nlarge aërial roots of some modern tree-ferns of the genus _Angiopteris_\r\nhave, however, an analogous radiating structure.\r\n\r\n[BK] Prof. Williamson, to whom I have sent a tracing of the structure,\r\nagrees with me that it is new.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is from the collection of Berlin H. Wright, Esq., of Penn\r\nYan, New York, and was found in the Portage group (Upper Erian) of Milo,\r\nNew York, where it was associated with large petioles of ferns and trunks\r\nof _Lepidodendra_, probably _L. Chemungense_ and _L. primævum_.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of this and other stems of tree-ferns in marine beds\r\nhas recently been illustrated by the observation of Prof. A. Agassiz\r\nthat considerable quantities of vegetable matter can be dredged from\r\ngreat depths in the sea on the leeward side of the Caribbean Islands.\r\nThe occurrence of these trunks further connects itself with the great\r\nabundance of large petioles (_Rhachiopteris_) in the same beds, while the\r\nrarity of well-preserved fronds is explained by the coarseness of the\r\nbeds, and also by the probably long maceration of the plant-remains in\r\nthe sea-water.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this I may refer to the remarkable facts recently\r\nstated by Williamson[BL] respecting the stems known as Heterangium and\r\n_Lyginodendron_. It would seem that these, while having strong exogenous\r\npeculiarities, are really stems of tree-ferns, thus placing this family\r\nin the same position of advancement with the Lycopods and Equisetaceæ of\r\nthe Coal period.\r\n\r\n[BL] \"Proceedings of the Royal Society,\" January 6, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--On Erian Trees of the Genus Dadoxylon, Unger. (_Araucarites_ of\r\nGoeppert, _Araucarioxylon_ of Kraus.)\r\n\r\nLarge woody trunks, carbonised or silicified, and showing wood-cells with\r\nhexagonal areoles having oval pores inscribed in them, occur abundantly\r\nin some beds of the Middle Erian of America, and constitute the most\r\ncommon kind of fossil wood all the way to the Trias. They have in the\r\nolder formations, generally, several rows of pores on each fibre, and\r\nmedullary rays composed of two or more series of cells, but become more\r\nsimple in these respects in the Permian and Triassic series. The names\r\n_Araucarites_ and _Araucarioxylon_ are perhaps objectionable, inasmuch\r\nas they suppose affinities to _Araucaria_ which may not exist. Unger's\r\nname, which is non-committal, is therefore, I think, to be preferred. In\r\nmy \"Acadian Geology,\" and in my \"Report on the Geology of Prince Edward\r\nIsland,\" I have given reasons for believing that the foliage of some at\r\nleast of these trees was that known as _Walchia_, and that they may have\r\nborne nutlets in the manner of Taxine trees (_Trigonocarpum_, &c). Grand\r\nd'Eury has recently suggested that some of them may have belonged to\r\n_Cordaites_, or to plants included in that somewhat varied and probably\r\nartificial group.\r\n\r\nThe earliest discovery of trees of this kind in the Erian of America was\r\nthat of Matthew and Hartt, who found large trunks, which I afterwards\r\ndescribed as _Dadoxylon Ouangondianum_, in the Erian sandstone of St.\r\nJohn, New Brunswick, hence named by those geologists the \"Dadoxylon\r\nsandstone.\" A little later, similar wood was found by Prof. Hall and\r\nProf. Newberry in the Hamilton group of New York and Ohio, and the allied\r\nwood of the genus _Ormoxylon_ was obtained by Prof. Hall in the Portage\r\ngroup of the former State. These woods proved to be specifically distinct\r\nfrom that of St. John, and were named by me _D. Halli_, _D. Newberryi_,\r\nand _Ormoxylon Erianum_. The three species of _Dadoxylon_ agreed in\r\nhaving composite medullary rays, and would thus belong to the group\r\n_Palæoxylon_ of Brongniart. In the case of _Ormoxylon_ this character\r\ncould not be very distinctly ascertained, but the medullary rays appeared\r\nto be simple.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Prof. J. M. Clarke, of Amherst College, Massachusetts,\r\nfor some well-preserved specimens of another species from the Genesee\r\nshale of Canandaigua, New York. They show small steins or branches, with\r\na cellular pith surrounded with wood of coniferous type, showing two\r\nto three rows of slit-formed, bordered pores in hexagonal borders. The\r\nmedullary sheath consists of pseudo-scalariform and reticulated fibres;\r\nbut the most remarkable feature of this wood is the structure of the\r\nmedullary rays, which are very frequent, but short and simple, sometimes\r\nhaving as few as four cells superimposed. This is a character not before\r\nobserved in coniferous trees of so great age, and allies this Middle\r\nErian form with some Carboniferous woods which have been supposed to\r\nbelong to _Cordaites_ or _Sigillaria_. In any case this structure is new,\r\nand I have named the species _Dadoxylon Clarkii_, after its discoverer.\r\nThe specimens occur, according to Prof. Clarke, in a calcareous layer\r\nwhich is filled with the minute shells of _Styliola fissurella_ of Hall,\r\nbelieved to be a Pteropod; and containing also shells of _Goniatites_ and\r\n_Gyroceras_. The stems found are only a few inches in diameter, but may\r\nbe branches of larger trees.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that we already know five species of Coniferous trees\r\nof the genus _Dadoxylon_ in the Middle Erian of America, an interesting\r\nconfirmation of the facts otherwise known as to the great richness and\r\nvariety of this ancient flora. The late Prof. Goeppert informed me that\r\nhe had recognised similar wood in the Devonian of Germany, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that the fossil wood discovered by Hugh Miller in the\r\nOld Red Sandstone of Scotland, and described by Salter and McNab, is of\r\nsimilar character, and probably belongs to the genus _Dadoxylon_. Thus\r\nthis type of Coniferous tree seems to have been as well established and\r\ndifferentiated into species in the Middle Devonian as in the succeeding\r\nCarboniferous.\r\n\r\nI may here refer to the fact that the lower limit of the trees of\r\nthis group coincides, in America, with the upper limit of those\r\nproblematical trees which in the previous chapter I have named Protogens\r\n(_Nematophyton_, _Celluloxlyon_,[BM] _Nematoxylon_[BN]), though\r\n_Aporoxylon_ of Unger extends, in Thuringia, up to the Upper Devonian\r\n(Cypridina schists).\r\n\r\n[BM] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" May, 1881.\r\n\r\n[BN] _Ibid._, vol. xix, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--Scottish Devonian Plants of Hugh Miller and others. (Edinburgh\r\nGeological Society, 1877.)\r\n\r\nPreviously to the appearance of my descriptions of Devonian plants\r\nfrom North America, Hugh Miller had described forms from the Devonian\r\nof Scotland, similar to those for which I proposed the generic name\r\n_Psilophyton_; and I referred to these in this connection in my earliest\r\ndescription of that genus.[BO] He had also recognised what seemed to be\r\nplants allied to Lycopods and Conifers. Mr. Peach and Mr. Duncan had made\r\nadditional discoveries of this kind, and Sir J. Hooker and Mr. Salter had\r\ndescribed some of these remains. More recently Messrs. Peach, Carruthers,\r\nand McNab have worked in this field, and still later[BP] Messrs. Jack and\r\nEtheridge have summed up the facts and have added some that are new.\r\n\r\n[BO] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" London, 1859.\r\n\r\n[BP] _Ibid._, 1877.\r\n\r\nThe first point to which I shall refer, and which will lead to the\r\nother matters to be discussed, is the relation of the characteristic\r\n_Lepidodendron_ of the Devonian of eastern America, _L. Gaspianum_, to\r\n_L. nothum_ of Unger and of Salter. At the time when I described this\r\nspecies I had not access to Scottish specimens of _Lepidodendron_ from\r\nthe Devonian, but these had been well figured and described by Salter,\r\nand had been identified with _L. nothum_ of Unger, a species evidently\r\ndistinct from mine, as was also that figured and described by Salter,\r\nwhether identical or not with Unger's species. In 1870 I had for the\r\nfirst time an opportunity to study Scottish specimens in the collection\r\nof Mr. Peach; and on the evidence thus afforded I stated confidently\r\nthat these specimens represented a species distinct from _L. Gaspianum_,\r\nperhaps even generically so.[BQ] It differs from _L. Gaspianum_ in\r\nits habit of growth by developing small lateral branches instead of\r\nbifurcating, and in its foliage by the absence or obsolete character of\r\nthe leaf-bases and the closely placed and somewhat appressed leaves. If\r\nan appearance of swelling at the end of a lateral branch in one specimen\r\nindicates a strobile of fructification, then its fruit was not dissimilar\r\nfrom that of the Canadian species in its position and general form,\r\nthough it may have differed in details. On these grounds I declined to\r\nidentify the Scottish species with _L. Gaspianum_. The Lepidodendron\r\nfrom the Devonian of Belgium described and figured by Crepin,[BR] has\r\na better claim to such identification, and would seem to prove that\r\nthis species existed in Europe as well as in America. I also saw in Mr.\r\nPeach's collection in 1870 some fragments which seemed to me distinct\r\nfrom Salter's species, and possibly belonging to _L. Gaspianum_.[BS]\r\n\r\n[BQ] \"Report on Devonian Plants of Canada,\" 1871.\r\n\r\n[BR] \"Observations sur quelques Plantes Fossiles des dépôts Devoniens.\"\r\n\r\n[BS] \"Proceedings of the Geological Society of London,\" March, 1871.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest description of _Psilophyton_ I recognised its probable\r\ngeneric affinity with Miller's \"dichotomous plants,\" with Salter's\r\n\"rootlets,\" and with Goeppert's _Haliserites Dechenianus_, and stated\r\nthat I had \"little doubt that materials exist in the Old Red Sandstone of\r\nScotland for the reconstruction of at least one species of this genus.\"\r\nSince, however, Miller's plants had been referred to coniferous roots,\r\nand to fucoids, and Goeppert's _Haliserites_ was a name applicable only\r\nto fucoids, and since the structure and fruit of my plants placed them\r\nnear to Lycopods, I was under the necessity of giving them a special\r\ngeneric name, nor could I with certainty affirm their specific identity\r\nwith any European species. The comparison of the Scottish specimens with\r\nwoody rootlets, though incorrect, is in one respect creditable to the\r\nacumen of Salter, as in almost any state of preservation an experienced\r\neye can readily perceive that branchlets of _Psilophyton_ must have been\r\nwoody rather than herbaceous, and their appearance is quite different\r\nfrom that of any true Algæ.\r\n\r\nThe type of _Psilophyton_ is my _P. princeps_, of which the whole of the\r\nparts and structures are well known, the entire plant being furnished in\r\nabundance and in situ in the rich plant-beds of Gaspé. A second species,\r\n_P. robustius_, has also afforded well-characterised fructification. _P.\r\nelegans_, whose fruit appears as \"oval scales,\" no doubt bore sac-like\r\nspore-cases resembling those of the other species, but in a different\r\nposition, and perfectly flattened in the specimens procured. The only\r\nother Canadian species, _P. glabrum_, being somewhat different in\r\nappearance from the others, and not having afforded any fructification,\r\nmust be regarded as uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe generic characters of the first three species may be stated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nStems dichotomous, with rudimentary subulate leaves, sometimes obsolete\r\nin terminal branchlets and fertile branches; and in decorticated\r\nspecimens represented only by punctiform scars. Young branches circinate.\r\nRhizomata cylindrical, with circular root-areoles. Internal structure of\r\nstem, an axis of scalariform vessels enclosed in a sheath of imperfect\r\nwoody tissue and covered with a cellular bark more dense externally.\r\nFruit, naked sac-like spore-cases, in pairs or clusters, terminal or\r\nlateral.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish specimens conform to these characters in so far as they are\r\nknown, but not having as yet afforded fruit or internal structure, they\r\ncannot be specifically determined with certainty. More complete specimens\r\nshould be carefully searched for, and will no doubt be found.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, M. Crepin has described a new species from the Upper Devonian\r\nof Condroz under the name _P. Condrusianum_ (1875). It wants, however,\r\nsome of the more important characters of the genus, and differs in having\r\na pinnate ramification, giving it the aspect of a fern. In a later paper\r\n(1876) the author considers this species distinct from _Psilophyton_, and\r\nproposes for it a new generic name _Rhacophyton_.\r\n\r\nThe characters given by Mr. Carruthers, in his paper of 1873, for the\r\nspecies _P. Dechenianum_, are very few and general: \"Lower branches short\r\nand frequently branching, giving the plant an oblong circumscription.\"\r\nYet even these characters do not apply, so far as known, to Miller's\r\nfucoids or Salter's rootlets or Goeppert's _Haliserites_. They merely\r\nexpress the peculiar mode of branching already referred to in Salter's\r\n_Lepidodendron nothum_. The identification of the former plants with\r\nthe _Lepidodendron_ and _Lycopodites_, indeed, rests only on mere\r\njuxtaposition of fragments, and on the slight resemblance of the\r\ndecorticated ends of the branches of the latter plants to _Psilophyton_.\r\nIt is contradicted by the obtuse ends of the branches of the\r\n_Lepidodendron_ and _Lycopodites_, and by the apparently strobilaceous\r\ntermination of some of them.\r\n\r\nSalter's description of his _Lepidodendron nothum_ is quite definite, and\r\naccords with specimens placed in my hands by Mr. Peach: \"Stems half an\r\ninch broad, tapering little, branches short; set on at an acute angle,\r\nblunt at their terminations. Leaves in seven to ten rows, very short,\r\nnot a line long, and rather spreading than closely imbricate.\" These\r\ncharacters, however, in so far as they go, are rather those of the genus\r\n_Lycopodites_ than of _Lepidodendron_, from which this plant differs\r\nin wanting any distinct leaf-bases, and in its short, crowded leaves.\r\nIt is to be observed that they apply also to Salter's _Lycopodites\r\nMilleri_, and that the difference of the foliage of that species may be\r\na result merely of different state of preservation. For these reasons I\r\nam disposed to place these two supposed species together, and to retain\r\nfor the species the name _Lycopodites Milleri_. It may be characterised\r\nby the description above given, with merely the modification that the\r\nleaves are sometimes nearly one-third of an inch long and secund (Fig.\r\n17, _supra_, lower figure).\r\n\r\nDecorticated branches of the above species may no doubt be mistaken\r\nfor _Psilophyton_, but are nevertheless quite distinct from it, and\r\nthe slender branching dichotomous stems, with terminations which, as\r\nMiller graphically states, are \"like the tendrils of a pea,\" are too\r\ncharacteristic to be easily mistaken, even when neither fruit nor leaves\r\nappear. With reference to fructification, the form of _L. Milleri_\r\nrenders it certain that it must have borne strobiles at the ends of its\r\nbranchlets, or some substitute for these, and not naked spore-cases like\r\nthose of _Psilophyton_.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fragment communicated by Sir Philip Egerton to Mr.\r\nCarruthers,[BT] belongs to a third group, and has, I think, been quite\r\nmisunderstood. I am enabled to make this statement with some confidence,\r\nfrom the fact that the reverse or counterpart of Sir Philip's specimen\r\nwas in the collection of Sir Wyville Thomson, and was placed by him in\r\nmy hands in 1870. It was noticed in my paper on \"New Devonian Plants,\"\r\nin the \"Journal of the Geological Society of London,\" and referred to my\r\ngenus _Ptilophyton_, as stated above under Section II., page 86 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[BT] \"Journal of Botany,\" 1873.\r\n\r\nMr. Salter described, in 1857,[BU] fragments of fossil wood from the\r\nScottish Devonian, having the structure of Dadoxylon, though very\r\nimperfectly preserved; and Prof. McNab has proposed[BV] the generic name\r\n_Palæopitys_ for another specimen of coniferous wood collected by Hugh\r\nMiller, and referred to by him in the \"Testimony of the Rocks.\" From\r\nProf. McNab's description, I should infer that this wood may, after all,\r\nbe generically identical with the woods usually referred to Dadoxylon\r\nof Unger (_Araucarioxylon_ of Kraus). The description, however, does\r\nnot mention the number and disposition of the rows of pores, nor the\r\nstructure of the medullary rays, and I have not been able to obtain\r\naccess to the specimens themselves. I have described five species of\r\nDadoxylon from the Middle and Upper Erian of America, all quite distinct\r\nfrom the Lower Carboniferous species. There is also one species of an\r\nallied genus, Ormoxylon. All these have been carefully figured, and it is\r\nmuch to be desired that the Scottish specimens should be re-examined and\r\ncompared with them.\r\n\r\n[BU] \"Journal of the London Geological Society.\"\r\n\r\n[BV] \"Transactions of the Edinburgh Botanical Society,\" 1870.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Jack and Etheridge have given an excellent summary of our present\r\nknowledge of the Devonian flora of Scotland, in the Journal of the\r\nLondon Geological Society (1877). From this it would appear that species\r\nreferable to the genera _Calamities_, _Lepidodendron_, _Lycopodites_,\r\n_Psilophyton_, _Arthrostigma_, _Archæopteris_, _Caulopteris_,\r\n_Palæopitys_, _Araucarioxylon_, and _Stigmaria_ have been recognised.\r\n\r\nThe plants described by these gentlemen from the Old Red Sandstone of\r\nCallender, I should suppose, from their figures and descriptions, to\r\nbelong to the genus _Arthrostigma_, rather than to Psilophyton. I do\r\nnot attach any importance to the suggestions referred to by them, that\r\nthe apparent leaves may be leaf-bases. Long leaf-bases, like those\r\ncharacteristic of _Lepidofloyos_, do not occur in these humbler plants\r\nof the Devonian. The stems with delicate \"horizontal processes\" to which\r\nthey refer may belong to _Ptilophyton_ or to _Pinnularia_.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I need scarcely say that I do not share in the doubts\r\nexpressed by some British palæontologists as to the distinctness of\r\nthe Devonian and Carboniferous floras. In eastern America, where these\r\nformations are mutually unconformable, there is, of course, less room\r\nfor doubt than in Ireland and in western America, where they are\r\nstratigraphically continuous. Still, in passing from the one to the\r\nother, the species are for the most part different, and new generic forms\r\nare met with, and, as I have elsewhere shown, the physical conditions of\r\nthe two periods were essentially different.[BW]\r\n\r\n[BW] \"Reports on Devonian Plants and Lower Carboniferous Plants of\r\nCanada.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to be observed that since--as Stur and others have\r\nshown--_Calamities radiatus_, and other forms distinctively Devonian in\r\nAmerica, occur in Europe in the Lower Carboniferous, it is not unlikely\r\nthat the Devonian flora, like that of the Tertiary, appeared earlier in\r\nAmerica. It is also probable, as I have shown in the \"Reports\" already\r\nreferred to, that it appeared earlier in the Arctic than in the temperate\r\nzone. Hence an Arctic or American flora, really Devonian, may readily be\r\nmistaken for Lower Carboniferous by a botanist basing his calculations on\r\nthe fossils of temperate Europe. Even in America itself, it would appear,\r\nfrom recent discoveries in Virginia and Ohio, that certain Devonian forms\r\nlingered longer in those regions than farther to the northeast;[BX] and\r\nit would not be surprising if similar plants occurred in later beds in\r\nDevonshire or in the south of Europe than in Scotland. Still, these\r\nfacts, properly understood, do not invalidate the evidence of fossil\r\nplants as to geological age, though errors arising from the neglect of\r\nthem are still current.\r\n\r\n[BX] Andrews, \"Palæontology of Ohio,\" vol. ii.; Meek, \"Fossil Plants from\r\nWestern Virginia,\" Philosophical Society, Washington, 1875.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--Geological Relations of some Plant-bearing Beds of Eastern Canada.\r\n(\"Report on Erian Plants,\" 1871.)\r\n\r\nThe Gaspé sandstones have been fully described by Sir W. E. Logan,\r\nin his \"Report on the Geology of Canada,\" 1863. He there assigns to\r\nthem a thickness of seven thousand and thirty-six feet, and shows that\r\nthey rest conformably on the Upper Silurian limestones of the Lower\r\nHelderberg group (Ludlow), and are in their turn overlaid unconformably\r\nby the conglomerates which form the base of the Carboniferous rocks of\r\nNew Brunswick. I shall add here merely a few remarks on points in their\r\nphysical character connected with the occurrence of plants in them.\r\n\r\n_Prototaxites_ (_Nematophyton_) _Logani_ and other characteristic Lower\r\nErian plants occur in the base of the sandstones at Little Gaspé. This\r\nfact, along with the occurrence, as stated in my paper of 1863, of\r\nrhizomes of _Psilophyton_ preserving their scalariform structure, in\r\nthe upper part of the marine Upper Silurian limestones,[BY] proves the\r\nflora of the Devonian rocks to have had its beginning at least in the\r\nprevious geological period, and to characterise the lower as well as the\r\nupper beds of the Devonian series. In this connection I may state that,\r\nfrom their marine fossils, as well as their stratigraphical arrangement,\r\nSir W. E. Logan and Mr. Billings regard the lower portions of the Gaspé\r\nsandstones as the equivalents of the Oriskany sandstone of New York.\r\nOn the other hand, the great thickness of this formation, the absence\r\nof Lower Devonian fossils from its upper part, and the resemblance of\r\nthe upper beds to those of the newer members of the Devonian elsewhere,\r\nrender it probable that the Gaspé sandstones, though deficient in the\r\ncalcareous members of the system, seen farther to the westward, represent\r\nthe whole of the Devonian period.\r\n\r\n[BY] The marine fossils of these beds have been determined by Mr.\r\nBillings. They are Upper Silurian, with an intermixture of Lower Devonian\r\nin the upper part. Fragments of _Nematophyton_ occur in beds of the same\r\nage in the Bay des Chaleurs, at Cape Bon Ami.\r\n\r\nThe Gaspé sandstones, as their name imports, are predominantly\r\narenaceous, and often coarsely so, the sandstones being frequently\r\ncomposed of large grains and studded with quartz-pebbles. Grey and buff\r\nare prevalent colours, but red beds also occur, more especially in the\r\nupper portion. There are also interstratified shaly beds, sometimes\r\noccurring in groups of considerable thickness, and associated with\r\nfine-grained and laminated argillaceous sandstone, the whole having\r\nin many places the lithological aspect of the coal-measures. At one\r\nplace, near the middle of the series, there is a bed of coal from one\r\ninch to three inches in thickness, associated with highly bituminous\r\nshales abounding in remains of plants, and also containing fragments\r\nof crustaceans and fishes (_Pterygotus_, _Ctenacanthus ?_ &c). The\r\nbeds connected with this coal are grey sandstones and grey and dark\r\nshales, much resembling those of the ordinary coal formation. The\r\ncoal is shining and laminated, and both its roof and floor consist of\r\nlaminated bituminous shale with fragments of _Psilophyton_. It has no\r\ntrue under-clay, and has been, I believe, a peaty mass of rhizomes of\r\n_Psilophyton_. It occurs near Tar Point, on the south side of Gaspé Bay,\r\na place so named from the occurrence of a thick dyke of trap holding\r\npetroleum in its cavities. The coal is of considerable horizontal extent,\r\nas in its line of strike a similar bed has been discovered on the Douglas\r\nRiver, about four miles distant. It has not been recognised on the north\r\nside of the bay, though we find there beds, probably on very nearly the\r\nsame horizon, holding _Psilophyton_ in situ.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of one of the groups of shaly beds, and of the\r\noccurrence of roots of _Psilophyton_, I may give the following sectional\r\nlist of beds seen near \"Watering Brook,\" on the north shore of the bay.\r\nThe order is descending:\r\n\r\n                                                             FT.

Hard grey clay or shale, with fragments and roots of\r\n       _Psilophyton_                                          4   0\r\n  6. Red shale                                                8   0\r\n  7. Grey and reddish crumbling sandstone\r\n\r\nGroups of beds similar to the above, but frequently much more rich in\r\nfossils, occur in many parts of the section, and evidently include fossil\r\nsoils of the nature of under-clays, on which little else appears to have\r\ngrown than a dense herbage of _Psilophyton_, along with plants of the\r\ngenus _Arthrostigma_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these shaly groups, there are numerous examples of beds of\r\nshale of small thickness included in coarse sandstones, and these beds\r\noften occur in detached fragments, as if the remnants of more continuous\r\nlayers partially removed by currents of water. It is deserving of notice\r\nthat nearly all these patches of shale are interlaced with roots or\r\nstems of _Psilophyton_, which sometimes project beyond their limits into\r\nthe sandstone, as if the vegetable fibres had preserved the clay from\r\nremoval. In short, these lines of patches of shale seem to be remnants\r\nof soils on which _Psilophyton_ has flourished abundantly, and which\r\nhave been partially swept away by the currents which deposited the sand.\r\nSome of the smaller patches may even be fragments of tough swamp soils\r\ninterwoven with roots, drifted by the agency of the waves or possibly by\r\nice; such masses are often moved in this way on the borders of modern\r\nswamps on the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining point connected with local geology to which I shall\r\nallude is the admirable facilities afforded by the Gaspé coast both for\r\nascertaining the true geological relations of the beds, and for studying\r\nthe Devonian plants, as distinctly exposed on large surfaces of rock.\r\nOn the coast of the river St. Lawrence, at Cape Rozier and its vicinity,\r\nthe Lower Silurian rocks of the Quebec group are well exposed, and are\r\noverlaid unconformably by the massive Upper Silurian limestones of Cape\r\nGaspé, which rise into cliffs six hundred feet in height, and can be\r\nseen filled with their characteristic fossils on both sides of the cape.\r\nResting upon these, and dipping at high angles toward Gaspé Bay, are the\r\nDevonian sandstones, which are exposed in rugged cliffs slightly oblique\r\nto their line of strike, along a coast-line of ten miles in length, to\r\nthe head of the bay. On the opposite side of the bay they reappear; and,\r\nthrown into slight undulations by three anticlinal curves, occupy a\r\nline of coast fifteen miles in length. The perfect manner in which the\r\nplant-bearing beds are exposed in these fine natural sections may serve\r\nto account for the completeness with which the forms and habits of growth\r\nof the more abundant species can be described.\r\n\r\nIn the Bay des Chaleurs, similar rocks exist with some local variations.\r\nIn the vicinity of Campbellton are calcareous and magnesian breccia\r\nor agglomerate, hard shales, conglomerates and sandstones of Lower\r\nDevonian age. The agglomerate and lower shales contain abundant remains\r\nof fishes of the genera _Cephalaspis_, _Coccosteus_, _Ctenacanthus_,\r\nand _Homacanthus_, and also fragments of _Pterygotus_. The shales\r\nand sandstones abound in remains of _Psilophyton_, with which are\r\n_Nematophyton_, _Arthrostigma_, and _Leptophleum_ of the same species\r\nfound in the Lower Devonian of Gaspé Bay. These beds near Campbellton dip\r\nto the northward, and the Restigouche River here occupies a synclinal,\r\nfor on the opposite side, at Bordeaux Quarry, there are thick beds of\r\ngrey sandstone dipping to the southward, and containing large silicified\r\ntrunks of Prototaxites, in addition to _Psilophyton_. These beds are\r\nall undoubtedly Lower Erian, but farther to the eastward, on the north\r\nside of the river, there are newer and overlying strata. These are best\r\nseen at Scaumenac Bay, opposite Dalhousie, between Cape Florissant\r\nand Maguacha Point, where they consist of laminated and fine-grained\r\nsandstone, with shales of grey colours, but holding some reddish beds\r\nat top, and overlaid unconformably by a great thickness of Lower\r\nCarboniferous red conglomerate and sandstone. In these beds numerous\r\nfossil fishes have been found, among which Mr. Whiteaves recognises\r\nspecies of _Pterichthys_, _Glyptolepis_, _Cheirolepis_, &c. With these\r\nare found somewhat plentifully four species of fossil ferns, all of Upper\r\nErian types, of which one is peculiar to this locality; but the others\r\nare found in the Upper Erian of Perry, in Maine, or in the Cat skill\r\ngroup of New York.\r\n\r\nIn order that distinct notions may be conveyed as to the geological\r\nhorizons of the species, I may state that the typical Devonian or Erian\r\nseries of Canada and New York may be divided in descending order into--1.\r\nThe Chemung group, including the Chemung and Portage sandstones and\r\nshales. 2. The Hamilton group, including the Genesee, Hamilton, and\r\nMarcellus shales. 3. The Corniferous limestone and its associated beds.\r\n4 The Oriskany sandstone. As the Corniferous limestone, which is the\r\nequivalent of the Lower Carboniferous limestone in the Carboniferous\r\nperiod, is marine, and affords scarcely any plants, we may, as is usually\r\ndone for like purposes in the Carboniferous, group it with the Oriskany\r\nunder the name Lower Erian. The Hamilton rocks will then be Middle Erian,\r\nand the Chemung group Upper Erian. In the present state of our knowledge,\r\nthe series may be co-ordinated with the rocks of Gaspé, New Brunswick,\r\nand Maine, as in the following table:\r\n\r\n                |    New York    |   Gaspé      |  Southern    |  Coast\r\n  Subdivisions. |      and       | and Bay des  |    New       |   of\r\n                | Western Canada.|  Chaleurs.   |  Brunswick.  |  Maine.\r\n  --------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+-----------\r\n      Upper     |    Chemung     |   Upper      |Mispec Group. |  Perry\r\n   Devonian or  |     Group.     | Sandstones.  |   Shale,     |Sandstones.\r\n     Erian.     |                |Long Cove, &c.|  Sandstone,  |\r\n                |                |  Scauminac   |    and       |\r\n                |                |    Beds.     |Conglomerate. |\r\n                |                |              |              |\r\n      Middle    |   Hamilton     |   Middle     |  Little R.   |\r\n   Devonian or  |    Group.      | Sandstones.  |    Group     |\r\n      Erian.    |                | Bois Brulé,  |  (including  |\r\n                |                | Cape Oiseau, |   Cordaite   |\r\n                |                |     &c.      |  Shales and  |\r\n                |                |              |   Dadoxylon  |\r\n                |                |              |   Sandstone).|\r\n                |                |              |              |\r\n     Lower      |  Corniferous   |    Lower     |    Lower     |\r\n   Devonian or  |      and       |  Sandstones. |Conglomerates,|\r\n     Erian.     |    Oriskany    | Gaspé Basin, |      &c.     |\r\n                |    groups.     | Little Gaspé,|              |\r\n                |                |      &c.     |              |\r\n                |                | Campbellton  |              |\r\n                |                |     Beds.    |              |\r\n  --------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+-----------\r\n\r\nIt may be proper, before closing this note, to state the reasons which\r\nhave induced me to suggest in the following pages the use of the term\r\n\"Erian,\" as equivalent to \"Devonian,\" for the great system of formations\r\nintervening between the Upper Silurian and the Lower Carboniferous in\r\nAmerica. I have been induced to adopt this course by the following\r\nconsiderations: 1. The great area of undisturbed and unaltered rocks\r\nof this age, including a thickness in some places of eighteen thousand\r\nfeet, and extending from east to west through the Northern States of the\r\nUnion and western Canada for nearly seven hundred miles, while it spreads\r\nfrom north to south from the northern part of Michigan far into the\r\nMiddle States, is undoubtedly the most important Devonian area now known\r\nto geologists. 2. This area has been taken by all American geologists\r\nas their typical Devonian region. It is rich in fossils, and these have\r\nbeen thoroughly studied and admirably illustrated by the New York and\r\nCanadian Surveys. 3. The rocks of this area surround the basin of Lake\r\nErie, and were named, in the original reports of the New York Survey,\r\nthe \"_Erie Division_\" 4. Great difficulties have been experienced in\r\nthe classification of the European Devonian, and the uncertainties thus\r\narising have tended to throw doubt on the results obtained in America in\r\ncircumstances in which such difficulties do not occur.\r\n\r\nThese reasons are, I think, sufficient to warrant me in holding the great\r\n_Erie Division_ of the New York geologists as the typical representative\r\nof the rocks deposited between the close of the Upper Silurian and the\r\nbeginning of the Carboniferous period, and to use the term Erian as the\r\ndesignation of this great series of deposits as developed in America,\r\nin so far at least as their flora is concerned. In doing so, I do not\r\nwish to introduce a new name merely for the sake of novelty; but I hope\r\nto keep before the minds of geologists the caution that they should\r\nnot measure the Erian formations of America, or the fossils which they\r\ncontain, by the comparatively depauperated representatives of this\r\nportion of the geological scale in the Devonian of western Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--On the Relations of the so-called \"Ursa Stage\" of Bear Island with\r\nthe Palæozoic Flora of North America.\r\n\r\nThe following note is a verbatim copy of that published by me in\r\n1873, and the accuracy of which has now been vindicated by the recent\r\nobservations of Nathorst:\r\n\r\nThe plants catalogued by Dr. Heer, and characterising what he calls\r\nthe \"Ursa Stage,\" are in part representatives of those of the American\r\nflora which I have described as the \"Lower Carboniferous Coal-Measures\"\r\n(Subcarboniferous of Dana), and whose characteristic species, as\r\ndeveloped in Nova Scotia, I noticed in the \"Journal of the Geological\r\nSociety\" in 1858 (vol. xv.). Dr. Heer's list, however, includes some\r\nUpper Devonian forms; and I would suggest that either the plants of two\r\ndistinct beds, one Lower Carboniferous and the other Upper Devonian, have\r\nbeen near to or in contact with each other and have been intermixed, or\r\nelse that in this high northern latitude, in which (for reasons stated\r\nin my \"Report on the Devonian Flora\"[BZ]) I believe the Devonian plants\r\nto have originated, there was an actual intermixture of the two floras.\r\nIn America, at the base of the Carboniferous of Ohio, a transition of\r\nthis kind seems to occur; but elsewhere in northeastern America the Lower\r\nCarboniferous plants are usually unmixed with the Devonian.\r\n\r\n[BZ] \"Geological Survey of Canada,\" 1871.\r\n\r\nDr. Heer, however, proceeds to identify these plants with those of the\r\nAmerican Chemung, and even with those of the Middle Devonian of New\r\nBrunswick, as described by me--a conclusion from which I must altogether\r\ndissent, inasmuch as the latter belong to beds which were disturbed and\r\npartially metamorphosed before the deposition of the lowest Carboniferous\r\nor \"Subcarboniferous\" beds.\r\n\r\nDr. Heer's error seems to have arisen from want of acquaintance with the\r\nrich flora of the Middle Devonian, which, while differing in species, has\r\nmuch resemblance in its general facies, and especially in its richness in\r\nferns, to that of the coal-formation.\r\n\r\nTo geologists acquainted with the stratigraphy and the accompanying\r\nanimal fossils, Dr. Heer's conclusions will of course appear untenable;\r\nbut they may regard them as invalidating the evidence of fossil plants;\r\nand for this reason it is, I think, desirable to give publicity to the\r\nabove statements.\r\n\r\nI consider the British equivalent of the lower coal-measures of eastern\r\nAmerica to be the lower limestone shales, the _Tweedian group_ of Mr.\r\nTate (1858), but which have sometimes been called the \"Calciferous\r\nSandstone\" (a name preoccupied for a Cambrian group in America). This\r\ngroup does not constitute \"beds of passage\" to the Devonian, more\r\nespecially in eastern America, where the lower coal-formation rests\r\nunconformably on the Devonian, and is broadly distinguished by its\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nThe above notes would not have been extended to so great length, but\r\nfor the importance of the Erian flora as the precursor of that of the\r\nCarboniferous, and the small amount of attention hitherto given to it by\r\ngeologists and botanists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  THE CARBONIFEROUS FLORA--CULMINATION OF THE\r\n  ACROGENS--FORMATION OF COAL.\r\n\r\nAscending from the Erian to the Carboniferous system, so called because\r\nit contains the greatest deposits of anthracite and bituminous coal, we\r\nare still within the limits of the Palæozoic period. We are still within\r\nthe reign of the gigantic club-mosses, cordaites, and taxine pines. At\r\nthe close of the Erian there had been over the whole northern hemisphere\r\ngreat changes of level, accompanied by active volcanic phenomena, and\r\nunder these influences the land flora seems to have much diminished. At\r\nlength all the old Erian species had become extinct, and their place was\r\nsupplied by a meagre group of lycopods, ferns, and pines of different\r\nspecies from those of the preceding Erian. This is the flora of the Lower\r\nCarboniferous series, the Tweedian of England, the Horton series of Nova\r\nScotia, the lower coal-measures of Virginia, the culm of Germany. But\r\nthe land again subsided, and the period of the marine limestone of the\r\nLower Carboniferous was introduced. In this the older flora disappeared,\r\nand when the land emerged we find it covered with the rich flora of the\r\ncoal-formation proper, in which the great tribes of the lycopods and\r\ncordaites attained their maxima, and the ferns were continued as before,\r\nthough under new generic and specific forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Foliage from the coal-formation, _a_,\r\n_Alethopteris lonchitica_, fern (Moose River). _b_, _Sphenophyllum\r\nSchlotheimii_ (Pietou). _c_, _Lepidodendron binerve_ (Sydney), _d_,\r\n_Asterophyllites foliosa_ (_?_) (Sydney). _e_, _Cordaites_ (Joggins).\r\n_f_, _Neuropteris rarinervis_, fern (Sydney). _g_, _Odontopteris\r\nsubcuneata_, fern (Sydney).]\r\n\r\nThere is something very striking in this succession of a new plant\r\nworld without any material advance. It is like passing in the modern\r\nworld from one district to another, in which we see the same forms of\r\nlife, only represented by distinct though allied species. Thus, when\r\nthe voyager crosses the Atlantic from Europe to America, he meets with\r\npines, oaks, birches, poplars, and beeches of the same genera with those\r\nhe had left behind; but the species are distinct. It is something like\r\nthis that meets us in our ascent into the Carboniferous world of plants.\r\nYet we know that this is a succession in time, that all our old Erian\r\nfriends are dead and buried long ago, and that these are new forms lately\r\nintroduced (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\nConveying ourselves, then, in imagination forward to the time when our\r\ngreatest accumulations of coal were formed, and fancying that we are\r\nintroduced to the American or European continent of that period, we find\r\nourselves in a new and strange world. In the Devonian age, and even in\r\nthe succeeding Lower Carboniferous, there was in the interior of America\r\na wide inland sea, with forest belts clinging to its sides or clothing\r\nits islands. But in the coal period this inland sea had given place\r\nto vast swampy flats, and which, instead of the oil-bearing shales\r\nof the Erian, were destined to produce those immense and wide-spread\r\naccumulations of vegetable matter which constitute our present beds of\r\nbituminous and anthracite coal. The atmosphere of these great swamps\r\nis moist and warm. Their vegetation is most exuberant, but of forms\r\nunfamiliar to modern eyes, and they swarm with insects, millipedes, and\r\nscorpions, and with batrachian reptiles large and small, among which we\r\nlook in vain for representatives of the birds and beasts of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--_Sigillariæ_, restored.

See\r\nappended note.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Stem of _Sigillaria Brownii_. reduced. Natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Two ribs of _Sigillaria Brownii_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Portion of lower part of stem of _S. Brownii_.\r\nNatural size.]\r\n\r\nProminent among the more gigantic trees of these swampy forests are\r\nthose known to us as _Sigillariæ_ (Fig. 33). They have tall, pillar-like\r\ntrunks, often several feet in diameter, ribbed like fluted columns, but\r\nin the reverse way, and spreading at the top into a few thick branches,\r\nwhich are clothed with long, grass-like leaves. They resemble in some\r\nrespects the Lepidodendra of the Erian age, but are more massive, with\r\nribbed instead of scaly trunks, and longer leaves. If we approach one\r\nof them more closely, we are struck with the regular ribs of its trunk,\r\ndotted with rows of scars of fallen leaves, from which it receives its\r\nname _Sigillaria_, or seal-tree (Figs. 34-37). If we cut into its stem,\r\nwe find that, instead of the thin bark and firm wood with which we are\r\nfamiliar in our modern trees, it has a hard external rind, then a great\r\nthickness of cellular matter with rope-like bands of fibres, constituting\r\nan inner bark, while in the centre is a firm, woody axis of comparatively\r\nsmall diameter, and somewhat intermediate in its structures between that\r\nof the Lepidodendra and those of the cycads and the taxine conifers.\r\nThus a great stem, five feet in diameter, may consist principally of\r\ncellular and bast fibres with very little true woody matter. The roots\r\nof this tree are perhaps its most singular feature. They usually start\r\nfrom the stem in four main branches, then regularly bifurcate several\r\ntimes, and then run out into great cylindrical cables, running for a\r\nlong distance, and evidently intended to anchor the plant firmly in a\r\nsoft and oozy soil. They were furnished with long, cylindrical rootlets\r\nplaced regularly in a spiral manner, and so articulated that when they\r\ndropped off they left regular rounded scars. They are, in short, the\r\n_Stigmariæ_, which we have already met with in the Erian (Figs. 38, 39).\r\nIn Fig. 33 I have endeavoured to restore these strange trees. It is not\r\nwonderful that such plants have caused much botanical controversy. It was\r\nlong before botanists could be convinced that their roots are properly\r\nroots at all, and not stems of some aquatic plant. Then the structure of\r\ntheir stems is most puzzling, and their fruit is an enigma, for while\r\nsome have found connected with them cones supposed to resemble those of\r\nlycopods, others attribute to them fruits like those of yew-trees. For\r\nyears I have been myself gathering materials from the rich coal-formation\r\ndeposits of Nova Scotia in aid of the solution of these questions, and\r\nin the mean time Dr. Williamson, of Manchester, and Renault and other\r\nbotanists in France, have been amassing and studying stores of specimens,\r\nand it is still uncertain who may finally be the fortunate discoverer\r\nto set all controversies at rest. My present belief is, that the true\r\nsolution consists in the fact that there are many kinds of _Sigillariæ_.\r\nWhile in the modern forests of America and Europe the species of any of\r\nour ordinary trees, as oaks, birches, or maples, may almost be counted\r\non one's fingers, Schimper in his vegetable palæontology enumerates\r\nabout eighty species of Carboniferous _Sigillariæ_; and while on the one\r\nhand many of these are so imperfectly known that they may be regarded\r\nas uncertain, on the other hand many species must yet remain to be\r\ndiscovered.[CA] Now, in so vast a number of species there must be a\r\ngreat range of organisation, and, indeed, it has already been attempted\r\nto subdivide them into several generic groups. The present state of the\r\nquestion appears to me to be this, that in these _Sigillariæ_ we have\r\na group divisible into several forms, some of which will eventually be\r\nclassed with the Lepidodendra as lycopods, while others will be found\r\nto be naked-seeded phænogams, allied to the pines and cycads, and to a\r\nremarkable group of trees known as _Cordaites_, which we must shortly\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n[CA] In a recent memoir (Berlin, 1887) Stur has raised the number of\r\nspecies in one subdivision of the _Sigillariæ_ (the _Favulariæ_) to\r\nforty-seven!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--_Stigmaria_ root, seen from above, showing its\r\nregular divisions. From \"Acadian Geology\".]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Portion of bark of _Stigmaria_, showing scars of\r\nattachment of rootlets.]\r\n\r\nBefore considering other forms of Carboniferous vegetation, let us\r\nglance at the accumulation of coal, and the agency of the forests of\r\n_Sigillariæ_ therein. Let us imagine, in the first instance, such trees\r\nas those represented in the figures, growing thickly together over vast\r\nswampy flats, with quantities of undergrowth of ferns and other plants\r\nbeneath their shade, and accumulating from age to age in a moist soil\r\nand climate a vast thickness of vegetable mould and trunks of trees, and\r\nspores and spore-cases, and we have the conditions necessary for the\r\ngrowth of coal. Many years ago it was observed by Sir William Logan that\r\nin the coal-field of South Wales it was the rule with rare exceptions\r\nthat, under every bed of coal, there is a bed of clay filled with roots\r\nof the _Stigmaria_, already referred to as the root of _Sigillaria_. This\r\ndiscovery has since been extended to all the coal-fields of Europe and\r\nAmerica, and it is a perfectly conclusive fact as regards the origin of\r\ncoal. Each of these \"under-clays,\" as they are called, must, in fact,\r\nhave been a soil on which grew, in the first instance, Sigillariæ and\r\nother trees having stigmaria-roots. Thus, the growth of a forest of\r\n_Sigillariæ_ was the first step toward the accumulation of a bed of\r\ncoal. More than this, in some of the coarser and more impure coals,\r\nwhere there has been sufficient earthy matter to separate and preserve\r\nimpressions of vegetable forms, we can see that the mass of the coal is\r\nmade up of flattened _Sigillariæ_, mixed with vegetable _débris_ of all\r\nkinds, including sometimes vast quantities of lepidodendroid spores,\r\nand the microscopic study of the coal gives similar results (Fig. 40).\r\nFurther, on the surfaces of many coals, and penetrating the shales or\r\nsandstones which form their roofs, we find erect stumps of sigillaria\r\nand other trees, showing that the accumulation of the coal terminated as\r\nit had begun, by a forest-growth. I introduce here a section of a few of\r\nthe numerous beds of coal exposed in the cliffs of the South Joggins, in\r\nNova Scotia, in illustration of these facts. We can thus see how in the\r\nslowly subsiding areas of the coal-swamps successive beds of coal were\r\naccumulated, alternating with beds of sandstone and shale (Figs. 41, 42).\r\nFor other details of this kind I must refer to papers mentioned in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Vegetable tissues from coal. _a_, _Sigillaria_\r\nand _Cordaites_. _Calamodendron_.]\r\n\r\nReturning to the more special subject of this work, I may remark that the\r\nlepidodendroid trees and the ferns, both the arborescent and herbaceous\r\nkinds, are even more richly represented in the Carboniferous than in the\r\npreceding Erian, I must, however, content myself with merely introducing\r\na few representatives of some of the more common kinds, in an appended\r\nnote, and here give a figure of a well-known Lower Carboniferous\r\nlepidodendron, with its various forms of leaf-bases, and its foliage and\r\nfruit (Fig. 43), and a similar illustration of an allied generic form,\r\nthat known as _Lepidophloios_[CB] (Fig. 44).\r\n\r\n[CB] For full descriptions of these, see \"Acadian Geology.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Beds associated with the main coal (S.

They\r\nbear, in habit of growth and fructification, a close relation to our\r\nmodern equisetums, or mare's-tails, but, as in other cases we have met\r\nwith, are of gigantic size and comparatively complex structure. Their\r\nstems, in cross-section, show radiating bundles of fibres, like those\r\nof exogenous woods, yet the whole plan of structure presents some\r\ncurious resemblances to the stems of their humble successors, the modern\r\nmare's-tails. It would seem, from the manner in which dense brakes of\r\nthese _Calamites_ have been preserved in the coal-formation of Nova\r\nScotia, that they spread over low and occasionally inundated flats, and\r\nformed fringes on the seaward sides of the great Sigillaria forests.\r\nIn this way they no doubt contributed to prevent the invasion of the\r\nareas of coal accumulation by the muddy waters of inundations, and thus,\r\nthough they may not have furnished much of the material of coal, they\r\nno doubt contributed to its purity. Many beautiful plants of the genera\r\nAsterophyllites and _Annularia_ are supposed to have been allied to the\r\n_Calamites_, or to have connected them with the _Rhizocarps_. The stems\r\nand fruit of these plants have strong points of resemblance to those of\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, and the leaves are broad, and not narrow and angular\r\nlike those of the true _Calamites_ (Fig. 45).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Erect _Sigillaria_, standing on a coal-seam (S.\r\nJoggins, Nova Scotia).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--_Lepidodendron corrugatum_, Dawson, a tree\r\ncharacteristic of the Lower Carboniferous, A, Restoration.

The structure of\r\nthe stem is, indeed, so complex, and differs so much in different\r\nstages of growth, and different states of preservation, that we are\r\nin danger of falling into the greatest confusion in classifying these\r\nplants. Sometimes what we call a Calamite is a mere cast of its pith\r\nshowing longitudinal striæ and constrictions at the nodes. Sometimes\r\nwe have the form of the outer surface of the woody cylinder, showing\r\nlongitudinal ribs, nodes, and marks of the emission of the branchlets.\r\nSometimes we have the outer surface of the plant covered with a smooth\r\nbark showing flat ribs, or almost smooth, and having at the nodes regular\r\narticulations with the bases of the verticillate branchlets, or on the\r\nlower part of the stem the marks of the attachment of the roots. The\r\nCalamites grew in dense clumps, budding off from one another, sometimes\r\nat different levels, as the mud or sand accumulated about their stems,\r\nand in some species there were creeping rhizomata or root-stocks (Figs.\r\n46 to 49).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--_Calamites_. A, _C. Suckovii_. B, _C. Cistii_.\r\n(From \"Acadian Geology.\")]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Erect _Calamites_, with roots attached (Nova\r\nScotia).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Node of _C. Cistii_, with long leaves (Nova\r\nScotia).]\r\n\r\nBut all Calamites were not alike in structure. In a recent paper[CC]\r\nDr. Williamson describes three distinct structural types. What he\r\nregards as typical Calamites has in its woody zone wedges of barred\r\nvessels, with thick bands of cellular tissue separating them. A second\r\ntype, which he refers to _Calamopitus_, has woody bundles composed of\r\nreticulated or multiporous fibres, with their porous sides parallel to\r\nthe medullary rays, which are better developed than in the previous form.\r\nThe intervening cellular masses are composed of elongated cells. This is\r\na decided advance in structure, and is of the type of those forms having\r\nthe most woody and largest stems, which Brongniart named _Calamodendron_\r\n(Fig. 50). A third form, to which Dr. Williamson seems to prefer to\r\nassign this last name, has the tissue of the woody wedges barred, as\r\nin the first, but the medullary rays are better developed than in the\r\nsecond. In this third form the intermediate tissue, or primary medullary\r\nrays, is truly fibrous, and with secondary medullary rays traversing\r\nit. My own observations lead me to infer that there was a fourth type\r\nof calamitean stem, less endowed with woody matter, and having a\r\nlarger fistulous or cellular cavity than any of those described by Dr.\r\nWilliamson.\r\n\r\n[CC] \"Memoirs of the Philosophical Society,\" Manchester, 1886-'87.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Erect _Calamites_ (_C. Suckovii_), showing the\r\nmode of growth of new stems (_b_), and different forms of the ribs (_a_,\r\n_c_). (Pictou, Nova Scotia.) Half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that all these various and complicated\r\nstems belonged to higher and nobler types of mare's-tails than those of\r\nthe modern world, and that their fructification was equisetaceous and of\r\nthe form known as _Calamostachys_.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that noble tree-ferns existed in the Erian period,\r\nand these were continued, and their number and variety greatly extended,\r\nin the Carboniferous. In regard to the structure of their stems, and the\r\nmethod of supporting these by aërial roots, the tree-ferns of all ages\r\nhave been nearly alike, and the form and structure of the leaves, except\r\nin some comparatively rare and exceptional types, has also been much the\r\nsame. Any ordinary observer examining a collection of coal-formation\r\nferns recognises at once their kinship to the familiar brackens of our\r\nown time. Their fructification is, unfortunately, rarely preserved, so\r\nthat we are not able, in the case of many species, to speak confidently\r\nof their affinities with modern forms; but the knowledge of this subject\r\nhas been constantly extending, and a sufficient amount of information\r\nhas been obtained to enable us to say something as to their probable\r\nrelationships. (Figs. 51 to 55.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Stems of _Calamodendron_ and tissues magnified\r\n(Nova Scotia), _a_, _b_, Casts of axis in sandstone, with woody envelope\r\n(reduced). _c_, _d_, Woody tissue (highly magnified).]\r\n\r\nThe families into which modern ferns are divided are, it must be\r\nconfessed, somewhat artificial, and in the case of fossil ferns, in\r\nwhich the fructification is for the most part wanting, it is still more\r\nso, depending in great part on the form and venation of the divisions\r\nof the fronds. Of about eight families into which modern ferns are\r\ndivided, seven are found in a fossil state, and of these, four at least,\r\nthe _Cyathaceæ_, the _Ophioglosseæ_, the _Hymenophyllaceæ_, and the\r\n_Marattiaceæ_, go back to the coal-formation.[CD]\r\n\r\n[CD] Mr. R. Kidston has recently described very interesting forms of fern\r\nfructification from the coal-formation of Great Britain, and much has\r\nbeen done by European palæobotanists, and also by Lesquereux and Fontaine\r\nin America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Group of coal-formation ferns, A, _Odontopteris\r\nsubcuneata_ (Bunbury), B, _Neuropteris cordata_ (Brongniart).

D, _Acadica_, scars half natural size.]\r\n\r\nSome of these ferns have the more complex kind of spore-case, with a\r\njointed, elastic ring. It is to be observed, however, that those forms\r\nwhich have a simple spore-case, either netted or membranous, and without\r\nannulus, are most common in the Devonian and lowest Carboniferous.\r\nSome of the forms in these old rocks are somewhat difficult to place\r\nin the system. Of these, the species of _Archæopteris_, of the Upper\r\nand Middle Erian, are eminent as examples. This type, however, scarcely\r\nextends as high as the coal-formation.[CE] Some of the tree-ferns of the\r\nCarboniferous present very remarkable features. One of these, of the\r\ngenus _Megaphyton_, seems to have two rows of great leaves, one at each\r\nside of the stem, which was probably sustained by large bundles of aërial\r\nroots (Fig. 56).\r\n\r\n[CE] The pretty little ferns of the genus _Botrychium_ (moonwort), so\r\ncommon in American and European woods, seem to be their nearest modern\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous, as in the Erian, there are leaves which have been\r\nreferred to ferns, but are subject to doubt, as possibly belonging to\r\nbroad-leaved taxine trees allied to the gingko-tree of China. One of\r\nthese, represented in Fig. 57, has been found in the coal-formation of\r\nNova Scotia, and referred to the doubtful genus _Noeggerathia_. Fontaine\r\nhas proposed for similar leaves found in Virginia the new generic name\r\n_Saportea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--_Noeggerathia disbar_ (half natural size).]\r\n\r\nFerns, as might be inferred from their great age, are at the present time\r\ndispersed over the whole world; but their headquarters, and the regions\r\nto which tree-ferns are confined, are the more moist climates of the\r\ntropics and of the southern hemisphere. The coal-swamps of the northern\r\nhemisphere seem to have excelled even these favoured regions of the\r\npresent world as a paradise for ferns.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the Carboniferous constitutes the headquarters\r\nof the _Cordaites_ (Fig. 58), of which a large number of species have\r\nbeen described, both in Europe and America. We sometimes, though\r\nrarely, find their stems showing structure. In this case we have a\r\nlarge cellular pith, often divided by horizontal partitions into flat\r\nchambers, and constituting the objects which, when detached, are called\r\n_Sternbergiæ_ (Fig. 62). These Sternbergia piths, however, occur in true\r\nconifers as well, as they do in the modern world in some trees, like our\r\ncommon butternut, of higher type; and I showed many years ago that the\r\nSternbergia type may be detected in the young twigs of the balsam-fir\r\n(_Abies balsamifera_). The pith was surrounded by a ring of scalariform\r\nor barred tissue, often of considerable thickness, and in young stems so\r\nimportant as to have suggested lycopodiaceous affinities. But as the stem\r\ngrew in size, a regular ring of woody wedges, with tissue having rounded\r\nor hexagonal pores or discs, like those of pines, was developed. Outside\r\nthis was a bark, often apparently of some thickness. This structure in\r\nmany important points resembles that of cycads, and also approaches to\r\nthe structure of Sigillaria, while in its more highly developed forms it\r\napproximates to that of the conifers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--_Cordaites_ (_Dorycordaites_), Grand d'Eury,\r\nreduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Fruits of _Cordaites_ and Taxine Conifers\r\n(coal-formation.

The fruit consisted of racemes, or\r\nclusters of nutlets, which seem to have been provided with broad lateral\r\nwings for flotation in the air, or in some cases with a pulpy envelope,\r\nwhich flattens into a film. There seem to have been structures of both\r\nthese kinds, though in the state of preservation of these curious seeds\r\nit is extremely difficult to distinguish them. In the first case they\r\nmust have been intended for dissemination by the wind, like the seeds\r\nof spruces. In the latter case they may have been disseminated like the\r\nfruits of taxine trees by the agency of animals, though what these were\r\nit would be difficult to guess. These trees had very great reproductive\r\npower, since they produced numerous seeds, not singly or a few together,\r\nas in modern yews, but in long spikes or catkins bearing many seeds (Fig.\r\n59).\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the Cordaites, or the _Cordaitinæ_, as\r\nthey have been called, as a family,[CF] constitute another of those\r\nintermediate groups with which we have already become familiar. On\r\nthe one hand they approach closely to the broader-leaved yews like\r\nGingko, Phyllocladus, and Podocarpus, and, on the other hand, they\r\nhave affinities with Cycadaceæ, and even with Sigillariæ. They were\r\nbeautiful and symmetrical trees, adding something to the variety of the\r\nrather monotonous Palæozoic forests. They contributed also somewhat to\r\nthe accumulation of coal. I have found that some thin beds are almost\r\nentirely composed of their leaves, and the tissues of their wood are not\r\ninfrequent in the mineral charcoal of the larger coal-seams. There is\r\nno evidence that their roots were of the stigmaroid type, though they\r\nevidently grew in the same swampy flats with the Sigillariæ and Calamites.\r\n\r\n[CF] Engler; Cordaitées of Renault.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be well to say here that I believe there was a\r\nconsiderably wide range of organisation in the Cordaitinæ as well as in\r\nthe Calamites and Sigillariæ, and that it will eventually be found that\r\nthere were three lines of connection between the higher cryptogams and\r\nthe phænogams, one leading from the lycopods by the Sigillariæ, another\r\nleading by the Cordaites, and the third leading from the Equisetums by\r\nthe Calamites. Still further back the characters afterward separated in\r\nthe club-mosses, mare's-tails, and ferns, were united in the Rhizocarps,\r\nor, as some now, but I think somewhat unreasonably, prefer to call\r\nthem, the \"heterosporous Filicinæ.\" In the more modern world, all the\r\nconnecting links have become extinct and the phænogams stand widely\r\nseparated from the higher cryptogams. I do not make these remarks in\r\na Darwinian sense, but merely to state what appear to be the lines of\r\nnatural affinity and the links wanting to give unity to the system of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nOf all the trees of the modern world, none are perhaps so widely\r\ndistributed as the pines and their allies. On mountain-tops and\r\nwithin the Arctic zone, the last trees that can struggle against the\r\nunfavourable conditions of existence are the spruces and firs, and in\r\nthe warm and moist islands of the tropics they seem equally at home\r\nwith the tree-ferns and the palms. We have already seen that they are\r\na very ancient family, and in the sandstones of the coal-formation\r\ntheir great trunks are frequently found, infiltrated with calcareous or\r\nsilicious matter, and still retaining their structure in the greatest\r\nperfection (Fig. 60). So far as we know, the foliage of some of them\r\nwhich constitutes the genera _Walchia_ and _Araucarites_ of some authors\r\n(Figs. 60, 63) was not dissimilar from that of modern yews and spruces,\r\nthough there is reason to believe that some others had broad, fern-like\r\nleaves like those of the gingko. None of them, so far as yet certainly\r\nknown, were cone-bearing trees, their fruit having probably been similar\r\nto that of the yews (Fig. 61). The minute structures of their stems are\r\nnearer to those of the conifers of the islands of the southern hemisphere\r\nthan to that of those in our northern climes--a correlation, no doubt, to\r\nthe equable climate of the period. There is not much evidence that they\r\ngrew with the Sigillariæ in the true coal-swamps, though some specimens\r\nhave been found in this association. It is more likely that they were in\r\nthe main inland and upland trees, and that in consequence they are mostly\r\nknown to us by drifted trunks borne by river inundations into the seas\r\nand estuaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Coniferous wood and foliage (Carboniferous).

As Renault well remarks with reference to\r\nCordaites, the existence of this chambered form of pith implies rapid\r\nelongation of the stem, so that the Cordaites and conifers of the\r\ncoal-formation were probably quickly growing trees (Fig. 62).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--_Sternbergia_ pith of _Dadoxylon_.

In the coal period we have found none of\r\nthe higher exogens, and there are only obscure and uncertain indications\r\nof the presence of endogens, which we may reserve for a future chapter;\r\nbut gymnosperms abound and are highly characteristic. On the other hand,\r\nwe have no mosses or lichens, and very few Algæ, but a great number of\r\nferns and Lycopodiaceæ or club-mosses (Fig. 63). Thus, the coal-formation\r\nperiod is botanically a meeting-place of the lower phænogams and the\r\nhigher cryptogams, and presents many forms which, when imperfectly known,\r\nhave puzzled botanists in regard to their position in one or other\r\nseries. In the present world, the flora most akin to that of the coal\r\nperiod is that of warm, temperate regions in the southern hemisphere. It\r\nis not properly a tropical flora, nor is it the flora of a cold region,\r\nbut rather indicative of a moist and equable climate. Still, we must bear\r\nin mind that we may often be mistaken in reasoning as to the temperature\r\nrequired by extinct species of plants, differing from those now in\r\nexistence. Further, we must not assume that the climatal conditions of\r\nthe northern hemisphere were in the coal period at all similar to those\r\nwhich now prevail. As Sir Charles Lyell has shown, a less amount of land\r\nin the higher latitudes would greatly modify climates, and there is\r\nevery reason to believe that in the coal period there was less land than\r\nnow. Further, it has been shown by Tyndall that a very small additional\r\namount of carbonic acid in the atmosphere would, by obstructing the\r\nradiation of heat from the earth, produce almost the effect of a glass\r\nroof or conservatory, extending over the whole world. Again, there is\r\nmuch in the structure of the leaves of the coal-plants, as well as in\r\nthe vast amount of carbon which they accumulated in the form of coal,\r\nand the characteristics of the animal life of the period, to indicate,\r\non independent grounds, that the carboniferous atmosphere differed\r\nfrom that of the present world in this way, or in the presence of more\r\ncarbonic acid--a substance now existing in the very minute proportion\r\nof one thousandth of the whole--a quantity adapted to the present\r\nrequirements of vegetable and animal life, but probably not to those of\r\nthe coal period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--_Walchia imbricatula_, S. N., Permian, Prince\r\nEdward Island.]\r\n\r\nThus, if we inquire as to any analogous distribution of plants in the\r\nmodern world, we find this only in the warmer insular climates of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, where ferns, lycopods, and pines appear under forms\r\nsomewhat akin to those of the Carboniferous, but mixed with other types,\r\nsome of which are modern, others allied to those of the next succeeding\r\ngeological ages of the Mesozoic and Tertiary; and under these periods it\r\nwill be more convenient to make comparisons.\r\n\r\nThe readers of recent English popular works on geology will have observed\r\nthe statement reiterated that a large proportion of the material of\r\nthe great beds of bituminous coal is composed of the spore-cases of\r\nlycopodiaceous plants--a statement quite contrary to that resulting\r\nfrom my microscopical examinations of the coal of more than eighty\r\ncoal-beds in Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, as stated in \"Acadian Geology\"\r\n(page 463), and more fully in my memoir of 1858 on the \"Structures\r\nin Coal,\"[CG] and that of 1866, on the \"Conditions of Accumulation\r\nof Coal.\"[CH] The reason of this mistake is, that an eminent English\r\nnaturalist, happening to find in certain specimens of English coal a\r\ngreat quantity of remains of spores and spore-cases, though even in his\r\nspecimens they constitute only a small portion of the mass, and being\r\napparently unacquainted with what others had done in this field, wrote a\r\npopular article for the \"Contemporary Review,\" in which he extended an\r\nisolated and exceptional fact to all coals, and placed this supposed\r\norigin of coal in a light so brilliant and attractive that he has been\r\nfollowed by many recent writers. The fact is, as stated in \"Acadian\r\nGeology,\" that trunks of _Sigillariæ_ and similar trees constitute a\r\ngreat part of the denser portion of the coal, and that the cortical\r\ntissues of these rather than the wood remain as coal. But cortical or\r\nepidermal tissues in general, whether those of spore-cases or other\r\nparts of plants, are those which from their resistance to water-soakage\r\nand to decay, and from their highly carbonaceous character, are best\r\nsuited to the production of coal. In point of fact, spore-cases, though\r\noften abundantly present, constitute only an infinitesimal part of the\r\nmatter of the great coal-beds. In an article in \"The American Journal\r\nof Science,\" which appeared shortly after that above referred to, I\r\nendeavoured to correct this error, though apparently without effect in\r\nso far as the majority of British geological writers are concerned. From\r\nthis article I have taken with little change the following passages, as\r\nit is of importance in theoretical geology that such mistakes, involving\r\nas they do the whole theory of coal accumulation, should not continue to\r\npass current. The early part of the paper is occupied with facts as to\r\nthe occurrence of spores and spore-cases as partial ingredients in coal.\r\nIts conclusions are as follows: It is not improbable that sporangites,\r\nor bodies resembling them, may be found in most coals; but it is most\r\nlikely that their occurrence is accidental rather than essential to coal\r\naccumulation, and that they are more likely to have been abundant in\r\nshales and cannel coals, deposited in ponds or in shallow waters in the\r\nvicinity of lycopodiaceous forests, than in the swampy or peaty deposits\r\nwhich constitute the ordinary coals. It is to be observed, however,\r\nthat the conspicuous appearance which these bodies, and also the strips\r\nand fragments of epidermal tissue, which resemble them in texture,\r\npresent in slices of coal, may incline an observer, not having large\r\nexperience in the examination of coals, to overrate their importance; and\r\nthis I think has been done by most microscopists, especially those who\r\nhave confined their attention to slices prepared by the lapidary. One\r\nmust also bear in mind the danger arising from mistaking concretionary\r\naccumulations of bituminous matter for sporangia. In sections of the\r\nbituminous shales accompanying the Devonian coal above mentioned, there\r\nare many rounded yellow spots, which on examination prove to be the\r\nspaces in the epidermis of _Psilophyton_ through which the vessels\r\npassing to the leaves were emitted. To these considerations I would add\r\nthe following, condensed from the paper above referred to (p. 139), in\r\nwhich the whole question of the origin of coal is fully discussed:[CI]\r\n\r\n[CG] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" vol. xv.\r\n\r\n[CH] _Ibid._, vol. xxii.\r\n\r\n[CI] See also \"Acadian Geology,\" 2d ed., pp. 138, 461, 493.\r\n\r\n1. The mineral charcoal or 'mother coal' is obviously woody tissue\r\nand fibres of bark, the structure of the varieties of which, and the\r\nplants to which it probably belongs, I have discussed in the paper above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n2. The coarser layers of coal show under the microscope a confused mass\r\nof fragments of vegetable matter belonging to various descriptions of\r\nplants, and including, but not usually in large quantities, sporangites.\r\n\r\n3. The more brilliant layers of the coal are seen, when separated by thin\r\nlaminæ of clay, to have on their surfaces the markings of _Sigillariæ_\r\nand other trees, of which they evidently represent flattened specimens,\r\nor rather the bark of such specimens. Under the microscope, when their\r\nstructures are preserved, these layers show cortical tissues more\r\nabundantly than any others.\r\n\r\n4. Some thin layers of coal consist mainly of flattened layers of leaves\r\nof _Cordaites_ or _Pychnophyllum_.\r\n\r\n5. The _Stigmaria_ under-clays and the stumps of _Sigillaria_ in the\r\ncoal-roofs equally testify to the accumulation of coal by the growth of\r\nsuccessive forests, more especially of _Sigillariæ_. There is, on the\r\nother hand, no necessary connection of sporangite-beds with Stigmarian\r\nsoils. Such beds are more likely to be accumulated in water, and\r\nconsequently to constitute bituminous shales and cannels.\r\n\r\n6. _Lepidodendron_ and its allies, to which the spore-cases in question\r\nappear to belong, are evidently much less important to coal accumulation\r\nthan _Sigillaria_, which cannot be affirmed to have produced spore-cases\r\nsimilar to those in question, even though the observation of Goldenberg\r\nas to their fruit can be relied on; the accuracy of which, however, I am\r\ninclined to doubt.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, while giving due credit to those who have advocated\r\nthe spore-theory of coal, for directing attention to this curious and no\r\ndoubt important constituent of mineral fuel, and admitting that I may\r\npossibly have given too little attention to it, I must maintain that\r\nsporangite-beds are exceptional among coals, and that cortical and woody\r\nmatters are the most abundant ingredients in all the ordinary kinds; and\r\nto this I cannot think that the coals of England constitute an exception.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, in conclusion, that the spore-cases of plants,\r\nin their indestructibility and richly carbonaceous character, only\r\npartake of qualities common to most suberous and epidermal matters, as I\r\nhave explained in the publications already referred to. Such epidermal\r\nand cortical substances are extremely rich in carbon and hydrogen,\r\nin this resembling bituminous coal. They are also very little liable\r\nto decay, and they resist more than other vegetable matters aqueous\r\ninfiltration--properties which have caused them to remain unchanged,\r\nand to continue free from mineral additions more than other vegetable\r\ntissues. These qualities are well seen in the bark of our American white\r\nbirch. It is no wonder that materials of this kind should constitute\r\nconsiderable portions of such vegetable accumulations as the beds of\r\ncoal, and that when present in large proportion they should afford richly\r\nbituminous beds. All this agrees with the fact, apparent on examination\r\nof the common coal, that the greater number of its purest layers consist\r\nof the flattened bark of _Sigillariæ_ and similar trees, just as any\r\nsingle flattened trunk embedded in shale becomes a layer of pure coal.\r\nIt also agrees with the fact that other layers of coal, and also the\r\ncannels and earthy bitumens, appear under the microscope to consist of\r\nfinely comminuted particles, principally of epidermal tissues, not only\r\nfrom the fruits and spore-cases of plants, but also from their leaves and\r\nstems. These considerations impress us, just as much as the abundance of\r\nspore-cases, with the immense amount of the vegetable matter which has\r\nperished during the accumulation of coal, in comparison with that which\r\nhas been preserved.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Dr. T. Sterry Hunt for the following very valuable\r\ninformation, which at once places in a clear and precise light the\r\nchemical relations of epidermal tissue and spores with coal. Dr. Hunt\r\nsays: \"The outer bark of the cork-tree, and the cuticle of many if not\r\nall other plants, consists of a highly carbonaceous matter, to which\r\nthe name of _suberin_ has been given. The spores of _Lycopodium_ also\r\napproach to this substance in composition, as will be seen by the\r\nfollowing, one of two analyses by Duconi,[CJ] along with which I give\r\nthe theoretical composition of pure cellulose or woody fibre, according\r\nto Payen and Mitscherlich, and an analysis of the suberin of cork, from\r\n_Quercus suber_, from which the ash and 2·5 per cent of cellulose have\r\nbeen deducted.[CK]\r\n\r\n[CJ] Liebig and Kopp, \"Jahresbuch,\" 1847-'48.\r\n\r\n[CK] Gmelin, \"Handbook,\" xv., 145.\r\n\r\n  ---------+-----------+--------+------------\r\n           | Cellulose.|  Cork. | Lycopodium.\r\n  ---------+-----------+--------+------------\r\n  Carbon   |  44·44    |  65·73 |   64·80\r\n  Hydrogen |   6·17    |   8·33 |    8·73\r\n  Nitrogen |   ....    |   1·50 |    6·18\r\n  Oxygen   |  49·39    |  24·44 |   20·29\r\n           +-----------+--------+------------\r\n    Total  | 100·00    | 100·00 |  100·00\r\n  ---------+-----------+--------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This difference is not less striking when we reduce the above centesimal\r\nanalyses to correspond with the formula of cellulose, C{24}H{20}O{20},\r\nand represent cork and _Lycopodium_ as containing twenty-four equivalents\r\nof carbon. For comparison I give the composition of specimens of peat,\r\nbrown coal, lignite, and bituminous coal:[CL]\r\n\r\n[CL] \"Canadian Naturalist,\" vi., 253.\r\n\r\nCellulose C{24}H{20}O{20}\r\n\r\nCork C{24}H{18-2/10}O{6-7/10}\r\n\r\nLycopodium C{24}H{19-4/10}NO{5-6/10}\r\n\r\nPeat (Vaux) C{24}H{14-4/10}O{10}\r\n\r\nBrown coal (Schröther) C{24}H{14-3/10}O{10-6/10}\r\n\r\nLignite (Vaux) C{24}H{11-3/10}O{6-4/10}\r\n\r\nBituminous coal (Regnault) C{24}H{10}O{3-3/10}\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen from this comparison that, in ultimate composition, cork\r\nand _Lycopodium_ are nearer to lignite than to woody fibre, and may be\r\nconverted into coal with far less loss of carbon and hydrogen than the\r\nlatter. They in fact approach closer in composition to resins and fats\r\nthan to wood, and, moreover, like those substances repel water, with\r\nwhich they are not easily moistened, and thus are able to resist those\r\natmospheric influences which effect the decay of woody tissue.\"\r\n\r\nI would add to this only one further consideration. The nitrogen\r\npresent in the _Lycopodium_ spores, no doubt, belongs to the protoplasm\r\ncontained in them, a substance which would soon perish by decay; and\r\nsubtracting this, the cell-walls of the spores and the walls of the\r\nspore-cases would be most suitable material for the production of\r\nbituminous coal. But this suitableness they share with the epidermal\r\ntissue of the scales of strobiles, and of the stems and leaves of ferns\r\nand lycopods, and, above all, with the thick, corky envelope of the\r\nstems of _Sigillariæ_ and similar trees, which, as I have elsewhere\r\nshown,[CM] from its condition in the prostrate and erect trunks contained\r\nin the beds associated with coal, must have been highly carbonaceous\r\nand extremely enduring and impermeable to water. In short, if, instead\r\nof \"spore-cases,\" we read \"epidermal tissues in general, including\r\nspore-cases,\" all that has been affirmed regarding the latter will\r\nbe strictly and literally true, and in accordance with the chemical\r\ncomposition, microscopical characters, and mode of occurrence of coal. It\r\nwill also be in accordance with the following statement, from my paper on\r\nthe \"Structures in Coal,\" published in 1859:\r\n\r\n[CM] \"Vegetable Structures in Coal,\" \"Journal of Geological Society,\"\r\nxv., 626. \"Conditions of Accumulation of Coal,\" _ibid._, xxii., 95.\r\n\"Acadian Geology,\" 197, 464.\r\n\r\n\"A single trunk of _Sigillaria_ in an erect forest presents an epitome of\r\na coal-seam. Its roots represent the _Stigmaria_ under-clay; its bark the\r\ncompact coal; its woody axis the mineral charcoal; its fallen leaves (and\r\nfruits), with remains of herbaceous plants growing in its shade, mixed\r\nwith a little earthy matter, the layers of coarse coal. The condition of\r\nthe durable outer bark of erect trees concurs with the chemical theory\r\nof coal, in showing the especial suitableness of this kind of tissue for\r\nthe production of the purer compact coals. It is also probable that the\r\ncomparative impermeability of the bark to mineral infiltration is of\r\nimportance in this respect, enabling this material to remain unaffected\r\nby causes which have filled those layers, consisting of herbaceous\r\nmaterials and decayed wood, with pyrites and other mineral substances.\"\r\n\r\nWe need not go far in search of the uses of the coal vegetation, when .we\r\nconsider the fact that the greatest civilised nations are dependent on\r\nit for their fuel. Without the coal of the Carboniferous period and the\r\niron-ore which is one of the secondary consequences of coal accumulation,\r\njust as bog-ores of iron occur in the subsoils of modern peats, it would\r\nhave been impossible either to sustain great nations in comfort in the\r\ncolder climates of the northern hemisphere or to carry on our arts and\r\nmanufactures. The coal-formation yields to Great Britain alone about one\r\nhundred and sixty million tons of coal annually, and the miners of the\r\nUnited States extract mainly from the same formation nearly a hundred\r\nmillion tons, while the British colonies and dependencies produce about\r\nfive million tons; and it is a remarkable fact that it is to the English\r\nrace that the greatest supply of this buried power and heat and light has\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\nThe great forests of the coal period, while purifying the atmosphere of\r\nits excess of unwholesome carbonic acid, were storing up the light and\r\nheat of Palæozoic summers in a form in which they could be recovered in\r\nour human age, so that, independently of their uses to the animals which\r\nwere their contemporaries, they are indispensable to the existence of\r\ncivilised man.\r\n\r\nNor can we hope soon to be able to dispense with the services of\r\nthis accumulated store of fuel. The forests of to-day are altogether\r\ninsufficient for the supply of our wants, and though we are beginning\r\nto apply water-power to the production of electricity, and though some\r\npromising plans have been devised for the utilisation of the direct heat\r\nand light of the sun, we are still quite as dependent as any of our\r\npredecessors on what has been done for us in the Palæozoic age.\r\n\r\nIn the previous pages I have said little respecting the physical\r\ngeography of the Carboniferous age; but, as may be inferred from the\r\nvegetation, this in the northern hemisphere presented a greater expanse\r\nof swampy flats little elevated above the sea than we find in any other\r\nperiod. As to the southern hemisphere, less is known, but the conditions\r\nof vegetation would seem to have been essentially the same.\r\n\r\nTaking the southern hemisphere as a whole, I have not seen any evidence\r\nof a Lower Devonian or Upper Silurian flora; but in South Africa and\r\nAustralia there are remains of Upper Devonian or Lower Carboniferous\r\nplants. These were succeeded by a remarkable Upper Carboniferous or\r\nPermian group, which spread itself all over India, Australia, and South\r\nAfrica,[CN] and contains some forms (_Vertebraria_, _Phyllotheca_,\r\n_Glossopteris_, &c. ) not found in rocks of similar age in the northern\r\nhemisphere, so that, if the age of these beds has been correctly\r\ndetermined, the southern hemisphere was in advance in relation to some\r\ngenera of plants. This, however, is to be expected when we consider that\r\nthe Triassic and Jurassic flora of the north contains or consists of\r\nintruders from more southern sites. These beds are succeeded in India by\r\nothers holding cycads, &c., of Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous types\r\n(Rajmahal and Jabalpur groups).\r\n\r\n[CN] Wyley, \"Journal Geol. Society,\" vol. xxiii., p. 172; Daintree,\r\n_ibid._, vol. xxviii.; also Clarke and McCoy.\r\n\r\nBlanford has shown that there is a very great similarity in this series\r\nall over the Australian and Indian region.[CO] Hartt and Darby have in\r\nlike manner distinguished Devonian and Carboniferous forms in Brazil\r\nakin to those of the northern hemisphere. Thus the southern hemisphere\r\nwould seem to have kept pace with the northern, and according to Blanford\r\nthere is evidence there of cold conditions in the Permian, separating\r\nthe Palæozoic flora from that of the Mesozoic, in the same manner that\r\nRamsay has supposed a similar period of cold to have done north of the\r\nequator. This would imply a very great change of climate, since we have\r\nevidence of the extension of the Lower Carboniferous flora at least as\r\nfar north as Spitzbergen. The upper coal-formation we cannot, however,\r\ntrace nearly so far north; so that a gradual refrigeration may have been\r\ngoing on before the Permian. Thus in both hemispheres there was a general\r\nsimilarity in the later Palæozoic flora, and perhaps similar conditions\r\nleading to its extinction and to its replacement by that to be described\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[CO] \"Journal Geol.

W. Dawson.\r\n\r\nAll of the above can be vouched for as good species based upon\r\nmicroscopic examination of a very large number of trunks from different\r\nparts of North America. The three Erian species of _Dadoxylon_ and _D.\r\nantiquius_ from the Lower Carboniferous have two or more rows of cells\r\nin the medullary rays. The last named has several rows, and is a true\r\n_Palæoxylon_ allied to _D. Withami_ of Great Britain. _D. materiarium_\r\nis specially characteristic of the upper coal-formation and Permian,\r\nand to it must belong one or both of the species of foliage indicated\r\nabove. _D. Clarkii_ has very short, simple medullary rays of only a few\r\ncells superimposed, and has an inner cylinder of scalariform vessels,\r\napproaching in these points to _Cordaites_. _Ormoxylon_ has a very\r\npeculiar articulated pith and simple medullary rays.\r\n\r\nWitham in 1833 described several Carboniferous species of pine-wood,\r\nunder the generic name Pinites, separating under the name _Pitus_ species\r\nwhich appeared to have the discs on the cell-walls separate and in\r\ntransverse lines. Witham's name was changed by Goeppert to _Araucarites_,\r\nto indicate the similarity of these woods to Araucaria, _Pinites_ being\r\nreserved for trees more closely allied to the ordinary pines. Endlicher,\r\nrestricting Araucarites to foliage, etc., of Araucaria-like trees, gave\r\nthe name _Dadoxylon_ to the wood; and this, through Unger's \"Genera and\r\nSpecies,\" has gained somewhat general acceptance. Endlicher also gave the\r\nname _Pissadendron_ to the species which Witham had called _Pitus_; but\r\nBrongniart proposed the name _Palæoxylon_ to include all the species with\r\nthick and complex medullary rays, whatever the arrangement of the discs.\r\nIn Schimper's new work Kraus substitutes _Araucarioxylon_ for Endlicher's\r\n_Dadoxylon_, and includes under _Pissadendron_ all the species placed by\r\nBrongniart in _Palæoxylon_.\r\n\r\nTo understand all this confusion, it may be observed that the characters\r\navailable in the determination of Palæozoic coniferous wood are chiefly\r\nthe form and arrangement of the wood-cells, the character of the bordered\r\npores or discs of their walls, and the form and composition of the\r\nmedullary rays.\r\n\r\nThe character on which Witham separated his genus _Pitus_ from _Pinites_\r\nis, as I have ascertained by examination of slices of one of his original\r\nspecimens kindly presented to me by Mr. Sanderson, of Edinburgh,\r\ndependent on state of preservation, the imperfectly preserved discs\r\nor areolations of the walls of the fibre presenting the appearance of\r\nseparate and distinct circles, while in other parts of the same specimens\r\nthese discs are seen to be contiguous and to assume hexagonal forms, so\r\nthat in this respect they do not really differ from the ordinary species\r\nof _Dadoxylon_. The true character for subdividing those species which\r\nare especially characteristic of the Carboniferous, is the composite\r\nstructure of the medullary rays, which are thick and composed of several\r\nradial piles of cells placed side by side. This was the character\r\nemployed by Brongniart in separating the genus _Palæoxylon_, though he\r\nmight with convenience have retained Witham's name, merely transferring\r\nto the genus the species of Witham's _Pinites_ which have complex\r\nmedullary rays. The Erian rocks present the greatest variety of types,\r\nand _Palæoxylon_ is especially characteristic of the Lower Carboniferous,\r\nwhile species of _Dadoxylon_ with two rows of bordered pores and simple\r\nmedullary rays are especially plentiful in the upper coal-formation and\r\nPermo-Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nThe following table will clearly show the distinctive characters and\r\nrelations of the genera in question, as held by the several authors above\r\nreferred to:\r\n\r\n_Wood of Palæozoic Conifers._\r\n\r\n      Woody    |  Medullary rays    |       Generic       |   Geological\r\n      fibres.  |    and pith.       |        names.       |      age.\r\n  -------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------\r\n  No discs.    | One or two series  | _Aporoxylon_,       | Devonian\r\n               |  of cells.         |   Unger.            |  (Erian).\r\n  -------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------\r\n               | Complex, or of two | { _Pitus_,          |\r\n               |  or more series of | {  Witham.          | Middle and\r\n               |  or more series of | { _Palæoxylon_,     |  Lower\r\n               |  cells.            | {   Brongniart.     |  Carboniferous\r\n               | Pith Sternbergian. | { _Pissadendron_,   |  and Devonian.\r\n               |                    | {   Endlicher.      |\r\n               +--------------------+---------------------+---------------\r\n  Discs in one | Simple, or of one  | { _Araucarites_,    |\r\n   series      |  row of cells.     | {  Goeppert         | Upper\r\n   contiguous, | Pith Sternbergian. | { _Dadoxylon_,      |  Carboniferous\r\n   or in       |                    | {   Endlicher.      |  and Permian.\r\n   several     |                    | { _Araucarioxylon_, |\r\n   series      |                    | {   Schimper.       |\r\n   spirally    +--------------------+---------------------+---------------\r\n   arranged.   | Pith in spherical  | _Ormoxylon_,[CQ] Dn. | Devonian.\r\n               |  chambers.         |                     |\r\n               +--------------------+---------------------+---------------\r\n               | Medullary sheath   |                     | Devonian.\r\n               |  scalariform.      | _Dadoxylon_         |\r\n               | Medullary rays     |   (Cordæoxylon),[CR] |\r\n               |  frequent, simple, |   Dn.               |\r\n               |  short.            |                     |\r\n  -------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------\r\n\r\n[CQ] Type _O.

This may\r\nbe wood of Cordaites, to which it approaches very closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Family_ Cordaites, _Genus_ Cordaites, Brongniart.\r\n\r\nTrunks marked by transverse scars of attachment of bases of leaves;\r\nleaves broad, with many parallel veins, and attached by a broad\r\nbase; pistillate and staminate catkins of the nature of Antholithes.\r\nFruit winged or pulpy, of the kind known as _Cardiocarpum_. Stem\r\nwith a Sternbergia pith, usually large, surrounded by a ring of\r\npseudo-scalariform vessels, and with a cylinder usually narrow, of woody\r\nwedges, with bordered pores in one or more series, and with simple\r\nmedullary rays.\r\n\r\nFrom specimens kindly presented to me by Prof. Renault, I have been\r\nable to ascertain that the stems of some at least of these plants\r\n(Eucordaites) are distinct in structure from all the species of\r\n_Dadoxylon_, above mentioned, except _D. Clarkii_, of the Erian. They may\r\nbe regarded as intermediate between those of conifers and cycads, which\r\nis indeed the probable position of these remarkable plants.\r\n\r\nGrand d'Eury has divided the _Cordaites_ into sub-genera, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Eucordaites._--Leaves spatulate, obovate, elliptical, or lanceolate,\r\nsessile, entire, with rounded apices and of leathery consistency. The\r\nleaves are from twenty to ninety centimetres in length. The nerves are\r\neither equally or unequally strong.\r\n\r\n2. _Dorycordaites._--Leaves lanceolate, with sharp points; nerves\r\nnumerous, fine, and equal in strength. The leaves attain a length of from\r\nforty to fifty centimetres.\r\n\r\n3. _Poacordaites._--Leaves narrow, linear, entire, blunt at the point,\r\nwith nerves nearly equally strong. The leaves are as much as forty\r\ncentimetres in length.\r\n\r\nTo these Renault and Zeiller have added a fourth group, _Scutocordaites_.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Sternbergia.\r\n\r\nThis is merely a provisional genus intended to receive casts of the pith\r\ncylinders of various fossil trees. Their special peculiarity is that,\r\nas in the modern _Cecropia peltata_, and some species of _Ficus_, the\r\npith consists of transverse dense partitions which, on the elongation\r\nof the internodes, become separated from each other, so as to produce a\r\nchambered pith cavity, the cast of which shows transverse furrows. The\r\nyoung twigs of the modern _Abies balsamifera_ present a similar structure\r\non a minute scale. I have ascertained and described such pith-cylinders\r\nin large stems of _Dadoxylon Ouangondianum_, and _D. materiarium_. They\r\noccur also in the stems of _Cordaites_ and probably of _Sigillariæ_. I\r\nhave discussed these curious fossils at length in \"Acadian Geology\" and\r\nin the \"Journal of the Geological Society of London,\" 1860. The following\r\nsummary is from the last-mentioned paper:\r\n\r\n_a._ As Prof. Williamson and the writer have shown, many of the\r\n_Sternbergia_ piths belong to coniferous trees of the genus _Dadoxylon_.\r\n\r\n_b._ A few specimens present multiporous tissue, of the type of\r\n_Dictyoxylon_, a plant of unknown affinities, and which, according to\r\nWilliamson, has a _Sternbergia_ pith.\r\n\r\n_c._ Other examples show a true scalariform tissue, comparable with that\r\nof _Lepidodendron_ or _Sigillaria_, but of finer texture. Corda has shown\r\nthat plants of the type of the former genus (his _Lomatophloios_) had\r\n_Sternbergia_ piths. Some plants of this group are by external characters\r\nloosely reckoned by botanists as ribless _Sigillariæ_ (_Clathraria_); but\r\nI believe that they are not related even ordinally to that genus.\r\n\r\n_d._ Many Carboniferous _Sternbergiæ_ show structures identical with\r\nthose described above as occurring in _Cordaites_, and also in some of\r\nthe trees ordinarily reckoned as _Sigillariæ_.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Cardiocarpum.\r\n\r\nI have found at least eight species of these fruits in the Erian and\r\nCarboniferous of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, all of which are\r\nevidently fruits of gymnospermous trees. They agree in having a dense\r\ncoaly nucleus of appreciable thickness, even in the flattened specimens,\r\nand surrounded by a thin and veinless wing or margin. They have thus\r\nprecisely the appearance of samaras of many existing forest-trees, some\r\nof which they also resemble in the outline of the margin, except that the\r\nwings of samaras are usually veiny. The character of the nucleus, and the\r\noccasional appearance in it of marks possibly representing cotyledons or\r\nembryos, forbids the supposition that they are spore-cases. They must\r\nhave been fruits of phænogams. Whether they were winged fruits or seeds,\r\nor fruits with a pulpy envelope like those of cycads and some conifers,\r\nmay be considered less certain. The not infrequent distortion of the\r\nmargin is an argument in favour of the latter view, though this may also\r\nbe supposed to have occurred in samaras partially decayed. On the other\r\nhand, their being always apparently flattened in one plane, and the\r\nnucleus being seldom, if ever, found denuded of its margin, are arguments\r\nin favour of their having been winged nutlets or seeds. Until recently I\r\nhad regarded the latter view as more probable, and so stated the matter\r\nin the second edition of \"Acadian Geology.\" I have, however, lately\r\narrived at the conclusion that the _Cardiocarpa_ of the type of _C.\r\ncornutum_ were gymnospermous seeds, having two cotyledons embedded in an\r\nalbumen and covered with a strong membranous or woody tegmen surrounded\r\nby a fleshy outer coat, and that the notch at the apex represents the\r\nforamen or micropyle of the ovule. The structure was indeed very similar\r\nto that of the seeds of _Taxus_ and of _Salisburia_. With respect to some\r\nof the other species, however, especially those with very broad margins,\r\nit still appears likely that they were winged.\r\n\r\nThe _Cardiocarpa_ were borne in racemes or groups, and it seems certain\r\nthat some of them at least are the seeds of _Cordaites_. The association\r\nof some of them and of those of the next genus with _Sigillariæ_ is so\r\nconstant that I cannot doubt that some of them belong to plants of that\r\ngenus, or possibly to taxine conifers. The great number of distinct\r\nspecies of these seeds, as compared with that of known trees which could\r\nhave produced them, is very remarkable.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Trigonocarpum.\r\n\r\nThese are large angled nuts contained in a thick envelope, and showing\r\ninternal structures resembling those of the seeds of modern _Taxineæ_.\r\nThere are numerous species, as well as allied seeds referred to the\r\nprovisional genera _Rhabdocarpus_ and _Carpolithes_. In _Trigonocarpum\r\nHookeri_ I have described the internal structure of one of those seeds,\r\nand many fine examples from the coal-field of St. Etienne, in France,\r\nhave been described by Brongniart, so that their internal structure is\r\nvery well known.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Antholithes.\r\n\r\nThis is also a provisional genus, to include spikes of floral organs,\r\nsome of which are known to have belonged to _Cordaites_, others probably\r\nto _Sigillariæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Uncertain Affinities.\r\n\r\n_Family_ Sigillariaceæ.\r\n\r\nUnder this name palæobotanists have included a great number of trees\r\nof the Carboniferous system, all of which are characterised by broad\r\nleaf-sears, with three vascular scars, and usually arranged in\r\nvertical rows, and by elongated three-nerved leaves, and roots of the\r\nstigmaria type--that is, with rounded pits, marking the attachment of\r\nrootlets spirally arranged. These trees, however, collected in the\r\ngenus Sigillaria by arbitrary characters, which pass into those of\r\nthe Lepidodendroid trees, have been involved in almost inextricable\r\nconfusion, to disentangle which it will be necessary to consider: 1. The\r\nexternal characters of _Sigillariæ_, and trees confounded with them. 2.\r\nSubdivision of _Sigillariæ_ by external markings. 3. The microscopic\r\ncharacter of their stems. 4. What is known of their foliage and fruit.\r\n\r\n1. _Characters of Sigillaroid and Lepidodendroid Trunks_.\r\n\r\nIt may be premised that the modes of determination in fossil botany\r\nare necessarily different from those employed in recent botany. The\r\npalæobotanist must have recourse to characters derived from the leaves,\r\nthe scars left by their fall, and the internal structures of the stem.\r\nThese parts, held in little esteem by botanists in describing modern\r\nplants, and much neglected by them, must hold the first place in the\r\nregard of the fossil botanist, whereas the fructification, seldom\r\npreserved, and generally obscure, is of comparatively little service. It\r\nis to be remarked also that in such generalised plants as those of the\r\nPalæozoic, remarkable rather for the development of the vegetative than\r\nof the reproductive organs, the former rise in importance as compared\r\nwith their value in the study of modern plants.\r\n\r\nIn _Sigillariæ_, _Lepidodendra_, &c., the following surfaces of the stem\r\nmay be presented to our inspection:\r\n\r\n1. The outer surface of the epidermis without its leaves, but with\r\nthe leaf-bases and leaf-scars more or less perfectly preserved. On\r\nthis surface we may recognise: (1) Cellular swellings or projections\r\nof the bark to which the leaves are attached. These may be called\r\nleaf-bases, and they are sometimes very prominent. (2) The actual mark\r\nof the attachment of the leaf situated in the most prominent part of\r\nthe leaf-base. This is the _leaf-scar_. (3) In the leaf-scar when well\r\npreserved we can see one or more minute punctures or prominences which\r\nare the points where the vascular bundles passing to the leaf found exit.\r\nThese are the vascular scars.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves are attached, the leaf-scars and vascular scars cannot\r\nbe seen, but the leaf-bases can be made out. Hence it is important, if\r\npossible, to secure specimens with and without the leaves. In flattened\r\nspecimens the leaf-bases are often distorted by pressure and marked with\r\nfurrows which must not be mistaken for true structural characters. The\r\nleaf-bases, which are in relief on the outer surface of the stem, of\r\ncourse appear as depressions on the mould in the containing rock, in\r\nwhich the markings often appear much more distinctly than on the plant\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n2. The outer surface of the epidermis may have been removed or may be\r\ndestroyed by the coarseness of the containing rock. In this case the\r\nleaf-bases are usually preserved on the surface of the outer or corky\r\nbark, but the leaf-scars and vascular scars have disappeared. This gives\r\nthat condition of Lepidodendroid trees to which the name _Knorria_ has\r\nbeen applied. When plants are in this state careful inspection may\r\nsometimes discover traces of the leaf-scars on portions of the stem, and\r\nthus enable the _Knorria_ to be connected with the species to which it\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\n3. The outer or corky bark may be removed, exposing the surface of the\r\ninner or fibrous and cellular bark, which in the plants in question is\r\nusually of great thickness. In this case neither the leaf-bases nor the\r\nscars are seen, but punctures or little furrows or ridges appear where\r\nthe vascular bundles entered the inner bark. Specimens in this state are\r\nusually said to be decorticated, though only the outer bark is removed.\r\nIt is often difficult to determine plants in this condition, unless some\r\nportion of the stem can be found still retaining the bark; but when care\r\nis taken in collecting, it will not infrequently be found that the true\r\nouter surface can be recovered from the containing rock, especially if\r\na coaly layer representing the outer bark intervenes between this and\r\nthe inner impression. Specimens of this kind, taken alone, have been\r\nreferred to the genera _Knorria_, _Bothrodendron_, and _Halonia_.\r\n\r\n4. In some cases, though not frequently, the outer surface of the\r\nligneous cylinder is preserved. It almost invariably presents a regularly\r\nstriated or irregularly wrinkled appearance, depending upon the vertical\r\nwoody wedges, or the positions of the medullary rays or vascular bundles.\r\nSpecimens of this kind constituted some of the _Endogenites_ of the\r\nolder botanists, and the genus _Schizodendron_ of Eichwald appears to\r\ninclude some of them. Many of them have also been incorrectly referred to\r\nCalamites.\r\n\r\n5. In some cases the cast of the medullary cylinder or pith may alone\r\nbe preserved. This may be nearly smooch or slightly marked by vertical\r\nstriæ, but more usually presents a transverse striation, and not\r\ninfrequently the transverse constrictions and septa characteristic of the\r\ngenus Sternbergia. Loose _Sternbergiæ_ afford little means of connecting\r\nthem with the species to which they belong, except by the microscopic\r\nexamination of the shreds of the ligneous cylinder which often cling to\r\nthem.[CS]\r\n\r\n[CS] See my paper, \"Journal of Geological Society,\" vol. xxvii.\r\n\r\nThese facts being premised, the following general statements may be made\r\nrespecting some of the more common Palæozoic genera, referring, however,\r\nprincipally to the perfect markings as seen on the epidermis:\r\n\r\n_Sigillaria._--Leaf-bases hexagonal or elongated, or confluent on a\r\nvertical ridge. Leaf-scars hexagonal or shield-shaped. Vascular scars\r\nthree, the two lateral larger than the central. This last character\r\nis constant, depending on the fact that the leaves of Sigillaria have\r\ntwo or more vascular bundles. All so-called _Sigillariæ_ having the\r\ncentral vascular scar largest, or only one vascular bundle, should be\r\nrejected from this genus. In young branches of branching _Sigillariæ_ the\r\nleaf-scars sometimes appear to be spiral, but in the older stems they\r\nform vertical rows; interrupted, however, by transverse rows or bands\r\nof _fruit-scars_, each with a single large central vascular scar, and\r\nwhich have borne the organs of fructification. _Arthrocaulis_ of McCoy is\r\nfounded on this peculiarity.\r\n\r\n_Syringodendron._--Differs from Sigillaria in the leaf-scars, which are\r\ncircular and with a single vascular bundle. It is a matter of doubt\r\nwhether these plants were of higher rank than Sigillaria tending toward\r\nthe pines, or of lower rank tending toward Cyclostigma. Their leaf-bases\r\nform vertical ridges.\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron._--Leaf-bases rhombic, oval, or lanceolate, moderately\r\nprominent. Leaf-scars rhombic or sometimes shield-shaped or heart-shaped,\r\nin the middle or upper part of the leaf-base. Vascular scars three--the\r\nmiddle one always largest and corresponding to the single nerve of the\r\nleaf; the lateral ones sometimes obsolete.\r\n\r\nIn older stems three modes of growth are observed. In some species\r\nthe expansion of the bark obliterates the leaf-bases and causes the\r\nleaf-scars to appear separated by wide spaces of more or less wrinkled\r\nbark, which at length becomes longitudinally furrowed and simulates the\r\nribbed character of Sigillaria. In others the leaf-bases grow in size\r\nas the trunk expands, so that even in large trunks they are contiguous\r\nthough much larger than those on the branches. In others the outer bark,\r\nhardening at an early age, is incapable of either of the above changes,\r\nand merely becomes cleft into deep furrows in the old trunks.\r\n\r\n_Lepidophloios._--Leaf-bases transverse and prominent--often very much\r\nso. Leaf-scars transversely rhombic or oval with three vascular scars,\r\nthe central largest. Leaves very long and one-nerved. Large strobiles\r\nor branchlets borne in two ranks or spirally on the sides of the stem,\r\nand leaving large, round scars (_cone-scars_), often with radiating\r\nimpressions of the basal row of scales.\r\n\r\nSpecies with long or drooping leaf-bases have been included in\r\n_Lepidophloios_ and _Lomatophloios_, Species with short leaf-bases and\r\ncone-scars in two rows have been called _Ulodendron_, and some of them\r\nhave been included in Sigillaria (sub-genus _Clathraria_). Decorticated\r\nstems are Bothrodendron and _Halonia_. Some of the species approach near\r\nto the last genus, especially to the Lepidodendra with rhombic leaf-bases\r\nlike _L. tetragonum_.\r\n\r\n_Cyclostigma._--Leaf-bases undeveloped. Leaf-scars circular or\r\nhorseshoe-shaped, small, with a central vascular scar. In old trunks of\r\nCyclostigma the leaf-scars become widely separated, and sometimes appear\r\nin vertical rows. Young branches of Lepidodendron sometimes have the\r\nleaf-scars similar to those of Cyclostigma.\r\n\r\n_Leptophleum._--Leaf-bases flat, rhombic; leaf-scars obsolete; vascular\r\nscar single, central. The last two genera are characteristically Devonian.\r\n\r\nIn contradistinction from the trees above mentioned, the following\r\ngeneral statements may be made respecting other groups:\r\n\r\nIn conifers the leaf-bases are usually elongated vertically, often scaly\r\nin appearance, and with the leaf-scar terminal and round, oval, or\r\nrhombic, and with a single well-marked vascular scar.\r\n\r\nIn Calamites, Calamodendron, and Asterophyllites the scars of the\r\nbranchlets or leaves are circular or oval, with only a single vascular\r\nscar, and situated in verticils at the top of well-marked nodes of the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\nIn tree-ferns the leaf-bases are large and usually without a distinct\r\narticulating surface. The vascular bundles are numerous. Protopteris\r\nhas rounded leaf-scars with a large horseshoe-shaped bundle of vessels\r\nabove and small bundles below. Caulopteris has large elliptic or oval\r\nleaf-scars with vascular scars disposed concentrically. Palæopteris,[CT]\r\nof Geinitz, has the leaf-scars transversely oval and the vascular bundles\r\nconfluent in a transverse band with an appendage or outlying bundle\r\nbelow. Stemmatopteris has leaf-scars similar to those of Caulopteris, but\r\nthe vascular bundles united into a horseshoe-shaped band.\r\n\r\n[CT] This name, preoccupied by Geinitz, has been inadvertently misapplied\r\nto the Devonian ferns of the genus _Archæopteris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Subdivision of Sigillariæ in Accordance with their Markings_.\r\n\r\nThe following groups may be defined in this way; but, being based on one\r\ncharacter only, they are of course in all probability far from natural:\r\n\r\n1. _Sigillaria_, Brongniart. Type, _Sigillaria reniformis_, Brongniart,\r\nor _S. Brounii_, Dawson.--Stem with broad ribs, usually much broader than\r\nthe usually oval or elliptical tripunctate areoles, but disappearing at\r\nbase, owing to expansion of the stem. Leaves narrow, long, three-nerved.\r\n\r\n2. _Rhytidolepis_, Sternberg. Type, _S. scutellata_, Brongniart.--Ribs\r\nnarrow, and often transversely striate. Areoles large, hexagonal or\r\nshield-shaped, tripunctate. Leaves as in last group. Kings of rounded\r\nscars on the stems and branches mark attachment of fruit. It is possible\r\nthat some of the smaller stems of this group may be branches of trees of\r\ngroup first.\r\n\r\n3. _Syringodendron_, Sternberg. Type, _S. organum_, L. and H., _S.\r\noculata_, Brongniart.--Stems ribbed; areoles small and round, and\r\napparently with a single scar, or three closely approximated. These are\r\nrare, and liable to be confounded with decorticated examples of other\r\ngroups; but I have some specimens which unquestionably represent the\r\nexternal surface.\r\n\r\n4. _Favularia_, Sternberg. Type, _Sigillaria elegans_ of\r\nBrongniart.--Leaf-bases hexagonal, or in young branches elliptical, in\r\nvertical rows, but without distinct ribs, except in old or decorticated\r\nstems. Fruit borne in verticils on the branches bearing transverse rows\r\nof rounded scars. Leaves somewhat broad and longitudinally striate.\r\n\r\n5. _Leioderma_, Goldenberg. Type, _S. Sydnensis_, Dawson.--Ribs obsolete.\r\nCortical and ligneous surfaces striate. Vascular scars double, elongate\r\nlongitudinally, and alike on cortical and inner surfaces. Areoles in rows\r\nand distinct; stigmaria-roots striate, with small and distinct areoles.\r\n\r\n6. _Clathraria_, Brongniart. Type, _S. Menardi_, Brongniart.--Areoles\r\nhexagonal, not in distinct rows, but having a spiral appearance. Some\r\nof the plants usually referred to this group are probably branches of\r\n_Favularia_. Others are evidently fragments of plants of the genus\r\n_Lepidophloios_.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Internal Structures of Sigillaria-Stems_.\r\n\r\nI long ago pointed out, on the evidence of the external markings and\r\nmode of growth, that the stems of _Sigillariæ_ must have been exogenous,\r\nand this conclusion has now been fully confirmed by the microscopic\r\nresearches of Williamson, not only in the case of _Sigillariæ_, but\r\nof _Lepidodendra_ and _Calamodendra_ as well. Confining myself to my\r\nown observations, three types of _Sigillariæ_ are known to me by their\r\ninternal structures, though I cannot certainly correlate all of these\r\nwith the external markings referred to above.\r\n\r\n1. _Diploxylon_, in which the stem consists of a small internal axis\r\nsurrounded by a very thick inner bark and a dense outer cortex. A fine\r\nexample from the South Joggins is thus described:[CU]\r\n\r\n[CU] \"Journal of the Geological Society of London,\" November, 1877.\r\n\r\n\"The axis of the stem is about six centimetres in its greatest diameter,\r\nand consists of a central pith-cylinder and two concentric coats of\r\nscalariform tissue. The pith-cylinder is replaced by sandstone, and is\r\nabout one centimetre in diameter. The inner cylinder of scalariform\r\ntissue is perfectly continuous, not radiated, and about one millimetre\r\nin thickness. Its vessels are somewhat crushed, but have been of large\r\ndiameter. Its outer surface, which readily separates from that of the\r\nouter cylinder, is striated longitudinally. The outer cylinder, which\r\nconstitutes by much the largest part of the whole, is also composed of\r\nscalariform tissue; but this is radially arranged, with the individual\r\ncells quadrangular in cross-section. The cross-bars are similar on all\r\nthe sides and usually simple and straight, but sometimes branching or\r\nslightly reticulated. The wall intervening between the bars has extremely\r\ndelicate longitudinal waving lines of ligneous lining, in the manner\r\nfirst described by Williamson as occurring in the scalariform tissue\r\nof certain _Lepidodendra_. A few small radiating spaces, partially\r\noccupied with pyrites, obscurely represent the medullary rays, which must\r\nhave been very feebly developed. The radiating bundles passing to the\r\nleaves run nearly horizontally; but their structure is very imperfectly\r\npreserved. The stem being old and probably long deprived of its leaves,\r\nthey may have been partially disorganised before it was fossilised. The\r\nouter surface of the axis is striated longitudinally, and in some places\r\nmarked with impressions of tortuous fibres, apparently those of the inner\r\nbark. In the cross-section, where weathered, it shows concentric rings;\r\nbut under the microscope these appear rather as bands of compressed\r\ntissue than as proper lines of growth. They are about twenty in number.\r\nThis tree has an erect, ribbed trunk, twelve feet in height and fifteen\r\ninches in diameter, swelling to about two feet at the base.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Favularia Type._--This has been well described by Brongniart and\r\nby Renault,[CV] and differs from the above chiefly in the fact that\r\nthe outer exogenous woody zone is composed of reticulated instead of\r\nscalariform tissue, and the inner zone is of the peculiar form which I\r\nhave characterised as pseudo-scalariform.\r\n\r\n[CV] \"Botanique Fossile,\" Paris, 1881.\r\n\r\n3. _Sigillaria Proper._--This I have illustrated in my paper in the\r\n\"Journal of the Geological Society\" for May, 1871, and it appears\r\nto represent the highest and most perfect type of the larger ribbed\r\n_Sigillaria_. This structure I have described as follows, basing my\r\ndescription on a very fine axis found in an erect stem, and on the\r\nfragments of the woody axis found in the bases of other erect stems:\r\n\r\n_a._ A dense cellular outer bark, usually in the state of compact\r\ncoal--but when its structure is preserved, showing a tissue of thickened\r\nparenchymatous cells.\r\n\r\n_b._ A very thick inner bark, which has usually in great part perished,\r\nor been converted into coal, but which, in old trunks, contained a large\r\nquantity of prosenchymatous tissue, very tough and of great durability.\r\nThis \"bast-tissue\" is comparable with that of the inner bark of modern\r\nconifers, and constitutes much of the mineral charcoal of the coal-seams.\r\n\r\n_c._ An outer ligneous cylinder, composed of wood-cells, either with\r\na single row of large bordered pores,[CW] in the manner of pines\r\nand cycads, or with two, three, or four rows of such pores sometimes\r\ninscribed in hexagonal areoles in the manner of Dadoxylon. This woody\r\ncylinder is traversed by medullary rays, which are short, and composed\r\nof few rows of cells superimposed. It is also traversed by oblique\r\nradiating bundles of pseudo-scalariform tissue proceeding to the leaves.\r\nIn some _Sigillariæ_ this outer cylinder was itself in part composed of\r\npseudo-scalariform tissue, as in Brongniart's specimen of _S. elegans_;\r\nand in others its place may have been taken by multiporous tissue, as in\r\na case above referred to; but I have no reason to believe that either of\r\nthese variations occurred in the typical ribbed species now in question.\r\nThe woody fibres of the outer cylinder may be distinguished most readily\r\nfrom those of conifers, as already mentioned, by the thinness of their\r\nwalls, and the more irregular distribution of the pores. Additional\r\ncharacters are furnished by the medullary rays and the radiating bundles\r\nof scalariform tissue when these can be observed.\r\n\r\n[CW] These are the same with the wood-cells elsewhere called discigerous\r\ntissue, and to which I have applied the terms uniporous and multiporous.\r\nThe markings on the walls are caused by an unlined portion of the\r\ncell-wall placed in a disk or depression, and this often surrounded by an\r\nhexagonal rim of thickened wall; but in all cases these structures are\r\nless pronounced than in _Dadoxylon_, and less regular in the walls of the\r\nsame cell, as well as in different layers of the tissues of the axis.\r\n\r\n_d._ An inner cylinder of pseudo-scalariform tissue. I have adopted the\r\nterm pseudo-scalariform for this tissue, from the conviction that it is\r\nnot homologous with the scalariform ducts of ferns and other acrogens,\r\nbut that it is merely a modification of the discigerous wood-cells, with\r\npores elongated transversely, and sometimes separated by thickened bars,\r\ncorresponding to the hexagonal areolation of the ordinary wood-cells.\r\nA similar tissue exists in cycads, and is a substitute for the spiral\r\nvessels existing in ordinary exogens.\r\n\r\n_e._ A large medulla, or pith, consisting of a hollow cylinder of\r\ncellular tissue, from which proceed numerous thin diaphragms towards the\r\ncentre of the stem.\r\n\r\nThese structures of the highest type of _Sigillaria_ are on the one\r\nhand scarcely advanced beyond those of Calamopitus, as described by\r\nWilliamson, and on the other approach to those of _Cordaites_, as seen in\r\nspecimens presented to me by Renault.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to the fruit of _Sigillariæ_, I have no new facts to offer.\r\nThe strobiles or spikes associated with these trees have been variously\r\ndescribed as gymnospermous (Renault) or cryptogamous (Groldenberg and\r\nWilliamson). 1 have never seen them in place. Two considerations,\r\nhowever, have always weighed with me in reference to this subject. One\r\nis the constant abundance of Trigonocarpa and Cardiocarpa in the soil\r\nof the Sigiliaria forests, as I have studied this at the South Joggins.\r\nThe other is that the rings of fruit-scars on the branches of Sigiliaria\r\nare homologous with leaf-scars, not with branches, and therefore should\r\nhave borne single carpels and not cones or spikes of inflorescence. These\r\nare merely suggestions, but I have no doubt they will be vindicated\r\nby future discoveries, which will, I have no doubt, show that in the\r\nfamily _Sigillariaceæ_ we have really two families, one possibly of\r\ngymnospermous rank, or at least approaching to this, the other allied to\r\nthe Lepidodendra.\r\n\r\n\r\nCryptogamia.\r\n\r\n(_Acrogenes._)\r\n\r\n_Family_ Lepidodendreæ; _Genus_ Lepidodendron, Sternberg.\r\n\r\nThese are arboreal Lycopods having linear one-nerved leaves, stems\r\nbranching dichotomously, and with ovate or rhombic leaf-bases bearing\r\nrhombic leaf-scars, often very prominent. The fruit is in scaly\r\nstrobiles, terminal or lateral, and there are usually, if not always,\r\nmacrospores and microspores in each strobile. The young branches and\r\nstems have a central pith, a cylinder of scalariform tubes sending out\r\nascending bundles to the leaves through a thick cellular and fibrous\r\ninner bark, and externally a dense cortex confluent with or consisting of\r\nthe leaf-bases. Older stems have a second or outer layer of scalariform\r\nfibres in wedges with medullary rays, and strengthening the stem by a\r\ntrue exogenous growth, much as in the Diploxylon type of Sigiliaria. The\r\ndevelopment of this exogenous cylinder is different in amount and rate\r\nin different species.[CX] This different development of the exogenous\r\naxis is accompanied with appropriate external appearances in the stems,\r\nand the changes which take place in their markings. These are of three\r\nkinds. In some species the areoles, at first close together, become, in\r\nthe process of the expansion of the stem, separated by intervening spaces\r\nof bark in a perfectly regular manner; so that in old stems, while widely\r\nseparated, they still retain their arrangement, while in young stems they\r\nare quite close to one another. This is the case in _L. corrugatum_. In\r\nother species the leaf-scars or bases increase in size in the old stems,\r\nstill retaining their forms and their contiguity to each other. This\r\nis the case in _L. undulatum_, and generally in those _Lepidodendra_\r\nwhich have large leaf-bases. In these species the continued vitality\r\nof the bark is shown by the occasional production of lateral strobiles\r\non large branches, in the manner of the modern red pine of America. In\r\nother species the areoles neither increase in size nor become regularly\r\nseparated by growth of the intervening bark; but in old stems the bark\r\nsplits into deep furrows, between which may be seen portions of bark\r\nstill retaining the areoles in their original dimensions and arrangement.\r\nThis is the case with _L. Pictoense_. This cracking of the bark no doubt\r\noccurs in very old trunks of the first two types, but not at all to the\r\nsame extent.\r\n\r\n[CX] See \"Memoirs of Dr. Williamson,\" in \"Philosophical Transactions,\"\r\nfor ample details.\r\n\r\nAs a type of Lepidodendron, I may describe one of the oldest\r\nCarboniferous species characteristic of the Lower Carboniferous in\r\nAmerica, and corresponding to _L. Veltheimianum_ of Europe.\r\n\r\nLepidodendron Corrugatum, Dawson.--(See Fig. 43, _supra_.) \"Quarterly\r\nJournal of Geological Society,\" vol. xv.; \"Acadian Geology,\" page 451.\r\n\r\n_Habit of Growth._--Somewhat slender, with long branches and long,\r\nslender leaves having a tendency to become horizontal or drooping.\r\n\r\n_Markings of Stem._--Leaf-bases disposed in quincunx or spirally,\r\nelongate, ovate, acute at both ends, but more acute and slightly\r\noblique at the lower end; most prominent in the upper third, and with\r\na slight vertical ridge. Leaf-scars small, rounded, and showing only\r\na single punctiform vascular scar. The leaf-scar on the outer surface\r\nis in the upper third of the base; but the obliquity of the vascular\r\nbundle causes it to be nearly central on the inside of the epidermis.\r\nIn young succulent shoots the leaf-scars are contiguous and round as\r\nin Cyclostigma, without distinct leaf-bases. In this state it closely\r\nresembles _L. Olivieri_, Eichwald.[CY]\r\n\r\n[CY] Lethæa Rossica, Plate Y, Figs. 12, 13.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary young branches the leaf-scars are contiguous, and closely\r\nresemble those of _L. elegans_, Brongt. (Fig. 43 C). As the branches\r\nincrease in diameter the leaf-scars slightly enlarge and sometimes assume\r\na verticillate appearance (Fig. 43 D). As they still further enlarge they\r\nbecome separated by gradually increasing spaces of bark, marked with many\r\nwaving striæ or wrinkles (Fig. 43 I, N). At the base of old stems the\r\nbark assumes a generally wrinkled appearance without distinct scars.\r\n\r\n_Knorria or Decorticated States._--Of these there is a great variety,\r\ndepending on the state of preservation, and the particular longitudinal\r\nridges. Fig. 43 D shows a form in which the vascular bundles appear\r\nas cylindrical truncate projections. Other forms show the leaf-bases\r\nprominent, or have an appearance of longitudinal ribbing produced by the\r\nexpansion of the bark.\r\n\r\n_Structure of Stem._--This is not perfectly preserved in any of my\r\nspecimens, but one flattened specimen shows a central medulla with a\r\nnarrow ring of scalariform vessels surrounding it, and constituting the\r\nwoody axis. The structure is thus similar to that of _L. Harcourtii_,\r\nwhich I regard as probably the same with the closely allied European\r\nspecies L. Veltheimianum.\r\n\r\n_Leaves._--These are narrow, one-nerved, curving somewhat rapidly outward\r\n(Figs. 43, B, C, D). They vary from one to two inches in length.\r\n\r\n_Roots._--I have not seen these actually attached, but they occur very\r\nabundantly in the under-clays of some erect forests of these plants at\r\nHorton Bluff, and are of the character of Stigmariæ (Figs. 30, 31). In\r\nsome of the under-clays the long, flattened rootlets are excessively\r\nabundant, and show the mark of a central vascular bundle.\r\n\r\n_Fructification._--Cones terminal, short, with many small, acute\r\nimbricate scales. Spore-cases globular, smooth (Fig. 43 C). On the\r\nsurface of some shales and sandstones at Horton there are innumerable\r\nround spore-cases of this tree about the size of mustard-seed (Fig. 43\r\nF). Large slabs are sometimes covered with these, and thin layers of\r\nshale are filled with flattened specimens.\r\n\r\nThis is the characteristic species of the Lower Carboniferous\r\ncoal-measures, occurring in great profusion at Horton Bluff and its\r\nvicinity, also at Sneid's Mills near Windsor, Noel and Five-Mile River,\r\nat Norton Creek and elsewhere in New Brunswick (Matthew's collection),\r\nand at Antigonish (Honeyman's collection).\r\n\r\nI have received from the lowest Carboniferous beds of Ohio specimens\r\nof this species.[CZ] According to Rogers and Lesquereux similar forms\r\noccur in the Vespertine of Pennsylvania and in the Lower Carboniferous\r\nof Illinois. _L. Veltheimianum_ of western Europe and _L. glincanum_ of\r\nRussia are closely allied Lower Carboniferous species.[DA]\r\n\r\n[CZ] \"Journal of Geological Society,\" November, 1862, p. 313.\r\n\r\n[DA] For comparisons of these see \"Report on Plants of Lower\r\nCarboniferous of Canada,\" p. 21.\r\n\r\nA very different type is furnished by a new species from the middle\r\ncoal-formation of Clifton, New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nLepidodendron Cliftonense, Dawson.--Habit of Growth.--Robust, with thick\r\nbranches, and leaves several inches in length. Terminal branches becoming\r\nslender, with shorter leaves.\r\n\r\n_Markings of Stem._--Leaf-bases long oval, pointed at ends, enlarging\r\nwith growth of stem. Leaf-scars central, rhombic, transverse.\r\n\r\n_Leaves._--One-nerved, acutely pointed, from four inches in length on the\r\nlarger branches to one inch or less on the branchlets.\r\n\r\n_Fructification._--Cones large, cylindrical or long oval, with large\r\nscales of trigonal form, and not elongated but lying close to the\r\nsurface. Borne on lateral, slender branchlets, with short leaves.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Lepidophloios, Sternberg; Ulodendron, L. and H.; Lomatophloios,\r\nCorda.\r\n\r\n_Lepidophloios._--Under this generic name, established by Sternberg,\r\nI include those lycopodiaceous trees of the coal-measures which have\r\nthick branches, transversely elongated leaf-scars, each with three\r\nvascular points and placed on elevated or scale-like protuberances,\r\nlong one-nerved leaves, and large lateral strobiles in vertical rows or\r\nspirally disposed. Their structure resembles that of _Lepidodendron_,\r\nconsisting of a _Sternbergia_ pith, a slender axis of large scalariform\r\nvessels, giving off from its surface bundles of smaller vessels to the\r\nleaves, a very thick cellular bark, and a thin dense outer bark, having\r\nsome elongated cells or bast-tissue on its inner side. In these trees the\r\nexogenous outer cylinder is less developed than in the Lepidodendra, and\r\nis sometimes wanting in stems or branches of some thickness.\r\n\r\nRegarding _L. laricinum_ of Sternberg as the type of the genus, and\r\ntaking in connection with this the species described by Goldenberg,\r\nand my own observations on numerous specimens found in Nova Scotia, 1\r\nhave no doubt that _Lomatophloios crassicaulis_ of Corda, and other\r\nspecies of that genus described by Goldenberg, _Ulodendron_ and\r\n_Bothrodendron_ of Lindley, _Lepidodendron ornatissimum_ of Brongniart,\r\nand _Halonia punctata_ of Geinitz, all belong to this genus, and differ\r\nfrom each other only in conditions of growth and preservation. Several\r\nof the species of _Lepidostrobus_ and _Lepidophyllum_ also belong to\r\n_Lepidophloios_.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Lepidophloios_ are readily distinguished from\r\n_Lepidodendron_ by the form of the areoles, and by the round scars on the\r\nstem, which usually mark the insertion of the large strobiles, though\r\nin barren stems they may also have produced branches; still, the fact\r\nof my finding the strobiles _in situ_ in one instance, the accurate\r\nresemblance which the scars bear to those left by the cones of the red\r\npine when borne on thick branches, and the actual impressions of the\r\nradiating scales in some specimens, leave no doubt in my mind that\r\nthey are usually the marks of cones; and the great size of the cones of\r\n_Lepidophloios_ accords with this conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe species of _Lepidophloios_ are numerous, and individuals are quite\r\nabundant in the coal formation, especially toward its upper part. Their\r\nflattened bark is frequent in the coal-beds and their roofs, affording\r\na thin layer of pure coal, which sometimes shows the peculiar laminated\r\nor scaly character of the bark when other characters are almost entirely\r\nobliterated. The leaves also are nearly as abundant as those of\r\nSigillaria in the coal-shales. They can readily be distinguished by their\r\nstrong, angular midrib.\r\n\r\nThe markings of _Lepidophloios_ may easily be mistaken for those of the\r\n_Clathraria_ type of _Sigillaria_. When the stem only is seen, they can\r\nbe distinguished by the length of the leaf-bases in _Lepidophloios_, and\r\nby the dominant central vascular scar; also by the one-nerved and ribbed\r\nleaves. Where the large, round marks of the cones are present, these are\r\nan infallible guide, never being present in _Sigillaria_. As the cones\r\ngrew on the upper sides of the branches, the impression of the lower side\r\noften shows no cone-scars, or only two lateral rows, whereas on the upper\r\nside of the same branch they appear spirally arranged. I may describe as\r\nan example--\r\n\r\n_Lepidophloios Acadianus_, Dawson. Leaf-bases broadly rhombic, or in old\r\nstems regularly rhombic, prominent, ascending, terminated by very broad\r\nrhombic scars having a central point and two lateral obscure points.\r\nOuter bark laminated or scaly. Surface of inner bark with single points\r\nor depressions. Leaves long, linear, with a strong keel on one side,\r\nfive inches or more in length. Cone-scars sparsely scattered on thick\r\nbranches, either in two rows or spirally, both modes being sometimes seen\r\non the same branch. Scalariform axis scarcely an inch in diameter in a\r\nstem five inches thick. Fruit, an ovate strobile with numerous acute\r\nscales covering small globular spore-cases. This species is closely\r\nallied to _Ulodendron majus_ and _Lepidophloios laricinus_, and presents\r\nnumerous varieties of marking. Coal-formation, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n_Family_ Calamiteæ; _Genus_ Calamites, Suckow.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this genus are unquestionably allied to the modern\r\n_Equisetaceæ_, but excel these so much in variety of form and structure,\r\nand are so capricious in their states of preservation, and so liable to\r\nbe mistaken for parts of plants generically different, that they have\r\ngiven rise to much controversy. The following considerations will enable\r\nus to arrive at some certainty.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Calamites_ was originally founded in the longitudinally\r\nribbed and jointed stems so frequent in the coal-formation, and of which\r\nthe common _C. Suckovii_ is a typical form. The most perfect of these\r\nstems represent the outer surface immediately within the epidermis, in\r\nwhich case transverse lines or constrictions mark the nodes, and at the\r\nnodes there are rounded spots, sometimes indicating radial processes of\r\nthe pith, first described by Williamson; in other cases, the attachment\r\nof branchlets, or in some specimens both. But some specimens show the\r\nouter surface of the epidermis, in which case the transverse nodal\r\nlines are usually invisible, though the scars of branchlets may appear.\r\nIn still other examples the whole of the outer tissues have perished,\r\nand the so-called Calamite is a cast of the interior of the stem,\r\nshowing merely longitudinal ribbing and transverse nodal constrictions.\r\nIn studying these plants _in situ_ in the erect Calamite brakes of\r\nthe coal-formation of Nova Scotia, one soon becomes familiar with\r\nthese appearances, but they are evidently unknown to the majority of\r\npalæobotanists, though described in detail more than twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen the outer surface is preserved it is sometimes seen to bear\r\nverticils of long needle-like leaves (_C. Cistii_), or of branchlets with\r\nsecondary whorls of similar leaves (_C. Suckovii_ and _C. undulatus_).\r\nNo Calamite known to me bears broad one-nerved leaves like those of\r\n_Asterophyllites_ and _Annularia_, though the larger stems of these\r\nplants have been described as Calamites, and the term _Calamocladus_ has\r\nbeen used to include both groups. The base of the Calamite stem usually\r\nterminates in a blunt point, and may be attached to a rhizome, or several\r\nstems may bud out from each other in a group or stool. The roots are long\r\nand cylindrical, sometimes branching. The fruit consists of spikes of\r\nspore-cases, borne in whorls and subtended by linear floral leaves. To\r\nthese strobiles the name Calamostachys has been given.\r\n\r\nWilliamson has shown that the stem of Calamites consists of a central\r\npith or cavity of large size surrounded by a cylinder consisting of\r\nalternate wedges of woody and cellular matter, with vertical canals at\r\nthe inner sides of the wedges, and slender medullary rays. The thick\r\ncellular wedges intervening between the woody wedges he calls primary\r\nmedullary rays; the smaller medullary rays in the wedges, secondary\r\nmedullary rays. There is thus a highly complex exogenous stem based on\r\nthe same principle with the stem of a common _Equisetum_, but with much\r\ngreater strength and complexity.\r\n\r\nWilliamson has also shown that there are different sub-types of these\r\nstems. More especially he refers to the three following:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Calamites_ proper, which has the woody wedges of scalariform or\r\nbarred tissue with thin medullary rays, and the thick primary medullary\r\nrays are cellular.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Calamopitus_ has reticulated or multiporous tissue in the woody\r\nwedges with medullary rays, and the primary medullary wedges are composed\r\nof elongated cells.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Calamodendron_ has the woody wedges of barred tissue as in _a_,\r\nwith medullary rays, but has the intervening medullary wedges of an\r\nelongated tissue approaching to woody fibre, and also with medullary rays.\r\n\r\nTo these I would add a fourth type, which I have described, from the\r\ncoal-formation of Nova Scotia.[DB]\r\n\r\n[DB] \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society,\" 1871.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Eucalamodendron_ differs from _Calamodendron_ in having true\r\nbordered pores or pseudo-scalariform slit-pored tissue, and corresponds\r\nto the highest type of calamitean stem.\r\n\r\nI would also add that under _a_ and _b_ there are some species in which\r\nthe woody cylinder is very thin in comparison to the size of the stem. In\r\n_c_ and _d_ the woody cylinder is thick and massive, and the stems are\r\noften large and nodose.\r\n\r\nAs an example of an ordinary Calamite in which the external surface and\r\nfoliage are preserved, I may quote the following from my report on the\r\n\"Flora of the Lower Carboniferous and Millstone Grit,\" 1873:\r\n\r\nCalamites Undulatus, Brongniart.--This species is stated by Brongniart\r\nto be distinguished from the _C. Suckovii_, the characteristic Calamite\r\nof the middle coal-formation, by its undulated ribs marked with peculiar\r\ncellular reticulation. He suggests that it may be merely a variety of\r\n_C. Suckovii_, an opinion in which Schimper coincides; but since I have\r\nreceived large additional collections from Mr. Elder, containing not\r\nonly the stems and branches, but also the leaves and rhizomes, I am\r\nconstrained to regard it as a distinct though closely allied species.\r\n\r\nThe rhizomata are slender, being from one to two inches in diameter,\r\nand perfectly flattened. They are beautifully covered with a cellular\r\nreticulation on the thin bark, and show occasional round areoles marking\r\nthe points of exit of the rootlets. I have long been familiar with\r\nirregular flattened stems thus reticulate, but have only recently been\r\nable to connect them with this species of Calamite.\r\n\r\nThe main stems present a very thin carbonaceous bark reticulated like\r\nthe rhizomes. They have flat, broad ribs separated by deep and narrow\r\nfurrows, and undulated in a remarkable manner even when the stems are\r\nflattened. This undulation is, however, perhaps an indication of vertical\r\npressure while the plant was living, as it seems to have had an unusually\r\nthin and feeble cortical layer, and the undulations are apparently best\r\ndeveloped in the lower part of the stem. At the nodes the ribs are often\r\nnarrowed and gathered together, especially in the vicinity of the rounded\r\nradiating marks which appear to indicate the points of insertion of\r\nthe branches. At the top of each rib we have the usual rounded areole,\r\nprobably marking the insertion of a primary branchlet.\r\n\r\nThe branches have slender ribs and distant nodes, from which spring\r\nsecondary branchlet s in whorls, these bearing in turn small whorls of\r\nacicular leaflets much curved upward, and which are apparently round in\r\ncross section and delicately striate. They are much shorter than the\r\nleaves of _Calamites Suckovii_, and are less dense and less curved than\r\nthose of _C. nodosus_, which I believe to be the two most closely allied\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nLesquereux notices this species as characteristic of the lower part of\r\nthe Carboniferous in Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that I regard the striated and ribbed stems not as\r\ninternal axes, but as representing the outer surface of the plants. This\r\nwas certainly the case with the present species and with _C. Suckovii_\r\nand _C. nodosus_. Other species, and especially those which belonged to\r\nCalamodendron, no doubt had a smooth or irregularly wrinkled external\r\nbark; but this gives no good ground for the manner in which some writers\r\non this subject confound Calamites with Calamodendra, and both with\r\nAsterophyllites and Sphenophyllum. With this no one who has studied these\r\nplants, rooted in their native soils, and with their appendages still\r\nattached, can for a moment sympathise. One of the earliest geological\r\nstudies of the writer was a bed of these erect Calamites, which he\r\nshowed to Sir C. Lyell in 1844, and described in the \"Proceedings of\r\nthe Geological Society\" in 1851, illustrating the habit of growth as\r\nactually seen well exposed in a sandstone cliff. Abundant opportunities\r\nof verifying the conclusions formed at that time have since occurred,\r\nthe results of which have been summed up in the figures in Acadian\r\nGeology, which, though they have been treated by some botanists as merely\r\nrestorations, are in reality representations of facts actually observed.\r\n\r\nOn these subjects, without entering into details, and referring for these\r\nto the elaborate discussions of Schimper, Williamson, and McNab, and to\r\nmy paper on the subject, \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" vol. xxvii,\r\np. 54, I may remark:\r\n\r\n1. That the aërial stems of ordinary Calamites had a thin cortical layer,\r\nwith lacunæ and fibrous bundles and multiporous vessels--the whole not\r\ndiffering much from the structure of modern Equiseta.\r\n\r\n2. Certain arborescent forms, perhaps allied to the true Calamites,\r\nas well as possibly the old underground stems of ordinary species[DC]\r\nassumed a thick-walled character in which the tissues resembled the\r\nwedges of an exogen, and abundance of pseudo-scalariform fibres were\r\ndeveloped, while the ribbing of the external surface became obsolete or\r\nwas replaced by a mere irregular wrinkling.\r\n\r\n[DC] Williamson, \"Transactions of the Royal Society.\" McNab, in\r\n\"Proceedings of the Edinburgh Botanical Society.\"\r\n\r\n3. Sufficient discrimination has not been exercised in separating casts\r\nof the internal cavities of Calamites and Calamodendron from those\r\nrepresenting other surfaces and the proper external surface.\r\n\r\n4. There is no excuse for attributing to Calamites the foliage of\r\nAnnularia, Asterophyllites, and Sphenophyllum, since these leaves have\r\nnot been found attached to true Calamite stems, and since the structure\r\nof the stems of Asterophyllites as described by Williamson, and that of\r\nSphenophyllum as described by the writer,[DD] are essentially different\r\nfrom those of Calamites.\r\n\r\n[DD] \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" 1866.\r\n\r\n5. As the species above described indicates, good external characters can\r\nbe found for establishing species of this genus, and these species are of\r\nvalue as marks of geological age.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Archæocalamites, Sternberg.\r\n\r\nThis genus has been established to include certain Calamites of the\r\nDevonian and Lower Carboniferous, in which the furrows on the stem do not\r\nalternate at the nodes or joints, and the leaves in one species at least\r\nbifurcate. _C. radiatus_, Brongniart, is the typical species. In North\r\nAmerica it occurs in the Erian, probably as low as the Middle Erian. In\r\nEurope it has so far been recognised in the Lower Carboniferous only. I\r\nhave, however, seen stems from alleged Devonian beds in Devonshire which\r\nmay have belonged to this species.\r\n\r\n_Family_ Asterophylliteæ; _Genus_ Asterophyllites, Brongniart.\r\n\r\nStems ribbed and jointed like the _Calamites_, but with inflated nodes\r\nand a stout internal woody cylinder, which has been described by\r\nWilliamson. From the joints proceeded whorls of leaves or of branchlets,\r\nbearing leaves which differed from those of _Calamites_ in their having\r\na distinct middle rib or vein. The fructification consisted of long\r\nslender cones or spikes, having whorls of scales bearing the spore-cases.\r\nSome authors speak of _Asterophyllites_ as only branches and leaves of\r\n_Calamites_; but though at first sight the resemblance is great, a close\r\ninspection shows that the leaves of Asterophyllites have a true midrib,\r\nwhich is wanting in _Calamites_.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Annularia.--It is perhaps questionable whether these plants\r\nshould be separated from _Asterophyllites_, The distinction is that\r\nthey produce branches in pairs, and that their whorls of leaves are\r\none-sided and usually broader than those of _Asterophyllites_, and united\r\ninto a ring at their insertion on the stem. One little species, _A.\r\nsphenophylloides_, is very widely distributed.\r\n\r\nPinnularia--a provisional genus---includes slender roots or stems\r\nbranching in a pinnate manner, and somewhat irregularly. They are very\r\nabundant in the coal shales, and were probably not independent plants,\r\nbut aquatic roots belonging to some of the plants last mentioned.\r\nThe probability of this is farther increased by their resemblance in\r\nminiature to the roots of _Calamites_. They are always flattened, but\r\nseem originally to have been round, with a slender thread-like axis of\r\nscalariform vessels, enclosed in a soft, smooth, cellular bark.\r\n\r\n_Family_ Rhizocarpeæ; _Genus_ Sphenophyllum.\r\n\r\nLeaves in whorls, wedge-shaped, with forking veins. Fructification on\r\nspikes, with verticils of sporocarps. These plants are by some regarded\r\nas allied to the _Calamiteæ_ and _Asterophylliteæ_, by others as a high\r\ngrade of Rhizocarps of the type of Marsilia. The stem had a star-shaped\r\ncentral bundle of scalariform or reticulato-scalariform vessels.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Sporangites. (_Sporocarpon_, Williamson.)\r\n\r\nUnder this name we may provisionally include those rounded spherical\r\nbodies found in the coal and its accompanying beds, and also in\r\nthe Erian, which may be regarded as Macrospores or Sporocarps of\r\nProtosalvinia, or other Rhizocarpean plants akin to those described above\r\nin Chapter III, which see for description.\r\n\r\n_Genus_ Protosalvinia.--Under this we include sporocarps allied to those\r\nof _Salvinia_, as described in Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Family_ Filices.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I shall merely refer to a few groups of special interest,\r\nand to the provisional arrangement adopted for the fronds of ferns when\r\ndestitute of fructification.\r\n\r\nThe external appearances of trunks of tree-ferns have been already\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nWith respect to tree ferns, the oldest known examples are those from\r\nthe Middle Devonian of New York and Ohio, which I have described in the\r\n\"Journal of the Geological Society,\" 1871 and 1881. As these are of some\r\ninterest, I have reproduced their descriptions in a note appended to\r\nChapter III, which see.\r\n\r\nThe other forms most frequently occurring in the Carboniferous are\r\n_Caulopteris_, _Palæopteris_, and _Megaphyton_[DE] Stems showing merely\r\nmasses of aërial roots are known by the name _Psaronius_.\r\n\r\n[DE] See my \"Acadian Geology,\" also below.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the classification of Palæozoic ferns, this has\r\nhitherto been quite arbitrary, being based on mere form and venation of\r\nfronds, but much advance has recently been made in the knowledge of their\r\nfructification, warranting a more definite attempt at classification. The\r\nfollowing are provisional genera usually adopted:\r\n\r\n1. _Cyclopteris_, Brongniart.--Leaflets more or less rounded or\r\nwedge-shaped, without midrib, the nerves spreading from the point of\r\nattachment. This group includes a great variety of fronds evidently of\r\ndifferent genera, were their fructification known; and some of them\r\nprobably portions of fronds, the other parts of which may be in the next\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\n2. _Neuropteris_, Brongniart.--Fronds pinnate, and with the leaflets\r\nnarrowed at the base; midrib often not distinct, and disappearing toward\r\nthe apex. Nervures equal, and rising at an acute angle. Ferns of this\r\ntype are among the most abundant in the coal-formation.\r\n\r\n3. _Odontopteris_, Brongniart.--In these the frond is pinnate, and\r\nthe leaflets are attached by their whole base, with the nerves either\r\nproceeding wholly from the base, or in part from an indistinct midrib,\r\nwhich soon divides into nervures.\r\n\r\n4. _Dictyopteris_, Gutbier.--This is a beautiful style of fern, with\r\nleaflets resembling those of _Neuropteris_, but the veins arranged\r\nin a network of oval spaces. Only a few species are known in the\r\ncoal-formation.\r\n\r\n5. _Lonchopteris_, Brongniart.--Ferns with netted veins like the above,\r\nbut with a distinct midrib, and the leaflets attached by the whole base.\r\nOf this, also, we can boast but few species.\r\n\r\n6. _Sphenopteris_, Brongniart.--These are elegant ferns, very numerous\r\nin species, and most difficult to discriminate. Their most distinctive\r\ncharacters are leaflets narrowed at the base, often lobed, and with\r\nnervures dividing in a pinnate manner from the base.\r\n\r\n7. _Phyllopteris_, Brongniart.--These are pinnate, with long lanceolate\r\npinnules, having a strong and well-defined midrib, and nerves proceeding\r\nfrom it very obliquely, and dividing as they proceed toward the margin.\r\nThe ferns of this genus are for the most part found in formations more\r\nrecent than the Carboniferous; but I have referred to it, with some\r\ndoubt, one of our species.\r\n\r\n8. _Alethopteris_, Brongniart.--This genus includes many of the most\r\ncommon coal-formation ferns, especially the ubiquitous _A. lonchitica_,\r\nwhich seems to have been the common brake of the coal-formation,\r\ncorresponding to _Pteris aquilina_ in modern Europe and America. These\r\nare brake-like ferns, pinnate, with leaflets often long and narrow,\r\ndecurrent on the petiole, adherent by their whole base, and united at\r\nbase to each other. The midrib is continuous to the point, and the\r\nnervures run off from it nearly at right angles. In some of these ferns\r\nthe fructification is known to have been marginal, as in _Pteris_.\r\n\r\n9. _Pecopteris_, Brongniart.--This genus is intermediate between the\r\nlast and _Neuropteris_. The leaflets are attached by the whole base,\r\nbut not usually attached to each other; the midrib, though slender,\r\nattains to the summit; the nervures are given off less obliquely than\r\nin _Neuropteris_. This genus includes a large number of our most common\r\nfossil ferns.\r\n\r\n10. _Beinertia_, Goeppert.--A genus established by Goeppert for a curious\r\nPecopteris-like fern, with flexuous branching oblique nervures becoming\r\nparallel to the edge of the frond.\r\n\r\n11. _Hymenophyllites_, Goeppert.--These are ferns similar to\r\nSphenopteris, but divided at the margin into one-nerved lobes, in the\r\nmanner of the modern genus _Hymenophyllum_.\r\n\r\n12. _Palæopteris_, Geinitz.--This is a genus formed to include certain\r\ntrunks of tree-ferns with oval transverse scars of leaves.\r\n\r\n13. _Caulopteris_, Lindley and Hutton.--Is another genus of fossil trunks\r\nof tree-ferns, but with elongate scars of leaves.\r\n\r\n14. _Psaronius_, Cotta.--Includes other trunks of tree-ferns with\r\nalternate scars or thick scales, and ordinarily with many aërial roots\r\ngrouped round them, as in some modern tree-ferns.\r\n\r\n15. _Megaphyton_, Artis.--Includes trunks of tree-ferns which bore their\r\nfronds, which were of great size, in two rows, one on each side of the\r\nstem. These were very peculiar trees, less like modern ferns than any\r\nof the others. My reasons for regarding them as ferns are stated in the\r\nfollowing extract from a recent paper:\r\n\r\n\"Their thick stems, marked with linear scars and having two rows of\r\nlarge depressed areoles on the sides, suggest no affinities to any known\r\nplants. They are usually ranked with _Lepidodendron_ and _Ulodendron_,\r\nbut sometimes, and probably with greater reason, are regarded as allied\r\nto tree-ferns. At the Joggins a very fine species (_M. magnificum_) has\r\nbeen found, and at Sydney a smaller species (_M. humile_); but both\r\nare rare and not well preserved. If the large scars bore cones and the\r\nsmaller bore leaves, then, as Brongniart remarks, the plant would much\r\nresemble _Lepidophloios_, in which the cone-scars are thus sometimes\r\ndistichous. But the scars are not round and marked with radiating scales\r\nas in _Lepidophloios_; they are reniform or oval, and resemble those\r\nof tree-ferns, for which reason they may be regarded as more probably\r\nleaf-scars; and in that case the smaller linear scars would indicate\r\nramenta, or small aërial roots. Further, the plant described by Corda\r\nas _Zippea disticha_ is evidently a _Megaphyton_, and the structure\r\nof that species is plainly that of a tree-fern of somewhat peculiar\r\ntype. On these grounds I incline to the opinion of Geinitz that these\r\ncurious trees were allied to ferns, and bore two rows of large fronds,\r\nthe trunks being covered with coarse hairs or small aërial roots. At\r\none time I was disposed to suspect that they may have crept along the\r\nground; but a specimen from Sydney shows the leaf-stalks proceeding from\r\nthe stem at an angle so acute that the stem must, I think, have been\r\nerect. From the appearance of the scars it is probable that only a pair\r\nof fronds were borne at one time at the top of the stem; and, if these\r\nwere broad and spreading, it would be a very graceful plant. To what\r\nextent plants of this type contributed to the accumulation of coal I have\r\nno means of ascertaining, their tissues in the state of coal not being\r\ndistinguishable from those of ferns and _Lycopodiaceæ_.\"\r\n\r\n16. For descriptions of the genus _Archæopteris_ and other Erian ferns,\r\nsee Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  THE FLORA OF THE EARLY MESOZOIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat physical changes occurred at the close of the Carboniferous age.\r\nThe thick beds of sediment that had been accumulating in long lines\r\nalong the primitive continents had weighed down the earth's crust. Slow\r\nsubsidence had been proceeding from this cause in the coal-formation\r\nperiod, and at its close vast wrinklings occurred, only surpassed by\r\nthose of the old Laurentian time. Hence in the Appalachian region of\r\nAmerica we have the Carboniferous beds thrown into abrupt folds, their\r\nshales converted into hard slates, their sandstones into quartzite and\r\ntheir coals into anthracite, and all this before the deposition of the\r\nTriassic Red Sandstones which constitute the earliest deposit of the\r\ngreat succeeding Mesozoic period. In like manner the coal-fields of Wales\r\nand elsewhere in western Europe have suffered similar treatment, and\r\napparently at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis folding is, however, on both sides of the Atlantic limited to a\r\nband on the margin of the continents, and to certain interior lines of\r\npressure, while in the middle, as in Ohio and Illinois in America, and\r\nin the great interior plains of Europe, the coal-beds are undisturbed\r\nand unaltered. In connection with this we have an entire change in the\r\nphysical character of the deposits, a great elevation of the borders\r\nof the continents, and probably a considerable deepening of the seas,\r\nleading to the establishment of general geographical conditions which\r\nstill remain, though they have been temporarily modified by subsequent\r\nsubsidences and re-elevations.\r\n\r\nAlong with this a great change was in progress in vegetable and animal\r\nlife. The flora and fauna of the Palæozoic gradually die out in the\r\nPermian and are replaced in the succeeding Trias by those of the Mesozoic\r\ntime. Throughout the Permian, however, the remains of the coal-formation\r\nflora continue to exist, and some forms, as the _Calamites_, even seem\r\nto gain in importance, as do also certain types of coniferous trees. The\r\nTriassic, as well as the Permian, was marked by physical disturbances,\r\nmore especially by great volcanic eruptions discharging vast beds and\r\ndykes of lava and layers of volcanic ash and agglomerate. This was the\r\ncase more especially along the margins of the Atlantic, and probably\r\nalso on those of the Pacific. The volcanic sheets and dykes associated\r\nwith the Red Sandstones of Nova Scotia, Connecticut, and New Jersey are\r\nevidences of this.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Permian and beginning of the Trias, in the midst of\r\nthis transition time of physical disturbance, appear the great reptilian\r\nforms characteristic of the age of reptiles, and the earliest precursors\r\nof the mammals, and at this time the old Carboniferous forms of plants\r\nfinally pass away, to be replaced by a flora scarcely more advanced,\r\nthough different, and consisting of pines, cycads, and ferns, with\r\ngigantic equiseta, which are the successors of the genus _Calamites_,\r\na genus which still survives in the early Trias. Of these groups the\r\nconifers, the ferns, and the equiseta are already familiar to us, and, in\r\nso far as they are concerned, a botanist who had studied the flora of the\r\nCarboniferous would have found himself at home in the succeeding period.\r\nThe cycads are a new introduction. The whole, however, come within the\r\nlimits of the cryptogams and the gymnosperms, so that here we have no\r\nadvance.[DF]\r\n\r\n[DF] Fontaine's \"Early Mesozoic Flora of Virginia\" gives a very good\r\nsummary of this flora in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Jurassic vegetation. Cycads and pines. (After\r\nSaporta.)]\r\n\r\nAs we ascend, however, in the Mesozoic, we find new and higher types.\r\nEven within the Jurassic epoch, the next in succession to the Trias,\r\nthere are clear indications of the presence of the endogens, in species\r\nallied to the screw-pines and grasses; and the palms appear a little\r\nlater, while a few exogenous trees have left their remains in the Lower\r\nCretaceous, and in the Middle and Upper Cretaceous these higher plants\r\ncome in abundantly and in generic forms still extant, so that the dawn\r\nof the modern flora belongs to the Middle and Upper Cretaceous. It will\r\nthus be convenient to confine ourselves in this chapter to the flora of\r\nthe earlier Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nPassing over for the present the cryptogamous plants already familiar\r\nin older deposits, we may notice the new features of gymnospermous and\r\nphænogamous life, as they present themselves in this earlier part of the\r\ngreat reptilian age, and as they extended themselves with remarkable\r\nuniformity in this period over all parts of the world. For it is a\r\nremarkable fact that, if we place together in our collections fossil\r\nplants of this period from Australia, India, China, Siberia, Europe,\r\nor even from Greenland, we find wonderfully little difference in their\r\naspect. This uniformity we have already seen prevailed in the Palæozoic\r\nflora; and it is perhaps equally marked in that of the Mesozoic. Still we\r\nmust bear in mind that some of the plants of these periods, as the ferns\r\nand pines, for example, are still world-wide in their distribution; but\r\nthis does not apply to others, more especially the cycads (Fig. 65).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--_Podozamites lanceolatus_, Sternb. L.\r\nCretaceous.]\r\n\r\nThe cycads constitute a singular and exceptional type in the modern\r\nworld, and are limited at present to the warmer climates, though very\r\ngenerally distributed in these, as they occur in Africa, India, Japan,\r\nAustralia, Mexico, Florida, and the West Indies. In the Mesozoic age,\r\nhowever, they were world-wide in their distribution, and are found as far\r\nnorth as Greenland, though most of the species found in the Cretaceous\r\nof that country are of small size/ and may have been of low growth, so\r\nthat they may have been protected by the snows of winter. The cycads\r\nhave usually simple or unbranching stems, pinnate leaves borne in a\r\ncrown at top, and fruits which, though somewhat various in structure and\r\narrangement, are all of the simpler form of gymnospermous type. The stems\r\nare exogenous in structure, but with slender wood and thick bark, and\r\nbarred tissue, or properly as tissue intermediate between this and the\r\ndisc-bearing fibres of the pines.\r\n\r\nThough the cycads have a considerable range of organisation and of\r\nfructification, and though some points in reference to the latter might\r\nassign them a higher place, on the whole they seem to occupy a lower\r\nposition than the conifers or the cordaiteæ of the Carboniferous.\r\nIn the Carboniferous some of the fern-like leaves assigned to the\r\ngenus _Noeggerathia_ have been shown by Stur and Weiss to have been\r\ngymnosperms, probably allied to cycads, of which they may be regarded at\r\nleast as precursors. Thus the cycadean type does not really constitute an\r\nadvance in grade of organisation in the Mesozoic, any further than that,\r\nin the period now in question, it becomes much more developed in number\r\nand variety of forms. But the conifers would seem to have had precedence\r\nof it for a long time in the Palæozoic, and it replaces in the Mesozoic\r\nthe _Cordaites_, which in many respects excelled it in complexity.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the cycads of the Mesozoic age would seem to have had\r\nshort stems and to have constituted the undergrowth of woods in which\r\nconifers attained to greater height. An interesting case of this is the\r\ncelebrated dirt-bed of the quarries of the Isle of Portland, long ago\r\ndescribed by Dean Buckland. In this fossil soil trunks of pines, which\r\nmust have attained to great height, are interspersed with the short,\r\nthick stems of cycads, of the genus named _Cycadoidea_ by Buckland,\r\nand which from their appearance are called \"fossil birds' nests\" by the\r\nquarrymen. Some, however, must have attained a considerable height so as\r\nto resemble palms.\r\n\r\nThe cycads, with their simple, thick trunks, usually marked with rhombic\r\nscars, and bearing broad spreading crowns of large, elegantly formed\r\npinnate leaves, must have formed a prominent part of the vegetation\r\nof the northern hemisphere during the whole of the Mesozoic period. A\r\nbotanist, had there been such a person at the time, would have found\r\nthis to be the case everywhere from the equator to Spitzbergen, and\r\nprobably in the southern hemisphere as well, and this throughout all\r\nthe long periods from the Early Trias to the Middle Cretaceous. In a\r\npaper published in the \"Linnæan Transactions\" for 1868, Dr. Carruthers\r\nenumerates twenty species of British Mesozoic cycads, and the number\r\nmight now be considerably increased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--_Salisburia_ (Gingko) _Sibirica_, Heer. L.\r\nCretaceous, Siberia and North America.]\r\n\r\nThe pines present some features of interest. We have already seen their\r\nconnection with the broad-leaved _Cordaites_, and in the Permian there\r\nare some additional types of broad-leaved coniferæ. In the Mesozoic we\r\nhave great numbers of beautiful trees, with those elegant fan-shaped\r\nleaves characteristic of but one living species, the Salisburia, or\r\ngingko-tree of China. It is curious that this tree, though now limited\r\nto eastern Asia, will grow, though it rarely fruits, in most parts of\r\ntemperate Europe, and in America as far north as Montreal, and that in\r\nthe Mesozoic period it occupied all these regions, and even Siberia and\r\nGreenland, and with many and diversified species (Fig. 66).\r\n\r\n_Salisburia_ belongs to the yews, but an equally curious fact applies to\r\nthe cypresses. The genus _Sequoia_, limited at present to two species,\r\nboth Californian, and one of them the so-called \"big tree,\" celebrated\r\nfor the gigantic size to which it attains, is represented by species\r\nfound as far back at least as the Lower Cretaceous, and in every part\r\nof the northern hemisphere.[DG] It seems to have thriven in all these\r\nregions throughout the Mesozoic and early Kainozoic, and then to have\r\ndisappeared, leaving only a small remnant to represent it in modern days.\r\nA number of species have been described from the Mesozoic and Tertiary,\r\nall of them closely related to those now existing (Fig. 67).\r\n\r\n[DG] In the Eocene of Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--_Sequoia Smithiana_, Heer. L. Cretaceous.]\r\n\r\nThe following notice of these trees is for the most part translated, with\r\nsome modifications and abridgment, from a paper read by the late Prof.\r\nHeer before the Botanical Section of the Swiss Natural History Society:\r\n\r\nThe name itself deserves consideration. It is that of an Indian of the\r\nCherokee tribe, Sequo Yah, who invented an alphabet without any aid from\r\nthe outside world of culture, and taught it to his tribe by writing it\r\nupon leaves. This came into general use among the Cherokees, before the\r\nwhite man had any knowledge of it; and afterward, in 1828, a periodical\r\nwas published in this character by the missionaries. Sequo Yah was\r\nbanished from his home in Alabama, with the rest of his tribe, and\r\nsettled in New Mexico, where he died in 1843.\r\n\r\nWhen Endlicher was preparing his synopsis of the conifers, in 1846, and\r\nhad established a number of new genera, Dr. Jacbon Tschudi, then living\r\nwith Endlicher, brought before his notice this remarkable man, and asked\r\nhim to dedicate this red-wooded tree to the memory of a literary genius\r\nso conspicuous among the red men of America. Endlicher consented to do\r\nso, and only endeavored to make the name pronounceable by changing two of\r\nits letters.\r\n\r\nEndlicher founded the genus on the redwood of the Americans, _Taxodium\r\nsempervirens_ of Lamb; and named the species _Sequoia sempervirens_.\r\nThese trees form large forests in California, which extend along the\r\ncoast as far as Oregon. Trees are there met with of 300 feet in height\r\nand 20 feet in diameter. The seeds have been brought to Europe a number\r\nof years ago, and we already see in upper Italy and around the Lake of\r\nGeneva, and in England, high trees; but, on the other hand, they have not\r\nproved successful around Zurich.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, a second species of Sequoia was discovered in California, which,\r\nunder the name of big tree, soon attained a considerable celebrity.\r\nLindley described it, in 1853, as _Wellingtonia gigantea_; and, in the\r\nfollowing year, Decaisne and Torrey proved that it belonged to Sequoia,\r\nand that it accordingly should be called _Sequoia gigantea_.\r\n\r\nWhile the _Sequoia sempervirens_, in spite of the destructiveness of\r\nthe American lumbermen, still forms large forests along the coast, the\r\n_Sequoia gigantea_ is confined to the isolated clumps which are met with\r\ninland at a height of 5,000 to 7,000 feet above sea-level, and are much\r\nsought after by tourists as one of the wonders of the country. Reports\r\ncame to Europe concerning the largest of them which were quite fabulous,\r\nbut we have received accurate accounts of them from Prof. Whitney. The\r\ntallest tree measured by him has a height of 325 feet, and in the case of\r\none of the trees the number of the rings of growth indicated an age of\r\nabout 1,300 years. It had a girth of 50 to 60 feet.\r\n\r\nWe know only two living species of _Sequoia_, both of which are confined\r\nto California. The one (_S. sempervirens_) is clothed with erect leaves,\r\narranged in two rows, very much like our yew-tree, and bears small, round\r\ncones; the other (_S. gigantea_) has smaller leaves, set closely against\r\nthe branches, giving the tree more the appearance of the cypress. The\r\ncones are egg-shaped, and much larger. These two types are therefore\r\nsharply defined.\r\n\r\nBoth of these trees have an interesting history. If we go back into the\r\nTertiary, this same genus meets us with a long array of species. Two of\r\nthese species correspond to those living at present: the _S. Langsdorfii_\r\nto the _S. sempervirens_, and the _S. Couttsiæ_ to the _S. gigantea_.[DH]\r\nBut, while the living species are confined to California, in the Tertiary\r\nthey are spread over several quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\n[DH] _S. Couttsiæ_ has leaves like _S. gigantea_, and cones like those of\r\n_8. sempervirens_.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the _Sequoia Langsdorfii_. This was first\r\ndiscovered in the lignite of Wetterau, and was described as _Taxites\r\nlangsdorfii_. Heer found it in the upper Rhone district, and there lay\r\nbeside the twigs the remains of a cone, which showed that the _Taxites\r\nLangsdorfii_ of Brongniart belonged to the Californian genus Sequoia\r\nestablished by Endlicher. He afterward found much better preserved\r\ncones, together with seeds, along with the plants of east Greenland,\r\nwhich fully confirmed the determination. At Atanekerdluk in Greenland\r\n(about 70° north latitude) this tree is very common. The leaves, and\r\nalso the flowers and numerous cones, leave no doubt that it stands very\r\nnear to the modern redwood. It differs from it, however, in having\r\na much larger number of scales in the cone. The tree is also found\r\nin Spitzbergen at nearly 78° north latitude, where Nordenskiöld has\r\ncollected, at Cape Lyell, wonderfully preserved branches. From this high\r\nlatitude the species can be followed down through the whole of Europe\r\nas far as the middle of Italy (at Senegaglia, Gulf of Spezia). In Asia,\r\nalso,, we can follow it to the steppes of Kirghisen, to Possiet, and to\r\nthe coast of the Sea of Japan, and across to Alaska and Sitka. It is\r\nrecognized by Mr. Starkie Gardner as one of the species found in the\r\nEocene of Mull in the Hebrides.[DI] It is thus known in Europe, Asia, and\r\nAmerica, from 43° to 78° north latitude, while its most nearly related\r\nliving species, perhaps even descended from it, is now confined to\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n[DI] It is _Fareites Campbelli_ of Forbes.\r\n\r\nWith this _S. Langsdorfii_, three other Tertiary species are\r\nnearly related (_S. brevifolia_, Hr., _S. disticha_, Hr., and _S.\r\nNordenskiöldi_, Hr.). These have been met with in Greenland and\r\nSpitzbergen, and one of them has lately been found in the United States.\r\nThree other species, in addition to these, have been described by\r\nLesquereux, which appear to belong to the group of the _S. Langsdorfii_,\r\nviz., _S. longifolia_, Lesq., _S. angustifolia_, and _S. acuminata_,\r\nLesq. Several species also occur in the Cretaceous and Eocene of Canada.\r\n\r\nThese species thus answer to the living _Sequoia sempervirens_; but we\r\ncan also point to Tertiary representatives of the _S. gigantea_. Their\r\nleases are stiff and sharp-pointed, are thinly set round the branches,\r\nand lie forward in the same way: the egg-shaped cones are in some cases\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, in the early Tertiary six species, which fill up\r\nthe gap between _S. sempervirens_ and _S. gigantea_. They are the _S.\r\nCouttsiæ_, _S. affinis_, Lesq., _S. imbricata_, Hr., _S. sibirica_, Hr.,\r\n_S. Heerii_, Lesq., and _S. biformis_, Lesq. Of these, _S. Couttsiæ_,\r\nHr., is the most common and most important species. It has short leaves,\r\nlying along the branch, like _S. gigantea_, and small, round cones, like\r\n_S. Langsdorfii_ and _sempervirens_. Bovey Tracey in Devonshire has\r\nafforded splendid specimens of cones, seeds, and twigs, which have been\r\ndescribed in the \"Philosophical Transactions.\" More lately, Count Saporta\r\nhas described specimens of cones and twigs from Armissan. Specimens of\r\nthis species have also been found in the older Tertiary of Greenland, so\r\nthat it must have had a wide range. It is very like to the American _S.\r\naffinis_, Lesq.\r\n\r\nIn the Tertiary there have been already found fourteen well-marked\r\nspecies, which thus include representatives of the two living types, _S.\r\nsempervirens_ and _S. gigantea_.\r\n\r\nWe can follow this genus still further back. If we go back to the\r\nCretaceous age, we find ten species, of which five occur in the Urgon\r\nof the Lower Cretaceous, two in the Middle, and three in the Upper\r\nCretaceous. Among these, the Lower Cretaceous exhibits the two types\r\nof the Sequoia sempervirens and _S. gigantea_. To the former the _S.\r\nSmithiana_ answers, and to the latter, the _Reichenbachii_, Gein. The\r\n_S. Smithiana_ stands indeed uncommonly near the _S. Langsdorfii_, both\r\nin the appearance of the leaves on the twigs and in the shape of the\r\ncones. These are, however, smaller, and the leaves do not become narrower\r\ntoward the base. The _S. pectina_, Hr., of the Upper Cretaceous, has its\r\nleaves arranged in two rows, and presents a similar appearance. The _S.\r\nReichenbachii_ is a type more distinct from those now living and those\r\nin the Tertiary. It has indeed stiff, pointed leaves, lying forward, but\r\nthey are arcuate, and the cones are smaller. This tree has been known\r\nfor a long time, and it serves in the Cretaceous as a guiding star,\r\nwhich we can follow from the Urgonian of the Lower Cretaceous up to the\r\nCenomanian. It is known in France, Belgium, Bohemia, Saxony, Greenland,\r\nand Spitzbergen (also in Canada and the United States). It has been\r\nplaced in another genus--Geinitzia--but we can recognise, by the help of\r\nthe cones, that it belongs to Sequoia.\r\n\r\nBelow this, there is found in Greenland a nearly related species, the _S.\r\nambigua_, Hr., of which the leaves are shorter and broader, and the cones\r\nround and somewhat smaller.\r\n\r\nThe connecting link between _S. Smithiana_ and _Reichenbachii_ is formed\r\nby _S. subulata_, Hr., and _S. rigida_, Hr., and three species (_S.\r\ngracilis_, Hr., _S. fastigiata_ and _S. Gardneriana_, Carr.), with leaves\r\nlying closely along the branch, and which come very near to the Tertiary\r\nspecies _S. Couttsiæ_. We have therefore in the Cretaceous quite an\r\narray of species, which fill up the gap between the _S. sempervirens_\r\nand _gigantea_, and show us that the genus Sequoia had already attained\r\na great development in the Cretaceous. This was still greater in\r\nthe Tertiary, in which it also reached its maximum of geographical\r\ndistribution. Into the present world the two extremes of the genus have\r\nalone continued; the numerous species forming its main body have fallen\r\nout in the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nIf we look still further back, we find in the Jura a great number of\r\nconifers, and, among them, we meet in the genus Pinus with a type which\r\nis highly developed, and which still survives; but for Sequoia we have\r\ntill now looked in vain, so that for the present we can not place the\r\nrise of the genus lower than the Urgonian of the Cretaceous, however\r\nremarkable we may think it that in that period it should have developed\r\ninto so many species; and it is still more surprising that two species\r\nalready make their appearance which approach so near to the living\r\n_Sequoia sempervirens_ and _S. gigantea_.\r\n\r\nAltogether, we have become acquainted, up to the present time, with\r\ntwenty-six species of Sequoia. Fourteen of these species are found in the\r\nArctic zone, and have been described and figured in the \"Fossil Flora of\r\nthe Arctic Regions.\" Sequoia has been recognised by Ettingshausen even in\r\nAustralia, but there in the Eocene.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, the most remarkable record in the whole history of\r\nvegetation. The Sequoias are the giants of the conifers, the grandest\r\nrepresentatives of the family, and the fact that, after spreading over\r\nthe whole northern hemisphere and attaining to more than twenty specific\r\nforms, their decaying remnant should now be confined to one limited\r\nregion in western America and to two species constitutes a sad memento\r\nof departed greatness.[DJ] The small remnant of _S. gigantea_ still,\r\nhowever, towers above all competitors, as eminently the \"big trees \";\r\nbut, had they and the allied species failed to escape the Tertiary\r\ncontinental submergences and the disasters of the glacial period, this\r\ngrand genus would have been to us an extinct type. In like manner the\r\nsurvival of the single gingko of eastern Asia alone enables us to\r\nunderstand that great series of taxine trees with fern-like leaves of\r\nwhich it is the sole representative.\r\n\r\n[DJ] The writer has shown that much of the material of the great lignite\r\nbeds of the Canadian Northwest consists of wood of Sequoia of both the\r\nmodern types.\r\n\r\nBesides these peculiar and now rare forms, we have in the Mesozoic many\r\nothers related closely to existing yews, cypresses, pines, and spruces,\r\nso that the conifers were probably in greater abundance and variety than\r\nthey are at this day.\r\n\r\nIn this period, also, we find the earliest representatives of\r\nthe endogenous plants. It is true that some plants found in the\r\ncoal-formation have been doubtfully referred to these, but the earliest\r\ncertain examples would seem to be some bamboo-like and screw-pine-like\r\nplants occurring in the Jurassic rocks. Some of these are, it is true,\r\ndoubtful forms, but of others there seems to be no question. The modern\r\n_Pandanus_ or screw-pine of the tropical regions, which is not a pine,\r\nhowever, but a humble relation of the palms, is a stiffly branching\r\ntree, of a candelabra-like form, and with tufts of long leaves on its\r\nbranches, and nuts or great hard berries for fruit, borne sometimes in\r\nlarge masses, and so protected as to admit of their drifting uninjured\r\non the sea. The stems are supported by masses of aërial roots like those\r\nwhich strengthen the stems of tree-ferns. These structures and habits\r\nof growth fit the Pandanus for its especial habitat on the shores of\r\ntropical islands, to which its masses of nuts are drifted by the winds\r\nand currents, and on whose shores it can establish itself by the aid of\r\nits aërial roots.\r\n\r\nSome plants referred to the cycads have proved veritable botanical\r\npuzzles. One of these, the _Williamsonia gigas_ of the English oölite,\r\noriginally discovered by my friend Dr. Williamson, and named by him\r\n_Zamia gigas_, a very tall and beautiful species, found in rocks of this\r\nage in various parts of Europe, has been claimed by Saporta for the\r\nEndogens, as a plant allied to _Pandanus_. Some other botanists have\r\nsupposed the flowers and fruits to be parasites on other plants, like the\r\nmodern _Rafflesia_ of Sumatra, but it is possible that after all it may\r\nprove to have been an aberrant cycad.\r\n\r\nThe tree-palms are not found earlier than the Middle Cretaceous, where\r\nwe shall notice them in the next chapter. In like manner, though a\r\nfew Angiosperms occur in rocks believed to be Lower or Lower Middle\r\nCretaceous in Greenland and the northwest territory of Canada, and in\r\nVirginia, these are merely precursors of those of the Upper Cretaceous,\r\nand are not sufficient to redeem the earlier Cretaceous from being a\r\nperiod of pines and cycads.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this early Mesozoic flora, so far as known to us, has a\r\nmonotonous and mean appearance. It no doubt formed vast forests of tall\r\npines, perhaps resembling the giant Sequoias of California; but they must\r\nfor the most part have been dark and dismal woods, probably tenanted by\r\nfew forms of life, for the great reptiles of this age must have preferred\r\nthe open and sunny coasts, and many of them dwelt in the waters. Still\r\nwe must not be too sure of this. The berries and nuts of the numerous\r\nyews and cycads were capable of affording much food. We know that in\r\nthis age there were many great herbivorous reptiles, like _Iguanodon_\r\nand _Hadrosaurus_, some of them fitted by their structure to feed upon\r\nthe leaves and fruits of trees. There were also several kinds of small\r\nherbivorous mammals, and much insect life, and it is likely that few of\r\nthe inhabitants of the Mesozoic woods have been preserved as fossils.\r\nWe may yet have much to learn of the inhabitants of these forests of\r\nferns, cycads, and pines. We must not forget in this connection that in\r\nthe present day there are large islands, like New Zealand, destitute of\r\nmammalia, and having a flora comparable with that of the Mesozoic in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, though more varied. We have also the remarkable\r\nexample of Australia, with a much richer flora than that of the early\r\nMesozoic, yet inhabited only by non-placental mammals, like those of the\r\nMesozoic.\r\n\r\nThe principal legacy that the Mesozoic woods have handed down to our\r\ntime is in some beds of coal, locally important, but of far less extent\r\nthan those of the Carboniferous period. Still, in America, the Richmond\r\ncoal-field in Virginia is of this age, and so are the anthracite beds of\r\nthe Queen Charlotte Islands, on the west coast of Canada, and the coal\r\nof Brora in Sutherlandshire. Valuable beds of coal, probably of this\r\nage, also exist in China, India, and South Africa; and jet, which is so\r\nextensively used for ornament, is principally derived from the carbonised\r\nremains of the old Mesozoic pines.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we have to study a revolution in vegetable life most\r\nstriking and unique, in the advent of the forest-trees of strictly modern\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nI append to this chapter a table showing the plant-bearing series of the\r\nCretaceous and Laramie of North America, from a paper in \"Trans.

Cretaceous, of\r\nGreenland. One of the oldest known Angiosperms.]\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact in geological chronology that the culmination\r\nof the vegetable kingdom antedates that of the animal. The placental\r\nmammals, the highest group of the animal kingdom, are not known till the\r\nbeginning of the Eocene Tertiary. The dicotyledonous Angiosperms, which\r\ncorrespond to them in the vegetable kingdom, occur far earlier--in the\r\nbeginning of the Upper Cretaceous or close of the Lower Cretaceous. The\r\nreign of cycads and pines holds throughout the Lower Cretaceous, but at\r\nthe close of that age there is a sudden incoming of the higher plants,\r\nand a proportionate decrease, more especially of the cycads.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the angiospermous wood supposed to be\r\nDevonian, but I fear to rest any conclusion on this isolated fact.\r\nBeyond this, the earliest indications of plants of this class have\r\nbeen found in the Lower Cretaceous. Many years ago Heer described and\r\nfigured the leaves of a poplar (_Populus primæva_) from the supposed\r\nLower Cretaceous of Komé, in Greenland (Fig. 68). Two species, a\r\n_Sterculia_ and a _Laurus_ or _Salix_, occur among fossils described by\r\nme in the upper part of the Kootanie series of the Rocky Mountains, and\r\nFontaine has recently found in the Potomac group of Virginia--believed\r\nto be of Neocomian age--several angiospermous species (_Sassafras_,\r\n_Menispermites_, _Sapindus_, _Aralia_, _Populus_, &c.) mixed with a rich\r\nflora of cycads and pines. These are the early forerunners of the modern\r\nangiospermous flora; but so far as known they do not occur below the\r\nCretaceous, and in its lower portions only very rarely. When, however, we\r\nascend into the Upper Cretaceous, whether of Europe or America, there is\r\na remarkable incoming of the higher plants, under generic forms similar\r\nto those now existing. This is, in truth, the advent of the modern flora\r\nof the temperate regions of the earth. A very interesting tabular view\r\nof its early distribution is given by Ward, in the \"American Journal of\r\nScience\" for 1884, of which the following is a synopsis, with slight\r\nemendations. I may add that the new discoveries made since 1884 would\r\nprobably tend to increase the proportionate number of dicotyledons in the\r\nnewer groups.\r\n\r\nDicotyledonous Trees in the Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n  _Upper Senonian_                             179 species.\r\n      (Fox Hill group of America.)\r\n\r\n  _Lower Senonian_                              81 species.\r\n      Upper white chalk of Europe; Fort Pierre\r\n        group of America; coal-measures of Nanaimo?\r\n\r\n  _Turonian_                                    20 species.\r\n      Lower white chalk; New Jersey marls;\r\n        Belly R. group.\r\n\r\n  _Cenomanian._                                357 species.\r\n      (Chalk-marl, greensand, and Gault, Niobrara\r\n        and Dakota groups of America); Dunvegan\r\n        group of Canada; Amboy clays of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n  _Neocomian_                                   20 species.[DK]\r\n      (Lower greensand and Speeton clay, Wealden\r\n        and Hastings sands, Kootanie and Queen\r\n        Charlotte groups of Canada.)\r\n\r\n[DK] Including an estimate of Fontaine's undescribed species.\r\n\r\nThus we have a great and sudden inswarming of the higher plants of\r\nmodern types at the close of the Lower Cretaceous. In relation to this,\r\nSaporta, one of the most enthusiastic of evolutionists, is struck by\r\nthis phenomenon of the sudden appearance of so many forms, and some of\r\nthem the most highly differentiated of dicotyledonous plants. The early\r\nstages of their evolution may, he thinks, have been obscure and as yet\r\nunobserved, or they may have taken place in some separate region, or\r\nmother country as yet undiscovered, or they may have been produced by\r\na rapid and unusual multiplication of flower-haunting insects! Or it\r\nis even conceivable that the apparently sudden elevation of plants may\r\nhave been due to causes still unknown. This last seems, indeed, the only\r\ncertain inference in the case, since, as Saporta proceeds to say in\r\nconclusion: \"Whatever hypothesis one may prefer, the fact of the rapid\r\nmultiplication of dicotyledons, and of their simultaneous appearance in a\r\ngreat number of places in the northern hemisphere at the beginning of the\r\nCenomanian epoch, cannot be disputed.\"[DL]\r\n\r\n[DL] \"Monde des Plantes,\" p. 197.\r\n\r\nThe leaves described by Heer, from the Middle Cretaceous of Greenland,\r\nare those of a poplar (_P. primæva_). Those which I have described from\r\na corresponding horizon in the Rocky Mountains are a _Sterculites_ (_S.\r\nvetustula_), probably allied to the mallows, and an elongated leaf,\r\n_Laurophyllum_ (_L. crassinerve_) (Fig. 69), which may, however, have\r\nbelonged to a willow rather than a laurel. These are certainly older than\r\nthe Dakota group of the United States and the corresponding formations\r\nin Canada. On the eastern side of the American continent, in Virginia,\r\nthe Potomac series is supposed to be of Lower Cretaceous age, and here\r\nFontaine, as already stated, has found an abundant flora of cycads,\r\nconifers, and ferns, with a few angiospermous leaves, which have not yet\r\nbeen described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--_Stercalia_ and _Laurophyllum_ or Salix, the\r\noldest Angiosperms Known in the Cretaceous of Canada.]\r\n\r\nIn the Canadian Rocky Mountains, a few hundreds of feet above the beds\r\nholding the beforementioned species, are the shales of the Mill Creek\r\nseries, rich in many species of dicotyledonous leaves, and corresponding\r\nin age with the Dakota group, whose fossils have been so well described,\r\nfirst by Heer and Capellini, and afterward by Lesquereux. We may take\r\nthis Dakota group and the quader-sand stone of Germany as types of the\r\nplant-bearing Cenomanian, and may notice the forms occurring in them.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we recognise here the successors of our old friends,\r\nthe ferns and the pines, the latter represented by such genera as\r\n_Taxites_, _Sequoia_, _Glyptostrobus_, _Gingko_, and even _Pinus_ itself.\r\nWe also have a few cycads, but not so dominant as in the previous\r\nages. The fan-palms are well represented, both in America and in the\r\ncorresponding series in Europe, especially by the genus _Sabal_, which\r\nis the characteristic American type of fan-palm, and there is one genus\r\nwhich Saporta regards as intermediate between the fan-palms and the\r\npinnately leaved species. There are also many fragments of stems and\r\nleaves of carices and grasses, so that these plants, now so important\r\nto the nourishment of man and his companion animals, were already\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Vegetation of Later Cretaceous. Exogens and\r\npalms. (After Saporta.)]\r\n\r\nBut the great feature of the time was its dicotyledonous forests, and I\r\nhave only to enumerate the genera supposed to be represented in order\r\nto show the richness of the time in plants of this type. It may be\r\nnecessary to explain here that the generic names used are mostly based\r\non leaves, and consequently cannot be held as being absolutely certain,\r\nsince we know that at present one genus may have considerable variety\r\nin its leaves, and, on the other hand, that plants of different genera\r\nmay be very much alike in their foliage. There is, however, undoubtedly\r\na likeness in plan or type of structure in leaves of closely allied\r\nplants, and, therefore, if judiciously studied, they can be determined\r\nwith at least approximate certainty.[DM] More especially we can attain\r\nto much certainty when the fruits as well as the leaves are found,\r\nand when we can obtain specimens of the wood, showing its structure.\r\nSuch corroboration is not wanting, though unfortunately the leaves\r\nof trees are generally found drifted away from the other organs once\r\nconnected with them. In my own experience, however, I have often found\r\ndeterminations of the leaves of trees confirmed by the discovery of their\r\nfruits or of the structure of their stems. Thus, in the rich cretaceous\r\nplant-beds of the Dunvegan series we have beech-nuts associated in\r\nthe same beds with leaves referred to _Fagus_. In the Laramie beds I\r\ndetermined many years ago nuts of the _Trapa_ or water-chestnut, and\r\nsubsequently Lesquereux found, in beds in the United States, leaves which\r\nhe referred to the same genus. Later, I found in collections made on the\r\nRed Deer River of Canada my fruits and Lesquereux's leaves on the same\r\nslab. The presence of trees of the genera _Carya_ and _Juglans_ in the\r\nsame formation was inferred from their leaves, and specimens have since\r\nbeen obtained of silicified wood, with the microscopic structure of the\r\nmodern butternut. Still we are willing to admit that determinations from\r\nleaves alone are liable to doubt.\r\n\r\n[DM] Great allowance has to be made for the variability of leaves of the\r\nsame species. The modern hazel (_C. rostrata_) is a case in point. Its\r\nleaves, from different parts of the same plant, are so dissimilar in form\r\nand size that they might readily be regarded as of different species.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of names of fossil leaves, I sympathise very strongly\r\nwith Dr. Nathorst, of Stockholm, in his objection to the use of modern\r\ngeneric names for mere leaves, and would be quite content to adopt some\r\nnon-committal termination, as that of \"_phyllum_\" or \"_ites_\" suggested\r\nby him. I feel, however, that almost as much is taken for granted if a\r\nplant is called Corylophyllum or _Corylites_, as if called _Corylus_. In\r\neither case a judgment is expressed as to its affinities, which if wrong\r\nunder the one term is wrong under the other; and after so much has been\r\ndone by so many eminent botanists, it seems inexpedient to change the\r\nwhole nomenclature for so small and questionable an advantage. I wish\r\nit, however, to be distinctly understood that plants catalogued on the\r\nevidence of leaves alone are for the most part referred to certain genera\r\non grounds necessarily imperfect, and their names are therefore subject\r\nto correction, as new facts may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe more noteworthy modern genera included in the Dakota flora, as\r\ncatalogued by Lesquereux, are the following: _Liquidambar_, the\r\nsweet-gum, is represented both in America and Europe, the leaves\r\nresembling those of the modern species, but with entire edges, which\r\nseems to be a common peculiarity of Cretaceous foliage.[DN] _Populus_\r\n(poplar), as already stated, appears very early in Greenland, and\r\ncontinues with increasing number of species throughout the Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary. _Salix_ (willow) appears only a little later and continues. Of\r\nthe family _Cupuliferæ_ we have _Fagus_ (beech), _Quercus_ (oak), and\r\n_Castanea_ (chestnut), which appear together in the Dakota group and\r\nits equivalents. Fruits of some of the species are known, and also wood\r\nshowing structure. _Betula_ (birch) is represented by a few species,\r\nand specimens of its peculiar bark are also common. _Alnus_ (alder)\r\nappears in one species at least. The genus Plat anus (Fig. 71), that of\r\nthe plane-trees, represented at present by one European and one American\r\nspecies, has several species in the Cretaceous, though the plane-trees\r\nseem to culminate in the early part of the succeeding Eocene, where\r\nthere are several species with immense leaves. The large leaves,\r\nknown as _Credneria_, found in the Cenomanian of Europe, and those\r\ncalled _Protophyllum_ (Fig. 72) in America, appear to be nearer to the\r\nplane-trees than to any others, though representing an extinct type. The\r\nlaurels are represented in this age, and the American genus Sassafras,\r\nwhich has now only one species, has not one merely but several species in\r\nthe Cretaceous. _Diospyros_, the persimmon-tree, was also a Cretaceous\r\ngenus.\r\n\r\n[DN] With reference to this, something may be learned from the leaves\r\nof modern trees. In these, young shoots have leaves often less toothed\r\nand serrated than those of the adult tree. A remarkable instance is the\r\n_Populus grandidentatus_ of America, the young shoots of which have\r\nentire leaves, quite unlike except in venation those of the parent tree,\r\nand having an aspect very similar to that of the Cretaceous poplars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--_Platanus nobilis_, Newberry, variety\r\n_basilobata_. Laramie. Much reduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--_Protophyllum boreale_, Dawson, reduced. Upper\r\nCretaceous, Canada.]\r\n\r\nThe single species of the beautiful _Liriodendron_, or tulip-tree, is\r\na remnant of a genus which had several Cretaceous species (Figs. 74,\r\n75). The magnolias, still well represented in the American flora, were\r\nequally plentiful in the Cretaceous (Fig. 73). The walnut family were\r\nwell represented by species of _Juglans_ (butternut) and _Carya_, or\r\nhickory. In all, no less than forty-eight genera are present belonging\r\nto at least twenty-five families, running through the whole range of the\r\ndicotyledonous exogens. This is a remarkable result, indicating a sudden\r\nprofusion of forms of these plants of a very striking character. It is\r\nfurther to be observed that some of the genera have many species in the\r\nCretaceous and dwindle toward the modern. In others the reverse is the\r\ncase--they have expanded in modern times. In a number there seems to have\r\nbeen little change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--_Magnolia magnifica_, Dawson, reduced. Upper\r\nCretaceous, Canada.]\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry has given, in the \"Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club\" an\r\ninteresting _résumé_ of the history of the beautiful _Liriodendron_, or\r\ntulip-tree, which may be taken as an example of a genus which has gone\r\ndown in importance in the course of its geological history.\r\n\r\n\"The genus _Liriodendron_, as all botanists know, is represented in the\r\npresent flora by a single species, 'the tulip-tree' which is confined\r\nto eastern America, but grows over all the area lying between the Lakes\r\nand the Gulf, the Mississippi and the Atlantic. It is a magnificent\r\ntree, on the whole, the finest in our forests. Its cylindrical trunk,\r\nsometimes ten feet in diameter, carries it beyond all its associates in\r\nsize, while the beauty of its glossy, lyre-shaped leaves and tulip-like\r\nflowers is only surpassed by the flowers and foliage of its first cousin,\r\n_Magnolia grandiflora_. That a plant so splendid should stand quite alone\r\nin the vegetation of the present day excited the wonder of the earlier\r\nbotanists, but the sassafras, the sweet-gum, and the great Sequoias of\r\nthe far West afford similar examples of isolation, and the latter are\r\nstill more striking illustrations of solitary grandeur.\" (Figs. 74 and\r\n75.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--_Liriodendron Meekii_, Heer. (After Lesquereux.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--_Liriodendron primævum_, Newberry. (After\r\nNewberry.)]\r\n\r\n\"Three species of _Liriodendron_ are indicated by leaves found in the\r\nAmboy clays--Middle Cretaceous--of New Jersey, and others have been\r\nobtained from the Dakota group in the West, and from the Upper Cretaceous\r\nstrata of Greenland. Though differing considerably among themselves in\r\nsize and form, all these have the deep sinus of the upper extremity\r\nso characteristic of the genus, and the nervation is also essentially\r\nthe same. Hence, we must conclude that the genus _Liriodendron_, now\r\nrepresented by a single species, was in the Cretaceous age much more\r\nlargely developed, having many species, and those scattered throughout\r\nmany lands. In the Tertiary age the genus continued to exist, but\r\nthe species seem to have been reduced to one, which is hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from that now living. In many parts of Europe leaves of\r\nthe tulip-tree have been found, and it extended as far south as Italy.\r\nIts presence there was first made known by Unger, in his 'Synopsis,'\r\npage 232, and in his 'Genera et Species,' page 443, where he describes\r\nit under the name of _Liriodendron procaccinii_. The genus has also been\r\nnoticed in Europe by Massalongo, Heer, and Ettingshausen, and three\r\nspecies have been distinguished. All these are, however, so much like the\r\nliving species that they should probably be united with it. We here have\r\na striking illustration of the wide distribution of a species which has\r\nretained its characters both of fruit and leaf quite unchanged through\r\nlong migrations and an enormous lapse of time.\r\n\r\n\"In Europe the tulip-tree, like many of its American associates, seems\r\nto have been destroyed by the cold of the Ice period, the Mediterranean\r\ncutting off its retreat, but in America it migrated southward over the\r\nsouthern extension of the continent and returned northward again with the\r\namelioration of the climate.\"\r\n\r\nLeaves of _Liriodendron_ have been recognised in the Cretaceous of\r\nGreenland, though it is now a tree of the warm temperate region, and\r\nLesquereux describes several species from the Dakota group. But the genus\r\nhas not yet been recognised in the Laramie or in the Upper Cretaceous of\r\nBritish Columbia. In the paper above quoted, Newberry describes three new\r\nspecies from the Amboy clays, one of which he considers identical with a\r\nGreenland form referred by Heer to _L. Meekii_ of the Dakota group. Thus,\r\nif all Lesquereux's species are to be accepted, the genus begins in the\r\nMiddle Cretaceous with at least nine American species.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey the Amboy clays are referred to the same age with the\r\nDakota beds of the West. In these Dr. Newberry has found a rich flora,\r\nincluding many angiosperms. The following is condensed from a preliminary\r\nnotice in the \"Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club\":[DO]\r\n\r\n[DO] March, 1886.\r\n\r\n\"The flora of the Amboy clays is closely related to that of the Dakota\r\ngroup--most of the genera and some of the species being identical--so\r\nthat we may conclude they were nearly contemporaneous, though the absence\r\nin New Jersey of the Fort Benton and Niobrara groups of the upper\r\nMissouri and the apparent synchronism of the New Jersey marls and the\r\nPierre group indicate that the Dakota is a little the older.\r\n\r\n\"At least one-third of the species of the Amboy clays seem to be\r\nidentical with leaves found in the Upper Cretaceous clays of Greenland\r\nand Aachen (Aix la Chapelle), which not only indicates a chronological\r\nparallelism, but shows a remarkable and unexpected similarity in the\r\nvegetation of these widely separated countries in the middle and last\r\nhalf of the Cretaceous age. The botanical character of the flora of the\r\nAmboy clays will be seen from the following brief synopsis:\r\n\r\n\"_Algæ._--A small and delicate form, allied to Chondrites.\r\n\r\n\"_Ferns._--Twelve species, generally similar and in part identical with\r\nthose described by Heer from the Cretaceous beds of Greenland, and\r\nreferred to the genera _Dicksonia_, _Gleichenia_, and _Aspidium_.\r\n\r\n\"_Cycads._--Two species, probably identical with the forms from Greenland\r\ndescribed by Heer under the names of _Podozamites marginatus_ and _P.\r\ntenuinervis_.\r\n\r\n\"_Conifers._--Fourteen species, belonging to the genera _Moriconia_,\r\n_Brachyphyllum_, _Cunninghamites_, _Pinus_, _Sequoia_, and others\r\nreferred by Heer to _Juniperus_, _Libocedrus_, _Frenelopsis_, _Thuya_,\r\nand _Dammara_. Of these, the most abundant and most interesting\r\nare _Moriconia cyclotoxon_--the most beautiful of conifers--and\r\n_Cunninghamites elegans_, both of which occur in the Cretaceous clays of\r\nAachen, Prussia, and Patoot, Greenland. The _Brachyphyllum_ was a large\r\nand strong species, with imbricated cones, eight inches in length.\r\n\r\n\"The angiosperms form about seventy species, which include three of\r\n_Magnolia_, four of _Liriodendron_, three or four of _Salix_, three of\r\n_Celastrophyllum_ (of which one is identical with a Greenland species),\r\none _Celastrus_ (also found in Greenland), four or five _Aralias_,\r\ntwo _Sassafras_, one _Cinnamomum_, one _Hedera_; with leaves that\r\nare apparently identical with those described by Heer as belonging\r\nto _Andromeda_, _Cissites_, _Cornus_, _Dewalquea_, _Diospyros_,\r\n_Eucalyptus_, _Ficus_, _Ilex_, _Juglans_, _Laurus_, _Menispermites_,\r\n_Myrica_, _Myrsine_, _Prunus_, _Rhamnus_, and others not yet determined.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the Aralias had palmately-lobed leaves, nearly a foot in\r\ndiameter, and two of the tulip-trees (_Liriodendron_) had leaves quite\r\nas large as those of the living species. One of these had deeply lobed\r\nleaves, like those of the white oak. Of the other, the leaves resembled\r\nthose of the recent tulip-tree, but were larger. Both had the peculiar\r\nemargination and the nervation of _Liriodendron_.\r\n\r\n\"Among the most interesting plants of the collection are fine species of\r\n_Bauhinia_ and _Hymenæa_. Of these, the first is represented by a large\r\nnumber of leaves, some of which are six or seven inches in diameter.\r\nThey are deeply bilobed, and have the peculiar and characteristic form\r\nand nervation of the leaves of this genus. _Bauhinia_ is a leguminous\r\ngenus allied to _Cercis_, and now inhabits tropical and warm temperate\r\nclimates in both hemispheres. Only one species occurs in the United\r\nStates, _Bauhinia lunarioides_, Gray, found by Dr. Bigelow on the Rio\r\nGrande.\r\n\r\n\"_Hymenæa_ is another of the leguminosæ, and inhabits tropical America. A\r\nspecies of this genus has been found in the Upper Cretaceous of France,\r\nbut quite different from the one before us, in which the leaves are much\r\nlarger, and the leaflets are united in a common petiole, which is winged;\r\nthis is a modification not found in the living species, and one which\r\nbrings it nearer to _Bauhinia_.\r\n\r\n\"But the most surprising discovery yet made is that of a number of quite\r\nlarge helianthoid flowers, which I have called _Palæanthus_. These\r\nare three to four inches in diameter, and exhibit a scaly involucre,\r\nenclosing what much resembles a fleshy receptacle with achenia. From\r\nthe border of this radiate a number of ray florets, one to two inches\r\nin length, which are persistent and must have been scarious, like\r\nthose of _Helichrysum_. Though these flowers so much resemble those\r\nof the compositæ, we are not yet warranted in asserting that such is\r\ncertainly their character. In the Jurassic rocks of Europe and India\r\nsome flowers not very unlike these have been found, which have been\r\nnamed _Williamsonia_, and referred to cycads by Carruthers. A similar\r\nfossil has been found in the Cretaceous rocks of Greenland, and named\r\nby Heer _Williamsonia cretacea_, but he questions the reference of the\r\ngenus to the Cycadeæ, and agrees with Nathorst in considering all the\r\nspecies of _Williamsonia_ as parasitic flowers, allied to _Brugmansia_\r\nor _Rafflesia_. The Marquis of Saporta regards them as monocotyledons,\r\nsimilar to _Pandanus_. More specimens of the flowers now exhibited\r\nwill perhaps prove--what we can now only regard as probable--that the\r\nCompositæ, like the _Leguminosæ_, _Magnoliaceæ_, _Celastraceæ_, and\r\nother highly organised plants, formed part of the Cretaceous flora. No\r\ncomposite flowers have before been found in the fossil state, and, as\r\nthese are among the most complex and specialised forms of florescence, it\r\nhas been supposed that they belonged only to the recent epoch, where they\r\nwere the result of a long series of formative changes.\"\r\n\r\nThe above presents some interesting new types not heretofore found in the\r\nMiddle Cretaceous. More especially the occurrence of large flowers of the\r\ncomposite type presents a startling illustration of the early appearance\r\nof a very elevated and complex form. Great interest also attaches to\r\nthese Amboy beds, as serving, with those of Aix and Greenland, to show\r\nthat the margins of the Atlantic were occupied with a flora similar to\r\nthat occurring at the same time in the interior plateau of North America\r\nand on the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nThe beds at Aix-la-Chapelle are, however, probably somewhat newer than\r\nthe Dakota or Amboy beds, and correspond more nearly in age with those\r\nof the Cretaceous coal-field of Vancouver Island, where there is a\r\nvery rich Upper Cretaceous flora, which I have noticed in detail in\r\nthe \"Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada.\"[DP] In these Upper\r\nCretaceous beds there are fan-palms as far north at least as the latitude\r\nof 49°, indicating a very mild climate at this period. This inference\r\nis corroborated by the Upper Cretaceous flora of Atané and Patoot in\r\nGreenland, as described by Heer.\r\n\r\n[DP] Vol. ii., 1884.\r\n\r\nThe dicotyledonous plants above referred to are trees and shrubs. Of the\r\nherbaceous exogens of the period we know less. Obviously their leaves\r\nare less likely to find their way into aqueous deposits than the leaves\r\nof trees. They are, besides, more perishable, and in densely wooded\r\ncountries there are comparatively few herbaceous plants. I have examined\r\nthe beds of mud deposited at the mouth of a woodland streamlet, and have\r\nfound them stored with the fallen leaves of trees, but it was in vain to\r\nsearch for the leaves of herbaceous plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--_Brasenia antiqua_. Upper Cretaceous, South\r\nSaskatchewan River. Natural size, _a_, _b_, Diagrams of venation,\r\nslightly enlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe climate of North America and Europe, represented by the Cenomanian\r\nvegetation, is not tropical but warm temperate; but the flora was more\r\nuniform than at present, indicating a very equable climate and the\r\npossibility of temperate genera existing within the Arctic circle, and it\r\nwould seem to have become warmer toward the close of the period.\r\n\r\nThe flora of the Cenomanian is separated in most countries from that of\r\nthe Senonian, or uppermost Cretaceous, by a marine formation holding few\r\nplants. This depends on great movements of elevation and depression, to\r\nwhich we must refer in the sequel. In a few regions, however, as in the\r\nvicinity of the Peace River in Canada, there are plant-bearing beds which\r\nserve to bridge over the interval between the Early Cenomanian and the\r\nlater Cretaceous.[DQ]\r\n\r\n[DQ] See paper by the author in the \"Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\nCanada,\" 1882.\r\n\r\nTo this interval also would seem to belong the Belly River series of\r\nwestern Canada, which contains important beds of Coal, but is Closely\r\nassociated with the marine Fort Pierre series. A very curious herbaceous\r\nplant of this group, which I have named _Brasenia antiqua_, occurs in the\r\nbeds associated with one of the coals. It is a close ally of the modern\r\n_B. peltata_, an aquatic plant which occurs in British Columbia and in\r\neastern America, and is also said to be found in Japan, Australia, and\r\nIndia, a width of distribution appropriate to so old a type (Fig. 76).\r\n\r\nIn so far as vegetable life is concerned, the transition from the Upper\r\nCretaceous to the Tertiary or Kainozoic is easy, though in many parts\r\nof the world, and more especially in western Europe, there is a great\r\ngap in the deposits between the upper Chalk and the lowest Eocene.\r\nWith reference to fossil plants, Schimper recognises in the Kainozoic,\r\nbeginning with the oldest, five formations--Palæocene, Eocene, Oligocene,\r\nMiocene, and Pliocene. Throughout these a flora, similar to that of the\r\nCretaceous on the one hand and the modern on the other, though with\r\nimportant local peculiarities, extends. There is evidence, however,\r\nof a gradual refrigeration, so that in the Pliocene the climates of\r\nthe northern hemisphere were not markedly different from their present\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance an important error was committed by palæobotanists,\r\nin referring to the Miocene many deposits really belonging to the Eocene.\r\nThis arose from the early study of the rich plant-bearing Miocene beds of\r\nSwitzerland, and from the similarity of the flora all the way from the\r\nMiddle Cretaceous to the later Tertiary. The differences are now being\r\nworked out, and we owe to Mr. Starkie Gardner the credit of pointing\r\nthese out in England, and to the Geological Survey of Canada that of\r\ncollecting the material for exhibiting them in the more northern part of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn the great interior plain of America there rests on the Cretaceous\r\na series of clays and sandstones with beds of lignite, some of them\r\neighteen feet in thickness. This was formerly known as the lignitic or\r\nlignite Tertiary, but more recently as the Laramie series. These beds\r\nwere deposited in fresh or brackish water, in an internal sea or group of\r\nlakes and swamps, when the continent was lower than at present. They have\r\nbeen studied both in the United States[DR] and Canada; and, though their\r\nflora was originally referred by mistake to the Miocene, it is now known\r\nto be Eocene or Palæocene, or even in part a transition group between\r\nthe latter and the Cretaceous. The following remarks, taken chiefly from\r\nrecent papers by the author,[DS] will serve to illustrate this:\r\n\r\n[DR] See more especially the elaborate and valuable reports by Lesquereux\r\nand Newberry, and a recent memoir by Ward on \"Types of the Laramie\r\nFlora,\" \"Bulletins of the United States Geological Survey,\" 1887.\r\n\r\n[DS] \"Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada,\" 1886-'87.\r\n\r\nOn the geological map of Canada the Laramie series, formerly known as\r\nthe lignitic or lignite Tertiary, occurs, with the exception of a few\r\noutliers, in two large areas west of the 100th meridian, and separated\r\nfrom each other by a tract of older Cretaceous rocks, over which the\r\nLaramie beds may have extended, before the later denudation of the region.\r\n\r\nThe most eastern of these areas, that of the Souris River and Wood\r\nMountain, extends for some distance along the United States boundary,\r\nbetween the 102d and 109th meridians, and reaches northward to about\r\nthirty miles south of the \"elbow\" of the South Saskatchewan River, which\r\nis on the parallel of 51° north. In this area the lowest beds of the\r\nLaramie are seen to rest on those of the Fox Hill group of the Upper\r\nCretaceous, and at one point on the west they are overlaid by beds of\r\nMiocene Tertiary age, observed by Mr. McConnell, of the Geological\r\nSurvey, in the Cypress Hills, and referred by Cope, on the evidence of\r\nmammalian remains, to the White River division of the United States\r\ngeologists, which is regarded by them as Lower Miocene.[DT] The age of\r\nthe Laramie beds is thus stratigraphically determined to be between the\r\nFox Hill Cretaceous and the Lower Miocene. They are also undoubtedly\r\ncontinuous with the Fort Union group of the United States geologists on\r\nthe other side of the international boundary, and they contain similar\r\nfossil plants. They are divisible into two groups--a lower, mostly\r\nargillaceous, and to which the name of \"Bad Lands beds\" may be given,\r\nfrom the \"bad lands\" of Wood Mountain, where they are well exposed, and\r\nan upper, partly arenaceous member, which may be named the Souris River\r\nor Porcupine Creek division. In the lower division are found reptilian\r\nremains of Upper Cretaceous type, with some fish remains more nearly\r\nakin to those of the Eocene.[DU] Neither division has as yet afforded\r\nmammalian remains.\r\n\r\n[DT] \"Report of the Geological Survey of Canada,\" 1885.\r\n\r\n[DU] Cope, in Dr. G. M. Dawson's \"Report on the 49th Parallel.\"\r\n\r\nThe western area is of still larger dimensions, and extends along the\r\neastern base of the Rocky Mountains from the United States boundary\r\nto about the 55th parallel of latitude, and stretches eastward to the\r\n111th meridian. In this area, and more especially in its southern part,\r\nthe officers of the Geological Survey of Canada have recognised three\r\ndivisions, as follows: (1) The Lower Laramie or St. Mary River series,\r\ncorresponding in its character and fossils to the Lower or Bad Lands\r\ndivision of the other area. (2) A middle division, the Willow Creek beds,\r\nconsisting of clays, mostly reddish, and not recognised in the other\r\narea. (3) The Upper Laramie or Porcupine Hills division, corresponding\r\nin fossils, and to some extent in mineral character, to the Souris River\r\nbeds of the eastern area.\r\n\r\nThe fossil plants collected by Dr. G. M. Dawson in the eastern area were\r\nnoticed by the author in an appendix to Dr. Dawson's report on the 49th\r\nparallel, in 1875, and a collection subsequently made by Dr. Selwyn\r\nwas described in the \"Report of the Geological Survey of Canada\" for\r\n1879-'80. Those of the western area, and especially collections made by\r\nmyself near Calgary in 1883, and by officers of the Geological Survey in\r\n1884, have been described in the \"Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\nCanada\" vols. iii. and iv.\r\n\r\nIn studying these fossil plants, I have found that there is a close\r\ncorrespondence between those of the Lower and Upper Laramie in the two\r\nareas above referred to respectively, and that the flora of the Lower\r\nLaramie is somewhat distinct from that of the Upper, the former being\r\nespecially rich in certain aquatic plants, and the latter much more\r\ncopious on the whole, and much more rich in remains of forest-trees. This\r\nis, however, possibly an effect rather of local conditions than of any\r\nconsiderable change in the flora, since some Upper Laramie forms recur\r\nas low as the Belly River series of the Cretaceous, which is believed on\r\nstratigraphical grounds to be considerably older than the Lower Laramie.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the correlation of these beds with those of the United\r\nStates, some difficulty has arisen from the tendency of palæobotanists\r\nto refer the plants of the Upper Laramie to the Miocene age, although\r\nin the reports of Mr. Clarence King, the late director of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, these beds are classed, on the evidence of\r\nstratigraphy and animal fossils, as Upper Cretaceous. More recently,\r\nhowever, and partly perhaps in consequence of the views maintained by the\r\nwriter since 1875, some change of opinion has occurred, and Dr. Newberry\r\nand Mr. Lesquereux seem now inclined to admit that what in Canada we\r\nrecognise as Upper Laramie is really Eocene, and the Lower Laramie\r\neither Cretaceous or a transition group between this and the Eocene. In\r\na recent paper [DV] Dr. Newberry gives a comparative table, in which he\r\ncorrelates the Lower Laramie with the Upper Cretaceous of Vancouver\r\nIsland and the Faxoe and Maestricht beds of Europe, while he regards the\r\nUpper Laramie as equivalent to European Eocene. Except in so far as the\r\nequivalence of the Lower Laramie and Vancouver Island beds is concerned,\r\nthis corresponds very nearly with the conclusions of the writer in a\r\npaper published last year[DW]--namely, that we must either regard the\r\nLaramie as a transition Cretaceo-Eocene group, or must institute our\r\nline of separation in the Willow Creek or Middle Laramie division, which\r\nhas, however, as yet afforded no fossil plants. I doubt, however, the\r\nequivalence of the Vancouver beds and the Lower Laramie, except perhaps\r\nin so far as the upper member of the former is concerned. I have also to\r\nobserve that in the latest report of Mr. Lesquereux he still seems to\r\nretain in the Miocene certain formations in the West, which from their\r\nfossil plants I should be inclined to regard as Eocene.[DX]\r\n\r\n[DV] Newberry, \"Transactions of the New Fork Academy,\" February, 1886.\r\n\r\n[DW] \"Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada,\" vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[DX] While these sheets were going through the press I received a very\r\nvaluable report of Mr. Lester F. Ward upon the Laramie of the United\r\nStates. I have merely had time to glance at this report, but can see that\r\nthe views of the author agree closely with those above expressed.\r\n\r\nTwo ferns occurring in these beds are remarkable as evidence of the\r\npersistence of species, and of the peculiarities of their ancient and\r\nmodern distribution. _Onoclea sensibilis_, the very common sensitive\r\nfern of eastern America, is extremely abundant in the Laramie beds over\r\na great area in the West. Mr. Starkie Gardner and Dr. Newberry have also\r\nshown that it is identical with the _Filicites Hebridicus_ of Forbes,\r\nfrom the early Eocene beds of the Island of Mull, in Scotland. Thus we\r\nhave a species once common to Europe and America, but now restricted\r\nto the latter, and which has continued to exist over all the vast ages\r\nbetween the Cretaceous and the present day. In the Laramie beds I have\r\nfound associated with this species another and more delicate fern,\r\nthe modern _Davallia_ (_Stenloma_) _tenuifolia_, but this, unlike its\r\ncompanion, no longer occurs in America, but is found in the mountains of\r\nAsia. This is a curious illustration of the fact that frail and delicate\r\nplants may be more ancient than the mountains or plains on which they\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThere are also some very interesting and curious facts in connection with\r\nthe conifers of the Laramie. One of the most common of these is a _Thuja_\r\nor arbor vitæ (the so-called \"cedar\" of Canada). The Laramie species has\r\nbeen named _T. interrupta_ by Newberry, but it approaches very closely\r\nin its foliage to _T. occidentalis_, of eastern Canada, while its fruit\r\nresembles that of the western species, _T. gigantea_.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable are the Sequoias to which we have already referred,\r\nbut which in the Laramie age seem to have been spread over nearly\r\nall North America. The fossil species are of two types, representing\r\nrespectively the modern _S. gigantea_ and _S. sempervirens_, and their\r\nwood, as well as that of Thuja, is found in great abundance in the\r\nlignites, and also in the form of silicified trunks, and corresponds\r\nwith that of the recent species. The Laramie contains also conifers\r\nof the genera _Glyptostrobus_, _Taxodium_, and _Taxus_; and the\r\ngenus _Salisburia_ or gingko--so characteristic of the Jurassic and\r\nCretaceous--is still represented in America as well as in Europe in the\r\nearly Eocene.\r\n\r\nWe have no palms in the Canadian or Scottish Palæocene, though I\r\nbelieve they are found further south. The dicotyledonous trees are\r\nrichly represented. Perhaps the most conspicuous were three species of\r\n_Platanus_, the leaves of which sometimes fill the sandstones, and one\r\nof which, _P. nobilis_, Newberry, sometimes attains the gigantic size of\r\na foot or more in diameter of its blade. The hazels are represented by a\r\nlarge-leaved species, _C. Macquarrii_, and by leaves not distinguishable\r\nfrom those of the modern American species, _C. Americana_ and _C.\r\nrostrata_. There are also chestnuts and oaks. But the poplars and willows\r\nare specially abundant, being represented by no less than six species,\r\nand it would seem that all the modern types of poplar, as indicated by\r\nthe forms and venation of the leaves, existed already in the Laramie, and\r\nmost of them even in the Upper Cretaceous. _Sassafras_ is represented by\r\ntwo species, and the beautiful group of _Viburnum_,, to which the modern\r\ntree-cranberry belongs, has several fine species, of some of which both\r\nleaves and berries have been found. The hickories and butternuts are\r\nalso present, the horse-chestnut, the _Catalpa_ and _Sapindus_, and some\r\ncurious leaves which seem to indicate the presence of the modern genus\r\n_Symphorocarpus_, the snow-berry tribe.\r\n\r\nThe above may suffice to give an idea of the flora of the older Eocene\r\nin North America, and I may refer for details to the works of Newberry,\r\nLesquereux, and Ward, already cited. I must now add that the so-called\r\nMiocene of Atanekerdluk, Greenland, is really of the same age, as also\r\nthe \"Miocene\" of Mull, in Scotland, of Antrim, in Ireland, and of Bovey\r\nTracey, in the south of England, and the Gelinden, or \"Heersian\" beds,\r\nof Belgium, described by Saporta. In comparing the American specimens\r\nwith the descriptions given by Gardner of the leaf-beds at Ardtown, in\r\nMull, we find, as already stated, _Onoclea sensibilis_, common to both.\r\nThe species of _Sequoia_, _Gingko_, _Taxus_, and _Glyptostrobus_ are\r\nalso identical or closely allied, and so are many of the dicotyledonous\r\nleaves. For example, _Platanoides Hebridicus_ is very near to _P.\r\nnobilis_, and _Corylus Macquarrii_ is common to both formations, as well\r\nas _Populus Arctica_ and _P. Richardsoni_. I may add that ever since\r\n1875-'76, when I first studied the Laramie plants, I have maintained\r\ntheir identity with those of the Fort Union group of the United States,\r\nand of the so-called Miocene of McKenzie River and Greenland, and that\r\nthe whole are Paleocene; and this conclusion has now been confirmed by\r\nthe researches of Gardner in England, and by the discovery of true Lower\r\nMiocene beds in the Canadian northwest, overlying the Laramie or lignite\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nIn a bulletin of the United States Geological Survey (1886), Dr. White\r\nhas established in the West the continuous stratigraphical succession of\r\nthe Laramie and the Wahsatch Eocene, thus placing the Laramie conformably\r\nbelow the Lower Eocene of that region. Cope has also described as the\r\nPuerta group a series of beds holding vertebrate fossils, and forming a\r\ntransition from the Laramie to the Wahsatch. White also testifies that\r\na number of fresh-water mollusks are common to the Wahsatch and the\r\nLaramie. This finally settles the position of the Laramie so far as the\r\nUnited States geologists are concerned, and shows that the flora is to be\r\nregarded as Eocene if not Upper Cretaceous, in harmony with what has been\r\nall along maintained in Canada. An important _résumé_ of the flora has\r\njust been issued by Ward in the bulletins of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey (1887).\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this part of the subject, I would deprecate the remark,\r\nwhich I see occasionally made, that fossil plants are of little value in\r\ndetermining geological horizons in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. I admit\r\nthat in these periods some allowance must be made for local differences\r\nof station, and also that there is a generic sameness in the flora of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, from the Cenomanian to the modern, yet these local\r\ndifferences and general similarity are not of a nature to invalidate\r\ninferences as to age. No doubt, so long as palæobotanists seemed obliged,\r\nin deference to authority, and to the results of investigations limited\r\nto a few European localities, to group together, without distinction, all\r\nthe floras of the later Cretaceous and earlier Tertiary, irrespective\r\nof stratigraphical considerations, the subject lost its geological\r\nimportance. But, when a good series has been obtained in any one region\r\nof some extent, the case becomes different. Though there is still much\r\nimperfection in our knowledge of the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras\r\nof Canada, I think the work already done is sufficient to enable any\r\ncompetent observer to distinguish by their fossil plants the Lower,\r\nMiddle, and Upper Cretaceous, and the latter from the Tertiary; and, with\r\nthe aid of the work already done by Lesquereux and Newberry in the United\r\nStates, to refer approximately to its true geological position any group\r\nof plants from beds of unknown age in the West.\r\n\r\nAn important consequence arising from the above statements is that\r\nthe period of warm climate which enabled a temperate flora to exist\r\nin Greenland was that of the later Cretaceous and early Eocene rather\r\nthan, as usually stated, the Miocene. It is also a question admitting of\r\ndiscussion whether the Eocene flora of latitudes so different as those of\r\nGreenland, Mackenzie River, northwest Canada, and the United States, were\r\nstrictly contemporaneous, or successive within a long geological period\r\nin which climatal changes were gradually proceeding. The latter statement\r\nmust apply at least to the beginning and close of the period; but the\r\nplants themselves have something to say in favour of contemporaneity. The\r\nflora of the Laramie is not a tropical but a temperate flora, showing no\r\ndoubt that a much more equable climate prevailed in the more northern\r\nparts of America than at present. But this equability of climate implies\r\nthe possibility of a great geographical range on the part of plants.\r\nThus it is quite possible and indeed highly probable that in the Laramie\r\nage a somewhat uniform flora extended from the Arctic seas through the\r\ngreat central plateau of America far to the south, and in like manner\r\nalong the western coast of Europe. It is also to be observed that, as\r\nGardner points out, there are some differences indicating a diversity\r\nof climate between Greenland and England, and even between Scotland\r\nand Ireland and the south of England, and we have similar differences,\r\nthough not strongly-marked, between the Laramie of northern Canada and\r\nthat of the United States. When all our beds of this age from the Arctic\r\nsea to the 49th parallel have been ransacked for plants, and when the\r\npalæobotanists of the United States shall have succeeded in unravelling\r\nthe confusion which now exists between their Laramie and the Middle\r\nTertiary, the geologist of the future will be able to restore with much\r\ncertainty the distribution of the vast forests which in the early Eocene\r\ncovered the now bare plains of interior America. Further, since the\r\nbreak which in western Europe separates the flora of the Cretaceous from\r\nthat of the Eocene does not exist in America, it will then be possible\r\nto trace the succession from the Mesozoic flora of the Trias and of the\r\nQueen Charlotte Islands and Kootanie series of the Lower Cretaceous up\r\nto the close of the Eocene; and to determine, for America at least, the\r\nmanner and conditions under which the angiospermous flora of the later\r\nCretaceous succeeded to the pines and cycads which characterised the\r\nbeginning of the Cretaceous period. In so far as Europe is concerned,\r\nthis may be more difficult, since the want of continuity of land from\r\nnorth to south seems there to have been fatal to the continuance of some\r\nplants during changes of climate, and there were also apparently in the\r\nKainozoic period invasions at certain times of species from the south and\r\neast, which did not occur to the same extent in America.\r\n\r\nIn recent reports on the Tertiary floras of Australia and New\r\nZealand,[DY] Ettingshausen holds that the flora of the Tertiary, as a\r\nwhole, was of a generalised character; forms now confined to the southern\r\nand northern hemispheres respectively being then common to both. It would\r\nthus seem that the present geographical diversities must have largely\r\narisen from the great changes in climate and distribution of land and\r\nwater in the later Tertiary.\r\n\r\n[DY] \"Geological Magazine,\" August, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe length of our discussion of the early angiospermous flora does not\r\npermit us to trace it in detail through the Miocene and Pliocene, but\r\nwe may notice the connection through these in the next chapter, and may\r\nrefer to the magnificent publications of Heer and Lesquereux on the\r\nTertiary floras of Europe and America respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  PLANTS FROM THE TERTIARY TO THE MODERN PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be well to begin this chapter with a sketch of the general\r\nphysical and geological conditions of the period which was characterised\r\nby the advent and culmination of the dicotyledonous trees.\r\n\r\nIn the Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous periods the prevalence, over the\r\nwhole of the northern hemisphere and for a long time, of a monotonous\r\nassemblage of gymnospermous and acrogenous plants, implies a uniform and\r\nmild climate, and facility for intercommunication in the north. Toward\r\nthe end of the Jurassic and beginning of the Cretaceous, the land of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere was assuming greater dimensions, and the climate\r\nprobably becoming a little less uniform. Before the close of the Lower\r\nCretaceous period the dicotyledonous flora seems to have been introduced,\r\nunder geographical conditions which permitted a warm temperate climate to\r\nextend as far north as Greenland.\r\n\r\nIn the Cenomanian or Middle Cretaceous age we find the northern\r\nhemisphere tenanted with dicotyledonous trees closely allied to those of\r\nmodern times, though still indicating a climate much warmer than that\r\nwhich at present prevails. In this age, extensive but gradual submergence\r\nof land is indicated by the prevalence of chalk and marine limestones\r\nover the surface of both continents; but a circumpolar belt seems to\r\nhave been maintained, protecting the Atlantic and Pacific basins from\r\nfloating ice, and permitting a temperate flora of great richness to\r\nprevail far to the north, and especially along the southern margins and\r\nextensions of the circumpolar land. These seem to have been the physical\r\nconditions which terminated the existence of the old Mesozoic flora and\r\nintroduced that of the Middle Cretaceous.\r\n\r\nAs time advanced the quantity of land gradually increased, and the\r\nextension of new plains along the older ridges of land was coincident\r\nwith the deposition of the great Laramie series, and with the origination\r\nof its peculiar flora, which indicates a mild climate and considerable\r\nvariety of station in mountain, plain, and swamp, as well as in great\r\nsheets of shallow and weedy fresh water.\r\n\r\nIn the Eocene and Miocene periods, the continents gradually assumed their\r\npresent form, and the vegetation became still more modern in aspect.\r\nIn that period of the Eocene, however, in which the great nummulitic\r\nlimestones were deposited, a submergence of land occurred on the eastern\r\ncontinent which must have assimilated its physical conditions to those of\r\nthe Middle Cretaceous. This great change, affecting materially the flora\r\nof Europe, was not equally great in America, which also by the north and\r\nsouth extension of its mountain-chains permitted movements of migration\r\nnot possible in the Old World. From the Eocene downward, the remains of\r\nland-animals and plants are found chiefly in lake-basins occupying the\r\nexisting depressions of the land, though more extensive than those now\r\nremaining. It must also be borne in mind that the great foldings and\r\nfractures of the crust of the earth which occurred at the close of the\r\nEocene, and to which the final elevation of such ranges as the Alps and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains belongs, permanently modified and moulded the forms\r\nof the continents.\r\n\r\nThese statements raise, however, questions as to the precise equivalence\r\nin time of similar floras found in different latitudes. However\r\nequable the climate, there must have been some appreciable difference\r\nin proceeding from north to south. If, therefore, as seems in every\r\nway probable, the new species of plants originated on the Arctic land\r\nand spread themselves southward, this latter process would occur most\r\nnaturally in times of gradual refrigeration or of the access of a more\r\nextreme climate--that is, in times of the elevation of land in the\r\ntemperate latitudes, or, conversely, of local depression of land in the\r\nArctic, leading to invasions of northern ice. Hence, the times of the\r\nprevalence of particular types of plants in the far north would precede\r\nthose of their extension to the south, and a flora found fossil in\r\nGreenland might be supposed to be somewhat older than a similar flora\r\nwhen found farther south. It would seem, however, that the time required\r\nfor the extension of a new flora to its extreme geographical limit is so\r\nsmall, in comparison with the duration of an entire geological period,\r\nthat, practically, this difference is of little moment, or at least does\r\nnot amount to antedating the Arctic flora of a particular type by a whole\r\nperiod, but only by a fraction of such period.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that, during the whole of the Cretaceous and Eocene\r\nperiods, there is any evidence of such refrigeration as seriously to\r\ninterfere with the flora, but perhaps the times of most considerable\r\nwarmth are those of the Dunvegan group in the Middle Cretaceous, and\r\nthose of the later Laramie and oldest Eocene.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that no cause for the mild temperature of the Cretaceous\r\nneeds to be invoked, other than those mutations of land and water which\r\nthe geological deposits themselves indicate. A condition, for example, of\r\nthe Atlantic basin in which the high land of Greenland should be reduced\r\nin elevation, and at the same time the northern inlets of the Atlantic\r\nclosed against the invasion of Arctic ice, would at once restore climatic\r\nconditions allowing of the growth of a temperate flora in Greenland.\r\nAs Dr. Brown has shown,[DZ] and as I have elsewhere argued, the absence\r\nof light in the Arctic winter is no disadvantage, since, during the\r\nwinter, the growth of deciduous trees is in any case suspended; while the\r\nconstant continuance of light in the summer is, on the contrary, a very\r\ngreat stimulus and advantage.\r\n\r\n[DZ] \"Florula Discoana.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable phenomenon in the history of genera of plants in\r\nthe later Mesozoic and Tertiary, that the older genera appear at once\r\nin a great number of specific types, which become reduced as well as\r\nlimited in range down to the modern. This is, no doubt, connected with\r\nthe greater differentiation of local conditions in the modern; but it\r\nindicates also a law of rapid multiplication of species in the early life\r\nof genera. The distribution of the species of _Salisburia_, _Sequoia_,\r\n_Platanus_, _Sassafras_, _Liriodendron_, _Magnolia_, and many other\r\ngenera, affords remarkable proofs of this.\r\n\r\nGray, Saporta, Heer, Newberry, Lesquereux, and Starkie Gardner have all\r\nably discussed these points; but the continual increase of our knowledge\r\nof the several floras, and the removal of error as to the dates of their\r\nappearance, must greatly conduce to clearer and more definite ideas. In\r\nparticular, the prevailing opinion that the Miocene was the period of the\r\ngreatest extension of warmth and of a temperate flora into the Arctic,\r\nmust be abandoned in favour of the later Cretaceous and Eocene; and, if\r\nI mistake not, this will be found to accord better with the evidence of\r\ngeneral geology and of animal fossils.\r\n\r\nIn these various revolutions of the later Cretaceous and Kainozoic\r\nperiods, America, as Dr. Gray has well pointed out, has had the advantage\r\nof a continuous stretch of high land from north to south, affording a\r\nmore sure refuge to plants in times of submergence, and means of escape\r\nto the south in times of refrigeration. Hence, the greater continuity\r\nof American vegetation and the survival of genera like _Sequoia_ and\r\n_Liriodendron_, which have perished in the Old World. Still, there are\r\nsome exceptions to this, for the gingko-tree is a case of survival in\r\nAsia of a type once plentiful in America, but now extinct there. Eastern\r\nAsia has had, however, some considerable share of the same advantage\r\npossessed by America, with the addition, referred to by Gray, of a better\r\nand more insular climate.\r\n\r\nBut our survey of these physical conditions can not be considered\r\ncomplete till we shall have considered the great Glacial age of the\r\nPleistocene. It is certain that throughout the later Miocene and Pliocene\r\nthe area of land in the northern hemisphere was increasing, and the large\r\nand varied continents were tenanted by the noblest vegetation and the\r\ngrandest forms of mammalian life that the earth has ever witnessed. As\r\nthe Pliocene drew to a close, a gradual diminution of warmth came on,\r\nand more especially a less equable climate, and this was accompanied\r\nwith a subsidence of the land in the temperate regions and with changes\r\nof the warm ocean-currents. Thus gradually the summers became cooler\r\nand the winters longer and more severe, the hill-tops became covered\r\nwith permanent snows, glaciers ploughed their way downward into the\r\nplains, and masses and fields of floating ice cooled the seas. In these\r\ncircumstances the richer and more delicate forms of vegetation must have\r\nbeen chilled to death or obliged to remove farther south, and in many\r\nextensive regions, hemmed in by the advance of the sea on the one hand\r\nand land-ice on the other, they must have altogether perished.\r\n\r\nYet even in this time vegetation was not altogether extinct. Along the\r\nGulf of Mexico in America, and in the Mediterranean basin in Europe,\r\nthere were still some remains of a moderate climate and certain boreal\r\nand arctic forms moving southward continued to exist here and there in\r\nsomewhat high latitudes, just as similar plants now thrive in Grinnell\r\nLand within sight of the snows of the Greenland mountains. A remarkable\r\nsummary of some of these facts as they relate to England was given by an\r\neminent English botanist, Mr. Carruthers, in his address as President of\r\nthe Biological Section of the British Association at Birmingham in 1886.\r\nAt Cromer, on the coast of Norfolk, the celebrated forest-bed of newer\r\nPliocene age, and containing the remains of a copious mammalian fauna,\r\nholds also remains of plants in a state admitting of determination. These\r\nhave been collected by Mr. Reid, of the Geological Survey, and were\r\nreported on by Carruthers, who states that they represent a somewhat\r\ncolder temperature than that of the present day. I quote the following\r\ndetails from the address.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the plants of the forest-bed or newer Pliocene he\r\nremarks as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Only one species (_Trapa natans_, Willd.) has disappeared from our\r\nislands. Its fruits, which Mr. Reid found abundantly in one locality,\r\nagree with those of the plants found until recently in the lakes of\r\nSweden. Four species (_Prunus speciosa_, L., _[OE]nanthe Tichenalii_,\r\nSm., _Potamogeton pterophyllus_, Sch., and _Pinus abies_, L.) are found\r\nat present only in Europe, and a fifth (_Potamogeton trichoides_, Cham.)\r\nextends also to North America; two species (_Peucedanum palustre_,\r\nMoench, and _Pinus sylvestris_, L.) are found also in Siberia, while six\r\nmore (_Sanguisorba officinalis_, L., _Rubus fruticosus_, L., 5 _Cornus\r\nsanguinea_, L., _Euphorbia amygdaloides_, L., _Quercus robur_, L., and\r\n_Potamogeton crispus_, L.) extend into western Asia, and two (_Fagus\r\nsylvatica_, L., and _Alnus glutinosa_, L.) are included in the Japanese\r\nflora. Seven species, while found with the others, enter also into the\r\nMediterranean flora, extending to North Africa: these are _Thalictrum\r\nminus_, L., _Thalictrum flavum_, L., _Ranunculus repens_, L., _Stellaria\r\naquatica_, Scop., _Corylus avellana_, L., _Yannichellia palustris_, L.,\r\nand _Cladium mariscus_, Br. With a similar distribution in the Old World,\r\neight species (_Bidens tripartita_, L., _Myosotis cæspitosa_, Schultz,\r\n_Suæda maritima_, Dum., _Ceratophyllum demersum_,, L., _Sparganium\r\nramosum_, Huds., _Potamogeton pectinatus_, L., _Carex paludosa_, Good.,\r\nand _Osmunda regalis_, L.) are found also in North America. Of the\r\nremainder, ten species (_Nuphar luteum_, Sm., _Menyanthes trifoliata_,\r\nL., _Stachys palustris_, L., _Rumex maritimus_, L., _Rumex acetosella_,\r\nL., _Betula alba_, L., _Scirpus pauciflorus_, Lightf., _Taxus baccata_,\r\nL., and _Isoetes lacustris_, L.) extend round the north temperate\r\nzone, while three (_Lycopus europæus_, L., _Alisma plantago_, L., and\r\n_Phragmites communis_, Trim), having the same distribution in the north,\r\nare found also in Australia, and one (_Hippuris vulgaris_, L.) in the\r\nsouth of South America. The list is completed by _Ranunculus aquatilis_,\r\nL., distributed over all the temperate regions of the globe, and _Scirpus\r\nlacustris_, L., which is found in many tropical regions as well.\"\r\n\r\nHe remarks that these plants, while including species now very widely\r\nscattered, present no appreciable change of characters.\r\n\r\nAbove this bed are glacial clays, which hold other species indicating an\r\nextremely cold climate. They are few in number, only _Salix polaris_, a\r\nthoroughly arctic species, and its ally, _S. cinerea_, L., and a moss,\r\n_Hypnum turgescens_, Schimp., no longer found in Britain, but an Alpine\r\nand arctic species. This bed belongs to the beginning of the Glacial\r\nperiod, the deposits of which have as yet afforded no plants in England.\r\nBut plants occur in post-glacial and upper-glacial beds in different\r\nparts of England, to which Carruthers thus refers:\r\n\r\n\"The period of great cold, during which arctic ice extended far into\r\ntemperate regions, was not favorable to vegetable life. But in some\r\nlocalities we have stratified clays with plant-remains later than the\r\nGlacial epoch, yet indicating that the great cold had not then entirely\r\ndisappeared. In the lacustrine beds at Holderness is found a small\r\nbirch (_Betula nana_, L.), now limited in Great Britain to some of the\r\nmountains of Scotland, but found in the arctic regions of the Old and\r\nNew World and on Alpine districts in Europe, and with it _Prunus padus_,\r\nL., _Quercus robur_, L., _Corylus avellana_, L., _Alnus glutinosa_, L.,\r\nand _Pinus sylvestris_, L. In the white clay-beds at Bovey Tracey of\r\nthe same age there occur the leaves of _Arctostaphylos uva-ursi_, L.,\r\nthree species of willow, viz., _Salix cinerea_, L., _S. myrtilloides_,\r\nL., and _S. polaris_, Wahl., and in addition to our Alpine _Betula\r\nnana_, L., the more familiar _B. alba_, L. Two of these plants have\r\nbeen lost to our flora from the change of climate that has taken place,\r\nviz., _Salix myrtilloides_, L., and _S. polaris_, Wahl.; and _Betula\r\nnana_, L., has retreated to the mountains of Scotland. Three others\r\n(_Dryas octopetala_, L., _Arctostaphylos uva-ursi_, L., and _Salix\r\nherbacea_, L.) have withdrawn to the mountains of northern England,\r\nWales, and Scotland, while the remainder are still found scattered over\r\nthe country. Notwithstanding the diverse physical conditions to which\r\nthese plants have been subjected, the remains preserved in these beds\r\npresent no characters by which they can be distinguished from the living\r\nrepresentatives of the species.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the instances referred to is very striking. At Bovey Tracey the\r\narctic beds rest directly on those holding the rich, warm temperate flora\r\nof the Eocene; so that here we have the evidence of fossil plants to show\r\nthe change from the climate of the Eocene to that of arctic lands, and\r\nthe modern vegetation to indicate the return of a warm temperature.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, in the Pleistocene beds known as the Leda clays, intervening\r\nbetween the lower boulder clay and the Saxicava sand, which also holds\r\nboulders, there are beds holding fossil plants, in some places intermixed\r\nwith sea-shells and bones of marine fishes, showing that they were\r\ndrifted into the sea at a time of submergence. These remains are boreal\r\nrather than arctic in character, and with the remains of drift-wood often\r\nfound in the boulder deposits serve to indicate that there were at all\r\ntimes oases of hardy life in the glacial deserts, just as we find these\r\nin polar lands at the present day. I condense from a paper on these\r\nplants[EA] the following facts, with a few additional notes:\r\n\r\n[EA] \"Canadian Naturalist,\" 1866.\r\n\r\nThe importance of all information bearing on the temperature of the\r\nPost-pliocene period invests with much interest the study of the\r\nland-plants preserved in deposits of this age. Unfortunately, these\r\nare few in number, and often not well preserved. In Canada, though\r\nfragments of the woody parts of plants occasionally occur in the marine\r\nclays and sands, there is only one locality which has afforded any\r\nconsiderable quantity of remains of their more perishable parts. This\r\nis the well-known deposit of Leda clay at Green's Creek, on the Ottawa,\r\ncelebrated for the perfection in which the skeletons of the capelin\r\nand other fishes are preserved in the calcareous nodules imbedded in\r\nthe clay. In similar nodules, contained apparently in a layer somewhat\r\nlower than that holding the ichthyolites, remains of land-plants are\r\nsomewhat abundant, and, from their association with shells of _Leda\r\nglacialis_, seem to have been washed down from the land into deep water.\r\nThe circumstances would seem to have been not dissimilar from those\r\nat present existing in the northeast arm of Gaspé Basin, where I have\r\ndredged from mud now being deposited in deep water, living specimens of\r\n_Leda limatula_, mixed with remains of land-plants.\r\n\r\nThe following are the species of plants recognised in these nodules:\r\n\r\n1. _Drosera rotundifolia_, Linn. In a calcareous nodule from Green's\r\nCreek, the leaf only preserved. This plant is common in bogs in Canada,\r\nNova Scotia, and Newfoundland, and thence, according to Hooker, to the\r\nArctic circle. It is also European.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--_Gaylussaccia resinosa_. Pleistocene, Canada.]\r\n\r\n2. _Acer spicatum_, Lamx. (_Acer montanum_, Aiton.) Leaf in a nodule from\r\nGreen's Creek. Found in Nova Scotia and Canada, also at Lake Winnipeg,\r\naccording to Richardson.\r\n\r\n3. _Potentilla Canadensis_, Linn. In nodules from Green's Creek; leaves\r\nonly preserved. I have had some difficulty in determining these, but\r\nbelieve they must be referred to the species above named, or to _P.\r\nsimplex_, Michx., supposed by Hooker and Gray to be a variety. It occurs\r\nin Canada and New England, but I have no information as to its range\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\n4. _Gaylussaccia resinosa_, Torrey and Gray. Leaf in nodule at Green's\r\nCreek. Abundant in New England and in Canada, also on Lake Huron and the\r\nSaskatchewan, according to Richardson (Fig. 77).\r\n\r\n5. _Populus balsamifera_, Linn. Leaves and branches in nodules at Green's\r\nCreek. This is by much the most common species, and its leaves are of\r\nsmall size, as if from trees growing in cold and exposed situations. The\r\nspecies is North American and Asiatic, and abounds in New England and\r\nCanada. It extends to the Arctic circle, and is abundant on the shores\r\nof the Great Slave Lake and on the McKenzie River, and according to\r\nRichardson constitutes much of the drift timber of the Arctic coast (Fig.\r\n78).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--_Populus balsamifera_. Pleistocene, Canada.]\r\n\r\n6. _Thuja occidentalism_ Linn. Trunks and branches in the Leda clay\r\nat Montreal. This tree occurs in New England and Canada, and extends\r\nnorthward into the Hudson Bay territories. It is a northern though\r\nnot arctic species in its geographical range. According to Lyell it\r\noccurs associated with the bones of Mastodon in New Jersey. From the\r\ngreat durability of its wood, it is one of the trees most likely to be\r\npreserved in aqueous deposits.\r\n\r\n7. _Potamogeton perfoliatus_, Linn. Leaves and seeds in nodules at\r\nGreen's Creek. Inhabits streams of the Northern States and Canada, and\r\naccording to Richardson extends to Great Slave Lake.\r\n\r\n8. _Potamogeton pusillus._ Quantities of fragments which I refer to this\r\nspecies occur in nodules at Green's Creek. They may possibly belong to a\r\nvariety of _P. hybridus_ which, together with _P. natans_, now grows in\r\nthe river Ottawa, where it flows over the beds containing these fossils.\r\n\r\n9. _Cariceæ and Gramineæ._ Fragments in nodules from Green's Creek appear\r\nto belong to plants of these groups, but I cannot venture to determine\r\ntheir species.\r\n\r\n10. _Equisetum scirpoides_, Michx. Fragments in nodules, Green's Creek.\r\nThis is a widely distributed species, occurring in the Northern States\r\nand Canada.\r\n\r\n11. _Fontinalis._ In nodules at Green's Creek there occur, somewhat\r\nplentifully, branches of a moss apparently of the genus _Fontinalis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Frond of _Fucus_. Pleistocene, Canada.]\r\n\r\n12. _Algæ._ With the plants above mentioned, both at Green's Creek and at\r\nMontreal, there occur remains of sea-weeds (Fig. 79). They seem to belong\r\nto the genera _Fucus_ and _Ulva_, but I cannot determine the species.\r\nA thick stem in one of the nodules would seem to indicate a large\r\n_Laminaria_. With the above there are found at Green's Creek a number of\r\nfragments of leaves, stems, and fruits, which I have not been able to\r\nrefer to their species, principally on account of their defective state\r\nof preservation.\r\n\r\nNone of the plants above mentioned is properly arctic in its\r\ndistribution, and the assemblage may be characterised as a selection from\r\nthe present Canadian flora of some of the more hardy species having the\r\nmost northern range. Green's Creek is in the central part of Canada, near\r\nto the parallel of 46°, and an accidental selection from its present\r\nflora, though it might contain the same species found in the nodules,\r\nwould certainly include with these, or instead of some of them, more\r\nsouthern forms. More especially the balsam poplar, though that tree\r\noccurs plentifully on the Ottawa, would not be so predominant. But such\r\nan assemblage of drift-plants might be furnished by any American stream\r\nflowing in the latitude of 50° to 55° north. If a stream flowing to the\r\nnorth, it might deposit these plants in still more northern latitudes, as\r\nthe McKenzie River does now. If flowing to the south, it might deposit\r\nthem to the south of 50°. In the case of the Ottawa, the plants could\r\nnot have been derived from a more southern locality, nor probably from\r\none very far to the north. We may therefore safely assume that the\r\nrefrigeration indicated by these plants would place the region bordering\r\nthe Ottawa in nearly the same position with that of the south coast of\r\nLabrador fronting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence at present. The absence of\r\nall the more arctic species occurring in Labrador should perhaps induce\r\nus to infer a somewhat milder climate than this.\r\n\r\nThe moderate amount of refrigeration thus required would in my opinion\r\naccord very well with the probable conditions of climate deducible from\r\nthe circumstances in which the fossil plants in question occur. At the\r\ntime when they were deposited the sea flowed up the Ottawa valley to a\r\nheight of 200 to 400 feet above its present level, and the valley of the\r\nSt. Lawrence was a wide arm of the sea, open to the arctic current. Under\r\nthese conditions the immense quantities of drift-ice from the northward,\r\nand the removal of the great heating surface now presented by the low\r\nlands of Canada and New England, must have given for the Ottawa coast\r\nof that period a summer temperature very similar to that at present\r\nexperienced on the Labrador coast, and with this conclusion the marine\r\nremains of the Leda clay, as well as the few land molluscs whose shells\r\nhave been found in the beds containing the plants, and which are species\r\nstill occurring in Canada, perfectly coincide.\r\n\r\nThe climate of that portion of Canada above water at the time when these\r\nplants were imbedded may safely be assumed to have been colder in summer\r\nthan at present, to an extent equal to about 5° of latitude, and this\r\nrefrigeration may be assumed to correspond with the requirements of\r\nthe actual geographical changes implied. In other words, if Canada was\r\nsubmerged until the Ottawa valley was converted into an estuary inhabited\r\nby species of _Leda_, and frequented by capelin, the diminution of the\r\nsummer heat consequent on such depression would be precisely suitable to\r\nthe plants occurring in these deposits, without assuming any other cause\r\nof change of climate.\r\n\r\nI have arranged elsewhere the Post-pliocene deposits of the central\r\npart of Canada, as consisting of, in ascending order: (1) The boulder\r\nclay; (2) a deep-water deposit, the Leda clay; and (3) a shallow-water\r\ndeposit, the Saxicava sand. But, although I have placed the boulder clay\r\nin the lowest position, it must be observed that I do not regard this as\r\na continuous layer of equal age in all places. On the contrary, though\r\nlocally, as at Montreal, under the Leda clay, it is in other places and\r\nat other levels contemporaneous with or newer than that deposit, which\r\nitself also locally contains boulders.\r\n\r\nAt Green's Creek the plant-bearing nodules occur in the lower part of the\r\nLeda clay, which contains a few boulders, and is apparently in places\r\noverlaid by large boulders, while no distinct boulder clay underlies\r\nit. The circumstances which accumulated the thick bed of boulder clay\r\nnear Montreal were probably absent in the Ottawa valley. In any case we\r\nmust regard the deposits of Green's Creek as coeval with the Leda clay\r\nof Montreal, and with the period of the greatest abundance of _Leda\r\nglacialis_, the most exclusively arctic shell of these deposits. In other\r\nwords, I regard the plants above mentioned as probably belonging to the\r\nperiod of greatest refrigeration of which we have any evidence, of course\r\nnot including that mythical period of universal incasement in ice, of\r\nwhich, as I have elsewhere endeavoured to show, in so far as Canada is\r\nconcerned, there is no evidence whatever.[EB]\r\n\r\n[EB] Notes on Post-Pliocene of Canada, \"Canadian Naturalist,\" 1872.\r\n\r\nThe facts above stated in reference to Post-pliocene plants concur, with\r\nall the other evidence I have been able to obtain, in the conclusion that\r\nthe refrigeration of Canada in the Post-pliocene period consisted of a\r\ndiminution of the summer heat, and was of no greater amount than that\r\nfairly attributable to the great depression of the land and the different\r\ndistribution of the ice-bearing arctic current.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the plants above noticed, it is interesting to\r\nobserve that at Green's Creek, at Pakenham Mills, at Montreal, and at\r\nClarenceville on Lake Champlain, species of Canadian _Pulmonata_ have\r\nbeen found in deposits of the same age with those containing the plants.\r\nThe species which have been noticed belong to the genera _Lymnea_ and\r\n_Planorbis_.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial age was, fortunately, not of very long duration, though its\r\nlength has been much exaggerated by certain schools of geologists,[EC]\r\nIt passed away, and a returning cosmic spring gladdened the earth, and\r\nwas ushered in by a time of great rainfall and consequent denudation\r\nand deposit, which has been styled the \"Pluvial Period\" The remains of\r\nthe Pliocene forests then returned--with somewhat diminished numbers of\r\nspecies--from the south and again occupied the land, though they have\r\nnot been able, in their decimated condition, to restore the exuberance\r\nof the flora of the earlier Tertiary. In point of fact, as we shall\r\nsee in the next chapter, it is the floras originating within the polar\r\ncircle and coming down from the north that are rich and copious. Those\r\nthat, after periods of cold or submergence, return from the south, are\r\ncomparatively poor. Hence the modern flora is far inferior to that of the\r\nMiddle Kainozoic. In America, however, and in eastern Asia, for reasons\r\nalready stated, the return was more abundant than in Europe.\r\n\r\n[EC] This I have long maintained on grounds connected with Pleistocene\r\nfossils, amount of denudation and deposit, &c., and I am glad to see that\r\nPrestwich, the best English authority on such subjects, has recently\r\nannounced similar conclusions, based on independent reasons.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the return of the old temperate flora, the arctic\r\nplants that had overspread the land retreated to mountain-tops, now bared\r\nof ice and snow, and back to the polar lands whence they came; and so it\r\nhappens that, on the White Mountains, the Alps, and the Himalayas, we\r\nhave insular patches of the same groups of plants that exist around the\r\npole.\r\n\r\nThese changes need not have required a very long time, for the\r\nmultiplication and migration of plants are very rapid, especially when\r\naided by the agency of migratory animals. Many parts of the land must,\r\nindeed, have been stocked with plants from various sources, and by\r\nagencies--as that of the sea--which might at first sight seem adverse to\r\ntheir distribution. The British Islands, for example, have no indigenous\r\nplants. Their flora consists mainly of Germanic plants, which must have\r\nmigrated to Britain in that very late period of the Post-glacial when\r\nthe space now occupied by the North Sea was mostly dry land. Other\r\nportions of it are Scandinavian plants, perhaps survivors of the Glacial\r\nage, or carried by migratory birds; and still another element consists\r\nof Spanish plants, brought north by spring migrants, and establishing\r\nthemselves in warm and sheltered spots, just as the arctic plants do on\r\nthe bleak hill-tops. The Bermudas, altogether recent islands, have one\r\nhundred and fifty species of native plants, all of which are West Indian\r\nand American, and must have been introduced by the sea-currents or by\r\nmigratory birds.\r\n\r\nAnd so the earth became fitted for the residence of modern man. Yet it is\r\nnot so good or Edenic a world as it once was, or as it may yet become,\r\nwere another revolution to restore a mild climate to the arctic regions,\r\nand to send down a new swarm of migratory species to renew the face of\r\nthe earth and restore it to its pristine fertility of vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThus closes this long history of the succession of plants, reaching\r\nfrom the far back Laurentian to the present day. It has, no doubt, many\r\nbreaks, and much remains to be discovered. Yet it may lead us to some\r\npositive conclusions regarding the laws of the introduction of plants.\r\n\r\nOne of these, and perhaps the most remarkable of all, is that certain\r\nprinciples were settled very far back, and have remained ever since.\r\nWe have seen that in the earliest geological periods all that pertains\r\nto the structure, powers, and laws of the vegetable cell was already\r\nfixed and settled. When we consider how much this implies of mechanical\r\nstructure and chemical and vital property, the profound significance\r\nof this statement becomes apparent. The relations in these respects\r\nbetween the living cell and the soil, the atmosphere and the sunshine,\r\nwere apparently as perfect in the early Palæozoic as in any subsequent\r\ntime. The same may be said of the structures of the leaf and of the\r\nstem. In such old forms as Nematophyton these were, it is true, peculiar\r\nand rudimentary, but in the Devonian and Carboniferous the structure\r\nof leaves and stems embodied all the parts and principles that we find\r\nat present. In regard to fructification there has been more progress,\r\nfor, so far as we know, the highest and most complex forms of flowery,\r\nfruits, and seeds belong to the more recent periods, and simpler forms\r\nwere at least dominant in the older times. Yet even in this respect the\r\ngreat leading laws and structures of bisexual reproduction were perfected\r\nin the early Palæozoic, and the improvements introduced in the gymnosperm\r\nand the angiosperm of later periods have consisted mainly in additions of\r\naccessory parts, and in modifications and refinements suited to the wants\r\nof the higher and more complex types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGENERAL LAWS OF ORIGIN AND MIGRATIONS OF PLANTS.--RELATIONS OF RECENT\r\nAND FOSSIL FLORAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origination of the successive floras which have occupied the northern\r\nhemisphere in geological time, not, as one might at first sight suppose,\r\nin the sunny climes of the south, but under the arctic skies, is a fact\r\nlong known or suspected. It is proved by the occurrence of fossil plants\r\nin Greenland, in Spitzbergen, and in Grinnell Land, under circumstances\r\nwhich show that these were their primal homes. The fact bristles with\r\nphysical difficulties, yet is fertile of the most interesting theoretical\r\ndeductions, to reach which we may well be content to wade through some\r\nintricate questions. Though not at all a new fact, its full significance\r\nseems only recently to have dawned on the minds of geologists, and within\r\nthe last few years it has produced a number of memoirs and addresses to\r\nlearned societies, besides many less formal notices.[ED]\r\n\r\n[ED] Saporta, \"Ancienne Végétation Polaire\"; Hooker, \"Presidential\r\nAddress to Royal Society,\" 1878; Thistleton Dyer, \"Lecture on Plant\r\nDistribution\"; Mr. Starkie Gardner, \"Letters in 'Nature,'\" 1878, &c. The\r\nbasis of most of these brochures is to be found in Heer's \"Flora Fossilis\r\nArctica.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest suggestion on the subject known to the writer is that of\r\nProf. Asa Gray, in 1867, with reference to the probable northern source\r\nof the related floras of North America and eastern Asia. With the aid\r\nof the new facts disclosed by Heer and Lesquereux, Gray returned to\r\nthe subject in 1872, and more fully developed this conclusion with\r\nreference to the Tertiary floras,[EE] and he has recently still further\r\ndiscussed these questions in an able lecture on \"Forest Geography and\r\nArchæology.\"[EF] In this he puts the case so well and tersely that we may\r\nquote the following sentences as a text for what follows:\r\n\r\n[EE] Address to American Association.\r\n\r\n[EF] \"American Journal of Science,\" xvi., 1818.\r\n\r\n\"I can only say, at large, that the same species (of Tertiary fossil\r\nplants) have been found all round the world; that the richest and\r\nmost extensive finds are in Greenland; that they comprise most of\r\nthe sorts which I have spoken of, as American trees which once lived\r\nin Europe--magnolias, sassafras, hickories, gum-trees, our identical\r\nsouthern cypress (for all we can see of difference), and especially\r\n_Sequoias_, not only the two which obviously answer to the two\r\nbig-trees now peculiar to California, but several others; that they\r\nequally comprise trees now peculiar to Japan and China, three kinds of\r\ngingko-trees, for instance, one of them not evidently distinguishable\r\nfrom the Japan species which alone survives; that we have evidence, not\r\nmerely of pines and maples, poplars, birches, lindens, and whatever\r\nelse characterise the temperate zone forests of our era, but also of\r\nparticular species of these, so like those of our own time and country\r\nthat we may fairly reckon them as the ancestors of several of ours. Long\r\ngenealogies always deal more or less in conjecture; but we appear to\r\nbe within the limits of scientific inference when we announce that our\r\nexisting temperate trees came from the north, and within the bounds of\r\nnigh probability when we claim not a few of them as the originals of\r\npresent species. Remains of the same plants have been found fossil in our\r\ntemperate region as well as in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nBetween 1860 and 1870 the writer was engaged in working out all that\r\ncould be learned of the Devonian plants of eastern America, the oldest\r\nknown flora of any richness, and which consists almost exclusively of\r\ngigantic, and to us grotesque, representatives of the club-mosses,\r\nferns, and mares'-tails, with some trees allied to the cycads and pines.\r\nIn this pursuit nearly all the more important localities were visited,\r\nand access was had to the large collections of Prof. Hall and Prof.\r\nNewberry, in New York and Ohio, and to those made in the remarkable\r\nplant-bearing beds of New Brunswick by Messrs. Matthew and Hartt. In\r\nthe progress of these researches, which developed an unexpectedly rich\r\nassemblage of species, the northern origin of this old flora seemed to be\r\nestablished by its earlier culmination in the northeast, in connection\r\nwith the growth of the American land to the southward, which took place\r\nafter the great Upper Silurian subsidence, by elevations beginning in\r\nthe north while those portions of the continent to the southwest still\r\nremained under the sea. The same result was indicated by the persistence\r\nin the Carboniferous of the south and west of old Erian forms, like\r\n_Megalopteris_.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1870, the labours of those ten years were brought before the\r\nRoyal Society of London, in the Bakerian lecture of that year, and in a\r\nmemoir illustrating no less than one hundred and twenty-five species of\r\nplants older than the great Carboniferous system, these deductions were\r\nstated in connection with the conclusions of Hall, Logan, and Dana, as\r\nto the distribution of sediment along the northeast side of the American\r\ncontinent, and the anticipation was hazarded that the oldest Palæozoic\r\nfloras would be discovered to the north of Newfoundland. Mention was also\r\nmade of the apparent earlier and more copious birth of the Devonian flora\r\nin America than in Europe, a fact which is itself connected with the\r\ngreater northward extension of this continent.\r\n\r\nThe memoir containing these results was not published by the Royal\r\nSociety, but its publication was secured in a less complete form in the\r\nreports of the \"Geological Survey of Canada.\" The part of the memoir\r\nrelating to Canadian fossil plants, with a portion of the theoretical\r\ndeductions, was published in a report issued in 1871.[EG] In this report\r\nthe following language was used:\r\n\r\n[EG] \"Fossil Plants of the Devonian and Upper Silurian Formations of\r\nCanada,\" pp. 92, twenty plates, Montreal, 1871.\r\n\r\n\"In eastern America, from the Carboniferous period onward, the centre\r\nof plant distribution has been the Appalachian chain. From this the\r\nplants and sediments extended westward in times of elevation, and to this\r\nthey receded in times of depression. But this centre was nonexistent\r\nbefore the Devonian period, and the centre for this must have been to\r\nthe northeast, whence the great mass of older Appalachian sediment\r\nwas derived. In the Carboniferous period there was also an eastward\r\ndistribution from the Appalachians, and links of connection in the\r\nAtlantic bed between the floras of Europe and America. In the Devonian\r\nsuch connection can have been only far to the northeast. It is therefore\r\nin Newfoundland, Labrador, and Greenland that we are to look for the\r\noldest American flora, and in like manner on the border of the old\r\nScandinavian nucleus for that of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Again, it must have been the wide extension of the sea of the\r\ncorniferous limestone that gave the last blow to the remaining flora of\r\nthe Lower Devonian; and the re-elevation in the middle of that epoch\r\nbrought in the Appalachian ridges as a new centre, and established\r\na connection with Europe which introduced the Upper Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous floras. Lastly, from the comparative richness of the later\r\nErian[EH] flora in eastern America, especially in the St. John beds, it\r\nmight be a fair inference that the northeastern end of the Appalachian\r\nridge was the original birthplace or centre of creation of what we may\r\ncall the later Palæozoic flora, or of a large part of that flora.\"\r\n\r\n[EH] See pages 107 and 108.\r\n\r\nWhen my paper was written I had not seen the account published by\r\nthe able Swiss palæobotanist Heer, of the remarkable Devonian flora\r\nof Bear Island, near Spitzbergen.[EI] From want of acquaintance with\r\nthe older floras of America and western Europe, Heer fell into the\r\nunfortunate error of regarding the whole of Bear Island plants as\r\nLower Carboniferous, a mistake which his great authority has tended to\r\nperpetuate, and which has even led to the still graver error of some\r\nEuropean geologists, who do not hesitate to regard as Carboniferous the\r\nfossil plants of the American deposits from the Hamilton to the Chemung\r\ngroups inclusive, though these belong to formations underlying the oldest\r\nCarboniferous, and characterised by animal remains of unquestioned\r\nDevonian age. In 1872 I addressed a note to the Geological Society of\r\nLondon on the subject of the so-called \"Ursa stage\" of Heer, showing\r\nthat, though it contained some forms not known at so early a date in\r\ntemperate Europe, it was clearly, in part at least, Devonian when tested\r\nby North American standards; but that in this high latitude, in which,\r\nfor reasons stated in the report above referred to, I believed the\r\nDevonian plants to have originated, there might be an intermixture of the\r\ntwo floras. But such a mixed group should in that latitude be referred\r\nto a lower horizon than if found in temperate regions. Dr. Nathorst,\r\nas already stated, has recently obtained new facts which go to show\r\nthat plants of two distinct horizons may have been intermixed in the\r\ncollections submitted to Heer.\r\n\r\n[EI] \"Transactions of the Swedish Academy\" 1871; \"Journal of the London\r\nGeological Society,\" vol. xxviii.\r\n\r\nBetween 1870 and 1873 my attention was turned to the two sub-floras\r\nintermediate between those of the Devonian and the coal-formation, the\r\nfloras of the Lower Carboniferous (Subcarboniferous of some American\r\ngeologists) and the Millstone Grit, and in a report upon these[EJ]\r\nsimilar deductions were expressed. It was stated that in Newfoundland\r\nthe coal-beds seem to belong to the Millstone Grit series, and as we\r\nproceed southward they belong to progressively newer portions of the\r\nCarboniferous system. The same fact is observed in the coal-beds of\r\nScotland, as compared with those of England, and it indicates that the\r\ncoal-formation flora, like that of the Devonian, spread itself from the\r\nnorth, and this accords with the somewhat extensive occurrence of Lower\r\nCarboniferous rocks and fossils in the Parry Islands and elsewhere in the\r\narctic regions.\r\n\r\n[EJ] \"Fossil Plants of Lower Carboniferous and Millstone Grit Formations\r\nof Canada,\" pp. 47, ten plates, Montreal, 1873.\r\n\r\nPassing over the comparatively poor flora of the earlier Mesozoic,\r\nconsisting largely of cycads, pines, and ferns, and as yet little\r\nknown in the arctic, and which may have originated in the south,\r\nthough represented, according to Heer, by the supposed Jurassic flora\r\nof Siberia, we find, especially at Komé and Atané in Greenland, an\r\ninteresting occurrence of those earliest precursors of the truly modern\r\nforms of plants which appear in the Cretaceous, the period of the English\r\nchalk and of the New Jersey greensands. There are two plant-groups of\r\nthis age in Greenland; one, that of Komé, consists almost entirely of\r\nferns, cycads, and pines, and is of decidedly Mesozoic aspect. This is\r\ncalled Lower Cretaceous. The other, that of Atané, holds remains of many\r\nmodern temperate genera, as _Populus_, _Myrica_, _Ficus_, _Sassafras_,\r\nand _Magnolia_. This is regarded as Upper Cretaceous. Resting upon\r\nthese Upper Cretaceous beds, without the intervention of any other\r\nformation,[EK] are beds rich in plants of much more modern appearance,\r\nand referred by Heer to the Miocene period, a reference, as we have\r\nseen, not warranted by comparison with the Tertiary plants of Europe or\r\nof America. Still farther north this so-called Miocene assemblage of\r\nplants appears in Spitzbergen and Grinnell Land; but there, owing to the\r\npredominance of trees allied to the spruces, it has a decidedly more\r\nboreal character than in Greenland, as might be anticipated from its\r\nnearer approach to the pole.[EL]\r\n\r\n[EK] Nordenskiöld, \"Expedition to Greenland,\" \"Geological Magazine,\" 1872.\r\n\r\n[EL] Yet even here the bald cypress (_Taxodium distichum_), or a tree\r\nnearly allied to it, is found, though this species is now limited to\r\nthe Southern States. Fielden and De Ranee, \"Journal of the Geological\r\nSociety,\" 1878.\r\n\r\nIf now we turn to the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras of western America,\r\nas described by Lesquereux, Newberry, and others, we find in the lowest\r\nCretaceous rocks there known--those of the Dakota group--which may be\r\nin the lower part of the Middle Cretaceous, a series of plants[EM]\r\nessentially similar to those of the so-called Upper Cretaceous of\r\nGreenland. They occur in beds indicating land and fresh-water conditions\r\nas prevalent at the time over great areas of the interior of America.\r\nBut overlying this plant-bearing formation we have an oceanic limestone\r\n(the Niobrara), corresponding in many respects to the European chalk,\r\nand extending far north into the British territory,[EN] indicating that\r\nthe land of the Lower Cretaceous was replaced by a vast Mediterranean\r\nSea, filled with warm water from the equatorial currents, and not\r\ninvaded by cold waters from the north. This is succeeded by thick Upper\r\nCretaceous deposits of clay and sandstone, with marine remains, though\r\nvery sparsely distributed; and these show that further subsidence or\r\ndenudation in the north had opened a way for the arctic currents, killing\r\nout the warm-water animals of the Niobrara group, and rilling up the\r\nMediterranean of that period. Of the flora of these Upper Cretaceous\r\nperiods, which must have been very long, we know something in the\r\ninterior regions, from the discovery of a somewhat rich flora in the\r\nDunvegan beds of the Peace River district, on the northern shore of the\r\ngreat Cretaceous Mediterranean;[EO] and on the coast of British Columbia\r\nwe have the remarkable Cretaceous coal-field of Vancouver Island, which\r\nholds the remains of plants of modern genera, and, indeed, of almost\r\nas modern aspect as those of the so-called Miocene of Greenland. They\r\nindicate, however, a warmer climate as then prevalent on the Pacific\r\ncoast, and in this respect correspond with a peculiar transition flora,\r\nintermediate between the Cretaceous and Eocene or earliest Tertiary of\r\nthe interior regions, and which is described by Lesquereux as the Lower\r\nLignitic.\r\n\r\n[EM] Lesquereux, \"Report on Cretaceous Flora.\"\r\n\r\n[EN] G. M. Dawson, \"Report on Forty-ninth Parallel.\"\r\n\r\n[EO] \"Reports of Dr. G. M. Dawson, Geological Survey of Canada.\" Also,\r\n\"Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada,\" vol. i.\r\n\r\nImmediately above these Upper Cretaceous beds we have the great\r\nLignite Tertiary of the West--the Laramie group of recent American\r\nreports--abounding in fossil plants, at one time regarded as Miocene,\r\nbut now known to be Lower Eocene, though farther south extending upward\r\ntoward the Miocene age.[EP] These beds, with their characteristic plants,\r\nhave been traced into the British territory north of the forty-ninth\r\nparallel, and it has been shown that their fossils are identical with\r\nthose of the McKenzie River valley, described by Heer as Miocene, and\r\nprobably also with those of Alaska, referred to the same age.[EQ] Now\r\nthis truly Eocene flora of the temperate and northern parts of America\r\nhas so many species in common with that called Miocene in Greenland that\r\nits identity can scarcely be doubted. These facts have led to scepticism\r\nas to the Miocene age of the upper plant-bearing beds of Greenland, and\r\nmore especially Mr. J. Starkie Gardner has ably argued, from comparison\r\nwith the Eocene flora of England and other considerations, that they are\r\nreally of that earlier date.[ER]\r\n\r\n[EP] Lesquereux's \"Tertiary Flora\"; \"White on the Laramie Group\";\r\nStevenson, \"Geological Relations of Lignitic Groups,\" American\r\nPhilosophical Society, June, 1875; Dawson, \"Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety of Canada,\" vol. iv.; Ward, \"Bulletin of United States Geological\r\nSurvey.\"\r\n\r\n[EQ] G. M. Dawson, \"Report on the Geology of the Forty-ninth Parallel,\"\r\nwhere full details on these points may be found. \"Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Society of Canada,\" vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[ER] \"Nature,\" December 12, 1878.\r\n\r\nIn looking at this question, we may fairly assume that no climate,\r\nhowever equable, could permit the vegetation of the neighbourhood of\r\nDisco in Greenland to be exactly identical with that of Colorado and\r\nMissouri, at a time when little difference of level existed in the two\r\nregions. Either the southern flora migrated north in consequence of a\r\ngreater amelioration of climate, or the northern flora moved southward as\r\nthe climate became colder. The same argument, as Gardner has ably shown,\r\napplies to the similarity of the Tertiary plants of temperate Europe to\r\nthose of Greenland. If Greenland required a temperature of about 50°,\r\nas Heer calculates, to maintain its Eocene flora, the temperature of\r\nEngland and that of the Southwestern States must have been higher, though\r\nprobably more equable, than at present.\r\n\r\nWe cannot certainly affirm anything respecting the migrations of these\r\nfloras, but there are some probabilities which deserve attention. The\r\nferns and cycads of the so-called Lower Cretaceous of Greenland are\r\nnothing but a continuation of the previous Jurassic flora. Now this was\r\nestablished at an equally early date in the Queen Charlotte Islands,[ES]\r\nand still earlier in Virginia,[ET] The presumption is, therefore,\r\nthat it came from the south. It has, indeed, the facies of a southern\r\nhemisphere and insular flora, and probably spread itself northward as\r\nfar as Greenland, at a time when our northern continents were groups of\r\nislands, and when the ocean currents were carrying warm water far toward\r\nthe arctic regions. The flora which succeeds this in the sections at\r\nAtané has no special affinities with the southern hemisphere, and is of\r\na more temperate and continental character.[EU] It is not necessarily\r\nUpper Cretaceous, since it is similar to that of the Dakota group farther\r\nsouth, and this is at least Middle Cretaceous. This flora must have\r\noriginated either somewhere in temperate America or within the Arctic\r\ncircle, and it must have replaced the older one by virtue of increasing\r\ncoolness and continental character of climate. It must, therefore, have\r\nbeen connected with that elevation of the land which took place at the\r\nbeginning of the Cretaceous. During this elevation it spread over all\r\nwestern America at one time or another, and, as the land again subsided\r\nunder the sea of the Niobrara chalk, it assumed an aspect more suited\r\nto a warm climate, but still held its place on such islands as remained\r\nabove water along the Pacific coast and in the north, and it continued\r\nto exist on these islands till the colder seas of the Upper Cretaceous\r\nhad again given place to the warm plains and land-locked brackish seas\r\nor fresh-water lakes of the Laramie period (Eocene). Thus the true Upper\r\nCretaceous marks a cool period intervening between the so-called Upper\r\nCretaceous (really Middle Cretaceous) and the so-called Miocene (really\r\nLower Eocene) floras of Greenland.\r\n\r\n[ES] \"Reports of the Geological Survey of Canada.\"\r\n\r\n[ET] Fontaine has well described the Mesozoic flora of Virginia,\r\n\"American Journal of Science,\" January, 1879, and \"Report on Early\r\nMesozoic Floras.\"\r\n\r\n[EU] In the \"Proceedings of the Royal Society of Tasmania,\" 1887, Mr. R.\r\nM. Johnston, F. L. S., states that in the Miocene beds of Tasmania trees\r\nof European genera abound. The Mesozoic flora of that island is of the\r\nusual conifero-cycadean type. Ettingshausen makes a similar statement in\r\nthe \"Geological Magazine\" respecting the Tertiary flora of Australia and\r\nNew Zealand, stating that, like the Tertiary floras of Europe, they have\r\na mixed character, being partly of types now belonging to the northern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis latter established itself in Greenland, and probably all around the\r\nArctic circle, in the warm period of the earliest Eocene, and, as the\r\nclimate of the northern hemisphere became gradually reduced from that\r\ntime till the end of the Pliocene, it marched on over both continents to\r\nthe southward, chased behind by the modern arctic flora, and eventually\r\nby the frost and snow of the Glacial age. This history may admit of\r\ncorrection in details; but, so far as present knowledge extends, it is in\r\nthe main not far from the truth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first great question which it raises is that as to the causes\r\nof the alternations of warm and cold climates in the north, apparently\r\ndemanded by the vicissitudes of the vegetable kingdom. Here we may set\r\naside the idea that in former times plants were suited to endure greater\r\ncold than at present. It is true that some of the fossil Greenland\r\nplants are of unknown genera, and many are species new to us; but we are\r\non the whole safe in affirming that they must have required conditions\r\nsimilar to those necessary to their modern representatives, except within\r\nsuch limits as we now find to hold in similar cases among existing\r\nplants. Still we know that at the present time many species found in\r\nthe equable climate of England will not live in Canada, though species\r\nto all appearance similar in structure are native here. There is also\r\nsome reason to suppose that species when new may have greater hardiness\r\nand adaptability than when in old age and verging toward extinction. In\r\nany case these facts can account for but a small part of the phenomena,\r\nwhich require to be explained by physical changes affecting the earth as\r\na whole, or at least the northern hemisphere. Many theoretical views have\r\nbeen suggested on this subject, and perhaps the most practical way of\r\ndisposing of these will be first to set aside a number which are either\r\nprecluded by the known facts, incapable of producing the effects, or\r\naltogether uncertain as to their possible occurrence.\r\n\r\n1. In this class we may place the theory that the poles of the earth have\r\nchanged their position. Independently of astronomical objections, there\r\nis good geological evidence that the poles of the earth must have been\r\nnearly in their present places from the dawn of life until now. From the\r\nLaurentian upward, those organic limestones which mark the areas where\r\nwarm and shallow equatorial water was spreading over submerged continents\r\nare so disposed as to prove the permanence of the poles. In like manner\r\nall the great foldings of the crust of the earth have followed lines\r\nwhich are parts of great circles tangent to the existing polar circles.\r\nSo, also, from the Cambrian age the great drift of sediment from the\r\nnorth has followed the line of the existing Arctic currents from the\r\nnortheast to the southwest, throwing itself, for example, along the line\r\nof the Appalachian uplifts in eastern America, and against the ridge of\r\nthe Cordilleras in the west.\r\n\r\n2. Some of the above considerations, along with astronomical evidence,\r\nprevent us from assuming any considerable change in the obliquity of the\r\naxis of the earth during geological time.\r\n\r\n3. That the earth and the sun have diminished in heat during geological\r\ntime seems probable; but physical and geological facts alike render it\r\ncertain that this influence could have produced no appreciable effect,\r\neven in the times of the earliest floras, and certainly not in the case\r\nof Tertiary vegetation.\r\n\r\n4. It has been supposed that the earth may have at different times\r\ntraversed more or less heated zones of space, giving alternations of warm\r\nand cold temperature. No such differences in space are, however, known,\r\nnor does there seem any good ground for imagining their existence.\r\n\r\n5. The heat of the sun is known to be variable, and the eleven years'\r\nperiod of sun-spots has recently attracted much attention as producing\r\nappreciable effects on the seasons. There may possibly be longer cycles\r\nof solar energy, or the sun may be liable, like some variable stars, to\r\nparoxysms of increased energy. Such changes are possible, and may fairly\r\nbe taken into the account, provided that we fail to find known causes\r\nsufficient to account for the phenomena.\r\n\r\nOf well-known causes there seem to be but three. These are: First, that\r\nurged by Lyell--viz., the varying distribution of land and water along\r\nwith that of marine currents; secondly, the varying eccentricity of\r\nthe earth's orbit, along with the precession of the equinoxes, and the\r\neffects of this on oceanic circulation, as illustrated by Croll; thirdly,\r\nthe different conditions of the earth's atmosphere with reference to\r\nradiation, as argued by Tyndall and Hunt. As these causes are all founded\r\non known facts, and not exclusive of each other, we may consider them\r\ntogether. I shall take the Lyellian theory first, regarding it as the\r\nmost important, and the best supported by geological facts.\r\n\r\nWe know that the present distribution of land and water greatly\r\ninfluences climate, more especially by affecting that of the ocean\r\ncurrents and of the winds, and by the different action of land as\r\ncompared with water in the reception and radiation of heat. The\r\npresent distribution of land gives a large predominance to the arctic\r\nand sub-arctic regions, as compared with the equatorial and with the\r\nantarctic; and we might readily imagine other distributions that would\r\ngive very different results. But this is not an imaginary case. We\r\nknow that, while the forms and positions of the great continents have\r\nbeen fixed from a very early date, they have experienced many great\r\nsubmergences and re-elevations, and that these have occurred in somewhat\r\nregular sequence, as evidenced by the cyclical alternations of organic\r\nlimestones and earthy sediments in successive geological formations.\r\n\r\nAn example bearing on our present subject may serve to illustrate this.\r\nIn the latter part of the Upper Silurian period (the Lower Helderberg\r\nage), vast areas of the American continent[EV] were covered with an\r\nocean in which were deposited organic limestones whose fossils show\r\nthat this great interior sea was pervaded by equatorial waters bringing\r\nfood and warmth, while the incipient ranges of the Appalachians on the\r\neast, and the Cordilleras on the west, and the Laurentian axis on the\r\nnorth, fenced off from it the colder arctic waters. How different must\r\nthe climate of America and of the region north of it have been in these\r\ncircumstances from that which prevails at present, or from that which\r\nprevailed in certain other periods, when it was open to the incursions\r\nof the arctic ice-laden currents, bearing loads of fine sediment![EW] It\r\nwas in these circumstances, and in the similar circumstances in which the\r\ngreat Corniferous limestone of the Devonian was deposited--a limestone\r\nshowing in its rich coral fauna even warmer waters than those of the\r\nLower Helderberg--that the Devonian flora took its origin in the north\r\nand advanced southward over new lands in process of emergence from the\r\nsea. The somewhat similar condition evidenced by the Lower Carboniferous\r\nlimestone preceded the advent of the great and rich flora of the\r\ncoal-formation.\r\n\r\n[EV] See a memoir and map by Prof. Hall, \"Reports of the Regents of New\r\nYork,\" 1874-'75.\r\n\r\n[EW] It seems certain that the faunæ of the old limestones, like the\r\nTrenton, Niagara, Lower Helderberg, and Corniferous, belong to warm and\r\nsheltered sea areas, and that those rich in graptolites and trilobites,\r\nenclosed in muddy sediments, belong to the colder arctic waters. Such\r\narctic faunæ are those of the Quebec group and of the Utica shale, and to\r\nsome extent that of the Hamilton group.\r\n\r\nLyell's theory on this subject has, I think, in some recent publications,\r\nbeen somewhat misapprehended. It is true that he stated hypothetically\r\ntwo contrasted conditions of distribution, in one of which all the land\r\nwas equatorial, in another all polar; but he did not suppose that these\r\nconditions had actually occurred; and even in his earlier editions,\r\nbefore the recent discoveries and discussions as to ocean currents,\r\nhe was always careful to attach due value to these in connection with\r\nsubsidences and elevations.[EX] In his later editions he introduced more\r\nfull references to current action, and also stated Croll's theory, but\r\nstill maintained the validity of his original conclusions.\r\n\r\n[EX] See \"Principles of Geology,\" edition of 1840, chapter vii.\r\n\r\nThe sufficiency of this Lyellian theory to account for the facts, in so\r\nfar as plants are concerned, may, I think, be inferred from the course\r\nof the isothermal lines at present. The south end of Greenland is on\r\nthe latitude of Christiania in Norway on the one hand, and of Fort\r\nLiard in the Peace River region on the other; and while Greenland is\r\nclad in ice and snow, wheat and other grains, and the ordinary trees\r\nof temperate climates, grow at the latter places,[EY] It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that only exceptionally unfavourable circumstances prevent\r\nthe Greenland area from still possessing a temperate flora, and these\r\nunfavourable circumstances possibly tell even on the localities with\r\nwhich we have compared it. Further, the mouth of the McKenzie River is in\r\nthe same latitude with Disco, near which are some of the most celebrated\r\nlocalities of fossil Cretaceous and Tertiary plants. Yet the mouth of\r\nthe McKenzie River enjoys a much more favourable climate and has a much\r\nmore abundant flora than Disco. If north Greenland were submerged, and\r\nlow land reaching to the south terminated at Disco, and if from any cause\r\neither the cold currents of Baffin's Bay were arrested, or additional\r\nwarm water thrown into the North Atlantic by the Gulf Stream, there is\r\nnothing to prevent a mean temperature of 45° Fahr. from prevailing at\r\nDisco; and the estimate ordinarily formed of the requirements of its\r\nextinct floras is 50°,[EZ] which is probably above rather than below the\r\nactual temperature required.\r\n\r\n[EY] See \"Macoun's Report,\" \"Geological Survey of Canada,\" and\r\nRichardson's \"Boat Voyage.\"\r\n\r\n[EZ] Heer. See, also, papers by Prof. Haughton and by Gardner in \"Nature\"\r\nfor 1878.\r\n\r\nSince, then, geological facts assure us of mutations of the continents\r\nmuch greater than those apparently required to account for the changes of\r\nclimate implied in the existence of the ancient arctic floras, it does\r\nnot seem absolutely necessary to invoke any others.[FA] If, however,\r\nthere are other true causes which might either aid or counteract those\r\nabove referred to, it may be well to consider them.\r\n\r\n[FA] Sir William Thomson, \"Transactions of the Geological Society of\r\nGlasgow,\" February 22, 1878.\r\n\r\nMr. Croll has, in his valuable work \"Climate and Time\" and in various\r\nmemoirs, brought forward an ingenious astronomical theory to account\r\nfor changes of climate. This theory, as stated by himself in a recent\r\npaper,[FB] is that when the eccentricity of the earth's orbit is at a\r\nhigh value, and the northern winter solstice is in perihelion, agencies\r\nare brought into operation which make the southeast trade-winds stronger\r\nthan the northeast, and compel them to blow over upon the northern\r\nhemisphere as far as the Tropic of Cancer. The result is that all the\r\ngreat equatorial currents of the ocean are impelled into the northern\r\nhemisphere, which thus, in consequence of the immense accumulation of\r\nwarm water, has its temperature raised, so that ice and snow must to a\r\ngreat extent disappear from the arctic regions. In the prevalence of\r\nthe converse conditions, the arctic zone becomes clad in ice, and the\r\nsouthern has its temperature raised.\r\n\r\n[FB] \"Cataclysmic Theories of Geological Climate,\" \"Geological Magazine,\"\r\nMay, 1878.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, according to Croll's calculations, the accumulation\r\nof ice on either pole would tend, by shifting the earth's centre of\r\ngravity, to raise the level of the ocean and submerge the land on the\r\ncolder hemisphere. Thus a submergence of land would coincide with a cold\r\ncondition, and emergence with increasing warmth. Facts already referred\r\nto, however, show that this has not always been the case, but that in\r\nmany cases submergence was accompanied with the influx of warm equatorial\r\nwaters and a raised temperature, this apparently depending on the\r\nquestion of local distribution of land and water; and this in its turn\r\nbeing regulated not always by mere shifting of the centre of gravity,\r\nbut by foldings occasioned by contraction, by equatorial subsidences\r\nresulting from the retardation of the earth's rotation, and by the excess\r\nof material abstracted by ice and frost from the arctic regions, and\r\ndrifted southward along the lines of arctic currents. This drifting must\r\nin all geological times have greatly exceeded, as it certainly does at\r\npresent, the denudation caused by atmospheric action at the equator,\r\nand must have tended to increase the disposition to equatorial collapse\r\noccasioned by retardation of rotation.[FC]\r\n\r\n[FC] Croll, in \"Climate and Time,\" and in a note read before the British\r\nAssociation in 1876, takes an opposite view; but this is clearly contrary\r\nto the facts of sedimentation, which show a steady movement of _débris_\r\ntoward the south and southwest.\r\n\r\nWhile such considerations as those above referred to tend to reduce\r\nthe practical importance of Mr. Croll's theory., on the other hand\r\nthey tend to remove one of the greatest objections against it--namely,\r\nthat founded on the necessity of supposing that glacial periods recur\r\nwith astronomical regularity in geological time. They cannot do so if\r\ndependent on other causes inherent in the earth itself, and producing\r\nimportant movements of its crust.\r\n\r\nThe third great cause of warmer climates in the past is the larger\r\nproportion of carbon dioxide, or carbonic-acid gas, in the atmosphere in\r\nearly geological times, as proved by the immense amount of carbon now\r\nsealed up in limestone and coal, and which must at one time have been in\r\nthe air. It has been shown that a very small additional quantity of this\r\nsubstance would so obstruct radiation of heat from the earth as to act\r\nalmost like a glass roof. If, however, the quantity of carbonic acid,\r\ngreat at first, was slowly and regularly removed, even if, as suggested\r\nby Hunt, small additional supplies were gradually added from space, this\r\ncause could have affected only the very oldest floras. But it is known\r\nthat some comets and meteorites contain carbonaceous matter, and this\r\nallows us to suppose that accessions of carbon may have been communicated\r\nat irregular intervals. If so, there may have been cycles of greater\r\nand less abundance of this substance, and an atmosphere rich in carbon\r\ndioxide might at one and the same time afford warmth and abundance of\r\nfood to plants.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the causes of ancient vicissitudes of climate are\r\nsomewhat complex, and when two or more of them happened to coincide very\r\nextreme changes might result, having most important bearings on the\r\ndistribution of plants.\r\n\r\nThis may help us to deal with the peculiarities of the great Glacial age,\r\nwhich may have been rendered exceptionally severe by the combination of\r\nseveral of the causes of refrigeration. We must not suppose, however,\r\nthat the views of those extreme glacialists who suppose continental\r\nice-caps reaching half way to the equator are borne out by facts. In\r\ntruth, the ice accumulating round the pole must have been surrounded by\r\nwater, and there must have been tree-clad islands in the midst of the icy\r\nseas, even in the time of greatest refrigeration. This is proved by the\r\nfact that, in the Leda clay of eastern Canada, which belongs to the time\r\nof greatest submergence, and whose fossil shells show sea-water almost\r\nat the freezing-point, there are leaves of poplars and other plants\r\nwhich must have been drifted from neighbouring shores. Similar remains\r\noccur in clays of like origin in the basin of the great lakes and in the\r\nWest. These have been called \"interglacial,\" but there is no evidence to\r\nprove that they are not truly glacial. Thus, while we need not suppose\r\nthat plants existed within the Arctic circle in the Glacial age, we have\r\nevidence that those of the cold temperate and sub-arctic zones continued\r\nto exist pretty far north. At the same time the warm temperate flora\r\nwould be driven to the south, except where sustained in insular spots\r\nwarmed by the equatorial currents. It would return northward on the\r\nre-elevation of the land and the renewal of warmth.\r\n\r\nIf, however, our modern flora is thus one that has returned from the\r\nsouth, this would account for its poverty in species as compared with\r\nthose of the early Tertiary. Groups of plants descending from the north\r\nhave been rich and varied. Returning from the south they are like the\r\nshattered remains of a beaten army. This, at least, has been the case\r\nwith such retreating floras as those of the Lower Carboniferous, the\r\nPermian, and the Jurassic, and possibly that of the Lower Eocene of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe question of the supply of light to an arctic flora is much less\r\ndifficult than some have imagined. The long summer day is in this respect\r\na good substitute for a longer season of growth, while a copious covering\r\nof winter snow not only protects evergreen plants from those sudden\r\nalternations of temperature which are more destructive than intense\r\nfrost, and prevents the frost from penetrating to their roots, but, by\r\nthe ammonia which it absorbs, preserves their greenness. According to\r\nDr. Brown, the Danish ladies of Disco long ago solved this problem.[FD]\r\nHe informs us that they cultivate in their houses most of our garden\r\nflowers--as roses, fuchsias, and geraniums--showing that it is merely\r\nwarmth and not light that is required to enable a sub-tropical flora to\r\nthrive in Greenland. Even in Canada, which has a flora richer in some\r\nrespects than that of temperate Europe, growth is effectually arrested\r\nby cold for nearly six months, and though there is ample sunlight there\r\nis no vegetation. It is, indeed, not impossible that in the plans of the\r\nCreator the continuous summer sun of the arctic regions may have been\r\nmade the means for the introduction, or at least for the rapid growth and\r\nmultiplication, of new and more varied types of plants.\r\n\r\n[FD] \"Florula Discoana,\" Botanical Society of Edinburgh, 1868.\r\n\r\nMuch, of course, remains to be known of the history of the old floras,\r\nwhose fortunes I have endeavoured to sketch, and which seem to have been\r\ndriven like shuttle-cocks from north to south, and from south to north,\r\nespecially on the American continent, whose meridional extension seems to\r\nhave given a field specially suited for such operations.\r\n\r\nThis great stretch of the western continent, from north to south, is also\r\nconnected with the interesting fact that, when new floras are entering\r\nfrom the arctic regions, they appear earlier in America than in Europe,\r\nand that in times when old floras are retreating from the south old\r\ngenera and species linger longer in America. Thus, in the Devonian and\r\nCretaceous new forms of those periods appear in America long before they\r\nare recognized in Europe, and in the modern epoch forms that would be\r\nregarded in Europe as Miocene still exist. Much confusion in reasoning\r\nas to the geological ages of the fossil floras has arisen from want of\r\nattention to this circumstance.\r\n\r\nWhat we have learned respecting this wonderful history has served\r\nstrangely to change some of our preconceived ideas. We must now be\r\nprepared to admit that an Eden can be planted even in Spitzbergen, that\r\nthere are possibilities in this old earth of ours which its present\r\ncondition does not reveal to us; that the present state of the world is\r\nby no means the best possible in relation to climate and vegetation; that\r\nthere have been and might be again conditions which could convert the\r\nice-clad arctic regions into blooming paradises, and which at the same\r\ntime would moderate the fervent heat of the tropics. We are accustomed to\r\nsay that nothing is impossible with God; but how little have we known of\r\nthe gigantic possibilities which lie hidden under some of the most common\r\nof his natural laws!\r\n\r\nThese facts have naturally been made the occasion of speculations as\r\nto the spontaneous development of plants by processes of varietal\r\nderivation. It would, from this point of view, be a nice question to\r\ncalculate how many revolutions of climate would suffice to evolve the\r\nfirst land-plant; what are the chances that such plant would be so\r\ndealt with by physical changes as to be preserved and nursed into a\r\nmeagre flora like that of the Upper Silurian or the Jurassic; how many\r\ntransportations to Greenland would suffice to promote such meagre flora\r\ninto the rich and abundant forests of the Upper Cretaceous, and to\r\npeople the earth with the exuberant vegetation of the early Tertiary.\r\nSuch problems we may never be able to solve. Probably they admit of no\r\nsolution, unless we invoke the action of an Almighty mind, operating\r\nthrough long ages, and correlating with boundless power and wisdom\r\nall the energies inherent in inorganic and organic nature. Even then\r\nwe shall perhaps be able to comprehend only the means by which, after\r\nspecific types have been created, they may, by the culture of their\r\nMaker, be \"sported\" into new varieties or subspecies, and thus fitted\r\nto exist under different conditions or to occupy higher places in the\r\neconomy of nature.\r\n\r\nBefore venturing on such extreme speculations as some now current on\r\nquestions of this kind, we would require to know the successive extinct\r\nfloras as perfectly as those of the modern world, and to be able to\r\nascertain to what extent each species can change either spontaneously\r\nor under the influence of struggle for existence or expansion under\r\nfavourable conditions, and under arctic semi-annual days and nights, or\r\nthe shorter days of the tropics. Such knowledge, if ever acquired, it may\r\ntake ages of investigation to accumulate.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin and mode of introduction of successive floras, I am, for\r\nthe reasons above stated, not disposed to dogmatise, or to adopt as final\r\nany existing theory of the development of the vegetable kingdom. Still,\r\nsome laws regulating the progress of vegetable life may be recognised,\r\nand I propose to state these in connection with the Palæozoic floras, to\r\nwhich my own studies have chiefly related.\r\n\r\nFossil plants are almost proverbially uncertain with reference to their\r\naccurate determination, and have been regarded as of comparatively little\r\nutility in the decision of general questions of palæontology. This\r\nresults principally from the fragmentary condition in which they have\r\nbeen studied, and from the fact that fragments of animal structures are\r\nmore definite and instructive than corresponding portions of plants.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that our knowledge of fossil plants\r\nbecomes accurate in proportion to the extent to which we can carry the\r\nstudy of specimens in the beds in which they are preserved, so as to\r\nexamine more perfect examples than those usually to be found in museums.\r\nWhen structures are taken into the account, as well as external forms, we\r\ncan also depend more confidently on our results. Further, the abundance\r\nof specimens to be obtained in particular beds often goes far to make up\r\nfor their individual imperfection. The writer of these pages has been\r\nenabled to avail himself very fully of these advantages; and on this\r\naccount, if on no other, feels entitled to speak with some authority on\r\ntheoretical questions.\r\n\r\nIt is an additional encouragement to pursue the subject, that, when\r\nwe can obtain definite information as to the successive floras of any\r\nregion, we thereby learn much as to climate and vicissitudes in regard to\r\nthe extent of land and water; and that, with reference to such points,\r\nthe evidence of fossil plants, when properly studied, is, from the close\r\nrelation of plants to those stations and climates, even more valuable\r\nthan that of animal fossils.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, that in pursuing such inquiries we should have\r\nsome definite views as to the nature and permanence of specific forms,\r\nwhether with reference to a single geological period or to successive\r\nperiods; and I may be excused for stating here some general principles,\r\nwhich I think important for our guidance.\r\n\r\n1. Botanists proceed on the assumption, vindicated by experience, that,\r\nwithin the period of human observation, species have not materially\r\nvaried or passed into each other. We may make, for practical purposes,\r\nthe same assumption with regard to any given geological period, and may\r\nhold that for each such period there are specific types which, for the\r\ntime at least, are invariable.\r\n\r\n2. When we inquire what constitutes a good species for any given period,\r\nwe have reason to believe that many names in our lists represent merely\r\nvarietal forms or erroneous determinations. This is the case even in the\r\nmodern flora; and in fossil floras, through the poverty of specimens,\r\ntheir fragmentary condition, and various states of preservation, it\r\nis still more likely to occur. Every revision of any group of fossils\r\ndetects numerous synonyms, and of these many are incapable of detection\r\nwithout the comparison of large suites of specimens.\r\n\r\n3. We may select from the flora of any geological period certain\r\nforms, which I shall call _specific types_, which may for such period\r\nbe regarded as unchanging. Having settled such types, we may compare\r\nthem with similar forms in other periods, and such comparisons will\r\nnot be vitiated by the uncertainty which arises from the comparison of\r\nso-called species which may, in many cases, be mere varietal forms, as\r\ndistinguished from specific types. Our types may be founded on mere\r\nfragments, provided that these are of such a nature as to prove that they\r\nbelong to distinct forms which cannot pass into each other, at least\r\nwithin the limits of one geological period.\r\n\r\n4. When we compare the specific types of one period with those of another\r\nimmediately precedent or subsequent, we shall find that some continue\r\nunchanged through long intervals of geological time, that others are\r\nrepresented by allied forms regarded either as varietal or specific, and\r\nas derived or otherwise, according to the view which we may entertain as\r\nto the permanence of species. On the other hand, we also find new types\r\nnot rationally deducible on any theory of derivation from those known\r\nin other periods. Further, in comparing the types of a poor period with\r\nthose of one rich in species, we may account for the appearance of new\r\ntypes in the latter by the deficiency of information as to the former;\r\nwhere many new types appear in the poorer period this conclusion seems\r\nless probable. For example, new types appearing in poor formations, like\r\nthe Lower Erian and Lower Carboniferous, have greater significance than\r\nif they appeared in the Middle Erian or in the Coal Measures.\r\n\r\n5. When specific types disappear without any known successors, under\r\ncircumstances in which it seems unlikely that we should have failed to\r\ndiscover their continuance, we may fairly assume that they have become\r\nextinct, at least locally; and where the field of observation is very\r\nextensive, as in the great coal-fields of Europe and America, we may\r\nesteem such extinction as practically general, at least for the northern\r\nhemisphere. When many specific types become extinct together, or in close\r\nsuccession, we may suppose that such extinction resulted from physical\r\nchanges; but where single types disappear, under circumstances in which\r\nothers of similar habit continue, we may not unreasonably conjecture\r\nthat, as Pictet has argued in the case of animals, such types may have\r\nbeen in their own nature limited in duration, and may have died out\r\nwithout any external cause.\r\n\r\n6. With regard to the _introduction_ of specific types we have not as\r\nyet a sufficient amount of information. Even if we freely admit that\r\nordinary specific forms, as well as mere varieties, may result from\r\nderivation, this by no means excludes the idea of primitive specific\r\ntypes originating in some other way. Just as the chemist, after analysing\r\nall compounds and ascertaining all allotropic forms, arrives at length at\r\ncertain elements not mutually transmutable or derivable, so the botanist\r\nand zoölogist must expect sooner or later to arrive at elementary\r\nspecific types, which, if to be accounted for at all, must be explained\r\non some principle distinct from that of derivation. The position of\r\nmany modern biologists, in presence of this question, may be logically\r\nthe same with that of the ancient alchemists with reference to the\r\nchemical elements, though the fallacy in the case of fossils may be of\r\nmore difficult detection. Our business at present, in the prosecution of\r\npalæobotany, is to discover, if possible, what are elementary or original\r\ntypes, and, having found these, to enquire as to the law of their\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n7. In prosecuting such questions geographical relations must be carefully\r\nconsidered. When the floras of two successive periods have existed in\r\nthe same region, and under circumstances that render it probable that\r\nplants have continued to grow on the same or adjoining areas throughout\r\nthese periods, the comparison becomes direct, and this is the case with\r\nthe Erian and Carboniferous floras in northeastern America. But, when\r\nthe areas of the two formations are widely separated in space as well\r\nas in time, any resemblances of facies that we may observe may have no\r\nconnection whatever with an unbroken continuity of specific types.\r\n\r\nI desire, however, under this head, to affirm my conviction that,\r\nwith reference to the Erian and Carboniferous floras of North America\r\nand of Europe, the doctrine of \"homotaxis,\" as distinct from actual\r\ncontemporaneity, has no place. The succession of formations in the\r\nPalæozoic period evidences a similar series of physical phenomena on the\r\ngrandest scale throughout the northern hemisphere. The succession of\r\nmarine animals implies the continuity of the sea-bottoms on which they\r\nlived. The headquarters of the Erian flora in America and Europe must\r\nhave been in connected or adjoining areas in the North Atlantic. The\r\nsimilarity of the Carboniferous flora on the two sides of the Atlantic,\r\nand the great number of identical species, proves a still closer\r\nconnection in that period. These coincidences are too extensive and too\r\nfrequently repeated to be the result of any accident of similar sequence\r\nat different times, and this more especially as they extend to the more\r\nminute differences in the features of each period, as, for instance, the\r\nfloras of the Lower and Upper Devonian, and of the Lower, Middle, and\r\nUpper Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n8. Another geographical question is that which relates to centres of\r\ndispersion. In times of slow subsidence of extensive areas, the plants\r\ninhabiting such areas must be narrowed in their range and often separated\r\nfrom one another in detached spots, while, at the same time, important\r\nclimatal changes must also occur. On the re-emergence of the land such\r\nof these species as remained would again extend themselves over their\r\nformer areas of distribution, in so far as the new climatal and other\r\nconditions would permit. We would naturally suppose that the first of\r\nthe above processes would tend to the elimination of varieties, the\r\nsecond, to their increase; but, on the other I hand, the breaking up of a\r\ncontinental flora into that of distinct islets, and the crowding together\r\nof many forms, might be a process fertile in the production of some\r\nvarieties if fatal to others.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is possible that these changes of subsidence may have some\r\nconnection with the introduction, as well as with the extinction, even of\r\nspecific types. It is certain, at least, in the case of land-plants, that\r\nsuch types come in most plentifully immediately after elevation, though\r\nthey are most abundantly preserved in periods of slow subsidence. I do\r\nnot mean, however, that this connection is one of cause and effect; there\r\nare, indeed, indications that it is not so. One of these is, that in some\r\ncases the enlargement of the area of the land seems to be as injurious to\r\nterrestrial species as its diminution.\r\n\r\n9. Another point on which I have already insisted, and which has been\r\nfound to apply to the Tertiary as well as to the Palæozoic floras, is the\r\nappearance of new types within the arctic and boreal areas, and their\r\nmigration southward. Periods in which the existence of northern land\r\ncoincided with a general warm temperature of the northern hemisphere seem\r\nto have been those most favourable to the introduction of new forms of\r\nland-plants. Hence, there has been throughout geological time a general\r\nmovement of new floras from the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions to the\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nApplying the above considerations to the Erian and Carboniferous floras\r\nof North America, we obtain some data which may guide us in arriving at\r\ngeneral conclusions. The Erian flora is comparatively poor, and its\r\ntypes are in the main similar to those of the Carboniferous. Of these\r\ntypes a few only reappear in the middle coal-formation under identical\r\nforms; a great number appear under allied forms; some altogether\r\ndisappear. The Erian flora of New Brunswick and Maine occurs side by\r\nside with the Carboniferous of the same region; so does the Erian of New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania with the Carboniferous of those States. Thus we\r\nhave data for the comparison of successive floras in the same region. In\r\nthe Canadian region we have, indeed, in direct sequence, the floras of\r\nthe Upper Silurian, the Lower, Middle, and Upper Erian, and the Lower,\r\nMiddle, and Upper Carboniferous, all more or less distinct from each\r\nother, and affording an admirable series for comparison in a region whose\r\ngeographical features are very broadly marked. All these floras are\r\ncomposed in great part of similar types, and probably do not indicate\r\nvery dissimilar general physical conditions, but they are separated from\r\neach other by the great subsidences of the Corniferous limestone and the\r\nLower Carboniferous limestone, and by the local but intense subterranean\r\naction which has altered and disturbed the Erian beds toward the close\r\nof that period. Still, these changes were not universal. The Corniferous\r\nlimestone is absent in Gaspé, and probably in New Brunswick, where,\r\nconsequently, the Erian flora could continue undisturbed during that long\r\nperiod. The Carboniferous limestone is absent from the slopes of the\r\nAppalachians in Pennsylvania, where a retreat may have been afforded to\r\nthe Upper Erian and Lower Carboniferous floras. The disturbances at the\r\nclose of the Erian were limited to those eastern regions where the great\r\nlimestone-producing subsidences were unfelt, and, on the other hand, are\r\nabsent in Ohio, where the subsidences and marine conditions were almost\r\nat a maximum.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind these peculiarities of the area in question, we may now\r\ngroup in a tabular form the distinct specific types recognised in the\r\nErian system, indicating, at the same time, those which are represented\r\nby identical species in the Carboniferous, those represented by similar\r\nspecies of the same general type, and those not represented at all.\r\nFor example, _Calamites cannæformis_ extends as a species into the\r\nCarboniferous; _Asterophyllites latifolia_ does not so extend, but is\r\nrepresented by closely allied species of the same type; _Nematophyton_\r\ndisappears altogether before we reach the Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n_Table of Erian and Carboniferous Specific Types._\r\n\r\n    Erian types.

Of these only four reappear in the Carboniferous under identical\r\nspecies, but no less than twenty-six reappear under representative or\r\nallied forms, some at least of which a derivationist might claim as\r\nmodified descendants. On the other hand, nearly one half of the Devonian\r\ntypes are unknown in the Carboniferous, while there remain a very large\r\nnumber of Carboniferous types not accounted for by anything known in\r\nthe Devonian. Further, a very poor flora, including only two or three\r\ntypes, is the predecessor of the Erian flora in the Upper Silurian,\r\nand the flora again becomes poor in the Upper Devonian and Lower\r\nCarboniferous. Every new species discovered must more or less modify the\r\nabove statements, and the whole Erian flora of America, as well as the\r\nCarboniferous, requires a thorough comparison with that of Europe before\r\ngeneral conclusions can be safely drawn. In the mean time I may indicate\r\nthe direction in which the facts seem to point by the following general\r\nstatements:\r\n\r\n1. Some of the forms reckoned as specific in the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous may be really derivative races. There are indications that\r\nsuch races may have originated in one or more of the following ways: (1)\r\nBy a natural tendency in synthetic types to become specialised in the\r\ndirection of one or other of their constituent elements. In this way\r\nsuch plants as _Arthrostigma_ and _Psilophyton_ may have assumed new\r\nvarietal forms. (2) By embryonic retardation or acceleration,[FE] whereby\r\ncertain species may have had their maturity advanced or postponed, thus\r\ngiving them various grades of perfection in reproduction and complexity\r\nof structure. The fact that so many Erian and Carboniferous plants seem\r\nto be on the confines of the groups of Acrogens and Gymnosperms may be\r\nsupposed favourable to such exchanges. (3) The contraction and breaking\r\nup of floras, as occurred in the Middle Erian and Lower Carboniferous,\r\nmay have been eminently favourable to the production of such varietal\r\nforms as would result from what has been called the \"struggle for\r\nexistence.\" (4) The elevation of a great expanse of new land at the\r\nclose of the Middle Erian and the beginning of the coal period would, by\r\npermitting the extension of species over wide areas and fertile soils,\r\nand by removing the pressure previously existing, be eminently favourable\r\nto the production of new, and especially of improved, varieties.\r\n\r\n[FE] In the manner illustrated by Hyatt and Cope.\r\n\r\n2. Whatever importance we may attach to the above supposed causes of\r\nchange, we still require to account for the origin of our specific\r\ntypes. This may forever elude our observation, but we may at least hope\r\nto ascertain the external conditions favourable to their production. In\r\norder to attain even to this it will be necessary to inquire critically,\r\nwith reference to every acknowledged species, what its claims to\r\ndistinctness are, so that we may be enabled to distinguish specific types\r\nfrom mere varieties. Having attained to some certainty in this, we may be\r\nprepared to inquire whether the conditions favourable to the appearance\r\nof new varieties were also those favourable to the creation of new types,\r\nor the reverse--whether these conditions were those of compression\r\nor expansion, or to what extent the appearance of new types may be\r\nindependent of any external conditions, other than those absolutely\r\nnecessary for their existence. I am not without hope that the further\r\nstudy of fossil plants may enable us thus to approach to a comprehension\r\nof the laws of the creation, as distinguished from those of the continued\r\nexistence of species.\r\n\r\n3. In the present state of our knowledge we have no good ground either\r\nto limit the number of specific types beyond what a fair study of\r\nour material may warrant, or to infer that such primitive types must\r\nnecessarily have been of low grade, or that progress in varietal\r\nforms has always been upward. The occurrence of such an advanced and\r\nspecialised type as that of _Dadoxylon_ in the Middle Devonian should\r\nguard us against these errors. The creative process may have been\r\napplicable to the highest as well as to the lowest forms, and subsequent\r\ndeviations must have included degradation as well as elevation. I can\r\nconceive nothing more unreasonable than the statement sometimes made that\r\nit is illogical or even absurd to suppose that highly organised beings\r\ncould have been produced except by derivation from previously existing\r\norganisms. This is begging the whole question at issue, depriving science\r\nof a noble department of inquiry on which it has as yet barely entered,\r\nand anticipating by unwarranted assertions conclusions which may perhaps\r\nsuddenly dawn upon us through the inspiration of some great intellect,\r\nor may for generations to come baffle the united exertions of all the\r\nearnest promoters of natural science. Our present attitude should not be\r\nthat of dogmatists, but that of patient workers content to labour for a\r\nharvest of grand generalisations which may not come till we have passed\r\naway, but which, if we are earnest and true to Nature and its Creator,\r\nmay reward even some of us.\r\n\r\nWithin the human period great changes of distribution of plants have\r\noccurred, chiefly through the agency of man himself, and we have\r\nhad ample evidence that plants are able to establish themselves and\r\nprosper in climates and conditions to which unaided they could not have\r\ntransported themselves, as, for instance, in the case of European weeds\r\nnaturalised in Australia and New Zealand. There is, however, no reason\r\nto believe that any specific change has occurred to any plant within the\r\nPleistocene or modern period.\r\n\r\nIn a recent address, delivered to the biological section of the British\r\nAssociation, Mr. Carruthers has discussed this question, and has shown\r\nthat the earliest vegetable specimens described by Dr. Schweinfurth from\r\nthe Egyptian tombs present no appearance of change. This fact appears\r\nalso in the leaves and other organs of plants preserved in the nodules\r\nin the Pleistocene clays of the Ottawa, and in specimens of similar age\r\nfound in various places in Britain and the continent of Europe.[FF]\r\n\r\n[FF] \"Proceedings British Association,\" 1886, \"Pleistocene Plants of\r\nCanada,\" Canadian Naturalist, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties attending the ordinary theories of evolution as applied\r\nto plants have been well set forth by the same able botanist in his\r\n\"Presidential Address to the Geological Association in 1877,\" a paper\r\nwhich deserves careful study. One of his illustrations is that ancient\r\nwillow, _Salix polaris_, referred to in a previous chapter, which now\r\nlives in the arctic regions, and is found fossil in the Pleistocene beds\r\nat Cromer and at Bovey Tracey.\r\n\r\nHe notes the fact that the genus _Salix_ is a very variable one,\r\nincluding 19 subgeneric groups and 160 species, with no less than 222\r\nvarieties and 70 hybrids. _Salix polaris_ belongs to a subgeneric group\r\ncontaining 29 species, which are arranged in four sections, that to which\r\n_S. polaris_ belongs containing six species. Now it is easy to construct\r\na theoretical phylogeny of the derivation of the willows from a supposed\r\nancestral source, but when we take our little _S. polaris_ we find\r\nthat this one twig of our ancestral tree takes us back without change\r\nto the Glacial period. The six species would take us still farther,\r\nand the sections, sub-genera, and genus at the same rate would require\r\nan incalculable amount of past time. He concludes the inquiry in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\"But when we have reached the branch representing the generic form we\r\nhave made but little progress in the phylogenesis of _Salix_. With\r\n_Populus_ this genus forms a small order, Salicineæ, The two genera are\r\nclosely allied, yet separated by well-marked characters; it is not,\r\nhowever, difficult to conceive of both having sprung from a generalised\r\nform. But there is no record of such a form. The two genera appear\r\ntogether among the earliest known dicotyledons, the willows being\r\nrepresented by six and the poplars by nine species. The ordinal form, if\r\nit ever existed, must necessarily be much older than the period of the\r\nUpper Cretaceous rocks, that is, than the period to which the earliest\r\nknown dicotyledons belong.\r\n\r\n\"The Salicineæ are related to five other natural orders, in all of which\r\nthe apetalous flowers are arranged in catkins. These different though\r\nallied orders must be led up by small modifications to a generalised\r\namentiferous type, and thereafter the various groups of apetalous\r\nplants by innumerable eliminations of differentiating characters until\r\nthe primitive form of the apetalous plant is reached. Beyond this the\r\nuncurbed imagination will have more active work in bridging over the gap\r\nbetween Angiosperms and Gymnosperms, in finding the intermediate forms\r\nthat led up to the vascular cryptogams, and on through the cellular\r\nplants to the primordial germ. Every step in this phylogenetic tree\r\nmust be imagined. The earliest dicotyledon takes us not a step farther\r\nback in the phylogenetic history of _Salix_ than that supplied by\r\nexisting vegetation. All beyond the testimony of our living willows is\r\npure imagination, unsupported by a single fact. So that here, also, the\r\nevidence is against evolution, and there is none in favour of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that similar difficulties beset every attempt to trace\r\nthe development of plants on the principle of slow and gradual evolution,\r\nand we are driven back on the theory of periods of rapid origin, as we\r\nhave already seen suggested by Saporta in the case of the Cretaceous\r\ndicotyledons. Such abrupt and plentiful introduction of species over\r\nlarge areas at the same time, by whatever cause effected--and we are\r\nat present quite ignorant of any secondary causes--becomes in effect\r\nsomething not unlike the old and familiar idea of creation. Science\r\nmust indeed always be baffled by questions of ultimate origin, and,\r\nhowever far it may be able to trace the chain of secondary causation\r\nand development, must at length find itself in the presence of the\r\ngreat Creative Mind, who is \"before all things and in whom all things\r\nconsist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.--COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE SUCCESSIVE PALÆOZOIC\r\n  FLORAS OF NORTHEASTERN AMERICA AND\r\n  GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nIn eastern Canada there is a very complete series of fossil plants,\r\nextending from the Silurian to the Permian, and intermediate in its\r\nspecies between the floras of interior America and of Europe. I may\r\nuse this succession, mainly worked out by myself,[FG] to summarise the\r\nvarious Palæozoic floras and sub-floras, in order to give a condensed\r\nview of this portion of the history of the vegetable kingdom, and to\r\ndirect attention to the important fact, too often overlooked, that there\r\nis a definite succession of fossil plants as well as of animals, and\r\nthat this is important as a means of determining geological horizons.\r\nA British list for comparison has been kindly prepared for me by Mr.\r\nR. Kidston, F. Gr. S. For lists referring to the western and southern\r\nportions of America, I may refer to the reports of Lesquereux and\r\nFontaine and White.[FH]\r\n\r\n[FG] \"Acadian Geology,\" \"Reports on Fossil Plants of Canada,\" Geological\r\nSurvey of Canada.\r\n\r\n[FH] \"Geological Surveys of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Illinois.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection I am reminded, by an excellent little paper of M.\r\nZeiller,[FI] on Carboniferous plants from the region of the Zambesi,\r\nin Africa, that the flora which in the Carboniferous period extended\r\nover the temperate portions of the northern hemisphere and far into the\r\narctic, also passed across the equator and prevailed in the southern\r\nhemisphere. Of eleven species brought from the Zambesi by M. Lapierre\r\nand examined by M. Zeiller, all were identical with European species\r\nof the upper coal-formation, and the same fact has been observed in the\r\ncoal flora of the Cape Colony.[FJ] These facts bear testimony to the\r\nremarkable uniformity of climate and vegetation in the coal period, and\r\nI perfectly agree with Zeiller that they show, when taken in connection\r\nwith other parallelisms in fossils, an actual contemporaneousness of the\r\ncoal flora over the whole world.\r\n\r\n[FI] Paris, 1883.\r\n\r\n[FJ] Grey, \"Journal of the Geological Society,\" vol. xxvii.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Carboniferous Flora.\r\n\r\n(1) _Permo-Carboniferous Sub-Flora_:\r\n\r\nThis occurs in the upper member of the Carboniferous system of Nova\r\nScotia and Prince Edward Island, originally named by the writer the\r\nNewer Coal-formation, and more recently the Permo-Carboniferous, and\r\nthe upper beds of which may not improbably be contemporaneous with the\r\nLower Permian or Lower Dyas of Europe. In this formation there is a\r\npredominance of red sandstones and shales, and it contains no productive\r\nbeds of coal. Its fossil plants are for the most part of species found\r\nin the Middle or Productive Coal-formation, but are less numerous, and\r\nthere are a few new forms akin to those of the European Permian. The most\r\ncharacteristic species of the upper portion of the formation, which has\r\nthe most decidedly Permian aspect, are the following:\r\n\r\n    _Dadoxylon materiarium_, Dawson.\r\n  * _Walchia_ (_Araucarites_) _robusta_, Dn.\r\n  * _W._ (_A._) _gracilis_, Dn.\r\n  * _W. imbricatula_, Dn.\r\n    _Calamites Suckovii_, Brongt.\r\n    _C. Cistii_, Brongt.\r\n  * _C. gigas_, Brongt.\r\n    _Neuropteris rarinervis_, Bunbury.\r\n    _Alethopteris nervosa_, Brongt.\r\n    _Pecopteris arborescens_, Brongt.\r\n  * _P. rigida_, Dn.\r\n    _P. oreopteroides_, Brongt.\r\n  * _Cordaites simplex_, Dn.\r\n\r\nOf these species, those marked with an asterisk have not yet been found\r\nin the middle or lower members of the Carboniferous system. They will\r\nbe found described, and several of them figured, in my \"Report on the\r\nGeology of Prince Edward Island.\"[FK] The others are common and widely\r\ndiffused Carboniferous species, some of which have extended to the\r\nPermian period in Europe as well. From the upper beds, characterised by\r\nthese and a few other species, there is a gradual passage downward into\r\nthe productive coal-measures, and a gradually increasing number of true\r\ncoal-formation species.\r\n\r\n[FK] 1871.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark here that the association in the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous of numerous trunks of _Dadoxylon_ with the branches\r\nof _Walchia_ and with fruits of the character of _Trigonocarpa_, seems to\r\nshow that these were parts of one and the same plant.\r\n\r\nThis formation represents the Upper Barren Measures of West Virginia,\r\nwhich are well described by Fontaine and White,[FL] and the reasons\r\nwhich these authors adduce for considering the latter equivalent to the\r\nEuropean Permian will apply to the more northern and eastern deposits\r\nas well, though these have afforded fewer species of plants, and are\r\napparently less fully developed.\r\n\r\n[FL] \"Report on the Permian Flora of Western Virginia and South\r\nPennsylvania,\" 1880.\r\n\r\n(2) _Coal-formation Sub-Flora_:\r\n\r\nThe Middle or Productive Coal-formation, containing all the beds of coal\r\nwhich are mined in Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, is the headquarters of\r\nthe Carboniferous flora. From this formation I have catalogued[FM] one\r\nhundred and thirty-five species of plants; but, as several of these are\r\nfounded on imperfect specimens, the number of actual species may be\r\nestimated at one hundred and twenty. Of these more than one half are\r\nspecies common to Europe and America. No less than nineteen species\r\nare _Sigillariæ_, and about the same number are _Lepidodendra_. About\r\nfifty are ferns and thirteen are _Calamites_, _Asterophyllites_, and\r\n_Sphenophylla_. The great abundance and number of species of Sigillariæ,\r\nLepidodendra, and ferns are characteristic of this sub-flora; and among\r\nthe ferns certain species of _Neuropteris_, _Pecopteris_, _Alethopteris_,\r\nand _Sphenopteris_ greatly preponderate.\r\n\r\n[FM] \"Acadian Geology,\" and \"Report on Flora of Lower Carboniferous,\"\r\n1873.\r\n\r\nThese beds are the equivalents of the Middle Coal-measures, or Productive\r\nCoal-measures of Pennsylvania, Ohio, &c., and of the coal-formation\r\nproper of various European countries. Very many of the species are common\r\nto Nova Scotia and Pennsylvania; but in proceeding westward the number of\r\nidentical species seems to diminish.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Millstone Grit Sub-Flora_:\r\n\r\nIn this formation the abundance of plants and the number of species\r\nare greatly diminished.[FN] Trunks of coniferous trees of the species\r\n_Dadoxylon Acadianum_, having wide wood-cells with three or more series\r\nof discs and complex medullary rays, become characteristic. _Calamites\r\nundulatum_ is abundant and seems to replace _C. Suckovii_, though _C.\r\ncannæformis_ and _C. cistii_ continue. _Sigillariæ_ become very rare,\r\nand the species of Lepidodendron are few, and mostly those with large\r\nleaf-bases. _Lepidophloios_ still continues, and _Cordaites_ abounds in\r\nsome beds. The ferns are greatly reduced, though a few characteristic\r\ncoal-formation species occur, and the genus _Cardiopteris_ appears. Beds\r\nof coal are rare in this formation; but where they occur there is in\r\nconnection with them a remarkable anticipation of the rich coal-formation\r\nflora, which would thus seem to have existed locally in the Millstone\r\nGrit period, but to have found itself limited by generally unfavorable\r\nconditions. In America, as in Europe, it is in the north that this\r\nearlier development of the coal-flora occurs, while in the south there\r\nis a lingering of old forms in the newer beds. In Newfoundland and Cape\r\nBreton, for instance, as well as in Scotland, productive coal-beds and a\r\ngreater variety of species of plants occur in this formation.\r\n\r\n[FN] \"Report on Fossil Plants of the Lower Carboniferous and Millstone\r\nGrit of Canada,\" 1873.\r\n\r\nThe following would appear to be the equivalents of this formation, in\r\nflora and geological position:\r\n\r\n1.

The Jüngste Grauwacke of the Hartz, Saxony, and Silesia.\r\n\r\n(4) _The Carboniferous Limestone Series_:\r\n\r\nThis affords few fossil plants in eastern America, and in so far as known\r\nthey are similar to those of the next group. In Scotland it is richer\r\nin plants, but, according to Mr. Kidston, these are largely similar\r\nto those of the underlying beds, though with some species which extend\r\nupward into the Millstone Grit. In Scotland the alga named _Spirophyton_\r\nand _Archæocalamites radiatus_--which in America are Erian--appear in\r\nthis formation.\r\n\r\n(5) _The Lower Carboniferous Sub-Flora_:\r\n\r\nThis group of plants is best seen in the shales of the Horton series,\r\nunder the Lower Carboniferous marine limestones. It is small and\r\npeculiar. The most characteristic species are the following:\r\n\r\n_Dadoxylon_ (_Palæoxylon_) _antiquius_, Dn.--A species with large\r\nmedullary rays of three or more series of cells.\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron corrugatum_, Dn.--A species closely allied to _L.\r\nVeltheimianum_ of Europe, and which is its American representative.\r\nThis is perhaps the most characteristic plant of the formation. It is\r\nvery abundant, and presents very protean appearances, in its old stems,\r\nbranches, twigs, and _Knorria_ forms. It had well-characterised stigmaria\r\nroots, and constitutes the oldest erect forest known in Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron tetragonum_, Sternberg.\r\n\r\n_L. obovatum_, Sternb.\r\n\r\n_L. aculeatum_, Sternb.\r\n\r\n_L. dichotomum_, Sternb.\r\n\r\nThe four species last mentioned are comparatively rare, and the specimens\r\nare usually too imperfect to render their identification certain, but\r\nLepidodendra are especially characteristic trees of this horizon.\r\n\r\n_Cyclopteris_ (_Aneimites_) _Acadica_, Dn.--A very characteristic\r\nfern, allied in the form of its fronds to _C. tenuifolia_ of Goeppert,\r\nto _C. nana_ of Eichwald, and to _Adiantites antiquus_ of Stur. Its\r\nfructification, however, is nearer to that of _Aneimia_ than to that of\r\n_Adiantum_.\r\n\r\nFerns of the genera Cardiopteris and _Hymenophyllites_ also occur, though\r\nrarely.\r\n\r\n_Ptilophyton plumula_, Dn.--This is the latest appearance of this Erian\r\ngenus, which also occurs in the Lower Carboniferous of Europe and of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n_Cordaites borassifolia_, Brongt.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, this small flora is markedly distinct from that of the\r\nMillstone Grit and true coal-formation, from which it is separated by the\r\ngreat length of time required for the deposition of the marine limestones\r\nand their associated beds, in which no land-plants have been found; nor\r\nis this gap filled up by the conglomerates and coarse arenaceous beds\r\nwhich, as I have explained in \"Acadian Geology,\" in some localities take\r\nthe place of the limestones, as they do also in the Appalachian region\r\nfarther south.\r\n\r\nThe palæobotanical and stratigraphical equivalents of this series abroad\r\nwould seem to be the following:\r\n\r\n1. The Vespertine group of Rogers in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n2. The Kinderhook group of Worthen in Illinois.\r\n\r\n3. The Marshall group of Winchell in Michigan.\r\n\r\n4. The Waverley sandstone (in part) of Ohio.\r\n\r\n5. The Lower or False Coal-measures of Virginia.\r\n\r\n6. The Calciferous sandstones of McLaren, or Tweedian group of Tate in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n7. The Lower Carboniferous slate and Coomhala grits of Jukes in Ireland.\r\n\r\n8. The Culm and Culm Grauwacke of Germany.\r\n\r\n9. The Graywacke or Lower Coal-measures of the Vosges, as described by\r\nSchimper.\r\n\r\n10. The Older Coal-formation of the Ural, as described by Eichwald.\r\n\r\n11. The so-called \"Ursa Stage\" of Heer includes this, but he has united\r\nit with Devonian beds, so that the name cannot be used except for\r\nthe local development of these beds at Bear Island, Spitsbergen. The\r\nCarboniferous plants of arctic America, Melville Island, &c., as well as\r\nthose of Spitzbergen, appear all to be Lower Carboniferous.[FO]\r\n\r\n[FO] \"Notes on Geological Map of the Northern Portion of the Dominion of\r\nCanada,\" by Dr. G. M. Dawson, 1887.\r\n\r\nAll of the above groups of rocks are characterised by the prevalence of\r\n_Lepidodendra_ of the type of _L. corrugatum_, _L. Veltheimianum_, and\r\n_L. Glincanum_; pines of the sub-genus _Pitus_ of Witham, _Palæoxylon_\r\nof Brongniart, and peculiar ferns of the genera _Cyclopteris_,\r\n_Cardiopteris_, _Triphyllopteris_, and _Sphenopteris_. In all the regions\r\nabove referred to they form the natural base of the great Carboniferous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, according to Fontaine and White, types, such as\r\nArchæopteris, which in the north are Upper Erian, occur in this group.\r\nUnless there have been some errors in fixing the lower limit of the\r\nVespertine, this would indicate a longer continuance of old forms in the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n2. Erian Flora.\r\n\r\n(1) _Upper Erian Sub-Flora_:\r\n\r\nThis corresponds to the Catskill and Chemung of the New York series, and\r\nto the Upper Devonian of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe flora of this formation, which consists mostly of sandstones, is not\r\nrich. Its most distinctive species on both sides of the Atlantic seem to\r\nbe the ferns of the genus _Archæopteris_, along with species referred to\r\nthe genus _Cyclopteris_, but which, in so far as their barren fronds are\r\nconcerned, for the most part resemble _Archæopteris_.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic American species are _Archæopteris Jacksoni_,\r\n_A. Rogersi_, and _A. Gaspiensis_. _Cyclopteris obtusa_ and _C._\r\n(_Platyphyllum_) _Brownii_ are also very characteristic species. In\r\nEurope, _Archæopteris Hibernica_ is a prevalent species.\r\n\r\n_Leptophleum rhombicum_ and fragments of _Psilophyton_ are also found in\r\nthe Upper Erian. There is evidence of the existence of vast numbers of\r\n_Rhizocarps_ in this period, in the deposits of spore-cases (_Sporangites\r\nHuronensis_) in the shales of Kettle Point, Lake Huron; and in deposits\r\nof similar character in Ohio and elsewhere in the West.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Erian flora is thus very distinct from that of the Lower\r\nCarboniferous, and the unconformable relation of the beds in the\r\nNortheast may perhaps indicate a considerable lapse of time. Still,\r\neven in localities where there appears to be a transition from the\r\nCarboniferous into the Devonian, as in the Western States and in Ireland,\r\nthe characteristic flora of each formation may be distinguished, though,\r\nas already stated, there is apparently some mixture in the South.\r\n\r\n(2) _Middle Erian Sub-Flora_:\r\n\r\nBoth in Canada and the United States that part of the great Erian system\r\nwhich may be regarded as its middle division, the Hamilton and Marcellus\r\nshales of New York, the Cordaites shales of St. John, New Brunswick, and\r\nthe middle shales and sandstones of the Gaspé series, presents conditions\r\nmore favourable to the abundant growth of land-plants than either the\r\nupper or lower member. In the St. John beds, in particular, there is a\r\nrich fern flora, comparable with that of the coal-formation, and numerous\r\nstipes of ferns and trunks of tree-ferns have been found in the Hamilton\r\nand Corniferous series in the West, as well as trunks of _Dadoxylon_. It\r\nis, however, distinguished by a prevalence of small and delicate species,\r\nand by such forms as _Hymenophyllites_ and the smaller Sphenopterids, and\r\nalso by some peculiar ferns, as _Archæopteris_ and _Megalopteris_. In\r\naddition to ferns, it has small _Lepidodendra_, of which _L. Gaspianum_\r\nis the chief. _Calamiteæ_ occur, _Archæocalamites radiatus_ being the\r\ndominant species. This plant, which in Europe appears to reach up into\r\nthe Lower Carboniferous, is so far strictly Erian in northeast America.\r\n_Sigillariæ_ scarcely appear, but _Cordaites_ is abundant, and the\r\nearliest known species of _Dadoxylon_ appear, while the Psilophyton, so\r\ncharacteristic of the Lower Erian, still continues, and the remarkable\r\naquatic plants of the genus _Ptilophyton_ are locally abundant.\r\n\r\n(3) _Lower Erian Sub-Flora_:\r\n\r\nThis belongs to the Lower Devonian sandstones and shales, and is\r\nbest seen in that formation at Gaspé and the Bay des Chaleurs. It is\r\nequivalent to the Oriskany sandstone, so far as its animal fossils and\r\nmineral character are concerned. It is characterised by the absence\r\nof true ferns, _Calamites_ and _Sigillariæ_, and by the presence\r\nof such forms as _Psilophyton_, _Arthrostigma_, _Leptophleum_, and\r\n_Nematophyton_. _Lepidodendron Gaspianum_ and _Leptophleum_ already\r\noccur, though not nearly so abundant as Psilophyton.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Erian plants have an antique and generalised aspect which would\r\nlead us to infer that they are near the beginning of the land-flora, or\r\nperhaps in part belong to the close of an earlier flora still in great\r\npart unknown and few indications of land-plants have been found earlier.\r\n\r\nAt Campbellton and Scaumenac Bay, on the Bay des Chaleurs, fossil fishes\r\nof genera characteristic of the Lower and Upper Devonian horizons\r\nrespectively, occur in association with fossil plants of these horizons,\r\nand have been described by Mr. Whiteaves.[FP]\r\n\r\n[FP] \"Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that, as Fontaine and White have observed,\r\ncertain forms which are Erian in the northeast are found in the Lower\r\nmembers of the Carboniferous in West Virginia, indicating the southward\r\nmarch of species in these periods.\r\n\r\n3. The Silurian Flora and still Earlier Indications of Plants.\r\n\r\nIn the upper beds of the Silurian, those of the Helderberg series, we\r\nstill find _Psilophyton_ and _Nematophyton_; but below these we know no\r\nland-plants in Canada. In the United States, Lesquereux and Claypole have\r\ndescribed remains which may indicate the existence of lycopodiaceous and\r\nannularian types as far back as the beginning of the Upper Silurian, or\r\neven as low as the Hudson River group, and Hicks has found _Nematophyton_\r\nand _Psilophyton_ in beds about as old in Wales, along with the uncertain\r\nstems named _Berwynia_. In the Lower Silurian the _Protannularia_ of\r\nthe Skiddaw series in England may represent a land-plant, but this is\r\nuncertain, and no similar species has been found in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian rocks are so far barren of land-plants; the so-called\r\n_Eophyton_ being evidently nothing but markings, probably produced by\r\ncrustaceans and other aquatic animals. In the still older Laurentian the\r\nabundant beds of graphite probably indicate the existence of plants, but\r\nwhether aquatic or terrestrial it is impossible to decide at present.\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that our certain knowledge of land-vegetation begins\r\nwith the Upper Silurian or the Silurio-Cambrian, and that its earliest\r\nforms were Acrogens allied to Lycopods, and prototypal trees, forerunners\r\nof the Acrogens or the gymnosperms. In the Lower Devonian little advance\r\nis made. In the Middle Devonian this meagre flora had been replaced by\r\none rivalling that of the Carboniferous, and including pines, tree-ferns,\r\nand arboreal forms of Lycopods and of equisetaceous plants, as well as\r\nnumerous herbaceous plants. At the close of the Erian the flora again\r\nbecame meagre, and continued so in the Lower Carboniferous. It again\r\nbecame rich and varied in the Middle Carboniferous, to decay in the\r\nsucceeding Permian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--HEER'S LATEST RESULTS IN THE GREENLAND FLORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very valuable report of Prof. Steenstrup, published in Copenhagen in\r\n1883, the year in which Heer died, contains the results of his last\r\nwork on the Greenland plants, and is so important that a summary of its\r\ncontents will be interesting to all students of fossil botany or of the\r\nvicissitudes of climate which the earth has undergone.[FQ]\r\n\r\n[FQ] Meddelelser om Gronland, Hefte V., Copenhagen, 1883.\r\n\r\nThe plant-bearing beds of Greenland are as follows, in ascending order:\r\n\r\n1. Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n1. The _Komé_ series, of black shales resting on the Laurentian gneiss.\r\nThese beds are found at various other localities, but the name above\r\ngiven is that by which they are generally known. Their flora is limited\r\nto ferns, cycads, conifers, and a few endogens, with only _Populus\r\nprimæva_ to represent the dicotyledons. These beds are regarded as Lower\r\nCretaceous (Urgonian), but the animal fossils would seem to give them\r\na rather higher position. They may be regarded as equivalent to the\r\nKootanie and Queen Charlotte beds in Canada, and the Potomac series in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n2. The _Atané_ series. These also are black shales with dark-coloured\r\nsandstones. They are best exposed at Upernavik and Waigat. Here\r\ndicotyledonous leaves abound, amounting to ninety species, or more than\r\nhalf the whole number of species found. The fossil plants resemble those\r\nof the Dakota series of the United States and the Dunvegan series of\r\nCanada, and the animal fossils indicate the horizon of the Fort Pierre or\r\nits lower part. They may be regarded as representing the lower part of\r\nthe Upper Cretaceous. The genera _Populus_, _Myrica_, _Quercus_, _Ficus_,\r\n_Platanus_, _Sassafras_, _Laurus_, _Magnolia_, and _Liriodendron_\r\nare among those represented in these beds, and the peculiar genera\r\n_Macclintockia_ and _Credneria_ are characteristic. The genus _Pinus_ is\r\nrepresented by five species, _Sequoia_ by five, and _Salisburia_ by two,\r\nwith three of the allied genus _Baiera_. There are many ferns and cycads.\r\n\r\n3. The _Patoot_ series. These are yellow and red shales, which seem to\r\nowe their colour to the spontaneous combustion of pyritous lignite, in\r\nthe manner observed on the South Saskatchewan and the Mackenzie rivers.\r\nTheir age is probably about that of the Fox-Hill group or Senonian,\r\nand the Upper Cretaceous of Vancouver Island, and they afford a large\r\nproportion of dicotyledonous leaves. The genera of dicotyledons are\r\nnot dissimilar from those of Atané, but we now recognise _Betula_ and\r\n_Alnus_, _Comptonia_, _Planera_, _Sapotacites_, _Fraxinus_, _Viburnum_,\r\n_Cornus_, _Acer_, _Celastrus_, _Paliurus_, _Ceanothus_, _Zizyphus_, and\r\n_Cratægus_ as new genera of modern aspect.\r\n\r\nOn the whole there have been found in all these beds 335 species,\r\nbelonging to 60 families, of which 36 are dicotyledonous, and represent\r\nall the leading types of arborescent dicotyledons of the temperate\r\nlatitudes. The flora is a warm temperate one, with some remarkable\r\nmixtures of sub-tropical forms, among which perhaps the most remarkable\r\nare _Kaidocarpum_ referred to the _Pandaneæ_, and such exogens as _Ficus_\r\nand _Cinnamomum_.\r\n\r\n2. Tertiary.\r\n\r\n4. The _Unartok_ series. This is believed to be Eocene. It consists of\r\nsandstone, which appears on the shores of Disco Island, and possibly at\r\nsome other places on the coast. The beds rest directly and apparently\r\nconformably on the Upper Cretaceous, and have afforded only eleven\r\nspecies of plants. _Magnolia_ is represented by two species, _Laurus_\r\nby two, _Platanus_ by two, and one of these said to be identical with a\r\nspecies found by Lesquereux in the Laramie,[FR] _Viburnum_, _Juglans_,\r\n_Quercus_, each by one species; the ubiquitous _Sequoias_ by _S.\r\nLangsdorfii_. This is pretty clearly a Lower Laramie flora.\r\n\r\n[FR] _Viburnum marginatum_ of Lesquereux.\r\n\r\n5. The _Atanekerdluk_ series, consisting of shaly beds, with limestone\r\nintercalated between great sheets of basalt, much like the Eocene of\r\nAntrim and the Hebrides. These beds have yielded 187 species, principally\r\nin bands and concretions of siderite, and often in a good state of\r\npreservation. They are referred to the Lower Miocene, but, as explained\r\nin the text, the flora is more nearly akin to that of the Eocene of\r\nEurope and the Laramie of America. The animal fossils are chiefly\r\nfresh-water shells. _Onoclea sensibilis_, several conifers, as _Taxites_\r\n_Olriki_, _Taxodium distichum_, _Glyptostrobus Europæus_, and _Sequoia\r\nLangsdorfii_, and 42 of the dicotyledons are recognised as found also\r\nin American localities. Of these, a large proportion of the more common\r\nspecies occur in the Laramie of the Mackenzie River and elsewhere in\r\nnorthwest Canada, and in the western United States. It is quite likely\r\nalso that several species regarded as distinct may prove to be identical.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that throughout the whole thickness of these Tertiary beds\r\nthe flora is similar, so that it is probable it belongs altogether to the\r\nEocene rather than to the Miocene.\r\n\r\nNo indication has been observed of any period of cold intervening between\r\nthe Lower Cretaceous and the top of the Tertiary deposits, so that, in\r\nall the vast period which these formations represent, the climate of\r\nGreenland would seem to have been temperate. There is, however, as is\r\nthe case farther south, evidence of a gradual diminution of temperature.\r\nIn the Lower Cretaceous the probable mean annual temperature in latitude\r\n71° north is stated as 21° to 22° centigrade, while in the early Tertiary\r\nit is estimated at 12° centigrade. Such temperatures, ranging from 71°\r\nto 53° of Fahrenheit, represent a marvellously warm climate for so high\r\na latitude. In point of fact, however, the evidence of warm climates in\r\nthe arctic regions, in the Palæozoic as well as in the Mesozoic and early\r\nTertiary, should perhaps lead us to conclude that, relatively to the\r\nwhole of geological time, the present arctic climate is unusually severe,\r\nand that a temperate climate in the arctic regions has throughout\r\ngeological time been the rule rather than the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--MINERALISATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state of preservation of fossil plants has been referred to\r\nincidentally in several places in the text; but the following more\r\ndefinite statements may be of service to the reader.\r\n\r\nI. Organic remains imbedded in aqueous deposits may occur in an unchanged\r\ncondition, or only more or less altered by decay. This is often the case\r\nwith such enduring substances as bark and wood, and even with leaves,\r\nwhich appear as thin carbonaceous films when the layers containing\r\nthem are split open. In the more recent deposits such remains occur\r\nlittle modified, or perhaps only slightly changed by partial decay of\r\ntheir more perishable parts. In the older formations, however, they\r\nare usually found in a more or less altered condition, in which their\r\noriginal substance has been wholly or in part changed into coaly, or\r\nbituminous, or anthracitic or graphitic matter, so that leaves are\r\nsometimes represented by stains of graphite, as if drawn on stone with a\r\nlead-pencil. Yet even in this case some portion of the original substance\r\nremains, and without any introduction of foreign material.\r\n\r\nII. On the other hand, such remains are often mineralised by the filling\r\nof their pores or the replacement of their tissues with mineral matter,\r\nso that they become hard and stony, and sometimes retain little or\r\nnothing of their original substance. The more important of these changes,\r\nin so far as they affect fossil plants, may be arranged under the\r\nfollowing heads:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Infiltration_ of mineral matter which has penetrated the pores\r\nof the fossil in a state of solution. Thus the pores of fossil wood are\r\noften filled with calcite, quartz, oxide of iron, or sulphide of iron,\r\nwhile the woody walls of the cells and vessels remain in a carbonised\r\nstate, or converted into coaly matter. When wood is preserved in this\r\nway it has a hard and stony aspect; but we can sometimes dissolve away\r\nthe mineral matter, and restore the vegetable tissue to a condition\r\nresembling that before mineralisation. This is especially the case when\r\ncalcite is the mineralising substance. We sometimes find, on microscopic\r\nexamination, that even cavities so small as those of vegetable cells and\r\nvessels have been filled with successive coats of different kinds of\r\nmineral matter.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Organic matters may be entirely _replaced_ by mineral\r\nsubstances. In this case the cavities and pores have been first\r\nfilled, and then--the walls or solid parts being removed by decay or\r\nsolution--mineral matter, either similar to that filling the cavities,\r\nor differing in colour or composition, has been introduced. Silicified\r\nwood often occurs in this condition. In the case of silicified wood, it\r\nsometimes happens that the cavities of the fibers have been filled with\r\nsilica, and the wood has been afterward removed by decay, leaving the\r\ncasts of the tubular fibers as a loose filamentous substance. Some of\r\nthe Tertiary coniferous woods of California are in this state, and look\r\nlike asbestus, though they show the minute markings of the tissue under\r\nthe microscope. In the case of silicified or agatized woods, it would\r\nseem that the production of carbon dioxide from the decaying wood has\r\ncaused the deposition of silica in its place, from alkaline solutions\r\nof that substance, and thus the carbon has been replaced, atom by atom,\r\nby silicon, until the whole mass has been silicified, yet retaining\r\nperfectly its structure.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The cavities left by fossils which have decayed may be filled with\r\nclay, sand, or other foreign matter, and this, becoming subsequently\r\nhardened into stone, may constitute a _cast_ of the fossils. Trunks of\r\ntrees, roots, &c., are often preserved in this way, appearing as stony\r\ncasts, often with the outer bark of the plant forming a carbonaceous\r\ncoating on their surfaces. In connection with this state may be\r\nmentioned that in which, the wood having decayed, an entire trunk has\r\nbeen flattened so as to appear merely as a compressed film of bark, yet\r\nretaining its markings; and that in which the whole of the vegetable\r\nmatter having been removed, a mere impression of the form remains.\r\n\r\nFossils preserved in either of the modes, (_a_) or (_b_), usually show\r\nmore or less of their minute structures under the microscope. These may\r\nbe observed:--(1) By breaking off small splinters or flakes and examining\r\nthem, either as opaque or as transparent objects. (2) By treating the\r\nmaterial with acids, so as to dissolve out the mineral matters, or\r\nportions of them. This method is especially applicable to fossil woods\r\nmineralised with calcite or pyrite. (3) By grinding thin sections. These\r\nare first polished on one face on a coarse stone or emery hone, and then\r\non a fine hone, then attached by the polished face to glass slips with\r\na transparent cement or Canada balsam, and ground on the opposite face\r\nuntil they become so thin as to be translucent. In most cities there are\r\nlapidaries who prepare slices of this kind; but the amateur can readily\r\nacquire the art by a little practice, and the necessary appliances can\r\nbe obtained through dealers in minerals or in microscopic materials.\r\nVery convenient cutting and polishing machines, some of them quite small\r\nand portable, are now made for the use of amateurs. In the case of\r\nexogenous woods, three sections are necessary to exhibit the whole of the\r\nstructures. One of these should be transverse and two longitudinal, the\r\nlatter in radial and tangential planes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--GENERAL WORKS ON PALÆOBOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the text frequent reference has been made to special memoirs and\r\nreports on the fossil plants of particular regions or formations. There\r\nare, however, some general books, useful to students, which may be\r\nmentioned here. Perhaps the most important is Schimper's \"Traité de\r\nPaléontologie Végétale.\" Very useful information is also contained in\r\nRenault's \"Cours de Botanique Fossile,\" and in Balfour's \"Introduction to\r\nPalæontological Botany,\" and Nicholson's \"Palæontology.\" Unger's \"Genera\r\net Species,\" Brongniart's \"Histoire des Végétaux Fossiles,\" and Lindley\r\nand Button's \"Fossil Flora,\" are older though very valuable works.\r\nWilliamson's \"Memoirs,\" in the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" have greatly\r\nadvanced our knowledge of the structures of Palæozoic plants. Lastly,\r\nthe \"Palæophytology\" of Schenk, now in course of publication in German\r\nand French, in connection with Zittel's \"Palæontology,\" is an important\r\naddition to manuals of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acer, 228.\r\n  Acrogens, 6.\r\n  Agassiz, Prof., 16.\r\n  Alaska, Flora of, 245.\r\n  Algæ, real and spurious, 26, 230.\r\n  Amboy clays, Flora of, 203.\r\n  America, Cretaceous of, 190.\r\n  Angiosperms, 6.\r\n  Annularia, 122.\r\n  Anogens, 6.\r\n  Antholithes, 132.\r\n  Aporoxylon, 25.\r\n  Araucarioxylon, 148.\r\n  Araucarites, 134.\r\n  Archæocalamites, 170.\r\n  Archæopteris, 77, 85.\r\n  Arctic origin of plants, 221, 238.\r\n  Arthrophycus, 30.\r\n  Arthrostigma, 67.\r\n  Asterophyllites, 78, 122, 170.\r\n  Asteropteris, 77, 85.\r\n  Astropolithon, 30.\r\n  Atané, Plants of, 242, 281.\r\n  Atanekerdluk, Plants of, 283.\r\n  Australia, Palæozoic flora of, 147.\r\n    Tertiary flora of, 217.\r\n\r\n  Bauhinia, 204.\r\n  Bear Island, 241.\r\n  Betula, 198.\r\n  Bilobites, 28.\r\n  Bovey Tracey, Plants of, 226.\r\n  Brasenia, 207.\r\n  Buckland, Dr., 179.\r\n  Buthotrephis, 37.\r\n\r\n  Calamites, 77, 123, 166.\r\n  Calamodendron, 125.\r\n  Cambrian flora, 20.\r\n  Canada, Erian of, 103.\r\n    Carboniferous of, 110.\r\n    Laramie of, 209.\r\n    Pleistocene of, 227.\r\n  Carbon in Laurentian, 9.\r\n  Carboniferous flora, 110.\r\n  Carboniferous, Climate of, 138.\r\n    of Southern Hemisphere, 147.\r\n  Cardiocarpum, 82, 153.\r\n  Carruthers, Mr., 24, 98, 180.\r\n    On modifications of modern plants, 225, 269.\r\n  Carya, 196.\r\n  Cauda-galli fucoid, 105.\r\n  Caulerpites, 29.\r\n  Caulopteris, 75, 94.\r\n  Clarke, Prof., 51.\r\n  Climate, Causes of, 247.\r\n  Climate and plants, 216, 220, 232.\r\n    of Carboniferous, 138.\r\n    of Cretaceous and Eocene, 216.\r\n    of Devonian, 47.\r\n    of Early Mesozoic, 178.\r\n  Climate and plants of Laurentian, 17.\r\n    of Pleistocene, 227, 230.\r\n    of Pliocene, 223.\r\n  Coal, origin of, 117, 139.\r\n  Comparison of floras, 272.\r\n  Composite, 266.\r\n  Cone-in-cone, 36.\r\n  Coniferæ, Erian, 78, 96.\r\n  Carboniferous, 134, 148.\r\n    Mesozoic, etc., 181.\r\n  Cope, Mr., 215.\r\n  Cordaites, 78, 130, 151.\r\n  Corylus, 213.\r\n  Crepin, M., 99.\r\n  Cretaceous, Flora of, 190.\r\n    Climate of, 216.\r\n  Croll on climate, 252.\r\n  Cromer, Plants of, 224.\r\n  Cycads, Mesozoic, 178.\r\n  Cyclostigma, 157.\r\n\r\n  Dadoxylon, 96, 134, 148.\r\n  Dawson, Dr. G.

There may be, and are,\r\n  differences in the degree to which the doctrine may be held capable\r\n  of extension into the domain of mind and morals; but there is no\r\n  denying, in scientific circles at least, that as regards the physical\r\n  history of organic nature much has been done toward making good a\r\n  continuous scheme of being.\"--_London Saturday Review_.\r\n\r\n   =FREEDOM IN SCIENCE AND TEACHING.= From the German of Ernst Haeckel.\r\n       With a Prefatory Note by T.

The\r\n  work has been twice revised for the press in the interval, and now\r\n  appears in its fourth edition _enlarged to the extent of nearly two\r\n  hundred pages_, including a full index.\"\r\n\r\n  \"This interesting work--for it is intensely so in its aim, scope, and\r\n  the ability of its author--treats of what the scientists denominate\r\n  _anthropology_, or the natural history of the human species; the\r\n  complete science of man, body and soul, including sex, temperament,\r\n  race, civilization, etc.\"--_Providence Press_.\r\n\r\n   =PREHISTORIC TIMES,= AS ILLUSTRATED BY ANCIENT REMAINS AND THE\r\n       MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF MODERN SAVAGES. Illustrated. Entirely new\r\n       revised edition. 8vo. Cloth, $5.00.\r\n\r\n  The book ranks among the noblest works of the interesting and\r\n  important class to which it belongs. As a _résumé_ of our present\r\n  knowledge of prehistoric man, it leaves nothing to be desired. It is\r\n  not only a good book of reference but the best on the subject.\r\n\r\n  \"This is, perhaps, the best summary of evidence now in our possession\r\n  concerning the general character of prehistoric times. The Bronze\r\n  Age, The Stone Age, The Tumuli, The Lake Inhabitants of Switzerland,\r\n  The Shell Mounds, The Cave Man, and The Antiquity of Man, are the\r\n  titles of the most important chapters.\"--_Dr. C.

Cloth, $2.00.\r\n\r\n  \"This volume contains the record of various experiments made with\r\n  ants, bees, and wasps during the last ten years, with a view to test\r\n  their menial condition and powers of sense. The principal point in\r\n  which Sir John's mode of experiment differs from those of Huber,\r\n  Forel, McCook, and others, is that he has carefully watched and\r\n  marked particular insects, and has had their nests under observation\r\n  for long periods--one of his ants' nests having been under constant\r\n  inspection ever since 1874 His observations are made principally\r\n  upon ants, because they show more power and flexibility of mind; and\r\n  the value of his studies is that they belong to the department of\r\n  original research.\"\"\r\n\r\n  \"We have no hesitation in saying that the author has presented us\r\n  with the most valuable series of observations on a special subject\r\n  that has ever been produced, charmingly written, full of logical\r\n  deductions, and, when we consider his multitudinous engagements,\r\n  a remarkable illustration of economy of time. As a contribution\r\n  to insect psychology, it will be long before this book finds a\r\n  parallel.\"--_London Athenæum._\r\n\r\n                         -----------------------\r\n\r\n           New York: D.
