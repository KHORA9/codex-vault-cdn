Cellar wintering is practicable where the\r\naverage outdoor temperature during the winter months is as low as 25°\r\nF. A map is given (p. 3) so that the beekeeper may know whether this\r\nmethod is advisable in his locality.\r\n\r\nThe cellar should be arranged so that the ceiling is below the frost\r\nline, and so that the ceiling and side walls are thoroughly protected\r\nat all points. The cellar should be kept so that the lowest temperature\r\nwithin the hives is at least 52° F. At this temperature there will be\r\nlittle need of special ventilating arrangements. There should be no\r\ncondensation of moisture within the hives, and the cellar should be\r\nwell drained.\r\n\r\nBees should be put into the cellar after a good flight in late\r\nNovember, or earlier in the more northern localities. They should be\r\nremoved when fresh pollen and nectar are available, usually about the\r\nlast of March.\r\n\r\nSoon after the hives are placed on their summer stands, each colony\r\nshould be given additional stores and room for the development of a\r\nlarge quantity of brood.\r\n\r\nIt is important that none of the factors of good wintering be omitted.\r\nSeveral tests are given in this bulletin so that the beekeeper may\r\ndetermine whether his cellar is a satisfactory place for wintering\r\nbees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTERING BEES IN CELLARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         Page.\r\n\r\n  Cellar wintering versus outdoor wintering                 3\r\n\r\n  Where is cellar wintering advisable                       4\r\n\r\n  Essentials to success                                     5\r\n\r\n  Necessity of strong colonies in the fall                  5\r\n\r\n  Winter stores                                             6\r\n\r\n  Arrangement of the apiary                                 7\r\n\r\n  The bee cellar                                            7\r\n\r\n  Putting the bees into the cellar                         12\r\n\r\n  Maintenance of the cellar during the winter              13\r\n\r\n  Removal of the bees from the cellar                      17\r\n\r\n  Providing breeding room and stores in the spring         19\r\n\r\n  Measures of success in cellar wintering                  20\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELLAR WINTERING VERSUS OUTDOOR WINTERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBees in the more northern parts of the United States for many years\r\nhave been placed by some of the best beekeepers in cellars or special\r\nrepositories during the coldest parts of the winter. There has been a\r\ngrowing feeling, however, that if outdoor wintering is practicable, in\r\nmost cases it gives better results, and there has been a decided change\r\nfrom cellar wintering to outdoor wintering within the past decade. The\r\ndifficulty seems to be that the methods of cellar wintering practiced\r\nhave not been satisfactory and it seems probable that if as much\r\nattention had been given, to the perfection of the methods of cellar\r\nwintering as has been given to an improvement of the methods of outdoor\r\nwintering, there would not have been as great a change to the outdoor\r\nmethods as has taken place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Map of the United States showing regions where\r\ncellar wintering is practicable, based on the average temperature of\r\nJanuary. From data furnished by the United States Weather Bureau.]\r\n\r\nThe placing of bees in a cellar is only another way of putting\r\ninsulation about the hives, the only difference being that in the\r\ncellar all of the hives are protected alike and the protection is\r\nplaced about the apiary instead of around hives in groups or singly.\r\nIt follows that the principles which apply to successful outdoor\r\nwintering apply equally to the protection of the bees in the cellar.\r\nIt is urged, therefore, that before attempting to winter bees in the\r\ncellar, the beekeeper study the bulletins[1] of the department in which\r\nthese principles are set forth.\r\n\r\n[1] Department Bulletin 93, The Temperature of the Honeybee Cluster In\r\nWinter. Farmers' Bulletin 695, Outdoor Wintering of Bees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE IS CELLAR WINTERING ADVISABLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore deciding whether or not the bees are to be wintered in a cellar,\r\nseveral factors should be considered, the chief of these being (1) the\r\nwinter climate, (2) the kind of winter stores, and (3) the location of\r\nthe apiary as regards wind protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nIn any locality where the average temperature of the winter months\r\nfalls below 25° F. (zone 1) cellar wintering may be practiced with\r\nprofit, and in localities where the average temperature of these\r\nmonths falls as low as 15° F. (zone 2) cellar wintering is much to\r\nbe preferred. Figure 1 shows the boundaries of these zones for the\r\nUnited States for the month of January, which may be taken as typical\r\nof the winter months. It will be noted that these zones do not follow\r\nparallels of latitude. As was pointed out in the bulletin of the\r\ndepartment on outdoor wintering,[2] it is quite possible to protect\r\nbees in zone 1 sufficiently to winter them outdoors, but if a proper\r\ncellar is provided, if conditions within the cellar are correct, and if\r\nthe stores are good and the colonies are strong, just as good results\r\nmay be obtained from cellar wintering.\r\n\r\n[2] Farmers' Bulletin 1012, Preparation of Bees for Outdoor Wintering.\r\n\r\nIn zone 1 the average temperature of the outside air during the mouth\r\nof January is 25° F., or lower in the more northern parts of the zone.\r\nThis means that in colonies wintered outdoors the bees are compelled\r\nto overcome this degree of cold at all times during the coldest part\r\nof the winter. If they are so well packed that the heat which they\r\ngenerate is lost slowly, they are able to generate sufficient heat to\r\nmake the interior of the hive warm enough to allow them to break their\r\ncluster as is necessary. In zone 2, however, the bees will be compelled\r\nto generate heat sufficient to overcome the more severe cold of that\r\nzone, and this calls for the expenditure by the bees of so much more\r\nfood and vitality that it is more economical to put them in a good\r\ncellar during the months of the most severe cold, and cellar wintering\r\nis therefore preferable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF WINTER STORES.\r\n\r\nIn localities where the stores for the bees gathered during the latter\r\npart of the summer are not of the first quality, it is safer to winter\r\nthe bees outdoors. This is a large factor in the placing of the zones\r\nshown in figure 1, for it is quite common in the region south of zone 1\r\nfor the full honey to be of inferior quality. It is extremely fortunate\r\nthat in both of the zones shown the stores available in winter are\r\nusually of the finest quality. As will be shown later, it is highly\r\nimportant that the beekeeper pay special attention to the character of\r\nthe stores in the hive at the beginning of the winter, and if they are\r\nnot as good as they should be, this deficiency should be corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION AS REGARDS WIND PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nIn zone 1, if the apiary is so badly located that the winter winds are\r\nsevere, the beekeeper will do well to winter in a cellar, although,\r\nas will be shown later, it is not best to choose such a site for the\r\napiary even during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENTIALS TO SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in the case of outdoor wintering, the essentials to success in\r\ncaring for a normal colony of bees from the end of one season's\r\nhoney-flow to the beginning of the next lie in providing three things\r\nin abundance: (1) Stores of good quality, (2) protection from wind\r\nand cold, and (3) room for the rearing of brood at appropriate times.\r\nThese factors must not be lacking at the right times, and if any one\r\nis omitted it may prevent the bees from gathering the crop of the\r\nfollowing season. These three factors do not apply equally throughout\r\nthe period of relative inactivity, but as certainly as any one of them\r\nis decreased, just so certainly will the crop of the following year be\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nIn practicing cellar wintering it is unnecessary to leave so much honey\r\nwith the bees during the time that they are in the cellar, and it is\r\nnot necessary during that period to leave room for the rearing of\r\nbrood. During the coldest part of the winter the bees need especially\r\nprotection from cold and wind, although enough good stores must be in\r\nthe hive to keep them through that period in good condition. Probably\r\na large part of the failure of beekeepers in practicing cellar\r\nwintering comes from the fact that before and after the bees are in\r\nthe cellar the important factors of stores and breeding room have not\r\nbeen adequately supplied. Before the bees are put into the cellar they\r\nmust have room for breeding and stores in abundance, and after they\r\nare taken out these two factors must be present in greatly increased\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNECESSITY OF STRONG COLONIES IN THE FALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in the case of wintering outdoors, it is wasteful to attempt to\r\nwinter weak colonies. It is difficult to set standards of colony\r\nstrength at this season, but it is unwise to attempt to winter\r\ncolonies that are not strong enough to have brood sufficient to fill\r\nthree or four Langstroth frames two months before the first killing\r\nfrost. If the colonies in the apiary are not of the proper strength,\r\nit is wise to unite until the proper strength is reached. Any uniting\r\nshould be done before the close of brood-rearing.\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance that every colony have a good queen in\r\norder that brood-rearing may continue in the fall and may then again\r\nproceed rapidly in the spring. Usually it is best to requeen at least\r\nevery two years, but if good wintering is practiced the colonies will\r\ncome out of winter quarters so strong and will build up so rapidly\r\nin the spring that the queens will soon wear out, making it safer to\r\nrequeen every year. To get the best results from requeening, all young\r\nqueens should be introduced so that they begin to lay about two months\r\nbefore the first killing frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER STORES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stores given to the bees from the end of one season to the\r\nbeginning of the next are of the first importance. It is necessary to\r\nconsider both the quality and the quantity of these stores.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITY OF STORES.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, it is fortunate that in both of the zones where\r\ncellar wintering is or might be practiced the natural stores usually\r\nare good. Honeys such as those from white and alsike clovers, sweet\r\nclover, alfalfa, wild raspberry, buckwheat, and willowherb are fine\r\nstores for winter, while honeys from basswood, heartsease (smart-weed),\r\nasters, goldenrod, and most of the other fall flowers are less\r\ndesirable. It is especially important during the period when the\r\nbees are in the cellar that the stores shall be of the very finest\r\nquality, and it is therefore the practice of many good beekeepers to\r\nfeed each colony 5 pounds or more of sirup made of granulated sugar\r\nInto in the fall, after all brood-rearing has ceased. This insures that\r\nthe bees will have for their use, during the period of confinement in\r\nthe cellar, stores which will not bring about the condition known as\r\ndysentery. In general it may be stated that honeys from mixed sources\r\nand dark honeys, except buckwheat, are to be avoided. Honeydew honeys\r\nare highly injurious and in all cases where such stores are present\r\ngranulated sugar sirup should be fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF STORES.\r\n\r\nFrom the end of one honey season to the beginning of the next a good\r\ncolony of bees will need fully 45 pounds of honey. When the bees are\r\nwintered in the cellar, it is usual not to have all of this honey in\r\nthe one hive body in which they are wintered. It is a good practice\r\nto have at least 20 pounds within this hive, although 15 pounds will\r\nbe safe. It is absolutely imperative, however, that the remainder of\r\nthe 45 pounds shall be available to be given to the bees soon after,\r\nthey are taken from the cellar. The most common cause of poor colonies\r\nin the spring is poverty, directly due to neglect on the part of the\r\nbeekeeper. A good beekeeper sees to it that at no time when brood is\r\nbeing reared do his bees have less than 15 pounds of stores in the\r\nhive, and the full amount of 45 pounds often will all be used, and is\r\nalways needed if the colonies are to come to full strength on time\r\nfor the gathering of the full crop. This amount is always augmented\r\nby honey from spring flowers, for 45 pounds of honey is not enough to\r\nbring a colony to full strength in time for the main honey-flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF THE APIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere bees are wintered in cellars the particular arrangement of the\r\nhives in the apiary is not so important a problem as where they are\r\nwintered on their summer stands, yet there are certain important\r\nconsiderations in the arrangement of the entire apiary which should be\r\nkept in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIND PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nIt is important that a place be chosen where the bees will be protected\r\nfrom cold winds in the spring after they are taken from the cellar\r\nand again in the fall before they are taken to the cellar. A grove of\r\ntrees or an adjacent hill usually offers the best protection, or it\r\nis possible to make an artificial windbreak such as a high fence. A\r\nnatural windbreak usually is better, for it is more extensive in most\r\ncases. Too much reliance should not be placed in buildings, for often\r\nthey merely divert the wind slightly and may make conditions worse. A\r\nfence made of close boards usually is unsatisfactory, for it causes\r\nwhirls.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCE OF THE APIARY FROM THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\nTo carry colonies of bees a long distance from the apiary to the cellar\r\nis not an easy task, even though the hives be light at that time of the\r\nyear. It is best, therefore, that the apiary be located not more than\r\n50 yards from the cellar, and even this distance is objectionable. If a\r\nspecial cellar is built for the bees, the apiary should be so located\r\nthat the cellar may be built immediately adjacent. If the bees are to\r\nbe wintered in the cellar under the beekeeper's residence, the apiary\r\nshould be located as near as possible to the cellar door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEE CELLAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that the beekeeper may have reason to expect success in cellar\r\nwintering, it is imperative that he give careful consideration to\r\nthe construction of the bee cellar. There has been a tendency among\r\nbeekeepers greatly to overestimate the value of their own cellars, and\r\nespecially to assume that the conditions which they are able to get in\r\ntheir cellars are exactly correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELLAR UNDER THE RESIDENCE.\r\n\r\nSome of the best bee cellars are those under the residences of\r\nbeekeepers, and in general such a cellar is better than one built\r\nespecially for cellar wintering. This is because the temperature of\r\nsuch a cellar usually is quite a little higher than that in a specially\r\nconstructed repository. The best results in cellar wintering have been\r\nobtained in cellars under residences which are heated by furnaces, thus\r\nhaving a higher cellar temperature. In such a cellar provision must\r\nbe made for partitioning off a space where the bees will be located\r\nso that there is no light or other disturbing factor during the time\r\nof their confinement. Since a cellar temperature about 50° F. is\r\ndesirable, it is well to choose a part of the cellar through which some\r\nof the furnace pipes run, and if this results in too high a temperature\r\nthese pipes may be insulated somewhat. It is best to choose a part of\r\nthe cellar where there are no windows and where the outside walls are\r\nthoroughly protected to the top, either by a bank of soil or in some\r\nother fashion. This will result in a more equable temperature than\r\nis possible in a cellar exposed to sudden changes of temperature on\r\nthe outside walls, for even a stone wall 18 inches thick will allow a\r\nconsiderable amount of heat to escape. In a cellar under a residence\r\nthere will be abundant ventilation without any special provision\r\nbeing made for this. A test of the value of such a cellar is the even\r\ntemperature which may be obtained, as will be discussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL WINTER REPOSITORY.\r\n\r\nIf properly constructed and protected, a special cellar or cave for the\r\nbees gives the best possible results in wintering, yet few such cellars\r\nhave been built, for the reason that most beekeepers have omitted some\r\nvitally important factors. The usual fault is in having too great a\r\nvariation in temperature and in giving excessive ventilation, which in\r\nturn causes fluctuations in temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOIL AND CONTOUR OF THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND.\r\n\r\nTo provide good drainage and adequate ventilation for the bee cellar\r\nwithout making any special ventilators, it is desirable to build it in\r\na sandy hillside. If it is possible to choose a place for the cellar\r\nwhere the snow drifts deeply, this will afford a valuable addition\r\nto the insulation of the cellar. If the cellar is on level ground,\r\ndrifting of snow may be increased by the proper building of open\r\nfences, such as are used to prevent drifting over railway tracks.\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible to utilize a sandy hillside, it will be necessary\r\nto build walls and a floor for the cellar and to make adequate\r\nprovision for the drainage of the cellar. The hillside cellar has, the\r\ngreat advantage of having easy drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPACITY OF THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\nIf the bees are kept in apiaries of perhaps 100 colonies and if a\r\ncellar is built for each apiary, then it is possible to build a cellar\r\nof just the right capacity. If a central cellar is built for all the\r\napiaries and the bees in outapiaries are brought into the home apiary\r\nfor winter, the beekeeper will wish to build the cellar sufficiently\r\nlarge for future expansion of his business, and beekeepers are finding\r\nout, that they can keep many more colonies of bees than they formerly\r\nthought possible. Perhaps the better plan is to have a cellar in each\r\napiary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Interior of bee cellar with hives In piles of\r\nfour. Insulation above the ceiling is not shown.]\r\n\r\nThe usual practice is to allow 1-1/2 to 2 square feet of floor surface\r\nfor each colony, on the assumption that the colonies will be placed in\r\npiles of four (fig. 2). It is not desirable to pile hives higher than\r\nthis, if the cellar roof is 6-1/2 feet high in the clear, and it is\r\ndifficult to lift heavy hives any higher than the number specified. For\r\nan apiary of 100 colonies, it will be found desirable to have a cellar\r\n10 feet wide and from 15 to 20 feet long, clear of the inner walls. If\r\none is just getting a start in beekeeping he should build his cellar on\r\nthe assumption that later he will increase the number of his colonies,\r\nand should allow for this, for it is better to have the cellar too\r\nlarge than too small.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLS AND FLOOR.\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed by many beekeepers that concrete walls and floor\r\nare not desirable, yet if the cellar is properly insulated there is no\r\nbetter material. If the cellar is built in a hillside of sandy soil,\r\nwooden sides will be satisfactory and no floor other than the soil need\r\nbe provided. In such soil the drainage is good and the only function\r\nof the side walls is to hold the sides up to prevent caving in. In a\r\nmoist soil a concrete floor and walls should be built, and the concrete\r\nshould be waterproof. Under no circumstances should any of the side\r\nwalls below the ceiling be exposed above ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Diagram of bee cellar. Clearance 6-1/2 feet,\r\nceiling 2-1/2 feet below ground level, packed with about 11 feet of\r\nsawdust.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROOF.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of the cellar should be below ground level sufficiently to\r\nbring it below the level of frost. For the regions where bees should be\r\nwintered in cellars this usually will be at least 2-1/2 feet below the\r\nlevel of the ground (fig. 3). The ceiling should be 6-1/2 feet above\r\nthe floor, just sufficiently high to permit a tall man to work with\r\ncomfort. If the ceiling is higher it will result usually in too low a\r\ntemperature at the floor. The ceiling then should be covered completely\r\non top with some insulating material, such as sawdust, and if sawdust\r\nis used it should be piled on about 1-1/2 feet thick. Unless about this\r\namount of protection is given on the ceiling it will be impossible to\r\nget the right cellar temperature during the coldest part of the winter.\r\nIf the cellar is built in a sandy soil, it is possible to use the soil\r\nas a cover for the ceiling, in which event about 3 feet of soil should\r\nbe placed over the inner roof of the cellar. The entire insulating\r\nmaterial, of whatever kind used, should then be protected from rain\r\nand snow by having a roof over it. This roof should project at least\r\n2 feet, preferably more, beyond the outside of the cellar wall, and\r\nprovision should be made for currying off the water from the roof.\r\n\r\nIn case the beekeeper desires to build an apiary house over the bee,\r\ncellar, as is done frequently, he must provide a floor for this house\r\nat least at ground level, and he can not successfully use the ceiling\r\nof the cellar as the floor of the upper house. There is no objection to\r\nbuilding a house above the cellar if adequate protection is given the\r\ncellar, but it must not be assumed that the house offers any material\r\ninsulation to the cellar, for in most cases these houses are not heated\r\nin the winter. The relation of the house floor to the ceiling of the\r\ncellar is shown in figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTRANCE TO THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\nFrequently the entrance is a weak spot in the insulation of the cellar,\r\nand it is useless to protect the roof and sides unless care is used in\r\nthe building of the entrance. If the entrance is at the end or one side\r\nof the cellar, it will be necessary to build a sort of vestibule with\r\ndouble doors so that the heat of the cellar will not be lost rapidly.\r\nThe heavier and thicker these doors, the better for the bees.\r\n\r\nThe best type of vestibule is a long, narrow passage lending into the\r\nhillside, and it should be closed by doors at both the inside and\r\noutside ends. If possible the vestibule should be built and protected\r\nso that the temperature within the vestibule will never fall below\r\nfreezing. In the building of the vestibule, also, the beekeeper should\r\nconsider the ease with which the bees may be carried in and out of the\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned previously, the cellar must be well drained,\r\neither by natural or by artificial means. No stagnant water should be\r\nallowed to remain in the cellar, although at the higher temperatures\r\nof the best cellars this does less harm than it does in cellars that\r\nare too cold. Some beekeepers have advocated having a stream of water\r\nflowing through the cellar, and this will do no harm in warm cellars,\r\nand it may serve to assist somewhat in maintaining an even temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENTILATION.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious faults of bee cellars is in providing for too\r\nmuch ventilation, resulting in great fluctuations in temperature. In a\r\ncellar which maintains a temperature of 50° F. or more there is little\r\nneed for ventilation, for the Was then need little oxygen and only a\r\nsmall amount of carbon dioxide is given off. Other things being equal,\r\nthe colder the cellar, the greater the need of ventilation. If poor\r\nstores are in the hives, the bees will need more ventilation than will\r\nbe desirable when good stores are used. In a warm cellar in a sandy\r\nhillside no ventilating shaft need be built.\r\n\r\nIn any event, one shaft 6 inches square running through the ceiling of\r\nthe cellar to the outside will be sufficient for any cellar that is fit\r\nfor the wintering of bees. During the coldest part of the winter the\r\ninterchange of air between the inside of the cellar and the outside\r\nwill be materially increased by the great difference in temperature and\r\nthis one ventilator may be entirely or nearly closed. During the milder\r\nweather of the fall and spring this amount of ventilation will do no\r\nharm. The top of the ventilating shaft, which should extend at least\r\n6 feet above the outer roof, may be painted black in order to induce\r\ngreater movement of air when the sun shines. The shaft should be so\r\narranged that it does not admit light to the cellar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING THE BEES INTO THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the bees are carried into the cellar it should be well aired\r\nand cleaned, and it will be well to keep it open for several days\r\nbeforehand. No debris or refuse should be left in the cellar when the\r\nbees are taken in.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME.\r\n\r\nFor zone 1 (fig. 1) it is usually desirable to wait until about the\r\nmiddle of November before putting the bees into winter quarters. If one\r\ncould know exactly when the bees would have the last opportunity for a\r\ncleansing flight, they would be put into the cellar just after that,\r\nbut we can not always be sure that there will be suitable weather for\r\nsuch flight in late November, and there is, therefore, considerable\r\ndoubt every year as to just the right time to put the bees away.\r\nFrequently it happens that the weather is suitable for a flight about\r\nNovember 20, and it is best to wait until then before attempting to put\r\nthe bees in the cellar. The flight of only a few bees from the hive\r\nshould not be construed as a cleansing flight. In this connection it is\r\nhighly desirable that the beekeeper keep a careful watch of the weather\r\nmaps daily, so that he may know at all times about what weather may be\r\nexpected for a few days in advance. For the beekeeper's purpose the\r\ndaily forecasts published in newspapers are scarcely enough; and if no\r\ndaily weather maps are convenient near by, it will repay the beekeeper\r\nwell to subscribe for them. They are valuable not only at the time of\r\nputting the bees into the cellar but at many other times of the year.\r\n\r\nSoon after a period when the barometric pressure has been low, bringing\r\nhigh temperatures suitable for flights (at least 60° F.), there usually\r\nwill be a period when the barometric pressure is high, bringing lower,\r\ntemperatures. At the shifting from low to high barometric pressure\r\nthere is frequently a time when it is cloudy. This is a fine time to\r\nput the bees into the cellar. These periods of high and low barometric\r\npressure follow each other with rather marked regularity in the\r\nfall, and it is rather safe to assume that just at the end of the\r\nwell-defined low pressure which next follows after November 15 is the\r\nbest time to put the bees into the cellar. It is better to put the\r\nbees in the cellar a week or so before the last opportunity for flight\r\nthan to put them in after exposure to cold which is not followed by a\r\ncleansing flight.\r\n\r\nFor zone 2 it will be desirable to put the bees away a little earlier,\r\nalthough the oncoming of winter is not so much earlier in the North as\r\none might imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CARRY THE BEES.\r\n\r\nWhen one person carries the bees into the cellar the best method is to\r\nstand at the back of the hive and grasp the bottom of the hive with\r\nboth hands. The hive is then lifted and the cover brought up against\r\nthe chest firmly, permitting the operator to walk without interference\r\nand with a minimum of stooping. If there are cleats on the ends of the\r\nhive bodies, those may be rested on the forearms, although with this\r\nmethod there is some danger that the bottoms will drop off unless they\r\nare stapled.\r\n\r\nIf the temperature is sufficiently low (slightly above freezing),\r\nthere will be no need of closing the entrances when the bees are being\r\ncarried in. Every care should be taken not to jar the hives more than\r\nis absolutely necessary from the time that they are lifted until they\r\nare in their final place in the cellar.\r\n\r\nIf more than one person is engaged in carrying in the hives, the hives\r\nmay be placed carefully on carriers with handles, and two or more of\r\nthem may be carried at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO STACK THE HIVES.\r\n\r\nThe bottom hive in a pile should rest on an empty hive body or some\r\nother such support of about that size (figs. 2 and 3). The hives then\r\nshould be placed one on top of the other until they are four high.\r\nIt is best by far to put each pile of four hives about 6 inches from\r\nadjacent piles, so that in handling the hives on one pile there is no\r\ndisturbance of bees in other piles. Allowance is made for this space\r\nbetween the piles of hives in the estimate of the floor space needed\r\nfor each colony (p. 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF THE CELLAR DURING THE WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the cellar is properly constructed it will need little if any\r\ncare during the time that the bees are inside. It is only the poor\r\nbee cellar which requires constant attention to prevent changes in\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to the best temperature of the cellar\r\nduring the winter. Commonly it is stated that a temperature of 40° to\r\n45° F. is best, but this is colder than usually is best for the finest\r\nresults. A temperature below 40° F. is invariably bad for the bees, and\r\na cellar in which the temperature goes as low as freezing is not a fit\r\nplace for bees.\r\n\r\nIt has been found by the authors that bees do the least amount of work\r\nwhen the temperature of the air immediately surrounding them (inside\r\nthe hive) stands at 57° F. This is, therefore, the temperature which\r\nthe beekeeper should bear in mind, rather than to lay too much stress\r\non the temperature of the cellar itself. The place for a thermometer\r\nin the bee cellar is inside the entrance of a good colony where it may\r\nbe read easily by simply pulling it out. A chemical thermometer is\r\nbest for this purpose, and it should register 52° F. or more inside\r\nthe hive entrance. In order to have the right temperature within the\r\nhive it usually will be best to have the temperature of the cellar at\r\nabout 50° F. or slightly higher. As will be shown later, however, it is\r\nquite possible to have the right temperature within the hive when the\r\ntemperature of the cellar is a few degrees lower than that stated.\r\n\r\nIf the beekeeper will pay attention to the temperature of the interior\r\nof the hive he will find that in colder cellars it is desirable to give\r\nthe hives some insulation to conserve the heat generated by the bees\r\nin much the same way that this heat is conserved when bees are packed\r\noutdoors, although the amount of protection will be much less. In a\r\ncellar where the temperature falls to 45° F. it will be found best\r\nto have the covers of the hives sealed on tightly and the entrances\r\nreduced to 3/8 inch by 2 inches. In a cellar with a temperature of 50°\r\nF. or more the entrances may be left open the full width of the hive.\r\nIf there is a tendency for the temperature to fall to 45° F. or less,\r\nthe tops of the hives may be protected by cushions of chaff or other\r\nmaterials placed at least on the top of the uppermost hives, for each\r\nof the lower three hives is protected somewhat by the one above it.\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible to maintain the temperatures recommended unless\r\nthe cellar is built in the way described, or in some other way by which\r\nthe cellar is equally well insulated. It is impossible to maintain an\r\nequable and high temperature in a cellar the walls and ceiling of which\r\nare exposed to the outside air.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENTILATION OF THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\nIf the proper temperature is maintained in the cellar there will be\r\nlittle need of ventilation, for in almost all cases there will be\r\nsufficient interchange of air to keep the bees in good condition.\r\nIf the temperature is as low as 45° F., a little ventilation will be\r\nneeded, although most of the bee cellars that have been built have\r\nhad too much ventilation, and as a result it has been impossible\r\nto maintain a correct temperature within them. In cold weather the\r\ntendency toward an interchange of air is greatest, and at such times\r\nthe ventilators may be entirely closed. In mild weather it makes no\r\ndifference if large ventilators are open, unless this results in too\r\ngreat a rise in temperature.\r\n\r\nIn a well-insulated cellar it should not be necessary to ventilate at\r\nnight at the approach of spring to cool the air inside, for the bees\r\nwill not get so warm from their own activity as will bees in a cellar\r\nthat is or has been too cold. The greatest problem in most cellars is\r\nto maintain the right temperature during the spring just before the\r\nbees are to be removed. The trouble is that in most cellars--those\r\nwhich are too cold in winter--the bees generate heat constantly\r\nduring the winter and as a result have an accumulation of feces in\r\nthe intestines, resulting in a condition known as dysentery. For this\r\nreason they become excited easily, and beekeepers have thought it\r\nnecessary to ventilate the cellar at night freely in order to remedy\r\nthis trouble. The proper method, of course, is to prevent it by keeping\r\nthe temperature higher during the winter, but if the temperature has\r\nfallen too low during the winter ventilation at night seems to help\r\nsomewhat. It is safe, however, to say that a cellar in which this\r\nhappens is not satisfactory as a place to keep bees during the winter,\r\nand steps should be taken to insulate it more completely before bees\r\nare put into it again. If the bees are wintering on stores that are\r\nnot of the best quality the tendency to accumulate feces will be far\r\ngreater, even with the right temperatures inside the hives, and if\r\nthere is dysentery it may be relieved somewhat by ventilation, although\r\nthis is simply reducing a symptom and is not removing the cause of the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENTILATION OF THE HIVE.\r\n\r\nSince bees in a good cellar require little ventilation, practically no\r\nattention need be paid to this subject if the cellar has been built in\r\nthe way advised. If the temperature of the cellar tends to fall too\r\nlow, it is advisable to reduce the entrances of the hives, for with a\r\ngreater difference between the temperatures within and outside the hive\r\nthe tendency for interchange of air will be correspondingly greater. In\r\nany cellar fit for the wintering of bees it will be neither necessary\r\nnor desirable to ventilate the hives at the top, as sometimes has been\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation of the hive within the cellar is not so much for the\r\nelimination of foul air as for the escape of moisture, and therefore\r\nthe amount of ventilation needed for the hive depends upon the\r\nhumidity of the air within the cellar. If the temperature of the cellar\r\nis kept high enough there will be no condensation of moisture within\r\nthe hive, and if water is ever observed on the covers of the hives\r\nit is conclusive proof that the cellar is too cold for the bees. In\r\na cellar so cold that condensed moisture shows on the bottoms of the\r\nhives stops should be taken at once to raise the temperature.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made in the past to provide for the cellar\r\nfresh air which has been warmed somewhat before entry. The most common\r\nmethod is to have the air pass through tiles under ground for perhaps\r\n100 feet before it enters the cellar. In general, it may be said that\r\nnone of these devices has been worth the trouble and expense involved\r\nand none of them has served the purpose for which it was intended. It\r\nhas been proposed also to ventilate the bee cellar by wind pressure.\r\nThe devices which have been made for such ventilation will function\r\nonly when there is considerable wind and then only when the wind is in\r\nthe right quarter; therefore they are not at all to be recommended. By\r\nfar the best plan is simply to build the bee cellar correctly, for,\r\nthen little ventilation will be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEANING THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\nIn even the best of cellars there will be some dead bees on the\r\nfloor, and those may be cleaned up once or twice during the winter.\r\nIn a cellar with proper temperature there will be few dead bees until\r\nafter the middle of the winter, but the death rate increases toward the\r\nclose of the winter. If the cellar is cleaned, it should be done with\r\nas little disturbance as possible. No bright light should be admitted\r\nat this time, although a moderate amount seems to do little harm until\r\nafter the bees have an accumulation of feces in the intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVING THE BEES FOR FLIGHT DURING THE WINTER.\r\n\r\nSome beekeepers have advocated removing the colonies toward the end\r\nof the winter for a flight on some warm day and then replacing them,\r\non the supposition that the flight would enable the bees to stand a\r\nlonger period of confinement. It is found, however, that if bees are\r\ndisturbed, as by carrying them out, they begin brood-rearing almost\r\ninvariably, and this does more harm than the flight does good.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTURBANCE DURING THE WINTER.\r\n\r\nWork in or about the bee cellar while the bees are confined should\r\nbe done with the least possible disturbance of the bees, for often a\r\nlittle handling or jarring of the hive causes sufficient excitement\r\nto increase the temperature of the cluster to the point where\r\nbrood-rearing begins. This is true especially in late winter. It is\r\nby far the wisest plan, therefore, to stay out of the cellar during\r\nthe winter, except on the few occasions when a little work, such as\r\ncleaning out, makes a visit seem needed. Care should be taken not to\r\njar the hives or to allow light to strike the entrance. Of course, if\r\nbees are being wintered in a cellar which has the right temperature, a\r\nlittle disturbance does little or no harm, but there is no reason why\r\nbees should be disturbed in winter and the beekeeper should not run\r\nany risk of starting brood-rearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF THE BEES FROM THE CELLAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME.\r\n\r\nThe old rule of many beekeepers is to take the bees from the cellar\r\nwhen the soft maples are in bloom. This is an excellent rule in\r\nlocalities where there are trees of this species. In general, in zone 1\r\nthe right time to take the bees out of the cellar is about the time of\r\nthe spring equinox (March 21).\r\n\r\nIn choosing a time for the removal of the bees, the beekeeper again\r\nshould watch the weather maps closely. He should choose a time\r\nwhen a high-pressure area is just passing and at the approach of\r\na well-defined low-pressure area. At such a time the weather will\r\nbe cool, not permitting the bees to fly, but at the time of the\r\nlow-pressure area the weather will become warmer, allowing the good\r\nflights, which are then badly needed.\r\n\r\nIf the bees are taken out at a time when they can fly at once--and some\r\nbeekeepers prefer this--they should be taken out in the early morning,\r\nso that they can have a good flight before night. Bees should not be\r\ntaken from the cellar at a time when they can fly only a little, but\r\nthey should either be taken out when they can not fly at all or at a\r\ntime when they can fly freely almost at once. Bees in good condition\r\nrarely fly freely unless the outside temperature is as high as 60° F.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION OF DRIFTING.\r\n\r\nWhen the bees are taken from the cellar and placed on their summer\r\npositions they sometimes tend to leave the weaker, colonies and on\r\ntheir return to collect in those with greater populations. This is\r\nknown as \"drifting.\" In general, the bees tend to drift toward the\r\nwindward side of the apiary. Most frequently they join the hives that\r\nwere first set out and which have established a strong flight by the\r\ntime the neighboring colonies have first taken wing. The tendencies,\r\ntherefore, are to join flying colonies, stronger colonies, and the\r\nend colonies in a row. The condition of the bees plays a large part\r\nin drifting, for if the bees are badly in need of a flight because of\r\ndysentery they go at once into the air without properly marking the\r\nlocation of their hive, and therefore are not able to find it when they\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nTo prevent drifting, it is best to set the bees out when it is too cold\r\nfor them to fly, so that as the weather warms, permitting flight, this\r\nwill take place more naturally. It is also well to reduce the entrances\r\nso that as the bees leave the hive their tendency to orient themselves\r\nwill be greater. It is claimed by some beekeepers that if the cellar\r\nis well aired the night before the bees are to be removed, they will\r\nbe in better condition and will drift less, but it is not clear what\r\ndifference this can make unless the clusters are made tighter because\r\nof lower temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeekeepers have discussed the question whether, after removal, the bees\r\nshould be placed on the same stands occupied by them the fall before.\r\nIf the bees could remember their old location so that they would return\r\nto it, even after an interval of four months, it would be necessary,\r\nor at least desirable, to place each colony on the same stand which it\r\noccupied previously. There is no evidence, however, that the memory\r\nof the bees is so good, and it is usually the ease that the bees of a\r\ncolony will lose the memory of location within a week; therefore no\r\nattention need be paid to this feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF THE HIVES IN THE SPRING.\r\n\r\nThe greatest objection to wintering bees in cellars is that after they\r\nare removed they are exposed to low temperatures. The ideal practice\r\nwould be to pack the bees after taking them out in much the same way\r\nthat bees are packed for outdoor wintering, but the work involved makes\r\nthis impracticable. There can be no doubt that protection at this\r\ntime would be beneficial. As has been pointed out, the apiary site\r\nshould be one in which the hives are well protected from wind, and it\r\nis advantageous if the apiary grounds slope toward the south in order\r\nthat the bees may have the fullest advantage of heat from the sun. If\r\nthe bees have been wintered in the cellar in double-walled hives they\r\nwill have the advantage of some protection when they are taken from\r\nthe cellar. The beekeeper may feel safe in giving the bees all the\r\nprotection possible at the time that they are taken from the cellar,\r\nknowing that it is impossible at this time or any other to insulate the\r\nhive too well.\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether the hives should be packed in the spring the\r\nbeekeeper should be governed largely by the condition of the bees. If\r\nthey have wintered well they will be able to stand greater extremes of\r\ntemperature in the spring without loss, but if they have been wintered\r\nin a cold cellar they will be greatly injured by cold weather after\r\nthey have been set out. Of course, the need of protection is determined\r\nchiefly by the kind of weather prevailing during the first few weeks\r\nafter the bees have been taken from the cellar. In some seasons the\r\nweather is so fine that the bees would be little benefited by packing\r\nor other protection, but the beekeeper can not influence the weather,\r\nand the only safe plan is so to place the bees that if the weather\r\ndoes turn cold they will still be safe. Here, as everywhere else in\r\nbeekeeping, it pays to be on the safe side, so far as protecting the\r\nbees is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVIDING BREEDING ROOM AND STORES IN THE SPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the main honey-flow is past it is usually desirable that each\r\ncolony be kept in two hive bodies of full depth. Most producers of\r\nextracted honey do this, but too many producers of comb-honey are not\r\nadequately supplied with hive bodies and do not give the second body.\r\nThese two hive bodies should be left with the bees at least until\r\nbrood-rearing ceases, and at this time one of them should be removed if\r\nthe bees are to be wintered in the cellar. As has been pointed out in\r\nother bulletins of the department, if the bees are wintered outdoors\r\nthey will do better in the two hive bodies throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nIn the upper hive body will be found a considerable amount of the\r\nhoney to be used by the bees up to the time of the next honey-flow.\r\nUsually there will be enough in the lower hive body for the bees while\r\nthey are in the cellar, especially where comb-honey is produced, but\r\nif the lower hive body is not adequately supplied with winter stores\r\n(perhaps 15 to 20 pounds) the beekeeper should move some of the stores.\r\nIt is also a good practice to winter the bees in the cellar in a hive\r\ncontaining the full stores, except that this makes it necessary to\r\ncarry in hives weighing perhaps 80 pounds.\r\n\r\nAfter the second hive bodies have been removed, if they contain honey\r\nthey should be stored in a warm, dry place, where the honey will not\r\nbe injured. If it is possible to place such hive bodies in the furnace\r\nroom of the residence, this will be found to be ideal. If no such\r\nplace is available, the beekeeper may keep these in a dry cellar or\r\nother location where the honey will not be exposed to rapid changes\r\nin temperature. For this purpose a place suitable for the storage of\r\ncomb-honey is desirable. It should be pointed out that the honey in\r\nthese combs should not be extracted. It will be needed for the building\r\nup of the colonies the next spring, and to remove it is simply to\r\nreduce the crop of the next season.\r\n\r\nSome time within two weeks after the bees have been taken from the\r\ncellar, depending on the weather, each colony should be provided with\r\nits second hive body. Preferably, this should be placed underneath the\r\nhive body in which the bees were wintered in order that the propolis\r\nat the top of the hive may not be broken. At this time an examination\r\nof the colonies may be made from below to see whether any of them\r\nare queenless or require immediate attention for other reasons, but\r\nat this season there is little that the beekeeper can do that will\r\nhelp the bees other than to provide them with room for the brood and\r\nwith adequate supplies of stores. Queens should not be clipped at\r\nthis time, and usually not until settled weather has arrived. Further\r\nspring manipulation is not necessary and the bees are better off if the\r\nbeekeeper lets them alone.\r\n\r\nIf the bees have been requeened at the proper time and if the total\r\namount of stores is given as indicated, it will not be worth while\r\nto go through the bees to look for queenless colonies. The beekeeper\r\nshould see to it that at least 45 pounds of honey are provided for\r\neach colony from the time of the last honey-flow in the fall to the\r\nbeginning of the first main honey-flow of the following season. If this\r\nis not given in full, the beekeeper may be sure that the crop of the\r\nfollowing year will be reduced. This amount of honey left for the use\r\nof the bees is a better investment for the beekeeper than money in the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out that the giving of a second hive body in the\r\nspring is not simply a means of supplying additional stores, but more\r\nthan one hive body will be needed for the development of the brood. A\r\nsingle 10-frame Langstroth hive is not large enough for the development\r\nof a good colony of bees, which, before the beginning of the main honey\r\nflow, should have brood to fill at least 12 frames.\r\n\r\nAs was stated earlier in this bulletin, a colony of bees from one\r\nseason to the next needs three things in abundance--room for the\r\ndevelopment of the brood, stores of good quality, and protection from\r\nwind and cold. In cellar wintering the protection is given by putting\r\nthe bees in the cellar; the room and stores must be supplied later or\r\nthe population of the colony will be reduced at the critical time of\r\nthe honey-flow. If the early sources of honey are abundant, the amount\r\nof honey advised will not be consumed. The wise beekeeper, however,\r\ndoes not gamble on the early honey-flows, but invests this honey as\r\nlife insurance for his bees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURES OF SUCCESS IN CELLAR WINTERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is often difficult for the beekeeper to know whether his bee\r\ncellar is giving the best results, for he may not have been able to\r\ndetermine from reading or the observation of other cellars whether it\r\nis satisfactory. The writers, therefore, have attempted below to give\r\na few measures which the beekeeper may apply to his apiary and his\r\ncellar, so that he may be able to decide whether his methods of cellar\r\nwintering should be improved.\r\n\r\n(1) During the winter a thermometer inserted in the entrance of the\r\nhive should show a temperature of at least 52° F.\r\n\r\n(2) There should never be any condensed moisture on the covers of the\r\nhives, and certainly never any on the bottoms.\r\n\r\n(3) While, the cellar should be kept dark at all times, if a candle\r\nis held at the entrance of a hive at the end of January it should be\r\nseveral seconds before any of the bees break cluster. Frequently the\r\ncellar doors may be opened in March without disturbing the bees.\r\n\r\n(4) There should never be many dead bees on the bottom of the hives.\r\nThe live bees should be able to push them out as they die during the\r\nwinter. The bees thus carried out will be found on the cellar floor\r\njust below the entrances. If there are bees all over the floor, it\r\nshows that these bees have flown from the hives--an indication of poor\r\nwintering.\r\n\r\n(5) The bees should be quiet during the late winter. Noise at this time\r\nindicates that the bees are disturbed by an accumulation of feces,\r\ncaused by low temperatures or poor food.\r\n\r\n(6) If the bees were in good condition in the fall and have been\r\nwintered well, the loss during the winter will never be more than\r\none-sixth of the total population of the hive. Such a loss is\r\nexcessive, however, and in a well-wintered colony it may be as low as\r\na hundred bees. This probably depends to a large extent on the age of\r\nthe bees which go into winter, and if the temperature is right and the\r\nstores good there will be almost no loss of vigorous bees.\r\n\r\n(7) The bees should not leave the hive while they are being carried\r\nfrom the cellar. If they do, it indicates that they are excited by an\r\naccumulation of feces.\r\n\r\n(8) Before removal from the cellar there should be no spotting of the\r\nhives from dysentery. There may be a little spotting after the bees\r\nhave had a free flight outside, but if this is small in amount it does\r\nnot indicate a serious condition.\r\n\r\n(9) When the bees are taken from the cellar there should be no moldy\r\ncombs, for the cellar at the right temperature will be too dry for the\r\ngrowth of molds.\r\n\r\n(10) There should be no brood when the colonies are taken from the\r\ncellar. Brood-rearing in the cellar is proof that the cellar is too\r\ncold or that the food used by the bees is inferior.\r\n\r\n(11) Enough brood should be in each colony at the opening of the main\r\nhoney-flow to fill completely 12 Langstroth frames.\r\n\r\n(12) The population of the hive should not decrease appreciably after\r\nthe bees are removed from the cellar. Such a condition, known as spring\r\ndwindling, is an indication of poor wintering. For three weeks after\r\nthe hives are set out no new bees will be emerging, but the loss of\r\nbees during this time should be so small as not to be noticeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT TO THE FARMERS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n[Extracts from President Wilson's message to the Farmers' Conference at\r\nUrbana, Ill., January 31, 1918.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forces that fight for freedom, the freedom of men all over the\r\nworld as well as our own, depend upon us in an extraordinary and\r\nunexpected degree for sustenance, for the supply of the materials by\r\nwhich men are to live and to fight, and it will be our glory when the\r\nwar is over that we have supplied those materials and supplied them\r\nabundantly, and it will be all the more glory because in supplying them\r\nwe have made our supreme effort and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn the field of agriculture we have agencies and instrumentalities,\r\nfortunately, such as no other government in the world can show. The\r\nDepartment of Agriculture is undoubtedly the greatest practical and\r\nscientific agricultural organization in the world. Its total annual\r\nbudget of $46,000,000 has been increased during the last four years\r\nmore than 72 per cent. It has a staff of 18,000, including a large\r\nnumber, of highly trained experts, and alongside of it stands the\r\nunique land grant colleges, which are without example elsewhere, and\r\nthe 69 State and Federal experiment stations. These colleges and\r\nexperiment stations have a total endowment of plant and equipment\r\nof $172,000,000 and an income of more than $35,000,000 with 10,271\r\nteachers, a resident student body of 125,000, and a vast additional\r\nnumber receiving instructions at their homes. County agents, joint\r\nofficers of the Department of Agriculture and of the colleges, are\r\neverywhere cooperating with the farmers and assisting them. The\r\nnumber of extension workers under the Smith-Lever Act and under the\r\nrecent emergency legislation has grown to 5,500 men and women working\r\nregularly in the various communities and taking to the farmer the\r\nlatest scientific and practical information. Alongside these great\r\npublic agencies stand the very effective voluntary organizations among\r\nthe farmers themselves which are more and more learning the best\r\nmethods of cooperation and the best methods of putting to practical\r\nuse the assistance derived from governmental sources. The banking\r\nlegislation of the last two or three years has given the farmers access\r\nto the great lendable capital of the country, and it has become the\r\nduty both of the men in charge of the Federal Reserve Banking System\r\nand of the Farm Loan Banking System to see to it that the farmers\r\nobtain the credit, both short term and long term, to which they are\r\nentitled not only, but which it is imperatively necessary should\r\nbe extended to them if the present tasks of the country are to be\r\nadequately performed. Both by direct purchase of nitrates and by the\r\nestablishment of plants to produce nitrates, the Government is doing\r\nits utmost to assist in the problem of fertilization. The Department\r\nof Agriculture and other agencies are actively assisting the farmers to\r\nlocate, safeguard, and secure at cost an adequate supply of sound seed.\r\n\r\nThe farmers of this country are as efficient as any other farmers\r\nin the world. They do not produce more per acre than the farmers in\r\nEurope. It is not necessary that they should do so. It would perhaps\r\nbe bad economy for them to attempt it. But they do produce by two to\r\nthree or four times more per man, per unit of labor and capital, than\r\nthe farmers of any European country. They are more alert and use more\r\nlabor-saving devices than any other farmers in the world. And their\r\nresponse to the demands of the present emergency has been in every way\r\nremarkable. Last spring their planting exceeded by 12,000,000 acres\r\nthe largest planting of any previous year, and the yields from the\r\ncrops were record-breaking yields. In the fall of 1917 a wheat acreage\r\nof 42,170,000 was planted, which was 1,000,000 larger than for any\r\npreceding year, 3,000,000 greater than the next largest, and 7,000,000\r\ngreater than the preceding five-year average.\r\n\r\nBut I ought to say to you that it is not only necessary that these\r\nachievements should be repeated, but that they should be exceeded.\r\nI know what this advice involves. It involves not only labor but\r\nsacrifice, the painstaking application of every bit of scientific\r\nknowledge and every tested practice that is available. It means the\r\nutmost economy, even to the point where the pinch comes. It means the\r\nkind of concentration and self-sacrifice which is involved in the\r\nfield of battle itself, where the object always looms greater than the\r\nindividual. And yet the Government will help and help in every way that\r\nit is possible.\r\n\r\nIt was farmers from whom came the first shots at Lexington, that set\r\naflame the Revolution that made America free. I hope and believe that\r\nthe farmers of America will willingly and conspicuously stand by to win\r\nthis war also. The toil, the intelligence, the energy, the foresight,\r\nthe self-sacrifice, and devotion of the farmers of America will, I\r\nbelieve, bring to a triumphant conclusion this great last war for the\r\nemancipation of men from the control of arbitrary government and the\r\nselfishness of class legislation and control, and then, when the end\r\nhas come, we may look each other in the face and be glad that we are\r\nAmericans and have had the privilege to play such a part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n[Extracts from addresses.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next great factor to enlist for the betterment of Agriculture\r\nand rural life in this Nation is the business man of the town and\r\nthe city. He has not always been alive to his obligations. He has\r\ncontented himself, in too many instances, with plans to secure profit\r\nin agricultural trade, instead of sympathetically and eagerly planning\r\nconstructive assistance. This duty, pressing in peace time, is of the\r\nmost urgent and impelling character in this crisis; and I appeal to the\r\nbankers and business men to see that they omit no effort to familiarize\r\nthemselves with the agencies serving to aid the farmers and to promote\r\nwise plans to secure the necessary results.\r\n\r\nD. F. Houston, Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interest of our national development at all times and in the\r\ninterest of war efficiency just now our agriculture must be well\r\nmaintained. It should be remembered that the agricultural unit is\r\na small unit. There are 6,000,000 farms in this country, each an\r\nindividual unit. It is to the interest of persons who do not live on\r\nfarms, even more than to the interest of those who do live on farms,\r\nthat production shall be kept up. This means that all people, not\r\nfarmers alone, but those who live in cities as well as the farmers,\r\nare interested in experimental and educational activities along\r\nagricultural lines as conducted by the Federal Government and the\r\nStates. These efforts should be liberally supported.\r\n\r\nR. A. Pearson, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a time like this no man has a moral right, whatever his fortune\r\nmay he, to employ another man to render any service of mere comfort\r\nor convenience. When the finest young men of the United States are\r\nin France digging ditches, sawing lumber, laying rails, and playing\r\nwith death, and when the finest young women of the United States are\r\nscrubbing floors in hospitals, it is a sin that almost approaches the\r\nunpardonable offense against civilization for any man or women in the\r\nUnited States to engage in a wasteful or unnecessary service.\r\n\r\nClarence Ousley, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note",
