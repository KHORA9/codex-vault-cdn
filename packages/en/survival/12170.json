Over it the moon was\r\nrising, like a red pulsating ball, lighting up the vast white silence of\r\nthe night in a shimmering glow. Not a sound broke the stillness of the\r\ndesolation. It was too late for the life of day, too early for the\r\nnocturnal roamings and voices of the creatures of the night. Like the\r\nbasin of a great amphitheater the frozen lake lay revealed in the light\r\nof the moon and a billion stars. Beyond it rose the spruce forest, black\r\nand forbidding. Along its nearer edges stood hushed walls of tamarack,\r\nbowed in the smothering clutch of snow and ice, shut in by impenetrable\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nA huge white owl flitted out of this rim of blackness, then back again,\r\nand its first quavering hoot came softly, as though the mystic hour of\r\nsilence had not yet passed for the night-folk. The snow of the day had\r\nceased, hardly a breath of air stirred the ice-coated twigs of the\r\ntrees. Yet it was bitter cold--so cold that a man, remaining motionless,\r\nwould have frozen to death within an hour.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a break in the silence, a weird, thrilling sound,\r\nlike a great sigh, but not human--a sound to make one's blood run faster\r\nand fingers twitch on rifle-stock. It came from the gloom of the\r\ntamaracks. After it there fell a deeper silence than before, and the\r\nowl, like a noiseless snowflake, drifted out over the frozen lake. After\r\na few moments it came again, more faintly than before. One versed in\r\nwoodcraft would have slunk deeper into the rim of blackness, and\r\nlistened, and wondered, and watched; for in the sound he would have\r\nrecognized the wild, half-conquered note of a wounded beast's suffering\r\nand agony.\r\n\r\nSlowly, with all the caution born of that day's experience, a huge bull\r\nmoose walked out into the glow of the moon. His magnificent head,\r\ndrooping under the weight of massive antlers, was turned inquisitively\r\nacross the lake to the north. His nostrils were distended, his eyes\r\nglaring, and he left behind a trail of blood. Half a mile away he caught\r\nthe edge of the spruce forest. There something told him he would find\r\nsafety. A hunter would have known that he was wounded unto death as he\r\ndragged himself out into the foot-deep snow of the lake.\r\n\r\nA dozen rods out from the tamaracks he stopped, head thrown high, long\r\nears pitched forward, and nostrils held half to the sky. It is in this\r\nattitude that a moose listens when he hears a trout splash\r\nthree-quarters of a mile away. Now there was only the vast, unending\r\nsilence, broken only by the mournful hoot of the snow owl on the other\r\nside of the lake. Still the great beast stood immovable, a little pool\r\nof blood growing upon the snow under his forward legs. What was the\r\nmystery that lurked in the blackness of yonder forest? Was it danger?\r\nThe keenest of human hearing would have detected nothing. Yet to those\r\nlong slender ears of the bull moose, slanting beyond the heavy plates of\r\nhis horns, there came a sound. The animal lifted his head still higher\r\nto the sky, sniffed to the east, to the west, and back to the shadows of\r\nthe tamaracks. But it was the north that held him.\r\n\r\nFrom beyond that barrier of spruce there soon came a sound that man\r\nmight have heard--neither the beginning nor the end of a wail, but\r\nsomething like it. Minute by minute it came more clearly, now growing in\r\nvolume, now almost dying away, but every instant approaching--the\r\ndistant hunting call of the wolf-pack! What the hangman's noose is to\r\nthe murderer, what the leveled rifles are to the condemned spy, that\r\nhunt-cry of the wolves is to the wounded animal of the forests.\r\n\r\nInstinct taught this to the old bull. His head dropped, his huge antlers\r\nleveled themselves with his shoulders, and he set off at a slow trot\r\ntoward the east. He was taking chances in thus crossing the open, but to\r\nhim the spruce forest was home, and there he might find refuge. In his\r\nbrute brain he reasoned that he could get there before the wolves broke\r\ncover. And then--\r\n\r\nAgain he stopped, so suddenly that his forward legs doubled under him\r\nand he pitched into the snow. This time, from the direction of the\r\nwolf-pack, there came the ringing report of a rifle! It might have been\r\na mile or two miles away, but distance did not lessen the fear it\r\nbrought to the dying king of the North. That day he had heard the same\r\nsound, and it had brought mysterious and weakening pain in his vitals.\r\nWith a supreme effort he brought himself to his feet, once more sniffed\r\ninto the north, the east, and the west, then turned and buried himself\r\nin the black and frozen wilderness of tamarack.\r\n\r\nStillness fell again with the sound of the rifle-shot. It might have\r\nlasted five minutes or ten, when a long, solitary howl floated from\r\nacross the lake. It ended in the sharp, quick yelp of a wolf on the\r\ntrail, and an instant later was taken up by others, until the pack was\r\nonce more in full cry. Almost simultaneously a figure darted out upon\r\nthe ice from the edge of the forest. A dozen paces and it paused and\r\nturned back toward the black wall of spruce.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming, Wabi?\"\r\n\r\nA voice answered from the woods. \"Yes. Hurry up--run!\"\r\n\r\nThus urged, the other turned his face once more across the lake. He was\r\na youth of not more than eighteen. In his right hand he carried a club.\r\nHis left arm, as if badly injured, was done up in a sling improvised\r\nfrom a lumberman's heavy scarf. His face was scratched and bleeding, and\r\nhis whole appearance showed that he was nearing complete exhaustion. For\r\na few moments he ran through the snow, then halted to a staggering walk.\r\nHis breath came in painful gasps. The club slipped from his nerveless\r\nfingers, and conscious of the deathly weakness that was overcoming him\r\nhe did not attempt to regain it. Foot by foot he struggled on, until\r\nsuddenly his knees gave way under him and he sank down into the snow.\r\n\r\nFrom the edge of the spruce forest a young Indian now ran out upon the\r\nsurface of the lake. His breath was coming quickly, but with excitement\r\nrather than fatigue. Behind him, less than half a mile away, he could\r\nhear the rapidly approaching cry of the hunt-pack, and for an instant he\r\nbent his lithe form close to the snow, measuring with the acuteness of\r\nhis race the distance of the pursuers. Then he looked for his white\r\ncompanion, and failed to see the motionless blot that marked where the\r\nother had fallen. A look of alarm shot into his eyes, and resting his\r\nrifle between his knees he placed his hands, trumpet fashion, to his\r\nmouth and gave a signal call which, on a still night like this, carried\r\nfor a mile.\r\n\r\n\"Wa-hoo-o-o-o-o-o! Wa-hoo-o-o-o-o-o!\"\r\n\r\nAt that cry the exhausted boy in the snow staggered to his feet, and\r\nwith an answering shout which came but faintly to the ears of the\r\nIndian, resumed his flight across the lake. Two or three minutes later\r\nWabi came up beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Can you make it, Rod?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe other made an effort to answer, but his reply was hardly more than a\r\ngasp. Before Wabi could reach out to support him he had lost his little\r\nremaining strength and fallen for a second time into the snow.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid--I--can't do it--Wabi,\" he whispered. \"I'm--bushed--\"\r\n\r\nThe young Indian dropped his rifle and knelt beside the wounded boy,\r\nsupporting his head against his own heaving shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a little farther, Rod,\" he urged. \"We can make it, and take\r\nto a tree. We ought to have taken to a tree back there, but I didn't\r\nknow that you were so far gone; and there was a good chance to make\r\ncamp, with three cartridges left for the open lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only three!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all, but I ought to make two of them count in this light. Here,\r\ntake hold of my shoulders! Quick!\"\r\n\r\nHe doubled himself like a jack-knife in front of his half-prostrate\r\ncompanion. From behind them there came a sudden chorus of the wolves,\r\nlouder and clearer than before.\r\n\r\n\"They've hit the open and we'll have them on the lake inside of two\r\nminutes,\" he cried. \"Give me your arms, Rod! There! Can you hold the\r\ngun?\"\r\n\r\nHe straightened himself, staggering under the other's weight, and set\r\noff on a half-trot for the distant tamaracks. Every muscle in his\r\npowerful young body was strained to its utmost tension. Even more fully\r\nthan his helpless burden did he realize the peril at their backs.\r\n\r\nThree minutes, four minutes more, and then--\r\n\r\nA terrible picture burned in Wabi's brain, a picture he had carried from\r\nboyhood of another child, torn and mangled before his very eyes by these\r\noutlaws of the North, and he shuddered. Unless he sped those three\r\nremaining bullets true, unless that rim of tamaracks was reached in\r\ntime, he knew what their fate would be. There flashed into his mind one\r\nlast resource. He might drop his wounded companion and find safety for\r\nhimself. But it was a thought that made Wabi smile grimly. This was not\r\nthe first time that these two had risked their lives together, and that\r\nvery day Roderick had fought valiantly for the other, and had been the\r\none to suffer. If they died, it would be in company. Wabi made up his\r\nmind to that and clutched the other's arms in a firmer grip. He was\r\npretty certain that death faced them both. They might escape the wolves,\r\nbut the refuge of a tree, with the voracious pack on guard below, meant\r\nonly a more painless end by cold. Still, while there was life there was\r\nhope, and he hurried on through the snow, listening for the wolves\r\nbehind him and with each moment feeling more keenly that his own powers\r\nof endurance were rapidly reaching an end.\r\n\r\nFor some reason that Wabi could not explain the hunt-pack had ceased to\r\ngive tongue. Not only the allotted two minutes, but five of them, passed\r\nwithout the appearance of the animals on the lake. Was it possible that\r\nthey! had lost the trail? Then it occurred to the Indian that perhaps he\r\nhad wounded one of the pursuers, and that the others, discovering his\r\ninjury, had set upon him and were now participating in one of the\r\ncannibalistic feasts that had saved them thus far. Hardly had he thought\r\nof this possibility when he was thrilled by a series of long howls, and\r\nlooking back he discerned a dozen or more dark objects moving swiftly\r\nover their trail.\r\n\r\nNot an eighth of a mile ahead was the tamarack forest. Surely Rod could\r\ntravel that distance!\r\n\r\n\"Run for it, Rod!\" he cried. \"You're rested now. I'll stay here and\r\nstop 'em!\"\r\n\r\nHe loosened the other's arms, and as he did so his rifle fell from the\r\nwhite boy's nerveless grip and buried itself in the snow. As he relieved\r\nhimself of his burden he saw for the first time the deathly pallor and\r\npartly closed eyes of his companion. With a new terror filling his own\r\nfaithful heart he knelt beside the form which lay so limp and lifeless,\r\nhis blazing eyes traveling from the ghastly face to the oncoming wolves,\r\nhis rifle ready in his hands. He could now discern the wolves trailing\r\nout from the spruce forest like ants. A dozen of them were almost within\r\nrifle-shot. Wabi knew that it was with this vanguard of the pack that he\r\nmust deal if he succeeded in stopping the scores behind. Nearer and\r\nnearer he allowed them to come, until the first were scarce two hundred\r\nfeet away. Then, with a sudden shout, the Indian leaped to his feet and\r\ndashed fearlessly toward them. This unexpected move, as he had intended,\r\nstopped the foremost wolves in a huddled group for an instant, and in\r\nthis opportune moment Wabi leveled his gun and fired. A long howl of\r\npain testified to the effect of the shot. Hardly had it begun when Wabi\r\nfired again, this time with such deadly precision that one of the\r\nwolves, springing high into the air, tumbled back lifeless among the\r\npack without so much as making a sound.\r\n\r\nRunning to the prostrate Roderick, Wabi drew him quickly upon his back,\r\nclutched his rifle in the grip of his arm, and started again for the\r\ntamaracks. Only once did he look back, and then he saw the wolves\r\ngathering in a snarling, fighting crowd about their slaughtered\r\ncomrades. Not until he had reached the shelter of the tamaracks did the\r\nIndian youth lay down his burden, and then in his own exhaustion he fell\r\nprone upon the snow, his black eyes fixed cautiously upon the feasting\r\npack. A few minutes later he discerned dark spots appearing here and\r\nthere upon the whiteness of the snow, and at these signs of the\r\ntermination of the feast he climbed up into the low branches of a spruce\r\nand drew Roderick after him. Not until then did the wounded boy show\r\nvisible signs of life. Slowly he recovered from the faintness which had\r\noverpowered him, and after a little, with some assistance from Wabi, was\r\nable to place himself safely on a higher limb.\r\n\r\n\"That's the second time, Wabi,\" he said, reaching a hand down\r\naffectionately to the other's shoulder. \"Once from drowning, once from\r\nthe wolves. I've got a lot to even up with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not after what happened to-day!\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian's dusky face was raised until the two were looking into each\r\nother's eyes, with a gaze of love, and trust. Only a moment thus, and\r\ninstinctively their glance turned toward the lake. The wolf-pack was in\r\nplain view. It was the biggest pack that Wabi, in all his life in the\r\nwilderness, had ever seen, and he mentally figured that there were at\r\nleast half a hundred animals in it. Like ravenous dogs after having a\r\nfew scraps of meat flung among them, the wolves were running about,\r\nnosing here and there, as if hoping to find a morsel that might have\r\nescaped discovery. Then one of them stopped on the trail and, throwing\r\nhimself half on his haunches, with his head turned to the sky like a\r\nbaying hound, started the hunt-cry.\r\n\r\n\"There's two packs. I thought it was too big for one,\" exclaimed the\r\nIndian. \"See! Part of them are taking up the trail and the others are\r\nlagging behind gnawing the bones of the dead wolf. Now if we only had\r\nour ammunition and the other gun those murderers got away from us, we'd\r\nmake a fortune. What--\"\r\n\r\nWabi stopped with a suddenness that spoke volumes, and the supporting\r\narm that he had thrown around Rod's waist tightened until it caused the\r\nwounded youth to flinch. Both boys stared in rigid silence. The wolves\r\nwere crowding around a spot in the snow half-way between the tamarack\r\nrefuge and the scene of the recent feast. The starved animals betrayed\r\nunusual excitement. They had struck the pool of blood and red trail made\r\nby the dying moose!\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Wabi?\" whispered Rod.\r\n\r\nThe Indian did not answer. His black eyes gleamed with a new fire, his\r\nlips were parted in anxious anticipation, and he seemed hardly to\r\nbreathe in his tense interest. The wounded boy repeated his question,\r\nand as if in reply the pack swerved to the west and in a black silent\r\nmass swept in a direction that would bring them into the tamaracks a\r\nhundred yards from the young hunters.\r\n\r\n\"A new trail!\" breathed Wabi. \"A new trail, and a hot one! Listen! They\r\nmake no sound. It is always that way when they are close to a kill!\"\r\n\r\nAs they looked the last of the wolves disappeared in the forest. For a\r\nfew moments there was silence, then a chorus of howls came from deep in\r\nthe woods behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Now is our chance,\" cried the Indian. \"They've broken again, and their\r\ngame--\"\r\n\r\nHe had partly slipped from his limb, withdrawing his supporting arm from\r\nRod's waist, and was about to descend to the ground when the pack again\r\nturned in their direction. A heavy crashing in the underbrush not a\r\ndozen rods away sent Wabi in a hurried scramble for his perch.\r\n\r\n\"Quick--higher up!\" he warned excitedly. \"They're coming out here--right\r\nunder us! If we can get up so that they can't see us, or smell us--\"\r\n\r\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth when a huge shadowy bulk rushed\r\npast them not more than fifty feet from the spruce in which they had\r\nsought refuge. Both of the boys recognized it as a bull moose, though it\r\ndid not occur to either of them that it was the same animal at which\r\nWabi had taken a long shot that same day a couple of miles back. In\r\nclose pursuit came the ravenous pack. Their heads hung close to the\r\nbloody trail, hungry, snarling cries coming from between their gaping\r\njaws, they swept across the little opening almost at the young hunters'\r\nfeet. It was a sight which Rod had never expected to see, and one which\r\nheld even the more experienced Wabi fascinated. Not a sound fell from\r\neither of the youths' lips as they stared down upon the fierce, hungry\r\noutlaws of the wilderness. To Wabi this near view of the pack told a\r\nfateful story; to Rod it meant nothing more than the tragedy about to be\r\nenacted before his eyes. The Indian's keen vision saw in the white\r\nmoonlight long, thin bodies, starved almost to skin and bone; to his\r\ncompanion the onrushing pack seemed filled only with agile, powerful\r\nbeasts, maddened to almost fiendish exertions by the nearness of their\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nIn a flash they were gone, but in that moment of their passing there was\r\npainted a picture to endure a lifetime in the memory of Roderick Drew.\r\nAnd it was to be followed by one even more tragic, even more thrilling.\r\nTo the dazed, half-fainting young hunter it seemed but another instant\r\nbefore the pack overhauled the old bull. He saw the doomed monster turn,\r\nin the stillness heard the snapping of jaws, the snarling of\r\nhunger-crazed animals, and a sound that might have been a great, heaving\r\nmoan or a dying bellow. In Wabi's veins the blood danced with the\r\nexcitement that stirred his forefathers to battle. Not a line of the\r\ntragedy that was being enacted before his eyes escaped this native son\r\nof the wilderness. It was a magnificent fight! He knew that the old bull\r\nwould die by inches in the one-sided duel, and that when it was over\r\nthere would be more than one carcass for the survivors to gorge\r\nthemselves upon. Quietly he reached up and touched his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Now is our time,\" he said. \"Come on--still--and on this side of the\r\ntree!\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped down, foot by foot, assisting Rod as he did so, and when both\r\nhad reached the ground he bent over as before, that the other might get\r\nupon his back.\r\n\r\n\"I can make it alone, Wabi,\" whispered the wounded boy. \"Give me a lift\r\non the arm, will you?\"\r\n\r\nWith the Indian's arm about his waist, the two set off into the\r\ntamaracks. Fifteen minutes later they came to the bank of a small frozen\r\nriver. On the opposite side of this, a hundred yards down, was a sight\r\nwhich both, as if by a common impulse, welcomed with a glad cry. Close\r\nto the shore, sheltered by a dense growth of spruce, was a bright\r\ncamp-fire. In response to Wabi's far-reaching whoop a shadowy figure\r\nappeared in the glow and returned the shout.\r\n\r\n\"Mukoki!\" cried the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Mukoki!\" laughed Rod, happy that the end was near.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke he swayed dizzily, and Wabi dropped his gun that he\r\nmight keep his companion from falling into the snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHOW WABIGOON BECAME A WHITE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the young hunters the power of looking into the future, their\r\ncamp-fire that night on the frozen Ombabika might have been one of their\r\nlast, and a few days later would have seen them back on the edges of\r\ncivilization. Possibly, could they have foreseen the happy culmination\r\nof the adventures that lay before them, they would still have gone on,\r\nfor the love of excitement is strong in the heart of robust youth. But\r\nthis power of discernment was denied them, and only in after years, with\r\nthe loved ones of their own firesides close about them, was the whole\r\npicture revealed. And in those days, when they would gather with their\r\nfamilies about the roaring logs of winter and live over again their\r\nearly youth, they knew that all the gold in the world would not induce\r\nthem to part with their memories of the life that had gone before.\r\n\r\nA little less than thirty years previous to the time of which we write,\r\na young man named John Newsome left the great city of London for the New\r\nWorld. Fate had played a hard game with young Newsome--had first robbed\r\nhim of both parents, and then in a single fitful turn of her wheel\r\ndeprived him of what little property he had inherited. A little later he\r\ncame to Montreal, and being a youth of good education and considerable\r\nambition, he easily secured a position and worked himself into the\r\nconfidence of his employers, obtaining an appointment as factor at\r\nWabinosh House, a Post deep in the wilderness of Lake Nipigon.\r\n\r\nIn the second year of his reign at Wabinosh--a factor is virtually king\r\nin his domain--there came to the Post an Indian chief named Wabigoon,\r\nand with him his daughter, Minnetaki, in honor of whose beauty and\r\nvirtue a town was named in after years. Minnetaki was just budding into\r\nthe early womanhood of her race, and possessed a beauty seldom seen\r\namong Indian maidens. If there is such a thing as love at first sight,\r\nit sprang into existence the moment John Newsome's eyes fell upon this\r\nlovely princess. Thereafter his visits to Wabigoon's village, thirty\r\nmiles deeper in the wilderness, were of frequent occurrence. From the\r\nbeginning Minnetaki returned the young factor's affections, but a most\r\npotent reason prevented their marriage. For a long time Minnetaki had\r\nbeen ardently wooed by a powerful young chief named Woonga, whom she\r\ncordially detested, but upon whose favor and friendship depended the\r\nexistence of her father's sway over his hunting-grounds.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the young factor the bitterest rivalry sprang up\r\nbetween the two suitors, which resulted in two attempts upon Newsome's\r\nlife, and an ultimatum sent by Woonga to Minnetaki's father. Minnetaki\r\nherself replied to this ultimatum. It was a reply that stirred the fires\r\nof hatred and revenge to fever heat in Woonga's breast. One dark night,\r\nat the head of a score of his tribe, he fell upon Wabigoon's camp, his\r\nobject being the abduction of the princess. While the attack was\r\nsuccessful in a way, its main purpose failed. Wabigoon and a dozen of\r\nhis tribesmen were slain, but in the end Woonga was driven off.\r\n\r\nA swift messenger brought news of the attack and of the old chief's\r\ndeath to Wabinosh House, and with a dozen men Newsome hastened to the\r\nassistance of his betrothed and her people. A counter attack was made\r\nupon Woonga and he was driven deep into the wilderness with great loss.\r\nThree days later Minnetaki became Newsome's wife at the Hudson Bay Post.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour dated one of the most sanguinary feuds in the history of\r\nthe great trading company; a feud which, as we shall see, was destined\r\nto live even unto the second generation.\r\n\r\nWoonga and his tribe now became no better than outlaws, and preyed so\r\neffectively upon the remnants of the dead Wabigoon's people that the\r\nlatter were almost exterminated. Those who were left moved to the\r\nvicinity of the Post. Hunters from Wabinosh House were ambushed and\r\nslain. Indians who came to the Post to trade were regarded as enemies,\r\nand the passing of years seemed to make but little difference. The feud\r\nstill existed. The outlaws came to be spoken of as \"Woongas,\" and a\r\nWoonga was regarded as a fair target for any man's rifle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of Newsome and his\r\nlovely Indian wife. One of these, the eldest, was a boy, and in honor of\r\nthe old chief he was named Wabigoon, and called Wabi for short. The\r\nother was a girl, three years younger, and Newsome insisted that she be\r\ncalled Minnetaki. Curiously enough, the blood of Wabi ran almost pure to\r\nhis Indian forefathers, while Minnetaki, as she became older, developed\r\nless of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the softer loveliness\r\nof the white race, her wealth of soft, jet black hair and her great dark\r\neyes contrasting with the lighter skin of her father's blood. Wabi, on\r\nthe other hand, was an Indian in appearance from his moccasins to the\r\ncrown of his head, swarthy, sinewy, as agile as a lynx, and with every\r\ninstinct in him crying for the life of the wild. Yet born in him was a\r\nCaucasian shrewdness and intelligence that reached beyond the factor\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOne of Newsome's chief pleasures in life had been the educating of his\r\nwoodland bride, and it was the ambition of both that the little\r\nMinnetaki and her brother be reared in the ways of white children.\r\nConsequently both mother and father began their education at the Post;\r\nthey were sent to the factor's school and two winters were passed in\r\nPort Arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equipped\r\nschools. The children proved themselves unusually bright pupils, and by\r\nthe time Wabi was sixteen and Minnetaki twelve one would not have known\r\nfrom their manner of speech that Indian blood ran in their veins. Yet\r\nboth, by the common desire of their parents, were familiar with the life\r\nof the Indian and could talk fluently the tongue of their mother's\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt was at about this time in their lives that the Woongas became\r\nespecially daring in their depredations. These outlaws no longer\r\npretended to earn their livelihood by honest means, but preyed upon\r\ntrappers and other Indians without discrimination, robbing and killing\r\nwhenever safe opportunities offered themselves. The hatred for the\r\npeople of Wabinosh House became hereditary, and the Woonga children grew\r\nup with it in their hearts. The real cause of the feud had been\r\nforgotten by many, though not by Woonga himself. At last so daring did\r\nhe become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head\r\nand upon those of a number of his most notorious followers. For a time\r\nthe outlaws were driven from the country, but the bloodthirsty chief\r\nhimself could not be captured.\r\n\r\nWhen Wabi was seventeen years of age it was decided that he should be\r\nsent to some big school in the States for a year. Against this plan the\r\nyoung Indian--nearly all people regarded him as an Indian, and Wabi was\r\nproud of the fact--fought with all of the arguments at his command. He\r\nloved the wilds with the passion of his mother's race. His nature\r\nrevolted at the thoughts of a great city with its crowded streets, its\r\nnoise, and bustle, and dirt. It was then that Minnetaki pleaded with\r\nhim, begged him to go for just one year, and to come back and tell her\r\nof all he had seen and teach her what he had learned. Wabi loved his\r\nbeautiful little sister beyond anything else on earth, and it was she\r\nmore than his parents who finally induced him to go.\r\n\r\nFor three months Wabi devoted himself faithfully to his studies in\r\nDetroit. But each week added to his loneliness and his longings for\r\nMinnetaki and his forests. The passing of each day became a painful task\r\nto him. To Minnetaki he wrote three times each week, and three times\r\neach week the little maiden at Wabinosh House wrote long, cheering\r\nletters to her brother--though they came to Wabi only about twice a\r\nmonth, because only so often did the mail-carrier go out from the Post.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time in his lonely school life that Wabigoon became\r\nacquainted with Roderick Drew. Roderick, even as Wabi fancied himself to\r\nbe just at this time, was a child of misfortune. His father had died\r\nbefore he could remember, and the property he had left had dwindled\r\nslowly away during the passing of years. Rod was spending his last week\r\nin school when he met Wabigoon. Necessity had become his grim master,\r\nand the following week he was going to work. As the boy described the\r\nsituation to his Indian friend, his mother \"had fought to the last ditch\r\nto keep him in school, but now his time was up.\" Wabi seized upon the\r\nwhite youth as an oasis in a vast desert. After a little the two became\r\nalmost inseparable, and their friendship culminated in Wabi's going to\r\nlive in the Drew home. Mrs. Drew was a woman of education and\r\nrefinement, and her interest in Wabigoon was almost that of a mother. In\r\nthis environment the ragged edges were smoothed away from the Indian\r\nboy's deportment, and his letters to Minnetaki were more and more filled\r\nwith enthusiastic descriptions of his new friends. After a little Mrs.\r\nDrew received a grateful letter of thanks from the princess mother at\r\nWabinosh House, and thus a pleasant correspondence sprang up between the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThere were now few lonely hours for the two boys. During the long winter\r\nevenings, when Roderick was through with his day's work and Wabi had\r\ncompleted his studies, they would sit before the fire and the Indian\r\nyouth would describe the glorious life of the vast northern wilderness;\r\nand day by day, and week by week, there steadily developed within Rod's\r\nbreast a desire to see and live that life. A thousand plans were made, a\r\nthousand adventures pictured, and the mother would smile and laugh and\r\nplan with them.\r\n\r\nBut in time the end of it all came, and Wabi went back to the princess\r\nmother, to Minnetaki, and to his forests. There were tears in the boys'\r\neyes when they parted, and the mother cried for the Indian boy who was\r\nreturning to his people. Many of the days that followed were painful to\r\nRoderick Drew. Eight months had bred a new nature in him, and when Wabi\r\nleft it was as if a part of his own life had gone with him. Spring came\r\nand passed, and then summer. Every mail from Wabinosh House brought\r\nletters for the Drews, and never did an Indian courier drop a pack at\r\nthe Post that did not carry a bundle of letters for Wabigoon.\r\n\r\nThen in the early autumn, when September frosts were turning the leaves\r\nof the North to red and gold, there came the long letter from Wabi which\r\nbrought joy, excitement and misgiving into the little home of the mother\r\nand her son. It was accompanied by one from the factor himself, another\r\nfrom the princess mother, and by a tiny note from Minnetaki, who pleaded\r\nwith the others that Roderick and Mrs. Drew might spend the winter with\r\nthem at Wabinosh House.\r\n\r\n\"You need not fear about losing your position.\" wrote Wabigoon. \"We\r\nshall make more money up here this winter than you could earn in Detroit\r\nin three years. We will hunt wolves. The country is alive with them, and\r\nthe government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every scalp taken.\r\nTwo winters ago I killed forty and I did not make a business of it at\r\nthat. I have a tame wolf which we use as a decoy. Don't bother about a\r\ngun or anything like that. We have everything here.\"\r\n\r\nFor several days Mrs. Drew and her son deliberated upon the situation\r\nbefore a reply was sent to the Newsomes. Roderick pleaded, pictured the\r\nglorious times they would have, the health that it would give them, and\r\nmarshaled in a dozen different ways his arguments in favor of accepting\r\nthe invitation. On the other hand, his mother was filled with doubt.\r\nTheir finances were alarmingly low, and Rod would be giving up a sure\r\nthough small income, which was now supporting them comfortably. His\r\nfuture was bright, and that winter would see him promoted to ten dollars\r\na week in the mercantile house where he was employed. In the end they\r\ncame to an understanding. Mrs. Drew would not go to Wabinosh House, but\r\nshe would allow Roderick to spend the winter there--and word to this\r\neffect was sent off into the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later came Wabigoon's reply. On the tenth of October he\r\nwould meet Rod at Sprucewood, on the Black Sturgeon River. Thence they\r\nwould travel by canoe up the Sturgeon River to Sturgeon Lake, take\r\nportage to Lake Nipigon, and arrive at Wabinosh House before the ice of\r\nearly winter shut them in. There was little time to lose in making\r\npreparations, and the fourth day following the receipt of Wabi's letter\r\nfound Rod and his mother waiting for the train which was to whirl the\r\nboy into his new life. Not until the eleventh did he arrive at\r\nSprucewood. Wabi was there to meet him, accompanied by an Indian from\r\nthe Post; and that same afternoon the journey up Black Sturgeon River\r\nwas begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRODERICK SEES THE FOOTPRINT\r\n\r\n\r\nRod was now plunged for the first time in his life into the heart of the\r\nWilderness. Seated in the bow of the birch-bark canoe which was carrying\r\nthem up the Sturgeon, with Wabi close behind him, he drank in the wild\r\nbeauties of the forests and swamps through which they slipped almost as\r\nnoiselessly as shadows, his heart thumping in joyous excitement, his\r\neyes constantly on the alert for signs of the big game which Wabi told\r\nhim was on all sides of them. Across his knees, ready for instant use,\r\nwas Wabi's repeating rifle. The air was keen with the freshness left by\r\nnight frosts. At times deep masses of gold and crimson forests shut them\r\nin, at others, black forests of spruce came down to the river's edge;\r\nagain they would pass silently through great swamps of tamaracks. In\r\nthis vast desolation there was a mysterious quiet, except for the\r\noccasional sounds of wild life. Partridges drummed back in the woods,\r\nflocks of ducks got up with a great rush of wings at almost every turn,\r\nand once, late in the morning of the first day out, Rod was thrilled by\r\na crashing in the undergrowth scarcely a stone's throw from the canoe.\r\nHe could see saplings twisting and bending, and heard Wabi whisper\r\nbehind him:\r\n\r\n\"A moose!\"\r\n\r\nThey were words to set his hands trembling and his whole body quivering\r\nwith anticipation. There was in him now none of the old hunter's\r\ncoolness, none of the almost stoical indifference with which the men of\r\nthe big North hear these sounds of the wild things about them. Rod had\r\nyet to see his first big game.\r\n\r\nThat moment came in the afternoon. The canoe had skimmed lightly around\r\na bend in the river. Beyond this bend a mass of dead driftwood had\r\nwedged against the shore, and this driftwood, as the late sun sank\r\nbehind the forests, was bathed in a warm yellow glow. And basking in\r\nthis glow, as he loves to do at the approach of winter nights, was an\r\nanimal, the sight of which drew a sharp, excited cry from between Rod's\r\nlips. In an instant he had recognized it as a bear. The animal was taken\r\ncompletely by surprise and was less than half a dozen rods away. Quick\r\nas a flash, and hardly realizing what he was doing, the boy drew his\r\nrifle to his shoulder, took quick aim and fired. The bear was already\r\nclambering up the driftwood, but stopped suddenly at the report, slipped\r\nas if about to fall back--then continued his retreat.\r\n\r\n\"You hit 'im!\" shouted Wabi. \"Quick-try 'im again!\"\r\n\r\nRod's second shot seemed to have no effect In his excitement he jumped\r\nto his feet, forgetting that he was in a frail canoe, and took a last\r\nshot at the big black beast that was just about to disappear over the\r\nedge of the driftwood. Both Wabi and his Indian companion flung\r\nthemselves on the shore side of their birch and dug their paddles deep\r\ninto the water, but their efforts were unavailing to save their reckless\r\ncomrade. Unbalanced by the concussion of his gun, Rod plunged backward\r\ninto the river, but before he had time to sink, Wabi reached over and\r\ngrabbed him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make a move--and hang on to the gun!\" he warned. \"If we try to\r\nget you in here we'll all go over!\" He made a sign to the Indian, who\r\nswung the canoe slowly inshore. Then he grinned down into Rod's\r\ndripping, unhappy face.\r\n\r\n\"By George, that last shot was a dandy for a tenderfoot! You got your\r\nbear!\"\r\n\r\nDespite his uncomfortable position, Rod gave a whoop of joy, and no\r\nsooner did his feet touch solid bottom than he loosened himself from\r\nWabi's grip and plunged toward the driftwood. On its very top he found\r\nthe bear, as dead as a bullet through its side and another through its\r\nhead could make it. Standing there beside his first big game, dripping\r\nand shivering, he looked down upon the two who were pulling their canoe\r\nashore and gave, a series of triumphant whoops that could have been\r\nheard half a mile away.\r\n\r\n\"It's camp and a fire for you,\" laughed Wabi, hurrying up to him. \"This\r\nis better luck than I thought you'd have, Rod. We'll have a glorious\r\nfeast to-night, and a fire of this driftwood that will show you what\r\nmakes life worth the living up here in the North. Ho, Muky,\" he called\r\nto the old Indian, \"cut this fellow up, will you? I'll make camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we keep the skin?\" asked Rod. \"It's my first, you know, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we can. Give us a hand with the fire, Rod; it will keep you\r\nfrom catching cold.\"\r\n\r\nIn the excitement of making their first camp, Rod almost forgot that he\r\nwas soaked to the skin, and that night was falling about them. The first\r\nstep was the building of a fire, and soon a great, crackling, almost\r\nsmokeless blaze was throwing its light and heat for thirty feet around.\r\nWabi now brought blankets from the canoe, stripped off a part of his own\r\nclothes, made Rod undress, and soon had that youth swathed in dry togs,\r\nwhile his wet ones were hung close up to the fire. For the first time\r\nRod saw the making of a wilderness shelter. Whistling cheerily, Wabi got\r\nan ax from the canoe, went into the edge of the cedars and cut armful\r\nafter armful of saplings and boughs. Tying his blankets about himself,\r\nRod helped to carry these, a laughable and grotesque figure as he\r\nstumbled about clumsily in his efforts. Within half an hour the cedar\r\nshelter was taking form. Two crotched saplings were driven into the\r\nground eight feet apart, and from one to the other, resting in the\r\ncrotches, was placed another sapling, which formed the ridge-pole; and\r\nfrom this pole there ran slantwise to the earth half a dozen others,\r\nmaking a framework upon which the cedar boughs were piled. By the time\r\nthe old Indian had finished his bear the home was completed, and with\r\nits beds of sweet-smelling boughs, the great camp-fire in front and the\r\ndense wilderness about them growing black with the approach of night,\r\nRod thought that nothing in picture-book or story could quite equal the\r\nreality of that moment. And when, a few moments later, great bear-steaks\r\nwere broiling over a mass of coals, and the odor of coffee mingled with\r\nthat of meal-cakes sizzling on a heated stone, he knew that his dearest\r\ndreams had come true.\r\n\r\nThat night in the glow of the camp-fire Rod listened to the thrilling\r\nstories of Wabi and the old Indian, and lay awake until nearly dawn,\r\nlistening to the occasional howl of a wolf, mysterious splashings in the\r\nriver and the shrill notes of the night birds. There were varied\r\nexperiences in the following three days: one frosty morning before the\r\nothers were awake he stole out from the camp with Wabi's rifle and shot\r\ntwice at a red deer--which he missed both times; there was an exciting\r\nbut fruitless race with a swimming caribou in Sturgeon Lake, at which\r\nWabi himself took three long-range shots without effect.\r\n\r\nIt was on a glorious autumn afternoon that Wabi's keen eyes first\r\ndescried the log buildings of the Post snuggled in the edge of the\r\nseemingly unending forest. As they approached he joyfully pointed out\r\nthe different buildings to Rod--the Company store, the little cluster of\r\nemployees' homes and the factor's house, where Rod was to meet his\r\nwelcome. At least Roderick himself had thought it would be there. But as\r\nthey came nearer a single canoe shot out suddenly from the shore and the\r\nyoung hunters could see a white handkerchief waving them greeting. Wabi\r\nreplied with a whoop of pleasure and fired his gun into the air.\r\n\r\n\"It's Minnetaki!\" he cried. \"She said she would watch for us and come\r\nout to meet us!\"\r\n\r\nMinnetaki! A little nervous thrill shot through Rod. Wabi had described\r\nher to him a thousand times in those winter evenings at home; with a\r\nbrother's love and pride he had always brought her into their talks and\r\nplans, and somehow, little by little, Rod had grown to like her very\r\nmuch without ever having seen her.\r\n\r\nThe two canoes swiftly approached each other, and in a few minutes more\r\nwere alongside. With a glad laughing cry Minnetaki leaned over and\r\nkissed her brother, while at the same time her dark eyes shot a curious\r\nglance at the youth of whom she had read and heard so much.\r\n\r\nAt this time Minnetaki was fifteen. Like her mother's race she was\r\nslender, of almost woman's height, and unconsciously as graceful as a\r\nfawn in her movements. A slightly waving wealth of raven hair framed\r\nwhat Rod thought to be one of the prettiest faces he had ever seen, and\r\nentwined in the heavy silken braid that fell over her shoulder were a\r\nnumber of red autumn leaves. As she straightened herself in her canoe\r\nshe looked at Rod and smiled, and he in making a polite effort to lift\r\nhis cap in civilized style, lost that article of apparel in a sudden\r\ngust of wind. In an instant there was a general laugh of merriment in\r\nwhich even the old Indian joined. The little incident did more toward\r\nmaking comradeship than anything else that might have happened, and\r\nlaughing again into Rod's face Minnetaki urged her canoe toward the\r\nfloating cap.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't wear such things until it gets cold,\" she said, after\r\nretrieving the cap and handing it to him. \"Wabi does--but I don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I won't,\" replied Rod gallantly, and at Wabi's burst of laughter\r\nboth blushed.\r\n\r\nThat first night at the Post Rod found that Wabi had already made all\r\nplans for the winter's hunting, and the white youth's complete equipment\r\nwas awaiting him in the room assigned to him in the factor's house--a\r\ndeadly looking five-shot Remington, similar to Wabi's, a long-barreled,\r\nheavy-caliber revolver, snow-shoes, and a dozen other articles necessary\r\nto one about to set out upon a long expedition in the wilderness. Wabi\r\nhad also mapped out their hunting-grounds. Wolves in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of the Post, where they were being constantly sought by the\r\nIndians and the factor's men, had become exceedingly cautious and were\r\nnot numerous, but in the almost untraveled wilderness a hundred miles to\r\nthe north and east they were literally overrunning the country, killing\r\nmoose, caribou and deer in great numbers.\r\n\r\nIn this region Wabi planned to make their winter quarters. And no time\r\nwas to be lost in taking up the trail, for the log house in which they\r\nwould pass the bitterly cold months should be built before the heavy\r\nsnows set in. It was therefore decided that the young hunters should\r\nstart within a week, accompanied by Mukoki, the old Indian, a cousin of\r\nthe slain Wabigoon, whom Wabi had given the nickname of Muky and who had\r\nbeen a faithful comrade to him from his earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nRod made the most of the six days which were allotted to him at the\r\nPost, and while Wabi helped to handle the affairs of the Company's store\r\nduring a short absence of his father at Port Arthur, the lovely little\r\nMinnetaki gave our hero his first lessons in woodcraft. In canoe, with\r\nthe rifle, and in reading the signs of forest life Wabi's sister\r\nawakened constantly increasing admiration in Rod. To see her bending\r\nover some freshly made trail, her cheeks flushed, her eyes sparkling\r\nwith excitement, her rich hair filled with the warmth of the sun, was a\r\npicture to arouse enthusiasm even in the heart of a youngster of\r\neighteen, and a hundred times the boy mentally vowed that \"she was a\r\nbrick\" from the tips of her pretty moccasined feet to the top of her\r\nprettier head. Half a dozen times at least he voiced this sentiment to\r\nWabi, and Wabi agreed with great enthusiasm. In fact, by the time the\r\nweek was almost gone Minnetaki and Rod had become great chums, and it\r\nwas not without some feeling of regret that the young wolf hunter\r\ngreeted the dawn of the day that was to see them begin their journey\r\ndeeper into the wilds.\r\n\r\nMinnetaki was one of the earliest risers at the Post. Rod was seldom\r\nbehind her. But on this particular morning he was late and heard the\r\ngirl whistling outside half an hour before he was dressed--for Minnetaki\r\ncould whistle in a manner that often filled him with envy. By the time\r\nhe came down she had disappeared in the edge of the forest, and Wabi,\r\nwho was also ahead of him, was busy with Mukoki tying up their equipment\r\nin packs. It was a glorious morning, clear and frosty, and Rod noticed\r\nthat a thin shell of ice had formed on the lake during the night. Once\r\nor twice Wabi turned toward the forest and gave his signal whoop, but\r\nreceived no reply.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why Minnetaki doesn't come back,\" he remarked carelessly,\r\nas he fastened a shoulder-strap about a bundle. \"Breakfast will be ready\r\nin a jiffy. Hunt her up, will you, Rod?\"\r\n\r\nNothing loath, Rod started out on a brisk run along the path which he\r\nknew to be a favorite with Minnetaki and shortly it brought him down to\r\na pebbly stretch of the beach where she frequently left her canoe. That\r\nshe had been here a few minutes before he could tell by the fact that\r\nthe ice about the birch-bark was broken, as though the girl had tested\r\nits thickness by shoving the light craft out into it for a few feet. Her\r\nfootsteps led plainly up the shelving shore and into the forest.\r\n\r\n\"O Minnetaki--Minnetaki!\"\r\n\r\nRod called loudly and listened. There was no response. As if impelled by\r\nsome presentiment which he himself could not explain, the boy hurried\r\ndeeper into the forest along the narrow path which Minnetaki must have\r\ntaken. Five minutes--ten minutes--and he called again. Still there was\r\nno answer. Possibly the girl had not gone so far, or she might have left\r\nthe path for the thick woods. A little farther on there was a soft spot\r\nin the path where a great tree-trunk had rotted half a century before,\r\nleaving a rich black soil. Clearly traced in this were the imprints of\r\nMinnetaki's moccasins. For a full minute Rod stopped and listened,\r\nmaking not a sound. Why he maintained silence he could not have\r\nexplained. But he knew that he was half a mile from the Post, and that\r\nWabi's sister should not be here at breakfast time. In this minute's\r\nquiet he unconsciously studied the tracks in the ground. How small the\r\npretty Indian maiden's feet were! And he noticed, too, that her\r\nmoccasins, unlike most moccasins, had a slight heel.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment more his inspection was cut short. Was that a cry he\r\nheard far ahead? His heart seemed to stop beating, his blood\r\nthrilled--and in another instant he was running down the path like a\r\ndeer. Twenty rods beyond this point the path entered an opening in the\r\nforest made by a great fire, and half-way across this opening the youth\r\nsaw a sight which chilled him to the marrow. There was Minnetaki, her\r\nlong hair tumbling loosely down her back, a cloth tied around her\r\nhead--and on either side an Indian dragging her swiftly toward the\r\nopposite forest!\r\n\r\nFor as long as he might have drawn three breaths Rod stood transfixed\r\nwith horror. Then his senses returned to him, and every muscle in his\r\nbody seemed to bound with action. For days he had been practising with\r\nhis revolver and it was now in the holster at his side. Should he use\r\nit? Or might he hit Minnetaki? At his feet he saw a club and snatching\r\nthis up he sped across the opening, the soft earth holding the sound of\r\nhis steps. When he was a dozen feet behind the Indians Minnetaki\r\nstumbled in a sudden effort to free herself, and as one of her captors\r\nhalf turned to drag her to her feet he saw the enraged youth, club\r\nuplifted, bearing down upon them like a demon. A terrific yell from Rod,\r\na warning cry from the Indian, and the fray began. With crushing force,\r\nthe boy's club fell upon the shoulder of the second Indian, and before\r\nhe could recover from the delivery of this blow the youth was caught in\r\na choking, deadly grip by the other from behind.\r\n\r\nFreed by the sudden attack, Minnetaki tore away the cloth that bound her\r\neyes and mouth. As quick as a flash she took in the situation. At her\r\nfeet the wounded Indian was half rising, and upon the ground near him,\r\nstruggling in close embrace, were Rod and the other. She saw the\r\nIndian's fatal grip upon her preserver's throat, the whitening face and\r\nwide-open eyes, and with a great, sobbing cry she caught up the fallen\r\nclub and brought it down with all her strength upon the redskin's head.\r\nTwice, three times the club rose and fell, and the grip on Rod's throat\r\nrelaxed. A fourth time it rose, but this time was caught from behind,\r\nand a huge hand clutched the brave girl's throat so that the cry on her\r\nlips died in a gasp. But the relief gave Rod his opportunity. With a\r\ntremendous effort he reached his pistol holster, drew out the gun, and\r\npressed it close up against his assailant's body. There was a muffled\r\nreport and with a shriek of agony the Indian pitched backward. Hearing\r\nthe shot and seeing the effect upon his comrade, the second Indian\r\nreleased his hold on Minnetaki and ran for the forest. Rod, seeing\r\nMinnetaki fall in a sobbing, frightened heap, forgot all else but to run\r\nto her, smooth back her hair and comfort her with all of the assurances\r\nat his boyish command.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Wabi and the old Indian guide found them five minutes\r\nlater. Hearing Rod's first piercing yell of attack, they had raced into\r\nthe forest, afterward guided by the two or three shrill screams which\r\nMinnetaki had unconsciously emitted during the struggle. Close behind\r\nthem, smelling trouble, followed two of the Post employees.\r\n\r\nThe attempted abduction of Wabi's sister, Rod's heroic rescue and the\r\ndeath of one of the captors, who was recognized as one of Woonga's men,\r\ncaused a seven-day sensation at the Post.\r\n\r\nThere was now no thought of leaving on the part of the young wolf\r\nhunters. It was evident that Woonga was again in the neighborhood, and\r\nWabi and Rod, together with a score of Indians and hunters, spent days\r\nin scouring the forests and swamps. But the Woongas disappeared as\r\nsuddenly as they came. Not until Wabi had secured a promise from\r\nMinnetaki that she would no longer go into the forests unaccompanied did\r\nthe Indian youth again allow himself to take up their interrupted plans.\r\n\r\nMinnetaki had been within easy calling distance of help when the\r\nWoongas, without warning, sprang upon her, smothered her attempted cries\r\nand dragged her away, compelling her to walk alone over the soft earth\r\nwhere Rod had seen her footsteps, so that any person who followed might\r\nsuppose she was alone and safe. This fact stirred the dozen white\r\nfamilies at the Post into aggressive action, and four of the most\r\nskillful Indian track-hunters in the service were detailed to devote\r\nthemselves exclusively to hunting down the outlaws, their operations not\r\nto include a territory extending more than twenty miles from Wabinosh\r\nHouse in any direction. With these precautions it was believed that no\r\nharm could come to Minnetaki or other young girls of the Post.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, on a Monday, the fourth day of November, that Rod,\r\nWabi and Mukoki turned their faces at last to the adventures that\r\nawaited them in the great North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRODERICK'S FIRST TASTE OF THE HUNTER'S LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time it was bitter cold. The lakes and rivers were frozen deep\r\nand a light snow covered the ground. Already two weeks behind their\r\nplans, the young wolf hunters and the old Indian made forced marches\r\naround the northern extremity of Lake Nipigon and on the sixth day found\r\nthemselves on the Ombabika River, where they were compelled to stop on\r\naccount of a dense snow-storm. A temporary camp was made, and it was\r\nwhile constructing this camp that Mukoki discovered signs of wolves. It\r\nwas therefore decided to remain for a day or two and investigate the\r\nhunting-grounds. On the morning of the second day Wabi shot at and\r\nwounded the old bull moose which met such a tragic end a few hours\r\nlater, and that same morning the two boys made a long tour to the north\r\nin the hope of finding that they were in a good game country, which\r\nwould mean also that there were plenty of wolves.\r\n\r\nThis left Mukoki alone in camp. Thus far, in their desire to cover as\r\nmuch ground as possible before the heavy snows came, Wabi and his\r\ncompanions had not stopped to hunt for game and for six days their only\r\nmeat had been bacon and jerked venison. Mukoki, whose prodigious\r\nappetite was second only to the shrewdness with which he stalked game to\r\nsatisfy it, determined to add to their larder if possible during the\r\nothers' absence, and with this object in view he left camp late in the\r\nafternoon to be gone, as he anticipated, not longer than an hour or so.\r\n\r\nWith him he carried two powerful wolf-traps slung over his shoulders.\r\nStealing cautiously along the edge of the river, his eyes and ears alert\r\nfor game, Mukoki suddenly came upon the frozen and half-eaten carcass of\r\na red deer. It was evident that the animal had been killed by wolves\r\neither the day or night before, and from the tracks in the snow the\r\nIndian concluded that not more than four wolves had participated in the\r\nslaughter and feast. That these wolves would return to continue their\r\nbanquet, probably that night, Mukoki's many experiences as a wolf hunter\r\nassured him; and he paused long enough to set his traps, afterward\r\ncovering them over with three or four inches of snow.\r\n\r\nContinuing his hunt, the old Indian soon struck the fresh spoor of a\r\ndeer. Believing that the animal would not travel for any great distance\r\nin the deep snow, he swiftly took up the trail. Half a mile farther on\r\nhe stopped abruptly with a grunt of unbounded surprise. Another hunter\r\nhad taken up the trail!\r\n\r\nWith increased caution Mukoki now advanced. Two hundred feet more and a\r\nsecond pair of moccasined feet joined in the pursuit, and a little later\r\nstill a third!\r\n\r\nLed on by curiosity more than by the hope of securing a partnership\r\nshare in the quarry, the Indian slipped silently and swiftly through the\r\nforest. As he emerged from a dense growth of spruce through which the\r\ntracks led him Mukoki was treated to another surprise by almost\r\nstumbling over the carcass of the deer he had been following. A brief\r\nexamination satisfied him that the doe had been shot at least two hours\r\nbefore. The three hunters had cut out her heart, liver and tongue and\r\nhad also taken the hind quarters, leaving the remainder of the carcass\r\nand the skin! Why had they neglected this most valuable part of their\r\nspoils? With a new gleam of interest in his eyes Mukoki carefully\r\nscrutinized the moccasin trails. He soon discovered that the Indians\r\nahead of him were in great haste, and that after cutting the choicest\r\nmeat from the doe they had started off to make up for lost time by\r\nrunning!\r\n\r\nWith another grunt of astonishment the old Indian returned to the\r\ncarcass, quickly stripped off the skin, wrapped in it the fore quarters\r\nand ribs of the doe, and thus loaded, took up the home trail. It was\r\ndark when he reached camp. Wabi and Rod had not yet returned. Building a\r\nhuge fire and hanging the ribs of the doe on a spit before it, he\r\nanxiously awaited their appearance.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later he heard the shout which brought him quickly to where\r\nWabi was holding the partly unconscious form of Rod in his arms.\r\n\r\nIt took but a few moments to carry the injured youth to camp, and not\r\nuntil Rod was resting upon a pile of blankets in their shack, with the\r\nwarmth of the fire reviving him, did Wabi vouchsafe an explanation to\r\nthe old Indian.\r\n\r\n\"I guess he's got a broken arm, Muky,\" he said. \"Have you any hot\r\nwater?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shot?\" asked the old hunter, paying no attention to the question. He\r\ndropped upon his knees beside Rod, his long brown fingers reaching out\r\nanxiously. \"Shot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--hit with a club. We met three Indian hunters who were in camp and\r\nwho invited us to eat with them. While we were eating they jumped upon\r\nour backs. Rod got that--and lost his rifle!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki quickly stripped the wounded boy of his garments, baring his left\r\narm and side. The arm was swollen and almost black and there was a great\r\nbruise on Rod's body a little above the waist. Mukoki was a surgeon by\r\nnecessity, a physician such as one finds only in the vast unblazed\r\nwildernesses, where Nature is the teacher. Crudely he made his\r\nexamination, pinching and twisting the flesh and bones until Rod cried\r\nout in pain, but in the end there was a glad triumph in his voice as he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"No bone broke--hurt most here!\" and he touched the bruise. \"Near broke\r\nrib--not quite. Took wind out and made great deal sick. Want good\r\nsupper, hot coffee--rub in bear's grease, then be better!\"\r\n\r\nRod, who had opened his eyes, smiled faintly and Wabi gave a half-shout\r\nof delight.\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad as we thought, eh, Rod?\" he cried. \"You can't fool Muky! If\r\nhe says your arm isn't broken--why, it _isn't_, and that's all there is\r\nto it. Let me bolster you up in these blankets and we'll soon have a\r\nsupper that will sizzle the aches out of you. I smell meat--fresh meat!\"\r\n\r\nWith a chuckle of pleasure Mukoki jumped to his feet and ran out to\r\nwhere the ribs of the doe were slowly broiling over the fire. They were\r\nalready done to a rich brown and their dripping juice filled the\r\nnostrils with an appetizing odor. By the time Wabi had applied Mukoki's\r\nprescription to his comrade's wounds, and had done them up in bandages,\r\nthe tempting feast was spread before them.\r\n\r\nAs a liberal section of the ribs was placed before him, together with\r\ncorn-meal cakes and a cup of steaming coffee, Rod could not suppress a\r\nhappy though somewhat embarrassed laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ashamed of myself, Wabi,\" he said. \"Here I've been causing so much\r\nbother, like some helpless kid; and now I find I haven't even the excuse\r\nof a broken arm, and that I'm as hungry as a bear! Looks pretty yellow,\r\ndoesn't it? Just as though I was scared to death! So help me, I almost\r\nwish my arm _was_ broken!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki had buried his teeth in a huge chunk of fat rib, but he lowered\r\nit with a great chuckling grunt, half of his face smeared with the first\r\nresults of his feast.\r\n\r\n\"Whole lot sick,\" he explained. \"Be sick some more--mighty sick! Maybe\r\nvomit lots!\"\r\n\r\n\"Waugh!\" shrieked Wabi. \"How is that for cheerful news, Rod?\" His\r\nmerriment echoed far out into the night. Suddenly he caught himself and\r\npeered suspiciously into the gloom beyond the circle of firelight.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose they would follow?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nA more cautious silence followed, and the Indian youth quickly related\r\nthe adventures of the day to Mukoki--how, in the heart of the forest\r\nseveral miles beyond the lake, they had come upon the Indian hunters,\r\nhad accepted of their seemingly honest hospitality, and in the midst of\r\ntheir meal had suffered an attack from them. So sudden and unexpected\r\nhad been the assault that one of the Indians got away with Rod's rifle,\r\nammunition belt and revolver before any effort could be made to stop\r\nhim. Wabi was under the other two Indians when Rod came to his\r\nassistance, with the result that the latter was struck two heavy blows,\r\neither with a club or a gun-stock. So tenaciously had the Indian boy\r\nclung to his own weapon that his assailants, after a brief struggle,\r\ndarted into the dense underbrush, evidently satisfied with the white\r\nboy's equipment.\r\n\r\n\"They were of Woonga's people, without a doubt,\" finished Wabi. \"It\r\npuzzles me why they didn't kill us. They had half a dozen chances to\r\nshoot us, but didn't seem to want to do us any great injury. Either the\r\nmeasures taken at the Post are making them reform, or--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, a troubled look in his eyes. Immediately Mukoki told of his\r\nown experience and of the mysterious haste of the three Indians who had\r\nslain the doe.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly curious,\" rejoined the young Indian. \"They couldn't\r\nhave been the ones we met, but I'll wager they belong to the same gang.\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if we had hit upon one of Woonga's retreats.\r\nWe've always thought he was in the Thunder Bay regions to the west, and\r\nthat is where father is watching for him now. We've hit the hornets'\r\nnest, Muky, and the only thing for us to do is to get out of this\r\ncountry as fast as we can!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd make a nice pot-shot just at this moment,\" volunteered Rod,\r\nlooking across to the dense blackness on the opposite side of the river,\r\nwhere the moonlight seemed to make even more impenetrable the wall of\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there came a slight sound from behind him, the commotion of\r\na body moving softly beyond the wall of spruce boughs, then a curious,\r\nsuspicious sniffing, and after that a low whine.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\"\r\n\r\nWabi's command came in a tense whisper. He leaned close against the\r\nboughs, stealthily parted them, and slowly thrust his head through the\r\naperture.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Wolf!\" he whispered. \"What's up?\"\r\n\r\nAn arm's length away, tied before a smaller shelter of spruce, a gaunt,\r\ndog-like animal stood in a rigid listening attitude. An instant's\r\nglance, however, would have assured one that it was not a dog, but a\r\nfull-grown wolf. From the days of its puppyhood Wabi had taught it in\r\nthe ways of dogdom, yet had the animal perversely clung to its wild\r\ninstincts. A weakness in that thong, a slip of the collar, and Wolf\r\nwould have bounded joyously into the forests to seek for ever the packs\r\nof his fathers. Now the babeesh rope was taut, Wolf's muzzle was turned\r\nhalf to the sky, his ears were alert, half-sounding notes rattled in his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\"There is something near our camp!\" announced the Indian boy, drawing\r\nhimself back quickly. \"Muky--\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a long mournful howl from the captive wolf.\r\n\r\nMukoki had jumped to his feet with the alertness of a cat, and now with\r\nhis gun in his hand slunk around the edge of the shelter and buried\r\nhimself in the gloom. Roderick lay quiet while Wabi, seizing the\r\nremaining rifle, followed him.\r\n\r\n\"Lie over there in the dark, Rod, where the firelight doesn't show you\r\nup,\" he cautioned in a low voice. \"Probably it is only some animal that\r\nhas stumbled on to our camp, but we want to make sure.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the young hunter returned alone.\r\n\r\n\"False alarm!\" he laughed cheerfully. \"There's a part of a carcass of a\r\nred deer up the creek a bit. It has been killed by wolves, and Wolf\r\nsmells some of his own blood coming in to the feast. Muky has set traps\r\nthere and we may have our first scalp in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Mukoki?\"\r\n\r\n\"On watch. He is going to keep guard until a little after midnight, and\r\nthen I'll turn out. We can't be too careful, with the Woongas in the\r\nneighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nRod shifted himself uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do--to-morrow?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\" replied Wabi with emphasis. \"That is, if you are able to\r\ntravel. From what Mukoki tells me, and from what you and I already know,\r\nWoonga's people must be in the forests beyond the lake. We'll cut a\r\ntrail up the Ombabika for two or three days before we strike camp. You\r\nand Muky can start out as soon as it is light enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you--\" began Rod.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm going to take a run back over our old wolf-trail and collect\r\nthe scalps we shot to-day. There's a month's salary back there for you,\r\nRod! Now, let's turn in. Good night--sleep tight--and be sure to wake up\r\nearly in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys, exhausted by the adventures of the day, were soon in profound\r\nslumber. And though midnight came, and hour after hour passed between\r\nthen and dawn, the faithful Mukoki did not awaken them. Never for a\r\nmoment neglecting his caution the old Indian watched tirelessly over the\r\ncamp. With the first appearance of day he urged the fire into a roaring\r\nblaze, raked out a great mass of glowing coals, and proceeded to get\r\nbreakfast. Wabi discovered him at this task when he awoke from his\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think you would play this trick on me, Muky,\" he said, a flush\r\nof embarrassment gathering in his brown face. \"It's awfully good of you,\r\nand all that, but I wish you wouldn't treat me as if I were a child any\r\nlonger, old friend!\"\r\n\r\nHe placed his hand affectionately upon the kneeling Mukoki's shoulder,\r\nand the old hunter looked up at him with a happy, satisfied grin on his\r\nweather-beaten visage, wrinkled and of the texture of leather by nearly\r\nfifty years of life in the wilderness. It was Mukoki who had first\r\ncarried the baby Wabi about the woods upon his shoulders; it was he who\r\nhad played with him, cared for him, and taught him in the ways of the\r\nwild in early childhood, and it was he who had missed him most, with\r\nlittle Minnetaki, when he went away to school. All the love in the grim\r\nold redskin's heart was for the Indian youth and his sister, and to them\r\nMukoki was a second father, a silent, watchful guardian and comrade.\r\nThis one loving touch of Wabi's hand was ample reward for the long\r\nnight's duty, and his pleasure expressed itself in two or three low\r\nchuckling grunts.\r\n\r\n\"Had heap bad day,\" he replied. \"Very much tired. Me feel good--better\r\nthan sleep!\" He rose to his feet and handed Wabi the long fork with\r\nwhich he manipulated the meat on the spits. \"You can tend to that,\" he\r\nadded. \"I go see traps.\"\r\n\r\nRod, who had awakened and overheard these last remarks, called out from\r\nthe shack:\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Mukoki. I'm going with you. If you've got a wolf, I want\r\nto see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got one sure 'nuff,\" grinned the old Indian.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Rod came out, fully dressed and with a much healthier\r\ncolor in his face than when he went to bed the preceding night. He stood\r\nbefore the fire, stretched one arm then the other, gave a slight grimace\r\nof pain, and informed his anxious comrades that he seemed to be as well\r\nas ever, except that his arm and side were very sore.\r\n\r\nWalking slowly, that Rod might \"find himself,\" as Wabi expressed it, the\r\ntwo went up the river. It was a dull gray morning and occasionally large\r\nflakes of snow fell, giving evidence that before the day was far\r\nadvanced another storm would set in. Mukoki's traps were not more than\r\nan eighth of a mile from camp, and as the two rounded a certain bend in\r\nthe river the old hunter suddenly stopped with a huge grant of\r\nsatisfaction. Following the direction in which he pointed Rod saw a dark\r\nobject lying in the snow a short distance away.\r\n\r\n\"That's heem!\" exclaimed the Indian.\r\n\r\nAs they approached, the object became animate, pulling and tearing in\r\nthe snow as though in the agonies of death. A few moments more and they\r\nwere close up to the captive.\r\n\r\n\"She wolf!\" explained Mukoki.\r\n\r\nHe gripped the ax he had brought with him and approached within a few\r\nfeet of the crouching animal. Rod could see that one of the big steel\r\ntraps had caught the wolf on the forward leg and that the other had\r\nburied its teeth in one of the hind legs. Thus held the doomed animal\r\ncould make little effort to protect itself and crouched in sullen quiet,\r\nits white fangs gleaming in a noiseless, defiant snarl, its eyes shining\r\nwith pain and anger, and with only its thin starved body, which jerked\r\nand trembled as the Indian came nearer, betraying signs of fear. To Rod\r\nit might have been a pitiful sight had not there come to him a thought\r\nof the preceding night and of his own and Wabi's narrow escape from the\r\npack.\r\n\r\nTwo or three quick blows of the ax and the wolf was dead. With a skill\r\nwhich can only be found among those of his own race, Mukoki drew his\r\nknife, cut deftly around the wolf's head just below the ears, and with\r\none downward, one upward, and two sidewise jerks tore off the scalp.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, without giving a thought to his speech, there shot from Rod,\r\n\r\n\"Is that the way you scalp people?\"\r\n\r\nMukoki looked up, his jaw fell--and then he gave the nearest thing to a\r\nreal laugh that Rod ever heard come from between his lips. When Mukoki\r\nlaughed it was usually in a half-chuckle, a half-gurgle--something that\r\nneither Rod nor Wabi could have imitated if they had tried steadily for\r\na month.\r\n\r\n\"Never scalped white people,\" the old Indian shot back. \"Father did\r\nwhen--young man. Did great scalp business!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki had not done chuckling to himself even when they reached camp.\r\n\r\nScarcely ten minutes were taken in eating breakfast. Snow was already\r\nbeginning to fall, and if the hunters took up their trail at once their\r\ntracks would undoubtedly be entirely obliterated by midday, which was\r\nthe best possible thing that could happen for them in the Woonga\r\ncountry. On the other hand, Wabi was anxious to follow back over the\r\nwolf-trail before the snow shut it in. There was no danger of their\r\nbecoming separated and lost, for it was agreed that Rod and Mukoki\r\nshould travel straight up the frozen river. Wabi would overtake them\r\nbefore nightfall.\r\n\r\nArming himself with his rifle, revolver, knife, and a keen-edged\r\nbelt-ax, the Indian boy lost no time in leaving camp. A quarter of an\r\nhour later Wabi came out cautiously on the end of the lake where had\r\noccurred the unequal duel between the old bull moose and the wolves. A\r\nsingle glance told him what the outcome of that duel had been. Twenty\r\nrods out upon the snow he saw parts of a great skeleton, and a huge pair\r\nof antlers.\r\n\r\nAs he stood on the arena of the mighty battle, Wabi would have given a\r\ngreat deal if Rod could have been with him. There lay the heroic old\r\nmoose, now nothing more than a skeleton. But the magnificent head and\r\nhorns still remained--the largest head that the Indian youth, in all his\r\nwilderness life, had ever seen--and it occurred to him that if this head\r\ncould be preserved and taken back to civilization it would be worth a\r\nhundred dollars or more. That the old bull had put up a magnificent\r\nfight was easily discernible. Fifty feet away were the bones of a wolf,\r\nand almost under the skeleton of the moose were those of another. The\r\nheads of both still remained, and Wabi, after taking their scalps,\r\nhurried on over the trail.\r\n\r\nHalf-way across the lake, where he had taken his last two shots, were\r\nthe skeletons of two more wolves, and in the edge of the spruce forest\r\nhe found another. This animal had evidently been wounded farther back\r\nand had later been set upon by some of the pack and killed. Half a mile\r\ndeeper in the forest he came upon a spot where he had emptied five\r\nshells into the pack and here he found the bones of two more wolves. He\r\nhad seven scalps in his possession when he turned back over the home\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nBeside the remains of the old bull Wabi paused again. He knew that the\r\nIndians frequently preserved moose and caribou heads through the winter\r\nby keeping them frozen, and the head at his feet was a prize worth some\r\nthought. But how could he keep it preserved until their return, months\r\nlater? He could not suspend it from the limb of a tree, as was the\r\ncustom when in camp, for it would either be stolen by some passing\r\nhunter or spoiled by the first warm days of spring. Suddenly an idea\r\ncame to him. Why could it not be preserved in what white hunters called\r\nan \"Indian ice-box\"? In an instant he was acting upon this inspiration.\r\nIt was not a small task to drag the huge head to the shelter of the\r\ntamaracks, where, safely hidden from view, he made a closer examination.\r\nThe head was gnawed considerably by the wolves, but Wabi had seen worse\r\nones skillfully repaired by the Indians at the Post.\r\n\r\nUnder a dense growth of spruce, where the rays of the sun seldom\r\npenetrated, the Indian boy set to work with his belt-ax. For an hour and\r\na half he worked steadily, and at the end of that time had dug a hole in\r\nthe frozen earth three feet deep and four feet square. This hole he now\r\nlined with about two inches of snow, packed as tight as he could jam it\r\nwith the butt of his gun. Then placing in the head he packed snow\r\nclosely about it and afterward filled in the earth, stamping upon the\r\nhard chunks with his feet. When all was done he concealed the signs of\r\nhis work under a covering of snow, blazed two trees with his ax, and\r\nresumed his journey.\r\n\r\n\"There is thirty dollars for each of us if there's a cent,\" he mused\r\nsoftly, as he hurried toward the Ombabika. \"That ground won't thaw out\r\nuntil June. A moose-head and eight scalps at fifteen dollars each isn't\r\nbad for one day's work, Rod, old boy!\"\r\n\r\nHe had been absent for three hours. It had been snowing steadily and by\r\nthe time he reached their old camp the trail left by Rod and Mukoki was\r\nalready partly obliterated, showing that they had secured an early start\r\nup the river.\r\n\r\nBowing his head in the white clouds falling silently about him, Wabi\r\nstarted in swift pursuit. He could not see ten rods ahead of him, so\r\ndense was the storm, and at times one side or the other of the river was\r\nlost to view. Conditions could not have been better for their flight out\r\nof the Woonga country, thought the young hunter. By nightfall they would\r\nbe many miles up the river, and no sign would be left behind to reveal\r\ntheir former presence or to show in which direction they had gone. For\r\ntwo hours he followed tirelessly over the trail, which became more and\r\nmore distinct as he proceeded, showing that he was rapidly gaining on\r\nhis comrades. But even now, though the trail was fresher and deeper, so\r\ndisguised had it become by falling snow that a passing hunter might have\r\nthought a moose or caribou had passed that way.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third hour, by which time he figured that he had made\r\nat least ten miles, Wabi sat down to rest, and to refresh himself with\r\nthe lunch which he had taken from the camp that morning. He was\r\nsurprised at Rod's endurance. That Mukoki and the white boy were still\r\nthree or four miles ahead of him he did not doubt, unless they, too, had\r\nstopped for dinner. This, on further thought, he believed was highly\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nThe wilderness about him was intensely still. Not even the twitter of a\r\nsnow-bird marred its silence. For a long time Wabi sat as immovable as\r\nthe log upon which he had seated himself, resting and listening. Such a\r\nday as this held a peculiar and unusual fascination for him. It was as\r\nif the whole world was shut out, and that even the wild things of the\r\nforest dared not go abroad in this supreme moment of Nature's handiwork,\r\nwhen with lavish hand she spread the white mantle that was to stretch\r\nfrom the border to Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nAs he listened there came to him suddenly a sound that forced from\r\nbetween his lips a half-articulate cry. It was the clear, ringing report\r\nof a rifle! And following it there came another, and another, until in\r\nquick succession he had counted five!\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean? He sprang to his feet, his heart thumping, every nerve\r\nin him prepared for action. He would have sworn it was Mukoki's\r\nrifle--yet Mukoki would not have fired at game! They had agreed upon\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHad Rod and the old Indian been attacked? In another instant Wabi was\r\nbounding over the trail with the speed of a deer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMYSTERIOUS SHOTS IN THE WILDERNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Indian youth sped over the trail in the direction of the\r\nrifle-shots he flung his usual caution to the winds. His blood thrilled\r\nwith the knowledge that there was not a moment to lose--that even now,\r\nin all probability, he would be too late to assist his friends. This\r\nfear was emphasized by the absolute silence which followed the five\r\nshots. Eagerly, almost prayerfully, he listened as he ran for other\r\nsounds of battle--for the report of Mukoki's revolver, or the whoops of\r\nthe victors. If there had been an ambush it was all over now. Each\r\nmoment added to his conviction, and as he thrust the muzzle of his gun\r\nahead of him, his finger hovering near the trigger and his snow-blinded\r\neyes staring ahead into the storm, something like a sob escaped his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nAhead of him the stream narrowed until it almost buried itself under a\r\nmass of towering cedars. The closeness of the forest walls now added to\r\nthe general gloom, intensified by the first gray pallor of the Northern\r\ndusk, which begins to fall in these regions early in the afternoon of\r\nNovember days. For a moment, just before plunging into the gloomy trail\r\nbetween the cedars, Wabi stopped and listened. He heard nothing but the\r\nbeating of his own heart, which worked like a trip-hammer within his\r\nbreast. The stillness was oppressive. And the longer he listened the\r\nmore some invisible power seemed to hold him back. It was not fear, it\r\nwas not lack of courage, but--\r\n\r\nWhat was there just beyond those cedars, lurking cautiously in the snow\r\ngloom?\r\n\r\nWith instinct that was almost animal in its unreasonableness Wabi sank\r\nupon his knees. He had seen nothing, he had heard nothing; but he\r\ncrouched close, until he was no larger than a waiting wolf, and there\r\nwas a deadly earnestness in the manner in which he turned his rifle into\r\nthe deeper gloom of those close-knit walls of forest. Something was\r\napproaching, cautiously, stealthily, and with extreme slowness. The\r\nIndian boy felt that this was so, and yet if his life had depended upon\r\nit he could not have told why. He huddled himself lower in the snow. His\r\neyes gleamed with excitement. Minute after minute passed, and still\r\nthere came no sound. Then, from far up that dusky avenue of cedars,\r\nthere came the sudden startled chatter of a moose-bird. It was a warning\r\nwhich years of experience had taught Wabi always to respect. Perhaps a\r\nroving fox had frightened it, perhaps the bird had taken to noisy flight\r\nat the near tread of a moose, a caribou, or a deer. But--\r\n\r\nTo Wabi the soft, quick notes of the moose-bird spelled man! In an\r\ninstant he was upon his feet, darting quickly into the sheltering cedars\r\nof the shore. Through these he now made his way with extreme caution,\r\nkeeping close to the bank of the frozen stream. After a little he paused\r\nagain and concealed himself behind the end of a fallen log. Ahead of him\r\nhe could look into the snow gloom between the cedars, and whatever was\r\ncoming through that gloom would have to pass within a dozen yards of\r\nhim. Each moment added to his excitement. He heard the chatter of a red\r\nsquirrel, much nearer than the moose-bird. Once he fancied that he heard\r\nthe striking of two objects, as though a rifle barrel had accidentally\r\ncome into contact with the dead limb of a tree.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Indian youth imagined that he saw something--an indistinct\r\nshadow that came in the snow gloom, then disappeared, and came again. He\r\nbrushed the water and snow from his eyes with one of his mittened hands\r\nand stared hard and steadily. Once more the shadow disappeared, then\r\ncame again, larger and more distinct than before. There was no doubt\r\nnow. Whatever had startled the moose-bird was coming slowly,\r\nnoiselessly.\r\n\r\nWabi brought his rifle to his shoulder. Life and death hovered with his\r\nanxious, naked finger over the gun trigger. But he was too well trained\r\nin the ways of the wilderness to fire just yet. Yard by yard the shadow\r\napproached, and divided itself into two shadows. Wabi could now see that\r\nthey were men. They were advancing in a cautious, crouching attitude, as\r\nthough they expected to meet enemies somewhere ahead of them. Wabi's\r\nheart thumped with joy. There could be no surer sign that Mukoki and Rod\r\nwere still among the living, for why should the Woongas employ this\r\ncaution if they had already successfully ambushed the hunters? With the\r\nchill of a cold hand at his throat the answer flashed into Wabigoon's\r\nbrain. His friends had been ambushed, and these two Woongas were\r\nstealing back over the trail to slay him!\r\n\r\nVery slowly, very gently, the young Indian's finger pressed against the\r\ntrigger of his rifle. A dozen feet more, and then--\r\n\r\nThe shadows had stopped, and now drew together as if in consultation.\r\nThey were not more than twenty yards away, and for a moment Wabi lowered\r\nhis rifle and listened hard. He could hear the low unintelligible\r\nmutterings of their conversation. Then there came to him a single\r\nincautious reply from one of the shadows.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\"\r\n\r\nSurely that was not the English of a Woonga! It sounded like--\r\n\r\nIn a flash Wabi had called softly.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, Muky--Muky--Rod!\"\r\n\r\nIn another moment the three wolf hunters were together, silently\r\nwringing one another's hands, the death-like pallor of Rod's face and\r\nthe tense lines in the bronzed countenances of Mukoki and Wabigoon\r\nplainly showing the tremendous strain they had been under.\r\n\r\n\"You shoot?\" whispered Mukoki.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" replied Wabi, his eyes widening in surprise. \"Didn't _you_ shoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\nOnly the one word fell from the old Indian, but it was filled with a new\r\nwarning. Who had fired the five shots? The hunters gazed blankly at one\r\nanother, mute questioning in their eyes. Without speaking, Mukoki\r\npointed suggestively to the clearer channel of the river beyond the\r\ncedars. Evidently he thought the shots had come from there. Wabi shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"There was no trail,\" he whispered. \"Nobody has crossed the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought they were there!\" breathed Rod. He pointed into the forest.\r\n\"But Mukoki said no.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time the three stood and listened. Half a mile back in the\r\nforest they heard the howl of a single wolf, and Wabi flashed a curious\r\nglance into the eyes of the old Indian.\r\n\r\n\"That's a man's cry,\" he whispered. \"The wolf has struck a human trail.\r\nIt isn't mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor ours,\" replied Rod.\r\n\r\nThis one long howl of the wolf was the only sound that broke the\r\nstillness of approaching night. Mukoki turned, and the others followed\r\nin his trail. A quarter of a mile farther on the stream became still\r\nnarrower and plunged between great masses of rock which rose into wild\r\nand precipitous hills that were almost mountains a little way back. No\r\nlonger could the hunters now follow the channel of the rushing torrent.\r\nThrough a break in a gigantic wall of rock and huge boulders led the\r\ntrail of Rod and Mukoki. Ten minutes more and the three had clambered to\r\nthe top of the ridge where, in the lee of a great rock, the remains of a\r\nfire were still burning. Here the old Indian and his companion had\r\nstruck camp and were waiting for Wabigoon when they heard the shots\r\nwhich they, too, believed were those of an ambush.\r\n\r\nA comfortable shelter of balsam had already been erected against the\r\nrock, and close beside the fire, where Mukoki had dropped it at the\r\nsound of the shots, was a large piece of spitted venison. The situation\r\nwas ideal for a camp and after the hard day's tramp through the snow the\r\nyoung wolf hunters regarded it with expressions of pleasure, in spite of\r\nthe enemies whom they knew might be lurking near them. Both Wabi and Rod\r\nhad accepted the place as their night's home, and were stirring up the\r\nfire, when their attention was drawn to the singular attitude of Mukoki.\r\nThe old warrior stood leaning on his rifle, speechless and motionless,\r\nhis eyes regarding the process of rekindling the fire with mute\r\ndisapprobation. Wabi, poised on one knee, looked at him questioningly.\r\n\r\n\"No make more fire,\" said the old Indian, shaking his head. \"No dare\r\nstay here. Go on--beyond mountain!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki straightened himself and stretched a long arm toward the north.\r\n\r\n\"River go like much devil 'long edge of mountain,\" he continued. \"Make\r\nheap noise through rock, then make swamp thick for cow moose--then run\r\nthrough mountain and make wide, smooth river once more. We go over\r\nmountain. Snow all night. Morning come--no trail for Woonga. We stay\r\nhere--make big trail in morning. Woonga follow like devil, ver' plain to\r\nsee!\"\r\n\r\nWabi rose to his feet, his face showing the keenness of his\r\ndisappointment. Since early morning he had been traveling, even running\r\nat times, and he was tired enough to risk willingly a few dangers for\r\nthe sake of sleep and supper. Rod was in even worse condition, though\r\nhis trail had been much shorter. For a few moments the two boys looked\r\nat each other in silence, neither attempting to conceal the lack of\r\nfavor with which Mukoki's suggestion was received. But Wabi was too wise\r\nopenly to oppose the old pathfinder. If Mukoki said that it was\r\ndangerous for them to remain where they were during the night--well, it\r\nwas dangerous, and it would be foolish of him to dispute it. He knew\r\nMukoki to be the greatest hunter of his tribe, a human bloodhound on the\r\ntrail, and what he said was law. So with a cheerful grin at Rod, who\r\nneeded all the encouragement that could be given to him, Wabi began the\r\nreadjustment of the pack which he had flung from his shoulders a few\r\nminutes before.\r\n\r\n\"Mountain not ver' far. Two--t'ree mile, then camp,\" encouraged Mukoki.\r\n\"Walk slow--have big supper.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few articles had been taken from the toboggan-sled on which the\r\nhunters were dragging the greater part of their equipment into the\r\nwilderness, and Mukoki soon had these packed again. The three\r\nadventurers now took up the new trail along the top of one of those wild\r\nand picturesque ridges which both the Indians and white hunters of this\r\ngreat Northland call mountains. Wabigoon led, weighted under his pack,\r\nselecting the clearest road for the toboggan and clipping down\r\nobstructing saplings with his keen-edged belt-ax. A dozen feet behind\r\nhim followed Mukoki, dragging the sled; and behind the sled, securely\r\ntied with a thong of babeesh, or moose-skin rope, slunk the wolf. Rod,\r\nless experienced in making a trail and burdened with a lighter pack,\r\nformed the rear of the little cavalcade.\r\n\r\nDarkness was now falling rapidly. Though Wabigoon was not more than a\r\ndozen yards ahead, Rod could only now and then catch a fleeting vision\r\nof him through the gloom. Mukoki, doubled over in his harness, was\r\nhardly more than a blotch in the early night. Only the wolf was near\r\nenough to offer companionship to the tired and down-spirited youth.\r\nRod's enthusiasm was not easily cooled, but just now he mentally wished\r\nthat, for this one night at least, he was back at the Post, with the\r\nlovely little Minnetaki relating to him some legend of bird or beast\r\nthey had encountered that day. How much pleasanter that would be! The\r\nvision of the bewitching little maiden was suddenly knocked out of his\r\nhead in a most unexpected and startling way. Mukoki had paused for a\r\nmoment and Rod, unconscious of the fact, continued on his journey until\r\nhe tumbled in a sprawling heap over the sled, knocking Mukoki's legs\r\ncompletely from under him in his fall. When Wabi ran back he found Rod\r\nflattened out, face downward, and Mukoki entangled in his site harness\r\non top of him.\r\n\r\nIn a way this accident was fortunate. Wabi, who possessed a Caucasian\r\nsense of humor, shook with merriment as he gave his assistance, and Rod,\r\nafter he had dug the snow from his eyes and ears and had emptied a\r\nhandful of it from his neck, joined with him.\r\n\r\nThe ridge now became narrower as the trio advanced. On one side, far\r\ndown, could be heard the thunderous rush of the river, and from the\r\ndirection of the sound Rod knew they were near a precipice. Great beds\r\nof boulders and broken rock, thrown there by some tumultuous upheaval of\r\npast ages, now impeded their progress, and every step was taken with\r\nextreme caution. The noise of the torrent became louder and louder as\r\nthey advanced and on one side of him Rod now thought that he could\r\ndistinguish a dim massive shadow towering above them, like the\r\nprecipitous side of a mountain. A few steps farther and Mukoki exchanged\r\nplaces with Wabigoon.\r\n\r\n\"Muky has been here before,\" cried Wabi close up to Rod's ear. His voice\r\nwas almost drowned by the tumult below. \"That's where the river rushes\r\nthrough the mountain!\"\r\n\r\nRod forgot his fatigue in the new excitement. Never in his wildest\r\ndreams of adventure had he foreseen an hour like this. Each step seemed\r\nto bring them nearer the edge of the vast chasm through which the river\r\nplunged, and yet not a sign of it could he see. He strained his eyes and\r\nears, each moment expecting to hear the warning voice of the old\r\nwarrior. With a suddenness that chilled him he saw the great shadow\r\nclose in upon them from the opposite side, and for the first time he\r\nrealized their position. On their left was the precipice--on their right\r\nthe sheer wall of the mountain! How wide was the ledge along which they\r\nwere traveling? His foot struck a stick under the snow. Catching it up\r\nhe flung it out into space. For a single instant he paused to listen,\r\nbut there came no sound of the falling object. The precipice was very\r\nnear--a little chill ran up his spine. It was a sensation he had never\r\nexperienced in walking the streets of a city!\r\n\r\nThough he could not see, he knew that the ledge was now leading them up.\r\nHe could hear Wabigoon straining ahead of the toboggan and he began to\r\nassist by pushing on the rear of the loaded sled. For half an hour this\r\nupward climb continued, until the sound of the river had entirely died\r\naway. No longer was the mountain on the right. Five minutes later Mukoki\r\ncalled a halt.\r\n\r\n\"On top mountain,\" he said briefly. \"Camp here!\"\r\n\r\nRod could not repress an exclamation of joy, and Wabigoon, as he threw\r\noff his harness, gave a suppressed whoop. Mukoki, who seemed tireless,\r\nbegan an immediate search for a site for their camp and after a short\r\nbreathing-spell Rod and Wabi joined him. The spot chosen was in the\r\nshelter of a huge rock, and while Mukoki cleaned away the snow the young\r\nhunters set to work with their axes in a near growth of balsam, cutting\r\narmful after armful of the soft odorous boughs. Inside of an hour a\r\ncomfortable camp was completed, with an exhilarating fire throwing its\r\ncrackling flames high up into the night before it.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since leaving the abandoned camp at the other end of\r\nthe ridge the hunters fully realized how famished they were, and Mukoki\r\nwas at once delegated to prepare supper while Wabi and Rod searched in\r\nthe darkness for their night's supply of wood. Fortunately quite near at\r\nhand they discovered several dead poplars, the best fuel in the world\r\nfor a camp-fire, and by the time the venison and coffee were ready they\r\nhad collected a huge pile of this, together with several good-sized\r\nbacklogs.\r\n\r\nMukoki had spread the feast in the opening of the shelter where the heat\r\nof the fire, reflected from the face of the rock, fell upon them in\r\ngenial warmth, suffusing their faces with a most comfortable glow. The\r\nheat, together with the feast, were almost overpowering in their\r\neffects, and hardly was his supper completed when Rod felt creeping over\r\nhim a drowsiness which he attempted in vain to fight off a little\r\nlonger. Dragging himself back in the shelter he wrapped himself in his\r\nblanket, burrowed into the mass of balsam boughs, and passed quickly\r\ninto oblivion. His last intelligible vision was Mukoki piling logs upon\r\nthe fire, while the flames shot up a dozen feet into the air, illumining\r\nto his drowsy eyes for an instant a wild chaos of rock, beyond which lay\r\nthe mysterious and impenetrable blackness of the wilderness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMUKOKI DISTURBS THE ANCIENT SKELETONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCompletely exhausted, every muscle in his aching body still seeming to\r\nstrain with exertion, the night was one of restless and uncomfortable\r\ndreams for Roderick Drew. While Wabi and the old Indian, veterans in\r\nwilderness hardship, slept in peace and tranquillity, the city boy found\r\nhimself in the most unusual and thrilling situations from which he would\r\nextricate himself with a grunt or sharp cry, several times sitting bolt\r\nupright in his bed of balsam until he realized where he was, and that\r\nhis adventures were only those of dreamland.\r\n\r\nFrom one of these dreams Rod had aroused himself into drowsy\r\nwakefulness. He fancied that he had heard steps. For the tenth time he\r\nraised himself upon an elbow, stretched, rubbed his eyes, glanced at the\r\ndark, inanimate forms of his sleeping companions, and snuggled down into\r\nhis balsam boughs again. A few moments later he sat bolt upright. He\r\ncould have sworn that he heard real steps this time--a soft cautious\r\ncrunching in the snow very near his head. Breathlessly he listened. Not\r\na sound broke the silence except the snapping of a dying ember in the\r\nfire. Another dream! Once more he settled back, drawing his blanket\r\nclosely about him. Then, for a full breath, the very beating of his\r\nheart seemed to cease.\r\n\r\nWhat was that!\r\n\r\nHe was awake now, wide awake, with every faculty in him striving to\r\narrange itself. He had heard--a step! Slowly, very cautiously this time,\r\nhe raised himself. There came distinctly to his ears a light crunching\r\nin the snow. It seemed back of the shelter--then was moving away, then\r\nstopped. The flickering light of the dying fire still played on the face\r\nof the great rock. Suddenly, at the very end of that rock, something\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nSome object was creeping cautiously upon the sleeping camp!\r\n\r\nFor a moment his thrilling discovery froze the young hunter into\r\ninaction. But in a moment the whole situation flashed upon him. The\r\nWoongas had followed them! They were about to fall upon the helpless\r\ncamp! Unexpectedly one of his hands came in contact with the barrel of\r\nWabi's rifle. The touch of the cold steel aroused him. There was no time\r\nto awaken his companions. Even as he drew the gun to him he saw the\r\nobject grow larger and larger at the end of the rock, until it stood\r\ncrouching, as if about to spring.\r\n\r\nOne bated breath--a thunderous report--a snarling scream of pain, and\r\nthe camp was awake!\r\n\r\n\"We're attacked!\" cried Rod. \"Quick--Wabi--Mukoki!\"\r\n\r\nThe white boy was on his knees now, the smoking rifle still leveled\r\ntoward the rocks. Out there, in the thick shadows beyond the fire, a\r\nbody was groveling and kicking in death agonies. In another instant the\r\ngaunt form of the old warrior was beside Rod, his rifle at his shoulder,\r\nand over their heads reached Wabigoon's arm, the barrel of his heavy\r\nrevolver glinting in the firelight.\r\n\r\nFor a full minute they crouched there, breathless, waiting.\r\n\r\n\"They've gone!\" broke Wabi in a tense whisper.\r\n\r\n\"I got one of them!\" replied Rod, his voice trembling with excitement.\r\n\r\nMukoki slipped back and burrowed a hole through the side of the shelter.\r\nHe could see nothing. Slowly he slipped out, his rifle ready. The others\r\ncould hear him as he went. Foot by foot the old warrior slunk along in\r\nthe deep gloom toward the end of the rock. Now he was almost there,\r\nnow--\r\n\r\nThe young hunters saw him suddenly straighten. There came to them a low\r\nchuckling grunt. He bent over, seized an object, and flung it in the\r\nlight of the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Heap big Woonga! Kill nice fat lynx!\"\r\n\r\nWith a wail, half feigned, half real, Rod flung himself back upon the\r\nbalsam while Wabi set up a roar that made the night echo. Mukoki's face\r\nwas creased in a broad grin.\r\n\r\n\"Heap big Woonga--heem!\" he repeated, chuckling. \"Nice fat lynx shot\r\nwell in face. No look like bad man Woonga to Mukoki!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Rod finally emerged from his den to join the others his face was\r\nflushed and wore what Wabi described as a \"sheepish grin.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right for you fellows to make fun of me,\" he declared. \"But\r\nwhat if they had been Woongas? By George, if we're ever attacked again I\r\nwon't do a thing. I'll let you fellows fight 'em off!\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the general merriment at his expense, Rod was immensely\r\nproud of his first lynx. It was an enormous creature of its kind, drawn\r\nby hunger to the scraps of the camp-fire feast; and it was this animal,\r\nas it cautiously inspected the camp, that the young hunter had heard\r\ncrunching in the snow. Wolf, whose instinct had told him what a mix-up\r\nwould mean, had slunk into his shelter without betraying his whereabouts\r\nto this arch-enemy of his tribe.\r\n\r\nWith the craft of his race, Mukoki was skinning the animal while it was\r\nstill warm.\r\n\r\n\"You go back bed,\" he said to his companions. \"I build big fire\r\nagain--then sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe excitement of his adventure at least freed Rod from the\r\nunpleasantness of further dreams, and it was late the following morning\r\nbefore he awoke again. He was astonished to find that a beautiful sun\r\nwas shining. Wabi and the old Indian were already outside preparing\r\nbreakfast, and the cheerful whistling of the former assured Rod that\r\nthere was now little to be feared from the Woongas. Without lingering to\r\ntake a beauty nap he joined them.\r\n\r\nEverywhere about them lay white winter. The rocks, the trees, and the\r\nmountain behind them were covered with two feet of snow and upon it the\r\nsun shone with dazzling brilliancy. But it was not until Rod looked into\r\nthe north that he saw the wilderness in all of its grandeur. The camp\r\nhad been made at the extreme point of the ridge, and stretching away\r\nunder his eyes, mile after mile, was the vast white desolation that\r\nreached to Hudson Bay. In speechless wonder he gazed down upon the\r\nunblazed forests, saw plains and hills unfold themselves as his vision\r\ngained distance, followed a river until it was lost in the bewildering\r\npicture, and let his eyes rest here and there upon the glistening,\r\nsnow-smothered bosoms of lakes, rimmed in by walls of black forest. This\r\nwas not the wilderness as he had expected it to be, nor as he had often\r\nread of it in books. It was beautiful! It was magnificent! His heart\r\nthrobbed with pleasure as he gazed down on it, the blood rose to his\r\nface in an excited flush, and he seemed hardly to breathe in his tense\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nMukoki had come up beside him softly, and spoke in his low guttural\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Twent' t'ousand moose down there--twent' t'ousand caribou-oo! No\r\nman--no house--more twent' t'ousand miles!\"\r\n\r\nRoderick, even trembling in his new emotion, looked into the old\r\nwarrior's face. In Mukoki's eyes there was a curious, thrilling gleam.\r\nHe stared straight out into the unending distance as though his keen\r\nvision would penetrate far beyond the last of that visible\r\ndesolation--on and on, even to the grim and uttermost fastnesses of\r\nHudson Bay. Wabi came up and placed his hand on Rod's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Muky was born off there,\" he said. \"Away beyond where we can see. Those\r\nwere his hunting-grounds when a boy. See that mountain yonder? You might\r\ntake it for a cloud. It's thirty miles from here! And that lake down\r\nthere--you might think a rifle-shot would reach it--is five miles away!\r\nIf a moose or a caribou or a wolf should cross it how you could see\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments longer the three stood silent, then Wabi and the old\r\nIndian returned to the fire to finish the preparation of breakfast,\r\nleaving Rod alone in his enchantment. What unsolved mysteries, what\r\nunwritten tragedies, what romance, what treasure of gold that vast North\r\nmust hold! For a thousand, perhaps a million centuries, it had lain thus\r\nundisturbed in the embrace of nature; few white men had broken its\r\nsolitudes, and the wild things still lived there as they had lived in\r\nthe winters of ages and ages ago.\r\n\r\nThe call to breakfast came almost as an unpleasant interruption to Rod.\r\nBut it did not shock his appetite as it had his romantic fancies, and he\r\nperformed his part at the morning meal with considerable credit. Wabi\r\nand Mukoki had already decided that they would not take up the trail\r\nagain that day but would remain in their present camp until the\r\nfollowing morning. There were several reasons for this delay.\r\n\r\n\"We can't travel without snow-shoes now,\" explained Wabi to Rod, \"and\r\nwe've got to take a day off to teach you how to use them. Then, all the\r\nwild things are lying low. Moose, deer, caribou, and especially wolves\r\nand fur animals, won't begin traveling much until this afternoon and\r\nto-night, and if we took up the trail now we would have no way of\r\ntelling what kind of a game country we were in. And that is the\r\nimportant thing just now. If we strike a first-rate game country during\r\nthe next couple days we'll stop and build our winter camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you believe we are far enough away from the Woongas?\" asked Rod.\r\n\r\nMukoki grunted.\r\n\r\n\"No believe Woongas come over mountain. Heap good game country back\r\nthere. They stay.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the meal the white boy asked a hundred questions about the vast\r\nwilderness which lay stretched out before them in a great panorama, and\r\nin which they were soon to bury themselves, and every answer added to\r\nhis enthusiasm. Immediately after they had finished eating Rod expressed\r\na desire to begin his study in snow-shoeing, and for an hour after that\r\nWabi and Mukoki piloted him back and forth along the ridge, instructing\r\nhim in this and in that, applauding when he made an especially good dash\r\nand enjoying themselves immensely when he took one of his frequent\r\ntumbles into the snow. By noon Rod secretly believed that he was\r\nbecoming quite an adept.\r\n\r\nAlthough the day in camp was an exceedingly pleasant one for Rod, he\r\ncould not but observe that at times something seemed to be troubling\r\nWabi. Twice he discovered the Indian youth alone within the shelter\r\nsitting in silent and morose dejection, and finally he insisted upon an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to tell me what the trouble is, Wabi,\" he demanded. \"What\r\nhas gone wrong?\"\r\n\r\nWabi jumped to his feet with a little laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever have a dream that bothered you, Rod?\" he asked. \"Well, I\r\nhad one last night, and since then--somehow--I can't keep from worrying\r\nabout the people back at the Post, and especially about Minnetaki. It's\r\nall--what do you call it--bosh? Listen! Wasn't that Mukoki's whistle?\"\r\n\r\nAs he paused Mukoki came running around the end of the rock.\r\n\r\n\"See fun!\" he cried softly. \"Quick--see heem quick!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and darted toward the precipitous edge of the ridge, closely\r\nfollowed by the two boys.\r\n\r\n\"Cari-boo-oo!\" he whispered excitedly as they came up beside him.\r\n\"Cari-boo-oo--making big play!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed down into the snowy wilderness. Three-quarters of a mile\r\naway, though to Rod apparently not more than a third of that distance\r\nfrom where they stood, half a dozen animals were disporting themselves\r\nin a singular fashion in a meadow-like opening between the mountain and\r\na range of forest. It was Rod's first real glimpse of that wonderful\r\nanimal of the North of which he had read so much, the caribou--commonly\r\nknown beyond the Sixtieth Degree as the reindeer; and at this moment\r\nthose below him were indulging in the queer play known in the Hudson Bay\r\nregions as the \"caribou dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with them?\" he asked, his voice quivering with\r\nexcitement. \"What--\"\r\n\r\n\"Making big fun!\" chuckled Mukoki, drawing the boy closer to the rock\r\nthat concealed them.\r\n\r\nWabi had thrust a finger in his mouth and now held it above his head,\r\nthe Indian's truest guide for discovering the direction of the wind. The\r\nlee side of his finger remained cold and damp, while that side upon\r\nwhich the breeze fell was quickly dried.\r\n\r\n\"The wind is toward us, Muky,\" he announced. \"There's a fine chance for\r\na shot. You go! Rod and I will stay here and watch you.\"\r\n\r\nRoderick heard--knew that Mukoki was creeping back to the camp for his\r\nrifle, but not for an instant did his spellbound eyes leave the\r\nspectacle below him. Two other animals had joined those in the open. He\r\ncould see the sun glistening on their long antlers as they tossed their\r\nheads in their amazing antics. Now three or four of them would dash away\r\nwith the speed of the wind, as though the deadliest of enemies were\r\nclose behind them. Two or three hundred yards away they would stop with\r\nequal suddenness, whirl about in a circle, as though flight were\r\ninterrupted on all sides of them, then tear back with lightning speed to\r\nrejoin the herd. In twos and threes and fours they performed these\r\nevolutions again and again. But there was another antic that held Rod's\r\neyes, and if it had not been so new and wonderful to him he would have\r\nlaughed, as Wabi was doing--silently--behind him. From out of the herd\r\nwould suddenly dash one of the agile creatures, whirl about, jump and\r\nkick, and finally bounce up and down on all four feet, as though\r\nperforming a comedy sketch in pantomime for the amusement of its\r\ncompanions; and when this was done it would start out in another mad\r\nflight, with others of the herd at its heels.\r\n\r\n\"They are the funniest, swiftest, and shrewdest animals in the North,\"\r\nsaid Wabi. \"They can smell you over a mountain if the wind is right, and\r\nhear you for half a mile. Look!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed downward over Rod's shoulder. Mukoki had already reached the\r\nbase of the ridge and was stealing straight out in the direction of the\r\ncaribou. Rod gave a surprised gasp.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! They'll see him, won't they?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Not if Mukoki knows himself,\" smiled the Indian youth. \"Remember that\r\nwe are looking down on things. Everything seems clear and open to us,\r\nwhile in reality it's quite thick down there. I'll bet Muky can't see\r\none hundred yards ahead of him. He has got his bearings and will go as\r\nstraight as though he was on a blazed trail; but he won't see the\r\ncaribou until he conies to the edge of the open.\"\r\n\r\nEach minute now added to Rod's excitement. Each of those minutes brought\r\nthe old warrior nearer his game. Seldom, thought Rod, had such a scene\r\nbeen unfolded to the eyes of a white boy. The complete picture--the\r\nplayful rompings of the dumb children of the wilderness; the stealthy\r\napproach of the old Indian; every rock, every tree that was to play its\r\npart--all were revealed to their eyes. Not a phase in this drama in wild\r\nlife escaped them. Five minutes, ten, fifteen passed. They could see\r\nMukoki as he stopped and lifted a hand to test the wind. Then he\r\ncrouched, advancing foot by foot, yard by yard, so slowly that he seemed\r\nto be on his hands and knees.\r\n\r\n\"He can hear them, but he can't see them!\" breathed Wabigoon. \"See! He\r\nplaces his ear to the ground! Now he has got his bearings again--as\r\nstraight as a die! Good old Muky!\"\r\n\r\nThe old Indian crept on. In his excitement Rod clenched his hands and he\r\nseemed to live without breathing. Would Mukoki never shoot? Would he\r\n_never_ shoot? He seemed now to be within a stone's throw of the herd.\r\n\r\n\"How far, Wabi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred yards, perhaps five,\" replied the Indian. \"It's a long\r\nshot! He can't see them yet.\"\r\n\r\nRod gripped his companion's arm.\r\n\r\nMukoki had stopped. Down and down he slunk, until he became only a blot\r\nin the snow.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\"\r\n\r\nThere came a moment of startled silence. In the midst of their play the\r\nanimals in the open stood for a single instant paralyzed by a knowledge\r\nof impending danger, and in that instant there came to the young hunters\r\nthe report of Mukoki's rifle.\r\n\r\n\"No good!\" cried Wabi.\r\n\r\nIn his excitement he leaped to his feet. The caribou had turned and the\r\nwhole eight of them were racing across the open. Another shot, and\r\nanother--three in quick succession, and one of the fleeing animals fell,\r\nscrambled to its knees--and plunged on again! A fifth shot--the last in\r\nMukoki's rifle! Again the wounded animal fell, struggled to its\r\nknees--to its forefeet--and fell again.\r\n\r\n\"Good work! Five hundred yards if it was a foot!\" exclaimed Wabigoon\r\nwith a relieved laugh. \"Fresh steak for supper, Rod!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki came out into the open, reloading his rifle. Quickly he moved\r\nacross the wilderness playground, now crimson with blood, unsheathed his\r\nknife, and dropped upon his knees close to the throat of the slain\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go down and give him a little help, Rod,\" said Wabi. \"Your legs\r\nare pretty sore, and it's a hard climb down there; so if you will keep\r\nup the fire, Mukoki and I will bring back the meat.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next hour Rod busied himself with collecting firewood for the\r\nnight and in practising with his snow-shoes. He was astonished to find\r\nhow swiftly and easily he could travel in them, and was satisfied that\r\nhe could make twenty miles a day even as a tenderfoot.\r\n\r\nLeft to his own thoughts he found his mind recurring once more to the\r\nWoongas and Minnetaki. Why was Wabi worried? Inwardly he did not believe\r\nthat it was a dream alone that was troubling him. There was still some\r\ncause for fear. Of that he was certain. And why would not the Woongas\r\npenetrate beyond this mountain? He had asked himself this question a\r\nscore of times during the last twenty-four hours, in spite of the fact\r\nthat both Mukoki and Wabigoon were quite satisfied that they were well\r\nout of the Woonga territory.\r\n\r\nIt was growing dusk when Wabi and the old Indian returned with the meat\r\nof the caribou. No time was lost in preparing supper, for the hunters\r\nhad decided that the next day's trail would begin with dawn and probably\r\nend with darkness, which meant that they would require all the rest they\r\ncould get before then. They were all eager to begin the winter's hunt.\r\nThat day Mukoki's eyes had glistened at each fresh track he encountered.\r\nWabi and Rod were filled with enthusiasm. Even Wolf, now and then\r\nstretching his gaunt self, would nose the air with eager suspicion, as\r\nif longing for the excitement of the tragedies in which he was to play\r\nsuch an important part.\r\n\r\n\"If you can stand it,\" said Wabi, nodding at Rod over his caribou steak,\r\n\"we won't lose a minute from now on. Over that country we ought to make\r\ntwenty-five or thirty miles to-morrow. We may strike our hunting-ground\r\nby noon, or it may take us two or three days; but in either event we\r\nhaven't any time to waste. Hurrah for the big camp, I say--and our fun\r\nbegins!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Rod as though he had hardly fallen asleep that night when\r\nsomebody began tumbling him about in his bed of balsam. Opening his eyes\r\nhe beheld Wabi's laughing face, illuminated in the glow of a roaring\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Time's up!\" he called cheerily. \"Hustle out, Rod. Breakfast is sizzling\r\nhot, everything is packed, and here you are still dreaming of--what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Minnetaki!\" shot back Rod with unblushing honesty.\r\n\r\nIn another minute he was outside, straightening his disheveled garments\r\nand smoothing his tousled hair. It was still very dark, but Rod assured\r\nhimself by his watch that it was nearly four o'clock. Mukoki had already\r\nplaced their breakfast on a flat rock beside the fire and, according to\r\nWabigoon's previous scheme, no time was lost in disposing of it.\r\n\r\nDawn was just breaking when the little cavalcade of adventurers set out\r\nfrom the camp. More keenly than ever Rod now felt the loss of his rifle.\r\nThey were about to enter upon a hunter's paradise--and he had no gun!\r\nHis disappointment was acute and he could not repress a confession of\r\nhis feelings to Wabi. The Indian youth at once suggested a happy remedy.\r\nThey would take turns in using his gun, Rod to have it one day and he\r\nthe next; and Wabi's heavy revolver would also change hands, so that the\r\none who did not possess the rifle would be armed with the smaller\r\nweapon. This solution of the difficulty lifted a dampening burden from\r\nRod's heart, and when the little party began its descent into the\r\nwilderness regions under the mountain the city lad carried the rifle,\r\nfor Wabi insisted that he have the first \"turn.\"\r\n\r\nOnce free of the rock-strewn ridge the two boys joined forces in pulling\r\nthe toboggan while Mukoki struck out a trail ahead of them. As it became\r\nlighter Rod found his eyes glued with keen interest to Mukoki's\r\nsnow-shoes, and for the first time in his life he realized what it\r\nreally meant to \"make a trail.\" The old Indian was the most famous\r\ntrailmaker as well as the keenest trailer of his tribe, and in the\r\ncomparatively open bottoms through which they were now traveling he was\r\nin his element. His strides were enormous, and with each stride he threw\r\nup showers of snow, leaving a broad level path behind him in which the\r\nsnow was packed by his own weight, so that when Wabi and Rod came to\r\nfollow him they were not impeded by sinking into a soft surface.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile from the mountain Mukoki stopped and waited for the others\r\nto come up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Moose!\" he called, pointing at a curious track in the snow.\r\n\r\nRod leaned eagerly over the track.\r\n\r\n\"The snow is still crumbling and falling where he stepped,\" said Wabi.\r\n\"Watch that little chunk, Rod. See--it's slipping--down--down--there! It\r\nwas an old bull--a big fellow--and he passed here less than an hour\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\nSigns of the night carnival of the wild things now became more and more\r\nfrequent as the hunters advanced. They crossed and recrossed the trail\r\nof a fox; and farther on they discovered where this little pirate of\r\ndarkness had slaughtered a big white rabbit. The snow was covered with\r\nblood and hair and part of the carcass remained uneaten. Again Wabi\r\nforgot his determination to waste no time and paused to investigate.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if we only knew what kind of a fox he was!\" he exclaimed to Rod.\r\n\"But we don't. All we know is that he's a fox. And all fox tracks are\r\nalike, no matter what kind of a fox makes them. If there was only some\r\ndifference our fortunes would be made!\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" asked Rod.\r\n\r\nMukoki chuckled as if the mere thought of such a possibility filled him\r\nwith glee.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that fellow may be an ordinary red fox,\" explained the Indian\r\nyouth. \"If so, he is only worth from ten to twenty dollars; or he may be\r\na black fox, worth fifty or sixty; or what we call a 'cross'--a mixture\r\nof silver and black--worth from seventy-five to a hundred. Or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Heap big silver!\" interrupted Mukoki with another chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, or a silver,\" finished Wabi. \"A poor silver is worth two hundred\r\ndollars, and a good one from five hundred to a thousand! Now do you see\r\nwhy we would like to have a difference in the tracks? If that was a\r\nsilver, a black or a 'cross,' we'd follow him; but in all probability he\r\nis red.\"\r\n\r\nEvery hour added to Rod's knowledge of the wilderness and its people.\r\nFor the first time in his life he saw the big dog-like tracks made by\r\nwolves, the dainty hoof-prints of the red deer and the spreading\r\nimprints of a traveling lynx; he pictured the hugeness of the moose that\r\nmade a track as big as his head, discovered how to tell the difference\r\nbetween the hoof-print of a small moose and a big caribou, and in almost\r\nevery mile learned something new.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen times during the morning the hunters stopped to rest. By\r\nnoon Wabi figured that they had traveled twenty miles, and, although\r\nvery tired, Rod declared that he was still \"game for another ten.\" After\r\ndinner the aspect of the country changed. The river which they had been\r\nfollowing became narrower and was so swift in places that it rushed\r\ntumultuously between its frozen edges. Forest-clad hills, huge boulders\r\nand masses of rock now began to mingle again with the bottoms, which in\r\nthis country are known as plains. Every mile added to the roughness and\r\npicturesque grandeur of the country. A few miles to the east rose\r\nanother range of wild and rugged hills; small lakes became more and more\r\nnumerous, and everywhere the hunters crossed and recrossed frozen\r\ncreeks.\r\n\r\nAnd each step they took now added to the enthusiasm of Wabi and his\r\ncompanions. Evidences of game and fur animals were plenty. A thousand\r\nideal locations for a winter camp were about them, and their progress\r\nbecame slow and studied.\r\n\r\nA gently sloping hill of considerable height now lay in their path and\r\nMukoki led the ascent. At the top the three paused in joyful\r\nastonishment. At their feet lay a \"dip,\" or hollow, a dozen acres in\r\nextent, and in the center of this dip was a tiny lake partly surrounded\r\nby a mixed forest of cedar, balsam and birch that swept back over the\r\nhill, and partly inclosed by a meadow-like opening. One might have\r\ntraveled through the country a thousand times without discovering this\r\nbit of wilderness paradise hidden in a hilltop. Without speaking Mukoki\r\nthrew off his heavy pack. Wabi unbuckled his harness and relieved his\r\nshoulders of their burden. Rod, following their example, dropped his\r\nsmall pack beside that of the old Indian, and Wolf, straining at his\r\nbabeesh thong, gazed with eager eyes into the hollow as though he, too,\r\nknew that it was to be their winter home.\r\n\r\nWabi broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"How is that, Muky?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nMukoki chuckled with unbounded satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Ver' fine. No get bad wind--never see smoke--plenty wood--plenty\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nRelieved of their burdens, and leaving Wolf tied to the toboggan, the\r\nhunters made their way down to the lake. Hardly had they reached its\r\nedge when Wabi halted with a startled exclamation and pointed into the\r\nforest on the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that!\"\r\n\r\nA hundred yards away, almost concealed among the trees, was a cabin.\r\nEven from where they stood they could see that it was deserted. Snow was\r\ndrifted high about it. No chimney surmounted its roof. Nowhere was there\r\na sign of life.\r\n\r\nSlowly the hunters approached. It was evident that the cabin was very\r\nold. The logs of which it was built were beginning to decay. A mass of\r\nsaplings had taken root upon its roof, and everything about it gave\r\nevidence that it had been erected many years before. The door, made of\r\nsplit timber and opening toward the lake, was closed; the one window,\r\nalso opening upon the lake, was tightly barred with lengths of sapling.\r\n\r\nMukoki tried the door, but it resisted his efforts. Evidently it was\r\nstrongly barred from within.\r\n\r\nCuriosity now gave place to astonishment.\r\n\r\nHow could the door be locked within, and the window barred from within,\r\nwithout there being somebody inside?\r\n\r\nFor a few moments the three stood speechless, listening.\r\n\r\n\"Looks queer, doesn't it?\" spoke Wabi softly.\r\n\r\nMukoki had dropped on his knees beside the door. He could hear no sound.\r\nThen he kicked off his snow-shoes, gripped his belt-ax and stepped to\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nA dozen blows and one of the bars fell. The old Indian sniffed\r\nsuspiciously, his ear close to the opening. Damp, stifling air greeted\r\nhis nostrils, but still there was no sound. One after another he knocked\r\noff the remaining bars and thrust his head and shoulders inside.\r\nGradually his eyes became accustomed to the darkness and he pulled\r\nhimself in.\r\n\r\nHalf-way--and he stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, Muky,\" urged Wabi, who was pressing close behind.\r\n\r\nThere came no answer from the old Indian. For a full minute he remained\r\npoised there, as motionless as a stone, as silent as death.\r\n\r\nThen, very slowly--inch by inch, as though afraid of awakening a\r\nsleeping person, he lowered himself to the ground. When he turned toward\r\nthe young hunters it was with an expression that Rod had never seen upon\r\nMukoki's face before.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mukoki?\"\r\n\r\nThe old Indian gasped, as if for fresh air.\r\n\r\n\"Cabin--she filled with twent' t'ousand dead men!\" he replied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Knife--fight--heem killed!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nRODERICK DISCOVERS THE BUCKSKIN BAG\r\n\r\n\r\nFor one long breath Rod and Wabi stared at their companion, only half\r\nbelieving, yet startled by the strange look in the old warrior's face.\r\n\r\n\"Twent' t'ousand dead men!\" he repeated. As he raised his hand, partly\r\nto give emphasis and partly to brush the cobwebs from his face, the boys\r\nsaw it trembling in a way that even Wabi had never witnessed before.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\"\r\n\r\nIn another instant Wabi was at the window, head and shoulders in, as\r\nMukoki had been before him. After a little he pulled himself back and as\r\nhe glanced at Rod he laughed in an odd thrilling way, as though he had\r\nbeen startled, but not so much so as Mukoki, who had prepared him for\r\nthe sight which had struck his own vision with the unexpectedness of a\r\nshot in the back.\r\n\r\n\"Take a look, Rod!\"\r\n\r\nWith his breath coming in little uneasy jerks Rod approached the black\r\naperture. A queer sensation seized upon him--a palpitation, not of fear,\r\nbut of something; a very unpleasant feeling that seemed to choke his\r\nbreath, and made him wish that he had not been asked to peer into that\r\nmysterious darkness. Slowly he thrust his head through the hole. It was\r\nas black as night inside. But gradually the darkness seemed to be\r\ndispelled. He saw, in a little while, the opposite wall of the cabin. A\r\ntable outlined itself in deep shadows, and near the table there was a\r\npile of something that he could not name; and tumbled over that was a\r\nchair, with an object that might have been an old rag half covering it.\r\n\r\nHis eyes traveled nearer. Outside Wabi and Mukoki heard a startled,\r\npartly suppressed cry. The boy's hands gripped the sides of the window.\r\nFascinated, he stared down upon an object almost within arm's reach of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere, leaning against the cabin wall, was what half a century or more\r\nago had been a living man! Now it was a mere skeleton, a grotesque,\r\nterrible-looking object, its empty eye-sockets gleaming dully with the\r\nlight from the window, its grinning mouth, distorted into ghostly life\r\nby the pallid mixture of light and gloom, turned full up at him!\r\n\r\nRod fell back, trembling and white.\r\n\r\n\"I only saw one,\" he gasped, remembering Mukoki's excited estimate.\r\n\r\nWabi, who had regained his composure, laughed as he struck him two or\r\nthree playful blows on the back. Mukoki only grunted.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't look long enough, Rod!\" he cried banteringly. \"He got on\r\nyour nerves too quick. I don't blame you, though. By George, I'll bet\r\nthe shivers went up Muky's back when he first saw 'em! I'm going in to\r\nopen the door.\"\r\n\r\nWithout trepidation the young Indian crawled through the window. Rod,\r\nwhose nervousness was quickly dispelled, made haste to follow him, while\r\nMukoki again threw his weight against the door. A few blows of Wabi's\r\nbelt-ax and the door shot inward so suddenly that the old Indian went\r\nsprawling after it upon all fours.\r\n\r\nA flood of light filled the interior of the cabin. Instinctively Rod's\r\neyes sought the skeleton against the wall. It was leaning as if, many\r\nyears before, a man had died there in a posture of sleep. Quite near\r\nthis ghastly tenant of the cabin, stretched at full length upon the log\r\nfloor, was a second skeleton, and near the overturned chair was a small\r\ncluttered heap of bones which were evidently those of some animal. Rod\r\nand Wabi drew nearer the skeleton against the wall and were bent upon\r\nmaking a closer examination when an exclamation from Mukoki attracted\r\ntheir attention to the old pathfinder. He was upon his knees beside the\r\nsecond skeleton, and as the boys approached he lifted eyes to them that\r\nwere filled with unbounded amazement, at the same time pointing a long\r\nforefinger to come object among the bones.\r\n\r\n\"Knife--fight--heem killed!\"\r\n\r\nPlunged to the hilt in what had once been the breast of a living being,\r\nthe boys saw a long, heavy-bladed knife, its handle rotting with age,\r\nits edges eaten by rust--but still erect, held there by the murderous\r\nroad its owner had cleft for it through the flesh and bone of his\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nRod, who had fallen upon his knees, gazed up blankly; his jaw dropped,\r\nand he asked the first question that popped into his head.\r\n\r\n\"Who--did it?\"\r\n\r\nMukoki chuckled, almost gleefully, and nodded toward the gruesome thing\r\nreclining against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Heem!\"\r\n\r\nMoved by a common instinct the three drew near the other skeleton. One\r\nof its long arms was resting across what had once been a pail, but\r\nwhich, long since, had sunk into total collapse between its hoops. The\r\nfinger-bones of this arm were still tightly shut, clutching between them\r\na roll of something that looked like birch-bark. The remaining arm had\r\nfallen close to the skeleton's side, and it was on this side that\r\nMukoki's critical eyes searched most carefully, his curiosity being\r\nalmost immediately satisfied by the discovery of a short, slant-wise cut\r\nin one of the ribs.\r\n\r\n\"This un die here!\" he explained. \"Git um stuck knife in ribs. Bad way\r\ndie! Much hurt--no die quick, sometime. Ver' bad way git stuck!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" shuddered Rod. \"This cabin hasn't had any fresh air in it for a\r\ncentury, I'll bet. Let's get out!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki, in passing, picked up a skull from the heap of bones near the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"Dog!\" he grunted. \"Door lock'--window shut--men fight--both kill. Dog\r\nstarve!\"\r\n\r\nAs the three retraced their steps to the spot where Wolf was guarding\r\nthe toboggan, Rod's imaginative mind quickly painted a picture of the\r\nterrible tragedy that had occurred long ago in the old cabin. To Mukoki\r\nand Wabigoon the discovery of the skeletons was simply an incident in a\r\nlong life of wilderness adventure--something of passing interest, but of\r\nsmall importance. To Rod it was the most tragic event that had ever come\r\ninto his city-bound existence, with the exception of the thrilling\r\nconflict at Wabinosh House. He reconstructed that deadly hour in the\r\ncabin; saw the men in fierce altercation, saw them struggling, and\r\nalmost heard the fatal blows as they were struck--the blows that slew\r\none with the suddenness of a lightning bolt and sent the other,\r\ntriumphant but dying, to breathe his last moments with his back propped\r\nagainst the wall. And the dog! What part had he taken? And after\r\nthat--long days of maddening loneliness, days of starvation and of\r\nthirst, until he, too, doubled himself up on the floor and died. It was\r\na terrible, a thrilling picture that burned in Roderick's brain. But why\r\nhad they quarreled? What cause had there been for that sanguinary night\r\nduel? Instinctively Rod accepted it as having occurred at night, for the\r\ndoor had been locked, the window barred. Just then he would have given a\r\ngood deal to have had the mystery solved.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the hill Rod awoke to present realities. Wabi, who had\r\nharnessed himself to the toboggan, was in high spirits.\r\n\r\n\"That cabin is a dandy!\" he exclaimed as Rod joined him. \"It would have\r\ntaken us at least two weeks to build as good a one. Isn't it luck?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to live in it?\" inquired his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Live in it! I should say we were. It is three times as big as the shack\r\nwe had planned to build. I can't understand why two men like those\r\nfellows should have put up such a large cabin. What do you think,\r\nMukoki?\"\r\n\r\nMukoki shook his head. Evidently the mystery of the whole thing, beyond\r\nthe fact that the tenants of the cabin had killed themselves in battle,\r\nwas beyond his comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe winter outfit was soon in a heap beside the cabin door.\r\n\r\n\"Now for cleaning up,\" announced Wabi cheerfully. \"Muky, you lend me a\r\nhand with the bones, will you? Rod can nose around and fetch out\r\nanything he likes.\"\r\n\r\nThis assignment just suited Rod's curiosity. He was now worked up to a\r\nfeverish pitch of expectancy. Might he not discover some clue that would\r\nlead to a solution of the mystery?\r\n\r\nOne question alone seemed to ring incessantly in his head. Why had they\r\nfought? _Why had they fought?_\r\n\r\nHe even found himself repeating this under his breath as he began\r\nrummaging about. He kicked over the old chair, which was made of\r\nsaplings nailed together, scrutinized a heap of rubbish that crumbled to\r\ndust under his touch, and gave a little cry of exultation when he found\r\ntwo guns leaning in a corner of the cabin. Their stocks were decaying;\r\ntheir locks were encased with rust, their barrels, too, were thick with\r\nthe accumulated rust of years. Carefully, almost tenderly, he took one\r\nof these relics of a past age in his hands. It was of ancient pattern,\r\nalmost as long as he was tall.\r\n\r\n\"Hudson Bay gun--the kind they had before my father was born!\" said\r\nWabi.\r\n\r\nWith bated breath and eagerly beating heart Rod pursued his search. On\r\none of the walls he found the remains of what had once been\r\ngarments--part of a hat, that fell in a thousand pieces when he touched\r\nit; the dust-rags of a coat and other things that he could not name. On\r\nthe table there were rusty pans, a tin pail, an iron kettle, and the\r\nremains of old knives, forks and spoons. On one end of this table there\r\nwas an unusual-looking object, and he touched it. Unlike the other rags\r\nit did not crumble, and when he lifted it he found that it was a small\r\nbag, made of buckskin, tied at the end--and heavy! With trembling\r\nfingers he tore away the rotted string and out upon the table there\r\nrattled a handful of greenish-black, pebbly looking objects.\r\n\r\nRod gave a sharp quick cry for the others.\r\n\r\nWabi and Mukoki had just come through the door after bearing out one of\r\ntheir gruesome loads, and the young Indian hurried to his side. He\r\nweighed one of the pieces in the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"It's lead, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Gold!\" breathed Rod.\r\n\r\nHe could hear his own heart thumping as Wabi jumped back to the light of\r\nthe door, his sheath-knife in his hand. For an instant the keen blade\r\nsank into the age-discolored object, and before Rod could see into the\r\ncrease that it made Wabi's voice rose in an excited cry.\r\n\r\n\"It's a gold nugget!\"\r\n\r\n\"And _that's_ why they fought!\" exclaimed Rod exultantly.\r\n\r\nHe had hoped--and he had discovered the reason. For a few moments this\r\nwas of more importance to him than the fact that he had found gold. Wabi\r\nand Mukoki were now in a panic of excitement. The buckskin bag was\r\nturned inside out; the table was cleared of every other object; every\r\nnook and cranny was searched with new enthusiasm. The searchers hardly\r\nspoke. Each was intent upon finding--finding--finding. Thus does\r\ngold--virgin gold--stir up the sparks of that latent, feverish fire\r\nwhich is in every man's soul. Again Rod joined in the search. Every rag,\r\nevery pile of dust, every bit of unrecognizable debris was torn, sifted\r\nand scattered. At the end of an hour the three paused, hopelessly\r\nbaffled, even keenly disappointed for the time.\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's all there is,\" said Wabi.\r\n\r\nIt was the longest sentence that he had spoken for half an hour.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one thing to do, boys. We'll clean out everything there\r\nis in the cabin, and to-morrow we'll tear up the floor. You can't tell\r\nwhat there might be under it, and we've got to have a new floor anyway.\r\nIt is getting dusk, and if we have this place fit to sleep in to-night\r\nwe have got to hustle.\"\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in getting the debris of the cabin outside, and by the\r\ntime darkness had fallen a mass of balsam boughs had been spread upon\r\nthe log floor just inside the door, blankets were out, packs and\r\nsupplies stowed away in one corner, and everything \"comfortable and\r\nshipshape,\" as Rod expressed it. A huge fire was built a few feet away\r\nfrom the open door and the light and heat from this made the interior of\r\nthe cabin quite light and warm, and, with the assistance of a couple of\r\ncandles, more home-like than any camp they had slept in thus far.\r\nMukoki's supper was a veritable feast--broiled caribou, cold beans that\r\nthe old Indian had cooked at their last camp, meal cakes and hot coffee.\r\nThe three happy hunters ate of it as though they had not tasted food for\r\na week.\r\n\r\nThe day, though a hard one, had been fraught with too much excitement\r\nfor them to retire to their blankets immediately after this meal, as\r\nthey had usually done in other camps. They realized, too, that they had\r\nreached the end of their journey and that their hardest work was over.\r\nThere was no long jaunt ahead of them to-morrow. Their new life--the\r\nhappiest life in the world to them--had already begun. Their camp was\r\nestablished, they were ready for their winter's sport, and from this\r\nmoment on they felt that their evenings were their own to do with as\r\nthey pleased.\r\n\r\nSo for many hours that night Rod, Mukoki and Wabigoon sat up and talked\r\nand kept the fire roaring before the door. Twenty times they went over\r\nthe tragedy of the old cabin; twenty times they weighed the half-pound\r\nof precious little lumps in the palms of their hands, and bit by bit\r\nthey built up that life romance of the days of long ago, when all this\r\nwilderness was still an unopened book to the white man. And that story\r\nseemed very clear to them now. These men had been prospectors. They had\r\ndiscovered gold. Afterward they had quarreled, probably over some\r\ndivision of it--perhaps over the ownership of the very nuggets they had\r\nfound; and then, in the heat of their anger, had followed the knife\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nBut where had they discovered the gold? That was the question of supreme\r\ninterest to the hunters, and they debated it until midnight. There were\r\nno mining tools in the camp; no pick, shovel or pan. Then it occurred to\r\nthem that the builders of the cabin had been hunters, had discovered\r\ngold by accident and had collected that in the buckskin bag without the\r\nuse of a pan.\r\n\r\nThere was little sleep in the camp that night, and with the first light\r\nof day the three were at work again. Immediately after breakfast the\r\ntask of tearing up the old and decayed floor began. One by one the split\r\nsaplings were pried up and carried out for firewood, until the earth\r\nfloor lay bare. Every foot of it was now eagerly turned over with a\r\nshovel which had been brought in the equipment; the base-logs were\r\nundermined, and filled in again; the moss that had been packed in the\r\nchinks between the cabin timbers was dug out, and by noon there was not\r\na square inch of the interior of the camp that had not been searched.\r\n\r\nThere was no more gold.\r\n\r\nIn a way this fact brought relief with it. Both Wabi and Rod gradually\r\nrecovered from their nervous excitement. The thought of gold gradually\r\nfaded from their minds; the joy and exhilaration of the \"hunt life\"\r\nfilled them more and more. Mukoki set to work cutting fresh cedars for\r\nthe floor; the two boys scoured every log with water from the lake and\r\nafterward gathered several bushels of moss for refilling the chinks.\r\nThat evening supper was cooked on the sheet-iron \"section stove\" which\r\nthey had brought on the toboggan, and which was set up where the ancient\r\nstove of flat stones had tumbled into ruin. By candle-light the work of\r\n\"rechinking\" with moss progressed rapidly. Wabi was constantly bursting\r\ninto snatches of wild Indian song, Rod whistled until his throat was\r\nsore and Mukoki chuckled and grunted and talked with constantly\r\nincreasing volubility. A score of times they congratulated one another\r\nupon their good luck. Eight wolf-scalps, a fine lynx and nearly two\r\nhundred dollars in gold--all within their first week! It was enough to\r\nfill them with enthusiasm and they made little effort to repress their\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nDuring this evening Mukoki boiled up a large pot of caribou fat and\r\nbones, and when Rod asked what kind of soup he was making he responded\r\nby picking up a handful of steel traps and dropping them into the\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n\"Make traps smell good for fox--wolf--fisher, an' marten, too; heem\r\ncome--all come--like smell,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't dip the traps,\" added Wabi, \"nine fur animals out of ten,\r\nand wolves most of all, will fight shy of the bait. They can smell the\r\nhuman odor you leave on the steel when you handle it. But the grease\r\n'draws' them.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the hunters wrapped themselves in their blankets that night their\r\nwilderness home was complete. All that remained to be done was the\r\nbuilding of three bunks against the ends of the cabin, and this work it\r\nwas agreed could be accomplished at odd hours by any one who happened to\r\nbe in camp. In the morning, laden with traps, they would strike out\r\ntheir first hunting-trails, keeping their eyes especially open for signs\r\nof wolves; for Mukoki was the greatest wolf hunter in all the Hudson Bay\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHOW WOLF BECAME THE COMPANION OF MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nTwice that night Rod was awakened by Mukoki opening the cabin door. The\r\nsecond time he raised himself upon his elbows and quietly watched the\r\nold warrior. It was a brilliantly clear night and a flood of moonlight\r\nwas pouring into the camp. He could hear Mukoki chuckling and grunting,\r\nas though communicating with himself, and at last, his curiosity getting\r\nthe better of him, he wrapped his blanket about him and joined the\r\nIndian at the door.\r\n\r\nMukoki was peering up into space. Rod followed his gaze. The moon was\r\ndirectly above the cabin. The sky was clear of clouds and so bright was\r\nthe light that objects on the farther side of the lake were plainly\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nBesides, it was bitter cold--so cold that his face began to tingle as he\r\nstood there. These things he noticed, but he could see nothing to hold\r\nMukoki's vision in the sky above unless it was the glorious beauty of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mukoki?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe old Indian looked silently at him for a moment, some mysterious,\r\nall-absorbing joy revealed in every lineament of his face.\r\n\r\n\"Wolf night!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nHe looked back to where Wabi was sleeping.\r\n\r\n\"Wolf night!\" he repeated, and slipped like a shadow to the side of the\r\nunconscious young hunter. Rod regarded his actions with growing wonder.\r\nHe saw him bend over Wabi, shake him by the shoulders, and heard him\r\nrepeat again, \"Wolf night! Wolf night!\"\r\n\r\nWabi awoke and sat up in his blankets, and Mukoki came back to the door.\r\nHe had dressed himself before this, and now, with his rifle, slipped out\r\ninto the night. The young Indian had joined Rod at the open door and\r\ntogether they watched Mukoki's gaunt figure as it sped swiftly across\r\nthe lake, up the hill and over into the wilderness desolation beyond.\r\n\r\nWhen Rod looked at Wabi he saw that the Indian boy's eyes were wide and\r\nstaring, with an expression in them that was something between fright\r\nand horror. Without speaking he went to the table and lighted the\r\ncandles and then dressed. When he was done his face still bore traces of\r\nsuppressed excitement.\r\n\r\nHe ran back to the door and whistled loudly. From his shelter beside the\r\ncabin the captive wolf responded with a snarling whine. Again he\r\nwhistled, a dozen times, twenty, but there came no reply. More swiftly\r\nthan Mukoki the Indian youth sped across the lake and to the summit of\r\nthe hill. Mukoki had completely disappeared in the white, brilliant\r\nvastness of the wilderness that stretched away at his feet.\r\n\r\nWhen Wabi returned to the cabin Rod had a fire roaring in the stove. He\r\nseated himself beside it, holding out a pair of hands blue with cold.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! It's an awful night!\" he shivered.\r\n\r\nHe laughed across at Rod, a little uneasily, but with the old light back\r\nin his eyes. Suddenly he asked:\r\n\r\n\"Did Minnetaki ever tell you--anything--queer--about Mukoki, Rod?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than you have told me yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, once in a great while Mukoki has--not exactly a fit, but a little\r\nmad spell! I have never determined to my own satisfaction whether he is\r\nreally out of his head or not. Sometimes I think he is and sometimes I\r\nthink he is not. But the Indians at the Post believe that at certain\r\ntimes he goes crazy over wolves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wolves!\" exclaimed Rod.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, wolves. And he has good reason. A good many years ago, just about\r\nwhen you and I were born, Mukoki had a wife and child. My mother and\r\nothers at the Post say that he was especially gone over the kid. He\r\nwouldn't hunt like other Indians, but would spend whole days at his\r\nshack playing with it and teaching it to do things; and when he did go\r\nhunting he would often tote it on his back, even when it wasn't much\r\nmore than a squalling papoose. He was the happiest Indian at the Post,\r\nand one of the poorest. One day Mukoki came to the Post with a little\r\nbundle of fur, and most of the things he got in exchange for it, mother\r\nsays, were for the kid. He reached the store at night and expected to\r\nleave for home the next noon, which would bring him to his camp before\r\ndark. But something delayed him and he didn't get started until the\r\nmorning after. Meanwhile, late in the afternoon of the day when he was\r\nto have been home, his wife bundled up the kid and they set out to meet\r\nhim. Well--\"\r\n\r\nA weird howl from the captive wolf interrupted Wabi for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they went on and on, and of course did not meet him. And then,\r\nthe people at the Post say, the mother must have slipped and hurt\r\nherself. Anyway, when Mukoki came over the trail the next day he found\r\nthem half eaten by wolves. From that day on Mukoki was a different\r\nIndian. He became the greatest wolf hunter in all these regions. Soon\r\nafter the tragedy he came to the Post to live and since then he has not\r\nleft Minnetaki and me. Once in a great while when the night is just\r\nright, when the moon is shining and it is bitter cold, Mukoki seems to\r\ngo a little mad. He calls this a 'wolf night.' No one can stop him from\r\ngoing out; no one can get him to talk; he will allow no one to accompany\r\nhim when in such a mood. He will walk miles and miles to-night. But he\r\nwill come back. And when he returns he will be as sane as you and I, and\r\nif you ask him where he has been he will say that he went out to see if\r\nhe could get a shot at something.\"\r\n\r\nRod had listened in rapt attention. To him, as Wabi proceeded with his\r\nstory of the tragedy in Mukoki's life, the old Indian was transformed\r\ninto another being. No longer was he a mere savage reclaimed a little\r\nfrom the wilderness. There had sprung up in Rod's breast a great, human,\r\nthrobbing sympathy for him, and in the dim candle-glow his eyes\r\nglistened with a dampness which he made no attempt to conceal.\r\n\r\n\"What does Mukoki mean by 'wolf night'?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Muky is a wizard when it comes to hunting wolves,\" Wabi went on. \"He\r\nhas studied them and thought of them every day of his life for nearly\r\ntwenty years. He knows more about wolves than all the rest of the\r\nhunters in this country together. He can catch them in every trap he\r\nsets, which no other trapper in the world can do; he can tell you a\r\nhundred different things about a certain wolf simply by its track, and\r\nbecause of his wonderful knowledge he can tell, by some instinct that is\r\nalmost supernatural, when a 'wolf night' comes. Something in the air\r\nto-night, something in the sky--in the moon--in the very way the\r\nwilderness looks, tells him that stray wolves in the plains and hills\r\nare 'packing' or banding together to-night, and that in the morning the\r\nsun will be shining, and they will be on the sunny sides of the\r\nmountains. See if I am not right. To-morrow night, if Mukoki comes back\r\nby then, we shall have some exciting sport with the wolves, and then you\r\nwill see how Wolf out there does his work!\"\r\n\r\nThere followed several minutes of silence. The fire roared up the\r\nchimney, the stove glowed red hot and the boys sat and looked and\r\nlistened. Rod took out his watch. It lacked only ten minutes of\r\nmidnight. Yet neither seemed possessed with a desire to return to their\r\ninterrupted sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Wolf is a curious beast,\" mused Wabi softly. \"You might think he was a\r\nsneaking, traitorous cur of a wolf to turn against his own breed and\r\nlure them to death. But he isn't. Wolf, as well as Mukoki, has good\r\ncause for what he does. You might call it animal vengeance. Did you ever\r\nnotice that a half of one of his ears is gone? And if you thrust back\r\nhis head you will find a terrible sear in his throat, and from his left\r\nside just back of the fore leg a chunk of flesh half as big as my hand\r\nhas been torn away. We caught Wolf in a lynx trap, Mukoki and I. He\r\nwasn't much more than a whelp then--about six months old, Mukoki said.\r\nAnd while he was in the trap, helpless and unable to defend himself,\r\nthree or four of his lovely tribe jumped upon him and tried to kill him\r\nfor breakfast. We hove in sight just in time to drive the cannibals off.\r\nWe kept Wolf, sewed up his side and throat, tamed him--and to-morrow\r\nnight you will see how Mukoki has taught him to get even with his\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nIt was two hours later when Rod and Wabigoon extinguished the candles\r\nand returned to their blankets. And for another hour after that the\r\nformer found it impossible to sleep. He wondered where Mukoki\r\nwas--wondered what he was doing, and how in his strange madness he found\r\nhis way in the trackless wilderness.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally fell asleep it was to dream of the Indian mother and her\r\nchild; only after a little there was no child, and the woman changed\r\ninto Minnetaki, and the ravenous wolves into men. From this unpleasant\r\npicture he was aroused by a series of prods in his side, and opening his\r\neyes he beheld Wabi in his blankets a yard away, pointing over and\r\nbeyond him and nodding his head. Rod looked, and caught his breath.\r\n\r\nThere was Mukoki--peeling potatoes!\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Muky!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe old Indian looked up with a grin. His face bore no signs of his mad\r\nnight on the trail. He nodded cheerfully and proceeded with the\r\npreparation of breakfast as though he had just risen from his blankets\r\nafter a long night's rest.\r\n\r\n\"Better get up,\" he advised. \"Big day's hunt. Much fine sunshine to-day.\r\nFind wolves on mountain--plenty wolves!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys tumbled from their blankets and began dressing.\r\n\r\n\"What time did you get in?\" asked Wabi.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" replied Mukoki, pointing to the hot stove and the peeled\r\npotatoes. \"Just make fire good.\"\r\n\r\nWabi gave Rod a suggestive look as the old Indian bent over the stove.\r\n\r\n\"What were you doing last night?\" he questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Big moon--might get shot,\" grunted Mukoki. \"See lynx on hill. See\r\nwolf-tracks on red deer trail. No shot.\"\r\n\r\nThis was as much of the history of Mukoki's night on the trail as the\r\nboys could secure, but during their breakfast Wabi shot another glance\r\nat Rod, and as Mukoki left the table for a moment to close the damper in\r\nthe stove he found an opportunity to whisper:\r\n\r\n\"See if I'm not right. He will choose the mountain trail.\" When their\r\ncompanion returned, he said: \"We had better split up this morning,\r\nhadn't we, Muky? It looks to me as though there are two mighty good\r\nlines for traps--one over the hill, where that creek leads off through\r\nthe range of ridges to the east, and the other along the creek which\r\nruns through the hilly plains to the north. What do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good\" agreed the old hunter. \"You two go north--I take ridges.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you and I will take the ridges and Wabi will go north alone,\"\r\namended Rod quickly. \"I'm going with you, Mukoki!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki, who was somewhat flattered by this preference of the white\r\nyouth, grinned and chuckled and began to talk more volubly about the\r\nplans which were in his head. It was agreed that they all would return\r\nto the cabin at an early hour in the afternoon, for the old Indian\r\nseemed positive that they would have their first wolf hunt that night.\r\n\r\nRod noticed that the captive wolf received no breakfast that morning,\r\nand he easily guessed the reason.\r\n\r\nThe traps were now divided. Three different sizes had been brought from\r\nthe Post--fifty small ones for mink, marten and other small fur animals;\r\nfifteen fox traps, and as many larger ones for lynx and wolves. Wabi\r\nequipped himself with twenty of the small traps and four each of fox and\r\nlynx traps, while Rod and Mukoki took about forty in all. The remainder\r\nof the caribou meat was then cut into chunks and divided equally among\r\nthem for bait.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just beginning to show itself above the wilderness when the\r\nhunters left camp. As Mukoki had predicted, it was a glorious day, one\r\nof those bitterly cold, cloudless days when, as the Indians believe, the\r\ngreat Creator robs the rest of the world of the sun that it may shine in\r\nall its glory upon their own savage land. From the top of the hill that\r\nsheltered their home Rod looked out over the glistening forests and\r\nlakes in rapt and speechless admiration; but only for a few moments did\r\nthe three pause, then took up their different trails.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of this hill Mukoki and his companion struck the creek. They\r\nhad not progressed more than fifty rods when the old Indian stopped and\r\npointed at a fallen log which spanned the stream. The snow on this log\r\nwas beaten by tiny footprints. Mukoki gazed a moment, cast an observant\r\neye along the trail, and at once threw off his pack.\r\n\r\n\"Mink!\" he explained. He crossed the frozen creek, taking care not to\r\ntouch the log. On the opposite side the tracks spread out over a\r\nwindfall of trees. \"Whole family mink live here,\" continued Mukoki.\r\n\"T'ree--mebby four--mebby five. Build trap-house right here!\"\r\n\r\nNever before had Rod seen a trap set as the old Indian now set his. Very\r\nnear the end of the log over which the mink made their trail he quickly\r\nbuilt a shelter of sticks which when completed was in the form of a tiny\r\nwigwam. At the back of this was placed a chunk of the caribou meat, and\r\nin front of this bait, so that an animal would have to spring it in\r\npassing, was set a trap, carefully covered with snow and a few leaves.\r\nWithin twenty minutes Mukoki had built two of these shelters and had set\r\ntwo traps.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you build those little houses?\" asked Rod, as they again took up\r\ntheir trail.\r\n\r\n\"Much snow come in winter,\" elucidated the Indian. \"Build house to keep\r\nsnow off traps. No do that, be digging out traps all winter. When\r\nmink--heem smell meat--go in house he got to go over trap. Make house\r\nfor all small animal like heem. No good for lynx. He see house--walk\r\nroun' 'n' roun' 'n' roun'--and then go 'way. Smart fellow--lynx. Wolf\r\nand fox, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is a mink worth much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fi' dollar--no less that. Seven--eight dollar for good one.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next mile six other mink traps were set. The creek now ran\r\nalong the edge of a high rocky ridge and Mukoki's eyes began to shine\r\nwith a new interest. No longer did he seem entirely absorbed in the\r\ndiscovery of signs of fur animals. His eyes were constantly scanning the\r\nsun-bathed side of the ridge ahead and his progress was slow and\r\ncautious. He spoke in whispers, and Rod followed his example. Frequently\r\nthe two would stop and scan the openings for signs of life. Twice they\r\nset fox traps where there were evident signs of runways; in a wild\r\nravine, strewn with tumbled trees and masses of rock, they struck a lynx\r\ntrack and set a trap for him at each end of the ravine; but even during\r\nthese operations Mukoki's interest was divided. The hunters now walked\r\nabreast, about fifty yards apart, Rod never forging a foot ahead of the\r\ncautious Mukoki. Suddenly the youth heard a low call and he saw his\r\ncompanion beckoning to him with frantic enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Wolf!\" whispered Mukoki as Rod joined him.\r\n\r\nIn the snow were a number of tracks that reminded Rod of those made by a\r\ndog.\r\n\r\n\"T'ree wolf!\" continued the Indian jubilantly. \"Travel early this\r\nmorning. Somewhere in warm sun on mountain!\"\r\n\r\nThey followed now in the wolf trail. A little way on Rod found part of\r\nthe carcass of a rabbit with fox tracks about it. Here Mukoki set\r\nanother trap. A little farther still they came across a fisher trail and\r\nanother trap was laid. Caribou and deer tracks crossed and recrossed the\r\ncreek, but the Indian paid little attention to them. A fourth wolf\r\njoined the pack, and a fifth, and half an hour later the trail of three\r\nother wolves cut at right angles across the one they were following and\r\ndisappeared in the direction of the thickly timbered plains. Mukoki's\r\nface was crinkled with joy.\r\n\r\n\"Many wolf near,\" he exclaimed. \"Many wolf off there 'n' off there 'n'\r\noff there. Good place for night hunt.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the creek swung out from the ridge and cut a circuitous channel\r\nthrough a small swamp. Here there were signs of wild life which set\r\nRod's heart thumping and his blood tingling with excitement. In places\r\nthe snow was literally packed with deer tracks. Trails ran in every\r\ndirection, the bark had been rubbed from scores of saplings, and every\r\nstep gave fresh evidence of the near presence of game. The stealth with\r\nwhich Mukoki now advanced was almost painful. Every twig was pressed\r\nbehind him noiselessly, and once when Rod struck his snow-shoe against\r\nthe butt of a small tree the old Indian held up his hands in mock\r\nhorror. Ten minutes, fifteen--twenty of them passed in this cautious,\r\nbreathless trailing of the swamp.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mukoki stopped, and a hand was held out behind him warningly.\r\nHe turned his face back, and Rod knew that he saw game. Inch by inch he\r\ncrouched upon his snow-shoes, and beckoned for Rod to approach, slowly,\r\nquietly. When the boy had come near enough he passed back his rifle, and\r\nhis lips formed the almost noiseless word, \"Shoot!\"\r\n\r\nTremblingly Rod seized the gun and looked into the swamp ahead, Mukoki\r\ndoubling down in front of him. What he saw sent him for a moment into\r\nthe first nervous tremor of buck fever. Not more than a hundred yards\r\naway stood a magnificent buck browsing the tips of a clump of hazel, and\r\njust beyond him were two does. With a powerful effort Rod steadied\r\nhimself. The buck was standing broadside, his head and neck stretched\r\nup, offering a beautiful shot at the vital spot behind his fore leg. At\r\nthis the young hunter aimed and fired. With one spasmodic bound the\r\nanimal dropped dead.\r\n\r\nHardly had Rod seen the effect of his shot before Mukoki was traveling\r\nswiftly toward the fallen game, unstrapping his pack as he ran. By the\r\ntime the youth reached his quarry the old Indian had produced a large\r\nwhisky flask holding about a quart. Without explanation he now proceeded\r\nto thrust his knife into the quivering animal's throat and fill this\r\nflask with blood. When he had finished his task he held it up with an\r\nair of unbounded satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Blood for wolf. Heem like blood. Smell um--come make big shoot\r\nto-night. No blood, no bait--no wolf shoot!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki no longer maintained his usual quiet, and it was evident to Rod\r\nthat the Indian considered his mission for that day practically\r\naccomplished. After taking the heart, liver and one of the hind quarters\r\nof the buck Mukoki drew a long rope of babeesh from his pack, tied one\r\nend of it around the animal's neck, flung the other end over a near\r\nlimb, and with his companion's assistance hoisted the carcass until it\r\nwas clear of the ground.\r\n\r\n\"If somethin' happen we no come back to-night heem safe from wolf,\" he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThe two now continued through the swamp. At its farther edge the ground\r\nrose gently from the creek toward the hills, and this sloping plain was\r\ncovered with huge boulders and a thin growth of large spruce and birch.\r\nJust beyond the creek was a gigantic rock which immediately caught\r\nMukoki's attention. All sides except one were too precipitous for\r\nascent, and even this one could not be climbed without the assistance of\r\na sapling or two. They could see, however, that the top of the, rock was\r\nflat, and Mukoki called attention to this fact with an exultant chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"Fine place for wolf hunt!\" he exclaimed. \"Many wolf off there in swamp\r\nan' in hill. We call heem here. Shoot from there!\" He pointed to a clump\r\nof spruce a dozen rods away.\r\n\r\nBy Rod's watch it was now nearly noon and the two sat down to eat the\r\nsandwiches they had brought with them. Only a few minutes were lost in\r\ntaking up the home trail. Beyond the swamp Mukoki cut at right angles to\r\ntheir trap-line until he had ascended to the top of the ridge that had\r\nbeen on their right and which would take them very near their camp. From\r\nthis ridge Rod could look about him upon a wild and rugged scene. On one\r\nside it sloped down to the plains, but on the other it fell in almost\r\nsheer walls, forming at its base five hundred feet below a narrow and\r\ngloomy chasm, through which a small stream found its way. Several times\r\nMukoki stopped and leaned perilously close to the dizzy edge of the\r\nmountain, peering down with critical eyes, and once when he pulled\r\nhimself back cautiously by means of a small sapling he explained his\r\ninterest by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Plenty bear there in spring!\"\r\n\r\nBut Rod was not thinking of bears. Once more his head was filled with\r\nthe thought of gold. Perhaps that very chasm held the priceless secret\r\nthat had died with its owners half a century ago. The dark and gloomy\r\nsilence that hung between those two walls of rock, the death-like\r\ndesolation, the stealthy windings of the creek--everything in that dim\r\nand mysterious world between the two mountains, unshattered by sound and\r\nimpenetrable to the winter sun, seemed in his mind to link itself with\r\nthe tragedy of long ago.\r\n\r\nDid that chasm hold the secret of the dead men?\r\n\r\nAgain and again Rod found himself asking this question as he followed\r\nMukoki, and the oftener he asked it the nearer he seemed to an answer,\r\nuntil at last, with a curious, thrilling certainty that set his blood\r\ntingling he caught Mukoki by the arm and pointing back, said:\r\n\r\n\"Mukoki--the gold was found between those mountains!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWOLF TAKES VENGEANCE UPON HIS PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that hour was born in Roderick Drew's breast a strange,\r\nimperishable desire. Willingly at this moment would he have given up the\r\nwinter trapping to have pursued that golden _ignis fatuus_ of all\r\nages--the lure of gold. To him the story of the old cabin, the skeletons\r\nand the treasure of the buckskin bag was complete. Those skeletons had\r\nonce been men. They had found a mine--a place where they had picked up\r\nnuggets with their fingers. And that treasure ground was somewhere near.\r\nNo longer was he puzzled by the fact that they had discovered no more\r\ngold in the old log cabin. In a flash he had solved that mystery. The\r\nmen had just begun to gather their treasure when they had fought. What\r\nwas more logical than that? One day, two, three--and they had quarreled\r\nover division, over rights. That was the time when they were most likely\r\nto quarrel. Perhaps one had discovered the gold and had therefore\r\nclaimed a larger share. Anyway, the contents of the buckskin bag\r\nrepresented but a few days' labor. Rod was sure of that.\r\n\r\nMukoki had grinned and shrugged his shoulders with an air of stupendous\r\ndoubt when Rod had told him that the gold lay between the mountains, so\r\nnow the youth kept his thoughts to himself. It was a silent trail home.\r\nRod's mind was too active in its new channel, and he was too deeply\r\nabsorbed in impressing upon his memory certain landmarks which they\r\npassed to ask questions; and Mukoki, with the natural taciturnity of his\r\nrace, seldom found occasion to break into conversation unless spoken to\r\nfirst. Although his eyes were constantly on the alert, Rod could see no\r\nway in which a descent could be made into the chasm from the ridge they\r\nwere on. This was a little disappointing, for he had made up his mind to\r\nexplore the gloomy, sunless gulch at his first opportunity. He had no\r\ndoubt that Wabi would join in the adventure. Or he might take his own\r\ntime, and explore it alone. He was reasonably sure that from somewhere\r\non the opposite ridge a descent could be made into it.\r\n\r\nWabi was in camp when they arrived. He had set eighteen traps and had\r\nshot two spruce partridges. The birds were already cleaned for their\r\nearly supper, and a thick slice of venison steak was added to the menu.\r\nDuring the preparation of the meal Rod described their discovery of the\r\nchasm and revealed some of his thoughts concerning it, but Wabi betrayed\r\nonly passing flashes of interest. At times he seemed strangely\r\npreoccupied and would stand in an idle, contemplative mood, his hands\r\nburied deep in his pockets, while Rod or Mukoki proceeded with the\r\nlittle duties about the table or the stove. Finally, after arousing\r\nhimself from one of these momentary spells, he pulled a brass shell from\r\nhis pocket and held it out to the old Indian.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" he said. \"I don't want to stir up any false fears, or\r\nanything of that sort--but I found that on the trail to-day!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki clutched at the shell as though it had been another newly found\r\nnugget of gold. The shell was empty. The lettering on the rim was still\r\nvery distinct. He read \".35 Rem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's--\"\r\n\r\n\"A shell from Rod's gun!\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Rod and Mukoki stared at the young Indian in blank\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\"It's a .35 caliber Remington,\" continued Wabi, \"and it's an auto-loading\r\nshell. There are only three guns like that in this country. I've got\r\none, Mukoki has another--and you lost the third in your fight with the\r\nWoongas!\"\r\n\r\nThe venison had begun to burn, and Mukoki quickly transferred it to the\r\ntable. Without a word the three sat down to their meal.\r\n\r\n\"That means the Woongas are on our trail,\" declared Rod presently.\r\n\r\n\"That is what I have been trying to reason out all the afternoon,\"\r\nreplied Wabi. \"It certainly is proof that they are, or have been quite\r\nrecently, on this side of the mountain. But I don't believe they know we\r\nare here. The trail I struck was about five miles from camp. It was at\r\nleast two days old. Three Indians on snow-shoes were traveling north. I\r\nfollowed back on their trail and found after a time that the Indians had\r\ncome from the north, which leads me to believe that they were simply on\r\na hunting expedition, cut a circle southward, and then returned to their\r\ncamp. I don't believe they will come farther south. But we must keep our\r\neyes open.\"\r\n\r\nWabi's description of the manner in which the strange trail turned gave\r\ngreat satisfaction to Mukoki, who nodded affirmatively when the young\r\nhunter expressed it as his belief that the Woongas would not come so far\r\nas their camp. But the discovery of their presence chilled the buoyant\r\nspirits of the hunters. There was, however, a new spice of adventure\r\nlurking in this possible peril that was not altogether displeasing, and\r\nby the time the meal was at an end something like a plan of campaign had\r\nbeen formed. The hunters would not wait to be attacked and then act in\r\nself-defense, possibly at a disadvantage. They would be constantly on\r\nthe lookout for the Woongas, and if a fresh trail or a camp was found\r\nthey would begin the man-hunt themselves.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just beginning to sink behind the distant hills in the\r\nsouthwest when the hunters again left camp. Wolf had received nothing to\r\neat since the previous night, and with increasing hunger the fiery\r\nimpatience lurking in his eyes and the restlessness of his movements\r\nbecame more noticeable. Mukoki called attention to these symptoms with a\r\ngloating satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe gloom of early evening was enveloping the wilderness by the time the\r\nthree wolf hunters reached the swamp in which Rod had slain the buck.\r\nWhile he carried the guns and packs, Mukoki and Wabigoon dragged the\r\nbuck between them to the huge flat-top rock. Now for the first time the\r\ncity youth began to understand the old pathfinder's scheme. Several\r\nsaplings were cut, and by means of a long rope of babeesh the deer was\r\ndragged up the side of the rock until it rested securely upon the flat\r\nspace. From the dead buck's neck the babeesh rope was now stretched\r\nacross the intervening space between the rock and the clump of cedars in\r\nwhich the hunters were to conceal themselves. In two of these cedars, at\r\na distance of a dozen feet from the ground, were quickly made three\r\nplatforms of saplings, upon which the ambushed watchers could\r\ncomfortably seat themselves. By the time complete darkness had fallen\r\nthe \"trap\" was finished, with the exception of a detail which Rod\r\nfollowed with great interest.\r\n\r\nFrom inside his clothes, where it had been kept warm by his body, Mukoki\r\nproduced the flask of blood. A third of this blood he scattered upon the\r\nface of the rock and upon the snow at its base. The remainder he\r\ndistributed, drop by drop, in trails running toward the swamp and\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nThere still remained three hours before the moon would be up, and the\r\nhunters now joined Wolf, who had been fastened half-way up the ridge. In\r\nthe shelter of a big rock a small fire was built, and during their long\r\nwait the hunters passed the time away by broiling and eating chunks of\r\nvenison and in going over again the events of the day.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o'clock before the moon rose above the edge of the\r\nwilderness. This great orb of the Northern night seemed to hold a\r\nnever-ending fascination for Rod. It crept above the forests, a glowing,\r\nthrobbing ball of red, quivering and palpitating in an effulgence that\r\nneither cloud nor mist dimmed in this desolation beyond the sphere of\r\nman; and as it rose, almost with visible movement to the eyes, the blood\r\nin it faded, until at last it seemed a great blaze of soft light between\r\nsilver and gold. It was then that the whole world was lighted up under\r\nit. It was then that Mukoki, speaking softly, beckoned the others to\r\nfollow him, and with Wolf at his side went down the ridge.\r\n\r\nMaking a circuit around the back of the rock, Mukoki paused near a small\r\nsapling twenty yards from the dead buck and secured Wolf by his babeesh\r\nthong. Hardly had he done so when the animal began to exhibit signs of\r\nexcitement. He trotted about nervously, sniffing the air, gathering the\r\nwind from every direction, and his jaws dropped with a snarling whine.\r\nThen he struck one of the clots of blood in the snow.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" whispered Wabi, pulling at Rod's sleeve, \"come--quietly.\"\r\n\r\nThey slipped back among the shadows of the spruce and watched Wolf in\r\nunbroken silence. The animal now stood rigidly over the blood clot. His\r\nhead was level with his quivering back, his ears half aslant, his\r\nnostrils pointing to a strange thrilling scent that came to him from\r\nsomewhere out there in the moonlight. Once more the instinct of his\r\nbreed was flooding the soul of the captive wolf. There was the odor of\r\nblood in his widening nostrils. It was not the blood of the camp, of the\r\nslaughtered game dragged in by human hands before his eyes. It was the\r\nblood of the chase!\r\n\r\nA flashing memory of his captors turned the animal's head for an instant\r\nin backward inspection. They were gone. He could neither hear nor see\r\nthem. He sniffed the sign of human presence, but that sign was always\r\nwith him, and was not disturbing. The blood held him--and the strange\r\nscent, the game scent--that was coming to him more clearly every\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nHe crunched about cautiously in the snow. He found other spots of blood,\r\nand to the watchers there came a low long whine that seemed about to end\r\nin the wolf song. The blood trails were leading him away toward the game\r\nscent, and he tugged viciously at the babeesh that held him captive,\r\ngnawing at it vainly, like an angry dog, forgetting what experience had\r\ntaught him many times before. Each moment added to his excitement He ran\r\nabout the sapling, gulped mouthfuls of the bloody snow, and each time he\r\npaused for a moment with his open dripping jaws held toward the dead\r\nbuck on the rock. The game was very near. Brute sense told him that. Oh,\r\nthe longing that was in him, the twitching, quivering longing to\r\nkill--kill--kill!\r\n\r\nHe made another effort, tore up the snow in his frantic endeavors to\r\nfree himself, to break loose, to follow in the wild glad cry of freed\r\nsavagery in the calling of his people. He failed again, panting, whining\r\nin piteous helplessness.\r\n\r\nThen he settled upon his haunches at the end of his babeesh thong.\r\n\r\nFor a moment his head turned to the moonlit sky, his long nose poised at\r\nright angles to the bristling hollows between his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThere came then a low, whining wail, like the beginning of the\r\n\"death-song\" of a husky dog--a wail that grew in length and in strength\r\nand in volume until it rose weirdly among the mountains and swept far\r\nout over the plains--the hunt call of the wolf on the trail, which calls\r\nto him the famished, gray-gaunt outlaws of the wilderness, as the\r\nbugler's notes call his fellows on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThree times that blood-thrilling cry went up from the captive wolf's\r\nthroat, and before those cries had died away the three hunters were\r\nperched upon their platforms among the spruce.\r\n\r\nThere followed now the ominous, waiting silence of an awakened\r\nwilderness. Rod could hear his heart throbbing within him. He forgot the\r\nintense cold. His nerves tingled. He looked out over the endless plains,\r\nwhite and mysteriously beautiful as they lay bathed in the glow of the\r\nmoon. And Wabi knew more than he what was happening. All over that wild\r\ndesolation the call of the wolf had carried its meaning. Down there,\r\nwhere a lake lay silent in its winter sleep, a doe started in trembling\r\nand fear; beyond the mountain a huge bull moose lifted his antlered head\r\nwith battle-glaring eyes; half a mile away a fox paused for an instant\r\nin its sleuth-like stalking of a rabbit; and here and there in that\r\nworld of wild things the gaunt hungry people of Wolf's blood stopped in\r\ntheir trails and turned their heads toward the signal that was coming in\r\nwailing echoes to their ears.\r\n\r\nAnd then the silence was broken. From afar--it might have been a mile\r\naway--there came an answering cry; and at that cry the wolf at the end\r\nof his babeesh thong settled upon his haunches again and sent back the\r\ncall that comes only when there is blood upon the trail or when near the\r\nkilling time.\r\n\r\nThere was not the rustle of a bough, not a word spoken, by the silent\r\nwatchers in the spruce. Mukoki had slipped back and half lay across his\r\nsupport in shooting attitude. Wabi had braced a foot, and his rifle was\r\nhalf to his shoulder, leveled over a knee. It was Rod's turn with the\r\nbig revolver, and he had practised aiming through a crotch that gave a\r\nrest to his arm.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments there came again the howl of the distant wolf on the\r\nplains, and this time it was joined by another away to the westward. And\r\nafter that there came two from the plains instead of one, and then a far\r\ncry to the north and east. For the first time Rod and Wabi heard the\r\ngloating chuckle of Mukoki in his spruce a dozen feet away.\r\n\r\nAt the increasing responses of his brethren Wolf became more frantic in\r\nhis efforts. The scent of fresh blood and of wounded game was becoming\r\nmaddening to the captive. But his frenzy no longer betrayed itself in\r\nfutile efforts to escape from the babeesh thong. Wolf knew that his\r\ncries were assembling the hunt-pack. Nearer and nearer came the\r\nresponses of the leaders, and there were now only momentary rests\r\nbetween the deep-throated exhortations which he sent in all directions\r\ninto the night.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, almost from the swamp itself, there came a quick, excited,\r\nyelping reply, and Wabi gripped Rod by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"He has struck the place where you killed the buck,\" he whispered.\r\n\"There'll be quick work now!\"\r\n\r\nHardly had he spoken when a series of excited howls broke forth from the\r\nswamp, coming nearer and nearer as the hunger-crazed outlaw of the\r\nplains followed over the rich-scented trail made by the two Indians as\r\nthey carried the slaughtered deer. Soon he nosed one of the trails of\r\nblood, and a moment later the watchers saw a gaunt shadow form running\r\nswiftly over the snow toward Wolf.\r\n\r\nFor an instant, as the two beasts of prey met, there fell a silence;\r\nthen both animals joined in the wailing hunt-pack cry, and the wolf that\r\nwas free came to the edge of the great rock and stood with his fore feet\r\non its side, and his cry changed from that of the chase to the still\r\nmore thrilling signal that told the gathering pack of game at bay.\r\n\r\nSwiftly the wolves closed in. From over the edge of the mountain one\r\ncame and joined the wolf at the rock without the hunters seeing his\r\napproach. From out of the swamp there came a pack of three, and now\r\nabout the rock there grew a maddened, yelping horde, clambering and\r\nscrambling and fighting in their efforts to climb up to the game that\r\nwas so near and yet beyond their reach. And sixty feet away Wolf\r\ncrouched, watching the gathering of his clan, helpless, panting from his\r\nchoking efforts to free himself, and quieting, gradually quieting, until\r\nin sullen silence he looked upon the scene, as though he knew the moment\r\nwas very near when that thrilling spectacle would be changed into a\r\nscene of direst tragedy.\r\n\r\nAnd it was Mukoki who had first said that this was the vengeance of Wolf\r\nupon his people.\r\n\r\nFrom Mukoki there now came a faint hissing warning, and Wabi threw his\r\nrifle to his shoulder. There were at least a score of wolves at the base\r\nof the rock. Gradually the old Indian pulled upon the babeesh rope that\r\nled to the dead buck--pulled until he was putting a half of his strength\r\ninto the effort, and could feel the animal slowly slipping from the flat\r\nledge. A moment more and the buck tumbled down in the midst of the\r\nwaiting pack.\r\n\r\nAs flies gather upon a lump of sugar the famished animals now crowded\r\nand crushed and fought over the deer's body, and as they came thus\r\ntogether there sounded the quick sharp signal to fire from Mukoki.\r\n\r\nFor five seconds the edge of the spruce was a blaze of death-dealing\r\nflashes, and the deafening reports of the two rifles and the big Colt\r\ndrowned the cries and struggles of the animals. When those five seconds\r\nwere over fifteen shots had been fired, and five seconds later the vast,\r\nbeautiful silence of the wilderness night had fallen again. About the\r\nrock was the silence of death, broken only faintly by the last gasping\r\nthroes of the animals that lay dying in the snow.\r\n\r\nIn the trees there sounded the metallic clink of loading shells.\r\n\r\nWabi spoke first.\r\n\r\n\"I believe we did a good job, Mukoki!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki's reply was to slip down his tree. The others followed, and\r\nhastened across to the rock. Five bodies lay motionless in the snow. A\r\nsixth was dragging himself around the side of the rock, and Mukoki\r\nattacked it with his belt-ax. Still a seventh had run for a dozen rods,\r\nleaving a crimson trail behind, and when Wabi and Rod came up to it the\r\nanimal was convulsed in its last dying struggles.\r\n\r\n\"Seven!\" exclaimed the Indian youth. \"That is one of the best shoots we\r\never had. A hundred and five dollars in a night isn't bad, is it?\"\r\n\r\nThe two came back to the rock, dragging the wolf with them. Mukoki was\r\nstanding as rigid as a statue in the moonlight, his face turned into the\r\nnorth. He pointed one arm far out over the plains, and said, without\r\nturning his head,\r\n\r\n\"See!\"\r\n\r\nFar out in that silent desolation the hunters saw a lurid flash of\r\nflame. It climbed up and up, until it filled the night above it with a\r\ndull glow--a single unbroken stream of fire that rose far above the\r\nswamps and forests of the plains.\r\n\r\n\"That's a burning jackpine!\" said Wabigoon.\r\n\r\n\"Burning jackpine!\" agreed the old warrior. Then he added, \"Woonga\r\nsignal fire!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRODERICK EXPLORES THE CHASM\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Rod the blazing pine seemed to be but a short distance away--a mile,\r\nperhaps a little more. In the silence of the two Indians as they\r\ncontemplated the strange fire he read an ominous meaning. In Mukoki's\r\neyes was a dull sullen glare, not unlike that which fills the orbs of a\r\nwild beast in a moment of deadly anger. Wabi's face was filled with an\r\neager flush, and three times, Rod observed, he turned eyes strangely\r\nburning with some unnatural passion upon Mukoki.\r\n\r\nSlowly, even as the instincts of his race had aroused the latent,\r\nbrutish love of slaughter and the chase in the tamed wolf, the long\r\nsmothered instincts of these human children of the forest began to\r\nbetray themselves in their bronzed countenances. Rod watched, and he was\r\nthrilled to the soul. Back at the old cabin they had declared war upon\r\nthe Woongas. Both Mukoki and Wabigoon had slipped the leashes that had\r\nlong restrained them from meting first vengeance upon their enemies. Now\r\nthe opportunity had come. For five minutes the great pine blazed, and\r\nthen died away until it was only a smoldering tower of light. Still\r\nMukoki gazed, speechless and grim, out into the distance of the night.\r\nAt last Wabi broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"How far away is it, Muky?\"\r\n\r\n\"T'ree mile,\" answered the old warrior without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"We could make it in forty minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nWabi turned to Rod.\r\n\r\n\"You can find your way back to camp alone, can't you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not if you're going over there!\" declared the white boy. \"I'm going\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\nMukoki broke in upon them with a harsh disappointed laugh.\r\n\r\n\"No go. No go over there.\" He spoke with emphasis, and shook his head.\r\n\"We lose pine in five minutes. No find Woonga camp--make big trail for\r\nWoongas to see in morning. Better wait. Follow um trail in day, then\r\nshoot!\"\r\n\r\nRod found immense relief in the old Indian's decision. He did not fear a\r\nfight; in fact, he was a little too anxious to meet the outlaws who had\r\nstolen his gun, now that they had determined upon opening fire on sight.\r\nBut in this instance he was possessed of the cooler judgment of his\r\nrace. He believed that as yet the Woongas were not aware of their\r\npresence in this region, and that there was still a large possibility of\r\nthe renegades traveling northward beyond their trapping sphere. He hoped\r\nthat this would be the case, in spite of his desire to recapture his\r\ngun. A scrimmage with the Woongas just now would spoil the plans he had\r\nmade for discovering gold.\r\n\r\nThe \"Skeleton Mine,\" as he had come to call it, now absorbed his\r\nthoughts beyond everything else. He felt confident that he would\r\ndiscover the lost treasure ground if given time, and he was just as\r\nconfident that if war was once begun between themselves and the Woongas\r\nit would mean disaster or quick flight from the country. Even Wabi,\r\nworked up more in battle enthusiasm than by gold fever, conceded that if\r\nhalf of the Woongas were in this country they were much too powerful for\r\nthem to cope with successfully, especially as one of them was without a\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore with inward exultation that Rod saw the project of\r\nattack dropped and Mukoki and Wabigoon proceed with their short task of\r\nscalping the seven wolves. During this operation Wolf was allowed to\r\nfeast upon the carcass of the buck.\r\n\r\nThat night there was but little sleep in the old cabin. It was two\r\no'clock when the hunters arrived in camp and from that hour until nearly\r\nfour they sat about the hot stove making plans for the day that was\r\nnearly at hand. Rod could but contrast the excitement that had now taken\r\npossession of them with the tranquil joy with which they had first taken\r\nup their abode in this dip in the hilltop. And how different were their\r\nplans from those of two or three days ago! Not one of them now but\r\nrealized their peril. They were in an ideal hunting range, but it was\r\nevidently very near, if not actually in, the Woonga country. At any\r\nmoment they might be forced to fight for their lives or abandon their\r\ncamp, and perhaps they would be compelled to do both.\r\n\r\nSo the gathering about the stove was in reality a small council of war.\r\nIt was decided that the old cabin should immediately be put into a\r\ncondition of defense, with a loophole on each side, strong new bars at\r\nthe door, and with a thick barricade near at hand that could be quickly\r\nfitted against the window in case of attack. Until the war-clouds\r\ncleared away, if they cleared at all, the camp would be continually\r\nguarded by one of the hunters, and with this garrison would be left both\r\nof the heavy revolvers. At dawn or a little later Mukoki would set out\r\nupon Wabi's trap-line, both to become acquainted with it and to extend\r\nthe line of traps, while later in the day the Indian youth would follow\r\nMukoki's line, visiting the houses already built and setting other\r\ntraps. This scheme left to Rod the first day's watch in camp.\r\n\r\nMukoki aroused himself from his short sleep with the first approach of\r\ndawn but did not awaken his tired companions until breakfast was ready.\r\nWhen the meal was finished he seized his gun and signified his intention\r\nof visiting the mink traps just beyond the hill before leaving on his\r\nlong day's trail. Rod at once joined him, leaving Wabi to wash the\r\ndishes.\r\n\r\nThey were shortly within view of the trap-houses near the creek.\r\nInstinctively the eyes of both rested upon these houses and neither gave\r\nvery close attention to the country ahead or about them. As a result\r\nboth were exceedingly startled when they heard a huge snort and a great\r\ncrunching in the deep snow close beside them. From out of a small growth\r\nof alders had dashed a big bull moose, who was now tearing with the\r\nspeed of a horse up the hillside toward the hidden camp, evidently\r\nseeking the quick shelter of the dip.\r\n\r\n\"Wait heem git top of hill!\" shouted Mukoki, swinging his rifle to his\r\nshoulder. \"Wait!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful shot and Rod was tempted to ignore the old Indian's\r\nadvice. But he knew that there was some good reason for it, so he held\r\nhis trembling finger. Hardly had the animal's huge antlered head risen\r\nto the sky-line when Mukoki shouted again, and the young hunter pressed\r\nthe trigger of his automatic gun three times in rapid succession. It was\r\na short shot, not more than two hundred yards, and Mukoki fired but once\r\njust as the bull mounted the hilltop.\r\n\r\nThe next instant the moose was gone and Rod was just about to dash in\r\npursuit when his companion caught him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"We got um!\" he grinned. \"He run downhill, then fall--ver' close to\r\ncamp. Ver' good scheme--wait heem git on top hill. No have to carry meat\r\nfar!\"\r\n\r\nAs coolly as though nothing had occurred the Indian turned again in the\r\ndirection of the traps. Rod stood as though he had been nailed to the\r\nspot, his mouth half open in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"We go see traps,\" urged Mukoki. \"Find moose dead when we go back.\"\r\n\r\nBut Roderick Drew, who had hunted nothing larger than house rats in his\r\nown city, was not the young man to see the logic of this reasoning, and\r\nbefore Mukoki could open his mouth again he was hurrying up the hill. On\r\nits summit he saw a huge torn-up blotch in the snow, spattered with\r\nblood, where the moose had fallen first after the shots; and at the foot\r\nof the hill, as the Indian had predicted, the great animal lay dead.\r\n\r\nWabi was hastening across the lake, attracted by the shots, and both\r\nreached the slain bull at about the same time. Rod quickly perceived\r\nthat three shots had taken effect; one, which was undoubtedly Mukoki's\r\ncarefully directed ball, in a vital spot behind the fore leg, and two\r\nthrough the body. The fact that two of his own shots had taken good\r\neffect filled the white youth with enthusiasm, and he was still\r\ngesticulating excitedly in describing the bull's flight to Wabi when the\r\nold Indian came over the hill, grinning broadly, and holding up for\r\ntheir inspection a magnificent mink.\r\n\r\nThe day could not have begun more auspiciously for the hunters, and by\r\nthe time Mukoki was ready to leave upon his long trail the adventurers\r\nwere in buoyant spirits, the distressing fears of the preceding night\r\nbeing somewhat dispelled by their present good fortune and the glorious\r\nday which now broke in full splendor upon the wilderness.\r\n\r\nUntil their early dinner Wabi remained in camp, securing certain parts\r\nof the moose and assisting Rod in putting the cabin into a state of\r\ndefense according to their previous plans. It was not yet noon when he\r\nstarted over Mukoki's trap-line.\r\n\r\nLeft to his own uninterrupted thoughts, Rod's mind was once more\r\nabsorbed in his scheme of exploring the mysterious chasm. He had noticed\r\nduring his inspection from the top of the ridge that the winter snows\r\nhad as yet fallen but little in the gloomy gulch between the mountains,\r\nand he was eager to attempt his adventure before other snows came or the\r\nfierce blizzards of December filled the chasm with drifts. Later in the\r\nafternoon he brought forth the buckskin bag from a niche in the log wall\r\nwhere it had been concealed, and one after another carefully examined\r\nthe golden nuggets. He found, as he had expected, that they were worn to\r\nexceeding smoothness, and that every edge had been dulled and rounded.\r\nRod's favorite study in school had been a minor branch of geology and\r\nmineralogy, and he knew that only running water could work this\r\nsmoothness. He was therefore confident that the nuggets had been\r\ndiscovered in or on the edge of a running stream. And that stream, he\r\nwas sure, was the one in the chasm.\r\n\r\nBut Rod's plans for an early investigation were doomed to\r\ndisappointment. Late that day both Mukoki and Wabi returned, the latter\r\nwith a red fox and another mink, the former with a fisher, which\r\nreminded Rod of a dog just growing out of puppyhood, and another story\r\nof strange trails that renewed their former apprehensions. The old\r\nIndian had discovered the remnants of the burned jackpine, and about it\r\nwere the snow-shoe tracks of three Indians. One of these trails came\r\nfrom the north and two from the west, which led him to believe that the\r\npine had been fired as a signal to call the two. At the very end of\r\ntheir trap-line, which extended about four miles from camp, a single\r\nsnow-shoe trail had cut across at right angles, also swinging into the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries necessitated a new arrangement of the plans that had\r\nbeen made the preceding night. Hereafter, it was agreed, only one\r\ntrap-line would be visited each day, and by two of the hunters in\r\ncompany, both armed with rifles. Rod saw that this meant the abandonment\r\nof his scheme for exploring the chasm, at least for the present.\r\n\r\nDay after day now passed without evidences of new trails, and each day\r\nadded to the hopes of the adventurers that they were at last to be left\r\nalone in the country. Never had Mukoki or Wabigoon been in a better\r\ntrapping ground, and every visit to their lines added to their hoard of\r\nfurs. If left unmolested it was plainly evident that they would take a\r\nsmall fortune back to Wabinosh House with them early in the spring.\r\nBesides many mink, several fisher, two red foxes and a lynx, they added\r\ntwo fine \"cross\" foxes and three wolf scalps to their treasure during\r\nthe next three weeks. Rod began to think occasionally of the joy their\r\nsuccess would bring to the little home hundreds of miles away, where he\r\nknew that the mother was waiting and praying for him every day of her\r\nlife; and there were times, too, when he found himself counting the days\r\nthat must still elapse before he returned to Minnetaki and the Post.\r\n\r\nBut at no time did he give up his determination to explore the chasm.\r\nFrom the first Mukoki and Wabigoon had regarded this project with little\r\nfavor, declaring the impossibility of discovering gold under snow, even\r\nthough gold was there; so Rod waited and watched for an opportunity to\r\nmake the search alone, saying nothing about his plans.\r\n\r\nOn a beautiful day late in December, when the sun rose with dazzling\r\nbrightness, his opportunity came. Wabi was to remain in camp, and\r\nMukoki, who was again of the belief that they were safe from the\r\nWoongas, was to follow one of the trap-lines alone. Supplying himself\r\nwell with food, taking Wabi's rifle, a double allowance of cartridges, a\r\nknife, belt-ax, and a heavy blanket in his pack, Rod set out for the\r\nchasm. Wabi laughed as he stood in the doorway to see him off.\r\n\r\n\"Good luck to you, Rod; hope you find gold,\" he cried gaily, waving a\r\nfinal good-by with his hand.\r\n\r\n\"If I don't return to-night don't you fellows worry about me,\" called\r\nback the youth. \"If things look promising I may camp in the chasm and\r\ntake up the hunt again in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe now passed quickly to the second ridge, knowing from previous\r\nexperience that it would be impossible to make a descent into the gulch\r\nfrom the first mountain. This range, a mile south of the camp, had not\r\nbeen explored by the hunters, but Rod was sure that there was no danger\r\nof losing himself as long as he followed along the edge of the chasm\r\nwhich was in itself a constant and infallible guide. Much to his\r\ndisappointment he found that the southern walls of this mysterious break\r\nbetween the mountains were as precipitous as those on the opposite side,\r\nand for two hours he looked in vain for a place where he might climb\r\ndown. The country was now becoming densely wooded and he was constantly\r\nencountering signs of big game. But he paid little attention to these.\r\nFinally he came to a point where the forest swept over and down the\r\nsteep side of the mountain, and to his great joy he saw that by\r\nstrapping his snow-shoes to his back and making good use of his hands it\r\nwas possible for him to make a descent.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later, breathless but triumphant, he stood at the bottom\r\nof the chasm. On his right rose the strip of cedar forest; on his left\r\nhe was shut in by towering walls of black and shattered rock. At his\r\nfeet was the little stream which had played such an important part in\r\nhis golden dreams, frozen in places, and in others kept clear of ice by\r\nthe swiftness of its current. A little ahead of him was that gloomy,\r\nsunless part of the chasm into which he had peered so often from the top\r\nof the ridge on the north. As he advanced step by step into its\r\nmysterious silence, his eyes alert, his nerves stretched to a tension of\r\nthe keenest expectancy, there crept over him a feeling that he was\r\ninvading that enchanted territory which, even at this moment, might be\r\nguarded by the spirits of the two mortals who had died because of the\r\ntreasure it held.\r\n\r\nNarrower and narrower became the walls high over his head. Not a ray of\r\nsunlight penetrated into the soundless gloom. Not a leaf shivered in the\r\nstill air. The creek gurgled and spattered among its rocks, without the\r\nnote of a bird or the chirp of a squirrel to interrupt its monotony.\r\nEverything was dead. Now and then Rod could hear the wind whispering\r\nover the top of the chasm. But not a breath of it came down to him.\r\nUnder his feet was only sufficient snow to deaden his own footsteps, and\r\nhe still carried his snow-shoes upon his back.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from the thick gloom that hung under one of the cragged walls,\r\nthere came a thundering, unearthly sound that made him stop, his rifle\r\nswung half to shoulder. He saw that he had disturbed a great owl, and\r\npassed on. Now and then he paused beside the creek and took up handful\r\nafter handful of its pebbles, his heart beating high with hope at every\r\nnew gleam he caught among them, and never sinking to disappointment\r\nthough he found no gold. The gold was here--somewhere. He was as certain\r\nof that as he was of the fact that he was living, and searching for it.\r\nEverything assured him of that; the towering masses of cleft rock, whole\r\nwalls seeming about to crumble into ruin, the broad margins of pebbles\r\nalong the creek--everything, to the very stillness and mystery in the\r\nair, spoke this as the abode of the skeletons' secret.\r\n\r\nIt was this inexplicable _something_--this unseen, mysterious element\r\nhovering in the air that caused the white youth to advance step by step,\r\nsilently, cautiously, as though the slightest sound under his feet might\r\nawaken the deadliest of enemies. And it was because of this stealth in\r\nhis progress that he came very close upon something that was living, and\r\nwithout startling it. Less than fifty yards ahead of him he saw an\r\nobject moving slowly among the rocks. It was a fox. Even before the\r\nanimal had detected his presence he had aimed and fired.\r\n\r\nThunderous echoes rose up about him. They rolled down the chasm, volume\r\nupon volume, until in the ghostly gloom between the mountain walls he\r\nstood and listened, a nervous shiver catching him once or twice. Not\r\nuntil the last echo had died away did he approach where the fox lay upon\r\nthe snow. It was not red. It was not black. It was not--\r\n\r\nHis heart gave a big excited thump. The bleeding creature at his feet\r\nwas the most beautiful animal he had ever seen--and the tip of its thick\r\nblack fur was silver gray.\r\n\r\nThen, in that lonely chasm, there went up a great human whoop of joy.\r\n\r\n\"A silver fox!\"\r\n\r\nRod spoke the words aloud. For five minutes he stood and looked upon his\r\nprize. He held it up and stroked it, and from what Wabi and Mukoki had\r\ntold him he knew that the silken pelt of this creature was worth more to\r\nthem than all the furs at the camp together.\r\n\r\nHe made no effort to skin it, but put the animal in his pack and resumed\r\nhis slow, noiseless exploration of the gulch.\r\n\r\nHe had now passed beyond those points in the range from which he had\r\nlooked down into this narrow, shut-in world. Ever more wild and gloomy\r\nbecame the chasm. At times the two walls of rock seemed almost to meet\r\nfar above his head; under gigantic, overhanging crags there lurked the\r\nshadows of night. Fascinated by the grandeur and loneliness of the\r\nscenes through which he was passing Rod forgot the travel of time. Mile\r\nafter mile he continued his tireless trail. He had no inclination to\r\neat. He stopped only once at the creek to drink. And when he looked at\r\nhis watch he was astonished to find that it was three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nIt was now too late to think of returning to camp. Within an hour the\r\nday gloom of the chasm would be thickening into that of night. So Rod\r\nstopped at the first good camp site, threw off his pack, and proceeded\r\nwith the building of a cedar shelter. Not until this was completed and a\r\nsufficient supply of wood for the night's fire was at hand did he begin\r\ngetting supper. He had brought a pail with him and soon the appetizing\r\nodors of boiling coffee and broiling moose sirloin filled the air.\r\n\r\nNight had fallen between the mountain walls by the time Rod sat down to\r\nhis meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nRODERICK'S DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\nA chilling loneliness now crept over the young adventurer. Even as he\r\nate he tried to peer out into the mysterious darkness. A sound from up\r\nthe chasm, made by some wild prowler of the night, sent a nervous tremor\r\nthrough him. He was not afraid; he would not have confessed to that. But\r\nstill, the absolute, almost gruesome silence between the two mountains,\r\nthe mere knowledge that he was alone in a place where the foot of man\r\nhad not trod for more than half a century, was not altogether quieting\r\nto his nerves. What mysteries might not these grim walls hold? What\r\nmight not happen here, where everything was so strange, so weird, and so\r\ndifferent from the wilderness world just over the range?\r\n\r\nRod tried to laugh away his nervousness, but the very sound of his own\r\nvoice was distressing. It rose in unnatural shivering echoes--a low,\r\nhollow mockery of a laugh beating itself against the walls; a ghost of a\r\nlaugh, Rod thought, and that very thought made him hunch closer to the\r\nfire. The young hunter was not superstitious, or at least he was not\r\nunnaturally so; but what man or boy is there in this whole wide world of\r\nours who does not, at some time, inwardly cringe from something in the\r\nair--something that does not exist and never did exist, but which holds\r\na peculiar and nameless fear for the soul of a human being?\r\n\r\nAnd Rod, as he piled his fire high with wood and shrank in the warmth of\r\nhis cedar shelter, felt that nameless dread; and there came to him no\r\nthought of sleep, no feeling of fatigue, but only that he was alone,\r\nabsolutely alone, in the mystery and almost unending silence of the\r\nchasm. Try as he would he could not keep from his mind the vision of the\r\nskeletons as he had first seen them in the old cabin.\r\n\r\nMany, many years ago, even before his own mother was born, those\r\nskeletons had trod this very chasm. They had drunk from the same creek\r\nas he, they had clambered over the same rocks, they had camped perhaps\r\nwhere he was camping now! They, too, in flesh and life, had strained\r\ntheir ears in the grim silence, they had watched the flickering light of\r\ntheir camp-fire on the walls of rock--and they had found gold!\r\n\r\nJust now, if Rod could have moved himself by magic, he would have been\r\nsafely back in camp. He listened. From far back over the trail he had\r\nfollowed there came a lonely, plaintive, almost pleading cry.\r\n\r\n\"'Ello--'ello--'ello!\"\r\n\r\nIt sounded like a distant human greeting, but Rod knew that it was the\r\nawakening night cry of what Wabi called the \"man owl.\" It was weirdly\r\nhuman-like; and the echoes came softly, and more softly, until ghostly\r\nvoices seemed to be whispering in the blackness about him.\r\n\r\n\"'Ello--'ello--'ello!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy shivered and laid his rifle across his knees. There was\r\ntremendous comfort in the rifle. Rod fondled it with his fingers, and\r\ntwo or three times he felt as though he would almost like to talk to it.\r\nOnly those who have gone far into the silence and desolation of the\r\nunblazed wilderness know just how human a good rifle becomes to its\r\nowner. It is a friend every hour of the night and day, faithful to its\r\nmaster's desires, keeping starvation at bay and holding death for his\r\nenemies; a guaranty of safety at his bedside by night, a sharp-fanged\r\nwatch-dog by day, never treacherous and never found wanting by the one\r\nwho bestows upon it the care of a comrade and friend. Thus had Rod come\r\nto look upon his rifle. He rubbed the barrel now with his mittens; he\r\npolished the stock as he sat in his loneliness, and long afterward,\r\nthough he had determined to remain awake during the night, he fell\r\nasleep with it clasped tightly in his hands.\r\n\r\nIt was an uneasy, troubled slumber in which the young adventurer's\r\nvisions and fears took a more realistic form. He half sat, half lay,\r\nupon his cedar boughs; his head fell forward upon his breast, his feet\r\nwere stretched out to the fire. Now and then unintelligible sounds fell\r\nfrom his lips, and he would start suddenly as if about to awaken, but\r\neach time would sink back into his restless sleep, still clutching the\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nThe visions in his head began to take a more definite form. Once more he\r\nwas on the trail, and had come to the old cabin. But this time he was\r\nalone. The window of the cabin was wide open, but the door was tightly\r\nclosed, just as the hunters had found it when they first came down into\r\nthe dip. He approached cautiously. When very near the window he heard\r\nsounds--strange sounds--like the clicking of bones!\r\n\r\nStep by step in his dream he approached the window and looked in. And\r\nthere he beheld a sight that froze him to the marrow. Two huge skeletons\r\nwere struggling in deadly embrace. He could hear no sound but the\r\nclick-click-click of their bones. He saw the gleam of knives held\r\nbetween fleshless fingers, and he saw now that both were struggling for\r\nthe possession of something that was upon the table. Now one almost\r\nreached it, now the other, but neither gained possession.\r\n\r\nThe clicking of the bones became louder, the struggle fiercer, the\r\nknives of the skeleton combatants rose and fell. Then one staggered back\r\nand sank in a heap on the floor.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the victor swayed, tottered to the table, and gripped the\r\nmysterious object in its bony fingers.\r\n\r\nAs it stumbled weakly against the cabin wall the gruesome creature held\r\nthe object up, and Rod saw that it was a roll of birch-bark!\r\n\r\nAn ember in the dying fire snapped with a sound like the report of a\r\nsmall pistol and Rod sat bolt upright, awake, staring, trembling. What a\r\nhorrible dream! He drew in his cramped legs and approached the fire on\r\nhis knees, holding his rifle in one hand while he piled on wood with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWhat a horrible dream!\r\n\r\nHe shuddered and ran his eyes around the impenetrable wall of blackness\r\nthat shut him in, the thought constantly flashing through his mind, what\r\na horrible dream--what a horrible dream!\r\n\r\nHe sat down again and watched the flames of his fire as they climbed\r\nhigher and higher. The light and the heat cheered him, and after a\r\nlittle he allowed his mind to dwell upon the adventure of his slumber.\r\nIt had made him sweat. He took off his cap and found that the hair about\r\nhis forehead was damp.\r\n\r\nAll the different phases of a dream return to one singly when awake, and\r\nit was with the suddenness of a shot that there came to Rod a\r\nremembrance of the skeleton hand held aloft, clutching between its\r\ngleaming fleshless fingers the roll of birch-bark. And with that memory\r\nof his dream there came another--the skeleton in the cabin was clutching\r\na piece of birch-bark when they had buried it!\r\n\r\nCould that crumpled bit of bark hold the secret of the lost mine?\r\n\r\nWas it for the possession of that bark instead of the buckskin bag that\r\nthe men had fought and died?\r\n\r\nAs the minutes passed Rod forgot his loneliness, forgot his nervousness\r\nand only thought of the possibilities of the new clue that had come to\r\nhim in a dream. Wabi and Mukoki had seen the bark clutched in the\r\nskeleton fingers, but they as well as he had given it no special\r\nsignificance, believing that it had been caught up in some terrible part\r\nof the struggle when both combatants were upon the floor, or perhaps in\r\nthe dying agonies of the wounded man against the wall. Rod remembered\r\nnow that they had found no more birch-bark upon the floor, which they\r\nwould have done if a supply had been kept there for kindling fires. Step\r\nby step he went over the search they had made in the old cabin, and more\r\nand more satisfied did he become that the skeleton hand held something\r\nof importance for them.\r\n\r\nHe replenished his fire and waited impatiently for dawn. At four\r\no'clock, before day had begun to dispel the gloom of night, he cooked\r\nhis breakfast and prepared his pack for the homeward journey. Soon\r\nafterward a narrow rim of light broke through the rift in the chasm.\r\nSlowly it crept downward, until the young hunter could make out objects\r\nnear him and the walls of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThick shadows still defied his vision when he began retracing his steps\r\nover the trail he had made the day before. He returned with the same\r\ncaution that he had used in his advance. Even more carefully, if\r\npossible, did he scrutinize the rocks and the creek ahead. He had\r\nalready found life in the chasm, and he might find more.\r\n\r\nThe full light of day came quickly now, and with it the youth's progress\r\nbecame more rapid. He figured that if he lost no time in further\r\ninvestigation of the creek he would arrive at camp by noon, and they\r\nwould dig up the skeleton without delay. There was little snow in the\r\nchasm, in spite of the lateness of the season, and if the roll of bark\r\nheld the secret of the lost gold it would be possible for them to locate\r\nthe treasure before other snows came to baffle them.\r\n\r\nAt the spot where he had killed the silver fox Rod paused for a moment.\r\nHe wondered if foxes ever traveled in pairs, and regretted that he had\r\nnot asked Wabi or Mukoki that question. He could see where the fox had\r\ncome straight from the black wall of the mountain. Curiosity led him\r\nover the trail. He had not followed it more than two hundred yards when\r\nhe stopped in sudden astonishment. Plainly marked in the snow before him\r\nwas the trail of a pair of snow-shoes! Whoever had been there had passed\r\nsince he shot the fox, for the imprints of the animal's feet were buried\r\nunder those of the snow-shoes.\r\n\r\nWho was the other person in the chasm?\r\n\r\nWas it Wabi?\r\n\r\nHad Mukoki or he come to join him? Or--\r\n\r\nHe looked again at the snow-shoe trail. It was a peculiar trail, unlike\r\nthe one made by his own shoes. The imprints were a foot longer than his\r\nown, and narrower. Neither Wabi nor Mukoki wore shoes that would make\r\nthat trail!\r\n\r\nAt this point the strange trail had turned and disappeared among the\r\nrocks along the wall of the mountain, and it occurred to Rod that\r\nperhaps the stranger had not discovered his presence in the chasm. There\r\nwas some consolation in this thought, but it was doomed to quick\r\ndisappointment. Very cautiously the youth advanced, his rifle held in\r\nreadiness and his eyes searching every place of concealment ahead of\r\nhim. A hundred yards farther on the stranger had stopped, and from the\r\nway in which the snow was packed Rod knew that he had stood in a\r\nlistening and watchful attitude for some time. From this point the trail\r\ntook another turn and came down until, from behind a huge rock, the\r\nstranger had cautiously peered out upon the path made by the white\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he was extremely anxious to prevent the discovery of\r\nhis own trail, for now the mysterious spy threaded his way behind rocks\r\nuntil he had again come to the shelter of the mountain wall.\r\n\r\nRod was perplexed. He realized the peril of his dilemma, and yet he knew\r\nnot what course to take to evade it. He had little doubt that the trail\r\nwas made by one of the treacherous Woongas, and that the Indian not only\r\nknew of his presence, but was somewhere in the rocks ahead of him,\r\nperhaps even now waiting behind some ambuscade to shoot him. Should he\r\nfollow the trail, or would it be safer to steal along among the rocks of\r\nthe opposite wall of the chasm?\r\n\r\nHe had decided upon the latter course when his eyes caught a narrow\r\nhorizontal slit cleaving the face of the mountain on his left, toward\r\nwhich the snow-shoe tracks seemed to lead. With his rifle ready for\r\ninstant use the youth slowly approached the fissure, and was surprised\r\nto find that it was a complete break in the wall of rock, not more than\r\nfour feet wide, and continuing on a steady incline to the summit of the\r\nridge. At the mouth of this fissure his mysterious watcher had taken off\r\nhis snow-shoes and Rod could see where he had climbed up the narrow exit\r\nfrom the chasm.\r\n\r\nWith a profound sense of relief the young hunter hurried along the base\r\nof the mountain, keeping well within its shelter so that eyes that might\r\nbe spying from above could not see his movements. He now felt no fear of\r\ndanger. The stranger's flight up the cleft in the chasm wall and his\r\ncareful attempts to conceal his trail among the rocks assured Rod that\r\nhe had no designs upon his life. His chief purpose had seemed to be to\r\nkeep secret his own presence in the gorge, and this fact in itself added\r\nto the mystification of the white youth. For a long time he had been\r\nsecretly puzzled, and had evolved certain ideas of his own because of\r\nthe movements of the Woongas. Contrary to the opinions of Mukoki and\r\nWabigoon, he believed that the red outlaws were perfectly conscious of\r\ntheir presence in the dip. From the first their actions had been\r\nunaccountable, but not once had one of their snow-shoe trails crossed\r\ntheir trap-lines.\r\n\r\nWas this fact in itself not significant? Rod was of a contemplative\r\ntheoretical turn of mind, one of those wide-awake, interesting young\r\nfellows who find food for conjecture in almost every incident that\r\noccurs, and his suspicions were now aroused to an unusual pitch. A chief\r\nfault, however, was that he kept most of his suspicions to himself, for\r\nhe believed that Mukoki and Wabigoon, born and taught in the life of the\r\nwilderness, were infallible in their knowledge of the ways and the laws\r\nand the perils of the world they were in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF THE SKELETON'S HAND\r\n\r\n\r\nA little before noon Rod arrived at the top of the hill from which he\r\ncould look down on their camp. He was filled with pleasurable\r\nanticipation, and with an unbounded swelling satisfaction that caused\r\nhim to smile as he proceeded into the dip. He had found a fortune in the\r\nmysterious chasm. The burden of the silver fox upon his shoulders was a\r\nmost pleasing reminder of that, and he pictured the moment when the\r\ngood-natured raillery of Mukoki and Wabigoon would be suddenly turned\r\ninto astonishment and joy.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the cabin the young hunter tried to appear disgusted\r\nand half sick, and his effort was not bad in spite of his decided\r\ninclination to laugh. Wabi met him in the doorway, grinning broadly, and\r\nMukoki greeted him with a throatful of his inimitable chuckles.\r\n\r\n\"Aha, here's Rod with a packful of gold!\" cried the young Indian,\r\nstriking an expectant attitude. \"Will you let us see the treasure?\" In\r\nspite of his banter there was gladness in his face at Rod's arrival.\r\n\r\nThe youth threw off his pack with a spiritless effort and flopped into a\r\nchair as though in the last stage of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to undo the pack,\" he replied. \"I'm too tired and hungry.\"\r\n\r\nWabi's manner changed at once to one of real sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet you're tired, Rod, and half starved. We'll have dinner in a\r\nhurry. Ho, Muky, put on the steak, will you?\"\r\n\r\nThere followed a rattle of kettles and tin pans and the Indian youth\r\ngave Rod a glad slap on the back as he hurried to the table. He was\r\nevidently in high spirits, and burst into a snatch of song as he cut up\r\na loaf of bread.\r\n\r\n\"I'm tickled to see you back,\" he admitted, \"for I was getting a little\r\nbit nervous. We had splendid luck on our lines yesterday. Brought in\r\nanother 'cross' and three mink. Did you see anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to look in the pack?\"\r\n\r\nWabi turned and gazed at his companion with a half-curious hesitating\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Anything in it?\" he asked suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"See here, boys,\" cried Rod, forgetting himself in his suppressed\r\nenthusiasm. \"I said there was a treasure in that chasm, and there was. I\r\nfound it. You are welcome to look into that pack if you wish!\"\r\n\r\nWabi dropped the knife with which he was cutting the bread and went to\r\nthe pack. He touched it with the toe of his boot, lifted it in his\r\nhands, and glanced at Rod again.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a joke?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nRod turned his back upon the scene and began to take off his coat as\r\ncoolly as though it were the commonest thing in the world for him to\r\nbring silver foxes into camp. Only when Wabi gave a suppressed yell did\r\nhe turn about, and then he found the Indian standing erect and holding\r\nout the silver to the astonished gaze of Mukoki.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a good one?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"A beauty!\" gasped Wabi.\r\n\r\nMukoki had taken the animal and was examining it with the critical eyes\r\nof a connoisseur.\r\n\r\n\"Ver' fine!\" he said. \"At Post heem worth fi' hundred dollars--at\r\nMontreal t'ree hundred more!\"\r\n\r\nWabi strode across the cabin and thrust out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Shake, Rod!\"\r\n\r\nAs the two gripped hands he turned to Mukoki.\r\n\r\n\"Bear witness, Mukoki, that this young gentleman is no longer a\r\ntenderfoot. He has shot a silver fox. He has done a whole winter's work\r\nin one day. I take off my hat to you, Mr. Drew!\"\r\n\r\nRoderick's face reddened with a flush of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"And that isn't all, Wabi,\" he said. His eyes were filled with a sudden\r\nintense earnestness, and in the strangeness of the change Wabi forgot to\r\nloosen the grip of his fingers about his companion's hand.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean that you found--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't find gold,\" anticipated Rod. \"But the gold is there! I\r\nknow it. And I think I have found a clue. You remember that when you and\r\nI examined the skeleton against the wall we saw that it clutched\r\nsomething that looked like birch-bark in its hand? Well, I believe that\r\nbirch-bark holds the key to the lost mine!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki had come beside them and stood listening to Rod, his face alive\r\nwith keen interest. In Wabi's eyes there was a look half of doubt, half\r\nof belief.\r\n\r\n\"It might,\" he said slowly. \"It wouldn't do any harm to see.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped to the stove and took off the partly cooked steak. Rod\r\nslipped on his coat and hat and Mukoki seized his belt-ax and the\r\nshovel. No words were spoken, but there was a mutual understanding that\r\nthe investigation was to precede dinner. Wabi was silent and thoughtful\r\nand Rod could see that his suggestion had at least made a deep\r\nimpression upon him. Mukoki's eyes began to gleam again with the old\r\nfire with which he had searched the cabin for gold.\r\n\r\nThe skeletons were buried only a few inches deep in the frozen earth in\r\nthe edge of the cedar forest, and Mukoki soon exposed them to view.\r\nAlmost the first object that met their eyes was the skeleton hand\r\nclutching its roll of birch-bark. It was Rod who dropped upon his knees\r\nto the gruesome task.\r\n\r\nWith a shudder at the touch of the cold bones he broke the fingers back.\r\nOne of them snapped with a sharp sound, and as he rose with the bark in\r\nhis hand his face was bloodlessly white. The bones were covered again\r\nand the three returned to the cabin.\r\n\r\nStill silent, they gathered about the table. With age the bark of the\r\nbirch hardens and rolls itself tightly, and the piece Rod held was\r\nalmost like thin steel. Inch by inch it was spread out, cracking and\r\nsnapping in brittle protest. The hunters could see that the bark was in\r\na single unbroken strip about ten inches long by six in width. Two\r\ninches, three, four were unrolled--and still the smooth surface was\r\nblank. Another half-inch, and the bark refused to unroll farther.\r\n\r\n\"Careful!\" whispered Wabi.\r\n\r\nWith the point of his knife he loosened the cohesion.\r\n\r\n\"I guess--there's--nothing--\" began Rod.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke he caught his breath. A mark had appeared on the bark,\r\na black, meaningless mark with a line running down from it into the\r\nscroll.\r\n\r\nAnother fraction of an inch and the line was joined by a second, and\r\nthen with an unexpectedness that was startling the remainder of the roll\r\nreleased itself like a spring--and to the eyes of the three wolf hunters\r\nwas revealed the secret of the skeleton hand.\r\n\r\nSpread out before them was a map, or at least what they at once accepted\r\nas a map, though in reality it was more of a crude diagram of straight\r\nand crooked lines, with here and there a partly obliterated word to give\r\nit meaning. In several places there were mere evidences of words, now\r\nentirely illegible. But what first held the attention of Rod and his\r\ncompanions were several lines in writing under the rough sketch on the\r\nbark, still quite plain, which formed the names of three men. Roderick\r\nread them aloud.\r\n\r\n\"John Ball, Henri Langlois, Peter Plante.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the name of John Ball had been drawn a broad black line which\r\nhad almost destroyed the letters, and at the end of this line, in\r\nbrackets, was printed a word in French which Wabi quickly translated.\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" he breathed. \"The Frenchmen killed him!\"\r\n\r\nThe words shot from him in hot excitement.\r\n\r\nRod did not reply. Slowly he drew a trembling finger over the map. The\r\nfirst word he encountered was unintelligible. Of the next he could only\r\nmake out one letter, which gave him no clue. Evidently the map had been\r\nmade with a different and less durable substance than that with which\r\nthe names had been written. He followed down the first straight black\r\nline, and where this formed a junction with a wider crooked line were\r\ntwo words quite distinct:\r\n\r\n\"Second waterfall.\"\r\n\r\nHalf an inch below this Rod could make out the letters T, D and L,\r\nwidely scattered.\r\n\r\n\"That's the third waterfall,\" he exclaimed eagerly.\r\n\r\nAt this point the crude lines of the diagram stopped, and immediately\r\nbelow, between the map and the three names, it was evident that there\r\nhad been considerable writing. But not a word of it could the young\r\nhunters make out. That writing, without doubt, had given the key to the\r\nlost gold. Rod looked up, his face betraying the keenness of his\r\ndisappointment. He knew that under his hand he held all that was left of\r\nthe secret of a great treasure. But he was more baffled than ever.\r\nSomewhere in this vast desolation there were three waterfalls, and\r\nsomewhere near the third waterfall the Englishman and the two Frenchmen\r\nhad found their gold. That was all he knew. He had not found a waterfall\r\nin the chasm; they had not discovered one in all their trapping and\r\nhunting excursions.\r\n\r\nWabi was looking down into his face in silent thought. Suddenly he\r\nreached out and seized the sheet of bark and examined it closely. As he\r\nlooked there came a deeper flush in his face, his eyes brightened and he\r\ngave a cry of excitement.\r\n\r\n\"By George, I believe we can peel this!\" he cried. \"See here, Muky!\" He\r\nthrust the birch under the old Indian's eyes. Even Mukoki's hands were\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n\"Birch-bark is made up of a good many layers, each as thin as the\r\nthinnest paper,\" he explained to Rod as Mukoki continued his\r\nexamination. \"If we can peel off that first layer, and then hold it up\r\nto the light, we shall be able to see the impression of every word that\r\nwas ever made on it--even though they were written a hundred years ago!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki had gone to the door, and now he turned, grinning exultantly.\r\n\r\n\"She peel!\"\r\n\r\nHe showed them where he had stripped back a corner of the film-like\r\nlayer. Then he sat down in the light, his head bent over, and for many\r\nminutes he worked at his tedious task while Wabi and Rod hung back in\r\nsoundless suspense. Half an hour later Mukoki straightened himself, rose\r\nto his feet and held out the precious film to Rod.\r\n\r\nAs tenderly as though his own life depended upon its care, Rod held the\r\npiece of birch, now a silken, almost transparent sheet, between himself\r\nand the light. A cry welled up into his throat. It was repeated by Wabi.\r\nAnd then there was silence--a silence broken only by their bated breaths\r\nand the excited thumpings of their hearts.\r\n\r\nAs though they had been written but yesterday, the mysterious words on\r\nthe map were disclosed to their eyes. Where Rod had made out only three\r\nletters there were now plainly discernible the two words \"third\r\nwaterfall,\" and very near to these was the word \"cabin.\" Below them were\r\nseveral lines, clearly impressed in the birch film. Slowly, his voice\r\ntrembling, Rod read them to his companions.\r\n\r\n\"We, John Ball, Henri Langlois, and Peter Plante, having discovered gold\r\nat this fall, do hereby agree to joint partnership in the same, and do\r\npledge ourselves to forget our past differences and work in mutual good\r\nwill and honesty, so help us God. Signed,\r\n\r\n\"JOHN BALL, HENRI LANGLOIS, PETER PLANTE.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very top of the map the impression of several other words caught\r\nRod's eyes. They were more indistinct than any of the others, but one by\r\none he made them out. A hot blurring film seemed to fall over his eyes\r\nand he felt as though his heart had suddenly come up into his throat.\r\nWabi's breath was burning against his cheek, and it was Wabi who spoke\r\nthe words aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Cabin and head of chasm.\"\r\n\r\nRod went back to the table and sat down, the precious bit of birch-bark\r\nunder his hand. Mukoki, standing mute, had listened and heard, and was\r\nas if stunned by their discovery. But now his mind returned to the moose\r\nsteak, and he placed it on the stove. Wabi stood with his hands in his\r\npockets, and after a little he laughed a trembling, happy laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Rod, you've found your mine. You are as good as rich!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that we have found our mine,\" corrected the white youth. \"We\r\nare three, and we just naturally fill the places of John Ball, Henri\r\nLanglois and Peter Plante. They are all dead. The gold is ours!\"\r\n\r\nWabi had taken up the map.\r\n\r\n\"I can't see the slightest possibility of our not finding it,\" he said.\r\n\"The directions are as plain as day. We follow the chasm, and somewhere\r\nin that chasm we come to a waterfall. A little beyond this the creek\r\nthat runs through the gorge empties into a larger stream, and we follow\r\nthis second creek or river until we come to the third fall. The cabin is\r\nthere, and the gold can not be far away.\"\r\n\r\nHe had carried the map to the door again, and Rod joined him.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing that gives us an idea of distance on the map,\" he\r\ncontinued. \"How far did you travel down the chasm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten miles, at least,\" replied Rod.\r\n\r\n\"And you discovered no fall?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nWith a splinter picked up from the floor Wabi measured the distances\r\nbetween the different points on the diagram.\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt but what this map was drawn by John Ball,\" he said\r\nafter a few moments of silent contemplation. \"Everything points to that\r\nfact. Notice that all of the writing is in one hand, except the\r\nsignatures of Langlois and Plante, and you could hardly decipher the\r\nletters in those signatures if you did not already know their names from\r\nthis writing below. Ball wrote a good hand, and from the construction of\r\nthe agreement over the signatures he was a man of pretty fair education.\r\nDon't you think so? Well, he must have drawn this map with some idea of\r\ndistance in his mind. The second fall is only half as far from the first\r\nfall as the third fall is from the second, which seems to me conclusive\r\nevidence of this. If he had not had distance in mind he would not have\r\nseparated the falls in this way on the map.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if we can find the first fall we can figure pretty nearly how far\r\nthe last fall is from the head of the chasm,\" said Rod.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I believe the distance from here to the first fall will give us a\r\nkey to the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\nRod had produced a pencil from one of his pockets and was figuring on\r\nthe smooth side of a chip.\r\n\r\n\"The gold is a long way from here at the best, Wabi. I explored the\r\nchasm for ten miles. Say that we find the first fall within fifteen\r\nmiles. Then, according to the map, the second fall would be about twenty\r\nmiles from the first, and the third forty miles from the second. If the\r\nfirst fall is within fifteen miles of this cabin the third fall is at\r\nleast seventy-five miles away.\"\r\n\r\nWabi nodded.\r\n\r\n\"But we may not find the first fall within that distance,\" he said. \"By\r\nGeorge--\" He stopped and looked at Rod with an odd look of doubt in his\r\nface. \"If the gold is seventy-five or a hundred miles away, why were\r\nthose men here, and with only a handful of nuggets in their possession?\r\nIs it possible that the gold played out--that they found only what was\r\nin the buckskin bag?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that were so, why should they have fought to the death for the\r\npossession of the map?\" argued Rod.\r\n\r\nMukoki was turning the steak. He had not spoken, but now he said:\r\n\r\n\"Mebby going to Post for supplies.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what they were doing!\" shouted the Indian youth. \"Muky,\r\nyou have solved the whole problem. They were going for supplies. And\r\nthey didn't fight for the map--not for the map alone!\"\r\n\r\nHis face flushed with new excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I am wrong, but it all seems clear to me now,\" he continued.\r\n\"Ball and the two Frenchmen worked their find until they ran out of\r\nsupplies. Wabinosh House is over a hundred years old, and fifty years\r\nago that was the nearest point where they could get more. In some way it\r\nfell to the Frenchmen to go. They had probably accumulated a hoard of\r\ngold, and before they left they murdered Ball. They brought with them\r\nonly enough gold to pay for their supplies, for it was their purpose not\r\nto arouse the suspicion of any adventurers who happened to be at the\r\nPost. They could easily have explained their possession of those few\r\nnuggets. In this cabin either Langlois or Plante tried to kill his\r\ncompanion, and thus become the sole possessor of the treasure, and the\r\nfight, fatal to both, ensued. I may be wrong, but--by George, I believe\r\nthat is what happened!\"\r\n\r\n\"And that they buried the bulk of their gold somewhere back near the\r\nthird fall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; or else they brought the gold here and buried it somewhere near\r\nthis very cabin!\"\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted by Mukoki.\r\n\r\n\"Dinner ready!\" he called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSNOWED IN\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the present moment Rod had forgotten to speak of the mysterious\r\nman-trail he had encountered in the chasm. The excitement of the past\r\nhour had made him oblivious to all other things, but now as they ate\r\ntheir dinner he described the strange maneuvers of the spying Woonga. He\r\ndid not, however, voice those fears which had come to him in the gorge,\r\npreferring to allow Mukoki and Wabigoon to draw their own conclusions.\r\nBy this time the two Indians were satisfied that the Woongas were not\r\ncontemplating attack, but that for some unaccountable reason they were\r\nas anxious to evade the hunters as the hunters were to evade them.\r\nEverything that had passed seemed to give evidence of this. The outlaw\r\nin the chasm, for instance, could easily have waylaid Rod; a dozen times\r\nthe almost defenseless camp could have been attacked, and there were\r\ninnumerable places where ambushes might have been laid for them along\r\nthe trap-lines.\r\n\r\nSo Rod's experience with the Woonga trail between the mountains\r\noccasioned little uneasiness, and instead of forming a scheme for the\r\nfurther investigation of this trail on the south, plans were made for\r\nlocating the first fall. Mukoki was the swiftest and most tireless\r\ntraveler on snow-shoes, and it was he who volunteered to make the first\r\nsearch. He would leave the following morning, taking with him a supply\r\nof food, and during his absence Rod and Wabigoon would attend to the\r\ntraps.\r\n\r\n\"We must have the location of the first fall before we return to the\r\nPost,\" declared Wabi. \"If from that we find that the third fall is not\r\nwithin a hundred miles of our present camp it will be impossible for us\r\nto go in search of our gold during this trip. In that event we shall\r\nhave to go back to Wabinosh House and form a new expedition, with fresh\r\nsupplies and the proper kind of tools. We can not do anything until the\r\nspring freshets are over, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking of that,\" replied Rod, his eyes softening. \"You\r\nknow mother is alone, and--her--\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" interrupted the Indian boy, laying a hand fondly across\r\nhis companion's arm.\r\n\r\n\"--her funds are small, you know,\" Rod finished. \"If she has been\r\nsick--or--anything like that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we've got to get back with our furs,\" helped Wabi, a tremor of\r\ntenderness in his own voice. \"And if you don't mind, Rod, I might take a\r\nlittle run down to Detroit with you. Do you suppose she would care?\"\r\n\r\n\"Care!\" shouted Rod, bringing his free hand down upon Wabi's arm with a\r\nforce that hurt. \"Care! Why, she thinks as much of you as she does of\r\nme, Wabi! She'd be tickled to death! Do you mean it?\"\r\n\r\nWabi's bronzed face flushed a deeper red at his friend's enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"I won't promise--for sure,\" he said. \"But I'd like to see her--almost\r\nas much as you, I guess. If I can, I'll go.\"\r\n\r\nRod's face was suffused with a joyful glow.\r\n\r\n\"And I'll come back with you early in the summer and we'll start out for\r\nthe gold,\" he cried. He jumped to his feet and slapped Mukoki on the\r\nback in the happy turn his mind had taken. \"Will you come, too, Mukoki?\r\nI'll give you the biggest 'city time' you ever had in your life!\"\r\n\r\nThe old Indian grinned and chuckled and grunted, but did not reply in\r\nwords. Wabi laughed, and answered for him.\r\n\r\n\"He is too anxious to become Minnetaki's slave again, Rod. No, Muky\r\nwon't go, I'll wager that. He will stay at the Post to see that she\r\ndoesn't get lost, or hurt, or stolen by the Woongas. Eh, Mukoki?\" Mukoki\r\nnodded, grinning good-humoredly. He went to the door, opened it and\r\nlooked out.\r\n\r\n\"Devil--she snow!\" he cried. \"She snow like twent' t'ousand--like\r\ndevil!\"\r\n\r\nThis was the strongest English in the old warrior's vocabulary, and it\r\nmeant something more than usual. Wabi and Rod quickly joined him. Never\r\nin his life had the city youth seen a snow-storm like that which he now\r\ngazed out into. The great north storm had arrived--a storm which comes\r\njust once each year in the endless Arctic desolation. For days and weeks\r\nthe Indians had expected it and wondered at its lateness. It fell\r\nsoftly, silently, without a breath of air to stir it; a smothering,\r\nvoiceless sea of white, impenetrable to human vision, so thick that it\r\nseemed as though it might stifle one's breath. Rod held out the palm of\r\nhis hand and in an instant it was covered with a film of white. He\r\nwalked out into it, and a dozen yards away he became a ghostly, almost\r\ninvisible shadow.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back a minute later he brought a load of snow into the\r\ncabin with him.\r\n\r\nAll that afternoon the snow fell like this, and all that night the storm\r\ncontinued. When he awoke in the morning Rod heard the wind whistling and\r\nhowling through the trees and around the ends of the cabin. He rose and\r\nbuilt the fire while the others were still sleeping. He attempted to\r\nopen the door, but it was blocked. He lowered the barricade at the\r\nwindow, and a barrel of snow tumbled in about his feet. He could see no\r\nsign of day, and when he turned he saw Wabi sitting up in his blankets,\r\nlaughing silently at his wonder and consternation.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world--\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"We're snowed in,\" grinned Wabi. \"Does the stove smoke?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Rod, throwing a bewildered glance at the roaring fire.\r\n\"You don't mean to say--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we are not completely, buried,\" interrupted the other. \"At least\r\nthe top of the chimney is sticking out!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki sat up and stretched himself.\r\n\r\n\"She blow,\" he said, as a tremendous howl of wind swept over the cabin.\r\n\"Bime-by she blow some more!\"\r\n\r\nRod shoveled the snow into a corner and replaced the barricade while his\r\ncompanions dressed.\r\n\r\n\"This means a week's work digging out traps,\" declared Wabi. \"And only\r\nMukoki's Great Spirit, who sends all blessings to this country, knows\r\nwhen the blizzard is going to stop. It may last a week. There is no\r\nchance of finding our waterfall in this.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can play dominoes,\" suggested Rod cheerfully. \"You remember we\r\nhaven't finished that series we began at the Post. But you don't expect\r\nme to believe that it snowed enough yesterday afternoon and last night\r\nto cover this cabin, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It didn't exactly _snow_ enough to cover it,\" explained his comrade.\r\n\"But we're covered for all of that. The cabin is on the edge of an open,\r\nand of course the snow just naturally drifts around us, blown there by\r\nthe wind. If this blizzard keeps up we shall be under a small mountain\r\nby night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't it--smother us?\" faltered Rod.\r\n\r\nWabi gave a joyous whoop of merriment at the city-bred youth's\r\nhalf-expressed fear and a volley of Mukoki's chuckles came from where he\r\nwas slicing moose-steak on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Snow mighty nice thing live under,\" he asserted with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"If you were under a mountain of snow you could live, if you weren't\r\ncrushed to death,\" said Wabi. \"Snow is filled with air. Mukoki was\r\ncaught under a snow-slide once and was buried under thirty feet for ten\r\nhours. He had made a nest about as big as a barrel and was nice and\r\ncomfortable when we dug him out. We won't have to burn much wood to keep\r\nwarm now.\"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the boys again lowered the barricade at the window and\r\nWabi began to bring small avalanches of snow down into the cabin with\r\nhis shovel. At the third or fourth upward thrust a huge mass plunged\r\nthrough the window, burying them to the waist, and when they looked out\r\nthey could see the light of day and the whirling blizzard above their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\"It's up to the roof,\" gasped Rod. \"Great Scott, what a snow-storm!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now for some fun!\" cried the Indian youth. \"Come on, Rod, if you want\r\nto be in it.\"\r\n\r\nHe crawled through the window into the cavity he had made in the drift,\r\nand Rod followed. Wabi waited, a mischievous smile on his face, and no\r\nsooner had his companion joined him than he plunged his shovel deep into\r\nthe base of the drift. Half a dozen quick thrusts and there tumbled down\r\nupon their heads a mass of light snow that for a few moments completely\r\nburied them. The suddenness of it knocked Rod to his knees, where he\r\nfloundered, gasped and made a vain effort to yell. Struggling like a\r\nfish he first kicked his feet free, and Wabi, who had thrust out his\r\nhead and shoulders, shrieked with laughter as he saw only Rod's boots\r\nsticking out of the snow.\r\n\r\n\"You're going the wrong way, Rod!\" he shouted. \"Wow--wow!\"\r\n\r\nHe seized his companion's legs and helped to drag him out, and then\r\nstood shaking, the tears streaming down his face, and continued to laugh\r\nuntil he leaned back in the drift, half exhausted. Rod was a curious and\r\nludicrous-looking object. His eyes were wide and blinking; the snow was\r\nin his ears, his mouth, and in his floundering he had packed his coat\r\ncollar full of it. Slowly he recovered from his astonishment, saw Wabi\r\nand Mukoki quivering with laughter, grinned--and then joined them in\r\ntheir merriment.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult now for the boys to force their way through the\r\ndrift and they were soon standing waist-deep in the snow twenty yards\r\nfrom the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"The snow is only about four feet deep in the open,\" said Wabi. \"But\r\nlook at that!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and gazed at the cabin, or rather at the small part of it\r\nwhich still rose triumphant above the huge drift which had almost\r\ncompletely buried it. Only a little of the roof, with the smoking\r\nchimney rising out of it, was to be seen. Rod now turned in all\r\ndirections to survey the wild scene about him. There had come a brief\r\nlull in the blizzard, and his vision extended beyond the lake and to the\r\nhilltop. There was not a spot of black to meet his eyes; every rock was\r\nhidden; the trees hung silent and lifeless under their heavy mantles and\r\neven their trunks were beaten white with the clinging volleys of the\r\nstorm. There came to him then a thought of the wild things in this\r\nseemingly uninhabitable desolation. How could they live in this endless\r\ndesert of snow? What could they find to eat? Where could they find water\r\nto drink? He asked Wabi these questions after they had returned to the\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\"Just now, if you traveled from here to the end of this storm zone you\r\nwouldn't find a living four-legged creature,\" said Wabigoon. \"Every\r\nmoose in this country, every deer and caribou, every fox and wolf, is\r\nburied in the snow. And as the snow falls deeper about them the warmer\r\nand more comfortable do they become, so that even as the blizzard\r\nincreases in fury the kind Creator makes it easier for them to bear.\r\nWhen the storm ceases the wilderness will awaken into life again. The\r\nmoose and deer and caribou will rise from their snow-beds and begin to\r\neat the boughs of trees and saplings; a crust will have formed on the\r\nsnow, and all the smaller animals, like foxes, lynx and wolves, will\r\nbegin to travel again, and to prey upon others for food. Until they find\r\nrunning water again snow and ice take the place of liquid drink; warm\r\ncaverns dug in the snow give refuge in place of thick swamp moss and\r\nbrush and leaves. All the big animals, like moose, deer and caribou,\r\nwill soon make 'yards' for themselves by trampling down large areas of\r\nsnow, and in these yards they will gather in big herds, eating their way\r\nthrough the forests, fighting the wolves and waiting for spring. Oh,\r\nlife isn't altogether bad for the animals in a deep winter like this!\"\r\n\r\nUntil noon the hunters were busy cleaning away the snow from the cabin\r\ndoor. As the day advanced the blizzard increased in its fury, until,\r\nwith the approach of night, it became impossible for the hunters to\r\nexpose themselves to it. For three days the storm continued with only\r\nintermittent lulls, but with the dawn of the fourth day the sky was\r\nagain cloudless, and the sun rose with a blinding effulgence. Rod now\r\nfound himself suffering from that sure affliction of every tenderfoot in\r\nthe far North--snow-blindness. For only a few minutes at a time could he\r\nstand the dazzling reflections of the snow-waste where nothing but\r\nwhite, flashing, scintillating white, seemingly a vast sea of burning\r\nelectric points in the sunlight, met his aching eyes. On the second day\r\nafter the storm, while Wabi was still inuring Rod to the changed world\r\nand teaching him how to accustom his eyes to it gradually, Mukoki left\r\nthe cabin to follow the chasm in his search for the first waterfall.\r\n\r\nThat same day Wabi began his work of digging out and resetting the\r\ntraps, but it was not until the day following that Rod's eyes would\r\nallow him to assist. The task was a most difficult one; rocks and other\r\nlandmarks were completely hidden, and the lost traps averaged one out of\r\nfour. It was not until the end of the second day after Mukoki's\r\ndeparture that the young hunters finished the mountain trap-line, and\r\nwhen they turned their faces toward camp just at the beginning of dusk\r\nit was with the expectant hope that they would find the old Indian\r\nawaiting them. But Mukoki had not returned. The next day came and\r\npassed, and a fourth dawned without his arrival. Hope now gave way to\r\nfear. In three days Mukoki could travel nearly a hundred miles. Was it\r\npossible that something had happened to him? Many times there recurred\r\nto Rod a thought of the Woonga in the chasm. Had the mysterious spy, or\r\nsome of his people, waylaid and killed him?\r\n\r\nNeither of the hunters had a desire to leave camp during the fourth day.\r\nTrapping was exceptionally good now on account of the scarcity of animal\r\nfood and since the big storm they had captured a wolf, two lynx, a red\r\nfox and eight mink. But as Mukoki's absence lengthened their enthusiasm\r\ngrew less.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, as they were watching, they saw a figure climb wearily\r\nto the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\nIt was Mukoki.\r\n\r\nWith shouts of greeting both youths hurried through the snow toward him,\r\nnot taking time to strap on their snow-shoes. The old Indian was at\r\ntheir side a couple of minutes later. He smiled in a tired good-natured\r\nway, and answered the eagerness in their eyes with a nod of his head.\r\n\r\n\"Found fall. Fift' mile down mountain.\"\r\n\r\nOnce in the cabin he dropped into a chair, exhausted, and both Rod and\r\nWabigoon joined in relieving him of his boots and outer garments. It was\r\nevident that Mukoki had been traveling hard, for only once or twice\r\nbefore in his life had Wabi seen him so completely fatigued. Quickly the\r\nyoung Indian had a huge steak broiling over the fire, and Rod put an\r\nextra handful of coffee in the pot.\r\n\r\n\"Fifty miles!\" ejaculated Wabi for the twentieth time. \"It was an awful\r\njaunt, wasn't it, Muky?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rough--rough like devil th'ough mountains,\" replied Mukoki. \"Not like\r\nthat!\" He swung an arm in the direction of the chasm.\r\n\r\nRod stood silent, open-eyed with wonder. Was it possible that the old\r\nwarrior had discovered a wilder country than that through which he had\r\npassed in the chasm?\r\n\r\n\"She little fall,\" went on Mukoki, brightening as the odor of coffee and\r\nmeat filled his nostrils. \"No bigger than--that!\" He pointed to the roof\r\nof the cabin.\r\n\r\nRod was figuring on the table. Soon he looked up.\r\n\r\n\"According to Mukoki and the map we are at least two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles from the third fall,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMukoki shrugged his shoulders and his face was crinkled in a suggestive\r\ngrimace.\r\n\r\n\"Hudson Bay,\" he grunted.\r\n\r\nWabi turned from his steak in sudden astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't the chasm continue east?\" he almost shouted.\r\n\r\n\"No. She turn--straight north.\"\r\n\r\nRod could not understand the change that came over Wabi's face.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" he said finally, \"if that is the case I can tell you where the\r\ngold is. If the stream in the chasm turns northward it is bound for just\r\none place--the Albany River, and the Albany River empties into James\r\nBay! The third waterfall, where our treasure in gold is waiting for us,\r\nis in the very heart of the wildest and most savage wilderness in North\r\nAmerica. It is safe. No other man has ever found it. But to get it means\r\none of the longest and most adventurous expeditions we ever planned in\r\nall our lives!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Rod. \"Hurrah--\"\r\n\r\nHe had leaped to his feet, forgetful of everything but that their gold\r\nwas safe, and that their search for it would lead them even to the last\r\nfastnesses of the snow-bound and romantic North.\r\n\r\n\"Next spring, Wabi!\" He held out his hand and the two boys joined their\r\npledge in a hearty grip.\r\n\r\n\"Next spring!\" reiterated Wabi.\r\n\r\n\"And we go in canoe,\" joined Mukoki. \"Creek grow bigger. We make\r\nbirch-bark canoe at first fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is better still,\" added Wabi. \"It will be a glorious trip! We'll\r\ntake a little vacation at the third fall and run up to James Bay.\"\r\n\r\n\"James Bay is practically the same as Hudson Bay, isn't it?\" asked Rod.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I could never see a good reason for calling it James Bay. It is in\r\nreality the lower end, or tail, of Hudson Bay.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no thought of visiting any of the traps that day, and the next\r\nmorning Mukoki insisted upon going with Rod, in spite of his four days\r\nof hard travel. If he remained in camp his joints would get stiff, he\r\nsaid, and Wabigoon thought he was right. This left the young Indian to\r\ncare for the trap-line leading into the north.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks of ideal trapping weather now followed. It had been more than\r\ntwo months since the hunters had left Wabinosh House, and Rod now began\r\nto count the days before they would turn back over the homeward trail.\r\nWabi had estimated that they had sixteen hundred dollars' worth of furs\r\nand scalps and two hundred dollars in gold, and the white youth was\r\nsatisfied to return to his mother with his share of six hundred dollars,\r\nwhich was as much as he would have earned in a year at his old position\r\nin the city. Neither did he attempt to conceal from Wabi his desire to\r\nsee Minnetaki; and his Indian friend, thoroughly pleased at Rod's liking\r\nfor his sister, took much pleasure in frequent good-natured banter on\r\nthe subject. In fact, Rod possessed a secret hope that he might induce\r\nthe princess mother to allow her daughter to accompany himself and Wabi\r\nto Detroit, where he knew that his own mother would immediately fall in\r\nlove with the beautiful little maiden from the North.\r\n\r\nIn the third week after the great storm Rod and Mukoki had gone over the\r\nmountain trap-line, leaving Wabi in camp. They had decided that the\r\nfollowing week would see them headed for Wabinosh House, where they\r\nwould arrive about the first of February, and Roderick was in high\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nOn this day they had started toward camp early in the afternoon, and\r\nsoon after they had passed through the swamp Rod expressed his intention\r\nof ascending the ridge, hoping to get a shot at game somewhere along the\r\nmountain trail home. Mukoki, however, decided not to accompany him, but\r\nto take the nearer and easier route.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the mountain Rod paused to take a survey of the country\r\nabout him. He could see Mukoki, now hardly more than a moving speck on\r\nthe edge of the plain; northward the same fascinating, never-ending\r\nwilderness rolled away under his eyes; eastward, two miles away, he saw\r\na moving object which he knew was a moose or a caribou; and westward--\r\n\r\nInstinctively his eyes sought the location of their camp. Instantly the\r\nexpectant light went out of his face. He gave an involuntary cry of\r\nhorror, and there followed it a single, unheard shriek for Mukoki.\r\n\r\nOver the spot where he knew their camp to be now rose a huge volume of\r\nsmoke. The sky was black with it, and in the terrible moment that\r\nfollowed his piercing cry for Mukoki he fancied that he heard the sound\r\nof rifle-shots.\r\n\r\n\"Mukoki! Mukoki!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nThe old Indian was beyond hearing. Quickly it occurred to Rod that early\r\nin their trip they had arranged rifle signals for calling help--two\r\nquick shots, and then, after a moment's interval, three others in rapid\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nHe threw his rifle to his shoulder and fired into the air; once,\r\ntwice--and then three times as fast as he could press the trigger.\r\n\r\nAs he watched Mukoki he reloaded. He saw the Indian pause, turn about\r\nand look back toward the mountain.\r\n\r\nAgain the thrilling signals for help went echoing over the plains. In a\r\nfew seconds the sounds had reached Mukoki's ears and the old warrior\r\ncame swinging back at running speed.\r\n\r\nRod darted along the ridge to meet him, firing a single shot now and\r\nthen to let him know where he was, and in fifteen minutes Mukoki came\r\npanting up the mountain.\r\n\r\n\"The Woongas!\" shouted Rod. \"They've attacked the camp! See!\" He pointed\r\nto the cloud of smoke. \"I heard shots--I heard shots--\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant the grim pathfinder gazed in the direction of the burning\r\ncamp, and then without a word he started at terrific speed down the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nThe half-hour race that followed was one of the most exciting\r\nexperiences of Rod's life. How he kept up with Mukoki was more than he\r\never could explain afterward. But from the time they struck the old\r\ntrail he was close at the Indian's heels. When they reached the hill\r\nthat sheltered the dip his face was scratched and bleeding from contact\r\nwith swinging bushes; his heart seemed ready to burst from its\r\ntremendous exertion; his breath came in an audible hissing, rattling\r\nsound, and he could not speak. But up the hill he plunged behind Mukoki,\r\nhis rifle cocked and ready. At the top they paused.\r\n\r\nThe camp was a smoldering mass of ruins. Not a sign of life was about\r\nit. But--\r\n\r\nWith a gasping, wordless cry Rod caught Mukoki's arm and pointed to an\r\nobject lying in the snow a dozen yards from where the cabin had been.\r\nThe warrior had seen it. He turned one look upon the white youth, and it\r\nwas a look that Rod had never thought could come into the face of a\r\nhuman being. If that was Wabi down there--if Wabi had been killed--what\r\nwould Mukoki's vengeance be! His companion was no longer Mukoki--as he\r\nhad known him; he was the savage. There was no mercy, no human instinct,\r\nno suggestion of the human soul in that one terrible look. If it was\r\nWabi--\r\n\r\nThey plunged down the hill, into the dip, across the lake, and Mukoki\r\nwas on his knees beside the figure in the snow. He turned it over--and\r\nrose without a sound, his battle-glaring eyes peering into the smoking\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nRod looked, and shuddered.\r\n\r\nThe figure in the snow was not Wabi.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange, terrible-looking object--a giant Indian, distorted in\r\ndeath--and a half of his head was shot away!\r\n\r\nWhen he again looked at Mukoki the old Indian was in the midst of the\r\nhot ruins, kicking about with his booted feet and poking with the butt\r\nof his rifle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE RESCUE OF WABIGOON\r\n\r\n\r\nRod had sunk into the snow close to the dead man. His endurance was gone\r\nand he was as weak as a child. He watched every movement Mukoki made;\r\nsaw every start, every glance, and became almost sick with fear whenever\r\nthe warrior bent down to examine some object.\r\n\r\nWas Wabi dead--and burned in those ruins?\r\n\r\nFoot by foot Mukoki searched. His feet became hot; the smell of burning\r\nleather filled his nostrils; glowing coals burned through to his feet.\r\nBut the old Indian was beyond pain. Only two things filled his soul. One\r\nof these was love for Minnetaki; the other was love for Wabigoon. And\r\nthere was only one other thing that could take the place of these, and\r\nthat was merciless, undying, savage passion--passion at any wrong or\r\ninjury that might be done to them. The Woongas had sneaked upon Wabi. He\r\nknew that. They had caught him unaware, like cowards; and perhaps he was\r\ndead--and in those ruins!\r\n\r\nHe searched until his feet were scorched and burned in a score of\r\nplaces, and then he came out, smoke-blackened, but with some of the\r\nterrible look gone out of his face.\r\n\r\n\"He no there!\" he said, speaking for the first time.\r\n\r\nAgain he crouched beside the dead man, and grimaced at Rod with a\r\ntriumphant, gloating chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"Much dead!\" he grinned.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the grimace had gone from his face, and while Rod still\r\nrested he continued his examination of the camp. Close around it the\r\nsnow was beaten down with human tracks. Mukoki saw where the outlaws had\r\nstolen up behind the cabin from the forest and he saw where they had\r\ngone away after the attack.\r\n\r\nFive had come down from the cedars, only four had gone away!\r\n\r\nWhere was Wabi?\r\n\r\nIf he had been captured, and taken with the Indians, there would have\r\nbeen five trails. Rod understood this as well as Mukoki, and he also\r\nunderstood why his companion went back to make another investigation of\r\nthe smoldering ruins. This second search, however, convinced the Indian\r\nthat Wabi's body had not been thrown into the fire. There was only one\r\nconclusion to draw. The youth had made a desperate fight, had killed one\r\nof the outlaws, and after being wounded in the conflict had been carried\r\noff bodily. Wabi and his captors could not be more than two or three\r\nmiles away. A quick pursuit would probably overtake them within an hour.\r\n\r\nMukoki came to Rod's side.\r\n\r\n\"Me follow--kill!\" he said. \"Me kill so many quick!\" He pointed toward\r\nthe four trails. \"You stay--\"\r\n\r\nRod clambered to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"You mean we'll kill 'em, Muky,\" he broke in. \"I can follow you again.\r\nSet the pace!\"\r\n\r\nThere came the click of the safety on Mukoki's rifle, and Rod, following\r\nsuit, cocked his own.\r\n\r\n\"Much quiet,\" whispered the Indian when they had come to the farther\r\nside of the dip. \"No noise--come up still--shoot!\"\r\n\r\nThe snow-shoe trail of the outlaws turned from the dip into the timbered\r\nbottoms to the north, and Mukoki, partly crouched, his rifle always to\r\nthe front, followed swiftly. They had not progressed a hundred yards\r\ninto the plain when the old hunter stopped, a puzzled look in his face.\r\nHe pointed to one of the snow-shoe trails which was much deeper than the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Heem carry Wabi,\" he spoke softly. \"But--\" His eyes gleamed in sudden\r\nexcitement. \"They go slow! They no hurry! Walk very slow! Take much\r\ntime!\"\r\n\r\nRod now observed for the first time that the individual tracks made by\r\nthe outlaws were much shorter than their own, showing that instead of\r\nbeing in haste they were traveling quite slowly. This was a mystery\r\nwhich was not easy to explain. Did the Woongas not fear pursuit? Was it\r\npossible that they believed the hunters would not hasten to give them\r\nbattle? Or were they relying upon the strength of their numbers, or,\r\nperhaps, planning some kind of ambush?\r\n\r\nMukoki's advance now became slower and more cautious. His keen eyes took\r\nin every tree and clump of bushes ahead. Only when he could see the\r\ntrail leading straight away for a considerable distance did he hasten\r\nthe pursuit. Never for an instant did he turn his head to Rod. But\r\nsuddenly he caught sight of something that brought from him a guttural\r\nsound of astonishment. A fifth track had joined the trail! Without\r\nquestioning Rod knew what it meant. Wabi had been lowered from the back\r\nof his captor and was now walking. He was on snow-shoes and his strides\r\nwere quite even and of equal length with the others. Evidently he was\r\nnot badly wounded.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile ahead of them was a high hill and between them and this hill\r\nwas a dense growth of cedar, filled with tangled windfalls. It was an\r\nideal place for an ambush, but the old warrior did not hesitate. The\r\nWoongas had followed a moose trail, with which they were apparently well\r\nacquainted, and in this traveling was easy. But Rod gave an involuntary\r\nshudder as he gazed ahead into the chaotic tangle through which it led.\r\nAt any moment he expected to hear the sharp crack of a rifle and to see\r\nMukoki tumble forward upon his face. Or there might be a fusillade of\r\nshots and he himself might feel the burning sting that comes with rifle\r\ndeath. At the distance from which they would shoot the outlaws could not\r\nmiss. Did not Mukoki realize this? Maddened by the thought that his\r\nbeloved Wabi was in the hands of merciless enemies, was the old\r\npathfinder becoming reckless?\r\n\r\nBut when he looked into his companion's face and saw the cool deadly\r\nresolution glittering in his eyes, the youth's confidence was restored.\r\nFor some reason Mukoki knew that there would not be an ambush.\r\n\r\nOver the moose-run the two traveled more swiftly and soon they came to\r\nthe foot of the high hill. Up this the Woongas had gone, their trail\r\nclearly defined and unswerving in its direction. Mukoki now paused with\r\na warning gesture to Rod, and pointed down at one of the snow-shoe\r\ntracks. The snow was still crumbling and falling about the edges of this\r\nimprint.\r\n\r\n\"Ver' close!\" whispered the Indian.\r\n\r\nIt was not the light of the game hunt in Mukoki's eyes now; there was a\r\ntrembling, terrible tenseness in his whispered words. He crept up the\r\nhill with Rod so near that he could have touched him. At the summit of\r\nthat hill he dragged himself up like an animal, and then, crouching, ran\r\nswiftly to the opposite side, his rifle within six inches of his\r\nshoulder. In the plain below them was unfolded to their eyes a scene\r\nwhich, despite his companion's warning, wrung an exclamation of dismay\r\nfrom Roderick's lips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The leader stopped in his snow-shoes]\r\n\r\nPlainly visible to them in the edge of the plain were the outlaw Woongas\r\nand their captive. They were in single file, with Wabi following the\r\nleader, and the hunters perceived that their comrade's arms were tied\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nBut it was another sight that caused Rod's dismay.\r\n\r\nFrom an opening beside a small lake half a mile beyond the Indians below\r\nthere rose the smoke of two camp-fires, and Mukoki and he could make out\r\nat least a score of figures about these fires.\r\n\r\nWithin rifle-shot of them, almost within shouting distance, there was\r\nnot only the small war party that had attacked the camp, but a third of\r\nthe fighting men of the Woonga tribe! Rod understood their terrible\r\npredicament. To attack the outlaws in an effort to rescue Wabi meant\r\nthat an overwhelming force would be upon them within a few minutes; to\r\nallow Wabi to remain a captive meant--he shuddered at the thought of\r\nwhat it might mean, for he knew of the merciless vengeance of the\r\nWoongas upon the House of Wabinosh.\r\n\r\nAnd while he was thinking of these things the faithful old warrior\r\nbeside him had already formed his plan of attack. He would die with\r\nWabi, gladly--a fighting, terrible slave to devotion to the last; but he\r\nwould not see Wabi die alone. A whispered word, a last look at his\r\nrifle, and Mukoki hurried down into the plains.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill he abandoned the outlaw trail and Rod realized\r\nthat his plan was to sweep swiftly in a semicircle, surprising the\r\nWoongas from the front or side instead of approaching from the rear.\r\nAgain he was taxed to his utmost to keep pace with the avenging Mukoki.\r\nLess than ten minutes later the Indian peered cautiously from behind a\r\nclump of hazel, and then looked back at Rod, a smile of satisfaction on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"They come,\" he breathed, just loud enough to hear. \"They come!\"\r\n\r\nRod peered over his shoulder, and his heart smote mightily within him.\r\nUnconscious of their peril the Woongas were approaching two hundred\r\nyards away. Mukoki gazed into his companion's face and his eyes were\r\nalmost pleading as he laid a bronzed crinkled hand upon the white boy's\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\"You take front man--ahead of Wabi,\" he whispered. \"I take other t'ree.\r\nSee that tree--heem birch, with bark off? Shoot heem there. You no\r\ntremble? You no miss?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Rod. He gripped the red hand in his own. \"I'll kill,\r\nMukoki. I'll kill him dead--in one shot!\"\r\n\r\nThey could hear the voices of the outlaws now, and soon they saw that\r\nWabi's face was disfigured with blood.\r\n\r\nStep by step, slowly and carelessly, the Woongas approached. They were\r\nfifty yards from the marked birch now--forty--thirty--now only ten.\r\nRoderick's rifle was at his shoulder. Already it held a deadly bead on\r\nthe breast of the leader.\r\n\r\nFive yards more--\r\n\r\nThe outlaw passed behind the tree; he came out, and the young hunter\r\npressed the trigger. The leader stopped in his snow-shoes. Even before\r\nhe had crumpled down into a lifeless heap in the snow a furious volley\r\nof shots spat forth from Mukoki's gun, and when Rod swung his own rifle\r\nto join again in the fray he found that only one of the four was\r\nstanding, and he with his hands to his breast as he tottered about to\r\nfall. But from some one of those who had fallen there had gone out a\r\nwild, terrible cry, and even as Rod and Makoki rushed out to free\r\nWabigoon there came an answering yell from the direction of the Woonga\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nMukoki's knife was in his hand by the time he reached Wabi, and with one\r\nor two slashes he had released his hands.\r\n\r\n\"You hurt--bad?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No--no!\" replied Wabi. \"I knew you'd come, boys--dear old friends!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned to the fallen leader and Rod saw him take\r\npossession of the rifle and revolver which he had lost in their fight\r\nwith the Woongas weeks before. Mukoki had already spied their precious\r\npack of furs on one of the outlaw's backs, and he flung it over his own.\r\n\r\n\"You saw the camp?\" queried Wabi excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be upon us in a minute! Which way, Mukoki?\"\r\n\r\n\"The chasm!\" half shouted Rod. \"The chasm! If we can reach the chasm--\"\r\n\r\n\"The chasm!\" reiterated Wabigoon.\r\n\r\nMukoki had fallen behind and motioned for Wabi and Rod to take the lead.\r\nEven now he was determined to take the brunt of danger by bringing up\r\nthe rear.\r\n\r\nThere was no time for argument and Wabigoon set off at a rapid pace.\r\nFrom behind there came the click of shells as the Indian loaded his\r\nrifle on the run. While the other two had been busy at the scene of the\r\nambush Rod had replaced his empty shell, and now, as he led, Wabi\r\nexamined the armament that had been stolen from them by the outlaws.\r\n\r\n\"How many shells have you got, Rod?\" he asked over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-nine.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only four left in this belt besides five in the gun,\" called\r\nback the Indian youth. \"Give me--some.\"\r\n\r\nWithout halting Rod plucked a dozen cartridges from his belt and passed\r\nthem on.\r\n\r\nNow they had reached the hill. At its summit they paused to recover\r\ntheir breath and take a look at the camp.\r\n\r\nThe fires were deserted. A quarter of a mile out on the plain they saw\r\nhalf a dozen of their pursuers speeding toward the hill. The rest were\r\nalready concealed in the nearer thickets of the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"We must beat them to the chasm!\" said the young Indian.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Wabi turned and led the way again.\r\n\r\nRod's heart fell like a lump within him. We must beat them to the chasm!\r\nThose words of Wabi's brought him to the terrible realization that his\r\nown powers of endurance were rapidly ebbing. His race behind Mukoki to\r\nthe burning cabin had seemed to rob the life from the muscles of his\r\nlimbs, and each step now added to his weakness. And the chasm was a mile\r\nbeyond the dip, and the entrance into that chasm still two miles\r\nfarther. Three miles! Could he hold out?\r\n\r\nHe heard Mukoki thumping along behind him; ahead of him Wabi was\r\nunconsciously widening the distance between them. He made a powerful\r\neffort to close the breach, but it was futile. Then from close in his\r\nrear there came a warning halloo from the old Indian, and Wabi turned.\r\n\r\n\"He run t'ree mile to burning cabin,\" said Mukoki. \"He no make chasm!\"\r\n\r\nRod was deathly white and breathing so hard that he could not speak. The\r\nquick-witted Wabi at once realized their situation.\r\n\r\n\"There is just one thing for us to do, Muky. We must stop the Woongas at\r\nthe dip. We'll fire down upon them from the top of the hill beyond the\r\nlake. We can drop three or four of them and they won't dare to come\r\nstraight after us then. They will think we are going to fight them from\r\nthere and will take time to sneak around us. Meanwhile we'll get a good\r\nlead in the direction of the chasm.\"\r\n\r\nHe led off again, this time a little slower. Three minutes later they\r\nentered into the dip, crossed it safely, and were already at the foot of\r\nthe hill, when from the opposite side of the hollow there came a\r\ntriumphant blood-curdling yell.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry!\" shouted Wabi. \"They see us!\" Even as he spoke there came the\r\ncrack of a rifle.\r\n\r\nBzzzzzzz-inggggg!\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life Rod heard that terrible death-song of a\r\nbullet close to his head and saw the snow fly up a dozen feet beyond the\r\nyoung Indian.\r\n\r\nFor an interval of twenty seconds there was silence; then there came\r\nanother shot, and after that three others in quick succession. Wabi\r\nstumbled.\r\n\r\n\"Not hit!\" he called, scrambling to his feet. \"Confound--that rock!\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to the hilltop with Rod close behind him, and from the opposite\r\nside of the lake there came a fusillade of half a dozen shots.\r\nInstinctively Rod dropped upon his face. And in that instant, as he lay\r\nin the snow, he heard the sickening thud of a bullet and a sharp sudden\r\ncry of pain from Mukoki. But the old warrior came up beside him and they\r\npassed into the shelter of the hilltop together.\r\n\r\n\"Is it bad? Is it bad, Mukoki? Is it bad--\" Wabi was almost sobbing as\r\nhe turned and threw an arm around the old Indian. \"Are you hit--bad?\"\r\n\r\nMukoki staggered, but caught himself.\r\n\r\n\"In here,\" he said, putting a hand to his left shoulder. \"She--no--bad.\"\r\nHe smiled, courage gleaming with pain in his eyes, and swung off the\r\nlight pack of furs. \"We give 'em--devil--here!\"\r\n\r\nCrouching, they peered over the edge of the hill. Half a dozen Woongas\r\nhad already left the cedars and were following swiftly across the open.\r\nOthers broke from the cover, and Wabi saw that a number of them were\r\nwithout snow-shoes. He exultantly drew Mukoki's attention to this fact,\r\nbut the latter did not lift his eyes. In a few moments he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Now we give 'em--devil!\"\r\n\r\nEight pursuers on snow-shoes were in the open of the dip. Six of them\r\nhad reached the lake. Rod held his fire. He knew that it was now more\r\nimportant for him to recover his wind than to fight, and he drew great\r\ndrafts of air into his lungs while his two comrades leveled their\r\nrifles. He could fire after they were done if it was necessary.\r\n\r\nThere was slow deadly deliberation in the way Mukoki and Wabigoon\r\nsighted along their rifle-barrels. Mukoki fired first; one shot,\r\ntwo--with a second's interval between--and an outlaw half-way across the\r\nlake pitched forward into the snow. As he fell, Wabi fired once, and\r\nthere came to their ears shriek after shriek of agony as a second\r\npursuer fell with a shattered leg. At the cries and shots of battle the\r\nhot blood rushed through Rod's veins, and with an excited shout of\r\ndefiance he brought his rifle to his shoulder and in unison the three\r\nguns sent fire and death into the dip below.\r\n\r\nOnly three of the eight Woongas remained and they had turned and were\r\nrunning toward the shelter of the cedars.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Rod.\r\n\r\nIn his excitement he got upon his feet and sent his fifth and last shot\r\nafter the fleeing outlaws. \"Hurrah! Wow! Let's go after 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get down!\" commanded Wabi. \"Load in a hurry!\"\r\n\r\nClink--clink--clink sounded the new shells as Mukoki and Wabigoon thrust\r\nthem into their magazines. Five seconds more and they were sending a\r\nterrific fusillade of shots into the edge of the cedars--ten in all--and\r\nby the time he had reloaded his own gun Rod could see nothing to shoot\r\nat.\r\n\r\n\"That will hold them for a while,\" spoke Wabi. \"Most of them came in too\r\nbig a hurry, and without their snow-shoes, Muky. We'll beat them to the\r\nchasm--easy!\" He put an arm around the shoulders of the old Indian, who\r\nwas still lying upon his face in the snow. \"Let me see, Muky--let me\r\nsee--\"\r\n\r\n\"Chasm first,\" replied Mukoki. \"She no bad. No hit bone. No\r\nbleed--much.\"\r\n\r\nFrom behind Rod could see that Mukoki's coat was showing a growing\r\nblotch of red.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure--you can reach the chasm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nIn proof of his assertion the wounded Indian rose to his feet and\r\napproached the pack of furs. Wabi was ahead of him, and placed it upon\r\nhis own shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"You and Rod lead the way,\" he said. \"You two know where to find the\r\nopening into the chasm. I've never been there.\"\r\n\r\nMukoki started down the hill, and Rod, close behind, could hear him\r\nbreathing heavily; there was no longer fear for himself in his soul, but\r\nfor that grim faithful warrior ahead, who would die in his tracks\r\nwithout a murmur and with a smile of triumph and fearlessness on his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nRODERICK HOLDS THE WOONGAS AT BAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThey traveled more slowly now and Rod found his strength returning. When\r\nthey reached the second ridge he took Mukoki by the arm and assisted him\r\nup, and the old Indian made no demur. This spoke more strongly of his\r\nhurt than words. There was still no sign of their enemies behind. From\r\nthe top of the second ridge they could look back upon a quarter of a\r\nmile of the valley below, and it was here that Rod suggested that he\r\nremain on watch for a few minutes while Wabigoon went on with Mukoki.\r\nThe young hunters could see that the Indian was becoming weaker at every\r\nstep, and Mukoki could no longer conceal this weakness in spite of the\r\ntremendous efforts he made to appear natural.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it is bad,\" whispered Wabi to Rod, his face strangely white.\r\n\"I believe it is worse than we think. He is bleeding hard. Your idea is\r\na good one. Watch here, and if the Woongas show up in the valley open\r\nfire on them. I'll leave you my gun, too, so they'll think we are going\r\nto give them another fight. That will keep them back for a time. I'm\r\ngoing to stop Muky up here a little way and dress his wound. He will\r\nbleed to death if I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then go on,\" added Rod. \"Don't stop if you hear me fire, but hurry\r\non to the chasm. I know the way and will join you. I'm as strong as I\r\never was now, and can catch up with you easily with Mukoki traveling as\r\nslowly as he does.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this brief conversation Mukoki had continued his way along the\r\nridge and Wabi hurried to overtake him. Meanwhile Rod concealed himself\r\nbehind a rock, from which vantage-point he could see the whole of that\r\npart of the valley across which they had come.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch and in tense anxiety counted every minute after\r\nthat. He allowed ten minutes for the dressing of Mukoki's wound. Every\r\nsecond gained from then on would be priceless. For a quarter of an hour\r\nhe kept his eyes with ceaseless vigilance upon their back trail. Surely\r\nthe Woongas had secured their snow-shoes by this time! Was it possible\r\nthat they had given up the pursuit--that their terrible experience in\r\nthe dip had made them afraid of further battle? Rod answered this\r\nquestion in the negative. He was sure that the Woongas knew that Wabi\r\nwas the son of the factor of Wabinosh House. Therefore they would make\r\nevery effort to recapture him, even though they had to follow far and a\r\ndozen lives were lost before that feat was accomplished.\r\n\r\nA movement in the snow across the valley caught Rod's eyes. He\r\nstraightened himself, and his breath came quickly. Two figures had\r\nappeared in the open. Another followed close behind, and after that\r\nthere came others, until the waiting youth had counted sixteen. They\r\nwere all on snow-shoes, following swiftly over the trail of the\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\nThe young hunter looked at his watch again. Twenty-five minutes had\r\npassed. Mukoki and Wabigoon had secured a good start. If he could only\r\nhold the outlaws in the valley for a quarter of an hour more--just\r\nfifteen short minutes--they would almost have reached the entrance into\r\nthe chasm.\r\n\r\nAlone, with his own life and those of his comrades depending upon him,\r\nthe boy was cool. There was no tremble in his hands to destroy the\r\naccuracy of his rifle-fire, no blurring excitement or fear in his brain\r\nto trouble his judgment of distance and range. He made up his mind that\r\nhe would not fire until they had come within four hundred yards. Between\r\nthat distance and three hundred he was sure he could drop at least one\r\nor two of them.\r\n\r\nHe measured his range by a jackpine stub, and when two of the Woongas\r\nhad reached and passed that stub he fired. He saw the snow thrown up six\r\nfeet in front of the leader. He fired again, and again, and one of the\r\nshots, a little high, struck the second outlaw. The leader had darted\r\nback to the shelter of the stub and Rod sent another bullet whizzing\r\npast his ears. His fifth he turned into the main body of the pursuers,\r\nand then, catching up Wabi's rifle, he poured a hail of five bullets\r\namong them in as many seconds.\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous. The outlaws scattered in retreat and Rod\r\nsaw that a second figure was lying motionless in the snow. He began to\r\nreload his rifles and by the time he had finished the Woongas had\r\nseparated and were running to the right and the left of him. For the\r\nlast time he looked at his watch. Wabi and Mukoki had been gone\r\nthirty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe boy crept back from his rock, straightened himself, and followed in\r\ntheir trail. He mentally calculated that it would be ten minutes before\r\nthe Woongas, coming up from the sides and rear, would discover his\r\nflight, and by that time he would have nearly a mile the start of them.\r\nHe saw, without stopping, where Wabi had dressed Mukoki's wound. There\r\nwere spots of blood and a red rag upon the snow. Half a mile farther on\r\nthe two had paused again, and this time he knew that Mukoki had stopped\r\nto rest. From now on they had rested every quarter of a mile or so, and\r\nsoon Roderick saw them toiling slowly through the snow ahead of him.\r\n\r\nHe ran up, panting, anxious.\r\n\r\n\"How--\" he began.\r\n\r\nWabi looked at him grimly.\r\n\r\n\"How much farther, Rod?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not more than half a mile.\"\r\n\r\nWabi motioned for him to take Mukoki's other arm.\r\n\r\n\"He has bled a good deal,\" he said. There was a hardness in his voice\r\nthat made Rod shudder, and he caught his breath as Wabi shot him a\r\nmeaning glance behind the old warrior's doubled shoulders.\r\n\r\nThey went faster now, almost carrying their wounded comrade between\r\nthem. Suddenly, Wabi paused, threw his rifle to his shoulder, and fired.\r\nA few yards ahead a huge white rabbit kicked in his death struggles in\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\n\"If we do reach the chasm Mukoki must have something to eat,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We'll reach it!\" gasped Rod. \"We'll reach it! There's the woods. We go\r\ndown there!\"\r\n\r\nThey almost ran, with Mukoki's snow-shod feet dragging between them, and\r\nfive minutes later they were carrying the half-unconscious Indian down\r\nthe steep side of the mountain. At its foot Wabi turned, and his eyes\r\nflashed with vengeful hatred.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you devils!\" he shouted up defiantly. \"Now!\"\r\n\r\nMukoki aroused himself for a few moments and Rod helped him back to the\r\nshelter of the chasm wall. He found a nook between great masses of rock,\r\nalmost clear of snow, and left him there while he hurried back to\r\nWabigoon.\r\n\r\n\"You stand on guard here, Rod,\" said the latter. \"We must cook that\r\nrabbit and get some life back into Mukoki. I think he has stopped\r\nbleeding, but I am going to look again. The wound isn't fatal, but it\r\nhas weakened him. If we can get something hot into him I believe he will\r\nbe able to walk again. Did you have anything left over from your dinner\r\non the trail to-day?\"\r\n\r\nRod unstrapped the small pack in which the hunters carried their food\r\nwhile on the trail, and which had been upon his shoulders since noon.\r\n\r\n\"There is a double handful of coffee, a cupful of tea, plenty of salt\r\nand a little bread,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good! Few enough supplies for three people in this kind of a\r\nwilderness--but they'll save Mukoki!\"\r\n\r\nWabi went back, while Rod, sheltered behind a rock, watched the narrow\r\nincline into the chasm. He almost hoped the Woongas would dare to\r\nattempt a descent, for he was sure that he and Wabi would have them at a\r\nterrible disadvantage and with their revolvers and three rifles could\r\ninflict a decisive blow upon them before they reached the bottom. But he\r\nsaw no sign of their enemies. He heard no sound from above, yet he knew\r\nthat the outlaws were very near--only waiting for the protecting\r\ndarkness of night.\r\n\r\nHe heard the crackling of Wabi's fire and the odor of coffee came to\r\nhim; and Wabi, assured that their presence was known to the Woongas,\r\nbegan whistling cheerily. In a few minutes he rejoined Rod behind the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n\"They will attack us as soon as it gets good and dark,\" he said coolly.\r\n\"That is, if they can find us. As soon as they are no longer able to see\r\ndown into the chasm we will find some kind of a hiding-place. Mukoki\r\nwill be able to travel then.\"\r\n\r\nA memory of the cleft in the chasm wall came to Rod and he quickly\r\ndescribed it to his companion. It was an ideal hiding-place at night,\r\nand if Mukoki was strong enough they could steal up out of the chasm and\r\nsecure a long start into the south before the Woongas discovered their\r\nflight in the morning. There was just one chance of failure. If the spy\r\nwhose trail had revealed the break in the mountain to Rod was not among\r\nthe outlaws' wounded or dead the cleft might be guarded, or the Woongas\r\nthemselves might employ it in making a descent upon them.\r\n\r\n\"It's worth the risk anyway,\" said Wabi. \"The chances are even that your\r\noutlaw ran across the fissure by accident and that his companions are\r\nnot aware of its existence. And they'll not follow our trail down the\r\nchasm to-night, I'll wager. In the cover of darkness they will steal\r\ndown among the rocks and then wait for daylight. Meanwhile we can be\r\ntraveling southward and when they catch up with us we will give them\r\nanother fight if they want it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can start pretty soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Within an hour.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time the two stood in silent watchfulness. Suddenly Rod asked:\r\n\r\n\"Where is Wolf?\"\r\n\r\nWabi laughed, softly, exultantly.\r\n\r\n\"Gone back to his people, Rod. He will be crying in the wild hunt-pack\r\nto-night. Good old Wolf!\" The laugh left his lips and there was a\r\ntremble of regret in his voice. \"The Woongas came from the back of the\r\ncabin--took me by surprise--and we had it hot and heavy for a few\r\nminutes. We fell back where Wolf was tied and just as I knew they'd got\r\nme sure I cut his babeesh with the knife I had in my hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't he show fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"For a minute. Then one of the Indians shot, at him and he hiked off\r\ninto the woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Queer they didn't wait for Mukoki and me,\" mused Rod. \"Why didn't they\r\nambush us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they didn't want you, and they were sure they'd reach their\r\ncamp before you took up the trail. I was their prize. With me in their\r\npower they figured on communicating with you and Mukoki and sending you\r\nback to the Post with their terms. They would have bled father to his\r\nlast cent--and then killed me. Oh, they talked pretty plainly to me when\r\nthey thought they had me!\"\r\n\r\nThere came a noise from above them and the young hunters held their\r\nrifles in readiness. Nearer and nearer came the crashing sound, until a\r\nsmall boulder shot past them into the chasm.\r\n\r\n\"They're up there,\" grinned Wabi, lowering his gun. \"That was an\r\naccident, but you'd better keep your eyes open. I'll bet the whole tribe\r\nfeel like murdering the fellow who rolled over that stone!\"\r\n\r\nHe crept cautiously back to Mukoki, and Rod crouched with his face to\r\nthe narrow trail leading down from the top of the mountain. Deep shadows\r\nwere beginning to lurk among the trees and he was determined that any\r\nmovement there would draw his fire. Fifteen minutes later Wabi returned,\r\neating ravenously at a big hind quarter of broiled rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"I've had my coffee,\" he greeted. \"Go back and eat and drink, and build\r\nthe fire up high. Don't mind me when I shoot. I am going to fire just to\r\nlet the Woongas know we are on guard, and after that we'll hustle for\r\nthat break in the mountain.\"\r\n\r\nRod found Mukoki with a chunk of rabbit in one hand and a cup of coffee\r\nin the other. The wounded Indian smiled with something like the old\r\nlight in his eyes and a mighty load was lifted from Rod's heart.\r\n\r\n\"You're better?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" replied Mukoki. \"No much hurt. Good fight some more. Wabi say,\r\n'No, you stay.'\" His face became a map of grimaces to show his\r\ndisapproval of Wabi's command.\r\n\r\nRod helped himself to the meat and coffee. He was hungry, but after he\r\nwas done there remained some of the rabbit and a biscuit and these he\r\nplaced in his pack for further use. Soon after this there came two shots\r\nfrom the rock and before the echoes had died away down the chasm Wabi\r\napproached through the gathering gloom.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for the hunters to steal along the concealment of the\r\nmountain wall, and even if there had been prying eyes on the opposite\r\nridge they could not have penetrated the thickening darkness in the\r\nbottom of the gulch. For some time the flight was continued with extreme\r\ncaution, no sound being made to arouse the suspicion of any outlaw who\r\nmight be patrolling the edge of the precipice. At the end of half an\r\nhour Mukoki, who was in the lead that he might set a pace according to\r\nhis strength, quickened his steps. Rod was close beside him now, his\r\neyes ceaselessly searching the chasm wall for signs that would tell him\r\nwhen they were nearing the rift. Suddenly Wabi halted in his tracks and\r\ngave a low hiss that stopped them.\r\n\r\n\"It's snowing!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nMukoki lifted his face. Great solitary flakes of snow fell upon it.\r\n\r\n\"She snow hard--soon. Mebby cover snow-shoe trails!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if it does--we're safe!\" There was a vibrant joy in Wabi's voice.\r\n\r\nFor a full minute Mukoki held his face to the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Hear small wind over chasm,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"She come from south. She snow hard--now--up there!\"\r\n\r\nThey went on, stirred by new hope. Rod could feel that the flakes were\r\ncoming thicker. The three now kept close to the chasm wall in their\r\nsearch for the rift. How changed all things were at night! Rod's heart\r\nthrobbed now with hope, now with doubt, now with actual fear. Was it\r\npossible that he could not find it? Had they passed it among some of the\r\nblack shadows behind? He saw no rock that he recognized, no overhanging\r\ncrag, no sign to guide him. He stopped, and his voice betrayed his\r\nuneasiness as he asked:\r\n\r\n\"How far do you think we have come?\"\r\n\r\nMukoki had gone a few steps ahead, and before Wabi answered he called\r\nsoftly to them from close up against the chasm wall. They hurried to him\r\nand found him standing beside the rift.\r\n\r\n\"Here!\"\r\n\r\nWabi handed his rifle to Rod.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going up first,\" he announced. \"If the coast is clear I'll whistle\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Mukoki and Rod could hear him as he crawled up the\r\nfissure. Then all was silent. A quarter of an hour passed, and a low\r\nwhistle came to their ears. Another ten minutes and the three stood\r\ntogether at the top of the mountain, Rod and the wounded Mukoki\r\nbreathing hard from their exertions.\r\n\r\nFor a time the three sat down in the snow and waited, watched, listened;\r\nand from Rod's heart there went up something that was almost a prayer,\r\nfor it was snowing--snowing hard, and it seemed to him that the storm\r\nwas something which God had specially directed should fall in their path\r\nthat it might shield them and bring them safely home.\r\n\r\nAnd when he rose to his feet Wabi was still silent, and the three\r\ngripped hands in mute thankfulness at their deliverance.\r\n\r\nStill speechless, they turned instinctively for a moment back to the\r\ndark desolation beyond the chasm--the great, white wilderness in which\r\nthey had passed so many adventurous yet happy weeks; and as they gazed\r\ninto the chaos beyond the second mountain there came to them the lonely,\r\nwailing howl of a wolf.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Wabi softly. \"I wonder--if that--is Wolf?\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, Indian file, they trailed into the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE SURPRISE AT THE POST\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that the adventurers turned their backs upon the Woonga\r\ncountry Mukoki was in command. With the storm in their favor everything\r\nelse now depended upon the craft of the old pathfinder. There was\r\nneither moon nor wind to guide them, and even Wabi felt that he was not\r\ncompetent to strike a straight trail in a strange country and a night\r\nstorm. But Mukoki, still a savage in the ways of the wilderness, seemed\r\npossessed of that mysterious sixth sense which is known as the sense of\r\norientation--that almost supernatural instinct which guides the carrier\r\npigeon as straight as a die to its home-cote hundreds of miles away.\r\nAgain and again during that thrilling night's flight Wabi or Rod would\r\nask the Indian where Wabinosh House lay, and he would point out its\r\ndirection to them without hesitation. And each time it seemed to the\r\ncity youth that he pointed a different way, and it proved to him how\r\neasy it was to become hopelessly lost in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nNot until midnight did they pause to rest. They had traveled slowly but\r\nsteadily and Wabi figured that they had covered fifteen miles. Five\r\nmiles behind them their trail was completely obliterated by the falling\r\nsnow. Morning would betray to the Woongas no sign of the direction taken\r\nby the fugitives.\r\n\r\n\"They will believe that we have struck directly westward for the Post,\"\r\nsaid Wabi. \"To-morrow night we'll be fifty miles apart.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this stop a small fire was built behind a fallen log and the\r\nhunters refreshed themselves with a pot of strong coffee and what little\r\nremained of the rabbit and biscuits. The march was then resumed.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Rod that they had climbed an interminable number of ridges\r\nand had picked their way through an interminable number of swampy\r\nbottoms between them, and he, even more than Mukoki, was relieved when\r\nthey struck the easier traveling of open plains. In fact, Mukoki seemed\r\nscarcely to give a thought to his wound and Roderick was almost ready to\r\ndrop in his tracks by the time a halt was called an hour before dawn.\r\nThe old warrior was confident that they were now well out of danger and\r\na rousing camp-fire was built in the shelter of a thick growth of\r\nspruce.\r\n\r\n\"Spruce partridge in mornin',\" affirmed Mukoki. \"Plenty here for\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" asked Rod, whose hunger was ravenous.\r\n\r\n\"Fine thick spruce, all in shelter of dip,\" explained the Indian. \"Birds\r\nwinter here.\"\r\n\r\nWabi had unpacked the furs, and the larger of these, including six lynx\r\nand three especially fine wolf skins, he divided into three piles.\r\n\r\n\"They'll make mighty comfortable beds if you keep close enough to the\r\nfire,\" he explained. \"Get a few spruce boughs, Rod, and cover them over\r\nwith one of the wolf skins. The two lynx pelts will make the warmest\r\nblankets you ever had.\"\r\n\r\nRod quickly availed himself of this idea, and within half an hour he was\r\nsleeping soundly. Mukoki and Wabigoon, more inured to the hardships of\r\nthe wilderness, took only brief snatches of slumber, one or both\r\nawakening now and then to replenish the fire. As soon as it was light\r\nenough the two Indians went quietly out into the spruce with their guns,\r\nand their shots a little later awakened Rod. When they returned they\r\nbrought three partridges with them.\r\n\r\n\"There are dozens of them among the spruce,\" said Wabi, \"but just now we\r\ndo not want to shoot any oftener than is absolutely necessary. Have you\r\nnoticed our last night's trail?\"\r\n\r\nRod rubbed his eyes, thus confessing that as yet he had not been out\r\nfrom between his furs.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you go out there in the open for a hundred yards you won't\r\nfind it,\" finished his comrade. \"The snow has covered it completely.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough they lacked everything but meat, this breakfast in the spruce\r\nthicket was one of the happiest of the entire trip, and when the three\r\nhunters were done each had eaten of his partridge until only the bones\r\nwere left. There was now little cause for fear, for it was still snowing\r\nand their enemies were twenty-five miles to the north of them. This fact\r\ndid not deter the adventurers from securing an early start, however, and\r\nthey traveled southward through the storm until noon, when they built a\r\ncamp of spruce and made preparations to rest until the following day.\r\n\r\n\"We must be somewhere near the Kenogami trail,\" Wabi remarked to Mukoki.\r\n\"We may have passed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No pass it,\" replied Mukoki. \"She off there.\" He pointed to the south.\r\n\r\n\"You see the Kenogami trail is a sled trail leading from the little town\r\nof Nipigon, on the railroad, to Kenogami House, which is a Hudson Bay\r\nPost at the upper end of Long Lake,\" explained Wabi to his white\r\ncompanion. \"The factor of Kenogami is a great friend of ours and we have\r\nvisited back and forth often, but I've been over the Kenogami trail only\r\nonce. Mukoki has traveled it many times.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral rabbits were killed before dinner. No other hunting was done\r\nduring the afternoon, most of which was passed in sleep by the exhausted\r\nadventurers. When Rod awoke he found that it had stopped snowing and was\r\nnearly dark.\r\n\r\nMukoki's wound was beginning to trouble him again, and it was decided\r\nthat at least a part of the next day should be passed in camp, and that\r\nboth Rod and Wabigoon should make an effort to kill some animal that\r\nwould furnish them with the proper kind of oil to dress it with, the fat\r\nof almost any species of animal except mink or rabbit being valuable for\r\nthis purpose. With dawn the two started out, while Mukoki, much against\r\nhis will, was induced to remain in camp. A short distance away the\r\nhunters separated, Rod striking to the eastward and Wabi into the south.\r\n\r\nFor an hour Roderick continued without seeing game, though there were\r\nplenty of signs of deer and caribou about him. At last he determined to\r\nstrike for a ridge a mile to the south, from the top of which he was\r\nmore likely to get a shot than in the thick growth of the plains. He had\r\nnot traversed more than a half of the distance when much to his surprise\r\nhe came upon a well-beaten trail running slightly diagonally with his\r\nown, almost due north. Two dog-teams had passed since yesterday's storm,\r\nand on either side of the sleds were the snow-shoe trails of men. Rod\r\nsaw that there were three of these, and at least a dozen dogs in the two\r\nteams. It at once occurred to him that this was the Kenogami trail, and\r\nimpelled by nothing more than curiosity he began to follow it.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile farther on he found where the party had stopped to cook a\r\nmeal. The remains of their camp-fire lay beside a huge log, which was\r\npartly burned away, and about it were scattered bones and bits of bread.\r\nBut what most attracted Rod's attention were other tracks which joined\r\nthose of the three people on snow-shoes. He was sure that these tracks\r\nhad been made by women, for the footprints made by one of them were\r\nunusually small. Close to the log he found a single impression in the\r\nsnow that caused his heart to give a sudden unexpected thump within him.\r\nIn this spot the snow had been packed by one of the snow-shoes, and in\r\nthis comparatively hard surface the footprint was clearly defined. It\r\nhad been made by a moccasin. Rod knew that. And the moccasin wore a\r\nslight heel! He remembered, now, that thrilling day in the forest near\r\nWabinosh House when he had stopped to look at Minnetaki's footprints in\r\nthe soft earth through which she had been driven by her Woonga\r\nabductors, and he remembered, too, that she was the only person at the\r\nPost who wore heels on her moccasins. It was a queer coincidence! Could\r\nMinnetaki have been here? Had she made that footprint in the snow?\r\nImpossible, declared the young hunter's better sense. And yet his blood\r\nran a little faster as he touched the delicate impression with his bare\r\nfingers. It reminded him of Minnetaki, anyway; her foot would have made\r\njust such a trail, and he wondered if the girl who had stepped there was\r\nas pretty as she.\r\n\r\nHe followed now a little faster than before, and ten minutes later he\r\ncame to where a dozen snow-shoe trails had come in from the north and\r\nhad joined the three. After meeting, the two parties had evidently\r\njoined forces and had departed over the trail made by those who had\r\nappeared from the direction of the Post.\r\n\r\n\"Friends from Kenogami House came down to meet them,\" mused Rod, and as\r\nhe turned back in the direction of the camp he formed a picture of that\r\nmeeting in the heart of the wilderness, of the glad embraces of husband\r\nand wife, and the joy of the pretty girl with the tiny feet as she\r\nkissed her father, and perhaps her big brother; for no girl could\r\npossess feet just like Minnetaki's and not be pretty!\r\n\r\nHe found that Wabi had preceded him when he returned. The young Indian\r\nhad shot a small doe, and that noon witnessed a feast in camp. For his\r\nlack of luck Rod had his story to tell of the people on the trail. The\r\npassing of this party formed the chief topic of conversation during the\r\nrest of the day, for after weeks of isolation in the wilderness even\r\nthis momentary nearness of living civilized men and women was a great\r\nevent to them. But there was one fact which Rod dwelt but slightly upon.\r\nHe did not emphasize the similarity of the pretty footprint and that\r\nmade by Minnetaki's moccasin, for he knew that a betrayal of his\r\nknowledge and admiration of the Indian maiden's feet would furnish Wabi\r\nwith fun-making ammunition for a week. He did say, however, that the\r\nfootprint in the snow struck him as being just about the size that\r\nMinnetaki would make.\r\n\r\nAll that day and night the hunters remained in camp, sleeping, eating\r\nand taking care of Mukoki's wound, but the next morning saw them ready\r\nfor their homeward journey with the coming of dawn. They struck due\r\nwestward now, satisfied that they were well beyond the range of the\r\noutlaw Woongas.\r\n\r\nAs the boys talked over their adventure on the long journey back toward\r\nthe Post, Wabi thought with regret of the moose head which he had left\r\nburied in the \"Indian ice-box,\" and even wished, for a moment, to go\r\nhome by the northern trail, despite the danger from the hostile Woongas,\r\nin order to recover the valuable antlers. But Mukoki shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Woonga make good fight. What for go again into wolf trap?\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they reluctantly gave up the notion of carrying the big head of\r\nthe bull moose back to the Post.\r\n\r\nA little before noon of the second day they saw Lake Nipigon from the\r\ntop of a hill. Columbus when he first stepped upon the shore of his\r\nnewly discovered land was not a whit happier than Roderick Drew when\r\nthat joyous youth, running out upon the snow-covered ice, attempted to\r\nturn a somersault with his snow-shoes on!\r\n\r\nJust over there, thought Rod--just over there--a hundred miles or so, is\r\nMinnetaki and the Post! Happy visions filled his mind all that afternoon\r\nas they traveled across the foot of the lake. Three weeks more and he\r\nwould see his mother--and home. And Wabi was going with him! He seemed\r\ntireless; his spirits were never exhausted; he laughed, whistled, even\r\nattempted to sing. He wondered if Minnetaki would be very glad to see\r\nhim. He knew that she would be glad--but how glad?\r\n\r\nTwo days more were spent in circling the lower end of the lake. Then\r\ntheir trail turned northward, and on the second evening after this, as\r\nthe cold red sun was sinking in all that heatless glory of the great\r\nNorth's day-end, they came out upon a forest-clad ridge and looked down\r\nupon the House of Wabinosh.\r\n\r\nAnd as they looked--and as the burning disk of the sun, falling down and\r\ndown behind forest, mountain and plain, bade its last adieu to the land\r\nof the wild, there came to them, strangely clear and beautiful, the\r\nnotes of a bugle.\r\n\r\nAnd Wabi, listening, grew rigid with wonder. As the last notes died away\r\nthe cheers that had been close to his lips gave way to the question,\r\n\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"A bugle!\" said Rod.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there came to their ears the heavy, reverberating boom of a\r\nbig gun.\r\n\r\n\"If I'm not mistaken,\" he added, \"that is a sunset salute. I didn't know\r\nyou had--soldiers--at the Post!\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't,\" replied the Indian youth. \"By George, what do you suppose\r\nit means?\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried down the ridge, the others close behind him. Fifteen minutes\r\nlater they trailed out into the open near the Post. A strange change had\r\noccurred since Rod and his companions had last seen Wabinosh House. In\r\nthe open half a dozen rude log shelters had been erected, and about\r\nthese were scores of soldiers in the uniform of his Majesty, the King of\r\nEngland. Shouts of greeting died on the hunters' lips. They hastened to\r\nthe dwelling of the factor, and while Wabi rushed in to meet his mother\r\nand father Rod cut across to the Company's store. He had often found\r\nMinnetaki there. But his present hope was shattered, and after looking\r\nin he turned back to the house. By the time he had reached the steps a\r\nsecond time the princess mother, with Wabi close behind her, came out to\r\nwelcome him.\r\n\r\nWabi's face was flushed with excitement. His eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\"Rod, what do you think!\" he exclaimed, after his mother had gone back\r\nto see to the preparation of their supper. \"The government has declared\r\nwar on the Woongas and has sent up a company of regulars to wipe 'em out!\r\nThey have been murdering and robbing as never before during the last two\r\nmonths. The regulars start after them to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nHe was breathing hard and excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you stay--and join in the campaign?\" he pleaded.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" replied Rod. \"I can't, Wabi; I've got to go home. You know\r\nthat. And you're going with me. The regulars can get along without you.\r\nGo back to Detroit with me--and get your mother to let Minnetaki go with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now, Rod,\" said the Indian youth, taking his friend's hand. \"I\r\nwon't be able to go--now. Nor Minnetaki either. They have been having\r\nsuch desperate times here that father has sent her away. He wanted\r\nmother to go, but she wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent Minnetaki away?\" gasped Rod.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She started for Kenogami House four days ago in company with an\r\nIndian woman and three guides. That was undoubtedly their trail you\r\nfound.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the footprint--\"\r\n\r\n\"Was hers,\" laughed Wabi, putting an arm affectionately around his\r\nchum's shoulders. \"Won't you stay, Rod?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to his old room, and until suppertime sat alone in silent\r\ndejection. Two great disappointments had fallen upon him. Wabi could not\r\ngo home with him--and he had missed Minnetaki. The young girl had left a\r\nnote in her mother's care for him, and he read it again and again. She\r\nhad written it believing that she would return to Wabinosh House before\r\nthe hunters, but at the end she had added a paragraph in which she said\r\nthat if she did not do this Rod must make the Post a second visit very\r\nsoon, and bring his mother with him.\r\n\r\nAt supper the princess mother several times pressed Minnetaki's\r\ninvitation upon the young hunter. She read to him parts of certain\r\nletters which she had received from Mrs. Drew during the winter, and Rod\r\nwas overjoyed to find that his mother was not only in good health, but\r\nthat she had given her promise to visit Wabinosh House the following\r\nsummer. Wabi broke all table etiquette by giving vent to a warlike whoop\r\nof joy at this announcement, and once more Rod's spirits rose high above\r\nhis temporary disappointments.\r\n\r\nThat night the furs were appraised and purchased by the factor for his\r\nCompany, and Rod's share, including his third of the gold, was nearly\r\nseven hundred dollars. The next morning the bi-monthly sled party, was\r\nleaving for civilization, and he prepared to go with it, after writing a\r\nlong letter to Minnetaki, which was to be carried to her by the faithful\r\nMukoki. Most of that night Wabi and his friend sat up and talked, and\r\nmade plans. It was believed that the campaign against the Woongas would\r\nbe a short and decisive one. By spring all trouble would be over.\r\n\r\n\"And you'll come back as soon as you can?\" pleaded Wabi for the\r\nhundredth time. \"You'll come back by the time the ice breaks up?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am alive!\" pledged the city youth.\r\n\r\n\"And you'll bring your mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then--for the gold!\"\r\n\r\n\"For the gold!\"\r\n\r\nWabi held out his hand and the two gripped heartily.\r\n\r\n\"And Minnetaki will be here then--I swear it!\" said the Indian youth,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nRod blushed.\r\n\r\nAnd that night alone he slipped quietly out into the still, white night;\r\nand he looked, longingly, far into the southeast where he had found the\r\nfootprint in the snow; and he turned to the north, and the east, and the\r\nwest, and lastly to the south, and his eyes seemed to travel through the\r\ndistance of a thousand miles to where a home and a mother lay sleeping\r\nin a great city. And as he turned back to the House of Wabinosh, where\r\nall the lights were out, he spoke softly to himself:\r\n\r\n\"It's home--to-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he added:\r\n\r\n\"But you bet I'll be back by the time the ice breaks up!\"\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Wolf Hunters, by James Oliver Curwood",
