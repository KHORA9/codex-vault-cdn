I take that\r\nof Gïzeh as being the one affording most data, and as being probably one\r\nof the most important groups.\r\n\r\nI shall first try to set forth the results of my investigations into the\r\npeculiarities of construction of the Gïzeh Group, and afterwards show\r\nhow the Pyramids were applied to the national work for which I believe\r\nthey were designed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. THE GROUND PLAN OF THE GIZEH GROUP.\r\n\r\nI find that the Pyramid Cheops is situated on the acute angle of a\r\nright-angled triangle--sometimes called the Pythagorean, or Egyptian\r\ntriangle--of which base, perpendicular, and hypotenuse are to each other\r\nas 3, 4, and 5. The Pyramid called Mycerinus, is situate on the greater\r\nangle of this triangle, and the base of the triangle, measuring _three_,\r\nis a line due east from Mycerinus, and joining perpendicular at a point\r\ndue south of Cheops. (_See Figure 1._)\r\n\r\n    Fig. 1. Cheops, Mycerinus\r\n\r\nI find that the Pyramid Cheops is also situate at the acute angle of a\r\nright-angled triangle more beautiful than the so-called triangle of\r\nPythagoras, because more practically useful. I have named it the 20, 21,\r\n29 triangle. Base, perpendicular, and hypotenuse are to each other as\r\ntwenty, twenty-one, and twenty-nine.\r\n\r\nThe Pyramid Cephren is situate on the greater angle of this triangle,\r\nand base and perpendicular are as before described in the Pythagorean\r\ntriangle upon which Mycerinus is built. (_See Fig. 2._)\r\n\r\n    Fig. 2. Cheops, Cephren\r\n\r\n    Fig. 3. Cheops, Cephren, Mycerinus\r\n\r\n_Figure 3_ represents the combination,--A being Cheops, F Cephren, and D\r\nMycerinus.\r\n\r\nLines DC, CA, and AD are to each other as 3, 4, and 5; and lines FB,\r\nBA, and AF are to each other as 20, 21, and 29.\r\n\r\nThe line CB is to BA, as 8 to 7; the line FH is to DH, as 96 to 55; and\r\nthe line FB is to BC, as 5 to 6.\r\n\r\nThe Ratios of the first triangle multiplied by forty-five, of the second\r\nmultiplied by four, and the other three sets by twelve, one, and sixteen\r\nrespectively, produce the following connected lengths in natural numbers\r\nfor all the lines.\r\n\r\n    DC      135\r\n    CA      180\r\n    AD      225\r\n    -----------\r\n    FB       80\r\n    BA       84\r\n    AF      116\r\n    -----------\r\n    CB       96\r\n    BA       84\r\n    -----------\r\n    FH       96\r\n    DH       55\r\n    -----------\r\n    FB       80\r\n    BC       96\r\n\r\nFigure 4 connects another pyramid of the group--it is the one to the\r\nsouthward and eastward of Cheops.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, A Y Z A is a 3, 4, 5 triangle, and B Y Z O B is a\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n    Lines YA to CA are as  1 to 5\r\n          CY to YZ     as  3 to 1\r\n          FO to ZO     as  8 to 3\r\n    and   DA to AZ     as 15 to 4.\r\n\r\nI may also point out on the same plan that calling the line FA radius,\r\nand the lines BA and FB sine and co-sine, then is YA equal in length to\r\nversed sine of angle AFB.\r\n\r\nThis connects the 20, 21, 29 triangle FAB with the 3, 4, 5 triangle AZY.\r\n\r\nI have not sufficient data at my disposal to enable me to connect the\r\nremaining eleven small pyramids to my satisfaction, and I consider the\r\nfour are sufficient for my purpose.\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 4._\r\n\r\n                                           _At level of_  _At level of_\r\n                                            _Own base_   _Cephren's base_\r\n\r\n    _Of these natural_   }   _Cheops_          56½       52½\r\n    _numbers the bases_  } = _Cephren_         52½       52½\r\n    _of the pyramids are_}   _Mycerinus_       26¼       27¼\r\n    _as follows._        }\r\n\r\n\r\nI now establish the following list of measurements of the plan in\r\nconnected natural numbers.

Wild, in his letter to Lord Brougham written in 1850, called\r\nthe base of Cephren seven seconds. I estimate the base of Cephren to be\r\njust seven thirtieths of the line DA. The line DA is therefore thirty\r\nseconds of the Earth's Polar circumference. The line DA is therefore\r\n3033·118625 British feet, and the base of Cephren 707·727 British feet.\r\n\r\nI applied a variety of Cubits but found none to work in _without\r\nfractions_ on the beautiful set of natural dimensions which I had worked\r\nout for my plan. (_See table of connected natural numbers._)\r\n\r\nI ultimately arrived at a cubit as the ancient measure which I have\r\ncalled the R.B. cubit, because it closely resembles the Royal Babylonian\r\nCubit of ·5131 metre, or 1·683399 British feet. The difference is 1/600\r\nof a foot.\r\n\r\nI arrived at the R.B. cubit in the following manner.\r\n\r\nTaking the polar axis of the earth at five hundred million\r\ngeometric inches, thirty seconds of the circumference will be\r\n36361·02608--geometric inches, or 36397·4235 British inches, at nine\r\nhundred and ninety-nine to the thousand--and 3030·0855 geometric\r\nfeet, or 3033·118625 British feet. Now dividing a second into sixty\r\nparts, there are 1800 R.B. cubits in the line DA; and the line DA\r\nbeing thirty seconds, measures 36397·4235 British inches, which\r\ndivided by 1800 makes one of my cubits 20·2207908 British inches, or\r\n1·685066 British feet. Similarly, 36361·02608 geometric inches\r\ndivided by 1800 makes my cubit 20·20057 geometric inches in length.\r\nI have therefore defined this cubit as follows:--One R.B. cubit is\r\nequal to 20.2006 geo. inches, 20·2208 Brit. inches, and 1·685 Brit.\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nI now construct the following table of measures.\r\n\r\n    +---------+----------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n    |  R.

According to this measure, the Gïzeh plan would be about 1/1011\r\nsmaller than if measured by R.B. cubits.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. THE EXACT MEASURE OF THE BASES OF THE PYRAMIDS.\r\n\r\nA stadium being 360 R.B. cubits, or six seconds--and a plethron 60 R.B.\r\ncubits, or one second, the base of the Pyramid Cephren is seven plethra,\r\nor a stadium and a plethron, equal to seven seconds, or four hundred and\r\ntwenty R.B. cubits.\r\n\r\nMycerinus' base is acknowledged to be half the base of Cephren.\r\n\r\nPiazzi Smyth makes the base of the Pyramid Cheops 9131·05 pyramid (or\r\ngeometric) inches, which divided by 20·2006 gives 452·01 R.B. cubits. I\r\ncall it 452 cubits, and accept it as the measure which exactly fits the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nI have not sufficient data to determine the exact base of the other and\r\nsmaller pyramid which I have marked on my plan.\r\n\r\nThe bases, then, of Mycerinus, Cephren, and Cheops, are 210, 420 and 452\r\ncubits, respectively.\r\n\r\nBut in plan the bases should be reduced to one level. I have therefore\r\ndrawn my plan, or horizontal section, at the level or plane of the base\r\nof Cephren, at which level or plane the bases or horizontal sections of\r\nthe pyramids are--Mycerinus, 218 cubits, Cephren, 420 cubits, and\r\nCheops, 420 cubits. I shall show how I arrive at this by-and-by, and\r\nshall also show that the horizontal section of Cheops, corresponding to\r\nthe horizontal section of Cephren at the level of Cephren's base,\r\noccurs, as it should do, at the level of one of the courses of masonry,\r\nviz.--the top of the tenth course.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. THE SLOPES, RATIOS, AND ANGLES OF THE THREE PRINCIPAL PYRAMIDS OF\r\nTHE GIZEH GROUP.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the description of the exact slopes and angles of the\r\nthree principal pyramids, I must premise that I was guided to my\r\nconclusions by making full use of the combined evolutions of the two\r\nwonderful right-angled triangles, 3, 4, 5, and 20, 21, 29, which seem to\r\nrun through the whole design as a sort of dominant.\r\n\r\nFrom the first I was firmly convinced that in such skilful workmanship\r\nsome very simple and easily applied templates must have been employed,\r\nand so it turned out. Builders do not mark a dimension on a plan which\r\nthey cannot measure, nor have a hidden measure of any importance without\r\nsome clear outer way of establishing it.\r\n\r\nThis made me \"go straight\" for the slant ratios. When the Pyramids were\r\ncased from top to bottom with polished marble, there were only two\r\nfeasible measures, the bases and the apothems;[1] and for that reason I\r\nconjectured that these would be the definite plan ratios.\r\n\r\n    Footnote 1: The \"_Apothem_ is a perpendicular from the vertex of a\r\n    pyramid on a side of the base.\"--_Chambers' Practical Mathematics, p.\r\n    156._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFigures 6, 7 and 8 show the _exact_ slope ratios of Cheops, Cephren, and\r\nMycerinus, measured as shown on the diagrams--viz., Cheops, 21 to 34,\r\nCephren, 20 to 33, and Mycerinus, 20 to 32--that is, half base to\r\napothem.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 6 Cheops.            _Note.

For the sake of comparison, it will be well to call these\r\nratios 330 to 210, 320 to 210, and 336 to 210, respectively.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Fig. 9.

The ratio of Sir F. James, half diagonal 10 to\r\naltitude 9 is also very nearly correct.\r\n\r\nMy altitude for Cheops is 484·887 British feet, and the half base 380·81\r\nBritish feet.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of 7 to 5½ gives 484·66, and the ratio of 233 to 183 gives\r\n484·85 for the altitude.\r\n\r\nMy half diagonal is 538·5465, and ratio 10 to 9, gives 484·69 British\r\nfeet for the altitude.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the above to show how very nearly these ratios agree\r\nwith my exact ratio of 21 to 34 half base to apothem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Fig. 11.

J. Wild's measure, by not quite one of my cubits.\r\n\r\nIn my angles I agree very nearly with Piazzi Smyth, for Cheops, and with\r\nAgnew, for Cephren, differing about half a degree from Agnew, for\r\nMycerinus, who took this pyramid to represent the same relation of [Pi]\r\nthat P. Smyth ascribes to Cheops (viz.: 51° 51′ 14·″3), while he gave\r\nCheops about the same angle which I ascribe to Mycerinus.\r\n\r\nI shall now show how I make Cephren and Cheops of equal bases of 420\r\nR.B. cubits at the same level, viz.--that of Cephren's base.\r\n\r\nJohn James Wild made the bases of Cheops, Cephren, and Mycerinus,\r\nrespectively, 80, 100, and 104·90 cubits above some point that he called\r\nNile Level.\r\n\r\nHis cubit was, I believe, the Memphis, or Nilometric cubit--but at any\r\nrate, he made the base of Cephren 412 of them.\r\n\r\nI therefore divided the recognized base of Cephren--viz., 707·75 British\r\nfeet--by 412, and got a result of 1·7178 British feet for his cubit.\r\nTherefore, his measures multiplied by 1·7178 and divided by 1·685 will\r\nturn his cubits into R.B. cubits.\r\n\r\nI thus make Cheops, Cephren, and Mycerinus, respectively, 81·56,\r\n101·93, and 106·93 R.B. cubits above the datum that J. J. Wild calls\r\nNile Level. According to Bonwick's \"Facts and Fancies,\" p. 31, high\r\nwater Nile would be 138½ ft. below base of Cheops (or 82·19 R.B.\r\ncubits).\r\n\r\nPiazzi Smyth makes the pavement of Cheops 1752 British inches (or 86·64\r\nR.B. cubits) above _average Nile Level_, but, by scaling his map, his\r\n_high Nile Level_ appears to agree nearly with Wild.\r\n\r\nIt is the _relative levels_ of the Pyramids, however, that I require, no\r\nmatter how much above Nile Level.\r\n\r\nCephren's base of 420 cubits being 101·93 cubits, and Cheops' base of\r\n452 cubits being 81·56 cubits above Wild's datum, the difference in\r\nlevel of their bases is, 20·37 cubits.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of base to altitude of Cheops being 330 to 210, therefore\r\n20·37 cubits divided by 210 and multiplied by 330 equals 32 cubits; and\r\n452 cubits minus 32 cubits, equals 420.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the base of Mycerinus is 5 cubits _above_ the base of\r\nCephren, and the ratio of base to altitude 32 to 20; therefore, 5 cubits\r\ndivided by 20 and multiplied by 32 equals 8 cubits to be _added_ to the\r\n210 cubit base of Mycerinus, making it 218 cubits in breadth at the\r\nlevel of Cephren's base.\r\n\r\nThus, a horizontal section or plan at the level of Cephren's base would\r\nmeet the slopes of the Pyramids so that they would on plan appear as\r\nsquares with sides equal to 218, 420, and 420 R.B. cubits, for\r\nMycerinus, Cephren, and Cheops, respectively.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 21.\r\n                                       R.B.

My calculation of 269·80 R.B. cub. (See Fig. 21) is equal to\r\n5450 pyramid inches--this is about 18 cubits below the theoretical apex.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFigure 21 represents the comparative levels and dimensions of Mycerinus,\r\nCephren, and Cheops.\r\n\r\nThe following peculiarities are noticeable:--That Cheops and Cephren are\r\nof equal bases at the level of Cephren's base;--that, at the level of\r\nCheops' base, the latter is only half a cubit larger;--that, from the\r\nlevel of Mycerinus' base, Cheops is just double the height of\r\nMycerinus;--and that from the level of Cephren's base, Cephren is just\r\ndouble the height of Mycerinus; measuring in the latter case, however,\r\nonly up to the level platform at the summit of Cephren, which is said to\r\nbe about eight feet wide.\r\n\r\nThe present summit of Cephren is 23·07 cubits above the present summit\r\nof Cheops, and the completed apex of Cephren would be 8·21 cubits above\r\nthe completed apex of Cheops.\r\n\r\nIn the summit platforms I have been guided by P.

AREA OF THE BASE.\r\n\r\n    Mycerinus      70560·                   44100\r\n    Cephren       291060·                  176400\r\n    Cheops        330777·90                204304\r\n\r\n              All in R.B. cubits.\r\n\r\n    Therefore--32  :  20  : :   70560·    :  44100\r\n               33  :  20  : :  291060·    : 176400\r\n               34  :  21  : :  330777·90  : 204304\r\n\r\n[2]Herodotus states that \"_the area of each of the four faces of Cheops\r\nwas equal to the area of a square whose base was the altitude of a\r\nPyramid;_\" or, in other words, that altitude was a mean proportional to\r\napothem and half base; thus--area of one face equals the fourth of\r\n330777·90 or 82694·475 R.B. cubits, and the square root of 82694·475 is\r\n287·56. But the correct altitude is 287·77, so the error is 0·21, or\r\n4¼ British inches. I have therefore the authority of Herodotus to\r\nsupport the theory which I shall subsequently set forth, that this\r\npyramid was the exponent of lines divided in mean and extreme ratio.\r\n\r\nBy taking the dimensions of the Pyramid from what I may call its\r\n_working level_, that is, the level of the base of Cephren, this\r\npeculiarity shows more clearly, as also others to which I shall refer.\r\nThus--base of Cheops at working level, 420 cubits, and apothem 340\r\ncubits; base area is, therefore, 176400 cubits, and area of one face is\r\n(420 cubits, multiplied by half apothem, or 170 cubits) 71400 cubits.\r\nNow the square root of 71400 would give altitude, or side of square\r\nequal to altitude, 267·207784 cubits: but the real altitude is\r\n√(340²-210²) = √71500 = 267·394839. So that the error of Herodotus's\r\nproposition is the difference between √714 and √715.\r\n\r\n    Footnote 2: Proctor is responsible for this statement, as I am\r\n    quoting from an essay of his in the _Gentleman's Magazine_. R. B.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a consideration of the properties of the angle formed by\r\nthe ratio _apothem_ 34 to _half base_ 21, peculiar to the pyramid\r\nCheops. (_See Figure 22._)\r\n\r\nFig. 22. Diagram illustrating relations of ratios of the pyramid Cheops.\r\n\r\nCalling apothem 34, _radius_; and half base 21, _sine_--I find that--\r\n\r\n    Radius is the square root of   1156\r\n    Sine                            441\r\n    Co-sine                         715\r\n    Tangent                         713\r\n    Secant                         1869\r\n    and Co-versed-sine              169\r\n\r\nSo it follows that the area of one of the faces, 714, is a mean between\r\nthe square of the altitude or co-sine, 715, and the square of the\r\ntangent, 713.\r\n\r\nThus the reader will notice that the peculiarities of the Pyramid\r\nCheops lie in the regular relations of the _squares_ of its various\r\nlines; while the peculiarities of the other two pyramids lie in the\r\nrelations of the lines themselves.\r\n\r\nMycerinus and Cephren, born, as one may say, of those two noble\r\ntriangles 3, 4, 5, and 20, 21, 29, exhibit in their lineal developments\r\nratios so nearly perfect that, for all practical purposes, they may be\r\ncalled correct.\r\n\r\n    Thus--Mycerinus, [3]20² +  25² =   1025, and  32² =   1024.\r\n    and Cephren,     [4]80² + 105² =  17425, and 132² =  17424.\r\n    or              [5]400² + 431² = 345761, and 588² = 345744.\r\n\r\nSee diagrams, Figures 11 to 14 inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn the Pyramid Cheops, altitude is _very nearly_ a mean proportional\r\nbetween apothem and half base. Apothem being 34, and half base 21, then\r\naltitude would be √(34²-21²) = √715 = 26·7394839, and--\r\n\r\n    21 : 26·7394839 :: 26·7394839 : 34, nearly.\r\n\r\nHere, of course, the same difference comes in as occurred in\r\nconsidering the assumption of Herodotus, viz., the difference\r\nbetween √715 and √714; because if the altitude were √714, then would\r\nit be _exactly_ a mean proportional between the half base and the\r\napothem; (thus, 21 : 26·72077 :: 26·72077 :: 34.)\r\n\r\n    Footnote 3: Half base to altitude.\r\n\r\n    Footnote 4: Half base to altitude.\r\n\r\n    Footnote 5: Half diagonal of base to altitude.\r\n\r\nIn Cheops, the ratios of apothem, half base and edge are, 34, 21, and\r\n40, very nearly, thus, 34² + 21² = 1597, and 40² = 1600.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of Cheops (from the level of the base of Cephren) to be\r\nwhat Piazzi Smyth calls a [Pi] pyramid, would be--\r\n\r\n    Half base 210              R.B. cubits.\r\n    Altitude  267·380304, &c.      \"\r\n    Apothem   339·988573, &c.      \"\r\n\r\nAltitude being to perimeter of base, as radius of a circle to\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nMy dimensions of the pyramid therefore in which--\r\n\r\n    Half base = 210             R.B. cubits.\r\n    Altitude  = 267·394839 &c.      \"\r\n    Apothem   = 340                 \"\r\n\r\ncome about as near to the ratio of [Pi] as it is possible to come, and\r\nprovide simple lines and templates to the workmen in constructing the\r\nbuilding; and I entertain no doubt that on the simple lines and\r\ntemplates that my ratios provide, were these three pyramids built.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6A. THE CASING STONES OF THE PYRAMIDS.\r\n\r\nFigures 23, 24, and 25, represent ordinary casing stones of the three\r\npyramids, and Figures 26, 27, and 28, represent angle or quoin casing\r\nstones of the same.\r\n\r\nThe casing stone of Cheops, found by Colonel Vyse, is represented in\r\nBonwick's \"Pyramid Facts and Fancies,\" page 16, as measuring four feet\r\nthree inches at the top, eight feet three inches at the bottom, four\r\nfeet eleven inches at the back, and six feet three inches at the\r\nfront. Taking four feet eleven inches as _Radius_, and six feet three\r\ninches as _Secant_, then the _Tangent_ is three feet ten inches and\r\nthree tenths.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 23. Cheops Casing Stone.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 24. Cephren Casing Stone.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 25. Mycerinus Casing Stone.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 26. Cheops Angle or Quoin Stone.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 27. Cephren Angle or Quoin Stone.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 28. Mycerinus Angle or Quoin Stone.\r\n\r\nThus, in inches (√(75²-59²)) = 46·30 inches; therefore the inclination\r\nof the stone must have been--slant height 75 inches to 46·30 inches\r\nhorizontal. Now, 46·30 is to 75, as 21 is to 34. Therefore, Col. Vyse's\r\ncasing stone agrees exactly with my ratio for the Pyramid Cheops, viz.,\r\n21 to 34. (_See Figure 29._)\r\n\r\n    Fig. 29. =Col. Vyse's Casing Stone.= 75 : 46·3 :: 34 : 21\r\n\r\nThis stone must have been out of plumb at the back an inch and seven\r\ntenths; perhaps to give room for grouting the back joint of the marble\r\ncasing stone to the limestone body of the work: or, because, as it is\r\nnot a necessity in good masonry that the back of a stone should be\r\nexactly plumb, so long as the error is on the right side, the builders\r\nmight not have been particular in that respect.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 59. (Temple of Cheops, standing at angle of wall.)\r\n\r\nFigure 59 represents such a template as the masons would have used in\r\nbuilding Cheops, both for dressing and setting the stones. (The courses\r\nare drawn out of proportion to the template.) The other pyramids must\r\nhave been built by the aid of similar templates.\r\n\r\nSuch large blocks of stone as were used in the casing of these pyramids\r\ncould not have been completely dressed before setting; the back and\r\nends, and the top and bottom beds were probably dressed off truly, and\r\nthe face roughly scabbled off; but the true slope angle could not have\r\nbeen dressed off until the stone had been truly set and bedded,\r\notherwise there would have been great danger to the sharp arises.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall now record the peculiarities of the 3, 4, 5 or Pythagorean\r\ntriangle, and the right-angled triangle 20, 21, 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7.

Figure 31 shows the 3·1\r\ntriangle, and the 2·1 triangle built up on the sine and co-sine of the\r\n3, 4, 5 triangle.\r\n\r\nThe 3·1 triangle contains 18° 26′ 5·82″ and the 2·1 triangle\r\n26° 33′ 54·19″; the latter has been frequently noticed as a\r\npyramid angle in the gallery inclinations.\r\n\r\nFigure 32 shows these two triangles combined with the 3, 4, 5 triangle,\r\non the circumference of a circle.\r\n\r\n    Footnote 6: 60 = 3 × 4 × 5\r\n\r\nThe 20, 21, 29 triangle contains 43° 36′ 10·15″ and the\r\ncomplement, 46° 23′ 49·85″.\r\n\r\nExpressed in whole numbers--\r\n\r\n    Radius         29  =  12180[7]\r\n    Sine           20  =   8400\r\n    Co-sine        21  =   8820\r\n    Versed sine     8  =   3360\r\n    Co-versed sine  9  =   3780\r\n    Tangent            =  11600\r\n    Co-tangent         =  12789\r\n    Secant             =  16820\r\n    Co-sec             =  17661\r\n\r\n    Tangent + Secant = 2⅓ radius\r\n    Co-tan  + Co-sec = 2½ radius\r\n    Sine : Versed sine :: 5 : 2\r\n    Co-sine : Co-versed sine :: 7 : 3\r\n\r\n    Footnote 7: 12180 = 20 × 21 × 29\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that while the multiplier required to bring radius 5\r\nand the rest into whole numbers, for the 3, 4, 5 triangle is twelve, in\r\nthe 20, 21, 29 triangle it is 420, the key measure for the bases of the\r\ntwo main pyramids in R.B. cubits.[8]\r\n\r\n    Footnote 8: 12 = 3 × 4, and 420 = 20 × 21\r\n\r\nI am led to believe from study of the plan, and consideration of the\r\nwhole numbers in this 20, 21, 29 triangle, that the R.B. cubit, like the\r\nMemphis cubit, was divided into 280 parts.\r\n\r\nThe whole numbers of radius, sine, and co-sine divided by 280, give a\r\nvery pretty measure and series in R.B. cubits, viz., 43½, 30, and\r\n31½, or 87, 60, and 63, or 174, 120 and 126;--all exceedingly useful\r\nin right-angled measurements. Notice that the right-angled triangle 174,\r\n120, 126, in the sum of its sides _amounts to_ 420.\r\n\r\nFigure 33 illustrates the 20, 21, 29 triangle.

Ratios of Leading Triangles.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that in the details of the building of the Pyramids\r\nof Gïzeh there are traces of other measures than R. B. cubits, but that\r\nthe original cubit of the plan was 1·685 British feet I feel no doubt.\r\nIt is a perfect and beautiful measure, fit for such a noble design, and,\r\nrepresenting as it does the sixtieth part of a second of the Earth's\r\npolar circumference, it is and was a measure for all time.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that these ancient geometricians could not have been\r\naware of the measure of the Earth's circumference; and wisely so, were\r\nit not for two distinct answers that arise. The first being, that since\r\nI think I have shown that Pythagoras never discovered the Pythagorean\r\ntriangle, but that it must have been known and practically employed\r\nthousands of years before his era, in the Egyptian Colleges where he\r\nobtained his M.A. degree, so in the same way it is probable that\r\nEratosthenes, when he went to work to prove that the earth's\r\ncircumference was fifty times the distance from Syene to Alexandria, may\r\nhave obtained the idea from his ready access to the ill-fated\r\nAlexandrian Library, in which perhaps some record of the learning of the\r\nbuilders of the Pyramids was stored. And therefore I claim that there is\r\nno reason why the pyramid builders should not have known as much about\r\nthe circumference of the earth as the modern world that has calmly stood\r\nby in its ignorance and permitted those magnificent and, as I shall\r\nprove, useful edifices to be stripped of their beautiful garments of\r\npolished marble.\r\n\r\nMy second answer is that the correct cubit measure may have been got by\r\nits inventors in a variety of other ways; for instance, by observations\r\nof shadows of heavenly bodies, without any knowledge even that the earth\r\nwas round; or it may have been evolved like the British inch, which Sir\r\nJohn Herschel tells us is within a thousandth part of being one five\r\nhundred millionth of the earth's polar axis. I doubt if the\r\ncircumference of the earth was considered by the inventor of the British\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiarity of the Hindoo mathematicians that they tried to\r\nmake out that all they knew was _very old_. Modern savants appear to\r\ntake the opposite stand for any little information they happen to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe cubit which is called the Royal Babylonian cubit and stated to\r\nmeasure O·5131 metre, differs so slightly from my cubit, only the\r\nsix-hundredth part of a foot, that it may fairly be said to be the same\r\ncubit, and it will be for antiquaries to trace the connection, as this\r\nmay throw some light on the identity of the builders of the Pyramids of\r\nGïzeh. Few good English two-foot rules agree better than these two\r\ncubits do.\r\n\r\nWhile I was groping about in the dark searching for this bright needle,\r\nI tried on the plan many likely ancient measures.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I worked in Memphis or Nilometric cubits, which I made\r\n1·7126 British feet; they seem to vary from 1·70 to 1·72, and although I\r\nmade good use of them in identifying other people's measures, still they\r\nwere evidently not in accordance with the design; but the R.B. cubit of\r\n1·685 British feet works as truly into the plan of the Pyramids _without\r\nfractions_ as it does into the circumference of the earth.\r\n\r\nHere I might, to prevent others from falling into one of my errors,\r\npoint out a rock on which I was aground for a long time. I took the base\r\nof the Pyramid Cheops, determined by Piazzi Smyth, from Bonwick's\r\n\"Pyramid Facts and Fancies\" (a valuable little reference book), as\r\n763.81 British feet, and the altitude as 486.2567; and then from Piazzi\r\nSmyth's \"Inheritance,\" page 27, I confirmed these figures, and so worked\r\non them for a long time, but found always a great flaw in my work, and\r\nat last adopted a fresh base for Cheops, feeling sure that Mr. Smyth's\r\nbase was wrong: for I was absolutely grounded in my conviction that at a\r\ncertain level, Cheops' and Cephren's measures bore certain relations to\r\neach other. I subsequently found in another part of Mr. Smyth's book,\r\nthat the correct measures were 761.65 and 484.91 British feet for base\r\nand altitude, which were exactly what I wanted, and enabled me to be in\r\naccordance with him in that pyramid which he appears to have made his\r\nparticular study.\r\n\r\nFor the information of those who may wish to compare my measures, which\r\nare the results of an even or regular circumference without fractions,\r\nwith Mr. Smyth's measures, which are the results of an even or regular\r\ndiameter without fractions, it may be well to state that there are just\r\nabout 99 R.B. cubits in 80 of Piazzi Smyth's cubits of 25 pyramid inches\r\neach.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT, THE THEODOLITES OF THE EGYPTIAN LAND\r\nSURVEYORS.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-three years ago, on my road to Australia, I was crossing\r\nfrom Alexandria to Cairo, and saw the pyramids of Gïzeh.\r\n\r\nI watched them carefully as the train passed along, noticed their clear\r\ncut lines against the sky, and their constantly changing relative\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nI then felt a strong conviction that they were built for at least one\r\nuseful purpose, and that purpose was the survey of the country. I said,\r\n\"Here be the Theodolites of the Egyptians.\"\r\n\r\nBuilt by scientific men, well versed in geometry, but unacquainted with\r\nthe use of glass lenses, these great stone monuments are so suited in\r\nshape for the purposes of land surveying, that the practical engineer or\r\nsurveyor must, after consideration, admit that they may have been built\r\nmainly for that purpose.\r\n\r\nNot only might the country have been surveyed by these great\r\ninstruments, and the land allotted at periodical times to the people;\r\nbut they, remaining always in one position, were there to correct and\r\nreadjust boundaries destroyed or confused by the annual inundations of\r\nthe Nile.\r\n\r\nThe Pyramids of Egypt may be considered as a great system of landmarks\r\nfor the establishment and easy readjustment at any time of the\r\nboundaries of the holdings of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Pyramids of Gïzeh appear to have been main marks; and those of\r\nAbousir, Sakkârah, Dashow, Lisht, Meydoun, &c., with the great pyramids\r\nin Lake Moeris, subordinate marks, in this system, which was probably\r\nextended from Chaldea through Egypt into Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nThe pyramid builders may perhaps have made the entombment of their Kings\r\none of their exoteric objects, playing on the morbid vanity of their\r\nrulers to induce them to the work, but in the minds of the builders\r\nbefore ever they built must have been planted the intention to make use\r\nof the structures for the purposes of land surveying.\r\n\r\nThe land of Egypt was valuable and maintained a dense population; every\r\nyear it was mostly submerged, and the boundaries destroyed or confused.\r\nEvery soldier had six to twelve acres of land; the priests had their\r\nslice of the land too; after every war a reallotment of the lands must\r\nhave taken place, perhaps every year.\r\n\r\nWhile the water was lying on the land, it so softened the ground that\r\nthe stone boundary marks must have required frequent readjustment, as\r\nthey would have been likely to fall on one side.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of their great stone theodolites, the surveyors, who\r\nbelonged to the priestly order, were able to readjust the boundaries\r\nwith great precision. That all science was comprised in their secret\r\nmysteries may be one reason why no hieroglyphic record of the scientific\r\nuses of the pyramids remains. It is possible that at the time of\r\nDiodorus and Herodotus, (and even when Pythagoras visited Egypt,)\r\ntheology may have so smothered science, that the uses of the pyramids\r\nmay have been forgotten by the very priests to whom in former times the\r\nknowledge belonged; but \"a respectful reticence\" which has been noticed\r\nin some of these old writers on pyramid and other priestly matters would\r\nrather lead us to believe that an initiation into the mysteries may have\r\nsealed their lips on subjects about which they might otherwise have been\r\nmore explicit.\r\n\r\nThe \"_closing_\" of one pyramid over another in bringing any of their\r\nmany lines into true order, must even now be very perfect;--but now we\r\ncan only imagine the beauties of these great instrumental wonders of the\r\nworld when the casing stones were on them. We can picture the rosy\r\nlights of one, and the bright white lights of others; their clear cut\r\nlines against the sky, true as the hairs of a theodolite; and the sombre\r\ndarkness of the contrasting shades, bringing out their angles with\r\nstartling distinctness. Under the influence of the Eastern sun, the\r\nfaces must have been a very blaze of light, and could have been seen at\r\nenormous distances like great mirrors.\r\n\r\nI declare that the pyramids of Gïzeh in all their polished glory,\r\nbefore the destroyer stripped them of their beautiful garments, were in\r\nevery respect adapted to flash around clearly defined lines of sight,\r\nupon which the lands of the nation could be accurately threaded. The\r\nvery thought of these mighty theodolites of the old Egyptians fills me\r\nwith wonder and reverence. What perfect and beautiful instruments they\r\nwere! never out of adjustment, always correct, always ready; no magnetic\r\ndeviation to allow for. No wonder they took the trouble they did to\r\nbuild them so correctly in their so marvellously suitable positions.\r\n\r\nIf Astronomers agree that observations of a pole star could have been\r\naccurately made by peering up a small gallery on the north side of one\r\nof the pyramids only a few hundred feet in length, I feel that I shall\r\nhave little difficulty in satisfying them that accurate measurements to\r\npoints only _miles_ away could have been made from angular observations\r\nof the whole group.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. HOW THE PYRAMIDS WERE MADE USE OF.\r\n\r\nIt appears from what I have already set forth that the plan of the\r\nPyramids under consideration is geometrically exact, a perfect set of\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nI shall now show how these edifices were applied to a thoroughly\r\ngeometrical purpose in the true meaning of the word--to measure the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nI shall show how true straight lines could be extended from the Pyramids\r\nin given directions useful in right-angled trigonometry, by direct\r\nobservation of the buildings, and without the aid of other instruments.\r\n\r\nAnd I shall show how by the aid of a simple instrument angles could be\r\nexactly observed from any point.\r\n\r\nThis Survey theory does not stand or fall on the merits of my theory of\r\nthe Gïzeh plan. Let it be proved that this group is not built on the\r\nexact system of triangulation set forth by me, it is still a fact that\r\nits plan is in a similar shape, and any such shape would enable a\r\nsurveyor acquainted with the plan to lay down accurate surveys by\r\nobservations of the group even should it not occupy the precise lines\r\nassumed by me.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must state that although the lines of the plan as laid down\r\nherein agree nearly with the lines as laid down in Piazzi Smyth's book,\r\nin the Penny Cyclopædia, and in an essay of Proctor's in the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, still I find that they do not agree at all\r\nsatisfactorily with a map of the Pyramids in Sharp's \"Egypt,\" said to be\r\ncopied from Wilkinson's map.\r\n\r\nWe will, however, for the time, and to explain my survey theory, suppose\r\nthe plan theory to be correct, as I firmly believe it is.\r\n\r\nAnd then, supposing it may be proved that the respective positions of\r\nthe pyramids are slightly different to those that I have allotted to\r\nthem on my plan, it will only make a similar slight difference to the\r\nlines and angles which I shall here show could be laid out by their aid.\r\n\r\nLet us in the first place comprehend clearly the shape of the land of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nA sector or fan, with a long handle--the fan or sector, the delta; and\r\nthe handle of the fan, the Nile Valley, running nearly due south.\r\n\r\nThe Pyramids of Gïzeh are situate at the angle of the sector, on a rocky\r\neminence whence they can all be seen for many miles. The summits of the\r\ntwo high ones can be seen from the delta, and from the Nile Valley to a\r\nvery great distance; how far, I am unable to say; but I should think\r\nthat while the group could be made general use of for a radius of\r\nfifteen miles, the summits of Cephren and Cheops could be made use of\r\nfor a distance of thirty miles; taking into consideration the general\r\nfall of the country.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that if meridian observations of the star Alpha of\r\nthe Dragon could be made with accuracy by peeping up a small hole in one\r\nof the pyramids, then surely might the surveyors have carried true north\r\nand south lines up the Nile Valley as far as the summit of Cheops was\r\nvisible, by \"_plumbing in_\" the star and the apex of the pyramid by the\r\naid of a string and a stone.\r\n\r\nTrue east and west lines could have been made to intersect such north\r\nand south lines from the various groups of pyramids along the river\r\nbanks, by whose aid also such lines would be prolonged.\r\n\r\nNext, supposing that their astronomers had been aware of the latitude of\r\nCheops, and the annual northing and southing of the sun, straight lines\r\ncould have been laid out in various sectoral directions to the\r\nnorth-eastward and north-westward of Cheops, across the delta, as far as\r\nthe extreme apex of the pyramid was visible, by observations of the sun,\r\nrising or setting over his summit. (That the Dog-star was observed in\r\nthis manner from the north-west, I have little doubt.)\r\n\r\n    Fig. 37. Sun above Pyramid and sinking behind Pyramid\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, surveyors would be stationed at suitable distances\r\napart with their strings and their stones, ready to catch the sun\r\nsimultaneously, and at the very moment he became transfixed upon the\r\napex of the pyramid, and was, as it were, \"swallowed by it.\" (_See\r\nFigure 37_.) The knowledge of the pyramid slope angle from different\r\npoints of view would enable the surveyor to place himself in readiness\r\nnearly on the line.\r\n\r\nSurely such lines as these would be as true and as perfect as we could\r\nlay out nowadays with all our modern instrumental appliances. A string\r\nand a stone here, a clean-cut point of stone twenty miles away, and a\r\ngreat ball of fire behind that point at a distance of ninety odd million\r\nmiles. The error in such a line would be very trifling.\r\n\r\nSuch observations as last mentioned would have been probably extended\r\nfrom Cephren for long lines, as being the higher pyramid above the\r\nearth's surface, and may have been made from the moon or stars.\r\n\r\nIn those days was the sun the intimate friend of man. The moon and stars\r\nwere his hand-maidens.\r\n\r\nHow many of us can point to the spot of the sun's rising or setting? We,\r\nwith our clocks, and our watches, and our compasses, rarely observe the\r\nsun or stars. But in a land and an age when the sun was the only clock,\r\nand the pyramid the only compass, the movements and positions of the\r\nheavenly bodies were known to all. These people were _familiar_ with the\r\nstars, and kept a watch upon their movements.\r\n\r\nHow many of our vaunted educated population could point out the Dog-star\r\nin the heavens?--but the whole Egyptian nation hailed his rising as the\r\nbeginning of their year, and as the harbinger of their annual blessing,\r\nthe rising of the waters of the Nile.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 38. From the North West Bearing 315° Sun in the West.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 39. From the South East Bearing 135° Sun in the West.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 40. From the North East Bearing 45° Sun in the East.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 41. From the South West Bearing 225° Sun in the East.\r\n\r\nIt is possible therefore that the land surveyors of Egypt made full use\r\nof the heavenly bodies in their surveys of the land; and while we are\r\npitifully laying out our new countries by the circumferenter and the\r\ncompass, we presume to speak slightingly of the supposed dark heathen\r\ndays, when the land of Egypt was surveyed by means of the sun and the\r\nstars, and the theodolites were built of stone, with vertical limbs five\r\nhundred feet in height, and horizontal limbs three thousand feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nImagine half a dozen such instruments as this in a distance of about\r\nsixty miles (for each group of pyramids was effectually such an\r\ninstrument), and we can form some conception of the perfection of the\r\nsurveys of an almost prehistoric nation.\r\n\r\nThe centre of Lake Moeris, in which Herodotus tells us two pyramids\r\nstood 300 feet above the level of the lake, appears from the maps to be\r\nabout S. 28° W., or S. 29° W. from Gïzeh, distant about 57 miles, and\r\nthe Meidân group of pyramids appears to be about 33 miles due south of\r\nGïzeh.\r\n\r\nFigures 38, 39, 40 and 41, show that north-west, south-east, north-east,\r\nand south-west lines from the pyramids could be extended by simply\r\nplumbing the angles. These lines would be run in sets of two's and\r\nthree's, according to the number of pyramids in the group; and their\r\nknown distances apart at that angle would check the correctness of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA splendid line was the line bearing 43° 36′ 10·15″, or 223° 36′\r\n10·15″ from Cheops and Cephren, the pyramids covering each other, the\r\nline of hypotenuse of the great 20, 21, 29 triangle of the plan. This I\r\ncall the 20, 21 line. _(See Figure_ 42.)\r\n\r\nFigure 43 represents the 3, 4, 5 triangle line from the summits of\r\nMycerinus and Cheops in true line bearing 216° 52' 11·65\". This I call\r\nthe south 4, west 3 line.\r\n\r\nThe next line is what I call the 2, 1 line, and is illustrated by figure\r\n44. It is one of the most perfect of the series, and bears S. 26° 33'\r\n54·9\" W. from the apex of Cephren. This line demonstrates clearly why\r\nMycerinus was cased with red granite.\r\n\r\nNot in memory of the beautiful and rosy-cheeked Nitocris, as some of the\r\ntomb theory people say, but for a less romantic but more useful object;\r\nsimply because, from this quarter, and round about, the lines of the\r\npyramids would have been confused if Mycerinus had not been of a\r\ndifferent color. The 2, 1 line is a line in which Mycerinus would have\r\nbeen absolutely lost in the slopes of Cephren but for his red color.\r\nThere is not a fact that more clearly establishes my theory, and the\r\nwisdom and forethought of those who planned the Gïzeh pyramids, than\r\nthis red pyramid Mycerinus, and the 2, 1 line.\r\n\r\nHekeyan Bey, speaks of this pyramid as of a \"_ruddy complexion_;\" John\r\nGreaves quotes from the Arabic book, Morat Alzeman, \"_and the lesser\r\nwhich is coloured_;\" and an Arabic writer who dates the Pyramids three\r\nhundred years before the Flood, and cannot find among the learned men of\r\nEgypt \"_any certain relation concerning them_\" nor any \"_memory of them\r\namongst men_,\" also expatiates upon the beauties of the \"_coloured\r\nsatin_\" covering of this one particular pyramid.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 42.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ANCIENT PORTABLE SURVEY INSTRUMENT.\r\n\r\nI must now commence with a single pyramid, show how approximate\r\nobservations could be made from it, and then extend the theory to a\r\ngroup with the observations thereby rendered more perfect and delicate.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose the surveyor to be standing looking at the pyramid\r\nCephren; he knows that its base is 420 cubits, and its apothem 346½\r\ncubits. He has provided himself with a model in wood, or stone, or\r\nmetal, and one thousandth of its size--therefore his model will be O.42\r\ncubit base, and O.3465 cubit apothem--or, in round numbers, eight and\r\nhalf inches base, and seven inches apothem.\r\n\r\nThis model is fixed on the centre of a card or disc, graduated from the\r\ncentre to the circumference, like a compass card, to the various points\r\nof the compass, or divisions of a circle.\r\n\r\nThe model pyramid is fastened due north and south on the lines of this\r\ncard or disc, so that when the north point of the card points north, the\r\nnorth face of the model pyramid faces to the north.\r\n\r\nThe surveyor also has a table, which, with a pair of plumb lines or\r\nmason's levels, he can erect quite level: this table is also graduated\r\nfrom the centre with divisions of a circle, or points of the compass,\r\nand it is larger than the card or disc attached to the model.\r\n\r\nThis table is made so that it can revolve upon its stand, and can be\r\nclamped. We will call it the _lower limb_. There is a pin in the centre\r\nof the lower limb, and a hole in the centre of the disc bearing the\r\nmodel, which can be thus placed upon the centre of the table, and\r\nbecomes the _upper limb_. The upper limb can be clamped to the lower\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\nThe first process will be to clamp both upper and lower limbs together,\r\nwith the north and south lines of both in unison, then revolve both\r\nlimbs on the stand till the north and south line points straight for\r\nthe pyramid in the distance, which is done by the aid of sights erected\r\nat the north and south points of the perimeter of the lower limb. When\r\nthis is adjusted, clamp the lower limb and release the upper limb; now\r\nrevolve the upper limb until the model pyramid exactly covers the\r\npyramid in the distance, and shows just the same shade on one side and\r\nlight on the other, when viewed from the sights of the clamped lower\r\nlimb--and the lines, angles, and shades of the model coincide with the\r\nlines, angles, and shades of the pyramid observed;--now clamp the upper\r\nlimb. Now does the model stand really due north and south, the same as\r\nthe pyramid in the distance; it throws the same shades, and exhibits the\r\nsame angles when seen from the same point of view; just as much of it is\r\nin shade and as much of it is in light as the pyramid under observation;\r\ntherefore it must be standing due north and south, because Cephren\r\nhimself is standing due north and south, and the upper limb reads off on\r\nthe lower limb the angle or bearing observed.\r\n\r\nSo far we possess an instrument equal to the modern circumferenter, and\r\nyet we have only brought one pyramid into work.\r\n\r\nIf I have shown that such an operation as the above is practically\r\nfeasible, if I have shown that angles can be taken with moderate\r\naccuracy by observing one pyramid of 420 cubits base, how much more\r\naccurate will the observation be when the surveyor's plane table bears\r\na group of pyramids which occupy a representative space of about 1400\r\ncubits when viewed from the south or north, and about 1760 cubits when\r\nviewed from the east or west. If situated a mile or two south of the\r\nGïzeh group our surveyor could also tie in and perfect his work by\r\nsights to the Sâkkarah group with Sâkkarah models; and so on, up the\r\nNile Valley, he would find every few miles groups of pyramids by aid of\r\nwhich he would be enabled to tie his work together.\r\n\r\nIf the Gïzeh group of pyramids is placed and shaped in the manner I have\r\ndescribed, it must be clear that an exact model and plan, say a\r\nthousandth of the size, could be very easily made--the plan being at the\r\nlevel of the base of Cephren where the bases of the two main pyramids\r\nare even;--and if they are not exactly so placed and shaped, it may be\r\nadmitted that their position and dimensions were known to the surveyors\r\nor priests, so that such models could be constructed. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that the instrument used in conjunction with these pyramids,\r\nwas a machine constructed in a similar manner to the simple machine I\r\nhave described, only instead of there being but one model pyramid on the\r\ndisc or upper limb, it bore the whole group; and the smaller pyramids\r\nwere what we may call vernier points in this great circle, enabling the\r\nsurveyor to mark off known angles with great accuracy by noticing how,\r\nas he worked round the group of pyramids, one or other of the smaller\r\nones was covered by its neighbours.[9]\r\n\r\n    Footnote 9: See general plan of Gïzeh Group op. page 1.\r\n\r\nThe immensity of the main pyramids would require the smaller ones to be\r\nused for surveys in the immediate neighbourhood, as the surveyor might\r\neasily be too close to get accurate observations from the main pyramids.\r\n\r\nThe upper limb, then, was a disc or circular plate bearing the model of\r\nthe group.\r\n\r\nCheops would be situated in the centre of the circle, and observations\r\nwould be taken by bringing the whole model group into even line and even\r\nlight and shade with the Gïzeh group.\r\n\r\nI believe that with a reasonable-sized model occupying a circle of six\r\nor seven feet diameter, such as a couple of men could carry, very\r\naccurate bearings could have been taken, and probably were taken.\r\n\r\nThe pyramid shape is the very shape of all others to employ for such\r\npurposes. A cone would be useless, because the lights and shades would\r\nbe softened off and its angles from all points would be the same. Other\r\nsolids with perpendicular angles would be useless, because although they\r\nwould vary in width from different points of view they would not present\r\nthat ever changing angle that a pyramid does when viewed from different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nAfter familiarity with the models which I have made use of in\r\nprosecuting these investigations, I find that I can judge with great\r\naccuracy _from their appearance only_ the bearing of the group from any\r\npoint at which I stand. I make bold to say that the pocket compass of\r\nthe Egyptian surveyor was a little model of the group of pyramids in his\r\ndistrict, and he had only to hold it up on his hand and turn it round in\r\nthe sun till its shades and angles corresponded with the appearance of\r\nthe group, to tell as well as we could tell by our compasses, perhaps\r\nbetter, his bearing from the landmarks that governed his surveys.\r\n\r\nThe Great Circle of Gold described by Diodorus (_Diod. Sic. lib. X.,\r\npart 2, cap. 1_) as having been employed by the Egyptians, and on which\r\nwas marked amongst other things, the position of the rising and setting\r\nof the stars, and stated by him to have been carried off by Cambysses\r\nwhen Egypt was conquered by the Persians, is supposed by Cassini to have\r\nbeen also employed for finding the meridian by observation of the rising\r\nand setting of the sun. This instrument and others described by writers\r\non Egypt would have been in practice very similar to the instrument\r\nwhich I have described as having been probably employed for terrestrial\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThe table or disc comprising the lower limb of the instrument, might\r\nhave been supported upon a small stand with a circular hole in the\r\ncentre, so arranged that the instrument could be either set up alone and\r\nsupported by its own tripod, or rested fairly on the top of any of those\r\ncurious stone boundary marks which were made use of, not only to mark\r\nthe corners of the different holdings, but to show the level of the Nile\r\ninundations. (_See Figure 49, copied from Sharpe's Egypt,_ _vol. I.,\r\np_. 6.) The peculiar shape of the top of these stone landmarks, or\r\n\"sacred boundary stones,\" appears suitable for such purposes, and it\r\nwould have been a great convenience to the surveyor, and conducive to\r\naccuracy, that it should be so arranged that the instrument should be\r\nfixed immediately over the mark, as appears probable from the shape of\r\nthe stone.\r\n\r\n    Fig 49. Sacred boundary stone.\r\n\r\nA noticeable point in this theory is, that it is not in the least\r\nessential that the apex of a pyramid should be complete. If their\r\nsummits were left permanently flat, they would work in for survey\r\npurposes quite as well, and I think better, than if carried to a point,\r\nand they would be more useful with a flat top for defined shadows when\r\nused as sun dials.\r\n\r\nIn the Gïzeh group, the summit of Cheops appears to me to have been left\r\nincomplete the better to get the range with Cephren for lines down the\r\ndelta.\r\n\r\nIn this system of surveying, there is always a beautiful connection\r\nbetween the horizontal bearings and the apparent or observed angles\r\npresented by the slopes and edges of the pyramid. Thus, in pyramids like\r\nthose of Gïzeh, which stand north and south, and whose meridional\r\nsections contain less, and whose diagonal sections contain more than a\r\nright angle, the vertex being the point at which the angle is\r\nmeasured--this law holds:-- That the smallest interior angle at the\r\nvertex, contained between the inside edge and the outside edge, will\r\nexhibit the same angle as the bearing of the observer's eye from the\r\napex of the pyramid _when the angle at the apex contained by the outside\r\nedges appears to be a right angle_.\r\n\r\nFigures 50 to 55 inclusive illustrate this beautiful law from which it\r\nwill be seen that the Gïzeh surveyors possessed, in this manner alone,\r\neight distinctly defined bearings from each pyramid.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 50.

Then to cut out of\r\nthe card-board the squares of the bases of the pyramids at the level of\r\nCephren, viz., 420, 420 and 218 cubits respectively, for the three main\r\npyramids. One hundred cubits to the inch is a convenient scale and\r\nwithin the limits of a sheet of Bath board.\r\n\r\nBy striking out the models on card-board in the manner shown by diagrams\r\n(_see Figures_ 56, 57, and 58) they can be cut out with a\r\npenknife--cutting only _half through_ where the lines are\r\n_dotted_--bent up together, and pasted along the edges with strips of\r\nwriting paper about half an inch wide.\r\n\r\nThese models can be dropped into the squares cut out of the card-board\r\nplan, thus correcting the error caused by the thickness of the\r\ncard-board base, and if placed in the sun, or at night by the light of\r\n_one_ lamp or candle properly placed to represent the sun in the\r\neastward or westward, the clear cut lines and clear contrasting shades\r\nwill be manifest, and the lines illustrated by my figures can be\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\nWhen inspecting the model, it is well to bear in mind that the eye must\r\nbe kept very nearly level with the table, or the pyramids will appear as\r\nif viewed from a balloon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI believe that the stones were got up to the building by way of the\r\nnorth side of each pyramid. The casing on the south, east, and west, was\r\nprobably built up as the work proceeded, and the whole of these three\r\nfaces were probably thus finished and completed while there was not a\r\nsingle casing stone set on the north side. Then the work would be closed\r\nup until there remained nothing but a great gap or notch, wide at the\r\nbottom, and narrowing to the apex. The work on the north side would then\r\nbe closed from the sides and top, and the bottom casing stone about the\r\ncentre of the north side, would be the last stone set on the building.\r\nThese old builders were too expert not to have thus made use of all the\r\nshade which their own building would thus afford to a majority of the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany of the obelisks were probably marks on pyramid lines of survey.\r\n\r\nThe pyramid indeed may have been a development of the obelisk for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nTheir slanting sides might correspond with some of the nearly upright\r\nslant angles of the pyramids, in positions opposite certain lines.\r\nReference to several of my figures will show how well this would come\r\nin.\r\n\r\nHerodotus speaks of two obelisks at Heliopolis, and Bonwick tells us\r\nthat Abd al Latif saw two there which he called Pharaoh's Needles. An\r\nArab traveller, in 1190, saw a pyramid of copper on the summit of the\r\none that remained, but it is now wanting. Pharaoh's Needles appear to\r\nhave been situated about 20 miles NE. of the Gïzeh group, and their\r\nslope angles might have coincided with the apparent slope angles of\r\nCephren or Cheops on the edge nearest the obelisk.\r\n\r\nThe ancient method of describing the meridian by means of the shadow of\r\na ball placed on the summit of an obelisk points to a reasonable\r\ninterpretation for the peculiar construction of the two pillars, Jachin\r\nand Boaz, which are said to have been situated in front of the Hebrew\r\nTemple at Jerusalem, and about which so much mysterious speculation has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThey were no doubt used as sun-dials for the morning and afternoon sun\r\nby the shadow of the balls or \"chapiters\" thrown upon the pavement.\r\n\r\nWithout presuming to dispute the objects assigned by others for the\r\ngalleries and passages which have been discovered in the pyramid Cheops,\r\nI venture to opine that they were employed to carry water to the\r\nbuilders. They are connected with a well, and the well with the Nile or\r\ncanal. Whether the water was slided up the smooth galleries in boxes, or\r\nwhether the cochlea, or water screw, was worked in them, their angles\r\nbeing suitable, it is impossible to conjecture; either plan would have\r\nbeen convenient and feasible.\r\n\r\nThese singular chambers and passages may indeed possibly have had to do\r\nwith some hydraulic machinery of great power which modern science knows\r\nnothing about. The section of the pyramid, showing these galleries, in\r\nthe pyramid books, has a most hydraulic appearance.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous strength and regularity of the cavities called the King's\r\nand Queen's chambers, the regularity and the _smallness_ of most of the\r\npassages or massive stone connecting pipes, favor the idea that the\r\nchambers might have been reservoirs, their curious roofs, air chambers,\r\nand the galleries or passages, connecting pipes for working water under\r\npressure. Water raised through the passages of this one pyramid nearest\r\nto the canal, might have been carried by troughs to the other pyramids,\r\nwhich were in all probability in course of construction at the same\r\nperiod of time. A profane friend of mine thinks that the sarcophagus or\r\n\"sacred coffer\" in the King's chamber may have been used by the chief\r\narchitect and leading men of the works as a _bath_, and that the King's\r\nchamber was nothing more or less than a delightful bath room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following quotation from the writing of an Arabian author (Ibn Abd\r\nAlkokm), is extracted from Bonwick's \"Pyramid Facts and Fancies,\" page\r\n72:--\"The Coptites mention in their books that upon them (the Pyramids)\r\nis an inscription engraven; the exposition of it in Arabicke is\r\nthis:--'I, Saurid the King built the Pyramids (in such and such a time),\r\nand finished them in six years; he that comes after me, and says he is\r\nequal to me, let him destroy them in six hundred years; and yet it is\r\nknown that it is easier to pluck down than to build; _and when I had\r\nfinished them, I covered them with sattin, and let him cover them with\r\nslats._'\"\r\n\r\nThe italics are my own. The builder seems to have entertained the idea\r\nthat his work would be partially destroyed, and afterwards temporarily\r\nrepaired or rebuilt. The first part has unfortunately come true, and it\r\nis possible that the last part of the idea of King Saurid may be carried\r\nout, because it would not be so very expensive an undertaking for any\r\ncivilized nation in the interest of science to re-case the pyramids of\r\nGïzeh, so that they might be once more applied to land-surveying\r\npurposes in the ancient manner.\r\n\r\nIt would not be absolutely necessary to case the whole of the pyramid\r\nfaces, so long as sufficient casing was put on to define the angles. The\r\n\"_slats_\" used might be a light wooden framework covered with thin\r\nmetal. The metal should be painted white, except in the case of\r\nMycerinus, which should be of a reddish color.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12.

I will call triangles of this class \"primary\r\ntriangles,\" as the most suitable term, although it is applied to the\r\nmain triangles of geodetic surveys.\r\n\r\nWe have only to select a number of such triangles and a system of\r\ntrigonometry ensues, in which base, perpendicular, and hypotenuse of\r\nevery triangle is a whole measure without fractions, and in which the\r\nnomenclature for every angle is clear and simple.\r\n\r\nAn angle of 43° 36′ 10·15″ will be called a 20, 21 angle, and an\r\nangle of 36° 52′ 11·65″ will be called a 3, 4 angle, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn the existing system whole angles, such as 40, 45, or 50 degrees, are\r\nsurrounded by lines, most of which can only be described in numbers by\r\ninterminable fractions.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient system, lines are only dealt with, and every angle in the\r\ntable is surrounded by lines measuring whole units, and described by the\r\nuse of a couple of simple numbers.\r\n\r\nConnecting this with our present system of trigonometry would effect a\r\nsaving in calculation, and general use of certain peculiar angles by\r\nmeans of which all the simplicity and beauty of the work of the ancients\r\nwould be combined with the excellences of our modern instrumental\r\nappliances. Surveyors should appreciate the advantages to be derived\r\nfrom laying out traverses on the hypotenuses of \"primary\" triangles, by\r\nthe saving of calculation and facility of plotting to be obtained from\r\nthe practice.\r\n\r\nThe key to these old tables is the fact, that in \"primary\" triangles the\r\nright-angled triangle formed by the sine and versed sine, also by the\r\nco-sine and co-versed-sine, is one in which base and perpendicular are\r\nmeasured by numbers without fractions. These I will call \"satellite\"\r\ntriangles.\r\n\r\nThus, to the \"primary\" triangle 20, 21, 29, the ratios of the co-sinal\r\nand sinal satellites are respectively 7 to 3, and 2 to 5. (_See Figure\r\n35._) To the 48, 55, 73 triangle the satellites are 11, 5 and 8, 3\r\n(_Fig. 62_); to the 3, 4, 5 triangle they are 2, 1 and 3, 1 (_Fig. 30_);\r\nand to the 28, 45, 53 triangle, they are 9, 5 and 7, 2 (_Fig. 61_). The\r\nprimary triangle, 7, 24, 25, possesses as satellites the \"primary\"\r\ntriangle, 3, 4, 5, and the ordinary triangle, 4, 1; and the primary\r\ntriangle 41, 840, 841, is attended by the 20, 21, 29 triangle, as a\r\nsatellite with the ordinary triangle 41, 1, and so on.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 61. The 28-45-53 Triangle.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 62. The 48-55-73 Triangle.\r\n\r\nSince any ratio, however, whose terms, one or both, are represented by\r\nfractions, can be transformed into whole numbers, it evidently follows\r\nthat every conceivable relative measure of two lines which we may\r\ndecide to call co-sine and co-versed-sine, becomes a satellite to a\r\ncorresponding \"primary\" triangle.\r\n\r\nNow, since the angle of the satellite on the circumference must be\r\n_half_ the angle of the adjacent primary triangle at the centre, it\r\nfollows that in constructing a list of satellites and their angles, the\r\nangles of the corresponding primary triangles can be found. For\r\ninstance--\r\n\r\n    Satellite 8, 3, contains 20° 33′ 21·76″\r\n    Satellite 2, 7, contains 15° 56′ 43·425″\r\n\r\nEach of these angles doubled, gives the angle of a \"primary\" triangle as\r\nfollows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    The 48, 55, 73 triangle = 41°  6′ 43·52″\r\n    The 28, 45, 53 triangle = 31° 53′ 26·85″\r\n\r\nThe angles of the satellites together must always be 45°, because the\r\nangle at the circumference of a quadrant must always be 135°.\r\n\r\nFrom the Gïzeh plan, as far as I have developed it, the following order\r\nof satellites begins to appear, which may be a guide to the complete\r\nGïzeh plan ratio, and to those \"primary\" triangles in use by the pyramid\r\nsurveyors in their ordinary work.\r\n\r\n    +-------+-------+-------+------+-------+------+------+------+\r\n    | 1,  2 |  2, 3 | 3,  4 | 4, 5 | 5,  6 | 6, 7 | 7, 8 | 8, 9 |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1,  3 |  2, 5 | 3,  5 | 4, 7 | 5,  7 |      | 7, 9 |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1,  4 |  2, 7 | 3,  7 | 4, 9 | 5,  8 |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1,  5 |  2, 9 | 3,  8 |      | 5,  9 |      | 7, 1 |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1,  6 |       |       |      | 5, 11 |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1,  7 |       | 3, 11 |      | 5, 13 |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1,  8 |       | 3, 13 |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1,  9 |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1, 11 |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1, 13 |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1, 15 |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    |       |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    | 1, 17 |       |       |      |       |      |      |      |\r\n    +-------+-------+-------+------+-------+------+------+------+\r\n\r\nPrimary triangles may be found from the _angle of the satellite_, but it\r\nis an exceedingly round-about way.

(_See Fig_. 63.) The figures in the calculation do not\r\nbalance exactly, in consequence of the insufficient delicacy of the\r\ntables or calculations.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 63.\r\n\r\nThe connection between primaries and satellites is shown by figure 64.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 64.\r\n\r\nLet the triangle ADB be a satellite, 5, 2, which we will call BD 20, and\r\nAD 8.

This is because sine and co-sine are the two denominators in\r\nthe fractional parts of the other lines when worked out at the lowest\r\nratio of sine, co-sine, and radius.\r\n\r\nAfter I found that the plan of the Gïzeh group was a system of \"primary\"\r\ntriangles, I had to work out the rule for constructing them, for I had\r\nnever met with it in any book, but I came across it afterwards in the\r\n\"Penny Encyclopedia,\" and in Rankine's \"Civil Engineering.\"\r\n\r\nThe practical utility of these triangles, however, does not appear to\r\nhave received sufficient consideration. I certainly never met with any\r\nexcept the 3, 4, 5, in the practice of any surveyor of my acquaintance.\r\n\r\n(For squaring off a line nothing could be more convenient than the 20,\r\n21, 29 triangle; for instance, taking a base of 40 links, then using the\r\nwhole chain for the two remaining sides of 42 and 58 links.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of Some Primary Triangles and their Satellites.\r\n\r\n    ANGLE OF PRIMARY       PRIMARY         SATELLITE.

By continuing the system of evolution by\r\nwhich I defined the position of Cephren, and the little pyramid to the\r\nsouth-east of Cheops, after I had obtained Cheops and Mycerinus, may be\r\nrebuilt, at one and the same time, a skeleton of the trigonometrical\r\ntables of a forgotten civilization, and the plan of those pyramids which\r\nare its only link with the present age.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE PYRAMIDS INDICATED BY THE PLAN.\r\n\r\nI pursued my investigations into the slopes and altitudes of the\r\npyramids without reference to the plan, after once deciding their exact\r\nbases.\r\n\r\nNow it will be interesting to note some of the ways in which the plan\r\nhints at the shape and size of these pyramids, and corroborates my work.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of _Cheops_ are indicated on the plan by the lines EA to\r\nYA, measuring 840 and 288 R.B. cubits respectively, being the half\r\nperiphery of its horizontal section at the level of Cephren's base, and\r\nits own altitude from its own base. (_See Fig_. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe line EA, in fact, represents in R.B. cubits the half periphery of\r\nthe bases of either Cheops or Cephren measured at the level which I\r\nhave set forth as the _plan level_, viz., base of Cephren.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of Cephren's base to Cephren's altitude is indicated on the\r\nplan by the ratios of the lines BC to EB, or FO to OR, viz., 32 to 21.\r\n(_See Fig._ 4.)\r\n\r\nThe altitude of Mycerinus above Cephren's base appears on plan in the\r\nline EF, measuring 136 R.B. cubits.\r\n\r\nThe line EO on plan measures 888 cubits, which would be the length of a\r\nline stretched from the apex of Cheops to the point E, at the level of\r\nCheops' base.\r\n\r\nThis merits consideration:--the lines EA and AY are connected on plan at\r\nthe centre of Cheops, and the lines EO and EA are connected on plan at\r\nthe point E.\r\n\r\nNow the lines EO, EA and AY are sides of a \"primary triangle,\" whose\r\nratio is 37, 35, 12, and whose measure in cubits is 888, 840, and 288;\r\nand if we suppose the line EA to be stretched horizontally beneath the\r\npyramids at the level of the base of Cheops from E to A on plan, and the\r\nline AY to be a plumb line hanging from the apex of Cheops to the level\r\nof his base, then will the line EO just stretch from the point E to the\r\napex of Cheops, and the three lines will connect the two main pyramids\r\nby a vertical triangle of which EA, AY and EO form the base,\r\nperpendicular, and hypotenuse. Or, to explain it in another manner: let\r\nthe line EA be a _cord_ stretching horizontally from A at the centre of\r\nthe base of Cheops to the point E, both ends being at the same level;\r\nlet the line AY be a _rod_, lift it on the end A till it stands erect,\r\nthen is the end Y the apex of Cheops. Now, the line EO would just\r\nstretch from the top of the rod AY to the point E first described.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular coincidence, and one that may be interesting to\r\nstudents of the _interior_ of the Pyramids, that the side EP, of the\r\nsmall 3, 4, 5 triangle, EP, PF, FE, in the centre of the plan, measures\r\n81·60 R.B. cubits, which is very nearly eight times the \"_true breadth_\"\r\nof the King's chamber in Cheops, according to Piazzi Smyth; for 81·60/8\r\n= 10·20 R.B. cubits, or 206·046 pyramid inches (one R.B. cubit being\r\n20·2006 pyramid inches). The sides of this little triangle measure\r\n81·60, 108·80, and 136, R.B. cubits respectively, as can be easily\r\nproved from the plan ratio table.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. A SIMPLE INSTRUMENT FOR LAYING OFF \"PRIMARY TRIANGLES.\"\r\n\r\nA simple instrument for laying off \"primary triangles\" upon the ground,\r\nmight have been made with three rods divided into a number of small\r\nequal divisions, with holes through each division, which rods could be\r\npinned together triangularly, the rods working as arms on a flat table,\r\nand the pins acting as pointers or sights.\r\n\r\nOne of the pins would be permanently fixed in the table through the\r\nfirst hole of two of the rods or arms, and the two other pins would be\r\nmovable so as to fix the arms into the shape of the various \"primary\r\ntriangles.\"\r\n\r\nThus with the two main arms pinned to the cross arm in the 21st and 29th\r\nhole from the permanently pinned end, with the cross arm stretched to\r\ntwenty divisions, a 20, 21, 29 triangle would be the result, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14_a_. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nI must be excused by geometricians for going so much in detail into the\r\nsimple truths connected with right-angled trigonometry. My object has\r\nbeen to make it very clear to that portion of the public not versed in\r\ngeometry, that the Pyramids of Egypt must have been used for land\r\nsurveying by right-angled triangles with sides having whole numbers.\r\n\r\nA re-examination of these pyramids on the ground with the ideas\r\nsuggested by the preceding pages in view, may lead to interesting\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it is just possible that the very accurately and\r\nbeautifully worked stones in the walls of the King's chamber of Cheops,\r\nmay be found to indicate the ratios of the rectangles formed by the\r\nbases and perpendiculars of the triangulations used by the old\r\nsurveyors--that on these walls may be found, in fact, corroboration of\r\nthe theory that I have set forth. I am led to believe also from the fact\r\nthat Gïzeh was a central and commanding locality, and that it was the\r\ncustom of those who preceded those Egyptians that history tells of, to\r\nexcavate mighty caverns in the earth--that, therefore, in the limestone\r\nupon which the pyramids are built, and underneath the pyramids, may be\r\nfound vast excavations, chambers and galleries, that had entrance on the\r\nface of the ridge at the level of High Nile. From this subterraneous\r\ncity, occupied by the priests and the surveyors of Memphis, access may\r\nbe found to every pyramid; and while to the outside world the pyramids\r\nmight have appeared sealed up as mausoleums to the Kings that it may\r\nhave seen publicly interred therein, this very sealing and closing of\r\nthe outer galleries may have only rendered their mysterious recesses\r\nmore private to the priests who entered from below, and who were,\r\nperhaps, enabled to ascend by private passages to their very summits.\r\nThe recent discovery of a number of regal mummies stowed away in an out\r\nof the way cave on the banks of the Nile, points to the unceremonious\r\nmanner in which the real rulers of Kings and people may have dealt with\r\ntheir sovereigns, the pomp and circumstance of a public burial once\r\nover. It is just possible that the chambers in the pyramids may have\r\nbeen used in connection with their mysteries: and the small passages\r\ncalled by some \"ventilators\" or \"air passages,\" sealed as they were from\r\nthe chamber by a thin stone (and therefore no ventilators) may have been\r\n_auditory passages_ along which sound might have been projected from\r\nother chambers not yet opened by the moderns; sounds which were perhaps\r\na part of the \"hanky panky\" of the ancient ceremonial connected with\r\nthe \"mysteries\" or the \"religion\" of that period.\r\n\r\nDown that \"well\" which exists in the interior of Cheops, and in the\r\nlimestone foundations of the pyramid, should I be disposed to look for\r\nopenings into the vast subterraneous chambers which I am convinced _do_\r\nexist below the Pyramids of Gïzeh.\r\n\r\nThe priests of the Pyramids of Lake Moeris had their vast subterranean\r\nresidences. It appears to me more than probable that those of Gïzeh were\r\nsimilarly provided. And I go further:--Out of these very caverns may\r\nhave been excavated the limestone of which the pyramids were built, thus\r\nkilling two birds with one stone--building the instruments and finding\r\ncool quarters below for those who were to make use of them. In the\r\nbowels of that limestone ridge on which the pyramids are built will yet\r\nbe found, I feel convinced, ample information as to their uses. A good\r\ndiamond drill with two or three hundred feet of rods is what is what is\r\nwanted to test this, and the solidity of the pyramids at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. PRIMARY TRIANGULATION.\r\n\r\nPrimary triangulation would be useful to men of almost every trade and\r\nprofession in which tools or instruments are used. Any one might in a\r\nshort time construct a table for himself answering to every degree or so\r\nin the circumference of a circle for which only forty or fifty triangles\r\nare required.\r\n\r\nIt would be worth while for some one to print and publish a correct set\r\nof these tables embracing a close division of the circle, in which set\r\nthere should be a column showing the angle in degrees, minutes, seconds\r\nand decimals, and also a column for the satellite, thus--\r\n\r\n    SATELLITE.  PRIMARY.     ANGLE.\r\n\r\n     5  2      20  21  29   43° 36′ 10·15″\r\n\r\n     7  3      21  20  29   46° 23′ 49·85″\r\n\r\nand so on. Such a set of tables would be a boon to sailors, architects,\r\nsurveyors, engineers, and all handi-craftsmen: and I make bold to say,\r\nwould assist in the intricate investigations of the astronomer:--and the\r\nrule for building the tables is so simple, that they could easily be\r\nachieved. The architect from these tables might arrange the shape of his\r\nchambers, passages or galleries, so that all measures, not only at right\r\nangles on the walls, but from any corner of floor to ceiling should be\r\neven feet. The pitch of his roofs might be more varied, and the monotony\r\nof the buildings relieved, with rafters and tie-beams always in even\r\nmeasures. The one solitary 3, 4, 5 of Vitruvius would cease to be his\r\nstandard for a staircase; and even in doors and sashes, and panels of\r\nglass, would he be alive to the perfection of rectitude gained by\r\nevenly-measured diagonals. By a slight modification of the compass card,\r\nthe navigator of blue water might steer his courses on the hypotenuses\r\nof great primary triangles--such tables would be useful to all sailors\r\nand surveyors who have to deal with latitude and departure. For\r\ninstance, familiarity with such tables would make ever present in the\r\nmind of the surveyor or sailor his proportionate northing and easting,\r\nno matter what course he was steering between north and east, \"the\r\n_primary_\" embraces the _three ideas in one view_.\r\n\r\nIn designing trussed roofs or bridges, the \"primaries\" would be\r\ninvaluable to the engineer, strain-calculations on diagonal and upright\r\nmembers would be simplified, and the builder would find the benefit of a\r\nmeasure in even feet or inches from centre of one pin or connection to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nFor earthwork slopes 3, 4, 5; 20, 21, 29; 21, 20, 29; and 4, 3, 5 would\r\nbe found more convenient ratios than 1 _to_ 1, and 1½ _to_ 1, etc.\r\nTemplates and battering rules would be more perfect and correct, and the\r\nengineer could prove his slopes and measure his work at one and the same\r\ntime without the aid of a staff or level; the slope measures would\r\nreveal the depth, and the slope measures and bottom width would be all\r\nthe measures required, while the top width would prove the correctness\r\nof the slopes and the measurements.\r\n\r\nTo the land surveyor, however, the primary triangle would be the most\r\nuseful, and more especially to those laying out new holdings, whether\r\nsmall or large, in new countries.\r\n\r\nWhether it be for a \"squatter's run,\" or for a town allotment, the\r\nadvantages of a diagonal measure to every parallelogram in even _miles_,\r\n_chains_, or _feet_, should be keenly felt and appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis was, I believe, _one_ of the secrets of the speedy and correct\r\nreplacement of boundary marks by the Egyptian land surveyors.\r\n\r\nI have heard of a review in the \"Contemporary,\" September, 1881,\r\nreferring to the translation of a papyrus in the British Museum, by Dr.\r\nEisenlohr--\"_A handbook of practical arithmetic and geometry,\" etc.,\r\n\"such as we might suppose would be used by a scribe acting as clerk of\r\nthe works, or by an architect to shew the working out of the problems he\r\nhad to solve in his operations_.\" I should like to see a translation of\r\nthe book, from which it appears that \"_the clumsiness of the Egyptian\r\nmethod is very remarkable_.\" Perhaps this Egyptian \"_Handbook_\" may yet\r\nshew that their operations were not so \"_clumsy_,\" as they appear at\r\nfirst sight to those accustomed to the practice of modern trigonometry.\r\nI may not have got the exact \"hang\" of the Egyptian method of land\r\nsurveying--for I do not suppose that even their \"clumsy\" method is to be\r\ngot at intuitively; but I claim that I have shewn how the Pyramids could\r\nbe used for that purpose, and that the subsidiary instrument described\r\nby me was practicable.\r\n\r\nI claim, therefore, that the theory I have set up, that the pyramids\r\nwere the theodolites of the Egyptians, is sound. That the ground plan of\r\nthese pyramids discloses a beautiful system of primary triangles and\r\nsatellites I think I have shown beyond the shadow of a doubt; and that\r\nthis system of geometric triangulation or right-angled trigonometry was\r\nthe method practised, seems in the preceding pages to be fairly\r\nestablished. I claim, therefore, that I have discovered and described\r\nthe main secret of the pyramids, that I have found for them at last a\r\npractical use, and that it is no longer \"_a marvel how after the annual\r\ninundation, each property could have been accurately described by the\r\naid of geometry._\" I have advanced nothing in the shape of a theory that\r\nwill not stand a practical test; but to do it, the pyramids should be\r\n_re-cased_. Iron sheeting, on iron or wooden framework, would answer. I\r\nmay be wrong in some of my conclusions, but in the main I am satisfied\r\nthat I am right. It must be admitted that I have worked under\r\ndifficulties; a glimpse at the pyramids three and twenty years ago, and\r\nthe meagre library of a nomad in the Australian wilderness having been\r\nall my advantages, and time at my disposal only that snatched from the\r\nrare intervals of leisure afforded by a arduous professional life.\r\n\r\nAfter fruitless waiting for a chance of visiting Egypt and Europe, to\r\nsift the matter to the bottom, I have at last resolved to give my ideas\r\nto the world as they stand; crude necessarily, so I must be excused if\r\nin some details I may be found erroneous; there is truth I know in the\r\ngeneral conclusions. I am presumptuous enough to believe that the R.B.\r\ncubit of 1·685 British feet was the measure of the pyramids of Gïzeh,\r\nalthough there may have been an astronomical 25 inch cubit also. It\r\nappears to me that no cubit measure to be depended on is either to be\r\ngot from a stray measuring stick found in the joints of a ruined\r\nbuilding, or from any line or dimensions of one of the pyramids. I\r\nsubmit that a most reasonable way to get a cubit measure out of the\r\nPyramids of Gïzeh, was to do as I did:--take them as a whole, comprehend\r\nand establish the general ground plan, find it geometric and harmonic,\r\nobtain the ratios of all the lines, establish a complete set of natural\r\nand even numbers to represent the measures of the lines, and finally\r\nbring these numbers to cubits by a common multiplier (which in this case\r\nwas the number eight). After the whole proportions had been thus\r\nexpressed in a cubit evolved _from_ the whole proportions, I established\r\nits length in British feet by dividing the base of Cephren, as known, by\r\nthe number of my cubits representing its base. It is pretty sound\r\nevidence of the theory being correct that this test, with 420 cubits\r\nneat for Cephren, gave me also a neat measure for Cheops, from Piazzi\r\nSmyth's base, of 452 cubits, and that at the same level, these two\r\npyramids become equal based.\r\n\r\nI have paid little attention to the inside measurements. I take it we\r\nshould first obtain our exoteric knowledge before venturing on esotoric\r\nresearch. Thus the intricate internal measurements of Cheops, made by\r\nvarious enquirers have been little service to me, while the accurate\r\nmeasures of the base of Cheops by Piazzi Smyth, and John James Wild's\r\nletter to Lord Brougham, helped me amazingly, as from the two I\r\nestablished the plan level and even bases of Cheops and Cephren at plan\r\nlevel--as I have shown in the preceding pages. My theory demanded that\r\nboth for the building of the pyramids and for the construction of the\r\nmodels or subsidiary instruments of the surveyors, simple slope ratios\r\nshould govern each building; before I conclude, I shall show how I got\r\nat my slope ratios, by evolving them from the general ground plan.\r\n\r\nI am firmly convinced that a careful investigation into the ground plans\r\nof the various other groups of pyramids will amply confirm my survey\r\ntheory--the relative positions of the groups should also be\r\nestablished--much additional light will be then thrown on the subject.\r\n\r\nLet me conjure the investigator to view these piles _from a distance_\r\nwith his mind's eye, as the old surveyors viewed them with their bodily\r\neye. Approach them too nearly, and, like Henry Kinglake, you will be\r\nlost in the \"_one idea of solid immensity._\" Common sense tells us they\r\nwere built to be viewed from a distance.\r\n\r\nModern surveyors stand _near_ their instruments, and send their flagmen\r\nto a distance; the Egyptian surveyor was _one of his own flagmen_, and\r\nhis instruments were towering to the skies on the distant horizon. These\r\nmighty tools will last out many a generation of surveyors.\r\n\r\nThe modern astronomer from the top of an observatory points his\r\ninstruments direct at the stars; the Egyptian astronomer from the summit\r\nof his particular pyramid directed his observations to the rising and\r\nsetting of the stars, or the positions of the heavenly bodies in\r\nrespect to the far away groups of pyramids scattered around him in the\r\ndistance; and by comparing notes, and with the knowledge of the relative\r\nposition of the groups, did these observers map out the sky. Solar and\r\nlunar shadows of their own pyramids on the flat trenches prepared for\r\nthe purpose, enabled the astronomer at each observatory to record the\r\nannual and monthly flight of time, while its hours were marked by the\r\nshadows of their obelisks, capped by copper pyramids or balls, on the\r\nmore delicate pavements of the court-yards of their public buildings.\r\n\r\nWe must grasp that their celestial and terrestrial surveys were almost a\r\nreverse process to our own, before we can venture to enquire into its\r\ndetails. It then becomes a much easier tangle to unravel. That a\r\nparticular pyramid among so many, should have been chosen as a favoured\r\ninterpreter of Divine truths, seems an unfair conclusion to the other\r\npyramids;--that the other pyramids were rough and imperfect imitations,\r\nappears to my poor capacity \"a base and impotent conclusion;\"--(as far\r\nas I can learn, _Mycerinus_, in its perfection, was a marvel of the\r\nmason's art;) but that one particular pyramid should have anything to do\r\nwith the past or the future of the lost ten tribes of Israel (whoever\r\nthat fraction of our present earthly community may be), seems to me the\r\nwildest conclusion of all, except perhaps the theory that this one\r\npyramid points to the future of the British race. Yet in one way do I\r\nadmit that the pyramids point to our future.\r\n\r\nThirty-six centuries ago, they, already venerable with antiquity, looked\r\nproudly down on living labouring Israel, in helpless slavery, in the\r\nmidst of an advanced civilization, of which the history, language, and\r\nreligion are now forgotten, or only at best, slightly understood.\r\n\r\nThirty-six centuries hence, they may look down on a civilization equally\r\nstrange, in which our history, language, and religion, Hebrew race, and\r\nBritish race, may have no place, no part.\r\n\r\nIf the thoughts of noble poets live, as they seem to do, old Cheops,\r\nthat mountain of massive masonry, may (like the brook of our Laureate),\r\nin that dim future, still be singing, as he seems to sing now, this\r\nidea, though not perhaps these words:\r\n\r\n    \"For men may come, and men may go,\r\n    But I go on for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ars longa, vita brevis.\" Man's work remains, when the workman is\r\nforgotten; fair work and square, can never perish entirely from men's\r\nminds, so long as the world stands. These pyramids were grand and noble\r\nworks, and they will not perish till their reputation has been\r\nre-established in the world, when they will live in men's memories to\r\nall generations as symbols of the mighty past. To the minds of many now,\r\nas to Josephus in his day, they are \"_vast and vain monuments,_\" records\r\nof folly. To me they are as monuments of peace, civilization and\r\norder--relics of a people living under wise and beneficent\r\nrulers--evidences of cultivation, science, and art.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. THE PENTANGLE OR FIVE POINTED STAR THE GEOMETRIC SYMBOL OF THE\r\nGREAT PYRAMID.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial this symbol has been a blazing pointer to grand and\r\nnoble truths, and a solemn emblem of important duties.\r\n\r\nIts geometric significance, however, has long been lost sight of.\r\n\r\nIt is said to have constituted the seal or signet of King Solomon (1000\r\nB.C.), and in early times it was in use among the Jews, as a symbol of\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nIt was the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, and the Pythagorean emblem of health\r\n(530 B.C.).\r\n\r\nIt was carried as the banner of Antiochus, King of Syria (surnamed\r\nSoter, or the Preserver), in his wars against the Gauls (260 B.C.).\r\nAmong the Cabalists, the star with the sacred name written on each of\r\nits points, and in the centre, was considered talismanic; and in ancient\r\ntimes it was employed all over Asia as a charm against witchcraft. Even\r\nnow, European troops at war with Arab tribes, sometimes find, under the\r\nclothing, on the breasts of their slain enemies, this ancient emblem, in\r\nthe form of a metal talisman, or charm.\r\n\r\nThe European Göethe puts these words into the mouth of Mephistopheles:\r\n\r\n     \"I am hindered egress by a quaint device upon the threshold,--that\r\n     five-toed damned spell.\"\r\n\r\nI shall set forth the geometric significance of this star, as far as my\r\ngeneral subject warrants me, and show that it is the _geometric emblem\r\nof extreme and mean ratio_, and the _symbol of the Egyptian Pyramid\r\nCheops_.\r\n\r\nA plane geometric star, or a solid geometric pyramid, may be likened to\r\nthe corolla of a flower, each separate side representing a petal. With\r\nits petals opened and exposed to view, the flower appears in all its\r\nglorious beauty; but when closed, many of its beauties are hidden. The\r\nbotanist seeks to view it flat or open in its geometric symmetry, and\r\nalso closed, as a bud, or in repose:--yet judges and appreciates the one\r\nstate from the other. In the same manner must we deal with the five\r\npointed star, and also with the Pyramid Cheops.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with so quaint a subject, I may be excused, in passing, for\r\nthe quaint conceit of likening the interior galleries and chambers of\r\nthis pyramid to the interior whorl of a flower, stamens and pistil,\r\nmysterious and incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nFigure 67 (page 101), is the five pointed star, formed by the unlapping\r\nof the five slant sides of a pyramid with a pentagonal base.\r\n\r\nFigure 70 (page 106), is a star formed by the unlapping of the four\r\nslant sides of the pyramid Cheops.\r\n\r\nThe pentagon GFRHQ, (_Fig._ 67) is the base of the pyramid \"_Pentalpha_\"\r\nand the triangles EGF, BFR, ROH, HNQ and QAG, represent the five sides,\r\nso that supposing the lines GF, FR, RH, HQ and QG, to be hinges\r\nconnecting these sides with the base, then by lifting the sides, and\r\nclosing them in, the points A, E, B, O, and N, would meet over the\r\ncentre C.\r\n\r\nThus do we close the geometric flower Pentalpha, and convert it into a\r\npyramid.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner must we lift the four slant sides of the pyramid\r\nCheops from its star development, (_Fig._ 70) and close them in, the\r\nfour points meeting over the centre of the base, forming the solid\r\npyramid. Such transitions point to the indissoluble connection between\r\nplane and solid geometry.\r\n\r\nAs the _geometric emblem of extreme and mean ratio_, the pentangle\r\nappears as an assemblage of lines divided the one by the others _in\r\nextreme and mean ratio_.\r\n\r\nTo explain to readers not versed in geometry, what extreme and mean\r\nratio signifies, I refer to Figure 65:--\r\n\r\n    Fig. 65.\r\n\r\n    Let AB be the given line to be divided in extreme and mean ratio,\r\n    _i.e._, so that the whole line may be to the greater part, as the\r\n    greater is to the less part.\r\n\r\nDraw BC perpendicular to AB, and equal to half AB. Join AC; and with BC\r\nas a radius from C as a centre, describe the arc DB; then with centre A,\r\nand radius AD, describe the arc DE; so shall AB be divided in E, in\r\nextreme and mean ratio, or so that AB: AE:: AE: EB. (Note that AE is\r\nequal to the side of a decagon inscribed in a circle with radius AB.)\r\n\r\nLet it be noted that since the division of a line in mean and extreme\r\nratio is effected by means of the 2, 1 triangle, ABC, therefore, as the\r\nexponent of this ratio, another reason presents itself why it should be\r\nso important a feature in the Gïzeh pyramids in addition to its\r\nconnection with the primary triangle 3, 4, 5.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 66.\r\n\r\nTo complete the explanation offered with figure 65, I must refer to Fig.\r\n66, where in constructing a pentagon, the 2, 1 triangle ABC, is again\r\nmade use of.\r\n\r\n     The line AB is a side of the pentagon. The line BC is a\r\n     perpendicular to it, and half its length. The line AC is produced\r\n     to F, CF being made equal to CB; then with B as a centre, and\r\n     radius BF, the arc at E is described; and with A as a centre, and\r\n     the same radius, the arc at E is intersected, their intersection\r\n     being the centre of the circle circumscribing the pentagon, and\r\n     upon which the remaining sides are laid off.\r\n\r\nWe will now refer to figure 67, in which the pentangle appears as the\r\nsymbolic exponent of the division of lines in extreme and mean ratio.\r\n\r\n    Thus:  MC : MH :: MH : HC\r\n           AF : AG :: AG : GF\r\n           AB : AF :: AF : FB\r\n\r\nwhile MN, MH or XC: CD:: 2: 1--being the geometric template of the work.\r\n\r\nThus every line in this beautiful symbol by its intersections with the\r\nother lines, manifests the problem.\r\n\r\nNote also that\r\n\r\n    GH = GA\r\n    AE = AF\r\n    DH = DE\r\n\r\nI append a table showing the comparative measures of the lines in Fig.\r\n67, taking radius of the circle as a million units.\r\n\r\n    Fig 67.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable Showing the Comparative Measures of Lines.\r\n\r\n(_Fig. 67._)\r\n\r\n    ME = 2000000 = diameter.\r\n\r\n    AB = 1902113 = AD ÷ DB\r\n\r\n    MB = 1618034 = MC + MH = MP + PB\r\n\r\n    AS = 1538841·5\r\n\r\n    EP = 1453086 = AG + FB\r\n\r\n    AF = 1175570 = AE = GB\r\n\r\n    MC = 1000000 = radius = CD + DX = CH + CX\r\n\r\n    AD = 951056·5 = DB = DS\r\n\r\n    PB = 854102\r\n\r\n    QS = 812298·5\r\n\r\n    MP = 763932 = CH × 2 = base of Cheops.\r\n\r\n    AG = 726543 = GH = XH = HN = PF = FB = Slant\r\n    edge of Cheops. = slant edge of Pent.

Then the\r\npoints A, E, B, O, N of the five slant slides, when closed up, will all\r\nmeet at the point X over the centre C.\r\n\r\nWe have now built a pyramid out of the pentangle, whose slope is 2 to 1,\r\naltitude CX being to CD as 2 to 1.\r\n\r\n    Apothem  DX = DE\r\n    Altitude CX = HM or MN\r\n    Altitude CX + CH = CM radius.\r\n    Apothem  DX + CD = CM radius.\r\n    Edge     HX = HN or PF\r\n\r\n\r\n    Note also that\r\n\r\n    MP\r\n    -- = CH\r\n    2\r\n\r\n    OP = HR\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the _Pentangle as the symbol of the Great Pyramid\r\nCheops_.\r\n\r\n    The line MP = the base of Cheops.\r\n    The line CH = half base of Cheops.\r\n    The line HM = apothem of Cheops.\r\n    The line HN = slant edge of Cheops.\r\n\r\n    Thus: Apothem of Cheops = side of decagon.\r\n\r\n    Apothem of Cheops = altitude of pentagonal pyramid.\r\n    Slant edge of Cheops = slant edge of pentagonal pyramid.\r\n\r\n  Now since apothem of Cheops = MH\r\n      and half base of Cheops = HC\r\n\r\nthen do apothem and half base represent, when taken together, extreme\r\nand mean ratio, and altitude is a mean proportional between them: it\r\nhaving already been stated, which also is proved by the figures in the\r\ntable, that MC : MH :: MH : HC and apoth: alt :: alt : half base.\r\n\r\nThus is the four pointed star _Cheops_ evolved from the five pointed\r\nstar _Pentalpha_. This is shown clearly by Fig. 68, thus:--\r\n\r\n    Fig. 68.\r\n\r\nWithin a circle describe a pentangle, around the interior pentagon of\r\nthe star describe a circle, around the circle describe a square; then\r\nwill the square represent the base of Cheops.\r\n\r\nDraw two diameters of the outer circle passing through the centre square\r\nat right angles to each other, and each diameter parallel to sides of\r\nthe square; then will the parts of these diameters between the square\r\nand the outer circle represent the four apothems of the four slant sides\r\nof the pyramid. Connect the angles of the square with the circumference\r\nof the outer circle by lines at the four points indicated by the\r\ndiameters, and the star of the pyramid is formed, which, when closed as\r\na solid, will be a correct model of Cheops.\r\n\r\n     Calling apothem of Cheops, MH = 34\r\n                 and half base, HC = 21\r\n    as per Figure 6. Then--     MH + MC = 55\r\n\r\nand 55 : 34 :: 34 : 21·018, being only in error a few inches in the\r\npyramid itself, if carried into actual measures.\r\n\r\nThe ratio, therefore, of apothem to half-base, 34 to 21, which I ascribe\r\nto Cheops, is as near as stone and mortar can be got to illustrate the\r\nabove proportions.\r\n\r\nCorrectly stated arithmetically let MH = 2.\r\n\r\n    Then                HC = √5 - 1\r\n                        MC = √5 + 1\r\n\r\n    and altitude of Cheops = √(MH × MC)\r\n\r\nLet us now compare the construction of the two stars:--\r\n\r\n    Fig. 69.\r\n\r\nTO CONSTRUCT THE STAR PENTALPHA FIG. 69.\r\n\r\nDescribe a circle.\r\nDraw diameter MCE.\r\nDivide MC in mean and extreme ratio at H.\r\nLay off half MH from C, to D.\r\nDraw chord ADB, at right angles to diameter ECM.\r\nDraw chord BHN, through H.\r\nDraw chord AHO, through H.\r\nConnect NE.\r\nConnect EO.\r\n\r\n    Fig. 70.\r\n\r\nTO CONSTRUCT THE STAR CHEOPS, FIG. 70.\r\n\r\nDescribe a circle.\r\nDraw diameter MCE.\r\nDivide MC in mean and extreme ratio, at H.\r\nDescribe an inner circle with radius CH, and around it describe the\r\n    square a, b, c, d.\r\nDraw diameter ACB, at right angles to diameter ECM.\r\nDraw Aa, aE, Eb, bB, Bd, dM,\r\nMc, and cA.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, does this pyramid Cheops set forth by the\r\nrelations of its altitude to perimeter of base the ratio of diameter to\r\ncircumference; or, does it set forth mean proportional, and extreme and\r\nmean ratio, by the proportions of its apothem, altitude, and half-base?\r\nThe answer is--from the practical impossibility of such extreme accuracy\r\nin such a mass of masonry, that it points alike to all, and may as\r\nfairly be considered the exponent of the one as of the others. Piazzi\r\nSmyth makes Cheops 761·65 feet base, and 484·91 feet altitude, which is\r\nvery nearly what he calls a [Pi] pyramid, for which I reckon the\r\naltitude would be about 484·87 feet with the same base: and for a\r\npyramid of extreme and mean ratio the altitude would be 484·34 feet.\r\n\r\nThe whole difference, therefore, is only about six inches in a height of\r\nnearly five hundred feet. This difference, evidently beyond the power of\r\nman to discover, now that the pyramid is a ruin, would even in its\r\nperfect state have been inappreciable.\r\n\r\nIt appears most probable that the star Pentalpha led to the star Cheops,\r\nand that the star Cheops (_Fig_. 70) was the plan used by the ancient\r\narchitect, and the ratio of 34 to 21, hypotenuse to base, the template\r\nused by the ancient builders.\r\n\r\nSuppose some king said to his architect, \"Make me a plan of a pyramid,\r\nof which the base shall be 420 cubits square, and altitude shall be to\r\nthe perimeter of the base as the radius of a circle to the\r\ncircumference.\"--Then might the architect prepare an elaborate plan in\r\nwhich the relative dimensions would be about--\r\n\r\n                                       R. B.

Base : Apothem :: Altitude : Half-Base._\r\n    as shown by the ratios, (_Fig_. 13), 40 : 32 :: 25 : 20.\r\n\r\n  _Cephren. Diagonal of Base : Edge :: Edge : Altitude._\r\n    as shown by ratios, (_Fig_. 12), 862 : 588 :: 588 : 400.\r\n\r\n  _Cheops. (Apothem + Half Base): Apoth. :: Apoth. : Half Base._\r\n    as shown by the ratios, (_Fig_. 9), 55 : 34 :: 34 : 21.\r\n\r\n  and--_Apothem : Altitude :: Altitude : Half-B._\r\n\r\nSimilar close relations to other stars may be found in other pyramids.\r\nThus:--_Suppose NHO of figure 69 to be the NHO of a heptangle instead of\r\na pentangle_, then does NH represent apothem, and NO represent base of\r\nthe pyramid Mycerinus, while the co-sine of the angle NHM (being MH\r\nminus versed sine) will be equal to the altitude of the pyramid. The\r\nangle NHM in the heptangle is, 38° 34′ 17·142″, and according to my\r\nplan of the pyramid Mycerinus, the corresponding angle is 38° 40′ 56″.\r\n(_See Fig_. 19.) This angular difference of 0° 6′ 39″ would only make\r\na difference in the apothem of the pyramid of _eight inches_, and of\r\n_ten inches_ in its altitude (apothem being 283 ft. 1 inch, and\r\naltitude 221 ft.).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SLOPE RATIOS OF THE PYRAMIDS WERE ARRIVED\r\nAT.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which I arrived at the Slope Ratios of the Pyramids, viz.,\r\n32 _to_ 20, 33 _to_ 20, and 34 _to_ 21, for _Mycerinus_, _Cephren_, and\r\n_Cheops_, respectively (_see Figures_ 8, 7 _and_ 6), was as follows:--\r\n\r\nFirst, believing in the connection between the relative positions of the\r\nPyramids on plan (_see Fig_. 3, 4 _or_ 5), and their slopes, I viewed\r\ntheir positions thus:--\r\n\r\nMycerinus, situate at the angle of the 3, 4, 5 triangle ADC, is likely\r\nto be connected with that \"primary\" in his slopes.\r\n\r\nCephren, situate at the angle of the 20, 21, 29 triangle FAB, and\r\nstrung, as it were, on the hypotenuse of the 3, 4, 5 triangle DAC, is\r\nlikely to be connected with _both_ primaries in his slopes.\r\n\r\nCheops, situate at the point A, common to both main triangles, governing\r\nthe position of the other pyramids, is likely to be a sort of mean\r\nbetween these two pyramids in his slope ratios.\r\n\r\nReasoning thus, with the addition of the knowledge I possessed of the\r\nangular estimates of these slopes made by those who had visited the\r\nground, and a useful start for my ratios gained by the reduction of base\r\nmeasures already known into R.B. cubits, giving 420 as a general base\r\nfor Cheops and Cephren at one level, and taking 210 cubits as the base\r\nof Mycerinus (half the base of Cephren, as generally admitted), I had\r\nsomething solid and substantial to go upon. I commenced with Mycerinus.\r\n(_See Fig_. 71.)\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 71. (Mycerinus)_\r\n\r\nLHNM represents the base of the pyramid. On the half-base AC I described\r\na 3, 4, 5 triangle ABC. I then projected the line CF = BC to be the\r\naltitude of the pyramid. Thus I erected the triangle BFC, ratio of BC to\r\nCF being 1 to 1. From this datum I arrived at the triangles BEA, ADC,\r\nand GKH. GK, EA, and AD, each represent apothem of pyramid; CF, and CD,\r\naltitude; and HK, edge.\r\n\r\nThe length of the line AD being √(AC² + CD²), the length of the line HK\r\nbeing √(HG² + GK²), and line CH (half diagonal of base) being\r\n√(CG² + GH²). These measures reduced to R.B. cubits, calling the line\r\nAC = ratio 4 = 105 cubits, half-base of pyramid, give the following\r\nresults:--\r\n\r\n                             R. B.

Lift the plane BCF on its hinge till the point F is\r\nvertical over the centre C. Lift plane CDA on its hinge, till point D is\r\nvertical over the centre C; then will line CD touch CF, and become one\r\nline. Now lift the plane AEB on its hinge, until point E is vertical\r\nover the centre C, and plane HKG on its hinge till point K is vertical\r\nover the centre C; then will points E, F, D and K, all meet at one point\r\nabove the centre C, and all the lines will be in their proper places.\r\n\r\nThe angle at the base of Mycerinus, if built to a ratio of 4 to 5\r\n(half-base to altitude), and not to the more practical but nearly\r\nperfect ratio of 32 to 20 (apothem to half-base) would be the complement\r\nof angle ADC, thus--\r\n\r\n     4                                165″\r\n    --- = ·8 = Tan. < ADC = 38° 39′ 35---\r\n     5                                477\r\n\r\n                                      312″\r\n                ∴  < DAC = 51° 20′ 24---\r\n                                      477\r\n\r\nbut as it is probable that the pyramid was built to the ratio of 32 to\r\n20, I have shown its base angle in Figure 19, as 51° 19′ 4″.\r\n\r\nFigure 72 shows how the slopes of _Cephren_ were arrived at.\r\n\r\n    _Fig. 72. (Cephren)_\r\n\r\nLHNM represents the base of the pyramid. On the half-base AC, I\r\ndescribed a 3, 4, 5 triangle ABC. I then projected the line CF (ratio 21\r\nto BC 20), thus erecting the 20, 21, 29 triangle BCF. From this datum, I\r\narrived at the triangles BEA, ADC, and GKH; GK, EA and AD each\r\nrepresenting apothem; CF and CD, altitude; and HK, edge. The lengths of\r\nthe lines AD, HK and CH being got at as in the pyramid Mycerinus. These\r\nmeasures reduced to cubits, calling AC = ratio 16 = 210 cubits\r\n(half-base of pyramid) give the following result.\r\n\r\n                         R. B.

(Cheops) _\r\n\r\nBut to produce the building ratio of 34 to 21, as per diagram Figure 6\r\nor 9, I had to alter it to--\r\n\r\n    Half-base   210\r\n    Altitude    267·394839\r\n    Apothem     340°\r\n\r\nThus the theoretical angle of Cheops is 51° 51′ 14·3″, and the\r\nprobable angle at which it was built, is 51° 51′ 20″, as per\r\nfigure 15.\r\n\r\nCheops is therefore the mean or centre of a system--the slopes of\r\nMycerinus being a little flatter, and those of Cephren a little steeper,\r\nCheops coming fairly between the two, within about 10 minutes; and thus\r\nthe connection between the ground plan of the group and the slopes of\r\nthe three pyramids is exactly as one might expect after examination of\r\nFigure 3, 4 or 5.",
