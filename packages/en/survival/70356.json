Many of the men to whom\r\nnatural history science owes so much, lived extremely retired and\r\nuneventful lives; but a few, and as might have been anticipated, the\r\nreformers and epoch makers of their respective sciences, have had their\r\nmost interesting biographies well written. Abstracts of these biographies\r\nform a large portion of this book; and the author desires to acknowledge\r\nthe very copious extracts he has made, from sources which he has\r\nrecognized in the proper places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us, on leaving school or college, are anxious about our future\r\ncareer in the world, and concerning how we are to live, and what will be\r\nour occupations. Some young people who have finished their education,\r\nfind themselves in comfortable circumstances, and are apt to look\r\nforward to an easy life; but the majority have a hard struggle before\r\nthem, ere they can hope to be free from cares and to be successful.\r\nYet it usually happens, that those youths starting with the very best\r\nprospects, do not live so happily, usefully, and well, as those who have\r\nto struggle with poverty, and who casting aside inglorious ease, labour\r\non perseveringly. It is hard to believe, until the experience of years\r\nbrings its very practical proofs that knowledge is more valuable than\r\nmoney; and therefore, how to get rich, is a predominant question with the\r\nmajority of us. But the history of the struggles and successes of some\r\nof the men who have led most useful and beautiful lives, generally shows\r\nthat industry, perseverance and contentment have served them better than\r\npecuniary wealth, and that this has often been a source of trouble to\r\nthem. There is no better incitement to a youth who has tried to do his\r\nbest at school, and who is thinking about leading a useful, successful\r\nlife, than to read the history of the lives of the men whose names are\r\nhousehold words in the branches of knowledge he has learned.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, much care is taken to instruct young people about\r\nthe nature and uses of plants, the characteristics of animals and the\r\nancient history of the earth. Museums are readily visited, and little\r\nhome collections of plants, insects, birds, and fossils are frequently\r\neasily made. Natural history, in all its branches, is easily studied; and\r\nas one becomes learned in it, the names of many men, constantly, come\r\nbefore the student as the masters of their respective subjects. Who has\r\nnot heard of Linnæus, Cuvier, and Lyell? If any young naturalist will\r\nread the history of the lives of these great men, he will find much that\r\nis very noble in them; he will see that they made their way through great\r\ndifficulties, by constant and great intellectual labour, and that they\r\nled very good, and useful, and happy lives.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that any one just commencing to study nature, is anxious\r\nto make a great discovery and to obtain a great name. The history of the\r\nlives of these and other heroes of science, will prove to him, however,\r\nthat discoveries are not sudden gains of knowledge, but are the result\r\nof very slow and gradual accumulation of facts. If he is a real student\r\nof nature, he will strive for truth and not for personal distinction;\r\nand the truth, brings a better reward than the fleeting praise of man.\r\nThe true lasts. He will be able to glean that the special gifts of men,\r\nif properly fostered and cultivated, advance knowledge in particular\r\ndirections, and that certain great changes and advances in the method\r\nof learning, have been due to men who have begun poor, have laboured\r\nhard, have been persecuted and vilified, and who have nevertheless lived\r\nhappily in their consciences, and have often become great men in every\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe following chapters contain the history of the lives of some of the\r\nmost interesting men of ancient and modern times—of men who are the\r\nheroes of Botany, Zoology, and Geology, and who have added methods of\r\nstudy and many facts to their sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     PAGE.\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n         THE INFANCY OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCIENCE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    Old fancies and notions about plants—Aristoteles, the first\r\n    botanist—Theophrastus—Plinius—Dioscorides—Their lives, labours,\r\n    and troubles                                                         1\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                   THE RISE OF THE SCIENCE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    John Ray—Joseph de Tournefort—Their lives                           27\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                          THE LIFE OF LINNÆUS.\r\n\r\n    The science of plants begins to mature, to be reformed, and to\r\n    be made more exact                                                  52\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                   THE LIFE OF LINNÆUS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n    The publication and reception of the artificial system of\r\n    classifying plants                                                  81\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n               THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE SCIENCE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    The life of De Candolle—The Natural System                          98\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                           HEROES OF ZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The nature of the science of zoology—Great zoologists usually\r\n    botanists also—Aristoteles as a zoologist—Plinius—The long age\r\n    of no progress—The life of Conrad Gesner—The zoology of Ray and\r\n    Willughby—Swammerdam—Réaumur—The zoology of Linnæus                122\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n               THE LIVES OF BUFFON, PENNANT, AND LAMARCK.\r\n\r\n    The popular writings of Buffon, and his life—Pennant’s\r\n    life—Lamarck and his life—The rise of popular natural history,\r\n    and of exact descriptions and philosophical zoology                144\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                           THE LIFE OF CUVIER.\r\n\r\n    The union of zoology and comparative anatomy, and the\r\n    examination and study of fossil remains                            178\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                           HEROES OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The rise of the science which treats of the ancient history\r\n    of the earth—Students of the present changes which are\r\n    the examples by which the past may be comprehended—The\r\n    Greeks—The life of Pythagoras;

These appear to have been the questions that the earliest\r\nraces of men sought to answer for themselves. They gave plants names, and\r\nascribed some truthful and a great many very curious and false properties\r\nto them. Many of the first races of men lived on fruits, vegetables,\r\nand roots, and it became important to know good and nourishing plants\r\nfrom those which were poisonous. The ablest men of the tribes, probably,\r\nstudied the names which had been given by custom to many plants; and the\r\nhealing power of some plants, and the poisonous nature of others began\r\nto be known; the good and ill-disposed amongst men endeavoured to learn\r\nall about them. Thus the first steps in the science of plants were to\r\nname them, and to ascribe properties to them. It has often been noticed\r\nthat there is some resemblance between the history of the progress of\r\na science, during all the ages of civilization, and that of the rise\r\nand progress of one in the child, youth, and man. The child receives\r\neverything that it is told, as a truth, and loves the wonderful; the\r\nyouth likes to hear of mysteries, and his emotions and poetic feeling\r\nlead him to desire general truths; and the man criticizes what he has\r\nbeen told, tries to learn for himself, and longs for exact knowledge and\r\nthe absolute truth. So in the early days of civilization, men believed\r\nin everything that was told them, and ascribed wonderful properties to\r\nthe nature around them which they saw was so beautiful and yet often so\r\nterrible. As the world got older, curious legends were associated with\r\ntruths and falsities; and with the general diffusion of learning, and the\r\ncareful exercise of the reasoning powers, knowledge became more exact and\r\nuseful, and was followed for truth’s sake.\r\n\r\nAll branches of knowledge relating to nature passed through many stages,\r\nand were influenced by the prevailing habits and methods of thought of\r\nthe age. The wonderful, the mysterious, the marvellous, the union of\r\npoetry with true and false religion, the struggle between the desire for\r\ntruth and fear of the persecution of the ignorant, and the victory of\r\ncultivated observation and reason, all followed, in order, during the\r\nhistory of the progress of every science. A great writer states that it\r\ncannot then surprise us that the earliest lore concerning plants, which\r\nwe discover in the records of the past, consists of mythological legends,\r\nmarvellous relations, and extraordinary medicinal qualities. To the\r\nlively fancy of the Greeks, the narcissus, which bends its head over the\r\nstream, was originally a youth who, in such an attitude, became enamoured\r\nof his own beauty. The hyacinth, on whose flower certain markings are to\r\nbe traced resembling the Greek expression of grief (ΑΙΑΙ), recorded the\r\nsorrow of the god Apollo for the death of his favourite Hyacinthus. The\r\nbeautiful lotus of India, which floats with its splendid flower on the\r\nsurface of the water, is the chosen seat of the goddess Lackshmi, the\r\ndaughter of Ocean. In Egypt, the god Osiris swam on a lotus leaf, and the\r\nlotus-eaters of Homer lost their love of home immediately.\r\n\r\nThese legends and odd fancies, although believed in by the populace\r\nof the Eastern nations until a late period in history, were of great\r\nantiquity and under different names of gods and plants, heroes and\r\nflowers had been handed down from the dawn of civilization. Yet this\r\nwas not all the knowledge about plants in those early years. The more\r\nthoughtful amongst men began to recognize plants by name and to study\r\ntheir uses. Some men were hunters and shepherds, but with them were those\r\nwho, with gentler spirit, tilled the ground and stored the fruits of the\r\nearth. What these were, can be learned from the pictures in Egyptian\r\npaintings. The corn of Egypt was wheat and barley, and it is interesting\r\nto know that the wheat was of a kind that must have been produced by\r\nskilled cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe vine comes early into notice in the Bible, and it had been studied,\r\nfor wine was made of its fruit. Solomon loved nature, because it brought\r\nhim into the presence of truth and beauty, and he “spoke of trees from\r\nthe cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth\r\nout of the wall.” This was part of his wisdom. And the great traveller,\r\nHerodotus, shows us that a taste for natural history had, in his time,\r\nfound a place in the mind of the Greeks—a great race who followed after\r\nthe first child-like nature-studies of the Chaldeans, Assyrians, and\r\nBabylonians had merged into real knowledge. In speaking of the luxuriant\r\nvegetation of the plains of Babylon—now dreary wastes—he is so far from\r\ndesiring to astonish merely, that he says “the blades of wheat and barley\r\nare full four fingers wide; but as to the size of the trees which grow\r\nfrom millet and sesame, though I could mention it I will not, knowing\r\nwell that those who have not been in that country will hardly believe\r\nwhat I have said already.” It is clear that when the Greeks were in the\r\nchild-like stage of plant lore, the older races had passed it, and were\r\nsuccessful cultivators of plants that had required much study to turn\r\nto use. But the Greeks soon made amends, and the teacher of Alexander\r\nthe Great, Aristoteles, tried to arrange plants, and to classify them\r\naccording to their peculiarities. Plants and herbs had been long used as\r\nmedicine, and the poisonous properties of aconite had been employed to\r\ndestroy one of the noblest men of old, before this time, so that this\r\ncelebrated naturalist had the knowledge, which had been accumulating for\r\ncenturies, to put in order and to arrange.\r\n\r\nAristoteles was born at Stageira, in the year 384 B.C., and it is\r\ninteresting to note that his wonderful love of nature was fostered by,\r\nand, indeed, probably arose from the profession of his father. His\r\nfather was the physician and friend of Amyntas, King of Macedonia, and\r\nhis mother was a descendant of the great physician Æsculapius. The young\r\nAristoteles lost both his parents at an early period of his life, but the\r\nson of Amyntas, called Philip, was his friend, and kind people brought\r\nthe boy up. We know nothing of the boy’s habits or method of life; but\r\nit can be readily understood by those who read these lives, and have had\r\na love of nature, before the experience of such a calamity as the loss\r\nof parents, that many an hour of sorrow was shortened and solaced by\r\nstudying the graceful and blooming plants and the movements and habits\r\nof animals. Certain it is that the boy loved study, and it soon became\r\nevident that his loss was compensated, as it is very often in such\r\ncases, by a spirit of self-reliance. In his eighteenth year he went to\r\nAthens to study the healing art. When Aristoteles was about twenty-one\r\nyears of age, the philosopher Plato returned from Sicily, and the young\r\nman then seems to have cared more for the study of the sciences which\r\nwere requisite for a polished physician, than for the art of healing.\r\nHe made his first self-sacrifice, as many a man has done since; he gave\r\nup the uncertainties of the art of curing diseases, and learned natural\r\nhistory and philosophy. His eagerness for knowledge and his extraordinary\r\nacuteness and sagacity doubtless attracted Plato’s notice, who soon\r\ncalled him “the intellect of the school,” and said his house was “the\r\nhouse of the reader.” As Aristoteles grew up, his early training and his\r\nlove of the truth seen in nature, began to separate him from the common\r\nrun of men, and his self-reliance began to make him an antagonist to the\r\nteachings even of the great Plato. But this opposition was not that of a\r\nvain and conceited young man. Plato had noticed his ability, and he was\r\nreally a man of mark, whose opinions were valuable. Aristoteles studied\r\nfacts, and knew many truths about natural history, but his wonderful\r\nmaster cared more for ideas. Such men must always clash, and Aristoteles\r\nwrites in one of his books about his opposition to the philosophy of\r\nPlato, that it is painful to refute the doctrine of ideas, as it has\r\nbeen introduced by persons who were his friends; “nevertheless it is a\r\nduty to disregard such private feelings, for both philosophers and truth\r\nare dear to me, but it is right to give the preference to truth.” Truth!\r\nwhat is truth? said Pilate, and turned from the true. The Creator’s\r\nlight, seen with our longing eyes, precious beyond conception, the\r\nsweetest solace of intellect; what is, what was—yet not to be defined by\r\nfinite man. The very root of science, it is that which we are to hold in\r\nour consciences against all opposition. Appreciated by the savage, dear\r\nto pagan, the pride of the Christian, the giver of confidence amongst all\r\nmen. Hard to get at, yet it is at the foundation of all those branches of\r\nknowledge which relate to the study of the Creation. Aristoteles studied\r\nnatural history, that is, the plants and animals which came before him,\r\nespecially. He recorded their description, noted their reproduction, and\r\ntried to make out their resemblances. He noticed the growth of things,\r\nand the decay of the surface of the earth, and having the facts and\r\ntruths before him, he argued upon them. His master, Plato, was not a\r\nnaturalist, but accepting the truths handed down to him by those who\r\nwere observers of nature, he generalized about them, and got ideas by\r\nthinking out the bearings of the truths. He loved the ideal, and wrote,\r\n“Behold this world! You will find that its efficient cause is God, by\r\nwhom it was brought into being; its moving cause, the goodness of the\r\nCreator.” He could no more occupy time by studying the structure of the\r\nflowers, plants, and sea-shells, than Aristoteles could in imagining or\r\nspeculating on the causes of things. Both desired the truth, and tried to\r\nget it in different manners; but as at the present day there are moral\r\nphilosophers and naturalists with totally different kinds of mind and\r\nhabits of thought, so in those old days the master and pupil never worked\r\ntogether. The master gave way to his grand imagination, and the pupil was\r\nstrictly a matter-of-fact man.\r\n\r\nAristoteles remained at Athens until he was thirty-seven years of age,\r\nwhen the death of Plato, in 347 B.C., happened. Before that time,\r\nhowever, he had become a man of note, and the Athenians sent him on an\r\nembassy to his friend and former patron, Philip of Macedon. It appears\r\nthat he was able to serve his adopted country; but he made a mistake\r\nwhich all naturalists should avoid—he became a politician. His position\r\nat Athens became uncomfortable, and he left the city after the death\r\nof Plato, and, accompanied by a fellow-disciple of the great teacher,\r\nwent into Asia Minor. They were invited by the Prince of Atarneus, named\r\nHermeias, who had received lessons from Aristoteles. This man was once\r\nthe slave of a banker, and when at Athens received a liberal education.\r\nReturning to his native country, he fought for Eubulus, the King of\r\nAtarneus, successfully against the Persians. On the death of Eubulus he\r\nwas raised to the throne, and gladly welcomed one of the men who had\r\ngiven him knowledge, and, therefore, power. The romance of Aristoteles’\r\nlife followed quickly, for, unfortunately, Hermeias was captured by\r\nthe Persians under a Greek general, after Aristoteles had been three\r\nyears with him. He was put to death, and Aristoteles fled to Mitylene,\r\nthe chief city of the neighbouring island of Lesbos. Hermeias had a\r\nsister, Pythias, and Aristoteles, knowing her excellent character and\r\ndisposition, and being aware of the sad fate which she would suffer,\r\nwere she to fall into the hands of the Persians, married her, and she\r\naccompanied him in his flight. She made him an excellent wife, and\r\nAristoteles had always a fervent and sincere affection for the patriotic\r\nand philosophical prince his friend.\r\n\r\nAfter two years’ residence in Mitylene, Aristoteles was invited by\r\nPhilip to return to Macedonia, to superintend the education of his son\r\nAlexander, the future Alexander the Great, then fourteen years old. He\r\nwas with this very able prince during about four years, and instructed\r\nhim in morality, politics, and natural history. It was a strange position\r\nfor a student of nature to occupy, and that he did his duty to his pupil\r\nis evident. It is the universal opinion that much that was admirable\r\nin the character of Alexander the Great was due to the influence of\r\nAristoteles. The great conqueror was fond of literature, delighted in\r\nphysical and even medical pursuits, sought the intimacy of men who\r\nthought, rather than that of men who had no other recommendation than\r\ntitles and riches, and was devoted to the study of nature. These were\r\nthe fruits of Aristoteles’ instruction, and it must be remembered that\r\nAlexander differed entirely in his conduct from the brutal conquerors who\r\nhave been, over and over again, the scourge and curse of mankind.\r\n\r\nAristoteles lost his wife during this time, and she left him an only\r\ndaughter. Then Philip was assassinated, and his son reigned at Macedon\r\nfor two years, and then began his great expedition into Asia. Aristoteles\r\naccompanied his pupil to Athens, and parted with him never to see him\r\nagain, but still to influence him for years. Unfortunately, however,\r\nAristoteles recommended a relation, named Callisthenes, to the young\r\nking, and it was the cause of a rupture of friendship in years to come.\r\nLeft to himself, our hero resolved to open a school for the benefit of\r\nthe Athenian youth, and to teach good learning in philosophy and nature.\r\nHe chose a house near a temple of Apollo Lyceius, which was called\r\nthe “Lyceum,” and attached to it was a garden with walks, where the\r\ninstruction was given. The Greek word for the walks was _peripatua_, and\r\nthe school was called that of the peripatetics. His habit was to give\r\none lecture in the early part of the day, on the more difficult parts\r\nof his teaching, to his more advanced students; and this was called the\r\nmorning walk, and lasted till the hour when people dressed and anointed\r\nthemselves. Another lecture, called the evening walk, was on more\r\npopular subjects, and to a larger and less select class. It was during\r\nthese thirteen years of teaching that Aristoteles composed and completed\r\nthe greater part of his works which have descended to our days. Amongst\r\nthem are treatises on natural history, the result of his own observations\r\nand of the carefully selected works of others.\r\n\r\nHis great pupil never forgot his master during his victorious career,\r\nand Alexander is said to have sent Aristoteles the enormous sum of\r\neight hundred talents to prosecute his studies in natural history. He,\r\nmoreover, ordered several thousands of persons over the whole of Greece\r\nand Asia, who lived by hunting, bird-catching, and fishing, or who\r\nhad the care of parks, herds, hives, stews, and aviaries, to furnish\r\nAristoteles with materials for a work on animals. Two volumes on plants\r\nwere written by Aristoteles, but they are lost to us; and he influenced\r\nthe botanists of his day by his great exactitude of description and\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nAristoteles’ writings and teaching embraced a great variety of subjects,\r\nand they were so genuine that he became the leader of one of the\r\nprincipal schools of Greece; and his method of study and many of his\r\nfacts and ideas have influenced mankind down to the present day. His\r\nworks were much studied during the Middle Ages, and although his books on\r\nbotany have been lost, still he influenced the study of botany through\r\nhis pupil, Theophrastus, who became the great light of after years.\r\n\r\nThere is one point about Aristoteles’ character which everybody must\r\nadmire, and it was the gratitude he felt for the good friends of his\r\nyouth and of the days of struggling upwards in his career. It has been\r\nnoticed that he was brought up by kind people. They were not relations,\r\nbut probably were appointed his guardians by his father. They were\r\nProxenus and his wife, citizens of Atarneus, who had left that city and\r\nhad been long resident in Stageira. Not only were they the good friends\r\nof the boy, but they evidently brought him in contact with Hermeias, who\r\nsubsequently became the prince of the place and Aristoteles’ fast friend\r\nand brother-in-law. Aristoteles testified his gratitude to his friends by\r\ndirecting in his will that statues of them, as well as of his parents,\r\nshould be set up at his expense. He likewise educated their son, Nicanor,\r\nto whom he gave his daughter in marriage. Whilst growing old he wrote a\r\nbeautiful poem, which is still to be read, praising the virtues of his\r\nfriend and patron, Hermeias.\r\n\r\nBut success in life is sure to produce envy and hostility, and\r\nAristoteles was no exception to this rule. A charge was made against\r\nhim of impiety, and that he had made a god of his friend Hermeias. Such\r\ncharges were not uncommon in those days. Socrates, one of the greatest\r\nand purest of men, had been accused of impiety a few years before, and\r\nthat teacher of the immortality of the soul, and the master and friend\r\nof Plato, had been condemned and poisoned. The charges were absurd\r\nenough, but the judges were ignorant, and sunk in paganism, and almost\r\ninvariably took the side of the accuser. Indeed, all through the history\r\nof the progress of the rise of civilization there were men who teaching\r\na false religion, accused the bright lights of genius, science, and\r\nwit, of irreligion. The false priest and the fighting class, with rare\r\nexceptions, have always persecuted the leaders in science, and have\r\nantagonized progress, except in their own interests.\r\n\r\nWhen the charge was made against Aristoteles, Alexander the Great was\r\ndead, and the great teacher, knowing full well what would be the result\r\nof the trial, quitted Athens and took refuge in Chalcis, in Eubœa,\r\nsaying that he wished to prevent the Athenians _twice running against\r\nphilosophy_, alluding to the judicial murder of Socrates.\r\n\r\nBut Aristoteles’ work was nearly ended, and the slightly made, delicate,\r\nand sensitive man sank during the first year of his exile, in the\r\nsixty-third year of his age.\r\n\r\nA great writer on moral philosophy, the man whose career has just been\r\nnoticed will always remain a master in natural history subjects also.\r\nHe was really a greater student of animal life than of plants; but it\r\nappears that his method of study of botany, and much of his knowledge,\r\nhave descended to us, in consequence of his careful teaching, through his\r\npupil Theophrastus. A great writer remarks that “everywhere Aristoteles\r\nobserves _the facts_ with attention; he compares them with sagacity,\r\nand endeavours to rise to the qualities they have in common.” He found\r\nthe study of plants in its very infancy and loaded with child-like and\r\nwonderful stories, and he rejected the nonsense and studied what was\r\nto be observed by any one in nature. In fact, he took the first step\r\nwhich a well-educated boy of the present century does in trying to learn\r\nnature unaided. He observed as correctly as possible, took notes of his\r\nobservations, compared the observations made on one plant with those\r\nrecorded about another, and tried to explain or discover the things which\r\nwere common to both. It must not be imagined that the botanical work\r\nof Aristoteles exists as part of the systems of botany of the present\r\nday; but he clearly gave the method of how to study, by insisting on the\r\nsuperior value of observed facts, over notions and preconceived ideas\r\nabout things. The childhood of the science passed with him.\r\n\r\nThe name of Theophrastus has been noticed as that of the pupil of\r\nAristoteles, and it is one which will always be mentioned with respect\r\nby students of natural history. He was born at Eresus, on the island of\r\nLesbos; but the date of his birth is uncertain; moreover, nothing is\r\nknown of his early youth, except that his name was Tyrtamus. His early\r\neducation must have been good, and he was sent to study at Athens by his\r\nfather, and to be a pupil of Plato. Becoming a friend of Aristoteles,\r\nthis great man, charmed with the abilities, and especially with the\r\nbeautiful pronunciation and oratory of the youth, gave him the name of\r\nTheophrastus, or one who speaks divinely. Theophrastus studied with\r\nPlato, and on the death of his master, left the academy and mixed with\r\nthe turbulent politics of the day, but in a truly patriotic spirit. He\r\nwas absent from Athens for many years, and the historian Plutarch writes\r\nthat Theophrastus delivered his country twice from the oppression of\r\ntyrants. One of the defeated at the battle of Chæronæa, Theophrastus\r\nreturned to Athens, gave up the military life, and became the favourite\r\npupil of Aristoteles in the Lyceum.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus became an earnest student of Aristoteles’ teaching, and his\r\nsingular grace of expression and knowledge of his mother tongue soon made\r\nhim a prominent philosopher.\r\n\r\nWhen Aristoteles retired, his pupil became his successor; and as he\r\ncombined the knowledge of that teacher with the eloquence of Plato, his\r\nsuccess was extraordinary. The number of his pupils, on one occasion, is\r\nsaid to have amounted to two thousand who flocked around him from all\r\nparts of Greece. He soon began to feel the effects of his well-deserved\r\nand useful success upon the envious minds of the men who had caused the\r\nretirement of Aristoteles. And this envy and malice were rendered all the\r\nmore intense because, having been a gallant soldier, and being a great\r\nteacher of advanced knowledge, Theophrastus became an authority on all\r\nintellectual subjects. A man was put forward by a party in the State,\r\nto bring the same charge of impiety against Theophrastus which had\r\nsucceeded in the instances of Socrates and Aristoteles. But Theophrastus\r\npleaded his own cause before the Areopagus with such convincing eloquence\r\nthat he was pronounced innocent. On the other hand, his accuser would\r\nhave fallen a victim to the false charge he had brought, had not his\r\nnoble-minded antagonist pleaded for his pardon.\r\n\r\nAfter this event the teacher pursued his course of public teaching and\r\nprivate research without any molestation for years. His school increased\r\nin reputation, and the most distinguished scholars of the day were\r\nmembers of it. Demetrius Phalereus, ruler of the State, was one of the\r\nstudents in his youth, and he protected Theophrastus and patronized him\r\nin every way. Botany was not the strongest subject of this great man,\r\nand probably what he knew about it was largely derived from the teaching\r\nof Aristoteles; but evidently his work on plants was one of the earliest\r\nthat was written with anything like scientific precision. Nevertheless,\r\nTheophrastus added much original matter, for he had a botanic garden, and\r\nhe collected plants during his travels in Greece. His military friends\r\nkept him supplied with specimens of Asiatic, Egyptian, and Arabian\r\nplants, and with descriptions of their natures and peculiarities, some\r\nof which were true and others quite imaginary. What was true and what\r\nwas not true was frequently a puzzle to this philosopher, as it is to\r\nmodern naturalists. He wrote, “The drug sellers and root cutters tell\r\nus some things which may be true, but other things which are merely\r\nsolemn quackery. Thus they direct us to gather some plants, standing from\r\nthe wind and with our bodies anointed; some by night, some by day, some\r\nbefore the sun falls on them. So far there may be something in their\r\nrules; but others are too fantastical and far-fetched. It is, perhaps,\r\nnot absurd to use a prayer in plucking a plant; but they go further than\r\nthis. We are to draw a sword three times round the mandragora, and to\r\ncut it looking to the west; again, to dance round it, and to use obscene\r\nlanguage, as those who sow cumin should utter blasphemies. Again, we\r\nare to draw a line round the black hellebore, standing to the east, and\r\npraying; and to avoid an eagle either on the right or on the left; for\r\nthey say if an eagle be near, the cutter will die in a year.”\r\n\r\nThis was the nonsense, out of which Theophrastus had to extricate the\r\ntrue wisdom of plants, and he tried to put aside fancies, legends, and\r\nthe opinions of men, and to puzzle out the meaning of the similarities\r\nand differences of plants, by first of all learning and describing their\r\nconstruction, habits, methods of growth, and increase.\r\n\r\nOnly a fragment of the last of ten books on plants written by\r\nTheophrastus has come down to us. The writings made such an impression\r\non the students that their general bearing has been transmitted, and the\r\nmain points are as follows. Theophrastus classified plants by the manner\r\nin which they were reproduced, the localities where they were found,\r\ntheir size, as trees or shrubs or herbs, and according to their uses, as\r\nfurnishing juices, pot-herbs, and seeds that may be eaten. The first book\r\ntreated of the parts of the plant—the root, stem, leaves, flower, and\r\nseed, and the second of the manner in which plants seed, and the proper\r\ntimes for sowing seeds, and how to sow. In this part he mentions that\r\nsome plants, evidently of the same kind, have seed and others not, or\r\nthat there are different sexes in plants, the female bearing the seed.\r\nThat he was a practical observer is proved by his writings on the method\r\nof the reproduction in the great palm trees, which are such striking\r\nfeatures in the East. Moreover, he studied the way in which figs grew and\r\nthe seed became fertile, and he compared the reproduction of the fig with\r\nthat of the palm tree. The third, fourth, and fifth books are devoted\r\nto a consideration of trees, their various kinds, the places they come\r\nfrom, and the economical uses to which they may be applied. The sixth\r\nbook treats of winter shrubs and spring plants; the seventh of pot-herbs;\r\nthe eighth of plants yielding seeds used for food; and the ninth of those\r\nplants that yield useful juices, gums, resins, and other exudations. The\r\nlove of the marvellous, however, creeps in here and there, and amongst\r\ngood facts there are very considerable “tough yarns;” but these come from\r\nthe old soldiers of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing most interesting in the works of this man, and it\r\nis the desire he had to make his knowledge useful to mankind. This is\r\nespecially noticed in another work on the causes of plants, of which\r\nsix parts remain to the present day. It is really a work on gardening\r\nand farming, with a good deal of pure and applied knowledge on botany.\r\nIt is not everybody, nowadays, that can combine what is scientific,\r\nthat is to say, exact knowledge, with useful and applied knowledge. Too\r\nfrequently the scientific botanist does not teach gardening or farming;\r\nand certainly, as a rule, the writers on these last subjects are not\r\nscientific botanists, and, indeed, they are often of a very different\r\nkind of mind. It has been said of the works of Theophrastus that there is\r\nmuch valuable matter in them that deserves the attention of the botanist,\r\nand that a very little knowledge of botany will enable the reader to\r\nseparate the chaff from the wheat.\r\n\r\nSo noted was the learning of this great man on other subjects, that his\r\ngood work on plants remained the text-book of centuries; and, in fact,\r\nlittle or no satisfactory knowledge about plants, beyond that given to us\r\nby Aristoteles and Theophrastus, was discovered for many centuries.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Demetrius from power removed the protector of Theophrastus,\r\nand the ignorant anti-educationalist party of the day revived their\r\npersecutions. In the year 305 B.C. a political noodle managed to frame a\r\nlaw, and to get it passed by the ruling body of the day, which forbade\r\nall philosophers under pain of death to give any public instruction\r\nwithout permission of the State.\r\n\r\nThis curious law was passed in order to prevent the education of the\r\npeople being advanced, and the result was that Theophrastus and several\r\nother teachers left Athens. Good sense, however, seems to have prevailed\r\nover ignorance and hostility to learning, and the law was abolished in\r\nthe following year. Moreover, the proposer of it was fined the great sum\r\nof five talents for his folly. Then Theophrastus returned to Athens, and\r\ntaught there until he died. The whole population followed his body to the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the writings of Aristoteles and Theophrastus\r\non plants, were not improved upon for many hundreds of years. They were\r\nboth observers of nature, and their works contained all the knowledge on\r\nthe subject, of their time. When the Romans obtained the supremacy in\r\nEurope, and had possessions in Asia and in Africa, men were not found\r\namongst them who could add to the knowledge of the Greeks about plants;\r\nso the books of the two great men who were the fathers of botany were\r\nsimply copied by their successors, or criticized, and doubtful novelties\r\nwere added.\r\n\r\nThere were many Roman writers on agriculture, but few wrote on the nature\r\nand structure of plants, and amongst them the most celebrated was Caius\r\nPlinius Secundus, commonly called Pliny the Elder.\r\n\r\nWhere this great man was born is not known, but possibly it was at Como.\r\nHe was of noble family, entered the army, and became a distinguished\r\nsoldier. He was appointed Augur at Rome, and subsequently had supreme\r\npower in Spain. These were not apparently the positions which were\r\nlikely to stimulate a young man of wealth to study natural history, and\r\ncertainly, in later days, the military man and active politician have\r\nnot proved, as a rule, enthusiastic students of plants and animals. Want\r\nof time and inclination are, of course, the usual excuses of such men,\r\nand the love of luxury and of intellectual idleness might be added also.\r\nNevertheless there is an instance in the case of the elder Plinius, where\r\na man, greatly and importantly occupied, spent much time in studying\r\nnature, in compiling the observations made by his predecessors, and in\r\nwriting books which have given him a fame which will last with the world.\r\nIn summer he began his work as soon as it was light; in winter, generally\r\nat one in the morning—never later than two, and sometimes earlier. No\r\nman, writes his nephew, spent less time in bed, and sometimes he would,\r\nwithout retiring from his books, indulge in a short sleep, and then\r\npursue his studies. Before daybreak he went to the Emperor Vespasian,\r\nwho chose to transact business at that hour, and when the Emperor had\r\nfinished, Plinius returned to his studies. After a slender repast at\r\nnoon, he would in the summer recline in the sun, and during the time\r\nsome book was read to him, and he made extracts from the author. He used\r\nto say that “no book was so bad but something might be learned from\r\nit.” After this he had a cold bath and took refreshment and rest. Thus\r\nreinvigorated, he resumed his studies until supper, when a book was read\r\nto him, and he made remarks on it. This, of course, must have been an\r\noccasional method of passing the day, for no man could live without some\r\nhours of exercise and sleep. Probably he retired to sleep at eight under\r\nthese circumstances, and had a good sleep in the hot hours of the day.\r\nWhen in the country all his time was devoted to study, except when he\r\nslept and bathed. He is said to have used a carriage instead of walking,\r\nand, unfortunately, but naturally, he got weak lungs and became corpulent.\r\n\r\nPlinius laboured for many years at natural history and the other\r\nsciences, and he was a most diligent collector of information. A warrior\r\nand a statesman, yet he contrived to write a vast number of works, his\r\nbooks on natural history alone amounting to twenty-seven volumes. He\r\nappears to have known all that it was possible to know at his age of\r\nthe world, and yet there was no great amount of new work put into his\r\nbooks. It has been very properly said that the loftiness of his ideas\r\nand the nobleness of his style enhance still more his profound learning.\r\nNaturally, as he copied much from other writers, and especially, in\r\none part of botany which relates to medicine, from an author named\r\nDioscorides, he could not examine into the truth of every statement which\r\nhad been made. Hence Plinius retailed some curious stories now and then,\r\nwhich are more amusing than true; but, on the whole, he established, on\r\nsolid grounds, the learning of his own and previous ages.\r\n\r\nThis active-minded man, who lived in luxury and had great\r\nresponsibilities, is an example to many of the same class who do not care\r\nto enjoy the study of the beautiful nature around them. He lost his life\r\nwhilst endeavouring to sustain the courage of his friends, during the\r\ngreat eruption of Vesuvius, when the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum\r\nwere destroyed. He was on shore at the time, and probably was suffocated\r\nby noxious fumes.\r\n\r\nThe name of Dioscorides has been mentioned as that of an author known\r\nto Plinius; he was born in Cilicia, at Anazarbus, and flourished during\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Nero. Nothing is known about his early life,\r\nbut it appears that he was a soldier, and possibly connected with the\r\nsurgical and medical art in the army. Certain it is that he travelled\r\nover many countries—Greece, Italy, Gaul, and Asia Minor—gathering plants\r\nand studying, not so much their structures and mutual resemblances and\r\ndifferences, as their medical or healing powers. He obtained plants from\r\ntravellers in India, and learned the merits of herbs and drugs from many\r\nnations. He wrote on the substances used in medicine in a Materia Medica,\r\nand named and briefly described between five and six hundred medicinal\r\nplants. Unfortunately Dioscorides wrote in a careless manner, and there\r\nis much nonsense mixed up with truth in his writings. But he was of use;\r\nhe was not merely a student of the beauties of nature, but of the value\r\nof certain plants to man in his pain and trouble, and he founded the\r\nscience of medical botany.\r\n\r\nAristoteles, Theophrastus, Plinius, and Dioscorides are the men of mark\r\nwho raised botany and plant-learning out of their infancy and gave\r\nthem a youthful vigour. They placed the method of learning, on its\r\nright basis. Instead of imagining what was true, and then collecting\r\nand studying plants to prove the correctness of the imagined notion,\r\nthey began in the opposite direction. They strove to learn and discover\r\nfacts,—truths, and then reasoned upon them. Ignorant people, and those\r\nmen who have the minds of children, always like their opinions and ideas\r\nbetter than facts, and especially if the facts will not fit in with their\r\nnotions. Such people do not know how hard it is to find out the truth\r\nin nature, how difficult it is for finite man to comprehend infinite\r\nwisdom. This was as true formerly as it is now, and hence the method of\r\nlearning, taught by the earlier of those great men, was opposed to the\r\nunderstandings of the majority of their fellow men. They troubled the\r\ncomplacent ignorance of the day, and were therefore persecuted. Like\r\nbrave men, they did not care for persecution, knowing that they did not\r\ndeserve the wicked charges brought against them; they persevered, and not\r\nonly enjoyed life much more than their opponents, but led good and useful\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThe works of these men were studied by all the learned, during fifteen\r\nhundred years and more; they were the text-books of science during what\r\nare called the dark or middle ages, and although now out of date, they\r\nwere the good seeds of knowledge, sown in difficulty, in those early days.\r\n\r\nAristoteles, Theophrastus, and Plinius were not only botanists, but\r\nnaturalists in every sense, and the first named is especially celebrated\r\nas a student of and writer upon animals; he was a great zoologist.\r\nTheophrastus knew much about geology, and so did Plinius.\r\n\r\nThese men, then, brought the science of botany out of its childhood, and\r\nsaw it partly on its way through its youth; they had removed it beyond\r\nthe fanciful ideas and strange notions of the earliest writers on the\r\nsubject, and had begun to classify plants, and to study the relations\r\nof plants to surrounding nature, and to the wants of man. Chemistry and\r\nthe use of the microscope were unknown, and therefore progress in the\r\nnecessary direction could not be made at that time of the world.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that botany does not consist in collecting,\r\ndrying, and drawing plants alone, but it relates to everything about the\r\nvegetable kingdom of nature. The growth of the plant from the seed; how\r\nit lives, breathes, and its sap circulates; how starch, and sugar, and\r\nother products are formed—have to be considered. The manner of unfolding\r\nof the flower, the anatomy of its fruits, and of the leaves and stems\r\nand root, and the method by which the kind reproduces, and the decay of\r\nthe plant have to be studied. Then the uses of plants, medicinal and as\r\nfood, have to be treated. How they can be best grown, and how plants are\r\ndistributed over the land at different heights, form other subjects; and\r\nthe arrangement of plants in a classification founded on the similarity\r\nof their most important anatomical structures, and constituting what is\r\ntermed a natural system, is one of the most necessary studies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE SCIENCE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    John Ray—Joseph de Tournefort—Their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world went to sleep for many centuries, so far as natural history and\r\nmany other things are concerned, after the time of Pliny, and sixteen\r\nhundred years elapsed before any advance was made in botanical knowledge.\r\nThis was the age when the only light on the earth was struggling\r\nChristianity, and it was shaded by superstition and violence. At last men\r\nbegan to learn Greek again, and to read the ancient authors carefully, so\r\nthat nature began to be studied. A few foreign botanists began to attempt\r\nto add to the knowledge the ancients had given them, and to classify\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nBut the first man who made a real advance, and whose work has influenced\r\nthe study of plant life down to the present day, was an Englishman,\r\nwho was bred in comparative poverty, suffered persecution, and lived a\r\nbeautiful life.\r\n\r\nThe name of this distinguished man was John Ray, and he was the son of\r\nRoger Ray and Elizabeth his wife, being born in 1628. His father was a\r\nblacksmith, of Black Notley, near Braintree, in Essex, and the boy was\r\nsent to school at the Grammar School at Braintree. There he found the\r\nkindness of Mr. Love, the master, in teaching him, a set-off against the\r\ngeneral want of education in the establishment; and he had reason to\r\nbe thankful, for before he was sixteen years of age he was sent, from\r\nthe school, to Cambridge. He entered at St. Catherine’s Hall, under the\r\ntutorship of Mr. Duckfield. But the youth did not like the Hall; he\r\nwished to study, and the inmates, he said, chiefly addicted themselves\r\nto disputations; so he went to Trinity, where he found the politer arts\r\nand sciences were principally minded and cultivated. Ray worked hard,\r\nand had an excellent tutor, who was a great Greek scholar, and soon made\r\nup for the defective teaching he had had at Braintree. He acquired much\r\nLatin and Greek, and some Hebrew, and it soon became evident that the\r\nyouth could speak well and fluently. His leisure was that of a student;\r\nhe loved to observe nature, to study the little gems of the garden and\r\ncountry, and all these things brought him speedily before the notice of\r\nthe authorities of the College. When he had been there three years, he\r\nwas elected a Minor Fellow, together with his great friend Isaac Barrow,\r\nwho had been a Charterhouse boy, and subsequently a scholar at Felsted,\r\nan Essex school. They were the favourite pupils of their master. Ray\r\ntook his degree of Bachelor of Arts, and then that of Master of Arts,\r\nbecoming then a Major Fellow. In 1651 he was chosen the Greek Lecturer\r\nto the College; two years afterwards Mathematical Lecturer, and in 1655\r\nHumanity Reader. Then he was made Junior Dean and College Steward, and\r\nhe became the tutor to many men of subsequent worth, especially to Mr.\r\nFrancis Willughby, of Middleton Hall, in Warwickshire. During these\r\nyears Ray wandered over the country collecting and studying plants.\r\nHe wrote the story of his journeys in and about England, calling them\r\n“Itineraries.” His first journey was in 1658, and he rode from Cambridge\r\nto Northampton; he passed by Higham Ferrers and saw the outside of a\r\ngreat stone building called a college, and he wrote that Northampton was\r\nindifferently handsome, the houses being built of timber, notwithstanding\r\nthe plenty of stone dug in that county. He saw in a Mr. Bowker’s garden\r\n“divers physical plants,” and he noticed the luxuriance of the lupinus\r\nthere. Then he went to Warwick by Daventry, and saw Holdenby House. At\r\nShuckborough he did not see the star-stones he had heard of. He visited\r\nWarwick, but cared more for Guy’s Cliff than for the rib of the dun cow\r\nand Guy’s sword; and then he went into Derbyshire, and investigated the\r\nPool’s-hole, near Buxton, and noticed the wild flowers of the hills.\r\nTravelling on to North Wales, he visited the brine-pits of Northwych,\r\nand at Chester he noticed the red stone of the cathedral, which he\r\nconsidered had little beauty within or without. He visited Swindon, and\r\ngot home by Shrewsbury and Gloucester. This was a journey done in the\r\nold-fashioned manner, on horseback. It opened Ray’s eyes to the immense\r\namount of nonsense that was talked about nature, and especially about\r\nany unusual natural phenomenon. He seems especially to have visited the\r\nwells and springs, and he expressed his doubts of the wonderful cures,\r\nattributing his want of belief to his scientific frame of mind.\r\n\r\nAt this period, it was usual for young men of ability and learning,\r\nthough not in orders, to deliver sermons and common-place readings, as\r\nthey were called, not only in the chapels or halls of their own colleges,\r\nbut even before the University body at St. Mary’s church. In these Ray\r\neminently distinguished himself. He was among the first who ventured\r\nto lead the attention of his hearers from the unprofitable subtleties\r\nof scholastic divinity and the trammels of the old Greek philosophy\r\nto an observation of nature and a practical investigation of truth.\r\nThe rudiments of many of his subsequent writings originated in these\r\njuvenile essays, particularly his celebrated book on the “Wisdom of God\r\nmanifested in the Works of the Creation,” known all over the world by\r\nits numerous editions and translations, and universally admired for its\r\nrational piety, sound philosophy, and solid instruction. This book is\r\nthe basis of the labours of all those divines who have made the book of\r\nnature a commentary on the book of revelation, a confirmation of truths\r\nwhich nature has not authority of herself to establish. In it the author\r\ninculcates the doctrine of a constantly superintending Providence, as\r\nwell as the advantage, and even the duty, of contemplating the works of\r\nGod. “This,” he says, “is part of the business of a Sabbath-day, as it\r\nwill be, probably, of our employment through that eternal rest of which\r\nthe Sabbath is a type.” Archbishop Tenison is recorded to have told Dr.\r\nDerham that “Mr. Ray was much celebrated in his time at Cambridge for\r\npreaching solid and useful divinity, instead of that enthusiastic stuff\r\nwhich the sermons of that time were generally filled with.” It would be\r\nrefreshing to hear a Ray in the nineteenth century. Two of his funeral\r\ndiscourses are mentioned with particular approbation; one, on the death\r\nof Dr. Arrowsmith, master of his college; the other, on that of one\r\nof his most intimate and beloved colleagues, Mr. John Nid, likewise a\r\nSenior Fellow of Trinity, who had a great share in Ray’s first botanical\r\npublication, the “Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium,”\r\nprinted in 1660 (a catalogue of plants growing around Cambridge). Before\r\nthis little volume appeared, its author had visited various parts\r\nof England and Wales for the purpose of investigating their native\r\nplants, as he did several times afterwards. Nor were his observations\r\nconfined to natural history, but extended to local and general history,\r\nantiquities, the arts, and all kinds of useful knowledge. Ray’s first\r\nbotanical tour occupied nearly six weeks, from August 9th to September\r\n18th, 1658. On the 23rd of December, 1660, he was ordained both deacon\r\nand priest at the same time by Dr. Sanderson, then Bishop of Lincoln.\r\nIn 1661 he travelled with Mr. Willughby into Scotland, returning by\r\nCumberland and Westmoreland; and the following year, with the same\r\ncompanion, he accomplished a more particular investigation of Wales. How\r\ncritically he studied the botany of the countries he visited, is evident\r\nfrom the different editions of his works called “A Catalogue of British\r\nPlants,” and “A Methodical Synopsis of British Wild Plants.” In fact, Ray\r\nfelt the necessity of being able to recognize plants by their accurate\r\ndescriptions, and saw that classification was the alphabet of the science.\r\n\r\nAll this time Mr. Ray continued to enjoy his fellowship and to cultivate\r\nhis Cambridge connections; but in September, 1662, his tranquillity\r\nwas disturbed by the too famous Bartholomew Act, by which two thousand\r\nconscientious divines were turned out of their livings, and many\r\nfellows of colleges deprived of their maintenance and means of literary\r\nimprovement. Among the latter was the subject of our memoir, with\r\nthirteen honest men at Cambridge besides, of whose names he has left us\r\na list. One of them, Dr. Dillingham, was master of Emanuel College; but\r\nRay was the only person of his own college who suffered this deprivation.\r\nOne of Ray’s biographers writes:—“The reader must not suppose that he,\r\nor perhaps any other person in this illustrious catalogue, was in the\r\nleast degree deficient in attachment to the doctrine or discipline of the\r\nChurch of England, or that they had taken the oath, called the Solemn\r\nLeague and Covenant, which Ray certainly had neither taken nor even\r\napproved. They were required to swear to the infamous proposition that\r\nthe said oath was not binding to those who had taken it, and on this\r\nground they conscientiously gave up their preferment.” It is curious to\r\nread the apology made for Ray, to Dr. Derham on this subject, by a Mr.\r\nBrokesby, “that he was at that time absent from his college, where he\r\nmight have met with satisfaction to his scruples, and was among some\r\nzealous nonconformists who too much influenced him by the addition of\r\nnew scruples. And we may also ascribe somewhat to the prejudice of\r\neducation in unhappy times.” By this it appears that the “scruples” of\r\nnonconformists were most favourable to the sanctity of an oath, and that\r\nthe “unhappy times” alluded to were more advantageous to principle than\r\nthe golden days of Charles II., whose ministers doubtless valued the\r\nobedience far more than the honesty of any man; nor was this taste by any\r\nmeans peculiar to them or their profligate master.\r\n\r\nMr. Ray (or, as he wrote his name for a while about this period, Wray),\r\nhaving thus the world before him, made an arrangement with Mr. Willughby\r\nfor a tour on the Continent; and in this plan two of his pupils were\r\nincluded, Mr. Nathaniel Bacon and Mr., afterwards Sir Philip, Skippon.\r\nThey sailed for Calais in April, 1663, but being prevented by the state\r\nof political affairs from prosecuting their journey through France,\r\nthey traversed the Low Countries and Germany, proceeding by Venice into\r\nItaly, most of whose cities they visited, either by sea or land, as well\r\nas Malta and Sicily; and returned by Switzerland, through France, into\r\nEngland in the spring of 1666.\r\n\r\nMr. Willughby, indeed, separated from the rest of the party at\r\nMontpellier, and visited Spain. An ample account of their observations\r\nwas published by Ray in 1673, making a thick octavo volume. The\r\ntravellers studied politics, literature, natural history, mechanics, and\r\nphilosophy, as well as antiquities and other curiosities; but in the\r\nfine arts they assume no authority, nor display any considerable taste\r\nor knowledge. Mr. Willughby’s account of Spain makes a part by itself,\r\nand a rich critical catalogue of such plants, not, for the most part,\r\nnatives of England, as were observed in this tour, concludes the volume.\r\nThere is no doubt that Ray has the credit of having discovered several\r\nspecies of plants in Switzerland not previously known to belong to that\r\ncountry. Ray passed the summer of 1666 partly at Black Notley, and partly\r\nin Sussex, studying chiefly the works of Hook, Boyle, Sydenham, on\r\nfevers, and the “Philosophical Transactions,” “making few discoveries,”\r\nsays he, “save of mine own errors.” The following winter he was employed\r\nat Mr. Willughby’s, in arranging that gentleman’s museum of seeds, dried\r\nplants, birds, fishes, shells, and other objects of natural history and\r\ncoins, and in forming tables of plants and animals for the use of Dr.\r\nWilkins. He began to arrange a catalogue of the English native plants\r\nwhich he had gathered, rather for his own use than with any immediate\r\nview of publication at present. He wrote to Dr. Lister, “The world is\r\nglutted with bungling;” “I resolve never to put out anything which is\r\nnot as perfect as is possible for me to make it. I wish you would take a\r\nlittle pains this summer about grasses, that so we might compare notes.”\r\nThe above resolution of our author is no doubt highly commendable, but\r\nthe world has rather to lament that so many able men have formed the\r\nsame determination, at least in natural science. If it were universally\r\nadhered to, scarcely any work would see the light, for few can be so\r\nsensible of the defects of any other person’s attempt to illustrate the\r\nworks of nature, as a man of tolerable judgment must be of his own.\r\nThis is especially the case with those who, like Ray, direct their\r\naspiring views towards system and philosophical theory. Happily he did\r\nnot try this arduous path, till he had trained himself by wholesome\r\npractical discipline in observation and experience. His first botanical\r\nworks assumed the humble form of alphabetical catalogues. His and Mr.\r\nWillughby’s labours in the service of Bishop Wilkins were, indeed, of a\r\nsystematical description, and accordingly the authors themselves were\r\nprobably more dissatisfied than any other persons with their performance.\r\nThey relaxed from these labours in a tour of practical observation\r\nthrough the west of England, as far as the Land’s End, in the summer\r\nof 1667, and returning by London, Mr. Ray was solicited to become a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society, into which learned body he was admitted\r\nNovember 7th. Being now requested by his friend Wilkins to translate his\r\ncelebrated work, “An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical\r\nLanguage,” into Latin, he undertook, and by degrees accomplished, that\r\narduous performance. The following summer was agreeably spent in visits\r\nto various literary friends, and in a solitary journey to the north. His\r\nformer companion, Willughby, being just married, stayed at home; but Ray\r\njoined him in September, 1668, and remained for most part of the ensuing\r\nwinter and spring.\r\n\r\nThe seclusion and leisure of the country, with the converse and\r\nassistance of such a friend, were favourable to the prosecution of a\r\nnew subject of inquiry, which now strongly attracted the attention of\r\nour great naturalist—the theory of vegetation. The first step of the\r\ntwo philosophers in this little-explored path was an examination of\r\nthe motion of the sap in trees; and the result of their inquiries,\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society, appeared soon after in the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions.” Their experiments clearly prove the\r\nascent of the sap through the woody part of the tree, which is easily\r\ndetected by boring the trunks at different depths before their leaves\r\nare unfolded; and they observed, also, the mucilaginous nature of the\r\nflowing sap, “precipitating a kind of white coagulum or jelly, which,”\r\nsays Ray, in a note preserved by Derham, “may be well conceived to be\r\nthe part, which every year, between bark and tree turns to wood, and\r\nof which the leaves and fruits are made. And it seems to precipitate\r\nmore when the tree is just ready to put out leaves and begins to cease\r\ndropping, than at its first bleeding.” The accuracy of the leading facts\r\nrecorded by these ingenious men is confirmed by subsequent observers,\r\nwho have further pursued the same subject, which is now sufficiently\r\nwell understood. The sap originates in the liquid matters which are\r\nabsorbed by the roots of plants; they enter the minute cells of the ends\r\nof the roots and permeate the cellular tissue. This sap ascends in the\r\nplant, assisted by the evaporation from the leaves. The sap ascends with\r\nconsiderable rapidity to the leaves, where it is subject to changes, the\r\nresult of physiological action. It descends from the leaves, having had\r\nits chemical constitution altered, and is fit for the nutrition of the\r\nplant. The sap ascends through the cellular and woody tissue, especially\r\nin the layers of wood not more than two years old. The hard heartwood\r\ndoes not convey sap, but in some trees, like the poplar, sap moves in the\r\nvery centre.\r\n\r\nThe elaborated sap returns from the leaves in a slow stream, through the\r\ndelicate cellular structures of the bark, right down to the root, giving\r\nrise to the cambium layer, from the inner surface of which the annual\r\nlayer of young wood is formed.\r\n\r\nAt this time Ray began to prepare for the press his “Collection of\r\nProverbs,” a curious book in its way, by which he is perhaps better known\r\nto the generality of his countrymen, than by any other of his literary\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nThe first edition was published in 1672, but the work was subsequently\r\nmuch enlarged, and the author may almost be said to have exhausted his\r\nsubject. From its very nature, delicacy and refinement had often to be\r\ndispensed with, but this is evidently not the fault or the aim of the\r\nwriter. His learning and critical acuteness diffuse light over the whole,\r\nand make us overlook the coarse vehicle of our instruction. The first\r\nedition of the “Catalogue of English Plants,” already mentioned, came\r\nout in 1670, and the second in 1677. Their great author gave his work\r\nto the world with that diffidence for which he alone, perhaps, could\r\nperceive any just foundation. It was a wonderful book, considering that\r\nthere was no recognized authority to help the author, who, seeing that\r\nthere must be some real method in nature, strove to arrange or classify\r\nplants by the similarity or dissimilarity of those structures which\r\nwere of the greatest importance. About this period the health of Mr. Ray\r\nseems to have been considerably impaired. He refused a tempting offer\r\nto travel again on the Continent, as tutor to three young noblemen; nor\r\ncould the powerful attractions of Alpine botany, which was then to be\r\nstudied, overcome that reluctance to leaving home, which arose from a\r\nfeeble state of body. Indeed, this very reluctance or listlessness is\r\naccounted for by the turn which his disorder took, as it terminated in\r\nthe jaundice. After this depressing complaint had left him, Ray resumed\r\nhis botanical travels at home with fresh alacrity, visiting the rich\r\nstores of the north of England, with a companion named Thomas Willisel,\r\nwhose name and discoveries he subsequently gratefully commemorated on\r\nmany occasions. Nothing forms a more striking feature in Ray’s character\r\nthan the unreserved and abundant commendation which he always gave to\r\nhis friends and fellow-labourers. Then unfortunately an event occurred\r\nwhich called forth his affectionate feelings. On the 3rd of July, 1672,\r\nMr. Willughby was unexpectedly carried off by an acute disorder, in the\r\nthirty-seventh year of his age. The care of his two infant sons was\r\nconfided by himself to Mr. Ray, who was also appointed one of his five\r\nexecutors, and to whom he left an annuity of sixty pounds for life. The\r\neldest of these youths was created a baronet at the age of ten years, but\r\ndied before he was twenty. Their sister, Cassandra, afterwards married\r\nthe Duke of Chandos. Thomas, the younger son, was one of the ten peers\r\ncreated, all on the same day, by Queen Anne, and received the title of\r\nLord Middleton. The care of his pupils, and of the literary concerns of\r\ntheir deceased parent, now interrupted Mr. Ray’s botanizing excursions,\r\nand caused him also to decline the offer of Dr. Lister, then a physician\r\nat York, to settle under his roof. Bishop Wilkins did not long survive\r\nMr. Willughby, and his death made another chasm in the scientific and\r\nsocial circle of our great natural philosopher, who felt these losses\r\nas deeply and tenderly as any man. He sought consolation in a domestic\r\nattachment, fixing his choice on a young woman of good parentage, whose\r\nname was Margaret Oakley, and who resided in the family at Middleton\r\nHall. He was married at the parish church, June 5th, 1673, being then in\r\nthe forty-fifth year of his age, and his bride about twenty. This lady\r\ntook a share in the early education of his pupils, as far as concerned\r\ntheir reading English. She is said to have been recommended by her\r\ncharacter, as well as by her person, to the regard of her husband. She\r\nbore him three daughters who, with their mother, survived him.\r\n\r\nThe first fruit of our author’s leisure and retirement was a book on\r\na new classification of plants, published in 1682. His principles\r\nof arrangement are chiefly derived from the fruit. The regularity\r\nand irregularity of flowers, which took the lead in the system of\r\ncontemporary botanists, made no part of that of Ray. It is remarkable\r\nthat he adopts the ancient primary division of plants into trees, shrubs,\r\nand herbs, and that he blamed Rivinus, one of his fellow-labourers,\r\nfor abolishing it, though his own prefatory remarks tend to overset\r\nthat principle, as a vulgar and casual one, unworthy of a philosopher.\r\nThat his system was not merely a commodious artificial aid to practical\r\nbotany, but a philosophical clue to a correct natural classification, he\r\nprobably, like his fellow-labourers for many years in this department,\r\nbelieved, yet he was too modest and too learned to think he had\r\nbrought the new and arduous design to perfection. For whatever he\r\nhas incidentally or deliberately thrown out respecting the value of\r\nhis labours, is often marked with more diffidence on the subject of\r\nclassification than any other. The great service that Ray did to botany\r\nwas the foreshadowing the so-called natural system of classification,\r\nwhich was to supersede the artificial system of Linnæus, which will be\r\ndescribed in a future page. He first applied his system to practical\r\nuse in a general “History of Plants,” of which the first volume, a\r\nthick folio, was published in 1686, and the second in 1687. The third\r\nvolume of the same work, which is supplementary, came out in 1704. This\r\nvast and critical compilation is still in use as a book of reference,\r\nbeing particularly valuable as an epitome of the contents of various\r\nrare and expensive works, which ordinary libraries cannot possess. The\r\ndescription of species is faithful and instructive, the remarks original,\r\nbounded only by the whole circuit of the botanical learning of that day;\r\nnor are generic characters neglected, however vaguely they are assumed.\r\nSpecific differences do not enter regularly into the author’s plan, nor\r\nhas he followed any uniform rules of nomenclature. So ample a transcript\r\nof the practical knowledge of such a botanist cannot but be a treasure;\r\nyet it is now much neglected, few persons being learned enough to use it\r\nwith facility for want of figures and a popular nomenclature; and those\r\nwho are, seldom requiring its assistance.\r\n\r\nBut if the fame or the utility of Ray’s botanical work has neither of\r\nthem been commensurate with the expectations that might have been formed,\r\na little octavo volume which he gave to the world in 1690, amply supplied\r\nall such defects, and proved the great corner-stone of his reputation in\r\nthis department of science. This was “A Methodical Synopsis of British\r\nWild Plants.” The two editions of his alphabetical catalogue of English\r\nplants being sold off, and some pettifogging reasons of his booksellers\r\nstanding in the way of a third, with any improvements, he remodelled the\r\nwork, throwing it into a systematic form, revising the whole, supplying\r\ngeneric characters, with numerous additions of species and various\r\nemendations and remarks. The uses and medicinal qualities of the plants\r\nare removed to the alphabetical index at the end. A second edition of\r\nthis “Synopsis” was published in 1693, but its author never prepared\r\nanother. The third, now most in use, was edited twenty-eight years\r\nafterward by Dillenius. Of all the systematical and practical floras of\r\nany country the second edition of Ray’s “Synopsis” was the most perfect\r\nof his time, and for many a long year afterwards. “He examined every\r\nplant recorded in his work, and even gathered most of them himself. He\r\ninvestigated their different names with consummate accuracy; and if the\r\nclearness and precision of other authors had equalled his, he would\r\nscarcely have committed an error. It is difficult to find him in a\r\nmistake or misconception respecting nature herself, though he sometimes\r\nmisapprehends the bad figures or lame descriptions he was obliged to\r\nconsult.” Above a hundred species are added in this second edition, and\r\nthe cryptogamic plants in particular are more amply elucidated. The\r\nwork led to much disputing, but Ray took no delight in controversy; its\r\ninevitable asperities were foreign to his nature. One of the biographers\r\nof Ray writes: “We must not omit to notice that in the preface to\r\nboth editions of his ‘Synopsis’ the learned author, venerable for his\r\ncharacter, his talents, and his profession, as well as by his noble\r\nadherence to principle in the most corrupt times, has taken occasion\r\nto congratulate his country, and to pour out his grateful effusions to\r\nDivine Providence in a style worthy of Milton for the establishment of\r\nreligion, law, and liberty by the revolution which placed King William\r\non the throne. An honest Englishman, however retired in his habits and\r\npursuits, could not have withheld this tribute at such a time, nor was\r\nany loyalty ever more personally disinterested than that of Ray.” The\r\nyear 1690 was the date of the first publication of his noble work on “The\r\nWisdom of God in Creation,” of which we have already spoken, and whose\r\nsale through many editions was very extensive. In 1700 he printed a book\r\nmore exclusively within the sphere of his sacred profession, called “A\r\nPersuasive to a Holy Life,” a rare performance of the kind at that day,\r\nbeing devoid of enthusiasm, mysticism, or cant, as well as of religious\r\nbigotry or party spirit, “and employing the plain and solid arguments\r\nof reason for the best of purposes.” His three “Physico-Theological\r\nDiscourses concerning the Chaos, Deluge, and Dissolution of the World,”\r\nof which the original materials had been collected and prepared formerly\r\nat Cambridge, came out in 1692, and were reprinted the following year. A\r\nthird edition, superintended by Derham, was published in 1713. This able\r\neditor took up the same subject himself, in a similar performance, the\r\nmaterials of which, like Ray’s, were first delivered in sermons at Bow\r\nchurch, he having been appointed reader of Mr. Boyle’s lectures.\r\n\r\nRay studied animals as carefully as he did plants, and his influence\r\non zoology will be noticed further on in this book, and he revised a\r\ntranslation of Rauwolff’s travels, and gave a catalogue of Grecian,\r\nSyrian, Egyptian, and Cretan plants. Ever wishing for the truth, he was\r\nled during a correspondence with Rivinus, a foreign botanist, to revise\r\nhis system of the classification of plants, and to include that of his\r\nfriend in it. Ray was impressed with the greater importance of the seeds\r\nand fruits of plants in classification than of the leaves and floral\r\nenvelopes; Rivinus and others believed in the superior importance of\r\nthe flower as a means of distinguishing and grouping plants. After due\r\nconsideration, Ray included part of the plan of his friend, but it is\r\ncertain that plants cannot be safely grouped, in every instance, by the\r\nsimilarity of their flowers.\r\n\r\nAll this correspondence and alteration of systems was extremely useful,\r\nfor it led to the foundation of what is called the natural system of\r\nclassification, in opposition to the artificial style, which was founded\r\nby the great man whose life will be noticed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nRay lived a long, happy, and useful life, and died at Black Notley, in\r\na house of his own building, in 1705, in the seventy-seventh year of\r\nhis age. A friend wrote of him: “In his dealings, no man more strictly\r\njust; in his conversation, no man more humble, courteous, and affable;\r\ntowards God no man more devout; and towards the poor and distressed no\r\nman more compassionate and charitable according to his abilities.” He\r\nwas buried, according to his own wish, at Black Notley; but he would not\r\nhave his body buried in the chancel of the church, choosing rather to\r\nrepose with his ancestors in the churchyard. Ray died rich in honours,\r\nbut not rich in money, as he had to give up his living in the Church for\r\nconscience’ sake and conform as a layman. He was singularly charitable in\r\nhis opinions to others; and as his work has lasted until the present day,\r\nand has influenced the progress of natural history, England may well be\r\nproud of the blacksmith’s son.\r\n\r\nJoseph Pitton de Tournefort was born at Aix, in France, in 1656. He was\r\nof a noble family, and was educated with care, and had all the comforts\r\nof life. Living, however, far away from the gay scenes of Paris and in a\r\ncountry town, Tournefort soon began to wander over the fields by himself,\r\nand, like most boys, he loved to gather flowers. More than this, he began\r\nto study them. But such pleasures were not to be his at once, for his\r\nparents destined him to be a priest, and he was obliged to enter the\r\nCatholic seminary at Aix. There he began to learn Latin, and in course\r\nof time became a great proficient, speaking and writing that language\r\nwell, which at that time was fairly known by every educated person. His\r\ntheological studies were rather neglected by him, and whenever he had the\r\nopportunity, he got books on natural philosophy, chemistry, medicine,\r\nand, above all, on botany. He studied them with great assiduity, and\r\nuntil he was twenty-one years of age. Tournefort’s father died in 1677,\r\nand the young man then being independent, threw off his cap and gown,\r\nsaid good-bye to the seminary and its priests, and devoted himself\r\nforthwith and as long as life lasted to the science of natural history,\r\nand especially to botany.\r\n\r\nHe did not rest satisfied with the books of Plinius and Aristoteles, or\r\nof the feeble botanists of his youth, but he intended to study plants\r\nas they grew, to discover their uses, and to endeavour to classify and\r\nname them. Besides, he got a love for the healing art, for one of his\r\nfirst teachers was a chemist of Aix, who gave him lessons about the\r\ncommon simple plants which were used in medicine. So, after roaming\r\nover the country far and wide, month after month, and collecting\r\nplants in Provence, on the mountains of Dauphiné and Savoy, he went to\r\nMontpellier in 1679 to study anatomy and medicine. The young student\r\nwas there for two years, and then he seems to have set the example to\r\nhis fellow-students, for botanical excursions became a favourite method\r\nof passing away time. In 1681, in company with several fellow-students,\r\nhe went to the Pyrenees, and wandered about those difficult mountains,\r\nsubmitting to much fatigue, cold, and hunger. Very robust in health,\r\nand vigorous, his fatigues and hard fare seemed to do him good, and at\r\nlast he obtained a very fine collection of the plants of that region.\r\nIt is always told that the ardent young botanist and his friends got\r\ninto trouble, being taken prisoners more than once by _Miguelites_\r\n(smugglers); but it is not likely that those people got much out of them.\r\n\r\nOn his return home he found that his reputation as a practical botanist\r\nand as knowing useful plants, had spread about, although he had not\r\nwritten any work at that time. M. Fagon, a distinguished botanist of\r\nthe age, was physician to Louis XIV., and had had many an excursion to\r\ncollect plants in Provence, Languedoc, and Auvergne, before he became\r\na great man at court. He got plants from those localities, and had\r\nthem planted in the botanic gardens, of which the king was fond; and,\r\nfortunately for his prospects in life, he discovered the medicinal uses\r\nof some natural baths at Barèges, which he recommended to the Duc de\r\nMaine. On his return to Paris, M. Fagon was made professor of botany and\r\nchemistry to the Jardin des Plantes, and subsequently became physician\r\nto the king and princes, and director of the gardens. M. Fagon wanted\r\nhelp, for little was known about the plants of the countries beyond\r\nEurope, and he sought the services of a young and wise botanist who had\r\nplenty of energy. He destined young Tournefort for a great career, and\r\noffered him the professorship of the Botanic garden, intending that\r\nthe young teacher, after a while, should travel, and collect for the\r\ngarden. Finding the prospects good, Tournefort accepted the position, and\r\ndesirous of adding to the collection of plants, visited Spain again, and\r\nthen Portugal. Subsequently he came over to England, and then collected\r\nin Holland. His name was well known as that of a practical botanist,\r\nand the Dutch offered him a professorship at Leyden. He was elected\r\nto the highest scientific honour in France—to the membership of the\r\nAcademy of Science. Two years afterwards Tournefort published his first\r\nand great work, “The Elements of Botany, or a method of Distinguishing\r\nPlants.” This work established his reputation all over Europe. It was\r\na very remarkable book. Tournefort travelled in Asia Minor, Circassia,\r\nGeorgia, Northern Assyria, Candia, and Greece, and was the first man\r\nwho gave publicity to the truth that the same plants are not found in\r\nall countries, and that most countries have many plants peculiar to\r\nthem. He may be said to have founded the science of the geographical\r\ndistribution of plants. His descriptions of plants were 10,000 in number;\r\ntheir arrangement in species and genera was excellent. Less praise must\r\nbe given about the manner of his separating the greater divisions of\r\nthe plants one from the other. Nevertheless, much of the work of this\r\ngreat traveller has lasted until the present day as good science. Plants\r\nare arranged in species, which consist of individuals, having a close\r\nstructural resemblance without any constant differences of the form\r\nof the stem, roots, leaves, flowers, and seeds. A genus is a group of\r\nspecies with a general resemblance, some special character predominating.\r\nAn order is a number of more or less similar genera, and a class contains\r\norders which have greater resemblance than those of another class.\r\n\r\nAll this classification relates to accurate observation and description,\r\nand then to comparison, and the greater the knowledge of the botanist\r\nof species and genera the more useful it is. There is a difficulty in\r\nselecting those parts of a plant which should be those on which the\r\nclassification should depend, and this was the stumbling-block with these\r\nearly botanists. Ray saw the value of the seed and of the reproductive\r\norgans in classification, and Tournefort, although he erred in\r\nclassifying his “classes” by the coloured part of the flower or corolla,\r\nfollowed nature accurately in his description, and reasoned upon the\r\nfacts he had discovered.\r\n\r\nThis botanist, who lived in the days of great luxury, and when war\r\nwas almost constant, pursued his useful and simple career, and by his\r\ncollections alone, assisted in laying the foundations of botany as a\r\nscience. His travels in the East read like romances, for the habits\r\nof Eastern nations were then but little known; and, moreover, the\r\ndiligent student was a scholar, and paid great attention to the splendid\r\nantiquities which he constantly saw. Tournefort studied the zoology of\r\nthe countries he passed through, and was an adept in mineralogy. On\r\nhis return from his long journey in the East he was made Professor of\r\nMedicine to the College de France. For the future his life was destined\r\nto be quiet, happy it appears always to have been. Year after year he\r\nlaboured in arranging, cultivating, and describing the treasure of plants\r\nhe had brought from the East and elsewhere. Moreover, he taught as\r\nprofessor. His end was sudden, for he met with an accident in the street,\r\nand was killed by a passing waggon.\r\n\r\nTournefort’s important work was the forming a great amount of good\r\nknowledge about the species of plants, and the arranging them in a\r\nsystematic order. But, as has been mentioned, he was a founder of the\r\nscience of the distribution of plants. He appears to have laboured\r\nindependently of Ray, his English fellow-botanist, whose method was the\r\nbest of the two. There are twenty-two classes in Tournefort’s method,\r\nchiefly arranged, as has been stated, by the form of the corolla,\r\ncomparatively an unimportant structure. He distinguishes herbs and\r\nunder-shrubs on the one hand, from trees and shrubs on the other. His\r\nsystem of classification was much used on the Continent, until it was\r\nfound to be less easy of application than that of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nThe life of Ray, by Dr. Derham and Sir J. E. Smith, is to be found in the\r\n“Memorials of John Ray,” in the publications of the Ray Society, 1846.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF LINNÆUS.\r\n\r\n    The science of plants begins to mature, to be reformed, and to\r\n    be made more exact.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarl Linnæus was born in the month of May, 1707, at Rashult, in the\r\nparish of Stenbrohult, in Smaland, a province in the South of Sweden. His\r\nfather, Nils Linnæus, was assistant minister of the parish, and became,\r\nin process of time, its pastor or rector, having married the daughter of\r\nhis predecessor.[1]\r\n\r\nOur Carl was the firstborn child of this marriage. The family of Linnæus\r\nhad been peasants, and a remarkably lofty linden tree, growing near their\r\nnative place, is reputed to have given origin to the names of Lindelius,\r\nor Tiliander (linden tree man). This origin of surnames taken from\r\nnatural objects is not uncommon in Sweden.\r\n\r\nOf his father, Linnæus has given us a few glimpses in his diary, which\r\nprepossess us in his favour, and make us wish that we knew more of the\r\nworthy pastor. He was brought up by his maternal uncle, Sven Tiliander,\r\nhimself a clergyman, who educated the lad with his own children, and,\r\nbeing fond of plants and gardening, inspired in his nephew also a love\r\nfor horticulture; so that this predilection appears to have been, in\r\nsome degree, hereditary. Young Nils was sent, in due time, to school,\r\nand afterwards to the University of Lund, where he had to struggle, for\r\nsome years, with poverty, and to apply very diligently to his studies,\r\nin order that he might qualify himself for the profession of his choice.\r\nReturning to his native place, he was admitted to holy orders, and was\r\nfirst curate, and afterwards co-pastor. Soon after he attained to this\r\ndegree, he was married to the eldest daughter of the pastor, Christina\r\nBrodersonia, of whom her son says—“She possessed all the virtues of her\r\nsex, and was an excellent economist.” No doubt she found ample room for\r\nthe exercise of this her distinguishing excellence, for her husband’s\r\nstipend was small, and she brought him a goodly family of two sons and\r\nthree daughters. We may well believe that thrift and frugality were\r\nnecessary in the _ménage_ of this small household. Linnæus tells us that\r\nthe young couple welcomed their firstborn with joy, and reared him with\r\nthe tenderest solicitude, “devoting the utmost attention to impressing on\r\nhis mind the love of virtue, both in precept and example.” He has drawn\r\na charming picture of his birthplace; it was situated in a very pleasant\r\nvalley adjoining the lake Möklen, which formed a bay, in the centre of\r\nwhich stood the parish church of Stenbrohult. On the banks of this fine\r\nlake, surrounded by hills and valleys, woods and cultivated grounds, the\r\nfather of Linnæus dwelt; his garden and his fields yielding him, at the\r\nsame time, both amusement and profit. The young Carl had no sooner left\r\nhis cradle than he was constantly in the garden, in which, to use his\r\nown expression, he almost lived, delighted with the brilliant hues and\r\nfragrance of the beauteous shrubs and flowers which flourished there.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Baron Haller, written at the time of his father’s death,\r\nLinnæus says: “He was an uncommon lover of plants, and had a select\r\ngarden of numerous rare species.” The favourite taste of the father was\r\nquickly imbibed by the child, who was his constant companion while he\r\ncultivated the choice parterre, and eagerly tried to yield such slight\r\naid as his childish powers permitted. He has recorded the first occasion\r\nwhen this innate passion was decidedly displayed, or rather, perhaps,\r\nwhen it sprung into consciousness. He was hardly four years old when\r\nhe chanced to accompany his father to a rural fête at Möklen, and in\r\nthe evening, it being a pleasant season of the year, the guests seated\r\nthemselves on the flowery turf and listened to the good pastor, who\r\nentertained them with remarks on the names and properties of the plants\r\nwhich grew around them, showing them the roots of succisa, tormentilla,\r\norchides, etc. The little Carl attended with the utmost eagerness to all\r\nhe saw and heard, and “from that time never ceased harassing his father\r\nwith questions about the name, qualities, and nature of every plant he\r\nmet with.” An unlooked-for result of the evening lecture, and which seems\r\nto have cost the worthy man no small trouble, for the child (not unlike\r\nother children, for that matter) very often asked more than his father\r\nwas able to answer; in addition to which he “used immediately to forget\r\nall he had learned, and especially the names of plants.” To cure him\r\nof this mischievous habit of inattention his father refused to answer\r\nhis questions unless he would promise to remember what was told him,\r\nwhich judicious management wrought a speedy and effectual cure, insomuch\r\nthat he tells us he ever afterwards retained with ease, whatever he\r\nheard. Besides this retentiveness of memory he possessed an “astonishing\r\nquickness of sight,” an almost necessary qualification for the study of\r\nhis favourite science.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy was eight years old a separate plot of ground was assigned\r\nhim by his father, which was called “Carl’s garden,” and which he soon\r\nstored with collections of plants and wild flowers, gathered from the\r\nwoods and fields around his dwelling. At the same time he introduced a\r\nvariety of weeds, a treasure which it afterwards cost his father no\r\nsmall pains to eradicate from his flower-beds. The enterprising youngster\r\neven tried the experiment of establishing a swarm of wild bees and wasps\r\nin the garden, the result of which was a devastating warfare waged\r\nagainst the domestic hives.\r\n\r\nAt length it was thought desirable that these flowery pursuits should\r\ngive way to more serious occupations, and he was committed to the charge\r\nof a private tutor, whom he calls “a passionate and morose man, better\r\ncalculated for extinguishing a youth’s talents than for improving them.”\r\nNor did he fare any better in his next remove, which was to the grammar\r\nschool at Wexiö, where the masters “pursued the same methods, preferring\r\nstripes and punishments to encouragements and admonitions.” Probably the\r\nboy evinced his distaste for such coercive measures, since we find him\r\nsoon removed from school to the care of another private teacher, of whose\r\nmild and gentle disposition he speaks in terms of approval. Nevertheless,\r\nhe too failed to inspire in his pupil a love for the studies which were\r\nconsidered necessary as preparatory to admission into holy orders; for\r\nNils Linnæus, desirous that his eldest son should become his assistant\r\nand eventually his successor, designed him for the Church. The boy had\r\nto work for three years before he was promoted to a higher “form” in\r\nthe school, called the “circle;” and the principal use he seems to have\r\nmade of the greater liberty allowed him in this new rank, was to shun\r\nthe usual exercises and give himself up to the study of his favourite\r\npursuit—the knowledge of flowers. He acknowledges that his time was\r\nchiefly spent in wandering about the outskirts of the town, and making\r\nhimself acquainted with all the plants he could find. According to the\r\nsystem then pursued in Sweden, it was necessary that youths should pass\r\nfrom the schools or private tutors to a superior seminary, called the\r\nGymnasium, where the higher branches of literature were taught; and\r\naccordingly, at the age of seventeen, the young Linnæus was removed\r\nthither. But the original predilections of his mind were then still more\r\nstrikingly evinced and matured. He showed the strongest distaste for\r\ntheological studies. In the metaphysics, ethics, Greek and Hebrew, and\r\ntheology his companions far outstripped him; but in mathematics, and\r\nparticularly physics, he as much excelled them. His favourite science,\r\nbotany, which at that time was wholly neglected, still continued to\r\nbe his most engrossing pursuit, and he soon contrived to form a small\r\nlibrary of books in that branch. Among others he mentions the “Chloris\r\nGothica” of Bromelius, and Rudbeck’s “Hortus Upsaliensis,” which he\r\nconfesses his inability then to comprehend clearly. Nevertheless he says\r\nhe “continued to read them day and night, and committed them to memory.”\r\nHis own copies of these books, “used with the utmost care and neatness,”\r\nwere preserved among his library, and after his death were sold with his\r\ncollection. The zeal and eagerness he evinced in these studies procured\r\nhim, both among masters and scholars, the name of “the Little Botanist.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of two years his father went to Wexiö, “hoping to hear from\r\nthe preceptors the most flattering account of his beloved son’s progress\r\nin his studies and morals.” But he was sorely disappointed at learning\r\nthat, unexceptionable as the general behaviour of the youth had been,\r\nhe was evidently quite unfit for a divine; and, indeed, in the opinion\r\nof the authorities, it was a pity to incur any further expense towards\r\ngiving him a learned education, some manual employment being far more\r\nsuitable for him. The youth, they thought, would be well placed as\r\napprentice to some tailor or shoemaker!\r\n\r\nGrieved at having thus lost his labour, and supported his son at school\r\nfor twelve years (an expense he could very ill afford) to no purpose,\r\nthe venerable clergyman went his way, pondering what course to pursue.\r\nIt chanced that he was suffering from a complaint which required\r\nmedical advice, and he betook himself to the house of Dr. Rothmann, the\r\nprovincial physician, also a lecturer in physics, to whom, in the course\r\nof conversation, he mentioned his perplexity with reference to his son\r\nCarl. Rothmann suggested that, though the opinions of his colleagues\r\nmight be correct as to the boy’s inaptitude for theological studies,\r\nthere was good reason to believe he might distinguish himself in the\r\nprofession of medicine, and possibly that he might accomplish great\r\nthings in the pursuit of natural history. At the same time he liberally\r\noffered, in case the father’s circumstances did not permit him to\r\nmaintain his son in a course of studies, to take him into his own house,\r\nand provide for him during the year he must remain at the gymnasium.\r\n\r\nThis generous proposal was gratefully accepted, and the result was most\r\nsatisfactory. Linnæus received from his benefactor a course of private\r\ninstructions in physiology with so much success, that the youth was able\r\nto give a most accurate report of all he had been taught. At the same\r\ntime, this worthy teacher put him into the right method of studying\r\nbotany, showing the necessity of proceeding in a scientific manner,\r\nand directing his attention to the system of Tournefort. The very\r\nimperfections he found in this work stimulated his desire for something\r\nmore perfect, and were, in this way, of use to the future naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe year following (1727) Linnæus proceeded to the University at Lund,\r\nfurnished, as he has himself recorded, with a “not very creditable\r\ncertificate.” This curiosity, after its kind, was to the effect that\r\nyouth at school may be compared to plants, which sometimes baffle all\r\nthe skill of the gardener, but, being transplanted to a different soil,\r\noccasionally turn out well. With this view, and no other, the bearer was\r\nsent to the University, which, possibly, might prove propitious to his\r\nprogress!\r\n\r\nHappily, the young man had a friend at the University, in his former\r\npreceptor—he of the mild and gentle disposition—who kept back the\r\ndoubtful recommendation, and procured his matriculation as one of his\r\nprivate pupils.\r\n\r\nAt Lund, Linnæus lodged in the house of Dr. Stobæus, professor of\r\nmedicine, and physician to the king. This eminent man, perceiving the\r\nindustry of his lodger, and his acquirements in natural science, allowed\r\nhim free access to his excellent museum of minerals, shells, and dried\r\nplants; and, highly delighted with the idea of a _hortus siccus_, Linnæus\r\nimmediately began to collect all the plants which grew in the vicinity,\r\nand to “glue them upon paper.” Still, he was denied the privilege of\r\naccess to the doctor’s library; but, as it fell out, he managed to\r\nobtain that also. He formed an acquaintance with a fellow-lodger, a\r\nyoung German student, who enjoyed the advantage he coveted, and, in\r\nreturn for teaching him the principles of physiology, he obtained of\r\nthis youth books from Stobæus’s library. He passed whole nights in\r\nreading the volumes thus clandestinely procured; but it happened that the\r\nmother of Stobæus, who was infirm and ailing, lay awake several nights\r\nin succession, and seeing a light constantly burning in Linnæus’s room,\r\nfearful of fire, desired her son to chide the young Smalander for his\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\nTwo nights after, at midnight, the lad was surprised by a visit from his\r\nhost, who found him, to his astonishment, diligently poring over his\r\nbooks. Being asked why he did not go to bed, and whence he had procured\r\nthe books, he was compelled to confess everything. Stobæus ordered him\r\nimmediately to go to bed; and the next morning, calling for him, gave him\r\npermission to make what use he pleased of his library. From that time\r\nthis excellent man admitted the youth to the utmost familiarity, received\r\nhim at his own table, and treated him even as a son.\r\n\r\nWhile botanizing in the country, in the following spring, Linnæus was\r\nbitten in the right arm by a venomous reptile, and so serious were the\r\nconsequences that his life was endangered. As soon as he was partially\r\nrecovered, he returned to his father’s house, in order to recruit his\r\nhealth during the summer vacation, and while staying in Smaland he was\r\npersuaded by his kind friend and benefactor, Dr. Rothmann, to quit Lund\r\nfor Upsala, as a superior school of medicine, and affording besides, many\r\nother advantages of which he could easily avail himself.\r\n\r\nIn this University—the first and most ancient seat of Swedish learning,\r\nand the scene, in after-years, of his greatness—our young student\r\nunderwent a severe process of training. Poor and unknown, he had no means\r\nof adding to the scanty pittance his parents were able to allow him.\r\nScarcely could they afford to give the small sum of 200 silver ducats\r\n(about £8) towards the expenses of his education there. In a short time\r\nhe found his pockets quite empty; and having no chance of obtaining\r\nprivate pupils, he vainly looked for any other source of maintenance. In\r\na few words, he thus touchingly records the tale of his suffering, and\r\nthe first beam of hope that shone across his path. As Petronius says,\r\npoverty is the attendant of a good mind; and Linnæus was not without it\r\nin this university, ... he was obliged to trust to chance for a meal, and\r\nin the article of dress was reduced to such shifts that he was obliged,\r\nwhen his shoes required mending, to patch them with folded paper instead\r\nof sending them to the cobbler.\r\n\r\nYears afterwards, the most distinguished zoologist France ever produced,\r\nM. de Lamarck, stated to a friend, “I was poor, indeed, but I had not,\r\nlike Linnæus, to gather up my fellow-students’ old shoes to wear.”\r\n\r\nHe repented of his journey to Upsala, and of his departure from the\r\nroof of Stobæus; but to return to Lund was a tiresome and expensive\r\nundertaking. Stobæus, too, had taken it very ill, that a pupil whom he\r\nloved so sincerely had left that University without consulting him.\r\n\r\nAt this time Linnæus, in spite of his great industry and simple manner of\r\nliving, naturally had considerable anxieties about his success in life.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day, in the autumn of the year 1728, whilst Linnæus was\r\nvery intently examining some plants in the academical garden, there\r\nentered a venerable old clergyman, who asked him what he was about,\r\nwhether he was acquainted with plants, whence he came, and how long he\r\nhad been prosecuting his studies? To all these questions he returned\r\nsatisfactory answers, and was then invited to accompany his interrogator\r\nto his house, which proved to be that of Dr. Olaus Celsius.\r\n\r\nThis estimable and learned man, to whom Scandinavia owes so much in\r\nregard to natural history, had just returned from Stockholm, where he had\r\nbeen engaged in preparing his celebrated work upon the plants mentioned\r\nin the Holy Scriptures, which he published in 1745, having travelled to\r\nthe East on purpose to make it more complete. Little did Celsius imagine\r\nthat the youth, whom he first met, by chance, in the academical garden\r\nat Upsala, was destined, in after years, by his genius, to immortalize\r\nits fame. He, however, soon discerned the merits of Linnæus, took him\r\nunder his protection, offering him board and lodging in his own house,\r\nand allowing him the full use of his library, which was very rich in\r\nbotanical books. Among all his patrons, Linnæus appears to have dearly\r\ncherished the memory of this venerable man, never referring to him but in\r\nterms of reverence and gratitude. The friendship and patronage of one so\r\ndistinguished, did not fail to procure for the youth the advantages he so\r\nmuch needed. Before long, the son of Professor Rudbeck, and other young\r\nmen, became his private pupils, and by this means his pecuniary wants\r\nwere supplied.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, seems to have given Linnæus so much satisfaction in\r\nreviewing the events of this period of his early history, as the intimate\r\nfriendship he now contracted with a fellow-student, named Artedi,\r\nwho afterwards distinguished himself by his knowledge of fishes and\r\numbelliferous plants. To the picture he has drawn of his friend, Linnæus\r\nhas added a slight sketch of himself. There was a great difference in the\r\npersonal appearance, as well as in the temperament and disposition of\r\nthe two youths. Artedi was of a tall and handsome figure, more serious,\r\nand of a deliberate judgment; whereas his friend was short in stature\r\nand stout, hasty in temper, and of a sanguine turn. The two companions\r\npursued their favourite studies with an honourable spirit of emulation.\r\nThey divided the kingdoms and provinces of nature between them, and while\r\nLinnæus yielded the palm to Artedi in ichthyology (the science of fish),\r\nthe latter acknowledged Linnæus to be his superior in entomology, or that\r\nof insects. Each kept his discoveries to himself, though for no great\r\nlength of time, since not a day passed without one surprising the other\r\nby narrating some new fact, so that emulation produced mutual industry of\r\nresearch, and stimulated each to new exertions.\r\n\r\nLinnæus was now in his twenty-second year, about which time he met with\r\na review of Le Vaillant’s treatise, “Sur la Structure des Fleurs” (“On\r\nthe Structure of Flowers”), by which his curiosity was excited to a close\r\nexamination of the stamens and pistils (the central and reproductive\r\nstructures), and, perceiving the essential importance of these parts of\r\nthe plant, he formed the design of a new method of arrangement, founded\r\nupon these organs. This was the first dawning idea of that great system\r\nupon which his subsequent fame was based.\r\n\r\nA flower of a complete kind consists of the parts of the plant which\r\nreproduce or form the seed, enclosed within two particular envelopes. The\r\nenvelopes of the flower are the beautifully coloured parts called petals,\r\nwhich form the corolla, or inner envelope, and the duller-coloured or\r\ngreen sepals outside the corolla, and which form the calyx.\r\n\r\nProtected by these coverings, are the central parts or organs. Quite\r\nin the middle of the flower is the ovary, made up of one or several\r\nportions—the pistils, which contain the future seeds or ovules. The top\r\nof the whole, which projects in the middle of the flower, is the stigma,\r\nand the prolonged part beneath it is the style, and this surmounts the\r\nseed-case or ovary. Outside this central part, and between it and the\r\ncorolla, are the stamens, each of which—for their number varies—may\r\nconsist of a stalk or filament, bearing an anther, which is coloured, and\r\ncontains the pollen, or dust, which fertilizes the ovule, by falling on\r\nto the stigma.\r\n\r\nThese central parts are the reproductive organs, and are those which,\r\nabove all others, are the most important, for without them a plant cannot\r\nincrease and multiply, and would become extinct. The floral envelopes,\r\nbeautiful as they are, are not so essential, and are of secondary\r\nimportance in classification. Now, in some kinds of plants the stigma\r\nand the ovary exist in one individual and the stamens in another. The\r\nplant which bears the ovary is called the female, and that which has\r\nthe pollen-making part is termed the male. Hence it is said that plants\r\nhave sexes. But in a vast number of plants these organs are combined\r\nin the same individual. Linnæus considered the stamen to be of primary\r\nimportance, and established eleven classes of plants distinguished by\r\nthe numbers of the stamens, and these all relate to plants in which the\r\nmale and female organs are combined in the same individual. Thus the red\r\nvalerian has one stamen only, and it was classed in _monandria_, the\r\nfirst part of the word meaning “one” and the last “male.” The lilac has\r\ntwo stamens, and was classed in the _diandria_—“two male;” and other\r\nplants were classified up to those which have ten stamens, the pink,\r\nfor instance, as _decandria_. An eleventh class included all plants\r\nwhich bear flowers containing from twelve to nineteen stamens, such as\r\nmignonette. Then two more classes were invented to comprise—1, plants\r\nwith twenty or more stamens placed on the calyx, as the cherry; 2, others\r\nwith twenty or more stamens which are placed on stalks rising from below\r\nthe ovary, as in the buttercup. Other classes were formed according to\r\nthe relative length of the stamens, as in the foxglove and wallflower,\r\nand also from the grouping of the stamens in bundles. Then there were\r\nthree very important classes in which the sexes are in separate flowers.\r\nFinally, the flowerless plants, such as the ferns, lichens, and fungi,\r\nwere united as cryptogamia, having their organs of reproduction more or\r\nless concealed.\r\n\r\nThe next part of the classification refers to orders which are\r\nsubdivisions of classes. The orders of the first thirteen classes,\r\nmentioned above, are founded on the number of styles (or of stigmas if\r\nthese are absent), and the names given, relate to the number and the term\r\ngynia, or female.\r\n\r\nThus the order monogynia includes plants of all the thirteen classes that\r\nhave only one style to each flower, such as the primrose; and so on,\r\nuntil polygynia, or “many female”—plants of such an order, having more\r\nthan twelve styles, like the rose and clematis.\r\n\r\nOne class has a very important division into two orders, one of which\r\nhas naked and the other covered seeds; another has orders from the\r\nshape of the fruit or pod. Linnæus divided the cryptogamia into six\r\norders—the ferns, mosses, liverworts, lichens, fungi, and seaweeds. There\r\nis no doubt that this classification enables the name of a plant to be\r\ndiscovered, if it has been properly described and named, very easily,\r\nand it added to the facilities of classificatory botany. But it did not\r\nbring plants having many other and very important characters together,\r\nand it separated many which are closely allied by similar structures.\r\nIt was and is called the artificial system. It was not a natural\r\nclassification like that foreshadowed by Ray. The careful distinction\r\nof the sexes of plants was, of course, the foundation of the system, and\r\nto that Linnæus paid great attention. Writing a little treatise on the\r\nsubject, he showed it to Celsius, who communicated it to Dr. Rudbeck.\r\nThis man, free from the usual jealousy of the age, took Linnæus as his\r\nassistant, and asked him to lecture in the botanical garden. Thus the\r\nyoung man became a teacher in the very place where he had applied the\r\nyear before for the humble situation of gardener. Dr. Rudbeck, moreover,\r\ntook him into his house as tutor to his children, and thus he had access\r\nto a fine collection of books and drawings on natural history subjects.\r\nHis mornings were then occupied in giving instruction to the students,\r\nand his evenings in composing the new system and meditating a general\r\nreformation in botanical science. He had no time to waste at Upsala.\r\nIt will have been noticed how kindly Linnæus was treated by a few true\r\nlovers of science, and it was greatly to the honour of the good simple\r\npeople of science-loving Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nPeople imagine that the progress and prosperity of scientific men depend\r\nupon themselves alone; but many a promising career has been arrested by\r\npetty jealousy and the expression of ill will on the part of those who\r\nare second-rate men of science. On the other hand, truly distinguished\r\nscientific men are mostly only too glad to assist earnest, hard-working,\r\nand meritorious students. Linnæus found that he was no exception to the\r\nrule that appears to determine that a prosperous poor man shall have\r\nenemies. He was opposed by a Dr. Rosen on his return from foreign travel,\r\nbut Linnæus stood his ground. But when his father suggested a voyage into\r\nLapland to collect plants, Linnæus gladly seized the opportunity, and\r\nafter arrangements had been made, he went to stay awhile at home.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1732 Linnæus left his father’s house, to set out on his arduous\r\nundertaking. On his way to Upsala he paid a visit to his former friend\r\nand preceptor, Stobæus, at Lund, and studied his collection of minerals,\r\nthe only branch of natural history with which (he tells us) he was\r\nunacquainted. He shortly after proceeded to Upsala, from which place he\r\nset out on his journey alone, May 12th, 1732, “being at that time within\r\nhalf a day of twenty-five years of age.”\r\n\r\nDuring this journey Linnæus travelled over the greater part of Lapland,\r\nskirting the boundaries of Norway, and returned to Upsala by the eastern\r\nside of the Bothnian Gulf, having performed a journey of near four\r\nthousand English miles, mostly on foot, in five months. He necessarily\r\nendured many hardships and vast fatigue, and his life was several times\r\nimperilled. Bogs and forests intercepted his way, and food, even of the\r\ncoarsest description, was occasionally not easily procured; yet, amid all\r\ndifficulties, his spirit was unflagging, and obstacles only seemed to\r\nquicken his zeal. The natural curiosities of the country, the manners of\r\nthe people, and the general features of the various regions he traversed,\r\nall were observed and written down for future use. He collected above a\r\nhundred plants, entirely undescribed and unknown before, and upon his\r\nreturn arranged all the flora of Lapland according to his own favourite\r\nsystem, and delivered an account of his journey publicly.\r\n\r\nThe result of his botanical observations was not published for several\r\nyears afterwards, during his residence in Holland. This expedition was\r\nthe first and most difficult of all the six journeys of Linnæus. He spoke\r\nof it afterwards in one of his academical addresses in these words: “My\r\njourney through Lapland was particularly toilsome, and I own that I was\r\nobliged to sustain more hardships and dangers in that sole peregrination\r\nthrough the frontier of our northern world, than in all the other\r\ntravels I undertook in other parts. But having once sustained the toils\r\nof travelling, I buried in the oblivion of Lethe all the dangers and\r\ndifficulties I endured, the invaluable fruits I reaped having compensated\r\nfor every toil.” Writing to a friend on the same subject, he says: “All\r\nmy food in these fatiguing excursions consisted, for the most part, of\r\nfish and reindeer’s milk. Bread, salt, and what is found everywhere\r\nelse, did but seldom recreate my palate. One of the greatest nuisances\r\nwhich I met with in Lapland was the immense number of flies. I used to\r\nkeep them off, by drawing a crape over my face.” The youthful traveller\r\nstarted on his adventurous journey “without encumbrances of any kind,\r\nand carried all his baggage on his back,” by which means alone he was\r\nenabled to prosecute the objects he had in view. Leaving Upsala by the\r\nnorthern gate, he travelled for a considerable distance through fertile\r\ncorn-fields, bounded by hills, and the view terminated by extensive\r\nforests. With respect to situation and variety of prospects, the young\r\nSwede was of opinion that scarcely any city could stand a comparison\r\nwith this. At a short distance from the gates he left, on the right,\r\nOld Upsala, the place renowned for the worship of the primeval gods of\r\nSweden, and for the inauguration and residence of her earliest king.\r\nHere, in days of high antiquity, human sacrifices were offered at the\r\nshrines of the pagan deities, and here our traveller noticed the three\r\nlarge sepulchral mounds which tradition has assigned to the bodies of\r\nOdin, Frigga, and Thor.\r\n\r\n“Cheered with the song of the charming lark,” which attended his steps\r\nthrough the lowland, his approach to the forest was welcomed by the\r\nredwing, “whose amorous warblings from the tops of the spruce firs”\r\nappeared to him to rival the nightingale itself. As the summer was\r\nadvancing, he thought it not desirable to lose time by the way, nor\r\nto stray far from the high road in the early part of the tour; but\r\nattentively observing what presented itself to him as he passed along, he\r\nnoted the various plants, animals, and insects, together with the general\r\nfeatures of the country.\r\n\r\nArrived in the province of Medelpad, he ascended its highest mountain,\r\nleaving his horse “tied to an ancient Runic monumental stone.” He found\r\nseveral uncommon plants here; and from the summit, gazed on the country\r\nspread out below, varied with plains and cultivated fields, villages,\r\nlakes, and rivers—a most picturesque and romantic region. The descent was\r\nvery difficult, and even dangerous. Leaving this mountain, he took his\r\nroute along the sea-shore, which was spread with the wrecks of vessels,\r\ntelling to the feeling heart of the young traveller a sad tale of woe.\r\n“How many prayers, sighs, tears, vows, and lamentations—all, alas! in\r\nvain—rose to my imagination at this melancholy spectacle!” he exclaims.\r\nThe sight reminded him of a student who, going by sea from Stockholm to\r\nAbo, experienced so severely the terrors of the ocean, that he chose to\r\nwalk back round the head of the Bothnian Gulf, rather than adventure\r\nhimself again upon the deep. This youth, afterwards a Professor at Abo,\r\nassumed the surname of Tillands, expressive of his attachment to _terra\r\nfirma_, and Linnæus named in honour of him, a plant which cannot bear wet.\r\n\r\nIn five or six days, Linnæus reached Hernosand, the principal town of\r\nAngermania, on the Bothnian Gulf, and visited a tremendously steep and\r\nlofty mountain called Skula, where was a cavern, which he desired to\r\nexplore. Here he was within a hair’s breadth of a fatal accident, for\r\none of the peasants who accompanied him, in climbing up, loosened a\r\nlarge stone, which was hurled down the track Linnæus had just left,\r\nand fell exactly on the spot he had occupied. “If I had not (he says)\r\nprovidentially changed my route, nobody would ever have heard of me more;\r\nI was surrounded by fire and smoke, and should certainly, but for the\r\nprotecting hand of Providence, have been crushed to pieces.” From this\r\npoint of the journey a change came over the face of nature. The country\r\nwas covered over with snow, in some places inches deep; the pretty spring\r\nflowers disappeared, and in their place nothing but wintry plants were\r\nseen peeping through the snow. At length, on the 23rd of May, he reached\r\nUmœa, in West Bothnia, where he turned out of the main road to the\r\nleft, designing to visit Lycksele, Lapmark; by which means he lost the\r\nadvantage of the regular post horses, and found the ways so narrow and\r\nintricate, that at every step he stumbled. “In this dreary wilderness\r\nI began to feel very solitary, and to long earnestly for a companion\r\n(he says); the few inhabitants I met had a foreign accent, and always\r\nconcluded their sentences with an adjective.”\r\n\r\nAs the night shut in, the way-worn traveller began also to long for\r\na good meal, and has thus recorded the result of his application, on\r\narriving at a village where he passed the night:—“On my inquiring what\r\nI could have for supper, they set before me the breast of a cock of the\r\nwoods, which had been shot and dressed some time the preceding year. Its\r\naspect was not very inviting; but the taste proved delicious, and I\r\nfound, with pleasure, that these poor Laplanders know better than some of\r\ntheir more opulent neighbours, how to employ the good things which God\r\nhas bestowed upon them.”\r\n\r\nThe bird is prepared by a process of salting and drying, and will keep\r\neven for three years, if necessary. Linnæus next proceeded up the river\r\nof Umœa as far as Lycksele, where he was hospitably received by the\r\nworthy pastor of the place; and the next day, being Whit-Sunday, he\r\nstayed there, and would fain have remained longer; but, for fear of the\r\nfloods impeding his journey, he hastened his departure on the morrow,\r\nand on the 1st of June entered the territories of the native Laplanders,\r\npassing through wild forests, with no traces of roads. A more desolate\r\npicture of wretchedness than this region presented, could hardly be\r\nimagined. It was flooded by the rivers, and the bogs were utterly\r\nimpassable. At every step the water was above the knees, and the feet\r\nfelt the ice at the bottom. “We pursued our journey (continues the diary)\r\nwith considerable labour and difficulty all night long, if that might be\r\ncalled night which was as light as the day, the sun disappearing for half\r\nan hour only, and the temperature of the air being rather cold.” The poor\r\ninhabitants had themselves, at this season, nothing to eat but a scanty\r\nsupply of fish; for they had not begun to kill their reindeer, nor to\r\nmilk them. In addition to these evils, the villainous bites of the gnats\r\nand other insects tortured the unhappy travellers, till at length he\r\nexclaims—“I had now my fill of travelling!”\r\n\r\nGladly would he have returned by the way he came, but he could find no\r\nroad back; and even the hardy Laplanders themselves, “born to labour,\r\nas the birds to fly,” could not help complaining, and declared they had\r\nnever been in such extremity before. It is evident that even the robust\r\nframe of Linnæus was beginning to yield to the combined effects of\r\nfatigue, exhaustion, and hunger. He at length obtained some food which he\r\nwas able to eat, and after incredible exertions succeeded in retracing\r\nhis steps to the river, on which he again embarked, and returned to Umœa;\r\nhaving, as he ingenuously acknowledged, “with the thoughtlessness of\r\nyouth, undertaken more than he was able to perform.”\r\n\r\nFrom Umœa, Linnæus proceeded to Pithœa, which he reached after two\r\ndays’ journey, “the night being as pleasant for travelling as the day.”\r\nHe notices the beauty of the fresh shoots of the spruce fir, which\r\nconstitute one of the greatest ornaments of the forests which adorn this\r\npart of Sweden.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious to proceed with all haste, in order if possible to reach\r\nthe Alps of Lulean Lapland, “in time to see the sun above the horizon\r\nat midnight, which is beheld then to the best advantage,” the traveller\r\nmade no longer stay at Lulea than was needful for the purposes of\r\nexploring the neighbouring coast and islands. He has noted the various\r\nentomological and other specimens he observed, and, after admiring the\r\nbeauty of some of them, exclaims, in a sort of rapture—“The observer of\r\nnature sees with admiration that the whole world is full of the glory of\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\nDuring this voyage, Swanberg, who has taken great delight in Linnæus’s\r\nconversation, offered to instruct him in the art of assaying within a\r\nvery short time, if he would agree to visit Calix, on his way homeward.\r\nAt Quickjock, the wife of the curate provided our traveller with stores\r\nsufficient for eight days, and procured him a Laplander, whose assistance\r\nas interpreter and servant was highly necessary.\r\n\r\n“On my first ascending these wild Alps (he says), I felt as if in a new\r\nworld. Here were no forests to be seen, but mountains upon mountains,\r\nlarger and larger, as I advanced, all covered with snow; no road, no\r\ntracks, nor any sign of inhabitants were visible. The declining sun never\r\ndisappeared sufficiently to allow any cooling shade, and by climbing\r\nto the more elevated parts of these lofty mountains, I could see it at\r\nmidnight, above the horizon. This spectacle I considered as not one of\r\nthe least of nature’s miracles, for what inhabitant of other countries\r\nwould not wish to behold it? O Lord, how wonderful are thy works!”\r\n\r\nIn this frozen region there were no traces of verdure, save in the deep\r\nvalleys between the mountains. Very few birds were visible, except\r\nsome ptarmigans, those hardy inhabitants of the bleak mountain tops. A\r\npretty little incident, recorded by Linnæus, shows so kind a heart that\r\nit must not be omitted here. “The little Alpine variety of the ptarmigan\r\nwas now accompanied by its young. I caught one of these, upon which the\r\nhen ran so close to me that I could easily have taken her also. She\r\nkept continually jumping round and round me, but I thought it a pity to\r\ndeprive the tender brood of their mother; neither would my compassion for\r\nthe mother allow me long to detain her offspring, which I returned to her\r\nin safety.”\r\n\r\nAfter a long and wearisome journey along these mountain passes,\r\nthe traveller reached one of the cottages of the country. Here the\r\ninhabitants, sixteen in number, received him kindly, and gave him two\r\nreindeer skins to sleep between. In the morning some hundreds of reindeer\r\ncame home to be milked, and it amazed the stranger to perceive that,\r\nalthough to his eyes they were all perfectly alike, yet each of the herd\r\nhad its appropriate name, and was readily distinguished by the owners.\r\n\r\nSteering his course south-west, Linnæus proceeded to the lofty ice\r\nmountains, or “main ridge of the country,” which he had no sooner\r\nreached, than a storm overtook him, accompanied by a shower of thin\r\npieces of ice, which soon encrusted his garments. The cold was intense,\r\nand the whole country was one dazzling waste. No sooner, however, had\r\nhe crossed the summit of the ridge than a change was perceptible, and\r\nsoon, from the lofty heights, he beheld the ample forests of Norway lying\r\nfar beneath. The whole appearance of the country was perfectly green,\r\nand, notwithstanding its vast extent, looked like a garden in miniature.\r\nThe descent was slow and long protracted, but at length he reached the\r\nplains, of which he had enjoyed so glorious a prospect. “Nothing (he\r\nexclaims) could be more delightful to my feelings than this transition\r\nfrom all the severity of winter, to the warmth and beauty of summer. Oh!\r\nhow most lovely of all is summer! The verdant herbage, the sweet-scented\r\nclover, the tall grass reaching up to my arms, the grateful flavour of\r\nthe wild fruits, and the fine weather that welcomed me at the foot of\r\nthese Alps, seemed to refresh me both in mind and body.”\r\n\r\nHere Linnæus found himself close to the sea-coast, and he went to sea in\r\na boat to search for the natural productions of that element. He would\r\nfain have approached the celebrated whirlpool, called the Maelstrom, but\r\nhe found no one willing to venture it. On the 13th of July, he arrived\r\nat the parsonage house of Rorstadt, from the occupant of which, himself\r\na traveller and a naturalist, Linnæus received a cordial welcome. A\r\nrather significant entry in Linnæus’ diary tells us that here, “in this\r\nfar distant nook of the wide peopled earth,” the young enthusiast found\r\nan object of surpassing interest. “The pastor (he says) has a handsome\r\ndaughter, named Sarah Rask, eighteen years of age; she seemed to me\r\nuncommonly beautiful.” The next morning, Linnæus took his leave of this\r\nelysium, and proceeded on his way. Climbing the mountains again, he found\r\na work of “no small fatigue and exhaustion,” and he has given us a most\r\npainful account of the subsequent route he pursued towards the Alps of\r\nTornea. “What I endured,” he concludes, “is hardly to be described; how\r\nmany weary steps I had to set, the precipices that came in my way, and\r\nmy excessive fatigue. Water was our only drink during the journey, and\r\nit never appeared so refreshing as when we sucked it out of the melting\r\nsnow.” At length, tired of advancing further into this inhospitable\r\ncountry, he determined to return to Quickjock. In the course of his\r\njourney thither his life was twice endangered, but at length he reached\r\nthe place of his destination, “having been four weeks without tasting\r\nbread.” After resting some days at Quickjock, Linnæus descended the\r\nriver again to Lulea, where he “learned the art of assaying from the\r\nmine-master, Swanberg, at Calix, in two days and a night,” and thence\r\nhis journey was continued through Tornea. He had intended to visit the\r\nmountains, but before he could get thither the winter set in, and he was\r\nobliged to return along the coast on the eastern side of the Bothnian\r\nGulf. The last entry in his journal is dated October 10th, and is as\r\nfollows: “About one o’clock, P.M., I arrived safe at Upsala. To the Maker\r\nand Preserver of all things be praise, honour, and glory for ever!”\r\n\r\nAt first, indeed, he seemed to reap but a humble reward for his toils. On\r\nhis arrival at home, he presented to the Academy of Sciences an account\r\nof his expedition, which obtained their approbation, and they gave him\r\n112 silver dollars (not more than £10)—his travelling expenses. In the\r\nfollowing spring, he began a private course of lectures on the art of\r\nassaying (which he had learned so cleverly from his chance companion\r\nduring the Lapland journey). This art had never been taught at Upsala\r\nbefore; and the novelty of the subject, the skilful manner in which he\r\ncommunicated instructions, and the reasonable terms he exacted, secured\r\nLinnæus a considerable number of pupils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF LINNÆUS (_Continued_).\r\n\r\n    The publication and reception of the artificial system of\r\n    classifying plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nLinnæus had many difficulties to contend with, however. He found his old\r\nrival, Rosen, at work; and Linnæus accuses this man of the meanness of\r\nobtaining, partly by entreaty, partly by threats, his manuscript lectures\r\non botany, which he valued more than anything he possessed, and which\r\nhe afterwards detected his rival in copying. This formidable enemy next\r\nproceeded to prevent Linnæus from obtaining the means of subsistence.\r\nThere was no room for the young botanist at Upsala, and, indeed, botany\r\nappeared to be a bad profession. So he turned again to mineralogy, and\r\ngot up a students’ expedition to Fahlun and Dalecarlia. He settled down\r\nat Fahlun for a while as a teacher, and found himself as it were in a\r\nnew world, where everybody loved and assisted him. He earned money by\r\nhis medical knowledge. The Bishop of Abo asked Linnæus to give him\r\nsome instruction in botany and mineralogy, and became much attached\r\nto the young man. The bishop advised Linnæus to go abroad and get his\r\ndoctor’s degree, and also to marry. The last was as difficult as the\r\nfirst, but being more to his taste at the time, he wooed the daughter\r\nof Dr. John Morœa, a man of considerable property. The young student\r\nmade his proposals with considerable trepidation, and had he not been\r\nsatisfied that the lady was willing, he would have let the matter alone.\r\nThe worthy doctor thought well of Linnæus, but not of his prospects in\r\nlife, but he decided that after a lapse of three years he would give his\r\nreply. Thus, at the age of twenty-nine, Linnæus found himself with a\r\nbetrothed, no occupation, and a great deal of knowledge and perseverance.\r\nHe had to live, and so he determined to stick to physic, and to get a\r\ndoctor’s degree. He contrived to scrape together £15, and went on his\r\nway to the University of Harderwyk. First, like a good son, he went to\r\nsee his father, and to console him on the loss of the mother—a loss\r\ngreatly felt by the young man at this critical period of his life. Then\r\nLinnæus journeyed to the south, and arrived at Hamburg, where his whole\r\ntime was employed in viewing the fine garden, and everything else worthy\r\nof attention. The public library he examined, and also the principal\r\ncabinets of natural history, and he read there for the first time the\r\nbotanical works of Ray, whom he esteemed as one of the most penetrating\r\nobservers of the natural affinity of plants. Amsterdam was the next\r\nplace, and then Harderwyk, where, after being examined, and publishing\r\na paper on the cure of intermittent fever, he was dubbed M.D. He left\r\nfor Leyden, and met Dr. Gronovius, to whom he showed his classification.\r\nGronovius was so delighted with it that he had it published at his own\r\nexpense in eight large sheets. He called on the celebrated Boerhaave, and\r\nafter eight days’ waiting obtained an audience. Boerhaave took a liking\r\nto the young man, and recommended him to Dr. Burmann, of Amsterdam, in\r\nwhose house he remained for many months. During that time Linnæus printed\r\nhis “Fundamenta Botanica,” of which a great writer has said, “it contains\r\nthe very essence of botanical philosophy, and has never been superseded\r\nnor refuted.” He commended his book to his friend Artedi, who had just\r\nfinished a work on Fishes. Death put an end to this friendship with\r\nArtedi, who was accidentally drowned.\r\n\r\nThis stay at Amsterdam determined the future career of Linnæus, for he\r\nwas introduced there to an English banker, Mr. Clifford, whose garden\r\nat Hartecoup was one of the finest in the world. Linnæus removed to Mr.\r\nClifford’s house, where he said he lived like a prince, had one of the\r\nfinest gardens in the world under his inspection, permission to procure\r\nall the plants that were wanted in the garden and such books as were not\r\nto be found in the library, and of course enjoyed all the advantages he\r\ncould wish for, in his botanical studies, to which he devoted himself day\r\nand night. He got his description of the plants of Lapland printed, and\r\neverybody recognized the charms of the descriptions in the book.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736, Linnæus paid a visit to England. He did so by the\r\nrequest, and at the expense, of Mr. Clifford, who was desirous to procure\r\nvarious plants for his collection, and that he should communicate\r\nwith the most celebrated botanists and horticulturists of the day. He\r\ncarried with him a letter from Boerhaave to Sir Hans Sloane, who was\r\na mere rich collector in natural history, and afterwards founder of\r\nthe British Museum. This letter is still preserved among the archives\r\nof that institution, and it is written in the strongest language of\r\nrecommendation. Notwithstanding such an honourable introduction, however,\r\nthe old baronet, who was a sort of highly cultivated curiosity-shop\r\nkeeper and not a scientific man, was indisposed to do justice to the\r\nmerits of a young man whose innovations on established systems he\r\nviewed with suspicion and dislike. He therefore treated the stranger\r\nwith coldness, and dismissed him without any marks of regard. One of\r\nthe principal objects of interest to Linnæus, in this country, was the\r\nbotanical garden at Chelsea; and from the keeper of that collection,\r\nPhilip Miller, an excellent botanist, he experienced much attention,\r\nand was supplied with many rare plants. The garden at Chelsea was the\r\nfirst in Great Britain that was subsequently arranged according to the\r\nLinnæan system. Dr. Shaw, the Oriental traveller, Professor Martyn,\r\nPeter Collinson, and many other men of true science, received Linnæus\r\nconsistently with his testimonials, and admiring his genius, forwarded\r\nhis objects by all the means in their power, and, on his return to\r\nthe Continent, continued to correspond with him on subjects of mutual\r\ninterest in science.\r\n\r\nFrom London our traveller proceeded to Oxford, where he paid his respects\r\nto the celebrated Dillenius, justly considered one of the first botanists\r\nof the time. This learned man was not by any means disposed to regard\r\nLinnæus favourably. He had received from Gronovius a sheet of the “Genera\r\nPlantarum,” and conceiving it to be written in opposition to him, was\r\nirate, and, pointing to the young Swede, said to a gentleman who chanced\r\nto be in his company at the moment of Linnæus’s entry, “See, this is the\r\nyoung man who confounds all botany!” Linnæus did not understand English,\r\nbut the word “confound,” so similar to the Latin _confundere_, let him\r\ninto the secret of the professor’s words. He, however, showed no sign of\r\ncomprehending him.\r\n\r\nLinnæus almost despaired of gaining the friendship of this learned man,\r\nand obtaining from him the plants he wanted. At length, on the third\r\nday of his visit to Oxford, he went to take leave of Dillenius, and, in\r\nparting, said, “I have but one request to make of you; will you tell me\r\nwhy you called me, the other day, the person who confounds all botany?”\r\nUnable to evade so direct a question, Dillenius took him to his library,\r\nand showed him the sheet of his genera which he had obtained. It was\r\nmarked in sundry places with notes of query. “What signify these marks?”\r\nsaid Linnæus. “They signify all the false genera of plants in your book,”\r\nanswered the other. This challenge led to an explanation, in which\r\nLinnæus proved his accuracy in every instance. The result was an entire\r\nchange on the part of Dillenius, who afterwards detained Linnæus with him\r\na month, and found so much satisfaction in his company that he kept him\r\nalways in close converse, scarce leaving him an hour to himself. At last\r\nhe parted from him with tears in his eyes, after making him the offer to\r\nstay and share his salary, which would have sufficed for them both.\r\n\r\nLinnæus never learned any language, not even Dutch, although he lived\r\nthree years in Holland. “Nevertheless,” he says, “I found my way\r\neverywhere well and happily.” Despite this great obstacle, Linnæus\r\nappears to have counted among his friends and correspondents some of\r\nthe fair sex, in several countries. Lady Ann Monson in London, and\r\nMrs. Blackburne at Oxford, were among this number; and he had a most\r\nenthusiastic admirer in Miss Jane Colden, of America, who was introduced\r\nto his notice by one of his correspondents, as the only lady known to be\r\nscientifically acquainted with the Linnæan system. She had drawn and\r\ndescribed four hundred plants, according to his method, using English\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nPleased with the favour and interest thus manifested, Linnæus\r\nacknowledged his sense of them, by preserving the names of these ladies\r\nin the vegetable kingdom, and, among others, he named two genera of\r\nbeautiful plants, Monsonia and Coldenia. The study of botany was so\r\ngreatly promoted and facilitated by the easy and pleasant method\r\nintroduced by Linnæus, that it is no wonder the ladies acknowledged,\r\nwith gratitude, their obligation to the naturalist who first originated\r\na method by which this delightful study could be brought within the\r\nattainment of all who loved it.\r\n\r\nLinnæus wished to visit Paris, and travelled by way of Leyden, where he\r\nenjoyed the society of Lieberkühn, a professor possessed of “incomparable\r\nmicroscopes.” He stopped there until the spring of 1738, and not long\r\nbefore his departure, he had an affecting interview with the great\r\nBoerhaave, then on his death-bed. This illustrious man, who had proved\r\nhimself so generous a friend to the young naturalist, took a sorrowful\r\nand affectionate leave of him. His parting words were: “I have lived out\r\nmy time, and done what I could; may God preserve thee, from whom the\r\nworld expects much more. Farewell, dear Linnæus!” Linnæus fell ill, and\r\nwas attended by his fellow-labourer, Von Swieten, and on his recovery Mr.\r\nClifford sent him for a tour into Brabant. Thence he went to Paris, saw\r\nthe Jussieus and Réaumur, and was admitted a corresponding member of the\r\nAcademy of Science. Leaving Paris, he went northwards to see his father,\r\nand then to his love. The course of true love had run very crookedly, for\r\na mutual friend, who had been the medium of the correspondence of the\r\nlovers, fell in love with the lady himself. She was true, however, and\r\nthey were finally betrothed. It was strange that the greatest botanist\r\nof the day could not get a living out of his science, and it is not to\r\nthe credit of his native country. Again Linnæus had to take to physic,\r\nand settling at Stockholm, found that the people would not trust him with\r\nthe cure of their dogs, much less with that of themselves. Abroad he had\r\nbeen honoured everywhere, and in his own country he was a nobody. All of\r\na sudden things changed, he cured somebody, and everybody went to him to\r\nbe cured. Then his star began to shine, the people of Upsala began to\r\nremember him. Count Tessin, who had been tutor to the King of Sweden, and\r\nwho was a lover of natural history, procured him a salary of two hundred\r\nducats a year, on condition that he would give public lectures on botany\r\nand mineralogy. Linnæus wrote of this good friend: “He received me, a\r\nstranger, on my return; he obtained me a salary from the States, the\r\nappointment of physician to the Admiralty, the professorship of Botany\r\nat Upsala, the title of Dean of the College of Physicians, the favour of\r\ntwo kings, and recommended me by a medal, to posterity.” Having a good\r\nincome at last, Linnæus entreated that his marriage might not longer\r\nbe delayed. He married Sara Elizabeth Morœa, at her father’s home near\r\nFahlun.\r\n\r\nOne of Linnæus’s biographers says, “He was fonder, on the whole, of\r\nmeddling with plants than with patients;” and in the true spirit of\r\nscience, Linnæus gave up his lucrative practice to settle down as\r\nProfessor of Botany to the University of Upsala. It was the summit of his\r\nwishes, and in 1741 he began to reside at Upsala, which was to be his\r\nfuture home.\r\n\r\nHis zeal, talents, and widespread renown soon produced the desired\r\neffect, and in a few years the garden at Upsala ranked equal, if not\r\nsuperior, to similar institutions in Europe. Contributions to its\r\nstores continually poured in from all quarters, and the most celebrated\r\nbotanists vied with each other in presenting the treasures of every\r\nregion and climate of the globe to its distinguished superintendent.\r\nSix years after the establishment of this garden, the new professor\r\npublished its description. The numbers of the foreign species of plants\r\nin it at that time, amounted to one thousand one hundred. He was filled\r\nwith delight when he beheld these fruits of his labours. As a teacher and\r\nlecturer, Linnæus distinguished himself in a particular manner. His old\r\nstudents always spoke well of his teaching, and he trained some of the\r\nmost distinguished botanists in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe names of Kalm, Thunberg, Sparrman, Solander, and Fabricius, for\r\ninstance, are well known in the scientific world; and there is perhaps\r\nnothing more truly honourable to the memory of their great master,\r\nthan the fact that he was the founder of such a school of able and\r\nenterprising men.\r\n\r\nLinnæus impressed upon his students, and took care to remember in his\r\nown writings, that it was absolutely necessary to be exact in botanical\r\ndescriptions—that the genus should be properly named, and that it should\r\nrepresent an idea into which certain species could enter.\r\n\r\nTo the poor, and even to the rich, foreign students who resided at Upsala\r\nentirely on his account, he was most generous, refusing the perquisites\r\nwhich he should have received for his lectures. To the former he remitted\r\nthe money from purely benevolent motives, while he declined it from\r\nthe others, that he might convince them how truly proud he was of his\r\nscience, so that he would fain make it free of cost to those who sought\r\nafter it. One of them having repeatedly urged Linnæus to accept a Swedish\r\nbank-note as an acknowledgment for the pains he had taken to teach him,\r\nhe said, “Tell me candidly, are you rich, and can you afford it? Can you\r\nwell spare this money on your return to Germany? If you can, then give\r\nthe note to my wife; but, if you be poor, so help me Heaven, I will take\r\nnot a single farthing from you.” “You are the only Swiss that visits\r\nme, and I feel a pleasure in telling you all I know, gratis,” was his\r\nanswer to another, who importuned him in the same manner. It was evident\r\nthat he was never so much at home, so entirely happy, as in his garden,\r\nand while searching into the secrets and hidden properties and workings\r\nof nature. Hence he reckoned it among the choicest favours vouchsafed\r\nhim by Providence, that he had been “inspired with an inclination for\r\nscience so passionate, as to become the source of highest delight to\r\nhim.” His diligence and minute observation were continually adding to\r\nhis knowledge, and imparting some fresh light in the study he loved.\r\nIndeed, after mentioning with evident satisfaction the honours showed\r\nhim, Linnæus somewhat significantly, and very curtly, adds, “Thus was\r\nhe obliged to be a courtier, contrary to his inclination.” From his own\r\naccount of his personal appearance we learn that he was a little below\r\nthe standard height, and of a strong and compact figure. He rather\r\nstooped in walking, having contracted this habit from the frequent\r\nexamination of plants and other objects. His head was large, and a good\r\ndeal raised behind, and there was a wart on the side of his cheek. His\r\nhair was of a dark brown, till silvered by age, when his brow became much\r\nfurrowed and wrinkled. His eyes were brown, bright and piercing, and\r\nhis sight exceedingly keen. His ear, too, was very acute, and quick in\r\ncatching every sound, except that of music, in which he took no delight.\r\n\r\nHis natural temperament, he tells us, was vivacious; prompt to joy,\r\nsorrow, and anger, but the latter was speedily appeased, and he was\r\nso averse to disputes that he never would answer any of his numerous\r\nassailants. In his early days he was full of energy and spirit, and\r\nthrough life his movements were rapid and agile. In his habits he\r\nobserved the strictest temperance and method. He never delayed anything\r\nhe had to do, and noted down immediately what he wished to remember. He\r\nhas recorded that he never neglected a lecture; and by rigid economy of\r\ntime, and a regular and exact distribution of the hours, he completed\r\nthose extraordinary labours which remain lasting proofs of his talents,\r\nacuteness, and industry.\r\n\r\nOf his wife, Linnæus makes honourable mention, and numbers her as among\r\nthe choice gifts bestowed on him. “She was,” he says, “the wife for\r\nwhom he most wished, and who managed his household affairs while he was\r\nengaged in laborious studies.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1764 was marked by several events of domestic interest in\r\nthe life of Linnæus. Early in the spring he was attacked by a violent\r\npleurisy, which threatened to cut short his existence. He relates how,\r\nwith great difficulty, and through the kind assistance and consummate\r\nskill of Rosen, his present friend and old enemy, he was brought\r\nsafely through the crisis. It is truly pleasing to read in his private\r\nmemoranda, the gratitude he felt to his old rival, and the expressions\r\nof intimate regard which thenceforward prevailed between them. Recovered\r\nfrom this illness, Linnæus retired to Hammarby, to enjoy the fresh\r\ninvigorating air of the country, and to celebrate his “Silfer Bröllop,”\r\na Swedish custom of commemorating the twenty-fifth return of the wedding\r\nday. One of his most celebrated pupils, Professor Fabricius, has given\r\nsome interesting particulars respecting his eminent master at this period\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\n“For two whole years,” he says, “I was so fortunate as to enjoy his\r\ninstruction, guidance, and confidential friendship. When I became\r\nacquainted with the Chevalier von Linné, although he had not attained\r\nhis sixtieth year, increasing age had already furrowed his brow with\r\nwrinkles. His countenance was open, almost constantly serene, and bore\r\ngreat resemblance to his portrait in the book called Species Plantarum.\r\nBut his eyes, of all the eyes I ever saw, were the most beautiful.\r\nThey certainly were but small, but they shone with a brilliancy, and\r\nhad a degree of penetration, such as I never observed in another man.\r\nHis mind was noble and elevated, though I well know some persons have\r\naccused him of several faults. But his greatest excellence consisted\r\nin the systematic order of his thoughts. Whatever he did or said was\r\nfaithful to order, truth, and regularity. His passions were strong\r\nand violent, his heart open to every impression of joy, and he loved\r\njocularity, conviviality, and good living. An excellent companion, he\r\nwas pleasant in conversation, and full of entertaining stories; at the\r\nsame time, suddenly roused to anger, he was boisterous and violent, but\r\nimmediately his displeasure subsided, and he was all good-humour again.\r\nHis friendship was sure and invariable, science being generally its\r\nbasis; and every one who knew him must be aware what concern he always\r\nmanifested for his pupils, and with how much zeal they returned his\r\nfriendship. In summer we followed him into the country. Our life was then\r\nmuch happier. Our dwelling was about a quarter of a league distant from\r\nhis house at Hammarby, in a farm. He rose very early in summer, mostly\r\nabout four o’clock. At six he came to us, because his house was then\r\nbuilding, breakfasted with us, and gave lectures upon the natural orders\r\nof plants as long as he pleased, and generally till about ten o’clock.\r\nWe then wandered about among the neighbouring rocks, the productions\r\nof which afforded us plenty of entertainment. In the afternoon we went\r\nto his garden, and in the evening mostly played at the Swedish game of\r\ntrissett, in company with the ladies. Occasionally, the whole family\r\ncame to spend the day with us, and then we sent for a peasant, who\r\nplayed on an instrument resembling a violin, to which we danced in the\r\nbarn of our farm-house; and though the company was but small, and the\r\ndances superlatively rustic, we passed the time merrily. While we danced,\r\nLinnæus sat looking on, and smoking his pipe; sometimes, though very\r\nrarely, he danced a Polish dance, in which he excelled every one of us\r\nyoung men. He was exceedingly delighted when he saw us in high glee,\r\nnay, even if we became noisy. His only anxiety was, that we might be\r\nwell entertained. Those days, those hours, will never be erased from my\r\nmemory, and every remembrance of them is grateful to my heart!”\r\n\r\nHe seems, before sending it, to have added at the close a sort of\r\nsummary of his deeds, his merits, his honours, and his obligations.\r\nWith the scrupulous care, and love of truth and justice, which always\r\ncharacterized him, he reckoned up, under the latter head, the various\r\naids afforded him by his pupils and friends; and, conscious of his higher\r\nobligations, he enumerated the favours he had received from the Divine\r\nhand which he acknowledged had led and prospered him. He had permitted\r\nhim to visit His secret council chambers, and to see more of the creation\r\nthan any mortal before him, and given him greater knowledge of natural\r\nhistory than any one had hitherto acquired. Even beneath the pressure of\r\nincreasing infirmities, the fondness of Linnæus for his beloved studies\r\ncontinued undiminished, and his desire of adding to his knowledge was\r\nkeen as ever. Some of his letters at this period are full of vivacity,\r\nand strikingly express the ardour of his zeal. An idea of their spirit\r\nmay be gained from a short extract taken from one, dated August 8th,\r\n1771. “I received an hour ago,” he writes, “yours of the 16th July, nor\r\ndid I ever get a more welcome letter, as it contains the happy tidings\r\nof my dear Solander’s safe return. Thanks and glory to God, who has\r\nprotected him through the dangers of such a voyage. If I were not bound\r\nfast here, by sixty-four years of age and a worn-out body, I would this\r\nvery day set out for London, to see this great hero in botany. Moses was\r\nnot permitted to enter Palestine, but only to view it from a distance; so\r\nI conceive an idea in my mind of the acquisitions and treasures of those\r\nwho have visited every part of the globe.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1774, while lecturing in the Botanic Garden, he suffered\r\nan attack of apoplexy, the debilitating effects of which obliged him to\r\nrelinquish all active professional duties, and to close his literary\r\noccupations. In 1776 a second seizure supervened, which rendered him\r\nparalytic on the right side, and impaired his mental powers so much that\r\nhe became a distressing spectacle. Yet, even then, with the natural\r\nflow of cheerfulness so peculiar to him, he thus described his own\r\nsituation:—“Linnæus limps, can hardly walk, speaks unintelligibly, and\r\nis scarce able to write.” Nature remained, to the last, his sole comfort\r\nand relief. He used to be carried to his museum, where he gazed on the\r\ntreasures he had collected with so much care and labour, and as long\r\nas possible he continued to manifest peculiar delight in examining the\r\nrarities and new productions which had been latterly added to them by\r\nsome of his pupils.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to find a more striking illustration of the\r\n“ruling passion strong in death,” than is afforded in the instance of\r\nLinnæus. Lingering and painful were the last twelve months of his\r\nexistence; but at length, on the 10th January, 1778, he gently expired\r\nin his sleep, in the seventy-first year of his age. The death of Linnæus\r\nwas regarded, in Sweden, as a national calamity. The whole University\r\nwent into mourning, and all the professors, doctors, and students then\r\nat Upsala, attended his funeral. The king, in his speech to the States\r\nin the same year, publicly lamented his death, and ordered a medal to be\r\nstruck in his honour; and in 1798 a monument was erected to him in the\r\ncathedral at Upsala, where he was interred.\r\n\r\nSuch a life needs but little comment. It speaks for itself to the youth\r\nleaving school and knowing not what to do, to the young man struggling\r\nfor existence and position, to the middle-aged man in his wealth and\r\ninfluence, and to the old man who cares to leave a good name behind him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSOLIDATION OF THE SCIENCE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\n    The life of De Candolle—The Natural System.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a name which is very familiar to young and old botanists\r\nnowadays, and which is always mentioned with feelings of great respect.\r\nIt is that of M. de Candolle, one of the founders of the modern system of\r\nthe classification of plants which is used by everybody now in preference\r\nto the celebrated artificial method taught by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nAugustin Pyramus de Candolle was born at Geneva, in February, 1778,\r\nand his father, M. Augustine de Candolle, was descended from one of\r\nthe oldest families of Provence. One of his ancestors, M. Pyramus de\r\nCandolle, became a Protestant, and left France for the freer air of\r\nSwitzerland, and settled at Geneva in 1591. This gentleman became a\r\ncitizen of the town, a member of the legislature, and took up the\r\nbusiness of a printer. His presses gave forth translations of the works\r\nof Tacitus and Xenophon.\r\n\r\nThey were stirring times, and this energetic man once, in travelling\r\nthrough Grenoble into Switzerland, learned that the Duke of Savoy\r\nintended to take Geneva by surprise, with his army. When the attempt\r\nwas made, Pyramus de Candolle fought as a citizen of his adopted town.\r\nSubsequently he went to Yverdun and established manufactories, but the\r\njealousy of the Bernese ruined him, and he died broken-hearted. The\r\nfamily returned to Geneva to live on small means, and the father of De\r\nCandolle became a banker, and was much employed by the State during\r\ntroublous political times.\r\n\r\nAn industrious, simple, loving, clever man was the father, and he\r\nmarried Mademoiselle Brière. De Candolle wrote of his mother: “She was\r\nan educated woman, good, fond of fun, and clever; she was gifted with\r\nall the graces and virtues of the mind, and she contributed by her\r\namiable conversations and teachings to give me a taste for science and\r\nliterature. She had only one fault, and it strangely enough influenced my\r\ncharacter. She was proud of her family, which she considered was superior\r\nin station to that of my father, because her mother was a distant\r\nrelation of La Fort, the minister of Peter the Great of Russia. She took\r\nevery opportunity of making my father feel this pretended superiority, so\r\nthat when he became forty-eight years of age, he thought that he would\r\nmake himself known to his relatives and take up his nobility in Provence,\r\nand show his wife that his descent was better than hers. But my father\r\ntook every opportunity of teaching me that ability alone was the real\r\ndistinction amongst men, and that nobility by itself was nothing, and was\r\na matter of accident. So that my mother’s exaggerated family notions,\r\nand my father’s wise precepts, coming as they did to me, during times\r\nof political change, developed in me a sincere love for freedom, and a\r\ncontempt for all success except that which was deserved.” De Candolle was\r\nborn when his father was in active office, and the earliest recollections\r\nof the future naturalist were about his father’s military command, and\r\nthe endeavours of this good citizen to pacify the populace and the\r\nruling powers, who were always in opposition. The little fellow was\r\nalways ill, and lost much of the outdoor play of his companions; but\r\nthere was compensation, for he learned to read fairly soon, and at five\r\nyears of age he used to read and pretend to act plays; and his heart\r\nwas in his studies, for when M. de Florian, an author, came to see the\r\nfamily, the child told him that he was going to write comedies, and had\r\nacted them. At seven years of age he was far in advance, and then came\r\nillness—scarlet fever, ear-ache, and threatening brain disease. He used\r\nto say in after years that he well remembered seeing everything looking\r\ndouble. His recovery was very slow, and he was taken to the country to a\r\nbrisk air, and then he began to be robust, and for fifty years after he\r\nnever spent a day in bed. But his father did not send him to the public\r\nschool; he employed a tutor, and the child learned nothing during three\r\nyears. Then came a little country life, and the friendship of a man, a\r\ndistinguished naturalist, Mr. Charles Bonnet. His first start in science\r\nwas homely enough. His mother used to collect the herbs and fruit out of\r\nthe garden, and the boy used to arrange what she gathered, keeping the\r\ndifferent kinds separate with an exactitude that made everybody amazed.\r\nHe said that he ought to arrange the fruit according to their natures.\r\n\r\nWhen eleven years of age, De Candolle was sent to the college at Geneva,\r\nand was placed in the fourth class, under a master of only moderate\r\npowers of teaching. No great progress was made in study, and the boy was\r\nrarely seen in the upper part of the class. One day his father came to\r\nthe college to inquire how the boy was getting on, and being a Government\r\nofficial was, of course, well received. A little arrangement by the\r\nmaster, which excited the contempt of the boy, placed him at the head\r\nof the class, and so unfair did this seem that the little fellow told\r\nhis father that he had no right to be there. However, he was removed\r\nto the third class, and fortunately came under a better master. Young\r\nDe Candolle played hard and got more healthy, and his studies were not\r\nonerous. In fact, his mother did more for him than the school. She taught\r\nhim his native language, and gave him a love for poetry. But this was\r\nalmost crushed out by the foolish method of teaching in the school. If\r\na boy wanted a holiday he had to write to the rector of the college\r\nfor it in Latin verse, and of course children of twelve years of age\r\ncould not compose sufficiently well. So they copied, and the result\r\nwas that, year after year, the rector received a collection of Latin\r\nletters which resembled those of the year before, and this had gone on\r\nfor several generations. However, the boy wrote to the rector in French\r\nverse, and in original verse. This was considered something out of the\r\ncommon, and the boy was praised, and his peculiar gift was fostered.\r\nHe became very intimate with a school-fellow named Gaudy, who had the\r\nsame tastes, and they used to spend much of their time in turning Latin\r\nprose and poetry into very bad French verse. Soon after his old fondness\r\nfor acting returned, and he was successful in private theatricals. The\r\nboy worked hard at this amusement, and learned many of the great French\r\ntragedies and comedies, and although the time was apparently wasted, yet\r\nDe Candolle used to say that it did his memory good, gave him a good\r\nstyle, and took away nervousness. Then his father gave him a good private\r\ntutor, and the boy entered the first class. There he found a master who\r\ninsisted on regular and profitable study, besides Latin verse, and the\r\nresult was that De Candolle began to distinguish himself and took prizes.\r\nOne prize which he gained, made him think very deeply afterwards. It was\r\nan essay relating to the existence of God. De Candolle wrote his essay in\r\nfour hours, and it consisted of from fifteen to twenty pages; it included\r\nall he had learned of his catechism, what he remembered of many sermons,\r\nand a host of quotations from the Bible. But although the youth got the\r\nprize, and was much applauded, he felt that he was a complete stranger to\r\nthe spirit of the truths he had written, and that his heart had little to\r\ndo with the sentences which came from his pen. He learned religion just\r\nas he learned Greek and Latin. In 1792 De Candolle left the college and\r\nbegan to study literature, and, released from the troublesome discipline\r\nof the class, worked as if he were a man. But things did not go on\r\nsmoothly, for the political troubles of that age soon affected Geneva.\r\nA French army occupied Savoy and encamped near Geneva. The Government\r\nprepared to defend the town, and the fathers of families began to send\r\ntheir wives and children into the interior of Switzerland. De Candolle\r\nwas in despair when his father told him and his brother to accompany\r\ntheir mother; he longed to fight for his country, but he had to leave,\r\nand they went to Champagne, a small village near Grandison, where the\r\nfather, foreseeing the trouble, had bought an estate. There the summer\r\nand autumn were passed peaceably, and in superintending the vines, the\r\ngathering of the grapes, and managing the property with his mother.\r\nMontesquieu, the French general, did not care about crushing the little\r\ntown of Geneva, and other matters called him away. So the immediate\r\ndanger passed and the family returned to Geneva.\r\n\r\nThe youth returned to his studies amidst popular discontent within\r\nthe town. A revolution occurred, and a provisional committee occupied\r\nthe position of the former Government. Strangely enough this occurred\r\nwhilst De Candolle’s father was chief magistrate, and the Government\r\nfell whilst he was in office. Of course the man who had done so much for\r\nthe town was obliged to go into exile, and he left for his little estate\r\nat Champagne, leaving his son behind to pursue his studies. The youth\r\nwas left under the charge of his tutor, a young married man, and much\r\ngood work was done, and in 1793 he rejoined his father. During the next\r\nyear M. Vaucher gave some lectures on botany in the very modest little\r\nBotanical Garden of Geneva. He was a clergyman and Professor of Theology,\r\nbut his amusements led him to study plants, and especially those which\r\nlive in fresh water. His manner of teaching and the subject, attracted\r\nDe Candolle, and indeed so much so that he felt that botany would be his\r\nspecial study through life. What he learned from M. Vaucher was about\r\nthe principal organs of plants, and he began to get books describing\r\nplants and to endeavour to describe for himself. Singularly enough, the\r\nmethodical courses of study which De Candolle had undergone assisted him;\r\nfor although he obtained some botanical works of a very indifferent kind,\r\nwhich would have satisfied most youths, he began to see their errors\r\nof method. Knowing nothing of the labours of the great botanists, the\r\nyouth managed to see his way to the most reasonable plan of describing\r\nplants, and he noticed the organs, one after the other, in the proper\r\nmanner. Teaching himself the rudiments of the study of plants, and giving\r\nmuch time also to literature, young De Candolle remained much at home,\r\nfor Geneva was in a horrible state of political revolution. Robespierre\r\nmanaged to send emissaries there, and most of the better class of\r\ncitizens were imprisoned. De Candolle’s father was sentenced to death,\r\nbut being away from the town the sentence had no effect. This state\r\nof things lasted for some time, until the good sense of the majority\r\nannulled the sentence and restored order. Many Genevese emigrated to\r\nAmerica, and when De Candolle returned to his studies he found the town\r\nsad, and nearly all his old friends exiled or gone in disgust. He had no\r\namusements and therefore his studies were prosecuted with vigour, and he\r\nbegan a course of natural philosophy. In 1796 he left his studies and\r\nspent the summer with his father, reading good botanical works on the\r\nnatural philosophy of trees, the uses of leaves; and, what was of more\r\nimportance, he wandered far and wide over the Jura Mountains, collecting\r\nplants to describe and study. He got Linnæus’s European Botany, and soon\r\nbegan to learn many plants by their proper names. But he used Linnæus’s\r\nbook as a simple dictionary, for he saw that although the names of plants\r\ncould be easily found out by it, there were plants grouped together in\r\nit that had no close resemblance in their most important parts. At this\r\ntime his interest in his study was intensified by a terrible instance\r\nwhich he witnessed of the hidden powers of simple-looking plants. He saw\r\nthree little children die who had eaten belladonna berries.\r\n\r\nWhen eighteen years of age, De Candolle went to Paris and lived in the\r\nsame house as Dolomieu, a very distinguished mineralogist, a wise and\r\nmoderate man whose simplicity charmed the young man. This wise friend did\r\nnot press his special study on De Candolle, but advised him to follow his\r\nfondness for botany, giving him, however, some little insight into the\r\nnature of crystals and their laws of form. De Candolle then learned that\r\nthere was a philosophy in stones, and he always stated in after life that\r\nthis instruction made him think about the philosophy which linked plants\r\ntogether in the scheme of creation. He had an instructive conversation\r\nwith a well-known botanist, about the structure of the stems of palms and\r\ngrapes—which differ so much from those of the oak, plane, willow—and of\r\nordinary shrubs; and this distinction of two great groups of plants gave\r\nhim an insight into some of the grand distinctions between plants, and\r\nwhich enabled hundreds of species or genera to be grouped and separated.\r\nUnfortunately, at the time of his arrival at Paris, the botanical courses\r\nat the college were not being given, so he began to attend the lectures\r\non chemistry, physics, and mineralogy. He often went to hear Cuvier, the\r\ngreat comparative anatomist, whose great ability and dignity of manner\r\nimpressed everybody, and he made the acquaintance of the still greater\r\nLamarck in a very curious manner. De Candolle had seen M. de Lamarck at\r\nthe French Academy of Sciences, but he did not know anybody who could\r\nintroduce him to the great man. However, he found out that Lamarck\r\nused to dine at the same little restaurant which he patronized. So a\r\nlittle plan was adopted to draw the celebrated zoologist and botanist\r\ninto conversation. De Candolle asked his friend Pictet, who afterwards\r\nbecame a professor at Geneva and a great man, to come by chance as it\r\nwere and sit beside him at the same table as Lamarck, and they began a\r\nconversation about botany. De Candolle especially stated how useful he\r\nhad found a book called the “Description of the French Plants” in his\r\nstudies. This was overheard by Lamarck, who was the author of it, and he\r\njoined in the conversation. Lamarck asked the young man to come and see\r\nhim, and a friendship commenced; and although they did not have at that\r\ntime much to say to one another about botany, still the distinguished\r\nFrench naturalist gave good advice, and, when De Candolle left Paris,\r\npresented him with a letter and a book to give to M. Sénebier, of Geneva,\r\nwhose friendship probably decided the future career of the rising young\r\nbotanist. Certainly the acquaintance of Lamarck stimulated De Candolle\r\nto study the physiology of plants—how they grow, breathe, how the sap\r\ncirculates, how the colours are produced, and how the young seeds\r\nare formed. The happy circumstances which surrounded the young man at\r\nParis enabled him to see the great comedies of the day and to admire\r\nthe splendid acting at the theatres. But he was a philosopher then, and\r\nhe could not but be struck with the furious gaiety of society and the\r\ngreat frivolity of the day, and with that careless method of living\r\nand thinking which followed as a kind of revulsion on the awful scenes\r\nof the Revolution and the Reign of Terror. In the spring of 1797, De\r\nCandolle returned to Geneva. There he studied the physiology of plants\r\nwith M. Sénebier, going to his father’s house in the holidays, which were\r\nspent in botanical excursions. In one of these, on the Jura Mountains,\r\nDe Candolle discovered a new fungus of a beautiful red colour, and his\r\nadventure in obtaining the specimen was very characteristic of the man.\r\nOn the sides of those hills are many very precipitous trough-like paths,\r\ndown which the wood-cutters pass the fir trees they cut high up on the\r\nmountains, to the valleys. They are rugged at the sides, and have really\r\nbeen worn out of the hills by running water and the rushing downwards of\r\nthe trees. Active people can slide down these “couloirs” by sitting on a\r\nstick placed between one’s legs, and down went young De Candolle in that\r\nfashion. As he rushed along, he saw a beautiful red plant on a branch of\r\na tree overhanging the couloir, and as he slid down he managed to cut the\r\nbranch and obtain his prize—his first new plant to describe. But it was\r\ndone at the expense of his clothes, which got torn off from him in many\r\nparts, by the rocks, so that he had to slink home to avoid being seen.\r\nWorking hard at botany, the young enthusiast had very agreeable hours\r\nof relaxation. He was in the midst of a charming homely society; and\r\nthere is no doubt that his purity of character and thorough honesty of\r\ndisposition were fostered and intensified, by his having the friendship\r\nof several young married and single women of good education and position.\r\nThey made him a polished gentleman, and he used to say that that was the\r\nhappy time of his life; he had no cares or anxieties, everything smiled\r\non him, yet he was conscious that it must end, and that he must prepare\r\nfor work and the struggle of life.\r\n\r\nPolitics were always the trouble of the De Candolle family, and they\r\nsettled the future career of the young botanist. Geneva was about to\r\nbecome a portion of the French Republic, the father of De Candolle lost\r\none-half of his fortune, and the young man went to Paris to learn how\r\nto earn his bread after preliminary study. He had a sad parting from\r\nthe father who had been so good to him, and who loved him so well, and\r\narrived at Paris, being received by an uncle, in March, 1798. After a\r\nfew days of quietude, which he spent in calling on his former friends,\r\nhe determined to go into lodgings near the Jardin des Plantes, and to\r\nwork, leaving pleasure behind him, and to be sought for when he could\r\nafford it. He began to study medicine, and led the odd life of a\r\nmedical student, attended to by old crones in their second childhood,\r\nand witnessing all the sad sights of the hospitals. Whenever he could,\r\nhe made his way to the Botanical Garden, and yet he did not attend the\r\nlectures on botany. He found them not consistent with what he knew. But\r\nhe was ever studying, describing, and observing plants, and, knowing\r\nnobody at the gardens, sought out Lamarck, who offered him some articles\r\nin his Encyclopædia to write. The articles were written, and mistakes\r\nwere naturally made, and in after years they were readily acknowledged\r\nand set right. But the work did not advance the young botanist in his\r\nstudies, although it confirmed him in the necessity of examining all the\r\nparts of a plant in classifying it, and in paying especial attention to\r\nthose organs which are the most important to the life and reproduction\r\nof the kind. Leaving his lodgings to board with a friend, De Candolle\r\nwas robbed, as was usual in those days, by his housekeepers; but he got\r\ninto a worse scrape by being inveigled into a gambling-house, where he\r\nlost nearly all the money he had earned. It cured him of that folly. At\r\nwork he began to make experiments on the action of different gases on the\r\nroots of plants, and obtained some curious results; and M. Desfontaines,\r\nthe Professor of Botany, gave him hints about the correct method of\r\ndescribing plants, so as to enable him to write the letterpress to the\r\nplates of a work on those succulent plants called Crassulaceæ, of\r\nwhich the houseleek and stonecrops are familiar examples. Medicine was\r\nquite given up; and, in fact, it was hateful to De Candolle, who used\r\nto say, “If I make a mistake in naming a plant, I can set it right, but\r\nif I had made mistakes as a medical man, who knows how many dear little\r\nchildren I might not have killed?” He became a friend of the Delessert\r\nfamily, and met at their house all those rising naturalists who were\r\nforming the great French school, and this society was of great importance\r\nto him. Botanical excursions to Fontainebleau were made by him, with\r\nBrongniart, Cuvier, and Dumeril, all great men in their day, and then\r\nhe went botanizing into Normandy, and nearly got drowned collecting\r\nseaweeds. Returning to Paris, he was fortunate enough to be again kindly\r\nlooked after by some good families, and he became attached to Mdlle.\r\nFanny Torras, one of a bright circle of ladies who liked the brilliant\r\nconversation and good manners of the rising young man. Going to Holland\r\nfor a trip, De Candolle was struck with the curious vegetation of the\r\nhills or dunes of sand near the coast, and this appears to have attracted\r\nhis attention to the geographical distribution of plants. Nevertheless,\r\nand in spite of all those attractions, he studied human anatomy and\r\nzoology. In course of time he went home to Champagne, and his future\r\nmarriage was agreed upon. On his return to Paris, he was received as the\r\nfuture husband of Mdlle. Torras.\r\n\r\nHe studied the “sleep of plants,” the classification of the Vetches,\r\nwas presented at the Institute, and elected a member of the Société\r\nPhilomathique, where he met and became the associate of his old botanical\r\ncompanions at Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a singular political position which was thrust\r\nupon this young man of twenty-two years of age, decided his future\r\ncareer, for it brought him under the eye of Napoleon Bonaparte, the\r\nFirst Consul of France. Geneva nominated him as a “notable” to whom the\r\nconsul might apply for information about the requirements of the town.\r\nDe Candolle wrote in his memoirs: “I was not much of a partisan. Born\r\na republican, a friend of peace, I saw with anxiety Napoleon’s evident\r\nlove of war and desire for monarchy, but I was obliged to look favourably\r\non him, for he had destroyed anarchy, and possessed great abilities.”\r\nNapoleon and the young man had two interviews, one a peaceable one, which\r\ndid good to the town of Geneva, and a second and stormy one, during\r\nwhich the simple student of the truth stood up, like a man, against the\r\nangry despot, and quailed not beneath that eye which most men feared.\r\nHe was not forgotten, however, and after a while he was nominated on a\r\ncommission to investigate the teaching given in the schools of Paris,\r\nunder the charge of laymen. This commission was necessary, for the Roman\r\nCatholic authorities were anxious to put down lay teaching. De Candolle,\r\na firm Protestant, took great care in making his report, and he decided\r\nthat although there was much to be desired, still the lay schools were\r\ndoing their duty.\r\n\r\nPursuing his studies, De Candolle began to form an herbarium, and his\r\ntime was divided between science and philanthropy—for he was a visitor\r\nat the hospitals and prisons of Paris—and his Fanny, whom he married in\r\n1802. Immediately afterwards he began to write his description of the\r\nplants of France, and Cuvier asked him to lecture for him during a term.\r\nThe subject chosen was the physiology of plants; it was well managed, and\r\nit tempted De Candolle to head his new book with some chapters on it.\r\nGrief came in due time; De Candolle and his wife lost their firstborn,\r\na pretty little girl, and a long absence from Paris was necessary. On\r\ntheir return, De Candolle recommenced his work on his book, and after its\r\ncompletion he began a series of excursions in different parts of France,\r\nstudying the botany and geology. After a while a son was born, and De\r\nCandolle was offered the professorship of Botany at Montpellier.\r\n\r\nHe visited the city to see how he liked it, and he took this opportunity,\r\nalso, to go to the Pyrenees for a botanical trip, collecting at the time\r\nmany interesting plants. A difficulty existed about the acceptance of\r\nthe position, for there was much teaching required, and there would not\r\nbe much time for these excursions about France, which were absolutely\r\nnecessary for the knowledge of the different local assemblages of plants\r\nor floras. De Candolle had a salary of about £160 a year, which enabled\r\nhim to start from Paris and to botanize. If he went to Montpellier, all\r\nhis original work might cease, and he could not earn this money and teach\r\nat the same time. So, loving real work, he determined not to accept the\r\nposition. A great endeavour was being made, however, to restore the\r\nteaching of natural history at Montpellier, and the friends of the young\r\nman called on the then Minister of the Interior, M. Cretet, and urged\r\nhim to see the rising botanist. At the interview Mr. Cretet, who had no\r\nbotanical tastes, was wonderfully amused at a man’s giving up a good\r\nplace for the sake of running about France picking up plants, and said,\r\nin a good-humoured manner, “Now, young man, if you don’t take both the\r\nsituations you shan’t have either.” The professorship at Montpellier\r\nwas accepted, and the necessary journeys were to be allowed. This M.\r\nCretet seems to have been a man of great sense, and quite upset M. de\r\nLaplace, the great mathematician, about De Candolle. Laplace wanted to\r\npay a compliment to the minister, and also to bring the young botanist\r\nbefore his notice, so he said, “Sir, you have done us a doubtful service\r\nin sending M. de Candolle to Montpellier, for we expected soon to have\r\nhim as a member of the Institute.” M. Cretet turned on him with an angry\r\nair and said, “Your institute! Do you know what I should like to do with\r\nyour institute?” “What?” said Laplace, rather astonished at the tone of\r\nvoice. “I should like to fire a cannon well into the middle of it.” M.\r\nde Laplace seemed as if he would sink. “Yes,” continued the minister, “I\r\nwould fire a cannon at you all, and disperse you all over France. It is\r\nfrightful to concentrate all the lights of the age in Paris, and to leave\r\nthe departments in ignorance and idleness! I have sent M. de Candolle\r\nto Montpellier to stimulate others to activity.” Considering that the\r\nmembers of the Institute of France have always considered themselves the\r\nvery cream of the cream of science, this was very shocking.\r\n\r\nThe new professor started with his wife, little boy, his library and\r\nherbarium, and with many a regret at leaving such friends as those who\r\nenlightened Paris as anatomists and botanists. It was a great position\r\nfor a man of thirty years of age, however, and it gave him sufficient to\r\nlive upon; and this was welcome, for hitherto he had been poor.\r\n\r\nWhen he was settled in his new establishment his father, then seventy-two\r\nyears of age, came to see him, and, after a short sojourn, took his\r\nleave, accompanied by his daughter-in-law and grandson. Whilst they all\r\nwent to Geneva, De Candolle prepared for and went on an excursion into\r\nItaly. During the visit to Italy, in 1808, politics came in the way of\r\nbotany, and nothing was heard of De Candolle for a month, his letters\r\nhaving gone astray; but he turned up at Geneva, well, and in good\r\nspirits, for he heard that he had a chance of being made a member of the\r\nInstitute. But he found that even great scientific men have their little\r\nfoibles and favourites, and he did not get elected. In fact, he never\r\nwas elected a member, although he was the most distinguished botanist\r\nof the age. Years afterwards, when he was in Geneva, he was made one of\r\nthe eight foreign members, and that has always been considered a great\r\nhonour. Nevertheless, politics, social position, and agreement with the\r\nauthorities of the day, on all subjects, are of very considerable moment\r\nin these elections.\r\n\r\nThe return to Montpellier was sad, but the fine sunshine of the south,\r\nand cheerful society, soon made De Candolle forget his disappointment.\r\nAfter a botanical trip in Savoy, De Candolle wrote an important volume on\r\ngeographical botany and agriculture. The first of these subjects infers a\r\nthorough knowledge of the names and kinds of plants, and it is of great\r\nimportance in associating certain plants with soils, rocks, and climates.\r\n\r\nBy November, 1811, De Candolle had nearly completed his botanical\r\ntours, and he then considered that he was settled at Montpellier for\r\na long time, and that his work would be more that of a teacher than\r\ninvestigator. He found that travelling and collecting had enlarged his\r\nmind, and he never regretted the six years of wandering about. About\r\nthis time the young professor commenced a great work on the statistics\r\nof French vegetation. It did not deal with descriptions of species, or\r\nof the special localities where they could be found; but, first, with\r\nthe general distribution of wild plants in France, and then with the\r\nrelation of the plants of France to the different wants of mankind.\r\nThis last part was eminently practical, and it dealt with food plants,\r\nmedicinal plants, dye plants, and those which are used for clothing.\r\nIt was a prodigious attempt, and it never came to a conclusion; only\r\nfragments of it were in his possession fourteen years afterwards, and he\r\nattributed much of the difficulty thrown in his way, to the alterations\r\nwhich occurred in the boundaries of France after the fall of Napoleon.\r\nMoreover, he had to complete his description of the plants of France, and\r\nthat was not done until 1815.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle was always fond of society, and, after his labours of the\r\nday, was glad to go into or receive company. Being a Protestant, and\r\na man of mark in his native town, he was well received by most of the\r\nfamilies of Montpellier, and his wife also. Society consisted of good\r\nProtestant families of old, so-called nobles, and some who thought\r\nthemselves nobles. It was split up like the society of most small towns,\r\ninto cliques, but De Candolle escaped, for a long time, any discomforts\r\nor social antagonisms. They came at last, however.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle, like many active-minded men, was not popular with the\r\nofficials who had “places” in their gift. He was intrigued against,\r\nand lost the rectorship of the University, but he had the pleasure of\r\nexposing the intrigue in 1813.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had fought his last fight, and had gone to Elba, and the\r\nBourbons had been restored. Disgusted with the military spirit of the\r\nEmpire, De Candolle rejoiced at the restoration of the Bourbons, and even\r\nbecame a volunteer to keep the town in order. He began to change his mind\r\nsoon, however, for the Count d’Artois, one of the royal family, received\r\nthe professor with great haughtiness, and, by way of making amends, paid\r\nparticular attention to a rascal of the first water who had returned from\r\nthe galleys, where he had been sent for stealing, and not for devotion\r\nto the Bourbons, as he told the duke. Going to Geneva on a visit, to\r\nplace his eldest son at school, De Candolle found the city just being\r\nreceived into the Confederation of the Swiss Republic. He returned to\r\nMontpellier, which was full of rejoicing at Napoleon’s exile, but shortly\r\nafterwards all was disorder during the hundred days in which Napoleon\r\nwas, for the last time, ruler of France. Beyond the reach of direct\r\npolitics, the professors of Montpellier had their little evenings, and\r\neven got up private theatricals. In the midst of a scene in one of these\r\ncame the news that Napoleon had landed at Cannes, and was on his way to\r\nParis. That was the last quiet hour that De Candolle had in the town.\r\nAn unfriendly man, who was a royalist, began to set people against the\r\nprofessor, who resented their interference. He began to limit his circle\r\nof friends, left literature alone more and more, and plunged more deeply\r\ninto science. He determined to leave Montpellier and its littlenesses.\r\nHis principal care was to enlarge and utilize the botanic garden of the\r\nplace, and then he devoted much time to teaching, and with great success.\r\nCivil war was imminent, and the defeat at Waterloo produced outbreaks\r\nat Montpellier. De Candolle had been elected Rector of the University\r\nduring the Hundred Days, and was ordered to give up the title. This he\r\ndid, and prepared to leave the place. He had sent his family to Geneva,\r\nand in travelling himself to join them, by way of Nimes, he saw traces\r\nof the horrible treatment the Protestants had received. Subsequently the\r\nfamily went to Paris, passing through the towns occupied by the allied\r\ntroops. Having time, De Candolle visited England, and became the guest\r\nof Dr. Marcet, and was introduced to the best of the scientific world.\r\nHe met and enjoyed the reticent Robert Brown, and went to a sitting of\r\nthe Royal Society, which he said was dull. He was introduced to Hooker\r\nand Sir James Smith, the proprietor of the Herbarium of Linnæus, which\r\nhe very properly said was the basis of botanical nomenclature. In 1816\r\nDe Candolle found himself settling down in his native town of Geneva,\r\nwhere he was well received, and became Professor of Natural History, and\r\ntaught students of both sexes, and began to establish a botanic garden of\r\nsome importance. There he was obliged to go into local politics, and for\r\nyears was a representative of the town, doing good work for the poor, for\r\nliberty by receiving and protecting political fugitives and by insisting\r\non the freedom of the press, which was considerably hated in France under\r\nthe restored Bourbons. Nevertheless, year after year he taught well,\r\nand most of the great botanists of later years were either his students\r\nor his visitors and friends. As age crept on, De Candolle continued his\r\nresearches, and got through the description and classification of a\r\nconsiderable number of known plants. These were published in a book which\r\nwill always be his masterpiece. Honours crowded on him, the gifts of\r\nlearned societies of all nations, and he visited most of the great cities\r\nof the Continent. In 1832 he published the second part of his work. He\r\nhad great happiness with his wife, and his parents lived to great ages,\r\ncontent with the prosperity of their son, who was ever good and loving\r\nto them, and got his reward. He had a little estate, out of Geneva, at\r\nSaint Seine, and enjoyed it much; but, as years rolled on, the death of\r\na son there, affected his tender heart, and he sold the place and bought\r\nanother, called La Barrière, near Geneva. His eldest son, Alphonse,\r\nfollowed well in the father’s steps. Finally, when old age troubled De\r\nCandolle, he gave up his professorship.\r\n\r\nIll health succeeded, but the man worked on at his great book, and even\r\nentered the political arena once again at a time of emergency. The winter\r\nof 1840-41 was one of illness, and he could no longer work. His friends\r\nwere dying off, month after month, and when death came to him, he was\r\ncontent. He had been a good son, an excellent father, a loving friend,\r\na true patriot, deserving everything that elevated mankind; and it is\r\nadmitted by all botanists that he consolidated the science, and gave it\r\na definite natural classification.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle early in life grasped the truth that plants grow, reproduce,\r\nand arrive at maturity, not by accident, but according to natural law,\r\nand he soon saw that some parts of plants were of more importance to\r\ntheir well-being and multiplication than others. He was thus a follower\r\nof Ray, and he became impressed with the belief that in arranging plants,\r\nthe resemblances of the most important parts and organs, should be\r\nconsidered before those of the less important. This manner of proceeding\r\nhe called the natural method. It was founded upon the knowledge of the\r\nanatomy of the plants and upon their physiology, and the method required\r\ncare and research. The artificial method of Linnæus enabled botanists to\r\ndistinguish plants readily, by examining the most readily examined, and\r\noften unimportant, parts of the plant’s flower. It was not a scientific\r\nplan, but a ready method. It did not bring one plant into relation with\r\nanother, showing the common method of growth and reproduction, but simply\r\nenabled one plant to be separated and distinguished from another, and\r\nthis is the least part of botany.\r\n\r\nThe works of Whewell on the inductive sciences, the article on botany in\r\nthe “Encyclopædia Britannica,” Pulteney’s “Life of Linnæus,” and that\r\nwritten by Miss Brightwell, of Norwich, and De Candolle’s “Mémoires et\r\nsouvenirs écrits par lui même” have been freely and largely quoted in\r\nthese chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHEROES OF ZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The nature of the science of zoology—Great zoologists usually\r\n    botanists also—Aristoteles as a zoologist—Plinius—The long age\r\n    of no progress—The life of Conrad Gesner—The zoology of Ray and\r\n    Willughby—Swammerdam—Réaumur—The zoology of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n\r\nZoology does for animals what botany does for plants. It is the science\r\nwhich treats of the resemblances and differences of animals, their\r\nshapes, and habits, and which explains their position on the earth in\r\ndifferent countries, and classifies them. It is inseparably linked on to\r\nthe study of comparative anatomy and to physiology which treats of the\r\ninternal structures and the influence which the outside world has upon\r\nthe living thing. Like botany, the science arose in a simple manner, and\r\nmen first of all learned to distinguish one animal from another, giving\r\nthem names. Then their habits were noticed, and some attempt was made to\r\narrange animals by their greater or less resemblances of external shape.\r\nThe age of the wonderful affected zoology as it did botany, and the\r\nintellectual darkness of the Middle Ages prevented progress. The writings\r\nof travellers, the discovery of the microscope, and civil and religious\r\nliberty, caused the rise of zoology, and the classifications gradually\r\nbegan to include the past or extinct kinds of animals with those which\r\nare now existing in a great scheme, which indicates the succession of\r\nliving things upon the earth.\r\n\r\nAs a great branch of natural history, it was to be expected that zoology\r\nwould be studied with botany; and in fact, nearly all the great botanists\r\nhave been able zoologists, whilst nearly every great zoologist began with\r\nbotany.\r\n\r\nAristoteles was as great a hero in zoology as he was in botany, and he\r\nmay be said to have founded the science. Certainly, some of the principal\r\ndivisions of the animal kingdom were taught by him. He was the first\r\nto make an attempt to explain the anatomy of animals, the functions or\r\nduties of different parts of their bodies, and to compare them with\r\nthose of man. He discussed their resemblances and differences with great\r\nacuteness. He was especially distinguished as a student of fishes, making\r\na vast number of observations of his own, and collecting those of other\r\nwriters. After much consideration, Aristoteles wrote upon the distinction\r\nbetween living things and inanimate nature, and we owe him the notion\r\nof the distinctions between the genus and the species. He wrote with\r\nregard to the species: “An animal species is an assemblage of individual\r\nanimals, in which not only the whole form of any one resembles the whole\r\nform of any other, but each part in any one resembles the corresponding\r\npart in any other. Thus, every horse not only resembles every ether horse\r\ngenerally, but the eye or the hoof of every horse resembles the eye or\r\nhoof of every other horse. They are, therefore, the same in the character\r\nof the individual parts.” “A genus is an assemblage of individuals in\r\nwhich any one bears, upon the whole, an obviously perceptible resemblance\r\nto any other. But the corresponding portion in the different species\r\nof the same genus, usually differ in colour, form, numbers, size, and\r\nproportion.” This is not so clear as the notion of the species, and he\r\nextended the term genus to what is now called an assemblage of genera,\r\nthat is to say, a family, order, or class. He clearly distinguished\r\nbetween white-blooded and red-blooded animals, and was aware of the\r\nmysterious connection between the existence of a spinal column, made up\r\nof bones, or vertebræ, and red blood. He makes vertebrated, or backboned,\r\nanimals to take the first place in his scale of classification.\r\nClassifying man, viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes,\r\ncetaceous animals (whales), and serpents amongst the red-blooded,\r\nAristoteles put down as white, or no blooded animals, insects, or\r\ncreatures divided into segments, cuttlefish, with soft substance, rather\r\nsoft-shelled animals, like lobsters, and hard-shelled creatures such as\r\noysters. He examined, one by one, all the species he could procure, and\r\nthen classed together as a subordinate generic group all those, which\r\nresembling each other in the more important parts of their structure,\r\ndiffered only in size or colour, or in other points of little importance.\r\n\r\nAristoteles founded the natural history of his age, and no one came near\r\nto him. He left nobody behind to follow his work.\r\n\r\nIn after years, Plinius wrote on beasts, fishes, birds, and insects,\r\nand on human and comparative anatomy, but he made no great advance on\r\nAristoteles. Then there occurred as great a gap in the study of zoology\r\nas happened in botany, and many hundreds of years elapsed before progress\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nConrad Gesner, a Swiss, made the first great step in zoology after the\r\nancients, and his life was a most remarkable one. A writer says of him,\r\nthat he was a shining example of the truth of the remark, that those who\r\nhave most to do, and are willing to work, find the most time. He was\r\na great scholar, and a profound naturalist. He began life in extreme\r\npoverty, soon became an orphan, laboured whilst ill, and sacrificed\r\nhimself for the sake of others. A son of a poor skinner and worker\r\nof hides, he was born in 1516, at Zurich, and had to suffer pinching\r\npoverty, with his numerous brothers and sisters. An uncle was kind to\r\nthe boy, and began to educate him, but death stepped in and he lost his\r\nkind relation. When only thirteen years of age, Gesner was cast upon the\r\nworld, his father having died fighting in the battle of Zug. The lad was\r\nseriously ill and dropsical, and his sole fortune was a little knowledge\r\nof classics, which he had picked up. Probably one of the professors\r\nat Zurich, Ammian by name, and who had instructed him, gave him\r\nintroductions, for we find the lad at Strasbourg when fifteen years of\r\nage. His thoughts were to go into the Lutheran Church, and it is certain\r\nthat the Lutheran Wolfgang Fabricius Capito gave him some employment,\r\nand enabled him to begin the study of Hebrew. Returning again to Zurich,\r\nthe university there gave him a little pension, to enable him to travel,\r\nand he went into France to Bourges. There he taught at a school, and\r\noccupied his spare time in learning Greek and Latin. Then he went to\r\nStrasbourg again, hoping for employment, and finding none, was asked to\r\nreturn to Zurich, and to teach in the university. At the age of twenty\r\nhe married, and, of course, much against the wishes of his friends,\r\nwho do not appear to have done anything for him, except to have given\r\ngratuitous advice. Although the Church was to be the career of Gesner,\r\nhe took much interest in the healing art, and resigning his position at\r\nZurich, he went, having a small pension, to Basle as a medical student.\r\nAnxious to know the wisdom of the Greek physicians, he paid unusual\r\nattention to that language, and edited an edition of a dictionary of it.\r\nThis study brought strange results, for he was offered a professorship\r\nof Greek at Lausanne, and he accepted the position. He was very young,\r\nand yet learned men found his friendship valuable. Going, subsequently,\r\nto Montpellier, he became acquainted with a naturalist named Rondelet,\r\nand he gradually began to earn enough money to be independent. So he\r\nreturned to Basle, and in 1541, being twenty-five years old, took his\r\ndegree in medicine. He settled in practice at Zurich, and occupied his\r\nspare time in studying zoology and botany, and soon became wealthy.\r\nOccasionally he travelled, and during one of these trips he became\r\nacquainted with the leading men at Venice and Augsburg, and at their\r\ninstance began a great work, a kind of universal catalogue of Greek,\r\nHebrew, and Latin works. All this time he was slowly and surely studying\r\nanimals and plants, and in 1551 the first part of his “History of\r\nAnimals” appeared, to be followed by others in 1554, 1555, and 1556. The\r\nvolumes contained descriptions of viviparous quadrupeds, that is to say,\r\nfour-footed beasts, whose young are born in active movement; of oviparous\r\nquadrupeds, or those which lay eggs; of birds and of fishes, and other\r\naquatic animals. He wrote also upon insects. All agree that this book\r\nis a miracle of industry, having for its object no less than a general\r\nhistory of animated nature. It contains a careful criticism of the works\r\nof previous authors, and, besides much valuable and solid knowledge on\r\nzoology, many interesting remarks on the habits and medicinal uses of\r\nanimals. He followed the method of Aristoteles, and the notion of the\r\ngenus was, of course, not satisfactorily established; but the book was\r\nthe source of much of modern zoology, from which succeeding writers drew\r\nlargely.\r\n\r\nGesner’s botanical works were as great as those relating to animals,\r\nand he designed and painted fifteen hundred figures of plants, which\r\nwere of great use to his successors. As if he had not enough to do, he\r\ntranslated the Greek works of Aelian, on animals, in 1556. Scientific\r\nand industrious, he had much to contend with, and was short-sighted. He\r\nwas the first person who used concaved glasses to remedy this defect in\r\nhis sight. As years rolled on, Gesner was much liked and honoured in\r\nhis native town; he was very amiable, a great peacemaker, and a liberal\r\ncitizen. He established a botanic garden, and gave employment to artists.\r\nWhilst in the full vigour of life, and in active practice as a physician,\r\nthe plague attacked Zurich, and Gesner successfully combated the\r\ncontagious disorder in many cases. He exposed himself without fear, after\r\nthe fashion of most medical men, and unfortunately caught the disease.\r\nWhen the worst symptoms came, he knew his hour was at hand, and asked to\r\nbe carried into his library and museum, where all the treasures he had\r\ncollected and described, to the delight of his students and friends, were\r\ndeposited. There he breathed his last, in the arms of his affectionate\r\nwife, for whose love contagion had no terrors. He died with the calmness\r\nof a Christian philosopher, on the fifth day of his attack, at the early\r\nage of forty-nine. His remains rest, much honoured, in the cloister of\r\nthe Greek church at Zurich. Not only did Gesner consolidate the knowledge\r\nof the animal and vegetable kingdom of his day, but he also influenced\r\nother authors to do good work, and to avoid unkind criticism. His calm,\r\ncandid, and equable temper enabled him to soothe the angry feelings of\r\nothers, under their real and imaginary wrongs. He laid aside his own\r\nlabour to assist others, and he devoted much time to the supervision and\r\npublication of a work which was left incomplete, by a deceased friend, so\r\nas to provide for the family.\r\n\r\nGesner’s life is a very good proof that where there is a will there\r\nis a way, and that poverty does not impede the path of a thoroughly\r\nindustrious and earnest man. The poor skinner’s son’s name is respected\r\nat the present day, and will be so, as long as science lasts.\r\n\r\nThe interesting life of Ray has already been given amongst those of\r\nthe heroes of botany; he was, however, a zoologist of the first class,\r\nand his devotion to that part of natural history was part of his great\r\nfriendship for Mr. Willughby. This promising young man studied under Ray,\r\nat Cambridge, and whilst the master took plants under his care and study,\r\nthe pupil began to work at animals. They made a tour together, visiting\r\nFrance, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries. Ichthyology, or\r\nthe study of fishes, and ornithology, or the study of birds, occupied\r\nthe attention of Willughby. Having collected a vast number of specimens\r\nand observations, they returned to England, and Willughby immediately\r\ncommenced working with a view to the publication of a great work on the\r\nanimal kingdom. He even contemplated a visit to America; but health\r\nfailed, and he died in the prime of life, on July 3rd, 1672. The\r\neducation of his two infant sons was confided to Mr. Ray, who was one of\r\nhis executors. Willughby thought his works too imperfect for publication,\r\nbut Ray felt otherwise, and urged it upon him for three reasons: first,\r\nthe glory of God; secondly, the assistance of others in the same\r\nstudies; thirdly, the honour of his native land. Upon these grounds he\r\ngave his consent, and Ray became their editor. A book on birds, “The\r\nOrnithologia,” was the result, and it contains a large amount of original\r\nobservation, and is a full and exact description of the habits and\r\nmaladies of birds, and the best means of domesticating them. Excellent\r\nanatomical descriptions are added. Subsequently, a book on the fishes of\r\nthe Mediterranean appeared.\r\n\r\nThe merits of Willughby as a natural historian still continue to be\r\nrecognized. He was a most accomplished zoologist, and he gave Ray\r\nand Linnæus the method of classification of animals which is usually\r\nassociated with their names. Ray acknowledged this, and he says that\r\nhe found among his friend’s manuscripts the histories of beasts and\r\ninsects, no less than of birds and fishes, “digested with a method of his\r\nown.” He was not a simple wealthy and intelligent amateur, for he was\r\nmaster to one of the greatest naturalists. Ray, in editing Willughby’s\r\n“Book on Birds,” gives a most touching preface to the memory of his\r\nfriend. He says, “He was from childhood addicted to study, and ever since\r\nhe came to the use of reason, so great a husbander of his time, as not\r\nwillingly to lose, or let slip unoccupied, the least fragment of it;\r\ndetesting no vice more than idleness, which he looked on as the parent\r\nand source of all others. Of his skill in natural philosophy, chiefly the\r\nhistory of animals, I shall say no more at present, but that it hath not\r\nyet been my hap to meet with any man, whether in England or beyond seas,\r\nof so general and comprehensive knowledge therein.”\r\n\r\nA very different career, but one which has had a greater general\r\ninfluence on natural history, was that of John Swammerdam, who was born\r\nat Amsterdam, in 1637, his father being an apothecary. His grandfather,\r\nJacob Dirkz, was born in the village of Swammerdam, near Leyden, and\r\nhis father, a well-to-do apothecary, lived there and took his name from\r\nthe village. He married Berendina Corvera and settled at Amsterdam. The\r\nfamily lived in comfort, and the little one was destined, like many\r\nother naturalists, to the Church. His education consisted of sound\r\nLatin and Greek, and when he became old enough, he began to feel that\r\nthere were responsibilities about his future office as a clergyman,\r\nwhich he did not think he could fulfil. Holland at that time was in a\r\nreligious ferment, and sects of all kinds existed, religion being more\r\ntalked about than practised. The lad, as he grew up, desired to follow\r\nin his father’s footsteps, and to learn the healing art; but his genius\r\nled him to the study of nature. Before he was fifteen years of age, he\r\nbegan to make collections of natural history objects, and whenever he\r\ncould get away from home, and spare time from his medical studies, he\r\npursued his favourite employment, searching the woods and fields, the\r\nsand-hills and muddy shores, the lakes, rivers, and canals, for insects,\r\nworms, and molluscs, until he acquired, even as a youth, a more extensive\r\nknowledge of the lower animals than all the naturalists who had preceded\r\nhim. In 1661 he went to Leyden and studied surgery and anatomy. In this\r\nlast he excelled, and became celebrated for his methods of preserving\r\ndissections. Then he went to Saumur, in France, and to Paris, where he\r\ngained the friendship of Thévenot the traveller, who was his patron\r\nsubsequently, and assisted him when in Amsterdam in after years, by\r\nobtaining permission for him to dissect human bodies. His fellow-pupil\r\nwas Nicholas Steno, of whom more will be said under the title of “Heroes\r\nof Geology.” On his return to Leyden, Swammerdam discovered the method\r\nof injecting arteries with coloured wax, and of keeping the internal\r\norgans in a dry condition for purposes of study, and investigated the\r\nnature of the lymphatics. He graduated soon after, and after receiving\r\nhis diploma, returned to his old love, nature, and occupied nearly all\r\nhis time in the anatomy and physiology of insects.\r\n\r\nSwammerdam worked so incessantly, that he got into bad health, and was\r\nobliged to relinquish the medical profession for a time. He followed up\r\nhis researches into the minute construction of insects, and really never\r\nceased them until death. The Grand Duke of Tuscany visited Amsterdam\r\nat this time, and examined Swammerdam’s collections. Greatly impressed\r\nwith their value, and with the splendid dissections, he offered a home\r\nto the young naturalist in his palace, and twelve thousand florins for\r\nthe collection. Swammerdam, however, did not care to wear a collar; and\r\nloving freedom of thought, which he did not think he would have in Italy,\r\ndeclined the offer. He knew that he would be expected to change his\r\nreligious tenets, and said that he would not sell his soul for money. He\r\npublished a “General History of Insects,” in 1669, and soon afterwards\r\nbroke down, entirely, in health, so that he had to go into the country\r\nto rest and do nothing. But this was impossible; and he began to study\r\nbees, and their natural history. Probably it was this constant weak\r\nhealth, and the solitude necessary for the peculiar nature of his work\r\nand observations, that had a very remarkable influence on the mind\r\nand emotions of this great investigator. Always religious, he longed\r\nmore and more for communion with his Maker and the author of all the\r\nwonders he was constantly studying. When in better health he was happy\r\nin his thoughts, and considered that it was his duty to study nature;\r\nbut when ill, from the effects of overwork, he began to think that his\r\nlabours were leading him astray, and that to seek the good opinion of his\r\nfellow-creatures and to become famous, was a sin. Sometimes he gave up\r\nscience, to begin again with fresh zeal, and then he would neglect it,\r\ngiving up his whole time to religion. Unfortunately he was unreasonable\r\nin his method of working. Boerhaave, the great physician, thus wrote of\r\nSwammerdam: “He laboured so assiduously at this work as to destroy his\r\nconstitution, nor did he ever recover a shadow of his former strength.\r\nThe labour, in fact, was beyond the power of ordinary men—all day he was\r\nemployed in examining objects, and at night described and delineated what\r\nhe had seen by day. At six in the morning, in summer, he began to receive\r\nsufficient light from the sun to enable him to trace the objects of his\r\nexamination. He continued dissecting until twelve, with his hat removed\r\nlest it should impede the light, and in the full blaze of the sun, the\r\nheat of which caused his head to be constantly covered with profuse\r\nperspiration. His eyes being constantly exposed to a strong light, the\r\neffect of which was increased by the microscope, they were so affected\r\nby it, that after midday he could no longer trace the minute bodies which\r\nhe examined, although he had then as bright a light as in the forenoon.”\r\n\r\nSwammerdam investigated the nature of the changes of outside form and\r\ninternal structure which accompany insect life. Some of his drawings of\r\nthe escape of the ephemera fly from its sheath of delicate skin on the\r\nsurface of the water, and out of the wingless or nymph condition, are\r\nvery beautiful. But his accuracy regarding the minute internal changes of\r\nthe tissues and organs in the larva, pupa, and perfect insect is being\r\nmore and more acknowledged. He taught that these changes were not sudden,\r\nbut that a continuous growth of organs and tissues culminated at certain\r\ntimes of the life of the insect. The larva, or caterpillar, admirably\r\nadapted for its course of life, was a stage of the life cycle of a more\r\nperfect form, the imago or flying insect. Swammerdam stated that all the\r\norgans of the perfect insect—a butterfly, for instance—were in a visible\r\nyet only slightly developed condition in the caterpillar. And late\r\nresearches are leading to prove that he was right, for the wings of the\r\nfuture fly are to be detected in the body of the tiny crawling thing that\r\nescapes from the egg.\r\n\r\nHappy in this toil when he was well, for it was all about what was\r\nentirely new and previously unknown, he often laboured on, when he was\r\nill, with “sighs and tears.” Naturally sensitive, pious, and very\r\namiable, he at one time quite gave up his work under the influence of a\r\nremarkable woman, Antoinette Bourignon. She was a wealthy, well-educated\r\nperson, extremely plain, and who believed that a mission had been given\r\nher to preach according to her own fancies, and not in accordance with\r\nthe general doctrines of the age. She seems to have stimulated Swammerdam\r\nto lead a purely religious life, and to give up his studies. It was the\r\nage of sects and of intolerance; and possibly the disagreeable reception\r\nwhich this certainly very good woman met with, made the man care more\r\nabout her peculiar tenets. He began, seriously, to try and sell his\r\ncollections, made catalogues of his possessions, and corresponded with\r\nAntoinette. While various negotiations were pending, Swammerdam published\r\nthe results of his ten years’ labour and the “Anatomy of the Day Fly,”\r\na great work, and his best. Then he went on a journey into Denmark to\r\nuse his influence with the king in order to get Antoinette a home in\r\nthat kingdom, the Lutherans of Holland having ordered her to leave their\r\ncountry. He was not successful; and probably this affair made a great\r\ncommotion at home. On Swammerdam’s return, his father, enraged at him for\r\nhis utter carelessness about earning money and his want of application\r\nto business, determined to allow him only a small sum of money to live\r\nupon. He was in utter despair, for this prevented his following his\r\nwish to lead, for the future, a life of meditation and religion. The\r\nfather died soon afterwards, and a lawsuit was commenced by the family to\r\nprevent Swammerdam having his share of the property. This trouble brought\r\non illness, and severe ague followed, and, although recovery took place,\r\nthe sensitive, able man sank soon afterwards. Swammerdam made an epoch\r\nin zoology by showing the value of the microscope, and by his extreme\r\nexactitude in descriptions, drawings, and dissections. His contributions\r\nto human anatomy alone will always render his name illustrious.\r\n\r\nAlthough everybody must regret that Swammerdam had not good means, and\r\nthat his work was so sadly brought to a close by poverty and trouble, yet\r\nit must be remembered that wealth is not a great incentive to distinction\r\nin subjects that require great self-denial, and which are not much valued\r\nby what is called public opinion. The temptations incident to, and the\r\nreal duties of wealth, are as great antagonists of successful scientific\r\nresearch, as poverty. And certainly the frivolity and vice of the\r\nwealthier classes of Europe, during the earlier part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, were not likely to inspire any of their members with a desire\r\nfor natural science. But some very remarkable instances occurred, in\r\nwhich the genius and determination of some great men prevailed over the\r\nintolerance and habits of the age, and enabled them to become men of\r\ngreat mark in zoology and other subjects.\r\n\r\nThe first to be noticed is René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, who was\r\nborn at Rochelle, in western France, in 1683. Well born, and having\r\nwealthy parents, he was well educated, and destined for the law. He did\r\nnot follow the propensities of the age, but began to study the arts and\r\nmanufactures of France with great care, and to spend his spare time in\r\nnatural history researches. From what is known of his career, it is\r\nvery evident that he had learned chemistry and mineralogy, and that\r\nhis education had been a most careful and liberal one. His fortune was\r\nconsiderable, and it not being necessary for him to work for his bread,\r\nhe determined to follow the bent of his inclinations. When twenty years\r\nof age, Réaumur went to Paris, and his first essay was in the form of\r\nsome geometrical work which was read before the Academy of Sciences. At\r\nthe early age of twenty-four he was admitted a member of that learned\r\nand somewhat emotional body, and was a very constant contributor to its\r\npublications for fifty years. At first his desire was to improve the arts\r\nand manufactures of his native land, and in 1711 he made experiments upon\r\nthe manufacture of ropes, and he showed that the strength of a cord is\r\nless than the sum of the strength of the threads of which it consists,\r\nwhence it follows that the less a rope is twisted after a certain point,\r\nthe stronger it is. In 1715 he began to study the process of colouring\r\nartificial pearls, and probably it was during these researches that\r\nhis attention was attracted towards natural history. He found out the\r\nnature of the substance which gives the pearly lustre to fish scales,\r\nand then he investigated the growth of scales. Following up his subject,\r\nhe examined into the method of growth of the shells of molluscs. In one\r\nof his journeys in Languedoc, he discovered some substances resembling\r\nturquoise in colour, and they were used as gems; but he pushed the\r\nmatter further, and discovered a very remarkable fact. The extinct\r\nanimal called mastodon, from the peculiar teat-shaped projections on\r\nits huge teeth, roamed over Europe in the last geological age, and its\r\nteeth, covered with a very strong enamel, have been preserved in strata,\r\nor in fissures. Under the influence of the chemical action going on in\r\nrocks, the enamel becomes occasionally coloured, so as to resemble a\r\nturquoise-coloured porcelain. This was evident to Réaumur, who wrote\r\nupon the fact. Other studies took him away from natural history for a\r\nwhile, but they certify to the energy and hard work of the man and his\r\ngreat accuracy. Réaumur’s experiments in the manufacture of iron and\r\nsteel were of great importance, and it was an attempt to get the art of\r\nmaking steel introduced into France, that urged him on. He made good\r\nuse of his knowledge, for on publishing his methods of work, the Regent\r\ngave him a pension of 12,000 livres a year. Next he discovered the art\r\nof tinning iron, and whilst experimenting, Réaumur first noticed that\r\nmany metallic substances in passing from the heated fluid condition\r\nto the cold state, have a tendency to assume particular geometrical\r\nor crystalline forms. Among his useful discoveries were plans for\r\nthe manufacture of porcelain, and they were of great use to France. A\r\nthermometer, with a scale of temperature, still largely used in some\r\nparts of the world, was invented by him, and he took the freezing and\r\nboiling points of water as fixed points, and divided the interval into\r\neighty degrees. The present centigrade thermometer used in France is\r\nmade on the same plan, but the interval is divided into one hundred\r\ndegrees. Labouring as a physicist, still all this time Réaumur was\r\ndoing wonderful work in zoology. He described the means by which many\r\nechinodermata—sea-urchins and sea-stars—execute their movements, and\r\ndiscovered the curious manner in which many crustacea, such as crabs\r\nand lobsters, throw off their limbs and repair them. But his real and\r\nlasting work was on insects, which occupied all his best and later years.\r\nLiving in perfect quietude, without any great worries, sometimes at his\r\nestate at Saurlonge, and at other times at Bercy, near Paris, he worked\r\non, giving all his energies to his subject. His labours, he stated,\r\nwere published with a view to assist future investigators, and most of\r\nthem were original. He kept up his pretty country house and garden, and\r\nobserved the insects and their habits, and especially their methods\r\nof changing form. He followed Swammerdam in these investigations, and\r\nalthough there are some differences of opinion between the two great\r\nmen, still they both made their mark in the investigation of that part\r\nof natural history which deals with the progressive development of\r\nthe minute young to the full-grown creature. Réaumur was sufficiently\r\nwealthy to form a large collection of animals, and a very able man, M.\r\nBrisson, was employed by him as its curator, and was allowed to describe\r\nthe quadrupeds and birds. Réaumur did not care so much about classifying\r\ninsects, as describing their habits and anatomy; but his six great\r\nvolumes are still most valuable memorials of his conscientious care. He\r\nsays that the number of observations necessary for a tolerably complete\r\nhistory of so many minute animals is prodigious. When one reflects on all\r\nthat an accomplished botanist ought to know, it is enough to frighten\r\nhim. His memory is loaded with the names of twelve or thirteen thousand\r\nplants, and he is expected to recall, on occasion, the image of any\r\none of them. There is perhaps not one of those plants but has insects\r\npeculiar to itself; and some trees, such as the oak, give sustenance to\r\nseveral hundred different species. And after all, how many are there that\r\ndo not live on plants? How many species that devour others? How many that\r\nlive at the expense of other animals? How many species are there, some of\r\nwhich pass the greater part of their time in water, while others pass it\r\nentirely there? The immensity of nature’s works is nowhere more apparent\r\nthan in the prodigious multitudes of these little animals. This being\r\nthe case, he deems it impossible for any one man to acquire a knowledge\r\nof all the insects of even a limited district; therefore, instead of\r\nburthening the memory with the characteristic distinctions of these\r\ncreatures, to the neglect of matters of greater importance, he recommends\r\nattention to particular _genera_, and especially to those which are of\r\nmost frequent occurrence, that a knowledge of their peculiarities, food,\r\nand propagation, and the different forms they assume, may be accurately\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn the first two volumes, Réaumur treats of caterpillars, their changes\r\nof form into the chrysalis, and this into the butterfly; about their\r\ndifferent kinds and habits, and concerning the other insects which attack\r\nthem, and live within them, in their early stage.\r\n\r\nThe third volume includes the description of the habits of the clothes\r\nmoths, and the plant-lice, or aphides; the fourth treats of gall insects\r\nand two-winged flies; the fifth contains the history of bees, and the\r\nsixth of wasps and hornets. The natural history of the grasshoppers,\r\ncrickets, and beetles was to have been written in a seventh volume, but\r\nit was never completed. The published volumes contain much very valuable\r\ninformation, and their great merit consists in the wonderful care\r\nRéaumur took, in investigating facts and in recording them carefully and\r\nsystematically. He especially studied the instincts of insects, and thus\r\nbrought their nervous system into prominent notice, and also the evident\r\nconnection between the surrounding conditions and the peculiar lives of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nYears rolled on and the worthy man became old, but still persisted\r\nin his simplicity of life and desire for study. He was so superior in\r\nintellect to the class to which he belonged, that he lived free from\r\njealousy and intrigue. Probably few men have led a happier life than\r\nRéaumur, and certainly his useful works will last as long as mankind. At\r\nthe age of seventy-four he met with an accident whilst riding, and died\r\nOctober 18th, 1757. He had no personal vanity, and, being influenced by\r\nthe true scientific spirit, sought truth and not personal distinction and\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nLinnæus, whose life has been given under the title of a hero in botanical\r\nscience, was almost as great a zoologist as botanist and mineralogist.\r\nHis classification of animals produced as great a change in the direction\r\nand possibility of studying zoology, as that of plants did in the case of\r\nbotany. It led the way, through an artificial system, by which animals\r\ncould be readily known, to a natural system which united animals not only\r\nby their common general shape, but also by the nature, position, and\r\nuse of their internal organs. His system of naming animals was equal to\r\nthat of plants, and the reasonable generic and the applicable specific\r\nnames, going together, stamped the animal with a kind of individuality.\r\nClassification, description, and proper naming were the important parts\r\nof Linnæus’s zoology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE LIVES OF BUFFON, PENNANT, AND LAMARCK.\r\n\r\n    The popular writings of Buffon, and his life—Pennant’s\r\n    life—Lamarck and his life—The rise of popular natural history,\r\n    and of exact descriptions and philosophical zoology.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf natural history had never been studied in an easy manner, and had\r\nnot the results of those studies been given to educated men desirous\r\nof knowing something about animals in popular yet correct works, very\r\nfew men would have cared to become zoologists. It is the good, easy,\r\npopular, but not necessarily jocular book on natural history that, as a\r\nrule, excites the attention of the young, and stimulates the youth to\r\nobtain further knowledge. Such books were written at a very interesting\r\ntime of the world, and just when they were wanted; and the writer was\r\na very remarkable man—a man born to wealth and station, but who, like\r\nmany others, preferred hard work and the study of nature to sloth and\r\nluxurious idleness, and even to the profession of arms, so much in vogue\r\nin the early part of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nGeorge Louis Leclerc de Buffon was born on September 7th, 1707, at\r\nMontbard, in Burgundy. He came of good family, and his father was\r\ncouncillor of the Burgundian parliament. His mother, Anne Christine\r\nMazlin, appears to have possessed considerable natural gifts. She was\r\nalso of good family, and was remarkable, in those days, for the elevation\r\nof her mind and strength of character. She was a better parent than the\r\nfather who, although he was looked upon as a wonder in his province,\r\nin consequence of his wasteful living and devotion to feasts, balls,\r\nand concerts, was really only a person of average merit. The mother was\r\ntenderly loved by her son, but the father gave him some trouble in after\r\nyears, on account of his follies. Nevertheless, it adds to the interest\r\nand good example of Buffon’s character to learn that he did not care to\r\nfollow the agreeable life of his father, but that he broke away from it\r\nand took to wisdom, although having great property, he always lived and\r\nbehaved like a nobleman of wealth and mental distinction.\r\n\r\nBuffon was the oldest of five children, and the rest were devoted by the\r\nparents to the priesthood, or to nunneries; so it would appear that the\r\nfather not only followed the rule of the day, to keep the property in the\r\nhands of the eldest son, but to provide for the others in the cheapest\r\npossible manner. The young noble was in due course sent to a school at\r\nDijon kept by Jesuit fathers, the best instructors in those days; and\r\nreport says that the boy was fond of arithmetic and had a character\r\nfor decision and perseverance. After a while Buffon was entered at the\r\nacademy of Angers, it being decided that the boy should follow his\r\nfather as a magistrate and public man. There his love of study became\r\nevident, and his application was considerable. One of his associates was\r\na young English nobleman, Lord Kingston, and they became great friends,\r\nand probably this friendship was caused and fostered by his lordship’s\r\nGerman tutor, Hinckman, who was a man of considerable learning. When he\r\nwas nineteen years of age the three friends started for a tour in Italy.\r\nReturning to Angers to resume his studies, Buffon became a little wild,\r\nand got into a quarrel with a young Englishman at play. Buffon wounded\r\nhis antagonist and had to leave the town. He went to Paris, but not to\r\nwaste time; on the contrary, his former love of figures, and his later\r\nstudies in mathematics, inspired him to translate Newton’s “Fluxions”\r\ninto French, and also Hale’s “Vegetable Statics,” which subsequently he\r\npresented to the Academy of Sciences. Still keeping up his friendship\r\nwith Lord Kingston, Buffon visited Italy again; and there is no doubt\r\nthat Hinckman instilled the love of nature into the young man’s mind.\r\nThey were all at Rome in 1732, when Buffon heard of the death of his\r\nmother, who was greatly mourned by him. He was then twenty-five years of\r\nage, and became very wealthy, as he was his mother’s heir. Journeying in\r\nSwitzerland he began to know other English people of distinction. All\r\nthese friendships led him at last to England, and he went to Thoresby,\r\nthe seat of Lord Kingston, and remained in the country for some months.\r\n\r\nBuffon had a very fine person, liked a little “show,” and the rather\r\nsolemn and stilted manners of the British nobility pleased him. It was\r\nthis stay in England, and his friendships, that gave Buffon some of the\r\nmanners of the aristocracy of the day, so that Hume said of him that he\r\nresembled a marshal of France more than a man of letters. These habits,\r\namongst which courtesy and true gentility—that is to say, treating other\r\npeople as we would they should treat us in society—were predominant,\r\nclung to Buffon; and even when at home, and at his very hard and\r\nincessant labour in natural history, he kept up his state, and was the\r\ngreat French noble as well as the humble student of nature.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, but one very readily explained, that Buffon, like\r\nnearly all the great zoologists, began his scientific life as a botanist.\r\nPlants are ever at hand, and their classification, good or bad, is\r\nreadily learned. One of his first works, presented after receiving the\r\nhonour of election to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, was on a question\r\nof the influence of barking trees; and others were on agriculture. He\r\ngave a proof that he was acquainted with the human frame, for he wrote on\r\nthe causes of squinting.\r\n\r\nScientific men of nobility were rare in France in those days, and Buffon\r\nwas appointed keeper to the Jardin du Roi and the Royal Museum. Anxious\r\nto continue his studies about trees, he prevailed on the king to let him\r\nexperiment on a grand scale in one of the royal forests. But this was\r\nonly a part of his work, for he commenced that great book on natural\r\nhistory which was always after to be associated with his name. It was\r\nnot to be a simple book on animals, but on the history of the earth as\r\nwell; and, in fact, he intended it to be an encyclopædia of all natural\r\nknowledge except mathematics and figures. It was a great conception and\r\nit was carried out year after year during success, domestic happiness and\r\ntrouble. The perseverance and patience of the man were wonderful; and\r\nfortunately he had the means of collecting what was required, of buying\r\nbooks and of having secretaries to do the very troublesome and mechanical\r\npart of writing. He was short-sighted and wrote badly. It was not vanity,\r\nnor the desire of being great, that made Buffon work; certainly it was\r\nnot amusement. But he was happy in his work, and he stated that genius is\r\na gift which comes not from man; and the great man is an instrument in\r\nthe Divine hand; he has a mission which may be for light or to ruin, and\r\nneither the environment of pleasure or glory or the troubles of fortune,\r\nill-health, or misery should deter him from his ends. Genius, Buffon also\r\ntermed, a very great aptitude for patience.\r\n\r\nDaubenton assisted Buffon in his first three volumes of natural history,\r\nand they came out in 1749, and the other volumes came out year by year\r\nuntil his death.\r\n\r\nBuffon lived carefully, and kept up the curious state of the French\r\ngentlemen of his day in his house. After he was dressed, he dictated\r\nletters and regulated his domestic affairs, and at six o’clock he retired\r\nto his studies in a building called the tower of St. Louis. This was\r\nin the garden, and far away from the house, and the only furniture in\r\nit was a wooden writing-table, with its cupboards and drawers, and an\r\narmchair. Neither pictures nor books relieved the naked appearance of\r\nthe apartment, or distracted the thoughts of the learned professor.\r\nThe entrance was by green folding doors, the walls were painted green,\r\nand the interior had the appearance of a chapel in consequence of the\r\nelevation of the roof. Within this garden was another building, where\r\nBuffon resided during the greater part of the year, as it was warmer than\r\nthe other place, and here he composed most of his works. It was a small\r\nsquare building, situated on the side of a terrace, and was ornamented\r\nwith drawings of birds and beasts. At nine o’clock Buffon usually took an\r\nhour’s rest and his breakfast, which consisted of a piece of bread and\r\ntwo glasses of wine. When he had written for two hours after breakfast,\r\nhe returned to the house. At dinner he spent a considerable time in\r\nconversation, and relaxed his mind from work entirely, enjoying the wit\r\nand gaiety of his friends. He usually slept for an hour after dinner in\r\nhis room and took a solitary walk, and during the rest of the evening\r\nhe either conversed with his family or his guests, or sat at his desk\r\nexamining papers which were submitted to his judgment. At nine o’clock\r\nhe went to bed. In 1762, when fifty-five years of age, Buffon married\r\na lady who was in every way suited to him, and who, moreover, took a\r\ndeep interest in his studies. He was greatly attached to her, and her\r\ncompanionship made the country life all the more pleasant. Four years\r\nafterwards Louis XIV. ennobled Buffon and invited him to Fontainebleau to\r\noffer him the post of Administrator of the Forests of France, but Buffon\r\ndeclined the office. This great man was not above a little vanity: he\r\nliked to read the most interesting parts of his works to his friends,\r\nand to draw forth their admiration. He was, moreover, fond of dress and\r\ngrandeur, but that was part of the society of his day. He had a fine\r\ncountenance and figure, and it was his delight to display them to the\r\nbest advantage. He dressed in the extreme of fashion, and amidst his\r\nstudies found time to submit his head (perhaps it was only his wig) to\r\nthe hairdresser, two or three times a day. On Sundays the peasantry of\r\nMontbard assembled to gaze at the Count after the service of the church,\r\nwhen he passed through their ranks magnificently dressed, with his son\r\nand his retainers.\r\n\r\nThe natural history was translated into English, German, Italian,\r\nSpanish, and Dutch, and its charming pages brought a knowledge of nature\r\nto many a home. Like most naturalists of eminence, Buffon interested\r\nhimself about the ancient history of the earth. His writings were not\r\noriginal in that part of his subject, but what he did write contained\r\nmuch common sense. Nevertheless, the Faculty of Theology at Paris found\r\nfault with the geology, and informed him that no less than fourteen\r\npropositions in his works were reprehensible and contrary to the creed of\r\nthe Church. Buffon was invited to recant, which he very foolishly did;\r\nand it must be mentioned that the “improper statements” are now believed\r\nin, by every educated man. It has been written of the great naturalists\r\nof the past, that Aristoteles has shown the profound combination of the\r\nlaws of nature, Plinius her inexhaustible riches, Linnæus her wonderful\r\ndetails, and Buffon her majesty and power. Certainly his great work\r\ncontains such pictures of nature as were never given before, and rarely\r\nsince, by any naturalist. Buffon therefore had the happiness of bringing\r\nthe cultivation of the science more generally into fashion than it had\r\nbeen previously. He was deficient in the orderly method of science,\r\nhowever; his work, supremely interesting and popular, was soon found to\r\nbe inconsistent with the severely scientific study of nature. This want\r\nof order and classification led to the establishment of a new school of\r\nzoology.\r\n\r\nBuffon’s social position was of great value and importance to him as a\r\nnaturalist and to the state also, for he became the object of personal\r\nregard to many distinguished foreign princes, who did not hesitate\r\nto make presents of specimens to the national museums, through him.\r\nHis wealth also enabled him to help the state, for he often purchased\r\nminerals and specimens of animals for which no public money had been\r\ngranted. Frederick the Great of Prussia and his son Henry, the Emperor\r\nJoseph II. of Austria, Catherine of Russia, and the kings of Norway and\r\nSweden, all knew Buffon, admired his works, and sent presents in order to\r\ncomplete his museum, which was devoted and given by him to the public.\r\nThe Jardin du Roi was greatly enlarged at Buffon’s expense, and public\r\nopinion spoke well of the amiable and benevolent owner of Montbard.\r\n\r\nBut, as with other and less happily placed men, Buffon had to suffer,\r\nand the loss of his child, followed by the death of the wife he tenderly\r\nloved, in the prime of her life, were great shocks to him. He never was\r\nthe same man afterwards, and sought to find forgetfulness in increased\r\nwork and literary toil. Moreover, the ingratitude of the ruling power\r\naffected Buffon, who behaved, however, excellently, and took up the\r\nposition which every man of his social condition should have maintained.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1771, Buffon was alarmingly ill, and, unknown to him, the\r\nking, Louis XV., nominated a Count d’Angiviller, to succeed in the\r\nadministration of the Museums and Jardin de Roi. Buffon recovered, and\r\nfound out this little job, and was naturally annoyed at the indecent\r\nhaste of putting a man in his place at such a crisis; but he was most\r\nindignant when he knew who the man was—an ignoramus and court favourite,\r\na perfectly incompetent man. It is said that Louis XV. on this occasion,\r\nto compensate Buffon for his annoyance, raised the Montbard property to\r\nthe holding of a count. Certainly he ordered the sculptor, Pajon, to\r\nerect a full-sized statue of Buffon in the garden during his absence, and\r\nto put the inflated inscription on it, “His genius equals the majesty of\r\nnature.” Buffon resented this, and he wrote to the President de Ruffey:\r\n“I thank you for the part you have taken in procuring this statue, which\r\nI neither required nor solicited, and which would have done me greater\r\nhonour if it had been erected after my death. I have always thought that\r\na wise man should rather fear envy then value glory; all this has been\r\ndone without consulting me.”\r\n\r\nSome years afterwards an architect, who was employed in embellishing\r\nsome of the buildings in the Jardin du Roi, wished to compliment Buffon,\r\nbut this simple-minded, scientific man stated, “I cannot agree to any\r\nexpenditure which will contribute to my personal glory, and I had nothing\r\nto do with the statue they erected to me.” In writing to Madame Necker,\r\nhe showed how exactly he understood the French court, and appreciated its\r\npraises: “I passed the whole of yesterday and the day before in making\r\nobservations and notes on a most important project presented to the king,\r\nrelating to the planting of 100,000 fir trees for the masts of the navy.\r\nI would not grudge the time if my advice were likely to be useful and\r\nvalued and taken; but in the high circle where you have not cared about\r\nremaining, they do sometimes consult competent men, and end, invariably,\r\nby following the advice of the ignorant.”\r\n\r\nBuffon lived for many years after these troubles, and gained fresh\r\nlaurels. Those which will last the longest were the results of his\r\ncharming descriptions of the habits of animals. At last, at the age of\r\neighty-one years, he died, full of honours, his last words addressed to\r\nhis son being, “My son, never leave the path of virtue and honour; it is\r\nthe true road to happiness.”\r\n\r\nAbout a year before the death of George I., a son was born to a family\r\nof good old name and renown at Downing, in Flintshire. The child was\r\nchristened Thomas, and his other name was Pennant, and these names are\r\nconstantly coming before naturalists who particularly study zoology at\r\nthe present time. Little is known about the early years of this ardent\r\nstudent, except that he was educated at Wrexham school. Like most boys\r\nhe took notice of birds and their habits, and if one may judge from the\r\nresults, he must have really begun to study the different kinds of birds,\r\ncarefully, when he was about twelve years of age. He owed his opening\r\ncareer as a zoologist to Ray and Willughby, for it was a present made to\r\nhim of the book of birds of this last author, that drew his attention to\r\nthe study of nature which he never subsequently neglected.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving school, Pennant was sent to Oxford, where his studies do\r\nnot appear to have been of any importance, so far as the subjects which\r\nwere taught were concerned. He did not take his degree, and yet it is\r\nevident that he studied the nature of things visible to him, and that he\r\nwas well read in the science of the day. His mind was rather influenced\r\nby the writings of Linnæus, and in consequence he took an interest in\r\nmineralogy as well as about natural history. Immediately after leaving\r\nOxford, Pennant began to travel about his own country, and visited\r\nCornwall. He examined many of the mines, and studied the natural history\r\nof the districts, but he did not publish anything, being apparently an\r\nearnest student of what was already known. When twenty-four years of\r\nage an earthquake occurred at Downing, and Pennant wrote a description\r\nof it, which was read before the Royal Society and published in the\r\n“Philosophical Transactions.” This was a great honour for so young a man.\r\nAnimals, however, and their shapes, habits, and similarities were his\r\nspecial study, and he laboured hard, year after year, in describing them.\r\nHe got much practical knowledge of those of our own country, and finally,\r\nat the age of thirty-five, in 1761, he commenced the publication of his\r\nfirst great work, the “British Zoology,” which was printed in large\r\nfolio, and when complete contained one hundred and thirty-two plates. He\r\nwas well known before this magnificent work appeared, and Linnæus had\r\nurged the University of Upsala to elect him a member of their Royal\r\nSociety. His great book appeared afterwards in smaller editions, and one\r\nin quarto is often used.\r\n\r\nThe “British Zoology” included the description of the species of animals\r\nat that time known to inhabit Great Britain, except the insects. So\r\ngood was the work and so accurate were the descriptions, that it was\r\ntranslated into Latin and German, and had a large circulation abroad.\r\nAnxious to compare his work with those of foreign naturalists, and to\r\nsee the specimens of similar animals in the great continental museums,\r\nPennant travelled abroad in 1765, and made the acquaintance of the most\r\nimportant zoologists of the day. He visited Buffon at Montbard, and their\r\nfriendship led to a correspondence, which lasted for years. Then he went\r\non to Switzerland, and met Haller at Berne. Coming home by way of Germany\r\nand Holland, he met a distinguished traveller and naturalist, Pallas\r\nby name. Pennant wrote about him: “Our conversation related chiefly to\r\nnatural history, and as we were both enthusiastic admirers of our great\r\nRay, I proposed his undertaking a history of quadrupeds on the system\r\nof our countryman, a little reformed. He assented to my plan, and wrote\r\nme a long letter in which he sent me an outline of his design, and his\r\nresolution to pursue it with all the expedition consistent with his\r\nother engagements.” Pallas went to Russia, and never accomplished his\r\nobject, but Pennant followed out the idea himself, and in 1771 published\r\na work with the title of “A Synopsis of Quadrupeds,” illustrated with\r\nabout thirty plates. This was intended as a kind of index to the species\r\nof animals described by Buffon in his great work on natural history.\r\nHe gradually, however, extended its limits, and included in it the\r\ndescription of many animals which he had observed in collections or which\r\nhad been discovered by travellers, and which had been unknown to Buffon.\r\nYears afterwards the great Cuvier said of this work, “that it is still\r\nindispensable to those who wish to study the history of quadrupeds.”\r\n\r\nStruck with the interesting nature of the animals of India, which were\r\nthen beginning to be studied, Pennant commenced a work about them, and\r\ntwelve plates were completed. But it was a work far beyond the powers\r\nand pocket of a naturalist of that date, and it was not completed. A\r\nmore congenial work was undertaken by him when he rambled about Scotland\r\nnoticing the habits of the people and the birds. He seems to have\r\nobserved much that was interesting, and to have published his remarks.\r\nThen he began a work on the genera of birds, on the plan of his books\r\non quadrupeds, and this was not completed. He wrote a book on “Arctic\r\nZoology,” which was of course a compilation from the works of travellers\r\nand foreign zoologists who had visited the countries within the arctic\r\ncircle. He also received stuffed specimens from different foreign\r\nmuseums. It was a capital book, and it acquired a considerable reputation\r\namongst naturalists, from its containing figures and descriptions of\r\nanimals hitherto but little known. It is read at the present day, and is\r\na proof of Pennant’s exactitude. Ever anxious to go on working, he even\r\nin his sixty-seventh year planned an extensive work which was to consider\r\nthe natural history and antiquities of every country in the world. He\r\nabsolutely did produce two great volumes of this work, taking Hindostan\r\nas his subject.\r\n\r\nThe great merit of Pennant was that he observed so much and was a capital\r\npractical zoologist. Moreover, his great knowledge of other things and\r\nhis general accomplishments enabled him to sift the good from the bad\r\nzoology of his day. He appears to have lived the life of a student and\r\nnaturalist when the kingdom was always in a whirlwind of politics, and\r\nwhen foreign troubles prevailed. Unlike most of his class, for he was a\r\nlittle country squire, living on his own estate at Downing, he devoted\r\nhimself to nature, and for many years his books gave great enjoyment\r\nto thousands of his countrymen. They are most readable books, full of\r\nanecdotes, and it is evident that he was a master of his mother tongue,\r\na great antiquary, besides a naturalist of the first order. He was one\r\nof the few men who followed the science of zoology without having the\r\nprevious education of a medical man, and, like all good zoologists, he\r\nwas an excellent botanist.\r\n\r\nSome of Pennant’s tours through England, Wales, and Scotland are\r\nexceedingly instructive in the antiquities of places, but the most\r\ninteresting remarks are upon natural history subjects, some of which are\r\nscientific and others not at all so. When in Lincolnshire he noticed the\r\nfens near Revesby Abbey, eight miles beyond Horncastle, which he says\r\nare of vast extent, but serve for little other purpose than the rearing\r\nof great numbers of geese, which are the wealth of the fenmen. “During\r\nthe breeding season these birds are lodged in the same houses with the\r\ninhabitants and even in their very bed-chambers. In every apartment\r\nthere are three rows of coarse wicker pens, placed one above another;\r\neach bird has its separate lodge divided from the other, which it keeps\r\npossession of during its time of setting. A person called a gozzard\r\nattends the flock, and twice a day drives the whole to water; then brings\r\nthem back to their habitations, helping those that live in the upper\r\nstories to their nests, without even misplacing a single bird. The geese\r\nare plucked five times in the year. The first plucking is at Lady Day,\r\nfor feathers and quills, and the same is renewed, for feathers only, four\r\ntimes between this and Michaelmas. The old geese submit very quietly to\r\nthe operation, but the young ones are very noisy and unruly. I once saw\r\nthis performed, and observed that the goslings of six weeks old were not\r\nspared, for their tails were plucked, as I was told to habituate them\r\nearly to what they were to come to. If the season proves cold, numbers of\r\ngeese die from this barbarous custom. Vast numbers are driven annually\r\nto London to supply the markets; among them all the superannuated geese\r\nand ganders (here called cagmags) which serve to fatigue the jaws of the\r\ngood citizens who are so unfortunate as to meet with them.” He proceeds,\r\n“It is observable that once in seven or eight years, immense shoals of\r\nsticklebacks appear in the Welland below Spalding, and attempt coming\r\nup the river in a vast column. They are supposed to be the collected\r\nmultitudes washed out of the fens by the floods of several years, and\r\ncarried into some deep hole. When, overcharged with numbers, they are\r\nobliged to attempt a change of place, they move up the river in such\r\nquantities as to enable a man who was employed in taking them, to earn,\r\nfor a considerable time, four shillings a day by selling them at a\r\nhalfpenny per bushel. They were used to manure land, and attempts have\r\nbeen made to get oil from them.” “The birds which inhabit the different\r\nfens are very numerous; I never met with a finer field for the zoologist\r\nto range in. Besides the common wild duck, wild geese, gorganies,\r\npochards, shovellers, and teals breed here. I have seen in the east fen\r\na small flock of the tufted ducks; but they seemed only to make it a\r\nbaiting place. The pewits, gulls, and black terns abound; the last in\r\nvast flocks almost deafen one with their clamour, and a few of the great\r\nterns are seen amongst them. I saw several of the great crested grebes\r\non the east fen, called there gaunts, and met with one of their floating\r\nnests with eggs in it. The lesser crested grebe, the black and dusky\r\ngrebe, and the little grebe are also inhabitants of the fens, together\r\nwith the coots, water-hens, spotted water-hens, water-rails, ruffs,\r\nredshanks, lapwings or wipes, red crested godwits and whimbrels.” “But\r\nthe greatest curiosity in those parts is the vast heronry at Cressi Hall,\r\nsix miles from Spalding. The herons resort there in February to repair\r\ntheir nests, settle there in the spring to breed, and quit the place\r\nduring the winter. They are as numerous as rooks, and their nests are so\r\ncrowded together that myself and the company that was with me, counted\r\nnot less than eighty on one spreading oak. I found that the crested heron\r\nwas only the male of the other, and it made a most beautiful appearance\r\nwith its snowy neck and long crest streaming with the wind.” Visiting\r\nScarborough, and giving much information about the different kinds of\r\nfish caught, he states: “At a distance of four or five leagues from\r\nshore, during the months of July and August, it is remarked that at the\r\ndepth of six or seven fathoms from the surface, the water appears to be\r\nsaturated like a thick jelly, filled with the ova of fish, which reaches\r\nten or twelve fathoms deeper; this is known by its adhering to the ropes,\r\nthe cables, and anchor when they are fishing.” “Landing at a small island\r\nfurther north, we found the female eider ducks at that time sitting; the\r\nlower part of their nests was made of sea plants, the upper part was\r\nformed of the down which they pulled off their own breasts, in which the\r\neggs were surrounded and warmly bedded. In some nests were three and\r\nin others five eggs of large size and pale olive colour, as smooth and\r\nglossy as if varnished over. The nests are built on the beach among the\r\nloose pebbles, not far from the water. The ducks sit very close, nor will\r\nthey rise until you almost tread upon them. We robbed the nests of some\r\ndown, and found that the down of one only weighs three quarters of an\r\nounce, but was so elastic as to fill the crown of a hat.”\r\n\r\nPennant deserved good health and had it, for, except when old age came\r\non, he was a singularly healthy man. He died in 1798, at the age of\r\nseventy-two years.\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste Antoine de Monet, also called the Chevalier de Lamarck,\r\nwas born at Bazantin, a village of Picardy, on April 1st, 1744. He was\r\nthe eleventh child of Pierre de Monet, the principal person of the\r\nneighbourhood, whose small estate was disproportionate to his huge\r\nfamily. But the Church was a resource for such families, and occasionally\r\nits great prizes were taken by the younger members of noble houses. So\r\nM. de Monet determined to prepare his son, at an early age, for this\r\nhopeful future, and sent him to the Jesuit College at Amiens. However,\r\nthe inclinations of the child were not those which made it probable that\r\nhe would succeed in the direction which his father had chosen for him.\r\nEverything around the boy, at home, was quite opposed to a clerical\r\ncareer. For centuries his ancestors had carried arms, and his eldest\r\nbrother was killed at the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom. Two brothers were in\r\nthe army, and at that time France was in dire trouble, and required every\r\nman who could fight, it was therefore not probable that young Lamarck\r\nwould stay at home. Nevertheless, his father resisted his desire to enter\r\nthe army, and the young man had to study year after year, until he was\r\nsixteen years of age. Then in 1760 the father died, and the youth was\r\nleft to his own resources. He set forth for the army, mounted on a sorry\r\nhorse, and accompanied by a poor boy out of the village, to journey\r\nacross France into Germany to join the French army. He had a letter of\r\nintroduction from one of his neighbours, Madame Lameth, to M. de Lartié,\r\ncolonel of the regiment of Beaujolais, who did not receive him very\r\ngladly, for the wretchedness of the boy made him look more helpless than\r\nhe really was. Nevertheless, he sent Lamarck to his barracks and had him\r\nto do duty. It was at a most critical moment that the brave, self-reliant\r\nboy joined the army. It was about July 14th, 1761, and M. de Broglie had\r\njust united his force with that of the Prince du Sorbise, preparatory to\r\nattacking, on the next day, the allied army, commanded by Frederick of\r\nBrunswick. At break of day M. de Lartié inspected his regiment, and the\r\nfirst person he saw was the newly-arrived volunteer, who, without orders,\r\nhad placed himself in the first rank of the grenadier company. The\r\nbattle, which was fought at Fissingshausen, between Ham and Leppstadt,\r\nwas lost by the French, and during the fight, the company, in which was\r\nM. de Lamarck, was placed in a locality on which the whole of the allied\r\nartillery was concentrated, and it was forgotten to be moved during the\r\nconfusion of the retreat. All the officers and sub-officers were killed,\r\nand only sixteen men remained, when the oldest grenadier, seeing that\r\nthey were left behind by their army, proposed to the young volunteer\r\nthat they should retreat. Lamarck said, “They have posted us here, and\r\nwe ought not to move until we are relieved,” and insisted on remaining.\r\nBy-and-by the colonel, missing the company, sent them an order to retreat\r\nby safe ways, and under the shelter of what they could get. This act of\r\ngreat courage was told to the Marshal de Broglie, and he made Lamarck an\r\nofficer on the spot. Then he was made lieutenant. But such a brilliant\r\ncommencement was not to have a military termination, and a miserable\r\naccident gave a new direction to his life. When Lamarck, after the war,\r\nwas in garrison at Monaco, one of his fellow-officers lifted him up by\r\nthe head, and the result was to injure his neck. He nearly died from\r\nthe effects of this folly, and was saved by a distinguished surgeon at\r\nParis, M. Tenon, whose operation left Lamarck with life, and a fearfully\r\nscarred neck, and unable to follow his profession. The treatment occupied\r\na whole year, and he was so poor, that one of his biographers states,\r\nrather cruelly, that his necessary solitude gave him plenty of time for\r\nmeditation. It is remarkable that although Lamarck cared more for the\r\narmy than for his studies at college he really worked there, and what\r\nhe learned was of great use to him in his future career. His hours of\r\nweary suffering were sometimes employed in studying the clouds, and in\r\nnoticing their different shapes and appearances. He got by this means\r\nsome vague ideas of meteorology. He had already been attracted, during\r\nhis stay at Monaco, by the curious vegetation of that rocky country, and\r\nlad taken a fancy for botany from reading a treatise on common plants,\r\nwhich happened to fall in his way. He therefore began to see that the\r\nprofession of arms was not the only one worth living for, or in which\r\ndistinction might be earned; and he took the bold resolution of applying\r\nhimself to the study of medicine. This, considering the smallness of\r\nhis resources, was hardly less hazardous than his former determination\r\nto join the army. Unable to defray the expense attending the studies\r\nto which he now applied himself, he was forced to seek employment as a\r\nbanker’s clerk, and thus to work for the means of pursuing his purpose.\r\nHe studied medicine four years, and at the end of that time, not finding\r\nit accord with his taste, he relinquished it, in order to attach\r\nhimself the more closely to botany. In this science he laboured most\r\nperseveringly, and after a preparation of ten years he suddenly revealed\r\nhimself and his views to the learned world in a work as remarkable for\r\nthe novelty of the plan, as for the mode of execution. “For a long time,”\r\nsays Cuvier, “while collecting plants, and visiting the Jardin du Roi,\r\nLamarck gave way to discussions with other botanists on the imperfections\r\nof all the systems of classification then known, and on the ease with\r\nwhich a new system might be created, capable of determining plants with\r\ngreater quickness and certainty. Wishing to prove what he had so often\r\naffirmed he set to work, and after six months of incessant labour he\r\nproduced his “Flore Française.” This work was merely an epitome of plants\r\nindigenous to France, to which Lamarck had not ventured to add one new\r\nspecies; but it was a convenient and sure guide to the name of every\r\nplant, and was peculiarly acceptable at a time when the writings of\r\nRousseau had rendered botany popular. By Lamarck’s arrangement, the most\r\neasily reconciled portions of the systems then in vogue, namely, those\r\nof Tournefort, Linnæus, and Jussieu, were selected to form a new method\r\nof classification. This method was admired by the Academy of Sciences,\r\nand was also recommended by Buffon, who had sufficient interest to get it\r\npublished at the expense of the government, for the benefit of the author\r\nwho much needed such aid. Lamarck was promoted to a vacant place in the\r\nAcadémie des Sciences, and during 1781-82 he went as tutor and botanist\r\nto Buffon’s son through Holland, Germany, and Hungary, visiting public\r\nestablishments and learned men. On his return to France, he applied\r\nhimself zealously to his former studies, and produced the botanical\r\nportion of the “Encyclopédie Methodique.” Lamarck laboured diligently at\r\nhis work, and even with too much precipitation, for haste was injurious\r\nto correctness. He also drew a series of plates to illustrate the\r\ndifferent genera of plants. These appeared, arranged according to the\r\nLinnæan system, though contrary to the wish of the author. Lamarck went\r\non with the work until the breaking out of the Revolution arrested the\r\npublication of the Encyclopédie.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 Lamarck was associated with Daubenton as botanist of the Cabinet\r\ndu Jardin du Roi, and charged with the preservation and arrangement\r\nof the herbariums. Here, amidst his peaceful occupations and studies,\r\nhe remained unmolested amidst all the troubles of the Revolution. But\r\nLamarck was miserably poor; his pension for his services in the army,\r\nwas less than one shilling a day, and he wrote for bad pay. Buffon\r\ncould not give him a position worth anything; and it was not until the\r\nsuccessor of that great man came in office that Lamarck had a little\r\nsalary given to him as one of the assistants in the herbarium. Even\r\nthis miserable appointment was not assured to him, for the National\r\nAssembly was desirous of suppressing the establishment, and finally did\r\nso. Lamarck had married, and had a family, and weary indeed must have\r\nbeen his life had he not been devoted to science. He took no part in the\r\nFrench revolution, and whilst poverty at home and danger out of doors\r\nwere constant, he persisted in studying nature. Years passed away, and\r\nthe best part of a life was spent, and still Lamarck was not a zoologist.\r\nThe eternal fame which he attained began to be earned after the fiftieth\r\nyear of his age, when circumstances over which he had no control gave him\r\nthe opportunity of distinguishing himself, and of adding materially to\r\nthe truths of science as well as to its theories. The Jardin et Cabinet\r\ndu Roi were rearranged in their purpose and name in 1793, and were called\r\nthe Museum of Natural History; and all the old officials were made\r\nprofessors, and had to teach the subjects best known or chosen by them.\r\nLamarck, as the last comer, had to take what the others left and would\r\nnot undertake to teach. It was the professorship which related to the\r\nclass of animals, called by Linnæus, worms and insects, and which had\r\nhitherto been almost overlooked, on account of the supposed unimportance\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nUntil that time Lamarck had never studied animals, and of course knew\r\nnothing of the branch of zoology which was now entrusted to him. He\r\nhad taken an interest in shells, and had made a small collection, but\r\nthis was all. But he did not shrink from the task before him. He set to\r\nwork with inexhaustible courage, availing himself of the advice of his\r\nfriends, and applying to the new study all that sagacity and perseverance\r\nwhich had already been so invaluable to him in his botanical works. By\r\nhis indefatigable zeal in this new sphere of inquiry Lamarck was soon\r\nenabled to discover and to demonstrate that the animals whose history\r\nhad been left to him through contempt, were quite as interesting as\r\nothers, if not more so, on account of their vast numbers, the important\r\npart they perform in nature, the infinite variety of their forms, and\r\nthe wonders of their organization. His extraordinary labours in this\r\ndepartment have contributed much more to his fame than his botanical\r\nwritings, and are certainly more valuable. He seems to have exercised his\r\nabilities to the utmost in these researches; and if, since that time, it\r\nhas been necessary in some instances to alter, to amend, or to extend\r\nthe limits of his work, yet it remains a lasting memento of his talents,\r\nand it will be long ere any one will be found sufficiently profound in\r\nknowledge to undertake a general revision and alteration of his works.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, when any student begins to learn the zoology of\r\nthe lower animals, he will find a very great number of genera with the\r\nname of Lamarck placed after them, indicating that he first of all\r\ndescribed and published them. As the student becomes accomplished he\r\nwill appreciate Lamarck more and more, and will come to the conclusion\r\nthat no one has done such good and solid work as that distinguished\r\nFrenchman, amongst the vast assemblage of animals which he first of all\r\ncalled invertebrata, or animals without backbones. This term he used\r\nin preference to the old one of white or colourless-blooded animals,\r\nas he soon saw that some had red blood. Lamarck worked very hard in\r\ndescribing and grouping the genera, and gradually modified the zoology\r\nof those lower forms of life. First of all he classified them by their\r\nanatomy, and then, after about fifteen years’ labour, remodelled his\r\nclassification, and published a system of invertebrata, containing\r\nthe classes, orders, and genera of the animals, mentioning their most\r\nimportant anatomical characters. In this book he, for the first time\r\namongst zoologists, began with the most simple and least highly organized\r\nanimals, the converse having been the method previously. There was a\r\nreason in this that will be noticed further on. Out of the confusion\r\nof old he made the great groups appear clear and well defined. Thus\r\nfrom amongst the insects he separated the crustacea or crab tribe, and\r\nhe introduced that of the arachnida or spiders. Then he described and\r\nlimited a class of worms called by him annelida; moreover, he placed the\r\nmicroscopic infusoria in a class by themselves, and removed them from the\r\njumble of the polypes. His work extended into the mollusca, both bivalve\r\nand univalve; he named many genera and species of corals, and in every\r\ngroup showed a master mind. The fossil shells found in such abundance at\r\nthis time, in the neighbourhood of Paris, attracted his attention, and\r\nhe laboured on their description and explanation. In fact, the enormous\r\nlabours of Lamarck consolidated the zoology of the lower animals, and\r\nhis writings became the text-books of all his successors, and will be\r\nreferred to, as long as science lasts. He had a most singular capacity\r\nfor distinguishing animals into kinds or species, and a more important\r\none of observing the alliances or common characters of different species.\r\nAll his descriptive work was of a standard and solid nature. His great\r\nwork appeared from 1815 to 1822, and it was founded on that just\r\nmentioned; some of it was edited by his daughter, and M. Latreille wrote\r\nthe parts on insects, and much of those of the mollusca was due to M.\r\nValenciennes. Five volumes were by Lamarck himself.\r\n\r\nIt is a very unusual occurrence for a man to take up a new subject after\r\nhe is fifty years of age, and to become a master in it. But Lamarck did\r\nthis. It is true that his previous training as a botanist had prepared\r\nhim, and it is also true that his years of solitude and poverty had given\r\nhim a singularly placid and meditative mind, and this was strengthened\r\nby his natural courage. Had Lamarck been a descriptive zoologist only,\r\nhe would have been great; but the very method which made him great\r\noriginated in some remarkable speculations which had hardly been\r\nexpressed, seriously, by any man before. Not only did he place the animal\r\nkingdom with the lowest first, but he considered the will, instinct, and\r\napparent reason of animals, and classified them accordingly with those\r\nwhich are apathetic, sensible, and intelligent. The idea of lowness of\r\norganization or of structure and lowness of nervous power amongst the\r\nsimplest animals struck him to be of primary importance. Hitherto, quite\r\nas many people believed that the highest and most intelligent animals\r\nwere created first, and that the lower ones had degenerated from them.\r\nLamarck conceived that nature, acting by law, commenced with the simplest\r\nthings, and that one species formed others, so that the present animals\r\nand plants are the outcome of those of the past history of the earth. He\r\nbelieved in incessant change in nature, and that when our knowledge is\r\ncomplete the apparently well separated and defined species will be found\r\nto be united by intermediate forms, and cease to be species.\r\n\r\nHitherto naturalists had considered kinds of animals and plants, or\r\nspecies as they are more properly called, to have been specially created\r\nas they are seen by us, and that they were unalterable and invariable. No\r\none with any great knowledge of animals and plants had speculated about\r\nthe origin of species, and the causes of the differences of kinds, or\r\nhad endeavoured to place all the great classes of the animal kingdom in\r\na series, maintaining that they were related by descent. Right or wrong\r\nin his speculations, Lamarck made an epoch in zoology, by writing on\r\nthe philosophy of zoology, and dealing with the possible causes of the\r\ndifferent kinds of animals. He considered that during all the geological\r\nages, down to the present time, animals and plants had been exposed to\r\ngreat changes in their external conditions; changes of climate, and of\r\nphysical geography had happened, and that whilst some species had become\r\nextinct many had been changed, little by little, into others. Lamarck,\r\nand M. Geoffrey St. Hilaire declared it to be their opinion that there\r\nhad been an uninterrupted succession in the animal kingdom, effected by\r\nmeans of birth and offspring from parents, from the earliest ages of the\r\nworld to the present day, and that the ancient animals, whose remains\r\nhave been preserved in strata, however different, may nevertheless have\r\nbeen the ancestors of those now in being.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will turn to the short notice of Aristoteles, he will\r\nfind the ordinary idea of what a species means given. But Lamarck added\r\nsomething: “A species consists of a collection of individuals resembling\r\neach other, and reproducing their like by generation, so long as the\r\nsurrounding conditions do not alter to such an extent as to cause their\r\nhabits, characters, and forms to vary.” He stated what is only known to\r\nthose naturalists who have had experience; the more we advance in the\r\nknowledge of the different organized bodies which cover the surface of\r\nthe globe, the more our embarrassment increases to determine what ought\r\nto be regarded as a species, and still more how to limit and distinguish\r\ngenera. In proportion as our collections are enriched, we see almost\r\nevery void filled up, and all our lines of separation effaced; we are\r\nreduced to arbitrary determinations, and are sometimes fain to seize upon\r\nthe slight differences of mere varieties in order to form characters\r\nfor what we choose to call a species, and sometimes we are induced\r\nto pronounce individuals, but slightly differing, and which others\r\nregard as true species, to be varieties. The greater the abundance of\r\nnatural objects assembled together, the more do we discover proofs that\r\neverything passes by invariable shades into something else; that even the\r\nmore remarkable differences are evanescent, and that nature has, for the\r\nmost part, left us nothing at our disposal for establishing distinctions\r\nsave trifling, and in some instances puerile, peculiarities. We find\r\nthat many genera amongst animals and plants are of such an extent, in\r\nconsequence of the number of species referred to them, that the study\r\nand determination of these last has become almost impracticable. From\r\na great number of facts we learn, wrote Lamarck, that in proportion as\r\nthe individuals of one of our known species change their situation,\r\nclimate, and manner of living, they change also little by little, the\r\nconsistence and proportions of their parts, their form, their faculties,\r\nand even their organization, in such a manner that everything in them\r\ncomes at last to participate in the mutations to which they have been\r\nexposed. Even in the same climate, a great difference of situation and\r\nexposure causes individuals to vary; but if these individuals continue to\r\nlive, and to be reproduced under the same difference of circumstances,\r\ndistinctions are brought about in them which become in some degree\r\nessential to their existence; and, in a word, at the end of many\r\nsuccessive generations, these individuals which originally belonged to\r\nanother species are transformed into a new and distinct species.\r\n\r\nAll this came from the study of a man who had an enormous experience, and\r\nif he had not gone on any further it would have been better. Lamarck’s\r\nviews already stated may be accepted by everybody, and the grand changes\r\nin living forms under law are doubtless true. But he introduced the\r\nnotion that “wants” exercised an influence and produced new organs,\r\nand wrote about effects of internal sentiment, and the influence of\r\nsubtle fluids. Thus he argued that otters, beavers, waterfowl, turtles,\r\nand frogs, were not made web-footed in order that they might swim; but\r\ntheir wants having attracted them to the water in search of prey, they\r\nstretched out the toes of their feet to strike the water and move more\r\nrapidly along its surface. By the repeated stretching of their toes,\r\nthe skin that united them at the base acquired the habit of extension,\r\nuntil, in the course of time, the broad membranes which now connect their\r\nextremities were formed.\r\n\r\nLamarck taught that the first animals and plants which appeared on the\r\nglobe were the simplest, and that the more complex are of comparatively\r\nlate date. He insisted that nature was an order of things constituted by\r\nthe Supreme Being, and subject to laws which are the expressions of His\r\nwill. There is no doubt that these views of Lamarck were the result of\r\nmany a pleasant hour of thought when things were dark enough around him.\r\nHe was always poor, he married four times, had a large family, and a very\r\nsmall income. His genius led him to investigate other branches of natural\r\nscience for which his education had not very well prepared him, and he\r\ngot into disgrace with Napoleon for paying attention to meteorology.\r\nHis patrimony and savings were lost in some wild speculation, and his\r\nthorough independence of thought and behaviour did not make him friends\r\nwith the great and wealthy. His sight failed, and age grew apace, and\r\nhe may be said to have simply existed for some years. Strangers and\r\nscientific men saw his state and poverty with surprise and regret;\r\nand their sympathy with Lamarck was redoubled when they observed the\r\nfortitude with which the illustrious old man supported the vicissitudes\r\nof fortune, and the failing of his natural powers. They also admired the\r\ndevotion with which he had been able to inspire those of his children\r\nwho remained under his roof. His eldest daughter consecrated her time to\r\nthe duties of filial love for many years, never quitting her father for\r\nan instant, lending herself to every study which could in any way supply\r\nthe defect of his vision, writing under his dictation part of his last\r\nworks, accompanying him, and supporting him when he was able to take any\r\nexercise, and enduring sacrifices greater than could be expressed for his\r\nsake. When the father could no longer leave his chamber, the daughter\r\nno longer quitted the house. So long was she deprived of fresh air,\r\nthat when she again faced the open breeze it was more than she could\r\nbear. If such conduct as this is rare, so is the power of inspiring such\r\ndevoted affection; therefore we add to the renown of Lamarck, when it is\r\ntold what his children endured for his sake. Lamarck died on the 18th\r\nDecember, 1829, aged eighty-five, and left two sons and two daughters\r\nbehind him. Full of ability and perseverance, he has left such monuments\r\nof industry and solid learning behind him, that his favourite theory,\r\ncontaining indeed the germs of truth, may be well pardoned. People who\r\nknow nothing of his good work, laugh at his memory; but every true\r\nstudent of nature constantly recognizes his obligations to the founder of\r\nphilosophical zoology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF CUVIER.\r\n\r\n    The union of zoology and comparative anatomy, and the\r\n    examination and study of fossil remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Léopold Chretien Fréderic Dagobert Cuvier was born at Montbéliard,\r\nin the Department du Doubs, a town which was subsequently united to\r\nFrance, although at the time of Cuvier’s birth it belonged to the kingdom\r\nof Wurtemberg. He was born on August 23rd, 1769. His family originally\r\ncame from a village in the Jura mountains, which still bears the name\r\nof Cuvier; but, becoming the victims of religious persecution, they\r\nwere obliged to leave and to go to reside at Montbéliard at the time\r\nof the Reformation. Cuvier’s grandfather had two sons, one celebrated\r\nfor his learning, and the other belonging to a Swiss regiment in the\r\nFrench service. The soldier, after forty years’ service, retired on a\r\nsmall pension to Montbéliard, where he was appointed commandant of\r\nthe artillery of the town. He was made Chevalier de l’Ordre Merite\r\nMilitaire, which, among Protestants, was equal to the Catholic order of\r\nthe Croix de St. Louis. The old soldier married, late in life, a young\r\nand highly accomplished lady, by whom he had three sons. The eldest\r\ndied a short time before the birth of the second, who is the subject of\r\nthis biography, and who was extremely delicate. The mother, sad at the\r\ndeath of her firstborn, took the curious fancy of calling her little\r\nweak second child by the name of George, which was that of her firstborn\r\nalso. Cuvier was not baptized with that name, although he ever used it\r\nin deference to his mother; but in after years, when legal difficulties\r\npresented themselves, he took the necessary measures to have a right\r\nto use the name. Feeble in constitution, the child required all the\r\nattention of his mother, and he never forgot her loving care. She taught\r\nhim carefully and well during his early years, and the child grew strong\r\nand able. He could read fluently at the age of four years, and when\r\nthe time came for him to be placed at school, the mother went over his\r\nexercises at night, and by her good knowledge of Latin enabled him to be\r\nbetter prepared than any other boy in the school, for his daily tasks.\r\nShe taught him drawing, and this necessary art was subsequently taught\r\nCuvier by an architect in the town. At the age of ten years he was placed\r\nat a school of a higher description of teaching, called the Gymnase,\r\nwhere he remained until he was fourteen. Cuvier made rapid progress\r\nat this school, and he was constantly at the head of his classes, and\r\nhe became a fair classic. It was at that time that the future great\r\nzoologist began to like natural history, and he began by studying\r\nanimals. One of his relations had a complete copy of Buffon’s works,\r\nand the boy’s study of it was constant. He copied the plates of animals\r\nand birds, and coloured them according to the printed descriptions, and\r\nwhen he could not use water-colours, employed pieces of coloured silk\r\nto denote the tints of the wings. When he was able to borrow the book,\r\na volume was his constant attendant, and he read the work over and\r\nover again. About this time, Cuvier, being the leading spirit in the\r\nschool, began to collect his schoolfellows and to get them to discuss\r\nthe merits of books on natural history, philosophy, and travels, etc.,\r\ntaking the chair as president. The assembly must have been amusing in the\r\nextreme, and these little “prigs” doubtless expressed their opinions very\r\ndecidedly. Cuvier managed to teach himself to speak in public, however,\r\nand was not a bad hand at declamation. So, on the anniversary fête of the\r\nDuke of Wurtemberg, he composed an oration in verse on the prosperous\r\nstate of the principality, and delivered it, fresh from his pen, in\r\na manly tone which astonished the audience. Nevertheless, Cuvier was\r\nsnubbed by his master, who put him down to the third place, giving the\r\npalm to two other boys. It is said that there was some favouritism in\r\nthis affair; but it was a blow to the boy, whose future career depended\r\non the place he might take at the school on the occasion. Nevertheless,\r\nas things turned out, Cuvier had every reason to be very thankful. The\r\nfame of the young student, and his disappointment, reached the ears of\r\nDuke Charles by means of the princess, his sister-in-law, and when he\r\nvisited Montbéliard he saw Cuvier, and asked him questions and looked\r\nat his drawings. The duke, satisfied that he had a good subject before\r\nhim, agreed to send him to Stuttgart to the university, where the youth\r\nwould be well educated, free of expense, in the duke’s own academy. At\r\nthis academy the pupils were instructed in every branch of knowledge that\r\nwas actually useful to men destined to govern and direct the affairs\r\nof communities, and many who were educated there, became members of\r\nthe various courts of Germany and Russia. The school had a military\r\ncharacter, the scholars wearing uniforms and being under the orders of a\r\ncolonel and major; but the education was not military, and such men as\r\nSchiller were taught there.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen Cuvier quitted his home to go to this school, and\r\nunder circumstances enough to frighten any schoolboy. He travelled with\r\nthe chamberlain and secretary of the duke, sitting between them without\r\nunderstanding a word they said, as they spoke German the whole time.\r\nHe always remembered this journey and its miseries. The youth quickly\r\nmade himself comfortable at the academy, and his really good training\r\nsoon placed him high amongst his fellows. For four years he studied all\r\nthat was taught in the higher classes, mathematics, law, administration,\r\ntactics, and commerce, and obtaining various prizes, was made, with five\r\nor six others out of the four hundred, to belong to a class bearing the\r\norder of “Chevalerie.” These youths were under the immediate patronage\r\nof the duke, and had privileges besides that of dining at a separate\r\ntable. Nine months after his arrival at Stuttgart, Cuvier gained the\r\nprize in German. But all this time Cuvier led a second life. Out in the\r\nfields and in the museum he was supremely happy. Collecting, observing,\r\ndrawing, and describing were his occupations in his leisure hours, and\r\nhis drawings of birds, insects, and plants were very excellent and\r\ncorrect. All the books he could get on natural history he read, and the\r\nworks of Linnæus were especially learned with zeal. At the end of his\r\nacademical career Cuvier was promised a place in the administration of\r\nthe country, and if he had got it probably he would have become a kind\r\nof civil service clerk, and have never been heard of. But trouble came,\r\nand that of the bitterest kind for a rising young man. Circumstances\r\nagainst which he could not bear up necessitated his seeking a totally\r\ndifferent kind of employment. The unsettled state of money and finance\r\nin France caused Cuvier’s father’s pension to be withheld, and the young\r\nman, very properly desiring to be no burthen to his parents, gave up\r\nall hopes of political distinction, and accepted the modest position of\r\ntutor to a French family, that of M. d’Hericy, at Caen, in Normandy. He\r\nwas to educate the only son; and so, without bewailing his lot, which was\r\nthought a very sad one by his companions and admirers, Cuvier settled\r\ndown to work and found that he was in the very position for using those\r\nremarkable powers as a naturalist, which determined his future career.\r\nThe sea was close by, and Cuvier began to study the marine animals. After\r\nsome time some fossils were discovered at Fécamp, and Cuvier began to\r\ncompare them with the living things which most resembled them. Then the\r\naccidental discovery of a calamary led him to study the higher mollusca,\r\nor shell-fish. Cuvier also began to study the huge class of vermes, or\r\nworms, in which Linnæus had included a vast number of lower animals, and\r\nwhich Lamarck subsequently investigated. Cuvier examined the anatomy\r\nof the groups, and arranged them according to their resemblances in\r\nstructure. This was an excellent piece of work, and it was done for\r\nthe purposes of self-instruction, and not for fame. Nevertheless, the\r\nmanuscript was full of good observations and of new truths. Whilst\r\nCuvier was thus employed, and the time was that of the reign of\r\nterror, a society was formed at Valmont, in his neighbourhood, for the\r\nencouragement of agriculture. L’Abbé Teissier had sought at the place a\r\nrefuge from the persecutions of the revolutionists of Paris, and under\r\nthe disguise of a surgeon attended the meetings. On one occasion Cuvier\r\nwas struck with the manner of speaking of the worthy old man, and thought\r\nthat it resembled the writings of the well-known Abbé. Inadvertently\r\nCuvier addressed him as L’Abbé, and this gave at first great alarm. He\r\nfound in Cuvier, however, a great admirer and a generous friend, and was\r\nso pleased with his talents and industry, that he afterwards wrote to the\r\ncelebrated botanist, Jussieu, as follows: “At the sight of this young\r\nman, I experienced the delight of the philosopher who was thrown on an\r\nunknown shore, and saw traced there the figures of geometry. M. Cuvier\r\nis a violet which was concealed among common herbs. He knows much, and\r\ndraws figures for your work. I doubt your finding a more able person for\r\ncomparative anatomy, for he demonstrates with much method and clearness.\r\nIt is a pearl worthy of being gathered by you. I contributed to draw M.\r\nDelarbre from his retreat, help me to draw M. Cuvier from his; he is made\r\nfor science and the world.”\r\n\r\nCuvier was, in consequence, asked to read some of his essays to the\r\nSociety of Natural History at Paris, and these gave such satisfaction\r\nthat he was invited to take a position at the Jardin des Plantes. This\r\noccurred in 1795, and Cuvier was then twenty-six years of age. He was\r\nthus settled for life in the very position he desired, for although\r\ncalled the garden of plants, a grand museum of the comparative anatomy\r\nof animals was to rise there under the superintendence of the young man.\r\nHe was soon made professor at the central school of the Pantheon, and\r\nbegan to write capital manuals of his subject for the students. The next\r\nyear the National Institute was formed, and Cuvier was one of its first\r\nmembers. At this time his knowledge of zoology was very great, and he had\r\nmore than the usual amount of information about the internal anatomy of\r\nthe different great groups of animals. He published an elementary title\r\nor scheme of the natural history of animals, and gradually the collection\r\nof skeletons began to be great in his establishment. Cuvier paid great\r\nattention to the relative shapes, and different developments of the same\r\nkind of bones in various animals, and especially to the nature of their\r\nteeth. So great did his experience and correct knowledge become, that he\r\nrarely failed in naming an animal from part of its skeleton. This power\r\nimpressed Cuvier with the idea of a philosophy in nature, and with the\r\nevidence of creative design and purpose, of means for ends. But this kind\r\nof study led to some very remarkable results. Had it influenced Cuvier\r\nas it previously had zoologists, he would have still become the most\r\naccomplished and important naturalist of this century. It would have been\r\nsaid, as it may well be, that he established the study of animals on a\r\nfirm basis, and that his natural classification has lasted, because he\r\nconsidered not only the outsides of animals, but also the importance of\r\ntheir most peculiar organs, in arranging them into groups, or separating\r\nthem from others. But Cuvier had seen and studied the bones and skulls of\r\nanimals which had been dug out of the earth in a mineralized condition.\r\nThe strata at Montmartre, near Paris, had yielded a great number of\r\nbones, which presented some resemblances to those of animals still living\r\nbut which were clearly not the bones of any existing genera or species.\r\nComparative anatomy was made to connect the past and present animals,\r\nand to indicate the possibility of all the past and present creation\r\nbeing placed in one great classification. As Cuvier progressed in this\r\nstudy, he endeavoured to restore, and with considerable success, the\r\nextinct animal’s shape, to discover its habits and method of life, and to\r\nfind out its nearest modern ally. Palæontology, or the study of extinct\r\nanimals, is under the greatest obligations to this great Frenchman, and\r\nit may be called the zoology of the past ages of the earth. He did not,\r\nhowever, forget his one great desire, which was to form a perfect book\r\non comparative anatomy, and one in which all animals would find a place,\r\ncalled “La Règne Animal.” (The animal kingdom.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cuvier found himself well established as assistant to M.\r\nMertrud, the professor of comparative anatomy to the Jardin des Plantes,\r\nhe sent for his old father, then eighty years of age, and for his\r\nbrother, M. F. Cuvier, to live with him. The first thing he did was\r\nto collect all the available specimens of bones and preparations of\r\nanimals, and he found many hidden away in vaults and which had been\r\ncollected by Daubenton and Buffon. Other specimens were obtained, and\r\nthus the great collection was commenced. In 1796, Cuvier discovered\r\nthe curious fact that there is naturally red blood in leeches, and in\r\nthe following year he read a famous paper on the nutrition of insects.\r\nRefusing to go to Egypt, as he had his proper work to do at home, for\r\nhis pupils Dumeril and Duvernoy were working hard for and with him,\r\ndissecting and describing, the result was the publication of the first\r\nvolume of the lessons on comparative anatomy already alluded to. This\r\nled to Cuvier being made professor of natural history to the College\r\nof France. Of the young professor’s ability there could be no doubt,\r\nand everybody was struck with the excellent method of his lectures and\r\nbooks. His mind was essentially an orderly and very contemplative and\r\nreasoning one, and his fame soon reached the ears of Napoleon, then first\r\nconsul. He made Cuvier one of the six inspectors general of education\r\nwho were to found public schools in some thirty towns in France and what\r\nare now called Royal Colleges. Cuvier founded those of Bordeaux, Nice,\r\nand Marseilles. In this last-mentioned place he continued his work on\r\nmarine animals. Whilst Cuvier was performing these very important duties\r\nfor the state, with great benefit to the towns and credit to himself,\r\nhe was chosen to be one of the perpetual secretaries to the National\r\nInstitute, and had a salary given to him for it of two hundred guineas\r\na year. Although this sum was to be well earned, and the secretary had\r\nto receive distinguished foreigners at table, a fuss was made about it.\r\nCuvier, however, knew his own value, and insisted on retaining it. The\r\nlabourer is worthy of his hire, and the sum was less than the salary\r\nof a first-class clerk. A great Italian politician once said keep the\r\nprofessors poor. Why? Because he knew that the diffusion of liberal\r\nknowledge would be fatal to civil and military tyranny. However, Cuvier\r\ngave up his school inspectorship and laboured on at his favourite\r\nstudies. He lost his father and his brother’s wife died leaving a child,\r\nso that Cuvier and his brother were alone. Marriage became a necessity\r\nfor the rising man, and he was attracted by a lady of great merit, who\r\nhad suffered both poverty and misfortune. Madame Duvancel was the widow\r\nof an official who perished on the scaffold in 1794, and she had some\r\nchildren of her own. Cuvier had a great affection for her and she made\r\nhim happy, was a great companion, and when he rose to his greatness,\r\nshe was an admirable helpmate. In 1808, as secretary to the National\r\nInstitute, Cuvier had to write a report on the progress of the natural\r\nsciences from the year 1789. A mere report was required, but Cuvier was\r\ntoo thorough, and his essay was an admirable and most lucid treatise.\r\nNapoleon, then emperor, was greatly struck with it, and presented\r\nthe paper to the council of state. Some of the sentences should be\r\nwritten in letters of gold in every senate and learned by heart by all\r\npoliticians. “The true object of science is to lead the mind of man\r\ntowards its noble destination—a knowledge of truth—to spread sound and\r\nuseful ideas among the lowest classes of the people, to draw human\r\nbeings from the effects of prejudices and passions, to make reason the\r\narbitrator and supreme guide of public opinion.” Napoleon, who nearly\r\nalways chose the best men for a place, made Cuvier a counsellor of the\r\nnew Imperial University, and the two men thus came frequently in contact.\r\nRepeated personal interviews preceded Cuvier’s appointment to organize\r\nnew universities in the foreign states more or less under the sway of\r\nFrance. He undertook the reorganization of the old Italian universities\r\nof Piedmont, Genoa, and Tuscany. His reports of these missions speak of\r\nthe enlightenment of his mind and his truly reasonable and very liberal\r\nspirit. Speaking of the universities of Tuscany, he deprecates a too\r\nhasty and rash interference with institutions which had been founded and\r\nmaintained by so many distinguished men of old and in which he found so\r\nmuch to praise and to retain. He made good use of his time in Tuscany by\r\ntaking drawings of and collecting fossil bones, and in 1811 his great\r\nwork on the fossil remains of animals appeared. He examined into the\r\ncondition of the universities of Holland, and finally those of lower\r\nGermany. These journeys were doubly useful, for they established his\r\nhealth and gave him plenty of opportunity of visiting museums. While at\r\nHamburg, Napoleon gave him the title of chevalier, which was confirmed\r\nto him and his heirs. But such honours were not destined to descend,\r\nfor Cuvier lost his son in his seventh year. It was a great grief, and\r\nit saddened and subdued the man. This trial happened when Cuvier was at\r\nRome, trying to arrange the universities there. Being a Protestant, the\r\nmission was one requiring peculiar forbearance and firmness. Yet the\r\nenlightened tolerance of Cuvier, and his mild and benignant manners,\r\ngained for him the esteem and respect of all parties. Risen from the\r\nranks, having been poor and often anxious to know how to learn, Cuvier\r\nwas a capital man for his position. He paid particular attention not only\r\nto the higher branches of education, but also to popular or elementary\r\neducation. His principle was that instruction would lead to civilization,\r\nand civilization to morality, and therefore that primary or elementary\r\ninstruction should give to the people every means of fully exercising\r\ntheir industry, without disgusting them with their condition. That\r\nsecondary instruction should expand the mind, without rendering it false\r\nor presumptuous; and that special or scientific instruction should give\r\nto France magistrates, advocates, generals, clergy, professors and other\r\nmen of learning. He taught—“give schools before political rights; make\r\ncitizens comprehend the duties that the state of society imposes on\r\nthem; teach them what are political rights before you offer them for\r\ntheir enjoyment, and then all amelioration will be made without causing\r\na shock. Imitate nature, which in the development of beings acts by\r\ngradation, and gives time to every member to arrive at perfection.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon had great confidence in Cuvier, and wished to make him tutor\r\nto his son, and ordered him to draw up a list of books as a preliminary\r\nstep. In 1814 he made him a councillor of state, and Louis XVIII.\r\nconfirmed him in the appointment subsequently.\r\n\r\nCuvier wrote in early life, on living and fossil elephants, the different\r\nspecies of rhinoceros, the structure of ascidians, and the anatomy of\r\nbivalve molluscs. Later on he described the crocodilians of the old and\r\nnew world and the fossil tapirs of France. Subsequently to 1801 he read\r\nmemoirs on the teeth of fish, on the worms, the anatomy of the mollusca,\r\nthe comparative anatomy and classification of fishes, the fossil mammals\r\nand reptiles, and the bony structures of these last two groups. Most of\r\nthese works were the joint productions of other very distinguished men\r\nand himself. Thus the work on fishes, which contained descriptions of no\r\nless than five thousand kinds, was by Cuvier and Valenciennes. Year after\r\nyear Cuvier added to the store of knowledge he was so anxious to give to\r\nthe history of the earth, and his descriptions, monuments of exactitude,\r\nof the fossil kinds of rhinoceros, hyænæ, and of some of the great\r\nsloths, were the result of his careful examination of the living species\r\nof the genera or families which were found fossil. We owe to Cuvier the\r\ntruth that ancient forms of life, the bones and teeth of which alone\r\nremain, and which were buried by nature formerly, can be “restored.” That\r\nis to say, by taking the existing or modern example, and by reasoning\r\nupon the nature of the teeth, claws, hoofs, and horns present or absent,\r\nthe nature, shape and destiny of the ancient animal can be given to the\r\nworld at the present time.\r\n\r\nAfter the abdication of Napoleon and the defeat at Waterloo, it became\r\nnecessary, in the ideas of Louis XVIII., that the universities should be\r\nremodelled, and a committee of public instruction was created to exercise\r\nthe powers formerly belonging to the grand master, the council, and the\r\ntreasurer of the University. Cuvier was one of the committee, and was\r\nmade chancellor of the University, a position which he retained until\r\nhis death under most trying circumstances. No man did greater or better\r\nand more lasting work for state education than Cuvier. His heart was in\r\nthe work of education; he had nothing but mental progress to desire; and\r\nit was a much more satisfactory thing for France to have a renowned,\r\nscientific man at the head of a great university, who, moreover, really\r\ncontrolled the education of the country, than to have had such important\r\noffices held by mere politicians and soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 Cuvier published a second edition of his “Fossil Bones,” and the\r\ngreat book, the “Règne Animal” (the “Animal Kingdom”), was re-issued.\r\nIn this last work Cuvier immortalized himself; and his classification\r\nhas been of the greatest possible value to his successors. He reduced\r\nthe six classes of animals which had been suggested by the ancients and\r\nLinnæus, namely, quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, and worms,\r\nto four, or vertebrated animals (animals with backbones), molluscous\r\nanimals (such as snails and oysters), articulated animals (insects and\r\ncrabs), and radiated animals (such as corals and sea anemones). Although\r\nthis classification has become modified, still Cuvier gave the method of\r\ntrue classification in animals. One or two points or peculiarities were\r\nnot to be considered at the expense of others which belonged to organs\r\nof great importance to the animal. He asserted that all the structures\r\nof the animal must be studied, and physiology as well as anatomy must be\r\nconsidered. The most important structures must be considered first of\r\nall, and the grand divisions of classification must rest upon them. In\r\nthe “Règne Animal” Cuvier commences with man, whom he places in a genus\r\nby himself, and recognizes only one species diversified by varieties or\r\nraces. In 1818 Cuvier visited London, and remained there for about six\r\nweeks, receiving every scientific and social honour. He mixed freely in\r\nscientific society, and was received by George IV. On being consulted\r\nby his Majesty about our national collections, he said that if all the\r\nBritish private collections could be collected into one, they would\r\nform a great national museum which would surpass every other. Cuvier\r\nwas greatly interested in the freedom of English politics; and on the\r\nelection for Westminster taking place he went on to the hustings. He\r\nwas intensely amused at the speeches and the violence of the mob, who\r\npelted their political opponents after the fashion of the day with bad\r\neggs, dead cats, cabbages, and mud. He went to Oxford, and then all the\r\nparty were invited to Windsor. Sir Joseph Banks asked everybody in the\r\nscientific world to meet Cuvier, and Sir Everard Home also. The great\r\nnaturalist, once a half-starved student and a tutor, became the guest\r\nof the most honoured amongst men, and was very sensible of the kindness\r\nshown him. He could not, however, reconcile himself to the long dinners\r\nand long sittings at table, which were then, as now, fashionable in\r\nEngland. Not only did Cuvier study the national and private natural\r\nhistory collections in this country, but he also paid much attention to\r\nthe system of education and to the nature of our political constitution.\r\n\r\nReturning to Paris, Cuvier was elected a member of the Académie\r\nFrançaise, and in the following year was made president of the Comité\r\nde l’Interieur, and created a baron. He resigned his temporary grand\r\nmastership of the University, so as to accept without salary the grand\r\nmastership of the Faculties of Protestant Theology, and vice-president of\r\nthe Bible Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, as president of the Comité, or one of the councils of state,\r\nCuvier took part in the coronation of Charles X., on which occasion he\r\nwas made grand master of the Legion of Honour. In 1827 he was appointed\r\ncensor of the press, an office which his love of liberty of thought soon\r\nmade him resign. Sacrificing all his leisure to the greater educational\r\nmatters, and ever labouring at science, Cuvier also formed a great\r\nlibrary, which was always open to naturalists who desired to visit\r\nand use it. Cuvier’s orderly and critical mind enabled him to fulfil\r\nthe office of secretary to the institute with great success; and he\r\nespecially shone in writing the interesting lives of the distinguished\r\nmen who died during each year. Moreover, he reported on each memoir\r\nwhich was submitted to the institute for reading and publication. Cuvier\r\nwas great as a public lecturer, and had a flexible and sonorous voice,\r\nwhich resounded far and wide in the room. His audiences were always\r\nenthusiastic; and many a student waited long to get a good seat before\r\nthe professor began. He taught, chalk in hand, and drew well on the black\r\nboard, his artistic power remaining to the last.\r\n\r\nCuvier came to England a second time, and it is tolerably clear that it\r\nwas to escape the inevitable revolution which was caused by the tyranny\r\nof Charles X. and his advisers. His carriage passed out of Paris, and\r\nfive hours afterwards firing began, which led to the dethronement of the\r\nking and the restoration of liberty. In London Cuvier used to enjoy the\r\npolitical and other caricatures in the shops, and loved to go down to\r\nsuch places as Richmond to see the scenery.\r\n\r\nAfter a six weeks’ visit, Cuvier returned to Paris, and occupied his\r\nformer positions and dignities.\r\n\r\nCuvier was slightly built in his young days, and moderately tall; but\r\nthe sedentary nature of his work and his carelessness about taking\r\nproper exercise, produced corpulence in his later years, and his extreme\r\nnear-sightedness brought on a slight stoop in his shoulders. His hair\r\nhad been light in colour, and to the last it flowed in fine curls over\r\none of the noblest heads ever seen. He was handsome and had regular\r\nfeatures, with an aquiline nose, a broad forehead, and keen eyes. The\r\nlove of order, which was his very peculiarity in his work, was seen in\r\nlittle things, for Cuvier was almost feminine in his attention to dress.\r\nHe even took in hand the costume of the University, and designed the\r\nembroidery of his court suits. Cuvier’s manners were dignified and yet\r\nnot ceremonious; for accustomed to mingle with the highest of all classes\r\nand countries, and naturally desirous of paying a just tribute of respect\r\nand good will to everybody, he was likely to be generally polished\r\nand courteous. He was stately enough sometimes, and his reserve with\r\nstrangers who were not open with him was mainly—as is usually the case\r\nwith others—from mere shyness and timidity. To the young he was always\r\nkind and sympathizing. When at the Institute Cuvier’s manner was always\r\nstately, for he was with his peers there, and perhaps he might have\r\noccasionally felt it necessary to retain an appearance of reserve during\r\nthe sometimes not very scientific discussions of that mixed assemblage.\r\n\r\nCuvier, notwithstanding his great patience when he was at work, and his\r\nsingular placidity when on the face of a difficult point in natural\r\nhistory or anatomy, was what is called a “Turk” at home, and with others.\r\nAccustomed to most minute exactitude, and to regulate his hands by his\r\nrapidly working brain, he was singularly impatient with other people who\r\nhad to serve under him. He used to hasten his workmen, so that his orders\r\nwere often performed with difficulty. He was hard to bear with, and any\r\nwaste of time the result of carelessness, put him in a rage. Anything\r\nwrong at table in his house, to be kept waiting, or some trifling\r\ndisobedience, would rouse an absurd amount of anger. His irritability was\r\nexcessive, and he frequently forgot himself in his scoldings, and had\r\nto make reparation afterwards. But he was always ready to testify that\r\nhe had been wrong, and to do his best to make amends; nevertheless, he\r\ndid not improve in this particular, and he never had great control over\r\nhis feelings. No labour, however minute and prolonged, irritated him\r\nwhen he believed that it was requisite for the attainment of an object;\r\nstill he could not listen to a few pages of a book which taught nothing,\r\nwithout expressing himself very decidedly. From what has been written of\r\nCuvier’s domestic life, it could not have been very enjoyable by those\r\naround him, and yet it was the kind of life which has to be led by most\r\nprominent men in science, art, and literature. Work, everlasting work,\r\nwith but little relaxation. He certainly wasted no time. Before and after\r\nbreakfast he saw anybody who wished to have an audience of him. By seven\r\nin the morning he was dressed, and began preparing his day’s work and\r\nthat of his assistants, so that by ten o’clock, when he breakfasted, he\r\nhad time to look at the newspapers, to read correspondence, and look over\r\nany particular works. After breakfast he dressed for the day and began\r\nwork. His carriage was punctual to a moment, and no one was allowed to\r\nkeep him waiting. When the ladies were to accompany him, they made a\r\npoint of being as exact to time as was possible; and he seems to have\r\nenjoyed the sight of his womankind rushing downstairs with their shawls\r\nstreaming after them and their gloves half on their hands. The instant\r\nhe had given his orders he would thrust himself into a corner of the\r\ncarriage and set to work reading, but suffered the ladies to talk as much\r\nas they pleased. The family dinner hour was half-past six; and if Cuvier\r\nhad a few moments to spare before that time, he would occasionally join\r\nhis friends in Madame Cuvier’s room, but more frequently he seems to have\r\ngiven even this short time to study. One or two intimate friends joined\r\nthe circle at dinner, and then Cuvier’s conversation was delightful. On\r\nproceeding to the drawing-room Cuvier sometimes gratified his friends by\r\nan hour’s stay amongst them before he retired to his occupation or his\r\nvisits, but so untiring was his industry, that he often set the whole\r\nparty to work aiding him in his researches. If he had any foreign works\r\nhe would often amuse his friends by verifying the figures in them, one\r\nafter the other. It must be said that this everlasting work was trying\r\nto people who were with Cuvier, for no sooner did friends come to stay\r\nwith him than he began to use them in tracing drawings on paper. He\r\nkept them at work, for when he returned from his labours he generally\r\nasked for the tasks he had thus set. Nevertheless, many found it a real\r\npleasure to work for him, for he was very grateful for such assistance.\r\nCuvier’s hours of relaxation were few. Change of employment afforded\r\nhim relief, and conversation still greater. At the close of the day’s\r\nlabour, when he found it impossible to work any longer, he was accustomed\r\nto throw himself on a sofa, hide his eyes from the light, and listen to\r\nthe reading of his wife or daughter, and sometimes of his secretary, M.\r\nLaurillard. These nightly readings lasted two hours, and thus Cuvier\r\nbecame more or less acquainted with the current literature and good works\r\nof the day. Very likely he did not listen, and went to sleep, but that is\r\nnot stated of him by those who wrote his domestic habits.\r\n\r\nCuvier was so downright that he did not like any one who indulged in\r\nsatire, or who ridiculed the conduct of others. He never did this sort\r\nof thing, and he carefully discouraged it in those about him, even when\r\nembellished with sallies of wit and drollery, and his rebukes to those\r\nwho indulged in sarcasm were accompanied by a sharpness of expression\r\ngenerally very unusual to him. He bore but little malice, and it is said\r\nthat the annoyances and disappointments of his public career left no\r\ntrace of bitterness of spirit; and he was always willing to lay the fault\r\non the ignorance rather than on the bad feeling of the offenders.\r\n\r\nWhen in the full swing of his career, Cuvier gave very interesting\r\n_soirées_ on Saturday evenings, and it is said that they were the most\r\nbrilliant and interesting meetings of their kind in Paris. They were\r\nmuch frequented by the scientific world of the time, and the rooms were\r\nas much open to the prince as to the last young student who had just\r\nbegun to study natural history. In this society Cuvier was an amusing\r\nconversationalist, a great asker of questions; and as he could talk\r\nwell on a variety of subjects, he made his guests at home, and gave\r\nthe meetings a character for freedom of expression of opinion. A light\r\nrepast concluded the evening, and a select few remained to partake of\r\nit. The chat was amusing, curiosities were shown about, and the last\r\nanecdotes about nature and the newest ideas were shown and considered,\r\nand, reserving himself to the last, Cuvier would relate something that\r\ncrowned the whole; and all around were struck by the occasional complete\r\nchange given to the train of thought, or were forced to join in a general\r\nshout of laughter. The period of these brilliant _soirées_ was that of\r\nthe prime of the lovely daughter who was so fondly loved by Cuvier. A\r\nperfect lady, of great grace and goodness, was Clementine Cuvier. She was\r\na highly-gifted girl, and her resemblance to her father was remarkable.\r\nShe had a delicate constitution, and gradually faded away, dying of rapid\r\nconsumption at last amidst the joyful preparations for her marriage. A\r\ngreat change then took place in Cuvier, who mourned his daughter greatly.\r\nSociety was given up for a long time, and when the evening meetings\r\nwere resumed, the life of them seemed to be gone, and the dejection of\r\nMadame Cuvier added to the feeling. After the death of his own daughter,\r\nCuvier became more than ever attached to his step-daughter, and his\r\ncare and anxiety on her account manifested itself on all occasions.\r\nIf she were ill he would be up and down stairs over and over again,\r\nand worried himself about even the most trivial symptoms. Although\r\nso greatly occupied and so often absorbed in scientific pursuits, he\r\nnever neglected the opportunity of doing good in his way. His private\r\ncharities were large and well bestowed. His purse was ever open to the\r\nneedy and unfortunate of all countries and stations, and the miserable\r\ninhabitants of the dens of Paris and the modest student struggling under\r\nadversity were alike the recipients of his bounty. Many hotels in the\r\nneighbourhood of the colleges and institutions had students in them,\r\nliving in the top stories, who were so poor that they had to subscribe\r\nto get a book or two between them. They would occasionally be surprised\r\nby a visit from their great teacher. He came to offer, with the greatest\r\ncourtesy, the assistance he knew they required; and if they were ill he\r\ndid not rest satisfied until he had obtained advice and nourishment for\r\nthem. Himself keenly alive to the slightest rudeness or neglect, and\r\ngrateful for the smallest proof of affection, he knew how to give, not\r\nonly with a liberal hand, but with a delicacy which never wounded the\r\nmost sensitive temper. The year 1832 was a melancholy one for Paris; for\r\npolitical disturbances and cholera prevailed. The disease raged around\r\nCuvier’s neighbourhood, and he saw many cut off from it in the midst of\r\ntheir youth and strength. At this time he gave up his evening visits and\r\nthe few relaxations he permitted himself to enjoy. Secluding himself\r\nfrom society, except that of his own family, he had no sooner performed\r\nhis daily routine of public duties than he returned to his studies with\r\na zeal and closeness of application that was doubtless injurious to\r\nhis health, though he himself said that he had never worked with such\r\nenjoyment. On Tuesday, May 8th, he opened the third and concluding part\r\nof his course of lectures at the College of France on the history of\r\nscience, and it was his last discourse. Strangely enough, it was as if\r\nit were to be his last, so impressive, so grandly comprehensive, was\r\nthe diction; and he treated the subject in a manner which proved that he\r\nhad been thinking much about the mysterious and supernatural environment\r\nwhich most men of great experience can recognize in nature. Cuvier in\r\nthis lecture dealt with the meaning of the changes which had occurred on\r\nthe surface of the earth in relation to the succession of animals and\r\nplants on the globe and the present creation. He stated the manner in\r\nwhich he proposed to view the present in relation to the past, a task\r\nwhich was to lead his hearers, independently of narrow systems, back to\r\nthat supreme intelligence which rules, enlightens, and vivifies, and\r\nwhich gives to every creature the especial conditions of its existence.\r\nHe noticed how each being contains in itself an infinite variety, an\r\nadmirable arrangement for the purposes for which it was intended: that\r\neach being is good, perfect, and capable of life, according to its order\r\nand species, and in its individuality. He concluded by saying, “These\r\nwill be the objects of our future investigations, if time, health, and\r\nstrength are given to me to continue and to finish them with you.” The\r\nlecture hall was slowly left by Cuvier’s hearers and students, and an\r\nundefined sadness seemed to weigh upon his late hearers, who seemed to\r\nlinger with the impression that his days were numbered. On the evening of\r\nthe same day, Cuvier felt some pain in his right arm, which was supposed\r\nto proceed from rheumatism. The next morning he presided over the\r\nCommittee of the Interior with his usual ability and activity; but at\r\ndinner that day he felt some difficulty in swallowing, and the numbness\r\nin the arm increased. When he felt himself thus ill, in order to take\r\naway the attention of Madame Cuvier, he said, “I must eat more soup,”\r\nswallowing bread even being impossible. Advice was sought, but during\r\nthe next day both arms became paralyzed, and the swallowing was worse.\r\nHe made his will with perfect calmness, and it evinced the tenderest\r\nsolicitude for those whose cares and affections had comforted his life,\r\nand for those who had aided him most in his scientific labours. He could\r\nnot sign the will, but it was attested by four witnesses. Convinced that\r\nall human skill was in vain, he nevertheless submitted to treatment by\r\nhis medical men. Paralysis crept on, and the legs were attacked, his\r\nspeech was affected, and he muttered, “It is the nerves of volition\r\nthat are affected.” He spoke of his last lecture, and said to a friend\r\nwho called, “Behold a very different person to the man of Tuesday;\r\nnevertheless I had great things still to do. All was ready in my head,\r\nafter thirty years of labour and research; there remained but to write,\r\nand now the hands fail and carry with them the head.” Cuvier gradually\r\nsank, but kept his intelligence nearly to the last. It was his wish to\r\nbe buried privately, interred in the cemetery of Père le Chaise, under\r\nthe tombstone which covered his beloved child; but it was not possible to\r\navoid the public demonstration of respect. The funeral procession was\r\nfollowed by the representatives of all the great learned bodies of France.\r\n\r\nCuvier was too generous, and too desirous for the advancement of his\r\nbranch of natural history knowledge, to die very rich. He had several\r\nimportant sources of income, and there is no doubt that, had he chosen\r\nso to do, he could have saved much money. He spent largely when it was\r\nnecessary to procure specimens from abroad, and to dig out fossils at\r\nhome, and his private charities were numerous. He only left about the\r\nsum of four thousand pounds sterling, a library worth about the same\r\nsum, and a house for his family. There is no doubt that Cuvier was, in\r\nhis private life, a very estimable man, and that in his public life he\r\nupheld the teachings of his conscience to his disadvantage. It was to be\r\nexpected that a man whose work proved the great antiquity of the kinds\r\nof animals now living on the surface of the earth, and the existence of\r\na great philosophy in nature which linked the past and present animals\r\nin a scheme which showed that life had been continuous for ages, would\r\nbe abused and called an atheist by some ignorant people or other. His\r\ntrue character has been written as follows:—“He promoted the cause of\r\ntrue religion by every means in his power, both public and private; he\r\nwas a warm supporter of the Bible Society, and caused the Old and New\r\nTestaments to be widely disseminated in every part of Protestant France.\r\nIn his letters to the heads of colleges and masters of schools, he\r\nstrongly recommended them to teach for the love of God, himself pointing\r\nout their duties according to that great rule. He adhered consistently\r\nand persistently to the Protestant faith, when it was well known that\r\na change to the Roman Catholic would have been the surest step to the\r\nattainment of the highest honours in the state. He caused a number of\r\nchapels to be established, in order to give facility for attending\r\ndivine worship; and he never would receive a salary for attending and\r\nadministering to the interests of the Protestant religion. He discharged\r\nfaithfully all the duties of his office, with a zeal which showed that\r\nhe had a much higher motive than that of gain or reputation. Humility\r\nand forgiveness marked his character; he was thankful for the correction\r\nof errors; he gloried as much in the discoveries of another as his own;\r\nand in the triumph of joint labours, unhesitatingly gave the preference\r\nto his colleague. He suffered his servants to expostulate with him,\r\nand the very nature of his amusements was social and cheerful. He felt\r\ningratitude keenly, and also unkindness and injustice, but they made\r\nhim sad rather than angry. His antagonists openly indulged in the most\r\nirritating and violent taunts, or secretly intrigued against him; the\r\nformer never excited him beyond a clear, firm, and dignified reply, wrung\r\nfrom him only when reply was absolutely necessary; and the latter nothing\r\nbut candid remonstrances. To these high attributes we may add charity.\r\nThe failings of others were never trumpeted forth by Cuvier; he did not\r\neven tolerate playful satire, however disguised by wit; his earnest\r\ndesire was to make all happy around him, even by a sacrifice of his\r\nown convenience; and his resignation was great, under calamities which\r\nbereaved him of the dearest objects of his affection; all these things\r\nappear to establish his character as a Christian.”\r\n\r\nThe character of Cuvier was hardly equal to this panegyric, for he held\r\nhis own boldly enough, and faced his enemies with no feeble humility;\r\nmoreover, the details of his everyday life prove that he was sufficiently\r\nexacting, and that everything had to give way to his will. Nevertheless,\r\nit is true that that will was to advance knowledge in the right\r\ndirection, and that it was stimulated by an earnest desire for truth.\r\nMen like Cuvier are very apt to be misunderstood by their most intimate\r\nfriends. When studying the collections of animals, and when comparing the\r\nforms of ancient and modern life, Cuvier mentally recognized a divine\r\nwisdom and the work of the God he worshipped. That was his worship, and\r\nhe probably cared all the less for the oratory of the pulpit, which he\r\nwas expected to listen to. He was not a constant attendant at his church,\r\nand this seems even to have afflicted his daughter when on her death-bed,\r\naccording to some reports. But in all probability she knew her father’s\r\nworth and real religion, better than outside friends and detractors, and\r\nprayed that he might receive that support which alone could enable him to\r\nbear the heaviest of sorrows with resignation.\r\n\r\nJudging the man by his fruit and life, it must be admitted that Cuvier\r\nwas one of the greatest students and teachers of nature that have lived,\r\nhis work, being true, lasts; moreover, there is no doubt that he had but\r\nfew failings, and a great amount of wisdom and virtue. Certainly he was\r\na staunch friend to religious education, and if one could have known\r\nhis heart, it is very possible that his apparent ambition and desire of\r\nsocial greatness and position may have been influenced by the knowledge\r\nthat influence and dignity would further his work both as an anatomist\r\nand zoologist, and as a responsible promoter of education.\r\n\r\nThe lives of these heroes have been mainly taken from the life of John\r\nRay in the Ray Society’s publications, and from an excellent little\r\nbook, by an anonymous author, called “Cuvier and Zoology,” and from the\r\n“Mémoires de L’Académie des Sciences.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nHEROES OF GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The rise of the science which treats of the ancient history\r\n    of the earth—Students of the present changes, which are\r\n    the examples by which the past may be comprehended—The\r\n    Greeks—The life of Pythagoras; a notice of the geology of\r\n    Aristoteles—Strabo’s life—The nature of fossils and the life of\r\n    Steno.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs was the case in the other branches of natural history already noticed,\r\nthe Greeks knew much more about geology than did the nations of the rest\r\nof Europe, subsequently, for nearly seventeen hundred years. The first\r\nrecorded teacher of the ancient history of the earth was Pythagoras, who\r\nwas born on the island of Samos, about the year 570 B.C. By his mother’s\r\nside he was connected with the principal families of the island, and\r\nhis father appears to have been a Phœnician or a Tyrrhenian of Lemnos.\r\nThere is nothing known about his childhood, and it is evident that he\r\nstudied under the great philosophers of his age in Greece. But he wanted\r\nfurther information, and therefore travelled into Egypt, and thence into\r\nChaldæa. Polycrates, the ruler of the island in which Pythagoras was\r\nborn, appears to have assisted him with the Egyptians by introductions.\r\nThe traveller noticed not only the habits and customs of the people he\r\nvisited, but also the aspect of the countries, and the method by which\r\nnature wore the earth, and produced changes on the surface of the ground.\r\nHe appears to have been much struck with the periodical nature of many\r\nnatural events, such as the succession of the seasons, the time of rain\r\nand inundation, and of great heat, and of all the common examples with\r\nwhich everyone is familiar at the present day. Returning home he soon\r\nbecame aware that he could not teach, unreservedly, what he had learned\r\nand discovered during his travels, for fear of Polycrates, and he left\r\nthe island. Finally he settled at Croton, in southern Italy, and he\r\nappears to have chosen the locality, in order to propagate his moral and\r\npolitical, as well as scientific opinions. Unfortunately, this ardent\r\nscholar and teacher did not write any books, but left that task to\r\nhis pupils and successors, so that much good sense is mixed with much\r\nnonsense in the so-called doctrines of Pythagoras which came from them.\r\nSome of his opinions are very remarkable and striking, and he introduced\r\ninto his own country the statements of the Eastern nations, that there\r\nhas been a gradual deterioration of the human race from an original state\r\nof virtue and happiness. But his principal work regarding the earth\r\nhas descended to us through the poet Ovid, and it is most interesting.\r\nPythagoras insisted that there was a perpetual and gradual system of\r\nchange, inherent in the earth. This idea, which came into his mind from\r\nthe results of observation, he did not apply to very remote ages, or to\r\nwhat is now called the ancient history of the globe. He simply insisted\r\non modern changes. Really this limiting of his thought was in the true\r\nscientific spirit, and he dealt with what was true and proveable so far\r\nas he was concerned. It might be supposed that the present changes cannot\r\ncome within the studies of the geologist, but they really do so, because,\r\nas will be noticed further on in considering the life of Hutton, the past\r\nhistory of the earth can only be comprehended by studying the present\r\nstate of things. Pythagoras cleared the way, and made a path for the\r\ngeologist. He is said by Ovid to have taught as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Nothing perishes in this world, but things simply vary and change\r\ntheir form. To be born means simply that a thing begins to be something\r\ndifferent from what it was before; and dying is ceasing from being the\r\nsame thing. Solid land has been converted into sea. Sea has been changed\r\ninto land; marine shells lie far distant from the deep, and the anchor\r\nhas been found on the summit of the hills. Valleys have been excavated by\r\nrunning water, and floods have washed down hills into the sea. Marshes\r\nhave become dry ground. Dry lands have changed into stagnant pools.\r\nDuring earthquakes some springs have been closed up, and new ones have\r\nbroken out. Rivers have deserted their channels, and have been reborn\r\nelsewhere; as the Erasinus, in Greece, and Mysius, in Asia. The waters of\r\nsome rivers, formerly sweet, have become bitter, as those of Anigrus, in\r\nGreece. Islands have become connected with the main land, by the growth\r\nof deltas and new deposits. Peninsulas have been divided from the main\r\nland, and have become islands, as Leucadia; and according to tradition,\r\nSicily, the sea having carried away the isthmus. Land has been submerged\r\nby earthquakes. The Grecian cities of Helice and Burris, for example, are\r\nto be seen under the sea, with their walls inclined. Plains have been\r\nupheaved into hills by the confined air seeking vent, as at Trœzene, in\r\nthe Peloponnesus. There are streams which have a petrifying power, and\r\nconvert the substances which they touch into marble. Volcano vents shift\r\ntheir positions. There was a time when Etna was not a burning mountain,\r\nand the time will come when it will cease to burn; whether it be that\r\nsome caverns be closed up by the movements of the earth and others\r\nopened, or whether the fuel is finally exhausted.”\r\n\r\nOf course there are several errors in these statements, and especially\r\nthose which relate to the causes of volcanic vents are absurd.\r\nPythagoras also noticed the changes in the animal kingdoms, such as the\r\nmetamorphoses of insects. Besides being a naturalist this great man\r\ntaught some most extraordinary doctrines for his time of the world and\r\nnation. He stated that virtue was with him and his followers, a harmony,\r\nunity, and an endeavour to resemble the Deity. The whole life of man\r\nshould be an attempt to represent, on earth, the beauty and harmony\r\ndisplayed in the order of the universe. The mind should have the body\r\nand the passions under perfect control; the gods should be worshipped by\r\nsimple purifications and offerings, and above all by sincerity and purity\r\nof heart. Pythagoras, by his good teaching and example, established a\r\ngreat school of philosophy, which influenced the world subsequently in\r\na marked manner. A political riot dispersed his followers, and he died\r\nabout 504 B.C.\r\n\r\nA notice of the life of Aristoteles as botanist and zoologist has\r\nalready been given, and now a few words must be said about the opinions\r\nheld by this very remarkable man regarding changes in the earth. He\r\nprogressed beyond Pythagoras, for he refers to many examples of changes\r\nnow constantly going on, and insists, emphatically, on the great results\r\nwhich they must produce _in the lapse of ages_. The changes of the\r\nearth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives,\r\nthat they are overlooked, and the migrations of people after great\r\ncatastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be\r\nforgotten. In one work Aristoteles wrote: “The distribution of land and\r\nsea, in particular regions, does not endure throughout all time, but it\r\nbecomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land\r\nwhere it was sea; and there is reason for thinking that these changes\r\ntake place according to a certain system and within a certain period.\r\nEverything changes in the course of time.”\r\n\r\nThere was a great geographer called Strabo, about whose life little is\r\nknown, except that he travelled far and wide in Europe and North Africa,\r\nand wrote largely on the earth. He did not content himself with simple\r\ngeography, however, for he entered into a discussion, which was a very\r\ncommon one in those days, as it has been since, concerning the nature of\r\nthe fossil shells which are found in strata or layers of the earth remote\r\nfrom the sea. He attributed the collecting of the shells where they\r\nare found to the former subsidence of the land, and not to the rising\r\nof the sea. It is not, he said, because the lands covered by seas were\r\noriginally at different altitudes, that the waters have risen or subsided\r\nor receded from some parts and inundated others, but the reason is, that\r\nthe same land is sometimes raised up and sometimes depressed, so that it\r\neither overflows or returns to its own place again. We must therefore\r\nascribe the cause to the ground, either to that ground which is under\r\nthe sea or to that which becomes flooded by it, but rather to that which\r\nlies beneath the sea, for this is more moveable, and on account of its\r\nhumidity can be altered with greater celerity. This philosopher clearly\r\nlaid down the law that the general level of the sea has remained the\r\nsame, but that it has been and is the land which has been or is upheaved\r\nor subsided. It is a fundamental truth on which much of the science of\r\ngeology depends. He moreover asserted that volcanoes were safety-valves,\r\nand were the result of subterranean convulsions.\r\n\r\nThese were the principal writers which influenced geology in the days\r\nbefore the Christian era, and it is to be noticed that they did not treat\r\nof the construction of the rocks, of the succession of the layers or\r\nstrata, or of much concerning the ancient history of the globe. But they\r\ntaught, wisely and admirably, the nature of modern changes, and believed\r\nthat these and the older ones they could comprehend, were part of a\r\nscheme, and were produced by natural causes, in the course of events.\r\n\r\nAristoteles, Strabo, and Plinius wrote about the changes which were\r\nprogressing on the surface of the earth, and compared them, in their\r\nreasoning, with changes they presumed had been, but still no great\r\nadvance was made.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the sixteenth century a remarkable discussion sprang\r\nup about the nature of shells and bones, which were found in layers of\r\nearth remote from the sea. The celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci had\r\nseen some of these fossils during his youth, when he planned and carried\r\nout some important canals in the north of Italy. He laughed at the\r\nfancies of the day about the shells, for some people said that they were\r\nmade by the stars, and others that they were brought forth naturally, in\r\nthe layers of earth in which they were found. He wanted to know where the\r\nthings were being made in the hills, by the stars, at the present time,\r\nand stated that, like the rounded stones of gravel, the shells had been\r\nin the sea, and that they were of different ages and kinds, and were once\r\nalive. But the former living condition of fossils, and the possibility of\r\ntheir being understood, by comparing them with recent or living things,\r\nwas, perhaps, most strongly put by Steno, a Dane.\r\n\r\nIn 1638, a goldsmith, Steno by name, living at Copenhagen, who was a\r\ntradesman of the King Christian IV. of Denmark, had a son. The young\r\nNicholas was brought up carefully, evidently was well educated, and was\r\ndestined for the medical profession. A strict Lutheran, he naturally\r\nwent to Holland for a part of his education, and studied at Leyden under\r\nthe very distinguished anatomists there, after he had taken his degree.\r\nNothing is known about his person or habits, but the results of his\r\nconstant labour prove him to have been a most industrious student, and\r\nalso an investigator of the human frame in his early days of manhood.\r\nAt first the medical profession was everything to him, and he studied\r\nhuman anatomy and physiology with great success, making some important\r\nand interesting discoveries. He discovered the duct or channel by which\r\nthe saliva runs into the mouth from the salivary gland beneath the skin\r\non the cheek, and in 1664 he published some researches on the manner\r\nin which the chick is nourished in the egg. Moreover, he examined the\r\nstructures of the eye of the calf, the nature of the mucous secretion,\r\nand wrote on the heart. While engaged in these researches at Amsterdam,\r\nhe heard of the death of his mother, and returned to Copenhagen. After a\r\nshort stay there, he set out for Italy, taking France on his way; and he\r\nbegan a series of researches on the structure of the brain at Paris in\r\n1664. Here a great change occurred, which influenced his future life in a\r\nremarkable degree. Steno, well known then as a successful investigator,\r\ncame under the notice of a great French geographer, Thévenot, and, what\r\nwas more important, became the friend of Bossuet, one of the greatest\r\npreachers and teachers the Roman Catholic Church has ever produced.\r\nSteno was so influenced by Bossuet, that he became converted to the\r\nRoman Catholic faith, and left the Lutheran Church. Going subsequently\r\ninto Italy, Steno pursued his studies, and settled in Florence, in\r\n1667, being well received by the Grand Duke Ferdinand II. de Medici. In\r\nspite of the somewhat natural jealousy of the medical men of the city,\r\nSteno was appointed physician to the Grand Duke, and prosecuted his\r\nanatomical studies under his influence. Then he came across a subject\r\nwhich directed his attention to geology, or rather to that part of the\r\nscience which relates to extinct animals. In a letter to Thévenot, Steno\r\ndescribes the dissection of a shark which had been captured off Leghorn\r\nin 1666, and especially discussed the mode of growth of the teeth of the\r\nanimal. At this time many fossils were picked up and gathered out of\r\nlayers or strata, which were called by many curious names, and believed\r\nto be anything but what they really were. They were distinguished by\r\nSteno at once as shark’s teeth, and he insisted that sharks lived during\r\nthe former ages of the globe, and that they had become entombed in the\r\ndeposits which were then forming a stratum or layer of earth, the result\r\nof deposition in water, being the burial-ground of the time of its\r\ncollection or formation.\r\n\r\nFossils were thus shown by Steno to be mineralized or petrified organic\r\nremains, and he gave the hint or method to future investigators, that\r\nthe example of the existing animals must be taken, in order to learn\r\nthe nature of those creatures whose remains are more or less perfectly\r\npreserved in the fossil condition.\r\n\r\nFollowing out this subject, Steno wrote on the manner in which deposits\r\naccumulate, and accumulated in past ages; and he concluded that if we\r\nfound a deposit containing sea-salt and the remains of marine animals,\r\nplanks of ships etc., we should believe that the sea had once been there,\r\nwhether the bed was exposed in consequence of the sea having retired,\r\nor because the land had been raised. He showed that although the lowest\r\nbeds deposited over any area, must conform to the shape of the underlying\r\nrock, the tendency of all sediment must be to occupy the horizontal\r\nposition; and so when we find them highly inclined, as in mountains, for\r\ninstance, we must refer this to subsequent movement. He noticed that\r\nmountains are made up both of horizontal and inclined strata, as may\r\nbe seen along their flanks. He infers that mountains were once not in\r\nexistence, and that they do not grow, but that their regions are raised\r\nand depressed and subject to rending and fissuring. Steno clearly showed\r\nthat the land had sunk and had been again elevated in the geological\r\nages, and in considering the causes he seems to have grasped the idea\r\nthat the internal heat of the earth becoming less, the mass cools, and\r\nthat the movements on the surface have had to do with the cooling. His\r\nmost important work was removing fossils out of the category of marvels,\r\nsports of nature, and as things which grew in the earth, to the proper\r\ntruth that they are preserved parts of animals and plants which were\r\nformerly alive. In 1688, Steno was appointed to the chair of anatomy\r\nat Copenhagen; but he had to suffer from jealousy, and doubtless some\r\nreligious persecution influenced his desire to leave his native country\r\nand to return to Florence again. This he did, and Cosmo III. entrusted\r\nhim with the education of his son. Steno then began to give up science\r\nand to study theology, and wrote several works on the subject by which he\r\nhoped to convert his old natural history friends. One of these involved\r\nhim in a controversy with the reformed clergy of Jena. The Pope, Innocent\r\nXI., rewarded Steno in 1677, by making him a bishop and apostolic vicar\r\nof Northern Europe. Steno went to reside at Hanover; but he had to leave,\r\nand returning to Schwerin, he died there. His body was, at the request of\r\nthe Grand Duke Cosmo, carried back to Tuscany in 1687.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF HUTTON.\r\n\r\n    The rise of the modern school of geology—The continuity of\r\n    the operations of nature and their sameness—The necessity of\r\n    studying the existing state of things in order to comprehend\r\n    the past—The denial of catastrophes—Hutton’s theory of the\r\n    earth the foundation of scientific geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany facts had been recorded regarding the ancient history of the earth,\r\nand a host of ideas, more or less absurd, had been given forth on\r\ngeology, during the years which preceded and followed the reformation.\r\nSeveral Italian geologists had examined into the truths discovered by\r\nPythagoras, and, as stated in the preceding pages, the nature of fossils\r\nhad become understood by a few liberal minded men. The age of Newton,\r\nand the years which followed his time, were consumed, however, so far\r\nas the history of the earth was concerned, by vain attempts to form\r\ncosmogonies, to account for the origin of the globe and visible universe.\r\nThere was also a fierce struggle between two great geological factions,\r\none asserting that all rocks were the product of heat, and the other\r\ndenying this _in toto_ and deciding that water was the originator. Many,\r\nand indeed nearly all, geologists taught that nature had acted during\r\nthe past, by fits and starts, and that great convulsions had occurred,\r\nbringing the earth at last to its present condition. The common sense\r\nof mankind was opposed to many of these beliefs, and there was moreover\r\na very great indisposition, on the part of many educated men, to credit\r\nthat the earth was more than six thousand years old. Not a few believed\r\nthat the hills and dales, mountains and plains, cliffs and valleys, were\r\nfirst formed as they are now.\r\n\r\nA Scottish gentleman, a quiet retiring man, having some means of his own,\r\nstudied the structure of the rocks and taught himself physical geography.\r\nHe mastered a great number of undoubted facts, and reasoned upon them,\r\nand produced a theory which made geology a science, instead of a jumble\r\nof guesses flavoured with the love of the marvellous.\r\n\r\nJames Hutton was the son of William Hutton, a merchant living in\r\nEdinburgh, and was born in that city on the 3rd of June, 1726. His\r\nfather, a man highly respected for his good sense and integrity, and who\r\nhad held the important office of city treasurer, died whilst the boy was\r\nyoung. The mother was a woman of considerable ability, and she determined\r\nthat her child should have a good education. He went, consequently, to\r\nthe High School, and subsequently was entered at the University at the\r\nearly age of fourteen. James was a thorough student, and loved work, and\r\nhis tastes were directed rather to natural science than to classics and\r\nthe higher mathematics. He studied mathematics under Maclaurin, and used\r\nto say in after years that although he enjoyed Professor Stevenson’s\r\nteaching of logic, still he thought more of him because a hint that was\r\ngiven in a lecture led him to take a passionate interest in chemistry.\r\nThe fact that gold is dissolved in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric and\r\nhydrochloric acids), and that two acids, which can each of them dissolve\r\nany of the baser metals, must unite their strength before they can attack\r\nthe most precious, was mentioned by the professor, in illustration of\r\nsome general doctrine. Hutton was much impressed with this fact, and\r\nwas led to study it further, and he got all the books on the subject.\r\nThis led to his love of chemistry, which never forsook him, and which\r\nreally decided the course of his career. But Hutton was destined for a\r\nprofession, and his mother did not intend him to occupy himself solely\r\nwith science. Consequently he was articled to a writer to the signet,\r\nwith a view of becoming a lawyer. He had hard work to do, and plenty\r\nof it; it was mere routine work, that of a clerk, and there was a\r\npossibility that he would forget his scientific pleasures. His desire for\r\nknowledge persisted, in spite of his monotonous work, and occasionally\r\nhe endeavoured to teach his fellow clerks a little, and he was found\r\namusing himself and them with chemical experiments, when he should\r\nhave been copying papers or studying the forms of legal proceedings.\r\nHis master soon saw that the young man’s mind was not that which would\r\nsuit a lawyer, so, with much kindness and good sense, he released his\r\nyoung friend from his obligations. Young Hutton at once began to study\r\nmedicine, as that science which was the most closely allied to chemistry.\r\nHe attended lectures, and studied well from 1744 to 1747. Then, as the\r\nteaching at Edinburgh was not sufficient in all the parts of medical\r\nstudies, he went, as was usual, to Paris, where he studied chemistry\r\nand anatomy with great ardour. He was there for nearly two years, and\r\nthen went to Leyden, in Holland, where he took his degree in September,\r\n1749. On his return to London at the end of that year, he began to think\r\nseriously about settling in the world. Edinburgh afforded no flattering\r\nprospect for his establishment as a physician. The business there was in\r\nthe hands of a few eminent practitioners, who had been long established;\r\nso that no opening was left for a young man whose merit was yet unknown,\r\nwho had no powerful connections to assist him on his first outset, and\r\nvery little of that patient and circumspect activity by which a medical\r\nman pushes himself forward in the world.\r\n\r\nFull of anxiety about the future, Hutton wrote to a friend of his own\r\nage on the subject. This was Mr. James Davie, with whom Hutton had\r\nbeen on most intimate terms before leaving Scotland. They had both\r\na great love of chemistry, and had experimented together, especially\r\non the nature and production of ammonia. Their experiments had led to\r\nsome valuable discoveries, and had been pursued by Mr. Davie during\r\nhis friend’s absence. They had afforded a reasonable expectation of\r\nestablishing a profitable manufacture of some salt of ammonia from\r\ncoal-soot. The project of this establishment was communicated by Mr.\r\nDavie to his friend, who was still in London, and it appears to have\r\nlessened his anxiety about settling as a physician, and, probably,\r\nwas one of the main causes of his laying aside all thoughts of that\r\nprofession. Perhaps, too, on a nearer view, he did not find that the\r\npractice of medicine would afford him that leisure for pursuing chemical\r\nand other scientific objects which he fancied it would do, when he saw\r\nthings at a greater distance. In fact, Hutton found himself in the same\r\nposition as many other men of genius who have pursued as successfully\r\nthe peculiar studies requisite for an accomplished medical man. Anatomy,\r\nphysiology, chemistry, and botany have often been much more attractive\r\nto the aspirant for medical fame than surgery, practical medicine, and\r\nthe study of drugs and their uses. Many a good doctor has been spoiled\r\nby over-education, and science has gained an enthusiastic student. It\r\nwould appear, however, that there was another cause which was influencing\r\nHutton. He had inherited a little property in land in Berwickshire from\r\nhis father; it was possible to live on it, and farm and work at chemistry\r\nwithout risk, whilst if he sold it, or used the rent in advancing his\r\nposition as a medical man, he might fail after all.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that he returned to Edinburgh, and in the summer of 1750\r\nhe abandoned his intention of practising, and resolved to apply himself\r\nto agriculture. He had as a friend Sir John Hall, of Dunglass, a man\r\nof ingenuity and taste for science, and also an agriculturist. As he\r\nwas never destined to do anything by halves, Hutton determined to study\r\nfarming in the school which was then reckoned the best, and the manner\r\nwhich is undoubtedly the most effectual. He went into Norfolk, and fixed\r\nhis residence for some time in that county, living in the house of a\r\nfarmer, who served both for his landlord and his instructor. This he did\r\nin 1752. He always spoke well of John Dybold, who made him comfortable,\r\nand whose practical lessons in husbandry he much valued. He appears,\r\nindeed, to have enjoyed this situation very much: the simple and plain\r\ncharacter of the society with which he mingled, suited well with his own,\r\nand the peasants of Norfolk could find nothing in the stranger to set\r\nthem at a distance from him, or to make them treat him with reserve. It\r\nwas always true of Dr. Hutton that to an ordinary man he appeared to be\r\nan ordinary man; possessing a little more spirit and liveliness, perhaps,\r\nthan it is usual to meet with. He enjoyed Norfolk life very much, and\r\ndoubtless it was the very different soil of that county which made the\r\nyoung Scotchman think, for the first time, about the construction of the\r\nsurface of the earth which he hoped to till and profit by. While his head\r\nquarters were thus established in Norfolk, he made journeys, on foot,\r\ninto different parts of England; and though the main object of them was\r\nto obtain information in agriculture, yet he never passed a pit, or a\r\ncliff, or a river-side, without studying the structure of the soil, so\r\nthat in 1753, Hutton was incontinently making himself a geologist, a\r\npursuit which his knowledge of chemistry and mineralogy rendered easy to\r\nhim. What agriculture he learned in Norfolk was of the greatest use to\r\nhim, and he visited Flanders to learn more. He travelled from Rotterdam\r\nthrough Holland, Brabant, Flanders, and Picardy, and was highly delighted\r\nwith the cultivation of the small holdings of those countries. Though\r\nhis principal object in this excursion was to acquire information in the\r\npractice of husbandry, he appears to have paid much attention to the\r\nmineralogy of the countries through which he passed. Then he returned\r\nand took up his own farm in Berwickshire, bringing with him a Norfolk\r\nploughman. He set to work and farmed, using every known improvement, and\r\nhe has the credit of being one of those who introduced the new husbandry\r\ninto a country where it has since made more rapid advances than in\r\nany other part of Great Britain. From 1754 to 1768 he resided on his\r\nfarm, visiting Edinburgh occasionally. He seems to have led a tranquil\r\ncountry life, succeeding as a farmer; and yet there was, during all this\r\ntime, a slow yet progressive growth of a science in his mind. Cautious,\r\npersevering, observant, and truly logical in his method of thought,\r\nHutton was accumulating facts upon which to reason in geology, whilst\r\nthe so-called geologists of the day were forming theories without facts.\r\nHe took a tour to the north of Scotland, through Ross and Caithness, and\r\nreturned by way of Aberdeen to Edinburgh, and he studied the mineralogy\r\nand geology of the districts. Returning home, he still went on farming,\r\nand at the same time he became a partner with his friend Davie in a\r\nmanufactory of ammonia. By the year 1768, being forty-two years of age,\r\nHutton had matured his plans; he let his farm at a very advantageous\r\nrent, and, untroubled about his affairs, having his three sisters as his\r\ncompanions, he went to Edinburgh, and entered the singularly interesting\r\nscientific society of that time. His biographer, Playfair, writes\r\nthat Hutton, “employed in maturing his views and studying nature with\r\nunwearied application, now passed his time most usefully and agreeably\r\nto himself, but in silence and obscurity with respect to the world.”\r\n“Free from the interruption of professional avocations, he enjoyed the\r\nentire command of his own time, and had sufficient energy of mind to\r\nafford himself continual occupation.” A good deal of his leisure was now\r\nemployed in the prosecution of chemical experiments. In one of these he\r\nmade an interesting discovery which relates to the changes that go on in\r\napparently most unchangeable rocks, and which are due to the action of\r\npercolating water on them. He noticed that in the midst of dense masses\r\nof hard, cold, volcanic rock, called basalt, crystals of great beauty are\r\nfound in cavities. They can be fused under the blowpipe easily, and that\r\nis not the case with the surrounding rock. On adding hydrochloric acid\r\nto one of these zeolites, as they are called, a gelatinous substance is\r\nformed out of the crystal, and on evaporation, sea salt or chloride of\r\nsodium is found. “This was the first instance,” writes his biographer,\r\nPlayfair, “of an alkali being found in a stony body.” He went to Cheshire\r\nto see the salt mines, went to Birmingham, and then set out for Wales.\r\nHis desire was to trace the hard gravel of granular quartz which is found\r\nin such abundance in the soil about Birmingham and elsewhere, to its\r\norigin, and to find out whence it came and how it was distributed. He\r\nfound none of the rock in Wales; but on returning he found it in places,\r\nin a body of old rocks which stand out of the country between Bromsgrove\r\nand Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThen Hutton wrote a little book on the “Nature, Quality, and Distinction\r\nof Culm and Coal.” The result was more economical than scientific, for\r\nit led to the abolition of a duty on the small coal of Scotland. He read\r\nhard, and every book on travels which referred to physical geography\r\nwas carefully studied, so that at last no man of the age was so fit to\r\ndeal with the great problem he had been revolving in his mind for thirty\r\nyears. All his studies of nature, all his examinations of the surface\r\nof the earth, were with a view of ascertaining the changes that have\r\ntaken place on its surface, and of discovering the causes by which they\r\nhave been produced. He was impressed with the belief that the former\r\nchanges in the earth’s surface have been of the same kind as those now\r\nin progress; that the ancient history of the earth could only be studied\r\nby taking the example of modern changes, and that the past could be\r\nstudied from the present, because there was uniformity and constancy and\r\nlaw in nature. The same energies and forces have always been and have\r\nacted by law in much the same manner as at the present time. With his\r\ntrue scientific spirit Hutton would have nothing to do with convulsions\r\nor with the origin of the globe; he did not want to guess or speculate,\r\nbut to argue logically on facts which anybody could observe. He took\r\ngeology out of the age of the marvellous and laid the foundations of\r\nthe present aspect of the science. He was in no hurry to publish his\r\nviews, possibly because his temperament was cautious, and possibly he\r\nwas aware what a furious fuss there would be made about it; how he would\r\nbe abused, scolded, and anathematized. There is no doubt that the lights\r\nof the age and public opinion were perfectly incompetent to judge the\r\nmerits of such a theory; they were sunken in prejudices, and resisted any\r\nchange of opinion. He was aware that a great outcry would be made by men\r\nwhose religious opinions were his own, and whom he respected greatly.\r\nIn fact, the world, just before the appearance of Hutton’s “Theory of\r\nthe Earth,” was less prepared for it than ordinary opinion was for the\r\ndoctrines of Charles Darwin one hundred years afterwards. The appearance\r\nof the work of this last great naturalist made, and is still making, a\r\ngreat stir, but that of Hutton’s work was received, as he anticipated,\r\nwith incredible opposition, by the teachers of the day; and its slow\r\nacceptation by the scientific world was remarkable. No abuse could efface\r\nits effects; it was true, and the true alone lasts; it was reasonable,\r\nand it was to the glory of God.\r\n\r\nIn this book, geology was, for the first time, declared to be in no\r\nway concerned about the origin of things. It was the first in which an\r\nattempt was made to dispense entirely with all hypothetical causes,\r\nand to explain the former changes of the earth’s crust by reference\r\nexclusively to such natural agents as still exist. Hutton laboured to\r\ngive fixed principles to geology, as Newton had succeeded in doing to\r\nastronomy. He wrote: “The ruins of an older world are visible in the\r\npresent structure of our planet, and the strata which now compose our\r\ncontinents, have been once beneath the sea, and were formed out of the\r\nwaste of pre-existing continents. The same forces are still destroying,\r\nby chemical decomposition or mechanical violence, even the hardest\r\nrocks, transporting the materials to the sea, where they are spread\r\nout and form strata analogous to those of more ancient date. Although\r\nloosely deposited along the bottom of the ocean, they become afterwards\r\naltered and consolidated by volcanic heat, and then turned up, fractured,\r\nand contorted.” He showed that many hard crystalline rocks, such as\r\nbasalt, were of igneous origin, and that some of them had been injected\r\nin a melted state through fissures in the older strata. He proved, by\r\nexamining Glen Tilt, that granite was once in a state of fusion, and\r\nhad cooled. He wrote: “In the economy of the world I can find no traces\r\nof a beginning, no prospect of an end,” a declaration all the more\r\nstartling when coupled with the doctrine that all changes on the globe\r\nhad been brought about by the slow agency of existing causes. Sir Charles\r\nLyell, writing on this, stated, “The imagination was first fatigued and\r\noverpowered by endeavouring to conceive the immensity of time required\r\nfor the annihilation of whole continents by so insensible a process; and\r\nwhen the thoughts had wandered through these intermediate periods, no\r\nresting place was assigned in the remotest distance. The oldest rocks\r\nwere represented to be of a derivative nature, the last of an antecedent\r\nseries, and that, perhaps, of one of many pre-existing worlds.”\r\n\r\nMost unfairly was Hutton attacked, and he was thus defended by his friend\r\nPlayfair: “In the planetary motions, where geometry has carried the eye\r\nso far, both into the future and the past, we discover no mark either of\r\nthe commencement or termination of the present order. It is unreasonable,\r\nindeed, to suppose that such marks should anywhere exist. The Author of\r\nnature has not given laws to the universe, which, like the constitutions\r\nof men, carry in themselves the elements of their own destruction. He has\r\nnot permitted in his works any symptom of infancy or of old age, or any\r\nsign by which we may estimate either their future or their past duration.\r\nHe may put an end, as He no doubt gave a beginning, to the present system\r\nat some determinate period of time; but we may rest assured that this\r\ngreat catastrophe will not be brought about by the laws now existing, and\r\nthat it will not be indicated by anything which we perceive.”\r\n\r\nHutton studied meteorology, and gave to the world the first reasonable\r\ntheory of the cause of rain. He described the formation of invisible\r\nvapour by evaporation, the production of visible mist and cloud, and\r\nfinally rain. And he investigated the reasons of the cause of rainfalls\r\ndiffering in amount in the tropics and temperate zones of the earth.\r\nIn 1793 serious illness attacked Hutton after he had been writing his\r\nspeculations regarding matter. On his recovery he republished his work\r\non the “Theory of the Earth,” and replied to many of the attacks upon\r\nit, and later on wrote a work which was not published in the “Elements of\r\nAgriculture.” Illness again seized him, and he died in 1797.\r\n\r\nHutton was such an observer of facts that he rarely read any books\r\nof a theoretical nature, and he never would concede anything to mere\r\nauthority. He was indefatigable in study, and wrote largely, expressing\r\nhis thoughts constantly with his pen. He rose late, and began to study at\r\nonce, and until early dinner. He rarely dined from home, and was a most\r\nsparing eater, and he drank no wine. After dinner he resumed his studies,\r\nor, if the weather was fine, walked for two or three hours, when he could\r\nnot be said to give up study, though he might, perhaps, change the object\r\nof it. He rarely departed from this kind of life, except when he was\r\ntravelling. To his friends his conversation was inestimable; as great\r\ntalents, the most perfect candour, and the utmost simplicity of character\r\nand manners, all united to stamp a value upon it. His slender, active\r\nfigure, thin countenance, high forehead, and somewhat aquiline nose, gave\r\nhim the appearance of being acute and vigorous in body and mind. He was\r\nfull of ardour and enthusiasm, gay and humorous, and most forcible in\r\nargument. The man’s simplicity, determination, and desire for truth, his\r\ncarelessness of the opinion of men, and his great regard for his fellow\r\nlabourers who were not led away by prejudice and authority, were his\r\ngreat characteristics. Hutton founded geology as a logical science; and\r\nalthough he was ignorant of the succession of the forms of life on the\r\nglobe, yet his method of studying the past from the present has been,\r\nand still is used as the way in which the extinct animals and plants can\r\nbe comprehended in the scheme of nature. Hutton’s works were carefully\r\nstudied by, and in after years they were the mainspring of the toil of\r\nLyell.\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting notice of the life of this great man in\r\nthe “Encyclopædia Britannica,” by Professor Geikie, and in an essay by\r\nPlayfair in the “Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh” to which\r\nthe author of this memoir is indebted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF WILLIAM SMITH.\r\n\r\n    The succession of the strata recognized—Strata known by their\r\n    fossils, position, and mineral contents—England surveyed by\r\n    Smith and made the type of the results of the succession of\r\n    changes studied by geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of William Smith were a race of farmers who owned small\r\ntracts of land, and had been settled in Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire\r\nfor many generations.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith was born at Churchill, a village in Oxfordshire, on\r\nthe 23rd of March, 1769, the year which gave birth to Cuvier. Of his\r\nparents he always spoke with great regard, but there is little in the\r\nrecollections which he has preserved of them, to show in what degree\r\nthey contributed to form his remarkable character. His father he\r\ndescribed as “a very ingenious mechanic,” and mentions as the cause of\r\nhis death a severe cold caught while engaged in the erection of some\r\nmachinery. Deprived of this parent before he was eight years old, it was\r\nfortunate for him that his mother was a woman of ability, of gentle and\r\ncharitable disposition, and attentive to the education of her children.\r\nAn expressive pencil sketch and a characteristic description, both from\r\nmemory, record his devotion to his mother.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own account, however, not only were the means of his\r\ninstruction at the village school very limited, but they were in some\r\ndegree interfered with by his own wandering and musing habits. The\r\nrural games in those “merrie daies” of England might sometimes attract\r\nthe wayward and comparatively unrestrained scholar from his books; but\r\nhe was more frequently learning of another mistress, and forming, for\r\nafter-life, a habit of close and curious contemplation of nature.\r\n\r\nAfter his father’s death and his mother’s second marriage, the person to\r\nwhom he was principally to look up to for protection, was his father’s\r\neldest brother, to a portion of whose property he was heir. From this\r\nkinsman, who was but little pleased with his nephew’s love of collecting\r\nthe “pundibs”[2] and “poundstones,” or “quoitstones,”[3] and had no\r\nsympathies with his fancies of carving sun-dials on the soft brown\r\n“oven-stone”[4] of the neighbourhood, he with great difficulty wrung, by\r\nrepeated entreaty, money for the purchase of a few books fit to instruct\r\na boy in the rudiments of geometry and surveying. But the practical\r\nfarmer was better satisfied when the youth manifested an intelligent\r\ninterest in the processes of draining and improving land; and there is no\r\ndoubt that young William profited in after-life by the experience, if it\r\nmay be so called, which he gathered in his boyhood while accompanying his\r\nrelative (“old William”) over his lands at Over Norton.\r\n\r\nWhatever he saw, was remembered for ever. To the latest hours of life\r\nhe retained a clear and complete recollection of almost every event of\r\nhis boyhood and often interested young and old by his vivid pictures\r\nof what he had seen when a child. These notices would be swelled to an\r\nunreasonable degree by introducing the pleasant stories of “the narrative\r\nold man;” but the following recollections, written in his seventieth\r\nyear, of events which had passed fifty-six years before, are worth\r\npreserving as evidence of this peculiar circumstantiality of memory.\r\n\r\n“I was early a tall and strong-grown boy, and in my way to London,\r\nbetween twelve and thirteen years of age, I particularly noticed the\r\ngreat work of cutting down the chalk hill at Henley-upon-Thames, and how\r\nthe loaded carriages on an inclined plane were made to bring up the empty\r\nones.\r\n\r\n“I was in London shortly after the riots of Lord George Gordon; and at\r\nthe time when news of Rodney’s defeat of the French fleet arrived.\r\n\r\n“There was then a halfpenny toll for foot-persons passing over\r\nBlackfriars Bridge; the Albion Mills (worked by steam power) had just\r\nbefore been burnt down.\r\n\r\n“Criminals were hanged at Tyburn, where there were cow-houses with wood\r\nseats on top for persons to see the executions.\r\n\r\n“From Manchester Square to the Edgeware Road and Paddington, there were\r\nfootpaths entirely across open fields. The buildings on the side of the\r\nsquare were unfinished; but, as more connected with what relates to the\r\nearth, I saw how the ground was made in Manchester Square, for a poor\r\nfellow, in turning his cartload of slush, had let his horse and cart slip\r\ndown, so that he was up to his middle in mud, endeavouring to extricate\r\nhis horse just as I passed by. This was on the east side of the square.”\r\n\r\nIn 1783, and from this time to 1787, the young man, without instruction\r\nor sympathy, prosecuted irregularly, but with ardour and success, the\r\nstudies to which his mind was awakened. He began to draw, attempted\r\nto colour, became tolerably versed in the geometry and calculations\r\nthen thought sufficient for engineers and surveyors, and by these\r\nacquirements, at the age of eighteen, so strongly recommended himself\r\nto Mr. Edward Webb, of Stow-on-the-Wold, who had been invited to make a\r\ncomplete survey of the parish of Churchill, for the purpose of enclosure,\r\nthat he became assistant to that most able and excellent man, and was\r\ntaken into his family.\r\n\r\nThis was the critical moment; from this event flowed all the current\r\nof his useful life, and to the same origin may be ascribed many of the\r\npeculiar habits and feelings, the contrasted lights and shades, which\r\ndiversified his character.\r\n\r\nEdward Webb was, like his pupil, self-taught, and very slightly\r\nacquainted with languages and general literature, but possessed of great\r\ningenuity and skill in mechanics, mensuration, logarithms, algebra and\r\nfluxions. His practice as a surveyor included many things now conceded\r\nto the engineer, such as the determination of the forces of water, and\r\nplanning machinery. His instruments were commonly invented, often made\r\nand divided by himself; peculiar pentagraphs, theodolites, scales, and\r\neven compasses and field books, of new construction enriched the office\r\nat Stow, and stimulated the young men who were fortunate enough to be\r\nplaced in it, to thought and exertion. “I admired,” says the subject of\r\nthis memoir, “the talent of my master, his placid and ever unruffled\r\ntemper, and his willingness to let me get on, for I required no teaching.”\r\n\r\nSpeedily entrusted with the management of all the ordinary business of\r\na surveyor, Mr. Smith traversed, in continual activity, the oolitic\r\nlands of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, the lias clays and red marls\r\nof Warwickshire; visited (1788) the Salperton tunnel on the Thames\r\nand Severn Canal, and (1790) examined the soils and circumstances\r\nconnected with a boring for coal in the New Forest, opposite the Shoe\r\nalehouse at Plaitford. All the varieties of soil, in so many surveys in\r\ndifferent districts, were particularly noticed, and compared with the\r\ngeneral aspect and character of the country, and the agricultural and\r\ncommercial appropriations. The arrangement of the lias limestone beds in\r\nWarwickshire contrasted with the neighbouring red marls at Inkborough,\r\nthe boring for coal in some dark lias clays on the road to Warwick, the\r\nabsence of arenaceous beds from the limestones of Churchill—these were\r\nsome of the points treasured in a mind capable of combining them at a\r\nfuture time.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 we find him engaged in executing surveys and complete systems\r\nof levelling, for the line of a proposed canal. In the course of the\r\noperations which he performed in the summer and autumn, a speculation\r\nwhich had come into his mind regarding a general law affecting the strata\r\nof the district, was submitted to proof and confirmed. He had _supposed_\r\nthat the strata lying above the coal were not laid horizontally, but\r\ninclined; that they were all inclined in one direction, viz., the\r\neastward, so as to successively terminate at the surface, and thus to\r\n“resemble, on a large scale, the ordinary appearance of superposed slices\r\nof bread and butter.” This supposition was now proved to be correct by\r\nthe levelling processes executed in two parallel valleys, for in each of\r\nthe levelled lines the strata of “red ground,” “lias,” and “freestone”\r\n(afterwards called “oolite”), came down in an eastern direction and sunk\r\nbelow the level, and yielded place to the next in succession.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time it was known to Mr. Smith that the position of\r\nthe strata of coal in Somersetshire was not generally conformed to\r\nthat of the “red earth” “lias,” and other beds above; the same thing\r\nwas proved to him by an inspection of the colliery at Bucklechurch, in\r\nGloucestershire; he knew besides that the great faults which divide _all_\r\nthe coal strata underground, were in general found not to divide _any_ of\r\nthe superincumbent rocks which formed the surface.\r\n\r\nGeologists who, at the present time, notwithstanding the devoted\r\nattention which has been paid to the phenomena of local displacement,\r\nfind a difficulty in understanding the causes, may imagine the perplexity\r\nin the mind of a _discoverer_. Mr. Smith felt this perplexity severely,\r\nbut not long. The Canal Bill, on which he was engaged, received the\r\nsanction of Parliament in 1794; and one of the first steps taken by the\r\njudicious committee of management was to depute two members of their\r\nbody to accompany Mr. Smith, “their engineer,” on a tour of inquiry and\r\nobservation regarding the construction, management, and trade of other\r\nnavigations in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThe tour extended altogether nine hundred miles, and occupied between\r\none and two months; by one route the party reached Newcastle, and by\r\nanother returned, through Shropshire and Wales to Bath. Mr. Palmer and\r\nMr. Perkins were gentlemen well acquainted with coal-working, and\r\nthey willingly stayed to inspect every new invention applied to canals\r\nand collieries; but Mr. Smith’s treasured object of consideration on\r\nthe road, that which occupied all his thoughts in the intervals of\r\nprofessional inquiries, was the aspect and structure of the country\r\npassed through, in order to determine if his preconceived generalizations\r\nof a settled order of succession, continuity of range at the surface, and\r\ngeneral declination eastward, were true on a large scale.\r\n\r\nIt is needless now to say that his general views were justified; he\r\nfound the strata from the vicinity of Bath and Bristol prolonged into\r\nthe north of England, in the same general order of succession with the\r\ngeneral eastward dip. There is, however, one part of the conclusions\r\nadopted in this rapid survey from a postchaise, which merits particular\r\nattention. He passed through York on the high road to Newcastle, and saw\r\nat a distance of from five to fifteen miles to the east the hills of\r\nchalk and oolite. He was satisfied of their nature by their _contours_\r\nand _relative position_, and by their position on the surface in relation\r\nto the lias and “red ground” occasionally seen on the road. This is, in\r\nfact, the only authority he could rely upon for drawing, in 1800, the\r\ncontinuations of the chalk of Wiltshire, and the oolite of Somersetshire,\r\nthrough the eastern parts of Yorkshire, but he drew them with a\r\nconsiderable approximation to accuracy.\r\n\r\nEngaged for six years in setting out and superintending the works on the\r\nSomersetshire Coal Canal, Mr. Smith found but few opportunities of making\r\nknown to scientific persons, the peculiar generalizations which had\r\ntaken possession of his mind. But in the execution of these works he was\r\nputting his thoughts into practice, informing the contractors what would\r\nbe the nature of the ground to be cut through, what parts of the canal\r\nwould require unusual care to be kept water-tight, what was the most\r\nadvantageous system of work. Another singular advantage attended this\r\nengagement. The notions which up to this time he had obtained regarding\r\nthe distribution of organic remains were comparatively vague. He found\r\npeculiar plants in the “clift” above the coal, particular shells in the\r\nlias and oolites, but none in the red ground, and he had combined these\r\nsimple facts so far as to see that “each stratum had been successively\r\nthe bed of the sea, and contained in it the mineralized monuments of the\r\nraces of organic beings then in existence.” But it was the necessity of\r\npossessing an accurate knowledge of the different sorts of rock, sand,\r\nand clay, which were to be cut through on the line of the canal, which\r\nled him to examine minutely and scrupulously into the distribution of the\r\n“fossils” which he had been in the habit of collecting. The result was a\r\nproposition which he proved to be locally true, and of practical value,\r\nand which has now a world-wide application, “that each stratum contained\r\norganized fossils peculiar to itself, and might, in cases otherwise\r\ndoubtful, be recognized and discriminated from others like it, but in a\r\ndifferent part of the series, by examination of them.” In other words,\r\nhe discovered that strata are to be recognized by their fossils. He now\r\nremarked also the contrast between the rounded state and mixed condition\r\nof the fossils which lay in gravel deposits and the sharply preserved\r\nspecimens lying in natural associations in the strata, and thus acquired\r\na notion of the distinction between what were afterwards named diluvial\r\nand stratified deposits.\r\n\r\nThe possessor of all these generalizations, now (1795) twenty-six years\r\nof age, was still shrouded in the obscure village of High Littleton, but\r\nin this year he removed to Bath, and took up his abode in the central\r\nhouse of a short range of buildings called the Cottage Crescent, which\r\noccupied a picturesque and elevated site south of that city. “From this\r\npoint,” says he, “the eye roved anxiously over the interesting expanse\r\nwhich extended before me to the Sugar-loaf mountain in Monmouthshire, and\r\nembraced all in the vicinities of Bath and Bristol. Then did a thousand\r\nthoughts occur to me, respecting the geology of that and adjacent\r\ndistricts continually under my eye, which have never been reduced to\r\nwriting.” He continued to direct all the operations on the Somerset Coal\r\nCanal, and very copious note-books attest the constancy and exactitude of\r\nhis attention to that occupation. To this cause, indeed, may be ascribed\r\nthe extreme rarity of any essays, or even memoranda, from which the\r\nprogress of his geological studies can be gathered.\r\n\r\nThat in January, 1796, he had begun to commit his thoughts to paper, in\r\na lucid arrangement for publication, the written proofs remain. In 1797\r\nhe drew a larger general plan for such a work; but not till 1799, after\r\nhis engagement ceased with the Coal Canal Company, did he make public his\r\nintention to compose a general work on the stratification of Britain, or\r\nenter on the prosecution of an actual survey of the geological structure\r\nof the whole of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the canal, Mr. Smith had found the means of applying\r\nhis newly acquired knowledge to useful practical problems, such as how\r\nto draw the line through a country full of porous rocks, so as best to\r\nretain the limited supplies of water which frequent mills left to the\r\nnavigation, where to place bridges on a good foundation, how to intercept\r\nand conduct the springs, and where to open quarries of proper stone. We\r\nfind him also engaged, as early as 1796, in the short intervals which\r\ncould be snatched from the main business before him, in putting to\r\npractical proof his theoretical views of the earth’s structure and the\r\nproperties of the mixed calcareous and argillaceous strata in the hills\r\nnear Bath, by a new and successful process of land-draining.\r\n\r\nThe earliest connected remarks which have been found, bear the date of\r\nJanuary, 1796, and relate to organic remains and their distribution in\r\nthe different strata. The vicinity of Bath is rich in fossils, and fine\r\ncollections were formed there previous to Mr. Smith’s researches. It\r\nmight be after inspecting some of these treasures, whose full value was\r\nso entirely unknown to their owners, that the following reflections,\r\nwhich strikingly illustrate the enlarged state of his own views at that\r\nperiod, were penned:—\r\n\r\n                                     “Dunkerton, Swan, Jan. 5, 1796.\r\n\r\n    “Fossils have been long studied as great curiosities,\r\n    collected with great pains, treasured with great and at a\r\n    great expense, and shown and admired with as much pleasure\r\n    as a child’s hobby-horse is shown and admired by himself and\r\n    his playfellows, because it is pretty; and this has been done\r\n    by _thousands who have never paid the least regard to that\r\n    wonderful order and regularity with which nature has disposed\r\n    of these singular productions, and assigned to each class its\r\n    peculiar stratum_.”\r\n\r\nGifted in a very uncommon degree with that philosophical faith in the\r\ngenerality and harmony of natural laws which is a characteristic of\r\ndiscoveries in natural science, Mr. Smith was at the same time remarkably\r\ndisinclined to indulge in himself, or even to tolerate in others, mere\r\nspeculations in geology. Whatever of this nature he found in the circle\r\nof his reading, was severely judged by a close collocation of the\r\nhypothesis which had been advanced with the phenomena of stratification\r\nwhich he had entirely established. These judgments might be erroneous\r\nin cases which required the knowledge of other data, not then collected,\r\nfor a true and general solution; but the very unreasonableness of raising\r\nthe standard of his own discoveries in a limited region, for condemning\r\na speculation perhaps founded on other truths occurring elsewhere, shows\r\nhow firmly these discoveries, and the influences belonging to them, were\r\nestablished and fortified in his mind. The following passage, written in\r\nJanuary, 1796, might have been acknowledged by the author to contain his\r\nreal opinions forty years later:—\r\n\r\n“Therefore every man of prudence and observation who has paid the\r\nstrictest attention to mineralogy, the structure of the earth, and the\r\nchanges it has undergone, will be very cautious how he sets about to\r\ninvent a system which nature cannot conform to without having recourse\r\nto subterraneous fires, volcanic eruptions, or uncommon convulsions, by\r\nwhich every hill and dale must have been formed and every rock must have\r\nbeen rent to form those chasms, which, in comparison to the strata they\r\nare found in, are no more than sun-cracks in a clod of clay; yet such has\r\nbeen the language of ingenious men, who have set their theoretical worlds\r\na-going without either tooth or pinion of nature’s mechanism belonging to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nIn October and November of this year (1796), we find him returning to the\r\ncontemplation of organic remains; discussing the circumstances which\r\nattend the sparry substance occupying the place of the shell, which has\r\nbeen removed, in the lias, and the empty cavity, where the shell was,\r\nsurrounding a loose stony cast of the interior, in the freestone (oolite).\r\n\r\nThat his mind was now actively employed in tracing out the bearings of\r\nthe extensive subject before him, will be evident from the following\r\nextract, dated August, 1797:—\r\n\r\n    “_Locality of plants, insects, birds, etc., arises from the\r\n    nature of the strata._\r\n\r\n    “Where art has not diverted the order of things and nature is\r\n    left to herself, a considerable locality may be observed in\r\n    many animals and vegetables as well as mineral productions, by\r\n    which they evidently attached to particular soils to such a\r\n    degree that, if this subject were studied with attention, it\r\n    would form one of the principal external characteristics of the\r\n    strata underneath. Though it may seem mysterious to some, that\r\n    birds, beasts, insects, etc., which have the liberty of roving\r\n    at pleasure, should feel any particular attachment for this or\r\n    that soil, yet the wonder ceases when we consider how the chain\r\n    of natural things is linked together, and how these creatures\r\n    are taught to cull their food from insects that are lodged in,\r\n    or seeds that are produced from, particular plants that grow\r\n    upon particular soils.”\r\n\r\nSmith had seen layers of limestone crowded with shells succeeded by\r\nothers containing corals. He found ammonites and oysters in some, and\r\ninsect remains in others, and his speculations assumed the curious phase\r\nof the sentences just noticed. But he soon became aware that accident had\r\nmuch to do with the presence of certain organic remains in strata, and\r\nthat, whilst some fossils, like corals, once lived where they are now\r\npreserved in strata, others were carried there as the deposit collected.\r\n\r\nA manuscript, dated December 2, 1796, Dunkerton, Swan Inn, headed “Strata\r\nin general, and their position,” and evidently intended for publication,\r\ncommences thus:—\r\n\r\n“The strata being found as regular on one side of a rivulet, river, deep\r\nvalley or channel as on the other, over an extent of many miles, when\r\nproper allowance is made for the inclination, and for the variation of\r\nthe surface, is it not reasonable to suppose that the same strata may be\r\nfound as regular on one side of the sea or ocean as on opposite sides of\r\na deep valley upon land, and if so, and the continuation of the strata\r\nis general, what is their general direction or drift? Is it in straight\r\nlines from pole to pole, or in curved lines surrounding the globe\r\nregularly inclined to the east?”\r\n\r\nAfter hinting at a general cause for such an assumed regularity, he adds,\r\n“But all theories are best built on practical rules, which will enable\r\nany one to make such observations for himself as must carry conviction\r\nalong with them; for a work so novel as this must expect to find some\r\nwho will hardly believe what is plain to be seen; for all men do not\r\nsee alike, nor can patiently trudge through the dirt to search for truth\r\namong the stubborn rocks where nature has best displayed her.... Shall,\r\ntherefore, describe a number of quarries, cliffs, etc., at a great\r\ndistance, etc. See Book——”\r\n\r\nIn what seems to be the continuation of this paper, we see the\r\npredominant desire of the author to establish the certainty and\r\ngenerality of the inclination of strata, which he had proved on a limited\r\nscale near Bath.\r\n\r\n“If the strata lay horizontal, every part of the sea-shore would present\r\nthe same beds at the water edge instead of that wonderful variety\r\nwhich is found on the coast and banks of every river and rivulet in\r\nthe kingdom, especially those that run in an east and west direction,\r\nor nearly so. In such situations the young mineralogist may soon be\r\nconvinced of that wonderful regularity which nature has adopted,\r\nespecially if the shores are rocky; he will there find that, independent\r\nof partial and local dips which appear in different quarries of the same\r\nstone, the outlines, or top and bottom layers of each complete stratum or\r\nclass of stones or earth, considered as a mass, have a general tendency\r\ntowards the eastern horizon.”\r\n\r\nBy the term “dip” is meant the inclination that strata make with the\r\nhorizon. Mr. W. Smith constantly brought forward his well worked out fact\r\nthat the strata of England dip from west to east more or less. The oldest\r\nstrata come to the surface in Wales and the lake districts, and because\r\nthey were upheaved the newer strata were tilted and curved, and the slope\r\nis to the east.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1798, we find as part of the introduction to this\r\ncontemplated work, an interesting notice of some of the steps by which\r\nthe author was conducted to his general conclusions.\r\n\r\n“It will be readily admitted by all classes of men, from the most\r\naccurate observers of nature to the simplest peasant, that there is some\r\ndegree of regularity in the strata from whence our building materials\r\nare generally collected. Masons, miners, and quarrymen can identify\r\nparticular beds of stone dug many miles apart; indeed, every cliff and\r\nquarry presents a true section of a great many beds of stone, which may\r\nbe found of the same quality and in the same position in all or most of\r\nthe neighbouring cliffs and quarries. And this regularity is nowhere more\r\nconspicuous than in the lias quarries of Somersetshire, from whence these\r\nobservations first took their rise, about seven years since.\r\n\r\n“For the stratification of stone struck me, who had not been accustomed\r\nto such appearances, as something very uncommon, and till I had learned\r\nthe technical terms of the strata, and made a subterraneous journey or\r\ntwo, I could not conceive a clear idea of what seemed so familiar to the\r\ncolliers; but when these difficulties were surmounted, and an intelligent\r\nbailiff accompanied me, I was much pleased with my peregrinations below,\r\nand soon learnt enough of the order of the strata to describe on a plan\r\nthe manner of working the coal in the lands I was then surveying.\r\n\r\n“Being engaged soon after to survey the lands and take the levels of\r\na canal that was proposed to be made from the collieries to Bath, I\r\nobserved a variation of the strata on the same line of level, and soon\r\nfound that the lias rock, which about three miles back was full three\r\nhundred feet above this line, was now thirty feet below it, and became\r\nthe bed of the river, and in that direction did not appear any more at\r\nthe surface. This induced me to note the inclination of the same rock,\r\nwhich I knew was to be found at the head of two other valleys lying each\r\nabout a mile distant from, and in a parallel direction to, the one just\r\ndescribed, and accordingly found it to dip the same to the south-east,\r\nand sink under the rivers in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n“From this I began to consider that other strata might also have some\r\ngeneral inclination as well as this (though I had been frequently\r\ntold by the colliers that there was no regularity in the strata above\r\nground), yet, by tracing them through the country some miles, I found the\r\ninclination of every bed to be nearly the same as [that of] the lias;\r\nand notwithstanding the partial and local dips of many quarries which\r\nvaried from this rule, I was thoroughly satisfied by these observations\r\nthat everything had a general tendency to the south-east, and thence\r\nconcluded there could be none of these beds to the north-west, the truth\r\nof which conjecture was soon verified by a tour of observation through\r\nthe northern parts of this kingdom.”\r\n\r\nIn March, 1798, Mr. Smith purchased a small but beautiful estate, in\r\na deep valley, within three miles of Bath, almost overgrown with wild\r\nwood, hiding in its bosom a sheet of water and a small mill. Through\r\nthis retired possession the canal was cut, without greatly injuring its\r\nremarkable beauty; and, under Mr. Smith’s fond and tasteful attention the\r\nscene was partly cleared, the pond expanded to a lake, the cottage became\r\na comfortable home, in which he passed many happy and thoughtful hours.\r\nHe did not, however, at any time reside long in this favourite retreat,\r\nbut took up his station for about a year at the village of Mitford, near\r\nBath, and engaged in the last duties which he performed as resident\r\nengineer to the Coal Canal.\r\n\r\nOwing to a misunderstanding with the Company, this occupation ceased\r\nin June, 1799, and Mr. Smith felt and acknowledged that a new era in\r\nhis life had arrived. He was not only at liberty, but placed under the\r\nnecessity to consider the best means of making known his geological\r\nsystem, and of founding upon it a professional practice, which might\r\nprovide the expense of travelling to verify and extend his knowledge, and\r\nfill up the outline of a geological map of England and Wales.\r\n\r\nIn these objects, which were ever closely associated in his own mind,\r\nhe was successful; the most valuable portions of his discoveries soon\r\nbecame public property, and he quickly acquired extensive employment in\r\nthe practical applications of these discoveries to mineral surveying\r\nand draining of land on a large scale. The extensive diffusion of\r\nhis fame and opinions, which now began, was owing to no actual and\r\nauthorized publication, but to continual discussions and explorations\r\nwith several active friends, oral communications and exhibitions of maps\r\nat agricultural meetings (then frequent), and circulation of manuscript\r\ncopies of tabular expositions of the series of strata at that time\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nHis views at this epoch appear by the following notice:—\r\n\r\n“During my five years’ close confinement to practical engineering on the\r\nCoal Canal, my much-wished-for opportunity of collecting observations\r\nenough from the ranges of the different strata to make an accurate\r\ndelineation of the stratification throughout England were suspended.\r\n\r\n“I had seen enough by my tour of August, 1794, to satisfy myself of the\r\npracticability of doing it, and often wasted much time in poring over\r\nmaps, in contriving how the ranging edges and planes of different strata\r\ncould best be rendered intelligible: models were thought of, and one\r\nsmall map was cut along the edges of some of the strata with a view of\r\ndefining their extent, and of showing how one stratum was successively\r\ncovered by another.\r\n\r\n“I drew in colours, on a map of the vicinity of Bath, and on ‘Day and\r\nMasters’ county survey,’ all [that had been observed] very accurately to\r\na certain extent, which embraced an interesting but intricate variety of\r\nstrata in hills around Bath; and some small maps of England were spoiled\r\nby speculating on the ranges of stratification without sufficient data.\r\nThe intricacies in their marginal edges were such that I found, to mark\r\npoint by point, as the facts were ascertained, was the only way in which\r\nI could safely proceed.\r\n\r\n“My experience in what I had done upon the Somersetshire map was\r\nsufficient to convince me that to make a map of the strata on a scale\r\nas large as Cary’s England (five miles to an inch), with sufficient\r\naccuracy, much of it should first be drawn on a larger scale.”\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Mr. Smith, and for the progress of his views, that\r\nhe gained at this time the friendship of a man singularly competent to\r\nestimate the truth and value of these views, and both able and willing\r\nto advocate the merit of their author. The Rev. Benjamin Richardson was\r\nat this time living in Bath, and possessed a choice collection of local\r\nfossils, mostly gathered by his own diligent hands. Extensively versed\r\nin natural history, and generally well acquainted with the progress of\r\nscience, he was perfectly enthusiastic in following out, and liberal in\r\nenabling others to prosecute, new and ingenious researches, especially\r\nif they tended to practical and public good. He knew accurately the\r\ncountry in which Mr. Smith had principally worked, and was acquainted\r\nwith the views entertained on the subject of fossils, which had been\r\nrecorded in books, or were adopted by the collectors, who were even then\r\ncelebrated in the vicinity of Bath. He had no knowledge of the laws of\r\nstratification and the connection between the forms of organic life and\r\nthe order of superposition of the strata; while, on the other hand, his\r\nnew friend had very little knowledge of the true nature of these organic\r\nforms, and their exact relation to analogous living types. The result of\r\na meeting between two such reciprocally adjusted minds was an electric\r\ncombination; the fossils which the one possessed were marshalled in the\r\norder of strata by the other, until they all found their appropriate\r\nplaces, and the arrangement of the cabinet became a true copy of nature.\r\n\r\nThat such fossils had been found, in such rocks, was immediately\r\nacknowledged by Mr. Richardson to be true, though the connection had\r\nnot before presented itself to his mind; but when Mr. Smith added the\r\nassurance, that everywhere throughout this district, and to considerable\r\ndistances around, it was a general law that the “_same strata were found\r\nalways in the same order of superposition and contained the same peculiar\r\nfossils_,” his friend was both astonished and incredulous. He immediately\r\nacceded to Mr. Smith’s proposal for undertaking some field examinations\r\nto determine the truth of these assertions, and having interested in the\r\nobject a new and learned associate, the Rev. Joseph Townsend (author\r\nof “Travels in Spain”), they at once executed the project. Among other\r\nplaces visited with this view was the detached hill on which Dundry\r\nChurch is conspicuously elevated. From its form and position in respect\r\nof the lias of Keynsham, Mr. Smith had inferred that this hill was capped\r\nby the lowest of the Bath “freestones” (inferior oolite); and, from his\r\ngeneral views, he expected to find in that rock the fossils which the\r\nfreestones contained near Bath; that is to say, on the westward rise,\r\nwhich he believed to affect all the strata near Bath above the coal. It\r\nis needless now to say, that examination confirmed both the inference of\r\nthe character of the rock and the conformity of its organic contents.\r\nThe effect of this and other illustrations of the reality of Mr. Smith’s\r\nspeculations was decisive. In general literature, and especially in\r\nnatural history, Mr. Smith was immeasurably surpassed by his friends,\r\nbut they acknowledged that, from his labours in a different quarter, a\r\nnew light had begun to manifest itself in the previously dark horizon of\r\ngeology, and they set themselves earnestly to make way for its auspicious\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nWhat a step was made from the old ideas that fossils were sports of\r\nnature to the proof that during the long ages of the earth’s history\r\nevery deposit of river mud, sea-shore sand, and marine collection\r\ncontained relics of its age of accumulation; and that there has been a\r\nsuccession of animals and plants on the earth foreshadowing those that\r\nnow exist.\r\n\r\nOne day, after dining together at the house of the Rev. Joseph Townsend,\r\nit was proposed by one of this triumvirate, that a tabular view of the\r\nmain features of the subject, as it had been expounded by Mr. Smith,\r\nand verified and enriched by their joint labours, should be drawn up\r\nin writing. Richardson held the pen, and wrote down, from Smith’s\r\ndictation, the different strata according to their order of succession in\r\ndescending order, commencing with the chalk, and numbered, in continuous\r\nseries, down to the coal, below which the strata were not sufficiently\r\ndetermined, according to the scheme already noticed.\r\n\r\nTo this description of the strata was added, in the proper places, a list\r\nof the most remarkable fossils which had been gathered in the several\r\nlayers of rock. The names of these fossils were principally supplied\r\nby Mr. Richardson, and are such as were then, and for a long time\r\nafterwards, familiarly employed in the many collections near Bath. Of the\r\ndocument thus jointly arranged each person present took a copy, under no\r\nstipulation as to the use which should be made of it, and accordingly it\r\nwas extensively distributed, and remained for a long period the type and\r\nauthority for the descriptions and order of superposition of the strata\r\nnear Bath.\r\n\r\nYears rolled on, and Smith’s wanderings over England and their results\r\nwere laid down by him on a map, which was to be published. With regard\r\nto this map of the strata, it may be said that it was very trying work\r\nfor the publisher as well as the author. The basis of the map, as\r\nalready explained, was in many respects peculiar; the colouring of it\r\nwas more so. Instead of the _flat colouring_ ending in narrow defined\r\nedges usually employed for maps, Mr. Smith introduced a peculiar style\r\nof _full tints_ for the edges of the strata, _softened_ into the paler\r\ntint employed for the remainder of the area which they occupied on the\r\nsurface. This new style of colouring gave a picturesque effect to the\r\nmap, but required more than usual skill and patience to be correctly\r\nexecuted, and occasioned great trouble in examining the copies. The\r\ncolouring of the map was thus rendered more expensive than had been\r\nanticipated, and notwithstanding the labour was well paid for, it was not\r\nalways at first properly performed.\r\n\r\nAt length the difficulties inseparable from such a task were so far\r\novercome, and this enormous labour was so far completed, that a coloured\r\nmap of the strata of England and Wales was submitted to the consideration\r\nof the Society of Arts, supported by various testimonials of its general\r\naccuracy and value, in April and May, 1815. The result was the award of\r\nthe premium of £50, which had been in vain offered for very many years\r\nfor a work of this description—a reward which Mr. Smith might have\r\nclaimed long ago, had not an honest desire to produce his work complete\r\nwithheld the attempt. The map was published on the 1st of August, 1815,\r\ndedicated to Sir Joseph Banks, and from that hour the fame of its author\r\nas a great original discoverer in English geology was secured. Would\r\nthat this epoch of his revived and enlarged reputation had also been the\r\ndawn of more prosperous fortunes, or that, satisfied with the degree\r\nin which he had accomplished his gigantic task, he had left to others\r\nthe completion of his work, and devoted himself for a time to even the\r\nhumblest of those professional labours by which he had been at least\r\nsupported through oppressive difficulties, and by which he must have\r\nalready grown comparatively rich but for the incessant drain of money in\r\nfollowing up discoveries which no living man could reasonably hope to\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nScience, indeed, is a mistress whose golden smiles are not often lavished\r\non poor and enthusiastic suitors. The time for a strenuous exertion was\r\nindeed come. Geology had kept him poor by consuming all his professional\r\ngains; the neglect of his employers too often left these unpaid; in\r\nsuch a condition one unfortunate step was ruin, and that step was\r\nmade. On the property which he had purchased near Bath, and which he\r\nhad greatly improved, he was tempted to lay a railway for bringing the\r\nfreestone of Comb down to the Coal Canal, to open new quarries of this\r\nstone, and to establish new machinery for cutting and shaping it for\r\nbuildings. The project, which looked well at first, failed utterly by\r\nthe unexpected deficiency of the stone, on whose good quality the whole\r\nsuccess depended. The abandonment of this cherished scheme was followed\r\nby the compulsory sale of the still more cherished property, a load of\r\ndebt remained to be discharged, and the miserable effects fell heavily on\r\nothers besides himself. But there were not wanting persons of station,\r\nknowledge, and humanity, who, esteeming Mr. Smith and admiring his\r\nsolitary and ceaseless industry, exerted themselves to save him from the\r\nsad fate which seemed to await him.\r\n\r\nSuch things are common in the lives of men, but they are not often\r\nencountered by so resolved and patient a spirit as that of Mr. Smith. One\r\nwho saw the struggle may boldly say this, because there can be no other\r\nmotive for mentioning private and personal griefs but to show forth the\r\ncharacter of the mind which could firmly bear and overcome them. As a\r\nmean of reducing his difficulties he proposed to sell that geological\r\ncollection which had been so much prized, and through the assistance of\r\nsome friends a communication was opened with the Treasury. Two gentlemen\r\nbeing deputed to examine the collection, reported favourably, and their\r\nlordships were pleased to authorize the purchase, in order that the\r\nspecimens might be fitted up in the British Museum. There was also some\r\ndefined notion of engaging Mr. Smith’s services at the museum to take\r\ncharge of and explain the geological principles which this collection\r\nwas intended to illustrate; but this project came to nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1818-19, Mr. Smith revisited, after an absence of ten\r\nyears, his native village, re-examined the unforgotten localities where\r\nin childhood his “pundibs” and “poundstones” were gathered, and collected\r\n“marlstone” fossils from an excavation at Churchill Mill, nearly at the\r\nsame points where he had noticed them in 1787. In one whose life had been\r\none long wandering, and who had earned for himself an immortal name,\r\nthis return to the haunts of his childhood and the simplicity of village\r\noccupations, must have excited many interesting reflections. He had sold\r\nhis patrimony, and what had been the modest dwelling of his ancestors\r\nfor two hundred years; he had disbursed in travelling for what he deemed\r\na public object all that he had earned; while one of his two brothers,\r\nquietly prosecuting trade in his native village, had grown a rich and\r\nprosperous man.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1819 Mr. Smith gave up his house in London, after\r\nfifteen years’ occupation, and was compelled to submit to the sale of\r\nhis furniture, collections, and books, preserving in fact, only his\r\npapers, maps, sections and other drawings, through the kindness of a most\r\nfaithful friend. While this happened, he was in Yorkshire busily engaged,\r\napparently oblivious, perhaps sternly regardless, of what seemed to\r\nothers an insupportable misfortune. He deemed it an inevitable corollary\r\nto his irretrievable losses in the unlucky speculation already mentioned\r\nnear Bath, and armed himself with what seemed more than fortitude to meet\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOne more used to monetary arrangements would have foreseen and averted\r\nthis occurrence; but on the practical geologist the blow fell with\r\nstunning effect. He surrendered with deep regret his interest in the\r\nmuch-loved and really valuable little property near Bath, quitted London,\r\nand consented to have no home. From this time for seven years he became\r\na wanderer in the north of England, rarely visiting London, except when\r\ndrawn thither by the professional engagements which still, even in\r\nhis loneliest retirements, were pressed upon him, and yielded him an\r\nirregular, contracted, and fluctuating income.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1819-20, Mr. Smith, having perhaps more than usual\r\nleisure, undertook to walk from Lincolnshire into Oxfordshire. The object\r\nproposed was to pass along a particular line through the counties of\r\nRutland, Northampton, Bedford, and Oxford, but the ultimate destination\r\nwas Swindon, in Wiltshire.\r\n\r\n“Leaving the great road at Colsterworth, with some reflections on the\r\nbirthplace of Newton,[5] we crossed in a day’s easy walk, the little\r\ncounty of Rutland, its hills of oolite and sand, its slopes of upper\r\nlias, and its valleys often showing marlstone, and reached the obscure\r\nvillage of Gretton, on the edge of Rockingham Forest. Whatever may now\r\nbe the accommodations at this village, they were very wretched in 1819\r\n(December), but the odd stories of supernatural beings and incredible\r\nfrights which were narrated by the villagers assembled at the little inn,\r\ngreatly amused Mr. Smith, and reminded him of exactly parallel tales\r\nwhich circulated around Whichwood Forest in his boyhood.\r\n\r\n“The next morning we walked to Kettering, noticing on the road the\r\npeculiar characters of the Northamptonshire oolite. In this walk Mr.\r\nSmith had somehow sprained or over-fatigued himself, and he chose to\r\nproceed to Wellingborough in a chaise. From this point, situated on sand\r\nof the oolite series, we resumed our geological proceedings on foot,\r\nand passing by Irchester, Woolaston, and Boziate, traversed in the next\r\nhills the oolite, the forest marble, the cornbrash, and an outlier of\r\nKelloway’s rock. The road up Boziate Hill was mantled with fossiliferous\r\nstone, some of which, obtained from the hill-top, was believed to be\r\nKelloway’s rock, and was found to contain _Ammonites sublævis_ and other\r\nfossils. A fine specimen of this ammonite was here laid by a particular\r\ntree on the road side, as it was large and inconvenient for the pocket,\r\naccording to a custom often observed by Mr. Smith, whose memory for\r\nlocalities was so exact, that he has often, after many years, gone direct\r\nto some hoard of this nature, to recover his fossils. This road, however,\r\nover Boziate Hill, he was not to travel again.\r\n\r\n“From Olney to Buckingham the route was performed in chaise. The stone\r\ndug here in clay attracted much attention, and Mr. Smith doubted whether\r\nto rank it as forest marble or cornbrash. We now crossed the oolitic\r\ncountry to Aynhoe, celebrated for its fossils, on foot; next day\r\ncontinued the walk to Deddington, Chapelhouse, and Churchill, and after\r\na few days walked to Burford, and then travelled in the ordinary way\r\nto Swindon, Oxford, and London. In passing through Oxford, Mr. Smith,\r\nfor the first time in his life, had the pleasure of seeing Professor\r\nBuckland, at the house of Mr. Bliss, the bookseller, with whom he walked\r\nover Shotover Hill, on his way toward London.”\r\n\r\nThis little tour is thus briefly narrated, because it appears in all\r\nrespects a fair example of the usual way in which Mr. Smith explored\r\nthe country, walking when the object he had in view required this mode\r\nof examination, travelling as fast as possible in all other cases, but\r\nalways recording in note-books or on maps, the observations he made.\r\n\r\nUp in the north of England on the east coast Smith loved to wander\r\nbeneath the cliffs, noting the minutest variations in the stratification,\r\ndetecting the slightest marks of dislocation, watching the peculiarities\r\nof the sea’s action on materials of unlike qualities, and inferring the\r\ncauses which had anciently modified the outline of the land, and covered\r\nthe low cliffs of the oolitic series with fragments of the lias from\r\nWhitby, of the coal and limestone from Teesdale or Swaledale, and of the\r\ngranite and syenite from the Shap Fells and Carrock Pike. In numerous\r\npapers dedicated to the local geology of Scarborough, his reflections\r\non these subjects are recorded; his exertions in examining one curious\r\ncase of dislocation on the north side of the Castle Hill, brought on\r\nrheumatic, or rather a paralytic affection of the muscles of the lower\r\nextremities, which bound him a prisoner in bed in the early part of 1825.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this accident, he had taken part in a course of lectures to\r\nthe Literary and Philosophical Society of Hull; after it had occurred,\r\nand before its effects were removed, while yet he was incapable of\r\nwalking, and was actually lifted into the carriage which took him away,\r\nhe accepted and executed a similar engagement proposed by the Literary\r\nand Philosophical Society of Sheffield. It was a singular spectacle,\r\nto witness the delivery of lectures which required continual reference\r\nto large maps and numerous diagrams, by a man who could not stand, but\r\nwas forced to read his address from a chair, to an audience of several\r\nhundred persons in a room not very well adapted for the voice. But it\r\nwas far more extraordinary to witness during all the severity of the\r\ndisorder, the unpretending patience and fortitude of the sufferer, who,\r\nhad he then permitted his mind to dwell too curiously on the state of\r\nhis health and the state of his finances, might have added the bitter\r\nforetaste of want and privation to the actual difficulty of the moment.\r\nSuch reflections and such anticipations might sadden the hearts of those\r\nwho surrounded him, but Mr. Smith would have thought it unworthy of his\r\nresolved mind and firm trust in Providence, to have abated one jot of his\r\naccustomed cheerfulness, shortened one of the innumerable playful stories\r\nwhich were always springing to his lips from the rich treasure-house of\r\nhis memory, or turned his meditations from his favourite subjects.\r\n\r\nAt Sheffield, while slowly recovering the use of his limbs, he busied\r\nhimself in arranging a body of information which he had gathered\r\nconcerning the neighbouring coal districts; and on removing soon\r\nafterwards to his old quarters at Doncaster, he worked much on the large\r\n“Old Survey of Yorkshire,” thinking to complete the colouring of it. By\r\ndegrees he recovered entirely from his painful disorder, and from this\r\nyear (1825) to 1839, nothing of the kind ever affected him again.\r\n\r\nBut these years were fruitful of events interesting to the friends of\r\nWilliam Smith. In February, 1831, the Council of the Geological Society\r\nof London honoured him by awarding to him the first Wollaston medal; and\r\nthe terms with which the gift was accompanied render this act on the part\r\nof the society and the president extremely memorable. Dr. Wollaston’s\r\nservices to physical science were well known and duly honoured in his\r\nlifetime; geology has felt, and will long feel the benefit of his dying\r\nbequest. He invested one thousand pounds in the three per cent. Reduced\r\nBank Annuities, in the joint names of himself and the Geological Society,\r\nand directed that after his decease, “the society should apply the\r\ndividends in promoting researches concerning the mineral structure of the\r\nearth, or in rewarding those by whom such researches should hereafter\r\nbe made; or in such manner as should appear to the Council of the said\r\nsociety for the time being, conducive to the interests of the society\r\nin particular, or the science of geology in general.” He afterwards\r\nenjoined the society “not to hoard the dividends parsimoniously, but to\r\nexpend them liberally, and, as far as might be, annually, in furthering\r\nthe objects of the trust.” The first year’s income from this fund was\r\nappropriated to the acquisition of a die for a medal bearing the head of\r\nDr. Wollaston, and this having been undertaken by Mr. Wyon, the society\r\nwas prepared in 1831 to fulfil the trust with which they were charged.\r\nThe council accordingly passed unanimously the following resolutions,\r\nJan. 11, 1831:—\r\n\r\n“1. That a medal of fine gold, bearing the impress of the head of Dr.\r\nWollaston, and not exceeding the value of ten guineas, be procured with\r\nthe least possible delay.\r\n\r\n“2. That the first Wollaston medal be given to Mr. William Smith, in\r\nconsideration of his being a great original discoverer in English\r\ngeology; and especially for his having been the first, in this country,\r\nto discover and to teach the identification of strata, and to determine\r\ntheir succession by means of their imbedded fossils.”\r\n\r\nThe announcement of this award was made by a congenial spirit. The chair\r\nof the Geological Society was then filled by one of its most honoured\r\nmembers, an original thinker and faithful observer, well qualified\r\nto appreciate the originality of Mr. Smith’s discoveries, and well\r\nacquainted by actual research with their extent and their value. In his\r\naddress on this occasion, Professor Sedgwick, speaking in the name of\r\nthe Geological Society, sketched a brief but satisfactory history of\r\nMr. Smith’s career, demonstrated the entire justice of the award of the\r\nCouncil of the Geological Society, and added his personal testimony in\r\nfavour of Mr. Smith’s claims in terms of no ordinary value.\r\n\r\n“I for one can speak with gratitude of the practical lessons I have\r\nreceived from Mr. Smith. It was by tracking his footsteps, with his maps\r\nin my hand, through Wiltshire and the neighbouring counties, where he had\r\ntrodden nearly thirty years before, that I first learned the subdivisions\r\nof our oolitic series, and apprehended the meaning of those arbitrary and\r\nsomewhat uncouth terms, which we derive from him as our master, which\r\nhave long become engrafted into the conventional language of English\r\ngeologists, and through their influence have been, in part, also adopted\r\nby the naturalists of the continent.\r\n\r\n“After such a statement, gentlemen, I have a right to speak boldly, and\r\nto demand your approbation of the council’s award. I could almost dare\r\nto wish that stern lover of truth, to whose bounty we owe the “Donation\r\nFund,” that dark eye, before the glance of which all false pretensions\r\nwithered, were once more amongst us. And if it be denied us to hope that\r\na spirit like that of Wollaston should often be embodied on the earth, I\r\nwould appeal to those intelligent men who form the strength and ornament\r\nof this society, whether there was any place for doubt or hesitation?\r\nwhether we were not compelled, by every motive which the judgment can\r\napprove and the heart can sanction, to perform this act of filial duty,\r\nbefore we thought of the claims of any other man, and to place our first\r\nhonour on the brow of the father of English geology?\r\n\r\n“If, in the pride of our present strength, we were disposed to forget\r\nour origin, our very speech bewrays us: for we use the language which he\r\ntaught us in the infancy of our science. If we, by our united efforts,\r\nare chiselling the ornaments and slowly raising up the pinnacles of one\r\nof the temples of nature, it was he who gave the plan, and laid the\r\nfoundations, and erected a portion of the solid walls by the unassisted\r\nlabour of his hands.\r\n\r\n“The men who have led the way in useful discoveries, have ever held the\r\nfirst place of honour in the estimation of all who in after times have\r\nunderstood their works or trodden in their steps. It is upon this abiding\r\nprinciple that we have acted; and in awarding our first prize to Mr.\r\nSmith, we believe that we have done honour to our own body, and are\r\nsanctioned by the highest feelings which bind societies together.\r\n\r\n“I think it a high privilege to fill this chair on an occasion when we\r\nmet, not coldly to deliberate on the balance of conflicting claims, in\r\nwhich, after all, we might go wrong, and give the prize to one man by\r\ninjustice to another; but to perform a sacred duty, where there is no\r\nroom for doubt or error, and to perform an act of public gratitude, in\r\nwhich the judgment and the feelings are united.”[6]\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Mr. Smith presented to the society the original Table of\r\nStratification drawn in 1799, and a circle-map of the vicinity of Bath,\r\nwhich had been geologically coloured about the same period.\r\n\r\nThe British Association, founded at York in 1831, held its second meeting\r\nat Oxford in June, 1832; and on this occasion the Wollaston Medal,\r\nawarded in the previous year, was put in Mr. Smith’s possession; and he\r\nwas further gratified by the announcement that a pension of one hundred\r\npounds, solicited by the united voice of English geologists, had been\r\nassigned him by the Government of His Majesty William the Fourth.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the British Association was this year (1839) appointed to\r\nbe held at Birmingham, on the 26th of August, and Mr. Smith received\r\nfrom Mr. Joseph Hodgson (one of the secretaries of the meeting) a special\r\nand very cordial invitation to be present. He stopped on his journey to\r\nBirmingham, at the house of friends at Northampton. Here the kindest\r\nwelcome awaited him; and in addition to the pleasure of contemplating the\r\nbeautiful series of Northamptonshire fossils which had been collected, he\r\nwas gratified by several excursions into the neighbouring country, which\r\nhad always been interesting to him since, in earlier days, he had opened\r\nthe curious volume of Morton’s “Northamptonshire.” While thus tracing the\r\nboundaries of the minor divisions of the oolitic rocks which he had been\r\nthe first to distinguish, a slight cold by which he was affected seemed\r\nto the eyes of his friends, to deserve more attention than he bestowed on\r\nit; medical assistance became immediately advisable. William Smith had\r\nfor many years been successful in guarding his own usually robust health,\r\nand he was slow and reluctant to admit of advice better suited to the\r\ndisorder which now attacked him, and which on a former occasion had so\r\nprostrated his strength that he recovered with difficulty. He began to\r\nfeel the attack serious, and to perceive the alarm in the faces of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to believe, that under that calm, thoughtful, and\r\npleased expression of countenance, those animated descriptions of the\r\ncountry which he had visited a few days previously, those plans of\r\nfurther and strenuous exertion, which asked years of active life for\r\ncompletion, lurked pain and fatal disease. At first it seemed as if the\r\nremedies applied were producing beneficial effects, but this hope failed;\r\nthe uncomplaining sufferer sank continually in each succeeding hour, till\r\nhis eyes lost their bright and kindly light and the ever-varying features\r\nbecame fixed in serene and awful tranquility (Aug. 28, 1839).\r\n\r\nHis life, written by his distinguished relation the late Professor John\r\nPhillips, F.R.S. of Oxford, has been the source of these pages. William\r\nSmith’s portrait hangs in the most distinguished position, over the\r\npresident’s chair at the Geological Society of London. He was a great\r\ngenius, and suffered much toil and poverty, in order to produce the\r\ntruth; but he led a very happy life on the whole for his thoughts about\r\nnature were his great and good riches. He proved that there is a regular\r\nsuccession of strata which are characterized by their fossils, each\r\nstratum being the burial ground of its time of collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF MURCHISON.\r\n\r\n    The older rocks of the globe studied accurately and\r\n    surveyed—The general similarity of the succession of strata\r\n    in many parts of the world decided—The geology of Wales and\r\n    Scotland described—The commencement of accurate geological\r\n    surveys.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoderick Impey Murchison was the descendant of a very old Rossshire\r\nfamily, who were great supporters of the Stuarts in the wild western\r\ncountry of the north of Scotland. His great-grandfather fell at\r\nSheriffmuir, and his grandfather, a tenant farmer, had to struggle with\r\nslender means during a long life. But long before this fine old man died,\r\nat the age of ninety-nine, he saw the fortunes of his family retrieved by\r\nhis eldest son, whom he outlived.\r\n\r\nThis son, Roderick Impey Murchison’s father, was born in 1751, and,\r\nthanks to the cheap and good education which was to be got at Edinburgh\r\nand Glasgow, he became a surgeon. Passing the examination at the Royal\r\nCollege of Surgeons in England, the young man was sent out to India, and\r\nliving at Lucknow for seventeen years, made a fortune. He came home to\r\nthe old country, and bought the estate of Tarradale, in the eastern part\r\nof Ross, kept up the old Highland customs, and made himself useful as\r\na medical man when aid was required. He married, in 1791, the daughter\r\nof Mackenzie, of Fairburn, lineal representative of the Rory More, or\r\nBig Roderick Mackenzie, to whom the estates had been granted by James\r\nV. Their younger son, Roderick Impey was born in February, 1792, and\r\nwas reared by the “sonsie” miller’s wife of Tarradale, who hushed him\r\nto sleep with gaelic lullabies, and gave him an occasional taste of\r\nthe famous whiskey distilled on the adjacent lands of Ferrintosh. But\r\nthe father got delicate and moved to the south, carrying with him his\r\nhousehold. On the way an end nearly came to the future geologist, for\r\nhis father, wishing to make the boy “stand fire,” presented what was\r\nthought an empty pistol at him. The mother snatched the child away, and\r\ninstantly a charge of shot rattled through the window. The father died\r\nwhen Murchison was only four years of age, and the boy wrote in after\r\nyears his sad memory of the last of his father: “The opening of the red\r\ndamask curtains of the lofty old-fashioned bed, the last kiss of my dying\r\nparent, and the form of the old-fashioned edifice to which the invalid\r\nhad been removed, have been stereotyped in my mind.” The father was\r\nan accomplished gentleman, and the mother a young and attractive lady.\r\nA second marriage gave Murchison a good step-father in Colonel Robert\r\nMacgregor Murray, a friend of the deceased; but home life was broken up\r\nwhen the colonel was ordered off to Ireland during the rebellion. So\r\nMurchison was sent to the Durham Grammar School in 1799. He had a bitter\r\nparting from his mother and from Sally, the Devonshire lass, who gave him\r\nhis English accent, which he retained through life. Six years were passed\r\nat school, and he was as full of mischief as most boys; picking up at the\r\nsame time some of the so-called rudiments of learning.\r\n\r\nHe was ringleader in most of the exploits of the school, and during the\r\nholidays led a very active life with the assistance of his pony and\r\nterrier. One day his uncle told him that in due time he would make a good\r\nsoldier, and from that day Murchison read of nothing but military heroes.\r\n\r\nAt the early age of thirteen he was sent to the military college at Great\r\nMarlow, and, after one pluck, was admitted as cadet. There he became\r\nconspicuous as a daring leader of fun and frolic, and as a moderate\r\nstudent; nevertheless he was great at drill. A gift which decided in\r\nafter years much of his success was fostered at Great Marlow. His\r\nexercises in military drawing led to the future rapidity and correctness\r\nof his “eye” for “country” in geological surveying.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen years of age Murchison was gazetted as an ensign in the 36th\r\nregiment, and at Edinburgh he took lessons in French, Italian, German,\r\nand mathematics. He learned to ride and fence, and went in for debating.\r\nSo having, as he said, done so much in the way of having a good opinion\r\nof himself, he was ordered to join his regiment at Cork in the winter\r\nof 1807-8. He was wonderfully surprised to find the officers anything\r\nbut dandies, and, in fact, true old soldiers, quiet, well disciplined\r\nand associated with a first-rate fighting regiment. His chief, Colonel\r\nBurne, was a cool and gallant officer, and a favourite of Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley’s. In 1808 the regiment was prepared for service in South\r\nAmerica, and was suddenly ordered to Portugal, and on August 1st he\r\nlanded, and saw the future Wellington put his foot on Portuguese soil,\r\nfollowed by his aide-de-camp, the future Lord Raglan.\r\n\r\nA battle was soon to be fought, and at Vimiera.\r\n\r\nProfessor Geikie’s charming “Life of Murchison,” from which this\r\nlittle history is compiled, gives the following graphic description of\r\nMurchison’s first fight, at Vimiera:—\r\n\r\n“To return to our own part of the battle, _i.e._, to our left wing,\r\nthe fire of the enemy soon became very hot, and even though the 36th\r\nwere lying on their breasts under the brow, our men were getting pretty\r\nmuch hit, whilst the regiment in our rear, the 82nd, which at that time\r\ncould not fire a shot, suffered more than we did. General Spencer, who\r\ncommanded the division, when moving about to regulate the general\r\nmovements, was hit by a ball in the hand, and I saw him wrap his\r\nhandkerchief round it, and heard him say, ‘It is only a scratch!’ Soon\r\nafter the light infantry in our front closed files and fell in; our guns\r\nwe pulled back, and then came the struggle. General Ferguson waving his\r\nhat, up we rose, old Burne (our colonel) crying out, as he shook his\r\nyellow cane, that he would knock down any man who fired a shot.\r\n\r\n“This made some merriment among the men, as tumbling over was the fashion\r\nwithout the application of their colonel’s cane. “Charge,” was the word,\r\nand at once we went over the brow with a steady line of glittering steel,\r\nand with a hearty hurrah, against six regiments in close column, with six\r\npieces of artillery, just in front of the 36th. But not an instant did\r\nthe enemy stand against this most unexpected sally within pistol shot.\r\nOff they went, and all their guns were instantly taken, horses and all,\r\nand then left in our rear, whilst we went on chasing the runaways for\r\na mile and a half, as hard as we could go, over the moor of Tourinhâo.\r\nThey rallied, it is true, once or twice, particularly behind some thick\r\nprickly-pear hedges and a hut or two on the flat table-land; but although\r\ntheir brave General Solignac was always cantering to their front, and\r\nanimating them against us, they at last fled precipitately, until they\r\nreached a small hamlet, where, however, they did make a tolerable stand.\r\n\r\n“Here it was that Sir Arthur Wellesley overtook us after a smart gallop.\r\nHe had witnessed from a distance our steady and successful charge, and\r\nour capture of the guns, and he now saw how we were thrusting the French\r\nout of this hamlet. Through the sound of the musketry, and in the midst\r\nof much confusion, I heard a shrill voice calling out, ‘Where are the\r\ncolours of the 36th?’ and I turned round (my brother ensign, poor Peter\r\nBone, having just been knocked down), and looking up into Sir Arthur’s\r\nbright and confident face said, ‘Here they are, sir.’ Then he shouted,\r\n‘Very well done, my boys! Halt, halt—quite enough.’\r\n\r\n“The French were now at their last run, in spite of every effort of\r\nSolignac to rally them. Several of our bloody-minded old soldiers said in\r\nlevelling, ‘they would bring down the —— on the white horse,’ and sure\r\nenough the gallant fellow fell, just as the 71st Highlanders, who were\r\non our left, being moved round _en potence_, charged down the hill, with\r\ntheir wounded piper playing, sitting on the ground, and completed the\r\nrout of the enemy, taking General Solignac of course prisoner.”\r\n\r\nSubsequently Murchison’s regiment joined the expedition of Sir John\r\nMoore, and participated in the disastrous retreat upon Corunna.\r\n“Murchison (writes Professor Geikie) suffered much, although he was\r\nstrong and in good health, from the excessive fatigue. On one occasion,\r\nafter a fruitless midnight march against the enemy, who was supposed to\r\nbe advancing to the attack, Murchison, commanding that night an outlying\r\npicquet, threw himself into a corner of a farmer’s yard, and soon fell\r\nasleep. Day had scarcely broken when the cry of ‘Picquet, turn out!’\r\nroused him from his rest, but not in time to escape the notice of the\r\nvigilant Colonel Packe, who, however, allowed him to escape with a severe\r\nreprimand. But after the halt at Tugo, when having vainly offered battle\r\nto the French, the British army retreated by a forced march to Corunna,\r\nthe young lieutenant fairly broke down. The mule, which had hitherto\r\ncarried himself or his kit, was lost; his old soldier servant had gone\r\nback to seek among the snow for his wife and child.” Of this sad time\r\nhe has preserved the following recollections:—“Never shall I forget the\r\nnight which followed the abandoning of our position in front of Tugo.\r\nWe marched through that city at dusk, and then blew up the bridge,\r\nwhich was to check for awhile our foe. In darkness, with no food, and\r\nafter sleepless nights, with worn-out shoes, and thoroughly disgusted\r\nwith always running off and not fighting, this army now fell into utter\r\ndisorder. Starved as they were, the men soon became reckless, and all the\r\nregiments got mixed together; in short, the soldiers were desperate, in\r\nspite of the exertions of the few mounted officers. For my own part, I\r\nwalked on, usually in my sleep, with the grumbling and tumultuous mass,\r\nuntil awakened by the loss of my boots in one of the numerous deep cuts\r\nacross the roads, which were like quagmires, so that with my bare feet I\r\nhad some twenty miles still to march. Many of the soldiers got away from\r\nthe road to right and left. Marching all that dreadful night my young\r\nframe at last gave way, the more so as I was barefoot, cold, and starved,\r\nand already the great body of troops had got ahead of me. In short, I\r\nwas now one of a huge arrear of stragglers when day broke and the little\r\nhamlet was in sight.\r\n\r\n“Seated on a bank on the side of the road, and munching a raw turnip\r\nwhich I had gathered from the adjacent field, and just as I was feeling\r\nthat I never could regain my regiment and must be taken a prisoner, a\r\nblack-eyed drummer of the 96th came from the village, whither the young\r\nfellow had been to cater. Seeing I was exhausted, and almost as young as\r\nmyself, and not yet a hardened old soldier, he slipped round his canteen,\r\nwhich he had contrived to fill with red wine, and gave me a hearty drink.\r\nHe thus saved me from being taken prisoner by the French, who were\r\nrapidly advancing, and who, if they had had a regiment of cavalry in\r\npursuit, might at that moment have taken prisoners, or driven into the\r\nmountains, a good third of the British forces.\r\n\r\n“With the draught of wine I trudged on again, and came in, at eleven\r\no’clock of the 10th, into the town of Betanzos, and rejoined my regiment,\r\nwhich had marched in about fifty men only, with the colours, though ere\r\nnight it was made up to its strength of six hundred and odd men. This\r\nfact alone shows better than a world of other evidence, what forced\r\nnight-marches with a starving and retreating army must infallibly\r\nproduce. At Tugo the 36th regiment was fit to fight anything; in two days\r\nit was a rabble.\r\n\r\n“Happily for me I tumbled into a shoemaker’s house. His handsome young\r\nwife washed my feet with warm water, and furnished me with stockings,\r\nwhile her husband came to my further aid with shoes. But my swollen feet\r\nhad no time to recover. On the following day the whole army, such as it\r\nwas, passed over the river, blowing up the bridge and taking up its last\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“There, remnant as it was, the army formed a respectable line—Corunna\r\nwithin two miles of us, and our fleet ready to back us. Provisions and\r\nshoes were served out to us, and with such luxuries the bivouac, even\r\nin the month of January, was well borne. In truth, the army got into\r\ncomparative good spirits, and on the 15th the French crossed the last\r\nbridge we had blown up, and were defiling at a respectable distance\r\nalong our front. We were quite refreshed, and ready to repel them. The\r\npicquets, indeed, of our (Hope’s) division had a sharp encounter in that\r\nevening, and when looking through the colonel’s glass, I saw Colonel\r\nMackenzie, of the 5th regiment, fall dead from his grey horse whilst\r\nleading an attack on two of the enemy’s guns.\r\n\r\n“On the 16th, just after our frugal repast, and whilst leaning over one\r\nof the walls where we lay, my old colonel, after looking some time with\r\nhis glass, suddenly exclaimed to me, ‘Now, my boy, they’re coming on;’\r\nand when I took a peep to the hills beyond on the right and south-west, I\r\nperceived the glitter of columns coming out of a wood. Scarcely had the\r\ncolonel given the word to fall in, when a tremendous fire opened from a\r\nbattery of seventeen to twenty pieces, under cover of which the enemy\r\nwas rolling down in dense columns from the wooded hills upon our poor\r\nfellows, who were in a hollow with their arms piled, like our own, until\r\nthey were assaulted.\r\n\r\n“For our cavalry was extinct, as the horses and men, as well as most\r\nof our artillery, were embarked on the 13th and 14th; yet never since\r\nEnglishmen fought was there a more gallant fight than was made by the\r\n4th, 42nd, and 50th regiments (Lord W. Bentinck’s brigade), who rushed\r\non with the bayonet, and, supported by guards, held their own against a\r\nterrific superiority, until General Paget was ordered to move his brigade\r\ntowards the enemy’s flank, and compelled them to withdraw; not, however,\r\nbefore poor Moore, galloping out from the town, fell while encouraging\r\nthe troops, and Baird, who marched his division out of the town, had lost\r\nhis arm. My own brigade had much less to do, our front line and picquets\r\nbeing alone engaged.\r\n\r\n“As night fell, and after the firing had ceased, the enemy having\r\nreturned to his own ground, we received the order to march into Corunna\r\nand embark. Our fires were left burning to deceive the enemy, and make\r\nhim believe that he must fight us again next morning if he hoped to beat\r\nus.\r\n\r\n“Silently and regularly we moved on this our last short night-march in\r\nthe dark, tranquil night of the 16th, and, passing through the gates,\r\nreached the quay. The names of our respective transports had previously\r\nbeen explained to us, my own being the brig _Reward_, which I found to\r\nbe from Sunderland. I was on deck as light dawned, and then at once saw\r\nthe danger of the position of this miserable little transport, as well\r\nas of a dozen or more of the same craft. They had been foolishly allowed\r\nto anchor immediately under the tongue of high land which forms the\r\neastern side of the harbour, and on which there were no land defences.\r\nKnowing that this ground was only a continuation of the hilly track on\r\nwhich my division had marched a few hours before, and being certain that\r\nthe French would with the peep of day pass over our old bivouac to this\r\npromontory, I at once urged our skipper to get up his anchor betimes. But\r\nthe grog had, I suppose, been strong that night. He exclaimed, ‘Why, I\r\ntell you, the brave Highlanders are there; they have not come away like\r\nyou folks.’ Scarcely had he spoken when a battery of field-pieces opened\r\ntheir fire and sent some balls through our rigging. Turning pale as death\r\nunder the fire of these mere field-pieces, and seeing that his crew were\r\nready to run below, he applied the axe to the cable, and in a few minutes\r\nwe were drifting away as we best could. The wind being from the east, we\r\nwere fast approaching the rocks on which the Castle of Antonio stands,\r\nand on which at least five transports similarly circumstanced to my own\r\nwere wrecked, the men being saved with difficulty, after losing their\r\narms, colours, and baggage.\r\n\r\n“I have often reflected on the extraordinary want of all due arrangement\r\non the part of our admiral, in command of a splendid fleet, who allowed\r\nthose miserable transports to anchor in such a position without placing\r\na frigate or two near them to silence the puny battery and prevent the\r\ndismay which seized the skippers.\r\n\r\n“Not missing stays, the _Reward_ floated away, and was soon going fast\r\nbefore a strong nor’-easter, with the rest of the fleet helter-skelter\r\nfor the Channel.”\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Murchison met Charlotte Hugouin, the daughter of General Hugouin,\r\nand as she was attractive, piquante, clever, and highly educated, she\r\nmade a conquest of the gallant soldier. They were soon married, at\r\nBuriton, in Hampshire.\r\n\r\nHitherto he had lived at his own free will. From this time he came under\r\nthe influence of a thoughtful, cultivated, and affectionate woman.\r\nQuietly and imperceptibly that influence grew, and she led him, with\r\ntrue womanly tact, into a sphere of exertion where his uncommon powers\r\nmight find full scope. To his wife he owed his fame, as he never failed\r\ngratefully to record; but years had to pass before her guidance had\r\naccomplished what she had set before her as her aim.\r\n\r\nTired of the army, and possessing a great amount of energy and physical\r\npower, Murchison longed for a profession, and at one time seriously\r\ncontemplated entering the Church. But money was scarce, and he went\r\nwith his wife to live economically in Italy. This was an epoch in his\r\nlife, and he went by way of Paris, and there he heard Cuvier lecture.\r\nAt Geneva he met De Candolle, and as his wife had relatives at Vevay,\r\nthey spent some time there, and Murchison began taking walking tours.\r\nOn one occasion he walked four hundred and thirty-two miles over\r\nmountain ground, in fourteen days, finishing with a last day’s walk of\r\nthirty-seven miles. In another excursion to Mont Blanc he walked one\r\nhundred and twenty miles in three days. This was characteristic of the\r\nman. But it was not simple exercise that he took, for his retentive\r\nmemory and eye for landscape were occupied; and such walks always\r\nproduced good results in after years.\r\n\r\nArrived at Rome they went into lodgings, and Murchison became a confirmed\r\nvisitor of galleries, museums, and churches. Then Mrs. Murchison fell\r\nill, and they went, on her recovery, to Naples, where, of course,\r\nVesuvius was seen, but oddly enough, his written impressions of the scene\r\ndo not tell of any geological tastes. Two years glided away, and they\r\nfounded his intellectual life, and impressed him that it was better than\r\ngaiety. When returned to England, Murchison sold his Scotch estate and\r\nwent to live in a most out of the way old mansion at Barnard Castle,\r\nin Durham. Then there was no art, and therefore Murchison became a\r\nsportsman, and for five years rode as hard and as well to the front as\r\nany of his fox-hunting friends. Every now and then some intellectual\r\nsociety was enjoyed at some of the great houses of the neighbourhood, and\r\nMurchison made the acquaintance of Sir Humphrey Davy. Mrs. Murchison did\r\nnot care about the everlasting hunting, and tried, in her wise manner,\r\nto wean him from the purposeless life he was leading. She knew botany,\r\nand tried to interest her husband in it, but he did not care for it;\r\nthen she tried to learn mineralogy to get him to help her. But Murchison\r\ngot deeper and deeper into the love of field sports, and took a house\r\nat Melton Mowbray and hunted six days in the week. Murchison got tired\r\nat last, and having met Sir Humphrey Davy again, was advised by him to\r\ninterest himself about chemistry. So Murchison sold his horses and gave\r\nup his establishment, really intending to settle in London. But probably\r\nwant of means prevented his having an establishment in the West End at\r\nfirst, so he led a less active but still sporting life in the south of\r\nScotland for some time.\r\n\r\nMurchison was now to change his method of life completely, and the summer\r\nof 1824 saw the last of his rambles, wherever the rocks around him\r\nmade no direct and urgent appeal to him. Bringing his wife to London,\r\nthey rented a house in Montague Place, and Murchison began to attend\r\nscientific lectures, and especially those on geology, which was at that\r\ntime much talked about. Hutton’s admirable views of the causes of the\r\nchanges on the surface of the earth, and their possible comparison with\r\nthose of the present day, was making progress, but was still antagonized\r\nby the notions of sudden convulsions and great underground movements. He\r\nwent to the Geological Society, a young and ardent one, which had sprung\r\ninto active work in spite of the opposition of the nursing mother of\r\nscience, the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nWith hearing lectures on science, scientific papers and discussions,\r\nattending evening soirées, and the opportunity of hearing and talking to\r\nmen who had already made themselves famous, Murchison found enough fully\r\nto fill up his time, and to make London life a very different thing to\r\nhim from what it had been in the old days, when he used to escape to town\r\nfrom the monotony of a country barrack. With his characteristic ardour,\r\nhe had not completed his first winter’s studies in geology before he\r\nlonged to be off into the field to observe for himself.\r\n\r\n“My first real field work,” he says, “began under Professor Buckland,\r\nwho having taken a fancy to me as one of his apt scholars, invited me to\r\nvisit him at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and attend one or two of his\r\nlectures. This was my true launch. Travelling down with him in the Oxford\r\ncoach, I learned a world of things before we reached the Isis, and,\r\namongst other things, I enjoyed a lecture on crustacea, given whilst he\r\npulled to pieces on his knees, a cold crab, bought at a fishmonger’s shop\r\nat Maidenhead, where he usually lunched as the coach stopped.\r\n\r\n“On repairing from the Star inn to Buckland’s domicile, I never can\r\nforget the scene which awaited me. Having, by direction of the janitor,\r\nclimbed up a narrow staircase, I entered a long corridor-like room (now\r\nall destroyed), which was filled with rocks, shells, and bones in dire\r\nconfusion, and, in a sort of sanctum at the end was my friend, in his\r\nblack gown, looking like a necromancer, sitting on the sole rickety chair\r\nnot covered with some fossils, and cleaning out a fossil bone from the\r\nmatrix.”\r\n\r\nThe few days spent at Oxford were memorably pleasant. Buckland’s wit\r\nand enthusiasm glowed all his scientific sayings and doings, and he had\r\na rare power of description, by which he could make even a dry enough\r\nsubject fascinatingly interesting. Murchison heard one or two brilliant\r\nlectures from him, but what was of still more importance, he accompanied\r\nthe merry professor and his students, mounted on Oxford hacks, to\r\nShotover Hill, and for the first time in his life had a landscape\r\ngeologically dissected before him. From that eminence his eye was taught\r\nto recognize the broader features of the succession of the oolitic rocks\r\nof England up to the far range of the Chalk Hills, and this not in a\r\ndull, text-book fashion, for Buckland, in luminous language, brought the\r\nseveral elements of the landscape into connection with each other, and\r\nwith a few fundamental principles which have determined the sculpturing\r\nof the earth’s surface. His audience came to see merely a rich vale in\r\nthe midst of fertile England, but before they quitted the ground, the\r\nlandscape had been made to yield up to them, clear notions of the origin\r\nof springs and the principles of drainage. This was the very kind of\r\ninstruction needed to fan the growing flame of Murchison’s zeal for\r\nscience. He returned to town burning with desire to put his knowledge to\r\nsome use by trying to imitate, no matter how feebly, the admirable way in\r\nwhich the Oxford professor had applied the lessons of the lecture-room to\r\nthe elucidation of the history of hills and valleys.\r\n\r\nMurchison started with his wife in the middle of August, on a tour of\r\nnine weeks along the south coast, from the Isle of Wight into Devon\r\nand Cornwall. Taking a light carriage and a pair of horses, he made\r\nthe journey in short stages, lingering for days at some of the more\r\ninteresting or important geological localities. Driving, boating,\r\nwalking, or scrambling, the enthusiastic pair signalized their first\r\ngeological tour by a formidable amount of bodily toil.\r\n\r\nMrs. Murchison specially devoted herself to the collection of fossils,\r\nand to sketching the more striking geological features of the coast-line,\r\nwhile her husband would push on to make some long and laborious detour.\r\nIn this way, while she remained quietly working at Lyme Regis, he struck\r\nwestward for a fortnight into Devon and Cornwall, to make his first\r\nacquaintance with the rocks to which, in after years, Sedgwick and he\r\nwere to give the name by which they are now recognized all over the\r\nworld. It was in the course of this tour that he met with a man, whom\r\nhe has the merit of having brought into notice, and who certainly amply\r\nrequited him by the services rendered in later years. William Lonsdale\r\nhad served in the Peninsular war, and retired on half-pay to Bath. With\r\nthe most simple and abstemious habits, his slender income sufficed\r\nnot only for his wants, but for the purchase of any book or fossil he\r\ncoveted, and so he spent his time in studying the organic remains, and\r\nespecially the fossil corals, to be found in his neighbourhood. Murchison\r\nmet him accidentally in some quarries, “a tall, grave man, with a huge\r\nhammer on his shoulder,” and found him so full of information, that he\r\nstayed some days at Bath under Lonsdale’s guidance.\r\n\r\nWith the enlargement of view which so instructive a ramble had given\r\nhim, Murchison prepared and read to the Geological Society, on 16th\r\nDecember, 1825, his first scientific paper—“A Geological Sketch of the\r\nNorth-western Extremity of Sussex, and the adjoining parts of Hants and\r\nSurrey.” This little essay bore manifest evidence of being the result\r\nof careful observation of the order of succession of the rocks in the\r\nfield, followed by as ample examination of their fossils as he could\r\nsecure, from those best qualified to give an opinion upon them. In these\r\nrespects it was typical of all his later work. Having shown by this first\r\npublication his capacity as observer and describer, and being further\r\nrecommended by the leisure which his position of independence enabled him\r\nto command, he was soon after elected one of the two honorary secretaries\r\nof the Geological Society. “Lyell being then a law-student, with chambers\r\nin the Temple, could only devote a portion of his time to our science,\r\nand was glad to make way as secretary to one who, like myself, had\r\nnothing else to do than think and dream of geology, and work hard to get\r\non in my new vocation.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1826 he was elected into the Royal Society—an honour\r\nmore easily won then than now, and for which, as the President, his old\r\nfriend Sir Humphry Davy told him, he was indebted, not to the amount or\r\nvalue of his scientific work, but to the fact that he was an independent\r\ngentleman, having a taste for science, with plenty of time, and enough of\r\nmoney to gratify it.\r\n\r\nMurchison next investigated, at the instance of Dr. Buckland, the\r\ngeological age of the Brora coalfield, in Sutherlandshire. Some\r\ngeologists maintained that the rocks of that district were merely a part\r\nof the ordinary coal, or carboniferous system; others held them to be\r\ngreatly younger, to be, indeed, of the same general age with the lower\r\noolitic strata of Yorkshire. A good observer might readily settle this\r\nquestion; Murchison resolved to try.\r\n\r\nAgain he prepared himself by reading and study of fossils to understand\r\nthe evidence he was to collect and interpret, and in order to do full\r\njustice to the Scottish tract, he went first to the Yorkshire coast, and\r\nmade himself master of the succession, and leading characters of the\r\nrocks so admirably displayed along that picturesque line of cliffs. The\r\nsummer had hardly begun before he and his wife broke up their camp in\r\nLondon and were on the move northwards. At York he made the acquaintance\r\nof two men, with whom he was destined in after life to have much close\r\nintercourse and co-operation—the Rev. William Vernon (afterwards Vernon\r\nHarcourt) and Mr. (subsequently Professor) John Phillips.\r\n\r\nMurchison’s own record of the meeting is as follows:—“Phillips, then a\r\nyouth, was engaged in arranging a small museum at York. He recommended\r\nMurchison strongly to his uncle, William Smith, who was then living at\r\nScarborough, and had little intercourse with the Geological Society. From\r\nthe moment I had my first walk with William Smith (then about sixty years\r\nold), I felt that he was just the man after my own heart; and he, on his\r\npart, seeing that I had, as he said, ‘an eye for a country,’ took to me,\r\nand gave me most valuable lessons. Thus he made me thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith all the strata north and south of Scarborough. He afterwards\r\naccompanied me in a boat all along the coast, stopping and sleeping at\r\nRobin Hood’s Bay. Not only did I then learn the exact position of the\r\nbeds of poor coal which crop out in that tract of the eastern moorlands,\r\nbut collecting with him the characteristic fossils from the calcareous\r\ngrit down to the lias, I saw how clearly strata must alone be identified\r\nby their fossils, inasmuch as here, instead of oolite limestone like\r\nthose of the south we had sandstones, grits, and shales which, though\r\nclosely resembling the beds of the old coal, were precise equivalents of\r\nthe oolitic series of the south. Smith walked about stoutly with me all\r\nunder the cliffs from Robin Hood’s Bay to Whitby, making me well note the\r\ncharacteristic fossils of each formation.”\r\n\r\nThough the main object of this summer tour was to work out the geological\r\nproblem which had been assigned to him in Sutherlandshire, he sketched\r\na most circuitous route, partly for the sake of showing Mrs. Murchison\r\nsomething more of the Highlands than she had yet seen, and partly with\r\nthe view of putting to use his new acquirements in geology; so that after\r\nreaching Edinburgh, and having its geology expounded to him by Jameson,\r\ninstead of striking north at once, he turned westwards to the island of\r\nArran, and spent many weeks among the western islands from the Firth\r\nof Clyde to the north of Skye. The hills of his native country had now\r\nacquired an interest for him which they never possessed even in the days\r\nwhen they drew him off in eager pursuit of grouse and black cock. At\r\nevery halt his first anxiety was to know what the rocks of the place\r\nmight be, and how far he could identify their geological position. In\r\nArran he filled his notebook with observations and queries about granite,\r\nred sandstone, limestone, and other puzzling matters, on which his\r\nprevious experience in fieldwork in the south of England and in Yorkshire\r\ncould throw no light, and for the elucidation of which he wisely resolved\r\nto secure, at some future time, the guidance and co-operation of an older\r\ngeologist than himself. It was in the fulfilment of this resolution that\r\nSedgwick and he first became fellow-workers in the field.\r\n\r\nIn the wildest of the western islands he and his wife did excellent work\r\nin collecting fossils, and thereby obtaining materials for making more\r\ndetailed comparison between the secondary rocks of the west of Scotland\r\nand those of England than had been attempted by Dr. Macculloch. The\r\nactual fossil-hunting was mainly done by Mrs. Murchison, after whom one\r\nof the shells (_Ammonites Murchisoniæ_) was named by Sowerby, while her\r\nhusband climbed the cliffs and trudged over the moors and crags, to make\r\nout the order of succession among the secondary strata. But the tour was\r\nnot merely geological; many a halt and detour were made to get a good\r\nview of some fine scenery, or to make yet another sketch. Friends and\r\nhighland cousins, too, were plentifully scattered along the route, so\r\nthat the travellers had ample experience of the hearty hospitality of\r\nthose regions. An occasional shot at grouse or deer, varied the monotony\r\nof the hammering; but even when stalking, Murchison could not keep his\r\neyes from the rocks. Amid the jottings of his sport he had facts to\r\nchronicle about the gneiss or porphyry or sandstone through which the\r\nsport had led him. This characteristic, traceable even at this early\r\nperiod of his life, remained prominent up to the last autumn of his life\r\nin which he was able to wield a gun or hammer.\r\n\r\nThe summer had in great part passed before he reached that part of the\r\neastern coast of Sutherlandshire where the scene of his special task\r\nlay; but that task proved to be eminently easy. From Dunrobin, where he\r\nwas hospitably entertained, he could follow northwards and southwards a\r\nregular succession of strata, and he recognized in them the equivalents\r\nof parts of the oolite series of Yorkshire. The Brora coal, therefore,\r\ninstead of forming part of the true carboniferous system, was simply a\r\nlocal peculiarity in the oolitic series. He made a collection of the\r\nfossils, which offered a means of satisfactory comparison with the\r\noolitic rocks of England.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which this piece of work could be done left time for a\r\nprolongation of the tour northwards through Caithness, even up into the\r\nOrkney Islands, but at length the tourists had to prepare for a southward\r\nmigration again. Reaching Inverness, they turned eastward to Aberdeen,\r\nand thence down the eastern coast by Peterhead, by Buller’s of Buchan,\r\nArbroath, and St. Andrews. The immediate result of this summer’s work was\r\nseen in the preparation of a paper for the Geological Society.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sedgwick had already distinguished himself in the difficult\r\nlabour of unravelling the structure of some of the older rocks, and\r\nMurchison suggested that they should visit Scotland and examine and\r\ndescribe part of the country together. They desired to ascertain if\r\npossible the position and general relations of the Old Red sandstone.\r\nThis journey, intensely amusing in its anecdotes, led to much united work\r\nand good fellowship.\r\n\r\nHaving learned the principles of the science, Murchison went to study\r\ngeology in the field on the continent. Accompanied by Mrs. Murchison, he\r\nvisited the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne, the South of France and Italy,\r\nand finally Germany. Next year the Alps were explored, and subsequently\r\nAustria. At Vienna, Murchison indulged a little in what he always liked,\r\nand which did good to science, good society, and then started for Styria,\r\nand got much puzzled about the rocks and fossils at Gosau. On his return\r\nto England Murchison became secretary to the Geological Society, and\r\nheld the position for five years, and then he became the president of\r\nthe society. Subsequently he began seriously to attempt the description\r\nof the geology of Wales which ended in the establishment of the Silurian\r\nsystem of rocks. Then the Devonian and old red sandstones were\r\nconsidered, and the merits of the paleontologist, Lonsdale, who really\r\nestablished the great geological division of the Devonian, were fully\r\nconceded. About this time Murchison and his wife settled in the well\r\nknown mansion in Belgrave Square, which was such a home for scientific\r\nmen, British and foreign, for many a long year to come.\r\n\r\nRussia was the next country to be explored, and Murchison spent a long\r\nand very pleasant time there; and his description of the Ural Mountains\r\nwas of great importance. He was the first to sketch out broadly the\r\ngeological construction of that very monotonous country, and to point\r\nout the existence there of a formation which covers the coal-bearing\r\nrocks of England, and which he called the Permian. Returning to England,\r\nafter receiving the thanks of the Emperor Nicholas, Murchison again\r\nbecame President of the Geological Society, and with increased experience\r\nendeavoured to work out more fully than before, the old rocks of Wales,\r\nwhich he and Sedgwick had laboured over in common. Murchison and\r\nSedgwick, however, began at this time to misunderstand one another, and\r\nthose admirable men, the one having recognized the higher strata, and\r\nthe other the lower, began to differ regarding the line of separation\r\nof their work. It is an unsettled point even at the present day,\r\nnotwithstanding all the knowledge that these great men have left to us,\r\nand all that has come to science since their time. Ever enthusiastic in\r\nthe cause of science as he had been in war and in the field, Murchison\r\nallowed himself no rest, but started for Germany _via_ France to\r\nexamine the red sands and clays in those countries which, overlying the\r\ncarboniferous formation, resemble in position the Permian of Russia. The\r\ngeologist was treated like a prince by kings, emperors, and a host of\r\ntitled people who were glad to welcome the perfect gentleman so full of\r\ngood genial temper and amiability.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Murchison did not forget the British Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, with which he was officially connected. In 1843\r\nhe began to interest himself in the then little Geographical Society,\r\nwhich had been founded in 1830, chiefly by members of the Rayleigh\r\nTravellers’ club. Murchison was chosen its president, and he read an\r\naddress to the fellows in 1844. This society, now of great utility to\r\nscience and civilization, was fostered mainly by Murchison, and passed\r\nthrough years of steady progress under his management. In the same year,\r\nour geologist visited Scandinavia, where he found science more honoured\r\nthan anywhere else on earth, and went on to St. Petersburg. Returning\r\nto England, Murchison and his fellow labourers, Von Keyserling and De\r\nVerneuil, published the great work on “Russia, and the Ural Mountains,”\r\nand our hero became a recognized pillar in geological science.\r\n\r\nKnowing the geology of the Ural Mountains thoroughly, and having paid\r\nmuch attention to those parts of them where gold is found, Murchison was\r\nimpressed, when he read of the nature of the Australian Alps, that they\r\nought to be auriferous. In 1845, and 1846, Murchison spoke and wrote on\r\nthis subject, and kept on directing the attention of the colonists to\r\nthe necessity of searching for the precious mineral. In 1846 Murchison\r\nadvised the unemployed tin miners of Cornwall to emigrate and dig for\r\ngold in Australia. In 1847 a Mr. W. T. Smith, of Sydney, acquainted\r\nMurchison that he had discovered gold, and a Mr. Phillips, of Adelaide,\r\nwrote announcing the same fact. Finally, in 1848, Murchison impressed\r\non Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for the colonies the necessity of\r\nhaving Australia surveyed, for the purpose of gold finding. Three years\r\nafterwards a Mr. Hargraves came forward as the real Simon pure, and\r\nwas acknowledged by the ignorant legislature of New South Wales as the\r\ndiscoverer of gold in Australia. Count Strzelecki, a geologist, sent\r\nMurchison specimens of rocks from Australia, and positively found gold,\r\nnot by inference, as in Murchison’s case, but in reality. But at the\r\nrequest of the colonial authorities it was kept a secret!!! The Rev. W.\r\nB. Clarke, F.R.S., a capital geologist, found gold in places, and settled\r\nwhat rocks it was in. This was in 1841. So that Murchison, although not\r\nthe first discoverer, or the first who inferred the existence of gold in\r\nthe Australian rocks, must have great credit given to him.\r\n\r\nTwenty years had passed away since Murchison sold his horses and gave\r\nup fox hunting, and he had done more than any man to establish the\r\ngrand features of the outside structure of the earth, and to prove the\r\nsuccession everywhere of the same great formations. He was knighted in\r\n1846, an honour which was appreciated in those days, but which is not\r\ncompatible with the proper simplicity and nobility of science at the\r\npresent time. Everybody was glad of the honour being given, and received\r\nby Murchison, and “Sir Roderick,” for the future came as aptly to the\r\nthoughts of his friends as “Mr. Murchison” had done of old. There is\r\nno doubt that at this time this experienced geologist believed that\r\ngreat lapses of time had occurred, involving great distinctions and\r\nnew creations between the successive geological formations, that great\r\nchanges had happened, universally, in the physical geography of the land\r\nand sea before a new formation was produced, and that the vast majority\r\nof fossils found in one were not recognized in a succeeding formation.\r\nHe believed much in grand and sudden catastrophic changes in nature. The\r\npresidency of the British Association was given to the new scientific\r\nknight, and he worthily occupied the chair at the meeting at Southampton\r\nin 1846.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, the year of revolution in Europe, Murchison enjoyed foreign\r\npolitics and Alpine geology, and made the acquaintance of most of the\r\nyoung Swiss geologists, whose names are now so celebrated. An essay on\r\nthe geology of the Alps was written, and our hero received the Copley\r\nMedal of the Royal Society. But the many years of close and hard work\r\nhad told even on Murchison’s iron frame; and his wife was an invalid.\r\nSo they spent the summer of 1849 at Buxton, much to the disgust of the\r\ngeologist, however. He attended the meeting of the British Association\r\nat Birmingham, however, and relapsed into a state of perpetual “liver,”\r\nsuppressed gout and “stomach attacks.” After awhile the invalid went\r\nabroad and enjoyed rambling over the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne,\r\nand had his trip over the same ground twenty-two years before, brought\r\nbefore his mind. But he did not accept the theories of Lyell about the\r\nformation of the valleys and the denudation of the district. He stuck,\r\nunfortunately, to the violent in nature, and dismissed the truth of\r\nthe former uniform and slow action of the same forces as now prevail,\r\nfrom his mind. In the next year Murchison was happy again with his old\r\nfriend Sedgwick, and they geologized in the highlands, and enjoyed the\r\nhospitality of the young Duke and Duchess of Argyll. Then the southern\r\nuplands of Scotland were examined; and Murchison, stimulated by the great\r\nprogress of the writings of Lyell, came out in strong opposition to the\r\nHuttonian philosophy. Murchison contended in favour of great oscillations\r\nand ruptures of the earth’s crust leading to the sudden breaking up and\r\nsubmergence of tracts of land; but he did not explain how all this took\r\nplace or could take place. He believed in many superficial deposits, such\r\nas drift, being the product of violent convulsions and floods. His frame\r\nof mind was not difficult to account for. He had found, in investigating\r\nthe Alps, that movements amongst the strata had occurred on a vast scale,\r\nand that whole series of them, hundreds of feet thick, had not only\r\nbeen bent, but positively turned upside down. In 1851 Murchison visited\r\nIreland, and geologized there, and gradually began to complete his great\r\nwork, entitled “Siluria; or a Description of the Geology of the Silurian\r\nRocks of the World and of their Fossils.” This was published in 1854. The\r\nnext great act of Murchison’s was the assisting and promoting the success\r\nof the geological survey of the United Kingdom, and the establishment of\r\nthe museum in Jermyn Street. This led to the establishment of the Royal\r\nSchool of Mines. Murchison became the director of the survey, and went\r\ninto the subject with heart and soul, and found himself surrounded by the\r\nmost distinguished teachers in England.\r\n\r\nMurchison worked personally at the Scottish rocks from 1855 to 1858, and\r\nit is a matter of interest that at the present day his admirable work\r\nrelating to the order of the older rocks is a vexed question. In 1860,\r\nMurchison went to the highlands for the fourth time, and came to the same\r\nconclusions as before.\r\n\r\nYear after year the grand old man laboured on for the benefit of the\r\nsciences of geology and geography, and kept the geological survey in\r\ncapital order. He obtained the sanction of the Government for colonial\r\nsurveys, and was, in fact, the main stay of science in relation to the\r\nstate. For ten years he did all this, and occasionally indulged in a\r\ntrip to the north and west, and also into Bohemia. In 1862, Murchison\r\nwas terribly troubled by the sudden ill-health of his wife, to whom he\r\nowed so much. She became more and more of an invalid, and died in 1869.\r\nIt was the greatest blow possible, and it brought the kindest letter\r\nfrom his old friend Sedgwick, eighty-four years of age. In September,\r\n1870, Murchison’s time was coming to an end. A slight attack of paralysis\r\nwarned him to retire from active life. In the spring of 1871 he prepared\r\nhis last address as president of the Royal Geographical Society, and\r\nresigned the chair he had so ably filled for fifteen years. He lingered\r\non, and passed quietly away on October 22nd, 1871, full of years and\r\nwell merited honours. Murchison’s name will live for ever as a clear,\r\nkeen-eyed, careful observer of nature, and as a master of the facts\r\nrelating to much of the ancient history of the earth. He was a great\r\nstimulator of men of science, assisted the weak, and helped the good\r\nworker. He had a great personal character, religious, honest, truthful,\r\nopen and generous; he was a gentleman indeed. His biographer, Professor\r\nA. Geikie, F.R.S., whose most charming book has been so freely quoted\r\nby me, writes about his good old friend as follows: “A man’s face and\r\nfigure afford usually a good indication of the general calibre of the\r\nspirit which lodges beneath them. The picture which rises to the mind\r\nwhen one thinks of Murchison, is that of a tall, wiry, muscular frame,\r\nwhich still kept its erectness even under the burden of almost fourscore\r\nyears. It seemed the type of body for an active geologist, who had to win\r\nhis reputation by dint of hard climbing and walking, almost as much as by\r\nmental power. It was, moreover, united in his case with a certain pomp\r\nand dignity of manner, which at one time recalled the military training\r\nof the Peninsula days, at another the formal courtesy of the well-bred\r\ngentleman of a bygone generation.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF LYELL.\r\n\r\n    The study of existing nature and its changes undertaken in\r\n    order to comprehend the past changes during geological ages—The\r\n    uniformity of natural operations under law—Catastrophes\r\n    abolished—The succession of life on the globe, and that of the\r\n    tertiary ages explained—The antiquity of man and of the great\r\n    ice age considered.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Lyell was born in Forfarshire, at Kinnordy, on November 14th,\r\n1797. His father was an able, wealthy, well-educated gentleman; and his\r\nmother, a Yorkshire lady, had the usual good sound sense of the women of\r\nthat county. He was the eldest of ten children, the whole of whom grew\r\nup; and he, as is commonly the case in large families, was a good son and\r\nbrother, and a most independent man in mind and action.\r\n\r\nCharles Lyell’s family resided, for years, in the south of England after\r\nhis birth, and the boy was sent to school early; and in his amusing\r\nhistory of his schoolboy days, which is given in the “Life of Sir Charles\r\nLyell,” edited by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Lyell, he went through all\r\nthe fun and trouble, the games by day and the bolsterings by night, the\r\nkeeping of pets, and the petty warfares of the English schoolboy. When\r\neleven years of age, Lyell got into indifferent health at school after\r\nmeasles, and this necessitated his being less pressed at his lessons. He\r\nwas fond of study, however, and this enforced idleness made him take to\r\nsome of his father’s amusements, that of entomology.\r\n\r\nYoung Lyell studied butterflies, and chased them in the fields and\r\nwoodlands of the New Forest in Hampshire. He soon began to study the\r\nchanges of form which insects undergo in their short lives, and to\r\nwatch, hour after hour, the habits of the water-beetles and other\r\naquatic insects. After spoiling a considerable number of hats in chasing\r\nbutterflies, Lyell was supplied with a net and a cabinet in which to\r\nplace his stores of insect wealth. Oddly enough, some of the varieties of\r\nthe butterflies which young Lyell collected were of use in after years to\r\nCurtis the entomologist. The boy had no companions in these “un-English”\r\namusements, and was very grateful for the assistance of his father’s head\r\nservant, who knew a few plants by sight, and helped his young master.\r\n“Instead of sympathy,” wrote Lyell, “I received from almost every one\r\nbeyond my home, either ridicule, or hints that the pursuits of other boys\r\nwere more manly. Whether did I fancy that insects had no feeling? What\r\ncould be the use of them? The contemptuous appellation of ‘butterfly\r\nhunting’ applied to my favourite employment always nettled me.” However,\r\nLyell persisted, and when he got back to school he used to work at his\r\nfavourite subject out of school hours.\r\n\r\nFinding a number of expensive books in his father’s library on\r\nentomology, with beautiful plates in them, the boy’s common sense\r\ntold him that somebody prized all this knowledge, and that it must be\r\nvaluable. Oddly enough, he took to reading Linnæus for descriptions of\r\ninsects, and hunted up pictures of his captured butterflies in the plates\r\nof the more modern authors. Recovered in health, and fairly strong, Lyell\r\nwas sent at thirteen years of age to school at Dr. Bayley’s, preparatory\r\nto being sent to the great school at Winchester. The new school was at\r\nMidhurst, in Sussex, and it had all the demerits of the schools of the\r\nday, fighting, fagging, and bullying being rampant. Lyell came off well,\r\nalthough a weak and short-sighted boy. Nevertheless, he stated that the\r\nmethod of teaching got rid of “most of my natural antipathy to work and\r\nextreme absence of mind, and I acquired habits of attention, which were,\r\nhowever, painful to me, and only sustained when I had an object in view.”\r\n\r\nIt is evident that at this time, 1811-1813, Lyell’s heart was not\r\naltogether in his classics and mathematics, and that he was reading other\r\nsubjects which were more pleasing to him. At the early age of seventeen,\r\nLyell entered Exeter College, Oxford, and whilst working fairly well\r\nat his studies, cultivated music, and entered thoroughly into all the\r\npolitics and literary fellowships of the undergraduates. His love of\r\nnature persisted, and he began to direct his thoughts to the past, and to\r\nlearn something about fossils. Thus he found out the house of Sowerby,\r\nthe conchologist, by finding at the door an ammonite, well known to\r\nOxford geologists. Subsequently, when on a visit to Mr. Dawson Turner,\r\nof Norwich, he met a Javanese traveller, Dr. Arnold. Mr. Dawson Turner\r\nhad a fine collection of Norwich and Suffolk fossils. Lyell writes to his\r\nfather to say, “I have copied for Buckland, part of his paper, being a\r\nlist of those which are described, and shall copy the rest.” It appears\r\nthat the seed was sown by attending a course of lectures on geology,\r\nat Oxford, given by the celebrated Dr. Buckland, and it is no little\r\nthing for that great university to be able to assert that its teaching\r\ndeveloped the greatest system of geology ever brought forward. Lyell\r\ngeologized over Norfolk, and in his conversations with his host and Dr.\r\nArnold, it appeared that he had got hold of the idea, the elaboration of\r\nwhich is at the very bottom of his future great work. Lyell studied what\r\nis now in progress in nature so as to comprehend what occurred in the\r\npast times of the earth. Modern changes are the examples by which ancient\r\nchanges can alone be studied. He quotes in a letter to his father, the\r\nfollowing saying of Buckland and of White: “Local information, from\r\nactual observation, tends more to promote natural history science, than\r\nall that is done by the speculations and compilations of voluminous\r\nauthors.” Dr. Arnold made collections of Norfolk fossils, and catalogued\r\nthem, whilst his young friend endeavoured to make a geological map of the\r\ncounty. In the vacation Lyell and two friends went to Staffa, and his\r\ndescription of the grand columns of the old volcanic stone shows how he\r\nenjoyed and comprehended the scene.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 the family of the Lyells made a tour in France, Switzerland, and\r\nItaly, and the notes, letters, and diaries of the eldest son have been\r\npreserved, and they show how gradually, yet surely, he was educating\r\nhimself for that path which he, subsequently, never deserted. France\r\nwas not very lively, but he noticed the country more than the people,\r\nand observed the country changed with the soil. He spent his first\r\nSunday at Paris, and went to the Jardin des Plantes the first thing on\r\nMonday morning, but was disappointed by not hearing Cuvier lecture. In\r\nthe evening he went to see the great fountains at Versailles, where\r\nWellington was dining with some French marshals. Day after day the\r\nwonderful sights of Paris were visited; but Lyell, whenever he had the\r\nopportunity, slipped off to the Jardin des Plantes. He was much struck\r\nwith the collection of comparative anatomy, which he said might tempt\r\nanyone who had the opportunity of staying in Paris, to take up ardently\r\nthe study of anatomy. He studied Cuvier’s work on fossil remains, and\r\non the geology of the country round Paris. One of his visits was to\r\nCuvier’s lecture room, which he described as filled with fossil remains,\r\namong which are those glorious relics of a former world. Leaving Paris,\r\nLyell travelled by post, and noticed the geology and rocks of the\r\nmonotonous country to the Jura Mountains. He was mightily puzzled about\r\nthe rocks of the Jura, and enjoyed that magnificent scene of the Alps\r\nfrom the top of the hills over which he was travelling. He wrote, “In\r\ndescending the Jura from Lavatey to Gex, we had a most magnificent view\r\nof a vast extent of country. Below us the Lake of Geneva and the Canton\r\nde Vaud; before us the Savoy Alps towering up to the clouds, and in spite\r\nof their great distance and the height on which we stood, extended in a\r\nlong line before us like an army of giants, Mont Blanc rising high above\r\nall in the middle as their chief. We saw the Dent du Midi to our left,\r\nshooting up his two remarkable peaks, with many more of extraordinary\r\nand picturesque forms.” On visiting the Valley of Chamouni, we find\r\nLyell naming the rocks of the different well known scenes, according\r\nto the accepted terms of the mineralogists of the day, and this is a\r\nsatisfactory proof that he had been studying geology very effectually,\r\nby himself, before he left England. He saw his first glacier, of any\r\nimportance, and was immensely struck with the changes it was producing in\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nMany books have been written about Mont Blanc, its botany and its\r\nglaciers, but none have ever equalled, in truthfulness and freshness\r\nof description, the diary of Lyell. He seized upon all the remarkable\r\npoints to be noticed, and shone both as a botanist and geologist. He,\r\nmoreover, did not forget his old entomological tastes, for he chased\r\nbutterflies in the valley of the Arve, and was delighted with the Alpine\r\nrhododendrons, and the little _ranunculus glacialis_. On the Grimsel\r\nLyell saw “some extraordinary large bare pieces of granite-rock, which\r\nI could not account for,” and was puzzled by the redness of the snow in\r\nsome places. Afterwards on the Wengern Alp, he saw a fine avalanche fall\r\nover a precipice on to a ledge below. He went to the Valais to see the\r\nresult of the great flood the previous June, and witnessed the results of\r\nthe enormous force of running water, carrying with it sand and stone, on\r\neverything against which it came in contact.\r\n\r\nLyell then crossed the Alps and visited the Italian lakes and the\r\nprincipal towns of Italy, but more as an antiquarian than a geologist.\r\n\r\nThe long journey bore fruit, for the constant proofs of changes ever\r\nprogressing in nature, which were brought before Lyell’s notice,\r\ninfluenced his mind in a very decided manner. He became opposed to the\r\nconvulsionist doctrines of sudden and violent changes having occurred,\r\nand furthered the ideas taught by Hutton, that the alterations on the\r\nsurface of the earth are slow and constant, and have been uniform for\r\nages. In 1819 Lyell took his B.A. degree at Oxford, obtaining a second\r\nclass in classical honours, and in the same year he became a fellow of\r\nthe Geological Society of London, and of the Linnæan Society. On leaving\r\nOxford he was entered at Lincoln’s Inn, and resided in London, and\r\nstudied law in a special pleader’s office. His eyes became weak, and he\r\nwas advised to give up reading for a time, and to join his father in a\r\nvisit to Rome in 1820. In 1822 Lyell was in full correspondence with the\r\nmost prominent geologists of the day, and he was doing original work, for\r\nhis letters show that he was interesting himself about the fresh water\r\nstrata of the Isle of Wight, and about the bones found in Kirkdale cave,\r\nof hyæna, elephant, rhinoceros, etc. His enthusiasm and ability to work\r\nwere recognized in the very remarkable selection the Geological Society\r\nmade in 1823. For he was then elected one of the secretaries, and his\r\nfriends were Mantell and Buckland. The same year he went to Paris to see\r\nthe French geologists and Cuvier. Cuvier was very polite, and introduced\r\nLyell to Madlle. Duvancel, his step-daughter, and Lyell spoke very well\r\nof her ability and engaging manners. He met Humboldt and Laplace and\r\nArago, the mathematicians and astronomers of the day.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Lyell was interesting himself about Dean Coneabeare’s discovery\r\nof a plesiosaurus at Lyme Regis, and the fossil was brought in triumph\r\nto the rooms of the Geological Society, then established at 20, Bedford\r\nStreet. Then he started on a geological excursion in the west of England\r\nwith M. Prévost, and subsequently went to his birthplace and geologized\r\nin Scotland.\r\n\r\nLyell was called to the bar in 1825, and went the western circuit for two\r\nyears, and in 1826 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1827\r\nhe wrote an article in the _Quarterly Review_, showing how thoroughly he\r\nidentified himself with the school of geology that taught the necessity\r\nof studying the past from the modern example of slow and gradual changes\r\non the earth by forces which have always been in existence. In 1828\r\nappeared his papers on the excavation of valleys by ordinary agencies,\r\nsuch as the sun’s heat, frost, rain, running water and the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable book on the Geology of Central France, with especial\r\nreference to the extinct volcanoes and lava flows of the Auvergne, was\r\nwritten by Mr. Scrope, and its criticism was the foundation of the\r\narticle in the _Quarterly Review_ just noticed. Lyell was so impressed\r\nwith the grand descriptions in the book, that he determined to persuade\r\nMr. and Mrs. Murchison to accompany him on a tour into the region. Two of\r\nLyell’s letters to his father are so characteristic that they may well\r\nfind a place here.\r\n\r\n                                                   Clermont-Ferrand.\r\n                                                   _May 26th, 1828._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n    I have just returned again to Clermont, from an expedition\r\n    of five days, and we have discovered that there is no end\r\n    to the work to be done in this country, and that it is of\r\n    the most interesting description. The first day was spent in\r\n    ascending some of the lofty volcanic Puys near here. Mrs.\r\n    Murchison accompanied us, and then returned to Clermont, where\r\n    she employed herself, during our absence, in making panoramic\r\n    sketches, receiving several of the gentry and professors, to\r\n    whom he had letters, in the neighbourhood, and collecting\r\n    plants and shells, etc., while Murchison and I, with my man,\r\n    went on in a patache, a one-horse machine on springs. We first\r\n    visited Pontgibaud and the Sioule, to see the excavations made\r\n    by that river in the grand lava-current of the Come, which\r\n    descended from the central range, and dispossessed the river\r\n    of its bed. The scenery was beautiful. Just as we were leaving\r\n    the place, the peasants offered to take us to a volcano farther\r\n    down the river. As no Puy was mentioned in Desmarest’s accurate\r\n    map, nor by Scrope, we thought their account a mere fable; but\r\n    their description of the cinders, etc. was so curious, that we\r\n    had the courage to relinquish our day’s scheme, and proceed\r\n    again down the river.\r\n\r\n    You may imagine our surprise when we found, within a ride of\r\n    Clermont, a set of volcanic phenomena entirely unknown to\r\n    Buckland, Scrope, or the natives here. A volcanic cone, with a\r\n    stream of basaltic lava issuing out on both sides, and flowing\r\n    down to the gorge of the Sioule. This defile was flanked on\r\n    both sides by precipitous cliffs of gneiss, and the river’s\r\n    passage must have been entirely choked up for a long time. A\r\n    lake was formed, and the river wore a passage between the lava\r\n    and the granitic schist, but the former was so excessively\r\n    compact, that the schist evidently suffered most. In the\r\n    progress of ages, the igneous rock, one hundred and fifty\r\n    feet deep, was cut through, and the river went on and ate its\r\n    way, thirty-five, forty-five, and in one place eighty-five\r\n    feet into the subjacent granitic beds, leaving on one bank a\r\n    perpendicular wall of basaltic lava towering over the gneiss.\r\n    In the Vivarrais, where similar phenomena had been observed,\r\n    Herschel had remarked a bed of pebbles between the lava and the\r\n    gneiss, marking the ancient river-bed, but Buckland endeavoured\r\n    to get over this difficulty by saying that these pebbles might\r\n    have covered a sloping bank when the river filled the valley,\r\n    and that this bank may have always been high above the river\r\n    bed; for if the sloping sides of a valley, said the Professor,\r\n    be covered with pebbles, as they often are, and the valley is\r\n    filled with lava, and then the lava cut through and partially\r\n    removed, there will of course be a line of pebbles at the\r\n    junction of the lava and the rock beneath, but these pebbles\r\n    will not mark an ancient river bed. Now, unluckily for the\r\n    doctor in this case, he has no loophole; an old lead mine, said\r\n    to have been worked by the Romans, happens to have exactly laid\r\n    open the line of contact, and the pebble bed of the old river\r\n    is seen going in under the lava, horizontally, for nearly fifty\r\n    feet. This is an astonishing proof of what a river can do\r\n    in some thousands or hundred thousand years by its continual\r\n    wearing. No deluge could have descended the valley without\r\n    carrying away the crater and ashes above.\r\n\r\n    Six hundred or seven hundred feet higher, is an old plateau of\r\n    basalt, and if this flowed at the bottom of the then valley,\r\n    the last work of the Sioule is but a unit in proportion to the\r\n    other. There are several of the Clermont savans who, since they\r\n    discovered how much we were interested with this, have given\r\n    us to understand they intended to publish on it, but no doubt\r\n    they will take a year before they launch out in the expense of\r\n    a patache to Pontgibaud. Murchison certainly keeps it up with\r\n    more energy than anyone I ever travelled with, for Buckland,\r\n    though he worked as hard, always flew about too fast to make\r\n    sure of anything. Mons. Le Coq, the botanist, a clever young\r\n    man, assures me that the geology of the soils does not affect\r\n    the botany of Auvergne. I shall get some specimens from him\r\n    for Dr. Hooker, I expect. None to be bought, at least this\r\n    year, for it seems there may be hereafter. It is a wonderful\r\n    fact that _Glaux maritima_ grows round some saline springs\r\n    here. Busset, an engineer, who is mapping Auvergne, has forced\r\n    us to dine with him to-morrow. As we know his object to be to\r\n    get geology out of us, of which he knows nothing, M. fears it\r\n    will be a bore, but the man is evidently clever. We shall get\r\n    barometric heights from him, and a map of our little volcanic\r\n    district, and if he pumps unreasonably, I shall find a\r\n    difficulty in expressing myself in French. We are to meet Count\r\n    Le Serres there, a gentlemanlike and well-informed naturalist,\r\n    who has a property on Mont Dore, and knows more geology than\r\n    anyone we have met here, professors not excepted. He organized\r\n    a geological society here, and they chose Count Montlosier\r\n    as president; but the Jesuits took alarm, and, declaring\r\n    that Montlosier had written a book against Genesis, got the\r\n    Prefect and Mayor and Government to oppose, and at last put\r\n    the thing down; at least it merged in the regular scientific\r\n    Etablissement de la Ville, and Montlosier is just coming out\r\n    with a book against the Jesuits, a more popular subject in\r\n    France at present than geology. We are to visit him at his\r\n    château near Mont Dore. We like the people and the country.\r\n\r\n                   Believe me, your affectionate son,\r\n\r\n                                                      CHARLES LYELL.\r\n\r\n                             TO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\n                                       Bains de Mont Dore, Auvergne.\r\n                                       _June 6th, 1882._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n    I am at this moment arrived here, after passing three\r\n    delightful days at Count de Montlosier’s, an old man of\r\n    seventy-four, in full possession of faculties of no mean order,\r\n    and of an imagination as lively as a poet’s of twenty-five. I\r\n    stayed a day longer than the Murchisons, as I was determined to\r\n    have one more trial to find a junction between the granite of\r\n    the Puy chain and the fresh water formations of the Limagne,\r\n    and I actually found it; and my day’s work alone will throw a\r\n    new light on the history of this remarkable country. I believe\r\n    most of the granite to have made its appearance at the surface\r\n    at a later period than even the fresh water tertiary beds have,\r\n    though they contain the remains of quadrupeds. The scenery\r\n    of Mont Dore is that of an Alpine valley, deep, with tall\r\n    fir woods, high aiguilles above, half covered with snow, and\r\n    cataracts and waterfalls. A watering-place with good views at\r\n    the bottom of the valley. I shall send Hall back from here, as,\r\n    although he has been useful, I do not think the advantage will\r\n    overbalance the additional expense. Le Coq has promised some\r\n    plants for certain, and Hall has done pretty well in insects.\r\n\r\n                   Believe me, your affectionate son,\r\n\r\n                                                      CHARLES LYELL.\r\n\r\nLyell was not sparing of criticism so far as his friend Murchison’s\r\nhabits were concerned, as may be gleaned in the following letter:—\r\n\r\n                             TO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\n                                       Bains de Mont Dore, Auvergne.\r\n                                       _June 11th, 1828._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MOTHER,\r\n\r\n    We have been so actively employed, I may really say so\r\n    laboriously, that I assure you I can with great difficulty\r\n    find a moment to write a letter. This morning we got off,\r\n    after breakfast at five o’clock, on horseback, to return from\r\n    St. Amand to this: arrived at seven o’clock. But one day we\r\n    rode fifty-five miles, which I shall take care shall be the\r\n    last experiment of that kind, as even the old Leicestershire\r\n    fox-hunter was nearly done up with it. But I have really gained\r\n    strength so much, that I believe I and my eyes were never in\r\n    such condition before; and I am sure that six hours in bed,\r\n    which is all we allow, and exercise all day long for the body,\r\n    and geology for the mind, with plenty of the vin du pays, which\r\n    is good here, is the best thing that can be invented in this\r\n    world for my health and happiness. Murchison must have been\r\n    intended for a very strong man, if the sellers of drugs had not\r\n    enlisted him into their service, so that he depends on them\r\n    for his existence to a frightful extent, yet withal he can\r\n    get through what would knock up most men who never need the\r\n    doctor. He has only given in one day and a half yet. On one\r\n    occasion we were on an expedition together, and as a stronger\r\n    dose was necessary than he had with him, I was not a little\r\n    alarmed at finding there was no pharmacy in the place, but at\r\n    last we went to a nunnery, where Mdlle. la Supérieuse sold all\r\n    medicines without profit—positively a young, clever, and rather\r\n    good-looking lady, who hoped my friend would think better of\r\n    it, as the quantity would kill six Frenchmen. M. was cured, and\r\n    off the next morning, as usual. The mischief is, that he has\r\n    naturally a weak though a sound stomach, and if he possessed a\r\n    more than ordinary share of self-denial, and was very prudent,\r\n    and after much exercise did not eat a good dinner when set\r\n    before him—if, in short, he would take the advice which many\r\n    find it easy to give him, he would be well. He has much talent\r\n    for original observation in geology, and is indefatigable, so\r\n    that we make much way, and are thrown so much in the way of the\r\n    people, high and low, by means of our letters of introduction,\r\n    and our pursuits, that I am getting large materials, which I\r\n    hope I shall find means of applying. Indeed, I really think I\r\n    am most profitably employed on this tour, and as long as things\r\n    go on as well as they do now, I should be very sorry to leave\r\n    off; particularly as, from our plan of operation, which is\r\n    that of comparison of the structure of different parts of the\r\n    country, we work on with a continually increasing power, and in\r\n    the last week have with the same exertion done at least twice\r\n    as much in the way of discovery, and in enlarging our knowledge\r\n    of what others had done, as in any preceding. I expect it will\r\n    be at least three weeks before we can have done with Central\r\n    France, and then we hope to work south towards Nice, down the\r\n    Rhone, keeping always in analogous formations, and then to the\r\n    Vicentin, if possible, though this is very uncertain, as we can\r\n    never see far before us, either as to time or place, directing\r\n    our course according to the new lights we are gaining.\r\n\r\n    We shall leave this place in a day or two. I like it well\r\n    enough, but it is certainly too early in the season to enjoy\r\n    it; and Mrs. Murchison suffers from the cold and damp, though\r\n    she has not often complained in this tone.\r\n\r\n    Mont Dore is partially covered with snow, and almost always\r\n    with clouds, and the transition in coming up here from the\r\n    low country is violent. Yesterday we rode up from the climate\r\n    of Italy to that of Scotland. It is the most varied and\r\n    picturesque country imaginable. There are innumerable old\r\n    ruins for sketches, with lakes, cascades, and different kinds\r\n    of wood, so that we wonder more and more that the English\r\n    have not found it out. The peasantry are very obliging,\r\n    industrious, well-fed, and clothed, and to all appearance are\r\n    the very happiest I ever saw. We have crossed the chain of\r\n    Puys, the Limagne, and the valleys leading from Mont Dore,\r\n    in all directions. The people in the higher regions begin to\r\n    talk French—at least there are generally some who have served\r\n    in the armies, and their children catch some from them. Their\r\n    own language has a good deal of the old Provençal in it, and a\r\n    great many of the terminations are Italian. In short, we often\r\n    find a demand in Italian succeed when French misses fire; but\r\n    all our ammunition often fails to produce any impression. The\r\n    population is dense, and bears no other resemblance to other\r\n    parts of France that ever I saw. In the mountains a large\r\n    portion do not believe that Napoleon is dead, especially the\r\n    old soldiers. There is an almost entire want of gentry here,\r\n    but as it does not arise from absenteeism, but from the great\r\n    sub-division of property, it evidently produces no ill effects\r\n    on the character and well-being of the people.\r\n\r\n    Give my love to all at Kinnordy, and believe me\r\n\r\n                         Your affectionate son,\r\n\r\n                                                      CHARLES LYELL.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting the south of France with Murchison, Lyell prepared to\r\ncross the Alps and to see Vesuvius, he being impressed with the necessity\r\nof studying that grand modern example in order to understand, perfectly,\r\nthe extinct volcanoes they had been studying in the Auvergne. He wrote\r\nhis father—“I scarcely despair now, so much do these evidences of modern\r\naction increase upon us as we go south (towards the more recent volcanic\r\nseat of action) of proving the positive identity of the causes now\r\noperating with those of former times.” This was always his point, and it\r\ncertainly was not Murchison’s.\r\n\r\nWhen at Vesuvius, Lyell recognized the similarity of some very old\r\nvolcanic dykes of Scotland with those recently exposed in the old crater.\r\nEtna was visited, and he was delighted at finding sea-shells, resembling\r\nthose now living on the floor of the Mediterranean close by, some three\r\nhundred feet above sea level. Whilst at Naples, and in the midst of the\r\nhighly suggestive scenery of the beautiful neighbourhood, Lyell wrote to\r\nMurchison a very characteristic letter, which should be well pondered\r\nover even by wealthy men who enter into the studies of nature, and which\r\nmight be read with benefit by those people who on this not over civilized\r\nearth, hold the purse-strings of the world and treat scientific teachers\r\nwith gross meanness. With all his advantages Lyell could not undertake\r\nthe research which made him famous, which has tended to elevate our\r\nconception of the laws of nature, and which has done so much to lead\r\ngeologists along the right path, without caring much for pecuniary\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHe wrote, “I will tell you fairly that it is at present of no small\r\nconsequence to me to get a respectable sum for my volume, not only to\r\ncover expenses for present and future projected campaigns, but because\r\nmy making my hobby pay the additional costs which it entails, will\r\nalone justify my pursuing it with a mind sufficiently satisfied with\r\nitself, and so to feel independent and free to indulge in the enthusiasm\r\nnecessary for success. I shall never hope to make money by geology,\r\nbut not to lose, and _tax others_ for my amusement; and unless I can\r\nsecure this, it would, in my circumstances, be selfish in me to devote\r\nmyself as much as I hope to do to it.” These sentiments did Lyell great\r\nhonour. “My work is in part written, and all planned. It will not pretend\r\nto give even an abstract of all that is known in geology, but it will\r\nendeavour to establish the principle of reasoning on the science. All my\r\ngeology will come in as illustrative of my views of those principles,\r\nand as evidence strengthening the system necessarily arising out of\r\nthe admission of such principles, which as you know, are neither more\r\nnor less than, that _no causes whatever_ have, from the earliest time\r\nto which we can look back to the present, ever acted, but those _now\r\nacting_; and that they never acted with different degrees of energy from\r\nthat which they now exert. If I can but earn the wherewith to carry on\r\nthe war, or rather, its _extraordinary costs_, depend upon it I will\r\nwaste no time in book-making for lucre’s sake.”\r\n\r\nLyell’s long-expected book on the “Principles of Geology” was published\r\nin 1830, and it made a very considerable sensation, and was warmly\r\ncombated and abused. Now it is admitted as the most conclusive and\r\nuseful of introductory books, fit for a youth, and eminently good in\r\nits tone. Then the man, ever on the move, left for the Pyrenees, and\r\nstudied the formations there, and especially devoted himself to the\r\nexplanation of ripple-marks in the hundreds of feet of rock, and noticed\r\nthe effects of water-borne and air-carried sand in accumulating flats\r\nof ripples one over the other. In 1831 Lyell accepted the position of\r\nProfessor of Geology in King’s College, London, and he gave courses of\r\nlectures there in 1832 and 1833; and he became engaged to Mary, the\r\neldest daughter of Mr. Leonard Horner, a geologist of considerable\r\nreputation, and a thoroughly liberal-minded man. Mr. Horner was a great\r\nfriend of Lyell’s before the engagement, and was a most painstaking man\r\nand a great manager at the Geological Society. Lyell’s letters to Miss\r\nHorner are most interesting, and show how admirable a woman she was\r\nand how she stimulated him to follow out his great destiny. His work\r\non the “Principles” became a great pecuniary success, and he laboured\r\nhard at King’s College, and was much annoyed at the decision of the\r\ncouncil at the College, not to allow women to attend his lectures, which\r\nwere a great success. Married, Lyell started for Germany, the Rhine,\r\nand Switzerland. Coming home to London, he set to work at his lectures\r\nat the Royal Institution, where ladies were admitted, and at King’s\r\nCollege, where they were not. He had two hundred and fifty people to\r\nhear his introductory lecture at King’s College, and it dwindled down\r\nto fifteen in a few days, not from any want of care or excellence in\r\nLyell, who was ever bitter against the establishment for their refusal\r\nto advance female education. He retired from the professorship as soon\r\nas he found that it interfered with his researches, and never again took\r\nany part in academical teaching. The trouble he took about his lectures\r\nwas great, and he went to great expense in having diagrams well drawn.\r\nHis retirement was a great loss to the College, which now admits ladies\r\nto certain lectures. In 1834, Lyell travelled in Sweden and examined\r\ninto the rise of the land in Scandinavia, and whilst enjoying his hard\r\ngeological work—for he was well received by everybody, and taken to see\r\neverything—his letters show how he missed his gentle and sympathizing\r\nwife. On his return home Lyell received one of the Royal Society medals\r\nfor his work on the “Principles of Geology,” and in 1838 became President\r\nof the Geological Society. About this time his attention was strongly\r\ndrawn to the relative numbers of living species found in the strata which\r\nhad been formed during the last geological or tertiary age. In working\r\nat Sicily he had found that in the latest beds in which the shells were\r\nhardly fossilised, all the species were still living. That is to say,\r\nhe collected shells which were of course dead, but they were similar to\r\nothers which were alive on the floor of the sea close by. The individual\r\nhad died, but the kind or species was still alive. He examined the latest\r\nstrata in England, the crag of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex, and found\r\nthat the proportion of recent shells—that is to say, of dead individuals\r\nbelonging to living species—is great. Some of the shells belonged to\r\nkinds which are not now living, and are extinct. He wrote, “I think we\r\nmay lay it down as a rule, that if any given tertiary deposit in which\r\nwe have found a few species of shells only, of which one half, or a\r\nthird, or even less, are recent, and those recent ones inhabit the seas\r\nimmediately adjoining, the formation will be pliocene.” This word was one\r\nof three invented by Dr. Whewell, of Cambridge, at Lyell’s suggestion\r\nto explain the gradual development of the recent animals and plants\r\nduring the past history of the globe. The other terms were “miocene”\r\nand “eocene.” The most ancient deposit which was supposed by Lyell to\r\ncontain evidences of existing genera was at the dawn of the last great\r\ngeological period, the tertiary. It was called eocene from ηως, dawn,\r\nκαὶνος, recent. The next deposits overlying these older ones contained,\r\naccording to his estimate, seventeen per cent. of living species, all\r\nthe rest being extinct; and they were called miocene, from μεῖον, less,\r\nand καὶνος, recent; expressing a minor proportion of recent species to\r\nthat found in the topmost and most recent tertiary deposits. These last\r\ncontain a large proportion of recent species, and are called pliocene,\r\nπλεὶον, more, and καὶνος, recent. It was a grand theory, which has\r\nremained almost unaltered, and it influenced the progress of geology,\r\nfor it plainly inferred that the living things of the present have been\r\nlinked with those of the past time by direct descent; that many forms of\r\nlife have become extinct, and that there is some wonderful law relating\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nAbout this time many were the geological heresies, and the lovers of the\r\nnotion of the violent actions of nature evolved theories about volcanoes\r\nand the occurrence of vast waves to account for the presence of the great\r\nmasses of rock which are found strewn far and wide and away from their\r\nsources. These Lyell successfully antagonized. He then published the\r\n“Elements of Geology,” and his time was fully occupied in the meetings\r\nof the Geological Society, in criticising work, and in genial scientific\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1841 Lyell crossed the Atlantic, and spent thirteen\r\nmonths in the United States, Canada, and Nova Scotia. He worked hard as\r\nan observer and recorder, and his comparisons between the strata in the\r\nNew and Old World are full of interest. Writing from Philadelphia to his\r\nfather-in-law, Mr. Horner, he says, “Here I am working away in quarries\r\nof greensand and picking up belemnites and other cretaceous fossils;”\r\nand then to Dr. Mantell, “After staying two days we went by New York\r\nand the Hudson to Albany, where I began my explorings in the silurian\r\nstrata, and from whence I examined the valley of the Mohawk. The Falls\r\nof Niagara were as beautiful as I expected, perhaps scarcely so grand,\r\nbut in geological interest far beyond my most sanguine hopes. So I shall\r\nsend a paper on the proofs of their recession to the Geological Society.\r\nI will not dwell on them now. After spending some time there, I examined\r\nseriatim, all the silurian groups and the old red and coal on the borders\r\nof Pennsylvania. Returning to Albany, I went south to Philadelphia,\r\nand spent four days in collecting in the different divisions of the\r\ngreensand, and in New Jersey. The analogy of the genera, and even of the\r\nspecies of the European chalk, is most striking.”\r\n\r\nOne of his duties in the United States, was to give a course of lectures\r\nat the Lowell Institute, at which his audiences amounted to two thousand.\r\nHe also went north, and made some most important investigations with\r\nDr. Dawson, then a comparatively unknown school missionary struggling\r\nto learn something about nature, and now one of the most distinguished\r\ngeologists in the world. They dug out roots called by fossilists\r\nstigmariæ, which once supported huge trees called sigillariæ in the days\r\nof the coal formation, and they measured foot by foot many hundreds of\r\nyards of the cliffs of the now celebrated place called Toggins, in Nova\r\nScotia. There they found rows of trees, one over the other, erect, and\r\nindicating that, when the part of the earth now cut into by the sea and\r\nexposed as a cliff was formed, there was a series of ages, each having\r\nits forest, each of which was overwhelmed, and thus forest after forest\r\naccumulated. Amongst the trees were some hollow ones, and they contained\r\nlittle fossils, such as shells and scales. They were objects of interest,\r\nbut it was not until later on that Lyell and Dawson saw their importance.\r\nThis subterranean forest exceeds in extent and quantity of timber all\r\nthat have been found in Europe put together. The new deposit of red sand\r\nof the numerous estuaries there afforded them endless instruction. “At\r\nthis place, Truro, the tide is said to rise seventy-five feet, and we see\r\nthe bottom of a deep salt-water sea, its rippled sands, shells and holes\r\nof _Mya_ and _Tellina_ and their tracks, footmarks of birds and worms,\r\nthe manner in which the clays crack and are marked with the rain, and\r\nsometimes shells included recently in solid models of claystone. I have\r\nalso learned more about the geological effects of drifting ice in the\r\nlast ten days than in all the Canadian tour.”\r\n\r\nLyell returned to England, and, after a short rest, started for the\r\nnorth of Ireland. He wrote to his sister: “We have just returned from a\r\nwalk over the grand pavement (Giant’s Causeway), the effect of which was\r\nas picturesque as the evening sun and some white breakers rolling and\r\nfoaming over the black rocks could make it. Much as I have been pleased\r\nwith the sight, it strikes me that there are parts of Staffa away from\r\nFingal’s Cave, and which travellers have seldom leisure to visit, which\r\nare even finer in precisely the same style. The geology of Antrim is very\r\ninteresting—so many formations, such as chalk, green sand, lias, new\r\nred—and the coal being represented by such distinctly characterized and\r\nyet such thin sets of strata, compared to the same groups elsewhere; and\r\nthen the grand trap or basaltic mass covering and cutting through them\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nOften slightly political in his ideas, Lyell wrote much about the Irish\r\npeasantry, and spoke of them as the quick, obliging, and fine-looking\r\nnatives of the Green Island. He remarked, in 1843, “One cannot help\r\nfearing that the anti-English spirit has sunk deep into the hearts of\r\nthe millions here, for they read nothing but O’Connell’s newspapers,\r\nfrom which he artfully excludes, without appearing to them to do so,\r\nevery other foreign or domestic topic of interest except repeal and Irish\r\ngrievances—a great proportion of them now bygone.”\r\n\r\nHe kept steadily at work preparing his American travels for publication,\r\nand in a note to a friend regarding the nature of coal, he instanced the\r\nswamps of Virginia. “The Virginian morasses allow, under a hot sun, great\r\naccumulations of black vegetable matter, nearly like peat, and which\r\nmight make coal. The shade of _Cupressus distichi_, Thuya, and water oaks\r\nshut out the sun, and ferns and mosses draw in the damp air beneath,\r\nwhile the heat causes evaporation, and evaporation cold. One swamp which\r\nI saw is forty miles long by twenty broad. Thousands of prostrate trees\r\nare in the peat.” Some investigators held that the atmosphere must have\r\ncontained a large amount of carbonic acid gas during the ages in which\r\ncoal was being formed out of decaying vegetation, but Lyell, adhering\r\nto his strictly uniformitarian views, denied this, and considered the\r\nVirginian swamps to be explanatory of the formation of coal.\r\n\r\nLyell went to see the skeleton, brought by a German named Koch from\r\nthe Missouri, of a very large mastodon, and was wonderfully amused to\r\nnotice how this savant had made it up out of fragments. “He has turned\r\nthe huge tusks the wrong way—horizontally, has made the first pair of\r\nribs into collar-bones, and has intercalated several spurious dorsal\r\nand tail vertebræ, and has placed the toe-bones wrong to prove, what\r\nhe really believes, that it was web-footed. I think he is a mixture of\r\nan enthusiast and an impostor, but more of the former, and amusingly\r\nignorant. His mode of advertising is a thousand dollars reward for\r\nanyone who will prove that the bones of his Missourium are made of wood.\r\nHe is soon to take them to London, when you will have a treat, and see a\r\nlarger femur (thigh-bone) than that of Iguanodon.” He was delighted with\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nLyell revisited America in 1845, and on returning across the Atlantic\r\nin 1846, narrowly escaped shipwreck on an iceberg; but he made an\r\ninteresting observation about one great berg. “It had a large rock,\r\ntwelve feet square, on the top, and much gravel and sand on its side.\r\nThe bergs were from fifty to four hundred feet in height, pyramidal,\r\npinnacled, dome-shaped, single-peaked, double-peaked, flat-topped, and of\r\nevery form and most picturesque, and only a quarter of a mile off us.”\r\n\r\nThe lesson was not lost, for Lyell had thus ocular proof concerning\r\nhow stones of huge size and gravity, can travel far from their proper\r\nlocation. And as these icebergs capsize or melt he was confirmed in\r\nhis views that many deposits of huge stones and gravels in the form of\r\n“drift” have been produced in this manner.\r\n\r\nHaving now attained great eminence, Lyell began to write and agitate\r\nabout the scientific teaching of the Universities, and his opinion of\r\nthe decidedly unprogressive character of them was proved to be correct\r\nwhen only four heads of houses out of twenty-four were at Oxford to\r\nreceive the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He urged\r\nstrongly the necessity of placing the lay teacher on the same pecuniary\r\nlevel as the clergy. Moreover, he made a vigorous attempt to have truly\r\nscientific presidents of the Royal Society, and not only noblemen of high\r\nand royal standing. The Queen honoured Lyell with her regard, and Prince\r\nAlbert used to get him to talk about America and the Americans, listening\r\nalways with great interest. He was knighted for his distinguished\r\nservices to science, and the conferring of this dignity pleased the whole\r\nscientific world.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Sir Charles Lyell was re-elected president of the Geological\r\nSociety, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Sumner, attended at\r\nthe annual dinner given on the occasion. After the expiration of his\r\npresidency, Lyell again went to the United States, and, returning,\r\nvisited Teneriffe, the Grand Canary, and Palma, arriving in England in\r\n1854.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 and the two following years Sir Charles and Lady Lyell travelled\r\nmuch on the continent, and always with a view of studying existing nature\r\nso as to comprehend the past. He was gratified by finding that most of\r\nthe rising teachers in Germany were using his books as text books for\r\ntheir lectures, and that the doctrines of Hutton he had elaborated were\r\nso much appreciated. In Switzerland, Lyell interested himself more than\r\never about the great remains of former ice action on the rocks. He was\r\nat one time disposed to believe that certain masses of mud containing\r\nangular stones, derived from a distance, could have been produced by the\r\nsea, but not finding any remains of marine animals, or evidence of such\r\naction as the ice would produce in rounding and waterwearing stone, he\r\nbegan to examine the influence of glaciers in wearing rocks and carrying\r\nthe rubbish down with them. He was of course aware that there had been an\r\nage of cold in Switzerland, corresponding to the glacial epoch of Europe\r\nto the north, and he was therefore prepared to find some proofs of the\r\nformer great extension of glaciers beyond their present limits. He was\r\ndisposed to believe that the Alps were higher than they now are in that\r\nage of cold. In order to account for the former action of ice and the\r\nproduction of huge moraines, in comparison with which those now found\r\nat the glacier foot are pigmies, Lyell wrote: “In the glacial period,\r\nwhen the weight of ice was enormously greater, when in the region of the\r\nAlps there was so little melting, when glaciers at present only ten,\r\nfifteen, and twenty miles long, and from three hundred to one thousand\r\nfeet deep, were fifty to one hundred, and even one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles long, and four thousand feet deep (and if there is any truth at\r\nall in the generally received theory of the old Swiss glaciers, such\r\nmust have been their gigantic dimensions), one may readily grant that\r\nthe pressure and friction were so much in excess of what we now see as\r\nto explain the contrast between the ice work done in the olden times,\r\nand that accomplished in our own days, to say nothing of the probably\r\ndisproportionate length of the periods compared.” He noticed an old\r\nterminal moraine, in advance of the new one of the Rhone glacier, covered\r\nwith wild plants, some in full flower, and cut through in two places by\r\nthe river; its height was only fifteen feet, and its width ninety feet.\r\nHe went underneath the Viesch glacier in the Upper Vallais, and beyond\r\nit; in consequence of its having melted much, he saw a rounded and domed\r\nsurface of granite, smooth, and with straight furrows a quarter of an\r\ninch deep exactly in the direction of the onward movement of the glacier.\r\nOn the Ruffelhorn, on the right lateral moraine, that is on the surface\r\nof the ice close to the rocks, he saw a splendid mass of granite, angular\r\nin shape, and measuring fifty-nine feet long, forty-nine feet wide, and\r\nforty-two feet high. Its sides were polished and furrowed. This huge mass\r\nwas being carried slowly down, by the glacier, and will be deposited at\r\nits foot some day or other. Once it formed a part of the valley side, and\r\nit fell on to the glacier, whose flanks had scrubbed it for many a long\r\nday. He particularly noticed how the glaciers had been advancing of late\r\nyears (just as they are now receding).\r\n\r\nLyell followed out these researches on the south of the Alps, and he\r\nfirst of all made many excursions, accompanied by Gastaldi, one of the\r\nbest of the scientific men of Turin, and by Michelotti, in order to\r\ncompare the shells which are found fossil in the middle tertiary strata\r\non the south of the Alps, with those of the molasse of Switzerland to\r\nthe north. He found that these strata, separated by the great mass of\r\nthe mountains, resembled each other somewhat mineralogically as well as\r\nin their fossils, but he was not able to make out that they were exactly\r\nof the same geological age, although it was highly probable. He wrote on\r\nthe glaciers ancient and modern of the southern slopes of the Alps, and\r\nin relation to the former—“A comparison also of the extinct glaciers of\r\nthe Italian and Swiss sides of the Alps can better be made from Turin\r\nthan from any other place. Before my arrival I had seen, on the banks of\r\nthe Lago Maggiore, some good examples of erratics and of moraines which\r\nhad come from the Simplon, but these, as you might suppose, _a priori_\r\nare far inferior to those which have descended from the Val d’Aosta, or\r\nwhich belong to the mighty glacier derived from the combined snows of\r\nthe Mont Blanc and the Mont Rosa group of Alpine heights. This glacier,\r\nalthough perhaps of less gigantic dimensions than that of the Rhone, has\r\ncertainly left, as Gastaldi first pointed out in a memoir on the subject,\r\na far more imposing monument of itself on the plains of the Po, than have\r\nthe extinct glaciers of the Rhone or the Rhine, in the lower country of\r\nSwitzerland.” He noticed that “J. D. Forbes has well shown in his book\r\non the Alps, that a glacier is a peculiarly sensitive instrument for\r\nmeasuring the average of heat and cold, and that every slight difference\r\nof temperature causes it to increase or lessen in height and length.”\r\nAnd pursuing the argument, remarks that as geologists had shown from\r\nthe nature of the fossil remains in lately formed gravels, that arctic\r\nanimals lived far south in Europe, shortly before the existing state of\r\nthings, we ought to find evidences of the cold climate which allowed\r\nthose animals to live so far south. These evidences are at hand in the\r\nremains of the glaciers, which in those days extended far lower than they\r\ndo now, and were grander in extent. Thus a lofty mound or ridge, two\r\nthousand feet high, called the Serra, running into the great alluvial\r\nflat of the River Po, where maize and mulberries grow, is a huge terminal\r\nmoraine of an ancient glacier. Ice reigned supreme there in the glacial\r\nperiod, and brought down the stone from the distant hills, and deposited\r\nit on the Serra. In Forfarshire, Lyell had noticed the peculiar contorted\r\nappearance of the beds of clay, gravel and sand of glacial formation,\r\nand also in the mud cliffs of Norfolk. He was anxious to know whether\r\nany of the ancient glacial heaps or moraines of the country south of the\r\nAlps, showed similar indications of pressure and forcing along by ice.\r\n“It happened that a railway was making from Turin to Ivrea, and although\r\nthey cut through the lowest part of the terminal moraines near Mazzi they\r\nhave thought it worth while to make a tunnel, through which we walked.”\r\nNear the entrance, “I was delighted,” wrote Lyell, “to see that curious\r\nfolding of the strata, which will cause the same beds to be here pierced\r\nby a perpendicular shaft, yet without the beds having participated in\r\nthe movement.” Full of this important subject he wrote fully on it.\r\n\r\n“In order to appreciate the distinctive character of this colossal\r\nmoraine, you must reflect on the uniformity and evenness of the vast\r\nplain of the Po all round it, for, although really inclined from the\r\nAlps, it looks as level as the sea; then fancy the great mounds sloping\r\nup at angles of 20° and 30° to heights of 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000\r\nfeet; then consider that at the very extremity, as near Caluso, there\r\nare blocks of protogine which have come one hundred miles from Mont\r\nBlanc; also that the whole assemblage of stones is not like that which\r\nhas issued from the Susa, or from any other valley, but confined to\r\nrocks such as now strictly belong to the basin of the Dora Baltea; also\r\nthat the pebbles and fragments of stone, if of serpentine or any easily\r\nstriable rock, are all striated, at least nineteen-twentieths of the\r\nwhole, whereas in a recent glacier which has only travelled ten miles,\r\nyou might only find one in twenty of the same stone striated; and lastly,\r\nthink of the narrow vomitory which has disgorged this enormous quantity\r\nof material, the ravine above Ivrea being as obviously the source of the\r\nwhole, as is the crater of Vesuvius the point from which its lavas have\r\nissued. When Gastaldi read his paper to the Geological Society at Paris,\r\nwritten jointly by him and Martens, Elie de Beaumont, who had many years\r\nbefore visited the ground, objected entirely to their conclusion that it\r\nwas a moraine, but I never saw a stronger or more satisfactory case.\r\nBut in the same paper the authors hazarded an opinion that although the\r\nold Alpine moraines stopped short after going a few leagues from the\r\nAlps, yet at some former time erratics had been conveyed to the summit\r\nof the Collina, just as “Pierre à Bot” and other blocks had been carried\r\nby the old Rhone glacier to the flanks of the Jura. Now when I read this\r\nat Zurich, I immediately recollected that in the valley of the Bormida,\r\nwhen I passed from Savona to Alessandria in 1828, I had been astonished\r\nat some very huge erratics of serpentine in the Miocene. Having never\r\nseen blocks of such enormous dimensions in any tertiary formation, I was\r\nrelieved in 1828 at finding, in some spots on the Bormida, projecting\r\nfragments of serpentine in places which the erosion of the valleys had\r\nexposed to view. I concluded that they may not have travelled far, and\r\nwhen I saw some large blocks on the Superga (in 1828), I immediately\r\nsuspected that as that hill consisted of beds of the same formation,\r\nthe blocks might have been washed out of the Miocene not far off. I\r\ntherefore now suggested this view to Gastaldi, and found that he was\r\nby no means tenacious of his printed theory, although he said that the\r\nblocks were many of them angular, of very great size, and accompanied\r\nby Alpine loam. We then examined the beds of the Superga, both those\r\ndipping to the north-west, and those to the south-east, and on both\r\nsides of this anticlinal are strata containing fragments of stone of\r\nvarious kinds, some not known in the neighbouring Alps or Apennines,\r\nfrom two to eight feet in diameter. On our ascent to the Superga I saw\r\na thickness of sixty feet regularly stratified of this conglomerate,\r\nin which were fragments consisting chiefly of serpentine, but some of\r\nlimestone, others of protogine granite, and one of the latter angular\r\nand eight feet in diameter. In less than half an hour’s search, I found\r\ntwo of the serpentine and one of the limestone pebbles with scratches,\r\nwhich would be called glacial if they were found in a modern moraine,\r\nthough not such as you would select for examples for a museum. Still I\r\nsearched this year in some recent moraines quite as long without finding\r\nbetter. As to the age of the beds, there is no doubt of their belonging\r\nto the Lower Miocene, the marine fossils of which we collected in strata\r\nboth below and above them. These enormous blocks, therefore, were brought\r\ninto their present position by causes which acted in the Miocene age. I\r\nknow of no agency but that of ice which could have quietly let them down\r\nupon subjacent beds of undisturbed fine marl and sand. Hence I conclude\r\nthat there was floating ice in the Lower Miocene period, and if the\r\nfew scratches I saw really imply glacial striation, the ice-rafts were\r\nprobably derived from glaciers which came down from mountains bordering\r\nthe glacial sea; perhaps from the Alps, for that chain must have existed\r\nbefore the origin of a large part of the Lower Miocene. I have kept the\r\nspecimens I found of these Miocene striated stones to show Ramsay, who\r\nwill be interested in hearing, that in spite of some Brazilian genera of\r\ntrees and insects, and not a few palms, and some reptiles of good size,\r\nand many other fossil genera found on both sides of the Alps and supposed\r\nto imply a subtropical climate, I am not afraid to appeal to ice as the\r\nonly known cause capable of stratifying these great masses in the manner\r\nin which they occur.”\r\n\r\nThe evidence of former changes in climate was thus strongly impressed on\r\nLyell’s mind, and the astonishing truth began to be strongly impressed\r\nupon geologists by him, that not only has the area of Europe witnessed\r\nages of tropical heat, but also ages of considerable winter’s cold, and\r\nthat there has been more than one glacial period.\r\n\r\nLyell visited Vesuvius and Etna in 1858, and how carefully he noticed\r\nevery detail of the mountain structure, and how little he cared about\r\n“roughing it” may be gleaned from extracts from his diary sent to his\r\nwife:—\r\n\r\n“Etna, _Casa Inglese_, Sept. 21, 1858.—Got off with two guides and two\r\nmuleteers and four mules, at half past seven, in bright sunshine, from\r\nNicolosi, and after a beautiful sunny ride of three hours through wooded\r\ncraters, protected from the heat by my umbrella, was gradually enveloped\r\nin clouds. I saw a lava stream where the oaks had been surrounded by\r\nlava, which had taken the form both of upright and prostrate trunks,\r\nsurrounding them with tuff, and the wood being burned up they are now\r\ncylinders of scoriaceous lava. After a couple of hours we got above the\r\nclouds, when about eight thousand feet high, but not till my hands were\r\nnumbed, for I could not believe for a long time in the necessity of my\r\nputting on a cloak. After reaching this place, I set out with Angelo for\r\nthe top of Etna, leaving Guiseppe to cook. We had now and then a drifting\r\ncloud, but on the whole splendid sunshine. I saw the spot at the foot of\r\nthe great line where the Catanians quarried ice from under a current of\r\nlava. My guide saw the same thing some six years ago, while the eruption\r\nof 1852 was in progress, in August and September: the sand and lava ten\r\nfeet thick, and four feet of ice below, and bottom not seen. Not far\r\nabove the ice I warmed my hands at a fumarole where the steam and some\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen were given off at such a heat that I was obliged\r\nto be careful how I put my fingers in. This welcome heat enabled me to\r\nwrite. When we reached the edge of the crater the whole of Sicily was\r\nhidden except the higher part of Etna, between us and Montagunoli. But\r\nLipari and Stromboli stood out in the sea very conspicuously. I made a\r\nrough sketch of the two craters; the smaller one has lately, I believe,\r\nfallen, and shows a section of some of the horizontal beds of lava,\r\nwith which it had been filled nearly to the top. It was a considerable\r\nexertion climbing and going half round it after a seven hours’ ride,\r\nand this makes the Casa Inglese, which is the roughest place I was ever\r\nin, seem a hospitable mansion, as it saves our returning. The wind is\r\nwhistling round and somewhat through it, but Dr. Guiseppe, I hear, has\r\nmade it weather tight. There is no chimney and we have charcoal burners,\r\nbut if the wind always blows like this I am not, at any rate, guaranteed\r\nfrom asphyxia.”\r\n\r\nHe got a list of one hundred and fifty shells of the newer pliocene\r\nclay on which Etna rests. Nine-tenths of them he found were of species\r\nbelonging to the present floor of the Mediterranean Sea, and this, to his\r\ndelight, confirmed what he wrote, and what has already been alluded to,\r\nregarding this deposit on a former occasion. At Bronte, Lyell saw the\r\nplace where a crowd assembled in 1842, to see the lava flow into a great\r\nartificial reservoir of water. The torrent of melted stone came forward\r\nwith a front of more than thirty feet high, and falling suddenly into the\r\nwater, produced for a while no effect whatever, as if, as in the white\r\nhot metal in Butigny’s experiment, it required to cool down before it\r\ncould cause explosion. At length it went off suddenly, and everybody but\r\none or two out of fifty or more in number was killed.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of his journeys in America and Europe, Lyell had paid\r\nspecial attention to the changes which were occurring on the surface of\r\nthe earth amongst the rocks and hills, valleys, rivers, and sea-shores.\r\nHe had dealt with inanimate nature largely. About the year 1859 he began\r\nto consider the changes which have occurred in the living things of the\r\npast, and to direct his attention to the subject of the antiquity of man\r\nand to the possible origin of species. He wrote to a friend in his usual\r\nhalf-jesting manner: “I have been much occupied with another geological\r\nsubject besides that which your niece, Ellen Twisleton, irreverently\r\ncalls the proving her to be first cousin to a turnip (a violet she\r\nshould have said); I mean the antiquity of man as implied by the flint\r\nhatchets of Amiens, undoubtedly contemporaneous with the mammoth, and\r\nalso the human skeletons of certain caves near Liège, which I believe to\r\nbe of corresponding age. I regard the pyramids as things of yesterday in\r\ncomparison of those relics.” Lyell struggled long in his mind against the\r\ntheory of the great age of man on the earth, and converted himself to\r\nthe belief in it, and in 1861 he wrote, after examining the associated\r\nremains of human art and extinct animals, such as the mammoth and hairy\r\nrhinoceros in England, that “the late discoveries at Herne Bay and\r\nReculver convince me that man inhabited England when the Thames was a\r\ntributary of the Rhine.” He published a work on the antiquity of man,\r\nand then began to interest himself about the great age when ice reigned\r\nsupreme over much of the northern hemisphere. Writing to his nephew he\r\nstates: “On a hill called Moel Tryfaen (in North Wales), at a height of\r\nthirteen hundred feet above the sea, I found twenty species of fossil\r\nshells, all of living species, in sand and gravel fifty feet thick. You\r\nwould have known most of them familiarly.” Some of these shells were\r\nof kinds now living close by in the sea, but others of kinds now living\r\nwithin the arctic circle. “The shells show that Snowdon and all the\r\nhighest hills which are in the neighbourhood of Moel Tryfaen were mere\r\nislands in the sea at a comparatively late period, or when these living\r\nmolluscs were flourishing.”\r\n\r\nThe researches of Lyell and Dawson in Nova Scotia have been noticed, and\r\nit is interesting to know that they were rewarded by the discovery of an\r\nair-breathing mollusc, and of several small amphibians of the age of the\r\ncoal period, in the hollow of a stump of a tree, which dated back to that\r\nvery ancient time. After the death of his friend Murchison, although the\r\neffects of age and a life of hard study were not unfelt, Lyell followed\r\nwith great care the researches of Dr. Hicks relating to the oldest rocks\r\nof England. Lyell was intensely interested at the discovery of highly\r\norganized invertebrate animals in sandstones and shales, which hitherto\r\nhad only yielded some doubtful worm tracks and impressions of plants,\r\nand he recognized the truth that no evidences of the beginning of living\r\nthings were presented to the geologist. The researches of Carpenter,\r\nThomson, and Agassiz concerning the natural philosophy and natural\r\nhistory of the deep sea were gratefully acknowledged by Lyell, as most\r\nimportant contributions to science, and the author of this memoir has a\r\nlively remembrance of Sir Charles’s intense excitement when the news\r\nfirst came that the sea was very cold at great depths.\r\n\r\nYears passed on, and honours came to the hard-working, truth-loving\r\nman. He was elected president of the British Association, and was made\r\na baronet. His sight began to fail, and it was a constant anxiety to\r\nmany who saw him about London, to witness his constant exposure to\r\ndanger. Availing himself of an excellent secretary, he still corresponded\r\nlargely, and attended scientific meetings. But the end was at hand, and\r\nhe lost his well-loved wife and then his brother. Dying from the results\r\nof a fall, Lyell was buried in Westminster Abbey, as a representative man\r\nof science. He was a brilliant example of a man who sought out truth, and\r\nbraved public opinion for its sake, and who enlightened the world, caring\r\nlittle for ease and luxury, and assisting every fellow-labourer in the\r\ngreat science of geology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The greater part of this memoir is taken from Miss Brightwell’s “Life\r\nof Linnæus.” Van Voorst.\r\n\r\n[2] Terebratulæ.\r\n\r\n[3] A large Echinite (_Clypeus sinuatus_ of Leske), not unfrequently\r\nemployed as a “pound-weight” by the dairywomen.\r\n\r\n[4] Named from its frequent use in the construction of ovens.\r\n\r\n[5] Written by his biographer.\r\n\r\n[6] Address to the Geological Society, at the Anniversary Meeting, Feb.\r\n18, 1831, by the President, the Rev.
