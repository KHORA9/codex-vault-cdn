C.F.D._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Start in Life.=\r\n\r\n\r\nI have entitled this little book \"A Start in Life,\" because it conveys\r\ninformation which would enable any person possessing a small capital,\r\nwith some industry, patience, and steady habits, to make a start in life\r\nwhich, humanly speaking, could not fail of success.\r\n\r\nThe old countries of Europe contain a superabundant population; every\r\nbranch of professional and commercial life is so overcrowded, that there\r\nexists a competition so keen, as to reduce the incomes of the largest,\r\nand, in many cases, to prevent the smallest workers, in whatever sphere,\r\nfrom getting a remunerative return for the activities of brain, muscle,\r\nand money.\r\n\r\nTo inform the public, therefore, how a young man may make a first start\r\nin life, or an older man a fresh start in life, is offering an advantage\r\nwhich, I doubt not, will be appreciated by many who read these pages.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to hear the objection that, in the proposals set forth\r\nherein, I am seeking a personal advantage as Agent for the sale of the\r\nlands at Merced, in California, that I refer to, and I meet it with this\r\nstatement: Let the objector consider his prospects of success in the\r\nplace where he now is, and if they are reasonably good, let him stay\r\nthere; if they are not, then let him intelligently consider what his\r\ncapabilities are--whether he has any special or technical knowledge,\r\nand, if so, in what place he can expect the best return for a full use\r\nof his talents. If any opening appears probable in any of the old\r\ncountries, he will, perhaps, first consider that; but if he can see no\r\nopening at home, then let him consider, by careful investigation, the\r\nmore distant fields; let him learn all he can about all the British\r\nColonies, and other countries, and especially Canada and the United\r\nStates, as being nearest to Great Britain. Having learnt something\r\ngenerally of these distant places, then, having regard to his own\r\nabilities and capital, and his personal desires as to distance from the\r\nOld Country, climate, &c., he should make his choice as to which of the\r\nplaces he has read of seems most likely to give him a fair prospect of\r\nsuccess; and then, having come to this decision, he should learn all he\r\ncan about that particular place. I admit that I shall receive a\r\npersonal benefit by persons settling at Merced, in California; but--I\r\nsay this with great confidence--if, after an intelligent consideration\r\nof other places, any person, desiring a start in life, comes to the\r\nconclusion that Fruit culture in California is an occupation, and a\r\ncountry, that would suit him, then let him consider all the places in\r\nCalifornia where openings for this occupation are presented, and let him\r\nchoose which of them he considers most suitable; and, at the risk of\r\nappearing invidious, I would add that he should not believe all he\r\nreads, but should make his examination and inquiries for himself, on the\r\nspot. I do not ask him blindly to believe what is set forth in these\r\npages, but if he thinks that California is a suitable place of\r\nsettlement for him, then I do say, with great emphasis, that he should\r\nnot settle upon anything in California until he has been to Merced, and\r\nproved for himself that the statements are credible. After he has been\r\nto Merced, I have little doubt that he will be convinced that that place\r\npresents an opening which would be worth his decision.\r\n\r\nIf he proceed to California by the Southern Pacific Railway, he could\r\nbreak his journey at the various other places of Fruit culture\r\nsettlement, and inspect them, reaching Merced last, as the nearest to\r\nthe great centre of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nA careful comparison of the various fields of Fruit culture enterprise\r\nwill, I am assured, show him that Merced possesses peculiar advantages.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the great drawback of California is want of water;\r\nand intending settlers must not be satisfied by the statements of\r\nagents, or owners, that their lands have water advantages, but they must\r\nsatisfy themselves that they can have water by irrigation (not by the\r\nexpensive, laborious process of pumping it up from uncertain springs),\r\nand in such a quantity as to be permanent.\r\n\r\nAt some places lands now supplied by irrigation will fall short\r\npresently, when the owners carry the water on to thousands of adjoining\r\nacres; therefore, a full and permanent supply of water is an essential.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIAL ADVANTAGES\r\n\r\nmy clients offer settlers at Merced are:--\r\n\r\n1. A permanent supply of Water, for a perpetual water right accompanies\r\nevery lot of land sold.\r\n\r\n2. Contiguity to a Railway Station on the main line, and to a Town,\r\nwith commercial, professional, educational, social and religious\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\n3. Instruction in Fruit culture gratis by a specialist, who is paid by\r\nmy clients to instruct settlers on their lands.\r\n\r\n4. A rich Soil, of which, on another page, an analysis is given.\r\n\r\n5. A ready Market for produce. Buyers come round the country and\r\npurchase the crops as they are on the trees, taking upon themselves the\r\npicking and packing. The Continent of North America is a sufficient\r\nmarket in itself for all time especially considering that its population\r\nincreases nearly a million and a half a year.\r\n\r\n6. The prices range from 75 dollars to 150 dollars per acre. At some\r\nother places in California, land is offered at a less price, but I can\r\nsell some land at even 10 dollars per acre; yet that at 100 dollars per\r\nacre is far cheaper, having regard to its advantages. Our land at 150\r\ndollars per acre will favourably compare with lands fetching much higher\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n7. Free Conveyances will be given, with a perfectly clear and\r\nsatisfactory title.\r\n\r\n8. Two-thirds of the purchase-money may remain on\r\nmortgage.\r\n\r\n9. Merced is only 14 days from London.\r\n\r\n10. A liberal competence may be secured by a reasonably industrious\r\nsettler.\r\n\r\n11. Merced is a very healthy locality, and is nearer to San Francisco\r\nthan other Fruit growing centres.\r\n\r\n12. My clients, the owners, are well-known gentlemen of wealth and\r\nposition in California, and not irresponsible land speculators, members\r\nof a syndicate with an unknown personality.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON AND WARNING.\r\n\r\nI have already said that applicants should verify for themselves the\r\nstatements made by persons who, like myself, would be personally\r\nbenefited by their settling upon the lands offered for sale. Letters\r\nsent to this country, and advertised by agents as a guarantee of\r\nadvantages, written by persons soon after arrival in California, and who\r\nhave not compared the place of their location with other places, can\r\nscarcely be a sufficient recommendation. Some parts of California\r\nadvertised in this country for sale have not a permanent water supply;\r\nare too hot; are swept by winds; are at a considerable distance from a\r\nrailway station; have a poor, sandy soil, some even mixed with alkali;\r\nand some are so situated as to be \"notoriously unhealthy,\" and produce\r\nchills, fevers, and general malaria, and, in one case, I have heard of\r\nan embarrassed title: therefore, I say that intending settlers should\r\nremember there is a California and a California--that it is not all gold\r\nwhich glitters, and that they should, personally and intelligently,\r\ninvestigate for themselves, on the spot, the statements made by those\r\nwho, at a distance, offer the lands for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPITAL REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that settlers intending to establish Fruit farms,\r\nshould have a capital of from £600 upwards; but those who have a smaller\r\ncapital--say, £300, or even £100--may, in other ways, find some opening\r\nfor employing it, if accompanied with intelligent, industrious,\r\npersevering work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Start in Life.=\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ensure the stability of a building the foundation ought to be\r\nsubstantial, so in like manner a good start in life goes a great way\r\ntowards ensuring a successful career. By success I do not mean the\r\nmaking of a rapid fortune by leaps and bounds of prosperity, but I do\r\nmean an ultimate prosperity, acquired through patient, persevering, and\r\nintelligent labour. To make a large fortune quickly it is necessary to\r\nhave command of the requisite knowledge of the business in hand, the\r\nrequisite capital, untiring energy, and a trait of genius. Beyond these\r\nit would be necessary to have the mind absorbed in the one thing, and\r\ntherefore, supposing one possessed the requisites, would it be worth\r\nwhile to sacrifice all else to the mere accumulation of money? To live\r\nfor mere money making is a grovelling existence, and utterly unworthy\r\nthe aim of any man possessing the finer instincts of human nature and\r\nthe intelligence with which it is endowed.\r\n\r\nNo, I am not pretending to offer the means of making a rapid\r\nfortune--such accidents fall to the lot of but few out of the millions\r\nof our species--but I do claim to be able to offer to men willing to\r\nlive a steady industrious life, the opportunity of acquiring, on easy\r\nterms, a small freehold estate, into which they can put the golden seed\r\nof their own mental and physical effort with the certainty of reaping a\r\ngolden harvest proportionate to their area, their ability, and their\r\nindustry; for when once a Fruit farm is planted it increases in value\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nTo own a freehold estate of 20, 40, or 100 acres, with a comfortable\r\nhouse and buildings, and the land well stocked with choice Fruits, with\r\na ready market, presents a prospect, by the use of a small capital, with\r\nthe addition of muscle and brains, of future competence. When such a\r\nproperty is fully matured, labour can be hired, and one's own personal\r\nenergies may be diverted, if preferred, into other channels, or\r\ncontinued in the same with largely accumulating benefits.\r\n\r\nI ask my readers requiring for themselves, or others in whom they are\r\ninterested, a start in life, to read these pages carefully, for I do not\r\nknow any calling, in the old or new world, where a small capitalist fond\r\nof country life could find an occupation more congenial than the one I\r\noffer at Merced, in California, and which is described herein.\r\n\r\nResidence near to a young town, which will probably increase rapidly in\r\nvalue, and which now possesses extensive commercial, locomotive, social\r\nand religious advantages, a climate than which the surface of this globe\r\nscarcely presents one more desirable, a fortnight's journey from London,\r\nand a soil pregnant with inherent virtue, are amongst the considerations\r\nof importance which will determine thoughtful investors to settle at\r\nMerced.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to show to applicants samples of the soils and fruits, and\r\nalso views, books, maps, &c., and to answer questions, if they will call\r\npersonally upon me, at my offices--\r\n\r\n    3, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London,\r\n\r\nso that they may have every assistance in enabling them to come to a\r\ndecision as to whether the start in life I offer them at Merced, in\r\nCalifornia, is one suitable in respect of their inclination, capital,\r\nabilities, and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHIN A FORTNIGHT OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nTo prove the convenient access of this land, called \"British Colony\"\r\nfrom London, I may say that on November 22nd, 1890, I left Liverpool in\r\nthe Cunard steamer \"Etruria,\" which reached New York on the following\r\nSaturday evening, just too late for the Custom-house officers to examine\r\nthe luggage, so that we could not go on shore till the next morning. I\r\nstayed over the Sunday (26 hours) in New York, leaving on Monday by the\r\nfirst overland train, and after calling at innumerable stations, and\r\nstaying 14 hours at Chicago and Council Bluffs, to \"make connections\"\r\n(_i.e._, catch other trains), and staying 52 hours at San Francisco, I\r\narrived at Merced at 10.23 on Monday night, December 8th, _i.e._, say 16\r\ndays 6 hours after leaving Liverpool. Had I have left Liverpool by the\r\nWednesday instead of the Saturday steamer, I should not have needed to\r\nhave stayed over Sunday in New York, and, of course, there would be no\r\nnecessity for a settler to stay at San Francisco (I had to meet my\r\nclients there); therefore, deducting these two stoppages of 78 hours, or\r\n3-1/4 days, it would give 13 days to Merced in the _winter_ season. In\r\nfine weather the journey could be made in less time; some steamers, in\r\nthe summer and autumn months, have crossed from Liverpool to New York in\r\nabout six days, so that the journey _could_ be made, in favourable\r\ncircumstances, in say 12 to 13 days, but we may safely put it at 14\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nI went by the Northern Prairies and Rocky Mountains, and returned by the\r\nlonger route of Southern California, the Desert of Arizona, the Plains\r\nof Texas, through the sugar and cotton districts of the Southern States,\r\nand thence, viâ New Orleans and Washington, back to New York.\r\n\r\nThus, after remaining eight days at Merced, where I was fully engaged\r\neach day in inspecting the lands for sale and the country around for\r\nmany miles, and after allowing for stoppages on the return journey over\r\nSundays, and waiting three days at New York for the Cunard steamer\r\n\"Servia,\" I reached Liverpool on January 4th, and was back again in my\r\noffice on Monday, January 5th, being six weeks, one day and 22 hours\r\nfrom the time I rose from my chair in my office to the time I was\r\nsitting in it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Across America.=\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON TO CHICAGO.\r\n\r\nTravelling in generations past was an important event in one's life, but\r\nnow a journey across an ocean and a continent is a very commonplace\r\naffair. Books of travel used to be read with avidity, but now that so\r\nmany persons travel, and the wires keep us in touch with all the world\r\nevery day, the history of a journey is a small event, and one which to\r\nthose not specially interested would scarcely perhaps be read;\r\nnevertheless, as some of my readers may have to go over some of the\r\nground I have recently traversed, I have no doubt that a reference to my\r\njourney to California and back would be of interest to them, and\r\ntherefore I will give up some time and space to the subject.\r\n\r\nThis little record of my journey may perhaps be better received if I\r\nstate that I am not a novice in travel, and that before I had turned\r\ntwenty-one years of age I had been to Australia (calling _en route_ at\r\nPernambuco in South America), and that while in Australia I visited\r\nMelbourne, Sydney, Geelong, King George's Sound, besides various inland\r\ntowns and gold fields, including Bendigo, Castlemaine, Tarrangower,\r\nFryer's Creek, Forest Creek, Campbell's Creek, Tarradale, Maryborough,\r\netc., and various other places, and sheep and cattle stations. From\r\nAustralia I went to Aden (the inland town) and up the Red Sea to Suez,\r\nreturning to Australia, and thence to England. Since I commenced\r\nbusiness in England, in 1859, I went in 1862 to St. Thomas' in the West\r\nIndies, thence to Aspinwall, across the Isthmus to Panama, thence to\r\nAcapulco in Mexico, on to San Francisco in California, and thence to\r\nVancouver Island, returning by the same route as far as Aspinwall,\r\nwhence I went to New York. In 1865 I went on business to Russia.\r\nArriving at the ancient city of Pskov, I proceeded across country to the\r\nestate of my client, the Count Bogouschefsky, at one time private\r\nSecretary to the Emperor Nicholas (grandfather of the present Czar).\r\nSome of these travels were attended with a good deal of adventure; but\r\nmy recent journey from England to California and back, 13,774 miles, in\r\nsix weeks (including all stoppages), was all work, for my time was\r\noccupied continuously in reading up the country, learning from old\r\nsettlers, and making notes of what I saw, some of which I have found\r\nroom for in the following pages.\r\n\r\nOn November 22nd, 1890, I was at work in my office in Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields, whence a cab depositing me at Euston, the 10.10 express train\r\nsoon ran me down to Liverpool (201 miles), whence a steam \"tender\" took\r\nme from the landing-stage to the Cunard steamship \"Etruria,\" some two\r\nmiles off, where I was soon comfortably located in my \"state room\" (No.\r\n42).\r\n\r\nIt was nearly 5 o'clock before we got away, and the next day found us at\r\nQueenstown Harbour, where we lost considerable time in waiting for the\r\nmail. At length the mail, which was a heavy one, was safely on board,\r\nand off we went, head on to the Atlantic. During that night of the 23rd\r\nwe experienced a heavy gale; big seas broke over the forecastle, and\r\nflooded the decks below, through the ventilators. The A.B.'s declined\r\nventuring on the forecastle to unship these great ventilators, and so\r\nthe engines had to be slowed down, and the ship stopped; the ventilators\r\nwere then unshipped, and we proceeded. The night was a bad one, and the\r\nnext morning we had not got through it, and as a consequence the decks\r\nwere like lagoons; but presently we had run through it, or it had run\r\naway from us, or had expended its energy, and we were in comparatively\r\nsmooth waters, and had a comfortable run to New York. Nothing of\r\nparticular interest occurred during the passage. I sought and found the\r\nold American settlers amongst the passengers, and obtained from them all\r\nthe information I could of the country, and especially the State to\r\nwhich I was going. I read \"General\" Booth's \"Darkest England,\" and wrote\r\na review of it, which duly appeared in the \"Land Roll.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Etruria\" is a fine ship. She has a commodious saloon, music and\r\nreading room, plenty of deck space for exercise, comfortable cabins,\r\nbath rooms, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th we made Sandy Hook Lighthouse, which is about 20 miles from\r\nNew York Dock, but we got in too late for the Custom-house officers to\r\nlook at our baggage, so we lay all night in the harbour, and next\r\nmorning commenced the tedious process of creeping up, yard by yard, into\r\nour berth at the dock. The run from Liverpool was thus:--Liverpool to\r\nQueenstown, on the 22nd and 23rd, 240 miles; 24th, at noon, 330 miles;\r\n25th, 454; 26th, 462; 27th, 475; 28th, 480; 29th, 471; distance to\r\nSandy Hook Lighthouse, 130 miles; so that the run totals up to 3,042,\r\nand with the 20 miles added, 3,062 miles.\r\n\r\nI had been recommended by a passenger to go to the Hotel St. Stephen, 46\r\nto 52, East Eleventh Street, New York, whence I drove in a cab perhaps a\r\nmile and a half, for which the cabman wanted 2 dollars (equal to 8s.\r\n4d.); he got 1-1/2, which was half-a-dollar too much. Passengers should\r\ndrive to their hotel, and then ask the proper fare before paying. New\r\nYork has many large hotels--this is comparatively a small one. All the\r\nwaiters are coloured men, and this seems pretty general throughout\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nI stayed over the 30th (Sunday) in New York, by which I secured a quiet\r\nday and an opportunity to attend Divine service. In my bedroom was a\r\ncoil of stout Manilla rope screwed into the floor, near a window, so\r\nthat an escape might be secured in the event of fire. The towels\r\nprovided are a kind of compromise between a duster and a pocket\r\nhandkerchief--rather disappointing to one accustomed to his \"tub.\" New\r\nYork is great in tram-cars, worked by horses, mules, and electricity,\r\nalso elevated railways--that is, railways running down the streets on\r\nhuge tressels or scaffolding--so that the vehicles go underneath them,\r\nand the passengers in the train look straight into the first-floor\r\nwindows of the houses on the other side. There is an immense development\r\nof electricity all over America, and in tram-cars, railway-cars, hotels,\r\nhouses, everything and everywhere, is the electric light prominent. Many\r\nof the streets are unevenly paved. Blacking boots is a profession in\r\nAmerica--in many hotels a special charge is made for it, or else the\r\nvisitors are left to their own devices thereon--and boot-blacks have\r\nshops and nooks fitted with high, huge easy chairs, elevated like\r\nthrones, where their clients can comfortably repose during the operation\r\nof polish.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, December 1st, I was up early, and made enquiries at\r\nthe various offices representing the railway lines to Chicago, with the\r\nresult that I took a ticket by the Pennsylvania route, and left New York\r\nat 10 o'clock a.m. The train service between New York and Chicago is one\r\nof the best, if not _the_ best, in America. The cars are elegantly\r\nfitted; they are about the length of the Pullman cars we have in\r\nEngland. The best cars are those fitted with sleeping accommodation, and\r\ntravellers having tickets for a \"sleeper\" have the privilege of using\r\nthe sleeping car during the day. The sleeping cars are divided into\r\nsquares capable of seating four persons, but the space is accorded to\r\ntwo only, as only two beds or berths can be made up in the space; the\r\nlower berth (which is always the favourite) is formed of the two double\r\nseats (the space for four seats), filled up in the centre by special\r\nfittings and mattresses, hidden during the day inside the seats; the\r\nupper berth is pulled down from the sloping roof of the car, and in the\r\nreceptacle between the slope and the square are contained the bedding\r\nand the fittings. A curtain falls down over both the upper and lower\r\nberths, and, so far as one can, the dressing has to be done with the\r\ncurtain hanging round one as one stands within it; and if on both sides\r\nof the car passengers happen to stand behind their respective curtains\r\nat the same time, they would touch one another and so block the\r\npassage-way. The dressing accommodation is so inconvenient that only\r\npartial undressing is adopted. The outside of the slope is polished\r\nmahogany, and in the daytime bears no indication whatever of what it\r\nreally is, but looks like a handsome sloping polished mahogany roof.\r\nThese cars are luxuriously fitted. Another car on the train is a\r\nhandsome dining saloon, with kitchen attached, where you can order as\r\ngood a dinner as you could obtain at an hotel. The cars are also fitted\r\nliberally with lavatories and water-closets, separate ones for ladies\r\nand for gentlemen. On this train is also a bath-room and a barber's\r\nshop. There are also one or two small private rooms, which can be hired\r\nseparately. This train has also a recent addition, being what is called\r\na drawing-room or observation car; this is the last on the train, and\r\nthe end is fitted with glass, so that in riding along passengers in this\r\ncar enjoy an uninterrupted view of the country they are leaving behind.\r\nOn this special train a ladies' maid is provided for the convenience of\r\nladies, and a stenographer, with his type-writing machine, occupies a\r\nseat in the vestibule of the drawing-room car to take down any urgent\r\nletters which business men may desire to post _en route_. The\r\nobservation car is supplied with a library for the use of passengers,\r\nand is fitted with plate-glass windows and easy chairs. It has a\r\nplatform where one can breathe the fresh air outside if desired. There\r\nis also a smoking-room car. On this special train the Stock Exchange\r\nreports of the New York and Philadelphia Exchanges are received and\r\nposted on the bulletin boards three times a day, and the weather reports\r\nare also posted. The whole of the train is thoroughly well heated by\r\nsteam pipes, and lighted by electricity. The person in charge of a\r\n\"sleeper\" car is called the \"porter;\" he occupies a position, not like a\r\nporter on an English railway, but analagous to a steward on board ship.\r\n\r\nOn leaving New York I noticed that the suburbs contained many very small\r\nwooden houses, and the country had the appearance of many Colonial\r\nscenes I have witnessed--the land looked like reclaimed prairie, which\r\nit probably is; and after passing many homesteads and villages we ran\r\ninto Philadelphia at 12.20. Philadelphia is the largest city, as to\r\narea, in the United States. It is situate on the west bank of the\r\nDelaware River. It is 22 miles long, and from 5 to 8 broad, comprising\r\nan area of 1,294 square miles. It has over 900 miles of paved streets.\r\nPhiladelphia was founded by the celebrated William Penn, who went from\r\nEngland to America in 1682 A.D., and purchased the site of this great\r\ncity from the Indians. William Penn's character was remarkable for his\r\nhigh sense of honour, and if the same principle had obtained throughout\r\nthe history of the United States with the Indians, we should never have\r\nheard of any \"Indian Difficulty.\" Penn presented the city with a charter\r\nin 1701. The city, built upon lands honestly and liberally bought from\r\nthe Indians, prospered greatly, and its population continued to increase\r\nuntil it now reaches something approaching 900,000. Its chief source of\r\nwealth is from its manufactures, which embrace locomotives, and all\r\nkinds of ironware, ships, carpets, woollen and cotton goods, shoes,\r\numbrellas, and books. It has more buildings than any other city in that\r\ncountry, and, in point of commerce, ranks fourth among the cities of the\r\nUnited States. I noticed that the suburbs of Philadelphia contained many\r\nhandsome stone and brick residences. I felt much interested in the\r\nconnection with William Penn, because he is one of the ancestors of the\r\nPenn-Gaskells of England, who for many years have been valuable and\r\nmuch-respected clients of mine, and in numerous transactions I have\r\nnoticed in them that beautiful trait of strict honour which gave William\r\nPenn a world-wide character, and has descended from him to them.\r\n\r\nPassing by many farm homesteads, villages, and towns, all having a\r\nprosperous kind of appearance, and described as \"one of the richest\r\nagricultural districts in America,\" we ran into Harrisburg, which is the\r\ncapital of Pennsylvania, and situate on the east bank of the Susquehanna\r\nRiver. About five miles above Harrisburg we crossed the Susquehanna\r\nRiver on a bridge 3,670 feet long, from the centre of which I am told\r\nthere is a fine view, but I lost it, as a snowstorm was raging while I\r\nwas crossing.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at Altoona, a large city lying at the foot of the\r\nAlleghanies, and in ascending the Alleghanies fine scenery and great\r\nengineering feats are discernible. From this we ran on to Pittsburg,\r\nwhich claims to be the best lighted city in America, the streets being\r\nbrilliantly illuminated by arc and incandescent electric lights. Nine\r\nbridges cross the Allegheny, and five the Monongahela rivers. Pittsburg\r\nhas been called the \"iron city,\" and \"smoky city\"; it has immense glass,\r\nsteel and iron manufactures, and in these three interests alone employs\r\nover 50,000 persons.\r\n\r\nThen we proceed till, presently, we catch sight of Lake Michigan, and\r\nknow that Chicago is not far off. We skirt the shore of this busy water,\r\nwith its wharves, etc. On arrival (December 2nd) we drive through the\r\ncity from the Pennsylvania to the North-Western terminus.\r\n\r\nChicago is 912 miles from New York: it is the greatest city in Illinois,\r\nand during the past 50 years has grown from a small Indian trading\r\nstation into a metropolis. Chicago extends some 20 miles along the\r\nshores of Lake Michigan, and goes back from the lake to a depth of about\r\nfour miles, thus embracing about 80 square miles; beyond these confines\r\nof the city proper the suburbs extend to some 6 to 10 miles in every\r\ndirection. It will be remembered that in 1871 Chicago had a great fire,\r\nwhich burned an area of 3-1/8 square miles, destroyed 17,450 buildings,\r\nmade 98,500 persons homeless, and killed outright about 200 more. The\r\nloss of property was estimated at 190,000,000 dollars, of which only\r\n30,000,000 dollars were recovered from insurances, and this bankrupted\r\nsome of the insurance companies. In 1874 another fire consumed 5,000,000\r\ndollars' worth of property. Chicago is the great central depôt for\r\ngrain, lumber and live stock. In 1888 there were packed at Chicago\r\n4,500,000 hogs, and about 1,600,000 cattle. Chicago has also extensive\r\niron, steel, wheel, car, flour, furniture, boot and shoe and tannery\r\nmanufactures. In driving through I noticed one long street, to the right\r\nand left of the street I was traversing, thickly occupied with\r\ntradesmen's carts, backed on the kerb in the usual fashion, being loaded\r\nfrom the stores (or shops): there must have been a few hundred of them;\r\nI never saw so many in one street at one time anywhere in any part of\r\nthe world. Chicago was cased in frozen snow, and thus was not very\r\nattractive; but I noticed many very fine buildings, and was much struck\r\nwith the cosmopolitan character of the inhabitants. During the interval\r\nof waiting for the train on the North-Western to start I was able to see\r\na little of the place, and found that some persons I spoke to could not\r\nspeak English. They came apparently from all parts of the continent of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO TO SAN FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\nThe train was due at Chicago (December 2nd) at 9.45 a.m., being exactly\r\na 23 hours and 45 minutes' run from New York. Having crossed Chicago\r\nfrom one terminus to another, I found that three trains left Chicago by\r\nwhich I could travel to San Francisco--two were slow trains, and one a\r\nfast train; but, by whichever train I went, it would make no difference\r\nas to the time I left Omaha, and consequently no difference to the time\r\nI should arrive at San Francisco, so I went on by one of the slow\r\ntrains, as I wanted to see Council Bluffs. This train was similarly\r\nfitted to the other, except that it had no drawing-room car, nor\r\nstenographer, etc., nor were the platforms connecting the carriages\r\nenclosed; so that, in passing to the dining car, or any other car, the\r\nsudden change from a hot car to a shower of snow was not pleasant. The\r\ndistance from Chicago to Omaha is 492 miles, and the country between the\r\ntwo places formed a part of the great prairie region, which, 50 years\r\nago, had no other inhabitant than the Indian and the trapper, but now is\r\na succession of homesteads, villages, and towns, bearing evidence of\r\nprosperity. At Creston, and many other stations, I noticed that there is\r\nno protection whatever from the railway; the line is unfenced, and the\r\ntrain runs through the town as openly as a coach would; there is\r\ngenerally a rough board put up here and there with the words, crudely\r\npainted on them, \"Look out for the cars!\" We were due at Council Bluffs\r\nthe next morning (December 3rd) at 7.23, but we arrived some half-hour\r\nlate. Council Bluffs Station is four miles from Omaha Station, but the\r\ntowns adjoin. The former has a population of over 35,000, and the latter\r\nof over 110,000. They are divided by the great Missouri River, which is\r\ncrossed by two bridges, one being 2,750 feet long, and the other 2,920\r\nfeet long. Having had breakfast at the station, I went up to the town by\r\nthe \"motor,\" that is, the electrical tram-car. The motor cars, like the\r\nrailway cars, are heated. I noticed a large number of detached wooden\r\ncottages, \"standing in their own grounds,\" of about one-eighth of an\r\nacre, and I learned that these are owned by labourers. Mr. Day, an agent\r\nthere, told me that the cottage would cost 500 dollars, and the land 400\r\ndollars, _i.e.,_ £100 for the house, and £80 for the land. An eighth of\r\nan acre for £80 would be £640 per acre, and this quite out in the\r\nsuburbs; and I was told that good business blocks in the town itself\r\nwould fetch £32,000 (not dollars, but pounds) per acre. In the large\r\ncities, such as New York, Chicago, etc., prices in the principal streets\r\nwould compare with prices in the City of London. Returning to the\r\nstation, I joined the express train, and crossing the Missouri River to\r\nOmaha, we proceeded west. The river was frozen at its sides, and\r\npresented no attractions worth notice. On we go through hundreds of\r\nfields of maize, always called \"corn\" in America; other grain crops,\r\nsuch as wheat, etc., are called by their own names, but the crop known\r\nonly as \"corn\" in America is maize. The rich clusters of corn are\r\ngathered, and the stalks, something in appearance between a wheat stalk\r\nand a sugar cane, are left standing for the cattle to pick over. Forty\r\nyears ago _this_ part was uninhabited by white men, and was the home of\r\ncountless buffaloes; now these animals are extirpated, and everywhere we\r\nsee nothing, for mile upon mile, but corn, corn, corn. One of my fellow\r\ntravellers was Mr. H.C. Jacobs, of Chicago, whose father-in-law was one\r\nof the pioneers, and who gave me much information. The next day\r\n(December 4th), we traverse the great rolling prairies of Nebraska, and\r\nsee many herds of horses and cattle, and here and there ranch homes and\r\ncowboys.\r\n\r\nHaving run through Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska, we commence the State\r\nof Wyoming as we pull up at the City of Cheyenne, where, in the far\r\ndistance, we see, with its peaks well clothed in snow, the grand range\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. Soon after leaving Cheyenne, we commence the\r\nascent of the Rockies--not, of course, the actual summit range itself,\r\nbut the foot hills and high lands stretching away from, and forming part\r\nof it--and as we climb the ascent terminating at Sherman, where we have\r\ngained an elevation of 8,247 feet, we pass through very wild, grand\r\nscenery. At this altitude we look down upon floating clouds, and see in\r\nthe distance Long's Peak, 14,000 feet high, towering above them. All\r\nalong, at intervals, are portable fences, placed to catch the snow as it\r\ndrifts, to prevent it blocking the line; and also what are called snow\r\nsheds, which are rough timber tunnels built up to protect the rails from\r\nthe great drifts arising out of heavy snowstorms. At the highest point\r\nis a pyramid, commemorating a certain Mr. Oakes Ames, which looked 20\r\nfeet high and very near the line; it is however, 75 feet high and\r\nhalf-a-mile off. The air is so rarefied that distances are most\r\ndeceiving.\r\n\r\nAs our descent proceeds, we catch sight, in the distance, of a herd of\r\nwild elk, and where these rolling prairies have better herbage, we see\r\nherds of horses with ranch buildings here and there. We pass the ranch\r\nof William Cody, who, by virtue of his being a Senator of the State of\r\nNebraska, is called Honourable, but who was known in London, a short\r\ntime ago, at Mr. Whitley's \"Wild West\" show as \"Buffalo Bill.\" As we\r\npass Fort Laraime, one of the forts erected by the United States\r\nGovernment as a protection against the Indians, I was told some stories\r\nof Cody's exploits against the Indians. In former days, emigrants\r\ntraversing these great prairies to found a home in this Wild West, were\r\noften harassed by Indians, and the soldiers at the fort had to protect\r\nthem. Buffalo Bill has been in many a skirmish, and, if rumour is true,\r\nmany redskins have succumbed to him; the Government took counsel with\r\nhim in all Indian difficulties in that part of the country, and the day\r\nbefore I passed his ranch he had been sent for by the authorities that\r\nthey might confer with him as to the outbreak which then existed, and\r\nwhich cost \"Sitting Bull\" his life. We passed a house cut clean in two\r\nby the wind, great herds of horses and cattle, beautiful specimens of\r\nthe bald and other eagles and vultures, some deer, and a very fine grey\r\nwolf about the size of a Newfoundland dog. The distant mountain\r\nscenery at times is very grand, and everywhere snow-capped. The air is\r\nvery pure and keen. I much enjoyed the society of two fellow travellers\r\nover this part of my journey, Mr. Lee, of General Lee's family, of\r\nVirginia, and Mr. Hurley, Solicitor to the Directors of the line we were\r\ntraversing. We passed the \"Divide of the Continent\" at an altitude of\r\n7,100 feet, which is the dividing line of the running of water; that\r\nrunning east empties into the North Platte River, thence into the\r\nMissouri, thence into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean; that\r\nrunning west empties into the Green River, thence into the Colorado,\r\nthence into the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning of December 5th we ran into Ogden, which is near\r\nSalt Lake, at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, which are snow-capped,\r\nand have some very fine peaks. Salt Lake is 126 by 45 miles, and on it\r\nis situate the great City of the Mormons. On the more fertile parts of\r\nthe prairies I gathered, at Humboldt Wells, some of the sage grass which\r\nused to be the food of the buffaloes when they existed; at other places\r\nI gathered samples of herbage on less favoured soils. As we proceed, we\r\nsee an encampment of Indians with red paint on their faces, which was\r\nput on to show sympathy with, and, if necessary, take part with other\r\ntribes of Indians, then commencing a \"war\" with the United States\r\nsoldiers. This district was not far, as distances go in America from the\r\nscene of action. Presently we commence our run through the great barren\r\nalkali plains, emerging from which we get into a more fertile country,\r\nand, at Cedar Pass, notice the great ranch of Messrs. Sparks and Tinnin,\r\nwho are reputed to have 100,000 head of cattle. Mr. Byrne, of Elko,\r\nNevada, also the owner of a large ranch, was on board the cars, and gave\r\nme some useful information. He said that cattle raising is very\r\nprofitable, as they double in number every four years, _i.e._, a profit\r\nof 25 per cent.; thus, if a man start with a 1,000 head of stock cattle,\r\nhe will have 4,000 head in four years.\r\n\r\nIf a thousand head of stock cattle were purchased off a ranch, they\r\nwould be sold just as they run, without any selection whatever--steers,\r\nheifers, cows, calves, bulls, yearlings, both sexes and all ages, but\r\ncalves which still suck their mothers are not counted, and go for\r\nnothing. Many head of cattle perish in the winter, when the land is\r\ncovered with snow, as on many large ranches no food is given them. I\r\nurged that it would pay to have stock-yards and give food during the\r\nsnow time, and Mr. Byrne said that he always did so himself, and that\r\nthe great ranch men were having their eyes opened to this necessity.\r\n\r\nWe passed various other encampments of Indians, and far from any\r\nencampment or habitation saw an Indian on the track carrying a small\r\nlight bundle, and following him a long way behind was his squaw,\r\nlabouring under a very heavy burden.\r\n\r\nDuring this day we ran through ranges of uneven mountains, rising one\r\nabove another in broken undulations and with ever-varying tops, such as\r\ntable lands, sharp conical peaks, rounded heads, and broken\r\nindentations.\r\n\r\nThe distant mountains are enveloped in snow, upon which gleams a\r\nresplendent setting sun, presenting a prospect which only such a region\r\ncould produce. From the dazzling whiteness of one range we look upon the\r\ndense darkness of another, as being out of the sun's influence. The\r\nlights and shades, the gorges, the fissures, the striations in the range\r\nupon range, with their intervals of plains and valleys, here and there\r\nopening up peeps of great tracts of country, and then again shutting\r\nall in to the circumference of their gigantic heads, interspersed with\r\nthe brilliance of rich gold, tingeing some tops and revealing dark\r\nrecesses, some ruby tints and fantastic shadows,--all combine to reflect\r\na glory which lifts the mind beyond the great heights of hills to a\r\nheight, greater still, whence originated all natural grandeur.\r\n\r\nWe had run through Utah and Nevada, and were now approaching the\r\nnorthern part of California. In the very early morning of December 6th I\r\nawoke and found that the train was at a standstill. Thinking that we\r\nwere at a station I tried to sleep again, but, finding that we continued\r\nmotionless, I went out on to the platform connecting our car with the\r\nnext and found all around was deep snow, and that another train on the\r\nother metals had broken down, and that our men were apparently helping\r\nto get it off. We were then two miles from Truckee, and at an elevation\r\nof nearly 6,000 feet. After a long delay we got away and ran into\r\nTruckee. The scenery on this day was also of a truly grand character:\r\nprecipices, declivities, chasms; and in one very romantic spot, of weird\r\nand wild mountain sides, graduating to narrow gullies, with pine and\r\nother trees, some perfect, others broken by the wind was one great\r\nwreck of a forest monster--a tree rudely snapped asunder by wind or\r\nlightning, about 40 feet from the ground, and stripped of every branch,\r\nso that it looked like a broken column; on its top sat a great vulture\r\nin the well-known attitude of its kind, as motionless as rock, and\r\napparently meditating on the incongruity of a noisy, vulgar bit of\r\nmachinery, with its train of cars, invading such a nook of Nature's\r\nsolitudes.\r\n\r\nAs we proceeded we came upon the succession of Placer gold diggings,\r\nknown as the hydraulic mines, which were then for the most part\r\nabandoned, and these brought to my remembrance many similar spots I had\r\nseen in Australia. The _débris_ of the mines had stopped up, or\r\ndiverted, or otherwise interfered with the Sacramento River, the Bear\r\nRiver, and other rivers, to the great detriment of agriculture,\r\nhorticulture, stock rearing, etc., whereupon the State Legislature of\r\nCalifornia passed an Act to prohibit all interference with the water,\r\nfor without water the miners could not wash their dirt, and so had to\r\nabandon the diggings. All around this part, ravine followed ravine, with\r\nbeautiful vistas between, affording a continuous luxury of scenic\r\ngratification. Presently we reached what is called by many the grandest\r\nscenery on the American Continent, known as Cape Horn; it is where the\r\ntrain winds round a mountain side, on a narrow ledge, and at such a\r\nheight, that to hold one's hand out of the window would be to hold it\r\nover a sheer precipice of 2,500 feet. The train runs along the ledge or\r\nnarrow roadway cut in the face of the mountain rock, and all around is\r\npresented a spectacle of the majesty of Nature, which only such a range\r\nof mountains as the Sierra Nevada could produce.\r\n\r\nAbout 14 miles from Truckee, we reach a station called \"Summit,\" which\r\nlies at an elevation of 7,017 feet, and is the highest point on the\r\nSierra Nevada Mountains reached by railroads, but the granite peaks rise\r\nup to an altitude of over 10,000 feet. Grizzly bears, and other wild\r\ncreatures, find their homes in the recesses of these fastnesses. On\r\nleaving these mountains we make a rapid descent, and in an hour feel\r\nthat we are in another country. At Colfax I bought fruit; at Arlington\r\nthe temperature was like summer. At Rockling Station I saw some very\r\nfine orange trees, full of splendid fruit. Now we have entered the\r\nfertile plains of North California, and run through cultivated lands,\r\ntill we reach Sacramento, the capital of the State. It is a great\r\nchange: from desert, alkaline plains, miles of snow sheds, snow-covered\r\nmountains, a semi-civilization, and a freezing atmosphere, we find\r\nourselves in a warm, genial climate, cultivated farms, vineyards,\r\ngardens, and orchards of nectarines, pears, apples, and the rest.\r\n\r\nArriving at Oakland, we crossed the Bay in the great ferry-ship, or\r\nfloating wharf, \"Piedmont.\" The weather was charming--the bay dotted\r\nabout with islands and surrounded by hills. The temperature was the more\r\nenjoyable from the fact that only a few hours before we were surrounded\r\nby deep snow.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at San Francisco (on Saturday, December 6th), I went\r\nstraight to the Palace Hotel, and my first effort was to get a bath, for\r\na continuous day and night run from New York of 3,367 miles, makes one\r\nwho is accustomed to the use of plenty of water to look for a good\r\nablution as the first refresher. The Palace Hotel claims to be the\r\n\"model hotel of the world.\" Its architect visited the leading hotels of\r\nEurope so as to produce a hotel superior to any. As to size, it occupies\r\na complete block--that is, it has a street traversing each side of it.\r\nIt rises to a height of 120 feet, and covers an area 350 feet by 275\r\nfeet--that is, 96,250 square feet, or nearly 2-3/4 acres, and, with\r\nsub-sidewalk extensions, exceeds three acres. The lower story is 27 feet\r\nhigh, the uppermost one 16 feet high. The foundation wall is 12 feet\r\nthick, and the principal materials are stone, iron, brick, and marble.\r\nEvery partition wall throughout is stone and brick. It is fire and\r\nearthquake proof, the walls being additionally tied by iron bands. It\r\nhas four artesian wells, yielding 28,000 gallons of water an hour, a\r\n630,000 gallon reservoir, and tanks holding 130,000 gallons more. The\r\nwater is served by three large steam fire pumps, which throw the water\r\nabove the roof. There are five patent safety-catch hydraulic elevators\r\n(or lifts). Immense precautions have been taken against fire. The\r\ndining-rooms are 150 feet by 55 feet, and 100 feet by 50 feet. The\r\npublic rooms are very numerous, and are of immense size. The rooms for\r\nguests are principally 20 feet by 20 feet; none are less than 16 feet by\r\n16 feet; all are well furnished. The corridors are like streets--space,\r\nelegance, solidity, and comfort are apparent everywhere; the whole being\r\nlighted by gas and electricity. Each bedroom has a bath-room, with hot\r\nand cold water services; w.c., coat-closet, and lavatory closet, with\r\nhot and cold water services to itself, and which can only be used by the\r\noccupant of the bed-room. The hotel, of course, has a barber's shop, and\r\nas I expected my client to call I was anxious to get through my toilet\r\nquickly; so I rang for one of the barber's assistants to come to my\r\nbed-room to cut my hair preparatory to the bath. This did not take long,\r\nand I asked the price, when, to my surprise, a dollar and a-half,\r\n_i.e.,_ 6s. 3d., was required. I thought it was barbarism indeed!\r\n\r\nI left San Francisco on Monday, December 8th, and during my short stay I\r\nsaw something of the town; but it was not the same place as I remembered\r\nit from my two visits to it in 1862. It is full of life and activity,\r\nhas many wealthy men, 50 of whom, it is said, are millionaires. It has a\r\nlarge number of grand buildings, fine shops, extensive markets,\r\nbeautiful private residences, and an immense development of electricity\r\nfor motion, light, sound, etc. The tram-cars run in constant succession\r\neverywhere; but the most remarkable cars are those worked by an endless\r\ncable. In the city are works with immense steam power, and from these\r\nworks endless cables revolve throughout the city, under the roads, in\r\nvarious directions. In the bed of the tramway is a groove, under which\r\nis the cable, revolving at a great speed. The driver of the car lets\r\ndown his grip, which tightly holds the cable, and, of course, the car\r\nstarts at full speed, and is carried along by the cable. When the driver\r\nwants to stop, he lets go his grip on the cable and applies his brake.\r\nSome of the hills in San Francisco are very steep, and the first\r\nsensation in riding on the outside front seat, while going full speed\r\ndown a sharp declivity, is certainly novel, with no apparent motive\r\npower, and no apparent means of stopping. The speed, of course, is\r\nalways the same, whether up or down hill, or on level ground. Telegraph\r\nHill is 394 feet high, Clay Street Hill 376 feet, and Russian Hill 360\r\nfeet. A San Francisco Sunday is painful to one accustomed to our English\r\nways; travelling in every form, and buying and selling are very\r\nprevalent. The Y.M.C.A. have a large building there, and get large\r\nmeetings. I attended one gathering, which I addressed shortly.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is described as having \"the mildest and most equable\r\nclimate known to any large city in the world.\" January is the coldest\r\nmonth, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 50°. September is\r\nthe hottest month, and the mean temperature then is stated to be 58°.\r\nThus only 8° difference between the coldest and warmest months, and the\r\naverage for the whole year is 54°.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has a population of about 300,000 (including some 40,000\r\nChinese), is the principal city of the State of California, and the\r\nprincipal commercial centre on the Pacific coast. I must not, however,\r\ndwell longer on this part of my journey. On Monday, December 8th, I left\r\nSan Francisco with one of my clients, Mr. C.H. Huffman, for Merced, by\r\nthe 4 p.m train. The sun was shining gloriously, producing a charming\r\neffect upon the placid waters of the Bay and its beautiful surrounding\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO TO NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\nThe train reached Merced at 10.23 on Monday night, December 8th, 1890,\r\nwhere I was met, and in a spacious family buggy, drawn by a pair of good\r\nhorses, I was very soon at the residence of my client, Mr. C.H. Huffman.\r\nThe continuous day and night travelling by rail, and the taking of\r\nvoluminous notes all along, had caused a constant excitement which told\r\nupon the nerves, and for two days I felt as though I needed absolute\r\nrest, but, remembering that I had already been long absent from my\r\noffice, I commenced my work at Merced the next morning. The town of\r\nMerced is the capital of the county of that name; it is not many years\r\nold, but it has a striking difference to many new small towns I have\r\nseen in the Colonies, in that it has several very good buildings and\r\nresidences. It has seven churches and chapels of various denominations,\r\nsome good shops, medical men, society, schools, gas, water, electricity,\r\nand a station on the main Great Southern Pacific Railway. It is\r\nundoubtedly a town which must rapidly increase in value, for this\r\nreason: My clients, Messrs. Crocker and Huffman, at a cost of some two\r\nmillion dollars, have tapped the Great Merced River 25 miles off, and\r\nbrought water down to the town and irrigated the country round. They\r\nhave formed a reservoir 640 acres in extent. Hitherto the rich lands\r\naround the town of Merced have not been irrigated, and consequently were\r\nnot suitable for growing the Fruits for which California is so famous;\r\nbut, now that a system of canals, formed by my clients, has irrigated\r\ntheir estate, extending over some 50,000 or 60,000 acres, the whole of\r\nthis great area is changed in value, and is available, and will\r\neventually be used, for the production of choice Fruits. Thus, Merced\r\nwill become a centre, like other parts of California, and, being so much\r\nnearer than those other parts to San Francisco, will benefit\r\nadditionally by that advantage alone. Merced is only 152 miles from San\r\nFrancisco, while Fresno is 207, Bakersfield 314, and Los Angeles, 483\r\nmiles. It is rumoured that another line of railway will also be formed\r\nin connection with the present main line, and Merced would then be an\r\nimportant railway junction. I drove out every day with Mr. Huffman, and\r\ninspected the country for some miles around the town, including the\r\nMerced River, 25 miles off. The land designated British Colony, is, at\r\nits commencement, only two miles from the Merced Railway Station, hotel,\r\nand shops. Mr. Huffman has a most comfortable residence, and has\r\nexcellent stables, well filled with first-class buggy horses, so that\r\ntravelling was always an easy matter. Being a lay preacher in England, I\r\ntook advantage of offers made me, and preached on the Sunday I was at\r\nMerced in two of the churches at the morning and evening services.\r\n\r\nI left Merced on Tuesday night, December 16th, by the 10.23 train,\r\nhaving stayed there eight days. I immediately \"turned in,\" and next\r\nmorning (December 17th) was up as usual at 6.30, and much enjoyed the\r\nsplendid scenery through which we were passing--in a mountainous\r\ncountry, grandly diversified with all the alternations of heights and\r\ndepths, lights and darks, rich and barren, including many evidences of\r\nengineering skill--as we coursed along, now looking high up, now looking\r\nlow down, and presently winding along the celebrated \"loop,\" described\r\nas the \"greatest engineering feat in the world,\" by which the train goes\r\nthrough mountain passes, creeping along the tops of eminences, then\r\nreturning, crosses under itself at a low level, then, ascending, crosses\r\nover itself at a higher level, so that in its meandering course you now\r\nlook down at your side on the line you have just traversed, and anon\r\nlook up at your side at the line you are about to traverse. We passed\r\nthrough the Mojava (pronounced Moharvie) desert, where the yucca palm is\r\nplentiful. A fellow passenger, and old settler, enlivened the time by\r\nsome relations of his experiences thus: He once shot a grizzly bear\r\nwhich weighed 1,500 lbs. Some are much larger than this. Everything of\r\nweight in America is generally reckoned by pounds, not cwts. or tons. On\r\nanother occasion he slew a Californian lion. He had killed a bullock,\r\nand the carcase was hanging in his house at the back, where was an\r\naperture like a small window without glass, and under this opening\r\noutside stood an empty case. The lion scenting the carcase, and hearing\r\nno sound from within, approached the house, and was endeavouring to\r\ncreep through the aperture when, in its efforts to do so, it kicked the\r\ncase away, and the poor animal was stuck fast, having its head and\r\nshoulders inside. My fellow traveller, on returning home, was surprised\r\nto find his visitor, and so despatched him with an axe, and has for\r\nyears used the skin, which is 9 feet 8 inches long. The temperature was\r\ncharming, although in the distance we could see the snow-capped\r\nmountains. We run through the antelope valley, gather some juniper\r\nplant, see a skunk, see natural oil wells at Saugus, pass the head of\r\nthe Santa Clara Valley, see the San Fernando mountains, go through the\r\ngreatest tunnel in America--the San Fernando tunnel, 6,967 feet long,\r\ngo by Burbank, where there is a land boom, and arrive at Los Angeles,\r\nwhere during the two hours of waiting I have a look at the town and a\r\npleasant chat with Mr. White Mortimer, the British Consul, whom I called\r\nupon. The next day (December 18th) we were on the desert of Arizona,\r\nwhere we saw Indian camps at places which were somewhat oases as to\r\nplant life. Speaking generally, nothing grows on a great part of this\r\ndesert but cactus, of which I am told there are some 200 varieties, from\r\nthe dwarf kind to trees 40 feet high. This plant has a strange if not a\r\nweird appearance. Here and there, like solitary sentinels, stands out a\r\ntall cactus, with perhaps two or three heads or branches, growing\r\nperpendicularly with itself. The mountains on either side look as if\r\nthey had their origin in volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the desert are covered with a dwarf kind of evergreen\r\nshrub. We see large numbers of prairie dogs, which are of a size between\r\na rat and a rabbit; they live in holes like rabbits. There are also\r\ngophers, skunks, prairie rats, rattlesnakes, and hawks, which feed on\r\nsnakes and rats. We pass tribes of Yuma Indians, Aztec Indians and Gila\r\n(pronounced Heela) Indians. On reaching a part where is some grass we\r\nsee some cattle, which are straying on the line; the engine whistle\r\nshrieks, the cattle run, and some coyote wolves are startled from their\r\nlairs and run, too; large numbers are here, and the preceding night\r\ntheir yells aroused some passengers from sleep. As we proceed, quail are\r\nseen, and wild cats something like a lynx. Arriving at Tucson\r\n(pronounced Tewsohn), I enquired for a gentleman to whom I had an\r\nintroduction, but learned that he was up at his gold mine. This Tucson\r\nis an ancient city, having been founded by the Jesuits in 1560 A.D. It\r\ndoes a large business in exporting gold dust, wool, and hides. I expect\r\nthat these mountains of Arizona contain much value in minerals. The\r\nIndians in this part of the country are the Apaches, and were described\r\nto me as the most treacherous of all the American Indians, that they are\r\ncowardly and will never fight in the open. A gentleman who entered the\r\ntrain at Tucson gave me many instances of this. In the evening we saw\r\n\"cow-boys\" round their fire camping out in the open, and also a camp of\r\nfreighters resting on their journey across the desert. The next morning\r\nearly (December 19th) we arrived at El Paso, a most interesting Mexican\r\ntown situate on the borders of Old Mexico, New Mexico and Texas, where I\r\nbought the skin of a Mexican tiger, and other things.\r\n\r\nIn travelling for some days in a train continuously one feels the need\r\nof exercise, and this I obtained by getting in and out of many of the\r\nrailway stations and walking up and down. Between San Francisco and New\r\nOrleans there are 322 stations, and I should suppose the number of\r\nstations on both the Northern and Southern routes I traversed would\r\nprobably amount to nearly 700.\r\n\r\nWe are now commencing to cross the great plains of Texas. At first the\r\nplains are desert, with mountains skirting our view; the scenery is less\r\ninteresting than the Arizona desert, because there are no cacti. This\r\ndesert has probably been under salt water at some time. The rocky hills\r\nappear to have a volcanic origin. As we go on, we reach a poor kind of\r\npasture, growing out of a scrubby kind of shrub, with some occasional\r\ncacti, many hills and mountains like barren rocks, with not a bird or an\r\nanimal to be seen. The weather has been warm since leaving Merced, but\r\nnow, so far south as we are, it is hot on this December day. I had read\r\nin the short telegrams given by American papers, that the winter was\r\nvery severe in England, and I pictured often to myself, friends and\r\nclients in England muffled up amidst frost and snow, whilst I was\r\nrevelling in glorious sunshine, so warm that no greatcoat could be worn.\r\nHad I returned by the route I went (the Northern Prairies), I might have\r\nbeen delayed by snow drifts, but by this, the Southern route, there was\r\nno snow, but a continuous, cheerful, delightful sunshine, not too hot\r\nanywhere, but simply delightful. I should certainly recommend anyone\r\ngoing from England to California in the winter season, to go by the\r\nSouthern route. Amongst the objects of interest, we notice in the\r\ndistance a small herd of 14 wild antelope trotting along; cattle, coyote\r\nwolves, and, at many places, the well-picked bones of animals which had\r\ndropped dead, or, when weak, had been killed or eaten by carnivora or\r\nreptiles. We saw large numbers of prairie dogs; they sit outside their\r\nholes like a squirrel, on their haunches, with their fore paws up; they\r\nare very quick, and most difficult even to shoot. More antelopes and\r\ncoyotes. At a station called Alpine were several cowboys, all armed with\r\nrevolvers and cartridge belts, and some with dagger knives too; their\r\nmustangs were hitched up close by. These cowboys are some old and some\r\nyoung men, some wild and some cultivated, some never educated, some have\r\ngone through Harvard, or Oxford, or Cambridge, some the sons of English\r\ncounty gentlemen and noblemen--but all cowboys, _i.e.,_ men who live on\r\nranches where large herds of cattle or horses are bred, and whose duty\r\nit is to ride over the wild rough country to know where the herds of\r\ncattle and horses are feeding, so that if they need to be ridden up for\r\ncutting or branding, or selling, they may be found. I was told that this\r\nwas one of the \"hardest\" places for a cowboy, _i.e.,_ one of the\r\nwickedest, meaning that when they visit it, it is for a \"spree,\" and\r\nthey get drunk, and fights and murders follow. I was pointed to a little\r\ncemetery on a hill, enclosed by a white fence, and was told that it\r\ncontained 150 bodies, and that only 50 had died a natural death; the\r\nothers had been shot or otherwise murdered in drunken frays and other\r\nways. Many strange little histories were told me about these men, but\r\nwhich I have no time to record here. In some parts of the country where\r\nwater was very scarce, there seemed to be no vegetation, and the cattle\r\nseemed to wander solitarily along, a mere heap of hide and bone. At\r\nmany stations I had quite a considerable interval for running about,\r\nsuch as when a wheel caught fire, which happened two or three times, or\r\nsome freight had to be taken in, or taken out, etc. When the train again\r\nstarts, the conductors shout \"All aboard,\" and there is a general rush.\r\n\r\nThe next day (December 20th) was again a brilliant day of sunshine; we\r\nsee many buzzards, and breakfast at San Antonio. The railway stations\r\nalong this country have two roofs, one being two or three feet above the\r\nother, so that air between should keep the building cool. At breakfast,\r\nI read the San Antonio _Daily Express_, which informed me \"severe storms\r\nprevailed everywhere in Great Britain,\" and my thoughts were naturally\r\nmuch occupied with the Old Country. The day was sultry, but sunshine is\r\nalways a great treat to me, and it was never too hot.\r\n\r\nNow we are running into civilization again, and I catch sight of a man\r\nploughing; he has a pair of mules, and is holding the reins in his\r\nteeth. As we proceed, it is a continuous succession of cotton fields,\r\ncotton fields, cotton fields. We see many bales; these weigh from 475 to\r\n600 lbs. each. At a station called Sequin, I obtained lots of cotton\r\nseeds, and gathered some cotton in the fields as we went along. The\r\nscavengers of this country are Turkey buzzards, which are protected by\r\nlaw because of their usefulness.\r\n\r\nI could not refrain from writing several times in my note-book,\r\n\"glorious sunshine.\" Hitherto we have had mountains continuously in\r\nsight, but now they are out of vision. This being Saturday we see\r\nmarkets at the towns we go through; at Habwood and Flatonia especially\r\nwas this noticeable. The population seemed almost altogether negro. I\r\nobserved a negro and his wife, well dressed, riding on horseback in the\r\nold English pillion style; another negro and his wife, and about twelve\r\nchildren, in a capacious kind of wagon-buggy, and many negroes and\r\nnegresses, the latter dressed in white and gay colours, standing at\r\ntheir pretty verandahed cottages.\r\n\r\nWe now pass a spot where a train was stopped and the passengers robbed\r\nsome time ago, by Jesse and Frank Jeames and the Ford Brothers. The\r\n_modus operandi_ is for all the men to be secreted but one, who stands\r\non the line holding up a red flag which indicates danger; the engineer\r\nthen stops and the men spring aboard; some hold revolvers to the heads\r\nof the engineers, and others go through the train and rob the\r\npassengers. The robbers shout out \"hands up,\" and one man points his\r\nweapon at the passenger's head, whilst another rifles his pockets. If a\r\npassenger fails to hold up his hands he is shot down. A passenger on the\r\nNorthern Prairies told me of a fellow passenger, who under such\r\ncircumstances having a revolver, aimed at a robber and pulled the\r\ntrigger, but it missed fire, and he was instantly shot down. But these\r\nattacks are now more rare, and the officials are more prepared for them.\r\nSometimes the robbers get on board the train as passengers, and act\r\nsuddenly in concert. All along the country now we pass the cabins of the\r\nslaves, familiarised to us by \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" These cabins are\r\npleasant little houses with verandahs, and I reflected how favourably\r\nthey compared with the \"homes\" of many of the London poor, and how happy\r\nthe slaves might have been but for the knowledge that at any time they\r\nwere liable to be sold like a mule or a bullock. Now we pass sugar,\r\ncotton and rice plantations, and go through such cultivations all\r\nthrough Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, North and South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, and Virginia. I gathered sugar and cotton going along at\r\nplaces, saw a racoon in a stream fishing for crawfish, and go through a\r\ncountry, in which are plenty of alligators.\r\n\r\nOn the early morning of Sunday (December 21st), we go through swamps,\r\nsuch as we used to read of as the hiding-places of runaway slaves. All\r\nthrough these Southern States we saw everywhere sugar and cotton, sugar\r\nand cotton, sugar and cotton; these, with rice, are the principal\r\nproducts; sugar mills, cotton yards, etc., etc. We soon reach Algiers,\r\nand cross the grand Mississippi River, then land at New Orleans. The\r\nactual city of New Orleans covers an area of about 41 square miles, but\r\nthe statutory limits of the city embrace nearly 150 square miles. It is\r\nsituate on both banks of the Mississippi River, and from 1,000 to 1,500\r\nsteamers and other vessels, from all parts of the world, may frequently\r\nbe seen lying there. New Orleans is the chief market in the world for\r\ncotton. The site of the city was surveyed in 1717 by De la Tour, and it\r\nwas settled in 1718, but abandoned in consequence of overflows, storms,\r\nand sickness; it was resettled in 1723, held by the French till 1729,\r\nthen by the Spaniards till 1801, by the French again till 1803, and\r\nthen, with the Province of Louisiana, was ceded to the United States.\r\nThe present population is about 250,000. There are 33 cemeteries, and\r\nthey are remarkable, inasmuch as the bodies are buried above ground, in\r\nvaults like tiers of ovens; the ground is too wet for burial. I attended\r\nTrinity Church in the morning, had some black bear for dinner at my\r\nhotel, the \"Hotel St. Charles,\" and then attended the Y.M.C.A., where I\r\ngave the address in the afternoon, which was followed by a very solemn\r\nafter meeting. I went to bed very early, and was up very early the next\r\nmorning (Monday, December 22nd). I had to draw the mosquito curtains in\r\nthe night, but not till after some of these insects had left their mark.\r\nThe principal ground floor of the hotel was on the first floor level,\r\nand the actual ground floor was of secondary importance; the front part\r\nwas occupied by stone steps and a colonnade, and the rear was a liquor\r\nbar and a large hall. This hall used to be one of the principal auction\r\nrooms of the city, where slaves were sold by auction; and as I entered\r\nthe now rather desolate-looking place, which is partly circular in\r\nshape and constructed with many pillar supports, I pictured to myself\r\nthe emotional agonies, the tempests of passion, the lust of greed, the\r\ncalm, subdued, resistless attitude of despair which at times found\r\nexpression, as domestic circles were for ever broken, tenderest\r\nsympathies for ever sundered, closest friendships for ever\r\nseparated--yea, even the most sacred relationships of life ruthlessly\r\nshattered, by the sale of mothers or fathers, brothers or sisters, wives\r\nor husbands, sweethearts or friends. Of this I will give just two\r\nillustrations: Our porter on the train crossing the Northern Prairies\r\nwas a coloured man named Farrell; he told me that his mother had seven\r\nboys, and that they were all sold away from her, and that it had been\r\nhis life-work to try to find his brothers. He had shipped to Australia\r\nas a seaman, had worked in hotels, and on wharves and rivers, and now\r\nwas working on the railway cars endeavouring to find his brothers; he\r\nhad advertised for them in the newspapers, but he had never heard of one\r\nof them. When this family was broken up, Farrell and his brothers were\r\nonly boys; for it will be remembered that the date of the official\r\nannouncement of the total abolition of slavery in the United States was\r\nmade on the 18th December, 1862, when upwards of 4,000,000 slaves were\r\nlegally declared free men. Another coloured man engaged at this hotel,\r\nwho was born a slave, remembered walking with his father, who was also a\r\nslave, and his father's anxiety to get home before nine o'clock at\r\nnight, as no coloured man was allowed to be in the streets after that\r\nhour unless he possessed a sufficient authority from his owner. This man\r\ntold me that at an auction of slaves at this hotel (auctions of slaves\r\nwere held in New Orleans at different places three times a week) a very\r\nfine intelligent young man was sold by auction for 2,100 dollars to a\r\nlawyer who was known to be a cruel man. My informant told me that his\r\nname was--well, it sounded like Rumo, possibly Roumeaux, as most of the\r\nwealthy settlers were of French origin, that he lived in St. James'\r\nWard, and that when he bought slaves and sent them down to his\r\nplantations, they each received twenty-five lashes as they entered his\r\ngates, as an example, of what they would receive if they did not please\r\nhim. Well, when the hammer fell and this slave knew that he belonged to\r\nan owner whose cruelty was common talk, he exclaimed, \"You have lost\r\nyour money.\" This slave was sent down with others to the steamer on the\r\nMississippi (which is only some ten minutes' walk from the hotel), for\r\nshipment to this owner's plantations. The poor fellow was not even\r\nallowed to say good-bye to his people, but was sent on board. When he\r\narrived there, he repeated to the man in charge of the slaves, \"Mr. Rumo\r\nwill lose his money,\" and shortly after he took advantage of a\r\nfavourable moment, and, folding his arms, he threw himself backward into\r\nthe river, and was drowned.\r\n\r\nA few minutes' walk from my hotel is the Henry Clay monument, where the\r\nmob was addressed last month by Mr. Parkerson, who incited them to\r\nproceed to the prison and force an entrance, and then to take the lives\r\nof a number of Italian murderers by lynch law. On this monument some\r\nmemorable words are inscribed which Mr. Clay uttered, and which T\r\ncopied. They are as follows:--\"If I could be instrumental in eradicating\r\nthis deep stain, slavery, from the character of our country, I would not\r\nexchange the proud satisfaction which I should enjoy for the honour of\r\nall the triumphs ever decreed to the most successful conqueror.\" That\r\ndeep stain was removed in 1862, and slaves were raised from the\r\ncondition of cattle to that of men, who could thenceforward rejoice in\r\nthe freedom of being masters of their own bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ORLEANS TO LONDON.\r\n\r\nOn leaving New Orleans we run through swamps, and presently skirt the\r\nGulf of Mexico and travel on. The next day (December 23rd), we feel it\r\nperceptibly colder, for we are going north. The country is cultivated in\r\nsugar, cotton, rice, grass, etc. We breakfast at Atlanta, and after\r\nleaving that place, the scenery puts me more in mind of England. In\r\ngoing through Georgia, I was told that the same black families which now\r\noccupy many of the small wooden houses, or \"cabins,\" which I see, are\r\nthe same families who occupied them before the abolition of slavery.\r\nAlthough many slaves suffered cruelties through enforced separations and\r\nhard treatment, yet very many had most comfortable homes, considerate\r\nmasters, and light work. I sat much during this day on the platform at\r\nthe end of the end car, observing the country. At one station some\r\nlittle black urchins came to gaze, and I said to one boy, apparently\r\nseven years old, \"What is your name?\" He said, \"Willie Matthews.\" I\r\nsaid, \"How old are you? \" He said, \"I ain't old enough to know how old I\r\nare.\" And his genuine simplicity delighted me.\r\n\r\nWe are now passing through cultivated lands, farms, and estates, and\r\nthese continue right on to New York. At Greers was a very large\r\ncollection of cotton. At Spartanville are large cotton mills, such as\r\none sees in Lancashire. The next day (December 24th), we notice ice on\r\nthe ponds. We cross the Potomac River, and near Washington, sight the\r\nCapitol--or, as we should say in England, the Houses of Parliament.\r\nWashington City is the political capital of the United States. Its size\r\nis about 4-1/2 miles by 2-1/2 miles. The Capitol is described by the\r\nAmericans as the most magnificent public edifice in the world. It is 352\r\nfeet long and 121 feet deep, with two wings each 238 by 140 feet. Its\r\nentire length is 751 feet 4 inches, and it covers an area of more than\r\n3-1/2 acres. It is of costly construction, and stands in grounds of\r\nabout 50 acres.\r\n\r\nWe proceed, and stop at Baltimore, cross the Bush and Gunpowder Rivers,\r\nagain come near the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers, various smaller\r\nrivers, and run on until we reach New York. On arrival, I immediately\r\nwent to the Cunard office and secured my berth in the \"Servia.\" The next\r\nmorning (Christmas Day), it was very cold, and snowing. I had a fire lit\r\nin my bed-room, and there wrote the article which appeared in the\r\nJanuary _Land Roll_. In the afternoon I walked in the Central Park, but\r\nit was so bitterly cold, I was satisfied with less than two hours of\r\nexercise, and returned to the hotel to dinner, and finished up the day\r\nwriting in my bed-room till midnight. The Central Park, in genial\r\nweather, would be an attractive resort. I observed large natural rocks,\r\nlawns, wide promenades, seats, lakes, menageries, swings, and various\r\nsuch like attractions for juveniles, overground and underground roads--a\r\nkind of \"Rotten Row,\" &c., but being so cold scarcely a person was to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nOn December 26th, New York was deep in snow. I visited a few shops for\r\nsome necessaries, and went on board the \"Servia\" during the afternoon,\r\nthinking that I might have difficulty in getting a cabman to drive to\r\nthe docks after dark if the snow drifted deeply. New York City is the\r\nmetropolis of the United States. In 1880 its population was 1,206,590.\r\nIts site was discovered in 1524. It was in 1609 that Hudson, an\r\nEnglishman, ascended the river which was named after him. In 1614 some\r\nDutchmen settled there. In 1648 its population was 1,000, and in 1700 it\r\nhad increased to 6,000. In 1684 it was captured by the Duke of York, and\r\nwas henceforth called \"New York.\" In 1711 a slave market was established\r\nin Wall Street.\r\n\r\nOn December 27th, about 5 o'clock in the morning, we began to clear out\r\nof the dock, and in a few hours were again on the broad Atlantic. The\r\nnext day (Sunday, December 28th), we had service on board, conducted by\r\nthe doctor in the saloon: all on board not actually on duty may attend.\r\nWe left New York in a blizzard, and our decks were coated with frost and\r\nsnow, but after two days this was all cleared away, and we had a\r\nsplendid run in genial weather, so that one day I could comfortably walk\r\non deck without a greatcoat.\r\n\r\nOur run was--from Sandy Hook Lighthouse (45 miles) to noon of December\r\n28th, 373 miles; noon of December 29th, 379 miles; December 30th, 375\r\nmiles; December 31st, 878 miles; January 1st, 1891, 372 miles; January\r\n2nd, 362 miles; January 3rd, 371 miles; thence, to Queenstown, 169\r\nmiles; and from Queenstown to Liverpool, 240 miles; making a total of\r\n3,064 miles. The passage in the \"Etruria,\" going out, was 3,062 miles.\r\nThe \"Servia\" is a fine ship, but much older than the \"Etruria,\" and her\r\nengines, consequently, are not capable of the speed of a newer vessel.\r\nHer cargo capacity is 6,500 tons, with 1,800 tons of coal and 1,000 tons\r\nof water ballast. Her horse-power is equal to 10,500. The saloon is 74\r\nby 49 feet, and is capable of seating 350 persons. The \"Servia\" has\r\ncabin accommodation for 500 saloon and 600 steerage passengers, besides\r\na crew of 200 officers and men. When there are more than 350 saloon\r\npassengers, each meal has to be served in two relays.\r\n\r\nAn interesting incident occurred during the passage: I discovered that\r\nour captain (now commanding the \"Aurania\") was a shipmate of mine in\r\n1855, when I was a midshipman. I reached my office in Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields at 8 o'clock on the morning of January 5th, having been absent\r\njust about six weeks. The distances were as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Liverpool to New York                3,062 miles.\r\n    New York to Chicago                    913 \"\r\n    Chicago to Council Bluffs              488 \"\r\n    Council Bluffs to San Francisco      1,867 \"\r\n    San Francisco to Merced                152 \"\r\n    Merced to New Orleans                2,344 \"\r\n    New Orleans to Washington            1,144 \"\r\n    Washington to New York                 228 \"\r\n    New York to Liverpool                3,064 \"\r\n    London to Liverpool                    201 \"\r\n    Liverpool to London                    201 \"\r\n    Journeys in buggies, tram-cars, &c.    110 \"\r\n                                        --------\r\n                                        13,774 \"\r\n\r\nI must conclude with some general remarks:--\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ recently published a series of ten articles on the \"Negro\r\nQuestion in the United States,\" and from them it appears that the\r\nposition of that country is very serious in this relation. These\r\narticles commenced after I had started on my journey, so that I only saw\r\none or two of the concluding ones and the _Times_ leader upon the whole,\r\nbut I was not surprised to see them, because in passing through the\r\nStates which are principally peopled by negroes, I heard something\r\nabout the matter from a thoughtful man, who regarded the subject with\r\ngreat gravity. The _Times_ has shown that the attitude of one race to\r\nthe other is that of \"antagonism, discontent, and perpetual danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe negroes have the same constitutional privileges as the whites, and\r\ntheir overpowering numbers in certain places give the power into their\r\nhands, which, regarded in relation to racial hatred, renders them to be\r\nan object of danger to the country. It is proposed to emigrate the\r\nnegroes to some part of Africa. It would be more consistent for certain\r\nAmericans to interest themselves in solving this problem of their own\r\nrather than encouraging Irish agitators, and so assisting to prevent\r\nEngland solving her dark problem across St. George's Channel.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of coloured people to white in the three states of\r\nGeorgia, Louisiana, and Alabama, is about equal, that is, there are as\r\nmany coloured people as white. The population of coloured people\r\nthroughout the whole of the United States is about 7,000,000 of coloured\r\npeople to 59,000,000 of white people, but it is a sad fact, as stated in\r\nthe _Times_ of March 7th last, that a Government return, dated June\r\n1st, 1890, showed that there were 45,233 convicts in the prisons of the\r\nUnited States, and that of this number no less than 14,687, or one-third\r\nwere coloured people, and that out of these coloured people only 237\r\nwere Chinese, 3 Japanese, and 180 Indians, so that 14,267 were negroes.\r\nAs the whites, counting all the States, are eight times as numerous as\r\nthe coloured people, and yet the coloured convicts are one-third of the\r\nwhole, it speaks badly for the morals of the negro race in America.\r\n\r\nI was much struck with the immense development of electricity. Steamers,\r\nrailway carriages, tramcars, hotels, shops, towns, villages, and railway\r\nstations, even those in remote places, with scarcely a building near to\r\nthem, were all well lighted by electricity.\r\n\r\nRailways run on scaffoldings down the centre of the streets, and horses\r\nwith their vehicles run underneath them. The railway trains are well\r\nheated throughout by hot water pipes (every class), and reflect a grave\r\nreproach on our country, where, in the severest weather, it is difficult\r\nto get a foot warmer, except by certain main line trains, and, even\r\nthen, one is expected to \"tip\" the attendant. Poor persons travelling in\r\nthin garments and poorly fed, in severe weather, scarcely ever dare to\r\nask for a foot warmer unless they are prepared to fee someone, and,\r\nwhether rich or poor, no one can get a foot warmer at any of our country\r\nstations. When we consider that railways originated in this country, and\r\nthat some of the parts of America I passed through were, some 50, some\r\n40, and some even 30 years ago, only known to the trapper and the\r\nIndian, it shows the increase of enterprise exhibited by our cousins\r\nover the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nTramcars are worked by electricity, by steam, by horses and mules, and\r\nby revolving endless cables. Telephones are everywhere. The railway\r\njourneys in America often occupying several days, the tickets are a kind\r\nof succession of coupons, parts of which have to be given up at various\r\nstages. Caution is exercised in selling railway tickets for long\r\njourneys--thus, you are required to sign the ticket, and observations\r\nare made of you, such as your height, probable age, colour of your eyes,\r\nhair, etc. Some of the lines of railway are not fenced in, not even in\r\ntowns, so that the train runs through a town as openly as does an\r\nomnibus. I may convey some idea of some of the large American systems\r\nof agriculture, by referring to the estate of one of my clients, Mr.\r\nC.H. Huffman, of Merced, California. This gentleman has fields ranging\r\nfrom 1,000 to 15,000 acres each. He can plough 400 to 500 acres a day.\r\nBy his traction engine he can strike 12 furrows at a time. He can put 70\r\nteams (of eight mules or horses each) to work at one time. Each\r\nharvester will cut, thrash, and sack an average of 50 acres a day. The\r\nfront part of the machine faces the standing wheat in the field, in the\r\ncentre of the machine it is thrashed and winnowed, and at the rear it is\r\nthrown out in sacks ready for market. Mr. Huffman can sit in his study\r\nat home, and by his telephone talk to his clerks at Merced (he is the\r\nbanker there), as well as to the foremen at his various ranches for 25\r\nmiles round the country. I particularly noticed one of his fields of\r\nwheat, comprising 2,000 acres, as level and clean as a well-kept lady's\r\nflower garden in England.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have a greater variety of foods served at their meals than\r\nwe do, but I never got the flavour of meat cut from a joint to equal\r\nthat which, when really well roasted and served, we get in England. As\r\nto bread, I never tasted bread worth the name, from the time I left\r\nLondon to the time I returned to it. Alike on the Cunard steamers, cars,\r\nhotels, etc., you can get no wholemeal bread. French and Vienna breads,\r\nand other very white abortions of that kind are obtainable in abundance,\r\nand even a kind of brown bread, and \"Graham's\" bread, but good honest\r\nwholemeal bread, containing all the properties of the full kernel of the\r\nwheat, it is impossible to get, and this to me was a very great\r\ndeprivation, as my _principal_ article of food is _real_ wholemeal\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nThe system of the custody of letters at the large American hotels\r\nappeared to me rather unsafe. A visitor asks for letters, whereupon\r\nthere are handed to him all the letters in the pigeon-hole marked with\r\nthe initial of which the visitor's name commences. The visitor then\r\nproceeds to look through them, and takes what he chooses, and hands the\r\nrest back. The official is too busy, or it is not customary for him, to\r\nlook through them for the visitor, or even to watch the visitor in his\r\nprocess of selection. I noticed one gentleman with a packet of letters,\r\nI should think considerably over a hundred, every now and then slip one\r\ninto his breast pocket and give a furtive glance, which did not inspire\r\nconfidence, but probably this is a well accustomed habit of the people,\r\nand the letters, perhaps, are as safe as the newspapers I frequently saw\r\ndeposited on the tops of the street letter boxes (outside the boxes),\r\nbecause they were too large to be put inside; of course anyone could\r\nhave taken them, but the custom not to touch them is probably honourably\r\nrecognized. The street letter boxes are quite small square boxes, not\r\nlarge pillar boxes as are ours in this country.\r\n\r\nI should like to have remarked more generally on America, but both time\r\nand space fail me. Of course, as most people know, the (to us)\r\ndisgusting practice of spitting is common in America; spittoons are\r\nuniversally provided in public and private places. At Merced Court House\r\nis this notice: \"Gentlemen will not, and others should not spit upon the\r\nfloors.\" Huge spittoons are provided there.\r\n\r\nThe awful guttural which precedes the constant expectoration of\r\nAmericans is most trying. It excites in persons near them and who are\r\nunaccustomed to it, a sensation of necessity to vomit, as it conveys a\r\nfear that your neighbour is about to vomit over you. It is not the\r\nexcusable expectoration arising from an accumalation in the air\r\npassages, but a continuous fusilade of saliva. It is a disgusting\r\npractice, and I believe will die out in America as its citizens travel\r\nmore in the old countries and become used to manners more refined than\r\nsuch a one as this. I observed that my clients in California, who have\r\ntravelled in Europe, and other travelled Americans, are not guilty of\r\nthis odious practice.\r\n\r\nI would say to Englishmen travelling in America, don't condescend to the\r\n\"guessing\" and other loose styles of expression, and don't affect the\r\nnasal twang. Americans, with all their boast of one man being as good as\r\nanother, are greatly pleased to entertain or travel with Englishmen\r\nhaving a title, and they pay a marked respect to Britishers who speak in\r\na classical style, and who, while being devoid of foppishness, bounce,\r\nor vulgarity, conduct themselves with a genial dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=California.=\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now say something about California, and then proceed to describe\r\nthe lands for sale, and the prospects of those who will settle upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCalifornia lies on the genial coast of the Pacific Ocean, midway between\r\nthe too cold regions of the North and the too hot regions of the South.\r\nTo be exact, the mean temperature in San Francisco in the month of\r\nJanuary, averages about 49°. It has varied from 53° to 39°. The record\r\nof 32 years shows that between sunrise and sunset it has not been so low\r\nas 32° on more than 10 days. Snow is sometimes seen to fall, but it\r\nmelts immediately.\r\n\r\nCalifornia has a bright, genial climate, and is described as\r\n\"pre-eminently a sunny land.\" The early spring, commencing about the\r\nmiddle of February and lasting about six weeks, is a very pleasant part\r\nof the year, but April is described as the \"cheeriest.\" December and\r\nJanuary are the least pleasant, because it is the rainy and winter\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThunderstorms are rare, and no hurricane has ever been known there. The\r\nrainfall of California is about twenty inches, and the rainy days number\r\nabout sixty in the year, or about half the number of rainy days\r\nexperienced in the Atlantic States or Central Europe.\r\n\r\nAmongst the fruits grown in abundance are the orange, grape, peach,\r\napricot, plum, cherry, apple, nectarine, fig, lemon, lime, olive, date,\r\nand all the berries of value.\r\n\r\nBesides the immense growth of choice and luscious Fruits, for which\r\nCalifornia is famous all over the globe, it claims to have the largest\r\nmilk, butter, and cheese dairies in the world. It is also renowned for\r\nits mineral riches, its immense mercantile business, its manufacturing\r\nindustries, its production of wool, its gigantic timber, its wealth of\r\nbeauty in flowers, its fast horses, its grand scenery, embracing lofty\r\nmountains, deep valleys, expansive fertile plains, and all the\r\nvariations of a beautiful country, with many rivers, and a magnificent\r\nsea coast, whilst the \"coast range\" and the slopes of the \"Sierra\" offer\r\nto the sportsman such game in abundance as grizzly and cinnamon bears\r\nand Californian lions. There are also deer, hare, rabbit, quail, large\r\nflocks of wild ducks and geese, and the rivers afford such fish as\r\nsalmon and trout, and the deep sea splendid fishing.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco has been called \"a city of 100 hills.\" It has a population\r\nof nearly 300,000 inhabitants, amongst whom are no less than 50\r\n_millionaires_. Its harbour is known all over the globe as the \"Golden\r\nGate,\" and it has answered well to its name, for an entrance to its vast\r\nresources has made the fortune of multitudes of people, and many going\r\nthere now are laying the foundations for future wealth.\r\n\r\nThe lands of California have the two essentials for successful\r\nculture--a rich soil and genial climate, with plenty of sun, yet never\r\ntoo hot and never too cold for out-door work, and most of its domestic\r\nanimals are never housed, and require no food but wild herbage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT CULTURE IN CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nOur lands at Merced, in California, offer to gentlemen wishing to make a\r\nfirst or a fresh start in life a really good opportunity. It is\r\ndifficult to conceive how men with energy, enterprise, and a little\r\ncapital, can be content to sit in an office in foggy, blocked-up\r\nLondon, \"quill driving\" from year's end to year's end, when a prospect\r\nis afforded them, such as we now offer, of establishing a pleasant home\r\nin a luxurious land, with a sunny, genial climate, and within about a\r\nfortnight's travel of England, and where they would have the liberty of\r\nbeing their own masters, and lay the foundation of a future competency.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENCY.\r\n\r\nAs the currency in California is dollars, not pounds, we must ask our\r\nreaders to accustom themselves to dollars. A dollar is 100 cents, and,\r\nroughly speaking, a cent is equivalent to a halfpenny, so that a dollar\r\nwould be worth, of our money, four shillings and twopence. Its value,\r\nhowever, varies a few cents according to the place where it is\r\nexchanged. Bank of England notes or pounds are never worth less than\r\nfour shillings and twopence, _i.e.,_ 480 cents or halfpennies, which, of\r\ncourse, is four dollars and 80 cents, there being 100 cents in a dollar.\r\nThe decimal currency is extremely simple when once understood. Never\r\nless than 4.80 is given for an English pound, but sometimes 4.82 and\r\n4.85 is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCED.\r\n\r\nThe lands I have for sale are situate in the County of Merced, in\r\nCalifornia, about 150 miles by rail from the City of San Francisco, They\r\nare designated \"British Colony,\" and at the nearest point are just one\r\nmile from the boundary of the town of Merced, and two miles from the\r\nrailway station, hotel, shops, etc. Merced town is lighted by gas and\r\nelectricity, has water laid on, telephones, telegraphs, Court House,\r\nEpiscopal Church, Presbyterian Church, Cumberland Presbyterian Church,\r\nMethodist Church, South Methodist Church, Baptist Church, and Catholic\r\nChurch, two schools, shops of various kinds; two railroads, the main one\r\nrunning up to San Francisco, and down to Los Angeles and on to New\r\nOrleans, etc., and the other, a branch line to Stockton, Sacramento,\r\netc. Merced is 175 feet above the level of the sea; it is a pleasant\r\nlittle town, affords some congenial society, and I firmly believe will,\r\nbefore many years have passed, become an important centre, because my\r\nclients have brought water from the Merced River more than twenty miles\r\noff, by a system of canals, and have formed a reservoir of 640 acres in\r\nextent, with an average depth of 30 feet, and thus have given facilities\r\nfor irrigating the country round the town. It is certain to become a\r\ngreat Fruit-growing district, as its soil is so fully adapted for the\r\npurpose. It is much nearer to San Francisco than Los Angeles, and is\r\nnearer also than Fresno and other districts which have already made\r\nthemselves a name for Fruit culture.\r\n\r\nThe country around Merced has a natural fall, and is drained by many\r\ncreeks, which are dry in summer, but contain more or less water in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANDS FOR SALE.\r\n\r\nMerced is situated in the celebrated San Joaquin Valley (pronounced San\r\nWharkeen), which is an immense level of fertile land, the soil generally\r\nbeing of a rich sandy loam, but in some districts, such as that I am now\r\noffering for sale, of a deep rich black loam of a highly productive\r\nnature, in fact, it is the decomposed vegetation and alluvial deposits\r\nof past ages, than which nothing could be more fertile. We have good\r\nevidence that the land is especially suited for the production of\r\nprunes, apricots, pears, peaches, olives, plums, small Fruit, such as\r\nstrawberries, blackberries, sweet and common potatoes, garden stuff, and\r\nalfalfa. Alfalfa (or lucerne) is a great crop in America in places where\r\nthere are no old meadow lands for the cows. The land is, of course,\r\nsuited for all cereal crops, too. All the Fruits named can be dried in\r\nthe sun without artificial heat.\r\n\r\nThe lands are about 160 to 165 feet above the level of the sea, and, in\r\ncommon with all the country round, they command a view on the one side\r\nof the grand snow-capped Sierra Nevada Mountains, and on the other of\r\nthe mountains known as the Coast Range. Immense flocks of wild geese and\r\nducks (principally geese), are often on the land. There are also\r\n\"rabbits\" on the land (so called), but they more resemble hares in their\r\nsize and habits and run.\r\n\r\nThere are some excellent Fruit orchards and gardens at Merced. In the\r\ngrounds around the Court House are some very fine orange trees, full of\r\nfruit, and also in the gardens of private residents. One gentleman\r\nkindly sent a bough of oranges, and other gentlemen sent other Fruits,\r\nwhich may be seen at our offices. At the Buhach Colony, near the town\r\nof Merced, are extensive orchards of Californian Fruits. Mr. Atwater's\r\ngardens and orchard, a few miles from the town, are worth inspection. He\r\nhas two magnificent olive trees, nine or ten years' old, which bear\r\nheavy crops, and which are used for the production of olive oil; his\r\nvineyard and orange orchard, his lemon and persimmon trees, all look\r\nvery prosperous. He would gladly show any settler how he has cultivated\r\nthem. He has a corn and stock farm, and has only gradually cultivated\r\nthese Fruits, which occupy some eleven acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE OF THE LAND.\r\n\r\nThe prices of the land for sale are 75, and 100, and 150 dollars per\r\nacre, according to position. Two-thirds of the purchase-money may remain\r\non mortgage as long as the interest is paid at 8 per cent, per annum,\r\nwhich is the lowest interest payable in California. The mortgagor is\r\nliable to the Government for the taxes, which amount to 1-1/2 to 2 per\r\ncent, per annum, so that he would really only receive 6 to 6-1/2 per\r\ncent, interest. All mortgages are publicly recorded, and so the\r\nproperty is vested in the mortgagor till he is paid off, and when that\r\nis done it also is publicly recorded. These taxes embrace all known to\r\nus in England as rates and taxes, except a road tax of 2 dollars a head\r\nper annum, chargeable to every male over twenty-one years of age. This\r\ntax may be paid for in labour on the road if desired. A free conveyance\r\nwill be given, but the cost of recording the transaction in the county\r\noffice (there is no stamp duty), about 1-1/2 dollars, must be paid by\r\nthe purchaser. The recording of a mortgage would probably be 3-1/4\r\ndollars because it is longer. The record is a public acknowledgment of\r\nthe title of the owner to the land made in the county books.\r\n\r\nForeigners can hold freehold property in California, but they have no\r\nright to vote--indeed, they would have no right to vote until they had\r\nresided five years in the country, and had become naturalized; then a\r\nresident has before him the possibility of becoming Governor of the\r\nState to which he belongs, or, indeed, Secretary of the Interior, which\r\ncorresponds with the position of the Premier in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SURVEYS.\r\n\r\nAccording to the American surveys the country is arranged in squares, as\r\nshown on all the maps. A \"section\" is a square mile, or 640 acres. A\r\n\"township\" is 36 sections, _i.e.,_ six miles on each of its four sides.\r\n\r\nA quarter section is 160 acres, and the lands are so arranged that a\r\nroadway is reserved around each quarter section 60 feet wide, and the\r\nland for such roadway is taken from each side, so that each owner has to\r\ncontribute 30 feet to such road, and, of course, he has the benefit of\r\nthe frontage to it. A 20 acre lot would be an eighth of a quarter\r\nsection. On some of the lots for sale at \"British Colony,\" are one or\r\ntwo houses and some buildings. These may be purchased thus: One house\r\nand buildings, 1,000 dollars; another house and buildings, 1,000\r\ndollars; another house and buildings (N.E.), 600 dollars; but if one\r\npurchaser bought four lots of 20 acres, each adjoining so that one house\r\nand buildings should come near the centre, then such house and buildings\r\nwould be given in.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF FRUIT CULTURE.\r\n\r\nFew settlers would have the requisite special knowledge of Fruit culture\r\nwithout some instruction, and, therefore, the owners of the land have\r\nengaged the services of Professor Eisen, at a fixed salary, so that all\r\nsettlers on their lands may have the benefit of the Professor's\r\ninstruction, _free of charge_. Professor Eisen is well known as a\r\nspecialist in horticulture in California. He has just published a book\r\non the raisin industry in California, which may be seen at our offices.\r\nThe culture of grapes for raisins, and plums for prunes, would be\r\nremarkably successful on the lands for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNED FRUITS.\r\n\r\nWholesale buyers come round the country to buy the Fruit crops while on\r\nthe trees. An enormous trade is done in America in canned Fruits; the\r\nhotels, steamers, railway cars, and private families use them largely at\r\nall meals, and America itself seems to be a sufficient market for ages\r\nto come for all the Fruit and vegetables its State of California can\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATES.\r\n\r\nHow to start with a capital of 20,000 dols.\r\n\r\n                                                 dols.\r\n    80 acres of land, 12,000 dols., half cost    6,000\r\n    Trees, such as orange, olive, fruit, etc.    2,000\r\n    House and barn                               2,500\r\n    Horses                                         400\r\n    Cow                                             50\r\n    Poultry                                         25\r\n    Furniture, etc.                                600\r\n    Waggon, tools, etc.                            400\r\n    Labour, per year, 3 men, etc., for, 3 years,\r\n      including living                           4,000\r\n    Interest on 6,000 dols. at 8%--480 dols. per\r\n      year, 3 years                              1,440\r\n                                                ------\r\n                                          dols. 17,415\r\n\r\nLeaving a balance of 2,585 dols. for first payment of land, or for other\r\nimprovements and unforeseen expenses.\r\n\r\nProfit the fourth year should be about 4,000 to 5000 dols. at the\r\nlowest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to start with a capital of 10,000 dols., i.e., say £2,000.\r\n\r\n                                   dols.   dols.\r\n\r\n    40 acres of land  ..  .. .. .. 6,000\r\n    House and barn    ..  .. .. .. 1,200\r\n    Well and pump     ..  .. .. ..   100\r\n    Horses            ..  .. .. ..   200\r\n    Waggon and tools  ..  .. .. ..   350\r\n    Furniture, etc    ..  .. .. ..   500\r\n    Cow               ..  .. .. ..    50\r\n    Trees, etc.       ..  .. .. .. 1,200\r\n    Seed, etc.        ..  .. .. ..   100\r\n                      ..  .. .. ..  ----   9,700\r\n    Living one year, etc.; incidentals ..    300\r\n                     ..  .. .. ..          -----\r\n                                    dols. 10,000\r\n\r\n    PROFITS.\r\n\r\n                                                 dols.   dols.\r\n    _First year_.--Land between the trees,\r\n    cultivated in potatoes, vegetables,\r\n    etc.                ..  .. .. ..              500\r\n    Poultry, eggs, etc. ..  .. .. ..              150\r\n                                                  ---     650\r\n\r\n\r\n(Eggs and poultry pay for groceries.

The farmer can take care\r\nof 20 acres himself, with occasional help. With 40 acres he requires one\r\nman more, his son or hired help.\r\n\r\nThe first three years he will only make his living ordinarily so; after\r\nthat time he will make money. Poultry, and vegetables should, during\r\nthe first year pay for all expenses at least, and in many instances\r\nleave a large surplus. All this depends upon the capacity of the\r\nsettler. With good land such as this 100 dollars or more could be made\r\nfrom vegetables the first season by a capable and experienced man. At\r\nleast it has been done repeatedly.\r\n\r\nIf poultry is properly cared for, a family will make its living by\r\nselling eggs and chickens until the trees come in bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to start with a capital of 8,000 dols., i.e., say £1,600.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       dols.\r\n\r\n        Land, 40 acres, 6,000 dols., half cost..  ..      3,000\r\n        House and barn    ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..      1,500\r\n        Horses    ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..        200\r\n        Cows and chickens ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..         75\r\n        Waggon and tools  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..        200\r\n        Sundries, tools, etc. ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..        400\r\n        Trees, etc.   ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..      1,200\r\n        Well and pump ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..        100\r\n        Or windmill and tank  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..        250\r\n        Interest on 3,000 dols. at 8 % for three years  ..  780\r\n        Sundries for living, etc. ..  ..  ..  ..  ..        295\r\n                                                          -----\r\n                                                    dols. 8,000\r\n\r\n        The fourth and fifth years there should be a gross\r\n        profit of at least 2,650 dols. a year, enough to pay for\r\n        the balance due on land.\r\n\r\n\r\n        How to start with, a capital of 5,000 dols.,\r\n        i.e., say £1,000.\r\n\r\n                                                      dols.\r\n        Land, 20 acres, 3,000 dols., half cost ..  .. 1,500\r\n        House and barn, etc.   ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  .. 1,000\r\n        Trees  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..   600\r\n        Horses ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..   200\r\n        Cow    ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..    50\r\n        Household furniture    ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..   100\r\n        Waggon and tools   ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..   200\r\n        Well and pump  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..   100\r\n\r\n        (If tank and windmill required, from 250 dols.\r\n        upwards extra).\r\n\r\n        Seed, etc. ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..    50\r\n        Sundry expenses and chickens   ..  ..  ..  ..   300\r\n        Interest for three years on balance of land\r\n            at 8%  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..  ..   360\r\n        Capital on hand to pay for part of the land..   840\r\n                                                      -----\r\n                                                dols. 5,300\r\n\r\n\r\n    What some people have started with, and\r\n    come out all right.\r\n\r\n                                                 dols.  dols.\r\n    Land, 3,000 dols., cash, balance credit             1000\r\n    House and barn                                       500\r\n    Horses                                         150\r\n    Cow                                             50\r\n    Poultry                                         25\r\n                                                   ___\r\n                                                         225\r\n\r\n    Provisions, sundries, etc                            100\r\n    Furniture and tools                                  150\r\n    Sundry expenses                                      100\r\n    Waggon and horses                                    150\r\n                                                       _____\r\n                                                 dols. 2,225\r\n\r\nBut ordinarily, this is too little, as the planting of the land cannot\r\nbe proceeded with at once, and work must be procured among the\r\nneighbours, etc.\r\n\r\nThe estimates, were furnished us by Professor Eisen, who remarked that,\r\nprobably, in giving estimates all persons would vary somewhat, but\r\nthese, and other estimates which he gave, are really more than\r\nestimates, because they are the actual results of past experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR EISEN'S OPINION.\r\n\r\nReceived January 20th, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Eisen writes:--\"I am of opinion that these lands (British\r\nColony, Merced) are amongst the very best in the State for raisins;\r\nstill, as I explained to you, I do not advise any one to put his whole\r\ninterest in the raisin industry, as the market for this Fruit is\r\nlimited. For other dried fruit, especially for prunes (French plums),\r\napricots, peaches, and nectarines, the market is practically unlimited,\r\nand as our population increases yearly 1,500,000 people, it will be seen\r\nthat our markets must extend as well, even after we have driven all\r\nforeign Fruits out of our home markets. As regards the adaptability of\r\nthe land of British Colony for various Fruits, I can say that they are\r\nespecially adapted to the prune (French plums) and peaches for drying\r\nand canning, olives for olive oil and pickling; also for oranges. You\r\ncan see how the orange thrives in the city of Merced and surroundings,\r\nor in localities exactly like those of British Colony lands, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that oranges and lemons will prove very profitable in\r\nBritish Colony. Olives will especially do well there. The British Colony\r\nlands I consider as exceptionally rich and fertile, and there are few,\r\nif any, equal to them in this State or anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE OF FRUIT TREES.\r\n\r\nThe prices in California of young Fruit trees for planting, for the\r\nseason 1890-91, are given as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                             dols.\r\n\r\n    Prunes (like French plums)        25 to 30 per 100\r\n\r\n    Plums and other prunes            15          \"\r\n\r\n    Apricots                          20          \"\r\n\r\n    Peaches, from                     15 to 17.50 \"\r\n\r\n    Olives (layers)                   20          \"\r\n\r\n    Olives, grafted                   40 to 60    \"\r\n\r\n    Pears                             18          \"\r\n\r\n    Oranges, best kinds               70 to 100   \"\r\n\r\n    Shade trees                       50          \"\r\n\r\n    Grape-vines (raisins)             12          \"\r\n\r\n    Persimmons                        15          \"\r\n\r\n    Walnuts, from                     15 to 35    \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN FRUIT TREES PAY.\r\n\r\nThe Fruit trees enumerated above would begin to bear the second year,\r\nbut only the fourth year would they bear any considerable amount; the\r\nfifth and sixth years they would come into good bearing, and should then\r\nyield a profit of, say, from 100 to 350 dollars per acre. At seven years\r\nthe orchard should be in full bearing, and never yield less than 150,\r\nand, possibly, 450 dollars per acre. Instances have been known when\r\nprunes, peaches, and pears have produced from 750 to 1,500 dollars per\r\nacre clear profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION OF A SETTLER.\r\n\r\nThe position of a settler, then, is that for the first three years he\r\ncannot depend upon his crop of Fruit to maintain him, but must either\r\nhave sufficient capital to support him during that time, or else earn\r\nhis living in some other way. To be idle, and live on capital, would\r\nnot, of course, suit any man who meant to succeed, and therefore he\r\nwould fill up his time in cultivating garden and poultry produce, for\r\nwhich there is always a demand, or in getting some occasional\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST OF BOARD AND LODGING.\r\n\r\nAt Merced railway station is a very large hotel, and the cost of board\r\nand lodging for emigrants is only 25 dollars, _i.e.,_ say, £5 per month;\r\nto usual visitors it is 60 dollars a month.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISIN CULTURE.\r\n\r\nThe _Pacific Rural Press_, referring to the raisin vineyards in the San\r\nJoaquin Valley, California, states:--\r\n\r\n\"What is especially interesting to the home-seeker in connection with\r\nthis information, is the fact that everyone of these vineyardists is\r\nprosperous. No other horticultural industry is so profitable as the\r\nculture of the raisin grape, in no other is the work so pleasant, and no\r\nother yields a return so quickly.\"\r\n\r\nAn acre of Muscat vines in full bearing will yield from two to three\r\ntons of grapes on good heavy soil. At 5-1/2 cents a pound in the\r\nsweat-box, this means from 225 to 325 dollars per acre, gross. Numerous\r\ninstances are known, however, where the yield of an acre of Muscats\r\namounted to as much as 450 dollars, this being the result of careful\r\ncultivation and favourable circumstances. Some grapes are borne on the\r\nvines when they are one-year old, while two-year old's have been known\r\nto bear a crop. At three years the vines pay the expenses and interest\r\non the money invested, and at four years from planting they bring the\r\nfirst large paying crop.\r\n\r\nThe _Merced Argus_ says of raisin culture:--\r\n\r\n\"One of the great charms of raisin culture is the extreme simplicity of\r\nits operations. WHAT CAN BE MORE SIMPLE than to pick a bunch of Muscat\r\ngrapes from the vine, and lay it on the ground. In six days the bunch of\r\ngrapes, without being meanwhile touched, has assumed the appearance of a\r\nbunch of raisins, and has flattened out as if it had been pressed. It is\r\nthen carefully turned over, so as to expose the underside to the direct\r\naction of the sun. In eight days more it is a perfect bunch of raisins,\r\nand no act of man can improve it even in appearance. All the operations\r\nof fancy packing are so simple, that a child may learn them in a day. A\r\nsingle acre of raisin vines in a Merced Colony lot means handfuls of\r\nbright, golden double eagles to the bright-eyed children of the Merced\r\nfarmer in the near future.\r\n\r\n_Harper's Magazine_ for January, 1891, contains an article on\r\nCalifornia, which all persons interested in that State would do well to\r\nread. I extract a few statements:--\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION.\r\n\r\n\"A piece of land at Riverside, below the flow of water, was worth 300\r\ndollars an acre. Contiguous to it was another piece not irrigated, which\r\nwould not sell for 50 dollars an acre. By bringing water to it, it would\r\nquickly sell for 300 dollars, thus adding 250 dollars to its value. As\r\nthe estimate at River side is that one inch of water will irrigate five\r\nacres of Fruit land, five times 250 dollars would be 1,250 dollars per\r\ninch, at which price water for irrigation has actually been sold at\r\nRiverside.\r\n\r\n\"The standard of measurement of water in Southern California is the\r\nminer's inch under four inches pressure, or the amount that will flow\r\nthrough an inch-square opening under a pressure of four inches measured\r\nfrom the surface of the water in the conduit to the centre of the\r\nopening through which it flows. This is nine gallons a minute, or, as it\r\nis figured, 1,728 cubic feet or 12,960 gallons in 24 hours, and 1/50 of\r\na cubic foot a second. This flow would cover 10 acres about 18 inches\r\ndeep in a year; that is, it would give the land the equivalent of 18\r\ninches of rain, distributed exactly when and where it was needed, none\r\nbeing wasted, and more serviceable than 50 inches of rainfall as it\r\ngenerally comes. This, with the natural rainfall, is sufficient for\r\ncitrous Fruits and for corn and alfalfa, in soil not too sandy, and it\r\nis too much for grapes and all deciduous fruits.\r\n\r\n\"But irrigation, in order to be successful, must be intelligently\r\napplied. In unskilful hands it may work more damage than benefit. Mr.\r\nTheodore S. Van Dyke, who may always be quoted with confidence, says\r\nthat the ground should never he flooded; that water must not touch the\r\nplant or tree, or come near enough to make the soil bake around it; and\r\nthat it should be let in in small streams for two or three days, and not\r\nin large streams for a few hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVE CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\"The growth of the olive is to be, it seems to me, one of the leading\r\nand most permanent industries of Southern California. It will give us,\r\nwhat it is nearly impossible to buy now, pure olive oil, in place of the\r\ncotton seed and lard mixture in general use. It is a most wholesome and\r\npalatable article of food. Those whose chief experience of the olive is\r\nthe large, coarse, and not agreeable Spanish variety, used only as an\r\nappetizer, know little of the value of the best varieties as food,\r\nnutritious as meat, and always delicious. Good bread and a dish of\r\npickled olives make an excellent meal. A mature olive grove in good\r\nbearing is a fortune. I feel sure that within 25 years this will be one\r\nof the most profitable industries of California, and that the demand for\r\npure oil and edible fruit in the United States will drive out the\r\nadulterated and inferior present commercial products.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL OPENINGS.\r\n\r\nThere are now at Merced special openings for a nurseryman and a\r\ndairyman; the latter would be by growing alfalfa (lucerne) and raising\r\npoultry for at present the Merced people often have to get poultry and\r\neggs from San Francisco, 150 miles off.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO GROWING.\r\n\r\nA settler might make a really good return out of potatoes while his\r\nFruit trees are maturing, which is a food more in use in America than in\r\nEngland. Potatoes are not only served at luncheon and dinner, but also\r\nat breakfast everywhere, and, if every settler planted his land with\r\npotatoes, there would be no fear of overstocking the market.\r\n\r\nMr. Eisen states that potatoes yield from 50 to 400 sacks to the acre,\r\nand sell at prices varying from 90 cents to 2 dollars per sack. If only\r\n50 sacks were grown to the acre, it would show a scarce year, when\r\nprices would range higher, but the crop is never a failure in\r\nCalifornia. Two crops can be grown in a year; the first crop is planted\r\nat the end of February, if warm, or else in March, or indeed any time\r\ntill the middle of May, and dug three months after; the second crop is\r\nplanted in August or September, and dug three months after.\r\n\r\nTo put in the potatoes a settler would need the help of a labourer, to\r\nwhom he would have to give one dollar per day and his board, or, if the\r\nlabourer be a Chinaman, one dollar and a quarter per day without his\r\nboard. If the potatoes occupied ten acres, and they produced say 200\r\nsacks to the acre, and fetched 1 dollar per sack, that would yield 2,000\r\ndollars, or for the two crops 4,000 dollars, or, say, £800. This sounds\r\na large sum, but the land is exceedingly rich, as may be seen from the\r\nsamples I have brought back, and large results may be expected from it\r\nif properly worked, for, of course, in any undertaking the result\r\ndepends upon the way it is worked.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph is from an important paper or periodical of 20\r\npages, known as the _Pacific Rural Press_, of December 13th, 1890, and\r\nalthough the crop it mentions was not grown in California, it shows at\r\nleast what can be done on good ground:--\r\n\r\n\"Nearly 1,000 bushels of potatoes, or, to be exact, 974 bushels and 48\r\npounds, have been grown on one acre of land in Johnson County, Wyoming,\r\nthe past season. This crop wins the first prize of several hundred\r\ndollars offered by the _American Agriculturist_ for the largest yield of\r\npotatoes on one exact acre. It was grown on virgin soil without manure\r\nor fertilizer, but the land was rich in potash, and the copious\r\nirrigation was of water also rich in saline material. There were 22,800\r\nhills on one acre, and 1,560 pounds of sets, containing one, two, and\r\nthree eyes, were planted of the early Vermont and Manhattan varieties.\r\nThe profit on the crop on this first prize acre was 714 dollars,\r\nexclusive of 500 dollars in prizes.\"\r\n\r\nThus, this one acre would have produced £142 worth of potatoes. I do not\r\nmention it as an example of what a settler may or may not do at Merced,\r\nbut as the land at Merced which I am offering for sale is of the richest\r\nquality, rich results may certainly be expected.\r\n\r\n    COST OF GOODS, &c., AT MERCED.\r\n\r\n                    per lb.\r\n\r\n    Beef (to boil), 8 to 10 cents\r\n    Beef (steak), 10 cents\r\n    Beef (shoulder), 10 cents\r\n    Beef (choice), 12-1/2 cents\r\n    Beef (porterhouse and tenderloin), 15 cents\r\n    Veal, 10 to 15 cents\r\n    Mutton, 10 to 12-1/2 cents\r\n    Pork, 10 to 12-1/2 cents\r\n    Sausages, 12-1/ to 15 cents\r\n    Corned beef, 8 to 10 cents\r\n    Bacon, 12-1/2 cents\r\n    Hams, 15 cents\r\n    Tongues, 10 cents\r\n    Flour, 4-1/2 to 5 dollars for a barrel weighing 200 lbs.\r\n    Tea, 25 cents to 1 dollar\r\n    Coffee, 24 to 45 cents\r\n    Candles, 15 to 20 cents\r\n    Chocolate, 25 cents\r\n    Cod fish, 10 cents\r\n    Corn meal, 3 to 4 cents\r\n    Cocoa, 50 to 60 cents\r\n    Cracker biscuits, 8 to 10 cents\r\n    Graham flour, 3 to 5 cents\r\n    Macaroni, 15 cents\r\n    Oatmeal, 5 cents\r\n    Rolled oats, 6 cents\r\n    Rice, 5-1/2 to 8 cents\r\n    Salt, 1 to 2 cents\r\n    Soda, 4 cents\r\n    Starch, 10 cents\r\n    Sugar, 7 to 8 cents\r\n    Sugar (house), 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 cents\r\n    Butter, 25 to 40 cents\r\n    Eggs, 15 to 40 cents per dozen, according to season\r\n    Coal oil, 1.40 per 5-gallon can.\r\n\r\nOne of my clients recently visited England with his family, and says\r\nthat one can live cheaper at Merced than in England.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a twelve-roomed house is 3,000 to 4,000 dollars, according\r\nto finish, _i.e.,_ from £600 to £800. Most of the houses are built of\r\nwood, and such a house could be built in twenty to thirty days, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nStabling for two horses, with room for buggy, wagon, harness, and hay,\r\nwould cost 250 dollars or £50.\r\n\r\nA ten-roomed house would cost from 2,500 to 3,500 dollars, according to\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nAn eight-roomed house would cost from 2,000 to 2,500 dollars.\r\n\r\nA six roomed house would cost about 2,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nA four-roomed house would cost about 1,200 dollars.\r\n\r\nLive poultry cost about 6 dollars per dozen.\r\n\r\nCows, 25 to 50 dollars each. Horses, 75 to 150 dollars each. Sheep, 3 to\r\n4 dollars each.\r\n\r\nCultivators cost from 7 to 15 dollars each. Ploughs and harrows about\r\nthe same price. A riding cultivator, 45 to 50 dollars. Pruning shears, 3\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nDay labour costs 1 dollar per day and board; but, in harvest time, 1-1/2\r\ndollar per day and board.\r\n\r\nCarpenters, 2-1/2 dollars per day, sometimes with and sometimes without\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nFencing costs 500 dollars (_i.e_., £100) a mile. To fence a 20-acre lot\r\nwould cost 350 dollars (_i.e_., £70); but if the eight forming the\r\nquarter section joined together, it would cost each about 130 dollars\r\n(_i.e_., £26). The fence would be a 6-inch board at bottom, then 30\r\ninches of wire netting to keep out rabbits, then another 6-inch board\r\nand a barbed wire at top.\r\n\r\nFirewood costs 6 to 7 dollars a cord of hard wood, or 5 to 6 dollars of\r\nwillow wood; a cord of wood is 4-ft. by 4-ft. by 8-ft.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKE CLOTHING AND BRIC-A-BRAC.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of clothing are dear. A good suit would cost £7 to £8, or, if\r\nready made, £5. Settlers should therefore take with them plenty of\r\nclothes, sufficient, say, to last for five years, including boots,\r\nblankets, linen, etc.; also _bric-a-brac,_ and anything to add\r\ncheerfulness and refinement to the home, but they should not take\r\nfurniture nor animals.

The substances found in the soluble inorganic matter of soils\r\nare lime, magnesia, alumina, silica, phosphoric acid, oxide of iron,\r\noxide of manganese, potash and soda. The insoluble mineral matter is\r\nnearly all silica. There is very little clayey matter in any of the\r\nsoils--not more than about five per cent. All the soils are remarkably\r\nfree from stones or pebbles, or even coarse sand.\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen that these soils, while possessing a\r\nlarge amount of matter available for plant growth, are exceedingly\r\nfriable, and would be very easily worked. They would absorb heat\r\nquickly, and from their porosity would require little drainage, and so\r\nwould be both warm and dry soils, and form fertile land suitable for\r\nalmost all kinds of agricultural and horticultural produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF MY CLIENTS, THE VENDORS.\r\n\r\nMy clients, the owners of the land called \"British Colony,\" at Merced,\r\nare well-known persons--well-known as men of great wealth, and as\r\ngentlemen of undoubted integrity, the Hon. Charles Crocker and Mr. C.H.\r\nHuffman, whose enterprises in railway, canal, and other public works,\r\nhave been of gigantic proportions.\r\n\r\nI have every confidence myself in dealing with these gentlemen, and I\r\nsubmit that my friends, clients, and the general public, who may be\r\nwilling to take up any of this \"British Colony\" land at Merced, may have\r\nfull confidence, too, that they will at least be treated justly, and\r\nmore than that is not expected from strangers in business; but I believe\r\nthat I might add they would be treated liberally if necessity arose, and\r\nI have ground for this statement from what I have heard of their\r\ntreatment of other persons who have settled in one of their other\r\n\"Colonies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA, MERCED.\r\n\r\nI have for sale besides the estate designated \"British Colony,\" a tract\r\nof land belonging to a well-known merchant in the City of London, who\r\nhas owned it for 13 years. It comprises 5,084 acres, and has a\r\nregistered Government title. Price 30 dollars per acre, and 7 years'\r\ncredit would be given if 20 per cent. is paid down. Part of it is well\r\nsuited for Fruit growing, but as yet the water from the canals belonging\r\nto my other clients has not been taken to it. It has, however, some\r\ncreeks upon it, but they are frequently dry. The land is of a rolling\r\nprairie character, and is now let at a nominal rent of 25 cents per acre\r\nfor sheep farming. The soil is varied; some of it is a good loam, some\r\nof a clayey nature, and some stony; there is a shepherd's house, with\r\nbarn and yard. The taxes upon it are about 15 to 20 cents per acre. One\r\nhalf of the land would be sold separately, but it must be the half\r\nfarthest from the side where the canals are. The situation is an\r\nattractive one as the undulations really form the first foothills of the\r\nSierra Nevada Mountains, of which there is a grand view. This land is\r\nwell worth buying, as when water is obtained, the price will then be\r\nincreased to that asked for other irrigated Fruit lands.\r\n\r\nA plan may be seen at my offices, 3, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLondon:\r\n\r\nPrinted by Vincent Brooks, Day & Son, Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO OWNERS OF LANDS AND HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIRED TO PURCHASE.\r\n\r\n_Messrs.
