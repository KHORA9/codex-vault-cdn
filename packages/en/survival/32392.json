BEVAN\r\n\r\n_Director of Agriculture, Cyprus_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intention of these notes is to make available to those interested in\r\nthe agriculture of Cyprus some of the information scattered in various\r\nreports, leaflets and correspondence not readily accessible to the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a matter of regret to the writer that the valuable\r\nstores of information collected with so much care and ability by the\r\nlate Mr. Panayiotis Gennadius, formerly Director of Agriculture in\r\nCyprus, through having been published in Greek only, have remained\r\nbeyond the reach of many who might otherwise have derived benefit from a\r\nstudy of his works. His writings on the general agriculture of the \"Near\r\nEast\" are voluminous and comprehensive, and show an intimate knowledge\r\nof the subject as well as of the practices and customs of agriculturists\r\nin these regions. The results of his labours are mainly embodied in his\r\n_Helleniki Georgia_ and his _Phytologikon Lexicon_, both of which are\r\nworks of recognised authority. During his eight years (1896-1903) spent\r\nin Cyprus Mr. Gennadius devoted himself specially to a study of the\r\nagricultural conditions and needs of the Island, and the notes and\r\nreports made by him have been, to a large extent, taken as the basis of\r\nthe present Notes.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteen years since he left the Island many changes have\r\ntaken place, and the more receptive and enlightened attitude of the\r\nrising generation of farmers has helped to bring about various\r\nimprovements, and a greater readiness has been shown to adopt modern\r\nmethods. In compiling the present Notes I have drawn freely from the\r\narticles which have appeared for many years in the _Cyprus Agricultural\r\nJournal_ (formerly _Cyprus Journal_), the official publication of the\r\nAgricultural Department, and which I have edited; I have also taken\r\nadvantage of the very admirable and reliable information contained in\r\nthe _Handbook of Cyprus_, edited by Messrs. Lukach and Jardine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH MAP Of CYPRUS SHOWING DISTRIBUTION OF CROPS &\r\nFORESTS]\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to the willing assistance of Mr. Procopios\r\nSymeonides, Inspector of Agriculture, whose thorough acquaintance with\r\nlocal conditions and usages has enabled him to contribute much useful\r\nand informative material. I have also to offer my acknowledgments to\r\nMessrs. M. G. Dervishian, C. Pelaghias, Z. Solomides, G. Frangos, A.\r\nKlokaris, A. Panaretos and others who have kindly supplied me with data\r\nof various kinds.\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely be necessary to add that little more than a summary of\r\nthe agricultural practice and resources of the Island has here been\r\nattempted, and in no sense does it pretend to be anything more. The aim\r\nhas been to give the reader a general idea of what Cypriot agriculture\r\nis and, to some extent, what it is capable of doing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Reprinted from the BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE,\r\n1919.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Features_\r\n\r\nThe Island of Cyprus is situated in the innermost basin of the\r\nMediterranean Sea; about 40 miles distant from the Asia Minor coast on\r\nthe north, and about 60 miles from Syria on the east, and 238 miles from\r\nPort Said to the south. It is the third largest island in the\r\nMediterranean, ranking next to Sicily and Sardinia. The larger part of\r\nthe Island is in the form of an irregular parallelogram, 100 miles long\r\nand from 30 to 60 miles broad; while on the north the eastern extremity\r\nruns out beyond this into a peninsula 40 miles long by 5 to 6 miles\r\nbroad. The total area is 3,584 sq. miles. The main topographical\r\nfeatures are the northern and southern mountain ranges running east and\r\nwest and enclosing the great plain of the Messaoria. The mountains of\r\nthe northern range are of an altitude ranging from 2,000 ft. to over\r\n3,000 ft., the highest point being Buffavento, 3,135 ft.; those of the\r\nsouthern range are more lofty and culminate in Mt. Olympus, 6,406 ft.\r\nabove sea-level. The rivers are nearly all mountain torrents, and are\r\ndry from about July to November or December.\r\n\r\nThe area of cultivated land is approximately 1,200,000 acres, and that\r\nof the uncultivated land 1,093,760 acres, of which about 450,000 are\r\nforest land and 320,000 are susceptible of cultivation. The Messaoria\r\nplain is the great corn-growing area.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate and Rainfall_\r\n\r\nThere are considerable extremes of temperature in the plains. In summer\r\nit is very hot and dry with temperature ranging during June to September\r\nfrom 80° to 110° Fahr., while in winter slight frosts not infrequently\r\noccur. The climate is more equable, but also more humid, along the\r\ncoasts. In the plains there is, during the greater part of the year, a\r\nmarked variation between the day and night temperatures.\r\n\r\nOfficial records show that for a period of thirty-two years up to 1915\r\nthe average rainfall for hill and plain for the whole Island\r\napproximated to 20 inches. Up to 1902 records were kept only in the six\r\ndistrict towns, but since then there have been some fifty recording\r\nstations. The mean rainfall during the winter months for the twelve\r\nyears ended 1914 was 18.55 inches. That for the whole year during the\r\nlatter period was 21.18 inches.\r\n\r\nThe incidence of rainfall, apart from its volume, is of importance. It\r\nis on the rainfall of the six winter months, October to March, that the\r\nprosperity of the Island depends, and any shortage during this period\r\ncannot be balanced by heavier summer rains, which are more liable to\r\ncause harm than good, by damaging the corn lying on the threshing-floors\r\nand by causing sudden floods.\r\n\r\nMuch importance attaches to the rains in March, without which the grain\r\ncrop, however ample the earlier rains may have been, will not be\r\nsatisfactory, as described in a maxim which I have attempted to render\r\nin English.\r\n\r\n  If twice in March it chance to rain,\r\n    In April once, a shower in May,\r\n  In weight in gold of man and wain,\r\n    The farmer's crops are sure to pay.\r\n  If roads are dry at Christmas time,\r\n    But Epiphany finds both mud and slime,\r\n  And at Carnival they still hold many a pool,\r\n    The farmer finds his barns quite full.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Administration_\r\n\r\nThe Island is administered by a High Commissioner. There is an Executive\r\nCouncil and a Legislative Council consisting of six official members and\r\ntwelve elected members, of whom three are elected by the Moslem and nine\r\nby the non-Moslem inhabitants. The Island is divided into six districts,\r\nin each of which the Executive Government is represented by a\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weights, Measures and Currency_\r\n\r\nNearly everything except corn, wine, oil, carobs, cotton and wool is\r\nsold by the oke.\r\n\r\nAn oke, dry measure, equals 400 drams, or 2-4/5 lb.\r\n\r\nThe liquid oke is reckoned as equivalent to a quart.\r\n\r\nGrain is measured by the kilé, regarded as equal to a bushel.\r\n\r\nWool, cotton and oil are sold by the litre of 2-4/5 okes, but commonly\r\nreckoned as 2-1/2 okes.\r\n\r\nCarobs are sold by the Aleppo cantar of 180 okes. This cantar is further\r\ndivided into 100 litres of 1 oke and 320 drams each.\r\n\r\nWine is sold by the kartos = 4 okes, the kouza = 8 okes, and the gomari\r\n= 128 okes.\r\n\r\n1 kilé of wheat weighs 20 to 22 okes.\r\n\r\n1 kilé of barley weighs 14 to 18 okes.\r\n\r\n1 kilé of oats weighs 13 to 14 okes.\r\n\r\n1 kilé of vetches weighs 23 to 24 okes.\r\n\r\n1 sack of straw weighs about 40 okes.\r\n\r\n1 camel-load of straw weighs about 200 okes, consisting of 2 sacks, each\r\nweighing about 100 okes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measures of Length_\r\n\r\nMetron or metre.\r\n\r\nYarda or yard.\r\n\r\nPic = 2 ft. or two-thirds of a yard.\r\n\r\nInch = English measure.\r\n\r\nThe land measure is the donum (called by the villagers \"scala\"), but it\r\nis very uncertain, and varies in different parts of the Island. As\r\nrecognised by law, 1 donum, called \"tappoo donum,\" equals 60 pics = 40\r\nyards square = 1,600 square yards, or 14,400 sq. ft.; 3.025 of these\r\ndonums go to the acre. There is also a farmer's, or \"reshper\" donum,\r\nwhich is commonly used by agriculturists and is equal to about 1-1/2\r\nGovernment donums. For general purposes a legal donum is about one-third\r\nand a Cypriot farmer's donum about one-half of an acre. \"Stremma\" is\r\nalso a synonym for the farmer's donum, or scala, although its actual\r\nmeasure is very much less.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Currency_\r\n\r\n£1 = 20 shillings or 180 copper piastres.\r\n\r\n1 shilling = 9 copper piastres.\r\n\r\n1 cp. (copper piastre) = 40 paras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n_General_\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the main industry of the Island, which is favourably\r\nsituated for the markets of Egypt, Syria and Asia Minor, although the\r\nformer is practically the only buyer of its perishable produce. During\r\nrecent years the Cypriot agriculturist has come to realise more and more\r\nthe value of the Egyptian market and a considerable trade with that\r\ncountry has grown up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Land Tenure and Labour_\r\n\r\nThe small farmer mostly cultivates his own land, whereas the large\r\nlandowner rarely does. The metayer, or metairie, system is fairly\r\ncommon, and has much to recommend it when honourably carried out by both\r\nparties, but it is open to very serious abuse.\r\n\r\nUnder this system the one party, or contractor, gives the seed and often\r\nlends the cattle. A valuation of the latter is made at the time of\r\nentering into the agreement, and a re-valuation is made on termination,\r\nany depreciation being made good by the other party, or metayer. The\r\nlatter finds the necessary labour and feeds the animals and pays an\r\nagreed rate for their hire. The crops, after deduction of Government\r\ntithe, are usually divided equally between both parties, but the\r\nconditions vary according to circumstances and the nature of the crops\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nIf cultivated land be given to the partner, such land must be returned\r\nto the contractor in the same state of cultivation as received, or the\r\ncontractor, at his option, may claim the return of the seed his partner\r\nreceived with it.\r\n\r\nThere are also a considerable number of leaseholders paying a fixed\r\nrent. The monasteries are the largest landowners, and both cultivate\r\ntheir own land and let out portions to the monks or to private farmers.\r\nMuch land is also held by the Church, and this is frequently let out on\r\na yearly lease, with the result that it is badly farmed and speedily\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\nThe country is rather sparsely populated by about 275,000 inhabitants,\r\nand although the cultivators are laborious when working for themselves\r\nand when free from the hands of the usurers, they are still very\r\nbackward in their methods and appliances. A less conservative attitude\r\nhas of late been observed, and a greater readiness has been manifested\r\nin seeking and following the advice of the Agricultural Department.\r\nThere is a great amount of indebtedness among the peasantry and usurious\r\npractices abound. This undoubtedly checks progress, as few of the\r\nsmaller farmers are free agents. The matter has lately been the subject\r\nof a special Commission appointed by Government. Laws have this year\r\n(1919) been passed by the Legislative Council dealing with usury and\r\nindebtedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tithes and Taxation_\r\n\r\nThe tithe, which forms the principal source of Government revenue, is\r\none-tenth of the produce of the land on wheat, barley, oats, vetches,\r\nrye and favetta, measured on the threshing-floors and delivered in kind\r\nat the Government Grain Stores. Certain allowances are made to the\r\ntithe-payers for transport. In the case of carobs, which are also\r\nsubject to this tax, the tithe is taken in money from exporters at the\r\nCustom House at the rate of 9 cp. (1s.) per cantar from the districts of\r\nNicosia, Larnaca and Limassol, and 8 cp. per cantar from the other three\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nThere are certain export dues, in lieu of tithe, payable on the\r\nfollowing commodities: Aniseed 33 cp., cotton 55 cp., linseed 18 cp.,\r\nmavrokokko (black cummin) 7 cp., and raisins 10 cp. per 100 okes; silk\r\ncocoons 6-3/4 cp., wound silk 18 cp., silk manufactured by other than\r\nhand looms 18 cp. per oke.\r\n\r\nAn annual tax is levied of 3-3/4 cp. per head on every sheep and of 5\r\ncp. per head on every goat one year old and upwards, and of 4-1/2 cp.\r\nper head on every pig over three months old.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Credit and Agricultural Societies_\r\n\r\nThe spirit of co-operation has hitherto been singularly lacking, but\r\nthere are signs that a change is in progress and that, with proper\r\nguidance, the cultivators will ere long come to realise the advantages\r\nof combined effort in the production and distribution of their crops.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of village co-operative Credit Societies has long been\r\nadvocated, but although a law was passed in 1913 for this purpose, there\r\nhas so far been little practical outcome. Co-operation in its full\r\nmodern significance is not yet understood; but one or two little village\r\nco-operative banks have nevertheless been started and show encouraging\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few small village agricultural societies springing up,\r\nwhich, if properly conducted, may prove the pioneers of a general\r\nmovement in this direction. The existence of such societies would\r\ngreatly facilitate the work of the Agricultural Department, which would\r\nbe able to influence and assist farmers through their societies, whereas\r\nnow it is often not possible to reach them individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irrigation_\r\n\r\nThe most common method of raising water is by means of primitive\r\nwater-wheels or \"alakatia,\" often described as \"Persian wheels\" and\r\nresembling the \"sakia\" of Egypt. By these the water is carried in\r\nearthenware cups attached to the rim of a large vertical wooden wheel\r\nfixed in the mouth of a well and made to revolve by a mule or donkey by\r\nmeans of a horizontal wheel and beam, or by modern air-motor. Myrtle\r\nbranches are mostly employed for attaching the cups to the wheels, as\r\nthese are pliable and resist the action of water.\r\n\r\nThese \"alakatia\" were formerly made entirely of wood, but in the\r\nnineties, iron ones (\"noria\") were introduced from Greece, and these\r\nhave become fairly general, and are gradually supplanting the older\r\ntypes. They have the advantage of being more durable and lighter to\r\nwork. Good iron wheel wells are now locally made. Water-wheels of this\r\ndescription cannot be used for raising water from a depth of more than\r\nten fathoms below the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nOf late years a large number of air-motors of Canadian pattern have been\r\nintroduced and are found satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence in the remains of old disused Venetian wells\r\nand cisterns that in pre-Turkish times, when the country was far more\r\ndensely populated than at present, a larger quantity of underground\r\nwater was utilised than now. Abundant subterranean water for\r\nagricultural and gardening purposes is to be found in almost all the\r\ncoast lands as well as in many parts of the interior. Such waters are\r\neither brought to the surface along subterranean channels or by means of\r\nwells, and, for the most part, have their origin in the mountain ranges,\r\nspecially in the southern range, which is the rainy region of the\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nArtesian well-boring experiments have been made in recent years in\r\ndifferent parts of the Island, but without substantial results. In the\r\nFamagusta district large reservoirs were constructed several years ago\r\nfor impounding the surplus water of the rivers of Pedias and Ialias, but\r\nthese have only been very partially successful as the water is mostly\r\nlost before it reaches them.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory solution of the water problem is of supreme importance to\r\nthe Island. There are large fertile areas which every year remain\r\nfallow, but which, if capable of irrigation, would grow excellent cotton\r\nand other summer crops, thus providing a better system of rotation.\r\nVegetable growing and fruit culture could then also be very greatly\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Implements_\r\n\r\n_Ploughs._--The old wooden plough of the East is still the common plough\r\nof the country (see Plate I, fig. 1). Efforts were made from 10 to 15\r\nyears ago to introduce iron ploughs by selling them through the\r\nAgricultural Department at half the cost price and even less.\r\nHigh-water mark was reached in 1908 when 102 of these ploughs were so\r\nsold. These were much approved of, and the further sale was then left in\r\nthe hands of merchants. The demand at once fell off and since then only\r\na few have been introduced. For a year or two a certain number of iron\r\nploughs of Russian make were imported and sold through the Jewish\r\nsettlement at Margo.\r\n\r\nThere is now a considerable demand which it may be possible to satisfy\r\nwhen normal conditions are resumed. There is some prejudice against\r\nEnglish-made ploughs on the score of weight, as they are mostly heavier\r\nthan those of French, Russian, Greek and American make.\r\n\r\n_Harrow._--The native harrow, \"saraclo,\" is a wooden beam about 10 ft.\r\nlong by 12 to 18 in. broad and 3 in. thick, on which the labourer stands\r\nas it is drawn over the newly sown land. It is ineffective inasmuch as\r\nit does not break the clods, but merely presses them into the ground.\r\nIron-toothed harrows and spring-toothed harrows have been lent by the\r\nDepartment for demonstration purposes to different persons, and these,\r\nparticularly the second kind, have found favour and are likely to be in\r\ndemand for covering the sown seed. The usual method is to cover the seed\r\nwith the native plough, but the European harrow is seen to do the work\r\nmore effectively and with a great economy of time.\r\n\r\nAmong the more common agricultural tools of native pattern are the\r\nfollowing (see Plate II):\r\n\r\n_Tsappa_ (hoe).--The wider tool, 5 in. to 6 in., is mostly for garden\r\nuse; the narrow tsappa, about 3 in. wide, is for field work.\r\n\r\n_Skalistiri._--A kind of small tsappa, 2 in. wide, having two prongs 4\r\nin. to 5 in. long at the opposite end. It is mostly used for hoeing\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Ploughing on a Mountain-side with Native Plough.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--Newly-prepared Beds in Experimental Gardens.]\r\n\r\n_Xinari_ (axe or hatchet).--One end of the implement is a sort of\r\nhoe, and the other end is shaped like a mattock. Used for cleaning off\r\nweeds, shrubs, etc., from the fields; also for cutting or splitting\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n_Kouspos._--These are of two kinds. The larger is used like a tsappa,\r\nbut in stony or rocky places; the smaller is the tool used by\r\nwell-sinkers. It can be conveniently handled in a confined space.\r\n\r\n_Karetta_ or _Cart_.--This has almost entirely superseded the old\r\nCypriot type of cart, but the latter may yet be seen very occasionally\r\nin the Karpas and possibly in the Paphos district. It is still in use in\r\nsome parts of Anatolia. In its construction no iron nails are needed.\r\n\r\n_Doukani._--The common threshing-board (see under \"Cereals,\" p. 29).\r\nThis is the primitive implement handed down from classic times and\r\ngenerally seen throughout the East (see Plate V, fig. 2).\r\n\r\n_Thernatchin._--A wooden shovel used for winnowing grain. It is deeply\r\nserrated, or divided, into 5 or 6 triangular-shaped teeth.\r\n\r\n_Arvalin._--A corn sieve. A goat's or sheep's skin, perforated with\r\nholes, is stretched across a round wooden frame, 12 in. to 18 in. in\r\ndiameter. Instead of a skin, leather thongs or gut are stretched,\r\ncrosswise on the frame. Perforated tin is now sometimes employed. These\r\nsieves are used for cleaning grain after winnowing.\r\n\r\n_Arkon._--Another kind of sieve, similar to the above, but with smaller\r\nholes for sifting fine seeds, dust, etc. Mostly made of skin, but now\r\ntin is being used.\r\n\r\n_Patourin._--A similar sieve, used for still finer work.\r\n\r\n_Skala._--An iron dibber, fitted with two wooden handles, used for\r\nplanting vine cuttings.\r\n\r\nSome advance has been made of late in cleaning the land, but foul land\r\nis pretty general. Squills, thistles, thorny bushes, and so forth\r\nabound; these are mostly deeply rooted, drought-resistant plants, and\r\nthe labour required for uprooting them is not forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThere are a fair number of reaping machines now in use, but little care\r\nis bestowed on them, and when slightly out of order they are often put\r\naside as useless. More enlightened ideas are now prevailing, and the\r\nabundant crops of the last few years have created a strong desire for\r\nmore reapers and also for threshing machines, of which there are at\r\npresent barely half a dozen in the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Agricultural Department_\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department was established on a small scale in 1896,\r\nunder the direction of Mr. P. Gennadius. It continued much on its\r\noriginal lines until 1912, when its establishment was enlarged, and the\r\nGovernment Farm and the Veterinary Branch were attached to the\r\nDepartment, and again in 1914 it underwent a further slight extension\r\nwhich was necessarily checked by the war. There is now a staff of\r\ninspectors, district overseers and agricultural demonstrators who are\r\noccupied in continually travelling in the country, advising and giving\r\npractical assistance to cultivators, lecturing on village wine-making,\r\npoultry-keeping, bee-keeping, on the action to be taken against various\r\npests and so forth.\r\n\r\nThere are some eight Government Nursery Gardens in the districts from\r\nwhich large numbers of trees, plants and seeds are issued. A system of\r\nModel Orchards and Vineyards, newly started, is giving satisfactory\r\nresults. These are intended to assist those engaged in the production of\r\nfruit and vegetables, for which an unlimited market is close at hand in\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nSeventy School Gardens are in existence throughout the Island under the\r\nguidance and control of the Department. By their means many young fruit\r\ntrees and other plants and seeds are annually distributed at low rates,\r\nbetter methods of cultivation and new kinds of vegetable and fodder\r\nplants are being made known, and the village boys are being taught\r\nsomething about the work on which they will later depend for their\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Implements._\r\n\r\n1, Arvalin for barley and oats. 2, Arvalin for wheat and vetches. 3,\r\nShovel for winnowing. 4, Thernatchin. 5, Arkon. 6, Patourin. 7, Tsappa,\r\nnarrow, for field use. 8, Tsappa, wide, for garden use. 9, Xinari. 10,\r\nKouspos. 11, Skalistiri.]\r\n\r\nAn Agricultural School for the sons of farmers was opened at Nicosia in\r\n1913 under the direction of the Agricultural Department. Some twenty to\r\ntwenty-five lads between sixteen and twenty years of age, both Greeks\r\nand Moslems, receive a two-year course of instruction with a view to\r\nfitting them to cultivate their own properties later. A few of the more\r\npromising students have been retained as student-labourers in the\r\nDepartment, after the termination of their school course, and of\r\nthese again a few have been given minor appointments in the Department.\r\nA scheme for training young Cypriots abroad, which was in abeyance\r\nduring the war, makes it possible to give the more capable of these some\r\nfurther training in Europe in the higher branches of agriculture. It is\r\nhoped, by this means, to form a group of native experts from among whom\r\nthe technical staff of the Department can be recruited.\r\n\r\nThe Government Farm, Athalassa, though somewhat ill-placed for purposes\r\nof education and demonstration, has done good work in improving the live\r\nstock of the country, as evidenced at the Animal Shows held every year.\r\nPeriodical auction sales of Athalassa stock take place in the different\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years 1915-18, there were reared at the Farm and\r\ndistributed 41 cattle, 264 sheep, 8 donkeys, 332 pigs and 2 mules,\r\nbesides a considerable head of poultry.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the live and dead stock was estimated on March 31,\r\n1918, at £3,128.\r\n\r\nFor breeding purposes there were 6 stallion horses, 8 jack donkeys, 8\r\nbulls and 7 boars in 1917-18 stationed either at Athalassa or at the\r\nstud stables which have been established in the districts. Some 30 cast\r\narmy mares have been obtained free of cost from the Remount Department,\r\nEgypt, and have been lent out on contract to farmers for mule breeding.\r\n\r\nDuring 1917-18 the Farm produced 169 cheeses and 1,036-1/2 lb. of\r\nbutter. In the winter of 1917-18 some 314 donums of land were under\r\ncultivation, the chief crops being barley, oats, wheat and gavetta\r\n(_Lathyrus sativus_).\r\n\r\nThe Veterinary Establishment provides for 1 Veterinary Surgeon, 2 Stock\r\nInspectors and 1 Veterinary Compounder. There is a good deal of endemic\r\ncontagious disease among the flocks and herds of the Island, mainly\r\nanthrax and goat- and sheep-pox, and the Veterinary staff is kept busy.\r\nCattle plague is unknown in the Island.\r\n\r\nCattle breeding should become a paying industry when once the lesson of\r\nproper feeding and management has been learnt (hitherto sadly neglected\r\nby the Cypriot farmer), since Egypt provides a ready and remunerative\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no work is of more importance than that of combating the\r\nnumerous insect and other pests which every year cause heavy loss to the\r\nagricultural community. The addition of an Entomological Laboratory and\r\nthe appointment of an Entomologist have enabled the Department to afford\r\nrelief to many cultivators, and a small but active entomological staff\r\nare constantly engaged on various pest campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe Department possesses a small but well-equipped Chemical Laboratory\r\nunder the charge of an Agricultural Chemist. In the absence of any law,\r\nthe Department has, in the interests of importers and agriculturists\r\nalike, offered its services for analysing and reporting upon samples,\r\nsealing bags and giving advice as to the use of the different types, and\r\nthis action has been readily availed of. This in itself, however, is not\r\nenough to check malpractices or safeguard the cultivators.\r\n\r\nFor the last four years the Department has had trial plots in which new\r\nvarieties of cereals and fodder plants have been experimentally grown\r\n(see Plate I, fig. 2). The seed has been obtained from England, South\r\nAfrica, India and Australia, but so far none of the varieties have been\r\nfound in any marked degree superior to the native kinds. One or two\r\nvarieties introduced two years ago are promising, and when fully\r\nacclimatised may be worth the attention of farmers. Experimental sowings\r\nare often made in the villages when it is desired to bring any\r\nparticular crop to the notice of the agricultural classes.\r\n\r\nThe _Cyprus Agricultural Journal_, published quarterly in English, Greek\r\nand Turkish, is the official organ of the Agricultural Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fungoid Diseases and Insect Pests_\r\n\r\nThe Cypriot agriculturist has to contend against the attacks of many\r\nspecies of insects and a number of fungoid pests. Little could be done\r\nto bring these under control until, in 1914, an Entomological Branch of\r\nthe Agricultural Department was established. Much valuable research and\r\ndescriptive work had been carried out by Mr. Gennadius, but no organised\r\nfield work could be undertaken until the last three or four years.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the numerous pests cannot here be given, but\r\nthe more important ones are enumerated below. Happily Cyprus is one of\r\nthe few Mediterranean countries which has not been invaded by\r\nPhylloxera.\r\n\r\n_Cereals._--_Æcophora temperatella_ (Limassol district only), smut and\r\nrust, hessian fly (occasionally), grain weevils (_Calandra granaria_),\r\ngrain moth (_Sitotroga cerealella_).\r\n\r\n_Carobs._--_Cecidomyia ceratoniæ_, scale (_Aspidiotus ceratoniæ_)\r\n_Myelois ceratoniæ,_ borer (_Cossus liniperda_), _Oidium ceratoniæ_.\r\n\r\n_Olives._--_Capnodium_, scale (_Lecanium oleæ_ and _Aspidiotus oleæ_),\r\naphis (_Psylla oleæ_), olive fly (_Dacus_ sp.), _Tinea oleela_ and\r\nvarious borers.\r\n\r\n_Citrus and other Fruit Trees._--Gummosis (Citrus and all stone fruits);\r\nscale (all); ermin moth (apples, pears and plums); downy plant louse,\r\n_Schizoneura lanigera_ (apples); aphides (almond, peach, plum and\r\napricot); _Tingis pyri_ (pears and apples); codlin moth, _Carpocapsa\r\npomonella_ (apples, pears, quinces and walnuts); peach leaf curl,\r\n_Exoascus deformans_ (peaches); black aphis (peaches); Mediterranean\r\nfruit fly, _Ceratitis capitata_ (all); mites, _Acarus_ sp. (all);\r\nvarious borers, thrips, and barkbeetle (_Scolytids_).\r\n\r\n_Vines._--_Oidium Tuckeri_, _Peronospora_, anthracnose, _Cladosporium,_\r\nroot rot, _Zygæna ampelophaga_, thrips, _Cochylis_, _Lita solanella_.\r\n\r\n_Vegetables.--Peronospora infestans_ (potatoes), _Cladosporium_,\r\n_Altica_, aphides, mole crickets.\r\n\r\nMuch damage is done to carobs by the large rat, _Mus Alexandrinus_.\r\n\r\nThe large fruit-eating bat is a great pest. Hornets attack all kinds of\r\nfruits and cause much loss.\r\n\r\nThe chief cotton enemies are the cotton boll worm (_Earias insulana_),\r\naphides and _Capnodium_.\r\n\r\nLocusts are no longer the formidable plague they were in the eighties.\r\nThey are limited almost to the Famagusta district, where they annually\r\nbreed and do a certain amount of damage to early cotton and to vegetable\r\ncrops. If not vigilantly kept under control they would quickly multiply\r\nand become a serious danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. LIVE STOCK\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cattle_\r\n\r\nThe cattle of the country have been bred, until the last two or three\r\nyears, exclusively for draught purposes. Cattle breeding as a business\r\nis unknown. Farmers, as a rule, aim only at raising a calf or two every\r\nyear in order to maintain one or more yokes of oxen. Some of the draught\r\nanimals are very fine (see Plate III, fig. 1, and Plate V, fig. 1).\r\nThese belong mostly to the monasteries; one animal exhibited at a recent\r\nshow measured over 17 hands. The race is presumably the result of many\r\ncrossings with imported breeds, but has acquired a definite type. The\r\ncows are in colour and conformation not unlike Jerseys, but larger and\r\nwithout the udder development of that breed. The oxen have mostly a more\r\nor less pronounced hump, possibly acquired through many generations of\r\nprogenitors used exclusively for draught purposes. In some of the best\r\nbulls this hump is particularly marked.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 some Devon bulls and cows were imported and a herd of this breed\r\nwas started at the Government Farm, Athalassa. An impetus was thus given\r\nto breeding dairy cows, and a number of half- and three-quarter-bred\r\ncows are now to be found, which command high prices for milking\r\npurposes. The Devon bulls, however, have never come into favour among\r\nfarmers for raising draught cattle.\r\n\r\nThere was a fair export of cattle to Egypt before the war, a good\r\nproportion of the animals being consigned to the Serum Institute, Cairo,\r\nas Cyprus cattle, alone among the cattle in this part of the Levant,\r\nhave so far been free from plague.\r\n\r\nThe number of horned cattle in 1917 is officially given as 48,761.\r\n\r\nThe exports for the five years preceding the war were:\r\n\r\n  Year.  Number.  Value.\r\n                    £\r\n  1909  2,357    11,314\r\n  1910  4,240    20,218\r\n  1911  9,664    44,871\r\n  1912  5,751    34,303\r\n  1913  3,017    20,110\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Native Bull.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--Native Ram.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that if more attention were paid to growing\r\nfodder crops, cattle breeding could be greatly increased, and a good\r\ntrade with Egypt might be done.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Athalassa Stock Farm has had a most useful\r\ninfluence on the improvement of the live stock of the Island.\r\n\r\nBeef has only lately become an article of food for the country people,\r\nand is still so only on a small scale. The townspeople, having become\r\nEuropeanised to a greater degree than formerly, are now becoming beef\r\nconsumers, and the high price of beef has had a stimulating effect upon\r\nbreeding for the butchers. Before the British occupation the killing of\r\nan ox for eating purposes was considered by many villagers an act of\r\nsacrilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheep_\r\n\r\nSheep rearing is an important industry in Cyprus. The sheep are of the\r\nfat-tailed species and are allied, though superior to, the Afrikander\r\nsheep. The total number of sheep in the Island in 1917 was 255,150.\r\n\r\nThey feed almost entirely by grazing, and wander, under the charge of\r\nshepherds, over considerable areas in search of food, frequently in\r\ncompany with goats. They are valued chiefly for their milk and meat;\r\ntheir wool, though of moderate quality, is small in quantity. (See also\r\nunder \"Dairy Produce,\" p. 23.)\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of sheep are killed annually for local consumption, and\r\nthere is a regular export to Egypt, as shown by the following pre-war\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\n  Year.      Number.   Value.\r\n                         £\r\n  1904       13,923   10,544\r\n  1905        8,816    7,572\r\n  1906        5,427    5,470\r\n  1907        2,859    2,699\r\n  1908          849      835\r\n  1909          976      716\r\n  1910        3,905    3,064\r\n  1911       18,143   12,311\r\n  1912       17,611   13,731\r\n  1913        7,920    6,724\r\n\r\nSheep-folding is practically unknown, and no crops are specially grown\r\nas food for sheep. Occasionally they may get a little rovi (vetch), rovi\r\nstraw, lentil straw, favetta, pea-haulm or (in the hills) mavrachero\r\n(tares). They suffer in years of drought, but on the whole thrive\r\nwonderfully well on very scanty pasturage.\r\n\r\nGood work has been done of late years in the improvement of Cyprus sheep\r\nat the Government Athalassa Farm, and ewes and rams from the farm flock\r\nare much sought after by sheep-owners, many of whom are making efforts\r\nto ameliorate the breed. The question of providing suitable forage also\r\nis not being lost sight of.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Goats_\r\n\r\nThe goat has been a cause of much controversy for many years and a\r\nsource of discord between farmer and shepherd. Owing to the absence of\r\nfarm boundaries the herds of goats (and sheep) continually trespass on\r\nthe cultivated areas, and the shepherds are at little pains to restrain\r\nthem when there is a chance of the animals getting a good meal. Large\r\nsums in the aggregate are paid by way of fines and damages, but the\r\nshepherds evidently find that even so it is profitable to continue such\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the serious harm done every year in the State forests\r\nby these animals, a law \"For the gradual exclusion of goats from the\r\nIsland\" was passed in 1913 and came into operation on August 1 that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAs the subjoined table shows, the number of goats has decreased, but it\r\nis doubtful how far this is due to the law, and how far to the losses\r\nfrom goat-pox, which is very prevalent, and to the shipments for\r\nmilitary purposes during the war:\r\n\r\n  Year.                            Head.\r\n  1880                             210,736\r\n  1890                             237,475\r\n  1900                             243,397\r\n  1910                             276,794\r\n  1913 (when the law was passed)   242,524\r\n  1918                             191,017\r\n\r\nThe goat is in many respects well suited to the Island, and provides the\r\nvillager with milk, cheese, meat, boots and manure. The animals cost\r\nvery little to keep--even apart from their depredations--and thrive,\r\nespecially in the hills, under conditions unsuited to sheep and cattle.\r\nThey are, however, great enemies to agriculture and forestry, and if\r\nthey are to be preserved in the Island, it is essential that both they\r\nand the shepherds be brought under strict control.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus most of the goats have very short hair, which cannot be shorn.\r\nFrom this fact, and from the external shape of the animal, one may infer\r\nthat it is either a variety of the Anatolian breed modified by local\r\ninfluences, or a hybrid of the Numidic and Anatolian breeds (see Plate\r\nIII, fig. 2). The Anatolian goat has long and more or less thick hair,\r\nespecially on the shoulders, sides and thighs, which, clipped in the\r\nspring, yields a not insignificant income for the goat-breeder\r\n(Gennadius).\r\n\r\nThe Cyprus goat gives on an average 150 drams of milk per day during a\r\nperiod of say 150 days, or say, 50 to 60 okes per annum.\r\n\r\nA good proportion have kids twice a year, and many give birth to twins.\r\n\r\nThe price of a goat varies considerably in different districts, and\r\nbefore the war was from about 8_s._ to 20_s._ or 25_s._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pigs_\r\n\r\nThe Paphos district and the Karpas end of the Famagusta district are\r\nspecially given to pig raising; but this animal is to be found fairly\r\nwell distributed all over the Island. The native pig is of inferior\r\nquality, but a noticeable improvement, not only in pig breeding but in\r\npig rearing, has resulted from the introduction by Government of the\r\nLarge Black breed from England in 1907. This breed has become well\r\nestablished at the Government Farm, Athalassa, and the progeny is now\r\nwell spread over the Island. The improvement resulting from crossing\r\nwith Government stock has been so unmistakable that there is now great\r\ncompetition for them at all auction sales and high prices are given.\r\nThis increase in outlay on the part of farmers has led to greater care\r\nin the feeding and management. They find that well-bred pigs come more\r\nquickly to maturity, and that it pays to feed them well and not leave\r\nthem to forage for themselves as formerly. Excellent pork and bacon are\r\nnow procurable during the winter, and it may be hoped that pig breeding\r\nin Cyprus has a good future before it.\r\n\r\nThe number of pigs counted in the spring of 1914 was 38,850, the third\r\nhighest number on record. Since then, owing to the prohibition of\r\nexport, breeding has been checked and the number declined, but now it\r\nappears to be again on the upward grade.\r\n\r\nBefore the war there was an average annual export of about 2,000\r\nanimals; but there is now a better local market than formerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Camels_\r\n\r\nCamels are still used to a fair extent, and the breed is good, but owing\r\nto the improvement in the roads and increased facilities for more rapid\r\ntransport, these animals are less in demand than formerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Horses_\r\n\r\nThe native breed of horse is best seen in the Paphos pony, which though\r\nsmall, about 13 hands, is remarkably strong and hardy (see Plate IV,\r\nfig. 1). It is said that some eighty years or so ago the breed was\r\nimproved by the introduction of two Arab stallions from Turkey. A useful\r\nstamp of pony mare is also to be found in the Karpas. A marked\r\nimprovement in the quality of the local horses took place from the\r\nimportation, some years ago, of English pony stallions; and more\r\nrecently a further advance has resulted from the addition to the\r\nGovernment stud of the two famous English thoroughbred stallions\r\n\"Téméraire,\" by Greyleg out of Tereska by Isonomy out of Violetta by\r\nHermit, and \"Huckle-my-buff,\" by Isinglass out of Snip by Donovan out of\r\nIsabel (dam of St. Frusquin).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Donkeys_\r\n\r\nThe Cyprian donkey at its best is a fine animal (see Plate IV, fig. 2).\r\nIt is the common beast of burden of the villager, and is capable of\r\ncarrying a load of from 160 to 224 lb.\r\n\r\nA large number of donkey stallions have been exported to India,\r\nUganda, South Africa, Syria and Egypt from time to time, and the local\r\nbreed has no doubt suffered owing to the best jacks having left the\r\ncountry. Although the villagers depend so much upon these animals, very\r\nlittle care is taken by them, either in the matter of breeding, feeding\r\nor proper management. The animals are mostly worked far too early, and\r\nunderfed, and the majority are consequently undersized and of poor\r\nquality. Where good jacks are used, the progeny is generally\r\nsatisfactory, and at shows and fairs some fine specimens are usually\r\nbrought in. Owing to the increasing demand for jennets, the village\r\nbreeder is inclined to put his she-donkey to a pony stallion rather than\r\nto a jack-donkey. The donkey mares range from 13 to 13.2 hands, with\r\ngirth measurement of 58 in. to 60 in. and shank 6-1/2 in. They have\r\ngreat room, and are well shaped with a straight back and good quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Cyprus Pony.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--Cyprus Donkeys.]\r\n\r\nIt has been recommended that every encouragement should be given to the\r\nproduction of good donkeys, from which the best mares could be selected\r\nfor mating with suitable pony stallions, such as the Exmoor and Welsh\r\ncob, for the breeding of jennets; and at the same time an improvement in\r\nthe jacks would naturally follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jennets and Mules_\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the excellence of the Cyprus donkeys and the poor class of\r\nCyprus horses, the superiority of the 'jennet' (the result of mating the\r\npony stallion with the donkey mare) is very patent over the 'mule' (the\r\nproduct of the donkey jack and the pony mare). The jennet of from 13.1\r\nhands to 14.1 is doubtless the most paying animal that the Cyprus\r\nvillager or landowner can produce, and its excellence for army or\r\ngeneral pack purposes cannot be surpassed in any country in the world.\r\nTherefore, in my opinion, it is to this class of animal that the most\r\nencouragement in breeding should be given. To maintain the excellence of\r\nthe Cyprus jennet every help should be given to the breeding of big\r\ndonkeys, so that the plentiful supply of donkey mares of from 12.3 to\r\n13.3 hands is available for mating with suitable imported pony\r\nstallions, which should be placed by the Government at the breeders'\r\ndisposal.\"[2]\r\n\r\nBoth jennets and mules, indiscriminately called \"mularia,\" are largely\r\nused for transport purposes throughout the Island, and perform\r\npractically all the carting work of the country, but, as explained, the\r\njennet is regarded as greatly the superior animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Poultry_\r\n\r\nThe ordinary barn-door fowl is met with in Cyprus, as everywhere else.\r\nThe local breed is a mixture of all the various races which have been\r\nimported by private persons for many years past. The most general types\r\nmet with resemble the Leghorn and Ancona breeds.\r\n\r\nThe Island, owing to its climate and its corn production, is admirably\r\nsuited to the poultry industry, and a sure and profitable market in\r\nEgypt can always be relied on. Something has been done of late years by\r\nthe introduction of Wyandottes, Langshans and Orpingtons which have been\r\nbred by the Agricultural Department.\r\n\r\nProper poultry management among the villagers is practically unknown,\r\nand until regulations can be made enforceable by law for the control of\r\npoultry diseases and for the disposal of diseased carcases, poultry\r\nkeepers will continue to suffer heavy losses and the industry will not\r\nprosper.[3] Lectures on poultry-keeping have been instituted in the\r\ndistricts by the Agricultural Department, and it is hoped that these may\r\narouse some interest and lead to improvement.\r\n\r\nGiven the necessary guidance and control, the industry should have a\r\ngood future before it.\r\n\r\nTurkeys are very plentiful and, except in the hills, are seen in nearly\r\nevery village. There are three varieties--the bronze, by far the most\r\ngeneral, the white, and a dark brown kind which is not common.\r\n\r\nDucks and geese do well at Kythrea, but elsewhere are little seen. At\r\nthis village, however, they are largely bred.\r\n\r\nPigeons also are fairly abundant, and as they mostly feed on a\r\nneighbour's corn, they are considered profitable birds to keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preserved Meats, etc._\r\n\r\nA good deal of meat and fat is pickled, dried and smoked for consumption\r\nby the native population.\r\n\r\nHams and sausages are much eaten, the latter especially in the Karpas.\r\nAmong the various kinds of preserved meats may be specially mentioned\r\nthat known as \"apokti.\" This is the salted and dried flesh of the\r\nhe-goat, which, when cooked, is much appreciated by the villagers. The\r\nmeat is sometimes minced, and after the addition of ground origanum\r\nleaves and spearmint, is placed in jars and slowly cooked. It is said\r\nthat from 3,000 to 5,000 he-goats are annually slaughtered for making\r\n\"apokti.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Report by Captain Goodchild, Remount Department, E.E.F.,\r\nwhen visiting Cyprus in 1916 and 1917 to purchase mules and donkeys for\r\narmy purposes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Legislation in this direction has been effected during the\r\nsession of the Legislative Council just ended. (Law No. VII of 1919.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. DAIRY PRODUCE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milk_\r\n\r\nSheep and goats' milk is principally used for cheese and butter making.\r\nFresh milk of any kind is not much consumed by the native population,\r\nalthough within the last few years the more well-to-do townspeople have\r\ntaken to drinking cows' milk, when obtainable, and it is in growing\r\ndemand in some country parts for invalids when prescribed by the local\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nThe flavour of sheep and goats' milk is a good deal affected by the\r\nherbage or shrubs on which they feed, and thus varies according to\r\nlocality. A characteristic odour is imparted, for instance, by the\r\nalnifolia oak (_Quercus alnifolia_) and the cistus, which are common in\r\nmany parts of the Island, and the cheese and butter produced from such\r\nmilk are in better demand in the local markets. The places in which this\r\nquality of milk is chiefly produced are the Paphos District, the\r\nneighbourhood of Kykko and Troöditissa in the Troödos mountains, and\r\nAkanthou to the north-east of the Island.\r\n\r\nA considerable impetus has been given to the production and consumption\r\nof fresh cows' milk by the establishment of a herd of Devon dairy cows\r\nat the Government Farm, Athalassa. Cows of Athalassa strain fetch high\r\nprices, as much as £80 having been given recently for a cow and several\r\nothers have changed hands at £50 to £60.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cheese_\r\n\r\nThe Cypriot is a great cheese eater. The most popular and commonly made\r\ncheese in Cyprus is that known as Halloumi; the next in order being the\r\nPaphos and Akanthou cheeses, and then, in imitation of the Greek\r\ncheeses, the Agrafa, Kefalotyri and Kaskaval, all of which are of a hard\r\nkind, while there is a small production of the Greek soft cheeses Fetta\r\nand Telemés.\r\n\r\nThere are no statistics as to production; the export figures in recent\r\nyears as given in the official trade returns are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Year.       Quantity.   Value.\r\n               _Cwts._       £\r\n\r\n  1904       5,606       8,040\r\n  1905       4,705       7,245\r\n  1906       2,511       4,238\r\n  1907       2,200       4,559\r\n  1908       2,786       5,824\r\n  1909       2,367       4,927\r\n  1910       3,345       6,564\r\n  1911       3,647       6,624\r\n  1912       3,335       7,203\r\n  1913       3,699       9,268\r\n  1914       4,582      10,132\r\n\r\n_Halloumi._--This cheese, though rather insipid, is very popular, and\r\nforms a large part of the dietary of every household. It is easy to\r\nmake, needs no special appliances, and is almost entirely made by the\r\nshepherds themselves. It is made either from sheep's milk only, or, in\r\nthe hills where goats are numerous, from sheep and goats' milk mixed, or\r\nin some places from goats' milk only; especially is this so in the\r\nmountains where sheep are not found. The two kinds of cheese, _i.e._\r\nthat made from sheep's milk and that from goats' milk, are easily\r\ndistinguished, as the former is rather soft and crumbly, while the other\r\nis hard and separates out into flakes.\r\n\r\nThis cheese as it comes from the mould is in the form of a slab called\r\n\"kefali.\" This is then divided into four or more pieces.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of halloumi: one called \"mona\" (single), the other\r\n\"dipla\" (double). The latter is most in demand. It differs from the\r\nfirst in being finished off by being well hand-pressed, and then doubled\r\nor folded over, salt and spearmint being sprinkled between the fold.\r\n\r\n\"Myzithra,\" or, as it is more commonly called, \"anari,\" is a soft cheese\r\nproduced by boiling the whey, whereby all albuminoid substances not\r\npreviously coagulated are now coagulated and rise to the surface\r\ntogether with any pieces of curd still remaining in the whey. A good\r\nquantity of fat is also enclosed in the coagulated mass, which is placed\r\nin rush moulds or in cloths and pressed so as to squeeze out the whey.\r\n\"Anari\" thus made is specially known as \"bastard,\" and is an excellent\r\nsoft cheese, very popular among the European residents as well as among\r\nthe native inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA rather finer \"anari\" with slightly different flavour is made by adding\r\n5 to 10 per cent. of pure milk. This added milk is known as \"prosgalo.\"\r\n\r\nBoth kinds are dried in the sun.\r\n\r\nFrom \"anari\" is made a kind of fat used as cooking butter, by crushing\r\nand rubbing it between the hands in warm water. A thin paste is thus\r\nformed from which a fat separates, which rises to the surface, and is\r\nthen collected.\r\n\r\n_Paphos and Akanthou Cheeses._--These are prepared in much the same way\r\nas \"halloumi,\" but are made in smaller, barrel-shaped moulds, and are\r\nsteeped longer in the whey, which produces a rind and renders them\r\ntougher and less liable to crack. They are well rubbed with salt. Their\r\ncharacteristic flavour is doubtless due to some extent to the milk of\r\nthose districts, as explained above. Owing to their small size they\r\nbecome very hard.\r\n\r\n_Kefalotyri._--The best cheeses of this type are made with sheep's milk,\r\nwhich is coagulated at its natural temperature immediately after\r\nmilking. Rennet is added so as to produce coagulation within an hour.\r\nThe cheeses are placed in moulds, pressed and salted. They are turned\r\nand salted every day for a week; and this continues for two or three\r\nweeks, until the cheeses cannot absorb more salt.\r\n\r\n_Fetta._--The process for making this cheese is much the same as for\r\nPaphos cheeses, but differs in regard to temperature. It is placed in\r\nbags and hung up, or left in cheese cloths on the table to drain. It is\r\nmade up in 100 or 200 dram pieces, and turned and lightly salted for\r\nthree days; then placed in barrels filled with brine. This cheese ripens\r\nin a few days. It is soft, and has a sharp, pungent flavour. It is the\r\nfirst to come on the market. It is not consumed in Cyprus, but made\r\nentirely for the Egyptian market, where it is much liked. Being soft, it\r\ndoes not keep well, and should always be kept covered in brine. For\r\nthese reasons it is exported in small barrels of a gross weight of 40 to\r\n50 okes. If care is taken in this respect, if all leaky barrels are kept\r\nrefilled and cool storage provided, it may be preserved for a year; but\r\nthese conditions are rarely fulfilled in Cyprus.\r\n\r\n_Telemés._--This is another soft cheese, prepared in a similar manner to\r\n\"fetta,\" but it is cut into square blocks and placed not in barrels or\r\nvats, but in tins which, when completely filled with cheese and brine,\r\nare soldered down. This cheese is also made entirely for the Egyptian\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n_Kaskaval or Kaskavalli._--This is mostly made by cheese-makers who come\r\nover from Greece or Turkey during the cheese-making season.\r\n\r\nThe curd, after the whey is drained off, is called \"phlongos,\" and it is\r\nalmost always bought from the shepherds, each shepherd preparing it in\r\nhis own way. It is transported in baskets, sometimes a good distance, to\r\nthe cheese factory, or \"kassaria,\" and these drawbacks, added to lack of\r\ncleanliness, are the cause of much cheese of inferior quality being\r\nproduced which has no keeping properties and must be quickly consumed.\r\n\r\nHaving reached a pasty condition, the cheese is placed in reed or willow\r\nbaskets and immersed in either boiling whey or clean water and stirred\r\nuntil the whole mass is transformed into \"kossimari\"; it is then cut\r\ninto pieces weighing one or two okes, and moulded by hand into a\r\nglobular form, leaving one slight depression called the \"omphalos\" or\r\nnavel. If not properly stored, this cheese soon dries and becomes rancid\r\nor tasteless.\r\n\r\n_Agrafa Cheese._--This is made entirely from sheep's milk. Coagulation\r\nshould be completed in 25 to 30 minutes. The cheese remains 20 hours in\r\nthe press. Salting lasts from 40 to 60 days, and the cheeses ripen in\r\nfour months. If well stored, the cheese may keep for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Butter_\r\n\r\nButter making is carried on to only a limited extent in Cyprus, and with\r\ntwo or three exceptions is in the hands of shepherds, who use a\r\nprimitive conical-shaped churn, something after the Danish pattern.\r\nChurning consists in beating up the contents of the churn with a stick,\r\nto the end of which is fixed a round wooden disc 6 to 10 in. in\r\ndiameter, not unlike a piston in its action. Sheep's milk is mostly used\r\nand, with a modern churn, this will yield 9 to 12 per cent. of fresh\r\nbutter. Goats' milk gives about 5 to 6 per cent. About half the above\r\nquantities may be obtained with the older, native churn.\r\n\r\nIn the Near East (Greece, Turkey, etc.) fresh butter is not used in\r\ncooking, as almost all cooked food is fried and butter containing the\r\nleast water and casein cannot serve the purpose. The pure fat must\r\ntherefore be extracted. Two methods are applied. The best is that of\r\nplunging the tins containing the fresh butter into hot water which heats\r\nthe butter and sends the fat to the surface. It is then collected and\r\nslightly salted. This has a good flavour and keeps well.\r\n\r\nThe second method is to place the fresh butter, or the residue from the\r\nformer process, into tin pans and boil until the water is evaporated,\r\nwhen the albuminoids solidify at the bottom of the pans. The fat which\r\nis then on the surface is ladled out. This is inferior in quality, and\r\nhas a disagreeable smell imparted by the albuminoids which come in\r\ncontact with the hot pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Xynogala or Yaourti_\r\n\r\nThe former is the Greek, the latter the Turkish name for this\r\npreparation of sour milk. Unlike fresh butter, it forms, in season,\r\npart of the diet of almost every Cypriot household. It is now made in\r\nEngland and sold as \"Bulgarian milk\" or \"yaourti.\" It is in the form of\r\nclotted cream, but if placed in a bag of fine cloth and if the whey is\r\nleft to drain off, it forms a thick paste, and has an excellent creamy\r\nflavour, and is eaten in both cases either alone or, like Devonshire\r\ncream, with stewed fruits, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trachanas_\r\n\r\nThis is another favourite milk preparation, being a mixture of \"yaourti\"\r\nand ground wheat made into a thick paste. This is sun-dried and makes an\r\nexcellent soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kaimaki or Tsippa_\r\n\r\nThis much resembles Devonshire clotted cream. It is the natural cream\r\nformed after boiling the milk overnight and setting it in shallow pans\r\nto cool. If the boiled milk is poured into the pans from a height, so as\r\nto make a foam, a better result is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. CROPS AND OTHER PRODUCE OF THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREALS\r\n\r\nThe Messaoria plain is the principal corn-producing area of the island.\r\nWheat, barley and oats are the chief cereals grown, and they are sown\r\nmore or less throughout the whole of Cyprus, nearly up to the summit of\r\nTroödos, to an altitude of about 4,500 ft. Indian corn has been\r\ncultivated for ten years or so, and is becoming more general both for\r\ngreen food and for seed, and rye has begun to make its appearance during\r\nthe last few years. Dari is becoming more known.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the land for cereals is as follows: About the middle\r\nof January, when the land is soaked with rain, the fallow field ([Greek:\r\nneasma] or [Greek: neatos]) is broken up, and in some cases sown with a\r\ngreen fallow, and in March or April it is cross ploughed ([Greek:\r\ndibolo]). If the autumn rains are early, the field is ploughed for a\r\nthird time ([Greek: anakomma]), after which the crop is sown; but if the\r\nrains are late, the sowing is done on fields which have been cross\r\nploughed only. As a rule sowing begins after the autumn rains, and may\r\ngo on until January. But if rain does not come before the end of\r\nOctober, many sow before the rain; and in many places farmers sow\r\nregularly before, _i.e._ without waiting for the autumn rains. This\r\nsowing is called [Greek: xerobola]. Lands flooded by a river or other\r\nrunning water are called [Greek: potima] (_Handbook of Cyprus_, p. 154).\r\nThe sowing is done broadcast; the drill is not used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Carting Corn.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--Threshing Corn with Native Threshing Board.]\r\n\r\nOften, owing to want of sufficient hands and shortness of time or other\r\nreasons, land which has been fallowed is sown without being first\r\nploughed up. This is called [Greek: eis to prosôpon], _i.e._ on the\r\nsurface, or face of the field. Again, a field which has had a corn crop\r\nis sown the next autumn without ploughing; and this is locally called\r\n\"on the stubble.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for the same land to be sown year after year with a\r\ncorn crop, with no rotation. This is especially the case with the deep\r\nsoils in the plains, known as \"kambos,\" as contrasted with the shallow,\r\nrocky soils called \"trachonas.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of harvest numbers of labourers, men and women, usually\r\narrive from Anatolia and Syria and find employment in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe threshing-floors are practically identical with those of Biblical\r\ntimes. They are frequently paved with flag-stones, but as often as not\r\nare merely levelled pieces of ground. On these the sheaves are opened\r\nand spread out for the threshing. The threshing-board ([Greek: doukani]\r\nor [Greek: doukanais]) is that referred to by Virgil as _tribulum_\r\n(Georg. Bk. 1) and is merely a stout board, studded on the underside\r\nwith sharp flint stones (see Plate V, fig. 2). This is drawn round and\r\nround over the spread-out sheaves by mules, donkeys or oxen, and affords\r\na pastime to old and young during the summer months. During the process\r\nthe grain is separated from the straw, and the latter is bruised and\r\npartly shredded, and it is the rooted belief of the Cypriot farmer that\r\nonly in that condition will it be relished by and benefit the animals\r\nwhich feed on it. The straw is then gradually cleared away and the grain\r\nis winnowed by being thrown up in the wind with wooden shovels. The\r\ngrain is then heaped up and left until measured by the tithe official.\r\nWith the grain is also collected the sweepings of the threshing-floor,\r\nand the percentage of the foreign substances mixed with the grain varies\r\nfrom 5 to 15 per cent. There are a few winnowing machines and it is\r\nhoped that they will come into more general use as soon as they can be\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nAt Athalassa all cereal crops are reaped and threshed by machinery.\r\n\r\nA good many reaping machines were imported by the Agricultural\r\nDepartment some years ago for resale to the farmers, and there is a very\r\nfair demand. This procedure has not been permitted for some years, and\r\nthe work fell into the hands of an English merchant who has succeeded in\r\nplacing a few machines every year. The country is ready to employ these\r\nand other agricultural machines, but the farmers need guidance in the\r\nchoice of a machine and are reluctant to place orders through native\r\nmerchants, who may not know the best types to supply and whose profits\r\nthey fear to be exorbitant. If they could procure these through the\r\nmedium of the Agricultural Department they would be encouraged to make\r\nconsiderable purchases. The loss of grain on the \"aloni\" alone may be\r\ngauged by the current opinion that each pair of oxen consumes, while\r\nthreshing, one kilé of grain per day. Much damage is often caused by hot\r\nwesterly winds at the time when the grain is just forming.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any law to prevent the adulteration of cereals,\r\ndishonest practices are very frequent. A common method of adulteration\r\nis to mix with the grain the joints of the straw which are cut during\r\nthe process of threshing and separated when winnowing. These are often\r\nsprayed with water in order to increase both bulk and weight. The\r\nmoisture is absorbed by the grain, which thereby swells and is made to\r\nlook bigger.\r\n\r\nUnder the Seed Corn Law of 1898 the Government make advances of seed\r\nwheat, barley, oats and vetches to cultivators under an agreement to\r\nrepay in kind after harvest a quantity of grain equivalent to the amount\r\nof seed so advanced, together with an addition of one-fourth of the\r\nquantity so advanced, by way of interest.\r\n\r\nThis benefit is very generally availed of by smaller cultivators. It has\r\nnot, however, been found possible for Government to keep separately the\r\nvarious kinds and qualities of tithe corn, from which these advances are\r\nmade, and farmers frequently complain that the seed, so issued\r\npromiscuously, is unsuitable to the land, aspect, or special conditions\r\non individual farms. Weevilled grain also is a source of trouble, and\r\nfarmers obtaining such seed advances must be prepared to run risk of\r\nfailure from this cause.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that cultivators often sell their seed corn so\r\nadvanced them, in order to buy some other corn known to them as more\r\nsuited to their land, and they are often justified, perhaps, in so\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nThe issues are made by District Commissioners to selected applicants who\r\nare believed to be unable to buy seed for cash. The average annual\r\nissues, for the last five years, have been: wheat, 38,013 kilés; barley,\r\n31,479 kilés.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wheat_\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, when the population numbered about 1,100,000, the\r\nIsland was said to be self-supporting in the matter of wheat. Taking the\r\nannual consumption of wheat per head of population at 8 bushels\r\n(Gennadius's _Report on the Agriculture of Cyprus_, Part I, p. 8) and\r\nafter making an allowance for seed, the annual production would then\r\nhave been about 10,000,000 bushels. From British Consular Reports it\r\nappears that in 1863 the average produce was reckoned at 640,000\r\nbushels. The average annual production of wheat for the ten years ended\r\n1913, as shown in Blue Book Returns, was 2,292,827 kilés. For later\r\nyears the figures are:\r\n\r\n  Year.              Kilés.\r\n\r\n  1914             1,924,336\r\n  1915             1,761,501\r\n  1916             1,524,484\r\n  1917             1,782,800\r\n  1918             2,424,570\r\n\r\nWheat is sown at the rate of 1 kilé per donum. The average yield per\r\ndonum is 6 to 10 kilés, and varies between 3 to 4 kilés on dry land in a\r\npoor year, to 16 to 20 on the best lands in a good year. When rains are\r\nvery late and spring weather is unfavourable, a farmer often fails to\r\nrecover even the seed.\r\n\r\nMuch might be done to increase the yield by better methods of husbandry,\r\nby the use of improved implements for cultivating and reaping, and by\r\nthe use of threshing machines. An immense quantity of grain is consumed\r\nby birds (larks, sparrows, doves, etc.), which at times literally strip\r\nthe fields and continue their depredations on the threshing-floors.\r\n\r\nWheat is sown from October to December; a field which has had a winter\r\ncrop is pastured after the harvest until January; in January and\r\nFebruary it is broken up and cross ploughed and sown immediately after\r\nwith a spring or summer crop.\r\n\r\nThe crop is cut about May-June. It is cut with a sickle ([Greek:\r\ndrepani]), tied into sheaves, and carried on donkeys or small carts to\r\nthe threshing-floors. The sickle is larger than the European one, and is\r\noften provided with bells (\"koudounia\" or \"sousounaria\") to frighten the\r\nsnakes, and the handles are ornamented with leather tassels.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of wheat are grown in the Island, mostly of the hard\r\nkinds, these being preferred by millers.\r\n\r\nThe following English varieties have been imported and tried during the\r\nlast four years: Improved Treasure, White Stand Up, and Improved Red\r\nFife. The two former failed, being too late in maturing; the latter is\r\nstill under trial, but it is not very attractive, being a late variety,\r\nand it gives a smaller yield than the native kinds. The same remarks\r\napply to several wheats obtained from India and South Africa and which\r\nare still under trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barley_\r\n\r\nThis crop is sown about the same time as wheat, if anything slightly\r\nearlier; and it is ready for the sickle three or four weeks before\r\nwheat. When the straw is short the plant is uprooted, not cut.\r\n\r\nIt is sown at the rate of 1 to 1-1/2 kilés to the donum, and may be\r\nexpected to yield from 10 to 15 kilés; but 30 kilés is not uncommon in\r\nthe plains, and even much larger yields have been recorded from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThere are three native varieties, viz. the common 4-row, the ordinary\r\n6-row and the Paphos 6-row barley, also grown around Davlos in the\r\nnorth-east of the Island. The last-named is heavier than the two former\r\nkinds. Little success has attended the introduction by the Agricultural\r\nDepartment of \"Prize Prolific,\" \"Gold Thorpe\" and \"Chevalier,\" which\r\nhave been experimentally grown for the last three years. They mature\r\nlate and have not resisted severe drought. Their yield is small compared\r\nwith native barleys, although this may improve when they are fully\r\nacclimatised.\r\n\r\nBarley is the staple food for all kinds of animals, pigs and poultry in\r\nCyprus, and it is often used for bread-making in years of wheat\r\nshortage.\r\n\r\nThe tithe is mainly exported to England, where it has a good name for\r\nmalting purposes, especially that produced in the Paphos district. It\r\nhas failed to attain the place it deserves on the English market owing\r\nto the high percentage of dirt, etc., it mostly contains.\r\n\r\nA sample of Cyprus barley examined at the Imperial Institute in 1914\r\nproved to be of good malting quality, and similar material if marketed\r\nin commercial quantities would be readily saleable in the United Kingdom\r\n(see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xii. 1914, p. 552).\r\n\r\nA sample of naked or skinless barley from Cyprus has also been reported\r\non by the Imperial Institute. This type of barley cannot be employed for\r\nmalting for ordinary brewing purposes, but it was considered that the\r\nCyprus material might be used by distillers (who only require a\r\npartially malted barley), and in any case the sample would rank as a\r\ngood class feeding barley (_ibid._ vol. xiv, 1916, p. 159).\r\n\r\nThe average annual production of barley, as shown by the Blue Book\r\nreturns, for the ten years ended 1913 was 2,449,285 kilés. For later\r\nyears the figures are:\r\n\r\n  Year.  Kilés.\r\n\r\n  1914      1,957,944\r\n  1915      1,912,316\r\n  1916      1,953,628\r\n  1917      2,508,880\r\n  1918      3,080,710\r\n\r\nThese figures should be contrasted with British consular estimated\r\naverage in the sixties of 960,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oats_\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus, oats are used on a far smaller scale than barley as food for\r\ncattle, and they are unknown, except to a few townsfolk, as a food for\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this crop is restricted, partly because it ripens\r\nlate and needs late rains, and partly because it sheds its ripe grain\r\ntoo quickly for the ordinary easy-going farmer, who frequently finds his\r\nnext year's crop smothered with self-sown oats. It is also commonly held\r\nthat the crop exhausts the soil.\r\n\r\nThere are two native varieties, both white. The one is grown much more\r\nthan the other, called \"anoyira,\" which, although incomparably superior,\r\nis little cultivated outside the Limassol district.\r\n\r\nThe seed is sown at the rate of 2 to 2-1/2 kilés to the donum, and a\r\nyield of from 20 to 30 kilés is obtained. The average annual production\r\nfor the ten years ended 1913, as shown by Blue Book returns, was 394,695\r\nkilés. For later years the figures are:\r\n\r\n  Year.      Kilés.\r\n  1914      404,917\r\n  1915      378,724\r\n  1916      446,469\r\n  1917      306,010\r\n  1918      313,260\r\n\r\nBesides \"Black Tartar,\" which has been regularly grown at Athalassa for\r\nseveral years, the Agricultural Department has introduced of late years\r\n\"Black Cluster,\" \"White Cluster\" and \"Supreme.\" All these ripen late and\r\nneed late rains, and they have not given any promise of success. A black\r\nvariety imported from Greece some years ago has proved much superior to\r\nthe two native varieties, but its cultivation is still limited.\r\n\r\nReports on oats from Cyprus and on oat, straw and kyko oat plant (_Avena\r\nsativa_ var. _obtusata_) are given in the BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL\r\nINSTITUTE (vol. xv. 1917, pp. 308-10).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rye_\r\n\r\nRye has only lately been introduced by the Agricultural Department, but\r\nalready its cultivation, though very small, is extending. The dark\r\ncolour of the rye loaf creates some prejudice against it, but its value\r\nin cases of diabetes, a common complaint in Cyprus, is greatly in its\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\nThe seed is sown and cultivated here in the same manner as wheat, but at\r\nthe same time or even earlier than barley. It is harvested by being cut\r\nand is threshed on the threshing-floor. The straw is fed to animals, but\r\nwhen threshing machines become more general the long straw will become\r\navailable for other purposes than cattle food, _e.g._ in the manufacture\r\nof the native saddles (\"stratura\"), native straw trays and native straw\r\nhats.\r\n\r\nRye is also grown for green food, in the same way as barley grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maize_ (_Indian Corn_)\r\n\r\nThis crop was first introduced by the Agricultural Department in 1902.\r\nIts cultivation is governed by the water-supply. It is grown mostly for\r\ngreen food, and is met with very generally throughout the Island, being\r\nsown among the growing crops, _e.g._ louvi, sesame, cotton, etc., as a\r\nwind-break or to afford shade. There was a good demand for the grain for\r\ngrinding during the war and the meal is found to be a useful ingredient\r\nin the ordinary loaf. The stems and leaves provide a welcome change of\r\nfood for cattle when exhausted from threshing and during the dry season\r\nof the year. At the Government Farm at Athalassa the stems and leaves\r\nare made into ensilage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dari or Millet_ (_Sorghum vulgare_)\r\n\r\nThis crop is little grown, and is mostly found in the Messaria and also\r\nat Paleochori, almost exclusively in places irrigated by river floods.\r\nThe grain is used for making flour and the fresh stalks are fed to\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS\r\n\r\nCyprus produces a considerable variety of fruits, the chief ones\r\nexported being raisins, pomegranates, oranges and lemons, and grapes.\r\nThere is a considerable and expanding export trade in the fruits\r\nenumerated, as shown by Blue Book returns as under:\r\n\r\n  Year.    £.\r\n\r\n  1904  29,706\r\n  1905  29,265\r\n  1906  41,716\r\n  1907  36,009\r\n  1908  35,027\r\n  1909  29,890\r\n  1910  52,267\r\n  1911  57,393\r\n  1912  59,887\r\n  1913  69,097\r\n\r\nThe pomegranate of Famagusta is famous, and the annual export of this\r\nfruit alone during the five years ended 1913 averaged £14,682.\r\n\r\nAmong the mountain villages apples, pears, and plums are extensively\r\ngrown; the latter specially being in good demand in Egypt.\r\n\r\nApricots and kaisha trees are grown generally throughout the Island, and\r\ntheir fruits are particularly good and plentiful. The last-named is a\r\ndelicious variety with a delicate flavour and externally somewhat\r\nresembles the nectarine. Peaches are mostly grafted on almond stocks, as\r\nthese are hardy and good drought-resisters, but there are a fair number\r\nof European varieties. Almond trees abound in all parts and do extremely\r\nwell if properly cultivated. Other fairly common fruit trees are the\r\nquince and loquat, or Japanese medlar.\r\n\r\nFor several years choice kinds of fruit trees have been imported from\r\nEngland, and many thousands of trees of different kinds throughout the\r\nIsland have been grafted and are now beginning to produce fruit of\r\nexcellent quality. Good work has been done by the Perapedhi Wine\r\nAssociation, whose garden has been a centre for the dissemination of\r\nchoice grafts.\r\n\r\nUnhappily the village growers have been very reluctant to apply proper\r\ncultivation or to carry out advice in treating their trees, which have\r\nbecome the hosts of all kinds of diseases and insect pests. A better\r\nspirit is now being shown in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vines and Wines_\r\n\r\nWriting in 1896, Gennadius described the industry and perseverance of\r\nthe peasants, who with most imperfect implements, by breaking up the\r\nhard rock and building up the scanty soil, formed vineyards on the steep\r\nmountain sides, and often up to their very summits. These vineyards, he\r\nsays, having been mostly planted in haste in the happy days of the\r\ndemand for wines (when French vineyards were destroyed by phylloxera),\r\nwere formed by the personal labour of the peasant eked out by the help\r\nof loans. Since then the wine trade has passed through critical times\r\nand prices have often been greatly depreciated. The small vine-growers,\r\nwho are also for the most part wine-producers, fell on evil times and\r\nbecame heavily indebted. They have remained so until the last year or\r\ntwo, when, owing to the large demand and the high prices of wines in\r\nEgypt, they have been able to free themselves.\r\n\r\nGennadius regarded the cultivation of the vine in Cyprus as indisputably\r\nunprofitable, and was in favour of checking its extension, and even\r\nadvocated the imposition of a special tax on new plantations. At the\r\ntime he wrote there was an overproduction, and the value of wine had\r\ngreatly fallen, and the revenue which Cypriot wine-makers could gain\r\ntherefrom would hardly suffice to cover the expenses of its transport to\r\nthe market, the annual interest on their debts, and the taxes they had\r\nto meet.\r\n\r\nThe village-made wine is usually clarified by means of gypsum. It is\r\ncarried down from the mountain villages in goat-skins (askos or ashia)\r\non pack animals, and then sold to the Limassol merchants, who ship the\r\ngreater part to Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe production of wine as carried out in Cyprus leaves much to be\r\ndesired. M. Mouillefert, who visited Cyprus in 1892 to report on the\r\nwine industry, says: \"The vintage is often gathered too late.\r\nInsufficient care is given to the picking of the grapes and diseased,\r\nrotten, mildewy or unripe grapes are often used which detract from the\r\nquality of the wine.\r\n\r\n\"The grapes are trodden and the fermentation takes place in jars and\r\nchatties of porous earth, of a capacity of 2 or 3 hectolitres, which are\r\ntarred inside to counteract their porosity. The houses in which the\r\nfermentation takes place are of almost the same temperature as the\r\nsurrounding air, with the result that in the warmer parts of the Island\r\nfermentation at first is generally rapid or disturbed, and the\r\ntemperature of the must becomes excessive. In the colder parts, on the\r\ncontrary, the opposite takes place and the resulting wine is rough and\r\nsharp. The use of gypsum as a preservative is unfortunately very common.\r\nThe tarring of the goat-skins and jars imparts a flavour which is very\r\nunsuited to the European taste.\"\r\n\r\nM. Mouillefert made the following recommendations: \"Tarred jars for\r\nfermentation should be replaced by wooden vats, or, in the warmer parts\r\nof the Island, by tuns similar to those used throughout the South of\r\nFrance and in Algeria. Presses less primitive than those in use should\r\nbe employed since these leave in the lees a very large quantity of wine.\r\nThe wine when drawn off from the lees should be kept in tuns or in small\r\nwooden casks.\" \"In short,\" he says, \"to speak quite plainly, no good\r\nwine destined for ordinary consumption can be obtained with jars.\"\r\n\r\nSome twenty years ago an English Wine Company was established at\r\nPerapedhi and, until the war, carried on a successful trade and produced\r\nsome good wines manufactured on modern lines. The factory was well\r\nequipped with up-to-date plant, and its wine of port type was especially\r\npopular. It was throughout the greater part of this time owned by the\r\nfirm of W. H. Chaplin & Co., London, but since the war it has been\r\nclosed down. The excellent brandy of Messrs. Hadji Pavlo & Co. has found\r\nfor some time a steady market in England, and there are other\r\nwell-equipped wine and spirit factories at Limassol, notably those of\r\nthe Limassol Wine & Spirit Co., Ltd., of Mr. M. Michaelides and of Mr.\r\nN. Joannides.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Messrs. Hadji Pavlo & Co. has carried out since 1872 the\r\nmanufacture of spirits, and for twenty-five years they have been engaged\r\nin producing their \"Zanatzin\" brand of wines. Their V.O. cognac and\r\nthree-star brandy are both excellent.\r\n\r\nVarious liqueurs, made from local products, aniseed, kernels of apricots\r\nand other stone fruit, etc., are made by this and other firms, and sold\r\nunder the name \"Zucki.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal wines, spirits, liqueurs and other alcoholic liquors\r\nproduced are:\r\n\r\nThe ordinary black wine of the country, or \"krasi.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary white wine of the country, or \"asprokrasi.\"\r\n\r\nCommandaria.\r\n\r\nBrandy. First and second quality sold in barrels; one-star, two-star,\r\nthree-star and V.O. sold in bottles.\r\n\r\nMastic, sold in four qualities; Zucki, sold in two qualities.\r\n\r\nRum and Amer Pigon.\r\n\r\nAlcohol. 95 C. and 36 C.\r\n\r\nVarious spirits, liqueurs and syrups: whisky, vermuth, amathus, banana,\r\nmentha, mandarini, triantaphyllo, kitro, pergamotto, vanilla, violetta,\r\nanana, benedictine.\r\n\r\nEau de Cologne.\r\n\r\nCommandaria is one of the oldest and most famous sweet dessert wines. It\r\nis held indeed to have been the \"nectar of the gods.\" In the time of the\r\nKnights Templar it acquired great fame. Existing stocks are annually\r\nadded to, the original vintage having in some cases a great age, so much\r\nso that, through evaporation, the wine becomes a syrup or pulp, which\r\nimparts a bouquet to the fresh commandaria which is added to it. In\r\nmaking commandaria the grapes are left on the vines until overripe and,\r\nafter picking, are spread out in the sun for further evaporation, when\r\nthey undergo the usual process of wine-making. In this way a sweet wine,\r\nrich in sugar and alcohol, and having a characteristic flavour, is\r\nproduced. A limited quantity only is made every year, and of this a\r\ncertain quantity is exported and fetches a high price, as a speciality,\r\nin England and on the Continent.\r\n\r\nA red mastic is made at the Kykko Monastery which has acquired local\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nThe situation at the present time is generally improved, and although\r\nCyprus wines can never form more than an insignificant proportion of the\r\nworld's supply, and could not create any special market without\r\nconsiderable change of system and large expenditure in advertising, they\r\nmay yet, by simple improved methods, by means of co-operative storage\r\nand the application of sound elementary principles, be able to secure a\r\nmore recognised position and a remunerative, though perhaps limited,\r\ndemand, at any rate for some of the special brands.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of village producers practical lectures, with the help\r\nof special apparatus, are now being given in the wine villages during\r\nthe vintage season, by officials of the Agricultural Department.\r\n\r\nThe export of wines (including commandaria) and spirits during the ten\r\nyears ended 1913 were of a total value of £313,920 and £55,364\r\nrespectively. The lowest and highest figures were £20,274 in 1909 and\r\n£52,351 in 1911 for wines and £3,991 in 1906 and £8,187 in 1913 for\r\nspirits. For the last four years the exports have been:\r\n\r\n  Year.             Wines (including        Spirits.\r\n                    Commandaria).\r\n                         £                     £\r\n  1914                 29,405                4,396\r\n  1915                 38,158                5,431\r\n  1916                 80,165                6,865\r\n  1917                 78,451               22,173\r\n\r\nThere is an export duty on wine at the rate of 8 paras per gallon, on\r\nall spirit of 20 paras per gallon and on all vinegar of 5 paras per\r\ngallon.\r\n\r\nSome seventeen varieties of _Vitis vinifera_ have for a long time been\r\ngrown in Cyprus; the most largely cultivated being the following:\r\n\r\nMavro (black). The commonest variety, medium-sized bunch, with dark,\r\nlarge, oval-shaped grapes.\r\n\r\nXinisteri (white). Common variety, with medium-sized bunch, white\r\nroundish grapes, thin skin. These are suited to a rich moist soil.\r\n\r\nVoophthalmo (ox-eye). Equally common variety. Rather small bunch, with\r\nblack, round and rather small grapes. Suited to a dry, calcareous soil.\r\n\r\nThe Muscat comes next, being mostly grown at Omodhos. It is the common\r\nearly muscatel of the East.\r\n\r\nThe remaining kinds are locally known as Bastardico (bastard),\r\nMaratheftico or Kraseti, Morokanali or Spourta (flabby-berried), Promari\r\nor Glycopromo (early or early-sweet), Xantho, Axanthi or Phinikoto,\r\nKouphorrhovo or Katin-parmak, Verico, Sultana, Razaki, Corinthiaki\r\n(currant), Malaga (Alexandria Muscatel), Rhodities. Of these, several\r\nare only to be found here and there in private gardens.\r\n\r\nFive years ago several thousand Sultana vines were imported by the\r\nAgricultural Department from Crete, and these have now become fairly\r\nwell distributed over the Island and the produce is beginning to appear\r\nin the market. These dried sultanas in 1918 sold for as much as 4_s._\r\nper oke.\r\n\r\nThree years ago the following varieties of table vines were imported\r\nfrom England by the Agricultural Department:\r\n\r\n  Black Hamburg\r\n  Alicante or Black Tokay\r\n  Canon Hall Muscat\r\n  Lady Hastings\r\n  Royal Muscadine\r\n  Muscat of Alexandria\r\n\r\nThese are now being acclimatised, and it is hoped gradually to\r\ndistribute a large number of grafts.\r\n\r\nVine cultivation covers an area of about 140,000 donums and is in the\r\nhands of some 15,700 vine growers.\r\n\r\nOwing to defects of planting the vines of Cyprus do not in most cases\r\nbegin to bear fruit before the third or fourth year, while, if modern\r\nmethods were adopted, they would bear fruit in their second year and\r\nattain their full growth in their fourth year.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the \"willow-head\" system of pruning has been very\r\ngeneral, with consequently poor results. Better methods have long been\r\ninculcated and are now being more and more adopted. Manuring is but\r\nrarely practised and ploughing is confined to lightly turning the\r\nsurface soil with a wooden plough, and this not every year. On the\r\nhigher slopes of the mountains terracing is common and necessary.\r\n\r\nGrape mildew (_Oidium Tuckeri_) is prevalent in nearly all the vine\r\nareas. Other diseases and pests of the vine met with are anthracnose,\r\npourridié, _Septosporium Fuckelii_, cuscute, _Cochylis_, _Zygæna\r\nampelophaga_ and _Pyralis_. Happily the stringent regulations which for\r\nmany years have been in force prohibiting the importation of any kind of\r\nliving plant have resulted in keeping the Cypriot vineyards free from\r\nthe scourge of phylloxera.\r\n\r\nSulphuring has become more general of late years. The Government has\r\ndone much to bring this about, and for fifteen years or more has\r\nimported sufficient sulphur from Sicily, which has been placed in the\r\nhands of village store-keepers and sold at a fixed price by the\r\nAgricultural Department. This has never more than exceeded the bare cost\r\nand more often has been issued at half cost and in times of distress\r\neven gratis.\r\n\r\nThe vine-owners have been stimulated by the recent high prices for wines\r\nto expend more time and money on this operation. The ignorant prejudice\r\nagainst the effectiveness of sulphur as a cure for grape mildew has to a\r\ngreat extent died out. False ideas of economy alone prevent its general\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nFresh grapes are largely consumed locally, and considerable quantities\r\nare exported to Egypt, as shown by the following table:\r\n\r\n  Year.     Quantity.    Value.\r\n\r\n          _Cwts._     £\r\n\r\n  1904     12,025       1,854\r\n  1905     8,607        1,208\r\n  1906     9,563        1,487\r\n  1907     7,399        1,161\r\n  1908     6,807        1,331\r\n  1909     7,078        1,094\r\n  1910     7,588        1,216\r\n  1911    11,597        1,865\r\n  1912    12,565        2,028\r\n  1913    10,303        1,487\r\n\r\nThe average annual export of raisins for the ten years ended 1913 was\r\n54,007 cwts. valued at £24,190. The lowest price was 5_s._ 4_cp._ per\r\ncwt. in 1909 and the highest 11_s._ 4-1/2_cp._ in 1911. During the war\r\nthe exports have been: 1914, 16,395 cwts., £7,419; 1915, 54,189 cwts.,\r\n£34,467; 1916, 34,361 cwts., £38,188; and 1917, 70,624 cwts., £90,040.\r\nThe annual prices in these years were respectively 9_s._, 12_s._\r\n6-1/2_cp._, 22_s._ 2_cp._ and 25_s._ 4-1/2_cp._ per cwt.\r\n\r\nUp to 1905, inclusive, by far the greatest quantity of raisins had been\r\nshipped every year to Austria; Rumania, Turkey and Egypt coming next in\r\norder. Since that date Rumania has easily taken the first place, being\r\nfollowed at a distance by Austria, Turkey and Egypt. Since the war the\r\nbulk has been shipped for military requirements and to France, Egypt,\r\nMalta and England for eating and for use in confectionery, and the\r\nindustry has grown.\r\n\r\nA marked improvement has taken place in the preparation of the raisins;\r\nand specially qualified officials of the Agricultural Department every\r\nyear give practical instruction on this subject in the vine villages.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Citrus Fruits_\r\n\r\nOranges and lemons are very extensively grown in Cyprus, whilst\r\nmandarines, citrons (\"kitria\") and sweet limes (\"glykolemonia\") are also\r\nfound in every part of the Island. In addition, the shaddock (\"phrappa\")\r\nand the bergamot orange are cultivated in the Island.\r\n\r\nThe best and most common variety of the sweet orange is the oval\r\n(sometimes round) Jaffa, grown everywhere, but specially at Famagusta,\r\nwhere there are numerous orange groves. Another variety of good quality\r\nis grown at Lefka. The trees of both varieties produce large, firm,\r\nthick-fleshed fruit.\r\n\r\nBitter oranges are largely grown from seed for stock on which the better\r\nkinds are grafted. Many thousands of these, and also of the grafted\r\nplants, are annually issued from the Government Nurseries. Much loss has\r\nbeen sustained from time to time through disease, and in 1899 whole\r\norange groves at Famagusta, Lefka and Kythrea were uprooted or cut right\r\nback. With the expansion of the Agricultural Department and a small\r\nqualified staff it has become possible to bring these diseases somewhat\r\nunder control, and the orange and lemon production has much increased,\r\nthough gummosis and scale disease still play much havoc.\r\n\r\nIn the Varosha orange groves the trees are grown in light, sandy soil,\r\nwhich is banked up round the trunk. They are irrigated by means of the\r\nnative alakati, or noria, or more often by air-motors, which in this\r\nlocality are much in vogue.\r\n\r\nThe two most common causes of failure are the persistent planting of\r\ntrees too close together and over-watering. Growers turn a deaf ear to\r\nall advice aimed at changing these two bad habits. The native\r\nagriculturist is convinced, beyond the reach of argument, that the\r\ngreater the number of trees on a given area the greater will be the\r\nprofit. In a land where water is so precious the deep-rooted opinion is\r\nheld that the more water a plant receives the better it will thrive, and\r\ntoo frequent irrigation accounts to a large extent for the widespread\r\ndamage caused by gummosis. Until lately pruning was scarcely practised\r\nat all. Thanks to a system of model orchards lately instituted by the\r\nAgricultural Department, better methods are at last being introduced,\r\nand fruit-growers are able to model their practice upon the work carried\r\nout on the specimen trees, alongside their own, reserved by the\r\nDepartment for such demonstrations.\r\n\r\nLemons are largely consumed by natives with their food. The produce is\r\nof large size, thick-skinned and juicy. Until some twelve years or so\r\nago the fruit was largely sold on the trees for shipment to Russia and\r\nRumania, but those markets failed, owing to the prevalence in Cyprus of\r\nscale disease and partly to loss through rotting in transport. The\r\nexport of oranges and lemons has of late years been confined almost\r\nentirely to Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fig_ (_Ficus Carica_)\r\n\r\nThis tree thrives everywhere, and is particularly cultivated at Livadhia\r\nand Lefkara (Larnaca district), in Paphos and at the Tylliria, where the\r\nsmall, sweet, white variety, locally called \"antelounika,\" is grown.\r\nThere are but few true Smyrna figs, but this variety is being multiplied\r\nby cuttings and also by grafting. Other good kinds are the \"sarilop\" and\r\n\"bardajik,\" of which there are a few private specimens only, and the\r\n\"vardika\" which is more or less common, particularly at Morphou. The\r\nLefkara figs somewhat resemble those of Tylliria and, like the latter,\r\nmature naturally; they are considered very good and are divided into two\r\nvarieties, the \"malantzana\" and the \"kourtziatika.\" The figs of Ktema in\r\nPaphos are the common violet-coloured variety, but are larger, and are\r\nmostly ripened artificially.\r\n\r\nCyprus figs are only of moderate quality, though doubtless susceptible\r\nof improvement. They resist drought and generally yield good crops every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe native dried fig is much eaten, and is also used as an adulterant\r\nof, if not a substitute for, coffee, and makes a good beverage, like the\r\nwell-known Austrian \"feigen café.\" Dried figs are also made into a paste\r\nand mixed with flour to make fig pies (\"sykopitæ\").\r\n\r\nThe method of oiling, that is, smearing with oil the orifice on the top\r\nof the fig while still unripe, is applied to those varieties which ripen\r\nslowly. It is these varieties which are especially grown in Cyprus. The\r\nfruit so treated is rather tasteless and insipid, but as it comes early\r\nto market it fetches a good price. The reason for hastening the ripening\r\nprocess by oiling is that the fruit may become ready for picking before\r\nsparrows and hornets get it, as they would otherwise do at that season.\r\nThe later crop is more or less immune from their attacks, as ripe corn\r\nis then abundant in the field or on the threshing-floor.\r\n\r\nFigs first appear on the market in May. This early fruit is called\r\n\"magiles\" (possibly from Maios-gilia = May production). The fruit is\r\nproduced on the wood of the preceding year, from a bud which has\r\nremained dormant. The next crop appears about mid-July, and then the\r\nfruit is called by its proper name \"syka.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cherries_\r\n\r\nThe principal and almost the only cherry-growing village in the Island\r\nis Pedoulas, in the Marathassa valley. This village is about 3,600 ft.\r\nabove the sea-level. The trees at that village do remarkably well, and\r\nthey bring in a good revenue. They are mostly wild trees which have been\r\ngrafted; but there are also a small number which have been raised from\r\nimported Malaheb seed. From time to time good kinds of young grafted\r\ncherry trees have been imported from England by the Agricultural\r\nDepartment and grafts from these have been freely supplied to the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nThere are two native varieties, one (\"kerasi\") which is almost\r\nexclusively grown at Pedoulas, the other (\"vysino\") which is found\r\nfairly well distributed over the Island. The former is pale yellow and\r\npink, the latter is slightly smaller and less sweet and of a darkish-red\r\ncolour, and is used mostly in making jam and preserves, while the\r\n\"kerasi\" is more for table purposes.\r\n\r\nMore grafted trees are now coming into bearing and \"White-hearts\" are\r\nnow sold in the bazaar at about 12 cps. per oke. \"Black-hearts\" are also\r\nbeginning to make an appearance.\r\n\r\nEfforts are being made to introduce the cherry tree to other hill\r\nvillages, and there seems no reason why its cultivation should not\r\nbecome general in the higher parts of the Island. This fruit travels\r\nwell and a fine market awaits it in Egypt.\r\n\r\nOwing to the prohibition of fruit exports during the war, a small\r\nindustry has grown up for drying the \"kerasi.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Banana_\r\n\r\nThe local name of the banana is Sykiton Adam (Adam's fig), from the\r\nbelief that Adam made an apron of the leaves.\r\n\r\nThere is some hope that the cultivation of this delicious fruit may\r\nbecome more taken up in Cyprus than has hitherto been thought possible.\r\nPaphos has for several years had the reputation of possessing\r\nfruit-yielding trees of good quality. Offshoots from some of these have\r\nbeen transplanted to Larnaca, and there are now several gardens in which\r\na fair quantity of fruit ripens each year. At Kyrenia and Lapithos there\r\nare also a good number of trees. The fruit is of a different variety\r\nfrom that of Paphos and Larnaca, the shape being longitudinally angular,\r\nwhereas the latter kind is longitudinally round and larger.\r\n\r\nFive years ago the Agricultural Department obtained some special\r\nvarieties from Zanzibar. These are now beginning to yield fruit, and\r\noffshoots are being distributed in the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Azarol Hawthorn_\r\n\r\nThis hawthorn (_Cratægus Azarolus_), known locally as \"mosphilia,\" grows\r\nwild scattered about over the country. The fruit makes an excellent\r\njelly. The tree is an excellent stock on which to graft the pear tree.\r\n\r\nIn the higher regions another species, _C. monogyna_, is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Melons_\r\n\r\nThe western end of the Messaoria plain is noted for its water-melons and\r\nsweet-melons. These are grown in \"postania,\" a corruption of the Persian\r\nword \"bustan,\" a garden. They are cultivated only on irrigable land. At\r\nAsha, where, perhaps, the best fruits are grown, the land is flooded by\r\nthe river and no later watering, as a rule, takes place. Through a\r\nwell-grounded fear of theft, the grower and his family live in their\r\n\"postania\" during the season of marketing. Reed shelters are erected,\r\nand the rolled-up beds and bedding with their white coverlets present a\r\nstrange appearance. There is always a big local demand and a good yield\r\nis generally obtained from these \"postania.\" High prices are paid for\r\nsuitable melonland.\r\n\r\nThe local names for the water-melons are \"karpousia\" or \"paticha,\" and\r\nfor the sweet-melons \"piponia\" or \"tamboures.\"\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this fruit is general throughout the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Date Palm_\r\n\r\nThis tree grows promiscuously throughout the plains, produced mostly by\r\naccidental seeding. Very little actual sowing takes place. The best\r\ngroves are round about Nicosia.\r\n\r\nThe trunk-wood, being very hard and fibrous, is used in the construction\r\nof the old type of waterwheel (\"alakati\") and for beams in houses. It is\r\nalso utilised as fuel in Turkish baths as it burns slowly and gives out\r\ngreat heat. Palm leaves are in demand for making various native baskets,\r\nspecially the \"zimpilia\" for holding seed when sowing broadcast. Hats\r\nare made from them in a few villages.\r\n\r\nThe native varieties of date palm are not of high quality. They are:\r\n\"Baltchik,\" the fruit of which ripens on the tree; \"Phountouk\"\r\n(hazelnut); \"Kourmouzou\" (red); and \"Saraih\" (yellow). The last three\r\nare artificially ripened when picked, by spraying them with a mixture of\r\nsyrup and vinegar. The \"Baltchik\" produces fruits suitable for fresh\r\nconsumption. The \"Phountouk\" is somewhat inferior. The other two have\r\nlarge fruits which are specially suited for preserving.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago the Agricultural Department imported from Sudan the\r\nfollowing varieties: \"Condeila,\" \"Bertamouta\" and \"Barakawi.\" They\r\nsuffered much on the journey and it is doubtful if more than two or\r\nthree specimens will survive.\r\n\r\nAs a rule dates ripen well in Cyprus; gathering takes place from October\r\nto December. The clusters must generally be covered with sacking to\r\nprotect them from birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTS\r\n\r\n_Hazelnuts and Cobnuts or Filberts_\r\n\r\nThese nuts are collectively known in commerce as \"small nuts.\" They are\r\nall, however, the produce of a species of _Corylus_, the different kinds\r\nbeing distinguished by trade names according to their country of origin\r\n(see an article on \"Sources of Supply of Hazelnuts\" in BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xiv. 1916, pp. 261-7).\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus these are grown almost exclusively around a well-defined group\r\nof villages of the Pitsillia, notably Alona, Palæchori, Askas,\r\nPlatanistassa, Phterikoudi, Livadhia, Agros, Alithinou, Saranti,\r\nPolystipos. In this locality the plantations are thickly grown and good\r\nyields are obtained. It is doubtful whether there are other parts of the\r\nIsland equally well suited to this tree.\r\n\r\nHazelnuts, besides their use for dessert purposes and in the preparation\r\nof various nut foods, are employed largely as a cheap substitute for\r\nalmonds, and in years when the latter are scarce, hazelnuts are in\r\nespecially good demand.\r\n\r\nThe Cyprus nuts are outwardly of good size and appearance and are very\r\nattractive in the English market, but unfortunately they are usually\r\npicked before reaching full maturity, and consequently the kernels are\r\nfrequently small and soon become rancid. Being gathered when unripe they\r\nlose greatly in weight, which means loss of money to the exporters. The\r\nflavour is also impaired by premature picking and on this account Cyprus\r\nnuts compare unfavourably in this respect with those from Spain, and\r\nTrebizond and other parts on the Black Sea, with which they have to\r\ncompete. If growers would pay more attention to this point, Cyprus\r\nhazelnuts would, owing to their size, hold a much better place than they\r\ndo in the English market.\r\n\r\nThe export of hazelnuts is not separately recorded, but the annual\r\naverage production is stated to be approximately 120,000 okes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walnuts_\r\n\r\nSome fine specimens of walnut trees are to be seen in the Marathassa\r\nvalley and in the neighbourhood of Palæochori, and near mountain streams\r\nin several places among the slopes of the hills. These yield excellent\r\nfruit and are profitable to their owners, but unfortunately many trees\r\nhave succumbed to the attacks of the Codlin moth. Special action has\r\nbeen taken during the last two years to deal with this pest. There has\r\nbeen a marked increase of late in the planting of young walnut trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Almonds_\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this tree has greatly extended of late. Its\r\ndrought-resisting properties enable it to withstand the climate of the\r\nplains and on the level slopes of both ranges it grows well. There are\r\nseveral large plantations, notably at Psevdhas, Larnaca district, where\r\nthe famous Jordan variety is found, and as the tree seems indifferent to\r\nsoil, and thrives particularly well on the limestone which is so general\r\nthroughout the Island, it may be hoped that it will be greatly\r\nmultiplied. Both the soft- and the hard-shelled varieties are grown.\r\nMuch good work has lately been done in School Gardens, under expert\r\nadvice, in germinating the seed in damp sand. The villagers, finding the\r\nseedlings already to hand for planting, have been induced to plant them\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAlmonds are used as stocks on which to graft peaches, kaishas, apricots\r\nand plums (\"mirabelles\").\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spanish Chestnut_\r\n\r\nSome years ago good numbers of the edible chestnut were raised at\r\nPedoulas by the Agricultural Department and distributed to villagers for\r\ngrowing in the hills. It is feared that the greater part of these trees,\r\nthrough want of attention, unsuitability of soil or climate, lack of\r\nmoisture, and especially damage by goats, have been lost, but some\r\nremain and well-grown young trees may be found in certain localities and\r\nin moderate numbers among the mountains. As soon as adequate protection\r\nfrom goats can be given, this tree might be well worth more extensive\r\ncultivation. It prospers well when properly cared for, but will not\r\nthrive in soils containing more than about 3 per cent. of lime or at an\r\nelevation below about 1,000 ft.\r\n\r\nThe tree has been propagated almost entirely from seed, which must be as\r\nfresh as possible. No doubt one reason for the lack of interest hitherto\r\nshown in this tree by villagers is that it does not begin to fruit, as a\r\nrule, until about its twentieth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pistacia_\r\n\r\nSeveral species of _Pistacia_ occur in Cyprus, and although they yield\r\nproducts of different kinds, it will be convenient to deal with them\r\ntogether in the present section.\r\n\r\nThe pistachio nut (_Pistacia vera_), locally called \"Aleppo pistachio,\"\r\nis a native of Persia and Arabia and it was thought, until a few years\r\nago, that it would not thrive in Cyprus. That is, however, a fallacy,\r\nwhich is rather confirmed by the fact that the _P. Terebinthus_ and the\r\n_P. Lentiscus_ are indigenous to the Island. It is considered that the\r\nbest method of cultivation is to bud _P. vera_ on _P. Terebinthus_.\r\nThough they grow more slowly, these budded trees are more robust and\r\nbetter resist drought, cold and moisture. The trees should yield fruit\r\nin five years from the time of grafting. A fair number of these trees\r\nhave now been distributed from the Government Nursery Gardens.\r\n\r\nThis tree provides the pistachio nuts which are now imported from Syria\r\nand Chios.\r\n\r\nMale trees do not usually flower at the same time as female;\r\nconsequently there has been difficulty in getting fruit with seeds, and\r\nrecourse must in that case be had to artificial fertilisation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Palestine or turpentine tree (_P. palæstina_), local name\r\n\"trémithos,\" grows in certain parts of the Island, but is seen at its\r\nbest in the Paphos district, especially in and around the town of Ktima.\r\nThe fruit is eaten fresh or salted and dried. It yields 10 to 15 per\r\ncent. of edible oil which has a certain local demand. A medium-sized\r\ntree may produce up to 60 to 80 okes of fruit. After crushing and\r\nexpression, the residue together with the seed is found to be a good\r\nfood for pigs. A small consignment of both the dried and salted fruit\r\nand of the residue was sold in Egypt in 1916 and realised 5 to 6 cp. per\r\noke for the former, and 3_s._ to 4_s._ per kilé for the latter.\r\n\r\nBy making incisions in the trunks of both the male and the female trees\r\na gum or turpentine known as \"Paphos tar\" is obtained, which fetches as\r\nmuch as 8_s._ to 10_s._ per oke. It is used locally for chewing.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest trees in the Island and is of handsome shape.\r\nIt is deciduous and some fine specimens are met with.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Pistacia Lentiscus_, locally known as shinia, or shinia bush, abounds\r\nall along the coasts of the Island. From the seeds of this shrub an oil\r\nis expressed which is used for culinary purposes, particularly for\r\nfrying fish. The oil is also in good local demand for soap making, and a\r\nvery fair soap is produced, especially at Akanthou, in which the oil is\r\nthe chief ingredient.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of this shrub are largely used for tanning purposes and were\r\nat one time regularly exported to England, though in small quantities.\r\nThe principal market for shinia leaves is Palermo. They are employed to\r\nno small extent for the adulteration of sumach, for which Palermo is\r\nalso the leading market. Shinia leaves were also in demand at Lyons as a\r\ndyeing material for silk stuffs.\r\n\r\nThere are also a few specimens of a variety of _P. Lentiscus_ (mastic\r\ntree) from which in the Island of Chios the famous Chios mastic is\r\nobtained by incisions made in the trunks of the male stocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe terebinth tree (_P. Terebinthus_), locally called \"tremithia,\" is a\r\nbush very widely grown throughout the higher regions. It is used as a\r\nstock on which to graft _P. vera_. The berries are used for extraction\r\nof oil which has a value for culinary purposes. They are also made into\r\na cake called \"tremithopites.\" The berries are much smaller than those\r\nof the _P. palæstina_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of vegetables has considerably extended of late. Good\r\nmarket gardens have existed in and around the principal towns for many\r\nyears, but more attention is now being paid to this industry in the\r\nvillages, wherever water is available, and a considerable amount of\r\nskill is shown in production.\r\n\r\nAmong the best and most generally grown vegetables are spinach,\r\ncauliflowers, cabbages, egg-plants, lady's fingers, leeks, artichokes,\r\nbroad beans (also grown as a field crop), radishes, celery, beet-root,\r\npumpkins, marrows, cucumbers, lettuces, tomatoes, lentils, kohl-rabi\r\n(\"kouloumbra\"), kidney beans (\"phasoulia\"), peas, kolokas, onions and\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable demand in Egypt for fresh vegetables, and to\r\nmeet this the land around the \"ports\" of Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol\r\nhas been for some years specially devoted to their cultivation. In the\r\nmountain valleys a continuous series of small vegetable gardens may be\r\nseen flanking the sides of the river-banks. The exports of vegetables to\r\nEgypt in recent years are given in the following table:\r\n\r\n                              Beans and      Other\r\n  Year.            Onions.      Peas.      Vegetables.\r\n                    _Cwts._       _Cwts._        _Cwts._\r\n  1909              6,664       1,729          49\r\n  1910              3,807         858          60\r\n  1911              5,512       2,346         122\r\n  1912              3,659       2,583         135\r\n  1913              2,854       1,670          32\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beans and Peas_\r\n\r\nBeans are grown for market mainly at Marathassa and Pitsillia and\r\ngenerally in the higher regions, but only to a small extent in the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nBefore the war there was a comparatively large importation of beans from\r\nAnatolia. This having stopped, local prices rose and stimulated\r\nproduction in the Island.\r\n\r\nThe Cypriot is a lover of dried vegetables, and there might well be an\r\nextension in the cultivation of beans, similar to that which has lately\r\ntaken place in the case of green peas. Except in one or two places,\r\nthese were not sown by the villagers until about four years ago, but so\r\nvaluable have they been found, especially in recent years of scarcity\r\nand high cost of other foodstuffs, that now whole districts are being\r\ndevoted to their cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe French or kidney bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) is locally known under\r\nthe general term \"louvia.\" This name is applied both to _Phaseolus\r\nvulgaris_ and to _Dolichos melanophthalmus_ (_Vigna Catjang_ var.\r\n_sinensis_). To distinguish the two kinds the Cypriot describes the _P.\r\nvulgaris_ as \"louvia gliastra\" (_i.e._ lustrous, owing to its shiny\r\nappearance), or \"louvia peratica\" (_i.e._ foreign), as _D.\r\nmelanophthalmus_ was introduced and had become acclimatised some time\r\nbefore. Gennadius, however, describes the \"louvia peratica\" as _Dolichos\r\nLablab_ or lablab bean.\r\n\r\nBoth the dwarf (\"koutsoulia\") and the climbing (\"makrya\" or\r\n\"anarichomena\") varieties of _P. vulgaris_ are grown. There are two\r\nwhite kinds, the large (\"adra\") and the small (\"psintra\").\r\n\r\nBeans of various colours are grown here and there, and one spotted\r\nvariety (\"patsaloudhia\") merits greater attention than it receives at\r\npresent, both on account of its greater productiveness and for its\r\nexcellent flavour. Two of these are stringless, but a drawback to them\r\nis that they discolour the water in which they are boiled.\r\n\r\nThere are several newly imported kinds which are privately grown, and\r\nthese are gradually coming into the local markets.\r\n\r\nThe lubia or cow-pea (_Dolichos melanophthalmus_ = _Vigna Catjang_ var.\r\n_sinensis_), being a good drought-resister, is grown more or less\r\nthroughout the Island. It is frequently sown in mixed crop with cotton,\r\nsesame, Indian corn, etc.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds are cultivated--the larger, \"lubia melissomatia\" (having the\r\neye like a bee), and the smaller, \"lubia mavromatoudhia\" (dark-eyed).\r\n\r\nThe dried pods of _Phaseolus_ and _Dolichos_ are fed to animals and are\r\nalso used for stuffing mattresses.\r\n\r\nThe broad bean (_Vicia Faba_) has been grown for some years on irrigated\r\nland in the plains, where it takes a recognised place in the rotation.\r\nIts cultivation is now spreading to the higher parts.\r\n\r\nThe soy bean was introduced a few years ago by the Agricultural\r\nDepartment, but has failed hitherto to attract attention. Villagers find\r\nit requires different cooking from what they are accustomed to, and\r\nlocal dealers are not yet prepared to deal in it. It has been found\r\nresistant to disease, and further efforts are being made to bring it\r\ninto popular favour.\r\n\r\nThe Ochrus vetch (_Lathyrus Ochrus_), locally known as \"louvana,\" is a\r\nfairly common spring crop, being grown for the sake of the seed which\r\nprovides a favourite Cypriot dish. The leaves are also used as a salad.\r\nThis crop is sown in the plains in January, but in the Karpas and some\r\nother parts it is sown in the autumn.\r\n\r\nChick-peas (_Cicer arietinum_), locally called \"revithia,\" grow well and\r\nare cultivated to a moderate extent. Samples examined at the Imperial\r\nInstitute proved to be of normal composition. Two firms of produce\r\nbrokers in London stated that if quantities of about 5 tons at a time\r\ncould be delivered in England in as good a condition as the sample they\r\ncould be sold for human consumption and would be worth (1917) £20 to £24\r\nper ton c.i.f., United Kingdom ports. If of inferior quality to the\r\nsample they would be fit only for cattle food and fetch considerably\r\nless (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xv. 1917, p. 307).\r\n\r\nChick-peas when roasted are locally called \"koudames\" and are eaten in\r\nthe same way as ground-nuts, which they much resemble in flavour. They\r\nare little, if at all, used in Cyprus as a cattle food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potatoes_\r\n\r\nThe potato-growing industry in Cyprus has developed considerably in\r\nrecent years, as will be seen from the subjoined table of exports:\r\n\r\n  Year.        Quantity.   Value.\r\n                _Cwts._         £\r\n  1909         12,586      3,105\r\n  1910         14,983      3,839\r\n  1911         36,271      8,472\r\n  1912         45,336     10,348\r\n  1913         31,310      7,003\r\n  1914         54,203     11,741\r\n  1915         82,304     28,513\r\n  1916        136,027     74,632\r\n  1917        224,453    101,120\r\n\r\nThese figures, however, are a very inadequate indication of the actual\r\nincrease of production, inasmuch as the local consumption of this\r\nvegetable before the war was confined almost entirely to the well-to-do\r\nresidents in the towns, whereas now it is rapidly becoming a staple food\r\nof the people. This unascertainable but large local consumption must be\r\nadded to the latest export returns in order to arrive at an estimate of\r\npresent production.\r\n\r\nThe most favoured variety was at first, and with many growers still is,\r\nwhat is known as the French potato, the original seed having been\r\nbrought from France. Irish potatoes (locally called \"pittakoura\") have\r\nnow largely displaced these, partly, no doubt, on account of the greater\r\nfacility of obtaining the latter seed during the war.\r\n\r\nA native variety of potato, believed to have been imported by Syrian\r\nArabs in the sixteenth century, is still grown on a small scale in the\r\nMarathassa valley. This potato has deep-set eyes and a luxuriant growth\r\nabove ground and possesses a characteristic sweet taste.\r\n\r\nGreat progress has been made within the last few years in the matter of\r\ncultivation, and the old practice of planting broadcast on the flat has\r\ngiven way to ridge planting at proper distances apart. The practice\r\nformerly was to drop the potatoes into the plough furrow. These were\r\ncovered over by the return plough; every third furrow was sown.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian demand and the purchases made for military purposes have\r\ngreatly stimulated production.\r\n\r\nThe good prices obtained have led, particularly in the Famagusta\r\ndistrict and in what are called the \"red earth\" villages, to much\r\nactivity and no small outlay in the matter of water-supply and\r\ndistribution, and in the use of chemical manures.\r\n\r\nThe custom has grown up for importers to send their seed potatoes for\r\nplanting in the higher parts of the Island. The produce therefrom is\r\nexchanged with growers in the plains, who send up their plain-grown\r\ntubers as seed to the cultivators in the hills. Merchants often\r\nstipulate with the hill-growers that they shall have their crop at an\r\nagreed, and generally a fairly high, figure. In this manner degeneration\r\nof the seed has been retarded; but owing to the difficulty of obtaining\r\nseed from outside during the war a certain amount of degeneration has\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nOnly one crop can be grown in the hills during the year, but in the\r\nplains two crops are obtained. The one is planted in January and is dug\r\nin May-June; the other is planted in July and dug in November. It is\r\nfound that the tubers lifted in the summer suffer greatly from the heat,\r\nand heavy losses occur from rot, whether the tubers remain in the ground\r\nor if they are dug and stored; and it is a question whether, when these\r\nlosses are taken into account, the summer crop is really profitable.\r\n\r\nThe average yield is sometimes put at 2,000 okes per donum, but 1,600\r\nokes, or 2 tons, is probably a more accurate figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kolokas_ (_Colocasia antiquorum_)\r\n\r\nThis is a favourite food of the villager, but can only be grown where\r\nthere is an ample water-supply and on heavy land that holds the water.\r\nIt is an exhausting crop. The root only is eaten. It is sown in\r\nMarch-April and dug about October-November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Onions_\r\n\r\nThese are generally grown, especially in the Paphos district; Famagusta\r\nand Limassol following in the order named. The Paphos onions are\r\nsupposed to have particularly good keeping qualities. Both round\r\n(\"strongyla\") and long varieties (\"tolmalikia\") are grown; the latter\r\nhave less fleshy scales than the former.\r\n\r\nOnions are grown either in irrigated gardens or in \"livadhia,\" or\r\nlow-lying lands which retain their moisture, no irrigation being needed.\r\nThey are propagated by means of \"konari\" or bulblets. Lapithos in the\r\nKyrenia district makes a speciality of producing these from seed and\r\nsupplying them to the whole Island, although onions are grown for market\r\nonly on a limited scale in that area. The method is to plant out the\r\nfull-grown onions (locally called \"mammes\") and leave them to ripen\r\ntheir seed. The seed is sown in February-March, at the rate of 20-25\r\nokes per donum, from which some 3,000 okes of \"konari\" are raised. These\r\nare then sold for planting out in October-November-December at the rate\r\nof 40-50 okes per donum.\r\n\r\nOnions are grown either in rows or broadcast. The native variety has the\r\nouter scales of a reddish colour, but these have largely given way to\r\nsuperior imported kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nFODDERS AND FEEDING STUFFS\r\n\r\n_Carob Tree_\r\n\r\nThe carob (_Ceratonia siliqua_) is indigenous in Syria, and probably\r\nalso in the northern countries of Africa, whence it presumably spread to\r\ncertain parts of Asia Minor, to Greece, the Greek Islands and Southern\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Christ, and for some centuries later, this tree was known\r\nto the Greeks by the name of keronia or keratea, being the Greek for\r\nhorns, and is given to the locust or carob bean from its supposed\r\nresemblance to goats' horns. It is also known in different parts of\r\nCyprus under the following names; teratsia (a corruption of keratea),\r\nxylokeratea, kountouroudia, koutsoupia and charoupia. The last named is\r\nof Arabic origin (kharroub) and the same root of the word is common all\r\nover Europe. Moreover, the fruit varies slightly according to locality,\r\nand develops local characteristics which have acquired for it\r\ndistinctive local names; thus in Kyrenia District we have templiotiké\r\nand kyrionitiké, in the Karpas there is the sarakine (introduced by\r\nSaracens?) and elsewhere the vaklitiké and komboté. This bean or pod,\r\nwhich when ripe is of a chocolate colour, contains from 6 to 10 hard\r\nseeds, embedded in a sweet, pithy, honey-like substance which imparts\r\nthe flavour so much appreciated by animals.\r\n\r\nThe carob tree belongs to the natural order Leguminosæ, sub-order\r\nCaesalpinæ, and is the only species of the genus _Ceratonia_. It is an\r\nevergreen, long-lived tree, growing to a height of 30 ft. and sometimes\r\neven to 50 and 60 ft. It thrives in most kinds of soil, especially in\r\nporous, marly and even volcanic soils, but not in marshy lands. Owing to\r\nits long tap root it resists drought well, and is to be found growing\r\nwell in rocky land such as is common in many of the carob areas of\r\nCyprus. It is very generally found intermixed with the olive tree and up\r\nto about the same altitude.\r\n\r\nA succession of flowers is produced from July to September or October,\r\nand in favourable years up to December and even later, and in\r\nJuly-August the tree bears both flowers and ripe fruit. The collection\r\nof the latter commences about mid-August, the exact date being annually\r\nfixed separately in each district by the Commissioner. This is done in\r\norder to prevent the fruit from being stolen.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations made by the Agricultural Department go to prove\r\nthat the fruit-producing carob tree of Cyprus is really hermaphrodite,\r\nthough there yet remains much room for investigation and the point is\r\nnot finally settled. The others are true male trees. The hermaphrodite\r\ncarob trees which form practically the whole of the fruit-producing\r\ntrees of the Island are cleistogamous (_i.e._ self-fertilised before the\r\ncalyx opens) and short-stamened.\r\n\r\nThere are also certain trees self-produced from seed which are superior\r\nto the ordinary so-called wild tree. These bear fruit which is straight\r\nand short but more or less marketable, and these are known as\r\n\"kountoura\" (short) or \"apostoliki,\" as though sent by chance or by\r\nProvidence. The word \"apostoliki\" is applied in Cyprus to other kinds of\r\ntrees or fruit showing similar phenomena.\r\n\r\nThere are several millions of these trees in the State forests, and yet\r\nmore privately owned. It frequently happens that, owing to the wide\r\npowers of testamentary disposition, a single tree passes by inheritance\r\nto several heirs.\r\n\r\nMany thousands of carob plants are annually raised in the Government\r\ngardens and issued at a trifling charge. The common method of\r\npropagation has been to sow the seeds in pots, and when the plant is\r\nfrom 18 in. to 2 ft. high it is ready for transplanting. The seed, which\r\nis very hard, is softened by placing it in a cauldron or saucepan of\r\ncold water. The water is then brought to the boil. On arriving at\r\nboiling-point the water is cooled and should then be changed and the\r\nseed left to steep for twenty-four hours. Owing to the long tap root,\r\nsowing in ordinary nursery beds has not been satisfactory, as the\r\nplants, which certainly make better growth than in pots, do not\r\ntransplant well.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing methods have to a great extent been superseded by that of\r\ngerminating the seed in damp sand and sowing direct in the field in\r\nproperly prepared holes. Little watering is needed if the holes are deep\r\nand the soil kept friable. A top mulch is useful to conserve the\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nTransplanting from pots or beds is best done when the plants are twelve\r\nmonths old and about 12 in. high, after that it is precarious. Grafting\r\nmay be done as soon as the stem is thick enough to take a graft, either\r\nbefore or after transplanting.\r\n\r\nThe tree is liable to attack by insects and other pests. Scale\r\n(_Aspidiotus ceratoniæ_) is very common; but the greatest damage of late\r\nyears has been caused by the fly _Cecidomyia ceratoniæ_, which lays its\r\neggs on the flowers or newly-set fruit, and the grub feeds on the bean,\r\ncausing it to become stunted and of no commercial value. This stunted\r\ncondition is locally known as \"brachycarpia\" and has been the subject of\r\ncareful scientific study and practical treatment by the Agricultural\r\nDepartment during the last few years. Very satisfactory results have\r\nbeen recorded from the campaigns, which have so far been limited to the\r\nKyrenia District, and these have justified the extension of compulsory\r\ntreatment to other infected areas. This and other pests, such as\r\n_Myelois ceratoniæ_, _Cossus liniperda_ (a lepidopterous boring insect),\r\na species of _Mycetiasis_, and a small hymenopterous fly which has\r\nlately appeared and is now under investigation, have, no doubt, checked\r\nproduction. The attacks of _Cecidomyia_, when serious, reduce the yield\r\nby 80 per cent. or over, and normally may lessen it by 40 to 50 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nMuch damage is also caused by rats (_Mus alexandrinus_), which gnaw the\r\nbark of the branches, causing them to dry up. Their destruction is\r\nencouraged by Government by the payment of 1 cp. per tail.\r\n\r\nCarob gathering commences about mid-August and lasts for about a month.\r\nThe beans are knocked down with long sticks, put into sacks and brought\r\ninto store, or heaped up in the open air, where they often remain for\r\nseveral weeks. This is a safe procedure, as there is little rainfall at\r\nthat season, and what might fall would not harm the beans, which would\r\nquickly dry again.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to estimate the yield per donum of carob trees, but\r\nassuming that the trees were planted 30 ft. apart, and there were 16\r\nmedium-sized trees to the donum, the yield would average somewhere about\r\n1,260 okes to the donum. The yield varies from year to year, a good year\r\ngenerally being followed by a moderate year. The fruit may be destroyed\r\nby frost in January and February, knocked off by hail-stones in March\r\nand April or scorched by hot winds in May or June. A full-sized,\r\nwell-cultivated tree can give up to 720 okes. Taking good and bad years,\r\nthe value of the annual produce of a medium-sized tree is 5_s_.\r\n\r\nCarobs are sold by the Aleppo cantar of 180 okes, and the normal price\r\nmay be put at from 13_s._ to 17_s._ per cantar delivered into store.\r\n\r\nCarobs are weighed on export and the tithe is taken in money from\r\nexporters at the Customs House.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the export of carobs during the ten years\r\nending 1913-14:\r\n\r\n  Year.

Gaudry\r\nmentions that about the middle of last century it was exported to\r\nRussia, Sardinia and Austria. Some is used, in Egypt and the Levant\r\nespecially, as food for the poorer classes and for making sweets and\r\nsherbets. Its chief use in Western Europe is as food for animals, bovine\r\nand equine, for which purpose it is ground up and made into either meal\r\nor cattle cakes. It is also said to be employed in the manufacture of\r\nchocolate and spirit, and there is a demand for the seed for use in the\r\nmanufacture of certain gums.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the bean, \"carob honey,\" locally called \"mavromelos,\"\r\n\"teratsomelo\" or \"betmezi,\" is consumed as a substitute for bee-honey or\r\njam and also as a flavouring for culinary purposes. From the carob honey\r\nis also made the sweetmeat \"pastelli.\"\r\n\r\nAt one time carobs were used in Cyprus for fattening mules and other\r\nanimals, but, unfortunately, this practice died out. Efforts are now\r\nbeing made to revive it, and the advantages of this local product are\r\nagain becoming recognised.\r\n\r\nThe carob contains some 50 per cent. of saccharine matter and the\r\ninteresting question has been raised in recent years as to whether the\r\nbean might not become a new source of sugar production.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lucerne_ (_Medicago sativa_)\r\n\r\nThis plant was introduced about eighteen years ago, but in spite of its\r\nundoubted success when properly grown on suitable soil, the Cypriot\r\nfarmer was for many years very slow to make use of it. Every effort has\r\nbeen made of late years to encourage its cultivation and during the last\r\nthree or four years there has been a steadily increased demand for seed.\r\nIrrigation is necessary in order to obtain a satisfactory yield, but\r\nthere are many farms where it might be grown with great advantage. Its\r\nvalue for cattle food is generally recognised, and now that greater\r\nattention is being given to dairy cattle, lucerne would seem to have an\r\nassured future.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vetch_ (_Vicia Ervilia_)\r\n\r\nThis plant, known locally as \"rovi,\" is undoubtedly the most widely\r\ngrown of the fodder crops. Being a leguminous plant, it has a\r\nrestorative action on the soil, although the average Cypriot farmer\r\nstill considers it to be exhaustive.\r\n\r\nIn the plains sowing begins in January, whereas in the Pitsillia, and\r\neven in the Morphou, Solea and Tylliria districts which are only at the\r\nfoothills, it is sown in October-November, _i.e._ before the cereals.\r\n\r\nRovi is almost the only food in the form of seed given to ploughing oxen\r\nthroughout the East. It is regarded as heat-giving and strengthening,\r\nand is therefore fed specially in winter. It is sometimes given\r\nunthreshed with the straw. It is harvested in May, when it is uprooted,\r\nmade into little bundles, which are stacked together in small heaps in\r\nthe field, until they turn yellow, when they are removed to the native\r\nthreshing-floor and threshed in the customary manner. The dry stems,\r\netc., are eagerly eaten by cattle and sheep. The average yield is very\r\nlittle, from 2 to 4 or 5 kilés per donum. It is subject to tithe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chickling Vetch_ (_Lathyrus sativus_)\r\n\r\nThe chickling vetch, known locally as \"favetta\" or \"chavetta,\" has come\r\nrather more into prominence of late years, displacing the vetch (_Vicia\r\nErvilia_) to some extent, as it gives a heavier yield. It is subject to\r\ntithe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vetch_ (_Vicia sativa_)\r\n\r\nThis crop, called locally \"vicos,\" was introduced from Crete in 1913 and\r\nhas been found excellently suited to this country. It is most useful in\r\nany rotation, and has to some extent supplanted rovi (_Vicia Ervilia_)\r\nas it gives a larger yield. It is a most nutritious cattle food, for\r\nwhich purpose it is grown. When crushed and mixed with chopped straw it\r\nis readily eaten by cattle and sheep. The plant seeds itself very\r\nfreely. It is sown about November-December and is ready for harvesting\r\nin about April. Seed is sown at the rate of 5 to 6 okes per donum and\r\nthe yield is normally from 8 to 12 kilés per donum. It is a good\r\ndrought-resister and needs no irrigation, and being a leguminous plant\r\nshould be cut and not pulled up, as the roots left in the soil serve to\r\nincrease the amount of nitrogenous salts. Being a vetch it is subject to\r\ntithe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tares_ (_Vicia tenuifolia_ var. _stenophylla_)\r\n\r\nThis plant, locally called \"mavracheron\" or \"phakacheron,\" grows wild\r\nin the Pitsillia district among the vineyards and other cultivated as\r\nwell as uncultivated lands. It is of value in those remote localities\r\nwhere grain and straw are little grown and difficult to procure, as it\r\nprovides a wholesome fodder for cattle. The villagers have now taken to\r\ncultivating the plant. It is cut before the seeds are fully matured to\r\nprevent loss of seed through shedding. The seeds and chaff are mixed\r\ntogether when fed to cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milk Vetch_ (_Astragalus_)\r\n\r\nThis plant, locally called \"arkokoutsia,\" grows wild in some abundance\r\namong the hills. When it appears above ground it is readily eaten by\r\nanimals, especially sheep; but at this stage it is apt to cause hoven.\r\nAs the plant hardens the animals do not touch it, except when fully\r\nripe, and then it is greedily eaten.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it blossoms, but before the fruit is set, the plant is\r\ngathered and tied into bundles or small sheaves and stored in a heap.\r\nWhen, after a few months, it is quite dry, and at a time when other\r\nfoods are scarce, it forms an important part of an animal's ration.\r\n\r\nThe plants are sometimes allowed to mature their seeds, and these, after\r\nbeing steeped in water for two or three days to remove acidity, are\r\ngiven to pigs, and are considered a nourishing and palatable food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Moha, Sulla_ (_Hedysarum_)\r\n\r\nThese have been tried for some years with success and are gradually\r\nbecoming known and experimentally grown by farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Teosinte_ (_Reana luxurians_)\r\n\r\nThis grass is one of the most valuable fodder plants with which the New\r\nWorld has enriched the Old. It is a native of Guatemala and is also\r\nlargely grown in Australia.\r\n\r\nSeed was first imported into Cyprus by the Agricultural Department in\r\n1897, and since then the plant has been continuously grown in the\r\nGovernment gardens with marked success. It is sown in March-April in the\r\nsame manner as Indian corn, to which it is allied.\r\n\r\nIf irrigated, three or four cuttings may be obtained during the summer,\r\nyielding 25 to 30 tons of green food per scala. It is greedily eaten by\r\ncattle. Some plants grown by the Department attained a height of 11 ft.\r\n3 in. and of others which were left to ripen their seed, one had 93\r\nstems and weighed 26 okes, though the leaves had begun to shrivel and\r\nhad lost weight.\r\n\r\nThis plant is gradually becoming known and may be found growing on some\r\nof the more progressive farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sudan-grass_\r\n\r\nSeed of this fodder grass was imported in 1915 and very satisfactory\r\ncrops have been obtained each year since then from the experimental\r\nplots. The grass seems well suited to Cyprus and gives a useful yield\r\neven when unirrigated. Occasional irrigation produces a valuable crop.\r\nTrial sowings are now being made on a few private farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Teff-grass_ (_Eragrostis abyssinica_)\r\n\r\nThis has also been tried experimentally with good results and it is\r\nhoped that its cultivation will extend as it becomes more known.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mangold Wurzel_\r\n\r\nThis crop has been grown for several years at the Government Farm,\r\nAthalassa, where it has done well and forms an important part of the\r\ncows' rations. It has been grown successfully on a small scale in some\r\nof the Nursery Gardens.\r\n\r\nAs irrigation, deep ploughing, thorough cultivation of the soil and\r\nspecial cultural operations are needed, this crop cannot be generally\r\nrecommended to farmers, but it is being grown by a few progressive stock\r\nowners under Departmental advice.\r\n\r\nThe wild beet (_Beta vulgaris_) is a native of the seacoasts of\r\nSouth-eastern Europe, and the garden beet-root is much grown in Cyprus\r\nin certain localities, so, if carefully cultivated, mangold wurzel,\r\nwhich is a variety of _B. vulgaris_, might also do well in many parts\r\nand be of great advantage to stock owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prickly Pear_ (_Opuntia_)\r\n\r\nThe prickly pear grows wild as a hedge plant in Cyprus. The fruit is\r\neaten to some extent by villagers, but no attempt has yet been made to\r\nuse the stems as food for animals. In Sicily very large quantities are\r\nso utilised, and now that milch cows are coming more into demand in\r\nCyprus the value of the plant for fodder may become recognised.\r\nSuccessful experiments have been made by the Agricultural Department in\r\nmixing the juice of the stems with lime for giving brilliance and\r\npermanence to ordinary whitewash. There has been an occasional export of\r\nthe fruit to Egypt for consumption by Arabs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPICES\r\n\r\n_Coriander Seed_\r\n\r\nCoriander seed is the product of _Coriandrum sativum_, Linn., an annual\r\nherb belonging to the natural order Umbelliferæ. The \"seed,\" or more\r\nstrictly fruit, of the plant is employed in confectionery in making\r\nbonbons, in the preparation of certain liqueurs and as an ingredient for\r\ndisguising the taste of medicines. In Cyprus it is commonly used as a\r\nflavouring in cooking.\r\n\r\nA sample sent to the Imperial Institute in 1917 was examined as a source\r\nof volatile oil, and the residue remaining after distillation was\r\nanalysed as a feeding-stuff. On steam distillation the ground seed\r\nyielded 0.48 per cent. of an almost colourless volatile oil with the\r\ncharacteristic and pleasant odour of coriander. This yield is below that\r\nfurnished by Russian and German coriander, but is about equal to that\r\nobtained from Morocco seed. The results of the examination indicate\r\nthat the residue has a fairly high feeding-value, and it would be quite\r\nsuitable for the ordinary use of coriander residue, _i.e._ as a cattle\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nA sample of the seeds was submitted to brokers in London, who reported\r\nthat they were very stalky, but that their value would be from 50_s._ to\r\n60_s._ per cwt. (January 1917) as compared with 10_s._ to 15_s._ per\r\ncwt. before the war. (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xv.\r\n1917, p. 301).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aniseed_\r\n\r\nAniseed, the fruit of an umbelliferous herb (_Pimpinella Anisum_,\r\nLinn.), is grown on a comparatively small scale in Cyprus, the exports\r\nin recent years varying from 1,000 to 2,000 cwts. per annum. In 1917,\r\n1,015 cwts., valued at £3,164, were exported, all of which went to\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nSeed sent for examination to the Imperial Institute was reported to\r\nconsist of aniseed in good condition and practically free from\r\nextraneous matter.\r\n\r\nA sample of the seed was submitted to brokers in London, who stated that\r\nat that time (January 1917) stocks of aniseed were quite exhausted, and\r\nthe prices therefore much inflated, small stocks of Spanish aniseed\r\nhaving changed hands in London at 110_s._ per cwt. Such price could not\r\nbe secured if any quantity of aniseed were placed on the market. The\r\nvalue of the Cyprus sample before the war would have been about 27_s._\r\n6_d._ per cwt. (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xv. 1917,\r\np. 300).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite Cumin Seed\r\n\r\nWhite cumin is also an umbelliferous herb (_Cuminum Cyminum_, Linn.); an\r\naccount of the cultivation and uses of this and other spices is given in\r\nthe BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xi. 1913, pp. 131-136.\r\n\r\nA sample of the seed sent to the Imperial Institute was submitted to\r\nbrokers in London, who stated that it was rather small and stalky, but\r\nthat it would probably be worth between 70_s._ and 80_s._ per cwt.\r\n(January 1917), although they were of opinion that its pre-war value\r\nwould not have been much over 20_s._ per cwt. (see BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xv. 1917, p. 302).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Black Cumin Seed_\r\n\r\nThese seeds, sometimes known as fennel-flower seeds, are the product of\r\n_Nigella sativa_, Linn. (Nat. Ord. Ranunculaceæ). The plant is an\r\nannual, native to the Mediterranean region, and the seeds, which are\r\nused in the East for flavouring curries, etc., and in Egypt as comfits\r\non cakes, have an aromatic fennel-like odour when fresh and a slightly\r\nacrid taste. There is a small export of black cumin seed from Cyprus.\r\nThere is, however, but little demand for this seed (see BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xv. 1917, p. 304).\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL OILS AND PERFUMES\r\n\r\n_Origanum Oil_\r\n\r\nDifferent opinions have been held as to the botanical identification of\r\nthe plant from which the Cyprus origanum oil is produced. An interesting\r\nseries of articles on this subject by E. M. Holmes appears in the\r\n_Perfumery and Essential Oil Record_, 1913, from which it would seem\r\nthat this oil is derived from _Origanum majoranoides_, Wild.; while Dr.\r\nStapf, of Kew, regards the plant as _O. dubium_, Boiss. (see BULLETIN OF\r\nTHE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xi. 1913, p. 50). Other varieties growing\r\nwild in Cyprus are _O. Onites_, _O. hirtum_, both of which are locally\r\ncalled \"rigani,\" _O. Bevani_ (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE,\r\nvol. xv. 1917, p. 305) and _O. majorana_.\r\n\r\nIn its wild state the plant from which origanum oil is distilled is a\r\nsmall perennial shrub, but, if cultivated, its size may be doubled or\r\neven trebled. The first crop, consisting of shoots and flowers, may give\r\nfrom 300 to 500 okes per donum; in subsequent years up to 1,000-1,500\r\nokes per donum. The latter quantity would produce 40 to 60 okes of\r\noriganum oil, which is largely used in England for perfuming soap and\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years the distillation of origanum oil has been made under\r\nGovernment control. The industry was started in 1899 and, though not\r\nlarge, has steadily grown. It has been found that the Cyprus origanum\r\noil is exceptionally rich in carvacrol (over 80 per cent.), a powerful\r\nantiseptic, and to this substance the oil owes mainly its characteristic\r\nthyme-like odour. Frequent analyses have shown that the Cyprus origanum\r\noil is remarkably constant in character.\r\n\r\nThis oil has the slight disadvantage of darkening considerably on\r\nexposure to light and air, which renders it unsuitable for use in\r\nlight-coloured soaps, but a method has been worked out at the Imperial\r\nInstitute of refining the oil so as to yield a product which will remain\r\npractically colourless for long periods.\r\n\r\nA report furnished by the Imperial Institute (BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL\r\nINSTITUTE, vol. iv. 1906, p. 299), after giving a detailed description\r\nof the oil, states:\r\n\r\n\"The foregoing results show that this oil sells readily in this country\r\nat prices which should be fairly remunerative to producers in Cyprus. It\r\nshould, however, be borne in mind that the demand for this oil is\r\nsomewhat limited, and that it competes with the thyme oil produced in\r\nFrance and Spain, and with the 'origanum oil' produced in Smyrna, and\r\nthat consequently a sudden increase in production in Cyprus might lead\r\nto a considerable fall in price. The Cyprus oil has, however, the\r\nadvantage that it is very rich in the odorous and antiseptic constituent\r\ncarvacrol, and it is probably due to its richness in this constituent,\r\nas revealed by the analyses made at the Imperial Institute, that the\r\ncomparatively high prices realised for these consignments were obtained\r\nat a time when 'red thyme oils' were selling at lower rates. It would be\r\nadvantageous if a refined white oil could be prepared by some simple\r\nmethod from this material, as this probably would fetch an enhanced\r\nprice, and be applicable to other purposes for which the 'red oil' is\r\nunsuitable.\"\r\n\r\nUntil 1910 the distillation was made by the Department, but since then\r\nit has been undertaken by private contract, permission being given to\r\ncollect the wild plant from the forest. The annual production is now\r\nabout 2,750 lb., and the price has steadily risen from about 3_s._ per\r\nlb. to 8_s._ 6_d._ per lb. at the present time. But whereas the cost of\r\ntransport to London before the war was £8 per ton, it has risen to the\r\nprohibitive rate of £200 per ton, and the 1917 oil still remains in\r\nstore at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe supply of the wild plant is limited and its cultivation is under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the exports of origanum _oil_ in recent years:\r\n\r\n  Year.

It is distilled from a plant which is abundant in the forests of\r\nKyrenia and Paphos, and which has been referred by Dr. Stapf to _O.\r\nmajoranoides_, Wild., and by Mr. Holmes to _O. Maru_, Linn. The market\r\nis, however, restricted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laurel Oil_\r\n\r\nSamples of oil distilled from the leaves of _Laurus nobilis_ which were\r\nexamined at the Imperial Institute were found to have an aroma inferior\r\nto that of the oils usually met with in commerce (see BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xi. 1913, p. 430). The demand for the oil is\r\nsaid to be small.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Otto of Roses_\r\n\r\nThis has been prepared since 1897 in a very small way with native stills\r\nat the village of Milikouri, where the Damask rose is abundant. The\r\ncultivation of this rose has now spread to other hill villages. The\r\nclosing of the market for Bulgarian otto of roses owing to the war has\r\ngiven an impetus to the industry in Cyprus. The Agricultural Department\r\nhas for two years sent qualified officers to superintend the work at\r\nMilikouri and to carry out an experimental distillation.\r\n\r\nA report from the Director, Imperial Institute, upon samples of the 1917\r\ndistillation states that \"the constants of the Cyprus oil agree closely\r\nwith those recorded for Bulgarian otto of roses.\" It was found that the\r\nodour of the Cyprus oil was fairly good, but rather weak. The otto sold\r\nat 70_s._ per ounce, less 2-1/2 per cent., which \"in view of the very\r\nsmall quantity must be considered satisfactory.\" At the time of sale\r\nFrench otto was quoted at 78_s._ to 85_s._ per ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acacia Farnesiana_\r\n\r\nThis tree is but sparsely represented in Cyprus, but wherever found it\r\nis vigorous and healthy. It belongs to the Mimosa tribe of the order\r\nLeguminosæ and, as other species are common in the Island and thrive\r\nremarkably well, there would seem no reason why this species also should\r\nnot become more general.\r\n\r\nIt is known elsewhere under different names; that of \"sweet briar\" (in\r\nBarbados) on account of its numerous thorns and the exquisite scent of\r\nits flowers, and \"stinking cossie\" (in Antigua) owing to the highly\r\ndisagreeable smell of its wood. The word \"cossie\" may be a corruption of\r\nacacia.\r\n\r\nIts flowers are largely used in perfumery, and the annual crop of the\r\nflowers of this plant in France is stated to be worth thousands of\r\nfrancs, and a particularly delicate fragrant perfume is extracted from\r\nthem. The pods are said to yield a fair amount of tannin, while from the\r\ncracks in the bark of the trunk and branches there exudes a gum very\r\nlike the true gum arabic and is utilised for the same purpose. The wood\r\nmakes good charcoal.\r\n\r\nIt is locally known as \"skouroupathos\" or \"skouroupathia,\" and is\r\nclosely allied to the extremely common weed of that name which is found\r\nabundantly in nearly every field in the plains during summer, but which,\r\nowing to its deep-rooted system, the natives do not trouble to\r\neradicate. It is also allied to _Prosopis juliflora_ or algaroba tree,\r\nof which there are a few specimens in the Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nOILS AND OIL SEEDS\r\n\r\n_Olives_\r\n\r\nThe olive tree grows wild in Cyprus, but the wild fruit is small and\r\nbitter and yields an inferior oil. The cultivated trees are those which\r\nhave been grafted. Owing to the stringent regulations which have\r\nprohibited the introduction of living plants from abroad, it has not\r\nbeen possible to obtain from elsewhere good grafts of new varieties.\r\nThese regulations have lately been modified to allow of importations by\r\nthe Agricultural Department under special restrictions, and now that the\r\nwar has ended it is hoped to obtain these much-needed olive grafts.\r\n\r\nThis tree thrives well, almost all over the Island, up to an altitude of\r\nabout 2,300 ft., and numbers of vigorous wild olive trees are to be met\r\nwith, which only need cleaning and grafting in order to bear fruit.\r\n\r\nCyprus olives are divided into two classes, locally known as (_a_)\r\n\"adrouppes\" or \"drouppes,\" which are eaten in the green or black stage,\r\nand (_b_) \"ladoelies,\" which are suitable both for eating and for oil\r\nextraction.\r\n\r\nOf the former, or \"adrouppes,\" one kind is rather large, with rough\r\nskin, having a rough, big stone, the other is longer but of less\r\ndiameter, and has a very thin, smooth skin and the stone is smooth,\r\ncurved and smaller. The latter has a better taste and resembles the\r\nwell-known Greek olive of Calamata. Both these \"adrouppes\" are prepared\r\nfor the table while still green, and are known as \"kolymbates,\" or\r\nsometimes they are called \"tsakkistes,\" owing to the stone being\r\nslightly crushed in the process of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe \"ladoelies\" are of two distinct varieties, the larger of which is\r\nmostly regarded as an edible olive, and contains a less percentage of\r\noil, while the other, or smaller kind, is richer in oil contents, and is\r\nmainly used for oil production, though it is sometimes eaten.\r\n\r\nA few imported varieties, including one or two specimens of Spanish and\r\nGreek olive trees, are to be found here and there in private gardens.\r\n\r\nIf the land were manured and ploughed the trees would, especially on the\r\nchalky soils, yield abundant fruit and oil of excellent quality.\r\nUnfortunately this is not done, and it has been found very difficult to\r\ninduce the peasants to adopt any kind of cultivation. They plough the\r\nland only when they intend to sow corn or other crops between the trees,\r\na procedure which tends to lessen the productiveness of the trees. The\r\nsystem of irrigation applied is also very defective. Irrigation, while\r\nimproving the quality and quantity of edible olives, is not desirable in\r\nthe case of press olives.\r\n\r\nAs to pruning, Cypriots would have none of it until within the last five\r\nyears. By dint of patient and constant persuasion, some few of the\r\nlarger owners were induced to let their trees be pruned by a staff of\r\npruners under the direction of the Agricultural Department (see Plate\r\nVI). Much ridicule--and at times threats--was hurled at both the pruners\r\nand the tree owners, who were assured by the villagers that for their\r\nfolly they would undoubtedly lose their trees. The results belied all\r\nthese fears, and now within the space of some four to five years the\r\npractice of pruning has become fairly general, and a good number of\r\nvillagers have qualified themselves as expert pruners and are kept\r\nregularly employed by private persons. As a consequence of this a great\r\namelioration is noticeable in the olive trees in many parts and the\r\nyield and quality of olives have been improved.\r\n\r\nThe method of gathering olives by beating, however, continues. The fruit\r\nso knocked to the ground becomes dirty and bruised, and quickly\r\nferments, when stored, to the detriment of the oil. This mode of\r\ngathering by beating damages the young twigs and branches, whose bearing\r\ncapacity the following year is thus impaired.\r\n\r\nLittle care is taken in selecting the olives for oil. Not only are they\r\ndirty and bruised, but unripe or diseased fruit, as well as overripe\r\nfruit that has fallen from the tree, is collected together\r\nindiscriminately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nPruned Olive-trees at Metochi of Kykos.]\r\n\r\nThe usual practice is to spread out the olives as received, and\r\nunsalted, on the mud roofs of houses in order to give off a part of\r\ntheir water before grinding.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is then as follows:\r\n\r\nThey are first of all taken to the crusher or grinding mill. This\r\nconsists not of two stones, as in Greece, but of one stone, drawn by\r\npony, mule or donkey.\r\n\r\nFor the first quality of oil the olive stones should not be broken, but\r\ngenerally speaking, insufficient care is paid to this and the stones\r\nare, for the most part, crushed. The crushed olives (zimari, paste) are\r\nthen removed to the press, which is worked by hand, with one exception\r\nof an hydraulic press at Akanthou. At this village, where the best olive\r\noil is produced, the olives are brought direct from the trees to the\r\nmill, whereas elsewhere the practice is to leave them in a heap to\r\nferment and they often become foul and covered with dust and dirt.\r\n\r\nIn pressing with wooden presses, the zimari or crushed olives are placed\r\nin round bags made of plaited rushes. Seven to ten of these are placed\r\none on top of another in the press and the oil obtained is virgin oil\r\n(huile vierge).\r\n\r\nThe bags are then removed and squeezed so as to change the position of\r\nthe contents. They are then replaced in the press and hot water is\r\npoured into each bag. The oil obtained is of second quality. A third\r\npressing is sometimes given.\r\n\r\nThe yield is calculated at the rate of 1 oke of oil to 4 okes of olives.\r\n\r\nIn the Paphos district is produced a black oil with a very distinct\r\nflavour. This is due to the custom of boiling the olives before\r\ngrinding. The demand for this inferior oil is confined to that district.\r\n\r\nIn former days it was usual for the mills and presses to be worked in\r\nthe open. This is now rarely the case, but may still be occasionally\r\nseen in parts of the Paphos district and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhether outdoors or indoors these mills and presses are soon allowed to\r\nbecome very unclean, and the rancid flavour which clings to the wood is\r\nquickly imparted to the oil, which possesses, for any but Cypriots, a\r\nstrong and unpleasant smell and flavour. There is a considerable\r\nresidue or waste, which, if it could be utilised, would go far to meet\r\nthe deficiency in the requirements for local consumption.\r\n\r\nThere are a few good iron presses now in use. Their superiority is\r\ngenerally recognised and, no doubt, now that the war is over, they will\r\nbe imported in greater numbers.\r\n\r\nSmall inexpensive, cottage filters have been designed by the\r\nAgricultural Department and these are being adopted, though very\r\ngradually. The oil so filtered is greatly superior, but having acquired\r\na more delicate flavour, it is not so much appreciated by the native\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of young wild olive trees are issued on permit from the\r\nState forests for private cultivation and many thousands of two- and\r\nthree-year-old plants raised in the Government Nurseries are also\r\ndistributed every year. With the gradual improvement in cultivation and\r\nin the preparation of the oil, the production should increase\r\nenormously.\r\n\r\nThe local production of olive oil is insufficient for the requirements\r\nof the Island, but there is no reason why, in the course of time, when\r\nthe large number of trees newly planted and annually on the increase,\r\ncome into bearing, a valuable export trade should not result. The\r\nfigures of production, given in the table below, are strikingly\r\nfluctuating, and indicate the irregularity of the annual yield and the\r\nmarked variation in price:\r\n\r\n  Year.

It is one of the recognised summer crops\r\nin the plains, and is frequently sown together in the same field with\r\ncotton, maize, etc., and in the vine villages it is sown in the newly\r\nplanted vineyards, where it does well. In such cases the preparation of\r\nthe soil is done on the same lines as for cotton, maize, vines, etc.\r\n\r\nThe seed is used mainly for the extraction of the oil, which is largely\r\nemployed in cooking, and it is also used in the preparation of\r\nsweetmeats; it is added sometimes as a condiment in bread-making. There\r\nis a small export, principally through Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of oil extracted varies according to the locality where\r\nthe seed has been produced. Of the local product, that from Paphos gives\r\nthe highest yield, viz. 30 to 35 per cent.; but this is inferior to the\r\nEgyptian product, which is to some extent imported and yields 40 to 45\r\nper cent. of oil, this being probably due to the thinner skin. The crop\r\nis uncertain. The plant is readily affected by the hot west wind\r\n([Greek: libas]) which not infrequently blows during its period of\r\ngrowth. The development of the seed is thereby checked and it remains\r\nthin and small ([Greek: psalios]), and naturally the oil yield is\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ground Nut, Peanut or Monkey Nut_ (_Arachis hypogæa_)\r\n\r\nThis nut is fairly popular among all classes and is imported through\r\nEgypt in moderate quantities. There is no reason why in certain\r\nlocalities this plant should not be grown successfully, more especially\r\nin the light sandy soils around Varosha and at Syrianochori. Efforts\r\nhave been made to induce cultivators to grow this crop, but so far it\r\nhas not commended itself. It calls for something a little out of the\r\nordinary in the way of cultivation, as the plants mature their fruits\r\nunder the soil; the profit to be derived from the crop is uncertain, and\r\nis thought, though without sufficient proof, to compare unfavourably\r\nwith rival crops. Growers have been somewhat deterred by the ease with\r\nwhich the fruit can be stolen. As this is hidden under the soil, a theft\r\nis not at once detected. These drawbacks probably explain its restricted\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nShould oil-extracting machinery be introduced, these nuts might well be\r\ngrown for their oil, both for culinary purposes and for use in\r\nsoap-making. The residuum, after extraction of the oil, and the haulm\r\nare nutritious cattle foods.\r\n\r\nThe importation of these nuts was recently prohibited except in a\r\nroasted condition, owing to the risk of their introducing plant pests\r\nwhen in the raw, earth-encrusted condition. This has tended to check\r\nimportation, and may perhaps give an impetus to local production. Ground\r\nnuts can be grown, of course, only where irrigation is possible.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of ground nuts imported in 1917 was 1,532 cwts., valued at\r\n_£_2,448. Previous to that year they were not separately enumerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Castor-oil Seed_\r\n\r\nThe castor-oil plant (_Ricinus communis_) is only grown to a small\r\nextent, but the tree usually thrives well and its cultivation might be\r\nextended with advantage. According to Gennadius, Dioscorides claimed\r\nthat it used to be called Seseli of Cyprus, from which the inference may\r\nbe drawn that the plant has long been among the flora of the Island,\r\nwhere it is now known as a perennial. It grows very freely from seed and\r\nrapidly attains a height of 15 or 16 ft.; but it quickly dies back after\r\na slight frost, though it recovers again the following year. It appears\r\nto do well in most soils, but thrives best in light loam with moderate\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\nOwing to the demand for the oil, one or two plantations have lately been\r\nmade by the Agricultural Department.\r\n\r\nThe varieties locally grown include plants producing large, medium and\r\nsmall-sized seed. Trial cultivations are being made to ascertain their\r\nrelative values. It is found that a heavier yield of better quality is\r\nusually obtained where the plant is treated as an annual and not as a\r\nperennial. Four samples of castor seed examined at the Imperial\r\nInstitute were found to contain normal amounts of oil, and similar seed\r\nwould be readily saleable in the United Kingdom if offered in commercial\r\nquantities (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xvii. 1919, p.\r\n492).\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBRES\r\n\r\n_Cotton_\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the Venetian occupation (1489-1570) Cyprus exported\r\nannually from seven to fifteen million pounds of raw cotton. In the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries the English Levant Company sent\r\nlarge quantities from Cyprus to England. When the scarcity of cotton\r\noccasioned by the American Civil War gave a stimulus to its growth\r\nCyprus took part in meeting the demand, and in 1866 over 2,000,000 lb.\r\nwere exported. Since then the production has declined. In former times,\r\nthen, the production of Cyprus cotton must have been very large, as\r\ncotton manufactures in the Island were, as in most cotton-producing\r\ncountries in the East at that period, both considerable and of choice\r\nquality. Cyprus was always distinguished for its cotton spinning.\r\nGennadius suggests that the Karpas, which is one of the centres of the\r\nCyprus cotton manufacture, derived its name from the ancient \"karpasos,\"\r\na fine cotton cloth which came from India. There is an old Hebrew word\r\n\"karpas\" found in the Old Testament, and derived from the Sanscrit\r\n\"karpasa,\" cotton, or \"karpasum,\" cotton cloth.\r\n\r\nDuring the Turkish Administration cotton cultivation declined, owing to\r\nthe destruction of aqueducts, Venetian wells, etc., and to the practice\r\nof taxing the cotton crop in the field before it was picked--a cause of\r\nconsiderable delay and detriment to the crop. Careless cultivation and\r\nconsequent deterioration of the fibre as well as the general fall in\r\nvalue contributed to the decay of the industry. Taxing the crop in the\r\nfield was abandoned in 1890, and a tithe was levied on exported cotton\r\nonly (_Handbook of Cyprus_).\r\n\r\nThe species of cotton principally cultivated in the Island is _Gossypium\r\nherbaceum_. American \"New Orleans\" seed was introduced some twenty years\r\nor so ago, and this has now largely displaced the original native kind;\r\nin fact the native kind has almost entirely disappeared, and what little\r\nis grown is mostly used for stuffing the native bed-quilt or \"paploma.\"\r\n\r\nCotton grown without irrigation is known as \"dry\" cotton. It is grown\r\nchiefly in the Messaorian plain and in the Karpas; it is harsh to the\r\ntouch and short in staple, but of satisfactory colour. \"Wet\" cotton is\r\ngrown on irrigated land; it is usually of larger staple and of finer\r\nquality than the \"dry\" cotton and commands a higher price. This is grown\r\nmainly round about Kythrea, Nisou, Dali, Lapithos and in the Solea\r\nvalley. Native cotton is always grown \"dry\"; the ordinary American\r\nvariety is grown both \"wet\" and \"dry.\"\r\n\r\nThe Karpas cotton, which is \"dry\" grown, is inferior not only on account\r\nof its shorter staple, but on account of the method of picking. In some\r\nplaces of Messaoria, at Dali, Nisou, etc., the \"dry\" and sometimes the\r\n\"wet\" cotton is picked in the morning before the dew has quite\r\nevaporated, and it is picked direct from the growing plant. But the most\r\ngeneral practice is for the villagers to cut the bolls early in the\r\nmorning before the dew is evaporated ([Greek: pornê]), transport them to\r\nthe houses and then remove the lint at their leisure. In this way the\r\nbolls are more or less crushed and the lint when removed contains a\r\nmixture of husk, leaves, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the case of native and other varieties the lint of which adheres to\r\nthe boll, the husks, leaves, etc., are removed from the bolls in the\r\nfollowing way: The bolls are spread out on mats to dry in the sun; when\r\nsufficiently dry the bolls are put in a rotary sieve made of reeds and\r\nsticks, similar in make to the ordinary reed baskets of the country.\r\nEach end of the sieve is closed, but it has an opening in the middle,\r\nabout 1 by 1-1/2 to 2 ft., which is closed by a small reed mat. The\r\nsieve is about 5 to 6 ft. long and 2 to 2-1/2 ft. in diameter. The bolls\r\nare dropped into the sieve through the opening and it is then revolved\r\nby hand by means of an axle which passes through it longitudinally. By\r\nthis means most of the crushed husks and leaves fall through the\r\ninterstices of the sieve.\r\n\r\nThe native seed is usually grown on dry lands as it withstands drought.\r\nThe \"wet\" cotton is mostly of the American variety.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wyndham Dunstan, F.R.S., in his _Report on the Agricultural\r\nResources of Cyprus_ (1905), referred to the successful trials made with\r\n\"Sea Island,\" \"Peterkin,\" \"Truitt's Big Boll,\" \"Culpepper Big Boll,\"\r\nand \"Allen's Long Staple.\" Since then other varieties have been tried by\r\nthe Agricultural Department, and while \"Allen's\" and \"Truitt's\" have\r\ncontinued to do well, good results have been obtained from \"Triumph\" and\r\n\"Durango,\" both of which are early kinds and are therefore very suitable\r\nto the Island. A report by the Imperial Institute on samples of \"Allen's\r\nImproved,\" \"Mebane's Early Triumph\" and \"Sakellaridis\" cottons grown\r\nexperimentally in Cyprus in 1915 will be found in the BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE (vol. xv. 1917, p. 298).\r\n\r\nOwing to fear of locusts, late sowing (about May-June) became rather\r\ngeneral. This is a dangerous practice as the bolls ripen late and much\r\ncotton is spoilt by the early autumn rains. It is mostly sown broadcast\r\nor in trenches; on irrigated land it is mostly sown in the ridges, but\r\nthe older practice of sowing broadcast still, unfortunately, continues.\r\n\r\n\"Dry\" cotton is usually sown either on land which can be irrigated by a\r\nriver when in flood, or in \"livadhia\" or low-lying lands which retain\r\ntheir moisture a long time. In the former case the seed is sown about\r\nMarch-April, while the soil is still damp from rain water or from river\r\noverflow. It is generally expected that when the young plants are fairly\r\nestablished a second irrigation from flood-water may occur. In the\r\n\"livadhia\" the seed is sown later. \"Wet\" cotton is watered about every\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nThe crop begins to be collected in mid-September and continues up till\r\nthe end of October. \"Dry\" cotton is rarely manured; \"wet\" cotton\r\noccasionally. The use of chemical manures is coming into practice. There\r\nare several ginning machines in the Island, but baling by hydraulic\r\npresses is done almost exclusively at Larnaca.\r\n\r\nIn the Island the cotton seed is used for sowing and for feeding cattle.\r\nThe exports of cotton seed have been:\r\n\r\n  Year.

The first quality is the \"wet\" or\r\nirrigated cotton. The second quality is grown mostly in the Messaoria\r\nplain and at Dali, Nisou, Potamia, Kythrea, where it is partly irrigated\r\nby river floods. The third quality is \"dry\" and comes principally from\r\nthe Karpas. On the Marseilles market the second quality has a value 3 to\r\n4 per cent., and the third quality 8 to 10 per cent. less than the first\r\nquality. The first quality ranks in price at Marseilles on about a level\r\nwith American cotton.\r\n\r\nFor some ten years Greece has taken the leading place as an importer.\r\nBefore the war, Cyprus cotton went chiefly to Marseilles and Greece,\r\nsome also to Trieste. Only a very insignificant quantity goes to\r\nEngland. The freight to Marseilles was about 25_s._ per ton, to Trieste\r\nabout 15_s._ per ton, while to England it averaged 50_s._ per ton. The\r\nmarket prices at Marseilles and Trieste were approximately the same, but\r\nat Marseilles they were subject to a discount of 1-1/2 per cent.,\r\nwhereas at Trieste a discount of 3 to 4 per cent. was made. The Trieste\r\nmarket, being small, was subject to sudden fluctuations and was\r\ntherefore risky and less favoured by Cypriot exporters.\r\n\r\nFor several reasons the Liverpool market has not been so attractive as\r\nthat of Marseilles. At Liverpool and Manchester quantities of not less\r\nthan, say, 100 bales are preferred, whereas Marseilles would take\r\nsmaller consignments of 20 or 40 bales. Uniformity of type is required\r\nby Manchester spinners, whereas the French factories are more ready to\r\nhandle different types, including the shorter staples. Cyprus merchants\r\nmake no distinction as regards the varieties of cotton, whether\r\n\"Orleans,\" \"Sea Island\" or other kinds, and indeed they are scarcely\r\ncompetent to do so, as this requires special knowledge and experience.\r\nThey buy in small quantities from many peasant growers and mix the\r\nproduce in order to make up a fair consignment.\r\n\r\nIn normal times there was always the further difficulty of obtaining\r\ndirect transport to England, whereas to Marseilles, Trieste and also to\r\nGreece the opportunities were more frequent.\r\n\r\nSince the war Greece has become much the largest buyer. Owing to\r\nshortage of cotton on the Greek market this commodity was purchased from\r\nCyprus rather than from Liverpool, as the freight was lower and war\r\nrisks much less; apart from the almost impossibility of obtaining\r\ntonnage. It was the practice before the war for Cypriot merchants to\r\nsell c.i.f. Piræus, but they could not continue this under recent\r\nconditions and now sell f.o.b. Cyprus, and this practice is likely to\r\ncontinue. This f.o.b. Cyprus price has lately been about the same as\r\nwould ordinarily be obtained for c.i.f. Liverpool. Greece has many small\r\nfilatures willing to take consignments of even 10 bales, and the\r\nshipment direct or via Alexandria is easier.\r\n\r\nA Cyprus bale weighs about 150 okes.\r\n\r\nThe following figures, showing average annual exports of raw cotton at\r\nvarious pre-war periods, indicate the course of the cultivation:\r\n\r\n  Period.

This\r\nmethod of cropping is locally known as \"palia\" or old. It is found\r\nprofitable to leave the cotton plants two or three years on irrigated\r\nland. The second-year crop usually gives the heaviest yield.\r\n\r\nThe average yield of unginned cotton on irrigated land is about 120 okes\r\n(3 cwts.) per scala; but as much as 250 okes can be obtained. \"Wet\"\r\ncotton, best quality, yields 1 oke of lint from 3 okes of unginned\r\ncotton, and \"dry\" cotton yields about 1 oke of lint from 3-1/3 okes of\r\nunginned cotton.\r\n\r\nThere is much land well suited to cotton which for lack of water cannot\r\nbe utilised. If artesian water could be found, there would be a very\r\nconsiderable extension of this cultivation.\r\n\r\nThere is a well-equipped little cotton factory at Famagusta, and\r\nexcellent cotton fabrics are made, especially in Nicosia neighbourhood,\r\nLapithos and Karavas, Lefkonico and Gypsos and in the Karpas. These are\r\nknown under the names of \"alaja\" and \"dimita.\" They are mostly of good\r\npatterns, the material is strong and wears well, and is being largely\r\nused, not only by the peasantry, but also for making men's suits and\r\nladies' skirts and cloths.\r\n\r\nAn interesting article on the Cyprus Cotton Industry is to be found in\r\nthe BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. iii. 1905, pp. 327-334.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flax and Linseed_\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of flax (_Linum usitatissimum_), which began to develop\r\nsome twenty years ago, has declined during the last ten years or so. The\r\nreasons for this are that it is considered to exhaust the soil, the\r\nlater handling of the crop for fibre is troublesome and the market is\r\nliable to rather violent fluctuations. It grows well in the Messaoria\r\nplain, and when chemical manures are more generally used it may come\r\nmore into favour. Attempts have been made to improve the quality by the\r\nintroduction of Riga flax seed, but so far without success. There is a\r\nsmall export of linseed, but owing to the primitive methods of winnowing\r\nand cleaning it does not fetch the best price. The quality of the\r\ncleaned seed is excellent. Knowledge and care are needed in picking the\r\ncrop at exactly the right time. The imperfect methods of general\r\ncultivation prevent the uniform ripening of the seed, and this means an\r\nuneven and unsatisfactory sample. Defective screening accounts for the\r\npresence in excess of foreign substances, weed seeds, etc. These\r\ndifficulties are capable of remedy, and it may reasonably be hoped that\r\nwhen once overcome the cultivation will be extended.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus the cultivation is the same whether intended for seed or\r\nfibre, and consequently the latter is of an inferior quality, as is\r\nindicated in a report on Cyprus flax published in the BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE (vol. vi. 1908, p. 4). Seed is sown in\r\nNovember-December at the rate of 17 to 22 okes per donum. Retting is\r\ndone by steeping in the large stone irrigation tanks which are a feature\r\non most farms. In the Messaoria, about Ano and Kato Zodia, where flax is\r\ncommonly grown, the plant is retted in the river Ovgos, which retains\r\nsufficient water usually until August. The yield per donum varies from\r\n100 to 300 okes of seed, 80 to 100 okes of fibre and 50 to 70 okes of\r\ntow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wool_\r\n\r\nThe exports of wool for the three last pre-war years were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Year.        Quantity.    Value.\r\n                 _Cwts._        £\r\n  1911  . . . .  5,535      13,452\r\n  1912  . . . .  4,627      11,362\r\n  1913  . . . .  4,707      12,181\r\n\r\nThis went chiefly to France, and next, though in much smaller\r\nquantities, to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe wool is of moderate quality; this is partly due to the breed of\r\nsheep and partly to the conditions under which they are kept. Attempts\r\nhave been made by the Agricultural Department to impress on the native\r\nbreeders the necessity of keeping the sheep well fed, and experiments\r\nhave been carried out at the Athalassa Experimental Farm for the purpose\r\nof demonstrating the advantages of careful rearing.\r\n\r\nTwo fleeces from the Athalassa Farm were sent to the Imperial Institute\r\nin May 1912, for examination and commercial valuation. One was the\r\nfleece of a yearling ram. This was clean, fairly soft and almost white.\r\nThe other was the fleece of a yearling ewe. This was clean, slightly\r\nharsh and almost white, but was slightly coarser than that of the ram.\r\n\r\nThese fleeces were considered by a firm of London brokers as an\r\nexcellent class of carpet wool and likely to meet always with a ready\r\nsale in the London market (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol.\r\nx. 1912, p. 537). A similar opinion was expressed immediately before the\r\nwar (July 1914) by a London firm to whom two bales of Cyprus wool had\r\nbeen sent, of which a part had been purchased in the bazaar and washed\r\nand trimmed by the Department and part came from the Athalassa\r\n(Government) flock. It was considered as \"an ideal wool for carpet\r\nmaking or for blankets, but deficient in lustre for braids.\"\r\n\r\nThe actual yield per sheep, viz. 3 to 3-1/2 lb., compares unfavourably\r\nwith that of Lincolns, which they most closely resemble. This is due\r\npartly to breed, but largely also to the conditions under which the\r\nsheep are kept (see p. 17).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hemp_\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of hemp (_Cannabis sativa_) is practically confined to\r\nthe southern part of the Paphos district, and there only in places where\r\nthe water-supply is ample. The plant is grown only for fibre, which is\r\nexclusively used for rope-making, which is carried out by hand by the\r\nvillagers round about Ktima. It would be of advantage to have a\r\nrope-making machine at work at a spot centrally situated in the area of\r\nproduction. A simple hand-worked machine is now being experimentally\r\nused and will, it is believed, turn out a better class of rope.\r\n\r\nThe plant grows well on fertile and irrigated lands. Farmyard manure,\r\nand specially sheep manure, are generally applied, and chemical\r\nfertilisers are now also coming into use.\r\n\r\nHarvesting takes place when the plants begin to turn pale. The plants\r\nare uprooted, not cut, and are made up into sheaves tied together at the\r\nbutt end only. The bundles are not more than 2-1/2 spans round, and of\r\nequal size. When first uprooted the sheaves are placed flat on the field\r\nin rows to dry and in such zig-zag fashion that the top end of one sheaf\r\nis always made to rest on the butt end of another, and thus does not\r\ncome into contact with the ground: this ensures the circulation of air\r\nand hastens the drying process. The sheaves are taken later to the\r\nthreshing-floors, where they are stood upright until they are dry. The\r\nseed is separated by beating. The sheaves are exposed to the sun until\r\nthe leaves are shed, and when the stems are entirely dry the bundles are\r\ntied up at both ends and are taken to the retting-place, which is\r\nusually the common stone tank or cistern of the country. There they are\r\nsteeped in water for six to nine days. The bundles are generally covered\r\nby about one foot of water. On the sixth day the fibre is tested. If it\r\nseparates easily the bundles are removed, if not they remain for another\r\ntwo or three days. This requires much care and experience, as the\r\nquality depends largely upon effective retting. Then they are taken out\r\nof the water and sun-dried, being piled up into pointed shooks, left\r\nhollow in the centre.\r\n\r\nThe fibre is separated by means of a wooden implement locally called\r\n\"melidjia.\" This consists of a wooden trough placed on two legs which\r\nare fixed in the ground. A wedge-shaped piece of wood which is hinged to\r\nthe trough at one end is used as the beater. The hemp stalks, after the\r\nbutts are cut off, are placed in the trough and the beater worked up and\r\ndown so as to split the stalks and lay bare the fibre.\r\n\r\nThe average production of fibre per scala is 60 to 80 okes, but where\r\nconditions are all favourable it may reach 160 to 200 okes and the seed\r\nyield may be anything from 80 to 200 okes per scala.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Silk_\r\n\r\nThe silkworm (_Bombyx mori_) finds in Cyprus a climate exceptionally\r\nfavourable to its development, and Cyprus silks have been famous for\r\ntheir quality throughout the middle ages and as far back as the sixth\r\ncentury A.D., when Greek monks first introduced silkworms from China.\r\n\r\nIn the fateful year 1845, when the disease pebrine nearly destroyed the\r\nsilk industry of Europe, the anxious search for healthy silkworm eggs\r\nthat then ensued led Arabs from Syria to visit Cyprus and buy large\r\nquantities of silk cocoons from which they raised and exported the eggs.\r\nAt that time, therefore, it is evident that Cypriot moths were well\r\nthought of. Pebrine soon reached Cyprus and almost brought the Island\r\nbreed to an end. Thanks, however, to the Pasteur system, whereby pebrine\r\nand other silkworm diseases have been brought under complete control,\r\nthe industry both here and elsewhere was not only saved but has been\r\nconsiderably developed.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1896 Mr. P. Gennadius, late Director of Agriculture, Cyprus,\r\nstated that the local production of silkworm eggs was so small that it\r\ncould not be taken into consideration, and from the figures then given\r\nthe total average annual production at that time is estimated to have\r\nbeen 35,000 okes of dry cocoons. This represented an average yield of\r\nonly 3-1/2 okes of dry cocoons, equal to 15-1/2 kilograms of fresh\r\ncocoons, per ounce of silkworm eggs. This compared very unfavourably\r\nwith the average annual production of fresh cocoons in France and Italy\r\nat that time, which was 35 kilograms and 30 kilograms respectively per\r\nounce of silkworm eggs. Moreover, this ratio had been, up to that\r\nperiod, on a descending scale.\r\n\r\nIn a report published in 1897 Mr. Gennadius attributed this\r\nunsatisfactory state of things to the following causes:\r\n\r\n1. The importation of cheap silkworm eggs of inferior quality; the\r\naverage price paid by merchants was 2 to 2-1/2 francs per ounce, while\r\nthe price in France ranged from 9 to 12 francs.\r\n\r\n2. The action of merchants who imported larger quantities of eggs than\r\nthey could properly dispose of.\r\n\r\n3. The ignorance and folly of rearers who undertook to rear far more\r\nworms than they could properly \"educate,\" having regard to space, leaves\r\nand labour.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the Department of Agriculture set to work, with some success,\r\nto improve the methods of rearing up to that time in vogue, and during\r\nthe six years ending 1913 (inclusive) the average annual quantity of\r\neggs hatched out was 12,319 oz., the average annual export of \"dry\"\r\ncocoons was 45,551 okes, and the average annual estimated local\r\nconsumption 4,449 okes, making a total annual production of 50,000 okes,\r\nas against 35,000 okes in 1896. The former total represents an average\r\nyield of about 4 okes of \"dry\" cocoons, equal to about 18 kilograms of\r\nfresh cocoons per ounce of seed, and marks a slight improvement upon the\r\nratio of eighteen years previously.\r\n\r\nSince 1914 this branch of work has received a larger share of attention\r\nfrom the Department. Five sericultural stations have been established,\r\nregulations have been issued, inspections by qualified persons have been\r\nsystematically made, practical advice has been given to rearers in the\r\nmatter of cleanliness, disinfection and so forth, the granting of\r\nlicences to egg-raisers has been put on a better footing and the whole\r\nindustry has been brought more under observation and control.\r\n\r\nNumerous suggestions have been made from time to time for insuring that\r\nonly a good quality of egg shall be imported. As an effective--perhaps\r\nthe most effective--means to this end, the Department of Agriculture has\r\nset itself to improve the production of local eggs and thus indirectly\r\ndiscourage their importation: holders of licences to raise eggs are\r\nrequired to pass periodical examinations; several have in consequence\r\nhad their licences cancelled, new licensees have been added, and many\r\nunlicensed persons have been prosecuted and convicted for illegally\r\nraising eggs.\r\n\r\nThe common method of hatching practised by villagers, by placing the\r\neggs tied in cloth with a little cotton-wool in their beds or by\r\ncarrying them on their persons, still prevails, but it is gradually\r\nyielding to a better system of incubation. The Department has designed a\r\nsimple, inexpensive hatching-box, and these are now being used with good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nUntil about three years ago probably 25 per cent. of the local rearers\r\nwere producing their own seed without any microscopical examination at\r\nall. Bad feeding, bad ventilation, ill-adapted premises were general.\r\nAs a consequence pebrine and flacherie played such havoc that many\r\npeople were beginning to abandon silkworm rearing and uproot their\r\nmulberry trees. The expansion and increased resources of the\r\nAgricultural Department happily came just in time to check this backward\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nSilk reeling is unfortunately done in the most primitive manner with\r\nwooden appliances and hot water by village hand labour. The locally\r\nreeled silk is used only for Island consumption and the great bulk of\r\ncocoons is exported in the raw state, mostly to Lyons and Milan. The\r\nburden of freight on this bulky cargo is naturally a heavy handicap and\r\nthe local silkworm rearers have consequently to be content with very low\r\nand inadequate prices for their cocoons. During the reeling process 20\r\nto 25 per cent. of the silk is lost, and a further loss is incurred\r\nduring weaving owing to the numerous knots having to be cut away and the\r\nsilk threads rejoined.\r\n\r\nA considerable loss is said to take place in selling cocoons in the\r\nEuropean markets. The cocoons on arrival at Marseilles are subjected to\r\nofficial tests and sold according to the reports made by the official\r\ntesters. It is of advantage to the buyers that the report should be made\r\nas unfavourable as possible as the price is lowered proportionately, and\r\nit is felt that the cocoons exported are thus placed too much at the\r\nmercy of the testing officials.\r\n\r\nThese Cyprus cocoons are reeled in France and Italy and the silk is\r\nlargely sold to England. It would be to the mutual benefit of England\r\nand Cyprus if a direct demand for Cyprus reeled silk could be created\r\nand modern reeling plant introduced into the Island. A large sum of\r\nmoney, now annually paid for freight, would thus be saved to the Cypriot\r\nproducers, which would stimulate the local industry and tend to increase\r\ngreatly the annual production and improve the local weaving of silk\r\nstuffs, an industry which has already gained considerable fame and at\r\nwhich the Cypriot women are adepts.\r\n\r\nAs the following table shows, the amount of raw silk exported is a\r\nnegligible quantity, but a fairly large quantity is locally reeled and\r\nis used in making the silk stuffs which are so much sought after in the\r\nlocal bazaars:\r\n\r\n   ___________________________________________________________________\r\n        Export of cocoons.   |    Export of     |  Export of raw silk\r\n                             |  cocoons waste.  |\r\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   _Year._|_Okes._|_Country._|_Okes._|_Country._|_Okes._|_Country._\r\n   -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    1909  |41,013 |France    | 2,120 |France    |    6  |Turkey\r\n    1910  |44,550 |  \"       | 1,105 |  \"       |  259  |  \"\r\n          |       |          |       |          |  157  |Egypt\r\n    1911  |57,422 |  \"       | 2,704 |  \"       |  246  |Turkey\r\n          |       |          |       |          |   70  |Egypt\r\n    1912  |43,196 |  \"       | 2,571 |  \"       |   90  |Turkey\r\n          |       |          |    70 |Turkey    |    3  |Greece\r\n    1913  |48,884 |  \"       | 2,502 |France    |  118  |Turkey\r\n   ___________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nEfforts have been made by the Agricultural Department to improve the\r\nCypriot race of silkworms. Two races of white colour, the Japanese and\r\nthe Baghdad, have been separately crossed with the yellow race of\r\nBaghdad. These crossings began in 1912-13 and have been continued up to\r\nthe present. The objects aimed at are to establish a new Cypriot race\r\n(_a_) giving good cocoons of a fine structure and larger in size than\r\nthe French variety and yielding a maximum quantity of silk; (_b_)\r\nproducing cocoons of a uniform colour and in demand in the European\r\nmarket and (_c_) with these characteristics constant.\r\n\r\nThe results obtained so far are promising, but uniformity of colour has\r\nnot yet been attained, though it is hoped that, by careful selection,\r\nthis will become more fixed every year. It may here be mentioned that\r\nthe famous French cream-coloured race took seventy-five years to become\r\nfully established owing to the widespread damage caused by pebrine and,\r\nto a lesser extent, by flacherie.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that silkworm eggs locally produced by qualified\r\nlicensees are decidedly more immune to disease and less affected by\r\nadverse atmospheric conditions than imported seed.\r\n\r\nThe local conditions of sericulture in Cyprus have undergone a change of\r\nlate years. Formerly Nicosia and Famagusta were the districts where this\r\nindustry was chiefly carried on; but latterly whole mulberry groves have\r\nbeen uprooted and replaced by fruit trees which are considered to be\r\nmore profitable. This was the inevitable result of the ignorant methods\r\nunder which the silkworm-rearing industry was conducted and the use of\r\nbad seed permitted, whereby disease was spread and annual loss\r\nincurred. It is hoped that the industry is now again on the upward\r\ngrade. One indication of this is that whereas a few years ago 1,000 to\r\n1,800 cocoons went to an oke, now the figure may be put at 500 to 1,000.\r\nAgain, the waste due to excess of floss is much less than formerly, and\r\nif only reeling by machinery can be introduced a very much better return\r\nwill result to the cocoon producer.\r\n\r\nIn the Karpas and in and around Nicosia a bi-voltine race is reared. The\r\nresults are poor, but the two rearings are made because in these\r\nlocalities there is an ample supply of leaves. From this race are\r\nproduced small cocoons locally called \"Confetti.\" They are only used for\r\nlocal silk manufacture.\r\n\r\nAn inferior silk called \"Koukoularika\" is made from the cocoons of the\r\nordinary or univoltine race, both those which have been stoved and those\r\nwhich have been badly stained when the moths emerged.\r\n\r\nThese cocoons, which, during the process of boiling in lye, have been\r\nbleached, are turned inside-out and the excrement of the larva removed.\r\nThe silk is then spun by hand with the \"atrachtos.\" These cocoons are\r\nmostly from laggard worms and of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe silk industry has suffered greatly from unscrupulous dealing on the\r\npart of the dealers in eggs. It is a common custom for these persons to\r\nsell imported seed at 2_s._ and even less per ounce, although the law\r\nrequires all such seed to be accompanied by a Consular certificate and\r\naffidavit showing that the price paid was not less than 4_s._ per ounce,\r\nexclusive of freight, carriage or insurance. Secret discounts,\r\npresumably, render this practice possible. The dealer does not ask for\r\npayment in cash, but requires it in kind at the rate of 1 oke in every 4\r\nokes of cocoons raised. If 28 okes of cocoons are obtained from 1 ounce\r\nof seed the dealer would get 7 okes, valued at say 2_s._ 6_d._ per oke =\r\n17_s._ 6_d._ for each ounce of seed. The dealer mostly gives a cash\r\nadvance of 10_s._ or £1 with the seed, stipulating that the crop is to\r\nbe sold exclusively to him, the price being left open. The unfortunate\r\nproducer is therefore in his toils.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of small Sericultural Societies would do much, both\r\nto encourage and cheapen the cost of growing mulberry trees and assist\r\nthe industry. A few such societies have lately been formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mulberry_\r\n\r\nThis tree (_Morus alba_) is grown extensively for silkworm feeding and\r\nis mostly found in those parts of the Island in which the silk industry\r\nis centred, viz. in the Marathassa valley and in the Karpas, fairly\r\ngenerally in and around Nicosia, Kyrenia and in the southern parts of\r\nthe Paphos district.\r\n\r\nLittle care is given to its cultivation. For the most part, in all the\r\nolder plantations, the trees are set too close together. This is less\r\nnoticeable in the newer plantations. Pruning, where given, is defective\r\nand so is the method of gathering the leaves.\r\n\r\nThe usual method is to cut off, every year, the shoots with the leaves\r\non them, from about one foot above the main branches. Two reasons are\r\ngiven for this by villagers. (1) It is quicker and easier to cut off\r\nthese shoots than to pick off the leaves while still on the tree. The\r\nshoots are brought into the \"magnanerie\" and there placed upright in\r\nwater and the leaves can then be removed more conveniently and at\r\nleisure. In this way the leaves remain fresh two days. (2) By cutting\r\nthese shoots in the spring, _i.e._ during the silkworm-rearing season,\r\nwhich begins in early April, fresh shoots are formed which bear leaves\r\nin late summer and autumn. The latter afford very welcome green food for\r\ncattle and sheep. These leaves are stripped direct from the growing\r\ntree. The effect of this second gathering is prejudicial to the tree,\r\nwhich is thereby exhausted. The leaves produced the following spring are\r\nfleshy and watery and in the uncertain weather of spring are apt to\r\ninduce flacherie.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaves and Aloes_\r\n\r\n_Agave americana_, _A. rigida_ var. _sisalana_, _Furcræa gigantea_,\r\n_Aloe ciliata_ and _A. frutescens_ all grow well and, if properly\r\ncultivated and handled, might be worth more attention than they at\r\npresent receive.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 a Cypriot from German East Africa who had been engaged in the\r\nproduction of Sisal hemp there was struck by the few excellent plants he\r\nfound growing in Cyprus, and, had sufficient suitable land been then\r\nobtainable, with transport facilities, was desirous of undertaking\r\ncultivation on a commercial basis.\r\n\r\nSamples of fibre prepared from the leaves of the abovementioned plants\r\nwere reported on by the Imperial Institute in 1912, but as the leaves\r\nhad been retted, and not scraped or scutched, their value was\r\ndepreciated, and this was estimated at from £14 to £18 per ton with best\r\nMexican Sisal hemp at £25 per ton.\r\n\r\nThe outlay for fencing against wandering flocks of goats and for\r\ndecorticating machinery and other expenses would deter the ordinary\r\ncultivator from planting, and this could only be profitably undertaken\r\nif ample capital were forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Broom Corn_\r\n\r\nUntil the end of last century all brooms of European type were imported.\r\nSeed of broom corn (_Sorghum vulgare_), known locally as \"tchihri\" or\r\n\"skoupa,\" was then introduced, and gradually the cultivation has\r\nextended and a good number of brooms of very fair quality are now\r\nlocally made. The process of broom-making is very simple and the high\r\nprice of the imported article during the war has led to a marked\r\nextension of the industry. The plant grows well, especially on irrigated\r\nland. The seed provides a good food for chickens and the stalks and\r\nleaves can be used as fodder. It is a profitable crop, especially when\r\nthe cultivator makes and sells the brooms himself, and is principally\r\ngrown in the Karpas and at Athienou.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO\r\n\r\nIn Turkish times tobacco was grown in several parts of the Island,\r\nthough not to any large extent.\r\n\r\n\"For centuries it was produced in many districts of the Island, and\r\nparticularly in the Karpas, near Kilani, Omodhos and Paphos, but from\r\nthe time it became an article of monopoly its production was subjected\r\nto rigorous restrictions, and its cultivation has been entirely\r\nabandoned.\" (Reports, pt. ii. (1896), P. Gennadius).\r\n\r\nThe quantity grown before the occupation appears to have been very\r\nfluctuating and to have averaged about 56,000 lb. annually, and the\r\nGovernment revenue, according to British Consular reports, would not\r\nhave been more than £300 to £400 per annum. The Régie was introduced in\r\n1874, but owing to the hampering restrictions the industry had been\r\npretty well crushed out by the time of British occupation in 1878.\r\nMeanwhile the revenue from tobacco, imported mainly from Volo and\r\nSalonica, increased greatly.\r\n\r\nThe monopoly ceased at the British occupation, but the regulations and\r\nimposts remained. Those responsible for controlling the industry,\r\ncollecting dues, and checking illicit consumption had a troublesome\r\ntask, while on the other hand the cultivator became averse to engaging\r\nin a cultivation which was hedged round with so many restrictions and\r\nformalities.\r\n\r\nThese exist at the present time and may here be quoted:\r\n\r\nThe grower has to notify the Customs authorities of his intention to\r\nsow, giving the locality and area. Before picking he must again notify\r\nthe Customs, so that a Customs officer may be present at the picking and\r\nweigh the freshly picked leaves. After storing, but before delivering\r\nthe tobacco to the factory, the Customs officer must again weigh the now\r\ndry leaves.\r\n\r\nThe excise duties leviable are: Tobacco leaf, 4-1/2_cp._ per oke,\r\npayable on transfer of leaf from grower to wholesale dealer. Tobacco\r\nmanufactured in Cyprus, whether made into cigarettes or otherwise, in\r\naddition to the import duty or transport duty, pays a banderolle duty of\r\n3_s._ 6-1/2_cp._ per oke.\r\n\r\nThese regulations are a relic of the Turkish times, as in those days the\r\nState received a definite due called \"City Toll\" by charging the tobacco\r\ncutters and tobacco sellers with a trade tax. They appear to have been\r\nadministered with more laxity in Turkish than in post-occupation times,\r\nand it is said that the abandonment of tobacco cultivation was mainly\r\ndue to the severity with which these rather vexatious and irritating\r\nregulations were enforced.\r\n\r\nFor many years the tobacco imported by local cigarette manufacturers\r\ncame almost entirely from Macedonia. This tobacco was of very superior\r\nquality and cheap, and locally grown tobacco could not compete with it.\r\nOf late years the price of Macedonian tobacco has risen considerably and\r\nthe manufacturers have therefore been induced to import Thessalian\r\ntobacco instead, which is not of so fine a flavour and approximates more\r\nclosely to Cyprus produce. Cypriot smokers have thus had their palates\r\nprepared for the flavour of the locally grown tobacco.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1912, when Houry's Cyprus Tobacco Association, Ltd., was\r\nformed, a revival in the industry set in. This has since received\r\nconsiderable impetus from the war, which, temporarily, has thrust\r\nMacedonian tobacco out of the market. The primary object of the\r\nAssociation was to manufacture tobacco and cigarettes from Cyprus-grown\r\ntobacco, although foreign tobacco could also be used. Tobacco then began\r\nto be regularly grown by the Association at a Chiftlik near Limassol and\r\nelsewhere, and cigarettes made therefrom have had a fair local sale. The\r\narrival of well-to-do refugees from Latakia and other parts of Syria,\r\nskilled in tobacco cultivation, led to great extension of this crop. A\r\nlarge part of the produce was at first converted into Latakia tobacco.\r\nOwing possibly to the lack of care and skill on the part of native\r\nlabour, partly perhaps to the unsuitability of the herbs and brushwood\r\nused in the fuming, the market was not found sufficiently encouraging\r\nand the Latakia, for which at best there is a very restricted market,\r\nhas almost ceased to be produced. Tobacco for cigarettes, however,\r\ncontinues to be grown on a fairly large scale, but in order that land\r\nsuitable for corn and other foodstuffs should not be sacrificed to\r\ntobacco, the cultivation of the latter is permitted only by special\r\nlicence. In 1916 and 1917 the industry fell almost entirely into the\r\nhands of the richer refugees, who were expert growers, and they\r\ncontracted with the small farmers and peasants. A number of speculative\r\ngrowers, professional men, merchants, etc., were tempted by the\r\nprevailing high prices to embark in the industry, but the licensing\r\nsystem has tended to throw it more into the hands of the _bona-fide_\r\nfarmers, who are allowed only to cultivate small areas which can be\r\nlooked after mainly by their own families. In 1916 the total production\r\nwas 89,065 okes, and the estimated yield for 1917 is 487,674 okes.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department has for some five years carried out\r\nexperimental growings in various districts, and samples of tobacco so\r\ngrown have been submitted to the Imperial Institute (see BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xiii. 1915, pp. 547-550). The two best samples\r\nreported on were grown in the Nicosia plain. They were said to conform\r\nwith the Turkish tobacco as regards size of leaf, but contained too much\r\nmoisture for the English market. The tobacco was found to smoke rather\r\nhot and was only mildly aromatic, but it was believed that these defects\r\nwould probably disappear with more experience in the curing. The samples\r\nreferred to were incompletely cured, having been submitted quickly in\r\norder to roughly ascertain their quality. The report on the whole was\r\nmoderately encouraging, and it is hoped that later samples which have\r\nbeen better cured will be found superior.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco grown in Cyprus is mostly of the Samsoun, Trebizond, Kavalla\r\nand Hassan Keff varieties.\r\n\r\nThe normal importation of tobacco into Cyprus is about 180,000 okes,\r\nwhich produces an import duty of £4,500 a year, at the rate of\r\n4-1/2_cp._ per oke.\r\n\r\nThe average amount paid for banderolles on tobacco when issued from\r\nfactories for consumption is about £30,000 a year, which at the rate of\r\n3_s._ 6-1/2_cp._ per oke equals a banderolle duty on 161,000 okes; the\r\ndifference of about 20,000 okes would be cigarettes exported on which no\r\nbanderolle duty is paid.\r\n\r\nIf, then, no tobacco were grown and none imported the Government would\r\nlose £35,000 revenue annually. It would appear to be immaterial from a\r\nrevenue point of view whether tobacco were imported or grown in the\r\nIsland, since the imposts are the same, viz. on imports 4-1/2_cp._ per\r\noke import duty and 3_s._ 6-1/2_cp._ per oke banderolle duty; on\r\nlocally grown tobacco 4-1/2_cp._ per oke transport duty and 3_s._\r\n6-1/2_cp._ per oke banderolle duty. There is, however, this difference,\r\nthat the money leaves the Island when the tobacco is imported and\r\nremains and fructifies when it is locally grown.\r\n\r\nTobacco cultivation is in many ways well suited to this Island, as a\r\ngreat part of its cultivation as well as the gathering may be done by\r\nwomen and children. It need not therefore make any serious demand upon\r\nman labour, which is already insufficient, and much of the work can be\r\nperformed by those who are unfit for heavy field work. It is a summer\r\ncrop, which is greatly in its favour, the quality when grown \"dry\" being\r\nmuch finer than when irrigated. Its introduction broadens the basis of\r\ncultivation, provides a revenue from land that would otherwise lie\r\nfallow and is a useful element in any system of rotation. As it calls\r\nfor careful preparation and thorough cultivation of the soil it has a\r\ngreat educative influence on a people prone to slovenly, primitive\r\nhusbandry, and corn crops following tobacco have frequently given a\r\nlarger, more uniform yield.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is an open question whether the crop can be grown\r\nand the leaf cured by the Cypriot farmer to produce a tobacco which,\r\nunder normal conditions, will successfully compete in quality and price\r\nwith the Macedonian tobacco.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANNING MATERIALS AND DYE-STUFFS\r\n\r\nTanneries are fairly numerous and large quantities of skins are tanned\r\nand sold to native boot-makers. Before the war, goat- and sheep-skins\r\nand ox-hides were practically the only kinds handled, the two former\r\nbeing mainly used for the uppers of boots. The top-boots worn by\r\nvillagers are nearly all made from goat-skin, locally called \"totmaria.\"\r\nSince the war pig-skins and dog-skins have been also used. Camel-skins\r\nare often employed for making soles.\r\n\r\nPine bark and sumach are the native tanning substances chiefly used in\r\nthe local tanneries. The pine is one of the commonest forest trees of\r\nthe Island. Shinia leaves (_Pistacia Lentiscus_) are also used (see p.\r\n51).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sumach_\r\n\r\nThe Sicilian, elm-leaved or tanner's sumach (_Rhus Coriaria_) is a shrub\r\nwhich grows wild throughout a large part of the Island, being\r\nprincipally found among the vineyards on the slopes of the southern\r\nrange of hills. The leaves are largely used in the leather tanning\r\nindustry, and a considerable export might have been established to the\r\nUnited Kingdom had it not been for dissatisfaction caused by the\r\nexcessive presence of impurities, such as lentisc leaves and dust, which\r\nwere usually found in the consignments sent.\r\n\r\nOne sample was sent by the Agricultural Department to the Imperial\r\nInstitute in 1909. This was found to consist wholly of sumach and no\r\nlentisc or other leaves, and gave on examination the following results:\r\nMoisture, 10.1; ash, 9.8; tannin (by hide-power method), 26.9;\r\nextractive matter (non-tannin), 16.7 per cent. The report showed that\r\nthe leaves produced a good leather, similar in texture and colour to\r\nthat obtained with Sicilian sumach, and was considered likely to fetch\r\nabout the same price as a medium quality of Sicilian sumach, which\r\ncontains from 25 to 30 per cent. of tannin (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL\r\nINSTITUTE, vol. x. 1912, p. 45).\r\n\r\nTwo further samples were sent in 1916. The first sample \"consisted of a\r\nfinely-ground yellowish-green powder, containing a quantity of sand,\r\nsmall stones and iron dust.\" The second sample consisted of a\r\n\"coarsely-ground, yellowish-green powder, containing a quantity of\r\npinkish unground twigs, sand and small stones, together with some iron\r\ndust.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of examination were as follows:\r\n\r\n                                    NO. 1.    NO. 2.\r\n                                    _Per cent._   _Per cent._\r\n  Moisture                             9.3              9.2\r\n  Insoluble matters                   53.6             57.8\r\n  Extractive matters (non-tannin)     14.6             13.0\r\n  Tannin                              22.5             20.0\r\n  Ash                                  8.5             12.3\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Tintometer readings--Red             0.7              1.2\r\n                       Yellow          2.1              2.5\r\n\r\nBoth samples were low in tannin, compared with the Sicilian percentage\r\nof 25 to 30.\r\n\r\nSample No. 1 was valued at £13, and No. 2 at £12, per ton, with Sicilian\r\nsumach at £15 per ton; the lower value being due to the lower tannin\r\ncontents, owing to the presence of sand, dirt, etc. It may be assumed\r\nthat if more care in preparing clean samples were taken, Cyprus sumach\r\nwould greatly improve its market value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valonea_\r\n\r\nThere are a few well-grown specimens of valonea oak (_Quercus Ægilops_)\r\nto be seen, but being a slow grower and as it takes many years to reach\r\nthe stage when it yields a profit, it does not commend itself to the\r\nCypriot tree planter. It prefers deep soil and requires artificial\r\nirrigation or a greater rainfall than we have in Cyprus.\r\n\r\nIt has been tried at Salamis and failed, and also at Machaera with the\r\nsame result. It has been grown also on Troödos, but after six years'\r\ngrowth attained a height of only 1 foot.\r\n\r\nOnly an insignificant quantity of Valonea cups are locally produced.\r\nThese come from the Paphos district and are said to be rather poor in\r\ntannin. The bulk comes from Anatolia. The pre-war price for the latter\r\nwas 5_s._ per cantar of 44 okes, that for the locally grown was 20 paras\r\nper oke on the spot, transport charges bringing up the price to about 1\r\ncopper piastre per oke delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Acacia Barks_\r\n\r\n_Acacia pycnantha_ has been grown in Cyprus, but does not acclimatise\r\nwell, and neither the soil nor climate seems favourable. _A. mollissima_\r\nalso has not shown any very successful growth. _A. cyanophylla_ and _A.\r\nlongifolia_, on the other hand, thrive excellently. They are great\r\ndrought-resisters and grow on almost any soil. They have been very\r\nextensively grown by the Forest Department in every district for fuel\r\nand along the coast upon sand dunes. They have not been utilised so far\r\nfor the extraction of tanning, except experimentally. Samples of the\r\nbarks of the two last-named species were found on examination at the\r\nImperial Institute to be too poor in tannin to be worth exporting, but\r\nthey should be quite suitable for use in Cyprus (see BULLETIN OF THE\r\nIMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xi. 1913, pp. 412-414).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Madder_\r\n\r\nIn former years, and within the period of the British occupation, the\r\ncultivation of madder (_Rubia tinctorum_) was fairly flourishing in\r\nCyprus. The old madder grounds can still be distinguished, and are\r\nmostly to be seen near Morphou, Ayia Irini, Sotira, Ayios Serghios,\r\nFamagusta and Larnaca. These madder grounds were excavations made in\r\norder to expose the soil lying beneath 10 to 30 ft. of drift-sand; and\r\nthey form, as it were, a series of tanks along the shore. The red dye\r\nobtained from the dried and ground madder roots constituted at one time\r\none of the most valued of dye-stuffs, and was in special demand for\r\nmilitary uniforms; but this has been entirely superseded by artificial\r\ncoal-tar derivatives and, as Gennadius says: \"The happy days of the\r\ncultivation of this plant are past, never to return.\"\r\n\r\nIt is propagated mostly by root cuttings. The leaf begins to dry at\r\nabout the sixth month. There is no further growth above ground, but the\r\nroots continue to increase and shoot downwards till moisture affects\r\nthem. \"When they get too wet, they become black or rot. In Cyprus this\r\nrotting would often begin after about eighteen months, while in superior\r\nsoils the roots would continue to improve during thirty-six months, and\r\nthey would be known in the trade as eighteen months and thirty-six\r\nmonths roots. In Famagusta district they remain mostly eighteen months,\r\nwhile at Morphou they would continue fully thirty-six months, during the\r\nwhole of which time the surface ground should be kept free of weeds.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the root is lifted it is generally dried; if packed before quite\r\ndry, it ferments and deteriorates.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half tons of dried roots would be produced from an acre of\r\ngood ground, and the madder grounds used to fetch a very high price.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUGS AND OTHER PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n_Liquorice Root_\r\n\r\nThe liquorice plant (_Glycyrrhiza glabra_, Linn.) grows mainly in the\r\nFamagusta and Kyrenia districts, and the roots are collected and\r\nexported from time to time. Two samples were reported upon in 1917 by\r\nthe Imperial Institute (see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xv.\r\n1917, p. 312) and the following opinions of two London firms of brokers\r\nwere elicited.\r\n\r\n(_a_) One firm described the Lapithos (Kyrenia district) roots as medium\r\nto bold unpeeled roots of good flavour, fairly well cleaned and very\r\nwell dried; and valued them at from 50_s._ to 55_s._ per cwt. ex wharf,\r\nLondon (February 1917). The firm described the Famagusta roots as\r\nthinner than the Lapithos sample and not so well freed from smooth\r\nvalueless pieces, but mentioned that they had apparently been washed.\r\nThey valued these roots at 50_s._ per cwt. ex wharf, London (February\r\n1917). The firm added that both samples were exceptionally dry, and that\r\nit seemed doubtful if the material in the bulk would be as dry.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A second firm considered the roots to be rather mixed, inferior\r\nquality, and worth at that time about 45_s._ per cwt. in London\r\n(February 1917).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pyrethrum_\r\n\r\n_Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum) cinerariæfolium_ grows well from seed and is\r\nan attractive garden plant with pretty, marguerite-like flowers. These\r\nyield the pyrethrum of commerce so largely used as an insecticide, and\r\nwhich is said to form the chief ingredients in various flea powders.\r\nThese flowers, when dried and ground to dust, are employed for this\r\npurpose by the natives. The original pyrethrum powder came from plants\r\ngrowing in Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nThe plant was introduced into the Cyprus Government Gardens some twenty\r\nyears ago and has since spread more or less throughout the Island. It is\r\nperennial and drought-resistant, and will also stand several degrees of\r\nfrost and seems indifferent to soil, provided it is not too damp. The\r\nseed is sown in September and the seedlings are transplanted in April or\r\nMay, but it multiplies itself readily by suckers. The flowers, which are\r\nabout three times the size of the Chamomile (_Matricaria Chamomilla_),\r\nwhich they closely resemble, are gathered as soon as they are fully\r\nopen, and are then dried in a well-ventilated room. They are usually\r\nsold in bales of 50 to 100 kilogrammes. One donum may produce about 100\r\nokes of flowers annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Squill_\r\n\r\nBulbs of the local squill were submitted in 1917 to Kew and\r\nprovisionally identified as _Urginea Scilla._ Like the asphodel, this\r\nroot is found everywhere. If sliced and placed about the house they are\r\nsaid to drive away mice. It was intended by the Agricultural Department\r\nto make an attempt to find a market for these roots, in the hope that if\r\nthey could obtain a small payment for them farmers might be induced to\r\ncollect them off their lands, but the project had to be abandoned for\r\nthe time owing to the war. There is a small demand for these roots, if\r\nsliced and dried, in Europe for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nSquill bulbs from Cyprus were examined at the Imperial Institute in 1916\r\n(see BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL INSTITUTE, vol. xv. 1917, p. 311). The\r\nsamples, which were submitted to a firm of drug manufacturers, were\r\nobjected to on account of their dark colour, and were valued at about\r\n6_d._ per lb. as against a pre-war value of 3_d._ per lb.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report by the Imperial Institute there are two\r\nvarieties of _Urginea Scilla,_ white and red, the scales of the former\r\nbeing yellowish-white and those of the latter having a reddish tint, and\r\nthere are also many intermediate forms. Though the red and the white\r\nvarieties have been stated to possess equal medicinal value, the white\r\nvariety is preferred in England.\r\n\r\nIn making stone irrigation channels which are lined with a coating of\r\nlime and sand or earth, local masons sometimes rub over this lining with\r\na sliced squill which has been dipped in oil. It is found that this\r\ntends to harden and glaze the lining and prevent it from cracking.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colocynth or Bitter Apple_\r\n\r\nThe colocynth (_Citrullus Colocynthis_), locally called \"pikrankoura\" or\r\n\"petrankoura,\" grows wild in some parts of the plains. The round\r\nyellowish-green fruit, about the size of an orange or small melon,\r\nripens in July to September and, after being gathered, is skinned and\r\ndried in the sun. It is used by druggists as a purgative. Until about\r\nten years ago it was cultivated on a small scale and an annual export of\r\nabout £400 in value took place, chiefly to England and Austria. It was\r\nthen in demand, it is said, as an adulterant of quinine. The fruit is\r\nlocally thought to be a remedy for rheumatism. For this purpose the\r\nfruits are picked and put in a saucepan and covered with olive oil.\r\nAfter cooking for six hours the pulp or ointment is rubbed into the\r\naffected part. The European demand having ceased, the plant is now only\r\nfound in a wild state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asphodel_\r\n\r\nThe asphodel (_Asphodelus ramosus_), locally known as \"spourdellos\" or\r\n\"spourtoulla,\" is a troublesome and abundant weed in many parts of the\r\nIsland, up to an altitude of about 4,000 ft. The peasant farmer rarely\r\nattempts to remove it, though it occupies a large proportion of his land\r\nto the detriment of the crops. In the hills the villagers dry the bulbs\r\nand feed them to their sheep, cattle and donkeys. A paste is also made\r\nfrom the roots which is used by boot-makers to stick the leathers\r\ntogether. To make this paste the roots are dried in the oven and ground,\r\nand then mixed with ground vetches or maize and made into the gum or\r\npaste locally known as \"tsirichi.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _A quantity of stored plant was destroyed by fire, reducing\r\nthe output._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MINOR AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bee-keeping_\r\n\r\nAlthough Cyprus bees are world-famed, bee-keeping in the Island is still\r\nin its infancy.\r\n\r\nThe native hive is generally an earthenware cylinder or pipe about 2 ft.\r\n6 in. long and 9 in. in diameter (see Plate VII, fig. 1). Hives are also\r\nmade of a mixture of earth and chopped straw, similar to native\r\nmud-bricks. These hives are also cylindrical, about 18 in. long and 10\r\nto 12 in. in diameter with a 3-in. thickness of wall. These are cooler\r\nin summer and warmer in winter, and produce stronger colonies than the\r\nearthenware ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--Cypriot Earthenware Beehives.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--Shipping Fruit at Larnaca.]\r\n\r\nOf late years the Agricultural Department has introduced modern hives\r\nwith movable frames, and had it not been for the high cost of timber\r\nsince the war, the number of these would have increased rapidly. The\r\ndifficulty is to get the local carpenters to construct them properly and\r\nwith finish. Practical hive construction is taught at the Agricultural\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\nCyprian bees are, par excellence, the yellow race of the world. They are\r\nof uniform colour, size and character, slightly smaller than the\r\nItalians and the blacks. They have great power of flight, are very\r\nprolific and vigorous and good honey-gatherers. They are by many\r\nconsidered vicious and ill-tempered. This is possibly due to the\r\nconstant war they have to wage against hornets, which in this country\r\nare a real plague and frequently exterminate whole colonies and\r\nsometimes whole apiaries. Various devices are employed for the\r\nprotection of bees in or near the hives.\r\n\r\nA good number of Cyprian queen bees have been imported into Europe and\r\nAmerica, and are very highly regarded wherever they have been\r\nestablished. In the eighties Cyprian queens were sold in the United\r\nStates of America at £2 each. This high price checked the importation\r\nand the crossing of Cyprians with Italians and blacks took place, the\r\nhybrid offspring being sold by dealers as Cyprians. These, however, did\r\nnot possess the best characteristics of Cyprians, and for a time they\r\nbrought about a reaction in favour of other breeds.\r\n\r\nCyprus possesses excellent honey-producing plants in the eucalyptus\r\ntrees, orange groves, \"throumbia\" or wild thyme, and other aromatic\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of orange groves a competent bee-keeper can obtain\r\nan average of 50 lb. of honey per colony; although unfortunately the\r\nordinary village bee-keeper gets little more than 6 to 10 lb.\r\n\r\nLocally produced beeswax is of fine quality with delicious aroma and of\r\na bright yellow colour, said to be superior to that imported from Asia\r\nMinor and Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe industry is susceptible of considerable development and, when\r\nbrought under more complete control, should be capable of establishing a\r\ngood export trade of honey and possibly of beeswax.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Basket-making_\r\n\r\nBasket-making is a considerable industry, as all fruit and much other\r\nproduce is transported in baskets mostly designed for the backs of\r\ndonkeys or mules. The export trade of fruit and vegetables creates a\r\nconstant demand (see Plate VII, fig. 2). The bulk of these baskets are\r\nmade of reeds (_Arundo_) which grow luxuriantly by the side of water\r\nchannels or wherever moist soil is found. This material is not an ideal\r\none for the purpose, as the baskets are easily crushed and lose shape,\r\nto the detriment of the contents. The reeds are therefore often\r\nstiffened by the introduction of an occasional breadth of some other\r\nmaterial, _e.g._ shinia (_Pistacia Lentiscus_), tremithia or myrtle. All\r\nthese are much used in basket-making, though the latter is heavy. There\r\nis a native willow (_Salix alba_) and also the weeping willow (_S.\r\nbabylonica_). These have not been used until recently when, by the\r\nefforts of the Agricultural Department, a number of these trees have\r\nbeen pollarded and the new shoots have been found quite satisfactory for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nSix years ago a number of osier cuttings were imported from England, but\r\nunfortunately they have not succeeded so far owing to a succession of\r\ndry years. The surviving plants were this autumn removed to a more\r\nsuitable site, but after suffering from drought they have now been\r\nalmost destroyed by heavy floods.\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage the manufacture of better baskets for the fruit\r\ntrade between Cyprus and Egypt the Agricultural Department provides\r\npractical instruction in basket-making, and a qualified teacher pays\r\noccasional visits to basket-making villages and demonstrates the work\r\nand teaches improved patterns to the villagers and school boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fruit and Vegetable Preserving_\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the establishment of small factories for\r\ncanning or bottling fruits and vegetables would be a profitable\r\nundertaking. Owing to the suddenness with which, in the heat of summer,\r\nthe fruits ripen in Cyprus, and the consequent glut that often ensues,\r\nmarket prices fall to a point at which it does not pay to pick and\r\nhandle. Transport difficulties also make it precarious, in the case of\r\nsoft fruits, to attempt a sale outside the immediate place of\r\nproduction. Increased cultivation is thus discouraged.\r\n\r\nIn growing fruits or vegetables for canning or bottling a man is\r\nindependent of market fluctuations, whereas at present both producers\r\nand consumers are in the hands of the local shopkeepers, who have the\r\nformer entirely at their mercy.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian fruit and vegetable trade is very well worth cultivating,\r\nbut until better measures can be enforced in the matter of transport by\r\nsea as well as land, shippers run the risk of heavy losses, which, no\r\ndoubt, recoil upon the unlucky producers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpecimens of most of the products referred to in these notes may be seen\r\nin the Cyprus Court in the Public Exhibition Galleries of the Imperial\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n_Printed by Hazell, Watson & Viney, Ld., London and Aylesbury, England._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nIn the original, illustrations were marked as 'facing page.'
