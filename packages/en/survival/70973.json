From that war, however, many\r\nlessons will have been learnt, which will, it is hoped, make the\r\ncourse of progress in the future more sure and perhaps more rapid.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of cotton has now been shown to be successful and\r\nprofitable in Nigeria. In the Northern Provinces great progress\r\nhas been made in perfecting a cotton originally grown from\r\n“American Upland” seed, whilst the Southern Provinces have\r\nproduced increasing quantities of an improved native cotton of the\r\ntype of “Middling American.” The future of cotton production in\r\nNigeria is now assured, and its further development chiefly depends\r\non effective action being taken on commercial lines.\r\n\r\nThe products of the oil palm and especially palm kernels have been\r\nin increased demand for edible purposes, the war having led to a\r\nfar greater use of margarine and similar materials. The perfection\r\nof processes for the better extraction of palm oil from the fruits\r\nwhich had nearly reached success at the outbreak of war now awaits\r\ncompletion, when a large additional source of edible oil will be\r\navailable. In the meantime the trial cultivation of this palm in\r\nother countries has been attended with remarkable success, the growth\r\nof the palm in plantations having been entirely satisfactory and\r\nfurnished yields of oil which exceed those given by the wild palm\r\nin West Africa. The Dutch East Indies, where large plantations have\r\nbeen made, and also British Malaya, where similar enterprise has been\r\nshown, may before long be formidable rivals to West Africa in the\r\nproduction of palm kernels and palm oil. The neglect in West Africa\r\nof the wild trees, the imperfect methods followed in extracting the\r\npalm oil, and the large number of palms unutilised are questions\r\nwhich now need renewed attention, and in fact the entire subject\r\nof the development of the palm-oil industry in West Africa demands\r\nthe most serious study in all its aspects if the industry is not\r\nto be supplanted by the enterprise of other countries.\r\n\r\nIn this and other directions where the continuous acquisition\r\nof new knowledge is requisite, it is satisfactory to learn that\r\nthe staffs of the Agricultural Departments in West Africa are\r\nto be extended and better remunerated. In addition to this step,\r\nand perhaps equally important, will be the increased interest and\r\nactivity of those merchants and manufacturers who utilise the raw\r\nmaterials of the country, and to whom the commercial development\r\nof West Africa has hitherto owed so much.\r\n\r\nThere are many other subjects which, it will be seen from the new\r\nedition of this book, have come to the front since the first edition\r\nappeared, and now need increased attention.\r\n\r\nThe only rubber tree which has survived as a producer in the years\r\nof strenuous competition is _Hevea brasiliensis_, from which Para\r\nrubber is obtained. Successful plantations of this tree have been\r\nestablished both in the Southern Provinces of Nigeria and in the Gold\r\nCoast, and from the former commercial rubber is now being produced\r\nof quality equal to that of the rubber plantations of the East.\r\n\r\nThe Gold Coast has become the chief cocoa producer of the world,\r\nbut it is clear that unremitting care and attention in connection\r\nwith the cultivation and the preparation of cocoa in that country\r\nwill be necessary if that supremacy is to be maintained.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the production of fibres, cinchona bark,\r\ncinnamon, tobacco, and many other materials, there are promising\r\npossibilities in various parts of West Africa, including those new\r\nterritories for which, as a result of the war, Great Britain is\r\nnow responsible. Above all, there is the dominant problem of the\r\ngrowth of foodstuffs sufficient to maintain the native populations\r\nof these countries.\r\n\r\nMr. Dudgeon, within the limits imposed in the production of a revised\r\nbut not greatly enlarged edition, has successfully brought this\r\nHandbook up-to-date, and it is hoped that it will continue to serve\r\nas a standard guide to all those who require general information\r\nrespecting the agricultural and forest products of West Africa.\r\n\r\n                                                 WYNDHAM R. DUNSTAN.\r\n\r\n  IMPERIAL INSTITUTE,\r\n    _March_ 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION=\r\n\r\nThe present series of Handbooks is intended to present a general\r\naccount of the principal commercial resources of the tropics,\r\nand has been written with special reference to the resources of\r\nBritish West Africa. These Handbooks will furnish a description of\r\nthe occurrence, cultivation and uses of those tropical materials,\r\nsuch as cotton and other fibres, cocoa, rubber, oil-seeds, tobacco,\r\netc., which are of importance to the producer in the tropics,\r\nas well as to the manufacturer and consumer in Europe.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to include all the detailed information of a\r\nsystematic treatise on each of the subjects included, it is believed\r\nthat these Volumes will contain much information which will be of\r\nvalue to the tropical agriculturist as well as to the merchant and\r\nmanufacturer. They will also be of importance to Government Officials\r\nin tropical Colonies where the advancement of the Country and the\r\nwelfare of its inhabitants depend so largely on the development\r\nof natural resources. In recent years those candidates who are\r\nselected for administrative appointments under the Colonial Office\r\nin British West Africa are required to pass through a short course\r\nof instruction in tropical cultivation and products, which is now\r\narranged at the Imperial Institute. For these prospective officials\r\nthe present series of Handbooks will be helpful in the study of a\r\nlarge and generally unfamiliar subject. Similarly it is believed that\r\nthe series will provide a valuable aid to the teaching of commercial\r\ngeography. It is hoped also that the Handbooks will not be without\r\ninterest for the student of Imperial and national problems.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the productivity of the tropics, and especially\r\nof the tropical regions within the British Empire, is important,\r\nnot only for the natives of those countries, and others who are\r\nactually engaged in tropical enterprise, but for the merchant and\r\nmanufacturer at home. The preparation for general use of cotton\r\nand other fibres, of tea, coffee and cocoa, of oils, of tobacco,\r\nand of numerous other products exported from the tropics, provides\r\nthe means of employment and livelihood for a very large proportion\r\nof the working population of this country, whilst every one at home\r\nis interested in securing an adequate supply at a moderate cost of\r\nthese necessaries and luxuries of life.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of these Handbooks, treated as they will be, as far\r\nas possible, in non-technical language, should therefore appeal to\r\na large class of readers.\r\n\r\nThe present Handbook deals with the Agricultural and Forest Products\r\nof British West Africa and serves as an introduction to this\r\nseries. Mr. Dudgeon, who until lately was Inspector of Agriculture\r\nin the West African Colonies and Protectorates, writes with an\r\nunrivalled knowledge of his subject, and gives a comprehensive\r\naccount of the vegetable products of that country, which will afford\r\nto the general reader some idea of the enormous possibilities of this\r\nBritish territory now in the process of rapid commercial development.\r\n\r\n                                                 WYNDHAM R.

It is the\r\nmost northerly of the British West African possessions.\r\n\r\n=Area and Population.=—The extent of territory is said to be 3,619\r\nsquare miles, much of which consists of low-lying land intersected\r\nby creeks and rivers, which under tidal influence are often densely\r\nafforested with mangroves.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1911 the Colony and Protectorate had\r\npopulations of 7,700 and 138,401 respectively, totalling 146,101. The\r\ntotal of 90,404 given in the previous census is now admitted\r\nto have been below the actual amount. A large migratory farming\r\ncommunity exists, coming annually from the adjoining countries,\r\nfor the purpose of raising groundnut crops. This in 1911 numbered\r\n3,367. Many of these immigrants are reported to have remained and\r\nestablished themselves permanently under the British flag.\r\n\r\n=Tribes.=—The principal tribes inhabiting the Gambia are the\r\nMandingoes, Foulahs, Joloffs, and Jolahs. The first-named are\r\nthe most numerous, and are, generally speaking, Mohammedans,\r\nalthough there are many “Sonninkis” or spirit drinkers among\r\nthem. The Foulahs are identical with the Fulanis of the Gold Coast\r\nand Northern Nigeria, and are frequently fair-skinned without\r\nnegroid features. They are said to be strictly Mohammedan, and to\r\nhave originated from the country near the source of the Senegal\r\nriver. The Joloffs occupy the northern bank of the Gambia river,\r\nand extend well into Senegal. The Jolahs inhabit the province of\r\nFogni, and spread into the confines of French territory towards\r\nthe Casamance river. They are a curious race, given to living in\r\nsmall family villages, and are said to be vindictive. They are of\r\na lower type than the three other tribes mentioned, and are jealous\r\nof their rights.\r\n\r\n=Political Divisions.=—The Protectorate is divided into five\r\ndistricts, each under the control of a Travelling Commissioner. These\r\ndistricts are named in accordance with their positions: North Bank,\r\nSouth Bank, M‘Carthy Island, Kommbo and Fogni, and Upper River.\r\n\r\n=Natural Conditions.=—The climatic conditions of the country\r\nare favourable to the breeding of cattle and horses, although in\r\nthe vicinity of the river and creeks two species of tsetse fly are\r\ncommon. By carefully preventing animals from straying into these\r\ninfested tracts the spread of fly-borne disease is held in check,\r\nand cases are comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nDuring the dry season, which often occupies seven months in the\r\nyear, from November to May, the highest maximum and the lowest\r\nminimum temperatures are recorded; the range being from 41° (lowest\r\nminimum, March 1909) to 105° (highest maximum, March 1909 and April\r\n1911). The rainfall, of which official records are kept at Bathurst,\r\nvaries considerably, as the following extract will serve to show:\r\n\r\n  1901   45·31   inches   1910   44·00   inches\r\n  1902   29·42     „      1911   28·14     „\r\n  1903   57·13     „      1912   33·99     „\r\n  1904   38·02     „      1913   23·68     „\r\n  1905   66·07     „      1914   48·91     „\r\n  1906   64·36     „      1915   47·64     „\r\n  1907   34·00     „      1916   38·02     „\r\n  1908   43·54     „      1917   37·68     „\r\n  1909   56·59     „      1918   54·03     „\r\n\r\n=Soil.=—The soil generally is of a light sandy nature,\r\nbecoming stiffer as the undulating regions of the upper river are\r\napproached. The low countries are subject to flood in the rainy\r\nseason, and are only favourable for rice cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOLAH WITH NATIVE HAND-PLOUGH, BULLELAI, FOGNI.\r\n\r\nFig. 1, p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANARY ISLAND PLOUGH, AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL, ABUKO.\r\n\r\nFig. 2, p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUBBER TREE (_FICUS VOGELII_) AT BATHURST.\r\n\r\nFig. 3, p. 9.]\r\n\r\n=Chief Crops.=—The country is rather sparsely populated, but, on\r\nthe whole, the people are fair cultivators and prepare their lands\r\nin a careful manner. Practically the only crop grown for export is\r\nthe groundnut, monkey-nut, or earth-pea (_Arachis hypogæa_), which\r\nforms by far the most important article of cultivation. Alternating\r\nthis with the staple food-crops of the country, namely, guinea-corn,\r\nmaize, millet, and cassava, a fairly useful form of rotation is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n=Implements.=—Cultivation among the Mandingoes and Joloffs is\r\nperformed by means of a large wooden-bladed, iron-shod hoe, with\r\nwhich the loose earth ridges are thrown up. A small iron hoe is\r\nused for keeping down weeds and clearing. In the Jolah country a\r\nhandplough is employed, consisting of a flat blade attached to\r\na pole, and pushed in front of the operator, so as to throw up\r\na shallow ridge. This is shown in the picture which represents a\r\nnative with the implement at Bullelai (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n=Ploughing.=—Cattle are plentiful, even to the extent of there\r\nbeing an insufficiency of fodder for them in the dry season in some\r\nlocalities. They are chiefly kept for the purpose of displaying\r\nthe wealth of their owners, and are not employed for any kind of\r\nfarm work. Notwithstanding the shortage of manual labour and the\r\nsuccessful demonstrations made by the Government, through the agency\r\nof the Roman Catholic Fathers at the Abuko Agricultural School, to\r\nprove the value of substituting animal draught for manual labour\r\nin tilling the land, the prejudice on the part of the natives\r\nagainst the use of their cattle for ploughing or cartage has not\r\nbeen overcome. A photograph is given showing a native with a Canary\r\nIsland plough drawn by locally-trained bullocks (Fig. 2). Owing to\r\nthe failure attending the efforts to introduce ploughing and cattle\r\nbreeding at Abuko, where, for the latter purpose, some Ayrshire\r\nbulls were provided, the Govermnent withdrew the provisional subsidy\r\nin 1911.\r\n\r\n=Land Tenure.=—Land ownership is hereditary and descends from\r\nfather to son among the Mandingoes and Joloffs. No fees are paid\r\nor presents given to chiefs when a transfer is made. Europeans can\r\nrent land from Government in cases where it is not held or claimed\r\nby a native. Grants are apparently issued for various periods,\r\nbut freehold rights are not given.\r\n\r\nThe rules regarding the itinerant, so-called “strange farmers,”\r\nwho annually visit the country to plant groundnuts, vary to some\r\nextent in different parts of the Protectorate. Where hereditary\r\nruling chiefs exist, a tax of 4_s_. per head is paid to them. In\r\nother places, half of this tax goes to Government, one-quarter to\r\nthe chief, and one-quarter to the farmer’s landlord. The landowner\r\ngenerally gives the groundnut seed and food as well as a piece of\r\nland to be cultivated. In payment for the seed and food, it is a\r\nrule to give one-tenth of the crop. During the time the strange\r\nfarmer is in occupation he is expected to give one or two days’\r\nwork each week on the landowner’s own farm.\r\n\r\n=Labour.=—There is no fixed rate paid by the Government for\r\nlabour. All the work on a farm is done by the owner and his own boys,\r\nbut occasionally others come in to assist from the neighbouring\r\nfarms, but no payment is made—only a present of kolas being\r\nusually given.\r\n\r\n=Agricultural Schools.=—An agricultural school, previously\r\nreferred to, was started at Abuko, near Lammin, under the\r\nRoman Catholic Fathers there, and a subsidy was granted by the\r\nGovernment especially for the purpose of educating the sons of large\r\ncultivators and chiefs in the use of ploughs and other labour-saving\r\nimplements. A stipulation was made that the work should be inspected\r\nby a Government officer from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this a fear was expressed at the outset that the\r\nattendance at these schools would be disappointing, in view of the\r\nfact that Mohammedan chiefs would be restrained by their mallams\r\nfrom sending their children where there might be a risk of their\r\nreligious conversion. Although it had been specially laid down\r\nthat no religious teaching would be insisted upon, the fear proved\r\njustified and the school never became a success, the attendance\r\nbeing only of a few aliens. Since the closing of this school no\r\nrenewal of agricultural instruction seems to have been made.\r\n\r\n=Chief Exports.=—The following table gives the average amounts\r\nand values of the chief exports for 1900-10, and the individual\r\nfigures for the remaining years to 1918.\r\n\r\n                Groundnuts   Rubber lbs.

None has been exported since.\r\n\r\n=GROUNDNUTS.=—This commodity is by far the most important exported\r\nproduct, and is alone subject to a duty levied by the Administration.\r\n\r\n=Uses.=—The undecorticated nuts are shipped, chiefly, to the French\r\nports and to Hamburg, for the expression of an oil of excellent\r\nquality, of which they yield on an average about 30 per cent.,\r\nestimated on the weight of the raw material. This is equivalent to\r\nabout 44 per cent. of the weight of the extracted kernels.\r\n\r\nThe mode of extraction in general employment in France is to grind\r\nthe kernels into a fine meal, from which the first quality of oil is\r\nextracted by cold expression, yielding about 18 per cent. The meal\r\nis then moistened with cold water, and at the second expression 6 per\r\ncent. more is obtained. Both of these oils are useful for alimentary\r\npurposes. A third expression is made from the residue treated with\r\nhot water, and gives a further 6 per cent., which is chiefly employed\r\nfor lighting purposes, lubricating and soap-making. The fine oils\r\nare substituted for, or mixed with, the olive-oils of commerce for\r\nsalad oils, and enter into the manufacture of oleo-margarine. After\r\nthese expressions of oil have been made, the meal is pressed into\r\ncakes and used for cattle-food and manurial purposes.\r\n\r\n=Classification and Description of the Groundnut Plant.=—The\r\ngroundnut belongs to the Sub-Order _Papilionaceæ_, of the Order\r\n_LEGUMINOSÆ_, and is termed _Arachis hypogæa_, Linn.\r\n\r\nThe plant cultivated in Senegal and the Gambia grows in a\r\nspreading form, with branches of from 12 to 18 inches in length,\r\nand possesses oval leaflets given off in double pairs. A large number\r\nof conspicuous yellow flowers appear from the upper leaf axils, but\r\nare not capable of fertilisation. Those springing from the lower\r\nleaf axils nearest the ground are small and generally hidden, but\r\nproduce fruitful pods. After fertilisation the stems of these flowers\r\nbecome elongated, and are directed downwards, forcing the ovary\r\ninto the ground, in which it commences to swell to the mature size,\r\nfrequently penetrating to a depth of two inches beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is a pale straw-coloured, irregularly-cylindrical pod,\r\nwith the surface of the shell pitted and longitudinally ribbed. In\r\nthe Gambian variety, which is identical with the common Senegalese\r\nkind, there are usually two kernels in each pod, but three or one\r\nare also found.\r\n\r\nThe plant is of doubtful origin, but it is generally supposed that\r\nit may have been introduced into Africa from Brazil (where the\r\ngenus _Arachis_ is well represented) nearly four centuries ago,\r\nby the Portuguese slave-traders.\r\n\r\nAbout 1840 groundnuts began to attract the attention of European\r\nmanufacturers, on account of the value of the oil obtained from\r\nthem, and, in common with the Senegalese, the Gambian natives were\r\ninduced to undertake cultivation upon a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe nuts grown in the Gambia and in Saloum, in the French territory\r\nadjoining on the north, are classed as of second quality; those from\r\nCayor and Rufisque holding the first, and those from the Casamance\r\nand Portuguese Guinea the third, places.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are sown upon ridges with flattened tops, and\r\nthe crop occupies the ground for about four months—July to\r\nOctober—corresponding to the period of heavy rainfall in the\r\ncountry. When the branches commence to wither, the whole plant\r\nis carefully pulled up, so that the pods, which are then mature,\r\nremain attached. The plants are then stacked in the fields, and\r\nare often covered over with the leaves of the fan-palm. The green\r\nparts dry into a hay, which, when the pods have been beaten out,\r\nis used as horse-fodder. The advent of rain after stacking often\r\ndoes great damage to the crop, but the occurrence is so rare that\r\nit has been found difficult to induce the native to take common\r\nprecautions against it. During the last two years, however, the\r\nGovernment have taken steps to enforce a regulation with regard to\r\nthis, and in consequence drains are now generally cut around the\r\nstacks, and coverings of palm-leaves are left on until the nuts\r\nare ready to be beaten out.\r\n\r\nIn the Jolah country raised platforms are constructed for stacking\r\nthis crop as well as others. After the nuts have been beaten out\r\nfrom the dried plants, they are winnowed by allowing them to fall\r\nfrom a slight elevation in a gentle breeze.\r\n\r\nA good crop of nuts in the Gambia is estimated at about 44 bushels\r\nper acre, equivalent to over half a ton, but larger yields are\r\nfrequently obtained. The Government standard bushel is used\r\nthroughout the country, and may contain from 25 to 31 lbs. of\r\nundecorticated nuts.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made from time to time, to establish a\r\nthree-kernel nut instead of the two-kernel one, but the results\r\nobtained have not shown that any advantage could be gained in this\r\nway. Other varieties of nuts have been introduced and cultivated, but\r\nno extensive planting of new kinds has yet been found worth adoption.\r\n\r\nThe plant seldom suffers from severe attacks of disease, although a\r\nwhite fungus was prevalent in some localities in 1906. This affection\r\nwas termed “tio jarankaro” by the Mandingoes. In the succeeding\r\nyear it completely disappeared, and has not been reported to have\r\noccurred since. The extermination of this disease was doubtless in\r\na large measure due to the careful way in which the selection and\r\ndistribution of seed had been carried out. For several years the\r\nGovernment has been accustomed to purchase a certain quantity of\r\nthe best nuts each season, and to distribute these at sowing time\r\nto the cultivators, on credit. Without this precaution, in a season\r\nwhen the prices for nuts were high, the thriftless native would be\r\ninduced to sell every nut, reserving nothing for sowing the next\r\nyear. The system adopted is greatly appreciated by the cultivators\r\nand merchants alike, and has without doubt contributed largely\r\nto the prosperity of the country. Seed is not only interchanged,\r\nin this manner, with advantage between different districts, but\r\nfresh seed is sometimes also provided from Senegal.\r\n\r\nThe immigrant or “strange farmers” are generally welcomed by\r\nthe land-owners, who usually manage to lease them the fields which\r\nrequire the most cleaning. After the immigrant farmer has reaped\r\nhis groundnut crop, the field is left in a good state of tilth for\r\nthe owner to sow his guinea corn.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of ruinous competition among merchants at Bathurst\r\ninduced them to form a “combine” to regulate the buying price\r\nof nuts; the purchases being pooled and then divided according to\r\na fixed scale. A recent attempt to divert Gambian nuts to Senegal\r\nports for shipment, by the levy of an import tax at Marseilles,\r\nwas opposed by the French and British merchants alike, and the fear\r\nthat the produce might only be diverted to another destination led to\r\nits abandonment. For further information regarding the cultivation,\r\nvarieties and uses of groundnuts, see _Bulletin of the Imperial\r\nInstitute_, vol. viii. (1910), pp. 153-72.\r\n\r\n=RUBBER.=—A good quality of rubber is produced in the Jolah\r\ncountry, in particular, from _Landolphia Heudelotii_, an apocynaceous\r\nvine, which grows commonly in the grass lands of Fogni.\r\n\r\nThe vine is tapped by women, who, after digging a hole near\r\nthe root of the plant, make a number of transverse cuts upon the\r\nroot-stem. The latex flows rapidly from such cuts, and is coagulated\r\nby throwing salt water on the wound. The scrap rubber which forms\r\nis collected the following day, and the pieces are attached to\r\none another, forming an open sponge-like ball of a pinkish-white\r\ncolour. Sand is often present in these balls owing to the fallen\r\nlatex being added to the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUBBER VINE (_LANDOLPHIA HEUDELOTII_) AT KOTOO.\r\n\r\nFig. 4. p. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEARA RUBBER TREE (_MANIHOT GLAZIOVII_) AT BAKAU.\r\n\r\nFig. 5, p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUBBER TREE (_CASTILLOA ELASTICA_) AT KOTOO.\r\n\r\nFig. 6, p. 10.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the inhabitants themselves collecting rubber, natives\r\nbelonging to a tribe from Portuguese Guinea, called “Manjagos,”\r\ntravel through the country for the purpose; the rubber which\r\nthey obtain being sold in the French Colony to the south of the\r\nGambia. The “Manjagos” are said to make a semicircular cut upon\r\nthe thick vine-stems just above the ground, to induce the better\r\nflow of latex. This, they maintain, is not a destructive method,\r\nand that, as the root stock is uninjured, the plant continues to\r\nyield latex for a long time. At one time the rubber vine must have\r\nbeen plentiful, but the rush for it which occurred at the beginning\r\nof the present century has had the effect of exterminating it, except\r\nin the more inaccessible places. The export has declined and is now\r\ninsignificant. The plant is known to the Mandingoes as “Folio.”\r\nAn illustration is given showing this plant at Kotoo (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n_Landolphia florida_, Benth., is common in places similar to those\r\nwhere the last-mentioned vine occurs, but the latex is not used in\r\nany way to adulterate the good rubber, nor is inferior “paste”\r\nrubber made from it, as in other places in West Africa. _Ficus\r\nVogelii_, known as “Kobbo” (Mandingo), has recently been used\r\nfor extracting an inferior rubber, which has been shipped in small\r\nquantities. This tree is found growing in Bathurst as well as\r\nin many of the large towns, where it often attains a large size,\r\nand affords an excellent shade for native markets, etc. A view of\r\na tree in Bathurst is shown (Fig. 3). Information regarding the\r\ncomposition and value of the rubber of _Ficus Vogelii_ is given in\r\nthe _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. vii. (1909), p. 260.\r\n\r\nSome of the South American species of rubber trees have been planted\r\nat different places, but for the most part the climatic conditions\r\nhave proved unsuitable for their establishment. An exception to\r\nthis is the Ceara rubber (_Manihot Glaziovii_), large trees of\r\nwhich were to be seen in Bathurst and at Bakau, but in the latter\r\nlocality appear to have been cut down during recent years. It is\r\ngenerally acknowledged that Ceara rubber has not proved successful\r\nin plantations made in different parts of West Africa, for, although\r\nrubber of the finest quality can be easily prepared from the latex,\r\nthe tree furnishes an extremely inconstant yield of latex. In the\r\nGambia the tree reproduces readily, and, as far as can be judged,\r\nproduces a latex capable of being coagulated into good rubber. As\r\na shade tree it is recommended to be grown along public roads, and\r\nit might prove expedient in the country to make small experimental\r\nplantations, in the manner adopted in Togoland and elsewhere. By\r\nthis system, tapping is continued for a few years, and whole blocks\r\nof trees are cut out as they cease to yield latex—the seedlings\r\nwhich have sprung up beneath these trees being permitted to take\r\nthe place of the original trees. An illustration showing a Ceara\r\nrubber tree at Bakau is given (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nOne specimen of _Castilloa elastica_, of which a photograph is\r\ngiven (Fig. 6), is growing in the Kotoo farm, about 12 miles\r\nfrom Bathurst. This tree has not, so far, proved successful in\r\nWest Africa, and the example photographed is apparently in better\r\ncondition than those grown in the Botanic Gardens of the Gold Coast\r\nand Southern Nigeria.\r\n\r\n_Funtumia elastica_, the Lagos silk rubber tree, does not thrive in\r\nthe Gambia, and the rainfall has been found to be insufficiently\r\ndistributed for the cultivation of the Para rubber tree (_Hevea\r\nbrasiliensis_).\r\n\r\nThe observed facts point to the conclusion that further experimental\r\ntrials of certain species of rubber trees in the Gambia should\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n=BEESWAX.=—It will be observed that a large quantity of beeswax\r\nis annually exported, the quality of which is high. The native bee\r\nis a small form of _Apis mellifera_, var. _Adansonii_. It is found\r\nin a wild state forming nests in hollow trees or rock cavities. The\r\nMandingoes collect the wild swarms and confine them in basket-hives,\r\ncylindrical in form and sometimes plastered over with mud. These\r\nare placed in high trees or in abandoned huts. The wax is sold in a\r\ncrude form to the Bathurst merchants, who boil it down and strain\r\nit previous to shipment. The European market value of the cleaned\r\nwax is from £5 to £6 per cwt. A detailed description of methods\r\nfor the refining of wild bees’ wax for export is published in the\r\n_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. viii. (1910), pp. 23-31.\r\n\r\n=PALM KERNELS.=—The West African oil palm, _Elæis guineensis_,\r\nis found commonly in some parts, but the heads produced are small and\r\ncarry small fruits, containing little oil. This oil is used locally,\r\nand the kernels from the nuts alone are shipped. The palm is chiefly\r\nvalued for the production of palm wine, which is tapped from the\r\nbase of the fruiting stems into funnelled gourds, hung beneath the\r\nholes. The tree is apparently never felled for the purpose, and, by\r\nlimiting the amount of wine extracted, it survives for a long period.\r\n\r\n=COTTON.=—The Mandingoes and Jolahs cultivate cotton for making the\r\nyarn used in their native looms, in which they weave the strips of\r\ncloth called “pagns.” These strips are afterwards sewn together\r\nalong their lateral edges and made into gowns.\r\n\r\nThe native cotton plant varies somewhat in appearance. In Kommbo,\r\na long straggling form occurs, which is retained for two seasons\r\nto produce cotton, but in the Jolah country a small annual is most\r\nfrequently seen. The former is grown as a mixed crop and the latter\r\nin separate patches.\r\n\r\nIn quality, from the European spinner’s point of view, the\r\nMandingo cotton lint compares favourably with the commercial\r\ntype called “middling American” as far as length of staple\r\nis concerned, although it is not so white, nor is there so much\r\nsilkiness apparent. It has been rightly remarked that the native\r\nvariety, if properly cultivated, would probably give a better\r\nresult than would be obtained from the introduction of American\r\nseed. The Jolah cotton is short-stapled and woolly, though whiter\r\nthan the Mandingo. It would be more difficult to improve this kind\r\nsufficiently to suit the European demand.\r\n\r\nEgyptian cotton seed was tried in the Gambia about twenty years ago,\r\nand the variety was at first considered suitable; the cultivation\r\nwas, however, not proceeded with, owing to local difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles which hindered the development of cotton-growing in\r\nthe Gambia for export were the same as those experienced in Sierra\r\nLeone. The local demand for raw cotton precluded it from being\r\nobtained at a sufficiently low price to leave a margin of profit\r\nto exporters, and in addition to this, labour was not sufficiently\r\nabundant, nor were the natives familiar with labour-saving methods\r\nin cultivation. Attempts to establish an interest in the matter\r\nproduced a fair amount of raw cotton in 1904, but since that\r\nyear the exported quantity rapidly diminished and has now ceased\r\naltogether. For reports on the quality of the cotton produced in\r\nthe Gambia see Professor Dunstan’s _British Cotton Cultivation_\r\n(Colonial Reports—Miscellaneous Series, Cd. 3997, 1908), p. 26,\r\nand _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1921. Samples may be seen in the Imperial\r\nInstitute Collections.\r\n\r\n=GRAIN CROPS.=—No grain is exported, as owing to the work of the\r\nscanty population being so largely applied to the cultivation of\r\ngroundnuts, scarcely sufficient food-stuff is grown for their\r\nown requirements. Guinea-corn (_Sorghum vulgare_), the two\r\nmost important varieties of which are known as “Bassi” and\r\n“Kinto” in the Mandingo language, are commonly used for food,\r\nbut during recent years, owing to the repeated annual attacks on\r\nthe crop by _Aphis sorghi_, maize-growing was substituted in some\r\nparts of the country. White maize seed was obtained from Lagos,\r\nand yellow maize seed from the Canary Islands, but the grain is\r\nnot appreciated to the same extent as Guinea corn. _Pennisetum\r\ntyphoideum_, the large millet, of which the commonest variety is\r\nknown in Mandingo as “Sannio,” is alternated with Guinea corn or\r\nmaize, but is often badly affected by a “smut fungus” (_Ustilago\r\nsp._), which also attacks the “Kinto” variety of Guinea corn. A\r\nsmall grass is often grown in the millet fields, yielding a crop of\r\nfine seed which is made into flour for the preparation of a kind of\r\nporridge. This is termed “Findi” locally. Rice (_Oryza sativa_)\r\nis somewhat extensively grown in the swamp lands, but the success\r\nof the crop is very largely dependent on the distribution of the\r\nrainfall. Whole tracts of rice fields are destroyed in some years,\r\nowing to excessive floods, as no precautions are taken to guard\r\nagainst them. It is chiefly on account of the uncertainty of the\r\ngrain crops, that a large quantity of rice has to be imported\r\nannually to supplement that produced in the country. These imports\r\noften amount to six or seven thousand tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRUITS OF OIL PALMS, SIERRA LEONE.\r\n\r\nFig. 9, p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEET CASSAVA, WITH BAOBAB TREES, BAKAU.\r\n\r\nFig. 7, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIGO DYERS, McCARTHY ISLAND.\r\n\r\nFig. 8, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n=ROOT AND OTHER CROPS.=—Sweet cassava (_Manihot palmata_)\r\nis frequently planted as a terminal crop in the crude rotation\r\nemployed. This variety can be eaten without previously washing or\r\ncooking. An illustration of a cassava field is given (Fig. 7). Two or\r\nthree kinds of beans are planted, though not extensively in spite\r\nof a good local demand for them. Okra (_Hibiscus esculentus_),\r\ncultivated for the edible fruit pods, indigo (_Indigofera sp._)\r\nemployed for making the local blue dye, and tobacco (_Nicotiana\r\ntabacum_), are planted near houses. A photograph is given exhibiting\r\nthe different utensils required for the preparation of indigo,\r\nand cakes of the dried and fermented indigo stalks, in the form in\r\nwhich they are preserved, are shown suspended in the illustration\r\n(Fig. 8). The tobacco prepared is usually ground into snuff, in\r\nwhich form it is used for chewing as well as for smoking.\r\n\r\n=TANNING.=—Goat-skins are tanned in the manner similar to that\r\nemployed by the Haussas; _Acacia arabica_ pods being used in the\r\nprocess. The people who perform the work of preparing and working\r\nleather are termed “Korankos.” Red and black inks, purchased\r\nfrom the European merchants, are used for staining the leather,\r\nwhich is inferior to that produced in Northern Nigeria (see p. 142).\r\n\r\n=FIBRES.=—The country seems to be plentifully supplied with fibre\r\nplants in a wild state, chiefly belonging to different species of\r\n_Hibiscus_. These are of the jute class, and are used throughout the\r\ncountry for making native ropes. Indian jute (_Corchorus capsularis_)\r\nhas been tried experimentally at Kotoo, and excellent samples were\r\nobtained, but the quantity of fibre per acre turned out to be small,\r\nand the working proved to be too expensive.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of piassava, which had been abandoned for many\r\nyears, is said to have been taken up again by a British firm in\r\n1915. The fibre is obtained from the leaf sheath of a palm (_Raphia\r\nvinifera_) which grows plentifully along the banks of the Gambia\r\nin places. For further information see _Selected Reports from the\r\nImperial Institute_, Pt. I., Fibres, and _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1915.\r\n\r\n=TIMBER.=—There are no trees of commercial importance, accessible\r\nfor felling for export, although Gambian mahogany (_Khaya\r\nsenegalensis_) and Gambian rosewood (_Pterocarpus erinaceus_)\r\noccur in many parts of the country. In some remote districts the\r\nformer tree is said to attain large dimensions (_Bulletin of the\r\nImperial Institute_, vol. viii. (1910), p. 244).\r\n\r\n=TRADE.=—The following extracts from the Colonial Reports\r\nshow the diversion of destination of Gambian exports which has\r\noccurred in recent years. For this purpose groundnuts are regarded\r\nas representing the whole of the trade, of which they normally\r\nconstitute about 90 per cent.\r\n\r\n                PERCENTAGES OF EXPORTS FROM THE GAMBIA\r\n\r\n   Destination    1911  1912  1913  1914  1915  1916  1917\r\n\r\n  Great Britain   6·30  9·00  6·72  9·92  39·45 53·56 79·56\r\n   and British\r\n   Possessions\r\n\r\n  France and      84·80 76·00 59-10 79·34 48·60 36·58 20·35\r\n   French\r\n   Possessions\r\n\r\n  Holland         3·20  9·00  6·03    —     —   4·20    —\r\n\r\n  Germany           —   3·64  24·56 6·80    —     —     —\r\n\r\n  Denmark           —     —     —   1·99  7·68  5·63    —\r\n\r\n  Spain             —     —     —    ·35  4·24    —     —\r\n\r\n  Other countries 5·70  2·36  3·59  1·60  0·03  0·03  0·09\r\n                  -----------------------------------------\r\n                   100   100   100   100   100   100   100\r\n                  -----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be noted that Germany began to appear in the\r\nmarket in 1912, and, in 1913, had taken nearly one-quarter of the\r\noutput. This is probably accounted for by the rapid growth of the\r\nvegetable oil industry in Germany and the attempt on the part of\r\nHamburg crushers to capture the Gambia trade from Marseilles. It\r\nwill be seen that a proportionate decrease occurred in exports\r\nto French ports coincident with the increased shipments to German\r\nports. The European war put Germany out of the market, and in 1914\r\nFrance took nearly her normal share. In 1915 and 1916, however,\r\nGreat Britain felt the lack of imported vegetable oils to such\r\nan extent that factories for their extraction sprang up in the\r\ncountry; thus it is seen that in 1915 Great Britain took nearly\r\n40 per cent. against France’s 48½ per cent., and in 1916, Great\r\nBritain, for the first time in the last fifty years, took a larger\r\nportion of the Gambian groundnut crop than France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =GAMBIA & SIERRA LEONE=\r\n\r\n_Stanford’s Geogl. Estabt., London._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =SIERRA LEONE=\r\n\r\n\r\n=INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.= =Geographical Position.=—The Colony and\r\nProtectorate of Sierra Leone are bounded upon the north and west by\r\nFrench Guinea, and upon the east by Liberia. The Colony is confined\r\nto the hill country of the Sierra Leone Peninsula and Sherbro Island;\r\nthe remainder being Protectorate.\r\n\r\n=Area and Population.=—The area of the country according to\r\nthe Blue Book of 1911 is 31,000 sq. miles. The greater part is\r\nundulating, well watered and fairly fertile, traversed by short\r\nranges of mountains, mostly running north and south. The population\r\nof the Colony, by the census taken in 1911, was 75,572, and of the\r\nProtectorate 1,327,560.\r\n\r\n=Administrative Divisions.=—The country is divided into seven\r\nadministrative districts, two of which are in the Colony and\r\nfive in the Protectorate. The latter have been formed primarily\r\nin accordance with tribal settlements, due to the expediency of\r\nrecognising in each the native customary law; the exception to this\r\nis the Railway district, in which other considerations of greater\r\nimportance are involved.\r\n\r\n=Natural Features.=—Although the country is largely of a slightly\r\nundulating type, in the north a curious formation of hills exists, in\r\nthe Koinadugu district; each hill bearing a curiously-formed pinnacle\r\nof rock on its summit, and presenting a most striking appearance. The\r\nvalleys between these hills contain some of the richest soil found\r\nin the country. Farther north, above the 9th degree of latitude, the\r\ncountry is composed chiefly of grass land interspersed with stunted\r\ntrees. Approaching the coast, secondary forest or scrub occurs, which\r\nis constantly being cleared for farms; being so used for a year or\r\ntwo and then allowed to revert to “bush” for long periods.\r\n\r\n=Natives.=—The inhabitants of the Colony are chiefly the\r\ndescendants of liberated slaves from North America and the West\r\nIndies, but a number were rescued by British war-vessels from slave\r\nships, and represent races from all parts of West Africa. The\r\nlanguage adopted by these people is a “pidgin English” of a\r\npeculiar kind, and is easily understood after a few of the curious\r\nidiomatic phrases have been learnt.\r\n\r\nThe most important tribes are the Mendis, Timanis, Limbas and\r\nSherbros. These are followed in number by the Konnohs, Port Lokkos,\r\nSusus, Korankos, Bulloms, Krims, Yalunkas, Mandingoes, Gbemas,\r\nFoulahs, Gallinas or Veis and Gpakas. The Mendis are the largest\r\ntribe, and are entirely pagan; they cultivate in a wasteful manner\r\nand are otherwise improvident. The Timanis are more intelligent\r\nand careful, and the Veis, occupying the sea coast to the south,\r\nwho have recently adopted cocoa planting, are not only considered\r\nthe most intelligent, but, alone among West African natives, have\r\na written language.\r\n\r\n=Land Tenure.=—The land in the Colony is held by the Crown,\r\nand is granted on the authority of the Governor. All grants\r\nmade contain reservations with regard to roads and other public\r\nrequirements. The tenure of Crown lands is fee simple, but occupation\r\nis also sanctioned under squatters’ licence at a nominal rent,\r\nand the tenure is then in the nature of a tenancy at will. Under\r\nOrdinance No. 14 of 1886, real and personal property may be taken,\r\nacquired, held or disposed of by any alien in a manner similar to\r\nthat allowed to a British-born subject.\r\n\r\nFields or waste lands outside town or village limits in the Sierra\r\nLeone Peninsula and Sherbro Island must be taken up in lots of not\r\nless than 20, or more than 200, acres. Such lots are disposed of at\r\nauction, at an upset price of 4_s_. 2_d_. per acre in the former,\r\nand 8_s_. in the latter locality. Up to 1902 the question of land\r\ngrants in the Protectorate was unsettled, but arrangements may now\r\nbe come to with the chiefs for the lease of tracts of land for long\r\nperiods on an annual rental, agreed to between the applicant and\r\nthe tribal council; the title requiring the confirmation of the\r\nGovernment. According to native law, it is generally recognised\r\nthat the lands of a chiefdom are not the property of the chief,\r\nbut are held in trust by him for the tribe. A chief has no power\r\nto alienate any portion of the land of a chiefdom, or to grant to\r\nany one perpetual rights to any portion, but the lease of land by\r\nan arrangement with the tribal council, and with the approval of\r\nGovernment, should be satisfactory for all requirements with regard\r\nto legal title.\r\n\r\n=Labour.=—Plantations worked by chiefs at the instigation\r\nof Government are usually supplied with labour by the chief,\r\nalthough monetary assistance in the form of bonuses is occasionally\r\ngiven. Under such conditions experimental plantations of fibre,\r\nrubber, kola, etc., have been made. There is no fixed rate of pay\r\nfor labourers, but the usual wage for an adult man, when hired,\r\nis from 6_d_. to 1_s_. per day.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=—Throughout the country a shallow type of cultivation\r\nis common, and one in which the bush stumps and roots are not\r\nremoved. The seeds of a number of different kinds of agricultural\r\ncrops are generally mixed together before being sown broadcast over\r\nthe lightly scraped soil of the burnt bush area.\r\n\r\nThe object of retaining the bush stumps and roots in the fields\r\nis that, after two or three years of cultivation, the bush may\r\nbe easily reinstated, and again after ten or fifteen years, when\r\ncut down and burnt, it furnishes a supply of wood ash for the\r\nfertilisation of the field. This application of ash constitutes\r\nthe only form of artificial renovation which the soil ever receives.\r\n\r\nRecently experiments have been made in the presence of natives,\r\nin order to show the advantages of deep cultivation. To effect\r\nthis, without the employment of ploughs, the fork kodalli hoe,\r\nrecommended by the writer, has been introduced and generally\r\nadopted. The substantial increase in the production of their rice\r\nfields obtained by the use of this implement made a fortunate\r\nimpression among the natives.\r\n\r\nThe native agricultural implements consist of a straight-handled,\r\nnarrow-bladed hoe called “kari” (Mendi), or “katala”\r\n(Timani), and one formed from an angled stick with a charred point,\r\ncalled “baowe” (Mendi), or “kalal” (Timani). This last is\r\nused for drilling. In addition to these, a large broad-bladed hoe,\r\ncalled “karu wai” (Mendi), or “katala kabana” (Timani), is\r\nemployed for cleaning out weeds and scraping the soil surface; the\r\nlatter being the only cultivation the growing crop receives. These\r\nimplements are illustrated below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. “KARI” (MENDI), “KATALA” (TIMANI).\r\n\r\nB. “KAKU WAI” (MENDI), “KATALA KABANA” (TIMANI),\r\n\r\nC. “BAOWE” (MENDI), “KALAL” (TIMANI).]\r\n\r\n=Agricultural Schools, etc.= _Chiefs’ Sons’ College._—In 1906\r\na college for the sons of chiefs was established at Bo, and it was\r\nintended that, in addition to the ordinary course of instruction,\r\nthe rudiments of improved agriculture should be taught. This\r\nwas subsequently found to interfere with the teaching of other\r\nsubjects which were considered more necessary, and was abandoned in\r\nconsequence. The omission of agricultural training from the course\r\ndid not preclude the scholars from cultivating small patches of\r\nvegetables for their own use, upon ground allowed to them for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Agricultural College._—In 1908 the erection of an\r\nAgricultural College was commenced at Mabang, under the terms of\r\nthe will of Mr. Thomas, a native who bequeathed a large sum of\r\nmoney to be devoted to this purpose. The College was expected to be\r\ncompleted in June 1910, when a commencement of lectures and general\r\ninstruction was to be made. Scholarships and some official control\r\nwere provided for by the terms of the trust, but the project was\r\nnever developed, and the buildings were not even completed.\r\n\r\n=Principal Crops.=—The most important food crop is rice, but\r\ntwo varieties of maize are also cultivated for local consumption;\r\none of these is quick maturing, and is probably identical with the\r\nwhite variety which is exported from Lagos, from which country it\r\nis said to have been introduced into Sierra Leone. The other kind\r\nis of slower growth, and bears a yellow grain. Yams, sweet potatoes,\r\nand cassava are grown, especially where there is a heavy rainfall.\r\n\r\n=Forest Products.=—Besides the agricultural crops, the forests\r\nyield palm oil and kernels, and kola nuts are planted for the\r\nmuch appreciated seed which their pods contain. The latter nut is\r\nsaid to have a stimulating effect, and to allay hunger and thirst\r\nwhen chewed. The nut is in such great demand throughout Northern\r\nAfrica that a large trade exists between Sierra Leone and the coast\r\ncountries to the north.\r\n\r\nThe more important exported products are accorded the foremost\r\npositions in the following account.\r\n\r\n\r\n=OIL PALM.= =Localities and the Influence of Position.=—_Elæis\r\nguineensis_ is found generally throughout the country from the\r\nsea-board towards the interior, diminishing in those districts where\r\nthe climate becomes drier or where rocky and mountainous tracts\r\nintervene. In places, owing, doubtless, to the wasteful methods\r\nof treatment and the carelessness in burning the “bush” for\r\nfarms, extensive areas without palms are occasionally met with,\r\neven where the soil and climatic conditions are not unfavourable to\r\ntheir growth. In the extreme north, where the rainfall diminishes,\r\nthe tree is only found in the vicinity of streams. The most suitable\r\nsituation for growth seems to be one in which the soil is generally\r\nrather moist, although swampy, ill-drained land is not favourable. In\r\nthose parts of the country where a gravelly laterite appears as a\r\nsurface soil over a deep substratum of syenite, trees may often be\r\nmet with in considerable numbers, but it is observed that the trunks\r\nof such trees do not acquire the same thickness as those growing in\r\na damper and lighter soil. It is probable, although no experiments\r\nhave yet been made affording direct evidence for the conclusion,\r\nthat the fertility and yield of fruits of the trees growing upon\r\nthe flat lands are greater than those established upon the higher\r\nundulating country because they are subject to less wash and more\r\nnatural irrigation. It is also quite possible that the variety of\r\npalm fruit produced in the former places will be found to furnish\r\nbetter commercial results. No distinct varieties are, however,\r\nrecognised by the natives, although distinctive names are applied\r\nto the same fruit in different stages of development.\r\n\r\nThe oil palm does not appear to be able to thrive in heavy forest,\r\nand in a natural state occupies open valleys with low undergrowth,\r\nbut upon the clearance of primary forest it soon becomes established.\r\n\r\nThe seeds or nuts, which are large and heavy, are distributed by\r\nthe agency of frugivorous birds and mammals. The grey parrot, for\r\nexample, may be observed extracting the ripe fruits from the heads\r\nor picking them from the ground where they have fallen, and, after\r\nconveying these to a convenient tree, carefully removing the oily\r\npericarp before dropping the nut in a new position. Monkeys doubtless\r\nconvey the fruits to even greater distances in their cheek-pouches.\r\n\r\nOwing to the presence of rocky and swampy strips of country in\r\nthe Protectorate, and the direction in which farm fires have been\r\ncarried by the prevailing winds, the distribution of palms has been\r\nthought to assume the character of “belts,” defined by fairly\r\nwell-marked boundaries. When looked into more closely, however,\r\nthe distribution appears to be better described as consisting of\r\ndense patches linked sometimes by almost unrecognisable chains of\r\nwidely scattered trees, and often broken into by short ranges of\r\nhills which are completely destitute of palms.\r\n\r\nThe patches referred to may bear 500 palm trees to the acre, and\r\nthese may represent 80 to 100 per cent. of the total tree-growth\r\non the patch. The area of such a patch may be roughly estimated at\r\nfrom ¼ acre to 15 sq. miles, or even more, but it should be added\r\nthat, where such extensive tracts as these occur, the difficulties\r\nof transport and the scarcity of the population have constituted\r\nobstacles to working, and to the means of preserving the trees. Oil\r\npalms near Mafokoyia are shown in the picture (Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL PALMS (_ELÆIS GUINEENSIS_), MAFOKOYIA.\r\n\r\nFig. 10, p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE COLLECTING OIL PALM FRUIT, BLAMA.\r\n\r\nFig 11, p. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOLA TREE AT MANO.\r\n\r\nFig. 12, p. 29.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a young tree is that of a thick stem throwing\r\nout annulate series of long feathery leaf fronds, upon petioles,\r\nwhich bear roughly-formed spines. As the tree increases in height\r\nthe lower petioles are shed, and the trunk assumes a narrower but\r\nmore regular form; indistinct rings being traceable, formed by the\r\nbases of the fallen leaf stems. A mature tree will measure about one\r\nfoot in diameter at four feet from the ground, and at the ground\r\nsurface the diameter will be two and a half to nearly three times\r\nas much. The male flowers are collected in the form of a number\r\nof tassel-like pendants, springing from a common stalk, and one\r\nsuch bunch is usually found above and upon each side of the female\r\ninflorescence. Both sexes of flowers usually occur upon the trees,\r\nbut the natives recognise the existence of a non-fruiting tree,\r\nand one which only produces male flowers. The number of fruit heads\r\nand the weight of these vary according to the position, age, and\r\ntreatment of the tree. An idea may be given of the fruitfulness of\r\ntrees, from the accounts obtained from natives in different parts\r\nof the country. The palm has two fruiting seasons, one during the\r\ndry weather and another during the rainy season, the latter being\r\ngenerally the lighter crop. It is estimated that a tree in full\r\nbearing will yield from twelve to twenty fruiting heads in one year,\r\neach of a fairly large size. A younger tree may only produce four\r\nto eight heads, but usually of a larger size; and a tree of only\r\nfive or six years old may give about the same number of heads, but\r\nof smaller dimensions. From very old trees small heads with fruits\r\nof a diminished size are obtained. The weight of a moderately large\r\nhead will be about thirty pounds, and will contain about twelve\r\nhundred fruits weighing roughly 23 lbs. An illustration showing\r\ntwo fruiting heads is given (Fig. 9).\r\n\r\nThe ripe fruiting heads are gathered by a man using a climbing sling,\r\nwith which he encircles the tree and his waist, and by means of a\r\nskilful manipulation of the part in contact with the trunk and remote\r\nfrom the body, he proceeds to ascend the tree rapidly, almost as\r\nthough walking up it. On reaching the crown, a number of dead leaves\r\nhave to be removed in order to get at the fruit stem. These are cut\r\nby means of a “cutlass” or “machete,” which the climber\r\ncarries, and are thrown to the ground. Only one head ripens at a\r\ntime upon each tree, and the time occupied in climbing and cutting\r\nout the fruit head is estimated at about eight minutes. A photograph\r\nshowing a native climbing a palm tree is reproduced (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\nBoth the Mendi and Timani races distinguish the fruit, at different\r\nperiods during the advance towards maturity, by special names given\r\nwith regard to the appearance. Identifications of the same series\r\nof fruits by different individuals have shown that these names are\r\nwidely used.\r\n\r\nAlthough it will be seen that in the Gold Coast and Nigeria the\r\nnatives recognise a number of different varieties of fruit, this does\r\nnot appear to be the case in Sierra Leone. The thin-shelled forms,\r\nso well known to the natives of the former countries, appear unknown,\r\nexcept around Sherbro, where there are a few trees recognised as\r\nproductive of this type of fruit. In the appearance of the mature\r\nfruit, the presence or absence of black at the apex seems to be\r\nof equally common occurrence, but no importance is attached to\r\nthis feature.\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Leone form appears to be at a disadvantage with regard\r\nto the proportion of oily pericarp covering the nut, as well as in\r\nthe great thickness of its shell. Comparing it with the varieties\r\nobtained in the Gold Coast, it is probably nearest to, if not\r\nidentical with, that called “Abe pa.”\r\n\r\nWhen the percentage of oil extracted from the fruit of the Sierra\r\nLeone trees is compared with that from other parts of West Africa,\r\nit at once becomes apparent that the amount is small. The results\r\nof three series of experiments, made in different parts of the\r\ncountry, showed that the fibrous pericarp, which contains the oil,\r\nconstituted only about 30 per cent. of the whole, the nut containing\r\nthe kernel being large and approximating 70 per cent. Palm oil\r\nextracted by native methods gave 1·201, 5·47, 5·637, and 8·326\r\nper cent. respectively in four tests. If these results are compared\r\nwith the extractions of oil from the several Gold Coast varieties,\r\nthe deficiency is very marked. Compare _Bulletin of the Imperial\r\nInstitute_, vol. vii. (1909), pp. 364-71.\r\n\r\nA close examination of the local fruit shows that the outer fibrous\r\nportion or pericarp, which alone contains the palm oil, is very thin,\r\nwhereas the hard shell surrounding the kernel is thick. The kernel\r\nrepresents about 15 per cent. of the total weight of the fruit,\r\nand is largely exported from the country for the extraction of\r\nanother kind of oil.\r\n\r\n=Small Export of Oil compared with Kernels.=—The proportionately\r\nlarger weight of kernel than of palm oil capable of extraction,\r\naccounts for the large quantities of kernels exported compared with\r\npalm oil. As an example of this, it may be mentioned that in the\r\nyear 1906 Sierra Leone exported only 12½ gallons of palm oil to\r\neach ton of kernels, whereas Southern Nigeria figures for the same\r\nyear showed 142 gallons of oil per ton of kernels. Since this date,\r\nup to the beginning of the war, a comparison of the annual exports\r\nof oil and kernels shows a fluctuation between about 12 and 19\r\ngallons of pericarp oil for every ton of kernels; the latter still\r\nremaining disproportionately high.\r\n\r\n=Proposal to introduce New Varieties.=—Since it has begun to\r\nbe realised that the local variety of palm is probably constantly\r\ninferior as an oil producer to some of the varieties found farther\r\nto the south, it has been suggested that some of the forms, with\r\na thicker fibrous pericarp and a thin-shelled kernel, should be\r\nintroduced and planted upon an extensive scale. It is assumed that\r\nby doing so, a better type would become established. Experiments\r\nmade in the Kamerun show, however, that the progeny of palms\r\nhaving a thin-shelled fruit (Lisombe) do not necessarily retain\r\ntheir important characters. Dr. Strunk has suggested that, in the\r\nvariety mentioned, the characters are not fixed or susceptible of\r\ntransmission, but the experiments are not considered as yielding\r\nconclusive evidence, and it is advisable that experimental plots\r\nshould be planted with the more useful forms in Sierra Leone and\r\nelsewhere, the seed being obtained from artificially fertilised\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n=Improvements in the Local Manufacture.=—During recent years\r\ngreat efforts have been made by the Administration to increase the\r\nexports of both palm oil and kernels by opening up the previously\r\nrather inaccessible areas in which palm trees were found growing\r\nalmost untouched. The first step in this direction was the extension\r\nof the Sierra Leone Railway line from Boia, a small village just\r\nbeyond the Headquarters District boundary, to Mafokoyia, lying a\r\nshort distance to the north. From here a road was made eastwards\r\ntowards Yonnibannah, passing through country fairly well studded\r\nwith oil palms. Later from Yonnibannah the objective of the railway\r\nbecame Baga, a town on the Maybole river, again to the north. At\r\nthe present time this line has reached Kamabai, at the foot of the\r\nKoinadugu mountains and to the west of Bumban, passing the town of\r\nMakump on its way there. The whole of this route has been chosen\r\nin order to make the oil palm regions more accessible, and the\r\nincrease in exports of both oil and kernels between 1907 and 1913\r\nis almost entirely attributable to this development.\r\n\r\nNot only was it desirable to open up new areas from which palm\r\nfruits could be gathered, but, owing to the deficiency of pericarp\r\noil shipped from the country in comparison with palm kernels,\r\nit was thought that, by the introduction of improved methods\r\nfor extracting the pericarp oil, more of this commodity might be\r\nobtainable in the future.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of working a large area both experimentally and\r\ncommercially for oil extraction _in situ_, attracted Messrs. Lever\r\nBrothers, who installed ample mechanical apparatus at Yonnibannah\r\nin 1914. The Government had granted this firm a concession to work\r\nseveral hundred square miles on the understanding that the local\r\ntraders and merchants were not thereby to be debarred from buying the\r\nhand-prepared oil from the natives as before. The scheme was intended\r\nto demonstrate the advantages of mechanical means of extraction over\r\nthose of hand power; and it was thought that, by the introduction\r\nof these greater facilities for dealing with the oil palm products,\r\nlabour would be liberated and would be employed to a greater extent\r\nin the less heavy and more remunerative direction of plantation\r\nand field work. Messrs. Lever Brothers’ factory was one designed\r\nto be equipped both from a mechanical and research standpoint,\r\nand a special shunting yard on the railway was leased to the firm\r\nby the Government to deal with the anticipated work. The project\r\nseemed so promising that local firms were contemplating following\r\nMessrs. Lever Brothers’ example in other localities. The whole\r\nscheme was, however, abandoned after a short trial; Messrs. Lever\r\nBrothers having probably discovered two facts in connection with the\r\noil palm industry in Sierra Leone which had been lost sight of. The\r\nfirst is that the pericarp of the common type of palm fruit found in\r\nSierra Leone, as pointed out in the first edition of this book, is\r\nvery thin and therefore contains very little oil, and that the shell\r\nof the nuts in this thin-pericarped fruit is extremely thick. The\r\ncommon Sierra Leone kind is therefore of less economic value both\r\nin respect to pericarp oil and kernel contents than the common kind\r\nfound in the Gold Coast, Nigeria and Kamerun. The second point is\r\nthat the Mendis and Timanis occupying this part of the Protectorate\r\nare a lower type and generally poorer workers by comparison with\r\nthe Fanti tribes of the Gold Coast or the Yorubas of Nigeria.\r\n\r\nOne explanation given for the failure of Messrs. Lever Brothers’\r\neffort in Sierra Leone was that they did not offer a sufficiently\r\nhigh price for the oil palm fruit heads to induce the natives to\r\ncollect and carry them to the factory. As the chiefs and villagers\r\nsaw that by selling the fruits to the factory the main occupation of\r\ntheir wives (the preparation of palm oil and the cracking of nuts\r\nfor the extraction of palm kernels) would be taken away, they were\r\nsaid to be averse to the establishment of a new condition of enforced\r\nidleness, which would impose greater difficulties on them of keeping\r\ntheir wives in order. The offer by the factory to return the nuts\r\nfor cracking in the villages, did not dispose of this difficulty,\r\nas the villagers only saw in it an arrangement involving them in\r\nextra transport. Messrs. Lever Brothers have now transferred their\r\nwork to the Belgian Congo, where, by reason of the better type of\r\npalm fruit commonly obtainable, the conditions are more satisfactory\r\nfor the development of the mechanical extraction of palm oil on a\r\ncommercial scale, and where the inhabitants are less independent\r\nand more accustomed to co-operate with European enterprise.\r\n\r\n=Export Figures.=—The average annual export of palm oil and\r\nkernels for the first nine years of the century, and the annual\r\ntotal of the subsequent ten years are given:\r\n\r\n                 Palm oil    Palm kernels\r\n  Year            Gallons       Tons\r\n  1900-1908 Av.   303,790      26,630\r\n  1909            851,998      42,897\r\n  1910            645,339      43,031\r\n  1911            725,648      42,892\r\n  1912            728,509      50,751\r\n  1913            617,088      49,201\r\n  1914            436,144      35,915\r\n  1915            481,576      39,624\r\n  1916            557,751      45,316\r\n  1917            543,111      58,020\r\n  1918            260,442      40,816\r\n\r\n=RUBBER.=—Until 1907 the African tree rubber (_Funtumia elastica_)\r\nhad not been recorded from any part of the country, although its\r\ncongener, _F. africana_, was found everywhere. A number of trees\r\nof the first-named species have been recently discovered in the\r\nPanguma and Gola forests, and have been carefully examined. The\r\nlatex, from trees tapped in the former locality, yielded a good\r\nquality of rubber when boiled with three volumes of water.\r\n\r\n=Native Method of Preparation.=—The tree is known to the Mendis as\r\n“Gboi-gboi,” and in order to obtain the latex it is customary\r\nto fell the tree, afterwards ringing it at intervals of about\r\none foot. The latex, which flows, is collected in leaf cups or\r\nother receptacles, and is heated in an iron pot. When in a state of\r\nsemi-coagulation, induced by heat, it is poured upon plantain leaves,\r\nplaced on the ground. Another plantain leaf is then used to cover\r\nthe mass, which is stamped out with the feet into a rough sheet. The\r\nsheet is hung up to dry in a hut, in which it obtains the benefit\r\nof the fumes from the wood fires used by the occupants. The next\r\nprocess is to cut the sheet into strips, which are subsequently\r\nwound into large oval balls and enter the Freetown market under\r\nthe name of “Manoh twist.”\r\n\r\nOwing to the wasteful method of tapping the trees, the species has\r\nbeen exterminated in many places, and the local Government have\r\nhad under consideration the formulation of an ordinance to prevent\r\nthe continuance of such destruction. As the existing trees are\r\nnow practically only found in the dense forests near the Liberian\r\nfrontier, and are probably widely scattered over a large area,\r\nit will prove a difficult matter to enforce any regulations with\r\nregard to collection.\r\n\r\n=Vine Rubber: Method of Preparation.=—_Landolphia owariensis_,\r\nvar. _Jenje_, is said to be the species of vine from which the\r\nSierra Leone “Red Nigger” rubber is obtained. The Mendi name\r\nfor the plant is “Djenje.” A very destructive method is usually\r\nemployed in the preparation of the rubber. The vine is cut down and\r\nthe roots dug out, both of which are cut into small pieces and soaked\r\nin water for several weeks. The bark is then removed, and the wood is\r\npounded and washed repeatedly until a reddish mass of rubber remains,\r\nwhich usually contains a large amount of woody matter. This is sold\r\nin the form of balls. It is less common for the native to tap the\r\nvine and to coagulate the latex upon the wound with the addition\r\nof salt or lime juice, but this is occasionally done, and balls of\r\nscrap rubber collected in this way are sold in some localities.\r\n\r\nAnother vine (_Clitandra laxiflora_), which yields an inferior\r\nrubber by means of boiling the latex, is termed “Jawe” by the\r\nMendis. This was at first considered to be _Clitandra Manni_, but\r\nmore recent investigation has proved that _C. Manni_, although called\r\nby the same native name, produces a latex incapable of coagulation.\r\n\r\n=The Quality of Indigenous Rubbers and the Export.=—The prices\r\nobtained for Sierra Leone rubbers compare favourably with those of\r\nthe other British West African countries. Funtumia rubber, which\r\nis generally largely adulterated in the Gold Coast and Nigeria,\r\nis apparently not so in Sierra Leone, when prepared in the form of\r\n“Manoh twist.” The vine rubber, made from the scrap, is also of\r\ngood quality, and the root rubber is not inferior to that shipped\r\nfrom the other countries. The trade of Sierra Leone is, however,\r\nsmall, and it is probable that the larger part of that exported\r\nfrom Freetown is obtained from the adjoining countries of Liberia\r\nand French Guinea. The export of rubber declined since 1906, when\r\nit amounted to 107 tons, to only 6 tons in 1913, while in 1916\r\nand 1917 none was exported. The composition and quality of Sierra\r\nLeone rubbers is given in the _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. iv. (1906), p. 29; vol. vi. (1908), p. 24; vol. viii. (1910),\r\np. 16; and vol. xii. (1914), p. 371.\r\n\r\n=Rubber Plantations.=—No plantations of Funtumia rubber have\r\nbeen made although small plots have been planted with the South\r\nAmerican Para tree (_Hevea brasiliensis_) on an experimental\r\nscale at different times and in various parts of the country and a\r\nmixed plantation of rubber, cocoa, coffee and fruit has been made\r\nnear Waterloo. Up to 1909, it should be remarked, the work was\r\nin the hands of the Agricultural Service, but from 1910, on the\r\nformation of the Forestry Department as well as the reorganisation\r\nof an Agricultural Department, all forest and plantation work was\r\ntransferred to the first-named Department. No plantation rubber\r\nhas yet reached the commercial stage, although further trials are\r\nstill in progress, and much experience has been gained.\r\n\r\nA few Para trees were planted at the beginning of the present century\r\nin the Botanic Gardens at Freetown, but the locality was found\r\nunsuitable, and the trees grew slowly and yielded unsatisfactorily. A\r\nsmall plantation was made at Moyamba by Madam Yoko, the late chief of\r\nthe Mendis, and was well looked after until she died, since when it\r\nseems to have been somewhat neglected. At Mano, the chief of the town\r\nmade a good plantation in 1906, and, as the locality was apparently\r\nwell selected, the trees have shown satisfactory growth. Small plots\r\nhave been put out under Para at the Roman Catholic Mission station\r\nat Serabu, at Segbwema, Tinainahun and the Bo school, with variable\r\nsuccess, in accordance with the cultivation and care bestowed on\r\nthe plants. Except in the gravelly positions the tree succeeds well.\r\n\r\n_Landolphia owariensis_ and _L. Heudelotii_ have been planted in\r\nforested patches in different parts of the country, the supervision\r\nof such planting having been entrusted to a native who had seen\r\nsimilar work performed by the French authorities in the neighbouring\r\ncolony. Near Batkanu, a few plants can still be seen.\r\n\r\n=KOLA NUTS.=—The importance of the kola nut in West Africa\r\nis very high. Sierra Leone produces generally a better quality,\r\nfor local consumption and export, than other countries. The kola\r\ntrees (_Kola acuminata_ and _K. vera_) do not, however, occur in a\r\nwild state in the country, and the whole produce is obtained from\r\nplantations, which are to be seen near almost every village in the\r\nmoist region. A photograph is given showing a kola tree at Mano\r\n(Fig. 12). The destination of the exported kola is chiefly Bathurst\r\n(Gambia), Dakar (Senegal), Bissao (Portuguese Guinea), and to a small\r\nextent Dahomey. The exports of this commodity in recent years are\r\ngiven below as well as their average annual values per ton, which,\r\nas will be seen, exhibit great fluctuation.\r\n\r\n         Tons    Valued at  Equal to £ per ton\r\n  1906   1,155   £104,084         £90\r\n  1907   1,374   £113,674         £83\r\n  1908   1,162   £108,895         £94\r\n  1909   1,320   £153,848        £116\r\n  1910   1,508   £191,878        £127\r\n  1911   1,597   £194,260        £121\r\n  1912   1,649   £276,473        £167\r\n  1913   1,865   £328,003        £176\r\n  1914   1,924   £279,185        £145\r\n  1915   2,041   £233,388        £119\r\n  1916   2,484   £302,720        £122\r\n  1917   1,702   £321,105        £188\r\n  1918   2,302   £397,726        £173\r\n\r\nKola nuts are second only to palm kernels in Sierra Leone in\r\nimportance as an export, although they are practically entirely\r\nconsigned to other coast ports; an insignificant amount of dried\r\nkolas only being destined for Europe.\r\n\r\n=RED PEPPER.=—_Capsicum annuum_ and _C. frutescens_ are both\r\ngrown among the multitude of plants, the seeds of which are mixed\r\nand broadcasted in the farms; but whereas most of the other plants\r\nare annuals, these are left in the ground for two years or more,\r\nand yield almost continuous crops during that period. The country\r\nof origin of these plants is probably South America, but the date\r\nof their introduction is unknown.\r\n\r\nBeside the extensive local use of the pods, the export statistics\r\nof 1909 show that 41 tons were shipped.\r\n\r\n=GINGER.=—_Zingiber officinale_ is not found in a wild state\r\nin Africa, but has been widely introduced throughout the tropical\r\nportions, although in Sierra Leone, alone among the West African\r\ncountries, has it reached the important position of an export.\r\n\r\nOwing to the defective methods of agriculture employed in the Colony,\r\nwhere for the most part ginger is cultivated, the roots or rhizomes\r\ndo not attain a large size, and, in consequence, present great\r\ndifficulties in decortication.\r\n\r\nThe common native method of preparation is to rub the washed and\r\npartially dried rhizomes in sand, and then to dry them more or less\r\ncompletely in the sun. The effect of this treatment is to remove a\r\nsmall portion of the outer skin from those prominences which come\r\ninto contact with the sandy surface more readily, the depressions\r\nbeing left untouched. The native has found that the weight of the\r\nprepared ginger is increased by the adhesion of sand, and therefore\r\nprefers to employ this method to that of using a knife. The result\r\nis a very inferior product.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years attempts have been made among the ginger\r\ngrowers to deal directly with the European buyers, and a Farmers’\r\nAssociation was formed with this object in view. Government\r\nassistance was obtained on the assurance that better methods of\r\ncultivation and preparation would be adopted, and this was done\r\nto a certain extent, but greater dependence seems to have been\r\nplaced upon the supposed advantage to be obtained from shipping\r\nginger of the usual inferior quality, without it passing through\r\nthe local merchants’ hands. The result was, that a small quantity\r\nof selected ginger was sold at a good price, and a large quantity\r\nof common grade obtained a lower price than previously.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments have shown that good results can be obtained with\r\nginger in Sierra Leone if care be taken to deep-hoe the ground and\r\nthen plant out the selected eyes from clean rhizomes. The custom\r\nof attempting to grow a crop in hard laterite gravel without proper\r\ncultivation is the chief cause of the malformed and small rhizomes\r\nusually obtained in native cultivation. Under improved conditions a\r\ncrop of five tons per acre of good quality ginger has been procured.\r\n\r\n=Export Trade.=—The following amounts of ginger have been shipped\r\nduring the last decade:\r\n\r\n         Tons    Value           Tons    Value\r\n  1906     579   10,879   1913   2,048   35,468\r\n  1907     618   11,578   1914   1,213   15,639\r\n  1908     637   11,871   1915     567    8,091\r\n  1909     722   14,147   1916     971   25,814\r\n  1910   1,093   33,288   1917   1,136   25,863\r\n  1911   1,692   44,668   1918   1,576   39,306\r\n  1912   2,200   44,864\r\n\r\nIt is reported that, owing to the decline in price paid for\r\nSierra Leone ginger in 1913, about one-third of the crop was left\r\nunharvested, and that the depreciation experienced was due to the\r\ncompetition from other sources of a better marketed product. It would\r\nbe a pity if the promising opportunity of the country to become\r\nestablished as a large producer of ginger were altogether lost,\r\nowing to the want of a little care in cultivation and preparation\r\nof the product for the market.\r\n\r\nThe plant is essentially suited to certain parts of the Colony and\r\nProtectorate and is not subject to any serious diseases, the only\r\nrecorded one being a fungus which attacks the rhizomes and causes\r\nyellowing of the leaves. This can be prevented from spreading if\r\nthe plants be removed and burned as soon as the signs of attack\r\nare apparent on them.\r\n\r\n=FIBRES.= =Jute Class.=—In the last few years several fibre plants\r\nindigenous to the country have been experimented with at the Imperial\r\nInstitute, in order to ascertain whether any were capable of being\r\nexported for use as substitutes for Indian jute.\r\n\r\n_Honckenya ficifolia_, known by the Timani name of “Napunti,” a\r\nplant which occurs in great profusion in the swamps and low lands,\r\nyields a fibre of excellent quality, but owing to the difficulties\r\nexperienced in the extraction of it, further experiments are\r\nnecessary to devise a means by which it can be economically\r\nprepared. The analyses of the fibre from this plant which have been\r\nmade at the Imperial Institute (see _Selected Reports from the\r\nImperial Institute_, Part I. [Cd. 4588], Fibres, p. 40) are very\r\nsatisfactory, and this, combined with the fact that the natural\r\nsupply of the plant is very large in districts which are quite\r\nuseless for agricultural purposes, renders it important that the\r\nmethods of extraction should be more carefully studied.\r\n\r\nAmong the other fibres of this class which have shown promise,\r\n_Hibiscus quinquelobus_, to which the Mendis give the name of\r\n“Korwey,” is found in a wild state in variable profusion\r\nthroughout the country. Unlike the last, which produces erect stems\r\ngrowing close together, this plant has stems of an almost scandent\r\ncharacter, growing under the shade of moderately large trees and\r\nperforating the upper branches, so that the flowering stems are\r\noften seen fifteen feet or more above the ground. Under cultivation\r\nthe experiments seemed to show that the elongated character of the\r\nstems was not maintained, and this defect requires to be remedied if\r\nthe fibre is to be prepared upon a commercial scale. The extraction\r\nis easily done by retting, and experimental shipments to Europe of\r\nseveral tons have shown that the product is quite marketable and\r\nis classed with, or a little below, medium jutes (_ibid._ p. 39).\r\n\r\nRecently experiments were carried out in the extraction of fibre\r\nfrom _Hibiscus esculentus_, the “okra” of tropical countries. A\r\nspecimen of the fibre having been examined at the Imperial Institute\r\nand favourably reported upon (_ibid._ p. 35), a plantation was made\r\nat Kangahun, in order to endeavour to produce a crop, which should\r\nhave the additional advantage of yielding a marketable supply of the\r\nvegetable okra pods before being cut down and made into fibre. In\r\norder to do this, the seed was sown at close intervals, thereby\r\nintroducing a straight growth of stem, and care was exercised not to\r\npermit the fruiting to continue long enough for the stems to become\r\ncoarse. The fibre was extracted in the same manner as that of jute,\r\nexcept that the stems were immersed in a solution of caustic soda\r\nbefore retting to remove the thin outer bark. The marketed fibre\r\nfrom the first of these experiments realised an unsatisfactory price,\r\nbut it was estimated that the crop of pods yielded £3 per acre.\r\n\r\n_Corchorus capsularis_, one of the Indian jutes, was introduced and\r\nplanted out in 1906, but the existing native methods of cultivation\r\nand the absence of manure rendered the conditions so different from\r\nthose obtained in India, that a successful result was not brought\r\nabout. Two species of Corchorus are found in the country, and are\r\nused only as vegetables.\r\n\r\n=Ramie Fibre.=—Plantations of Ramie fibre or China grass were\r\nrecently made in various parts of the Protectorate, but although\r\nthe plant grows well during the rainy season, the long period of\r\ndry weather is detrimental to it.\r\n\r\n=Piassava.=—This fibre is produced from the sheath of the leaf\r\nstem of _Raphia vinifera_, the wine palm, and is prepared at several\r\nplaces, especially in the swampy districts near the coast. The\r\nmethod of extraction is merely that of steeping and beating out,\r\nand the resulting fibre is, in appearance, somewhat similar to fine\r\nwhalebone. The largest amount was exported in 1915, when the figure\r\nreached 1,283 tons. The price in this year attained £61 per ton. The\r\nfibre is chiefly employed for the manufacture of stiff brooms.\r\n\r\n=COTTON.=—The native cotton of Sierra Leone showed promise, at\r\none time, of great development, but insurmountable difficulties\r\nmet the efforts of the British Cotton Growing Association in their\r\nattempt to establish cotton growing for export upon a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe native mode of growing cotton is in combination with a number\r\nof other agricultural crops, the seeds of all being mixed before\r\nbeing broadcasted in a field, which has been lightly tilled. Cotton\r\nsown in this manner is permitted to yield crops for two seasons,\r\nbut the second crop is generally much inferior. Owing to this\r\nirregular manner of planting, the amount of cotton available for\r\nuse is small, and is nearly all absorbed for the supply of the\r\nnative looms; being readily saleable in the weaving districts at\r\nabout 2_d_. per lb. of seed cotton, or about twice as much as the\r\nBritish Cotton Growing Association were prepared to pay.\r\n\r\nThe inefficiency of the quality of the local cultivation, and the\r\ndisinclination on the part of the native to adopt better methods,\r\neffectually prevented more cotton being grown, and the British Cotton\r\nGrowing Association were unable to obtain sufficient material to\r\nkeep their ginnery employed.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the cotton ginnery, erected at Moyamba, a large\r\nplantation was made; the indigenous as well as many exotic varieties\r\nof the plant being put in. The site, however, proved unsuitable,\r\nlabour was found to be expensive, and the climatic conditions\r\nwere complained of. In consequence of these adverse conditions,\r\nthe Association were reluctantly obliged to abandon the work. The\r\nexport of cotton was never significant and ceased altogether in 1909.\r\n\r\n=Indigenous Varieties.=—Three well-marked types of cotton are\r\nfound throughout the country, and are known by the native (Mendi)\r\nnames of (1) Kwonde, (2) Fande Wa, (3) Dhoole. The first of these has\r\na white lint and a seed covered with white wool. An examination of\r\nthis at the Imperial Institute showed that the lint from it was the\r\nmost valuable of the three; the staple measured about 1″, and was\r\ncompared with very good quality “Indian Broach.” Two samples,\r\nvalued in 1907, were priced at 5⅜_d_. and 5¾_d_. respectively,\r\nwith good Broach at 5⅜_d_., and Middling American at 6·18_d_. The\r\nFande Wa variety has a creamy lint and a green woolly seed. It\r\nwas said to be of good quality, but the colour was not so good as\r\nthe last, and the value was consequently lower. Dhoole is rather\r\nrarer than the other two, and has a brick-red or brown lint and a\r\nbare seed. Khaki or red cottons are not in demand upon an European\r\nmarket, but locally they are somewhat sought after.\r\n\r\n=Native Weaving.=—A native cloth woven from the three different\r\nvarieties of indigenous cottons is frequently seen; the careful\r\narrangement of the naturally coloured yarns yielding a distinct\r\npattern. More often, perhaps, only the first two kinds are used,\r\nand the yarn made from them is dyed with the local indigo. In\r\nwidth the native cloths are usually narrow, and the strips are sewn\r\ntogether in order to form gowns, etc. A photograph is given showing\r\na native weaver at work at Pendembu (Fig. 13). In a few localities\r\nwider cloths are woven, but of no great length. These are often\r\nelaborately designed, and command a high price among the natives,\r\nbeing preferred to imported materials.\r\n\r\n=Exotic Cottons.=—“Cambodia” and “Sea Island” have been\r\ntried experimentally. The latter, though withstanding the heavy\r\nrainfall well, was found to be very susceptible to attacks of the\r\nlocal cotton stainer. There is still no prospect of the revival of\r\ncotton exportation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE WEAVER AT PENDEMBU.\r\n\r\nFig. 13, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KUMASSI, THE CAPITAL OF ASHANTI.\r\n\r\nFig. 14, p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STONE VAT FOR POUNDING PALM FRUITS, WITH SURROUNDING\r\nGUTTER AND OIL WELL, KROBO PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\nFig. 15, p. 68]\r\n\r\n=RICE.=—Two forms of rice are grown in the Protectorate; one under\r\nirrigation or in swampy ground, near rivers, etc., and the other\r\nentirely without any conservance of water, depending on the rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe use of rice is general throughout the country—in fact, it is\r\nprobably the most important food crop; and although, as mentioned\r\nabove, there are two forms, divided according to their mode of\r\ncultivation, each form contains many varieties distinguished by\r\ndifferent native names.\r\n\r\nIn the Timani country and the vicinity of Port Lokko the finest\r\nquality is grown, and the husking of this is said to be a prolonged\r\nprocess of drying, without previously parboiling or soaking. This\r\nrice only requires to be thoroughly dried before the husk will\r\nseparate on pounding.\r\n\r\nIn the Mendi country, the heads of rice at the harvesting are\r\ncut and tied in small bunches to dry in the fields. The grain is\r\nthen beaten out, and the chaff winnowed on a tray or in a gentle\r\nbreeze. The next step is to parboil the grain while yet in the husk,\r\nduring which operation the interior swells up so as to split the\r\nhusk. The rice is then again thoroughly dried in the sun upon mats,\r\nand finally lightly pounded in a wooden mortar in order to separate\r\nthe loosened husk, which is removed by winnowing. From the time of\r\nharvesting until the rice is ready for sale, the work is performed\r\nby women.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that a very large quantity of rice is grown, it\r\nfrequently happens that in a good season much remains unharvested,\r\nowing to the improvidence of the native. The price just after\r\nharvesting may fall as low as 1_s_. 6_d_. per bushel, but a few\r\nmonths later it may reach three times that amount. It is customary\r\nfor the Protectorate native to realise at once upon his crop,\r\nwithout taking the precaution to lay in a store for his future\r\nrequirements. In consequence of this he is compelled to buy back\r\nsupplies for his own consumption at a very much enhanced rate. The\r\nnative at the Coast takes advantage of this improvidence and profits\r\nconsiderably by it; buying up the cheap product at harvesting and\r\nrealising a handsome profit after a few months.\r\n\r\nIn quality the local rice is excellent, but in appearance it is\r\nsomewhat reddish, only a few of the finer qualities being nearly\r\nwhite. The imported rices are usually white, but are said to contain\r\nless nutriment than the local kinds.\r\n\r\nRice has always constituted the staple food of the aboriginal\r\ntribes of the Protectorate, for which reason its cultivation and\r\nthe weather conditions necessary for its successful production\r\nlocally are matters of great importance. No precaution is taken to\r\nplant any other crop as a stand-by in the event of an unfavourable\r\nrice season. In 1910 a disaster actually occurred, for the rainy\r\nseason of 1909 set in so early that it prevented many farms being\r\nburned in time to sow rice. Most of the local varieties mature\r\ntheir grain from three to five months after sowing, the earlier\r\nproducing approximately 15, and the later from 30 to 40 bushels, per\r\nacre. Owing to the failure of the rice crop in 1910, the commodity\r\nshould not have been allowed to be exported in that year, but the\r\nimportance of this was lost sight of in view of the remunerative\r\ntrade in it which had become established with different coast ports\r\nto which it was shipped. In the previous edition of this volume a\r\nrecommendation was made to foster the export of surplus Sierra Leone\r\nrice to the Gold Coast, where it was much appreciated, and doubtless\r\nthis trade may yet become important when existing restrictions are\r\nremoved, and if it is found possible to induce a larger number of\r\nthe population in the Protectorate to engage in pure agriculture,\r\nand grow crops in excess of their immediate personal requirements.\r\n\r\nThe exports for the last nine years were as follows:\r\n\r\n         Bushels  Value £\r\n  1910   35,114    5,925\r\n  1911   22,621    4,716\r\n  1912   30,715    5,712\r\n  1913   21,548    3,991\r\n  1914   18,705    4,855\r\n  1915   19,600    7,228\r\n  1916    3,192    1,364\r\n  1917    1,022      697\r\n  1918      176       93\r\n\r\nIn 1915, owing to the falling off of imports, it was found necessary\r\nto exercise control over the exports, but in spite of this the amount\r\nexported was higher than in the previous year. In 1916 the urgency of\r\nthe matter became even more pronounced and exports were restricted.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department conducted several comparative trials\r\nwith Indian and local varieties of rice. The Indian rices were\r\nmuch smaller in size of grain and were generally not considered so\r\nsuitable as the local kinds, with respect to which it was found that,\r\nwith a sufficiency of seed used in sowing and deep cultivation,\r\nexcellent crops could be secured. The native method of using less\r\nthan half a bushel of seed to sow an acre is accountable for much\r\nof the resultant crop becoming full of weeds. Excellent results\r\nwere obtained in sowing 1½ to 3 bushels per acre, when the weeds\r\nwere choked out.\r\n\r\n=CAMWOOD.=—This material, from which red dye is got, is obtained\r\nfrom the leguminous tree _Baphia nitida_. The use of it in European\r\ncountries has somewhat diminished during recent years, owing to the\r\nsubstitution for it of artificial red colouring-matter, but a small\r\nquantity is still exported, and is made use of for colouring sausage\r\nskins. The amount of camwood exported in 1915 is given as 635 tons,\r\nvalued at £8,761.\r\n\r\n=COPAL.=—The tree identified as _Copaifera Guibourtiana_ is tapped,\r\nin the Mendi country especially, for copal. The method in general\r\npractice is to cut small square patches of bark from the main trunk\r\nand branches in the month of January, and to permit these to exude\r\nresin until April, at which time the flow has ceased, and the resin\r\nhardened sufficiently to be collected.\r\n\r\nThe tree has been recorded from a few localities in Sierra Leone, but\r\nrecently plantations have been made near Moyamba and elsewhere. In\r\nthe Kwalu district, where clusters of large trees occur, much damage\r\nhas been done by overtapping, and many dead trees are to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe value of Sierra Leone copal is high, sometimes attaining over\r\ntwo shillings a pound in the European markets. The quality is,\r\nhowever, somewhat irregular, and the local grading is frequently\r\ninefficient. Information as to the quality and value of Sierra Leone\r\ncopal in comparison with other varieties is given in _Selected\r\nReports from the Imperial Institute_, Part II., Gums and Resins\r\n[Cd. 4971], pp. 170-82.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty tons were annually shipped to Europe for making varnish,\r\nbut owing to the destructive methods of collection, the Government\r\nhas prohibited trade for five years.\r\n\r\n=GROUNDNUTS.=—Practically no trade at present exists in this\r\ncrop, but efforts are being made to reintroduce the cultivation\r\ninto Bullom, where at one time a large quantity was grown for export.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of groundnuts for local consumption is carried on,\r\nbut the ridge system of planting, which is in vogue in the Gambia,\r\nis not adopted in Sierra Leone, and the groundnut stalks are\r\nremoved from the ground without the nuts attached to them. The\r\nnuts in Sierra Leone are permitted to remain in the ground and\r\ndepreciate in quality through insufficient drying. The success of\r\ngroundnut cultivation depends largely upon the plant being grown\r\non a loose bed of friable soil, and, where such conditions exist,\r\nthe Gambian method should prove satisfactory.\r\n\r\nExperiments show that the nuts should be decorticated before\r\nsowing. The usual local method of sowing is to scatter the nuts upon\r\nthe unbroken ground and then cover with loose earth. Some damage is\r\ndone by rats, bushpig and termites, and in 1914 a fungoid disease\r\n(_Cercospora personata_) appeared in Karene. The Agricultural\r\nDepartment has obtained 12 cwts. to the acre in its trials.\r\n\r\nThe variety of nut grown is apparently identical with that of the\r\nGambia, from which country the seed has probably been obtained in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n=COCOA.=—Some years ago cocoa was introduced into the Colony, but,\r\nalthough some of the Colonial planters had received their training in\r\nthe cocoa estates of Fernando Po and San Thomé, no success attended\r\ntheir efforts in Sierra Leone. The heavy rainfall, combined with\r\nthe long period of drought peculiar to the country, is detrimental\r\nto the industry. More recently experiments have been conducted in\r\nthe Protectorate, where a lighter rainfall occurs; but here also\r\nthe conditions are not generally favourable, as the long period of\r\ndry weather is not compensated for by humidity in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n=Importance of Correct Climatic Conditions.=—Cocoa plantations,\r\nin order to be successful, require atmospheric moisture fairly\r\nconstantly throughout the year, and will not thrive if exposed to\r\nexcessive and prolonged drought, or too much rain. Meteorological\r\nrecords taken at Bo, a place not far distant from that where cocoa\r\nexperiments were made, show that the conditions in respect to\r\ndistribution of rainfall, humidity and temperature are unfavourable\r\nthere. Many attempts have been made in other localities, but only in\r\nNorthern Sherbro has there been any appreciable success. The soil in\r\nthis locality is deep and is kept in good tilth by the Gallinas. The\r\nprice obtained locally for their cocoa beans was, in 1913, from\r\n3_d_. to 4_d_. per lb.; in 1914 there was an increase in the number\r\nof plants put out, as the price rose in that year to 6_d_. per lb. A\r\nsample of native cocoa was submitted to the Imperial Institute for\r\nexamination and report in 1916, and was found to be incompletely\r\nfermented with a rather harsh flavour. The trade valuation, however,\r\nwas equal to the standard price ruling for Accra beans at the same\r\ntime (cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1916, p. 589). Although the outlook for\r\nNorthern Sherbro is promising, cocoa cannot attain much success in\r\nthe country generally, on account of unsuitable climatic conditions\r\nand general ineptitude of most of the native tribes.\r\n\r\n=COFFEE.=—A few years ago coffee was grown in the Colony for\r\nexport, the indigenous variety, _Coffea stenophylla_ as well as\r\n_C. Liberica_ being planted. The former bears a very small berry\r\nand yields an excellent, strong-flavoured beverage. The latter is\r\nbetter known and has a large berry. Throughout the hill villages of\r\nthe Colony a great number of trees are seen, but, owing to a fall\r\nin the price of the product, most of the crop remains unpicked,\r\nalthough it should not prove unremunerative even at the present\r\nprices to continue the export.\r\n\r\n=INDIGO.=—Species of Indigofera and a scandent shrub, _Lonchocarpus\r\ncyanescens_, or “Gara” (Mendi), are used for the extraction\r\nof the blue dyes commonly employed in the country. The leaves of\r\nthe latter plant are said to be in such demand that a quantity is\r\nannually imported from Southern Nigeria. A description of the method\r\nof dyeing with “Gara,” and an explanation of the process, are\r\ngiven in the _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. v. (1907),\r\np. 129.\r\n\r\n=FRUIT.=—Some parts of the Colony seem favourable for the\r\ncultivation of various tropical fruits, such as bananas, oranges,\r\nmangoes, and pineapples, and it is possible that the proximity of\r\nSierra Leone to European ports might enable some of these to be\r\ngrown for export.\r\n\r\n=BEESWAX.=—A small amount of beeswax is collected in the\r\nProtectorate, and instruction has been given to the natives in some\r\nlocalities with a view to the improvement of the methods employed by\r\nthem. The Government has arranged for the instruction of some of the\r\nlocal officials while on leave in England in practical bee-keeping.\r\n\r\nThe bee found in Sierra Leone is identical with the variety\r\nof _Apis mellifera_ found throughout West Africa, and is named\r\nvar. _Adansonii_. It is rather small, but produces an excellent\r\nhoney, which is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n=OIL SEEDS.=—A tall tree bearing a large flattened legume, known\r\nto the Mendi people as “Fai,” or “Fawe,” has been sent\r\nfor examination to the Imperial Institute on account of the oil\r\ncontained in the seed. This tree was identified as _Pentaclethra\r\nmacrophylla_, and, although common throughout the forested zone,\r\nis not seen in profusion anywhere. The oil has been tested, and\r\nis said to be capable of utilisation for the manufacture of soap\r\nand candles, but not for alimentary purposes. The difficulties in\r\nconnection with the collection of the seed in large quantities and\r\nthe extraction of the kernel from the outer horny shell, hinder\r\nthe creation of a remunerative export trade.\r\n\r\nAnother vegetable oil is that obtained from the fruit of _Pentadesma\r\nbutyracea_, a tree found in some parts of Bullom and in the\r\nPort Lokko district. The fat extracted from the ripe fruit is\r\noccasionally brought for sale to Freetown, where it is known as\r\nMandingo butter. It does not occur in sufficient quantities to be\r\ncommercially useful, although it yields an edible oil.\r\n\r\n_Lophira alata_, which is widely distributed throughout the grass\r\ncountry in the north, and is replaced by a nearly allied species,\r\n_L. procera_, in the forest zone, bears a seed which contains a\r\nlarge percentage of oil, which can be used for soap manufacture. The\r\ndifficulty of decorticating the seeds and their preservation during\r\ntransport are disadvantages in the establishment of an export trade.\r\n\r\nAnalyses of the fats or oils yielded by these and other West\r\nAfrican oil seeds, and information as to their quality, possible\r\nuses and value will be found in _Selected Reports from the Imperial\r\nInstitute_, Pt. V., Oil Seeds (cf. also _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1912,\r\n1913, 1915, 1917, 1918).\r\n\r\n=Progress in Agriculture.=—In 1910 the Agricultural Department\r\nwas reorganised on a better basis than formerly, and the purely\r\nforestry work, which had been previously carried on by the\r\nAgricultural Superintendent, in addition to his other duties,\r\nwas then transferred to a Forestry Department formed in that year.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the scheme of work laid down by the new Department of\r\nAgriculture may be said to be on the following chief lines:\r\n\r\n(i) The introduction of a cheap and effective organic manure,\r\nand the demonstration of its value in such a manner as to induce\r\nthe people to use it on their land, and thereby to employ more\r\neconomical means for the production of food, etc.\r\n\r\n(ii) The institution of a proper rotation of crops suitable for\r\neach district or locality.\r\n\r\n(iii) The demonstration to natives of the fact, that, by the proper\r\nemployment of manuring and crop rotation, they would be able to\r\nfarm the same piece of land for an indefinite number of years,\r\nduring which time it should increase rather than diminish in\r\nfertility. By such demonstration it should be possible to put an\r\nend to the wasteful and permanently destructive methods at present\r\nemployed of shifting cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Department has a piece of land on the Experiment\r\nFarm at Njala, which has been under crops annually for the past\r\neight years, and the condition of it at present is said to be a more\r\nfertile one, owing to the system of manuring and rotation employed,\r\nthan it was at the commencement of work. This is mentioned here, as\r\nit is in contradiction to the well-worn native excuse for changing\r\nthe site of farms annually, _i.e._, that it is essential for the\r\nmaintenance of the fertility of land that after a few years’\r\ncultivation the “bush” be allowed to become re-established so\r\nthat, on burning, a sufficient amount of wood ash may be obtained\r\nto renovate it.\r\n\r\n(iv) To encourage the natives in the formation of permanent\r\nplantations of fruit and other economic trees.\r\n\r\nTo these ends, in the first place, analyses of soils from various\r\nparts of the country have been made by the Imperial Institute. At\r\nthe same time samples of the soil taken from localities where kola,\r\ncocoa, rice and groundnuts were grown, have been compared with\r\nthat from uncleared “bush.” The result of the examination,\r\nin the latter case, showed the soil had a deficiency of lime and\r\nphosphoric acid. A special analysis was also made of the soil of\r\nthe Banana Islands, which was found to have an adequate quantity\r\nof nitrogen but to be deficient in potash and phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nWith a view to producing a more satisfactory condition of soil\r\nin some parts, different leguminous crops have been cultivated\r\nand alternated with Sorghum millet (Guinea corn), maize and\r\nrice. Among the species tried by the Agricultural Department\r\nare: soya beans (_Glycine soja_), black gram (_Phaseolus mungo_),\r\npigeon peas (_Cajanus indicus_), Java beans (_Phaseolus lunatus_),\r\ncowpeas (_Vigna catjang_), sword beans (_Canavalia ensiformis_)\r\nand horse-beans (_Dolichos lablab_). Yams and groundnuts have also\r\nbeen tried, and a yield of 6 tons 3 cwts. per acre of the former\r\ncrop was obtained at the experimental farm at Njala in 1914.\r\n\r\n=Forestry.=—On the formation of a Forestry Department in 1910,\r\na survey was at once proceeded with, and active steps were taken\r\nto save from extinction the small extent of forest remaining in the\r\nColony and Protectorate. From the survey it appeared that some 99 per\r\ncent. of the Protectorate primary forest had already been destroyed\r\nby the wasteful methods of farming generally practised. Intervals\r\nbetween the clearing of the bush for farms was from nine to five\r\nyears, the effect of which was to entirely eliminate the primary\r\nforest areas. Where patches still remain, however, many useful\r\nspecies of timber trees are found. By the introduction of regular\r\nforest control and reafforestation, it is hoped that conditions\r\nmay be improved to some extent, and economic trees especially\r\npreserved. Forest legislation has already been introduced to insure\r\nthe preservation of copal trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =GOLD COAST=\r\n\r\nTerritory held by Great Britain under Mandate is hatched in\r\nRed. [Legend]\r\n\r\n_Stanford’s Geogl. Estabt., London._]\r\n\r\n\r\n        =THE GOLD COAST, ASHANTI AND THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES=\r\n\r\n\r\n=INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.= =Geographical Position.=—The Gold\r\nCoast Colony, with the dependencies of Ashanti and the Northern\r\nTerritories, forms a nearly oblong tract of country, bounded on the\r\nnorth by the 11th parallel of north latitude and the French Sudan,\r\non the south by the Gulf of Guinea, on the east by Togoland, and on\r\nthe west by the Ivory Coast (French). The course of the Black Volta\r\nforms the natural boundary on the north-west, and that of the Daka,\r\ncontinued as the main Volta river, a large extent of the eastern,\r\nwhich, however, is in course of realignment.\r\n\r\n=Area and Population.=—The area of the whole country is estimated\r\nat about 82,000 sq. miles, and the population at upwards of\r\n1,500,000.\r\n\r\n=Divisions.=—The Colony proper forms the most southern of the\r\nthree divisions of which the country is composed, and is bounded on\r\nthe north by an irregular line dividing it from Ashanti. This line\r\ncommences upon the western frontier at a point about 6° 40′ N. and\r\n3° 7′ W., and runs to a point on the Ofin river about 6° 30′\r\nN. and 2° W., continuing southward along the course of the Ofin to\r\nits junction with the Pra river, whence it follows the last-named\r\nriver in a north-easterly direction to near Abetifi, and continues in\r\nan irregular line to the Volta, meeting it below the junction of the\r\nAssuokoko stream. Ashanti is separated from the Northern Territories\r\nby an irregular boundary-line from east to west, on the south side\r\nof the Black and main Volta rivers. It is almost entirely forested\r\nup to the boundaries of the largest towns. A view of Kumassi,\r\nthe capital, is given, showing the proximity of the forest (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nFrom a climatic as well as an agricultural standpoint the country\r\nis more conveniently divided into two parts by a line which sharply\r\ndefines the limits of the region of dense forest from that of the\r\ngrass lands with few trees, which is characteristic of the country\r\nto the north. This line is probably the northern limit of the tract\r\nof country subject to a prolonged rainy season, and owing to the\r\ndensity of the forest south of it seems to have constituted the\r\nextreme distance to which the Mohammedan conquerors from the north\r\nwere able to penetrate, when attempting to subdue and convert the\r\npagan tribes to their south. The improved methods of agriculture\r\nfound among the tribes inhabiting the ultra-forest country of\r\nthe Northern Territories may be attributable to the teaching of\r\nthese conquering people. On account of the marked differences in\r\nthe conditions and the agricultural development of the forest and\r\nultra-forest regions, it appears to be more convenient to refer\r\nto the products from the Northern Territories in a separate part,\r\nand this course has been followed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PART I.—GOLD COAST AND ASHANTI\r\n\r\n=Origin of Tribes.=—Tradition among the natives maintains that\r\nthe two great tribes of Fanti and Ashanti were originally from\r\nthe same stock, and it is probable that this was also the case\r\nwith regard to the people of Tufel, Denkera, Assin and Aquapim,\r\nwho are said to speak a dialect of the same language as that of the\r\nFantis and Ashantis. Completely different languages are, however,\r\nspoken by the Appolonias, Ahantas, Agoonahs, Accras, and Adampes\r\nliving near the coast, and these are supposed to represent the\r\nremains of an earlier race.\r\n\r\nThe native belief is that the whole people were originally\r\ncomposed of twelve families or tribes, and that each was called by\r\na separate name in some way indicating the occupation. According\r\nto Bowdich, those calling themselves after animals of the forest\r\nprobably represented the families employing their time in hunting,\r\nand those bearing such names as cornstalk (Abrotoo) and plantain\r\n(Abbradi) applied themselves to agriculture. The name Agoonah,\r\nimplying “oil-palm locality,” seems to have been applied to all\r\nthose who were traders. Individuals are still said to assume these\r\ndistinctive names without regard to their usual tribal affinities.\r\n\r\nThe probable reason for the backward condition of agriculture in the\r\nforest region is that a food supply was procurable from the forest\r\nitself, and the continual intertribal warfare, in which the people\r\nseemed to have been engaged, was opposed to the cultivation of crops,\r\nwhich might become an incentive to a covetous attack. More recently,\r\nsince these conditions have become altered, through the pacification\r\nof the country, some of the tribes, who were the first to become\r\nsettled, have adopted a form of cultivation which, although wasteful,\r\nseems to be common among the forest people of West Africa. By\r\nmeans of imperfect clearing of the ground before cultivation, and\r\nsuperficial turning up of the soil, small crops of grain (maize) and\r\nroots (yams and cassava) are raised, and the land is usually left to\r\nrevert to a state of weeds and “bush” after two or three years’\r\nuse. This resembles the “Chena” system in Ceylon. The tribes\r\nwho have developed a better and more economical form of working are\r\nthose in whose districts the advent of cocoa planters has so raised\r\nthe value of land that they are compelled to utilise the same plot\r\nmore frequently for their annual crops. As an indication of this,\r\nthe best cultivated fields are those of the Krobos, Akims, Krepes,\r\nand Kwahus, while the least advanced tribes are the Ashantis.\r\n\r\nOwing to the remunerative return from cocoa cultivation in parts\r\nof the country, this commodity has attained the first place among\r\nexported agricultural and forest products. In recent years, moreover,\r\ndevelopment has been so rapid that the country is now the largest\r\nproducer of cocoa in the world. Among exports, rubber, palm oil,\r\npalm kernels and timber follow it in order of importance.\r\n\r\n=COCOA.=—As a preliminary to an account of the cocoa industry in\r\nthe Gold Coast, it may be considered useful to refer briefly to\r\nthe botanical position of the tree which produces cocoa, as well\r\nas to the varieties which are cultivated. A comparison of the\r\nmethods employed in the Gold Coast with those adopted elsewhere\r\nseems also necessary.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a native of Trinidad and the north-eastern part of\r\nSouth America, and is botanically classified in the Natural Order\r\n_STERCULIACEÆ_, sub-Order _Buettnerieæ_, under the name of\r\n_Theobroma cacao_ of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies, from which the cultivation has spread into\r\nseveral tropical countries, three fairly well-marked varieties are\r\nrecognised as commercially useful, and these bear the local names\r\nof “Criollo,” “Forastero,” and “Calabacillo.” The first\r\nof these is said to be identical with that occurring at Caracas,\r\nin Venezuela, and is usually called by the name of that place when\r\nexported from South America. The _Criollo_ variety is the source of\r\nsome of the highest-priced produce, but _Forastero_ has some points\r\nin its favour for general cultivation, the chief of which appears to\r\nbe greater hardiness. For this reason it seems to have become easily\r\nestablished in the islands of San Thomé and Fernando Po, where the\r\nsub-variety known as _Amelonado_ is that of general occurrence,\r\nand to have spread from there to the mainland of West Africa. In\r\nCeylon the _Forastero_ variety is also much grown in plantations. The\r\nthird variety, _Calabacillo_, yields an inferior product and does\r\nnot appear to have been introduced into the eastern hemisphere.[1]\r\n\r\nCocoa, as shipped from the plantations, is the dried bean or seed,\r\nwhich has been removed from the fruit pod of the tree, and may or\r\nmay not have been fermented before drying. The properly fermented\r\nseeds or beans find more favour in European markets than those which\r\nhave not undergone the process, but it is chiefly in an imperfectly\r\nfermented condition that cocoa beans are exported from the Gold\r\nCoast. Attempts are being made to alter this, so as to produce a\r\nbetter quality.\r\n\r\nCocoa forms a very nutritious food, and beverage after preparation by\r\nthe manufacturer, entering the markets in a manufactured form under\r\nthe names of cocoa or chocolate. No native manufacture is employed\r\nin the Gold Coast, although cocoa butter has been extracted on a\r\nsmall scale at Odumase.\r\n\r\nThe following account is that which is generally accepted regarding\r\nthe first introduction of the tree into the Gold Coast. About the\r\nyear 1879 a native trader, named Tete Quasshi, brought some of\r\nthe seed from Fernando Po and made a small plantation at Mampong,\r\nwhich is situated about ten miles north of Aburi in the Volta River\r\nDistrict. The trees grew well, and the first crops of pods were said\r\nto have been disposed of to other natives at £1 per pod. Following\r\nthe example of this trader, the Basel Mission Trading Association\r\nimported more pods from Fernando Po, and for some time they were\r\nable to dispose of them at a large profit. The variety introduced\r\nwas _Forastero-Amelonado_, and was found to thrive extremely well\r\nunder the local conditions prevalent in the districts of the Volta\r\nRiver, Kwahu, and Eastern Akim.\r\n\r\nThe first shipment of cocoa from the Gold Coast was made in 1891,\r\nwhen 80 lbs., valued at £4, were exported. From that time onward\r\nthe annual exported quantity has increased somewhat irregularly until\r\nthe returns for 1919 show 176,155 tons, worth more than £8,000,000.\r\n\r\nNo estimate can be given of the area at present under cocoa\r\ncultivation, for the reason that a large number of the cultivators\r\nonly possess a few trees standing near their houses or scattered\r\nin their farms. Where plantations exist they are usually small,\r\nand, owing to the irregularity of the planting, no efficient idea\r\nof the possible production could be obtained by measurement of the\r\nplanted area alone.\r\n\r\nSince the settlement of the Ashantis into more peaceful modes of\r\nliving, and the adoption by them of agricultural work, cocoa planting\r\nhas rapidly spread through Ashanti-Akim, and new plantations may be\r\nfound even westward of Kumassi. From Axim also there is an extension\r\nof cocoa-growing towards the north, and it has recently been stated\r\nthat the most promising land for the cultivation of the tree is to be\r\nfound to the west of the railway, between Sekondi and Kumassi. The\r\nonce proverbially truculent and warlike Ashantis have recently,\r\nto a large extent, become peaceful cocoa planters. Plantations are\r\nalso found under European control, often in combination with rubber\r\nor kola; but cocoa does not combine with rubber as satisfactorily\r\nas coffee, which is more frequently employed. Under “Rubber”\r\nsome particulars of the plantations, whose returns are available,\r\nare supplied.\r\n\r\nIn common with many other cultivated plants, cocoa requires certain\r\ndefinite combinations of climate and soil to ensure remunerative\r\ncultivation, and unless these exist the introduction is not to\r\nbe recommended. With regard to climate, a considerable rainfall\r\nis generally thought necessary, the intervals of dry weather not\r\nbeing too prolonged. The drainage of the land should be good, for\r\nif the water cannot drain away within a reasonably short time, the\r\ntrees will be adversely and often severely affected. Although it is\r\nrecognised that cocoa can sustain itself under conditions of drought\r\nfor a short time, districts subject to periodical absence of rain for\r\na month or more are unsuitable, and trees planted in such places will\r\ngenerally die after a brief period. The annual rainfall in the cocoa\r\ndistricts of Trinidad averages about 72 inches, but a much heavier\r\nfall is experienced in the plantations of Ceylon. In neither of\r\nthese countries, however, is there an annual long period of complete\r\ndrought, which is a feature common in most parts of West Africa;\r\nand even when an interval without rain occurs, the humidity of the\r\natmosphere compensates for the absence of it. Ceylon is visited by\r\na double monsoon or rainy season, which is also the case in a less\r\nmarked degree in the Gold Coast. The next requirement of importance\r\nis a soil of suitable quality. It is generally considered best to\r\nselect land which possesses a moderate amount of loose clay mixed\r\nwith sand, and, if the surface be thickly covered with vegetable\r\ndeposit, so much the better. Steep hillsides, stiff, boggy, sandy, or\r\nrocky land are to be avoided. The presence of low scrub on uncleared\r\nland is an indication of poverty of soil, although the presence of\r\nheavy forest does not necessarily guarantee the suitability of the\r\nlocality, as imperfectly drained land often bears a heavy forest\r\ngrowth. Good natural drainage is essential, and is nearly always\r\nfound where the land slopes and the rock underlying the soil is\r\nfriable or deep. Natural drainage can often be improved by artificial\r\nmeans. The last important condition necessary is the selection of a\r\nposition where shade and wind protection can be obtained naturally\r\nto as great an extent as possible. Plantations in valleys, sheltered\r\nby mountain spurs or by belts of high forest, are suitable, and\r\nsuch formations are met with in many parts of the Gold Coast and\r\nAshanti. In these localities the climate as well as the positions\r\nand soil obtainable are generally so well adapted for the fruitful\r\ngrowth of cocoa that, even where the average annual rainfall is as\r\nlow as 41 inches (the average at Aburi), plantations are proving\r\nsuccessful, the regular distribution, humidity of the atmosphere,\r\nand the natural shade constituting a compensation for the shortage.\r\n\r\nThe native planter sows the seeds in small patches or in roughly\r\nprepared beds in the vicinity of water, often in such proximity to\r\none another as to choke a number of the young plants. This form of\r\nnursery is met with throughout the forests, and it is common to find\r\ncircular patches containing two or three hundred plants adjoining\r\na road. In addition to this, a large number of seedlings are grown\r\nat, and distributed from, the Government Botanic Gardens. Native\r\nplantations are for the most part formed of irregular lines of\r\ntrees, generally planted too closely. The evil effect of this\r\ndoes not become apparent until the trees attain a large size, when\r\nthe excessive shade they afford to their fruit-bearing branches,\r\nwhich in cocoa consist of the trunk and main structure, prevents\r\nthe fruit from forming and induces rot through want of evaporation\r\nof moisture. The native planter is slow to recognise this, and\r\ndisinclined to remedy the matter by removing some of the trees. The\r\ndistance at which cocoa trees are planted by the native is roughly\r\nfrom 7 to 10 feet apart, whereas that recommended for plantations\r\nin the West Indies and Ceylon varies, with the quality of the soil\r\nand the elevation, from 12 to 15 feet; the latter would be more\r\nsuitable for most of the Gold Coast plantations. The advantage\r\nwhich the native planter sees in his method of planting is, that\r\nin addition to getting a larger number of trees into a given space,\r\nthe density of their foliage soon becomes so great that weeds cease\r\nto grow beneath, rendering cultivation unnecessary. Until such a\r\nstate has been arrived at, the cutting of weeds is an operation\r\nwhich may have to be performed twice, or even three times, in the\r\nyear. This is the only form of cultivation given, no manure being\r\nused or any breaking of the soil done. In the West Indies it is not\r\ncustomary to disturb the surface soil, except in so far as it may be\r\nnecessary to apply manure or remove catch crops; but even in these\r\ncases great care is exercised, as it is found that the cocoa tree is\r\nto a large extent a surface feeder, and spreads lateral fine roots at\r\nvery little depth below the surface. Shade is obtained naturally to\r\na large degree, but in the early years of the tree’s existence,\r\ncassava and plantains are planted to afford it. The plantation\r\nof Para rubber with cocoa has been recommended in such a manner\r\nthat each would occur alternately in a diagonal line. This does\r\nnot appear a very satisfactory plan, owing to the fact that Para\r\nrubber trees in West Africa shed their leaves annually at about\r\nthe time that cocoa most needs shade. In the small patches of cocoa\r\ntrees, which constitute most of the native plantations, permanent\r\nand sufficient shade is generally given by the surrounding forest\r\ntrees, and it is of small importance in such cases to consider the\r\nplantation of permanent shade trees.\r\n\r\n=Pruning,= in the West Indies, is attended with the greatest amount\r\nof care, and is performed for the purpose of producing a vigorous\r\ntree by the removal of all useless wood, and of encouraging fruiting\r\nbranches to increase their production. In order to do the latter it\r\nis essential to remove any superfluous number of primary branches,\r\nthree or four being considered sufficient for one tree. A similar\r\nregulation of growth is required with regard to the secondary\r\nand tertiary branches. In addition to this, care is given to\r\nretain the correct balance for the tree, and, when cutting out\r\nbranches, to avoid making jagged cuts or slashes. The West African\r\nnative does not prune with these objects in view, but employs a\r\n“cutlass” or “machete” to cut out those branches which\r\nseem to be giving too much shade or which have become interlaced,\r\nregardless of their value to the tree or of the wounds inflicted\r\nin the operation. Efforts have been made to teach pruning at the\r\nBotanical Stations, but the demonstrations have not been largely\r\nattended, and a great deal of damage continues to be done through\r\nignorance of the objects and effects of pruning. Many of the older\r\nplantations, owing to bad treatment and too close planting, are\r\nyielding an annually diminishing crop, but new ones are springing\r\nup in increasing numbers each year, which is an obvious indication\r\nthat the industry is proving a profitable one.\r\n\r\n=Insect Pests and Vegetable Parasites.=—Wounds, such as those\r\ndescribed above, often render the tree more susceptible to the\r\nattacks of insect pests; but, although it has been stated that cocoa\r\ntrees in the Gold Coast are seriously affected in this way, such\r\nis not often the case. Beetles of the _Longicorn_ group are found\r\ndamaging the tree to some extent wherever it has been planted. Two\r\nspecies are recorded from the West Indies: _Steirastoma histrionica_,\r\nWhite, from Trinidad, and _S. depressa_, Linn., from Grenada. On\r\nthe trees in the Gold Coast _Armatosterna buquetiana_, White,\r\nand a _Glenea sp._ have been found doing similar damage. These\r\ninsects deposit their eggs in crevices of the bark or on wounds,\r\nand the grubs which emerge bore into the trunk, living and growing\r\nin size in the interior of the wood until mature, when they change\r\ninto pupæ, and finally into beetles. The presence of these grubs\r\nis easily detected by the quantity of fine particles of wood or\r\n“frass” which are thrown out of the entrance hole; and, if a\r\nflexible wire be inserted until it reaches and impales the grub,\r\nit will often prevent the damage becoming serious. The nests of\r\nlarge red ants (_Œcophylla sp._), which feed upon the saccharine\r\njuices which exude from the pods, may often be observed on cocoa\r\ntrees, but as the ants viciously bite any living thing which may\r\nventure upon the tree, they are probably a safeguard against the\r\ndepredations of rats and squirrels that eat out the contents of\r\nthe ripe fruit while still on the tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCOA AT MRAMRA ATTACKED BY BLACK COCOA-BARK BUG.\r\n\r\nFig. 16, p. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING COCOA BEANS AT MRAMRA.\r\n\r\nFig. 17, p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE TAPPING INDIGENOUS RUBBER TREE (_FUNTUMIA\r\nELASTICA_), OBOAMANG, ASHANTI.\r\n\r\nFig. 18, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the writer drew attention to a black hemipterous insect\r\ncausing destruction to plantations in the Ashanti-Akim region,\r\nwhere careless cultivation prevailed (cf. _Bull. Entom. Research_,\r\nvol. i. pt. viii. 1910). This insect, known as the “Black\r\ncocoa-bark bug” or “Sankonuabe,” was named _Sahlbergella\r\ntheobroma_, Distant, and subsists in all its stages upon the\r\nsap of cocoa branches obtained through punctures made by its\r\nproboscis.[2] The attacked trees are atrophied or killed outright\r\n(Fig. 16). Spraying with petroleum-soap emulsion has proved\r\nan effective remedy, but native planters do not readily adopt\r\nit. Recently the insect has been found sapping the silk cotton\r\ntree, and planters are warned against having this tree in their\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nAnother insect, which belongs to the same Order as the last,\r\nand the genus _Helopeltis_, has been observed puncturing the pods\r\nand causing them to become black-spotted, distorted, and sometimes\r\nkilled by the attack. This is allied to _H. Antonii_, Sign., which\r\npunctures cocoa pods in the same manner in Ceylon. The insect\r\ndoes not appear to be numerous at present, but should be sought\r\non damaged pods and killed at every opportunity, as some species\r\nof the same genus have developed into the worst enemies of tea and\r\ncinchona in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nFungoid parasites appear to be rare in the Gold Coast, although they\r\nhave been observed commonly in other places in Africa. In some of\r\nthe damper parts of Ashanti a fungoid thread blight was observed\r\non cocoa, and was found to be common upon several forest shrubs in\r\nthe same places. This is perhaps _Stilbum nanum_, Massee; it should\r\nbe treated by means of scraping with a wooden knife combined with\r\nspraying with Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\n=Harvesting and Preparing.=—The native cocoa grower collects the\r\npods from his trees at the time when he estimates he can gather\r\nthe most, and, in consequence, many over-ripe and under-ripe fruits\r\nare taken with the ripe. The effect of this is to give an irregular\r\nproduct which can never possess the attributes of a good cocoa. The\r\npods are usually pulled off the tree, a knife being seldom used;\r\nand in the action of pulling off, the cushion, upon which the pod\r\nis borne, is often torn and injured. As it is from this point, or\r\nnear it, that the successive crops of flowers and fruits proceed,\r\nthe bearing power of the tree is frequently diminished in this\r\nway. The use of a knife and the necessity for frequent pickings,\r\nto ensure the pods being taken when mature, are among the most\r\nimportant lessons which the native planter should be taught. The\r\npods after collection are thrown into a heap upon the ground, and\r\nare often left without further attention for two or three days,\r\nafter which they are broken open with the aid of a “cutlass,”\r\nand the contents are scooped out into a basket. The result is\r\na mixture of beans, in their surrounding pulp, in different\r\nstages of maturity. The length of time that the beans remain in\r\nthe basket is generally only regulated by the convenience of the\r\ncollector. The next operation is to remove as much of the pulp as\r\npossible by washing in a stream, and this is more easily effected\r\nwith the over-ripe beans or with those which have been allowed to\r\n“sweat” or ferment. After washing, the beans are spread thinly\r\nupon mats, raised upon rough frames, in order to dry them in the\r\nsun. An illustration is given showing this process (Fig. 17). Such is\r\nthe crude and irregular method employed by the natives of the Gold\r\nCoast, who until quite recently had little or no knowledge of the\r\nadvantages of fermentation. Owing to the small quantities with which\r\nthey worked at one time, it is probable that the fermenting action\r\nin the pulp was seldom set up. During the last few years attention\r\nhas been given to this by the more intelligent planters, and it is\r\nnot uncommon to find that boxes and barrels have been brought into\r\nuse by them, and that fermentation has been allowed to proceed for\r\nfrom four to ten days with satisfactory results. Drying is still\r\nconducted in the manner described above, and is often incomplete,\r\nbut, to remedy the defects of this, one of the European buying\r\nfirms has erected a drying machine, in which all the cocoa bought\r\nis thoroughly dried before shipment.\r\n\r\nThe skilled cocoa planter of the West Indies and Ceylon is careful\r\nto pick only those pods which are quite mature, and, in order to do\r\nthis, he is obliged to go over his plantation frequently. Mature\r\npods are those which have assumed a yellowish or reddish colour,\r\nand considerable experience is necessary to judge this with\r\naccuracy. The pods are removed by means of a cutting instrument\r\ncalled a “cocoa hook,” with which care can be more easily given\r\nto the preservation of the cushion. The pods are placed in heaps\r\nand, in the case of small estates where one day’s picking is\r\ninsufficient to procure a fermentation, they are left for, perhaps,\r\ntwo days until a sufficient quantity has been obtained. Sorting,\r\naccording to variety and degree of maturity, is resorted to before\r\nopening, and, again, when cut open, care is taken to separate such\r\nbeans as are found over-ripe. This practice is strictly adhered\r\nto in Ceylon, but is often disregarded in the West Indies. No\r\nwashing is done at this stage, but the beans, with their pulp\r\nattached, are placed in barrels, boxes, or vats for the purpose\r\nof fermentation, which is brought about by the decomposition\r\nof the pulp, and is complete when the liquor, thus formed, has\r\nimpregnated the interior of the bean and changed the colour of it\r\nfrom purple to rich chocolate brown. The shell becomes toughened,\r\nand the remaining pulp is more easily removed after this process\r\nhas been undergone. Washing, if it is considered necessary, is then\r\nproceeded with, and is generally done in Ceylon, though not in the\r\nWest Indies. Drying is chiefly done in the sun in the West Indies,\r\nand the beans are spread thickly and turned constantly. Drying\r\nhouses, which have roofs capable of being slid over the cocoa on\r\nthe approach of rain, are used. In Ceylon hot air distributed by\r\ncentrifugal fans is the common method. Polishing, which is often\r\nemployed in the West Indies, is done by sifting finely powdered\r\nred earth over the partly dried beans while they are exposed to\r\nthe sun, when, it is maintained, the earth assists to remove the\r\nremaining pulp as well as to absorb the moisture, at the same time\r\ngiving the surfaces of the beans a polished exterior. Annatto is\r\nsaid to be used instead of red earth in Venezuela, but the addition\r\nof this is, presumably, with the object of colouring, rather than\r\npolishing. “Dancing” is an operation designed to prevent the\r\ndevelopment of mildew, and consists of treading the beans with the\r\nbare feet.\r\n\r\nSome of the large manufacturers in Europe have recommended that\r\nthe Gold Coast planters should ferment their produce, but should\r\nnot wash the beans after fermentation.\r\n\r\n=Markets.=—Certain large cocoa-buying centres are recognised,\r\nwhich, in the Volta River district, are situated at the foot of the\r\nhilly country, in positions convenient for transport to the ports\r\nof shipment. In addition to these, however, a good deal of buying\r\nis proceeded with at smaller places in the midst of the growing\r\ndistricts, but these probably represent the localities for the\r\ntransactions carried on by agents or middlemen. Until the produce\r\nis actually in the hands of the shippers, the conveyance of cocoa is\r\nalmost entirely done by head-loads of about 60 lbs. The head-load is\r\nthe standard for trading, and the local price quoted is always with\r\nreference to it. It is customary for the buying shippers to send\r\nout their agents to the cocoa districts to arrange for the purchase\r\nof the crops, and it is always necessary that such purchases should\r\nbe paid for in silver, no notes or cheques being accepted. Owing to\r\ncompetition during the past few years, the agents have often paid\r\nthe grower a sum of money long before his crop was ready for picking,\r\nin order to guarantee that it may be bought by no one else. This has\r\nhad the effect of making the grower careless in the preparation of\r\nhis crop, and has caused the production of much bad material. The\r\nreport that at another town, often distant by many days’ journey,\r\na higher price is being paid than that obtained in a market close at\r\nhand, will frequently induce a native to convey his head-loads to the\r\ndistant market, regardless of the fact that the extra shilling or so\r\nhe may receive does not appear to be sufficient compensation for the\r\nadditional labour and time expended. This points to the fact that\r\nthe native does not put the same value on his time and labour when\r\nhe is working for himself as he does when he is employed by others.\r\n\r\nThe buyers of cocoa pack it in bags for shipment, and these are\r\nconveyed to the ports by motor lorries or placed inside large casks,\r\nsimilar to those used for palm oil, and rolled along the roads. Some\r\nof the shipments are conveyed in river steamers on the Volta, and,\r\nmore recently, owing to the growers having found a better market\r\nfor a short time at Kumassi, a considerable amount was sent by rail\r\nfrom that place to Sekondi. In consequence of the imperfect state\r\nof dryness in which the cocoa is often sold by the planter, a great\r\namount of care should be exercised before mixing and packing. Sorting\r\nis not much practised, and some of the beans often become attacked\r\nby mildew before reaching Europe, which depreciates the value\r\nof the whole package. It is partly owing to the disregard of the\r\nprecautions of sorting and final drying that the West African cocoa\r\nhas earned such a bad name, and if more shippers were to follow the\r\nexample set by the one firm that has erected a drying apparatus,\r\nit would do much to improve matters in this direction. Cocoa is\r\ndifficult to dry completely in the growing districts by means of\r\nthe sun, as the atmosphere in these localities is often so humid\r\nthat the beans absorb moisture when removed from the sun’s rays,\r\nand it is for this reason especially that the final drying should\r\nbe done by the shippers. Transport to the ports of shipment from\r\nthe growing districts will be facilitated by the construction of a\r\nshort railway, which it is contemplated making from Accra, and until\r\nthis is ready the carriage by head-loads, cask-rolling, and motor\r\nlorries will probably continue. The presence of the “tsetse”\r\nfly throughout the growing districts prevents the possibility of\r\ndraught cattle being used.\r\n\r\nA system of pooling purchases was agreed upon some years ago by a\r\nnumber of leading shippers, in accordance with which competition\r\namong themselves was suppressed, and a fixed price was to be given\r\nfor all cocoa. This action was doubtless taken in order to prevent\r\nruinous competition, but had the effect of checking improvement in\r\nthe quality, as no encouragement was given to the planter to prepare\r\nthe cocoa with greater care. The few shippers who did not join in\r\nthis “combine” were enabled to obtain the better qualities at a\r\nvery slightly enhanced price. In 1906 the general quality of Gold\r\nCoast cocoa had so deteriorated that the merchants were asked by\r\nthe Government for their assistance to improve it. This led to an\r\ninquiry which revealed the state of affairs mentioned above. The\r\nobvious remedy of paying a price according to quality did not find\r\nfavour with the combine, who appear to have argued that it would\r\nnot profit them to pay a higher price for the small variable lots\r\nof improved produce which might result. It was stated by some of\r\nthe local merchants in Accra that Gold Coast cocoa was generally\r\nsuitable for sale in certain European markets, where it was adapted\r\nfor the manufacture of a cheap form of sweetmeat, and that, if the\r\nquality were improved and the price raised in consequence, damage\r\nwould be done to a new and rapidly growing trade. The merchants\r\nultimately agreed to endeavour to improve the standard of quality,\r\nand it was arranged that all the cocoa brought in to the markets\r\nat Aimensa and Dodowa should be graded, with a view to regulating\r\nthe price according to grade. This plan fell through at the last\r\nmoment, as a test sample of picked cocoa was said to have been\r\npriced at only 1_s_. 6_d_. per cwt. over ordinary “Accra” in\r\nthe European market. The fall in the value of the residue was said\r\nto be uncompensated for by the small increase mentioned.\r\n\r\n=Improvement of Quality.=—Inquiries conducted by the Imperial\r\nInstitute pointed to the fact that well-prepared Gold Coast cocoa\r\ncould obtain high prices in Europe. In 1907 a consignment was sent\r\nto the Imperial Institute for examination and report, and proved to\r\nbe of good quality, and when subsequently sold, it obtained a high\r\nprice. This established confidence with regard to the possibility\r\nof fine grades being prepared in the country. During this year,\r\nowing to the action of the Fernando Po and San Thomé growers,\r\nin withholding their crop, a greater demand was created for Gold\r\nCoast cocoa, and the advent of large buyers, working outside the\r\n“combine,” forced the local price to a high figure. This did\r\nnot assist in the improvement of the quality, as the competition\r\ninduced native buying agents to buy the produce in almost any form,\r\nin consequence of which large quantities of imperfectly dried stuff\r\nwere obtained. On the market becoming steadier, many of the more\r\nintelligent natives realised the advantage of careful preparation,\r\nto which they are now turning their attention.\r\n\r\nTowards this latter result Messrs. Cadbury Bros., Ltd., rendered\r\ngreat assistance. This firm sent representatives into the country,\r\nwho proved to the natives that they were willing to pay an\r\nenhanced price for cocoa prepared in a manner suitable for their\r\nrequirements. A fair amount of cocoa was purchased by them, and\r\ndemonstrations were made in some places with regard to the proper\r\nmode of fermentation. In addition to this a number of seedlings\r\nof the _Criollo_ variety were given to the Agricultural Department\r\nfor experimental work at the Aburi Botanic Station.\r\n\r\nThe _Forastero-amelonado_ variety, a hardy but commercially inferior\r\nkind, has been mainly employed in plantations, and experiments\r\nhave been carried on for some years at Aburi with _Pentagona_,\r\n_Caracas_ and _Cundeamor_ besides _Criollo_ mentioned above. Such\r\ngood results were obtained with _Cundeamor_ that, in 1913, keen\r\ncompetition was aroused among planters to obtain seed. The years\r\n1913 and 1914 are said to have shown an improvement in the quality\r\nof the cocoa produced. The attention of the Agricultural Department\r\nhas been given to the general instruction of the natives in improved\r\nmethods of cultivation and preparation, both by means of lectures\r\nand demonstrations at the Botanic Stations and by the issue of\r\npamphlets in English and the Twi language. There was at first an\r\ninsufficient staff for instruction to be given except at the Botanic\r\nStations, and only those growers who lived in the vicinity were able\r\nto obtain benefit from it. After holding several conferences with\r\nchiefs and planters in the cocoa districts it became evident that\r\nthe appointment of European Travelling Instructors was necessary, and\r\nfollowing this the Government detailed certain officers for the work;\r\nthe object being that they should occupy a large portion of their\r\ntime in travelling through the country in order to give personal\r\ninstruction to the natives in correct methods of treating cocoa\r\nand other agricultural products. Persons selected by chiefs are now\r\ntrained to act as instructors in planting in their own native towns.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a large quantity of cocoa of even quality is so\r\ngreatly dependent upon the similarity of the treatment and conditions\r\nat a time when the material is undergoing fermentation and drying,\r\nthat it is almost imperative that a large quantity should be\r\nprepared at one operation. This is an important consideration\r\nin British West Africa, where native plantations range in size\r\nfrom a few trees to about five acres in extent, the average\r\nbeing perhaps about a hundred trees, or, roughly, one-tenth of\r\nan acre. The production of each plantation is at present prepared\r\nindependently, and the result of one picking of pods, if all mature,\r\nis often quite inadequate to yield sufficient for fermentation\r\npurposes, it being recognised that a few hundredweights of beans\r\nin their pulp are necessary for the satisfactory accomplishment\r\nof the operation. The same difficulty has presented itself in the\r\nWest Indies with regard to the crops picked by owners of small\r\nplantations, and arrangements are usually made by some larger\r\nconcern in the neighbourhood to purchase the pods from them. The\r\nestablishment of central fermenting and drying houses, controlled\r\nby the shippers themselves, would perhaps get over the difficulty\r\non the Gold Coast and result in a superior class of cocoa being\r\nproduced. The planters would doubtless consent to sell their pods,\r\ninstead of performing the laborious work of preparation themselves,\r\nand would probably be able to extend the size of their individual\r\nplantations, which, by reason of their inability to prepare more\r\ncocoa, single-handed, they have been unable, hitherto, to do. The\r\nefforts of the Administration to improve the preparation have been\r\nsomewhat handicapped by the system employed by some merchants of\r\nsecuring the crop for themselves, by money advances, with but little\r\nregard to its preparation, and of pooling the produce.\r\n\r\nCocoa planting has revolutionised the native system of land\r\ntitles. Where only annual crops were under consideration, a\r\nshort, temporary occupation with subsequent reversion to tribal\r\nownership seemed an adequate provision, but with the establishment\r\nof permanent cocoa plantations the planter claimed perpetual and\r\nundivided proprietorship.\r\n\r\nFurther information regarding Gold Coast cocoa will be found in the\r\n_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, 1907, p. 361; 1912, pp. 240,\r\n556; 1913, p. 154; 1914, p. 387; 1915, pp. 149, 645; 1916, p. 123;\r\n1917, p. 117; 1919, pp. 49, 102; and Johnson’s _Cocoa_, 1912.\r\n\r\n=Exports of Cocoa.=—The exports of cocoa from 1900 to 1919 are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  Year   Tons    Year    Tons    Year    Tons\r\n  1900     536   1907    9,355   1914    52,888\r\n  1901     980   1908   12,743   1915    77,278\r\n  1902   2,396   1909   20,213   1916    72,162\r\n  1903   2,276   1910   22,631   1917    90,964\r\n  1904   5,112   1911   39,726   1918    66,342\r\n  1905   5,093   1912   38,647   1919   176,155\r\n  1906   8,975   1913   50,554\r\n\r\n=RUBBER.= =Indigenous Species.=—The most important source of rubber\r\nin the Gold Coast and Ashanti is the indigenous tree locally called\r\n“Ofruntum”; a comparatively small amount is also derived from\r\nsome of the vines belonging to the same Natural Order, and from\r\none or more of the wild trees of the Ficus Order.\r\n\r\nReports on the quality and commercial value of some of the principal\r\nkinds of rubber obtained in the Gold Coast are published in the\r\n_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. v. (1907), p. 248.\r\n\r\n=Botanical Position of the “Ofruntum” Tree.=—The\r\n“Ofruntum,” or African rubber, is botanically placed in the\r\nNatural Order _APOCYNACEÆ_, under the specific name of _Funtumia\r\nelastica_, Stapf. Until recently it was referred to as _Kicksia\r\nafricana_, Benth. and others (a genus which is not known to occur\r\nin West Africa), and it was also confused with a very nearly allied\r\nspecies, occurring in the same localities, and now known as _Funtumia\r\nafricana_, Stapf. Owing to the great similarity which these species\r\nof Funtumia bear to one another, it is important that the differences\r\nbetween them should be recognised, _F. africana_ not furnishing any\r\nbut very inferior rubber. The most reliable method of testing the\r\nspecies which produces rubber, is by rubbing a small quantity of\r\nlatex between the finger and thumb, when small particles of rubber\r\nshould be quickly formed, the latex of _F. africana_ becoming\r\nonly a sticky mass under the operation. The leaf of _F. elastica_\r\ncan usually be recognised by the presence of a small pit at the\r\norigin of each secondary nerve or vein on the under-surface,\r\nwhich feature is not characteristic of the leaf of _F. africana_,\r\nalthough recently individual trees have been found exhibiting this\r\npeculiarity. The flower bud of _F. elastica_ is typically much\r\nshorter than that of _F. africana_, and the double seed pod of the\r\nformer species is shorter and more blunt than that of the latter.\r\n\r\n=Distribution of _F. elastica_.=—The Funtumia rubber tree occurs in\r\na wild state in the forests throughout the Gold Coast and Ashanti,\r\nalthough it has been nearly exterminated in some parts. It appears\r\nto be most plentiful in the dense forest regions of Northern Ashanti.\r\n\r\n=Native Methods for Preparing.=—Funtumia rubber is exported\r\nunder the names of “Ashanti lump” and “Niggers,” which\r\nconsist of much adulterated, evil-smelling substances, for which\r\na low price is procurable in comparison with that paid for pure\r\nrubber. In certain years the demand for this has been maintained,\r\nbut the adequate supplies of good rubber from elsewhere, and the\r\nrapid expansion of the cocoa industry, have caused a diminution\r\nin the export of native-made rubber, which has been replaced to a\r\nsmall extent by plantation rubber.\r\n\r\nThe wild trees grow from 50 to 100 feet in height, and often\r\nhave a girth of three feet at four feet from the base; the trunk\r\nbeing commonly without branches for a considerable height. The\r\nnative ascends the trunk by means of a sling passed round it,\r\nto one end of which is a loop which fits over his right thigh\r\nand to the other a stirrup in which he keeps his left foot. By\r\nmoving the rope up the tree the ascent is quickly accomplished,\r\nand when stationary, both hands are left free. The climber carries\r\na gouge, or semi-cylindrically-faced chisel, with which he cuts\r\nvertical as well as transverse oblique grooves, forming a rough\r\n“herring-bone” pattern, which may be continued for the whole\r\nlength of the trunk, and even extend on to the main branches. To\r\nmake the cuts the tool is either used in one hand or is held in\r\nthe left and driven by blows on the end of the handle, given with\r\nthe palm of the right hand. The flow of latex commences at once,\r\nand is directed down the vertical channel into a calabash placed\r\nat the base of the tree, into which the latex is guided by a lip of\r\nclay or a chip of wood. The illustration shows a native in Ashanti\r\ntapping a tree (Fig. 18). The quantity of latex procured at the\r\none tapping varies; an exceptionally large amount being about two\r\nquarts from a large tree. The tree is not tapped again for several\r\nmonths and until the wounds have healed. On the second tapping\r\nthe same form of cuts is made upon the opposite side of the tree,\r\nand the transverse channels often intersect those made previously;\r\nbesides this, owing to the want of regulation in the depth of the\r\ncuts, the inner or cambium layer of the bark may be so damaged that\r\nthe intersecting cuts may ring the tree and cause death. Few trees\r\nprobably survive the third or fourth tapping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “ODUM” TREES _CHLOROPHORA EXCELSA_.\r\n\r\nFig. 19, p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARA RUBBER TREE (_HEVEA BRASILIENSIS_), TAPPED\r\nAT ABURI.\r\n\r\nFig. 20, p. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUBBER TREE TAPPED, HERRING-BONE SYSTEM IMPERFECT,\r\nABURI.\r\n\r\nFig. 21, p. 61.]\r\n\r\nIf the herring-bone cuts were made carefully upon the lower part of\r\nthe trunk, and attention given to their depth and direction, the tree\r\nmight be preserved for a longer period. An illustration given shows\r\nthe incorrect mode of tapping, where the transverse cuts are opposite\r\ninstead of alternate (Fig. 21). Experiments seem to show that there\r\nis not the same “wound response” in the case of Funtumia trees\r\nas is found in that of the “Para” tree (_Hevea brasiliensis_);\r\nthe paring of the wounds some days after tapping yielding no flow\r\nof latex similar to that procured in the first instance. On cutting\r\nthe bark area between the transverse channels, the latex cells\r\nappeared to be empty and to indicate that a large area is drained\r\non the first tapping. Further investigation is necessary in order\r\nto compare the results obtained from this tree with those of _Hevea_.\r\n\r\nThe latex of Funtumia will remain in an uncoagulated state for\r\na longer time than that of Hevea, but it may become damaged\r\nby fermentation if a quantity is kept in bulk for a lengthened\r\nperiod. The native does not usually produce a pure Funtumia rubber,\r\nbut mixes with the latex the latices of several other plants, among\r\nwhich may be named “Odum” (_Chlorophora excelsa_), “Osese”\r\n(_Funtumia africana_), “Ofo,” “Okre,” “Sindru”\r\n(_Conopharyngia crassa_ and _Alstonia sp._). Having mixed some of\r\nthese latices with that of the Funtumia, the whole is heated and\r\npoured into a hole in the ground, which has been prepared to serve\r\nas a mould. Coagulation and decomposition proceed together at a slow\r\nrate, and finally produce a rubber containing a number of holes which\r\nserve as receptacles for the liquefied decomposed constituents. The\r\nrubber mass is black outwardly, but whitish within, and is more or\r\nless sticky. It is said that the latex of _Landolphia owariensis_,\r\nthe vine from which “Krepi ball” rubber is made, is sometimes\r\nmixed with the rest to hasten coagulation.\r\n\r\n=Improved Methods.=—In 1906 attention was drawn to the use of a\r\nplant called “Niama” in the Ivory Coast, by which Funtumia rubber\r\nlatex was coagulated by adding a hot decoction of the leaves. This\r\nplant was subsequently found to be _Bauhinia reticulata_, which bears\r\nthe name of “Otakataka” in the Gold Coast. Experiments with this\r\nafforded excellent results. An examination of the plant made at the\r\nImperial Institute proved that the tannin contained in the leaves was\r\nresponsible for the coagulation of the latex, and that the infusion\r\nof any plant containing tannin is equally effective. The obstacle\r\nto the general use of _B. reticulata_ for coagulation, is that the\r\nplant does not occur in the same localities as the wild Funtumia\r\ntree. Doubtless other tannin-yielding plants may be found in the\r\nrubber forests which would answer the purpose equally well, among\r\nthem the pods of _Acacia arabica_. A simple method of coagulation,\r\nwhich was demonstrated to the chiefs and rubber collectors in 1908,\r\nis that of diluting the latex with about four or more times the\r\nvolume of water, straining and boiling it, when the rubber quickly\r\nseparates and can be collected from the surface of the water by\r\nmeans of a stick and immediately pressed into a rough biscuit.\r\n\r\nThe rubber made in the manner mentioned above has been valued\r\nat more than twice the price obtained for the adulterated stuff,\r\nbut it appears difficult to persuade the local merchants to offer\r\na higher price for it, and it therefore suits the rubber collector\r\nbetter to make the inferior quality. So long as this state of things\r\ncontinues, it is to be feared that instruction in the improvement\r\nof quality will not lead to the adoption of better methods.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 a Commission of Enquiry was appointed and made certain\r\nrecommendations for legislation for the protection of the\r\nindustry. Articles on Gold Coast rubber will be found in the\r\n_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vols. viii. (1910), x. (1912),\r\nxi. (1913), xii. (1914), xii. (1915) and xv. (1917).\r\n\r\n=Plantations.=—Large numbers of Funtumia seedlings have been grown\r\nat and distributed from the Government Botanic Gardens at Aburi,\r\nTarkwa, and Kumassi, and some of the Ashanti kings and chiefs, who\r\nhave expressed a wish to attempt to renovate their rubber forests,\r\nhave obtained assistance from the officers of the Agricultural\r\nDepartment, who have conducted planting operations in the forests\r\nin the presence of those interested. Plantations under European\r\nmanagement and with European capital are in progress in the vicinity\r\nof Axim and Sekondi. Most of the recently made plantations are said\r\nto consist more of Para than of Funtumia rubber trees, although in\r\n1913 one of these in the Dunkwa district of Ashanti was reported to\r\ncontain 20,000 trees of the latter kind. The tree appears to thrive\r\nwell when planted closely, and straight trunks are soon formed.\r\n\r\n=Insect Pest.=—At Aburi and elsewhere the Funtumia tree is found\r\nto be attacked by the larva of a moth of the family _Pyralidæ_,\r\nidentified as _Glyphodes ocellata_, Hampson, which denudes it of\r\nleaves. No severe damage seems to be done by this pest, which has\r\nonly been observed in plantations, and was destroyed at Aburi by\r\nrepeated applications of lime and ashes.\r\n\r\n=Fungoid Pest.=—A sooty fungoid growth is sometimes seen upon the\r\nleaves, similar to that occurring on orange trees in the country,\r\nand probably belongs to the genus _Meliola_. It is destroyed by\r\nthe application of sprays of Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\n=Rubber Machinery.=—A fully equipped installation of rubber-washing\r\nand crêpeing machinery was exhibited at the Kumassi Agricultural\r\nExhibition of 1908, and was subsequently taken over by one of the\r\nleading mercantile firms at that place, where the local rubber\r\nis now washed, crêped, and pressed before export. It might prove\r\nadvantageous to come to an arrangement with the rubber collectors\r\nto bring the latex to Kumassi, where, under proper supervision,\r\nit could be made into rubber of high quality. As the latex will\r\nremain for a considerable time without alteration, it should not be\r\ndifficult to bring it in from places several days’ journey distant.\r\n\r\n=Vine Rubber.=—Several species of vines, belonging to the Natural\r\nOrder _APOCYNACEÆ_, produce rubber in Africa, but the only one of\r\ncommercial importance occurring in the Gold Coast is _Landolphia\r\nowariensis_, Pal. Beauv., from which “Krepi” or “White ball”\r\nis obtained. Unless the plant is observed during the flowering\r\nas well as the fruiting season, it is difficult to distinguish it\r\nfrom some nearly allied, but useless, species of the same genus,\r\nwhich are found commonly in the same localities.\r\n\r\nThe vine is found throughout the forest region of the Gold Coast\r\nand Ashanti, climbing over and interlacing the main branches of\r\nlarge forest trees; but an apparently terrestrial form of the same\r\nspecies has recently been discovered in the ultra-forest region,\r\nwhere the stunted habit in which it grows is probably occasioned\r\nby the annual grass fires.\r\n\r\nUnder different atmospheric conditions the latex of _L. owariensis_\r\nbehaves differently. In the drier regions it coagulates upon the\r\nwound almost immediately upon exposure to the air, whereas in other\r\nand moister places it runs from the cut in such a manner as to allow\r\nit to be collected in a vessel. The acid juices of some of the local\r\nwild fruits are added to hasten coagulation, when this is necessary,\r\nor the collector is said to smear the fresh latex upon his naked\r\nbody, until enough has been coagulated to form a small ball, which\r\nserves as a nucleus for winding on the strings of fresh latex as\r\nthe new cuts are made. There is a quantity of “scrap rubber”\r\nformed on the wedge-shaped cuts which it is usual to make, and this\r\nis added to the ball, which attains a diameter of three or four\r\ninches when complete. The crushing of the root and stem for the\r\nmanufacture of so-called “root-rubber” does not appear to be\r\npractised in this country, although common elsewhere in West Africa.\r\n\r\nOn account of the colour and form of this rubber, the name of\r\n“White ball” is usually applied to it, although, from the fact\r\nthat the Krepi tribes, living on the east bank of the Volta river,\r\nproduce a large quantity of it, the name of “Krepi ball” is\r\nfrequently given.\r\n\r\nWhite ball rubber is seldom adulterated by the addition of other\r\nlatices, as these would retard coagulation and interfere with the\r\npreparation of it in the manner mentioned. For this reason the\r\nrubber sold under this name usually obtains a higher price than\r\nother rubber.\r\n\r\n_Landolphia owariensis_ presents many disadvantages for cultivation\r\nin plantations, and the yield is small in proportion to the space\r\nwhich the plant occupies. Several species of this and allied genera\r\nare being grown experimentally at the Aburi Botanic Gardens.\r\n\r\n“Flake rubber” is a name given to a very inferior quality of\r\nrubber which is produced upon a small scale in many parts of West\r\nAfrica, but it has not been determined from which species of vine\r\nthat exported from the Gold Coast is obtained. In Northern Nigeria\r\n_Carpodinus hirsutus_, Hua, is said to be the source of the exported\r\nrubber of this name.\r\n\r\n=Fig Rubber.=—One or more species of wild fig trees (_Ficus\r\nsp._) are tapped for the production of what is locally termed\r\n“Memeluku” rubber, and it is generally supposed that _F. Vogelii_\r\nis that mostly employed. The trees attain a large size, and the\r\nrubber is composed of the scrap, collected from a large number of\r\nsmall cuts made on the trunk and branches. This scrap rubber is\r\npressed together into thick biscuits. The rubber has usually little\r\nresiliency and breaks easily; it is, in consequence, of small value.\r\n\r\n=Introduced Species.=—Experiments have been carried on for several\r\nyears with “Para” rubber (_Hevea brasiliensis_), “Ceara”\r\n(_Manihot Glaziovii_), and _Castilloa elastica_, all indigenous\r\nto South America. The last-named has been so badly attacked in\r\nthe Botanic Stations by boring beetle larvæ that it has shown\r\nno promise of success. Ceara grows well, but for some reason\r\nthe production of latex from it is uncertain, and this has caused\r\nlittle value to be attached to it in the Gold Coast, although in the\r\ndrier region of Togoland this species is being planted. Para rubber\r\nseems to show much better results, although, up to the present, no\r\nextensive experiments to ascertain the yield of rubber have been\r\nmade. Tapping two trees growing at Aburi, Mr. Johnson obtained a\r\nlarger quantity of latex than from _Funtumia elastica_ under the\r\nsame conditions; and following this an extensive area was planted\r\nwith Hevea trees at the Tarkwa Botanic Gardens, where the experiment\r\nappears to be proving successful. Views are given of a tree at Aburi\r\n(Fig. 20). Large plantations of Hevea are being made near Tarkwa,\r\nAxim and Sekondi as well as in the Kwahu district, where the tree\r\nseems to thrive remarkably well. A few of these plantations made\r\nreturns in 1913 showing promise of success. At one, on the Offin\r\nriver, there were said to be 90,000 Para trees of different ages,\r\n20,000 Funtumia and 6,000 coffee (_C. robusta_). At another the\r\nyield of rubber from a number of mature trees gave an average of\r\n1·08 lb. of dry rubber per tree in eight months’ tapping, and a\r\nthird had 22,000 Para trees of which about 8,450 had been tapped and\r\nyielded 10,565 lbs. of rubber, or 1¼ lb. per tree tapped. Labour\r\nwas reported plentiful and good. There are said to be many more\r\nrubber plantations in the country from which returns had not been\r\nreceived. Up to 1913 the Agricultural Department had distributed\r\n250,000 Para seedlings and 1,500,000 seeds.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the fluctuation in the exported amounts of rubber,\r\nHis Excellency the Governor (Sir Hugh Clifford), in his message\r\nto the Legislative Council in October 1918, explained the\r\nrecrudescence during 1916 and 1917 as due to the development of\r\nrubber plantations under European control. It remains to be seen\r\nwhether the Gold Coast will be able to successfully compete in\r\nthis work with the Far East. Articles on Para rubber from the Gold\r\nCoast are to be found in the _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. x. (1912), vol. xi. (1913), vol. xii. (1914), vol. xv. (1917)\r\nand vol. xvii. (1919).\r\n\r\n=PALM OIL AND KERNELS.=—Records are available showing that the\r\nexport of palm oil from West Africa has continued for over one\r\nhundred years, but the quantity shipped from the Gold Coast during\r\nthe last fifteen years shows a rapid decrease from the average of\r\nthe twenty years previous.\r\n\r\nThe tree which yields the oil of commerce is known as _Elæis\r\nguineensis_, Jacq., and is placed in the Tribe _COCOINEÆ_ of the\r\nNatural Order _PALMÆ_, together with the genus _Cocos_, to which\r\nthe Coconut palm belongs. (Cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1909, p. 357;\r\n1920, p. 209.)\r\n\r\n=Habits of the Oil Palm.=—The oil palm occurs most plentifully\r\nin the moist regions near the coast, although it will not thrive\r\non land which is perpetually marshy. The palm becomes scarcer when\r\nthe dense forests of Ashanti are reached, but it is not entirely\r\nabsent until the ultra-forest tract commences.\r\n\r\nThe tree often bears fruit when it has only attained the height of\r\nten feet, which it is said to do about the seventh year, but the\r\nyield is supposed to increase annually until the tree is thirty\r\nor more years old, often continuing for a much longer time. It\r\nis not possible to give any positive assurance on this point,\r\nas observations have not been recorded for any length of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the oil is principally obtained from wild trees, one\r\nextensive plantation in the Krobo Hills has been successfully\r\ncarried on for many years by the chief of Odumassi. His trees are\r\nplanted at regular intervals and care is given to their upkeep and\r\ncleanliness. Concessions have recently been granted to Europeans for\r\nplanting as well as exploiting the wild palms, and experimental work\r\nin the mechanical extraction of pericarp and kernel oil have given\r\nsome promise. Two British companies that have erected extraction\r\nplants in the Western Province have laid tram-lines designed to\r\nkeep them constantly supplied with the palm fruit.\r\n\r\nTrees that have become old and practically barren are usually tapped\r\nfor the extraction of “palm wine,” being frequently cut down for\r\nthe purpose. In some parts of the country fruitful trees are tapped\r\nwhile standing, and, as this necessitates the base of the terminal\r\nshoot being cut into, the tree is generally killed in consequence.\r\n\r\nTwo crops of fruiting heads are yielded by a tree in full bearing\r\neach year, but the autumn crop is heavier than the earlier one,\r\nand the aggregate weight of fruit yielded by a tree in one year is\r\ngenerally estimated at 40 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe fruiting heads consist of large bunches which hang from near\r\nthe crown of the tree, and each fruit is partly enveloped in a\r\nhusk-like covering. When removed from this it is found to be smooth,\r\nsomewhat conical or irregularly compressed, tapering towards an\r\nabrupt point. The colour when fresh varies from orange-red to\r\nnearly white, with a more or less broad black apex. In section\r\nit appears to be composed of a thick fibrous layer over a hard,\r\nsomewhat rounded stone, which contains a whitish kernel. It is\r\nfrom the fibrous portion, which is included in what is botanically\r\ntermed the pericarp, that the oil is obtained, but the kernel also\r\ncontains another valuable oil, for the extraction of which it is\r\nshipped to Europe to a large extent.\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Palm Oil.=—When the ripe head has been cut from\r\nthe tree, it is left upon the ground for a few days in order that a\r\nshrinkage in the fruits may occur, which renders them more easily\r\ndislodged from their husk-lined places. The fruit also becomes\r\nslightly dull in colour. The heads bearing the fruit are often\r\nbeaten to remove the latter, or they are individually broken out by\r\nhand. In order to facilitate the extraction of the fruit kernels, the\r\nfruits are usually buried in the ground in a pit lined with plantain\r\nleaves. Here they remain for from three weeks to a month, during\r\nwhich time decomposition is set up. The subsequent quality of the oil\r\nis dependent upon the degree to which this is allowed to proceed,\r\nrancid and thick oils resulting when it has been overdone. On the\r\nother hand, the higher the state of decomposition the greater is\r\nthe facility for separating the fibrous pulp from the stones. On\r\nremoving the fruits from the ground they are placed in an open vat\r\n(Fig. 15) and pounded by a number of people using long poles, after\r\nwhich they are covered up for several hours in order that the oil\r\nmay drain into the small well shown at the side. Several consecutive\r\npoundings are applied, until the fibrous pulp is quite separated and\r\nmost of the oil has drained out, after which the stones are combed\r\nout with the fingers, and the pulp is placed in a bag and pressed on\r\na horizontal bar until the oil flows from it into a pit below. The\r\noils from these extractions are boiled and cleared, and the residual\r\npulp is often placed in the boiling pot so as to extract as much oil\r\nas possible. This is the method employed at the Krobo Plantations,\r\nbut the operation varies slightly in different districts.\r\n\r\n=Kernel Oil=—The value of the kernel for the extraction of oil\r\nwas recognised at a much later date than the pericarp, although,\r\nin a few places in the Gold Coast, oil had probably been expressed\r\nfrom kernels for local consumption for some time. Among the Krobos\r\nthe medicine-men prevented the trade in kernels from becoming\r\nestablished for several years, but they were finally overruled by\r\nthe chiefs. A large and increasing trade in kernels continued for\r\na number of years, but this has fallen off to a small extent more\r\nrecently. The shell of the variety of kernel which appears to be\r\nthe most common in this country is usually thick, and the laborious\r\nwork of cracking each stone individually between two stones, in\r\nsuch a manner that the kernel is extracted in an unbroken state,\r\nprevents a larger quantity being prepared for sale, and results in\r\nmuch waste. Nut-cracking machines have been brought into the country,\r\nand are said to prove successful to some extent, but the native is\r\nnot in a position to use machinery, and most of the material shipped\r\nis extracted in the primitive method mentioned. Cf. _Bulletin of\r\nthe Imperial Institute_, vols. vii., viii. and xv. (1909-17). Before\r\nthe cracking can be accomplished without breaking the interior, the\r\nkernel requires to be exposed to the sun and thoroughly dried. Kernel\r\noil prepared in a native way is of two kinds, one which expressed\r\nwithout heat being white, whilst that made from the roasted kernels\r\nis dark brown. Both are made by pounding and grinding the kernel\r\ninto fine meal, the extraction of the one being effected by cold\r\nand the other by boiling water.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 a Special Committee was appointed to consider the position\r\nof the palm-kernel trade, chiefly with reference to the protection\r\nof the newly-established British oil-crushing industry against\r\nGerman competition; and it was considered advisable to recommend\r\nthe imposition of a differential export duty of £2 per ton on all\r\npalm kernels from British West African ports. The Colonies concerned\r\nimposed the duty at the rate mentioned and in some instances have\r\nsince supplemented it by a direct revenue-producing tax.\r\n\r\n=Commercial Uses.=—The chief commercial uses of the oils are for\r\nthe manufacture of soap, candles, and glycerine, some qualities of\r\npalm oil being made use of in the manufacture of tin plates. With\r\nimproved methods the supply of palm oil and kernels could be\r\nlargely increased.\r\n\r\n=Varieties of Oil Palms.=—In 1907 information was obtained from the\r\nImperial Institute that a variety of oil palm was being propagated in\r\nthe Kameruns the fruit of which contained a thin-shelled kernel and\r\nwas called “Lisombe.” Further investigation in the British West\r\nAfrican countries led to the discovery that a number of well-marked\r\nvarieties of _Elæis guineensis_ were distinguished by the natives,\r\nand were called by distinct names. Among these one possessed\r\na thin-shelled kernel, and, together with about eight others,\r\nhas been under investigation at the Imperial Institute, with the\r\nobject of ascertaining their respective merits. The thin-shelled\r\n“Lisombe” and the “Gamopale” varieties from the Kameruns\r\nhave recently been tried experimentally in the Gold Coast, and\r\nthe advantages they possess over the other kinds have been clearly\r\nestablished. From the descriptions given below of the more important\r\nvarieties found on the Gold Coast, it will be seen that particulars\r\nof the comparative weight of the fruit crop and the quality of\r\nthe oil yielded are required to determine the relative values. In\r\naddition the proportions of fruit- and kernel-oil of each as well\r\nas the facilities for extracting the kernel must be considered.\r\n\r\nA reference is given below to six varieties, which have been fully\r\nexamined at the Imperial Institute. The native names are given, and\r\nthe percentages have been calculated for comparison, from the more\r\nelaborate figures which have been published (_Bulletin Imperial\r\nInstitute_, vol. vii. [1909], p. 366; cf. also vol. xi. [1913],\r\np. 208).\r\n\r\nThe characteristic variations of each variety are as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. “Abe-pa.” Fruit large, orange-red, with or without black tip,\r\npericarp thin, nut large with thick shell. This is the commonest\r\nform in the country, and is probably identical with the variety\r\nfound in Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\n2. “Abe-dam.” Fruit of irregular shape, fairly large, bright\r\nred, pericarp slightly thicker than the last, nut large with a\r\nthick shell. This is not uncommon.\r\n\r\n3. “Abe-tuntum.” Fruit moderately large, dark purplish-black,\r\npericarp very thin, and nut with thick shell. Uncommon.\r\n\r\n4. “Abe-bobe.” Fruit usually rather small, red and black,\r\npericarp thick and soft, nut with a thin kernel (easily broken in\r\nthe teeth). Trees rather scarce. This is probably identical with\r\nthe “Lisombe” variety from the Kameruns.\r\n\r\n5. “Intermediate form between 2 and 4.” Similar to the last\r\nbut with a thicker shell to the nut.\r\n\r\n6. “Seedless kind.” A very rare kind, nearly corresponding with\r\nthe “Difumbe” variety from Angola, which, however, possesses\r\na kernel but no shell.\r\n\r\nThe following are the percentages based on the total weight of the\r\nfruit, in each case taken as 100:—\r\n\r\n          Name          Pulp  Contg.  Fibre  Nut   Contg.  Shell\r\n                               oil    etc.         Kernel\r\n\r\n  1. “Abe-pa”            30   20·13   9·87    70    19·6   50·4\r\n\r\n  2. “Abe-dam”          37·5  24·03   13·14  62·5  16·87   45·63\r\n\r\n  3. “Abe-tuntum”       32·5  14·33   18·17  67·5  17·55   49·95\r\n\r\n  4. “Abe-bobe”          63   36·02   26·98   37   19·98   17·02\r\n\r\n  5. “Interm. 2 and 4”   51   30·34   20·66   49   20·58   28·42\r\n\r\n  6. “Seedless”         100   76·00   24·00     rarely a trace\r\n\r\nNos. 4 and 5 seem to be most valuable from a commercial standpoint,\r\nalthough at present Nos. 1 and 2 are the most commonly used, owing\r\nto the comparative scarcity of the first two mentioned. No. 6\r\nis chiefly interesting from a botanical aspect, and is probably\r\nincapable of reproduction. The sacred palm known in the Gold Coast\r\nas “Abe-ohene,” and identical with “Ope-Ifa” of Southern\r\nNigeria, belongs to a new species called _E. Thompsonii_, Chev.,\r\nbut the fruits are not employed for the extraction of oil.\r\n\r\n=OTHER OIL SEEDS.=—Experiments were conducted at the Imperial\r\nInstitute in 1908 with the kernels of the “Crabnut” (_Carapa\r\nprocera_, D.C.). The kernels were found to contain nearly 50 per\r\ncent. of oil, which was reported to be worth about £20 10_s_. per\r\nton, but the residual cake could not be used for feeding purposes,\r\nowing to the presence in it of a bitter constituent, and, on account\r\nof the rather low manurial value, was estimated as worth only £2 per\r\nton (_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. vi., 1908, p. 362).\r\n\r\nThe oil seemed to be well suited for soap-making, but would not be\r\nsuitable for lubricating or for edible purposes. The nut does not\r\noccur in such profusion as to warrant profitable exportation from\r\nlocalities where the oil palm is found.\r\n\r\n=TIMBER.= =Mahogany.=—The most valuable and commonly exported\r\ntimber is that known in the European and American markets as\r\n“African Mahogany.” The value of that shipped from the Gold\r\nCoast in 1913 was estimated at £366,000.\r\n\r\nSeveral red woods are included under the name of Mahogany, but\r\nthe best quality is said to be obtained from _Khaya senegalensis_,\r\na large tree of the Natural Order _MELIACEÆ_. This tree is known\r\nby the native (Fanti) name of “Dubini.” In the same language\r\nthe names “Okumankra” and “Akwabohori” are applied to two\r\ntrees which are said to be exported as Mahogany, but of these the\r\nidentity has not yet been determined.\r\n\r\n=Other Timber-trees.=—The “Odum” tree (_Chlorophora excelsa_)\r\nproduces a hard and useful wood, which is much used in the forest\r\nregion, but is not often shipped (Fig. 19). In the dry country of\r\nthe Northern Territories _Pseudocedrela Kotschyi_ may be found of\r\nvalue as a red wood for decorative purposes.\r\n\r\nAmong the other trees which show evidence of yielding hard and\r\nuseful woods are “Ahedua” (_Cyanothyrsus sp._), “Opapeh”\r\n(_Afzelia africana_), and “Bako” (_Mimusops sp._). Information\r\nabout the working-quality and suitability for export of these and\r\nother Gold Coast timbers is given in the _Bulletin of the Imperial\r\nInstitute_, vol. viii., 1910. p. 232.\r\n\r\nThe largest, and consequently the most valuable, trees belonging to\r\nthe different species mentioned, are found in the western part of the\r\nGold Coast and Ashanti, and most of the mahogany logs are shipped\r\nfrom Sekondi, Axim, and other places farther to the westward. The\r\nPra and Ankobra rivers are utilised to float down the squared logs,\r\nwhich are then moored at the river mouths, to await shipment. The\r\nexport of logs is only limited by the facilities with which they\r\ncan be brought to a river or the railway, and large, valuable\r\ntrees are plentiful in many of the forests, although they would be\r\nunprofitable to fell and trim in some cases, owing to their remote\r\nsituations and the difficulties connected with conveyance.\r\n\r\n=KOLA.=—Kola-nut is the name usually applied to the fruit of a tree\r\nbelonging to the Natural Order _STERCULIACEÆ_, and the wild as well\r\nas the cultivated forms found in the Gold Coast and Ashanti are,\r\nprobably, all referable to the species _Kola acuminata_, R. The\r\nfruits or nuts are borne in large pods, each of which contains a\r\nvariable number. The nuts themselves are irregular in form, and\r\nhave an inconstant number of cotyledons, or seed divisions, varying\r\nfrom two to five. Some confusion seems to have been caused owing to\r\nthis variation, as well as on account of the colour and shape of the\r\nnuts. In some trees they are red, in others white, and others again\r\npink, and they may be elongate or nearly round. These, however,\r\nare not reliable as distinguishing characters, since nuts of the\r\nthree colours have been found on the same tree, and even in the same\r\npod. Analyses and commercial valuations of several varieties of kola\r\nnuts from the Gold Coast are published in _Selected Reports from the\r\nImperial Institute_, Part III., “Foodstuffs” (Colonial Reports,\r\nMisc., Cd. 5137, 1910), pp. 259-61; _vide_ also _Bull. Imp. Inst._,\r\nvols. x. (1912) and xvii. (1919).\r\n\r\nIn the forests to the north of Kumassi large wild kola trees are\r\nfound, and the nuts are collected by the natives inhabiting the\r\nvillages in the vicinity, where they are sold at from 6_d_. to\r\n9_d_. a hundred. In other places the trees are planted, commonly\r\non the outskirts of villages, especially in Akim and Kwahu.\r\n\r\nKola nuts are used in tropical Africa in the same manner as betel\r\nnuts are in Asia. Their taste is somewhat bitter, and the mastication\r\nof fresh nuts seems to increase the flow of saliva. Chewing kola\r\nnuts is resorted to by the natives in order to allay thirst, or\r\neven hunger, and for this reason they are in great demand among\r\nthe inhabitants of the Sudan, to which country they are largely\r\nexported, being carried by men and donkeys in caravans, which\r\ntravel from the forest limits of Ashanti through the Northern\r\nTerritories. The donkeys, which are chiefly used to transport the\r\nnuts, do not generally enter the forests, but the kola nuts are\r\npacked in elongated head-loads, in bamboo or palm-stalk frames,\r\nin which form they are carried to the place where the donkeys have\r\nbeen left. The caravans bring shea-butter, guinea corn, cattle,\r\nand skins, which they exchange for kola.\r\n\r\nThe weight of nuts exported from the Gold Coast is about 50 per\r\ncent. above that of Sierra Leone, but, in value, the latter are worth\r\nfrom three to five times as much per ton. The fresh nuts are shipped\r\nto Lagos and are transported far into the interior by Haussa traders.\r\n\r\n=COTTON.=—No record is available to show when the tribes of the\r\nforest country commenced to cultivate and use cotton for local\r\nrequirements. It has been stated that the people of the kingdoms\r\nof the Western Sudan were acquainted with the uses of the fibre,\r\nand have cultivated the plant, from a remote period, and it is\r\nprobable that contact with these people, during their expeditions\r\nagainst the tribes to their south, led to the adoption by the\r\nlatter of cotton-growing upon the small scale in which it still\r\nremains at present. Cruickshank, writing of the Fantis in 1853,\r\nsays: “They spin the thread from the cotton which grows in\r\nthe country, but they more commonly make use of the thread out\r\nof English cloths, which they pick to pieces.” In speaking of\r\nthe Appolonians, a tribe inhabiting the coast region near Axim,\r\nCruickshank remarks that they “make fine grass cloths, which are\r\nstrong and durable.” In Ashanti, until recently, a cloth was\r\ncommonly made from the inner bark of a tree, generally supposed\r\nto be _Antiaris toxicaria_ var. _africana_, which was produced by\r\nthe removal of the woody portions by beating, leaving a pliable\r\nmaterial composed of the interlacing fibres. These instances are\r\ncited to show that the value of cotton for cultivation has not been\r\nrecognised by some of the large and dominant tribes in comparatively\r\nrecent times. Since cotton clothing has begun to be appreciated,\r\nthe necessity of growing the plant and weaving has been somewhat\r\nchecked by the large imports of finished material from Europe.\r\n\r\nThroughout the forest region occasional plants of cotton may be\r\nseen growing near villages, but the systematic cultivation of the\r\nplant is only met with on the outer northern boundary of the dense\r\nforest and in the Krepi country to the east of the Volta river. The\r\ninhabitants of the northern forest boundary are a mixed people,\r\nmany of whom have probably been driven from the countries farther\r\nnorth, where cotton is a recognised field crop, whence they have\r\nintroduced the cultivation. The adoption of cotton-growing by the\r\nKrepi tribes may be due to similar reasons, although there appears\r\nto be no evidence in support of this conjecture.\r\n\r\nIn the last-named places the seed is sown in rows on the tops of\r\nridges, on the sides of which maize plants may be also grown, but\r\nit is not uncommon to find cotton plants growing alone. This is\r\nespecially the case on the northern limits of Ashanti. The large\r\nvarieties grown in these places are often left in the ground for\r\na second season and produce two crops, the last of which is said\r\nto be inferior. No system of rotation has been observed, although\r\nit is probable that the cotton is planted during the early years\r\nof cultivation immediately following the yam crop, which is the\r\npractice in some other West African countries.\r\n\r\nThree distinct forms or varieties of cotton are cultivated in the\r\nforest region. The first variety is usually referred to as “Green\r\nseed,” and is the commonest one grown. The lint is long-stapled\r\nand nearly white, but experiments seem to show that this form does\r\nnot yield heavily. The second form is recognised by the seed being\r\ndark brown or black, without any fuzz, except a small brown tuft at\r\nthe apex, which has a sharp spike. The lint of this kind is creamy\r\nwhite, and the plant is known as “Volta.” The third form differs\r\nin having the dark brown seeds adjoining one another, and forming a\r\nconical mass, from which it is difficult to separate the individual\r\nseeds. At the point of connection each seed bears a small light brown\r\npatch. This form is generally known to the officers at the British\r\nCotton Growing Association plantation as “Kidney.” All these\r\nvarieties are cultivated throughout the forest country, and extend\r\nto some distance beyond; being replaced in the drier parts of the\r\nNorthern Territories by a small plant with a white woolly seed. No\r\ncotton in a wild state has been seen in the country, and isolated\r\nplants, found springing up in open places surrounded by forest,\r\nare generally easily traceable to formerly existing cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe “Green seed,” “Volta,” and “Kidney” cottons,\r\nwhich are grown in the Gold Coast, are different in habit from\r\nthe American and Indian plants, although in form they are similar\r\nto Sea Island and Egyptian, having, perhaps, arisen from the same\r\noriginal stock. The forms mentioned as cultivated locally attain\r\nthe height of from seven to ten feet in nine months from the time\r\nof planting, and the stem near the base is often thicker than a\r\nman’s wrist. The cotton bolls continue to open for three months\r\nor more, and often as many as two hundred bolls are produced on a\r\nsingle plant in one season. If left for a second year the bolls are\r\ngenerally diminished in size. The soil which appears most favourable\r\nfor growth is a sandy loam containing much humus.\r\n\r\nFrom January to April the bolls ripen continuously, and the cotton\r\nis placed in the sun as soon as it is picked, in order that the\r\n“Seed bugs” may be driven out. In native markets small quantities\r\nare usually exposed for sale in an unginned form throughout the\r\nharvesting season. No gin seems to be in use in the Gold Coast for\r\nnative work, and the lint is pulled off the seeds by hand when a\r\nsupply is required for spinning.\r\n\r\nThe greatest damage is done by “Seed bugs” of three\r\nspecies—_Oxycarenus hyalinipennis_, _O. Dudgeoni_, and\r\n_O. gossipinus_—that infest the lint as soon as the bolls open,\r\nand undergo their complete and rapid metamorphoses during the period\r\nbetween the opening and the throwing out of the cotton, feeding\r\nmeanwhile upon the juices which they suck from the seeds. The injury\r\ncaused by the puncturing of the seed often renders it unfertile. A\r\n“cotton stainer” is also common on the plants, and damages the\r\nunopened bolls by puncturing, and the lint by a yellowish stain\r\nwhich it makes. This insect is known as _Dysdercus nigrofasciatus_,\r\nand it is at least four times as large as any of the species of\r\n_Oxycarenus_, on which it may possibly feed to some extent.\r\n\r\nAn attempt was evidently made, in the middle of the last century,\r\nto establish the cultivation of cotton for export, and Cruickshank\r\nmentions that an association had taken the matter up, and that\r\nseveral of the native chiefs were beginning to give it their\r\nattention about that time. Very little success seems to have attended\r\nthese efforts.\r\n\r\nAbout 1903 the Government of the Gold Coast commenced the plantation\r\nof an area in the Krepi country, at a place called Anum, and, under\r\nthe control of the Agricultural Department, this was transferred\r\nto a better site soon afterwards, at a place named Labolabo on\r\nthe east bank of the Volta river. In addition to the extension of\r\nabout two hundred acres of land, which were planted with native and\r\nAmerican varieties of cotton, encouragement was given to the natives\r\nin the vicinity to grow more, on the understanding that their crops\r\nwould be purchased from them at one penny per pound. Unfortunately\r\nno arrangements had been made to store or gin a large quantity of\r\nseed cotton, and the entire native crop could not be taken over when\r\nbrought in. This seems to have induced the native growers to convey\r\nmost of their cotton into Togoland, where they were able to dispose\r\nof it at a fair price. Arrangements had to be made with a local\r\nfirm possessing a ginning machine, which was erected about sixty\r\nmiles lower down the Volta river, by which, on payment of a certain\r\nrate, the seed cotton grown on the Labolabo plantation was ginned\r\nand prepared for shipment. It was soon recognised that the expense\r\nof transport of the seed cotton for this distance, and the price\r\ncharged for ginning, prevented the production of cotton for export\r\nexcept at a heavy financial loss. The co-operation of the British\r\nCotton Growing Association was asked for, in order to supply gins\r\nat Labolabo, and in 1906 three hand gins were sent from the Gold\r\nCoast Exhibition, which had just been held. The machines were much\r\ndamaged in transit, and it was some time before the large stock\r\nof seed cotton, which had accumulated, could be worked off. Soon\r\nafter this the Labolabo plantation was transferred entirely to the\r\nBritish Cotton Growing Association, and an annual grant was made by\r\nthe Government to assist in the working. In 1907 a large steam-power\r\nginnery was put up, and the native farmers again began to bring in\r\ntheir seed cotton for sale, but still a considerable quantity was\r\nreported to be diverted to Togoland, where the price offered was\r\na fraction higher than that paid by the Association.\r\n\r\nThe cotton bales are transported from the ginnery by means of native\r\ncanoes as far as Amedika, which is the highest point on the Volta\r\nto which small steamers can ascend, but great risk is entailed in\r\ndescending the rapids between Labolabo and this place. The cost\r\nof carriage by native canoe is arranged at twenty shillings a ton,\r\nand the bales are pressed into a suitable form for conveyance.\r\n\r\n=American and other Exotic Cottons at Labolabo.=—A large number\r\nof different kinds of American cottons have been tried at Labolabo,\r\nbut most of them have proved unsuccessful. Those which yielded a\r\ngood crop for the first year have generally been found to produce\r\nseed, which, owing to the greater susceptibility of the plants to the\r\nattacks of insects, refused to germinate in the following year. Some\r\nof the lint produced was, apparently, of excellent quality and sold\r\nwell, but the necessity for the renewal of seed each year formed a\r\nserious obstacle to the establishment of a new variety. The plants\r\nfrom American seed are not so hardy as those from native seed, and\r\nthe necessity for greater care in cultivation renders them unsuitable\r\nfor use by the natives. Sea Island and various Egyptian cottons\r\nhave not proved successful. See _British Cotton Cultivation_, by\r\nProfessor Dunstan (“Colonial Reports,” Miscellaneous, Cd. 3997,\r\n1908, pp. 28-30), and the _Bulletins of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvols. vii., x., xi., xiii., xiv. (1909-16).\r\n\r\n=Attempts at Hybridisation.=—In the early days of the plantation\r\nthe Agricultural Department made several experiments with a\r\nview to the establishment of a cross between the native and the\r\nAmerican plants, but the subsequent changes in the management of\r\nthe plantation resulted in the disappearance of most of these;\r\nsubsequently several others were attempted in 1906 and 1907 by\r\nMr. Fisher.\r\n\r\nIn all cases plants of the “Green seed” or the “Volta”\r\nnative forms were made use of as female parents, and the descendant\r\nplants partook of the characters of the native forms in every way\r\nfor the first generation, but in later generations seem to have\r\nproduced a number of various types, from which it is now necessary\r\nto make a careful selection. The quantity of lint yielded by the\r\nfirst generation of plants, from the experiments made by Mr. Fisher\r\nin 1906, is said to have reached a higher figure, per acre, than\r\nthat of any other form grown on the plantation, and the quality\r\nwas satisfactory; but that of the second generation appeared to be\r\nunequal in type, and could scarcely be compared for quantity owing\r\nto the unfavourable season. The American plants used for pollination\r\nin the 1906 crosses were those which have given the best results\r\namong the exotic forms planted, and are called “Black Rattler”\r\nand “Richmond.” Of the four crosses attempted in that year,\r\nthat of “Black Rattler” × “Volta” was said to have proved\r\nthe most successful in point of yield.\r\n\r\nSmall plots of native and American cottons have been planted at\r\nKumassi, and experimental plants at Aburi, but the conditions have\r\nnot been so favourable at these places as at Labolabo. At Obuassi,\r\nin Ashanti, an attempt was also made, but the soil seemed too stiff\r\nand the plants were not healthy. Land suitable for native cotton\r\nfarms seems to be that on the west bank of the Volta river, north\r\nof the Labolabo plantation.\r\n\r\n=Valuations of Samples examined at the Imperial Institute.=—The\r\nfollowing selection of specimens of Gold Coast cottons examined and\r\nreported on at different times by the Imperial Institute will give\r\nsome indication of the relative values:—\r\n\r\n                                                           Standard\r\n                                                          at time of\r\n   Place        Variety               Staple    Value      valuation\r\n                                                         “Middl.

In the same part of the\r\ncountry palm oil and rubber are easily collected, and, besides being\r\nmore remunerative products, require comparatively small exertion\r\nin preparation. An attempt to establish cotton cultivation upon\r\na commercial scale, among the industrious people of the Northern\r\nTerritories, was made by the British Cotton Growing Association,\r\nbut the immense distances of the inhabited tracts from a shipping\r\nport and the consequent expense of transport, combined with the\r\nuncertainty of the rainfall in these ultra-forest regions, compelled\r\nthe abandonment of the venture in 1916.\r\n\r\n=FIBRES.=—Piassava fibre, which has sometimes been called\r\n“vegetable whalebone,” is prepared from the sheath of the lower\r\nparts of the leaf-stem of a tree belonging to the Natural Order\r\n_PALMÆ_, and classified as _Raphia vinifera_, P. Beauv. This tree\r\nis found growing in the vicinity of streams, and occurs commonly\r\nin the forest regions near the coast.\r\n\r\nThe natives prepare the fibre, which is sold in the European markets\r\nunder the name of “Piassava,” by cutting the stem-sheaths and\r\nsteeping them in water for a considerable time until the fibrous\r\nstrands are easily separated by beating. After being extracted in\r\nthis manner they are dried in the sun. Only a small quantity is\r\nexported from the country, but it is a more important article of\r\nexport from Sierra Leone and Liberia. As the specific name denotes,\r\nwine is extracted from the tree, by tapping the standing or felled\r\ntree, in the last case with the aid of fire.\r\n\r\nOn the estate of the African Plantations, Ltd., near Axim,\r\na fibre of excellent quality, commercially allied to jute, has\r\nbeen prepared from the stems of a herbaceous plant, which was\r\nsupposed to be _Triumfetta semitriloba_, Linn., but which has since\r\nbeen determined at Kew to be _T. cordifolia_ var. _Hollandii_,\r\nSprague. The plant belongs to the same Natural Order as Indian\r\njute—namely, _TILIACEÆ_. A description of this fibre is given\r\nin the _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. vi. (1908), p. 241.\r\n\r\nThis species has been observed commonly in a wild state in the\r\nforests near Sekondi and Axim, but does not seem to be present in\r\nthe interior of Ashanti or in the country towards the Volta river.\r\n\r\nExperiments made at the estate of the African Plantations, Ltd.,\r\nare said to show that the best fibre is obtained from stalks which\r\nhave been retted or steeped in water for five days, but it will\r\nprobably be found that the period required for the operation is\r\ndependent to a great extent upon the age of the stalks used.\r\n\r\nThe fibre may be prepared by stripping the bark layers from the\r\nsoaked stalks and beating these upon the surface of the water until\r\nthe actual bark is removed, when the fibre may be dried in the\r\nsun; being finally picked over to get rid of the small remaining\r\nbark particles.\r\n\r\nThe plant exhibits some advantages for cultivation over jute,\r\nin that it may be cropped twice in one year and treated as a\r\nperennial. Collection of the wild growths would be unsatisfactory\r\nfor the production of the fibre upon a large scale, owing to the\r\ntime occupied in searching for the plants, but it seems probable\r\nthat the plant would repay planting, especially if some better\r\nmethod of extraction were devised.\r\n\r\nThe composition, quality, and commercial value of a large number\r\nof fibres obtained from plants indigenous to, or cultivated in,\r\nthe Gold Coast are discussed in _Selected Reports from the Imperial\r\nInstitute_, Part I., “Fibres” (Colonial Reports, Miscellaneous,\r\nCd. 4588, 1909), pp. 43, 51, 84, 89, 90, 115.\r\n\r\n=SILK.=—A species of wild silkworm is commonly distributed\r\nthroughout the forests to the north of Kumassi, and has been\r\nidentified as _Anaphe venata_. The silk cocoons of this species\r\nand those of _Anaphe infracta_ are used in Nigeria for spinning\r\ninto yarn for weaving the “Saṉyaṉ” cloths of that country,\r\nbut no use is apparently made of them in Ashanti. The worms live in\r\nsmall colonies, and form their cocoons in a common envelope of silk,\r\nfrom which two or three somewhat tubular processes project to enable\r\nthe moths to emerge when the time arrives. The food plant of the\r\nsilkworm has not been definitely ascertained, but, as the cocoons\r\nare found on a large number of herbaceous plants as well as trees,\r\nit seems probable that several plants are eaten by it. The quality\r\nof the silk is said to be good, and the colour is usually a golden\r\nor light brown.[3]\r\n\r\n=COPAL.=—The tree which produces this resin, often miscalled\r\n“gum,” which is commercially known as “Accra copal,”\r\noccurs throughout the forests of Ashanti and Akim, and has not\r\nyet been specifically determined. Investigations have shown that\r\nit is allied to _Cyanothyrsus oblongus_, Oliver, which yields the\r\n“Ogea” resin of Lagos, and which belongs to the Natural Order\r\n_LEGUMINOSÆ_. The flowers obtained from the Ashanti trees are of\r\na similar construction to those of _Cyanothyrsus_.\r\n\r\nLocally the resin is commonly used for torches and for the\r\npreparation of a scented pigment called “Krobo,” which is used\r\nfor elaborating patterns upon the skin, being commonly employed\r\nby the Akim people for this purpose. For export the chief value is\r\nfor the preparation of varnish.\r\n\r\nThe quantity exported reached 178 tons in 1907, after which it\r\ndeclined, and now no longer reaches a significant figure. The\r\noverwhelming interest attracted by cocoa has led to its\r\ndisappearance. Cf. _Selected Reports Imperial Institute_, pt. ii.,\r\n“Gums and Resins” (Col. Rep. Misc., Cd. 4971, 1909), pp. 172-5;\r\n_Bull. Imp. Inst._, vol. xii. (1914), p. 220.\r\n\r\nThe copal-yielding trees are generally of immense size, and the\r\nresinous liquid may be observed exuding from the main trunk as well\r\nas the branches, in such a way as to form elongated “tears”\r\nor slabs, which harden on exposure to the air. When these become\r\nbrittle they are broken off by wind and fall to the ground. Often\r\nthe flow of resinous liquid seems to be so profuse that quantities\r\nreach the ground and form what is termed “fossil copal,” owing\r\nto the fact that it is dug from the ground beneath the trees.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that in some instances the original flow of\r\nthe resinous liquid is caused by deep borings in the sap wood made by\r\ninsect larvæ (probably _Coleoptera_—beetles), signs of which are\r\ncommonly apparent on old trees, which yield the most copal. Specimens\r\nof branches, which have been tunnelled by these larvæ, have been\r\ncollected, exhibiting all the cavities filled with hardened resin.\r\n\r\nCompared with the copal produced by _Copaifera Guibourtiana_, a\r\ntree which is found in Sierra Leone, the Ashanti product is much\r\ninferior, although the price paid renders it sufficiently valuable\r\nfor collection and export. Several different types of the Accra\r\ncopal are known, some of which appear to be of less value than\r\nothers, although apparently yielded by the same tree. That which is\r\ndeemed preferable is clear and pale yellow; milky pieces should be\r\nsorted out, as they are valued at a lower figure. Blocks have been\r\nobtained which weighed over twenty pounds. Sorting is said to have\r\nbeen adopted by some of the local merchants, and as high a price as\r\n60_s_. per cwt. is reported to have been obtained for sorted copal.\r\n\r\n=COPRA.=—Some special attention has been given to the extension of\r\nthe copra industry on the coast, and it will be observed that the\r\naverage annual exports have nearly doubled during the last eight\r\nyears. The coconut (_Cocos nucifera_) is found on the greater part\r\nof the coastline, and the dried contents of the nut constitute\r\nthe product known as copra. (Cf. _Oil Seeds and Feeding Cakes_,\r\nImp. Inst. Monograph, 1915.) No use is apparently made of the fibrous\r\ncovering of the nuts, which is exported from other parts of the world\r\nunder the name of coir. Locally the nuts are cut down in an unripe\r\ncondition, and the “milk” from the interior is used as a drink.\r\n\r\n=DYES AND PIGMENTS.=—Camwood is the trade name applied to the\r\nwood of a tree known as _Baphia nitida_, Afzelius, belonging to the\r\nNatural Order _LEGUMINOSÆ_. It has been suggested that the bright\r\nred colouring-matter is produced by decomposition on exposure to\r\nair, the material shipped from different places in West Africa\r\nbeing apparently in this condition, but investigations in other\r\nparts of West Africa show that the fresh wood is frequently used in\r\nmaking the colouring-matter. A very small quantity is exported from\r\nthe Gold Coast, but the natives make some use of it for staining\r\ndifferent materials.\r\n\r\n=Indigo.=—This is prepared from two or three species of\r\n_Indigofera_, which are found growing near villages, but the\r\nprocess of preparation in the Gold Coast does not appear to have\r\nbeen recorded, though probably similar to that employed in the\r\nother West African countries.\r\n\r\nThe resin from the copal tree, mentioned above, is crushed, together\r\nwith the bark of a tree called “Krobo,” in Akim especially,\r\nand the balls formed from this mixture are rubbed down, with the\r\naddition of a little water, into a fine sort of lather, when a\r\ngreenish-grey-coloured thin paste is procured. With this designs\r\nare traced upon the body and arms as an adornment for women, the\r\nresin imparting to the mixture a pleasant odour.\r\n\r\n=FIELD CROPS.=—The soil throughout a large part of the forest\r\ncountry is very fertile, and no difficulty is experienced in\r\nproducing sufficient crops for local needs from a small area of\r\nground. The usual method is to cut down a piece of forest, leaving\r\nthose trees which are too large to be removed or burnt, or which\r\nmay yield one of the wild fruits which is appreciated. The stumps\r\nand roots are not removed when only maize (_Zea mays_) is intended\r\nto be grown, but are, to some extent, when yams (_Dioscorea sp._),\r\nor groundnuts (_Arachis hypogea_), are to be cultivated. The\r\ncut “bush” is permitted to dry in the sun for several weeks,\r\nwhen it is burned, and the ashes are sometimes scattered over the\r\nland. For plantations of maize, the soil is only turned up at the\r\nspots where the seed is to be put in, and very little cultivation is\r\ngiven for the remainder of the year, although weeding and earthing\r\nup are resorted to in a few places. For the cultivation of yams or\r\ngroundnuts, the larger roots are dug out, and the whole field is dug\r\nwith small hoes, the soil being scraped together into small mounds,\r\non the top of which the yams or groundnuts are planted. In the\r\ncase of the former, stakes are also put in, upon which the yams are\r\ntrained to grow. In addition to this it is usual, in most places,\r\nto plant maize upon the sides of the mounds, and okra (_Hibiscus\r\nesculentus_) and peppers (_Capsicum sp._) in various parts of the\r\nfield. Guinea corn (_Sorghum vulgare_) is rarely seen within the\r\nforest limits. Between the mounds, at wide intervals, plantains\r\n(_Musa sapientum_) are generally grown, and occupy the ground after\r\nall the other crops have been removed. In the country near the coast,\r\nas well as in the Volta district, cassava (_Manihot utilissima_)\r\nis a common terminal crop, although it is not frequently grown in\r\nAshanti. The length of time during which the land usually continues\r\nto yield a grain or root crop, of the kinds above mentioned, seems\r\nlimited to about three years. Koko yams (_Colocasia antiquorum_)\r\nare planted in damp places near the villages or beside streams,\r\nand, in the Volta district, sweet potatoes (_Ipomœa batatas_)\r\nare cultivated to a small extent. Small gourds (_Cucurbitaceæ_)\r\nare cultivated in the villages, but are not common, and pineapples,\r\npaw-paws, guavas, oranges, custard apples, sour-sops, and limes may\r\nbe found growing in the places near the older European settlements.\r\n\r\nPlantains and yams seem to form the chief food of the people in\r\nthe interior, but maize is largely used by those near the coast,\r\nwho are better cultivators. Plantains are prepared by roasting or\r\nby chopping up and boiling. In some parts, especially in the Krepi\r\ncountry, the fruits are split and cut in pieces, after which they\r\nare dried in the sun. They become hard and white in the process,\r\nand can be kept for some time. Yams of several kinds are cut up\r\nafter peeling, and boiled with peppers or made up with palm oil,\r\nwhen they form a favourite dish. They are sometimes pounded in a\r\nwooden mortar and made into balls. Maize is ground on flat or grooved\r\nstones by means of a stone hand-roller, after which the flour is\r\nmade into dough and baked, a little palm wine having been added\r\nto make it rise. Cassava is treated in the same manner as yams,\r\nbut the former requires long soaking before cooking. Palm oil or\r\ngroundnut oil is generally used for cooking, and the pulp of the\r\npalm fruit, after the oil has been removed, is eaten. A fermented\r\ndrink is made from maize, which is said to taste like weak beer,\r\nbut the chief intoxicant made locally is the fermented juice of\r\nthe oil and the fibre palms.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of cotton, which has been separately referred to,\r\ngroundnuts appear to have been the only field crop of importance\r\nthat has been exported. In 1908 a substantial figure was reached,\r\nbut has since declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PART II.—THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES\r\n\r\n=Tribes.=—The country which is included under the Northern\r\nTerritories is inhabited by a number of tribes, now chiefly located\r\nin the northern half; the central portion being liable to inundation\r\nat certain times, and therefore almost unoccupied, and the southern\r\nbeing, perhaps, considered unsafe owing to the proximity to the\r\nwarlike Ashantis. The more important tribes are the Mamprussis,\r\nunder the king of Gambaga; the Gonjas, under the king of Kombe;\r\nthe Walas, under the king of Wa; and two sections of the Dagombas,\r\nunder the chiefs of Savelugu and Karaga (formerly under the king\r\nof Yendi, in German territory). The Lobis, Dagartis, Grunshis,\r\nKussassis, and several others were dispersed by Samory and Barbetu\r\nin 1896 and 1898, and have now only nominal chiefs. (See _Colonial\r\nReports—Annual_, No. 566, “Northern Territories of the Gold\r\nCoast,” 1907, p. 8.) The Moshis, whose country extended into\r\nthe northern limits of the Northern Territories, were employed\r\nat one time as native levies, but since they were disbanded they\r\nhave interfered with the tribes on the Gambaga-Kumassi road, in the\r\nSapari Hills, and made trading by that route unsafe. (See _Colonial\r\nReports_, _loc. cit._, p. 10.) Steps have been taken to expel them\r\nfrom the country, and it is hoped that the people living in the\r\nhills, who are said to be good agriculturists, will now come into\r\ncloser contact with civilisation. The Dagombas are apparently the\r\nmost industrious tribe in the country, and they seem to be numerous.\r\n\r\nAlthough there does not appear to be any actual record of the\r\ninvasion of the eastern part of the country by the Mohammedan\r\nrulers of the Western Sudan, they are said to have overrun the\r\npagan countries between themselves and the region of dense forest\r\non several occasions. In 1483 the kingdom of Mossi (Moshi) was\r\nconquered by Sonni Ali, King of Songhay, who was a native of the\r\nEastern Sudan, and had come from Egypt. Two years later he extended\r\nhis conquest through the mountain territory to the south and far into\r\nthe pagan belt. Sonni Ali was followed by Askia, who again overran\r\nMossi, in order to abolish paganism and establish the Mohammedan\r\nfaith. This occurred in about the year 1500, and doubtless the\r\npeople learnt to adopt the improved methods of agriculture which\r\nthe conquerors had introduced into the Western Sudan from Egypt\r\nand the east. Many of the tribes have relapsed completely into\r\npaganism, but amongst others there is a mixture of Mohammedanism and\r\npaganism, which is evidence of the impression made. More recently,\r\nSamodu Almami of Ouassoulou, generally known as Samory, was driven\r\nfrom his kingdom in the Western Sudan by the French, and overran\r\nthe Northern Territories with his Sofa troops; subduing Wa, Bole,\r\nand the whole of the western part of the country. It is, however,\r\nunlikely that agriculture was further improved by his invasion,\r\nas large tracts of country were devastated to feed his troops.\r\n\r\n=FIELD CROPS.=—The soil is of a lighter and more sandy nature than\r\nthat generally found in the forest region, but it is well adapted\r\nfor the cultivation of many different kinds of crops, notably Guinea\r\ncorn, millet, groundnuts, and cotton, while it is less satisfactory\r\nfor yams. The latter are consequently of smaller size.\r\n\r\n=Cotton.=—The cotton grown by the Dagombas is whiter than\r\nthose found in the south, and the plants are of small stature;\r\nthe species has a wide-opening pale flower, and has been grown\r\nat Labolabo from seed procured in the Northern Territories. The\r\ncotton fields are planted with regular lines of plants, and the\r\nground appears to be exclusively used for the crop during the\r\nseason. The seed is sown upon ridges which have been constructed\r\nfrom the high conical mounds, upon which the combined crop of\r\nmillet (_Pennisetum spp._) or Guinea corn and yams were grown in the\r\nprevious year. Cultivation is performed by means of a short-handled\r\nhoe, and the ridges are kept clear of weeds and grass until the\r\ncrop is ready. The seed-cotton is sold in the markets, and is in\r\ngood demand for the manufacture of native cloths. No insect pests\r\nhave been observed attacking the plants, and it is probable that if\r\nan outside demand were established for the produce a large quantity\r\ncould be grown. It might be necessary to introduce a better variety\r\nthan that at present cultivated, as this yields a rather coarse and\r\nshort staple. If cotton from this part of the country is to become\r\nan article of export, the difficulties at present experienced in\r\ntransport will first have to be overcome; indeed, this applies\r\nto all the produce capable of being grown in the country. The\r\nnavigation of the Volta river and the two main branches seems to\r\nsuggest a means which might be employed, for, although there are\r\nseveral rapids in the course from Daboya and Bole to Labolabo,\r\nonly one is impassable for canoes, even in the dry season. This\r\nrapid is at Krachi where a short line has been laid for transporting\r\nloaded canoes. The cost of the hire of canoes for making the journey\r\nwould probably be prohibitive, but if the British Cotton Growing\r\nAssociation undertook the carriage by their own canoes of the salt\r\nand stores required by the merchants who have commenced business in\r\nYeji and Tamale, the freight on these in the journey upwards would\r\nprobably be found to cover the cost of bringing cotton down-stream,\r\nand the export trade in it could be developed in this manner. The\r\nBritish Cotton Growing Association made an effort to act upon the\r\nsuggestion made here, but discontinued their operations in July 1916,\r\nwhen they handed over their buildings, at Tamale, to the Government,\r\nas it was shown that under the existing conditions and with but one\r\nEuropean representative to further its interests, cotton-growing\r\nin the Northern Territories could not hope to become a remunerative\r\nexport business (Colonial Reports, Northern Territories, G.C. 1916,\r\nNo. 956). The irregularity of the rainfall is a matter which must be\r\nborne in mind in any future attempts to develop the industry here,\r\nbut the possibilities of providing artificial irrigation should not\r\nbe overlooked, as large tracts of flat land exist near the White\r\nVolta river capable of becoming fertile under proper irrigation\r\nand drainage.\r\n\r\n=Other Field Crops.=—Yams are grown as a primary crop on mounds,\r\nand three different kinds are common, probably referable to\r\n_D. alata_, _D. sativa_, and _D. colocasiæfolia_, the last being\r\nwhat is termed the water yam and the first the winged yam. Guinea\r\ncorn is the most important food grain grown, but millet is sometimes\r\nplanted. A red species of sorghum (_S. guineensis_, var. _robustum_)\r\nis cultivated on a small scale for use in staining leather, but is\r\nnot used for food. Rice (_Oryza sativa_) is grown in the vicinity\r\nof the large rivers, but is said to suffer damage from elephants and\r\nhippopotami. The variety seems to be similar to the red rice grown in\r\nthe Gambia and Sierra Leone. Very little maize is planted, but some\r\nis grown near Salaga. Cassava is only seen in the south near the\r\nforest boundary, and groundnuts are not plentiful, owing, perhaps,\r\nto the fact that cooking oil is obtainable from shea butter trees,\r\nwhich are common in a wild state. Pigeon peas are often planted\r\nround the borders of fields, and are left to yield more than one\r\ncrop. This pea is identical with one of the common “Dhalls”\r\nof India (_Cajanus indicus_); the origin of the introduction is\r\nobscure. Small beans are grown as well as _Indigofera spp._ Sweet\r\npotatoes, okra, capsicum-peppers, sorrel-hibiscus (_H. Sabdariffa_),\r\nand the Fra-Fra potato (_Plectranthus, sp._, “Tumuku” of the\r\nHaussas) are also grown.\r\n\r\n=Fibre.=—Plants belonging to two species of _Hibiscus_ are\r\nused for the extraction of fibre for the preparation of cordage,\r\nthe cleaned fibre being similar to jute. These plants grow, with\r\nperfectly straight stems, to eight or ten feet in height, bearing\r\nshort thin branches with axillary flowers.\r\n\r\n=Tobacco.=—The tobacco grown is used for smoking or the manufacture\r\nof snuff in many parts of the Northern Territories, and is prepared\r\nin a special manner. For smoking tobacco the green leaves are pressed\r\ninto small gourds until a quantity of juice exudes, the mass being\r\nrolled in this until it assumes an oval form, in which it is sold\r\nin the markets before drying. For snuff it is ground up between\r\nheated stones until the requisite fineness has been obtained,\r\nand is then mixed with a small quantity of the powdered seeds of\r\n_Monodora myristica_. The tobacco fields are usually confined to\r\nsmall patches near houses, and wood ashes as well as sweepings\r\nare applied as a top dressing. This appears to be the only crop to\r\nwhich manure or fertiliser is given. The leaves always seem to be\r\nstripped off the stems at one operation, whereby old and immature\r\nleaves are mixed with mature.\r\n\r\n=GUMS.=—Two species of _Acacia_ (_A. arabica_ and _A. Sieberiana_)\r\nare found, especially in the uninhabited tracts in the centre of\r\nthe country, and the last named appears to yield a large flow of\r\ngum, which, however, is not collected. Examination of this at the\r\nImperial Institute has shown it to be about equal in quality to\r\ninferior Sudan grades; _A. arabica_ does not seem to yield gum with\r\nsuch frequency in this locality as elsewhere. _Burkea africana_\r\nand _Pseudocedrela Kotschyi_ produce a quality of gum comparable\r\nwith “Talh” from the Sudan. (Cf. _Selected Reports from the\r\nImperial Institute_, Pt. II., Gums and Resins, pp. 153, 165-7.)\r\n\r\n=WOOD OIL.=—By cutting deeply into the base of a tree known as\r\n“Neou” (Dagomba), and “Kawa” (Haussa), a rather copious flow\r\nof resinous liquid is induced, which, when solidified, is a resin\r\nsomewhat similar, but inferior, to copal. The tree from which this\r\nis procured is botanically known as _Daniellia thurifera_, Oliv.,\r\nand the so-called “oil” obtained was at one time shipped from\r\nNorthern Nigeria under the name of African Balsam of Copaiba. It\r\nis used in the Northern Territories for lighting purposes,\r\nas well as medicinally. The tree yields a handsomely grained\r\ntimber. (Cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1915.)\r\n\r\n=SHEA BUTTER.=—A tree known botanically as _Butyrospermum Parkii_\r\nbears a fruit, from the kernel of which this valuable vegetable\r\nfat is procured. The fat forms the cooking oil of the ultra-forest\r\ncountry, taking the place of palm oil in this respect. The mode of\r\npreparation in the Northern Territories is, doubtless, similar to\r\nthat employed in Northern Nigeria. The prepared butter is one of\r\nthe products carried by the Haussa traders, who visit Ashanti for\r\nthe purpose of purchasing kola, and is much appreciated in Kumassi,\r\nwhere it obtains a high price. A small quantity is carried down\r\nthe Volta river by the canoes which bring salt from Adda to Yeji\r\nand Daboya. An analysis made at the Imperial Institute of Shea\r\nbutter from the Northern Territories showed that the material is in\r\nno way inferior to the better-known “Shea butter” of Northern\r\nNigeria. Cf. _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. vi. (1908),\r\np. 370.\r\n\r\n=RUBBER.=—Recently some species of _Landolphia_ were found growing\r\nin the district of Wa and elsewhere, and, upon examination, one\r\nof these proved to be _L. owariensis_, P. Beauv. This was at first\r\nthought to occur plentifully, and to assume the underground habits of\r\n_L. Thollonii_, one of the most important sources of root or rhizome\r\nrubber in the Congo. Specimens, which were found growing near the\r\nsouth bank of the Black Volta river, in grass land, exhibited a\r\ntrailing form of growth owing to the absence of supporting trees,\r\nbut, although the plants were probably dwarfed by the annual grass\r\nfires, no development of root growth was observed in excess of that\r\nordinarily produced within the forests. The plant is now reported\r\nto occur rather rarely in the Northern Territories; another nearly\r\nallied, though useless, species having been mistaken for it.\r\n\r\n=DYES.=—For dyeing the yarn made from the native cotton, indigo\r\nis made from a species of _Indigofera_, or from the young leaves of\r\n_Lonchocarpus cyanescens_, but the process of preparation employed\r\nin this country has not been carefully observed. It is, however,\r\nprobably similar to that in common use in Sierra Leone, Northern\r\nNigeria, and the Gambia.\r\n\r\n=BEESWAX.=—Bees are attracted to hive in calabashes placed in\r\ntrees, the honey and wax being taken from them and sold in the\r\nmarkets. The bee belongs to a small variety of _Apis mellifera_,\r\nknown as var. _Adansonii_. A sample of beeswax obtained at Tamale\r\nwas examined at the Imperial Institute, and proved to be of excellent\r\nquality and worth £6 15_s_. per cwt. (Dec. 1908).\r\n\r\n=LEATHER.=—Tanning of sheep and goats’ skins is done to a small\r\nextent, the same process as that described for the preparation of\r\nKano leather in Northern Nigeria being followed. The _Acacia_ pods\r\nused for the purpose are obtained from trees often found planted\r\nin the middle of towns.\r\n\r\n=CATTLE AND POULTRY.=—A large breed of cattle with a dorsal hump\r\nexists in the Salaga district, and a straight-backed smaller kind\r\nthroughout the country to the north. Although “tsetse” flies\r\nof three species are common on the stream banks, the cattle seem\r\nto be healthy for the most part, and often form part of a caravan\r\ntravelling to the forest belt, where a good price is said to be\r\nobtained for them from the Ashantis. They are usually killed for\r\nfood very soon after entering the forest, where they can no longer\r\nbe kept free from the attacks of the three species of “tsetse”\r\n(_Glossina morsitans_, _G. palpalis_, and _G. pallidipes_), all of\r\nwhich seem to attack them. Horses are bred in some parts, but not\r\nto a large extent. Wire-haired sheep and goats are seen everywhere,\r\nand can be obtained in many places at a low price.\r\n\r\nFowls and Guinea-fowls are reared in several villages, and are\r\ncarried to the south for sale. Long open-work baskets are used,\r\nand the fowls are usually conveyed as head-loads. Guinea-fowls,\r\npurchasable for threepence each in some of the villages south\r\nof Daboya, are sold at four or five shillings each near the\r\ncoast. No coops seem to be employed in the villages to confine the\r\nguinea-fowls, which habitually roost upon the house-tops and which\r\nmay frequently be seen in the adjoining fields. They are scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from the wild birds which occur usually in the same\r\nlocalities. There is, however, a marked tendency on the part of the\r\ndomesticated examples to acquire white feathers upon the breast or\r\nwings to a greater or lesser extent.\r\n\r\nIt should be recorded that a considerable local trade is carried\r\non in the country in the sale of a flour-like substance obtained\r\nfrom the interior of the pods of _Parkia filicoidea_. This is made\r\nup with the seeds of the plant into an edible paste, locally termed\r\n“Dawadawa.”\r\n\r\n=EXPORTS.=—Excluding cocoa, which is treated separately in its\r\nplace, the following table shows the progress of the export trade\r\nbetween 1910 and 1919:—\r\n\r\n              KOLA.

Estabt., London._]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =NIGERIA-SOUTHERN PROVINCES=\r\n\r\n\r\n=INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.= =Administrative Divisions.=—On January\r\n1, 1914, the countries, hitherto administered separately under the\r\nnames of Northern and Southern Nigeria, were amalgamated and placed\r\nunder a Governor-General. It is, nevertheless, convenient, from\r\nthe point of view of their agricultural and commercial interests,\r\nto deal with them in this place separately. The inhabitants of the\r\nNorthern and Southern Provinces are to a very large extent dissimilar\r\nin languages, religion and customs, and the climatic conditions,\r\nby which distinct varieties of life are so much influenced, are so\r\nsuitably defined by the artificial boundary which, until recently,\r\ndivided Northern and Southern Nigeria, that little excuse need be\r\noffered for the maintenance of old division in the discussion of\r\nthe subjects within the competence of this book. Following then the\r\nplan adopted in the first edition, Southern Nigeria, referred to now\r\nas the Southern Provinces, is being first dealt with and treated,\r\nas far as possible, independently of Northern Nigeria, now entitled\r\nthe Northern Provinces, the separate account of which follows.\r\n\r\n=Geographical Position.=—Pending the adjustment of the eastern\r\nfrontier, occasioned by the outcome of the recent war, the Southern\r\nProvinces of Nigeria extend from 2° 45′ E. to 10° 15′ E. long.:\r\nthe Western Province reaching 9° 10′ N., and the Central and\r\nEastern about 7° 15′ N. lat.\r\n\r\n=Area and Population.=—The estimated area of the country before\r\nadjustment was 94,000 sq. miles, and the census of 1911 showed the\r\npopulation as 7,857,983.\r\n\r\n=Natural Divisions.=—The Southern Provinces are conveniently\r\ndivided for agricultural considerations into _wet_ and _dry_\r\nzones. In the former the rainfall ranges from about 90 inches\r\nat Bendi to 250 inches at Opobo. In the latter zone the highest\r\nrainfall is reached in Lagos Town, where about 75 inches are\r\nannually registered; the lowest reading being that of 40 inches\r\nat Olokemeji. The densely forested area is practically entirely\r\nwithin the wet zone; this also including a tract of brackish-water\r\nforest (mangrove) and swamp. In the dry zone grass-land and open\r\n“bush,” with trees peculiar to such localities, occur, and it\r\nis in this portion of the country that most of the agricultural\r\npeople are found. The inhabitants of the forested area in the wet\r\nzone give more attention to the collection of forest products,\r\nsuch as palm oil and rubber, and only grow sufficient grain and\r\nroots for their own consumption.\r\n\r\n=Inhabitants.=—The tribes found in the Western Province are chiefly\r\nYorubas, and among these are some of the most intelligent people\r\nin the country. In the Central Province there are a large number of\r\ntribes speaking different languages, but among these the Benis are\r\nperhaps of most importance. The Ijoas, Ibos, Aros, and many other\r\ntribes inhabit the Eastern Province, and are generally of a lower\r\ngrade of civilisation than the others mentioned. The country between\r\nthe northern part of the Cross river and the Niger is populated by\r\nother pagan tribes, who seem to be careful cultivators, but very\r\nlittle is known of them at present.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=—The Yoruba race are industrious cultivators, and\r\nshow considerably more ambition than most of the other West African\r\npeoples. The country in which they live is particularly adapted to\r\nfarming, and the climatic conditions are suitable for the cultivation\r\nof cotton and fibrous plants, in addition to the various grain\r\ncrops. In some parts cocoa, rubber, and kola are being cultivated,\r\nbut these are not so suitable under the prevailing conditions as\r\nthey would be within the wet zone—the Western Province, which\r\nthese people inhabit, being entirely within the dry region.\r\n\r\nAlthough farming is so extensive, continuous cultivation is not\r\nfound, and the use of manure is practically unknown. The usual\r\npractice is to farm a piece of land for a few years, and to permit\r\nit then to return to a wild state for a long period. In their want\r\nof knowledge concerning the value of manure and the application of\r\nartificial irrigation, the Yoruba farmers are behind the Haussas\r\nof Northern Nigeria, but are more careful than the Nupes of the\r\nsame country. The depth of the Yoruba cultivation is greater than\r\nthat of the northern Haussa, and this in some measure compensates\r\nfor the non-employment of manure, etc.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Central Province are generally less careful in\r\ntheir farming methods; the Benis often planting their grain crops\r\nin only partially cleared land. Farther to the north in the same\r\nprovince a better system is noticeable among the Ishans, Ifons, and\r\nthe people of Agbede. During recent years, owing to the energetic\r\nefforts of the Forestry Department, the cultivation and better\r\ntreatment of the indigenous rubber tree (_Funtumia elastica_)\r\nhave been extensively adopted, especially by the people in the\r\nneighbourhood of Benin City, where the climate is well suited to\r\nthe species. In addition to rubber, cocoa and kola plantations\r\nmight prove successful in the same localities, but as yet no large\r\nplantations of either exist.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Province farming is generally of poor quality until\r\nthe region of heavy rainfall is left, when extremely large areas\r\nare met with, highly cultivated, with the earth thrown up into\r\nloose mounds, often five or six feet in height, for the purpose of\r\ngrowing yams, maize, pepper, okra, Guinea corn, pumpkins, etc.,\r\nall of which are found planted upon each mound; the yams being\r\ncarefully trained to climb along fibre strings towards central poles.\r\n\r\n=Principal Crops.=—The chief crops grown in the Western Province\r\nare maize, cotton, cassava, yams, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, and\r\nto a small extent Guinea corn, sugar-cane, tobacco, Colocasia yams,\r\npeppers, okra, rice, eggplant, and native beans.\r\n\r\nIndigo is extracted from _Lonchocarpus cyanescens_, which occurs\r\nin a wild state, and is preserved when making clearances for\r\nfarms. The _Indigofera spp._ are used to a smaller degree for the\r\nsame purpose. (See Sierra Leone Section, p. 39; also _Bulletin of\r\nthe Imperial Institute_, 1909, p. 319; 1918, p. 11; and 1919, p. 31.)\r\n\r\nFruits are not grown plentifully, and are generally left in an\r\nuncultivated condition. The chief kinds are pineapples, bananas,\r\npawpaws, akee apple (_Blighia sapida_), oranges, and guavas. There\r\nare several fruits and spices which are collected from the forest\r\nstrips, but, taken generally, the Western Province people are\r\nnot great fruit eaters. On the sea coast and for a considerable\r\ndistance inland, coconut plantations are common, and, near Badagry,\r\ncopra is prepared from them for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe crops cultivated in the Central Province are similar to\r\nthose of the Western, but yams become more, and groundnuts less\r\nprominent. Large quantities of palm oil are prepared, and rubber is\r\ncollected, the labour available for farm work being thereby reduced.\r\n\r\nThe most important product of the Eastern Province is undoubtedly\r\npalm oil, but fairly large quantities of yams and maize are grown\r\noutside the forest zone and are transported by native canoes to\r\nthe coast ports, in the vicinity of which there is very little\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the oil palm, which is of general\r\noccurrence throughout the country, the Lagos silk rubber tree\r\n(_Funtumia elastica_) is of the most importance from a commercial\r\nstandpoint. Rubber vines of the genera _Landolphia_ and _Carpodinus_\r\nare also valuable wild plants, from which some of the finest\r\nrubbers are at present extracted. Copal, known as “Ogea” gum,\r\nand collected from a tree which has been determined as _Cyanothyrsus\r\noblongus_ (syn. _ogea_), is exported in varying quantity according\r\nto the market value. A fairly extensive local trade is done in\r\n“chew-sticks” in the Western Province; the sticks being cut\r\nfrom a tree which occurs in the grass country, and is recognised\r\nas _Anogeissus leiocarpus_. The ash made from the wood of the same\r\ntree is sold for use as a mordant in indigo dyeing. Camwood is\r\na red dye-wood prepared from at least three different species of\r\ntrees—_Baphia nitida_, _Pterocarpus tinctorius_, and _Pterocarpus\r\nsp._—and is almost entirely used locally for staining the human\r\nskin or dyeing leather. Fibre plants do not appear to be cultivated\r\nin any part of the country, but occur to some extent in all the\r\nforested parts. _Hibiscus guineensis_ and _Dombeya buettneri_\r\nare usually employed for native ropes, and the bark of _Sterculia\r\nbarteri_ is said to be prepared for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n=OIL PALM.=—A description of this tree and information in\r\nconnection with the principal characteristics and mode of propagation\r\nhave been given in the Sierra Leone portion of this work, and it\r\nmay merely be remarked that there is no difference in a general\r\nway between trees grown in the two localities. With regard to the\r\nform of fruit, however, that of Southern Nigeria is separated into\r\nseveral kinds, varying in the relative proportion of pericarp and\r\nkernel, and these will be referred to later.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing palm oil varies to a large degree in the\r\ndifferent localities. The best quality of oil is that produced in\r\nthe Western Province. The oil, which on the market is classed as\r\n“Lagos fine grade,” and obtains the highest price among West\r\nAfrican oils, is made from the fresh fruits boiled and pounded in\r\nthe manner described for the Sierra Leone oil, but the extracted\r\noil is further cleared by straining and boiling until a uniformly\r\nclear and limpid product is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRAINING OIL FROM THE FIBROUS PULP OF THE OIL PALM,\r\nOSHOGBO.\r\n\r\nFig. 22, p. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COTTON BALES, MARLBOROUGH GINNERY, IBADAN.\r\n\r\nFig. 23, p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFARA TREE (_TERMINALIA SUPERBA_) AT OLOKOMEJI.\r\n\r\nFig. 24, p. 118.]\r\n\r\nAn inferior quality is that made at Oshogbo and north of Ibadan\r\ngenerally. The fruits, after having been boiled for about three\r\nhours, have the fibrous pulp sufficiently loosened, so that the\r\nwhole is easily separated from the nuts by pounding in a wooden\r\nmortar. The fibrous mass thus obtained is then put into a pit, which\r\nis filled to a depth of about eighteen inches with cold water, and\r\nthe oil is expressed by women and young girls, who tread it out with\r\ntheir feet. After leaving the water undisturbed for a short time,\r\nthe oil rises to the surface, from which it is skimmed, or it may be\r\nprecipitated, by the removal of a plug placed in the side of the pit,\r\ninto a vessel placed to receive it. The treading process is repeated\r\nuntil most of the oil is extracted. The oil is then separated from\r\nthe water which it contains by boiling. The fibrous pulp is next\r\nremoved, strained in baskets, and is placed upon rocks to dry in\r\nthe sun, after which it is pressed into large balls, which are sold\r\nin the local markets at 1_d_. each. Much of this finds its way to\r\nLagos Town, where it is sold for fuel at the rate of 8_d_. for 8½\r\nlb. In this connection it may be mentioned that there appears to be\r\nno foundation for the statement which has been made to the effect\r\nthat this residual pulp is exported in large quantities from Lagos\r\nfor the further extraction of oil by chemical means in Europe. An\r\nillustration is given showing a girl straining fibrous pulp in an\r\noil pit at Oshogbo (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\nIn the Central and Eastern Provinces “hard” oil is the\r\ncommercial name applied to the kind which is generally made. At\r\nOnitsha the natives may be seen bringing in this oil, which is of\r\nsuch a consistency that even at an atmospheric temperature of 90° it\r\nremains in a solid wax-like condition. The earthen vessels in which\r\nsuch oil is conveyed to the factories, when accidentally dropped\r\nand broken, do not necessarily occasion the loss of any oil. The\r\nthickened condition is entirely due to the method of preparation,\r\nduring which important chemical changes occur, which appear to\r\nbe detrimental to the oil for some of its most important uses,\r\nespecially that of soap manufacture, while rendering it suitable\r\nfor employment for making candles. The important difference in the\r\npreparation of this oil lies in the fact that instead of the fresh\r\nfruits being used, the pericarp is separated from the nuts by means\r\nof partial decomposition, induced by burying the fruits in the\r\nground for a period varying from three weeks to two months. The\r\nsemi-decomposed pericarp is then easily removed by pounding or\r\ntreading out in a canoe-shaped receptacle, after which the fibrous\r\nmass is boiled, and the liquid oil is skimmed and allowed to set\r\nin earthen jars, in which it is carried for sale to the factories.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of kernels from the nuts is one of the usual\r\noccupations of the women and children of a village, when not\r\nassisting in the preparation of oil. The nuts are spread in the sun\r\nfor about a week or more until a shrinkage of the kernel occurs,\r\nwhich renders the nut-shell capable of being easily cracked without\r\ndamage to the interior. It is said that in the Jebu district, to\r\nthe north-east of Lagos, the local price paid for kernels ranges\r\nfrom 4_d_. to 4½_d_. for a filled tin bowl having the diameter of\r\nnine inches.\r\n\r\nThe primitive method of extracting kernels, by means of cracking\r\nthe nut-shell between stones and picking out the contents, has not\r\nyet given way to the employment of the various machines which have\r\nbeen introduced from time to time to supersede it.\r\n\r\nA black oil is extracted at Oshogbo by roasting the kernels in an\r\nearthen pot until black, and stirring meanwhile until the whole mass\r\nbecomes covered with exuded oil. A small quantity of cold water\r\nis then sprinkled into the pot after removing it from the fire,\r\nand the contents are pounded in a mortar until an oily meal is\r\nproduced. This is boiled, and, when the mixture is cool, the oil\r\nis skimmed from the surface of the water which has been added for\r\nthe boiling. This oil is apparently only used locally.\r\n\r\nThe existing native social system, under which the male head of\r\na family receives almost exclusive consideration, is opposed to\r\nnative co-operation in any mechanical process, whereby a relief from\r\nlabour of his numerous dependants—wives, children, and aged or\r\ninfirm relatives—would be incurred at the expense of his enhanced\r\npersonal labour; he being the carrier and disposer of the produce at\r\nthe market. By the conveyance and sale of nuts instead of kernels,\r\na much smaller return in value would be obtained for the same\r\nweight of material, _i.e._ a similar amount of personal energy. The\r\ndependants, incapable of assisting in transporting, would remain\r\nidle, unless some similar work could be found for them. Up to a\r\nshort distance from the delivery point (which would determine itself)\r\nthe nuts instead of the kernels would be brought in for sale, and,\r\nlimited by the capabilities of the available palm-tree climbers,\r\nthe family dependants would be able to prepare larger quantities\r\nof pericarp oil; but the increased accumulation of kernels would\r\nfurther decrease the radius from the selling centre at which the\r\ncarriers would be able to work.\r\n\r\nIf the entire fruit were to be bought up for mechanical extraction of\r\npericarp oil as well as kernels, the carrying labour would be still\r\nfurther enhanced, and the work of the oil-manufacturing communities\r\nwould resolve itself into three operations—viz. climbing trees,\r\nchopping out fruit, and transporting—which would mean the exclusion\r\nfrom work of all but the strong adults, or the reduction of workers\r\nby 30 to 50 per cent. perhaps. The number of skilled palm-tree\r\nclimbers is said to be decreasing in many districts, and, owing\r\nto the sparsity of the population in some localities, a very large\r\nproportion of the annual yield of fruit remains unharvested.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the several varieties of the oil palm of the\r\ncountry is in progress at the Imperial Institute, and the characters\r\nof the most important are now well known, and may be compared here\r\nwith the varieties from the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and\r\nNorthern Nigeria. The typical form, which, although subject to some\r\nvariation, possesses certain marked characteristics, may be said\r\nto fall under the following general description:\r\n\r\nFruiting heads generally large. Fruit large, orange to scarlet\r\nin colour, with a variable amount of purplish black suffusion\r\nat the apex, which may extend over more than half of the fruit\r\nor may be altogether absent. Pericarp thin, kernel large with a\r\nthick shell. Names: “Ope yope” or “Ope pankora” (Yoruba),\r\n“Ok-poruk-pu” (Ibo), “Udin” (Beni), “Ak-porro-jub”\r\n(Efik), “Irök-Eyop” (Ibibio), “Abe pa” and perhaps “Abe\r\ndam” (Fanti, Gold Coast), “Tug bore” (Mendi, Sierra Leone),\r\n“Tabel-tiloli” (Timani, Sierra Leone), “Tengo” (Mandingo,\r\nGambia), “Kabe-kalako” (Jolah, Gambia), “Neul” (Joloff,\r\nGambia), “Qua-qua” (Haussa, N. Nigeria), “Yi-ku-niche”\r\n(Nupe, N. Nigeria). Only the typical form has as yet been observed\r\nin Sierra Leone, Gambia, and Northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nThe other particularly important variety is that commonly referred\r\nto as the “_soft-shelled_” or “_thin-shelled_” palm fruit,\r\nwhich has been recorded from many localities in West Africa. The\r\nfollowing description will include the forms contained in this group:\r\n\r\nFruiting heads often large. Fruits large or small, generally the\r\nlatter, dark coloured. Pericarp thick, kernel rather small, with a\r\nthin shell. Names: “Ope-Arunfo” (Yoruba), “Au-su-ku” (Ibo),\r\n“Ivioronmila” (Beni), “Asoge-e-jub” (Efik), “Eduege Eyop”\r\n(Ibibio), “Abe-bobe” (Fanti, Gold Coast).\r\n\r\nThe third kind is that frequently called the “_Fetish_”\r\nor “_King_” palm nut. It is rare wherever it occurs, and is\r\nscarcely worth consideration from an economic standpoint. The tree\r\nwhich bears this fruit has been described under the distinct specific\r\nname of _Elæis Thompsoni_, Chevalier.\r\n\r\nFruiting heads generally small. Fruits medium-sized, red with\r\nblack markings occasionally present. Pericarp moderately thick,\r\nkernel and shell medium. The nuts, which possess four eyes, are\r\nnot used in the manufacture of commercial oil, but are employed in\r\nconnection with the worship of the deity Ifa (Dennett). Names:\r\n“Ope Ifa” (Yoruba), “Ojuku” (Ibo), “Oged-udin”\r\n(Beni), “Affia-ko-jub” (Efik), “Efiako-Eyop” (Ibibio),\r\n“Abe-ohene” (Fanti, Gold Coast).\r\n\r\nThe above are the three most marked forms of oil palm recognisable,\r\nalthough other varieties are given special names by natives in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, distinctions being frequently made\r\nbetween the fruit from trees which assume a tall growth and those\r\nwhich remain stunted. (Cf. also _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1909, p. 362;\r\nand 1920, p. 223.)\r\n\r\nAs far as investigations have progressed, the advantage with\r\nregard to yield of oil as well as quality is maintained by the\r\nthin-shelled variety, the greater proportion of pericarp enabling\r\na larger amount of pericarp oil to be expressed, while the thin\r\nkernel-covering facilitates the extraction of the kernel. Before\r\nbeing able to definitely state that this variety is of the greatest\r\neconomic value, it is necessary that a comparison of the weight of\r\nthe annual crops from all varieties should be made.\r\n\r\nThe advisability of planting any particular variety of oil palm would\r\nin the first place depend on the results obtained from the complete\r\ninvestigation of all; but at the present time such a project on a\r\nlarge scale is not likely to be practicable, as it is generally\r\nacknowledged that only a comparatively small proportion of the\r\nexisting wild trees are at present utilised.\r\n\r\nExperiments in the Kamerun, with different varieties of oil palms,\r\nseemed to indicate that the thin-shelled character was not a fixed\r\none. In 1910 a forest officer in Nigeria was detailed to study the\r\ndistribution, cultivation and preparation of the oil, of the most\r\nappreciated varieties, and a quantity of nuts of the soft-shelled\r\n“Lisombe” kind from the Kamerun were distributed for planting\r\namong the natives of the Eastern Province.\r\n\r\nThe export figures of this trade from 1910 to 1918 are tabulated\r\nbelow. Up to the year 1914, those of Northern were separated from\r\nthose of Southern Nigeria. In this account, subsequent to that year,\r\nthe two sets of figures have been taken together. A quantity of\r\nkernels is imported from Dahomey for re-export, amounting in 1910\r\nto 21,120 tons. The figures indicate that the increase has been\r\nirregular, and, during the last few years, has been influenced\r\nby the war. In 1919 here, as in the other W. African Colonies,\r\na differential export tax of £2 per ton was imposed, with respect\r\nto palm kernels.\r\n\r\n  Year   Palm oil in tons   Palm kernels in tons\r\n       (280 galls. = 1 ton)\r\n  1910       76,850             172,998\r\n  1911       79,337             176,390\r\n  1912       76,994             184,624\r\n  1913       83,088             174,718\r\n  1914       72,531             162,452\r\n  1915       72,994             153,319\r\n  1916       67,422             161,439\r\n  1917       74,619             185,998\r\n  1918       86,425             205,167\r\n  1919      100,967             216,913\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the amount of oil produced in\r\nproportion to kernels collected, there being a marked difference\r\nin this respect between the output of the Western Province (Lagos)\r\nand the Central and Eastern Provinces. A previous series of thirteen\r\nyears’ exports from the former showed an average of 60·9 gallons\r\nof oil to the ton of kernels; while for the latter a twelve-year\r\nperiod at the same time gave 219·6 gallons of oil to the ton of\r\nkernels. The mean for the whole was 140·25 gallons at that time,\r\nbut during the last seven years it has fallen to 125·7 gallons. In\r\n1912 the first shipments of kernel oil and cake were made from\r\nfactories established under European control at Opobo and Lagos,\r\nthe amounts exported being 500 tons of oil and 635 tons of cake. In\r\nthe following year the value of both products turned out by these\r\nfactories is given as £161,000, and in 1914 as £72,000, when,\r\nwithout any assigned reason, both factories were closed down.\r\n\r\nArticles on the African palm-oil industry in the Southern Provinces\r\nof Nigeria will be found in _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\n1909, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1919.\r\n\r\nAn interesting article appears in the _Bulletin of the Imperial\r\nInstitute_, vol. xviii., No. 2 (1920), entitled “The Cultivation\r\nof the African Oil Palm, with special reference to the East\r\nIndies.” From this it appears that the tree thrives and yields very\r\nsatisfactorily, especially in Sumatra; the oil content of the fruit\r\nand kernels being both high. Attention is drawn in this article to\r\nthe extension of the use of palm oil in Europe as an edible fat,\r\nin addition to its present uses.\r\n\r\n=Other Oil Seeds.=—Excluding the shea nut tree, which will be\r\nreferred to later on, three trees have been considered of sufficient\r\nimportance for their seeds to be shipped to Europe in order that\r\ntheir value may be determined. These are _Pentaclethra macrophylla_\r\n(Cutlass bean), _Irvingia Barteri_ (African mango), and _Lophira\r\nalata_. Although the trials proved that the oils of all might be\r\nvaluable for the manufacture of soap and candles, none of the trees\r\noccur in sufficient profusion to permit a large export trade in the\r\nseeds being established. (See _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. v. [1907], pp. 10-14, and vol. vi. [1908], pp. 243, 354-80.)\r\n\r\n=RUBBER.=—Following the progress made by the Forestry Department\r\nin re-establishing the indigenous rubber tree (_Funtumia elastica_)\r\nin places from which it had almost disappeared, an excellent system\r\nof communal plantations was established. This system, which has\r\nbeen largely adopted by the chiefs, is one to encourage the village\r\ninhabitants to re-establish rubber trees in their proximity; the\r\nplanting and tapping and preparation of the rubber being under\r\nthe direction of the Government officers. The resulting rubber is\r\nmarketed by the Government, who retain one-third of the sale price\r\nto cover the cost of supervision, etc.; the remaining two-thirds\r\nbeing paid to the village community. In this manner a large number of\r\ncommunal plantations have now been established. In 1911 over 400 new\r\nplantations of this kind were made; about 100,000 Funtumia plants\r\nbeing put in. At the same time 129,000 Para rubber seeds and some\r\n4,000 seedlings were distributed under the same scheme, while Ceara\r\nplantations were made in the drier parts of the country. Licences\r\nto collect wild rubber were simultaneously made compulsory.\r\n\r\nThe rubber produced on the Government plantation at Mamu Forest,\r\nby the boiling method, proved very satisfactory. In 1910 such rubber\r\nwas sold at 6_s_. 6_d_. per lb., being only 6_d_. less than the best\r\nPara fetched at the same time. Three hundred communal plantations\r\nyielded rubber in 1911 against eighty-four in the previous year,\r\nthe average yield per tree being 1·59 oz. against 1·406 oz. In\r\n1912 communal rubber amounted to 3,031 lbs., which sold at about\r\n3_s_. 4_d_. per lb.; and in the same year Government plantation\r\nrubber was 3,501 lbs., which realised 3_s_. 10_d_. per lb.\r\n\r\nThe next rubber plant of importance is the vine, _Landolphia\r\nowariensis_, which is somewhat variable in the form of growth. The\r\nlatex at certain seasons coagulates almost instantaneously, but at\r\nother times it runs freely, and can be collected for coagulation by\r\nheat, the admixture of acid, alkali or alcohol, or by spontaneous\r\nexposure. The scrap rubber, which is collected from that coagulated\r\nupon the stem, is made into balls, and comes into the market under\r\nthe name of “first Niggers,” and commands a high price.\r\n\r\nThe native has discovered that a larger amount of rubber can be\r\nobtained at one time if the roots and stems are cut and pounded\r\nup. The result is a product known as “root rubber,” the\r\ncollection of which can be justified only where the plant, from\r\nwhich it is obtained, develops an extensive rhizome or subterranean\r\ngrowth, capable of being partially removed without killing the\r\nplant. Such vines, although found in some other parts of Africa,\r\ndo not occur in Southern Nigeria, and the collection of so-called\r\n“root rubber” from _L. owariensis_ only leads to the complete\r\ndestruction of the plant, and should be discouraged. The small\r\nyield of latex from this species after many years of growth, and\r\nthe difficulties in connection with the collection of the rubber,\r\nrender its cultivation in plantations unprofitable, although planting\r\nhas been attempted in the French and German Colonies.\r\n\r\n_Clitandra elastica_ is another vine said to yield a copious supply\r\nof latex, capable of being coagulated by means of heating after\r\ndilution with water. In appearance the vine is somewhat similar\r\nto _L. owariensis_, but does not appear to be common. The rubber\r\nproduced from this species is reported to be of excellent quality.\r\n\r\n_Carpodinus hirsutus_, a common vine in the dry zone and on the\r\nNiger river banks, furnishes a plentiful supply of latex of inferior\r\nquality, and is made into “root” and “paste” rubber by\r\nboiling; the latter being a sticky product of the consistency of\r\nbirdlime, and only saleable in Europe at a low price.\r\n\r\nThe latices of _Landolphia Thompsonii_ and _L. senegalensis_ are\r\nused similarly. Both species are nearly allied to _L. florida_,\r\nwhich is prepared elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA number of latex-yielding plants are employed in the adulteration\r\nof good rubber, among which the following may be mentioned as\r\nthe commonest: _Funtumia africana_, _Conopharyngia sp._, _Alstonia\r\ncongoensis_, and _Holarrhena Wulfsburgii_. The admixture of these is\r\nusually detected by the stickiness which they impart to good rubber.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of licences for permission to collect wild rubber\r\nand that of the communal plantation system, previously referred\r\nto, have rendered the position more secure than previously, and\r\ninsured the preservation of the wild plants which were threatened\r\nwith extinction. This has moreover been effected in the most\r\neconomical manner.\r\n\r\nThe results of the tappings on the Para rubber plantations in\r\ndifferent parts of the country are of interest. In 1911 at Ebute\r\nMetta, trees eighteen years old yielded 3 lbs. 5½ oz. per tree;\r\nat Calabar six year old trees gave an average of 6 oz. per tree;\r\nwhile at Sapele in the same year, five year old trees yielded\r\nfrom 14 oz. to 1 lb. 6½ oz. per tree. In the following year the\r\nsame trees at Ebute Metta gave 7 lbs. 4¾ oz., while those at\r\nSapele yielded from 1 lb. 4¾ oz. to 1 lb. 11¾ oz. In 1915 from\r\ntwo Para rubber estates at Sapele 94,413 lbs. of dry rubber was\r\nharvested. (Cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1910, 1912, 1913, 1918.)\r\n\r\n=Export of Rubber.=—The Commercial Intelligence Officer of Southern\r\nNigeria, in his report on the trade of the country for 1907, gives a\r\ntable showing the rubber exported from Southern Nigerian ports from\r\n1900 to 1907; but as these figures include large quantities of the\r\nproduct from Northern Nigeria, shipped through Southern Nigerian\r\nports, they do not represent the output from the latter country\r\nalone. Until 1907 apparently no record of the Northern Nigerian\r\nrubber exported was kept, but in the year mentioned 1,187,588 lbs.,\r\nvalued at £91,074, were recorded as having passed the customs post\r\nof Northern Nigeria at Ida, on the Niger. The amounts, in tons,\r\nexported from the Southern Provinces alone were: 1907, 690; 1908,\r\n545; 1909, 620; and from the whole of Nigeria from that time: 1910,\r\n1,180; 1911, 966; 1912, 705; 1913, 510; 1914, no figures; 1915, 248;\r\n1916, 396; 1917, 392; 1918, 157; 1919, 398. The rubber production\r\nof the country is to some extent controlled by the market price,\r\nwhich is at present very low (1921).\r\n\r\n=COPAL.=—Some quantity of a kind of copal resin is collected from\r\n_Cyanothyrsus oblongus_ (syn. _C. ogea_), and is exported under the\r\nname of “Ogea gum.” The quality appears to be similar to that\r\nobtained from the Gold Coast _Cyanothyrsus sp._, and which is sold\r\nunder the name of “Accra copal.” Both are obtained in a fresh and\r\na fossil state. Owing to the recent fall in the price of ogea gum,\r\nthe collection of it has diminished, but there are said to be large\r\nquantities available which would be collected as soon as a better\r\ndemand occurred. (See articles on “Copal Resins from British West\r\nAfrica,” _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1908, p. 245; and 1914, p. 218.)\r\n\r\n=COCOA.=—The good fortune which has recently attended the planters\r\nin West Africa, owing to a sudden demand for their cocoa, has\r\nencouraged them, especially to the north and north-east of Lagos,\r\nto make more extensive plantations. The climatic conditions in the\r\nWestern Province, however, are not favourable, and the repeated\r\nfailures of trees, due to the exhausting effect of the long dry\r\nseasons, give the plantations an irregular appearance. The trees in\r\nthe plantations made at Agege, where many well-to-do planters have\r\nmade farms, are stunted, and planted in too close proximity, mostly\r\nwithout permanent shade trees. In some instances the trees showed\r\ndisease from the sapping of the bark juices occasioned by a Capsid,\r\nthe species of which is as yet undetermined. The chief cause of their\r\nsterility and death seems, however, to be the unfavourable climatic\r\nconditions. In the direction of the Abeokuta-Ibadan boundary, better\r\nplanting seems to have been done and permanent shade trees preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Agege planters are dissatisfied with the\r\nprices they obtain for their cocoa, which they maintain is properly\r\nfermented and of better quality than that of their neighbours. An\r\nassociation of the local planters was recently formed to ship\r\ntheir own produce direct to the European markets. The Agege cocoa\r\ngenerally, however, does not appear to be more carefully prepared\r\nor of better quality than the other local kinds. Fermentation\r\nis certainly practised in many places, and is becoming popular\r\nthroughout the Western Province, owing to the discovery that the\r\nfermented pulp juice forms a beverage, which is said to be used as\r\na substitute for palm wine, but the beans are frequently improperly\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Province the climatic conditions appear to be more\r\nfavourable for the plant, and there are now a number of small\r\nplantations near Eket, Old Calabar, and Itu. The product is still\r\nimproperly prepared and usually unfermented, but time and experience\r\nwill remedy this.\r\n\r\nIn the Central Province from 1915 some activity in cocoa planting\r\nhas occurred in the Benin district, but attention there is still\r\nmainly devoted to rubber planting.\r\n\r\nSee also _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1914, p. 213; 1915, p. 553; and 1919,\r\np. 289.\r\n\r\nThe exports of cocoa have been as follows:\r\n\r\n  Year  Lagos (W. Province)    S. Nigeria (C. & E.

The\r\ncondition of the industry, especially in the Western Province,\r\nis extremely favourable, and shows signs of further development.\r\n\r\nIn every Yoruba market sales of cotton are now conducted as a part\r\nof the regular transactions of the day, and cotton from distant\r\nvillages filters through from market to market, increasing in\r\nvalue as it approaches a ginnery, where the full price for it may\r\nbe ultimately claimed by the trader who has collected it.\r\n\r\nOn account of this system of passing from one market to another,\r\nchiefly in the form of barter for other produce, it becomes nearly\r\nimpossible to accurately determine the origin of the supplies\r\nbrought to the ginneries; and, by reference to the records kept,\r\nvery large quantities of cotton often appear as having been sent\r\nfrom towns which are little more than accumulating centres, and in\r\nthe vicinity of which there is little or no cotton grown.\r\n\r\nExperience in the plantation of cotton under European control has\r\nshown that without combining the work of a general trader, farmer,\r\nand ginner with that of grower, such an attempt is not likely to\r\nprove remunerative. The British Cotton Growing Association have\r\nabandoned development upon these lines, directing their attention\r\nsolely towards buying, ginning and inducing the native farmers\r\nto cultivate the plant in their ordinary field rotations. Such\r\nplantations as still exist are now under the direct control of the\r\nGovernment and are maintained for the purpose of experimental work\r\nand for the propagation of improved types.\r\n\r\nThe local varieties of cotton may be roughly classed under five\r\nheads, which are easily recognisable by the characters of the seed\r\nand lint. These are:\r\n\r\n1. Black, clean-seeded with a brown tuft or brown woolly and a\r\nbrick-red lint.—“Eponkon.”\r\n\r\n2. Black, clean-seeded, with a creamy white lint.—Common Western\r\nProvince kind; rarer in the Central Province (Ishan).\r\n\r\n3. Black, adhering seeds, “kidney” kind, lint creamy.—Common\r\nCentral Province.\r\n\r\n4. White or brownish woolly seeded, lint creamy.—Meko and Agbede\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\n5. Green woolly seeded, lint creamy.—Rather uncommon except\r\nat Agege.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the above classes do not appear to be sufficiently\r\nconstant to render it easy to give each class a specific position,\r\nalthough some of them are doubtless separable. All native forms of\r\nplant are constantly of greater stature than American, and in this\r\nparticular resemble Egyptian kinds.\r\n\r\nThe red-linted form known as “Eponkon” is identical with the\r\n“Dhoole” of Sierra Leone, and, although prolific, yields a cotton\r\nwhich is of little value for export. The other four kinds are those\r\nfrom which the Southern Nigerian output of exported cotton is almost\r\nwholly obtained, and the price realised varies from ½_d_. under\r\nto 1_d_. or more over Middling American. The finest cottons are\r\nthose grown at Agege and Meko; the former being supposed to be a\r\nhybrid with an American variety, and the latter a constant local\r\nvariety. Some of the shipments, from Illushi, of cotton grown near\r\nAgbede appear to have been of equally desirable quality.\r\n\r\nA large number of specimens of cotton have been examined at the\r\nImperial Institute, and the length of fibre is generally found to\r\nbe over one inch in average, but the colour is yellowish, and there\r\nis less lustre than is found in the American kinds. Although the\r\nprice obtained is often somewhat higher than that of the standard\r\nMiddling American grade, Manchester spinners do not regard West\r\nAfrican cotton as quite suitable for their ordinary requirements,\r\nand it appears that the higher prices have only been paid for small\r\nquantities which were capable of being used for special purposes.\r\n\r\nFor the reason mentioned, efforts have been made to replace\r\nthe indigenous cottons by American kinds, or to hybridise the\r\ntwo, but the results have not yet been successful, the tendency\r\nbeing to produce an irregular mixed lint, which is commercially\r\ninferior. American and Egyptian cottons seem to be less capable\r\nof withstanding the attacks of the local insect pests, and a\r\nlarge proportion of the seed is rendered sterile by the cotton\r\nseed bug. Grown experimentally on a small scale at Olokemeji,\r\nthe following results were obtained from several exotic and local\r\ncottons (American Middling at 6·64_d_. per lb.):—\r\n\r\n                               Yield          Staple\r\n      Variety                 per A.

These cottons are\r\nreferred to in Professor Dunstan’s Report (1907), “British\r\nCotton Cultivation.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the susceptibility of the American varieties to the\r\nattacks of the local insect pests, the seed produced from plants\r\ngrown in the country is often sterile. In the districts in the\r\nvicinity of the British Cotton Growing Association’s ginneries\r\nAmerican and native cottons are often seen growing in the same field,\r\nbut as the time of reaching maturity differs in the various forms,\r\nand the cotton is not easily kept separate in the native methods\r\nof harvesting, a mixed crop is obtained. Experimenting at the\r\nMoor Plantation at Ibadan, the British Cotton Growing Association\r\nhave obtained occasionally satisfactory results from the American\r\nplots, as appeared to be the case in the 1908-9 season, when an\r\nAmerican “Upland” variety is said to have yielded 800 lbs. of\r\nseed cotton per acre. In the previous year an indigenous variety\r\ncalled “Meko” is recorded as having produced over 900 lbs. to\r\nthe acre. These results are largely dependent upon the season and\r\nthe time of sowing.\r\n\r\nArtificial pollination of the female flowers of the local forms\r\nwith pollen taken from American kinds has not yet succeeded in\r\nproducing a permanent hybrid, although the result in the first\r\ngeneration has frequently shown great promise. There is no doubt\r\nthat the establishment of a hybrid which would carry the lint of\r\nthe best American kind and retain the hardiness and blight-resisting\r\npowers of the indigenous forms would be very desirable, but such a\r\ntype could only be evolved after careful experiment and selection\r\nfor a prolonged period. Such work may probably be undertaken\r\nby the Agricultural Department in the future. Until this can be\r\nscientifically taken up, the improvement of the existing forms by a\r\nmore gradual means should be attempted, namely by a careful selection\r\nof seed and elimination of undesirable forms of plants in the field.\r\n\r\nWhere cotton is planted by natives, the cultivation is usually\r\ncarefully carried out. Planting takes place in June, July, or\r\nAugust, and the crop is harvested from January until April. For\r\nthe most part cotton is grown by the Yorubas as a separate crop,\r\nalthough occasionally it may be found in conjunction with maize. No\r\nmanuring is carried on, but the crops are generally fair, except in\r\nthe proximity of the Niger, for an unexplained reason. No estimate\r\ncan be made of the yield per acre from native cotton fields, but\r\nfrom 60 to 80 bolls are frequently found upon a single plant.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to other matters in connection with the condition of\r\nthe cotton plant in the country, and the appliances in use for the\r\npreparation of the lint for export, it seems advisable to emphasise\r\nthe main points which require attention in the field. 1. Improvement\r\nof the indigenous forms, by the careful selection of seed at the\r\nginneries, for distribution, and the subsequent elimination of\r\nundesirable types of plant in the field. 2. Demonstration to the\r\nnative farmer of a useful method of combination of cotton with the\r\nexisting field crops, and especially the advantage of introducing\r\nleguminous crops into the rotation with cotton. 3. Special efforts\r\nto be made in those countries outside the oil palm districts, where\r\nthe natives have little else capable of being produced for barter\r\nfor imported material. Alter a series of experimental trials it was\r\ndecided in 1915 to encourage the planting of Georgia cotton in the\r\nWestern Province. In the year mentioned this American variety had\r\nyielded 800 lbs. of seed cotton per acre at Ibadan.\r\n\r\nA number of insect pests of a more or less serious nature attack\r\nthe plant at different periods of growth. The American boll-worm\r\n(_Chloridea obsoleta_) does some damage annually in the Central\r\nProvince (Ugboha, Agbede and Ishan); _Earias insulana_, F.,\r\nthe Egyptian boll-worm; _E. imbricata_, an allied species, and\r\n_Diparopsis castanea_ Hamp., the Sudan boll-worm, are common at\r\nIbadan. The immature boll is often punctured by a scarlet and brown\r\nbug, identified as _Dysdercus superstitiosus_, Fabr., which enters\r\nthe opened bolls also, and exudes a yellowish liquid, which stains\r\nthe lint. The opened boll is also infested with three species of\r\ncotton-seed bugs—_Oxycarenus hyalinipennis_, _O. gossipinus_,\r\nand _O. Dudgeoni_—which do a large amount of damage in sapping\r\nthe juices from the seed and rendering it unproductive. The most\r\nsatisfactory method of dispersing this insect is to place the\r\nseed-cotton in a hot sun for several hours. Both _Oxycarenus_ and\r\n_Dysdercus_ may be trapped by placing piles of seed in the field at\r\nintervals, and treating them with kerosene when the insects have\r\ncollected on them. A small caterpillar belonging to the family\r\n_Gelechiadæ_[4] is often found in the boll feeding on the seed,\r\nand a leaf-blistering blight, probably _Chlorita flavescens_,\r\nappears to be common in several places. A malady, chiefly on stems\r\nof exotic cottons, and known as “black-arm” in Georgia, U.S.A.,\r\nis seen occasionally. The affection is not attributed to any animal\r\nor vegetable parasite.\r\n\r\nThe ginneries erected by the British Cotton Growing Association are\r\nprobably some of the best equipped in the world. The Marlborough\r\nGinnery at Ibadan (Fig. 23) has at present the largest output,\r\nalthough the Jones Ginnery at Oshogbo is larger, and is expected\r\nto receive a greater quantity of cotton for treatment in the\r\nfuture. The third, which is working in the Western Province, is\r\nthe Churchill Ginnery at Lafenwa, near Abeokuta. Smaller ginneries\r\nhave been erected at Eruwa Road, Iwo, Oyo, and Agege in the Western\r\nProvince, but are at present unused. In the Central Province the\r\nIllushi Ginnery on the Niger is capable of treating all the cotton\r\nof the adjoining districts. A photograph of cotton bales at Ibadan\r\nis reproduced (Fig. 23).\r\n\r\nAt Ibadan an oil mill has been erected in connection with the\r\nMarlborough Ginnery, and the expression of oil from the seed\r\nis regularly carried on. The seed cake which is turned out is\r\nfound to be of rather inferior quality for European consumption,\r\nas the excess of woolly seed renders it undesirable for cattle\r\nfood. A very economical local use for this cake has recently been\r\ndiscovered—namely the employment of it to generate gas to drive\r\nthe machinery of the ginnery. It has been found that 6 cwt. of\r\ncotton-seed cake is sufficient to generate gas to drive the 30\r\nh.p. oil-mill engine for nine and a half hours. This discovery\r\nsuggests the possibility of doing without coal entirely at the\r\nginneries, which would mean a very large saving in the cost of\r\nproduction of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe cotton ginned by the British Cotton Growing Association is baled\r\nfor the most part in rectangular oblong form, each bale weighing\r\napproximately 400 lbs. The production of the country has shown\r\na rapid increase, especially in the earlier years, though more\r\nrecently one of the seasons proved a short one owing to adverse\r\nclimatic conditions.\r\n\r\n        Weight cwts.

(“Cotton Varieties,”\r\ncf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, vol. xv. [1917]). Much is expected from\r\nthis new development.\r\n\r\n=MAIZE.=—In the last few years the cultivation of a short-season\r\n“white” maize has been taken up, especially among the Yorubas,\r\nin the Western Province, although the variety is also found in\r\nthe fields farther to the east. (See _Bulletin of the Imperial\r\nInstitute_, vol. vii. [1909], pp. 145-8.)\r\n\r\n         Tons     Value £           Tons    Value £\r\n  1907   9,891    28,520    1913   11,841   40,349\r\n  1908  15,529    51,695    1914     —       5,803\r\n  1909  10,917    34,335    1915      272      941\r\n  1910   5,096    16,689    1916      981    5,064\r\n  1911     867     3,128    1917      876    4,367\r\n  1912   7,899    28,713    1918      405    3,696\r\n\r\nA difficulty has arisen in connection with the preparation of the\r\ncrop for shipment; it having been found that very large quantities\r\narrive in Europe in a weevilly condition. Various methods have\r\nbeen suggested to remedy this, including disinfection with carbon\r\nbisulphide, but the use of this last is dangerous.\r\n\r\nA restriction with regard to the time of buying the July—August\r\ncrop is recommended for adoption by the merchants, in order to\r\nprevent immature, insufficiently dried corn being shipped. It\r\nis insisted, however, in some quarters, that, until the holds\r\nof ships are systematically cleaned out before loading, no\r\namount of precaution on shore will prevent shipments becoming\r\nweevilled during the voyage. (See article on “The Cultivation and\r\nMarketing of Maize” in the _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. vi. [1908], pp. 261-77.)\r\n\r\nExperiments were carried out in 1911, 1912 and 1913 to determine the\r\nmost profitable time for sowing maize. The results were, however,\r\nconflicting, and no definite recommendation could be made owing to\r\nthe irregularity of rainfall.\r\n\r\n=CASSAVA.=—Among the more important field crops, cassava has to be\r\nreckoned. Two well-marked forms occur, which are readily recognised\r\nby the different characters of their leaves, one having the leaflets\r\ndigitate and pointed, and the other digitate and spathulate, with the\r\ncentral leaflet shortened. Cassava forms an important food in many\r\nparts of the country, and is widely cultivated, especially in the\r\nWestern Province. No tapioca is prepared from the root in Southern\r\nNigeria, such as is the case in the West Indies and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n=YAMS.=—In many parts of the country, more especially in the\r\nCentral and Eastern Provinces, the various forms of yam (_Dioscorea_)\r\nare extensively cultivated alone or with maize, but the presence of\r\nfive or six other crops growing upon the heightened yam mounds is\r\nnot uncommon, in the Cross River districts particularly. From the\r\nlatter locality quantities of yams are sent by river canoes to the\r\nlarge ports in the vicinity of which cultivated land is often scarce.\r\n\r\nThe Koko yam (_Colocasia antiquorum_) is also common in the wet zone.\r\n\r\n=GROUNDNUTS.=—The cultivation of groundnuts (_Arachis hypogea_),\r\nupon a more extensive scale than at present, is to be recommended, as\r\nthere are too few leguminous crops grown in the local rotation. The\r\ncolour of most of the Southern Nigerian nuts is probably an obstacle\r\nto their ready sale in Europe; the shell being usually a dirty\r\ngreyish instead of a light straw colour. The kernels are, however,\r\nsatisfactory. It would, perhaps, therefore be advantageous to ship\r\ndecorticated nuts, as is done in the Northern Provinces. Although\r\nnew seed and instructors have been brought recently from the Gambia,\r\nvery little more is grown than formerly.\r\n\r\nThe variety seen in the Western Province is a larger one than that\r\nof the Gambia, and has generally two kernels. The market price for\r\ngroundnuts at Lapita near Oyo was 200 for 1_d_., which will indicate\r\nthe scarcity of the product.\r\n\r\n=SHEA NUTS AND BUTTER.=—The export trade in shea nuts\r\n(_Butyrospermum Parkii_) was expected to develop with the extension\r\nof the railway through Ibadan and Ilorin to the Northern Provinces,\r\nbut the exported product still has its main source from localities\r\nnorth of the Niger. The demand does not seem sufficient to induce\r\nexpansion to a great extent (_Bull. Imp. Inst._, vol. vi. [1908]).\r\n\r\nThe butter or fat is much appreciated in the country for culinary\r\npurposes, and has been found of value in Europe for soap and\r\ncandle-making, as well as for the manufacture of vegetable butter.\r\n\r\n=KOLA.=—Two species of kola (_K. acuminata_ and _K. vera_)\r\nare cultivated, the latter being the indigenous Gold Coast form,\r\nthe fruit of which is said to be especially valued in the Haussa\r\ncountries to the north. The local native names are, respectively,\r\n“Obi abatta” and “Obi gbanja.” In general appearance the\r\ntrees are similar, except that the former has narrower and smaller\r\nleaves. The “gbanja” form of nut is generally pink and divisible\r\ninto from two to three parts (cotyledons), whereas the “abatta”\r\nform may vary in colour from deep crimson to white and be separable\r\ninto from three to five parts. The price paid for kolas in Lagos\r\nis said to vary from 1_s_. 3_d_. to 5_s_. per hundred.\r\n\r\nAlthough a considerable number of trees have been planted and are\r\nbearing fruit in the Western Province, the demand for kolas for\r\nnative consumption is so great that there is a large import trade\r\nfrom the Gold Coast.\r\n\r\nThe kola nut is chewed in much the same manner as the betel nut in\r\nthe East. It is greatly appreciated for its sustaining qualities,\r\nand forms a token of friendship exchanged among high-grade natives,\r\nas a preliminary to an important discussion of any kind.\r\n\r\n=FIBRE.=—Experiments have been made at the Olokemeji Botanic\r\nStation with indigenous fibres, and a small factory has been erected\r\nat Ilaro, where a machine capable of extracting fibre is said to\r\nhave been instituted. The reports upon some of the local Hibiscus\r\nfibres have been satisfactory. These are capable of utilisation\r\nas jute substitutes, and it may be possible to grow them in the\r\ncrop rotation of the country at some future time for the purpose\r\nof export. (See _Selected Reports from the Imperial Institute_,\r\nNo. 1 “Fibres,” pp. 38, 52, 83, 89, and 114.)\r\n\r\nPiassava (_Raphia vinifera_) fibre is prepared and shipped,\r\nespecially from Uwet in the Eastern Province, the export amounting\r\nto 319 tons in 1910.\r\n\r\n=LEATHER.=—A small trade in leather is done among the Yorubas,\r\nand tanners may be met with chiefly in the north of the Western\r\nProvince. The process employed in the preparation of the goat and\r\nsheep skins used is similar to that of Northern Nigeria. (See Report\r\non “Leather from Lagos,” _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. iv. [1906], p. 366, and articles on “Native Leather of West\r\nAfrica,” _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. vi. [1908],\r\npp. 175-81 and vol. viii. [1910], pp. 402.)\r\n\r\n=TOBACCO.=—Tobacco is produced near Ibadan, and large quantities\r\nare sold in the King’s market of that town. It is probable that the\r\ncuring of the leaf is done completely in the sun, as the prepared\r\nmaterial is of a rather light colour and has a mild flavour. The\r\nleaves are apparently rather mixed, and old or immature examples\r\nare frequently included in the same grade.\r\n\r\nExperiments will be taken in hand with a view to the improvement of\r\nthe quality, but at present the local demand is so great that there\r\nis little prospect of an export trade becoming established. Recent\r\nwork in Nyasa-land has shown that good pipe smoking tobacco,\r\nsuitable for consumption in England, can be produced in Africa.\r\n\r\n=SILK.=—The preparation of a silk yarn, carded and spun from the\r\nboiled cocoons of wild silkworms, is a common occupation of some\r\nof the women of Ibadan. The identity of the insects producing the\r\nsilk has been determined to be _Anaphe infracta_ and _A. venata_,\r\nboth of which form congregated masses of cocoons. The yarn is of a\r\nbrown colour, and is woven with cotton into a cloth which is called\r\nlocally “Saṉyaṉ.” It is much valued by the natives on account\r\nof its durability. The silkworms show some sign of becoming scarce\r\nowing to the utilisation of the pupæ as food. (See _Bulletin of the\r\nImperial Institute_, 1910, p. 150; 1916, p. 168; and 1920, p. 319.)\r\n\r\n=COCONUTS.=—The preparation of copra is carried on at Badagri,\r\nwhere a large coconut plantation exists. Great alarm was recently\r\ncaused to the proprietors through the attack of a scale insect\r\n(_Aspidiotus destructor_), which destroyed the leaves of a very\r\nlarge number of trees. The advent of this pest was, however,\r\nquickly followed by the vast multiplication of the numbers of a\r\nspecies of large ladybird beetle, which soon checked the spread of\r\nthe scale. The directions issued by the Forestry Department with\r\nregard to the means of destroying the infected leaves also assisted\r\nin the extermination of the blight.\r\n\r\n=MAHOGANY AND EBONY.=—Among the valuable exported products from\r\nthe country, mahogany and ebony must be regarded as occupying an\r\nimportant place. The largest proportion of the timbers exported\r\nto Europe and sold under the name of mahogany are obtained in the\r\nCentral Province, and are cut from trees belonging to the genera\r\n_Khaya_, _Pseudocedrela_, and _Entandrophragma_, of the Natural\r\nOrder _MELIACEÆ_. Mr. Thompson, Conservator of Forests, remarks\r\nthat a fair number of logs cut from a species of _Guarea_, of the\r\nsame Natural Order, have been shipped, and have obtained good prices\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nA red wood, called locally “Iroko” (_Chlorophora excelsa_),\r\nwhich is in good demand in the country for making furniture, etc.,\r\nhas been shipped to Europe, but at present there is little demand\r\nfor it. A photograph of another timber tree (_Terminalia superba_)\r\nis given (Fig. 24).\r\n\r\nMahogany cannot be relied upon as a product capable of permanent\r\nexportation, as trees are only useful for felling in the vicinity of\r\ncreeks and rivers, whence the logs may be inexpensively transported\r\nto the sea. The rate at which the available trees are becoming\r\nworked out is much greater than that at which they can be replaced\r\nby nature.\r\n\r\nThe export values for some recent years are as under:—\r\n\r\n  1910   £60,191  | 1915   £54,559\r\n  1911   £55,575  | 1916   £49,361\r\n  1912   £78,007  | 1917   £21,282\r\n  1913  £105,440  | 1918   £68,480\r\n  1914   £86,522  | 1919  £116,820\r\n\r\nThe ebony exported from the country is chiefly obtained in the Cross\r\nRiver District of the Eastern Province, but during recent years the\r\ntrade in it has diminished, and it is said that immature trees are\r\nfrequently felled. The sources of ebony are two species of trees\r\nbelonging to the genus _Diospyros_. The value of ebony exported\r\nduring the two years 1909 and 1910 is stated to have been £1,298\r\nand £166 respectively.\r\n\r\nSeveral other trees have recently been examined for export value,\r\nmost of them coming into the mahogany or red-wood class. (See\r\narticles on “Timbers from Southern Nigeria,” _Bull. Imp. Inst._,\r\nvol. vi. [1908], p. 144, vol. xviii. [1920], p. 199, and note on\r\nnext page.)\r\n\r\n=CATTLE.=—The greater part of the moist zone is almost devoid\r\nof cattle, partly owing to the prevalence of “tsetse” fly,\r\nalthough mainly, perhaps, to the less advanced condition of the\r\ninhabitants. As soon as the intermediate and dry-zone country is\r\nentered, small herds are frequently seen. That the presence of\r\ntsetse fly is not entirely accountable for the scarcity of cattle\r\nin the forested region is shown by the occurrence of the peculiar\r\ndwarfed variety with short legs, which is found in Ondo, Ilesha,\r\nIfon, Ishan, and even in the Bassa Province in Northern Nigeria,\r\nin all of which districts “tsetse” flies of at least two species\r\nare met with. (_Glossina palpalis_ and _G. pallidipes_.) It is stated\r\nby the natives that the dwarf cattle are immune from fly disease,\r\nbut that introduced animals succumb to it. The appearance of these\r\nanimals, an illustration of one of which is given, reproduced\r\nfrom a photograph taken at Illara (Fig. 25), is remarkable. The\r\nprevailing colours are black and white, black, and more rarely\r\nfawn-coloured. There is no dorsal hump, and the forequarters\r\nare generally lower than the hind. A second illustration, from a\r\nphotograph taken at Owo (Fig. 26), gives an idea of the relative\r\nsize of a full-grown animal compared with that of a boy. Another\r\npeculiarity of the above-mentioned districts is that the goats\r\noccurring there are similarly short-legged and diminutive; there\r\nis also said to be a stunted variety of horse, which is bred for\r\nuse at Ondo. When the open country is reached, two varieties of\r\ncattle are seen, one of the Indian zebu type, with a large dorsal\r\nhump, the prevailing colour of which is white, and another with\r\na straight back. The latter kind is seen as far south as Onitsha,\r\non the east bank of the Niger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DWARF CATTLE, ILLARA.\r\n\r\nFig. 25, p. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OWO.\r\n\r\nFig. 26, p. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAUSSA CULTIVATING IMPLEMENTS (LEFT TO RIGHT:\r\nI. FATAINYA, II. GARMA, III. SANGUMI), NORTHERN PROVINCES.\r\n\r\nFig. 27, p. 125.]\r\n\r\n=POTTERY.=—Earthen pots are made in several parts of the country,\r\nand are usually symmetrically formed, although no wheel is used in\r\ntheir preparation. The large earthen jars made at Abeokuta are used\r\nin the palm oil, native beer, and indigo industries.\r\n\r\n=FOREST RESERVES.=—These are now being formed everywhere in order\r\nto replace the destruction of recent years. The irregular rainfall\r\nrenders natural regeneration very poor, and artificial regeneration\r\nby means of planting by leaseholders for trees cut down has proved\r\nunsatisfactory. In 1913 some villages in the Central Province started\r\nsmall mahogany plantations, and trees for fuel are now being grown\r\nin several districts. The value of such trees as _Afzelia africana_\r\nand _Triplochiton johnsoni_ has been recently demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =NIGERIA=, NORTHERN PROVINCES\r\n\r\nTerritory held by Great Britain under Mandate is hatched in\r\nRed. [Legend]\r\n\r\n_Stanford’s Geogl.

They lie between 7° 3′ and 13°\r\n54′ north latitude, and 2° 50′ and 14° 5′ east longitude,\r\nand are bounded on the north by the French Sudan, on the east by the\r\nKameruns and on the west by Dahomey and French Guinea. The Southern\r\nProvinces of Nigeria almost completely adjoin the southern boundary.\r\n\r\nThe estimate of the populations and areas of the thirteen provinces\r\ngiven below is taken from the Colonial Office Report No. 821 for\r\n1913:—\r\n\r\n              Area, sq. miles.     Population.\r\n  Sokoto          32,600            1,300,000\r\n  Kano            29,500            3,500,000\r\n  Bornu           33,600              700,000\r\n  Central[5]      23,700              700,000\r\n  Zaria           13,320              402,000\r\n  Niger[5]        16,770              400,000\r\n  Kontagora       27,800              122,000\r\n  Ilorin           6,500              200,000\r\n  Muri            28,700              700,000\r\n  Nassarawa       16,710              600,000\r\n  Yola            11,600              300,000\r\n  Kabba            8,200              140,000\r\n  Bassa            6,700              205,000\r\n                 -------            ---------\r\n                 255,700            9,269,000\r\n\r\nThe total population is thus nearly double that of the estimation of\r\n1907-8. For convenience the Northern Provinces may in places still\r\nbe referred to in this work by the old title of Northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen below there is less variation in the rainfall of\r\nthe different provinces than is found elsewhere in West Africa. The\r\naverages of the following centres for as many years as are available\r\nuntil 1913 are given for comparison:—\r\n\r\n              Av. inches.              Av. inches.\r\n  Naraguta      50·28         Knepp      40·80\r\n  Ilorin        49·75         Yola       38·64\r\n  Kontagora     47·77         Kano       33·65\r\n  Zaria         46·59         Maifoni    27·85\r\n  Baro          46·56         Sokoto     24·86\r\n  Lokoja        45·77         Kataguni   19·87\r\n  Zungeru       41·67         Geidam     15·14\r\n\r\nOf the places mentioned the highest single year’s rainfall was\r\nreached at Ilorin when 65·18 inches fell, and the lowest at Geidam\r\nin 1913 when only 5·76 were recorded. There are localities where\r\nthe rainfall exceeds the highest given here and others where it is\r\nundoubtedly much lower, but no records are available. The highest\r\nshade temperatures have been at Dumjeri and Maifoni (North Bornu),\r\nwhere 120° was attained, the lowest being at Kano, where it fell\r\nto 39°. In Kano and Zaria rain seldom falls between November 1 and\r\nthe end of March, but the distribution is more general in the south.\r\n\r\n=Administration and Political Divisions.=—The administration\r\nof Northern Nigeria was taken over by the Crown in 1900, having\r\npreviously been carried on by the Royal Niger Company. Protectorates\r\nwere gradually assumed, and the country placed upon a secure\r\nfooting by the suppression of raiding, which had constantly been\r\ncarried on by the different Emirs, chiefly upon the pagan tribes. The\r\ndevastation caused by these raids is still visible in the country to\r\nthe south of Kontagora and elsewhere, and the fear of the raiders\r\nkept the inhabitants within or in close proximity to their walled\r\ntowns, leaving large tracts of fertile country unexploited. The work\r\naccomplished by Sir Frederick Lugard, the first High Commissioner,\r\nwas largely that of pacification and reassurance of the people,\r\nand until this had been completed, and facilities for transport\r\nprovided, it could not be expected that the country could make much\r\nprogress from a commercial standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe further opening up of the country by means of roads and\r\nrailways, and the assessment of land revenue upon lines completely\r\nunderstood and recognised as fair by the natives, was effected\r\nby Sir Percy Girouard, who succeeded Sir Frederick Lugard’s\r\nfirst administration. Sir Frederick subsequently returned as\r\nGovernor-General of the amalgamated Nigeria.\r\n\r\nUntil April 1907 the country was divided into fourteen provinces,\r\none of which, Borgu, was absorbed in Kontagora at that time,\r\nmaking the thirteen mentioned above. By a later reconstruction\r\nthe provincial limits of the two provinces of Bauchi and Nupe were\r\nreformed, and the provinces reconstituted under the names of the\r\nCentral and Niger Provinces respectively. Groups of provinces were\r\nthen placed under First-class Residents. Photographs are given of\r\nKano and Zaria (Figs. 32 and 33).\r\n\r\n=Natural Divisions.=—There is less apparent possibility of\r\ndefining limits to the natural conditions of any part of the\r\ncountry than is found in the countries nearer the coast. There is\r\nno afforested zone in Northern Nigeria, although fairly densely\r\nwooded tracts occur in several places near the larger rivers. It\r\nmay be said that grass land studded with well-separated trees is\r\nthe condition of the country throughout, the trees becoming more\r\nstunted towards the northern and desert boundaries. To the north of\r\nthe 11th degree of latitude, the botanical aspect becomes different;\r\nmore trees of the Mimosa group, including the gum-bearing Acacias,\r\nbecoming apparent. Cattle thrive well in this region, where the\r\n“tsetse” fly has not yet been observed.\r\n\r\nHaussa Land, a term applied to the northern parts of the country,\r\nalone among the British West African territories, may be said to have\r\nbeen controlled by an ordered form of government from early times,\r\nand to have had a recorded history. Unfortunately these records\r\nwere destroyed, wherever possible, by the Fulani conquerors, who\r\ncame from the source of the river Senegal and overran the country\r\nat the beginning of the last century, and whose object seemed to be\r\nto endeavour to eliminate from the minds of the conquered people\r\nall recollection of their previous power. In spite of strenuous\r\nefforts in this direction, a few documents have been preserved,\r\nand these, combined with traditions, which have not had time to\r\nbecome completely distorted, show that, in spite of severe wars,\r\nfamines, and other disturbing incidents, the Haussa has maintained\r\nhis characteristic traits.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Haussa race is still a matter of uncertainty,\r\nalthough there is some reason to suppose that it came from the east,\r\nand gradually penetrated the Western Sudan from the north. The Haussa\r\nlanguage, which is claimed to be more in use than any other native\r\nlanguage in West Africa, is said, by Lady Lugard, to be classed\r\nwith Coptic among the Hamitic languages.[6]\r\n\r\nHistory has established the fact that there were seven divisions\r\nor states in Haussa Land, the people of which, although regarded as\r\nhaving come from a common stock, were almost perpetually at war with\r\none another. The mythical account of the formation of these states\r\nrelates that each had particular duties assigned to it; those of Kano\r\nand Rano, to the north of Zaria, being specially industrial. At the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century, when the Songhay kingdom was at\r\nthe summit of its power, Kano and Gober, among other Haussa towns,\r\nwere specially referred to by Leo Africanus on account of their\r\ncotton trade.[7]\r\n\r\nEverywhere along the West Coast the name Haussa is associated\r\nwith the idea of trade; the itinerant nature of the race inducing\r\nindividuals to visit the remote parts of the pagan countries,\r\nthus creating trade routes in all directions. The Haussa trader\r\nof the present day does not necessarily bring goods from his own\r\ncountry for trading, but buys in one market to sell or exchange in\r\nanother. It is by this means that many European manufactured goods\r\npenetrate into localities where no European trader has yet set foot.\r\n\r\nThe Haussa is also regarded as a good soldier, and is largely\r\nenlisted in the native regiments of West Africa under European\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe Nupes, Yorubas, Gwaris, Yauris, and others were constantly in\r\ncontact with the Haussas, and to a small extent the Haussa language\r\nis spoken by them. Nupe is regarded as an ancient kingdom, occupying\r\nat one time a position of great importance. The Yorubas, who inhabit\r\nnearly the whole of the Ilorin Province and the Western Province\r\nof Southern Nigeria, trace their origin from the Phœnicians of the\r\ntribe of Nimrod, and claim that all the pagan tribes of Haussa Land\r\nare descended from them. The Gwaris, apparently, have no records,\r\nbut are a scattered race living among the rocky hills and caves in\r\nthe country lying to the south of Zaria.\r\n\r\nBornu was not evidently included in the Songhay kingdom or associated\r\nwith the Haussa states, the inhabitants belonging to a distinct race\r\nwith separate traditions. Their history in comparison with that of\r\nthe Haussas is of recent date. In 1808, after the successful Fulani\r\nconquests of Zaria, Zanfara, Kano, Katsena, and Bauchi, Bornu was\r\noverrun. Shortly after this a sheikh, from the country extending\r\neastwards from Lake Tchad, believing himself to be inspired to\r\nliberate the country, raised a small army, drove out the Fulani\r\nforces, and founded the present dynasty of Bornu. Some years later\r\nhe attempted to expel the Fulanis from the Bauchi Province, but\r\nfailed, and was compelled to come to terms.\r\n\r\nThe Haussas as well as the Bornuese are chiefly Mohammedans, but it\r\nis only among the higher ranks of the other tribes that a semblance\r\nof that religion has been adopted.\r\n\r\nThe tribes which had migrated from the East brought with them the\r\nagricultural knowledge of the Eastern nations. Among the noticeable\r\nevidences of this may be mentioned the “shaduf,” or dipping\r\nbeam, used for irrigation in Egypt, which is similarly employed\r\nnear Kano and Zaria. The absence of ploughs and the non-employment\r\nof cattle are, however, difficult to account for, as excellent\r\ncattle are common and thrive well in the most populous parts of\r\nthe country. Tillage of the soil is still done entirely by hand,\r\nand, in those parts where the shallowest form exists, manure is\r\nextensively used. Among the many crops grown which are common to\r\nOriental countries, as well as Northern Nigeria, are Guinea corn,\r\nmaize, cotton, groundnuts, millet, benniseed, artichokes, wheat,\r\nand rice.\r\n\r\nAgriculture shows the greatest development in the Province of Kano,\r\nwhere the population is dense, especially in the vicinity of the\r\ntown from which the Province takes its name. The concentration of\r\na large population in this locality was doubtless occasioned by\r\nthe protection thus obtained against local enemies; and, as the\r\nrealisation of the necessity for this becomes less each year, so\r\nwill the inhabitants spread out into the richer lands towards the\r\nsouth. At a radius of thirty miles from Kano, it may be said that\r\nevery available acre of ground is cultivated. It may also be said\r\nthat nearly all the cultivation is continuous, and has been so for\r\na long period, the renovation of the soil being secured each year\r\nby manuring. The mode of cultivation in these localities is for\r\nthe most part shallow, and in many places the crops grown subsist\r\nentirely upon the manure applied. The Director of Agriculture,\r\nin the _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vol. xi. (1913),\r\np. 626, refers to the lack of fertility in the soil and to the\r\ncommon practice of cropping without a fallow for a number of years\r\nin succession. He also mentions, among other matters of interest,\r\nthe recent expansion in cultivation of cowpeas and groundnuts;\r\nthese being respectively third and fourth in order of importance\r\namong the cultivated crops.\r\n\r\n=Implements.=—An illustration is given showing the method of\r\nusing the three important agricultural implements employed by\r\nthe Haussa cultivator (Fig. 27). The first of these is locally\r\ntermed “Fatainya,” and is a curved-handled hoe with a blade\r\nof variable width. It is used for all operations of cultivation\r\nwith the exception of turning up broad ridges and drilling. The\r\nimplement shown in the centre is termed “Garma,” and is a broad,\r\nspade-like hoe, composed of an iron W-shaped frame, with several\r\nstrips of iron riveted on the face, filling the interval between the\r\narms. In the Zaria Province the iron strips are generally omitted,\r\nand the implement is called “Owya.” It is used for throwing up\r\nlarge spadefuls of soil in the preparation of the broad ridges which\r\nare made for nearly all kinds of crops. The last implement is the\r\n“Sangumi,” which is a thin rod with a small blade placed near\r\none end and at right angles to it; its use is entirely for making\r\ndrills for sowing seed.\r\n\r\nAll the fields for growing ordinary food crops, with the exception\r\nof cassava, rice, and sugar-cane, are prepared in ridge formation;\r\nthe latter appearing to average about 8 in. high from the original\r\nsurface. The furrows from which the loose soil has been removed\r\nincrease the apparent height by the extent of their depth, and give\r\nthe appearance of a good form of tillage having been practised. This\r\nis, however, seldom the case, as, except where irrigated crops are\r\nbeing treated, the ground is left untilled beneath the thrown-up\r\nsoil. To compensate for the shallow state of the cultivation,\r\nmanure is applied in large quantity, all animal refuse and ashes\r\nbeing carefully preserved, and often conveyed for long distances\r\nto the fields by men or donkeys.\r\n\r\nThe above conditions apparently apply only to the Haussa race,\r\nthe pagan Gwaris and Bassas resorting to a much deeper form of\r\ncultivation and employing no manure. The Nupes and Yorubas do not\r\nknow the use of manure for any crops except onions and tobacco,\r\nfor both of which wood ashes are the chief substance applied.\r\n\r\nThe crops of the country may be roughly divided into rainfall,\r\nirrigated, and swamp kinds. The first are sown at the commencement\r\nof the wet season, and are greatly affected by the distribution of\r\nthe rain, but include the most important sources of food. These are\r\nGuinea corn, millet, maize, groundnuts, cassava, sweet potatoes,\r\netc. An inadequate or irregular rainy season often causes famine\r\nconditions. The irrigated crops are yams, Colocasia, onions, tobacco,\r\npeppers, rama-fibre, and wheat, the last being almost confined to\r\nthe country north of the 11th degree. Cassava and sugar-cane are also\r\nfrequently irrigated in the drier districts to the north. Irrigation\r\nis performed in the northern localities by means of the shaduf. The\r\nswamp crops are rice, Colocasia, and sugar-cane. The first is grown\r\nupon a flat-dug surface, the second upon high ridges made of swamp\r\nmud, and the third on low ridges bordering the rice fields. The\r\nvillages north of Kano are often entirely built of the stalks of\r\nGuinea corn, and Fig. 31 represents a principal hut within such a\r\nstructure. The fencing of the fields in this locality is generally\r\nmade of the same material, but in the vicinity of Kano itself,\r\nEuphorbia or thorn hedges are more common.\r\n\r\nNear Rogo, fences and hedges are usually dispensed with, paths\r\nforming the boundaries between fields.\r\n\r\nThe following table of value of exports shows the progress in the\r\nlast five years before amalgamation with the Southern Provinces. The\r\nsubsequent years are given at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\n                           VALUES OF EXPORTS\r\n\r\n                            1908    1909    1910    1911    1912\r\n                             £       £       £       £       £\r\n  Rubber                   33,050  40,000  37,900  53,511   [8]\r\n  Shea nut products        70,900  93,050  43,150  40,496  51,409\r\n  Palm kernels             47,150  41,750  66,100  52,637  64,432\r\n  Groundnuts               13,650  16,350   8,150  10,377  18,930\r\n  Gum[9]                    8,850   6,650   9,750   5,436   1,785\r\n  Cotton                    1,300   4,400   1,850     945   [8]\r\n  Benniseed                 2,000   4,000   2,300   2,582   2,972\r\n  Fibre                     1,382   4,061    —        —      —\r\n  Livestock                 2,600   1,300   3,750   6,357   9,132\r\n  Gutta percha (“Balata”)    —       —      2,262   6,695   4,267\r\n  Skins and hides[10]        —       —      5,214  37,809  68,832\r\n  Ostrich feathers           —       —      2,615   7,225  12,621\r\n\r\n=RUBBER.=—The extent of the export of this commodity from the\r\nNorthern Provinces was less generally recognised than that from\r\nthe coast countries, for the reason that the Northern Nigeria’s\r\nexports are necessarily shipped from Southern Nigerian ports,\r\nand have been included in the statistical figures of that country.\r\n\r\nUntil 1907 no separate statement was furnished indicating the\r\nquantity of rubber actually originating from the Northern Provinces;\r\nthe whole produce leaving the country by the Southern Nigerian\r\nports made it difficult to ascertain this. The following imperfect\r\nrecords show, however, that the production was of significant extent:\r\n\r\n  1905.  The value of the rubber exported by two of the leading\r\n          firms in the Northern Provinces was estimated at £101,207.\r\n\r\n  1906.  The amount exported in the second half-year was given as\r\n          556,701 lbs., valued at £34,344. The year’s exports were\r\n          said to be 574 tons. Estimating the whole at the same\r\n          proportionate value as that given for the second\r\n          half-year we have:\r\n\r\n  1906.  1,283,520 lbs.                                    £79,185\r\n\r\n  1907.  1,187,588 lbs.                                    £91,074\r\n\r\nThe decrease in recent years is accounted for by the fall which\r\noccurred in the price of rubber, but is probably partly due to the\r\nextermination of the vines by the wasteful process of preparing\r\nroot rubber.\r\n\r\n=Sources.=—The following are the trees and plants which have been\r\nused for extracting rubber:—\r\n\r\n1. _Funtumia elastica_.—This is only found in a wild state in\r\nSouthern Kabba and Bassa Provinces, and is recognised under the\r\nYoruba name of “Ire.” Small pieces of fairly well-prepared\r\nrubber from this tree are occasionally brought in to Lokoja for sale.\r\n\r\n2. _Landolphia sp._ (probably _owariensis_).—A clean “red\r\nnigger” rubber is sold, and is probably obtained from this\r\nspecies. It is generally of good quality, but not plentiful. It\r\nappears to be collected as a scrap rubber, and is made up in small\r\nirregular balls.\r\n\r\n3. _Landolphia sp._—“Root rubber,” termed locally\r\n“Attifufu,” and called by the trade “Brown cluster” or\r\n“Brown medium.” It is probable that several species of vines\r\nare used for this, which is not necessarily prepared from the root\r\nalone, the whole stem being pounded up. This seems to represent\r\nthe commonest form of Northern Nigerian rubber, the preparation of\r\nwhich was at one time prohibited.\r\n\r\n4. _Landolphia florida_ or _Thompsonii_ (?).—“Paste rubber,”\r\ncalled locally “Ebo,” is prepared from the latex of these vines\r\nby boiling with the admixture of “wood oil,” or the resinous\r\nexudation of _Daniellia thurifera_, until it reaches the consistency\r\nof bird-lime, when it is only capable of being handled in water,\r\nin which state it is sold to the merchants, who accumulate it in\r\ncasks for shipment. It is inferior in quality, and only capable of\r\nexport for cheap manufactures.\r\n\r\n5. _Carpodinus hirsutus_.—“Flake rubber,” called\r\n“Aribedda,” is said to be the product of this vine, which grows\r\ncommonly in Bassa. It is without resiliency and somewhat resembles\r\nthe exudations of some of the species of Ficus.\r\n\r\n6. _Ficus platyphylla_.—“Red Kano rubber,” or “Ballata,”\r\nknown to the Nupe people as “Ogbagba.” This is prepared by\r\nboiling, without the addition of any foreign matter, and attains the\r\nconsistency of a hardened paste, similar to the “guttas” made\r\nfrom the latex of the Shea-butter tree (_Butyrospermum Parkii_). It\r\nis distinguished in the Kano Province by the name “Danko Gawi,”\r\nshea gutta being known as “Danko Kadainya.”\r\n\r\n7. _Ficus trachyphylla_.—This tree is called in Ilorin by\r\nthe Yoruba name “Oapottoa,” and yields a latex which is\r\ndiscoloured pink by the sap of the tree with which it becomes mixed\r\nin tapping. When boiled and allowed to cool, the product is a reddish\r\nhardened substance, somewhat resembling guttapercha in appearance.\r\n\r\n8. _Ficus Vogelii_.—Scrap rubber from this tree is said to be\r\ncollected. In appearance this rubber is often good, but the shreds\r\nbreak up easily.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above, that several of the so-called rubbers\r\nare unlike the valuable kinds in appearance and composition,\r\nand as such are, perhaps, incapable of being used in a pure\r\nstate and for the most important manufactures for which rubber\r\nis employed. All kinds, however, seem to be marketable at a price\r\nwhich is remunerative to the exporter, so that the trade has become\r\nan extensive one.\r\n\r\n=Plantations.=—It has been urged that Para rubber (_Hevea\r\nbrasiliensis_) might be grown upon a large scale in the moist and\r\nwell-watered areas, and Ceara (_Manihot Glaziovii_) and _Funtumia\r\nelastica_ in the drier districts; but the country is not generally\r\nfavourably adapted for growing the first and last mentioned. Ceara\r\nrubber seems to thrive well in climates similar to that of this\r\ncountry, and the rubber made from it is of the finest quality,\r\nbut in many tropical countries it has shown great uncertainty in\r\nyield of latex, and often unaccountable cessation of flow. This\r\nhas caused it to be less favourably regarded for plantation\r\nwork. (Cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, 1913, 1916.)\r\n\r\nMany parts of the country are suitable for Ceara cultivation,\r\nthriving as it does in localities susceptible to long periods of\r\ndrought. In the German African Colonies the method of treating the\r\ntree seems advantageous, in view of the uncertainty of the yield\r\nafter maturity is reached. In these places the plants are put out in\r\nextensive plots each year, and, after they have reached full growth,\r\nall the latex possible of extraction is taken out of them, and the\r\nexhausted trees are cut out, permitting the area to become renovated\r\nby the self-sown seedlings, which spring up in great profusion. Thus,\r\neach year a plot becomes completely renovated, without great expense\r\nbeing incurred. If Ceara planting should be adopted in Northern\r\nNigeria, some such system as this might prove remunerative.\r\n\r\nIn the Lokoja forest reserve, about a hundred acres of _Funtumia\r\nelastica_ were planted in 1906, but these have not succeeded as well\r\nas was originally expected, owing, probably, to want of moisture. A\r\nfew Ceara and even Hevea plants, have been grown at Zungeru and Baro,\r\nbut, as yet, no plantations have been made.\r\n\r\n=SHEA NUTS.=—The shea nut is the seed or kernel contained in\r\nthe green fruit borne by _Butyrospermum Parkii_, called locally\r\n“Kadainya.” The fruit, which ripens about May, is of variable\r\nsize, from that of a pigeon’s egg to as large as a hen’s egg\r\nwhere only one nut is contained, but is nearly twice the size where\r\ntwo nuts are present in the same fruit. The fleshy rind is not\r\nmore than one-sixth of an inch in thickness, is sweet to the taste,\r\nand contains a white latex, which coagulates into a product called\r\n“gutta-shea.” The natives in some places seem to regard the fruit\r\nas a delicacy, and the roads and paths, in districts where the tree\r\nis plentiful, are strewn with the nuts which have been thrown away\r\nafter the fruit portions have been eaten. The nut is quite smooth,\r\nand is readily separated from the fleshy part.\r\n\r\nThe butter, which is extracted by the natives, is appreciated\r\nless than palm oil or groundnut oil for cooking, but is used\r\nas a substitute. In Europe the kernels as well as the extracted\r\n“butter” are employed, especially on the Continent, for the\r\nmanufacture of vegetable butter and in candle factories.\r\n\r\nIn some places the fruits are collected and put in heaps, until the\r\nfleshy parts have decomposed and left the nuts clean, after which\r\nthe kernels are extracted, dried in earthen stoves, and pounded\r\nor ground into a fine flour. This is then pounded again, with the\r\naddition of a little water, previous to being mixed in hot water to\r\nseparate the fat. The latter rises to the surface and solidifies on\r\ncooling, being melted again for clarification by skimming previous\r\nto being poured into moulds made from plantain leaves or maize-cob\r\nsheaths. In this form it is sold for export, and is then known as\r\n“shea-butter.” An illustration is given (Fig. 28) of some Shea\r\nnut collectors resting beneath a Shea tree in the Ilorin Province.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEA-BUTTER TREE (_BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII_), WITH\r\nNUT-COLLECTORS, ILORIN.\r\n\r\nFig. 28, p. 130.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YIELDING GUM TREE (_ACACIA CAFFRA_) AT KONTAGORA.\r\n\r\nFig. 29, p. 131.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCUST-BEAN TREE (_PARKIA FILICOIDEA_) AT ILORIN.\r\n\r\nFig. 30, p. 162.]\r\n\r\nAccording to results obtained at the Imperial Institute (_Bulletin\r\nof the Imperial Institute_, 1908, p. 370; 1912, p. 290), the kernels\r\ncontain from 40 to 50 per cent. of fat, as well as a small quantity\r\nof unsaponifiable matter resembling gutta-shea.\r\n\r\nWhere the nuts are very plentiful, and transport appears to be\r\neasy, the collection is often neglected, and the reason given is\r\nthat there is some difficulty in removing the fruit from the nut,\r\nwhich makes the occupation unremunerative. But it is noticeable\r\nthat the fleshy part quickly decomposes, and the clean nuts are\r\nfrequently seen beneath the trees themselves, although in this\r\nsituation the advent of heavy rain will often induce germination,\r\nand so spoil the kernel. This difficulty is obviated if the fruits\r\nare collected and placed under cover, being allowed to decompose\r\nwithout too much moisture.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Ilorin and Nupe Provinces the nuts are at present\r\ncollected for sale to the factories, but in size those grown in\r\nthe Zaria Province are larger, and are now quite accessible. In\r\nthis latter locality the double fruit, above referred to, appears\r\nto be common. In the tract of country through which the Baro-Kano\r\nrailway now proceeds, after crossing the Kogin-Serikin-Pawa river,\r\nas far Zaria, localities containing very large and prolific trees are\r\nfrequently met with, but the population is scanty, and collection is\r\nscarcely made for export purposes. Trees growing in cultivated areas\r\nare generally recognised as the property of the cultivator, forest\r\ntrees only being common property. Women are the chief collectors\r\nof the nuts in the districts whence the supplies at present come,\r\nand their inability to penetrate far into the forests has sometimes\r\nbeen urged as a reason for larger quantities not being brought in\r\nto the factories. Now that the railway is present, it is probable\r\nthat regular collectors will commence to exploit the forests for\r\nsome distance on each side of the line, and that people from the\r\nmore populous districts will be induced to visit them for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nNo record is available to show the amount of nuts and butter exported\r\nprevious to 1905, but it must have been considerable, as the High\r\nCommissioner in his annual report for 1905-6 says: “The Shea nut\r\nexport trade, which formerly constituted the staple of Northern\r\nNigeria, continues to decrease in an unaccountable way, and is now\r\nan almost negligible amount.” Various reasons are given to account\r\nfor a partial or gradual decrease, the most important of which is,\r\nthat the people who used to rely on the collection of sylvan produce\r\nfor a livelihood, have found a more lucrative employment in growing\r\nfoodstuffs for the troops and Government staff, or in working upon\r\nthe Government roads and railways. But, in spite of this, the value\r\nof Shea nuts and butter exported in 1907-8 reached a high figure,\r\nand placed these products second in order of value among those\r\nexported during the year. The export of Shea nuts in the two years\r\nfollowing showed a further increase, being 3,922 and 9,085 tons\r\nfor 1908 and 1909 respectively. There is a growing demand for Shea\r\nbutter in Europe, and the supply is at present inadequate.\r\n\r\n=PALM OIL AND KERNELS.=—The oil palm (_Elæis guineensis_) is\r\nalmost absent from a large part of the country, and is rarely seen\r\nnorth of Zungeru, being chiefly confined to the vicinity of the\r\nrivers and the forests on the boundaries of Southern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nAn insignificant amount of palm oil is exported, as the local demand\r\nabsorbs practically all that is produced, the kernels remaining\r\nbeing alone exported.\r\n\r\nOnly one variety is recognised in the country, and is that with a\r\nthin pericarp and thick-shelled kernel. It is similar to the form\r\ntermed “Abe-pa” in the Gold Coast. Among the Haussa-speaking\r\nraces the palm is called “Quaqua,” and in the Nupe language\r\n“Yi-ku-niche.”\r\n\r\nExtraction of the oil for local use is generally done by boiling\r\nthe fresh fruits, and a limpid product is obtained.\r\n\r\n=GROUNDNUTS.=—The groundnut (_Arachis hypogea_), called “Geda”\r\nby the Haussas, is seen in two forms in Northern Nigeria, dependent,\r\nprobably, on differences in soil and climate in the localities in\r\nwhich they are grown.\r\n\r\nThe form seen commonly in the vicinity of Bida, from which most\r\nof the exported nuts are procured, has a light-brown shell, and\r\nis similar to the ordinary Gambian kind. The soil in which this is\r\ngrown is red, and, to some extent, this colour is imparted to the\r\nshell. The nuts growing in the northern districts near Kano, where\r\nthe soil is sandy and light, resemble the kind which is considered\r\nthe finest in the French Colonies, and is largely cultivated in\r\nSenegal. In this the shell is pale straw-coloured. Large exports\r\nhave been made from Kano since railway facilities were provided.\r\n\r\nGroundnuts are chiefly employed as a terminal crop in the\r\ncultivation adopted by the Nupes and Yorubas, but in the Kano\r\nand Zaria Provinces, where land is retained for long periods in\r\ncultivation and renovated annually by manure, they are often the\r\nfirst crop grown on opening new land, and are seldom planted later.\r\n\r\nFrom an interesting article contributed by Mr. Lamb, the Director\r\nof Agriculture (_Imperial Institute Bulletin_, vol. xi. [1913]),\r\nentitled “Agriculture in Haussaland,” it appears that leguminous\r\ncrops have recently been introduced more generally in the rotation\r\nemployed among the Haussa cultivators. The author remarks that the\r\ncowpea (_Vigna catjang_) is now almost invariably grown with cereals,\r\nand that there is such an increase in groundnut cultivation that this\r\nhas come into great prominence as an exported crop. This condition\r\nhas been brought about entirely by the establishment of railway\r\ntransport—a result which was foretold in the first edition of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nAll the nuts exported at the present time are in a decorticated\r\nform, and the reason given for decortication is that there is a\r\nlarge saving in weight in carriage thereby. It is, nevertheless,\r\ngenerally admitted that in an undecorticated form the nuts are\r\nbetter preserved in transit, and it often happens that the price\r\nfor undecorticated nuts is higher than for decorticated. It is,\r\nhowever, recognised that if the appearance of the shell is rusty\r\nor dirty, it should be removed before shipment, as this condition\r\nadversely affects the market value. The demand for undecorticated\r\nnuts is for confectionery, and is relatively small as compared with\r\nthe amount used, chiefly in France, for the expression of oil. The\r\nweights of groundnuts exported in 1917 and 1918 were respectively\r\n50,334 and 57,555 tons.\r\n\r\nThe Kano nuts appear to be of such a clean type that it might be\r\nfound more advantageous to ship them in an undecorticated state,\r\nbut this can be ascertained when transport has been facilitated\r\nsufficiently to establish a continuous trade with a particular\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe chief markets for the product were Marseilles and Hamburg,\r\nwhere it was employed for the expression of oil, used principally\r\nfor admixture with, or as a substitute for, olive oil. Although\r\nformerly almost entirely sent to the German port, they now come\r\nmostly to England. (Cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, vol. xvi. [1918].)\r\n\r\n=GUMS.=—In the drier regions Acacia trees of several species\r\nbecome plentiful, but many of these do not seem to produce gum.\r\n\r\nSome of the gum in the Sudan is said to be derived from _A. arabica_,\r\nWilld., which is not uncommon in certain localities, but is almost\r\nentirely unproductive in this country.\r\n\r\nThe tree known in Haussa as “Gawo,” identified as _A. Albida_,\r\nDelile, is perhaps the commonest species near Kano, and one which\r\nproduces a small amount of reddish gum. None, however, is apparently\r\ncollected from the tree in the district.\r\n\r\nThe species from which most of the gum is collected in Bornu\r\nis said to be identical with that called “Karu” in Kano,\r\nof which only immature specimens have as yet been examined. This\r\nis probably referable to _A. Verek_, Guill. & Perr., which is the\r\nmost important source of the Senegal product, and to which Bentham\r\nrefers _A. Senegal_, Willd.\r\n\r\nIn Kontagora a good quality of gum is obtained from a tree which has\r\nbeen identified as _A. Caffra_, Willd. This tree does not appear to\r\noccur plentifully here, but further investigation is necessary with\r\nregard to it in the dry uninhabited regions where it is found. An\r\nillustration of this tree is given (Fig. 29).\r\n\r\nAnother species which has been recorded by Barter from the Niger,\r\nand is said by him to yield “a gum like gum-arabic,” is\r\n_A. mellifera_, Bentham, and may be one of those from which the\r\npresent exported product is collected.\r\n\r\nOn examination of the trade specimens, it is noticeable that the\r\nquality is inferior to most of the Sudan and Senegal kinds, owing,\r\nmainly, to the want of cleaning or sorting previous to sale. It\r\nhas been suggested that an improvement in the quality might be\r\neffected by sorting the gum into different grades, cleaning it,\r\nand spreading it in the sun to bleach. The quantity of gum exported\r\nin 1908 is given as 789,949 lbs., and that for 1909 as 894,287 lbs.\r\n\r\nInvestigations carried out recently at the Imperial Institute show\r\nthat Nigerian gum is little, if at all, inferior to Sudan gum,\r\nexcept that its mucilage is not quite so strong. Gums of the better\r\nclass are mainly employed in confectionery, and for this purpose\r\nthe cleaner, lighter-coloured gums of Northern Nigeria are quite\r\nsuitable. (_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, 1908, pp. 29-60;\r\n1910, pp. 352-65; and 1914, pp. 27-31.)\r\n\r\n=COTTON.=—Three distinct forms of cotton are found in cultivation\r\nin the Northern Provinces. The best of these is that grown by the\r\nnatives of the Bassa and Nassarawa Provinces, and possesses lint of\r\nrather long staple and a good colour, covering a clean seed. The\r\nseed-cotton from these Provinces is brought into Lokoja for\r\nsale. This variety seems well suited to the localities mentioned,\r\nbut, although it has been tried in other parts of the country, it\r\ndoes not seem to thrive so successfully. In making a comparison of\r\nthe lint for Liverpool market requirements, the standard employed is\r\n“Moderately Rough Peruvian,” which is a grade of higher price\r\nthan “Middling American,” with which most of the West African\r\ncottons are compared.\r\n\r\nIn Ilorin, a woolly-seeded tall cotton plant is commonly cultivated,\r\nand, although yielding a fair quality of lint, it is not equal\r\nto that mentioned above. A small proportion of the cotton grown\r\nin the Ilorin Province finds its way to the Ogudu Ginnery of the\r\nBritish Cotton Growing Association, on the Niger, but the main\r\ncrop is carried to various points on the Lagos Government Railway,\r\nand is sold for delivery to the Southern Nigerian ginneries of\r\nthe Association. Small quantities of cotton belonging to this\r\nsame variety are grown in Nupe, Kabba, and Kontagora, but the low\r\nground of the Niger valley does not appear to be very suitable\r\nfor cotton-growing.\r\n\r\nIn Zaria, Kano, and Sokoto Provinces, where the climate is drier,\r\nexcellent conditions exist for the production of large supplies\r\nof cotton, but the population requires to become more distributed\r\ninto the districts remote from the towns. In the above-mentioned\r\nProvinces, cotton has existed from the earliest times, and was long\r\nestablished as an important export to North Africa by caravan. A\r\nsmall-bolled variety with a short stem takes the place of the tall\r\ncottons of the Niger valley. The quality of the lint, although fair,\r\nis of a shorter staple, and the plant is less prolific.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the three kinds referred to, all of which are\r\ngrown as field crops, single plants of a fourth are sometimes\r\nseen near villages, especially in the Bassa Province. This is the\r\ncrimson-flowered tree-cotton identified as _Gossypium arboreum_,\r\nvar. _sanguineum_, and is nowhere cultivated upon a large scale. The\r\nlint is silky and fine, and the seed is covered with green fuzz.\r\n\r\n=Exotic Cottons.=—American and Egyptian seed have been introduced\r\nin many localities, especially in the Provinces of the Niger\r\nvalley. Cotton grown from American Upland seed in Bassa Province\r\nhas been well reported upon, but the deterioration of the quality\r\nof seed reproduced by this kind has proved a serious drawback to\r\nestablishment. It is generally acknowledged that the indigenous\r\ncottons are hardier and more prolific than the introduced varieties,\r\nand are better able to withstand the attacks of the local insect\r\npests. It is probable that the climate of the Northern Provinces\r\nwill be found more suitable for the cultivation of American\r\nUpland cottons, as the indigenous plant of that region more nearly\r\napproximates the latter type.\r\n\r\n=Valuation of Cottons.=—The following table shows the value of\r\ndifferent cottons grown in Northern Nigeria and examined at the\r\nImperial Institute.

Figs. 32 and 33 illustrate views\r\nof Kano and Zaria.\r\n\r\nIn all the localities referred to, cotton is generally cultivated\r\nas a sole crop, in succession to food crops, and is planted upon\r\nshallow ridges from July to September, when the cotton is ready for\r\npicking from December to March. Experiments have been made at Baro\r\nand Zungeru to raise plants during the dry months by irrigation,\r\nbut as this causes the fruiting season to occur about the time that\r\nthe first rain and wind storms commence, the success of this is\r\nvery uncertain. The necessity for the application of irrigation to\r\nthis crop is not apparent except as an assistance in lieu of rain\r\nwhen the season of rainfall is late. There is no extreme drought\r\nthroughout the year, such as is the case in Egypt, where cotton is\r\nentirely an irrigated crop.\r\n\r\nIn the Ilorin district, in the vicinity of Shari, a somewhat\r\nextensive area is seen under cotton, and the mode of planting\r\nis similar to that applied on a smaller scale near Rabba, Jebba,\r\nBida, and Egga. A piece of land is usually selected for a cotton\r\nfield upon which Guinea corn and millet crops have been grown\r\ncontinuously for a long period, and which has consequently become\r\nrather exhausted. This is often permitted to lie fallow for several\r\nyears, after which cotton is planted in drills on ridges or mounds\r\nin July or August. No manure is applied. Generally about a dozen or\r\nmore seeds are put in each drill, and in this way it is estimated\r\nthat about a bushel and a half of seed per acre is required. Picking\r\ncommences in December, and lasts until February, as much as 500\r\nlbs. of seed-cotton per acre being frequently gathered.\r\n\r\nIn Kano, cotton is often grown in alternation with cassava, and is\r\na manured crop. Large fields are not seen, as the land is chiefly\r\nrequired for food crops, especially in the vicinity of towns, where\r\nthe population is dense. General improvements in cultivation, and\r\nthe introduction of ploughing, would enable a much larger area to\r\nbe put under cultivation, and would permit of the fertile tracts\r\nremote from the towns being employed largely for cotton-growing.\r\n\r\nThe above account indicates the direction in which efforts should\r\nbe made to ensure the most fertile tract of Northern Nigeria,\r\nwhere the population is also most industrious and dense, becoming\r\nan important cotton-growing locality. It may be safely said that the\r\nland, climate, and industrious population are existent and suitable,\r\nbut the population is congested, leaving large fertile areas of land\r\nuntouched. Transport difficulties have up to the present prevented\r\ncultivation of products useful for export, and the non-employment\r\nof cattle for ploughing has restricted cultivation to the growth\r\nof crops entirely absorbed by local necessity.\r\n\r\n=Improvement of Plant.=—In addition to these requirements, with\r\nregard to cultivation, a rather better class of cotton is necessary\r\nin the Northern Provinces. The local variety might perhaps be\r\nsufficiently improved under better cultivation and seed selection,\r\nbut such a process would be gradual and require the undivided\r\nattention of an experienced European officer, working in the\r\ndistricts. It has previously been suggested that the introduction\r\nof one of the many Upland American kinds might be advantageous; the\r\nlocal variety approaching that class of plant more nearly than do\r\nthe varieties occurring in the forest regions farther to the south,\r\nwhere the American varieties have been extensively planted with\r\nsomewhat variable results. One variety only should be introduced,\r\nand this should possess cropping and lint records suitable for\r\nEuropean requirements. Georgia or Texas quick-maturing kinds are\r\nindicated, but not the lowland kinds such as are grown in the\r\nMississippi valley.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks apply to those regions only where it seems\r\npossible that the quality of cotton which is in most general demand\r\nin Lancashire can be extensively grown, but are not applicable to\r\nthe Niger Valley. As will be seen by a reference to the table of\r\nvaluations, a cotton exists in the Bassa and Nassarawa Provinces\r\nwhich is comparable with a higher standard grade than Middling\r\nAmerican, the type to be produced in the north. Efforts should\r\nbe made to keep this latter variety free from the possibility\r\nof admixture with exotic kinds, and it is therefore advisable\r\nthat improvement in this class should be confined to seed\r\nselection. American cottons have already been introduced into Bassa,\r\nbut the value of the lint is lower than that of the indigenous kind.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cotton grown in the Ilorin Province, the common\r\nvariety is similar to that of the adjoining country to the south,\r\nand it is in this direction that the crop of the whole Province\r\nwill be sent in the future, as it has been arranged to remove the\r\nOgudu ginnery on the Niger, to which the northern Ilorin cotton\r\nhas hitherto been sent for sale. An illustration is given showing\r\nthe position of this ginnery upon the southern bank of the Niger\r\n(Fig. 34).\r\n\r\nThe most important insect pests which attack the cotton plant in\r\nNorthern Nigeria are three species of _Oxycarenus_, or cotton-seed\r\nbugs: _Dysdercus superstitiosus_, a cotton-lint stainer, the\r\nAmerican cotton boll-worm, _Chloridea obsoleta_, and a species\r\nof _Earias_,[11] identical with or allied to the Egyptian cotton\r\nboll-worm. The last mentioned has only been recorded as yet\r\nfrom the Bornu Province, but the American boll-worm is found at\r\nLokoja and near the Niger in Nupe. The seed-bugs and stainer are\r\ngenerally distributed. In no direction have these pests assumed\r\nlarge proportions, but where they occur the following remedies\r\nare recommended for application. The seed-bugs and stainer can be\r\nattracted to traps of seed placed in piles upon the ground between\r\nthe lines of growing cotton, and the insects then destroyed\r\nby petroleum or boiling water. In the case of the boll-worms,\r\ntrap-crops of maize and Hibiscus are recommended, as well as the\r\ndestruction of the moths after attraction to light at night. (See\r\nProfessor Dunstan’s “British Cotton Cultivation,” pp. 35-6.)\r\n\r\nThe British Cotton Growing Association commenced work in Northern\r\nNigeria by erecting a steam ginnery at Lokoja, followed by others at\r\nOgudu and Zaria. The natives of the Bassa Province were induced to\r\ngrow cotton upon a larger scale than before by the favourable market\r\nestablished near them at Lokoja, but, although the cotton brought in\r\nwas generally of good quality, the supply fell off after the first\r\nyear or two, and in 1908 it almost ceased. More recently there has\r\nbeen some return to cultivation, but the people are difficult to\r\nget into touch with, and have few needs which can be supplied by\r\nthe traders, so that they have remained somewhat inactive and shy.\r\n\r\nThe ginnery at Ogudu acted as an inducement to the people of North\r\nIlorin (Shari) to undertake cotton-growing upon an increased scale,\r\nand as the inhabitants are chiefly of a more intelligent class\r\n(Yorubas and Nupes) than the Bassa people, the cultivation of cotton\r\ndeveloped well.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Baro-Kano Railway created some activity in cotton\r\ngrowing, and satisfactory quantities were brought in to the northern\r\nginneries. The British Cotton Growing Association will probably\r\nsucceed well in the northern parts of the country where a large\r\nrural population is to be found.\r\n\r\nAn example of the development of cotton cultivation in West Africa,\r\ninfluenced by and following the opening of a railway, is seen\r\nin the Western Province of Southern Nigeria and in Ilorin; along\r\nalmost the entire route of the line the agricultural population\r\nhave taken up the cultivation of the plant. This has occurred even\r\nin those districts where other natural products were available for\r\nutilisation to a remunerative degree. It is therefore probable that\r\nthe industrious population of the Northern Provinces, who have no\r\nsuch advantages, owing to the absence of oil palms, rubber, etc.,\r\nwould readily adopt cotton-growing upon a commercial scale.\r\n\r\nThe Baro-Kano Railway passes, however, through an extensive tract\r\nof thinly populated country before reaching the localities from\r\nwhich a large supply can be reasonably expected, and this may delay\r\nthe actual results. It would be inadvisable, in the meantime, to\r\nencourage cotton cultivation in those districts which are still\r\nremote, unless it were possible to buy the crops in advance of any\r\nprospective railway extension.\r\n\r\nThe following statistical statement has been supplied by the British\r\nCotton Growing Association, showing the production in bales from\r\ntheir ginneries, 1906-1909:\r\n\r\n     Year.

A\r\ntemporary check to cotton-growing in Ilorin province occurred in\r\n1909 due to the demand for labour for the railway construction,\r\nand a subsequent one occasioned by the war; but in spite of this,\r\nthe increase of cotton in Nigeria is to be attributed largely to\r\ndevelopments in the Northern Provinces. Cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._,\r\nvol. x., p. 480, and vol. xi. pp. 70, 165 and 656.[12]\r\n\r\n=CAPSICUMS.=—An increasing export trade seems to be becoming\r\nestablished in red peppers and chillies (_Capsicum annuum_ and\r\n_C. frutescens_), plants which thrive well in West Africa.\r\n\r\nIn the Ilorin and Nupe Provinces, the plants are usually grown in\r\nthe vicinity of houses, but in the Kano and Zaria districts they are\r\nfrequently met with in irrigated fields. From the latter localities\r\nan almost unlimited supply could be obtained.\r\n\r\n=BENNISEED.=—The oil seed which is exported under this name is\r\nthe product of _Sesamum indicum_, Linn., and is identical with that\r\nknown in India as “til” or “gingelly” seed. Although the\r\nspecific name seems to imply that the plant is a native of India,\r\nthere is evidence to show that it may have been introduced into\r\nthat country from Africa, where several species of the genus occur\r\nin a wild state.\r\n\r\nThe seed is pale or dark brown in colour, and contains a large\r\nproportion of oil, for the extraction of which it is exported. In\r\nthe East, the dark seeds are said to produce the better quality of\r\noil, but this does not appear to be recognised in Northern Nigeria,\r\nand the crop grown there is composed of a mixture of the two kinds.\r\n\r\nThe oil extracted from benniseed is clear yellow and without smell,\r\nand is said to be capable of being preserved for a long time\r\nwithout becoming rancid. For this reason it is highly appreciated\r\nlocally for alimentary purposes, and is said to be used in Europe\r\nfor making butter substitutes and for mixing with olive oil. The\r\nseed cake furnishes a valuable cattle food and good manure.\r\n\r\nAlthough liable to fluctuation in price on the European market,\r\ndependent upon the extent of the supply of olive and groundnut oils,\r\nthe seed is always in demand, and for this reason it is worthy\r\nof special attention for cultivation in the fertile and populated\r\ntracts of Northern Nigeria.\r\n\r\nA fair amount of benniseed is grown in the country, but the use of it\r\nis so appreciated locally that only a small quantity is yet shipped,\r\nmost of this being apparently sent from Bauchi and Kabba, although\r\nKano and Zaria probably produce much more. The value shipped from\r\nNigeria rose from £5,225 in 1915 to £16,523 in 1916.\r\n\r\nBenniseed is grown chiefly in separate fields, and is seldom seen in\r\nthose which have been employed for a long period under Guinea corn\r\nor millet. It is a sole crop, and grown but once a year in this\r\ncountry. In India, it may be remarked, the plant is cultivated in\r\nboth the spring (Rabi) and autumn (Kharif) rotations, and it should\r\nbe possible to do this in the agricultural parts of Northern Nigeria\r\nwhere irrigation is employed.\r\n\r\n=KANO LEATHER.=—A very large trade exists in the tanned and\r\ndyed goat and sheep skins prepared throughout the country, and\r\ngenerally known under the name of Kano leather, or, in Europe,\r\n“Morocco Leather.” It is said that from early times caravans\r\nhave annually conveyed numbers of these skins from the Kano markets\r\nacross the Sahara to the towns in North Africa, whence they were\r\nexported to Trieste and other ports of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nDuring recent years the caravan trade has almost entirely\r\ndisappeared, but some quantity of skins now come to Liverpool by\r\nway of the coast ports. The value of skins in Kano itself averages\r\nabout 5½_d_., but the cost of transport at present has made it\r\nalmost impracticable to export remuneratively, and a very small\r\ntrade exists in consequence.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of skins, which are tanned, are dyed\r\na bright red, yellow, or green colour, which seems to rather\r\ndepreciate them in the European markets for many uses to which\r\nthey might otherwise be put, undyed and even untanned skins being\r\nin greater demand. (See _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. vi. [1908], p. 175; and vol. viii. [1910], p. 402.) It has also\r\nbeen said that the tanning is often insufficiently done, and the\r\nskins become blotched in consequence. It is noticeable that Kano\r\nleather quickly becomes spotted in the damp coast regions, and for\r\nthis reason it is probable that no great direct European trade will\r\nbe established until better methods are introduced and more rapid\r\ntransport is arranged. There may, however, be a considerable trade\r\ndone in the untanned skins.\r\n\r\nThe best class of Kano or Niger leather is valued at a high price\r\nfor bookbinding.\r\n\r\nIn the country a fair amount of leather is manufactured for saddlery\r\nand horse trappings, pillows, mattress covers, sword scabbards,\r\nboots and hats, elaborate designs being often produced by the\r\nskilful introduction of pieces of differently coloured leather.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the leather the skin is stripped off the animal and\r\nusually pegged out for drying in the sun, after which it is immersed\r\nfor two or three days in a liquid made by pounding the pods and\r\nseeds of _Acacia arabica_ (“Baggarua”), and soaking them in\r\nwater. The hides are then again pegged out and scraped in order to\r\nremove the hair, and when dry the best attain a creamy white colour,\r\nothers being pale brownish. Palm oil or shea-butter is then rubbed\r\nin on the smooth side of the skin, which is worked and rolled until\r\nquite soft, after which a polish is obtained by drawing the smooth\r\nsurface rapidly over a wooden upright blade.\r\n\r\nThe finest and lightest skins are usually reserved for making into\r\nyellow, green, or pale blue leather, and the rest are converted\r\ninto red, black, dark blue or dark yellow kinds. The red dye is\r\nobtained from the stalks of a species of Sorghum,[13] which is\r\ngrown for this purpose, and to which the Haussas give the name of\r\n“Karandeffi” or “Karantudi.” The dried stalks are pounded\r\nup and placed in a calabash, to which a solution of “potash”\r\nis added. A deep crimson liquid results, and in this the skin is\r\nsteeped until a sufficiency has been absorbed by it to render it\r\npermanently deep red in colour. A pale yellow colour is imparted to\r\nthe skin by an infusion made from the root of a kind of turmeric,\r\nwhich is pounded up for the purpose. A dark yellow is obtained\r\nfrom the root of a tree called by the Yorubas “Agbesi.” A black\r\npigment is prepared from a mixture of honey and blacksmith’s slag;\r\nblue from _Lonchocarpus cyanescens_, one of the indigo producers;\r\ngreen or pale blue-green from brass filings mixed with lime juice,\r\ncommon salt, and other ingredients. More recently green aniline dye\r\nhas been imported into the country, and has almost superseded the\r\nuse of brass filings in all the large leather-producing districts.\r\n\r\n=FIBRES.=—Owing to the demand for ropes among the cattle-keepers\r\nof the northern districts and the canoemen of the Niger and Benue\r\nvalleys, it is not surprising to find that the wild fibres are\r\nconsidered insufficient to supply so great a necessity, and that\r\nin consequence a selected species is extensively cultivated and\r\nprepared for sale in the markets.\r\n\r\n“Rama” or “Ramo” is the name which is applied to such a\r\nplant in the Haussa- and Yoruba-speaking countries respectively,\r\nbut although used exclusively for fibre made from plants belonging\r\nto the genus Hibiscus, different species are indicated in various\r\ndistricts. The plant to which the name “Rama” is given in Ilorin,\r\nNupe, Kontagora, Kano, and Zaria, is apparently the same as that\r\ngenerally termed “Farin (white) Rama” in Bauchi and Muri,\r\nand has been recognised as _Hibiscus lunariifolius_; that called\r\n“Rama” in the northern territories of the Gold Coast is said to\r\nbelong to two species allied to _H. Sabdariffa_, and that grown by\r\nthe Yoruba people of the western province of Southern Nigeria, and\r\ncalled by them “Ramo,” has been identified as _H. guineensis_.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance only _H. lunariifolius_ is referred to,\r\nsince this is the species cultivated throughout the country.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the other countries the allied plants are cultivated,\r\nthey are invariably grown upon a small scale, and are only seen in\r\nsmall patches adjoining houses, or cultivated as a mixed crop with\r\npeppers, okra, etc.; in Northern Nigeria fairly extensive tracts\r\nare planted, and the crop is treated as carefully as the food crops\r\nin the vicinity. In Ilorin, Kabba, and Bassa the seeds are sown on\r\nridges in drills a few inches apart, each drill having four to six\r\nplants in it. The sowing in this locality is done in the middle\r\nof May, and the crop is not irrigated, being dependent upon the\r\nrainfall for development. The plants, when they have reached the\r\nheight of six or more inches, do not appear to be adversely affected\r\nby a prolonged continuance of dry weather in the Niger Valley,\r\nbut this is perhaps accounted for by the humidity of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe conditions last referred to do not, however, apply to the\r\nnorthern districts, and the importance with which the crop is\r\nregarded is seen in the fact that it is worth while to irrigate\r\nit. At Fogola the plants are also sown in drills on ridges, but the\r\ndrills are made at about one foot apart from one another, and ten\r\nor more plants are left in each drill. The seed is sown in April\r\nand irrigated until the rainy season commences in June.\r\n\r\nThe stalks are said to be cut after the plant has fruited, and are\r\ndescribed as being retted in a manner similar to that employed for\r\nIndian jute. The unretted “ribbons” as well as the prepared fibre\r\nare offered for sale in the local markets, the former being employed\r\nin the rough state for twisting into rope used for fastening roofing\r\npoles, etc. The prepared fibre produces an excellent kind of rope,\r\nand is in appearance very similar to Bengal jute, although it has\r\nslightly less lustre. Specimens of Northern Nigerian rama fibre\r\nhave been examined from time to time at the Imperial Institute,\r\nand have been satisfactorily reported on. As a result the fibre\r\nhas been actually exported to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the _Selected Reports from the Imperial Institute_, Part I.,\r\n“Fibres” (Colonial Reports—Miscellaneous [Cd. 4588], p. 38),\r\na full account is given of the composition of a specimen of the\r\nfibre received from Northern Nigeria. The character is said to be\r\nsimilar to jute, but it is apparently rather harsh, and therefore\r\nmore suitable for use in rope-making than for spinning. The valuation\r\nplaced upon it was £12 per ton, with common jute at £11—£12. A\r\nspecimen of the brown ribbons was also examined and was reported on,\r\nthe valuation being placed at about £4 per ton, with a remark that\r\nit would only be of use for paper manufacture.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three years, since attention was first drawn to\r\nthe probable value of the fibre as a jute substitute, the natives\r\nof Nupe and Muri have been urged to cultivate the plant and prepare\r\nthe fibre for export. This has been done to a small extent, and the\r\nnatives of the latter province are said to be willing to produce\r\nit at the local price of one penny per pound. At the valuation\r\nmentioned above it might scarcely prove remunerative to pay this\r\nlocal price, but it should be taken into consideration that the\r\nmarket price of jute was depressed at the time that the valuation\r\nwas obtained. It seems that the product may be usefully cultivated,\r\nespecially in the Niger Valley, where river transport is available,\r\nand it is probable that a better price would be quoted if a larger\r\nand regular supply could be relied on. The value of the fibre shipped\r\nfrom the country in 1908 is estimated in the Government returns at\r\n£1,382, and that for 1909 at £4,049.\r\n\r\nAttention should be specially directed to the time of cutting the\r\nstalks for retting, and these should be treated before becoming\r\ntoo woody, when a much better product would result.\r\n\r\nExperiments with Indian jute, as well as with certain Hibiscus\r\nfibres in West Africa, have shown that if the stems are permitted\r\nto become woody, the resulting fibre is harsh and coarse.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the probable production of fibre per acre, there are\r\nat present no data, but it may be stated for comparison that a good\r\naverage yield of jute in India is taken as 2000 lbs. Carefully\r\nplanted and treated in the same way, it is probable that rama\r\nwould give as high a return, judging from the growth seen in the\r\ncountry. Jute in India, it should be remembered, is a manured crop,\r\nbut rama in West Africa is only manured in the northern districts\r\nof Northern Nigeria, being cultivated without any special care in\r\nthe Niger Valley.\r\n\r\n=WOOD OIL.=—Following the order of value shown in the list of\r\nexported products, wood oil appears next. This is the oleo-resinous\r\nexudation obtained from _Daniellia thurifera_, a tree belonging\r\nto the Natural Order _LEGUMINOSÆ_, and allied to some of the\r\nspecies from which the West African copals are procured. This tree\r\nis commonly found in the dry country, but occurs also in the damp\r\nforests, where it frequently attains large dimensions. The wood\r\noil is collected in many parts of West Africa, and is used as a\r\nsubstitute for “balsam of copaiba” in native medicine. The\r\nconcreted resin formed on the trunks of the trees by the borings\r\nof coleopterous larvæ is used for burning as incense.\r\n\r\nThe native use of wood oil in place of “balsam of copaiba”\r\ninduced merchants trading upon the Niger to export it, and at one\r\ntime a fair quantity was sold in England. This export trade has\r\nrecently diminished to a large extent.\r\n\r\nThe substance is an oleo-resin, and when free from oil has a\r\nsimilar appearance to copal. Upon examination of the resin, it has\r\nbeen found to be dissimilar in properties from the various freshly\r\nexuded resins which enter the market under the name of recent or\r\nsoft copal. (_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_, vols. vi. [1908]\r\nand xiii. [1915].)\r\n\r\nThe mode of collecting wood-oil is somewhat destructive, as, in\r\norder to procure an excessive flow, a hollow is scooped out in the\r\nmain trunk and a fire is kindled in the hole thus made. The oil\r\ncommences to flow rapidly after the fire is extinguished, which it\r\nis necessary that it should be before a large quantity of oil has\r\nexuded, on account of the inflammability of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe application of fire to the trees does not appear to kill them,\r\nbut they are rendered liable to attacks of noxious insects, and\r\nare often broken off by winds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the local use of the oil for maladies for which balsam\r\nof copaiba is generally employed, the rubber makers of Ilorin and\r\nNupe add it to the latex of _Landolphia florida_ or _L. Thompsonii_\r\nto make paste rubber. The two liquids are boiled together for some\r\ntime, until the mixture attains a consistency of birdlime. The\r\ndried resin is here used for torches, and in the Egyptian Sudan\r\nfor incense.\r\n\r\n=KOLA.=—Although a large quantity of kola nuts is annually imported\r\nfrom Lagos and the Gold Coast, such a great demand exists that\r\nthe price of kola in Kano and Zaria is very high. The kola tree is\r\nseldom seen in any part of the country except on the west bank of\r\nthe Kaduna river, where the famous plantations of the Emir of Bida\r\nare situated. The kola nuts produced from these plantations are\r\nsaid to be more appreciated than any other, and, in order that the\r\nvariety might not be grown elsewhere, stringent measures are said to\r\nhave been enforced by the Emir, and the nuts were always exported\r\nto the north, where it was impossible to grow the tree, and where\r\na very remunerative price was obtainable. This particular kind of\r\nkola nut is referred to as “Laboji,” and is said to be white.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of kola could be undertaken in the Kabba and\r\nBassa Provinces, especially in the moist valleys protected from\r\nsevere winds by high plateaux, such as are commonly found in these\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nIn the export table of 1907 a small quantity of kola is shown,\r\nbut this probably represents the re-export of produce from the south.\r\n\r\n=COTTON SEED.=—The Lokoja Ginnery has exported a small quantity\r\nof cotton seed each year, but the trade is not a lucrative one,\r\nand the larger part of the cotton seed which is turned out of the\r\nginnery is valueless for shipment.\r\n\r\n=FOOD CROPS.=—The products which have been referred to above are\r\nthose which have hitherto been exported from the country, but by far\r\nthe most important agricultural products are those upon which the\r\npopulation itself subsists, and in relation to which the exported\r\nproducts are merely in the position of a surplus.\r\n\r\nBefore referring to the products regularly cultivated for food, it is\r\nnecessary to mention that the seasons, which in the temperate zones\r\nare closely associated with a rise and fall in the temperature and\r\nits effect upon vegetation, are in West Africa determined to a much\r\ngreater degree by the advent and cessation of the rainy period. The\r\nyear is therefore divided into two seasons, roughly described as\r\n(1) that in which the conditions are hot and dry, and (2) that\r\nin which they are cooler and wet. The vegetation is so directly\r\ndependent upon the timely appearance of the rainy season and its\r\nnormal distribution, that a failure of these conditions, even in a\r\ncomparatively small degree, may have serious consequences and perhaps\r\nproduce famine. In no part of British West Africa is a shortage or\r\nirregularity of the rainfall so severely felt, nor does it affect\r\nsuch a large number of people, as in the northern districts.\r\n\r\nA table is given below showing the distribution of rain in Zaria for\r\nfive years, and of that in Kano for three years. In each of these\r\nit will be seen that the fall in the year 1907 was far below the\r\naverage, and that during the most important months for the growth\r\nof the staple grain crops—July, August, and September—there was\r\na severe shortage of rainfall. The effect of this in Kano was to\r\nproduce a condition of famine, which lasted for about six weeks. In\r\na congested locality, such as exists in the vicinity of the town\r\nof Kano, the difficulty of importing sufficiently large supplies\r\nto afford relief at such a period was great, on account of lack\r\nof transport. The chief crop in this year, namely Guinea corn,\r\nwas an almost complete failure in many places, but the millet\r\n\r\n   TABLE SHOWING THE RAINFALL AT ZARIA FOR FIVE YEARS (1905 TO 1909)\r\n\r\n   -----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n    Month.    | 1905. | 1906. | 1907. | 1908. | 1909.\r\n   -----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n    January   | nil   | nil   | nil   | nil   | nil\r\n    February  | nil   | nil   | nil   | nil   | ·36\r\n    March     | nil   | nil   | nil   | ·09   | nil\r\n    April     | ·76   | ·85   | 2·20  | 1·84  | 3·56\r\n    May       | 5·90  | 9·50  | 3·69  | 1·91  | 5·79\r\n    June      | 7·24  | 5·95  | 7·05  | 6·94  | 6·51\r\n    July      | 7·19  | 14·49 | 3·75  | 7·42  | 13·11\r\n    August    | 15·04 | 16·39 | 4·46  | 14·36 | 16·62\r\n    September | 13·28 | 9·90  | 6·33  | 12·08 | 6·61\r\n    October   | 1·40  | 3·93  | 2·32  | ·84   | 1·74\r\n    November  | nil   | ·04   | nil   | nil   | nil\r\n    December  | nil   | nil   | nil   | nil   | 1·50\r\n   -----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n    Totals    | 50·81 | 61·05 | 29·80 | 45·48 | 55·80\r\n   -----------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\n(_Pennisetum_) crop, which is an early one, and not dependent on\r\nthe rainfall after June, had received a normal amount of rain to\r\nthat time, and was satisfactory; the stored supplies, as well as a\r\nsecond sowing, of this grain to some extent made up for the failure\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\nThe above table has been made out from the meteorological reports\r\nobtained at Zaria town, and probably represents a fair average of\r\nthe rainfall conditions pertaining to the cultivated country in\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe more northern district, of which Kano is the centre, is liable\r\nto smaller rainfall conditions than Zaria.

The first of these also\r\nindicates the necessity for the improvement of agricultural methods\r\nby the introduction of ploughing, the extension of irrigation and\r\ndry-season crops, and the better distribution of the population. The\r\nsecond—the supply of quick transport—is becoming rapidly\r\nestablished, by means of the railway and improved roads.\r\n\r\nThe extension of irrigated crops can only be made in the vicinity\r\nof the larger rivers, or where good wells exist, and it may be found\r\nmore expedient, therefore, that the inhabitants of the Niger, Benue,\r\nKaduna, Gongola, and Gurara valleys should be urged to cultivate\r\nrice and maize under these conditions. The use of the land for two\r\ncrops in each year would be made possible by the introduction of\r\na leguminous crop as an intermediate, being sown later but in the\r\nsame field with the irrigated crop, and being permitted to ripen,\r\nafter the grain has been harvested, upon the stubble. A leguminous\r\ngrain suitable for human food would be necessary in the river valleys\r\nwhere cattle are scarce, but a cattle food could be grown in the\r\nnorth where cattle are common, and where milk forms an important\r\narticle of human consumption.\r\n\r\n=GUINEA CORN= (_Sorghum vulgare_)—“Dawa” (Haussa), otherwise\r\nknown as the Great or Indian Millet “Juar” (Hindustani),\r\n“Dhura” (Egyptian)—forms the most important food-grain of\r\nthe inhabitants of the ultra-forest region of West Africa.\r\n\r\nA large number of different varieties are recognised in Northern\r\nNigeria, and are distinguished in the manner stated below. Most of\r\nthese have a grain which is commonly used for human food, but at\r\nleast two varieties are grown for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe following list states the characters by which the various\r\nkinds can be determined from the appearance of the seed and form\r\nof the stem.\r\n\r\n1. “Asidinono.”—Seed with white shell and black adherent\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n2. “Farafara.”—Seed with white shell and red adherent envelope.\r\n\r\n3. “Boganderi.”—Seed with straw-coloured shell and red\r\nadherent envelope.\r\n\r\n4. “Janari.”—Seed with pink shell and red adherent envelope.\r\n\r\n5. “Kaura-ferin-sosia.”—Seed with straw-coloured shell and\r\nstraw-coloured adherent envelope.\r\n\r\n6. “Bokin-sosia.”—Seed with straw-coloured shell and black\r\nadherent envelope.\r\n\r\n7. “Makafo-dewayo.”—Seed with straw-coloured shell and pointed\r\nstraw-coloured adherent envelope, which scarcely opens.\r\n\r\n8. “Asidigero.”—Small pink-shelled seed with red adherent\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n9. “Mazgua.”—Very large whitish seed with a straw-coloured\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n10. “Karandeffi.”—Seed with red shell and red adherent\r\nenvelope. Never used for food, but employed in native medicine,\r\nas well as for the production of the red dye used for leather\r\n(_Bull. Imp. Inst._, vol. vi. [1908]).\r\n\r\n11. “Takanda” or “Karantalaka.”—The seed has not been\r\nexamined, but the stem contains a large quantity of saccharine juice,\r\nand the plant is grown entirely as a cattle food. Probably identical\r\nwith _S. saccharum_.\r\n\r\nThe first four kinds are regularly employed as food, and are\r\nfound growing as a mixed crop; although the white grains are\r\nmore appreciated and frequently predominate. Nos. 5 and 6 are\r\nnot considered so good for human food, but are largely employed\r\nfor feeding cattle and horses, for which latter purpose they are\r\ngreatly in demand. No. 7 is used for the same purpose as the last,\r\nbut is a rarity and of no special value. These seven kinds are\r\ngrown as six-months’ crops, and are harvested in October when\r\nthe rains cease. No. 8 is a three-months’ cropping kind, which\r\nin this particular resembles “Gero” (_Pennisetum typhoideum_),\r\nas its native name indicates. The grain is much smaller than the\r\nothers, and it is said to be cultivated to some extent in the Sokoto\r\nProvince. No. 9 is a variety which is said to be cultivated in Bornu\r\nin the fertile depressions which retain moisture for long periods,\r\nor by means of irrigation from the rivers. (See _Bulletin of the\r\nImperial Institute_, vol. iv. [1906], p. 226.)\r\n\r\nGuinea corn is permitted to occupy the land for a number of\r\nyears successively, being often grown with “bulrush millet”\r\n(_Pennisetum typhoideum_). In this case the millet occupies the\r\nfurrow whilst the Guinea corn is on the ridge, and this is reversed\r\nwhen the soil from the ridge has been hoed into the furrow and the\r\nprevious ridge becomes the furrow. In many parts of the northern\r\ndistricts it is customary to permit the Guinea corn root-stocks\r\nto remain in the ground for two or three years, and to fill in the\r\nvacancies only with new seed when the old plants die. By this system\r\nit is found that the crops are better assured, as the old root-stocks\r\nwithstand a prolonged drought better than new plants. This custom,\r\nif persisted in, would be a direct hindrance to the introduction\r\nof ploughing.\r\n\r\nManure is applied regularly to this crop in the northern districts,\r\nbut never in the Niger valley. The method of applying manure varies\r\naccording to the condition of the crop. Where entirely new plants\r\nare to be grown, a shallow bed is made upon the top of the ridge\r\nor in the furrow, and the goat, sheep, and cow manure mixed with\r\nashes, and accumulated carefully in the villages, is spread thinly\r\nupon the bed before the seed is sown. In other places, where old\r\nroot-stocks occur, handfuls of manure are applied to the growing\r\nplants in May. This is sometimes adopted where young plants only\r\nare growing. Manure is so necessary for the system of cultivation\r\nadopted in the Kano and Zaria Provinces that every scrap of material\r\nwhich is of manurial value is carefully preserved, being carried\r\nto the fields by men and donkeys.\r\n\r\nThe heads are cut when ripe and tied in bundles to dry, after\r\nwhich the grain is readily beaten out in wooden mortars or with\r\nsticks. The flour made from the grain is ground between stones, and\r\nis frequently eaten in the form of a thin porridge. Two varieties of\r\nNigerian Guinea corn have been examined at the Imperial Institute\r\nand shown to be superior to Indian Guinea corn, though not quite\r\nso good as the Syrian grain (_Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. vii. [1909], p. 148.)\r\n\r\nSmut-blights, _Ustilago Reiliana_ and _Tolyposporium sp._ (called\r\nin Haussa “domana”), attack the heads, and a _Capnodium sp._\r\n(called “derba”), the honeydew produced on the leaves by _Aphis\r\nsorghi_ (cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, vol. xi. [1913]).\r\n\r\nAt certain stages, green Guinea corn is poisonous to cattle, and\r\nfor this reason goats, sheep, and cows are muzzled in the Kano and\r\nZaria Provinces. Local knowledge of this fact confirms what has been\r\nobserved elsewhere with regard to this species, and is explained\r\nby investigations conducted at the Imperial Institute. (_Bulletin\r\nof the Imperial Institute_, vol. i. [1903], and vol. viii. [1910].)\r\n\r\n=BULRUSH MILLET.=—This plant, which is supposed to be of African\r\norigin and is usually called millet in West Africa, belongs to\r\nthat group of grasses of which the seeding head is in a compact\r\nform and in appearance resembles the head of a bulrush, from which\r\nthe common name applied to it has been derived. The botanical name\r\nis _Pennisetum typhoideum_, and the plant is known in the country\r\nas “Gero” or “Giro” (Haussa), and in India as “Bajra.”\r\nAt least two varieties, a smooth and an awned form, are grown as\r\nthree-months’ crops, and are sown either alone or as described\r\nbefore with Guinea corn. It is usual to plant millet seed before the\r\nGuinea corn, generally about the middle of April, or as soon as the\r\nfirst showers are experienced. The crop is then ready for picking\r\nin June and July. If the rainfall by this time has been deficient to\r\nsuch an extent that the Guinea-corn crop promises to prove a failure,\r\na second crop of millet is often put in, and, as very much less\r\nrain is required for this crop than is necessary for Guinea corn,\r\nthe severe effects of a short rainfall are minimised. The grain\r\nyielded by _Pennisetum typhoideum_ would be classed commercially\r\nas a millet, and a sample from Nigeria examined at the Imperial\r\nInstitute was valued at 22_s_. per quarter of 480 lb. (July 1908).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two varieties mentioned which are employed\r\nas three-months’ crops, there is another kind with a smooth\r\ngreyish-white large grain which is called “Maiwa” or “Dauro,”\r\nand is cultivated in the same manner as Guinea corn; occupying the\r\nland for from five to six months. The pagan Gwaris to the south\r\nof Zaria grow this in large quantities, but it is uncommon north\r\nof Zaria.\r\n\r\nThese grains are easily stored, and keep in good condition for a\r\nlong time. Flour is made from the grain by grinding, and both the\r\ngrain and leaves are used for cattle food.\r\n\r\nFrom the malted grain of millet, and sometimes of Guinea corn, an\r\nintoxicating beverage is made which is known as “Gir” (Haussa).\r\n\r\nA fine grass seed called “Acha” (_Digitaria ternata_) is grown\r\nin the fields with millet, and attains a height of about two and a\r\nhalf feet. It is used for making a sort of porridge. “Tomba”\r\n(_Eleusine coracana?_) and “Iboru” are grown in a similar\r\nmanner. The composition, nutritive value and commercial value of\r\nseveral of these food grains are fully dealt with in the _Bulletin\r\nof the Imperial Institute_, vol. vii. [1909], p. 148.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRITISH COTTON GROWING ASSOCIATION GINNERY, OGUDU,\r\nILORIN.\r\n\r\nFig. 34, p. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GWARI TOWN, OPPOSITE MINNA, SOUTH OF ZARIA.\r\n\r\nFig. 35, p. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COW FULANI WOMAN SELLING MILK AT GWARI.\r\n\r\nFig. 36, p. 163.]\r\n\r\n=MAIZE.=—“Mussara” (Haussa) is the name applied to this plant\r\n(_Zea mays_). The crop is more common in the Niger valley among\r\nthe Nupe and Yoruba people than in the higher plateaux of Zaria\r\nand Kano. It is probable that maize requires a larger rainfall than\r\nthe grain crops which have been mentioned above—which may account\r\nfor the infrequency of its cultivation in the dry country.\r\n\r\nAmong the Gwari pagans, inhabiting the country in the vicinity of\r\nMinna, and the Nupe people to the south, fairly large quantities of\r\nmaize are grown and seem to represent the chief food crop. The sowers\r\ndrop only one seed, or at most two, into the drills, where they would\r\nput five or six Guinea-corn seeds. The only variety grown commonly\r\nhas a bright yellow grain and is apparently a three-months’ crop;\r\nbeing sown at the commencement and in the middle of the rains, thus\r\ngiving two crops in the year in some localities. An illustration\r\nis given at Fig. 35 showing a view of the Gwari town at Minna.\r\n\r\n=WHEAT.=—The cultivation of wheat is confined to the drier parts\r\nof Northern Nigeria, where it is grown as a rainfall as well as an\r\nirrigated crop.\r\n\r\nIn Zaria it is frequently sown in October, and occupies land which\r\nmay have been under rice cultivation just previously. Goat manure\r\nis especially applied to wheat, and irrigation is carried out from\r\nwells or by the employment of shadufs on the banks of streams. This\r\ncrop is harvested in January.\r\n\r\nIn Kano, wheat is more generally grown as a rainfall-crop in similar\r\nsituations, and is, in this case, sown in May, being harvested\r\nin September.\r\n\r\nThe variety seems to be constant throughout the country, and\r\nappears to have been established from very early times. The grain\r\nis similar in appearance to the wheat seen in the Nile valley,\r\nand may be _Triticum compositum_ (Egyptian wheat). Specimens from\r\nKano and Zaria have been examined at the Imperial Institute, and\r\nthe analyses made show about 11 per cent. of gluten including 5\r\nto 6 per cent. of gliadin, and the commercial experts consulted\r\nwere of opinion that an unlimited quantity of this type of wheat\r\nwould be readily saleable on the European market (_Bulletin of the\r\nImperial Institute_, vol. viii. [1910], p. 118.) The Kano wheat in\r\nparticular gave excellent results in milling and baking trials.\r\n\r\nAs a food, wheat is regarded with great favour in the country, and is\r\nbought up chiefly by the wealthy classes for making a brown flour. It\r\nmakes an excellent bread, and is in demand among the European\r\nresidents for mixing with European tinned flour for breadmaking.\r\n\r\nIn order to separate the grain from the ear, the dried corn is\r\nthreshed by the village women; thin sticks being used for the\r\npurpose. The chaff is then winnowed in the wind. The Haussa name\r\nis “Alkama.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to Zaria and Kano districts, the grain is said to be\r\nplentiful and cheap in Sokoto and Bornu, but does not appear to be\r\ngrown south of the 11th degree.\r\n\r\n=RICE.=—The cultivation of rice extends over a much larger portion\r\nof the country than wheat. It is said to be especially plentiful\r\nin the low-lying districts to the south of Sokoto, where large\r\ntracts of swampy country exist, which are annually planted with the\r\ncrop. On the banks of the Kaduna river, near Dakman and Dagomba,\r\nas well as in the valley of the Baku river in the Nupe country,\r\nirrigated rice fields are common, and the product from the Nupe\r\nProvince is much appreciated by the inhabitants of the middle\r\nNiger. The local name for rice is “Shinkafa.”\r\n\r\nNear Zaria and Kano comparatively little rice is cultivated, and\r\nwhere seen is generally found in swampy places where other food\r\ngrains are not capable of being utilised. Rice in these localities is\r\none of the few unmanured crops, and is planted at the commencement of\r\nthe rainy season. The harvesting is done about November or December,\r\nand the paddy or husk-rice is cleaned by soaking the grain in hot\r\nwater, drying in the sun and then pounding in a wooden mortar. The\r\nchaff is winnowed, and a fairly clean rice with a slight reddish\r\ntint remains. All the rice appears to be of the same type, and is\r\nheld in high estimation for its nutritious quality. The imported\r\nwhite rices, which occasionally enter the country, are regarded\r\nwith less favour than the local kind.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to develop the cultivation of the crop in the valleys\r\nof all the large rivers, and it seems probable that, with improved\r\nmethods of irrigation, two crops might be grown annually.\r\n\r\nA sample of rice from Ilorin examined at the Imperial Institute\r\nproved to be about equal in quality to average Bengal rice (_Bulletin\r\nof the Imperial Institute_, vol. vii. [1909], p. 149), but it is\r\nimprobable that it would at present prove remunerative to export\r\nthis rice to Europe. A good market might, however, be found for\r\nit at the coast ports of Southern Nigeria, where imported rice\r\nis in demand. It might be necessary, in order to compete with the\r\npresent trade, to grow and prepare a cleaner (less red) variety,\r\nwhich would resemble more nearly the imported kinds, and to this\r\nend the acclimatised American rice of Sierra Leone might be tried\r\n(cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._, vol. xv. [1917]).\r\n\r\n=SUGAR-CANE.=—The cultivation of sugar-cane (_Saccharum\r\nofficinale_) is confined to small patches or strips of land\r\non the edges of rice fields, where it may be said to be under\r\nirrigation. The Haussa name is “Reke.” The preparation of sugar\r\ndoes not appear to be known in the country, and the sole use to\r\nwhich the plant is put, seems to be the consumption of the green\r\nstalks by the inhabitants and their cattle. The variety seen in\r\nKano district appears to have a reddish stalk, and cane is said to\r\nbe a feature in the Maigana district.\r\n\r\n=LEGUMINOUS PLANTS.=—Several kinds of small beans are grown, of\r\nwhich the most valuable appears to be that known as “Wanki.”\r\nThis is a white-skinned kind, similar to, but about half the size\r\nof, the white haricot of Europe. The cultivation of these beans\r\nis somewhat irregular; a few being occasionally sown among the\r\nmillet and Guinea-corn crops. They are apparently never grown as a\r\nsole crop. A similar bean of a brown colour is common in the Bassa\r\nProvince, but the white bean is generally distributed throughout\r\nthe whole country.\r\n\r\nThe “Bambarra groundnut” (_Voandzeia subterranea_) is grown in\r\na similar manner to the common groundnut (_Arachis hypogea_) which\r\nhas been referred to among the exported products. The cultivation\r\nis similar, and the plant is seen occupying elevated ridges. The\r\nHaussa name is “Paruru.”\r\n\r\nAn unidentified bean, which is called “Girigiri,” has been\r\ndescribed as being grown by the pagan Gwari tribes to the south\r\nof Zaria, but apart from the fact that it is much larger than the\r\n“Wanki” bean, nothing seems to be known about it.\r\n\r\nIndian dhall (_Cajanus indicus_), frequently termed the pigeon pea,\r\nhas been introduced into many parts of the country, with the object\r\nof inducing the native to grow a leguminous crop, which would serve\r\nthe dual purpose of providing a palatable food as well as being\r\nbeneficial to the soil, but in only a few localities do the natives\r\nappear to make use of the peas for food. It has been recommended\r\nto grow the plant upon land which has become somewhat exhausted\r\nby the repeated growth of grain crops, and to permit the peas to\r\nremain upon such land for two or three seasons, during which time\r\nthey will yield successive crops. The beneficial action which such a\r\nplant exerts by nitrifying the soil, and the manurial value of the\r\nleaves, which are shed in thick profusion, are important reasons\r\nfor its introduction, but the value will not be fully appreciated\r\nuntil it has been adopted generally as a food.\r\n\r\n=SOYA BEAN.=—The Manchurian or soya bean (_Glycine hispida_ or\r\n_soja_), which has the additional merit of yielding about 15 per\r\ncent. of a valuable oil, and which is highly appreciated as another\r\nkind of dhall in India, is being experimented with in various parts\r\nof British West Africa (see _Bulletin of the Imperial Institute_,\r\nvol. viii. [1910], p. 40).\r\n\r\nThe recent expansion in the cultivation of leguminous crops is a\r\npromising step.\r\n\r\n=CASSAVA.=—Among the Haussas as well as the Yorubas and Nupes, the\r\ncultivation of cassava (_Manihot utilissima_) is extensively carried\r\non. In Haussa cultivation it is an unmanured plant, and is usually\r\ngrown in separate fields surrounded by mud walls, thorn hedges,\r\nor Guinea-corn matting. The ground from which a crop of cassava has\r\nbeen harvested is rarely used for Guinea corn; the succeeding crop\r\nbeing usually cotton, with the application of manure. In the Nupe\r\ncountry, near Bida, cassava is frequently employed as a shade crop\r\nfor onions; in this case being planted around the onion beds and\r\nobtaining the benefit of the high state of cultivation, manuring\r\nand irrigation which is applied to that crop. Cassava grown under\r\nthese conditions is planted twenty days later than the onions,\r\nand is pulled up a month later.\r\n\r\nThe pagan tribes of Zaria, and the other provinces where they are\r\nin greater numbers, do not seem to plant cassava. The Haussa name\r\ngiven to the plant is “Rogo.”\r\n\r\n=YAMS= (_Dioscorea sativa_, etc.).—These climbers are commonly\r\ngrown in the moist valley of the Niger and in the Yoruba country of\r\nIlorin, but are rare and only an irrigated crop in the more northern\r\ncountries. Where they are seen, they are planted from root eyes upon\r\nhigh mounds with ditches dammed to retain the water between them,\r\nand, until the plant has grown up as a trailer upon the ground,\r\nsome feet in length, no supports are put in. At this time, however,\r\nthe straw covers, which it is customary to place on the apex of the\r\nyam mounds, are removed and an elaborate system of stakes, to the\r\ntop of each of which strings are tied and conducted to the ground\r\nnear the growing plant, are put in, and the plants to the number\r\nof four or more are trained to grow towards the top of each stake.\r\n\r\nThe large white yam is chiefly grown, and is called in Haussa\r\n“Doya.” Yams attain large dimensions in the damp localities,\r\nbut are small in the drier places.\r\n\r\n_Colocasia antiquorum_, called by the Haussas “Kamu,” is usually\r\nreferred to as the koko yam and is rarely grown. A few may be seen\r\nin the wet localities and near Zaria, where they are planted in\r\nswamps upon high mounds or ridges.\r\n\r\n=SWEET POTATOES.=—This crop is grown everywhere, and is nearly\r\nalways unmanured. It is said that it forms the occupant of the land\r\nupon which Guinea corn and millet are repeatedly grown in some parts\r\nof the Kano district in the second and eighth year—_i.e._ twice\r\nin a period of eight years. In the year of plantation, the ridges\r\nare said to be heightened. Near Bida very high beds are made for\r\nit, resembling flat-topped mounds, with an area of sixteen or more\r\nsquare feet. The Haussas apply the name “Dankali” to the root,\r\nwhich is usually of the small white variety.\r\n\r\n=Artichokes and small Root Crops.=—The Jerusalem artichoke\r\n(_Helianthus tuberosus_) called “Gwaza,” as well as “Rizga”\r\n(_Plectranthus sp._) and “Tumuku” (probably _Plectranthus sp._)\r\nare cultivated by the people living to the south of Zaria Town.\r\n\r\n“Gwaza” seems to be less planted than “Rizga,” the latter\r\nbeing carefully grown upon selected ground which has been previously\r\nhoed and levelled, the surface being covered over with branches of\r\n_Bauhinia reticulata_ and other forest plants until the stems of\r\nthe crop have reached a height of one foot or more. Single stems\r\nspring from the root eyes which are planted. “Tumuku” resembles\r\n“Gwaza” in appearance, but comes up in clusters of stems and\r\nis planted upon mounds.\r\n\r\nAll the above roots are used in the manner in which the potato is\r\nemployed in Europe; cassava alone being pounded to make a kind of\r\ndough ball, in addition to being eaten in chopped up and boiled form.\r\n\r\n=Onions.=—Two kinds of onions are cultivated throughout the\r\ncountry: _Allium cepa_, the large onion which is seen to perfection\r\nin the Kano markets, and _Allium ascalonicum_ which is usually\r\ntermed the shallot, and is cultivated to a larger extent in the\r\nlocalities where manure is scarce.\r\n\r\nThe variety of large onion grown in Kano is pink upon the outside,\r\nand for this reason, according to inquiries conducted by the Imperial\r\nInstitute, is said to be quite unsuitable for the English market;\r\nthe white Egyptian onion being preferred.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=—The cultivation of onions is, perhaps, more\r\ncarefully carried out than that of any other crop, and may be\r\ndescribed from that seen at Lemu in Nupe. The seed is sown closely\r\nin beds of soil which have previously been enriched with manure, and\r\nthe surface is covered with straw until the young plants are a few\r\ninches in height. Transplanting into new beds, which are strewn with\r\ncow and goat manure, is the next operation, the plants being put in\r\nat about 4-6 inches apart. The whole cultivation is done during the\r\ndry season, and the beds are irrigated by means of channels supplied\r\nwith water raised from streams or wells, in the north by shadufs,\r\nor in the Nupe country by people conveying the water in calabashes.\r\n\r\nThe market price varies greatly in different districts, and is\r\nimmediately influenced by any reduced supply. There is said to be\r\na very good demand for the large onions in the Southern Nigerian\r\nmarkets, and there should be no difficulty in getting them to Lagos,\r\nas they have been brought from Kano to London in good condition.\r\n\r\n=Minor Crops.=—Okra (_Hibiscus esculentus_), “Kubiewa,” a\r\nspecies of Solanum resembling a small tomato called “Yalo,” the\r\nsorrel Hibiscus (_H. Sabdariffa_) called “Yakwa,” a pumpkin\r\ncalled “Kubiwa,” and the aubergine (_Solanum melongena_),\r\nare grown upon a small scale, and chiefly in the vicinity of houses.\r\n\r\n=OTHER FIELD CROPS.= =Dye Plants.=—Indigo is the chief dye used\r\nin the country, and is prepared in the northern provinces from a\r\nspecies of Indigofera, which has not been accurately determined.\r\n\r\nIn Ilorin and Kabba the plant used is _Lonchocarpus cyanescens_,\r\nand the wild trees of this species may be seen preserved in the\r\ncultivated fields.\r\n\r\nCamwood, a name applied to the red wood obtained from several\r\nspecies of _Pterocarpus_ and from _Baphia nitida_, in different\r\nparts of West Africa, is obtained chiefly from _P. erinaceus_\r\nin Northern Nigeria, and is used by the natives for staining the\r\nskin. It is preserved in the fields cleared for grain cultivation.\r\n\r\nHenna is obtained from _Lawsonia inermis_, which is regularly\r\nplanted as a sole crop in the northern provinces and Kontagora. The\r\nuse of it is generally to replace camwood as a red dye where that\r\ntree is scarce.\r\n\r\n=Tobacco.=—The cultivation of tobacco (_Nicotiana tabacum_) is\r\ncarried on in almost every part of the country, but for native use\r\nis generally made into snuff or into ropes, plaits, and targets,\r\nfor sale in those places where it is smoked. (Cf. _Bull. Imp. Inst._,\r\nvol. xv. [1917], p. 32.)\r\n\r\nThe crop is usually grown in the river valleys, and is irrigated\r\ncarefully. Manure in the form of house sweepings, ashes, and\r\ncattle-shed refuse is always applied, and the crop consists of leaves\r\nof all sizes and ages stripped from the plant at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the tobacco usually consists in drying the\r\nleaves spread upon mats or upon sand in the sun. When flaccid they\r\nare twisted into ropes or plaits in the form in which they are\r\nafterwards sold, or they are completely dried and pounded up. In\r\nIlorin an attempt has been made to prepare the leaves tied up\r\nin flat bundles, and this method has more recently been tried at\r\nthe Baro prison farm, but the previous curing has generally proved\r\ninefficient and requires more attention. It is unlikely that tobacco\r\nfit for export will be produced except under expert guidance.\r\n\r\n=MISCELLANEOUS.= =Beeswax.=—Bees are kept in many of the large\r\nvillages, and are seen in hives placed in trees near the large towns\r\nin Kano and Zaria especially. Honey is employed in the country\r\nas a substitute for sugar. The wax is not greatly valued, and is\r\nfrequently thrown away, although it seems to be of fair quality.\r\n\r\n=Locust Bean.=—The tree which furnishes the well-known locust bean\r\n(_Parkia filicoidea_) is called “Dorowa” by the Haussas. The\r\nbeans, which are produced in clusters, contain a sweet-tasting yellow\r\nflour-like substance, which is used for making a beverage. In this\r\nflour-like substance the flattened seeds are placed, and these\r\nare greatly appreciated for making into cakes, in the process of\r\nwhich they are boiled and apparently decomposed. The empty pods\r\nof the bean are boiled and used for making a strong cement used in\r\nflooring, etc. The pods have been examined at the Imperial Institute,\r\nand appear to be unsuitable for export as a feeding-stuff owing to\r\ntheir fibrous nature (see Report by Professor Dunstan on “Cotton,\r\nGum, and Other Economic Products from Northern Nigeria” (Cd. 2778\r\n[1905]), p. 21). Fig. 30 shows a locust bean tree in Ilorin.\r\n\r\n=Date Palms= (_Phœnix dactylifera_) and the fruit of the Run palm\r\n(_Borassus flabellifer_), “Giginia” (Haussa), are used for\r\nfood and are sometimes sold in the markets towards the south,\r\nbeing commonly seen in Kano.\r\n\r\n=CATTLE.=—Large numbers of cattle are moved about through the\r\ncountry north of the 11th degree, where the tsetse fly does\r\nnot appear to occur. The “Cow Fulani” is the race whose\r\nwork is confined to the care of cattle and the sale of milk and\r\nbutter. These people have no fixed abode, but move with the cattle\r\nto localities suitable to the season. An illustration is given of\r\na Cow Fulani woman selling milk at Gwari, a town south of Zaria\r\n(Fig. 36). The cattle are large and humped similar to the Indian\r\nZebu type, although in some places the straight-backed kind, which\r\nare common in the south, are seen.\r\n\r\n=SILK.=—Four kinds of silkworm are collected for the spinning\r\nof yarn used in the embroidery on the Haussa gowns. The best of\r\nthese is that which feeds upon the Tamarind tree, “Tsamia,”\r\nand is termed “Tsamian tsamia.” The silk cocoons are collected\r\nin Bauchi Province and are boiled in water with wood ashes, and\r\nsubsequently washed. The silk becomes nearly white, and is carded\r\nand spun into yarn in the same manner as cotton. The species of\r\ninsect which produces this silk has not yet been identified, but\r\nis almost certainly referable to the genus _Anaphe_ (cf. p. 117).\r\n\r\nA second quality of silk is that called “Tsamian doka,” and is\r\nobtained from the cocoon masses produced by the larvæ of _Anaphe\r\nMoloneyi_, which are found in the same locality, feeding upon the\r\n“Bokin doka” tree, which has been determined to be a species\r\nof _Macrolobium_. Several hundred worms congregate together and\r\nform a solid mass of pale brown tubular cocoons upon the bark of\r\nthe tree, covering the outer surface with a whitish envelope of\r\nsilk. This silk is treated in the same manner as the other, but,\r\nafter boiling and washing, does not become white. Two other species,\r\nwhich are used for the same purpose, are called “Tsamian fakali”\r\nand “Tsamian bauri,” and feed on another species of _Macrolobium_\r\nand a _Ficus_ respectively. They produce inferior kinds of silk.\r\n\r\nMuch interest is attached to these Anaphe silks, which, in recent\r\nyears, have been developed in the German Colonies of East Africa,\r\nespecially, on a commercial scale. It is reported that, just\r\nprevious to the declaration of war, German agents in British\r\nWest Africa made endeavours to obtain as much of the wild silk\r\nas possible from Nigeria. Plantations of a species of _Bridelia_,\r\nthe common food plant of _Anaphe infracta_, were made in the late\r\nGerman Colonies, and special machinery was in use there for the\r\nproduction of a commercial silk.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give the values of the chief exported products\r\nfrom Nigeria as a whole, from 1913 to 1919:—\r\n\r\n                           1913        1914
