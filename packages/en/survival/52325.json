During the\r\nfieldwork several successive custodians or superintendents and several\r\npark naturalists urged that upon completion of my professional paper I\r\nprepare a brief account of the geology of the Monument in terms\r\nunderstandable by laymen, and which could be sold at the Visitor Center.\r\nThis I was happy to do and there resulted “The geologic story of\r\nColorado National Monument,”[2] published by the Colorado and Black\r\nCanyon Natural History Association in cooperation with the National Park\r\nService. This report contained colored sketches by John R. Stacy and a\r\ncolored cover, but the photographs and many of the drawings were\r\nreproduced in black and white.\r\n\r\nLater, after I had prepared popular style reports containing mostly\r\ncolor photographs on Canyonlands[3] and Arches[4] National Parks,\r\nofficials of Colorado National Monument and I discussed the possibility\r\nof preparing a revised and enlarged edition of my 1965 report containing\r\nmainly color photographs, inasmuch as the supply of the black and white\r\nedition was nearing exhaustion, and later became out of print. At the\r\nmeeting in the Monument on June 8, 1976, attended by Robert (Bob) E.\r\nBenton, Superintendent, A. J. (Jerry) Banta, Supervising Park Ranger,\r\nMargaret Short, Park Naturalist and Secretary of the Natural History\r\nAssociation, and me, it was agreed that: (1) A revised and enlarged\r\nedition containing mostly color photographs should be prepared for\r\npublication as a bulletin of the U.S. Geological Survey, and (2) that\r\nthe Colorado and Black Canyon Natural History Association gave its\r\npermission for use of any or all of the copyrighted material in the\r\nfirst edition. The present report resulted.\r\n\r\nThe cover is a duotone of a 9- × 12-cm infrared photograph of\r\nIndependence Monument taken by me. (See also fig. 6.) Most of the color\r\nphotographs were taken by me on 4- × 5-inch or 9- × 12-cm tripod mounted\r\ncameras using lenses of several focal lengths, but I took some with\r\n35-mm cameras. Some of the color photographs and all the black and white\r\nones were taken by those credited in the captions, to whom grateful\r\nacknowledgment is made. The points from which most of the photographs\r\nwere taken are shown in figure 26.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: West side of Otto’s Monument\r\n    ROCK OF AGES\r\n    CROSS OF AGES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        History of the Monument\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of how Colorado National Monument came into being is as\r\ncolorful as the canyons and cliffs themselves. The fantastic canyon\r\ncountry had a magical attraction for John Otto[5] (fig. 1) who, in 1906,\r\ncamped near the northeastern mouth of Monument Canyon and began building\r\ntrails into the canyons and onto the mesas—the high tablelands that\r\nseparate the deep canyons. He did this back-breaking work simply because\r\nhe wanted to and so that others could share the beauty of this wild\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Otto got the Grand Junction Chamber of Commerce to petition\r\nSecretary of the Interior James A. Garfield to set aside the area as a\r\nNational Monument. Otto’s dream came true on May 24, 1911, when\r\nPresident William Howard Taft signed the proclamation creating the\r\nMonument. On June 14, Otto climbed to the top of Independence Monument\r\n(fig. 6) where he placed the Stars and Stripes to celebrate Flag Day.\r\nFor several years thereafter Otto placed the flag atop Independence\r\nMonument on July 4th to celebrate Independence Day.\r\n\r\nUntil about 1921 the only routes into the Monument proper were John\r\nOtto’s trails, but in that year the ranchers of Glade Park joined with\r\nOtto in building the steep, twisting Serpents Trail from No Thoroughfare\r\nCanyon to the mesa above—a much shorter route to Grand Junction. It had\r\n54 switchbacks and climbed about 1,500 feet in 2½ miles. The Serpents\r\nTrail was included in the Monument in 1933 and was used until 1950 when\r\nan easier route was built up the west side of No Thoroughfare Canyon and\r\nthrough a tunnel to the top of the mesa (figs. 3, 56). The Serpents\r\nTrail has been preserved as an interesting foot trail (fig. 55), which\r\ncan be hiked downhill in an hour or so. A parking area near the foot of\r\nthe trail allows one member of a group to drive ahead to await the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN OTTO, fantastic father of Colorado National\r\n    Monument, and his helpers. Photograph courtesy Grand Junction\r\n    Chamber of Commerce. (Fig. 1)]\r\n\r\nIn 1924 John Otto got the idea that the Monument should include a herd\r\nof big game, so he talked the Colorado Game and Fish Department into\r\nshipping six young elk, and he got the local Elks Lodge to pay the\r\ntransportation costs. The elk were turned loose in Monument Canyon, but\r\nthey found the sparse vegetation and scant water supply ill suited to\r\ntheir needs, so after a few years they found a way out over the rim and\r\nmigrated about 20 miles south of the Monument to lush high country where\r\nthey joined with native elk and multiplied to become the ancestors of\r\nthe present fine herd on Piñon Mesa (shown in fig. 34_D_). Occasionally\r\na few return to the Monument and may be seen mainly in Ute Canyon.\r\nNative mule deer are frequently seen in and near the Monument.\r\n\r\nFar from being discouraged, Otto then hatched the idea to start a\r\nbuffalo[6] herd to be purchased by donations of buffalo nickels from\r\nschool children and by contributions from the Odd Fellows and others. He\r\nfinally raised enough money to get the patient Game and Fish Department\r\nto send him two cows and one bull. Unfortunately the bull died, so Otto\r\ntalked the National Park Service into shipping him a bull from\r\nYellowstone National Park. This time success crowned his efforts, and\r\nthe small herd eventually multiplied to as many as 45 animals, but\r\ngenerally the herd has been kept at about 20-25 head ever since. You may\r\nspot some of them when you gaze down into Monument or Ute Canyons or\r\nwhen you drive past the northeastern boundary. Rarely, you may spot one\r\nin Red Canyon.\r\n\r\nAt the northeast corner of Fourth Street and Ute Avenue in Grand\r\nJunction is a most unusual object, which illustrates yet another\r\npeculiarity of John Otto—fantastic father of Colorado National Monument\r\n(fig. 2). Its history is best told by quoting from Al Look,[7] though\r\nits purpose still remains a mystery.\r\n\r\n  One day a horse drawn dray backed up to a vacant lot on Grand\r\n  Junction’s Main Street [corner 6th] and unloaded a granite cube four\r\n  feet square, carved on two sides. It weighed more than a ton and Otto\r\n  supervised the setting.\r\n\r\n  One side [now facing west and not visible in fig. 2] showed a three\r\n  foot circle containing a swastika with a five pointed star in each\r\n  quarter. Above the emblem was carved “Rock of Ages” and below read\r\n  “Cross of Ages.” The second side [now facing south, and shown in fig.\r\n  2] was beyond normal comprehension. Two large W’s on either side of a\r\n  small swastika were over the letters or initials P.P., then four chain\r\n  links with the letters T, H, L, J. inscribed, followed by the initials\r\n  I.E. Below on the left was “1918,” over “Year 1”. On the right was\r\n  “Old Count” and under it “New Count.” Between them stands the word\r\n  ‘MARCH.’ Below this are abbreviations for the seven days of the week\r\n  with the figure 1 under MON ending with a 6 under SAT. The bottom line\r\n  [most of which is barely visible in the photograph] contained the\r\n  figure 7 in a circle, a carpenter’s square, a small rectangle,\r\n  probably representing a level, a plumb bob, a carpenter’s compass and\r\n  a circle showing the western hemisphere. That is all. It made sense to\r\n  John Otto because from somewhere he gathered considerable money to\r\n  have this monument carved by the local gravestone merchant. It stood\r\n  for several years to mystify pedestrians, and was finally moved beside\r\n  the Redlands road to the [east entrance of] Colorado Monument where it\r\n  is now hidden by weeds.[8]\r\n\r\nIt was still there in the 50’s when my family and I were startled to\r\nfind it. We were afraid it might be lost forever so are glad it finally\r\nfound a safe resting place on a concrete slab at the museum. I shall\r\ngreatly appreciate hearing from any reader who can decipher this enigma.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JOHN OTTO’S MONUMENT, at southwest corner of the\r\n    Historical Museum and Institute of Western Colorado, at northeast\r\n    corner of Fourth Street and Ute Avenue, Grand Junction. View looking\r\n    north. Face is 4 feet square. (Fig. 2)]\r\n\r\nOtto’s rock is at the southwest corner of The Historical Museum and\r\nInstitute of Western Colorado. The main attraction inside is a life-size\r\nskeleton of _Allosaurus_ (fig. 23), whose bones are exact plastic\r\nreplicas of real ones at the museum of Brigham Young University, at\r\nProvo, Utah. The painstaking casting of the “bones” and assembly of the\r\nself-supporting skeleton was done by Al T. Look, son of author Al Look\r\nlisted under “References.” The museum also houses other items of\r\ninterest from the Grand Junction area.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the scenic Rim Rock Drive through the Monument was begun\r\nby the National Park Service about 1931 using workers from the Civilian\r\nConservation Corps, and the drive eventually was completed to join roads\r\nfrom Fruita and Grand Junction. The route from Fruita includes a winding\r\nroad up Fruita Canyon and through two tunnels to the mesa (figs. 3, 44,\r\n45).\r\n\r\nA modern Visitor Center, new housing facilities for park personnel,\r\nadditions to the campgrounds, the Devils Kitchen Picnic Area near the\r\nEast Entrance, several self-guiding nature trails, and additional\r\noverlooks and roadside exhibits were completed in 1964 as part of the\r\nMission 66 program of the National Park Service.\r\n\r\nThe Monument originally included 13,749 acres, but boundary changes in\r\n1933 and 1939 increased the total to 17,660 acres, and the inclusion of\r\nall of No Thoroughfare Canyon and other boundary adjustments in 1978\r\nincreased the size to about 20,457 acres, or about 32 square miles (see\r\nmap, fig. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Early History of the Region\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Prehistoric People\r\n\r\nJohn Otto, early explorers, and even the Ute Indians who once hunted in\r\nthe area were by no means the first people to view the Monument, in fact\r\nthey were “Johnnies-come-lately.” Considerable evidence indicates that\r\nprehistoric people inhabited the area thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MAP OF COLORADO NATIONAL MONUMENT, showing location\r\n    in Colorado, boundaries, streams, highways and roads, principal\r\n    trails, named features, overlooks, and—in triangles—trip guides\r\n    localities. The trip guides numbers correspond to the numbers in the\r\n    right margins of the section entitled “Trips through and around the\r\n    Monument.” Visitors are given pamphlets at the two entrance stations\r\n    and may purchase other reports and maps at the Visitor Center. (Fig.\r\n    3)]\r\n\r\nMany years ago Al Look, of Grand Junction, discovered and excavated two\r\ncaves in the part of No Thoroughfare Canyon formerly outside the\r\nMonument. He found stone projectile points, knives, awls, milling\r\nstones, parts of a sandal and coiled basket, reed matting, corn,\r\ncorncobs, acorns, and animal bones, but no pottery—indicating that the\r\npeople had not progressed beyond basket making. Similar artifacts were\r\nfound in several other nearby places on the Uncompahgre Plateau.\r\nArchaeologists have named this old culture the Uncompahgre Complex, and\r\ndate it back to a few thousand years before the time of Christ.[9] It\r\nshould be pointed out that it is unlawful to remove artifacts, fossils,\r\nrocks, or minerals from a National Park or Monument.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1963 an archaeological survey of Colorado National\r\nMonument was carried out, under the terms of an agreement between the\r\nNational Park Service and the University of Colorado, by Stroh and Ewing\r\nand their field assistants.[10] A total of 75 aboriginal sites were\r\nfound of which 71 were within the Monument boundaries of that date, and\r\n4 were closely adjacent. These comprised 41 open campsites, 24 rock\r\nshelters, 2 small caves, and 8 chipping stations. Artifacts recovered\r\nincluded 62 projectile points, 21 metates (grinding stones), 40 manos\r\n(hand stones), 111 whole or fragments of blades or scrapers, 6 choppers,\r\nseveral fragments of baskets, potsherds (bits of broken pottery) at two\r\nsites, 2 wood awls, several strands of yucca fibers, 3 corncobs, 6\r\nkernels of corn, several bone fragments, storage cists at five sites,\r\nand petroglyphs at three locations.\r\n\r\nStroh and Ewing concluded that the majority of the sites appear to have\r\nbeen the campsites of a hunting and gathering people, and they\r\nspeculated that there may have been aboriginal activity in the area from\r\nas long as several thousand years ago to relatively recent times.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the petroglyphs,[11] or rock drawings, are on a fallen\r\nslab of Wingate Sandstone in No Thoroughfare Canyon, and are shown in\r\nfigure 4. Archaeologist John Crouch (footnote 10), who kindly reexamined\r\nthese petroglyphs in February 1980, told me that most of the figures\r\nappear to be Shoshonian (Ute), but that some may be of the Fremont\r\nculture[12] or even older.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PETROGLYPHS, on fallen slab of Wingate Sandstone in\r\n    No Thoroughfare Canyon.

(Fig. 4)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Late Arrivals\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Early Settlement[13]\r\n\r\nPrior to 1881 the Monument area was inhabited only by Ute Indians, but\r\nit was visited from time to time by a few fur trappers, explorers, and\r\ngeologists. In 1776 an expedition led by Fathers Dominguez and Escalante\r\npassed northward across Grand Mesa, the high plateau just east of the\r\narea, which is pointed out in many of the photographs. A trading post\r\nwas built by Joseph Roubidoux about 1838 just above the present site of\r\nGrand Junction. In 1853 Captain John W. Gunnison, seeking a new route\r\nfor a transcontinental railroad, led an exploring party down what is now\r\nthe Gunnison River Valley, past the confluence with the Grand River (now\r\ncalled the Colorado, p. 16), and on down the valley. Geologists and\r\ntopographers of the Hayden Survey found only Ute Indians in the area in\r\n1875 and 1876, and their field season of 1875 was abruptly cut short\r\nbecause of skirmishes with hostile Utes. After the Meeker (Colorado)\r\nMassacre of 1879, believed by many to have been caused mainly by the\r\nignorance and shortsightedness of Meeker himself, treaties were signed\r\nforcing the Utes out of western Colorado onto reservations in eastern\r\nUtah, and the last of the Utes was reportedly out of the area by\r\nSeptember 1881. The Grand Valley was immediately opened to settlement,\r\nand the first ranch was staked out on September 7, 1881. Nineteen days\r\nlater George A. Crawford founded Grand Junction as a townsite and formed\r\nthe Grand Junction Town Company the next month. The success of the new\r\ntown was assured on November 21, 1882, when the narrow-gage line of the\r\nDenver and Rio Grande Railroad (now Denver and Rio Grande Western\r\nRailroad) reached it via the Gunnison River valley. The town of Fruita\r\nwas founded by William E. Pabor in 1883 and incorporated the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 The Brown-Stanton River Expedition[14]\r\n\r\nOf the many early expeditions down the Colorado River, only one went\r\npast what is now Colorado National Monument—the ill-fated Brown-Stanton\r\nexpedition. After the pioneering expeditions of 1869 and 1871 down the\r\nGreen and Colorado Rivers by Major John Wesley Powell and his men, the\r\nmany ensuing river expeditions started in Utah or Wyoming; but the first\r\nphase of the Brown-Stanton expedition started in Colorado—at Grand\r\nJunction. In 1889 Frank M. Brown organized a company for the\r\nconstruction of the proposed Denver, Colorado Canyon, and Pacific\r\nRailway, which was to carry coal from mines in Colorado over a\r\n“water-level” line through the mighty canyons of the Colorado River to\r\nthe Gulf of California some 1,200 miles away, from which coal would be\r\nshipped to various ports in California. On March 26, 1889, president\r\nBrown, chief engineer F. C. Kendricks, and assistant engineer T. P.\r\nRigney drove the first stake at Grand Junction for a survey of the new\r\nline. Then Brown left for the East to obtain financing, and the other\r\ntwo men plus some hired hands took off in a boat down the Grand River.\r\nAfter reaching the confluence, they towed the boat up the Green River to\r\nthe town of Green River, Utah, thus becoming the first to make this trip\r\nupstream, albeit on foot and dragging their boats. Brown, who had\r\nreturned from the East, his newly appointed chief engineer Robert\r\nBrewster Stanton, and 14 others in six ill-designed boats of cedar\r\nrather than oak, left Green River, Utah, on May 25, 1889. Against the\r\nadvice of Major Powell and others, they carried no life preservers.\r\nAfter many mishaps, Brown and two others were drowned near the head of\r\nMarble Canyon, and the ill-fated expedition temporarily ground to a\r\nhalt. However, the indefatigable Stanton had new boats built of oak, and\r\nwith a reorganized party of 12 left the mouth of the Dirty Devil River\r\non November 25. After many additional mishaps the party finally reached\r\nthe Gulf of California on April 26, 1890. In spite of Stanton’s heroic\r\nefforts, the railroad was never built, and the Grand Canyon was spared\r\nthe huffing and puffing of locomotives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Kodel’s Gold Mine[15]\r\n\r\nAs shown in figures 3, 8, and 26, the first major canyon west of the\r\nWest Entrance of the monument is called Kodels Canyon (pronounced\r\n\\‘kōd^ǝls\\). It was named after an early-day stonemason turned\r\nprospector, a hermit, who came to the Fruita area before 1900 and\r\nprospected for gold until at least 1930 in the canyon that now bears his\r\nname. He seemingly built a cabin or house near the mouth of the canyon,\r\nspent most of the rest of his life in a vain quest for gold in the\r\ncanyon, barricaded his house against would-be intruders, and took\r\npotshots at anyone approaching his home for fear they were after his\r\n“gold.” Some thought him only half crazy, but when he took repeated\r\nshots at an Indian named Henry Kadig, he was adjudged wholly insane and\r\nsent to the mental hospital at Pueblo, Colorado, for several years. When\r\nhe got out he sold the grazing rights in his canyon to the late Irving\r\nBeard of Fruita, and seemingly was not heard from again. According to\r\nvarious estimates, Kodel dug an adit between 18 and 150 feet into the\r\ndark Proterozoic rock in the side of the canyon (shown in fig. 3), then\r\nsunk a shaft somewhere between 30 and 50 feet deep. He was always “on\r\nthe verge of a big strike,” but there is no record of any actual\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nLater, a prospector from the midwest spent several summers digging in\r\nDevils Canyon, the next major canyon to the west, but he was equally\r\nunsuccessful. The unsuccessful attempts of Kodel and others is not\r\nsurprising, for the two canyons are some 100 miles north of the Colorado\r\nmineral belt—a band extending roughly from Boulder to the western part\r\nof the San Juan Mountains, in which ore-bearing Upper Cretaceous or\r\nlower Tertiary rocks were intruded into all overlying rocks of whatever\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Recent Cave Dweller\r\n\r\nAbout 3 miles west of the Glade Park Store and Post Office are three\r\nlarge caves in a cliff of the Wingate Sandstone on the north wall of a\r\ncanyon containing a tributary of Clark’s Wash. The middle cave, which\r\nformerly contained a small one-room framehouse and other improvements,\r\nwas occupied for about 40 years prior to 1958 by Mrs. Laura Hazel Miller\r\n(fig. 5). A large cave just to the west (left) was used for storage, and\r\nanother large cave just to the east formerly was fenced to shelter\r\ndomestic animals. Mrs. Miller lived alone most of this time but had a\r\ndog for companionship the last few years she lived in the cave. When my\r\nwife and I visited her in the mid-fifties we had a very pleasant\r\nconversation with this very intelligent woman and could hardly believe\r\nshe was 87 years old. She could not understand why anyone could live in\r\ncrowded cities as she much preferred the peace and quiet of her cave.\r\nOnce a week she walked the 6 miles round trip to and from the Glade Park\r\nStore and Post Office, bought what few necessities she needed, and\r\ntelephoned her daughter in Grand Junction. Maybe she had something the\r\nrest of us have missed! She became sick in her nineties and moved to\r\nGrand Junction to live with her daughter. After she died, the property\r\nwas sold, and I have since observed that vandals had burned her one room\r\nhouse and had destroyed most of the other improvements.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CAVE in Wingate Sandstone inhabited by Mrs. Laura\r\n    Hazel Miller (visible between gate posts) until 1958. One-room house\r\n    was entirely within cave, and smaller storehouses extended back of\r\n    the house. Note blackening of cave roof by soot. (Fig. 5)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Artesian Wells\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may surprise you to learn that several sandstone formations supply\r\nwater to artesian wells northeast of the Monument in The Redlands,\r\nOrchard Mesa, and the southwestern side of the Grand Valley, most of\r\nwhich are 500 to more than 1,000 feet deep. When first drilled and for\r\nsome years later these wells flowed at the land surface, but eventually\r\nafter too many wells had been drilled too close together, each well\r\nreduced the output of neighboring wells until most wells ceased to flow\r\nnaturally. This made it necessary for most well owners to install pumps,\r\nwhich further aggravated the problem by reducing the artesian head (the\r\nheight to which the water rises above the formation from which it\r\nissues). This created a situation not unlike too many children sucking\r\non straws in the same ice cream soda, and led to a detailed\r\ninvestigation by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Colorado Water\r\nConservation Board,[16] outgrowths of which were the present report and\r\nits predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe water system of the Ute Conservancy District was virtually completed\r\nby late 1964 and began to supply water to rural residents of Grand\r\nValley between the towns of Palisade and Mack through a vast network of\r\npipelines. The water is obtained from surface sources on the north flank\r\nof Grand Mesa east of the valley and is brought to the valley via a\r\npipeline down the valley of Plateau Creek. Use of the new water has\r\nreduced the draft on many of the artesian wells. The reduced draft has\r\nlocally arrested the decline in the artesian head or has actually\r\nallowed some recovery in head.\r\n\r\nIn order of their importance and productivity the water-bearing\r\nsandstones are the Entrada, the Wingate, and local sandstone lenses in\r\nthe lower part (Salt Wash Member) of the Morrison Formation (fig. 7). In\r\na few places small flows or yields are obtained from wells that tap the\r\nDakota Sandstone and underlying Burro Canyon Formation, but inasmuch as\r\nthe Dakota contains some marine sandstones from which all the salt\r\nseemingly has not yet been flushed out, the water from most of these\r\nwells is brackish or salty.\r\n\r\nAs we will see on the trip “From Grand Junction through The Redlands to\r\nthe West Entrance of the Monument,” pages 88-95, in and near the\r\nMonument these sandstones look bone dry, so how can they supply water to\r\nartesian wells? They are indeed dry in all the cliff exposures, but as\r\nwill be noted later when the bending and breaking of the rocks are\r\ndiscussed (p. 64-71), erosion has exposed the upturned sandstones so\r\nthat they may take in water from the many small streams that drain the\r\nMonument and adjacent areas for short periods after summer\r\nthundershowers or during spring thaws. The water moves slowly down the\r\ndipping sandstones and becomes trapped under pressure beneath overlying\r\nbeds of siltstone or mudstone—materials that are nearly impervious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Geographic Setting\r\n\r\n\r\nGeologists and geographers have divided the United States into many\r\nprovinces, each of which has distinctive geologic and topographic\r\ncharacteristics that set it apart from the others. Colorado National\r\nMonument is in the northeastern part of the Canyon Lands section of the\r\nColorado Plateau Province—a province that contains 15 national parks and\r\nmonuments, about 3 times as many as any other province. This province,\r\nhereinafter referred to simply as the Colorado Plateau, or the Plateau,\r\ncovers some 150,000 square miles and extends from Rifle, Colo., at the\r\nnortheast to a little beyond Flagstaff, Ariz., at the southwest, and\r\nfrom Cedar City, Utah, at the west nearly to Albuquerque, N. Mex., at\r\nthe southeast. This scenic province consists of high plateaus generally\r\nranging in altitude from 4,500 feet to more than 7,000 feet, which are\r\ndeeply and intricately dissected by literally thousands of canyons.\r\n\r\nColorado National Monument is drained entirely by the Colorado River,\r\nwhich flows to the northwest in the wide Grand Valley just a few miles\r\nfrom the northeastern border (fig. 3). The small streams that drain the\r\nMonument contain water only after summer thundershowers or after rapid\r\nsnowmelt.\r\n\r\nWhy is the large valley of the Colorado River called the Grand Valley?\r\nThe Colorado River northeast from its confluence with the Green River in\r\nthe middle of Canyonlands National Park[17] formerly was called the\r\nGrand River, and the Green and Grand joined at the confluence to form\r\nthe Colorado River. The Grand River was renamed Colorado River by act of\r\nthe Colorado State Legislature approved March 24, 1921, and approved by\r\nact of Congress July 25, 1921. But the old term still remains in names\r\nsuch as Grand County, Colo., the headwaters region; Grand Valley, a town\r\n16 miles west of Rifle, Colo.; Grand Valley between Palisade and Mack,\r\nColo.; Grand Mesa, an extensive plateau which towers more than a mile\r\nabove the Grand and Gunnison River Valleys; Grand Junction, Colo., a\r\ncity appropriately situated at the confluence of the Grand and Gunnison\r\nRivers; and Grand County, Utah, which the river traverses after entering\r\nUtah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Geologic Story Begins\r\n\r\n\r\nColorado National Monument is a land of brightly colored cliff-walled\r\ncanyons and towering monoliths—a majestic sample of mysterious\r\ncanyonlands that stretch hundreds of miles to the west and south. Now a\r\ndesert region more than a mile above the sea, it was not always so. More\r\nthan a billion years ago the site of the Monument was deep beneath the\r\nsea. Later, lofty mountains were pushed up only to be obliterated\r\neventually by the slow but relentless forces of erosion. Millions of\r\nyears later the earth shook to the stride of 10-ton dinosaurs—then the\r\nsea returned again and sharks swam over the region looking for food.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few samples of the interesting—even exciting—events in\r\nthe long geologic history of the Monument. Many pages, indeed several\r\nwhole chapters, of its history are missing and must be inferred from\r\nnearby regions where the story is more complete. Thus, the cliffs and\r\ncanyons you are looking at did not get that way overnight. An\r\nunderstanding of the geologic processes and events that led to the\r\nscenic features of today should help you toward a clearer picture and\r\ngreater appreciation of nature’s handiworks (fig. 6).\r\n\r\nGeologists recognize rocks of three distinctly different modes of\r\norigin—sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic, and there are many\r\nvariations of each type. The sedimentary rocks of the Monument are\r\ncomposed of clay, silt, sand, and gravel carried and deposited by moving\r\nwater; silt and fine sand transported by wind; and some limestone,\r\ncomposed mainly of the mineral calcium carbonate, which was precipitated\r\nfrom water solutions in freshwater lakes. In areas not far to the\r\nnortheast and southwest are many sedimentary rocks of marine origin,\r\nthat is, materials that were deposited in the ocean or shallow inland\r\nseas, but in the Monument marine sedimentary rocks occur only in parts\r\nof the Dakota Sandstone; however, the overlying marine Mancos Shale\r\nunderlies the adjacent Grand Valley and forms the lower slopes of the\r\nBook Cliffs across the valley (fig. 25).\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks were solidified from liquid molten rock intruded upward\r\ninto any preexisting rocks along cracks, joints, and faults. Molten rock\r\nthat reaches the land surface and forms volcanos or lava flows is called\r\nextrusive igneous rock. Joints are cracks or breaks in rocks along which\r\nno movement has taken place. Faults are cracks or joints along which one\r\nside has moved relative to the other. Different types of faults are\r\nshown in figure 28. Metamorphic rocks were formed from either of the\r\nother types by great heat and pressure at extreme depths in the Earth’s\r\ncrust. Metamorphic rocks and some intrusive igneous rocks make up the\r\nhard, dark rock that floors all the deep canyons in and near the\r\nMonument. The nearest extrusive igneous rocks are the thick, dark lava\r\nflows that cap towering Grand Mesa to the east and Battlement Mesa to\r\nthe northeast.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INDEPENDENCE MONUMENT, separating the two entrances\r\n    of Monument Canyon.

Some\r\nof these minerals precipitated from solution and cemented the loose\r\nparticles into rocks of varying hardness. Thus, most of the sandstones\r\nare partly cemented with the mineral calcite, composed of calcium\r\ncarbonate (CaCO₃), but some are cemented also with silica (SiO₂) or\r\nhematite (Fe₂O₃).\r\n\r\nLook almost anywhere in the Monument and you will see that the rocks are\r\npiled up in layers of different color, thickness, and hardness—much like\r\na vast layer cake. In most of the Monument, these layers are flat or\r\nslope gently down to the northeast, but along the northeastern boundary\r\nthey are sharply bent or broken as though the cake had been carelessly\r\nplaced over the edge of a table and had sagged.\r\n\r\nLet us consider these layers one by one, beginning with the oldest at\r\nthe bottom, for each is a partial record of events long past. Layers of\r\nrock that can be easily recognized and distinguished from other layers\r\nare called formations and are named after a place where they are well\r\nexposed. For the name to be accepted for general usage it must be the\r\nfirst published description in a technical report of a particular\r\nsequence of rock layers. The places after which the formations of the\r\nMonument were named are given in the rock column (fig. 7), and the\r\noutcrops of the formations are shown on the geologic map (fig. 8). In\r\nthe pages that follow, the geologic events that shaped the Monument we\r\nsee today are discussed in chronological order, beginning with the\r\noldest rocks that floor the deep canyons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GEOLOGIC MAP of Colorado National Monument and\r\n    vicinity, simplified and greatly reduced from part of maps at scale\r\n    1:31,680 by Lohman (1963, 1965a).

Most were once sand and mud that spread out on the bottom of\r\nthe sea and later hardened into sedimentary rocks (fig. 9-1). After\r\nthousands of feet of such rocks had accumulated, they were squeezed,\r\nbent, and lifted up by slow but mighty movements of the Earth’s crust to\r\nform high mountains perhaps like the Rockies. Heat and pressure that\r\ndeveloped at great depth in the roots of these mountains changed the\r\nsediments into metamorphic rocks known as schist (finely banded) and\r\ngneiss (coarsely banded) (fig. 9-2). The rocks are about 1½ billion\r\nyears old (fig. 7).\r\n\r\nLater in Proterozoic time, about a billion years ago, molten material\r\nfrom below was forced upward along cracks or faults and cooled slowly to\r\nform thin seams or dikes and irregular bodies of granite (fig. 9-3).\r\nDikes are called pegmatite when they contain large crystals of pink\r\nfeldspar, white or clear quartz, black tourmaline, and large flakes of\r\nwhite mica. Small pegmatite dikes that pass through the older schist and\r\ngneiss may be seen along roadcuts in Fruita and No Thoroughfare Canyons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BLOCK DIAGRAMS OF EARLY PROTEROZOIC EVENTS (after\r\n    Edwin D. McKee).

Heat and pressure at great depth changed the\r\n    sediments into banded schist and gneiss.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ③ Molten rock flowed upward along cracks or faults.\r\n    Upon cooling it formed lava at the surface and granite or pegmatite\r\n    beneath.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ④ During eons of time the forces of erosion wore down\r\n    the mountains to a nearly level plain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     A Great Gap in the Rock Record\r\n\r\nIf you look down into any of the large canyons in the Monument, you will\r\nnotice a brick-red formation, the Chinle, which forms steep slopes at\r\nthe foot of the high cliffs and lies upon the dark Proterozoic rocks\r\nalong nearly straight lines of contact. Such a straight-line contact is\r\nparticularly well shown about midway up the high bluffs along the\r\nnortheastern boundary of the Monument (fig. 37). If the red layer and\r\nall overlying rocks were stripped away, these straight lines would be\r\nthe exposed edges of a remarkably smooth, nearly flat erosion surface on\r\nthe top of the dark Proterozoic rocks, as shown in the last diagram of\r\nfigure 9. A vast amount of time passed between the carving of this\r\nsurface and the deposition of the red Chinle, and no record of the\r\nevents during this time is preserved in the Monument.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the Proterozoic Eon and parts of the long\r\nPaleozoic Era that followed, the dark rocks were submerged beneath the\r\nsea several times and received sediments now found in areas to the\r\nnortheast and southwest. Beginning in the Pennsylvanian Period some 330\r\nmillion years ago (fig. 61), a large upfold of the rocks, or anticline\r\n(fig. 27), known to geologists as the Uncompahgre Highland, rose high\r\nabove sea level, probably reaching its highest level in Late\r\nPennsylvanian or Permian time. This old highland formed an imposing\r\nchain of mountains in about the position of the present Uncompahgre\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nAfter the old rocks were pushed up into these high mountains what became\r\nof them? From the moment the mountains began to rise, their rocks were\r\nbuffeted by wind, pounded by rain, pried open by frost, scoured by\r\ndebris-laden streams and, perhaps by glaciers, and the loosened rock\r\nparticles were dissolved or carried to the sea. Most rocks are brittle\r\nenough to crack when bent by Earth forces. Such cracks, called joints,\r\nare easy targets for erosion. The freezing of water in joints tends to\r\npry the rocks apart. The breakup of the rocks was hastened by the\r\nchemical attack on rock minerals by water charged with oxygen and carbon\r\ndioxide. When land plants became established in later geologic eras,\r\nsoil acids formed from decaying vegetation also assisted materially in\r\nbreaking up the rocks.\r\n\r\nThese same erosion processes are going on today, but their effects are\r\nscarcely noticeable from year to year except in soft earth after storms\r\nor floods. During eons of time, however, the mountains were again worn\r\ndown to a nearly level plain. Missing between the red Chinle and the\r\ndark rocks are many thousands of feet of rocks, some of which once\r\ncovered this surface and still occur in other regions less affected by\r\nerosion. This gap in the rock record, which represents more than a\r\nbillion years, is known to geologists as a great unconformity. Missing\r\nare part of the lower Proterozoic rocks, all the upper Proterozoic\r\nrocks, all those of the Paleozoic Era, and part of those of the Triassic\r\nPeriod of the Mesozoic Era. (See figs. 7 and 61.)\r\n\r\nTraces of primitive life have been found in some Proterozoic rocks in\r\nthe form of lime-secreting algae and casts of worms, but no fossils of\r\nmore advanced types have been found because at that time the primitive\r\nanimals seemingly had not yet developed shells or skeletons. The ensuing\r\nPaleozoic Era saw the appearance and great development of shellfish,\r\nfish, amphibians, reptiles, and primitive plants. Some of the rock\r\nlayers of ages missing at the Monument may be seen as near as Glenwood\r\nSprings to the northeast and Gateway to the southwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Age of Reptiles\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the layers of sedimentary rocks preserved in the Monument above the\r\ndark Proterozoic ones were deposited by wind and water during the\r\nMesozoic Era. This long era has been called the age of reptiles, for\r\nreptiles, including dinosaurs (meaning terrible lizards), were then the\r\ndominant land animals. The Mesozoic Era has been divided into three\r\nparts—the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous Periods. Rocks of each of\r\nthese periods crop out in the Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Early Landscape\r\n\r\nBy late Triassic time the Monument was part of a nearly flat plain cut\r\non the dark Proterozoic rocks, but there were hills or low mountains to\r\nthe northeast. Streams from these hills dropped mud, silt, sand, and\r\nsome gravel on this plain and into many small lakes that occupied the\r\ngentle depressions. Later, these deposits hardened mainly into red\r\nsiltstone and sandstone, but thin beds of gravel were cemented to form\r\nconglomerate, and thin beds of limestone formed in some of the shallow\r\nlakes by the precipitation of the mineral calcium carbonate. These\r\nrocks, which comprise the Chinle (pronounced Chin-lee) Formation, are\r\nonly 80 to 100 feet thick in the Monument but are as much as 700 feet\r\nthick near Moab, Utah, southwest of the Uncompahgre Plateau, where the\r\nentire formation is present. There, the Chinle rests on still older\r\nTriassic and Paleozoic rocks—all absent in the Monument for the reasons\r\nnoted previously. In some parts of the Plateau, sandstone or\r\nconglomerate beds in the lower part of the Chinle yield uranium ore, but\r\nthese beds were not deposited in or near the Monument.\r\n\r\nThe red color of the Chinle and some of the overlying rocks is caused by\r\nminute amounts of iron oxide—the same pigment used in rouge and red barn\r\npaint. Various oxides of iron, some including water, produce not only\r\nbrick red but also pink, salmon, brown, buff, yellow, and even green or\r\nbluish green. This does not imply that the rocks could be considered as\r\nsources of iron ore, for the merest trace of iron, generally only 1 to 3\r\npercent, is enough to produce even the darkest shades of red.\r\n\r\nBecause it is soft, the Chinle is easily eroded into steep slopes at the\r\nfoot of high sandstone cliffs in all canyons of the Monument and on top\r\nof the high bluffs that face The Redlands. It also forms the broad base\r\nof Independence Monument. Rim Rock Drive crosses the Chinle three times\r\nin the lower part of Fruita Canyon and twice in No Thoroughfare Canyon.\r\n\r\nFossil reptile bones, petrified wood, and freshwater shells come from\r\nthe Chinle in parts of Arizona and Utah. Reptiles probably roamed the\r\nMonument in Chinle time, but their remains have not been located.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Ancient Sand Dunes\r\n\r\nStill later in the Triassic Period the Monument became part of a vast\r\ndesert. Winds blowing from the northwest brought great quantities of\r\nfine sand and piled them up into large dunes like those in the Sahara or\r\nin Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado. But like all deserts,\r\nit was not always dry—occasional rainstorms produced many small lakes\r\nand ponds. Some of the sand was washed into these lakes or ponds and\r\nsettled in level layers. This huge sandpile eventually hardened into the\r\nbuff and light-red sandstone that we now know as the Wingate. The shapes\r\nof the old dunes are indicated by the steep dips of sand layers, called\r\ncrossbeds, which stand out in sharp contrast to the nearly level layers\r\nformed in the lakes and ponds (fig. 10).\r\n\r\nThe spectacular scenery of Colorado National Monument owes its existence\r\nlargely to the 350-foot cliffs of the Wingate Sandstone (fig. 6) and to\r\nthe desert climate, which allows us to see virtually every foot of the\r\nvividly colored rocks and has made possible the creation and\r\npreservation of such a wide variety of fantastic sculptures. A wetter\r\nclimate would have produced a far different and smoother landscape in\r\nwhich most of the rocks and land forms would have been hidden by\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nEroded remnants of the Wingate form most of the named rock features of\r\nthe Monument and are shown in many of the photographs. Independence\r\nMonument—a towering slab of sandstone that resembles a bridge pier (fig.\r\n6)—is all that is left of a high narrow wall that once connected the\r\npoint east of Independence View with the high mesa north of the slab and\r\nwhich once separated the two entrances of Monument Canyon. In a few\r\nthousand years this remnant, too, may be gone.\r\n\r\nVertical cliffs and shafts of the Wingate Sandstone endure only where\r\nthe top of the formation is capped by beds of the next younger rock\r\nunit—the Kayenta Formation. The Kayenta is much more resistant to\r\nerosion than the Wingate, so even a few feet of the Kayenta, such as the\r\ncap on top of Independence Monument, protect the rock beneath. Once this\r\ncap has been eroded away, the underlying Wingate weathers into rounded\r\ndomes, such as the Coke Ovens.\r\n\r\nCold Shivers Point (fig. 53)—a toadstool shaped cap of sandstone of the\r\nKayenta above a vertical cliff of the Wingate—is perhaps the most aptly\r\ntitled feature of the Monument.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PETRIFIED SAND DUNES in Wingate Sandstone along old\r\n    Serpents Trail. Looking north across The Redlands and Grand Valley\r\n    to the Book Cliffs. Battlement Mesa on right skyline. (Fig. 10)]\r\n\r\nThe Coke Ovens (fig. 11) and Squaw Fingers were formed partly because\r\nmost of the caprock of Kayenta has been weathered away and also because\r\nthe brittle rocks were cracked along an evenly spaced set of vertical\r\njoints. These joints trend northward between the two named features.\r\nMore rapid weathering along these joints helped form the separate\r\nrounded domes or spires between them. Similarly, northwestward-trending\r\nvertical joints connect and helped shape Kissing Couple, Pipe Organ, and\r\nSentinal Spire.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE COKE OVENS, looking north from overlook beneath\r\n    Artists Point. A set of north-south joints has allowed erosion of\r\n    the Wingate Sandstone to proceed more rapidly along these zones of\r\n    weakness and has helped create the four ovens shown. Weathering away\r\n    of the protective caprock of the overlying Kayenta Formation has\r\n    produced rounded tops on all but the left-hand shaft, which is still\r\n    protected by the Kayenta. Note alcoves and arches in cliff of the\r\n    Wingate beyond, the formation of the one on the right having been\r\n    aided by removal of the underlying soft Chinle Formation. Bench\r\n    covered by piñon and juniper above Wingate is resistant thin-bedded\r\n    Kayenta Formation. Cliff above the bench is the Slick Rock Member of\r\n    the Entrada Sandstone. The Coke Ovens were named from their\r\n    resemblance to the beehive-shaped brick ovens formerly used to\r\n    convert bituminous coal into coke for smelting iron. (Fig. 11)]\r\n\r\nMany of the cliff walls of the Wingate are vertical, some even overhang,\r\nyet in some places the slopes are gentle enough to hold talus and to be\r\nclimbed (fig. 12). Why is this? The answer to this question is given in\r\na later section on “Canyon Cutting.”\r\n\r\nArches or shallow caves weathered out of some cliff faces of the\r\nWingate, particularly where the underlying Chinle Formation has been\r\npartly scoured away. Although there are no large caves within the\r\nMonument, there are three in a row along the road 3 miles west of the\r\nGlade Park Post Office. One of these was inhabited until 1958 (fig. 5).\r\n\r\nMany of the cliff faces of the Wingate are darkened or blackened by\r\ndesert varnish—a natural pigment of iron and manganese oxides, silica,\r\nand clay.[19]\r\n\r\nDinosaurs left their footprints in the sands of the Wingate in parts of\r\nthe Colorado Plateau, but no tracks or fossils have yet been found in\r\nthis formation in or near the Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Rains Came\r\n\r\nThe arid climate of Wingate time was followed by a wet period, when\r\nstreams from the northeast gradually covered the sand dunes with mud,\r\nsand, and some gravel. The sand and gravel of the stream channels were\r\ncemented into hard sandstone and conglomerate, and the mud of the flood\r\nplains hardened into red and purple siltstone and mudstone. The\r\nresulting Kayenta Formation makes up the bench between the two cliffs\r\nupon which the Visitor Center, campgrounds, and most of scenic Rim Rock\r\nDrive were built. Here, nature was kind, for this gently sloping bench\r\nwas an ideal place to build the road from which to look down into the\r\ndeep chasms. The Kayenta also caps the broad mesas between the canyons.\r\nIt is about 350 feet thick in eastern Utah, only 45 to 80 feet thick in\r\nthe Monument, and it is absent altogether not far east of the Monument.\r\nThe reasons for the eastward thinning and ultimate disappearance of the\r\nKayenta and some younger rocks are given in the next section.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RED CANYON, looking northeast toward Grand Junction\r\n    from Red Canyon Overlook.

Rim Rock Drive is on bench of the\r\n    Kayenta close to thinner cliff of Entrada Sandstone in background.\r\n    Looking northwest from a point northeast of Monument Canyon View.\r\n    (Fig. 13)]\r\n\r\nAs noted earlier, the sandstone beds and lenses of the Kayenta generally\r\nare coarser grained (some even contain small pebbles) and much harder\r\nthan the underlying Wingate Sandstone—particularly the lower beds of the\r\nKayenta, which serve as a protective capping, as shown in figure 13 and\r\nin many of the other photographs. Unlike the dominantly fine grained,\r\nwell sorted, windblown sands of the Wingate, the coarser stream-laid\r\nsands of the Kayenta are angular and poorly sorted, so that small grains\r\nfill spaces between larger ones. Moreover, in addition to the calcite\r\ncement (which also holds together the sand grains in the Wingate and\r\nEntrada Sandstones), most of the sand grains and pebbles in the Kayenta\r\nare covered by interconnected “overgrowths” of silica (SiO₂), which make\r\nup about 10 percent of the rocks and serve as a nearly insoluble hard\r\ncement.[20]\r\n\r\nThe combination of the coarse and fine grains and interlocking silica\r\n“overgrowths” makes the Kayenta one of the most resistant rocks in the\r\nColorado Plateau.\r\n\r\nIn distant views of weathered outcrops the Kayenta appears to consist\r\nmainly of thin beds or lenses of sandstone, which indeed it does, but in\r\nsome fresh exposures, such as roadcuts, the highly lenticular red\r\nflood-plain deposits form striking features which may wedge out from 3\r\nor 4 feet thick to a featheredge within horizontal distances of only a\r\nfew feet (fig. 14).\r\n\r\nThe Kayenta has yielded fossil bones of dinosaurs and other reptiles in\r\nnortheastern Arizona and freshwater shells in eastern Utah. As yet,\r\nhowever, no fossils have been reported from it in or near the Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Another Gap in the Rock Record\r\n\r\nFollowing the wet interval when the Kayenta Formation was deposited over\r\nwide areas of the Colorado Plateau by streams, the Plateau once again\r\nbecame a vast desert, and this time the dry climate persisted from the\r\nLate Triassic into the Jurassic. The howling winds piled up enormous\r\nsand dunes, layer upon layer, to a total thickness of more than 2,200\r\nfeet at Zion National Park, and as much as 500 feet remains in eastern\r\nUtah and parts of southwestern Colorado. This immense sandpile\r\neventually was cemented by calcite into the Navajo Sandstone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: KAYENTA FORMATION, showing lenses of hard channel\r\n    sandstones and wedge of red siltstone and mudstone. Along road cut\r\n    of Rim Rock Drive near head of main stem of Ute Canyon. Vertical\r\n    grooves remain from drill holes used in blasting roadcut. (Fig. 14)]\r\n\r\nBeautifully sculptured remains of the Navajo are featured attractions at\r\nZion, Capitol Reef, and Arches National Parks, Rainbow Bridge, Navajo,\r\nand Dinosaur National Monuments; border many miles of beautiful Lake\r\nPowell; and form the eastern flank of the San Rafael Swell. For reasons\r\nto be explained, this sandstone thins to the northeast, and is absent\r\nentirely at about the Utah-Colorado State line, some 35 miles southwest\r\nof the Monument. Thus, in the Monument, the Navajo, most of the Kayenta,\r\nand the lower part of the Entrada Sandstone are missing at another gap\r\nin the rock record, as shown in figure 15.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GAP IN THE ROCK RECORD, between Kayenta Formation\r\n    below 3½- × 6-inch green notebook and Slick Rock Member of Entrada\r\n    Sandstone above. The reasons for this gap are given in the text on\r\n    page 38. That this is an erosional unconformity is clearly indicated\r\n    by the uneven top of the Kayenta, particularly to the left of the\r\n    notebook. Note solution pits and openings in the Entrada near top of\r\n    photograph. (Fig. 15)]\r\n\r\nHow is it possible that the Navajo Sandstone is more than 2,200 feet\r\nthick in Zion National Park, is several hundred feet thick in much of\r\nthe Plateau in Utah and parts of southwestern Colorado, yet is absent\r\nentirely, together with a considerable thickness of younger rocks in and\r\nnear Colorado National Monument? How much of the missing strata once\r\nwere present in the Monument is not known, but it seems clear that at\r\nleast part was present but was eroded away before the Entrada Sandstone\r\nwas deposited. There is evidence[21] that following the deposition and\r\nconsolidation of the Navajo Sandstone the Plateau and adjacent areas\r\nwere uplifted, tilted gently westward, and eroded for a considerable\r\nperiod of time. Erosion naturally was most pronounced in the eastern\r\nareas, including the Monument, where the uplift was greatest. Thus, in\r\nthe northeastern part of the Plateau all the Navajo and most of the\r\nKayenta were eroded away, and erosion continued there while the lowest\r\nmember of the Entrada, the Dewey Bridge Member, and the lower part of\r\nthe overlying Slick Rock Member were being laid down in the Moab, Utah,\r\narea.[22] This old erosion surface is clearly visible in many places\r\nalong the cliff wall on the southwest side of Rim Rock Drive between the\r\nVisitor Center and Kissing Couple.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in thickness of the Navajo Sandstone from southwest to\r\nnortheast and absence of the Navajo and some younger rocks in and near\r\nthe Monument are shown on an isometric (three dimensional) block diagram\r\nprepared by artist John R. Stacy and me, which is displayed in the\r\nMuseum of the Visitor Center. This block diagram portrays the surface\r\nand subsurface rocks from Zion National Park, Utah, to Black Canyon of\r\nthe Gunnison National Monument, Colo., via Capitol Reef National Park,\r\nthe Henry Mountains, and Colorado National Monument. Throughout the\r\nPlateau and parts of adjacent areas, the erosion surface on top of the\r\nNavajo Sandstone is covered by scattered pebbles of chert—a hard variety\r\nof silica (SiO₂) derived from cherty beds of freshwater limestone in the\r\nNavajo.[23] Where the Navajo has been completely eroded away and the\r\nancient erosion surface is on the Kayenta Formation, as in Colorado\r\nNational Monument, scattered pebbles (some of which are chert) derived\r\nfrom the conglomerate lenses in the Kayenta are found locally on the old\r\nsurface.[24]\r\n\r\nBecause of this gap in the rock record we will continue part of our\r\nstory farther west, where the rock record is more nearly complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Sea to the West\r\n\r\nIn Middle Jurassic time the land now called central Utah, which then was\r\nthe eroded surface of the Navajo Sandstone, sank beneath an arm of a\r\nshallow sea that came in from the north, and most of the area remained\r\nbeneath this sea until Late Jurassic time. Sediment carried into this\r\nsea and into bordering lagoons and estuaries later hardened into the\r\nsedimentary rocks of the Carmel Formation, Entrada Sandstone, and Curtis\r\nand Summerville Formations. The Carmel and Curtis contain abundant\r\nmarine fossils of Middle Jurassic age, and in central Utah the\r\nintervening unfossiliferous Entrada also is believed to have been\r\ndeposited in or near the sea, and the unfossiliferous Summerville\r\nFormation probably was deposited upon a tidal flat that was submerged\r\npart of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Deposits and Events East of the Sea\r\n\r\nIn eastern Utah, east of the ancient Jurassic sea, the Entrada Sandstone\r\nis entirely unfossiliferous, was partly water laid and partly wind\r\nblown, and has been divided into three distinctive parts, which in\r\nascending order are the Dewey Bridge, Slick Rock, and Moab Members.[25]\r\nIn and near the Colorado National Monument, the long period of erosion\r\ndiscussed in a preceding section probably continued well into the\r\nJurassic, so only the upper part of the Slick Rock Member and the\r\noverlying Moab Member were deposited on the eroded surface of what\r\nlittle remained of the Kayenta Formation (fig. 14).\r\n\r\nThe Slick Rock Member was named from its occurrence at and near the\r\nmining town of Slick Rock, Colo., which originally was named after the\r\nappearance of the rock because it generally forms slick, smooth cliffs.\r\nIt reminds one of the chicken and egg conundrum. The Slick Rock is\r\ncomposed mainly of sand dunes that were piled up on the eastern shore of\r\nthe Jurassic sea by winds blowing from the northeast. Occasional rainy\r\nspells created lakes and ponds in which some of the sand was laid down\r\nin level beds. This pile of sand later hardened into the cliff-forming\r\nSlick Rock Member, which looks something like the Wingate but is\r\ngenerally only half as thick, weathers into less abrupt cliffs, is\r\nmostly salmon red, and is almost free of joints. The joints in the\r\nWingate (fig. 11) probably resulted from the uplift and tilting of the\r\nPlateau before the long period of pre-Entrada erosion; whereas the land\r\nseems to have been more stable during Entrada time. The Slick Rock is\r\ncemented with calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), which is soluble even in weak\r\nacid, such as rain or snow water containing dissolved carbon dioxide.\r\nFor this reason solution openings or pits occur in some of the cliff\r\nfaces, the most striking of which are those shown near the top of figure\r\n15.\r\n\r\nThe Slick Rock Member of the Entrada Sandstone forms a line of cliffs\r\nand isolated monoliths that are second in height and grandeur only to\r\nthose of the Wingate. The Member is best displayed southwest of Rim Rock\r\nDrive between the Visitor Center and the Coke Ovens and along the\r\nwestern arm of Ute Canyon (fig. 16). It also forms the Saddlehorn just\r\nsouth of the camp and picnic grounds near the Visitor Center (fig. 50).\r\nMost of the smooth cliff faces show both the steeply dipping crossbeds\r\nof the old sand dunes and the flat-lying beds of the lake or pond\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ENTRADA SANDSTONE, just above normally dry waterfall\r\n    in west arm of Ute Canyon. Note smooth unjointed cliff of Slick Rock\r\n    Member protected at left by overhanging basal bed of Moab Member,\r\n    which forms about lower half of slope in distance. Upper part of\r\n    distant slope is the Summerville Formation overlain by Salt Wash\r\n    Member of the Morrison Formation. Note Slick Rock at left resting\r\n    upon eroded crossbedded sandstone in Kayenta Formation, in which the\r\n    canyon was cut. (Fig. 16)]\r\n\r\nThe overlying Moab Member of the Entrada is a white level-bedded\r\nsandstone that generally weathers into stairsteps or ledges. One of the\r\nbest exposures of the Moab Member is shown in figure 17, but good\r\nexposures also are seen along the west side of Rim Rock Drive just\r\nnortheast of the Coke Ovens Overlook. In some places the Moab Member\r\nforms cliffs continuous with those of the underlying Slick Rock Member.\r\nIt appears to consist of hardened beach or lagoon sand that was\r\ndeposited along the eastern shore of the sea, which suggests that the\r\nsea extended farther east during Moab and Summerville times than it did\r\nduring Dewey Bridge and Slick Rock times. Like the Slick Rock, the Moab\r\nalso is cemented by calcium carbonate, but the lower sandstone ledges of\r\nthe Moab Member are more resistant to erosion than the Slick Rock\r\nMember, so the Moab helps preserve the underlying cliffs. The top of the\r\nMoab Member forms patches of bare pavement east of the Monument, known\r\nas the “Slick Rim,” which may be observed from the Little Park Road.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOAB MEMBER OF ENTRADA SANDSTONE, showing typical\r\n    steplike weathering. In west arm of Ute Canyon about a quarter mile\r\n    above the view shown in figure 16. Moab Member caps and protects\r\n    overhang of Slick Rock Member. Moab is overlain by unexposed slope\r\n    of Summerville Formation and lower part of Morrison Formation. (Fig.\r\n    17)]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Slick Rock Member normally is salmon colored or pink, the\r\nupper half of an outcrop just north of the highest point on Rim Rock\r\nDrive at the head of main Ute Canyon has a distinctly mottled\r\nappearance, wherein much of the color has been leached to white, but\r\nirregular splotches of color appear in the dominantly white upper part,\r\nand white splotches appear in the colored part, as shown in figure 18.\r\nBy way of contrast, in an outcrop of the two members of the Entrada\r\nabout 2 miles north of the Glade Park Store and Post Office (fig. 19),\r\nthe entire Slick Rock Member is as white as the Moab Member, and the\r\nformer is white for some distance to the east. Why is the salmon color\r\nentirely missing from the Slick Rock near Glade Park, partly missing in\r\nfigure 18, but present virtually everywhere else in and near the\r\nMonument? The answers to this seeming mystery involve events that\r\noccurred long ago, so only the high points will be touched upon here.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOTTLED SALMON-AND-WHITE SLICK ROCK MEMBER, overlain\r\n    by white level-bedded Moab Member, on west side of Rim Rock Drive\r\n    about four-tenths of a mile north of head of main Ute Canyon. (Fig.\r\n    18)]\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable to suppose that the Slick Rock Member at both\r\nlocalities originally was salmon colored or pink, as it is everywhere\r\nelse, but that later, the coloring agent, red ferric iron oxide (Fe₂O₃),\r\nwas chemically reduced, or leached to ferrous iron oxide (FeO), by\r\nacidic ground water, and was carried away to the northeast by the slowly\r\nmoving ground water. But as I have already pointed out, the cliff\r\nexposures of the sandstones are now bone dry, so what happened to the\r\nground water and why was it acidic here and not elsewhere?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WHITE ENTRADA SANDSTONE, in outcrop just east of\r\n    gravel road about 2 miles north of Glade Park Store and Post Office.\r\n    Reasons for absence of salmon color in Slick Rock Member are given\r\n    in text. (Fig. 19)]\r\n\r\nBefore the cutting of the deep canyons of the Monument, which followed\r\nthe last major uplifts of the region accompanied by bending and breaking\r\nof the rocks, the now dry sandstones were saturated with ground water\r\nthat moved very slowly northeastward. Somewhere to the southwest the\r\nEntrada Sandstone seemingly took in water containing dissolved hydrogen\r\nsulfide gas (H₂S), changing the ground water to a weak acid. The H₂S\r\ncould have been produced by a type of anaerobic bacteria that has the\r\nability to reduce dissolved sulfates (SO₄⁻²) in water to the dissolved\r\nhydrogen sulfide gas, thereby obtaining needed oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe next questions you might logically ask are (1) if the above\r\ndeductions have any merit, how do we know the acid water was caused by\r\ndissolved hydrogen sulfide,[26] (2) what is the source of the sulfate\r\nions (SO₄⁻²) from which the H₂S was obtained, and (3) why is the color\r\nof the Slick Rock Member in figure 19 completely reduced to white\r\nwhereas that in figure 18 is only partly reduced in the upper part?\r\n\r\nAlthough the ground waters from artesian wells in the Grand Junction\r\narea contain small amounts of sulfate as do most ground waters, the\r\namount needed for the results observed more likely came from solution of\r\nthe common mineral gypsum (calcium sulfate containing some water,\r\nCaSO₄·2H₂O). The overlying Summerville and Morrison Formations contain\r\nsome gypsum in many places in Utah, so it is not improbable that these\r\nformations contain gypsum locally in Colorado. If so, sulfate-bearing\r\nwater could have percolated downward into the Entrada at some point\r\nsouthwest of Glade Park. But as this must have happened several million\r\nyears ago, the clues as to just where this occurred have grown quite\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nSeemingly, the color in the Slick Rock Member near and east of Glade\r\nPark was entirely removed by the process described, but the very slow\r\nmoving ground water had time to leach only the upper part of the Slick\r\nRock (the most permeable part) in Ute Canyon before the process was\r\nhalted forever by the draining of water from these beds by canyon\r\ncutting.\r\n\r\nShortly before the Jurassic sea to the west dried up, silt, mud, and\r\nsome sand were carried into either a shallow arm of the sea or a broad\r\nbay or lagoon near it, and later the silt, mud, and sand hardened to\r\nbecome the Summerville Formation. The Summerville is only 40 to 60 feet\r\nthick in the Monument but is much thicker in Utah.\r\n\r\nThe Summerville Formation is so soft that it weathers very rapidly and\r\nhence is exposed at only a few places. It is best displayed in the high\r\nroadcut at Artists Point and along the road to the south for the next\r\nmile (fig. 20), but it is also exposed in roadcuts along the west arm of\r\nUte Canyon. Even the thinnest beds of the Summerville can be traced for\r\nhundreds of yards, and individual beds have a nearly constant thickness\r\nfor such distances. This greatly facilitated the detailed measurement of\r\na section of the Summerville[27] by my son Bill and me from Artists\r\nPoint to the base of the overlying Morrison Formation about a mile\r\nsouth. Using a 6-foot folding steel rule we measured and described each\r\nthin bed from some key bed at about ground level to one at eye level,\r\nfollowed the upper key bed southward to ground level, then repeated the\r\nprocess until the entire 54 feet had been measured and described.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SUMMERVILLE FORMATION, at Artists Point (fig. 3).\r\n    Base of formation rests upon Moab Member of Entrada just beneath the\r\n    pavement. Note geologist’s pick resting upon lower ledge of\r\n    sandstone just to the left of middle. Top of the Summerville here\r\n    has been removed by erosion. (Fig. 20)]\r\n\r\nThe Summerville at the type locality in the San Rafael Swell, Utah, is\r\nmuch thicker than in the Monument and contains many chocolate-brown\r\nbeds; but the Summerville exhibits the same lateral continuity of even\r\nthe thinnest beds. Thin sedimentary beds of such uniform thickness are\r\nthought to have accumulated in relatively quiet bodies of water. If you\r\nlook at the undersides of some of the blocks of hard light-gray\r\nsandstone that have broken off, you may see corrugations like those on\r\nsome metal barn roofs. These are ripplemarks produced by wave or current\r\naction while the sand was still loose, which indicates that the water\r\nwas not always entirely quiet. Although much of the Summerville is red,\r\nyou will see beds of many other colors including gray, blue gray,\r\ngreenish gray, chocolate brown, and reddish brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Dinosaurs Roam the Monument\r\n\r\nIn Late Jurassic time the sea to the west eventually dried up, either\r\nbecause it was filled with sediments or because the land rose above sea\r\nlevel, or both. This brought about a change from the parallel bedding in\r\nthe marginal marine environment of the Summerville to irregular\r\nstream-channel sandstones, flood-plain silts and muds, and freshwater\r\nlake deposits.\r\n\r\nStreams from higher lands to the south brought in mud, silt, and sand\r\nthat piled up hundreds of feet thick over thousands of square miles,\r\nincluding the Monument. These sediments were later compacted into the\r\nbrightly colored siltstone, mudstone, sandstone, and limestone now known\r\nas the Morrison Formation. The colors are about the same as those of the\r\nSummerville. Algae and other microscopic organisms extracted calcium\r\ncarbonate from the lake waters, and when they died this material settled\r\non the lake bottoms to make limestone.\r\n\r\nThe soft siltstone and mudstone of the Morrison Formation weather\r\nrapidly into steep or fairly steep slopes, but the harder beds of\r\nsandstone, most of which are in the lower third of the formation, known\r\nas the Salt Wash Member, are sculptured into bold ledges or low cliffs.\r\nThe generally softer upper two-thirds of the formation is called the\r\nBrushy Basin Member. The Morrison is best exposed in and southeast of\r\nThe Redlands, where the bare rocks are carved into badlands like the\r\nfamous ones of South Dakota. Both the Fruita Canyon and No Thoroughfare\r\nCanyon approaches to the Monument pass typical badlands in the Morrison.\r\nThe entire 600 feet of this formation is best seen in the high bluff on\r\nthe east side of the mouth of No Thoroughfare Canyon (fig. 21).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MORRISON FORMATION, on east side of mouth of No\r\n    Thoroughfare Canyon. Forty feet of Summerville Formation at base is\r\n    concealed by slope wash, but underlying white- and salmon-colored\r\n    members of Entrada Sandstone are clearly exposed at lower left.\r\n    Protective caprock at upper right is lowermost sandstone of\r\n    Cretaceous Burro Canyon Formation. Upper two-thirds of Morrison is\r\n    typical of the Brushy Basin Member; lower one-third is not typical\r\n    of the Salt Wash Member, which generally contains more and thicker\r\n    lenses of sandstone, some of which are just around the corner to the\r\n    right. Mesa on left skyline is above Serpents Trail in the Monument.\r\n    Looking west from Little Park Road. See also figures 55 and 60.\r\n    (Fig. 21)]\r\n\r\nIn parts of the Colorado Plateau southwest of the Uncompahgre Plateau,\r\nthe sandstone lenses in the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison contain\r\nuranium and vanadium ore associated with carbonaceous matter, including\r\ncoalified wood. No ores have been found in or near the Monument\r\npresumably because such carbonaceous matter, which helped precipitate\r\nthe ores, is lacking on the northeastern side of the Uncompahgre\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nSome of the beds of siltstone and mudstone in the Brushy Basin Member of\r\nthe Morrison shown in figure 21 contain bentonite, a clay derived from\r\nthe decomposition of volcanic ash, which indicates the presence of\r\nactive volcanos in or near the Plateau at the time these beds were\r\ndeposited. Bentonite swells when wetted, so it is widely used in\r\nwell-drilling muds, sealing canals, etc. Some bentonitic material has\r\nbeen dug from the Brushy Basin along the Little Park Road just south of\r\nthe point from which the photograph in figure 21 was taken and was used\r\nfor sealing irrigation canals in the Grand Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Morrison is not well exposed in the Monument, as the formation is\r\nrestricted to the higher parts where most of it is hidden by vegetation.\r\nThe lower part is seen in roadcuts and outcropping ledges along a high\r\nstretch of Rim Rock Drive between Artists Point and the head of the west\r\narm of Ute Canyon, where sandstone lenses in the Salt Wash Member are\r\nespecially thick.\r\n\r\nThe climate during Morrison time was wet enough to support abundant\r\nvegetation along the many lakes and streams—at least enough to feed the\r\nhungry dinosaurs and other reptiles that roamed the area. Many bones and\r\nparts of several skeletons of dinosaurs have been found in the Morrison\r\nat several places in The Redlands not far northeast and northwest of the\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nThe most famous dinosaur locality near the Monument is Riggs Hill where,\r\nin 1900, the late Elmer S. Riggs of the Field Columbian Museum (now\r\nField Museum of Natural History) dug out part of the first known\r\nskeleton of a huge _Brachiosaurus_ (fig. 22). This discovery made quite\r\na splash in the scientific world, for it was the first and only type of\r\ndinosaur found whose front legs were longer than its hind legs. The\r\nfossilized thigh bone (femur) alone is 6 feet 8 inches long and weighs\r\n549 pounds; the arm bone (humerus), though incomplete, is even longer.\r\nThe ribs are 9 feet long. A bronze plaque now marks the site of the\r\nexcavation (fig. 39).\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Riggs removed all but the forepart of a skeleton of\r\n_Apatosaurus_ from the southeast side of a large hill of the Morrison\r\nFormation just south of the old Fruita bridge. Riggs also found remains\r\nof _Diplodocus_, _Camarasaurus_, and _Morosaurus_, and, in 1937, Al\r\nLook, prominent writer and amateur paleontologist of Grand Junction, and\r\nEdwin L. Holt, an instructor in Mesa College at Grand Junction, found\r\nthe closely associated remains of _Allosaurus_, _Stegosaurus_, and\r\n_Brachiosaurus_ at the western end of Riggs Hill. Dinosaurs generally\r\nare thought of as huge creatures—many were huge indeed (fig. 23)—but\r\nthey came in various sizes and some were quite small.\r\n\r\nAn interesting Late Jurassic vertebrate fossil locality in the Salt Wash\r\nMember of the Morrison Formation, about 3 miles northwest of the West\r\nEntrance of the Monument and about 3 miles southwest of Fruita, was\r\ndiscovered in June 1975 by George Callison, Associate Professor of\r\nBiology and Research Associate in Vertebrate Paleontology at the\r\nCalifornia State University at Long Beach. During the summers of 1975\r\nand 1976 Dr. Callison and his assistants removed the closely associated\r\nskeletal remains of many small, primitive mammals and both small and\r\nlarge dinosaurs and other reptiles. Part of the results were presented\r\nin an unpublished manuscript.[28] During the summer of 1977 and later,\r\nadditional mammalian fossils were removed by Callison and assistants and\r\nadditional reptilian fossils were removed by Lance Erickson,\r\npaleontologist of the Historical Museum and Institute of Western\r\nColorado (fig. 2). Hopefully, the work will be continued with the aid of\r\ngrants from several sources.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EXCAVATING TYPE SPECIMEN OF _BRACHIOSAURUS\r\n    ALTITHORAX_ RIGGS from south side of Riggs Hill.

(Fig. 22)]\r\n\r\nThe locality, which covers parts of about 180 acres of public land\r\nadministered by the Bureau of Land Management, has been fenced and\r\nposted to discourage vandalism, and has been designated the Fruita\r\nPaleontological Area.\r\n\r\nIn order to evaluate the importance of the locality and to make plans\r\nfor its future development and protection, the Bureau of Land Management\r\nheld the Fruita Paleontological Workshop on March 28-30, 1977, to which\r\nwere invited several renowned vertebrate paleontologists and\r\narchaeologists together with interested local personnel of the Bureau,\r\nthe National Park Service, and the Museum. All remarks and prepared\r\nspeeches were taken down by a shorthand reporter and were reproduced for\r\nthe attendees in the 83 page unpublished “The Fruita Paleontological\r\nReport.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKELETONS OF TYPICAL DINOSAURS OF MORRISON\r\n    FORMATION.[29] _A_, _Camptosaurus_, a small dinosaur about 11 feet\r\n    long; _B_, _Apatosaurus_, a gigantic dinosaur about 76 feet long;\r\n    _C_, _Allosaurus_, a large carnivorous dinosaur about 30 feet long;\r\n    and _D_, _Stegosaurus_, a large armored dinosaur about 24 feet long.\r\n    (Fig. 23)]\r\n\r\nThe close association of Late Jurassic mammalian and reptilian fossils,\r\nas found at the Fruita site, is of considerable interest and importance,\r\nbut is by no means unique, for similar associations occur elsewhere in\r\nColorado, and in Wyoming, Europe, and Africa. Of those in the United\r\nStates, the quarry at Como Bluff, near Laramie, Wyo., is considered by\r\nmost of the experts to be the most outstanding. Of the material\r\nunearthed at Fruita thus far, which includes bones of some of the large\r\ndinosaurs found earlier by Riggs, remains of some of the smaller\r\ndinosaurs and a complete skull of the moderately large flesh eater\r\n_Ceratosaurus_ are considered the most important.\r\n\r\nFreshwater clam and snail shells abound in some beds of the Morrison,\r\nparticularly in limestones, and occur sparingly in other types of beds.\r\nThe shells occur mainly in The Redlands, particularly about 1½ miles\r\nwest of the Fruita bridge. Some of these shells that are filled with\r\nagate are sought by rockhounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Dinosaurs on the Move\r\n\r\nThe wet climate of Late Jurassic time was followed by arid or semiarid\r\nclimate in the Early Cretaceous. Streams continued to deposit gravel,\r\nsand, silt, and mud, but at a much slower rate. These deposits\r\neventually hardened into the conglomerate, sandstone, and green shale or\r\nsiltstone of the Burro Canyon Formation. This formation, together with\r\npart of the overlying Dakota Sandstone, caps Black Ridge, the highest\r\npart of the Monument (7,000 feet) about a mile west of the Coke Ovens.\r\nSeveral airway beacons on this high ridge may be seen for many miles.\r\nThe Burro Canyon is best seen below the Monument on the west side of\r\nMonument Road along the lower part of No Thoroughfare Canyon, where it\r\nis about 60 feet thick (fig. 24).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BURRO CANYON FORMATION AND DAKOTA SANDSTONE, along\r\n    west side of No Thoroughfare Canyon, about 2½ miles northeast of the\r\n    Monument’s East Entrance. Basal sandstone above road and unexposed\r\n    green shale (brown in photograph) comprise the Burro Canyon, here 58\r\n    feet thick. White band two-thirds the way up the slope is 40-foot\r\n    basal conglomerate of the Dakota Sandstone, above which is 58 feet\r\n    of carbonaceous shale, a 14-foot bed of sandstone, and 17 feet of\r\n    sandy shale to the top of the hill. The top of the Dakota has been\r\n    eroded away. (Fig. 24)]\r\n\r\nA few fossil plants and shells have come from the Burro Canyon\r\nFormation, but the seeming absence of dinosaur bones suggests that\r\npossibly these reptiles had to move to areas of greater precipitation,\r\nwhere food was more abundant. Some dinosaurs may have lived in the area\r\nat this time, but their bones either were not fossilized or they have\r\nnot yet been found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Yet Another Gap in the Rock Record\r\n\r\nDeposition of the Burro Canyon Formation was brought to a close by\r\nanother uplift of the Plateau, and of course the uplift was followed by\r\nanother period of erosion, which continued through the end of Early\r\nCretaceous time. As noted in the caption for figure 24, seemingly all\r\nbut 58 feet of the Burro Canyon was eroded away, but 120 feet remains\r\nalong East Creek, only about 12 miles to the southeast, which suggests\r\nthat the old erosion surface was a bit uneven. That this period of\r\nerosion was of considerable duration is suggested by the abundance of\r\nthe white clay mineral, kaolinite, beneath and in the overlying white\r\nbasal conglomerate of the Dakota Sandstone. This type of clay commonly\r\nresults from prolonged weathering of many types of rocks and indicates\r\nthat the period of pre-Dakota erosion was of long duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Peat Bogs\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of Late Cretaceous time the eroded surface of the\r\nMonument was part of a low plain near sea level, and the sea was\r\ngradually encroaching from the east or northeast. Gravel and sand\r\ncarried in by streams combined with the white kaolinite on the surface\r\nto form the 40-foot basal conglomerate of the Dakota Sandstone (fig.\r\n24).\r\n\r\nAs the land gradually subsided nearer to sea level, swamps which were\r\nformed along the coast supported considerable vegetation. As the trees\r\nand plants died and were covered by silt and mud, they gradually changed\r\nto peat which finally became compacted into coal and brown or black\r\ncoaly shale containing plant remains. You can dig out some of this coal\r\nand perhaps find some plant remains near the top of the west canyon wall\r\njust below the highest sandstone bed in figure 24, which is outside the\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nFor awhile the coast alternately sank slightly below and rose slightly\r\nabove sea level. Beach sand covered the swamp deposits, then more swamp\r\ndeposits covered the sand. Some of the sand contains seashells, such as\r\noysters and clams.\r\n\r\nExcept on Black Ridge, the Dakota has been entirely eroded from the\r\nMonument, but it crops out with the underlying Burro Canyon in a series\r\nof low hills south of the Colorado River. The Dakota Sandstone is about\r\n200 feet thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Sea Covers the Plateau\r\n\r\nStill later in the Cretaceous Period the whole region sank beneath the\r\nsea and stayed there a long time. Silt and limy mud were piled layer\r\nupon layer on the sea floor and hardened into the gray and black Mancos\r\nShale. Thin layers of sand were cemented into sandstone, and layers of\r\ncalcium-carbonate mud became chalk or limestone. Seashells and bones of\r\nsharks and seagoing reptiles have been found in the Mancos in many\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe Mancos and all younger rocks have been stripped off the Monument,\r\nbut they may be seen one after the other as you travel northeastward.\r\nThin remnants of the Mancos cap low hills just south of the Colorado\r\nRiver, and the entire 3,800 feet of the Mancos underlies the Grand\r\nValley and Book Cliffs. The upper part is clearly exposed in the\r\ntowering, barren Book Cliffs, where the soft shale is protected by a\r\ncaprock of hard sandstone—the lowermost unit of the overlying Late\r\nCretaceous Mesaverde Group (fig. 25).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Sea’s Final Retreat\r\n\r\nSlow uplift of the Plateau, including the Monument region, caused the\r\ngradual retreat of the Mancos sea. Deposition of mud on the sea bottom\r\ngave way to deposition of beach sand, coal swamps, and then more beach\r\nsand and coal swamps. Finally, in Late Cretaceous time, the sea withdrew\r\nentirely, never again to return to the Colorado Plateau region.\r\n\r\nStreams deposited sand, silt, and mud on the newly uplifted coastal\r\nareas. All these deposits, including some high-grade bituminous coal\r\nthat was formed in the swamps, we now know as the Mesaverde Group. The\r\nthick cliff-forming sandstones of this unit are beautifully displayed in\r\nDeBeque Canyon of the Colorado River between Palisade and DeBeque, just\r\nupstream from the Grand Valley. There are several active coal mines in\r\nthe Mesaverde between Palisade and Cameo, and outcrops of coal may be\r\nseen on the east side of the road just south of Cameo. The electric\r\ngenerating station of the Public Service Company of Colorado at Cameo is\r\nconveniently situated over a coal mine and next to the Colorado River,\r\nwhich supplies cooling water.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOUNT GARFIELD, a prominent point on the Book Cliffs\r\n    bordering the northeastern side of the Grand Valley. Slopes are\r\n    Mancos Shale; ledge about halfway upslope is the toe of an ancient\r\n    landslide deposit of Mesaverde sandstone blocks marking the level of\r\n    an ancestral Grand Valley; capping beds of sandstone at crest are\r\n    basal beds of Mesaverde Group.

Some\r\nof these, in coal mines along the Book Cliffs and near Cedaredge, are 38\r\ninches across and their placement indicates an incredible stride of 16¼\r\nfeet! Had there been highways in Mesaverde time, this bipedal giant\r\ncould have crossed them in two strides.\r\n\r\nBoth the Mancos and Mesaverde once covered the Monument area but were\r\nremoved long ago by erosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          End of the Dinosaurs\r\n\r\nThe end of the Cretaceous Period was also the end of the dinosaurs.\r\nExactly why the “terrible lizards” died out after dominating the world\r\nfor more than 150 million years is not known for sure, but many guesses\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\nOne likely idea is that widespread uplift and mountain building that\r\nbegan late in Cretaceous time, accompanied by changes in climate, may\r\nhave greatly reduced the supply of soft edible plants. If so, it is easy\r\nto imagine how huge dinosaurs accustomed to a ton or more of lush plant\r\nfood each day would soon starve to death.\r\n\r\nMany dinosaurs were vegetarians. As they died out, the flesheaters, such\r\nas _Tyrannosaurus_, soon ran short of food also, and probably began to\r\neat each other. _Tyrannosaurus_ closely resembled the Jurassic\r\n_Allosaurus_ shown in figure 23, except that _Tyrannosaurus_ was much\r\nlarger and more formidable—in fact it probably was the most terrible\r\npredator that ever roamed the surface of the Earth. The dinosaurs had\r\nbecome too highly specialized to their environment to adapt themselves\r\nto changes of this kind.\r\n\r\nAnother fascinating notion is that the growing population of small\r\nprimitive mammals devoured dinosaur eggs (which were left unattended\r\nlike those of turtles and alligators) nearly as fast as mamma dinosaur\r\ncould lay them. But whatever the reason, it is clear that some worldwide\r\ncondition caused the gradual extinction of the ponderous\r\nover-specialized dinosaurs and allowed the rise to power of the next\r\ntypes of animals destined to rule the Earth—the brainier and more\r\nadaptable mammals.\r\n\r\nAt this time the rocks were gently bent into upfolds, called anticlines\r\nor arches, and downfolds, called synclines or basins (fig. 27). One\r\nupfold that began to take form was the Uncompahgre arch, the crest of\r\nwhich shapes Piñon Mesa just south of the Monument. But this gentle\r\nupfold was to grow larger and to have its flanks wrinkled and broken in\r\nthe next geologic era—the Cenozoic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Age of Mammals\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the Cenozoic Era 65 million years ago—give or take a\r\nfew million years—marked the beginning of a long span of geologic time\r\nduring which mammals became the ruling land animals. Remains of some\r\nsmall primitive mammals have been found in Mesozoic rocks (p. 50), but\r\nthese tiny newcomers did not have a chance to flourish until the\r\nformidable dinosaurs died out.\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic Era is divided into the long Tertiary Period—The Age of\r\nMammals—and the short (about 2 million years) Quaternary Period—The Age\r\nof Man. The Tertiary in turn is divided into five epochs—the Paleocene,\r\nEocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene (fig. 61). Events during parts\r\nof the Tertiary Period had an important bearing upon the Monument even\r\nthough no rocks of this period now occur in the area.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COMMON TYPES OF ROCK FOLDS.

Top and middle\r\n    diagrams from Hansen (1969, p. 31, 108). (Fig. 27)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Early Deposits and Events\r\n\r\nThe broad inland basins that were formed late in the Cretaceous Period\r\nreceived sand, silt, and mud brought in by streams from the uplifted or\r\nfolded areas. These materials became compacted into the Wasatch\r\nFormation—the red or pink rock from which Bryce Canyon National Park was\r\nsculptured. One such basin lay just northeast of the Monument. The\r\nMonument probably was covered by some of these stream deposits after the\r\nmain basin was partly filled.\r\n\r\nThe mammals that roamed the area during the Paleocene Epoch were\r\nprimitive, but more advanced forms appeared later, in Eocene time. Some\r\nof their fossil remains have been found in the Wasatch Formation in\r\nPlateau Creek Valley north of Grand Mesa and near Rifle, about 60 miles\r\nnortheast of Grand Junction. The entire 5,000 feet of the Wasatch may be\r\nseen along U.S. Highway I-70 between the towns of DeBeque and Grand\r\nValley, and much of it helps support towering Grand and Battlement\r\nMesas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Lake Uinta\r\n\r\nIn Eocene time the northern part of the Colorado Plateau sagged downward\r\nand gradually filled with water until it became a huge lake, now known\r\nas Lake Uinta. The waters in it teemed with plants and animals,\r\nparticularly micro-organisms such as algae, whose remains, coated with\r\ncalcium carbonate, settled to the bottom along with the sand, silt, and\r\nmud washed into the lake by streams. These sediments compacted into the\r\nremarkable Green River Formation which contains, among many rock types,\r\nlarge deposits of rich oil shale.\r\n\r\nThe light-colored Green River Formation, which is about 3,800 feet\r\nthick, may be seen from U.S. Highway I-70 in the upper part of the\r\ntowering Roan Cliffs on the northwest side of the Colorado River between\r\nDeBeque and Rifle. It also underlies the volcanic caprock of Grand and\r\nBattlement Mesas. John R. Donnell, of the U.S. Geological Survey,\r\nestimated that the oil shale in the Piceance Creek Basin, northwest of\r\nthe Colorado River alone, contains more than one trillion barrels of\r\noil. The Monument was at or near the south shore of this lake, and may\r\nhave been covered with a few hundred feet of the Green River Formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Mountains Rise Again\r\n\r\nLakes, like mountains, are temporary things. Even as lakes are forming,\r\nsediment begins to fill them until ultimately they are obliterated. So\r\nit was with Lake Uinta. Sometime after this lake dried up, the Earth’s\r\ncrust again became restless. The gentle folds that were formed late in\r\nthe Cretaceous were lifted higher and bent more sharply, and the flanks\r\nof some folds were wrinkled and broken (figs. 27, 28). The sharply bent\r\nor broken rocks along the northeastern border of the Monument are\r\nthought to have been deformed mainly at this time, but in part both\r\nearlier and later. That pronounced folding of the rocks followed the\r\ndeposition of the Eocene Green River Formation is clearly shown along\r\nthe Grand Hogback monocline between the towns of Rifle and Meeker,\r\nColorado, where the once flat lying beds of the Green River and Wasatch\r\nFormations now stand vertical.\r\n\r\nThe folds and faults along the northeastern border of the Monument,\r\nwhich are shown on the geologic map (fig. 8), are discussed briefly\r\nhere—more details are given later in “Trips through and around the\r\nMonument.” The folded and faulted northeastern border of the Monument,\r\nwhich is shown in figure 29 and in several ensuing photographs, is\r\nbelieved to have resulted from renewed uplift of the area southwest of\r\nthe folds and faults, including the Monument. The Redlands fault (figs.\r\n8, 29, 37, 38, 40, 41) generally is a normal fault but locally is a\r\nreverse fault, as discussed on page 92 and as shown in figure 40 and in\r\nthe cross section of figure 8. This fault has a maximum vertical\r\ndisplacement of 700 or 800 feet, but dies out in scissors fashion at\r\neach end. Beyond the end of the Redlands fault in the upper right of\r\nfigure 29 may be seen another unbroken monocline. A close-up view of the\r\nnorthwestern end of this fold in shown in figure 30.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COMMON TYPES OF FAULTS. Top, normal, or gravity,\r\n    fault which generally results from tension in and lengthening of a\r\n    segment of the Earth’s crust, which allows the lower block to\r\n    subside. However, some normal faults, particularly some that are\r\n    vertical or nearly so, may result from uplift of the upper block.\r\n    Low-angle reverse faults generally are called overthrust faults or\r\n    simply overthrusts. In both the normal and reverse faults note\r\n    amount of displacement and repetition of strata. Displacement of\r\n    such faults may range from a few inches to many thousands of feet,\r\n    and in overthrusts may reach many miles. From Hansen (1969, p. 116).\r\n    (Fig. 28)]\r\n\r\nIf we proceed about a quarter of a mile northeast of the point from\r\nwhich figure 30 was taken, walk about 50 feet north, and look to the\r\nnorthwest, we see quite a different structure, for here the gentle lower\r\nfold of the Lizard Canyon monocline has become the east end of the\r\nKodels Canyon fault (fig. 31).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LADDER CREEK MONOCLINE AND REDLANDS FAULT, telephoto\r\n    view looking northwest from point near Little Park Road east of the\r\n    Monument.

The old Serpents Trail, the\r\n    lower part of which is barely visible, ascends this dipping block of\r\n    rock. The dark Proterozoic rocks form the flat-topped bluff to the\r\n    right and are exposed by the Redlands fault which lies just above\r\n    the sharply upturned remnants of the Wingate Sandstone.

Here, along a normal fault dipping steeply northeastward, the\r\n    350-foot cliff of Wingate Sandstone at upper left has been sheared\r\n    and squeezed into only a few feet of broken rock overlain by a steep\r\n    slope of the Kayenta Formation covered by piñon and juniper. The\r\n    thinner cliff at right is the Entrada Sandstone which belongs high\r\n    atop the cliffs at left. Book Cliffs form distant skyline at right.\r\n    (Fig. 31)]\r\n\r\nIf you doubt that figure 31 shows a fault, a glance at figure 32 in the\r\nnext major canyon eight-tenths of a mile to the northwest should\r\nconvince you. Here, on the northwest side of Kodels Canyon, the Wingate\r\nwas not thinned but was rent completely asunder by the vertical Kodels\r\nCanyon fault (fig. 32). Kodels Canyon is not readily accessible to\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nThe Lizard Canyon monocline, Kodels Canyon fault, and other structures\r\nare clearly shown in the stereoscopic pair of aerial photographs in\r\nfigure 33.\r\n\r\nAnother structural feature within the Monument is the Glade Park fault\r\n(fig. 8), which lies mainly south of the Monument but just cuts across\r\nthe south end of No Thoroughfare Canyon in the latest addition to the\r\nMonument. It is well shown both from the air and the ground in figures\r\n58 and 59. It is unique among all the major faults in the area in that\r\nthe rocks south of the fault subsided with respect to those on the north\r\nside.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: KODELS CANYON FAULT, looking northwestward across\r\n    canyon of same name. Base of Wingate cliff on left is just about\r\n    opposite the top of the Wingate on right. Here, nature was kind to\r\n    the geologist, for the vertical displacement (rise of left side with\r\n    respect to right side) is virtually the thickness of the Wingate\r\n    Sandstone—about 350 feet. The Wingate on the right is lighter\r\n    colored than that on the left seemingly because rockfalls removed\r\n    desert-varnish-coated rocks and exposed the true color of the\r\n    sandstone.

(Fig. 33)]\r\n\r\nAt this point in our story it might be well to point out that the\r\nfolding and faulting of the rocks just described occurred when thousands\r\nof feet of younger rocks covered the area. Additional folding and\r\nfaulting, drainage changes, and gradual removal of the overlying rocks\r\noccurred during the remainder of the Tertiary and Quaternary Periods, as\r\nwill be discussed further.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Nearby Lava Flows[30]\r\n\r\nGrand and Battlement Mesas, respectively east and northeast of the\r\nMonument, are capped by several resistant thick flows of dark basaltic\r\nlava. The molten rock welled up through fissures at the east end of\r\nGrand Mesa and flowed westward and northwestward over the eroded surface\r\nof Eocene rocks. Radiometric dating of a sample of the basalt indicated\r\nan age of 9½ million years plus or minus half a million years, placing\r\nthe event in the Miocene Epoch of the Tertiary Period (fig. 61).\r\n\r\nA small remnant of the lava on the crest of the Roan Cliffs just\r\nsouthwest of the present town of Grand Valley indicates that the flows\r\ncrossed this part of the ancestral Colorado River Valley and may have\r\npushed the young stream westward.\r\n\r\nThe lava flows are about 800 feet thick on the eastern part of Grand\r\nMesa but are only about 200 feet thick above the western rim of the\r\nmesa. As the ancestral Gunnison River is believed to be pre-Miocene in\r\nage, it is not known whether or not the lava flows crossed the old river\r\nvalley and reached as far west as the Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Ancestral Colorado River\r\n\r\nDuring most of the Pliocene Epoch the ancestral Colorado River did not\r\nflow past what is now Grand Junction; instead, it joined with the\r\nancestral Gunnison River about 10 miles southeast of the present city,\r\nand the combined streams flowed southwestward across the slowly rising\r\nUncompahgre arch through what was later to be called Unaweep Canyon\r\n(fig. 36). Southwest of the canyon, near the site of the present town of\r\nGateway, the ancestral Colorado River was joined by the combined flows\r\nof the ancestral San Miguel River and the previously diverted ancestral\r\nDolores River, then it flowed northwestward to what is now the mainstem\r\nof the Colorado River.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to show my ideas of this ancient drainage system as it\r\nmay have existed in middle to late Pliocene time in figure 34. But the\r\nstage was set for more spectacular drainage changes to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Piracy on the High Plateaus\r\n\r\nRivers, like people, do not always choose their courses wisely. After a\r\nfew million years of downcutting through the soft sedimentary rocks,\r\nmainly what is now called the Mancos Shale, the ancestral Colorado and\r\nGunnison Rivers found themselves cutting through the hard Proterozoic\r\nrocks in a deep gorge athwart the slowly rising Uncompahgre arch, which\r\ngreatly slowed the downcutting power of the combined streams. Note in\r\nfigure 34_A_ that while the mighty ancestral Colorado and Gunnison\r\nRivers were in this frustrating predicament, a young upstart tributary\r\nbegan cutting northward from what is now the mouth of the Dolores River\r\n(fig. 34_D_). Although the combined main rivers could lower their\r\nchannel only very slowly because of the hard rock in Unaweep Canyon, the\r\ntributary was able to cut downward and headward quite rapidly through\r\nthe soft Mancos Shale. It eventually cut around the northwestward\r\ndipping Uncompahgre arch and headed southeastward toward the ancestral\r\nColorado River near the present site of Palisade.\r\n\r\nThen occurred an act of piracy that put to shame the mightiest exploits\r\nof Blackbeard and Captain Kidd. In latest Pliocene or earliest\r\nPleistocene time additional uplift of the Uncompahgre arch, an unusually\r\nlarge flood, or both, caused the ancestral Colorado River to overflow\r\nits banks and spill across a low shale divide into the headwaters of the\r\ntributary. Some ponding may have preceded the spillover. With this\r\nenormously increased supply of water, the tributary cut down rapidly\r\nthrough the soft shale and captured the entire flow of the Colorado\r\nRiver, but the ancestral Gunnison River still flowed through Unaweep\r\nCanyon, as shown in figure 34_B_. Stream capture of this type is\r\nappropriately called “piracy.”\r\n\r\nBut the piracy had not ended. Note in figure 34_B_ that the “new” river\r\nsent out several tributaries, one of which headed for and, with the aid\r\nof yet additional and greater uplift, soon captured the ancestral\r\nGunnison River, as shown in figure 34_C_. This second act of piracy left\r\nUnaweep Canyon really “high and dry” except for small streams that\r\ncarried off what little water the canyon received from local rain and\r\nsnow. While these piracies were taking place, the Book Cliffs and the\r\nedge of Grand Mesa gradually retreated away from the valley because of\r\nerosion, and more of the Uncompahgre arch was uncovered.\r\n\r\nThe rising Uncompahgre arch, whose renewed uplifts in latest Pliocene or\r\nearliest Pleistocene times played such an important role in the ultimate\r\nabandonment of ancestral Unaweep Canyon, was asymmetric in that the\r\ncrest was not in the middle but was near the southwest side. Although\r\nsharp, locally faulted monoclines are found on both sides of the arch,\r\nincluding the part within the Monument, in general, the northeastern\r\nflank has a rather gentle northeastward dip; whereas, the southwestern\r\nflank of the arch also is bordered by normal faults of considerable\r\nvertical displacement.[31] Thus, after abandonment, the minor drainage\r\nin Unaweep Canyon continued to flow northeastward from a new divide near\r\nthe southwestern border, and ancestral West Creek began cutting\r\nnortheastward toward the new divide. The drainage pattern depicted in\r\nfigure 34_C_ differs slightly from my earlier interpretation and results\r\nfrom additional fieldwork.[32]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PROBABLE DRAINAGE PATTERNS AND LAND FORMS NEAR THE\r\n    MONUMENT AT FOUR SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.

The reasons for its change in shape and\r\nappearance to the beautiful U-shaped canyon we find today and the\r\nprofound effect the abandonment of Unaweep Canyon had on the deepening\r\nof the Grand Valley and the canyons of the Monument will be brought out\r\nin the section “Canyon Cutting.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Age of Man\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the dinosaurs before them, a few of the Tertiary mammals were so\r\nlong on brawn and short on brains that they evolved into grotesque\r\nmonsters and overspecialized themselves into early extinction.\r\nFortunately, however, most of the mammals evolved more slowly and\r\nmoderately into the forms we find today.\r\n\r\nOne group—the anthropoid primates—began to think, so they developed\r\ntheir brains rather than their brawn, particularly the Tertiary\r\nancestors of man. Few remains of these ancestors have been found in\r\nTertiary rocks, but many more have been discovered in rocks of the next\r\ngeologic period—the Quaternary. Thus, this period may properly be\r\nregarded as the age of man, for man then began to dominate the Earth for\r\nbetter or for worse.\r\n\r\nThe Quaternary—latest and shortest of the geologic periods—is divided\r\ninto the Pleistocene and Holocene (recent) Epochs (fig. 61).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Ice Age\r\n\r\nDuring the Pleistocene Epoch, all continents of the Northern Hemisphere\r\nand some of the Southern Hemisphere were partly covered at least four\r\ntimes by huge glaciers. Each glacial advance in Europe and North America\r\nwas ended by a warmer interval during which the glaciers melted and\r\nretreated northward; then, vegetation and soil had time to become\r\nre-established. Thus, the Pleistocene has properly been called the ice\r\nage.\r\n\r\nNone of the continental glaciers reached the Monument or the Uncompahgre\r\nPlateau, or arch, but small alpine glaciers grew in the high Rocky\r\nMountains to the east, sculpturing sharp-crested peaks and ridges and\r\nforming beautiful valleys and lakes. Many of the beautiful lakes on\r\nGrand Mesa were formed by glaciation, but some near the edges were\r\nformed by landslides.\r\n\r\nThe increased streamflow from the greater precipitation and from melting\r\nalpine glaciers in the Rockies, particularly during times of glacial\r\nretreat, helped the Colorado River cut through the rocks faster, thus\r\nassisting in the formation of Colorado National Monument as we see it\r\ntoday. The river carried thousands of cubic miles of sediment to the\r\nGulf of California, including a lot of rock that once covered the\r\nMonument, and the river is still actively at work on this immense\r\nearthmoving project.\r\n\r\nIf the ancestral Colorado River carried sediment at about the same rate\r\nas the present river since the building of Hoover Dam, it may have\r\ncarried about 3 cubic miles of sediment each century. Now most of the\r\nrock debris is being dumped into Lake Powell—the new reservoir behind\r\nGlen Canyon Dam. When this, Lake Mead, and other reservoirs ultimately\r\nbecome filled with sediment, the Gulf of California will again be the\r\nburial ground.\r\n\r\nBut other events during the Pleistocene also played a role in shaping\r\nthe area. The Uncompahgre arch was again uplifted and deformed in the\r\nPleistocene soon after the abandonment of Unaweep Canyon. This caused\r\nadded tilting of the strata and more bending and breaking along some of\r\nthe folds and faults in the Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Capture of East Creek\r\n\r\nEast Creek, which drains the northeastern half of Unaweep Canyon, was\r\nforced to change its course during the Pleistocene Epoch by another act\r\nof piracy. After capture of the Gunnison River by the newly routed\r\nColorado River, East Creek joined the Gunnison by way of Cactus Park.\r\nThen, a tributary of North East Creek headed southward and captured East\r\nCreek, as shown in figure 34_D_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Canyon Cutting\r\n\r\nWhen the Colorado River was diverted into its new course through the\r\nGrand Valley past the Monument, the stream channel seems to have been\r\nonly about 600 to 800 feet higher than it is today, but the present\r\ndivide in Unaweep Canyon is now about 2,500 feet higher than the\r\nchannel. The difference of 1,700 to 1,900 feet was caused by the\r\nadditional uplift of the Uncompahgre arch during the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nThus, the Grand Valley and its tributary canyons, such as those of\r\nColorado National Monument, were cut since the abandonment of Unaweep\r\nCanyon, probably mainly during the Quaternary Period. This suggests that\r\nthe cutting of the Monument’s canyons began only about 2 million years\r\nago, but that much of the canyon cutting occurred only a few hundred\r\nthousand years ago. Indeed, the canyons are still slowly being deepened,\r\nlengthened, and widened.\r\n\r\nAs you stand on any of the lookout points and gaze down into the canyons\r\nof the Monument, you may well wonder how such immense chasms could have\r\nbeen cut by such puny streams that are dry most of the time. The streams\r\nflow only for short periods after heavy thundershowers or after rapid\r\nmelting of snow. If you are lucky enough to see them flow, you will\r\nnotice that the water is red or brown because of the suspended mud,\r\nsilt, and sand. If the flow is large, you may see or hear pebbles and\r\ncobbles rolling along the bed. Accordingly, the streams and their\r\ncutting tools are slowly deepening the channels. But, you may ask, how\r\ndoes this account for such wide, broad-bottomed, cliff-walled canyons?\r\nSuch streams act mainly as storm sewers to carry off the rock debris\r\nformed by other types of erosion.\r\n\r\nWhen cutting first began, the Monument’s canyons were narrow, steep, and\r\nV-shaped. When the top of the hard, dark Proterozoic rocks was reached,\r\nhowever, downcutting slowed just as it had earlier in Unaweep Canyon.\r\nWhile the streams were thus hung up, other erosional processes caused\r\nthe cliff walls to recede away from the streams, forming broad,\r\nflat-bottomed, U-shaped canyons.\r\n\r\nRecession of the cliffs away from the middle of the canyons probably was\r\ncaused partly by undercutting of the soft Chinle Formation by wind and\r\nin places by streams. This allowed slabs of the overlying Wingate\r\nSandstone and younger rocks to break off and fall into the\r\ncanyons—eventually to break up and to be carted off as sand and mud by\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nBut other processes are probably the ones chiefly responsible for the\r\npresent shape and width of the canyons. The summer sun heats the cliff\r\nfaces until they are hot to the touch, but in the present desert climate\r\nof the Monument the rocks cool rapidly after sundown. Oftentimes the hot\r\ncliff faces are chilled rapidly by summer thundershowers. Repeated\r\nheating, cooling, wetting, and drying causes expansion and contraction\r\nof the rocks so that thin layers break off and fall. This process goes\r\non slowly even in winter on sun-facing cliffs, but it does not occur on\r\nthe cliffs that face away from the winter sun.\r\n\r\nEven more important, perhaps, is the alternate freezing at night and\r\nthawing by day on sun-facing cliff faces during the winter. Water in\r\ncracks near the cliff faces alternately freezes and melts, gradually\r\nprying off slabs of rock. Canyon walls that are shaded from the sun most\r\nof the winter, however, stay cold or frozen much of the winter; hence,\r\nthey are not subject to repeated heating and cooling or freezing and\r\nthawing. Thus, you will notice that because of talus accumulation many\r\nsuch canyon walls are sloping rather than vertical.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the above conjectures concerning the cutting and shaping\r\nof the canyons, let us consider several canyons that trend in different\r\ndirections. We have seen in figure 12 that the left side of\r\nnortheastward trending Red Canyon is a nearly vertical cliff that faces\r\nthe sun most of the winter; whereas, the right side, which is shaded\r\nmost of the winter, slopes gently enough to be climbed at many places.\r\nThe sides of Ute Canyon, which trends more nearly northward (fig. 52),\r\nslope about equally, as would be expected. However, the west arm of the\r\nCanyon, which trends slightly southeastward, has sides whose slopes\r\ndiffer markedly (fig. 35).\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the remarkable transformation of the original V-shape\r\nof Unaweep Canyon to the beautiful U-shape of the present canyon, which\r\nis shown in figure 36. The abandonment of Unaweep Canyon discussed\r\nearlier removed the gigantic storm sewer that for millions of years\r\ncarried off the products of vigorous erosion of the canyon walls by the\r\nprocesses just described. Rock materials that now fall from the cliffs\r\nof the inner gorge in hard Proterozoic rocks and that fall from the\r\noverlying softer sedimentary rocks simply pile up at the foot of the\r\ncliffs to form a canyon equally as U-shaped as those cut by glaciers in\r\nthe high mountains. Indeed, Unaweep Canyon has been mistaken for a\r\nglacial canyon by many, including some geologists.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FALLEN ROCK, in west arm of Ute Canyon below\r\n    waterfall, from Fallen Rock Overlook. Note that the sun-facing left\r\n    side of canyon, containing the fallen block of Wingate Sandstone, is\r\n    a vertical cliff; whereas, the shaded right side can be readily\r\n    climbed. The right side contains a trail near the middle of the\r\n    picture, but it is hidden by vegetation. (Fig. 35)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: UNAWEEP CANYON, looking southwest from rim of inner\r\n    gorge cut in hard Proterozoic rocks, just to the right side of first\r\n    cattle guard on Divide Road, near middle of sec. 16, T. 14S., R. 100\r\n    W., about 5 miles northeast of drainage divide shown in figure\r\n    34_D_. Drainage divide is just around the corner to the right of the\r\n    most distant part of the canyon visible. Slope above vertical cliff\r\n    on right consists of Chinle Formation, Wingate Sandstone, and flat\r\n    crest of Entrada Sandstone (Kayenta Formation is absent). Paved road\r\n    in canyon is Colorado Highway 141. (Fig. 36)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A Look into the Future\r\n\r\nThis ends the brief geologic story of Colorado National Monument, except\r\nfor a peek into the future, a description of trips through and around\r\nthe Monument, and a comparison with other Parks and Monuments on the\r\nPlateau. The temporary nature of lakes, rivers, and even mountains has\r\nbeen discussed—the Monument of today and the new course of the Colorado\r\nRiver are no exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado River did not solve its problems by abandoning its\r\nhard-rock course in Unaweep Canyon in favor of a soft-rock course\r\nthrough Ruby and Westwater Canyons—it just postponed them. The river has\r\nagain cut down into its old nemesis—the hard Proterozoic rock—in Ruby\r\nCanyon just within the Colorado border, in Westwater Canyon in Utah, and\r\nthe Gunnison River has reached the hard rock at its confluence with\r\nDominguez Creek, not far above Whitewater, as shown in figure 34_D_.\r\nThus, once again hard rock is slowing down old man river, and will slow\r\nhim down for a long time to come. Someday, Westwater and Ruby Canyons\r\nwill be deep gorges like Unaweep Canyon. Then it is quite possible that\r\nanother young tributary may sneak around the Uncompahgre arch some miles\r\nnorthwest of these canyons and pirate the river into a new soft-rock\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the Monument will have changed appearance considerably.\r\nSome of the canyons will have come together by eating away the ramparts\r\nthat separated them—just as the two entrances of Monument Canyon have\r\nalready done. But as the lower canyons thus eliminate themselves, the\r\nheadwaters will bite deeper into Piñon Mesa, so perhaps the Monument\r\nwill simply creep slowly southwestward. However, renewed uplift, more\r\nvolcanos, changes in climate, or other events could alter the picture.\r\n\r\nStill, if the geologic clock ran as fast as the ones we use, the picture\r\nof the Monument we see today would be on the screen only a small\r\nfraction of a split second. But the geologic clock ticks on, slowly but\r\nsurely, and, someday, the Holocene Epoch in which we live will become\r\njust another brief chapter in the long geologic history of the Earth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        How to See the Monument\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to see the monument depends in large part on how long you can stay,\r\nbut it depends also upon the direction you are travelling to or through\r\nGrand Junction and Fruita, and on the mode of transportation. Moreover,\r\nthe Monument has four entrances—two main entrances from Fruita (West\r\nEntrance) and Grand Junction (East Entrance), and two subordinate\r\nentrances from the Glade Park area to the southwest.\r\n\r\nThough by no means as well known as our large National Parks, Colorado\r\nNational Monument is more readily accessible than many. It is on two\r\ntranscontinental highways (U.S. 6 and 50), is the western terminus of\r\nU.S. 24, and is on nearly completed Interstate 70, one of the most\r\nscenic transcontinental Interstate Highways. Highway I-70 supersedes\r\nmany stretches of U.S. 6, 24, and 50, but the latter are still used in\r\nparts of the Grand Valley and elsewhere. The Monument also is on the\r\nmain line of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, which still\r\nmaintains limited passenger service between Denver and Salt Lake City,\r\nbut this service may eventually be terminated. Grand Junction’s Walker\r\nField is served by several airlines, and both Grand Junction and Fruita\r\nare served by busses.\r\n\r\nMany people driving through the Grand Valley for the first time are\r\nunaware of the Monument’s existence unless they happen to see it on a\r\nroadmap or see road signs pointing toward it, but unfortunately the\r\nsigns are unevenly and poorly distributed. People entering Grand\r\nJunction from the east on U.S. 6 and 24 or from the southeast on U.S. 50\r\nare apt to see one or more of the signs—particularly when crossing Grand\r\nAvenue on First or Fifth Streets. If they are heading westward and can\r\ndevote at least half a day, they may drive to the East Entrance, follow\r\nRim Rock Drive for 22 miles northwestward through the Monument, stop at\r\nsome or most of the scenic overlooks and the Visitor Center, leave via\r\nthe West Entrance, and proceed northwestward on U.S. 6 and 50 or better\r\nyet on I-70. However, as will be described below, longer stops are much\r\nmore rewarding. Those driving eastward on I-70 may see the sign at the\r\nFruita interchange pointing southward toward the Monument—and may take\r\nthe above described quickie trip in reverse. Those heading northwestward\r\non I-70, however, may not be aware of the Monument until they see the\r\nsign at the Fruita interchange; then, they may not have or take time to\r\ndouble back southeastward through the Monument. If they do drive\r\nsoutheastward through the Monument, however, they can return to Fruita\r\nfollowing a very scenic northwesterly route through The Redlands on\r\nBroadway (Colo. Highway 340) and South Broadway, or they may take a\r\npaved shortcut from near the East Entrance to South Broadway via South\r\nCamp Road (p. 118). Drinking water and sanitary restrooms are available\r\nin the headquarters area in the campgrounds and picnic grounds and\r\nVisitor Center, and in the Devils Kitchen Picnic Area. Food is not\r\navailable in the Monument, so those planning to remain all day should\r\nbring lunches.\r\n\r\nI have conducted many groups through the Monument, always choosing to\r\ntravel northwestward from Grand Junction through The Redlands, just\r\nnortheast of the Monument, to the West Entrance, then returning\r\nsoutheastward through the Monument.[33] On most days, taking the trip in\r\nthese directions affords good lighting for photographing most of the\r\nscenic features. This and other routes are described in the next section\r\nand are plainly labeled so that the visitor may start with any trip he\r\nor she chooses. Regardless of how long you stay or which routes you\r\nfollow, it is advisable to be well supplied with color film.\r\n\r\nSome of the view points and overlooks have displays or signs to help\r\ninterpret the scenic features, and more of these aids are added from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nThere are three maps in this report (figs. 3, 8, 26); these maps will be\r\nhelpful to anyone touring the Monument. Figure 3 shows streams, highways\r\nand roads, principal trails, named features, overlooks, and trip-guide\r\nlocations; figure 8 is a geologic map; and figure 26 shows localities\r\nwhere most of the photographs were taken. In addition, topographic maps\r\nof the Monument and adjacent areas by the U.S. Geological Survey, scale\r\n1:24,000, are available from several sources and are a considerable aid\r\nto visitors. In addition to cultural and drainage features, such maps\r\nshow the exact shape of the land by means of contour lines, which are\r\nlevel lines that go in and out of canyons, around ridges, and so forth.\r\nA special map of the Colorado National Monument quadrangle is available\r\nalso in a shaded relief edition, which gives a three dimensional effect\r\nby proper shading of canyons and ridges. Both types of maps are for sale\r\nat the Visitor Center, and these and adjacent quadrangles, such as the\r\nGrand Junction, Fruita, Glade Park, and Island Mesa, are sold at several\r\nengineering and stationery stores in Grand Junction and at the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey’s Map Distribution Office, Building 41, Federal\r\nCenter, Denver, Colorado, 80225. The latter office and the Visitor\r\nCenter also sell copies of my “Geologic Map of the Grand Junction area,\r\nColorado,” published in 1963 as Miscellaneous Investigations Map I-404.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               Trips Through and Around the Monument[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n  From Grand Junction through the Redlands to the West Entrance of the\r\n                                Monument\r\n\r\n\r\n  STARTING POINT\r\n\r\n                                                          [Mile-marker 1]\r\n\r\nWe will begin our trip in the southwestern part of Grand Junction at the\r\nintersection of First Street and Grand Avenue, (this is also the\r\nintersection of U.S. Highways 6 and 50 and Colorado Highway 340), by\r\nfollowing a sign on Highway 340 pointing westward toward the Monument.\r\nAfter crossing a viaduct over the railroad yards and a bridge across the\r\nColorado River, we come to a traffic light and a sign pointing left\r\ntoward the Monument. The road to the left connects with Monument Road\r\nwhich leads up No Thoroughfare Canyon to the East Entrance. However, we\r\nwill continue westward toward The Redlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REDLANDS CANAL\r\n\r\n                                                          [Mile-marker 2]\r\n\r\nJust beyond the stoplight we cross a bridge over the Redlands Power\r\nCanal which carries 675 cubic feet per second (cfs, or ft³s⁻¹)[35] from\r\nthe Redlands Diversion Dam on the Gunnison River about 2½ miles south of\r\nGrand Junction. A quarter of a mile northwest of the bridge, most of the\r\nwater falls to a lower powerplant that generates electricity for pumping\r\nthe remaining 50 cfs to three lift canals, which are used mainly for\r\nirrigating peach orchards in the eastern part of The Redlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUTH BROADWAY\r\n\r\n                                                          [Mile-marker 3]\r\n\r\nAfter Colorado Highway 340 curves right it is known as Broadway—a paved\r\nroad serving much of The Redlands and connecting with the West Entrance\r\nof the Monument. We will follow Broadway about 3 miles, passing low\r\noutcrops and roadcuts of the Dakota Sandstone, some of which contain\r\ncoal beds and some of which are covered by a veneer of gravel laid down\r\nby the river when the channel was higher. Then, at the first store and\r\nfilling station we turn southwest on another paved road known as South\r\nBroadway.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUTH CAMP ROAD SIDE TRIP\r\n\r\n                                                          [Mile-marker 4]\r\n\r\nJust around the curve to the right is a T-intersection from which paved\r\nSouth Camp Road leads south to a growing suburban area; and 2½ miles to\r\nthe southeast it connects with Monument Road at a point only half a mile\r\nnorth of the East Entrance of the Monument.\r\n\r\nExcellent views of the cliffs of dark Proterozoic rocks, the overlying\r\ncliffs of the Wingate Sandstone, and the Redlands fault along the\r\nnortheastern border of the Monument are seen all along South Broadway,\r\nbut views from South Camp Road and several connecting roads to the\r\nsouthwest are especially good. (See figs. 37 and 38.) As noted earlier,\r\nthe Redlands fault has a maximum vertical displacement of 700 or 800\r\nfeet, but dies out in scissors fashion at each end.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REDLANDS FAULT, looking west from South Camp Road\r\n    about one mile south of South Broadway.

Just above the deep cut on the right four-tenths of a mile\r\nwest of the intersection with South Camp Road is a bronze plaque set in\r\na masonry monument, whose lettering is easily readable in figure 39.\r\nMany years after the excavation in 1900 (fig. 22), Elmer Riggs contacted\r\nAl Look, of Grand Junction, in regard to the casting and erection of\r\nthis plaque. Al, Elmer, Ed Faber, and a few other citizens put up the\r\nnecessary funds and personally erected the plaque and monument. Somehow\r\nor other, _Brachiosaurus_ was misspelled _Brachyosaurus_, as shown in\r\nfigure 39, but the intentions were good. Later I will call attention to\r\nanother similar monument commemorating the finding by Riggs of another\r\ndinosaur skeleton.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CLOSEUP OF UPDRAGGED WINGATE SANDSTONE ALONG REDLANDS\r\n    FAULT, looking northwest from side road 1½ miles southwest of\r\n    intersection of South Camp Road and South Broadway.

The 7-foot\r\nchain-link fence just to the left of the road is the northeastern\r\nboundary of the Monument and encloses the herd of buffalo. In the late\r\nforties or early fifties a young bull challenged the older leader for\r\npossession of the herd and gored and pounded the old bull so badly he\r\nhad to be shot by a ranger. During the furious battle 125 feet of this\r\nstrong steel fence was utterly demolished. It is reported that sometimes\r\nan old bull simply takes one look at the young challenger and retreats\r\nwithout a battle, but other lone or rogue bulls may temporarily or\r\npermanently leave the herd for other reasons. Such outcasts are\r\ndangerous and unpredictable. One bull kept a ranger “treed” for 4 hours\r\non a steep rock ledge in the broiling sun before moving on to a patch of\r\ngrass. Four of these critters delayed by one week my walking out a\r\nstretch of the Redlands fault on their side of the fence.

Good views of\r\nthe fault are seen all along the fence, but especially at points\r\none-tenth and four-tenths of a mile northwest of the first turn, the\r\nsecond of which is shown in figure 40. Just after turning north on South\r\nBroadway, let us turn west a few hundred feet on paved Wingate Drive to\r\nsee the northwest end of the Redlands fault, which passes through a col\r\nto the left of updragged remnants of the thinned red Chinle Formation\r\nand the Wingate Sandstone, as shown in figure 41.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REVERSE PART OF REDLANDS FAULT, looking N. 65° W.\r\n    from point on South Broadway along boundary fence. Most of Chinle\r\n    Formation has been squeezed out, but lower part of Wingate Sandstone\r\n    may be seen dipping about 45° southwestward beneath dark Proterozoic\r\n    rocks. Next pink band to right is Entrada Sandstone. Jumbled mass of\r\n    white sandstone slabs at right of photograph is part of Salt Wash\r\n    Member of Morrison Formation and is known locally as “White Rock”.\r\n    (Fig. 40)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NORTHWEST END OF REDLANDS FAULT, passing through col\r\n    to left of updragged remnants of Chinle Formation and Wingate\r\n    Sandstone. Fault, which here is normal, ends against unbroken Lizard\r\n    Canyon monocline in next canyon to northwest. Looking west from\r\n    point just south of Wingate Drive a few hundred feet west of South\r\n    Broadway. (Fig. 41)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  MONUMENT CANYON TRAIL\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile north of the last turn, South Broadway rejoins\r\nBroadway (Colo. Highway 340) at a stop sign. After we turn left on\r\nBroadway and reach the first curve, we get a nice view westward into\r\nMonument Canyon, as shown in figure 42. The Park Service hopes to\r\nestablish a new trailhead at the bridge one-tenth of a mile west of the\r\ncurve, from which a new section of trail will follow the normally dry\r\nwash southwestward to join the old Monument Canyon Trail. After we cross\r\nthe creek leaving the canyon, we pass a low hill of the Salt Wash Member\r\nof the Morrison Formation on the left. Just beyond the hill, the dirt\r\nroad leading southwest to a farmhouse formerly was the beginning of the\r\nMonument Canyon Trail (fig. 3). There is a new temporary trailhead a\r\nquarter of a mile north, but it is hoped that a permanent one can be\r\nbuilt at the bridge about a quarter of a mile to the southeast, as noted\r\nabove. Hikers may see buffalo along this trail and should watch out for\r\noutcast bulls.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING WEST INTO MONUMENT CANYON, from curve on\r\n    Broadway just northwest of end of South Broadway, showing\r\n    Independence Monument. This monument was seen in figure 6 and will\r\n    be seen again in figure 51. Redlands fault ends in this canyon;\r\n    Lizard Canyon monocline can be seen on extreme right. (Fig. 42)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  DRAINAGE DIVIDE\r\n\r\n                                                          [Mile-marker 8]\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile north of the farm road we reach the highest point on\r\nBroadway (Colo. 340) at a drainage divide. Inasmuch as the three\r\nRedlands Lift Canals end east of the divide, there is quite a contrast\r\nbetween the lush irrigated lands east of the divide and the nearly\r\nbarren desert to the west, a view of which is shown in figure 43. To the\r\nsouthwest of the divide is an excellent view of the\r\nnortheastward-dipping beds on the Lizard Canyon monocline. On the left\r\nabout a mile northwest of the divide we pass the other entrance of\r\nMonument Canyon, then Lizard Canyon, and a switchback on Rim Rock Drive\r\nascending the ridge between Lizard and Fruita Canyons. The water well\r\nbeneath elevated tank on left is 650 feet deep and formerly flowed at\r\nabout half a gallon a minute from the Wingate Sandstone. Household needs\r\nare obtained by pumping.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING WEST FROM DIVIDE ON BROADWAY 2 MILES EAST OF\r\n    WEST ENTRANCE TO MONUMENT. Monoclinal hill on right is Brushy Basin\r\n    Member of Morrison Formation capped by basal beds of Burro Canyon\r\n    Formation. Rocks at left middle are blocks of sandstone in the Salt\r\n    Wash Member of the Morrison. (Fig. 43)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ROAD INTERSECTION\r\n\r\nAt the next intersection, Colorado Highway 340 turns right and continues\r\nabout 2½ miles to Fruita; the highway to the left reaches the West\r\nEntrance of the Monument in a quarter of a mile. Before turning left\r\ninto the Monument, however, we will interrupt our description of the\r\ntrip by making a new start from Fruita for the benefit of people\r\ntravelling from this direction.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bison]\r\n\r\n\r\n            From Fruita to the West Entrance of the Monument\r\n\r\n\r\n  MORRISON FORMATION\r\n\r\n                                                          [Mile-marker 9]\r\n\r\nFrom the Fruita interchange on I-70, the overpass leads north into the\r\ntown of Fruita, and Colorado Highway 340 leads south about 2½ miles to\r\nthe West Entrance of Colorado National Monument. One mile south we cross\r\nthe new bridge over the Colorado River; the old bridge formerly\r\nconnecting Fruita with the Monument may be seen half a mile upstream.\r\nJust south of the new bridge we see sandstone on the left and green\r\nshale on the right, both part of the Burro Canyon Formation. The high\r\nhill on the left is made up of brightly colored siltstones and mudstones\r\nof the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation capped by the basal\r\nsandstone of the Burro Canyon Formation. On the southeast side of this\r\nhill is another bronze plaque set in a masonry monument, similar to the\r\none at Riggs Hill (fig. 39), commemorating the discovery and removal in\r\n1900 by Elmer S. Riggs of a skeleton of the immense dinosaur\r\n_Apatosaurus excelcus_ Marsh. (See figure 23_B_). About 1¾ miles\r\nnorthwest of the new bridge is the Fruita Paleontological area discussed\r\non page 50.\r\n\r\nJust south of the hill, the highway curves gently to the left across a\r\nrelatively flat surface of the Morrison Formation. To the right may be\r\nseen good exposures of the Entrada Sandstone, at the north end of which\r\ncurbstones were quarried from thin beds of the white Moab Member for use\r\nin some of the parking areas along Rim Rock Drive. Some of the beds are\r\nripple marked[36] from wave action along ancient beaches or within\r\nancient lagoons. Some ripple-marked curbstones from this quarry may be\r\nseen in the parking area at Red Canyon Overlook, and elsewhere in the\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the Monument we see that to the left the rock strata are\r\nbent downward toward us along what geologists call a monocline (see\r\nfigs. 27 and 30), but to the right may be seen cliffs of dark\r\nProterozoic rocks surmounted by slopes of the red Chinle Formation and\r\ncliffs of the buff Wingate Sandstone capped by the lowermost beds of the\r\nresistant Kayenta Formation. The bent and broken rocks ahead are well\r\nshown in figure 33.\r\n\r\nAbout 1½ miles south of the Colorado River we reach the T-intersection\r\nnoted previously—at the end of the trip from Grand Junction through The\r\nRedlands to the West Entrance of the Monument—and we are ready for our\r\ntrip through the Monument.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Through the Monument from West to East Entrances\r\n\r\n\r\n  WEST ENTRANCE\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 10]\r\n\r\nAfter turning south on Rim Rock Drive from the intersection with\r\nColorado Highway 340 (Broadway), we cross the Monument’s northern\r\nboundary and reach the checking station at the West Entrance, where a\r\nsmall entry fee is charged during the summer. At the first left turn we\r\nare in red beds of the Chinle Formation, then in sheared and broken beds\r\nof the Wingate Sandstone along the Kodels Canyon fault. At the\r\neasternmost loop of the road we may look southeastward across Lizard\r\nCanyon to the Lizard Canyon monocline (fig. 30), and if we look down the\r\nslope to the east we will see one of John Otto’s well-built trails that\r\nformerly ascended the west side of Lizard Canyon to what is now the\r\ncampground, long before Rim Rock Drive was built. Do not try to stop at\r\nthe curve, however; play it safe, drive on, and park at Redlands View a\r\nquarter of a mile west.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REDLANDS VIEW\r\n\r\nBy walking about 50 feet north of the turnout, we get an excellent view\r\nto the west of the Kodels Canyon fault, as shown in figure 31. Just to\r\nthe north of the fault are the sheared and broken beds of the Wingate\r\nSandstone along the east end of this fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW EARTHFILL\r\n\r\nJust beyond the turnout the road curves left through a cut in the\r\nWingate Sandstone and ascends the east side of Fruita Canyon. About a\r\nquarter of a mile from the parking area we get a good view (fig. 44) to\r\nthe west of the new earthfill on Rim Rock Drive between the two tunnels.\r\nThe original fill was washed out in a few minutes on August 8, 1968, by\r\na cloudburst that dumped an estimated 4 inches of rain on the mesa west\r\nof Fruita Canyon. A culvert beneath the road just north of the north\r\ntunnel was wholly unable to cope with the resulting flood, part of which\r\nplunged over the cliff but most of which roared southward through the\r\ntunnel. According to the only known eyewitnesses—a couple from Ohio\r\nwhose car was stalled in 18 inches of swift water in the lower tunnel—an\r\nestimated 4 feet of water flowing through the north tunnel soon\r\nseparated the two tunnels by a gaping chasm and flowed down where the\r\nfill had been but moments earlier. They jockeyed their car back and\r\nforth in the south tunnel and retraced the route back toward Fruita.\r\nLater I viewed the chasm from the portal of the north tunnel and found\r\nit awesome indeed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEW FILL ON RIM ROCK DRIVE BETWEEN TWO TUNNELS ON\r\n    WEST SIDE OF FRUITA CANYON, looking west from east side of canyon.\r\n    Previous fill was washed out by flash flood, as described in text.\r\n    (Fig. 44)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\nThe road remained closed for 1½ years until December 20, 1969, much to\r\nthe annoyance and discomfort of both visitors and Monument\r\npersonnel—particularly the latter. During the summer, the usual 16-mile\r\ndaily round trip to the post office in Fruita via the West Entrance was\r\nincreased to about 80 miles by way of the East Entrance. During the\r\nschool season, wives of Monument personnel took turns driving a station\r\nwagon full of children on two daily round trips to the schools and post\r\noffice in Fruita. Note in figure 44, taken only 6½ years after the road\r\nwas reopened, that small gullies already have been cut in the lower half\r\nof the new fill. Another local cloudburst could remove the new fill, but\r\nlet us hope this does not happen!\r\n\r\nOn the next curve to the east the road cuts entirely through the red\r\nChinle Formation, which here has a measured thickness of 103 feet.[37]\r\nFrom the base of the Chinle to about the creek crossing the road cuts\r\nexpose the old Proterozoic metamorphic rocks, which here have a purple\r\nhue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BALANCED ROCK\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 11]\r\n\r\nAt the southernmost loop of the road is a parking area for viewing\r\nBalanced Rock. The photograph for the frontispiece was taken from the\r\nhillside near the foot of the monolith.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HISTORIC TRAILS VIEW\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 12]\r\n\r\nAfter the road turns north, we again cross the entire Chinle Formation,\r\nthen penetrate the Wingate Sandstone through the two tunnels (turn on\r\nyour lights) shown on all the maps and in figures 33 and 44. Just beyond\r\nthe highest tunnel (turn off your lights) we reach Historic Trails View,\r\nwith a sign noting the early expeditions that traversed the area. West\r\nfrom the parking area, but better yet by walking to the westernmost\r\ncurve, may be seen the northern part of the Black Ridge Trail.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FRUITA CANYON, looking northeast from point on Rim\r\n    Rock Drive above head of canyon. Dark Proterozoic rocks floor the\r\n    canyon, above which are the slopes of the red Chinle Formation and\r\n    the cliffs of Wingate Sandstone capped by the lower resistant beds\r\n    of the Kayenta Formation. Beyond the Grand Valley are the dark Book\r\n    Cliffs and the more distant, light-colored Roan Cliffs, which are\r\n    shown more clearly in figure 48. (Fig. 45)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FRUITA CANYON VIEW\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 13]\r\n\r\nThis foot trail is part of the old stock trail over which sheep and\r\ncattle once were driven down to the Grand Valley from Glade Park and\r\nPiñon Mesa. The road then winds upward through a series of switchbacks\r\ncut into the Kayenta Formation to Distant View and then to a parking\r\nspot at the relatively new Fruita Canyon View, which affords a splendid\r\nview of Fruita Canyon. Figure 45 was taken from a point about a tenth of\r\na mile to the east. On the right are housing facilities for Monument\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAMPGROUND AND PICNIC AREA\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 14]\r\n\r\nAt the top of the hill just beyond the head of Fruita Canyon, two roads\r\nturn left; the first makes several loops through the modern campground\r\nand picnic area then returns to Rim Rock Drive; the second enters a\r\nlarge parking lot at the Visitor Center. Let us take the first road,\r\nthen turn sharp to the left again just west of the Saddlehorn and\r\nexplore the camp and picnic areas, which are on a gently sloping mesa of\r\nthe Kayenta Formation dotted with piñon and juniper trees and bushes of\r\nmany kinds. The Saddlehorn is an erosional remnant of the Entrada\r\nSandstone. (See fig. 50.) The deluxe campground has both drive-through\r\nand back-in campsites, modern restrooms, tables, piped water, and\r\ngrills. Two of the drive-through sites on the northernmost loop are\r\nshown in figure 46.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CAMPSITES AT NORTH END OF CAMPGROUND, Grand Valley\r\n    and Book Cliffs beyond. (Fig. 46)]\r\n\r\nA view of the picnic area and parking lot is shown in figure 47. During\r\nthe summer, evening slide talks are given by rangers at a small\r\namphitheater just north of the Saddlehorn and to the left of the view\r\nshown in figure 47.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WINDOW ROCK\r\n\r\nAn interesting quarter-of-a-mile self-guiding Window Rock Nature Trail\r\nleads from the northeast corner of the campground to Window Rock and\r\nloops back past Book Cliffs View, which contains a table beneath a\r\nramada. Window Rock Trail connects with the scenic Canyon Rim Trail,\r\nwhich leads southwestward to the Visitor Center. Views of Window Rock\r\nand Monument Canyon from Canyon Rim Trail are shown in figures 48 and\r\n49.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PICNIC AREA AND PARKING LOT, looking northeast from\r\n    top of the Saddlehorn. Large groups can be accommodated by making\r\n    advance reservations. Cliff of Wingate Sandstone on right across\r\n    Monument Canyon is part of Lizard Canyon monocline. (See fig. 29.)\r\n    (Fig. 47)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VISITOR CENTER—MONUMENT HEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\nAfter we return to Rim Rock Drive, a double left turn brings us to a\r\nlarge parking lot. We are now at the Visitor Center and Monument\r\nHeadquarters, which is well worth a visit. In the front of the building\r\nare modern restrooms and a drinking fountain. Inside the lobby may be\r\npurchased film, slides, post cards, maps, booklets, and reports. A\r\nnarrated slide show and museum help materially in conveying just what\r\nthe Monument has to offer. I was pleased at being asked to contribute\r\nseveral of the geologic exhibits, partly with the aid of former Survey\r\nartist John R. Stacy. From the back door a path leads to a fenced\r\noverlook for viewing an arm of Monument Canyon. The overlook also is the\r\nbeginning of Canyon Rim Trail which connects about half a mile to the\r\nnortheast with Window Rock Trail at Book Cliff View.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WINDOW ROCK, a window eroded along a vertical joint\r\n    near the top of the Wingate Sandstone. Telephoto view looking\r\n    northeast from Canyon Rim Trail. Note fenced overlook on Kayenta\r\n    Formation to left of window to keep people from crossing joint above\r\n    window, for someday the monolith to the right will fall, as did\r\n    Fallen Rock (fig. 35). Note light-colored Roan Cliffs of Green River\r\n    Formation beyond Book Cliffs.

But do not worry, it is well protected by a rock wall. At the\r\nhead of the canyon is a large jumbled landslide of the Morrison\r\nFormation that has covered the cliff of Entrada Sandstone. Along the\r\nnarrow stretch and just beyond the landslide are excellent views on the\r\nright of the erosional unconformity between the eroded surface of the\r\nKayenta Formation and the overlying Slick Rock Member of the Entrada\r\nSandstone, a view of which is shown in figure 15 and a discussion of\r\nwhich is given on pages 35 to 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PIPE ORGAN\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 16]\r\n\r\nFrom the next parking area to the northeast at Pipe Organ Overlook we\r\nmay hike half a mile over Otto’s Trail to an overlook of the Pipe Organ;\r\na view of the Pipe Organ from the northwest is shown in figure 49. From\r\nabout the middle of this trail we may look to the northwest across the\r\ncanyon to the Visitor Center and the Saddlehorn (fig. 50).\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEPENDENCE VIEW\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 17]\r\n\r\nAt the next parking area at Independence View we see Independence\r\nMonument (fig. 51) from quite a different angle than the photograph\r\nshown in figure 6. This view clearly shows it to be a thin erosional\r\nremnant of a narrow wall that once connected mesas to the northeast and\r\nsouthwest and which separated the two entrances of Monument Canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GRAND VIEW\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 18]\r\n\r\nGrand View, six-tenths of a mile farther southeast, affords excellent\r\nviews of several features in and near Monument Canyon. A short improved\r\ntrail to the northeast leads to a sandstone ledge from which the\r\ninfrared photograph for the front cover was taken. The trail then veers\r\neastward to a fenced cliff-top viewpoint from which one may look nearly\r\nstraight down to a stretch of Monument Canyon Trail. You may see hikers\r\non the trail or buffalo in the canyon. The photograph for figure 6 was\r\ntaken from a point just north of the north end of the parking area.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MONUMENT CANYON VIEW\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 19]\r\n\r\nAnother 1⅓ miles takes us to the next parking area at Monument Canyon\r\nView, from which one may walk a short distance to the northeast. The\r\nphotograph shown in figure 13 was taken from a point northeast of the\r\nparking area.\r\n\r\nFrom the head of Fruita Canyon to Monument Canyon View, Rim Rock Drive\r\nis on a bench of the Kayenta Formation that separates the two lines of\r\ncliffs. We must now leave this bench, however, because from near Coke\r\nOvens Overlook to beyond Artists Point the bench ceases to exist, and\r\nthe Entrada, Kayenta, and Wingate form virtually a single cliff.\r\nMoreover, we must get up into the Morrison Formation in order to cross\r\nthe divide between Monument and Ute Canyons. For these reasons, in the\r\nnext three-quarters of a mile south of Monument Canyon View the road\r\ncuts upward through the entire Entrada Sandstone. Just beyond the first\r\ncurve are quarries on the right from which curb and building stones were\r\ncut by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930’s for protecting\r\noverlooks and narrow stretches of road. At the southwest end of this\r\nstretch is another parking area at Coke Ovens Overlook, which provides\r\ngood views of the north side of the Coke Ovens.\r\n\r\n\r\n  COKE OVENS OVERLOOK\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 20]\r\n\r\nThe next parking area a quarter of a mile to the southwest is the\r\nMonument Canyon Trailhead of the long trail to the mouth of Monument\r\nCanyon and of a short trail to the Coke Ovens.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ARTISTS POINT\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 21]\r\n\r\nHalf a mile to the southeast takes us to a large parking area at Artists\r\nPoint, which offers a wide variety of scenic views. The best exposure of\r\nthe Summerville Formation in the entire area that I mapped[38] is on the\r\nwest side of the road, as shown in figure 20. A short trail leads down\r\nto a fenced overlook for viewing the Coke Ovens to the north (fig. 11)\r\nand Monument Canyon to the northeast.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VISITOR CENTER AND THE SADDLEHORN, looking northwest\r\n    across canyon from Otto’s Trail. Note thin-bedded bench of the\r\n    Kayenta Formation separating cliffs of the Entrada Sandstone above\r\n    the Wingate Sandstone below.

In the next three-quarters of a mile to Highland View the\r\nroadcuts are in the sandstone ledges of the Salt Wash Member of the\r\nMorrison Formation. Another half a mile through massive Salt Wash\r\nsandstones takes us to the second highest point on Rim Rock Drive—the\r\ndivide between Monument and Ute Canyons, altitude 6,593 feet. From here\r\nwe may look far to the south across Glade Park to high Piñon Mesa—the\r\nhighest part of the Uncompahgre Plateau northwest of Unaweep Canyon,\r\nwhere the altitude is about 9,500 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LIBERTY CAP TRAILHEAD\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 23]\r\n\r\nHalfway down the hill to the south is a parking area on the left at the\r\nhead of Liberty Cap Trail, which goes eastward about 6 miles to Liberty\r\nCap—a prominent conical point atop the Wingate cliff just west of the\r\nmouth of Ute Canyon, which appears on the left skyline of figure 38.\r\nFrom there, the trail descends about 2 miles to a gate in the boundary\r\nfence at the mouth of Ute Canyon. The roads connecting the gate with\r\nSouth Camp Road (fig. 3) were reported (1979) to be closed to foot\r\ntravel by private landowners, so hikers reaching this point must either\r\nretrace their steps to the parking area at the head of the Liberty Cap\r\ntrail, or return by a primitive trail up main Ute Canyon, turn right up\r\nthe west arm of the canyon, and regain Rim Rock Drive by a short\r\nswitchback trail noted on page 109. However, the Park Service hopes that\r\nin the future some sort of corridor can be established to connect the\r\ntrailhead with the nearby roads. Most of the “trail” up Ute Canyon is\r\nthe normally dry channel of the creek, so hikers should watch out for\r\nflash floods. The round trip by Liberty Cap Trail alone is about 16\r\nmiles, and if the return trip is made by Ute Canyon the total distance\r\nis about 13 miles. Accordingly, hikers should allow a full day and carry\r\nfood and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GLADE PARK ROAD\r\n\r\nA quarter of a mile west of the Liberty Cap parking area in the west arm\r\nof Ute Canyon is a junction with a gravel road that leads 5 miles south\r\nto the Glade Park General Store and Post Office, where groceries, beer,\r\ngasoline, and fishing and camping supplies are available. Glade Park\r\nconnects with scenic roads leading east, west, and south. Later, we will\r\ncover in more detail a round trip from the intersection in Ute Canyon to\r\none near Cold Shivers Point, and another round trip from Glade Park\r\naround the head of No Thoroughfare Canyon and back to Grand Junction via\r\nthe Little Park Road.\r\n\r\nBut to continue with the trip through the Monument—from the intersection\r\nwith the gravel road to Glade Park, Rim Rock Drive turns abruptly to the\r\nsoutheast and follows the west arm of Ute Canyon for some 3 or 4 miles,\r\npast many interesting points. For the next 1⅓ miles to the first\r\nculvert, which crosses a large tributary, the roadcuts are in the\r\nSummerville Formation and Entrada Sandstone. The photographs in figures\r\n16 and 17 were taken looking north from the culvert and from just\r\nnorthwest of the culvert, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FLOOD\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 24]\r\n\r\nOne day when my family and I were approaching the culvert from the west,\r\nwe heard a roar like an express train. Looking to the south we saw that\r\na severe thundershower was occurring on the headwaters in Glade Park, so\r\nwe raced ahead and parked east of the culvert just in time to see and\r\nhear a 4-foot wall of red water come roaring down the tributary, rolling\r\nboulders along as if they were basketballs. Unfortunately, we had no\r\ntime to ready or use a camera, so we simply raced down the road\r\nembankment and through the trees and brush to the north in time to see\r\nthe flood plunge eastward over a 350-foot cliff of the Wingate Sandstone\r\nto the canyon below. This illustrates the need for caution when\r\nfollowing or crossing “dry” washes in the desert in stormy weather or\r\nwhen there are storms in the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  UPPER UTE CANYON VIEW\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 25]\r\n\r\nAbout two-tenths of a mile northeast of the culvert is Upper Ute Canyon\r\nView, which affords good views of the northeast cliff face of the west\r\narm of Ute Canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FALLEN ROCK OVERLOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n  UTE CANYON TRAILHEAD\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 26]\r\n\r\nFor the next 7½ miles Rim Rock Drive is once again on a bench of the\r\nKayenta Formation between cliffs of the Entrada and Wingate Sandstones.\r\nFrom Upper Ute Canyon View the road goes southeastward along the canyon\r\nrim about three-tenths of a mile to a parking area. A short trail leads\r\ndown from the parking area to fenced Fallen Rock Overlook; the view\r\nshown in figure 35 is from this point. As noted in the caption of figure\r\n35, and on page 108, the Ute Canyon Trail zigzags down the slope from\r\nthe road a quarter of a mile southeast of the parking area, but there is\r\nno parking area at the trailhead, so it is safer to park at Fallen Rock\r\nOverlook and walk to the trailhead. The connection with this trail and\r\nthe Liberty Cap Trail also is discussed on page 108. On one hike down\r\nthis trail we saw two elk, which is a rare sight at such a low altitude,\r\nfor they generally stay on or near Piñon Mesa.\r\n\r\n\r\n  UTE CANYON\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 27]\r\n\r\nAbout a mile to the southeast, just beyond the steep dropoff on the\r\nleft, there is room to park, walk a short distance through the trees to\r\nthe east, and observe a fine view of main Ute Canyon, as shown in figure\r\n52. Just beyond on our right are the cliffs of the mottled\r\nsalmon-and-white Slick Rock Member overlain by the all white Moab\r\nMember, as shown in figure 18 and described in the accompanying text.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile southeast, where the road makes a gentle U-turn and\r\ncontinues northeastward, we reach the highest point on Rim Rock Drive at\r\nan altitude of about 6,640 feet. Note that the piñon and juniper are\r\nlarger, and the bushes are larger and greener at this altitude, for the\r\naverage precipitation increases as we go higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LOWER UTE CANYON VIEW\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 28]\r\n\r\nAbout a mile northeast of the highest point on the road is a large\r\nparking area on the left, from which a short, shaded trail leads to a\r\nfenced overlook called Lower Ute Canyon View, which faces the northwest\r\narm of Ute Canyon across the main canyon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: UTE CANYON, looking northeast from point described in\r\n    text. Note grass-covered alluvium in distant part of canyon floor.\r\n    (Fig. 52)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  RED CANYON OVERLOOK\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 29]\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile beyond this parking area, we reach a small parking\r\narea at Red Canyon Overlook, from which the photograph shown in figure\r\n12 was taken. The dark green bush of Mormon Tea in the right foreground\r\nof figure 12 is one of the largest I have seen in the Monument. The\r\nreasons for the differences between the left and right walls of the\r\ncanyon are discussed on pages 79 and 80. The ripple-marked curbstones of\r\nwhite sandstone in the parking area were quarried from the Moab Member\r\nof the Entrada Sandstone northwest of Fruita Canyon, as noted on page\r\n96.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DS ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n  COLD SHIVERS POINT\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 30]\r\n\r\nAnother 2½ miles around the south rim of Red Canyon and the head of\r\nColumbus Canyon takes us to the junction with the paved county road\r\nknown as the DS Road, which leads south and southwest to Glade Park and\r\nto the head of No Thoroughfare Canyon. This important intersection will\r\nbe included in trips through Glade Park and around the head of No\r\nThoroughfare Canyon, so it will be discussed later. Meanwhile, we will\r\ncontinue our trip eastward from this intersection. About a third of a\r\nmile to the northeast is a large parking area, with a path leading to a\r\nfenced overlook at the rim of Columbus Canyon for viewing Cold Shivers\r\nPoint—perhaps the most aptly titled feature in the Monument (fig. 53). A\r\nprimitive path leads from the overlook to the toadstool-shaped platform\r\nat upper right, on which some visitors dare to stand, but not me. When\r\nthe old, steep Serpents Trail was the only route for autos to ascend\r\nfrom the East Entrance, barrels of water were kept at this parking area\r\nto quench the thirst of boiling radiators.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HEAD OF SERPENTS TRAIL\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 31]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the parking area, the downgrade on the Kayenta Formation\r\nbegins to steepen to the northeast until it becomes advisable to shift\r\ninto second gear. In about half a mile we descend a series of steep\r\nswitchbacks cut into the Wingate Sandstone on the steepening Ladder\r\nCreek monocline (figs. 8, 29), and we reach the present upper end of the\r\nold Serpents Trail (fig. 54), which is now an interesting foot trail. As\r\nnoted earlier, it is convenient to hike down this steep 2½-mile trail\r\nand to have one member of the party drive ahead and await the hikers at\r\nthe parking area in the Devils Kitchen Picnic Area, near the foot of the\r\ntrail. One of many rewarding views seen during the hike is shown in\r\nfigure 55, another was seen in figure 10.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COLD SHIVERS POINT, looking north from fenced\r\n    overlook on east edge of Columbus Canyon. Named feature is\r\n    toadstool-shaped rock at upper right. Note dark Proterozoic rocks in\r\n    canyon bottom. (Fig. 53)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TOP OF OLD SERPENTS TRAIL, looking northeast from\r\n    switchbacks above tunnel. Top of trail is seen at sign on lower\r\n    right. Grand Mesa forms right skyline. (Fig. 54)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING NORTHEAST FROM OLD SERPENTS TRAIL, before\r\n    1950 when the trail was still used by autos and trucks. One of John\r\n    Otto’s old foot trails joins the old road at lower middle. Although\r\n    no thick lenses of sandstone appear in the Salt Wash Member of the\r\n    Morrison Formation in figure 21, in this view a lens about 50 feet\r\n    thick begins just around the corner near the base of the high bluff\r\n    across No Thoroughfare Canyon and is seen extending as far to the\r\n    left as the normally dry wash that drains the canyon. When water\r\n    flows down the wash after thundershowers (see p. 118) or from\r\n    melting snow, the sandstone lens takes in water (recharge) which\r\n    moves slowly down the dip of the lens to the northeast and supplies\r\n    several artesian wells. In turn, the light band of the Entrada\r\n    Sandstone beneath the cottonwood trees at the right middle and the\r\n    dark patch of Wingate Sandstone at the extreme lower right are\r\n    recharged in like manner, and they supply water to artesian wells to\r\n    the northeast. As the older and deeper sandstones on the right take\r\n    in water at higher altitudes, the water in them is under greater\r\n    artesian head when tapped by wells. If you think you see covered\r\n    wagons near the middle of the photograph arranged in a circle for\r\n    defense against attack by Indians, you are correct—a Western movie\r\n    was about to be filmed.

(Fig. 56)]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOT OF SERPENTS TRAIL\r\n\r\nJust beyond the lowest switchback shown in figure 54, we penetrate the\r\nWingate Sandstone through a tunnel, the south portal of which is shown\r\nin figure 56. After we drive through a deep cut in the Wingate Sandstone\r\njust south of the tunnel, we cross the entire red Chinle Formation, then\r\ndescend a series of switchbacks in old Proterozoic rocks. The Chinle\r\nFormation is crossed again near the foot of the hill, where it is about\r\n80 feet thick,[39] then we recross the Wingate Sandstone and Kayenta\r\nFormation to the parking area in the Devils Kitchen Picnic Area, near\r\nthe foot of the old Serpents Trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEVILS KITCHEN\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 32]\r\n\r\nAn improved marked trail leads southward from parking area at the foot\r\nof the Serpents Trail, crosses No Thoroughfare Canyon, and continues as\r\nan unimproved trail to the Devils Kitchen, a view of which is shown in\r\nfigure 57. The petroglyphs shown in figure 4 are northeast of this\r\nparking area. Those interested in seeing them should inquire at the\r\nranger station or checking station at the East Entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  EAST ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nJust beyond the parking area, near the foot of the old Serpents Trail, a\r\nroad turns left to a larger parking area for the Devils Kitchen Picnic\r\nArea, where covered tables, grills, and water are available. Just beyond\r\nwe pass the checking station and housing facilities for Monument\r\npersonnel at the East Entrance of the Monument. During the summer, fees\r\nare collected at this checking station from persons entering the\r\nMonument. A well just east of the housing area obtains water from the\r\nEntrada Sandstone to supply the houses and picnic area.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DEVILS KITCHEN, looking north from ridge in middle of\r\n    No Thoroughfare Canyon.

(Fig.\r\n    57)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                From the East Entrance to Grand Junction\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUTH CAMP ROAD SHORTCUT\r\n\r\nThree fourths of a mile beyond the checking station, South Camp Road\r\nturns left and joins South Broadway 2½ miles to the northwest. This\r\nprovides a fine shortcut for persons desirous of travelling back\r\nnorthwestward through The Redlands to regain the West Entrance of the\r\nMonument. The intersection of South Camp Road and South Broadway, a key\r\npoint on the trip “From Grand Junction through The Redlands to the West\r\nEntrance of the Monument,” is noted on page 89.\r\n\r\nBut let us continue our 3-mile return trip to Grand Junction, in order\r\nto point out several things of interest along Monument Road in the lower\r\npart of No Thoroughfare Canyon. As the canyon narrows just beyond the\r\nroad intersection, we see on both sides colorful badlands of the\r\nMorrison Formation capped by the rusty looking basal sandstones of the\r\nBurro Canyon Formation. Behind the building on the right just before the\r\nroad curves to the left is an artesian well 575 feet deep that taps both\r\nthe Entrada Sandstone and a sandstone lens in the Morrison\r\nFormation[40].\r\n\r\n\r\n  GAP IN ROCK RECORD\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 33]\r\n\r\nAbout 2½ miles below the checking station, we pass on the left the basal\r\nsandstone of the Burro Canyon Formation resting on the Morrison\r\nFormation, as shown in the lower left of figure 24. Just beyond we may\r\nlook up the hill to the left and see the 40-foot basal conglomerate of\r\nthe Dakota Sandstone resting unconformably on an old erosion surface\r\natop the Burro Canyon Formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FLOOD DAMAGE\r\n\r\nJust before we reach the T-intersection with the eastern segment of\r\nSouth Broadway we may still see on the right some of the destruction\r\ncaused by a devastating flood that roared down No Thoroughfare and other\r\ncanyons on September 7, 1978, as a result of what was termed the worst\r\ncloudburst to hit Glade Park, the Monument, and the Grand Valley since\r\n1958. A house on the flood plain just above the bridge was badly damaged\r\nand was filled with 4 feet of mud, and the Monument Road bridge across\r\nNo Thoroughfare Canyon nearest the intersection was washed out,\r\nnecessitating the rerouting of traffic to and from the East Entrance of\r\nthe Monument. Moral—never build a house or even pitch a tent in a dry\r\nwash or arroyo in desert regions! Incidentally, indirect measurements by\r\nengineers of the U.S. Geological Survey indicated a discharge of 9,290\r\ncfs just above the washed out bridge in No Thoroughfare Canyon, and\r\n2,980 cfs in Red Canyon beneath the Broadway bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SOUTH BROADWAY\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the bridge on Monument Road has long since been rebuilt, we\r\nwill cross it, turn right on South Broadway at the T-intersection, cross\r\nthe Redlands Power Canal (p. 88), and join Colorado Highway 340 at the\r\ntraffic light; thus, we complete a round trip “From Grand Junction\r\nthrough The Redlands to the West Entrance of the Monument,” “Through the\r\nMonument from West to East Entrances,” and “From the East Entrance to\r\nGrand Junction.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  Through Glade Park from the Northwest Arm of Ute Canyon to Columbus\r\n                                 Canyon\r\n\r\n\r\n  GLADE PARK ROAD\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 34]\r\n\r\nA very pleasant 11-mile drive through Glade Park may be made from the\r\nintersection where Rim Rock Drive crosses the northwest arm of Ute\r\nCanyon (p. 108) to the intersection with the same drive on the rim of\r\nColumbus Canyon a quarter of a mile southwest of Cold Shivers Point (p.\r\n120). The name Glade Park refers not only to the Store and Post Office\r\nmentioned earlier, but also to a nearly flat farming and ranching area\r\nsouth of the Monument—an area entirely different from the Monument or\r\nThe Redlands. Most of the cultivated part of Glade Park is underlain by\r\nnearly flat lying Entrada Sandstone which was weathered to a sandy soil,\r\nbut a few areas are underlain by the Morrison Formation. This drive\r\nshould appeal particularly to people spending from a few days to a week\r\nor more in the campground. For the more adventuresome, other interesting\r\nroads join Glade Park from several directions, as noted below.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Rim Rock Drive at Ute Canyon, on a good gravelled road, we\r\ntraverse attractive, hilly, wooded country generally southward for about\r\na mile and climb some 300 feet to a flat area covered mainly by\r\nsagebrush and grass. About 3 miles south of the intersection, we see on\r\nthe left the leached white outcrops of the Entrada Sandstone shown in\r\nfigure 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GLADE PARK\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 35]\r\n\r\nAnother 2 miles takes us to the Glade Park Store and Post Office at a\r\nfour-way intersection.\r\n\r\nAn improved, gravelled road leads westward through pleasant country some\r\n20 miles to the Utah State line, beyond which an unimproved road leads\r\neither to the Colorado or the Dolores Rivers. Future planning calls for\r\nimproving the Utah stretch of this road and for building a bridge across\r\neither the Colorado or Dolores Rivers to connect with scenic Utah\r\nHighway 128. If and when completed, this would afford a very scenic\r\nshortcut from Moab, Utah, to Grand Junction via the Little Park Road (to\r\nbe described).\r\n\r\nSouth from the four-way intersection an improved gravelled road takes us\r\nthrough wooded country, past lakes and campgrounds, to the summit of\r\nPiñon Mesa, as noted earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GLADE PARK FAULT\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 36]\r\n\r\nAlso, from the intersection a paved county road known as DS (south) Road\r\nleads eastward then northeastward through farming and ranching country 6\r\nmiles to the intersection with Rim Rock Drive near Cold Shivers Point.\r\nThree-fourths of a mile east of the Glade Park Store and Post Office the\r\nroad crosses the Glade Park fault (fig. 8) along which the Morrison and\r\nSummerville Formations on the right have dropped down with respect to\r\nthe Entrada Sandstone on the left. Here, the Entrada also has been\r\nleached to white.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LITTLE PARK ROAD\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 37]\r\n\r\nAt 1½ miles east of the Glade Park Store and Post Office is the\r\nintersection with the improved gravelled Little Park Road, which will be\r\ndescribed later. At 2¾ miles beyond this intersection, the DS Road\r\nleaves the Entrada Sandstone and is on a wooded stretch of the Kayenta\r\nFormation the remaining 2 miles to Rim Rock Drive. The last one-tenth of\r\na mile is crooked and steep, so please slow down before reaching the\r\nstop sign at the intersection. Some years ago the brakes on a pickup\r\ntruck failed as the driver approached the stop sign, but he was lucky\r\nenough to jump out at the top of the cliff just before the truck plunged\r\nto the bottom of Columbus Canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n       From Glade Park to Grand Junction Via the Little Park Road\r\n\r\n\r\n  GLADE PARK FAULT\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 38]\r\n\r\nFrom the intersection 1½ miles east of the Glade Park Store and Post\r\nOffice, let us turn southeast on the recently improved and gravelled\r\nLittle Park Road around the head of No Thoroughfare Canyon, which was\r\nadded to the Monument in 1978 (fig. 3). From the intersection it is\r\nabout 14 miles to Grand Junction by this route. In half a mile we reach\r\nthe new boundary of the Monument at a minor drainage divide, and as we\r\nstart down a steep hill beyond we may park on the right and look\r\nsoutheastward across No Thoroughfare Canyon along the Glade Park fault\r\n(fig. 58) which has produced the fishtail shape of the head of the\r\ncanyon, as shown in figures 8 and 59. A different view of the fault and\r\ncanyon head is shown by the stereoscopic pair of aerial photographs in\r\nfigure 59.\r\n\r\nThe Little Park Road closely follows the new Monument boundary around\r\nthe south end of No Thoroughfare Canyon, either on the Kayenta Formation\r\nor Entrada Sandstone, and affords good views into the canyon from\r\nseveral places. East of the southeast arm of the canyon, the road leaves\r\nthe boundary and goes northeastward about 4 miles to the end of the\r\nimproved part of the road, but the unimproved part is good, and the\r\nlower 5 miles is paved. On my geologic maps[41] of the area, I called\r\nthis road by its older name—the Jacobs Ladder Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LADDER AND ROUGH CANYONS\r\n\r\n                                                         [Mile-marker 39]\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the end of the improved stretch, one may\r\nturn right on two tire tracks, travel about a quarter of a mile farther,\r\nand park near the junction of Rough and Ladder Canyons, where\r\ninteresting geology is reachable by short walks up Ladder Canyon or down\r\nRough Canyon. About a mile up Ladder Canyon is an interesting abandoned\r\nmica mine.[42]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GLADE PARK FAULT VIEWED FROM THE GROUND, crossing\r\n    head of No Thoroughfare Canyon.

Having finished this story\r\nand the trips through and around the Monument, let us see how the\r\ncolorful canyons, cliffs, and other erosion forms fit into the bigger\r\nscheme of things—the geologic age and events of the Earth as a whole, as\r\ndepicted in figure 61. As shown in figure 7, the rock strata still\r\npreserved in the Monument range in age from Proterozoic to Cretaceous,\r\nor from about 1,500 million to 100 million years old—a span of about\r\n1,400 million years. This seems an incredibly long time, until one\r\ncompares figures 7 and 61, and notes that the Earth is some 4,500\r\nmillion years old, and that the rock pile in the Monument is only about\r\na third the age of the Earth as a whole.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GEOLOGIC TIME SPIRAL, showing the sequence, names,\r\n    and ages of the geologic periods and epochs, and the evolution of\r\n    plant and animal life on land and in the sea. The primitive animals\r\n    that evolved in the sea during the vast Archean and Proterozoic Eons\r\n    left few traces in the rocks because they had not developed hard\r\n    parts, such as shells, but hard-shell or skeletal parts became\r\n    abundant during and after the Cambrian Period. This drawing was made\r\n    when the Geological Survey and most others used the term Precambrian\r\n    to embrace what is now included in the Archean and Proterozoic Eons.\r\n    The end of the Archean Eon and beginning of the Proterozoic Eon has\r\n    been placed at about 2,500 million years ago. Also, because of more\r\n    recent radiometric dating, the ages of the boundaries between some\r\n    of the geologic periods and epochs have been changed slightly. Of\r\n    most concern to this report, the boundary between the Pliocene and\r\n    Pleistocene Epochs has been changed from 3 million to 2 million\r\n    years. Drawn by John R. Stacy originally for inclusion in a report\r\n    by Newman (1976). (Fig. 61)]\r\n\r\n                             The Age of the Earth\r\n\r\n  The Earth is very old—4.5 billion years or more according to recent\r\n  estimates. Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained in\r\n  the rocks that form the Earth’s crust. The rock layers themselves—like\r\n  pages in a long and complicated history—record the surface-shaping\r\n  events of the past, and buried within them are traces of life—the\r\n  plants and animals that evolved from organic structures that existed\r\n  perhaps 3 billion years ago.\r\n\r\n  Also contained in rocks once molten are radioactive elements whose\r\n  isotopes provide Earth scientists with an atomic clock. Within these\r\n  rocks, “parent” isotopes decay at a predictable rate to form\r\n  “daughter” isotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent and\r\n  daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated.\r\n\r\n  Thus, the results of studies of rock layers (stratigraphy), and of\r\n  fossils (paleontology), coupled with the ages of certain rocks as\r\n  measured by atomic clocks (geochronology), attest to a very old Earth!\r\n\r\nBut this is not the whole story. As indicated earlier, younger Mesozoic\r\nand Tertiary rocks more than 1 mile thick that once covered the area\r\nhave been carried away by erosion, and, if we include these, the span is\r\nincreased by another 50 million years or so.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the geologic formations that make up the national parks\r\n(N.P.), national monuments (N.M.) (excluding small historical or\r\narchaeological ones), Monument Valley, San Rafael Swell, and Glen Canyon\r\nNational Recreation Area, all in the Colorado Plateau, it becomes\r\napparent that certain formations or groups of formations play starring\r\nroles in some parks or monuments, some play supporting roles, and in a\r\nfew places the entire cast of rocks gets about equal billing. Let us\r\ncompare them and see how and where they fit into the “Geologic Time\r\nSpiral” (fig. 61).\r\n\r\nDinosaur N.M. and Colorado N.M., with exposed rocks ranging in age from\r\nProterozoic to Cretaceous, cover the greatest time spans (nearly 2\r\nbillion years), but most of the rocks are missing at Colorado N.M., as\r\nnoted below. Dinosaur N.M. has one unit—the Jurassic Morrison\r\nFormation—in the starring role, for this unit contains the many dinosaur\r\nfossils that give the monument its name and fame, although there are\r\nseveral older units in supporting roles. Grand Canyon N.P. is next, with\r\nrocks ranging in age from Proterozoic through Permian (excluding the\r\nQuaternary lava flows), but here is truly a team effort, for the entire\r\ncast gets about equal billing. Canyonlands N.P. stands third in this\r\ncategory, with rocks ranging from Pennsylvanian to Jurassic, but we\r\nwould have to give top billing to the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone\r\nMember of the Cutler Formation, from which The Needles, The Grabens, and\r\nmost of the arches were sculptured. The Triassic Wingate Sandstone and\r\nthe Triassic(?) Kayenta Formation get second billing for their roles in\r\nforming and preserving Island in the Sky and other high mesas. Now let\r\nus consider other areas with only one or few players in the cast,\r\nbeginning at the bottom of the time spiral. Black Canyon of the Gunnison\r\nN.M., cut entirely in rocks of early Proterozoic age with only a veneer\r\nof much younger rocks, obviously has but one star in its cast. Colorado\r\nN.M. contains rocks ranging from Proterozoic to Cretaceous (equal to\r\nDinosaur in this respect), but Colorado is unique in that all rocks of\r\nthe long Paleozoic Era and some others are missing from the cast. Of\r\nthose that remain, the Triassic Wingate and the Triassic(?) Kayenta are\r\nthe stars, with strong support from the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone and\r\nfrom the Proterozoic rocks, which floor the U-shaped canyons.\r\n\r\nAll the bridges in Natural Bridges N.M. were carved from the Permian\r\nCedar Mesa Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation, also one of the\r\nstars in Canyonlands N.P. In Canyon de Chelly (pronounced dee shay) N.M.\r\nand Monument Valley (neither a national park nor a national monument, as\r\nit is owned and administered by the Navajo Tribe), the De Chelly\r\nSandstone Member of the Cutler Formation—a Permian member younger than\r\nthe Cedar Mesa—plays the starring role.\r\n\r\nWupatki N.M. near Flagstaff, Ariz., stars the Triassic Moenkopi\r\nFormation. Petrified Forest N.P. (which now includes part of the Painted\r\nDesert) has but one star—the Triassic Chinle Formation, in which are\r\nfound many petrified logs and stumps of ancient trees. The\r\nTriassic-Jurassic Glen Canyon Group, which includes the Triassic Wingate\r\nSandstone, the Triassic(?) Kayenta Formation, and the\r\nTriassic(?)-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, receives top billing in recently\r\nenlarged Capitol Reef N.P., but the Triassic Moenkopi and Chinle\r\nFormations enjoy supporting roles.\r\n\r\nThe Triassic(?)-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, which has a supporting role\r\nin Arches N.P., is the undisputed star of Zion N.P., Rainbow Bridge\r\nN.M., and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The Navajo also forms\r\nthe impressive reef at the east edge of the beautiful San Rafael Swell,\r\na dome, or closed anticline, now crossed by Highway I-70 between Green\r\nRiver and Fremont Junction, Utah.\r\n\r\nAs we journey upward in the time spiral (fig. 61), we come to the\r\nJurassic Entrada Sandstone, which stars in Arches N.P., with help from\r\nthe underlying Navajo Sandstone, and a supporting cast of both older and\r\nyounger rocks. The Entrada also forms the grotesque erosion forms called\r\n“hoodoos and goblins” in Goblin Valley State Park, north of Hanksville,\r\nUtah.\r\n\r\nMoving ever upward in the spiral, we come to the Cretaceous—the age of\r\nthe starring Mesaverde Group, in which the caves of Mesaverde N.P. were\r\nformed, and which now house beautifully preserved ruins once occupied by\r\nthe Anasazi (the ancient people who once dwelt in many parts of the\r\nPlateau).\r\n\r\nThis brings us up to the Tertiary Period, during the early part of which\r\nthe pink limestones and shales of the Paleocene and Eocene Wasatch\r\nFormation were laid down in inland basins. Beautifully sculptured\r\ncliffs, pinnacles, and caves of the Wasatch star in Bryce Canyon N.P.\r\nand in nearby Cedar Breaks N.M. This concludes our climb up the time\r\nspiral, except for Quaternary volcanos and some older volcanic features\r\nat Sunset Crater N.M., near Flagstaff, Ariz.\r\n\r\nThus, one way or another, many rock units formed during the last couple\r\nof billion years have performed on the stage of the Colorado Plateau\r\nand, hamlike, still lurk in the wings eagerly awaiting your applause to\r\nrecall them to the footlights. Do not let them down—visit and enjoy the\r\nnational parks and monuments of the Plateau, for they probably are the\r\ngreatest collection of scenic wonderlands in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n\r\nI am grateful to many friends and colleagues not only for help on the\r\npresent report, but also for help on the two preceding reports which\r\nmade this one possible. I refer to my Professional Paper 451,[43] which\r\nsupplied the detailed geologic data and to the first popular-style\r\nbooklet.[44] First of all, I must acknowledge the great help rendered by\r\nmembers of my family—my eldest son Bill for serving as my unpaid field\r\nassistant for most of the detailed mapping of the Grand Junction area,\r\nand my two younger sons Terry and Bob for similar services during the\r\nlast phases of the fieldwork. I am especially indebted to my wife Ruth\r\nfor material assistance in all the fieldwork, including the road logging\r\nand the color photography for the present report.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to several colleagues of the Geological Survey and\r\nNational Park Service for help, data, or reviews of all three reports\r\nnoted, and to members of my family for reviewing both popular-style\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nFor reviewing the present report I am especially indebted to David V.\r\nHarris, Emeritus Professor of Geology, Colorado State University; Harry\r\nA. Tourtelot, Geologist, U.S. Geological Survey, for reviewing both\r\npopular-style reports and contributing petrographic studies to the\r\ndetailed report; and to my wife, Ruth.\r\n\r\nThe comments and criticisms of all reviewers were carefully considered\r\nand most were adopted, but in some places I have preferred to state\r\nthings in my own way, and have included topics that seemingly were of\r\nmore interest to me than to some of the reviewers. The responsibility\r\nfor the form and content of this report thus remains mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               References\r\n\r\n\r\nListed below in alphabetical order are the reports referred to in this\r\nreport.

(See fig. 32.) The varnish is darker on cliff\r\n    faces that have been standing longer. The prehistoric inhabitants of\r\n    the canyon country learned that effective and enduring designs could\r\n    be created simply by chiseling through the thin dark layer to reveal\r\n    the buff, tan, or pink sandstone beneath.
