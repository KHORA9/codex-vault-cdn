The Americans of the\r\ncontinent called it Petun; those of the islands, Yoli. Hernandez de\r\nToledo sent it into Spain from Tabaco, a province of Yucatan, where\r\nhe first found and learned its use; and from which place he gave it\r\nthe denomination it still bears.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh first introduced the use of it into England, in\r\nthe reign of Queen Elizabeth, about the year 1585. The plant was\r\nprobably known in this kingdom before that time, by means of the\r\nSpaniards or Portuguese; it is however certain, that he first taught\r\nthe English to smoke it.\r\n\r\nThe French, on its first introduction among them, gave it various\r\nnames, as Nicotiana, or the Embassador's Herb, from John Nicot, who\r\ncame soon after it was discovered, as embassador to that court, from\r\nFrancis the Second of Portugal, and brought some of it with him;\r\nwhich he presented to a grand Prior of the house of Lorrain, and to\r\nQueen Catherine de Medicis: on this account it was sometimes called\r\nthe Grand Prior's Herb, and sometimes the Queen's Herb.\r\n\r\nWhen, or in what manner this plant was introduced into the oriental\r\nnations is uncertain, although it is at present in general use among\r\nthem. Considerable quantities of it are likewise cultivated in the\r\nLevant, the coasts of Greece and the Archipelago, in the island of\r\nMalta and in Italy.\r\n\r\nTobacco is termed by botanists, Nicotiana; and is arranged by them as\r\na genus of the Pentandria Monogynia class of plants. It is sometimes\r\nused medicinally; but being very powerful in its operations, this\r\nmust be done with great caution. The most common uses of it are,\r\neither as a sternutatory when taken by way of snuff, as a masticatory\r\nby chewing it in the mouth, or as an effluvia by smoking it; and\r\nwhen used with moderation is not an unhealthy amusement, whether it\r\nreplenishes the humble pouch of the rustic, or the golden box of the\r\ncourtier.\r\n\r\nBefore pipes were invented, it was usually smoked in segars, and they\r\nare still in use among some of the southern nations. The method of\r\npreparing these is at once simple and expeditious: a leaf of tobacco\r\nbeing formed into a small twisted roll somewhat larger than the stem\r\nof a pipe, and about eight inches long, the smoke is conveyed through\r\nthe winding folds, which prevent it from expanding, as through a\r\ntube; so that one end of it being lighted, and the other applied\r\nto the mouth, it is in this form used without much inconvenience:\r\nbut in process of time, pipes being invented, they were found more\r\ncommodious vehicles for the smoke, and are now in general use.\r\n\r\nAmong all the productions of foreign climes introduced into these\r\nkingdoms, scarcely any has been held in higher estimation by persons\r\nof every rank than tobacco. In the countries of which it is a native,\r\nit is considered by the Indians as the most valuable offering that\r\ncan be made to the Beings they worship: they use it in all their\r\ncivil and religious ceremonies. When once its spiral wreaths ascend\r\nfrom the feathered pipe of peace, the compact that has just been\r\nmade, is considered as sacred and inviolable. Likewise, when they\r\naddress their great Father, or his guardian Spirits, residing as they\r\nbelieve in every extraordinary production of nature[1], they make\r\nliberal offerings of this valuable plant to them, doubting not but\r\nthat they secure thereby the protection they request.\r\n\r\nSmoking was at first supposed to be the only means by which its\r\nvirtues could be attained; but at length it was found out that\r\nthe juices of it extracted by chewing were of a cordial nature,\r\nalleviating, in laborious employments, the cravings of hunger, or\r\nthe depression of fatigue; and also, that the powder of it received\r\ninto the head through the nostrils, in moderate quantities, was a\r\nsalubrious and refreshing sternutatory. For these purposes, the\r\nAmericans inhabiting the interior settlements manufacture it in the\r\nfollowing easy manner. Being possessed of a tobacco-wheel, which is\r\na very simple machine, they spin the leaves, after they are properly\r\ncured, into a twist of any size they think fit, and having folded it\r\ninto rolls of about twenty pounds weight each, they lay it by for\r\nuse. In this state it will keep for several years, and be continually\r\nimproving, as it every hour grows milder. When they have occasion to\r\nuse it, they take off such a length as they think necessary, which,\r\nif designed for smoking, they cut into small pieces, for chewing into\r\nlonger, as choice directs; if they intend to make snuff of it they\r\ntake a quantity from the roll, and laying it in a room where a fire\r\nis kept, in a day or two it will become dry, and being rubbed on a\r\ngrater will produce a genuine snuff. Those, in more improved regions,\r\nwho like their snuff scented, may apply to it such odoriferous waters\r\nas they can procure, or think most pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois usually form it into carots, which is done by laying a\r\nnumber of leaves, when cured, on each other, after the ribs have been\r\ntaken out, and rolling them round with packthread, till they become\r\ncemented together. These rolls commonly measure about eighteen or\r\ntwenty inches long, and nine round in the middle part. But as many\r\nother methods are at present well known in England, that probably\r\nanswer the purpose full as well as these, it is almost unnecessary to\r\ndescribe them.\r\n\r\nThese directions are here given for the benefit of those who raise\r\ntobacco for their own use, and chuse to make their snuff without\r\napplying to the manufacturer for it.\r\n\r\nAmong the articles of commerce tobacco holds a distinguished rank,\r\nand affords no inconsiderable addition to the revenues of the\r\nstate. Before the present unhappy dissentions broke out between\r\nGreat-Britain and America, about ninety-six thousand hogsheads were\r\nannually imported from Maryland and Virginia. Thirteen thousand\r\nfive hundred of which were consumed at home; the duty of which, at\r\nthe rate of 26_l._ 1_s._ per hogshead, amounted to 351,765_l._ The\r\nremaining eighty-two thousand, five hundred hogsheads were exported\r\nto various parts of Europe, and their value received in specie, or\r\nthe produce of those countries.\r\n\r\nTo the uses already enumerated, I shall add another to which tobacco\r\nmight be applied, that I believe has never been made known to\r\nEuropeans, and which will render it much more estimable than any\r\nof the foregoing. It has been found by the Americans to answer the\r\npurpose of tanning leather, as well, if not better, than bark; and\r\nwas not the latter so plentiful in their country would be generally\r\nused by them instead of it. I have been witness to many experiments\r\nwherein it has proved successful, especially on the thinner sorts of\r\nhides, and can safely pronounce it to be, in countries where bark is\r\nscarce, a valuable substitute for that article.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Vide Travels into the interior parts of North-America, chap. 13,\r\npage 382.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_A Description of the Plant and its Flowers._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several species of the Tobacco Plant, and these are chiefly\r\ndistinguishable by their flowers, and the junction of the leaves to\r\nthe stalks; but as this is not intended for a Botanical Treatise, I\r\nshall confine my description to those sorts which are cultivated in\r\nthe colonies for exportation: these are two; the Oronokoe and the\r\nsweet-scented; which differ from each other in no respect but in the\r\nshape of their leaves, those of the former being longer and narrower\r\nthan the latter. Both are tall, herbaceous plants, of an erect growth\r\nand noble foliage, rising each with a strong stem (in their native\r\nsoil) to the height of from six to nine feet. The stalk is upwards\r\nof an inch diameter near the root, and surrounded with a kind of\r\nhairy or velvet, clammy substance, of a yellowish green colour.\r\nThe leaves, which are rather of a deeper green, grow to the stalk\r\nalternately, at the distance of about two or three inches from each\r\nother. They are oblong, of a spear-shaped-oval, and simple; without\r\npedicles embracing the stalk by an auriculated base. The largest are\r\nabout twenty inches long, decreasing in size as they ascend, till\r\nthey are not longer than ten inches, and nearly half as broad. The\r\nface of the leaves is much undulated, or corrugated, not unlike those\r\nof spinnage when full ripe. In their first state, at the time they\r\ndo not exceed five or six inches, the leaves are usually of a full\r\ngreen, and rather smooth, but as they increase in size they acquire a\r\nyellowish cast and become rougher.\r\n\r\nThe stem and branches are terminated by large bunches of flowers,\r\ncollected into clusters of a delicate red, the edges, when quite\r\nblown, inclining to a pale purple. The flowers continue in\r\nsuccession until the end of summer, when they make room for the\r\nseed. These are of a brown colour, kidney-shaped, and very small,\r\neach capsule generally containing about a thousand, and the whole\r\nproduce of a single plant is estimated at three hundred and fifty\r\nthousand. The seeds are usually ripe in the month of September, and\r\nwhen perfectly dry may be rubbed out and preserved in bags till the\r\nfollowing season.\r\n\r\nThe Oronokoe, or, as it is termed by the seedsmen, the long Virginia,\r\nappears to me to be the sort best suited to bear the rigour of a\r\nnorthern climate, the strength of the plant, as well as the scent\r\nand efficacy of the leaves being greater than the other. The\r\nsweet-scented flourishes most in a sandy soil and warm countries,\r\nwhere it greatly exceeds the former in the celerity of its growth;\r\nand although, as I have before observed, it differs from the Oronokoe\r\nonly in the shape of its leaves, being shorter and rounder, yet it\r\nis unlike in its strength and flavour, being, agreeable to its name,\r\nmuch milder and pleasanter.\r\n\r\nAs a species of garden plants, the Nicotiana is an ornamental annual\r\nfor the pleasure ground, as it attains a majestic stature, and being\r\nadorned with fine luxuriant leaves, and large clusters of pleasing\r\nflowers which terminate all the shoots, during the autumn it exhibits\r\nan elegant appearance.\r\n\r\nFor a more compleat idea of the Oronokoe plant and its flowers, the\r\nreader is referred to the plate prefixed to this Work. But it must be\r\nobserved, that the number of leaves represented on the stalk is not\r\ndesigned to serve as a rule for topping the tobacco, as directed in\r\nthe fourth chapter. Only a few of them are annexed to the stalk, that\r\nthe representation of the leaf might be the more compleat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_Of the Soil and Situation most proper for raising the Plant._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best ground for raising the plant is a warm, kindly, rich soil,\r\nthat is not subject to be over-run with weeds; for from these it must\r\nbe totally cleared. The soil in which it grows in its native climate,\r\nVirginia, is inclining to sandy, consequently warm and light; the\r\nnearer therefore the nature of the land in which it is planted in\r\nEngland approaches to that, the greater probability there is of its\r\nflourishing here. Other kinds of soils may probably be brought to\r\nsuit it, by a mixture with some attenuating species of manure, but\r\na knowledge of this must be the result of repeated trials. It must\r\nhowever be remembered, that whatever manure is added to the soil must\r\nbe thoroughly incorporated with it.\r\n\r\nThe situation most preferable for a plantation is the southern\r\ndeclivity of a hill, rather gradual than abrupt; or a spot that is\r\nsheltered by a wall, a bank, or any other means, from the blighting\r\nnorth winds which so frequently blow, during the spring months,\r\nin this island: but at the same time it is necessary to observe,\r\nthat the plants must enjoy a free current of air; for if that be\r\nobstructed they will not prosper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Of its Culture, with a Description of the Worm that annoys it._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the tobacco plant, being an annual, is only to be raised from\r\nseed, I would particularly recommend to such as mean to cultivate\r\nit, the greatest care in purchasing these, lest by sowing such as\r\nis not good, they lose, with their expected crop, the season. The\r\ndifferent sorts of the seeds not being distinguishable, like the\r\nplants, from each other, nor the goodness to be ascertained by their\r\nappearance, the purchaser, till he has raised a supply from his own\r\ncultivation, must depend on the veracity of the seedsman; who may be\r\nalso sometimes deceived, having nothing to rely on but the honour of\r\nthe person who raised it: prudence therefore requires that he should\r\napply to a person of character in that profession.\r\n\r\nIn describing the manner in which the plant ought to be raised from\r\nthe seed, as well as in the succeeding process, I shall confine\r\nmyself (without regarding the methods usually pursued in Virginia or\r\nMaryland, which, from the difference of the climate, can be of little\r\nservice here) to the practice of the northern colonies of America;\r\nas these are more parallel in their latitude to England. And there\r\nbeing even a difference between the climate of these and that of\r\nGreat-Britain, to the disadvantage of the latter (I mean with regard\r\nto the cultivation of the tobacco plant) I shall minutely attend\r\nto this variation, and in the directions I give endeavour to guard\r\nagainst the inconveniences of it. These instructions shall likewise\r\nbe given in plain and familiar terms, and not in a language that can\r\nbe only understood by the Botanist or Gardener, that this Treatise\r\nmay be of general use.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of April, or rather sooner in a forward spring, (for\r\nthe season must be attended to, as this plant will not bear forcing)\r\nsow the seed in beds first prepared for the purpose, composed of\r\nsuch soil as before described, mixed with some warm, rich manure.\r\nIn a cold spring, regular hot beds would be most eligible for this\r\npurpose; and indeed the Gardeners of this country are persuaded,\r\nthat the Nicotania cannot be raised in any other way; but as these\r\nare seldom to be found in the garden of the farmer, and as I am\r\nconvinced that if the weather is not remarkably severe, they might\r\nbe reared without doors, for his benefit I shall give the following\r\ninstructions relative to their treatment.\r\n\r\nHaving sown the seed in the manner directed, on the least\r\napprehension of a frost after the plants appear, it will be necessary\r\nto spread mats over the beds, a little elevated from the ground by\r\npoles laid across, that they may not be crushed. These however must\r\nbe removed in the morning soon after the sun appears, that they may\r\nreceive as much benefit as possible from its warmth, and from the\r\nair. In this manner proceed till the leaves have attained the size of\r\nabout two inches in length, and one in breadth, which they will do in\r\nabout a month after they are sown, or near the middle of May, when\r\nthe frosts usually are at an end. One invariable rule for their being\r\nable to bear removal is, when the fourth leaf is sprouted, and the\r\nfifth just appears.\r\n\r\nThen take the opportunity of the first rains, or gentle showers, to\r\ntransplant them into such a soil and situation as before described.\r\nThis must be done in the following manner: The land must be plowed,\r\nor dug up with spades, and made as mellow and light as possible.\r\nWhere the plants are to be placed, raise with the hoe small hillocks\r\nat the distance of two feet, or a little more, from each other,\r\ntaking care that no hard sods or lumps are in it, and then just\r\nindent the middle of each, without drilling holes as for some other\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nWhen your ground is thus prepared, dig in a gentle manner from their\r\nnative bed, such plants as are arrived at the state before-mentioned,\r\nand drop, as you pass, one on every hillock. Insert a plant gently\r\ninto each center, pressing the soil around it with your fingers, and\r\ntaking the greatest care, during the operation, that you do not break\r\noff any of the leaves, which are at this time exquisitely tender. If\r\nthe weather proves dry, after they are thus transplanted, they must\r\nbe watered with soft water, in the same manner as is usually done to\r\ncoleworts or plants of a similar kind.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding you now appear to have a sufficient quantity of\r\nplants for the space you intend to cultivate, yet it is necessary\r\nthat you continue to attend to your bed of seedlings, that you may\r\nhave enough to supply any deficiences which, through accident, might\r\narise. From this time great care must be taken to keep the ground\r\nsoft, and free from weeds, by often stirring with your hoe the mould\r\nround the roots; and to prune off the dead leaves that sometimes are\r\nfound near the bottom of the stalk.\r\n\r\nThe difference of this climate from that in which I have been\r\naccustomed to observe the progress of this plant, will not permit me\r\nto direct with certainty the time which is most proper to take off\r\nthe top of it, to prevent it from running to seed. This knowledge\r\ncan only be perfectly acquired by experience. When it has risen to\r\nupwards of two feet, it commonly begins to put forth the branches on\r\nwhich the flowers and seeds are produced; but as this expansion, if\r\nsuffered to take place, would drain the nutriment from the leaves,\r\nwhich are the most valuable part, and thereby lessen their size and\r\nefficacy, it becomes needful at this stage to nip off the extremity\r\nof the stalk, to prevent its growing higher. In some other climates\r\nthe top is commonly cut off when the plant has fifteen leaves. If\r\nthe tobacco is intended to be a little stronger than usual, this is\r\ndone when it has only thirteen; and sometimes, when it is chosen to\r\nbe remarkably powerful, eleven or twelve leaves only are allowed to\r\nexpand. On the contrary, if the planter is desirous to have his crop\r\nvery mild, he suffers it to put forth eighteen or twenty: but in this\r\ncalculation the three or four lower leaves next the ground, which do\r\nnot grow so large and fine as the others, are not to be reckoned.\r\n\r\nThis is denominated \"topping the tobacco,\" and is much better done by\r\nthe finger and thumb, than with any instrument, because the former\r\nclose, at the same time, the pores of the plant; whereas, when it is\r\ndone with the latter, the juices are in some degree exhausted. And\r\nthough this might appear unimportant, yet every method that tends to\r\ngive vigour to the leaves should be carefully pursued.\r\n\r\nFor the same reasons care must be taken to nip off the sprouts that\r\nwill be continually springing up at the junction of the leaves with\r\nthe stalks. \"This is termed succouring or suckering the tobacco,\" and\r\nought to be repeated as often as occasion requires.\r\n\r\nThe last, and not the least concern in the cultivation of this plant,\r\nis the destruction of the worm that nature has given it for an enemy,\r\nand which, like many other reptiles, preys on its benefactor. To\r\ndestroy these, which are the only insects that molest this plant,\r\nor at least to keep them under, for it is impossible totally to\r\nexterminate them, every leaf must be carefully searched. As soon\r\nas a wound is discovered, and it will not be long before it is\r\nperceptible, care must be taken to destroy the cause of it, who will\r\nbe found near it, and from his unsubstantial texture, which I shall\r\ndescribe at the conclusion of this chapter, be easily crushed: but\r\nthe best method is to pluck it away by the horn, and then crush it.\r\nWithout a constant attention to these noxious insects, a whole field\r\nof plants may be soon destroyed; and even if any of them are left in\r\nthe leaves, during the cure, they prove equally destructive. This\r\nis termed \"worming the tobacco;\" and as these worms are found most\r\npredominant the latter end of July, and the beginning of August, they\r\nmust be particularly attended to at that season.\r\n\r\nAs I have just observed, that it is impossible, without experience,\r\nto point out the due time for topping the plant, so it is equally\r\nas impossible to ascertain the time it will take to ripen in this\r\nclimate. That can only be known by future observations; for as it\r\nis at present only cultivated in England as an ornament for the\r\ngarden, no attention has, I believe, been hitherto bestowed on the\r\npreservation of its leaves. The apparent signs, however, of its\r\nmaturity are these: The leaves, as they approach a state of ripeness,\r\nbecome more corrugated or rough; and when fully ripe, appear mottled\r\nwith yellowish spots on the raised parts, whilst the cavities retain\r\ntheir usual green colour. They are, at this time, also thicker\r\nthan they have before been, and are covered with a kind of downy\r\nvelvet, in the same manner as the stalks are described to be, in the\r\npreceding chapter.\r\n\r\nIf heavy rains happen at this critical period, they will wash this\r\nexcrescent substance off, and thereby damage the plants. In this\r\ncase, if the frosty nights are not begun, it is proper to let them\r\nstand a few days longer; when, if the weather be more moderate,\r\nthey will recover this substance again. But if a frost unexpectedly\r\nhappens during the night, they must be carefully examined in the\r\nmorning before the sun has any influence on them; and those which are\r\nfound to be covered with frosty particles, whether thoroughly ripe or\r\nnot, must be cut up: for though they may not all appear to be arrived\r\nat a state of maturity, yet they cannot be far from it, and will\r\ndiffer but little in goodness from those that are perfectly so.\r\n\r\nHaving now given every instruction that occurs to my memory relative\r\nto the culture of the plant, I shall proceed, as proposed, to\r\ndescribe the worm that infests it. It is of the horned species,\r\nand appears to be peculiar to this plant; so that in many parts of\r\nAmerica it is distinguished by the name of the Tobacco-Worm. In\r\nwhat manner it is first produced, or how propagated, is uncertain;\r\nbut doubtless by the same inexplicable means that nature makes use\r\nof to continue the existence of many other classes of this minute\r\npart of the creation. The first time it is discernible, is when\r\nthe plants have gained about half their height: it then appears to\r\nbe nearly as large as a gnat; soon after which it lengthens into a\r\nworm, and by degrees increases in magnitude to the size of a man's\r\nfinger. In shape it is regular from its head to its tail, without\r\nany diminution at either extremity; indented or ribbed round at equal\r\ndistances, nearly a quarter of an inch from each other, and having at\r\nevery one of these divisions, a pair of feet or claws, by which it\r\nfastens itself to the plant. Its mouth, like that of the caterpillar,\r\nis placed under the fore-part of the head. On the top of the head,\r\nbetween the eyes, grows a horn about half an inch in length, and\r\ngreatly resembling a thorn; the extreme part of which is in colour\r\nbrown, of a firm texture, and sharp pointed. By this horn, as before\r\nobserved, it is usually plucked from the leaf. It is easily crushed,\r\nbeing only, to appearance, a composition of green juice inclosed by\r\na membranous covering, without the internal parts of an animated\r\nbeing. The colour of its skin is in general green, interspersed with\r\nspots of a yellowish white; and the whole covered with a short hair\r\nscarcely to be discerned. To preserve the planter from the ravages\r\nof an insect so destructive to his plantation, as he will thereby\r\nbe able to distinguish it with a greater degree of precision, I have\r\ngiven in the frontispiece as exact a representation of it as can be\r\ndone from memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_Of the Manner in which it is usually cured._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the plant is found, agreeable to the preceding directions, to\r\nbe fit for gathering, on the first morning that promises a fair day,\r\nbefore the sun is risen, take an axe or a long knife, and holding the\r\nstalk near the top with one hand, sever it from its root with the\r\nother, as low as possible. Having done this, lay it gently on the\r\nground, so as not to break off the leaves, and there let it remain\r\nexposed to the rays of the sun throughout the day, or until the\r\nleaves are entirely wilted, as it is termed in America; that is, till\r\nthey become limber, and will bend any way without breaking.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the contrary, the rain should continue without any\r\nintervals, and the plants appear to be full ripe, they must be cut\r\ndown and housed immediately. This must be done, however, with great\r\ncare, that the leaves, which are in this state very brittle, may not\r\nbe broken. Being placed under proper shelter, either in a barn or a\r\ncovered hovel, where they cannot be affected by the rain or too much\r\nair, they must be thinly scattered on the floor, and if the sun does\r\nnot appear for several days, so that they can be laid out again, they\r\nmust remain to wilt in that manner; which is not indeed so desirable\r\nas in the sun, nor will the tobacco prove quite so good.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves have acquired the flexibility before described, the\r\nplants must be laid in heaps, or rather in one heap, if the quantity\r\nbe not too great, and in about twenty-four hours they will be found\r\nto sweat. But during this time, when they have lain for a little\r\nwhile, and begin to ferment, it is necessary to turn them; bringing\r\nthose which are in the middle to the surface, and placing those which\r\nwere at the surface, in the middle, that by this means the whole\r\nquantity may be equally fermented. The longer they lie in this\r\nsituation the darker coloured the tobacco becomes. This is termed\r\n\"sweating the tobacco.\"\r\n\r\nAfter they have lain in this manner for three or four days, for in\r\na longer time they may heat so much as to grow mouldy, the plants\r\nmay be fastened together in pairs, with cords or wooden pegs, near\r\nthe bottom of the stalk, and hung across a pole, with the leaves\r\nsuspended, in the same covered place, a proper interval being left\r\nbetween each pair. In about a month the leaves will be thoroughly\r\ndried, and of a proper temperature to be taken down. This state\r\nmay be ascertained by their appearing of the same colour as those\r\nimported from America, with which few are unacquainted. But this can\r\nbe done at no other season than during wet weather; for the tobacco\r\nbeing a plant greatly abounding with salts, it is always affected if\r\nthere is the least humidity in the atmosphere, even though it be hung\r\nin a dry place. If this rule be not observed, but they are removed\r\nin dry weather, the external parts of the leaves will crumble into\r\ndust, and a considerable waste will attend its removal.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants are taken down, they must once more be laid in\r\na heap, and pressed with heavy logs of wood for about a week. This\r\nclimate, however, may require a longer time. While they remain in\r\nthis state, it will be necessary to introduce your hand frequently\r\ninto the heap, to discover whether the heat be not too intense; for\r\nin large quantities this will sometimes be the case, and considerable\r\ndamage will accrue from it.\r\n\r\nWhen they are found to heat too much, that is, when the heat exceeds\r\na moderate glowing warmth, part of the weight by which they are\r\ncompressed must be taken away; and the cause being removed, the\r\neffect will cease. This is called \"the second or last sweating,\" and\r\nwhen compleated, which it generally will be in about the time just\r\nmentioned, the leaves may be stripped from the stalks for use. Many\r\nomit this last operation, but I think it takes away any remaining\r\nharshness, and renders the tobacco more mellow. The strength of the\r\nstalk also is diffused by it through the leaves, and the whole mass\r\nbecomes equally meliorated.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves are stripped from the stalks, they are to be tied up\r\nin bunches or hands, and kept in a cellar, or any other place that is\r\ndamp; though if not handled in dry weather, but only during a rainy\r\nseason, it is of little consequence in what part of the house or barn\r\nthey are laid up. At this period the tobacco is thoroughly cured,\r\nand equally as proper for manufacturing as that imported from the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through the whole process, if it has been properly\r\nmanaged, that raw fiery taste so frequently found in the common sale\r\ntobacco will be totally eradicated, and though it retains all its\r\nstrength, will be soft and pleasing in its flavour. Those who are\r\ncurious in their tobacco in the northern colonies of America sprinkle\r\nit, when made up into the roles for keeping, described in the first\r\nchapter, with small common white wines or cyder, instead of salt\r\nwater, which gives it an inexpressibly fine flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat estrangement which at present subsists between Great-Britain\r\nand the American colonies, renders a supply of the article of\r\nwhich I treat, and which is become so essentially necessary to\r\nthe happiness of a great number of his Majesty's subjects, very\r\nuncertain; it depends, in a great measure, on the prizes, freighted\r\nwith this commodity, that happen to be taken, and on the quantities\r\nwhich are imported from other commercial states at a high price.\r\nIt is therefore to be hoped that the legislature will take into\r\nconsideration so important a concern, and pursue such measures as\r\nwill conduce to remove this uncertainty. A remedy is at hand;\r\nthat of cultivating it in these kingdoms; but this appears to be\r\nprohibited by the following ancient acts of parliament:\r\n\r\nIn an act of Charles the Second, entitled, \"An act for prohibiting\r\nthe planting, setting, or sowing tobacco in England and Ireland,\" the\r\nprohibition is thus expressed: \"Your Majesty's loyal and obedient\r\nsubjects, the Lords and Commons in this present parliament assembled,\r\nconsidering of how great concern and importance it is, that the\r\ncolonies and plantations of this kingdom in America, be defended,\r\nprotected, maintained, and kept up, and that all due and possible\r\nencouragement be given unto them; and that not only in regard great\r\nand considerable dominions and countries have been thereby gained,\r\nand added to the imperial crown of this realm, but for that the\r\nstrength and welfare of this kingdom, do very much depend upon\r\nthem, in regard of the employment of a very considerable part of\r\nits shipping and seamen, and of the vent of very great quantities\r\nof its native commodities and manufactures, as also of its supply\r\nwith several considerable commodities which it was wont formerly to\r\nhave only from foreigners, and at far dearer rates: And forasmuch as\r\ntobacco is one of the main products of several of those plantations,\r\nand upon which their welfare and subsistence, and the navigation of\r\nthis kingdom, and vent of its commodities thither, do much depend;\r\nand in regard it is found by experience, That by the planting of\r\ntobacco in these parts your Majesty is deprived of a considerable\r\npart of your revenue arising by customs upon imported tobacco; Do\r\nmost humbly pray, That it may be enacted by your Majesty: And it is\r\nhereby enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, and the Lords\r\nand Commons in this present parliament assembled, and by authority\r\nof the same, That no person or persons whatsoever, shall or do from\r\nand after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord One\r\nThousand Six Hundred and Sixty, set, plant, improve to grow, make\r\nor cure any tobacco either in seed, plant, or otherwise, in or upon\r\nany ground, earth, field, or place within the kingdom of England,\r\ndominion of Wales, islands of Guernsey or Jersey, or town of Berwick\r\nupon Tweed, or in the kingdom of Ireland, under the penalty of the\r\nforfeiture of all such tobacco, or the value thereof, or of the sum\r\nof forty shillings for every rod or pole of ground so planted, set\r\nor sown as aforesaid, and so proportionably for a greater or lesser\r\nquantity of ground; one moiety thereof to his Majesty, his heirs and\r\nsuccessors; and the other moiety to him or them that shall sue for\r\nthe same, to be recovered by bill, plaint, or information in any\r\ncourt of record, wherein no essoign, protection or wager in law shall\r\nbe allowed.\r\n\r\n\"Provided always and it is hereby enacted, That this act, nor any\r\nthing therein contained, shall extend to the hindering of the\r\nplanting of tobacco in any physic garden of either university, or in\r\nany other private garden for physic or chyrurgery, only so as the\r\nquantity so planted exceed not half of one pole in any one place or\r\ngarden.\"\r\n\r\nIn this act all sheriffs, justices of the peace, or other officers,\r\nupon information or complaint made unto them, are empowered to cause\r\nto be burnt, plucked up, consumed or utterly destroyed all such\r\ntobacco, set, sown, planted or growing within their jurisdiction. But\r\nit not proving forcible enough to prevent the cultivation of tobacco;\r\nin the fifteenth year of the reign of the said King, a clause was\r\ninserted in an act, entitled, \"An act for the encouragement of\r\ntrade,\" to the following purport, clause 18.\r\n\r\n\"And forasmuch as planting and making tobacco within the kingdom of\r\nEngland doth continue and encrease, to the apparent loss of his said\r\nMajesty in his customs, the discouragement of the English plantations\r\nin the parts beyond the seas, and prejudice of this kingdom in\r\ngeneral, notwithstanding an act of parliament made in the twelfth\r\nyear of his said Majesty's reign for prevention thereof, entituled,\r\nAn act for prohibiting the planting, setting or sowing of tobacco in\r\nEngland and Ireland; and forasmuch as it is found by experience, that\r\nthe reason why the said planting and making of tobacco doth continue,\r\nis, That the penalties prescribed and appointed by that law are so\r\nlittle, as to have neither power or effect over the transgressors\r\nthereof; For remedy therefore of so great an evil, Be it enacted by\r\nthe authority aforesaid, That all and every the person or persons\r\nwhatsoever, that do, or shall at any time hereafter set, plant or\r\nsow any tobacco in seed, plant or otherwise, in or upon any ground,\r\nfield, earth, or place within the kingdom of England, &c. shall, over\r\nand above the penalty of the said act for that purpose ordained,\r\nfor every such offence forfeit and pay the sum of ten pounds for\r\nevery rod or pole of ground that he or they shall so plant, set,\r\nor sow with tobacco, and so proportionably for a greater or lesser\r\nquantity of ground; one third part thereof to the King, one other\r\nthird part to the poor of such respective parish or parishes wherein\r\nsuch tobacco shall be so planted, and the other third thereof to him\r\nor them that shall sue for the same.\" \"Physic gardens excepted as\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nThis penalty also proving insufficient to put a stop to the\r\ncultivation, it was found necessary in the twenty-second year of the\r\nreign of the said Charles the Second to enforce it by the following\r\nact, entitled, \"An act to prevent the planting of tobacco in\r\nEngland, and regulating the plantation trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas the sowing, setting, planting and curing of tobacco, within\r\ndivers parts of the kingdom of England, doth continue and increase,\r\nto the apparent loss of his Majesty's customs, and the discouragement\r\nof his Majesty's plantations in America, and great prejudice of the\r\ntrade and navigation of this realm, and the vent of its commodities\r\nthither, notwithstanding an act of parliament made in the twelfth\r\nyear of his Majesty's reign that now is, for the prevention thereof,\r\nentitled, 'An act for prohibiting the planting, setting, or sowing\r\nof tobacco in England and Ireland;' And also one other act of this\r\npresent parliament, made in the fifteenth year of his said Majesty's\r\nreign, entitled, 'An act for the encouragement of trade.'\r\n\r\n\"And forasmuch as the remedies and provisions by these laws are found\r\nnot large enough to obviate and prevent the planting thereof, Be\r\nit therefore enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,\r\nand Commons in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the\r\nsame, That from and after the first day of May, which shall be in\r\nthe year of our Lord, One Thousand Six Hundred and Seventy-one, all\r\njustices of the peace, within their several limits and jurisdictions,\r\nshall and do, a month before every general quarter-sessions to be\r\nholden for their respective counties, issue forth their warrants\r\nto all high-constables, petty-constables, and tything-men, within\r\ntheir several limits, thereby requiring the said high-constables,\r\npetty-constables and tything-men, and every of them, to make\r\ndiligent search and inquisition, what tobacco is then sown, set,\r\nplanted, growing, curing, cured or made within their several and\r\nrespective limits and jurisdictions, and by whom; and to make a true\r\nand lawful presentment in writing upon oath, at the next general\r\nquarter-sessions to be holden for such county, of the names of all\r\nsuch persons as have sown, set, planted, cured or made any tobacco;\r\nand what the full quantity of land is, or was sown, set or planted\r\ntherewith, and who are the immediate tenant or tenants, or present\r\noccupiers of the land so sown, set or planted, who are or shall be\r\ndeemed planters thereof, to all intents and purposes.\r\n\r\n\"Which said presentment upon oath, shall be received and filed by the\r\nclerk of the said county in open sessions; and after such receipt\r\nand filing, shall be a sufficient conviction in law to all intents\r\nand purposes, of all such persons as shall be so presented for the\r\nsowing, setting, planting, improving to grow, making or curing\r\ntobacco, either in seed, plant, leaf, or otherwise, contrary to the\r\nsaid recited act or either of them; unless such person or persons\r\nso presented shall, according to the usual forms, traverse such\r\npresentment.\r\n\r\n\"And it is hereby further enacted, That all constables, tything-men,\r\nbailiffs, and other public officers, shall and do within their\r\nrespective jurisdictions, from time to time, as often as occasion\r\nshall require, within fourteen days after warrant from two or more\r\nof the justices of the peace within such county, town, city or\r\nplace, to them, calling to their assistance such person or persons\r\nas they and every of them shall find convenient and necessary, pluck\r\nup, burn, consume, tear to pieces, and utterly destroy, all tobacco\r\nseed, plant, leaf, planted, sowed, or growing in any field, earth or\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nThe other clauses relative to the cultivation of tobacco in this act,\r\nare, \"A penalty on the officers of five shillings for every rod,\r\nperch, or pole of ground so set, planted, or sowed with tobacco,\r\nthat shall be suffered or permitted to grow or be consumed in seed,\r\nplant or leaf, within their jurisdiction, by the space of fourteen\r\ndays after the receipt of such warrant or warrants.\" \"A penalty for\r\nrefusing to assist the officers, and also for resisting them.\" And\r\nafter making the same provision as before for the physic gardens, and\r\nreciting many other articles for regulating the plantation trade, the\r\nact thus concludes: \"Provided always, and be it enacted. That this\r\nact shall continue in force for nine years, and from thence to the\r\nnext session of parliament, and no longer.\"\r\n\r\nBy an act made the fifth of George the First, these acts are\r\nconfirmed and rendered perpetual.\r\n\r\nThe repeated inforcement of them seems to prove, that large\r\nquantities of tobacco were raised at that period in these dominions,\r\nand that even the penalty of ten pounds per rod was not sufficient\r\nto deter persons from the cultivation of it.\r\n\r\nAs an application has just been made to parliament for an act to\r\npermit the growth of it in Ireland, the observations made in this\r\nTreatise will not, I flatter myself, be thought unworthy the notice\r\nof the legislature, that so advantageous a branch of agriculture may\r\nnot be confined to one division of Great-Britain, but that every part\r\nof these united kingdoms may be allowed to share in the emoluments\r\narising from it.\r\n\r\nThe advantages which will proceed from the permission, are too many\r\nto be enumerated in so short a Work. Whether a sufficient quantity\r\ncan be raised in these kingdoms to supply the demand there was for\r\nit before the American trade became interrupted, (as a revival of\r\nthe demand will be the certain consequence of a reduction of the\r\nprice) time alone can discover: but if enough be only raised for home\r\nconsumption, this will be no inconsiderable saving to the nation.\r\n\r\nWhen the very great profits, arising to the planter from every acre\r\nof tobacco, come to be known, (they will appear chimerical if I\r\ninform my readers to what they amount) I doubt not but that tobacco\r\nwill be considered as the most valuable branch of agriculture which\r\ncan be attended to. An emulation, heightened by the prospect of\r\ngain, being once excited in the breasts of the landholders of these\r\nkingdoms, large tracks of land that now lie unimproved, will be\r\ncultivated, and, after some years, enough may probably be raised to\r\nanswer the usual demands for exportation.\r\n\r\nBy this means the revenue, which has been so greatly diminished by\r\nthe unhappy divisions between Great-Britain and the colonies, will\r\nbe in a great measure restored. The duties to be collected for this\r\npurpose may either be laid on the plants before they are gathered, or\r\nduring the time of cure, as on the article of malt; the collection\r\nof which would be attended with very little additional expence, and\r\nprobably, at no distant period, amount to as much as was heretofore\r\nreceived on imported tobacco. When the happy √¶ra arrives that will\r\nunite once more Great-Britain to the American colonies (an event, I\r\nfear, more to be wished than expected) and a constant uninterrupted\r\nsupply of this necessary exotic provided, the wonted restraint might\r\nbe renewed, as far as is consistent with the situation of both\r\ncountries at that time.\r\n\r\nBy pursuing the rules laid down in the preceding chapters, which I\r\nhave endeavoured to give in as explicit terms as possible, country\r\ngentlemen and landholders in general will be enabled to raise much\r\nbetter tobacco than that which is usually imported from Maryland or\r\nVirginia: for notwithstanding there are not wanting prohibitory laws\r\nin those countries to prevent the planters from sending to market any\r\nbut the principal leaves, yet as most other commodities are subject\r\nto abuse or adulteration, they frequently, to increase their profit,\r\nsuffer the sprouts to grow, and mix the smaller leaves of these with\r\nthe others, which renders them much inferior in goodness.\r\n\r\nThe crops that I have reason to believe may be raised in England,\r\nwill greatly exceed in flavour and efficacy any that is imported\r\nfrom the southern colonies: for though northern climates require far\r\nmore care and exactness to cultivate and bring tobacco to a proper\r\nstate of maturity than warmer latitudes, yet this tardiness of growth\r\ntends to impregnate the plants with a greater quantity of salts, and\r\nconsequently of that aromatic flavour for which it is prized, than is\r\nto be found in the produce of hotter climes, where it is brought to\r\na state of perfection, from the seed, in half the time required in\r\ncolder regions.\r\n\r\nA pound of tobacco raised in New-England or Nova-Scotia is supposed\r\nto contain as much real strength as two pounds of Virginia; and\r\nI doubt not but that near double the quantity of salts might be\r\nextracted from it by a chymical process.\r\n\r\nGood tobacco, the produce of the northern colonies, is powerful,\r\naromatic, and has a most pleasing flavour. The fumes of it are\r\ninvigorating to the head, and leave not that nausea on the stomach\r\nthat the common sort does. As much time would be required to smoke\r\none pipe of it, as three of that which is generally used: before so\r\ngreat a quantity of the vapour could be drawn from it as to prove\r\nhurtful, the smoker, from intoxication, would be unable to continue\r\nhis amusement. I can truly say, after a residence of several years\r\nin England, that I never met with any tobacco, though I frequently\r\nsmoke, that in strength or the delicacy of its flavour, is to be\r\ncompared with that which I have been accustomed to in New-England.\r\n\r\nMany authors have given accounts of the bad effects proceeding from\r\nan immoderate use of tobacco. Borrhi mentions a person, who through\r\nexcess of smoking, had dried his brain to so great a degree, that\r\nafter his death there was nothing found in his skull but a small\r\nblack lump confirming of mere membranes. From the use of good tobacco\r\nthis could not have happened; for, as I have just observed, the fumes\r\nwhich only prove noxious from an immoderate continuance, could not\r\nhave been repeated so often as to produce such dreadful effects.\r\n\r\nTo the instructions already given I shall add, that I would advise\r\nthe planter, in his first trials, not to be too avaricious, but to\r\ntop his plants before they have gained their utmost height; leaving\r\nonly about the middle quantity of leaves directed before, to give it\r\na tolerable degree of strength. For though this, if excessive, might\r\nbe abated during the cure, by an increase of sweating, or be remedied\r\nthe next season by more leaves being suffered to grow, it can never\r\nbe added; and without a certain degree, the tobacco will always be\r\ntasteless and of little value. On the contrary, though it be ever so\r\nmuch weakened by sweating, and thereby rendered mild, yet it will\r\nnever lose that aromatic flavour which accompanied that strength, and\r\nwhich greatly adds to its value.\r\n\r\nIn the directions before given for raising the plants from the seed,\r\nI have omitted to mention the size of the beds on which a specified\r\nnumber of them may be produced. I apprehend that a square yard of\r\nland, for which a very small quantity of seed is sufficient, they\r\nbeing so diminutive, will produce about five hundred plants, and\r\nallow proper space for their nurture till they are fit to transplant.\r\n\r\nI shall also just add, though the example can only be followed in\r\nparticular parts of these kingdoms, that the Americans usually chuse\r\nfor the place where they intend to make the seedling-bed, part of a\r\ncopse, or a spot of ground covered with wood, of which they burn down\r\nsuch a portion as they think necessary. Having done this, they rake\r\nup the subjacent mould, and mixing it with the ashes thus produced,\r\nsow therein the seed, without adding any other manure, or taking any\r\nother steps. Where this method cannot be pursued (though it is much\r\nthe best, as it destroys at the same time the weeds) wood ashes,\r\nwhich are most proper manure for this purpose, may be strewed over\r\nthe mould in which the seed is designed to be sown.\r\n\r\nThe Author presumes that the preceding instructions will be found\r\nsufficient for any person inclined to enter upon the cultivation of\r\ntobacco; yet if any nobleman or gentleman wishes to consult him upon\r\nthe subject, he will give his attendance on receiving a line at his\r\nPublisher's.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FINIS.",
