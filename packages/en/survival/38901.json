Know'st thou this country?\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born,\r\n  Not three hours travel from this very place.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ Who governs here?\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ A noble duke, in nature,\r\n  As in his name.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ What is his name?\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ Orsino.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ Orsino!--I have heard my father name him:\r\n  He was a bachelor then.\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ And so is now,\r\n  Or was so very late: for but a month\r\n  Ago I went from hence; and then 'twas fresh\r\n  In murmur, (as, you know, what great ones do,\r\n  The less will prattle of,) that he did seek\r\n  The love of fair Olivia.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ What is she?\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count\r\n  That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her\r\n  In the protection of his son, her brother,\r\n  Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,\r\n  They say, she hath abjured the company\r\n  And sight of men.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ Oh, that I served that lady!\r\n  And might not be deliver'd to the world,\r\n  Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,\r\n  What my estate is!\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ That were hard to compass;\r\n  Because she will admit no kind of suit,\r\n  No, not the duke's.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ There is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;\r\n  And, I believe, thou hast a mind that suits\r\n  With this thy fair and outward character.\r\n  I pray thee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,\r\n  Conceal me what I am; and be my aid\r\n  For such disguise as, haply, shall become\r\n  The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke;\r\n  Thou shalt present me as a page unto him,\r\n  Of gentle breeding, and my name, Cesario:--\r\n  That trunk, the reliques of my sea-drown'd brother,\r\n  Will furnish man's apparel to my need:--\r\n  It may be worth thy pains: for I can sing,\r\n  And speak to him in many sorts of music,\r\n  That will allow me very worth his service.\r\n  What else may hap, to time I will commit;\r\n  Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.\r\n\r\n    _Rob._ Be you his page, and I your mute will be;\r\n  When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see!\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ I thank thee:--Lead me on.

I am sure, care's an enemy to life.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights;\r\nyour niece, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Why, let her except before excepted.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of\r\norder.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Confine? I'll confine myself no finer than I am: these\r\nclothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; an they\r\nbe not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ That quaffing and drinking will undo you; I heard my lady\r\ntalk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight, that you have brought in\r\nhere, to be her wooer.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Who? Sir Andrew Ague-cheek?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Ay, he.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ What's that to the purpose?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Why, he has three thousand ducats a-year.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats; he's a\r\nvery fool, and a prodigal.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Fye, that you'll say so! he plays o' the viol-de-gambo,\r\nand hath all the good gifts of nature.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ He hath, indeed, all, most natural; for, besides that he's a\r\nfool, he's a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a\r\ncoward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the\r\nprudent, he would quickly have the gift of a grave.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ By this band, they are scoundrels, and substractors, that\r\nsay so of him. Who are they?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ With drinking healths to my niece; I'll drink to her, as\r\nlong as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria: He's a\r\ncoward, and a coystril, that will not drink to my niece, till his brains\r\nturn o' the toe like a parish-top--See, here comes Sir Andrew Ague-face.\r\n\r\n                                     [SIR ANDREW AGUE-CHEEK, _without_.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Sweet Sir Andrew!\r\n\r\n                          _Enter_ SIR ANDREW.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Bless you, fair shrew.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ And you too, sir.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ What's that?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ My niece's chamber-maid.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ My name is Mary, sir.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Good Mistress Mary Accost,----\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ You mistake, knight; accost, is, front her, board her, woo\r\nher, assail her.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.\r\nIs that the meaning of accost?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Fare you well, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, 'would thou might'st\r\nnever draw sword again.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw\r\nsword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Sir, I have not you by the hand.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ [_Takes his hand._] Now, sir, thought is free: I pray you,\r\nbring your hand to the buttery-bar, and let it drink.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ It's dry, sir.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Why, I think so; I am not such an ass, but I can keep my\r\nhand dry. But what's your jest?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ A dry jest, sir.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Are you full of them?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Ay, sir; I have them at my fingers' ends: marry, [_Lets go\r\nhis hand._] now I let go your hand, I am barren.          [_Exit_ MARIA.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ O knight, thou lack'st a cup of canary: When did I see\r\nthee so put down?\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me\r\ndown: Methinks, sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian, or an\r\nordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and, I believe, that\r\ndoes harm to my wit.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ No question.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home\r\nto-morrow, Sir Toby.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ _Pourquoy_, my dear knight?\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ What is _pourquoy_? do, or not do? I would I had bestow'd\r\nthat time in the tongues, that I have in fencing, dancing, and\r\nbear-baiting: O, had I but follow'd the arts!\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Why, would that have mended my hair?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Past question; for, thou seest, it will not curl by\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ But it becomes me well enough, does't not?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to\r\nsee a housewife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ 'Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece will\r\nnot be seen; or, if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me: the duke\r\nhimself, here hard by, wooes her.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ She'll none o' the duke; she'll not match above her\r\ndegree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear it.\r\nTut, there's life in't, man.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the strangest\r\nmind i' the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Art thou good at these kick-shaws, knight?\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree\r\nof my betters; and yet I'll not compare with an old man.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ 'Faith, I can cut a caper.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ And I can cut the mutton to't.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ And, I think, I have the back-trick, simply as strong as\r\nany man in Illyria.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts\r\na curtain before them? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and\r\ncome home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig. What dost thou\r\nmean? is it a world to hide virtues in?--I did think, by the excellent\r\nconstitution of thy leg, it was form'd under the star of a galliard.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a\r\nflame-colour'd stock. Shall we set about some revels?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Taurus? that's sides and heart.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee\r\ncaper:--Ha! higher:--Ha, ha!--excellent!\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SCENE IV.\r\n\r\n                  _A Room in_ DUKE ORSINO'S _Palace_.\r\n\r\n         _Enter_ VALENTINE, _and_ VIOLA _in Man's Attire_.\r\n\r\n    _Val._ If the duke continue these favors towards you, Cesario, you\r\nare like to be much advanced.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ You either fear his humour, or my negligence, that you call\r\nin question the continuance of his love: Is he inconstant, sir, in his\r\nfavours?\r\n\r\n    _Val._ No, believe me.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ I thank you.--Here comes the duke.\r\n\r\n                 _Enter_ DUKE, CURIO, _and Gentlemen_.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Who saw Cesario, ho?\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ On your attendance, my lord; here.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Stand you awhile aloof.--Cesario,\r\n  Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd\r\n  To thee the book even of my secret soul:\r\n  Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;\r\n  Be not denied access, stand at her doors,\r\n  And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow,\r\n  Till thou have audience.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ Sure, my noble lord,\r\n  If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow\r\n  As it is spoke, she never will admit me.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds,\r\n  Rather than make unprofited return.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ Say, I do speak with her, my lord.

Take away the lady.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Go to, you're a dry fool: I'll no more of you; besides, you\r\ngrow dishonest.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend;\r\nfor, give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the\r\ndishonest man mend himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he\r\ncannot, let the botcher mend him.--The lady bade take away the fool;\r\ntherefore, I say again, take her away.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Sir, I bade them take away you.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Misprision in the highest degree!--Lady, _Cucullus non facit\r\nmonachum_; that's as much as to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good\r\nmadonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Can you do it?\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Dexterously, good madonna.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Make your proof.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ I must catechize you for it, madonna: Good my mouse of\r\nvirtue, answer me.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll 'bide your proof.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Good madonna, why mourn'st thou?\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Good fool, for my brother's death.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ I think, his soul is in hell, madonna.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ I know, his soul is in heaven, fool.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ The more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul\r\nbeing in heaven.--Take away the fool, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him:\r\nInfirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Heaven send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better\r\nincreasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn, that I am no fox; but he\r\nwill not pass his word for two-pence that you are no fool.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ How say you to that, Malvolio?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal;\r\nI saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more\r\nbrain than a stone.--Look you now, he's out of his guard already: unless\r\nyou laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagg'd.--I protest, I take\r\nthese wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than\r\nthe fools' zanies.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a\r\ndistemper'd appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free\r\ndisposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts, that you deem\r\ncannon-bullets: There is no slander in an allow'd fool, though he do\r\nnothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do\r\nnothing but reprove.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well\r\nof fools!\r\n\r\n                             _Enter_ MARIA.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman, much desires\r\nto speak with you.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ From the Duke Orsino, is it?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ I know not, madam.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Who of my people hold him in delay?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman: Fye\r\non him!

I\r\ntold him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and\r\ntherefore comes to speak with you: I told him you were asleep; he seems\r\nto have a fore-knowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with\r\nyou. What is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified against any denial.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Tell him, he shall not speak with me.\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ He has been told so; and, he says, he'll stand at your door\r\nlike a sheriff's post, and be the supporter of a bench, but he'll speak\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ What kind of man is he?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Why, of man-kind.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ What manner of man?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you, or no.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Of what personage, and years, is he?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as\r\na squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a coddling when 'tis almost an\r\napple: 'tis with him e'en standing water, between boy and man. He is\r\nvery well-favour'd, and he speaks very shrewishly; one would think, his\r\nmother's milk were scarce out of him.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Let him approach: Call in my gentlewoman.\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Gentlewoman, my lady calls.

Do not our lives\r\nconsist of the four elements?\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ 'Faith, so they say; but, I think, it rather consists of\r\neating and drinking.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Thou art a scholar; let us therefore eat and\r\ndrink.--Maria, I say!----a stoop of wine!\r\n\r\n                                           [_The_ CLOWN _sings without_.\r\n\r\n                                      [SIR ANDREW _and_ SIR TOBY _rise_.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Here comes the fool, i'faith.\r\n\r\n                           _Enter_ CLOWN.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ How now, my hearts?

[_Exit_ CLOWN.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ This fellow's wise enough to play the fool;\r\n  And to do that well, craves a kind of wit:\r\n  He must observe their mood on whom he jests,\r\n  The quality of persons, and the time;\r\n  And, like the haggard, check at every feather\r\n  That comes before his eye.

[_Smiles fantastically._\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Smilest thou?\r\n  I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Sad, lady? I could be sad: This does make some obstruction in\r\nthe blood, this cross-gartering: But what of that? if it please the eye\r\nof one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: _Please one, and\r\nplease all_.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.--It did come\r\nto his hands, and commands shall be executed.

What, man! defy the devil: consider, he's\r\nan enemy to mankind.\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Do you know what you say?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at\r\nheart! Pray, heaven, he be not bewitch'd.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Carry his water to the wise woman.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Pr'ythee, hold thy peace; do you not see, you move him?\r\nlet me alone with him.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough,\r\nand will not be roughly used.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Why, how now, my bawcock? how dost thou, chuck?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Sir?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Ay, Biddy, come with me.--What, man! 'tis not for gravity\r\nto play at cherry-pit with Satan: Hang him, foul collier!\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Get him to say his prayers, Sir Toby.\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ My prayers, minx?\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ No, I warrant you, he'll not hear of godliness.\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things: I am\r\nnot of your element; you shall know more hereafter. Begone. Ha! ha!\r\nha!                                                    [_Exit_ MALVOLIO.\r\n\r\n    _Omnes._ Ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Is't possible?\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as\r\nan improbable fiction.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ His very genius hath taken the infection of the device,\r\nman.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ Nay, pursue him now; lest the device take air, and taint.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Why, we shall make him mad, indeed.\r\n\r\n    _Mar._ The house will be the quieter.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Come, we'll have him in a dark room, and bound.--Follow\r\nhim, and let him not from thy sight.                      [_Exit_ MARIA.\r\nBut see, but see.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ More matter for a May morning.\r\n\r\n                  _Enter_ SIR ANDREW, _with a Letter_.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Here's the challenge, read it; I warrant, there's vinegar\r\nand pepper in't.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Is't so saucy?\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Ay, is it, I warrant him: do but read.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Give me.--[_Reads._] _Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art\r\nbut a scurvy fellow._\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Good and valiant.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ _Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call\r\nthee so, for I will show thee no reason for't._\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ _Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses\r\nthee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat, that is not the matter I\r\nchallenge thee for._\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Very brief, and exceeding good sense-less.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ _I will way-lay thee going home; where if it be thy chance\r\nto kill me_,--\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Good.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ _Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain._\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: Good.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ _Fare thee well; and heaven have mercy upon one of our\r\nsouls! He may have mercy upon mine; but my hope is better, and so look\r\nto thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy_, ANDREW\r\nAGUECHEEK.--If this letter move him not, his legs cannot: I'll give't\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ You may have very fit occasion for't; he is now in some\r\ncommerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Go, Sir Andrew; scout me for him at the corner of the\r\ngarden, like a bum-bailiff; so soon as ever thou seest him, draw; and,\r\nas thou draw'st, swear horrible; for it comes to pass oft, that a\r\nterrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twang'd off, gives\r\nmanhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him.\r\nAway.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Nay, let me alone for swearing.       [_Exit_ SIR ANDREW.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behaviour of\r\nthe young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding;\r\ntherefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no\r\nterror in the youth, he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I\r\nwill deliver his challenge by word of mouth; set upon Ague-cheek a\r\nnotable report of valour; and drive the gentleman, (as, I know, his\r\nyouth will aptly receive it,) into a most hideous opinion of his rage,\r\nskill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both, that they\r\nwill kill one another by the look, like cockatrices.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Here he comes with your niece: give them way, till he take\r\nleave, and presently after him.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a\r\nchallenge.                              [_Exeunt_ SIR TOBY _and_ FABIAN.\r\n\r\n                      _Enter_ VIOLA _and_ OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._  I have said too much unto a heart of stone,\r\n  And laid mine honour too unchary out:\r\n  There's something in me, that reproves my fault;\r\n  But such a headstrong potent fault it is,\r\n  That it but mocks reproof.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ With the same 'haviour that your passion bears,\r\n  Go on my master's griefs.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;\r\n  Refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you:\r\n  And, I beseech you, come again to-morrow.\r\n  What shall you ask of me, that I'll deny;\r\n  That honour, saved, may upon asking give?\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ Nothing but this, your true love for my master.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ How with mine honour may I give him that\r\n  Which I have given to you?\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ I will acquit you.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Well, come again to-morrow: Fare thee well!\r\n\r\n                                                         [_Exit_ OLIVIA.\r\n\r\n                     _Enter_ SIR TOBY _and_ FABIAN.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Gentleman, heaven save thee.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ And you, sir.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what nature\r\nthe wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full\r\nof despight, bloody as the hunter, attends thee: dismount thy tuck, be\r\nyare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and\r\ndeadly.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ You mistake, sir; I am sure, no man hath any quarrel to me;\r\nmy remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to\r\nany man.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you\r\nhold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite\r\nhath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man\r\nwithal.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ I pray you, sir, what is he?\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ He is knight, dubb'd with unhack'd rapier, and on carpet\r\nconsideration: but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and bodies hath\r\nhe divorced three; and his incensement at this moment is so implacable,\r\nthat satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre: hob,\r\nnob, is his word; give 't or take 't.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ I will return, and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no\r\nfighter.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Back you shall not, unless you undertake that with me,\r\nwhich with as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on; or strip\r\nyour sword stark naked, (for meddle you must, that's certain,) or\r\nforswear to wear iron about you.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ This is as uncivil, as strange. I beseech you, do me this\r\ncourteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is; it\r\nis something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman\r\ntill my return.                                        [_Exit_ SIR TOBY.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ 'Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ I know, the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal\r\narbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ I beseech you, what manner of man is he?\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form,\r\nas you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is, indeed,\r\nsir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could\r\npossibly have found in any part of Illyria: Will you walk towards him? I\r\nwill make your peace with him, if I can.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one, that would\r\nrather go with sir priest, than sir knight: I care not who knows so much\r\nof my mettle.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SCENE II.\r\n\r\n                           OLIVIA'S _Garden_.\r\n\r\n        _Enter_ SIR TOBY, _with_ SIR ANDREW, _in a great fright_.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Why, man, he's a very devil;--\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Oh!\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ I have not seen such a virago. I had a pass with\r\nhim,--rapier, scabbard, and all,--and he gives me the stuck-in,----\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Oh!\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ With such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable: they\r\nsay, he has been fencer to the Sophy.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Plague on't, I'll not meddle with him.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce\r\nhold him yonder.\r\n\r\n    _Sir And._ Plague on't; an I thought he had been valiant, and so\r\ncunning in fence, I'd have seen him damn'd ere I had challenged him. Let\r\nhim let the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ I'll make the motion: Stand here, make a good show\r\non't.--[_Aside._] Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.\r\n\r\n                      _Enter_ FABIAN _and_ VIOLA.\r\n\r\nI have his horse [_To_ FABIAN.] to take up the quarrel; I have persuaded\r\nhim, the youth's a devil.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ [_To_ SIR TOBY.] He is as horribly conceited of him; and\r\npants, as if a bear were at his heels.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ [_To_ VIOLA.] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight with\r\nyou for his oath sake: marry, he hath better bethought him of his\r\nquarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore\r\ndraw, for the supportance of his vow; he protests, he will not hurt you.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ [_Draws her Sword._] Pray heaven defend me!--[_Aside._] A\r\nlittle thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ [_To_ VIOLA.] Give ground, if you see him furious.\r\n\r\n    _Sir To._ Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman will,\r\nfor his honour's sake, have one bout with you: he cannot by the duello\r\navoid it: but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he\r\nwill not hurt you.

[_They embrace._\r\n\r\n    _Seb._ [_To_ OLIVIA.] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,\r\n  I shall have share in this most happy wreck:--\r\n  Boy, [_To_ VIOLA.] thou hast said to me a thousand times,\r\n  Thou never should'st love woman like to me.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ And all those sayings will I over-swear;\r\n  And all those swearings keep as true in soul,\r\n  As doth that orbed continent the fire\r\n  That severs day from night.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Give me thy hand;\r\n  And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.\r\n\r\n    _Vio._ The captain, that did bring me first on shore,\r\n  Hath my maid's garments: he, upon some action,\r\n  Is now in durance; at Malvolio's suit,\r\n  A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ He shall enlarge him:--Fetch Malvolio hither:--\r\n  And yet, alas, now I remember me,\r\n  They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.\r\n\r\n               _Enter_ CLOWN, _with a Letter, and_ FABIAN.\r\n\r\n  How does Malvolio, sirrah?\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave's end, as well\r\nas a man in his case may do: he has here writ a letter to you: I\r\nshould have given it you to-day morning; but as a madman's epistles\r\nare no gospels, so it skills not much, when they are deliver'd.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Open it, and read it.\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Look then to be well edified, when the fool delivers the\r\nmadman: [_Reads._] _By the Lord, madam_,--\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ How now! art thou mad?\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ No, madam, I do but read madness.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ [_To_ FABIAN.] Read it you, sirrah.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ [READS.] _By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world\r\nshall know it: though you have put me into darkness, and given your\r\ndrunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as\r\nwell as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the\r\nsemblance I put on; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much\r\nright, or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty\r\na little unthought of, and speak out of my injury._\r\n                                           _The madly-used_ MALVOLIO.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Did he write this?\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Ay, madam.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ This savours not much of distraction.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.\r\n\r\n                                                         [_Exit_ FABIAN.\r\n\r\n  My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,\r\n  To think me as well a sister as a wife,\r\n  One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,\r\n  Here at my house.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.--\r\n  Your master quits you; [_To_ VIOLA.] and, for your service done him,\r\n  Here is my hand; you shall from this time be\r\n  Your master's mistress.\r\n\r\n             _Enter_ MALVOLIO, _with a Letter, and_ FABIAN.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ Is this the madman?\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Ay, my lord, this same:\r\n  How now, Malvolio?\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Madam, you have done me wrong,\r\n  Notorious wrong.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Have I, Malvolio? no.\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that\r\n        letter:                            [_Gives_ OLIVIA _the Letter_.\r\n  You must not now deny it is your hand;--\r\n  (Write from it, if you can, in hand, or phrase;)--\r\n  Or, say, 'tis not your seal, nor your invention.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing;\r\n  Though, I confess, much like the character:\r\n  But, out of question, 'tis Maria's hand:--\r\n  And now I do bethink me, it was she\r\n  First told me, thou wast mad:--\r\n  Pr'ythee, be content:\r\n  This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee:\r\n  But, when we know the grounds and authors of it,\r\n  Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge\r\n  Of thine own cause.\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Good madam, hear me speak:\r\n  I do confess, Sir Toby, and myself,\r\n  Set this device against Malvolio here,\r\n  Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts\r\n  We had conceived against him: Maria writ\r\n  The letter, at Sir Toby's great importance;\r\n  In recompense whereof, he hath married her:\r\n  How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,\r\n  May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;\r\n  If that the injuries be justly weigh'd,\r\n  That have on both sides pass'd.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ Alas, poor fool! how have they baffled thee!\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Malvolio!--\r\n\r\n    _Clo._ Why,--_Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some\r\nhave greatness thrust upon them_--I was one, sir, in this interlude;\r\none Sir Topas, sir:--_By the Lord fool, I am not mad_:--But do you\r\nremember? _Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? an you\r\nsmile not, he's gagg'd_:--And thus the whirligig of time brings in\r\nhis revenges.--Ha, ha, ha!\r\n\r\n    _Fab._ Ha, ha, ha!--\r\n\r\n    _Mal._ I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.\r\n\r\n                                                       [_Exit_ MALVOLIO.\r\n\r\n    _Oli._ He hath been most notoriously abused.\r\n  Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace.\r\n\r\n                                                         [_Exit_ FABIAN.\r\n\r\n    _Duke._ He hath not told us of the captain yet;\r\n  When that is known, and golden time convents,\r\n  A solemn combination shall be made\r\n  Of our dear souls:--Meantime, sweet sister,\r\n  We will not part from hence--Go, officers;\r\n  We do discharge you of your prisoner.              [_Exeunt Officers._\r\n  Antonio, thou hast well deserved our thanks:\r\n  Thy kind protection of Cesario's person,\r\n  (Although thou knew'st not then for whom thou fought'st,)\r\n  Merits our favour: Henceforth, be forgotten\r\n  All cause of anger: Thou hast a noble spirit,\r\n  And as Sebastian's friend be ever near him.--\r\n  Cesario, come;\r\n  For so you shall be, while you are a man;\r\n  But, when in other habits you are seen,\r\n  Orsino's mistress, and his fancy's queen.\r\n\r\n                         _The Clown sings._\r\n\r\n      _When that I was and a little tiny boy,\r\n        With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n      A foolish thing was but a toy;\r\n        For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n      _But when I came to man's estate,\r\n        With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n      'Gainst knave and thief men shut their gate;\r\n        For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n      _But when I came, alas! to wive,\r\n        With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n      By swaggering could I never thrive;\r\n        For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n      _But when I came unto my bed,\r\n        With hey, ho, the wind, and the rain,\r\n      With toss pots still had drunken head;\r\n        For the rain it raineth every day._\r\n\r\n      _A great while ago the world begun,\r\n        With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\r\n      But that's all one, our play is done,\r\n        And we'll strive to please you every day._\r\n                                                                [Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber Notes:\r\n\r\nPassages in italics were indicated by _underscores_.\r\n\r\nSmall caps were replaced with ALL CAPS.\r\n\r\nThroughout the document, the oe ligature was replaced with \"oe\".\r\n\r\nThe character tags were italizied, even when before italizied text.\r\n\r\nThroughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of\r\nthe speakers.
