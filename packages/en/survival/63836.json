BAREFOOT\r\n\r\n             _Out of the far reaches of the universe sped\r\n           the meteor swarm, cosmic question marks destined\r\n          for annihilation in the sun. But one, approximately\r\n               half a pound of frozen destruction, had a\r\n              rendezvous near Japetus with Spaceboat 6._\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories March 1954.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was comfortably cool in the functional, little control room, but\r\nMorley was sweating, gently and steadily. His palms were wet, and the\r\nthin thoughtful face, shining in the glow of the instrument panel\r\nlight, was wrinkled in an agony of concentration and doubt. He was\r\ntrying to choose between the Scylla of waking Madsen with a corollary\r\nof biting contempt involved, and the Charybdis of attempting to land\r\nsingle handed on Japetus, less than five hundred miles below. Neither\r\ncourse was appealing.\r\n\r\nFor the hundredth time he pondered miserably over the sad condition\r\nof what had been a reasonably well ordered existence. The worst of\r\nit was that he had only himself to blame, and he knew it. No one had\r\nforced him to leave a comfortable, if poorly paid position with General\r\nPlastics, and fill out an employment card at Satellites, Inc.\r\n\r\nHe could not explain the obscure compulsion that sparked his little\r\npersonal rebellion.\r\n\r\nHe didn't know, or need to know that other generations of Morleys had\r\nfought in revolutions, or sailed in square riggers, or clawed gold from\r\nmountainsides. When he went to the spaceline, the puzzlement of his few\r\nfriends was profound, but hardly more so than his own. And now, after\r\nalmost a year of upheaval and change, he was piloting a spaceboat along\r\nan involute curve ending on the surface of Saturn's eighth moon. And he\r\nwas still puzzled.\r\n\r\nSatellites, Inc., had done as well as possible with the raw material\r\nknown as Morley, Vincent, No. 4628. His psychograph indicated a born\r\nsubordinate, with a normal I.Q., reasonably stable and trustworthy\r\nthough below average in initiative. They didn't inform him of this,\r\nor the fact that they had analyzed the neurosis which had driven\r\nhim to the spaceline, and which had created by that very action the\r\ntherapeutic aid he needed. Many spacemen had similar case histories.\r\n\r\nIt was those who fought the compulsion who sometimes turned down dark\r\npathways of the mind.\r\n\r\nFor six months he attended cadet school, and graduated in due time,\r\nfourteenth in a class of fifty. The next day he was assigned as fourth\r\nengineman to the space freighter _Solarian_, bound to Port Ulysses,\r\nTitan, Saturn system, with a cargo of mining machinery and supplies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey blasted off from Chicago Spaceport on a raw March midnight. Just\r\nanother rocket take-off, routine stuff, now. But have you ever seen it?\r\nThe night, the wind, the distant city glow in the sky? On the strip\r\nsquats the massive bulk of the rocket, loading hatches closed, sealed\r\nport holes gleaming through the gusts of rain that sweep the field. In\r\nthe sound proofed spaceport control tower the officials are relaxed\r\nover coffee and cigarettes; their part is over; they sit watching.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the mighty shell on the field, chronometer hands reach the\r\ncalculated second, a circuit closes, relays chatter briefly. The rocket\r\nigniters are firing, flame billows over the field, a low rumble from\r\nthe tubes builds to a throbbing roar. Twenty miles away a housewife\r\nlooks up, a question on her face. Her husband listens and smiles. \"It's\r\nthe Saturn rocket. It's here in the paper, under Departures.\"\r\n\r\nOn the field the roar rises to an insane bellow of sound. Under the\r\nmighty jets, the ten feet of concrete and the solid earth beneath it\r\nare shaking. In the insulated control tower a water glass dances in its\r\nholder. The watchers are not relaxed now; they lean forward.\r\n\r\nIt's old stuff, routine, precalculated to a fraction of a second,\r\nbut--watch. There--a stir--movement. Slowly at first, with a deliberate\r\nand awful majesty, then faster and faster.\r\n\r\nStraight toward the zenith the ship rises, trailing fire. Faster yet,\r\nhurling herself upward, under full power, through the last threads of\r\natmosphere. Upward and onward, out past Roches limit, out where gravity\r\ndwindles toward zero, into the empyrean where the shades of dead\r\nspacemen cruise the cosmos in their phantom craft, spaceborne in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAfter he had recovered from the pangs of his initial attack of space\r\nnausea, Morley enjoyed himself. He had one minor social asset, a\r\nretentive mind, well stocked with general information. If the two\r\napprentices got involved in an argument over the identity of the\r\nhighest peak in America, Morley was the inevitable arbiter. He could\r\nwith equal facility name the author of a recent best seller, or inform\r\nyou that a young seal was a cub, a young hare, a leveret, and a young\r\nswan, a cygnet.\r\n\r\nHe was fairly popular with the crew, except for a big Norwegian from\r\nNew York, named Olaf Madsen. Madsen was a chunky, hard bitten veteran\r\nof the spaceways. Round faced, deceptively soft spoken, he had a\r\npenchant for practical jokes, and a flair for biting sarcasm which\r\nfound full expression in the presence of any first tripper. He made\r\nthe life of any apprentice miserable, and finished the last two weeks\r\nof one trip in the brig for panicking an entire crew by painting his\r\nface to resemble the onset of Martian blue fever. Morley considered him\r\nan oaf, and he considered Morley a human filing cabinet with a weak\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nA little notice on the bulletin board was Morley's first inkling that\r\nhis safe, secure routine was on the verge of mutating into something\r\nfrighteningly unpredictable.\r\n\r\n\"All personnel not on duty will report to the recreation room at 1900\r\nhours, Solar time, to draw for side trip partners and destinations,\"\r\nit read.\r\n\r\nHe buttonholed the crew messman. \"What's all this about side trips,\r\nOscar?\"\r\n\r\nRoly poly Oscar looked at him incredulously. \"The lay over trips. The\r\ntime killer. On the level, don't you know?\"\r\n\r\nMorley shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Oscar told him, \"We leave Earth shortly before Saturn is in\r\nopposition. They figure on the shortest possible run, which takes three\r\nmonths. If we discharge and start right back, the round trip would take\r\nabout six months. That's fine, except that the synodic period for Earth\r\nand Saturn--Hey, you know what I'm talking about?\"\r\n\r\nMorley admitted his ignorance, vaguely annoyed at the fact that for\r\nonce he was the humble seeker for information, and someone else was\r\nbeing professorial.\r\n\r\nOscar grinned. \"And you studied astrogation! Well, when Saturn and\r\nEarth line up with the Sun, it takes three hundred and seventy eight\r\ndays before they get in the same position again. So if we got back to\r\nEarth's orbit in six months, we'd still have about a hundred and eighty\r\nmillions of miles to go, because Earth would be on Sol's other side at\r\nthat time, in superior conjunction to Uranus.\"\r\n\r\nMorley digested this, while Oscar basked in the light of his own\r\nknowledge, enjoying himself hugely.\r\n\r\n\"And the trips, Oscar?\"\r\n\r\n\"We lay over three or four months, 'til opposition time isn't too\r\nfar away, and we pick partners and destinations by lot, and go out\r\nto Saturn's other moons on prospecting trips--ore deposits, jewels,\r\nbotanical specimens, etc.--half for us, and half for the Company. It's\r\na good deal, a regular vacation, and those two-men craft are sweet\r\nstuff. And if you're lucky--\"\r\n\r\nHe went on, but Morley heard no more. The prospect unnerved him. He\r\nwas terrified at the idea of changing a safe subordinate position for\r\nthat of an active partner, however temporary the arrangement might be.\r\nAt the drawing, his hunch of impending misery proved all too real. He\r\nwound up facing the prospect of a stay on the frozen hell of Phoebe,\r\nscouring the miniature mountains for Japori crystals, with Madsen,\r\nMADSEN! for his only companion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA week later the Solarian teetered down to a landing at Port Ulysses.\r\nWith various expressions of profane and unbounded delight from her\r\ncrew, she was turned over to the stevedores and the maintenance gang.\r\nThereafter, at intervals, the thirty foot space boats took off for\r\nMimas, Tethys, Dione, or whatever waystop the lottery had decreed.\r\nMadsen and Morley left on the fourth 'night,' with Phoebe hardly a\r\nweek's run from them at ten miles a second.\r\n\r\nMadsen was at the controls. Without a single spoken word on the\r\nsubject, he was automatically the captain, and Morley, the crew. The\r\nsituation crystallized twenty-four hours out of Port Ulysses. Morley\r\nwas poring over the Ephemeris prior to taking his watch at the controls\r\nwhen he became aware that Madsen, red faced and breathing heavily, was\r\npeering over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nMorley stiffened in alarm. \"Is anything--\" He quailed under Madsen's\r\nglare.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, but there's liable to be if you don't smarten up.\" The\r\nNorwegian's blunt forefinger stabbed at the page Morley had been\r\nstudying. \"Phoebe, Mister, happens to be Saturn's NINTH moon. Get it?\r\nYou can count, can't you?\"\r\n\r\nMorley flushed, and fumbled miserably for a reasonable excuse. There\r\nwas a gleam of contempt in Madsen's eyes, but he spoke again more\r\nquietly. \"I'm going to eat and catch up on some sack time. We'll be\r\nright on top of Japetus in short order. It's a known fact that the moon\r\nwon't move over if you fly at it, so you better wake me up to handle\r\nthe compensating!\" He disappeared into the tiny galley, but his words\r\nwere still audible. \"It's an awful long walk back, chum, if anybody\r\npulls a bull.\"\r\n\r\nMorley swung himself into the pilot's seat, too numb with humiliation\r\nto answer. Almost an hour passed before he started the regulation\r\ncheckup required by the Space Code of any ship passing within one\r\nhundred thousand miles of a planet or major satellite. Every guardian\r\nneedle stood in its normal place with one exception. The craft had been\r\nrunning on the port fuel tanks, depleting them to the point where it\r\nseemed wise to trim ship. Morley opened the valve, touched the fuel\r\npump switch and waited, nothing happened. He watched the needles\r\nincredulously. The pump--? He jabbed the switch, once, twice. Nothing.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and rapped the starboard gauge with his knuckles,\r\nsharply. The needle swung from Full to Empty. Morley felt faint as\r\nrealization hit him. The starboard gauge had stuck at Full, and had\r\nbeen unreported. The tank had not been serviced in port, owing to\r\nthe faulty reading and a mechanic's carelessness. They had about two\r\nhours fuel. Even to Morley, it was obvious that there was one thing\r\nonly to do--land on Japetus, looming up larger in the view-plate with\r\neach passing moment. He checked the distance rapidly, punched the\r\ncalculator, and put the ship in the designated orbit. He wanted to\r\nhandle the landing himself, but the thought of the final few ticklish\r\nmoments chilled him. So did the thought of waking Madsen, and asking\r\nhim to take over.\r\n\r\nAnd it was then, at the intersection of two courses formed by an\r\ninfinity of variables, that two objects arrived in the same millisecond\r\nof time. Eight ounces of nickel iron smashed into the stern of\r\nSpaceboat 6, ripped a path of ruin through her entire length, and went\r\nout through the two inch glass of her bow, before Morley could turn\r\nhis head. He was aware, in a strange dream-like way, of actuating\r\nthe midships airtight door, of the hiss of air as the little aneroid\r\nautomatically opened valves to compensate for the drop in pressure, and\r\nof Madsen leaping into the control room and slapping a Johnson patch\r\nover the hole in the bow.\r\n\r\nMadsen was white but composed. \"We can slow her down but we can't land\r\nher. Get suits while I take over. We'll ride as far as we can, and\r\nwalk the rest of the way.\" He fought with the controls, as Morley,\r\nstill bemused, obeyed. At twenty-five hundred feet they bailed out,\r\nand floating down seconds later, watched Spaceboat 6 crash into a low\r\nwooded hill. And when they landed, and inspected the wreckage, it was\r\nsome minutes before either spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious at a glance that Spaceboat 6 was ready for the boneyard,\r\nhad there been one around. The ship, under the few automatic controls\r\nthat were still functioning, had sliced in at a thirty degree angle,\r\nploughed a short distance through a growth of slim, poplar-like trees,\r\nand then crumpled completely against an outcropping granite ledge.\r\nFinally Morley gulped audibly, and Madsen laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mastermind, any suggestions that might help us? Any little\r\npearls of wisdom from the great brain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just one,\" Morley answered. \"Head for the Equator, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And try to find a D.D. Correct. If we last that long. Let's salvage\r\nwhat we can out of this junk and shove off.\"\r\n\r\nMorley cleared his throat diffidently. \"There are a few pieces of\r\nequipment we should take along, for--er--emergencies--\" His voice\r\ntrailed off miserably under Madsen's basilisk stare.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Morley, once and for all. We're lugging essentials and that's\r\nall. Any extra weight is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, listen--\"\r\n\r\nMadsen ignored the interruption, and cut loose with one last broadside.\r\n\"Save your breath. It's bad enough being saddled with a useless little\r\nsquirt like you, without being made into a pack mule unnecessarily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nHe climbed into a gaping hole in the bow. Morley followed, humiliated\r\nbut still thinking hard. Catalogue it, he told himself. Remember\r\neverything. The Distress Depots, or D.D.'s, as spacemen called them,\r\nwere studded on every frontier world, usually on the Equator. They\r\ncontained two small spacecraft plus ample supplies of food, medicine,\r\nand tools. When wrecked, get to a D.D. and live. It was that simple.\r\n\r\nThey spent an hour worming their way through the shambles that had\r\nbeen the well ordered interior of Spaceboat 6, before emerging to take\r\nstock of their loot on the ground outside. Both men knew that they\r\nwere pitifully equipped to cover several hundred miles, on foot, in\r\na completely hostile environment. Suddenly Madsen looked up from the\r\nsextant he was examining.\r\n\r\n\"How come this gravity, Brain? I weigh about a hundred right now, I\r\nfigure, and that's too much, by plenty. Japetus isn't a quarter the\r\nsize of our moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's supposed to have a core of heavy radioactive metals,\" said\r\nMorley, thoughtfully, \"and a corresponding high density. Keeps it warm\r\nanyway, instead of a big icicle, like Phoebe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Phoebe!\" Madsen laughed. \"I remember, back in '89--\" He stopped\r\nabruptly at a rattling from the ledge. A green, little lizard-like\r\ncreature was scrambling frantically over the granite, while hot in\r\npursuit were three--spiders? Black, they were, a black like living\r\nvelvet, and incredibly fast as they closed in, beady stalked eyes\r\nfastened on their prey. They were deliberately herding the desperate\r\nlizard toward a cleft in the rock. As the creature leaped into the\r\nopening, another spider dove at it from the recess. The others closed\r\nin. There was a hopeless hissing, a vicious clicking of mandibles. The\r\nstruggle subsided. Once again the day was silent. Madsen holstered the\r\nblaster he had drawn and looked whitely at Morley.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasant pets,\" he grunted.\r\n\r\n\"Poisonous and carnivorous, too,\" said Morley, shakingly. \"I remember\r\nreading that Valdez dissected one when he first landed here twenty\r\nyears ago. One of his crew was bitten, and died in less than five\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen was thoughtful. \"We could stand a little briefing on the local\r\nflora and fauna, but palaver won't get us to the Equator. And that\r\nlittle stock treatise entitled 'Physical Attributes of Phoebe' is worse\r\nthan useless. Lucky the sextant is O.K., we can at least check our\r\nlatitude. There's just one flaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way do we go when we hit the line? The D.D.'s are spaced ninety\r\ndegrees apart. We might be within a hundred miles of one. If we head\r\nthe wrong way, we'd have three or four hundred miles to go. There's no\r\nmethod of figuring our longitude.\"\r\n\r\nMorley was staring sunward, with thoughtful eyes. \"Yes, there is,\" he\r\nsaid quietly.\r\n\r\nMadsen's jaw dropped. \"Give,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We both forgot something we know perfectly well. Notice the sun? It\r\nhasn't moved perceptibly since we landed. Japetus doesn't revolve on\r\nits axis.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two things. One, no night, since we're on the sunward side. The sun\r\nwill move from side to side in the sky, reaching its lateral limits\r\nwhen Japetus is in quadrature in regard to Saturn. If we were here for\r\na month, we'd see Saturn rise, make a full arc through the sky, and\r\nset. Let's hope for a shorter stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Madsen, and suddenly there was nothing patronizing or\r\nscornful in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Two. We came in over the Pole almost exactly at inferior conjunction.\r\nRight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I get it.\" Madsen answered slowly.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Morley was silent. He could almost smell the dingy\r\nclassroom in Port Chicago, almost see the words on the examination\r\npaper in front of him. The paragraph leaped out, limned sharply in his\r\nmind. \"Section 4, Subhead A, Solar Space Code. The initial Distress\r\nDepot on any satellite shall be situated, when practical, on the\r\nPrime Meridian. For the purposes of this act, the Prime Meridian of a\r\nsatellite shall be the meridian that bisects the Sun when the Satellite\r\nis in inferior conjunction. Quarter mile belts shall be burned fifty\r\nmiles to the North, South, East, and West as guides. Radio beacons will\r\noperate, unless impracticable due to atmospheric conditions, or other\r\nreasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're on, or practically on the Prime Meridian right now,\" said\r\nMadsen. \"A trek due South should hit D.D. No. 1 square on the nose.\r\nRight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. Two or three hundred miles to go. We might make it in two\r\nweeks.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen squinted at the stationary disk of Sol, hanging in the sky.\r\n\"Let's load up and get started. The sooner we're on our way, the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nBoth men had discarded their space suits, were dressed in the gray\r\nwork clothes of Satellites, Inc. Equipment was easily divided. Each\r\nhad a blaster, and a wrist compass-chronometer. Radio was useless on\r\nJapetus, and the little headsets were ruthlessly jettisoned. The flat\r\ntins of emergency food concentrate were stowed in two knapsacks. Madsen\r\ntook charge of the sextant, and Morley carried a lightweight repeating\r\nrifle for possible game that might be out of blaster range. Canteens,\r\na pocket first-aid kit, and a small heliograph, were the final items,\r\nexcept for several articles which Morley unobtrusively stowed away\r\nabout his person.\r\n\r\nLess than three hours after the crash, the two men shouldered their\r\nburdens, took a bearing to determine their course, and headed into the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a matter of minutes Spaceboat 6 was out of sight. With Madsen\r\nleading, they threaded their way through the scant undergrowth.\r\nUnderfoot the dry, broad-bladed grass rustled through a morning that\r\nhad no beginning or end. Farther away were other and less easily\r\nexplained rustlings, and once both men froze as a half-dozen of what\r\nlooked like baby dragons arrowed past within yards of them.\r\n\r\n\"Formation flying, like ducks,\" muttered Morley, watching from the\r\ncorner of his eye.\r\n\r\nWhen the whispering of scaled wings had died away, the castaways\r\nresumed their steady plodding into the south. Twice they crossed small\r\nfresh water brooks, providing a welcome opportunity to drink their\r\nfill, and replenish the canteens. The going was easy, since the footing\r\nwas in fairly dense soil, and the scrub was not so thick as to provide\r\nany difficulties. After eight hours of nearly continuous travel, they\r\nreached the banks of a third stream. Here Madsen stopped, and dropped\r\nhis knapsack to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Campsite,\" he grunted.\r\n\r\n\"Alabama,\" Morley murmured.\r\n\r\nMadsen goggled. \"Are you delirious? What do you mean--Alabama?\"\r\n\r\nMorley laughed sheepishly. \"Alabama means 'Here we rest,' I said it\r\nwithout thinking.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen was grinning now. \"What beats me is how you remember all that\r\njunk. I'd go nuts if I tried to clutter up my mind with a bunch of\r\nuseless data. Alabama!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to try to remember things,\" Morley said thoughtfully. \"If\r\nI read or hear something that seems the least bit curious or unusual,\r\nit just sticks. And sometimes it's useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, remember when Storybook ran a mile last year in 1.29? He was\r\nthe first to break 1.30. Some joe that knew a lot about horses gave me\r\nan argument in a bar about the first horse to break 1.40. He bet me\r\nten credits it was Man o' War. I knew it was Ten Broeck, and I got an\r\nalmanac and proved it.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen looked up from the tin of coffee concentrate he was opening.\r\n\"Hasn't anyone ever tried to win an argument by poking you one in the\r\nsnoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once or twice.\" Morley was almost apologetic. \"But I learned judo a\r\nfew years ago, just for the hell of it, so I didn't get hurt much.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a whiz with the sabre, no doubt?\" said Madsen dryly.\r\n\r\n\"No, I tried swordplay for a while, but gave it up. It's a little too,\r\ner--primitive for my tastes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Primitive!\" Madsen glanced around at the alien scene and nearly\r\nchoked. \"I'm crossing my fingers, but what would you do if some\r\ncarnivore, or a gang of those spiders suddenly appeared and started for\r\nus with evil intentions?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I'd run,\" said Morley simply. \"It was pretty dull at General\r\nPlastic but at least the comptometers weren't man-eating.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen blinked, and seeming to find expression difficult, forbore to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThey ate, and relaxed on the soft sod, lulled almost into a feeling\r\nof security. Not being foolhardy, however, they slept in six hour\r\nshifts. Morley stood the first watch, and slept the second. When he\r\nawoke, Madsen was tensely examining a ration tin. Jarred into instant\r\nalertness by a feeling of urgency and alarm, Morley leaped to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Something wrong?\"\r\n\r\nWithout answering, Madsen handed him the tin. It was pockmarked with\r\ninch wide patches of metallic gray fungus, from several of which liquid\r\nwas seeping. There was a sharp odor of decay.\r\n\r\nMadsen was hastily dumping the contents of the knapsacks on the ground.\r\nMorley joined him, and both men commenced scraping the clinging gray\r\npatches from the tins. All but three were perforated and ruined.\r\n\r\n\"We'll at least be traveling light from now on,\" Madsen said. \"Any idea\r\nwhat this stuff is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of that lichen, or whatever it is, was around the scene of the\r\ncrash,\" Morley answered. \"The stuff must have an affinity for tin;\r\nprobably secretes some acid that dissolves it. Only trouble is, it goes\r\nthrough thin steel too.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen commenced repacking their effects.\r\n\r\n\"From now on, laddie, keep your eyes peeled for game, and if you see\r\nany, use that rifle. If we don't knock down some meat, and soon, we\r\naren't going to make it. Might as well realize it right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you ever wrecked before, Madsen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once, on Venus. Cartographic expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tubes blew and we made a forced landing. Wound up sitting in the\r\nmiddle of a pile of highgrade scrap.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do then?\"\r\n\r\nMadsen shouldered his knapsack and smiled condescendingly.\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing, Mr. Fix-it. We didn't have to. Since I seem to have\r\naccidentally stumbled on something new and strange to you, add this to\r\nyour files. It's usual on cartographic trips of any length, for one\r\nship to go out, while another stays at a temporary base, and keeps in\r\nconstant directional radio contact. If anything happens, they come\r\na-running. Makes it fine for us uninformed common people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, this is somewhat different. If we don't get out by\r\nourselves, whoever finds us need only say, 'X marks the spot.'\"\r\n\r\nMorley didn't bother answering. No comment was necessary. He knew as\r\nwell as Madsen that whatever margin of safety they possessed had been\r\nshaved to the vanishing point.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey made twenty miles in a forced march, slept, ate, and then traveled\r\nagain. The stunted forest grew thinner, and occasionally they crossed\r\nopen spaces acres in extent. Twice they saw, in the distance, animals\r\nresembling terrestrial deer, and on the second occasion Morley tried\r\na fruitless shot. They slept and ate again, and now the last of the\r\nrations were gone. They went on.\r\n\r\nAs they made southing, the dull sun crept higher in the sky by\r\ninfinitesimal degrees. Now the going became tougher. Patches of evil\r\nlooking muskeg began to appear in the scrub, and the stunted trees\r\nthemselves gradually gave way to six foot ferns. There were occasional\r\nsigns that some creature had been foraging on the lush growth. When\r\nthey found fresh tracks in the soft footing, Morley unlimbered the\r\nrifle, and the two men trod more softly. By that time either would have\r\ncheerfully made a meal on one of the miniature flying dragons, alive\r\nand kicking, and the thought of a juicy steak from some local herbivore\r\nwas as soul stirring as the sight of Mecca to a true believer.\r\n\r\nBoth men whirled at a sudden crashing on their left. Something like a\r\nlarge splay footed kangaroo broke cover, and went loping away, clearing\r\nthe fern tops at every bound. In one motion Morley whipped up the\r\nrifle and fired. There was an earsplitting report, the leaper kept\r\nright on going, under forced draught, and the two castaways stared in\r\nconsternation at a rifle that resembled a bundle of metallic macaroni\r\nmore than it did a firearm.\r\n\r\nMadsen spoke first. \"You probably got some mud in the barrel when we\r\nstopped last time,\" he accused. \"Look at us now.\"\r\n\r\nMorley started to mumble an apology, but Madsen cut him short. \"Look at\r\nus now,\" he repeated, with all stops out. \"It was bad before, now it's\r\npractically hopeless. Our only long range gun! What do we do now if we\r\ndo find game--dig pits for it?\"\r\n\r\nIf a man can be said to slink without changing his position, Morley\r\nslunk. Madsen continued, double fortissimo.\r\n\r\n\"A kid of ten knows enough to keep a gun clean, but you, Mr.--Mr.\r\nUnabridged Webster in the flesh--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, temporarily out of breath. Morley regarded him abjectly,\r\nand suddenly Madsen began to feel a little ashamed. After all, the\r\nfellow had figured out that business about the meridian.\r\n\r\n\"No use in having any post mortems,\" he said, with fine logic. \"Throw\r\nthat junk away. It's that much less to carry, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, they plodded wearily through the last of the swamp\r\nonto higher ground. The two haggard, muddied figures that threw\r\nthemselves on the dry soil to rest bore little resemblance to the men\r\nwho had parachuted from Spaceboat 6 seventy-two hours before.\r\n\r\nThe slope on which they rested was tufted with small bushes. One\r\nparticular type with narrow dark green leaves bore clusters of fruit\r\nlike small plums, which Madsen eyed speculatively.\r\n\r\n\"Do we risk it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Might as well.\"\r\n\r\nMorley was completely unaware that he had just accepted the\r\nresponsibility for making a decision.\r\n\r\n\"We can't afford not to risk it,\" he said, adding, with little show of\r\nenthusiasm, \"I'll be the guinea pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, chum,\" Madsen countered. \"We'll match for it.\"\r\n\r\nThey matched and Morley called it wrong. He plucked a sample of the\r\nfruit and stood regarding it like some bewhiskered Little Jack Horner.\r\nFinally he broke the thin skin with his thumbnail and gingerly conveyed\r\na couple of drops of juice to his tongue. The taste was simultaneously\r\noily and faintly sweet, and after a short wait he essayed a fair\r\nsized bite. Madsen was about to follow suit, when Morley motioned him\r\nto wait. The next second he was rolling on the ground, coughing and\r\nchoking, while Madsen tried grimly to feed him water from a canteen.\r\n\r\nIt was no use. The throat tissues became swollen and inflamed in\r\nseconds, to the point of agony, and swallowing was totally impossible.\r\nTo this was shortly added an overpowering nausea. When the retching\r\nfinally stopped, Morley tried to speak, but in vain. Even the effort\r\nmeant waves of pain.\r\n\r\nMadsen watched helplessly, and when the spasms of choking finally\r\nstopped, spoke gently.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be camping right here for a while, looks like. Try to get some\r\nsleep if it slacks off any. You'll be okay in a while.\"\r\n\r\nHis doubts were hidden, and Morley thanked him with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nAs the hours dragged on, Madsen sat quietly on guard, while the sick\r\nman tossed in uneasy slumber. The eternal day was comfortably warm, and\r\neventually the watcher closed his eyes. Just for a moment, he thought\r\ndrowsily, just for a nap. Head pillowed on his arm, he slept. The\r\nalien hillside was very quiet. He slept, dreaming of the long trip\r\nhome, of Port Chicago, of beer, and girls, and a fistfull of credits.\r\n\r\nWhen Madsen awoke, he knew instantly that something was out of key,\r\nthat some subtle change in the surroundings had triggered a warning\r\nbell in his subconscious. Without any sudden move, he cast an all\r\ninclusive glance over the surrounding terrain. Morley still slept, and\r\nthe scene seemed unchanged. But no! Wait! There on the fitful breeze\r\nthat had sprung up, that faint sweetish smell. He sniffed, facing\r\nupwind. What the devil was it? Frowning, he stared toward the crest of\r\nthe hill. There was one tree, a few rods away, that seemed different\r\nfrom the others. Larger, and the branches were whiplike, drooping. It\r\nlooked vaguely like a weeping willow on Earth. Madsen started toward\r\nit, walking softly. As he drew nearer, the scent became stronger, and\r\nnow he recognized it. Carrion! It was coming from the tree, and he was\r\nable to see the source.\r\n\r\nThe corpses of two or three scaled green lizards, and one of the\r\nlopers from the fern forest. The drooping limbs of the tree moved\r\nundulantly in the breeze, almost as if they possessed an awareness of\r\nhis approach, and he noticed that they were armed with two inch thorns.\r\nHe was very close now. He took another step, and then, without warning,\r\nevery nerve and muscle seemed to twist and contract violently. Blacking\r\nout between two breaths, he still realized what had happened. Once\r\nbefore, on Ceres, he had experienced the paralyzing effect of a blaster\r\nbolt from a weapon set at high aperture.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. Deep down in the blackness, in the solid dark, some\r\nwisp of consciousness stirred and quickened. It quested, as the black\r\nbecame gray. It flowered into life, Ego once again, suddenly aware of\r\nthe pale warm sunlight, and an intolerable aching. He looked up at\r\nMorley and cursed.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had to.\" Morley's voice was a harsh whisper. \"You'd have been a goner\r\nin another step or two, and I couldn't yell. That tree's deadly.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that's it.\" A pause. \"If you don't mind my asking, how did you\r\nknow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Remembered it from a picture in Valdez' book, when I saw you walking\r\ninto that--thing! Watch this.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up a chunk of shale, and lobbed it into the tree. The\r\nreaction was violent and immediate. The formerly quiescent limbs\r\nwhipped sinuously through the air, their thorny armament glinting in\r\nthe light. Madsen felt the back of his neck tingle at the hiss of their\r\npassage. Dozens of black, hornet-like insects took wing, and buzzed\r\nangrily and aimlessly around until the agitated motion subsided and the\r\ntree sank slowly into its former somnolence.\r\n\r\n\"How does it work?\" asked Madsen.\r\n\r\n\"The thorns, they're almost instantly lethal. Notice those wasps, or\r\nwhatever they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they live in those trees, and pollinate them. They lay eggs in\r\nthe game that the tree polishes off. When the larvae graduate and get\r\ntheir wings, they make a brief nuptial flight, and set up housekeeping\r\nin a similar tree. Other insects stay away. It's a beautiful case of\r\nhighly specialized symbiosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Funny, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very. You might say our position is similar, to a degree. How are\r\nyou feeling now?\"\r\n\r\n\"A lot better, except for the ache. Your throat seems to be coming\r\nalong all right, too.\" His eyes ranged the slope, estimating the\r\ndistance to their initial resting place. \"Man alive, I was lucky to be\r\nin range!\"\r\n\r\n\"You were at that, Madsen. There's just one chronic bug in energy\r\nweapons, the old law of inverse squares. Short range tools, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said it. Say, Morley--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't a symbiotic relationship usually refer to some type of\r\nparasitism? Sort of a put and take game, with one organism doing all\r\nthe putting, and the other, all the taking?\"\r\n\r\nCan it be? thought Morley, incredulously. Honest gratitude was natural,\r\nbut the idea that Madsen's granite exterior might conceal a slowly\r\nburgeoning respect--!\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" he said carefully. \"Often there is a mutual dependence,\r\nas with us. That's what I meant to say in the first place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. I feel, well, pretty foolish about being so careless, and\r\nholding us up. Not that I'd have gone on walking into that tree, mind\r\nyou. And I'd hate to have you think of me as a human--liana, or remora,\r\nor something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly. We're partners, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's true. Morley, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, a lot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er--that's all right. Skip it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mesa stretched to the horizon on all sides, timeless and\r\nforbidding, drowsing through the sunlit millennia. To a casual\r\ncelestial voyager, it would have appeared barren of life, except for\r\nthe two scarecrow figures which scrabbled in the sand in spots where\r\na stunted, ropy vine was growing. At intervals one or the other would\r\ntriumphantly dig out a baseball-sized melon like object, and wolf it\r\nhungrily, the juice dribbling over his bearded chin. The trail they\r\nhad made was blurred in spots where they had fallen, light-headed with\r\nweakness. The melons helped, though their caloric count would never\r\nconstitute a dietitian's dream of joy. They were food, of a sort, and\r\nmore important, water. Finally one of the figures scrambled to his\r\nfeet, and stared defiantly at the dim sun, higher now, but still far\r\nfrom the zenith.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get going,\" said Morley thickly.\r\n\r\nThe two men shambled silently through the knee-high grass and\r\ndwarf trees of the savannah. They didn't feel particularly hungry\r\nanymore. There was only a vaguely irritating condition of lassitude,\r\nand dizziness, and an annoying tendency of the knees to buckle\r\nuncontrollably without the slightest warning. They plodded on, weaving\r\nuncertainly from time to time. There was game here, creatures like\r\nantelope, but they maddeningly stayed well out of blaster range. Madsen\r\nhad discarded everything but his pack, while Morley's weapon still\r\nhung at his hip. With seemingly irrational stubbornness, he also clung\r\nto the impedimenta he had picked up at the wreck, despite Madsen's\r\npetulant remarks about excess weight.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Morley as if they had been traveling forever through\r\nsome grassy Gehenna. It grew harder and harder for him to think in\r\nlogical sequence. When he climbed painfully to his feet after a fall,\r\nhe had to fight back a sudden overwhelming urge to burst into babyish\r\ntears. Madsen hardly ever fell down. It didn't seem fair, and he wished\r\nbitterly that he were more like Madsen. Still he fought on without\r\nknowing why. Another step, and another, and a thousand more, each one\r\nan individual effort to which he forced his failing muscles.\r\n\r\nAnother eternity or two passed, and suddenly Madsen staggered and sat\r\ndown in his tracks. He stared resentfully at his knapsack and then\r\npeered up at Morley.\r\n\r\n\"We've still got four of those melon things. If we eat them now, we\r\nwon't have to carry them. How about it?\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\nThrough Morley's weariness crept a doubt as to the validity of his\r\ncomrade's logic, but it seemed to be too difficult to analyze at the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThey ate the scanty meal in silence, and rested for an hour, half\r\ncomatose. Then, somewhat refreshed, Morley levered himself slowly\r\nerect. He stirred Madsen with his toe.\r\n\r\n\"Up and at 'em, chum.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen blinked at him and started to rise. He was on one knee, when\r\nsuddenly, he turned his head in a listening attitude. Morley had heard\r\nthe distant hum, too, and was standing stock still, an anxious frown on\r\nhis gaunt face. Madsen was on the verge of scrambling to his feet, when\r\nMorley spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Don't move.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, for God's sake. Don't stir.\" He was trembling, his bony\r\nfeatures white as paper under their coating of grime. Madsen froze,\r\nwordless. Sailing through the tall grass, straight toward them, came\r\none of the gray antelope-like creatures. It passed within twenty feet.\r\nThey could see the heaving flanks, the foam on its muzzle, the rolling,\r\nterror stricken eyes. Close behind, and closing in rapidly, came the\r\norigin of the hum. It was a host of tiny iridescent flying creatures,\r\nno larger than bumblebees. They streaked by, green and crimson winged\r\ngems, the hum rising to a vicious crescendo.\r\n\r\nThe chase ended a hundred yards away. As the cloud struck, the antelope\r\nscreamed, a lone cry of agony and despair. It staggered once, tried\r\nto leap forward, staggered again, was down. There was a threshing, a\r\nviolent movement of the grass, then silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour passed before a rising hum announced the ending of\r\nthe feast. The component parts of the cloud took flight, coalesced into\r\na group, vanished into the distance.\r\n\r\nMadsen broke first, heading for the remains of the antelope, with\r\nMorley close behind. The animal lay in a heap, drained of every drop of\r\nblood, its punctured eyes staring sightlessly at the empty heavens.\r\n\r\n\"Meat,\" babbled Madsen. \"Chops, steak, liver, heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up,\" Morley said curtly, \"and start a fire.\" He bent to the\r\nbutchering.\r\n\r\nThey ate, new life flooding into them. They were suddenly deeply\r\nconscious of the incredible sensation of being fed, of resting with a\r\nfull stomach, of enjoying a reprieve that might be a pardon.\r\n\r\nMadsen stopped picking his teeth for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know what those things were?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Sangres, Valdez called them. Means bloody in Spanish. They're\r\nblood drinkers. There's one thing, though, you're pretty safe if you\r\ndon't move. Those sweet little birds--and they are birds, as a matter\r\nof fact--hunt by sight.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen was silent. Then he laughed, and turned to eye the remains of\r\nthe antelope fondly.\r\n\r\n\"And to think we didn't even have to bleed it,\" he said. \"When we get\r\nback, you might recommend some books for me to read, if you feel like\r\ndoing a good turn.\"\r\n\r\nMorley was laughing, too. \"It's a deal.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they resumed their trek, both knapsacks were loaded with meat,\r\ncut into strips, and well smoked. The travelers were staggering no\r\nlonger, though once again they were traversing rising ground. An\r\neight-hour march brought them to the summit. At their feet the ground\r\nfell away in a sharp slope, to level off a few miles in the distance,\r\nand there, flowing from the west and swinging in a broad arc directly\r\ninto the south, was the silvery sheen of a river. It seemed like a\r\ngreat question mark, its ends disappearing over the deceptively close\r\nhorizons of the little world.\r\n\r\nMadsen peered at the bright interrogative streak.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon my ignorance, pal, but is that river really flowing south, or\r\nam I dreaming?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not a dream. We've been coming over a watershed evidently.\"\r\n\r\n\"That should simplify matters. We get to the river, build a raft\r\nsomehow, if there's timber, and travel in luxury. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right.\"\r\n\r\nA few hours of easy travel brought them to the bank. For some time\r\nit had been evident that there would be ample material for a raft.\r\nNow Morley looked at the foot-thick trunks around them, and said\r\nthoughtfully, \"We'll have to work downstream and look for windfalls or\r\nsomething. We aren't equipped for lumberjack work.\"\r\n\r\nThey had paralleled the stream for some time when suddenly Madsen\r\nshouted in exultation.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\"\r\n\r\nThey were standing at a point of land at a juncture of the river and\r\nan evil looking backwater some twenty feet wide. It was bridged by one\r\nfallen trunk, and on the other side were several more, where a falling\r\ngiant had brought down his neighbors in his collapse.\r\n\r\nMadsen hastily started across the trunk which bridged the slough,\r\nignoring Morley's admonition to take it easy. Halfway across, a rotten\r\npiece of bark crumbled under his tread. He caught at the stub of a\r\nlimb, preventing a full length fall by a narrow margin, and wound up\r\nstanding in semi-liquid, knee deep mud. He had placed his hands on the\r\nfallen trunk, preparatory to climbing back on it, when, with hardly a\r\nwarning ripple, something flipped from the muddy surface and clamped\r\naround his wrist. Another slapped across his neck, and clung.\r\n\r\nMadsen tore at them in vain, waves of revulsion flooding him. The\r\nthings were inch-thick ribbons, a foot and a half long, and about\r\nsix inches wide, a mottled green in color. There was an unspeakable\r\nrepulsion about their touch, and they were coldly, clammily strong. Now\r\nthe surface of the slough was churning as the hideous swarm converged,\r\nand Madsen felt his strength fading as a light dims when an electrician\r\nturns a rheostat. He tried to keep fighting, but his muscles refused to\r\nanswer his will. Immobile, but fully conscious, with his insides a ball\r\nof cold horror, he waited.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Morley, on solid ground, was clawing the contents from his\r\nknapsack, scattering jerky on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe tableau on the bank was within Madsen's range of vision as he lay\r\nhalf immersed in mud, with the stomach-turning horrors greedily glueing\r\nthemselves to his exposed hands and face. To the sick helplessness with\r\nwhich he faced the end, was added a hopeless burning rage. What was\r\nMorley doing? Planning to offer the things some dried meat? A handful\r\nof near-leather for something that lusted and craved for hot blood?\r\nWhat a way to cash in. A living buffet dinner for alien monstrosities,\r\nwhile a white faced weak sister fumbled frantically, safely, in a\r\nuseless knapsack. A band of cold, hungry malignance fastened itself to\r\nhis forehead, just missing his left eye.\r\n\r\nDully, he watched Morley come up with something like a small\r\nflashlight, saw him thumb the switch, and commence crawling out on the\r\nlog to where Madsen lay half submerged. Once within range, he played\r\nthe invisible beam from the little device over Madsen's inert body.\r\nThe result was instantaneous. The giant leeches relaxed their grip and\r\ndisappeared under the mud with startling rapidity. Morley retched at a\r\nglimpse of a sucker-lined underbelly. Then he hooked his weapon on his\r\nbelt and dragged Madsen to dry land.\r\n\r\nThe victim's frantic eyes showed he was obviously conscious, though\r\nunable to move or speak. Morley promptly launched into a reassuring\r\nmonologue.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll be O.K. in a few hours. Those things temporarily\r\nshort circuit the nervous energy of their prey in some manner. They\r\ncall them sanguisuga, means bloodsucker. They're sensitive only to\r\nstrong ultraviolet, like a lot of extra-terrestrial life.\"\r\n\r\nHe removed the little projector from his belt.\r\n\r\n\"That's why I've been lugging this airlock disinfector all the way. I\r\nhad a hunch it might come in handy. And look.\"\r\n\r\nHe unbuttoned his shirt, exposing a length of thin cord coiled around\r\nhis waist.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't going to show you this, but now we can use it for lashings\r\nfor the raft we're going to build as soon as you're better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even a rope,\" said Madsen slowly. He articulated with difficulty, his\r\nnerves tingling with returning life.\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours later they were far to the South, floating down\r\nthe nameless river on their improvised raft. There was no feeling of\r\ncaptain and crew, now. Just two men, fighting together. And winning.\r\n\r\nThe sextant had long since been discarded, and both men were staring\r\nat a rickety tripod, from which a button was suspended by a piece of\r\nravelled thread. The shadow it cast was a dark dot. Madsen spoke first.\r\n\r\n\"You're quite a gadgeteer, aren't you. It's simple, at that. The closer\r\nwe are to the equator, the higher the sun, and the shorter the shadow.\r\nVoila!\"\r\n\r\nMorley laughed and stretched. The change in equilibrium set the little\r\npendulum to swinging gently, and he watched it intently as the motion\r\nslowly ceased.\r\n\r\n\"It's been that way for hours now. We should be nearly there.\"\r\n\r\nMadsen scanned the bank. \"Any time now, any time.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later they saw it. A quarter mile lane burned through the trees\r\nand shrubs, running straight as a string from the horizon to the river,\r\nand continuing on the other side. They beached the raft, in case the\r\nnecessity arose to cross back, and trudged until they came to the first\r\nmile marker. They were on the right side. The arrow pointed in the\r\ndirection they were going, and the enamelled sign said, simply,\r\n\r\n                          JAPETUS D.D. No. 1\r\n                                 12 m.\r\n                                19 km.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Madsen spoke. \"We made it, thanks to what you knew about\r\nJapetus. All those little things that added up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh those,\" said Morley. \"Just,\" he hesitated. \"Just--odds and ends.\"",
