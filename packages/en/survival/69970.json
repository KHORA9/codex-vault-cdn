I.\r\n\r\nHow the Husbandman shall iudge and fore-know all kinde of Weathers, and\r\nother seasons of the yeere.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough GOD out of his infinite prouidence, is the onely directer and\r\nruler of all things, gouerning the yéeres, dayes, minutes and seasons\r\nof the yeere according to the power of his Will: yet for as much as hee\r\nhath giuen vs his Creatures, and placed the Celestiall bodies to holde\r\ntheir influences in vs, and all things else which haue increasement,\r\nreuealing vnto vs from their motions, the alteration and qualities of\r\neuery season, it shall be very behouefull for euery Husbandman to know\r\nthe signes and tokens of euery particular season, as when it is likely\r\nto Raine, when Snow, when Thunder, when the Winds will rise, when the\r\nWinter will rage, & when the Frosts will haue the longest continuance,\r\nthat fashioning his labours, according to the temperature or\r\ndistemperature of the weather, hee may with good iudgement and aduise,\r\neschew many euils which succéede rash and vnfore-looking actions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Rayne.]\r\n\r\nTo speake then first of the generall signes of Raine, you shall\r\nvnderstand that the olde Husbandmen did obserue rules generall, and\r\nrules speciall: the generall rules were such as concerned eyther all,\r\nmost, or a great part of the whole yéere: the rules speciall, those\r\nwhich concerned dayes, houres, and times present: of which I will first\r\nspeake in this place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from Clouds.]\r\n\r\nIf therefore you shall at any time perceiue a Cloud rising from the\r\nlowest part of the Horizon, and that the maine body be blacke and\r\nthicke, and his beames (as it were) Curtaine-wise, extending vpward,\r\nand driuen before the windes: it is a certaine and infallible signe of\r\na present showre of Raine, yet but momentary and soone spent, or passed\r\nouer: but if the Cloud shall arise against the Winde, and as it were\r\nspread it selfe against the violence of the same, then shall the Raine\r\nbe of much longer continuance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from the Moone.]\r\n\r\nIf when you sée the new Moone appeare, you perceiue that some part\r\nof her Hornes are obscured, or if it be black, or discoulored in the\r\nmiddest: if it hang much to the West, if it be compast or girdled\r\nabout, eyther with thicke, or waterish transparent vapours: if it\r\nlooke more then ordinarily pale, or if it shall beginne to raine small\r\nand mist-like on the fourth or fift day of her age, all these are\r\ninfallible signes of Raine, and the last an assured signe that the\r\nRaine will continue all that quarter of the Moone following.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from the Sunne.]\r\n\r\nIf you shall sée the Sunne rise earely in the Morning, and spread forth\r\nhis Beames violently, yet with a very moyst and waterish complexion,\r\nand there-withall in the West you doe sée a bedde of thicke vapours to\r\narise, increase and ascend vpward, then shall you bee assured that at\r\nhigh noone, when those vapours and the Sunne shall méet, there will be\r\nraine, and that raine of no short continuance: If you shall sée the\r\nSunne rise red, and turne sodainely blacke, if it haue many red clouds\r\nabout it mixt with blackenesse, if it haue a spacious Circle about it,\r\nor if when it setteth you sée it fall behinde a banke of darke and\r\nblacke Cloudes, they be all most certaine and infallible signes of\r\nraine, which will presently follow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from the Lightning.]\r\n\r\nIf it

violence, much mortallitie shall fall amongst yong Children,\r\nand both Corne and Cattell shall be scarce, and of a déere reckoning:\r\nif it fall on the Saturday, the yéere shall be reasonably good and\r\nplentifull, onely the people of the world shall be excéeding peruerse,\r\n& much giuen to mutinie & dissention one against another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from the Sunne rising.]\r\n\r\nAgaine, if the Sunne rise without impediment, and shine bright and\r\ncléere vpon Christmas day, the yéere will be very plentifull: if it\r\nrise likewise cléere the second day in Christmas, then Corne will fall\r\nin price: if it rise cléere the third day in Christmas, there will\r\nonely be dissention in the Church: if on the fourth day, it foreshewes\r\ntrouble vnto yong persons: if on the fift day, it shewes that many\r\ngood things will increase: if on the sixt, doubtlesse euery Garden\r\nwill bring forth great plenty: if on the seauenth, then is much dearth\r\nand scarcitie to be feared: if it shine cléere on the eyght day in\r\nChristmas, then there is likely to be great store of Fish: if on the\r\nninth, it will doubtles proue a good yéere for all manner of Cattell:\r\nif on the tenth, the yéere is likely to yéeld much cause of mourning:\r\nif on the eleauenth, there will fall much fogges, thicke mistes, and\r\ngreat infection will follow after. Lastly, if the Sunne shine cléere\r\nthe twelfth day after Christmas, it fore-shewes much warre and troubles,\r\nwith great losse and bloudshed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from the twelue dayes in Christmas.]\r\n\r\nAgaine, according to these former obseruations, you shall vnderstand,\r\nthat what weather shall fall or be on the sixe and twentieth day of\r\nDecember, the like weather shall be all the moneth of Ianuary after,\r\nwhat shall be on the seauen and twentieth of December, the like shall\r\nbe all the moneth of February following: what weather shall be on the\r\neight and twentieth day of December, the like weather shall be all\r\nMarch following: what weather shall be the nine and twentieth day of\r\nDecember, the same shall be all Aprill after: what on the thirtieth,\r\nthe same all May: what on the one and thirtieth the like all Iune\r\nfollowing: what weather shall fall on the first of Ianuary, the same\r\nshall be all Iuly after: what on the second of Ianuary, the same all\r\nAugust after: what on the third, the same all September after: what on\r\nthe fourth, the same all October following: what on the fift, the same\r\nall Nouember after, and what weather shall fall on the sixt of Ianuary,\r\nwhich is Twelft-day, the same weather shall fall all December following.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from Saint _Pauls_ day.]\r\n\r\nAgaine, if Saint _Pauls_ day proue fayre, dry and bright, it\r\nforesheweth plenty of all things the yéere following: but if it be\r\nmisty then it shewes great dearth of Cattell. If there fall vpon that\r\nday Snow or Raine, then it shewes Famine and Want of Corne, but if it\r\nbe windy, tempestuous, or if it thunder, then it sheweth that great\r\nwarres will follow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from _Maudlin_, and Saint _Swythens_ day.]\r\n\r\nAgaine, looke what quantitie of raine falleth eyther on _Mary Maudlins_\r\nday, or on Saint _Swithens_ day, be it more or lesse, the same\r\nproportion will fall for the space of forty dayes after: but if these\r\ntwo dayes be fayre and dry all the time of Haruest will be so also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: If Corne shall be cheape or deare.]\r\n\r\nNow if you will know whether Corne shall be cheape or déere, take\r\ntwelue principall graynes of Wheate out of the strength of the eare,\r\nvpon the first day of Ianuary, and when the harth of your Chimney\r\nis most hot, swéepe it cleane, then make a stranger lay one of those\r\nGraynes on the hot hearth, then marke it well, and if it leape a\r\nlittle, Corne shall be reasonably cheape, but if it leape much then\r\nCorne shall be excéeding cheape, but if it lye still and moue not, then\r\nthe price of Corne shall stand, and continue still for that Moneth: and\r\nthus you shall vse your twelue Graines, the first day of euery Moneth\r\none after another, that is to say, euery Moneth one Graine, and you\r\nshall know the rising and falling of Corne in euery Moneth, all the\r\nyéere following.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes from Thunder.]\r\n\r\nIf it shall thunder much the first Sunday of the New-yéere, it shewes\r\ngreat death and mortallitie amongst learned men: if it thunder the\r\nfirst Munday, it shewes great death of women, and many Eclipses of the\r\nSunne: if it thunder on the first Tuesday, it shewes plenty of Corne,\r\nbut much Warre and dissention: if it thunder on the first Wednesday,\r\nit shewes mortallitie and death amongst the worst sort of people, both\r\nMale and Female, besides much Warre and bloudshed: if it thunder on the\r\nfirst Thursday in the New-yéere, it sheweth much plenty of Corne that\r\nwill follow: if it thunder on the first Friday, it betokeneth the losse\r\nof great personages, and men of authoritie, many affrayes and murthers,\r\nwith much perill and danger. Lastly, if it thunder vpon the first\r\nSaturday in the New-yéere, it foresheweth onely a generall plague and\r\ninfection, which shall raigne with strong violence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes of sicknes or health.]\r\n\r\nIf you shall perceiue the Summer and Spring time to fall out very\r\nmoyst and rainy, without winde, yet in their owne natures very hot &\r\nscortching, or if the Southerne or Southwest-winde blow much without\r\nraine: if many fogs and mists fall in the Morning, and ouercome the\r\nSunnes beames at noone also: if the Sunne suffer any large Eclipse:\r\nif Autumne and Winter be more foggy then moyst or cold: if the Dowe\r\nor Leauen, of which you mould your bread, doe quickely mould and\r\ncleaue together without labour: if Dogs runne madde, if Birds forsake\r\ntheir nests: if Shéepe rot: if Fennes, Marrish-grounds, and muddy\r\nplaces abound with Frogges: if Mud-wals bréede Swine lice or Sowes:\r\nif Moales forsake the earth: if the small Pocks or Meazels be rife\r\nand abound in the Spring time, or if women generally doe miscarry in\r\nchilde-bedde, any of these are most certaine signes of much sickenesse\r\nand mortallitie that will follow the yéere after: and all such signes\r\nas are directly contrarie to any of these, as if the Summer and Spring\r\ndoe fall out drye and windy: if the South or Southwest-winde bring with\r\nit euer rayne: if no fogs or mists oppresse the ayre, and so forth of\r\nall the rest which are before shewed, are most certaine and infallible\r\ntokens of a very wholesome and healthfull yéere, which will euer follow\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The preseruation of health.]\r\n\r\nNow for the preseruation of your health, and to preuent all such\r\nsickenesses as are incident to follow in these casuall and daungerous\r\nyéeres: through euery seuerall moneth in the yéere you shall obserue\r\nthese few precepts.\r\n\r\nFirst, in the month of Ianuary you shall forbeare to let bloud, vnlesse\r\nvpon violent extreamitie, & that the signes be excéeding good for the\r\nsame, you shall drinke white wine in the morning fasting, & rub your\r\nhead with a course Towell very hard, but yet cleane, for it is a most\r\nwholesom friction.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February, you shall not let bloud for wantonnesse, but\r\nnéede: you shall forbeare Hearbe-pottage, for at that time onely they\r\nare least wholesome: you shall kéepe the soles of your féete from wet,\r\nand vse euery morning your former friction.\r\n\r\nIn the moneth of March, the signe being good, you may let bloud\r\naccording to your youth, strength, and necessitie: you may take hot and\r\nswéet meats and drinkes, especially Almonds, Figs & Reyzins, & vse also\r\nyour former friction.\r\n\r\nIn the month of Aprill, you may bléed as in the month of March: in it\r\nalso you may purge, by the order of a learned directer: let your dyet\r\nbe hot and fresh meats, and your drinke temperate: also in this moneth\r\nyour former friction is excéeding wholesome.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May be no sluggard, for the bed is vnwholesome,\r\ncléerified Way is this moneth a most soueraigne drinke, and Sage\r\nwith swéet Butter is a most excellent breakefast: yong Lettuce is an\r\napproued good Sallet, and the inthrals or offall of Beasts would by all\r\nmeanes be refused, it is also good to let bloud in this month onely for\r\nnecessitie, and not for pleasure, and beware by all means, not to go\r\nwetshooed in the dew of the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the month of Iune obserue the dyet of May, or if you be of youthfull\r\nbloud it is not amisse if it be a little cooler, and for bléeding let\r\nit be for vrgent necessitie.\r\n\r\nIn the month of Iuly eschew all wanton bed-sport: and if each morning\r\nyou take of draught of clarified Butter-Milke it is very wholesome: vse\r\ncoole Iulyps, and meats that are fresh, and not stirring: now forbeare\r\nLettice, and bléede not, except it be in cause of great extreamitie.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August forbeare all manner of Worts, and Cabadges, and\r\ngenerally all meats and Spices which are hot and inflaming: but by\r\nany meanes bléed not at all, except by the direction of most approued\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September you may eate any sort of ripe Fruits: you\r\nmay bathe in hot bathes, for colde causes, at your pleasure, and you\r\nmay let bloud according to your necessitie: those foods are best which\r\nare of lightest disgestion, and those drinkes most wholesome which are\r\nrather strong then scouring.\r\n\r\nIn the moneth of October, spare not any bloud, except great extreamitie\r\ncompell you, and for your dyet, let it be of such foods as are most\r\nstrong and nourishing, and your drinke Béere or Ale, of indifferent\r\nstrength, and now and then at the midst, and end of meales, a\r\ndraught or two of such Wines as are pleasant, strong, and wholesome:\r\nSallets of Flowers, preserued in Vinegar & Sugar, as either Violets,\r\nBroome-flowers, or Gelly-flowers of all kindes, or Sampyre, Purslan, or\r\nBeane-rods, preserued in pickell, are of excellent vse, both in this\r\nmoneth, and the other two which follow.\r\n\r\nIn the Moneth of Nouember open also no vaine, but for great néed,\r\nbecause the blood is then gathered together into the principall\r\nvessels: Bathing in this Moneth is vtterly to be refused, onely let\r\nyour body be kept warme, and euery colde humour or obstruction, rather\r\ndissolued by moderate frictions, as is shewed in the moneth of Ianuary\r\nand February, then by the violence of any other inward medicine.\r\nShell-Fish in this moneth is very wholesome, and so are all other sorts\r\nof Fish, which are not too rawe or slymie.\r\n\r\nIn the Moneth of December blood-letting should be also forborne, except\r\nvpon some especiall dayes, as after the fiue and twentieth day at the\r\nsoonest: and for your diet let it be meate which is hot and nourishing,\r\nbut by no meanes that which bréedeth melancholie bloud. Vse strong\r\nWine and sharpe Sauces: as for the warmth of your body, next vnto good\r\ncloathing, let it euer procéed from exercise that is moderate, then\r\nfrom toasting, or broiling your selfe against the fire, for in this\r\nMonth that body can hardly be sound whose shinnes are made pyde and\r\nmotley with the fiers scortching.\r\n\r\nAnd thus much touching the experience of the English Husbandman in\r\nthese fore-knowledges, and ayming after the times to come, being\r\ndrawne from the obseruations and rules left vs by succession of times\r\nof those learned Fathers, and other best knowne and approued in\r\nthese knowledges: yet I doe not binde euery Husbandman to make as it\r\nwere new Créeds of these Principles, but onely to giue them to his\r\nmemory, as things that will neither oppresse nor hurt it, and if in\r\nany seldome-séene particularitie, any shall vary from the purpose of\r\nthe relation, to remember that there is aboue vs a God of all Truth\r\nand Knowledge, who will dispose and gouerne all things, according to\r\nhis good Will and Pleasure: to which let euery Creature submit, in\r\nas much as hee onely knoweth what is for mankinde most best and most\r\nconuenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nThe choyce of ground for the Kitchin-garden, and the ordering thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Promise honest and profitable, being seriously made, I holde a sinne\r\ncapitall to neglect, especially where the goodnesse stretcheth it\r\nselfe ouer a whole Kingdome: and hence I haue assumed to perfect both\r\nmy promise and my labour in building vp that weake foundation which\r\nI formerly laid, of the English Husbandman: wherein, contrary to all\r\nother Authors, I am neither beholden to _Pliny, Virgil, Columella,\r\nVaro, Rutillius, Libault_, nor any other Forrainer, but onely to our\r\nowne best experienst Countreymen, whose daily knowledge hath made\r\nthem most perfect in their professions: and what better instruction\r\ncan be had then that which we receiue from the professors, being men\r\nof our owne neighbourhood, acquainted with our Climate and Soile, and\r\nthe necessary things agréeing with the bettering of the same: and not\r\nresort, as our Translators haue done, to strangers helpe, who tels you\r\nthat you must meanure your ground with Asses dung, when our Kingdome\r\nhath not so many foure-footed Asses as wil meanure one Acre, and many\r\nsuch like things which our Kingdome affordeth not: therefore according\r\nto the plaine true English fashion, thus I pursue my purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The choyce of Ground.]\r\n\r\nTouching the choyse of Ground, I haue in the former part of this Booke\r\nshewed you the true nature and goodnesse of euery seuerall Soyle: and\r\nyou are to vnderstand that the best Soyle is best for this purpose,\r\nbecause it is least laborsome, and most profitable: yet notwithstanding\r\nthat some of our translated Authors doth vtterly disalow for Gardens\r\nmany Soyles, as namely, all Sands, all Chawkie earths, all Grauell, all\r\nEarths like dust, and any Earth which chappeth or openeth in the heat\r\nof Summer, by that meanes depriuing almost halfe our kingdome of the\r\nbenefit of Gardens, yet I assure you there is no Soyle whatsoeuer (if\r\nit lye from the inundation of water, or be not absolutely boggy) but\r\nwith industry will beare any Fruit, Hearbe, or Flower, plentifully, and\r\nwithout any casualtie procéeding from the barraines therof: witnes a\r\nmost worthy Garden in the barren Peake of _Darbyshire_, where there is\r\nno curious Trée or Plant wanting, nor doe they flourish in any place\r\nmore brauely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bettering of Grounds.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The trenching of Grounds.]\r\n\r\nNow for mine owne part, I write generally to all Husbandmen, not to\r\nthose onely which liue in fertile and fat Soyles, and therefore I would\r\nhaue no man say, the Soyle where I liue is so barraine, that I cannot\r\nhaue a Garden: for if the Soyle wherein you liue, be barraine, then\r\nshall you in the latter end of September breake vp your earth more then\r\na Spade-graft déepe, and be well assured that at euery Spade-graft you\r\nbreake the mould well, and leaue not the rootes of any wéeds within it,\r\nthen let it rest till the midst of October, at which time if any wéeds\r\nappeare vpon it, by all meanes let them be pluckt vp by the roots,\r\nwhich done, you shall trench your ground at least a yarde and a halfe\r\ndéepe, and then bury in those trenches, if it be a Sand or grauell\r\nearth, great store of Oxe or Cow meanure, if it be a colde Chalkie\r\nClay, or a moyst ground, then great store of Horse meanure, of both\r\nwhich meanures the oldest and rottenest is the best: but if you liue in\r\nsuch a Soyle as there is neyther of these meanures bred therein, then\r\ntake straw of any kinde whatsoeuer, and spread it in the high-way where\r\nthere is much trauell, & when it is rotten with the beating of Horse\r\nféet, then cause it to be shoueld vp, & with it fill your trenches,\r\nbut if Straw be wanting, then if you haue any muddy ditches or ponds,\r\nscowre the mud out of them, & with it fill vp your trenches: & although\r\nthese are not so long lasting as the two first sorts of meanures,\r\nyet they are sufficient to bring forth increase, & must supply where\r\nnecessity inforceth, alwayes hauing discretion when you sée your\r\nground abate in fruitfulnes, to replenish it with fresh meanure.\r\n\r\nNow as you fill your trenches with meanure, let one mixe the earth\r\ntherewithall, and as it were blend and incorporate them together: thus\r\nhauing gone ouer so much ground as you intend to plant or sowe vpon,\r\nyou shall let it rest till the midst of Ianuary, at which time you\r\nshall breake it vp in trenches againe, but not aboue thrée quarters\r\nof a yarde déepe, and then fill vp those trenches with meanure as\r\nbefore, and lay your earth as leuell as is possible, & so let it rest\r\ntill the beginning of March (if the weather be seasonable for sowing\r\nor planting) otherwise let it stay till mid-March, and as soone as the\r\nMoone is changed you shall then dig it vp the fourth time, and make it\r\nfit to receyue your séede, but in this fourth time of turning ouer your\r\nearth, you shall dig it but a little better then a Spade-graft depth,\r\nand euer as you dig it, mixe it with fresh meanure: if your ground be\r\nsubiect to much chapping or rining, then you shall at this last digging\r\nmixe the earth with ashes and Horse meanure mixt together, which will\r\nbinde and holde the earth from chapping.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of breaking the Garden moulde.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ordering of Garden-beds.]\r\n\r\nAfter you haue digd your ground in this order, and made it leuell,\r\nyou shal with an Iron Rake breake the great clods of earth, and bring\r\nit to as fine a mould as is possible, euer obseruing that if in the\r\nbreaking of the clods or otherwise, you perceiue the roots or stalks of\r\nany wéeds to arise, you shall presently with your hand pull them out,\r\nand cast them on heaps, that they may serue eyther for the fire or the\r\ndunghill: which done, you shall tread out your beds in such orderly\r\nsort, that you may passe from one to the other without eyther treading\r\nvpon the beds, or striding ouer them: & thus much for the barraine &\r\nsterrill ground, which although all ancient & late writers reiect, as\r\nnot worthy to be imployed to this vse, yet beléeue it, being husbanded\r\nas is said before, it will equall in fruitfulnes the best ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the fruitfull Soyle.]\r\n\r\nTouching your rich and perfect grounds, which of themselues are apt\r\nto put forth with little labour, you shall onely at the latter end\r\nof September breake vp the Earth, and making greater Trenches, fill\r\nthem well with Oxe meanure, and then turning the Earth vpon the\r\nmeanure, leuell your ground very carefully, breake the clots and\r\nrake it very painefully, and then treade out your beds, as is before\r\nsayd, artificially; but if the ground which you breake vp, be eyther\r\ngréene-swarth, or much ouergrowne with wéeds (as these rich soyles\r\nmust euer be the one or the other) (for they will not be idle, but\r\ncontinually bringing forth) then at this first digging and dunging you\r\nshall haue diuers which shall follow the Spade, who shall take away\r\nall manner of roots, gréenes, grasse-tufts, stones, or whatsoeuer may\r\nbréede anoyance to the ground: which worke being perfected, you shall\r\nlet the ground rest all winter till the beginning of March, that the\r\nfrost may mellow and ripen the mould, and also kill the roots of such\r\nwéeds as the Spade hath turned vp, and haue béene omitted to be pulled\r\naway.\r\n\r\nNow so soone as March is come, vpon the first change of the Moone, you\r\nshall digge vp this Earth againe, leuell it, and order it in all points\r\nas was sayd of the barraine Earth, onely there will néede no more vse\r\nof meanure, but as soone as it is digged, raked, leuelled, and brought\r\ninto a fine mould, you may then tread out your Beds, as aforesayd, euer\r\nproportioning the quantitie of them according to the quantitie of your\r\nséedes, hauing the most of that which is most in vse, and the least of\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nNow as touching the fencing and inclosing of your Garden, I haue in\r\nthe former Booke shewed you the same at large, and giuen seuerall\r\ninstructions, according to mens seuerall abilities, with this caution,\r\nthat whether your fence be wall, pale, dead-hedge, ditch, or quickset,\r\nyet it must be so high that it may with assurance kéepe all manner of\r\nPullen from flying ouer the same, who are the greatest enemies to a\r\nGarden that may be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The necessariest Ornament in a Garden.]\r\n\r\nThere would be also in this Kitchin-Garden, if with conueniency it may\r\nbe brought to passe, eyther a Pumpe, Well, or Cesterne, which might\r\nflow continually with water all the Summer time, for the watering of\r\nHearbs, as shall be héereafter declared. And thus much touching the\r\nchoyce of ground for a Kitchin-garden, and the ordering of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of the sowing and ordering of all manner of Pot-hearbs._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you haue prepared your ground, and cast your beds in an orderly\r\nfashion, as is before spoken, you shall then take your Séeds which\r\nSéeds would by no meanes be aboue a yéere olde: and hauing sorted them\r\nseuerally, euery one by it selfe, and appointed the beds which shall\r\nseuerally receiue them: you shall in this manner sowe your Pot-hearbs,\r\nwhich craue not much roote, because their onely benefit is in the\r\nleafe: take your séeds and put them into a wooden Tray, then take your\r\nGarden moulde, the finest that may be, being made almost as fine as\r\nashes, and mixe your Séeds, and that mould very well together, then goe\r\nto the bedde where you meane to bestow them, and hauing newly rackt\r\nit (to stirre vp the fresh mould) with your hand sprinkle and sowe\r\nthem all ouer the bed, so thicke as may be: which done, with a fine\r\nRake, rake the bed gently ouer, then taking spare fine mould, put it\r\ninto a ridling Siue, and sift it ouer the bed better then two fingers\r\nthickenesse, and so let it rest: thus you shall doe seuerally with\r\neuery séede one after another, bestowing euery one vpon a seuerall bed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of all sorts of Pot-hearbs.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of _Endiue_ and _Succorie_.]\r\n\r\nNow for your Pot-hearbs, which are most generally in vse, they be\r\nthese: _Endiue_ and _Succorie_, which delight in moyst ground, and\r\nwill endure the winter. _Bleete_ of which there be two kindes, Red and\r\nWhite: this Hearbe neuer néedeth wéeding, and if he be suffered to shed\r\nhis séed it will hardly euer to be got out of a Garden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Beets.]\r\n\r\nThen _Beets_, which must be much wéeded, for they loue to liue by\r\nthemselues, and if they grow too thicke you may take them vp when they\r\nare a finger long in their owne earth, and set them in another bed, and\r\nthey will prosper much better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land-Cresses.]\r\n\r\nThen land _Cresses_, which is both a good Pot-hearbe and a good\r\nSallet-Hearbe: it loueth shadowie places, where the Sunne shineth\r\nleast, and standeth in néed of little dung.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parcely.]\r\n\r\nThen _Parcely_, which of all Hearbs is of most vse, it is longest in\r\nappearing aboue ground, and the elder séed is the quicker in growth,\r\nbut not the surer; but eyther being once come vp increase naturally,\r\nand doe hardly euer decay: it cannot grow too thicke, but as you vse it\r\nyou must cut off the toppes with your knife, and by no meanes pull vp\r\nthe rootes: if it be put into a little pursse, and beaten against the\r\nground, to bruise it a little before it be sowne, it will make it haue\r\na large crisped leafe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Sauory.]\r\n\r\nThen _Sauory_, of which are two kindes, the Winter-_Sauory_, and\r\nSummer, both delight in leane ground, and are quicke of growth, and\r\nlong lasting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Time.]\r\n\r\nThen _Time_, of which are also two kindes, the running _Time_, and the\r\nGarden _Time_: they delight in fertile ground, and from the séede are\r\nvery slow of growth, therefore it is best euer to set them from the\r\nslip. The running _Time_ doth delight in the shadow, but the Garden\r\n_Time_ in the Sunne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Mallowes.]\r\n\r\nThen French-_Mallowes_, which will ioy in any ground, and are quicke of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cheruill.]\r\n\r\nThen _Cheruill_, which will not by any meanes grow with any other\r\nHearbe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Dill.]\r\n\r\nThen _Dill_, which may be sowne almost in any moneth of the yéere as\r\nwell as March: it endureth all weathers, but loueth the warmth best.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Isop.]\r\n\r\nThen _Isop_, which in like manner as _Time_ is, slow of growth from\r\nthe séed, and therefore fitter to be set from the slips, after it\r\nhath once taken roote it encreaseth wonderfully, and will hardly be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Mints.]\r\n\r\nThen _Mints_, which flourish onely in the Summer time, but dye in the\r\nWinter, it delighteth most in the moyst ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Violets.]\r\n\r\nThen _Violets_, the leaues whereof are a good Pot-hearb, and the\r\nFlowers preserued in close glasse pots, with strong Wine-vinegar and\r\nSugar, a most excellent Sallet: it doth delight to grow high, and will\r\ngrow spéedely eyther from the plant or from the séed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Basill.]\r\n\r\nThen _Basill_, which would be sowne in the warme weather, as at the\r\nbeginning of May, for the séed is tender, and when you haue sowne it,\r\nyou shall presse the earth downe vpon it with your féet, for the séede\r\ncan endure no hollownesse: if you sowe it at the fall of the Leafe, you\r\nshall sprinkle the séede with Vinegar, and when you water it let the\r\nSunne be at his height.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sweet Marioram.]\r\n\r\nThen swéet _Marioram_, which would be sowne on rich ground, and farre\r\nfrom Sunneshine, for it taketh no delight in his beames.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marigolds.]\r\n\r\nThen _Marigolds_, which renew euery moneth, and endure the Winter as\r\nwell as the Summer: this Hearbe the oftner you remoue it, the bigger it\r\ngroweth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Strawberries.]\r\n\r\nThen _Strawberries_, whose leaues are a good Pot-hearbe, and the fruit\r\nthe wholesommest berry: this Hearbe of all other, would be set of the\r\nplant, and not sowne from the séed, for the oft changing and remouing\r\nof it causeth it to grow bigger and bigger: it groweth best vnder the\r\nshadowes of other Hearbes, but very sufficiently in beds, or else where.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Borage and Buglosse.]\r\n\r\nThen _Borage_ and _Buglosse_, both which are of one nature: they would\r\nbe sowne in small quantity, for where they take they will runne ouer\r\na whole Garden: the séed must be gathered when it is halfe ripe it is\r\nso apt to shed, and when you gather it you must plucke vp the stalkes,\r\nleaues & all, and so laying them one vpon another thrée or foure dayes,\r\ntheir own heat will bring the séed to ripenes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Rosemary.]\r\n\r\nThen _Rosemary_, which is an Hearbe tender and curious, yet of\r\nsingular vertue: it is soone slaine with frost or lightening: it\r\nwill grow plentifully from the séede, but much better from the slip,\r\nit delighteth to be planted against some Wall where it may haue the\r\nreflection of the Sunne, for to stand vnpropped of himselfe, the very\r\nshaking of the winde will kill it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Penyroyal.]\r\n\r\nThen _Penyroyall_, which most properly is vsed to be mixt with\r\nPuddings, made of the bloud of Beasts, & Oatmeale: of it there be two\r\nkindes, Male and Female: the Male beareth a white flower, and the\r\nFemale a purple: it must be sowne in small quantity, for it will runne\r\nand spread ouer-much ground: it delighteth most in moyst earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Leekes.]\r\n\r\nThen _Leekes_, which would haue a fertile ground, and as soone as they\r\nbe shot vp a good length you shall cut the blades to the polt, and then\r\nremoue the heads, and set them borderwise about your other beds: this\r\nremouing after the cutting off the blades, wil make them grow bigger,\r\nand prosper better, as for thrusting Oyster-shels or Tyle-shreads vnder\r\nthem, to make the heads bigger, it is a toy, for if the mould be loose\r\nand good, the Léeke will come to his perfect growth: they may be sowne\r\nboth in March, Aprill, May, and Iune, and they may be remoued all Iuly,\r\nAugust, September and October.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Onions.]\r\n\r\nThen _Onions_, which differ not much from the nature of Léekes, they\r\nloue a fertile Soyle, and would be sowne with the séeds of Sauory: when\r\nthey come vp if they grow too thicke, as is often séene, you shall\r\nplucke vp some and spend them in the Pot and in Sallets, to giue the\r\nrest more roome, and some you shall take vp and replant in other beds,\r\nwhich you may preserue for séede: those _Onions_ which you would not\r\nhaue to séede, you shall cut off the blades in the midst, that the\r\niuyce may descend downeward, and when you sée the heads of the _Onions_\r\nappearing aboue the earth, you shall with your féet tread them into the\r\nground: there be some very well experienst Husbands, which will take\r\nthe fayrest, goodliest and soundest Onions they can get, and in this\r\nmoneth of March set them thrée fingers déepe in the earth, and these\r\nof all other bring forth the purest and best séede, for which purpose\r\nonely they are preserued: as soone as your séed-Onions are knotted, you\r\nshall vnderproppe them with square cradles, made of stickes, least the\r\nwaight of the boules which carry the séede, should breake the blades.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of gathering Onion-seede, or the Onion.]\r\n\r\nThe time of gathering your séede is, when it is all turned purely\r\nblacke, and the time of gathering the Onions is, when the heads doe\r\nforsake the earth, after they be gathered you shall lay them on a dry\r\nfloore for a fortnight, or more, and then binde them vp in ropes, and\r\nhang them where they may haue the ayre of the fire, onely note that\r\nshall gather your Onions in the increase of the Moone, as they were\r\nsowne, and not otherwise.\r\n\r\nMany other Pot-hearbs there be, which for as much as they differ\r\nnothing, eyther in sowing, planting, or ordering, from these which I\r\nhaue rehearsed, I will héere omit them, and thinke this sufficient,\r\ntouching the sowing and ordering of all manner of Pot-hearbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the sowing of certaine Hearbs, which are to be eaten, but\r\nespecially are medicinall, yet euer in the Husbandmans Garden._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Arage.]\r\n\r\nOf Hearbes which are medicinall, I will begin with _Arage_ or _Orache_,\r\nwhich being colde and moyst is very excellent against the hot Gout: it\r\nis to be sowne in any moneth, from February till December: it loueth\r\nmuch moisture, and therefore must be oft watered: it must be sowne\r\nexcéeding thinne, and quickly couered, for the ayre is offensiue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Lumbardy Loueage.]\r\n\r\nNext it is _Lumbardy_, _Loueage_, which being hot and dry, is very\r\npurgatiue, it desireth a very fruitfull ground, but if it be sowne\r\nwhere it may haue much shadow and some shelter accompanied with\r\nmoysture, it will grow in any ground, the moneths for sowing thereof,\r\nis, from the midst of February till Haruest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Fennell.]\r\n\r\n_Fennell_ is also hot and dry, and it comforteth the stomacke, openeth\r\nthe inward vessels, and helpeth disgestion; it may be sowne in any\r\nmoneth, and vpon any indifferent ground, especially if it be a little\r\nstony, the séede would not be very old, though of all other it be the\r\nlongest laster.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Anise.]\r\n\r\n_Anise_ is hot and dry, it dissolueth humors and obstructions, and is\r\nvery comfortable to weake stomacks, it delighteth in a good and loose\r\nmould, and is to be sowne in the height of the Spring onely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Comin.]\r\n\r\n_Comin_ is of the nature of _Anise_ and _Fennell_, and mixt with\r\neither, is very soueraine against all inward sicknesses procéeding from\r\ncold, it loueth a fruitfull rich earth & much warmth, and therfore the\r\nlater it is sowne in the Spring, it is so much the better, and aboue\r\nall things it would be sowne in the hottest time of the day, & if it\r\nbe mixed with other séeds, it is so much the better, and appeareth the\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Coliander.]\r\n\r\n_Coliander_ is of the nature of the earth, cold & dry, it helps\r\ndisgestion, & suppresseth vapours which offend the braine, it may be\r\nsowne vpon any indifferent ground, & in any month except December and\r\nIanuary, the elder the séedes are the better so they be sound, and they\r\ndesire much watering.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Rue.]\r\n\r\n_Rue_ or _Hearb-grace_ is hot and dry, & is very soueraigne against all\r\ninward infection, putrifactions, and impostumations, it ioyeth in any\r\nreasonable ground so it grow warme and dry, the moneths fittest for the\r\nsowing thereof, is March, Aprill or May, and the mould would be firme\r\nand not subiect to ryuing, whence it procéedes that no meanure is so\r\ngood for the encrease thereof as horse-dung and ashes mixt together:\r\nthe beds would be made high & discending, that no moysture may stay\r\nthereon, they must be carefully wéeded, for in their first growth\r\notherwise they are soone choaked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Organie.]\r\n\r\n_Organie_ is hot and dry, and excellent against any sicknesse of the\r\nliuer, the ground in which it most ioyeth would be a little stonie, and\r\nfull of rubbish, yet by no meanes vndunged, the moneth fittest for the\r\nsowing thereof is March and September, the Moone being in _Libra_ or\r\nany other moist signe, it must be continually watred till it appears\r\naboue the earth, but after forborne, for being once well bred, it is\r\neuer certaine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of white Poppy.]\r\n\r\nWhite _Poppy_ is cold and moyst, and much prouoketh sléepe: it delights\r\nto be sowne in a rich, warme, dry ground, in the moneths of March,\r\nSeptember or Nouember.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Germander.]\r\n\r\n_Germander_ is hot and dry, and excellent against the Kings euill;\r\nobstructions of the Spléene and hardnesse of Vrine; it is a hard\r\nhearbe, and will prosper in any ground, it is to be sowne, either in\r\nthe spring or fall of the leafe, and is most comly for the setting\r\nforth of knots in Gardens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Cardus Benedictus.]\r\n\r\n_Cardus Benedictus_, or the blessed Thistell, is hot and dry, it is\r\nvery soueraine against most inward sicknesses, stancheth blood, and is\r\na great comforter of the braine, it delighteth in a rich ground and\r\na loose well tempered mould, it must be sowne very shallow, and not\r\ncouered aboue two inches déepe, the first quarter of the Moone is best\r\nto sowe it in, and in the moneths of March, May or September, if you\r\nsowe a little fine flaxen Wheat with it, no doubt but it will prosper\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Angellica.]\r\n\r\n_Angellica_ is hot and dry, it openeth and dissolueth obstructions, is\r\nan excellent cordiall against poyson, and all infections, it helpeth\r\nthe collicke, and cureth the biting of madde dogges or venemous beasts,\r\nit loueth a fruitfull dry mould, but may not indure the trouble of\r\nwéedes, it is to be sowne in March or Aprill, & it flourisheth in Iuly\r\n& August, it hath a swéet odour, and helpeth all euill & infected ayres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Valerian.]\r\n\r\n_Valerian_ is hot & dry and preuenteth infection, it helpeth stitches\r\nand other griefes procéeding from windy causes, it loueth to grow in\r\nmoist and low places, the ground being well meanured, and till it\r\nbe shot at least a handfull high, it must be kept with continuall\r\nwatring, the moystest time of the yéere is the best to sowe it in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Elecampana.]\r\n\r\n_Elecampana_, is hot and moyst, and good for offences in the lungs, or\r\nany outward ioynt, being troubled with paine procéeding from colde: it\r\nis better much to be set then sowne, yet notwithstanding it may safely\r\nenough be sowne at any time after mid-March, the ground being rich,\r\nsoft, and loose, and the séede strowed very thinne, and at least two\r\nfingers distance one from another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Pepperwort.]\r\n\r\n_Pepperwort_ is hot and drye, yet of the two much more hot, it is good\r\nagainst all kinde of aches, and other paine in the ioynts, or sinewes:\r\nit delighteth in a rich blacke Soyle, fat and loose: it would be sowne\r\nin February, and remoued in September.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Philipendula.]\r\n\r\n_Philipendula_ is very hot and dry, and is good against abortiue\r\nbirths, Stone, Strangury, or any griefe procéeding from colde causes:\r\nit may be sowne in any barraine, stony, or grauelly Soyle, in the\r\nmonths of May, Aprill, or September: it neither desireth much wéeding,\r\nnor much watering, but being once committed to the ground appeareth\r\nsodainely: and thus much of those Hearbes which are fit for Medicine,\r\nof which though there be many others, yet they differ not in their\r\nordering from these already declared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of diuers sorts of Sallet-Hearbes, their manner of sowing and\r\nordering._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Lettuce.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the many numbers of Sallet-Hearbes I thinke it not amisse\r\nto beginne first with _Lettuce_, which of all other whose vertue is\r\nhelde in the leafe, is most delicate, tender, and pleasant: the ground\r\nthen in which it most delighteth, is that which is most fertile,\r\nbest laboured, and of the finest mould, being soft, loose, and more\r\nenclining to moysture then drinesse: it may be sowne in any moneth of\r\nthe yeare, from February to Nouember; it is very quick of growth, and\r\nwill appeare aboue the earth in foure dayes after the sowing: it would\r\nat first be sowne thicke, and carefully kept with morning and euening\r\nwatrings, if the season be dry, but not otherwise: after it is growne\r\nand faire spread aboue the earth, which will be in a moneths space or\r\nthere-abouts, you shall chuse out the fairest and goodliest plants,\r\nand taking them vp with the earth and all, about their rootes, replant\r\nor remoue them to a new bed of fresh mould, and there set them a foote\r\ndistance one from another, and fixe their rootes fast and hard into the\r\nground: then couer or presse them downe with Tyle or Slate stones, to\r\nmake them spread and not spring vpward, by which meanes the leaues will\r\ngather together, and cabbadge, in a thicke and good order, for it is to\r\nbe vnderstood, that the oftner you remoue your _Lettuce_, the fairer\r\nand closer they wil cabbage. There be diuers which obserue to remoue\r\n_Lettuce_ as soone as sixe leaues are sprung aboue the ground; but I\r\nlike better to remoue them when they begin to spindle: they are most\r\nestéemed in the moneths of Aprill, May, and Iune, for in Iuly they are\r\nsupposed to carrie in them a poysonous substance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Spynage.]\r\n\r\nNext the _Lettuce_ I preferre the hearbe _Spynage_, which delighteth in\r\na well-dunged earth, and may be sowne in Aprill, March, September, or\r\nOctober: it would not be mixed with other séedes, because it prospereth\r\nbest alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Sparagus.]\r\n\r\n_Sparagus_ ioyeth in a fertill moist ground, the mould being made light\r\nwhich couers it, and the ground well dunged, the Spring is the best\r\ntime to sowe it, and it must be sowne in long furrowes or trenches made\r\nwith your finger, and not vniuersally spread ouer the bed as other\r\nséeds are: it loueth moysture, but may not endure the wet to lye long\r\nvpon it, and therefore the beds would a little descend it: must not be\r\nremoued till the rootes be so feltred together, that they hinder the\r\nnew branches from springing vp, which commonly is two yeares.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Colworts.]\r\n\r\n_Colworts_ or _Cabbadge_ séede delighteth in any well husbanded ground,\r\nand may be sowen in all sorts and seasons as _Lettuce_ is, and must\r\nalso in the like manner be remoued, after the principall leaues are\r\ncome forth, which will make them to gather together, and cabbadge\r\nthe better: and as they may be sowen in any season of the yeare, so\r\nlikewise they may be remoued at all seasons likewise, except the frost\r\nor other vnseasonable weather hinder you: and although some men will\r\nnot allow it to be sowen in clay grounds, grauell, chalke, or sand,\r\nyet they are deceiued; for if the earth be well ordred, they will grow\r\nplentifully, onely you must obserue when you remoue them to let them\r\nhaue earth roome enough.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Sage.]\r\n\r\n_Sage_ is in Gardens most common, because it is most wholesome, and\r\nthough it may be better set from the slip then sowen in the séede,\r\nyet both will prosper, it loueth any well drest ground, and may be\r\nsowen either in February, March, September, or October: it loueth also\r\nto grow thick and close together, and will of it selfe ouercome most\r\nwéedes: it asketh not much dung, neither too great care in watring,\r\nonely it would be oft searched, for Toades and other venemous things\r\nwill delight to lye vnder it, the more Sunne and ayre it hath, the\r\nbetter it is.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Purslane.]\r\n\r\n_Purslane_ is a most excellent Sallet-hearbe, and loueth a fertile\r\nsoile, and though it may be sowen almost in any moneth, yet the warmest\r\nis the best, as Aprill, May, Iune, or Septemb. Buck ashes are an\r\nexcellent meanure for them, and for most Sallet-hearbs else, but aboue\r\nall they loue dry dust and house-swéepings, they are apt to shed their\r\nséede, whence it comes that a ground once possest of them will seldome\r\nwant them, they may also be remoued, and will prosper much the better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Artichokes.]\r\n\r\n_Artychokes_ loue a fat earth, and may be sowen in February or March,\r\nthe Moone encreasing, the séedes must not be sowen together, but set\r\none by one a good distance asunder; they must lye somewhat déepe, and\r\nbe firmely couered; yet if you can procure them, I rather wish you\r\nrather to set them from Slips or young Plants, then sowe them from the\r\nséedes, for they doe so naturally loue the earth, that you can hardly\r\nslip so wast a leafe from an _Artychoke_ as will not take roote; if you\r\nsowe the séede, you must be carefull to wéede and water them well, for\r\nthe first leaues are very tender: also if you remoue them after their\r\nfirst springing, the fruit will be bigger and better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Garlicke.]\r\n\r\n_Garlicke_ is best in September and Nouember, to be set from the cloue,\r\nin & about the borders of beds, or other séedes, halfe a foote one\r\nfrom another, and in February, March, and Aprill, to be sowen from the\r\nséede: it must be ordered as you order _Onyon_ séede, it loues not much\r\nwet nor extreame drought, onely it desires a good mould which is rich\r\nand firme, yet not too much dunged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Raddish.]\r\n\r\n_Raddish_ loueth a fertile ground, that is well dunged, chiefly with\r\nmans ordure, that is déepe trencht, and hath an easie and light mould,\r\nand the séedes would be placed either in rowes, or about the borders of\r\nbeds, as you doe _Garlicke_: the manner of sowing it is with a dibble\r\nor round sticke, to make a hole into the ground almost a foote déepe,\r\nand then into that hole to put not aboue two séedes at the most, and\r\nthen close the hole vp againe, and let the holes be foure fingers one\r\nfrom another, it may be sowen in most months of the yéere if the frost\r\nhinder not, and to make the roote large & tender, and to kéepe the\r\nbranch from séeding; you shall as it springs crop off the principall\r\nleaues which grow against the heart of the root: to tread them downe\r\ninto the earth after they haue fast roote is good also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Nauew.]\r\n\r\n_Nauew_, if the earth haue any small goodnesse in it will grow\r\nplentifully, neither is offended with any ayre, onely the mould would\r\nbe loose and rough, for otherwise it many times turneth to Rape: the\r\nséede naturally commeth vp very thicke, therefore it is expedient to\r\nremoue them and plant them thinner, for that best preserueth their\r\nnatures, they may be sowne in February, March, Aprill, September, or\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Parsneps and Carrets.]\r\n\r\n_Parsneps_ or _Carrets_ are of one and the selfe nature, they delight\r\nin a good fat earth, and would be sowne reasonably thicke, in long\r\ndéepe trenches like furrowes, hauing a gentle and easie mould either in\r\nthe moneth of Ianuary, February, or March, or in September, October, or\r\nDecember, they must be carefully well wéeded, and if the earth be fat,\r\nthey néede not much watring or other attendance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Pompyons.]\r\n\r\n_Pompyons_, _Gourds_, or _Mellons_, desire a very good ground, or by\r\nNature or Art, the séedes must be sowne very thinne, as at least halfe\r\na foote one from another, they would lye reasonably déepe, yet the\r\nmould very gentle which couers them, they are subiect to spread and\r\nrunne ouer much ground, therefore as they grow you must direct their\r\nstemmes so as they may not annoy one another, and when they flower you\r\nshall lay broad Tiles or Slate stones vnder them, that the fruit nor\r\nflower may not touch the earth; if you plash them vp against trées\r\nor walles where they may haue the reflection of the Sunne, the fruit\r\nwill be larger, pleasanter, and sooner ripe: they néede no wéeding\r\nnor watring after you sée them appeare aboue the earth, and the best\r\nseasons to sowe them in, is February, March, or Aprill, those are the\r\nbest _Pompyons_ which haue the smallest séedes, and are of the most\r\nyellowest complexion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Cowcumber.]\r\n\r\n_Cowcumber_, is a delicate, pleasant, yet very tender fruit, and\r\ndelighteth in an extraordinarie fat earth, especially during the\r\nopening or sprouting of the séede, therefore the best and most\r\nvndoubted safest way for sowing them is, first in some corner of your\r\nKitchin garden to make a bed of two or thrée yards square of olde Oxe\r\ndung, and Horse dung mixt together, and at least a yard or better high\r\nfrom the earth, then couer this bed of dung with the richest garden\r\nmould you haue, better then halfe a foote thicke: then thereon place\r\nyour séedes halfe a foote likewise one from another, and be most\r\nsure that your séedes be hard and sound (for any softnesse in them\r\nsheweth rottennesse) then couer them foure fingers thicke with the\r\nlike mould: then within seauen or eight dayes, after you shall sée\r\nthem appeare aboue the earth, but in any wise let them continue still\r\ntill the principall leaues be come forth, and they begin to créepe out\r\nin length, then with your hand griping the whole plant, take it vp by\r\nthe rootes with the earth and all, and plant it in a bed new digged &\r\ntrimmed for the purpose with a rich loose mould, and so replant and\r\nremoue each roote seuerally one after another, and they will grow and\r\nbring forth in great plenty. Now by the way you must obserue, that as\r\nsoone as you haue sowne your séedes you shall prouide a Mat, Canuasse,\r\nor other couering, which being placed vpon stakes ouer the dung bed,\r\nshall euery night after Sunne-set be spread ouer the same, and not\r\ntaken away till the Sunne be risen in the morning, for this will defend\r\nthe séedes from frosts and other cold dewes which are very dangerous.\r\nNow if any demand why these séedes are thus sowne first on the bed\r\nof dung, they shall vnderstand that besides the warmth and fertility\r\nthereof, that the séedes are so pleasant and tender, that wormes and\r\nother créeping things in the earth will destroy them before they can\r\nsprout, which this bed of dung preuenteth. The months most fit for\r\nsowing these séedes, are Aprill, May and Iune onely, for other are much\r\ntoo colde, and in this manner you may sowe any tender séede whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Beane of Egipt.]\r\n\r\n_Beanes_ of _Egipt_ delight in a moyst watrish ground, rather fertile\r\nthen any way giuen to barrainnesse, yet will plentifully enough prosper\r\nin any indifferent earth: they are rather to set then sowe, because\r\nthey must take strong roote, and be fixed somewhat déepe into the\r\nearth, and the moneth which is most proper for them, is the latter end\r\nof Ianuary, all February and the beginning of March onely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Skerrets.]\r\n\r\n_Skerrets_ are a delicate roote, white, tender, and pleasant, little\r\ndiffering in tast or excellencie from the _Eringo_. They delight in a\r\nrich mould, moyst and well broken, and must be set déepe in the earth:\r\nafter they be a finger length aboue the ground they would be remoued,\r\nand planted in a fresh mould, which will preserue them from spéedie\r\nséeding, for when they runne to séede, they loose the vertue of their\r\nroote. The moneths fittest for the sowing of them is March, Aprill, and\r\nMay, and if you desire to haue them all Winter, you may then sowe them\r\nin September and October. And thus much for Sallet-hearbs, and rootes\r\nof all natures, of which kindes though there be diuers other, yet you\r\nshall vnderstand, all are to be ordered in the manner of these before\r\nrehearsed, that is to say, such as haue their vertues in the stalke\r\nor leaues, like _Spynage_, _Sparagus_, _Purslayn_, and such like,\r\nthose which cabbadge or knit together in hard lumps, like _Lettuce_,\r\n_Colworts_, and such like, and those whose goodnesse liues in their\r\nrootes, like _Raddish_, _Carrets_, _Skerrets_, and such like.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A most necessary obseruation.]\r\n\r\nNow for a most necessarie obseruation, euery Gardner ought to beare\r\nthis rule in his memorie, that all Pot-hearbs must be sowne thicke, and\r\nbut thinly couered, as namely not aboue thrée fingers: all hearbs which\r\ncabbadge must be sowne thicke, and déeper couered, as a full handfull\r\nat least, and in their remouing planted thinne, and well fixt into\r\nthe earth: and all rootes must be sowen thinne and déepe, as almost a\r\nfoote either let into the ground, or strewed in déepe furrowes, digged\r\nand laide vp for the purpose, in which the quantity of your séede must\r\nonely direct you: for if you haue occasion to sow hardly a handfull,\r\nthen you may set them one by one into the ground at your leasure, but\r\nif you haue occasion to sowe many Pecks or halfe Pecks, then you shall\r\nturne vp your earth into déepe furrowes, and in the bottome thereof\r\nscatter your séeds, and after rake it into a leuell, and you shall not\r\nonely saue much labour, but gaine your purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Flowers of all sorts both forraigne and home-bred, their sowing,\r\nplanting, and preseruing._\r\n\r\n\r\nHauing written sufficiently of Pot-hearbs and Sallet-hearbs, which are\r\nthe ornaments of the Husbandmans Kitchin or Table, I will here speake\r\nof flowers, which either for their smels, beauties, or both, are the\r\ngraces of his Chamber. And first, because my maine ayme and scope is\r\nEnglish Husbandrie, I will begin with those flowers which are most\r\nproper and naturall for our climate, of which because I holde _Roses_\r\nboth for their smell, beauties, and wholesomnesse to excéede all other,\r\nI thinke it not amisse to giue them the first place and precedencie\r\nbefore all other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Roses.]\r\n\r\nYou shall vnderstand then that _Roses_ are generally and aunciently\r\nbut of thrée kindes, the Damaske, the red, and the white, and what are\r\ndifferent from these are but deriuations from them, being by grafting,\r\nreplanting, and phisicking, somewhat altered either in colour, smell,\r\nor doublenesse of leafe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Damaske Rose.]\r\n\r\nTo speake then first of the Damaske _Rose_, it is fit that all\r\nhusbandmen know, that _Roses_ may as well be sowne from the séede, as\r\nplanted from the roote, Syen, or branch onely, they are the slower in\r\ncomming vp, more tender to nourish, and much longer in yéelding forth\r\ntheir flowers, yet for satisfaction sake and where necessitie vrgeth,\r\nif of force or pleasure you must sowe it from the séede, you shall\r\nchuse a ruffish earth loose and well dunged, and you shall cast vp\r\nyour beds high and narrow: the moneth which is fit for their sowing\r\nis September, and they must be couered not aboue four fingers déepe,\r\nthey must be defended well all the Winter from frosts and stormes, and\r\nthen they will beare their flowers plentifully all the next Spring\r\nfollowing: yet this is to be noted, that all _Roses_ which rise from\r\nthe séede simply, their flowers will be single like the _Eglantine_,\r\nor _Cyphanie_, therefore after your plants are two yéeres olde, you\r\nmust graft one into another, as you doe other fruit, and that will\r\nmake them double and thicke: also you must remember that those yellow\r\nsmall séedes which are in the midst of the _Rose_, are not true _Rose_\r\nséedes, but those which lye hid in the round peare knob vnder the\r\n_Rose_, which as soone as the leaues are fallen away, will open and\r\nshew the séede. And thus much touching the sowing of all sorts of\r\n_Roses_, which is for experience and knowledge sake onely, for indéede\r\nthe true vse and property of the _Rose_ is to be planted in short slips\r\nabout fourtéene inches long, and the small tassels of the roote cut\r\naway, they would be set halfe a foote into the ground, in the same\r\nmanner as you set ordinary Quick-set, and of like thicknesse, rather a\r\nlittle slope-wise then vpright: and though some thinke March the best\r\nseason, yet doubtlesse September is much better for hauing the roote\r\nconfirmed all the Winter, they will beare the sooner and better all the\r\nSommer following; you must be carefull to plant them in faire weather,\r\nand as néere as you can vnder shelter as by the sides of walls, and\r\nsuch like couert where the Sunne may reflect against them, and if they\r\nbe planted on open beds or borders, then you must with Poales and other\r\nnecessaries support them and hold them vp, least the winde shake their\r\nrootes and hinder their growing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the red Rose.]\r\n\r\nThe red _Rose_ is not fully so tender as the Damaske, neither is it so\r\npleasant in smell, nor doubleth his leaues so often; yet it is much\r\nmore Phisicall, and oftner vsed in medicine, it is likewise fitter to\r\nbe planted then sowen, and the earth in which it most ioyeth would be a\r\nlittle rough or grauelly, and the best compasse you can lay vnto it, is\r\nrubbish or the sweeping of houses, the moneths to sowe or plant it in\r\nis March or September, & the time to prune and cut away the superfluous\r\nbranches is euer the midst of October.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the white Rose.]\r\n\r\nThe white _Rose_ is of lesse smell then the red, and will grow in a\r\nharder ground, his vse is altogether in Phisicke as for sore eyes and\r\nsuch like: it will grow into a Trée of some bigge substance, and is\r\nseldome hurt with frosts, stormes, or blastings: it would likewise be\r\nplanted from the roote against some high wall, either in the moneth of\r\nFebruary or March, and the oftner you plant and replant it, the doubler\r\nand larger the flower will be: for the earth it much skilleth not,\r\nbecause it will grow almost in euery ground, onely it delights most in\r\nthe shadow, and would be seldome pruned, except you finde many dead\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Cinamon Rose.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cinamon Rose_, is for the most part sowen, and not planted, whence\r\nit comes that you shall euer sée the leaues single and little, the\r\ndelicacie thereof being onely in the smell, which that you may haue\r\nmost fragrant and strong, you shall take a vessell of earth, being full\r\nof small holes in the bottome and sides, and fill it with the richest\r\nearth you can get, being made fine and loose, then take Damaske _Rose_\r\nséedes which are hard, and sound, and stéepe them foure and twenty\r\nhoures in _Cinamon_ water, I doe not meane the distilled water, but\r\nfaire Conduit water, in which good store of _Cinamon_ hath bin stéeped,\r\nor boyled, or milk, wherin good store of _Cinamon_ hath bin dissolued,\r\nand then sow those séedes into the Pot, and couer them almost thrée\r\nfingers déepe, then morning and euening till they appeare aboue the\r\nearth, water them with that water or milke in which the seedes were\r\nstéeped, then when they are sprung vp a handfull or more aboue the\r\nground, you shall take them vp mould and all, and hauing drest a border\r\nor bed for the purpose, plant them so as they may grow vp against some\r\nwarme wall or pale, and haue the Sunne most part of the day shining\r\nvpon them, and you shall be sure to haue _Roses_ growing on them, whose\r\nsmell will be wonderfull pleasant, as if they had béene spiced with\r\n_Cinamon_, and the best season of sowing these is euer in March, at\r\nhigh noone day, the weather shining faire, and the winde most calme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To make the Cinamon Rose grow double.]\r\n\r\nNow if you would haue these _Roses_ to grow double, which is an Art yet\r\nhid from most Gardners, you shall at Michaelmasse take the vppermost\r\nparts of the Plante from the first knot, and as you graft either Plumme\r\nor Apple, so graft one into another, and couer the heads with earth\r\nor clay tempered with _Cinamon_-water, and they will not onely grow\r\ndouble, but the smell will be much swéeter, and looke how oft you will\r\ngraft and re-graft them, so much more double and double they will proue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Prouince Rose.]\r\n\r\nThe _Prouince Rose_ is a delicate flower for the eye more then the\r\nnose, for his oft grafting abateth his smell, but doubleth his leafe\r\nso oft that it is wonderfull, therefore if you will haue them large\r\nand faire, you shall take the fairest Damaske _Roses_ you can get,\r\nand graft them into the red _Rose_, and when they haue shot out many\r\nbranches, then you shall graft each seuerall branch againe with new\r\ngrafts of another grafted Damaske _Rose_: and thus by grafting graft\r\nvpon graft, you shall haue as faire and well coloured _Prouince Roses_,\r\nas you can wish or desire: and thus you may doe either in the Spring or\r\nfall at your pleasure, but the fall of the leafe is euer helde the best\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To make Roses smell well.]\r\n\r\nNow if your _Roses_ chaunce to loose their smels, as it oft happeneth\r\nthrough these double graftings: you shall then plant _Garlicke_ heads\r\nat the rootes of your _Roses_, and that will bring the pleasantnesse of\r\ntheir sent vnto them againe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Generall notes touching Roses.]\r\n\r\nNow for your generall obseruations; you shall remember that it is good\r\nto water your _Roses_ morning and euening till they be gathered; you\r\nshall rather couet to plant your _Roses_ in a dry ground then a wette,\r\nyou shall giue them much shelter, strong support, and fresh dung twise\r\nat the least euery yeare, when the leafe is fallen, you shall cutte\r\nand prune the branches, and when the buds appeare you, then begin your\r\nfirst watring.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Lauender.]\r\n\r\n_Lauender_ is a flower of a hot smell, and is more estéemed of the\r\nplaine Country housewife then the dainty Citizen: it is very wholesome\r\namongst linnen cloathes, and would be sowen in a good rich mould, in\r\nthe moneths of March or Aprill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the white Lilly.]\r\n\r\nThe white _Lilly_ would be sowen in a fat earth, in the moneths of\r\nOctober and Nouember, or in March or April, and the séedes must be\r\nsowen excéeding thinne, not one by any meanes touching another, and the\r\nmould which couereth them must be sifted gently vpon them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To make Lillyes of any colour.]\r\n\r\nIf you would haue your _Lillyes_ of a purple colour, you shall stéepe\r\nyour séedes in the Lées of red wine, and that will change their\r\ncomplexion, and also you shall water the Plants with the same Lées\r\nlikewise: if you will haue them scarlet red, you shall put _Vermillion_\r\nor _Cynaber_ betwéene the rinde and the small heads growing about the\r\nroote: if you would haue them blew, you shall dissolue _Azure_ or\r\n_Byse_ betwéene the rinde and the heads, if yellow _Orpment_, if gréene\r\n_Verdigreace_, and thus of any other colour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To make Lillyes flourish all the yeere.]\r\n\r\nNow to make them flourish euery moneth in the yéere, you shall sowe\r\nyour séedes some a foote déepe, some halfe a foote, and some not two\r\ninches, so they will spring one after another, and flourish one after\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the wood Lilly.]\r\n\r\nThe wood _Lilly_ or _Lilly_ of the vale, delighteth most in a moyst\r\nground, and may be sowen either in March or September, it is very faire\r\nto looke on, and not so suffocating in smell as the other _Lillyes_ are.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the flower de Lice.]\r\n\r\nThe _flower de Lice_ is of excellent beauty, but not very pleasant to\r\nsmell to, it loueth a dry ground & an easie mould, and is fittest to be\r\nsowen in the moneth of March.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Pyonie.]\r\n\r\n_Pyonie_ or the blessed _Rose_, loueth a good fat earth being somewhat\r\nloose, and may be sowen either in March or September, it asketh not\r\nmuch watring, onely some support because the stalkes be weake.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Petillius.]\r\n\r\n_Petillius_ or _Indian eye_, may be sowen in any ground, for it\r\ndesireth neither much water, nor much dung, and the best season for\r\nsowing, it is Iune or September, for it will beare flowers commonly all\r\nthe Winter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Veluet flower.]\r\n\r\n_Veluet flower_ loueth a rich fertile ground, and must be much watred:\r\nthe season best for the sowing is August, for commonly it will beare\r\nflowers all the Winter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Gylliflowers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of grafting of Gylliflowers.]\r\n\r\n_Gilliflowers_ are of diuers kindes, as _Pynks_, _Wall-flowers_,\r\n_Carnations_, _Cloue Gilliflowers_, and a world of others, which\r\nare of all other flowers most swéet and delicate: all but the\r\n_Wall-gilliflower_ loue good fertile earths, and may be sowen either\r\nin March, Iuly, or August. They are better to be planted of Slips\r\nthen sowen, yet both will prosper. They are very tender, and therfore\r\nthe best planting of them is in earthen Pots, or halfe Tubs, which at\r\nyour pleasure you may remoue from the shade to the Sunne, and from the\r\nroughnesse of stormes to places of shelter, they grow vp high on long\r\nslender stalkes, which you must defend and support with square cradles\r\nmade of stickes, least the winde and the waight of the flowers breake\r\nthem: these _Gilliflowers_ you may make of any colour you please, in\r\nsuch sort as is shewed you for the colouring of _Lillyes_, and if\r\nyou please to haue them of mixt colours you may also, by grafting of\r\ncontrary colours one into another: and you may with as great ease graft\r\nthe _Gylliflower_ as any fruit whatsoeuer, by the ioyning of the knots\r\none into another, and then wrapping them about with a little soft\r\nsleau’d silke, and couering the place close with soft red Waxe well\r\ntempered. And you shall vnderstand that the grafting of _Gylliflowers_\r\nmaketh them excéeding great, double, and most orient of colour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the smels of Gylliflowers.]\r\n\r\nNow if you will haue your _Gylliflowers_ of diuers smels or odours,\r\nyou may also with great ease, as thus for example: if you will take\r\ntwo or thrée great cloues, & stéepe them foure and twenty houres in\r\nDamaske _Rose_ water, then take them out and bruise them, and put them\r\ninto a fine Cambricke ragge, and so binde them about the heart roote\r\nof the _Gylliflower_, néere to the setting on of the stalke, and so\r\nplant it in a fine, soft, and fertile mould, and the flower which\r\nspringeth from the same, will haue so delicate a mixt smell of the\r\nCloue and the Rose-water, that it will bréede both delight and wonder.\r\nIf in the same manner you take a sticke of _Cinamon_, and stéepe it\r\nin _Rose_ water, and then bruise it, and binde it as afore-said, all\r\nthe flowers will smell strongly of _Cinamon_: if you take two graines\r\nof fat Muske, and mixe it with two drops of Damaske _Rose_ water, and\r\nbinde it as afore-said, the flowers will smell strongly of Muske,\r\nyet not too hot nor offensiue, by reason of the correction of the\r\n_Rose_ water: and in this sort you may doe either with _Amber-greece_,\r\n_Storax_, _Beniamin_, or any other swéet drugge whatsoeuer; and if in\r\nany of these confections before named, you stéepe the séedes of your\r\n_Gylliflowers_ foure and twenty houres before you sowe them, they will\r\ntake the same smels in which you stéepe them, onely they will not be so\r\nlarge or double, as those which are replanted or grafted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Wall Gylliflower.]\r\n\r\nNow for your _Wall Gylliflower_, it delighteth in hard rubbish, limy,\r\nand stonie grounds, whence it commeth that they couet most to grow\r\nvpon walles, pauements, and such like barraine places. It may be sowen\r\nin any moneth or season, for it is a séede of that hardnesse, that it\r\nmakes no difference betwixt Winter and Sommer, but will flourish in\r\nboth equally, and beareth his flowers all the yéere, whence it comes\r\nthat the Husbandman preserues it most in his Bée-garden; for it is\r\nwondrous swéet, and affordeth much honey. It would be sowen in very\r\nsmall quantity, for after it haue once taken roote, it will naturally\r\nof it selfe ouer-spread much ground, and hardly euer after be rooted\r\nout. It is of it selfe of so exéeding a strong and swéet smell, that it\r\ncannot be forced to take any other, and therefore is euer preserued in\r\nits owne nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Helytropian.]\r\n\r\nThe _Helytropian_ or flower of the Sunne, is in nature and colour like\r\nour English _Marigold_, onely it is excéeding huge in compasse, for\r\nmany of them will be twenty, and foure and twenty inches in compasse,\r\naccording to the fertilenesse of the soyle in which they grow, and the\r\noft replanting of their rootes, they are excéeding goodly to looke on,\r\nand pleasant to smell, they open their flowers at the rising of the\r\nSunne, and close them againe at the Sunne setting, it delighteth in any\r\nsoyle which is fertile either by Art or Nature, and may be sowen in any\r\nmoneth from February till September, the oft planting and replanting of\r\nthe roote after it is sprung a handfull from the earth, maketh it grow\r\nto the vttermost bignesse, it would haue the East and West open vpon\r\nit, onely some small Pent-house to kéepe the sharpnesse of the winde\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Crowne Emperiall.]\r\n\r\nThe _Crowne-Emperiall_, is of all flowers both forraigne and home-bred,\r\nthe delicatest and strangest: it hath the true shape of an Emperiall\r\nCrowne, and will be of diuers colours, according to the Art of the\r\nGardner. In the middest of the flower you shall sée a round Pearle\r\nstand, in proportion, colour, and orientnesse, like a true naturall\r\nPearle, onely it is of a soft liquid substance: This Pearle if you\r\nshake the flower neuer so violently will not fall off, neither if you\r\nlet it continue neuer so long, will it either encrease or diminish in\r\nthe bignesse, but remayneth all one: yet if with your finger you take\r\nand wipe it away, in lesse then an houre after you shall haue another\r\narise in the same place, and of the same bignesse. This Pearle if you\r\ntaste it vpon your tongue, is pleasant and swéet like honey: this\r\nflower when the Sunne ariseth, you shall sée it looke directly to the\r\nEast, with the stalke bent lowe there-vnto, and as the Sunne ariseth\r\nhigher and higher, so the flower will likewise ascend, and when the\r\nSunne is come into the _Meridian_ or noone poynt, which is directly\r\nouer it, then will it stand vpright vpon the stalke, and looke directly\r\nvpward, and as the Sunne declineth, so will it likewise decline, and at\r\nthe Sunne setting looke directly to the West onely. The séedes of this\r\nflower are very tender, and therefore would be carefully sowen in a\r\nvery rich and fertile earth well broken and manured. The seasons most\r\nméete for the same, is the latter end of March, Aprill, or May, for the\r\nflowers flourish most in May, Iune, and Iuly. As soone as it is sprung\r\na handfull aboue the earth; you shall remoue it into a fresh mould,\r\nand that will make it flourish the brauer: the roote of this flower is\r\nlike an Apple, or great flat Onion, and therefore in the replanting of\r\nit, you must be carefull to make a hole large and fitte for the same,\r\nand to fixe the mould gently and close about the same. In the Winter\r\nit shrinketh into the earth, and is hardly or not at all discerned, by\r\nmeanes whereof I haue séene diuers supposing it to be dead, to digge\r\nvp the earth, and negligently spoyle the roote, but be not you of that\r\nopinion, and in the Spring you shall sée it arise and flourish brauely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Dulippo.]\r\n\r\nThe _Dulippo_ is but a little short of the _Crowne Emperiall_ in\r\npleasantnesse and rarenesse, for you may haue them of all colours\r\nwhatsoeuer, in such sort as was shewed you for the _Lillyes_,\r\n_Gylliflowers_, and other rootes: they are tender at their first\r\nspringing from the séede, and therefore must be sowen in a fine rich\r\nmould, in the warmth of the Sunne, either in March, Aprill, or May:\r\nbut after they are once sprung aboue the ground, they are reasonable\r\nhard, and will defend themselues against most weathers: the roote of\r\nthis flower is shaped like a Peare, with the biggest end downeward, and\r\nmany small thréeds at the bottome; therefore you must be sure when you\r\nremoue or replant it, to couer all the roote in fresh mould, and let\r\nnot any part of the white thereof be vncouered: this flower by monethly\r\nreplanting, you may haue to flourish in all the Summer moneths of the\r\nyeare, for in the dead of Winter it shrinketh into the ground, and is\r\nhardly or not at all perceiued, the stalkes of these flowers are weake,\r\ntherefore to support them, and defend them from the shakings of the\r\nwindes with little square frames of stickes, will be very good and\r\nnecessary, it must be oft watred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Hyacinth.]\r\n\r\nThe _Hyacinth_ is a flower more delicate to the eye then nose, and\r\nis of a good strong nature, for it will endure any reasonable earth,\r\nand may be sowne in any moneth of the Spring, from the beginning of\r\nFebruary till midde-Iune: it onely hateth tempests and stormes, and\r\ntherefore is commonly sowen or planted néere vnto walls or other\r\nshelter. You may haue them of any colour you please, as is shewed\r\nbefore of other flowers, and in this alteration or mixture of colours\r\ntheir greatest glorie appeareth, they will flourish all the Summer\r\nlong, and if they stand warme, appeare very early in the Spring.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Narcissus.]\r\n\r\nThe _Narcissus_ is a very curious and dainty flower, and through his\r\nmuch variety and alteration in growing, they are supposed to be of\r\ndiuers kindes, but it is not so, for in as much as they are séene to\r\nbe of diuers colours, that is but the Art of the Gardner, as is before\r\nexprest in other flowers, and whereas some of them grow single, some\r\ndouble, and some double vpon double, you shall vnderstand that such as\r\ngrow single, grow simply from the séede onely, those which are double\r\nand no more, are such as haue béene planted and replanted, the small\r\nthréeds of the rootes being clipt away, and nothing left about it\r\nthat is superfluous, and those which are double vpon double, are the\r\ndouble plants grafted one into another. This _Narcissus_ loueth a rich\r\nwarme soyle, the mould being easie and light, it may be sowne in any\r\nmoneth of the Spring, and will flourish all the Summer after. Before it\r\nappeare aboue ground it would be oft watred, but after it skils not how\r\nlittle, for it will defend it selfe sufficiently.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Daffadill, Colombine, and Chesbole.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An excellent Caution.]\r\n\r\nNot vnlike vnto this is your _Daffadill_ of all kindes and colours,\r\nand in the same earths and seasons delighteth either to be sowen or\r\nplanted, and will in the same manner as your _Narcissus_ double and\r\nredouble his leaues; so will your _Colombine_, your _Chesbole_, and\r\nalmost any hollow flower whatsoeuer. Many other forraigne flowers\r\nthere are which grow plentifully in our Kingdome: but the order of\r\ntheir planting and sowing differeth nothing from these which I haue\r\nalready declared, being the most tender and curious of all other,\r\ntherefore I will end this Chapter with this one _caution_ onely, that\r\nwhen you shall receiue any séede from any forraine Nation, you shall\r\nlearne as néere as you can the nature of the soyle from whence it\r\ncommeth, as hot, moyst, colde, or dry it is, and then comparing it with\r\nours, sowe it as néere as you can in the earth, and in the seasons that\r\nare néerest to the soyle from whence it came, as thus for example: if\r\nit came from a clime much hotter then ours, then shall you sowe it in\r\nsandie mould or other mould made warme by strength of meanure, in the\r\nwarmest time of the day, and in those moneths of the Spring, which are\r\nwarmest, as Aprill or May, you shall let it haue the Sunne fréely all\r\nthe day and at night, with Mats, Penthouse, or other defence shield it\r\nfrom sharpe windes, frosts, or colde dewes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A new manner of planting flowers and fruits.]\r\n\r\nI haue séene diuers Noblemen and Gentlemen, which haue béene very\r\ncurious in these dainty flowers, which haue made large frames of wood\r\nwith boards of twenty inches déepe, standing vpon little round whéeles\r\nof wood, which being made square or round according to the Masters\r\nfancie, they haue filled with choyse earth, such as is most proper to\r\nthe flower they would haue grow, and then in them sowe their séedes, or\r\nfixe their Plants in such sort, as hath béene before described, and so\r\nplacing them in such open places of the Garden, where they may haue the\r\nstrength and violence of the Sunnes heate all the day, and the comfort\r\nof such moderate showers, as fall without violence or extraordinarie\r\nbeating, and at night draw them by mans strength into some low vaulted\r\ngallery ioyning vpon the Garden, where they may stand warme and safe\r\nfrom stormes, windes, frosts, dewes, blastings, and other mischiefes\r\nwhich euer happen in the Sunnes absence, and in this manner you may not\r\nonely haue all manner of dainty outlandish flowers, but also all sorts\r\nof the most delicatest fruits that may be, as the _Orenge_, _Limond_,\r\n_Pomgranate_, _Poncythron_, _Cynamon-tree_, _Oliue_, _Almond_, or any\r\nother, from what clime so euer it be deriued, obseruing onely but to\r\nmake your frames of wood, which containes your earth, but déeper and\r\nlarger, according to the fruit you plant in it, and that your Alleys\r\nthrough which you draw your Trées when you house them be smooth and\r\nleuell, least being rough and vneuen, you iogge and shake the rootes\r\nwith the waight of the Trées, which is dangerous. And least any man may\r\nimagine this but an imaginary supposition, I can assure him that within\r\nseauen miles of London, the experiment is to be séene, where all these\r\nfruits and flowers with a world of others grow in two Gardens most\r\nabundantly. Now for such flowers or fruits as shall be brought from a\r\ncolder or more barraine ground then our owne, there néedeth not much\r\ncuriosity in the plantation of them, because a better euer bringeth\r\nforth a better encrease, onely I would wish you to obserue, to giue all\r\nsuch fruits or flowers the vttermost liberty of the weather, & rather\r\nto adde coolenes by shaddow, then encrease any warmth by reflection,\r\nas also to augment showers by artificiall watrings, rather then to let\r\nthe roote dry for want of continuall moysture; many other notes and\r\nobseruations there are, which to discouer, would aske a volume larger\r\nthen I intend, and yet not be more in true substance, then this which\r\nis already writ, if the Reader haue but so much mother-wit, as by\r\ncomparing things together, to draw the vses from the true reasons, and\r\nto shunne contrary by contraries, which what Husbandman is so simple,\r\nbut he can easily performe, and hauing the true grounds of experience,\r\nframe his descant according to his owne fancie, which is a Musicke best\r\npleasing to all men, since it is not in any one mans power to giue a\r\ngenerall contentment. And thus much for flowers, and their generall and\r\nparticular ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_How to preserue all manner of seedes, hearbs, flowers, and fruits,\r\nfrom all manner of noysome and pestilent things which deuoure and hurt\r\nthem._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Thunder and Lightning.]\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to bequeath and giue your séedes vnto the ground, and\r\nthen immediatly to expect (without any further industrie) the fruit of\r\nyour labours, no goodnesse seldome commeth with such ease: you must\r\ntherefore know that when you lay your séedes in the ground, they are\r\nlike so many good men amongst a world of wicked ones, and as it were\r\ninuironed and begirt with maine Armies of enemies, from which if your\r\ncare and diligence doe not defend them the most, if not all, will\r\ndoubtlesse perish, and of these enemies the worst and most violentest\r\nis _Thunder_ and _Lightning_, which in a moment killeth all sorts of\r\nflowers, plants, and trées, euen in the height and pride of their\r\nflourishing, which to preuent, it hath béene the practise of all the\r\nauncient Gardners, to plant against the walles of their Gardens, or in\r\nthe middest of their quarters, where their choysest flowers grow, the\r\n_Lawrell_ or _Bay_ Trée, which is euer helde a defence against those\r\nstrikings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Caterpillers.]\r\n\r\nNext vnto _Thunder_ and _Lightning_ are _Caterpillers_, which are a\r\nkinde of filthy little wormes, which lye in Cobwebs about the leaues,\r\ndeuouring them, and poysoning the sap, in such sort, that the Plant\r\ndieth spéedily after: the way to kill these, is to take strong Vrine\r\nand Ashes mixt together, and with it to dash and sprinkle all the\r\nPlants cleane ouer, and it will both preuent their bréeding, or being\r\nbred will kill them: the smoake of Brimstone will doe the like, yet if\r\nthey be excéeding much abundant, the surest way to destroy them, is to\r\ntake olde, rotten, mouldy Hay, and setting it on fire, with the blaze\r\nthereof burne the Cob-webs, and then with the smoake smother and kill\r\nthe wormes, and they will hardly euer bréede in that place againe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Toades and Frogges.]\r\n\r\nNext these are _Toades_ and _Frogges_, which are very poysonous and\r\ngreat destroyers of young Plants, chiefly in their first appearing\r\naboue the ground, and the auncient Gardners haue vsed to destroy them\r\nby burning the fat of a Stagge in some part of the Garden beds, from\r\nwhich earth all creatures that haue poyson in them, will flye with all\r\nviolence: other Gardners will watch where the Kite pearcheth on nights,\r\nand gathering vp her dung, scatter it vpon the beds either simply, or\r\nmixt with the shauings of an olde Harts horne, and no venemous thing\r\nwill come néere it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the field Myce.]\r\n\r\nNext these are field _Myce_, which will roote séedes out of the earth,\r\nand deuoure them aboundantly, which to kill you shall take _Henbane\r\nseede_, and beate it to pouder, and then mixing it with swéete Oyle,\r\nfresh Butter, or Grease, make thereof a bayte; and when you finde\r\nwhere they scratch or roote, lay some part of the bayte in that place,\r\nand they will gréedily eate it, and it will kill them: there be other\r\nGardners which will take a Wéesell, and burning it to ashes, scatter\r\nthe ashes on the beds, and then no field _Mouse_ will come néere them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Flyes.]\r\n\r\nNext these are _Flyes_, as flesh-_Flyes_, _Scarabs_, _Hornets_,\r\n_Dores_, and such like, which are great destroyers of Séeds and Plants,\r\nwhen they appeare in their first leafe, and are soft and tender, which\r\nto destroy, you shall either take _Orpment_ mixt with milke, or the\r\npouder of _Allome_, or the ashes of any of these _Flyes_ burnt, and\r\nwith it sprinkle your beds and young plants all ouer, and it will kéepe\r\n_Flyes_ that they will not dare to come néere them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the greene Fly.]\r\n\r\nIf the gréene _Fly_, which of all other _Flyes_ is most gréedie to hurt\r\nSéedes and Plants, doe offend your Garden, you shall take _Henbane_\r\nleaues, _Houseleeke_, and _Minte_, and beat them in a Morter, then\r\nstraine forth the iuyce, and then adde thereto as much Vinegar as\r\nwas of all the rest, and there-with sprinkle your beds all ouer, and\r\nthe gréene _Fly_ will neuer come néere them. Some hold opinion, that\r\nif you plant the hearbe _Rocket_ in your Garden, that it is a safe\r\npreseruatiue against these gréene _Flyes_, for it is most certaine that\r\nthe very smell thereof will kill these, and most sorts of all other\r\n_Flyes_ whatsoeuer, as hath béene found by approued experience, and the\r\nsylts of olde auncient Abby Gardens, which a man shall seldome finde\r\nwithout this hearbe planted in them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Gnats.]\r\n\r\nNext these are _Gnats_, which although it be the smallest of all Flyes,\r\nyet it is the greatest, quickest, and sharpest deuourer of tender\r\nPlants of all other, for it biteth déeper and more venemously sharpe,\r\nthen those which are of much bigger substance: the best way to destroy\r\nthem is morning and euening, to smoake and perfume your beds either\r\nwith wet Rosemary, or with mouldy Hay: some vse to burne _Calamint_,\r\nand some Oxe dung, and sure all are very good, for the smoakes are very\r\nsharpe, and styflle as soone as it is receiued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Pismyers.]\r\n\r\nNext these are _Pismyers_, which also are very noysome vnto Gardens,\r\nfor they will digge vp, and carrie away the smaller séedes to their\r\nhills, and in short space spoyle and deface a bed of his encrease, and\r\nthe best way to destroy them, is, if you finde their hill, to poure hot\r\nscalding water vpon them: or if vpon your Garden beds you strowe Ashes\r\nor Lyme, but especially that which is made of chalk, they will by no\r\nmeanes come néere them, as you shall finde by experience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Moales.]\r\n\r\nNext these are _Moales_, which digging and vndermining the earth,\r\nturneth vp Séedes and Plants in a confused fashion, to the vtter\r\ndestruction and ruine of the Husband-mans labour, the cure whereof is\r\nto take them in such sort, as shall be shewed in this Booke, where I\r\nspeake of Pasture grounds; but if you finde that their encrease and\r\ncontinuance multiply with your labour, it shall be then good for you\r\nto plant in diuers places of your Garden the hearbe called _Palma\r\nchristi_, in other places _Garlickes_ and in other places _Onyons_, and\r\nit is an assured rule that no _Moale_ will come néere where they grow\r\nfor the strength and violence of their smell, is poysonous and deadly\r\nto those blind vermines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Snailes.]\r\n\r\nNext there are _Snailes_ of both kindes, blacke and white, which are\r\nas much offensiue to Gardens, as any other crawling thing, for they\r\nféed of the tender leaues of plants, and of the outmost rindes of the\r\ndaintiest hearbs or flowers, the way to destroy them, is to sprinkle\r\nvpon the beds and other places of their aboad good store of chimney\r\nsoote, which by no meanes they can endure, because it is mortall and\r\npoysonous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Moathes.]\r\n\r\nNext there are _Moathes_ or _Moaghts_, which are very pernitious in\r\na Garden, for they destroy both Séeds and Plants, and there is not\r\nbetter or more certaine way to kill them, then by taking olde horse\r\nhoofes, and burning them, with the smoake thereof to perfume all the\r\nplaces where they abide, and it will in an instant kill them; with this\r\nsmoake onely you may kéepe Arras hanging, Tapistrie, Néedle-worke,\r\nCushions, or Carpets, or any woollen cloath or garment whatsoeuer safe\r\nfrom _Moathes_ as long as you please, neither néede you to vse it aboue\r\nonce or twice a yéere at the most, as shall be more at large in another\r\nplace declared.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Cankers.]\r\n\r\nNext these are _Cankers_, which are a kinde of filthie wormes, which\r\ndeuoure both the great and small leaues of all sorts of swéet Plants,\r\nespecially _Lettuce_, _Cabbadge_, _Colaflours,_ and such like; and the\r\nway to destroy them, is to scatter amongst your Plants, Goose-dung,\r\nor to sprinkle the iuyce thereof with a wispe of _Rue_, or hearbe of\r\n_Grace_ ouer all the beds, and though some with a rustie knife vse to\r\nscrape them from the leaues, and so kill them on a Tyle-shread, yet for\r\nmy part I hold this the néerer way, and both more certaine and more\r\neasie, as experience will approue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Garden Wormes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An excellent experiment.]\r\n\r\nLastly, are your Garden _Wormes_ which liuing in the hollowes of the\r\nearth féede much vpon your tender Garden séedes, and the soft sprouts\r\nwhich first issue from them, especially from all sorts of kirnels, in\r\nwhich they delight more then in any other séede whatsoeuer, as you may\r\nfinde by experience, if you please to obserue accidents as they happen,\r\nwithout which obseruation you shall hardly attaine to the perfection\r\nof an excellent Gardner: for if you please to make this triall, take\r\nthe kirnels of a faire sound Pippin, and deuide them into two parts,\r\nthen sowe the one halfe in a Garden bed well drest and trimmed for the\r\npurpose, where the worme hath liberty to come and goe at his pleasure,\r\nsowe the other halfe in some riuen boule, earthen pot, or halfe Tub,\r\nmade for the purpose with the same earth or mould that the bed is, and\r\nthen set the vessell so as no worme may come there-vnto, and you shall\r\nfinde that all those Séedes will sprout and come forth, when hardly any\r\none of those in the bed of earth will or can prosper, there being no\r\nother reason but the extreame gréedinesse of the deuouring worme, which\r\nto preuent, you shall take Oxe dung, and burn it to ashes, then mixe\r\nthem with the earth where-with you couer your Séedes, and it will both\r\nkill the wormes, and make the Séedes sprout both sooner and safer. And\r\nthus much for the preseruation of Séeds and Plants, from all noysome\r\nand pestilent creatures, which being practised with care and diligence,\r\nwill giue vnto euery honest minde the satisfaction he desireth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The conclusion of the Kitchen Garden.]\r\n\r\nNow to conclude this small tract or Treatise of the Husbandmans\r\n_Kitchen Garden_, I would haue euery honest Reader vnderstand, that I\r\nhaue not taken vpon me to modell out any curious shape or proportion,\r\nbut onely figured out a perfect nourcerie, shewing you how to bréed\r\nand bring vp all things fit for health or recreation which being once\r\nbrought to mature and ripe age, you may dispose into those proper\r\nplaces which may become their worthinesse, in which worke I would haue\r\nyour owne fancy your owne directour, for I may giue preheminence to\r\nthat you least like, and disestéeme that most which to you may séeme\r\nmost worthy, therefore let your owne iudgement order your Garden, like\r\nyour house, and your hearbs like your furniture, placing the best in\r\nthe best places, & such as are most conspicuous, and the rest according\r\nto their dignities in more inferiour roomes, remembring that your\r\ngalleries, great chambers, and lodgings of state doe deserue Arras,\r\nyour Hall Wainscote, and your meanest offices some _Boscadge_, or\r\ncleanly painting: from this alligorie if you can draw any wit, you may\r\nfinde without my further instruction how to frame Gardens of all sorts\r\nto your owne contentment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SECOND PART\r\n  OF THE SECOND BOOKE\r\n  of the _English Husbandman_: Contayning\r\n  the ordering of all sorts of VVoods, and\r\n  the breeding of Cattell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_Of the beginning of Woods, first sowing, and necessarie vse._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wood better then Gold.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The excellent vses of Wood.]\r\n\r\nIt is a Maxime held in Plantations, that no land is habitable, which\r\nhath not Wood & Water, they two being as it were the only nerues &\r\nstrength of a mans safe and wholesome liuing, and I haue heard many\r\nwise Gentlemen, exercised, and ingaged, in the most noble and euer\r\nlaudable workes of our new Plantations, both of _Virgina_ and the\r\nSummer-_Ilands_ affirme, that they had rather, for a generall profit,\r\nhaue a fertile wholesome land, with much wood, then (wanting wood)\r\nwith a Mine of gold: so infinite great is the vse of Timber (whose\r\nparticulars I néede not rehearse) and so insufferable is the want,\r\nwhen we are any way pinched with the same. And hence it springeth that\r\nour olde auncestors (whose vertues would God we would in some small\r\nmeasure imitate) when they found any hard and barraine earth, such as\r\nwas vnapt for grasse; or at least such as bare but grasse that would\r\nkéepe life, not comfort life, they presently plowed it vp, and sowed\r\nthereon Acornes, Ash-keyes, Maple knots, Béech apples, Hawes, Slowes,\r\nNuts, Bullis, and all other séeds of trées in innumerable quantity,\r\nas may appeare by the Forrests of _Del la mere_, _Sherwood_, _Kings\r\nwood_, and many other within this kingdome of huge great spaciousnes\r\nand compasse, from whom when the wood is spoiled, the soyle serueth to\r\nlittle or no purpose, except it be the kéeping aliue of a few poore\r\nshéepe, which yéeld but little profit more then their carkasse. Thus\r\neuen from the first age of the world hath our forefathers béene euer\r\nmost carefull to preserue and encrease wood, and for mine owne part I\r\nhaue euer obserued in all those places where I haue séene Woods decayed\r\nand destroyed, that the charge of stubbing and other necessaries\r\nallowed; those lands haue neuer againe yéelded the former profit, for\r\nthe greatest exhaustment that euer I saw of wood ground was to bring it\r\nto tenne shillings an Acre when it was conuerted to pasture, and being\r\nkept to wood, it was worth euery seauentéenth yéere one and twenty\r\npound. A simple Auditor may cast the account of this profit, but such\r\nis our gréedinesse, that for our instant vse we little respect the\r\ngood of ours, or our neighbours. But it is no part of my Bookes method\r\nto call offences to question, but onely to right the Husbandman in\r\nhis iourney to ordinarie profit. Know then that there is nothing more\r\nprofitable to the Husbandman, then the encreasing and nourishing of\r\nwood; from whence (as our common lawes termes it) springs these thrée\r\nbootes or necessary commodities, to wit House-boote, Plowe-boote, and\r\nFire-boote, without the first we haue neither health, couert, ease,\r\nnor safety from sauage beasts: without the second we cannot haue the\r\nfruits of the earth, nor sustenance for our bodies, nor without the\r\nlast can we defend off the sharp Winters, or maintaine life against\r\nthe numbing colds which would confound vs. The consideration of these\r\nthrée things only, might enduce vs to the preseruation of this most\r\nexcellent commodity: but the other infinite necessities & vses which\r\nwe make of wood, as shipping, by which we make our selues Lords of the\r\nSeas: fencing which is the bond of concord amongst neighbours: solution\r\n& trial of Mines, from whence springs both our glory in peace, and our\r\nstrength in warre, with a world of others sutable vnto them, should be\r\nmotiues vnresistable to make vs with all diligence hast to the most\r\npraise-worthy labour of planting wood, in euery place and corner, where\r\nit may any way conueniently be receiued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plantation of Wood.]\r\n\r\nIf then the Husbandman shall liue in a high barraine Countrey (for\r\nlow-valleyes, marshes, or such grounds as are subiect to inundations,\r\nseldome nourish wood well) or in a soyle though not vtterly barraine,\r\nyet of so hard and sower encrease, that the hearbage doth in the profit\r\nbut in small quantity, I would wish him after a generall triall of\r\nhis earth, to deuide it into thrée equall parts, the first and the\r\nfruitfullest I would haue him preserue for pasture for his Cattell of\r\nall kindes: the second and next in fertility for corne, being no more\r\nthen those cattell may till, and the last & most barraine to imploy\r\nfor wood: which though he stay long for the profit, yet will pay the\r\ninterest double. And this ground thus chosen for wood, I would haue\r\nhim plowe vp from the swarth about the latter end of Februarie, and\r\nif it be light earth, as either sand, grauell, or a mixt hazel earth,\r\nthen immediatly to sow it with Acornes, Ash-keyes, Elme & Maple knots,\r\nBéech-apples, Chesnuts, Ceruisses, Crabs, Peares, Nuts of all kindes,\r\nHawes, Hips, Bullice, Slowes, and all manner of other wood séeds\r\nwhatsoeuer, and as soone as they are sowne with strong Oxe harrowes of\r\niron, to harrow and breake the earth, in such sort, that they may be\r\nclose and safely couered. And in the plowing of this earth, you must\r\ndiligently obserue to turne vp your furrowes as déepe as is possible,\r\nthat the séede taking strong and déepe roote, may the better and with\r\nmore safety encrease, and defend it selfe against stormes and tempests,\r\nwhereas if the roote be but weakely fixed, the smallest blasts will\r\nshake the Trées, and make them crooked, wrythen, and for small vse but\r\nfire onely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fencing of young woods.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When cattell may graze in Springs.]\r\n\r\nAfter you haue harrowed your earth, and laide your séede safe, you\r\nshall fence your ground about with a strong and large fence, and\r\nhedge, ditch, pale, or such like, which may kéepe out all manner of\r\nfoure-footed beasts, for comming within the same, for the space of\r\ntenne yéeres after: for you shall vnderstand, that if any cattell\r\nshall come where young wood is péeping aboue the earth, or whilst it\r\nis young, tender, and soft, they will naturally crop and brouse vpon\r\nthe same, and then be sure that the wood which is so bitten, will neuer\r\nprosper or spring vp to any height, but turne to bushie shrubs and\r\nill-fauoured tufts, pestring the ground without any hope of profit,\r\nwhereas if it be defended and kept safe the space of tenne yéeres at\r\nthe least, it will after defend it selfe, and prosper in despight\r\nof any iniurie: and then after that date you may safely turne your\r\ncattell into the same, and let them graze at pleasure, and surely you\r\nshall finde it a great reliefe for your young beast, as your yearling\r\nHaiffers, Bullocks, Colts, Fillies, and such like: for I would not wish\r\nyou to let any elder cattell come within the same, because the grasse\r\nthough it be long, yet it is sower and scowring, and by that meanes\r\nwill make your cattell for labour weake and vnhealthie, whether it be\r\nOxe or Horse, and for milch-Kine, it will instantly dry vp their milke,\r\nbut for idle heilding beasts, whose profit is comming after, it will\r\nserue sufficiently.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vse of the clay ground for Wood.]\r\n\r\nNow if the earth whereon you sowe your wood, be a stiffe clay ground,\r\nand onely barraine through the extreamitie of colde, wet, or such like,\r\nas is séene in daily experience: you shall then plowe vp the ground at\r\nthe end of Ianuarie in déepe furrowes, as is before rehearsed; and then\r\nlet it rest till it haue receiued two or thrée good Frosts, then after\r\nthose Frosts some wet, as either snow or raine, and then the next\r\nfaire season after sowe it, as afore-said, and harrow it, and you shall\r\nsée the mould breake and couer most kindely, which without this baite,\r\nand order, it would not doe, then fence it as afore-said, and preserue\r\nit from cattell for tenne yéeres after.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A speciall note.]\r\n\r\nAnd here is to be noted that one Oake growing vpon a clay ground, is\r\nworth any fiue which growes vpon the sand, for it is more hard, more\r\ntough, and of much longer indurance, not so apt to teare, ryue, or\r\nconsume, either with Lyme, Rubbish, or any casuall moysture, whence\r\nit comes that euer your Ship-wrights or Mill-wrights desire the clay\r\nOake for their vse, and the Ioyner the sand Oake for smoothnesse and\r\nwaynscote. And thus much for the sowing of Wood, and his generall vses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_The deuision of vnder-Woods, their sale, and profit._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The deuision of Woods.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The valew of vnder-wood.]\r\n\r\nWhosoeuer be a Lord or Master of much vnder-wood, which is indéede\r\nyoung spring-wood of all kindes, growing thicke and close together,\r\neither from the séede, as is declared in the former Chapter, or from\r\nthe rootes of former salles, the first being a profit begotten by him\r\nselfe, the other a right left by purchase or inheritance, and desire,\r\nas it is the dutie of euery vertuous husband, to make his best and\r\nmost lawfullest profit thereof, hauing not left vnto him any president\r\nof former commodity. In this case you shall suruay the whole circuit\r\nof your wood, with euery corner and angle there vnto belonging, and\r\nthen as your abilitie and the quantity of your ground shall afford,\r\nyou shall deuide your whole wood either into twelue, seauentéene, or\r\none and twenty parts of equall Acres, Roodes, or Rods, and euery yeare\r\nyou shall sell or take to your owne vse one of those parts, so that\r\none following yearely after another, our sales may continue time out\r\nof minde, and you shall imploy as you please so much wood euery yeare\r\nof either twelue, seauentéene, or one and twenty yeares growth. And in\r\nthis you shal note that the sale of one and twenty, doth farre excéede\r\nthat of seauentéene, and that of seauentéene as farre that of twelue:\r\nbut in this it is quantity, and your necessity that must direct you,\r\nand not my demonstration: for there be fewe Husbands but know that an\r\nAcre of one and twenty yéeres growth, may be worth twenty, nay thirty\r\npounds, that of seauentéene worth eight or ten pounds, and that of\r\ntwelue, fiue and sixe pounds, according to the goodnesse of the wood,\r\ninsomuch that the longer a man is able to stay, the greater sure is\r\nhis profit: but fewell and fence must of necessity be had, and if a\r\nman haue but twelue acres of wood, I sée not but he must be forced to\r\ntake euery yéere one acre for his owne reliefe, and if hée take more,\r\nhée must either necessarily spoyle all, or driue himselfe into extreame\r\nwant in fewe yeares following: and therefore it is méete that euery\r\ngood husband shape his garment according to his cloath, and onely take\r\nplenty where plenty is; yet with this husbandly caution that euer the\r\nelder your sale is, the richer it is, as you may perceiue by the well\r\nhusbanded Woods of many Bishoprickes in this land, which are not cut\r\nbut at thirtie yeares growth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the sale of vnder-woods.]\r\n\r\nWhen you haue made your deuisions according to your quantity, you\r\nshall begin your sale at an out-side where cariages may enter without\r\nimpeachment to the springs you intend not to cut, and a pole or halfe\r\npole according to the quantity of ground, you shall preserue (being\r\nnext of all to the outmost fence) to repaire the ring fences of your\r\nWood, and to seperate the new sale from the standing Wood: and this\r\namongst Woodwards is called Plash-pole. Then at the latter end of\r\nIanuarie you may begin to cut downe your vnder-wood, and sell it either\r\nby acres, roodes, perches, poles, roddes, or dozens, according to the\r\nquantitie of your earth, or the abilitie of your buyers. And in this\r\nsale I cannot set you downe any certaine price, because true iudgement,\r\nand the goodnesse of your wood must onely giue you direction, things\r\nbeing euer valewed according to their worth and substance, and this\r\nsale or the cutting downe of vnder-wood, you may continue from the\r\nlatter end of Ianuarie, till midde Aprill, at which time the leafe\r\nbegins to bud forth, or somewhat longer if necessitie vrge you: the\r\nlike you may also doe from the beginning of September, at which time\r\nthe leafe beginnes to shed till the middest of Nouember.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to cut vnder-woods.]\r\n\r\nNow for the manner of cutting downe your vnder-woods, although the\r\nlawes of the Kingdome shew you what dutie you shall performe therein,\r\nwhat Timber you shall preserue, and how néere each Weauer shall stand\r\none to another, yet I would wish you both for your owne and the\r\nCommon-wealths sake, to performe somewhat more then that to which you\r\nare by law compelled, & therefore you shall giue direction to your\r\nwood fallers, that when they shall méete with any faire and straight\r\nwell growne sapling, Oake, Elme, Ash, or such like, to preserue them,\r\nand let them stand still, being of such fit distance one from another,\r\nthat they may not hinder or trouble each other in their growing, and\r\nwhen you shall finde vpon a cluster many faire Plants or Saplings; you\r\nshall view which is the fairest of them all, and it preserue onely, and\r\nthe rest cut away, that it may prosper the better: also if you finde\r\nany faire and well growne fruit Trées, as Peares, Chesnuts, Seruisses,\r\nand such like, you shall let them stand and cleare them from the\r\ndroppings of the taller trées, and you shall finde the profit make you\r\nrecompence. Now for the generall cutting vp of the wood, you shall cut\r\nit about sixe inches aboue the ground, and drawing your strokes vpward,\r\ncut the wood slope-wise, for that is best to hasten on the new Spring;\r\nand those Weauers or young which you preserue and suffer to growe\r\nstill, you shall prune and trimme as you passe by them, cutting away\r\nall superfluous branches, twigges, and young spyers, which shall grow\r\neither néere vnto the roote, or vpon any part of the boale, which is\r\nfit to be preserued for Timber, and if you shall finde that the earth\r\nhaue by any casualty forsaken the root, and left it bare, which is\r\nhurtfull to the growth of the Trée, you shall lay fresh earth vnto it,\r\nand ram the same hard and fast about it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fencing of salles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Woodwards duty.]\r\n\r\nThus when you haue made an end of cutting downe your sale, and that\r\nthe wood is cleansed and carried away, and all the loose and scattered\r\nstickes raked vp into seuerall heapes, and caried away also; for it is\r\nthe part of euerie good husband and Woodward, not to sée any wood lye\r\nand rot vpon the ground; you shall then with the vnder-wood preserued\r\nin the Plash-pole, deuide by a strong hedge this new cut downe sale\r\nfrom the other elder growne wood, and for tenne yéeres, as before is\r\nspoken, not suffer any foure-footed beast to come within the same; from\r\nwhich rule you shall learne this lesson, that it is the Woodwards duty\r\neuery day to looke ouer all his young Springs, and if by any mischance\r\nor negligence cattell shall happen to breake into them (as many times\r\nthey doe) then shall he not onely driue forth or impound such Cattell,\r\nbut also suruay how farre and which Plants they haue cropt, and hauing\r\nspied them, with his wood Bill, presently cut the Plants so brouzed\r\nclose by the bottomes of the last shuts, and then they will newly put\r\nforth againe, as well as if they had neuer béene hindred: which done,\r\nhe shall finde out where the cattell brake in; and then mend the same,\r\nso well and sufficiently, that it may preuent the like mischiefe.\r\nAlso if these young springs shall stand néere vnto Forrests or elder\r\nWoods, which are full of wilde Deare, and be no purlewes belonging vnto\r\nthe same, the Woodward then shall neuer walke without a little dogge\r\nfollowing him, with which he shall chase such Deare out of his young\r\nsprings, because it is to be vnderstood, that the brouzing of Deare is\r\nas hurtfull to young wood, as that of any other cattell whatsoeuer.\r\nAnd thus much touching the ordering and gouernment of vnder-woods, with\r\ntheir sales, and the nourishing vp of greater Timber.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of High Woods, and their Plantation._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What high Woods are.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The beginning of high Woods.]\r\n\r\nHigh Woods are those which containe onely Trées for Timber, and are not\r\npestred or imbraced with the vnder growth of small brush wood, such\r\nas Hazels, White-thorne, Sallowes and Poplar are; these for the most\r\npart consist of Oakes, Ash, Elme, Béech, Maple, and such like, growing\r\nso remote and seperate one from another, that although their tops and\r\nbranches méete, and as it were infolde one within another, yet at\r\nthe rootes a man may walke or ride about them without trouble. These\r\nhigh Woods had their first beginnings from the séeds, as was before\r\ndeclared, and nourisht from age to age amongst the vnder-woods, which,\r\nwhen men began to want foode for their bréede-Cattell, and that from\r\nthe super-abundance of young Woods, they found some might conueniently\r\nbe spared, they forth-with in stead of cutting downe their young wood\r\naboue the earth, began to digge it vp by the rootes, and with stubbe\r\nAxes to teare the meane sinewes from the ground, so that it might not\r\nrenew or encrease againe, and then leuelling the earth, and laying it\r\nsmooth and plaine, to leaue nothing standing but the tall Timber trées,\r\nbetwéene which the grasse had more libertie to growe, and Cattell more\r\nabundance to féede on, and all be not so long and well able to fill the\r\nmouth, as that which growes in the thicke springs, yet much more swéet\r\nand better able to nourish any thing that shall graze vpon the same, by\r\nreason that the Sunne and Frosts hauing more frée power to enter into\r\nthe ground, the earth is so much the better seasoned, and bringeth\r\nforth her encrease with more swéetnesse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Plantation of high Woods.]\r\n\r\nSome are of opinion, that these high Woods may as well be planted as\r\nsowne, and that many of them from the first beginning haue béene so, to\r\nwhich opinion I consent in part: for doubtlesse I am perswaded, that\r\nmany small Groues of Ash, Elme, Béech and Poplar haue béene planted,\r\nfor we sée in our daily experience, and the new walkes in _More-fields_\r\nby _London_, are a perfect testimonie, that such Plantations may\r\nbe without trouble or danger: but for the Oake to be taken vp and\r\nreplanted, is very hard, and very seldome in vse, neither shall a man\r\nin an whole Age sée any Oake remoued come to perfection or goodnesse,\r\nbut growe crooked, knottie, and at the best, but for the vse of fewell\r\nonely: but for the other before rehearsed, you may remoue them when\r\nthey are a dozen yeares of age, and plant them where you please: and if\r\nthe earth haue in it any goodnesse at all, they will take root and grow\r\nboth spéedily, and plentifully. And since I am thus farre entred into\r\nthe plantation of Woods, I will shew you how you shall plant and remoue\r\neuery Trée in his due manner and season.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Planting the Elme.]\r\n\r\nAnd first for the planting of the Elme, which is an excellent Trée for\r\nshadow, and the adorning of walkes or dwelling houses, you shall make\r\nchoise of those Plants which are straightest, soundest, the barke euen\r\nand vntwound, and at least eightéene or twenty inches in compasse:\r\nthese you shall digge out of the ground, roote and all, then at the\r\ntop of the head, about thrée fingers vnder the knot, where the maine\r\narmes seuerally issue forth, you shall a little slope-wise cut the head\r\ncleane off them, and mixing clay and a little horse-dung, or fine ashes\r\ntogether, couer the head round about there-with, then ouer the same\r\nwrap Mosse, or fine Hay, and binde it about with soft clouen Oziers,\r\nor some such like bands, then with a sharpe pruning Bill cut euery\r\nseuerall branch of the roote within a finger or two of the stocke;\r\nwhich done, and the roote pickt cleane, you shall make a hole to be\r\ndigged in the place, where you meane to plant the Elme iust of that\r\ndepth, the hole was from whence you digged out the Elme, that so much\r\nand no more of the Elme may be hidden in the earth, then was formerly\r\nat his remouing; and this hole you shall make spacious and easie; and\r\nthat the mould be soft and loose both vnderneath and round about the\r\nroote of the Elme, which done, you shall place your Elme in the same,\r\nstraight and vpright, without either swaruing one way or other, which\r\nfor your better certaintie, you may proue either with plumbe, leuell,\r\nor other instrument, which being perfected, you shall with rich fresh\r\nmould well mixt with olde meanure, couer and ram the same fast in the\r\nearth, in such sort, that no reasonable strength may moue or shake it:\r\nand all this worke must be done in the encrease of the Moone, either in\r\nthe moneth of October, or at the latter end of Ianuary: but the latter\r\nend of Ianuarie is euer helde the best and safest, for there is no\r\nquestion but you shall sée flourishing Trées the next Summer after: and\r\nin this sort you may likewise remoue either Béech, Witcher, or Popler,\r\nbestowing them either in Groues, Walkes, Hedge-rowes, or other places\r\nof shadow, as shall séeme best to your contentment: for their natures\r\nbeing alike, their growthes and flourishings haue little difference.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Planting the Ash.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Obiection.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Answere.]\r\n\r\nNow for the replanting or remouing the Ash, though not much, yet there\r\nis some difference, for it is not at the first so spéedie a putter\r\nforth, and flourisher, as the others be: but for the first yeare\r\nlaboureth more to bestow and fixe his roote in the earth, then to\r\nspread forth his vpper branches, and although some Woodwards are of\r\nopinion, that so much as the Ash is aboue the ground, so much hée will\r\nbe vnder before he begin to flourish outwardly, yet experience doth\r\nfind it erronious, for though it be for the first yéere a little slower\r\nthen other Trées, yet when it beginneth to flourish, it will ouer-take\r\nthe spéediest grower. Therefore when you do intend to plant Ashes for a\r\nspéedy profit, you shall not according to the olde custome chuse the\r\nsmooth, small, long Plants, which are hardly thrée inches in compasse,\r\nand haue put out hardly any branches, and are such as grow from the\r\nrootes of elder Ashes cut downe before, which our auncient Woodwards\r\nhaue vsed to slip or cleaue from those rootes, no, these are the\r\nworst sorts of Plants: but you shall take the true ground-Ash, which\r\nspringeth from his owne proper roote, being smooth, euen, sound, and\r\nstraight without bruise, canker, or other impediment. This you shall\r\ndigge vp by the root, being as is before said almost twenty inches in\r\ncompasse, and hauing cleansed the roote, you shall leaue each spray\r\nnot aboue halfe a foote, or eight inches in length; but for the small\r\nthréeds or tassels of the roote, those you shall cut cleane away close\r\nby the wood, and so plant it in euery point, as was shewed you for the\r\nplanting of the Elme, onely the top thereof you shall by no meanes cut\r\noff, because it is a trée of pith, which to deuide or lay bare, were\r\nvery dangerous; and the best season for the planting of this Trée, is\r\neuer in the encrease of the Moone, at the fall of the leafe, which is\r\nfrom the beginning of October till midde Nouember, and at no other\r\ntime, for it would euer haue a whole Winter to fasten his roote, and to\r\ngather strength, that it may bud forth his leafe the Summer following.\r\nThus you sée how you may plant Groues or Copses at your pleasure, and\r\nmake vnto your selfe high Woods according to your owne pleasure. But\r\nyou will obiect vnto me, that you liue in such a champaine Countrey,\r\nthat albe these Plantations might bréede vnto you infinite pleasure,\r\nyet the pouerty thereof in wood is such that these Plants are not\r\nthere to be found for any money. To which I thus answere, That in this\r\nKingdome there is not any Country so barraine, or farre off remote from\r\nwood, being a soyle fit to receiue wood: But his next neighbour-Country\r\nis able to furnish him, especially with these Plants at an easie\r\nreckoning: as for example, I hold _Northampton_ shire one of the\r\nbarrennest for Wood, yet best able to beare wood, and hath not he his\r\nneighbour _Huntington_ shire and _Leicester_ shire about him, where\r\nnurceries of these Plants are bred and preserued for the sale onely:\r\nNay, euen in _Holland_, in _Lincolne_ shire, which is the lowest of all\r\nCountries, and most vnlikely to holde such a commodity, I haue séene\r\nas goodly Timber as in any Forrest or Chase of this Kingdome: and thus\r\nmuch for the planting of high Woods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the preseruation, and sale of high Woods._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Trees which take wet inwardly.]\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient for the Husbandman to sowe, plant, and encrease\r\nwood about his grounds, conuerting his earth to the vttermost and\r\nextreamest profit that may spring from the same: but he must also\r\nbe diligent to preserue and nourish his timber trées from all\r\ninconueniences that may any way annoy or afflict them: and to this\r\nend hée shall daily walke into his Woods, and with a searching eye\r\nsuruay euery Trée which is of any account, and sée if he can finde any\r\nfault or annoyance about the same, and if casting his eye vp to the\r\ntop, where the maine armes shoote forth themselues, he perceiue that\r\nby the breaking off of some arme or other riuen boughes, the wet and\r\ndroppings of the leaues is sunke and fretted into the Timber, which in\r\ntime will corrupt the heart, and make the Trée hollow. In this case he\r\nshall presently mount the Trée, and with his Bill, either cut the place\r\nso smooth that the wet may not rest thereon, or else hauing smoothed\r\nit so much as he may with conuenience, mixe stiffe clay and fine hay\r\ntogether, and with the same couer the place, in such manner, that it\r\nmay put off the wet till it haue recouered new barke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Barke-bound.]\r\n\r\nIf hée shall perceiue any of his younger Trées to be Barke-bound, that\r\nis, so stiffe and straitly tied within their owne ryndes, that they\r\ncannot encrease or prosper: in this case he shall with a sharpe drawing\r\nknife, made in the proportion of a narrow _C_ draw and open the barke\r\neuen from the top of the bole of the Trée downe to the roote, and then\r\nclap Oxe dung into those slits, let the Trée rest, and in short space\r\nyou shall sée it mightily encrease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Hornets and Dores.]\r\n\r\nIf he shall perceiue that _Hornets_, and _Dores_, or such like, haue\r\nfound some little hollownesse in one of his Trées, and séeketh there\r\nto shelter and hide themselues, which in little space they will soone\r\nmake larger, he shall forth-with besmeare all the place with Tarre and\r\nGoose-dung, and it will driue them thence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Canker.]\r\n\r\nIf he shall finde that by the droppings of other Trées, some of his\r\nTrées shall grow cankerous, and loose their barke, which is an accident\r\nvery vsuall, and the Trées whose barkes are so lost, will with great\r\ndifficulty after prosper. In this case he shall annoynt the place with\r\nTarre and Oyle mixt together, and then couer the place with clay, where\r\nthe barke is wanting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Pismyers.]\r\n\r\nIf he shall perceiue any _Pismyer_ hilles or beds to be made against\r\nany of his Trées, which is very noysome, for they are great destroyers\r\nof the barks of Trées: he shall then with hot scalding water kill them,\r\nand throw the hill downe leuell and plaine with the earth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Iuy, Woodbine, and Misseltoe.]\r\n\r\nIf he shall find any _Iuy_, _Woodbine_, or _Mysteltoe_ to grow in or\r\nabout any of his principall Trées, which doe strangle, suffocate, and\r\nkéepe them from encreasing, he shall forth-with digge vp the roots\r\nthereof, and then cut it away or loosen it from about the barks of the\r\nTrées.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Thunder and Lightning.]\r\n\r\nLastly, if he shall perceiue that by _Thunder_, _Lightning_, or other\r\nplantarie stroakes, any of the armes of his well growne Trées be\r\nblasted or slaine, he shall forth-with cut them away, euen close to the\r\nquicke Wood, and make the place smooth and euen where they were ioyned:\r\nthus shall the carefull Husbandman with a vigilant eye, regard euery\r\nenormous and hurtfull thing that may offend his Timber, and by that\r\nmeanes possesse more benefit from a fewe Roodes, then others doe from\r\nmany Acres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the sale of tall Woods.]\r\n\r\nNow when either necessity or the vrgent occasions of any néedfull vse,\r\nenforceth the Husbandman to make sale of any part of his tall Wood,\r\nin which Marchandise there is many prety and obscure secrets, such as\r\nare hard to be shewed by any Verball demonstration, for truly there\r\nis not any trucking or marting whatsoeuer, in which a man may sooner\r\ndeceiue, or be deceiued, men buying and selling in a manner hood-winkt:\r\nfor it is most certaine that no man can certainely tell either what\r\npeny-woorth hée selleth, or the other buyeth, so long as the Trée is\r\nstanding, there be in Trées so many secret faults, and likewise when\r\nthey are downe, and come to the breaking or burkning (as the Wood-man\r\ntearmes it) so many vnexpected vertues, as for mine owne part I haue\r\noften séene a Trée whose out-side hath promised all good hope, the\r\nbarke being smooth and euen, the body large and great, and the armes\r\nhigh set on, and spaciously extended; yet when this Trée hath béene\r\nfelled, and came to burkning, there hath béene found a hole in the\r\ntop, which hath runne cleane though the heart, and vtterly spoyled the\r\nwhole Timber: so likewise on the contrary part I haue séene a Trée very\r\nfoule at the top, which is suspitious for rottennesse, whose armes haue\r\ngrowne so close and narrow together, that they haue promised little\r\nburthen, yet being cut downe, I haue séene that Trée passing sound, the\r\narmes double the loades in valuation, and the price being lesse then\r\nany, the proofe and goodnesse to excéede all; so that I must conclude\r\nit all together impossible to set downe any fixed or certaine rules\r\neither for the buyer or seller: but for as much as there are diuers\r\nworthie obseruances for both parts, and that it is as necessary to buy\r\nwell as sell well, I will runne through euery particular obseruation,\r\nwhich doth belong both to the one and the other partie, with which\r\nwhen a mans minde is perfectly acquainted, he may with much bolder\r\nconfidence aduenture to buy or sell in the open Market.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to chuse Timbers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Mill Timber.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Timber to beare burthen.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing therefore that either buyer or seller should be\r\nskilfull in, is the choyse of all sorts of Timbers, and to know which\r\nis fit for euery seuerall purpose, the crooked and vneyely being for\r\nsome vses of much higher price and reckoning then that which is plaine,\r\nstraight, and euen growne, as thus for example. If you would buy Timber\r\nfor Mill-whéeles, the heads of round Turrets, or any kinde of any worke\r\nwhatsoeuer, you shall chuse that which is crooked and some-what bent,\r\nbeing sound, firme, and vnshaken. If you will chuse Timber for Summer\r\nTrées, Baulks, Iawnies, or Tracens, you shall chuse that which is most\r\nhartie, sound, and much twound, or as it were wrythen about, which you\r\nshall with great ease perceiue by the twinding or crooked going about\r\nof the barke, the graine whereof will as it were circle and lay round\r\nabout the Trée. This Timber which is thus twound or wrythen, will by no\r\nmeanes ryue or cleaue asunder, and therefore is estéemed the best to\r\nsupport and beare burthen, and the heart thereof will endure and last\r\nthe longest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Timber for Pales, Wainscote, &c.]\r\n\r\nIf you will chuse Timber for Pales, Singles, Coopers-ware, Wainscote,\r\nor such like, then you shall euer chuse that which is smooth, euen, and\r\nstraight growne, without any manner of twynding or shaking, which you\r\nshall perceiue by the straight and euen growing vp of the barke, whose\r\ncrests will ascend straight and vpright, euen from the roote to the\r\nbottome, which is an assured token that all such Timber will shiuer and\r\nryue into as thinne parts as a man would desire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Timber for Pyles or Water-workes.]\r\n\r\nLastly, if you would chuse Timber to make Pyles of, to driue into the\r\nearth, for the framing of Weares within the water, the heads of Ponds,\r\nor any other worke within the water then you shall chuse that which is\r\nmost knottie (so it be sound) for that will driue without splitting,\r\nand continue in the earth the longest: and of all Timbers the Elme\r\nis accounted the best for this purpose, for it will continue almost\r\neuerlastingly in the earth without rotting; yet notwithstanding, the\r\nOake is excellent good also: and thus much for the generall choise of\r\nOakes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vse of the Elme.]\r\n\r\nNow if you would chuse Timber for weather-boards, or to be vsed in\r\nwater-workes, or to make Planks for low moyst Vaults, then you shall\r\nchuse the biggest, soundest and smoothest growne _Elme_, it is also\r\nexcellent good to make Kitchen tables of, or for boards, for the vse\r\nof Butchers. If you will chuse the most principallest Timber, for\r\nCart or Waine Axel trées, for the naues of whéeles, or for any other\r\nvse of toughnesse, you shall chuse the _Elme_ onely, for it excéedeth\r\nall other Timbers, and though some Husbandmen are of opinion, that\r\nthe _Elme_ Axel-trée when it is throughly heated, is then most apt to\r\nbreake, they are much deceiued, for it will endure farre beyond Ash or\r\nany other Timber, except Yewgh, which for the scarsity is now of little\r\nvse in such a purpose. And herein you must obserue, that the _Elme_\r\nwhich you chuse for Axel-trées must be straite, smooth, and without\r\nknots, but that which you chuse for naues, must be most knotty, twound,\r\nand the hardest to be broken or hewed asunder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vse of the Ash.]\r\n\r\nIf you will chuse Timber for Ploughes, ordinary Axel-trées (for\r\nthose of _Elme_ are speciall) the rings of whéeles harrow bulls, and\r\nsuch like, then you shall chuse the fairest, straightest, biggest,\r\nand smoothest growne Ash that you can finde, and from the roote end\r\nvpward, you shall cut out a length of Axel-trées, aboue it a length of\r\nshelbordes, and aboue it (if the Trée be so large) a length for heads\r\nand Skeathes, the largest armes which are somewhat bending, you shall\r\nelect for rings for whéeles, and so according to the bignesse of the\r\nAsh, and as your eye can proportion out what will be made of the same,\r\nyou shall make valuation thereof.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vse of the Wall-nut tree.]\r\n\r\nIf you would chuse Timber for ioyned Tables, Cupbords, or Bedsteds,\r\nyou shall then make choise of the fairest Walnut-trée you can finde,\r\nbeing olde, straight, vnknotted, and of a high boale: and although\r\neither Oake, or Ash will reasonably well serue for this purpose, yet\r\nthe Walnut-trée is by many degrées the best of all other, for it is\r\nof smoothest graine, and to the eye most beautifull, prouided that by\r\nno meanes you put it into any worke, before it be excéedingly well\r\nseasoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vse of the Peare-tree.]\r\n\r\nIf you would chuse Timber for Ioynt-stooles, Chaires, or Chests, you\r\nshall then chuse the oldest Peare-trée so it be sound, for it is both\r\nsmooth, swéet, and delicate, and though it be a very soft Wood, yet\r\nin any of these frames it is an excéeding long laster, and the heart\r\nthereof will neuer bréede worme, nor will it in any time loose the\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vse of the Maple, Beech, and Poplar.]\r\n\r\nIf you would chuse Timber for Trenchers, Dishes, or any Tourners ware,\r\nor for any in-laying worke, you shall then make choise of the fairest\r\nand soundest Maple, being smooth and vnknotted, for it is the plainest\r\ngraine, and the whitest Wood of all other: and although either the\r\nBéech or Poplar will reasonably well serue for these purposes, yet is\r\nneither the colours so good, nor the Timber so long lasting. Many other\r\nTrées there are which may serue for many other purposes: but these are\r\nof most vse for our English Husbandman, and will sufficiently serue to\r\npasse through all his businesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Char-coale.]\r\n\r\nTouching Char-coale, you shall vnderstand, that Oake, Elme, and Ash,\r\nmake your longest and best enduring Coale: the Birtch the finest and\r\nbrightest Coale, and the Béech or Sallow the swiftest Coale. Now for\r\nyour small Coale, the twigges of the Birtch makes that which kindles\r\nthe soonest, and the White-thorne that which endures the longest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to value Timber.]\r\n\r\nThus when you know how to chuse euery seuerall Trée, and the true vse\r\nand profit which can any way be made of the same, and by a practised\r\nexperience can cast by the suruay and view of a standing Wood, the\r\nalmost entire profit that may arise from the same, deuiding in your\r\nmemory how many are for euery seuerall purpose, and to what reckoning\r\nthey may amount one with the other, and blemishing (if you buy) the\r\ngood with the bad, or making good (if you sell) the bad with those\r\ngood ones which grow néere them, you may then boldly venture into any\r\nsale either as a buyer or seller at your pleasure, and sure if you\r\nknow (as it is fit you should doe) the Market-able prices of all sorts\r\nof Timbers in those places, where you are either to buy or sell, as\r\nwhat a Mill-post is worth, what so many inches of well squared Timber,\r\ncontayning so many foote in length, what a dozen of boards of such a\r\nsize, what so many naues, spoakes, rings, sparres, or tracens, or what\r\nso much sound and good Plough-timber is worth, and then looking vpon a\r\nTrée, and computing what may euery way be made of the same, allowing\r\nthe wast which will hardly sometimes defray the charge of breaking vp\r\nthe Trée, you cannot but with great ease draw into your minde the true\r\nvalue of euery Trée, and the vttermost profit or losse may any way rise\r\nfrom the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to measure Timber by gesse.]\r\n\r\nAnd in this worke I would haue you to obserue this rule very carefully,\r\nthat is, when you come to any great Timber-trée, to fathome or embrace\r\nit about with both your armes, and then knowing what quantity your\r\nfathome is, and how many fathome girdleth the Trée round about, you may\r\nfrom former experience giue a certaine gesse what inches of squared\r\nTimber that Trée will beare, for if you haue found in former trials\r\nthat twice your fathome in the rough barke hath borne twenty, or two\r\nand twenty inches squared, and now finde that the present Trée on which\r\nyou looke, is no lesse, but rather with the bigger, you may boldly\r\npresume, that being sound, this trée can carrie no lesse square of good\r\nTimber: and thus much for the knowledge and choise of tall Woods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Best seasons for the sale.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The time for Chap-men.]\r\n\r\nNow to come to the seasons & fittest times for sale of these high\r\nWoods: you shall vnderstand that it is méete for euery good husband\r\nwhich intendeth to sell any of his high Woods, to walke into the same\r\nimmediately after Christmas, & whether they be in woods, Groues,\r\nhedge-rowes, or other places, to marke with a special marke all those\r\nTrées which he intendeth to sell, as well for the wéeding and cleansing\r\nout of all such as are decayed and wasted, as also to know the true\r\nnumber of both the good and bad, and thereby in some measure to compute\r\nthe profit which will arise from the same, for to make sale of them\r\notherwise confusedly, might bring much losse to a man happily, selling\r\naway those that would encrease their valewes, and kéepeing them which\r\ndaily would decrease their goodnesse, or so vnorderly vnmixing his\r\nWood, that where one faire and good Trée would draw a mans eye from\r\nbeholding diuers which are doated, now that onely taken away, the rest\r\nwill remaine, and neuer be sale-able, and therefore euer as néere as\r\nyou can so suite and match your Trées together, that in your sales\r\nyou may neuer passe away an absolute worthie Trée: but you may euer\r\ncouple some which haue defects to goe with it, as in these dayes we sée\r\nWarriners and Poulters sell Rabbets, a fat and a leane euer coupled\r\ntogether. When you haue thus marked out what you meane to sell, and\r\ndisposed your sale according to your best profit, after notice giuen\r\nvnto the Country in the Market Townes néere adioyning, you shall begin\r\nyour sale the Candlemasse following, which sale you may continue all\r\nthe Spring, according to the greatnesse thereof, or the quicknesse of\r\nbuyers. Now for any rules or orders to be obserued in these sales, I\r\ncan prescribe you none certaine, because it is méete that euery one\r\nbinde himselfe to the customes of the Country in which he liueth,\r\nwhose variations are diuers, for almost euery one is seuerall, onely\r\nin the maine they holde together, which is that they seldome make\r\npublike sales for money downe vpon the head, but for a certaine payment\r\nsome fewe moneths after, which makes the Marchandise more lookt to,\r\nand the sales goe away the faster; and in this the Sales-man must be\r\ncircumspect in the choise of his Chap-men, and where hée findeth any\r\ndoubt there to make one neighbour stand bound for another, as for\r\nthe earnest penny it is euer ouer and aboue the price, and must be\r\nlaide downe at the binding vp of the bargaine, which earnest is in\r\nsome Countries foure pence in the pound, in some eight pence, and in\r\nsome twelue pence, according to the goodnesse of the Timber, and hath\r\neuer béene taken for a fée due to the Sales-man for his paines and\r\nattendance: and sure if he be carefully honest, it is a merrit well\r\nbestowed: if otherwise, it is much too much for falshood, for in him\r\nconsists the owners losse or profit, and therefore it may become any\r\nman, of what place so euer, to take a strickt account from such an\r\nofficer: or if he haue any doubt euer to ioyne with him in commission,\r\nanother of contrary faction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When to cut downe Timber.]\r\n\r\nWhen you haue made sale of your Timber, you shall by no meanes let it\r\nbe cut downe till the end of Aprill, at which time the sap ascending\r\nvpward, will loosen the bark, and make it come from the body of the\r\nTrée easily. You shall cut your Timber downe close by the earth, not\r\ndigge it vp by the rootes, vnlesse you meane vtterly to destroy it, for\r\nfrom the spurnes of the roote will arise new Spiers, which in processe\r\nof time, will come to another Trée. As soone as you haue felled your\r\nOakes, you shall with your Axe immediatly whilst the sap is wet, take\r\nall the barke from the body and the armes, and setting it end-wayes\r\nas vp one by another, so place it, that the winde may passe through\r\nit, and dry it, and then sell it to the Tanners, which will giue you a\r\ngood price therefore, according to the worth and scarsity thereof. When\r\nyour Trées are barkt, you shall then sawe the body into such lengthes\r\nof Timber, as shall be méete for the purpose for which it is bought,\r\nor in such sort as it may be best portable: the armes also you shall\r\nhewe from the body, and so burken or breake them vp, as they may be fit\r\nto be loaded: all which done, and the Timber caried away, you shall,\r\nif you intend to haue the Wood renew, fence in the sale, and kéepe it\r\nsafe from Cattell: and thus much for the preseruation and sale of high\r\nWoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of the breeding of Wood in rich champaine soyles._\r\n\r\n\r\nNature which is the most perfect worke-mistresse of all things (as all\r\nthe Philosophers say) but I say our good God out of his most diuine\r\nwisedome, hath allotted to euery soyle, if we will note it, through\r\nthe whole course of this Kingdome, particular profit to sustaine and\r\nmaintaine it, as to some Mines, to some Timber, and to some fertility\r\nof grasse and corne, and where any one of these are, there commonly\r\nsome of the other is euer wanting, as we sée daily in our experience;\r\nand for as much as in the fruitfull and fertill soyles of this\r\nland, of which wée estéeme the wealthie vales, as that of _Essam_,\r\n_White-horse_, _Beluoire_, and many others the best, there is euer\r\ngreat scarsitie of Wood, the very wealthinesse of the soyle it selfe\r\nalmost denying to beare such burden, because for the most part the\r\nstifnesse of those clayes is contrary to their growth, yet for as much\r\nas the necessitie and vse of Wood is so great and valuable, I would\r\nperswade euery good and worthy Husbandman, to endeauour himselfe with\r\nall his vtmost power and strength, to plant wood in euery conuenient\r\nplace round about him, and not to take the rules of the ignorant for\r\nhis lesson, that sith neuer any did grow there, therefore neuer any\r\nwill grow there: for it is absurd and foolish: nor to say because my\r\nauncestors haue neuer done it why should I attempt it? These arguments\r\nare made from a false figure, and the Husbandman must remember that\r\nhis dutie is industrie, and encrease not altogether imitation and\r\npresident, and he must as seriously finde out new and néerer profits,\r\nas hold those he hath learned: and therefore he shall endeauour by all\r\ncommendable labour to haue euer about him whatsoeuer is necessarie for\r\nhis vse: but you will peraduenture aunswere me, that to plant Woods\r\nin these rich soyles, were very much losse, because the fertilitie\r\nthereof will yéeld a much better profit. To this I reply, that I\r\nwould not haue you plant any spacious piece of ground with wood, but\r\nonely your ditches, hedges, and such wast earthes, as almost denie\r\nany other profit, and that the want of wood in those places may not\r\ndiscourage you, to imagine that wood will not grow there. Doe but\r\nview the cytes of euery Towne in those rich Countries, the seates\r\nof Noblemen & Gentlemens houses, and the Parks which commonly are\r\nadioyning there-vnto, and you shall hardly sée any of them without the\r\nfellowship & acquaintance of some wood, which in times past hath béene\r\nplanted either for defence or pleasure, and from thence collect that if\r\nwood will grow with my next neighbour, then why not with me, so long\r\nas the soyle doth not alter. But _Labor vincit omnia improbus_, True\r\nindustrie was neuer fruitlesse. Then for the generall good both of your\r\nselfe & your neighbours, looke that you replenish all your ditches &\r\nring fences, with good store of Quick-set, that is to say, all that lye\r\nhigh, & out of the danger of water, with White-thorne, Black-thorne,\r\nand Bryer, and those which are low & subiect to washing, with Willowes,\r\nSallowes, and Ozyers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to set all sorts of Quick-set.]\r\n\r\nNow for as much as it is not enough to say vnto the Husbandman do\r\nthis, but that I must also shew the manner of doing thereof: I will\r\nshew you briefly how to set all manner of Quick-sets, and first\r\nfor the white-thorne, black-thorne, bryer or such like, which must\r\nstand frée from inundation, you shal when you enclose any piece of\r\nground, after you haue markt out the true breadth of your dyke vpon\r\nthe in-side thereof, and close by the verdge of the dyke, cut with\r\nyour spade a little trough, halfe a foote or there-abouts in breadth\r\n& depth, in which trough or small gutter, you shall lay the rootes\r\nof the first rowe of your Quick-sets, so as the top ends may looke\r\nvpward, & a little bend in towards the ditch, & these quick-sets you\r\nshall place within lesse then a foot one of another: then with your\r\nspade beginning to make your ditch, you shall with the first cleane\r\nmould, couer all the rootes close and fast, so as they will not shake\r\nnor stirre with your hand, then hauing raised the banke of your Dyke,\r\nand couered the lowest rowe of Quick-set more then halfe a foote, and\r\nbroken the earth so, as it may lye close and handsome together & you\r\nshall then after the same manner lay another rowe of Quick-set ouer the\r\nfirst, I meane not one Quick-set directly ouer another, but the second\r\nrowe placed as it were in the midst betwéene two of the first, though\r\nat least halfe a foote higher: then you shall couer that row like the\r\nformer, and ouer it place a third, which shall stand directly opposite,\r\nand ouer the first, so that in their growth the middle rowe shall as\r\nit were grow betwéene two of the lowest, and two of the highest: and\r\nthen vpon this vppermost rowe lay the remainder of your earth, and\r\nmake your banke perfect, and in this sort finishing one yard of the\r\nDitch after another, you shall at length bring your labour to the end\r\nof your desire. Now in this labour you are to obserue some speciall\r\nthings, as first to looke well vpon your Sets before you put them into\r\nthe ground, and be sure that they be gréene, young and vntainted, then\r\nthat the rootes be cleane, and no small thréeds or iagges hanging about\r\nthem. And lastly, that they stand vpright, and not aboue foure or fiue\r\ninches without the earth at the most, then shall you looke well to the\r\nmaking of your banke, and lay the earth so as it may not slip or fall\r\nbacke into the Dyke, so as the raine may wash away the mould, and leaue\r\nthe rootes bare: but let all things be done strongly and artificially.\r\nThe best seasons for this worke is the moneths of February, March,\r\nand Aprill, or September, October, and some part of Nouember: if the\r\nweather be dry aboue head, when you haue set your Quick-set, you\r\nshall make a dead hedge vpon the top of the new banke, to kéepe those\r\nCattell which are within your ground, from breaking forth or hurting\r\nthe Quick-set: and another small fence on the lowe verdge of the Dyke\r\nwhich is outward, to kéepe those cattell which graze without from\r\nrunning into the dyke, and hurting the quick-set. Now after a spring\r\nand fall is past, you shall suruay all your quick-set and wéede it\r\ncleane from all manner of filthinesse that doth choake or stifle it,\r\nand scratching the fresh mould about it giue comfort to the roote: then\r\nif you perceiue that any of your Sets be dead, you shall plucke them\r\nvp, and place new in the roome, and if any be blasted in part, and not\r\nclean killed, you shall cut away so much as is blasted, and let the\r\nrest remaine, you shall looke well to the Caterpiller and other wormes,\r\nwhich mightily deuoure Quick-sets, especially in these fat Countries,\r\nand if you finde any taint of them, destroy them as is shewed you in a\r\nformer Chapter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Planting of greater Trees.]\r\n\r\nAfter your Quick-set is come to the age of thrée yéeres, and that the\r\nbanke is setled and swarth growne thereon, you shall then within the\r\nbody of your hedges plant all manner of great Trées, as Ash, Béech,\r\nMaple, and such like, and also all manner of fruit Trées, as Aples,\r\nPeares, Plums, Wardens, and such like, and in the first thrée yéeres\r\nbe very carefull to preserue each in his true proper nature, and doe\r\nto them all the rights which is due to their growth, and in that time\r\nobserue which kinde of Trées in the generality prospereth best, and\r\nagréeth most naturally with the soyle. And of those Trées sée that\r\nyou flourish your grounds most plentifully, the particular manner of\r\nplanting whereof is already formerly declared. And hence doth _Kent_\r\nand _Worcester_ shire boast of their fruit, _Windsor_, _Sherwood_\r\nand _Hollam_ shire their Oakes, and other particular Countries their\r\nparticular commodities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the setting of Willowes, &c.]\r\n\r\nNow for the setting of Willow, Sallow and Oziers, it is a thing so\r\nvsuall and common, that it néedeth no great Art in the relation,\r\nyet because I would be loath that any omission should be taken for\r\nnegligence, you shall vnderstand that in setting them you must first\r\nrespect the place, which would euer be lowe and moyst, the water\r\nsometimes washing them, sometimes cooling them, and euer giuing them\r\ncomfort. Now to speake first of the Willow it would be euer planted\r\nvpon bankes, where it may stand more dry then wet, for such prosper\r\nbest, and endure longest, as for proofe some will continue, twelue,\r\nfiftéene nay one and twentie yéeres, where as those which are set close\r\nby the water, will hardly endure seueral, but not aboue nine yéeres at\r\nthe most. Touching their planting, they be set two manner of wayes,\r\nbut which is the best, is not yet agréed on amongst Husbandmen. The\r\nfirst is to take an Augure full as large in compasse (although much\r\nshorter) as that where-with you boare Pumps and with it boare a hole\r\nin the earth two-foote, and a halfe déepe, then hauing headed some of\r\nthe choysest Willowes you haue, take the fairest and straightest of\r\nthose lops, and then cutting the sloape-wise at both ends and leauing\r\nno superfluous twigs cleauing there-vnto, put the bigger end downe very\r\nhard into the earth, and then with the mould which came forth, with the\r\nAugure ram the earth close and hard about the Set, so as no reasonable\r\nstrength may shake it. Now there be other Husbandmen which in stéed\r\nof the Augure take onely an Oaken or Ash stake, of the bignesse of an\r\nvsuall set, and with a Béetell driue it into the ground two foot and a\r\nhalfe, and then by shaking and opening the earth, pull it out againe &\r\nthen put in the Set as is before shewed, and beate and tread the earth\r\nclose there-vnto, and there is no doubt of the well prospering thereof.\r\nNow for the defects which Husbandmen finde in these two seuerall\r\nplantings. Some say, that the Augure taketh out so much earth, that the\r\nSet cannot but stand loose at the roote, and so wanting full hold of\r\nthe earth, either takes not at all, or continues but a little space.\r\nOthers say that the driuing in of the stake beates the earth so hard\r\ntogether, that it withstandeth the passage of the tender sprouts, & so\r\nkilleth the set, but both are deceiued: for these are but suppositions,\r\nand experience daily shewes vs, that these are the best and spéediest\r\nwayes of setting of all sorts of Willowes that euer any time brought\r\nforth, and I haue knowne one man set this way two hundreth Sets in a\r\nday, of which not one hath failed, but all prospered. Now for your\r\nSallowes, you shall set them, and chuse the Sets in all poynts as you\r\ndoe the Willow, onely they would be placed a little néerer the water,\r\nfor they delight some-what more in moysture, as for the Ozier it would\r\nbe set like other Quick-set in the side of bankes, so as it may almost\r\ntouch the water, and as your Willowes or Sallowes would be set a little\r\nremote one from another, as namely tenne foote asunder: so these must\r\nbe set close together, and in thicke rowes one against another: and\r\nthese Ozier Plants you must cut from their head, being the principall\r\nspiers which grow thereon, and then cut off their tops, leauing them\r\nnot aboue two foote long at the most, and of all other they are the\r\nquickest in growing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vse of Willowes, Sallowes, and Oziers.]\r\n\r\nAnd although Willow, Sallow, and Ozyer, are in our lawes estéemed but\r\nas wéedes and no Woods, yet they be so profitable, that the Husbandman\r\ncan hardly misse them, the Willow and Sallow seruing for fence and\r\nfewell, to make Harrowes, Cart-saddles, & horse Hames, and the Ozyers,\r\nfor fish Leapes, or Wéeles for Baskets, Scuttels, Fans to winnow with,\r\nand many other things full as necessary: therefore if you haue any\r\nmarish grounds that are vselesse, bogge-myers, or Ilands in great\r\nriuers, let them be imployed to the nourishing of these profitable\r\nwéedes, and by making draynes through them to giue the water passage,\r\nyou shall in small time bring them to earthes of great profit, which\r\nconsideration were it rightly wayed, there would not be halfe so much\r\nwast ground as is in this Kingdome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ordering of the Willow.]\r\n\r\nBut to my purpose, when you haue planted these Willowes, you shall\r\nafter euery floud, sée if the water haue driuen any of them away, or\r\ndisplease them, and immediately mend them, and set them vp straight\r\nagaine. If any Cattell shall pyll or barke them, you shall pull vp\r\nsuch Settes, and place new in their roome. Your Willow set would by\r\nno meanes be too long at the first setting, for then will neuer beare\r\na good head, and too short is likewise as vnprofitable, therefore it\r\nis held to be fiue foote aboue the earth, is a length sufficient: you\r\nmay head your Willowes once in thrée yéeres, or fiue at the furthest,\r\nand when you sée the bodies waxe hollow, you may cut them downe for the\r\nfire, and fixe new Sets in their places.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ordering of Ozier.]\r\n\r\nThe Ozier to come to his true profit and season asketh much pruning\r\nand trimming, as namely you must kéepe the stocke lowe, and neuer\r\naboue halfe a foote aboue the earth, you must picke them cleane from\r\nMosse, and from the slime and filth, which the ouer-flow of the water\r\nwill leaue vpon them: you shall prune the small spiers, and make them\r\ngrow single one by another, and if any shoote out a double stalke, you\r\nshall cut it away, you may head them euery second yéere at the fall\r\nonely, and though some head them once a yéere, yet it is not so good\r\nhusbandry, nor will the Ozier be so tough or long lasting. The best\r\nseasons for the setting of the Willow, Sallow, or Ozier is, either\r\nany part of the Spring or Fall, and the best time to loppe the Willow\r\nor Sallow, is in the Spring for fence, and in the Fall for timber or\r\nfewell; but the Ozier would be cut at the fall of the leafe onely. And\r\nthus much for the bréeding of Wood in the rich champaine Countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Plashing of Hedges, and Lopping of Timber._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What plashing is.]\r\n\r\nHauing alreadie sufficiently in the former Chapter spoken of the\r\nplanting of all sorts of quick-sets, it is méete now that I shew you\r\nhow to order the hedges being growne and come to perfection. Know then\r\nthat if after your hedge is come to sixe or seauen yéeres of age, you\r\nshall let it grow on without cutting or pruning, that then although it\r\ngrow thicke at the top, yet it will decay and grow so thinne at the\r\nbottome, that not onely beasts but men may runne through it, and in\r\nthe end it will dye and come to nothing, which to preuent, it shall\r\nbe good once in seauen or eight yéeres to plash and lay all your\r\nQuick-set hedges, in which there is much fine Art and cunning to be\r\nvsed. For this plashing is a halfe cutting or deuiding of the quicke\r\ngrowth, almost to the outward barke, and then laying it orderly in a\r\nsloape manner, as you sée a cunning hedger lay a dead hedge, and then\r\nwith the smaller and more plyant branches, to wreathe and binde in\r\nthe tops, making a fence as strong as a wall, for the roote which is\r\nmore then halfe cut in sunder, putting forth new branches, which runne\r\nand entangle themselues amongst the olde stockes, doe so thicken and\r\nfortifie the hedge, that it is against the force of beasts impregnable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to plash:]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The time of yeare.]\r\n\r\nNow to giue you some light how you shall plash a hedge, though diuers\r\nCountries differ diuersly in these workes, yet as néere as I can I will\r\nshew you that which of the best Husbandmen is the best estéemed. First,\r\nfor the time of yéere either February or October, is passing good, and\r\nthe encrease of the Moone would likewise be obserued.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tooles.]\r\n\r\nFor the tooles which you shall imploy, they would be a very sharpe\r\nnimble Hatchet, a good Bill, and a fine pruning knife. Now for the\r\nworke you shall enter into it, first with your Bill you shall cut\r\naway all the superfluous boughes and branches which are of no vse, or\r\nhinder your worke, and then finding the principall stemmes which issue\r\nfrom the maine roote, you shall within a foote or lesse of the ground\r\nwith your Hatchet, cut the same more then thrée quarters through, so\r\nas they may hang together by nothing but the outward barke, and some\r\npart of the outward sap, and this stroke must euer be sloape-wise and\r\ndowneward: then take those mayne bodies of the quick-set, so cut, and\r\nlay them sloape-wise from you, as you would lay a dead hedge, and\r\nall the branches which extend from those bodies, and would spread\r\noutwardly, you shall likewise cut as before said, and fould them\r\nartificially into your head, and euer within a yard or two distance,\r\nwhere a pretie Plant growes straight vp, you shall onely cut off the\r\ntop equall with the height of your hedge, and so let it stand as a\r\nstake, about which you shall folde and twind all your other branches.\r\nNow when you come to the top of the hedge, which would commonly not be\r\naboue fiue foote high, you shall take the longest, youngest, and most\r\nplyant boughes, and cutting them as afore-said, gently binde in the\r\ntops of all the rest, and so make your hedge strong and perfect: and\r\nherein is to be noted, that the closer and thicker you lay your hedge\r\n(so there be nothing in it superfluous) the stronger and better lasting\r\nit will be. Many vse not to binde in the tops of their plasht hedges,\r\nbut onely to lay the Quick-set and no more: but it is not so husbandly,\r\nneither is the hedge of any indurance: many other curiosities there be\r\nin the plashing of hedges, but this which I haue alreadie shewed, is\r\nsufficient both for the Husbandmans benefit and vnderstanding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The profit of Plashing.]\r\n\r\nThe profit which ariseth from this labour, is the maintenance and\r\ndefence of fencing, the preseruing and encrease of Quick-set, and a\r\ncontinuance of amitie amongst neighbours, when one liues frée from\r\noffending another. It yéeldeth a good Mast for Swine, and with the\r\nouer-plus thereof at these times of plashings, repaireth all a mans\r\ndead hedges, and brings good store of fewell both to the Brewhouse,\r\nKitchin, and Backhouse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The lopping of Timber.]\r\n\r\nNext to the plashing, is the lopping of Timber-Trées, which in those\r\nCountries which are bare and naked of wood, is of much vse, and though\r\nI cannot much commend it, because it oft marreth the bodies of Trées,\r\nyet I must allow it for necessary, because it is a néedfull rate, which\r\nthe Trées pay to their Planters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What Lopping is.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The season for Lopping.]\r\n\r\nThis lopping or heading of Trées, is the cutting off of the armes and\r\nvppermost branches of Trées, and suffering the body to grow still, and\r\nit may very well be done once in eight or tenne yéeres, either at the\r\nbeginning of the Spring, or at the end of the Fall, as you shall haue\r\noccasion to vse the wood, and immediately after the Moone hath new\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How you shall lop Timber.]\r\n\r\nNow for the manner of the worke, there is small curiositie to be vsed\r\ntherein, if your Axe be good and sharpe, for you shall but cut off the\r\narmes and boughes, smooth and cleane without nickes, rifts, or gutters,\r\nor any thing which may receiue wet, whereby the Trée may be cankred\r\nand spoyled. Also in cutting away of the armes, you shall haue a great\r\ncare rather to cut them away (if it be possible) vpward then downeward,\r\nleast when you cut them downeward, the waight of the arme sodainly\r\nfalling downe, riue and teare the barke of the body of the Trée, which\r\nis dangerous, and hath béene the spoyle of much Timber: which to\r\npreuent, you shall euer before you strike any blowe aboue, make a good\r\nlarge nicke vnderneath, and then after cut it downe from aboue, and so\r\nthe Trée shall receiue no hurt. Also you shall obserue to cut the armes\r\nclose by the body of the Trée, and neuer to desist till you haue made\r\nthe place as playne and smooth as may be, for to doe the contrarie,\r\nis neyther workmanly, nor the part of any good husband. And thus much\r\ntouching the plashing of Hedges, and lopping of Trées.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of Pasture grounds, their order, profit, and generall vse._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diuersities and vse of Pastures.]\r\n\r\nHauing alreadie sufficiently entreated of errable Grounds, Gardens,\r\nOrchards, and Woods of all kindes, I thinke it most méete (as falling\r\nin his due place) here to write of Pasture grounds, which are of two\r\nkindes: the first, such Pastures as lye in wood land, mountainous,\r\nor colde climes, and are enclined to hardnesse and barrennesse, and\r\ntherefore onely imployed to the bréeding and bringing forth of Cattell:\r\nthe other such as lye in lowe, warme, and fruitfull soyles, and are\r\nmost fertile and aboundant in encrease, onely imployed to the fatting\r\nand féeding of Cattell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of barraine Pastures.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Signes of barrainnesse.]\r\n\r\nAnd now to speake of the first sort of Pasture, which being somewhat\r\nbarraine, is preserued for bréeding, you shall vnderstand that it is\r\ngenerally dispierced ouer all this Kingdome, and particularly into\r\neuery Countrey, for according to the veanes and mixture of the earth,\r\nsuch is either the richnesse or pouerty of the same, and of those\r\nseuerall mixtures I haue spoken sufficiently before in that part of\r\nthis Booke, which entreateth of errable ground. Then to procéede to\r\nmy purpose, it is the first office of the Husbandman when he séeth\r\nand knoweth the true nature of his earth, and perceiueth from perfect\r\niudgement that it is of very hard encrease, which as the temper and\r\nmixture of the soyle assures him, so also he shall better confirme by\r\nthese fewe signes and Charracters, which I will deliuer: as first, if\r\nhe sée grasse slow of growth, and that no Spring will appeare before\r\nMay. If in stead of Clouer-grasse, Dandylion, and Honisuckle, you sée\r\nyour ground furnished with Penigrasse, Bents, and Burnet. If you sée\r\nmuch Knot-grasse or Speare-grasse, or if you perceiue the scorching of\r\nthe Sunne burne away the grasse as fast as the raine had brought it\r\nforth: or if you finde quarries of stone néere vnto the vpper swarth of\r\ngrasse; or if your ground bring forth Lyng, Bracken, Gorse, Whynnes,\r\nBroome, Bilburie, or Strawburie: or if your ground be morish, full of\r\nquick-myers, mossie or full of blacke Flint, any of these signes make\r\nit to be most apparant that the soyle is barraine and of hard encrease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bettering of soyles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sowing of good seedes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: For abundance of grasse.]\r\n\r\nAnd then as before I said it is the Husbandmans first office to prouide\r\nfor the bettering and perfecting of his earth, which he shall doe in\r\nthis sort. First, if he perceiue that the barrainnesse of his ground\r\nprocéedes from want of good Plants, as from want of Clouer-grasse,\r\nDandylion, Honisuckle, Cowslop, and other swéet flowers, then he shall\r\nrepaire into the fruitfull Countries, and there buy the hay séedes\r\nand swéepings of hay-barne-flowers, which he shall euery Spring and\r\nfall of the leafe sowe, as thin as may be, vpon such Pastures, as he\r\nshall either lay for meddow, or preserue for the latter Spring after\r\nMichaelmas. But if he respect not the goodnesse of grasse, but the\r\nabundance of grasse, as those husbands doe which liue in or about\r\ngreat Cities, then he shall dung those grounds which he will lay for\r\nmeddow at Candlemasse; or those which he will graze or eate in the\r\nfirst beginning of the Spring, at Michaelmasse before, with the oldest\r\nand rottennest meanure he can get, of which the best is the rotten\r\nstaddell or bottomes of Hay-stackes, or for want of it the meanure of\r\nhorse-stables, swéepings, and scowrings of yards and barnes, the mudde\r\nof olde ditches, or else good Oxe or Cow meanure, any of which will\r\nbring forth abundance of grasse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The imperfection of meanure.]\r\n\r\nYet thus much I must aduertise the Husbandman, that this meanuring of\r\nPasture grounds carries with it diuers imperfections, for though it\r\noccasion abundance of grasse to growe, yet the meddow or hay which\r\ncomes thereof, is so ranke, loggie, and fulsome in tast, that a beast\r\ntaketh no ioy to eate thereof, more then to holde very life and soule\r\ntogether. Also the grasse thus meanured which you intend to graze or\r\neate with your Cattell, is by meanes of the meanure so loose at the\r\nroote, that Cattell as they bite plucke vp both the grasse, roote, and\r\nall, which being of strong & ranke sent in the mouth of a beast, maketh\r\nhim loathe and cast it out againe, and so not striue to eate to be fat,\r\nbut onely to maintaine life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To helpe a slow Spring.]\r\n\r\nNow if your Spring be slow, and late in the yéere before your grasse\r\nwill appeare aboue ground, it is méete then that you enclose your\r\nground, and not only maintaine the fences with high and thicke\r\nQuick-sets, but also with tall Timber-trées, whose shade and strength\r\nmay defend many colde blasts from the earth, and adde vnto it a more\r\nnaturall warmenesse then it had before, for it is onely the coldnesse\r\nof the soyle which makes the grasse long before it grow. Also in this\r\ncase it is méete that you lay (as the husbandman tearmes it) all such\r\nPasture as you intend to graze at the spring following, in Nouember\r\nbefore, & so not being bitten from that time till Aprill following, no\r\ndoubt but your spring will be both good and forward. There be others\r\nwhich helpe their slow springing grounds by stocking them in the latter\r\nend of the yéere with great abundance of shéepe, who although they bite\r\nnéere to the ground, and leaue little grasse behinde them, yet they\r\nso tread and meanure it with their hot meanure, that it will spring\r\nafter it commeth to rest, much more early and faster then it was wont.\r\nSo that to conclude in a word, to make a barren ground spring earely,\r\nis to kéepe it warme, let it haue long rest, and meanure it well with\r\nShéepe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To help Knot-grasse and Speare-grasse.]\r\n\r\nIf your ground be troubled with Knot-grasse or Speare-grasse, it is a\r\nsigne of too much colde moysture in the earth, and in this case you\r\nshall with a great common Plough, made for such a purpose, turne vp\r\ngreat furrowes through your ground, and make them so descend and fall\r\none into another, that not onely the moysture bred in the earth, but\r\nthat which falls vpon the earth, may haue a swift passage from the\r\nsame, and so your soyle being drayned and kept dry, all those wéedy\r\nkindes of grasse will soone perish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To helpe Sun-burning.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To helpe quarries of stone.]\r\n\r\nIf your ground be subiect to the scorching or burning of the Sunne,\r\nthen you shall vnderstand that it is directly contrary to the last\r\nsoyle we spake of: for as that by too much moysture is made barraine\r\nby colde, so this by too much want of moysture is made barraine with\r\nheate: wherefore the Husbandman shall in this case draw all his\r\ndraynes, to bring moysture into his ground, which sometimes watring\r\nand sometimes ouer-flowing the same, will in the end bring it to a\r\nreasonable fertility, for it is a rule, that where there may be\r\nouerflowes, there can seldome be any hurt by Sunne-burning, vnlesse\r\nthat such soyles be vpon Limestone ground, or néere vnto other\r\nquarries of hard stone, which lying néere vnto the vpper swarth of\r\nthe grasse, doth so burne the roote, that the vpper branches cannot\r\nprosper. In this case the bringing in of water doth rather hurt then\r\ngood, wherefore your best course is partly by your owne industry, and\r\npartly by the labours of others, who are traded in such commodities,\r\nto let forth your ground to Stone-diggers or Lime-makers, who digging\r\nthe quarries out of the earth, and then filling vp the emptie places\r\nwith rubbish and other earth, the soyle will in short space become as\r\nfruitfull as any other, for it is onely the want of taking roote; or\r\nthe burning vp of the roote, which makes this kinde of earth barraine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To help Ling, Braken, &c.]\r\n\r\nNow if your ground bring forth Ling, Braken, Gorse, Whinnes, or such\r\nlike: you shall pare off the vpper swarth of the earth, and lay it in\r\nthe Sunne to dry, in the height or heate of Sommer, and being throughly\r\ndried, you shall lay them in round hollow heapes one sod ouer another,\r\nthen putting fire vnto them, burne them into ashes, which done, spread\r\nthe ashes, like a meanure, ouer all the ground, and you shall sée those\r\nwéedes will no more spring or grow in that ground.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To helpe morishnesse or quick-myers.]\r\n\r\nIf your ground be morish or full of quicke myers, you shall then by\r\nsmall draynes or trenches draw away the water, and turne it into some\r\nlower ditch or current, and so bringing the ground to a stability or\r\nfirmenesse, there is no doubt but fruitfulnesse, will presently follow\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To helpe mossinesse.]\r\n\r\nLastly, if your ground be mossie, and bring forth in stead of grasse\r\nonely a soft fussie and vnwholsome mosse, your onely best way to cure\r\nthe fault, is in the Winter time to tread it much with the féete of\r\nCattell, as by making of Hay-stacks in diuers parts of such ground, and\r\nso fodring your Cattell about the same, and so yéerely altering the\r\nplaces of your Stackes or Réekes to goe ouer all your ground, & without\r\ndoubt the treading of the ground will kill the mosse, and the meanuring\r\nof the Cattell, and the expence of Hay-séeds vpon the ground, will\r\nsoone bring the earth to much fruitfulnesse and goodnesse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The generall vse of barraine grounds.]\r\n\r\nNow for the generall vse of these barraine grounds, it is to be\r\nvnderstood, that albe by the meanes before shewed, they may be helpt\r\nor bettered, yet they are but onely for bréede or encrease of Cattell.\r\nWhether the grounds be seuerall and enclosed, or vniuersall and\r\ncommon: whether they be Woods, Parkes, or Pastures, or Heathes, Mores,\r\nDownes, or other wilde and vnlimitted places, and these grounds shall\r\nbe deuided into thrée parts, the first and most fruitfullest lying\r\nlowest, lying néerest to the riuer or some running streame, you shall\r\npreserue for meddow, and not suffer any beast to bite vpon the same\r\nfrom Candlemasse, vntill the hay be taken from the ground. The second\r\npart, you shall graze or eate from Candlemasse till Lammas, which would\r\nbe that which lieth most plaine and bleake, and most subiect to all\r\nweathers. And the third part, which is the warmest and safest, you\r\nshall graze from all-Hollantide till Candlemasse, and betwixt Lammas\r\nand all-Hollantide you shall eate vp your eddish or after-crop of your\r\nmeddowes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What Cattell are to be bred.]\r\n\r\nNow whereas I speake generally, that these barraine grounds are for\r\nthe bréede of Cattell, yet you shall vnderstand me particularly, as\r\nnamely, what Cattell for what soyle, for euery barraine earth will not\r\nbring forth Cattell alike, as some will beare a faire Cowe or Oxe, yet\r\nbut a little Horse: and some will bring forth a very goodly Horse, yet\r\nbut a very little horned beast, therefore you shall obserue that if\r\nyour ground lye any thing lowe, or be subiect to much moysture, and so\r\nnot extreamely barraine, but although the Spring be late, yet after\r\nit springeth, it yéeldeth a reasonable bit, this ground is fittest to\r\nbréede Cattell vpon, as Cowe, Oxe, and such like: but if it lye high\r\nand dry, if it be stonie or mountainous, haue much reflection of the\r\nSunne: or though it be some-what more barraine then the former earth,\r\nand in the best part of the Spring yéeld but a short, yet swéet bit,\r\nthis ground is fittest to bréede a faire and large horse vpon: but if\r\nit be extreamely barraine colde and moyst, stonie or mossie, so it\r\nbe replenished with any good store of Vnderwood, then it is fit to\r\nbréede small hard Nags vpon, or Geldings of a meaner size, Goates,\r\nwilde-Swine, or such like. And lastly, if it be extreame barraine,\r\ncolde, and dry, and altogether without any kinde of shelter, but\r\nsubiect to euery blast whatsoeuer, this ground is fit onely to bréede\r\nShéepe vpon, as we sée by daily experience in the seuerall parts of\r\nthis Kingdome: so that to conclude, you shall beare in your memorie,\r\nthat where you bréede your beast, would be reasonable bit: where you\r\nbréede your Horse good ayre and warmth, and where you bréede your\r\nShéepe, there much spaciousnesse of ground. And thus much briefly for\r\nthe nature and vse of your barraine grounds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of fertill grounds.]\r\n\r\nNow to procéede to your fruitfull and rich grounds, whose very encrease\r\nand abundance of grasse, without any other curious relation shewes\r\ntheir fertility, there is little obseruation to be held in the ordering\r\n& disposing of them, for being naturally good of themselues, there\r\nnéedeth little Art to the maintainance of the same, onely to haue an\r\nespeciall care to the fencing and safe kéeping of them, to the due time\r\nof eating them with your Cattell, and to obserue a fit proportion\r\nof rest for them, in which they may grow and gather head for the\r\nmaintainance of such beasts as shall féede vpon them. And to these, as\r\nan especiall rule aboue the rest, must be added a carefull diligence\r\nnot to ouer-stocke or loade your ground with more Cattell then it may\r\nconueniently beare, for if your ground be neuer so fruitfull, if it be\r\nouer-prest with multitudes of Cattell, it cannot by any meanes yéeld\r\nyou the profit of your expectation, but returne you losse and dammage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The deuision of rich grounds.]\r\n\r\nThese fruitfull and rich grounds would be deuided into two parts,\r\nthe one pastures, or grounds for continuall féeding or nourishing of\r\nCattell all the yéere, the other meddowes, from whence you shall gather\r\nyour Winters prouision of Hay, for the preseruation of your Cattell,\r\nwhich are either for labour or sale in the Market, and of these two\r\nparts I will speake seuerally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The generall vse of rich grounds.]\r\n\r\nYet before I begin to speake largely of them, it is méete you know the\r\ngenerall vse of these rich and fruitfull grounds, which is indéede\r\nthe féeding or fatting vp of Cattell, either for foode in your owne\r\nhouse, or for sale in the Market, to the Butcher, Drouer, or men\r\nof such like place or profession. For indéede to bréede much vpon\r\nthese rich grounds, is neither profitable to the Husbandman, nor is\r\nthe beaste so bred, either so comely or Market-able, as those bred\r\nin the harder soyles, as wée may note in our experience, if we will\r\nsuruay the bréedes of Cattell in _Gloster_-shire, _Sommerset_-shire,\r\nand _Lincoln_-shire, which for the most part are bred vpon excéeding\r\nrich and fertile ground: yet if we take view of them, we shall finde\r\nthat albe they are tall and large, yet they are of slender shape,\r\nleane-thighed, crumple-horned, and oft tender and dry skinned, which\r\nis a fault very note-worthie amongst Graziers, and indéede are nothing\r\nso eyely and Market-able, as those beasts are which are bred in\r\n_Yorke_-shire, _Darby_-shire, _Lancashire_, and such like, all which\r\nare bred vpon hard and barraine grounds, yet haue goodly, large, and\r\nround bodies, close trust, thicke, and well coupled together, faire\r\nheads, veluet skinnes, and as the Prouerbe is, are so beautifull in\r\nhorne and haire, that they are euery mans money, in euery Market. So\r\nthat I conclude, that albe vpon the rich ground you may bréede good\r\nCattell, and it is necessary also so to doe for the maintaynance of\r\nstocke, yet the generall vse, and that which is the greatest profit to\r\nthe English husbandman, is to graze and féede the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Pastures and ordering them.]\r\n\r\nNow to procéede to my former purpose, touching that part of rich ground\r\nwhich I call Pasture, because it is onely for féeding, you shall first\r\nprouide that they be very well fenced, according to the nature of the\r\nCountry, either with ditch, pale, rayle, dead hedge, or quicke-growth:\r\nyou shall also sée that they be well stored with water, that is swéet\r\nand wholesome, for putrified water bréedeth many mortall and infectious\r\ndiseases amongst Cattell. These Pastures must euer be your highest\r\nground, and such as lye safest from inundations. Those Pastures which\r\nyou lay or giue rest to from the beginning of Nouember, you may féede\r\nat Candlemasse following with heilding beasts, or such as are but\r\nbeginning to féede, but with your fat beasts not till our Ladies day\r\nafter: those Pastures which you lay or giue rest to at Candlemasse, you\r\nmay very well féede at May following: those which you giue rest to at\r\nMay-day, you may féede at Midsommer, for then the spring is swift and\r\nplentifull: those you lay at Midsommer, you may féede at Lammas, those\r\nyou lay at Lammas, you may féede in October, and generally all the\r\nWinter following: onely you shall obserue, that those Pastures which\r\nlye most in danger of water, or any other casualtie, be first eaten,\r\nleast by too long delaying an vnseasonable time come, and so you be\r\nboth preuented of your hope and profit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manner of feeding of cattell.]\r\n\r\nIn the eating of your Pasture grounds, are many things to be obserued,\r\nas first for the féeding of your fat Cattell, you must by all meanes\r\nbe sure that they haue full bite, which is to say, length of grasse:\r\nfor cattell, whose tongues are the principall gatherers vp of their\r\nfoode, neither can nor will bite néere vnto the ground, except it be\r\nextreame hunger which compels them, and then they take little ioy in\r\ntheir foode. Next you shall oft (as any fit occasion will giue you\r\nleaue) remoue and shift them into fresh grounds, and not expect that\r\nthey should eate your grasse downe to the bottome, but onely as it were\r\nscumme and take the vppermost and choisest part thereof, and so they\r\nwill féede both swiftly and throughly: and for that grasse which they\r\nshall leaue behinde them, you shall eate it vp after them with your\r\nlabouring or worke-cattell, and lastly with your shéepe. It is very\r\ngood also amongst your fat beasts euer to haue a leane horse or two:\r\nfor your fat beasts taketh delight to féede with them, and sometimes\r\nto bite after them, there being as it were a kinde of sympathie or\r\nliking of each others tastes. After your grasse is fully knit, and\r\nhath receiued his whole strength, which wil be at Midsommer, then you\r\nmay suffer your fat beast to eate a little néerer vnto the ground\r\ntill after Lammas, because there is an extraordinarie swéetnesse\r\ntherein, springing from the heate of the Sunnes beames onely. These few\r\nobseruations well kept, there is no doubt but your Cattell will féede\r\nwell to your contentment, then when you sée that they are sufficiently\r\nfed, according to the ayme of your purpose, whether it be for the vse\r\nof your houshold, or the vse of the Market, you shall forth-with imploy\r\nthem accordingly, for it is both the losse of time and money, not to\r\nput them off by sale or otherwise, so soone as they are come to the\r\nend of your desire. For those rich grounds will sometimes make two\r\nreturnes in the yéere, sometimes thrée, which is a great profit. And I\r\nhaue heard sometimes of foure, but it is very rare, and the Cattell so\r\nreturned must be very well stricken with flesh before they be put vnto\r\nféeding, but if your ground will returne leane beasts fat twice through\r\nthe yéere, it is commodity sufficient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to know a fat Beast.]\r\n\r\nNow because it is not sufficient to say sell or kill your Cattell\r\nwhen they are fat, except you haue the Art and skill to know the\r\nsame, you shall obserue these few rules following, and they will\r\nsufficiently instruct you in the same. First, when you sée your beast\r\nin the generall shape and composure of his body shew most faire and\r\nbeautifull, each member being comely, and each bone couered, in such\r\nsort as a perfect shape requireth, as no eye is so stupid as cannot\r\ntell when a beast looketh well or ill-fauouredly, you shall then guesse\r\nthe beast to be well fed, especially when you sée his huckle-bones\r\nround and not sharpe, his ribs smooth, not rough, his flankes full, his\r\nnatch thick, and his cod round. This when you shall perceiue, you shall\r\nhandle him, and griping him vpon the neathermost ribs, if you féele\r\nthe skinne loose, and the substance soft vnder your hand, you may be\r\nwell assured that the beast is very well fed outwardly, that is vpon\r\nthe bones. You shall then lay your hand vpon his round huckle-bones,\r\nand if that féele, vnder your hand, soft, round and plumpe, you shall\r\nbe assured that the beast is well fed both outwardly and inwardly,\r\nthat is, both in flesh and tallow: then you shall handle him at the\r\nsetting on of his taile, and if that handle bigge, thicke, full, and\r\nsoft, it is a true signe that the beast is very well fed outwardly:\r\nthen handle his natch-bones which are on both sides the setting on of\r\nhis taile, and if they féele soft and loose, it is a signe that he is\r\nwell fed, both outwardly and inwardly. Lastly, you shall handle his cod\r\nand nauell, if it be of an Oxe, and the nauell onely if it be a Cowe,\r\nand if they handle thicke, round, soft, great, and plumpe, it is a most\r\nassured signe that the beast is very well tallowed within. And thus\r\nwhen any of these parts or members shall handle in contrary manner,\r\nyou shall iudge of the contrary effects. And thus much touching the\r\nknowledge of a fat beast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of Meddowes and their ordering.]\r\n\r\nNow for the second part of these rich grounds, which are meddowes,\r\nthey ought to be the most fruitfullest and richest of all other, lying\r\nlow and leuell, and being now and then in the Winter season washt with\r\ninundations, yet not too too much drencht or washt with the same: for\r\nas the moderate ouerflowing of waters enricheth and fertiles the soyle,\r\nto the too much soking or long resting of the water rotteth the earth,\r\n& bringeth it to barrainnesse, neither is it altogether necessary that\r\neuery meddowe should lye so low that it might be ouerflowed, for there\r\nbe some high grounds which are frée from those floods which will beare\r\nmeddow in very sufficient manner, & although the lower meddowes doe\r\nabound in the plenty of grasse, yet the higher grounds euer beareth\r\nthe swéeter grasse, and it is a rule amongst Husbandmen, that the low\r\nmeddowes do fill, but the high meddowes do féede, the low are for the\r\nStable, but the high are for the Cratch, and that which is long will\r\nmaintaine life, but that which is short will bréede milke.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preseruation of Meddowes.]\r\n\r\nThe chiefest respect you shall haue to your meddowes, is to defend and\r\npreserue them from Moales, and such like vermine, which roote vp the\r\nearth, and destroy the swéet and tender roots of the grasse. Next, that\r\nyou note in what places of the meddow the water standeth longest, &\r\nfrom thence, by small furrowes or draynes, to giue it a frée passage,\r\nso that the meddow may as it were cleanse & be dry in one instant.\r\nLastly, you shall maintaine the banks of all such ditches & other\r\nfences bordring about your meddowes in good and sufficient manner, both\r\nfor kéeping out of water after your meddowes begin to grow, as also for\r\nkéeping Cattell from eating them in the night or other times, which is\r\na great depriuation and losse of the profit you expect to come from\r\nthem: for you shall vnderstand, that if any ouerflow shall come vnto\r\nyour meddowes after May, it will leaue such a sandy filthinesse in the\r\ngrasse, that except very moderate showers fall swiftly, and sodainly,\r\nto wash it out againe, the Hay which shall be got of that crop, will\r\nboth be vnsauorie and vnwholsome, and bréed in your Cattell many\r\ndangerous and mortall sicknesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When to lay Meddowes.]\r\n\r\nThe best times for laying of meddowes to rest, is, if the meddow\r\nlye high, as in vp-land Countries, or if the soyle be cold, or the\r\nspringing thereof slow, at Candlemasse: but if the ground be more\r\nwarme, temperate, & of some more fertility, then you may lay it at\r\nour Ladies day in March: but if the ground be most fruitfull, then if\r\nyou lay it at May-day, it will be early enough. Also in the laying of\r\nyour meddowes to rest, you shall consider the state of the ground, as\r\nwhether it be eaten néere and bare, and with what Cattell, as Horse,\r\nOxen, or Shéepe: if it haue béene eaten bare with Oxen or Horse, then\r\nyou shall lay it earlier in the yéere, for it will aske a longer time\r\nto grow againe: but if it haue béene eaten with Shéepe (although they\r\nbite néerest to the ground) yet you may lay it so much later, because\r\nthe meanure which they bestow vpon such good ground, will quickly\r\nhasten on the Spring: but if your meddowes haue not béene eaten bare,\r\nbut haue a good déepe fogge vpon them still, then you may lay them the\r\nlatest. Also in the laying of meddowes, you shall consider whether\r\nthey be common or priuate, if they be common meddowes, and that no\r\nolde custome binde you to the contrary, you shall lay them to rest\r\nearely in the yéere, that recouering a forward Spring, you may cut\r\nthem so much the sooner, and so haue the better after-crop, and the\r\nlonger time to eate it: but if your meddow be priuate, and at your owne\r\nparticular disposing, then you shall lay it according to your owne\r\nnecessitie, and the goodnes of the soyle, obseruing euer to giue it\r\nfull time of growth, and not to cut it till the grasse be full ripe,\r\nfor it is better to let it grow a wéeke too long (so the weather be\r\nseasonable for the withering of it) then to cut it two dayes too soone,\r\nbecause when it is too earely cut, it not onely looseth the strength\r\nand goodnesse, but also the substance and waight, and in the drying\r\nshrinketh and wasteth to nothing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When to mow Meddowes.]\r\n\r\nTouching the fittest time to cut or mowe your meddowes: If they be\r\nlaid in a due season, it is held of all the best English husbandmen\r\ngenerally to be a wéeke or a fortnight after Midsommer day, as namely\r\nabout the translation of Thomas, which is euer the seauentéenth day of\r\nIuly, and without question it is a very good time for all men to begin\r\nthat labour, if their grounds be fruitfull and of earely growth: but\r\nin as much as diuers grounds are diuers in their growth, some being\r\nmuch more hastie then other some: and for as much as some meddow may\r\nas well grow too long as too little a time, as in high land Countries,\r\nwhere the heate and reflection of the Sunne will burne and consume away\r\nthe grasse, if it be not gathered in a due season, I would therefore\r\nwish euery good Husbandman about a wéeke before Midsommer, and a wéeke\r\nafter, to view his meddowes well, and if he sée them turne browne, if\r\nthe Cock-heads turne downeward and stand not vpright, if the Bels and\r\nother vessels of séede open and shed their séedes, if your Honisuckles\r\nhaue lost their flowers, and the Penigrasse be hard, dry, and withered,\r\nthen you shall truly vnderstand that your meddow is ripe and ready\r\nto be mowne, and the longer it standeth, the more it will loose of\r\nthe substance, and when any of the contrary signes appeare, as when\r\nthe meddow lookes gréene and fresh, the Cock-heads looke vpright, the\r\nBels are close and hard, the Honisuckles flowing and purple, and the\r\nPenigrasse soft and moyst, then is your meddow not readie to cut, nor\r\nwill the Hay that is so gotten be other then soft, fuzzie, and most\r\nvnwholsome, no beast taking delight to eate of the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inclination of the weather.]\r\n\r\nNow to these considerations, you shall adde a carefull obseruation\r\nof the state and inclination of the weather, and if you finde that\r\nthe weather is disposed to much wet or incertaintie, then you shall\r\nforbeare to mowe, because that moysture will still maintaine and hold\r\nthe grasse in his perfect strength so long as it groweth: but if it be\r\nonce cut downe, then the wet will soone rot and spoile it: but if you\r\nfind the weather enclined to drought and fairenesse, then you shall\r\nwith all spéede cut downe your Hay, for one loade got and brought into\r\nthe barne without raine, is worth two that hath béene washt, though\r\nbut with the smallest shower. There be some Husbandmen that in the\r\nmowing of their meddowes, will obserue the state of the Moone, and\r\nother planetarie coniectures, but they are fitter for those which\r\nséeke curiosities more then profit, for mine owne part I would wish\r\neuery good husband but to know truly when his crop is ripe, and then\r\nto gather it in the most constant and fairest seasons, which the rules\r\nalready set downe will most amply shew him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The manner how to mowe Meddowes.]\r\n\r\nNow for the manner of mowing your meddowes, although the generall act\r\nresteth in the hands of the mower, and that it is hard and impossible,\r\nin words, to expresse the Art of the action, nor is it néedfull that\r\neuery Husbandman be a mower, yet for those rules which the English\r\nHusbandman should know and obserue, I will in no sort omit them. You\r\nshall then know that in the mowing of your meddowes you shall mowe them\r\nsmooth, plaine, and leuell, and as the Husbandman tearmes it, with such\r\nan euen board, that a man may no more but discerne the going in and\r\ncomming forth of the Sythe: and this shall be done so close and néere\r\nvnto the ground, as is possible for the worke-man to get, especially if\r\nit be in publique and common meddowes, because the swap and first crop\r\nis all the maine profit you can challenge your owne: nay, you shall\r\ndoe it also in your owne priuate and seuerall meddowes: for although\r\nan ignorant custome haue drawne some of our Husbandmen, to say and\r\nbeléeue that there is no losse in the sleight and insufficient mowing\r\nof priuate meddowes, because say they, what I loose in the Barne,\r\nmy Cattell findes on the ground, yet they are much deceiued in that\r\nopinion, for what they so leaue on the ground halfe cut halfe vncut, is\r\nno good foode, neither pleasant nor sauorie, but dry, hard, and bitter,\r\nand indéede no better then sower fogge, which may fill, but cannot\r\nnourish, and who then will be so simple, as not to preferre swéet Hay\r\nbefore such vnsauorie grasse? therefore be carefull to mowe your grasse\r\neuen, and close by the ground, for it will make the fresh grasse spring\r\nvp with more ease, and be much pleasanter in taste.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to make Hay.]\r\n\r\nNext after the mowing of your meddowes, followeth the making of your\r\nHay, which is a labour that must be followed with great care and\r\ndiligence, for it is an old saying, that dearth beginneth at the\r\nHay-barne dore, and he that is negligent in that, can hardly be good\r\nhusband in any thing else, then to shew you how you shall make your\r\nhay, you shall first vnderstand that no one particular forme can stand\r\nfor a generall rule, because Hay must be made according to the nature\r\nof the grasse, and the soyle where it groweth, some being apt to wither\r\nand make soone, as that grasse which is finest, and hath in it least\r\nwéedes, others will be long in making, as that which is full of thicke,\r\nstrong, and sower grasses, many wéedes, bunnes, and such like hard\r\nstalkes, which are not easily dried, therefore it is the part of euery\r\ngood Husbandman, either by his eye and knowledge to iudge of the nature\r\nof his grasse, or else to follow the customes of the Country and soyle\r\nwherein he liueth, but the first, Knowledge, is the better Science.\r\nBut to procéede to my purpose, I will in the natures of two sorts of\r\ngrasse, the one fine, the other course, shew you the generall making of\r\nall sorts of Hay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To make fine Hay.]\r\n\r\nFirst, then for the making of your fine rich grass into Hay, if it grow\r\nin great abundance, thicke and close, and so lieth in the swathe, you\r\nshall haue one with a Pitch-forke to follow the Mowers, and to spread\r\nand throw the grasse thinne abroad, that the ayre and sunne-beames may\r\npasse through it: and this is called in most Countries tedding of Hay.\r\nThe next day, after the Sunne hath taken the dewe from the ground, you\r\nshall turne that which the day before you tedded, and then if you haue\r\nany more new mowen, you shall ted it also. The next day following,\r\nas before, when the dewe is from the earth, you shall turne your Hay\r\nagaine, and so letting it lye till the Sunne be at his height, begin\r\nto stir it againe, at which time if you finde it is reasonably well\r\nwithered, you shal then draw it into windrowes, that is, you shall\r\nmarke which way the winde standeth, and the same way that it bloweth,\r\nthe same way with Forks & Rakes one after another, gather in the Hay\r\ninto long, great, thicke rowes: then you shall make those windrowes\r\ninto large Cockes, of which the biggest is euer the best, for they will\r\ndefend themselues from raine, if happily any shall fall, whereas the\r\nlittle small Cocke lying light together, taketh in the raine like a\r\nspunge, and so makes the Hay a great deale much worse then otherwise\r\nit would be; when your Hay is thus set in safe Cocke, you shall let\r\nit rest a day or two, that it may take a little sweat therein, which\r\nwill make the Hay wondrous pleasant and swéet, then when the Sunne is\r\ngot vp to a pretie height, you shall open those Cockes, and after the\r\nsunne and winde hath passed through them, you may if the grasse be\r\nclean & fine of it selfe, without ranke grasse, load it, and carrie\r\nit either into the Barne, or such other place, as you haue appointed\r\nfor the receit thereof: but if it haue any ranke grasse, which you\r\nsée vnwithered amongst it, then you shall make it vp againe into safe\r\ncockes, and so let it rest a day or two more before you leade it away.\r\nAnd thus much for the making vp of fine Hay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To make course Hay.]\r\n\r\nNow for the making of course grasse into Hay, which you must suppose to\r\nbe grasse growing, in colde, moyst, woodie, and barraine grounds, full\r\nof wéedie, rough, and stumpie hearbage, long in growing, late ere it\r\ncan be gathered, and therefore depriued of much of the Sunnes strength,\r\nto swéeten and wither it. This grasse as soone as it hath béene mowne\r\nand tedded, as is before said: the next day you shall make it into\r\nlittle grasse Cockes, as bigge as little Moale-hilles, and so hauing\r\nlayne a day or better, then breake them open, and let them receiue the\r\nsunne and winde, for they will heat and sweat a little in the grasse,\r\nwhich make it Hay the sooner & better: then after the Sunne hath spent\r\nall his power vpon it, you shall make it vp into little Cockes againe,\r\nputting two of the first Cockes into one, then hauing so layne another\r\nday, breake them open againe, and giue them the Sunne: then make them\r\nvp againe, and put thrée or foure of those Cockes into one, and so let\r\nthem lye another day, then breake them open as before, if the Sunne\r\nshine faire, and at euening make them vp againe, putting thrée or foure\r\nof those Cockes into one, and so euery morning after the Sunne is vp\r\nbreake them open, and at euening make them vp againe, till you finde\r\nthat the Hay is sufficiently well dried, and sweateth no more in the\r\nCocke: but in the morning when you breake it open it is dry, without\r\nstemme, smoake, or vapour arising from it, which both your hand and\r\neye may perceiue in the first stirring or mouing, and then you may at\r\nyour pleasure leade it home, and house or stacke it as you shall haue\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vse of Hay for cattell to breed or labour with.]\r\n\r\nNow for the vse of Hay, it is two-folde, that is, either for the\r\nmaintainance of bréeding Cattell, or Cattell for labour, or else for\r\nthe féeding of Cattell for the Market, or for slaughter: for the\r\nmaintainance of bréeding Cattell, or the Cattell which are imployed in\r\nyour Plough or other labours, whether it be draught or trauell, you\r\nshall make choise of the swéet, and well-dried Hay, which is of fresh\r\nand gréene colour, well withered, sound, and perfect Hay, though it be\r\nlong, loggie, and not excéeding much swéet, it matters not; for being\r\nwell Inned and dried, it will serue sufficiently for those purposes:\r\nand with this Hay to mingle sometimes Wheat-straw, Rye-straw, Barly,\r\nor Oate-straw will not be amisse for heilding, or bréede Cattell: but\r\nfor worke-beasts, except necessitie constraine, let them haue Hay\r\nsimple of it selfe, during the busie time of their worke, but when\r\nthey rest, you may vse your discretion. For the times of giuing Hay\r\nor foddering to such Cattell as are in the house, the best is in the\r\nmorning before they goe to labour, in the euening when they come from\r\nlabour, presently after their drinke, and at night when you goe to bed.\r\nBut for those Cattell which goe abroad, as Shéepe, heilding Beasts, and\r\nsuch like, to fodder them morning and euening, is out and out fully\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nNow for the vse of Hay for fat cattell, you shall make choyse of the\r\nfruitfullest, swéetest, finest, and shortest Hay you haue, being full\r\nof flowers, pleasant and odoriferous to smell on: and although this\r\nHay be mixt with some roughnesse, yet it is not the worse, for though\r\nyour fat beast make thereof great orts, yet is the losse not great,\r\nfor those orts may be giuen to other heilding and hungrie cattell,\r\nwhich will eate them with great eagernesse. This Hay would in the first\r\ngathering not be withered too sore but so stackt-vp with a little\r\nhartie gréennesse that it may a little mow-burne, and alter the colour\r\nto a Redish brounnesse, but by no meanes so moyst that it may mould,\r\nrot, or putrifie, for that is fulsome and bade, but onely alter the\r\ncolour, and therby make the smell swéeter and stronger. This Hay will\r\nentice a beast to eate, and will strengthen and inable his stomacke,\r\nand withall will bréed in him such a drought or thirst, that hardly any\r\nwater will quench him, and the Grazier takes it euer for an infallible\r\nsigne, that when his beast drinkes much he féeds fast and his tallow\r\nwonderfully increaseth. For the ordinarie times of foddring your fat\r\ncattell, if they be in the stall, and as we say, tyed vp by the head,\r\nthe best is in the morning before and after water, at noone; in the\r\neuening before & after water, and late in the night, when you goe\r\nto bed, but if they féede abroad, and take the benefit of Fogge and\r\nafter-grasse, then to fodder them Morning, Euening, and high-noone is\r\nfully sufficient.\r\n\r\nHere I could speake of Pease-féeding of Shéep, Swine, and other cattel,\r\neyther at the Trough, Reeke, Stacke, or such like, the seuerall\r\nmanner of cratches, fashions of stals, and many other necessary rules\r\nappertaining to this mysterie; but I am against my will confined,\r\nand therefore must referre it to some other occasion, being loath to\r\nspoyle an excellent discourse, with a tale halfe tould, and imperfectly\r\nspoken: And thus much therefore of Meddowes, and these seuerall vses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_A new method for the husbandly curing of all manner of Cattels\r\ndiseases._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reason for this Chapter.]\r\n\r\nOf this Theame I haue written a whole (or as some will suppose many)\r\nHistories, yet doubtlesse nothing too much, the cause is so necessary\r\nand commodious: yet this I must let euery Reader vnderstand, that what\r\nI haue herein formerly done, I did for a general and vncontrollable\r\nsatisfaction to the whole Kingdome, both the learned and vnlearned, and\r\nas well to satisfie the nicest and most curious opinion, as the simple\r\nand playne dealing creature: whence it came that I waded Artfully\r\nand profoundly into the vttermost secrets of this knowledge, leauing\r\nnothing vnsearcht, or vnset downe, that might any way tend to the\r\nsatisfaction of any iudiciall Reader, and therefore tooke liberty to\r\nmake a large progresse, without sparing any paynes, to make my worke\r\nabsolutely most perfect. But now, hauing onely to doe with our honest\r\nplayne English Husbandman, who eyther cannot much read, or else hath\r\nlittle leasure to read, at most but a little memorie to bestow vpon\r\nhis readings; I haue here for his ease both of memory, readings, and\r\nother verations, drawne him such a method for the curing of all the\r\ndiseases in cattell, as was neuer yet found out by any man or Authour\r\nwhatsoeuer: and is worthy to be preserued to all posterities for euer\r\nand euer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Horses diseases to be cured with twelue Medicines.]\r\n\r\nTo beginne then first with the Horse, which is the Husbandmans\r\nprincipallest creature, you shal vnderstand that he hath, of my\r\nknowledge, one hundred and odde diseases or infirmities, besides other\r\nhurts and blemishes, for all which, I haue seuerally shewed seuerall\r\ncures, as may appeare by the volumes which are much too great for any\r\nHusbandman to carry in his braynes, and therefore for his ease I haue\r\ndrawne all those hundred and odde sicknesses or sorrances, into twelue,\r\nand will assure euery Husbandman that with these twelue medicines\r\nfollowing, hée shall perfectly cure all the diseases in a Horse,\r\nwhatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of inward sicknesse.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Medicine.]\r\n\r\nTo procéede then in an orderly manner to the cures: Euery husbandman\r\nmust know that all diseases in a horse are inward or outward: inward\r\nas offending the vitall parts, or outward as troubling the members:\r\nto speake then first of inward sicknesse, I will diuide so into two\r\nbranches, that is, eyther it offends the heart, or the brayne: If\r\nit offend the heart, we call them, Feauers, Yellowes, _Anticor_,\r\nconsumption of lungs, Liuer, Splene, Gall or other intrals, Wormes,\r\nFluxes, Belly-bound, and diuers other of like nature: For any or all\r\nwhich, you shall first let your Horse bloud in the neck-veine, and\r\nthen giue him, during his sicknesse, to drinke, eyther in swéete Wine\r\nor strong Ale or Béere, if Wine a pinte, if Ale or Béere a quart, two\r\nspoonefull of the powder called _Diapente_, made of _Aristolochia_\r\nroot, _Gentiana_, _Myrrhe_, _Eboni_ and _Bachi lauri_, of each equall\r\nquantitie, and let it be well brewed together, and doe thus euery\r\nMorning fasting, and let the Horse fast two houres after it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second Medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf it offend the brayne we call them Appoplexies, Palsies, Staggers,\r\nColds, Glaunder, Coughes, mourning of the chyne, Migrims, dizzinesse,\r\nand a world of such like: and the cure is to take _Assafeteda_, and\r\ndissoluing it in Vinegar dip hurds therein, and stop it hard into his\r\neares for two Mornings together after you haue taken from him great\r\nstore of bloud at his necke-veine, and then giue him to drinke, during\r\nhis sicknesse, euery Morning a quart of Milke, wherein the white and\r\nrough cankerrous Mosse of an old Oake pale hath béene sodden till\r\nthe Milke grow thicke, then strayned & so giuen luke warme, and if\r\nyou finde that no heauinesse or dizzinesse appeare in his head, then\r\nyou may forbeare the bloud-letting, and the _Assafeteda_, but not\r\notherwise, in any case; and thus assuredly these two medicines alreadie\r\ndeclared will cure all the inward diseases in a Horse, whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of outward diseases.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The third medicine.]\r\n\r\nNow for outward diseases, they are eyther naturall or accidentall: If\r\nthey be naturall, they eyther grow from the generation, or bréede, from\r\nwhence a Horse is descended, or else from corruption of foode, or other\r\nvnwholesome kéeping; If they grow from the bréede and generation of\r\nthe Horse, we call them the Viues, Wens, Knots, or Swellings about the\r\nthroat: and for the cure thereof, take a peny-worth of Pepper, beaten\r\ninto powder; a spoonefull of swines-grease, the iuyce of one handfull\r\nof Rew, two spoonefuls of Vineger, and mixe them together, and put this\r\nequally into both the Horses eares, and so tye them vp and shake the\r\neares, that the medicine may sinke downe, and take good store of bloud\r\nfrom the Horses neck-veine, and temple veines, and vse this medicine\r\ntwo or thrée mornings together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fourth Medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf they procéede from corruption of foode, or any other vnwholesome\r\nkéeping which corrupteth the bloud, then we call them Impostumations,\r\nByles, Botches, Fistulaes, Polemill, and such like: and the cure is, to\r\ntake the loame of an old mudde wall, strawes and all, but let there be\r\nno Lime amongst it, and boyle this loame with strong Vineger, till it\r\nbe like a Pultus, and as hot as the Horse can abide it, apply it to the\r\nsore place, and it will not onely draw it to a head, and breake it, but\r\nalso draw it, search it, and heale it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fift Medicine.]\r\n\r\nThere be also other diseases which procéed from naughtie foode, and\r\nthe corruption of blood, and we call them Farcies, Scabs, Mangie,\r\nScratches, Paynes, Mallanders, Sellanders, and all of such like nature,\r\nand the cure is first to slit the hard knots, or rubbe off the scurfe,\r\nand make the sore places raw: then take yellow _Arsnicke_ beaten to\r\npowder, and mixe it well with fresh grease, and then therewith annoynt\r\nthe sore places all ouer, which done, tye vp the Horses head, so as he\r\nmay not knappe or bite himselfe, and so let him stand an houre or two:\r\nthen take strong old Pisse warmde, and therewith bathe and wash the\r\nHorse all ouer, and so put him to his meat: and in this manner dresse\r\nthe Horse or beast thrée or foure mornings, and it will be sufficient;\r\nonely you must not fayle to take from him good store of bloud at his\r\nnecke vaine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sixt Medicine.]\r\n\r\nNow if his diseases procéed from accidentall causes, as from wounds,\r\nBruises, Straynes, Galles, hurts in the Eyes, excretions, or broken\r\nbones, then you shall to euery one of these take these seueral\r\nmedicines which follow: as first, if they be wounds, in what sort\r\nsoeuer taken or receiued, you shall take _Turpentine_, Waxe, and\r\nhogs-grease, of each a like quantity, and melting them together into a\r\nsalue, dresse the wound therewith, and it will heale it, how great or\r\nlittle soeuer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The seuenth Medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf they be bruises, whether gotten by stroake, naughtie Saddles, or\r\nother rushes, from whence procéedeth many times old, putrified & most\r\nranckorous vlcers, you shall first if the tumor be onely swelled and\r\nnot broken, apply vnto it the fourth medicine of Loame and Vingar, but\r\nif it be an open old ranckorous vlcer, you shall take Hogs-grease,\r\nTurpentine, Waxe, and Verdigrease, of each a like quantitie, and being\r\nwell mixt, and incorporated together, dresse the sore therewith, till\r\nit be whole, for this medicine will abate and kéepe downe any spungie\r\nor naughtie dead flesh which arises and kéepes the sore from healing,\r\nand may therefore alwayes be vsed in such like cases, whether the sore\r\nbe new or old.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The eight Medicines.]\r\n\r\nIf they be straynes eyther of ioynts or sinewes in what part or member\r\nsoeuer it be, old or new, take strong Vinegar, Patch-grease, and\r\nWheat-branne, and boyle them together till they be thick like a Pultus,\r\nand then apply it very hot to the strayne, Morning and Euening, and it\r\nis a most certayne cure, and will kéepe the member from growing foule,\r\nknotted, or gourded, and will also take away all swellings or paynes of\r\nthe limbes whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ninth Medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf they be Galles, of what kinde or nature soeuer, whether on the\r\nbacke, limbes, or any other outward part of the bodie, you shal take\r\nfirst fresh Butter scalding hot, and with it first bathe and wash the\r\nsore, then take thicke Creame, & mixing it with the Soote of a Chimney\r\ntill it be thicke, like a salue, with the same annoynt the sore place\r\nMorning and Euening, and it will cure it without any feare of dead\r\nflesh: if you doe strow vpon the sore the powder of Rossen it will be\r\ngood also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tenth Medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf they be any hurts in the eyes, as strokes, inflamations,\r\nPinne-webbe, Canker, or any other mischiefe whatsoeuer, you shall then\r\ntake true ground-Iuie, which otherwise is called of some Ale-hoofe, and\r\nbeating a good handfull thereof in a morter, with a spoonefull or two\r\nof white Rosewater, or the water of Eye-bright, then strain it through\r\na cleane wet cloath, and with that water dresse the sore eye Morning\r\nand Euening: or if you can conueniently thrée or foure times a day,\r\nfor the oftner is the better, and it will without all fayle cure any\r\nsore eye in the world whatsoeuer, eyther of man or beast, or any other\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The eleuenth Medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf they be excretions of bones, as Splents, Spauens, Curbs, Ringbones,\r\nor such like, in what part or member soeuer they be, you shall then\r\ntake white _Arsnicke_, beaten or ground to fine powder, and making\r\na little slit vpon the head of the excretion, the length of a Barly\r\ncorne, or very little more, yet in any waies downe déepe to the\r\nexcretion, & then with the poynt of your knife put the _Arsnicke_ vpon\r\nthe excretion, and so let the Horse stand with his head tied vp for two\r\nhoures at least, for in that time the greatest anguish will be gone,\r\nand then put him vnto his meate, and in thrée or foure dayes after the\r\nexcretion will fall away of it selfe; and then with a little swéet\r\nButter you may cure the sore, which will not be great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The twelfth Medicine.]\r\n\r\nIf they be broken bones, or bones out of ioynt, you shall after you\r\nhaue placed them in their due place, first annoynt them with the Oyle\r\nof Mallowes, or for want of it with warme Patch-grease, and then clap\r\nabout them a plaster made of Pitch, Rossen, and Masticke, and so with\r\nsoft and flat splents, so splent the member, as it may not moue, and\r\nso let it rest nine dayes ere you dresse it againe, and in any case\r\nso sling the Horse or Beast that he may not during that time, put his\r\nmember to the ground, which a little diligence and payne will easily\r\ndoe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diseases in the feete.]\r\n\r\nIf your Horse haue any infirmitie in his hooues as quitter-bone,\r\nouer-reach, pricke, crowne scabbe, rotten frush, or any such vlcerous\r\ndisease, you shall first lay it open, and then heale it with the\r\nseuenth Medicine. But if it be foundring, fretteshing, or such like,\r\nthen you shall first pare all his hooues cleane ouer, so thinne that\r\nyou may discerne the quicke all ouer, then let him bloud at the toes,\r\nand take great store of bloud from him, but in any case cut not the\r\nveine in sunder: then take the sixt medicine and, being boyling hot\r\n(after hollow shoes haue béene tackt on his féete) with Flaxe hurds\r\ndipt therein, stoppe all the soales of his féete vp hard, and thus\r\ndoe twice in sixe dayes, and it will bring his féete to their full\r\nperfection againe, without any great losse or trouble.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diseases in the priuie parts, or for stifling.]\r\n\r\nAs for the common infirmities in a Horses priuy parts, which are\r\nswellings, inflammations, incording, & such like, you shall but only\r\nswimme your horse in cold water Morning and Euening, and it is a\r\npresent helpe, both for them, or the stifling of a horse in his hinder\r\nioynt: Thus you sée these twelue medicines will sufficiently cure all\r\nthe diseases in Horse or Beast whatsoeuer, which who so will not carry\r\nin his memory, he is worthy now and then to be punisht for his sloath,\r\nand sometimes to suffer losse, which may make him more industrious to\r\nstudie for his owne good and profit. And thus much for the cure of\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n_FINIS._",
